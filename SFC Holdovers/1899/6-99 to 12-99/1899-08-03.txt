supposed to be personal revenge. The Vice

Commander Logan's request for per

in order to repair boilers was answered
by directions to remain at San Domingo

t)artment has taken the precaution to
MVf- a proper naval â¢ Dtation in
BB.n mingo waters for theÂ» reasons:
First â There are all sorts of rumors

Bhould it be discovered that
of thep^ expeditions ha>!

it may become necessary to land ma
rines for the protection of "ur consul
ate and other American citizens and
property.
Third â Tn prevent any undiK- f n -â¢â¢
Interference in the ev^nt of an up:
The Government's best official infor
mation is that Vice President Figuer<\
vho has assumed control, has the sup
port of all of the substantial people of
the island. The attitude of the admin
istration will be entirely friendly to the
nfw President and his Government,
and the authorities will exercise every
precaution to prevent any aid from
lawless persons in this country or Cuba
being given to revolutionists who may
Tnplate the overthrow of the ex
isting Government.
They do not anticipate that filibus
tering expeditions will be fittM out in
this country. Th^ danger points are
in Cuba and Hayti. In both places
there are a number of exiles, who, if
ran raise the money, may cause
s^rne troilble for the new Government
<.f San Domingo, and, should an expe
dition be fitted out in Cuba, consider
able trouble for the T'nited States.
g in military possession of Cuba
the United States would doubtless be
he-Id responsible for a violation of the
neutrality laws in case a revolutionary
party should start from that quarter.
As far as the authorities are informed
are no expeditions at present he
ir .g fitted out in Cuba or anywhere else.
Jiminez has already given the au
thorities a great deal of trouble and
his movements will be carefully
watched to see that he does not again
get us into international complications.

XEW YORK, Aup. 2.â Smith M.

E. D. York, secretary and counsel for

in the President and in the continued
prosperity of the Island. There is ab
solutely nothing in the Faris rumor. i
In fact, it is most arrant nonsense. The
idea that the United States is assisting

Powell at Port au Prince in enforcing
respect for the sanctity of the Tnittd

has been to discourage United States
officials in granting asylum to fugitives

in making the arrest within the legation

' LCS ANGELES, Aug. Marsha] P.
Wright of Ures, Mexico, who. is accom
panied by Judge Morales of Hermosillo,
to-night arrived in Los Angeles. Mr. â 
Wnght, who is a mining engineer and j
j operates mines <-n a large scale eighty
: miles east of Ures. gives employment I
to nearly 100 Yaquis.
"I do not believe the reports that
â  General Torres has been killed," paid
Mr. Wright, "and neither am I con- i
vinced that the old Indian chief, Tahie- I
ata. is dead. Torres has fought the
i Yaquis too long t" be caught by any
of their cunning."
Judge Morales says" General Torres,
; who conquered these savages several
years ago, will pursue the tactics of
driving them to the mountains and iso- i
lating them in bands that they may be
i more effectually attacked. Wright be- j
â  lieves that the present outbreak will
lead to the extermination of the Yaquis.
"When General Torres subjugated
them and the treaty was signed at To
rin." said Wright, "he emphasized the
fact that if they again rebelled it would
mean a war that would not end until
I the republic completely conquered the
tribe.
"Two Americans. Jack Remley, a
Hermosillo merchant, and Ed Miller, a
I photographer, have been murdered
' while going through the country."
Wright says General Torres is re
cruiting his regiment? to full strength
and when a decisive battle is fought it
will break the backbone of the present
rising.
M. DEL CASSE TO VISIT
COUNT MURAVIEFF
May Raise the Question of Conti

in the Transvaal.
PARIS, Aug. 2.â M. del Casse, the Min
ister of Foreign Affairs, started for -St.
Petersurg this afternoon to return the
visit of Count Muravieff, the Russian
Minister of Foreign Affairs. It Is reported
that M. del Casee also proposes to ar
! range the details of the Czar's visit to

, papers here intimate the French Foreign
, Minister may raise the. question of Con

Britain declaring war against the Tians
vaal.
There is no truth in the statement pub
lished in a NVw York newspaper co-dny
that strained relations exist between Rus
sia and France owing to President Loubet
having failed to telegraph to the Czar his
condolences on the death of the Czaro
witch. The President did telegraph, ex

also sent a wreath to be deposited on the

CLEVELAND. Aug. The police
believe they have made an arrest
U which may lead to important de
velopments in connection with the
several attempts to blow up Big
Consolidated cars since the beginning
of the present strike. This forenoon
John Schoenthal, a striking conductor,
was taken into custody on the charge
of being a suspicious person and has
since been detained at the Central Sta
tion, where he was subjected to a rigid
examination by the detectives. Several
days ago a well-digger named Stokes,
living at Nottingham, a suburb, told
the police that a street railroad man
had tried to purchase dynamite, from
him. The report was investigated and
the arrest of Schoenthal followed. The
prisoner admits that he is the man who
approached Stokes, but he says he
made the inquiry at the instance of
another man whose name he does not
know. He says he was approached by
the stranger, who asked him if he knew
where ten pounds of dynamite could be
purchased. The prisoner told the
stranger that he knew a man in Not
tingham who used dynamite ' and he
might have some to sell. Thereupon
he went to Nottingham, saw Stokes,
tmt I'ai.ert t<> get the explosive. He re
ported his failure to the stranger, ac
cording to his story, and that was the
end of the matter.
The police will not say what they
think of the story, but they declare
they are not yet through with the in
vestigation and they look upon the ar
rest as an important one. Schoenthal
had been .employed by the company
about four years before the strike be
gan.
There was practically no change in
the strike situation here to-day. Presi
dent Everett of the Big Consolidated
declares that his company has about
all the men required, and that the ser
vice now maintained on the various
lines of the system is equal to that
which was in force prior to the strike.
Mr. Everett states that he is receiving
applications from some of the strikers
tor reinstatement, and that a number
of union men have already been put to
work. . .

railroad service to the gulf ports is

To a representative of the Associated
Press Business Agent Pratt of the
ptriking Streetearmens Union said that
the boycott had practically passed out
of their hands.
"The people themselves have taken it
up, and where the movement will end
no one can tell."
Speaking of threatened prosecution
Mr. Pratt said: "Why don't they prose
cute some of the corporations which
place men on their blacklists and fol
low them up all over the country in
order to keep them out of employment,
sometimes for years. This boycott is
undoubtedly a great hardship to many
thousands of people. It is. however,
the only remaining weapon with which
to fight a powerful corporation like the
I Big Consolidated. Should we lose it
would have a demoralizing effect upon
organized labor everywhere. I have no
fear, however, as to the final result.
We will win out."
Good lawyers say the boycotters may
be proceeded against under the Ohio
anti-trust law, which covers conspira
cies of all kinds in restraint of trade.
One lawyer who has examined the law
says that merchants who refuse to s<=ll
goods to boycotted persons, as well as
those who assist in placing the boycott
upon them, aiding or abetting it in any
way can be convicted of conspiracy
without proof of the existence of a
conspiracy. The penalty provided is a
fine of from $60 to $5006 and imprison
mentof from six month? to a year, and
each day that the conspiracy continues
constitutes a separate offense. This
law passed at thÂ»- last session of the
Legislature, but the authors of it in-
I tended that it should apply only to

LETTER TO THE
CATTLE COMBINE
Smith Says It Was Not
an Indorsement.
TO ENCOURAGE INVESTORS
DOES NOT CONSIDER THE ORGAN
IZATION A TRUST.
The Capital of the Company Is Not
Sufficient to Secure a Corner
in Cattle in the State
of Texas.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
AUSTIN, Aug. 2.â Attorney General '
L. S. Smith stated to-day that he has
given the promoters of the gigantic cat- ,
tie combination that is now in process
of formation no written or verbal in
dorsement hi" their scheme.
His only action in the matter was to
respond to a letter written him a short
time ago by George B. Loving, the
Texas representative of the syndicate,
staling to the latter that the organi
sation of a company with a large cap
ital did not necessarily make such a
corporation a trust or monopoly within
the meaning of the Texas anti-trust
)h\v; that he was glad to see invest
ments of capital made in Texas and sa
long as the laws <>f this State are not
violated sur-h investors would receive,
the encouragement and pr Â»tection af
forded them by the laws of this State.
Attorney General Smith stated to
day, in further explanation of his let
ter to Mr. Loving, that it was not in
tended as an indorsement of the enter
prise. Should the syndicate assume j
euch large proportions as to monopolize
the cattle industry of the State, result
ing in influencing the price of cattle 'or
to crush out smaller competitors, it
would clearly come within the pale of j
the anti-trust law and would be sub-
Ject to prosecution by the State.
It is believed, however, that the syn- j
dlcate in carrying out its present inten- \
tion to invest not to exceed $40,000,000
in cattle and ranch property will not
assume the proportions of a monopoly |
and that its operations will be of benefit
rather than detriment to small stock
men of the State. It is estimated that ;
it would require a capital of not less
than $150,000,000 to establish a corner on ;
rattle in Texas and the Southwest.
COLONEL TREVELYAN'S
OFFER TO GROWERS
Beady to Contract for Crops of Sweet-
Wine Grapes at Fourteen Bol
lars a Ton.
FRESNO, Aug. 2.â A meeting of wine
grape growers was held in Scandinavian
Colony last night to receive the report
of a committee appointed at a former
meeting to interview H. J. Crocker in
regard" to his wine grape offer of $14 a ton.
Mr. Crocker informed the committee that
the time was too short in which to con-
Blder the proposition of buying the sweet
wine variety, his offer relating to the
dry wine counties alone.
A desire was then expressed to hear
from the local winery representatives
nt. Sigmuml Wormser of the Cali
fornia Wine Association stated that he
thought the time was too short to form
a combine, as only about three weeks
remained before picking would begin, and
he advised the growers to leave the mat
ter of prices to the natural competition
of trade.
Colonel Trevelyan, manager of the Bar
ton Estate Company, then surprised the
growers by making an offer to buy all
sweet wine grapes at $14 a ton and pay
$9 a ton for Second crop muscats. Two or
three growers signed contracts on the
spot for their entire crop, but the ma
jority held back. Mr. Trevelyan stated
that ali contracts must be signed within
twenty-four hours:
CONVICTS ESCAPE FROM
LEAVENWORTH JAIL
One of Them Was Killed While At-
tempting to Board a Train a
Few Hours Later.
LEAVENWORTH, Kans., Aug. 2.â
Three -desperate convicts from the Fed
eral, prison who were in charge of Guard
Knief escaped while at work digging a
grave for a fellow-convict that had died
Tuesday. The prisoners were Jack Holly,
a horsethief, convicted at Paris, Tex.; L.
Priest and Will Beebe, both from Indian
Territory for minor offenses.
While at work on the grave Holly
struck the guard on the back of the head
with a shovel. The other two men then
attacked th<- guard, stripping him nearly
I. and then left him in a dazed con
dition. The funeral party, arriving at
the cemetery and finding the guard in
this condition, took him in charge and
with the corpse returned to the prison at
Fort Heavenworth, where the alarm was
sounded.
Late to-nisht a farmer from Lin wood
notified the prison officers that Jack Holly
was cut In two by a Santa Fe train which
h* attempted to board. He held his gun
in his hand while attempting to board the
train, and when he felj the cars cut the
gun In two. The guard is expected to"
recover.

Pj>ecial Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 2.â Advices re
ceived by Surgeon General Wyman up
to 9 o'clock from Hampton show that
the only change in the yellow fever sit
uation Is the addition of four suspected
cases to those already in existence.
Those have been removed from the
camp hospital.- This information and
the additional statement that there has
not been a death since 7 o'clock and
that everything with reference to the
fliscu.se is more than favorable, was re
ceived from Governor Woodfin of the
Soldiers' Home. He also wired that he
is quite sure the pestilence will be
stamped out.
A special to the Evening Star from
Newport News says that Governor
Woodfin at 10 o'clock to-day gave out j
the following official statement:
"No new cases of yellow fever; no |
deaths; situation practically under j
control."
The Star special adds that many of
, the best men in Newport News have
I volunteered and are on the quarantine
line, which has been more than trebled
in the last forty-eight hours.
Some difficulty is being experienced
, in removing the troops from Fort Mon
i roe. Non* of the steamship companies
will take them, and Just at present no
; Government transports are available.
| Surgeon General Wyman made an
! other vigorous protest against sending
; the troops to Buttery Point, and ear
nestly recommended to the War De
j partment the advisability of placing
them further north. The matter was
; again taken up with General Merritt,
I who acceded to the request of Surgeon
General Wyman. The garrison at Fort
: Monroe will be sent to some place fur
ther north than Battery Point, â¢ Del.
The location has not yet been fixed.
Assistant Surgeon Yon Ezedorf, the
Now Orleans expert, to-day reported to
i the Marine Hospital Service his arrival
â  at Norfolk, en route to Old Point and
; Hampton, where he will assist Drs.

EXPERIMENTS MADE TO
IDENTIFY THE GERMS
WASHINGTON, Aug. 2.â The medical j
world at present Is very generally of !
the opinion that the specific bacillus
has not yet been identified. Recently
the announcement was made by San
arelli, an Italian scientist, that he had
segregated the germ of yellow fever j
and this claim was later affirmed by a j
German bacteriologist after a some
what less exhaustive research.
Surgeon General Sternbergr of the
army made a close study of the subject
and isolated a bacillus, which he did
not claim was the specific germ of yel- j
low fever, but one worthy of a closer |
study, calling it for convenience the j
"bacillus X."
The Army Medical Museum under j
General Sternberg's directions took up j
the subject, and Drs. Reed and Carroll
recently issued a preliminary note on
the museum's investigation, in which
they set forth that so far as deter
mined the bacillus of Sanarelli and the
bacillus X of Sternberg were identical
in their general forms and their effects
on the lower animals, and that both
seemed to be identical or very closely
allied with the bacillus of hog cholera.
Dr. Doty, the Health Officer at New
York, claims to have confirmed Sana
relli's discovery, and is carrying on a
series of curative experiments with a
serum for the destruction of the Sana
relli germ. The army medical officers
say, however, that no germ which can
Btand a temperature of 361 degrees be
low zero can be the germ of yellow
fever, which Is known to cease its rav
ages on the appearance of frost. The
Sanarelli germ was recently submerge-.!
in frozen air and came out ready for
business. The report of Drs. \Vasdin
and Geddings of the Marine Hospital
on their Cuban researches has not vet
been made public, but it is under
stood that they agree with Sanarelli.

NEGROES TO WORK
THE PLANTATIONS
The Suggestion of P. C.
Jones of Honolulu.
LABOR PROBLEM PUZZLING
ITALIAN PLAN BELIEVED TO
HAVE FALLEN THROUGH.
Some of the Best Results Have Been
Obtained by Men Working Un
der the Profit-Sharing
System.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
HONOLULU, July 25.â The best minds
of the city are giving great attention to
the labor question at the present time.
P. C. Jones thinks that it would be a
wise thins for the planters to employ
some thoroughly competent person to
study the matter up and present a re?
upon it to the representatives of the
planters.
"The fact is." said Mr. Jones this morn-
Ing, "the gentlemen interested in the plan
tations are too busy to make an exhaust
ive study of the subject, but a clear re
port laid before them could be easily mas
tered and understood. Moreover, if there
were any flaws in the report they would
easily detect them. For this purpose no
cheap man la required. It must be a man
conversant with labor conditions and of
more than ordinary capacity. I am no
longer a member of ,the Planters' Associa
tion but I feel convinced that this is the
best'wav of acquiring the information and
evolving a definite plan to meet the crisis
which is coming.
"Another thing that I advocateâ but it
does not meet with unanimous approval
is the introduction of about 2000 negroes
We have too many Japanese. I nave read
much that has been said against the
negro, but that does not apply to the class
I mean. What we want is men that will
come with their families. If 2000 are scat
tered among sixty plantations ihe fact
that they are here will be hardly noticea.-
Any one who noticed the negro regiment
that passed through must have been
struck by the fine physical development
of the men nnd their excellent behavior.
Of course, they were under discipline, but
I believe that just as well behaved men
are to be found ready to conic here with
their families.
â¢'Another aid to the solution of our diffi
culties 1 believe to lie in the adoption of
the profit-sharing system. About a year
ago I read a paper on the subject before
the Social Science Club, and everybody
I who heard it seemed to think the scheme
a good one; but it has rested there. I
! believe that the owner of an estate who
adopts profit sharing will have more
sugar and better results from MÂ« planta
tion than the owner who has merely paid
labor however cheap it may be. Not only
is profit sharing a key to our own situa
tion but It Is one to many complicated
problems on the mainland.
"As to the penal clause in the contracts,
I have urged its abolition for a long time.
It should have been done at the last ses
sion of the Legislature."
S. M. Damon is of the opinion that the
Legislature cannot be called together to
abrogate the penal clause. If it could 1>"
it wmild be a step toward the solution of
what must be solved only one way six
months hence. Others have suggested
that the penal clause be allowed to be
come a dead letter, but that could only
be by united action.
J. B. Atherton says that now the Italian
plan has fallen through and the attention
of the Planters' Association is now being
turned to the Portuguese scheme of W. O.
lrwin and to possible immigrants from
Russia, It has been plain to every one
that the penal clause would come to an
end when the United States assumed full
control, and therefore many people had
not interested themÂ«elves in It. When an
nexation was accepted the penal clause
was by that acceptance doomed.
REDWOOD CITY WILL
HAVE A PUBLIC PARK
Native Daughters Take Up a Project
for the Beautifying of Califor
nia Square.
REDWOOD CITY, Aug. 2â Redwood
City is to have a public park "in reality.
The members of Bonita Parlor, Native
Daughters of the Golden West, have taken
steps to institute this great improvement
with a determination to see the scheme
through to a finish.
Bounded by B, C, Third and Fourth
streets there Is a block of land designat
ed on the city map as "California Square."
Many years ago this tract was presented
to the corporation by S. M. Mezes with
the proviso that it Vie improved and made
an ornan.ental spot for the enjoyment and
recreation of the city's population. The
benevolent old gentleman has long since
been gathered to his fathers and the park
still remains a park in name only, bu( in
reality the corporation dumping ground.
An attempt was once made by the City
Council to improve the grounds and a few
sickly cypress trees remain to attest the
corporative spirit.
Trie Native Daughters are determined
that the hopes of generous Mr. Mezes will
be realized. In place of the waste of grass
and weeds lawns will spring up. Flowers
will bloom where unsightly heaps of dust
and refuse are now; there will be walks,
beautiful shade trees and seats, and in the
center a fountain of ornamental design.
The idea originated through a recent
visit of several young ladies, to Saaita
Cruz, where they found that a similar
project had been carried out by the
daughters. At a meeting of the parlor
here lust night the following committee
was appointed to begin the work; Mrs.
Dora Wilson, Miss Victoria Rousnel, Miss
I>ouise Roussel. Mrs. Isabel Stafford,
Mrs. J. F. O'Keefe, Miss Mary Doyle and
Mrs. Townsend.

Bush and Cooley were on their way to
Arkansas. They allowed Young to ride
with them one day, and that night he

GOLD ON BIG BEND.
Samples Brought Out by the Mayor

REVELSTOKE, B. C, Aug. 2.â Florence
McCarty, Mayor of Revelstoke, and I. T.
Brewster of this city returned yesterday
from Smith Creek, in the Big Bend district,
and brought both gold and good reports
back with them as the result of their
seventy-mile horseback trip up .the Bend.
Smith Creek, they claim, has Deeh pretty
thoroughly staked by a class of prospect
era who work on the principle that silence
is golden. There are other streams, how
ever, that are open 6r partially so to
prospectors. The gold brought in by
Mayor McCarty and Brewster consists of
quartz, nuggets and dust worth thousands
of dollars, the exact amount of which wa3
withheld, most of which was secured by
placer mining. Residents of Revelstoke
and neighboring places are much excited
over the Big Bend prospects.

PRAISE FROM THE PLATFORM
GOVERNOR PINGREE CRITICIZES
NEWSPAPERS.
Reception in the City Hall Corridors
at Which Mrs. Alger Was
Presentâ A Night of
Handshaking.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
DETROIT, Aug. 2.â Whatever may
have been said of the late Secretary of
War, General Russell A. Alger, con
cerning the recent incidents of his of
ficial career, all sentiments save those
of genuine happiness were very evident
ly banished this afternoon and even
ing by the magnificent welcome ten
dered him by the people of his own city
and State. From 4 o'clock, when the
welcoming committee crowded into his
private car upon its arrival at Toledo,
until 9 o'clock, when the general ceased
grasping outstretched hands, the scene
was a constant and spontaneous ova
tion. Smilesr and tears repeatedly
struggled for the mastery over the
Secretary's bronzed countenance as he
gazed into the eager faces of the mul
titudes who loudly and convincingly
insisted that "Aider's all right," and
no dissenting voice was heard. Dark
nt-ss fell during the speeches from the
reviewing stand in front of the City
Hall, giving opportunity for throwing
a searchlight upon the features of
General Alger drawn in crayon on a
canvas fifteen feet square hung from
the City Hall and surrounded by pa
triotic decorations. A great crush at
the indoor reception was the final fea
ture.
The special train which met General
Alger and party at Toledo consisted of
six coaches. It carried 400 members of
the reception committee. General Al
ger was escorted through the recep
tion train and greeted by all. About
300 bicyclists and over 100 marchers
escorted General Alger from the Mich
igan Central station by a circuitous
course leading past the general's house
to the reviewing stand. Military and
veterans of the Civil War, including
Fairbanks Post, G. A. R., of which the
general is a member, a company of
Spanish war veterans and scores of
marchers in secret society uniforms
filed past. Fairbanks Post carried two
great banners, stretching half way
across the street, which declared
"There's Only One Alger!"
When General Alger appeared upon
the reviewing stand there was a roar
of applause from the dense crowd
which blocked all traffic across the
Campus Martlus. The ex-Secretary re
viewed the parade and returned the
salutations of many marchers,
especially those of veteran G. A. R.
comrades.
Mayor Maybury, after calling for
order, said:
"General Alger, I should despair, sir,
of being able to voice the heartiness of
this welcome were it not already shown
in this vast concourse through which
you have passed. It will go forth to the
world sir, that where you are best
known, there you are best beloved and
best appreciated. It will go forth to
the world, sir. a due notice that the
standard of high character built up by
patience and perseverance, honesty and
uprightness cannot be thrown down by
slander."
Governor John Pingree, in his speech
read in behalf of the State, made some
pointed references to the. incidents re
lating to Alger's home-coming, and
fired some characteristic shots at the
newspapers, which, he asserted, were
largely responsible. The Governor said
that Alger's best service for his country
was in his efficient management of the
War Department.
General Alger, responding, said:
"I can command no language to ex
press my gratitude to you for this royal
welcome to my home. I am glad from
the bottom of my heart to be released
from official care and to again enter the
old home and live among the people
of Michigan.
"Since I went away, two and a half
years ago as you know,, the country
has been through a terrflble struggle.
The office of which I was at the head
was taxed to the utmost of every man'a
strength who occupied any position in
it I gave my best thought and honest
effort and did everything I could to
carry out my part of that great work.
What has been done is a matter of rec
ord and I am perfectly willing to- rest
the case with my countrymen."
The closing scene was a reception in
the City Hall corridors. Mrs. Alger
and scores of other ladies, with several
of the general's relatives, viewed the
scene from a platform built into the
main stairway and thousands pushed
past and grasped General Alger's hand.
ASKS FOR NO REDUCTION.

A Friend of Croker and Lantry Ac

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Aug. 2.â The most inter
esting thing that developed to-day In con
nection with the Mazet legislative investi
gating committee was the fact that every
member of the municipal council had been
subpenaed for to-morrow for the purpose
of determining why the present city leg
islative body should not be abolished.
A member of the staff of Mr. Moss. thÂ«
counsel of the Mazet committee, attended
the meeting In the municipal assembly
to-day and served the subpenaes. With
each subpena was a letter from Counsel
Moss saying:
"You will be subpenaed to appear before
this committee on Thursday at 11 a. m.
and will be treated fairly and honestly.
The assembly will be urged to convene and
legislate against the municipal assembly,
and I desire that your side of the contro
versy shall be correctly presenu-d."
The taking of testimony to-day began
with the examination of William Beard
of the W. X. Beard Dredging Company,
\V. H. Saver Jr. of the International
Dredging Company and Charles Loomis
of the Atlantic Dredging Company. Each
testified as to the price received for dredg
ing.
The examination of these witnesses was
technical. It was shown that the rate
for dredging varied from 12 1/ 2 to 12* i cents
per cubic yard. The witnesses denied that
there was any agreement among them to
charge the city exorbitant prices.
R. C. Packard of the K. C. Packard
Dredging Company said there had been
probably for thirty-five years an under
standing among the dredging companies
to charge good prices for their work, but
the agreement had been a lamentable
failurt, especially on Government con
tracts.
Charles F. Murphy, treasurer of the
dock board, testified that his department
had given considerable work to thÂ« Mor
ris & Cummings Dredging Company at
the market rate without public bidding.
The Dock Commission believed the com
pany to be a good, reliable concern. Mr.
Murphy said Tie generally allotted dock
department work to Tammany men when
he could. He had given contracts to the
Uvalde Asphalt Paying Company without
public letting. The law as he understood
it gave him the right to do this; if his
construction was wrong then he had vio
lated the law
Frederick Hall testified that he had paid
$300 to Julius Schroeder, a saloon keeper,
in order to get on the police force. Wit
ness said Schroeder was a friend of Com
missioner Lantry and Mr. Croker. Wit
ness had gone before the civil service
board and railed in the mental examina
tion. Schroeder said he would fix it all
right, but failed to do so and refused to
return the money.
The question of influence and method
connected with the changing of th>- mo
tive power on different street railroads

AGITATION AGAINST
AMERICAN PRODUCTS
Agrarians "V^ould Have Prohibitive
Inspection Laws Passed in
Germany.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 2.â Agents of the
Agricultural Department who are in Ger
many report increased activity on the
part of the agitators who are exerting
their influence to curtail to the minimum
the importation of American food prod
uct? into that country.
While these reports are not made pub
lic, it is known that they represent that
greater effort than ever before will be
made to secure from the next meeting
of the Reichstag a statute providing for
an inspection by agents of the German
Government of all American products
which shall be so strict as to entirely
ignore the certificates of American in
spection.
The agitation is conducted principally
by the Agrarians, and it is stated that
the press is being used to quite an un
wonted extent to create public sentiment
adverse to all American food articles.
Especial attention is given to our beef,
and liberal use is made of the testimony
taken before the War Investigating Com
mittee â¢ and the Beef Court of Inquiry.
This agitation in itself has had the effect
of reducing German consumption of our
meat products, but the officials here are
not especially apprehensive of legisla
tion.
POPE DENOUNCES ITALY.
Places Blame for Lack of Representa-

LONDON, Aug. 3.â The Rome corre
spondent of the Daily Mail says the Pope
through Cardinal Rampolla, Papal Secre
tary of State, has addressed a note to the
nuncios abroad denouncing the attitude of
the Italian Government toward the Holy
See in connection with the Hague Con
ference. The note says that all the Gov
ernments except the Italian desired to
see a papal delegate there.
"This unworthy spectacle will be se
verely judged by history," says the Pope,
"while the papacy will lose nothing by
the exclusion."
ITALIAN FLEET MAY COME.
Residents of New York Hope to Have
It- in the Bay September 18.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 2.â There is some
prospect that an Italian fleet may visit
American waters next month. A move
ment to that end has been on foot of late
among prominent Italians of New York,
the purpose being to have the fleet here
on September 18. when' Italy celebrates
a national holiday, and it is thought the
sailing north of the Italian fleet at Buenos
Ayres is the result of the movement.

SA.JT V BARBARA, Aug. 2.â A num
ber of Santa Barbara's leading men
led an attack to-night on the oil der
ricks erected in front of fashionable
residence property on the sea front at
Miramar. For some time there has
been a mad rush to place derricks along
the beach fronting beautiful Montecito,
and no orue has dared interfere until to
night, when a party, led by Charles
Fernald, Reginald Fernald, Cameron
Rodgers and W. "VV. Burton, with ten
men, went down to Miramar with two
large trucks and tools to tear down a
large derrick that had been erected
quietly to-day.
The men began working at 10 o'clock
and at 11:30 had rucceeded in bringing
the greater part of the works to the
ground. Beside the derrick there were
a complete set of well-boring tools, an
engine for the required power and a
carpenter shop. Before the night is
over all these will be lying along the
county road, for, as fast as they are
torn clown they are put upon the truck
and hauled to the county road.
The persons who erected the derrick
are not known to the owners of the
property which it faces. Several prop
erty-owners at Summerland Jed just
such an attack against derricks erected
by the Southern Pacific on the beach
of a year ago, and the
company took no legal steps to prose
cute them. The derrick torn down to
night is an unusually large one. a plat
form upon which it rests being twenty
feet square and the derrick forty-five
feet high.
At 11:30 o'clock the men were working
hnrvi anc j s till on the lookout for an
attack. They are armed and deter
mined to put up a n ,ht if need be. Mrs.

AUTOMOBILE HAS
REACHED BUFFALO
All Difficulties Being Overcome in the
Westward Journey Across the
Continent.
BY JOHN D. DAVIS.
BUFFALO. NT. V., Aug. 2.â Tn a heavy
rain and hail storm the transconti
nental automobile arrived to-day at
2:50 o'clock and ran down Main
street at a good rate of speed. The
run from Bergen was made in good time
and at a rate of twelve miles an hour
until near Monroevllle, when a strong
head wind and clouds of dust were en
countered and headway was delayed.
However, th- run of fifty-six miles was
made In four hours and a half. We were
delayed at the forks, nine miles out. to
gft gasoline and to wait for the automo
bile escort. A thunder shower delayed
the latter, and in a heavy rain we ran
into town alone. The motor has work. .1
perfectly all day and not a hitch has oc
curred " This is the ilrst day without
some trouble since leaving New York
and from now on I think everything will
work satisfactorily. At the forks to-day
a newspaper man being carried into town
slipped on the tailboard and broke it.
and we will delay to have it repaired, but
will get away to-morrow afternoon.
WIND PREVENTED
VERY FAST TIME
BUFFALO, Aug. 2.â An immense crowd
d the travelers as their carrlag
drew up in front of the News office. The
trip from Batavia to Buffalo was smooth
enough. Until Bowmansville was reach
ed the machine maintained a rate of
twelve miles an hour. Hut at Bowmans- i
ville the wind " shifted and blew
ahead, and the speed of the machln<
off perceptibly in the face of the wind,
the dust - blow in t
clouds. This was not conducive to much
either. The automobile behaved
splendidly in spite of the adverse condi- i
tions.
Forks Station was reached at 11:40
O'clock. This station is only two miles
from the city line and the automobile
party expected to be in Buffalo, running |
over' asphalt pavements, in a few min
utes. They were disappointed, for the
vehicle came to a sudden stop. It did not
take Mr. Davis many minutes to learn
that the supply of gasoline ha I
hausted. There was no extra Bupply I
aboard. So a reporter took the tra

BUG THAT LAYS
DANCING EGGS
Strange Phenomenon of
Insect Life.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDDING. Aug. 2.â The sulphur smoke
and arsenical fumes thrown off into the
otherwise clean atmosphere of Shasta
County by the smelting and roasting oper
ations of" the Mount Copper Company
have been responsible for more than one!
strange phenomenon in plant and insect \
life, but the latest expression is perhaps
the greatest novelty of all.
It has just been discovered that the
leaves of the common oak tree hereabouts
are swarming with embryonic life. Masses
of eggs, so small as to give the appear
ance of an unhealthy splotch, adhere to
the under side of the leaf, and as they ad
vance toward maturity they drop to t..f
ground and dance about like electrical
automatons. By holding an oak twig
containing any number of eggs to one's
ear a cracking sound may be heard like
the spitting of electric sparks. The shell
contains a tiny grub, working for release,
but what shape it takes upon reaching
maturity is unknown.
The curiosity is attracting a great deal
of local attention. In many places in
town collections of the eggs are on ex
hibition. A quantity- is laid on a table
and immediately they begin to disport
themselves, bounding about and spring
ing into the air sometimes to a height or
sixteen inches. They are particularly act
ive in the early morning.
No one is able to account for the phe
nomenon. A theory is advanced that
this embryonic parasite^ presence in such
abundance is probably due to the absence
of its natural enemy, the commoner in
sect life, which long ago fell a victim to
sulphur smoke and arsenical fumes This
latest insect novelty takes rank with the
sulphur bug, which is at home in the red
hot roaster piles stretching along the
mountain side above Keswlc

FRUIT PRESERVED
IN VACUUM CARS
Project of a Stockton
Inventor.
Facial Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON, Aug. 2.â The claim that
liquid air as a substitute for ice in cars
will greatly facilitate perfect preservation
of fruit in shipment in met by a Stock
ton man with a plan which he declares
is superior in every way. Frank E.
. who has devised the new system,
is already known In the inventive world.
He has a working model of his plan here,
but is preparing to give it a practical
demonstration on a car now being built
bis direction in Oakland.
("ovey has a practically air tight box
about a yard long and a foot and a half
wid'-, which represents a refrigerator car.
Attached to this is a pump, by which air
ctracted and a vacuum formed, as
nearly as possible. Into this box Covey
: â  'i a box of peaches, fruit that was
really too ripe to be shipped. He pumped
the box out every three or four hours.
Twi nty-two days after he placed the
s in the box he removed them, and
although the weather was unusually
warm, they appeared Identically the same
as when th>-y were "shipped.'' They had
not changed a particle. Rarefied air be
ing lower in temperature, it was several
degrees cooler in thÂ»- box than outside.
Covey's invention is based on the theory
that fruit would be preserved forever if
. article of air could reach it.
To ascertain the effect as to dampness
two wide-mouthed bottles were placed In
box, one filk-d with water and the
other empty. A vacuum was then cre
ated, and when the "car" was opened
there was no water in either bottle.
Covey will attach a pump to the under
side of the car, with a pipe running up
through the floor. The pump will be op
â  â  tea by what is known as a bali-and-
BOCket joint eccentric and will be run
from the axle of the car. In this way
â¢):â¢â  air will be kept continually exhausted.
By means of a relief valve when the
vacuum shows a certain pressure the
pump will be released from duty, pumping
in air through the chamber and out again.
As soon as the pressure is lowered the
relief valve will close and th<> work of
exhausting will commence again. The
pump to be placed on the first oar for a
test will be of eight-inch diameter, with a
ten-inch stroke.

The following resolution was presented

\\> commend the action of the lowa dele
gation in Congress in support of protection,
of the Dingley tariff, of the maintenance of
the gold standard and on â - .'aithtul support
or' the administration of President McKinley
in his policy in peace and war. We rejoice
In the prospect election of L>avid B. Hen
derson to be Speaker of the House of Represen
tatives and Indorse him as wholly worthy of
that honor. We readop< the following declara
tion from the lowa K^iubiican platform 'of
U9S:
"The monetary standard of this country and
the commercial" world is gold. 'me permn
nence of this standard must be assured by
Congressional legislation, giving to it the va
lidity and vitality of public law. All other
money must be kept at a parity with gold."
And we urgently, call upon our Senators and
Representatives in Congress to lend their best
endeavors to enact these propositions into law.
We denounce the Chicago platform and its
declaration in favor of free trade and free
silver coinage at the ratio of 16 to 1 and Its
attacks upon the irts as threatening the
American people with a departure from the
policy of good government that would prove
fraught with evil to the American people. The
enormities of that platform call for the re
sistance of all good .cltixens. As Republi
cans we make recognition of the loyalty and
exalted patriotism of the sound money Demo
crats and men of all parties who put aside
partisanship in order to maintain the good
faith of the nation and in resistance to the
Chicago platform and its candidate. To main
tain the welfare of the people is the object
and aim of all governments.
Industry and commerce should be left free
to pursue their methods according to the nat
ural laws of the world, but when the business
aggregations known as trusts prove hurtful to
the people they must be restricted by laws,
and if need be abolished.
Confidence in the high purpose of the
President, the skill of the officers and the
heroism of the men In the army and navy
are expressed, and moral and material
support promised them so long aa there
is resistance to the flag anywhere.

Rldgway were yesterday heroines of an exciting episode in the surf at
Redondo. They made brave efforts to save from drowning their com

alive is due to the act of the two young women, although Miss Carpen
ter nearly lost her life in the effort to save her friend.
The three, who are daughters of well-known Los Angeles citizens,
were bathing in Redondo surf. Miss Wells ventured out too far, and
finding herself helpless in the breakers, cried for help. Miss Carpenter
swam to her assistance, but Miss Wells, like all drowning persons, be
came unmanageable, and Miss Carpenter's danger became as great as
that of the friend she was trying to save. Both girls would have
drowned but for the aid of Miss Ridgway, an expert swimmer, who
hastened to their aid and by dint of hard work managed to get them
to the life raft.

DEATH OF E. R. LOWE.
Retired Yolo County Capitalist Passes
Away in San Francisco.
WOODLAND. Augr. 2.â E. R. Lowe, one
of the wealthy men of Yolo County, died
at San Francisco at an early hour this
mnrninsr. He had been in feeble health
for many years, but when he retired at
9 o'clock Tuesday night he was cheerful
and apparently as well as he had been
at any time for two or three years. His
death' was due to heart failure.
Mr. Lowe was a native of Missouri and
SI years of age. He married Miss Lucy
L. "Hodge of Kentucky on December 27.
1847. n 'hey came to California in 1&52. first
locating in Grass Valley and afterward
In Sutler County. The basis for Mr.
Lowe's fortune was Yolo County real es
tate, which he reluctantly accepted In
payment of a debt.
Mrs. Lowe died in 1W and Mr. Lowe
decided to relieve himself of all business
cares and responsibilities. He resigned
the position of director in the Bank of
Yolo. and distributed the bulk of his for
tune among his five children.
The body will be brought to Woodland
for interment.
ASTOR IS SILENT.
Will Not Discuss His Recent British
Naturalization.
LONDON*. Aug. 2.â William Waldorf
Astor has been besieged by reporters since
the official announcement yesterday that
he was naturalized a British subject on
July 27.
He absolutely declines to see any one.
but has authorized his agents to say that
he considers the matter purely personal,
has no explanations to offer, is quite pre
pared for the attacks of the American
newspapers, who attacked him when it
was previously suggested that there was
a possibility of his becoming a British
subject, and in conclusion that any inter
views purported to be with him are de
void of foundation.

THE COLUMBIA
DISABLED DURING
A TRIAL RACE
New Steel Mast Is
Snapped.
BREAKS SQUARELY IN TWO
ENTIRE SUIT OF SAILS GOES
OVERBOARD.
Previous to the Accident the New
Yacht Had Easily Outstripped
the Defender From the
Start.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEWPORT, R. 1., Aug. 2.â An accident
to the Columbia marred n hat promised to
l>e a. thorough test as to the relativo
epeed of that boat and the Defender in a
line topsail breeze, and late this antr
noon he new boat was towed to her
builders' works at Bristol a total wreck
above deck. Her new steel mast was
lent louble just about half-way between
the deck and the masthead and all that
remaii of her lagnincent spr< of
canvas and especially made, rigging was
piled up in a heap about the stump of
The mast, a tangled mass of wire shrouds;
metal turnbuckles, blocks and ropes.
Practically all that remained was iho
steel boom an I gaff and the bowsprit,
.and even the gaft was damaged a trine
lit the ...us.
The dismasting of the Columbia oc
curred less than an hour after the new
and old cup defenders started on the beat
out to a flagboat off the north end of
.Block Island, when the two contestants
had covered about half of the distance.
The Columbia was leading at the time
and was eadily drawing away from her
rival. The two boats were holding it
along a port tack and into the Point Ju
dith Channel, about three miles off the
point; the new boat having the weather
positi and fairly tearing through the
water, when there was a sound of break
ing spars and in an instant the topmast
went crashing lown to leeward, carrying
with it the fine new club topsail and small
jib topsails. The steel mainmast at once
buckled in the middle and down same
the upper end of the spar and the huge
mainsail dropped into the water on the
starboard side.
Fortunately all hands escaped injury.
The discipline was excellent, not a man
leaving his place until Captain Barr gave
orders to clear away the wreckage and
get the canvas aboard, and then the crew
went to work with a will, clearing up the
tangle, the Columbia drifting with the
waves, a dismantled and sad-looking
craft.
The Associated Press tug took the Co
lumbia In tow and proceeded with her to
Bristol. On examination of the wreckage
it was found that the port spreader had
broken upward by the strain of the top
mast shroud, causing the topmast to
break off. The sudden force of the spar,
the weight of the topsail and clubs com
ing against the starboard masthead
shrouds was too much for the steel mast,
and it instantly collapsed. The topmast
shroud, which Mr. Iselin said was the
cause of all the trouble, was not in just
the position to properly support th< top
mast, which fitted into the masthead, tel
escopic shion instead of being stepped
forward of it. The topmast shroud leads
upward through the spreaders to the head
of the topmast, and although the crew of
the Columbia swayed the topmast for
ward as much as possible for to-day's
race the port spreader was not able to
stand the strain.
The expense of repairing the Columbia
â¢will be heavy, and although most of the
â¢wire shrouds and stays can be used again,
they will have to undergo a severe test
as to their strength, for the wrenching
they recei to-day may have caused
them to be worthless. The hull of the
boat was noi seriously damaged, the only
perceptible injury being a large dent in
Â«-ne of the plates on the starboard side
just abaft the mast, cut by either the
blocks or spars striking it. The damaged
plate can easilj be bent Into shape, and,
being bo far above the water Hne, cannot
interfere seriously with the speed of the
boat.

COLUMBUS, Aug. 2.â This was a great
day of racing at the Columbus Driving
I'ark. The weather was Ideal and the
track was very fast. Searchlight paced

STEEPLX aiASC
WILL BE COMPETED FOR AT THE MONTEREY MEETING.
The officials of the Pacific Coast Racing and Steeplechase
Association are leaving nothing undone that would aid in mak
ing a social and a sporting success of their outing at Monterey
during the last week of this month. Shrove & Co., the silver
smiths, have completed two more trophies from original de
to finish better than third In any one of
the four heats paced Tuesday. The Maid
ulso established a new world's record for
four-year-old mares when she paced the
fifth heat of the race in 2:05? i. The best
previous record was 2:06%. made by The
Maid at Cleveland last week.
Thf 2:04 pace, despite the fast time, was
won by Searchlight apparently without an
effort. The gelding is undoubtedly the
fastest pacer out this season, and he. was
almost a prohibitive favorite in the bet
ting. His performance in the first heat
was nothing short of sensational. There
were six startersâ Bessie Bonehill. Ana-
Frank Bogash, Searchlight, Di
rectly and Chehalis. Anaconda took the
lead at the start, and it was evident that
McHenrv proposed to force McCarthy tc
drlvt Searchlight out, for Anaconda wont
the flrsi quarter at almost a two-minute
gait Searchlight moved up slowly, and If
was a pretty race all the way to the
three-quarters, with the horses neck and
neck after they passed the half and Di
rectly Close behind. As the horses came
into the stretch Searchlight shot ahead
and held the lead, passing under the wire
two lengths ahead of Anaconda without
being urged. The official time by quarters
was ::tOV 1:01, 1:29% and 2:039 i.
A orotf-st was at once raised against tne
time it bring claimed that the heat was
made in 2:08$. the half being :69% ii
of 1-01 This was the time caught by a
number of horsemen. The official times
indicate that the third quarter was made
seconds, considerably under a two
minute gait. The protest was not regard
ed however, and the quarter of a second
keeps Searchlight in the 2:04 class.
The gelding won the remaining two
heats with as much ease as the first. The
pace was too hot for Chehalis, and, after
staying one heat, he was distanced.
Ace, the horse which showed such speed
in the 2:10 pace on Tuesday, disappointed
his backers in the finish to-day, not being
able to get better than fourth place In
the concluding heats. While Ace was
generally considered a sure winner after
he had taken two heats on Tuesday, there
were a few wise ones who pinned their
faith on The Maid, and they were the
only ones not surprised when the mare
outfooted the Held in three consecutive
heats.
The Queen was favorite in the 2:24 trot
and won the rare easily in straight heats.
Tudor Chimes was heavily backed in the
2:12 trot, but the gelding never had a show
to win. Bonatella took the first heat and
ed back in the next two.
Dr. T^eek taking the second and
Aknka the third. Ronateila won
the next two heats and the race,
being hard pushed in the fourth by Al
toka. The favorite- made a magnificent
ppurt at the finish in the last heat and

PERCENTAGE OF THE TEAMS
NIGHT GAME AT SAN JOSE A
NOVELTY.
Gossip of Managers, Enthusiasts and
Playersâ lnterest in the Sport
Is Now at High Tem
perature.
A general conclave of baseball manag
ers and enthusiasts helped wear out the
pavement on the corner of Stockton and
Market streets yesterday afternoon.
Hank Harris, beaming with smilosâ soft
remembrances of last Saturday and Sun
day; r>oe McGraw, king of the fruit plok :
.rs; Cal Ewlng, who owns the tail end
ers, and Jack Bonnet, foregathered and
discussed the situation.
Ewing and his Dudes were the target
&\aiTING
for most of the chaff, until the Oakland
manager sprung a surprise by announc
ing that he was about to sign Burt Oli
ver as pitcher. "The contract is almost
consummated," said Ewing; "in fact, you
might say it is completed. There is no
need to tell you what Oliver is, as he
has made a great record for himself in
many high-class amateur contents. He
was rated the best amateur on the coast."
In Oli%-er the Oakland manager certainly
has a good man. He pitches a remark
ably speedy ball and has good control of
his delivery. For years he has beon con
nected with both baseball and football.
He is a big man. of great weight and
has remarkable strength. In one game
against tht- University of California he
struck out sixteen men. Ewing will prob
ably not play him on Saturday or Sun
day Of this week, allowing full time for
training and reaching the proper condi
tion.
There will be a novelty in baseball at
San Jose this evening when the San Fran
cisco team will battle with the Prune
Pickers in the first electric light game
played on the coast. Eighteen arc lights
have 1). . n placed on the ground and every
thing that can be dene, to make the ven
ture a success has received the attention
of the promoters. It is very likely that
but six innings will be the limit of play.
Exhibition Imse and distance throwing,
sliding to bases and general baseball an
tics will be features of the evening sport.
If the affair proves successful, Cal
Ewing and Hank Harris will follow in
line and give their respective cities the
same kind of show.
The Wasps have a substantial lead at
present, due in the three straight victo
ries over Santa Cruz. The Senators and
the Lobsters are nip and tuck for second
place, with a good chance of the former
taking place money in the near future.
Sacramento is playing good ball, showing
Improvement every day. The race to-day
carries as much interest as it did a week
ago. Ewing has ordered his men to prac
tice four clrvs a week and instituted a
system of fines that will soon keep the
life bugs moving in the veins of the
Dudes. They practiced at Recreation
J'ark yesterday, to become accustomed to
the grounds. All the teams are being put
to work and a better class of ball should
result from it. The standing of the teams

A FIELD FOR AMERICAN AGRICULTURAL ARTS
* ~T JT T HILE the triumph of American arms
i/\/ and the stories of American valor in
' V w the Philippines arc worthy themes of
* general discussion, there arc other questions in
* connection with the new possessions of the
United States which are worth the asking.
I r hile Americans -without exception are honoring
â * the brave men who fought for their Hag, they
i are ashing at the same time if the loss of life
and sacrifice of treasure have been compensated
in the acquisition of the islands of the southern
* sees. After the fighting is over and the nation
J estimates its loss and gain, one naturally will ask
Q on which side the scale will tip.
The Call has undertaken to obtain definite in
â * formation on this vitally important problem
from those that are best qualified to speak and
to judge, from those that have just returned
* from the Philippines and have had opportunities
Â« not only to tight, but to observe the conditions
which moke or mar the physical prosperity of
a people. Member's of the Oregon Regiment, ir-
T respective of rank. pnz:atcs as well as commis
.* stoned officers, have been interviewed and have
been asked to express their opinions in reference
:o the Philippines, not as a conquest, but as a
* material, labor enriching, wealth producing ac
Â± quisition to the United States.
A scries of pertinent questions was asked of
each soldier that was interviewed, and in what
* follows are the answers. Each soldier was asked
to give Jiis impressions of the size of the popula
tion of the Philippines and to indicate if possi
ble whether or not the people are profitably em
* ployed. A particular effort was made to discover
zvhether or not the islands possess much agricul
tural land and if this land is accessible to Amcr
* -cans and susceptible to American agriculture.

â¢.ere is no reason why it should not

PRIVATE J. VV. COTTINGEN, Com
,m of the- opinion that the Phil
ippine, judging frim what f saw in the
.>;.-H!'l of Luzon, ore pretty wHI popu
lated While there is plenty of land I
cannot say what the opportunities nre
for getting possession of i: for ;igr:cul
fi:ral purposes, as that is a matter I am
entirely unfamiliar with. A groat variety
of crops can be raised there undoubtedly.
Corn is produced in large quantities. asÂ»
are other cereal?. Up in the foothills is
a great grazing country, and big herds of
rattle an.t hog's are raised. Americans
cannot work thereâ that is. out of doors.
All the hard work is done by the Chinese
rooljos and the natives. T think our labor
ligi.t be enforced there to advan
tage. Of course the Americans cannot
iinese under the pres
ent contract-labor system. The climate is
very enervating to Europeans and Ameri
cana, who cannot live there unless they
exercise care in their manner of living
and refrain from undue exertion. There 1b
no doubt, in my opinion, that the Filipinos
ance to most Americans who think they see in the
Philippines a new field for industry and wealth.
Care was taken also in the queries to learn
whether or not Americans can labor in the
Philippines, and- if not, what people can. A
series of valuable answers zvas received to the
inquiry in reference to the effect of the climate
upon American energy. The advantage or dis
advantage of giving to the natives of the Philip
pines the rights of American citizenship and
of introducing and enforcing American labor
laws on the islands was also discussed.
The anszvers of the Oregon troops to these
questions constitute information of extremely
great value. Most of the troops believe that the
land of the Philippines is well adapted for
American agriculture with the exception of the
cultivation of wheat. This opinion might give
rise to an optimistic view of the situation, but
the soldiers add in the same breath that nearly
all of the agricultural land, and certainly the
best of it, is in the possession of the church au
thorities. It is probable, therefore, since agricul
turists must buy the land, they would prefer to
buy in a locality a little nearer home than the
Philippines.
The soldiers of Oregon are almost to a man
in emphatic opposition even to the suggestion of
making the natives of the Philippines citizens of
the United States, although the opinion seems to
prevail that American labor laws could advan
tageously be put in operation on the islands. As
for Americans working in the Philippines, the
soldiers declare that it is utterly out of the ques
tion. The heat is too intense and the climate
generally too enervating. The Philippines arc the
last lands on the earth for poor men to seek
with a purpose of improving their condition.
The discussion of these interesting questions zvill
be found in detail in the following interviews.

an Intelligent race, and if given a chance
will soon prove themselves capable of
governing themselves.
PRIVATE D. W. HOLGATE, Company
Aâ The Philippines are well populated or
at* least the island of Luzon is. There Is
a lot of land there which is owned by i
wealthy Filipinos, Spaniards and the
church and is rented or leased in small
tracts to the Chinese and poorer natives,
who plant and raise the crops. What the
opportunities now are for obtaining land
for agricultural purposes by Americans !
I do not know, but I do not think it would
be possible to obtain any at this time. So I
far as hard work is concerned, Americans
could not stand it for a moment. All the
work in the fields is done by the Chinese
and the natives. If the present contract
labor system could be abolished and our ;
own labor laws enforced I think the isl- ;
ands could be made a source of profit to
the United States. The climate is ener- !
vating and Impairs the energies of peo- i
pie of our race. I am in favor of admit-Â»
ting the Filipinos to the privileges of Am
erican citizenship. They are intelligent â¢
and observing and far superior to other
Oriental races.
PRTVATE J. N. MITCHELL. Company
A There Is no lack of population In the
Philippines so far as my observation
wÂ«nt. The country districts do not appear
to be thickly Fettled, but there are a great
number of cities ranging from lo.oou to 40,
--rw> population scattered throughout the
island of Luzon, and the fact that the
land is largely In the hands of the church
is one of the principal reasons why oppor
tunities. are poor for obtaining it for ag
ricultural purposes. Good crops can tin
doubtedly be raised there, especially corn,
hemp, tobacco, rice and sugar. I have no j
doubt that wheat and other cereaVs can
also be successfully raised, although I
do not think those crops are raised in I
quantities at present. Americans cannot
labor there at any kind of out-of-door '
work. The cultivation of the fields is en- !
tirely in the hands of the Chinese and the ;
natives, chiefly the former. The islands
could probably be made profitable to this
country if our labor laws were substi
tuted for the present contract system, but
the climate is not suited to people of our ;
race. It is too enervating, and a -short
residence in the islands impairs the en- I
ergy of the most robust. The Filipinos;
are a much superior people to the Japa
nese, with whom they are often com-;
pared. They are more intelligent and far
more moral. They are extremely anxious
to familiarize themselves with the Amer
ican language and everything else Amer
lean. 1 think they would make good
citizens and fim in favor of their being
accorded equal privileges with the rest of i
us.
PRIVATE W. A. MELLINGER. Com
pany Aâ They do not need any more peo- >
pie in ih>- Philippines, as the country is ;
pretty well populated as it is. 1 do not
think the opportunities tor. obtaining U.id i
for agricultural purposes at the present
time are very good. Most of the land is
owned by the church and hard to get :iold
of for that reason. I think American
agriculture can be introduced there, sucn
as raising wheat, corn, barley, oats, rye,
etc., and raising cattle and hogÂ«. In j
fact, a great deal of corn is already- raised

All land titles are badly tangled, but they
will probably be straightened out after
the fighting is over. A great deal. of corn
is raised there and other cereals can also
be raised, I should judge, although I am
doubtful about wheat, which I am afraid
would sprout before it could ripen on ac
count of the heat. Cattle and hogs are
raised in great numbers, as there Is con
siderable fine grazing land in the foot
hills. White men could never work there
successfully In the agricultural districts.
They could not stand the climate, and
even if they could they would starve to
death, as they could not compete with
the Chinese coolies and the natives, who
do all the hard work in the islands. I
do not think the islands could be made i
profitable to the United States if the
contract system was abolished and our
labor laws enforced there, for the reason
that wages are altogether too low and
must necessarily continue so where there
is so much Chinese and cheap native la

the heavy work in Manila, but the Fil- j

âThe Philippines are pretty well popu
lated, as far as I had opportunities of
judging. I don't know what the oppor
tunities for gettfng land for agricultural
purposes are. They raise a good number
of cattle in the foothills and great quan
tities of corn. I suppose other crops, such
as wheat, barley, etc., would also thrive.
It would be impossible for Americans to
labor there, as they could not stand the
climate. All the work in the fields is
done by the Chinese coolies and the na
tive Filipinos. The country never could
be made profitable under our system of
labor laws, and as to the natives be
ing entitled to citizenship, that is absurd.
They are worse than our Indians.

THE RETURN OF ThjE VOLUNTEERS.
LAST year the volunteers from our own State, I
Idaho, Oregon, Washington, Montana, Wyo
ming, lowa, Pennsylvania and Tennessee, and
the Astor Battery from New York, sailed away seven j
;and miles to battle.
They reached San Francisco fresh from their homes,
in the flash of health and filled with zeal to do their
duty by their country. The issues of war were then
uncertain. Dewey had shown the weakness of Spain
at sea. But what could she do on land? In our last
war with Great Britain we won constantly at sea, but
h ist as regularly in every land battle, until Jackson j
met Pakenham at New Orleans and won a victory
after peace had been declared. England was then the
invader of our soil, and these young soldiers were
going to invade Spanish territory in a land of ro
mance, glamour and mystery.
They marched like heroes, and as the transports that
bore them away dropped gradually out of sight, hull i
i, and finally topmast hidden behind the great |
curve of this big world, hearts ached and eyes flowed '
tears, afloat and ashore.
Now the big transports bring them back, thousands
of them living and a thousand of them dead. No
army ever has faced such difficulties as they have i
found in the unexpected war which held them on â 
the other side of the eartti, after the legal expiration
of their enlistment and the accomplishment of its ob
ject in the overthrow of Spain. They have sweltered
in camp and boiled in the trenches. They have rushed :
through muddy swamps against the longer range guns
of the enemy to get within the striking distance of ,
their less effective arms. They have obeyed every
order, except one to retreat. Placed in a novel situa
tion from a military point of view, called to a kind of
fighting in which tactics were useless, each man his
been his own captain and general officer. The im
portance of individual initiative, which is the peculiar
of the American volunteer, was never as well
shown as in the hard campaigns which have changed
these fair-faced boys into bronzed and seasoned vet
erans.
Their duty was the hardest ever taken by American
soldiers. We have on our pension roll yet nearly a
score of people who draw for service rendered in our i
revolution of i""6, a war begun a century and a quar
ter ago, and the same roll bears the names of those j
pensioned in every war since. But from Concord to \
Santiago, no troops under our flag and fighting for
it have ever faced such a task, in such a territory,
against such an enemy and under such climatic ter
rors, as the^e young veterans who are with us now and !
are going home.
They have in all things acquitted themselves like
men and soldiers. Not forgetting that they were citi- !
zens of the republic, they have not forgotten that they
were soldiers of the fatherland.
The chapter in which history records human cour- i
ape has been doubled by their deeds. The soldier's â <
story, continued from one hard war to another, frcn
Marathon to Manila, under all suns, and all com- j
manders, has gained a thrill from their sacrifices, and I
when it is all over, and there is no further call for !
hard death in hard fighting far away* from the homes
that have to mourn, they must be gallant men and j
that cause great that can sustain the interest of the
Story at the heignt to which these volunteers have car
ried it. California cheered their going as she- does '
their return. The Golden Gate is the wide way by
which they enter God's country. May they return to
its sympathy and support, its opportunity open in civil
life, to home circles unbroken and home hearts made
fonder by absence and its perils.
The Oaklander, whÂ« is being sued for divorce lie

PHILIPPINE PHYSIOGRAPHY.
THE people of this country have but a passing
and temporary interest in the military person
alities arising from the Philippine campaign
Accepting the declaration of Colonel Denby that if
we want the Philippines we want them as an asset, a
piece of property of value to the American people, it
is in order to secure as much information as possible
bearing upon the asset and property which we are
seeking to secure by costly military operations.
It has been widely published that the Philippines
offer splendid opportunities to the American home
seeker and that an American from Florida or Maine
can go there confident that the climate will not impair
his energies nor work the physical degeneracy of hU
children. If this is true it settles the matter.
If the arable kinds are open to homestead
settlement, or to acquisition at a figure not repugnant
i to American ideas of their productive value, and the
population is sparse and the climate agreeable, our
people may go there safely, with the assurance that
unimpaired American energy and thrift will get their
reward.
If these conditions are present there will soon be
worked a great change in the history of tropical
economics. The people in all tropical countries have
always been poor, measured by the temperate zone
standard of wealth and comfort. The wealth of the
world has always been in the temperate zone. Tropi
cal labor has always been slave or servile labor in
some form, and where the social foundation is Com
posed of non-assimilable servile labor there is but lit
tle progress and a faulty civilization. All this is to be
reversed if Americans can work in the Philippines as
they work here, and if the population is not already
crowded and lands are open to settlement.
The Call to-day publishes interviews with the Ore
gon volunteers bearing upon these physical facts. The
answers are to a few set questions, and while they
differ in an estimate of. the character of the Filipinos,
they are practically unanimous as to the physical
facts. They agree that the climate is not suited to our
people and that Americans cannot work there. Even
the Filipinos avoid labor as much as possible and
the most of the field and other hard work is performed
by Chinese coolies. If Americans escape the acute
diseases which are endemic there, these volunteers
agree that a year's residence in that hot and humid
climate saps "their energy and undermines their
strength. The common answer is "No place for a
white man." As to the ownership of land, there is
general agreement that the custom, which began with
the extension of Spanish power around the world,
was followed in those islands. . Spain sent out two
classes â soldiers and churchmen. The soldiers paid
no attention to production. They made conquests
and held them. The church orders, composed of skill
ful men, well informed, gave their attention to the
productions of the country and the conversion of the
people. In this way it occurred that in all the Span
ish colonies the church and church orders owned the
land. Indeed, this custom was not confined to Spain,
for such ownership of land was common on the
European continent and in England.
In the Philippines what the church does not own is
taken up by foreign syndicates, principally British.
On all the land Chinese is the principal labor em-
ployed.
Anglo-Saxons do not like to be tenants. The pride
of ownership is upon them, and not many Americans,
even if climatic conditions were agreeable, would seek
the Philippines to become tenants of the church or of
British syndicates. Just what our Government will do
with the land question remains to be seen. In all of
the Spanish colonies in this hemisphere the church
property was confiscated as soon as they became in
dependent, and we believe that was part of Agui
naldo's programme in the Philippines, which our con
quest of the islands will prevent". The future must de
velop our policy. The church property in England
was confiscated by Henry VIII. The first appearance
in history of the trust, which is a political issue now in
this country, was the effort made by the church to
save its lands by putting them in trust, in the hands
of a combination of laymen.
In the Philippines this country can follow up con
quest by wiping out all land titles and declaring the
land public domain, open to acquisition by all citizeas;
or it may respect all such titles and bar private owner
ship of the only lands there that are fit for tillage.
The present owners will greatly benefit by our mili
tary occupation of the country and the order which
will be enforced by the presence of garrisons.
It is to b^ hoped that the American press will give
to the "people the information brought home by the
volunteers. They are intelligent men who have had
the benefit of a year's observation and much practical
experience in that climate. As will be seen by the
answers we publish to-day, the volunteers are mostly
drawn from farm life and show a fine knowledge of
its requirements. What they say about such life in
the Philippines may be depended upon as reliable.
An oil exchange has been established to boom the
trade in the State. The Southern Pacific Company
generously provided some of its deluded passengers
the other day with a special train consisting of an
engine and an oil car. There is no necessary connec
tion between the two facts, but Uncle Collis is an
adept at cheap advertising.
Principal McXaughton of the San Jose Normal
School must rather enjoy the investigation which is
now being made of his character. His .critics have
been after him for nine years and he seems to find no
monotony in the proceedings.
DEMOCRATIC TRANSFORMATIONS.
SOME months ago Henry Watterson, who is a
man of strong intellect and independent char
acter, published a letter, probably in the Cou
rier-Journal of Louisville, entitled "What Shall the
Party Do to Be Saved?" It was, of course, the Demo
: cratic party to which he referred, and, after proving
| incontestably its abandonment of principle in the so-
I cialistic Chicago platform,, his conclusion was that
! its salvation' depended upon its return to its own
characteristic doctrines and the selection of a new
; candidate for the Presidency in 1900.
If Mr. Watterson was correct, then as his advice has
'â  been wholly disregarded, the Democratic party is
doomed to defeat, if not extinction, in the coming na
tional campaign. But in fact its doom had been sealed
before he wrote. The election of 1896 was a complete
Republican victory. The State elections of 1898, how
ever, even more definitely settled the fate of free sil
ver at 16 to I or at any ratio incompatible with it*
bullion value, and. coupled with almost simultaneous
, action throughout the world, including Japan and sev
eral of the South American republics, and recently
followed by the virtual restoration or substitution of
: the gold standard in India, for years at feast closed
the record of bimetallism, even in a form that would
r.ot have been unacceptable to a large number of
American Republicans.
These State elections also arrested the rising tide

[practicalized socialism, that sought to substitute gov

ernment by changeable majorities for the constitu
tional government established by the founders of the
republic, in which the rights of individuals and of mi
norities were protected. On June 24, 1778, Alexan
der Hamilton, representing the ideas of the Federal
or Conservative party that afterward became the in
heritance of the Whigs, and anticipating the pre
dominant features of the national constitution as sub
sequently framed and adopted, identified State
autonomy and freedom in the following language:
"The States can never lose their power till the whole
people of America are robbed of their liberties." He
wns arguing for the Federal Senate, as it was framed
and has always existed, on the ground that it would
preserve the individuality of the States as members
of the Union. While the system of biennial elections
of Representatives by direct vote in Congressional
districts insured the constant impression of popular
opinions upon Congress, it was believed that the
longer terms of Senators and their direct, relation to
the States were effective guarantees against centraliza
tion on the one hand and rash legislation on the other.
That a change in the mode of electing Federal Sena
tors by the transfer of the power of choosing them
from the Legislatures to the people is in progress is
an incontestable fact. For years it has been alleged,
to some extent unjustly, that the upper house of
Congress has become a plutocratic club. It is certain
that scats in that body have been purchased, as even
Boss Buckley acknowledges. The spectacles in Cali
fornia, Pennsylvania and other States during the pres
ent year, and in which both parties were implicated,
have added strong impetus to the movement. Such
offensive exhibitions of corruption have accumulated
for a generation, until their stench became intolerable,
and relief a necessity.
But the deference to popular sovereignty implied in
its direct exercise by the people in the selection of
Senators does not necessarily involve any revolution in
the constitutional functions of the Senate of the
United States. On the contrary, it is expected to re
store that illustrious body to its ancient foundation.
It is the mode and not the result of election that is to
be altered. When the Federal constitution has been
amended, as in all our previous history, Senators will
represent their respective States as well as the Union.
The question applies to means and not to ends.
The transformations and the exchanges of parties
are" among the curious episodes of modern times. It
has been seen that, even prior to the formal estab
lishment of the Government, the leader of the con
servative political element in the country, accused
indeed of aristocratic proclivities, firmly believed in
the preservation of State autonomy. Thomas Jeffer
son, the actual founder of the Democratic party, car
ried this fundamental proposition to its furthest pos
sible limts. There was one great conception, there
fore, upon which both parties were practically united.
State rights were the slogan of the Democrats, and
out of an extreme development of this doctrine the se
cession faith originated.
The Chicago platform and the fusion platforms of
last year abandoned every principle that had made
Democracy respectable and, down to 1861, with brief
interruptions, had retained for it the control of the
Government. The socialistic theories that have been
substituted for the Democracy of Jefferson, strongly
indorsed on the point here more immediately con
sidered by Hamilton and to which Mr. Watterson
sagaciously desired his party to return, obliterate in
effect not only State lines, but county and municipal
divisions, and propose to weld the entire population
of the United States into a huge and unwieldy mass
of human beings, provided for by paternalism, if
these theories should ever be practicaiized, individual
ism would be lost and humanity reduced to the level
of an automatic machine.
The fusion Democracy has yielded up the ghost of
Jeffersonian Democracy. Its vitality is gone. What
ever elements the Democratic party ever possessed
that harmonized with our political system and guarded
life, liberty and property have been appropriated by
the Republican party, which stands for State rights,
subject to the integrity of the Union, and to the main
tenance and fulfillment of every constitutional obliga
tion. Former political attitudes have been reversed.
The doctrines of corrupt, offensive and injurious cap
italization, as distinguished from the just use of the
legal power of combination and accumulation, are in
their essence the substance of fusion Democracy.
The fusionists are in a sorry plight. The Exam
iner, with its national and internal policies, inconsist
ent in themselves and contradicted in practice, is their
appropriate organ. But noise and froth and constant
repudiation of Americanism are their only capital.
They are fussy but harmless. When Zechariah ob
served the horses red, speckled and white, he asked
a visiting angel: "What are these?" and a man replied:
"These are they whom the Lord has sent to walk to
and fro through the earth." And then the men who
rode the horses added: "We have walked to and fro
through the earth, and behold all the earth sitteth still
and is at rest."
The fusion Democrats belong to the age of Zecha
riah and not to the nineteenth century.
Washington statesmen are beginning to disturb
themselves seriously in an effort to determine how
the Filipino war will affect politics. They might dis
cuss with better profit the query of how politics will
affect the Filipino war.
The press censor at Manila must be away on a vaca
tion. Through some strange oversight of the authori
ties the correspondents were permitted to report an
act of exceptional heroism on the part of a Filipino
officer.
The Trustees of the State Normal School at San
Jose have applied the whitewash brush to Principal
McNaughton. Many of the alumni are still of the
opinion that the doctor should have had the boot.
The great railroad strike at Cleveland seems to
have reached a very happy stage if not a conclusion.
Each side claims a victory, neither is willing to trust
itself and both are afraid of each other.
As the Democratic National Committee is com
plaining of a lack of money, it is clear the people are
too prosperous to care very much whether the old
calamity mill is kept running or not.
And now the subordinates of the national naval
bureaus have been talking too much. The authorities
af Washington ought to make a requisition for some
deaf r.nd dumb clerks.
Peace hath her victories as well as war. Sir Julian
Pauncefote, it is announced, is soon to be elevated
to the British peerage in recognition of his services
at The Hague congress.
The Cubans are about to send a deputation to
Washington to ask our intentions, so now if Uncle
Sam meajis to wed the Queen of the Antilles it is time
for him to say so.

Â,.<;. ' . (j>+ It had been some
' . *;.;.'â¢ time since they
had gathered. The Spanish war had called
for their services in one way and another,
and many a strange scene had been wit
nessed and many curious episodes enacted
since last they were together.
"You may put a little red pepper in
mine this time, Charlie," said Bruguiere.
"Ever since I made that transport trip to
Manila my lower hold f eel 3 â¢ a little
draughty unless I put a cargo of pepper
aboard to warm it up a bit. By the way,
McGregor, did you do any soldier carry
ing during the war?" "
"No," replied the gentleman with the
mahogany countenance seated at the
weather side of the table. "I went looking
for whales, and carried nothing but dry
casks and an insurance' policy. That was
so heavy that I nearly turned turtle."
"Well, m' bucko, if you want an experi
ence that will turn your hair gray be

unless it is a cattle ship with the pens

"We had all sorts of trouble going down
last summer. The men were not used to
the sea. Neither were their officers, and
the result was that the ship looked more
like a barn in distress than a respectable
eea-golng craft. The deck got so thick
with grease that we tried it out afterward
and made double our wages by selling the
proceeds to a candle firm. "We used to
have out the wind-catchers at our port
holes, and the men on deck utilized them
as receptacles for the stale beans they
threw over the side.
"The officers were worse than the men,
and altogether it was the. ship's
company that you ever saw. One night
the captain, after remonstrating with the
colonel on the laxity of discipline, went
forward to speak to the men himself. He
carried a lighted cigar in his mouth. Just
a/5 he stepped off the break of the poop
some one soaked him with a wet pillow
and drove .the weed half-way down his
throat. He never said a word, but, turn
ing on his heel, entered his cabin. A few
minutes afterward he sent for me and
said: 'Sir, I have bet;n in command for

from a scow to a three-skysail-yarder,
and this is the first time such a thing has
happened to me. I can't clean out that

and I saw the door close. "When we ar

MILLIONS WORTH OF TIDE
LANDS IN LITIGATION
IT INVOLVES VALUABLE OAK-
LAND ESTUARY FRONTAGE.
Mary Gwin Claims to Be the Successor
of Original Grantee and Demands
a United States Patent for
the Property.
A petition involving the title to several
million dollars of tide land property on
the San Antonio Creek, the Oakland es
tuary and other places in Alameda County
has been presented to L 7 nited States Dis
trict Judge de Haven, and will be argued
before him on Monday. September 4.
The petition is from Mary E. H. Gwin, as
intervenor, and asks that the Secretary
of the Interior be instructed to issue a
patent to her for the lands of the Rancho
de San Antonio, better known as the
Peralta grant.
The averments of the petition are that
in January. 1852, Antonio, Vicente, Ignacio
and Dominico Peralta filed a claim for
the lands mentioned before the United
States Land Commissioners. The Com
missioners and the United States District
Court conlirmed the validity of the claim
of the petitioners on January 26, 1555. In
1556 the United States Supreme Court con
firmed the validity of the grant and the
claim of the petitioners and remanded the
case to the United States District Court
for further proceedings. The District
Court on November 30, 1559, amended its
decree to conform to the decision of the
Supreme Court of the United States. In
1566 Congress passed an act that in the
event that no survey of the grant had
been requested before the passage of the
act nor within ten months after its pass
age the Surveyor General of the United
States was authorized to survey the grant
in conformity with the decree.
The petitioners had not asked before the
passage of the act or within ten months
after its passage for a survey, and in 1895
the Surveyor General surveyed the grant
and approved the plat of survey. In
the petition Gwin and Francisco San
Jurjo (since deceased) asked the Com
missioner of the General Land Office for
a patent of the grant, but the Commis
sioner refused. The Secretary of the In
ttrior confirmed the decision of the Com
missioner and refused to issue the patent
Boyd & Fifield appear for the petitioner
who claims to have succeeded to the title
from the original grantees.
Mr. Boyd said last night that the San
Antonio ranch was granted by Mexico to
the United States as a part of its Cali
fornia concession. By some oversight or
mistake when the matter was brought
Into the United States Court squatters
were allowed to come in to raise a
contention as to the location of the
boundaries of the grant, and the
United States undertook to confirm
and make valid to the grantees of
the Mexican Government all the land
which Mexico had granted to them. But
as there could be but one owner of the
property, it was not possible for the Mex
ican grantee and the State of California
to own the same property. The United
States compelled the Mexican grantee
Antonio Peralta. to submit his title to
the United States Court for examination
and the court agreed that the grant of
land was his.
In forcing Peralta into that tribunal the
United States assumed the attitude of an
ordinary litigant and abdicated its sov
ereign right of exemption from suits and
the effects of judgments or decrees
Mr. Boyd, in reply to a question, admit
ted that it was barely possible that other
lands might be Involved in the matter
.and. that there were adverse claimants.
LATEST STORIES
of the
FUNNY MAN.
Not Bound by Notions.
One member of our local theatrical col
ony tells this story on himself: He was
spending the summer in a suburban town,
and as he is an exceedingly fastidious
person he found It somewhat difficult to
find quarters quite to his liking. He went
one day to look at rooms in a house on
the Tennallytown road. The landlady
seemed not at all impressed by his per
sonality.
"My name is So-and-So," he said.
"Are you in office?" she asked.
"Certainly not, madame," he replied,
with dignity. "I am a professional. I am
an actor, madame."
"Oh, well," she answered, cheerfully,
"that wouldn't make no difference if you
paid in advance. I ain't got no old-fash
ioned prejudices."â Washington Post.
An Unnecessary Explanation.
He was describing a holdup in which he
had played the star part.
"Yes, he said, "the biggest ruffian held
me so tightly against the brick wall that
I could feel the mortar scratching my
backbone. 'Gimme your watch!' he
growled. I gave it to him immediately."
. There was a pause.
"Gave it right up, eh?" said a breath
less listener.
"Yes." said the victim, "I did." Then he
dreamily added: "You see, I was pressed
for time." â Cleveland Plain Dealer.
He Uttered the Sesame.
The late Senator Sessions of New York
was a clerical looking man, always wear
ing an immaculate white cravat, but his
appearance was in some respects decep
tive. The will of Stephen Girard provided
that no clergyman should ever be al
lowed to enter Girard College at Philadel
phia. One day Mr. Sessions approached
the entrance.
"You can't come in here," said the jani
tor.
"The I can't!" said the stranger.
"Oh." said the janitor, "excuse me."
Step right in."â San Francisco Argonaut.
The Joke on Splints.
" Awfully good joke on young Splints,
fsnt it?"
"Didn't hear it."
"He si_zed a man up for appendicitis
and favored him with n hasty operation."
"What's the joke? Man dead?"
"Man's dead all right enough, but tint
ain't the joke. They found out at the
autopsy that he was born without any
appendix. How's that?" â Cleveland Plain
Dealer.

PLANTS" IN SLEEPING ~ROOMS-^
Flora, Napa, Cal. The general effect of
plants is to purify the air. The leaves
I of plants and trees inhale carbonic acid
gas, the poisonous element of the atmo
sphere thrown out by anlm ils in breath
ing, and give out oxygen, the life-giving
element, without which animal life cannot
exist. The constant action of the leaves
! is one of the natural agencies by which
the proportion of carbonic acid gas is kept
at a minimum. Carbonic acid, without
which plant life could not exist, is poison
ous to animal lifeâ not. as is usually sup
posed, because it is Itself a poison, but
because when more than a certain pro
portion of it is in the air respiration is
I impossible. It is not a poison to the
stomach or blood, but is deadly to the
lungs. House plants should never be kent
in sleeping rooms, nor. Indeed, in any
rooms generally occupied, if the matter
of ventilation Is not attended to very
carefully. Every green leaf on tree or
plant sucks in during the sunshine car
bonic acid from the air and breathes out
oxygen but this only in the day time
During the night this action ceases and
.the reverse takes placeâ that is taking in
oxygen and throwing out carbonic acid
The young shoots and flowers of all plants
breathe in oxygen only: consequently they
may actually vitiate the air. just ani
mals do, by increasing the proportion of
carbonic acid. From this it ma b noted
that harm done by plants in houses is

Republicans are making commpnda

ntion. In several districts the dif
es within the party have been
and in each <>f the districts
where the negotiations f"r harmony

was asserted last night by one _>f the

Republicans in the Thirtieth. Fortieth,
Forty-first, Forty-second, Forty-third
and Forty-fifth Assembly districts had

inty Committee does not go
nd the limit of suggestion in deal
. â  ious districts.
The City Republican League, of
tvhich Henry T. Scott is president, does
not assume to dictate elegate nomina
tions to the listrict clubs organized
under the auspices of the league, but
.has exerted influence iv the line of sug
gestiun to induce the selection of a good
class of nominees. Men of large affairs,
who have the great.. interests at
s-take, are extremely reticent in allotv
ing their names to be^ placed on a dele
gate ticket, yet the indications are that
the Republican Municipal Convention
will be representative of the character
and intelligence of San Francisco.
The Democrats do not appear to be
making any urtusual effort to bring for
ward prominent men to be voted for as
delegates. The Buckley faction is Look
ing for men who will be loyal to the
old boss. The Rain.ey-Examin.-r league
is taking anybody who will agree to
serve Rainey and protect the Fire De
partment. Behind the following the
nlner hopes to set in and control
I'helan, should he be re-elected Mayor.
The Democratic faction which acknowl
edges allegiance to Jasper McDonald
and Gavin McNab's committee of one
hundred promised to introduce some
elements of respectability into the con
vention of the Democratic party, but
in order to gain votes in the several
districts the faction has succumbed to
the demands of job-chasers and put
forward a list <.f men known only to
the city- -directory and great register.
The Republicans are far in advance of
ihe Democrats in recognizing that citi
zens of known character and standing
in the community should be called to
the duty of nominating men to fill the
municipal offli under the new charter.
The City Republican League at its
headquarters in the Grand Hotel- last
night practically finished its work of
naming district tickets. Many good
men have been proposed for service in
the nominating convention.
In the Twenty-ninth Assembly Dis
trict the Rainey-Examiner League and
Buckley have 'joined hands to down
Samuel Braunhart, who is the exponent
of the qprnmittee of One Hundred in
that political subdivision of the city.
&ite last Tuesday night Braunhart
lied the district with small posters
Snouncing his delegate ticket. Among ,
the display lnes of the poster, above
the names of the proposed delegates,
Mere these:
PLEDGED TO PHEL.AN

TXCONTROLLED BY CORRUPT
BOSSES!
Before daylight yesterday morning
the Ralneyites, Examinerites and Buck
leyites caught sight of the Braunhart
posters and forthwith had pink slips
best - known men in Chicago . and
throughout the State of Ohio. He was
for years president of the American }
Cereal Company, a position which he i
resigned en the Bth of February. He

that he mipht straighten out his affairs

where he has resided ever since.
The bride is a handsome blonde, and I
at the license office gave her age as j
forty, but she looks nearer twenty-five, j
When seen last night at his apart- â

said: "Now that the story of my mar
riage with Miss Zipperlen is out I have
no objection to saying a few words
with reference to it. She is much
younger than I, 'tis true, but I love j
her and she loves me. Don't you,
dear?"
This to the bride, who was in an ad
joining room. "Miss Zipperlen's fam- I
fly knew when she started from homo '
that the tour which she was about to
take would end in matrimony."

printed and pasted over the Braunhart
display lines. The pasters contained
these wards:
THIS TICKET IS CONTROLLED BY
BOSS SAM BRAUNHART.
At the bottom of the Braunhart
poster is this note of caution:
WARNING.
All good citizens are warned
against the machinations of those fol
lowers of the criminal bosses, who
hide their treachery to the Demo
cratic party and their hostility to de
cency in politics under the cloak of
Mayor Phelan's popularity, whose
labors for improved conditions they
have always belittled and vainly
sought /to discourage, and whose
election to the Mayoralty they have
attempted to defeat in two elections
by most despicable means.
These words of warning were not mo
lested by the agents of Buckley, Ftainey
and the Examiner. The Phelan battle
cry is used by all the corrupt factions
of the Democratic party, hence it serves
boss as well as another.
There has been a large importation
of rounders and stuffers for service In
the Twenty-ninth District on the day of
the primary election. It is claimed by
the Braunhart faction that the stuffers
have been imported to help Buckley
and Rainey.

trict clubs throughout the city and county

district organization of the Republican
party of this city and -county, the term

lowing the date of their election, and their
duty was to harmonize the Republican
clubs of tlv- several districts and consult
with the leaders <if said district clubs for
the welfare ami interest of the Republican
party.' 1 Mr. Raisch, on concluding these
remarks, stated that the election of a
temporary chairman was in order, and
Horace Jackson urnse and placed Colonel
T. V. Eddy in nomination. Samu'l Bar
man seconded the nomination. Colonel
Eddy was the unanimous choice .of :he
members, and he took the chair. In ac
cepting the honor he said: "I suppose
that r>n an occasion of this kind speech
making is entirely out of order. We have
work to do. I would like to say on my
own behalf that I appreciate the honor
of my We are on the threshold
of an important campaign ajid we are
Inclined to believe that this departure
from thf old rules that have obtained in
the past is a very wise one. We have a
â  on our hands of the very greatest
importance, and T assure you, gentlemen,
that T will do all I can to forward your

When the applause had subsided Sen

OTR COMMERCIAL STATUS. /
The New York circular of Henry Clews
â â¢The general business situation Is highly
promisintf. Near all the principal indus
tries arÂ» actively employed, and the iron trade
is experiencing a boom beyond all precedent.
An Ktraordlnary fact is the comparative ab
sence of speculation. Our mills ar- crowded
with orders for goods that are wanted -for
actual consumption; and for once in history
at least the speculator hns failed to anticipate
future wants. Another striking feature la the
uniform belief that we are to have one or
two years of prosperity like the present with
l-.ttle interruption. The world, and- especially
tne United States, â¢> recovering several years
of retarded growth with a rush. In about a
year, 1 iwever, production will have partlallv
caught up w:th consumption, and we may
then expect lomi abatement of activity. The
numerous advau in wages and the starting
of new enterprises will suffice to carry us
along foi a ionslderable period. Crop proe
pects p.re not unfavorable. There Is every
livelihood of our having an average amount
of wheat for home and foreign consumption,
with prospects of a good demand on the lat
ter account Corn promises well. Railroad
earnings show very handsome gains. The
Planters r.re carrying enormous quantities
oi s-air.. aj-.rt the great revival in industrial
a-ul commercial activity materially swells
thÂ°ir revenue. The political future contains
n-.anv perplexing questions, but they are not
of the sort that will seriously affect business.
."EiUtbound ments this week were 12'VK)i
tons as against 47,000 tons for the correspond
ing V-'-ek nf last year. This is what is back
ing the stock market, as it is a most poten
tial legitima:e factor on the bull side; it n
this kind o' prosperity which makes the vo
cation of the bears >n railroad shares an un
table occupation at the present time."

EASTERN MARKETS
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. Aug. 2.â To-day's stock market, j
like that of yesterday, had a period of strength \
In the morning which gave way before the day j
was over. The depression was due to the con- j
tinued prospect of hard money. The early
strength had its Inception In the disposition j
if London to -buy American stocks notwith- ;
standing the marking up. of the money rate
there. The demand from London was especially j
marked for Atchison preferred, Louisville and
Nashville and Northern Pacific. London sold
Anaconda Copper and there was a smart up
ivard movement In some of the specialties.
Early in the day Sugar wer.t up 2> 4 . Reports
Of the extraordinary earnings In the iron and
steel Industry gave a firm tone to that group
of stocks and .Tennessee Coal had the addi
tional benefit of a report that valuable prop
erty was about to be acquired and that claims
of preferred stockholders were In process of
adjustment. The stock in consequence rose
354. The trunk lines were favorably ' affected
by the going into effec/t of the higher freight I
rates on grain to the seaboard. The Tobacco
storks, the local traction shares, General Elec
tric, Cotton Oil, People'S Gas and a few others
<aine.| from individual causes. The general
appearance of Btrength thus imparted to the |
market prompted some covering by the shorts j
who sold yesterday, thus helping on the ad- 1
vance. The higher prices brought out realiz- J
ing sales and there was a sharp break in Sugar
and Brooklyn Transit, the latter dropping 2' 2
from the best. Lackawanna suddenly fell
away 32 points on rumors of a projected strike.
The grangers were weak on bad crop news.
The closing was dull and heavy, generally be
low last night's closing. The apprehension
ver th< money outlook was caused by the ad
vance of discount rates in London to a point i
above the Bank of England's rate. The fall |
in consols was evidence that the Bank of
England waa again borrowing from the mar- |
ket to repel the demana for gold made probable
by the recent downward course of sterling ex
change In New York. There waa not enough !
doing in sterling exchange here to-day to re
flect the influenre of this move, but the ster- i
ling exchange rate at Berlin, wherice London
continued to draw gold, rose 2 pfennigs. The
bulk of call loans In New York were mad.; ;
fn-<]ay at 4 per cent and lenders showed them
selves Indisposed to renew time loans at cur
rent rate 6. Prime commercial paper rates
ruled from 4 to i per cent. Outside banks |
<-ont!nuer! to draw on their deposits in New
York banks Tor the purpose of making loane In !
this market. There has been some outgo of j
funds from this tenter to Montreal on account j
rif stringency there.
There was activity and strength by the Kan- '
ms City, Pittsburg and Gulf firsts. Otherwise
the bond market was irregular. Total sales,
$2,009,500.
United States T.s declined '* in the bid price.

WHEAT AND OTHER GRAINS.
WHEATâ opened Flow hut steadier
owing to unexpected steadiness at Liverpool
' and reported damage by hall in thÂ« North
west. The outlook in North Dakota was re
ported not altogether favorable, while the
Washington weekly 'bulletin acknowledged
damage. ' The prospects were for higher val
ues, but the market lacked support. The for
elen cables wÂ«re higher on account of un
favorable weather. .-
Later on it .became apparent that the mar
ket was largeiy oversold and the decline was
perhaps overdone. The feeling became firmer
on heavy clearances .of over half a million
bushels -without New York. The feeling was
unsettled, and each . decline gathered new j
I strength.
The local situation .sympathized with Chi
] cago, and futures recovered somewhat. Spot
prices were unchanged.

HAY AND FEEDSTUFFS.
Receipts of Hay again fell off. ae will be
seen, but it made no difference, as the market
continued weak and dull. Prices stood with- j
out change.
Rolled Barley is lower. Bran and Mid- .
dlings are unchanged.
The circular of Somers A Co. says of Hay:
"Total receipts for the week ending to-day
â how something over 4..-OT. tons, just a- trtnV ;
lees than for the week preceding. This makes
a daily' average of about 700 tons, at which
rate Hay "has been marketed for about the j
last three weeks. * .
"In spite of the prevailing low primps there
is quite a general feeling that prices will bo
still lower consequently th'-re is not the num
ber of consumers tilling their barn-room that
we would ordinarily expect this time of year.
In spite of a somewhat crippled demand Hay
has not dropped during the past week or ten
days as was expected by some. It is true
that the market is very soft and prices some
what lower than were quoted last week, but
we have not noted a heavy drop as was pre
dicted. It is somewhat surprising where all ;
the Hay goes to. but it Is disposed of in one 1
way or another. In such times as these it
does not 'go at all easily, but has to be forced
ott to all available purchasers. Such a con
ditlon of affair? is not healthy, and until mat
ters car. be somewhat equalized, as far as
the supply and demand is concerned, we will
not have a satisfactory market here. ;
â â¢During the last f ew days we have noticed
the general average of hay to be somewhat,
poorer in quality than that which has be-n
marketed previously. This also tends to lower
the tone of the market, while choice quality
X Is t-nd to hold up prices.
â¢â¢With the exception of the very choicest
grades of both Wheat and Oat Hay, prices- are
oft from 2S@sOc per ton from the quotations
of one week ago. Nothing new has developed
in the matter of unlo. ked-for demands or new
markets, and from all indications the San
Francisco market will be overburdened with
.shipments and prices will rule as low as at
present, if not lower, for the next two or
three months to come

DRIED FRUITS, NUTS AND RAISINS.
The market for new fruit is steadily im
proving. Apricots continue the firmest arti
cle in the list, and prices have again ad
vanced a fraction. The crnp Is turning out
smaller than expected. Instead of the 500 cars
anticipated, 300 cars is row the maximum es
timate, "and it is believed that the entire crop
of the Santa Clara Valley will not exceed 50
cars. : "
Evaporated. Apples are temporarily steady,
owing to large engagements for Australia.
The Peach crop. is now estimated at from.
800 to 1000. cars, of which the. San Joaquin
Valley will turnish Â£00 to <>00 and the north
ern part of the State 300 to 500 cars. The mar
ket Is steady and unchanged.
New Prunes cannot LÂ»e bought under 3VÂ»e
for the four sizes, but buyers are unwilling
to meet this figure, -which is an advance over
the preliminary . figures of 1898. Holders are
indifferent, however, owing to the . limited
crop all over the world. .

A DEAD CROOK'S INGRATITUDE
The Widow of the Late Judg-e Camp
bell Wants Possession of a Pair
of Diamond Errings.
Mrs. Eugenia F. Campbell, widow of the
'idge Campbell, who resides on Ash
by avenue, Berkeley, secured a search
i . rant in Judge Mogan'a court yester
day to recover the possession of a pair
of diamond earrings, valued at $125, which
she alleges are in the Nevada Loan Of
flce, 214 Grant avenue.
Shortly before Judge Campbell's death
James Keating, a well-known thieJ and
: husband of Mabel Keating, the plck
' pocket, called ai the Judge's residence to
i bond signed for a friend. Mrs.
Campbell had lost one of the stones from
her diamond earrings and Keating hap
' pened to observe it on the floor and pick
ed It up without saying a word. Shortly
after he went to the Judge and told him
, that he knew who had found the missing
atone and if Mrs, Campbell would give
â  him her earrings he would get a new
stone put in the setting and make her a
, present of it. He got the earrings, and
pawned them. After the Judge's death
Mrs. Campbell attempted to get t*e ear
i rings back from Keating without success,
! and Campbell's subsequent death put an
i end to the matter.
She has now discovered that the ear
rings are in the Nevada JÂ»an Office and
wants to regain possession of them.

OUR BLANCHE
IS TRULY "ONE"
OF OUR GIRLS"
ONE of Our Girls" was not writ

end for the French have long
since lifted the drawbridge and
shut down the portcullis on the
prejudices they entertain in favor of their
domestic institutions, and you'll never
take them by storming them with an
American comedy. Nor is the lesson for
usâ our girls are given guidance and a
liberal rein from the start and seldom
fail to keep "inside the rails" and reach
the matrimonial goal bright eyed and
pure hearted. The sarcasm of the com
edy la what pleases us. We do enjoy
"taking a rise" out of the devotee of
Froissart, and we are glad that Bronson
Howard has given us a chance. The
play, if old fashioned and wordy, is in
teresting and amusing, has quiet effective
curtain drops, some very bright dialogue
and never loses sight of its intentions.
The episode of the American girl and the
Irish officer in a French situation is ab
surd and much better acted than the sit
uation (?) deserves. A true Irishman
would have throttled Florian de Crebil
lon at the third word and a Frenchman
of the Henri St. Hilaire order, even if
fainting, would have run him through in
a trice. Neither of them would have al
lowed Kate Shipley to hear more than
a phrase of "that tongue's utterance.
The presence of that creature, whose
character is to be counted "but an inci
dent In the progress of the noble fam
ily," would hay- brought any self-respect
ing male to arms In hot haste, rhi slap
came aeons too late. But there are com
pensations for this mistake, and we wish
Mr Howard would write oftener. Vi hy
is his pen practically silent of late years"!
Will not a man lose his skill by Inac-
Miss Bates Is one of our girls, and that
she plays the role so evenly, charmingly
and satisfactory is no BUrprise. Ihe
power to hold the stage merrily for many
minutes, as she does in the second act,
denotes ability of no mediocre order, and
so infectious Is the mirth that ere we
know it we are all laughing with her
She might add to the present chtirm of
the little scene if she faced the audience
less, in fact, the atmosphere of solilo
quy now a little thin, would be perfectly
created if she turned her back upon us
altogether. This will be counted a dra
matic heresy, but in revival week I wish
she would try it. Now let us speak ot
beautiful things, not calmly, but in great
peace Emerson's essays express a strong
belief in th.- man who changes his mind;
who says one thing to-day and the op
posite to-morrow, and with this backing
let the words "Miss Bates does not un
derstand the art of dressing" be for the
present recalled. Her gowns this week,
especially two and three, are dainty, ar
tistic and beautiful. When she throws
over the reseda of number two a cloak
with a touch of pink and a dash of black
harmony is complete. She may fearlessly
speak of her "very best hat," for that
hat is to be coveted and it finishes a cos
tume that must be seen to be appreci-
Miss Bates does ingenious comedy with
girlish simplicity, and in the early scenes
her Julie Is given just the right touch,
but neither she nor Mr. Hiekman are
emotional, and when thÂ« sentiment deep
ens they fail to satisfy. Harrington Rey
nolds plays the quiet character of JÂ»r.
CJlrodet exceedingly well; and Augustus
Cook, whom we knew last week as Na
poleon, is so very different and properly
hateful as De Crebillon that one scarcely
knows him. He is artistically revolting
and this is meant for praise. Mr. Arm
ory as De Fouche.-Fonblanque wakes up
toward the end of the play and comes on
to explain things in a really comical way.
Mr. Frawley, no matter what the char
acter is always the same. The only
thing that distinguishes Captain Gregory
from any other part he has played is an
Irish brogue, which ta< comes by honest
ly and honestly delivers. The minor sup
port Is fair and th( production as a whole
certainly worth the full week's run.
The right to criticize bad scenery should
not be sparingly used if we are to coax
the ruler? of our scenic world to be mer
ciful to man. The scenery at the Cali
fornia is simply hideous. If there Is an
artistic set in the files, it has not yet been
wheeled out, and the furniture that con
glomerates upon the stage reminds one of
houses furnished by the gifts of kind
friends who knew naught 01 each other's
intentions. Last night, a certain ugly
green table cover, much beloved of the
property man, came out once more to
decorate a well-built table with decent
carving and a polished top. In the sec
ond act, thank goodness, a sudden gust
of managerial wind whisked it away, but,
although one should be able to "nuell the
visions of the inmost eye when they rise
sinfully," one remembers to the end that
that table cover, in whose fringe one's
nerves are knotted, had covered that ta
ble. May It never appear again. Who

Midweek Dramatic Notes.
At the Columbia Theater this evening
Charles Frohman will present Henry Mil
ler and the special company in an artistic
production df "Hamlet." The revival of
this great Shakespearean drama will
i have a cast of particular strength, and
-cenic ami costume embellishments
there will be absolutely nothing lacking.
Erfwin Stevens has been specially engaged
to play the King of Denmark. The play
! will be given for three nights and a Sat
urday matinee. Next Monday "Brother ,
Officers," a London Garrick Theater sue-:
â¢ ess, will be given a first presentation in
this country.
'Madame Sans Gene" will be played at
the California to-night and for the re
mainder of the week. Monday evening
will witness th<- first production on any
stage of Mr. < Ilinton Stuart's "A Fairy
Godmother."
In the wake of suc^ss and popular com
mendation, Miss Florence Roberts will
follow her "Rom< o and Juliet" at the
Alcazar by another play of ancient writ- i
ing and pronounced worth. "The Lady of
Lyons." Miss Roberts has given the play
many months of careful study and will
no doubt be a charming Pauline. In the
role of Melnotte, Miss Roberta will find
capable support in White Whlttlesey â 
who in his characterization this week of
Romeo has won much admiration. Mark!
Thall. who has just returned from the
Bast, announces the production of many
attractive plays for thf coming season.
"Captain Letterblair," "Lord Chumley" ;
and "The Manicure" are of the list.
At the Grand Opera-house "Boccaccio" I
is doing an excellent business. The new I
march, the new people and the excellent !
chorus seem to have made a hit.
"Lucia" and "Alda" on alternate nights
have crowded the Tivoli to the limit of
Its capacity. The grand opera season will
no doubt be a great success.
The best bill seen at the Orpheum for

TO COUNTERACT
NEGLIGENCE OF
HEALTH BOARD
Vaccination Bureau to
Be Established.
MONEY IS APPROPRIATED
SERIOUS ACCIDENTS DEMAND
ING SPEEDY ATTENTION.
Supervisors Come to the Aid of City
and Physicians Volunteer Their
Services Gratis to
Patients.
The second day under the new regime
instituted by that most humane body, the
San Francisco Board of Health, was very
much like the first, with the exception
that the arrogance and indifference of the
Health Officers of this city have provok
ed outside assistance for the needy and
the unfortunate victims of accidents de
manding Immediate attention.
The Supervisors have acted, and they
promise the Health Board $417 monthly
for the purchase of 3000 points of virus.
This will permit of free vaccination to the
many applicants who have sought inocu
lation but were refused. Dr. Max Klonk
has offered his services gratis and with
one or two other volunteering physicians
will establish a vaccinating bureau in the
old place. The bureau will be open this
morning at ii o'clock and the work of in
oculation will begin. Over 200 parents
have registered, and they will be notified
by the Health Department.
The resolutions of the Supervisors were
the work of Aigeltinger and Holland and
has been signed by Fhelps, Attinger, Per
rault, Kalben and Black. It is as fol
lows:
To the Honorable the Board of Health of the
City and County of San Franciscoâ Gentlemen :
Owing to the fact that your honorable board
have leemed it your duty to stop the free
vaccination of children your attention is re
spectfully called to the following preamble and
ilutiona signed by members of the Board of
Superviaora to avert the danger of suspending
vaccination, the Intention being to afford here
after sufficient means to enable this important
duty to our citizens to be continued:
\Vhereas, The present conditions relative to
free vaccination of children has ceased by
virtue of the action of the Board of Health,
that board alleging as a reason the insufficient
amount as provided by this board in their esti
mate for the maintenance of said department;
and whereas, the admission of our children to
the common schools is Inhibited unless they
present a proper certificate of vaccination; and
whereas, recognizing the necessities of afford
ing our citizens the privilege of having their
children admitted to and receive the benefits
of tuition In our common schools, various physi
cians have volunteered to perform this service
â¢I BUpplled with the virus necessarily required.
Then fore
Resolved That the undersigned members of
this ard! on behalf of this city and county,
hereby pledge themselves to vote for and order
paid all demands for the virus required to vac
cinate all children and other persons who are
unable to pay for said service.
Resolved, That the attention of the Board of
Health is respectfully called to this Important
Bubject and In order to nfford all opportuni
ties to our citizens said board Is respectfully
requested to accept the services of all compe
tent physicians to perform the service and to
announce by publication that free vaccination
as formerly will be accorded to all In the of
fice of the Health Department as formerly car
ried on and conducted.
The most important case yesterday
which shows the necessity of the continu
ous operation of a receiving hospital was
that of Walter Coffey, a son of the ex-
Supervisor. Tuesday night Coffey was ar
rc ated for drunkenness ami discharged
yesterday morning. He began his alco
holic excursion upon his release and wan
dered over to the patrol wagons by the
entrance to the City Prison. Driver Hrp
i.l.-r advised him to go home, and CofTey
started "ff, but returned. Heppler went
Into the police office, and upon his return
!',.un<l Coffey unconscious on the floor.
Coffey had leaned against the wagon and
was kicked by the horse, his right arm
being shattered to splinters. Coffey was
put in the wngon and driven toward the
Receiving Hospital, but one of the horses
â¢vi! on the corner af Grove and Larkln
â -. I >r. Tltlntz learned of the case
and went to Coffey's assistance. He was
carried into the Receiving Hospital, Dr.
Helntz attending to him at once, as he
feared the sufferer would Meed to death

RELATIVES MEET.
Arrangements for the First
Meal to the Returning
Soldiers.
Yc-Fterday the association of parents and
relatives of men in the First California
Volunteers held a meeting in the armory
of the National Guard at Sls Ellis street.
The relatives representing the several
companies of the regiment organized for
the purpose of working to secure dona
tions of money from relatives to meet the
expense of the feast that will he given to
the beys immediately after landing. Mrs.
Charles J Burke was chosen chairman
for Company A, Mrs. V. Balr for Com-
Dany B Mrs. C. C. Goodale for Company
C Mrs T. C. McCreigh for Company D,
Mrs W A. Clack for Company E, R. C.
Rockwitz for Company F Mrs T. W.
Sparrowe for Company G, Mrs. Mary Mc-
Keon for Company H, A. Son for Com
pany I J. R- Young for Company X, T.
J Foley for Company L and Mrs. Samuel
Seymour for Company M of the regiment.
Mrs. H T. Morton was chosen chairman
for the Heavy Artillery.
The announcement was mane that on
Friday evening there will be a meeting of
the association in the armory on Ellis
street for the purpose of hearing reports
from the several chairmen as to the mat
ter of collections and to arrange for the
meal that is to be prepared, but as it is
not known when it is to be served the
association is undecided whether to call
it a breakfast or a lunch.
It was announced that Company M will
establish headquarters at the residence
of Mrs. Charles Rchn at 2030 Mission
street, where thoee interested can obtain
Information or make donations. Company
B will establish its headquarters at the
Page-street armory and there will be
some one there every day from 10 o'clock
this morning. The majority of the com
panies will rendezvous at the Ellis-street
armory, where contributions will also be
received.
During the meeting there was pome dis
cussion as to whether General Shufter,
Governor Gage, Adjutant General Sea
man and Mayor Phelan should be invited
to take part in the festivities with the
parents and relatives.
The trend of the discussion was that if
the invitations were limited to the five
named they wouM be welcomed, but there
appeared to be some objection to having
the Staff of each of tiie military gentle
men No action was taken in the matter
and It will probably be further discussed
before the executive committee.
The announcement was made that the
executive committee had decided to issue
badges, which will admit parents and
relatives into the ferry building, to
fathers mothers, brothers, sisters and
children and such other relatives as may
be entitled to receive the same. These
will be ready for distribution at the Ellis
street armory after to-morrow, and those
who wish them and can establish their
claim to them will be able to receive them.
They will be furnished at costâ s cents
each No one without a badge will be
admitted into the building.
The Order of Knights and Ladles of
Honor, which some time ago gave an en
tertainment for the benefit of the boys in
blue, has donated the sum of $25 to the
fund' of this association out of the remain
der of the amount realized by the enter
tainment.
During the meeting books were distrib
uted to those who are to collect funds.
It is said that the Queen of Sweden's
enthusiasm for the Salvation Army and
its works has caused a certain amount of
dissatisfaction to be felt at court by
those who do not feel in sympathy with
the army's methods.

MARRIAGES OF
CHILDREN END
WITH SORROW
Little Laura Graham
Is Now Free.
WEDDED FOUR MONTHS AGO
BUT FIFTEEN WHEN SHE WAS
LED TO THE ALTAR.
Another Wife Who Was Married as
a Child Must Produce More Evi
dence Befora Being
Given a Decree.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, J
908 Broadway, Aug. 2.
Two wives, who married at the romantic j
age of 15, have sought the aid of the dl
voroe court to set them free.
I,aura J. Graham has been granted a
divorce after about four months of mar- i
rled life. In the early part of the pres- |
ent year she met Graham, and after an :
acquaintance of two weeks they were
married. She was but a girl of 15 years,
and knew nothing of the world or of the :
responsibilities of housekeeping. Her j
dream of happiness soon vanished. For I
one week after her marriage she and her
husband lived together pleasantly. Dur- j
ing the next week they began to quar
rel, and after seven weeks of living un- j
der the same roof the little girl went
back to her mother and told her that she j
wns tired of married life.
The child recited many instances of be
havior on the part of her husband that
appeared to be almost cruel. Apparently
his love for the child died out as fast as j
that of the young wife's, for at the end (
of two months he was quite willing that
somebody else should keep her and that
she should apply for a divorce. He de
clined to support her or supply her with |
a home, and three months after the wed- i
ding an application for divorce was filed, j
ar.-i now I,aura is at liberty to try mat
rimony again.
Mrs. Francis Claflin, a very handsome
young woman, was married some years '
â  ago when she al?" was a young girl. For
I a few years affairs were comparatively
' smooth in their borne In Massachusetts,
] but when she arrived at the age when
I young women are generally supposed to
: he turning their thoughts to matrimony,
| conditions were so unpleasant that she '
i was forced to leave her husband. Jeal
j ousy was the great difficulty, and Claflin
i tried to school his wife in the belief that
I her proper place was pre-eminently the
j kitchen, and that parlors, drawing-rooms
I and reception-rooms might be for hus
bands and their friends, but not for a i
wife. This behavior drove. Mrs. Claflin ;
from home, and after residing in Oakland
some years she told her troubles to the
court. As she left her husband and there i
is no proof that he is not willing to pro- '
vide her a home, and as Mrs. Claflin al
[< ceil desertion and failure to provide as
reasons for being granted a divorce, the
court has seen tit to delay the issuance
of the decree until such time as she can '
produce more positive evidence that the
separation was the fault of her husband.

A CHRISTIAN HOME FOR
UNIVERSITY WOMEN
BERKELEY, Aug. 2.â The old Hoffman
house at 2222 Shattuck avenue, formerly
occupied by the. Delta Kappa Epselon
Fraternity, is to be turned over this year
into a home for women students who are
members of the University of California
Young Woman's Christian Association.
This move has been under considtnui>>n
for some time past and it will be tried this
year as an experiment. The house will
be under the care of Mrs. F. H. Robin
son, wife of the Rev. F. H. Robinson,
pastor of the Westminster Presbyterian
Church in West Berkeley. It will be
opened as a home to all women who be
long to the Christian Association, the un
derstanding being that it is to servo as
Ihe headquarters for all the receptions
and the soda! side of the association's
work. The charge for board has been
placed at a nominal figure.
Miss K. M. Bunnell, president of the Y.
W. C. A., in an Interview to-day, said
that before long the women hoped to
found a home of their own, to be rented
and used by themselves exclusively. If
the experiment this year proves success
ful steps will at once be taken to bring it
about.

The Hospital System at the
Presidio Occupies Ten
Barracks.
Hospital wards have the right of way at
the Presidio now, and if patients con
tinue to come in with no relief to the hos
pital capacity there will soon be nothing
but hospital buildings at the post. At
present there .ire ten sets of barracks de
voted to the use of the hospital Krclce.
Three of these are the new brick barracks
recently erected. There are two more of
these brick barracks now occupied by the
butteries of the Third Artillery forming
the garrison of the post, and by a detach
ment of recruits. It is not unlikely, how
ever, that the recruits will have to leave<
the barracks and go under canvas, and
then it may be that the batteries will
have to follow them.
Colonel Girard. who is In charge of the
entire general hospital system at the post,
says he thinks he will have room enough
for all. however. He is discharging m<?n
as fast as he can, and if his patients get
along well he -expects to have 300 beds
vacant by the time the next hi spital ship
arrives. This will be the Leelanaw..

OAKLAND, Aug. 2.â There promises t

Morgan Spears Files
Suit for Divorce.
HAD TO SEEK ANOTHER HOME
OBDERED HIM AWAY AT POINT
OF A PISTOL.
Nettie J. Spears of Sanger. Fresno
County, Is the Defendant in a
Bather Sensational
Divorce Suit.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, Aug. 2.
Morgan C. Spears, an employe of the
Oakland Transit Company, tiled a rather
.sensational divorce suit against his wife,
Nettie J. Spears, In the Superior Court
this afternoon, charging hi-r with cruelty
and desertion.
Back of the simple statutory grounds
given in the complaint, however, are alle
gations of an experience that might easily
have terminated in his untimely death.
The plaintiff husband charges that his
cruel spouse during November. 1898, in the
city of Fresno, drew a pistol on him dur
ing a fit of extreme jealousy and pulled
the trigger, after ordering him to seek a
home elsewhere, but the weapon missed
tire.
"I am not an expert at dodging bullets,"
says the suing husband, "and though I
thought I might avoid a row she pulled
the trigger before I was aware of it.
Luckily I escaped, and I have never re
turned to her since.
"The defendant hns a hasty, violent
temper," continues Mr. SDears in his com
plaint, "and an intensely jealous disposi
tion; and she has, though without C&US4
or provocation, become very jealous of
plaintiff In regard to his attentions to
other women. Since he left home she has
at various times and within a few months
| written letters to him accusing him of be
ing 1 untrue.
3 The plaintiff believes that she still en-
S tertains a like feeling toward him, and
that if he were to live with her again he
1 would be in imminent danger of violence
! and great bodily injury at her bands."
Spears alleges also that hie wife fre
quently, in the presence of their four chil
dren, accused him of having improper re
lations with divers women at Sanger,
where Mrs. Spears resides.
Though Mrs. Spears' version of the mat
rimonial tribulations and differences of
their household has not been beard it is
understood she will appear to contest the
suit most bitterly.

dier sold the monkey to him on July 15

willingly give $10 for him. Robis^n wrote

ENTIRELY NEW
CREW TO GO OUT
ON THE HANCOCK
'Engineers and Deck
Officers at Outs.
FORMED AN UNHAPPY FAMILY
HEBOIC MEASURES AIX>PTED
BY UNCLE SAM.
Beer Sold Like Hot Cakes at St.
Michaelâ A Mammoth Tusk
Brought Down on the
Steamer Samoa.
Uncle Sam is taking heroic measures
with the crew of the transport Hancock.
When the vessel goes out again she will
I carry a new list of officers, from (he
captain down. In this way the quarter
master hopes to secure peace and har
mony aboard and make the Hancock a
model transport.
There has been a great deal of friction
on the transport ever since she went into
commission. The engineers have been at
I outs among themselves and also with the
j deck officers, and in consequence all kinds
jof charges were in the air. The trouble
began the trip before last, when Chief
Engineer Murphy was taken sick and had
to be sent to the hospital at Manila. In
stead of promoting tHe first assistant to
the chief's place the Government sent
| over to the transport Senator and made
; First Assistant Owens of that vessel chief
1 of the Hancock.
The appointment was resented by every
! engineer on the Hancock and the trouble
; began. Captain Ames was drawn into the
j squaoble and the result was that several
' of the engineers were confined to their
i rooms as mutineers. When the vessel ar
-1 rived in San Francisco a number of the
i men left the ship and a temporary peace
was patched up. The men s animosity
! against Owens for taking the place of
] the chief only slumbered, however, and a
; trifling incident soon had everybody in
I hot water again. An order by the chief
j engineer brought back a short answer
: and soon all hands were by the ears.
This state of affairs lasted until the
Hancock got back to San Francisco iast
j week. Then it was that Uncle Sam
adopted heroic measures. Chief Engineer
Murphy, whose illness caused the change
i that gave rise to all the trouble, came
S back from Manila on the City of Peking
: and has taken control of the Hancock's
engine room again. All the other engin
eers nave resigned and new men will take
'â  their places. Captain Ames has also re
| signed and a new master will be appoint-
I fd. In fact, when the Hancock goes to
1 sea again she j*'Hl practically carry a
new .~et of men from captain to cabin boy.
The Hancock requires a thorough over
hauling and thousands of dollars will have
to be spent on her before she can go to
sea again. H>r machinery is in a bad
way and the bottom Is very foul. She is
too long to go into the Hunters Point dry
dock and if the Government does not
> send her to Seattle to load she will be
docked at Hongkong. If she goes to Se
attle she will go on the Port Orchard
j dock. The Hancock was taken to the
i Union Iron Works yesterday morning, but
j as she was drawing too much water she
j could not get alongside the wharf. At
â  high water last night she was got along
; side and the work of repairing her will
begin to-day.
The steamer Samoa is back in the Eu
r.'kit run again. She made one trip to
St. Michael and Cape Nome and proved
1 herself to be one of the best all-round
â  vessels that went to the gold fields this
i year. Among the passengers who came
down with her was Charles Eckland. He
i brought down with him a mammoth tusk,
j which he dug out of his claim on El Do
j rado Creek. It Is 6 feet 6 inches long.
i There were also a number of skull bones
, in the hole that the tusk came out of,
but Mr. Eckland did not secure any of
them. He is taking the tusk buck East
with him.
Another passenger who came down on
â  the Samoa was Sumner Carson, son of
the millionaire mill owner of Humboldt.
Mr. Carson went to Dawson on a specu
i lating trip and did well. He secured a
; couple of good mines and brought home
with him a long stocking filled v/lth sold.
He says he washed it out of one or his
mines himself. If he did he now has had
some practical experience at mining that
j may stand him in good stead.
The Samoa took 184r> casks of beer to
i St. Michael and Cape Nome. Every cask
j was sold fur $75 inside of forty-ei.rrht
' hours and then the miners were crying

able men in the department, and on ac
count of his courteous treatment and
ever-ready assistance in promoting the
Interests of the force he has endeared
himself not only to Chief Lees and the
other Commissioners but to every mem
ber of the department. As .soon as his
appointment as sergeant was announced
he was besieged by his friends, who
warmly congratulated him on his pro
motion.

poral to take the place of Norman.
Policeman Dennis Courneen was retired
on a pension at his own request. Cour
neen has been connected with the depart
ment for over thirty years, and as he hafl
grown tired of the service he asked to be
retired. The request was unanimously
granted.

there was only a parade of the lame and

plank and into the charge of the surgeons j
awaiting them.
There were about 250 of them, the net

35 YEARS
Eleven on One Limb at One Time
With Excruciating Pain. All
Remedies Tried, and Number-
less Physicians Little Benefit.
CUTICURA Speedily Cures.
My mother ha* been a victim to talceni from
*aricoÂ«o veins for thirty-five years. Eleven of
theee terrible pore* have existed at one time on
the limb affected. Excruciating pain and intense
â tsfferingwere endured, with all sorts of remedies
on trial nnd numberless physicians' calls and
prencriptiona applied, but all practically with
but little benefit. However, at laet the remedial
agent was found In Ccticuha (ointment), -which
â¢urely proved its weight in gÂ»?ld, alleviating pain
and causing healing processes to commence and
a cure speedily effected. She has, also, used
Ccticcka with marked benefit in erysipelas
ef the face ar.d eczema. The Clticura Soap,
also, lias established a record only as the best
cleansing, purifying, and healing in its nature,
having proved itself a most excellent and valu-
able auxiliary to the Cctictjra (ointment).
I would remark that thin testimonial is entirely
unsolicited, being a voluntary contribution for
humanity* sake, and the commendation of the
Cuticura REMEDir.u to the fullest corrfideDce,
being satisfied of their purity, genuineness, and

able by the hospital stewards and their
companions. Then the remainder of the
sick men were allowed to leave the ship
and soon their baggage was sent after
them. On the Presidio there were nine
teen wagons of all shapes and sizes wait
ing to take the men to the hospital. As
before the bedridden patients were cared
for first. They were taken at once to the
general hospital proper, while the others
went to the convalescent wards in the
hrick barracks or to the .wards in the
wooden barracks. Before leaving the ship
Colonel Girard had each man given a Â«iip
upon which was written the letter and
number of his ward and bed. and when
the wagon drove up to the hospital door
the surgeon had but to look at these slips
to know where the men should so. There
was not a hitch or mistake and before two
hours had passed the men had been taken
from the ship, had been made comfortable
in iheir new homes, their baggage being
I unloaded from the trucKs at trie noor, ana
i most of them had had their dinner. The
; quartermaster's department had furnisnea
1 the hospital and the hospital corps had
j furnished the cooks, so the first thing
i that greeted the weary travelers was the
welcome sound of the dinner bell.
There is not at present a serious case
; among the Relief's passengers. Some of
i them have been very serious, but they
1 are all convalescing now an/1 there will
! nothing- for them to do but to get well if
they can. There are some who will never
| fully recover from the effects of their
j service, but there will be no deaths among
i them unless the unlooked for happens. On
the way here three of the men died, one
from the effects of his wounds and the
other two from disease, but otherwise
the trip up was made without incident.
There are six San Francisco men among
! the Invalids, all from the First California
Regiment. Four of them are suffering
! from wounds. Slade is the worst of the
. six. fie was wounded in the left leg be
i low the knee at San Pedro Mecarte and it
j had to be amputated; Jantzen and
Thompson and Yerg were also wounded
and Scrase and McDonald are down with
i dysentery- Two men from the California
Volunteer Artillery are also among- the
I number.
! On the whole the sick men are not un
happy. They have been divided into three
classesâ those who are bedridden and 'who
need the attendance, of female nurses;
t hose who can partially care for them
selves and who are on diet, and those who
are . o far recovered that they need no
i attention and who are allowed to eat any-
I thing.- They are well cared for and they
get all the liberty possible, and many of
1 them will be ready to be discharged when
their regiments come home.

THE KEYSTONE BOYS

9 o'clock this morning:, and as the
regiment swings into Market street
The Call's cannon will be fired three
times to announce the beginning of
the march to the Presidio.
Three heavy batteries, one light
battery and the regimental band of
the Third Artillery will act as escort,
supplemented by the Nebraskans,
with possibly the Oregonians and
Utah men.
The line of march will be: East

PLANS BIG RECEPTION
FOR CALIFORNIA BOYS
Citizens' Committee Decides on a Grand Night
Parade With Electric Arches and Fire
works to Dazzle the Multitude.
THE gallant soldlrr hoys of the
First California Volunteers will be
accorded a grand welcome home
from the Philippines if the plans
of the Citizens' Committee which
has general charge of the arrange
ments for their reception are not
marred by some unforeseen inci
dent. The committee has taken
hold of the work with great energy and
already a large amount of preliminary
work hns been accomplished. A general
scheme for the reception and entertain
ment of the Califomiar.F was mapped out
at the meeting of the committee in the
office of Mayor Phelan in the Phelan
building yesterday afternoon, and pro
vides for a big torchlight parade of the j
veterans on the evening of their arrival,
accompanied by a grand display of fire
works all along the line of march and a
banquet in the big ferry building at the |
foot of Market street. This parade will
be In addition to the parade of the troops
from the wharf to the Presidio in the
forenoon, which will be of a more in- i
formal character, although none the less j
imposing.
The full committee was present at yes- j
i terday's meeting. Mayor Phrtan an
i nounced that he had received a commu- '
j nication from Lieutenant Colonel Barnett [
1 of the Pennsylvania regiment, requesting '
permission to use the rotunda of the City
Hall, where the remains of the gallant
Colonel Hawkins could lie in state until j
they were shipped East. The Mayor said |
he had granted there-quest. The Mayor was
appointed a committee of one to arrange
for the draping of the rotunda for the re
ception of the body. The Mayor also re
ported that in view of the desire of the
Pennsylvanians not to be accorded a
public reception he had addressed the fol- j
lowing letter to the commanding officer
of the reaLment:
SAN FRANCISCO, Augu.-t 2, â 
Lieutenant Colonel Barnett, Pennsylvania
United States Volunteer KepimÂ«nt Dear Sir:
I'lease accept on behalf oi your regriment the i
sincere sympathy of th<> \ eople of San Fran
cisco In your great bereavement. The death
uf Colonel Hawkins saddens the otherwise
cordial reception which our '-iti/.trns ha.l pre
pared for you. Should you decide to have the
body of your late Colonel lie In state, 1 re- :
gpectfully offer you the us. 1 of the rotunda of
our City Hall. Tours truly.
JAMES J. PHELAN, Mayor.
Secretary McPike reported that he had
contracted for the erection of a tent 30x60
in Union square to be used as a reception
tent, the contractors also agreeing to put
up a smaller tent 12x16 for the headquar- i
ters of the committee gratis, both tents
to be ready lor occupancy to-day. The
secretary's action was approved and AN..
11. Leahy was appointed a committee of
one to purchase .five dozen chairs to be
placed in the tents. The secretary was
also instructed to arrange for lighting the
tents with electricity.
The subject of benefits to be given by j
the various theaters in aid of the recep- !â 
tion fund was then taken up, A. M. Law- \
rence stating that it was hoped to raise j
at least 15000 by this means and urging
the necessity of immediate action. By
invitation of the committee, representa
tives of nearly all the theaters with the
exception of Morosco's and the Alcazar
were present to give their views on the
display of flags and decorations, and
the streets will be lined with cheering
thousands who recognize no State
lines in their efforts to show the re
turning veterans that their patriotic
work has been appreciated.
Out of respect to the memory of Colo
nel Hawkins nothing was oone on the
transport Senator yesterday. The men
were allowed the freedom of the biu Gov
ernment dock, and later many were al
lowed Into the city. They slept aboard,
however, and this morning they will
march up Market street, as the others
have done, and the city will turn out to
welcome them with cheers and whistles.
and flags, just as If there never had been
a volunteer parade passing along the cob
bles.
This morning at 0 o'clock the regiment
will disembark. Awaiting it will be three
heavy batteries and one light battery of
the Third Artillery and the regimental
band, under command of Captain Sedg
wick Pratt, Third Artillery, which will
act as escort. In addition the Nebraska
men will turn out and probably the Utah
men, but up to last evening Major Grant
had issued no orders regarding the mat
ter. The Oregon regiment' has also been
invited to parade, but General Summers
had issued no orders last evening. The
entire escort will form on East street.
each organization with its own bantt, so
there should be no lack of martial music.
There will also be ten Red Cross ambu
lances for the weak and infirm. At the
Presidio everything is .in readiness for
the Pennsylvania men. They will be
Quartered between the Oregon and the
Nebraska men, and all they will have, to
do Is to take possession. Th,ey should be
comfortably <|iiarterfcd before, the middle
of this afternoon.'
The body of Colonel Hawkins was re
moved from the transport yesterday at
noon and was taken to an undertaking
establishment, where it is being prepared
for burfai. Jt has a guard of men from
the regiment constantly watching over it,
and when it goes East there will be one
of the officers of the regiment detailed to
accompany it.
The time for the funeral has not. yet
been set, but it is not probable it will be
held sooner than Saturday or Sunday.
Mayor Phelan has offered the use of the
rotunda of the City Hall in which to havo
the body lie in state, but his offer has not
yet been accepted. So far the arrange
ments contemplate a funeral service at
the Masonic Temple and an escort of
troops and Knights Templar.
There will be no successor to the colonel
appointed unless present plans be
changed. The regiment is to be in service
such a short time that it has been decided
to be mustered out as a Hawkins regi
ment, and the desire of the men in this
direction will probably be granted.
Among the trophies of the regiment are
three ancient Spanish guns secured at the
Wall City arsenal. The largest belongs to
Lieutenant Colonel Barnett, who Intends
to present it to the State of Pennsylva
nia. The piece bears the inscription: "Se
villa. 1776." Another gun and quite a
small one is a little pivot "lantaka. It
is evidently very old and of but little use
as a weapon of defense. The third is an
elaborately carved brass piece, also fitted
with a pivot; but neither it nor. the little
one carries a date or inscription of any.
kind. The third gun belongs to Major
Berier. All three guns were purchased by
the officers of the regiment after the fall
of the arsenal. The two smaller ones came
from Mindanao and the large one , from
the Sulus. , ?â â  - : -l'i â 
As soon as the transports docked yes
terday morning three -men were sent to
the general hospital at the Presidio. They
were Rudolph Themke of Company D, en
listed at "Manila, who was insane; Loman
J. Waddell of Company B, Buffering from
dysentery, and James Clark of Company
E, suffering from appendicitis. r The re
mainder of the men are in excellent
health.

subject and to offer suggestions. Mr.
Morosco sent word that he would agree
to do as well as the other theaters, and
it Is understood Mr. Belasco of the Alca
zar is equally willing. Manager Fried
lander said he wished to correct a mis
understanding in regard to the report that
he had agreed to donate the gross receipts
of one night's performance. He could not
do that, as he was not In a position to
ask the Frawley Company, now playing at
the California, to donate their services.
He was willing, however, to arrange a
matinee performance for the benefit of
the fund. Manager Gottlotj of the Co
lumb.vi suggested that all the theaters
combine in giving one big benefit. This
met with the approval of Manager Leahy
of the Tlvoli, who thought the Orpheurh
Offered the best facilities for such a per
formance.
It was pointed out that not more than
.SIBOO or $2000 could be raised by a single
benefit, and W. J. Martin. The Call rep
resentative on the committee, suggested
as a solution of the difficulty that the
entire matter be referred to the various
theater managements to arrange individ
ual benefits and turn the proceeds over
to the committee, thus providing an in
centive to each to do its best. After some
further discussion, however, it was de
cided to constitute the managers of all
the theaters a committee to take charge
of the matter, the idea being that three
separate benefits shall be given, two the
aters to contribute to- each. A meeting
of this committee will be held in the Co
lumbia at 10 o'clock this morning. Man
ager Meyerfeld announced that he would
entertalrt the Pennsylvania volunteers at
the Orphcum any evening selected by the
committee, and Mr. Martin was delegated

Colonel Sullivan reported that the hos
pital ship Relief had arrived in port and
that he had taken out a supply of deli
cacies for those on board, but that while
tin- courtesy was appreciated by those in
charge of the ship, the proffered "good
les" had been declined and had then been
taken to the Presidio to be distributed
among the volunteers there.
\Y. J. Martin, chairman of the commit
tee on decorations, reported that he had
appointed the following gentlemen to
serve with him on that committee: W.
H. Mills. Robert Oxnard, I. W. Hellman
Jr., Henry P. Fortman and A. Schilling.
H<> also reported that designs for the two
ric arches authorized at the last
meeting of tin- committee would be re
celved Friday. Mr. Martin's report was
adopted, and he then offered a resolution
that it be the sense of 'the committee
that there be a night parade. Mayor Phe
lan suggested that it might not be ad
visable to have two parades, and that it
had already been decided that the volun
teers should march from the wharf to
the Presidio in the morning. Mr. Martin
stnmgly contended that without a night
parade the whole effect of the electric
display would be marred. This view of
the i ase was taken by Mr. Lawrence and
the resolution was adopted.

The c< mmittee received its ftrst news of
the death of gallant Colonel Hawkins
while Mtill on the road and the first thin?
it did upon arriving last night was to
meet, late as the hour was, ami pass reso
lutions of sympathy and condolence.
Beyond taking care of their boys in a
general way the committee has made no
plans for their entertainment while here.
They will be takt n home In a body as
soon as they are mustered out and at
Pittsburg a grand jubilee, in which all the
surrounding towns will join, will be held,
and if money, enthusiasm and sincerity
can accomplish anything, they will then
learn of the grateful love in which they
are held by the appreciative people of the
State upon which they have conferred so
much honor.
The committee say? that the railroads
hayÂ« joined with the rest in donating
something toward the welcome home
fund. They have made special rates
which amount to the equivalent of
a $25,000 present and from Chicago
to Pittsburg the entire regiment
will travel on a pass. The only road
which failed to give something was the
Southern Pacific, which, looking at the
matter from a strictly business point of
view, maintains regular rates.

town they stop at within the limits of
their native State, the entire regiment'
will l>e entertained at a monster break

The Force Wants to Join the
Reception.
At the request of Chief Lees, the Pc
lice Commissioners last night took up the
question of assisting in the reception of
the California volunteers who are about
to return from the Philippines. In a stir
ring speech, he depicted the noble work
done by the California boys in th ? re
cent war with Spain. After glorifying
their deeds, the head of the department
suggested that each member be assessed
in order to raise sufficient money to "Rive
the boys a good time," as he expressed it.
\tier considerable discussion, it was
finally decided 'to postpone action In the
matter until the next meeting. '1 he 1 om
uilsstoners are fayorable to Jhe proposi
tion and it is understood that it tneir
next meeting they will order an assess
m> nt levied on each member <<f the de
partment as suggested by Chief Leys.
