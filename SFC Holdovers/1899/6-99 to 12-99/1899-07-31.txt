Â£ __3 H> â * transport Hancock docked
yesterday afternoon, but the
men did not come ashore. They
V are r.oi clad for a climate such
ar: hr-.c beer the rule in San
Francisco for a week back, so it was
decided to keep them one more day on
board in order to have them furnished
with extra clothinf,-.
It was at first âted on the water
front that the delay was caused by the
fact that the army people were not
ready to receive the men at the Pre
=id.c. ar.d because of this they were to
te detained on board. There was no
truth in the report, ever, for it was
found that ths request tame from
Colonel Mul' 3rd, who wished to have
his mer. better clothed before exposing
them, even for a day. to the fog and
the winds which sweep over the Pre
sidio.
As for the camp, it has been ready for
nearly a week, and yesterday morning
meat enough to do the troops until
this evening was taken out there.

It was a sore disappointment to
many, roth on the transport and among
the thousands who stood waiting along
the water front and on the streets. It
was announced that the men would
march up Market street between 1 and
2 o'clock, and as the hour passed, peo
ple began to form along the sidewalks
in the good old Fourth of July way.
Along the water front the i * irymen
gathered together their stokers, and
every ono who owned a boiler began to
get up steam as soon as it *.'â¢ a
learned that the transport was about
to Â»me to the dock. General Sum
mers, commanding the Oregon regi
ment, formed his men and marched
down to the wharf, ar.d two batteries
of light artillery and a troop of cavalry
from the Presidio followed to escort
the homecomers to their camp. They
â¢ took the matter good-naturedly and
turned back without complaint, while
the men on the. troopship resigned
themselves to another day on the water
within sigh! and sound of he city.
The regiment looks well. The sick
list is a small one. and the sick men
who needed immediate attention were
t?ken In ambulant es to the general hos
pital at the Presidio at once. There
were twenty-five in all, not all from
the Nebraska regiment or the Utah Ar
tillery, however, and there are more
who desired to be left on the transport
FIGHTING RECORD OF
NEBRASKA'S HEROES
FEBRUARY 4â An outpost of Nebraska troops near Santa Mesa fired on a.
party of natives who had throe times attempted to cross their lines. Soon
after a gun from blockhouse 7 gave the signal for a general attack on
the American lines, and the Nebraskans -were set upon fiercely by
largely superior numbers, but held their own until reinforced. â¢
The next morning they began the advance, driving the enemy from
Santa Mesa across the San Juan River, capturing San Juan del Monte
and a strong position at the reservoir near by, with a number of prison
ers and a ' ling gun, losing three killed and two wounded.
In this, their first engagement, they behaved like veteran soldiers.
FEBRUARY 7 Continued the advance with the rest of General Hale's brig
ad- and captured the water works on the San Mateo River, ten miles
from Manila, where, they remained on duty until March 24, repelling fre
quent attacks and losing a number of men.
MARCH 24, 25 AND 2r>â Engaged in the general advance that cut the Filipino
army in two and captured Mariquina, with a loss of one killed and four
teen wounded. -
MARCH 27â They made a flank movement on the enemy at Mirilao and drove
their whole fine before them for several miles; loss, fifteen wounded.
MAR' 2<tâ Formed extreme left wing of the flying column which advanced
on Bocave, swung in on the dank and doubled up the Insurgent lines
on the river, killing and capturing a large number, with a loss of ono
killed and 'ten wounded.
MARCH 30â They bore the brunt of the attack on Gulguinto, charg
ing through the rice fields and driving the enemy before them, losing
four killed and thirty wounded.
APRIL 23â Sent out to relieve Major Bell's command, who were engaged near
Quingua. In the fight which ensued Colonel Stotsenberg and Lieuten
ant Sisslon, with two men, were killed and twenty-seven wounded..
MARCH 24 AND 25â Formed the right of Hale's column In the advance from
Quingua on Calumpit, fighting all the way; forded the Chico River nt
the latter place, and with a rush swept the enemy from their works.
Officially commended for their gallantry.
MAY 5 AND &â Fought with Hale over the five miles of ground between
Apallt and St. Tomas, capturing the latter place, with a loss of two
killed and four wounded.
MAY 7â Of the whole regiment at the front 160 were on the sick list, leaving
less than. 3oo fit for duty, and they were soon after ordered back to Ma
nila, where they remained until their departure for home, getting a
much-needed and well-earned rest.

; so they could be in the column when
: the troops march to camp. As many .
! of these will not be able te stand the \
long journey on foot Major Gerard, :
Burgeon in charge of the general hos
pital, has ordered ten ambulances to be
at the dock to take these men along.
At 9 o'clock this morning the troops
will disembark. General Shatter has
ordered an escort, which will include
Troop F of the Sixth Cavalry, Light
Battery C of the Third Artillery, Heavy
Batteries I. Â« > and E of the Third Artil
lery, and the regimental band. The !
â  whole will be under the command of
Captain Pratt. Third Artillery. The
Oregon Regiment will not be In the
escort. It is a long walk and the regi
ment has performed its social duties
when it has taken that walk once. The
real reason is. however, that the work
of mustering out the regiment must not
be neglected and it is only by hard
work that it can be finished on time; j
so the Oregon men will stay in camp
and work.
The most prominent feature of the
troops on the Hancock is their joy at

America the rest seems easy, and as
they hung over th*- side and gazed at
the city, while the transport drew slow
ly in to the dock, they showed plainly
what was perhaps the hardest trial of
all they showed the effects of home
sickness. Not that any individual was
evidently homesick; it was a collective
mental complaint and the whole boat
load had it. It was expected that the
men would disembark at once end bo
the wharf was partially cleared to al
low them to do so, but when it became
known that they would stay aboard for
the night, friends broke through the
line of police and got past the customs
men at the gangway by pass, by per
suasion or by strategy. Any a_y they
got aboard and a good part. of the
crowd "ii the transport's decks was
made up of civilians.
The tug Governor Irwin met the
transport out in. the stream before she
started for the dock. On board were!
Mayor Phelan and the mother and sister
nf Lieutenant Colonel Eager. The ladies
were taken on board but the Mayor I
stayed only to assure the troops of the i
city's welcome. Then he returned to
the wharf to start the cheering, as he
explained. There was little need to
start it or to keep it going. It did both
by itself and it needed no help. The
boilers along the front had not had
time to heat up to blowing pressure, but
th" engineers opened out their whistle.-.
anyway and blew pailfuls of hot water
over 'he surrounding houses in Leu of
noise and steam.
Governor Poynter, Adjutant General
Barry and Congressman Stark from
Nebraska came aboard before th"
i transport's lines were well made fast,
| and they at once paid their respects to
SAX CISCO, 3IONDAY, JULY 31. 1899.
Colonel Mulford. Governor Poynter
explained the situation to Colonel Mul
ford and together they discussed what
was to be done. The experience of the
Oregon regiment suggested the plan of
keeping the men on, the vessel where
they would at least be warm, so Colo
nel Mulford requested leave from Gen
eral Shatter* to keep his men aboard
until this morning. His request was
granted at once, and orders were issued
that no liberty be given man or officer.
The men on the Hancock have had
their experience and they have re
turned anything but . expansionists.
They are not all against expansion, hut
there is not one who thinks the Phil
â â  ippines will ever pay for the time and
; the money they have cost BO far. nor
I for. the blood that has been spilled In
,th*u- "juigfes ari'UHc- fiel*S"h~ .Ttife' â¢â¢â¢js.t-"
ing too much, the men think, and it
will cost much more before the end is
even in sight. Having gone so far the
soldiers see no way but to go on, but
if there could he found an honorable
way out of the warâ a way that will
allow this country to withdraw its
troops and leave the islands to them
selves while not sacrificing any of its
dignity as a nation, "then let them go"
is the cry of the volunteers.
In the judgment of the officers of the
troops the war in the Philippines may
be ended in a month and it may keep
going for twenty years. It will not be
hard to take and hold the seaboard
towns, but it will take years to sub
due the interior. It is not the difficulty
of getting the troops through the isl
ands, for a skirmish line can go wher
ever a man can squeeze through, but
they cannot keep up their supply trains
"WE'RE ALL GLAD TO GET HOME."
j2w___ Hr men are all glad to get home again." said Lieutenant Colonel Frank Eager of the Nebraska regiment, In
felÂ» I -"Peaking of the men who came' in on the troopship. "They are tired and worn out. but they did their duty and
X 1 they have earned a rest. They are in very good condition; they are comfortable, and now that we are at home,

without building roads, and the coun
try is not a pood one for road building.
And chasing the nimble Filipino in his
native haunts is much like chasing the
will-o'-the-wisp.. ..It ..is. generally
thought too, that even should Agui
naldo decide to surrender there would
be another in his place in a day, and
should he propose, surrender to his men
they would probably kill him. These
are" the sentiments of the men who
have just come home.
As for the service, the men are tired
of it though they say so in a dignified
way and not altogether with a note of
regret over their enlistment. They will
not re-enlist. . however, for they have
had their fill. Three men of the Ne
braska Regiment stayed behind in the
islands, two because they had Govern
ment positions and wished to hold
them, and the other to go back into
the service. And there are nearly .1000
men in the regiment.
The men will be mustered out here
in San Francisco. An effort will be
made to get the Nebraska men to come
together after they arrive home and
then the State will give them a recep
tion worthy of them, but it i*Â» feared
that if the "organization once breaks up
there will be no chance of it coming
together Seam.
What the men want is home. It
shows on every line of their faces; it
shines from their eyes; it crops out in
their walk and in their stooped shoul
ders and their listless bearing. They
are tired of a life in the trenches, In
the camps, on the transports and under
a. tropical sun; they want -home and
they want their friends, and the nation
can do them no greater service than to
let them go as soon as possible. They
are sick of the Philippines and sick of
the war, and the*-* are content to let
others talk of holding the islands, while
still others chase the little brown men
deep into their Jungles, and wrest from
them their malarial homes.
"Glad." echoed Captain Talbot of the
Nebraska?, "Just go out there on the
bridge and shout that, question â¢to the
men on the deck." J
SOME OF THE MEN WHO HAVE WON FAME ON THE FIELD.
Even the announcement that they would
not go ashore until this morning did not
stop one ringing cheer nor quench bub
bling enthusiasm. They were home, and
if they had to wait one long day before
they- could go inside it made no difference;
they were willing to put it in looking over
the fence and eating the fruit and grasp
ing the flowers the ladies of the, Jived
Cross and the hosts of friends who lined
the long dock sent up to them. -
.Home means much to the heroes of Utah
and of Nebraska. More than to many of
the volunteers who will return. There
has tot been an engagement throughout
the half year's fighting In which there
has not been one at least of the guns of
the artillery battalion. That brave little
band has been broken up Into all sorts
of Queer and unusual detachments, and it
has been' no uncommon thing for the low
est ranking sergeant in the command to
be sent off finy or a hundred miles from
the main body in full charge of his gun
and its crew. The Utah boys went over
with eight piecesâ they have come back
having twenty-two and with not a man
among then, who cannot go out Into the
thick of the fighting and handle a squad.
With the Nebraska boys, they have been
longer on the firing line and have lain
longer in the trenches than has any other
regiment; and more of both commands
have been carried from the trenches to
the hospitals with the sicknesses that are
bred In fetid swamps under a vertical
sun. It was Nebraska that opened the
fighting, and her boys stayed with it until
the orders came to go home.
Governor Poynter of Nebraska and his
party went aboard as soon as the gang
plank was let down and called upon Colo
nel Mulford and the offices of his staif.
They were followed by the big delegation
that has come out from Salt Lake to
greet the battery boys. There were the
wives of officers, mothers, friends and
political representatives, and In a minute
they were in the hands of the homesick
lads on the deck, being wildly cheered
and warmly embraced. Among the Utah
party were Colonel W. G. Nebeker, Hon.
C. S. Varian and wife. Charles Read.
Hon. Richard Mackintosh and Miss
Blanche Mackintosh. W. S. McCornick
and Miss McCornick. Mrs. William Nelson
and Miss Nelson, Mrs. James A. Miner.
Mrs. 'â liindsey. Hudson, Mrs. F. A. Grant,
wife of Major Frank A. Grant; Mrs. R.
W. Young.- wife of Major Young; .Mrs.
Wedgwood, wife of Captain Wedgwood;
Miss Edna Colin. Henry J. Faust Jr.. Mrs.
Etta Ellenbruck and Miss Ellenbruck,
Hon. H. E. Cary and Lieutenant Grow,
who returned to Salt Lake four months
ago to get well of a wound received in
action.
All told 1136 men came in on the Han
cockâthe two batteries of the Utah artil
lery, under command of Major Grant, and
the Nebraskans, under command of Colo
nel Mulford. Both commanders won their
rank by conspicuous bravery In action.
Major Grant succeeded Major Young in
command of the battalion when the latter
was made a Justice of the Supreme Court
of the Island of Luzon. Colonel Mulford
succeeded Colonel Stot.-*enburg when he
was shot down at Calumplt. Both officers
are Immensely popular* with their men,
and are as glad as the men that the fight
ing is over.
Concerning the administration of affairs
in the Philippines the officers lined to
talk for quotation, although they were
nearly unanimous In the opinion that the
game is not worth the candle. "The whole
archipelago is not worth the money that
has already been expended." said a prom-
inent officer of the Nebraskans. "and both
officers and men on the other side feel that
way about it. However, they say we
have started in -to fight for them, and
they will stick with it until the Govern
ment changes its mind."
Down on the decks,, where the men of
the ranks were, only the same opinion
could be found. It was all right at first
when the fighting was hot and the sensa
tion a new one, but after they had had
time to think it over;. after they had seen
their comrades go down before Tagal bul
lets, or carried sick to the hospitals, and
tried to figure out the compensation for it,
they changed their minds, and only a
longing to get out of it and get home and
forget all about it was left.
The unloading of the transport was be
gun almost as soon as she had docked,
and continued throughout the day. Box
after box was hoisted from the nold and
let down to the customs inspectors on the
dock, to be afterward hustled away by a
detail of battery men under Lieutenant
"Webb. The boys have come back' wish a
hoard of curios and all kinds of light
clothing, but against the more rigorous
climate of San Francisco they are not
protected. Only a few of the artillerymen
nave overcoats and blue flannels. The
Nebraska men have only their khaki uni
form... and are already suffering severely
from cold. They were informed by their
officers, however, that there was every
thing they needed, Including two months
pay. to be had as soon as they get out to
the Presidio.
.HOW SOME .HEROES
WON T.HEIR, STJIRS
I POTTED him all right enough," said
Private W. W. Grayson of Company
D of the Nebraskas. "but I didn't
know when 1 did. it it was going to
start the fun going." It was Private
Grayson who fired the first shot of the
present unpleasantness, and of this oc
currence which has made him famous he
tells a modest, plain tale.
'.We were detailed at outpost No. 2 In
front of Santa Mesa." said he. "and when
we went down there on the morning of
the 4th of February we went out t.i re
connolter and see what we had In front of
us in the way of Filipinos. We bumped
right into a Tagal lieutenant and a couple
of men, and they ordered us to keep off
1 their lines. We ordered them away from
ours, and -they told us that 'to-night the
Americanos would move back or the Fili
pinos would know why.' t That lieutenant
was a particularly aggravating cuss and
he bothered us all day. cursing us in
Spanish and choice Tagallo.
"That night Private Miller and I heard
a signal to our left and an answer to our
right, and then a red light flashed in the
tower of the Filipino blockhouse and we .
knew there was something doing. A
minute later the Filipino lieutenant raised j
up in the brush ahead of us and inside \
our line. I called twice upon him to halt,
but he wouldn't do it and I pulled the
trigger. A little later we caught two
more of them inside and Miller got one
and I the other: then the rifles began to
crack all around us and the fight was on."
There are other heroes on the boat be- j
sides Grayson. Every other man on the
roster has got either a wound or a rec- |
ord, and neither the one nor the other .
was obtained except by some conspicuous
act of bravery in a class of battle that !
afforded ample opportunity for Individ- j
ual daring. Major Frank Grant, com
mander of the now famous little fleet of j
"tinclads" which made "good niggers" of
so many Filipinos along Luzon's rivers, J
earned the title of "Dewey" by his dash !
and fearlessness in action; and action was |
a* thing he had plenty of. It was he who j
took his flagship, the Laguna de Bai. up
the Pasig and with Lieutenant Frank ,
I lines as his second in command captured
the towns of Sexmoan and Guagua, with
not many more men that two' full gun
crews. There isn't a man in all the Utah
battery who does not nonor him with the i
title of "Dewey" when he heaves in sight, :
and Lieutenant Hines is just as much ad- j
mired. â¢ - ' _ _,
Lieutenant W. C. Webb of Battery A of j
the Utahs won more honors than he can i
'comfortably take back to Salt Lake with
him. and also his commission in the regu
lar army as commander of another of the
"tinclads," the Covagonda. When Gen
eral Lawton was attempting to lead his
division down through the province of
Pampagna to connect with the forces of
Major Kobbe, who was. trying to lead his
up. Lieutenant Webb was put in command
of the Covagonda and sent up the Rio
Grande de Pampagna to look into the dis
position of the natives, and if it were not
friendly to give them the best he had.
From Calumpit up he found them peace
able, but when he got to San Luis he ran
into the fire of . 150 concealed rifles nor
twenty yards from the boat. It was here
Sergeant Ford Fisher was killed.
"We turned loose the 'Gats' on them."
said Lieutenant Webb, "and it took us fif
teen minutes to fire 5000 bullets and 100
percussion shells at them. We found over
fifty of them dead in the brush.
The natives of âie district were all ami-
WHERE AND WHEN THE
UTAH BOYS WON FAME
THE fighting record of the "Utah boys" during their year of service I
against the Spaniards and the Filipinos is one of which veterans of many I
campaigns might well be proud. Always' at the front and ready for *
action, they bore a most prominent and efficient part in every fight j
in which Otis' and Hale's brigades, to which they were attached, ,
were engaged. _ I
The two batteries, A and B. commanded respectively by Captain R. V\ : ,
Young and Captain F. A. Grant, left San Francisco with the second cxpedl- *
tion on June 15 -.of last year and reached Cavlte July 17. They were put In j
front of the Spanish lines below Malate, where tiny gave most gallant and I
efficient support to the California and Pennsylvania boys in the attack of 1
the Spaniards on the night of July 31. For their conduct on this occasion they J
received the official thanks of the commander in chief. In the three days' I
continuous fighting which followed the Filipino attack on the night of .
February 4 last they did their full part, assisting in driving the enemy from J
Santa Mesa across the San Juan River in the capture of San Juan del Monte i
and the reservoir, and in driving the enemy over the intervening hills and J
across the San Mateo River, and the capture of the water works located, on .
that stream, ten miles from Manila. At this important point a part of the *
battery remained on duty for five weeks, being under fire nearly all the a
time, and assisting in repelling the frequent attempts to capture the pumping
station, so important to the troops and people in Manila. f
Battery B opened the fight at oaloocan on February 10. and did fine .
: service with their guns -throughout the battle. When Mac Arthur's division 1
began its northward movement, on March 24. the Utahs went with the J
brigades to which they belonged, taking full part in the fighting and capture
of Mariquina. San Francisco del Monte. Bakrai and Palo, winding up on the t
third day in front of Mlrejao. ,
They participated in the capture of that place the next day. of Bacave on J
the 29th. in the battle of Guigulnto on the 30tn and In the capture of Malolos, .
the Filipino capital; two days later. In :he advance on Calumpit. which f
began on April 24, Company A accompanied Hale's column byway of Quinqua l
in the advance on the north side of the Quinqua River, and the otherâ B â f
went with Otis' brigade direct from Malolos, both taking part in the almost fc
continuous fighting along the road and in the capture of Calumpit. *
When Mac Arthur crossed the Rio Grande and continued the movement *Â»
along the railroad to San Fernando, the Utah men. as before, were up in the ***
advance, and did good service on the march from Apalit to St. Tomas and "J
in the capture of the latter place, as well as at San Fernando just after. i
In the first days of the February fighting Sergeant Harry Young. Corporal **
J. Young and Private Wilhelm Goodman were killed, and two others were *J
wounded! and so on until the end of their campaign their way across the "J
Luzon hills and marshes was marked by the bloody results of fierce fighting. "J

i gos after that, and Lawton's junction
with Kobbe was rendered easy.
Lieutenant Webb was also with the de
tachment which discovered and wrested
from the Filipinos the body of assassi
: nated Dr. Young, the battalion surgeon,
i who was caught outside the lines and
i murdered by the Tagals. In the reports
! which came to this country the body of
Surgeon Young was said to have been
frightfully mutilated, but this impres
sion it is Lieutenant Webb's desire to
correct.
"The first indication we had that any
thing was wrong with him was when we
found one of his stirrups in the road,
: said he. "A mile or so farther on we
! found the body of ids horse with a big
\ blood stain on the saddle blanket. Two
j miles farther on we found his body. He
I had been shot and wounded and then
dispatched with a knife, which had been
: thrust in near his heart." .
Lieutenant Barron of Company D of the
! Nebraska* had the unique experience of
commanding an entire company through
one of the hottest fights of the cam
paign. His experience was unusual in
' that at that time he was plain corporal,
i but he made a hard and winning fight for
i all his modest rank, and he earned his
: shoulder straps because of it. Every
commissioned officer and "non-com" of
the company had either been shot down
I or prostrated by the terrific heat while
; the fight was at its hardest before Cal-
I umpit. and Corporal Barron, who is not
much bigger in years than in physique,
jumped into the command. Ho fought his
i company all through the engagement and
i was afterward recommended for gal
lantry In action and for promotion.
"After that battle at Calumpit," saiu
Major Killian. who likes to tell of young
; Barron's heroism. "there were only
I thirteen officers and 390 men of all the
l regiment who were able to report for
; duty."
Major Killian himself won promotion on
the other side by ids excellent work in
! the field. When he left Camp Merritt a
year ago be was the captain commanding
Company K. He has returned fourth hi
rank in his regiment.

SPLENDID RECORD
OF NEBRASKANS IN
BATTLE IN LUZON
THE .First . Nebraska Volunteers ar
rived in San Francisco May 19, 189S, j
the vanguard of the Eastern troops :
which were to form part of the- array
for the invasion of the Philippines. Dur- !
ing thei.- four weeks' stay In camp here !
they won general commendation by their
gentlemanly behavior and soldierly bear- |
ing. They sailed on the transport China
with the second military expedition on
June 15 and arrived off Manila. July 17.
On disembarking at Paranaque they '
were made part of General Greene's ad
vance", with which they continued, cheer
fully performing every duty falling to
th.-m, until the capture of Manila. j
The first American blood shed on Phil
ippine soil was drown by a Spanish bul
let on July 30 from Private William
Stirling, Company X of this regiment.
They opened the fight with the Insurgents
on the night of February ! last and bore
the brunt of the fierce attacks made by
the Filipinos for fourteen consecutive
hours, not giving back an Inch.
For the next ninety-nine days they were
in continual active service, marching
picketing and fighting, being only relieved
some days after the capture of San Fer- :
nando and the suspension of the pursuit
of General Luna's army, when there Was
less than 300 men out of the whole regi
ment fit for duty. They, took part in i
every engagement Incident to Mac-
Arthur's movementsâ twelve in all without I
counting skirmishesâ a total loss of I
over 80 killed and 223 wounded, among
the former being their gallant commander,
Colonel Stotsenberg, with six of his line

OREGON BOYS WELCOMED
Special Ssrv.'ces at Calvary I
Church Last Evfening for
the Webfoot Braves.
The boys of the Oregon regiment were
welcomed at the Central Presbyterian
Church, corner of Geary and Powell
streets, last night. The pastor, Rev. Dr. i
H. Hemphill, delivered a brief address In
which he stated that his belief was that
the soldiers came back better Christians
than they were when they left their |
homes to fight the battles of their coun
try. Chaplain J. Gilbert of the Second
Oregon Regiment followed with a retro
spective talk on the morale of the Oregon
boys during their stay hi Manila.
"Some of them went wrong In the
Christian virtues," he- said, "but I found
from investigation that as a rank and file I
they were true to the same moral princi
ples which guided them when they -.â .--:â .'
at their own firesides. I found that they
did not drink much, that they' gambled
very little and that they came. back, as
Dr. Hemphill said, better men than. when
they went away.'-' . , - - - .
A large congregation was present and
many uniformed Oregon boys were scat
tered, among those who listen,.,) to the
eloquent address of the chaplain.
The choir, consisting of A. St.. Lawrence ;
W. < '. Campbell and Misses Susie Hurt
Mark and Caroline Boyle rendered a
special programme of sacred songs and
patriotic choruses under the direction of
Professor J. Durness, the organist.
Knife Duels in Spain.
Knife duels are very frequent among
the lower classes of the cities in South
ern Spain. When two are about to
fight they blow whistles to attract spec
tators. Their left legs are tied together
at the knees, and then at a signal they
begin attacking each other with long
knives. In a duel recently witnessed

RECOGNIZED
The Badge, and the Horse Limped to
Its Owner for Belief.
"One reads so many stories about ani
mal intelligence that it would be hazard
ous for a doubter to express his disbelief
in almost any gathering of men at the i
Bent day," remarked a well-known I
Western physician to a Star writer re
cently. "A little Instance came within
mv own observation a number of years
ago when I was studying medicine that j
convinced me that the members of the
horse family should at least be credited
with the possession of a very considerable â 
amount of reasoning power. It was the
custom for the students at the medical in
stitution at which I- pursued my studies
to wear a small badge upon their coats to I
distinguish them from* others- at the Col- I
lege. A horse belonging to the establish
ment was used a great deal about the j
medical department., and the animal |
seemed to baveta special preference for ;
the embryo doctors. Well, one day while 1
a number of us were gathered in a little
circle upon a lawn In the rear of the col- ;
lege the animal in question, which used to ,
be turned loose to nip the grass in the lo
cality, came toward the group limping
very badly. He came to a stop a dozen
or more feet away from the crowd, and,
carefully, surveying the lot of us. finally I
made up his mind what he wanted to do, '
and without any hesitation limped direct
ly to my side, whinnied, stuck his nose
against my body and held up his left fore
leg, Looking down, I discovered. a large;
nail Imbedded in the frog of his hoof. This
had evidently caused the lameness, and I
soon realized the Interesting fact that the ,
animal desired me to attend to his foot.
I extracted the nail with some difficulty
and the horse whinnied with relief and
walked away. Being curious to .know why.
the beast had picked mo out to attend to ;
his wound. I glanced at my fellow stu-. |
dents and found the solution to the prob
lem. Not one of the group had his medi
cal badge upon his coat but myself. The I
horse had therefore plainly .recognized the
insignia and acted accordingly."âWash

GIANT POPLAR
Dies in Maryland at the Age of 1200 !
. â¢ â¢ â¢ Years.
The oldest and largest tree In Talbot
f County is dead, Â« It has been dying for
twenty-five years or more. The tree Is a
, mammoth tulip poplar in a field of Poplar
Hill farm, near the public road leading
from La-ton to Trappe. about a mile and
a half from Eastern. The farm lias been
i named for the tree for at least 200 years,
and is the property of Mrs. Edmund Law
Rogerg, nee Plater, of -Baltimore, and was
, part of the original Plater grant made In
early colonial times. Scientific men who
, have from time- to time- visited this tree
have said that It would take at least
1000 years for this species of poplar to
' grow to such a size In this locality. It
stands alone, a picturesque feature of the
. landscape, in an open field, and can be
seen for miles from all roads and from
the water courses. The wonderful size
of the tree is in the magnitude and height
-of its trunk. Approximately it Is 250 feet
High and 20 feet In diameter. The head Is
comparatively small, and the first limb
! is 200 feet from the ground, and it carries
Its diameter symmetrically all the way up.
â  From Its top, at night, for many venture
some and agile climbers have ascended
i It. the light in Sharps Island lighthouse
can be plainly seen. A horse and carriage
behind it cannot be seen from the nearby
; public road. The lightning has not spared
i it. It is seamed and gashed and split by
: the many bolts which have struck It, and
i which have also knocked huge limbs from
] Its top. Tradition says that 200 years ago.
'â  which is as far back as tradition claims
to have known the treeâ it Is named in
â  land deeds l.'O years agoâ lt had lightning
I marks on it, and even then showed signs
of failure. Three years ago it was Struck
four times in one slimmer. This fierce
: attack undoubtedly hastened Its end.
1 Well, the giant is dead. The old poplar
; of Poplar Hill probably saw the beginning
! of the tenth century and died just be
! fore the beginning of the twentieth. It

ACCIDENTAL DEATHS.
Startling Results From Innocent
Abuse of Familiar Things.
A strange case of accidental death is
recorded by the London Evening Stand- !
ard. A man went to bed excessively
drunk and was found dead in the morn
ing. â¢ The natural conclusion was. of
course, that he had died from alcoholic
poisoning, but the doctor who made the
post-mortem was not satisfied with this.
He examined the body and found over the- ,
region of the -heart a tiny hole like a pin
prick. On Investigating to find a cause
for this puncture [herd was found in the
mattress tin old rusty needle. The man
had gone to bed very drunk, and his cm
dition had prevented him from feeling the
prick. of the needle, which penetrated his
heart and caused death. ' â â 
Another accident equally remarkable
was caused by a snake of a harmless
species. A man was out shooting when he
saw a snake, and in order to stop it get
ting away he placed the butt of the rifle
on Its neck and thus pinned it to the
ground. Naturally the snake, objected.
and in its struggles to free itself colled
around the gunstock, one of the coils
striking the hammer, which was down on
the cap at the time, so forcibly that the
rifle was discharged. The contents . en
tered the man's chest and he was killed i
on the spot.
A third case of accidental death is that ;
of a man inhaling tooth powder. He
chanced to hiccough just as he was plac- i
ing a brush full of dry powder in his \
mouth. The dust got into his windpipe :
and formed a species of paste, Which
caused his death by suffocation ln a very 1
short time. _

Love may be blind, but it dictates a
lot of fool letters that sooner or later

ASPHYXIATED BY GAS
DIRECT FROM A METER
STRANGE DEATH OF AN UNKNOWN MAN.
AN unknown man was found dead yesterday afternoon under the steps of
the residence at 387 Geary street. He had been asphyxiated by gas
which escaped from the meter, but whether it was a case of suicide
could not he definitely ascertained.
The dead man was lying face downward, with his head resting on
his folded arms, within a few Inches of the meter from which the deadly
fluid was escaping. He had probably crawled through a narrow doorway
under the staircase some time Saturday night.
When J. P. Goldstein, who lives in the house, came home with his fam
ily at 10 o'clock Saturday night a strong odor of gas was discovered. Gold
stein made an Investigation and lit the gas all over the house. Not being able
to account for the odor, he finally retired and yesterday resumed his search,
when he was horrified to find the body under the stairs.
â¢ The Coroner was Immediately notified and the body taken to the Morgue.
The man was poorly dressed and is supposed to be one of the tramp frater
nity that infest the city. He had nothing upon him by winch he could be
Identified.
The leak came from the meter regulator which is used to determine if the
instrument ls ln working order, but whether the man simply crawled under
the stairs to sleep or for the purpose of committing suicide may never be
known.

story of the woman's attempt to destroy
herself. The officer questioned her, and, j
as she seemed determined to drown -her
sorrows in the Waters of the bay, he
took her to police headquarters.
Lieutenant Martin, after satisfying
himself that Mrs. Dunn had been drink
ing, ordered her locked up and a charge
of drunkenness placed against her. .
The woman is- the wife of Dr. Dunn, a :
well-known resident of Fresno. Some
time ago the physician commenced a suit
for divorce, alleging intemperance on the
part of his wife. Pending the hearing of
the suit Mrs. Dunn had been sent to a
private- sanitarium on Second street in
this city. Shorny after X o'clock last
evening she escaped from the sanitarium
and started out to drown her troubles and
herself at one and the same time.
Upon arriving at the foot of Fourth
street she removed her outer garments
and was about to throw herself into the
bay when she was discovered and turned
over to the police.
A short time after being placed In a cell
in the City Prison the unfortunate woman
pleaded with a trusty to give her a hat
pin. as she "wanted to sever an artery i
in her wrist." Falling to get the pin she
sunk her teeth into her wrist In a vain
attempt to accomplish her purpose. One
of her cellmates, seeing the blood gushing
from her wrist, summoned Corporal :
Hlckey, who quickly found the unfortu
nate woman still engaged In trying to
sever the main artery of her wrist with j
her teeth. After considerable trouble she |
was removed from the cell and sent to the |
Receiving Hospital, where a watch was
placed over her. .
It Is believed that the woman ls ment
ally deranged.
OFFICER HILL ARRESTED.
Overzealous Watchman Fires a Ran

Special Officer Hill, who is stationed at
Davis and Market streets, fired a shot
into. a crowd last night which is likely to
cause him some trouble. The Incident
occurred on Davis street about -past
10 o'clock.
, A hilarious party of merrymakers,
about sixteen in all, had just left Ltt

they had spent a decidedly pleasant even

Hill, who is one of worse's men, com

ensued, and at Its close Hill deliberately
fired into the crowd. - Fortunately the
shot hit the pavement, and by a miracle
no one was Injured. Policeman Stevens
promptly took the man Into custody.

Charges Against Two

FREIGHT TRAIN ROBBERIES
â â¦ â
SAID TO BE IMPLICATED WITH
WELL-KNOWN THIEVES.
â¢ â  â¦ * - ' ' ' : .."'-*>'
ICan in San Quentin for a Burglary
Said to Have Been Planned by
One of the Consta
bles.
A most extraordinary case of robbery
has been unearthed by Detective T. L.
Ryan of the local force and Special De
tectives Crowley, Maloney and Kindelon
of the Southern Pacific staff. Two con
stables of Contra Costa County are impli
cated and the matter will be laid before
the Grand Jury of the county, so that it
can be probed to the bottom.
On April 9, 12 and 14 freight trains on
the Southern Pacific route from this city
were robbed and articles comprising hard
ware, clothing, silks, cotton goods, hose,
corsets, brushes, leather goods, Worces
tershire sauce, handkerchiefs, scarfs,
overshirts, linen collars, black silk ties
and ribbons and other miscellaneous
goods stolen, including a box of tea con
taining 100 half-pound packages, a case
of brass faucets and a nickel-plated cork
puller. " â  '.. .
The Southern Pacific detective depart
ment, after being notified of the robberies,
soon ascertained that Joe Petancue, -a
young man who had been sent to the In
dustrial School from Oakland. Jo.- Wil
li is, alias "v.hitey," and "John Doe"
Rice, alias "District." were implicate in
the robberies. Williams is now serving
a sentence of two and a half years in
San Quentln for burglary In Crockett and
Rice is waiting his trial in Salinas for
burglary.
No trace of Petancue was found till a
few days ago, when it was discovered
that he had enlisted and was a casual at
the- Presidio. Late Friday night he was
arrested at the Presidio by Detective
Ryan; Special Detective Klndelon and
Sheriff Veale of Contra Costa County.
Saturday morning he was taken to Marti
nez by Detective Ryan. Sheriff Veale and
Special Detective Maloney and on Infor
mation given by him an application was
made to a Justice of the Peace there for
three search warrants. About five hours
were occupied in getting the search war
rants, and when the officers went to me
Saloon of Henry (Jambs, at Antioch, late
in the evening, where tin- property was
supposed to be, they only found the nickel
plated cork puller, and they have no hesi
tation in saying that owing to the delay
in Issuing the search warrants ample time
was given for the property to be con
cealed.
In the presence of Charles A. Sweeney,
a Constable and Deputy Sheriff of Contra
Costa County, and Gambs, the soldier,
Petancue, accused them of being impli
cated in the train robberies. He said that
his part of the robberies was to get on to
the trains, break Into the cars, and as
they were passing Antioch to throw out
the stolen property, which Sweeney, who
was provided with a horse and wagon,
was to pick up and take to Gambs' sa
loon. Both Sweeney and Gambs denied
any participation in the robberies, but
corroboration of Petancue's statements
was found In the fact that on the night
of April 14 Sweeney hired a horse and
wagon from Chase's livery stables at
Autloch and the horse answered the. de
scription given by Petancue. Further cor
roboration was found in the fact that
Sweeney had shipped through Wells-
Fargo's, Under the name of Davis, a case
of faucets to William Stultz, a plumber
on Seventh street, Oakland.
Gambs accounted for his possession of
the nickel-plated cork puller by stating
that he bought it from two young men
who dropped into his saloon. Petancue
said he gave it to Sweeney, and Sweeney
sold It to Gambs. '-* .
Constable Moiles of Crockett Is also im
plicated by Petancue from the fact that
he offered him and Williams and Rice the
use of his boat in connection with the ar
ticles stolen from the freight cars. Petan
cue also told an interesting and romantic
story about Moiles. He said that Modes
was an enemy of Chief Detective Crowley
of the Southern Pacific, and wanted the
train robberies perpetrated so as to bring
discredit upon Crowley and curry favor
with the Southern Pacific by notifying
them that he could lay his hands on tjie
robbers. Moiles also planned with Petan
cue and Williams that they should rob
Davis' general store at Crockett. The ar
rangement was that Petancue and Will
iams should break into the store, and
when they came out with their booty
_voiles and his brother would be on hand
and attempt to arrest them, which would
show that Moiles was conversant with the
perpetrators of crime in the county. This
was in the latter part of May. The plan
was carried out. but before breaking into
the store Moiles gave Petancue some
money an 1 a revolver. Moiles had noti
fied the he id clerk of the store that it was
to be broken into, but warned him to keep
quiet about it. as he wanted to capture
the burglars. When Petancue came out
of the store with his booty Moiles
put a revolver to his head, and Pet
ancue dropped his plunder. Moiles'
brother rushed at Petancue, but Moiles
shouted to him to let him alone, and
Petancue ran. Moiles fired six shots
at him. and the bullets came so close to.
him. as to be unpleasant. .
Moiles actually intended to kill him and.
drawing his revolver, he emptied It at
Moiles, but none of the shots took effect.
Meantime Williams had come out of the
store, and was captured by Moiles and
his brother, and for this he is now serving
two and one-half years in San Quentln.
Petancue went to Antioch after the
burglary and gave Sweeney two watches
that he had taken from Davis' store, and
told Sweeney that he wanted to get away
Sweeney gave him $3 and promised to
forward the watches to him at Sacra
mento, which he did, as verified by the
officers. After getting away Petancue
went to Colorado and recently came back
and enlisted in this city, as he wanted to
go to Manila.
According to Special Detective Malonev
Moiles was anxious to get a yearly pass
from the Southern Pacific, and early in-
May he spoke to Maloney about the train
robberies and notified him that another
was soon to take place. Malonev was
anxious to know his informant, but Moiles
declined to satisfy his curiosity There
were no other robberies. Â°
Petancue is now in the County Jail at
Martinez, and will be tried for the train
robberies according to his own confession
He is. a reckless youth. 23 years of age
and belongs to Oakland. He was on one
of the battle-ships during the tight before

LIVELY SCENE CREATED . BY A
NEW MEXICAN OFFICER.
â¦
He Visits "Russian Rosie's" House,
Becomes Unruly, and Threatens
to Kill Those Who
Offend Him.
Sheriff Blnckington of Socorro County,
N. ___:., evidently wants it known that ho
is a man who will not stand any foolish
ness. He arriveu here last Saturday with
E. W. Gentry, a supposed desperate train
robber, and after safely landing his man â¢
in the City Prison he started out to have
a good time all by himself. He visited
several Market-street saloons, and failing
to meet any adventure he asked to be di
rected to some place where he- could at
least display his prowess with a revolver.
One of wie men to whom he expressed
his desire advised him to visit a notorious
house kept by "rtussian Rosie" on Stock
ton street, near Sutter. '
"Just wait till you hear from me, re
maked Blackington. drawing two re- -
volvers and closely examining them. "If
they try any funny business on me some
body will go to the Morgue."
(_. few minutes later Blackington ap
peared at the house of "Russian Rosie ' *
and rang the doorbell. The servant who
ushered him in. concluding he was a hay
seed from his appearance, lost no time in
trvlng to make him feel at home. â '
â¢"'This Is a grand house, no doubt, re
marked the Sheriff from : New Mexico,
filing for his revolvers to see that he
had not been "touched" for them. Trot
out the landlady, I want to have a talk
"Russian Rosie" at this Juncture ap
peared and greeted the Sheriff with the
customary "glad hand." Â__,, , , __
"You're a peach, remarked Blacking
ton, taking a critical look at the mistress
of the house. "Be gosh, you d own
Socorro County if you were only there.
In order to make himself a good fellow
Blackington ordered a bottle of wine, in
some way he got the idea Into his head
that he was being played for a * 'sucker,
and with a wild whoop that could be
heard half a block away he drew his
"guns" and threatened to shoot everybody
In the house. The women, becoming
alarmed, ran from the house and sum
moned Policeman Purvis, who entered the
place and finally induced the bloodthirsty
Sheriff to leave. .
Sheriff Bhu-kington does not gainsay the
fait that he resisted an attempt to cozen
his wealth. ' , __Â_._,
"I went out for a racket." he said last
night, "and had an acquaintance with me.
We went to a certain placeâ l don't know
the street or number. I had reason to
think that I was being robbed, and I
stopped the game. I put two pistols on
the table and ordered all foes to leave the

QUEER TREES.
From Japan, and Other Curious Flo
ral and Arboreal Plants.
An exhibition of Japanese floral and
arboreal plants is being held at the
American . Art Galleries- - To. repro

decorations have been brought over,
! and some are very rare specimens,
many of them being the oldest in exis
tence. ;<** . * 'â -.â¢â¢ _h
Geisha girls, who came over with the
plants, pour tea in the garde:., the en
trance of which is like an old gateway,
decorated with old stone ornaments.
The trees are nearly all dwarfed, this
being done by clipping the roots. In
the collection are a number of ever
greens, ranging in age from 25 to 200
years, and most of them are trained to
the shape of Fusiyama, the Japanese
sacred mountain. One evergreen is re
puted to be 1100 years old, and the only
one of the kind in the world: it is only
10 feet high and weighs about a ton.
One of the beautiful specimens is the
chl-sho, or red maple: it is quite un
like any maple in this country having
fine, small leaves, and being of a deli
cate peachblow tint. It is nine feet
high.
One of the remarkable specimens is
a piece of mountain sponge about two
feet square, out of which there are
growing ten dwarf trees of different
varieties, such as pine, cedar, ever
green and juniper, some of them only
a few inches high. A curious and rare
specimen is the densiflora pine. The
Japanese, in the training of this tree,
have shown their usual love for re
versing the natural order of things:
the roots are nearly all exposed and
growing in the air, while the tree, in
stead of being- supported by the roots,
really supports the roots. The idea is
to see just how little root will keep the
tree alive, with the hope that in time,
by great cultivation, this tree may
flourish with barely a root. â New York

ALIMONY CEASES
At the Death of the Victim Who Has
to Pay It-
Justice Wiimbt.M; Smith of the Equity
Term of the Supreme Court. Brooklyn,
handed down a decision In which he holds
that a wife who has obtained an absolute
divorce from her husband, with alimony,
cannot enforce the payment of the ali
mony by his estate after his death.
The case under consideration by Jus
tice Smith and In which he made the rul
ing, was that of Annie E. Johns against
Henry W. Johns Jr.. Emily L. Johns and
Robert H. Martin as executors of Henry
W. Johns.
The latter, prior to his .death in IS!**,
was president of the Johns Manufactur
ing Company in New York, and was con
sidered wealthy. He married Annie E.
Johns, plaintiff in this action. In 1563. In
; 1882. she obtained a divorce from him. Mr.
Johns married again, and his former wife
was awarded $2400 a year alimony.
In 1898 Mrs. Johns sued the executors of
Mr. Johns' estate to compel them to set
aside a sum of money to secure payment
of alimony during her lifetime.
Counsel for Mrs. Johns, at the trial be
fore Justice Smith, cited the case of Go
lusha against Golusha, decided by the
General Term of the Supreme Court in
1887, in which it was held that the statu! .
as interpreted,, required the payment of
| alimony to the plaintiff after death.
Counsel In opposition cited the case of
Field against Field by the General Term
in ISSS. in which the- court held that ali
mony was an obligation resting upon the
husband and ending with his death.
Justice Simth is of the opinion that the
case of Field against Field la correct, and
i that alimony can only be obtained dur
| lng the husband's lifetime.
Destroyed a Chimney Without Tear-

Here is a novel and economical
method of destroying a large brick
smokestack. The stack was 266 feet In
height and 21 feet In diameter, and its
removal was accomplished in the fol

from one side at a height of about three
feet above the ground, and the opening
thus formed filled with built-up wooden
Mocks, between which were packed tar,
sawdust and paraffin. This material
was then set on fire, and caused the
chimney to crack and fall within a
space that had been previously marked
on the ground. Not only was the cost
much less than if the brick had been

DEWEY DID SAY
OUR NEXT WAR WILL
BE WITH GERMANY
Admiral Made the Assertion to
The Call-Herald Correspond
ent, and Does Not Deny It.
Special Dispatch to The Cell.
TRIESTE, July 30.â Admiral Dewey, when seen by a
representative of the Associated Press to-day regarding the
report of an interview published in a New York paper, in
the course of which the admiral is quoted as saying, "Our
next war will be with Germany." said: "I long ago gave
up denying or affirming newspaper reports."
Admiral Dewey remained on board the Olympia to
day, taking luncheon with Captain Lamberton, the com
mander of the cruiser, but afterward receiving United
States Consul Hossfeld.
NEW YORK. July 31.â The Herald
this morning publishes the following
editorial:
On Friday last Dr. Halstead Boyland,
a well-known physician, who sometimes,
when traveling, corresponds for the Her
ald in a dilettante way, sent the Herald
a dispatch from Trieste, which was pub
lished In our issue of last Saturday. It
gave a resume of a conversation which
Dr. Bpvland had with Admiral Dewey.
In this conversation the admiral spoke
with sailorlike candor, and expressed
opinions with regard to Germany that
have stirred up a commotion. It is per
haps regrettable that a friendly conversa
tion should have found Its way into print.
The admiral cannot regret it more than
the Herald does. Still, when this has
been recorded the fact remains that Ad
miral Dewey made the statements report
ed by Dr. Bovland; and even while depre
leatingI eating the publication of private opinions,
the hero of Manila is too frank and cour
ageous to trouble his head about what
the (Kaiser or the Kaiser's entourage may
think for the nut of the question is that
the German Emperor was rankly hostile
to the I'nited States during our war.
The Emperor's sentiments were not
those of atonic sympathy with another
monarchy. Th. were plainly, conslst
entlv inimical to the American republic.
Admiral Dewey expressed the full force
of the Kaiser's stubborn, dlvlne-righted
iv=s in Manila Bay, although he might
and probably would have preferred to
keep Ins opinion of the German potentate
te. himself. He has expressed it. and is
ready to stand by it. The I'nited States
has nn quarrel with the German nation.
There are no more loyal citizens ln this
republic than the contingent of German-
Americans, as they are wrongfully called.
for an American citizen is an American
citizen and nothing else. owes no al
legiance to any other state, no matter
where he may have been born.
No. the United States has no grievance
again=t the German people, but it has a
serious one against the German Emperor,
with his antiquated theories of hereditary
prerogatlves and military supremacy. The
sooner the Emperor learns that militarism
and peace nre Incompatible the better it
will be for him. â¢ The sooner he appre
ciates that. whatever his views about re
publics in general may. be â and he would
be well advised in observing strictly a
neutral position so far as regards the
I'nited Statesâ the less danger there will
be of his "divine right" receiving a severe

TERM BEGINS
THIS MORNING
Six Weeks' Vacation
Is at an End.
â â¦ â
BIG ATTENDANCE EXPECTED
â â¢ â
WEBSTER PUPILS ARE ALL
TAKEN CARE OF.
The Normal School Opens August 14.
The Faculty Appointments Will
Be Made This Evening at
Trustees' Meeting.
The public schools will be reopened this
morning after a vacation lasting six I
weeks, and for a few days confusion will !
reign supreme until the various classes
have been organized for the year's work, j
What with assignments and reassign- 1
ments of teachers, the transfer of pupils ;
from the primary grades to grammar and
from grammar grades to the High School,
It probably will be nearly a week before
school work will be taken up in earnest. j
The abolishing of the Webster School
will necessitate the distributing of eight- .
ten classes, comprising some four hun- |
dred scholars. Six classes will pro to j
Whittier. seven to Lincoln and five to |
Jefferson. These three schools have the!
nt-cessary vacant classrooms, and they
will be utilized for the purpose. Lincoln
School, which heretofore has received
boys only, will henceforth be devoted to |
both boys and girls. * <
It has not as yet been decided what |
will be done with the condemned Webster j
School. It may be demolished and the
site be given over ;o other purposes, cr
an additional story may be added and
the structure rented The Board of Edu
cation is desirous of making the property
income-producing. The proposition to â 
abolish the Le Conte School at North '
Beach, which came up at the last meet
ing of the heard, will depend entirely on
the attendance, but It is thought that the I
district is so thickly populated that It j
will be impossible to get along without
it An increased attendance in all the
schools is looked for by Superintendent
Webster and the abolishing of any more
schools is not likely to happen at least ;
tor the present. . !
The Normal School will open on August
14 It Fred Burke, who was recently
appointed president of the school, will j
appoint the other members of the faculty j
at a meeting of the San Francisco Nor- ,
mal School Trustees, to be held this even- ,
ing in Trustee Dinkelspiel's offlce In the i
Claus Spreckeis building. These appoint- I
ments must be ratified by the board. Dr.
Burke is a well known educator, and was i
for several years Superintendent of .
Schools at Santa Barbara. . r . â¢lJ , i
At the last joint meeting of the Normal ,
School Trustees held in Los Angeles It
was decided that to enter the Normal
School in this city it will be necessary for
the applicant to possess a high school i
certificate. This will be disappointing
news to many, as heretofore a grammar
school certificate was sufficient to admit. |
Spain strikes a cord in entire harmony
with that which was sounded throughout
this country when Dewey was facing the
Spanish enemy at Manila. Every act in
that brief drama told us that he was not
only facing an enemy, but was also lying
alongside the ships of a personally un
friendly sovereign. Our admiral with rare
good Judgment avoided a clash by wise
discretion, and no one who recalls what
was said in the American press at the
time, and was heard right and left upon
the streets, but realizes that Admiral
Dewey's opinion expressed to our corre
spondent at Trieste echoes the sentiment
of the whole American people.
WILL NOT BE MET
BY A SQUADRON
WASHINGTON, July 30.â Since Admiral
Dewey started from Manila \ for New
York it has been repeatedly suggested
that the North Atlantic squadron should
be sent out to meet him and escort him
to American waters. Secretary Long has
repeatedly denied that this would lee
done, and it is probable that the Olympla
will be allowed to come to New York un
attended.
TO BE ENTERTAINED
BY THE PRESIDENT
WASHINGTON, July 30.â President
McKinley will give a reception to Ad
miral Dewey at the White House when
the latter arrives in Washington. At
first he was in doubt whether a recep
tion or dinner would be more appropri
ate, but the former is likely to be de
cided on for the reason that it would
be more popular in character and j
would grant to a multitude of people
an opportunity to meet the naval hero
and shake hands with him.
Later on the expectation is that a,
dinner also will be given to the admiral
at the White House, and this, fed
lowing the usual custom, will be a
festivity of some elaboration. The
Vice President and Mrs. Hobart, mem
bers of the Cabinet and their wives and
some others will be invited. The ad
miral is expected to come to Washing
ton very soon after reaching New York.

STANFORD MEN
HELD AS SPIES
BY BRAZILIANS
Members of the Branner Scien
tific Party Detained Twelve
Days at Pernambuco.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, July
30. The scientific expedition that
left Stanford University last May,
under the direction of Professor
John C. Branner, to explore the
coral reefs along the eastern coast of
Brazil, was met and delayed for a
time by unexpected obstacles in its
way by the Brazilians. Upon the ar
rival of the scientists in Pernambuco,
Brazil, they had difficulty in getting
their outfit through the custom house,
and for two weeks after their arrival,
they were kept under close surveillance
by the authorities, who mistook them for
Government spies of the United States.
They were in constant danger from
violence from the natives, who regard
ed them with open hatred.
The story of their trouble is told in
letters recently received from C. E. Gil
man, a member of the party, who
writes under date of June 14:
To-day we start on our cruise among
the reefs and Islands. We could not start
before because we were held here a week
as Government spies. This Government
got the Idea that we came to find a suit
able landing for American men-of-war.
It has been quite exciting for the last
week. They finally allowed us to tele
graph, which we did, to Rio de Janeiro,
and Mr. Bryan, the American Minister
there, finally persuaded the President to
let us go. So this morning we start after
a week of polite guardianship by the offi
cials and menacing threats by the dagos
who make up this city.
Further details in regard to their de
tention and its causes are given in a
letter of date June 20:
Must tell you about the trouble we had
In getting away from Pernambuco. About
two months ago the United States ship
Wilmington ascended the Amazon Rlvjr.
She asked for permission, but as the
Brazilian Government took no notice of
it she went up without it. This caused
this nation great excitement. It had been
Insulted and wanted revenge. Then the
Montgomery came here and photographed
an old Dutch fort. This same fort is rot
ten and of no earthly use and had to bor
row powder of our ship and mount an oid
gun to return our salute. Brazil imme
diately declared that the United States
was mapping Its coast, photographing its
defenses and then would make war upon
them.
About a week after this we landed at
Pernambucco. The customs officials seiz
ed on our arms and collecting outfits,
cameras compasses, etc. For twelve days
we were held as Government spies, and
it took the Consul, the American Minister
at Rio de Janeiro, the President and the
Cabinet to get our stuff safely on board
the ship. How the people hate us! They
are always trying to scare us by draw
ing their knives.
Letters from other members of the
party tell the same story with addi
tional Information that what Brazil
feared was that the United States and
Bolivia had entered into an agreement
to appropriate a portion of Brazilian
territory, and that the Branner party
was there to select suitable landing
places for troops. This rumor gained
wide circulation and belief and inter

ment of Generals Pellieux and De
Negrier, and declared that a parlia

ernment. He said that the republic was
responsible for all the evils of the last
quarter of a century.
The Matin announces that there is no
case against Colonel dv Paty de Clam,
and this announcement has since been
confirmed by M. Menord, Colonel dv
Patv de Clam's counsel.

FIRE DESTROYS FRUIT.
Burning of a Warehouse Causes
Heavy Loss at San Jose.
SAN JOSE. July 30.â A fire that caused
a loss of about $40,000 in fruit, ware
houses and dried prunes broke out at 3:15
o'clock this morning near the brozjd-gauge
depot In this city. The building in which
the fire started was the warehouse of J.
B. Inderrelden & Co. of Chicago. The
structure was destroyed, together with
about forty carloads of prunes, the loss
being $30,000: insured for $25,000. The heat
melted the corrugated iron warehouse ad
joining, belonging to Lee Brothers. This
building was empty, the loss being about
$3000; insured for $2000. Freight cars val
ued at $8000 that could not be moved on
account of the rapid anu hot fire were
burned. The origin of the fire is un

national complications seemed immi
ment. The rumor was officially denied,
but the Brazilians did not believe it,
claiming that certain denials of the
United. States in the late war. with
Spain were not true, and asserting that
this was another case of unfaithful
ness. Vigorous action on the part of
the American Minister at Rio de Jan
iero finally obtained for them permis
sion to continue their scientific work.
After the delays were overcome, the
work of mapping and studying the
coral reefs progressed steadily and suc
cessfully and that on the reefs from
Pernambuco northward to Cape St.
Rogue, has been completed.
The members of the party are in the
best of health. There is some talk of
their returning to the United States by
way of Cape Horn and the Pacific, and
they expect to be back at Stanford
about the middle of September. .
Besides having been detained as
spies, the party has met with a num
ber of exciting adventures and has had
a variety of narrow escapes. When
its ship crossed the equator on its way
south, according to ancient custom.
Neptune was to come aboard and initi
ate those who had never crossed the
line before. The six Stanford men.
however, did not relish the idea of mak
ing the close acquaintance of his
Oceanic Majesty, and when he put in
his appearance the six joined hands,
and, giving the Stanford yell, rushed
Neptune and his bodyguard. The old
fellow had never before stood up be
fore a football line and his party broke
and fled. The Stanford men were then
granted their diplomas without under
going the usual humiliations.
Some of* their observations on Brazil
ian life and customs are Interesting.
Pernambuco is exactly the same slow
old town it was twenty-five years ago.
Some of the English residents are try
ing to introduce the bicycle, but the
natives look at it with fear and hatred.
Recently a young Englishman was
knifed while riding in a secluded, back
street, where the natives were not used
to the "Infernal machine."
One curious custom is that of firlnjr
off a number of great bombs each
morning from the cathedral plaza to
awaken the particular saints to whom
the day is dedicated.
While in Pernambuco the scientists
were in the midst of a lively fight be
tween the local police and the soldiers
who were stationed at the theater to
keep order. The leading lady, it seems,
gave more of her smiles to one party
than to the other, and the jealous party
pitched into the others and soon the air
was cleft by machetes and the palms
of the plaza were riddled with bullets.
The Americans speedily got out of
harm's way.
The party intended to make an ex
tensive collection of natural history
specimens for the museum, but has
been prevented thus far because it can
not use firearms, not even pistols, with
out running the danger of attracting
the natives, who on the least provoca

â â
Assassins Make an Attempt to
Seize the Body of the Late
President Heureaux.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
KINGSTON, Jamaica. July 30.â A |
private cable dispatch received here by
way of Cape Haytien reports that the
revolution in San Domingo is pro
gressing favorably. The dispatch says
that the real reason for the detention
of President Heureaux's body at Santi
ago was that the country between San
tiago and Porto Plata is occupied by
the Insurgents, who, abandoning their
plan of occupying Moca as a base of
operations, are concentrating to attack
Porto Plata, which is feebly garri
soned.
Great excitement prevails owing to
the fact that the Government has not
been able to ascertain the extent of
the ramifications of the revolution,
"which is growing demoralized through
the death of the President.
In the event of the revolution suc
ceeding, according to the private cable
gram it is probable that Jiminez and
Jltones. the reputed leaders of the revo
lution, will agree to retire, offering the
Presidency to Maximo Gomez, who
would prove acceptable to all parties.
A deputation, it is reported, is going
to Cuba to confer with General Gomez.
PUERTA PLATA, San Domingo. July
30. â The situation is critical. An out
break is momentarily expected. The
friends of the Government are under
arms and ready (or action to protect
property and peace. A feeble attempt
was made to seize the body of Presi
dent Heureaux by the assassins, Ramon
Caceres, Manuel Caceres, Horacio Vas
quez and Domingo Pichardo, who are
in the country about Moca. with their
Mowers.
The burial of President Heureaux
was conducted with fitting honors. Gov
ernor Pepin has assembled troops in I
Moca and the Governor of La Vegareal
has 1000 men. The Minister of the ;
Treasury has arrived at Moca in hot
haste. The Government is taking steps
for the protection of the business and
the finances of the country and expects
to earrv out the contemplated cancella- I
tion of the State bank notes. In Puerta {
Plata there is an urgent demand that i
the Government send a sufficient force i
to Moca to hunt down the assassins of !
the President.

ITALY'S UKASE
TO THE PLANTERS
Terms on Which Labor

SUCCESS OF THE CO-OPERATIVE
SYSTEM.
-Â»
Hawaii Threatened With a Financial
Crisis Owing to Over-Specu
lation in Shaky-
Stocks.
HONOLULU. July 23.â The Italian Gov- j
ernment has apparently take a stand j
which, according to the Planters' Asso- j
ciation, will probably put a stop upon the
endeavors to procure Italian labor for the |
' sugar plantations.
The Government practically demands
j the following arrangements:
A bonus of $100 to be paid to the family
of each laborer in the case of disable
ment during contract, or, if the contract
is fulfilled, then at the end of the con
tract.
Half pay during sickness.
A dollar a month extra wages to the
head of the family for each child under j
working age.
A garden lot for each family. â 
Boys from 12 to 15 to receive employ
ment at 2."> cents a day.
Two pay days a month.
A fully accredited agent to act for the j
planters, In addition to the two now ac- j
credited to the Government.
The Italian Government, if these terms j
are agreed to. will permit a trial ship
ment of 250 laborers; but the planters
say they cannot accept th.' second condi
tion, requiring half pay during sickness.
And again, according to our school laws,
children must attend school until 15 years
old. This ultimatum is a surprise to the j
planters, and they feel Inclined to aban
don the proposition.
That plantations can be successfully
conducted on the profit-sharing business,
even with Portuguese; Chinese and Jap- j
anese as the principal participants, and j
without any contract laborers, is already
shown by the success, among others, of
the Koua Sugar Company on Hawaii. ]
Here some 300 men are cultivating the cane |
for the mill on shares. The system is
simple enough, and insures profit to the
mill and a good remuneration, in com
parison with contract labor, to the labor
ers or partners. The lands are rented on
a profit-sharing system; the mill fur
nishes the land, seed can.', plows, teams
and Implements, and makes advances, if
necessary, for food, etc.
The mill then makes and cells the sugar
and divides the profits after deducting
advances with interest at a rate of from
7 to 9 per cent and the oust of manufac
ture. The agreements between the' parties
are' generally made for five years, but :
vary in duration. White men have joined
; in the work and they receive five-eighths
'. of the profits, leaving the rest to the mill;
There is great diversity of opinion as to
the feasibility of this plan being generally
I adopted for large plantations and with
| purely American or white labor, as there
! are many who hold that the only solution
| to the labor problem is higher wages and
better accommodation and treatment.
The labor question, however, is an old
i one rind will drift as it is until the Amer- :
| ican form of government is fully estab- j
1 lished, when the necessity of the case will
| develop a remedy. A problem, however, '
of far more importance has arisen In.
connection with the development of the
plantations and especially the new ones.
j A very conservative financier says i .at
I within the next eighteen months th3re
must be found no less than $8,500,000 for
assessments on companies already in t..e I
market, without taking into consideration
those only projected. This week there has
been quite a slump even in gilt-edged
stocks, for the poorer classes of investors
\ have over Invested and have had to re
alize on some to save the rest. Planters
are, in fact, living on one another with j
a cannibalistic mania, and the weakest i
go t.i the wall.
Fnless the capitalists can bring in a con- j
siderable amount of foreign money there
will be a crisis before long which will aid
the very rich, but crush a large number
of the poorer and foolish investors who
would not listen to conservative advice.
I The financial atmosphere will be purified
at a terrible cost, but the lesson will be
I thrown away in the rush for sudden
wealth.
STILL SAYS THE YOUTH
ARE OVEREDUCATED
Huntington Explains His San Fran- ;
cisco Speech to the Industrial
Commission.
CHICAGO, July 30.- A special to the
Chronicle from Greenville, Term., says:
* Collis P. Huntington has written a letter
to Judge V. AY. Grubbs. chairman of the;
State committee of the Industrial Com
mission, explaining bis recent speech at
San Francisco, wherein he said the youth
of the country were being overeeducated.
Mr. Huntington says that education Is
not armful in Itself, but the generality
of young men spend too many of perhaps
the most valuable years of their life In the
schoolroom. . The mass of boys, he de
clares, by carrying their education be
yond the point required to enable them
les, carrying their details busi
i the point required to enable th"m
ope with the pracUcal details e.f busl
ness gain a positive distaste for labor
that does not come under tho head "gen
teel," and as a result young men are
crowding into poorly paid places, where
they <]<Â» not have to soil their hands or do
manual labor, and good chances for pro
motion go begging In many cases.
This condition of things, he says, is cu
rious, and must be explained before the
present system of educating young men in
this country can be called successful.

IMPORTANT DISCOVERIES
â â¦ â
A THOROUGH STUDY OF PRINCE
WILLIAM SOUND.
â¦
Splendid Collection of Rare Birds and
Mammals Made New Glacier
and Fjord Named After
Harriman.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, July SO. â The Harriman â 
Alaska expedition returned here to-day
on the steamer George W. Elder. The
expedition, both from a scientific and
pleasure point of view, was an entire suc
cess. A journey of over 9000 miles was
made. The party left Seattle May 31. It
sailed northward through the- inside chan
nel, stopping at Victoria, Wrangel and
Juneau, reaching Skaguay June 6. From j
here the members of the expedition went j
over the White Pass to the headwaters of |
the Yukon. Returning to Skaguay, they i
sailed for Glacier Bay, where several j
days were spent studying the glaciers and
making collections. Sitka was visited the
next day. 'i iiree days were spent examin
ing the old town, climbing some of the
neighboring mountains and making col
lections. From there the party steamed to
Yakutat Hay. going to the extreme hheatd t
of the bay and examining and mapping .
the glaciers about it. Several days were '
devoted to an exploration of the little
known Prince William Sound, whose deep j
fjords and mighty glaciers have never be- i
fore been seen. â¢â¢
After the completion of its worktherethe |
party proceeded to Cook Inlet, and later, '
on its way westward, a party of scien
tists was left on the Alaskan Peninsula at
Kukak Bay, North Kadiak Island, to
make collections on that peninsula, which
up to that time had never been visited by !
naturalists. Kadiak and Wood islands
were then visited. The Fourth of July
was celebrated while the steamer was in
the" harbor of Kadiak.
From there the route was westward via
the Shumagln Islands, where a party of
naturalists was lett until the return of the
vessel. Passing through Unimak Pass into
Bering Sea to Unalaska, they visited the
Pribilof Islands by way of Bogoslof vol- I
cano, and then into Plover Bay, in Si- I
beria. From Plover Bay the party crossed ;
to Port Clarence', on American soil, and
from there went to St. Lawrence Island,
on the way steaming around King Island
and later visiting hall and St, Matthew
islands; returning to Seattle over much
the same route followed on the journey
northward.
During almost the entire trip line
weather was enjoyed. There was not a
single storm, und comparatively little
rain or fog. The health of the party was j
good throughout.
Large collections were made in verte
brate and invertebrate zoology, and in j
botany, geology and ethnology. Many
birds ana mammals hitherto rare were
found in considerable numbers, and it is
altogether probable that many new Inver
tebrates are included among the collec
tions made. j
The geographical results of the expedi
tion are considerable and important. Sew j
waters were entered and explored and j
many new glaciers discovered, studied
and mapped. An extensive fjord hitherto j
; unknown and a splendid glacier run- â 
j nlng into it at its head were named
! by the geographers of the expedition utter
Mr. Harriman. The geologists had many
opportunities of studying the rocks and
' of investigating the action of glaciers. J
It was found that most of the glaciers .
â  which have hitherto been known and ex- |
plored are retreating. j
Little hunting was done, for the time
was chiefly devoted to the gathering of
scientific, material. Moreover, the game
at this season of the year is usually found
back from the coast. i
From Siberia and also at Port Clarence j
the Eskimo were found in their primitive
condition, living in huts made from the j
hemes of whales and covered with skins, i
and traveling ln boats of skin. At Port j
Clarence 'a great number of them had ,
â¢ gathered to meet the whalers which were
lying there awaiting the arrival of the
supply ship, then overdue. Several of the
whalers had already provided themselves
; with natives and dogs for their long j
I cruise into the Arctic. ;
'1 be expedition visited all points as orig
! Inally planned, and in addition made the 'â 
, trip through Bering Sea to Siberia, and
was in all respect^ successful. Several
| thousand photographs were taken, and
these will be a revelation of magnificent
scenery even to those who have seen the !
better known portions of Alaska. With
unusual good fortune unobstructed views ;
j were had of both St. Ellas and Fair
weather ranges.
The study of collections brought back j
i will occupy not only the specialists of the I
expedition for a long time but many oth- j
ers throughout the country, and the re- j
j sults are certain to he of great scientific 1
' interest.
Much of the success of the expedition
, is attributed to the excellence and equip
; ment of the steamer Elder, .and A. L.
Mohler, president of the Oregon Railway
and Navigation Company, is given great
j credit therefor. Countesies from the Pa
cific Coast Steamship Company, the White
Pass Railroad Company and the repre
sentatives of large commercial companies
| In Alaska are acknowledged.

MANILA, July 30.â The insurgents
made an unsuccessful attempt this
morning to recapture the town of Cal
amba, on the shore of Laguna de Bai,
which the forces of General Hall cap
tured last Wednesday afternoon. The
rebels numbered 2400 men. The attack
was made simultaneously from the
north and south, the Filipinos appa
rently thinking they would confuse the
Americans by attacking from two
points at once. â¢'â¢'
It was not even necessary to employ
the whole American force to drive the
Filipinos oft". Two companies of the
Twenty-first Infantry, a squadron of
cavalry and one gun sufficed to repulse
the attack from the north, while the
400 men of the Washington Regiment,
comprising a part of Hall's command
and a detachment of cavalry, drove off
the rebels who had advanced from the
south.
The loss of th"** insurgents is not
known. The American loss was one
killed and seven wounded. Despite the
condition of the country, caused by the
recent rains, the enemy is active.
The Signal Corps has laid a cable
across Laguna de Bal from Calamba

Will No Longer Be Gen

NO CLASH IS ANTICIPATED
both Mckinley and ROOT
want HARMONY.
â¢
Believe That the Bickerings Which
Have Distinguished the War
Department Will
Cease.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WEL
LINGTON HOTEL. WASHINGTON,
July 30.â General Miles has every rea
son to believe that he will now be
something more than commanding gen
eral in name only. It has been stated
that General Miles is preparing his"
case and that when the new Secretary
takes office on Tuesday he purposes to
demand his rights. This is not true.
He simply intends to resume his former
duties under regulations. In this way
it will devolve upon Secretary Root to
raise any question concerning General
Miles' duties and responsibilities, and
not the general.
Miles does not expect anything but
harmony, nor does Mr. Root. Mr. Mc-
Kinley insists upon it. I understand
that at a conference between the Presi
dent and General Miles, the day before
Alger resigned, the desirability of more
pleasant relations between the major
general commanding and the head of
the War Department was emphasized
and assurances were given that Gen
eral Miles would receive better treat
ment in the future.
There is no doubt that one of the
causes which led the President to seek
Alger's resignation was the petty jeal
ousy shown by the latter toward Gen
eral Miles. Before Miles' departure for
Santiago, on his way to Porto Rico.
more than a year ago, the President did
all he could to prevent a rupture be
tween the two officials, but General
Miles was discouraged at the repeated
tiling of his recommendations and the
general treatment he had received from
Alger, and the latter was angered by
the criticisms of his administration by
General Miles.
Since the return of General Miles and
his famous declaration concerning the
shortcomings of the War Department,
he lias held only perfunctory relations
with the Secretary of War. The new
Secretary has already been requested
by the President to give General Miles'
recommendations ancl views careful
consideration.
On his part, General Miles will be
expected to aid the Secretary in r.t'.min-
Istering the affairs of the department
and dealing with the military situation
in the Philippines.
Adjutant General Corbin is too much
of a soldier not to obey the President's
wishes. His friends point out that, al
though it has been repeatedly asserted
that he is not friendly toward General
Miles, he has maintained pleasant offi
cial relations with that officer, notwith
stand his loyalty to Secretary Alger.
With a tactful man like Mr. Root at
the head of affairs, it is believed by offi
cials that the bickerings which have
distinguished the War Department dur
ing the last year will cease.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, July 30.â The morning papers J
all devote space to the closing of the
Peace Conference. The Standard says:
"It must be a source of pride to Russia
to know that she carried with her. In
agreeing to all the conventions, declara
tions and resolutions, a majority of the
nations represented. True, the minority,
which makes important exceptions and
reservations, includes such powers as
Great Britain, the United States, Ger
many. Austria, Japan and Italy. Still
Russia, can console herself with the sup
port not only of France, Belgium, Bolivia
and Bra J, whose opinions on such topics
as the laws of maritime warfare and the
limitation of the caliber of naval ordnance
and pattern of rifle bullets must carry
weight even if they conflict with the
British admiralty and German war office."
The Daily News says: "The* chief work
was, of course, the definite unanimous as
sent of the assembled states to arbitra
tion as a substitute for war. The Pope's
letter, too, must have an excellent effect
upon Roman Catholic countries, and Prot
estants will read it with with feelings of
highest esteem for the aged Pontiff, who
in language worthy of his station ac
knowledges the duty of the church to pre
serve the peace of the world."
W. T. Stead says in the Dally News:
"The American delegation has been one
of the most useful elements in the parlia
ment. If the old traditional policy of
America had been construed with such
severity as to forbid the presence of
American delegates at the international
gathering the world would have been the
loser. Andrew White, its chief, held him
self much in the background, but did not
spare effort privately to bring about a
good understanding between the repre
senttives of the powers.
"But the man of the American delega
tion who left much the deepest mark upon
the conference and its work was the
American lawyer, Mr. ll. dis, secretary of
the delegation. Mr. Hulls was compara
tively unknown before the conference, but
it had hardly come together before his
energy and his determination compelled
all his comrades to feel that he was one
of the strong men of the conference.
Owing to his appointment on the commit
tee d'examen he was able to play a much
more conspicuous role than any other
American delegate and he made the very
best use of this opportunity. Apart trom
the article Introducing the special media
tion, which bears his name, he was
chiefly instrumental in introducing the
principle of revision into the arbitration
convention. In this he was ably seconded
by Seth Low, whose exceptional abilities
had unfortunately little opportunity for
exercise. But nevertheless he impressed
his colleagues very favorably.
"Captains Mahan and Crozer made
hosts of friends and stuck to their duties
manfullyâ one stuck to his
asphyxiating shells and the other to his
expanding bullet with a resolution and
pertinacity which commanded the admi
ration even of those who opposed them."

SpÂ«c!al Dispatch to The Call.
BOISE, Idaho, July 30.â of the
biggest quartz discoveries in the his
tory of the State has been made on
Badger Creek, which empties into the
Boise River, about three miles this side
of Twin Springs. The discovery was
made by a prospector named Frank
Bryant at a point on the creek three
miles from its mouth. News of the
strike reached Boise yesterday evening
and created a distinct sensation in min
ing circles. A large number. of people
at once struck out for the scene of the
new discovery and others will go to
day.
It is understood that R. K. Anderson,
manager of the Twin Springs Com
pany has taken option on thirteen of
the claims for his company, which em
braces the best locations. He has had
ten assays made which run all the way
from $50 to $133 a ton. One pound of
ore from the original discovery yielded
$30 in gold.
The new discovery is only about forty
miles from Boise. By this time a
swarm of people, who heard the news
here last night, are on the ground.
The important discovery covers two
veins, which are about 6 feet wide at
the surface and only 300 feet apart,
running east and west.
In the south vein gold predominates,
and from it the most of the samples
were taken for assay. In the north
vein silver predominates,- but it also
carries a large percentage of lead. The
assays show an average value of "-0 per
cent lead and 50 ounces of silver to the
ton. It is the gold vein, however, that
caused the sensation.
News from the Seven Devils is to the
effect that the Iron Dieke mine, belong
ing to the Northwest Copper Company,
has shut down with its employes in
possession. For three months there
has not been a pay-day and the men
employed in the mine concluded to take
possession of the property until such
time as they would see the color of
some pay.
Two guards were placed over the
property in the day and two at night.
For an extra precaution the men drill
ed a hole in some rock near the mine
and loaded it with powder. This they
intend to touch off if any attempt is
made by the management to regain
possession of the mine as a signal to
the rest to fall into line. A clash is ex
pected any time.
MAY HAVE BEEN MURDERED.
Nicholas Furlong's Body -Found in
the Bay Near Port Costa.
PORTA COSTA, July 30.â body of
Nicholas Furlong was found floating in
the bay near Port Costa this morning.
Furlong was last seen alfve at 2 o'clock
Tuesday morning, when he was walking
along the wharf near the ferry slip. That
the man met death by falling into the
bay seems hardly probable, for he had
been working along the water front be
tween Port Costa and Crockett for the
past seventeen years and was thoroughly
familiar with every foot of the different
wharves between those two points.
There is an ugly gash on the right side
of Furlong's head and from the fact that
the body came to the surfce so quickly
leads many of his friends to believe that
he met with foul play. :
Furlong leaves a widow and son resid
ing in Vallejo.

Special Correspondence of The Call.
BY HORACE^ WRIGHT.
HONOLULU, July 23.â The volcan i j
of Mokuoweoweo still contin
ues to be active, and old flows j
give place to new. The latest j
reports are that there is no ap
parent fear for Hilo. as the main !
streams appear to be diverting from
the main track to the port and touching j
more to the north In the direction of j
Kalaieha on the side of Manna Loa, and j
then turning westward toward Kohala. i
The Call's correspondent writes to me j
from Hilo that for the past few days it i
had . been impossible to get even a
glimpse of the reflection from that city i
until Â«en Thursday evening, when the!
dense smoke, which had been hanging j
over the whole of the east coast, cleared j
away and a magnificent view of the
glow was had.
From th Volcano House a grand i
view of the display of fountains from
the volcano is enjoyed by the hundreds
of visitors. Through a telescope or
even by the naked eye can easily be
seen the vast columns of lava, being
thrown from the center of the crater
high up into the air to fall again upon
the side of the cone and rush madly j
down its sides in fiery columns. These j
fountains vary from 200 to at least 500
feet in height,* and though almost thir
ty miles rom the Volcano House are,
plainly visible.
[f it is not within the compass of peo
pie te. visit the actual crater itself â and
the journey and climbing require strong
Constitution and nerves -those who-are j
able should not hesitate to get as near j
te. it. as the Volcano House, for the
climate is simply grand, and there are j
many points of interest even to those
who have previously visited Kilauea. |
From Kilauea vast clouds of smoke I
are continually arising and it is so hot I
on th- lava bed, near the crater, that it
appears to be very likely that there will
shortly be a flow from there, for
through the cracks near the mouth of |
th--- crater can be seen the redhot lava |
flowing in the interior.
CHANGE IN THE COURSE
OF THE LAVA FLOW
KALAIEHA, Hawaii, Humuula I
Sheep Station. July 19.â A very great
change took place in the course of the!
lava flow last night. Ever since the !
flow began, July 4. the course of the
principal stream of lava has been from
the highest active cones down the j
mountain nearly due east, past all the j
sources of lava until it reached and j
partly crossed the flow of ISSO. Then it i
turned abruptly to the north in the di- I
rection of Kalaieha on the side of j
Ma una Loa. It spread all over the side j
of the mountain, occupying an area al- I
most a mile wide. This -v.-'-* the condi- j
ion of things last night.
Sometime during the night the first
part of th- stream, that flowing east- ]
ward, broke through its bank about Â»
half nay from its source to where it.
turned northward, and formed a new j
channel running northward down the
mountain parallel with the old channel :
but further west. This is carrying the
lava less directly toward Hilo, and
keeping it nearer the ridge which di
vides it from the slope off In the direc
tion of the Kohala coast.
KALAIEHA! July 19.â Will E. Fisher
ar.d E. S.Gregory started for the spout- j
ing cone Monday morning, seeking to
reach it by following up the course of
the flow from its foot at this point.
Gregory returned this morning for a I
fresh supply of water to take back to j
Fisher, who had become exhausted and
was obliged to spend the night on the;
rocks. They found the way so difficult
that they were able to get within
several miles 'if the cone and were â 
obliged to turn back.

NEWARK. July 30.âWe had a
break down to-day on the road
out of Auburn, which we left nt
6 o'clock. The spindle of the in
let valve snapped and made it
necessary fo run on one cylinder into
Phelps. There was a gas engine shop
there, and we stopped to have the de
fect remedied. We were advised to
have a different valve set in. and it took
the entire afternoon to accomplish this
and we started at 7 o'clock for Newark,
Intending to make an early start to
morrow morning and a long day's run.
The motor is working evenly, and if
there are any more breaks it will be
due to causes that can be entered Into
in detail. The roads to-day have been
very heavy, the sand and hills making'
travel hard and especially so on one
cylinder. The run to Newark was very
satisfactory and one cyclometer shows
thirtv-flve miles done in three hours

LESSONS DRAWN BY
REV. FATHER WYMAN
Father 11. 11. Wyman occupied the
pulpit in Ft. Mary's (Paulist) at tin- 11
o'clock mass yesterday morning and dis
coursed in his usual forcible style. lie
dwelt on the eleventh chapter of St. John.
"He groaned in spirit and was troubled."
In part he said:
To-day, my dear brethren, we celebrate the
feast of St. Martha, and I think I cam bet
tor show you how great she was in the ever
of God than by calling your attention Lo the
visit of our Lord to her when he raised her
beloved brother from the dead.
The gospel tells us thai our l--'l was so af
fecteel hy the death of Lazarus that he
groaned In spirit and wept We might natur
ally ask ourselves why he should grieve over
the death nt one he was about to raise to life
again. The reason is because he ha.l human
sympathy fee:- his friends in their affliction and
had to weep with those who wept. Further
more, he saw the effects of sin In death and
remembered that his own death for the life
of others would be accomplished. We see in
this sin both our Lord's humanity and his di
vinity. Mary had said: "Lord, If thou hadst'
l,^o n here mv â  roth would not have died
She then recognized his divinity a? well as
his sympathy. He chose in a special manner
to show forth his divinity by commanding that
Lazarus should come forth . rom the tomb.

CHIEF LEES AND
THE AUTOMOBILES
Rev. Frederick C. Lee of the California

castically commented last night on Chief
Lees' desire to have automobiles assigned
to his department for use in carrying crim
inals and drunks to and from prison in a
prelude to his regular Sunday evening ser
mon, entitled, "Chief Lees on Wheels."
After calling attention to the alleged un
faithful services performed by the aged
head of the local police department, the
minister commented on the Chief's at
tempt to gel the autocars as follows:
"The Chief has been somewhat modest,
Inasmuch as he has not specified the par
ticular 'motor' he prefers; whether he
wishes it to work with a "push' or a 'pull'
, gear. What a sight to make the ferry
clock hide its face and the man on the

A WARM ATTACK
ON SPIRITUALISM
Rev. E. Nelander preached a sermon on j
"Spiritualism: or. King Saul at the
: Witch's Cave". last night to his congrega
; tion at the First English Lutheran
Church. Following are a few extracts
from the sermon:
Paul was a spiritualist. I do not say that
there is no truth underlying* this form of
falsehood. But 'for the so called "spiritualism"
! of these times we can have no feeling but of
contempt and abhorrence. Suppose that our
departed dead could communicate with us, j
would ti-.ee.- go to entire strangers, to people :
with whom when living they would not as- j
sociate and tell to social outcasts the most
sacred things, which, if they were living, they ;
would tell in no car but- ours? Th.- very
thought of such a possibility Is degrading tJ
the memory of' the sainted .Wei.
Dr. Wilson on Colonel Ingersoll.
Rev. John A. B. Wilson, pastor of the
Howard Methodist Episcopal Church, ad
dressed a large congregation last night on
the passing of Colonel Ingersoll. The doc
tor commented on the career of the
famous agnostic, sketched his early train
ing and drew lessons from his life. The
sermon was an Instructive one and was
listened to with deep interest by those
present.
Lecture by Mrs. Mattie A. Bridge.
"Social Breakers" was the theme- of a
lecture delivered by Mrs. Hattie A.
Bridge at the First Christian Church, on
Twelfth street, last night. Strong drink
and Its dire effect on the home and social
world was pictured by the speaker in lan
guage which admitted of no misgivings.

NEWPORT NEWS. July 30.â There ;
are thirty cases of what is believed to
be genuine yellow fever at the Na- i
tional Soldiers' Home, near Hampton, ;
and three deaths from the disease were \
reported to-day. There were several
other deaths at the institution yester- j
day, but it cannot be stated to-night
that all of them were caused by yellow |
fever. Newport News and Hampton j
I will quarantine against the Soldiers'
l Home to-morrow morning.. The Gov
ernment authorities at Old Point have j
| already adopted this step and no
! strangers are allowed to enter the res
j ervation.
Quarantine Officer Hobson of this
port went to the Soldiers' Home to
| night and verified the statement that
there are now thirty cases of the dis
: ease at the home and that there were
! three deaths from the malady to-day.
, While no one outside of the Soldiers'
Home knew anything of the existence
I of yellow fever until to-day. it is said
that the disease made its appearance
â  three days ago. The most rigid quar- j
antine regulations will be enforced to
prevent the- spread of the malady.
The news has created great excite
ment in Newport News, Old Point and
Hampton and the most vigorous meas
ures will be resorted to to prevent its I
spread. There are four thousand vet-'
erans at the- home and several large
excursion parties vent there last week.
WYMAN AND STERNBERG
ARE INCREDULOUS
WASHINGTON, July 30.â Surgeon
General Wyman of the Marine Hospi
tal Service was informed Saturday
night of an outbreak of v. hat was fear
ed to be yellow* fever at the National
Soldiers' Home, at Hampton, Virginia,
and immediately dispatched surgeons
in the service from Wilmington, N. â¢'..
Norfolk and Washington to investigate
the sickness there, report on its char
acter to the authorities here and to
take measures to prevent the spread
of the disease. Dr. Wyman himself
will go to Hampton in a few days to
take charge of the work of preventing
a spread of the disease if it develops
Into genuine yellow fever.
Two of the surgeons dispatched to
the home reported to-day that the
symptoms very much resembled those
of yellow fever, and that while they j
would not be positive in their diagnose j
as yet, they were Inclined to the belief I
thai the disease was the dread yellow j
jack. The Government will light its
progress with all the skill anil re- I
sources at its command.
Surgeon General Sternberg of the j
army declared to an Associated Press j
reporter at a late hour to-night that he j
has no official knowledge of the report
ed outbreak of yellow fevÂ»** â¢â < j
Hampton. He expressed himself as
highly Incredulous of the truth vi I lid j
story, saying he had no intimation even
of the question of the fever at Hamp
ton. Still, he said, he might not get
the earliest news in such cases, as re
ports probably would be first sent to
the members of the Soldiers' Home.
PRECAUTIONS TAKEN BY
NORFOLK HEALTH BOARD
NORFOLK, July 30.- Th" Board of
Health has quarantined against Old Point.
Hampton and Newport News. Police offi
cers have been sent out along the water
front to watch for tugs, sailboats and
other craft. There is much excitement.
Governor Woodfin of the Soldiers' Home
confirms the report of the existence of
fever there. Hampton has been quaran
tined from Old Point, and the trolley cars
stopped running to the former place to
night.
"Agnosticism" His Subject.
Rev. D. V. Bo wen addressed his con
gregation at the First New Jerusalem
Church yesterday morning on the subject
of "Agnosticism." He said:
"Agnosticism is a term used to set
forth a form of scepticism. Its funda
mental principle is that all knowledge
should be restricted to phenomena which
are capable Of being apprehended by the
senses. In the new- church it is allowable
to enter with the understanding. So the
word agnosticism has no place here. The
new church does claim to know and to be
able to give a reason for its faith."

ORDER CHOSEN FRIENDS.
During the past week Covenant Council
at Georgetown had work in the initiatory
degree and Ocean Gem Council- at Ocean
View received three applications.
Last Friday night Pacific Council of
this city was visited by the grand officers,
including Grand Councilor Savage, who
gage car, combination and buffet car
and two Pullman sleepers were piled
up on the tracks immediately in front
of wrecked freight cars.
The first sleeper was split into two'
parts as the result of the accident and â¢
the passengers were thrown thirty feet
down a bank. Fire at once broke out
and four cars of the express train, and
nine of the freight cars were burned.
Baggagemaster Becker, who found j
himself under the baggage car door,
recovered consciousness only to dis- '
cover that he was all alone in that part
of the wrecked passenger cars. He
managed to crawl from his position
only to lind a blaze starting in front of
him, while half of the cars were some
how braced up immediately over him. I
He called for assistance but there was
no response. Then he saw the passen- |
gers, who had been hurled down the i
thirty-foot embankment, endeavoring
to extricate themselves from the debris j
and make their way up the bank. All |
were clad only in their night clothing
and they were shivering with the cold,
some were bleeding and moaning and
all were dazed.
Members of the train crew com
menced to search different portions of j
the wreck and assisted those who were |
struggling to- escape. Blankets were j
brought in from the Pullman cars and
wrapped around shivering women and j
half-conscious men.
Word was telegraphed to Port- Jer- j
vis. A relief train was at once arrang- i
ed for and Dr. Cudeback, Dr. Swwirtout,
Dr. Johnson and several traine" . Urses
returned for the purpose of caring for
those needing immediate assistance.
The relief train soon reached the scene
of the accident and nearly all of the In- !
jured persons were removd to the hos- ;
pital.
Of the persons injured and now at I
the hospital, Bernard Shay of New Port i
Jervis, the engineer of the freight train,
and G. E. Betz of Cleveland are most J
seriously hurt, but their wounds are
not fatal. Mr. Betz is a stenographer j
in the office of Traffic Manager Thomas i
of the Erie system. i
Several thieves from Port Jervis. who |
it is supposed reached the scene of. the
wreck on the relief train, ransacked 1
the clothes of the passengers during I
the period of excitement. F. View, a
milliner decorator of New York, lost j
clothing containing $300 in bills and a i
gold watch. F. S. Kilpatrick of Denver j
lost $100, a gold watch, a diamond pin |
and a diamond stud. On the way to |
the hospital he noticed a man wearing:
his trousers. They went through the
pockets together but found the money
gone. The man said the trousers had
been given him by one ofr the train- j
men, but claimed that the money and
valuables must have been abstracted
before he received the present of the
garment. , '':-]_ â -'â â â 
After several hours' search the bodies

NEW BELLAMY COLONY.
A Community From Which Lawyers
and Ministers Will Be Barred
George 1 1. Webster, a grocer of Nashua,
N. H.. is organizing a Bellamy colony.
Lawyers and preachers will be barred j
from membership. It will be located |
either in New Hampshire or .Massachu- I
setts. A committee has been appointed to i
select a site. Two colonies of Shakers I
at Shirley Village. Mass.. are about to
unite, and Mr. Webster hopes to obtain
One of their locations.
"I am a Socialist," he said. "While i
communities are not exactly a part of
the socialistic scheme, I believe In them I
thoroughly. I have been studying the |
subject for four years, and the idea ; of i
organizing a Bellamy colony in this city
originated with me. I started the move- j
ment about two months ago, and we have
gone so far as to appoint a committee- to
find a suitable site. The movement is |
not confined to Nashua people by any ;
means. It looks as though all New Eng- I
land and many of the Western States j
would be represented in the list of char- i
ter mem be 1
"The cost of stock lh the company is a |
matter on which I have figured a *-;â  >â  >< i I
deal. I think we shall place our shares I
at 1300 each. Possibly we may cut it I
down to $200. Bach charter member will j
j own one share of stock and no more. It's
right here that our colony will differ from 1
the Bellamy colony at Ruskin, Term.
! "There a share of stock costs $500. It ;
Is constantly increasing In value as the â¢
property of the community increases, and j
a man who goes in -day gets less for i
his money than a man who goes in next
fall and more than a man who went in
i last fall. 1 am trying to devise some
; sort of a plan to equalize the thing. -â¢'..:
"Each member will be required to de- |
! posit his money when he joins tin- colony. I
| We must buy land an.l the raw material [
for building houses, for each man in this i
community' will own a house and enough
to live on until we can raise our own
produce, if there Isn't enough money i
am willing to loan the colony . $1000 or
more without Interest, and l presume
there will be others in it who can and
will do the same thing. .: ;- -
"After we are on our feet we shall de
vise senile plan so able-bodied men can
come in without cash capital. We can't
do it on the start, though. Each member
of ill.- colony will have his house and his
board given him. For his labor he will
be paid In time cheeks, and the price of
all commodities sold by us to our own
members will be reckoned in hours.
"No money will be used between the
members, and of course everything sold
them -will I"- sold without profit at the j
actual cost."
Size of the Ocean.
. An observant man once remarked '
that most men seem to he as ignorant
about the size of the sea as they are of I
the distance between the heavenly
planets Here are a few facts: The Pa- ;
cific covers 68,000,000 miles, the Atlan- '
tic 30,000,000. and the Indian Ocean,
Arctic and Antarctic. 000,000.
To stow away the contents of the Pa
cific it would be necessary to fill a tank
one mile long, one mile wide and one '
mile deep every day for 440 years. Put i
in figures, the Pacific holds in weight
948.000.000,000,000,000,000 tons. The At
lantic averages a depth of not quite \
three miles. Its waters weigh 325,000,
--000,000.000,000 tons, and a tank to eon- |
tain it would have each of its sides j
430 miles long. The figures of the other -,
oceans are in the same startling pro- j
portions.
It would take all the sea water in the .
world 2,000,000 years to flow over Nia
gara. A tank to hold it would have to
measure nearly 1,000 miles long each of
its sides.â The Rival. . '
MISCELLANEOUS.
THE CURE OF
CONSUMPTION
Has Been Reduced to a
Science by Br. Aborn oi
554 Sutter Street.
After an absence of many years spent in
the East and abroad Dr. Ale. has re-
turned to this city and resumed the prac-
tice of his specialties at .v.4 Sutter street.
Dr. Ale.::' won considerable distinction
while here in 1869 and.in the early seven-
ties by his remarkable cures of Consump-
tion. His experience of many years in
other cities has enabled him to develop to
a marked degree his new treatment of dis-
eases of the head, throat and lungs. Dr.
Aborn's treatment gives immediate relief,
builds up and revitalizes the whole con-
stitution, fortifies the system against
colds and catarrhal affections, and by
preventing consumption prolongs life.
Dr. Aborn was greeted on his arrival
here a few weeks ago by several of his old
patients, all of whom he had rescued from
untimely graves. In numerous Instances
where consumptives were given up as
hopeless cases by well-known local physi-
cians Dr. Aborn succeeded in effecting
permanent cures and adding years of
health and happiness to the lives of the
afflicted. In his treatment of nasal ca-
tarrh, asthma and all bronchial affections.
Dr. Ah. an's efforts have been attended
with unusual success, artd in numerous In-
stance the cures effected by him were of
a brilliant character.
Dr. Aborn has spent over thirty years of
his life in the study and treatment of con-
sumption, catarrh, asthma, throat dis-
eases and all affections of the lungs, so
that to-day he is recognized in medical
circles as an absolute authority on all
questions pertaining to these subjects. his
Offices at 554 Sutter street have been
thronged since his arrival and each suc-
ceeding day adds to the number and bril-
liance of his achievements.

HALCYON TIMES IN TRADE.
GENERAL trade continues without especial fea
ture. Conditions established long ago still
prevail; and from one shore of the country to j
the other there is but one report of continuous pros
perity. The bank clearings for the past week showed
a gain of 43.2 per cent over the same week in 1898,
and Milwaukee and Buffalo were the only two cities
of importance to exhibit a falling off. The failures '
were 151, against 225 for the corresponding week in
1898. This story is repeated with such unvarying mo
notony week after week that it no longer excites re
mark We are getting so accustomed to prosperity ,
that we accept it as a matter of course.
The staples have not abated a whit of their firm
ness. Lumber is firm and the demand is so active .
that building operations are reported hindered in con
sequence. Dry goods continue in active fall demand, ;
and woolens are also moving off well. The manu
facturers arc purchasing wool more freely in conse
quence of the improved call for the manufactured
product. Cotton goods are stronger as a rule, in
spite of cheap cotton, and the market is in fair shape, 1
The leather market is characterized by a scarcity of
stock, and at Chicago a combination of packers has
advanced the price of hides so that many tanners are
leaving that market. Boots and shoes sympathize
with the firmness in leather and hides, and the ship
ments in July were the heaviest ever known. The.
iron industry continues to make a brilliant showing.
Though the output of pigiron during the first half of
1899 was the heaviest ever known it was insufficient \
for the immense demand, and the stock on hand to- j
day is less than it was on the first of the year, or even I
Et this time last year. In addition, the product for the j
last half of the year is said to be all booked. The
glass trade is also in fine condition, said to be the best
for many years. And thus it goes, all along the line.
Conditions in California, like those in the East,
remain unchanged. With the exception of hay all
farm products are in good demand at remunerative
prices. While grain is not high, the quotations, tak- I
ing the cereal markets as a whole, are above the nor
mal, while the demand is generally good. Fruit is !
still bringing fancy prices, and the usual midsummer
glut in fresh fruit is not as pronounced as usual, owing
to the enormous shipments to the Eastern markets,
â which have removed much of the surplus. The can- j
ring demand is also sharp, and much of the output j
rf California canned fruit was sold to the East and ;
Europe before the fruit was ripe. As for the dried
product, the fall prospects are brilliant, quotations for :
most descriptions being high, with promise of a fur- |
ther advance later on. It may be years before we j
have another such fruit year. Hops are in active re- J
quest at fine prices, but the growers are generally re
fusing to sell. Wool keeps up and is very firm, while
the livestock market is all that could be desired by
the most exacting stock raiser. The activity in pro- '
visions continues and every few days there* is an ad- j
\ance in something or other.
Wholesalers in general merchandise report a steady
and active business, and there are no complaints about
profit margins. The export trade of the port is lively
and exporters are still complaining of the dearth of
vessels to carry away the goods. A further advance
in lumber sufficiently indicates the state of this indus
try. In short, business is now what it ought to be:
active, without undue speculation, with prices which
admit of a fair and sure profit. These are halcyon
times in trade, and we should make the best of them,
for commerce, like man, has its periods of elevation
and depression, and the wise man makes hay while
the sun shines.
The dispatches declare that Governor Gage has
"rebelled" against his master Burns. It is more than
_. probable that the wrong word has been used and that
a kick judiciously placed will land his Excellency back
in the traces.

Count Castellane's ability as a yachtsman seems to
be on an equality of failure as his craft as a conspira
tor. He very easily lost the first race for the French
cup. - -
THE REIGN OF LAWLESSNESS.
ON Thursday last, at Wallace, Shoshone County,
Idaho, Paul Corcoran was convicted of mur
der in the second degree for having associated
himself with a thousand miners., some of whom on
April 29, 1899, destroyed property at Wardner and,
in connection with that crime, killed a man named
James Cheyne. \ .
This simple fact proves that the ordinary adminis
tration of the law was amply sufficient to deal with the
situation produced at Wardner by the mob which
perpetrated the outrage, thus partly redressed, and
fully justifies the comments of The Call upon the reign
of terror established through the co-operation of the
civil and of the military authorities. In the first in
stance, in order to overawe and control so large a
body of men, only a portion of whom seem to have
been actual participants in violence, there probably
was sufficient excuse for temporary military interfer
ence. But it is now quite apparent that the declaration
and the maintenance of martial law, the censorship
over the press and the telegraph, the arrest of hun
dreds of citizens without the formality of accusation
or warrant, the exertion of undue pressure for the
production of testimony, and all the other arbitrary
proceedings that have been so widely criticized
throughout the country, were absolutely without pos
sible justification or palliation.
The deeper and more alarming condition, how
ever, that the proceedings in Idaho illustrate, is the
growing -prevalence of lawlessness throughout the
United States. Believing, as it does, that the Republi
can party, especially in these days of socialistic fusion,
represents Americanism fn its highest sense, The Call
has persistently maintained the inherent rights of citi- â¢
zens and insisted upon the administration of our polit
ical system in strict conformity with fundamental law,
as interpreted and applied for nearly a century and a
quarter. For years the breach between capital and
labor has gradually widened and there have been pre
monitory symptoms of disturbance that could only
be met by that equality before the law which, in the
centers of political corruption, has come to be treated
as cant. But after all there is a balance in our insti
tutions and a self-adjusting element in- our people
fully commensurate with any exigencies that existed
before our war with Spain, and, which, it may be
added, will most likely be adequate to control existing
and new complications.
The situation, however, is dangerous and perplex
ing. Coincidently with the development of imperial
istic tendencies, contempt for the law has enormously
increased. Thomas Babington Macaulay more than
fifty years ago predicted that, before the end of the
century, there would be bread riots in New York.
This prediction has not been literally, but it has been
substantially, verified. A brief allusion to a few of the
incidents that have transpired within the last few
months will induce serious reflection and may result
in strengthening the public opinion that rules this
continent more effectively than any other part of the
civilized world.
The lynchings that have been so prevalent in the
Southâ in both the Carolinas, in Mississippi, in Geor
gia, in Texas and in other States where the equilib
rium between the whites and the blacks is barely
maintained â rest on their own peculiar ground. The
outrages that provoke them and the lynchings them
selves are evidences of lawlessness suggestive of a
race antagonism and of a race problem that ought to
produce some hesitation among the advocates of Ha
waiian cheap labor and of the conquest of the Filipi
nos. The worst feature of these departures from law
and order are the insecurity they establish in the lo
calities where they occur and the injury they inflict
upon popular government. The United States has
already paid an indemnity to China. It is now about
to acknowledge the legality of the claim for the lives
of three Italians summarily taken at Tallulah, Louisi
ana. These experiences are valuable, because they
show that, by universal recognition, law is the essence
of civilization.
But the most significant breaches of that discipline,
without which great populations cannot live together
in harmony and in prosperity, are those which involve
our white citizens and result from the intense antag
onism of labor against capital. It has been recently
observed by the Iron Age of New York that the
slightest pretexts are seized upon as a justification for
strikes and that labor is both scarce and uneasy. In
dustrial and capitalistic unions, held within the just
limitations of the law, are equally unobjectionable.
Their policy is one thing â legality is quite
another. Associated capital, in some of its forms, has
sought to control legislation, to influence the courts
and to rule the national policy. Imperialism, to the
extent to which it really exists, is a product of this j
tendency. The accumulation of money, by honest
means, is not merely proper but laudable. This truth
is almost universally admitted among American citi
zens of all classes, including the preponderating num
bers in labor organizations. But capital, employed
corruptly, works silently, insidiously, remorselessly
and without force except when it needs military as
sistance, and, even in those emergencies, it usually
keeps within the technicalities of the law. It thus pro
vokes coarser violations of peace and of order. Lat
terly almost every strike, even against the protesta
tions of its leaders, has been accompanied by violence.
The public is becoming familiar with the use of dyna-
I mite, with attacks upon property that harm the inno
| cent more than the guilty, with a state of menacing
j exasperation that necessitates relief.
The examples of these propositions are too numer
ous and too recent for recapitulation. New York,
1 Ohio, Illinois and Kansas are among the most impor
! tant. In Illinois and in Kansas the attempt to substi
| tute negroes for white laborers added fuel to the fire.
I In Cleveland the strike for a brief period almost as
i sumed the proportions of an insurrection. It is true
; that these insubordinate exhibitions have been thus
far suppressed. But they have been most destructive
; in the actual injuries and losses they have entailed and
'. most serious in the evidences they supply of deep-
I seated rancor and of disregard of the protection to life,
! to liberty and to property that is the core of the Amer
ican system of government.
Philosophers, political economists, statesmen and
! journalists may speculate as they please upon this im-
I peded but spreading reign of lawlessness. The remedy,
however, is intelligible, simple and just. It is merely,
; the equal enforcement of constitutional obligations.
Imperialism and all other revolutionary projects that
I represent greed and rapacity must be abandoned.
[ Capital must be restrained from fraud and labor from
' the forcible exercise even of its legal rights. The
: Government, in all its phases, must be administered
'. upon an American and not upon a European founda
tion. These are the prescriptions that, if applied, will
I reach and extirpate the disease that has become almost
I epidemic in the country and place American citizens,
j without distinction of class or position, upon the basis
I of legal equality
B GLANCE AT $ CRITIC.
A LITERARY agnostic, monopolized by the Ex
aminer, devoted a long article yesterday to a
criticism of the views of The Call upon the life
and character of the late Robert G. Ingersoll. It
THE SAN FJR AN CISCO CALL, MONDAY, JULY 31, 1899.
would be useless to point out his failures or refusals
to comprehend the meaning of his pared and carefully
selected quotations from the article he attempted to
dissect and of the nature and of the functions of the
syllogism. One example, however, may be men
tioned. The Call assumed that belief in fraternity
was inconsistent, with the denial of the existence of
God. The deepest reasoners of this age and of former
ages, representing all shades of religion and of irre
ligion, have unanimously conceded that universal
brotherhood necessarily involved the existence of
universal fatherhood, and, therefore, of God. The Call
takes no sides on this question, but, under both the
inductive and deductive systems of reasoning, is
forced to acknowledge the inference or the illation
from the assumed premises.
The manner of the criticism is peculiar to its writer.
For many years, in his numerous controversies, when
expressing his opinion of the other side, the ass has
been his favorite simile. In. fact, his compositions
have largely increased the interest in that useful do
mestic animal. Whether in the instance before us. he
had in his mind the renowned ass of Balaam, which
spoke words of wisdom and tried to prevent that tem
porarily deluded prophet from making a fool of him
self, we are unable to determine. But there are some
facts about the ass that it would be apposite for him to
recall. An ass rarely loses his temper and never acts
under dyspeptic influences. An ass is distinguishable
from a mule, so far as judgment is concerned, by the
circumstance that it seldom kicks, but when it does it
always hits. Another peculiarity of the ass is that it
is the most successful diplomatist among animals and,
in tact and in acumen, easily surpasses many human
critics. The bray of an ass sometimes appears out of
place, but it frequently destroys the gravity of a
situation and it is quite as coherent and louder and
more effective than the subdued roar that occasionally
projects itself from within the skin of a counterfeit
lion.
OUR UNRIVALED NEWS SERVICE.
ONCE more The Call has demonstrated the
superiority of its news service over that of all
its contemporaries and competitors by being
first to give information of great importance and of
world-wide interest. The demonstration was accom
plished yesterday by the exclusive publication of the
report of the Samoan Commissioners on the condi
tion of affairs in the islands and the steps that have
been taken to establish a stable government.
This news affects the interests of three sreat nations
the United States, Germany and Great Britain â
and is a matter of concern to all who have dealings
with the commerce of the South Pacific Ocean. The
attention of the world has been for a long time di
rected to the Samoan Islands, and, as is well known,
the crisis there at one time threatened to interrupt the
friendly relations of the three powers. Such being
the case all intelligent men have been eager to learn
what the commission would do, and all great journals
that make any pretense to legitimate news-gathering
have been on the alert to get the information as early
as possible.
The success of The Call in this, as in other cases,
is due to the fact that while it expends neither money
nor energy for fakes, it spares neither to obtain reli
able news from all quarters of the globe. A gaudy
fictitious interview with the Pope, the Emperor of
China or the Ahkoond of Swat, is easily concocted,
i and requires little expenditure of either brains or coin.
but to be first in obtaining information concerning
great events is a different matter. The Call has re
peatedly accomplished successes in that way widen
; fully attest its superiority as a legitimate news-gath
! erer over all rivals.
FLOURISHING, BUT MENACED.
SECRETARY WILSON in the course of an in
terview published in The Call yesterday gave
some very gratifying information of the rapid
advance of the sugar beet industry in the United
j States. In. the course of his statement he said:
"Last fall we had nineteen factories in the entire
United States for the manufacture of beet sugar. This
fall we will have fully fifty. They are being built in
the States of New York and New Jersey for the most
part, though there are some going up in other States
as well. One is in progress of construction in Minne
sota, one in each of the Pacific Coast States, one has
been completed at Ogden, Utah, and another is now
going up at Grand Junction, Colo."
As an illustration of the extent to which the industry
can be expanded in this country without exceeding
the present demand for sugar, the Secretary went on
to say: "We bought 18.000,000 tons last year. That
is about the total amount produced in Germany. The
purchases we made were contracted for in Germany,
France, Belgium and Holland. To offset the neces
sity for purchasing abroad and to produce all that
would be needed for consumption in this country
would require the operation of about two hundred fac
tories, which could be built at an average cost of
about $500,000 apiece. It would require from one mil
lion to one million and a half acres on which to grow
the beets."
That is certainly a splendid outlook for American
agriculture and American capital. To cultivate 1.500,
--000 acres of land and to construct and to operate 200
factories at an average cost of $500,000 each means
a great deal of work for a great many men. Unfor
tunately over that flourishing prospect there is the
menacing cloud of imperialism. Secretary Wilson did
not call it a cloud, he did not call it imperialism, he
did not call it a menace. Those words are ours, and
must not be attributed to him, even by indirection,
but the Secretary said:
"As near as can be ascertained by sending an agent
to the Caribbean Sea Islands it costs tne people of
those places 2 cents per pound to produce their sugar.
Where the pulp from the factory is wasted or fed to
cheap steers, it costs the people of the United States
about 3J4 cents per pound to get their sugar from
the beet, the returns depending in a great measure
on the disposition that is made of the pulp."
In that statement we have a revelation of a menace,
though the Secretary does not call it so. If by a fool
ish imperial policy we annex Porto Rico and Cuba
in the Caribbean Sea and add to them the Phil
ippines, where labor is cheaper still, and admit the
product of their labor to our markets, how can this
flourishing agricultural industry continue to thrive?
With raw" sugar costing about 2 cents a pound
brought from the Philippines and from the islands of
the Caribbean Sea, where it has been produced by
what is virtually slave labor, the sugar trust, the great
sugar refineries can continue their operations, but
what will become of the American beet grower and
the factories established to refine the product of
American fields?
There may be a profit in imperialism to somebody,
but there is none in it for the American farmer or the
American workingman.

BIG CALIFORNIA
MINING AFFAIRS
Big mining enterprises are appearing
pretty rapidly these days In California
amid the host of smaller operations in
the way of buying, bonding, prospecting
and developing new and old mines, the
constant formation of new companies, the
rustling about of agents and promoters,
the awakening to new life of old mining
camps and the planting of fresh ones
amid ore-ribbed hills.
The sale last week of the great and
famous Mariposa grant," in Mariposa
County, to London capitalists is the big
gest and best thing announced in the Cal
ifornia mining world in a good while, and
it will make Mariposa County leap for joy.
The expenditure of a large amount of
money in prospecting and developing the
mining properties of the estate will fol
low. The sale means new life to Mari
posa County and t.he development of sev
eral producing mines.
This magnificent estate, a principality
in extent and richness, comprises about
seventy square miles, or over 44,000 acres
of territory, irregular in shape and with
the town site of Mariposa, the county
seat, inside of it. It was originally ac
quired from Mexican grantees by John C.
Fremont, the pathfinder. Fremont lacked
capital and the estate had a hard financial
career for many years. It finally passed
to the joint ownership of Senator J. P.
Jones of Nevada and his brother, _->
Jones, J. AY. Mackay, Alvinza Hayward
and his partner Hobart, whose share be
came part of the Hobart estate. These
owners composed the Mariposa Mining
an.l Commercial Company.
Valuable mines were developed on it in
early days, and $4,000,000 was taken out of
the Josephine, which was never opened
below 600 feet. Other valuable or promis
ing mines on the estate have been the
Pine Tree, Princeton, Mariposa, Mount
Ophir, Texas, Lewis, Ludwig and Georgi
ana, besides a large number of other pros
pects partly or slightly developed. Put
there has been no production or develop
ment work worth speaking of on any or.
the mining properties of the estate for
over thirty years. The millionaires who
last owned it let it lie idle from year to
year. It is said that Mackay and Jones
wished to exploit the property, but the
other owners would not join in putting up
the money. _
Besides the splendid mineral possibili
ties and promises, it is magnificently tim
bered and watered, with a considerable
area of agricultural lands. It has for
many years been looked upon as a prop
erty with a splendl future. During all the
long years that it has lain nearly as un
productive as when the Indians roamed
Its forests it has been the incubus of Mar
iposa County, which has hoped and wait
ed for the coming of moneyed redeemers.
About two years ago the Exploration
Company of London bought Alvinza Hay
ward's one-sixth interest, on the basis of
$1,000,000 for the entire property. It stood
ready to take all the rest at that valua
tion but the others would not sell. Ham
ilton Smith and H. C. Perkins, well-known
Californians who have been successfully
operating In London, South Africa and
elsewhere for years, and Thomas Mem
of San Francisco engineered the deal.
and, with London investors, put tip the
money in unknown proportions. Messrs.
Smith and Perkins have at last succeed
ed in buying out all the other interests.
The price paid is not given out, but the
total initial investment undoubtedly ex
ceeds U. 000,000. _.â , ,
Last week the Mariposa Mining and
Commercial Company was reorganized
with the following directors: Thomas
Mem president and manager; 11. H. lay
lor vice-president; J. H. Mooser, secre
tary â¢ 11. C. Perkins and Mr. Gorham.
Thomas Mem, who will direct operations
here, states that the property will be vig
orously exploited and on a large seal.-.
The first thing to be done will be to find
out what has been bought. It seems that
none too much is known just now about
mines that were opened In the . past,
for many years ago the surveys, reports,
etc., concerning them were burned, and
the knowledge of the condition of the
mines at the last working is largely le
gend. ~gÂ£ _
Before any definite plans are laid much
time and money will be spent in clean
ing out old workings or sinking new
shafts on several of the properties. They
will be prospected at much greater depth
than has yet been reached. This means
large expenditures, the employment of a
good many men and a general awaken
ing of the old* "grant." These opera
tions will begin this summer. Meantime
the possibilities of power development,
already pretty well worked out, will be
canvassed. There is every promise that
the future will see flourishing mines and
extensive operations, and the remoteness
of the property from transportation fa
cilities brings a probable future railroad
into view. The development of the grant
will react on the rest of that great min
eral region and greatly stimulate its de
velopment. The new company has at Its
back unlimited capital for judicious in
vestment, and is composed of men who
do not do things half way.
The operations of the Melones Mining
Company, near Robinsons Kerry, Cala
veras County, is one of the big new min
ing ventures being watched with much
interest, not only on account of their
scale, but on account of the methods and
experiments attending them. A new tun
nel 5000 feet long and a new 120-stamp
mill are among the features of the devel
opment and plant in which the company
is investing $325,000 before production, in
addition to a similar amount paid for the
properties, which comprise 51130 feet on
the middle vein and 1300 feet on the east
vein of the lode, and include the Melones,
Reserve, Enterprise, Mineral Mountain.
Last Chance. Stanislaus and Keystone
mines, besides several placer claims and
mill sins. It is one of the greatest low
grade propositions in the United States,
and derives added importance from that
fact.
An interesting experiment is now going
on to determine the practicability Of dis
pensing with concentration and treating
the pulp as it comes from the plates by
the cyanide process. Following prelim
inary tests a ten-ton experimental
cyanide plant has been Installed to work
the ore by this method. So far the re
sults have been satisfactory, but no de
cision on the method has been reached.
This practice has obtained In South
Africa, but has never before been tried
in California.
W. C. Ralston, who has scored a bril
liant success by taking hold of. abandoned
old properties which have been frequent
ly, reported on adversely and securing
abundant Eastern capital to put them on
an assuredly profitable -king basis, is
the manager of the operations. He -gives
the following account of their present
status:
"The grading for the site of the 120
--stamp mill will be finished in ten days.
The milling machinery is ordered. The
stamps will weigh 900 pounds and drop
seven inches 103 times a minute. There
will be six No. 5 Gates rock crushers. The
air-compressing plant will -be capable of
operating twenty machine drills. There
will be an electric haulage plant to carry
the 01-e 5000 feet through the tunnel and
then 1000 feet to the mill. The new tunnel
is now in 700 feet and, making 8 feet per
day through hard rock. â .;__-
"Water-power will be gained through a
12,500-foot flume, seven feet wide and four
feet high, Inside measurement, which will
carry 6000 inches of water, delivering it
at a 54-foot head and furnishing -120 horse
power. Three thousand feet of the flume
is completed. The water is taken from a
Cyclopean concrete dam in the Stanislaus,
30 feet high and 300 feet long on the top,
curved up stream and 25 feet wide at the
base. The construction of the mill is not
being rushed, as it cannot be used until
the tunnel is driven. Development work
preparing the mine for the sloping is be
ing carried on through shafts. Mining
and milling will begin about next April.
We now- employ 220 men and will employ
250 when mining begins. We expect to
mill GOO tons of ore a day.
"The ore body as now developed shows
ore reserves of nearly 700,000 tons. It is
low-grade, averaging from $3 50 to $4.
The new tunnel will add 230,000 tons to the
reserves."
It has been estimated that with the
large and perfect plant being installed
mining and milling can be clone for $1 73
or less per ton. There is much ore run
ning $2 a ton or less and much running a
good deal higher, and the ore reserves
in sight averaging $3 50 to 54, spoken of by
j Mr. Ralston, and containing about $3,000.
--000 worth of gold, are but a fraction of the
great ore deposits in this property. In
1597 an ore body 27 feet wide and probably
1200 feet long was developed. Much
wider ore bodies exist as well as richer
ones. The Melones yielded nearly $1,000,000
in the '60' s from an open cut along the
wide ledge. The capital stock of the com
jam' is $2,000,000 in $10 shares. It is quoted
in the Boston Stock Exchange at $5, but j
none is on the market.
California building stones are to have a j
splendid and special opportunity at tne
Paris Exposition. The United States ex
hibit is to be fronted by a big facade or ;
worthy architectural design, to be made
up of United States building stones, Ihe
variety of color as well as material ana
design will make it a notable feature ot
the mining department of the exposition.
When Victor C. Hickes was here,
Charles G. Yale, in charge of the Cali
fornia mining exhibit, proposed among
other things a plan in this connection
which should give California building
stones special prominence. One sugges
tion was to use for windows some of Cali
fornia's translucent onyx. Inquires dv .
mall have resulted in the following
to Secretary Gaskill from the office of
Commissioner Peck, granting exceptional

Secretary J. J. Crawford of the Gwin
Mine Development Company .â re turnta
from the mine on Saturday; still feting
good over the big find of a rich new v Â«*Â°
at 1570 feet. The new vertical shaft has
reached 1000 feet, and will not leave the
vein for some time. He reports that last
week all the rock taken out in sink ng
was run through the mill without sorting
the vein matter from that of the walls.
It milled $5 a ton. As the shaft is B, feet .
wide and the vein 2 feet, but a quarter ,
of the rock milled was ore, making the ;
ore on a milling test average $-0 a .ton.
The ore was not picked out because the
arrangement of the plant made the opera
tion more expensive than mil ing even
thing. A crosscut will he run to the west
to the new vein at the 1200 level and |
when the inclined vein is cut below _lboo
â¢feet crosscuts at each level to the main
vein to the east will Intersect the new
vein.
Southern California is as wide awake in
the mining line as any other part or
the State, and progress is rapid. The Los
Angeles Mining Review sums up the Pres
ent situation in its last number, saying in
'â¢"-It is computed that there are over
4000 mines and prospects in Southern Cali
fornia. Two years ago it was computed
that there were 145 stamp mills in south- I
era California. Adding those which have
been erected since, not including cyanide
plants, brings the number up to lb4. lhese
mills have 1140 stamps, the majority of ,
which are kept busy. There are eleven
cyanide plants in operation, and the num
ber is being rapidly increased. -There are ,
also several Huntington mills, besides
arastras, concentrating plants, etc. There
are thirty-eight regularly organized mm- :
ing districts in Southern California, /here \
are also seven others, commonly spoken of
as mining districts, but which have not .
been organized as such, .in 1897 the value ;
of the mineral production of Southern
California was estimated at $o,t_Bo.W's. in i
1898 the value of its mineral production
was computed at $7,600,000. '

The three Chinese torpedo boats polic
â¢ ing the West River to protect merchant

i who took out the cargo and robbed the

j boats passed the steamer while the latter
: was being plundered and paid no atten
tion to the flag of distress. The European
| captains report that these torpedo boats
j do nothing but tow junks up and down
| from port to port, and as they get the
1 coal from the Government for nothing
they make a good personal income. In
i the evenings they anchor in the creeks
I and become for the time being flower
I boats, being crowded with singing girls.
The highest efficiency in armor is
i claimed for that made by the Krupps. it
' being equal to 2.33 times that of wrought
I iron. Thus a battleship with Krupp armor
twelve inches thick has a protection equal
â¢ to twenty-eight inches of wrought iron.
â  Since the introduction of armored ships
thirty-nine years ago, when' the Warrior
and Gloire were built, the rivalry between
gunmakersand armor manufacturers has
been carried on with varying success to
either party, but it would now seem as if
the armor has at last reached a point
which only a few of the very best guns
can attain. The penetration of the Brit
ish twelve-inch wire-wound gun is not
quite thirty inches of wrought iron at 2000
yards, and this gun is the most powerful
afloat at the present time. The Warrior's
armor of iron was only four and a half
inches thick, and could be easily pene
trated by the six-pounder Hotchkiss gun
of the present time. The same weightâ 97s
tons _ 0 Krupp armor would keep out the
projectile of the American five-inch rifle
at 2000 yards, or could be reduced to 41S
tons and maintain its former efficiency.
The heaviest armored ship in the British
navy is the Inflexible, with twenty-four
inch plates, maximum thickness, the value
of which is only thirty inches of wrought
iron, and equal protection would be af
forded by the new armor of only one-half
the thickness of the old. The result of
these progressive improvements in pro
tective material has been a vast reduction
in weights, which has been applied to giv
ing armor to other parts hitherto unpro
tected. The battleships about to be built
for our navy will carry armor of twelve
inches maximum thickness, against
eighteen inches of the Oregon and her
class, but the protection will be only
slightly reduced by the reduction in thick
ness. ___________________________

CORNERSTONE LAID IN
PRESENCE OF THOUSANDS
His Grace Archbishop Riordan Officiated at a
Solemn Ceremony in the Building of the
New Church at Tomales.
THERE may be other places in the
Golden State whose size and geo
graphical situation entitle them to
be considered of more Importance
than the little village of Tomales,
snugly 'nestled In a beautiful valley of
Marin County, near a long, slender arm
of the Pacific, but it would have been a
difficult matter yesterday to make any
of its residents believe it.
The cornerstone of the new Catholic |
-**â  hurch which will, when completed, un
doubtedly be one of the handsomest sa
cred edifices in the.' interior of the Stat.-.
was laid at Tomalos yesterday by Arch
bishop Riordan. assisted by a number of
priests from several cities, the ceremony j
b.-ing witnessed by fully 2500 people. A
large portion of those present were from j
this city, but the majority were from San
Rafael; Petaluma, Sausalito, Tomales and
th.c various villages along the line of the
North Pacilic Coast Railway. In the
audience were men who bad shown th. I
devotion to their religious belief by tak- I
ing ims and hauling the stone used In '
the construction of the church from vari- |
ous quarries in the vicinity, one of which
ls twenty miles awayâ few even con
tributing time and labor which 'would oth- I
erwise have been utilized in earning a live
llhood. It was a large crowd, but these |
earnest parishioners could be 'Id wher
ever seen â their countenances wore that
look of pride unfailingly indicative of the
satisfaction resulting from viewing ihe j
material evidence of work donated in a , ;
good cause.
Archbishop Riordan went to Tomales
yesterday afternoon as the guest of Rev. ,
Father John Rogers, the parish pastor. ;
IMPRESSIVE SCENES WITNESSED YESTERDAY AT TOMALES.
and to-day was Joined by Fathers i
James Cleary of Petaluma, P. J. Cum
mins of St. Patrick's parish and J. B.
Hannigan of St. Mary's. Together with '
Father Rogers and his assistant. Father
M. Mackay, these priests assisted In the
laying of the cornerstone. The choir of
St. Mary's Cathedral was also present
and rendered music for the occasion un
der the- direction of Father Hannigan.
Precisely at tho noon hour his Grace the ;
Archbishop took a position In front of the
stone The ceremony was begun by the
hymn "i... Latlficat, ' .â :':â  which " the |
cornerstone was blessed by Archbishop
Riordan and put In its place. Within it j
was a tin receptacle containing a docu- ;
ment giving an account of the occasion
and the names of the Pope, the President
of the United States, the Governor of
California, the Archbishop performing
the ceremony and the priests present,
copies of the daily papers of yesterday
and coins of the present year. - .
The audience was then invited by the
Archbishop to change its location to the
floor surmounting the foundation of the
church. A platform had been erected at
the western end, and from this Father
Cummins delivered the sermon. It was
both brief and eloquent, and while the
priest was speaking such perfect silence .
was observed that his voice was dis- |
tinctly audible at the outskirts of the j
crowd.
"Mv first words must be of sincere con- j
gratulation to the priests and people, j
Catholics and non-Catholics, of this town
and district." said Father Cummins. "The
building of a church, however humble, is
always a great event. No house can be
built holier than that which is conse
crated by the presence of God and the
prayers of his people. Next In sacred
ness is the home, and so our altars and
our homes have always been represented
as the highest objects of our affection and
loyalty. Poets have sung of them to
gether and brave men have died in their
defense, but holier always than the home
must the altar be because of the divine
presence which consecrates it and the
sacred mysteries of which it is a sign,
and thus "the building of a church is al
ways a great work.
"It assumes special Importance when as
here, a building Is raised worthy of its
sacred and lofty purpose; a building in
which rich and lasting materials are used,
and in the construction or' which man s
best Skill and labor are required. To ev
er.- man who thinks, the church is an ev
idence of 'he faith in God of the men and
women Â« ho built it or worship In it. It
may be humble and unostentatious, but It
presents the abiding hopes and generous
sacrifices of believing people."
Continuing, the preacher asserted that
the day has passed when any kind of cdi
flce is deemed sufficient for the purposes
of worship; that enlightened thought
points to the fact that nothing is too good
for th. house of the Most High. He gave
many Biblical illustrations of the work
and materials lavished on the ancient tab
ernacles, and pointed out that in the pres
ent Instance the people of Tomales were
not found wanting. Advice on the subject
of keeping up the interest in the- church
after it had been finished followed, and in
conclusion Father Cummins spoke as fol
lows: : , 'â _
"And may we hope that the Influence of
this church may ever extend In widening
circles; that it may reach more hearts and
stir them more deeply until the blessed
time when through God's grace all the .
followers of Christ, gathered under the ;
standard of the cross, may worship Him
In one temple and around one altar."
At the conclusion of the sermon an
offering was received while the choir sang ,
an offertory hymn. Archbishop Riordan
closed the ceremonies with an invocation. j
The choir was met. at the train anil es
corted to the site of the church by a re- j
ception committee consisting of Charles
Martin Br., Patrick Carroll, .T. Kirk and
John S. Phillips. The members were en
tertained at the conclusion of the cere
monies by a committee consisting of E.
Callen, A. Martin and Charles Martin Jr.
A banquet Was tendered the visitors pres- j
ent in the afternoon at the Town Hall.
The hospitality shown and the edibles j
furnished were of such a nature as to |
draw forth remarks of appreciation by

; Â»
The second day's celebration of the fif
tieth anniversary of the First Congrega
tional Church was most successfully car
ried out yesterday. Saturday's meeting
and banquet formed a fitting prelude to
a day that will long be remembered In the
annals of the church.
The grand edifice presented a beautiful
sight, decked in waving green ferns and
golden flowers. Behind the pulpit, with
the emblematic figures "1849" and "1809"
or. either side, was a large picture of the
Rev. T. Dwight Hunt, the first pastor of
the church In the olden days, when it
stood iii the Chinese quarter.
The musical programme was inspiring:.
From the organ loft the pure-voiced
choir, consisting of Miss Lulu C. Snyder,
soprano; Mrs. A. E. Story, contralto; J.
F. Fleming, basso, and Samuel D. Mayer,
tenor and organist, poured forth sweet
strains. The chanting of "Te Deum
Laudamus" was especially Vine.
At the morning service Dr. George C.
Adams delivered the anniversary ser
mon. Ills summary of the church's his
tory and bis interesting presentation of
statistics concerning the congregation in
the past fifty years was Listened to at
tentively by the large congregation. At
the close of his discourse Dr. Adams
called upon D. N. Hawley, the only liv
ing charter member of the church, for
some jemarks. Mr. Hawley responded in
a few apt sentences. He said:
" "We have listened to an admirable his
tory of the church by our pastor, and I
will not repeat that. The only thought
on mv mind is this: We must not forget
that this church start.-! the first mission
ary work on this coast. With Thomas
Douglas and F. S. I law ley 1 helped to
found the first missionary Sabbath-school,
in Happy Valley, and out of that begin-
nlng. has come the Howard-street
j Church." â¢- '-..â¢-'â 
At the Sabbath-school meeting, after
'the regular exercises. Mr. Hawley spoke
at greater length, giving a very enter
; taining address on his personal experi
i ences and on Sunday-school work and Its
j influence for good." He was followed by
1). W. Folger, who was the superintend
| ent twenty years ago. Judge Sawyer,
another old member, also made a few re
marks to the young people.
In the evening there were many inter
esting discourses by men who have fig
ured prominently in the life of the church.
They recalled Incidents of the past, which
j occasions like that of yesterday bring to
I life again. They spoke of the workers
of other years, whose busy hands are
I now folded forever.
Rev. 8. H. Willey dwelt on the "events
which led to the organization of this
church." E. P. Flint. Hon. E. D. Saw

PROMINENT MEMBERS
OF THE FIRST CHURCH
DN. HAWLEY ls the last surviving charter member of the First Congre
gational Church. He was one of the most active pioneers in religious
work In this city, and has been Identified with Congregationalism since
1 the beginning of the First Church, which he helped to found in 1849.
I. 11. Morse, the present senior deacon of the First Congregational Church,
is one of the most prominent members of the congregation and a leader in all
the church affairs.
Christ (Scientist) were largely attended
yesterday morning. The subject of the
sermon was "Spirit. " In the Christian
Science churches the sermons consist of'
selections from the Bible ana Science and
Health, with a Key to the Scriptures, by
Rev Mary Baker G. Eddy, read alternate
ly by two readers. The following state
ment preceded the sermon: 'The lilblo
and the Christian science text-book are
our on'y preachers. We now will read
scriptural texts and their corelatlve pass
ages from our denominational text-book. .
These comprise our sermon. The canoni
cal writings, together with the word ol
our text-book, corroborating and explain
ing the Bible texts In their spiritual im
port and application to all ages, past,
present and future, constitute a sermon
undivorc .1 from truth, uncontaminateci
and unfettered by human hypocrites and
authorized by Christ." Â ''â,*_,.
In part the sermon was as follows.
From the Bible: "God is a Spirit: and
they that worship Him must worship Him
In spirit and in truth. Bless the Lord. O
mv soul, and forget not all His benefits;
who forgiveth all thine Iniquities; who
healeth all thy diseases."
From Science and Health: Scripture In
forms us that "with God all things are
possible," all good is possible to Spirit,
but our prevalent theories practically
deny this and make healing possible only
through matter. These theories may be
false, but the Scripture IS true.

said:
This dying robber was a believer in the true
God He was, therefore, neither a Greek,
Roman nor pagan, but a Jew brought up ac
cording to the strictest moral rules and thor
oughly Indoctrinated in the true belief of the
ancient jews. But notwithstanding all his
moral training, see the pitiable depths to
which he sunk when as a dying outlaw and
vagabond he reviled Christ. It is a picture of
the awful depths to which sin can bring the
noblest and strongest. In him we have an
example of a true conversion; first, because he
viewed sin not only as destructive, but heinous
In God's Bight; second, because be put the
blame of his guilt <â¢!. himself, and third be
cause he was Interested In the welfare of his
brother robber. â¢ , ....
I declare that this dying robber faith was
pre- iter and more commendable than any other
in all the history of the world. He probably
never heard of Christ before; he had never seen
him perform a miracle; he ha.i not a single
visible token of Christ's power, and at an
hour when even Christ's disciples had forsaken
himâ yes, when Christ was bleeding and dying
the same ignominious death as himselfâ he be
lieved In Christ.
Where in all the history of the world ill
you find a faith so strong as that? With all
the testimony of the ayes rushing in upon you
of Christ's power to save, oh, sinner, aren't
you ashamed that your faith is less than that
of the dying robber who believed .without any
outward testimony? Look at his prayerâbrief,
only one sentence and humble. He asks Christ
not to consider his goodness, but to remember
him with all his iniquity, but to put alongside
that iniquity the grace of God. Will you re
member that you are not to be saved by works,
but by graceâ by the dying Savior?
FATHER DEMPSEY'S
ABLE DISCOURSE
Father Dempaey "preached to a large
congragation at St. Mary's Cathedral last
evening. His discourse was on the gospel
of the day. In part he said:
In the gospel of this day Christ places before
us two types .if mankind of his day in order
to teach man of all times what he sould avoid
and the methods to be pursued ln doing the
will of God.
A pharisee and publican go to the same tem
ple en the same occasion and perform the same
act namely, that of prayer. One utters a suc
cessful prayer, the other's act is a failure. One
meets with justification in the eyes of God
and the other greater condemnation. The rea
son of this contrast in the effects of their acts
of rave-: is seen in not what they did, but in
the manner In which they performed their ac
tion. The pharisee goes to the temple more
to praise himself than to praise God. He sees
only the good things in his own life and loses
sight of the crimes cf which be may be guilty.
More than that, he rejoices in the evil doings
of others, Inasmuch as these evil deeds by way
of contrast degrade others and thus exalt him
self. His whole net lacks honesty and sin
cerity and _:s a consequence meets with the
condemnation it deserves. The prayer of the
publican was the prayer <if a sinful man, which
came from the heart, and so was full of merit
in the eyes of God. _
REV. P. G. BUTLER
DISCUSSES "PRAYER"
At the 10:30 o'clock mass in St. Ignatius
yesterday morning, the Rev. P. G. Butler,
S. J., delivered an interesting sermon on
"Prayer." He said in part:
It is an article of faith that without grace
we can merit nothing from heaven. It in also
certain that In the ordinary course of divine
providence grace comes by prayer; hence the
necessity of prayer. True, there are other
means Of grace, such as the sacraments, but
none are so universal and easy of access as
prayer. We cannot all be priests of Christ,
nor i.-. every one called to the charge of a
family, but we can all pray.
St. Thomas says to enter heaven continual
prayer is necessary alter baptism, for al
though all sins are remitted by that sacrament
there still remain concurrence to assail us
within anil the -rid an.l the devil to attack us
from without, and where, we may ask, are
we to get the grace to 'overcome these power
ful enemies only In prayer? Ask and you shall
receive, hence without prayer salvation is Im
possible, if the church Insists upon profound
prayer as essential for thÂ§ salvation of the
Individual she no less earnestly recommends
public prayers In the family. For centuries in
the early church those who lived together
prayed tocether. But now In how many of
our families do parents and children meet night
and morning to call down the blessings of
heaven upon them? If we love the salvation
of our own, lf we would escape the curse of
ungrateful and godless, if we would have
God's blessing In peace and concord upon us.
let us gather together our family morning and
evening in his name. â 
STRONGLY CONDEMNS
INGERSOLL'S IDEA
Rev. Charles Edward Locke delivered a
striking sermon to a large gathering in
Central M. E. Church last night on
""Warnings From the Career of Colonel
Ineersoll."
Ingersoll is dead! Born and trainee! in a
Christian home, he was a formidable opponent
of Christianity, because as a product of Chris
tlantty he was not so easily victimised by the
logical results of his own fallacious arguments.
One generation of Infidelity is usually sufficient
to destroy the infidel and his family. lie
reached his maturity in a controversial period,
and, becoming out of patience with some doc
trines of the church, at lirst boldly dissented,
and before many years became the most con
spicuous exponent of infidelity in the country.
His brilliant oratory, power of invective, fond
ness for popular applause and the large finan
cial cains, doubtless led him by degrees into
the strong current of unbelief, and altogether
farther than he anticipated or desired.
I earnestly warn you, my friends, against
the Infidelity of Colonel Ingersoll, because it
recognizes no personal God and has no stand
ard of morals. It leads to anarchy; it also
leads to suicide.. It assaults the home and the 1
marriage vow by encouraging dastardly free
l.eve principles and wholesale divorce laws. It
Is the accomplice of intemperance and the
slimy procuress of immorality.

Mrs. Pinkham \ Soon of my the

Every month I grew worse and at last
became so bad that I found I was
gradually losing my mind.
** The doctors treated me for female
troubles, but I got no better. One
doctor told me that I would be insane.
I was advised by a friend to give Lydia
E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound a
trial, and before I had taken all of the
first bottle my neighbors noticed the
change in me.
"I have now taken five bottles and
cannot find words sufficient to praise it.
I advise every woman who is suffering
from any female weakness to give it a
fair trial. I thank you for your good
medicine." â Mrs. Gertrude M. John-

Recording Angel, a brindle and white

day. She won all her races in the most
impressive style, leading the doc., drawn
with her from live tb fifteen lengths. The
wonder of it all is thai she was whelped
on November 19 of last year, which makes
her eight and one-half months old," a mere
baby. John Grace, the lust-known cours

race with Wait a Little the best perform

by many lengths, showing extreme speed
with staying qualities. She let her oppo

the hare to the escape, killing before the

They were slipped to a streing ire. which

running nearly three minutes an extra

CORINTHIANS ENTERTAIN.
California Yacht Club Members Pay a i
Return Visit to Those of
Tiburon.
The California yachtsmen were the
â¢guests of the Corinthians for the past two
days, and thoroughly enjoyed the hospi
tality of their hosts. The visit was a re
turn one. the Corinthian sailors having
been received by the California s at their
new club house on Oakland Creek some
weeks since. Commodore A. M. Clay of
the Californias had been cruising around
the hay in his yacht Pactolus for about
a week, but returned In time to take his
fleet over to huron. The. first of the j
California boats to gel under way on Sat- '
urday was W. A. Duncombe's yawl Idler.
which started at 12:30 p. m. Two hours
later Vice-Commodore A. C. Lee's Sur
prise began to beat nut of the estuary.
Purine the next hour she was followed
by T. Turnbull's sloop Hope. George Mil
ler's sloop Occident. L. Gale's sloop Se
cret. E. N. Walter's sloop Km!. la and
Commodore A. M. Clay's sloop Pactolus.
A moderate breeze took the boats out
of the creek, and then freshened con
siderably In the open bay. All but the
sloops Hope and Occident took the wind
ward side .if Angel Island, these two go
ing to leeward. The wind had fallen
light when J. J. Hanifin Jr.'s launch Doris
came along and cast a friendly line to
the two yachts, towing them Into Tib
uron Cove, where all the boats dropped
anchor bet we 7 and y in the evening.
Going ashore at once, the yachtsmen
were welcomed by the Corinthians; and
sat down to a bountiful supper of fish i
chowder and other appropriate edibles '
The yachtsmen then adjourned to the I
large room of the club house, where
after Commodore Carl Westerf'eld had' j
spoken a few Introductory words, to
which Commodore A. M. Clay briefly re
plied, an entertainment of the good old
Corinthian sort was given. J. O'Brien
acted as master of monies. Frank '
Thompson and "Bob" Mitchell sang an.] ;
told stories, and the Etna Quartet ren
dered glees. A banjo trio, -. guitar and i
banjo duet, a banjo solo and other items
made up the evening's amusement. It
was after midnight before the yachtsmen
sought repose on their craft.
Yesterday morning '.colors" were made
at 8 o'clock, and about 10:30 the two
fleets, under signal from Commodore
AVesterfeld, cruised in company toward
the Heads. If. R. Simpkins' yawl Tra
montana and Commodore T. L. Hill's
sloop Cygnus also cruised out to Fori
Point. There was a strong breeze in the |
channel and a somewhat lumpy sea.

San Francisco 8. Santa Cruz 3.

Streams of humanity on baseball pleas
ure bent poured into Recreation Park yes
terday afternoon to see the Wasps sting
the Lobsters unto death. On Saturday
the local men ate Lobster a la Neuberg;
yesterday morning they whetted their
appetites with a lobs pbulette and In
the afternoon put an end to the whole
cies by sponging it off the menu,
Not for many ears has San Francisco
seen such a kwge concourse of people at
a baseball game, and it was an enthu
siastic crowd at that, something very
much like the old days when then wasn't
an unoccupied bench within the fences.
Hank Harris wore a smile that sounded
on Missjon street and Truthful Looie
looked pleased when the garni began,
Even after the- game was in progress
spectators came and came, lilling the
seats on the far-off sides of the field. Th.
Wasps had the mob with them, and they
were cheered again and gain, although
good playing] by the visitors was never
unattended by an. appreciative acknowl
edgment. To intensify the small-sized
bedlam, Tip O'Neil Indulged in a Fourth
of July play with firecrackers, the papers
of which would blow in the faces of the
Lobsters and the smoke straight in their
eyes. In their .lying groans ihe shellfish
made this secret confession.
The game was an interesting one to I*.
-spectator, for there was a-plenty of hit
ting and exciting moments which ended
in a catastrophe. Eleven hits by the local
bat-swingers assisted by some fulsome
errors on the part of the visitors gave
the game to San Francisco. In the fourth
inning the Lobsters were being mixed In
a stew. They went to pieces and broke
completely. Wild throwing, poor judg
ment and careless work came near to
their ultimate ruin at this early stage of
the game. The Wasps played good ball,
bin two errors showing against their
record.
In the first inning Streib was sent across
the plate for ihe Lobsters; the second in
ning was a blank for both teams. Then
the Wasps got out their feelers and began
working. Pyne whacked the leather out to
left and scurried to second when O'Neil
craftily tipped the ball thai Clark dropped
at first, "Tip" holding the bag. Fitzpatrick
at the plate made a kidney mark for
Balsz's curves and he crawled to first ln
fierce but happy pain. A long fly to left
by Hllderbrandt, who went out, gave Pyne
a. chance to score and he took it. Muller
was next up. and he hit on the ground to
Drennan, who returned, but the ball
hounded past Pace and O'Neil scored.
That was the sum total of runs this in
ning.
With lamps aflame with- heat and terri
ble determination, the Lobsters came up
for the third inning. Devereaux and Wil
liams coursed the bags and placed their
team once more In the lead. But San
Francisco had a special inning of its own
in the fourth, when they batted the sphe
roid around the field and played havoc
with all the Lobsters in the bay. Pace
threw bad ball tee bases, the Infield forgot
diamond truths and the team became dis
organized. Muller and O'Neil scored In
this inning after then were two out. The
runs for the- local team came in bunches
of two. In the fifth inning another pair
was added to the list, and In the ninth
a few pieces of fireworks were handed to
the Lobsters and two runs marked down
on the San Francisco tally list.
The morning game at Oakland was an
other victory for the all-devouring Wasps.
Except for* the- fifth Inning, when the
fielding of the local men was clothed In
moth-eaten fringe, thr. game was interest
ing and exciting. In that inning Iberg
went up against some heavy hitters, and
his support was of the forgetting kind.
In the first inning the local men scored
once and repeated the dose in the second.
Two to nothing was the score until the
fourth, when the- Lobsters began to pick
themselves up and fly around the bases.
O'Neil made a brace of errors, and Iberg
was found tee his undoing. Five times
they rapped his untwisted curves over
foreign territory, tearing the cover oft the
ball. After much leather chasing the in
ning came to a close. The score now
read 4-2 in favor of the beach promen
aders. -â¢
The- sixth inning brought another run
to Frisco, and the- seventh won the game
for the local twlrlers. Muller hit to left,
followed by a hit by Krug. Then Sullivan
went out, but Riley whacked the- spheroid
for a single and Muller scored. After a
bit of. play with the stick by Swindells
Krug see. red. making the last run of the
day and the winning one for his team.
These three victories of the Wabsters
over the Lobsters place the local tossers
well in tin- lead. The scores in the two
games yesterday follow:

WASONVILLE, July 30.â Cal Bwing's
Dudes are still on the toboggan. They
received a terrible drubbing at the hands
of Morris' Sugar Beets yesterday, and the
dose was repeated to-day. The latter
club's batters have evidently found their
batting eyes, judging by the way they
hammered Steffanl yesterday a::-! Moskl
man to-day. The Infleldlng was
perfect. Many long drives were pulled
down by them that at first looked like
safe hits. Kiel Whelan cleverly outpointed
Mosklman in the twirling act. The rank
errors of Schmeer and Peoples were re
sponsible for runs. O'Connell's umpiring
on both days was highly satisfactory to
both clubs. The score was as follows:

Borchers Makes a Long Drive.
SACRAMENTO. July SO.â Sacramento
and San Jose split even to-day. In the
morning game the locals were shut out.
The great box work of Andrews, together
with a half-dozen errors on the part of
the locals, fixed the responsibility. Some
of Umpire Long's decisions were much
criticized.
In the afternoon game the visitors again
put Andrews into the box, and while he
pitched a great game he tired and the
locals won. The feature of the game was
a phenomenal hit by Borchers. He lifted
the ball high over the fence for a home
run. The cover was rent, ripped and torn,
and the ball proper was elongated until
it resembled a cucumber. So far .is is
known only two such hits are on record,

had the better .if the start, but Bald went
right up to him in a second, and for three
laps out of the four constituting tin- mile
there was not - is than the width of a
tape line between Eddie's leading wheel
and "Zimmy's" rear one.
This was kept up until after the fourth
lan had been finished, when Bald shot
ahead. Zimmerman was either tumble
or unwilling to make a spurt. Bald at
once put spans of da*- i-rht between them,
and finished four --arris ahead in 2:13.
The results in the other races were:

Zimmerman and Bald have been idolized
by the wheelmen of America for years
Th.- former was champion In 1890,11891. }Â» -
and IS.-:- . Bald was Invincible in 189*>, 1896
and 1897. Both have been an honor to the
sport especially Zimmerman, who was the
most popular champion America has ever
developed. His first notable race was at
Peoria, 11!.. in I*- "'. when he defeated W.
\v in. lie. then amateur champion. zim
rode a Star bicycle, a lever propelled ma
chine, with a fifty-inch rear wheel and a
tiny steering one In front. On this odd bi
cycle Zimmerman won from the pick of
American riders. _, '
The following year he took to the safe

use Contrary to the- expectations ot ins
friends, he proved a better rider on the
small machine than he had been on his
cumbersome Star. lie won as he pleased
in an company in which he started. In
1592 he made a racing pilgrimage to Eng
land allowing himself but a trie period
in which to became acclimated. He won
the cue. five and fifty miles champion

would have placed the fourth of the se
ries the twenty-flve-miles. to his credit
but for an unfortunate accident. It was
run in the rain, and another competitor
falling brought down Zimmerman. _
In the following year the champion
spent several months in France, where
cycling was on the flood tide of prosperi

winning all his races with consummate
ease in his last year of success lie won
102 races in the severest competitions
I meeting a host of new riders under all
banner of conditions. His next venture
was a racing pilgrimage to Australia.
which was not a success. He was ill
throughout his entire stay In the col
onies and gave only one exhibition of
his wonderful ability. He was defeated
by J AY Parsons and others, but in his 1
last start he ran clean around -i large
field of men and electrified the great con
course of spectators by running away
from his competitors. That one race
saved the fame of Zimmerman in the an
tipodes. He has not raced in some years
until recently. He has regained his old
time speed but the- dash and the masterly
headwork are gone, and Zimmy, the best
known bicycle rider the wide world over,
must remain an ex-champion.
Edward C Bald has visit. -el this coast
three times his last trip being as one of
Tod Sloan's party some months since,
when he rode exhibitions at the Mechan

til 1895 when he took the place of an in
jured rider on one fwf the racing teams at
that time supported by the bicycle manu
facturers. Bald was an "amateur," but
received a liberal salary and all his ex
penses In addition he won about $10,000
worth of diamonds, which could read
ily be turned Into cash!. He was the tin
disputed champion of America in 1895,
1896 and 1897. Last year he was shew to

UNIVERSITY )AT CREW
WILL GO TO ASTORIA
Berkeley Men on the Water Daily-
Preparing for the Pacific Coast
Regatta in t*_.e Northwest.
BERKELEY^ July 30.â 1t Is settled that
the University of California crew will go
to Astoria in August to take part in the
Pacific Coast regatta set for the ..nth.
Ever since the Berkeley men met with
success, at El Campo the . rowing spirit
in the boating '.association has risen- to. a
high pitch of enthusiasm, and the oars
men feel equal, to much greater efforts
than any they have made before. They
will go to Astoria with a fair share of
confidence in their chances of upholding
the blue and gold.
The men comprising the crew are: Roy
Fryer, James Mupper, I*, W. tyaggec
hauser, Clifton li. Tracy and Eddie Ham
mer (cockswain): The crew is training
every evening in the four-oared gig be
longing to the University â¢of California
Boating Association at Sessions basin.
Unfortunately the college has no barge
to enter In the race, and recourse must
be had to borrowing from some of the
boat clubs In the vicinity. It is expect
ed that the fast barge belonging to the
Stockton club may be secured for the
occasion. '

SMALL BOYS AND A BARGE.
Youngsters Cut a Freighter Loose
From Its Moorings.
Two small boys designing to become
seamen, with but little nautical knowledge
in their craniums cut adrift one of Henry-
Peterson's freight barges at the Folsom
street wharf yesterday afternoon. One
of the boys constituted himself . captain
and the other mate. Navigation was
scarcely perceptible with the hulk .hoc ed
to the wharf, so the captain and mate
simultaneously cast off the lines and
started for the open sea. The fide car
ried the youngsters out some distance
fore they were noticed, and a passing
tug had a narrow escape from colliding
with the -rudderless ship. Finally a
launch was secured and brought the cast
aways back to port.
The little chaps were so badly fright
ened when they landed tnat they were
unable to. tell their names. The inci
dent caused plenty of excitement on tne
water front, particularly when the big
tug was seen bearing down on the barge.
HORSES RUN AMUCK.
Lively Animals Dash. Up Market
Street, With Danger. to Life.
A band of horses which were awaiting
shipment at the water front yesterday
afternoon broke away from their keepers
and caused much commotion on Market
street shortly afterward as they dashed
up the main thoroughfare, endangering
life and property. There were about
twenty animals in the band, and after
their escape they were pursued by two
vaqueros. At the time there were com
paratively few people on Market street,
but those who chanced to be on crossings
took warning at the clatter and retreat
ed to safety. In some Instances women
sought the interior of saloons, and there
was a general stampede for convenient
doorways. The horses uashed along
at a breakneck speed and shied continu
ally. In front of the Phelan building two
of the animals stumbled and the remain,
der of the bunch narrowly escaped demol
ishing a cable car which was passing.
The horses were captured near the Pre
sidio.

SCULLERS IN COMPETITION.
! Dolphins Entertain Many Friends
With Boat itaces and Various
Amusing Contests.
The cozy quarters of the Dolphin Boat
ing Club yesterday was given over to la
dies' day. From 10 in the morning until
late in the afternon the clubhouse was
crowded with ladies and brother oarsmen.
Though it was pleasantly warm in thq
sheltered cove the water outside was
rough and choppy, an ebb tide meeting a
strong westerly breeze.
The first event on the programme was
the second race for the Dolphin diamond
medal, which was won easily by the hold
er, George Baker, his competitor. Dr. F.

swamped. The distance was about one
and a half miles and. the winner's time 13
minutes 52 seconds. The special rave be
tween H. Piess and T. M. Ferguson was
rowed In gigs, the water being too rough
for outrigged skiffs. T. M. Ferguson,
steered by F. "W. Woernner, won In 25
minutes ii' seconds. The loser was steered
by A. P. Rothkopf. There is talk of an
other contest between the two scullers.
The Italian crew not appearing, the in
ternational barge race resolved itself into
a contest between the- Irish and German
fours. The German crew, made up of
A. P. Rothkopf, bow; F. W. VVoernner,

A skiff race in which A. \A'. Tape start

Big Rumpus Caused Because King
David's Advice Was Ignored to
"Put Not Your Trust in

â¦
Oakland Offlce San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, July SO.
That little combine among the Council
men has gone to pieces, and the frag- i
ments are to be found In a dozen different j
places. That meeting of the committee of j
the whole was a revelation. No one was
prepared for the display of bitterness an _
the innuendo that was hurled by one
member at another. It explained much
that for a few weeks had been rather
obscure. It dispelled some rumors and
â¢Added strength to others, and to those
who took the leading parts the incident
of last Monday night seemed to afford
marked relief, as though the many ebul
litions had been corked up for a long
time.
The events which led up to the many
outbursts of personality have been for
gotten, but B-..me of the remarkable
speeches will influence every vote
taken In the Council till the end of its
term. The manner In which the Council
was taught not to put its trust in princes
âespecially in Prince Poniatowskiâ ls a
past Incident. It will be catalogued with
many other little affairs of the same kind,
but the debate over the report will live
as long as there are Cuvelliers or Rowe.
or Girards or Motts in the City Council.
As is usual in such incidents, there was
absolutely no need for it. The fact upon
which the present agitation for a munici
pal water plant was founded had been
exploded weeks before and all the Coun
cilmen knew it. When Mr. Cuvellier ex
hibited his extraordinary haste to have
the whole matter referred to his commit
tee he had something on which to build.
The Prince had talked facts and figures
and presumably meant business. Before
Mr. Cuvellier prepared his report it was
known thai the Prince had fallen down;
that he had hedged the whole scheme
around with so many impossible condi
tions that it was a flat failure so far as
Oakland is concerned. This was all known
and every member of the Council had read
of it in The Call. There was therefore no
need to have called a meeting of the com
mittee of the whole to discuss Mr. I'uvel
lier's report, because It was known be
forehand that any discussion would be
unproductive of result. Under these cir
cumstances the Councilmen were to be
pardoned for not becoming enthusiastic
over a proposition already dead.
There was much that was commend
able ln the position taken by Mr. Rowe.
He objected very forcibly to the Council
taking up every old water scheme and ad
vertising it for its owners, well knowing
that no good would come of it. Whether
he meant to infer that the Prince had al
ready "worked" the Council via Cuvellier,
or whether Cuvellier referred to Rowe In
his remark about Insincerity, are points
for the two gentlemen to decide between
themselves. It Is clear, however, that
Mr. Rowe wants no more rainbow chasing
in the matter of municipal water plants.
There may be water enough in the arte
sian belt that ruts through Roberts
Landing to supply ten Oaklands or not
one San .i.elrei. but no actual good can
come from the visit. of a few Councilmen
last Saturday. The most that could be
done would be the sampling of the water
and anything else that Captain Roberts
might present for sampling. This could
just as well be done by any one member
of the Council and better still by the
City Chemist, who could tell of what the
water is actually composed. Nothing but
a thorough survey by an expert could re
veal whether the supply be large or
small or whether it might not be entirely
cut off by some little meteorological freak
in the Sierras. A junketing trip by a few
Councilmen cannot prove of any value,
and it is these non-productive affairs that
draw out the ire- of the Councilmen, the
disgust, of the public, and that lay the
foundation for all th. talk about playing
to the gallery. All this buncombe has
long since ceased to deceive, and the
sooner this fact is appreciated the sooner
will the history of the rise and fall of
mushroom office-seekers be materially
abbreviated.
Ariel the Mayorâ who can blame him for
the self-satisfied smile that crept over his
face while those Councilmen were per
spiring blood arguing over goats' wool?
That little dinner party where a type- I
written list of appointments was present
ed to him must have appeared to him
Inst Monday night as a nightmare.
Where was the harmony that nine out of
the eleven Councilmen had shown regard
ing those appointments? During the heat
of the arguments had, the Mayor intro
duced a resolution declaring thai Mr. Mil
ler was the worst Superintendent of
Streets thai Oakland had ever known,
lie would probably have got eight votes
for it even if the resolution were to be
rescinded at the next meeting. Never
again need the Mayor feel that a ma-'
jority of he Council can be depended
upon' to follow a programme. The chains
are broken. The leashes have he-en
clipped and each of the eleven Councilmen
is evtdentlv at liberty to make the race
f--.r-M.ivor if he loses and to do it in the
manner most pleasing to him.
Mr. Mott is to be pitied. He has an idea
-a large one. He believes that if Oak
land were to .-, something, something
might be done. Mr. Mott has exposed
himself to the shafts of every obstruction
ist and silurian that exists, and will per
haps he adjudged by some to be a ; it sub
ject for an asylum. lie is engaged in
business] and has discovered that wharves
six- necessary adjuncts to a water front
that expects to be the scene of comm-.r
cirtl development. Mr. Motl believes that
at bond issue for the purpose of building
wharves and docks is worthy of the con
sideration of Oakland. Every man who
knows enough of this city to justify him
in f xpressing his opinion knows that this
is true. A million spent on docks and a
million In nark and permanent Improve
ments would do more for Oakland than
anything else that could possibly be de
vised.
But Mr. Motl Is to bo pitied for having
such an advanced idea. He must be an
ego that has skipped .i few re-embodi
ments and come back half a century too
soon. What can he be wanting? Un
doubtedly he, too, ls In the race for
Mayor.
Mr. Glrard also has an idea that
sounds as strange and foreign as that of
Mr. Mott. Mr. oirard believes that a city
should encourage Industries to locate in
Its midst. ii. believes that what ls worth
having is worth seeking and worth work
ing for. He has asked the City Council
to undertake an investigation along these
linos. Mr. 'ill-are! is aware of the fact

JACOB ROSENBERG CALLED
SUDDENLY BY DEATH
JACOB ROSENBERG, a prominent wool merchant doing business at 221
Front street, dropped dead yesterday while on his way with his wife to
visit some friends in Berkeley. The deceased gentleman had been trou
bled with heart failure for some time previous to his sudden end. His
death was no doubt hastened by his anxiety to secure a small hand-basket
which his wife had left behind her in the waiting-room of the Oakland
ferry, at the foot of Market street, while on their way to board the ferry boat
for the purpose of spending the afternoon with some friends in Berkeley.
It was understood by both Mr. and Mrs. Rosenberg that there was some
valuable Jewelry in the hand-basket, and its temporary loss excited him. On
reaching the place where the basket had been left he was seen to place his hand
over his heart and gasp for breath. He fell where he was standing and x
pired almost immediately. Sergeant Avon of the harbor police sent to the
Receiving Hospital for the ambulance, but finding that death had don.- its
work the Coroner was notified, and Deputy John D. Sullivan with the Morgue
wagon removed the body to the Morgue.
The deceased was born in Findlay, Ohio, 59 years and 6 months ago. He
arrived In California in 1858 and at once connected himself with the Marysville
Appeal, where he remained until IS7T, when he ram.- to San Francisco and en
tered the employ of Moody & Farish, wool dealers. On the retirement of this
firm he opened business for himself, and with his three sons, R. < '. . G. A. and
I_,. R. Rosenberg, successfully carried on the business.
Mr. Rosenberg belonged to the Ancient Order United Workmen and Knights
of Honor. He resided with his family at 2319 Sacramento street.
must be wanting something. No one will
credit him with being sincere. He, toe>,
must certainly be in the race for Mayor.
Some day. perhaps, this city will wake
up and will shake the wool off Its eyes.
It will then discover how many sincere
men it has mistrusted, how many dema
gogues it has worshiped, and how much
capital has been kept away because of
the mouthings of men who are forever
stepping on their own shadows, and whose
DOlftical ambitions dwarf any honor they
may have had and blind their consciences.
The Mayor was honest enough a few
days ago to write a letter for publication
saying that he had talked too much, an.l
had better "cork up." At the celebrated
committee meeting he sal.l In an aside:
"I think there is need of some of my
corks."
There is need for about seven.

OAKLAND IS NOW SEEKING FOR A
BETTER MUNICIPAL WATER SUPPLY
OAKLAND. July .10.â of the
serious questions now agitating
Oakland's City Council is that of
the acquisition of a municipal
water supply. The matter has long
been discussed and has now pro
gressed so far that property has been
bonded with a view that the city
might, If the voters Bee fit, become
the owner of deep-water wells from
which the supply may prove equal to
the city's demands.
For the past few days members of
the City Council have boon viewing
the property of Captain Roberts near
Han Lorenzo. As stated in to-day's
Call, a party of Councilmen yesterday
visited the Roberts property, and the
impression left on the Counctlmen was
.so favorable that the property has
been bonded. To-day another party
of city father:; visited the wells,
among them Councilmen Mott, Shaffer
and others, and from what can be
gathered from them they also found

OAKLAND. July 30. St. Joseph's Por
tuguese Church on Chestnut street was
thronged to-day with an unusually large
congregation. Rev. Father A. D. de
Campos, formerly of Napa, and who hast
gained many praises for his good work
in the missionary field at the Sandwich
Islands, has been placed in charge of the
church and parish, temporarily at least.
Father d.- Campos made a decidedly fa

unpleasant notoriety of Father Gloria-,
recent unfrocking seems now to be a thing
of the world and not of the church, where
supreme harmony dwells twixt priest and

Lady Love Writes of His Infidelity
to His Deserted Wife in lowa
and She Sends Him the
Epistles.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 30.
Frank Mott, the San Pablo avenue grip
man who yesterday made an almost suc
cessful attempt to end his life by cut
ting his left wrist with a razor, with
the purpose of hying himself hence from
this vale of tears, has, in street parlance,
"jumped out of the frying-pan Into the
fire."
When Mott was arrested last May fur
- assault with a deadly weapon upon Miss
Eliza Schomberg, the buxom blonde ser
vant girl of Fruitvale, he was release.!
i on furnishing $200 bonds. Druggist Robert
Bell and Mr. Shiffey of the Postofflce res
taurant were his sponsors. The trial has
been postponed from time to time ever
! since, as there was no Inclination on the
pari of any one to press the matter, and
moreover he had already been pretty
heavily fined for carrying a concealed
: weapon.
Shortly before midnight last night,
about the time Dr. Howe at the Receiving
Hospital expressed the sanguine words
that he was out of danger, Mott's two
bondsmen declared their intention to sur
render the grlpman to the police authori
ties. They were no longer anxious to take
any chances, fearing that Motl might
either make another attempt on his life
or in case of his recovery skip out, and
they thereby become answerable In the
sum of th. bond given. Accordingly Motl
was this morning removed to the City
Prison and unless he can secure new
bondsmen he will languish in durance vile
until his ease is tried.
When seen at the City Prison to-day
Motl figuratively clapped .1 padlock upon
his lips. He- refused to talk about his
troubles or give any reason for his rash
attempt at self-destruction other than
that it was owing to troubles.
His secret however, has been divulged
through a friend to whom Mott retailed
his woes last night, and It now develops
- that he tried to kill himse.i. because Mi -
Schomberg, with whom he was infatuated,
had not only thrown off on him because
Of the alleged assault upon her last May.
but because the young domestic had also
written letters to his wife at Dcs Moines.
, la., relating to the deserted woman the
adventures of her wayward- husband,
charging him point-blank with Infidelity
and conduct otherwise not in accordance
with the rules married men are supposed
to follow. _,_ ,_ ..
Some of these letters Mrs. Mott sent
back from Dcs Moines to her recreant
spouse to show her cognizance of his
waywardness, and at th.- same time up
braiding him for so cruelly breaking his
i matrimonial vows. j
These letters were found on Mott when
he was removed to the Receiving Hospi
tal and they are now In the- hands of the
police. Mott will probably be arraigned
for trial as soon as he has recovered suf
ficient strength. Dr. J. 11. Todd is now
attending him at the City Prison, and
reports that his patient will have suffi
ciently recovered to stand trial In a few
days. _
Lost Part of His Foot.
ALAMEDA. July 30.â Louis P. Howe.
grandson of Mrs. Mary Clawlter of Cen
tral avenue, met witn a painful accident
recently while prospecting at Little
Minook in the Klondike region. He was
wielding a pick, when it slipped, striking
squarely on his right foot, tearing the
flesh to the bone. Dr. Honecker. who
was with him, dressed the wound, the
ration requiring thirteen stitches. The
gash however, did not heal, and It was
found necessary to amputate part of the

Michael where he is rapidly recovering.
He will return to his home in Alameda

freshmen and sophomores. In an inter

his lectures would after be confined
almost exclusively to upper classmen and
graduates who are taking the more ad
vanced courses In those- subjects.
any future demand.
The matter of ultimately accom
plishing the municipal ownership of
water rests, however, wholly with the
people of Oakland. Mayor Snow did
not go on the trip to-day, though he
had intended to. However. In speak
ing of the water supply at the Roberts
wells the Mayor said:
"I believe that the Council is now on
the right track aw far as locating a
good water supply for Oakland is con-
cerned. I have always considered
these Roberts wells a good thing and
am more than glad that they are being
visited with a view of considering
seriously the problem of acquiring
them for the city."
Councilman Girard. who went out
yesterday with the Stetson party, was
exceedingly enthusiastic. "They are
fine wells,'' said he. "Yes. I stand
ready to advocate their purchase."

Six Improvement Clubs Have Already

The idea conceived and urged by May â¢>'
Snow of forming a Central Improvement.
Club as a fountain head of the various
improvement clubs of this city is rapidly
reaching that stage where its accom
plishment Is asssured.
The sub-committee appointed recently
by the- various clubs t.i arrange for the
organisation of a central club held an
enthusiastic meeting last night in the
rooms of the Oakland Board of Trade.
; Among the clubs represented at the meet
. ing were: The West Oakland, by H. W.

also signified its approval of the central
club idea and was taken into the fold

â  ganization, together with a constitution
and ley-laws. This committee will meet
1 to-morrow night and thereafter report
' and submit the result of Its work to the

Wednesday night.
, The plan must likely to prevail is that
! of restricting the membership In the pro
posed Central Improvement Club to those
i ; who are on the rolls of the clubs in the
I scheme. The central club will then ob
t viously serve the purpose of drawing to
: gether in regular sessions members of
- all the Improvement clubs in this

Two Fatalities on the British Ship
Ancaios â Woman Stabbed in a
Fremont-Street Lodging
. House.
It was the busiest Sunday the water j
front has seen in many a month yester- :
day. The transport Hancock got in with ]
the Nebraska volunteers during the night;
the steamer City of Sydney arrived from
Panama; the City of Peking and Gaelic
from the Orient; the British ship Ancaios
from Liverpool, and the French bark
Touralne from Swansea.
The Hancock and City of Sydney docked
during the morning, but the Gaelic did
not get alongside until late in the after
noon, and the Peking will not be released,
from quarantine until this morning. The
Gaelic brought 58 cabin, 8 second cabin, 13
Japanese and 209 steerage passengers,
while the Peking carried 32 cabin, 22 Euro
pean steerage and 139 Chinese' passengers.
The two steamers had Quite an excit
ing race from Honolulu, the Gaelic win
ning by ten hours. The Peking got away '
lirst, but the Gaelic soon overhauled her. 1
Then they lost sight of each other, only!
to meet again outside the Heads yester- j
day morning when the fog lifted. The ;
Peking had every stitch of canvas set and .
was bowling along at a great rate, and \
beat tin- Gaelic twenty-live minutes in j
the race front the Reads to the quaran- ;
tine grounds. The Gaelic made the run
In G days 1 hour and 53 minutes and the
City of Peking in 6 days 11 hours and 65
minutes from Honolulu.
The hospital ship Relief was in trouble
at Yokohama on July 2. While making
port from Nagasaki she went ashore on ,
the Saratoga Spit" and stayed there for
twenty-four hours. The Norwegian
steamer Thyra tiled to pull her off, but i
her hawsers parted. The next day there
was an unusually high tide and the :
steamer floated off. 'the Relief was still j
at Yokohama when the Gaelic sailed.
The British ship Ancaios arrived from j
Liverpool yesteruay after an unusually I
long passage "i I*>:_ days. She hau a sue- j
cession of southwest gales after leaving \
the British Channel anu had another siege j
of the same kind of weather off the Horn. .
There were a couple of sad fatalities uur- I
lng the voyage. One of the men fell ;
overboard from the jibboom and was |
drowned. His companion took his death
so much to heart thai he went insane, j
jumped overboard and was also drowned. j
On January 31, In latitude 47 north, longi- j
tude 11 west, Arthur Smith, aged 22 years, j
was lost overboard. He was out on the
jibboom in company with Leon Petitgren,
and losing his balance fell Into the ocean. j
Petitgren' seemed paralyzed by the acci
dent, but managed to get inboard again.
From that time on he was crazy, and on
February 2, in latitude IT north, ix west,
he yelled. "I'm coming:" and Jumped j
overboard. The ship was hove to and a. '
j boat lowered, but not a trace of thf crazy
man could he found. Petitgren was a
native of New York, aged 10 years.
The Ancaios was one of the fleet of ves
sels that lay in Manila Bay during the
destruction of the Spanish men-of-war.
Captain Fulton says it was a masterly
| piece of work and Admiral Dewey de
' serves all the credit he has received, and
more too.
The Mail Company's steamer ' City of
Sydney arrived from Panama and way
ports early yesterday. She brought up a
large cargo, nearly all of which came
from New Y'irk. and a good many passen
gers. The San Bias will take the Syd
ney's place, going out on August 8. The
latter vessel will probably be turned over
to the Government for use as a transport.
The French bark Touralne arrived from
Swansea after a quick passage of 129 days.
The. Touraine is on her maiden voyage
and is a very handsome vessel. She is the
first of a big fleet of French built vessels
that are now heading this way. Since
France began paying .1 mileage subsidy to
Its merchant marine, the number of ves
sels flying the tricolor has nearly doubled.
In the case of San Francisco alone there
are on the way here a dozen French
vessels, nearly all new, while last year
there were only two. 'Wl'.'-??.
There was a good sized row In the fam
ily lodging-house at 343 Fremont street
yesterday, and as a result John Donahue
is charged at the Harbor Police Station
with an assault with a deadly -weapon,
while Mrs. Mary Johnson had a slashed
. heel, and a black eye fixed up at the
Harbor Hospital. It appears that Mrs.
Johnson's rooms are over those occupied
by Donahue. The latter works all night
and has to Ret his sleep during the day.
He says Mrs. Johnson makes his life mis
erable' by the racket she and her friends
kick up "when he Is trying to sleep. Yes
terda* he met her on the stairs, and when
he spoke to her she tantalized him, and
he forgot himself and struck her. The
cut on her cheek she got on the banister.
Mrs. Johnson says Donahue Is the most
quarrelsome man alive. Saturday night
he promised to make her an inmate of the
Morgue, and yesterday he. tried to kill
her. He stabbed her in the face and then
tried to throw her down stairs. She called
for help and Officer Hemenez went to her
assistance. Donahue ran away when he
heard the policeman coming and locked
himself in 'his room. He would not come
forth when called upon, and the officer
had to break down the door to secure him.
Both the .man and woman were taken
away in the patrol wagon.
The Harbor Hospital is the most.neces
sary institution on the water front, and
there will be a howl of indignation if the
Board of Health closes the place. This
month has not been as busy as some of
the preceding ones, yet up to noon, yes
terday 326 cases had been treated, or an
average of more than ten cases a day.
The members of Court Apolo. A. O. F..
and their friends had a jolly time on the
bay yesterday. They chartered the
steamer Caroline and to the number of
2QO went for a cruise. After visiting t-ie

TURNERS FAIRLY EXCEL THEMSELVES.

in a Long
Line.
â¦ â
FRt S o'clock yesterday morning.
all through the day and long into
the night the organizations partici
pating in tin- seventeenth biennial
festival of the Pacific Turn Bezirk
were on the move. In the morning they
paraded, several thousand strong, through
the streets of the city, breaking ranks to
be whirled on the cars to Glen Park,
which had been turned over to them for
the occasion and will be again occupied
to-day by them. All during the afternoon
-they swarmed in the windswept valley in
the. Mission hills, watching the turners
turn and drill and jump, listening to the
Fongs of the singing sections, blowing the
froth of the brew of the vaterland. dan
ting on the hurricane decks of two out
door pavilions and complaining of the
dust-laden gales that came near to mar
ling the pleasures of an easily pleased
people
But just as the committee in charge
began to talk seriously of postponing the
athletic events arranged for the open and
confining the afternoon's programme to
the addresses in the theater and the sing
ing competition, the wind, as if only
waiting for this threat, died down to a
comparatively gentle blow, the sun came
.-.;u strong, things warmed up generally
and the committees decided to allow the
individual athletic competitors to pro-
The afternoon under these changed con
ditions passed pleasantly enough, and tne
dusty pleasure-seekers reinforced by a
lunch well washed down âto procure
which they made such a run on the cafe
as had never been seen beforeâ began to
enjoy themselves. They succeeded ad
mirably, and between the singing and the
turning, the dancing and the shooting,
wore ready for the dinner upon which to
place the superstructure ot the evening s
entertainment at Turner Hail.
The programme olfered could not nave
been bettered, and the capacity of the
hall was more than taxed by those who
enjoyed it. A splendidly arranged con
cert "concluded the entertainment of one
of tbe greatest days in the history of the
Pacific Turn'Bezirk.

up to board forty special oars provided
for the purpose of conveying the Turners
to Glen Park. Despite the early hour tlie I
entire line < >*" march was crowded with i
spectators; and the Turners .ami the or
ganizations marching with them were j
cheered many a time and ft. The differ
ent orsanizations showed up in line form,
the supple figures of the Turner:- showing
to advantage in 'their gray gymnasium
â¢uniforms. The organizations of sharp
shooters in .lager uniforms had a jaunty
businesslike air, while the boys' and girls'
turner classes were represented by targe
delegations;
The Hanoveraner Verein made two dis
tinct hits. It was mounted on any num
ber of gray horses, and ii was led by the
fattest man in the procession, Oscar
Hocks not barn
The Germania Club's float was < . r_ ..- of
the most artistic conceptions every Â«cen
.in a parade in this city. It was designed
to represent the friendly feeling between
the Fatherland and the opted country,
p.nd to this end showe 1 representatives
â¢nf the army and navy of each nation
grouped about tlie geni-.rs of the club, a
very charming personage: who is Miss
Anna l.achmann in private life. Henry

Carrying out the idea of harmony, Trifle
Sam. represented by Ernest Gehrmann,
completed th-'- tableau vivant. which was
-.bordered by a group of prettily dressed
children.
Another float thnt attracted consider
able attention was that symbolic of the
turners themselves. On It. in company
with the ladles representing Columbia
and Eureka, was Father Jann himself,
without whom there would not. have been
the turner organization of to-day.. Henry
Hllpiscll had the honor of representing
the founder of the organization. Mrs.
Martha Bart* 11 -was Columbia and Mrs.
Mary Schueite Eureka;
Arrived at the park, the turners and
their friends spread themselves out all
over the place. They crowded the pavil
ions and flooded the cafe until the waiters
were fairly swamped with orders; they
took possession of the theater and
lunched ere, too: they shot at targets
and visited tho sideshows and mixed up
generally as only a good-natured crowd
can. It was a day for general good
fellowship and no one let an opportunity
go by i. improve it. even in the face of
the saucy zephyr:, and the nebulous real
estate. ; -' â¢
After lunch any number of bands struck
up. a::d notwithstanding the clouds of
dust a picked lot of about 130 turners from
theÂ» San Francis* >, Mission. Eintracht and
Veorwaerts vcreins, all local, and the Ban
Jose. Sacramento, Oakland, Marysville,
Napa and Stockton organizations.
marched Into the amphitheater to give the
mass exercise. Each gray-clad turner
carried a pair of wooden bells, and for
half an hour, under the direction of Rob
ert rth, the technical leader, they went
Through the niarvelously beautiful evolu
tions of the turner drill. They worked
with a will in a breeze almost strong
enough to lift them off their feet, and they
perspired to sue ii purpose that not one of
them hut collected more than his share of
the flying hillsides In cakes beneath his
eves. " They did not mind a little thing
like that, however, and retired amid
rounds of applause to prepare for the ath
letic contests, while crowds upon crowds
piled Into the theater to listen to the ad
dresses and the competition of the sing
ing societies.
E. A. Denicke made the opening ad
dress on the invitation of the festival
committee. He began by telling the pleas
ure It gave him to address the turners
after an intermission of twelve years, and
pointed out the fact that they had as
sembled, a.Â« formerly, to give evidence of
that progressive force which marks the
spirit of the times and which had done
so much in pushing civilization. In fur
thering this civilization, he continued; the
United States was abreast of any In the
world. He showed this country's predom
inance in agriculture, manufacture and
mining. The country's universities anil
scientific schools, he said, were winning
honorable place. In all branches of in
dustry the country flourished, aire) it had
also flourished and been victorious in war.
He continued:
"Men? Sana in corpore sar.' â"A sound mine!
n a sound body." You are German born or of
German offspring. You are. imbued with cer
tain ideas and characteristics, and as j*OU are
a strong people these ideas and characteristics
could not be lost either by social Intermixture
or by intermarriage. With you the;, were the
results of the teachings of centuries, falling un
thinking, fruitful minds; the: had come to
you from rich yon Hutten, Hans Sachs, Mar
tin Luther, the great Frederick. Freiherr yon
Stein. Father Jahn. from Lessins. Schiller.
Goethe. Theodore Koerner. Helnrlch Heine,
fierwegh and Freiligrath., Alexander -â  in Hum
boldt, from Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert,
from Kant and Sohlegei and from Froebel and
hundreds of other illustrious men who gained
for Germany the sobriquet "A Nation of
Thinkers."
When in 1848 the best men in our Fatherland,
with a childlike faith in the aphorism that
"right must be might," dared life, liberty and
fortune, but failed in re-establishing ' German
unity, a tide of immigration eel in which
brought to this country such men as Friederleh
Hecker, Carl Schurz. Franz Slegel F. Sehuene
mann-Pott, Karl Heinzen. Friederrch Kapp,
Hassaureek and thousands of others of Ger
many's best blood. The eflect which this influx
, had on the social; industrial and political life
of this country could not be lost and can be
detected on every hand and In even' sphere
of the nation's life even at this day.
The Germans settleel in th> great Northwest,
they, supplied labor to our factories, they in
augurated new industrial ventures, among
which were chemical works, jewelry ami musi
cal Instrument factories, wire works Hike those
of tht â . rings, who bull! the Fast River
bridge) breweries and sugar refineries; they
planted our valleys with fruit trees and our
hillsides with the grapevine. It was greatly
due to the eloquence of Carl Schurz, who
stumped the States in 1860, that Abraham Lin
coln -was elected President. And when, in
consequence, the great war of the rebellion
broke out. Schurz left his post at Minister at
Madrid and hurried home to enlist as a private
s.elflier to fight for the union, together with
more than 100,00(J German-born American citi
zens. Entire regiments composed of Germans
went to the front from every part of the North
ern Stater. â and here let me say that nearly
every large city of the Middle and Western
States sent out a turner regiment, and that it
was the Turn Ver*ln of St. Louis which by
force of arms kept the State of Missouri nut of
the Confederacy. For this act of loyalty they j
were by the rebel element stigmatized as. the I
TURNERS GO THROUGH THE MASS EXERCISE AT GLEN PARK
One hundred and thirty gray-clad members of the Turn Vereins comprising the Pacific Turn Bezirk, under the leadership of Technical Leader Robert Barth,
won plaudits from the thousands at the Mission resort for their splendid work.
THE SAN FBA.NCISCO CALL, MO 3* PAY, JULY 31, 1899,
"damned Dutch of Missouri." In our latest
and present war also the Germans are well to
the front, for without having before one the
muster roll of the army one need but real the
list of casualties to know that citizens of Ger
man extraction are fully represented in the
field.
At this point let me refer to a matter of re
cent occurrence. Meetings have been held in
Chicago. Detroit, and other large cities in the
Fast of American citizens of German birth to
protest as "German-American" citizens against
certain pro-Anglican and anti-German reports
and insinuation's.-. While ail American citi
zens have the Inviolable right to meet for any
lawful purposeâ and this was a lawful one â
I think that they made a mistake when they
called themselves "German-American" citi
zens. That name is an anomaly; there is no
Herman-America, no more than there is an
Irish-America or an Italian-America: cense.
quently there can be no citizens of such name.
This is the I'nited States of America, the be
loved country .if our free choice, of. which we
are justly proud. Here we 'cast our ballot;
here we work, build our homes, raise our fami
lies an-1 acquire competencies. For this coun
try's preservation we have fought and are will
ing to fight again against all aggressors, who
ever they may be.
If England thinks it good policy to misrep
resent th.- Intentions of the German empire as
to this country I say "give the i all more
rope." The sequel will tell whether England
has not more to lose and is at heart not more
envious of America's greatness than Germany,
whiuh. by the way, is England's most danger
ous neighbor. 1 have implicit faith In the
people of this country, in its statesmen and
university professors; I have faith in our Em
bassador' at. Berlin. Andrew D. White, who
again and again has assured our Government
! that Germany is absolutely friendly to the
I United States.
â 
I love. the land of mv birth as well and as
much as any so-called "German-American' : I
am proud of its history, where it is creditable;
J am proud of its unification and the victories
on the battlefield that led thereto; 1 am proud
of Its great men in science ami art. of its
great seats of learning, of the gigaintic strides
it has made In industry and commerce. I love
this dear old. mother of mine, and my fondest
wish is to see. her once more, then to return
here to live and die an American citizen.
Mr. Denicke then spoke of the connec
tion, between German Turnweser and, this
country's -progressive force. He gave a
short history of the founding of tne organ
ization. by the men of '48.
In those days, he said, .there were no
gymnasiums. Athletics at school and
college were an unknown quantity. Box
ing was practiced, it is true, but only by
the professional -slugs-er. West Point and
Annapolis had each a fencing-master but
no instruction in physical culture. The
youth of both sexes were narrow-chested
and awkward; the girls especially were
pale, thin and delicate. The orthodox
churchâ In those days there was
hardly any otherâ with suspicion
on outdoor sports. Slowly but surely the
Turners' motto "Mens sana in corpore
sano," became-- understood. He pointed to
tip- universities and schools of the coun
try to bear him out In his assertion.
Mr. tlie-ke', who spoke 111 English, was
followed by Dr. Max Magnus, the bezerk
sprecher, who gave welcome to the vis
iting Turners an/i their friends in the
tongue of the fatherland. He said it did
his heart good to see such an outpouring,
which must be considered as the most
representative German gathering held
here for years. He called attention to the
fact that the active members of the
Turner organization contested not for
money or other Intrinsic valuables, but
for laurels on the field of honor.
"This is not only a Turner festival," he
said; "it is a popular festival (a volks
fest) in the true sense of the word. Be
sides the Turners there are the sharp
shooters, the singing societies and the
social and benevolent organizations, and
they are out In full force for the purpose
of showing that the German-Americans
of the Pacific Slope are not asleep; that
they are fully awake; that they have
earned the- citizenship fit" this their .adopt
ed country; that they are willing to de
fend at all hazards the rights and priv- 1
ileges thus earned. They know that In
the industries and the professions the
German-Americans have maintained first
rank, and they are proud that they have
hrought to tin- country of their adoption â 
the best gifts that the valerland could
offer.
"Not that we think ourselves better
than American citizens of other extrac
tions, but. with the firm "belief that if all
citizens of the United States feel As we
do. we need no alliance with any foreign
power: and thai this country will always
find its ally a- home in Its citizenship; and I
that we will concede to no i -111- the right !
to precede us in defending this country I
against foreign aggression."
Dr. Magnus asked for three cheers for j
"The I'nited States, th- country of i m j
adoption." They were given with a will,
and the audience settled down to listen to
the singing competition, in which the fol
lowing participated:
Singing section of the Oakland Turn
Verein. Henry Kaehler director; of the
San Jose Turn Verein; of the Mission
and San Francisco Turn Vereins. A. Han;,
director. The decision of the judge was
that the Oaklanders were the victors:

CONCERT AT TURN HALL.
. ,
Oakland Singing Section Had the
Place *-f Honcr.
The hall of the San Francisco Turn
Verein at "17 Turk street was crowded
; to the doors last night with a joyous
throng which sought fittingly to end the
day's festivities by lifting up their voices
in song. In the true German, way they
enjoyed themselves heartily. The many
voiced choruses that chanted the beloved
j songs of the fatherland were loudly ap
plauded by the happy audience.
- The gala- concert was opened with an
overture by the orchestra. Then a choir
of seventy voices, under the leadership
of Professor J. R. Rieggcr, took the
stage. Then followed the singers of the
, Germania Club, under Professor. P.
Engels. The Oakland Turn Verein, di
rected by Henry Kaehler, came next, sing:
ing the "Home Coming." Professor H.
Genss, with a chorus of fifty voices, pre
ceded the barytone solo of Turner John
Plagemann, which won prolonged ap
plause.
Minerva de Chent-Heuermann, later In
the programme, sang "Robert der Teu-
I," and Fraulein Kmelie i Xeubert also
rendered a beautiful soprano solo.
The Oakland verein. having won tne
first place in the singing contest in the
day's exercises, was given the place of
honor, that is, the singing of the last
number on the programme.
John Simmon. Daniel Frank and Justus
Herbst formed. the committee having the
concert In charge and. the success of the
affair is largely due to the efforts of these
gentlemen.
AT THE PARK AND CXIEF.
Big Crowds Enjoy a Day at the City's
Pleasure Grounds.
Yesterday was a quiet day at the park
and beach. . Although the day was pleas
ant and the crowds large, all were on
their good behavior. No accidents were
reported, neither was an arrest made.
Remembering the almost fatal accident of I
the Sunday before, the youngsters who I
assembled out by the ocean expended
their surplus energy . in pursuits other
than climbing the cliff. Cyclists were
also held down to the speed limit, and
not even a barked shin detracted from
the pleasure of a single wheelmen.
At the Chutes the usual big crowd as
sembled. Miss Johanna Frisco, the
Ourang-Ooutang, and two new snakes
from far away Australia, one of the car
pet species of great length, the other a
diamond head, were the attracting fea
tures. The vaudeville entertainment was
well patronized, as were the many other
si.!, attractions.
The results of the contests at Sutro
Baths follow: Fifty-yard dash, novice.
(} Freeth tirst: R. Took second: 100-yard
race, juvenile, 11. Seebach first. F. Freeth
second; special 120-yard race, non-profes
sional, won by D. Carroll: tub race, won
by VY*. Fisher, C. Augustus second. D.
Leepold third; trick and fancy spring
board diving, won by R. Cordell, R. Rid
ing second; diving for plates, won by (1.
Freeth, C. Augustus second.
Eahey Denies the Charge.
William Fahey. proprietor of the Cos
mopolitan Hotel, declares that the charges
of "colonizing" made against him are un
just and untrue. The gentleman states
that to his knowledge no person claims
a residence at his 'hostelry who has not
a right to be there, and that he has never
aided or abetted any "colonizing"
schemes. The proprietor admits that three
suspicious names are on the register from
his house, two of employes and another of
,-; guest who spends much time in the c ty.
but he says that he had no knowledge of
the registration"? at the City Hall.
Transfer of Oil Business.
The King Keystone Oil Company has
â¢succeeded to the business of f_,athrop &
King, at 116 Front street, where they will
be pknscd to continue to furnish their
patrons with petroleum and its products.
