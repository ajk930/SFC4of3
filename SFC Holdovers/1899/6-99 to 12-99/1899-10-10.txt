MARIN TOWNS MENACED
BY BLAZING FORESTS
Many Cottages Destroyed and the
Loss Will Reach at Least a
Half Million.
SAN" RAFAEL, Oct. 10.â
Luigi Ferari, a ranchhand, is
reported missing and believed
to have been caught in the
names. Constable Ga.gner was
seriously burned near Dr.
Warner's place.
MILL VALLEY, Oct. 9.â A forest
fire has been raging on Mount
Tama - since noon to-day, and
at a late hour to-night four square
miles of territory had b&en left a black
and smoking waste. Several cottages on
the outskirts of this place are- totally
destroyed, but 400 men are now fighting
the flames and the town is considered
safe as a whole. The fire threatens to
cross the ridge and destroy Larkspur and
Corte Madera on the east and Bolinas on
the west. In case the flames reach the
Stensor. ranch toward Bolinas, Incalcu
lable damage will be done and it least a
month will be required for the fire to
burn itself out. The damage has already
reached half a million dollars and that
estimate may be doubled by to-morrow.
The fire started at 11:40 a. m. near the
railroad tank half way up the mountain,
and was first discovered by a young son
of Colonel Savage, now at Manila. The
boy promptly Informed Manager Louis
I>. Janes of the Tamalpais Land and
Water Company and A. H. Mclnnes, who
hurriedly drove to where the fire had its
Inception, and seeing that the outlook was
serious sounded the fire alarm.
Word was sent M. Baker, manager o^
the construction department of the North
Pacific Coast Railway at Sausalito, and in
an hour's time 100 men were rushed to Mill
Valley by a special train. They were at
once joined there by 300 citizens, many of
them beir.g metropolitan business men.
and the work of fighting the flames, which
had by this time gained great headway,
was begun. Brush hooks, shovels, axes
and every other contrivance that could be
used was taken aiong, the women helping
the men gather them together.
The first residence endangered was that
of George White, who Is connected with
the cusrom-house. A young lady there
fought the flames with a garden hose, and
the house was saved by the arrival of the
lire fighters, though it is still within the
danger line to-night. The men at "once
began back-firing and drove the flames
toward the mountain: The flames then
Jumped 100 feet to George T. Marsh's
group of cottages, and In spite of hercu
lean work two cottages, known as th-"-
Owl's nest and the Cabin, were burned
to the ground. The thirty-three acres of
land covered with redwood timber and
owned by Marsh, who conducts a Japa
nese bric-a-brac store under the Palace
Hotel, were burned over, the entire loss,
including the cottages, amounting .to $30,
--600.
Mrs. H. B. Burnham. who lived in one
of the Marsh cottages, rushed an express
wagon to the scene and had all her house
hold goods removed. Though her cottage
lias not yet been burned it lies inside the
danger belt and may go up in smoke al
any minute. Everything was removed
from Mrs. L. A. Bishop's house, adjoin
ing Mrs. liurnham's. but It is believed
that her property will be saved. Every
thing at the Eastland Hotel is ready to
be removed at a minute's warning, but
back tiring will probably save this fash
ionable summer resort. Mrs. E. MofiTtt.
widow of the deceased wholesale butcher,
and Daniel B. Haves of the Fulton Iron
Works, have moved all their household
belongings to the county road near Alto
in order io be prepared for the worst. J.
W. Costlgah; the wheat hroker. played a
garden hose on his property and succeed
ed, with the assistance of the firemen,
in saving It from total destruction. Mr.
Martinet, who is connected with Scrlb
ner's Magazine, has a cottage nearby
which was in danger at a late hour.
All In all the fire has swept over a
stretch of four miles of territory, all of
which was considered good building sites,
valued at several hundred dollars an' acre.
Bnck-firir.g has probably saved Mill Val
ley, as the flames are now dying out on
this side of mountain, but it is feared
that by morning they may work their
way Into Baltimore Canyon and destroy
Corte Madera and - Larkspur. The Are
is at present principally confined to War
ners Canyon on th' east, but Is reach
ing out toward Bolinas 'ii the west and
Is now as far as the White Gate ranch
at Willow Camp, which opens into the
Stenson forest of 12.000 acres. If it gets
there It means that the flames cannot be
controlled for a month and must be
fought toward the ocean. On this ranch
are probably 1000 head of cattle, many of
which would doubtless be burned to
death. At a late hour 150 head of cattle
were driven off the Boyle ranch and
scattered long the county road between
Alto Station and Sausalito.
A panic prevailed here before it was
f.een that -firing would save all but
the outskirts of the town and there Is
not a residence where everything is not
packed and ready for moving. Many have
taken all their household goods out of
the valley and the county roads are lit
tered with furniture, pianos, bedding and
all portable articles for three miles. Wlih
the hardest labor and the best luck the
flames cannot be totally extinguished for
a week. ;: c
To-night the heavens are still crimson,
and at intervals a tongue of flame will
leap Into the air, accompanied by the
crashing sound of giants of the forest top
pling to the earth, and light the sur
rounding region for miles. The heaviest
loser by the fire is Sydney B. Cushing.
who will suffer to the tune of $250,000.
The Tamalpais Land and Water Company
will lose $160,000, and the remainder will
be borne by the owners of the cottages
and -mall patches of forest.
While the flames were burning fiercest

MANY HOMES AND
VINEYARDS DESTROYED
SAN JOSE, Oct, 9.â The fire which has
prevailed in the Santa Cruz mountains
for some days Is still burning to-day and
no one can tell where it will end. Under
the scorching sun and hot wind yesterday
it spread rapiAly and got far beyond con
trol. Many were out fighting to save
heir property and help went from here,
nut still there was a large loss. All
through the night the blaze could be seen
from San Jose. It was plainly visible at

6 this morning, but later in the day was
obscured by the heavy smoke which hangs
over the valley.
Statements differ as to the loss so far
caused, this being placed all the way
from <50,0u0 to $150,000; the latter figure is
probably too high. The scope of country
burned over is scattered so that It may
be a day or so before the estimate will
be accurate even if no more damage is
done. J. McCracken lost two residences
yesterday and several acres of vineyard.
Othtrs who have suffered loss are i:. O.
xocco, John Cave, C. H. Allen and E. F.
Adams. Vineyards especially suffer since
if the lire gets a sweep across them they
are utterly ruined.
A telephone message from Wrights
shortly before noon to-day stated that the
fire is raging fiercely again toward Los
Gatos Canyon. J. W. Lincoln and a Mr.
Moon have lost their residences. The
nearest fire to Wrights is in Austin
gulch, about a mile and a half away.
Great quantities of timber are being de
stroyed. Cnless the fire is checked soon
It may cause serious delay to the nar
row-gauge railroad. A big rain is prayed
Cor by tho people In the mountains.
SANTA CRUZ, Oct. 9.â A forest fire Is
reported to be raging at the head of La
guna Creek and another on Berry Creek,
near Valencia. The Hihn Company sent
a large force of men to fight the flames
encroaching on their land near Sulphur
Springs. The men, by back firing, are
endeavoring to keep the fire in Los Gatos
Canyon.
J. A. Hoffman's residence, eight miles
from Boulder Creek, was destroyed. The
lire Is now raging heavily in Spanish
gulch and heading toward Soquel Springs.
The house owned by a. Stamor on the
Cattermole place was totally destroyed.
There Is a demand for more men, as those
who have been fighting the flames are
well nigh exhausted after their struggle
of thirty-six hours.
At the Meyers winery 40,000 gallons of
wine were used In extinguishing the fire.
Vlneyardists in the burning territory
have sustained much damage, as the
grapes have been destroyed.
The fire now covers territory twelve
miles. Where It is now at Its height there
is a fine lot of timber. Great efforts were
made to prevent the fire crossing the road
at Soquel Canyon by felling trees and
back-firing, but the flames leaped over
the barricade this afternoon.
At Skyland men who were moving the
schoolhouse had to leave off work and re
spond to a call from neighbors whose
homes were in peril. F. R. Dann, whose
ranch near Vine Hill Is well known as the
summer resort called Mountain View
Ranch, had to wet down his houses, owing
to cinders. He remained up nearly all
night watching his property. Dunn says
the view from his place was superb, as
the flames would climb the redwood giants
and burst forth almost at their tops.
The weather Is growing cool, which

MYSTERIOUS WOMAN KNELT
BESIDE THE DEAD BURGLAR
Strange Incident at the Alameda Morgue Following
the Midnight Battleâ Captured Man Makes Ad=
missionsâ Good Service of Citizens.
ALAMEDA. Oct 9. -This city Is still
in a wild state of excitement over
last night's battle with the trio of
desperate burglars who attempted
to enter the store of A. O. Gott on
Park street. Although the police now
deny that there was a third man In the
affair, he was seen by so many both be
fore and after the conflict that the citi
zens refuse to believe that there is not
another criminal hiding in their midst
who will fight for his life if cornered.
The town is being carefully patrolled to
night by the police, augmented by a large
force of armed citizens, determined that
the third man of the trio shall not es
cape them.
Chief of Police Conrad and Officer Had
ley, who were wounded In last night's
affray, are not seriously hurt. The bul-
let that "truck Conrad took the skin off
his neck just over the jugular vein, while
Hadley will only lose the ends of two fin
gers of .his right hand as a result of his
part In the battle.
A strange Incident, which may lead to
the identification of at least one of the
desperadoes, occurred to-night. A mys
terious young woman entered the Morgue,
and hurrying to the slab, which bore the
remains of the dead burglar, knelt down
beside the corpse. Passionately pressing
her lips on the dead lips, the young
woman gave herself up to uncontrollable
grief. Finally regaining self-control, she
turned her eyes heavenward, and for sev
eral minutes seemed absorbed in silent
prayer. The official report of the Incident
was as follows:
After all the officials but the night dep
| uty had left the Morgue a woman about 23
years o*d, who answers the description of
I the orfe who accompanied the dead burg
i lar to this city Sunday night, visited the
place and viewed the corpse. She was
; very much affected, and knelt beside the
! coffin and prayed fervently and tearfully.
I The night deputy did not notice her, and
! she went away without disclosing her
j identity. Constable Gray had his atten
tion called to her, and followed her down
Park street as far as Armory Hall, where
he lost track of her. The officer searched
for her until after midnight, but she suc
cessfully evaded him. She -was dressed
in black and is a demi-blonde. She reached
Alameda by an electric car, and It was
thought she returned to Oakland. There
is no doubt but, that she knows the dead
burglar. .'-. ,^.'-" ; %*|;'c>
The captured man refuses to give his
name and denies acquaintance with the
dead burglar. All efforts to Identify
either have failed. Detectives from both
sides of the bay have visited the prison
and the Morgue to-day, but have been
unable to recognize the criminals. All
that is known concerning them is that
the dead man came from San Francisco
and that the j trio had been in Alameda
several days preparing for the Job which
resulted so disastrously, to them.
During the chase. all the eastern part of
the city was aroused from Its slumbers.
The popping of pistols, the crack of rifles
and the bang of shotguns broke the still
ness of the night. For over an hour there
was a running fire between the fleeing
burglars and their pursuers. The police,
appreciating that they had a desperate
Job on hand, called to their aid all the
citizens they could hastily â¢ awaken, and
others,* attracted by the fusillade, Joined
'In the chase. They were armed with
j every conceivable weapon from a coal
i shovel to a cannon. -.-'â¢'.
About 11:30 o'clock a roomer in the
â¢Methodist church .block on Park street
was attracted by a suspicious noise com
ing from the jewelry store of Gott on the
ground floor below. Peering out 'of the
back window, he noticed three men trying
to effect an entrance through a rear win
dow opening on to an alleyway running
along the side of the Methodist church.
The police were notified, and Officer Had
i ley, who was alone at the Central Sta
i tion, hastened to the place. He notified
i Officer Jesse Rogers, who was on the
! Park-street beat, to guard the front of
! the store while he went ; around to the
: alleyway in the rear. ; .
Hadley took a position on . the church
steps where he could command a view of
: the back of the ' Jewelry store. After
: waiting for some moments without results
ihe scaled a ten-foot fence dividing the
store yard â  from the alley and tried the
door. He found it unlocked and started
to enter. The burglars, who were on the
Inside, made a dash for him as soon as
he opened the door, and the first of the
series of desperate battles that followed
took place. Hadley jumped Dack to the
side of the doorway as the trio advanced
and opened fire with his pistol. Simulta
neously two of the crooks began shooting
at the officer, a oullet from one of their
weapons tearing away a portion of the
third and fourth Angers of Hadley's right
hand. Despite the pain from his wound
the officer stood his ground bravely and
tried to capture the men, but at the crit
ical moment his revolver refused to work,
and he hastily retreated. In scaling the
high fence he fell and dislocated his left ,
shoulder blade. The burglar who was
later landed In jail followed him.
Several men who had been attracted by
the shooting stood In the al'vyway when
the crook shoved ids head above the fence. !
Hadley passed his revolver to a bystander, ;
who attempted to use it on the burglar,
but it only had the effect of prompting ]
him to drop back into the yard, where he j
and his two companions began a race for !
their lives over the fences and out to
Alameda avenue.
From Alameda avenue the men ran to !
Oak street and thence to .the southern !
bay shore. On the way the missing burg
lar separated from the other two -and '
disappeared. Officer Brown overtook the '
fleeing pair as they were walking along
the beach at the foot of Walnut street.
He commanded them to surrender. and
the reply was a shot from- the man who ;
was subsequently killed, which just
grazed the officer's ear. The burglars
took to their heels, going in different ,
directions. Brown gave chase to the man
who had shot at him, leaving the other I
to an army of citizens who by that time |
had reached the scene y.
Brown's man scaled fences and went j
through back yards with the agility of a I
cat. The officer, kept close; in. the rear.
For blocks it was a i hurdle race between !
the two. Brown taking a shot at the flee- !
ing man every ' time he showed his i head '
and the burglar returning the Are with !
alarming regularity. - Armed citizens took j
a pep at the burglar as he passed through j
their premises, but failed to scratch. him.
He finally made his way to a vacant lot,
corner of Central avenue â¢ and Walnut
street, where he was lost sight of during
the temporary shutting off of the electric
lights.: The lot was surrounded, however,
and every avenue of escape was guarded
Chief Conrad took command of the
forces at this stage of the battle. Feel
ing sure that his man was hiding near the
fence along Central avenue, Conrad, in a
stooping posture, went along the line of
pickets hoping to catch a glimpse In the
darkness of the hunted burglar. He was
followed by C. P. Magagnos. When op
posite a break in the fence, about fifty
yards from the corner of '.Walnut street,
Conrad was surprised by the flash of a
pistol shot coming from the other side of
the fence and so close to his head that
the powder almost burned his flesh. The
officer's revolver was strapped to his side
in a swivel holster, and without removing
It he turned it on' the crouching figure
and began to pump lead as fast as he
could work the trigger. Magagnos did
likewise. The last shot in Conrad's gun
struck the burglar in the thigh, and with
a gruntâ not a groanâ he stumbled
through the fence on to the sidewalk.
Conrad jumped behind a telegraph pole to
reload his pistol. The wounded man. with
coolness and deliberation that was re
markable, carefully ejected the empty
shells from his revolver, inserted another
cartridge, and as the officer stepped from
his shelter he rested his weapon on his
arm, and, taking careful aim at the chief,
fired his last shot. S The bullet took the
skin off Conrad's, neck, just over, the
jugular vein. â¢ Conrad cried out that he
was. shot, but never faltering rushed
toward the prostrate burglar, firing as he
went. .One of his. bullets, took effect' In

NEW YORK, Oct. There was a
buoyant feeling of expectancy
among the yachtsmen to-night,
not that they feel sure of a race
to-morrow but that they know
i every day will be a race day frOm now
I out to the finish, with the exception of
Wednesday. The agreement of the re-
I gatta committee and the Shamrock and
| Columbia people has proved popular. It
; Is a fair proposition and every one likes
the manner In which it is met.
This has. been a foggy day down around
the Horseshoe and everything has been
quiet with the fleet there, except on the
decks of the Columbia, where the crews
have been cutting and refitting sails.
This is taken In yachting circles to Indi
cate nervousness. There is nothing to" be
] gained In trying to put aside facts. They
! are worrying on. the Columbia: they are
: calm and confident on the Shamrock. The
j reason for all this is that the English
! boat has done the better work on the
: three days of the flukes. Look at it from
. whatever standpoint you will these
plain facts stare you In the face. On two
j of the days, at the moment the signal
j "race off" was set the Shamrock was in
i the lead. On the third day she was no
I worse than on even terms. Indeed, the
: weight of opinion is that she was ahead,
' considering her position and the fact that
! she started, some seconds behind the Co
i lumbia. Add to this her time allowance
I of six seconds and the chances are still
I more in her favor. There Is good reason
I for nervousness among the Americans,
! and nothing has occurred to-day to di
minish It. It Is an unpleasant truth, but
It is Just as well to admit it.
- The weather Is the important thing now.
Three days of drifting have changed the
character of the speculation. It Is now
: quite as much a question will there be a
race as which will win. The weather
man In Washington promises a southerly
Increasing breeze. If It comes It will be
a welcome wind to thousands of yachts
men who have come many miles to wit
ness the contest. If this prediction is ful
t filled the racers will be sent over the line
- ! to- windward dewn-'the:* Jersey coast, the
course the; same as Saturday, but: the
order of sailing la reversed, the first leg
being. to. windward with a run home. This
j will be more satisfactory, as it gives a
; better chance for skill in maneuvering for
! the weather berth at the start. â¢ - -
The fog siren at Sandy Hook emitted
its doleful warning all to-day through the â 
layers of mist. Dreary as the day was.
it broke at least the rule of a good wind
on off days and calms on racing days, and
on all sides there was hope that the wind
for once would be good and true on the
day of days. The weather observers for
once kept - their hands for a time off j
the business of signaling. Both Mr.
Iselin and Sir Thomas Upton appreciate
all that they have done for them, but i
that hurricane bulletin which the weather
men rushed in on Sunday caused worry
on both sides. The hurricane turned out
to be a stretch of fog which settled down
over the sea. - .
As soon as Hathaway's sailmakers got ,
through with the alterations on the Co
lumbia's mainsail this morning the sail
was hauled up from below, bent to the
mast, boom and gaff hoisted.

Ameer of Afghanistan Sanctions Brutal

LONDON, Oct. 10.â The Dally Telegraph's St. Petersburg correspondent says
Russian accounts represent Abdur Rahman Khan, Ameer of Afghanistan,

In the meantime his companion had

beach. He was hiding under a clump of
rose bushes and surrendered to Officers
Brampton and Rogers and Citizen McÃea.
without a struggle. His captors landed
him at the jail just as his partner ex
pired. He was taken before the blood
covered corpse and asked by the chief of
he recognized the dead man. He tell
back and gasped and then, as if by a
superhuman effort, he regained his com
posure and denied emphatically that he
had ever seen the man. He gave the
name of Jim Jones, but refused to tell
anything about himself or his movements.
Burglar tools were found on both men,
but the captured burglar In his flight had
thrown away his revolver. The dead man
carried an imitation Smith & Wesson of
38 caliber with a six-inch barrel. Among
his effects was a villainous weapon made
from the single blade of a pair of scissors
ground down to a point as sharp as a
needle. A similar instrument was picked
up to-day along the line of the chase.
Since the escape of the third man the
police claim that there were but two men
in the battle, but this is denied emphatic
ally by a host of witnesses who saw the
trio both before and after their attempt to
burglarize Gott's store.
, The dead man was seen coming to
Alameda on Sunday night on the broad
gauge train. He was accompanied by a
flashily dressed woman, who disappeared
shortly after they reached the Park
street station. The crook who lost his
life was about 30 years of age, height 5
feet 6 inches, dark hair, with reddish
tinge at roots, i brown eyes, sallow com
plexion, weight about 130 pounds. He .Is
presumed to have been an opium fiend.
He was stylishly dressed In a dark blue
coat and vest, striped gray pants and
wore a soft black hat. A return ticket to
San Francisco was found on him. His
shirt bore the laundry mark "K. O. G."
He has a scar over the right eye and his
upper teeth are false.
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
Iselfn and Captain Barr, It was decided
that the sail was not yet fit to do battle
to-morrow; so it was lowered and after
some minor alterations it was hoisted
again at 3 p. m., when it set almost as
flat as a board, except for a few wrinkles
up near the beam under the gaff.
The new club topsail was also bent, but
not hoisted. It was made up on the yard
and covered to keep it dry, for the air was
full of what old sailors call "Scotch mist,-
The mainsail was lowered soon after 4
o'clock, stowed on the boom and covered
fcr the night.
C. Oliver Iselin arrived from the city on
a tug just before noon. When seen on
board the St. Michaels soon after, he said:
"We are all hoping for a breeze to-mor
row, so that we may finish at least one
race. I should like to get through be
fore' Chrjstmas."
Asked if the arrangement to race every
clay after Thursday was satisfactory to
him. he said: "Yes, indeed, we are only
too glad to be able to race every day and
finish up the series."
Mr. Iselin did not care to make any
comment on the last race, further than
to say that some of the newspaper criti
cism of the Columbia's tactics were un
fair and uncalled for. The Columbia's
crew, he said, were all well and eager for
the next race.
"If we have a good steady breeze," said
he, "I have every confidence in the
yacht."
The docking of the yachts between
races, which was the original intention If
they showed signs of becoming foul, will
have to be abandoned on account of the
new arrangements. It may be as fair for
one as the other, as it now stands, say
the' owners, who feel that what little
growth may have accumulated can make
very little difference in the sailing of the
two yachts.
Sir Thomas Lipton remained on board
the Erin all day. He did not deny him
self to visitors, but gave all his usual
courteous greeting when they came up
the gangway. He was expecting to at
tend a private dinner given in his honor
to-night at one of the big hotels in the
city, but sent a telegram to the gentle
man who was to be his host begging to
be excused until after the races had been
sailed, as he was centering all his efforts
on the task before him. and did not want
to leave Sandy Hook until after to-mor
row's race anyway.
Sir Thomas has been the recipient of
many hundreds of cablegrams from
friends on the ether side of the water con
gratulating, him on the fine showing the
Shamrock has made in light weather, and
every time a big batch of dispatches is
brought from shore those on the Erin
have a good time reading them; for among
them are many humorous ones. This
morning the usual number came, and by
far the most amusing was one from Eng
land saying. "Never mind the hairpins;
bring back the cup."
Sir Thomas inquired about the betting,
and expressed satisfaction that the Sham
rock stock was going up. He did not
offer any tips, but reiterated his former
statements that his boat would be sailed
to win and that there would be no hold
ing up at the wire. Sailmaker Ratsey
watched the tinkering on the Columbia's
mainsail with a critical eye. but did not
express any opinion for publication.
.Herbert C. Leeds visited Sir Thomas
this afternoon and spent some time with
him. The best of feeling exists between
the Columbia and the Shamrock, and it
ems to be the desire of both that the
better boat shall win. ,-
Sir Thomas will entertain another large
party on board the Erin during to-mor
row's race. .
His companion is a rough-looking fel

ing between 165 and 170 pounds. His hair
Is black, bushy and inclined to curl. He

WARDEN AULL IS
SUMMONED BY DEATH
For the Past Year His Health Has Gradually
Been Failing and Physicians Have
Worked in Vain.
THE LATE CHARLES AULL
SACRAMENTO. Oct. 9. - Charles
Aull, Warden of Folsom Peniten
tiary, died at his residence there'
at 2:45 o'clock this afternoon. Fif
teen minutes prior to his death the
report was sent out that the War
den was dying, but it was at that time
believed that the end would not come un
til to-morrow morning.
The death of Warden Aull Is regarded
In Sacramento In the light of the loss of
one if Its own best citizens, for the War
den was held In the highest esteem here
and his acquaintance was widespread.
Those to whom the news came as a per
sonal sorrow recall the fatalism which
seems to have settled upon the Warden's
household. Six or seven years ago there
were not in all California two sisters of
such radiant beauty, grace of manner and
rare mental cultivation as Mrs. Charles
Aull and Mrs. P. A. Humbert. They, with
their husbands, constituted a most happy
household, and the guest at their table
deemed himself fortunate In having been
surrounded by such charming' hostesses
and hospitable hosts. â  r.Â»v.'
Pierre Humbert was the originator of
the plans for the great Folsom dam and
canal, but before that vast work had been
finished, and while he was still In his
prime, death overtook him and then, while
In the very height of her beauty, Mrs.
Humbert also succumbed to death.

thought they detected In her a change
from the hour her sisters body was con
signed to the earth. Probably this may
not have been, but nevertheless within
shortly over a year Mrs. Aull followed
her Bister in death. Then again it seemed
that death, still unsatlated, had beckoned
to Charles Aull.
From a robust man in the very perfec- I
tion of health, to all appearances, he I
faded into a mere semblance of his former \
self. Sojourns at various watering places I
availed little to Improve his condition and !
his decline had been gradual up to the j
hour of his own death to-day.
Warden Aull was but a few months I
past 50 years of age. He was a native of !
Clay County, Missouri. In 1875 he was ap- ]
pointed turnkey of the San Quentln prison
and during his four years of service there 'â 
held nearly every position in the prison.
Political change occurring, Mr. Aull en
tered the service of Wells, Fargo & Co.,
and made a fine reputation as a detec
tive. In November, 1583, he was appointed
Warden of San Quentln prison, serving
four years. He was then selected as War
den of Folsom prison and he has filled !
the position through successive adminis- !
trations, both Republican and Democratic, \
making for his prison the name of one of
the very best managed penal Institutions
In the United States.
It is said' that a successor to Warden
Anil may be elected at a meeting of the
Prison Directors at San Quentln next Sat
urday, although there has not yet been
even' a suggestion here as' to his probable
successor, the death of the Warden hav
ing fallen as a heavy shock upon the of
ficials and civilians alike.
ADVANCE UPON
THE FILIPINOS
American Forces Within
Sight of Malabon.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MANILA, Oct. 9.â General Schwan's col
umn, consisting of the Thirteenth In
fantry, a battalion of the Fourteenth In
fantry, two troops of cavalry, Captain
Reilly's battery of the Fifth Artillery and
Lowe's scouts, continued the advance to
il, iv toward San Francisco de Malabon,
meeting with little resistance and suffer
ing no casualties. The enemy fell back
steadily. ;. â ''--.
The .American camp to-night is within
sight of San Francisco de Malabon, the
stronghold of the insurgents in the pro
vince of Cavite, where the Filipinos are
said to number 5000. .;:">..
During the march from Noveleta to
Rosario only a few shots were fired. This
large -'east town was literally filled with
white flags. The Americans captured
two or three hundred men, many of the
Filipinos changing their clothing for
white costumes. The bay of Rosario was
filled with hundreds of boats and the peo
ple had spent an exciting night.
This afternoon a body of insurgents
was seen near La Lonia Church, four
miles from the heart of Manila. They
opened fire, the bullets falling among the
tents of the Twenty-fifth Infantry. The
Americans manned the trenches and re
plied a -range of 1200 yards.. The in
surgents volleyed and the Americans
used their artillery. The tight lasted an
hour, after which the Insurgents retreat
ed. One man was wounded. The scouts
of the Twentieth Infantry were sent to
reconnoiter.

MANILA, Oct. 9.â Lowe's scouts, sixty
men in all, and Captain McOrath'a troop
of the Fourth Cavalry, dismounted, crept
Into Cavite Viejo at 7:3o. o'clock Sunday
morning and took the place without op
position. The main column of General
Schwan, comprising the entire Thirteenth
Infantry, a battalion of the Fourteenth, a
mounted troop of the Third Cavalry- and
part of Reilly's Battery, a total of more
than 1500 men, marched out of Rlnacayan
at 10::10 o'clock on their way to Cavite
Vlejo and Noveleta. The gunboats Wheel
ing. Petrel and Callao shelled Noveleta
and Santa Cruz as a preliminary to the
troops' advance.
The marching column struck the enemy
and found them strongly entrenched. !
Through the water, bamboo thickets and
rice fields the American soldiers charged
on the trenches. They could not see the
enemy, who showered Mauser bullets
upon them. A brass cannon, loaded with
scrap Iron, was fired upon Captain Mc-
Grath's troops at less than 200 yards*
range. One officer was killed and another
had a leg shattered by an Iron nut that
pierced it. Captain Charles W. Fenton,
aid to General Fred Grant, was shot
through the ear, and ten enlisted men
were wounded. The enemy abandoned
their trenches, having suffered consider
able loss. -
While this fight was in progress two
battalions of marines, under Colonel El
liott, moved from Cavite southward to
ward Noveleta. They struck the enemy
on a narrow road In the midst of a
Swamp. Unable to throw out a flanking
force, they charged straight at the in
surgents through swamp and all. They

MARCONI IN
READINESS FOR
THE YACHTS
Changes His Sending Ap
paratus to the Steamer
Grand Duchesse.
SERVICE IS IMPROVED
Will Be Able to Send Many More
Bulletins and Give a Much
Better Report Than the
Shore Watchers."
Epeclal Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Oct. Starting anew
to-morrow, Marconi will make his
headquarters on the steamship
Grand Duchesse, from which all
bulletins of the future yacht race*
will be sent to the Herald and The
Call. So great an Interest has the public
taken In the practical operation of wire
less telegraphy that it was thought best
to transmit from the Grand Duchesse. In
consequence the Ponce will make no more
excursion trips, but the larger steamer,
the Grand Duchesse, will amply accom
modate all who desire to make the run
on her.
The Grand Duchesse will leave her pier,
Just above Desbrosses street ferry slip, at
9:30 o'clock to-morrow morning, and be
ing a remarkably fast traveler will arrive
at the starting line thirty minutes before
the signal is fired. : This will . give her
passengers a full opportunity to see the
jockeying for position, which is often the
most interesting part of the race.
Just as soon as it became known that
Marconi would himself have command of
the work on the Grand Duchesse the de
mand for tickets greatly Increased. Here
tofore an assistant has been on this
steamship, most of the work being done
from the Ponce. To-morrow, however,
from the moment the Grand Duchesse
leaves her pier until she returns to It at
night wireless telegraphy will be in con
stant operation on the Grand Duchesse,
which means that a new record will be
made in the number of words transmitted.
During the six hours that will probably
elapse after the first preliminary move is
made before the winning craft reaches
the final mark, fully 4000 words will be
sent to the receiving stations at Naveslnk
Highlands. Those on the Grand Duchesse
will have an opportunity of watching the
new process, although during the actual
race, when the operators will be very
busy, the apartment from which bulletins
will be sent will be closed except to those
actually at work. Later the exclusive
ness will be relaxed. Marconi had his
sending apparatus transferred from the
Ponce to the Grand Duchesse, the in
stallation being completed this evening,
when signals were exchanged with the
station at Naveslnk Highlands. Every
thing worked perfectly. After the tests
Marconi looked up at the towering mast
of the Grand Duchesse, and smiling com
placently said: "I would guarantee to
signal from this ship as now equipped to
the Highlands if we were 200 miles out at
sea. his is a magnificent mast of just
the right height for my purpose. We'll
make a record to-morr,ow. I'm glad, too,
that we're on a faster craft, for I've a
notion that the Shamrock will lift the
long-coveted cup and I want to see the
start. On the Ponce we missed two of
the starts last week. However, the
Grand Duchesse is large enough and fast
enough for an Atlantic liner,' and I look
forward to a pleasant day even though
we will have to do much hard work."
With Marconi on the Grand Duchesse
to-morrow will be the representatives of
the signal corps, who are eager to wit
ness some of the severe tests which have
been promised. There will be present
also one or more navy officers. Telegrams
were received late to-night from Wash
ington. New Orleans and St. Louis ask
ing that accommodations bo reserved on
the ship. From Washington will come a
party of fifteen for Thursday's race, while
New Orleans and St. Louis parties will
make the trip Friday. In every case
announcement was made that the desire
to see the wireless telegraph In opera
tion was greater than the interest in the
yacht race.
Captain Norton, who has the excursion
in charge, guarantees that the Grand
Duchesse will at all times be kept in tho
best position for watching the maneu
vers of the competing yachts. This will
make the bulletins to-morrow of extra
ordinary Interest, particularly as the
yachts may run straight out to sea.
Should such a course be laid, shore
watchers would have little to do, while
the general public In New York and San
Francisco would have to depend entirely
on the Herald and The Call bulletins for
news of the race.
drove the Filipinos away. One of the
marines was killed In this engagement
and twelve were wounded. Squads of ma
rines were sent from this point into Nove
let a.
Almost simultaneously with the move
ment of General Schwan westward, a
battalion of the Fourth Infantry, led by
Captain Cowles, marched eastward from j
Imus and captured San Nicolas after a
sharp fight with the insurgents for forty
live minutes. Four men were wounded
during the encounter. The bodies of six
insurgents were found on the field.
MANY LIVES ARE
LOST BY DROWNING
MANILA. Sept. 4.â The army In Luzon
has lost more men during the past fort
night by drowning than by bullets. All
the little streams which In the dry season
are mere creeks have become swift, wide
' rivers with unexpected and treacherous
currents and eddies. Ten colored soldiers
of the Twenty-fourth Infantry were
drowned at the Marlqulna River on tho
22d of August In an accident exactly
duplicating the loss of' five soldiers in the
Pasig River three months ago. Soldiers
are conveyed across the streams on bam
boo rafts whose motive power is a rope
stretched between the banks. In both
case's the ropes broke, the rafts were over
turned and part of the soldiers weighted
down with guns, haversacks and heavy
ammunition belts were unable to reach
the shore. Private J. E. Poole of the
Twenty-fourth lost his life in attempting
to rescue his comrades. He swam to the
shore and secured a small raft, which he
poled into the river, but was himself
pulled into the water and drowned by a
soldier he was trying to lift aboard the
raft. The last of the bodies of the ten
soldiers were recovered In the river this
week and all have been burled With mili
tary honors. >-'.â .â¢>." k
Four men of the : Third Infantry, sta
tioned at Quingua, were drowned in tho
Ragbag River before daylight on the
morning of the 17th, when the regiment
was starting against the forces of Pilar
which were threatening the railroad near
Malolos. Corporal Peter Larson was the
hero of this accident. He was drowned
in a brave effort to save others, and Lieu
tenant Chauncey B. Humphreys rescued
several of his men by great efforts and
i was himself nearly drowned during the
work. The regiment started from Quin
gua at 3 In the morning and swam the
Ragdbag River carrying their guns, HO
rounds of ammunition and haversacks.
The river is wide and shallow arid most
of the distance was fordable. but the cur
rent had become so swift that many were
carried off their feet. Seventeen were
compelled to drop their guns to get across.
Corporal Larson had reached the farther
shore when he heard the cries of the
drowning men and plunged back with his
gun still strapped to his back. He carried
one man of his company to safety and
turned back a second time. He was heard
to say: "I don't think I can make It, but
I'll try." He reached midstream and was
struggling to bring out another helpless
private, when both sank and were lost.
Most of the men took off their shoes be

LEFT THE CENTURY
MARK FAR BEHIND
Remarkable Life of Mrs. Percilla Nelson,
Who Died at the Age' of One
Hundred and Thirty.
MRS. PERCILLA NELSON, the Aged Negress Who Died at Marysville
MARYSVILLE, Oct. 9.â Mrs. Percllla Nelson, who died In Marysville on Sep
tember 30, was regarded as a wonder by the colored population and the com
munity In general, as she claimed to have, made a stay on earth almost equal
to twice the time of the Biblical allotment. The death certificate on file in the
Coroner's office fixes her age at the time of her death at 130 years.
A few months before she passed away, in conversation with the Call corre
spondent she stated that she was born in Cocke County, East Tennessee. She
first saw the light of day March B. 1769, on the Conaway plantation, her mother
being a slave owned by William Conaway. At the age of 19 she was married
to Henry Carmlchael, by whom she had one child. At the end of a year the
partner of her Joys and sorrows was sold to a trader and carried down the
river. After which she was sold to a planter named Pomeroy across the Mis
souri River. By her second husband, Nathaniel Nelson, nine children were born
to her. Of her third master, William H. Russell, she always had a kind word,
as life with him was next to liberty. It was on his plantation that her hus
band left her while he came to California, where In two years he earned enough
money to purchase the freedom of his family and bring them to the Golden State.
That was in 1554. At Sacramento, they conducted a laundry business for two
years and later settled in San Joaquin County, where the husband and three
of the children died. The last twenty years of her life was spent In Marys
ville.
She was able to move about the house and take exercise to within foui
months of her death. In her time the world of Invention noted the advent of
the steamboat, locomotive, telegraph and telephone. In the cause of humanity
the shackles were stricken from her people, and where In her prime all people
of African descent were held In bondage now all are free and equal. Truly
some great changes were observed by "Granny" Nelson, now dead.

NO CENSORSHIP ON
PHILIPPINE MESSAGES
WASHINGTON, Oct. 9.â The censor
ship of prass dispatches to and from Ma
nila has been abolished. This announce
ment was made at the War Department
to-day. It followed an expression of feel
ing by the naval officers on duty here at
what they thought an Inadequate report
In the press dispatches this morning of
the 'Part played by the marines In the
military operations of yesterday it be
ing charged that General Otis' jealous
blue pencil was again at work.
When this matter was brought to the
attention of Adjutant General Corbin he
stated that no censorship of press dis
patches has existed since September 9
and that the correspondents In the Phil
ippines are now allowed to send any in
formation they desire.
Undoubtedly the "round robin" protest
of the correspondents, published in July
was largely responsible for the removal
of the censorship. The authorities have
insisted that no instructions have been
sent to General Otis looking to Its re
moval. It is stated that the first sug
gestion came from General Otis on July
26, eight days after the correspondents

CHANGES IN THE
TRANSPORT SERVICE
â HONOLULU. Oct. 2.-When Captain
Trask arrives at Manila with the trans- !
port Aztec he will probably receive orders
to return to Honolulu Instead of San
Francisco, as has been the rule hereto
fore. The Government is reported to have
decided to adopt the new. plan of keeping
two steamers for horses and mules plying
constantly between here and Manila and
two between here and the coast. The Az
tec Is believed to be one of those selected
for the Manila end of the journey. The I
Leelanaw and Centennial are to run be
tween her and San Francisco and one
other steamer will keep the Aztec com* '
pany. â -,-.;;<,
The object of the new arrangement is to
give the horses a rest on land here in the
middle of their long voyage without hav
ing a steamer lie idle in port while the
horses recuperate. . Uncle Sam Is paying
very high for his transports, and the dally
bills for them pile up Just the same
whether they are hastening across the
sea or lying idle at the wharf. The ex
pense of simply the charter price of a
! vessel like the Aztec amounts to over
$5000 In tho time it takes for the horses
to get Into condition .for, another start.
Under the new arrangement the trans
ports that run between here and San Fran-
I cisco will land their animals here and go
j back for more. The 'result will be a large
I stock of horses and mules : on hand here
! all the time, from which the Aztec and
i her companion may draw. The animals
i may then have weeks; ashore instead
I of days, as the San Francisco transports
will get ahead of the Other two.

Spsciai Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Oct. 9.â The complete dearth
of news from the Cape, on which all at
tention Is riveted, is partly compensated
for by the mass of minor details pub
lished concerning the preparations for
the dispatch of the army corps and spec
ulation as to the length nnd character of
the debates when Parliament meets. In
official circles there is said to be appre
hension that the radicals will offer pro
tracted opposition to the Government's
policy In South Africa, which will pos
sibly make prorogation and Christmas
near neighbors.
Lord Salisbury's whip to the Lords, is
sued to-night, says Parliament will deal
with matters of grave moment.
The latest dispatch from Lourenzo
Marques, relating to the chasing of the
steamer Guelph by the cruiser Philomel
caused some stir, especially as it was
announced thai the Guelph had landed
at Durban 414 cases of ammunition for
the Boers. There Is a pretty general
feeling that ammunition ought not to be
allowed to be forwarded. The Pall Mall
Gazette, referring to tho matter, says:
"There is some hope that the ammunition
will be seized at Durban, as Natal pos
sesses a Ministry whose loyalty is un
questioned. Had not he Filipinos be.
given arms by Americans with which to
fight Spain Gener.'il Otis would long ago
have been enjoying his ease at home.
Similarly with the Boers. We may have
to pay heavily in blood for the apathy the
Cape Government has exhibited in this
matter."
Lord Wantage, president of the British
Red Cross Society, will shortly issue an
appeal for contributions to aid in the
â¢work of the society, which he says will
provide two hospital trains and a hospital
ship. The Duke of Westminster anÂ«! Lord
Wantage have given 1000 pounds sterling
each, and Baron Rothschild has raised
11,000 pounds sterling among his friends.
Some indication of the War Office esti
mate of the duration of the campaign is
given by the fact that the authorities
have contracted for eight months' sup
plies of bread in d other military requisi
tions rendered necessary by the absence
of the army service corps, which the War
Office thus evidently calculates will be at
home again by the beginning of May.
It appears that although the War Office
called upon 35,000 reservists, only the pick
of them, some 5000, will be retained with
the colors. The authorities are pleased
nt the application of a number of re
servists belonging to the Union mobilized
classes who are volunteering for foreign
service. The War Office announces that
the wives of reservists will get sixpence
and each child twopence daily while the
husbands and fathers are retained with
the colors.
Baron Tweedmouth presided at a meet
ing of the Council of London Radicals to
night, which, after a speech by Lord
edmouth deploring the unwise policy
of the Government, whose dispatches he
declared were not couched In conciliatory
term:-, adopted a resolution In favor of ar
bitration and calling upon the Govern
ment to take steps tending to a settle
ment of the difficulty with the Transvaal
by negotiations for arbitration.
KRUGER REGARDS THE
SITUATION AS VERY GRAVE
PRETORIA, Oct. 9.â President Kruger.
in the course of an interview to-day, said
he regarded the situation as very grave
and considered it very difficult to predict
coming events. The landing of British
reinforcements in Natal, he said, did not
trouble him, as he had full faith in the
Almighty. Mr. Kruger declared he knew
nothing of the reported Intention of Mr.
Hofmeyer, the Afrikander leader, and J.
Rose Innes, Under Secretary of Naval
Affairs in South Africa, to come to Pre
toria, and that there was nothing further
regarding the suggested arbitration by
the United States. President Kruger will
celebrate his seventy-fifth birthday to
morrow.
State Secretary Reltz to-day said that
negotiations were pending regarding me
diation by the United Slates but that
nothing had been decided.

PRESIDENT LAYS CORNERSTONE OF
CHICAGO'S NEW FEDERAL BUILDING
Chicago's New Federal Building as It Will Appear When Completed,
CHICAGO, Oct. 9.â Surrounded by 1 <
men who guide the diplomatic rela- | <
tions of three governments, and In ; J
the presence of thousands of spec- .
tators, President William McKinley L
i to-day formally laid the corner- <
: stone of the magnificent new Federal i
building of Chicago. The event was the j i
! crowning feature of the week's celebra- i '
tion, marking the annual observance of (
Chicago day.
Long before the hour set for the cere- ,
monies the streets surrounding the block i
on which the steel skeleton of the new i
building stands were packed from curb to '
curb with pushing. Jostling people anxious i
to get a glimpse of the nation's President
and the distinguished visitors from other j ,
countries, while every window in the gayly j ]
decorated skyscrapers surrounding the '
Federal building was taken advantage of.
Even on the steel girders of the Federal '
! building Itself were perched hundreds of â¢
venturesome spectators.
In the angle formed by the south and
west wings of the Federal structure at
Jackson boulevard and Dearborn street,
and in front of the Union League Club ;
building reviewing stands had been erect
ed for the accommodation of the dis
: tinguished visitors; including Vice Presi- ,
dent Mariscal and party of Mexico, Pre- .
mier Laurier of Canada and other no- 1
tables of that country; members of Presi-
I dent McKinley's Cabinet and the diplo
matic corps at Washington. Senators and
I Congressmen, and when President Mc-
I Kinley threw the first trowel of mortar
] under the uplifted block of stone. and pro- '
i nounced It set, one of the most notable
I gatherings ever in Chicago looked on.
Shortly before 10 o'clock a roar of cheer- ;
i ing from down Jackson boulevard an- '
nounced the coming of President McKin- '
! ley ami his party. It was with consider- '
i able difficulty that the troops of cavalry
j and the police forming the President es- I
| cort could clear a space wide enough for !
1 the carriages containing him and mem- 1
j hers of his Cabinet and other guests I
! to pass, and as the carriages slowly made i
I their way up the boulevard toward the '
! Federal building the applause became tor- i
i ritlc and continuous. The President fre
i quently doffed his hat In response. 1
I At the entrance of the Union League
! Club the President and the members of .
; his party alighted and after a brief re- ,
1 ception were escorted across Jackson ,
1 boulevard to the platform in front of tho ,
i Federal building. A perfect hurricane of i
! cheers greeted the President as he was i
: escorted to the dais, at the side of which i
! the cornerstone was suspended ready for i
| the ceremony. The President warmly
I greeted the officials, then turned and
i bowed to the group of brawny-armed
j workmen who were to complete the laying ;
of the cornerstone.
I Judge Christian C. Kohlsaat, chairman '
jof the committee on ceremonies, Intro- '
duced Secretary of the Treasury Lyman j
; J Gage as presiding officer for the cor- ,
i nerstone exercises. The Secretary was
I warmly cheered as he Stepped forward ,
i and made a brief address. Postmaster
i General Smith also spoke.
1..- acute coJ-emonics of the laying of '
'â  the cornerstone began then.
C. E. Kremer, secretary of the Federal 1
j committee, formally announced that the <
1 stone was ready, and read the list of '
I articles placed within it. President Mc- '
! Kinley was introduced by Secretary Gage, â¢
: and as he stepped forward to receive the
; trowel from the hands of Architect Henry : '
I Ives Cobb the crowds again burst forth
â¢ into cheers, the applause not ceasing un
i til the President raised his band. The
! President then stepped to the Bide of the ,
i uplifted mass of Illinois limestone and ;
j taking a trowel full of mortar from the
I board, he threw it on the base of the ,
i stone. As he did so a band stationed in ,
j the reviewing stand played "The Star i
Spangled Banner," and as the notes of .
- the national anthem were heard the
i crowd again broke Into cheers, the noise
I almost drowning the music. President
: McKinley pronounced the stone set, and
I resumed his seat as the workmen settled
the stone in Its place. .Senator William
i E. Mason made a brief address on behalf
j of the city of Chicago, and the ceremonies -
I concluded with a benediction by Rev. Dr.
i Gtinsaulus.
President McKlnley and party were then
j escorted to the Union League Club, where
I fhe President was the guest of the Federal
j committee at luncheon.
The military, naval and civic parade
. this afternoon was reviewed by President
McKinley, Don Ignacio Mariscai. Minister
of Foreign Affairs of Mexico; Premier
Laurier of Canada and other distin
guished guests of the city of Chicago. The
day was fine and the line of march was
I jammed with spectators windows, roofs
and every available space whore a foot
hold could be secured being occupied. The
parade began to form as the ceremonies
of laying the cornerstone of the Federal
building were being concluded.
The procession was led by Chief of Po

police-. Following came the Mexican band
of forty-eight pieces and the American
band of sixty pieces preceding Chief Mar

M'KINLEY AND LAURIER
MAKE TELLING SPEECHES
CHICAGO, Oct. S.-Chlcatro's great
auditorium never held a greater gather-
Ins: than to-night, when the Chicago day
banquet was held within its walls under
the auspices of the fall festival commit
tee. The great stage, upon which 1000
people can easily find standing room, had
bee.-i enlarged and a floor built over the
seats of the parquet,, quadrupling the
floor space of the stage.
Back of the raised table at the west of
the hall, at which President McKlnley
and the guests of honor were seated, was
an elaborate peace arch twenty feet In
height, constructed of pastry. It was
decorated with flags, tastefully draped
from the folds of which twinkled hun
dreds of little electric lights. On both
sides of the arch were great shields with
paintings of the American eagle and
groupings of American, British and Mex
ican flags. The balconies were resplen

dent with banners and the coats of arms I
of all States in the Union. These were j
placed at regular Intervals around the
balcony below the first row of boxes and i
around each shield which bore the arms j
of a State was grouped a cluster of small
silk banners. On every table was placed
an elaborate floral piece, representing 'i
famous battle scene in the history of the
republic, a scene from the history of Chi
cago and' other suitable events.
The President, who was the guest of
honor, sat at a raised table on the right j
of Melville E. Stone, the toastmaster.
Other distinguished guests were at the
same table, among them being Vice Presi
dent Don Ignacio Mariscal of Mexico,
Premier Wilfrid Laurier of Canada, Senor
Manuel de Azpiroz, Secretary Gage, At

Senator William B. Allison. Senator j
James M. McMillan. Senator Samuel D.
McEnery, Commissioner General Ferdi
nand W. Peck and General Chambers Mr-'
Ibben. The material part of the banquet
occupied two hours, and it was nearly 10
o'clock when Mr. Stone rapped for order |
and brought the Intellectual portion of the
programme to the front in a brief ad
dress. â¢
Governor Tanner then In a short ad
dress welcomed the visitors on behalf of
the State of Illinois. After he had con
cluded Mayor Carter H. Harrison of Chi
cago and Senator Shelby M. Cullom of
Illinois were Introduced in succession, the
former extending to the visitors the wel
come of the people of the city of Chi
cago, and the latter a greeting on behalf
of the Federal officials of Illinois.
The banquet guests knew by their pro
grammes who came next on the list of
speakers, and when the toastmaster rose
to Introduce the President, who responded j
to the sentiment of "The Nation," he was
greeted with cheers which for a time pre
vented his voice being heard. When quiet
had been restored Mr. Stone Introduced
President McKlnley, who spoke as fol- ;
lows:

Following the address of the President,
which was received with every manifesta
tion of enthusiastic approval, Mr. Stone
introduced Sir Wilfrid Laurier of Canada,
who, he announced, was to speak on "The
Dominion. "
The Canadian Premier expressed his
deep appreciation of this sympathetic re
ception, uttered his belief that the
Canadian people would at all times re
ciprocate the kindly feelings manifested
by those presentâ reciprocate not only in
words evanescent but in actual living
de. .is, and said it was an evidence of the
good relations which ought to prevail be
tween two such countries as the United
States and Canada that the people of
Chicago had Invited Canadians to par
ticipate in their day of rejoicing. After a
flattering reference to the splendid energy
and courage of the city of Chicago, the
Canadian Premier said:
Whenever you -meet courage you are sure to
meet Justice and generosity. Courage, justice
and generosity always go together, and there
fore It is with some degree of satisfaction that
I approach the toast to which I have been
called to respond. Because I must say that I
feel that though relations between Canada and
the United States are good, though they are
brotherly, though they are steadfast. in my
judgment they are not as good, as brotherly,
as satisfactory as they oueiit to be. We are
if the same stock. We spring from the same
races on one side of the line as on the other.
We speak the same language. We have the
same literature, and for more than a thousand
years we have had a common history.
.May 1 not ."ay that while our relations are
not always as brotherly as they should have
been, may I net ask, Mr. President on the part
of Canada and on the part of. the United States,
are we not sometimes too prone to stand by the
full conceptions Of our rights and exact all
our rights to the last pound of flesh? May 1
not ask if there have not been too often be
tween us petty quarrels, which, happily, do
not wound the heart of the nation?
I am proud to say in the presence of the
chief executive of the United States that it is
the belief of the Canadian Government that we
should make a supreme effort to better our
relations, and make the Government of Presi
dent McKinley and the present Government of.
Canada, with the assent of Great Britain, so
to work together as to remove all causes of dis
cussion between us. And regarding the com
mission which sat first in the old city of Que
bec and sat next in the city of Washington,
but whether sitting in Quebec or sitting in
Washington, 1 am sorry to say the result has
not been commensurate with our expectations.
Shall I speak my mind? (Cries of "Yes,
yes.") We met a stumbling block In the ques
tion of the Alaska frontier. Well, let me say
here and now that the commission could not
settle that question and referred to their par
t.cular Governments and they are now dealing
with It, May I be permitted to say here and
now that we do not desire one Inch of your
land (applause), hut if I state, however, that
we want to hold our land, though that would
not be an American sentiment, though it would
not.be a British or Canadian sentiment. I am
here to say above all, my fellow countrymen,
that we want not to stand upon the extreme
limits of our rights. We are ready to give
and to take. We can afford to be just; we can
afford to be generous because we are strong.
We have a population of 77,000,000â1 beg, par
don, I am mistaken, it Is the reverse of that.
(Laughter.) But pardon my mistake. Al
though it is the reverse, I am sure the senti
ment is the same. But though we have many
little bickerings of that kind, 1 speak my whole
mind and 1 believe I speak the mind of all
gentlemen when l say that hereafter when we
go down to he bottom of our hearts we will
find that there is between us true genuine
affection. (Applause.) There are no two na
tions to-day on the face of the globe so united
as Great Britain and the United Stated of
America. (Cheers.)
The Secretary of State told us some few
months ago that there was no treaty of alli
ance between Great Britain and the United
States of America. It is very true there is
between the United States of America and
Great Britain to-day no treaty which the pen
can write and which tie- en can make, but
there Is between Great Britain and the United
States of America a unity of blood, which Is
thicker than water. (Applause.) And I ap
peal to recent history when 1 say that when
ever one nation has to face emergencyâ a
greater emergency than forthwith the
ships of other nations go to their sister. (Ap
plause.) When last year you were suddenly
engaged In war with Spain, though Spain was
the weaker party and though, it is natural that
men should side with the weaker party, our
sympathies went to you for no other reason
than that of blood (applause), and I am sure
you will agree with me that though our re
lations have not reached the degree of per
fection to which I would aspire, from that
day a new page has been turned in the his
tory of our country. It was no unusual oc
currence before the mi nth of May, 1898, to
read In the British press of American arro
gance: neither was it an unusual occurrence to
read in, the American press of British brutality.
Since the month of May, 1898, these expressions
have disappeared from the vocabulary.
Sir. an incident took place in the month of
June last which showed to me at all events
conclusively that there is between us a very
dee] and sincere affection. I may be pardoned.
if I recall that Instance because I have to
speak of myself. In the month of .tune last I
spoke on the floor of the House of Commons of
Canada on the question of Alaska, and I
enunciated the very obvious truism that Inter
national problems can be settled In one or two
ways only, either by arbitration or by war.
And although I proceeded to say that a war
between Great Britain and the United ' States
would be criminal and would not be thought of
for the moment, still the word "war" created
quite an excitement in this country. For that
causeless excitement, though I was indirectly
the cause of It, I <!>> not at this moment find
any fault, because it convinced me to an abso
lute certainty that between your country and
my country the relations have reached that de
gree of dignity and respect, and affection that
even *'â¢â  word "war" is never to-be men
tioned In a British assembly or In an American
assembly. (Applause.) I repeat what I then
stated, that war between Great Britain and
the United States would be criminal in my
estimation and judgment, just as criminal as
the civil war which desolated your country
some thirty years ago.
The. welcome extended to Sir Wilfrid
Laurier was repeated when the next
speaker. Vice President Mariscal of
Mexico, rose. Ho responded to the toast
"The Republic of Mexico."
Secretary Long, who responded to "The
Navy," received a greeting that will live
with him for many days. "The Glories
of the. G. A. R." were dwelt upon by
Colonel D. B. Henderson of Dubuque,
lowa, the next Speaker of the national
House of Representatives. The last ad
dress on the regular programme was by
General Thomas M. Anderson. U. S. A.,
commander of the Department of the
Lakes, who responded to the toast "The
Army."

Sutter Club, caused a sensation among
his friends here, and he would be over
whelmed with congratulations if these
friends could only get him within range.
But Mr. Roble chose to elude his well
wishers and he carried out his plan ad
mirably.
He departed the other day by an after
noon train for Oakland with Miss Marie
Dixon, and the wedding ceremony was
performed in that city very quietly that
evening. All this was brought about with
out the knowledge of Mr. Roble's hosts
of friends Jn local bachelordom.
The bride is a cousin of Mrs. Charles K.
Lipman of this city and a sister of John
L. Dixon, a wharfinger of San Francisco,
whose marriage to a niece of ex-Governor
Budd was chronicled in the newspapers
a few months ago. Mr. Robie has been
for several years the local manager of
the Capital Box Factory.

Defense in the Mills Case.
REDWOOD CITY, Oct. 9.â The testi
mony introduced by the defense In the
Mills contest to-day tended to show that
Mills never made public acknowledgement
that the plaintiffs were his children. A
number of prominent residents were ex
amined to this purpose. Among the depo
sitions read from the absent heirs were
letters written by Mrs. Mills after the
death of her husband, in which she stated
that the Chathams were making trouble
for the estate, and if they succeeded in
their claims the absentees would get noth
ing. She had no fears as to the ultimate
outcome.

EFFECT OF A RECENT ORDER
BY THE PRESIDENT.
* ; ' ,
His Edict Stopping the Sale of Pub
lic Lands and Declaring Void
:;;:,-. Past Transfers Is Com
bated. '
BY HORACE WRIGHT.
HONOLULU, Oct. 2.â President Dole and
his Cabinet are beginning to understand
that Hawaii is annexed and that there
is a high, authority over the people of
Hawaii tWan the-' men who - . dethroned the
monarchy. On the morning after the of
ficial proclamation of the executive order
of President Kinley relating to the sale
of public lands 1 called upon President
Dole to obtain from him an expression of
his views. He evidently felt that he had
been rebuked upon Insufficient grounds,
and he refused to be interviewed, saying
merely: "We are but subordinates to the
Government in Washington, and I do not
think it would be right or proper for me
to discuss the matter."
He then proceeded to a meeting of in
fluential citizens to arrange for Hawaii
being represented at the Paris Exposi
tion as a territorial part of the United
States, and this representation, so far as
Haw a is concerned, is now practically
arranged for, unless another executive
order intervenes.
Accompanying the President's order is a
long letter from Attorney General Griggs
to President McKinley, in which, alter
referring to the protest to the proposed
tale of the Olaa lands, be says:
"I have given attentive consideration to
the question raised by these papers, and
have no hesitation In advising you that
the officers of the existing Government in
said islands have no autnority to sell or
otherwise dispose of the public lands in
the Hawaiian Island.-, and that any such
sales, or agreement to sell, will be abso
lutely null and void as against the Gov
ernment of the Unit* States. It Is only
necessary to refer to the language of the
iNe.wlands) resolution and to the well un
derstood principles of public law. which
govern the subject cf territory ceded by
one Government to another to reach the
easy conclusion that the public lands In
the Hawaiian. Islands, upon the approval
of the ant resolution of cession, became
the property of the I'nited States, and
could thereafter be disposed of only in ac
cordance with such special laws as Con
gress might thereafter direct. The fact
that Congress has failed up to this time
to legislate on the subject has not rein
vested the Hawaiian Government with its
former power of disposition: That power
ceased upon the cession. Until Congress
passes laws in conformity to the provis
ions ..ft': resolution of annexation pro
viding for the sale or disposition of these
land! they must remain undisposed of."
It may be interesting to learn who art
affected under the provision "that if any
yales or agreements for sale of said pub
lic lands have been made since the adop
tion of the resolution of annexation, the
purchasers shall be notified that the same
are null and void, and any consideration
paid to. the local authorities on account
therefor shall be in led."
Official figures give the amount of money j
received since annexation at 157,3? 33, j
which amount, it Is said, has been applied 1
to the payment of Government bonds, and i
not directly for educational purposes, j
Nearly '**) persons and corporations are
interested in the decision, and some 10.423 >
acres of land have been disposed of since
annexation, and in addition a very large
number of small homesteads, of from ten
to thirty acres each, have also been taken ;
up. principally by Ha walla ns and Portu- '
guese. Un the islands of Hawaii and Maui.
The principal sufferers probably are the
he prlnci
Honolulu Sugar Company; who gave $10,
--000 for a lot upon which their mill and
buildings are erected, and C. Brewer & I
Co.. who have erected a handsome corn- i
mercial buildin.tr at eal cost. Costly Im
provements have also been placed "on a
very large number of the lots. Ami :
the other sugar plantations affected are
the Makee Nahiku. Pioneer. Olaa (coffee)
and others. The Catholic mission is also a
loser. 'i be Mak< â¢ Company has its costly
pumping plant upon its forty-four acres.
erected at an enormous cost. The Oahu
railroad suffers a little, but the Hilo and
Kohala railroads have practically their
rights of way taken from them and are
placed at a standstill.
It is now understood that unless the ex- !
ecuth â  order is modified the matter will
be taken before the Supreme Court of the
Unit- States by certain wealthy firms. 1
CHARGES OF DESERTION
MAY BE DROPPED
Recommendations Made in the Re
port of Judge Advocate Gen
eral of the Navy.
WASHINGTON. Oct. 9.-In his annual
report to the Secretary of the Navy Cap
tain Samuel C. Lemley, Judge Advocate
General, submits some Important recom
mendations looking to the betterment of
the Judicial branch of the naval service.
He calls attention to the great hardship
of carrying on the records charges of
desertions against veterans of the army'
and navy who left their organizations at
the close of the civil war without await
ing the formality of discbarge, and it is
recommended that Congress further ex
tend the beneficial provisions of the act
of August 14, IS>S, tended to relieve these
people.
Attention Is directed to the urgent ne
cessity of conferring upon courts-martial
the power to compel the testimony of civ
ilians. It is also urged that court-martial
proceedings may be simplified and has
tened to a conclusion if Congress confers
upon the courts the power to take testi
mony by deposition. Another recom
mendation is the merging of the examina
tion and retiring: boards, now uselessly
dupllcating functions.
The matter of prize and bounty claims
receives considerable attention, and the
Judgt* Advocate General submits a list
of cases where his office has certified to
the Treasury Department the facts con
nected with the seizure of Spanish ves
sels during the war. The vessels In such
cases are all of them merchant ships, and
the majority of them fell to the share of
the blockading Bquadron, many of them
being subjected to the claims of half a
dozen United States war vessels. Four
teen cases were carried to the Supreme
Court for adjudication.
Relative to the bounty claims, Including
those of the actions of Manila Bay and
Santiago, as well OS for the sinking of
the Reina Mercedes, the Judge. Advocate
General calls upon the Court of Claims to
take such action a. would settle them
promptly, and they are now pending be
fore the court. .

HERR SINGER MADE PRESI
DENT WITHOUT OPPOSITION.
Â« â 
About One-Fourth of the Population
of Germany Represented by
Delegates Who Are As
sembled.
Special Dis:>aich to The Call.
HANOVER, Oct. 9.â The tenth annual
Socialist conference since the repeal of
the socialist laws opened this morning In
â¢the Balthorf, which is tastefully decor
ated with laurel leaves, red banners and
the. escutcheons of various German cities.
In the center, grouped amid ferns and
flowers around an allegorical figure of
Liberty, are busts of Ferdinand de Salle.
the originator of th- Social Democratic
movement In Germany; Karl Marx, the
chief of international socialism, and En
gels. Places had been provided for the
Police Commissioners and police officers
who will attend the proceedings on be
half of the Government.
There are 2-10 delegates, Including repre
sentatives, of Holland, Sweden, Switzer
land .ad Austria, the Austrian delegation
Including Dr. Adler, the Austrian social
-Ist leader, who toward the end of this
month must enter upon a term of four |
weeks' imprisonment to which he was re
cently sentenced. The delegates sit at
tables ranged along the whole length of |
the hall, and the scene presents rather the
appearance of students at a symposium !
than an assembly of workingmen repre
senting at least one-fourth of the popula-
Uon of Germany.
Herr Singer was unanimously elected
president. After the formal proceedings
animated discussion arose over the ques
tion whether the committee had acted in ]
the Interests of socialism In excluding
from the "Quest of Martyrs," publishetl
In the Vorwaerts, the socialistic organ, j
the laborers condemned for taking part in j
the Dresden riots. . .
A Saxon delegate hotly denounced the \
action of the committee, and was. repeat
edly called to order. The question was
finally shelved by a decision that the j
matter had been adequately thrashed out.
The Dresden, Mecklenburg. Stuttgart
and Munich delegates then moved that an ]
interpolation be submitted to the Reich-
Stag regarding the police prohibition of j
the dissemination of pamphlets containing
electioneering arguments In streets and
public places, and also regarding the ac- !
tion of the postal authorities in prohibit- I
ing the distribution of socialist literature
on Sunday, because of which prohibition |
many socialists have been fined for pri- |
vately itributing their party's organ.
Herr Rebel contended that an lnterpo
lation was impossible In the absence cf â 
specific data, and the motion was re- j
jected. Herr Liebnecht then Introduced
a resolution exhorting socialists to take
a 5 active part as possible in the In- i
ternatlonal Socialist Congress to be held !
in Paris In 1900. The resolution was adopt- ;
ed and the conference adjourned.

Any Business.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 9.â The United
States Supreme Court convened to-day for
the regular October term, but adjourned j
without transacting any business, accord- i

with the court to-morrow. Among the I
cases which were assigned for argument j
next week, and which will be reassigned, j
are those relating to the validity of tax- j
ation in Tennessee, a South Dakota max- i

UNEXPECTED
DOWNFALL OF
RECREATION
Socialist Bested the Morcllo
Mare and Was Bid Up.
Five Choices Beaten.
One of the unlooke.d for occurrences at
Oakland track yesterday was the defeat
of the 9 to 20 favorite Recreation In the
seven-furlong run. The Burns & Water
house mare looked a likely winner into the
stretch, when she began to back up, and
Socialist, ridden by Ruiz, beat her rather
cleverly in I:2S. Uncomplimentary remarks
have been passed around about both the
â¢winner and Jockey Ruiz, and when led up
to be sold "Frisco" Linda horse received
a "boost." Entered for $300, he was bid
up to $700 by Jim Neil, his owner respond
ing with the customary $5 bid.
This and the defeat of four other favor
ites were the only unexpected happenings
of the afternoon. The weather was warm
and balmy and the track fast.
Charles Le Bel, the mount of Eddie
Jones, was backed as if it were all over
to win the opening six-furlong scramble:
hut Somis. a 5 to 1 shot, won without
asking. Le Bel was ridden out to beat
Ban Augustine for the place.
The unruly Slsquoc closed post favorite
for the two-year-old sprint, decided over
the Futurity course, but again demons
Ftrated that he is not a stayer. Chamnlon
Rose, played from 4 to 3. with Jones in
the saddle, was always in front, and. hard
ridden, led Palapa out half a length. E'.la
dv Poy, a 20 to 1 shot, finished in the
fhow. Slsquoc showed speed to the
stretch.
Backed to even money favoritism, Road
runner, with Thorpe in the saddle, made
no showing whatever In the mile selling
handicap. A half mile had not been cov
ered when he was hopelessly beaten. Best
ridden, McFarlane, an 8 to i shot, finished
gamely, downing the pacemaker. Wll
meter. a length. Petal, miserably ridden,
was third.
A wild plunge was made on Etta H to
capture the last number on the card, a
six-furlong selling affair, forcing the
mare's price down from fours to even
money in no time. She led to th' bend
for the wire, with Heigh Ho at her heels,
and then grew very leg-weary. The last

Track Notes.
A. carload of twelve horses belonging to
Barney Schrelber arrived at Oakland yes
terday. They were in charge of Dick
"Williams, and included such cracks as
Bannockburn, Fly-by-Nlght. Boundlee
and Miss Marion. Another carload, also
owned by the St. Louis bookmaker, is ex
pected In to-day.
Eight bookmakers cut in yesterday, and
there is play enough for half a dozen
more. Bill Langford cut in under the
name of the Olympic Club and quit a
healthy winner.
If Harry Whitman expects to make a
rider of Buchanan he should coach him
a bit as to pace. Taking a horse away
out of the running when the leaders are
only crawling along may not always be
considered a mistake.
"Quill" Morse is still In full enjoyment
of his long run of hard hick. He has been
seen up In the saddle over twenty times
on both good nd bad horses, but as yet
his name is bracketless.
Rapldo pulled up bleeding slightly at

LIGHTWEIGHTS WILL BATTLE
FOR COAST CHAMPIONSHIP
Two Clever Boxers to Meet a Second Time Thursday Night.
INTEREST In the National Club's
bouts which are to be" presented in
Woodward's Pavilion on Thursday
night is on the increase. Theodore
Van Busklrk, who has won some fame
as a heavy-weight boxer, is to be
pitted against Fred Russell, a giant
who hails from St. Paul. That their
"go" will be an interesting one to
followers of the sport is beyond ques
tion. Van Buskirk has been training
hard at Marysville and expects to en
ter the ring at 195 pounds. Russell has
been fitting himself at the Six-mile
House and will weigh in the neighbor
hood of 200 pounds.
As much Interest and even more Is
being taken in the fifteen-round con
test between Rufe Turner, the colored
champion lightweight of the coast,

having succumbed to his dusky .op
ponent at Stockton some months ago.
Reiily claims, as do also his friends,
that he was not in condition when he
fought Turner, having suffered from a
fever contracted in Portland. To prove
this assertion, the friends of the hard
hitting local lad are banking heavily
on his chances of victory. . They feel
certain that Reiily will win out before
the bout goes to the limit.
Roth Reiily and Turner are training

AMERICANS BATTED POORLY.
Made a Miserable Showing in Cricket
Game With English Team.
PHILADELPHIA. Oct. 9.â The match
between the English cricketers and the
gentlemen of Philadelphia was continued
to-day on the Germantown Cricket Club's
grounds at Manheims and was notable
for the poor batting of the Americans.
The ball played slowly owing to a wicket
softened by rain. Prince Ranjitsinhjl was
unable to play owing; to a sore throat.
When stumps were drawn for the day the
Englishmen were all out for 263 runs and
the Americans had all been retired in
their first Inning for 85. They began the
second inning and made a total of 46 runs
for two wickets.
Prince Ranjitsinh.il's team will leave
here to-morrow night for Toronto, Can
ada, where they will play a two-days'
match against all Canada, returning to
New York on Friday.
pride to the fact that although he was
not in condition when he met Turner
In Stockton he landed often and hard
enough to make his rival remember
that no "dub" was before him.
Turner, who is a brother of clever
Charley, is aware of the fact that in
Reiily he has a hard customer. He is
therefore paying close attention to his
work and expects to enter the roped
arena In fine fettle. His numerous
admirers in Stockton and vicinity,
where, he has fought his way into
prominence, are coming to the fight in
largo numbers and with money to
back their favorite. The sale of seats
promises to be a large one, as lovers
of the manly sport have not had an
opportunity in some time to see a good
man perform.

WONDERFUL MARCONI.
BENJAMIN FRANKLIN died one hundred and
nine years ago. Frictional electricity was known
before his day, but he was the first to identify
it as an element common with the lightning. Lightning
and thunder were great natural wonders that early at
tracted the attention and the awe of self-conscious
man. Two thousand nine hundred and seventeen
years ago David in his psalm of thanksgiving for de
livery from his enemies and from the hands of Saul
said, "And He sent arrows and scattered them;
lightning and discomfited them." The Book of Job
presents that anthropomorphic view of Deity which
was adopted by Milton in "Paradise Lost" and by
Everest Parity in his "Guerre Celeste." In address
ing Job he is asked, "Canst thou send lightnings that
they may go, and say unto thee, 'Here we are'? "
In 1752 Franklin drew upon himself the charge of
irreverence when he sent his kite up to a thunder
cloud and took upon his knuckle the spark of elec
tricity brought down on the string. In the one nun
'dred and forty-seven years gone since that day the
world has been continually awakened to the impor
tance of his discovery, which was the greatest scien
tific fact discovered in the eighteenth century. It
proved the existence of a pervading influence in the
universe as general as ether and air, as tenuous as
cither, and yet the storehouse of a power nothing
can resist. In that spark that struck the philosopher's
knuckle was the seed of the telegraph, telephone, the
cables under the seas, the cars moved rapidly on land,
of the lights that brighten a myriad of cities, the heat
that reduces food for human use, the cylinder that
records the human voice and the process that pictures
things in action and reproduces them upon a screen.
But the most wonderful of all the marvels captured
from that thundercloud has been left to crown the
nineteenth century as the wonder of all the ages in
Marconi's wireless telegraphy. It has demonstrated
that as the discharges of electricity between cloud and
earth, between the positive and the negative, need no
directing medium, no wire, no kite string, so the use
of electricity as a medium for conveying language and
transferring thought requires no wire. There is in
the air itself, with the same tenuity as electricity, the
capacity to transmit the controlled current, with the
same facility for opening and closing the circuit and
articulating the words and signs of a message as has
been supposed possible only by the use of a wire.
The great international yacht race off Sandy Hook
at New York has transferred Marconi's discovery
from the stage of interesting laboratory experiment
to the field of assured practicality. Indeed, this had
been done when The Call received by wireless teleg
raphy the news across the water that the Sherman
was sighted bearing the returning California Volun
teers. But that demonstration did not have the bene
fit of the world's attention, though it was the means
of securing the inventor to use the yacht race as an
international occasion for conquesting the world's ad
mission of the practical character of his discovery.
Standing on the deck of a steamer in close company
with the racing boats, much of the time fifteen or more
miles from shore, he noted every tack, position,
change in speed and incident on every boat's length
of the course and transmitted it all through the air to
shore, whence it came by special wire. three thousand
five hundred miles to The Call office, where it was
bulletined within an average of two minutes from the
time he committed it to the air! Other reporters of
the event had to watch the yachts from the shore,
whence a correct observation of their position and
their work is impossible. If reporters were as near by
as he, with the same facilities for observation, the
transmission of what they saw was impossible. But
this wizard, this new prince of the powers of the
air, flung his message into space, and if the cable
service were organized for transmission it could have
been in London and all the capitals of Europe and on
the far side of the planet as promptly as it came one
seventh of the world's circumference to San Francisco.
The mind is conscious of the effort heeded to grasp
this wonder just as the minds of men, were conscious
of exertion and change in methods of thought and
reasoning to take full hold upon what Franklin
demonstrated, and its first withdrawal from laboratory
seclusion, nearly a hundred years later, in Morse's in
vention of the telegraph.
The civilized mind, however, does not work is
slowly as it did fifty and a hundred years ago. The
march of invention and the economic application of
science have brightened and sharpened the intellect,
yet Marconi has taxed the trained intelligence of the
world as none of his predecessors have done. The
application of his discovery has as yet no bounds
fixed. This survey must come by experiment and
practice.- But it is within the range of possibility that
soon wireless telegraphy will be a necessity in the
equipment of every sea-going steamer, and that
progress of voyage, health of passengers, storm and
prospective wreck far out, at sea will be a common
feature in the news of every day.
The Call is gratified to have had a part In the
wonderful work of demonstrating Marconi's discovery,
which easily subordinates all that had preceded it, and
appears destined to stand alone, supreme, isolated, in
its awe-inspiring influence for an age to come.
He has answered affirmatively the challenge to
Job. He has sent the lightnings that they may go,
and say unto him, "Here we are."
MUNICIPAL POLITICS.
THE beginning of the municipal campaign has
already, witnessed the invention and imposition
of a false issue.
When Hon. Horace Davis was nominated for
Mayor by the Republican party last Thursday night
he accepted in a temperate speech, in which he said:
"The position of Mayor of San Francisco is at all
times one of responsibility, but this year it is more
responsible than ever. We have come to the parting
of the ways, where the city shall cast off its swaddling
clothes and come out into the grace and majesty of
civic maturity. Your platform sets forth the prin
ciples upon which you ask and have a right to expect
the support of the people. I accept the responsibil
ity imposed upon the nominee for Mayor by that plat
form. lam in favor of and have had some experience
in the work of municipal reform. I had the honor to
preside over a preliminary convention looking to the
framing of the new charter, and I participated in sev
eral ratification meetings, believing that the charter
opened to us a new era for municipal reform. I shall
endeavor, if elected, to carry out its provisions faith
fully and honestly.
"We are not only municipal reformers, but we are
Republicans. We are not bound to do our duty only
in our city and our State, but we are bound to defend
our greater home that stretches across the continent
and is washed by two great oceansâ our country.
This is not merely a local fight; it is the advance
skirmish of the great battle that will be fought over
the whole country a year from now. When we come
out of this fight, with victory upon our banner, we
shall be ready to bear our part, and a strenuous one,
' in the national fight.
"I ask you to go home and organize and consoli
date your strength in every district and locality 'and
be ready for the fray. Remember that you are not
fighting for your city alone, nor for your State alone,
but you are fighting for your country."
Twenty-four hours later Hon. James D. Phelan ap
peared before the Democratic municipal convention
to accept its nomination for Mayor, and said:
"I noticed that last night the candidate of the Re
publican party asserted that national issues must be
considered in this campaign. He appealed to his con
vention to come together and arm and fortify them
selvesfor what? For the election next year. Gen
tlemen, we are not conducting the election next year
at this time. We are conducting the election this
year, and we have told the people through our plat
form what we propose to do. (Applause.)
"With all respect to the intellect and experience
! and the public service of Mr. Horace Davis, I say that
he is it is a hard word to use, but I will say it) a
; traitor to the new government of San Francisco; that
he is false to the charter when he utters such a state
ment. He is false to the charter when he endeavors
to influence the minds of the people by incorporating
| national issues into a municipal campaign, when that
! instrument and the very spirit and letter of that in
j strument is designed to remove national considera
j tions from municipal affairs.
"* *; * During the last three years we have built
up an organization to serve the city and county of
San Francisco in its municipal affairs. And now we
ask for an expression of confidence. When a party
has rendered distinguished public services, as the
Democratic organization has done, and will to a
greater extent do, then we can go before the people
and say that all our purposes are to serve all. to give
better government, and if we have been faithful in
small things may we not in the State and national
sense be faithful also in great thing-"
It will be seen that Mr. Davis and Mr. Phelan in
their statement of the State and national aspect of the
campaign were in substantial accord. Mr. Phelan did
not omit to state the prestige which a municipal vic
tory will give his party in the State and national
campaign to come. Mr. Davis reminded Republicans
of their duty to their city, their State and their
country.
After thinking it over Mr. Phelan found himself a
loser in the personal attack on Mr. Davis, and from
forty-eight hours' reflection addressed that gentle
man a. letter in which he says: "I used a word, the
first that came to my lips, which I at once regretted,
and, while expressive of my idea, it was too harsh a
term to apply to a gentleman who has always been
courteous to me and whose character I have always
respected." But when he used the term it was not
impulsive but deliberate. He not only debated it in
his mind, but he uttered the result of deliberation
when he said, "It is a hard word to use, but I will
use it."
In his letter of apology, which does not apologize,
he repeats the offense, if anything, in exaggerated
form. Referring to Mr. Davis' call to duty in all
governmental affairs he says: ''If your contention
be true, the charter has erred; but we know that bad
municipal government in San Francisco has come
largely from the fact that unfit men have floated into
oifice under party pressure or under the shadow of
greater and more exciting issues 'than local interests
can present." This sentence of his letter is inverted,
and what begins should have ended it, as follows:
"Therefore separate municipal elections at consider
able cost have been ordered."
What fair-minded men or unfair-minded men ca
pable of understanding very plain English can ex
tract from the speech of Mr. Davis the conclusion
that he opposes separate municipal elections? Yet,
Mr. Phelan accuses him of doing just that, and this
accusation occurs in an apology for calling his op
ponent "a traitor," which he admits expresses his
idea!
Mr. Phelan has sacrificed any reputation he may
have had for that sincerity and forthrightness which
â¢become a gentleman to his political ambition. He
used the word "traitor" to please the violent aggre
gation which he was addressing, and, withdrawing
that, substitutes a false charge for a harsh word and
goes deliberately on. record under circumstances that
render the plea of impulsiveness impossible. As a
man's career in public affairs progresses he uncon
sciously unfolds himself as he is, not as he wishes
others to think he is. It is evident that Mr. Phelan
has reached the unfolding stage. He began with a
harsh and unjustifiable word and ascription and
covers that revelation of himself with a still worse
offense. It is well that personalities are his monopoly,
for his use of them holds up to nature that mirror in
which he is seen as he is, stripped of the shelter of
deportment and profession. â¢
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS.
Iâ _;OR some cause not apparent at this distance, the
I Republicans of Nebraska saw fit to embody in
Republicans of Nebraska saw fit to embody in
their State platform a plank declaring: "We
commend to the thoughtful consideration of the Re
publican party of the nation the proposition that a
national convention be called by two-thirds of the
States to revise the constitution of the United States,
under provisions of article V of the Federal constitu
tion." ''A'
The plank of course cuts no figure in the State
campaign, for it does not constitute a live issue. It
is, however, interesting as an evidence of the wide
spread desire for amending the* constitution. It is
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 10, 1899.
fairly certain that a good many amendments will be
proposed at the coming session of Congress. These
will include changes providing for the election of
United States Senators by direct vote of the people,
the lengthening of the term of Representatives from
two to four years, the lengthening of the Presidential
term to six years with a provision that the incum
bent of the office shall not be eligible for re-election,
and one changing the date of inauguration. There is
another which has been suggested by a member of the
House from Kansas, by which the sessions of Con
gress shall be held alternately in the West and in the
East
Of all these propositions the only one which t has
much chance for passage in either House is that regu
lating the election of United States Senators. The
others are hardly more than matters for academic de
bate. In any event the Republican party of the na
tion is not likely to approve the plan recommended by
| Nebraska. A convention called to revise the Fed
! eral constitution would be about the worst political
j calamity that could befall the country. The organic
law under which the republic has lived for more than
I a century has its defects, but the present generation
of statesmen is hardly fitted to be trusted with the
work of making a better one.
THE LESSON OF THE FIRES.
rIRE in the Sutro forest, sweeping over the hills
and threatening the buildings of the Affiliated
Colleges and many dwellings and shops, brings
home to the people of San Francisco the dread
danger that impends over all the wooded districts of
California during the dry and heated season. It re
calls once more the heavy losses annually inflicted
upon the State by such fires, and impresses upon the
popular mind the importance of devising and putting
into effect some comprehensive plan for the protec
tion of the forests and the manifold interests that de
pend upon them.
Bad as the fire was in the Sutro woods, it was but
a trifle in comparison to the fires raging in the for
ests elsewhere. In the Santa Cruz Mountains a fire
which had been smoldering for some days broke out
fiercely in the hot winds of Sunday and destroyed
not only a large quantity of valuable timber, but
vineyards and barns and dwellings. Even worse re
ports come from other districts. Dispatches from
Keswick announce that for four days forest fires have
been running over the Clear Creek region west of
Shasta, while other reports tell of destructive flames
raging from Covelo to Laytonville, and from Cahto
to Westport, sweeping everything inflammable in
their path.
The worst of such fires is that the damage
does not end with the immediate property loss. The
destruction of the timber on every considerable area
of land tends to change the natural order of the
watercourses from steady streams running all the year
round to spring torrents that rush to the seas, leaving
their courses dry during the season when the water
is most needed. Jn that way every industry is in
jured and the soil itself threatened with barrenness.
In hardly any civilized portion of the world has the
lesson of the need of forest protection been more
strikingly taught than in California. It has been costly
enough to make it impressive to even the most indif
ferent. The annual losses done to farms, pastures,
vineyards, orchards and buildings of one kind or
another amount to far more than the sum that would
be required to establish an efficient forest police and
protection. It is a wasteful folly to hesitate longer in
undertaking such a policy, and it is to be hoped the
public mind will become so thoroughly educated on
the subject that when the next Legislature meets a
comprehensive scheme of forest protection will be
provided for by appropriate laws.
OHIO is at present the storm center of politics.
The contest there has overshadowed not only
Mr. Bryan's little fight in Nebraska but the
uproarious battle among the Bourbons in Kentucky,
which opened with such vigor that orators fainted on
the stump and rival speakers had to be put under
bonds to keep the peace before they, were permitted
to debate with one another.
As the Ohio campaign goes on it becomes more
evident that McLean builds his hopes for success
upon the factional fights in the Republican ranks.
and particularly upon that which rages in Cleveland
and Cuyahoga County. It is true that the talk of the
orators on the stump deals with questions of trusts,
imperialism and bossism, but there is no definite is
sue between the parties on either of those questions.
Republicans and Democrats alike denounce the bosses
and the trusts, while the issue of imperialism has not
been advocated by Republicans any more than by
some of the more noted Democratic leaders, and it is
not likely the vote of the State will be materially in
fluenced by it. Reports from all sources agree that
the main feature of the campaign is the dissension in
the Republican party, and that if the party be de
feated the result will be due more to personal antag
onisms than to anything else.
So hitter are the fights in Cuyahoga County that it
is said Colonel Dick, chairman of the State Republi
can Executive Committee, is afraid to visit Cleveland
.'est he should have to align himself with one party or
the other, and he has good reasons for desiring to be
free from such entanglements. There are 500,000 peo
ple in the county, and if it should go strongly one way
or the other it would undoubtedly carry the State with
it. In fact, the vote elsewhere is regarded as being
so equally divided that, according to the correspon
dent of the Philadelphia Record, even if it should
go for Jones, the independent candidate, he would be
elected.
Along with the hopes excited by dissensions among
Republicans McLean has other grounds' for expect
ing success. The correspondent of the New York
Tribune, in the course of a thorough review of the
situation, says:
"McLean counts earnestly on Republican divisions.
He counts with confidence, too, on a large floating
element which always desires change and under or
dinary conditions votes with the 'outs.' Favoring
political considerations, it is true, have enabled the
Republicans to hold this vote in recent years, but
those conditions no longer exist. McLean believes
that the enthusiasm proceeding from rising confi
dence in success after being so long out of power will
finally unite all the Democratic factions in his sup
port. Aside from these promising elements, McLean's
chief dependence is upon himself and a well-organ
ized, effective campaign. His barrel will be on tap
from start to finish. It is to be a still hunt."
It is to be noted, however, that in the State there is
also a very lively fight among the Democrats. There is
a faction among them known as the "Goats," and an
other faction called the "Kids." The two are most bit
ter in Cleveland. It is to McLean's advantage that both
are bidding for his support, and if he can continue to
keep them in a. condition of expectancy until after
election he may win out. In the general confusion of
things, however, the independent Mr. Jones has be
come an important factor in the contest. It is even
possible that in their disgust with the factions of the
old parties the Ohio voters may elect him just for
luck.

The wireless telegraph service the San

ls simply marvelous. The Call and New
York Herald have had a service from th**
race course on the water near Sandy
Hook of wireless telegraphy to the near

ceived bulletins every' two or three min

Marconi Deserves the Reward.
Oakland Tribune
The Individual who has come to the
front and disputes Marconi's rights to
the new wireless telegraphy does not
help his case much by saying that the
secret was in his possession when Mar
coni was a lad but 9 years old. If he
did not have enough enterprise about
him to develop the idea and make It
useful to the world he deserves to be
shut out now. Marconi is the man who
is giving civilization the benefit of It,
and he is entitled to the rewards that
accrue from his work.

The Board of Supervisors took care of
the half-starved inmates of the City and
County Hospital and Posthousc yester
day, and from now until the end of the
year the half-thousand stricken ones In
those Institutions will have the food and
drugs they need to make their lot as
mildly miserable as it may be. It took
some hard iigurlng to find enough money
with which to do it, and the plan
adopted resulted in the resignation of
Supervisor Perrault as chairman of the
Finance Committee, but the board cut !
out ali political and other considerations j
and faced the cold fact that the county's
wards were' starving and provided the i
wherewithal to keep them from It.
Chairman Perrault offered a resolution
which limited the hospital authorities to
a monthly expenditure of $s^-3. He did
not deny tho needs of tho county's sick
1., any means, but insisted that they
n.ust be provided for at an expense of not
more than 'that amount, as that was all
there was left. Supervisor Attrtdge,
chairman of the Hospital Committee, of
fered a second resolution allowing the
hospital its full $7500 per month and
charging any deficiency that might result
against statutory salaries connected with
the institution, to be carried over Into
the next half of the current fiscal year.
w hen It could be paid.
The contractors who were present de
clared they would not furnish another
dollar's worth of supplies if Perrault's
resolution were adopted, but would ac
cept the measure offered by Attridge.
The board adopted Attrldge' a resolution
forthwith, and Perrault promptly re
signed. His resignation was not accepted,
but on motion of Deasey was laid over a
week. Attridge's resolution read as fol
lows:
Resolved, That the Hospital Committee. Su
perintendent Physician of hospital and the hon
orable Board of Health be and are hereby re
spectfully requested to strictly scrutinize all
expenditures for the City and County Hospital
end to indorse no requisitions for supplies of
any kind, character or description unless the
same are urgently required for the care and
treatment of patients, and to conduct the said
Institution so that the necessary attention may
le afforded the unfortunate sick.
Resolved. That this board will allow and
crier paid all demands to the extent of $7300
and no more for each of the months of Septem
ber. October. November and December. ISS9,
for the expenditure of the City and County Hos
pital.
Resolved, That this board will provide the
means from the appropriation for urgent nec-s
--sity purposes, if the same should create a defi
ciency, and the amount expended will be at the
expense of statutory officers' salaries, which
salaries must be paid out of the, tunds of the
succeeding year.
Resolved. That all the bills for goods, wares
and supplies furnished under contracts entered
Into by this board will be allowed and ordered
paid and the Finance Committee is hereby
empowered and required to approve all of said
demands, the contractors furnishing supplies
agreeing to continue and comply with their
contracts under such conditions.
Supervisor Holland followed the load of
Attrfdge by introducing and righting
through to passage two much needed re
forms that have bobbed up and been
knocked in the head every year since
their necessity became apparent. He suc
ceeded in winning for the Police Depart
ment the right to appoint its own patrol

them, ard he also succeeded in having
adopted a resolution prohibiting the
stringing of unsightly campaign and
other banners across the prominent

AMBITION OF TWO BOYS TO
HOLD UP SOLDIERS CRUSHED
TWO boys, Willie L. Nicklet, 13
years of age, and Frank Walsh,
two years older, started out Satur
day nisrht on a career of daring
crime, after supplying themselves
with money stolen from Nicklet's
mother to furnish themselves with
the necessary material to carry out
their bold designs. They are now in
thÂ» City Prison booked for a public In
stitution and are bemoaning their fate.
Saturday night while Mrs. Nicklet
was asleep her young hopeful stol
from her dress a purse which contained
$24.25. They live a; 2321 Bryant ave
nue Walsh's people live in the neigh
borhood and when Nicklet stole out of
the house with the purse he was met
by Walsh and they conspired to have
some fun, as they express it. in hold
ing up soldiers at the Presidio after
they had been paid off by the Govern
ment. They slept under the stairs
hading up to Corbett's butcher shop.
Twmity-thlrd and Bryant streets, and
early yesterday morning, after dividing
the money in the purse, went down
and purchased a revolver and two
boxes of cartridges in a hardware store
on Fourth street. Their next purchase
was a pair of overalls each and a pair
would act as drivers, but who would be
directly accountable to the department.
To back up his resolution, he called in
Captain of Police Wittman; who said that
under the present arrangement neither
the department nor any one else had au
thority over the patrol drivers, and that
as a result they were constantly turning
up drunk, or refusing to do as they were
to.ii, or using vulgar language, or some
other of a dozen things for which a po
liceman would lose his star. Captain
Wittman not only made his charges, but
mentioned specific cases to prove them,
and when the matter came to a vote the
resolution was promptly passed. A sec
ond resolution, to take effect November
1, discharged every driver r.i>w In the ser
vice, leaving the field clear for the de
partment appointees.
A big delegation of business men and
taxpayers from the Mission came in to
request a place in the bond election. They
want a two-block park made of that dis
trict bounded by Dolores, Twenty-first,
Twenty-second and Churcn streets, and
want the money raised In the same way
that panhandle funds are to be realized.
They brought a resolution, placing their
project with the panhandle scheme, as a
matter to be settled and provided for in
the bond election, and there being no
word In opposition when Supervisor
Lackmann moved that their request be
granted, the Mission Park was included
in the issue. It is figured that the land in
volved will not cost over $300,000, and an
appraisement will be ordered next week.
Baterr.an Eras, were granted another
week in which to complete the Hall of
Justice, and upon motion of Lackmann the
position of Inspector of City and County
Supplies was created, the salary to be $1-5 j
per month. . '-..- - - â

that he had done away with 23S more

with long blades and a nickel-plated
watch and chain. They were afraid to
go into a restaurant so they bought
a large supply of peanuts to keep them
from starving. Willie also bought a
necktie.

CAMPAIGN IS
OPENING ON
PARTY LINES
Phelan's Utterances
on the Question.
â â¢ â _
METROPOLITAN HALL SPEECH
m
RECORD PRESERVED EOR SPE
CIAL USE AT THIS TIME.
: â¢
On August 4 of This Year the
Mayor Was a Red-Hot
Democratic Parti
san.
The Democrats are alarmed at the sug- j
gestion that party lilies should be drawn
in this municipal campaign. A subsidized
evening journal ls making a ridiculous
show of Itself In demanding that Repub
licans should support Mayor Phelan. The
Mayor himself is so Indignant that he de
nounces Horace Davis as a traitor to the
charter for encouraging Republicans to
maintain party lines in this contest.
Voters of San Franciscoâ Republicans
as well as Democratsâ remember that
there was a big mass-meeting at Metro
politan Hall on the evening of August 4â
four days prior to the primary election-
Mayor Phelan' Was advertised to speak
and The Call fancied that it would be a :
good plan to have an accomplished sten
ographer take down word for word every
thing that the voluble young statesman
might utter on that occasion. A record I
ls something that ought to be kept. and
a newspaper office is a good place to keep
It. Having kept the record. The Call is
In position to show positively that Mayor
Phelan is the man who established party
lines In this municipal campaign, and his
evening paper may apologize for him as
it gets ready, if he does not anticipate
the amend and apologize for himself. In
the course of his speech at Metropolitan
Hall Mayor Phelan said:
"The Democrats have set the pace In
this town to build it up and make it what
it should be. They have given the policy
to the city. We went to Sacramento, you
remember, in order to get party control."
Â» â¢ Â« Â» * Â» *
"Whatever may have been the faults of
the Committee of One Hundred, I have a
very great affection for it, because, while
it did not represent all the districts of the
city it was composed of men who tried to
do right and whose acts were in part in
dorsed by the people of this city; and
they gave us that policy and that plat
form. But now there Is no way of going,
even If we desired to do so, to the htate
Central Committee or to the Sacramento
convention and asking for authority to
sneak in the name of the Democratic
party. We have to go to the polls, and
we have to get control of the conven
tion.
"We have to get control of the con
vention, I say â control is a very
harsh word â in the interest of good .
government and decency; not that *
any man should have control to con
fer favors on his friends, but control
in order that that policy may be per
petuated and the Democratic party
made the instrument and the agency
of good government in San Fran
cisco.
â¢ â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢*
"Now. that ballot law adopted by
the last Legislature magnifies enor
mously the. importance of party con- ]
ventions. We all have to be party
men now. We have to carry out re- j
forms within the party. We all have
to be party politicians; we can't be
independent and go before the people
and say we will do thus and so. We
have to get behind the party and
make it the instrument and the
agency of our work."
The alarm In Democratic political circles
Is caused by a close analysis of the vote
by which Mayor Phelan defeated Charles
L. Patton for Mayor. Trie analysis shows
that if the regularly accredited Repub
lican precincts had given Mr. Patton the
party vote PI â¢ ail would have been de
feated. The present . signs point to the
conclusion that Horace Davis will get the
full Republican vote of every precinct in
San Francisco.
Since the last election Phelan has pub
licly proclaimed: "WE ALL HAVE TO
BE PARTY POLITICIANS: WE CAN'T
BE INDEPENDENT AND GO BEFORE
THE PEOPLE AND SAY WE WILL
DO TH("S AND SO. WE HAVE TO GET
BEHIND THE PARTY."
Horace Davis is .-lean, capable and true.
Under his leadership the Republican party
can be the instrument and agency of good
government in San Francisco.

Demo- committee, has not complet

KOSTER DECLINES.
Pressure of Business Affairs Causes
His Refusal.
John L. Koster, who was nominated for
Supervisor by the Republican convention,
sent a communication yesterday to Chair
man Kellogg In which he stated that on
account of the pressure of his private
business affairs it would be necessary tor
him to decline the nomination. While
In full sympathy, with the ticket as nom
inated and with the principles incorporat
ed in the platform as adopted, Mr. Kos
ter stated that it was with deep regret
that he was obliged to take the step.
In discussing the declination at his res
idence last night Mr. Koster said:
"I have declined the nomination with
which the Republican convention honored
me simply and solely because my private
business will not allow me to devote the
necessary time to the duties of the office
should I be elected to it. I have exten
sive ranching interests near San Jose and
at other points in the southern part of
the State and I am obliged to visit them
constantly, often finding it necessary to
spend weeks at a time in adjusting diffi
culties that continually arise.
"In fact, it was while I was away on
one of these trips that my name was
placed on the ticket. It was done with
out my knowledge and I am sorry that
circumstances are such that I must de
cline a nomination which I consider a
high honor and one not to be despised.
That is all there Is to my declination.
"I understand that rumors were cur
rent on the street yesterday that I had
declined because I was not in accord w...i
the principles of the Republican party or
some of its nominees. I wish to deny
this in emphatic terms. I am anxious
for the complete success of the Republi
can ticket as nominated and will work as
hard In its behalf as my limited time will
permit. Horace Davis I regard as the
highest type of manhood and believe he
has the confidence and respect of this
community. He is worthily entitled to
the suffrages of all good citizens and I
am sure he will make a Mayor of whom
we can all feel proud. I regard the tick
et as being first-class in every Individual
particular and shall certainly give it ray
undivided support."
An effort will be made to-day by a com
mittee to induce Mr. Koster to alter his
determination and it is expected that he
may yet do so. When asked last night
whether ho would comply with a request,
to withdraw his declination Mr. Koster
said:
"While I would appreciate such a re
quest as a great honor, still I must reit
erate my former statement, namely, that
I am unable to give the time which I
consider a public official should conscien
tiously devote to the proper fulfillment of
the duties for which he has been chosen.
If I had rhe time I would gladly make an
active canvass for the office."
HORACE DAVIS INDORSED.
South Park Improvement Club to
Carefully Scan Supervisorial
Candidates.
Only such candidates as have been nom
inated for the office of Supervisors as may
he found to go through the crucial test
of the members of the South Park
Improvement Club mi receive the
votes of that organization. At a
meeting held last night at 930 Howard
street, over which M. J. McÃride pre
sided, a motion was made by E. Barry
that a committee of five be appointed to
cull from the nominees such material as
may be suitable to the beat Interests of
the city and its taxpayers. This commit
tee consists of E. Barry, J. Barnes, S. H.
Williams, P. F. Benson and J. Kennedy,
with Chairman McÃride added.
Chairman McÃride spoke at consider
able length on th.- ability of Horace 'avis
for the office of Mayor, and added what
Mr. Davis had done for San Francisco
while in Congress regarding the exclusion
of the Chinese from the United Slates.
He said he was one of the vice presidents
at a meeting in Piatt's Hall over which
the late W. C. Coleman had presided, at
the time of the anti-Chinese agitation in
this city.
Filipinos to Return.
The sixty-eight Filipinos admitted here

been ordered deported by the next trans

of Immigration, Commissioner General
Powderly has ordered their immediate de
portation. He has requested General
Shatter to send them back by the first
transport that sails for the Philippines. ,

IMPERFECT DRAINS.
Care Should Be Taken That the Im-
purities Be Properly Carried Off.
Every one knows of the fatal results
I which follow the stoppage of the drains
j in a house.
Queen Victoria's husband, the Prince
Consort, died from poisonous germs.
; which were generated in the palace by
| the stoppage of the drains.
The kidneys, among their many
j other functions, act as drains to the
i body. Through them the blood passes
', to be purified, leaving behind a mass
j of effete matter, which it is their duty
j to eject from the system.
"When, however, the kidneys become
i congested and all clogged up, this ref-
i use matter accumulates and becomes
| an active poison, and in the course of
time infects ; the whole man, and event-
ually, if the cause is not removed, it
occasions sudden death, the patient
I drowning, as it were, in his own secre-
| tions.
The symptoms which nature puts
forth like danger signals to tell us that
the kidneys no longer do their duty are
; too numerous to set forth.
Nearly always women's peculiar ail-
ments in their more aggravated and
protracted forms are traceable to this
i source, and rheumatism, in all its va-
j ried phases; while pneumonia and
] Bright's disease are but the culmina-
! tion of an organic trouble, which, had
|it been treated organically and not
| symptomatically, could not possibly
j have had any such fatal termination.
Coughs and colds, strange as it may
i seem, are oftentimes symptoms of trou-
ble in the kidneys.
What must be done, then, in these
j cases?
It is surely unwj^e to treat symp-
-1 toms, when we can at once heal the
i organ from whence the symptoms rise.
Let us then at once go to the root
i of the trouble and heal the kidneys.
There is a remedy, known all the
j world over, that will strengthen them,
so that they can perform their func-
tions; feeding them and cleansing them
: in such a marvelous manner that the
patient immediately feels the good
: work that is going oh, and in a few
; weeks is able to join the ranks of the
many thousands who gratefully ac-
; knowledge that they owe health and
strength, and sometimes life itself, to

Is Now Flying to New York, Where
the Will of His Dead Father
Will Be Opened, and
Read.
Alfred Gwynne Vanderbllt, younger
Eon of *.he late Cornelius Vanderbllt,
stopped on his tour around the world by
the news of the death of his father, ar
rived In San Francisco harbor yesterday
afternoon on board the steamer City of
PÂ«klng. Almost before the quarantine
and customs officers had completed their
duties and before the vessel had reached
hÂ«Â»r dock the young heir to most of his
father's millions was whisked on to a
tug by waiting friends, carried across the
bay to the Oakland mole, conducted into
a palatial special car and guarded from
â¢intrusion until he was started eastward
at the end of the overland.
Scenes attending the arrival were beau
tiful to behold. The lever of the Vander
.bilt millions worked wonders. Quaran
i tine doctors got a special "move on;"
â¢customs inspectors skimmed over the
baggage of the youthful millionaire as
a swallow skims a roof on a rainy day;
Pacific Mall representatives kowtowed
: and hustled for the benefit of the young
Vanderbllt. The souls of all threedoc
itors, inspectors and steamship officials â
were consumed with one fear. They ex
pected any moment to Bee a battalion of
.'press representatives climb the rails of
the steamer, capture their valuable pas
| senger and hold him up for the story of
his trip. All their efforts were directed to
the forestalling of such an attempt and
.it succeeded. Young Vanderbllt got off
without ever saying as mucfi as "How
de-do" to a reporter.
The Peking was sighted about noon and
arrived in the harbor shortly after 1
o'clock. She was met off Alcatraz by the
quarantine officers and customs inspect
ors. A number of newspaper craft soon
gathered about the vessel, but the orders
were strict and even when the doctors
had given the ship a clear bill of health
the reporters were kept off -with the ex
cuse that the boarding officer had missed
connections. The Peking got up steam
again and about 8 o'clock was hove to
at the Mail dock.
The party that has been so anxiously '
awaiting the arrival of young Vanderbilt
â steamed up at this time on the tug Mil
ler Griffith. It consisted of Thomas Sa
'bine MeLane, who had come out from
â¢New York to meet the youthful million- j
aire; R. P. Schwerin, manager of the ;
â  Pacific Mall Steamship Company and (
Carlton C. Crane, agent on this coast
of the Vanderbllt lines. The three got
up the ladder in no time, eager to greet
the young traveler. -The moment they
reached the main deck they looked about
expecting to see him, but he was not
in sight. They started out in different
directions to search, but after three min
utes met amidships unsuccessful.
The chase was beginning to be exciting
and there Is no telling what might have
happened had not Vanderbilt's valet ap
eared on the scene and recognized Me-
Lane. "Under his guidance the reception
party was conducted to the lower deck,
where Vanderbllt was found perched on
his pile of trunks. After a greeting from
MeLane and Introductions to the others
the young millionaire was quickly con
ducted to another ladder, down which he :
went into the cabin of the tug, where he
remained Invisible all the time the others
supervised the transfer of his half-dozen
trunks and the valet. Then the Milieu
Griffith was headed for Oakland mole
without one of the large crowd on the
dock having had an opportunity of even :
seeing an eyelash of the beardless mil- j
lionaire.
At the Oakland mole Vanderbllt and
those accompanying him were ensconced
in a special car and carefully guarded
from intrusion. The car was coupled to
. the overland train and went out at 6 i
o'clock, MeLane accompanying the young
heir.
As fast as steam will carry him young
Vanderbllt will Journey to New York,
where the will of his dead father will be
opened. Under its provisions, it is re
. ported, he will be the principal heir, to
: the partial exclusion of his elder brother,
Cornelius, whose marriage to .Miss Wil
son estranged him from his father.
Alfred O. Vanderbllt also had a love
affair, which, as near as can be Judged
from appearances, did not suit the elder
Vanderbilt in all particulars. The young
woman in the case is Miss Elsie French,
daughter of the late Francis Osmond
French, who made a large fortune in the
hotel business in New York. Young Van
derbllt, who ls little more than twenty
one years of age, met and fell In love with
Miss French (Turing his college career at
Yale. He wanted to marry her immedi
ately after taking his degree, but his
father objected on account of his extreme
youth and persuaded him to delay his
marriage until after his tour around the
globe. The young lover left New Fork
July 20, for Vancouver, in company with
Douglas Cochrane, William P. Burden
and Ernest Iselin, and took passage for
Japan. He received news of his father's
death in Japan and took the City of
Peking for San Francisco.
Captain and passengers on the ship
speak 'admiringly of the young million
aire. They say he was democratic to a
degree and merged freely with his ship
mates. : . ?â â¢ 7

OAKLAND, Oct. 9.â The Coroner's Jury,
at the inquest on the death of Levi
Samuels, held to-night, found that death
was due to carbolic poison, taken while

had complained of ill health yesterday
and remained locked up in his room to

NO INQUEST.
Coroner Hill Dispenses With a Jury
and Renders a Verdict All by
Himself.
Coroner Hill announced yesterday that
he would not hold an Inquest in the case
of the young Mexican woman, Refugio
Batiz, who was found dead in bed last
Saturday morning at 143915 Washington
street. The Coroner took the statements,
not under oath, of the girl's relatives and
others in the house, to the effect that she
had accidentally turned on the pass in
her room after having turned it out and
was accidentally asphyxiated.
The circumstances that the gas fixtures
were in perfect order, that the girl had
turned them off and on for several months
without accident, and that she was to
have left for Mexico on the day on which
she was discovered dead, had evidently
convinced the Coroner that her death was

PHELAN ASKS GRAND
JURY TO INVESTIGATE
REFERS HOSPITAL AFFAIRS TO
THAT BODY.
Charges Board of Supervisors With
Jobbery and Makes Other Seri
ous Allegations.
In a letter to the Grand Jury apropos
of the deplorable state of affairs at the
City and County Hospital and the pest
house, Mayor Phelan yesterday made di
rect charges of Jobbery against the Board
of Supervisors, and, by inference, made
accusations of even a more serious nature.
The contractors have dally urged some
plan whereby their claims might be paid
and fresh supplies provided the starving
inmates of the county's medical institu
tion. . Chairman Perrault of the Finance
Committee was willing. to pay their back
claims, but declined to allow any expendi
ture in excess of the one-twelfth act, or
that would result in a deficit in any of
the funds over which ho exercised juris
diction.
With a mob of hungry contractors and
another of hungry patients to hear from
each day, the matter became unpleasant,
to say the least, and yesterday the Mayor
unloaded It on the Grand Jury in the fol
lowing letter:
To the Honorable, the Grand Jury of the
City and County^ of San FranciscoâGentle
men: I desire, In pursuance of my duty under
the consolidation act, to call your attention to
the mismanagement of the City and County
Hospital, by which deficits have been created
in it.-* funds, causing suffering to the patients
and injury to the reputation of the city.
In the fiscal year of 1898-9. (90,000 was ap
propriated for the hospital and JSOOO for re
pairs. This fiscal year $90,000 has been appro
priated for the hospital and $5000 for repairs.
Ninety thousand dollars Is all the law allows
the Board of Supervisors to appropriate for
tho maintenance of the hospital. In addition
we have appropriated $5500 for the smallpox
hospital for this year. The only tax levy which
baa any legal validity is tho tax levy adopted
by the Supervisors on the third Monday of
September, but In order to guide th. Auditor,
on August 7, 1599. the Supervisors passed a res
olution (3076) fixing the limit of expenditure,
which they subsequently altered as to the item
of repairs In finally making the levy. In that
resolution $90,000 was also estimated for the
maintenance of tho hospital, but $23,210 was
allowed for repairs.
Now, under no circumstances could the Hos
pital Committee of the Board of Supervisors
under the provisions of the one-twelfth act ex
pend more than $7500 each month for the main
tenance of the hospital, which, if prudently
employed, is, as your Investigation will no
doubt show, amply sufficient for Its purpose.
For the months of July, August and September
of this fiscal year the Supervisors, through
their Hospital Committee, have exceeded the
limit and violated the law. I therefore ask .an
Investigation on your part In order to fix the
responsibility for such violation and for the
extravagant prices, amounting to Jobbery, paid
for non-contract supplies. The Board of Su
pervisors is responsible for the supplies and
repairs and the Board of Health for the em
ployes. As there Is one employe for every
three patients. I am convinced that the number
Ib excessive and should be reduced.
I Inclose to you a list of gentlemen who no
doubt will aid you by testifying at your In
vestigation. Respectfully,
JAMES D. PHELAN, Mayor.

Peking in Port.
AMERICA MARU ALSO ARRIVES
â¢ * . .
PUT BACK TO YOKOHAMA BE
CAUSE OF FIRE.
Captain Cope Suspended for Three
Months and Chief Engineer
Seaver Censured by a
Japanese Court.
Four big steamers came In through the
fog that hung over the Golden Gate yes
terday. They were the Oiympia that
comes here to be used as a transport, the
Toyo Kisen Kalsha's America Maru, the
overdue mall steamer City of Peking and <
the anxiously expected Pennsylvania, with
the Washington troops aboard. The
Peking and Pennsylvania met the heavy
weather off the Japanese coast that de
layed the Solace. The first day out of
Yokohama the Peking made 292 knots.
The next day a storm was raging and
only 160 knots were made. The third day
it was blowing a hurricane and the Peking I
made 90 knots. The fourth day she made |
100 knots and the fifth 134 knots. On the !
sixth day the steamer had run out of the i
storm and after that she had fair weather i
until within two days of San Francisco,
when a strong head wind and heavy sea j
were encountered.
The officers of the America Maru had a
great laugh at the expense of the Peking
when that vessel docked. The America
Maru had to put back to Yokohama be
' cause of a fire In her coal bunkers. All
flof her passengers were transferred to the
Peking with the expectation that they
would be in San Francisco several days
before the America Maru arrived. The
Peking sailed eight days before the Amer
ica Maru and got caught In the hurricane
and was delayed at Honolulu. The Amer
ica Maru came straight across from Yo
kohama in twelve days and fifteen hours,
beating the Peking about four hours into
port. :..".;
Captain Cope of the America Maru says
the transport Tartar, with the Kansas
boys aboard, sailed two days ahead of
them and should reach here this morning.
He thinks he passed the Tartar Saturday
night in the fog, but is not sure. In
that event she will undoubtedly reach port
to-day. The story of the Are in the Amer
ica Mam's bunkers was told by Purser
Comfort yesterday. He said:
"We reached Yokohama September 7 and
were detained twenty-four hours owing
to a strong smell of gas coming from the
bunkers. An investigation was made but
tho temperature of the bunkers was low
and we came to the conclusion -that there
was no fir-- and that the gas was due to
the coal- drying. "We. sailed for Honolulu
on the: 10th and on September 13 there
were smoke and a strong smell of burn
ing coal from No. 2 hold. The ship was
stopped. All the ventilators were closed
and the steam fire extinguisher was
turned on. Captain Cope had a consulta
tion with his officers and it was decided
to return to Yokohoma. There was no
excitement among the passengers, as they
had every confidence in the ship's officers.
On our arrival at Yokohama we trans
ferred all our passengers and the Hono
lulu freight to the Peking.
"The fire destroyed very little-cargo, but
tho steam and water did considerable
damage. The bottom of the coal bunker
was burned out, but the coal was only
charred. . The rice, cinnamon, coffee, mat
ting, tea and other merchandise that was
damaged was sold at auction in Yoko
hama. ;;;"..' :.
"Captain Cope and Chief Engineer Sea
ver were tried at Tokio by a Japanese
marine court of inquiry, and the cap
tain's certificate as suspended for three
months. The chief engineer was cen
sured. Both officers have appealed the
case, and they were allowed to come out
on the vessel pending the decision of the
upper court. The ship has been restored
to her rating by Lloyd's, and she is now
as good as the day she was launched."
The transport Pennsylvania was thirty
four days coming from Manila via Toko

diers aboard had a lively time of it. The
Pennsylvania is now lying off Folsom

this morning. The soldiers will disem
bark about 9:30 a m., and will then march
out to the Presidio.
The pilot boat Grade S and the schooner

RAIN IS COMING SOON.
Forecaster McAdie Will Warn the
Raisin Growers.
"I am going to Issue a general rain fore
cast immediately," said Weather Official
McAdie last evening, as he was busy
studying the reports which had been sent
in from all parts of the country.
"I desire to warn the raisin growers
who are at present drying their fruit," he
continued, "that all the atmospheric con
ditions call for rain. I have been criti
cized by a few captious people because I
have predicted rain so early in October,
and, as they say, with a desire on my
part to force the season; but I presume to
know a little more about the subject than
they do. I have been studying the rain
fall of this State covering a period of fifty
years, and I find that the statistics show
that in twenty-eight out of the fifty sea
sons there has been rain far In advance
of this date in October. In fact, this is a
comparatively dry season.
"There la quite a storm coming from
Mexico, with high winds on the northern
side of it. At Eureka It is blowing thirty
two miles from the north; Ked Bluff
twenty-eight miles. Point Reyes sixty,
Sacramento twenty-eight, and San Fran
cisco will in all likelihood have high
winds Tuesday. Rain is falling all over
Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and it is now
snowing at Lander, in Wyoming, where
the temperature is 34.
"In this city it is now 26 degrees cooler
to-day, the thermometer registering 61, as
against 90 at the same time Sunday night,
and it will get colder. There are high
north winds all along the coast. There is
a little hot weather left at San Luis Obis
po, where it Is 94, and Los Angeles, 90.
It is cloudy north of Independence, where
the barometer is 29.43 and still falling.
The storm may go through Nevada, and
If it should reach this coast and meet a
low pressure outside we will certainly get
rain.
"That is why I will hoist the rain sig
nals, as I do not Intend that the fruit
growers shall suffer damage or loss be
cause of lack of warning on my part."
WILL REPORT ON THE
ORIENTAL COMMERCE
COMMISSIONER NEIDEBLEIN'S
INVESTIGATIONS.
Recommends the Establishment in
China of Bureaus Where Infor
mation Can Be Obtained.
Among the distinguished passengers
brought in on the steamer Peking yester
day was Gustave Nelderlein, United
States Commercial Commissioner to tha
Orient.
Mr. Neiderlein is connected with the
Philadelphia Museum of Commerce,
which institution sent him out to the East
some time ago to study and report on the
commercial conditions of those far-away
countries. : " y~. V:
Commissioner Neiderlein made an ex
tensive tour through, the Orient, going
well into the interior of both China and
Japan, and is now on his way back to
Philadelphia to give the museum the ben
efit of his researches.
When seen last evening at the Palace
Hotel, where he is staying, Mr. Neider
lein said: "Yes, 1 have been spending
some time in the Orient and am on my
way back to tell those who sent me what
I think will be of the greatest benefit to
the commerce of this country with these
great nations that rest on the under side
of the world. While I was in the Orient
I made several trips well into the interior
to study the topography of the country
with the view of ascertaining the rela
tive commercial value of tho different
great waterways. What the result of
these trips were is contained in my re
port and is altogether too long to make
any mention of now. Suffice to say I
found both China and Japan, particularly
China, intersected with navigable streams
which will of immense service In help
ing the development of the cities and vil
lages that lie inland away from the
coast.
"When I get home I shall strongly
recommend the establishment of several
bureaus of commercial information at
different points throughout China and
Japan where business can be transacted
and where information of every sort of a
commercial enterprise in which the
United States are interested can be read
ily obtained.
"The Chinese and Japanese are intelli
gent, quick and industrious people, who
are more than willing to advance as rap
idly as possible in a commercial way.
Their greatest difficulty, however, is to
ascertain what really is on the market In
this country and the cost of machinery,
bridges, railways, and, In fact, everything
that tends toward the onward progress of
a nation. This knowledge these bureaus
of information would be able to supply.
"I would establish one at Hongkong to
cover the southern territory, and one at
Shanghai, which would take care of the
north. These .would be the two
principal . â¢ bureaus, but other and
smaller ones could be. opened where
they would do the most V good . as
the occasion for them presents 'it
self. Another thing which would be of
great benefit to this country, and which
would prove of Immense value in â¢ the
transaction of business, would be the es
tablishment of an American bank. We
have none in the Orient at present, and
the want of one is very badly felt in
deed."
Mr. Neiderlein will remain in the city
but a short while, as his .intention Is to
depart as soon as possible for Philadel
phia. ' - "â :

i 330 MARKET ST. aF.SS^ONE MORE CLEW
TO THE ROBBERY
OF THE ALAMEDA
Lees Finds a Valuable
Witness.
â¦
STORY TOLD BY J. W. WINTON
Â« â¦
SAYS LEWIS AND MURPHY
WERE ON THE MARIPOSA.
â¦
The Former Told Him He Had a Big
Job On â Sovereigns Stole.. Be
fore the Alameda Reached
Auckland.
Chief cf Police Lees yesterday secured
information which he claims will prove
of great value in unravelnig the mys
tery surrounding the robbery on the
steamship Alameda last May, when a box
conta'ning 5000 sovereigns was stolen
from the strongroom of the vessel on the
trip from Sydney, Australia, to this port.
The man who furnished the Chief with
this valuable in'onnation is J. W. Win
ton, the ventriloquist, now playing an
..-gagement at the Orpheum, who arrived
c- the City -Pa* - from Honolulu.
The story tcld by Winton fully explains
certain matters that have ali along puz
zled the police, and clearly establishes the
connection of the man Lewis with the
gang which the Chief has maintained
from tha first committed the rotroery.
Winton sailed from San Francisco for j
Audtiaad on April 20 on the steamer
Mariposa, and Lewis, who traveled an- â 
<ier the name cf Murphy, was a fellow
passenger. Lewis had known Winton in
A'_stra.:-i- and was known by the latter .
as a croon. During the voyage Lewis be- ,
came quite confidential and intimated
plainly that he had "something on" that
w :_li pan out big.
"If you knew what I know," he told ]
Winton confidentially, "you wouldn't be
working those "dummies' for a living,"
r^'-rrr.ng to the lay figures used by tho I
v~-.:r.ioqu-3t.
Ihat's all right. I am on to your
f - -me." replied Winton, "but I don't make
i.iy living that way.".
Lewis was rolling in wealth on the voy
age ever and as he was drunk a greater
part of the t.me hâ¬ gave the mate 1300
. '.verei.-TT-s to keep for him. Winton also
noticed that Lewis spent hours each day
in close conversation with a steerage pas- !
ienger, and -when asked by Chief Lees to
describe tne man gave a detailed -crip
tion of the member of the gang who was
known in San Francisco by the name of
'. r dy, but whose real name is Murphy.
That was just the information the Chief
was a_-.^r. as it establishes the identity
cf the fÂ»o members of the gang who
were passengers on the steamer on that |
trip.
Winton also says he saw Cooper, alias :
Casey; who is now in this city, and Kelly, j
w ':-. o is serving a four years' sentence in ]
a Mexican prison for getting away with j
.' JOfl from a bank in the City cf Mexico.
i n thi: Mariposa just before the vessel
c -::~d 4 irorn this port, in conversation with j
Lewis.
Another fact in connection with the rob
bery, according to Chief Lees, that has
not been published heretofore is that the
box of sovereigns was stolen between Syd
ney and Auckland. This contention of the
Chief is based on information furnished
by a lad named Cook, who was ship's hov
er, the Alameda. He went into the strong
room when the steamer was three days
out of Sydney, and through curiosity
counted the boxes containing the sover
eigns. He counted them three times, and
there were twenty-nine. There should
have been thirty, although the boy was!
unaware of that fact. Chief Lees knows :
where Cook is. ar.d can produce him at ;
i.r.y time. The robbery was not discov
ered by the officers of the steamer until
within three days cf Honolulu.
The Mariposa arrived at Auckland on !
May I-. 1 , an.i the Alameda left Sydney on ',
May 11. arriving at Auckland on the 13th, !
giving Lewis and Murphy plenty of time
to arrange for receiving the stolen gold, i
It has also been learned that the lock on i
the door of the steamer's strongroom
could be removed and replaced without j
removing the seal. But while these facts
are important in providing clews to the !
perpetrators of the robbery, the identity |
of the robbers themseK-es is yet a mys
tery. Chief Lees is greatly encouraged by
â¢he information furnished by Winton, I
however, especially the suggestion made
by the latter that Lewis is in all proba
bility somewhere in Western Australia.
The exact whereabouts of Murphy, or :
Brody. is not known, but the Chief an-
ticipates little trouble in locating him
when wanted.
ST. IGNATIUS SODALITY

Well Known Organization Will Have
a Special Night at the Youths'
Directory Fair.
There is no diminution in the crowds
which attend the Youths' Directory ba
zaar, at the League of the Cross armory.
Market street, near Tenth. Last night
the booths, made attractive by the pretty
articles tastefully displayed, did & rush
ing business. The pleadings of the ladies
In charge are irresistible, and the visitors
to the fair never leave withoit giving
some of their money to the good cause.
The bazaar will close on Saturday even
ing next, and the friends of Father Crow
ley and his band of enthusiastic workers
are Socking there in large numbers. Each
night during the week an interesting pro*
gramme will be presented and ought to
prove an additional incentive to others to
visit the fair.
Last night the ladles of St. Anthony's :
booth held a "night at home." In honor '
of the occasion the League of the Cross ,
band played selections and an interest- i
ir.z programme was rendered.
To-night the St. Ignatius Sodality, num- :
bering fIX) m-n, will attend In a body.
James R. Kelly, president of the Hibernia
Bank and prefect of the sodality, ap
pealed to the members to visit the fair.
and resolution- were adapted in favor of
the er.tire organization going there to- 1
night. It will be a red-letter night at the
fair.; A special programme for the enter- !
tainment of the sodality ha 3 been ar
ranged.
The refreshment booth. if. charge of i
Mrs. Lswler. is still doing a rushing bus!-'

is leading Jeremiah Deasy, the Democrat

them to do better.
CLAIMS ARISING FROM
SAMOAN TROUBLES
Conference Between the Representa-
tive of This and the English
Government.
WASHINGTON, Oct. >.â Mr Tower.
Charge d' Affaires of Great Britain, con
ferred with acting Secretary of State Hill :
to-day relative to the payment of claims
filed aeainst the three governments sig
natory to the Berlin ... as the result j
of the recent Samoan trouble.
Man claims for indemnity have been
Sled with the British Government by its j
subjects resident in Sam a whose prop- i
arty was damaged by the operations of j
the natives, and it is understood that the
German claims amount to a large sum.
There are few Americans in Samoa, and
the claims filed are few. The German and
British Governments are said to have
agreed to arbitrate the claims.
While this Government is favorable to
the principle of arbitration. It does not
propose, where its claims are so few and j
small in amount, to be put in a position
where it may have to give an ec.ua! share
for the settlement of the claims of the ]
citizens of other Governments. -Besides.
it is said that the United States ls not re
sponsible for the damage committed, and
former Chief Justice Chambers, in an j
identical report to the three Governments, <
held that the Germans were responsible. '
The high Joint Samoa.. Commission made i
::o provision for the settlement cf claims.:
leaving this matter to the three Govern-
Clients to determine.
Jockey Killed at Chicago.
CHICAGO. Oct. S.â J. Boyd, a well
known steeplechase rider, was killed at j
Hawthorne to-day. The accident occurred
In the third race, a steeplechase. As the !
horses swung toward the fence Boyd i
swerved his mount. Globe 11. with the â '
seaming intention of carrying Cheesemite
out of the course. He succeeded, but i
Globe II crashed against the wing of the
hardie and turned a complete somersault,
colliding with and knocking down Three
Forks and crushing Boyd so badly that
he died_while -being conveyed to the hos- i
pital. The judges, ignorant of the exto.it
of Boyd'- injuries, investigated the ac- j
tion of Boyd in crowding Ch^semite out!
of the course and ruled him off the track
before the news of the unfortunate jock- :
ey's death was received.

NICARAGUAN CANAL
CONCESSIONS LAPSE
-Maritime Company Shortly to Lose j
Its Eights, but Will Make No
Effort for Eene-wal.
WASHINGTON', Oct. 3.-Thursday will
see the expiration of the concession
granted to the Maritime Canal Company
by the N'lcaraguan Government for the :
construction of the N'lcaraguan canal, ;
and on the same Late the concession
granted by the Zei.: Government to
Messrs. Eyre and Cragin will begin.
There Is no intention on the part of the j
officials to Interfere to secure a renewal â¢
of the Maritime company's concession.
All matters relating to the canal, ex- ]
cept the abrogation of the , Clayton-
Bulwer treaty, will remain in'*statu quo
until the Isthmian Canal Commission has |
reported. Persistent rumors are current j
in official circles that those interested in i
the Eyre-Cragin concession and the Mari- j
time Company intend to consolidate their ;
Interests. By such a move it is said the '
Maritime Company's interests would be \
partly protected, while the Eyre-< '
syndicate would be able to secure the !
rights held by the Maritime Company In

Special -,-â¢-.- The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C, Oct. -.âThe grave
: yard of the Pacificâ the west coast of
i Vancouver Islandâ has added another ves
i sel to the already large list which have
I met with disaster there. The latest v.c
--! rim of these rocky shores is the American
! barkentlne Uncle John. According to
! news wired by the lighthouse-keeper at
Cape Beale the Uncle John is a total loss
on the rock-hound island coast. She was
driven ashore during the heavy gales of
last Saturday and swept by the storm
tossed seas nigh up on the rocks about
fourteen miles to the westward of Car
manah Point, about eighty miles from
Victoria, where one of the two light
houses of the Dominion Government on
tits west coast Is situated.
The Uncle John was on tier way up from
Honolulu to the Sound when she ended
her â â .--.- en the west coast. She was
blown by the gales, assisted by the cur
rents, which'set northward above be en
trance to the straits, and endeavoring to
beat down she got too close In shore and
was swept to total wreck on the rocks.
As far as can be learned, ail her crew
are safe. Fortunately for them, the ship
did not strike the range of cliffs which
runs along for some distance in the vi
cinity of where she struck. She struck
a low-lying stretch and was driven well
upon the rocks, thus giving her crew a
chance to save themselves. Ha . she
struck a little farther down the coast
few if any would have survived. "'-'^
The men are encamped on the beach to
the south of Cape Beale. The lighthouse
keeper has gone to them with a supply
of food and warm clothing. I: is expected
that they will he brought here to-morrow.
A report reached- here to-night that
the steamer Princess Louise has been
wrecked on Skeena. She is three days
overdue.

MUTINY QUELLED
BY CONSUL HARRIS
Attacked the Ringleader
on the Newport.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
YOKOHAMA, Sept. 25.â The Twentieth
Kansas has come and gone, adding ma- '.
terially to the very favorable impression
made by all the American troops who
have passed through here on their home- i
ward way.
The one man who has been the center i
of attraction has, -' course, been General
Funston. His modest. bearing and strong
personality have made him as great a j
favorite among the citizens as he mani- j
festiy is among the men of his own rcgi- j
ment.
The war has developed another hero.
this time In the person of United States
Consul Harris of Nagasaki. The occa- .
sion, sad .0 say, was one of the most dis
creditable episodes of the war. The 1
transport Newport, on its homeward {
voyage, had on board a large contingent
of discharged soldiers. These men, find
tag that they outnumbered the rest of
the passengers, and filled with an over
whelming sense of the reacquired citl
sens hip, carried things with a high hand, i
Dissatisfied with their accommodations
they practically took possession of the
ship, and driving the officers from their
quarters Installed themselves therein.
On arrival at Nagasaki Consul Harris,
being apprised of the affair, went on
board with four Japanese policemen.
The Cor..-. is a little deaf, and on
boarding the Newport was met by the
leader of the mutineers with the ques- \
tion, "Are you the Consul of the United i
States?" Owing to his affliction the Con
sul was compelled to ask his, lnterrogator
to repeat his question several times, j
which, the mutineer did, each time in ai
louder voice.
The same tactics were prevalent dur
ing the entire episode, turning a scene, j
which otherwise might have been/dra-i
matic and effective, ... something
which appealed broadly to the American j
sense of humor. The fact that he was ;
the Consul being finally . sited the lead- j
er said to him. every word having to be
constantly repeated in louder tones: You
just keep yourself out of this affair. We j
are free Americans and now have things
on board this boat as we want them and i
we propose to keep them there, I have |
hundreds of men at my back." As this
assertion was at last shouted into the â¢
ear of the Consul he said: "You are the:
leader of these men, are you? Well, you !
are lust the man I want." With that "the
consular hand descended on the ring
leader's collar and the consular foot
curled around the leader's legs, tripping
â him on deck and the American citizen
was passed into the keeping of the four
tittle Japanese policemen amid the plaud
its of every one on board, including the j
mutineers themselves.
SURVEY OF GRAND CANYON.
Engineers to Travel Through the
Great Send Region of Texas.
AUSTIN. Oct. 3.â Professor Robert T.
Hill of the United States Geodetic Survey
and party, who are making an official
survey of the great tend region of Texas.
left Presidio, Texas, two days ago on their
voyage through the Grand Canyon of the
Rio Grande.
With the exception of a Mexican guide
who accompanies them they are the first
persons to undertake a trip through the
canyon. Recent heavy rains have caused
a isi. rise in the Rio Grande and all the
journey can be made by boats. The Mex
ican guide says the trip is full of peril
and there ar* many wonderful thin-rs to
be seen in the canyon. The party will
make their exit from the canyon near Del
Rio. about -i.*' 1 miles below Presidio, the
starting point.
HOME FOR SPIRITUALISTS.
Young Men's Christian Association
Building at San Joss Pur
chased.
SAN* JOSE. Oct. oâ The First Spiritual
Union of this city is new. the possessor of
a magnificent home and will dedicate the
same on October _S by a reception to Mrs.
Eunice S. Sleeper, the donor. The deed
went on record to-<lay by which the
Young Men's Christian Association build
ing on Second street, between St. John
and Santa Clara streets, became the prop
erty of the spiritualists. ThÂ»e building was
old-time cathartics and liver medicines,
which were disagreeable to the taste
and frequently injurious as â well. The
more one takes of salts and pills the
more constipated the system becomes;
while orn the other hand one enjoys both
the method and results when Syrup of
Figs is taken. It is pleasant and re
freshing to the taste and acts gently
yet promptly on the kidneys, liver and
bowels; cleanses the system effectual
ly, dispels colds, headaches and fevers
and overcomes habitual constipation
permanently; also bilious â¢- and the
many ills resulting therefrom. The
great trouble with all other purgatives
and aperients is not that they fail to
act, when a single dose is taken, but
that they act too violently and inva-
sold to satisfy a mortgage a few months â 
. ago and the spiritualists bought it from i
' the Security Bank for $1.-500. (
Mrs. Sleeper, who is a devout follower I
! of spiritualism, a few years ago gave j
j $.4,000 for its advancement, creating what j
jis known as the Sleeper trust fund. At j
i the last State convention the San Jose
j Union obtained permission to invest part |
â  of the funds and the purchase to-day was j
I their choice. The building is centrally .
j located and originally cost in the neigh
borhood of $25,000. The name of the build-
I ing will be changed to the "Temple of I
! Spiritualism." Mrs. Sleeper is now an ;
, inmate of the Pratt Home and her recep- '
1 tion on the -Sth Inst, will also celebrate
her eighty-fifth birthday.
OBJECT TO QUARANTINE
BY STATE OF TEXAS
Officials of Louisiana Preparing to
Fight the Matter in the
Supreme Court.
AUSTIN, Texas. Oct. 9.â Governor Say
-- to-day received a telegram from At
torney General Milton J. Cunningham of
Louisiana, notifying him that on October
16 the State of Louisiana will apply to the
Supreme Court of the United States for
a preliminary Injun.- to restrain the
State of Texas, her Governor and her
Health Officer. Dr. William F. Blount,
from establishing and maintaining an em
bargo on interstate commerce between
the State of Louisiana and the State of
Texas, operated under the guise of quar
antine. This proposed application for an
injunction is the culmination of constant
and vigorous protests that the business
men of New Orleans have made against
the maintenance of yellow fever quaran
tine by the State of Texas against New
Orleans. At .-.: time has Texas main
tained a quarantine against the State of
Louisiana, and Governor Bayers and At
torney General Smith are confident of de
feating the injunction application on that
ground.
Attorney General Smith will leave to
morrow for Washington to represent this
State in the case. The Southern Pacific
and the Texas and Pacific railway com
panies and the two Texas and New Or
leans lines will support the Texas quar
antine by means of affidavits as to its ne
cessity. Attorney General Smith also
takes the position that no State has the
legal right to question or interfere with
the police powers of another State.

destruction of nearly three thousand ;
houses. As it is a town of 50. 'X,*; inhab- j
itants this means the wiping out of about |
one-fourth of ' em. Within a little more
than a month three great fires, in Yoko- j
hama. Toyama and Hakodate, have de- ,
stroyed upward of 11,000 houses, a fact
which has led to at serious discussion in !
the native press as to whether the time !
has not come for the adoption of an en- I
tirely different style of urban architecture,
in order to prevent so frequent a recur- |
rence of these disastrous conflagrations. I
Shanghai is excited over the ghastly
news from Newohang. where a Govern- i
ment doctor sent to make investigations
discovered four depots containing -000
fresh coffins of plague victims waiting to I
be sent to their native provinces. The <
Doyen of the diplomatic corps at Peking '
has wit to the Tsung-li-Tan- to put
a stop to the export of coffins from New- j

The great hall of EI rniak, which is .
the most notable of the monuments of 1
Thebes of its class. Is 170 feet long and I
320 feet wide. The stone roof, now par- 1
tially in ruins, was originally supported
by 134 columns, the loftiest of which were j
near!;. seventy feet high and about
twelve feet in diameter. It was built by I
Zetee I and sculptured partly in his reign, i
work upon it being continued, by his son !
and successor. Raraesis 11.
The hall commemorates, not in its
grandeur alone but also by its 'sculp- |

two Pharaohs. The sculptures of the in- j

Dried Fruit in New York.
The New York Commercial says:
"After throe days' suspension of business
trade opened in iairly liberal volume. The:.
was a considerable accumulation of mail orders
to be filled and numerous Inquiries to be an
swered. A few buyers were in market, having
come to the celebration and stayed over to dc
some necessary business. Actual sales, on th(
average, wore small, but there was a bettei
feeling indicated, and the impression was
given that actual transactions will be target
and prices belter on most descriptions. A con
siderable number of visitors are expected tc
the yacht races who will make their purchaseÂ»
of dried fruits before they return.
"Raisins are the most active, and spot good;
are selling readily at lull quotations. Th*
short crop In California and the total cleaning
up of the market are expected to compel heav.
sales, notwithstanding the high prices. Buyer;
feel safer in taking, liberal supplies than ihej
did last year, because the association ha;
proven Itself capable of controlling the situa
tion and fulfilling its promises to both grower:
and buyers.
"Pruie-s are not selling very freely as yet
but there is more Inquiry and the outlook foi
good trade is more premising, lt Is said thai
negotiations are in progress for two or thro
large blocks, but the particulars of the trans
actions have not been given out. It is con
ceded that sales will be heavy, once they be
gin, and prices are quite likely to rule better.
.'Peaches are in better position, but the mar
ket is still weak and unsatisfactory to holders
The Western demand for small sizes is not ai
strong as last week, but there are still con
siderable sales at full previous quotations. Th.
entire yield is not yet known, but it is very
large, and prices will do little better until tht
uncertainty is ended.
"AprlcdtS are firm, and In view of small sup
plies prices tend up.ward. Exporters contlnu.
to show considerable interest, and domestic
buyers are also seeking larger supplies. The
result is additional firmness In prices and a
probability that an advance will be made short
ly on tlie most wanted grades."

EASTERN MARKETS.
New York Stock Market.
NEW TORK, Oct. 9.â Buying by arbitrage
houses for London account made the highest
prices for the day in the general list at the
opening, As soon as that demand was satis
fied the market began to drag. There was some
support when prices of the iron and steel stocks
were bid up, but the fact was obvious that,
there was no vital demand for securities, 'I '1
the downward drift was renewed. By the close
of the day the gains were wiped out except In
a few cases. Steel and Wire was an exception
end ruse 3 pcdnts on reports of new properties
acquired; most of the gain being retained. Su
gar and Tobacco enjoyed their period of
strength, but both closed at net losses. There
was. some large buying of United States
Leather, but its gain was not maintained.
Omaha preferred, which last sold at IS7>, was
offered at IS3 and from that down to 176 with
out takers. St. Paul preferred sold illy '.it
171 and later at 16J.
The bond man.et seems rather weaker than
has been the case up to this time, reflecting
the high prevailing rates for money. Th- situa
tion in the money market showed very little
change, loans being made as high as' 19 per
cent, and as low as 6 per cent. .The majority of
loans were made at from 6 to 8 per cent. Gold
shipped from Europ>e. ls now in New York
vaults and no more is to be expected for the
present from that source. It was reported that
the Treasury Department had decided to antici
pate the November 1 payment of Interest, as
was done last year, but no announcement of
such di cisic.n came from Washington.
The detailed statement of New York banks
on Saturday showed more than half the mem
bers of the; clearing-house are still 1" low the
legal reserve limit and the necessary conse
quence was a further calling of ioans. Hanks
in the West and even in Canada are reported
to be placing call loans on the Stock Exchange.
By the calling of loans by New York banks,
which thus made necessary the putting up of
the call loan rate in New York, the Western
banks are getting the advantage of the higher
rate for their surplus funds, which are placed
In Wall street. Earlier in the season Wall
street expected to be relieved from the usual
pressure for crop moving money on account of
the large reserves in Western banks. But the
latter have found a more profitable method of
conducting operations. Sterling exchange eas-^.l
off in sympathy at' Paris and Berlin, but held
rtlff in New York for demand bills and cables
The bond market was dull and weak. Totai
sales, par value, ii.sw.oco. â 
United States bonds were unchanged In bid
quotaticms.

The general tone of the markets here. to-day
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY,
was fairly cheerful, but trading was not on
a large scale because of the settlement which
begins to-morrow. The better feeling was
caused by the hopes of peace in the Trans
vaal Inspired by the attitude of the resident
of the Orange Free State and the news that
the Boers on the border are tired of waiting
and are retiring, leaving only sentries in their
places. Good Board of Trade returns and an
easing market for money helped the markets
considerably, Consols were up >* to 103%.
Americans developed strength steadily, but
closed somewhat under the best, affected prob
ably by the receipt of New York prices under
those in London, It was a great Louisville
and Nashville day. and the boomers of the
stock are talking 120 for it. Atchison preferred
and Northern Pacific were also in good de
mand. Spanish 4s were 60%: TintOS, 47'j. Ana

"The activity noted In our review of Septem

quiet. Costa Rlcas have all been absorbed and
the light stocks of other kinds is of a generally j
undesirable character. Dealers' stocks are, |
however, heavy and well assorted and for this
reason a sluggish business may be anticipated j
until the advent of new crop coffees.

SARAH COMSTOCK.
â t
Grand Opera-House.
The long-haired musical wonders may
shake their reverend heads .over the
merry songs which they are pleased to
call a jlngie of tones, but the public will
revtr cease to entertain a particular af
fection for operas like "Girofle-Girofia."
wherein jolly music and bright dialogue
unite in producing a pleasant entertain
ment. One thing must be put to the credit
of the Grand Opera-house, ar.d that Is the
] ains taken in the production of its plays.
There is never a hitch in th^ performance.
The mounting, costumes and chorus pre
sent always a chic appearance.
The title role of the opera, is perhaps one
of Miss Mason's foremost artistic achieve
ments. Not alone does she sing her part
with exceeding taste and clear voice, but
her appearance is very agreeable to the
most exacting eye, and her deportment
never lacks that refinement necessary for
the comic opera stage. This latter fact
was particularly demonstrated during the
"tipsy" scene, wherein so many sou
brette? are wont to overact. The change
from Girolle to Giroila in tlie last act was
a skillful piece of stage ' business, for
there was hardly any one in the audience
who noticed it. If you desire a model
piece of impersonation do not fail to see
Edith Mason this week.
Of course Persse sang well: he aiways j
does. But last night he did something ;
else: he looked well too. In fact, he has j
seldom looked handsomer since his en- 1
gagement at the Grand. There is a great J
deal in looking the part. It is half or' the '
dramatic battle won. William Wolff was |
hardly fierce enough as the ferocious j
Moor.' One could not exactly discover why .
all these people were so afraid of him.
A little more "ginger" would not do harm.
Arthur Wooley had one of his fatherly
roles which he knows so well how to han
die; especially when he counts up the vir
tues of his "better half." Winfred Goff
has riot so much to do this week, but
what Is allotted to him is executed with
much care. His few solos are rendered j
with artistic finish.
The chorus does some snappy work and j
the many pretty faces one encounters i
therein add muc.i to the finishing touches
of a performance, the smoothness oi;
â¢which indicates a first-class stage man

again on the boards at the Tivoli Opera
house. The old theater-goers who were
present last night missed tlie songsters,
Helen Dingeon, Ethel Lynton. kert j
::r.d others, but the new cast did credit to |
this pretty opera. Ada Palmer Walker as
Satanella: took the part with credit and
Tom Greene (Count Rupert), the new
tenor, was in fine voice. Harry Girard as
the pirate chief. William Schuster as j
.Xrimar.es, king demon of the world, and i
Charlotte Beckwith as Stella, were also!
entertaining. Liberal applause was given ;
the old favorite, Arthur Messmer,
end Julie Cotte. who took the part of J
l.ciia. was also well received. "Satanella" |
will continue during the week, excepting i
this evening, which will be "Verdi night"
in honor of the maestro's eighty-seventh
linhday.
Alcazar.
The Alcazar stock company Is to be
congratulated on its creditable production i
cf "Jim the Penman" last night. The old j
j. lay is still of absorbing interest. Eugene
Ormonde appeared as Captain Redmond,
the detective, and his impersonation of j
the character stamped him as a versatile l
actor. There was nothing overdrawn and ;
every point was marked with distinctness
and no straining after effect. Miss Ger
trade Foster as Mrs. Ralston. the wife of
the "Penman," had evidently studied the
part carefully, and tlie result was a
finished and re-lined characterization. |
Miss He.en Henry was charming as ;
Agnes Ralston, the daughter, and Daniel j
Halifax as Jack Ralston. the .on. had a ;
congenial r;art. Charles W. King a* James
Ralston. the forger: C. F. Montalne as ;
Baron Hartfcld; Frank Denfthorne as â¢
J_ouls Percival and Charles Bryant as !
Lord Drelincourt played their parts well.
The piece was excellently mounted and |
the management has carried out its ;
promise to give an artistic ar.d dramatic i
presentation. j
Orpheum.
There >'s a tradition well nigh forgotten
that the Orpheum in the past had an .
"Qfl" week. This week is not one of those j
times. There Is nothing "off" about it;
It is strictly "on.". In fact, it is seldom!
that the wideawake management has sue- I
reeded '.n getting, together such a con- J
spicuous collection of stars. The best of
the new people this week are the. F>or- j
enzÂ» family. They ore daring acrobats j
and perform the most difficult rcats in
evening dress. The young man who is
the king of the troupe astonished the
spectators by the apparent ease with
which he performed that rare feat known i
as "full twisters" when somersaulting-]
from shoulder to shoulder. - ,
La Petite Elsie is a little girl who will
develop into a beautiful woman. She Is I

Why a Hot Wave Means Hard Labor for Oakland Officials.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, Oct. 9. 1899.
THE hot wave was unusually cruel to Oakland. In most cities, perhaps in all
cities but Oakland, sweltering human beings relax from their labors and make
themselves as comfortable as possible. It does not have this effect in this
city, especially among those who are enjoying a living at the taxpayer's
expense, because of the lavish and unwise policy that has been substituted for
government since Oakland was a city. Under ordinary' circumstances this small
army of "officials" had nothing whatever to do, except enjoy Oakland's beau
tiful climate, smoke cigars and draw their salaries. A hot wave cannot require
them to do less, but from motives purely selfish they are forced to work and
work hardâ for Oakland officials. It requires them to take off their coats,
which requires an almost superhuman effort on the part of some of the pension
ers who are rusting out In the public service. One of them was found this morn-
>ers on the programme afforded excel
ent entertainment.
Columbia.
"Hotel Topsy Turvy" thoroughly

LUCKLESS THIRTY-FIRST
Muster Out of the Volunteer
Signal Corps That Returned
on the Para.
The troubles of the Thirty-first were to
have ended to-day, for It was the Inten
tion to release the command from quar
antine, but the looked for freedom will
not come for a while yet, and if two cases
now under observation do not change
their symptoms It will be another two
weeks before the men may leave the isl
and.
There have been two suspicious cases ;
under observation tor some time, but lat
terly they have been developing undoubt
ed symptoms of smallpox. It Is not defi- ;
nitely known whether their symptoms are
the result of a too successful vaccina
tion or of infection from some case of :
the disease. It is known, however, that
whatever caused it, the two cases were
contracted on the island, a fact which .
makes their appearance all the more sig
nificant. To-day the surgeons will prob- I
ably know the exact nature of the dis- j
ease afflicting the two men, and should
it prove to be smallpov, however mild,
contracted from proximity to other cases,
the regiment will be held for two weeks
more.
This morning the volunteer signal corps
that came home on the Para will be mus- '
tered out. The corps is now at the re
cruit camp at the Presidio awaiting the
last call of the mustering officer and the
paymaster. "Tt numbers fifty-seven men,
under command of Captain Perkins, who i
as captain of the signal corps of the Sec
ond Brigade, N. G. ('., made a record for
efficiency In his chosen branch of the
service and for soldierly qualities second
only to the record he made while serving
as a volunteer.
The corps has done excellent service I
In the Philippines, but it Is the kind of
service that pets but little recognition.
The principal work was the establishment
and maintenance of lines of communica
tion, and in pressing forward with their
wires they were more than once out in :
front of the tiring line. Being there to I
work under tire and not to fight back, :
they received but little mention in the
dispatches over the very wires they had i
laid and were keeping in order. To their
work is due the fact that all through the
campaign commanding generals have
been able to keep in constant communi
cation with their troops, and to keep in
formed of the smallest happenings as far
out as the outposts. During the opera- â¢

Ing at the City Hall putting in a heavy day's work fanning himself, when
under ordinary conditions he could have dozed along without the fanning. An
other one was made weary looking at the boy whom he commissioned to bring
him iced drinks.
County Assessor Dalton found his avoirdupois such a burden to him that he
applied to the Supervisors this morning for an indefinite leave of absence, which
was cheerfully granted.
Street Superintendent Miller had no difficulty In organizing a sewer clean*
ing gang, for nearly everybody in his department was anxious to get down
in the cool sewers, even with the rats and other things thrown in.
And as for the tramp along the county roadâ the heat forced him to work.
Instead of sitting in the shadow of a hedge he was forced to walk under the

tions of the fleet these men established
flag stations on hills, on the tops of
houses and in church towers, and noting
the fail of the shells signaled the ves
sels the accuracy of their (ire, Its Sects
and the ranges. They worked in squads,
one corps being scattered from one end
of the firing line to the other, and every
man had to be an expert. Their work
was not of the gunpowder and clash of
battle order; it was silent and persist
ent, and like the secret service, Its great
est and almost only reward is the con
sciousness of duty well and honorably
performed.
The corps to be mustered out is to be
made up of men from almost every regi
ment thai was in service in the islands.
There are quite a number from this city
and Oakland and from this State. They
are all men of Intelligence and aptitude
and as a consequence the corps is above
the average of other branches of the ser
vice. They may be known by the black
trouser strap and chevron and by the
crossed flags and torches which all the
men carry on their arms.
The Forty-sixth Infantry has been or
dered to start for this city on October
16. It is now rendezvousing at South
Farmington, Mass. This is the first of
the second series of regiments under the
new call to be ordered out here. The
others are rapidly being recruited up to
their complement. Four of them will
reach Manila by way of the East and
the Suez canal on the transports Thomas,
Logan and Meade. The other nine will
be sent 'rom here. It was expected by
that they would only pause here for a
day or two and then go on to .Manila, but
they will not get away so easily. Gen
eral Shatter's policy has been to keep
the regiments here for two weeks, any
way, on a sort of sanitary probation, and
then to iet them go on. The wisdom of
this is shown by the Thirty-first, rfow in
quarantine on Angel Island. It was just
the day before lt was scheduled to sail
that the smallpox broke out in Its ranks.
It would be hard to imagine what would
have happened had the regiment got
away carrying the germs of the disease
with it. Smallpox on a ship loaded with
eighteen hundred men would be some
thing horrible.
Second Lieutenant Alfred M. Wilson.
Twentieth Infantry, has been assigned
to the transport Manauense as commis
sary and quartermaster.
Captain James J. Mayes. First Lieuten
ants Hamilton Bowie and C. C. Pulls
and Second Lieutenant Joseph C. Right
er, all of the Fortieth Infantry, have been
ordered to report to their regimental

officers have all been attached to t..e

recruited at the Presidio.
CHILD RUN OVER.
ALAMEDA. Oct. 9.â The little daughter
of Mrs. Fores of 2066 Encinal avenue was
painfully injured this afternoon while out
bicycle riding on Park street, near Central
avenue, by being run down by a horse and
spring wagon, driven by William Presby
'â !' Bay Farm Island.
One wheel of the vehicle passed over
the lit tie girl's head and her scalp was
badly lacerated. Presby was placed un
der arrest pending further investigation
of the affair. He claims that the trouble
was caused by the little girl attempting
to pass between his wagon and the curb
on the wrong side. She struck the horse
first, and In such a manner as to throw
her under .me of the front wheels of the
wagon, and before the horse could be
brought to a stop the wheel had passed
over the little one's bead. The injured
Kirl was carried into Binder's drugstore
and her wounds were dressed by Dr.
Keyes. She was afterward taken to her
home.

MERCED ELOPERS
MARRIED AT OAKLAND
OAKLAND, Oct Once again Oakland
has proven a haven for elopers. The latest
is the sensational elopement of Mrs.
George Winters of Merced with Bert Mil
ton Clift, a barber of the same place,
which culminated in a marriage ceremony,
at which Rev. A. Jatho, pastor of St.
Marcus Evangelical Lutheran Church in
this City, officiated, last Saturday night.
The couple left Merced last week, tak
ing with them the woman's 3-year-old .-on,
and on Saturday night about 9 o'clock
they called at the residence of Rev. Mr.
Jatho in this city. The minister, how
ever, was out at the time. To the lady
who answered the bell the couple stated
that they had called at several ministers
homes, but had been unable to find a
pastor home to marry them. It has since
been learned that the couple had also
called on the priest in charge of St. Jo
seph's Church, on Chestnut street. The
priest, however, seemed somewhat
alarmed and refused to solemnize the
union, noting that they seemed to be in a
great hurry. He told them that all did
not appear right to his mind, and so he
referred them elsewhere. Hence it was
shortly before midnight that ''lift with
his eloping bride and her little ion again
returned to Rev. Mr. Jatho's home, where
the nuptial knot was tied in the presence
of Mrs. Scott and Mrs. Helen Fogarty,
a neighbor, as witnesses.
â¢ 'lift gave his age as 26 years and that
of the woman, who was named in the
marriage license as Miss Susie Drannon,
as -.: years, and their residence as San
Francisco. The 3-year-old hoy who ac
companied them they referred to as the
child of a friend. The trio took the last
train for San Francisco.
George Winters, the deserted husband, is
understood to be closing out his business
interests in the La Grand Hotel at Merced
and rumor has it that he is but preparing
to go on the trail of the guilty and seem
ingly bigamous lovers. It Is stated that
Clift's young brother also last week tried
to elope with a pretty Merced girl named
Laura Appling, but his plans were
frustrated.
Both Winters and Cliff are known to
lie quite handy with guns, and it is feared
that should they meet serious trouble
will surely follow.

Mrs. Cotterell Has a
Fight on Hand. .'
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Oct. 9.
Mrs. L. M. Cotterell has closed all the
doors and windows at 10-7 Oak street, and
defies the officers or representatives of the
Union Savings Bank to put her out. Last
year the bank took the property under l
foreclosure, and has also brought suit to
dispossess Mrs. Cotterell, which is set for
trial before Judge Greene next Friday. !
Mrs. Cotterell entered the house Janu
ary 1 as a tenant at will of the bank, and
when the bank demanded that she surren
; der the house she refused. Three weeks
j ago another demand was made, and it had
I to be thrust through a barricaded window,
1 as Mrs. Cotterell refused admission to the |
' officer. She has filed an answer and J
counter claim to the bank's suit, asserting
that in December of last- year William G.
Shaw employed her as housekeeper
and caretaker of the property in dispute.
She says she has demanded pay for her J
services but was put off by a statement
that nothing would be done until the bank
had disposed of the property. She de
mands $504 as pay to December 30. In the
meantime Mrs. Cotterell keeps within the
mansion, refusing an entrance to the
bank's agents or to any officer of the
court. She has been served through a |
window with a notice that the trial is set j
for Thursday next. *
Ex-Soldier's Strange Malady.
OAKLAND, Oct. 9.â The physicians at
the Receiving Hospital are nonplused
over the case of James Harvey, a soldier,
who for over five hours this afternoon
stood motionless near the corner of
Broadway and Fourth street, his head
thrown back, the pupils of his eyes di
lated and his muscles contracted. Early
this evening his muscles relaxed, but. he
was wholly unable to give any account
of himself and appeared demented. From
papers found in his possession it was
learned that he was recently discharged
from the Twenty-third United States In
fantry. He is 29 years of age and will be
examined for insanity to-morrow.
BORN AND DIED IN
THE PATROL WAGON
OAKLAND, Oct. 9.â Mrs. Ollie Bayley,
aged 19 years, became very suddenly ill
In East Oakland to-day and while she
was being conveyed to the Receiving
Hospital in the police patrol a child was
born to her. The Intar.t died immediate
ly from exposure. Mrs. Bayley stated
that her husband had left her last April
to go to Kansas City. Mo. She has been
supporting herself by working out as a
domestic and gives her residence as 473
Sixth street.
England has about 150 packs of fox
hounds and about 15,000 horses are kept
specially for fox-hunting.

This contest Is proving much more stubborn

Many a woman dresses to 20 out, Â£ee_t
irresolute, sits down, and falls into a fit
of despondent musing. Ask her what's
the matter, and she'll probably answer
"Just the blues." And what are the
blues? Only another name, in g_-___
for a disordered liver and a diseased
stomach. Cleanse the liver, heal the
stomach, purify the blood, and there'll
be no more blues. It can be done by
the use of Dr. Pierces Golden Medical
Discovery. This medicine puts the dis-
eased organs of digestion and nutzitiroc
into a condition of sound health. It
eliminates from the blood all impure and
poisonous substances, and cleanses file
clogged liver. It contains neither al-
cohol nor narcotics.
"I had liver complaint for the pest fifteen
years, complicated with dyspepsia and nil
stone*," writes Mrs. N. Bernier, of 461 Eâ SL,
Oshkosh, Wis. "I doctored with seven of oar
prominent doctors, and not one or all of them
have done me the good, nor begun to do hat
your medicines have. I have used three tactics
of Dr. Pierce's- Golden Medical Disc*â cry, one

Dr. Pierces Favorite Prescription, and have

dences of joy. As soon as Dr. Klnyoun
finished inspecting the big; transport the
welcome party climbed up the ship's lad
der and boarded the transport. Governor
Rogers, who led the party, was met at 1
the gangway by Colonel Wholley.
"Governor, I've brought back your reg- j
iment," said the gallant Colonel, as he
grasped the Governor by the hand. Gov- j
ernor Rogers responded with a compli- â¢
mentary tribute to the excellent services
the Washington troops performed in the
Philippines, and then he went down on the
lower decks and shook hands with nearly
every man In the regiment.
Levy Ankeny, the Walla Walla million
aire, who generously offered to pay for
the transportation of the entire regiment !
from this city to their homes, went aboard
with his wife to see their son, who is a
private in Company L, and when the men
learned of Ankeny's. generosity they j
cheered him to the echo.
The. troops were out on the firing line j
when the orders came for them to pack I
up and get ready for their long journey 1
home. They had to make unusual haste, '
as the Pennsylvania was scheduled to sail
the next morning. In their hurry to get
aboard many of the soldiers left behind
valuable trinkets and curios, which they j
had been collecting ever since they set .
foot on Philippine soil. At Nagasaki and
Yokohama the boys were given extended
shore leave, and they enjoyed themselves
sightseeing for two days.
The trip across the Pacific was an un- j
usually rough one. The transport encoun- |
tered severe, storms a few days after leav- j
ing Yokohama, which made matters ex- j
tremely unpleasant for everybody aboard. j
No deaths occurred during the voyage,
and only a few of the boys were 111.
While the troops were at Yokohama 1

j In addition to the Washington troops !
the transport brought back eighty dis- |
charged soldiers from the Fourth Cavalry j
and Fourteenth Infantry. Major Seaton j

He returns to be retired. Lieutenant
! Hinesof the United States cable boat ,
Hooker, which was wrecked off Corregldor
i Island, and sixteen of the crew of the !

The regiment will -probably be marched j
j to the Presidio this morning. Lieutenants 1
I Lamping and Lemon have been detailed 1
! to take charge of the transport until the j

The Washington regiment was on the '
firing line continually from February 5 to 1
; September L
"I am proud of the record made by our \

INNOCENT MAN CHARGED
WITH A BOLD ROBBERY
Blundering Methods of Chief
Lees and His Sleuths.
Harry McVeay, a Hard-Working Young
Man, Unjustly Accused of Stealing Four
Thousand Dollars From a Buggy, i
CONFINED In the "tanks" In the
City Prison and denied even the
right to consult an attorney, is
Harry McVeay, a hard-working
young man. Anxious to swell their
records as blundering thief-catchers De
tective Crockett, who is better known as
"Old Ironsides," and Sergeant Ellis,
whose only claim to police distinction is
that he located an unwashed shirt belong
ing to Plunger Howard, the fugitive em
bezzler, arrested McVeay as being the
bold robber who stole a sack of coin con
taining $4000 from the buggy of Captair
Barneson last Saturday afternoon. He
ANARCHIST'S SUICIDE
AT THE ROPE'S END
M. LEVITZKY, LATE OF CHI
CAGO, MADE THE LEAP.
Believed That Property Is Robbery
and Not Having It Hanged
Himself in His Clothes
Closet.
M. Levitzky committed suicide some
time last Sunday night by hanging him
self to a hook in the clothes closet of his
room in the residence of Thomas Elston,
418 Franklin street.
His dead body was found at 12:30 o'clock
yesterday afternoon. After fastening the
rope around his neck he stood en a chair
and kicked the chair away.. The force of
the fall caused the rope to cut his neck.
Levltzky was about 32 years old and
came to this city from Chicago about a
year ago. He had worked for a time as
fitter and designer of ladies' cloaks at
131 Post street, and had been sick and
despondent recently. He had no relatives :
in the city so far as known. Books and
pamphlets found among his effects by
Deputy Coroner Sullivan and Messenger
Flannigan tend to prove that the deceased
was or had been a member of or sympa
thizer with the Chicago anarchists. The
pamphlets proclaim Proudhon's doctrine |
that all property is robbery, hold up the
gloomy side of life to the wage slave and ,
decry against that condition of things i
which allows one man to drink cham
pagne and eat roast turkey when he has
earned them and will not allow the other
man who has not earned them to eat and !
drink them likewise.
It is believed that Levitzky's mind was
unsettled by this misleading literature,
and placed in such a morbid condition
that he saw no way out of his troubles
than suicide.
He left a note written in Hebrew script
and in the Polish language, but up to a
late hour last night neither Coroner Hill
nor Deputy Coroner Sullivan could suc
ceed in translating it. :
NEWPORT ARRIVES.
Regulars and Discharged Sol-
diers Pass in During
the Night.
The transport Newport j arrived In port
late last night with discharged soldiers of
the Third Artillery, Fourteenth Infantry
and the Fourth Cavalry. All told she
carried over 400 men, all burning with
anxiety to reach their native land after
the hardships of campaigning in the Phil
ippine Islands. The Eighteenth Company
Signal Corps was also on board, and the
members are for the most part Califor
nians who volunteered for Manila service.
Five men died of dysentery on the. trip
from Nagasaki. The unfortunate soldiers
who succumbed to . disease on the trip
were: Sergeant Major Young of ' the
Twenty-second Infantry, Private Walsh
of the Fourteenth Infantry, Private Han
cock of the Third Aatlllery. Private Shar
key of the Ninth Infantry, and an un
known discharged soldier.
In the port of Nagasaki a row broke out
that nearly culminated In a riot. Tho
captain of the ship became involved in a
merry war with the soldiers over the ob
streperous conduct of a Japanese sailor
who took It upon himself to insult a blue
jacket. The American Consul at Naga
saki boarded the ship to settle matters
judicially, but the soldier was allowed to
return to his native country.
The usual tale of ill-treatment on the
part of the officers of the ship was forth
coming on the part of the discharged sol
diers, but they all look well and in good
health. . . .
THE Mc AULIFEE MURDER.
Frank J. Mitchell Instructed as to
His Rights by Judge Mogan.
Frank J. Mitchell, who shot and killed
Frank McAuliffe on Sunday night during
a row over a grocery bill, . appeared in
Judge Mogan's court yesterday and was
Instructed- as to his rights. He was rep
resented by Reel B. Terry. By consent
the case was continued till next Monday,
pending the result of the Coroner's in
quest.
Mitchell still contends that ;he was
forced to shoot in self-defense, and that
will be his plea. He. was always known
to be a quiet, inoffensive young man. so
his friends say. This is the third member
of the McAulifTe family that has met
with a violent death. Edward was shot
and killed at Mussel Slough several years
ago during the fight between the settlers
and the Southern Pacific, and Eugene,
another brother, was drowned.
Independent Social.
Next Saturday night the Independent
Social Club will give a social In the so
cial hall of the Foresters' building at 102
O'Farrell street. /â¢:'?-â :;:' .-^,-;.Â» Â' "- ;."

was at once taken to police headquarters
and immured in the "tanks," "pending
further developments," us Ellis aptly
put it.
Yesterday It was conclusively shown
thai McVeay had nothing to do with the
robbery. Captain of Detectives Bohen ls
satisfied of his Innocence, but for some
unexplained reason the unfortunate vic
tim of police intolerance is doomed to re
main in prison until Chief I_ees and his
pair of incompetent sleuths give him his
release.
contrary to the statement of Ellis and '
Crockett Mrs. Richards, who conducts j
the lodging-house at 132 Sixth street
where McVeav roomed, has not identified I
the young man as being the person she
saw entering her house with the stolen j
sack of coin under his coat.
"I am convinced that he is not the i
man,' remarked Mrs. Richards yester- i
day when shown McVeay. "The person '
I saw entering my house with a sack of
coin under his coat was shorter and of
an entirely different cast of counten- i
ance."
Both Ellis and Crockett vainly endeav
ored to get her to identify McVeay, but
she adhered to her original statement and
persistently refused to be bulldozed into
| saying that the prisoner was the man
| she had seen. A responsible citizen,
! whose name the police refused to divulge,
! and who witnessed the robbery, has also
failed to identify McVeay, much to the
! disgust of the blundering sleuths. He
: was taken to the City Prison yesterday
and confronted by McVeay. After care
| fully scrutinizing him he emphatically de
' clared that he was not the thief.
Mrs. Dray, who is employed as a re
| toucher in a photograph gallery on
Brook street, between Kearny street and
Grant avenue, is the only witness the po-
I lice have found who in any way has iden
, tified McVeay. She says she was looking
| out of the window of the photograph
' gallery reading The call's bulletins on
the International yacht race when she
: saw a man answering the description of :
. the prisoner crawl Into Barneson's buggy
and "lift" the sack of coin. While ad
. mitting she was excited at the time, she
seems inclined to believe that McVeay is
the culprit.
McVeav Is a hard-working fellow and
enjoys the confidence of his employers
Unless Chief Lees sees fit to charge' him
to-day his friends intend to sue out a
writ of habeas corpus for his release.
BANKER MURDOCH IS
ILL WITH SMALLPOX
REMOVED TO THE PESTHOUSE
FOR TREATMENT.
Thought to Have Contracted the
Malady Handling Soldiers'
Money at the Bank.
Robert B. Murdoch, cashier of the Bank
of Commerce, was removed from his
home at 723 Devlsadero street yesterday
afternoon to the Pesthouse. where he is
suffering from smallpox. Murdoch is one
of the best-known business men of this
city and his sudden sickness has created
consternation in business circles. The
health officials have tried to trace his
case to the point of infection, and al
though not positive in their findings have
concluded that he contracted the malady
through handling currency and exchange
handed in at his hank by soldiers re
turned from the Philippines.
Murdoch has been ailing for several
days past, but did not discover his seri
ous condition until yesterday, when he
thought it necessary to call in his fam
ily physician. His physician promptly
diagnosed the case as smallpox and Mur
doch himself ordered the fact at once
reported to the health authorities
Every comfort will be given him and
everything done that can be toward his
rapid recovery and the physicians are
hopeful of his case.
SETTLERS PROTECTED
ON RAILROAD LANDS
United States Circuit Court of Ap
peals Declares Them Innocent
Purchasers.
Judges Gilbert. Ross and Morrow of the
United States Circuit Court of Appeals
handed down two decisions yesterday.
The first was written by Judge Morrow
and affirmed the decree of the lower court
in the case of the United States of Amer
ica vs. the Southern Pacific Railroad
Company and others.
The suit was brought to quiet title to
700.000 acres within the limits of the for
feited grant to the Atlantic and Pacific
Rairoad Company and others, the other
defendants alleging that they were bona
fide purchasers of said lands for value
from the Southern Pacific Railroad Com
pany and its grantees. These defendants
had purchased In good faith 1"7 000
acres of the forfeited grant, and the de
cree of the United States Circuit Court
j for the Southern District of California,
j after adjudging that the United States
I was the owner by title and in fee simple
] and absolute of the lands, provided that
the decree should not in any wise affect
: any right which the defendants other
j than the Southern Pacific Railroad Com
pany now have or may hereafter ac
j quire.
The United States appealed on the

BURGLARS AT WORK.
The police at the North End station
were notified on Sunday, night by one of
the neighbors that the residence of Irvine
Cooper, 3511 Jackson street, had been en
tered by burglars. Policemen Harrington
and Francis were detailed to investigate
and they found that entrance had been
effected by forcing open two of the rear
windows with "jimmies." The front bed
room had been ransacked and the -con
tents of a jewelry box stolen. A door
leading into the servants' room had been
forced open and the burglars had appar
ently become alarmed, as a watch and a
pair of opera glasses on top of the bureau
had not been taken.
The family is in Redwood City at pres
ent and the loss will not be known until
some of them return. There have been
several burglaries in that locality re

NORTHWEST TO
JOIN THE FIGHT
TO HOLD TRADE
â¦
Good News Comes
From Two States.
â¦
Portland. Seattle and Tacoma will stand
with the cities of California to make the
fight against the St. Louis and Chicago
jobbers who are seeking to get the Pacific
Coast trade. This is made certain by the
reports brought back by the representa-
tives of leading lines of business in Cali-
fornia who visited the northwest to secure
concerted action.
The northwestern cities have already
j organized locally. They have agreed to
i elect members to the excutive committee
of the Pacific Coast Traffic Association to
represent them, which will effect a union
of business interests. There will be but ;
one organization on the slope, with head- ;
quarters in this city. This is what the j
committee reports, in substance. A united
front will therefore represent the coast
before the Interstate Commerce Commis-
sioners.
"There is no doubt that Tacoma, Seat- j
I tle and Portland will co-operate with us." :
I said Charles F. Tay to a Call reporter !
yesterday. This statement was indorsed â 
by other members of the committee.
When San Francisco's representatives
reached Portland they found that prom-
inent Portland business men had started
j for Seattle to organize. They succeeded,
â  and the Jobbers' and Manufacturers' As-
sociation was formed in Seattle, with an
executive committee of three. This hav-
ing been accomplished, co-operation was
secured in Tacoma. The Portland Cham-
ber of- Commerce met and approved unan- ;
imously the action of the Seattle confer- i
ence. Henry Halm, who Interviewed the
Portland merchants, in speaking of the j
situation said:
"It is needless to say that the new as-
sociation is a step in the right direction.
This is a broad undertaking, and it should
be viewed from a broad standpoint. It is
not a move In the interest of San Fran- [
cisco or Seattle, but in the interest of the |
entire Pacific Coast. We must unite for
our own protection, or the Middle West
jobber will drive us out of business."
The collectors of funds in this city are
busy. An open letter has been addressed
to business men in which occurs the fol-
lowing statement: "The suit is really
brought against you. The wholesalers,
jobbers and many manufacturers of the j
coast must become parties to the suit and
defend their rights."
FIRE THREATENS THE
TOWN OF MOJAVE
Fierce Flames Destroying Important
Buildings and All Wires Are
\ Down.
MOJAVE, Oct. 9.â Fire broke out here
to-night at 8:40 o'clock and threatens to
destroy the town. A heavy wind is blow-
ing, and although every effort is being
made to subdue the fierce flames it looks
as If the town will be reduced to ashes.
Further information was cut off by the
breaking of the wires leading out of the
town.
Mojave is a village in Kern County and
is 60 miles from Los Angeles. It has a
population of 1500. It Is situated on
the northern border of the desert whose
name it bears. It is a small but thriving
railroad town, dependent largely upon the
shops of the Southern Pacific Railroad
j and Atlantic and Pacific road. It is the
I terminal point on the Pacific Coast of
j the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad, which
I branches off at Barstow, and for seventy-
i two miles brings the traveler through the
I desert on his way to San Francisco.
Mojave is the nearest railroad point for
I the extensive borax works in the East,
and is also the point of departure for the
j mining camps of Ooler and Red Rock.
j There are two Important borax mines
: with headquarters there, and it is a
I â¢shipping point for mining for adjacent
j towns and for Inyo County as far as
Independence.

NEARLY THROWN OVERBOARD.
Experience of Attorney Curtis While
Trying to Collect a Fee on
the lowa.
Albert Derten, a sailor, appeared before
Judge Mogan yesterday morning on a
charge of stealing $24 from Karl Tiedeman,
who was a sailor on the Oregon. Tiede-
man befriended Derten, and that was
how he showed his gratitude.
Derten engaged Attorney Curtis, a re-
cent arrival from New York, to defend
him, and gave him an order on the pay-
master of the lowa for his fee. Curtis
told the Judge yesterday that Derten was
not a sailor on the lowa and he was near-
