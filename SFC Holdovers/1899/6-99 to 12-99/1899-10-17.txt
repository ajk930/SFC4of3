|^SNj lumbia! Victory is hers. Nine
! A minutes and forty-seven seconds
[I, Jj, ahead of the challenger, at th.c
outer mark, and ten minutes and
fourteen seconds In the lead at
the finish. There is the record for the
first rareâ that old. almost obsolete one
of fifteen miles to windward or to lee
ward, which had seemed as though it
wculd never be run.
But with the mist and fog of to-day [
there came a fair racing wind, and on Its
heels rode some surprises. With th. gray
drizzle swirling through her canvas the
Columbia, the much abused and somewhat
discredited' defender, owed that despite
all criticism she is still worthy of all con
fidence and of all praise. And she showed
it from the moment the starting gun was
fired, and from the time when the two
racers swept over the lineâ the Shamrock
having then a slight lead over her rivalâ
tr , reP seconds the judges counted.
instead of another languid drive before
failing winds, this contest began with a
lively beat against a freshening easterly
breeze. The mainsail, club topsail, .lib.
baby jib and staysail the Shamrock was
wearing as she went spinning across the
line and away in tbe southwest, where
fifteen miles away, the outer mark was
anchored. Gaily cutting her way through
the waters, she seemed conscious that if
Fhe were not to win, at least she was
not to be eaten, so often had she man
aged to show her heels to the Herreshoff
racer, or to quit on even or very nearly
even terms with the boat on occasions
â¢when the races were declared off. .
With wet bows swinging and reeling and
occasional splashes of spray over her
deck, the Columbia went driving .in pur
suit of the flying leader. The one seemed
saucy, careless even: the other bent on
winning. Observers had not had too great
cause for admiring the set of the Co
lumbia's sails, but all marveled at the
superb fit of her canvas. Nor was there
any lifting of leaches or any other indi
cation to show thai the Herreshofl boat
was paring the wind too fine. Instead,
every fitltch seemed to be doing all the
work of which 11 was capable, and the
foam swishing away from the bow told.
how well that was done. Abeam of the
Shamrock drew the Columbia, and then
daylight, such as it was. showed between
them. That was within less than two
minutes of the start. Fool fast and
pointing high the Columbia opened the
pap stll! wider, and steadily, surely, drew
farther and farther in the lead.
The Shamrock seemed then to realize
that this was to bo no day of fooling if
the cup wore to be won, and trimm.ng
her sheets flat aft she endeavored to tie
close to that easterlng wind. Hut In spite
of all her ardent efforts to hug still closer
that breeze from her native isle the Co
lumbia continued to outpoint and to out-
foot the Irish yacht.
The day was dismal, -with its fop and
drizzle, and bo thick was the weather at
times that both yachts were almos. nid
den from view. The big Plant l'i.e
steamship Grand Duchesse. from which
Marconi was sending his wireless teleg
*vr.aphy report to the Herald and '' he Call,'
rode within one mile of the racers, but
often vapor boiled up in banks so thick
that it was difficult to discern the yachts.
The San Francisco Call
At times one would show like a fai/.t
blur In the thickness, while the other
would look like a patch or' .whiter fog.
But it was for brief Intervals only that
the yachts were veiled from observers. on
the Grand Duchesse. And every time the
vapor thinned and a clear view was had
of th.c racers a shout of acclaim would
go up from the decks of the big steam
ship, tor it was plainly seen that the â 
American boat was not only maintaining
the lead which she had gained, but was
steadily increasing it.
The wind had freshened to good twelve
miles an hour and to a racing yacht '
showing as much canvas as the Columbia
exposed, that certainly seemed enough to
give. her a sharp heel. Upright as the just ;
the Columbia sped along, pointing in t.,e j
wind and plainly outfooting the slippery!
Irish cutter. Then came an effort at
jockeying on the part of Captains Ho
garth and Wrings In a futile effort to out- 1
do the Columbia by maneuvering. They i
failed signally.
The Columbia was under the same rig j
as was the Shamrock and to many ciose j
observers it seemed that she was handled j
even better. One thing was patent to all]
who looked, and that was that Captain
Barr did not mean for the Shamrock to j
get away from him. Thus, when the,

headway before she swung around to the
port tack. The next moment the Colum
bia's head .sails were shivering and
around to the same tack she went. Back
to the old tack went the Shamrock and
pitiless as fate the Columbia followed.
Within the next ten minutes the Sham
rock tacked half a dozen times, but she
could no more shake off the Columbia
than she could her shadow. Every time
she came about the Columbia came about
also, and finally -convinced that there was
nothing to be gained by that sort of work.
she gave up jockeying and bent all her en
ergy to overcoming that big lead which
the Columbia had gained. But plain sail
ing helped the Shamrock no more than did
the jockeying which she had vainly at
tempted.
Opinion as to the merits of these two
boats had been much divided by their per
formances during the indecisive tests of
last week and the week before. Some were
of the opinion that the Shamrock would
show better when reaching against a brisk
wind than the Herreshoff boat. Others held
a different view, and these are now con
vinced that the Shamrock is no match for
the Columbia when going against the
wind. In the language of a devotee who
went down to the . races on board the
Grand Duchesse, the Yankee cutter "made
a show of the Shamrock." That yacht was
almost lost in the hazÂ« astern when the
excursion fleet took up its position off the
outer mark and .waited the outcome of
that beat against the wind. The question
was not then which boat would round it

OPERATIONS OF
THE INVADING BOERS
LONDON, Oct. 16.â Dispatches from the
Cape are very meager to-night, but they
Include an important message from Glen
coe Camp, dated 3:35 this (Monday) after
noon, announcing that the Boer comman
dos, which Invaded Natal through Laings
Neck and, after occupying Newcastle, ad
vanced to Pannhauser, retired on Ingag
ene yesterday evening, their transport ser
vice being reported defective. This will
delay indefinitely the anticipated and
hoped for assault on the strong British
position at Glencoe.
Another dispatch reports activity on the
part of the Free State commando in the
neighborhood of Allwalnorth, on the
southern frontier. The Boers' advance
patrol, the dispatch says, go to the fron
tier bridge nightly to keep watch, firing
shots at intervals as signals. It Is believed
the enemy intends shortly to try to rush
the railway station, with the help' of ar
tillery posted on a ridge commanding the
town.
There are rumors that the Boers have
been repulsed at Mafeking and are at
tacking Vryburg.
A Cape Town paper has a dispatch from
the Orange River stating that the tele

graph wires have been cut between Vry
burg and Kimberley ar.d It Is believed that
the Boers are taking advantage of the
presence of a large gathering of disloyal
farmers at Vryburg celebrating Nacht
maal to attack the town, hoping the farm
ers will assist them against the British.
The same dispatch says that the British
force at Kimberley Is confident of its
ability to hold out, but advises the dis
patch of a relief force. This question of a
possible rising of the Dutch farmers in the
northern portions of Cape Colony is very
important.
The Daily Mail's correspondent at Coles
burg has been inquiring regarding the
matter and on the whole thinks the
chances are against a rising. He bases
his opinion on the'prospect of good crops
after four lean years, which he believes
will predispose the farmers to peace. Nev
ertheless there is serious distrust and
much anti-British agitation in these dis
tricts, while the Free State Boers threaten
an immediate invasion of Colesburg and
Allwalnorth.
The Daily Mail's correspondent asserts
that Sir Alfred Mllner is worked to death
and that Cape Town is surging with bit
ter resentment at what is called the
Schreiner cabinet's betrayal of Mafeking
by its constant refusal to send a force of
volunteer artillery thither. Many . resi
dents of Cape Town have relatives at
Vryburg, and they are furious with
Merriem and Souer, respectively colonial
treasurer and commissioner of public
works, and the Ministers are mobbed
whenever they appear in public. Mr.
Hoffmeyer, the Afrikander leader, has
gone to the country In order to escape the
outburst of Indignation. On Sunday night
the streets were filled with angry citizens,
and it was feared that rioting would oc
cur. This, combined with the pressure
of the Imperial Government, brought the
Schreiner government to a sense of its
peril as well as of Its duty and moved
it to decide to call out the volunteers.
The Ministerial party also worked Its
hardest to prevent the ovation to Conyng
ham Greene on his arrival from Pretoria,
but failed. The volunteers are "000 strong
and have eleven pieces of artillery.

ized several thousand natives who were
tramping from the Rand to drive their
heavy guns up Laings Neck.
Precautions are being taken for the de
fense of Pietermaritzburg and Durban, in
the remote contingency that the enemy
may elude the vigilance of the British at
Ladysmith and Glencoe camps.
A dispatch from the latter place says
the partial closing down of the Natal
commercial lines will not interrupt the
supplies for the imperial transports at
Durban, as is imagined by the Boers,
large quantities of coal being already on
the way there from India. Regular ship
ments will arrive from India until the
Natal mines open again.
The Cape Town correspondent of the
Times says he learns on the highest au
thority that there is no truth in the
statement â¢ being circulatedâ doubtless
with seditious motivesâ that the imperial
Government has decided to place small
bodies of troops in the country district.
Martial law, he says, has been proclaimed
at Mafeking. Vryburg, Taungs, Herbert
and Barkley West.
Dispatches from Dundee say that ac
cording to the report of refugees the Boer
invaders of Natal are estimated at 16,
--000. All the non-combatants and women
and children have been sent from Dun
dee. The news that the Boers had ar
rived at Dannhauser raised hopes that
they would risk an engagement In he

detachment which reached there was only
a small advance body of Commandant
General Joubert's main column. The ad
vance of the Boers was accompanied by
some looting of stores at Newcastle and

The refugees assert that Commandant
Viljoen's command contains a surprising
number of Hollanders, Germans and Eng
lishmen.

All of last week the yellow kid hung

he called the great Italian inventor, when
that yacht race was sailed. He behaved
like the little hoodlum that he is. He re

He handled these falsehoods with such

first, but by what margin the Columbia
would do It. Right grano.iv she swept to
ward the turning point, her sails showing
faint and shadowy in the mist that was
then veiling the ocean, and as the mark
came slipping by her port bow and beam
every whistle from every steamship was
let loose in loud acclaim of the victory
which the American yacht had won.
There were many of the Columbia's en
thusiasts on board the Grand Duchesse,
and there was an impromptu war dance
when the American yacht, after rounding
the mark, dropped her spinnaker boom to
port and swinging her main boom to star
board, -broke out the spinnaker and bal
loon jib and under that great cloud of can
vas started on the homeward run. a lace
work of foam aoout her bow and seas
brimming under her counter and along her
rail. The graceful undulations see..., to
be ore marked as she drew abeam of the
laggard ShamrocK still reaching for the
outer mark. Dropping a courtesy to her
rival, one so pronounced that it almost
dipped her bellying balloon jib aback, the
Yankee cutter then flirted her heels at the
Shamrock and sped into a bank of mist
which came rolling by just then as If to
shield the other's defeat.
To those who wen eager to follow the
Columbia in her run back to the light
ship, the wait for the Sham
rock to round the outer mark seemed a
long and tiresome one. The Columbia
had vanished In a drift of vapor and to
the excursionists it seemed as though the
Shamrock would never get to the mark
or around it. Eager they all were to fol
low the American boat Jn her homeward
flight, for never was a finer picture pre
sented than that she showed as she drove
into that bank of mist, her sails looking
ghostlike as they faded into Indistinctness
and finally disappeared. It was all imagi
nation, of course, but it looked to the
watchers as though some of the lead
colored atmosphere, some of the weight
of that dense fog, had got into the Sham
rock's keel. Slowly she drew toward the
bobbing mark, and a bit sluggishly, half
heartedly it seemed, she rounded it, and
then with booms -swing and bellying
spinnaker and balloon jib added to her
other sails, took up the trail of the van
ished leader. That she had many admir
ers in the excursion fleet, or that the ex
cursionists felt magnanimity toward the
vanquished, was shown by the noisy,
long-drawn-out whistles which greeted
the somewhat delayed performance of
getting around the tutnfng mark.
Long before the leading yacht had
reached the finish line lt was a foregone
conclusion that the victory was the Co
lumbia's. Even the most extreme of the
Shamrock's advocates admitted that, and
none of those hesitated to say thai the
reason of It was that the Shamrock had
been outsailed.
The Irish boat was hopelessly beaten in
work to windward, beaten so badly that
even her most optimistic followers had
little or no hope of her being able to over
come the lead which the Columbia gained
on the first leg. There were some who
for a few minutes held to the belief that
the Shamrock might overcome that ad
vantage on the homeward run, but these
did not hold that view long. And. still
fewer, if any there were, who believed
that the Shamrock would be so cleanly, so
overwhelmingly defeated as she was In
to-day's struggle. Despite the weather
conditions it was magnificent and to the
few who saw it, it made up for the re
peated disappointments of the past. The
excursion crowd was a small one, for the
day was anything but promising, and
there had been so many failures in the
past that comparatively few took chances

meant by this, read a few samples of the

TECHNICAL STORY
OF COLUMBIA'S
GREaT VICTORY
: NEW YORK, Oct. 16.â The crews of both
yachts had breakfast early and when they
"turned to" soon after 8 o'clock it was
with a will, for, in spite of the rather
hazy weather, there was a good breeze
from the eastward, which promised to in
crease and give the yachts a good race at
last. Jibs and staysails were sent up in
stops on the stays, racing hatches put
i on, boats lashed and everything made
snug before 9 o'clock. At 9:15 the Co
lumbia cast oft from her moorings and
was taken in tow by a tug. The Sham
rock started In tow a few minutes later.
; Covers were on the mainsails and club
topsails to keep them dry until the last
; moment, as there was just enough fine
} rain to dampen them.
\ At 10 o'clock both yachts had reached
! the east end of Gedney's channel and at
j 10:10 the Columbia's crew began hoisting
; the mainsail. It was set in five minutes.
! The Shamrock's mainsail began to go up
j at the same time, but it was fully fifteen
i minutes before the sail was set.
At 10:23 both yachts cast off their tow
lines, broke out their jibs and mastheaded
: their No. 2 club topsail. The Columbia
', also sent up her baby jib topsail on the
stay. At the same time the committee
. boat Walter Duckenbach anchored due
: south of the Sandy Hook lightship and
sent up the course signal, lt was east,
â¢ making it a beat dead to windward of
1 fifteen miles and a run back if the wind
; held from the same quarter.
! The regatta committee meant business
â . this morning, for a few minutes later
. they started the tug to log off the course
'. ana at 10:45 the preparatory signal was
made. Both yachts then began maneuver
, ing for positions, and at 1u:55, when the
I warning signal was given, they were
playing for a weather berth to the north
ward of the line, the Shamrock breaking
out her staysail at this time.
When two minutes were left before the
starting signal both yachts were head
| ing, a couple of lengths apart, to the
! westward, with booms to port, the Co
j lumbia to windward. The Shamrock be

which was lying at the south end of the

with the line to nearly the center of north.
She still held her course until nearly over
to the lightship before she began to luff
to cross the line. Captain Barr, on the

her that, according to the official time

The official time of the start was

it. Then he turned and, reading !
one of his own misleading bulletins, began
prodding up Columbia so that the racers
â were neck and neck. How he had the
heart to give the Columbia the worst of it I
for half a mile is hard to explain when '
he flaunts a sign that he is "an American â¢
paper for the American people."
And so it went. Those reading The Call !
bulletins were kept fully informed of the
movements of the racers; those forced to !
depend on the yellow kid got an insight
into the old but interesting game of per- j
haps. A Marconi bulletin on The Call's j
board announced the turning of the stake- .
boat by Columbia seven minutes before
the Examiner posted that event. That
was pretty good for Marconi and pretty
bad for the yellow kid, but it was nothing j
to the finish.
At 12:55 p. m.. San Francisco time, the !
Examiner posted this bulletin:

Shamrock gaining, but Columbia
still lends by a mile. (Delayed in

Delayed in transmission! "No experi- !
ment, like wireless telegraphy," mind
you; only delayed in transmission. How !
much, do you think? Let the next two j
bulletins tell.
Less than ten seconds later The Call
threw the stars and stripes to the breeze
and posted:
Columbia Wins.
The big crowd in front of The Call
board gave one great yell and started to
separate. A number of people who all
morning had been comparing the Marconi '
messages with the "perhaps" system !
turned to the Examiner board to read
that "delayed In transmission" bulletin
announcing that the Columbia was more
than half way home.
"Gel a move on you there." some one
shouted to the yellow kid's bulletin com
missi. "What's the matter with
you?" yelled others. "Don't you know
the race is over? Columbia wins."
For four awful minutes the poor fellow !
stood tiie jibes, then he caved in. It was
too much for mortal man to stand. Some
body ran to him out of the crowd and '
spoke. Grabbing his brush, without hav
ing received any message from the yellow j
kid's other agents, he wrote "Columbia j
wins." A minute later the little yellow j
boy blew his tin whistle.

ISELIN AND UPTON TELL
HOW IT WAS DONE,
NEW YORK, Oct. 16. -When a cor
respondent visited the St. Michaels after
the race C. Oliver Iselin, with Mrs. Iselin
and a party of friends, had just arrived
from the Columbia and were gathered
aft of the little pilot house. There was
no particular sign of exultation on the
face of the managing owner of the cup
defender, though he did look extremely
well satisfied.
"I do not know," he said, "that I have
any particular comment to make. We
won to-day because we bad the better
boat. I have felt that all along. Now
othersf I think, will admit it. We tiro
ready to race to-morrow, and with a fair
wind and sea we are prepared to take our
chances with both. The boats sailed
well to-day. During the race we did not
have a hitch or accident of any sort.
Everything stood the strain in a perfect
manner."
The crew of the Columbia were board
ing the tender for supper as the cor
respondent drew away. Their enthu
siasm was a little more apparent than
that of the Iselin group, and Captain
Barr, who sat In the stern of his boat,
smiled in his own quiet way.
able to outfoot the Columbia sufficiently
to tack across her bow, a little later gave
her a good rap full. The green boat re
sponded nobly, and to some it appeared
that she was passing the Columbia very
fast. So she was, but she was losing out
ward ground every minute. When the
Shamrock tacked to port at 11:15 and the
Columbia thirty seconds later It was seen
that Barr had so placed his boat on the
weather bow of the Shamrock as to spill
the back wind into the Shamrock's sails.
Hogarth was obliged to keep broad off
about thirty seconds to get out from
under the Columbia's lee. By 11:20 the
Bristol boat was quite an eighth of a
mile to windward and outfooting and out
pointing her rival all the time.
Captain Hogarth, finding that the
Shamrock would not point as high as the
Columbia, flattened down his sheets as
hard as he dared and had to be contented
with giving her a good full and letting
her go at that. The Shamrock went about
to starboard at 11:33:30 and the Columbia
five seconds later. At 11:45:30. when the
Shamrock again tacked to port, the Colum
bia was fully a quarter of a mile to wind
ward of her. The latter tacked five sec
onds later. Captain Hogarth was getting
desperate now, and he resorted to his
short tacking tactics, in the hope that
his boat would forereach sufficiently to
make a material gain to windward. At
the conclusion of the struggle Hogarth
found himself farther to leeward than
ever, the Columbia having been, if any
thing, quicker in stays and a better fore
reacher. At 12:50:15, when the Shamrock
settle,! down again to business on the
port tack and the Columbia, after stand
ing on two minutes longer, came about to
the same tack, lt was found that the
Bristol boat was half a mile dead to
windward of her rival. In three more
tacks the Columbia still increased her
windward lead. The Shamrock people at
12:25 took in her baby jib topsail, hoping
that she might point better, but lt was in
vain, for in ten minutes they set the sail
again. It was taken in twenty minutes
later for a few minutes. Each yacht
made twelve tacks in the windward work
and in all these the Shamrock took the
Initiative. Captain Barr waited for Ho
garth to tack, and with but one or two
exceptions he put the Columbia about
within thirty seconds of the other boat.
The last half-dozen tacks made were
longer than the others. The outer mark,
which had been obscured by fog, was vis
ible to the yachts soon after 1:30. The
wind became lighter as they approached
it. but it increased a little in force as the
Columbia made her last tack. She looked
very handsome as she approached the
mark on the port before she had fairly
made the turn and as she squared away
on her homeward course the great sail
was broken out from stops. The.s ame
moment the main boom swung far off to
starboard. They were exactly eighty-five
seconds setting the spinnaker. The Sham
rock's men beat them only five seconds iv

MARCONI'S MARVELOUS
WORK IN SENDING NEWS
NEW YORK. Oct. 16.â 1t was a race in
a fog, and Signor Marconi rose to the
occasion as did the gallant Columbia.
Standing calmly at the key of his in
strument, on board the Grand Duchesse,
the inventor of the wireless telegraphy
system flashed the news of the Ameri
can victory to a waiting world, while all
other agencies were silent. The elements
themselves seemed to have conspired to
defeat the old methods of reporting yacht
races.
The course was from the Sandy Hook
lightship straight out to sea, taking the
contesting yachts many miles away from
Navesink Highlands and other observa
tion points on the Jersey shore. From
the moment the yachts left their anchor
age and moved outside the Hook, they
were lost to vision from the land. Car
rier pigeons released from the excursion
boats that followed the yachts refused to
fly through the haze and perched on
other boats. Balloons sent aloft from
tugs within view of the racers could not
be distinguished two miles away, and
they were useless signals.
With all other systems failing, Marco
ni's wonderful invention was unaffected
NEW YORK, Oct. 16.-Sir Thomas
Eipton took his defeat with the spirit of
a true sportsman. "It was a fair and
square race," said he, when Interviewed '
on board the Erin. "We wore beaten
fairly. No two boats ever stilled a better '
race and they were equally well handled, ]
as far as I could see "
Speaking of the Columbia he said: "She
is a fine, fast boat and she was splendidly
sailed. We gave her three rousing cheers
and her people responded right heartily.
Mr. iselin and those associated with him
on board are honorable gentlemen, and I
wish to say that it is a pleasure to sail ,
against such competitors."
Asked if he wished to say something ,
.about the Shamrock, Sir Thomas said:
"My beat was well sailed and the sails
were well handled. I have no complaint
to make at all. As I said lief,, re. it was a
square race and we were fairly beaten. j
We shall have another race to-morrow.
I hope, and 1 think that there will be I
plenty of wind for both yachts."
All those on board the Erin who saw
the race agreed that there were no |
flukes, but both yachts were sailed on j
their merits.
ahead. The elapsed time of the Columbia
for the fifteen miles was 2:47:13; of the
Shamrock, 2:57:05, showing the Columbia's
gain from the actual start bad been 19:59
This was a great victory for thÂ« Co
lumbia, for both yachts had covered the
distance in a steady breeze, and at no
time were they far enough apart to bene
fit by any puffs of wind. ,
The Columbia's balloon jib topsail was
set immediately after the spinnaker, and
the headsails hauled down. She began
her fifteen mile run to the finish at about
eight knots an hour. The Shamrock's
balloon jib topsail was set seven minutes
after rounding the outer mark, and for a
time it seemed as though she was over
hauling the Columbia. At the time that
appeared to be a reasonable conclusion,
because she, being the stern boat, was
in position to take advantage of any
squalls that might come along. It soon
became evident, however, that her ap
parent gain was only imaginary, and that
the Columbia was not only holding her
own, but, as the figures showed later, she,
was really gaining.
The finish line, marked by the commit
tee boat and the Sandy Hook light, was
not visible until the yachts were within
a couple of miles of it. Then there was
a rush of steamers to reach the goal
ahead of the yachts.
It could not be called an exciting finish
nor was It a tame one altogether. "So few
boats were present to witness it and the
weather was so depressing that as a spec
tacle the finish might be called a poor one
from a picturesque standpoint Both in
time and distance the yachts were so far
apart that it was a rather poor finish from
a sportsman's view. ;
When the Columbia, her groat yellow
mainsail abroad off to starboard, swept
across the finish line the Shamrock .was
scarcely visible astern, only the outlines
of her sails being seen. Ten minutes and
eleven seconds in time elapsed between
the finishing of the Columbia and the
Shamrock, which means in distance about
a mile and a half. .-. . â¢
The official time was: Columbia, 3:54:59;
Shamrock, 4:05:10.
Elapsed time: Columbia, 4:53:53; Sham
rock, 5:04:07. . - â 
Corrected time: Columbia, 4:53:53; Sham
rock. 5:04:01.
Thus the Columbia wins by 10 minutes
14 seconds actual and 10 minutes 8 seconds
corrected time.
The elapsed time of the Columbia from
the outer mark to the finish was 2 hours
6 minutes 40 seconds; Shamrock, 2 hours
i minutes 2 seconds, showing that in the
fifteen miles before the wind the Columbia
had gained 22 seconds. (
After the race while the yachts'were be
ing towed back to their moorings. Sir
Thomas Linton's yacht Erin ranged 'up
alongside the Columbia. The Erin's offi
cers and men. led by Sir Thomas, gave
three hearty cheers. They were quickly
responded to with cheers from the Co
lumbia's men, led by C. Oliver Iselin.
A number of yachts fired guns as salutes
to both yachts at the finish. The flagship
Corsair was among them, and as soon as
the American yacht had crossed the line
by mist, rain or distance from the re
ceiving station at the Highlands. Pas
sengers on the Grand Duchesse, who had
watched the operation of wireless teleg
raphy on clear days, agreed that it re
quired a fog to emphasize its value. Bet
ter conditions than those of to-day for*
a demonstration of its practicability and
usefulness are not possible.
The fog gave a horizon of about four
miles, making it impossible for the yachts
to be seen except from the boats that fol
lowed them over the thirty-mile course.
This was done by the Grand Duchesse,
and Marconi could at all times keep the
contestants in view. Every move of the
yachts was fully described in the bulletins
to the Herald and The Call. When the
Columbia and Shamrock engaged in a luff
ing match, one following the other's lead
and tacking with scarcely thirty seconds
between at times, the maneuver was
known in San Francisco before it had
been repeated. Those on board the Grand
Duchesse were all wide awake to what
was going on, and when word was passed
from the shore that the Marconi bul
letins were the only ones promptly giv
ing events of the race a hearty cheer was
given by the excursionists for the invent
or of wireless telegraphy. It at once be
came apparent that all other agencies for
reporting the race would prove unable to
cope with weather conditions which pro
vide both wind and fog. No glass was
powerful enough to pierce the mist which
every now and then dropped close to the
water.
The Grand Duchesse took its position
outside, the western patrol line and as
nearly as was possible on line with the
leading yacht. Signor Marconi, imbued
with the enthusiasm of the occasion and
convinced that in a way he had the world
at his mercy, pushed his assistants aside ;
and himself stood by the sending ap- j
paratus ready to catch the bulletins as I
they were handed him and flash them
through the fog to the receiving station !
on the Jersey coast. It was seen that the I
Columbia, in tacking to port at 17 minutes '
after 11 o'clock, had taken a slight lead, |
which the Shamrock was valiantly striv- i
ing to overcome. This was known to the
operators in the Herald oflice just one.
minutes and twenty seconds from the;
time it was noted by the watchers on the !
bridge of the Grand Duchesse.
The first four miles of the race carried
the yachts so far from the land telegraph
stations that it. was impossible for any
of the news agencies to even make a rea
sonable conjecture as to what was going
on. In the meantime Marconi had in- !
formed the public that the Columbia was
still outpointing the Shamrock and had I
made a gain of nearly half a mile in
windward work. Each successive gain j
made by the Columbia was reported and j
the relative positions of the yachts were
given from time to time. When the mark
boat placed the buoy for the turn at the I
Commodore J. Pierpont Morgan ordered
the American ensigns to be hoisted at
each masthead.
Every steamer saluted with her whistle
and the Shamrock's welcome was quite as
noisy as the Columbia's. The yachts and
the excursion fleet soon vanished in the
mist, homeward bound.
COLUMBIA AGAIN
FAVORITE IN BETTING
NEW YORK, Oct. 16.â Betting on the
races again changed to-night. Money had
been even when the excursion boats
steamed down the bay through the fog.
It had been 10 to 6 in favor of the Co
lumbia when the racers began their
course of failures. Then only even money
was given. Now betting again favors the
Columbia. Several bets to-night were
made on the cup â¢defender at odds of 10
to 6. A party of Wall street brokers who
had placed a combination wager of (1000
when -betting was even made merry over
! end of the fifteen-mile beat it was
promptly announced and the fact that
the Columbia led by a mile and a half as
j she approached the turn was flashed
ashore when the thick fog made it impos
! sible for the news to be communicated to
the waiting thousands in any other way.
When the Columbia swept down toward
i the lightship under a mountain of can
| vas and crossed 'the finish line, winning
j the first race of the series for the Amer
l ica's .cup, Marconi alone was enabled to
i announce the result before the smoke of
i the gun of the committee boat had disap
! peared.
' The reception that the winner received
from the attendant excursion boats and
yachts was reported, and the fact that
she dropped her head sails and took a
line from her tugboat before the Sham
rock finished was given. At the time of
the finish the fog shut in the yachts and'
excursion boats so that no glimpse of them
could be seen ftom the land, and the
quickest time in which the result of the
race could be taken ashore and delivered
at a telegraph office by any tug was at
least an hour. Marconi cabled abroad and
wired to San Francisco the news of the
Columbia's defeat of the Shamrock.
In Herald square was a big crowd before
the bulletin board. Although Marconi's
messages showed that the Columbia soon
after noon was a mile ahead of her rival,
one newspaper was announcing that up to
that time the race had been "marvelously
even" and that the Columbia "could not
be said to have any considerable lead over
the Shamrock." Herald square. resounded
with cheering when at four minutes of 4
Signor Marconi sent a message announc
ing that the Columbia had crossed the
line a winner at 3:55:15. This was the only
reliable news of the result received for
several minutes and the crowd became
highly enthusiastic. From Signor Mar
coni they learned a moment later a point
about which they were next most anx
ious, that was the extent of the Colum
bia's lead. Within a minute from the time
the Columbia's victory was announced
there came by wireless telegraphy the
news that the Shamrock was nearly a
mile behind when the Columbia crossed
the line. To this was added the news that
the 'excursion fleet was cheering the vic
tor and that the whistles on all the boats
were screeching in joy over the cup de
fender's success. The enthusiasm of those
ashore immediately joined that of those j
who had witnessed the race.
Five minutes after the result had been j
announced through messages from Mar
coni the bulletin was posted ty other !
papers. It was their first actual news of :
the result, although "dummy" editions of j
the Journal and the World had then been i
on the streets more than thirty minutes I
announcing the victory of the Columbia. ;
These "dummy" editions, bearing In red 1
and blue ink the announcement "Colum- i
bia wins," were on sale in the streets at
' their foresight at one of the larger hotels.
It was reported to-night at another hotel
! that a prominent member or Sir Thomas
i Lipton's party had sold a bet for' $1100
] on the Shamrock for $50 just before the
race this morning.
Several backers of the Columbia at the
! hotel? announced to-night that their side
: bets on the first race would clear all their
i expenses. In several cases their winnings
I amounted to more than $1000.

Mrs. Beulah Jorit 9 who. according to the

Webster Jones; is well known in society
circles in this ci'y. She is the eider laugh

aware of the troubles that have racked
the Jones household for a year past; in

patched up to the stent that separation
was mutually agreed upon and she was
permitted to bring the suit on milder
grounds than had been expected. it Is

that a Boer commando estimated at 2000
men. with sixteen field guns, has reached
Dannhauser. northeast of Dundee, with
the probable intention of surrounding
Dundfe and cutting off the garrison from
communication with Glencoe and Lady
smith. It is supposed that this force is
commanded by Commandant Viljien and
comprises the German gunners.
The rest of the Boer force from New
castle is believed to be marching around
Glencoe to sever its connections with
Ladysmith.
As the refugees in Cape Town threaten
to become troublesome and have hooted

THE SAX ERA CISCO CALL, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 17, 1899.
with respect to the situation in South Af
rica: "The dispatches received do not
point to any mat* change in the situa
tion. Small bodies of Boers are reported
to have crossed the Natal frontier at
various points, and lntrenchments are
said to have been thrown up at Van
Reenans Pass."
Tne Evening News publishes a dispatch
from Cape Town saying that as the Cape
Ministry refuses to call out the volunteers
for the defense of the colony, the im
perial authorities have done so.
On the other band, the Cape Town cor
respond of the Daily Chronicle de
clares that the imperial authorities have
never suggested any such action, and he
asserts that the widespread report re
garding the resignation, or intended resig
nation, of the Cape Premier, Mr.
Schreiner, is incorrect.

were taken up by the audience, amid the
waving of numberless union jacks. The

They have sent a few patriots down the

HOW THE ENGLISH
RECEIVED THE NEWS
LOXDOX. Oct. 17.â Partly owing to the
diminished interest after so many abor
tive attempts, and partly to disappoint
ment over the result of to-day's race for
the America's cup, London demonstra
tions were rather tame. Great crowds
had collected on the Thames embank
ment and at other places where the stand
ing of the yachts were posted and cheers
were frequently raised for both the
Columbia and Sir Thomas Llpton, but the
disappointment over the result was very
keen.
At the Hotel Cecil, where a crowd of
Americans had collected to await the
announcement of the ticker, cheers re
sounded. VYankee Doodle" was sung at
all the music halls. When the result was
communicated to the audiences there was
a general manifestation of disappoint
ment, but this speedily gave place to the
heartiest cheers and the bands played
American tur.es.
The Daily News says editorially this
(Tuesday) morning: "The Shamrock was
handsomely beaten. This was the more
mystifying as the weather was that in
wiiich the Shamrock is said to revel
Every prediction has been falsified, for
she only began to pull up on the home
stretch when the wind had fallen Ac
cording to our correspondent, seamanship
had a deal to do with it. The Shamrock
was outpointed and outfooted from the
start. The probability is that the yachts
are as nearly equal as can be and all the
difference lies in the Judgment with which
they are sailed. There is nothing left but
to wish for mild breezes. Meanwhile hail
Columbia for a very creditable piece of
work." -%:â¢' v
The Morning Post admits that the
Columbia pointed better than the Sham
rock, and says: li' we merely had yes
terday's race on which to base calcula
tions we should be obliged to acknowl
edge that the Columbia is the better boat
The records of the abortive races tell a
different story, and the Columbia cer
tainly had the best of the wind at a crit
ical part of the race. The sole excuse
that can be urged for the Shamrock is
that she did not sail as well as was ex
pected.""

CALL HEADQUARTERS. WILMING
TON HOTEL. WASHINGTON. Oct. 16.â
The Navy Department has at last come to
realize the necessity of strengthening the
naval force in the Philippine waters and
Institute an effective blockade. This ap
parently self-evident way of effectively
aiding the army in subduing the Filipinos
was proposed by Rear Admiral Bradford,
chief of the bureau of equipment, as fat
back as last June, but it appears as if the
Navy Department needed a stirring up by
Admiral Dewey, for it is only since his
return that additional ships have been
designated to join Rear Admiral Watson's
fleet.
Of those thirty-odd ships composing the
Asiatic squadron, the majority are either
too costly or unsuited for blockading ser
vice, ana the want of light-draught gun
boats is very much felt. The presence of
the Oregon, Baltimore and Charleston is
practically needless after the destruction
of the Spanish fleet. These vessels, aver
aging iiw.mjv a year to keep in commis
sion, are too expensive and cumbersome
for blockade service, and fifteen light
draught gunboats would be more effective
and economical. And yet the department
is said to contemplate sending the Brook
lyn, New Orleans and Newark over to
help Rear Admiral Watson shut out the
Filipinos from contact with the outer
world. The gunboats Marietta. Machias,
Nashville and Bancroft may also be sent
to the Philippines, and these latter vessels
will be of more use than the four cruisers
named.
In addition six light-draught gunboats
have been ordered from the Illinois Steel
Company to be shipped in sections to Ma
nila, there to be put together and
launched.
But all these preparations should have
been considered months ago and a cordon
of American vessels should by this time
be patrolling the coast of Luzon and pre
vent war material from abroad getting in
to the hands of the insurgents.
There are renegade Americans as well
as Chinese and Japanese and other for
eigners who are making money by sup
plying the Filipinos with the necessities
of war. and it would seem that so long as
this traffic is not effectively stopped our
soldiers have uphill work in subduing the
obstinate natives. With the war material
supply entirely or largely cut off the in
surgents will have to fall back to the use
of the bow and arrow and the end will
then not be far off.
The larger part of the American fleet
has its rendezvous in Manila Bay, while
the gunboats are patrolling the coast and
occasionally go up the rivers to pepper the
insurgents. Eleven small gunboats, rang
ing from 202 down to 42 tons, were pur
chased last July from the Spanish Gov
ernment and are doing good service. At
Hongkong Naval Constructor Hobson will
shortly complete the repairs on the cap
tured Spanish gunboats Isla de Cuba and
Isla de Luzon, of 1030 tons each, and the
Don Juan de Austria of 1159 tons. Thus
within three months the American naval
force in the Philippines is likely to consist
of the following vessels:
Noteâ M, monitor: a -c, armored cruiser; c.
cruiser; g b, gunboat.
Total. 41 vessels, of about 66,000 tons,
carrying approximately a total comple
ment of 5500 sailors and marines. The ves
sels designated by a * are either on their
way to the Philippines or preparing for
the voyage.
In addition there are three supply ships,
the Celtic. Glacier and Culgoa; the Iris,
distilling ship, and colliers Nanslan and
Zaflro, carrying about 450 men, making a
total available sea force of â¢ about 6000
bluejackets and marines.
The task of patrolling the coast line of
the island of Luzon, surrounded as it is by
numerous islands in proximity. will
be a difficult one. It is. however, practic
ally devoid of danger so far as relates to
attacks by the Filipinos, and the moral ef
fect will probably be conducive to check
filibustering and landing of contraband
cargoes, and with due vigilance the insur
rection is likely to get its quietus.

The Prompt Way to Cure Yourself When Symptoms
Show That Your Kidneys Are Out of Order.
To Test the Wooderful Merits of the Great Modern
Discovery, Swamp-Root, Every "Call" Reader
May Have a Sample Bottle SeQt pree by Mail.
The way to be well is to pay atten-
tion to your kidneys.
They are the most important organs
of the body â the blood filters.
All the blood in your body passes
through your kidneys once every three
minutes.
The kidneys strain or filter out the
impurities in the blood that is their
work.
Purifying your blood is not a question
of taking a laxative or physic.
Does your blood run through your
bowels?
What the bowel-cleaner does is to
throw out the poisons confined in your
bowels ready for absorption into your j
blood, but the poisons which are al-
ready in your blood, causing your pres- !
ent sickness, it leaves there.
There is no other way of purifying ;
your blood except by means of your I
kidneys.
That is why bowel-cleaners fail to j
do their workâ they fail to help the j
kidneys.
When you are sick, then, no matter I
what you think the name of your dis- |
ease is, the first thing you should do is
to afford aid to your kidneys by using '
Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root, the great !
Kidney Remedy.
In taking Swamp-Root you afford
natural help to nature, for Swamp-Root j
is the most perfect healer and gentle
aid to the kidneys that is known to

Special Dispatch to The a"i.
"WASHINGTON, Oct. 16.â The War De- I
partment to-day made public the report i
of Major General William R. Shafter.
commanding the Department of Califor- j
n!a and of the Columbia. The Depart
ment cf California, General Shafter says, j
required \ery little attention, owing to
the sm.il! number of troops quartered. |
The bulk of the work in this department
pertained entirely. to tbe transmission of j
stores and the shipment of men to the
Philippine* and tak'r.g care of those re

General Shafter says that the men in
thÂ© recruiting camp have Been systemat
ically and thoroughly instructed in their
various duties, with special attention to
target practice. They have shown them
t?ives Industrious and anxious to perfect
themselves ir. the use of their weapons.
He further says:
There can be no doubt of the wisdom at es
tablishing this camp and giving to raits a
1 relimir.ary course of instruction here. An
other advantage :r. keeping the recruits in th;S
camp is ttat It haa enabled the medical de
partment fo weed ont men irrttted for such
service. Had these rner. been -â â -.-. gj

ar.d if they hal survived" they would hare WÂ»n
a tax upon the hospital department and ulti
mately would have been ??nt back sick and
discourage.!, and the effect of their return upon
the recruiting work throughcut the country
would have bsen unfavorable. By gef.jr.g rid
of tlicm at the very outset they may return to
their homes tn fair emditfon at least.
A considerable number of hcrses. pur
chased in xh'x department, have given en
tire satisfiction and General Shafter says
that they are cheaper, considering the
cost of their transportation, than horses
purchase in ihe East.
He recomrnencs that so long as any
large- body of troops remain ir. the Phil
ippines the recruit camp be continued at
the Presidio ur.d tha: as a rule the troops
be congregated there and drilled for at
least thr_ j e month? bofr.re shipment.

In Madison the President was cheered
enthusiastically from the moment .'. his

party were driven immediately to the
State Capitol, a mile from the depot, -
detachment of militia acting as escort.
Probe 10,000 persons, eager to hear the
President speait, were masse i in front
of the CapitoL Directly in front of the
speaker's stand was a body of students
from the University of Wisconsin. They
took occasion to exercise their lungs V 'S
oroualy throughout the President s aa
dress. Mr. McKinley was introduced by
Governor Scofleld. in the course of his
speech the President -aid:
The voice of partisanship is hushed to-day
and the voice ol patriot.se is alone beard in
t.ie land. We fcr.ow neither party nor creed,
nor sect nor nationality in cur devotion to a
common country' and common l'.ag. We are
aii c^e in the presence of a great national
duty and there are no division* among us
whenever our flag is assailed, wherever and
by whomsoever. -.". . r.
I "We have gone through a war. the ceienty
; of which ar.d the results of which are scarcely
rivaied ia any *>tfcer war in -history. The
American arms triumphed on '.ar.d and on sea.
with unprec-eder.ted exemption from disease

They fcave broueht us great responsibility.
They have broueht us new acquisitions and

responsibilities, meet them with manly cour

duty ar.d do what in the sight of tod and
man is just and right.
One tribeâ a smail part of that tr:t<*- â is ques
tioning the sovereignty of the I7r.ited States in
the :-'â¢.- i of Luzon. The yen' people we
emancipated from oppression struck our f.ag
and shot our soldiers, ihe shedding cf bic-od
is anguish to my soul. The giving up> of the
iives of our bravest and best young men
wrir.es my h-art. The eheddinc of blood of
the misguided Filipinos ls a matter of sin

they are resisting the sovereignty of tht I'ni

United States, and as lone as thai &.â¢>-<= re ignty

is said that If the President would do this we
would have peace. The President has " no
power, even If he was disposed, which he Is
not to alienate a single f<x>t of territory which
we have honestly acquired, cr give up sover
eigrty over it to othÂ»r people. That power
belongs to the people. That piwer Is v-=Â»i
in C'.ngivss. which represents the people, and
no such power was ever given to the chief
c-xTutive by the j^eople. by Congress or -by
the constitution, and to nse such power would
be a base usurpation of the prerogative by the
chief executive of the Government. And then.
If wo were going to cede the Islands away,
to wtorn would we cede tbem? There Is no
government there but curs. The creat ma
jority of the people acknowledge allegiar.ee
to the T'nito.l States f.ac and are glad to have
the shelter of its protection.
iiy feljow-cHizens, the Philippines came to
os not <f oor own .-*rkir.g. None of ns ever
dreamed when this war commenced that we
were fo have either Porta Rico or the Philip
pine Islands. We went to war for civilization
and for humanity and to relieve our oppressed
neighbors in Cuba. I was one of thone who
held :,ack until the la-^t moment, hoping that
war might be averted. I did not want to in-
voire my countrymen in bloodshed. Uur the
war came and a few of those who wanted it
most are now trying to shirk its responsibili
ties. Man plans, but Ged Almighty cxÂ«cut^.
We ca'.not avoid our responsibility. There was
r.o fault In the victory. There must be no
halt ln upholding it. We have got the Philip
pines and our flag Is there.
At 4:40 o'clock the Presidential party j
retired to carriages and rode to the train. I
whkh left Immediately for Wauk^sha.
WAUKESHA, Wis.. Oct. 16.â Five thou- j
sand people gathered around the Xorth
western Railway station here to see the

o'clock. The President and members ot
his Cabinet were escorted to a stand near !
the President's car.. It was. perhaps, the j
noisiest crowd yet faced by the Pre?!- j
dent in the Northwest. It the conclu
sion of the speech Miss Edith Wilbur]
daughter of the millionaire lumberman of
this city, stepped to the platform and
presented the President with a silver lov
ing cup and a bottle of mineral water
that has made Waukesha famous. The
President thanked Miss Wilbur and the
train left Immediately for Milwaukee.
MILWAUKEE. Wis.. Oct. 16.â The spe

party arrived in this city at 7 o'clock this

enthusiastic AS the train entered the
depot Battery A. First Artillery, W. N*. G.. f
fired the President's salute of twenty-One j
guns rom Juneau Park, which faces the i

tlian we have ever been before. The _________ of
the South and the men of the Xorth have been
fighting for the same flag and dying for the
6ame flag, and shedding their blood together
fvr the honor of the country. Lawton and
Wheaton In the Philippines are fighting side by
side to-day. My fellow-citizens, the ....
humanity ha* been triumphant and that cause,

who will.
At Ackley, lowa, the next stop, Mr. Mc

my former visit to this people, now. I believe,
five years ago. I congratulate you upon the

President spoke to a large crowd h*re a? ;
ws:
My Fellow-citizens: The people are think- ;
ir.e about Just one thing now in this country. , ,
The thoughts of the citizens of the ("nited

more than at this very hour. They rallied

At ihis point the school children waved
their flags and the President said:
The little ones have been studying their
geography, and that territory, my â fellow-citi
zens, the President has no power to alienate.
if he was disposed to do seÂ», which ho :s not.
The sovereignty of the United States ln the

dent. That sovereignty belongs to the people,
j and so long as lt is our territory; and so long
j as our sovereignty ls there by rightâ not by
rieht of conquest only, but by right of solemn
treatyâ the President of the United States has
but one duty to perform and that Is to main
tain and establish the authority of the I'nited

He could not do less and perform hi? duty,

MANCHESTER. lowa. Oct. 16.â The fol
lowing address was made here by the
President to an enthusiastic crowd:
lly Fellow-citizens: We have had more than
a hundred years of national existence. These
years have been blessed ones fcr .-â â â  and
civilization. The ship of state has sailed on
uninterruptedly on its mission of liberty, and
one thins: that can be said of this nation for
which we should all give thanksgiving and
praiseâ lt never raised its arm against hu
manity, never struck a blow against liberty,
never struck a blow except for civilization
and mankind, and now that we are seventy
six millions of people, I do not think we have
lost our rigor our virtue, our courage, our
high purpose or patriotism. We are just as
strong for our country as we ever were, and
we are Just as sensible of national honor as
cur fathers were and just as determined to
keep unsullied the American name as those
who created us a nation.
This, my countrymen. Is not a partisan
Government. While parties control admin
istrations, in the presence of great national
peril or a great natior.al duty, the people are
united as one man. all for country, and the
people - * heart to-day goes to the soldiers
who are doing battle for the "ountrv in the
Philippines. Your hearts are with them, your
hopes are with them, your prayers are with
them, ar.d if I am not mistaken'the American
people do not propose, whatever ... the
cause, to see our flag dishonored anywhere.
DUBUQUE. lowa. Oct. 15.â The citizens
of Dubuque, the home of Senator Allison
gave the Presidential party an enthusias
tic reception to-day li spite of a steady
downpour of rain. The President said:"
This is a year of sublime patriotism. From
one end of your State to the other, through
all sections of the West over which we have
traveled we have heard but one musicâ the
music of the nation: but one songâ the hymn
of the republic. at.', we have m-â¢ but one
flag, the flag of cur fathers and ours the flag
of a happy, reunited, a never-to-be-broken na
tion, a flag that expresses our hopes, our pur
poses and our faith, a flag thai expresses the
sacrifices we are willing to make for It any
where and everywhere.
I have come to-day, my fellow-citizens, not
only to greet you a!'., but to make public ac
knowledgment In this city of the patriotism
of the people of lowa. You not only served
and sacrificed for the nation in the great Civil
War. giving up many of the beet yonng men
of the State upon the altar of country that
the nation might be preserved, but in the war
with Spain this State almost the first of the
Federal Union answered to the call of the
Government. .'..J.i-".
All of your soldiers did not have service on
the firing line, but they were ready and anxi
ous to go and disappointed that they were not
permitted to go. But to them I want to say
tbey have, like the soldiers at the front won
the gratitude of the republic for the State
A r.d of the boys sent to . the Philippines I
want to say that they did even more than was
required by their terms of enlistment. They
had the privilege of beine must-red out when
the ratifications of the treaty of peace were
exchangedâ that was the end of their term if
they had sought to claim their privilege ' but
when lt was offered to them they refused to
accept, it. Â ' .;- 'v-V;
They said. "We will stay with the Govern
ment, we will stay with the flag, until you
'â an make a new army to take our place's "'
And they did.
All honor to the lowa Regiment In the Philip
pines, now that their faces are turned home
ward. God grant them a safe arrival In the
old State among their friends and families.
And now. my fellow-citizens. I simp!-. want
to say one other thing, and that is that our
flag in the Philippines still waves there, and
it waves not as a tanner of Imperialism, It '
waves not as a symbol of oppression, but it
waves as It waves here and everywhereâ thÂ« j
flag of freedom, of hope, of civilization.
PROBABLY WENT DOWN

'â  Waterlogged * Bark Sighted at Sea
â¢ Disappeared Before Aid Could
Be Rendered.
NEW YORK, Oct 16.â The brig Motley
arrived from Surinam after a passage of
twenty-five days. Captain Diller reports
that on October 3. latitude 33, longitude
76 io, he sighted a wreck, Apparently a
bark, dismasted and waterlogged, with
the crew on board. As a heavy gale of
wind was blowing and high seas were
running he could not render them any as
sistance. As night was approaching he
hove to until daylight and the next day
cruised around in search of the wreck but
she had disappeared. Apparently she
foundered during the night.
LOUISVILLE. Kv., Oct. 16.â The first
'â  day's trip of the Bryan-Goebel party
j through Kentucky commenced this
morning at Cairo, 111.. the first
; speech of the day being made at
i Bardwp;;. Ky., in the presence of a good
j natured and good-sized crowd. The spe
cial train reached the Kentucky town at
| ?:30 o'clock. In his opening address Mr.
i Bryan demonstrated his purpose to urge
j the support of the Democratic State ticket
| headed by William Goebel for Governor.
} He held that the question whether or not
| the next President of the United States
j were a Democrat depended largely upon
j whether Kentucky were Democratic this
i fall. He held that it was not a matter of
I moment what man headed the ticket,
'. claiming that any Democrat who stood for
! the Chicago platform was better than a
Republican. This question was one as to
principles between the parties.
Mr. Bryan assailed the attitude of
President McKinley as related to the
Philippine Islands, asserting that the
President's declaration that Congress
would care for the islands was a subver- j
sion of the Declaration of Independence
and the first to be openly made by a
President of the United States. The dec
laration of the President suggested the
use of the word parliament instead of ]
congress, and recalled the colonial days
and policy of King George. The islands
did not and could not belong to us simply
because we had paid a decaying mon- |
archy for them.
The silver question and the Chicago '
platform as a whole. Mr. Bryan declared. !
form the vital questions to be solved in j
the coming political contest of ISOO.
At Fulton. Paducah. Benton and Prince- â¢
ton there were large crowds of enthus
iastic Democrats. At all these points Mr. :
Bryan covered about the same ground '
as in his speech at Bardwell.
From Princeton the special was divert- 'â 
ed to Hopkinsville, a distance of thirty
miles from the main line of the Illinois
Central. There were liberal decorations
at Hopkinsville and great enthusiasm. I
From Hopkinsville the Louisville and !
Nashville road was utilized in reaching
Norton, where the main line of the Illi
nois Central was again struck, and the
next stop, just as evening came on, was
at Circle City. The crowd here was very
enthusiastic, especially on State topics. |
From Circle City the special sped on to I
Litehneld. the last stop of the day, prior
to passing the night at Louisville.
Among thos* who were present on the
trip were: Mr. and Mrs. William J.
Bryan. I rev Woodson, national commit- I
teeman from Kentucky; William Goebel,!
candidate for Governor: Captain James [
Blackburn, brother of Senator J C. S i
Blackburn: G. G. Coulter, candidate for.'

The Agrarian organ adds that it is- not
impossible that Gcrmanv will accept the
proposal, provided that a very high in
demnity is paid.
I am. however, informed by the Foreign
Ofiice that the report the Schlesische
Zeitung is an indiscretion and is not quite
exact. It is true that Encland has made
the proposal in question, but it was de
clined. As a consequence the North
German Gazette declares that Germany's
position on the Samoan question remains
unchanged. i am. however, informed
that in regard to the question of com
pensation to individuals both Germany
and England have agreed to appeal to ar
bitration if they fail to come to an agree
ment otherwise. The cons of the
I'nited States to this course has not ar
rived, but there is no doubt that the reply
will be favorable.
MURDERED AND HIS

Fate of the Master of the Oyster
Sloop Dream in Maryland
Waters.
BALTIMORE Oct. IC.-The little oyster '
sloop "ream, on fire, drifted Into Rock
Creek yesterday, bearing evidence that I
a mi:- had been committed on her
deck. The dismembered portions of a
white man's body, supposed to be that of
Captain Oliver Caulk, her owner and<*
commander, were found after the fire 1
had been extinguished. A colored deck- i
hand named Frank Collier is missing and
he probably shared the fate of the cap
tain. I
The police are searching for a myste
rious stranger who boarded the DrÂ»am
on Saturday and asked to be taken to
St. Michaels. Talbot County, her home
port, whither she was bound. The vessel
sailed on Saturday evening. On Sunday
morning she drifted into Rock Creek,
eight miles below the city. An unknown
man was picked up off Sparrows Point,
nearly opposite Rock Creek, yesterday
morning from a yawl boat by the crew of
the schooner Amelia and brought to Bal
timore, where he disappeared. The po
lice believe that this man is the murderer.
Captain Caulk had about $300 on his per
son when he sailed on Saturday.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CRESCENT CITT, Oct. 16.â tragic
death of Mrs. Christina Edson at Gold
Beach, Or., last week, it has developed,
was a most fiendish murder. A young
man named Coleman Gilisole, arrested a
few days ago at Cottage Grove, l_a.n_
County, Or., upon suspicion, has "since
made a confession of the terrible deed.
Gllispie by his own statement went in
the night to the secluded little home of
the widow and demanded of her a pen
sion check for 575 which she had received
but a short time previously. Mrs. Edson,
declining to comply with the request, the
assassin seized her by the throat and
choked her til! she was almost lifeless.
Then relaxing his grasp he succeeded by
threats in securing the paper and its
assignment. But his design was not yet
accomplished. Again clutching the help
less woman by the threat he held her
prostrate till life was extinct. He then
searched the premises for valuables, find
ing only $11 50 in money and a few arti
cles of jewelry, some of which he took
off the corpse. Next he repaired to the
pantry, from which he secured victuals
for a luncheon. After leisurely eating a
repast he proceeded to saturate the cloth
ing of his victim with coal oil and apply
ing a lighted match walked away.
Suspicion was first attracted to Gil
ispie when he presented his sweetheart
with a ring which he had removed from
the hand of the murdered woman. The
second link forged in the chain of circum
stances leading to his capture was the
selling of the pension check to a ranch*
in Coos County, to whom he made false
representation as to the manner in which
he had become possessed of it.
Gilisple is of notoriously bad character
aside from the charge now pending, hav
ing been accused of various crimes. He
was accused of horse-stealing and would
have been convicted but for the influence
of relatives and their money.
Mrs. Edson was a pioneer of the coun
ty wherein she was murdered and highly
esteemed. During an outbreak of the
Rogue River Indians in 1556 she was com
pelled to witness the slaying and scalp
ing of her husband and two sons, after
which she and her daughter, now Mrs
Fred Blake of Chetco, Or., fell captive to
the Indians and were so held for a num
ber of weeks, when they were at length
ransomed by the gift of maj required
articles of use and ornament* from the
whites.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
WILLOWS. Oct. JC.-The famous Mur
dock case, which created such excitement
ln this State and county while being tried
here last spring, was to-day dismissed
upon the application of Frank Freeman,
attorney for Mary Helen Murdock, the
case being settled out of court.
William Murdock, a wealthy fanner of
this county, died here ln 1594, and as soon
as his will was admitted to probate Mary
Helen Murdock presented a note against
the estate for $100,000, due twenty years
after date, and dated at OHmpo, Septem
ber 5, 1577. The claim was rejected and
suit was brought, but as the note did not
come due until _K<l that suit was dis
missed. Mrs. Murdock then began suit
through her attorneys, Cannon & Free
man, in September. 1897. This suit was
to-day dismissed. The executors claimed
the note to be a forgery, and this was
the defense made at the trial in April
last. The trial of the case consume* the
better part of two months and resulted in
a mistrial, the jury being equally divided.
The end of the trial was looked upon as a
victory for Mary Helen Murdock, as she
was lighting without money and the es
tate was spending money lavishly on all ;
sides. Something like- $10,000 was paid
for writing experts alone.
Just what the figure was that ended the j
suit cannot be obtained, as both Bides
refuse to discuss the matter: but from ;
the best information obtainable the 'â¢
amount paid was close to $90,000.

+OSTAOB PREPAID.THE CITY CANNOT WIN
THE BIG CONVENTIONS
Telegraph Companies Put a
Veto Upon the Proposal.
An Insurmountable Obstacle Presented to
the Success of the Project Which
All Citizens Indorse.
THE great telegraph companies have
placed an absolute veto upon the
splendid project to bring the con
ventions bf the two national politi
cal parties to this city.' The official
Fpokesmen of tho Western l nlon
Telegraph Company and the Postal Tele
graph Company declare that the corpora
tions which they represent are unable to
meet one bf the conditions which nee,
sity would demand In the event of a
session of either the Republican or the
Democratic national convention In San
Francisco. The leading newspapers of the
l'nion will insist, as they have insisted
before, that complete and Individual re
ports of the convention proceedings be
sent to them by their special correspond
ents. This would involve the telegraphic
transmission of over half a million words
a day across the continent if either of
the conventions were held in fids city.
Both- of the telegraph companies an
nounce that they are utterly unable to
undertake such a gigantic task and con
sequently, however deeply the people and
public spirited , citizens of the city may
regret the loss of what would be a uni
versally conceded advantage, the condi
tion must be accepted and the project
Bbandoned. The same lack of telegraphic
facilities has robbed San* Francisco of the
honor and advantage of a national po
litical convent three times â 'â â  twelve
years.
National political leaders of both par
ties and fair minded people of other
States have admitted that this city, as
one of the great cities of the Union, is
entitled to the honor of a national con
vention. The citizens of San Francisco
have pleaded with both national parties
for such an honor. The people of the
State, Irrespective of political ties, have
time and again lent their assistance.
Members of both national committees
have not only promised their votes for
Ban Francisoo, but have given them. The
city has guaranteed thousands of dollars
for the entertainment of national dele
gates and has sent representatives to
Washington to plead with the national
committees and promise all but one of
the facilities and accommodations that
are necessary to the success of a na
tional convention. The single facility
that could not be promised and which
cannot now be supplied has proved the
unfailing obstacle to success. It is the
inability cf the telegraph companies to
eend across the continent the news of the
convention proceedings.
In past efforts tne people of the city
have deluded themselves to the last mo
ment with a hope of success. They have
gone to great expenditure of money and
time for no purpose. While San Francis
co Is now more than ever entitled to at
least one of the national conventions if
not both, the regrettable fact remains that
she cannot have either. The telegraph
companies are no more able now than
they were twelve j-ears ago to handle
the tremendous volume of news which
proceeds from a national convention.
Representatives of the two great com
panies, who speak with authority, de
clare that the corporations for which
thej- speak will not attempt to repair
their admitted weakness. They declare.
In the first place, that it would be neces
sary to duplicate the systems now ln use
In order to transmit the news telegraph
ically across the continent.
Such an undertaking would Involve a
cost Car In excess of any prospective
profit from convention work and the com
panies refuse positively to incur a loss.
In the second place the managers of the
companies declare ihat even if the cor
porations were disposed to supply the
facilities necessary for the ''transmission
of news they could not do so in the time
that now remains before the meetings of
the two conventions. San Francisco
must therefore accept the failure which
all of Its citizens and well-wishers must
look upon ns fortunate and undeserved, j
The present movement, which, with a
reasonable prospect of success would be
commendable, is neither new nor feasible.
Several limes before officials of the city
end State, political and civic organiza
tions and prominent citizens of all polit
ical creeds have united in agitating a
project that would have been of the
greatest advantage to California. But
after the members of the two great na
tional political parties had given their
promises and inclined their heartiest sup
port they Interviewed the representatives
of the telegraph companies and found
that one of the most vital elements of
convention success with San Francisco as
a headquarters was an Impossibility.
The leading newspapers of the Union
Insisted that they be guaranteed the right
to transmit convention news to suit them
selves individually. They refused positive
ly to accept reports which their rivals
would also receive. The transmission of
such r.ews is of primary Importance to
both parties and when the telegraph com
panies announced that they could not send
it. San Francisco dropped from the list of
available aspirants for convention honors.
"What the members of both national
committees have done time and again be
fore and what they will do again The Call
has already done. It has secured Inter
views from Frank Jaynes, superintendent
of the Western Union Telegraph Com
pany, and from Assistant Superintendent
Swain of the Postal Telegraph Company.
Both declare that their companies are ut
terly unable to handle the enormous vol
ume of telegraphic matter that would be
effered by American newspaper represent
atives at a national political convention
held in this city.
Superintendent Jaynes of the Western
l'nion Telegraph Company says that his
company has not the facilities for such a
tremendous task, and more than that, will
not attempt to secure them. The time is
too limited, he says, the . expense too
great, and th" undertaking too large. In
an interview yesterday he spoke as fol
lows:
It will be absolutely impossible for
the two telegraph companies com
bined to handle the news in the event
of the national conventions being
held in this city. While I would like
very much to have them come here
the undertaking is too large for the
telegraphic facilities at present avail
able. It will require several hun
dred wires in addition to the present
equipment, which wires would have
to be stretched across the continent
to Chicago at least, and even if the
companies should decide to string the
extra wires the time is/too limited
to put them in place for the conven
tions. It would practically necessi
tate a duplicate of the system now
in operation and the scheme is im
practicable.
The combined equipment of the
Western Union and Postal Telegraph
systems would be but a fraction of
what would be necessary to handle
the business. To build the necessary
additional equipment would require a
vast sum of money which the com
panies would not feel justified in ex
pending on a proposition which at
best is merely of a temporary char
acter.
It is impossible, for there would be
need of so many special wires
and special reports that the news
could not be telegraphed in the man
ner in which the great Eastern dail
ies would desire it.
Assistant Superintendent Swain of the
Postal Telegraph Company has practically
the same obstacle to offer. He is con
vinced that a vast sum of money would
be required to equip the telegraph com
panies properly for the task, and the com
panies will not bear the burden of such an
expenditure. In an interview yesterday
he said,- speaking for L. \V. Storrer, the
superintendent:
The two telegraph companies could
not handle half the business which
would result if the party conven
tions were held in this city. When
we consider that over a million words
and more will be telegraphed daily,
an idea of the magnitude of the busi
ness may be obtained. Now the plan
would be feasible if these reports
would be accepted by all the great
dailies, but they will have their
special staff of representatives on the
scene and special reports without end
will be sent.
It would be necessary to add a
large number of wires to the overland
system, and in some cases the plant
ing of new telegraph poles. Con
siderably more than a million dollars
would be required to increase the sys
tem to its needed proportions, and it
is not > likely that the companies
would go to the expense for a propo
sition which would last m>t over four
weeks in all. After that the com
panies would be obliged to take
down the wires again, thus adding
largely to the expense. The plan
would be feasible if the Eastern
dailies would take the one report, but
this they will not do as special re
ports will be their aim and an un
told number of these will be tele
graphed about the proceedings.
I am sure that if the proposition
were practicable it would be carried
out, as California would reap incal
culable benefits by the presence of
the two big conventions, but the cold,
serious fact is that the two telegraph
companies would be unable to handle
the news to the satisfaction of the
Eastern dailies.
These interviews prove beyond the shad
ow of question that the earnest desire of
every public-spirited citizen of San Fran

HORACE DAVIS TO ADDRESS
DISTRICT MEETINGS.
â¢
Signs of the Contest Point Toward
the "Complete Success of
the Republican
Causa.
The municipal campaign which the Re
publicans opened under cheering auspices
at Metropolitan Hall last Saturday even
ing will be conducted in a vigorous and
effective manner, until the polls close on
election day. Signs of the complete suc
cess of the Repvbllan ticket are multi
plying. The Republican leader, Horace
Davis, possesses the- confidence of all
classes of citizens. Many voters who are
not partisans In the strict sense of the
word have openly announced their deter
mination to support him.
The Republican Supervisorial ticket has
been strengthened by the nomination of
I. J. Truman, the present Treasurer of the
city, and Emmet P. Barrett. In every es
sential respect Mr. Truman Is a stronger
man than Mr. Britton, who was persuaded
to withdraw from the ticket. In the pre
liminary and active work of framing the
new charter Mr. Truman was more atten
tive and useful than Mr. Britton. He had
ideas concerning municipal government
and did not hesitate to give his fellow citi
zens the benefit of his studies in the field
of charter-making.
Yesterday Alfred Bouvler, chairman of
the new Republican County Committee,
appointed an executive committee as fol
lows:
Charles L. Franklin I Alfred Bouvler
E. H. Lutgens Edward M. Buckley
Daniel Crane John J. Daughrey

Maurice Brandt Geo. W. Pennington
I. J. Truman Jr. A. R. Simmons
Charles L. Benton A. B. Truman
L. A. Rea ! George Whnmer
Thomas R. Evans l James A. Wilson
It will be observed that the eighteen
committeemen-at-large recently appointed
by Sheldon G. Kellogg, chairman of the
Republican convention, are assigned to
duty on the executive committee. They
are reinforced by eighteen others, one
from each Assembly district, making a
committee of thirty-six.
To-night, at 723 Market street. History
building, the executive committee will
meet to devise plans for a vigorous con
duct of the campaign. It ls expected that
every man on the ticket, everj' man on the
committee, every Republican voter of the
city, and all citizens of San Francisco
desiring good municipal government, will
lend their services to the good cause of
electing Horace Davis and the entire
ticket.
G"ie of the first steps toward success
will be the organization of clubs In the
various -â¢ Assembly districts. Meetings
will be held from time to time throughout
the city, under the auspices of the As
sembly district clubs. Horace Davis will
go from place to place and address his
fellow citizens. The workingmen will give
him a great welcome, as he is a man of
the plain people, in close touch and sympa
thy with the everyday workers of the
world.
The Cotmty Committee has established
headquarters In the History building, ad
joining the rooms occupied by the Horace
Davis Central Republican Club.
St. Brendan's Fair
St. Brendan's Church fair will close to
morrow evening. There are many articles
of value in the various booths, which will
be disposed of by raffle. Last evening all
the householders in the neighborhood
were present and many had good luck.
The notice was conspicuously posted on
the outside of the building at "the corner
of Fremont and " Harrison streets, in
which the fair is held, that admittance
was free. There will be no admission fee
to the end of the fair. All are welcome.

SAMPSON'S CRITICISMS
FIND SHAFTER UNRUFFLED
Says He Cannot Understand the
Admiral's Attitude,
The Santiago Campaign Speaks for Itself,
He Declares, and It Should Testify
I to His Ability.
IT is not often an admiral of the navy
publicly criticizes a major general of
the army, but If ho be* quoted cor
rectly that is what Admiral Samp
son has been doing. In a dispatch
from Boston dated October 15
Sampson is Quoted as saying that to
Captain Chadwick, commander of the
17. 3. 8. New York, was due the credit of
the surrender of Toral, he having written
the letter demanding the surrender and
having suggested the course to pursue to
secure Toral's final downfall. And, fur
ther, Admiral Sampson la quoted as say
ing that it was due to Shatter's ignor
ance thÂ«t Total was free as long as he
was, and had it not been for Chadwick's
advice and assistance. Toral might have
held on indefinitely.
The utterances of Sampson are very
similar to some things he said in an ad
dress before an audience in Morgans
town, W. Va., some time ago. On that
occasion, however, he confined his criti
cisms to the statement that Shafter al
lowed his army to run away from him
in Cuba because he was Incapable of
properly commanding it. His more re
cent remarks are but a repetition with
more details added.
General Shafter declines to enter into
any controversy with the admiral over
the Cuban campaign. He says he will
not make a newspaper tight out of 'it,
and he intimates that it is hardly the
proper thing for a major general of the
army and an admiral of the navy to air
their grievances, however real or fan
cied, for the benefit and entertainment of
1 "I was ordered by the President to take
Santiago and drive out Cerveraa fleet '

Captain Chadwick was with me the day
I sent the demand for surrender, but the
demand was. not sent upon his advice
nor with his material assistance. He and
I discussed the situation; he was very
courteous and he offered some sugges
tions, but they were toward the form of
address, not to the substance of the de
mand. I was not mincing words. I was
not addressing "your excellency or your
honor.' I wrote the demand In plain
English, and then it was that Captain
Chadwick suggested a different form in
addressing Toral. J I accepted his sugges
tions and he copied my dispatch. He
wrote the message that was sent, but
what he wrote was a copy of my demand.
The handwriting was his and the form
of the address, but it Is foolish to say
he made the demand for surrender upon
Toral. , _. , , ,

believe that an officer of his rank would
descend to personalities against an officer
of my rank. What he ,fs quoted as saying
Is pure personality. It is not criticism,
even if criticism were allowable under
the circumstances and from such a
source; it Is pure personality, and it would
not be proper for me to reply to it. There
has never been any criticism of my cam
paign from any one who would be sup
posed to be an authority, but the opinions
of a man in Admiral Sampson's position
are taken with a good deal of weight. I
cannot understand how he can have said
the things credited to him."
SHAFTER HONORED.
According to expectations, General
Shafter was retired and retained yester
their relations as city officials.
Chinese music, Chinese gin and Chi- <Â£
nese rice and rats are always plentiful &
at the tong's meetings. Beer is per- -f

Knives, forks and spoons are tabooed
at the banquets, hut chopsticks are Â£
provided for all. The tong has been 5
unable to secure any permanent head- 55
quarters for the reason that the beau- +
ty of the Celestial music is not ap-. 88
predated by the citizens generally, Â£
who have on several occasions sought +.
to break up sessions of the hatchet-' J8
men by having their musicians arrest- +
ed for disturbing the peace. This lack 85
of appreciation on the part of the out- +
siders has forced the tong to forego 5?
the pleasure of meeting twice in the gÂ»

The Alameda highbinders have at- 88

The retirement of Brigadier General
Shafter was accomplished in the order to
which the following telegram refers:
t WASHINGTON, .Oct. 16.â Major General Wil
i liam R. Shifter, Commanding Department Qf
California, Ban Francisco: The following or
l der has Just been signed:
War Department, Washington, October 16,

â  is retired from active service October 16, 1599,
1 as brigadier general. United States army, only,
under the provisions of the act of Congress.

H. C. CORBIX, Adjutant General.
In the same order is contained the au
thority he will exercise in the future over
the Department of California and all the
troops that come and go under its Juris
diction.
General Shafter received the congratula
tions from many of his numerous friends
upon the distinction conferred upon him
by the President, for it is undoubtedly a
distinction for the general as well as an
advantage to the service. It is more tnan
probable that he will retain ids position
as long as the state of affairs in the isl
ands remains as it is, and as long as vol
unteers are in the field. General Shafter
is now the ranking volunteer officer, with
Major General Elwell S. Otis next below
him.
The favored ones of the Thirty-first
Regiment are enjoying the first days of
their release from quarantine in the city.
There are not many of the officers or
men allowed to leave the island, even
though the health restriction has been re
moved, and misbehavior during quaran
tine is bearing fruit now in continued de
tention. The regiment will get away next
Saturday under present programme, on
the transports Tartar and Manuenseâ ten
companies on the Tartar and two on the
Manuense.
Isaac Richardson, corporal Company H,
Idaho Volunteeers, died at the general
hospital yesterday. Charles Bartle, a pri-
I vate in Company L of the Colorado vol
| unteers, died in the hospital late Sunday
night. Both men had been discharged
with their regiments.

The Montana men will be mustered out
of service to-day, and to-morrow evening
they will start homeward on a special
train. The time for the departure of the
train has been set for 9 o'clock. The men
will draw close to $100 apiece when they
are given their discharges. Last even
ing, being the evening before muster out,
the regiment indulged in a little Jollifica
tion with the assistance of the Kansas
men. There was the firing off of captured
rifles, cheers, stories and the repledging
of friendships formed on the firing lines
In the islands. There is the most kindly
feeling existing between the two com
mands.
A general court-martial has been ap
pointed to meet at the Presidio on Friday
next. The detail for the court is: Major

A board of officers was appointed to
meet at Folsom street wharf yesterday
to inspect the transports Tartar and
Newport. The board carefully examined
into the condition of the ships to ascer
tain whether or. not the accommodations
are sufficient and proper for the number
of troops they habitually carry. Special
inquiry was made as to the subsisting of
discharged soldiers returning from the
Philippines; whether or not they were
supplied on the last homeward trip of
these transports with the full army ra
tion, and whether or not such ration was
properly prepared and served. The de
tail for the board was: . Colonel Charles
R. Greenleaf, assistant surgeon general:
Major Hugh J. Gallagher, commissary of
subsistence, United States Volunteers;
First Lieutenant Eugene T. Wilson,
Third Artillery, aid.- Captain John Bar
neson, marine superintendent. United

The doctor was accompanied by his

long journey and retired shortly after
reaching his temporary abiding place. To
night he will be tendered a reception by
hls congregation in the parlors of the
C. M. E. Church on Mission street, near
Sixth. An excellent programme has been
arranged for the occasion in his honor. ' It
Is understood that he will deliver a short
speech to his new friends. On Wednes

deliver his initial sermon. He will also
speak in the evening. <y- .-"â¢" -
At the conference just closed Bishop
Ninde appointed Dr. Hutsinpillar to the
Central M. E. Church. The minister
comes to this coast in th.Â» prime of life,
being about 40 years of age. He has had
a very successful career, occupying the
largest churches in Ohio. He is a grad
uate of the Ohio Wesleyan University.
For the past twelve months Dr. Hutsin
pillar has been traveling in Europe. On
his return to this country he received
many calls from Eastern churches, but
believing there was a good field on this
coast he accepted a call from the Central '
M. E. Church. He will prove beyond a

FIGHTING CALIFORNIA.
SAM JONES' familiar saying. "It is a hit dog
that yelps," finds many an illustration in the
anairs of life. Yesterday a new or.c was af
forded by the afternoon organ of the Southern Pa
cific Railroad.. Because The Call exposed an effort
of the company to have one of its' reliable "friends"
foisted upon the Interstate Commerce Commission
under the pretense of being a representative of Cali
fornia and the Pacific "Coast, the little organ yelps
out "The Call is fighting California."
The charge of righting California is one The Call
need not take the trouble to refute. The record of
the paper has-been one of consistent support to
every interest of the State and of its people. If there
be any fool who believes the appointment of General
Chipman or any other man equally bound to the
railroad wouid benefit California we are willing he
should regard us as a foe of the State. V.'c appeal
to intelligent pecple. We address men who have un
derstanding. We oppose the railroad's candidate for
a position on the Interstate Commerce Commission
because we know that ar.y rr.an selected by Herrin
and other railroad touts would serve the rail
road rather than the Pacific Coast; would see!-:
not to guard the rests of the public but to fasten
upon the State, ar.d as far as possible upon the coast,
the domination of the monopoly.
. It is not likely 2ny considerable number of people
will confound the South* Pacific Company with
California. Doubtless the railroad managers have so
long regarded the State as the lawful prey of the rail
road they cannot see any difference between them
and sincerely believe service to the road is service to
the State. Among the people a different idea prevails.
The whole course of the Southern Pacific Company
shows that its objects are directly hostile to the pub
lic welfare. The man whom Huntington would
recommend as Â£ member of the Interstate Commerce
Commission is the man whom the people will have
most reason to distrust. No man can serve both
God and mammon, neither can any serve both Cali
fornia and the Southern Pacific.
The Call was prompt to commend a movement on
the part of the Traffic Association to obtain a Pacific
Coast representative" on the Commerce Commission.
It will continue to support that movement until the
desired end is attained, but by a representative of the
coast it does not mean an agent or an attorney of the
railroad. It stands guard against just such a con
tingency, and the effectiveness of the guard is proven
by the yelp that has followed the first stone it threw
a: the railroad candidate.
Grove Ayers can consider himself the luckiest man
in town. It is true, as a result of the fire that broke
out on his person last Sunday, that he will have to
wear a wig on his wishbone, but he can congratulate
himself Shal he escaped alive, in spite of the fact that
his fire insurance policy had run out the day before.
The record of having expended in the fifty years
of its work in California more than $6,000,000 for
charity and mutual help is one. the Odd Fellows of
the State may well be proud of. and the State is
proud of them. Such liberality of aid attests a fra
ternalism of the rig - kind.
Will wonders never cease? On top of the infor
mation that there is a project under way to erect in
Gotham a half-million dollar hotel exclusively for
women comes the statement that up to date the pro
posed location of the hostelry has been kept a
We can now have another great international conÂ»
test with our British friends by starting a rivalry to
see whether Otis can whip the Filipinos before Buller
whips the Boers. A forward march of both the con
testants would beat the yacht race.

G. W. Lanorette, who has been traveling with the
Main circus as the "Starved Cuban." died suddenly
at Merced! It is supposed his taking off was the re
sult of apoplexy induced by over-eating.
Wishing to divorce himself from the cares of busi
ness for a few weeks, it is appropriate that President
McKinley should pass some of that time in South
Dakota. V â 
WATER STORAGE.
THE Escondido Times, which " "â >â¢ be regarded
as the California organ of the National Irriga
tion Congress, says of the coming water stor
; age convention in this city: "This movement appears
' to have been conceived in error and bom of ignor
-1 ance of the real needs of California and the irrigation
situation in the West."
We believe that the real need of California and the
irrigation situation in tlte West is a need of more
v.-3ter for irrigation, and that it be had as quickly as
possible.
The Times favors an irrigation system unfiertaken
and carried out and administered by the Federal
Government at the expense of the national treasury.
This scheme has its origin in the Territories, where
the people are accustomed to pray toward Washing
ton for what they want
In the recent session of the National Irrigation
Ccnsrress at Missoula, in Montana, ex-Governor Mc-
Cord of Arizona was selected to state this Territorial
aspiration. He is reported in the Times to this ef
fect: "State ownership he opposed as being liable
to bring about great abuses. He advocated eloquently
and warmly a national system of irrigation as the
most reasonable and logical of a:: systems. The edu
cation of the people of the East is the first thing to
be accomplished. They must be brought to under
stand the real significance of this reclamation of a
vast empire of measureless possibilities." No one in
California has any objection to this missionary move
ment to convince the Eastern land-owners that the
Western lands should be improved at their expense to
become their competitors. It is an altruistic age. and
the Eastern grain-raiser, who often sells his crop at
less than the cost of production, may be educated up
to the point of enlarging the mortgage on his land to
pay for a national irrigation system which will in
crease the product of the Western grain-raiser. Cali
fornia has no objection to such a test of rural unself
ishness. Bnt while this educational movement is in
progress the f.cod waters of this State are running to
waste nd the land they should irrigate lies untilled
and fruitless. The gentlemen who have called the
coming convention in .... and ignorance" are
of the opinion that if we wait for the East to be edu-'
ted up to doing something for us, in the time re
quired to do it California will have lost enough to
have constructed several times over the needed reser
voirs for storage. It is a simple economic question.
Having the power to save this waste water and make
fruitful this waste land, and make California the one
spot or. earth that suffers no loss from flood or
droueht, shall we use that power for our own bine
-
fit or wait for somebody to do it for us?
The situation of this State is peculiar. The other
States and Territories this side the one hundredth
meridian, which need irrigation, have certain inter
state problems which they cannot settle for them
selves. Streams head in one ..... flow
through one or more other jurisdictions. This is the
case with the Arkansas, Xorth Platte, Snake. Colo
rado, Bear, Yellowstone, Columbia. Rio Grande and
ether streams.- which carry the drainage and water
the land of more than one State. The several inter
ests involved, and in the case of the Rio Grande they
are international as well as .-â  are irreconcil
able by single State action. They of necessity im
pinge upon Federal authority, which must take the
seat of judgment at some stage of the' issues arising
in the use of their floods or their normal flow. In
California this is not the case. Our flood waters are
poured from the clouds on our own fountains; they
drain back to their source in the ocean through our
streams. The harm they do is to us. Their potential
good is for us, and when we take it no one is de
spoiled. It is the opinion of Governor JvlcCord that
a State effort will be subject to many abuses. When
was Federal effort free from them? When was any
Government effort insured against abuses? The State
of Xew York owns a canal system. It made Xew
York City the business and financial center cf the
...... its administration has never been free
from abuses. The Federal Government carries tHe
mails, but that .function has never been free from
abuses, as -the Star route frauds stand to testify.
After the Eastern farmer has been educated up to
spending his money to make the Western farmer'-s
land fertile, and the Federal Government acts as his
almoner, there will be abuses, but they will not con
cern the present generation of men, for they will be
buried in soil so dry- ... will nullify the hope of
resurrection, for it won't raise anything.
The Times fears that if California help herself the
West will be weakened and its missionary effort will
wane. This -is an unjustifiable fear. The members of
Congress from this State ".vill not hold back in urg
ing any Federal irrigation policy that will help our
neighbors. We do not say that such policy is
"conceived in error and born in ignorance," for
hard words irrigate no land. We will mit that, like
faith, it is the evidence of things unseen, the sub
stance of things hoped for.
But California need "not wait for those things to
come. She can gird her loins and go out and fetch
them That is what the convention of Xovember 14
is for, and to its deliberations the disciples of Fed
eral irrigation by missionary effort are invited.
Aguinaldo is posing as the Lucius Junius Brutus of
his race. His brother Baldomero is imprisoned at
Filipino headquarter^ and will soon be shot for trea
son, his offense having consisted of the embezzlement
of moneys from the insurgent treasury. Aguinaldo de
clares that he will not interfere to prevent the execu
tion of sentence. *
THE PROBLEMS OF THE MINERS.
rROM every point of view it is gratifying that
efforts have been put forth to make the annual
mining convention in San Francisco this year
something more than a State assembly. The
problems of Western miners are many, and as most
of them are as important to one Western or Pacific
Coast State or Territory as to another, it is desirable
they be discussed by representative men from
all sections of the Greater West so that there may be
unify of action in carrying out any line of policy that
may be deemed advisable.
Among the larger issues to be dealt with by the
convention are the revision and codification of Fed
eral mining laws, the conservation of water, "the pro
curement of appropriations from the Federal Govern
ment for the construction of restraining -dams, and
the promotion of the movement begun some time
ago to bring about the creation by the National Gov
ernment of a department of mines and mining, to be
under the direction and control of an official of Cab
inet ink.
Such issues affect the whole of the Greater West,
] and it is desirable they be considered as broad na
; tional problems rather than as local questions. The
j efforts made to procure a general representation of
1 other mining States and Territories have met with
; good success. It has been announced that the Gov
; ernors of Colorado. Xew Mexico, Idaho and Wash
i iugton had last week reported the appointment of ten
j delegates each, and all the other Western Governors
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, OCTOJBER 17, 1899.
] will undoubtedly respond in time. Each executive
I was asked to name representative men who would
\ really attend the convention, and it is hoped there
1 will be many delegates from other States who will
I Jeter be active at home in promoting the policies
j agreed upon.
The time is propitious for the mining States of the
j West to act with success in promoting the measures
| necessary to their interests. Public pinion has now
I been fully awakened to the importance of the
j problem of conserving the water supply and of pro
jecting the streams and the valleys by the construc
| tion of impounding dams. So also much has been
done to form a sentiment in favor of a revision of the
| mining laws and of establishing a department of the
j Government to administer the affairs of the vast in
dustry of mining.
'The war in the Transvaal is going to turn in this
direction the attention of mining capitalists seeking
investments. Whether they invest or not will be
largely determined by the legislation and other con
ditions under which mining is carried on in this
countiy-. It is timely, therefore, to remedy a.! abuses
that may exist in the laws and to give such assistance
as is expedient to promote the mining enterprises cf
the nation. A convention^ representing the great
mining States of the Union can do much to ac
complish these desired ends, and for that reason the
approaching gathering in this city will be noted with
more than ordinary interest throughout the whoie re
gion west of the Missouri.
T. on Satur
day evening to ratify the Republican mu
nicipal ticket was a conspicuous success
and an incident of great significance. The
sound and temperate address of Hon. Horace
Davis was a keynote from its opening salute
to its -st word. It supplied, from a source
of unquestioned integrity, _ group of facts that had
been obscured by the intemperate utterances of Mr.
! Pheian and his supporters. The new charter, from
I its inception to its ratification by the Legislature,
! continually depended upon Republican favor, in
.l fiuence and votes for its installation as the organic
i law -of the city. It would have been beaten i.: the
i polls except for the votes given to it in Republican
j strongholds. It was adopted by a Republican Legis
lature, wherein the right of home rule was recog
; nized. The new primary law, which Mr. Pheian says
j was a necessary adjunct of the charter, was intro
! duced by a Republican Senator and passed by a Re
! publican Legislature. The Republican party having
| done its full share in securing reform in the funda-
I mental law of San Francisco, having become re
! sponsible therefor by Republican votes without which
< the opposition in Democratic strongholds would have
j beaten it, and having accepted final responsibility
| for it in a Republican Legislature,- is now denounced
j by Mr. Phelan as not to be trusted to organize the
(government which is to issue from it)
Saturday night's meeting distinctly repudiated this
I assumption and was the party's declaration that the
I law it made it intends to administer. Having the
I votes, and being represented by a ticket which com
mands ... confidence of every* independent voter in
the city, and that has the enthusiastic support of
every Republican who feels the impulse of his civic
responsibility, the Republican party appeals with con-
I fidence to the conscience of every well-wisher of the
ary.
The speech of Hon. Horace Davis was the utter
j ance of a man who appreciates the solemn responsi
i bility of public authority, and who approaches its
assumption with no ambition other than its faithful
administration. Xo longing for the dress parade,
common to men who make spectacular use of one
position that it may be a stepping-stone to another, is
found in his address. It is the speech of a business
man who knows keenly the relation between good
j government and the prosperity af the people.
As a business man he. believes that a municipal
corporation is a business organization, to be run on
business principles. Its officers are chosen by a ma
jority of its . ... directors and agents, to
manage its affairs. As a majority of the voters in
this city are unquestionably in favor of the ideas and
policy of Mr. Davis, it would be an act of folly to
elect Mr. Phelan, who does not represent either the
politics or the municipal policy of that majority.
GENERAL BULLER. after his appointment as
commander in chief of the British forces in
South Africa, went according to custom to take
official leave of his sovereign, .nd when her Majesty
impressed upon him her dislike of war and her desire
for its speedy termination, he is reported to have at
tempted to reassure her by saying, "The war wiil be
troublesome but not dangerous."
Allowance is to be made for the circumstances
under which the general spoke. -He could hardly
have said anything else to a man and a Queen ab
horrent of war and eager for a return of peace. It is
quite probable, however, the general really meant
what he said. Despite the disastrous experiences of
Majuba Hill and other conflicts with the Boers, there
is a strong belief among the British that the success
of the 'â â â â  7- in those engagements was due more to
bad management on the part of the British com
manders than to any extraordinary excellence of the
Boers themselves. Predictions have been made in
London that the war will be ended within three
months after the British forces are ready to take the
aggressive.
Men who have lived in South Africa, however, take
a different view. For example, Tames Say, ex-chair
man of the Rand Stock Exchange, is quoted by a
London paper as having said just before the Outbreak
of hostilities: "Great Britain, if she goes to war. will
begin the worst day's work for herself in her history.
South Africa would ttirn the country- into a hell for
years to come. Every Boer is ready to fight, and the
women are fiercer than the men. If the Boers are
once defeated Johannesburg will be razed and the
gold mines destroyed. It will cost Britain $75,000,000
for new machinery alone. Miiner's has been a sad,
mad policy."
A race of men and women of. that character, oc
cupying a large and sparsely settled country compara
i tively inaccessible, can prolong a war almost indef
initely and make it costly and dangerous for an in
j vading foe. no matter how much stronger the foe
! may be in numbers, discipline and military stores.
The Boers, accustomed to border warfare, will not
j rush in fanatic folly to slaughter as did the dervishes
Jat Omdurman. They will resort to even.- strategy
I their skill can devise and make full use of every ad
j vantage the wild nature of their country affords. Vic
j toria is growing old and she may not live to see the
end of the conflict her general so jauntily told her
would be "troublesome but not dangerous."

THE TICKET RATIFIED.
BOERS AS FIGHTERS.
DISTRIBUTION OF THE WATERS OF OUR STATE.
Here ! s the Opinion of a Man Who Has Spent Forty-Four
Years Studying the Problem.
EDITOR THE CALL: In your issue of September.3o you have a very excellent
article on "Trade and Irrigation." in which you Indorse The proposition
to invoke the aid of the State govern tto impound the flood water _ and
thereby irrigate every available acre and bring It into action. I have
spent the best years of my life In the endeavor to do this same thing, hav
ing commenced to write on It as early as USS, and to make surveys at raj .own ex
pense as early as 1554, and have taken an active part In every phase, of the qt.ies
tion since then, but I have learned something, and one of the most important
things 1 have learned is that the habits and practices of a people cannot o<=
changed in a day. and that all things are subject to the slow processes ox v kj-
LUTION. Did you know that as a fact. If you should fix every f * m ,?,â_."
fornia for the water and put it at the highest point on the land, with noin, â¢
do but to open a gate, aad let the water run. there would not be one in _ xt a m
the present farming population who would use it and that not one acre (in a
hundred would be watered? Did you know as a fact that there Is: now on *â 
infinitesimal portion of the available water used for irrigation? The gen., em en
who are forming the society for the purpose of promoting the storage oi Â£Â»"Â«Â£
by the State mean well, but they are putting the cart a long ways ahead .me
horse; they have not been through the mill. They are good, earnest men, ano . -i
their efforts were turned in the proper channel they might do some Keoa.
Looking over the list it seems that most of them are good business men, ana i ii
either one of them owned a large tract of land that needed irrigation he wouia not
build expensive reservoirs before ie had utilized the one-hundredth part or tne
water available without the expense. If you should ask anyone of thes ?f *"" Jâ¢*;"
if he would not utilize the available water first he would tell you unhesitating^
that he would. Then If he had tenants who would not use what was running
by their doors would he insist on spending a whole lot of money to S et â¢ O J.Â® Vi r
them? If he would not, then why ask the State to spend the money for reser
voirs until her people learn to use what tney have? I have been consiaerea a
crank on irrigation for the last forty years, and am just as enthusiastic on in
subject as ever, and would not for my right hand throw cold water on an. â¢o\e
that might lead up to good results, but there are some earnest men in tnis move
who wish to do good to the State, md who do not want to inaugurate a mo\e I,jr
the mere purpose of giving some one a chance to talk.
Look at the Sacramento Valley with the great river running through it.
Look at the c-rec-ks and rivers running into it on both sides! Enough to irrigate
every acre of its five thousand square miles of magnificent land! How much or it
is used? Not twenty-five square miles is irrigated. Go on up the ban Joaquin
Valley and what portion of the watecs of the Cosumne, the Mokelumne, the Ca.a
veras, the Stanislaus, the Tuolumne, the Merced, the San Joaquin, the Kings, tne
Kern and numerous other streams heading in the eteraal snows of the Sierras are
utilized? Do the waters of these streams serve one acre in fifty that they ought
to serve? There is some attempt to use some of the waters of the Kings and
Kern rivers, but owing to the utter lack of laws for the proper distribution of
the water nothing like the full capacity is reached. Now if all this land be
longed to any one of the business men who are talking about forming a society for
the purpose "of getting the State to build reservoirs, and all the people were ten
ants, don't you think he would teil them to make a beginning on the water run
ning to waste past their doors before he would undertake to spend millions of
money in reservoirs?
When we get across the ridge into "Southern California" we find but little
land fit to cultivate and but little water. The people were forced to begin to
use it, and as they could not take any pride in advertising "fruit grown
without irrigation," the process of evolution had to take faster steps
tban up porth and they are ready for that system of reservoirsâ that is if
they can find any water with which to fill them! They have not felt down
there so much the want of a law for the distribution of the water as they have
up north, because the water was nearly all developed water, or water In streams
so small that it made distribution comparatively easy. Just what might be done
with reservoirs there I am not prepared to say. but I believe not much in com
parison to the cost. Better let people get on to land that can be Irrigated without
so much cost. When we have made available all the water that may be picked
up cheap, the State will have a rural population of two or three millions, and.
the reservoirs will then come. Â». Jâ¢;
What we most need is some proper law for the distribution of water that will
be sustained by the people and the courts.
We first had the riparian contest, and that was followed by the district law.
The district law may not be perfect in all Its details, but it is correct in prin
ciple, and there can be no thorough distribution of water without bringing into
operation the essential principles of the law. For the mere verbiage I am will
ing to "let fools contest." It is now fashionable to rail against the district law,
but suppose we had a reservoir in every canyon in the mountains, how would
the people get it without a law regulating distribution, and in that law every
land-owner must have equal rights and every one be made to pay; all the rest
is detail. â¢
The discussions at the several irrigation conventions beginning about 1??4; the
fight over the district bill introduced in 1285 and the discussions that naturally
followed brought about a furor in favor of irrigation, and when a district law
did pass in ISST there was a rush in the formation of districts. Some were
formed in the southern part of the State on worthless land for the sole pur
pose of selling bonds, and in some cases bad judgment was shown, and in none
was there unanimity. These all put bonds on the market. Briefless lawyers
found in the dissensions a chance to make fees, and what were called the "kick
ers" were encouraged to begin suits. Boon a "Protective League" was formed
that fought all districts and all bonds. As no paper can be sold under fire the
work all along had to stop. The Turlock district in Stanislaus County, under the
general direction of Judge James A. Waymire, did pull along, and under fire for
ten years did get water. t ;
Columns of detail might be brought forward to show that the district sys
tem did not have a fair test, but It ls simply the desire now to call the attention
of the gentlemen who propose to form a storage society to the fact that the great
matter In hand is DISTRIBUTION! W. S. GREEN.

VOICE OF THE PRESS.
That Damaging Bryan Letter.
Ukiah Republican Press.
The San Francisco Call publishes whr.t purrorts to be a fac simile of a let
ter written June 11, :â â _>, by William J. Bryan to J. Sterling Morton, both men
being residents of Nebraska. Mr. Bryan was at that time a candidate for
secretary of the Railroad Commission of his State. He is accused of writing
to Mr. Morton, "1 assure you that it is the monay that is in the office and net
the nor that attracts me." The letter appears to be genuine in every respect
and Mr. Morton, who is said to have receive 1 it, was Secretary of Agricultute
under President Cleveland, lt is a very remarkable declaration to com* from
a man who has received the consideration that has been shown Mr. Bryan
The Call gives the letter all possible prominence and vouches for its authen

Examiner's Faked Interviews.
Stockton Independent.
The Examiner published a Hot of alleged Interviews with officers of the
Twentieth Kansas Volunteers criticising General Otis and in the next day's
Chronicle all the officers repudiated tie statements of the Examiner. Some of
them decared that they had not talked with a reporter at all and others de
clared the published interviews pure fakes. In one instance the alleged portrait
of the officer was published and that proved to be a fake, was not his picture
at all and he had rot even talked with the reporter. General Funston was to
dignant at the misrepresentations of him and repudiated the alleged inter
view as a whole. . This merely illustrates the methods to which the Examiner
stoops in carrying out its spites. It cannot be believed In the commonest mat
ters. Its reporters cannot be believed because they have strings on them. Why
should It not require a Government license to practice wholesale lying? Ab
solute prohibition of falsehood would be too severe on the yellow journals. It
would amount to virtual confiscation of some valuable properties. But a tax
of two bits a line on self-evident lying would yield a larger revenue in San
Francisco than the levy of the Supervisors.

The Marconi System.
Springfield Leader-Democrat.
It would seem that the crowning event of the nineteenth century along Â»he

telegraphy. The best illustration of its utility as well as its practicability has
been given by the inventor in reporting the international yacht races beWeen

Future of Wireless Telegraphy.
San Diego Union. .
Wireless telegraphy showed its possibilities at New York the other day
when it was able to send from the ocean a denial of the cruel rumor that the
steamer Grand Republic had sunk with all on board. The incident *UÂ£ree<ts
the thought that the time is not far distant when every ocean Â«teame ; will
have a wireless telegraph connection with the 'and and thus be able to commu
nicate at a': hours the vessel's exact position. There seems no limit to tr7Â«
achievements of invention in these times. " ._""Â»

THE GAME OF PEDRO-Several in

A lid and bought. One of the players
discards -pedro of trumps and six of
trumps. B picked them up. A claims
that the points should go to the pitcher
and that B had no right to pick them up
Is that correct?" Answerâ There is no
discard in pedro. In draw pedro, that is
probably what the inquirer means,, when
a player discards, the discard should ne
turned face up, and before giving tbe
player a draw, the dealer should see that
the player has not discarded, any point
trump. Should point trumps be dis
carded, the player is compelled to taKe
them back. After a lead has been mad*:-.
however, it is too late to take action.

t^ose Political Friend of President
Tells of His Impressions
of the Present Sit
uation.
Herman H. Kohlsaat, proprietor of the
Chicago Times-Herald, spent yesterday
familiarizing himself with San Francisco
and extending his acquaintanceship.
Mr. Kohlsaat Is, perhaps, next to Sen
ator Hanna, the nearest persona] and
political friend of President McKinley.
Kohlsaat, In fact, entered journalism
la re ely 'for the purpose of advancing
AVilliam McKinley's political ambitions.
He had been trained to commercial life
and had grown wealthy when he became
enamored of McKinley's" personality and
political principles and purchased the
Times-Herald to boom his friend's am
bitions.
Mr. KolbJsaafs newspaper Is regarded
us the most Influential in the Republican
party in the Central West. It was Mr. I
Kolhsaat who forced the last Republican '
National Convention to Insert the word
â¢'gold in its platform. This he sue- |
ceeded In doing over the protest of such
a prominent personality as Mark Hanna. j
"I am merely on a tour of rest and '
recreation," said Mr. Kohlsaat to a rep
resentative of The Call yesterday. "I
am desirous of witnessing personally the
marvelous development of the Pacific ;
Coast. 1 am glad to see that the Pacific
("oast, like the Central West and the
East and the old North, is flourishing.
'J he country is undergoing an unpar- !
nheled period of prosperity. It would be
â¢iiillcult to find a closed factory or a
smokeless furnace anywhere between the j
Pacific and the Atlantic.
"Yes," said Mr. Kohlsaat in reply to a
question, 'I believe the policy and states
manship of McKinley has much to do with
existing prosperity. I have not a doubt of
McKinley's imination by his party
a:.d re-election by the people. I don't
think there will be any opposition to him
In the National Convention. There may j
be a few plots like Foraker and a
few disappointed otlice-seekers of an- j
other breed to Insinuate discontent, but
I feel assured that McKinley's triumph
ln the convention will be to all intents
and purposes unanimous.
"Secretly," continued Mr. Kohlsaat, I
"the conservative men of the South will
admit that while they intend to vote for j
the Democratic candidate, they hope and
believe ihat McKinley will be re-elected. :
The Southern Democrats can enjoy pros- i
perity as ell as the Northern and West
ern Republicans. 1 think and predict that
McKinley will be re-elected President by |
the largest majority ever registered in
the Electoral College.
"Free coinage is played out. There is '
nothing In it any more. The country is
even inpatient with the sound of the
words as well as with the idea. Mr. ;
Bryan still flourishes as a talker, but he j
makes no converts.
"I do not believe that McLean will be ',
elected Governor of Ohio. I have heard I
the suggestion that Foraker was secretly
in league with McLean, and I have no \
cause to doubt It . but raker cannot
mako Governors nor Presidents nor Sen- I
ators. !
"I don't think the administration ls tak
ing any special interest ln the question of
th.c vacant Senatorshlps. i have never
heard Mr. McKinley say what he thought
on the disputed question of the right of
the Governor to appoint a Senator when
the Legislature failed to elect. I don't
think the President is bothering with the
matter. He has enough of other things
that he must attend to to keep him busy."
Mr. Kohlsaat will remain here until
Thursday, and may make a tour of the
State. Since his arrival in San Francisco
he has received much social attention.

SISTER JULIA THERESA

terhood.

An interesting feature of the exercises
was the singing of "Joy Bells" by the ju
venile chorus, numbering seventy-five of
the smallest pupils. The "Jubilee Greet
ing," by the vocal classes was charming
ly rendered, and In fact the musical num
bers reflected great credit on both teach
ers and pupils.
A rama in three acts entitled "The Ju
bilee" followed, and all the characters
were weii sustained. The tableau and al
legorical pictures were beautiful and the
daintily gowned young ladies earned the
unstinted applause of the audience, both

and the histrionic ability tney displayed.

ODD FELLOWS GATHER
FOR A GREAT JUBILEE
Several Days of
Festivity in San
Franciscobythe
Order.
LAST evening there was unusual ac
tivity in the Odd Fellows' building,
which was filled with visiting mem
bers of the order who during the
day had come from the interior to
be present during the jubilee celebration.
There was an informal reception which
was under the auspices of the patriarchal
branch of the order and it consisted mere
ly of Introducing the visitors to the mem
bers of the executive committee that has
charge of the festivities during the week.
Hundreds upon hundreds of members of
subordinate lodges, delegates to the Grand
Encampment and Rebekahs were made
acquainted with each other and all were
Jubilant in the thought that San Franclsco
Odd Fellows will have a Jubilee worthy of
the name and a credit to the order.
To-day the Grand Encampment will
hold its first business session and there
will be present a greater number of mem
bers of that branch of the order than
there has ever been ata any Grand En
campment. During the day the hundreds
who are coming by excursion trains from
all sections will be received at the depots
by the reception and hotel committees,
who will extend to them every courtesy to
make their stay here a pleasant one.
In the evening there will be an exempli
fication of the three degrees, the Patri
archal, Golden Rule and Royal Purple, by
picked teams before the Grand Encamp
ment In the assembly hall of the Odd Fel
lows* building. There will also be an ex
emplification of the work of the Rebekah
branch.
The Odd Fellows, the Rebekahs and the
Patriarchs Militant are coming to this
city in large numbers from all parts of
the State to take part In the grand cele
bration in commemoration of the semi
centennial of Odd Fellowship in Califor
nia.
Yesterday temporary headquarters were
opened in the assembly hall of the Odd
Fellows' building, and there were mem
bers of the reception and information
committees to extend the hand of fel- .
lowshlp to the strangers and give them
all the information possible.
During the day a force of men were
putting on the finishing touches on the
electric display on the Odd Fellows' build
ing. On the Market street front there
is on the line of the floor of the second
Story a string of colored lights in fes

two ladles, or two ladies. There has been
such a demand for invitations that the
executive committee was forced to adopt
that rule so as to prevent overcrowding.

The excellence of Syrup of Figs is due
not only to the originality and simplic-
ity of the combination, but also to the
care and skill with which it is manu-
factured by scientific processes known
only to the California Fig Syrup Co.,
and therefore we wish to impress on all

New Head of the University of Cali
fornia Is Made the Guest of
Honor at a Delight
ful Eunction.
The medical faculty of the University
of California gave a dinner in the con
servatory of the Palace Hotel last, night
In honor of President Benjamin Ide
Wheeler. Over fifty guests were present.
Besides Dr. Wheeler the entire staff of
the university was present as the guests
of the medical faculty, who improved the
occasion not only to honor their new
president but to bring into close and
friendly relation the different branches of
learning in California's "-great seminary.
At the head of the table sat Dr. A. A.
d'Ancona, toastmastor of the evening,
with Professor Wheeler at his right hand
and Dr. R. Beverly Cole seated on his
iell. jNexi to Ur. Cole -Was seated Pro
fessor Le Conte.
When the black coffee had appeared
and the perfectos had been lighted Dr.
d'Ancona arose and in a well rendered
speech spoke of the object of the dinner,
or' the distinguished gentleman who was
the guest of honor, and the history of the
Berkeley University. In concluding Dr.
d'Ancona called upon Dr. Cole to re
spond.
This Dr. Cole did in his usual happy
vein.
Following Dr. Cole came Professor
Wheeler, who delighted his audience with
lan impromptu address which was as
| witty as it was interesting, dignified and
manly in its strong common sense and
! honest delivery.
Briefly Professor Wheeler said he was
I the same Wheeler that he had been in
j the East. He had come out to the coast
j with no new-fangled Ideas, with no new
notions. It would be his endeavor to
make the university what the people oÂ£
California wanted it to be, not only the
foremost place of learning in the State
but unsurpassed by any in the country.
He. would do his best to bring the medi
cal department and the university proper
into closer relationship with each other.
He knew that the work was one which
was almost too much for one man, but
with the help of all lt could be accom
plished. ;.
I After Dr. Wheeler others spoke and the
' younger members punctuated the fre
'. quent bursts of applause with the old
college yell. The dinner was a most suc
cessful and happy affair, and when the
hour came for the guests to depart it was
with regret that each left.

are pleasant to the taste: but the me-
dicinal properties of the remedy are
obtained from an excellent combina-
tion of plants known to be medici-
nally laxative and to act most
beneficially.
As the true and original remedy
named Syrup of Figs is manufactured
by the California Fig Syrup Co, only, a
knowledge of that fact will assist in
avoiding the worthless imitations man-
ufactured by other parties. The high
standing of the California Fig Syrup
Co. with the medical profession, and
the satisfaction which the genuine

Its remedy.

" COM PAUL"
CORRIGAN IS
TROUBLED
Hoping Against Hope to Open
Ingleside â Will the Law
Be Violated?
While the howling, shrieking winds
raised iho shingles from the partially con
structed grandstand, and the raindrops
large as ostrich eggs washed away the
track at Tanforan i'ark. "Oom Paul" Cor
rigan and bis colleagues, so rumor says,
have been playing checkers. Corrigan's
new track at San Bruno, in the county
of San Mateo, reached by a beautiful
drive over roads wild and rocky, and
through a picturesque region inhabited
by the cabbage and the billy goat, is
hilled to open on November 5. Notwith
standing ; he sincere protestations of Sec
retary Greene that everything will be in
readiness to throw open the gates on
that occasion, it is a ell known fact that
such a thing is almost an utter impos
sibility. Ram has greatly retarded the
working force, and visitors to the scene
of the new racing operations say '<-
i-ember 5 would more hi the opening date,
if even then it is ready.
.Now. so report says, comes the fine
move from the, king row of "Oom Paul"
Corrigan. The Western Turf Association,
i he heavily veiled organization controlling
Tanforan Park. never dreamed of open
ing on the date set. Ingleside track has
suddenly assumed a busy air. It is closed
by the law, but Corrigan] whose tilings
at Springfield, 111., lailed to keep open
Hawthorne track in Chicago, two years
back, is going to talk in San Francisco.
The walks are being brushed up, the
cooking kitchen put in order, the betting
ring swept up and the law is to be out
raged and â¢transgressed.
The Board of Supervisors is to be ap
pealed to in beseeching terms. All the
Western Turf Association wants is- per
mission -...-. Ingleside track for Iwo
weeks, or until Tanforan Park is com
pleted. Certainly, on the face of it.
this i.-; a very mild plea; but the joker re
mains in the background. Once allowed
to reopen, the ordinance has been violated
by consentâ then how can the track be
closed again? It is said that the "break
water" will be the innocent little meet to
be held In the near future of the Golden
Gate Driving Club. Only five or six
races; with uorscs to be driven by gentle
men drivers, wit ii only a few little inno
cent pool tickets to be passed around.
Only a loophole for "Oom Paul" Corri
gan to show bow the law can be beat, and
the Western Turf Association will have
Its opening at Ingh side track.
It cannot be possible that Mayor Phelan,
tbe learned jurors who comprise the bar
of nur city and the hoi Table men com
prising the Board of Supervisors, who
passed the ordinance condemning Ingle
side with its damning influences, can be
hoodwinked by this bombastic Chicago
horseman. It behooves the Mayor of
San Francisco to see that the law is en
forced.
CALIFORNIA BAND CONCERT.
Musicians of the First Volunteer
Regiment Play for the Red
Cross Benefit.
The band of the First California Volun
teers inaugurated a week of concerts and
receptions at -tlte Alhambra Theater last
night*? The boys did not receive th re
ception that their playing and the enter
tainment they offered deserved. Tliis is
explained in a measure from iii- fact that
Mrs. Townsend had purchased all the un
sold scats in the house and sent them to
th.' Montana and Kansas regiments,
neither of which could attend.
There was much thai was commendable
in the playing t.i the band. Few musical
organizations that have appeared in pub
-11 â¢ in the city surpass it. Every num
ber of a well arranged programme "was re
ceived with unstinted applause and unani
mous approval. While the band was the
star attraction there was just enough of
variety to prevent monotony. Mrs. Eva
Tenney, the contralto soloist, contributed
several very charming numbers. Her
rendition of "Beside the Pasig River,"
the words of which are by Sol X. Sheri
dan and the music by 'A. Ison Adams,
bader of the band, was especially lino and
called for prolonged applause.
One of the features of the programme
was the exhibition of views taken by the
United States Volunteer Signal Corps. It
is the most complete set of Philippine
pictures yet shown here and gives a vivid
idea of the terrors of war.
The concerts are to be repeated every
night this week and there will be a
matinee Saturday. The proceeds are to
be given to the lied Cross Society.

DUFFY FELL
HEIR TO A
GREAT KICK
His Ride on Wyoming. Did
Not Please â Four Beaten
Choices at Oakland.
Once in trouble always suspected.
Jockey Frank Duffy caused no small
amount of adverse criticism at Oakland
yesterday by finishing beyond the money
with Wyoming, the even money choice,
for the third event Perhaps Thorpe, or
possibly Spencer, could have been beaten
'n the same manner and nothing would
have lien said. Then, again, it could be
supposed that Duffy was not trying with
the horse!" The "kicker" said that one
or two pencilera laid against Galen
Brown's horse. N This may be true, but
on Saturday one bookmaker in particular
took in a raft of coin on Lavator, and the
sprinter walked in. So much for that
argument. As it happened, Wyoming
acted none too prettily at the post, and
eventually got away seventh â or lust.
Right nere Duffy made. a queer move; he
appeared to take his mount back. There
alter he rode a nice race, matting up lost
ground gradually, and in the fail nome
it lodkea as it he might be second. Loss
than a furlong from the wire, Polish,
with Frawlej up, Swerved perceptibly,
causing Duffy, astride the favorite, to
ease up, and come through on the inside,
in the deep going. He finished fourth, i
Don't Know, noden by Mart*) Bergen,
won comfortably by over a length, with
Polish second, a length ahead of Rio
hico. The ride on tne favorite did not
suit the talent, and was investigated by
the stand.
The track next the rail was deep with
mud, and the speckled going caused the
downfall of four favorites. Like all open
ing days of the week, the attendance was
large. Ruiz carried off the riding honors
by piloting two winners.
Gauntlet made nis initial appearance
tins season in the opening event, at six
furlongs, and was installed a 1 to a favor
ite. lie loomed up in the front position
to the bend tor the stand, but when chal
lenged by Duffy, on Tiburon, grew groggy
ana was led out a length. Rainier dis
posed of The Offering for show honors.
Formeiia, it seems, has severed her con
nection with Klmwood Farm, appearing
yesterday in the colors of Merckel & Co.
,he mare had her price pounded down
from 8 to 5 to 11 to 10 and won cleverly.
She did not fancy the damp spots, but
on striking the dry going in the stretch;
pulled away, beating out Starling with
something to spare. San Carlos took the
show from Shannonette, a leo to 1 out
sider.
By good horsemanship ' Ruiz got home
first on Glen Anne in the fourth recital,
a mile run, decided under selling condi
tions. The St. Andrew mare ran a good
race, but was fortunate with all. Ridden
with better Judgment, Reolia could have
scored. At the start Mounce, on the lat
ter mare, stepped off the first quarter In
the deep going, accompanied by Rapido.
He then tried to make a runaway race
of it. but his mount was all out when the
stretch was reached, although finishing
third. Sorrow, at odds of 12 to 1, looked a
winner up to the last few yards, when she
was nabbed and downed a short head on
the wire by Glen Anne. It was one of
the best pieces of saddle work Ruiz has
â¢ shown.
Ruiz also displayed his ability to notice
able advantage in the seven furlong handi
cap, last on the card. He straddled So
cialist, the second choice, and In a nose
finish took the decision from Ringmaster.
Many considered the latter horse the best,
but still the winner was under restraint
for the greater portion of the trip. Im
perious, the favorite, could not last out,
after making the pace, landing in the
show.
Track Notes.
Joseph A. Murphy, who arrived from
St. Louis Sunday evening, presided in the
stand at Oakland yesterday. Mr. Murphy
says the St. Louis track enjoyed one of
the most prosperous seasons in the history
of the Fair Grounds Association the past
summer. On Thursday and Saturday, the
handicap days, the elite and fashion of the
Mound City turned out, and he thinks the
running turf greatly in the ascendency.
Charley Thorpe, suffering from neural
gia, was not seen In the saddle. He was
carded to ride Lodestar and Wyoming
among other mounts.
The horses of Carruthers & Shields ar -
rived tit Oakland track Sunday night. The
string is headed by Advance Guard, about
the best two-year-old on the Canadian cir
cuit. Joe Weber is the stable jockey. Jack
Martin, a pigmy who can do. 70 pounds in
the saddle and put up a stiff ride, is also
with the new comers.
The string of Hughey Jones got in from
Chicago last evening. The horses are now
quartered at Oakland track.
Walter Jennings, trainer of the Rancho
del Paso string, was among the spectators.
Briar Sweet and the balance of his horses
are enjoying a rest at Sacramento. Mr.
Jennings says Briar Sweet, generally al
lotted top weight In the handicap, was not
"off" so badly as some people imagine. He
ascribes a few of her defeats to the fact
that Imp early in the game was under
rated.
Rapido bled again in his race yesterday,
and in future his entry will be rejected. *
It Is quite apparent that the way of the
transgressor is a hard one. Some six
weeks ago, while at St. Louis, Joe Murphy
Bays he received a cablegram from the
secretary of a racing association at Auck
land, New Zealand, asking if there were
any objection to Jerry (Shorn accepting
mounts In that faraway country. The an
swer was "decided objection." And now,
thousands of miles, from home and
friends, this colored lad who might have
been a shining light on the turf, still finds
himself a disgraced renegade.
Devin was questioned as to his tardy
showing with Lodestar; and said that he
was unable to do any better. At St.
Louis last summer it appears the lit
tle fellow did not loom up to great
advantage, and after yesterday's
race Judge Murphy told the jockey
that he would have to take the same
chances as other boys: If he was too
timid to ride then he would be set down,
for his Indifferent exhibitions were an in
justice to the public.
The recent snowstorm in the Sierras
drove John Coleman, Ed Purser and their
party to more comfortable diggings. John
ny and Ed were among the passengers on
the ferryboat currying the crowd across
the bay from the track last evening, and
bear stories were thicker than mosquitoes
on the Yukon. Coleman will soon be seen
on the block, and prices are apt to
lengthen.
After the defeat of Wyoming, Duffy was
called in the stand and thoroughly ques
tioned. He said while at the post the
horse refused to take hold of the hit and
also to break. In this statement he was
substantiated by Starter Ferguson. For
getting cut off in the stretch be was not
blamed, Frawley on Polish being at fault.
There seems to be some doubt as to
whether the rider was reinstated, and
Judge Murphy now awaits a reply from
Captain Rces in reference to the same.

The above resolutions were passed
unanimously at a meeting of the execu

Association held last evening in its head
quarters in the Parrott building. Secre
tary Scovern was directed to forward
them to the Park Commissioners and to
also enter'them on the minutes of the or
ganization.
The meeting was called by the chair
man of the committee for the purpose of
discussing the advisability of turning over
the control of the track racing in '.his
State to the National Cycling Association.
At the end of a lively discussion it was
agreed to recommend that course to the
association at its next meeting, the first
Saturday in November. This has long
been contemplated, as it will relieve the
local association from the trouble of is
suing sanctions for track racing and
bring it ln closer touch with the big or
ganization, which has members and rep
resentatives in all but the Southern
States. It is more than probable that the
recommendation of the executive commit
tee will be followed by the association.
The 10-mile annual road race, which
was postponed last Sunday on account of

days before the race. All riders desiring
to compete should notify "Billy" Loos
at once so that the names may be pub

A Belligerent Landlord.
OAKLAND, Oct. 16.â Henry Benson, a
Swede, aged 62 years, and residing at 4530
Grove street, was arrested to-night for an
assault with a deadly weapon, while the

was taken to the Receiving Hospital to
have several ugly scalp wounds, Indicted
with a wine bottle, dressed and sewed up.
One of the wounds required eight stitches.
Kellock is an extra motorman and ow
ing to lack of employment lately was un
able to pay his rent promptly on the 1.-th
inst. To-day he and his wife had been
looking about for less expensive quarters.
Landlord Benson learned of this and
called on the Kellocks this evening while
they were having supper, and. learning of
their intention to move, picked up a wine
bottle on the table and brutally assaulted
Kellock, so the latter asserts. Officer
Keefe was promptly called in and bundled
the irate landlord to the City Prison.
Later, it is said, Mrs. Benson procured a
club and was about to renew the battle
with Mrs. Kellock, but neighbors inter
fered. .

road running from the Bell ranch south

of the county's tools to contractors.

TITIAN, the Nestor of the Italian Renaissance.
By ARTHUR LINCOLN FROTHINGHAM JR., PH.D.
There Ip very little mystery in Titian's
life and practical unanimity as to his art.
lie was the most finished embodiment of
the sensuous aspect of the developed
renaissance of Italy. He was also, on ac
count of his life of ninety-nine years, a
living history of Venetian painting In its
whole period of bloom, lle witnessed both
the dawn and the decline of the golden
age of the renaissance.
Titian's surroundings made him what
be was. Before his day Venetian art had
not come into line with other Italian
schools. The cold, diplomatic, mercan
tile Venetians had loved the gorgeous
side of the ancient art of Byzantine â¢ as
pire; they had not felt the religious emo
tions that accompanied and made possible
the Glottesque art of the rest of Italy.
Superb color-and lack of inner life char
acterized their school of painting until the
middle of the fifteenth century, only a
generation before Titian's birth. It was
then that the Bellini family imported into
Venice some of the results of the study
of the antique, of thfe science of perspec
tive and of the human form and char
acter, that had been transforming the
Tuscan school of the early renaissance.
Still, even under Bellini, the Venetian
school maintained a distinct Individuality.
due to the character of the people and the
atmosphere of the lagoons; it still re
lied upon color rather than upon drawing;
on an appeal to the senses rather than to
the intellect; on texture rather than ac
tion. But the Bellini were still essen
tially devoted to religious or historical
art. They were not destined to be frank
ly psychological and to embody in paint
the dreaminess of the sea haze, the In

that of the new age and his fellowship
with the young men waiting, like himself,
for a leader to pear. Such a leader came
in Giorgione, the. sensuous poet-painter,
tho dreamer of idyls; no older that Titian,
but with that spark of intuition, of
genius, which he lacked. The two young
men became close â'â dates under Gior
gione's material as well as ideal guid
ance. It is at times as difficult to dis
tinguish the contemporary works of these
two young artists as those of the famous
Greek sculptors, Scopas and Praxiteles,
so deeply had Titian become Impregnated
from the stronger spirit. The association
lasted until Giorgione's death; the artistic
dependence never <iuite ended.
Titian was slow in attaining fame. Not
until his 30th year, in 1507, when he as
fisted rgi me in decorating the palace
called Fondaco del Tedeschi, does he seem
to have acquired an independent reputa
tion. On Giorgione's premature death, in
1510, Titian completed a number of his
friend.- unfinished pictures. Almost im
mediately he received his first important
Independent commission, for a series of
sixteen frescoes in the Scuola del Santo
bt Padua. He 'failed to show in them any
Bpeclal proficiency in the style of grand
composition.
All Titian's works up to about 1505 are
religious subjects, not varying fundament
ally from the Bellini and Cima type,
but, soon after, Titian, under Giorgione's
guidance, entered the enchanted sphere of
poetic allegory', where, unlike religious
art, there was no tradition to prevent a
completely original treatment.
After his Paduan work Titian signalized
his return to Venice by a superb "St.
Mark Enthroned Among Saints" (1512),
and then, aspiring to a more public recog
nition of his position, he began, in 1513,
an attempt to dispossess of his monopoly
the aged monarch, Giovanni Bellini.
Titian's appointment as state painter
helped to procure him the favor of his
first great art patron, Alfonso d'Este,
Duke of Ferrara, for whom he painted re
ligious, allegorical and mythological Bub
jects, as well as portraits, for many years.
The famous "Christ and the Tribute
Money" In Dresden was painted for him.
TStlan's male portraits at this time still
had the gentle poetic melancholy of
Giorgione, without the sensuality that had
crept into his female figures. The bearded
man in Munich, and especially the superb
f "Young Man with the Glove" (Louvre),
are 'lie most exquisite of this class, the
most sympathetic of all the master's por
traits. The famous "Flora" (Uffizl) still
retains, with all its sensuousness, some of
the poetry of the past.
Titian soon substituted for the <;iorgi
onesque repose great vehemence of action
â¢ and luxuriance of form. He shows it
in his Bacchanalian series for the Duke
of Ferrara. especially in the superb "Bac
chus and Ariadne" (National gallery), and
in his religious pictures, notably his great
altar piece in the Belle Arti, the "As
sumption of the Virgin," where action
runs riot. The rather theatrical tendency
of these years (1518*30) Is shown in his
painting, "St. Sebastian" (1522), which
Titian himself regarded at the time as his
masterpioce; it reached its climax in his
"Martyrdom of St. Peter Martyr" (1580),
which was quite universally thought to
be his greatest picture, and the first In
stance. where the human figures were
made subordinate to the landscape.
Â» In 1523 Titian secured a seoond powerful
patron. Federlgo Gonzaga, Duke of Man
tua, for whom he produced the masterly
"Entombment" (Louvre), the portraits of
the Duke and Duchess, the superb
"Bella" (Pitt!) and the "Venus" of the
Cfllzi, working steadily for the Duke until
his death ln 1540. He increased his pop
iilarity at home by the spectacular altar
ilece at the Frari (1525), called the "Ma
donna dl Casa Pesaro."
In 1727 a new period in Titian's life and
irt commenced through his association
with the notorious Pietro Aretino, the
most corrupt man of a corrupt age, an.i
with all his high connections and wealth
' me champion blackmailer of history.
During his stay in Venice he found
V. Titian's talents useful and so helped him
to the favor of various Italian potentates,
and especially of Charles V of Spain.
Titian waa perniciously and permanently
affected by Aretino in his art and char
acter, learning to fawn on the great and
to worship money In a way unworthy of
the dignity of the great artist, and learn
ing especially to prostitute his art.
Ten years after the "St. Peter Martyr"
Titian produced another great religious
picture. "The Presentation of the Virgin
In the Temple." which in Its harmonious
and spectacular composition served with
the "Ecce Heine" as a mode] to other
Venetian masters, such as Tintoretto,
and was never surpassed by them. The
princely house of Farnese succeeded (1542)
the Gonzagas as Titian's patrons, and as
Pope Paul ill was a Farnese, Titian was
thus for the first time brought into close
connection with the Papa! Court. The
painter finally, when nearly 70 years old,
traveled beyond the limits of Northern
Italy and went to Home. There he met
the Titan, Michelangelo. The two artists
represented not merely an artistic op
positionâ design versus colorâ an
opposition of character. Michelangelo
was typically strong, independent, puri
tanic; Titian was supple, fawning, lux
urious. There could be no sympathy or
understanding. From the earlier Flor
entine masters with whom Titian then
became a little better acquainted, he re
ceived something; at least. It appears as
if Verrocchio were not foreign to his
"John the Baptist" (Venice) nor Ra
phael to his ceiling picture of "Wisdom"
(S. Marco), nor even Michelangelo to his
"Adam and Eve" (Madrid), all of which
lv painted after his visit to Rome and
Florence.
_ Not long after Titian made an even
greater journey, to the court of Charles
TITIAN (After a Painting by Himself).
V at Ausburg, where he painted one of
his most consummate masterpieces, the
equestrian portrait of "Charles V at the
Battle of Muhlberg" (Madrid). Titian
had now for several years reached the
summit of his ambitions. 11,- was the
favorite of Popes and Emperors and
feared no rival. Yet he never ceased
from nagging for money and from send
ing unordered pictures in hopes of being
well paid. After the death of Charles V
Titian was high in favor with Philip 11,
whom he had more than once painted
while he nvas yet Prince. Perhaps it was
the Influence of Spanish fanaticism grad
ually creeping over him. perhaps it was
the advance of old age; but whatever the
reason may be. we see Titian gradually
returning to religious scenes and treating
them with less triviality and less brutal-
ity. At the same time he does not so
often treat nude figures and mythological
scenes. Aretino was dead; neo-Cathol
icism was supreme. The "Christ Crowned
With Thorns" (Munich) and the "Pleta"
(Venice. Belle Arti), on which the master
was engaged at the time of his death,
are good examples of this kind of pseudo
religious hysteria that formed quite a
lengthy prelude to his death ln 157G, dur
ing the great plague.
The significance of Titian's art lies not
( in drawing or composition, but In coloring.
His drawing was Indifferent, though Mi
chelangelo regarded it as defective. His
ability to compose, at first decidedly sec
ond rate, became excellent, but his large
compositions never were his most charac
teristic piecesâ compositions. Neither
; is Titian suggestive and inspiring in the
j theme or the inner life of his pictures, as
i are so many other great Italian artists.
The delight he does give often but not
alwaysâ almost purely through the col
or sense; ln the landscape, the atmo
sphere, the combinations and gradations
of tone, the play of light, the inwardness
of color. He shows extreme reticence for
! a Venetian in producing his color effects,
I not forcing the note, not making a Haunt
j ing display or technical mastery, nor seek
; ing vivid contrasts. He Is sober and har
j monious, tending more and more as he ad
j vances in years toward a single color
; note, flooding the surface with light and
I obliterating outlines. This makes him at
j last quite an Impressionist, so that to sp
preciate many of his late pictures It is
necessary to obtain the right distance and
focus before the proper effect of color and
form can be understood. At close quar
ters they seem blurred and careless.
But beyond the wonderful coloring
which so often gives just the Intoxication
; of a Venetian evening there was undoubt
edly a vivid power of characterization in
. Titian's art, whether his portraits have
the clear outlines of (he "Young Man
With the Glove." or are Impressionistic
like the "Antiquary Strada." if the mas
ter's art Is perplexing in Its variety of
Stages, it is due to his long life and the
changes In contemporary art; if it is un
even In its quality it is because his laxity
was not proof against the temptation of ;
pot boilersâ and for this his age was more i
ito blame than he was. Certainly the fact
j that his nature was Impressionable has I
made him a radiant reflection of the sen
i buous life of the late Venetian renaissance
â  to a degree that would have been impossi
ble to a more self-poised or solitary
g< nius.

, A. Chesebrough of Williams, Dimond
' & Co., and Robert Chapman of James F.
[ Chapman & Co., are now in New York
' in connection with a couple of lines of
vessels that run between the East and
San Francisco. Chapman & Co. are
agents for the Flint & Co. line, and Wil
: liams, Dimond & Co. for the Dearborn &
' : Co. line. These two big concerns have
amalgamated under the name of Flint,
[ Dearborn & Co. and are to operate steam
ers as well as sailing vessels between New
â¢ York, Honolulu and San Francisco. It is
; in connection with the handling of the
. business of the new line at this end tliat
Messrs. Chesebrough and Chapman are
: in New York.
The new company has been Incorporated
under the laws of New Jersey, and will
eventually operate a steamship line be
tween New York, San Francisco and
Honolulu. Four steamers have already
been ordered for the service by Flint
& Co., of 8500 tons capacity dead weight,
and these boats, it is expected, will be
' in operation about April or May next, j
Meantime, the company will operate sail- j
ing vessels and will, as a matter of fact,
continue to operate sailers in addition ie
steamships; when the demand warrants
it. Flint & Co. owned sixteen large clip- ,
per ships, and took over the business or
i the Sutton Line when Mr. Sutton died j
about four years ago. Dearborn & Co. j
! are a very v. ell known firm In tie- San
j francisco trade, having established tlieir
service in the early 'w's.
The war in Soutn Africa has given an
| Impetus to shipping in this port. Wheat
! win be in demand and shippers are getting
i bold of every available vessel. On Sun- j
day the British ships Sllberhorn, Yolo, |
Austrasia and Pythomene were unchart
ered. Yesterday they were all taken at
â¢ prices ranging from 37s 6d to '6_<>, the
Pythomene getting the latter figure, j
! Practically tne only unchartered vessel i
In port at the present time is the Ameri
can ship Benjamin F. Packard, which ar
. rived from the East a few days ago. The ;
American ship Servia is .use in port, but
she has been purchased by Lewis; Ander
son it Co. and will go into tic- coastwise
trade.
The new schooner Henry Wilson has
been officially measured at Grays Harbor
. : and her tonnage is given as 103 tons net.
Captain Johnson of the Mary and Ida
will command the Henry Wilson.
There has not been much water in Til
lamook Bay of late and vessels have had
considerable trouble ln getting over the
bar. The steamer Luella left here on
September i*> and after discharging In
the bay loaded again for San Francisco.
A big cargo was not put aboard, but even
then the steamer could not get out. Cap
tain Miller finally gave up in despair and
last Saturday the Luella's cargo was dis
charged and Sunday night she sailed In
ballast for Coos Bay to take on a load
of lumber for San Francisco, lt looks as
though Tillamook Bay Is going to be as
bad this year as It was several seasons ;
ago when the steamer Ventura was
! locked up in the bay eighty-two ' days
'and only got out when the winter rains j
I had cutout a new channel.
I Captain Cooper, the well known and pop- j
| ular master of the British ship Royal .
I Forth, is in San Francisc on a visit. His j
| vessel is now at Astoria loading wheat for i
I Europe and the captain has availed him- I
I self of the opportunity to run down here |
I and see his many friends.
Captain Petrie of the British tramp
steamer Westminster, which has been
chartered by the Government as a trans
port, is well known on th,- coast. if"
was here in 1896 as master of fhe British
steamer Linlithgow. That vessel left the
Sound with a large cargo of wheal for
Europe, but off the coast of Guatemala
lost her propeller. She drifted around in
a helpless condition for a long time, but
was finally abandoned in a sinking condi
tion or October '... 1896. Three lays later
the captain and crew landed on the coast
of Guatemala and from there reached
England. This is Captain Petrle's first
visit to the coast since the disaster.
Th.- Westminster was to have carried
horses to Man'la, but the chances are
now that she will carry a load of hay.
The Government has a big lot of horses
at Honolulu and feed for them is very
scarce. Should the Westminster he load
ed with hay she will go direct to Honolulu
and after discharging will come back here
to load mules for the Philippines.
The transport Centennial made a very
successful trip to Honolulu with her load
of horses. Captain Eagles writes thai two
of the animals died on the way and two
di.-d after landing. The balance w re in
good condition. The Honolulu dispatcher
-aid the horses were weak and could
scarcely stand, but that fad was due to
the horses having been so long at sea.
Colonel lluhlln said he was very much
pleased with the condition in which tho
stock wis landed. The Centennial will
come back here for another bad of horses
and the Athenian and Slam will carry
the animals from Honolulu to Manila.
Two transports will in future carry the
horses to the islands, where they will he
given a rest and a chance to get used
to a tropical climate and then two other
vessels will take them on to Manila.
The transport Hancock will go on the
Hunters Point drydock to-morrow. After
being cleaned she will go to the Govern
ment dock and be fitted out for Manila.
The cruiser Newark is to sail to-day for
Manila via Honolulu and Guam. She is
one of the vessels that have been ordered
to join the fleet in Philippine waters.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's Aus
tralia sails to-day for Honolulu with
every Inch of freight space taken and
every pound of freight she can pack
aboard. She lias not as much merchan
dise aboard this trip as last, as mi this
occasion -â¢he has been compelled to carry
enough coal to bring her back from Hon
olulu. Tin re is a dearth of black dia
monds on the islands and the Govern
ment will not give up any of its store.
In consequence vessels have to carry
sufficient fuel to bring them home again
Captain Debney of the Corona is a well
man again and will go out In command
this trip. Captain Gielow, who has been
It: command of the Corona, has taken the
Coos Bay again.
Officer Bailey of the Harbor police will
not forget "Kid" Pastene In a hurry.
Sunday night he had :. broken nose and

CITY'S TRADE
HAS OUTGROWN

Unable to Move Goods
to the Interior.
INCOMING CARGOES BLOCKED

REVIVAL OF BUSINESS FINDS
COMPANY UNPREPARED.
+
Does Not Control Sufficient Rolling
Stock to Handle the Freight
From San Francisco to
Interior Points.
The Southern Pacific Company and the
shippers of Ban Francisco are confronted
with a serious problem, The trade of the
city has outgrown the railroad s equip
ment and the corporation finds itself face
to face with tin fact that it does not con
trol rolling stock enough to move the
merchandise for which the interior of the
State is clamoring. Shipload upon ship
load of Importations consigned to dif
ferent sections of the State are stored in
local wan houses awaiting the railroad's
pleasure. There is no longer a stagna
tion in mercantile affairs. The revival of
trade came on 50 rapidly that the South
ern Pacific Company finds itself unable
to handle the great volume of business
that is being forced upon it by the sud
den and substantial business activity.
The condition Is a serious one and is
lamentably detrimental to the commercial
interests of the city. Within the week
three deep sea vessels laden with com
modities tor interior sections have been
towed away from the Oakland wharf, un
able to discharge their cargoes. When
tney were ready to unbatten their hatches
the railroad officials informed their agents
that they would be unable for many days
to supply them with cars upon which to
transport their goods. The result has
been tnat the ships have been towed back
Into the stream, and as soon as they could
lind a berth on this Bide of the bay they
have discharged their cargoes, whicn have
been carted away to the warehouses.
Gradually the accumulated merchandise
is being moved to its destination. A car
a day to this point and a car a day to
that is the railroad's limit where the con
ditions demand that a dozen cars were
necessary where the railroad was only
able to furnish but one. .â â¢.:-. s
. A prominent shipper states that he sent
a ship to the Oakland railroad's Oakland
wharf last week. It had a thousand tons
of freight for the interior which it was
almost Imperative to ship by Saturday.
When an application was made for cars
the railroad officials threw up their hands
and exclaimed that it would be almost
Impossible to move a pound of the cargo,
for the reason that there was hardly an
available car at their command. They
admitted that trade had revived so rapidly
and Increased In such volume that 'they
were totally unprepared to handle the
NEW ADVERT SEMENTS.

freight that was awaiting shipment to
the interior. The ship was moved to this
Bide of the bay and the railroad was
pleaded with for any rolling stock that
they could possibly put at the disposal
, ot the shipper, and the very best that
they could do was to move the cargo at
the rate of a carload a day, and this to
. the exclusion of a dozen other clamoring
i shippers: At this rate It will take nearly
two weeks for the railroad to move the
* cargo, where ordinarily it should not take
as many days.
The British ship Beacon Rock engaged
a berth at the Oakland wharf last week,
but before she was taken over her agents
were notified that the railroad could not
i move 'a pound of her freieht. and she
| discharged on this side. The British ship
Duchelburn and the German vessel
, Arthur Fitger were tied up at the Oak
i land wharf before their officers learned
that the railroad was unable to handle
their cargoes.'
Shippers look upon the present condi
tion as extremely annoying, and while
, it indicates the rapid approach of bet
ter times much of the advantage to the
city will be lost unless better facilities
I for moving freight are provided at once.
i the consumers of the interior demand It
and the merchants of the city must have
it in order to hold their trade.
CHANGES PLANNED TO
IMPROVE STATION D
BUILDING MUST BE ERECTED ON
THE DOLPHIN.
All the Work Will Be Performed on
One Floor and Mail Dispatch
ing Will Be Expedited.
The Postoffice authorities will request
the Board of Harbor Commissioners to
make certain improvements and changes
in and about the ferry station for the ac
commodation of Postoffice Station D
The plan now Is to have all the postal
service that is centered at the station
carried on upon' one floor. This can be
brought about by the erection of certain
buildings upon the "dolphin." as the
wharf in the rear of the station is called.
The postoffice . proper can then face on
East street and the department will all
be removed from the station and will be
placed upon the "dolphin" in the rear.
Sufficient accommodation will be given
there to provide for future wants of the
j station for years to come.
Some discussion has taken place con
cerning the amount of rent to be paid by
the Postoffice Department for the n-w
quarters. The understanding of at leaÂ«t
one of the Harbor Commissioners is that
i the rent shall not exceed the present fig
ures, the postal authorities having set
forth thai they could not well afford to
pay more. The space on the second
floor of the ferry building, now occupied
by the station, can be rented easily.
Wells-Fargo will not remove from the
present location until Mr. Christeson re
turns. Plans have been drawn of the
new buildings to be erected for Wells-
Fargo, to the south of the ferry building.
I The delay is caused by a promise that
! nothing should be done until Mr. Christe
son returns.
Dogs in the Presidio.
Last week a lady, wife of a member of
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
ts> Animals, was shocked by witnessing
a case of cruelty to a fine setter dog
which was shot, but not killed, by one of
the petty officers at the Presidio. She
complained to the secretary of the so
ciety, who wrote to Colonel H. B. Free
man at the Presidio, asking that all stray
canines on the reservation be turned over
to the society, Instead of being shot in ac
cordance with military orders. Yesterday
the following very satisfactory reply was
received from the colonel: "I will be very
glad to turn over all these strays to you,
and have Instructed the guards "to take up'
all dogs found at large, if they call .ie
caught, and will hold them until we can
notify your people to take them away."
Pacific Traffic Association.
At the meeting in this city, to be held
next Monday, for the formation, of a per
manent Pacific Coast Traffic Association,
a traffic committee will be provided tor
and this committee, in connection with
the executive head of the association, will
have charge of the executive business of
the association. The new committee will
consist of about forty members. San
Francisco, on the basis of one member
of the committee to every ten business
houses Joining the association, will be an
titled to between twenty and thirty mem
bers of the committee.

There Is a continued good demand for Cali
fornia fruits in London, says the Grocers'
Gazette, and prices are unchanged except for i
Pears, which are dearer, and the limited sup
ply of which is becoming more and more ap
parent. A fair business has been done in
BolmonJ both on spot and to arrive, and al
though the pack in the aggregate has been
a very fair one. the probability is that the
market will remain firm, even if lt does not
Improve, as the high cost ot production, com
blhed with the increased cost of tins and high
lreight?, lead to the assumption that sellers
wilt not offer at lower rates than are now
ruling.
Our Foreign Commerce.
Tb.- figures furnished by the Bureau of . Sta
tistics of the Treasury Department show that
the foreign commerce of the I'nited States
for this calendar year will exceed In volume
that of any previous year in the history of
the country, with a slight decrease in the
balance in favor of the I'nited States from
that of 1898. The imports of merchandise- in
September amounted to $70,46L355 and the ex
ports to $110,437,635. Of gold the imports were
$2 572,028 and the exports $1,056,749: of sliver.
imports $2,040,914 and exports $3,622,149. The
imports of merchandise for the nine months

Dried Fruit in Xew York.
The New York Commercial says:
â "Dried lruits, as a rule, have apparently
shaken off iheir lethargy and business is ac
tive, as usual at this season. The sale of
a number of important varieties is larger
than usual at this time, and demand con
tinues to increase. The effect on prices is
to keep them firm and cause an advancing
tendency in all departments. Actual im
provement in some lines has been marked,
and holders arc very confident ol further in
crease in quotations.
"The raisin situation is complicated. High
prices forced buyers to seek supplies in
Europe, but unexpected demand has com
pellc.i l.obius there to put up prices, so
that now Yaleneias cost as much as domes
tic goods, and as fully as difficult to obtain
ln sufficient quantities, owing partly to the
leluctance of holders to sell on a rising
market, and partly to the fact that Eng
lish buyers are taking about everything
they can get. The indications now ar*- that
no further price concessions will be possible
en either side the ocean. 'Loose' Muscatels
are not showing *:ny special activity, but a
number of smail lots have been sold, and ne
g.ittntior.s for large blocks are in process of
negotiation; but so far as could be learned
nothing was closed yesterday.
"Orders f< r the four sizes of Prunes are >*-
ing turned down. Only three sizes are obtain
able, and buyers hardly feel like stocking
heavily with one size missing. Nineties are
already at a substantial premium and are
likely to be higher, unless unexpected sup
plies c jicp into the mark.-t. Demand increases
steadily nnd the pric? ] s W ell maintained. The
crop of three sizes is large, but 90s are scarce
nnd larger siz.-s also, making a difficult com
plication for the broker and commission men
to meet.
"Peaches continue firm and high, with prices
tending upward on substantially all grades.
No large sales are reported, but there Is a
steady absorption of supplies, which will
epeedlly exhaust first hand holdings."

NEW YORK. Oct. 16.â The . stock market
showed a firm undertone all day and ended
with a vigorous upward movement in progress
In a number of prominent slocks, which ar .
rested reactionary tendency and made the
closing hrm. Net grains exceed a point In
only a few oases. The principal activity was
In the prominent specialties, Brooklyn Transit
continuing to attract a large share of atten
tion. There were renewed efforts to depress
the stock, but the support was too strong.
Sugar nnd tobacco, the latter selling ex
divldend, rose at one point 3% each, but did
not rave all their rain. Great Northern pre
ferred and Pullman continued their recent
show of en; th, the former rising S% and 5%
net. Pullman's extreme rise was. 6% and its
tiet gain 2. Metropolitan. Consolidated Gas
o:id Third-avenue were strong, but the latter
lost all Its gain. Southern Pacitic was the
leader of the late rally, after falling to 36 and
was marked up vigorously to 37%. St. Paul
attained a net advance of a point. The Balti
more and Ohio stocks were strong. London's,
active dealings here were very small, but the
firmness there and the lower rate for money
in London had a sentimental Influence here.
So had the good showing made by the Bank
of Germany. The rise In the private discount
rate in Berlin â¢suggested, however, that the
bank's recuperation was mac at the expense
of the open market. The decline in discount
In London was reflected in an easier tone for
Fterllng exchange rates. But higher money
rates are expected ,in London and that Ex
pectation ls a factor In the speculative out
look here. Money rates hero continue rather
easier, call loans ruling at 6 per cent or be
low. There was less demand for call loans.
Tbo amount of money disbursed by the sub
treasury on Interest account to-day, accord
ing to preliminary estimates, did not exceed
$200,000. This included not only the anticipated
interest of November 1 and for the fiscal year,
but also a considerable sum of overdue inter
est. This factor was therefore not a large
one in the easier tone of the money market.
The sub- treasury, however, had a debit bal
ance of over a million dollars at the Clearing
house on account of payment of Government
obligations. No drain is apparent thus far
from the banks into the sub-treasury on ac
count of routine operations this week.
Deposits at the sub-treasury for transfers to
other points show that the interior demand fur
| money is not yet satisfied.
The bond market continued mostly active
and somfcof the Southwestern issues moved up
ward. Total sales, par value, $1,775,000.
United States 2s advanced â Â but the 3s de
clined % in the bid price.

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, Oct. Wheat opened weak with
the sentiment decidedly bearish. Everything
seemed to be against the bulls. The drought
in the Southwest was reported completely
â  broken, world's shipments exceeded European
requirements by over a million bushels and
the Indications were that the visible supply
when completed would show a heavy Increase,
while the amount on ocean passage had in
creased a million bushels. Under those con
ditions the bulla became thoroughly disheart
ened and left the bears in full control of the
market, although the latter were not Inclined
, to push their advantage to any great extent.
The market ruled dull the greater part of the
session, while fractions were steadily scaled
off the price until the last hour, when shorts
were tempted to cover, and on buying of that
j kind there was a quick rally of %c from the
i bottom. The Improvement was only tempor
ary, however, as the support was 8008 with-
I drawn ahd at the close the market was headed
I downward again, closing within : i"' : 'v of the
j bottom of the day's range. High ocean rates
I and an advance in rates east of Buffalo helped
i the decline. December opened %c lower at
71%(a71%e. sold sparingly at 71% c, declined to
71'<,fi71%c, rose to 71% c ami closed with sellers
at 71% c.
Large receipts and a falling ofT In the for
eign demand at the seaboard weakened corn
at the opening. A smaller Increase la the
visible than expected and a belief that the wet
weather prevailing throughout the West would
retard the movement encouraged heavy buy
i ing after about an hour and a half of weak
ness, and the early decline was partly re
covered. December closed with buyers at
30%@30%0. *
Oats were weak early In sympathy with
wheat and corn, but turned strong later on
buying Induced by large clearances and a de
crease in, local stocks. December closed, at
22-%<*7*>22'%c.
Provisions ruled heavy throughout, starting
at moderate decline and Increasing the loss
as the session advanced. Too many bogs and
lower prices at the yards were the depressing
influences. Packers .-.ld heavily. January
pork closed 10Â«?12%c lower; January lard ",^,'it

Association named Albert Plssis and J.

the chairmanship of the Finance Com
mittee was accepted and Supervisor Ed

ment of those employes in the hands of j
the Police Department so that ii would .;
po into effect on December 15 instead of
November 1. Aigeltinger moved to amend

to rescind the original order, but that,
too; was lost and he again gave notice.
Black moved to amend the anti-cam
palgn banner order so that banners
might bo strung on all streets except

"Nanon" Charms Grand Opera-House
Patrons and Mile. Lotty Proves
to Be the Stellar Orpheum
Attraction.
Ah, but it is good to see our Nance In
"Magda" once more as she appeared at '
the California last night.
Greetings and hall. She comes fearless- j
ly, treading in the footsteps of others who
were long ago crowned with the wreaths ;
that still lie all before her. Nance O'Neil â 
has obstinately clung to old plays in a :
way that makes her purse hollow cheeked i
and hungry, but hers Is an obstinacy tnat j
I makes her all the dearer, after all. She
| dares and does. She has challenged com
! parison, criticism, ridicule even. And ;
I when she charges upon them with all her j
! wondrous bigness they sneak miserably j
away with only a twiddling little parting
shot that she laughs at.
Who says that Nance O'Neil fancies
herself complete? She never Implied it. i
She is an artist. An artist knows nothing '
but work, work, and there's always more i
to be learned.
What is her Magda? A something more!
splendid than her ('amine, just as her!
Camllle is more splendid than her Magda. '
1 It all depends upon which you have seen
1 last. The elocution not quite perfect now
and then? The business at a certain point
I a bit stagy? That pose slightly strained? 1
j Fie! Leave their task to director and !
i stage manager. Those criticisms are the ;
i buzzing of gnats. '
She has returned this season to soothe i
I them a bit by her Magda. It has been I
I toned down here and there. It has been
j schooled, for London was not always gen- j
I tie. But the hot blood is there just as it '

Miss Slinkey's Benefit.
There was a large audience present at
I Miss Slinkey's concert, which took place
: at the Sherman-Clay Hall last evening.
The young lady had announced that she
appeared for the first time since her re- 1
turn from Europe, where she had studied j
with the most prominent teachers. I '
have repeatedly stated that It is un
necessary for American students to go ;
| abroad to study, and Miss Slinkey's sing
| ing has strengthened me in my belief. i
: We have here a line quality of voice,
which would no doubt make good ma
| terial for a teacher to work on. But cvi
â  dently Miss Slinkey's teachers either fail
i ed to instruct her properly in the placing I
iof her voice, which seems to remain - n I
! the throat, or she did not remain long j
j enough to finish her studies. Of course,
the lady knows how to sing, but the ;
i trouble is sic- cannot execute her Ideas; :
! much like a man who arranges a fine '.ra- i
1 tion and when called upon to deliver it is â ;
! unable to do it. Furthermore Miss
I Slinkey was somewhat nervous, which j
j caused her to sing a little off pitch at
I time*. ':â¢. ':- 'â â 'â â '
â  I hate to discourage young singers, who
! have spent their time In tedious study, i
'â  but on the other hand lt Is a solemn duty j
I of the critic to point out faults so that ]
| the singer may be able to remedy them, j
! Miss Slinkev must bring her voice more i
; forward, and then she will certainly be
I very successful as a vocalist. Let us ;
admit that she may have suffered /rom j
that stage fright which first performances
usually produce. 77- ''::â¢ "' I-
Miss Marion Bear played the piano
! very Intelligently; exhibiting much taste '
'i in Interpretation. She proved that shs :
; has not wasted her time In studying ;
abroad, like many piano students, and
that she profited much by the sound ad
vice of her teachers. Bui I would not
select Brahms for a concert of this kind.
Hother Wismer played in his usual
artistic fashion, and barring a little lack ;
I of breadth of tone, his selections were far ;
â¢ superior to the work which one would i
! expect of a musician with as little pro- j
: fesslonal experience as Mr. Wismer pos- |
i sesses. The accompaniments of red
Maurer were well executed.
ALFRED METZGER. j
Tivoli.
Perhaps the most agreeable part of Au- |
ber's opera, "Fra Diavolo,'.' is its music,
' and If the melodious selections are
brought out agreeably half of the success '<
of the performance is achieved. If, how- |
ever, the vocal efforts are not within the
limits of efficiency, then the performance j
must be considered a failure. This latter ,
fact would have been almost the sad fate
'â  of the Tivoli performance had- not Tom j
Greene and Alf Wheelan pitched in and
saved the dayâ the former because of
the neat quality of his tenor, and the |
latter because of his forcible acting. I|
have heard some people say that he over
did the part, but if one considers the vil- i
lainous character of the role it would \
seem that it could not be overacted very i
m "Othello" will be given to-night and
Saturday evening, while "Cavallerla Rus
'' ticana" and "Pagliacci" will be produced \
Thursday and Sunday evenings. The ad- |
- vance sal* for these performances is al- .
ready very large and there is every rea- ,
son to believe that the house will be sold
j out on these evenings.

FOUGHT WITH ARMED
BURGLARS AT NIGHT
Harry J, Harries' Brave Work
Nearly Cost His Life.
Found Thieves in His Home and Tackled
* Them With a WinchesterâFusillade
in a Dark Dining-Room,
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, i
90S Broadway, Oct. 16.
Harry J. Harries, the son of the San ;
Francisco banker, was seriously wounded ;
ln an encounter with burglars at his â¢
home, 1361 Jackson street, early this morn- .
ing. Just by one Inch did the young man
miss death.
For several minutes after young Harries
discovered the burglars were in the house |
there was violent scuffling and a heavy ;
discharge .of firearms, . resulting in the j
shooting of Harries and. it is believed, the
wounding of one of the burglars, who ex
claimed "Oh, God!" as he was disappear- i
Ing through the door of the conservatory. \
It was nearly 4 o'clock .when Harries j
heard some one In the dining room. He at j
once got out of. bed and soon satisfied
himself that burglars were in the house.
He took his Winchester rifle from a closet
and proceeded to. Investigate. Although
there was no light in the hall he detected
two shadows of persons movine toward
the stairway. He went downstairs and |
his first thought was to press the electric
button and light up the house, but in his |
eagerness to get close to the burglars he i
passed the place on the wall where the j
buttons were located. He was retracing \
his steps toward the buttons when he was
evidently seen by the burglar, and In
stantly there was a report of a pistol and i
a bullet passed close to the side of his |
head, burying itself in a mirror. Harries j
was about to shoot with his rifle In the di
rection of the flash when he was seized I
from behind by'another burglar. |
Then ensued a desperate duel ln the
dark. Harries is an athlete and the burg- j
lar who grabbed him from behind was j
also powerful. The two men struggled for
several minutes, each trying to disarm the
other. The burglar attempted to wrench
the Winchester from Harries but without
success. The two men wrestled along the :
hall into the library and must have ere- '
ated a terrible noise, for they broke two
big piano lamps, pushed two chairs
through windows, knocked down a bust of
Psyche, overturned screens and furniture,
and shattered much valuable bric-a-brac
that had taken years to collect.
All this noise did not rouse the elder
Harries, who was asleep upstairs. Young
Harries succeeded in shaking off his an
tagonist, but he had no sooner done so
than there came a flash and a report and j
the bullet struck Harries within an inch
of the heart. The weapon was tired so
close that it burned a hole In Harries ,
dressing gown.
At this stage of the desperate encounter
the fusillade commenced in earnest. Har
ries as soon as he was shot, raised his rifle |
and shot at his antagonist. In response
another bullet whizzed past Harries
head. Once again Harries fired in the di
rection in which he had seen the revolver
flash, and Immediately it was followed by
another bullet from the burglar.
In about as many seconds ten shots
were fired, the shooter in each case hay- ;
ing nothing to guide him but the flash of I
his antagonist's gun. It was lifter Harries |
had tired his fifth shot that the burglar
exclaimed, "Oh, God!" and fired no more. |
Young Harries was looking on the floor ,
in the dark, expecting to see a dead bur- I
glar, but both had made their escape.
The noise of the shooting aroused W.H.
Harries, the father, and. armed with a
Japanese saber, he ran downstairs. He i
at once turned on the electric lights and .
in the dining-room saw his son, who re- ,
marked that tbere had been burglars In |
the house and that he was shot.
The open door from the dining-room to \
the conservatory showed plainly how the
burglars had entered and gone. Young
Harries was put to bed and Dr. Crowley
was examining him a few minutes later.
He found that the young man had been !
shot on the seventh rib and that the ball I
had plowed through the flesh for about |
two Inches to the left and had come out.
The wound of Itself was not necessarily
dangerous, but for two or three days it
wiil be Impossible to tell whether it may
result seriously.
After the victim of the burglar bullet
was attended to an inspection was made
of the house. The- wreck that was found
might have resulted from an earthquake I
or a cyclone or a genuine bombardment,
or all 'three. In the dining-room and in
the library everything was either broken
or thrown down. Bullets had crashed
through china closets, had splintered
mirrors into thousands of pieces, had
made holes in the piano and had gone
through valuable pictures. This was,
however, but a small part of the damage.
The violent combat between young Har
ries and the burglar he found in the hall
and which extended through dining-room
and library, had resulted in a complete
wreck wherever the two athletic fellows
had passed. A piano leg was kicked out
of plumb, lamps were dashed to the floor,
chairs were broken* bookcases pushed
around and upset and all the little orna
ments on the top shelves were reduced to
wreckage. \; ' . â
The most interesting scene of all, per
haps, was in "the dining-room, where,
partly on the table and partly on the
floor, were some of the most valuable
articles in the Harries household. These i
consisted of all the silver and gold plate |
and ornaments that the burglars could
find. Drawers, cabinets and sideboards
had been ransacked and their contents !
were scattered around. In their flight
the burglars had not thought, so far as '
ls known, of taking anything with them. j
The fusillade from young Harries' gun
evidently put thought of plunder out of j
their heads. Judging from the systematic |
manner ln which they had gone through
the lower floor, It Is believed the burglars
must have been at least an hour in the
house before they were discovered.
In the conservatory were found an old ,
lantern which had been struck by one of
young Harries' shots, showing how near
ly he came to ending the burglar's career; ;
and several other burglars', tools. Prob
ably when the burglar uttered the excla
mation heard by young Harries he was
holding the lamp and the bullet had
plowed through his hand.
The damage done to the furniture and
bric-a-brac by the shooting Is probably
as great as the value of the plunder
which the burglars would have taken off
had they not been discovered.
William H. Harries is the manager of
the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank of San
Francisco, and his son Is a clerk ln the
"captain Peterson and the detectives
made a thorough search of the premises
as soon as the burglary was reported.
They found enough evidence to convince !
them that the burglars were trained
thieves who had taken no chances. Be- |
sides the lantern, a partially burned can- |
die was found. At another place on the
floor a lot of white powder had been
sullied It was strychnine, intended for
any dogs that might be found. Harries
also says that he believed the burglar
with whom he struggled had greased his
clothes, as it was Impossible to get a
rood grip during their wrestling match. :
One of the burglars had evidently re- 1
loaded during the combat, for three
empty cartridges and one not exploded '
were found on the floor.
It Is very apparent 'that young Harries I
showed marked bravery throughout his
two combats with the burglars. His Win
chester did good work, as is shown by
the course of the bullets. He could at
times neither see nor hear the burglars,
as their feet were encased in felt.
"I do not know why the noise did not
rouse me," said Mr. Harries this morn- :
ing "for It must have been something
terrific. When I came downstairs the j
place looked like a wreck. Lamps had i
been overturned., the glass in the win
dows and over the pictures had been shat- }
tered by the flying bullets, and destruc
tion was everywhere. Hurriedly my boy
told me the story, and I put him to bed,
called Dr. Crowley and notified the po- i
.lice." " y- â -'â â â / â *â â¢' "-y'- -â 'â¢
"Only a rib stood between the young
man and instant death," said Dr. Crow
lev. "The bullet struck the seventh rib just ,
below the heart, was turned from its j
course and came out about two Inches
from where It entered. One wound Is
badly powder burned and the other Is
clean-cut The patient is now quiet and
I do not think he is in any danger."
No clew has yet been found that may
lead to the arrest of the burglars, but
the police are satisfied that they are old
hands.
A TIMELY RESCUE.
ALAMEDA, Oct. 16.â John Sparks of i
j Clinton avenue and Gilbert Ghillerl of I
i 2112 San Antonio avenue, two boys, nar- j
j rowly escaped drowning yesterday even- ]
| Ing off the westerly shore of Bay Farm j
j Island. The boys were out opposite j
i Broadway and close to the west end of i
j the island, when 'their boat, a frail canoe, i
was upset and the two youthful mariners :
j were thrown Into the water. The water
at this point Is deep and the current very
strong. Sparks, who Is a fairly good ;
swimmer, managed to keep afloat and to j
I assist his less fortunate companion, but
Ghilierl weakened rapidly and his com- ;
panion had about given up in despair i
| when their predicament was discovered !
; by Harry Rosseter, who went to their â 
| assistance. The half-drowned youths were !
pulled Into Rosseter's boat, where It re- ;
' quired considerable effort on the part of
; Rosseter and Sparks to resuscitate Ghil- !
I lerl.
Police Clerk Abolished.
I OAKLAND, Oct. 16. -The City Council !
to-night finally passed the ordinance
abolishing the position of clerk of the I
Chief of Police. There has been a fight
over this for several months and It only
passed by one vote with a full Council
present. The Mayor will veto it, and as
eight votes cannot be obtained for It
Clerk Agnew will not be removed. Coun
cilman Taylor secured the passage of a
resolution setting forth that many fatal
accidents occurred for want of proper
fenders on street cars and earnestly re
; questing the Mayor to see that the cx
i isting ordinance requiring fenders is en
forced.
The Borden-Cohen Suit.

SEEKING TO END
THE QUARANTINE
New Orleans Sues for
an Injunction.
Â»
Special Dispatch to The Call.
"WASHINGTON. Oct. 16.â Acting for the
Attorney General of the State of Louis
iana, Edgar H. Farrar to-day entered a
motion in the United States Supreme
Court for leave to file a bill for injunction
jon behalf of the State of Louisiana
; against the State of Texas prohibiting
i the freight embargo feature of the yellow
I fever quarantine against New Orleans.
' The Attorney General of Texas was pres-
e nt in the court when the motion was
, made and asked until to-morrow to ex
amine the papers in the case. He said
he would object to the motion on the
; ground that the court had no jurisdiction.
! The further hearing was continued until
to-morrow, in accordance with this re
â  quest.
While recognizing the power of the
; State of Texas to take proper precautions
j for the protection of the people of the
I State against contagion, the Attorney
I General of Louisiana takes the position
j in his bill that the Texas authorities have
i no right under the cover of exercising
; police powers to burden interstate com-
I merce so as to make it impossible, which
I they claim is the effect of the existing
i quarantine regulations.
The fact is pointed out that commerce
j is permitted between the Texas ports and
i ports of Mexico. Cuba and South Amer
! lea, which are permanently infected with
j fever, and the statement is made that the
; effect of the embargo against New Or-
I leans is to enhance the trade of Galveston
[ and other Texas cities at the expense of
, the mercantile interests of New Orleans.
; The declaration is made that the quaran
\ tine is "nothing less than a commercial
i war." ,
The conclusion is drawn that the quar
antine Is in direct violation of the inter
' state commerce clause of the constitution
; of the United States.
DOCTRINE EXPLAINED.
Rev. Father Newell, O. P., on Its
Reasonableness.
An interesting- lecture on "ThÂ© Rea
sonableness of Catholic Doctrine" was
delivered last night by Rev. Father Ne
well. O. P., at the Young Men's Institute
in the Pioneer building under the aus
pices of Isnatian Council No. 35, V. M. I.
The reverend lecturer argued that
Catholic doctrine, as well as reason itself,
were gifts of God, and therefore could not
conflict with each othef.
"In this connection," said Father Ne
well. "I desire to qualify human reason by
the epithet 'right reason,' because as you
well know reason is capable of abuse and
perversion. Catholic doctrine may be di
vided into two â truths of a natural order
and those which possess supernatural
characteristics. The natural religious
truths are capable of an exact and scien
tific demonstration by the simple force
of our own natural reason. Nothing is
more reasonable than the fundamental
truths of the existence of God, the crea
tion of the world and the immortality of
the soul, upon which truths all religion
reposes. We all have an innate idea of
the infinite which represents the real be
ing of the Almighty. In believing in
them we but confirm what the highest
geniuses have given testimony to.
"Reason has no right to demonstrate
the supernatural doctrines because it has
not the power to do so. Supernatural
truths have been revealed by God himself
and our weak intellect cannot grasp them
in their entirety. But the evidence that
supports supernatural truths is both docu
mentary and historical. The Holy Scrip
tures are in themselves proof sufficient of
the reasonableness of supernatural truths
and the authenticity of the witnesses to
them cannot be questioned."

DEMOCRATS RATIFY THEIR MUNICIPAL NOMINATIONS
Mayor Pbelan Pro
claims Himself
Leader of a New
Democracy and
Claims Re-elec
tion.
He Sees No Political Virtue
in the Opponents Whom
He Must Meet at the
Polls.
METROPOLITAN HALL. was
crowded to the doors last night
by members of the local Democ
racy. w 'bo assembled to ratify
their municipal ticket and cheer
their nominees. Most of the candidates
were given an opportunity to deliver ad
dresses and plead for the votes of their
hearers Mayor Phelan was, as a matter
of course, the central figure of the event
and the leading speaker. He delivered a
ton- addfess carefully prepared. He stu
diously steered clear of the rocks of na
tional -lilies and the inconsistencies in
which his own utterances have involved
him. lie elaborated at great length upon
iho history of the origin and development
of tho larter and claimed for himself
and associates the right to conduct the
first administration of the city s affairs
under the charter.
In making this claim Mayor Phelan
dated a new political doctrine and
proclaimed the existence of what perhaps
Â£ a new political party masking under the
name and usurping the allegiance that be
longs to an old one. Of this new political
party Mayor Phelan, by his words, sought
to leave the impression that he is the or
ganizer and Leader. He says that the
Democracy of which ho is the dictator
was born in the agitation for a new char
ter. This Democracy is not - concerned
with national Issues and has its being
solely ln a realm of municipal affairs.
The Mayor also discussed from his point
of view tne axiairs uf the city for the last
y ar He claimed lor himselt and the two
democratic members ot the Boardfof,Su
pervisors all of the during the last
ken won lor the people during the last
year over various corporations. lie
charged that His Republican opponents
arc tinged and even saturated by the pol
icy ol the capitalistic and corporate class,
aud while he would not charge them with
S shonesty; he insisted that they cannot be
fair. The -Mayor's addres and a cheer
closed the ratification. , r _
In opening the meeting Jasper McDon
ald very briefly referred to the Democratic
nominees ami begged for them the suf
frages of his hearers. Frank â : Gould
was Introduced as the president of the
meeting, and took the opportunity to en
large upon the lines of the opening ad
dress praising everybody -Â ho has re
tenci'i from the Democratic convention
the courtesy of a nomination. Mr. Gould
he'd the ph'aforin for a few minutes and
then introduced Dennis J. Geary as the
first speaker of the night. The = Introduc
tion in Us way was a gem. Mr. Gould
6-' id he hoped the audience would give Mr.
Geary more ballots than he had received
bullets at Manila. As the major had the
good fortune to miss the bullets the rec
ommendation made tor him was certam
]v not unreasonable. y. â  _ x , , ...
Major Geary was uncomfortably bellig
erent .luring his address He fairy
bristled with military adjectives. He
saw in Mayor Phelan a great war Mayor
whose fame for some mysterious reason
has been carried across the seas. Every
body on the Democratic ticket, in the
Majors opinion, is a military gentleman
who is n..\v fighting the good fight. One
by one the various municipal nominees
presented themselves and asked the
patronage and support of their hearers
for the offices they seek.
It was not until Assessor Dodge began
his address that the meeting assumed a
characteristic phase. Dr. Dodge, with
that peculiar modesty which marks him,
talked about himself flatteringly for over
an hour. He frankly announced that he
had made a most efficient and honest
official. He gave an extended but not
particularly thrilling lecture on assess
ment in general and his proficiency par
ticularly in the art:
Several unsympathetic listeners ln the
[gallery called time, but the modest
Assessor declined to stop. He wished, he
paid, to show the audience two or three
charts illustrative of his splendid admin
istration. The two or three charts proved
to be five, and hen another call for time
was made. This time the speaker said
he would quit If they wanted him to do
po. but an encouraging voice shouted,
"i Jo on; we'll listen to you if we have to
Btay here all night," and the. Assessor
continued without further interruption
to the end. ,
While on the subject of charts Mr.
Dodge made, a rather dubious Impression

Health in her beaming eyes, health in

hours can't save her from the common

â¢which dulls the eye, pales the cheek,

"Miss Ella Sapp, of Jamestown, Guilford Co.,
N. C.. writes : I had suffered three years or
more at monthly periods. It seemed as though
I would die with pain in my back and stomach.
I could not stand without fainting; had given
up ail hope of ever being cured, When one of
my friends Insisted upon mv trying Dr. Pierces
Favorite Prescription. With but little faith I
tried it. and before I had takeii half a bottle I

on his audience, which hesitated whether
to be tickled or Insulted. One of the
charts was partly colored green. Be
fore any reference was made to the pur
pose of the map some one applauded. A
general laugh followed at the sally and
its supposed meaning. When Dr. Dodge
had an opportunity to speak he said
genially: *! did not color the map green
designedly, although I know I am talk
ing to .i Democratic audience."
In concluding his address Dr. Dodge
pleaded for votes, not because he is a
Democrat, but because he is a good man.
He declared emphatically that he is op
posed to straight party tickets. He be
lieves that straight voting Is a relic of
"knownothingism." Upon this point he
differed from his predecessor. Major
Gears*. The major's name is farther down
on the ballot and he is most deeply con
vinced that all Democrats should vote
straight. Several other candidates, who
want to shine by something more sub
stantial than the reflected light of Dodge,
expressed the same views.
Most of the other nominees also deliv
ered addresses which, with one exception,
Possessed no deeper significance than spe
cial pleading for votes. That exception

was the address of Franklin K. Lane,
aspirant for re-election as City and
County Attorney. Mr. Dane spoke at
great length on the virtues of the char
ter, In the midst of his speech Mayor
Phelan stepped upon the platform ana
was received with three cheers.
About 100 Democrats occupied seats on
the stage, the front row of chairs being
reserved for the candidates and speakers.
Jasper McDonald, chairman of the Dem
ocratic County Committee, called th"
meeting to order in a short speech He
said:
"As chairman of the County Commit- i
tee of the city and county of San Fran
cisco it becomes my pleasing duty to call j
this meeting to order, This meeting is
held under the auspices of the said com
mittee and is for the purpose of gratify_
ing the ticket recently nominated."
Mr. McDonald then proceeded to throw
a few bouquets at the candidates, notably
Mayor Phelan, "also Dr. Dodge, also
Franklin K. Dane and also that sturdy I
Supervisor Jeremiah Deasy." He de
clared that the administrations of Mayor
Phelan and other Democratic office hold
ers were above reproach and deserving
the Indorsement of all good citizens, espe
cially Democratic citizens. He then in
troduced Frank 11. Gould as chairman of
the meeting.
Mr. Gould received a very flattering re
ception. He said among other things: ft:* ?
"It is a pleasure to preside at a-rati
fication meeting where there is something
to ratify. Such a meeting is this. The
Democrats of San Francisco and a sprink
ling of patriotic Republicans last year
elected a certain Mayor and other officials
ln San Francisco. They were selected
under certain pledges, and I. leave It to
you to say whether they have lived up to
those pledges.
"I call upon the people to-night to know
whether they ratify the nomination of
James D. Phelan, whose heart beats in
unison with the . honest voters of San
Francisco. You have elected him once
and you will do bo again. (Applause.)
"Nominated and elected by acclama
tion." (Laughter and applause, I
"Do you ratify the nomination of the
man who has given the people Of San
Francisco the best and fairest assessment]
it ever had. Do you ratify the nomina
tion of Washington Dodge? (Applause.)
"Good again; unanimously elected."
(More applause and laugh!
"Do you ratify the nomination of the
man who never lost a case in which the
city was defendant? Do you ratify the
nomination of Franklin K. Dane for City
and County Attorney? (Applause.)
"Again unanimously carried.
"Do you ratify the nomination of that
upright and honorable gentleman, Jere
miah Deasy, for Sheriff?"
Major Geary Introduced.
Mr. Gould went down through the list
in this manner until he came to the name
of Major Dennis Geary, the nominee for
County Clerk. Major Geary received an
extra coat of flattery, and th(Â» audience,
fired by a reference to his connection with
the army, gave him an enthusiastic wel
come. Mr. Gould seized the favorable op
portunity to introduce the . Democratic
candidate for County Clerk. Major Geary
spoke ln part as follows:
"I am not a politician, my friends, and
it is only on short notice that I was called
upon to speak here to-night. I under
stand the principles of the Democratic
party and those principles are based on
justice and fairness. On tills platform a'
few nights ago a gentleman, who was
nominated for a prominent oflice by the
opposition, spoke of the necessity of ap
! pointing KOOO men on the various boards
under the new charter, but he forgot to
say that the man best qualified to make
those appointments is tin- gentleman who
at the present moment occupies the posi
tion of Mayor of San Francisco, and who
is at the head of the democratic party in
this city. And as a soldier I say that
Mayor Phelan Is San Francisco's* war
Mayor. We, in the far away Philippines, .
always knew that with him at the head of
the administration in San Francisco we
were always sure of a powerful friend at
home. We knew that he was doing all he
could to make our life in that tropical,
fever-infested country as near tolerable as
possible, and we knew who it was that
was the mainstay of the Red Cross work,
which was a blessing to so many soldiers
in camp and on the firing line."
Boland Talks a Little.
Patrick Boland, nominee for Public Ad
ministrator, was next given a chance to
tell the audience what a good official he
would make, in the event of his election.
He made a short speech and the audience
applauded his forethought in so doing.
He said:
"I might say I don't know how to be
gin to make a speech. I might say I never
spoke in public in my life, and that would
be the truth. They say that where there
is a will there is a way, but in this in
stance where there is a will there is no
way. But I will say that I am proud to
occupy a place on the ticket with the hon
orable gentlemen who have been nomi
nated by the Democratic party. I will
gay that If elected I will endeavor to fill
THE SAy FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 17, 1899.
the office in such a manner that the party
will not have to regret placing me on the
ticket." Mr. Boland could not retire un
til he had paid a fulsome compliment to
the soldierly and other good qualities of
Major Geary, after which he quietly sub
sided.
Dodge Gets a Chance.
Chairman Gould at this point fished up
a few bouquets of extra size which he
tossed gracefully in the direction of As
sessor Dodge as a preliminary to intro- !
ducing that gentleman to the notice of
the Democratic voters present. The doc
tor was given quite an enthusiastic re
ception and made a speech full of figures
and alleged facts. He said:
"Fellow-citizens: 1 desire to thank you j
for this evident mark of your apprecia- i
tion and If lt is an indorsement of my [
public career during the past year I am
doubly thankful. I know that a man in |
ofiice is always subject to adverse crit- I
icism by a partisan press and from other '
sources, and I kyow that such things are
to be expected, but on an occasion of this
kind to receive such a reception is ex
ceedingly grateful and I desire to again
thank you."
Dr. Dodge proceeded to confide to his
hearers what he proposed to do for the
small property owners of the city, prom
' ising that their assessments should be
! lighter and the assessments against the
holdings of the wealthier property own
ers proportionately heavierâ in the event
of his re-election. He referred to the ease
with which the personal property of the
rich, such as bank stock, etc., could be
concealed from the Assessor, and said
such practices threw the, burden of tax
ation on the poor. He quoted from a
speech by President Harrison in support
of his contention and endeavored thereby
to show thai Mr. Harrison feared that the
country was drifting toward anarchy,
revolution and social upheaval by reason
of the dearth of Assessors like himself.
Brings Forth His Charts.
He declared that it had been his con
stant endeavor to enforce the taxation of
personal property and dragged forth a
number of charts to illustrate how this
great benefit to the public had been ac
complished. He claimed that by his
method of taxing personal property the
wealthy classes had been assessed for
J.i 0.000.000 more than they had been as
sessed by his predecessor. Of this amount
he said $19,600,000 had been assessed
against Quasi-public corporations. He
further said that every lot in an area rep
resenting three-quarters of the- area of
Ban Francisco, had its assessment reduc
ed, the total amount taken off the total
assessment in the outlying districts being
$2,200,000, while the holdings of real estate
in the downtown section of the city, in
cluding the Mission district, had been in
creased proportionately.
Richard P. Doolan, nominee for Tax
Collector, thankerl the Democrats for the
honor of his nomination, promised to do
all he could to help the Democrats to get
control of the new city government and
took his seat. At this point Mayor Thelan
entered, and was given three cheers and
a tiger.
Byington Talks Briefly.
Lewis F. Byington informed the audi
ence that he was glad he had been domi
nated by the Democratic party for the
office of District Attorney. He asserted
his belief that every Democrat elected by
the people of San Francisco a year ago
had conscientiously lived up to his
pledges. He declared that for himself he
had endeavored to do his duty as Super
visor, and took occasion to pay a very
neat compliment to Mayor Phelan, prais
ing him for his ability and progressive
ideas. Mr. Byington's speech was care
fully worded and possessed the unusual
merit of brevity.
( isgocd Putnam, nominee for Super
visor, followed Mr. Byingt.in with what
was intended to be a facetious speech, but
the attempt fell flat and he concluded his
remarks by attempting to show that the
new charter was the special property of
the Democratic party and owed Its exist
ence chiefly to the paternal care of James
D. Phelan during the process of its incu
bation. He acknowledged that one sec
tion of the Democratic party had opposed
the charter and that It had been finally
passed by a Republican Legislature, but
facts like those could not feaze him. In
conclusion Mr. Putnam praised each and
every one of the Democratic candidates
for office as the best material that could
have been selected. .
Joseph Gumming, candidate for Auditor,
promised to give his time to the office if
elected .and give the people a business
| like administration, if they saw fit to elect
him, and urged his listeners to vote the
Democratic ticket from top to bottom.
Edmond Godchaux, nominee for Re
corder, raid: "I am the humble nominee
of the Democratic party for the office of
Recorder. I was a member of the Dem
ocratic Legislature which sent Stephen
M. White to the United States Senate,
and am proud of it. I have also been
secretary of the Board of Health under
Mayor Phelan, who taught the people
that that office should be paramount to
all others. I will, If elected Recorder, do
my duty as well as I have all the duties
intrusted to me in the past."
Deasy Receives an Ovation.
Jeremiah Deasy, candidate for Sheriff,
was well received by the audience, and
said In substance: "I am delighted to see
such a grand audience at this ratification,
and it satisfies me that the ticket Is going
to be ratified and elected by an over
whelming majority on the seventh of No
vember next. Last year, on this platform,
I gave you my pledge and you elected me,
and I hope that you are not sorry. I
leave it to you again. If you see lit to
make me your next Sheriffâ and I think
you willâ promise you that I will con
duct the office as honestly and as fear
lessly as I have done my duty as Super
visor.
*E. P. Mogan, candidate for Police
Judge, after thanking the audience for Its
generous applause, said that since taking
his position on the bench he has been so
cially ostracized. "When I invite my
friends to call and see me. and stay a
while they get insulted. Seriously, I want
to say a few words ln favor of my asso
ciates on the ticket. There is a young
gentleman whom you nominated last year
for Justice of the Peace; this year you
have nominated him for Police Judge. I
will vouch for him as a clever young gen
tleman and a good lawyer. I refer to Al
J. Fritz.
Above all, you have an honest and ca
pable man in George H. Cabaniss. You
have supported Charles T. Conlan before
and he has proved himself worthy of a
renominatlon. Gentlemen, If you do your
i Uty -, is a certainty that we will give
the Republicans what the Columbia gave
the Shamrock to-day."
Lane Well Received.
Franklin D. Lane received a warm wel
come when introduced.
"I told you," he said, "when I pledged j
myself to you last year that I would sup
port the charter, and that I have done.
1 hope the Supreme Court will sustain
the entire charter. The enemies of the
charter have tried to defeat it as a whole,
and when not successful they tried to de
feat it hit by bit, lection by section, to
tear it apart and leave it a misshapen
mags. On the next City Attorney falls
the work of interpreting the charter's
meaning.
"It is in his power as the advisor of
all the city officials to define the charter
in such a. way as to render It useless and
do away with all the good work you
have done In framing it. If it is your wish
that I be re-elected to the office of City
Attorney, I promise you that I will serve
you as I have in the past.. I was in the
audience here last Saturday night at th-:
Republican ratification meeting, and I
have seldom been to a meeting from whicli
I derived so much satisfaction. When
Irving Scott spoke of the Olympia as the
product of the skill of the mechanics of
San Franclsco I was proud, but I wanted
to rise up and ask why Scott did not
apply the same principle to the charter
as he did to the battleship, when he asked
his hearers to vote the entire Republican
ticket.
"I now ask, Mr. Scott, when giving a
new battleship a builder's trial trip would
he take men on that trial to
work the vessel who had not
been tried and who were not acquainted
with the. work before them? If Mr. Scott
had the Interest of the charter for the
charter's sake at heart he should have
said to the audience, 'The ship on trial
now is the charter ship, and we want only
men who are tried. There is nothing lh
municipal politics but to get the right
man.' And he would not ask the men their
politics. Ââ¢:.-.
"Now. gentlemen, with the accomplish
ment of a new charter our work must not
end. We must take advantage of the po
sition San Francisco is now in and work
hard to make it one of the foremost cities
of the commercial world. San Franclsco
should rise to the occasion and put men
in charge who are worthy and true."
Dr. R. Beverly Cole was next Intro
duced and made a very good Impression
on the audience by a short speech in,
which he eulogized the Mayor and prom
ised to serve the people honestly and to
the best of his ability If he should be
elected Coroner. .7 â ",". .-_
Phelan Is Facetious.
Mayor ' Phelan. was next to talk, and
said:
: "Mr. Chairman and Ladles and Gentle
men: I thank you very much for this
cordial reception. I think I am the only
man on the platformâ the Democratic
platformâ was not present at the
Republican mass meeting, but they tell
me the tide was on the ebb. I think that
mass meetings, from my little experience
of San Francisco, indicate the condition
of the public pulse, and they say a doctor
can tell by feeling of a man's pulse
when he is going to die. I am sorry for
the Republicans, but they will die In a
good cause our cause. But some of the
Republicans, and I hope many of them
âare going to vote' for us, for I believe
they are patriots. They claim to be, and
some of them I suppose went to the Phil
ippines, but I am not sure; Major Geary
did not find many of them over there."
Having had his little joke the Mayor
grew serious and devoted considerable
time in trying to show that the Republi
cans were endeavoring to make capital
out of the war. At the same time he
apologized for the Democrats' action in
placing Major Geary on the ticket, ex
plaining that It was done as a reward to
MRS. CRITTENDEN THORNTON
DIES IN THE FRENCH CAPITAL
MRS. CRITTENDEN THORNTON, the wife of the well-known attorney,
died yesterday morning in Paris, where she bad been living for the last
six months. Mrs. Thornton left San Francisco last April for the French
capital to seek medical treatment. The news of Mrs. Thornton's
death, though unexpected, did not come as a utter surprise. Three weeks
ago her husband, Crittenden Thornton, received a cablegram from his wife that
a sudden turn- in her Illness made life precarious, but soon after her physicians
pronounced her out of danger. The end came yesterday morning and the sud
den news quite prostrated Crittenden Thornton, whose latest previous informa
tion was that his wife was recovering.
Mrs. Crittenden Thornton was the daughter of David D. Colton, one of the
most prominent of early railroad men in California, Her father was one of the
original builders of the Central Pacific, and for a long time was intimately con
nected with the "Great Four," Huntington, Hopkins, Crocker and Stanford. She
has been a great traveler, usually accompanied by her mother, Mrs. Ellen N.
Colton, and her daughter, now Mrs. Siegfried Schacher. A few months ago, whilÂ«
in Paris, Miss Helen Thornton was married and the wedding was one of the
events of the season among the American colony in Paris.
Mr. and Mrs. Schacher and Mrs. Ellen Colton will soon leave for San Fran
cisco, accompanying the body of Mrs. Crittenden Thornton.
The deceased was 44 years of age and a native of . California, her birthplace
being Treka, Siskiyou County.

fairs Under the Charter
Announced as the Only
Issue of the Campaign.
a gallant officer. Continuing, he said:
"We are now engaged in a great bat
tle. The battle that has been going on
in San Francisco is. Shall we own of be
owned? There is always in every city a
certain class seeking to obtain proprie
tary rights over our streets, under our
streets and in the air above the streets,
and in the success of the efforts of these
greedy monopolists lies our greatest dan
ger. The Republicans are not prepared
to wage a war against this greed because
they would be warring against them
selves. They would be committing hara
kiri, by which a man destroys himself.
Republicans Not Blamed.
"But that is no strong indictment
against our fellow-citizens. They are
not to blame, but are unfortunate in be
ing so placed. I came here to-night for
the purpose of telling you what the city |
would be under the new charter. I did j
not come to reply to the speeches made
by the Republican nominees in this hall ;
the other night, for I really see nothing I
in them to reply to. I believe they spoke
on the new charter, and I do not see that
they are entitled to any credit for it. It
was not the work of any party, but was
compiled for the benefit and with the co
operation of all good citizens of San
Francisco."
The speaker then proceeded to detail |
the steps taken to organize a board of
freeholders to draft the charter and the
subsequent events leading up to its adop
tion and ratification by the Legislature.
"We do not claim the entire credit of the
new charter," he said, "but we claim that
this meeting here to-night is the outcome
of the. adoption of that charter. There Is
not a man on the Democratic ticket who
was not an advocate of this charter and
who did not fight for it, while there are
men on the Republican ticket who op
posed it from the beginning.
"Our party, the present Democratic or
ganization, had its birth in the charter
fight, and I say that the men who are |
leading the Republican party to-day do i
not refer to the head of the ticket, but to j
the men .and corporations who are behind j
that partyâ are opposed to the charter i
and before it was adopted did their ut
most to defeat it.
"I will say of the Democratic platform
this: It has come to pass in the last three
years that platforms have come to mean
something. The Democratic platform
means something. It means that if elect
ed we will give the city a businesslike,
honest government.
Claims All the Credit.
"It Is rather peculiar, perhaps, for you
to know that the Democratic minority in
the Hoard of Supervisors during the past
year has controlled nearly every essen
tial act of the Supervisors.' notwithstand
ing the opposition of the majority."
He claimed that there had been reduc
tions in rates all along the line and
created a laugh by saying that in trying
to explain how the minority had managed
to have its own way one of the Repub
lican Supervisors had claimed that he
(the Mayor) had fllmflammed them.
Mr. Phelan proceeded to explain how,
according to his theories, the Democratic
minority on the board had secured a re
duction of the gas rate. The history of
the fight against the San Francisco Gas
and Electric was rehearsed in detail and
the claim made that the Democratic Su
pervisors and himself were entitled to the
entire credit for the victory over the mo
nopoly, a victory which he said meant a
saving to the people of the city of San
Francisco of $300,000 a year. He also re
ferred to the attempt of the Market Street
Railway system to get a franchise to the
county line in order to evade assessment
by the City and County Assessor by or
ganizing an Intercounty system and thus
placing the authority to levy an assess
ment against its entire line in and out of
this city and county in the hands of the
State Board of Equalizers, which the
Market Street Company controlled. This
scheme also, Mr. Phelan claimed, was
foiled by the Democratic minority of the
present Board of Supervisors.
Fight Against Corporations.
"The great battle, I say, is between the
people and the corporations. I do not
mean to assert that the corporations do
not bring any benefit to a city, but I claim
that they do not pay an adequate compen
sation for the privilege of doing business
in the municipality. It is a battle, but a
bloodless battle. The corporations are on
the defensive; they are compelled to re
sist, while it is our business to press them !
and force them to pay a fair compensa
tion to the city for the. privileges they en
joy.
"The remedy for all this is in the mu
nicipal ownership of public utilities. When
we nave these we will have won the great
fight against these quasi-public corpora
tions. .";"'.'
"Now that the people with the new char
ter have the means of putting these re
forms into execution we ask for a renewal
of confidence in order that we may inau
gurate the charter in the spirit in which
it was adopted. Under the charter the
Police, the Fire, the Health and the Edu
cational departments will pass into the
control of the Mayor, and it is a responsi
bility that any man might well shirk. The
man who undertakes the task of naming
the men who are to serve on these boards
should possess three qualifications: He
should be possessed of experience ln the
affairs of the city and the character of the
work his appointees will be called upon to
fill and he should be a good Judge of
men."
Mr. Phelan declared in conclusion that
lie was under no obligation to any man
for his nomination; that he had been nom
inated by the people, owed fealty to the
people only and if elected would be wholly
free from any political obligation and in a
position to devote his best energies for
the next two years to the welfare of the
people of San Franclsco.
Then the audience gave three cheers for
Phelan, the band played and the people
| marched out of the hall.

DRUGGED AND ROBBED.
Experience of John Ehalainen, a
Steward in the Hospital Corps
at the Presidio.
Joseph Ehalainen, a steward in the
United States Army Hospital Corps sta
tioned at the Presidio, was drugged and
robbed in a saloon and thrown into the
street early yesterday morning, where he
was found by Policeman Joy and taken
to the Receiving Hospital in a semi-con
scious condition.
Restoratives were applied and he re
covered consciousness in a few hours. He
told Joy that he went to Alameda Sunday
to visit friends and while returning on
the boat met a soldier of the Twentieth
Kansas. They had some drinks and he
remembered playing the slot machine and
asking the bartender to change a $5 gold
piece. He drank three glasses of port
wine in the saloon. His hip pocket had
been cut and $56 taken out of It and his
gold watch and chain had also been
stolen.
The saloon was "Young Mitchell's," on
the corner of Taylor street and Golden
Gate avenue, and when Joy called there
the bartender did not deny that the two
soldiers were drinking there, but de de
nied that Ehalainen was drugged and
robbed. The police are investigating the
case.

BOYD MUST ACCOUNT.
Heirs of the Davis Estate Defeat Him
in Legal Battle.
Judge Belcher yesterday rendered judg
ment in favor of Lizzie Muir and Belle
Curtis, heirs of the estate of the late
Jacob Z. Davis, and against Alexander
Boyd for an accounting.
Boyd was a partner of Jacob Z. Davis,
who died in October, 1896. leaving an
estate valued at {2,000,000. li" conducted
the affairs of the copartnership until the
estate of the deceased was distributed to
the heirs. The heirs claimed that Mr.
Boyd owed the Davis estate some $30,000,
and as he refused to account, they Bled
suit. Mr. Boyd claimed that his services
on behalf of the copartnership were rea
sonably worth the amount of the differ
ence in the accounts, some $30,000. and
that the matter should be allowed to
stand. Judge Belcher, however, has de
cided that his services were not unusually
laborious and that he Is entitled to no
compensation therefor. Hence Mr. Boyd
must pay the plaintiff $30,000 unless the
judgment is reversed on appeal.
