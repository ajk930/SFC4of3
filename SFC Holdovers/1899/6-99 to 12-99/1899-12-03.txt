TERRIBLE LOSSES IN SOUTH AFRICA
CAUSE DISMAY IN GREAT BRITAIN
English People of All Classes
Are Beginning to Realize the
Serious Consequences of the
Conflict With the Boers â Me
thuen's Heavy Losses in the
Modder River Battle.
LONDON, Dec. 3.â The prevailing sentiment daily
here is that England is paying very
dearly for the war in South Africa, and there is a feeling
of dismay over the terrible losses. I have seen a letter,
â en by a member ot the royal family to-day,

'All these victories sound very grand as heroic
ounters and proofs of British pluck, but they are

LO-VDON. Dec. 3.â Another
<iay of silence as to- the present
movements oi the British troops
has further increased the feeling
of anxiety which prevails among
all classes. The long list of killed,
wounded and missing among the
non-commissioned officers and
privates in the engagement at
Modder River is now forthcom
ing with a total of 76 killed and
37Â» Â» wounded and missing. This
brought home to the hearts of the
English people with renewed
force the fact that this war will
entail an appalling loss of life be
fore it is finished.
On the other hand the dis
patches to the War Office j-how
that Lord Methuen's last battle
was a decided British victory,
clearing the Boers from the river

needed by Kimbcrley. cannot be

REINFORCEMENTS REACH
GENERAL METHUEN
LONDON. Dee 2.â The "War OflW has
received th* following from General
Forester- Walker:
"CAPE TOWN, Friday. Df>c. LâGen
eral Gatacre reports no change in the
situation.
"General French had made a recon
raissnr.ee from Naauwport to Rossmead.
The troops returned to-day.
"General Methuen's flesh wound Is

for the reconstruction of the bridge. Am
reinforcing him with Highlanders an a
cavalry corps. Horse artillery, the Can
adian rectment. Australian contingent
and three battalions Infantry moved up
to De Aar and Helmont line."
From General Forester-Walker"? dis
patch It Is proved that all reports of Gen
eral MethuÂ«>n'B advance after the battle
of Modder River were premature, thougn
with the railroad working he should not
he long In constructing a temporary
bridge. His enforced delay doubtless will
be of considerable service in giving his
hard-pushed column needful rest, and in
allowing the arrival of reinforcements, of
which he must be sorely in need aftÂ»r
three such fights, placing hors de .mi.it
upward of a thousand men out of less
than 7000.
General Forester-Walker's announce
ment that the Canadian marksmen and
other reinforcements have been pushed
forward to the neighborhood of the
Orange River to protect General Me
thuen's line of communication has re
lieved much anxiety here, where it was
fully expected the Roers would attempt
to attack the vunerable points of the
line of commuicatlon.
DESPERATE EFFORTS TO

BULLER'S CAMPAIGN HAS
BEEN MATERIALLY CHANGED
LONDON, Dec. 2.â The South African war progresses
slowly. The work of rectifying the false military situa
tion Is evidently none too easy General Ballot I cam
paign. Instead of being aggressive, as planned, is now
wholly subservient to the necessity of relieving Klrnber
ley and Ladysmlth. It seems that both objects will soon
be gained, though not without another engagement' be
tween General White's unstrengthened forces and the
reinforced Boers.
General Methuen is described in a weekly as being
the bright spot In the Boer campaign. He has won great
popular favor by his victories on the march to Kimberley.
No one. it is said, knows the topography between the
Orange River and Klmberley better than he does. He
traversed in ISS4 all the ground he is now operating on.
The general works his men harder than almost any other
British officer, and Is somewhat Spartan In his habits,

FRANCE DEMANDS CABLES
FOR NATIONAL DEFENSE
PARIS. Dec. 2.â The absolute dependence of
France upon England for news of the Transvaal
war, owing to the fact that the cables are under
the control of the Finglish, has greatly irritated
press sentiment. The Colonial Commission has
urged the Government to take immediate steps
to equip France with cable communication with
her colonies in the following order:
A line uniting France with Senegal, another
with Madagascar, and a third connecting Ton
quin with the Danish company's cables.
These, the commission say, are an urgent
necessity, and afterward will be needed lines be
tween Senegal, Konakry, Grand Rassam. Koto
noa and Congo, while another should connect
Indo-China with Djibouti and Madagascar. The
commission also strongly advises watchfulness
in the Pacific, so that French possessions may
be brought into cable communication with the
metropolis by means of American and German
lines.
One hundred and twenty-five million francs
($25,000,000) would be needed to carry out the
project. An increase of commerce is expected to
cover the outlay, but with true French logic, it
is claimed that whether trade warrants it or
not, the work should be undertaken for the pur
pose of national defense.

GARDNER BELIEVES
BUCHANAN INSANE
_
fldmits Tfyat He Received a liar)d
sor^e pee for Examining h|im
at Marysville.
NAPA. Dec. 2.â Dr. A. M. 'Gardner, med
ical superintendent of the Napa State
| Hospital, received fliCO as his fee hi the
! case it Hugh Buchanan, who was pro
â¢ nounced Insane by a lunacy commission
of which Dr. Gardner was a member.
, whiie or. trie! at Marysville for the. mur
der of M'!l!l2.:n H. Miles in lEM. He' testi
fied that he wr.s paid this Bum by E. S.
I Buchanan, a brother of Hugh, for exam
i ining and passlr.e upon the mental condi
tion of the latter In an Impartial manner
! and with the view of serving the ends of
! Justice.
Dr. Gardner occupied the entire day of
I the court's r eÂ«elcn to-day. He took the
j ctand cr.ly after Attorney General Ford
j ai-A hla specie! o'torr.eya had intuit an
! effort to iave him from the ordeal of
j question and cress-question and after
J District Attorney 801 l had offered to take
j Dr. Gardner ac a witness for Hugh Hu
; chanan. In Hi' course of his ezamlna
; tlon he admitted thai Buchanan had man
j ifested no symptoms of Insanity during
j the five-year period of his Incarceration,
that he was in an improved condition
! .-'inee the time of bis conflnement, yet he
I declared that he believed him to be Incur
', ably insane, and expressed the belief that
j the petitioner, if accorded JusÂ«t cor.sidera
! tion. would never permanently leave the
asylum until be vr \s carried out in bis
coffin. He admitted that he had been
; mistaken in his original opinion of the
j character of Buchanan's maladyâ that he
was not suffering from petit rnal nor noc-
I turnal epilepsyâ and that he had been
I mistaken In passing on the mental condi
tion of patients In the past. He also ad
mitted that he might be mistaken as to
the incurable character of Buchanan's in
sanity.
At one stage of the proceeding the wit
ness became pathetically dramatic. He
wag asksd If he were not agreeably dis
appointed In the improved condition that
Buchanan developed, when he replied:
"Now, Mr. Bell. I have known you a
pood long time, and I do not believe you
or uny other man that has known me* in
timately would believe that 1 would went
an unfortunate human being to become
more insane every day of his life and
live in th- unutterable misery that at
tends that unfortunate condition in or
der to substantiate one poor, little pitiful
opinion that might have been expressed
by me. No: I wish the boy were in a
condition to be discharged and that I
could feel conscientiously that I could
do it."
Attorney Anderson opened the proceed
ings by reading a deposition made by
P. H. Brewster, on attorney of Atlanta,
<;> and which had been rÂ»ad at the
Marysville trial. The deponent testified
that In his opinion Hugh Buchanan was
not mentally sound at the time he lett
Georgia.
After a long argument Dr. Gardner was
put on the stand as a Witness in his own
behalf. Part of his very interesting ex
amination was as follows:
'"When did you iirÂ«' meet Hugh Buch
nnan?"' "I think it was some time In
March or April of 15?4."
"What brought Hugh Buchanan at the
time to your notice? "Mr. Buchanan's
brother. Dr. Stone, and Mr Belcher of
Marysville called at the institution and
Mr. Buchanan said he wished me to go
to Marysville and examine Hugh Bach
anan a? to his sanity."
"What was said in relation to your go
ing there? i should like to hear the exact
facts as to what was said to persuade
you to go see Hugh Buchanan. "The
hmther to some extent told me what he
considered to be the condition of this
man. and after listening to him I told
him that possibly there might be some
Insanity in his brother. He asked me If
I would go and make an examination of
his brother."
"Did he at that time ask you what posi
tion you would take in the case, if the
case should come to trial? Did you or
did you not commit yourself on one side
or the other?" "I did not. I told Mr.
Buchanan that I would go and examine
his brother, provided he would pay for it.
and I reserved the right to pass any opin
ion 1 chose In the matter, but stipulated
that he should pay for my services in
any event."
"Who. were present besides yourself and
Mr. Buchanan?" "Dr. Stone was present,
and I think Mr. Belcher was present, but
I can't remember."
"Tell us the matter of pay." "He asked
me what I would charge and I told him
I should charge him $100 a day either for
testifying or doing any work in the
case."
"Did you Indicate any desire to partici
pate in the ease?" "Not at all. sir."
"When you pay $100 a day. what do you
mean?" "I mean the average number of
hours that anybody would consider a day
if he were doing work."
"What occurred next with reference to
action in connection with the suggestion
thus made?" "I went to Marysville,
probably In Aprilâ it might have been in
Marchâ lSP4, and made the examination of
Hugh Buchanan In the County Jail."
Dr. Gardner further testified that after
making an examination of Hugh Buchan
an's physical condition and questioning
him he made an affidavit to the effect that
he considered there were great probabili
ties that Buchanan was of unsound mind.

FRANCE'S EMBASSADOR
HAS LEFT ENGLAND
Relations Between the Two Countries
Reported to Be in a Critical
Condition.
NEW YORK, Dec. 2.â A World special
from London says: France's Embassa
dor to England. M. Paul Cambon, re
turned to Paris to-day. From Paris comes
the news that the British Embassador to
France, Sir Edmund S. Monson, has ap
plied for a two months' leave of absence.
The departure of the French Embassa
dor, M. Cambon, It Is believed. is Intended
as a protest against â¢ Colonial Secretary
Chamberlain's Leicester speech. It is said
that he will remain away until some ex
planation or qualification of Chamber
lain's language has been publicly offered
by Lord Salisbury.
The feeling In London Is that the rela
tions between the two countries are in a
critical condition. The World correspond
ent was Informed at the French Embassy
to-night that M. Cambon had left on pri
vate business.
ThÂ© friends of the Old Government
Whisky are never drunkards. â¢
1 Witness related how he had refused to
; {rive any definite opinion regarding Bu
t chanan's mental condition until he had
I all the evidence before him, Including- a
, complete history of the life of the defend
I ant up to the time of the commission of
; the alleged murder at Marysville. He
.next told of the legal proceedingâ the
/ appointment of the lunacy commission, of
j wn.ch he was a member: the verdict of
; the commission, the result of the special
J jury <-tÂ»l)pd to try the question Â«ii insanity
j ana the commitment of Buchanan to the
asylum. Among other things he stated
that the course of Buchanan's attorneys
and oÂ£ his brother, was governed by tne
advice witness gave In the matter of de
termining; the condition of Buchanan's
mind.
The examination then turned on the
question of compensation. It was as fol
low?: "About how many days wer* you
prevent In Mary3vllle during the progreÂ«
of the murder care In which Buchanan
was defendant?" "I think 1 was in
: Marysvillc about five days I had gone
up before that time and spent about three
days iddltlonal when we rather expected
the trial to come off, and I was there two
lays at the time of the examination I
made in the tirst Instance, making in all
ten 'la;--"."
"Summarize the inquiries you made in
dependently. How much time, in your
| opinion, did you devote to these In
quiries?" "I devoted in the neighbor
hood of five day?."
"I think the understanding was that
you should be paid $100 a day?" "Ye 3,
sir. One hundred dollars a day was the
agreement." â¢:.'â 
"How much In all were you paid?" "I
was paid $1500."
Witness admitted that his observation
of Buchanan since his confinement had
forced him to come to the conclusion that
the petitioner had not Buffered from
petit mal or nocturnal epilepsy, and that
his original opinion formed at Marys
vllle was erroneous, but he adhered to his
belief that Buchanan was and is still an
insane man. He also stated that he had
made mistakes in discharging patients as
cured when they were not so in fact. He
added that the greatest burden of a su
perintendent of an asylum is to pass
upon the question of a patient's recovery,
as lie Is held responsible before the peo
ple. "We are, for this reason, very
cautious," he continued, "in discharging
people who have been Insane. We don't
know what effect the new surroundings
will have on them."
Attorney l.lv< mash here submitted the
same hypothetical question, covering Bu
chanan's life history, that had been nut
to Dr. Robertson yesterday. To save time
all the experts were called in to listen to
the reading of the question, which was an
extremely long one. They were Dr. W. V.
Hatch. General Superintendent of the
State Hospitals; Dr. E. E. Stone. Dr. D.
Smith. Dr. J. H. Ban- and Dr. A. W. Hoia
holt. in addition to Dr. Gardner.
After the reading of the question the
other medical experts were excused, and
Dr. Gardner was asked what he consid
ered the mental condition of the man de
scribed.
He answered: "I believe such a person
as represented by the hypothetical ques
tion to be insane, and I don't believe that
such a person will ever recover."
Under the crops-examination of Attor
ney Bell Dr. Gardner admitted that since
his administration the asylum had con
tained in all about 3200 patients; that it
now contains about 1500 patients, and that
from 25 to 27 per cent of the patients are
discharged as recovered. Dr. Doater, the
first assistant physician at the Institution,
he said, came more Intimately In contact
with the patients than himself, and he
usually consult* his assistant physicians
in pronouncing on a patient's right to dis
charge. It was also his custom In difficult
cases to consult with the supervisors, ma
trons or attendants who were In close at
tendance on the patients, hut the life hlp
tory of the patient and other Information
were always taken Into consideration.
He admitted that Buchanan's memory
t* better 'now that It was at MarysvlMe
shortly after the murder, but thought
this might have been due to the fact that
Buchanan might have been suffering
from the effects of alcohol at Marysvllle.
The apparently defective memory "of Bu
chanan was one of the reasons on which
he based his opinion that Buchanan was
Insane. On the suggestion of Bell he ex
amined Buchanan's eyes and stated that
the pupils were less dilated now than
they wore when he examined them at
Mnrysvllle.
Dr. Gardner stated that ho assisted E.
B. Buchanan. Hugh's brother. in framing
the Interrogatories of the depositions tak
en in Georgia and Texas, but disclaimed
that he was most prominent in the work
of devising the Interrogatories.
"Why did you eliminate the factor of
the drinking habit from these Interroga
tories?" asked Attorney Bell.
"Buchanan's brother laid no stress on
his brother's drinking habits. It Is a mat
ter that should always he considered In
determining a question of lnÂ«Â«anltv. I
don't remember whether I asked about it,
but I think it Is very likely I did. There
w*rt'. however, sufficient other data to
indicate insanity In Buchanan's case."
Witness admitted that no attempt wns
made to pet affidavits as to Buchanan's
drinking habits after the matter had been
Interacted Into the case. He further
agreed with Bell that the great change In
thÂ«Â» disposition, habits and mind of Bu
chanan might be explained on the basin
of excessive Indulgence In liquor. Ad
journment was taken until 9 a. m. Thurs
day next.

EXCLUSION OF THE CHINESE

ACTION MADE NECESSARY BY
RACIAL HATRED.
Commanding General Describes the
:pino Uprising in Manila on
the Night of the Second
of February.
I
â¢.!. It
One of the most Interesting features is
the immt-nse amount of detail involved ia
<;Â« neral Otis* administration of the affairs
of the island. General Otis throws some
light on his Chinese exclusion act. declar
ing It .x matter of public policy. He goes
ct fenÂ« length into the racial differences
between thÂ«- Filipinos and the Chinese.
â¦ xplainlng that strong prejudice against
t:.e ChlneM prevailed among the natives
l>^cau?e of the success and unscrupulous
doings of Chinese in all trade matters.
General Otis fays that in view of the race
hatred between the Chinese and the na
liven as will as the factional differences
f.mor.R the. Chinese themselves, which
t-omettmes broke out Into riot and blood
Â»=hÂ»-d, he Â«3e*med it expedient to apply the,
American immigration laws to the island.
This uajÂ» done and arrangements hayÂ©
tven made for Identifying such Chinese as
have receipts of prior residence, so that
r.o unnecessary hardship may be worked.
The correspondence between General
Oil* and Aguinaido before the outbreak of
active hostilities receives much space, and
non is taken up with the detailed ac
counts of the various engagements. In
connection with the Filipino uprising in
the suburbs of Manila on the night of
February -. General ous prints the trans
lation of one of Aguinaido' s proclamations
which incited this demonstration. The
paper finally was discovered on the 15th
and the plans of the insurgents were
checkmated. It called for thÂ» assembling
<>f the Manila military In the rear of the
American outposts. At tho round of at
tack fr<<m the outside the Insurgents were
to fall In an<l butcher the whole of the
firclpn j>opulatlon. respecting none but
native Filipino families. All the prisoner*
were to be released and armed to assist
In the massacre. The plans were success
ful In Â»o far as about luut) armed Insur
pÂ«-nta assembled behind the American
line. In the light of that night and the
following day about &>u of these were
killed.
General Otis relate* minutely the diffi
culties encountered In dealing with the
foreign merchants whose business was
Interfered with by the war; the outlining
of plans of revenues and customs; the
negotiation* with the Sultan of Sulu. from
whom, he says. General Hates obtained
more concession* in a month than Spain
had been able to obtain In 3Â«Â» years; the
Institution of town governments; the es
tablishment of schools and the caring for

"Animal food, unless mixed with at
least four-fifths of vegetable products.
Is apt to produce Irritable temper and
chronic restlessness. Wherever experi-
ments have succeeded in accustoming
horses to a diet of flesh food, the re-
pults were attested by 'torn bridles and
smashed stable doors. Carnivorous men
begin to prowl to ease the feeling of
gastric discomfort, and if deprived
of that remedy become fretful and
vindictive, especially when the causes
of nervous derangements have been
complicated by other stimulants."

In concluding his report General Otis
says that It may prove fortunate that
Aguinildo's Insurrection was not stamped
out Instantly upon Its Inception. He says
the natives throughout the Island have
peacefully and even gladly accepted
American occupation of â  heir towns, and
have learned by experience that the in
rargenta have made a specialty of mur
der, outrage and robbery under the pulse
or establishing: a free and Independent
government. They have had a chance up
on the withdrawal of the American troops
to see the difflerence between American
and native methods of government, and
his opinion is that they will gladly sub
mit to the former as soon as they in be
protected from the latter. A column of
Â».Â«Â¥) troops, he says, could at any time
during the insurrection have marched
from one end of the island to the other
without encountering serious difficulty,
but the insurgents would Inevitably have
closed in behind them a - soon as they
passed, showing the necessity of having
sufficient troops to hold the country after
it had been captured.
General Otis dwells upon the necessity
of establishing a good school system, and
says that the native population is very
insistent upon the divorce of the schools
from clerical control. This was prom
ised by the Spanish Government during
the last Insurrection, but the Archbishop
of Manila has protested against its be
ing carried out.
General Otis says, finally, that the in
surgents are duped by their leaders as to
the political situation, and that the tend
ency all along has been to hold out until
the assembling of Congress, when the
vie-.vs of the anti-expansion party, whose
literature has been extensively circulated
in the islands, would be sure to prevail.

Decides Unanimously to Re-enact the Reed

:i la-Sting almost two hOIII
publicans, without a dissenting \oie, de
cided to re-enact the Reed ru.
General David B. Henderson of lowa,
the unopposed candidate, was nominated
for Speaker by acclamation. The officer*
of the last House, except Colonel Russell,
the sergeant at arms, were renominated
without opposition. Colonel Russell was
not a candidate for re-election, and Col
onel Henry A. Casson at Wisconsin was
nominated In his stead.
The caucus was held in the House of
Representatives and was largely attended.
It was presided over by General Gros
venor of Ohio, who was re-elected chair
man of the caucus. Mr. Loudenslager of
New Jersey was re-elected secretary. Mr.
Henderson's name was presented by Mr.
Payne of New York, and seconded by Mr.
Hopkins of Illinois, both of whom had
been candidates originally. The roll was.
not called. The nomination was made by
acclamation. General Henderson came to
the Capitol and remained in the Speaker's
room in the rear of the House lobby until
the House officers had been selected. He
was then escorted to the rostrum of the
House by Messrs. Hopkins of Illinois,
Payne of New York and Sherman of New
York. His appearance was greeted with
cheers and in response General Hender
son addressed the caucus. After express
ing his deep appreciation of the honor
conferred upon him, he said:
We have great responsibilities resting 1 upon
us In this Congress and greater responsibilities
In â¢>..â > comics year, and upon our wise action
depends the prosperity of -the country that we
all love. May I Impress upon your mlnjÂ« the
absolute necÂ«-**lty for devotion to the republic
In more than one purpose. Economy must be
our watchwordâ care In th? expenditure of the
people's money. At the same time let us be
large enough in Intellect to croup the situation
which presents a growing Country, with open-
Ing and expanding conditions which demand
our careful and patriotic coni>io>rati..n
We are going to be met by a well organized
and able minority, led by accomplished lead
ers. This Involves the necessity for the Re
publicans to touch elbows In the work before
us. We have got to realize that In this Con
gress, with our small majority, every man
like a true soldier, must be constantly at his
port of duty, and I urge with the greatest
earnestness that this be the determination of.
each and all.
Accepting this generous nomination a* I do
I have no fears but that the united wisdom
and work of this great body will Increase the
confidence and happiness of the republic. Pro
foundly and gratefully. i thank you 'i ask
that 1 may lean upon youâ each one of youâ
and that Is the highest request that I can make
to-night.
Mr. Payne of New York called attention
to the narrow majority in the House and
the necessity of having all the Republi
cans throughout the session. He offend
a resolution, which was adopted, that no
leaves of absence be granted except for
vugu u ge ?i cases, and that one member
should be appointed to look after the
pairs.
Mr. Dalzell of Pennsylvania, who was a
member of the Committee on Rules in the
last Congress, offered a resolution declar
ing it to be the sense of the caucus that
the rules of the Fifty-fourth and Fi'ty
llfth Congresses (the Reed rules) should
be adopted by the incoming House. Ho
made a speech of considerable length In
support of his resolution. Under the
operations of the rules of the last two
Congresses, he argued, the majority had
been able to transact business to its sat
isfaction and to the satisfaction of the
country. They were the only rules un
der which the House had been able to
do business.
Mr. Hepburn of lowa, who fought the
rules in the last Congress, attempted to
argue several points with Mr. Dalzel)
but the latter refused to yield. When he
had concluded, however. Colonel Hep
burn got the floor and attacked the reso
lutions. He insisted that the rules should
be modified. He laid particular stress
upon the question of recognition, which
he claimed should go to the first member
who addressed the chair. This has been
one of Mr Hepburn's causes of com
plaint in preceding Congresses. He con
tended that the Committee on Rules
should be entirely Independent of the
Speaker and that there should be a gen
eral decentralization of power from
the Speaker in the direction of commit-,
tees.
The Speaker and the Committee on
Rule*, he contended, had too much power
under the rules proposed to be adopted
The power of committees and Individuals
should be expanded. He proposed an
amendment to the resolution providing
that the rules should bo adopted for forty

Tennesseean Wins on the Sixth Bal-

Democrats.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 2.â The Democrats
of the House of Representatives at t!iÂ»-lr
caucus held in the hall of Representatives
this afternoon selected James D. Richaxd-
Fnn of Tennessee as their candidate for
Speaker after a spirited contest, which

with it the I>. mocratlc leadership on the

souri, Bunkhead of Alabama and riulzÂ«.r
vt New York.
Representative Hay of Virginia was
elected chairman of the caucus by a vote
of 77 to 62 cast for McÃae of ArkaJ:.-u~. It
has been customary for the oldest mem
ber in point of service to preside over the
caucus, and the selection of Mr. Hay,
who has served only one term, was an
unusual honor. The name of Mr. Norton
of Ohio was also presented for presiding
officer, but was withdrawn. Representa
tive Cummlngs of New York and Robert
son of Louisiana were elected secretaries.
Mr. Richardson was placed In nomination
by Mr. lienton of Missouri. Mr. Bank
h> ad was nominated by Mr. Bali of Texas,
and Mr. Sulzer was nominated by Mr!
Cummin its of New York.
The nrst ballot resulted: Richardson
43, DeArmond 35*. Bankhead 34 and Sulzer
25. The following four ballots showed lit
tle change. At the end of the tifth ballot
Mr. I nderwood of Alabama, withdrew Mr.
Bankhead'q name, and on the tirst roll
ca.. of the sixth ballot about two-thirds
>'f Mr. Bankhead's supporters went to
Richardson At the end of this ballot
â¢Mr. Richardson had 05, DeArmond 45 and
Sulzer 20.
Before the second rollcall began Mr
Sulzer withdrew and asked his friends to
vote for Richardson. There was a general
stampede to the Tennesseean and he was
nominated on the sixth ballot, receiving
9>) votes against 47 for DeArraond and -
for Sulzer. The nomination was then
made unanimous.
Mr. Richardson, who was in the Ways
and Means committee room, was escorted
to the hall and made a felicitous speech,
thanking his colleagues lor the honor they
had conferred upon him. Owing to the
lateness of the hour, he said, he would do
no more than to return his profound
thanks, trusting he had an appreciation
of the great responsibilities placed upon
him by the action of the caucus. His
highest ambition, he said, would be to
rn^et these responsibilities and discharge
them so as to meet the approbation of
the Democrats of the House and the coun
try. His greatest regret was that the re
sult of his victory would bring disappoint
ment, which he hoped would be only tem
pi, rary. to other gentlemen aspiring to the
trying position to which he had been
chosen.
He could hope for success only with the
cordial and hearty co-operation of each
member. In concluding he said he hoped
that the members would be ready to give
him the co-operation he would have been
glad to glvÂ« another had the result of the
caucus been different.
The following candidates for House of

wings, and was not bothered by following
any particular machine. He maintained
his lead until the end of the twelfth mile

SAYS DALY WANTED AN
ITALIAN SONIN-LAW
Woman Claims the Montana Offered
Her a Commission to Arrange
the Match.
PARIS, Dec. 2.â Tempestuous gossip has
been excited here by the rather Inconsid
erate boast of Mrs. Stewart Taylor that
she has been promised a quarter of a mil
lion dollars as a commission by Marcus
Daly, the Anaconda copper king, to
match his daughter Madge with a cer
tain Italian Prince. Mrs. Taylor spoke
thus before a gathering of ten or twelve
ladles in Armand's fashionable dress
making establishment.
It had been generally understood that
Miss Madge Daly was engaged to Dr.
Archibald Ryckert, a handsome American
dentist with a fashionable clientele. Mar
cus Daly began to oppose the match dur
ing his visit here last summer.
The Italian Prince is aged and has a
rather unsavory reputation in Paris and
Rome, where be has been a leading figure
in several social adventures.
Marcus Daly's friends -ay that he has
too much American common sense to
have intended the remark to Mrs. Taylor
to be taken seriously.

Terror reigns In the ChlneÂ«o quarter. A

at 612 Pine street, by the See Yups and
twelve highbinder societies. Police pro

threatened merchants have fled from the
city. A murder has been scheduled to
take place In the Chinese theater on

I The condition of affairs now existing in
I Chinatown has been caused by the failure

FRENCH SOCIETY
ON VERGE OF A
LIVELY FRACAS
Sequel of Hospital
Scandals.
A PRETTY QUARREL BREWING
A Mass-Meeting to Be Held This
Afternoon, at Which Some Ex
citing Tilts May Be
Expected.
There will be a mass meeting of th<*
French Society held at Native Sons' Hall
en Mapon street at 1 o'clock this after
noon to Investigate the recent action of
the administration committee of the
French Hospital, which resulted In that
body declaring the position of visiting
physician, recently held by Dr. Oscar J.
M >â â¢ â¢ i vacant.
Mfhind this action of the administration
committee lies as pretty a medical squab
ble as one would wish to see.
According to the story of those opposed
tÂ«i l>r. Mayer that gentleman has been
guilty of the very unprofessional con
duct of first stealing a case from Dr.
Nathan Rodffen and subsequently
Ing the same ease from the hospital of
which he was one of the two visiting phy-
Blciana, the other one being Dr. Dudley
T;.it.
According to Dr. Mayer, this is all bosh.
,ilms ho has h<Â»en the unfortunate
victim of a conspiracy Instigated by the
Jealousy of Dr. Talt and the animosity
of Vi Pi - â  :.t churiery, and that Di.
I n lias been used as a tool b>
two gentlemen to further their own re
veriKe.
In the conduct of the French Hospital
factional feeling and personal likes and
h have always played a large part.
There has hardly been a physician con-
nected with the Institution who, at one
time or another, hus not been made to
feel the right 01 this discord. Dr. Mayer
was an exception to the general rule un
til Dr. Talt was elected as his collabora
tor, since which time there have been
frequent bickerings and rows that have
finally resulted in Dr. Mayer losing his
position and calling for vindication at the
hands of the society in mass meeting as
sembled to-morrow afternoon.
The Immediate cause of the doctor's
expulsion is as follows: Some time ago.
the latter part of September, a woman
was brought to the hospital suffering
from an aggravated case of peritonitis.
Sho was brought In as the patient of Dr.
Nathan Rodgers. by whom she had been
previously attended. As soon as she had
been admitted to the hospital she ex
pressed a desire to discharge her former
medical adviser and substitute Dr. Mayer.
To this proposition Dr. Mayer objected,
and the matter was finally arranged by
Drs. Mayer and Rodgers together attend
ing the woman.
Finally It became necessary to perform
an operation, and Dr. Mayer was the phy
sician chosen to do the work by the
woman, Dr. Rodgers agreeing to assist
at the work. At the appointed hour Dr.
Rodgers did not turn up and Dr. Mayer
performed the operation by himself.
The woman subsequently died leaving
a will in which she appointed Mayer to
administer her estate without bonds.
Shortly after the woman's demise Dr.
Mayer was called Into the presence of
Vice President Chartery and Informed
that charges had been preferred against
him for unprofessional conduct by Dr.
Rodgers and was asked to give an ex
planation. This he started to do, but. be
coming excited, struck his fist violently
on the table and refused to answer cer
tain questions put to him unless he Wai
given an opportunity to explain the cir
cumstances surrounding the matter on
which he was interrogated. This he was
not allowed to do and the meeting re
united In the physician leaving the room
without any satisfactory conclusion being
arrived at by the committee who sat with
Chartery.
Dr. Mayer heard nothing further of the
matter until he received a letter several
weeks ago notifying him that he had
been discharged from his position rs
visiting physician to the hospital beraus*
of the unparliamentary and discourteous
manner In which he had behaved while
before the committee.
There is a law In the statutes of the
French society that makes it possible for
any one who feels himself aggrieved to
demand an investigation before a mass
meeting of members of the society If hi
can pet 200 signatures to a petition de
manding the same. This Dr. Mayer has
succeeded in doing and the meeting will
take place as above mentioned.
Dr. Mayer blames all his troubles on the
professional jealousy of Dr. Talt. which
has been helped along by the 111-will of
Vice President Chartery consequent upon
a row which occurred between that gen-

"Ever sit," paid Mr. Goblinton, "late at

house, the whole city, quiet, and see, pres

of the room, a door opening slowly?
That's a hair-raising experience. You
don't know by what means the knowledge
that It was opening was first conveyed
to you. but you see it now. opening slowly
and steadily and silently, and you get up
and grasp the chair in which you have
been sitting, and stand up. with the table
between you and him for further protec

"Presently you fln>.l the door open again,

LONDON. Dec. 2â Mr. Chamberlain's

only thrown the capitals of Europe into
a turmoil, but his declarations have beer.

Mr. Chamberlain only told the truth, for
in the dispatches of November 25. It wÂ«a

for an alliance looking for a settlement

1 the Chinese Minister, It is presumed that I
the United States, at any rate, as yet baa
â  not decided to claim any sphere in China.
i According to opinion here Secretary
Hay's denial was to be expected at this
stage, and whether or not It correctly
forecasts the attitude of the United
States. It is not regarded as dissipating
the belief that the "open door" is now
the basis of negotiations between the ,
powers, far more comprehensive than
mere answers to the United States' re- \
â  Quests for assurance*.
In addition to being the center of at
traction in Europe's excitement over
mooted alliances, Mr. Chamberlain occu
pies the center of the stage In the
French-British dispute. His official rec
ognition of tne French press diatribes and
throat of retaliation made in his Leices
| ter speech have Incurred the censure of
many of his own supporters, while his ut
terances irritated France almost to an
; alarming extent.
The speakei declares Mr. Chamberlain's
j head has been turned by his Interview
' with Emperor William and expresses tho
hope that the French nation will not
â  forget that he. is not yet Foreign Secre
tary.
The fact that the French naval attache,
speaking at the Temple Yacht Club din
ner, simultaneously with Mr. Chamber
lain, emphatically disowned before Ad
miral Beresford and the other attaches
and 700 prominent Britons, the attacks on
the Queen, has rendered Mr. Chamber
lain's notice of them more striking. The
Associated Press learns that the French
naval attache's speech was revised by the
French Kmbassmlor and was made at his
personal request.
The conservative French papers con
trast Mr. Chamberlain's remarkable ut
terances with those of Admiral Beresfori.
who, following the French naval attache,
declared that a few caricaturists could
not be taken to represent a nation.

berlain who eommanda. "We would as
suredly have desired to preserve peace
but the Minister who leads Great Britain
wants war, which Is, consequently, in
evitable."
This extract from the Autorite voices
the extreme tone. The Petit Parislen be
lieves Mr. Chamberlain tried to throw
dust Into the eyes of the British public
in order to avoid attention attracted to
the defeats in South Africa.
Thus the Colonial Secretary has stirred
up a hornet's nest. In marked contrast
to his line of action Is that of M. del
Caaee, whose moderate speeches and
statesmanlike references to the Trans
vaal, receive the warmest commendation
fr.m all sections of the British press,
though several firms have announced that
they have withdrawn their exhibits from
the Paris Exposition on account of
French enmity.

SAN RAFAEL. Dec. 2.â The United
States Smokeless Powder Company has
reconsidered Its determination to estab
lish a plant In Contra Costa County and
will again locate on the old site near the
Ban Rafael golf links or at Point San

Mtva the preference on account of tho
fact that water can be secured there In
greater quantltien and at far less expense
than on the old site.
It Is proposed to establish a dynamite
and nitroglycerin plant, which means
the outlay of half a million dollars. The
final determination not to remove from
Marln County means a good deal for the
laborers of this part of the State, as sev

BUBONIC PLAGUE
CARRIED TO KOBE
Three Deaths Have Been
Reported.

Correspondence of the Associated Press.
YOKOHAMA., Nov. 16.â The bubonic
plague has made Its entry into Japan.
five undoubted cases having been reported
at Kobe, three already proving fatal. The
pest is traced to cotton Imported from
China, the original buyer, the carrier and
the purchaser of the stuff being the three
victims. Much dismay prevails in the in
fected city and the most drastic measures
are being taken by the authorities. A
hundred houses are Isolated and a corps
of the most eminent physicians In the em
pire has been dispatched to the scene
with full powers. Much confidence is
placed In Dr. Kitasto. a pupil of Dr. Koch,
who. In his researches and discoveries In
bacteriology, has well nigh surpassed his
master. In spite, however, of these reas
surances, much consternation prevails
and traveling In the direction of Kobe is
receiving a severe check.
A striking illustration of the sensitive
ness of the Japanese anent the Russian
encroachments in Korea is to be found in
the fact that although it was perfectly
well known that the autumn maneuvers
of the army were to be held this week yet

begun.
Trouble Is brewing under the new treat
ies In the matter of taxation. They pro
vided that foreign owners of real estate
should not be subject to any deprivation
of the prlvileÃes they enjoyed under the
old regime. The <;overnment holds, how
ever, that the I'Ull.lm^s on the lanil are
not real estate and that they are there
fore subject to the Japanese house tax.
which has now been levied.
Out of some 270 foreigners thus taxed
only forty-three have paid, under protest,
and tho QVWtfiHI has been put into the
hands of the foreign Ministers for adjust
ment. There are Indications that what
ever may be the decisions of the home
governments, the authorities will adhere
firmly to the position they have taken
and will enforce the tax.
The future Empress of Japan has been
chosen and her engagement to the Crown
Prince announced. She will have a dowry
of a million and a quarter yen from
her own family and from the Emperor,
the latter contributing the larger portion
of the sum. It may he significant that by
this marriage the Crown Prince will be
come related to the highest Buddhist
priest In the empire. In view of the strong
Buddhistic movement to secure state rec
ognition, this fact is commented upon as
o( gn-at Interest.
Predictions are freely made that the
coming session of the Parliament will re
sult In a brt-ak-up of the prosent minis
try. The Liberal party, through alliance
with which the CftDlnct has been enabled
to carry Its measures, is in a state of
chaos. Two of its leaders have resigned,
while another has been making Insistent
demands for spoils In the .shape of minis
terial appointments In return for party
service. The civil service Question Is thus
being brought to the front as prominently
as It is in the T'nlted States.
The Government has decided to build

The occasion is well worth celebrating. By a series
of fortunate circumstances the evolution of California
lias been made the most romantic feature of American
history. Almost even.' event in the progressive civil
ization of this State from its earliest settlement to its
admission to the Union has had about it that charm
of adventure, of fortune, of mystery or of strife
which renders it perennially interesting to mankind,
and particularly to its own people. All the circum
ftanccs of the stirring time from the raising of the
bear itag to the final settlement of the controversy in
Conprcss over the admission of the territory to the
rights of statehood are notable not only for them
selves but for the kind of men they brought to the
front. It is a drama full of character as well as of
incident, and whatever serves to recall the memory
of those times and those men is of value to the com
munity.

SOUND MONEY OPFOSED.
WHEN one is determined to create a reason
where no good one exists the task is easy.
Invention can always be substituted for fact,
and if others are misled thereby the purpose is ac
complished. The Chronicle is opposed to the sound
money measures which it is hoped this Congress will
speedily pass. It has seen in those measures a viola
tion of the Republican platform of 1896, and a new
departure in what is really a full return to a well
seasoned policy. The platform of 1896 promised an
effort to secure international bimetallism, whatever
that is. The experiment was tried in good faith by
the President. A commission of silver men. includ
ing Adlai Stevenson, former Vice President, and
Senator Wolcott of Colorado, was appointed and
made a comprehensive canvass of every European
Cabinet and discussed the question with the finance
Ministers of all the European Governments which
might usefully co-operate. None was found friendly
to the proposition nor tolerant of another coinage and
ratio congress after the failure of all that had been
held. There being no prospect of any international
action, should the Republican party ignore the pos
session of a majority in Congress, elected specifically
upon pledges in the several States to enact pending
legislation, or should it go ahead in line with the
victor)' it won on sound money in 1806?
If it refuse to use its present majority to redeem
the pledges which secured it. what will it do next
year? Will it project international bimetallism into
the next campaign or redeem its promise of pound
money by making another and raising against itself
an issue of frivolity and bad faith?
The Chronicle is void of advice as to what should
be d.'Tie next year if this legislation fail. It. like the
very few party papers which stand with it, does not
make any promise t<> support a perfectly sound money
plank in the next platform. They will all probably
r advocating a plank to the effect that a pro-
Ettled the money question, and that
-ue is eliminated from the campaign.
Aj the Chronicle denies the need of financial re
form its policy is to accuse the reformers of creating
a necessity. To this end it sayi that the recent re
demption t : SiS.non.ooo of bonds by the treasury to
pot money in circulation and relieve financial strin
gency i* a plot <>f the sound money men. intended to
manufacture the appearance of a ncce-<ity fur estab*
lishi: . â¢ Lttdard This is a harmful accusa
tion against the Secretary of the Treasury and the
President himself, ni;ce the Secretary -.vould not i<
sunie to redeem or to is*ue bonds under any ex
law without the approval of the President.
Hut is it true that such redemption of bonds can
have any nation whatever to "the endless chain" or
to any financial legislation to better existing condi-
Ibviously it is not. Our statutes of finance,
complex and vexatious, bear no relation to the re
demption of bonds at all. They afflict the treasury
not through its bonded obligations, but by means of
the Boating debt, i:i greenbacks proximately and
other ncy mediately, for the redemption
of which the treasury is obligated. If any one had
want i plot, such as the Chronicle charges.
old have been in the form of presenting $18,000.
000 in greenba -rdemption, which under ex
law would have to be reigned, and not in re
â¢ng that amount in bonds which are imme
diately and finally canceled and forever paid.
Such presentation of greenbacks would have set the
endless chain in motion to drain the treasury oi gold
lit the cancellation of a dollar of the public debt.
The Secntnry of the Treasury has simply paid for
the people that much of the interest-bearing public
; nd has saved them the interest thereon. Had
he redeemed greenbacks for immediate reissue he
would have pail no debt and saved no inter* I
More than this, he would have probably entered upon
a process which would have reduced the gold reserve
to a point at which the sale of more bonds would
have been required to replenish it. as was contem
plated by the Harrison administration and was twice
eveland to maintain the sol
vency of the treasury and uphold the national credit.
That the Chronicle should make such a charge or
imply or insinuate it is evidence of the length to
which the unsound money faction in the party is
willing to go to prevent the reforms which it has
: ised.
The i>r â  for that faction is with Rrym
and Hogg.

of thÂ«- road hold up their hands and swear they can

body to blame except the public.
DIPLOMATIC RESERVE.
TH F. opinion is rapidly growing in this country
that llmbassador Choatc may usefully practice
more diplomatic reserve. The American lega
tion in London i? not maintained as a gushery, anj
after-dinner speeches need not be used as an occasion
for discussion fp f grave international problems which
-m the peace of the world. Much is said about
Britisli sympathy and support for us in the Spanish
war. Our people take it for granted that we had
both, and it has passed into the fixed convictions of
the American nnrid that Rngland kept Continental
Europe off our backs during that brief struggle. But
none can recall any public expression to that effect
uttered by Sir Julian Patmcefote. the British Emhai
at Washington. lie may have had all the sym
pathy of a cousin or a brother-in-law, or other things
in-hnv, but lie kept it to himself. It is true that the
two South African republics are not known diplo
matically to the other nations, including our own, and
it is also true that among the great monarchies of
pc there is but little sympathy with the repub
lics, while there may be much hatred of Great
Britain. In this country there is not that general
â¢ion of hatred Of England, but Americans sym
pathy with the republics and devoutly hope for their
â¢ :y.
Therefore it is an excess of politeness and a stir
plni Â«if COOStnhood in Mr. Choate to say that while
<tir Government i* neutral our people are not, and
that American women especially cannot be restrained
in their expression of inpport of England.
Mr. St. John Gaffney. in the Albany (X. V.) Time?,
â¢ tl II it the recent pro-Boer meeting in
New York City a dozen Governors of States ami
â¢iver a hundred members of Congress telegraphed
their sympathy with the Boers, and he very pointedly
challenges the New York Tribune, which is pro-
British, to call a meeting in New York to express
sympathy with Great Britain and test the condition of
American sentiment.
The agents of American expression, diplomatic and
alistic. owe it to their country no less than *.o
Great Britain to tell the truth about American senti
ment. They have no right to deceive that empirp
about the sentiment of this republic. Already British
statesmen, relying on what Mr. Choate says and the
Tribune and other American papers publish, are
talking about a concert of England, Germany and the
United States, a new tripartite alliance which is to be
TIIE SAN FRANCTSCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 3. 1899.
stride the world like a three-legged Colossus. Now
there is not in this country any public sentiment to
support such an extravagant expectation.
We have done very well without any European al
liances, and we believe it to be the sincere purpose of
our people to continue without any such entangle
ment.
The royal families of England and Germany are
blood kin, and may foregather as seems meet for their
dynamic purposes, but we will not lightly abandon
our position as a republic, which is a free agent and
keeps a free hand as to all the rest of the world. If
we are pursuing some outside purpose which would
make such alliance necessary we would better aban
don ft than seek to tie our hands in order to accom
plish it.
THE CAMPAIGN FOR PROGRESS.
y~y ETWEEN now and the dates when the special
\\ elections of next month are to be held a cam
â paign of education on behalf of progress will be
carried on in San Francisco. It will require two-thirds
of the persons voting to carry the proposed measures.
That is a heavy handicap in favor of silurianism, but
it need not depress the ardor of citizens of public
spirit. On the contrary it should rouse them to
earnest action and induce every one of them to give
some portion of his time and his energies toward
assisting in the campaign and helping to form a reso
lute popular sentiment in favor of the proposed im
provements.
It is very well known that when no definite meas
ure of improvement is before the people as a matter
of practical politics, everybody is in favor of progress,
but as soon as some particular plan is brought for
ward there is a swift revulsion of feeling on the part
of the non-progressive or fault-finding classes, and
they begin at once to assail the plan. It is the old
story that mankind is divided into two classes, one
cf which goes ahead and does something and the
Â«.iher Â«its around and complains because it was not
in some other way. It is in San Francisco as
in other localities. Many a man who professes loudly
his desire for municipal progress will oppose the im
provements now suggested either because he does not
like some detrul of the plan, or because he would
like to see some other improvement made first.
The opposition that will come from that class of
people is rot to be despised. They will go to the
â â¢â¢â¢nving their devotion to progress and then vote
against taking any step toward it. If more than one
tl;ird of the voters who cast their ballots at the elec
tion I pc of that disposition the measures will be de
feated. The duty of progressive citizens is therefore
clmr. They must work diligently from now until the
clmsc of the elections to awaken the interest of their
friends and acquaintances in the issue and confirm
them in a resolve to vote and to vote right when the
time comes.
In a campaign of this kind it is not required that
any man should give much of his time to the work.
It will be sufficient if he make it a point to bring the
subject up in the course of conversation at the
clubs, on the streets and wherever men meet and have
rtunitiea f<>r di*cu=sing public affairs. Personal
influence is much greater than most men suppose. As
a rule the maÂ«s of rren are more or less indifferent to
issues which do not concern their personal fortunes.
Therefore any man who has a decided conviction on
a subject of public rather than private interest, who
talks of it in a persuasive and persistent way, never
f;iils to bring over to his view of the question a con
siderable number of those who were without definite
opinions about it. The men who exert their in
fluence in that way become strong factors in the com
munity and are of value to it. By such men the cam
paign of education should be made in this instance.
If every staunch friend of progress in San Francisco
will do his Â«hare the necessary two-thirds vote will
be given for the improvements proposed at each )(
the two elections and the city will begin the new era
by work which will go far to assure the bright fu
ture that all expect.
REPORTS from Washington are to the effect
that efforts more strenuous than ever are to be
made this winter to obtain from Congress
some action in regard to providing suitable accom
modations for the President. The White House was
ample for the needs of the chief executive in the days
when it was erected, but with the growth of the re
public the clerical force attached to the Presidential
- has increased, the number and extent of state
entertainments have augmented, and in other ways
a need has arisen ior more room than the old man
sion affords.
By way of forming popular sentiment on the sub
ject and rousing Congress to action some doleful
tales are told of the condition of the structure and
the dangen which threaten when large crowds are
assembled there. According to these stories the old
timbers were evidently not laid with a view to inch
a Mrain, and bends and breaks have occurred from
time to time till certain parts of the interior of the
building are relics of ingenious patchwork. The
main staircase gave way in President Arthur's time,
and had to be tied into place with chains, which tra
dition says are still doing duty, hidden in a partition.
A beam under one of the doorways through which
hundreds of persons sometimes pass in a day crackel
several years ago and had to be reinforced with metnt
plates and bolts. It is said an enterprising mechanic,
who attached the cold-air box to the present heating
apparatus, finding one of the masonry arches in the
cellar in his way, cut through it to save a deflection,
thus making it necessary to put in a less satisfactory
support after his trick had been discovered. It is,
moreover, asserted to be an open secret in Washing
ton that the floors of the parlors and state corridors
always have to be sustained by rows of temporary
wooden piers when the President holds his receptions.
That some improvement is needed all parties are
agreed, but there are wide differences of opinion as to
what form the improvement should take. One party
advocates the enlargement of the present structure by
the addition of another range of buildings of equal
length fronting the present one and connected with it
by pavilions so as to inclose a cottft; another set pro
poses the addition of spacious wingl extending to the
right and the left of the building, one to serve as the
private apartments of the President and hisl family
the other for grand state balls and banquets, while the
old building is reserved for the executive offices; but
a third party urges the erection of a new mansion on
a new site in the residence part of the city.
These differences of opinion have long been among
the causes for delay in making the required improve
ment. They may have that effect again, but for once
the Washington people seem inclined to settle upon
one of the three plans and urge it with united force.
Of the three it is likely that which advocates a man
sion on a new site will be chosen, as it has the ad
vantage of affording a chance to improve real estate
values in a new locality as well as of adding another
stately edifice to the many which now make Washing
ton from an architectural point of view one of the
most splendid capitals in the world.
WHITE MOUSE PLANS.
MUST TAKE CIVIL SERVICE EXAMINATIONS.
Henry N. Clemen', Replying to George D. Squires, Says the Law Clearly Provides for Temporary Appoint
ments, but Examinations Will Be Necessary if Appointees Want to Keep Their Places.
The Call does not hold Itself responsible for the
oplrlons published In this column, but pre
sents them for whatever value they may
have as communications of general Interest.
Editor The Call: In a recent Issue of
ynur paper there was a communication
from George D. Squires, a lawyer of this
city. In which Mr. Squires sought to dem
onstrate to the general public the legal
proposition that the civil service law In
the charter would prove to be inoperative
as to the deputies, clerks and employes
first appointed by the heads of depart
ments and officers to take office under the
charter January S, 1900. Either purposely
or unwittingly Mr. Squires failed to make
mention, in his communication, of the
\ery clause of the civil service law which
avowedly makes the law operative and
applicable to the first appointees. The
omission seemed to me bo flagrunt and
inexcusable that I replied to Mr. Squires'
communication, not for the purpose of cn
terlng into a newspaper controversy with
him upon a question of law (for such con
troversies are always barren of practical
results), but solely for the purpo.se of
culling attention to the conspicuous ab
sence of any mention by him of the par
ticular section of the civil service law
which provides for the temporary ap
pointment by the new city and county of
'â â â  â  rs of deputies, clerks and employes to
act until such time as regular appoint
ment* can be made under the civil service
act.
Instead of gratefully accepting and wel
coming my correction of his really lnex
j disable omission. In the cause of truth,
bÂ« proceeded (.as all newspaper controver
sialists do) to resent my kindly intended
correction as an "interference," to refer
to me cuniewhat Irrelevantly as a "candi
date" for Civil Service Commissioner "at
the hands of Mayor Pnelan" (which I am
not), ami to what he ambiguously t.-r m -.
"uncover" me as "the author of the civil
service 'botch." (Whatever odium may
be attached to this last charge will be en
dured with becoming fortitude.)
1 had not thought of replying at all to
Mr. Squires, for I have not time to write
law briefs for publication; but during the
past week 1 have had many requests from
prominent chizens and from two county
oflicers-elect asking me to set forth fully
and clearly my views of the civil service
law as to its applicability to the new ap
pointees; and 1 will therefore, with your
permission, reply to Mr. Squires' conimu
nicatlon on that subject.
Mr. Squires claims In his communica
tion that the clause of section li) ot the
civil service article quoted in my brief
letter to The Call '"has no application
whatever to the case," and asks why 1 i\u
ii>>t "proceed to elaborate a. theory of
construction by which the civil service
provisions of the charter can be made to
apply tM appointments conferred by the
beads of the city government on Janu
ary s."
New to "elaborate a theory of con
struction' implies a precedent obscurity
and presupposes an ambiguity. If the
language of a law is plain we are not
called upon to invoke the rules of con
struction in order to know what it means.
It is not for me or for those whose
duty It shall be to enforce the civil serv
ice law, but It will be for Mr. Squires
on behalf of bis clients, "the push," to
"elaborate a theory of construction"
which will enable THEM to overthrow
and defeat the object and purpose of the
law.
One of the fundamental rules of con
struction is that If there arises a doubt
as to the meaning of a law it must be
read ami construed as a whole so as to
accomplish, if possible, the legislative
purpose and Intent in Its adoption.
Applying this fundamental rule of con
struction to the civil service law we timl
In every provision and In all parts of It
the Intention plainly expressed that ail
the deputies, clerks and employes of the
city and county government shall be sub
ject to civil service examinations, and
that those first temporarily selected will
retain their positions only until such time
as appointments can be made under the
civil service rules.
In the first place, section 36. article XVI
of the charter provides that the M .>â  r
shall, between December 1. IV.*.'. and Janu
ary 1, 1900, appoint the commissioners.
The commissioners, when appointed, will
have full authority to enforce and carry
out the provisions of the civil service act
at the hour ol noon on January \ i>Â»>.
Simultaneously with the civil service com
missioners going into office all the Other
heads of departments and officers will go

Section 10 of the civil service law au
thorizes the heads of departments and
officers, with the approval of the civil
service commissioners, to make immedi
ate temporary appointments as follows:
"TO PREVENT THE STOPPAGE OF
PUBLIC BUSINESS or to meet extraor
dinary exigencies the head of any depart
ment or office may. WITH THE AP
PROVAL OF THE COMMISSIONERS,
make TEMPORARY appointments, to re
main in force not exceeding sixty days,
and ONLY until REGULAR appoint
ments. UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF
THIS ARTICLE CAN BE MADE."
What language could be plainer than
this? To what state of facts does it ap
ply? Obviously to the change from the
old system to the new.
The words: "To prevent the stoppage
of public business" simply mean that dur
ing the transition period from the old to
the new system of choosing clerks, depu
ties and employes, the heads of depart
ments or officers, "may, with the ap
proval of the commissioners," make
"temporary appointments'* until "regular
appointments" under the provisions of the
civil service act "can be made." This Is
the plain and obvious meaning and appli
cation of the language of the law Itself.
No "construction" is necessary.
Again, the language is: "To prevent
the stoppage of public business. OR TO
MEET EXTRAORDINARY EMER
GENCIES, the head of any department
or officer may, etc." The law not only
provides that the public business shall
not be PREVENTED or STOPPED when
the new charter goes Into effect, but It
further provides tho same method to
MEET ANY FUTURE EMERGENCY
that may ARISE. The Civil Service
Commissioners are not only clothed with
authority to PREVENT ANY STOP
PAGE of BUSINESS in the first yltce
when the charter goes Into effect but
also at any time thereafter TO MEET
any EXTRAORDINARY EMERGENCY
they may "authorize temporary appoint
ments."
Then again section 11 of the civil service
law provides as follows:
"All officers, courts, boards and neads
of departments vested in this chnrter
with the power to appoint deputies,
clerks, stenographers or employes in any
of the offices or departments of the city
and county mentioned in this section
shall make such appointments IN CON
FORMITY WITH THE RULES *Nl>
PROVISIONS PRESCRIBED BY THIS
.ARTICLE. AND ANY APPOINTMENT
NOT SO MADE SHALL BE VOID
Here the language Is equally plain nml
free from ambiguity. It requires that all
appointments shall be made "In con
formity with the rules and provisions pre
scribed by this article." What are "the
rules and provisions prescribed by this
article?" Is not section 10 above quoted
a part of "this article?" Under the pro
visions of section 10 all heads of depart
ments and officers may with the approval
of the Commissioners "make temporary
appointments â¢ â¢ â¢ until regular ap
pointments under the provisions of this
article can be made." If the heaÂ«ls of
departments and officers should assume
to make PERMANENT instead of TEM
PORARY appointments what would be
the consequence? Section 11 answers the
question, It says: "ANY APPOINT
MENTS NOT SO MADE SHALL BE
VOID."
Here. then, are two provisions of the
law. both entirely free from ambiguity,
setting forth as plainly as human lan
guage can spe.tk the intention of the law
makers that the provisions of the rivll
service law shall take effect and >â¢â¢â¢
tlve Instantly upon the charter itself tak
ing effect. Under such circumstance* I
decline to "elaborate a theory of coi
tion." I will leave the laborious, not to
say Impossible, task to Mr. Squires, sur
mising that he will have similar success
to that of the counsel f,,t the other mem
berÃ of "the push" who recently sought
before the Supreme c<mrt to negative the
plain provisions of section V_,. article
XI, of the constitution by "an elnbort re
theory of the construction." with the re
sult that a distinguished member of the
bench. Justice McFarland, disposed of it
by simply referring to the section itself
ns a sufficient answer to all the learned
arguments.
NOW, notwithstanding the forejjolnr
provisions to which I have called atten
tion. Mr. Squires makes the strnng â  pro
position that because the Civu
vice Commissioners first appointed will
have to "ciassifv" the places of employ
ment, make rules for examinations of
appllcan's nnd hold examinations under
them preliminary to the selection
plicants tor appointments, as req.ilrM
in sections 2. 3 and 4 of the act.

all the deputies, clerks and employes first
appointed will be exempt from examina
tion and may hold on to their place* la
spite of the civil service law.
lie reaches this conclusion by slmp!r
ignoring section 10 of the civil service
law, which I have Quoted, or which 'â¢
the same thing, saying that "It do*s not
apply." Let us Quote section ID arfalii.
It Is as follows:
"To prevent the stoppage of pablto
business or to meet extraordinary emer
gencies he head of any depai.ment or
office may. with the approval of the com
missioners, make temporary appoint
ments, to lemaln In force not exceeding
sixty days and only until regular ap
pointments under the provision of thU
article can be made."
Mr. Squires suggests that section 13 re
fers to the "classified" service provided
by the charter; that the Commissioners
are given authority over no other ser
vice than the "classified" service: that
the Commissioners can grant permission
to the heads of departments and ottlcer*
to appoint temporary clerks, deputies and
employes without examination only In
the "classified" service: and he argues
that, inasmuch as the service Is not and
cannot be "classified" on January &. I'jOO.
the first day the Commissioners take their
seats, therefore they will have no au
thority to grant their approval to the
bends of departments and officers to
make temporary appointments
From what source does Mr. Squire*)
learn that the Commissioners shall ha â¢Â»
no power or authority to grant their ap
proval to the making of temporary ap
pointments by the heads of department*
and officers until after they snail have
"classified" the service? Doe* section ii
say anything of the kind? Is anything of
the kind said In any other part of the
act? On the contrary, does the act not,
by its very terms, provide for the emer
gency which will surely arise at ilia
coming >nto being of the new city gowrn
ment; when no "classification" of tho
service will exist or can possibly exist;
when it will be necessary that some ar
rangement shall be made for temporary
appointments (pending classification and
examinations under the. civil service rule)
"to prevent the stoppage of the public
business.' It was for just this emer
gency that section 10 was incorporated
Into the civil service act. It provides ;n
terms for action before the "classifica
tion" can be accomplished, and provides
that the "temporary" appointments shnll
cease the \ery moment "renular" ap
pointments are made under the act.
â¢Mr. Squire* Innocently- asks. "How can
the commission grant permission in caso
of emergency to make temporary appoint
ments to any other than the classified
service?" To which i reply: They do so
by virtue of th- authority expressly con
ferred upon thÂ» m by section 10 of the act.
In which there Is nothing said about
"classification." The very object and pur
pose of section M was to provide fcr tho
emergency of there being no classification
and "to prevent the stoppage of publlo
business" by disregarding it until classi
fication and "regular " appointments
thereunder could be made. It would bÂ« a
waste of time and insult to our Intelli
gence to "elaborate" the point any fur
ther.
If the heads of departments or officer*
shall attempt to evade the civil service
law by refusing TO REMOVE the clerks,
deputies and employes whom they are re
quired to appoint temporarily on January
ft, 1900, at the expiration of sixty day* to
make way for the regular appointees un
der the civil service law they will bo
guilty of a flagrant violation of law, and
any officer who attempts to evade the
plain provisions of the law will not only
receive the merited opprobrium and con
tempt of every gooÂ«: citizen of this city
but will also be proceeded against accord-
Ing to law. Section 3) of the civil service
law gives full power to the Commissioners
to institute and prosecute legal proceed
ings .'or any violation of the provision of
the law.
The politicians and spoilsmen who may
succeed In getting "temporary" appoint
ments for "a period not exceeding sixty
days" after January S, 1900, will not by
that means secure any lien OB so-called
political Jobs. The civil service law doe*
not recognize them as political positions.
Those who may receive temporary ap
pointments will have no more right to re
main at the dose of their temporary ap
pointment than any one else. Jf they want
to keep their places they must take civil
service examinations precisely as other
people do that have no "pull."
Mr. Squires evidently questions the va
lidity of that part of the civil service law
which provides for non-removal of faith
ful appointees during good behavior.
When that question is raised It will be
time to meet It. Respectfully.

LADY DOCTORS TO CARE
FOR FEMALE PATIENTS
Through the Efforts of the California
Club Insane Women Are to Be
Properly Cared For.
The State executive has won the ap
proval of the ladies of the California Club,
of which Mrs. Lovell White i.- the efficient
president, by hearkening to their request
that a woman physician be appointed to
care for the female patients at the two
State insane asylums. In a communica
tion sent Mrs. Novell White, president of
the club, the chief executive notified her
that he had recommended that lady doc
tors be appointed and that his recom
mendation would undoubtedly be adopted
The members of the California Club are
therefore highly elated over the success
0! their efforts.
When the recent scandals at the State
asylums came to light they prepared a
circular and mailed it to the leading clubs
of tho State for approval. Fifty-seven
clubs, representing 17.000 of the leading
cltzens of the State, approved of ,i,*

GAGE GIVES TO RYAN AN
OFFICE AND A LAWSUIT
Appoints the Sacramentan to the
Doubtful Position of Public Works
Commissioner.
FRANK D. RYAN of Sacramento, Who Has Been Ap
pointed Commissioner of Public Works.
SACRAMENTO. Dec. 2. -The appoint
ment of Frank D. Ryan as Commis
sioner of Public w..rk> was an
nounced late this afternoon, and in
the opinion of many well-informed
persons Mr. Ryan occupies to-night
the rather paradoxical position oM^aving
an Important public office and Tit the
sarr..Â» time not having it.
It will be recalled that during the lat
â  ter part of the tern of Edward E. Leake.
.â â iit..r of the Woodland Democrat, his
was withheld by the state Con
tnent <>f the
eld office by
virtue of the act of .!ng the of
fice (which act, by the way, was sought
â  r whether both
acts had not expired by limitation. A de
cision from the Supreme Court was ab
talned. and being adv< rse to the claim of
, the Woodland editor, he gracefully wlth
; drew. Later a question arose as to the
| validity of the '. and an opinion
from the Attorn. -y General sustain- Â«l the
view that the ni'-asure signed by Gov
ernor Qaff* was not tho one actually
passed by the Legislature.
This was the status of the case to-day
when Prank 1Â»- Ryan was appointed Com
missioner of Public Works by the Q >T
ernor. The latter was not inclined to il
luminate the situation when questioned
this afternoon, remarking that he had
appointed Mr. Ryan ami that was all he
desired to say about the matter.
Mr Rj in was seen by The Call corre
spondent to-night, and he courteously
gave his views on the subject, saying that

Over 300 sifters, representatives of the
San Francisco convents And of thosÂ»>
buy. have for the past tWO
days been gathered together at tho B
Heart PrÂ» entation Convent. The object
which brought tli'in toÃether was the
sixth annual Catholic Teachers' Institute.
at which the convent Instructor! yearly
gather to compare notes and listen to
l. Tiiiies on their chosen life work.
ti . Institute this year, by the wide
abjects discussed, attracted an
even larger number than usual.
At I a. ni. on Friday the session was In
augurated by the celebration <>f holy
muss, followed at %'M by the president's
r U. Angeline of the Holy Name
nt) address of welcome to Rev. P.
Â«â  fforke. The address was in part as
follows:
Before we proceed to carry out the pro
gramme of to-day. In your name, l beg to ex
tend our heartfelt treetlng to the dear friend
who has come home to us from acro6Â» the
teas Welcome home, dear father; welcome to
the cause that lÂ» waiting its defender; to the
friends who have followed you with gladnvM
through your holiday, and with their only
wealth have .ought from God all the good
th For a 0 OU the old world has claimed you.
Its treasures of art. HÂ« shrines and Ha sanc
tuaries have wooed you by their beauty and
their ancient majesty, but If ether lands have
their masterpiece*, here dear father. Is the
life work tor which Providence has Â»haped you;
here is the came that Is dear to you. and here
are the hearts that are loyal and true to you.
Ac to St Patrick of old the voices of the lit
tle children would have cried out to you In
your dreams to return. And not only
the voices- of the little children. but
of all those who for years have been
wont to look to you for guidance
and for counsel, of all those who love truth
and honor and Justice. Others have gone
abroad and returned and made glad the little
circle they call friends, but when a whole peo
ple Join in one burst of glad welcome we must
look deeper even than friendship for the cause,
and find it In these words of the Psalmist.
'â¢Thou hast loved Justice and hated iniquity,
therefore God. even thy God. hath anointed
thee with the oil of gladness above thy fel
lows. 1 '
Father Yorke, after a few well-chosen
words of acknowledgment, spoke on
"Educational Ideals." The reverend gen
tleman told his audience of the desira
bility of a teacher's keeping a high Ideal
constantly In front of him. and of sparing
no pains to attain It. Ho then read the
annual report of the Christian doctrine
committee. This closed the morning ses
sion. . ..
At 1:30 p. m. the audience again gath
ered In the assembly hall to listen to the
Rev J A. McDonald's interesting talk on
"Our Present Position." The lecturer told
his hearers that the prime need was the
centralization of n high school where all
could unite In prosecuting the highest
ideals of education on a practical basis.
Rev Charles A. Kamm followed with an
earnest appeal for the development of
moral education In schools, which he
claimed was being somewhat neglected
In the modern scheme of education.
At 3:30 p. m. a recently returned 'Pales
tine pilgrim," Rev. P. J. Cummins, de
scribed his experiences in the Holy I.and.
Illustrating his discourse with over sixty
views of the country. This closed the first
day's session.
â¢'"The Fatigue of School Children" was
the subject with which Dr. Frederic
Burk of the San Francisco Suite Normal
School opened Saturday morning's ses
sion. An exposition of the different ways
in which fatigue affects the brains of
variously constituted scholars formed the
basis of an extremely interesting lecture
u was hls bellef l . nat the new act under
which he was appointed to-day was sound
ami then would v- no doubt as to his
title to the office. When asked about what
policy he jnt-ml.-.l to f-llow. Ryan re
marked that the work already performed
on tho Ban Joaquin and Sacramento liven
tiy -\-( ommlMloni r Leake was of a char
acter apjpt . nginecrs, and he in
tended to carry it forward to completion
and to continue the operations stopped
upon Leake'i n'r.-ment; he would pay
particular attention to 'the wingdams al
ready constructed and to the erection of
new ones, as well as to the N'ewtown J<H
tnd the cutoffs on the San Joaqulo
in.- purpose <>f which wai to make a
shorter line and better river channel from
Btockton t>> Ban Francisco.
The announcement of Mr. Rvan that he
Intends to perpetuate the Newtown ease
ment an-1 continue the work already done
toward the restoration of the Sacramento
River will be pleasing to the Sacramento
< h.imber of Commerce and to all the tax
payer! of the counties concerned in the
preservation of river navigation. Mr
Ryan is regarded m embodying the quali
ties of a Â«afe ami Intelligent officer and
the belief Ik general that the money re
â¢â K In the original appropriation of
:> will he well and carefully expended
under his direction.
Mr Ryan has held various positions of
public trust. He has represented Sacra
mento in the Assembly, has been chief
cl.rk of that House, has served three con
secutive terms as District Attorney of
Sacramento and is at present a trustee of
the State Library, a trustee of the
Chlco Normal School and a trustee of
Butter's Pdrt Mr Ryan Is prominent as
a Native Son. being a past grand presi
dent of the Grand Lodge of that order.
At 10 a. m. the sisters held a conference
In regard to the grading of schools, after
which Rev. H. WOOdS, 8. J.. of St. Ig
natius College, told the institute of the
various methods employed in the teaching
of history, particularly dwelling on the
methods in use in St. Ignatius College.
At 1:30 p. m. the afternoon session opened
with an address on "Correlation of His
tory With Geography." In which Mrs. C.
8. Place, principal of the San Jose Normal
School, explained the dependency of the
one subject on the other and dwelt on the
necessity for their conjunctive teaching.
J. W. McClymonds. Superintendent of
the Oakland schools, then spoke of "Num
ber Work in the Lower Grades." Father
Yorke followed with an illustrated lecture
on the "Development of the Roman
Forum." The speaker eulogized the ora
tors of ancient Home, who stirred up the
spirit of freedom among the Romans, and
stated that no scheme of education could
afford to neglect the Important subject of
oratory.
With the sisters' singing of the Bene
diction of the most blessed sacrament the
most Interesting and Important conven
tion of Catholic teachers yet held was
closed. The officers of the executive com
mittee were Â«a follows:
Bister M. Angelina of the Holy Name*

EXECUTRIX STORMBOUND.
Sheriff Directed to Bring Mrs. Miller
From Santa Rosa Island.
Even the element* are contributing to
the delay In the settlement of the ostara
of the late A. P. More. The matter of
the settlement of Mrs. Eliza M. Mt.ier's
annual account as administratrix was
not settled yesterday owing: to Mrs. Mil
ler's absence. In order to explain the
lady's non-appearance a letter from At
torney Storke of Los Angeles wai read
to Judge Coffey showing that she-wa* de
tained at Santa Rosa Island on account
of the norm and could not reach the
mainland for. some days. Attorneys
Evans. Peterson and Booth asked the
court for a citation directing the Sher
iff of Santa Barbara to go to the island
and convey Mrs. Miller to the court with
out delay. This action was finally or
dered and the Sheriff must brave tho
storm in obedience to the mandate of the
court. All of the attorneys expressed
a desire that the estate be distributed,
and an order to this effect will probably
be made on the arrival of Mrs. Miller.

DIRECTOR KEMP
STARTLES THE
GRAND JURORS
Admits His Part in a
Crooked Deal.
CRIMMINS* ORDER OBEYED
LIGHT ON TKE STATIONERY
SCANDAL.
In Its investigation of the scandals
which revolve around certain members of
the Board of Education the Grand Jury
received on Friday some startling Infor
mation, which tln> Inquisitors are guard
ing in the greatest secrecy. The star
â¢Rltm-ss of the day was Director William
A K<ni;>. who was, as usual, refreshingly
frank â even to the point of self-accusa
tion. ThÂ«Â« subject under discussion was
the chare**, published exclusively In The
Call Of September 10. that Directors Gedge
and Oonlon had divided C""' in bribe
money In-tween them and that Director
Keir.p. at the direction of Phil Crimmlns,
had remained away from the meeting of
the Supplies Committee when a crooked
contract for stationery was awarded.
At the meeting of the Grand Jury on
Friday Director Kemp wan shown the
ly.su*> of The Call of September 10 and was
asked if the Interview therein credited to
him was correct. The Jurors naturally
Â«-x]>cm-Â»l some hesitation on the part of
Kemp. !>m to their nirprlse he announced
that tht; interview was <-orrÂ«*ct in every
particular. In that Interview he declared
I;is almost unspeakable sorrow that J2O
pieces Khould l>Â«* Moating around when he
was away and he bemoaned the fact that
his friends miÂ»;ht look ujÂ»on him us a gen
tleman from the country.
He said that ho knew Phil â¢ rimtnin*
X'ery well and had remained nway.from
the meeting of the Committee on Supplies
at the hucgention nnd practical dictation
of Crimmlns.
"That interview." raid Kemp to the
grand Jurors, "is substantially correct. 1
rei:;;ihn d away from the meeting when
the stationery contract was awarded be
cause Orlmmins askrd me to do so."
The "jurors were dumfounded. Having
learned so much of the dark and devious
w:i\> <if the Hoard of Kducatlon, they
tvanu-d to lrarn more, and K<mn was
fairly j>^HÂ«d with questions. Then he be
pan to hcdÃÂ«. as developments promised
anything but comfort for himself. He

said, In answer to inquiries, that all he
knew of the twÂ«X>o bribery deal was that he
had heard that Directors Gedge and Con

his knowledge, he Mid, was hearsay from
the newspapers.
"And you rtally remained away from
the meetins of the Supplies Committee

TnE PAN FRANCISCO CALL., SUNDAY, DECEMBER 3, 1899.
OLYMPIC CLUB
IS BARRED TO
COLLEGE TEAMS
Ingratitude Displayed
by Managers.
NO FOOTBALL TICKETS SENT
MANY COURTESIES WERE NOT
ACKNOWLEDGED.
When the athletic teams of Stanford
and the University of California come
to this city In the future for baseball,
track and football contests they will find
the doors ol the Olympic Club closed to
them. Hitherto it has been the custom
of the Olympic Club to offer the 'col
lege athletic teams the use ol the club
house for dressing purposes whenever
they came to San Francisco.* No more
will the offer be made.
The reason for this is the treatment ac
corded the board of directors of the club
by the football managers of the two col
leges. All season both thÂ« Stanford and
California teams have come to the Olym
pic Club, dressed for the games and re
turned, using the club's bathing facilities
and all the privileges allowed the mem
bers of the institution. In the future
the colleges must look elsewhere for a
dressing i-nd. At least so say tin- di
rectors and ofllcers of the Olympic Club.
About *ix or seven days before the
Thanksgiving football match, thinking
that they wore overlooked by accident,
the Olympic Club officers sent letters to
Manager Alumina of the University of
California eleven and Manager Berry of
the Stanford team calling their attention
to the fact that no tickets to the big
game had been sent to the club. To the
letter addressed to Manager Mumma no
reply was received. Berry answered his
letter and both the absence of a reply
from the former tnd the answer of the
latter have stirred up a wrathful indig
nation among the club men.
Berry's r.ote stated that the compli
mentary list was already made out an!
that no more tickets would be distrib
uted. In the face of all the courtesies
that had been accorded them by the club
this came as a blow of ingratitude to the
Olympic olllcors and they are now going
to adopt retaliatory measures.
President Groer Harrison is among
those specially aggrieved and he will ad
vise radical measures, such as barring
the athletes of the universities from club
privileges. The tickets were not forth
coming when asked for and now no ex
cuse will be accepted by the injured par
ties. It has always been the custom of
the college manager* to allow the atth
letic club team, which played during the
season In the league games, a certain
number of complimentary tickets, but as
the Olympic eleven was in Portland on
the date of the big game these were not
even sent the club this year. What this
rupture in the friendly relations of the
colleges and the athletic club may result
in is not yet known. It may mean that
the Olympic Club will not place an
eleven In the field next year.
The excuse offered by .the collegians
for not sending the complimentarle* Is
that tire Olympic ttflm was pniti >1500 out
right to equip a football eleven for the
playing of weekly games with the uni
versities.

The Precita Valley Improvement Club
last night, at Graham's Hall. Alabama

YORKE TO CHAMPION
CAUSE OF IRELAND
WILL FEARLESSLY DISCUSS HER
PRESENT CONDITION.
The Popular Pastor of St. Peter's Will
Relate Some Varied Experi
ences of His Recent Trip.
"How is old Ireland and how does she
stand?" is a question that every new ar- i
rival from the old country is called upon !
to answer. Father Yorke will answer It
In his lecture at St. Peter's Church this <
evening. To many who are long absent '
from Ireland the situation there is but |
little known. To give publicity to Irish
news 1b not profitable to the telegraphic
agencies, hence their silence regarding
Irish happenings. For those, however,
who wish to bo informed of the real con
ditions existing at present In the . old ,
country a rare opportunity is In store this |
evening. Father Yorke has been In Ire
land recently and he intends to state Its
case Just as It appeared to him.
Ever since his first advent in San Fran
cisco Father Yorke has been known as a
fearless advocate of truth and Justice,
! and his statement of the case of Ireland
may be looked forward to with interest
as coming from one who Is not ashamed
of the land of his birth nor afraid to
speak the thought that Is in him.
Rarely does a visitor to Ireland receive
the attention accorded Father Yorke. His
was the privilege last summer of address
ing the Irish Bishops and the students of
Maynooth College, the largest ecclesias
tical Institution in the world. So original
and progressive were his views on educa
tion ana church government that Car
dinal Louge, who presided at the meeting,
thanked him warmly for his suggestions
and bespoke a brilliant future for him in
the American hierarchy. At many other
distinguished gatherings Father Yorke
was the honored guest during his stay in
Ireland.
His views as to the best method of bet
tering the condition of his native land
were pronounced and are ever since the
subject of much discussion. 1
In his lecture this evening Father Yorke
will carry his hearers back into the "old
land," and open to their view once again
the blue skies and fertile valleys that
many of them looked upon In the days of
their youth. The sale of tickets for the
lecture Is enormous and those who wish
! to secure seats should immediately take
i the necessary steps.
Fractured His Skull.
P. McColan, a laborer residing on Bran
nan street, was struck by a falling piece
of coal on the collier Miami last night
and sustained a laceration of the scalp
and a fracture of the skull. He w?s
treated at the Harbor Receiving Hospital
by Dr. Robinson and was later taken to
the City Hall. It is feared that he may
die.
MRS. C. T. MILLS
IS HONORED BY
MANY FRIENDS
Tendered a Brilliant
Reception.
ANNIVERSARY OF HER BIRTH
GLOWING TRIBUTES PAID TO
HER PERSONAL WORTH.
A brilliant reception was given last
night at Sherman & Clay's haJl by the
board of trustees, faculty and alumnae of
Mills Cullegu to its president, Mrs. C. T.
Mills, in honor of her birthday. The af
fair was strictly Informal in character
and was made the occasion for expressing
the high regard in which Mrs. Mill* is
held by those ladles who were at one time
under her charge, and also by men promi
nent in educational, commercial and pro
fessional ctr-W-s. At least suO gueilts were
present to wish Mrs. Mills a happy birth
day, and speeches were delivered by Dr.
Henry C. Minton, president of the board of
trustees of Mills College; Professor David
Starr Jordan, Professor Benjamin Ide
Wheeler, Rev. C. It. Brown and Horace
Davis.
The hall had been beautifully decorated
in yellow and white bunting and a pro
fusion of chrysanthemums and ferns, and
on the stage, which had been converted
into a bower of evergreens, were seated
the Mills College string orchestra, under
the direction or Professor Itocco Laraja.
and composed of the following young
ladles: First violin. Miss Millie C. Finley;
mandola. Miss Etna Miller; iirst mando
lins, Miss Lulu Bothin and Miss Clara
Mi Near; second mandolins. Miss Hazel
Kline and Miss Delia Zimmerman; gui
tars, Fraulein Wolf, Miss Louisa Wolf
and Miss Mat tie McCullough; pianist.
Miss Alice Connelly.
The orchestra rendered a number of se
lections, while Mrs. Mills took a position
under a beautiful floral piece in the center
of the hall and received the congratula
tions of her friends for an hour before the
speechmaking. Mrs. Mills was assisted in
receiving by Mr. and Mrs. Warren C. Ol
ney, Mrs. R. Barstow, Mrs. James Me-
Gauley, Miss J. S. Krink. Professor and
Mrs. Louis Llsser, Miss Garrettson, Miss
Everett, Mrs. C. Fritsch. Mrs. Wendell
Easton and Professor and Mrs. Keep.
Professor Jordan stood at the side of Mrs.
Mills and was introduced to the guests as
they advanced. Mrs. Mills was the recip
ient of a number of beautiful floral offer
ings, with accompanying good wishes.
At 9:30 o'clock the speakers of the even-
Ing gathered on the stage, where Dr. Min
ton began his introductory speech. He
stated that the occasion was a personal
one to testify the affection of those as
sembled for Mrs. Mills.
"When the educational history of the
State has been written." said Dr. Minton.
"there will be a generous chapter reserved
for the work of Mrs. Mills and her de
ceased husband. She has given fifty years
of her life to the educational interests
of California. Three thousand of onr
best young women have come within the
sphere of ncr noble Influence. Mills Col
lege la not a private- institution. It be
longs to the people of California. What
Wellesley and Smith Is to the East Mills
Is to the West. We value the gifts she
has given and look for the kindly help of
the other big universities in our midst."
During his speech Dr. Minton read a
telegram from Emma Nevada, in New
York City, as follows: "Tender love. Am
with you in spirit."
Professor Jordan was next Introduced
and paid a glowing tribute to the per
sonal worth of Mrs. Mills.
"It is not for me to say what Mrs. Mills
has done In the cause of education," said
Professor Jordan. "You know the his
tory of Mills College better than I do. In
Mills College I recognize the real de
scendant of Mount Holyoke College of
which splendid institution, founded by
Miss Mary Lyon.on the gifts of thou
1 sands of the common people of New Eng
land. Mr?. Mills herself is one of the early
graduates."
Profâ or Jordan then spoke of the ne
cessity of the higher education of women
a? well a* of men, and expressed his sat
isfaction that the broad course of study
in the institutions of to-day were open
to both. This higher education, he con
tinued, could be acquired in one of four
ways. The flm was In the establishment
of special colleges for women. Again in
annexes to colleges reserved for men. In
men's colleges, where women are toler
ated and In out and out co-education.
"I believe heartily In the latter
method." said Dr. Jordan, "but they are
all good ao long as they serve the pur
pose. There Is room on this coast for col
leges for women alone. We have two
universities where women are admitted,
but these are rapidly becoming over
crowded, and I would urgently recom
mend to our citizens the aiding of Mills
College, which has so many advantages,
and which if properly sustained will be
come better In many ways than Smith,
Holyoke or Vassar."
Professor Wheeler was received with
hearty applause, arid be also added his
meed of praise to what had alread
extended t<> Mrs. Mills. He recognised 111
the education of American VN.jin>-n the
remedy for materialism.
"In this country." said he. "we are as
suring ourselves a continuity of civiliza
tion in offering tbs brst advantai-
education to WOIâB. Any on* engaged
in the work Is blessing himself and his
country. Mrs. Mills hns been a blessing
to the StatÂ«* and nation for many years,
and I am fted to pay a tribute to hÂ«r de
votion and unselti<hnÂ»-.as in the ca
higher education for women. Would
there were more hearts like hors. warm
to the demands of education. I am al
ways ready to bow before any one who
gives herself as Mrs. Mills has done to
the public good. Godspeed to Milld Col
lege and Uod l>l>-ss Mrs. Mills "
Key. C. K. Brown and Horace Davis
also delivered eulogistic snÂ»'Â«..-heÂ« and re
peated applause greeted thÂ» lr effort*.
After the speeches the guests rÂ»- r
their good wishes expressed earlier in the
evening to Mrs. Mills, and many who
came latÂ«* likewise shook hands and ex
tended congratulations. Light refresh
ments were served and the evening came
to a pleasant dost

NATIONAL LEAGUE OF
REPUBLICAN CLUBS
PLANS FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL
CAMPAIGN OF 1000.
Colonel George Stone, President of
the League. Leave* for Wash
ington, D. C, To-Night.
Colonel George Stone, president of the
National League of Republican Clubs,
leaves the city for Washington, D. C . this
evening. He go**Â« to attend a meeting of
the executive committee of the league to
be held December 12, two days prior to
the meeting of the Republican National
Committee. Thirty-four members, repre
senting that number of States, have al
ready given notice of their Intention to at
tend the meeting.
Letters and telegraphic messages re
ceived recently by President Stono Indi
cate that the Republicans throughout the
country are confident of success In the
coming campaign. The national conven
tion of Republican clubs to be held under
the auspices of the league will assemble
next May. The time and place of the con
vention will be determined at the meeting
In Washington this month.
Republican leaders representing every
State and Territory of the United States
will be at the nation's capital about the
middle of thisvinonth. The Republican
National Committee will soon decide when
and where the convention of the party to
nominate President and Vice President
shall be held.
The convention of the Republican
league will no doubt be held at least
thirty days IWoro the nominating con
vention assembles. The cities of Cincin
nati. St. Paul. Chicago. Indianapolis ami
Galvcston are on the lint of available
meeting places. Colonel Stone Is not .â¢â !
vised of the preference of commttteemen.
but forms the Impression from letters and
telegrams that the contest for league con
vention honors will narrow down to Cin
cinnati and St. Paul. It Is probable that
Senator Hamilton of Ohio will be elected
president of the league, to succeed Colonel
stone. The latter is actively engaged In
carrying out rush contracts for the con
struction of the Santa Barbara extension
of the Southern Pacific Railroad.ADVERTISEMENTS.
A REASON FOR IT.
There Is Only One Pile Cure That Has i
Reached a National Popularity
and Reputation.
There are many popular medicines that
nre kn.'wn In every household In America,
There are blood purifiers, nerve tonics,
headache remedies, dyspepsia cures, and
cough cures, which are sold In every drug-
Moro in the nation and beyond.
Bat all of these must divide their popu-
larity with many rivals, no one remedy
lias thÂ«Â» field to ltsilf. with the single
exception of pile cures, for it is a singular
fact that there is but one pile cure that
can be considered aa having a national
reputation, without a rival and the re-
ferred to is the Pyramid Pile Cure, which
f<>r seven years has steadily worked Into
the public favor by reason of its ex-
traordinary merit, until it is known from
Maine to California and from Manitoba
to the pulf.
It is true there are many pile remedies
having v small local reputation for a year
t.r two. but the Pyramid Pile Cure has
rapidly supplanted them all and really
lias the field to itself when anything like
National popularity is considered.
Tlie explanation is simple. It is because
pflea is in no sense an imaginary trouble
that a bread pill or a simple salve or oint-
ment will cure, but an obstinate, painful
and 'fT.-n dangerous trouble and a remedy
to give satisfaction must possess positive
and very apparent merit. A person suf-
f.ring from piles will not experiment for
months with a remedy; it must give relief
and a cure In thort urder or it is con-
demned.
The worst cases of piles are relieved on
the first application of the Pyramid ami
n curÂ«j will result in a reasonable tlr.io
from its regular uÂ»c.
Medical men use it in preference to
operations because it is safer, is perfectly
Stainless :Â»nd the cost to patient is a
mere trllle. as all druggists sell the Pyra-
mid Pile Cure at 50 cms. und as It Is us.-J
at night It cures without interfering with
regular occupation.
If suffering from any form of plK's.
bleeding. Itching or protruding, a trial of
thÂ« Pyramid will cure you and add an-
other to its thousands of friends.

POINT RICHMOND IS TRANSFORMED.
\(/Â£'-iÂ£.KAL r/ew QfTHz nEw WfiAfij/z.
WHERE is Point FUchmond?
v \ >( fj Most people know that It is
\fy/ the l.ay end of the Valley
road, but not one In a thou
sand could tell you just where on the
eastern shore of the bay It is located.
The general idea is that It la a long
way .... fact is that It is only
seven miles from the ferry slip at the
foot of Market street, only two and a
half miles farther than the Oakland
mole, but nearly a mile nearer than
Tihuron. When you get to Point Rich
mond, San Francisco appears to be
only a few miles away, all of the
prominent buildings being plainly dis
tinguishable.
At present Point Richmond is a busy
place, for work on the big wharf now
being constructed for the Valley road
is being pushed with all possible speed.
Hundreds of men are employed and
the biggest plledrlver ever used in the
State hammers away lay and night.
To reach the Point at this time is
rather a long journey. The Southern
Pacific will take you to San Pablo and
from there a four-mile drive is neces
sary to reach the terminus of the Val
ley road. At San Pablo the Valley
road crosses the Southern Pacific on
a fine steel viadurt and crosses the
lr>vv lauds to the hills at the edge .if
the bay on a roadlx d built several feet
above high-water mark.
The hills on the bay shoe are
plrrced by a tunnel MR feet long,
through which the roadbed is laid.

The construction of this wharf com

was Blow, as the substance through
which they had to be driven was
stony. The shortest plies used were
thirty-six feet long, being driven eight
een .feet Into the bottom of the bay.
Those that are now being driven are
eighty feet long and those that will
be put in at the end of the wharf will
be 100, feet long. These piles are said
to be the largest that have ever been
driven in this part of the world, and

CHICAGO, Dec. 2.â Representatives of
the Rio Grande Western, Denver and Rio
Grande and Burlington and Rock Island
railroads have been in conference in this
city for several days, ostensibly to discuss
time card matters, but It iy>w appears the
meeting was called to consider much
gravor question;). Ottteials of these roads
declare they have learned particulars of
a secret compact entered into by the
Southern Pacific and Atchlson, Topeka
and Santa Fe railroads, and are convinced
their interests will suffer very severly tf
the allayed compact Is allowed to stand.
The people of California and the Pacitlc
Coast generally are Intensely interested in
this matter) as the effect of the combina-
I tion would be to nullify competition on
' the coast and rob them of the long-her
alded benefits to be received by the c-n
! trance of the Saute Ps into San Fran
! cisto.
It is charged by the officials of the rival
roads that the Southern Pacific agreed to
take off th.- "Sunset Limited, ' which for
merly ran over the Chicago and Alton,
Iron .Mountain and Texas and Pacific rail
roads, In order to give the Santa Fe a
clear Held in first-class travel to South
ern California. It was announced that
this train was temporarily abandoned be
cause of extensive Improvements being
made in the track of the Texas and Pa

St. Louis Jobbers'
Fight for Trade.
There will bo a general pilertrnage of
representatives of various lines >â¢! Pacific
Coast business to this city during the
second week of January. The hearing of
the suit brought by the St. Louis Jobb-rs
against the transcontinental railroads
will ..' resumed before the Interstate
Commerce Commissioners in this city on
Monday, nary 15. according to the
present understanding. That is the news
that Tralttc Manager H. D. Loveland of
the Pacific Coast Jobbers' and Main
facturers" Association has Just brougnt
back from the Ea.Â«t. When the heap
In St. Louis was suspended there was
some doubt whether the engagements of
Commissioner Knapp, who is to lecture
before students, would permit of the
hearing earlier than March.
TnUH Manager Lovpland returned
from the East I'riday night. Revlew'r.g
the proceedings in St. Louis in detail,
yesterday, he said that In saw no reason
for discouragement. In fact, he took a
decidedly cheerful view of the situation.
"The entire proceedings before the
Interstate Commerce Commission up to
dute," he said, "prove that we under
stood the position of the Middle WeSt
Jobbers correctly. Their suit is brousht !
ugaJnst the transcontinental railroads, j
hut the hearing developed the faot com
pletely that they have no complaint
against ;he road* on account of trars
portatlon rates. All that they really are
after 1b to secure the help ot the rail- i
roads to break into the Pacific Coast
territory and hand all the business over
to them. Of course, if they should suc
ceed in their suit, that would mean that
they would kill the business centers of
the Pacific Coast. Pending the re-sui^p
tlon of the hearing in this city the Middle
West jobbers art- doing all the mission
ary- work against us ... can
through the agency of their jobbers. A j
strong attempt is making here to get the
retailers to side in wtth the \li Idle
West. The result of that, if the retaiers
took that course, would be disastrous to
them in the long run. If the Middle West
Jobbers i-nuM got the whole business in
their har.ds they would squeeze the re
tailers whenever it became feasible."
Mr. Lovelund does not think that the
suit of the St. Louis Jobbers can be de
cided in many months. The Texas case
has. not been decided, although it was
heard six months ago. Aft the taking
of the testimony in his city the comnrs
sion will adjourn. Then the rebuttal tes
timony will probably be taken In Was.i
ington, where the arguments will he
heard. The St. Louis people intimated
that they would have one witness to be
heard In San Francisco. The proceed
ings here will probably occupy about ton
â¦lays. The work of preparing the testi
mony will new be pushed witTi great en
ergy. All linos of business will be repre
sented; all sections of the coast will send
representatives to testify.
The Pa rifle ('oast jobbers and manufac- !
turers are not concerned about the time
that may be consumed in the proceed
ings. Until the suit is decided thÂ» exist
ing conditions, which are acceptable to
thorn, will cr ntlnue. Mr. Loveland says
he thinks that the Pacific Coast will win i
the cane before the Interstate Commerce
("nmmissiorers on the testimoy. Very
likf-ly the Supreme Court of the United
States will finally decide. If the sun la !
decided against the St. Louis jobbers
they will certainly appeal to the Supror-e
â¢ '"iirt. Assuredly the Pacific Coast peo
ple will appeal if the decision is adverse ;
to them, i.pon the grounds previously
mentioned in The Call. Th.-re will t.e

ADOLESCENT LOVE OF A LOS ANGELES ELDER
Why the Scion of an Aristocratic Family Forsook His Happy Home.
NOW and then happens some
thing out of the ordinary in the
f player folk, and that
something recently occurred in
the Frawley company, now playing at
the California. What that something

his recent debut on the professional
prompted by no necessity of
earning his own living. On the con
trary he has such a plenitude of this
that he deems it proper
that some one should help him spend
them.
That some one dawned upon the un
eventful horizon of his existence some
months ago when Pearl Landers made
her first appearance with Frawley at
the beginning of his recent eight
engagement In Los Angeles.
A. Harvey attended the opening
night, saw the lovely Pearl and awoke
to the fact that his destiny was before
him.
There waf< the living, breathing, pal

fancy had created. Thfre waa the
flower that had blossomed from th.
seed of his imagination. He would
pluck it and wear it next his heart.

The success c* the Coney Island novel

children, and old and young never fall to

FERRIS HARTMAN IS ONCE MORE

Of very great musical Interest Is the
information that Mm<>. Gadskl, who was
so much admired whi.e appearing here
with the Melba company, has decided to
visit this city next March and Rive a
series of "U'aKnerian and operatic con
certs. She will he assisted by Walter
Damrosch. who will Rive some "Wagner
lectures, and Rispham, the famous bary
tone. It is also likely that Anton Schott
will assist In these concerts. Mme. Oads
ki has proven herself to be a vocalist of
much refinement and an artist of great
ability. She will be received with delight
by the many admirers whom she gained
during her stay here.

And so the grand opera season at the
Tlvoll Is at an end and with it the reign
of Qaudenslo Ralassa. That this was one
of the most satisfactory operatic seasons
Ran Francisco das ever had no one will
deny. Seventeen weeks of grand opera
and each week a great financial an well
as artistic raccaM speaks well indeed for
the ta.Me of our public. This season was
a sort of <'lv. EUlonal course which proved
very beneficial to those anxious to be-
COme acquainted with the Kl eater works.
During this seaaon San Francisco has re
ceived h better presentation of grand
opera than any American city outside of
New York and for a price of admission
within the reach of everybody. The music
lovers of this town ought to feel grateful
toward the Tlvoli for giving them such
excellent opportunities.
Yesterday I met Ferris Hnrtman. who
has returned from his Knstern engage
ment. Me Is looking better than ever and
Is "feeling fine." he says. He is very glad
to be back ie tin in Frisco among his old
friends and countless admirers and thinks
that he Is in Jus) as X ,.0.l (rim .is tie was
before he left, if nntn t better. While the
Tivoli is undergoing rejuvenation Ferris

for the purpose of greeting this success

The advance sale for the symphony
concert which will take place at the
Orand Opera-house next Thursday after
noon is surprisingly large. The demand
for seats was so that within a few
hours from the opening of the sale not
a choice seat was to be had. Henry
Holmes says he is very much pleased
with his orchestra and Is confident that
the musicians will do splendidly next
Thursday. The members of the orchestra
are delighted with Mr. Holmes" conduct
ing and think him fully capable of wield
ing the baton. Thus it seems that we are
at last to have some more excellent
symphony concerts.

With th* opening of the Frawley
season in this city the Elder was again
In evidence. Not as a spectator, how
ever, but as an actor himself. At
every performance where supernumer
aries are needed it Is customary for
Mr. Frawley to apply to one of the lo
cal dramatic schools to supply them.
He did so in this city and among the
bunch that was sent him was the Los
Angeles hero, who had followed the
troupe to this city and taken that
means to remain near the lady of his
affections.
Frawley. seeing; no harm In the
youths silent adoration, allows him to
go on at a dollar a night, appareled in
a dress suit and a state of ecstasy. He
has no speaking part, but as he looks
unutterable things it Is just as well
that he be not allowed to talk. He has
done so well, however, in the dance
scene that Mr. Frawley has it in mind
to Introduce him as a specialty la one
of the company's later pieces.
In the meantime Mrs. Landers keeps
a sharp eye oa her daughter, and an
irate father in Los Angeles is oiling a

â¦
ThÂ« muster rolls of the twelve com
plies of the First lU"giment of National
Guard have been pent to regimental
headquarters in accordance with orders
and in turn duplicates of these have been j
forwarded to division headquarters and
to lieaoquarters at Sarramcntn, en that
practically that organization Is once more
a part and parcel of the Second Hrigade,
as It was before the war. but numeri
cally not so strong.
Twelve officers of the field and staff re

the following numerical strength as per
muster rolls: A 12. li 55. C CB. D 32. E Â£2.
F 78. G Cl, H Cl. I C 2, X 51. L 50 and M 62.
These, with seven officers who had re- j
ported previous to the return of the First
California Volunteers, makes a total of
C!t\ Company D has prepared a supple- !
mental roll, which will swell its number;
to the minimum required by law before
a company can obtain allowance from the
State.
Â± This number will be Increased as soon
as arraj'.K* mints can be made as to the
baud. Then- is some difficulty in regard
to that portion of the organization as to
the number of men who are to bo en
liMed, but that muy be arranged in a few
days.
It Is expected that orders from supe
rior headquarters will bo received in a
few days officially declaring the existence
of The First itcgiment of Infantry. As
coon *Â» that siiail have been done re
quisitions for uniforms and equipments
will bo issued to the uniform board, hut
hn far as uniforms are concerned, it looks
as if that would bÂ«- a waste of time and
military energy, for the uniform board j
without requisitions has already secured
the uniforms; and it will simply have to
Â«i>-:.l ti,Â«m Â«>ut when they are dellvercdJ
The n. Xt thing In order will be the call
for the eluctlon of officers of the line, thai
Is captain*, and lirst and second lieuten
ants. Then It is. If statements are to be
relied ujton. that there will be fun in the

It \h possible that the Attorney General
may be asked t<Â» f'v hi.* opinion as to .

T was colonel of the First Regiment at the

mcnt. Vacancies In the substitute Hit
wire to be tilled from the unasslgned list
In the same manner.
After Mveral modifications the existing
Faluilrs for substitutes were, established.
Each substitute receives a dollar for
every day she reports and 5. 50 for every
day she works. Teachers on the ur.as
signed list receive pay only when they
work. The arrangement was eminently
fair and received the approval of those
Inn-rested In school reforms. It worked
well for a while and then the â¢ . Mit ra
began to plot. They saw an opportunity
to elect some of their friends to the de
partment.
One of the strongest rules adopted by
th.; board Is that which compels a
toach^r. after she hai left the substitute
list and has l>eÂ»-n assigned to a class, to
serve a probation of uno year before she
can be elected a regular teacher. Dur
ing the year several vacancies have ac
curred in the regular corps. These va
cancies have not b*>en tilled, as the
schemers of the board were waiting to
capture their prize. Substitutes are tem
porarily serving the closses. but the regu
lar positions have been left in the air
for the play which Kemp attempted.
There are now eight of such positions
which should be filk>d not by substitutes,
but by probationary teachers under the
condition of a year's probation.
Whil^ the substitute list has thus be^n
reduced, none of the seven unassigiud
:eaÂ« h.Ts have been promoted. They have
been purposely kept back because tne
board has no power to appoint â  K-acher
to an unaselffned position in the depart
ment. Having thus carefully prepared
the ground, the schemers began thrlr ac
tual work for the raid. Directors Arm
strong. Cole. Conlon. fledge. Head. Kemp
and Bergerot btgan to explore. Fheae
worthy rm-mbers of the board constituted
the original solid seven who elected the
president. Then Head was turned 'lown
and out of the chairmanship of tho com
mittee on supplies and deserted the
clique. Hut events change conditions and
he is back in the fold.
It was seen that if sections 1Â«Â». IC<5. 167
and ICS could be amended by eliminating
the probationary condition of nn election
to a regular position in the department
the trick could be turned. Any substitute
or unassorted teacher could then be
elected to a regular position. The prin
ciple of priority of appointment could be
destroyed and the vacancies in the regu
lar department could be tilled as tne
directors Faw fit. This was th.- first ad
vantage. Those substitutes now serving
regular classes would be forced back to
the substitute list and others appointed
later to the department -would not only
take their pla^o*. but would be protected
by regular appointment.
This would pave the way for the second
part of the ecr.eme. By filling the vacan
cies in the regular corps and Juggling
with the substitute and unasslgned lists
it was estimated that fourteen teachers
could be elected to the department. The
seven members agreed to the arrange
ment. Then Director Kemp Introduced
the resolution that was to complete the
deal. To his horror lWgerot made his
sensational protest. Secretary tnpson,
who knew of the entire affair, nearly
dropped from his chair In astonishment.
I?t-rp<-rot was he last member of the
board from whom to expect such a stand.
Something might be feared from the
minority, but they had been lulled off
thÂ«4r guard by being told that the re
ni^sinn of the probationary condition
was only Just to the teachers, some of
whom had served months In steady serv
ice. But RerpÂ«>rot upset It all, and now
the School Board Is not a happy family.
under the Chenowith bill these two posi
tions can remain open Indefinitely, as it Is
not known wh^n either will return to this
city, as one is Military Governor of Ne
pros Island and the other has re-entered
the volunteer service after his regiment
was ordered home. As to the latter. Ma
jor Sime. it is claimed by some that he
comes under the ruling of the Attorney
General to the effect that an officer severs
his connection with the National Guard
on accepting a commission in the volun
teer service of the United States, because
at the time his â¢â¢..â¢â  was ordered
home it was practically in the National
Guard by virtue of the Chenowith act.
l>ut that when the major did not return
but continual in volunteer service under
another appointment he went out of the
punrd. Others are of the opinion that his
service in the volunteers la continuous,
and that he cannot be said to have quit
the guard. As to Brigadier General
Smith, then- Is considerable doubt. When
the regiment was ordered home he was
no longer one of it* officer?, but was brig
adUr of volunteers and he is still in the
service as a volunteer from the National
Guard of California; not havinK been re
lieved or ordered home. His commission
as colonel of the First Regiment of the.
Guard drtes not expire until 1301. Fill
friends claim that he cannot be declared
out of the puard. and that under the act
quoted ho will have 150 days in which to
return to his command after returning to
this city and being mustered out.
Major General Dickinson; Colonel Cluff,
assistant adjutant gmrral on the dvlsion
stnff; Colonel McCarthy, surgeon of the
division naff; Major Narboe, engineer offi
cer on the staff of Hrlgadler General Mul
ler, and the adjutant general of the State
visited the encampment site at Santa
Cruz last Friday. They decided that It
was Just the place on which the Nation
al Guard of the State can hold Its en
campments.
This visit has brought up the subject of
encampment for 1900. and there is talk of
trying t.i Induce the commander In chief
to call a division encampment so that all
the organizations of the guard may meet
at the same time. Those who favbr this
proposition are of the opinion that It
would be better to have such an encamp
ment Instead of having brigade or regi
mental encampments, because the major
ity of the men have had experience and It
Is better thai they should be instructed
.<Â«. a whole instead of separate bodies
Those organizations that were unable
to practice at skirmish by reason of the
stormy weather or Inability to secure a
proper ranpe have had the time in which
to do so extended until the. 31st of next
January.
On recommendation of the, commander
f.f the Naval Militia. Lieutenant Douglass
White has been ordered to report to Cnp
taln Hawley of the I'nlted States shin
Hartford to Join the cruise on that ves
sel. This was In response to an Invita
tion from the Navy Department. It Is r
handsome compliment to that branch of
California's National Guard. The lieu
tenant will take: careful observations dur
ing the cruise, and he hopes that what he
will learn will bÂ« of great value to the
militia.
Cecil C. Dennis, lieutenant of the First
Division of the Naval Militia, has, at his
own request, been placed on the retired
list. Donald M. Stewnrt has been elected
ensign of Â«he Third Division of the Naval
Militia, vice Mc.N'car. term expired The
iilvi*ional officer* of the militia are ex

a view to rating them in January' next
The examinations will close on the 10th

There will soon he an election for line
officers In the Seventh Regiment of In
fantry, and It Is reported that many of
the men of that organization also propose
to "get square" with line officers for their
conduct during the time that they were in
the volunteer service.
SAX FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 3, 1899.
COLORED TROOPS SAIL ON THE
WARREN FOR THE PHILIPPINES
THE transport Warren pot away
for Manila yesterday with two
battalions and the headquarters
and band of the Forty-ninth In
fant (colored). The men marched In
from the Presidio, arriving at the
transport wharf about noon. All the
belles of colored society were down to
see the soldiers away, and there was
not an officer but had at least two
ladies there to Id him good-by. Near
ly all the officers are colored, and as a
rule the men take kindly to the inno
vation. There were exceptions, how
ever, and one soldier went aboard un
der arrest for threatening his superior.
It happened as tho first battalion was
marching down the wharf. A second
lieutenant (colored) ordered the ranks
to close up. One of the men failed to
respond and the officer touched him
with his sword and told him to close
up. The soldier grasped his gun by
the barrel, and. turning on the officer,
said. "Touch me with your sword
again and I'll break every bone in
your body." lie was promptly placed
under arrest.
There was considerable delay in get
ting the men aboard the transport, and
during the delay the band played a
Cakewalk. Immediately every soldier
within hearing began to fidget; then

HS far as' possible the executive
// \\ committee of the California Wntcr
Jj and Forest Association perfected
its plan of action yesterday .if
the Palace Hotel. The. work lasted until
late in the night. William Thomas,
president of the association and of the
committee, presided. The other members
of the committee present were: George
H. Maxwell, Arthur R. Brlggs, T. C.
Frledlander. P. A. Buell of Stockton. Ma
jor Rice of Bakerefleld. J. Richard Freud.
W. H. Mills, Mr. Plllsbury of Tulare.
Surveyor General N. P. Chlpman, Philip

afcDoUe of the Whitney Power Com
pany. There were also present Elwood
Mead of the Irrigation Investigation of
trie Lnlted Mates Department or Agricul
ture ami J. B. Upplncott of the United
States Geological Survey.
Constitution and by-laws were adopted,
offlcen were provided for. the duties of
the committee were defined to be the ad
mlnistrtZiloii of affairs in accordance with
the policy of the advisory council of
seventy. The work of th.- association
was set forth in the wing:
The objects of the association are
to promote the conservation V the
waters of California by Intelligent
methods of preserving and adminis
tering our forests and the impounding
of Hood waters: also to devise the
most economical method by which
the waters of the State may be ap
plied to mining, agricultural and me
chanical uses, and to carry Into effect
the platform of the convention held In
San Francisco on November 14 and 15.
ISI'3.
On motion of Arthur R. liriggs the
chair was authorized to name commit
tees on finance, membership, legislation,
publication, campaign and transportation.
\V. H. Mills moved the appointment of
a committee on engineering, surveys and
records, to collate and compile all avail
able information from existing surveys
as to the topography of California and
to consider all questions relating to the
further prosecution of th- Government
purveys which may have a bearing on tho
objects of the association. This was
adopted.
The disposition of the first $10,000 to
hereafter come into the treasury took up
the attention of the committee for an
hour or more. George II Maxwell in
troduced a resolution pledging that sum.
when it could be raised, above the neces
sary exoenses of the association, to the
prosecution of the work now being car
ried on by fie Irrigation Investigation
and th" Geological Survey. Plllsbury op
posed the resolution. Thomas favored It
on the ground that If the committee on
finance could show the public what it was
Intended to do with the money it would
be easier to secure It. Several of the
committee ppoke.
Messrs. Lippincott and Mead explained
that tho amounts of money that the Gov
ernment devoted to the work they were
carrying on In California were small; also
that the policy of the departments at
Washington was to help localities that
helped themselves especially. It appeared
that the sum of $3000 only had been ex
pended In locating reservoir sites in this
State during the past- year under the
Geological Survey: also that the en
gineering departments of both of the
universities In this State had offered,
through their engineering departments,
to assist in the work pursued by Mr.
Mead, asking only pay for the actual ex
penses in the field, the universities pay-
Ing the salaries of the men representing
them.
Elwood Mead reported for the Irrigation
Investigation that the work planned out
by him in this State for the ensuing year
would cost $OSOO. The total appropriation
for the work of that sort In the entire
United States was only J35.000. One-sev
enth of the sum lie had planned to expend
in California. Bui the department, when
ever there was a large expenditure In any
one locality, always Inquired whyâ if we
could show thai then was great Interest
in the work in this State and that the
people were putting up their money that
would assist materially In getting future
Government aid. He understood that the
treasury of the association was empty,
but he was wlllintr to take the pledge that
what could be done by the association to
help would be done as satisfactory. Prob
ably what money could be raised for the
TWO TRANSPORTS
MAKE PORT AND
ONE GETS AWAY
Grant Makes a Record
Run From Manila.
Two transports arrived from and one
departed for Manila yesterday. - They
were the Grant, Tacoma and Warren.
The latter went out during: the afternoon
with two battalions of the Forty-ninth
Infantry, while the former brought home
a few discharged soldiers and sick men.
The Tacoma came In early. She brought
up two passengers only. The remains of
Captain Charles French, Thirty-sixth In
fantry, also come up on the vessel. Tr.e
transport docked at Steuart street during
the day and as soon as the Government
stores can be put ashore she will te re
turned to her owners.
The Grant got in about 10 a. m. She
left Manila on November 7 at 6 p. in.,
thus making the run In tne very 4 uick
time of twenty-four days sixteen hour*.
After passing the lS'Xh meridian she trai
for four days in a typhoon and lbs host
the ship could average was 254 knots â 
day, while before that the average h>id
been 311 knots. The Grant was Jlying
light and In consequence the wind ha>l a
great effect on her. In spite of the heavy
weather the transport comes into port in
such excellent shape that she cm. l be
sent out again to-morrow. Chief < >tl> -r
Crosky and Chief Steward Herbert have
their respective departments as clean as
a new pin and both were congratulated
by the transport OlÃceri on the exce;R-nt
showing made by the ship on her arrival
after a round trip lasting nearly three
months.
While the Grant was in Nagasaki the
transport Sherman was th*>re coaling and
expected to leave for San Framl- o
twelve hours after the Grant, faho has
â  not a passenger aboard and should reach
port to-day. The Glenogle arrived Just
I before the Grant sailed and the Aztt-c
i was hourly expected. Both these vessels

purpose Indicated would be known *o<Â»il
enough to avoid any harm If there should
be a failure to get what had been ex
pected.
Arthur R. Brlggs offered a substitute
resolution, which wax adopted. Th pro
vided that It should be one of the special
alms of the association to assist in every
reasonable way the prosecution of the
work now bring -led on by the Gov
ernment in the State as represented by
Mead and Lippincott and that the execu
tive committee should be authorized to
use any money In the treasury. in excess
of that necessary for current expenses.
for that purpose.
A rr.Holutlon that was referred to the
committee by the convention concerning
sheep on forest reserves and national
parks was adopted. This provided that
sheep should not enter Into national parks
or forest reserves at any season of the
year; also asking Congress to permit thÂ»
location of reservoir sites in national
parks where the location did not Interfere
with any permanent improvements al
ready made In such parks; also approving
the rules and regulations of the Secretary
of the Interior for the government of tho
forest reserves; finally, that all possible
means should be furnished to enforce the
rules and regulations by liberal appropria
tions, by an increased force of forest
rangers and by giving police power to the
forest rangers.
General Chipman spoke In opposition
and said that this prevented the crossing
Â°l i â¢â¢rnm.-nt reserves by sheep on
their way from one range to another. It
had been said that the convention had
acted in favor of the cattlemen as against
the sheep Industry, which was a large
one. The effect of the resolutions was tn
practically prohibit the carrying on of
the industry to a large extent.
Mr. I.lpplncott Introduced a resolution,
which was adopted, asking the- Govern
ment to make an appropriation for the
extension of the hydrographic work In
this State.
The resolutions referred to the com
mittee by â¢he convention concerning the
Jetties and easement In the San Joaquln
and Sacramento rivers, which was intro
â¢lured by Prison Director Devlin, went to
a special committee, consisting of Messrs.
Knell. Devlin and \V. 8. Green, to Inquire
and report. ,
JuÂ«t before, the afternoon recess a com
munication was read, which was signed
by U A Nare. representing the Fresno
anal and Irrigation Company, In which
he set forth that all the canal companies
taking water out of the Kings River had
met at Fresno and formed an association
for the purpose of mutual benefit and to
look Into the question of th* cost of a
storage reservoir on that river for an
extra supply of water during the low
water months, and also to control the
waters during flood time. Mr. Nares
wished the executive committee to Indorse

F. W. Dohrmann. M. H. de Younsr. Tim
othy Hopkins. Philip Lillenthal and E B
Pond. This committee will try to raise
money from banks, large owners of reaJ
estate and others well nhle to help thÂ«.
movement. Mr Thomas said that he
thought Mayor Phelan would rtv. Jinno
He also had heard that John W. Mackav
had â¢marked that he would help larger
If the work was In the hands of the State
University. When the sum of {.mono had
been suggested to Mr. Mackay he had not
flinched. Probably he would subscribe
liberally.

Chipman which was adopted, asking Con

boundaries of California and substitute a
system of selling the stumpage of such
lands.

It la needless to say that Foster &
Harkott's big colt Yollowtnil was the star
of the racing at Oakland yesterday. The
Saturday crowd early â¢ Â»ik a fancy to
him. and his easy victory cost the books
dearly. The best of those pitted against
him were Princess .' Lka, Anjou and Mid
lty. The track had dried out until it was
once more In fast condition, and Fred FoiÂ»-
U r toM his friends to spread II about
thick on the ten thousand dollar l*Â»auty.
A raft of coin cut the odds from even
money to 7 to 10. When the barrier was
released Eddie Jones had Yellcwtail away
in the lead, and it was only an exercise

In 1:10%; the last live furlongs being
stepped in 1:00 s *. Princess Zelka respond
ed gamely to liullman's urging, getting
the place handily from Anj<-.u.
Mi. Ferguson ha.l one of his "off" days,
ther* being a tedious delay at the post in
nearly every race, the longest being in the
second number, when thirty-five minutes
were consumed before a. start was accom
plished. First choices, met with many
vicissitudes during the day, but two being
able â¢.- land purses. Still, nearly all or
the winners wÂ«-re well backed, and the
majority of books quit "to the bad."

him i. front fore half the distance was
traversed, and at the stand downed Furia
thre* lengths. Draw Lass opened a C to
i favorite, but did not look lit. receding to
7 to 2. and finishing last. Jacl had his
odds backed down irom 20 to 8. He did
not possess the necessary spec-d, ending
among the tuil-enders.
The twelve starterb in the six furlong
dash following furnished a lively betting
proposition, with LoÂ»t Girl closing favor
ite over Lothian, lialista. and Hio Chico.
The Jast named was touted as "the
goods." and when the field was finally
dispatched showed In front. Sink's geld
ing led to within a few yards of the wire,
wh're he was collared and beaten out by
Lothian, ridden by Henry. The favorite
had no chance after the start. During
the maneuvers at the post llallsta threw
Vltlltoe In a mix-up with the barrier and
ran away. Randall's unruly performer
later finished fifth, after getting a very
weak ride.
Dr. HoweH'B horse, Dr. liernaya. looked
the most eligible of the starters in thÂ»
mile and a half run and was Installed an
even-money favorite. He led after pass
ing the stand the first time, winning, rid
den out, over a length before Meadow
thorpe. second choice in the ring. Billy
McCloskcy ran a fair third.
In the mile and a sixteenth handicap
Rosormonde had too strong a pull in the
weights. Allotted 100 pounds, she carried
Bullman and five pounds over, and lead-
Ing from start to finish downed the favor
ite. Rosliiante. two lengths in 1:17*4. Top
mast, with Conley in the saddle, took the
show from Satsuma.
Bulln also piloted Sly. winner of the
last evert. The mare's odds receded a
point in the betting, and in a nose finish
she gained the decision from Morlnga,
ridden by Thorpe. Vlttltoe, astride the
favorite. Peace, managed to got a poor
tÂ«fnd off and went the. White Pass route.
With more luck nhe could have won.
Sister Alice also came in for strong sup
port, but never displayed much speed.

SOLDIERS
BEAT THE
MIDDIES
West Point- Annapolis Foot
ball Game Witnessed by
Cabinet Members.
Bpadai Wspatch to The Call.
West Point 17. Annapolis 5.
PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 2.â The West
Point football team defeated Annapolis
on Franklin Held this afternoon in â  hard
fought battle 17 to 6. # The soldiers won
becamio they played th*e better football.
They were musters of the situation all
through the game, with the exception of
the last few moment* of the contest,
when the middies by a mighty effort man
aged to score by a touchdown.
It teemed as though every army and
navy officer of standing at Washington
was present. The President's Cabinet was
represented by Secretary of War Root
and Secretary of Ihe Navy Long. The
two Cabinet officers received a great ova
tion when they entered the (rounds. Sec
retary Root and his party occupied a box
on thefarmy'B Bide ot the Held, while Sec
retary Long watched the game from the
naval sufhu on the opposite side. Be
tween the halves Secretary .Long was es
corted acro.ss the Held and congratulated
Secretary Root on the good worn done by
"his boys." This little incident started a
great hurrah. In which the yells of the
West Polni and Annapolis cadets were
mingled with the lons, loud roar of the
Pennsylvania students, who were massed
on the west stand.
Over 17,000 persons saw the contest.
The jinny wai well represented. There
were major generals, colonels, lieutenant
colonels, majors, captains, lieutenants
and privates scattered all through the
crowd. Among- those present were As-
Blatant Secretary of the Navy Allen, Rear
Admirals O'Nell. McNair and Rodgers,
Captain Robley D. Evans, Colonel K. L.
Denny of the marine corps. Governor
Voorhees of Now Jersey and Major Ash
bridge of this city.
Early In the game the soldiers got the
ball on downs on their 43-yard line. Line
plunges and two spins around the ends
brought the ball to the middles' 10-yard
mark. Then the West Point halfbacks
were sent against the Annapolis line
steadily until the ball was only live yards
from a touchdown. On the next play
Fullback Johnson was pushed over the
line for the first touchdown. Bettlson
kicked goal. or.-. West Point 6, Annap
olis 0.
- There was no further scoring in tho
first half.
Early in the second half a kick by Wade
carried the ball to the army's 10-yard
line, but Wesson tan the ball back ten
yards by pretty dodging. Another ex
change of punts and the ball was on the
army s 20-yard line. Without losing the
ball once the soldiers pushed the sailors
back from the army's 20-yard line to the
middle of the Bald and from there right
Over the Annapolis goal line. After al
most every scrimmage a- sailor would be
laid out. Rockwell, who took Clark's
place, made the touchdown and Bettlson
kicked the goal. Score. West Point 12,
Annapolis 0.
The army started her llne-bucklng work
strain, and did just* as she had done â  few
moments previously, carrying the ball
from mldtlold to and over the navy's goal
line Without losing it or being stopped In
her progress. Rockwell also made this
touchdown, but Bettlson failed to kick
a difficult goal. Scoie. West Point 17,
Annapolis 0.
When the play was resumed the ball
was carried to th*Â» army's 16-yard line by
a fine kick, which resulted In a touch
back for the middles and an exchange of
punts. Then the navy carried the pig-.
skin to the 10-yard line, where It was lost
to the army on downs, but was
Immediately regained on off-side play.
On four scrimmages the sailors
took the ball to the army's two
yard line mark and on the next line-up
Wnde was sent over the line for the mid
dles' first touchdown. The goal was a
difficult one and Wortman failed to
make it.
The game ended a few minutes later
with the ball in Annapolis* possession on
it own 43-yard line.

SHE LOVED
HER FORMER
SON-IN-LAW
Now Mrs. Meincrt Says if
She Had a Gun She
Would Shoot Him.
Oak ; a- I O~ce San Francisco Call.
SOS Broadway, Dec 2.
â Where as unsuspecting- mother Is util
ized a* a steppir.g-stone to the heart and
aSectlons of her daughter by a love
sick swain trouble Is sure to follow.
A case In point developed to-day at th<?
second trial of Jacob C. Sehinld. charged
with having assaulted the parents of his
former wife with a revolver recently at
their home near Frultvale.
According to the testimony the accused
Jacob carrrf a daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. J. M. F. Meir.ert some years ag:>.
but for reasons that were never made
known to the public the couple did not
live together In happiness. Gossips said
there waa too much mother-tn-law. Soon
the couple separated and the wife secured
a di%"orce. Jacob, however, persisted In
renewing his suit for his ex-wife"s heart
and hand and won her over again: they
were remarried and for a time appeared
contented and at peace with the world.
But the old trouble was renewed and for
a second ume Mrs. Schmid sutsl for and
obtained a legal separation. Jacob, one
evening about a month ago,, called at the
Melnert residence to visit his ex-wife.
He was ordered off the premises by his
irate ex-father-in-law, reinforced by
Mrs. Meir.ert. In an altercation that fof
lowed Jacob is alleged to have whipped
out a dangerous looking pistol and
threatened to shoot off the to? of his
ex-rr.other-in-laWs h*ad. The strong arm
of the law. with Deputy Sheriff Qulnlan
as the motor, was called Into service, and
the chagrined, twice-married and doubly
divorced Jacob was bundled off to the
County Jail, charged with assault with a
deadly weapon. About a week ago a Jury
trlM him. but disagreed.
During the past two days the retrial has
bÂ«*en on before a new Jury In Judge Hall's
court, and Jacob, it appears, came for
tlf.ed with newly discovered evidence. On
the witness-stand to-day In his own be
half Jacob testiried that the trouble be
tween himself and his wife had beÂ»Â».i
brought en by his ex-mother-ln-latr. He
declared that before he married the
daughter he had made love to the mother
and that she had made love to him to the
extent of placing herself In a most com
promising position. "When I forsook the
mother." continued Jacob, "for th~
daughter It produced 111-feeling and
finally resulted in the separation of mv
se!f and wife."

"REV." J. H. W. HARRIS.
THEOLOGICAL SEMINARY
TO MOVE TO BERKELEY
The Divinity School of the Congrs-
gational Church Will Have
Large Buildings Near
the University.
BERKELEY. Dec. â The first active
stAp looking toward the removal of the
Pacific Theological Seminary from its
present site in Oakland to one in the uni
versity town has been taken in the secur
ing of a lot on which the future Binary
buildings are to be erected.
The new location is on the Hilleguss
tract. It consists of a large lot 26S feet
lone and IS4 feet deep, with the frontage
or. Bancroft way, ar.d lying between Bow
ditch and Barrow streets. Thus situated.
It will not only be in the central part of
the town but its close proximity to the
buildings of the State University prom
ises to brine it into close contact with the
secular instruction of the big institution.
The choice of site on the part of the trus
tees of the seminary probably anticipates
the erection of the magnificent buildings
which Architect Em;le Benard of Paris
has planned. When completed the en
larged university grounds will border on
those of the seminary, rendering it almost
an Integral part of the large system oC
collece buildings.
But few of the actual detail? of the
erection of the structures have yet been
decided upon. It is known that the trus
tees intend to have a building three stories
high. It has further been settled that the
material to be used In construction will
be the same as that employed for the
frrry depot in San Francisco. The work
of building, however, will not be begun
till the latter part of next year.
HEALTH BOARD OBJECTS
TO LAKE CHABOT WATER
Company Asked to Continue the Sup
ply From. Fitchburg.
ALAMEDA, Dec. 2.â At the meeting cf
the Board of Health held last evening it
was decided to ask the City Trustees to
request the Contra Costa Water Company
to continue to supply Alameda with water
from the Fltchburg plant after It assumes
control of the artesian water works. The
matter was brought up by Dr. Lubbock,
who spoke of the superiority of the Ala
meda water over that of Lake Chabot.
which he said was decidedly less pure.
The doctor further stated that even If the
Lake Chabot water was not less pure the
changing back and forth from artesian to
Lake Chabot water would be likely to
cause much illness. The Health Oacer
was instructed to make weekly analyse*
of the water supplied to Alameda and
report the results at the monthly meet-
Ings of the board.
An ordinance has been drafted forbid
ding the sale of opium, morphine and
their salts, cocaine and the bromides ex
cept upon a physician's prescription. Af
ter a few minor changes by the com
mittee It will be recommended to the City
Trustees for passage.
Health OfScer ham reported that
there had been fourteen deaths during th*

births were reported for November, as

A RING ON A BELLE
and
A BELLE ON A RING
Ser. Fra:
90s Broadtcay. Dec. 2.
A ring and a bÂ«lle and a :>â¢;'-Â»
with a ring have caused all kinila
of trouble and several ratta In
the Oakland courts.
The suit that caused the orig
inal trouble was brought In San
Francisco by R. D. Duke against
John A. Beckwith of Oakland to
secure the possession of a COO
diamond ring. Beckwith, b*ing a
resident of Oakland, had the nxit
transferred to this county and
the story came out.
The ring originally belonged tc
Mrs. Charles Reynolds, the wife
of a clerk of on* of the Santa
Clara County Superior courts The
ring was Intrusted to Mr. Rey
nolds one day, which was an evil
day for the (tag. for It fell into
the hands of a young woman, now
Mrs. Mann. Mrs. Reynolds want
ed to know what became of nÂ«-r
ring and discovered Its loss. Be
fore she was able to trace the rtnsr
It had passed Into the hands of
John A. Beckwlth of this dry,
who loaned $2C*) on it. Then Mrs.
Reynolds assigned her claim la R.
D. Duke and Duke sued Beckwltlx
for the ring.
"All I know about this suit."
said B*ckwith to-day, "is that I
took the ring out of pawn for the
lady in question. I did not want
her to losÂ« the ring for the
amount that had been loaned on
it And I gave COO to get it out of
pawn for her. The ring wai
pawned for JIOO. I gave that
amount and 1100 more. This is &
business transaction and the suit
cannot lie.
"Th- only way In which they
could make a suit stick against
me is to say that the ring wa*
given to me by the girl after its
having been given to her by Rey
nolds. When I originally put up
the money for the ring I knew
nothing about its early history.
It vis not until a few months
ago that I learned the full story
that Km Reynolds claimed that
the ring had been given away by
her husband. That has nothing
to do with me or my claim to the
ring ar.d I do not propose to re
linquish that claim."
The belle is still after the ring.
Married at Hay-wards.
HAYWARD& Dec. :.-Th^re was a.
quiet wedding here a few days ago. at
which Miss Elr.ora Culp became the bride
of James H. Gray. In fact it was so
quiet that half the town was not aware
that the ceremony had taken place until
a day or so later, although the young
p-?ople ha.i been engaged for a long time.
A relative of the bride died only a <Â»hort
time before, and although elaborate prep
arations bad bÂ«tn made for a general
â¢weddin? reception the sorrow in the
family made necessary a change in the
plans. This was why the young folks
went quietly to the Hay wards Congrega
tional church or. Wednesday evening and
were made husband and wife in the Dres
â¢nce only of immediate relatives. On thÂ»
following day Mr. and Mrs. Gray de
parted for the southern part of the State
to spend their honeymoon. Upon th-ir
return they will reside here, where Mr.
Gray has several business Interests. The
bride is well known In Oakland and Ala

BISHOP NICHOLS
DISOWNS "REV."
J. H. W. HARRIS
Investigation From
Far New York.
â¦
MAN OF MANY ATTAINMENTS
â â¢
LAY READER. EVANGELIST. AC
TOR, NEWSPAPER 31AN, ETC.
a - Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
SOS Broadway. Dec. 2.
An Investigation has bÂ«t*n started from
Stew York ad to the "Rev." J. H. W. Har
ris, formerly of this city, and this investi
gation has called forth some criticism of
this remarkable gentleman. It would
seem from dome correspondence that has
passed lately between New York, hi*
present home, and Oakland, his former
home, that the claims of the "Rev." J.
H. W. Harris to an interest in the Protes
tant Episcopal church were disputed by
the high officials of that denomination.
Harris is now In New York and has
been attending the famous John-street
prayer meetings in the little old John
strtet Church, one of the most famous
churches in the great city. He has been
taking a very active part in the proceed
ings of this noonday business men's
prayer meeting and has been trying to
obtain some active part in the evangelistic
work there conducted. 111 Hams did
not wholly impress the participants la
this active work, and one of the leaders,
E. D. 6n;:T*n. wrote to Oakland asking
that Bishop Nichols of . the Episcopal
church be seen. â¢'-'â  "
"Concerning Rev. James H. W. Harris.
who claims to have been a minister ot a
parish between Oakland and Golden Gate,
he is here, a non-sectarian, without en
gagement, wears priestly clothes, a big
silver cross on his watch ribbon ana
states that he left the Episcopalian
church, having become disgusted with
sectarianism."
This request brought forth an answer
from Bishop Nichols in which he says
with regard to Harris:
"Harris has for years posed as an ex
clergyman of our church, and time and
again public announcement has been mad
of the faUity of the claim. For a short
time hÂ«s was a lay reader, but the license
had tv be withdrawn. He was never ad
mitted to any sisp toward the ministry.
After having his license withdrawn h
! became successively an independent evan
gelist, business man. actor, etc., and hÂ»
managed to keep himself before the pub
lic. 1 '
Harris has had a most varied career.
and. as Bishop Nichols says, has manage 1
to keep before the public gaze. He began
as a lay reader in - little church that re
had built near Emeryville. He tried to
gather a part.*.- around him. but did not
succeed, and he had the rather remark
able experience of having his church
building sold under foreclosure for thÂ»
; lumber in it. Then he started a mission
in a tent at the corner of Seventh and
Market streets. In this city, and those who
remember him will recognize Mr Sniflen's
description of the priestly clothes and the
big sliver cross. He always affected the
most ultra-priestly attire, though not aa
ordained minister of any denomination.
Then Mr. Harris drifted out of Oakland
and tried San Francisco as an evansellst.
but failed. Then he went on the road aj
an actor In a heavy melodrama, which
went on the rocks in an interior city.
After that Mr. Harris tried the bound
ing East and plunged Into New York,
with what result Mr Bntffea shows. Since
his ..-rival in that city he has been an
actor and an evangelist, and then wrote
his experiences or the New York papers,
tirst as an actor In the pulpit and then as
a minister on the stage. Now the John
street prayer meeting is looking up his
record, and this is the strange history
j that they f.nd.

EUREKA. Dec. 2.-All that remains of
t^e steamer Wpeott. which was wr-*cked
last night on the south Jetty at the en
trance of Hurnboldt bar. Is a muss of
, wreckage scattered alon? the
bench for miles. During the night the
1 vessel pounded herself to pieces until The
last vestige had followed Its fellow to the
beach on the flood tide.
The steamer had laid outside all day,
and as the bar appeared smoother and as
night drew near. Captain Burtls deter
l mtn*d to cross In. Perhaps half the dis
j tance had bt-en covered when heavy seas
swept over the fated vessel, smashing her
after housing and breaking one of the
big steam pipes. Helplessly the ship 1c-
I gun to drift toward the rocks of the
jetty, and a short time afterward struik
heavily at a point about half a mile in
side the bar, but at a point where the
t-'-n wh!Â» In a fearful turmoil.
At this ;lni.Â» the splendid heroism of
Second Officer Charles Renler was dis
played. It was apparent that the vessel
could not last lung In such a sea and
Itenier volunteered to attempt to swim to
the trestle with a lifeline. Dotting most
of his clothes and strapping a life-pre
server about his body, tha brave man
Jumped overboard and began a desperate
nand-to-hand battle with the angry
waves. Through boiling waters he made
his way, most of the time under water,
to attempt a landing on the sharp and
partly covered rocks which were sur
mounted by the trestle used while the
breakwater was in course of construc
tion.
Bleeding from contact with the sharp
rocks, he finally caught hold of one of
the barnacle-covered piles, and with his
remaining strength managed to climb to
the top and establish practical communi
cation with places of comparative safety.
To this man most of those aboard owe
their lives, for the life-saving vn-w used
the communication thus established In
rescuing the passengers and crew.
Captain Burtls, Chief Engineer H. K.
Bodner and First < >ili. . r Eusha Morgan
also did valiant and able service during
the work of rescue. It was while seeking;
for Fireman guinn. whose leg was
broken and whom he afterward succeed
ed in saving, thai Captain Burtis stum
bled down a coal hatch and was severely
injured. He was the last man to leave
the Up, and In leaving was obliged to
cut himself loose and be hauled to the
trestle through the seething waters. The
chief engineer, while seeking and assist
ing passengers, discovered Mrs. William
Staples pinned down amid the wreckage
of the demolished housing, and refused to
abandon her to her fate, although the
vessel was at the timÂ»Â« threatening to go
to pieces. The unfortunate lady was
finally extricated from her perilous posi
tion and conveyed by â  sling to the
trestle. She was badly Injured, however,
her spine being fractured, and after being
removed to the life-saving station it waj
discovered that the whole lower part of
her body was paralysed, it Is doubtful* if
she will survive her Injuries.
The body of one victim. Mrs. Car
mlchael. floated Into the bay this morning
and was picked up by a couple of young
men. A life-preserver had prevented it
from sinking and It had come In on the
Hood tide. Th" body of Carpenter Wilson
has not been recovered. Injured Fireman
Quinn is expected to recover.
WERE FIREMEN WHEN
THE CITY WAS YOUNG
ANNIVERSARY OF ORGANIZING
A PAID DEPARTMENT.
Veterans Gather at a Banquet and
Tell of Times When They Ran
With the "Old Masheen."
Thirty-throe years apo last night the
Ban Francisco paid lire department was
onranized and a few weeks later the old
volunteer brigade that figured so promi
nently in the history of pioneer days went
out of existence. The event was cele
brated by the second annual banquet of
the Veteran Firemen's Association held
at a well-known rotisserie, at which near
ly one hundred vets taxed the waiters'
patience and retold anecdotes of old
, times.
The banquet was declared at the begin
ning, by President Kennard, to be devoid
<>: all cold formality and his idea was car
ried out. even to the dispersing of the
' merry crowd some time this morning to
i the music of "A Hot Time." For two
hours the veterans and a few who were
not vet* struggled manfully with the
menu, which by a freak of fate was
printed in French. Director Truman .x
plained that the Parisian flavor to th.
souvenir card was nut his specialty, but
his expression of confidence that no mat
ter how the courses were named the- vet
erans would acquit themselves valiantly
', In attackii., â¢ proved to be well grouri'leu.
Crevette, pommo Duchesse, canard, chou>
i fleur au gratin, dlndc farcis and fromage
proved to be as acceptable to the white
headed men who, a generation ago
1 grasped a rope and ran with the old ma
chine, as If they were Just plain duck, po
â  tato, turkey and cheese.
Whenever interest lagged for an in
stant some one suggested that "another
; hose be- unrolled," and If the waiters in
their desire to be diligent cheated Uncle
Sam out of a few war stamps It was not
their fault.
Several of the vets made short speeches,
and led by the band songs were frequent.
The officers of the association who ar
ranged the banquet are: Chief George W
Kennard. president; Captain Richard Cox
Brat vice president: Thomas R. Carew

secretary; J. B. Barber, financial secre
tary; Fred C. Hensley. treasurer: Captain

GARDEN OF ROSES.

It 1Â» true that the flowers are painted
but the artist. Paul de Longpre. has given

can hardly believe that the blossoms are

Paul o> I^ongpre has pained world-wide
celebrity as a flower painter. One must
nee what he can do in order to comure

of California. I have never been In that
wonderful country, but every one tells me
that I will be delighted and that 1 will
find flowers that have not been painted
by any artists. I .shall study the flowtrs
paint them and exhibit them."
The artist came to California and found
that the half had not been tr>ld regarding
the floral wealth of this land. The pru
pect so delighted him that he "settled

SAMOAN TREATY
NOW IN EFFECT
Signatures Affixed to

CALL, HEADQUARTERS, WELLING- :
TON HOTEL. WASHINGTON. Dec. 2.-
Secretary Hay, Lord Pauncefote and Herr
yon Holleben. on behalf of their re-
Hpectlve governments, to-day Flgned the
treaty for the partition of Samoa. The
ceremony took place In the diplomatic
room of the State Department, There
was no preliminary discussion, as tho
three officials agreed on Wednesday last
to the text of the convention and a com
parlHon was made at the department yes
terday of the German and English texts.
The treaty was signed In triplicate. Sec
retary Hay affixing his signature first to
the American copy, the German Embas
sador being followed by Lord fauncefote.
The German Embassador signed the
German copy first, the British Embassa
dor and Secretary Hay signing In the
| order named, and ilnally the British copy
| was signed. Lord Pauncefote first atlU
lng his signature and German and Ameri
can representatives following htm.
The treaty will be submitted to the Sen
ate after the President submits his an
nual message. In which will be incorpo
rated a paragraph referring In congratu
latory terms to the conclusion of the con
dominium and the advantages which the
I nlted States has obtained by the parti
tion of the Saniuan group.
As has been repeatedly stated, the
treaty provides: Firstâ all treaties
in existence between the signatory pow
ers relative to the Samoan Islands are ab
rogated. Secondâ That Great Britain and
Germany cede to the United States all
their rights and claims to the Islands
east of the one hundred and seventy-first
degree of longitude, Including Tutulki and
subsidiary islands; and Great Britain, and
the United States cede to Germany all
their rights and claims to the islands
west of the one hundred and seventy-flrst
degree of longitudeâ Savall and Upolu.
Finally, the signatory powers should con
tinue to enjoy for commercial purposes
all privileges possessed by the sovereign
power in the ports opened to them. ,
From what I was able to learn to-day
the signing of the treaty Is the end to
ward which the administration has been
working for a yearâ since the dis- i
pute arose as to the successor of Malletoa
as King of Samoa. The President and
Secretary Hay have been anxious to
withdraw from an alliance so entangling
in character and filled with complications,
and consequently when the negotiations
for the partition of Samoa began in Sep- i
tember they were only too willing to con
sent to the abrogation of the Berlin
treaty, provided American lights were
fully protected. The administration be
lieves that ratification of the treaty will
be obtained, though it is expected that
the anti-imperialists will make a strong
fight against it. and especially in view of
the great advantages which this Govern
ment has obtained, particularly in the
matter of the acquisition of Pago Pago,
described by naval ollieers as the finest
harbor in the South Pacific.

CARRIED AWAY TOOLS
IN THE EARLY HOURS
Chief of Police Lees was notified last
night that a rang of thieves Invaded the
quarry of Warren & Malley, on tho San
Bruno road, and In the absence of tho
workmen carried away tools valued at
$100 and did damage to the extent of $200.
William E. Warren, a son of the senior
member of the firm, made the report of
the depredation and Detectives Ryan and
ODea were, immediately detailed to ap
prehend the guilty parties. According 'o
Mr Warren the robbers visited the quar
ry shortly after midnight Friday and af
ter forcing open the door of the house in
which the tools were stored, proceeded to
pick out the finest In the lot. In their
search for plunder they broke open a
number of small boxes and carried their
contents away. A large chest containing
dies and implements used In blasting was
found 300 feet from the storehouse de
spoiled of its contents. The robbery was
discovered early Saturday morning. It
was so complete- that a number of the
workmen were laid off until now tools
could be procured.
Suspicion has fallen on the Bay View
gang, which hangs around the neighbor
hood. The members of the rang are look
ed upon by the police as bad characters.
One of the ringleaders Is Frank Shea, a
nervy young man, who not long since dis
posed of a sack of sand to a grocer as
sugar. The Bay View gang Is familiar
with the doings at the quarry and it is
believed nome of Its members waited until
the place was deserted and then de
scended on It and completed their whole
sale robbery.
A watchman now guards the place and
thieves will receive a warm reception
should they attempt to rob It a second
time.

bill. The whole energy of the Emperor
and the Government will be used toward
making the bill a law and thus securing
for Germany the second place In the
world as a naval power. After surveying
the parliamentary field It seems probable
that the bill will pa*s, as the whole right,
part of the center and a portion of the
left seem to favor its passage. No doubt
German public opinion overwhelmingly
favors the bill, as the people believe with
the Emperor that It is absolutely neces
sary for Germany's continued prestige us
a world power and for the extension of
| German trade and influence abroad. Bo-
Bides, the conviction is now held gener
ally here that France need not be feared
as a serious competitor militarily, she
having reached her ultimate limit in in
creasing her army and being, unable to
: compete with Germany's additional 15.
; 000.000 of inhabitants. Thus It may bo
said that Germany now has her handts
free for naval expansion.
The Government's purpose to transform
Emden. hitherto a small North Sea har
bor, into a first-class naval port, has be
come plainer every day. On exceptional
authority it is learned that these plans
' embrace the deepening of the river bed so
as to allow the largest warships to enter
the port. The first installment of 9,300,O | 0
marks for these improvements will reach
I the Prussian Diet after its reconvening.
The Government will also erect big naval
Shipyards and dry docks at Emdcn. The
dry. locks will be pushed so that a number
'. of the vessels demand by the new ntival
bill may be built at Kind' n.
The desirability of the United States
â  having suitable permanent embassies
abroad is again unpleasantly illustrated
by the humiliating experience "of Km
bassador White as cabled to the Asso
ciated Press on Wednesday, and by tliÂ»>
fact just revealed that the Minister it
Vienna is undergoing a worse experience.
i Mr. White's trouble is likely to be tided
i over, as it is understood that the little
1 Government of Baden has offered to al-
I low the American Embassador to occupy
, the top flat of the building It purchased
! until the end of President McKinley's
j term. Since Mr. Harris arrived In Vienna
he has been vainly searching for a suit
able house. The difficulty Is the unwil
lingness of Austrian landlords to rent to
Americans.
Mr Harris' predecessor. Bartlett Tripp.
had a dispute with his landlord, and the
latter sued Mr. Tripp successfully. He
pleaded exterritoriality, but without ef
fect. Even the Vienna tradesmen are dis
inclined to supply any one connected with
! the legation unless paid in advance. Both
these incidents are causing much aston
ishment and talk in diplomatic circles at
Vienna and Berlin, and many disparaging
remarks have been made against the
United States' policy in this respect
Dr. yon Miquel. whose skill in financially
I squeezing the German subjects for the
benefit of the state is proverbial, has fall
. en a victim to his own tax gatherer*.
They have rejected Dr. yon Iflquera in
come tax return, declaring he omitted the
Income of the Bileslan estate, which Dr.
Miquel claims is unproductive. The con
troversy, which the courts probably will
have to decide, Involves only a small
amount, but the department Insists upon
Its alleged rights.
Mrs. William Walter Phelps has arrived
here. She and her daughter. Countess yon
Rottenberg. and Count yon Rottenberg
i will go to the Riviera for the winter.
Dr. yon Mumm Schwartzensteln. re
cently acting German Bmoassador at
! Washington, took luncheon with the, Em
peror to-day. The conversation turned
incidentally to American affairs an-. 1 the
surprising development of the United
States. Among the guests was Prir.co
Regent Albrecht of Brunswick, who told
about his recent mission to Spain. He
said the young King evinced considerable
i Intelligence, but that he was still kept
i from all state affairs and treated alto
gether as a child. .
Germany to-day renewed her prohibi
tion against the Importation of Rouma
( nian meat, issued in IMS, but Ions; !n
abeyance. _^^____^^^__
TEDDY HARTMAN IS
WITH US ONCE MORE
RETURNS TO FILL ENGAGEMENT
AT THE TIVOLI.

' Eastern vacation last night to fill

I come home, and as the last of the over
land passengeri were coming ashore and
no Teddy huve In Might a rumor soon
spread that he had given the boys the
J>lip and would remain In Oakland a while
In order to make a quiet entrance later
In the evening. Just as the gates were
about to dose some one In the Â« % rowd spot
ted the Jolly comedian and for the next
f<w mlnutefl there was nothing but hand
shaking and "Never felt better In my
llfÂ»'" In answer to the oft-asked question.
Hartman looked the picture 01 health
and ready money, ton. His latest "Lun

cream-colored Alpine hat with a light
a la Turk band, giivr him the *ppearnn<-e
of a well-to-do Englishman on a globe

"Yes. indeed." s.il-1 Hartman. "I am
glad to be once more Ir. old Frisco, the

Minnie Adams Wants New Trial.
Argument on a motion for a new trlnl
for Minnie Adams, convicted of the mur
der of her Infant son. John RlchnJ
Gray, was continued before JuogÂ« Lawlci
yesterday. The defense claims thnt ns
the Jury remained one night In the Or|.-1
Hotel ami was necestanlv divided
through the fact that no room in the
house contained twelve beds. It Is ground
for a new trial. They claim that a di
vision of the Jury Is not permissible un
der the law and that hence il-e defendant
should be granted a new trial.

to put the return to cheap money some time
In the future.
The bank of England has waited to itmw

The strength -ol last Saturday's bank state

Th^se operations disclosed a change from the
recent policy of calling In no mure of out
standing creJlts than necessary to keep barely
within or even slightly below the level reserve
requirement. Not content with an Increase In
cash resource* cf over eight millions, this ("In
gle Institution contracted Its loan? over four
mUlkns last week. This looks like entering
upon a system of recuperation In preparation
fÂ»r meeting a coming demand. Such a policy.
while strengthening the showing of thÂ» banks,
would still further restrict funds available fjr
speculative oreratiotys In stocks. The lnK>r::>r

manifested that this measure serves only as
a f.ifety valve and th\t It releases no funds
except uriiier pressure of high money rates.
Any considerable encroachment on money Â»up
ply fr-r purposes of stock speculation threatens
to precipitate a money stringency which would
In itself defeat the object of the speculation

Associated Banks' Statement.
NEW YORK. Dec. I.â The Ffnancler say*:
ThÂ« statement of the associated banks of New
York City for the week ending December 2
shows that the Institutions are finding ready
employment for the supplies of money they are
accumulating from the treasury, although a*
a matter of fact the averages are so dominated
by the chances reported by one large bank
that general deductions are somewhat difficult
to make. The National City Bank, which at
the close of the previous week reported all the
gains in cash, proving conclusively that the
other Institutions had not bettered their poal
tlcm from a roÂ»erve standpoint, appears In a
somewhat similar role In the current exhibit.
This bank, with the National Park Bank, ac
cumulated nearly all the excess cash that has
beÂ»a received, and the former has laade practi
cally all thÂ» new loans and gained half the de
poMt Increases. The Inference is that the po-
Eitten of the ether banks ha* changed only
sllKhtly for the better during the wrek. With
these fact* In mind the statement tuumei a
different meaning, but. taking the exhibit as a
whole, the totals are to be regarded as satis
factory* Ap&nfi'<n* in loans and In deposits
show that the contractloas which have charac
terized thes* Items with little Intermission since
July. last are perhaps at an end. The banks,
with thÂ» certainty of a source of replenishment.
: now that the treasury has extended th period
iof bond purchases, are apparently willing to
enlarge their commitment, and a* the pressing
demand from the interior Is at an end It Is only
reasonable to expect that the totals will show
Increases over the new year. In view of th.?
fact that the country is doing a much larger
volume cf burlnesa and is using much more
monÂ»y than was the case last year. II Is not
expected that the banks here will be able, even
If willing, to encourage such a rise In loans as
occurred from January well into the spring of
this year. The surplus reserve of the banks Is
now 531 700, which Is only about half that
reported for the opening week In December.
IR$Â«. while loans are {15.000.000 lower. The
banks have {13,000,000 leas cash than at this
time last year.

yesterday's slump In the local pit. and then
was a general disposition to even up over Sun
day. Consequently May wheat began the day
fairly steady, a shade lower at 6Â» T Â»<gÂ«fc.\ and
advanced to 994 c. New York early showed an
upward tendency, an encouraging hint of a
better export demand. This, however, failed
to materialize. An Increase of local stocks of
about C<Â».O0O bushels was predicted and consid
erable long wheat was let out. all of which
was depressing. The market sagged to Â«SVÂ»ljr
65?%e. and closed HSvfcC lower tor May at Â« S
S6S4c. The volume of business was small.
New York reported 25 loads taken for export.
Local receipts were 157 cars, 33 of thÂ« contract
grade. Minneapolis and Duluth reported HI.
against 1432 last year.
Corn was steady early, sympathizing with
wheat, weakening later with that cereal and
on liberal receipts. The demand was poor and
local longs were free sellers. May closed a
shade down at i24uS2 1 4c.
Oats were firm early . and closed steady.
Tr.vle was dull and featureless and fluctuations
narrow. Little change in local stocks is pre
dicted. The shipping demand was poor. May
closed a shade over yesterday at 23V'23%c.
Provisions held firm. December ribs at one
time were ui> We? a fact due to small stocks.
Deliveries were about as expected. The
strength was due principally to a light hog
supply, and a good outside demand. Shipments
for the week were liberal, though under last
year's. The world's lard stock showed a de
crease of 63, 000 tierces for November May
pork closed 6 cents up at $9.4); May lard. 53

in the sum of JT.O a month cendinc the
tinai determination of her action.
In his opinion Judge Jones finds that
during part of the years IS7O and I*7l
she lived with John R. Hue. the de
fendant. She left him In the latter part
of ISTI and went to live near a place
called Schneiders Mill. In the early part
of 1*72 she again returned to live witn
him at Hitcs Cove and remained with
him there until 1SÂ«). when she went with
him to Indian Peak, about sixteen miles
from HUM Cove.. In Mariposa County,
and remained there till the latter part of
li&6. During this period they occupied
the same house and same room, f lite
fiaid her board, furnished her with cred
t and payed her bills at Hltes Cove and
the Alta Ranch, where they remained
and lived together until the time when lie
left Mariposa County for a trip through
Mexico. New Mexico and Arizona., mak
ing iom investments. On his return
plaintiff claims that their relation* were
changed and they became husband and
wife, and this raises th*> principal Issue
In this mÂ«p- that of marriage. The opin
ion continues:
Many u-itnrrivs have seen called anil t*s
tir,Â«Nj on lÂ»^hÂ»ir of both rartiesâ to thÂ«
number -of about one hundred-many as to
the QueMion of rejiute in Max'.posa County

.-.-.'. xriia. and by what nam<>Â« the slalntiff
Â«Â«k there known. . The large majority ff
withe**** knew her .m Hlte's wife. Mrs.
Hire, 1-ury Hit*-; ml M.mÂ» as Hlte's enuaw.
Some witness*-* knew them as hi;. band and
wife; and others that they were not huÂ»
band and wife. Some <">f the witnesses who
testified that they were not himband and
wife di-I m, on the ground that they had
n?vÂ»r known that they had a license, or
that any ceremony, either by minister,
jrieht or officer 'if the law. was ever i*r
formed. and hen they could net be husband
and wife. The defendant Hlte'n relatives
knÂ«Â»w her as LÂ«ury. But all the wltnessea
Â«be â â¢â â¢â â  the vnrtlc-s iurln* the period
practically mrr"Â«e that from the early part
O( IST? to the iÂ»;ter part of ISSO. a period of
nearly fifteen yum. the plaintiff was living
with the deVntJ.int.- and other witnesses
who kr.ew the parties f..r a shorter l>er?od
testified to the yame effect.
TL* . iilnttfT also knew Hite from her
childhood. And from the testimony she
oÂ»iiW! to be the wife of the defendant.
She testified that he Bent for her to come
and nÂ« w<ull make her hi* wife. She went
to his house. At HlteÂ« Cove, there followed
such an agreement and understanding be
tween them, that she lived with him from
1172 to KM at Hltea Cove, when he moved
to Indian Peak and established a home,
taking her with him. remaining the con
tinuously until the latter part of lÂ«Â«. mak
ing a continuous period of more than four
teen rears that he lived with her before he
became restless and went away, returning
thereafter only occasionally, bat furnishing
her support and paying her bills, even
thouch his affection for the plaintiff had
waned. ITntll he became Infatuated with
Cecelia Nous** he recognlÂ»e<i hi* obligation
to the plaintiff. And this was the first time
he made h:m.>-elf believe that the plaintiff
had no further claims on him, or for sup
port, after having recocnlzed and ae
knowiedped her to many people, some of
whom have testified here, as his wife for a
I-erlod of twenty-five years. â â¢â â 
It would be aeainst good conscience, (rood
morals and arainst the interest of society
for the court to fall to recornlie th" obli
gations thÂ« testimony shows he assumed for
that lone rerlod. â¢;. i-
The marrlare. to my mind. Is establiÂ«'"J
from the evidence, under the law of this
Hate as Jt existed prior to the adoption of
1LÂ»- codes, and John n. HI I',1 ', the def.nJ
ant. should be held to provide a support for
the . lajntiT.
Defendant Mite, though In the vigor of
manhood when he first began to live with
thÂ« plaintiff. Is now an old man: thi plain
tiff, her hair almost white with a*e, is with
out means to sustain and prosecute her ac
tion, and. as It appears, without means of
mj.j.nrt. and means should be provided as
suit money In this case in the sum of $4<yx>.
And for her support and ! maintenance the
sum of !â¢'â " ncr month during the pendency
of this action.
The plaintiff Ib entitled to a decree of di
vorce dissolving the bonds of matrimony ex
isting between the plaintiff and defendant.
Permanent support Is based on the.prop
erty rights of the partiesâ and all property
riAta were reserved to bÂ» adjusted and
tried after the court had determined the
question of marriage and temporary all
mony and expenses of suit.

useful and pretty things that are
prized by parents, while there are nu
merous tables laden with choice gifts
for those who are neither parents nor
children. Noticeable among the little
i>lgns displayed for the enlightenment
of the guests Is a poster, which unfor
tunately does not show Its bright au
thor. It reads. "Order your hassocks
here. ONLY those like samples will
be allowed In the new church." Many
orders were placed.
But although the practical side of
the bazaar Is much In evidence, the
social side has been equally well taken
care of. The corner where light re
freshments are served by many charm-
Ing young ladles continually presents
the appearance of a reception room
and gives rise to a suspicion that the
attraction Is not confined to the tea,
maecaroon or water Ice. Half a dozen
young gentlemen In snow-white wait
ers' suits passed around with their
trays of bonbons in a manner so Invit
ing that they did a business quite
brisk.
In a quaintly furnished room, amid
tapestries and lamps of Oriental pat
tern, sat the palmist, and those who
were curious to know the secrets held
by their hands could be accommodated
for a modest sum. The lad-ies noted
with gratified surprise the large
amount of Interest that was shown in
the palmist's tent.
The ladles have kept their word that
there phould be none of that Importun
ing that is so often a distasteful fea
ture of social fairs. This difficulty
has been dispensed with by the most
commendable of means. The selection
of articles and of attractions Is such
that the "spieler." by any aristocratic
name whatsoever. Is not - necessary to
aid in the dispensing of goods.
Th<Â» attendance both afternoon and
even.- was very large, and the- affair
partook largely of the- nature of a re
ception as well as a bazaar. I; will be

to them, repeated many time* After
ward, during the trial. It wan proved that
this wan a mistake; that the expression
really heard was a Fentence In French:
"No rue tue pus"â English, "do not kill
me Now. although this may seem Insig
nificant. It really had a great deal to da
with tha case, for It was never even sus
gented by the prosecution that the ar
cuned. Jones, had any knowledge of the
French language. Then why. asked the
defense, should Dutil have addressed him
In that language, knowing him to be Ig
norant of the tongue? And the expres
sion brought forth still another point.
Many witnesses who were thoroughly
conversant with the French language,
and more particularly with the manners
and customs of the people, stated posi
tively that such an expression In French
would. only be used between old 'friends,
for It contained the friendly "thou." which
amounts almost to a term of endearment,
and that a stranger could never be ad
dressed In such language. It wan mm
what strange that this vital point was
-not' more thoroughly investigated. for It
certainly meant much for. the defense of
Jones.
After the noise had ceased, which, all
the. witnesses agree, lasted for fully half
an hour, a heavy thump wan heard, as If
made by a body falling to the floor, which
was probably the case, for when the
guests entered too barroom Dutll wu
found dead. An examination proved that
he had been beaten to death with some
blunt Instrument. presumably a rock or
an Iron bolt. All the circumstances point
ed to robbery as an incentive for the
crime. The till. In which all tilt receipts
of the day were kept, was found open and
empty. Its edges covered w!th the bloody
Imprint of the murderer's ring- (AU( AU the
painted woodwork about the. doors and
windows of the room also bore evidence of
tlie Hnnin guilty, bloodstained hand. Dv-
Ill's . watch and chain, together with a
purse containing a number of strana for-
Hkh Â«olns and a peculiar seal, were also
missing.
The u>tcotlve!< went lo work on the case

Insignificant character were worked to

gave u;Â» the c;isÂ«e as hopeless, ar.d It waa
relocated. to the great Mle of undiscovered
crimes and criminals
Nothing more w.is hrard of the murder
of Dutll for sonic month*; thr-n one morn
ing the papers startled the reading pub
lic with the announcement that the mur
derer had been arrested with enough cir
cumstantial evidence on his person to
hang a dozen men The nume of the mur
derer was given as George Jones, an old
man who 'had been employed for years
a*s a caretaker in the hom<<<Â« of *ome of

announcrment Fent n shiver up and down
the pins I column of more than one good
citizen of the aaburban town, for the old
man had been trusted with valuable prop
erties and had worked for people who
kept a great. deal of money about the
house. Â
One. night Jones, who had returned from
Sa/i Francisco, where. he had been to col
lect quite a large sum of money, was dis
covered In a saloon somewhat Intoxi
cated. He was throwing his wealth about
In a reckless manner, and was advised
by the keeper- of the. place to go home.
â¢â  it was dangerous to be seen on th*
street In his condition with no much
money to tempt robbers. The old man
gave no heed to this friendly advice, and,
finally a young man named Lathrop. who
knew Jones, went out and called a po
liceman. He told the officer of the old
man's condition and of the large amount
of money he had with him. The officer
concluded, as he could not induce Jones
to go home, to lock him up until he was
sober enough to care for himself HÂ«

In the same prodigal manner, which not
only meant a useless wast* of list old
man's, money but some very hard q-u-Â»
tlona to answer from Mi Chltf la the
morning.
When they reached the City Prison It
*ai â  not considered necessary to search
the old man very thoroughly, so they Just
asked him for his money, which the ser
geant .booked, and then locked, him up In
a cell to give the old fellow a chance to
sleep off the efferts of his debauch.
' !'!.â¢â¢ next morning a strong; odor of gas

which was finally traced to the cell whero
Jones was confined. When the door was

her lions *f were startled by a stentorian
command.
"All amateur*: upstairs!"
The voice camp from somewhere In the
heavens, unmistakably emanating from
the terrifying person of the stage man
ner. As ihevohoos reverberated through
the ttarrow hallway and the tlnj orÂ«-t-sipi;
rooms underneath the stage of the Chutes
Theater there was a leaping of heart* into
throats and .1 nervous thrill of frightened
expectation.
From out each of the little cells, called
f'V courtesy '-"dressing; roomy," emerged a
ha'f-dszen or so of "amateurs " assorted
types, ace and talents. ThÂ«?re was a ma
jority r)t minstrel talent in ebony mak"

nainority being comprised of Â»ong-andÂ«

I Â»â¢ n: w Itb -hem.
We passed here and there a scornful
"professional." in blue tights, and occa
sionally received indulgent smiles from
flufflly clad souhrettes of long standing.
Then we "line.l uj>." and received our
numbers. 1 stood nt-xt to a:i cffemi'iHte
lookir.p youth with lony hair, populurly
referred to by his companions as "Lizzie."
I had bten conjecturing as t<Â» whether
this youth was a. tootbull o r.;hu.-:ast or
a violinist until he emerged from nis
dressing room as a female impersonator^
in gauze d>*c<.llete. elaborately made up
for a coon song and cakowalk.
My specialty, a Fisher's Hornpipe, was
placed for number five. In a vivid make

profusion of blon-ie curlfi 1 :iwaitrd my
turnâ and it came! Not: however, until
I had seen my four hopeful predecessors
return, crushed and vanquished, from the
arena.

greeted with a burst of renewed energy,
ar.d, the sound of the orchestra was swal

hoots the like of which I Mm heard be
foreâand only once afterwardâ for my
turn was yet to come.
She actually sang; or at least the optic

moved in time to th* words of "Because
I Love You." HoY they swelled the
chorus with parodies and variations,
while the Interludes were interspersed
with such <;ueriss as:
"Hello, mamma ; where's the baby?"
"Don't you think you've sung enough?"
"Keep it upâ don't quit: ' wouldn't if I
were you."
Another victim followed: worried
throu/Ji an inaunib!e half verse of "Just
As the Sun Went Down." darted from the
stage and nought seclusion in the dress
ing room below.
Numl â  three and four wore announced
and were greeted and sped with like en
thusiasm.
Then came an awful moment.
The name of Ada Moss, which I had
given, being deemed insufficiently pre
tentious. I was announced as Miss Ada
Buckley Deveaux.
The announcement met with a. chorus
of
WThoV*
"Ada Devaw-ii\v-A \V."
"Come- on. Ada."
The orchestra started up. and then I
suffered the momentary fepllng one ex
periences when an elevator drops
swiftly: I suddenly fcuad myself in the
center of the stage, frantically pirouetting
about, trying in vain to cttch the sound
of the music. I hail huendtd to <1 inco the
hornpipe, but it was not the h^orrrpipe that

was only conscious of ix-lng the tanret
for the â¢ â  â < and shout.* of a gnat howl-
Ing, hatless mass of humanity; and that
they laughed uproariously.
For a moment the din ceased. i caugnt
the time of the marie Md the steady eye
of the violinist- and came to myself, but
it was too late. I had not learned 'the
dance well enough to do it mechanically,
and it was Impossible to count the steps
or calculate changes in that awful bed
lam.
I started again in a series ' of Im
promptu steps, the originality of which
will never be questioned, but which, I
fear, could not claim the most distant re
lationship to the hornpipe. I doubt not
that these same steps were entirely out
of time with the music which I could not
hear. â¢ . V -
Then how they did hoot! They had only.
THE SUNDAY CALL.
howled ard laughed before and 1 had en
dured with a frenzied determination to
worry out my allotted number of minutes.
But when they hooted the horrible sensa.
tlon was Indescribable. Under the sting
of their derisive howls I finally grew de
fiant. .\~:
Strong In the knowledge that my make
up was three coatings deep, I continued to
dance about, and throughout the- rest of
those excruciating four minutes or so my
mental attitude, born of the courage of
despair, might have been expressed by the
laconic Chimmle McFadden in his trio of
well-known eloquent words.
They hurled queries at me.
"Oh, Ada. where did you get the blue
stockings?"
"Do you do your hair on curl papers or
on a table fork?"
"Keep it up. but give us a change."
When it was a!! over I rushed off the
stage, even forgetting to precipitate the
usual kiss.
â  After that I became an onlooker. I wit-
nÂ«Â»<Â«Â«Â«Â»d th- grilling of poor "Lizzie" and
the unabated enthusiasm with which
"I?ailore Isaacs." a really clever artist of
the Â«ong-ancl-dance type, was received.
Th. amateur seems legitimate prey lor
thr public, lie is provided for their es
pecial benefit and for the exclusive pur
pose of being ridiculed and booted at,
Irrespective of talent*.
DownÂ«t:iir.s in the dressing-room 1
joined In the geweral scramble for vari
ous article." of street app;*rol. I had been
fortunate enough to secure a whole nail
to myself, so I experienced hut little diffi
culty. I observed another amateur un
rarthing her wardrobe from a barrel in
which, with much forethought, she had
stowed it.
The scraps of conversation to be heard
In the dressing-rooms, if not edifying, were
certainly amusing.
I overheard a heavy masculine voice in
the direction of the professionals' dress
ing-rooms relating a misfortune that had
overtaken a friend. /#,-:
"We'd all been cutting into th" grape,"
said he, "pretty lively, and Billy had a
bun on; he pulled out of th' swish and
went down th' main drag to th' stem
two forty, spotted an old guy what locked
like a jasper and pinched him for a
ticker, but the guy was a bull, and he
went to the bat cave."
The narrative being somewhat modified
for me I gathered that the particular set
of which the Illustrious Billy was a mem
ber bad been indulging liberally in wine,
and that Billy had become bttosfeated;
he had left his friends and gone dnwn
Market street to Third and Kearr.y.
where he had encountered an old gentle
man who looked invitingly "rasy," and
had appropriated his watch: but to the
misfortune of Billy the old gentleman was
a policeman In disguise, and Billy had
been thrown into jail.
Snatches of such touching ballads as
"She Bhould Be Scolded, but Not Turned
Adrift." and "Just a Splinter From My
Sweetheart's Wooden Leg." mingled with
such banter and pleasantries as-
"Say, sis, the switch you wear don't
match your hair."
"Close your face, y'u, nit, yÂ«u."
(Ohen the Amateurs Came On.
"Aw - \van, you always send â  ftllow
winging."
"Better vine it. then."
The tormentor "winged." In other
words, ho v .it.! his way. and in passlnjc
admonished "Lizzie" as to getting "a hair
cut," and was t"i'l In reply] to get his
physiognomy repaired, or words to that
effect]
I also caught a rumor of an accident:
- mm one had fallen "off a water wagon."
On Inquiring into the disaster I learneti
that the extent of the misfortune was
that thÂ»: person In question had taken to
drinking again.
Who are they, whence do they com?,
and why? Some of thorn are shop girls
and factory aids; some â â .' them "have
husbands with small Incomes." and some
of them are only ambitious. The mascu
line element come from like sources.
The Kreater portion are "out for the
dough there is in It," to quote their own
words. There are those who expect to
"get a regular position" on one of these
stages, and some of the youths are ob
viously there for the fun and amusemen*.
they nnd in the experience.
They are not all of the class Indicated
by the scraps of conversation Quoted A
group of different type ticietly discussing
the Bubject In a corner spoke of the em
barrassment they were often subjected to
by chance meetings with the rest on the
street, and related bits of experience In
which they had been hailed with lusty In
quiries a* to whether they were "going
08/" to-night, or as to what specialty they
would appear in. This type of experience.
in the language of the offenders, is called
a "ball out."
The 811-penradtllg Â«â¢ ntiment is that the
â  shall survive.
This spirit is particularly noticeable in
the turmoil of the crowded dr>
rooms, where an uninterrupted peep HitJ
the mirror in alnv.-si an impossibility,
where pins are at a premium and
makeup, unle?* put under careful guard,
becomes common property without any
process except of th*Â» unwritten law >>{
the unprovided.
The next night at the Olympia i found
them all.
Lizzie nor* â  .new gown of pink and
grcn: Jj-adore Isaacs ventured a
brilliant r/hlstcoat of beaded satin with
an immaculate linen suit. The feminine
portion â¢of the amateur!* buali i tbra
selres in more commodloua quart* In
affecting new combinations of t.llet, and
with chit-that apropos of amateur stage
doings in general.
Now and ttien we encountered a "pro
fessional" who wore the same scornful
visage I bad mitt, the ii ib iu before.
I met one on the stairs who cheerfully
grejste'd'me with the words "Hello, Ama
teur!"
When all of us had â¢ â â¢!. â¢<â¢!! our
elaborate makeups and I;ad nothing:
further to do but wait, there was a rji:iet
/rathering in the halls, and â  . .in of
"tag"; the KirN pulled Link I urls -tmi
annoyed "Sullivan" the clog dancer;
Isidore Isaacs bested make-up from all
who would contribute and helped himself
to the stock of those who would not.
The regular programme of son*, nance
and farce was going on upstairs, as we
knew from the thumping on the stage
floor above, and the distant sound of
music. We were In no great hurry to
ascend, and were not troubled by thÂ«
length of the programme, but at last our
peace was rudely broken into by the
voice of the stage manager; the latter
being, however, much less formidable an
individual than the one who had
frightened us gut of our wit* the night
before.
I was number seven, and was flown fof
th*Â» same specialty, very much determined
to acquit myself with more credit.
As before, a vocalist was let loos* upon
thr audience tint.
She had anticipated the result, and no
thins daunted, sans away at them. The
hootlns and howling dM not cease until
she had come to the conclusion of "Only
Me," and bowed herself out.
Th"-<Â» who danced were more fortunate
than rh- â .-â¢â â¢ who chose to sins. They could
not interrupt the dancing.
I had profited by my "experience of tho
niffht before, and had Rone over my step*
until I could .! Â» them fairly well, mechan

affable atid courteous !<tase manager, who
accosted me with a query as to how I was

While I was putting on my hat a num

the explanation that they were going to
"make the Thalia if they could."
They evidently did. for as my friends

If he had ESO Â«o spare for a few days, <.f

plied that he might be able to scrape up
that amount, but that it would be neces

of a R<x*l man by way of Â».ecurtty. "Char

Jones paced the lower deck Of the boat,
turning over in his mind the many strange
things that had come into his life since
he started from home that eventful morn
ing 1 , and each time, as he covered the
length of the deck, ho was obliged to pass
the little screen door behind which they
see such nice thing? to drink. And what
is more natural, when a man Is worried,
than to get on the other side of that door?
Well. Junes did. and he got there more
frequently than was really good for him;
vo that by the time he had reached the
Oakland side his wit was out and the
drink was In. Of course he proceeded to
do exactly what he should have avoided,
namely, develop the more than incipient
Jag he had start. on the boat.
This was a fatal mistake on the part
of Jones, for the more he thought over
the strange fatality that had given him
possession of the now thoroughly trouble
some "collateral. 11 the more he drank,
and. consequently, the more indiscreet he
became. The story of the prosecution
tells the reader the result of his Indiscre

State as Warden of San yu'ntln prinon,

ihe man proved of no use as a witness
for either side, for he stubbornly Insisted
that he knew nothing about Jones, or the
alleged transaction. Although the man
could not give anything like a satisfac
tory account of his movements on that
particular day. still, the defense found It
Impossible to prove anything against him.
Mr. Halo tried one experiment which
convinced him that there wum some foun
dation in the statement of Jones. He
borrowed "Charlie's" clothes and put
them on one of his trusties and then
paraded the trusty, accompanied by sev
eral others, past the cell where Jones was
confined. Jones at once recognized the
clothes, and called- to the man. although
his face was kept purposely turned away
from the prisoner. "Charlie!" he ex
claimed, "you are the very man I want
to see." He wu told that he was mis
taken, that the man he had called to
was not "Charlie." but one of the ihen In
the Jail. Still Jones Insisted that It was
"Charlie," and that he knew and recog
nized every rag worn by the person who
had Just passed his cell. On this point,
the old man's belief remains unshaken to
this day. All this made the Sheriff more

there were still other points that wore

Then how cculd he have known there irai
anything worth stealing about the place,

are all hard questions to answer, and
leave a very fair margin for reasonablo

Shoemakers and haberdashers who eat**
to the wnnts of the elite assert that the'r

shoes averaging from one-half to on. Â«â¢
a half sizes larger than they did five v M n
ago. The majority of the. dealers bclleva
that the average length and breadth of
men's feet have been steadily Increasing
since the wane of thÂ«Â» fashion which de
manded a pointed to* and UÂ«ht-ruii n ,
shoe.
This they explain by saying that the
effect of th.< style In vogue six >-Â .- nco
wan to cramp and .dlitort the natural de
velopment of the feet. When the style
changed and comfort became the criterion
of fashion nature again exerted Itself
Feet which had become distorted during
the reign of the narrow shoe and pointed
toe slowly began to broaden and adapt
themselves to their new surroundings
The change, being gradual, went for a
long- time unnoticed, and not until tho
merchants recently began to compare
their sales of live years ago with those of
to-day was It noticed that the average In

Several well known shoe dealers Bald
that when they first began to notice the
apparent change they became Interested
and studied the problem. Thoy found that
when fashion demanded the use of arrow
shoes feet were closely confined and by
degrees became small. As styles changed
and an easy fit was alone desired the feet
seemed to expand and grow steadily
larger until the fashion again required a
small, neat Coot, when the process would
be repeated.
One merchant, versed in ancient and

Coffee Receipts.
Much has been from time to time writ
ten on the subject of coffee as a beverage,
the degree or fineness. to which it should
be ground, the method and extent of Its
roasting, the quality of the berry Itself
and the make of coffee pot best adapted
to Its preparation having all received their
due share of attention. But so far not
much has been said of the many ways in
which it can be used In sweet dishes, and
therefore the following recipes may prove
of interest to those who appreciate its
flavor: .â¢-.'.

Looking back on the fourth fifth and

no out- alleged a "fake" or- dreamed of
doing so, because the punishment that he
gave Charleniont was serious. Drlscoll

Meanwhile Brighten, ten miles outside
of Paris, is building â  "proper" bull-ring,
to become the professed home of the
sport near the capital. 1 was present at
the first tragic fiasco In which the bull
escaped: and I repeat that we must won
der at the unpreparndhess of all this new
sporting effort. There was nothing to
protect the audience but a flimsy .wooden

Canker had to place him In arrest
and prefer charpes. When asked if
he was mre of his ground in making
co teriou? an accusation, he declared
he had proof positive, at least he

boy alone with him to he tried there by
c-.urt-m.mial. where -no meddling out

himself out Â«<f my jurisdiction, and that
he resented n>y stiitl officer.-; questions.
Hut Dr. Morrow had appealed to me in
behalf of Gray. Bald thai if romp-lied

I ordered him taken off and placed in

xvithout him. Hut 1 wish you would seÂ»
Armstrong and tell him about Gray so
that 1 may kt.ow the whole situation aÂ«
foon as I return, Canker evidently in
tended not to )cx us know his proofs. He
probably believes that he will tlnd a morÂ©
credulous and complaisant listener in
Drayton; but his insinuations pointed to
Gray hs at least an abettor in the theft
nrd he went ao far as to say that If Arm.
ttrong could be brought before the court
some, very Interestlns testimony could be
dragged from him. and. iin'aily. that
both Armstrong and Mrs.â well. the
wij. of a staff â¢jrhe.-r who is already well
on the way to Manilaâ might be" com
pelled to testify. I cannot brine myself
to repeat more that he said: but he* was
In uk!v and almost defiant mood, and I
had to give him a dressing down. You
ma) sa> to Armstrong for me that I do
not believe one word of Â« 'anker's calumny
at his expanse or that of the lady in thÂ«
casÂ«-. Hut he declared his intention of
!a>inp the whole matter before General
Drayton immediately on his arrival, and
it i.Â» best that Armstrong should be pre
pared. Ac for the lady. Canker said she
and Armstrong were very close friends

years ago, though they no longer meet

And that brings me to another matter.
.1 declined positively to allow two or threa
l.Hiii s. wives of otuurrs. to go on to Manila
with Canker* â¢ command: and they said
that as I had promised Mrs. Harrison a
passage 1 had no right to refuse ;h.-m.
Pressed lor their authority, two very
estimable women told me that, at 'he
Presidio two days before we sailed Mrs.
Garrison rjenly boasted of having my
promise â¢â¢â¢ send her on the very next
fteamer. .\"< w. who is really the fabri

But Armstrong knew much less than ho
hiir.i.elf believed. Hastening back to camp
nnd ordering his horse, he was soon
*lÂ»f*Â»ding up the slope to the wind-swept
heights overlooking the CJolden Gate. The
morning had opened fine as Fllk. but by
noon thÂ«Â« sky was hidden in clouds and
th* breath of thÂ« sea blew In salt and
strong. The whltecaps were leaping on
the crest of the surges driving In through
the straits and the surf bursting high
on th* Jagged rocks at the base of the
cliff*. A little coast steamer from Santa

in from sea, and one or two venturesome
craft. herlinÃ far to leeward, tore through

what would be her sensations. Down the
tvindlnK. sloping road he urped his way
<^l*Â»neoe. his pet charger, marveling at
the uiiuiÂ«uel palt. The cape of the sen
try's overcoat whirled over the sentry's
hond and e wished his cap off as he pre
sented arms to the tall soldier spurnns
r-apt the .ardhouÃO "I envy no one who
has to put to sea this day." said Arm-
Ftronc to himself, as he. turned to the
right and reined up In front of a little
brown cottace peepinir out from a muss
cf vines and roecs. shivering In the wet
wind. Half a dozen strides took him
â¢.cross the narrow walk and up the wood
en steps. With sharp emphasis he
clanged the little gong hell screwed to
the oack of the door and waited Im
patiently of the servant's coming. There
was no answer. He rang again and still
again and no one came.
A glance at the windows told that the
white lace curtains hung there draped as
prettily as ever. Fresh flowers stood on
the window sill. A shawl and a pillow,
tl c latttr indented as by a human head,
lay in the lounging chair on the little
porch. Another chair etood but a few
f.-.-t away. There was even a fan, though
fans In a Frisco summer are less needed
than fur*; but nowhere saw he other sign
of the temporary mistress of the house.
He went round to a side window and
rapped No answer. Then he turned to
the walk again, and. taking the reins,
bade the orderly Inquire next door If Mrs.

marching over from the malodorous sand
lots nnd settled down in sheltered nooks
about the Presidio. So cavaliers In plenty
were still to be had. cavaliers whose wives
and sweethearts, as a rule were far
away; and Mrs. Frank loved to console
such as were so bereft.
The chafing dish and Scotch and soda

men who didn't at all fancy Mrs. Frank,
and s;>okc dcs=plt*Â»fully of her among

of those* who deeply felt the separation

forbidden themselves, heard with envy
and cvÂ« n distress her gay assertion that
she would rail for Manila the moment

her no evil, or course; but if they were
themselves forbidden how could they re
joice, that she should be permitted? They
were actually beginning to feel a bit -
charitable toward her when the Queen "
of the Fleet herself came In from Hono
lulu with the latest news. The fifth ex
pedition had been halted there and put in
camp. The hospital held several officers.
Billy Qray was down with brain fever. "

herself up In her room -an entire : day.' ~
Now for nearly a fortnight, the lovely
guest had been dally hinting that she re

surely tired of her; and Wltchle dis

must go, and Wltchle consented without

ed and trotted for the east gate. The road
was lined with camps and volunteer* ,at
drill. Vehicles were frequently moving to
and fro: but the sentry at the entrance
had kept track of them, and In response
to question answered promptly and posi
tively Mrs. Garrison's carriage had not
come that way. "But. said he, "the
wagon with the lady's baggage did. I
saw the name on the trunks."
The colonel turned In his saddle and
coolly sun-eyed him. "Do you mean Mrs.
Stockman's name?" he asked In a quiet
tone. "How many trunks were there?"
"Oh. Nome of them might have had
Mrs. Stockman's name, sir; but the two
or three that I saw were marked M. O."
This was unlooked for news. To her
next door neighbor Mrs. â  Garrison had
*M<l nothing about going away with Mrs.
Stockman, and Armstrong had grave
need to see her and to see her at once.
The train tor Los Angelas did not leave
until evening. Possibly they were lunch

headquarters. Some of the siaff might

of them justified it.
"Did 1 happen to meet Mrs. Garrison?
Yes. I fust saw her aboard the China."
"Aboard the China!" exclaimed Arm
strong, with sudden thrill of excitement.
D*you mean she is going?"
"Didn't ask her. They were hustling
everybody ashore, and I bad only time to
give dispatches to Punier; but she was on
the deck with friends when 1 came
away." -
People wondered that day at the speed
with which the tall officer, followed by
his orderly, clattered away down Market
street. In less than ten minutes Arm
strong was at the crowded pier and push
ing through the throng to the China's
Mage. Too late! Already It was swung
aloft, the lines were cast loose and the
huge black mass was just beginning to
back slowly from Its moorings. The rail
of the promenade deck swarmed with
faces, some radiant, some tearful. Words
of adieu, fluttering kerchiefs, waving
hands, tossing flowers were there on every

was deaf to both. Eagerly, anxiously, in

crowded rail, and all of a sudden saw
her. Yes, there she stood, all gayety,
grace and animation, stylishly gowned
and fairly burdened with roses; and It was

smiling, nil sweetness, all confiding, trust-

he said 'Thank you." and took It. a thorn

> CHAPTER XIV.
Mid October. .ue Queen of the Fleet,
the finest transport of the Pacific service,
thronged with boys In blue at last ordered
on to Manila, lay at the wharf at Hono
lulu, awaiting her commander's order* to
cast loose. In strong foroe and with
stentorian voices, the Primeval Dudes
Joined In rollicking chorus to the crash-
Ing aoooiD pa.nl ment of their band and,
when they could take time to rest, the
crowd ashore Â«et up a cheer. The Ha
weltan National Band, In spotless white,
forming a huge and melodious circle on
the wharf, vied with the musicians from
the States In the spirit and swing of their
stirring airs. "Aloha Oe! Aloha Oe!"
chorused the surging throng, afloat and
aahore, a* wreaths and garlandsâ lets
of the Islandersâ were twined or hung
about some favorite officer or favored
roan. The troops still held to service In
Hawaii shouted good will and good-by
to those ordered on to the Philippines.
The Dudes of the Queen, and the lads
from the prairies and the mountains on
other transports anchored fn the deep but
narrow harbor, yelled soldierly condolence
to those condemned, to stay. The steam
of the 'scape pipe roared loudly and
belched dense white clouds on high, swell
ing the uproar. Dusky little Kanaka boys,
diving for nickels and paddling tireless
about the ship, added their shrill cries to
the clamor. The captain, In his natty
uniform of blue and gold, stepped forth
upon the bridge to take command, and
rained his banded cap In recognition of
the constant cheer from the host ashore
and the throng of blue shirts on the fore

And then there uprose another shout
a 2 ut ," f mi Â»Kled merriment, surprise
and applauM-; fc, r all on a sudden there
darted up the stairway from the crowded
promenade to the sacred perch above,
defiant of the lettered warning. "Passen

deck below looked at one another and
gasped Two brave army girls, wives of
wounded officers In the Philippines, who
by special dispensation were making the
voyage on the Queen, glanced quickly at
each other nnd saidâ nothing audible. "The
general, lifting bis cap. but looking both
deprecation and embarrassment, fell back
and gave his place at the white rail to the
new arrival, and colored high when she
suddenly turned and took his aim. The
captain, trying not to see h<-r or to appear
conscious of this infraction of a stringent
rule and Invasion of h!s dignity, grew
redder as he shouted rapid orders and
swung his Wg be.-mtlful ship well out into
the stream. The guns of the HÂ« nnington
boomed a deafening salute as the Queen

the passenger list, entirely at home, if not

Leaning on the general's arm an hour
later and deftly piloting that bewildered
veteran up and down the breezy deck, she
came. Just as she had planned to come,
face to face once more with Stanley Arm
strong A\ell she knew that under the es-
Mffi of that exalted rank she was safe
from any poeslbllty of cross-question or
interference. Well she knew that had he
heard of her sudden determination to go
to Honolulu she could not have escaped
stern interrogation, possibly something
worse; and her heart failed her when she
realized that the man who had gauged her
shallow nature years before now held a
lash over her head In the shape of the
paper that mad vanity had prompted her
to write and send to the officer of the
guard the day that Stewart sailed. What
madness it was. indeed, yet how could
phe have dreamed it would fall into the
hands of the man of all others she feared
and respectedâ the one man who, had he
but cared, oould years ago have had
her love, tha man who, because he cared
not, had won her hate I And. now that he
held or had held thia paperâ nothing less
than a forged order In her husband's
name a* aid de caxap to General Drayton.
she could have cowered at his feet In her
terror of him. ret braved him with smllea,
sweetness and g&yety, with arch merri
ment and Joyous words, Quitting for the
moment the general's arm that she might
extend to him both her little white-gloved
hands. Gravely he took the left in his
left, while with the right he raised his
forage cap In oomblned salute to the
woman and to his superior officer. Gravely
and almost Instantly he released It, and
listened in helpless patience to her torrent
of playful words; but his eyes were on the
general's face as though he would ask
could he. the general, know the true
character of the woman he had honored
above all her sisterhood on board. In thus
taking her to the bridge whereon neither
oftVer nor man nor nurse nor army wife
had presumed to set foot on all the six
days run from Ban Francisco, as though
he would ask if the general knew Just
what she was. this blithe, dainty, win
some little thing that nestled so con
fidinglyâlndeed, so snuglyâ close to his
battered side, and who had virtually
taken possession of htm In the face of
an envious and not too silent circle of her
own sex.
Truth to tell, the chief would rather
have escaped. He was but an Indifferent
sailor, and the Queen's long, lazy roll over
the ocean surges was exciting in his Inner
consciousness a longing for cracked Ice
and champagne. He had known her but
the few days the Queen remained in port,
coaling and preparing for the onward voy
age across the broad Pacific; but â  great

but when later she backed him into the
coolest corner of the "lanal," with the
plash of fountain close at hand, and the
sweet music of Berger's famous band
floating softly on the evening air, aifd told
him how her father had loved to talk of

aboard, was compelled to share his lit

no place for Mrs. Garrison aboard, es

three, a surgeon and two officers going
forward from Honolulu; and one of
these .was. our old friend and once., light
hearted Billy Gray, now nearly conval
escent, but weak and. as aH-could see
feverishly eager to get on to Manila
All this was explained to the Senator
It â  was even suggested that there was
room for Mrs. Garrison on the Louisiana,
a safe old tub, if she was slow; but Mrs.
Frank looked so pathetic and resigned
when this arrangement was suggested
that no one had the hardihood to ac
tually dwell upon It, and the Senator said
It was a shame to think of It. With
whom of her own sex could she associate
on that long, hot voyage ahead of them?
Why not transfer some of the Red Cross
nurses to the Louisiana? Mrs. Garrison
had no objections, but they had: and
the surgeon In charge made prompt and
vigorous protest. He knew Mrs. Frank
and she know him. and did not in the
least despair. She still had a plan. There
was a cozy dinner one eveningâ the
evening before the departure of the
Queen, and the gallant captain of the
pnlp, the veteran general, the quarter
master In charge of transportation, the
member of the Senate Military Commit
tee, some charming girlsâ none so
charming as Mrs. Garrisonâ were of the
party There was some sentiment and
much champagne, as a result of which at
lam the big-hearted sea monarch
aforementioned swore by the bones of
his ancestors in the slimy grasp of Davy
Jones that that sweet little woman
shouldn't have to go a-begging for ac
commodations on his ship. If the gen
eral would condescend to move Into his
room, by thunder, he'd sleep up In his
foul-w*ather den next the chart room
and Mrs. Garrisonâ God bless her!â could
take the general's room and be queen
of the ship queen of the Queenâ queen
of queens by Jupiter, and here's her
health with all honor! A soldier, of
course, could be ii" less gallant than .a
sailor, especially* as the captain's room
was a bit better than the "Boudoir and
had an lcechcst and contents that the
veteran campaigner was bidden to con
sider his own.' The agreement was
clinched that very night before the
party broke up; and little Mrs. Frank
shed tears of gratitude upon the general's
coatslceve and threw kiss after kiss to
the handsome sailor as she buna over
tho balusters of the broad veranda and
waved them away in their swift-running
cabs, and then danced off to her room
and threw bersell on the b.Â».i after a
mad pirouette about the spacious apart
ment, and laughed and laughed until
real tears trickled from her eyes, and
then nave orders to be called at 7
o'clock. She meant to be up and aboard
that ship with all her luggage before
sense and repentance could come with
the morning sunâ before either soldier or
sailor could change his mind.
To the amazement of the women al
ready aboard, to the grave annoyance of
Colonel Armstrong, to the Joy of poor
Hilly Gray and the mischievous merrt
ment of several youngsters on the com
missioned list, Mrs. Frank Garrison, the
latest arrival, became sole occupant of the
Ones! room on the ship: and It was a
bower of lilies and tropical fruit and flow

the bay of Honolulu.

Besides, the wear and tear consequent on

which Is of Itself a great saving. Armed
with a single pneumatic cleaner, one man

All the world pricked up its "multi
tudin ms ears" when the success of
American builders In raising thoroughly
finished bridges In Africa within a hither
to uhapproached time limit was estab
lished beyond a doubt. The pre was
very busy and patriotic on the subject,
but forgot entirely to slat? the reason
why the superior swiftness and workman
ship of our engineers bad been made- pos
sible. The writer personally visited the
works of the firm which erected the At-
B.ira nnd other bridge?, only to find what
he already had suspected, that the true
secret of its SUCCESS, aside from an ad
mii.ti system of organization, was at
tributed to the extensive employment." of
pneumatic machines. The most difficult
and time-consuming work, which was for
merly done by band, la now done it â 
much oulckcr rate and in better shape by
air tools in every modern American bridg"
â hop. There Is a long list of pneumatic
tools. It includes piston air drills, rotary
drills, casting cleaners, air motor hoists,
reamers, dpi n and so on. all of which
enter into the work of modern construc
tion, accelerating production immensely
while improving the product.

there are a few things In the way of "air
novelties" which are most interesting.
Take the work of basket making: Surely
no one ever heard of any of the old ma
chines turning out ISO bushel baskets per
hour, or 150) baskets per day. but a com
pressed air basket-making machine is
now doing M at the Michigan basket fac
tory. TrH verse City, Mich. ThÂ« staves of
the baskets are fastened to the hoops by
staples of wire taken from the coil. Joined
and driven by the machine. The stave.-,
radiate from a center in a disk-like shape!
To bend them into the Una of the basket
form, four processes of movements are
â Bade by the machine, all or which are
automatic and obtained by the medium of
compressed air. The whole combination
Is very simple. The air is not cooled, and
tte machine runs ten hours even' work

Then there Is the fountain air brush.

The pneumatic nail tube dispatch sys
tem is familiar to mo3t readers, but the
fact that previous to 1534 it was practi
cally unknown In this country, and that
since then we have made swifter strides
in that Held than Kurope. may not be
generally known. Five years ago wht-n
John Wannamaker as Postmaster Gen
eral opened the first pneumatic mail tube
line, extending from the poÃtofflce to the
house In Philadelphia, the start was made
on entirely new lines. While to this day
in Europe they are usuig little two and
three inch tubes for telegrams only, we
began at the outset by constructing six
inch tubes, and use them to transport
mall In large quantities. Tubes had never
been used successfully for the transmis
sion of ordinary mail matter before.
The mail tube industry has now Â£â¢â¼*Â«
oped so fast In this country that even
eight-inch tubes with cartridges carry
ing 6iÂ» letters are ir successful operation
In our big cities. The longest circuit
ever built in the world is the main Una

an eight-inch tube circuit, and the car
tridges travel at tremendous speed. thÂ«
time consumed in dispatching In either
direction being only seven mlnu An
other big circuit has been laid across thÂ«
Brooklyn bridge, so that you may havt

eight-Inch projectile from a modern
breech-loader. A total of seventeen mile*
of eight-Inch tubes have been laid under
ground in this country since August 1.
1899, which shows the rapid increase of
the system.
A method of sweeping and cleaning
railroad depots by compressed air Mow
ers has been instituted by the Central
Railroad of New Jersey. It has been
found ther^ that sweeping and ecr Â»r<Mn 4
and cleaning can be done far more effec
tually with air than In any ctner way.
Ganj?s of men furnished with co: ;presaÂ«4
air blowers axe turned looac after wor.
ing hours upon the floors of the var'ous
buildinps. They go over every Bqu&rÂ«
inch of surface, and over the walis md
the furniture with their blower*, which
sweep every speck of dust and dirt be
fore them, doing the work much btrtter
than double the help could do wtth
brooms. The railroad hands have found
many unlQue uses for the comp.'csaed
air. which is so handy for" them They
find that it will clean clothes and rtn<i
fabrics as well as plush seats ant* car
pets, and dozens of them take their
clothes and uniforms to the men who
handle the compressed air to be cleaned.
The work takes but a few seconds. Is
dona thoroughly and has the advantage
of costing nothing. ' -.

use of the foil and blade as can be found
anywhere In Europe.

although all recruits have a certain
amount of exercise with hot! weapons.
The classes an first given wooden guns
to drill with, and are taken in squads of
about ten under an Instructor who puts
them through the various thrusts and
parries until they are prollclent enough
to use the contest bayonet which is blunt
and telescopes into the barrel of the gun
when the adversary is hit, thus prevent
ing accidents.
In the calisthenlc drill, the entire class
is taken ill one time by the serneuut
major, assisted by the corps of Instruc
tors. On tine days the exercise i<Â« taken

these line specimens of physical power
going through the exercises with all the
military precision of a drill.
In walking the men are given about
one hundred yards on their toes with
the shoulders thrown far back, the
chin raised and the hands on the hips:
during the last twenty-five yards the
walk Is quickened almost to a run and

Another walk is a quick stvp with the
body straight and the arms at the side,
walking with the flat foot and the heel.

toes for some few minutes is hard work
arid at the same time the best of exor
cise for developing the legs. After keep
ing up this motion until the perspira
tion fairly pours from their bodies, the
men are given a rest in the shape of
a stiff leg trot or some exercise of thÂ»Â«
arms. For fully fifteen minutes they

ments. When the order is Riven to
"stand at ease" they stamp the right
foot sharply to the ground and slap
their hand!" In unison as they come to
"easy position." The Fame motion Is
used when th>> men are drilling and
makes a very pretty and effective
movement, although it - ; - â¢ma waste of
energy when compared to the natural
manner in which our American men at
arms come to "parade r^st." So also

There is a movement on foot in the
English War Office to do away with many
of the cumbersome portions of the uni
form* such as the great bearskin shakos
â worn by the Scots Guards, or the gor
geous but heavy cuirass of the Horse
Guards. Many also favor following the
< xample of the American army and
adopting a uniform for the army, thus
doing away with the regimental uniform.

uniform worn to-day that was worn a

It li almost impossible to enumerate the
many features of the callsthenlc drill, f.ir
it has almost as many changes as there
are movements of th> body. Even the
turning of the wrist is included in the
exercise, Tho raising of the arms above

is one of the most useful of all. for it is
not always the most fatiguing work
which does the* body the most good. For
the lees and fret thÂ«Â» squad first stands
straight with tho hands on the hips and
then bonds the knee* to a sitting posture,
at tho same time rising on the toes. It
is in reality sitting on the heels, and
raising again, repeated many times.

In fact all of these exercises are much
harder than they seem.
Dumbbells are much used in the

An unusual and Inten itlng ex.-rcl*e Is
done with the "shelf." The "j=helf" i*

shelf on the side wall just nut of reach

put themselves liable to all of the lotto*
that are imposed upon iâ¢ â¢â¢ recruits or

th<* privates, and the only distinction that
they receive Is that they xtand on thÂ«Â»

Hoxlng is given far more attention in
the English army than in any other of
the world and Is really ionsiderÂ«l a
ren.u!*ite part of the soldiers education.
Regular tournaments are held for th<i

classes, there being one series of con
tests for officers and one for th*Â» men.
The British recruit* are a class entirely
different from our soldiers. They arc re
cruited principally In city slums, and
would be worthless If left to themselves.
But with training thÂ»y make excellent
soldiers. Their !ow standard of intelli

army, and even more so In the other ar
