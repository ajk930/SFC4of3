ir^EVKi'.Al- weeks ago i wrote aa
L^ article on luy countrymen, little
dreaming that it would attract
IJ more than passing Interest. But
from strange and uuexpei ted
places X receive letters asking for
In formation and oaring sympathy.
I have been revested t" writ" home
thlr.c about thf person'jilJtie* of General
Joubert and Corn Paul. Innumerable
character sketches of Oom Paul cave
been publish" d since the Transvaal nas
taken thÂ«* crntcr of the political stage.
Of Genrr;il Joubert l<*Â«s has been written,
and llttlo of that gives an insight Into
tb* character of General Plet JoubÂ«rt.
When 1 was .t little girl, lust abl- to
â¢tumble lhmuch KnjjHsh sentences. Oom
Plet gave mo a letter to read. a. le'.ter
written in a lame English hand. I havo
read th-t letter aguln and aga!n. and
though it Js oÂ«w several years since I
hayÂ« pern it. tho words are pigeon-holed
Is my memory
â¢"Gencr.il Joubert: In the midst of the
terrible rrlcf thnt hi overtaken me I
writÂ© to tliar.k you for your kind m- *-
tage of Rympathy and your generous net
ta returning my husband's sword.
"It was iio dishonor for my hushrÂ»n<l to
)câ In bi.it!e to such a noble and brayÂ«
Ban. In this terrible war I hope y ur
wife will not suffer tho same grief that
lam now enduring "
Just how the letter, close* I havo fcr
rotten. But It was written by Lady
Frances Colley. wldon- of General Blr
Oeorga Colley, open receiving her hus
band's sword and heiznet from General
loofesrt.
Often over "Kopple Kofflf" Oom Plet
would tell us of the war of 'SO and 'U,
:: i .-.:: r .is thrill with patriotism and
weep ov:r the dÂ»*ad. I, for one. niied
more tears over the story of Sir George
Colley's death than over my Boer rela
tive*.
It Is impossible for mÂ«Â» to paint the
scene 1n English. Imagine the old gen
eral, a man over 70 years of ajre, *vith
hi* children and grandchildren, nieces
and nephews clustering around h!m. let
ting their coffee ktow cold to listen spell
bound. Impatiently resenting the pipe
puffs with which be punctuated his m-a
temes.
Then the mixture of pride and pity with
which hÂ«Â» to!d It. Wo could see the great
Ensrllfh genera.!. Sir George Colley. gasping
in Oom Piet's armsâ around him the tv-ad
and dying soldiers. Sir Geotge handed
O*m i let hfs sword a: helmet, and Jost
*!>Â» forÂ«* lie breathed his last said, "You
are tho bravest general and Â»oldlÂ»r I
have ever met in any battle."
General Plet Joubert. as becomes the
"bravest pent'.emnn and soldier," sent the
â word and helmet to the, widow of thÂ«
general, and she In turn thanked him, not
a Met of bitterness tinting her grati
tude.
I doa*t know whether Lady CoUej- la Ut-
Ing or dead, but I do know that that let
ter of hers is one of the most prized pos
sessions in the Joubert family. I know,
moreover, that none mourned more sin
cerely the death of her husband than
General Plet Joubert.
Oora-Piet's house In Pretoria Is rather
more modern and pretentious than the
President's. Like Oom Paul, ho was first
a rancher and then a mine owner, and a
very wealthy one. 11 â â¢ has most of tne
modern comforts In bis home and many
of the luxuries.
In our country money does not put bolts
or bars on rich men's doors. They swing
as wide welcome for pauper as for noble
man. Bo all classes are seen at General
Joubert's; rich and poor are greeted with
the Fame hospitality, none leaving with
out 'â¢Repp!* Koffle," many carrying away
something more substantial.
I fear 1 have given the impression that
General Joubert is a talkative, demon
strative man. To the contrary, ho Is very
quiet, his speech seldom growing Impas
sioned, and then only on the subject of
war. Withal there is something so kindly
about him that you give him confidence
Irresistibly. The children In our family
worship "him.
We In Africa call Joubert our "Napo
leon,** and consider him as fine a strate
gist as the "Little Corporal. His general
â hip Is never questioned, the burghers wi
der him flrhtlrm >â  th.Â« soldier does who
has full faith In his commander.
General Joubert has always taken prcat
Interest in training the young Boer for
the life of the soldier. Ilia confidence In
their lighting qualities was shown by his
oft-quoted remark while drafting men for
the front In 'SI. He counted one Boer to
ten Englishmen, Baying. "There, I think
that ought to be enough."
ThÂ« Boers are taught foreign tactics of
warfare. Since the years of '80 . and '81
they have been Instructed by the finest
masters of gunnery from Germany and
France. But there are not the distinc
tions In the Boer army that exist elise
where. True, there are officers and pri
vates, but that Is a military distinction,
not a social one. The private may be a
â on of his commanding officer. The atti
tude of private and officer Is more like
that In the American volunteer army than
In any regular army.
Oom Paul once said that If the English
built walls as high as those of Jericho
around- the Transvaal the Boers would
live for ten years. The last war taught
the Boers to train the second and third
generations In modern warfare and to
husband supplies.
Oom Paul and General Joubert are both
devoted churchmen and leaders in the
two dlTisttme of the Dutch church.
'â¢om Paul's wife. Tant Zlna. Is an Inva
lid and, like mosi iiuers, vry rei:.
Fl>r her sake Oom Paul had a church
built directly aorui-a the utrt-t-t from their
home, so that she can attend services
wltd little Inconvenience.
Oorn Paul and Oom Plet have traveled
some. General Joubeft more extensively
than the President. DurlnK President
Harrisons administration General and
Mrs. Joubert were entertained at the
White House and trareled as far West as
no. General Joubert always speaks
with gr*at pleasure of his American tour
and, like President Kruger, expresses ad
miration for the Americans.
Boor disrespect for the HrltiÃh and their
â overelpn has b*^en quoted and exagger
ated. What of Hrltlsh aiirwpsot for the
Boer? The following scone I myself wit
nessed crossing the Church Square with
my mother. President Kruger came to
ward us. when an Englishman, newly ar
rived, hastily put himself between us.
1 of saluting the President as a
, man If ti â¢ .Id. he de
turned and bowed, facing not
the President, but tho opposite buildings.
The Incident went the rounds and
aroused so much r< sentment that the man
was arrested and released only upon
promising to apologize for bis stupid
rudeness. OÂ©tn Paul wai not more In
censed at It than his burghers.
Oom Paul enjoys repartee and always
has a Roland for your Oliver. It was at
the wedding of his Kraiuldaurhter that
he gave his now famous bon mot as to
tho color of the Britlah flag. On* of his
younger grandchildren put the question.
"What color Is the British flag?"
"I have only seen white ones!" made
answer Oozn Paul.
He afterward repeated this In public
and It Is now perhaps the must quoted of
his terse sayings.
I don't think I ever saw On m Paul as
Jovial and happy as at this v.eddlng of
Tina Elof, his eldest gronddauÃhter. He
was very much pleased with the choice
of husband*â a gallant young Orange Free
State Boer.
Tina's trousseau was as elaborate as the
wealthy American girl's. Oom Paul hu
moring his favorite In her lov. of finery.
Another wedding gift from her grand
father was a house furnished Just us she
desired.
I recall particularly- the number of beau
tiful "lamas" which Tant Zina. Oom
Paul's wife, gave- her grandchild for a
wedding gift. The "lama" Is the scarf
which the Madagascar maiden* weave of
â Uk and wear Instead of our convention*!

One of th* "lamas" !n oar family la ef

Madagascar girls to make their wedding

was unfaithful and poisoned herself.
Quren Ranavalona ordered another of
her handmaidens to finish It. but the girl
tried In vain to discover the secret of
Karonna's weave and so had to finish It lm
another pattern.
Queen Hanavalona presented th'Â« "la

iled. Tina Klof aÂ«kÂ»-.i him for It to add tÂ»
her collection and he perforce gave It tÂ»

I felt that the "lama" belonged â¢-Â» me.

had mÂ»*t the unfortunate weaver and had
been deeply interested In hrr romance,

valuable than It could po^ibly be to her.
Just before I Wt r>r America the sub

consists almost entirely of magnetite.
Bornholm's magnetic Influence Is not

"Why did i take up the movement? Not
â¢raufre of what I paw. at first, but be
<tu*o of what I endured. I was aiways
Hi treated. In Austria, in Germany, In
Anv-riea. It has been tight, tight all my
life, and so the conditions of society must
be wrong. I was abused by my master,
by my stepmother, by my employer, r.nd

course "of history have been class contests.
The name was different in each case, but
the principle was always the same. An
archy against archy.
"Militarism, priestcraft and the like
mutual friends of governmentallsm are
superfluities In a free society. The man
of the future will throw off these. He will
know less drudgery ami he will enjoy in
creased refinement of the pleasures of
life."
Ho teaches refinement of pleasures,
notice.
He rambled back to his prison life once
more. "I have been always thrown Into
prison." he reiterated. "And what for?
What are Jails for? They are an inven
tion of the social monster. The Jailbird,
as made and found to-day, would appear
'to coming society as an attraction Jit for
the zoo.
"Education is largely at fault. What
freedom of thought Is the child of to-day
allowed? He is made a puppet, his mind
Is crushed. The schools are barracks for
little children, in than they are taught
rigmarole, they pledge to a flag in parrot
like Imitation, they move through mean
ingless exercises which are called the ex
pression of patriotism. This kind of
school life must be done away with."
The words began to flow more slowly.
Somebody in our group waked him with
the question:
"What. are the salient points of your
doctrine, summed up, you know?"
The old man fumbled, thlck-fingercd.
through a pamphlet that lay on the bare
table.
"Read here." he said, pointing, and I
read : '
"In anarchist society, government has
neither place nor purpose.
"The community as a political body is
also superfluous.
"All of man's wants are met by asso
ciations or groups.
"These are no longer centralized and
are only co-operative with one another as
is necessary for the end sought.
"Private property in land and capital
is no more.
"All means of production are under the
control of these various trade organiza
tions. -
" 'Honest dickering' and Its coadjutor,
money, as known to-day, have been re
moved.
"Art and science, like production, are
advanced through the adjustment of com
petent minds.
"Mans mind, thus ever expanding, dis
cards superstition; religion, old and new,
has forever passed away.
"Instead of legislation there Is the de
cision from one case to the next. None
are governed; all are members of numer
ous corporations, which one joins accord
ing to his own judgment, and none need
act against his Inclination.
"Remember, this is anarchy!"
The assembled three listened. When I
wound up with the exclamation point HÂ«Â»rr
Most glanced up quickly for an Instant
to make sure that they were all listening.
For the second It occurred to me that he
might be watching for effects, after all.
Then the glance fell again and his stubby
nailed hands dropped limply on his knees
A forgotten cigar smoldered between his
fingers and went out.
"What do you think about women?" I
started In again.
"As I tell you. I had troubles. I do not
like to go Into the woman question."
He is evidently not In the habit of being
Interviewed by a woman and he chafed
slightly under the operation. He turned
suddenly to the newspaper man and
sawed him, as he spoke, with dirty hands
that fawned for sympathy. "Those
women mÂ«dÂ© my life a misery." he
whined. "They fought, fought, fought
me all the time."
"Hut It should not h* so." he resumed
In his tOM of Instruction. "Th*Â» woman
of th. future will have, a different life
from the woman of the present, and iÂ»o
Bhe will be a different creature. ShÂ« will
r.o longer be â  mere housewife, but sl.e
will enter nil Rcldt which arÂ» open to
man, and she will be Me companion In
art and science and labor. She will not
need to marry that she may bo supported.
There will'ln the happy future be no un
fortunate marriages."
He waited, perhaps for remarks, but
none were made.
"What about your work In California?
Will you be here long?" was asked.
"That 1 do not know. Others arrange
for me."
"What do you think of the California
people in relation to the movement?"
"There HI good material here. The peo
pie are wore ready for new Ideas than
In the Bast; th. are more radical. They
learn and think quickly."
"Have you already many followers
around herÂ»
"Oh. many. many. They are In the
towns of California and up and down the
roast. There are Italians, French and
Germans as well as Americans who be
long to th- movement. I am going north
after a while to â pea* In Portland and
Seattle, where many are Interested."
The questions were no longer forthcom
ing, and I murmur. the "Well" pre
liminary to departure. As I groped for a
Cloak hook at the throat It occurred to
me that ire had heard more destructive
than constructive theory.
"I see that the world hi entirely
wicked." I said. "Now what Is your plan
of reform?"
"We Â«hall form a trust against trusts,"
he replied.

say that I talk of what I know. I have
not come to a hasty conclusion. But I
have looked over my life, and I see that
society has wronged me. I know, for It
has been one long tight through my 53
years: light. 1 say. fight! With my
master, when 1 was a boy apprentice In
Austria; with my employer later, with
my stepmother, the police, and three
wives!"
He lifted Ml eyes and drove them Into
mine, and for the Instant I thought I
knew how one feels when he looks Into
the. face of a cat-beast about to spring.
I shifted my eyes, but his followed. Then
again the spark died, the glance fell, the
words drifted Into a haziness of rebellious
muttering!'. The bloated red face framed
with scrubby white growth dropped. A
smear)', shapeless hat almost hid it. The
picture was sordid.
He roused to bid us good night. Be
yond the family door with its Jangling
bell the four of us drew breath. It was *
good, clean breath laden with thÂ» "ting
of a winter night and the sniff of Christ

"Impressions?" queried the newspaper
man.
"One Hide of his face is out of draw
ing." said the artist.
"Dramatic clement not there." said the
actor. "They say that in his public
speeches he throws off his coat and cries
that he Is ready to lead a fight.

"Then you are no artist." exclaimed

He pulled out two cigars and Inadvert

When It did not accept he threw th<- cigar
away Into the underbrush, for his i ode
of etiquette would not permit him to re
turn It to his pocket. Just then the volet

he Jumped up murmuring. "Had I almost

Vladimir de Pachmann is coming to
play us much music, above all the music
of Weber. Weber Is a god. he says, and
this fart is not known. The pianist will
teach Ã¼b. He will play the sonata in A

yearnings which have never occurred tv
us before.
Do not be disconcerted If he should stop
in the middle of the sonata and bang his
dainty little, naughty bands down on the
keys and Â«ay that he won't play any
more, so there. He. now and again does
such things, but it is his mood: and when
he does play all his Idiosyncrasies seem

In spite <>{ his eccentricities Qerome is
popular among the artists, as whs well
proven on a recent Sunday at Chaotllljr.
The occasion was a sort of double apothe
osis of Gerome and the Due d'Aumale. la
Which the I lightest stars of thÂ«? artistic
world participated, Benjamin Constant,
Carolui Duran and Bougaurrean are only
a few of the illustrious artists who took '
advantage of the occasion to do honor to
(.Jerome. Had an accident of a fatal
nature happened to the Parls-rhantiily
train on this particular Sunday morning,
not only art but literature and society
would have been plunged into â  dreary
darkness, deprived at once of their most
resplendent stars. Among the friends of
Geronie were several members of th^
Academy and other distinguished writers,
while the friends of the Due <l'AumalÂ«
naturally represented the aristocracy of
France. The combination of these two in
dividualities brought to (.'handily a
gathering that It would be hard to sur
pass in brilliancy.
The personality of celebrities is often
disappointing, but that of Qerome is emi
nently satisfactory. Ills Features are

In Ms deep black eyes and stately bearing

that a physiognomist would accord to
him more nf the Michael -Angelo tem
peramentâto execute great outlines and
to let the detail take care of itself.
The making of this statue by Gerome
was in some measure a labor of love. He
knew the Doc d'Aumale, and. like every
other Frenchman, he loved him well. I
doubt that there is a character In the re
cent history of , the French republic
whose memory is more sincerely respect
ed than that of the son of Louis Philippe.
Aristocrat and plebeian have joined
hands concerning him, and justly, tor
the Due d'Aumale was In every sense a
patriotâ he loved his country for his coun
try's sake. The descendant of Kings, the
republic was nevertheless as dear to him
as the monarchy had been. With him
France was always France, no matter
what form of government existed. In 1543
be was Governor of Algeria, adored by
the population and the army, when the
news reached him of the revolution in
France and of the downfall of his father
from the throne." One word, one gesture
from him and 40.000 men would have be
gun a march to Paris. With him at the
head it is said this number could easily
have been doubled between Toulon and
the capital. He knew all of this as well
as any one. He knew that the fate of
the revolution was in his hands. From ail
sides he was urged to take this measure,
but the good of France was superior to
all personal consideration, to all personal
ambition. He weighed the matter wall,
and this is the famous message that he
sent to the provislonary government
â â¢No matter what happens, the devotion
of the African army and of Its officers
to France will remain unalterable. . We
will uphold the national tag regardless of
what chief may be chosen to command
it.' â¢ ;'-!<'r
Twenty-two years later, when on the
â Ith of September the imperial throne was
reversed, the Due d'Aumale presented
himself at Paris. He did' not come as an
aspirant to the throne, but solely to offer
to his country the service of his sword.
But the Government saw In his presence
a new menace. In vain he declared his
willingness to France -under- a re
publican government. His anricai
declined and he was forced to leave thÂ»>
country. Here again thÂ«> Due d'Aumnlfi
â bowed an Inborn greatness; he 1
Tils head in obedience to the decree of his
country, and although he might have re
sented the' Insult with violence, he de
parted In peace. This was the principle
of his patriotism: "A man has never the.
right to plunge his country Into war or
strife, to sacrifice the lives of his com
patriots to avenge a personal Insult."
Throughout his whole career ho was loyal
and patriotic, but never theatrical. Not
In one single Instance did he manifest the
desire to render himself picturesque in
the eyes of posterity. Two years ago he
died, leaving his magnificent possessions
at Chantllly to the State, thus proving
that In spite of many Injustices he nad
no rancor in his hoart against Ills coun
trymen. On the territory that belonged
to him and to hi" ancestors the new
statue from the hand of Gerome now tells
the story of his patriotism.

It Is obtained by the action of nitric acid
on phenol or carbolic acid. It burns very
violently, and. owing to th*Â» tremendous

The Greek and Roman people had ihe

Ilomans dressed them for burial in tl'e

suffered Â«?o many hideous tortures. It is
rupposcd that the custom of burring
dolls with their owners lasted until the
time of Christ. Not much is known about
their making except that thoso of the
1-fO'l'tlans were carved from wood or
rnoided from baked clay, while a bunt!, of

In th- Inland of Java, where brown peo

A French writer tells of the dolls of
East Indlii. They are. odd affairs, but not
haJf so odd as the way they are treated.
Most of the East Indian dolls are in the
form of b woman carrying a baby in her
Â»rms. Fhe Is made of wood and â  block
fastened to her feet makes her able to
stand alone. This is very convenient, for
you know what a bother a floppy doll is
when you want her to stand to recite or
to Ik- married. The worst thing about this
wooden lady la that she cannot move at
all, except at the neck; her head is put on
a prg and can bo turned or removed. Tills
would be advantageous In playing guillo
tine, hut the East Indians never do that.
The writer describes â  wedding proces
sion through the streets of Dacca, which
celebrated the marriage of two dolls.
Children and older people were present,
nnd after the ceremony a feast was given
by the grandparents of the bride. Rich
aiid poor eamo to make merry, and the
host scattered several thousands of ru
pees, the native money, for beggars to
pick up. There was a great scramble,
you may be sure, and such fun for every
body. Music played and people laughed
nnd rhouted and the dolls looked very
happy. You see these little wooden fig
ures are regarded as sacred, and they
are even given a room to themselves In
every house.
"Hina" is the word for "dolls" In
Japan, and each year the Japanese cele
brate what they call the "lima Matsurl,"
or "Feast of Dolls. The hlna are not
broken or torn or allowed to leak saw
dust as, alas, American dolls too often
are. When a girl Is born, her father buys
her two hiaa at a shop, and she must
takÂ»- pood care of these all her life, play-
Ing with them gently while she Is little
and taking th< m to her new home when
she marriÂ»-s and passing them down to
the next generation when she dies.
This seema impossible to us, but the
â  > se are a precise, neat and wo'.l
mannered rare, who could no more play
roughly than their own dolls. So Jt comes
that every family has a great
collection Of hina hunded down from al
most forgotten grandmothers, as well as
the m-w ones that are added now and
then. They are not handled every Say
l>\- nm- means, but laid away on f'irae
bamboo shelf to aw;iit itate occasions.
Tho most important of these occasions
mentioned it occur* in April,
when the poach tree boughs are aa pink
a^- MiÂ«.ks of wintergreen candy. The
peach blossoms are brought into the
house for decoration ami howen Of them
arÂ»- made. All the cousins and aunts are
i. as ours an- at Christmas, and a
tat.!.- of Rood things is spread before
ti.ni. The] are told that they may look
but not taste, because the. f<a.<=t is for
the dolls. All the house's luna are
brought to the table and Invited I
but, poor thiiiÃs, they can't. So tin y si:
up and try not to look bored, but they
never taste a crtunb. After awhile bed
time comca and they and the children are
bundled off to bed, and then what do you
think Uappenai Well, the big people are
loft all alone with the feast and it is very
tempting and so they just eat every apeck
of it dear through dessert.
In these days Prance makes the finest
flolls in tlx' world, but France was taught
la the first place by Italy. In the reign
nf Charles VI an Italian peddler came to
France bringing ninety-six puppetsâ
Images, they were, of Empresses and
noble ladles known throughout Europe.
The maker had obtained coins from va
rious countries and studied the images of
these people which he found stamped on
the coins.
At first he traveled among the French
peasants showing his dolls and earning
a small living In that way. The people
were Interested the odd coilecliou, and

by and by King Charles heard of It In
come roundabout way and Gent for the
peddler to come to his court. Kings have
co many amusements that they arc always
tired of everything and looking about for
something new. When Charles saw thÂ©
exhibition ho was delighted, "and," quoth
he, "I must have a doll of my own at
once." Bo he took one that represented
an especially pretty young lady of the
nobility and tossed the peddler a chink
ing piece of good money. "Hero's a
month's lodging," 'thought thÂ© peddler
Joyfully.
"We must have dolls If the King does,"
whispered the court.
And thereupon ninety-five distinguished
persons bought out the peddler, and he
retired, to live happy ever after. Dolls
became the fashion in France, and their
manufacture began and has Increased
and improved through all these years.

During a recent vacation spent in that
Interesting country I saw none of the

In all the civilized countries of â  the
whole world German and French dolls an;
now found. They are dressed according to
the fashion of the place where they live,
but are nearly all from the same land.
They become naturalized early. Thus, the
doll from Cairo Is as hauÃhty and showily
dressed as are the wealthy people there.
although the doll Itself came from Ger
many. In the same way a doll pent to
Spain grew sober and finally became a de
vout monk.
If you should travel throuph the Ger
man villages you would find women and
children at work In their homes making
pieces of dolls. Some carve the heads and
bodies, others make less and arms, others
lit and sew dresses. -Ml these articles
made In the country are collected by deal
erÃ of the cities, who buy them and have
them put together in factories." But the
beet dolls are made entirely in Rreat fa- -
.torlea â those of wax and hls'iue and
papier macheâ and hundreds of thousands
are turned out each year from one town
alone. The heads are made In many
molds, which have different features and
expressionsâ aa many molds as there
.ire kinds of faces. The dolls are stuffed
with sawdust, if they ara good; hay it

that case the sawdust would Ret into the
crier and stop It. What effect do you
suppose a dose of sawdust would have
upon Annlo when her balloon slips loose,
or upon Johnnie when he cuts his finger?
Perhaps it might stop their criers, too.
morning of our arrival at Victoria we
caught our first glimpe of the marvelous
Bupply of tlmb<>r with which the moun
talna are covered, and for days as we
traveled through the "inside passage"
there was no apparent diminution of these
vast forests.
t >n we wiT.t. up through a magnificent
body of water which had the appearance
of a beautiful river, and again would wid
en out to a bay, with thousands of islands
dotting the BUrf vercold Mother
Nature In her prodigality had seen rit to
place them.
We passed up through the Seymour
Narrows, where the mountains clos,- in on
either Hide, making the channel very' nar
row, through which at a certain time of
the tide tho current runs with such frigUt
ful vcloci-/ that it is impossible for any
steamer tl jaake headway against it .so
the vessel* are compelled to time them
selves in reaching this spot in order that
they may have a safe passage through.
There is a story told that some years
ago a certain United States gunboat
reached these narrows at the dangerous
period of the tide, and when the pilot
In charge hesitated about taking the
passage he was instructed by the captain
that a "United States man-of-war could
go any place" and to "steam ahead, dm
steamed ahead and did go some place, She
went to the bottom, and her bone* are at
present lying there as a result of his fool
hardiness.
In the wider parts of this inland passage
. we encountered M many whales and por
poises playing about the ship that they
coon ceased to attract attention. We were
told that on the trip immediately preced
ing this one the steamer AI-KI. on which
we were-, struck a whale so hard that she
cut half through it and the leviathan
stuck fast to her bow. making it neces
sary for the sailors to go down with axes*
and chop it in two before the boat could
proceed.
A curious feature of the landscape that
presented Itself In steaming through this
great timber country was an appearance
at the water's edge as if the country was
entirely fenced in with an ordinary rail
fence, when we knew there were no fences
within hundreds of miles. Th appeur
ance Is caused by great trees falling into
the water and being buffeted about until,
stripped of their bark by the action ot
the water, they are finally thrown upon
tho beach, where they lie In such pro
fusion bleaching in the sun that they tike
on the appearance of fence rails, and thus
produce the illusion referred to.
The first sight we had of the natives,
except here and there an occasional canoe
slipping along under shelter of the land,
I wan on turning a bend of the stream,
about three days out from the Sound. We
came upon a comfortable looking village
of wooden cottages called Bella Bella. I
counted seventy houses, all properly paint,
ed and comfortable looking, and d'iii.-rn g
only from the white man's town In that
they looked cleaner, while on the outskirts
stood a collection of the ever present to
tem poles.
We at last landed from the steamer at
a funny little semi-circular-shaned Indian
village named Coring, or, as the Indians
call it, Xaha. It is sustained entirely by
the fishing industry, th â  Alaska < ' -mm
cial Company having a large cannery
there. The fish are caught by the natives,
I who appear to be very thrifty and con
tract with the cannery annually to supply
them with fish, while the squaws and chil
dren work In the various packing- 1
The natives are extremely inquisitive,
, and exact the privilege of ransai Icing all
! one's outfit and belongings; but they seem
to be prompted simply by â  childish curi
osity and have a reputation among the
white settlers of being absolutely honest.
1 One Industrious native has a large saw
; mill near Lorlng. in which he employs
many hands and supplies the prospecting
, villages that are rapidly springing up with
lumber. Another native has a cooper
i shop and is a skilled workman. lie told
I us that he Warned his trad* in the Gov
ernment school at Sltka. In the winter ho
gets out his barrel stun* from the woods,
and spends the summer in iking barrels,
for which he has a contract with the can
nery for all he can furnish at 96 cents
apiece. He told us that hr could maKÂ«
ten barrels a day. which at that rate did
not â¢em altogether bad for an Indian.
Many of the natives can read an write,
having been taught at Bltka, and are
much envied by those who have not he--n
so fortunate. Sitka Is the Mecca of the
Alaskan natives, and from my experience
and conversations had with thÂ»m I wish
to acknowledge the Inestimable work that
Is being done there by the Government.
After inspecting the Loring cannery we
were proffered the use of a small boat
with which to pay a visit to the "lake."
a body of water a short distance from the
village. Our Instructions were to row up
i an arm of the sea until we came to a cer
tain waterfall, make the boat fast and
walk around and above the fall, where
we would lind another boat. In which
we could continue our trip. We did as
I directed, and upon turning a bend In thÂ»
stream came upon the beautiful plrture of
' a sheet of water about a hundred feet
wide pouring over a preclnlro ahout flf

moored to the bank and finding the other
boat as directed, we rowed to an Island
near th* midle of the lake where wo

thereon lmonberrl< - huck'.oberrlea and
the largest and most luscious blackborrtÂ»s

picture <if extreme beiiMtiveness, liory ii>

feem to promise hapjiinr-ss in the married
Mate. Yrt otic cannot fail to perceive in

have cured. Her own testimony is to the
rffect that a woman's place of honor and
hEppiness is at home with a lovinc hus
band an<l a family of children, and that
her work was dene for a living.
Miai Whltins'* biography affords the
material? for a complete view of Kate
FieM's own nature. Her lonely and too
excited childhood, her youthful overseri
ousness, her vronderfol education in the
rociety that RathereÂ«l about the Brown

know fully all that Kate Field was and
C â  I
It If. however, or.ly as a collection of
materials that Miss Whiting** book is to
be commended. It is a work of ridiculous
prolixity. On one pago we are given the
full text of a letter communicating a vote
of thanks for t-nmcthing Mips Field had
writtenâ a gentlemanly letter, but as
characterless and tririal. now its day has
passc-i. as every such letter must he. On
another stands the list of artists who
exhibited at an art congress organized by
her; on another the reader receives the
information that "Miss Field's efforts con
tributed greatly t* influencing public sen
timent in favor of this mode of disposing
of the dead" (cremation), and that
"among other able advocates of cremation
arc Rtv. R. U<bor Newton. D.D.. of New
York; Professor Charles Eliot Norton and
Hon. Charks Francis Adams." It is la
formal letters and useless lists of names
that Miss Whiting most delights. In a
book of a third as large as hrrs might l>c
told and better told all that is of import
ance about Kate Field and about the re
lations between her and the rest of the
world. If it were necessary to increase
the Mze of the biography copious quota
tions from Kate Field's own writings
would have been more acceptable than
Miss Whiting's tedious letters and society
column lists of nann-s. Perhaps Miss
Whiting belie\ed that it was necessary to
bolster up Kate Field's claims to import
ance, by proof of her wide acquaintance
w:th important people. Certainly Kate
Fit Id's talents and career were in them
selves punViently unusual to Justify the
existence Â«>f a biography.
The flatness of Miss Whiting's own com
ments and her reprehensible habit of
quoting moral poetry in older to apply it
:o the facts of Miss Field's life still fur
ther weaken what they cannot destroyâ
the vivid Impresyion of Kate Field's na
ture produced by everything she had to
do with. I M Whiting tells us that
money cannot buy everything that it is
not the easiest life huh Is best, that
common pense is not common. She often
enforrcs her remark with a quotation,
usually a good quotation, but in the
meantime "the stage waits."
One oddity of Miss Whiting* book Is the
fact that when she speaks of science it is
th*Â» science of lx>mbroso or "psychical
f-citnee'* that she is thinking of. Premo
nitions, clairvoyance and all thÂ« other
phenomena which lie a little way over
the border of the uncertain have a great
charm for her. Of course, her books deal
ing with these subjects are pretty well

Southern life, may well have been startled
into speaking with Mich extravagance of
these portraits. The best alone Justify
his praise. Several are a little cold and
photographic. The best, however, have
a pathetic charm for which Mr Hards'
words of praise are not too strong. The
versos, regarded as literary compositions,
are worthless. As expressions of feeling
and in a subtle way Interpretations of
the pictures they are very useful, for
the pictures are ho modest and so re
served, Â«is It were, that without a com
mentary they might be obscure. (The

The Century Company has published
four collections of short â¢â :â â¢- "Holly
find Plzen" by Ruth McEnery Stuart,
"The Pour-masted Cat-boat" by â¢ : tries
Battell Loomls, "Little .Tim "row" by
Clara Morris, and "His Defense" by
Harry - Illwell Edwards. All exhibit
workmanlike Ingenuity in turning stories
off quickly and without confusing compli
cations, and all owe much of their inter
est to a certain whimsical extravagance.
Miss Smart's "Holly and Wren" and Mr.
Edwards' "His Defense" .-ire the most im
portant and interesting. in them the fun
comes from the quaintness of situations,
which arise in a perfectly intelligible and
normal way. from th contact of oddly
developed characters. The man who
cussed his mother-in-law and the mother
in-law who kept the machine are odd peo
ple, but the reader can Understand how
they came to be and to do just as they
ii.i. and tan therefore rtnd not mere
oddity but human sympathy In their story.
Likewise the old negro who took the
" 'sponsiblllty" for the ailments of a
whole countryside, and the negress who
arranged to be buried by proxy in order
to impress her friends with her wealth,
are whimsically but nut unnaturally con
ceived, and Ik:. the stories about them.
however funny, have an Interest of. hu
man comedy, which is something more
than the merely comic. Miss Stuart's
tai% also contain many touches of lively
characterization In her treatment of
minor personages and a full conception of
the circumstances in which her plot is
developed, so that her work possesses an
abounding life.
Miss Morris* collection of short stories
have a more apparent touch of sentiment.
Their plots are nearly nil at least partly
tragic, while their characters are in gen
eral comic. They impress the reader as
.studies. The author seems to have writ
ten them up to an Idea and noit from an
inspiration. The characters are few and
l ho attention Is focused usually on a sin
gle one. Little attempt is made to sug
gest circumstance or "atmosphere." The
impression produced is single and definite,
perhaps bare. Most of them are stories
of children's heartsâ of childish hero-wor
â hip, or childish disappointment. Some
are open to the charge of sentimentality,
some of melodrama, hut the best of them

Crow**â fo penetrating in their ob
servation and fo genuine that they at
tain poignant intensity. The situation
where the little girl, unconscious of trage
dy, tears the black streamers from -the
door to make a dress for her dolly, is one
of extraordinary power and pathos.
Mr. Loomls' book was written to make
fun. He says of It: "It hasn't bothered
me to write it. I hope it won't bother
you to read it. for I'd hate to have you
bothered on my account." % The best
parts of it are the burlesques of current
literary typesâ the dialect story and the
sea story for instance. His own inven
tions are usually a little thin. But nothing
in its kind could be more perfect than
this:
"The sea lay low in the ofllng. and. as
far as the eye could reach, immense white
caps rode upon it as quietly as pond-lilies
on the bosom of a lake.
"Fleecy clouds dotted the sky. and far
off toward tho horizon a full-rigged four
masted cat-boat lugged and luff, in the
evening breeds. Her Kails were piped to
larboard, starboard, and port, and, as she
rolled steadily along in the heavy wash
and undertow, her companion-light, al
ready kindled, shed a delicate ray across
the bay to where â¢ ... dull red disk of the
sun was dipping his colors."
Equally witty is the notion of buying
dialvct over the counter. "If ye're want
in' some a wee bit shop-worn, I'll let ye
hae that at a lower price. There's a
quantity that lan Maclaren left oot o*
his last buke." 1 expressed surprise that
he had let any escape him, and he said:

Some Homely
Little Songs
A book of verses by A. J. "tt'aterhouse
has Just been published under- the title
of "Some Homely Little bongs. " It will
certainly find a most welcome place
among all lovers of good â¢ whole-soul
poesy, for Mr. Waterhouse is a writer
Who makes words subservient to the idea
and paints his pictures with thÂ« greatest
delicacy and without effort. There is no
straining for literary effects, firework em
bellishments of great words and Involved
figures of speech. The style Is direct,
simple, and the thoughts conveyed strike
the sweetest chords on the human heart
strings. The title, "Homely Little Songs,"
is certainly most aptly chosen. The
wholesome sentiments of the book
throughout would seem to show that Its
author had been actuated by the thought
expressed in the first line of his poem,
"As I Would Believe:"
1 want to keep thinking that God's as true.
And the grays as green and the Fkies as blue.
A.Â« they v-".i to be when my life was jroaac
And the bird of th- morn to my pint "stuns;
I want to look out through my time-dimmed
eyes
To the ihJpa of mlst In the seas of skier,
And fe"l that th.- hand that guides them there
Win utill fur my faltering footsteps care.
For beautiful word-paintinc it would be
hard to find lines more sympathetically
artistic than the following on "How the
Flowers Grow":
Do you know, darling , how pansies crow?
God takfs the tints of the bunset glow.
The purple that floats in the mountain mist.
The blush of a maid by her love first kissed.
The blue that's aaleep In the midday skies
The brown that I love In my baby's eyes.
And He mingles them all in a flower: and so
That is the way that the pansies grow.
Do you know, darling, how lilies (trow?
God takes the soul of the beautiful snow
And molds It Into a chalice iml
Pure and wonderful, fair, complete:
Then he takes the gold of my baby's hair
And sets it amid the whiteness there.
As in night's white skies the bright stars glow
And that is the way that the lilies grow.
Po you know, darling, how roses grow?
Ah, that Is the strangest of all. I know;
For they are the fairest of all thing* fair.
The one perfect blossom, beyond com Dare:
Symbol of .sweetness and all loveliness â
God wished His children to comfort and bless.
And He wrote the thought in a flower; and so.
That is the way that the roses crow.
Here are verses that have the true
Christmas ring and jingle; moreover, they
are so strictly and refreshingly <"alifor
nlan. In fact, the book throughout is
filled with the healthy atmosphere of the
West and teeming with the piquant indi
viduality of its author:
Hey, there, little *trlÃ. who live In the Wtit,

The poem of patriotic bravery and death
is as old as the hills, and It Is a delicate
undertaking for almost any writer to
brinpr it to successful Issue. The follow
ing on "Bunner of 'Frisco" proves Mr.
Waterhouse fully equal to the occasion,
however. The humorous little touch In
the last verse makes the poem aim:
Bunner of 'Friscoâ knew him well:
Queer little chap as ever you mrt;
Always lnsiitln' that war. was hellâ
"Regular Hades it I*, you bet."

which was tho seen* of many Ions;.

dead, forgotten or well to the front la

Many, varied and contradictory are th*
accounts to bo gathered of the origin anl
dates of successive managemer.is and en
gagements connected with the old thea
ter.
ThÂ« Bush-street Theater, -..--.
called fIM Alhamhrn. was built on this
ride of tin- middle sixties, and was fir*:
under the management of William Smith,
who subsequently became th*> manager
Of the Standard in St. Louis. The "per.

the picture on his return to thÂ« seen* of
his former triumphs, broken by ill-luck
nnd facing fresh reverses. Just here on<Â»
might recall the old-time rtama of the
theater, being a "hoodoo." singularly
carried out In the later fortunes of its
former managers, not one of whom pos
sesses to-day a dollar made within lta
walls.
C. K. Locke here Inaugurated his fam
ous "gift show." a slMght-of-hani feat
ure being tho golden thread upon which
was strung the- dazzling temptations of
"gifts." Incredibly expensive and as al
luring In their way as lottery tickets
were those "gifts." represented by j mirh

niviil Qunrd." made up of young la'llos
drilled strictly a la rullitalrr. and who
distinguished themselves by receiving
General Grant, then on a visit to the city.
Locko always distinguished himself by
"blg ># things. This "carnival" was thÂ©
biggest thing e\tr known hrre up to â¢ -at
dato. as also was the "gift" show. After
this ho settled down to a long and pros
perous run at tho Bush. refuting it, es
pecially the boxes, which were done In
pretty Japanese effect. Ho was very lib

ing carte blanche at the box offlco to
those whom he liked. Alice Gates opened

ono. for the was then at her zenithâ
charmingly bright and vivacious. For
nlno weeks the box office turned people
away, While Alice danced on the hearts
of the crowded spectators inside.
"She wed to wear such wickedly fas
cinating little boots with tassels." said
an old-timer. "Ah." with a sigh, "they
don't rnako such boots nowadays."
In tho Oates engagement Pauline Hall
and her sister made their debut In the
chorus. Afterward Kmlllo Melville held
the boards for'repeatcd triumphs. singing
in "Patience." "Robinson Crusoe." and
Christmas week. "Cinderella."
Then came Kate Castleton. with her
absurdly popular ditty of "For Goodness
Sake," etc. The following stars appeared
under this regime:
Xaje Salisbury, J. K. Emmett (Mrs. M.

safely hazarded that she has never since
received a more enthusiastic, thunderous
round of applause than then greeted her.
Over at the Baldwin Theater ahÂ© had

Celebrated Case."
Vlck Roberts' "Humpty Dumpty" was
staged where while James Uerne was
stage manager. Herne, well known as a
prodigious practical Joker, exploited his
talent on tho bartender below stairs,
where iii those days a saloon formed the
enly approach to the stage Dark and
gloomy was this underground passage,
but it bounteously set forth the actor's
dream in the shape of a hot 15 cent lunch.
A stage-bomb, harmless enough in Its re

of "Humpty Dumpty." but Herne con

in perpetuity. Since that time !t has b<-en

the Jesuit church; of which the Holy
Father Is the head, ha* preserved this
ceremony nr.d It Is now carried out to the
utmost detail In all of the Jesuit churches
cf tl.e â world.
The h"ly year begins with thÂ« first ve?
p*rs of the feast of Christmas, which Is
f.rcd at the meridian of tho day preceding
Christmas, or what we commonly call
Christinas evÂ«\ and < very Jesuit church In

certain, but that he entered there on
Palm Sunday is absolutely untenable. Not
one of the many pilgrims befor* anÂ«l after
the crusade? mentions th'.s as the gate
through which Chris: entered Jerusalem;
Only of late has this Idea been suggested.
The Golden Gate J3 to bÂ«* found In the
eastern wall of the present haram. or
court of the Mosque of Aksa. The lower
portion belongs to the period of the tem
pi*, whil* the upper part is Hyzantlne.
The top is Moslem. This. gate was made
ir.to a fortified tower. Like the other
temple gates It had a double entrance. It
has been built up by a wall for a long
time.
From time ImmemortÃl haÂ« this been
considered the one through which Jesus
entered and passed to the temple. Jeans
came from Bethany, whence 'here are
threÂ© paths to Jerusalem. The southern
most, the modern highroad, passes over
the lower ridge between the Mount of
<"â¢ffen.se and the Mount of Olives proper.
This Is the longest route. The second, the
middle path, leads directly over the sum
mit of the Mount of Olives, and then
southerly. The third and northernmost
path also parses over th<* heights. All
three pass by the present Garden of Getli
uemarie, and there run Into a single road.
The valley of the Kldron Is then traversed
by a bridge.
Now. according to Luke. "Jesus de
scended the Mount of Olives,*' which could
apply to the, northernmost or to the mid
dle road, and besides. "He saw the city
aad wept over It." which points to the
middle path. By the southern road littlo
could be s<en of the city, but .ill the. ex
tensive temnle bulldincs were visible.
coor, seizes a silver mace, raises it over
hi* head, strike-* ilie door thn times nt'J
Immediately from the other pl<le it is de
molished.
It Is not taken from Its hlnpcs: the lock
Is not broK<n; the door^snarbkeri^down;
there Is an aperture made and if this
aperture is lance enough to permit his
Hollnrs? to pass through he turn and
salutes his consorts, who full upon their
knees; then be l<-;ids tiie way through the
embrasure Into the cathedrals interior.
Immediately after the procession ha*
r<.i!Â»- l<oyond the door, or rather passed
ihrouKh the aperture which has been
made "by violence." the Pope returns and
with a silver trowel casts some lime upon
the Boor and then selecting three stones
which have been placed ready at his hand,
puts them in position, blesses the door*
the trowel, the lime and the stones, re-
Hssumes the head of the procession and
passes on. Immediately the door is re
sealed to await the coming of another
"Year of Jubilee," which is intended to
occur each twenty-flve years only.
The PopÂ« now proceeds to the altar,
where as the most devout penitent he
pets upon his knees. In the meantime
the dean of the College of Cardinals, fol
lowed by a retinue of prelates, parses on
through St. Peter's . and approaches thÂ«
holy door of the Basilica of St. Paul's,
and there, representing the Pope, per
forms the lame ceremony. After these
tn*Â» cÂ«remonteÂ« are performed the Car
And. too., it must b<Â» remembered that
the path pursued by J.^sus did not lie far
from liethphage, which was on the east
ern declivity of the Mount of Ollv. 3. so
It was impossible for Jesus to have taken
the southern path. And it If Just as cer
tain that Jesus d!d go by the middle path
which jpassi directly over the ridge of
the Mount of Olive?.
As you come down from the mountain
you are directly In front of the Golden
Gate. This wculd have been the case na
matter by which path he had come from
Bethany. It was the nearest gate of the
city and Its threshold was only about
100 feet above the road along the gar-iÂ«Â»n
of Gethsemane and the bridge, and but
725 feet away In an air line. Here, too.
the valley was at Its widest; here the
valley running from the northern side of
the city opened into the valley of Ki<"
ron, broadening the wnole valley. As a
result of this the path had to run along
a curved line.
Now the Golden Gate Is in the temple
wall, but at that time the city wall was
from 50 to C 5 feet outside of the wall of
the temple. Necessarily there must have
been .i gate In the city wall at this point,
but it was not a double, only a single
gate, like all the other city gates. After
Jesus had ridden through this gate and
approached, the temple pate, he had to
pot down from the ass; nor would he
have beer, permitted to ride through the
liulda sate. This caused a slight delay,
â¢ luring which the accompanying multitude
crowded together, increased also by
others, especially children, who came out
of the neighboring houses that were built
between the two walls.
The rest of the city now heard the loud
mnaia piki priests retire to their ro.anoi'
tlvi basilicas and there perform the *itme
ceremony In private; that Is. they demol
ish and pas through a holy door of their
own. to their particular apartments. Alt
erward for a whole year these doors are
scaled and Impassable t<> all pilgrims anf*
all penitents. It Is only at the "Feast of
the Nativity" when a penitent may po*s
through, and then only with the blessing
and upon hi.- knees.
Accompanying the Holy Father and Im
mediately behind him Is the high peni
tentiary, who recta whatever shall be
done, who stands between the Pope and
the throng of people who are present to
witness th" ceremony.
It is particularly Interesting to know
that the churches of the Jesuit fathers
throughout 'â¢''â¢ United States have pre
served this custom with rigid directness,
and also that It has been made an annual
observance. "The Year of Jubilee," which
occurs every twenty-five years, at the
meridian of the, 2Uh day of December, is
with them an epoch. On such occasion*
a programme Is prepared, arrange
ments are made, and the peni
tents of the church are
bidden to be present
at the ceremony;
and it Is a

cries of HcjsuTina; the people came to see
what It waÂ« all about an went into the
temple v.ith . i runs, This Is a reasona
ble and natural account of the ocour
rt-nce.
Hut if, on tli"i other hand, It ' - supposed
that Jesus entered by the 1 1 till!:; Bate.,
everything becomes unnatural and forced.
Even here the Kldrun Valley had to lvÂ»
crossed. But It wan certainly easier there,
where It was not no deep, M lower down
whore it wav not only deeper but also
narrower and steeper. Sepp admits that
Jesus went by the southerly path but did
not ko an far as the Garden of Geth
semane, but turned off westward Into the
valley to shorten the route. A northerly
short cut would have led by the so-called
tomb of Absalom into thÂ« valley to the
lower bride* But this road is very steep,
much steeper than that which led to the
Golden Gate. In fact, In order to ride
to the western suburb comfortably on the
aÂ«s. so as to pass through Ophe', the
route had to be followed further In the
valley, as far as the Pool of Siloom. and
then an ascent of three hundred feet to
the threshold of the Hulda Gate had to
be rr.ado. Resides the road to the Golden
Gate was only one-fifth as lons as that
to the other gate..
Therefore there can be no doubt that
Jesus entered 1- the eastern Kate. All
subsequent historical notice â¢ agree with
this idea.
That this eastern crate whs partially de
stroyed by the Romans Is proved by the
discovery of the ruins of the lower sec
tlon. It is possible that thin sate was
partially restored by Hadrian In the sec
ond century, but not probable. This em
peror's architectural achievements were
most solemn occasion. A procession Is
former! which is presided over by the
Archbishop, who has already delegated
â¢ n<- of the fathers to represent the
J'ope. Behind him are the priests and
lesser dlÃnltarU'H of the church and -
church and following them Is the
multitude of penitents. In the ut
most Plli-nce and with bowed heads
thÂ«>y await the demolition of thÂ«
door.
No one. not even the Arch
bishop, raises his head at this
time. Particles of the refuse
are, however, seized by each
person In paasins and de
voutly preserved. The cere
mony Is conducted In abso
lute silence and Is the moat
solemn occasion of the
Catholic year, as
well as one of
the most Im
pressive of

KAISER'S VISIT TO JERUSALEM)
chiefly In the: rfty, not In the temple. The
real restoration of these gates only took
place later.
Th* l!ul<!a Gate wan rebuilt by Justin
lan In the sixth century, as we know from
an Inscription on a stone, used for It. The
gateway formed the foundation for his
Church of St. Mary. As to.t he Golden
Gate, In the year GG2. when Justinian died,
it had not been restored, for a little later,
between 570 and 100, Antonius Martyr saw
It still In ruins. He says: "From Geth-
Bemane we anconded many steps to the
gate of Jerusalem. This ga.te Is connected
with th.it once beautiful gate of the tem
ple, whose threshold and posts still stand."
Here we have mention of two separate
Rates; first the city {fate, of course, In the
city wall, and near It, but somewhat re
moved, were the ruins of the former tem
ple gate, which had been part of the tem
ple wall. The steps that he mentions are
those which had Keen long used by 'cot
travelers, leading directly from the valley
up to the pate from the south of the Oar
den of Gethsemane. This has nothing to
do with the path by which Jesus mad*
hie festal entrance into the temple.
A little later the Persians, under ChoÂ«
roes, captured the city and destroyed
many buildings, especially churches,
among which wore those that had been
In the valley of Jehoiaphat (Kldron Val
ley). The eastern sate was Included in
this destruction. The Christian Em
poror Herarlius besieged the Per
sians and t\tered Jerusalem In 625
with th*
holy
cross,
which
had recovered. lie came In through'
this eastern pate. I think that Her
acllus, who wanted to rebuild (mm"

who undertook the reconstruction
of the Golden Gate on Its ancient
foundations, but according to a
new Byzantine plan. In this way
way It became a monument of
lilb victorious entry Into Jeru
salem and the bringing back of
the holy cross and at thÂ« same
time a reminder of the for

Baedeker assigns the re
building to the seventh oen

HOW TO SET THE CHRISTMAS DINNER
Ccr>nsl:tfd. JSÂ».
CHRISTMAS is peculiarly the season*
of entertaining and feasting. Pre
parations for Christmas joys and
pU .isurcs occupy the hearts and
nlr.fls of a vast majority of the people at
this feMlve reason, and as fresh as on the
rr.ornlrg of the birth of Him who was the
great founder and king of Christmas Is
the Christmas spirit that fills our hourts
â¢with the Christmas carols to which our
voices give utterance.
To the busy housÂ» keeper Christmas !s
n time not only of Joy but somewhat of
raro and ar.xicty *â¢ well, fvr upon her
preparations for the gnat event of the
<*.ayâ :?"â¢ Onistmas dinnerâ depends a
great deal of the Christmas rnjoyim-ut.
r.r.t only of the members of hÂ«*r house
hold but of the Kurs.s who ore bidden to
n'.t at her hospitable board on the king of
Â«*a>>. I haw thought it possible that I
:n!(C^t be cf some service to some of thesa
busy housewives at this busy season by
Kivlng them a few hints with regard to
the way In which they may make their
Christmas dinner tuble wear it most
pleasing and nttrartlvo Rarb, and llnd
the KTCatest amount of favor In the sight
of those Who gather around it. It Is
really remarkable how few people know
how to set a tuble to the best advantage,
und how to pnsent B'Â»od dishes and rare
wines In the manner which shall best dis
play their most meritorious qualities.
Among those epicureans who have m.i'.Â»
a study of the great art of dinner givln-;â
JÂ«r no matter what any one else may tell
you the riving of dinners deserves to rank
lis a ilr.u artâ there Is a wide difference of
opinion bs to how a perfect dinner may
be achieved. It goes without saying that
J>r!ght F:lver. dainty china, spotless linen
and a handsome table are sine qua. nons.
A good dinner thus served with genial
company is n delight. To give an elegant
ChriMmas dinner first lÂ«-arn how to set
me table. A round tab!<Â« is always pref
erable to a square one. because It brings
guests Into closer and more lnt'mate re
latic.i.ship with each other. It was be
cause they *nt at a round table and thus
}-.Md their intellects so stimulated by com
jng Into such close contact with each
other that King Arthur and his Knights
of the round ta'>le were the epitome, of
the wit and wisdom or that day. If.
however, pour room Is too small to admit
of a round table, then you will have to be
tatlsfkd with the ordinary oblong one of
the. familiar "extension" pattern, so com
mon lo every household. It Is true, that
thÂ«TÂ«* nre some women in New York so
ciety who decline to abandon the old
fashioned, long, narrow table Cor one of
the round type, but most cÂ»f these have
porae. special reason for clinging to the
old style table. In the Asior family th<-re
Is a gold dinner FÂ«*t which is best dis
played on the old-f.shioncd. long, narrow
ta.h!o, and then fore, if you dine with MrÂ«.
Astor t-he will set you down to a tnbio of
that kind. AÂ«i oblong table has the call
!n the Holmont household, and t!Â»e dinner
<lponr:j.tions me of Â«.u<h a character as to
ever, more strongly mark its form.
I^ct me mv. Jirt-t of all. that flowers
are an Jndzsocnsable accompaniment of
ovcry good ditun r. No matter how poor
the room or h'.w humble the board In
which and on which the meal Is served;
no matter how coarse the viands or how
poorly cooked or Indifferently served: no
matter whether In tho humble home of iÂ»ie
mechanic OX tho stately palace of the ml
iioraire, flowers add a zest and an .ip
pftairg quality lo th" mÂ«al that nothing
â¦â lsÂ« can give. The bunch of wild (lowers
on the liuaM* table Jn the hut of tne
poorest peasant are. ns beautiful and as
appropriate as th<- rarest orchids on the
Corff'ous table <'f tho man of wealth.
For the flowers and for your guests islso
df> rot have thf Christmas dining-room
100 3iot. Better a trifle cool than a decree
ton werm. First place a thiÂ«-k flannel
cloOi on your table to deaden the sound of

white damask. Let this bear your family
crest or coat of arms. A beautiful effect

To the left o.* earn plate place two
dinner forks and an oyster fork, whose

plate. Place a dinner knife and a soup

should also lwÂ» sirranged. Next to the
plate, is the water glat-s. the glasses for
otlvr drinkables coining n<*\t. A dinner
bread roll is Inclosed In tho cover fold of
the largo damat-k napkin which bears the
monogram of the dinner-giver. When
taken from the napkin the roll should bÂ«

Olives and salted almonds, to bo served

Fold. Fine embroidered doilies are placed

of course the plates nro changed after
roup and with each coun>2. If you are
poljijj to have servants to wait at your
Â«'hristmas dinner tahle, remember that
two men cannot proprriy wait upon more
thati eight or ten. and that for more than
twelve and up to sixteen or eighteen there
rhould be at least four.
With the old-time table of polished ma
hogajiy or oak the cloth was removed be
fore the bringing on of the fruits and
r.iffÂ«-#>. which were served on the bare,
table. This Is never done now. Through
cut the entire dlnnrr the same cloth re
znaina upon the beard. It is essential to
the Christmas dinner that servants should
be well trained anil obey every order of
the butler. A master or mistress must
never speak to a servant during dinner,
and the servant! must be as silent as
Trapplsts, wearing light shoes that cannot
creak, and if they have a napkin instead
of gloves their hands must be perfectly
clean. They should have their "beats"
like policemen, one beginning at the
guest nt his master's right. If there are
only two servants, at.d ending with the
lady of the house; the other should bt gin
with the guest on the right of his mis
tress and end with the master.
The lighting for the Christmas dinner Is.
a very Important consideration. I.igM Is
positively necÂ«<*ury to Â«!iKÂ«Mion. and no
party can be <ln-erful althout it. It is
difficult to have 100 much light, bin th*
lights mur; be carefully arranjc-li for a
mere glare becomes painful. The great
object is to threw as much light as pos
sible on the tablo and .lust enough on the
faces of the guests. Lighting â¢' Til t.H'
walla Is apt to throw the Ijttor into the
s!::i<v. and a chandelier in tr.c middle
must be hung very low to do iu<t!co to
llie former. The dining-room must be. of
course, carpeted <". â¢ n In the heat of sum
mer, no matter how handsome or orna
mental the lloor. to dvaden the sound of
the servants' feet.
And now, tiar!ng told you how to pet
the Christmas dinner table, the Â«?rcat
question arises. Whom shail you |:iv!te to
tat Christinas dinner with you? The chief
l>olnt is to Invite men and womenâ an
equal number of both, of coarseâ who can
talk. 1 â ;. th'.s I do not moan your rapid
ut'erers of small talk, who can coin more
pretty nonsense In half an hour than your
modern novelist in a month, but nun v. ho,

their Pegasus with the curb of experience,

the newspapers supply, to wit. men who

women who are capable of un

Carving can be made a line art by any
one who takes some pains to quire it.
It needs, in the. first place, â  little
knowledge of the anatomy of the bird
or section of the animal served up.
A saddle of mutton should be ( arved In
long slices, half lean, half fat. A cut
should be made down the whole length
parallel w.ith the backbone, and slices cut
diagonally lrom the center of the back
to the end ot the rib*.
A shoulder of mutton Is as easy to
manipulate, once the right side to cut is
decided on; this can easily be ascertained
by ring where the fork goes through
on the forepart, th.- meat being then cut
in rather thick pieces. The under or in
side should be carved In thinner slices
lengthwise.
A Firloin of beef having two qualities
requires different treatment, the upper
part being cut lengthways with the rib,
the undercut being sliced across. Some
very delicate fat will be found at the end
of the undercut, a tiny portion of which
should accompany â¢ eh helping.
It is usual to carve tho undercut before,
commencing the upper side, and th" slices,
though cut thinly, should be less BO than
those from the top. Cut right down to the
bone very straight, leaving no holes or
ridges, a portion of the streaky fat, or
thin end, being given with the meat from
the upper side.
A loin of veal should be cut across
through tho thick part In very thin slice*,
and a small piece of the Kidney and its
fat should be sent to those who like it.
The fillet is carved in thin slices horl
zontally, like a round of heef. When
carving a tongue cut straight through

â melllng stuff on the dishes, but If one
stops tiru! considers that the odor cannot
stay ori a glazrd surface any length of

A MATTER OF CONSCIENCE
/Years tpeJ away, carrying with them
th* doctors youth and the quiet unobtru
â lvenesa of rville. Where willows had
waved and poplars rustled in the old days
tall buildiiiÃs w?re reared, and on the river
banks warehouse* and docks had long
supervened the old mills and picturesque
.stretches of marshy land. As for the old
Ktone house and Us blossoming garden,
they were among the first to fall under
the hai.'l of "improvement."
The doctor, who had never married,
â till lived on the same street, but he was
contemplating a move because Its exclu
slveuess liad been broken In upon and Its
dwelling houses turned Into shops or torn
down and built over as factories. His
own and one or two other frame houses
stood aloof amid all these changes, silent
witnesses of the quiet consÂ»rvativenÂ»ss of
other days.
Dr. Eaton was late. His housekeeper,
Mrs. Brand, was fretting and fuming,
partly because there was a lady waiting
to see him, and partly- and more particu
larlyâbecause his dinner wan growing
crisp and dry In the oven. She went to
the front office door and peeped In at the
delicate looking little woman who had sat
patiently waiting for the last half-hour.
No detail of her shabby bicycle costume
nor feature of her worn, pretty face es
caped the old housekeeper's scrutiny.
"The doctor's late," 1 she said, "but
p'raps you don't mind waltin'. It's a rest
after rldin' a bicycle. How far did you
cay you'd come?"
"From Grimby," replied the woman.
"Did you say Dr. Eaton was quite a
middle-aged man?" she added anxiously
"I didn't say, ma'am; but 1 * pose
you'd call him so In pint of age Ah.
here he is now!"
From the window the lady could see a
doctor's gig draw up at the curb and a
tall, dark man with grizzled beard and
whiskers descend from It. Her counte
nance, fell, and she murmured below her
breath:
"I'm afraid it Isn'tâ"
Just then the doctor entered and looked
Inquiringly at his visitor with keen,
kindly eyes. She rose and said a little
uncertainly:
"Iâ l am afraid I bars mad* a mistake.
THE SUNDAY CALL.

with some one else In a weÂ«?k. And be
sides. I can't vow that I mlijht not find a
new leading man who would prove fully
as attractive as yourself."
Whereupon Robert protested and grew
and that you are not the doctor I'm look
ing for."
Somehow the face and manner of the
woman brought to Dr. Eaton's mind an
illusive memory of a May morning and a
darkened room with th* scent of apple
blossoms wafted through closed blinds
but the impression was vague and tran
sitory, and was gone before he could at
tach any moaning to It.
"You were not looking for me. then?"
he asked. "If you will tell me the name
of the man you want to find, perhaps
I can help you.".
"Iâ don't know his nameâ lâ don't re
member it." she said with a flush and a
littlo deprecatory smile. "I've been to a
treat many doctors in Elllaville and have
not .found himâ l'm afraid he must have
gone awayâ be dead."
Dr. Eaton looked puzzled and eat for
a moment, his eyes narrowed in thought
â â "â â > his fingers beating a noseless tat
too on his knee. The woman watched
him silently, the color coming and going
In her pale face. â¢
"Youâ you don't remember a MrÂ«

eagerness.

peated, shaking his head. "She Is not a

"I will consult my books of that time "
he said kindly, and arose.
As he walked across to the closet where
he kept these records of his early
struggles the woman's eyes followed him
with eager intentness. Suddenly she cot
up and ran to his side.
"Ah. I know It is you! The moment
you walked away, I knew beyond a
doubt. It was Just as If I were back
again In the room where my baby died
and saw you leave me to go for my

breathlessly.
Dr. Eaton had turned and was looking
thoughtfully down into her eager face.
At last he said slowly:
"1 think I do member youâ yes. I
know 1 do. Sit down again Is thÂ» re
anything I can do to servo you. Mrs.
Graf ton?"
"Yes," she answered. She sat silent
a moment looking down at her shabby
gloves. Then she raised her eyes and
fixed them steadily on the doctor's face.
"When we went away from here we
were very poor. We could not nay you.
nor pay for the burial of the baby"â her
eyes dropped and she clasped and un
clasped her hands nervously. "But oh.
how I wantÂ»d to. For a time, after we
left Elllsville. my husband was very
fortunate, and made a great deal of
money; but the debts 1 speak of, while
the thought of them drove me almost
wild, did not seen to trouble him. When
I urged their payment he always grew
Impatient and said they belonged to a
time he could not bear to think of. He
thought I was heartless to remind him
of them. You see." she added hastily,
"the loss of our little hoy preyed upon
his mind and made him depressed and
morbid. So at la.st I ceased altogether
to speak of the matter, and made up my
mind that somehowâ some timeâ l would
pay them myself. About this time I
was taken ill with a fever, and many of
the names of people and places 1 had
known slipped from my mind. Tour
name and that of the undertaker who
burled my poor little boy were among
those I could notâ could not remember.
Yet I never relinquished my purpose to
save enough money to pay you both,
and In all the years after, whether we
prospered or whether we struggled for

no change, the ardent young lover was
oompeJ'.ftd to accept the terms she made.
These were that he was to leave her for

she would think the matter over.
Robert Taber went to London, which
was the nearest place of banishment that
would satisfy bin lady love. He played
minor parts In Sir Henry Irving's com
pany, and played them with success. Irv
ing was pleased an<l the young act.-.r 1
pleaded. The taste of London life
strengthened his ambition, and he plan
ned for a great artistic future "lde by
side with the loveliest creature In all the
world.
For his lore did not change. It stood
the teat of that year â  f stern discipline,
and when the last day of the twelfth
month came It found him In America,
which, being translated, meant Paradise.
Julia was toe same, Robert was the pame.
and there was nothing left but to be mar
ried and live happy ever after.
The first part of this was readily ac
complished. A marriage license and a
minister were easily obtained. The other
part, well
As soon as the marring* had taken
place Julia Marlowe announced that she
was thereafter to be known upon hill
boards and programmes as Mr- Taber.
Friends and manager protested. "Your
name In print means money to nil con
cerned," they Mid. "You hare made a
reputation ah Julia Marlowe. Who knows
Robert Taber or his wifeâ that la, who of
the general public?"
But the unyieldingness that Is part of
her was the same In this affair as In all
others. "I am starring with my hus
band," she replied, and that settled it.
She stopped short at no generosity. Mr.
Taber way ambitious, and his wife
meant that his ambitions should be real
ized. She- hud prospered, and she had
reached the point of sumptuous produc
tions in first class theaters. Robert Ta
ber was given the advantage of all this
prosperity. His wife had old plays
changed to bring him Into greater prom
inence, and she lessened herself. She had
King Henry IV magnificently produced,
and In such a manner that her husband
was made the star and she merely a sup
porting lady. nut for all that, the public
wanted her, they wanted Julia Marlowe,
and they would not give a bagatelle for
the young man who was impertinent
enough to consider himself the trump
card. "lie is a very pood leading man,"
they said, "but he Is no star."
So he found his light growing dim. and
times! And now I think I have enough.
It has taken a long time and only God
knows what a haunting horror has been
to me the thought that my little child's
funeral expenses â that I felt to be a
sacred debtâ wÂ«re still unpaid and lay like
a blemish on his Innocent memory. â¢ â¢ â¢
And now will you tell me how much I
am to pay you. and do what you can to
help me find the undertaker?" A little
sigh of relief escaped her as she con
cluded and the slim, restless hands art
quiet.
The doctor sat with one knee crossed
over the other and looked thoughtfully at
his boot, which he swung gently to and
fro. Presently he glanced up and flashed
a smile at his visitorâ a smile of such sur
passing sweetness that she felt herself
smiling too, half tearfully, In sympathy.
"Twenty years Is a long time to remem
ber a little bill like mine." he said.
"It cannot be a little bill."
"You rode here on a wheel?" he ques
tioned glancing at her dress. â¢'!â¢ Rom
where?"
"From Grimby," she replied.
"And you have dined?"
"Nâ no."
"Then you must be my guest, and after
ward I will help you find that man to
whom you â the other bill. I think I
remember who It was. Are you and Mr.
Grafton living In Grimby V
"Mr. Grafton has been dead some
years," she said, averting her â "I
am teaching school there.
It wan well on In the afternoon when
the doctor and Mrs. Grafton returned
from their search for the undertaker.
They had been successful after many
failures.
"1 cannot tell you how much I thank
you for helping me." she said. "And now
please tell me how much that old bill of
yours was."
"I assure you I have forgotten. I
never gave the matter a thought after the
first. Let it rest," he said earnestly, "and

"Oh, no," she Interrupted, "It must be

itâ not that it is painful to mo to be In
debted to you," she ad. led quickly, think
ing of the doctor's kindness and gentle
consideration. "I shall always remember

glad to remember you so; but don't you
thÂ« management found box ofÃoe receipt*
growing less, and the devoted wife found
her devotion proving futile. A general
state of dissatisfaction ensued.
Something like three years ago the Ta
b-re played their last engagement In Ban
Francisco. It was at the old Baldwin
Theater, and they made thetr temporary
home at the adjacent Baldwin Hotel. San
Franciscans who were with them then
remember thinking that the Rffwt bHla
were decidedly out of tune during that
visit.
There wan no end or petty arguing back
and forth In the win at tho theater, Bad
at the hotel table. "They never quarreled
openly, of course." a friend says, "but
they were always picking at each other."
Yes. exactly; "picking at each other."
"It seemed a itham* for him to be mean

So the observations ran, but neither*
number of the Taber family breathed a
wcrd concerning the discord even to in
â¦ltnat*- friends. It wan not until the en<t
of mat same season that the separation
came. Â»
It happened when they were playtnc
"Bonnie Prince <<harlle" at Wallack"*.
Mr Taber insisted upon responding to
curtain calls meant for his wife, and hi*
Jealousy became so apparent and beyond
control that it was the object of all thÂ«
company's comment. It mi the last per
formance of the two together.
Mr. Taber went to London and returnM
to the Irving company. H.i wife starred
In America a train with her eM name on
the posters. It is nald that her manager
obliged her to b* Julia Marlowe.
Last summer Miss Marlowe went to Eu

The anxious on*s at the top waited a
few minutes for the mÂ»*n to apr>iÂ»ar. They
did not c<ime and an investigation was
made. t It was found that the explosion
had torn away the brick lining of the
!-h:tft. taking with It about twenty feet of
the inui stops. The men below were In a
trap. Promptly a rope and bucket were
lowered and sonr* of th<Â» men hauled up.

was lifted out nml restoratives applied
without avail. He gasped once or twice
nnd was dead, a victim of after damp.
Th.it told the wh<>lÂ«. Ftory of the disaster.
Fire damp had exploded in the mine.
Fourteen men were rescued by the
bucket and rope. All of them were sick
and .'-onie half tinting. They were given
restoratives and went to their hon;< sev
ern! of them having to be carried.
No more mon appearing at the foot ol
the a!r shaft, attention was turned to the
main shaft, from which the after damp
wjis pouring *out In a thick volume. The
fan was crippled and the cages would not
work. The tlrst thing to do was to start
the fan. This was accomplished by 10:30
a, .m., and the after-damp began to force
Its way out of the ventilating shaft. The
lattices in the mine, which guide the air
through the workings, had been wrecked
by the o^t.joslon. and much of the force
of the fan was lost.
Gradually the air around the main
shaft be<-*me purer, and at 3 o'clock the.
first body of rescuers descended, the
cagvs having been temporarily repaired.
WhÂ«-n they got within ten feet of tho bot
tom the cage stopped. a mass of wreck
age was piled up at the bottom of the
shaft. There, ... faces blackened
and burned and their bodies totted, lay
seven men. The rescuers started to clear
away the debris, but It was BIOW, hard
work, ks the force of the explosion had
been Titanic. Pit Boas Thomas and three
men went back 103 feet to tlnd the source.
They think they succeeded, but did not
have time to investigate, aa they
were overcome by the after-damp. Other
members of the rescuing party hastily
brought them above ground, where they
were given brandy and coffee. Thomas
was nearly dead, and to-night Is suffer
ing severely.
When the first party was worn out and
nrarly poisoned another took its place,
and the work was kept up without a mo
ment's cessation. The rescuers found the
carcasses of five mules that had been
killed by the explosion.
At 10 o'clock to-night the work of res
cue had progressed so far that Superin
tendent Blower expected to have some
bodies out by midnight. Mine Inspector
Henry Louttit Is working away In the
wrecked main shaft at the head of gangs
of picked men. who are straining every
nerve to save the survivors If there are
any. Mine Inspector James Bllck, who
read the scene to-night, said:
"I would not like to say there Is no
hope for the men In the pit, but I doubt
whether a single one remains alive. The
fan is running, but the t.lg part of the
mine remains unventilated and Is proo
ably still choked with deadly after
damp. In which no human being can live
If the men have not been able to con

htm two Roumanian princes, tho brothers
Storza. with a message that If Marcel did
not give him satisfaction he would go
down and make mashed potatoes of the
editor, his stair and all the paraphernalia
.if La Caricature.
This of .course brought the Frenchman
to time and â  duel was arranged. Captain
Murphy wanted to fight with Winchester
rinVf. but consented to compromise on
dueling pistols at twenty paces.
All the preliminaries arranged the com
batants with their seconds and physicians
went to a spot near liable, close to the
border of Germany. This was done In or
der to ! ...in certain of a duel.
The combat was of the brief dura
tion, for Marcel was put hors de combat
at once. As ho fell his revolver went off
and the bullet grazed Murphy's arm. The
editor lies in a precarious condition In
Switzerland, while the Irishman Is out
skating In the Bois.
When a correspondent asked Murphy

"The havoc wrought Is almost complete
and I can scarcely hope that the men are

working hard and making slow proÃress.
As the air Is not In the main shaft beyond
this point I see practically no hope for
the entombed men."
As the night grew blacker the scene, at
the shaft became more sorrowful. The
rain came down In pitiless torrents and
each moment the air was more chill.
Rack of :he fateful pit rose a solid mass
of mountainous darkness. In front, but
far across the railroad tracks, were the
flickering: lights of the homos of the m.
ers. At one side' of the mouth of the
â¢-haft some husre lumps of coal madÂ» a
blazing camp fire and around It were seat
ed a score if workers. Many were speech
less over the calamity, while others talked
in whispers and seemed to accept the
doom meted out to their companions with
all the stoicism of men engaged Â»n dan
gerous employment. On the board plat
form that covered the mine grimy min
ers sat with ears bent to hear the faint
est call for succor from the depths. By
an upper window In a house beyond the
tracks could be seen a mourning woman,
her bow-Â»d head visible In the light from

Idle and yet each nurtured that hope that

yet each tried to cling to some impossible
remnant of hope.
No complete list of the dead can be com
piled to-night. The managers of the mine
have the payroll, but It has been Impos

from thirty to thirty-five men are en
tombed. About half are Americans and
the balance Hungarians or Slavs.
Soon after the extent of the accident be
came known undertakers were summoned
from Brownsville. A new building just
back of the mine. Intended for a black
smith shop, was converted Into a morgue.
Here pine boards on trestles were shaped
into receptacles for the dead. All is In
readiness for the victims of the mine

There was an explosion in the Brazriell

BRITONS DETERMINED TO
MARCh ON TO PRETORIA
Following a Lull in Fating Comes a Story That an
Imperial Army Corps hjas Diserr/oarKed at Lourenzo
Marquez and Is on thje Way to trje Transvaal.
General Joubert's Headquarters Camp Near Ladysmith.
LONDON, Dec. 24-4:45 A. M.-Beyond the statement that a heliograph message from Ladysmith
reports "all well to Friday afternoon, with no fighting except outpost skirmishes," absolutely no news
has been received from the seat of war during the night. The War Office officers at midnight sÂ«id they
had not received any war dispatches.
From a Continental Dutch source, however, comes the uncreditable rumor that a British army corps
has disembarked at Lourenzo Marquez and Is marching toward the Transvaal frontier.
LONDON. Dec. 24.âYes
terday was another blank
day. so far as news of any
interest from the seat of war was
concerned. One thing that now
seems beyond all possible doubt
is that the British guns aband
oned at the Colenso battle \sere
really captured and are in the
hands of the Boers. The only
consolation felt here is that,
though General Buller lost them,
the Boers cannot turn their muz
zles against the British as they
have no shells to fit them and all
the ammunition on the British
side was exhausted before the
guns were left to their fate.
It now appears that General
Bnlkr himself had a very narrow
escape. He was hit on his side
by a spent bullet from a shrap
nel shell, but it only cut his skin
and did him little harm.
There seems to be no chnnge
yet on the Modder River so far
?.s can be ascertained, nor is it
expected that there will be for
some time to come â not until the
arrival of reinforcements which
now are well on their way.
News from Sterkstrom would
seem to indicate that there has
been no fighting of any kind
there since December 10, and
that General Gatacre is just wait
ing for the full complement of
his troops before continuing his
advance. The Derbyshires have
now arrived at Sterkstrom camp.
In the absence of other news
the chief talk in clubs and else
where yesterday was again about
Lieutenant Churchill's escape.
He surely is one of the heroes of
the hour.
The story which appeared in
the Herald and Call yesterday
about the traffic in ammunition,
guns and stores and foreign re
cruits for the Boers passing
through Delagoa Bay, wired over
here and produced in the evening
papers, has been much talked
about and commented upon. It
Drawn by Cr.irdin for I.c Monde IlltiMr" from a photnirraph.
is felt that a great deal of that
sort of thing has been going on
and that the British have nut
been half strict enough in keep
ing a better lookout for their own
sakes. Jt is considered possible
that young Lieutenant Chun-hill,
who is not a man to go about
with his eyes and ears shut, will
be able to tell something valuable
of the extent of the Boer re
sources.
The event of the day here un
doubtedly was the departure of
Lord Roberts for South Africa.
The determination that he should
go to take the post of c< tmmander
in chief was sudden and his de
parture has been as quick. (>n
his leaving Waterloo Station his
departure was witnessed by an
enormous crowd, who gave him
a greater and more enthusiastic
send-off than perhaps ever has
been witnessed at a London sta
tion. But, of course, "Lord
Bobs," as he is affectionately
called, is not only one of the most
popular men in the army, but
with the general public as well.
At Southampton it was the same
thing. Now that he is on the sea
and England will not see its idol
again till all is over the question
naturally in the people's mind is
when that will be and how much
more slaughter will be suffered
before the British flag is hoisted
over Pretoria.
AMERICAN HOSPITAL
SHIP MAINE SAILS
LONDON. Dor. 23.â The American hos

the ship sailed notified Major Cabelle
of their refusal to ro. saying one of their
number was ill and they had determined
to stay. Major Cnbello informed them
that their friend had been left in pood
hands, and that there was no reMOn to
desert. The men. BOWCVtt, mad.- other
complaints, whereupon Major C.il>Â« lie in
formed them that they had plenty of time
to consider this beforehand, but If they
refused to go they must sign off the rolls
and leave the chip. This the men did.
and standing on the dock they shouted.
"We are too good Americans to leave a
sick friend here tor any one!"
As the incident occurred at the last
moment. Major Cabclle only had time to
say to a representative of the Associated
Press: "These men came at the last min
ute to declare that they would leave,
making general complaint of ill-treat
ment, which I am unable to fathom.
Some of the papers called them 'order
lies.' which they seem inclined to resent.
I tried to pacify them, but their radical
decision was reached at the last mo
ment and left m.- no time to find a solu
tion. Therefore I had no choice but to
accept their decision to leave and order
th.-m ashore. Their conduct certainly
Is unjustified."
Mr. v.in Purer, a member of the exec

but they will not receive their passage
home. The assistant, who is sick, will
have the best medical care and will be
sent to New York at th.- committee's
expense. The dispute was an incident
which was known only to a few."
The Maine departed under favorable
auspices. The Red Cross tlag Boated
from her foremast, th. Queen's ensign
from her main and the stars and stripes
from her mizzon.
Lady Randolph Churchill was In Â»ier

room was filled with floral decorations of
th.Â» Maine arid Red Crosses, while holly
and mistletoe overhung the doorway.

felt hats, and the surgeons. In the newly
designed â eml-Unlted States uniforms,

Lady Churchill said to the representa

of no better way to spend the Christmas
than on an American hospital ship bound
for South Africa. The Maine is splen
didly equipped and worthy of her people
and mission. I go with a grateful heart
to all who have so munificently aided the
committee. I hope we may prove worthy
of this sacred duty. Wherever the ship
goes. I go." 'H
The final signal for "all ashore" was fol
lowed by many handshakings and fare
wells, and as the Maine moved into the
river three cheers were given for the ship',
then for Lady Churchill and finally for
the United States. Then those on board
gave three cheers for the union jack, and
the sailors on the surrounding craft
cheered the United States as the white

FRENCH FOMENTING

WCTORIA. B C. Doc. -According
to a letter received In this city by John
Mlnto from a fr!.-nd who ts commissioned
with the British army of occupation In
Egypt It seems that the trouble in the
Soudan was still far from being ended
with the defeat of th Dervishes by Colo
nel Wlngate and the death of thÂ« Khalifa
and his Emirs. The people of Cairo, when
the officer wrote from that city on No
vember 10, were facing â  very serious cri
sis. It seems that the French are taking
advantage of the present war in South
Africa to foment trouble. They lire en
deavoring to incite the natives against the
British and With this there Is disaffection
among the Egyptian soldiers because of
the non-production of their pay by tho
Khedive. So serious is the situation that
the general (the writer does not give his
name) has taken refuge with the British
authorities there. With the personal mat

"I can tell you that ihe prospect which

a bit of trouble going on here as regards
the expense of the troop* employed at
the front in the last Soudan war. Tho
Khedive Is rearing up and refuses to pay
the Tommies. Consequently great disaf

LONDON. Dec. 23.â Not for many years
past has Great Britain faced such a sit
uation as confronts her this Christmas.
Yet, to meet It, there has arisen a new
Britain, which by its virility and pluck
extorts admiration even from her bitter
est Continental critics. Since the boast
fulness has disappeared from th.- British
press, the comments of the foreign pa
pers, at least as far as printed here, are
couched in tones far more fair and friend

victory awaited General Buller.

and Liber tad; the Falkenberg was also
seen. Of these only one made port.
On November 22 the bark was still be
ing carried northward and was getting
close in to the Vancouver Island shore,
on which the sea was breaking fearfully.
The American Girl was then again seen,
seemingly under short sail. She was not
Hying any distress signals. The wind was
blowing heavily on shore. The Colusa
was forced to put up all the canvas .-lit'
could carry to bring her around and keep
her â¢ from the rocks. She was Jibing
heavily In a very heavy sea and the bulk
of .water in the- lee bilge turned the bal
last to mud. To add to the difficulties
confronting the crew it was feared that
the ballast would shift, and extra shift
ing boards were put on. Then she began
to make' water, and night <uid day the
men were at the pumps. ' t
The gale gradually increased in violence
until the 2oth. when it was blowing with
hurricane force, the ship running before
It at the rate of eleven knots an hour.
There waa, too, a fearful sea running.
Then began the eighteen days of terror
days when the sufferings of the crew can
better be imagined than described. With
every suck of the pumps up came laifce
quantities of the bark's ballast. The
pumps were bringing up her moistened
stiffening and she was getting very ten
der. With every lurch of the monster
seas all the ballast in the hold surged
back and forth. All the spare. sails and
sacks thai could be obtained were used
In the effort to hold the mud in. Tin*
water tanks were also sent down In the
hold, filled with the mud and secured.
Thus it was for the whole time. That
night the barometer went down to 2S.uÂ»J.
The ship tossed alarmingly and showed
signs of breaking up, the scarfs and cov
ering boards playing open .two Inches.
Captain Bwari then sent down the top
gallant yards, cutting them up to get
them below. The anchor and chains w< re
got out of their lockers and sent into the
hold, in Tact, everything that was mov
able, including the beef and pork, was put
in the hold. "It was an awful time." said
Captain Ewart. "None of us thought we
WoUld pull through alive. The ship was
threatening every moment to -capsize un
der us. The whole crew, headed by the
mate. then came to me and requested me
to abandon her and take to the boats. I,
however, refused to leave her until the
hope of at length getting her Into some
place of refuge failed."
Da] after day the crew continued to
pump and out came the ballast In alarm
ing quantities, giving the vessel a heavy
list to port. Hoping against hope the
plucky American sailors stayed with her
and on the morning of December 10 the
entrance of Sitka harbor was made out.

PASADENA. Dec. 23.â TWb olty"s an
riiiil tournament of roses, to be hold Jan
vary 1, 1900 , â  Id be Uw most sue
.l yet held. It will be the eleventh
of the M rles. The Idea originated with
th- Valley Hunt Club, an organization of
society people, who met at Intervals to
follow the hounds. On each New Year's
morning since ISS3 there has been a grand
parade <if vehicles and equipages, pro
fusely decorated with flowers plucked
from the planta and bushes that wave In
th/- ->oft winter breezes. On the coming
occasion* thf-re will be afternoon sports In
â  tl. M near the town, consisting of ath
1. tic contests, horseracing, rough riding
and novelties. Prizes are offered for the
best features in the parade and for the
events In the afternoon.
After the Valley Hunt Club had given
â .: successful tournaments the peo
ple of the town took the enterprise oit its
hands, and since then it has been a pulnic
demonstration of the pride and loyalty
of the citizens. The Tournament of Roses
Association was formed, comprising the
in' B1 enterprising business bm n and must
loyal citizens. Officers are elected annu
ally to promote the tournament. TherÂ«
are now about 3W members of the associa
tion, each paying *"> Initiation fee and $2 50
per rear dues, in addition to this there
is an Independent â Ã¼bscriptlon fund, lib
erally supported. There is nothing obliga
tory in the association or the tournament
Public spun v-, depended upon to insure
the payni. ni of dues and contributions
Any one delinquent is not expelled the as
sociation, t>ui la allowed to remain under
coals of lire. This plan has proved so
successful that there Is always a balance
in the treasury after the annual bills are
paid.
The officers of the association for 1900
are: H. h. Uertal, president; C. w
Smith, first vice president; James 11
Campbell, second vice president; P IL

THE HEALTH HA3IT.
Just as Easy to Form as Any Other.
We do rot delil>erately form our r"*t I
habits, but they are unconsciously ac-
quired and grow as we grow, arid by the
time we lenrn they arc hurting us. we
find them too strong to be easily broken.
Then, why not form a grxid habit, a
habit which will counteract the many bad
nr.e!Â». in other words contract the un-
fashionable habit of \<f\r>g always well?
The best health habit to g<t Into Is to
hnve and ke< p a vigorous stomach; if you
hnve n healthy digestion you can drink
your beloved coffee. Fmoke your favorite
brand of tobacco, with little or no harm;
<he mischief begins whf-n these things are
forced upon the faithful stomach with-
out any assistance.
Form the habit of taking after meals
pome harmless but efficient digestive
which will relieve the stomach of ko much
t xtra work.
Nature f'irnlshes us with such diges-
tives and whÂ«*n they are combined In
Fuch a pleasant preparation as Stuart's
I'yFpeppla Tablets, they give the over-
workÂ»*d ttomach Just the necessary as-
ristanee to secure perfect digestion with-
out nny of the harmful effects of cathar-
tics and similar drugs.
The habit of takiug Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets after meals is v becessary to the
weak stomach as food Itself, and indeed
to get the benefit from food eaten nothing
better and certainly nothing nafer can be
used.
Many family consider Stuart's Tablets
as essential In the house as knives and
forks.
They consist entirely of natural diges-
tive principles without the en>ct or char-
acteristics of drugs; they have no ca-
thartic action, but pimply go to work on
the food eaten and digest It.
Tiike into recount your bad habits and
the expense they â¢â ntail and then invest M
cents In a box of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tab-
lets and see if your digestion for tho next
month is not vastly improved.
Ask the clerk In nny drug Ftoro thÂ«Â»
name of the most successful and popular
Ftomnen remedy and he will say
"Stuart's."

BOSTON. Pee. 23â The trend of affairs
! connected With the closing of the Globe
| National Hank In this city, for the flrst
time developed a criminal aspect through
I tho placing under surveillance of the
bank's former president, Charles H. Cole.
The charge against Mr. Cole Is the old
one of overdrafts and over-loans, many
! tv himself.
The action of Mr. Wing, the receiver of
the bituk. ordering the arrest, while .1
shock tÂ«> the fnonas of tho former prÂ»-si
; dent, was not a surprise to those who
, haw l>een watching me course of events
I ai.d who were acquainted with the a:"
taira ot the bank. Humor was current
here lute yesterday afternoon that hucli
action would bo taken, but for a wh:ie
It was found Impossible to locate Mr.
Cole. Late last evening word was â  re
; t tlvcd hero that he was on the l>aci:ic
[ Coast, and this noon came the news of
ills arrest .lust outside of Lo* Angeles,
where he had Journeyed with his wife and
Pon. A warrant wa.s sworn out during the
day In this city ar.d dispatched to-night
to Uns Angeles.
In the meantime the brokers and busi
ness men In the city are congratulating
themselves that the week i<r over and
the worst possibly la known. Just how
the affairs In the Ulobe Hank were al
lowed to reach such a stage is probably
known to few outside the former presi
dent, but it Is practically agreed that It
was a gigantic emulation in copper
stocks. In which Mr. Colo became so much
involved that the hank's money and cred
it was usÂ«-d until now well nfgh exhausted.
The Inevitable result followed, except
that the closing of the bank was delayed
for more than a month, and during "the
ast week was holstered up by the Clear
ing-house, which paid Its indebtedness to
v f 'V''" l Â« lf many millions. The fact
thai the bank was In dltÃculty. but yet

to do. he felt It necessary that he should per

more, he knew that so lons as he was with

Up t.-id me that he hud not an anxious

death, but he thought of what might be In

taken, and this weighed heavily upon him. No
man ever deserved better of his country, and

where hla father had taken him to make
: a visit to â¢;.:â¢â¢ M Arthur in March.
His conduct on this occasion was re
! marked by many of the officer* present,
( and General Lawton was urged to give
the lad a. temporary volunteer commission
an aid. He was fitted out In â¢ complete
, uniform of kh^kt. with the proper Insignia
of captain and volunteer aid.
This was never brought formally to the
attention of the Washington authorities,
a. temporary commission from General
Lawton being ail that was necessary for
the extension of the courtesy. Young
Lawton accompanied his father on many
of lii.-i more celebrated campaigns. He
was during the summer months with Gen

breath, heart trouble, dizziness, nerv-
ousness, irritability, lassitude. loss of
ambition, weakness and wasting away.

mer's Swamp-Root, the great kidney
remedy.
It instantly relieves the congested,
overworked kidneys and gradually
brings them back to health.
Healthy kidneys keep down the ex-
cess of uric acid, and you soon feel ths
benefit In new health and Btrength.
Swamp-Root should at once be taken
upon the least sign of II! health. It
will make you well and is for sale
the world over In bottles of two sizes
and two pricesâ f>o cents and 11.

successful remedy for kidney and blad-
d' troubles.

NEW yOHK. Dec 23.-Lyman J. Oapo.
Secretary of tho Treasury, was ln confer
ence at the sub-treasury to-day with J.
Pierpont Morgan and James Stlllman,
president of the National City Hank. Tho
conference lasted an hour, Mr. Morgan
taking leave of the Secretary in advance
of Mr. StiUman. William Sherrer, man
user of the Clearing-house Association.
waa also at the conference for v short
time. In his intorma.l talk to the reporters
mm the conference Secretary Gage said:
"1 was at Bast Orange la^t night aiid I
thought 1 would come over here, tv-day
to see TreÂ»*urer Jordan and talk with him
about the hltuation. While here 1 have
been looking up the evidence of this panic
we hear so much about, as indicated by
the operations of the past year. Lust
Christmas everybody was happy. Money
was easier ana freer. No conditions of
dibtress appeared anywhere in sight. At
the present time there Is v very aifferunt
Christ! feeling, and 1 have been look
ing at the fuels to see what has occurred
to justify the change.
'â¢1 tinu that a year ago this date tho
deposits of the Associated Hanks nf Ne.w
York were $aW.OW,OOO, loans were JTOS.oi*).
â¢OO and cash on hand $21S,tX)u,uo<J. To-day
the deposits aro $740,000,000, a shrinktiKe
of J&J.liuO.OuO. Loans show a decrease of
?:c.0"0.000; cash Â»hows a decnuse of J2>,
000.000, and perhaps at the lowest esti
mate, It would be safe to cay that ten
million in the shrinkage in deposits is due
to the fact that New York charges for
check collections.
"The shrinkage in loans and cash Just
offsets the shrinkage of $36,000,000 in de
posits. The clearing-house statement to
day shows an Increase In reserve of $.1.
600,000 for the week, bringing the surplus
reserves of the banks In excess nf leiral
requirements to substantially $11,000,000.
1 cannot see. looking at it from the out
side, where the panic conditions are Jus

Tho Secretary was asked whether his
talk with Messrs. Morgan and Stillman
foreshadowed any further action on the
part of the treasury. Mr. Gage answered:
"No. not at all."
"Do you propose to accept any more
United States bonds and extend the time
for so doing?"
"No, 1 do not. The option closes to
day."

CREDITORS WANT
AN ACCOUNTING
Suit Against 'he Free-
man Estate.
Special Dlsratch to The Call.
SAX RAFAEL. Pec. 23.â iircd of being
put oft by reiterated promises of payment,
und lons continued evasion of the same,
the creditors of the late Dr. Richard T.
Freeman of Sausallto have petitioned Su
perior Judi;e Anpellottl to Issue an order
citing Miss Jane Lee of Sausallto. the ad
ministratrix of the deceased doctor's es
tate, to compel her to show cause why the
affairs of the estate have not been settled.
The circumstances leading up to the
citation extend over a period of three
years, and at the time of their first air-
Ing attracted much attention and com
ment.
On June If, 1V.7, Dr. Richard T. Free
man, a well-to-do and respected phy.sl
rlan, died in the lodgings he rented from
June Ix"e and a woman known as Mrs.
Bell, at Sausallto. His estate, valued at
US.ooo, conflicted principally of several
magnificent diamonds. As, at the time of
his death, i-o will was to be found, and ii.Â«
was not known to have any relatives In
this country. Public Administrator Eden
took charge >( Freeman* affairs
and property. Hut here he met with
violent and unexpected opposition from
Jane I^ee and Mrs. Hell, who claimed that
prior to his death the dece-ased had made
.1 will leaving his entire estate to them.
This will they wore unable, at the time,
to produce, neither could any trace be
found of the diamonds.
Eden win. temporarily baffled, but after
consultation with the then District At
torney. E. B. Martlnelll. the latter Issued
a search warrant to the administrator. A
close search failed to reveal any trace of
a will or a clew to the whereabouts of
the missing diamonds. . Then, when the
search had been abandoned, the will sud
denly made Its appearance, and after
weeks of litigation and argument wiu
finally admitted to probate. The result
was that Jane Lee was appointed admin
istratrix and her bonds *vere tlxed at $17.
000. Judge Angcllottl, however, provided
that no money or valuables could be
drawn from the bank by either of the wo
men without a signed order from him.
The first result of this ruling was a suit
Bled In the United States Court by the
two women against Martlnelll and Eden
for qo.OOO damages. The ease was, how
ever, never pushed, and finally, for lack
of prosecution was abandoned. From
then till now, the angry and impatient
creditors claim, they have never seen a
penny of the old doctor's money, and on
Tuesday next Jane Lee will have to ex
plain to Judge Angellottl the reason for
her procrastination In the settlement of
Freeman's estate.
Miss Lee's attorneys promise several
highly sensational disclosures, and the
case, owing to the peculiar circumstances
surrounding It, Is exciting .1 great deal of
Interest.

The effect of the strain to which the
trial during the last week or so has sub

to make complaints to his counsel, and
they have asked Recorder Goff if tho
young man could have more exercise and
take stimulants. As a result of this re
quest the Recorder yesterday ordered the
warden of the Tombs to permit Mollneux

Hereafter he will have an hour In the

Southern I'acine and Santa Fe crossing,
ar.d the Southern Pacific freight, which
was crossing the Santa Fe track, passed
on in safety.
The Santa Fe paasenper. duo hero at I

BOYS OVER EIGHTEEN
YEARS MAY ENLIST
CONSENT OF PARENTS IS NOT
NECESSARY.
Far-Reaching Opinion Handed Down
by United States District Judge
de Haven in an Enlist
ment Case.
Boys who have passed their eighteenth
year, who are imbued with military ar
dor and enlist in the navy, must serve
fur the full period of their enlistment, ac
cording to an opinion handed oown yts
terday by United States District Judge
de Haven. The case In issue was that
of Eugene L Norton. 19 years old, who
enlisted on a naval vessel in this har
bor. Norton's mother applied for a wiit
, of habeas corpus and asked for the re
lease of her boy on the ground that lie
was a minor, under the age cf 21 years,
and therefore could not legally enlist
without the consent of his parents.
Judge d<? Haven lays down the proposi
tion that Â«'onÂ«ress has the right to declare
what class of persons shall be permitted
to enlist In the navy and may provide by
â¢law for the enlistment' of minors there
in without the consent of parents or guar-
I dlans. The opinion states further that the
I Revised Statutes provide that minors be
tween 16 and 18 years of age shall not
I r>e enlisted In the naval service without
the consent of parents or guardians and
the Judge nraws the Inference that minors
over the age of l* years may lawfully en
list in the navy without the consent of
! parents or guardians, such consent being
i required only where the eligible minor
Is under the age of 11 yars.
In accordance with the pinion the
court ordered young Norton into the cus-
I tody of thiÂ» I'nited States naval au-
I thorlties to serve for the full period of
; his enlistment. Hert Schlestnger. the at
| torney for Norton, will take an appeal
] to Uv& United States Circuit-Court of A;,
peals.

THE PAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 24. 1899.
CHRISTMAS SURPRISE AT
MAJOR HARNEY'S HOME
MAJOR p. J. HARNET broke â  record last night. For the first time
in his life ho was unable to make a speech. He was struck dumb
when he entered his home last night, and had It not been for the
timely assistance of ex-Governor Budd and his colleagues on the
Harbor Board the major's calamity might have staid with him
many hours. His remarkable experience was entirely due to an elaborate
Christmas surprise party, planned by the employes of the Harbor Commis
sion.
As the major entered his home and saw the glittering baubles of the Christ
mas tree reflected In the burnished surfaces of a massive silver service, that he
knew he had not owned' earlier In the day. he Impulsively looked at his hall
lamp to satisfy himself that he had not entered the wrong house. At th. tame
moment an orchestra tilled the parlors with the music set to the march of a
"conquering hero": a loud laugh came from the darkened dining-room, and
was followed by â  boisterous clapp'ne: of hands. The major was still in i
trnr.ee till he heard, char above all other disturbances, musical or oral. th.Â«
Oaklandesque laugh of W. D. English Then the situation dawned upon him
and he became speechless.
Ex-Governor Hudd spent several minutes trying to restore the major's
equanimity, and seeing the task to be temporarily useless he derided to make
a speech. 'â¢This Is certainly a happy opening of th.> Christmas season." said
the ex-Governor. "We all value th. esteem and affection of our fetlowmen.
We value it most when we can satisfy ourselves that we have at least par
tially merited it. Major Harney erin justly appreciate the fullest extent
the motive that has brought us here. Anxious to show our high regard for
Major Han we have made him this little present, which we hope he will
live long to use. with his estimable wife and charming children. As a ma:-.
Major Harney is the pe<>r of any man' one little glance that we are now tak
ing into his home life testifies to his* value as a husband and father; as a
friend. I need say thing, and as a servant of the State he is deserving of
the highest confidence."

As was published exclusively In The
Call on Wednesday last. Mr.-. KeCord was
attacked in her room in the Parker House
and robbed of $40. and was so upset by the
action of her husband, who participated
: in the crime, that she swallowed the poi
son. The woman was taken to the hospi

of the robbery Captain Wlttman detailed
Otficers Joy and .Wilson on the case, but
they were unable to find the men who
perpetrated the crime.
Mrs. McCord was set on having her hus

kept her eye open lor her assailants, and
last night she located Hagerman and no

FIRST REGIMtNT I?
STILL VERY UNSETTLED
All Because the Upper Office Is So I
Very Slow â Discussion as to '
Life in Camp.
All matters affecting the First Regi
ment of the National Guard of Callfor-
arc as thÂ«.y were a week ago. The
authorities at Sacramento are examining
the muster rolls of the twelve companies
and also examining the oaths and the
surgeons' certificates, to the end that the
lists shall all be correct when the order
1.- Anally Issued admitting the regiment
formally Into the guard; but that upper
Office is very slow.
Captain -Havens of the Fifth Regiment
commanding the company at Banta Rom
has secured a ranee site on a lease for
two years near what is known as the
Rock Quarry, close to the city. The
ground which was obtained a few days
ago will shortly be graded and ranges at
200. 300 and 500 yards trill be established
The company at San Rafael Is making
arrangements to obtain a suitable range
near that city, and expects to secure one
within the next two weeks.
There Is no certainty that a division
camp can be held this year a : Santa
{â run. for at the time that those mem*
bers of the guard who can obtain leave
of absence to go to camp, those men who
belong to the companies that are located
in the farming districts will be so kYirv
that it will be Impossible for them to m
away. The general talk Is In favor of
regimental camps. But It is the opinion
of a number of the guard that the camps
should not be as they have been in C
past, where there is nothing but guard
mount dress parade, close and open or
dÂ« r and the like, but that the men should
be made to perform the actual work t hit
they would "be called upon to , r nrm
they were In service. This would include
marches, reconnaissance, map making
and reports on the condition of the roads
and country. The Idea is to give the â¢i
dlers of the State practical /ork so that
they may know the duties of a soldier
Instead of having a picnic and dances
It is asserted thai as the State will have
to pay for the camp that it should be
money expended to bring about practical
results, so that In case of need offices
and men may know what they are at
It was expected that the superior of
fice at Sacramento, which i 9i 9 so very slow
would have before this either prepared a
new set of rules and regulations for the
guard or Issued an order discarding the
present ones. But neither has been don.-
It is stated by men who have studied the
National Guard laws well and are fn
mlltar with the UnlteJ States army blue
book, that if the superior office will dis
card the present rules and regulations
and issue an order declaring that thÂ«
guard will in future be governed by he
blue book so far as It is applicable in the
guard, that the officers will have a sen
slble guide to go by. But as it in what
they have to guide them is worse than
nothing.

WELLCOME'S GUILT
DECLARED PROVED
Supreme Court of Mon
tana Disbars Him.
GAVE COIN TO LEGISLATORS
Decision Means That the Lawyer
Used Money to Influence Votes
for United States Senator
Clark.
Bfcclal Dispatch to Th
HELENA, Mont.. Dec. .â The Supreme
Court to-day announced its decision in the
Wellcome disbarment case. The court In
an opinion per curlam by the whole court
reviews the recent memorable proceed
ings had before It and concludes by lind
ing that John li. Wellcome must i<e de
prived or the privilege of further actins
as an attorney and counselor at law.
The court begins its opinion by review-
Ing brietly the charges prelerred against
\\ ellcome of bribery and conspiracy â to
bribe, as well as thÂ»Â» recent proceedings
before the court. The court says that in
discussing the case It will eliminate all
charges based upon Information, address
ing itself directly to the question of thÂ«
guilt or Innocence of th. accused on the
specific charge of bribery. On account of
the voluminous evidence taken and be
cause disbarment must be made In ca.-Â»e
either the charge of bribery or tnat of
piracy to bribe Ii sustained by the
proof the court will 1 1. Mine Itself to the
charge of the payment of fIO,OuO to State
Senator Clark of Madison County, refer
ring to the cases of Garr. Whiteslde and
Myer only in so far as It is necessary to
elucidate the Clark charge.
The court discards those portions of th>Â»
evidence bearing on the financial transac
tions of Warner. Gelger and Hobson as
Immaterial. It quotes extensively from
the testimony of Plate Senator Clark as
to his meeting with Whiteslde. the tv*o
planning to meet with Wellcome for tin*
purpose of getting the money to expose
bribery and the scene in Wellcome'Â« room
In the 11. -I. Hotel when the money van
paid to Clark.
In a long review of the evidence thÂ»Â«
court hold.* that the payment of $10,000 by
Wellcome to State Senator Clark to Influ
ence his vote for rnited States Senntor la
proved nnd that Wellcome should be dis
barred for the art.
"LITTLE 80-PEEP"
AT THE TIVOLI
Tt Is a merry Christmas at the Tivoll
with "Little 80-Pet-p." Ferris Hartmnn
has pot his second wiml and monopolize*
the comedy. We r>m- ml - "Teddy" for
many things, but chiefly. I think, for hi
unthinkable costumes, and now that he
is with us again he outdoes all his pre
vious efforts In the mar of jcrotes<iuÂ»Â»
costuminp. There in humor in his Kreen
GainsborouKh In th* lit -â¢ act. and his
habiliments in the second are fearfully
and wonderfully wrought. The question
Is, can he continue to exceed himself?
"Little 80-Peep" fits the occasion suf
ficiently well It has a certain celerity
and the pauses between laughs are not
too lontr. Yet, candidly, I would suggest
to the theatrical mechanic who construct*
our up-to-date burlesques that It would
be wiser â i him not to dump thins* on
the. stage too hurriedly. This mixture of
?:<>od stuff and pood enough stuff Is not
air to any one -neither the public, nor
the acton, nor the author. When the
Tlvoll propose* (it might he more correct
to pay when the management of the Tlv
oll thinks) to produce another extrava
ganza, let It pause. How much better
would It be to take pains! How much
better to cast aside the mass of Indif
ferent dialogue and make the thing clever
from beginning to end.
This would necessitate, perhaps, the
laying over of a contemplated production
for a six-month or a year, but in the end
we would be. served with an entertain
ment that would not only appeal to the
easily pleased, but would Interest the
most blase listener. That would mean a
record-breaking run. and therein the pa
tient author would find his reward.
"Little 80-Peep" has its foundation In
English burlesque and the original rhyme
crops out occasionally. I wonder If It has
ever struck the paraphrasts of English
burlesque that it might be well for them
to make their versions In rhyme. A mod
ern extravaganza with genuine claims to
literary merit would offer a new Interest.
Of the peopJe^aLlhe Ttvoll nomo honor
able mention may be made After Hart
man and very close at that, comes Alf
Wheelan. who. If not good enough for
first comedian. Is almost too good for
second. As old Mother Hubbard he
makes much of the fun. Annie Meyers
Is not prominent, but she carries her part
with the same snap as usual and sings
with a much Improved voice. Miss Morti
mer also sings and right well, though her
merit lies chiefly In a few tricks of vocal
ization that she seems to have effectively
developed. There Is In the second act a
travesty on tho male quartet, that (un
accompanied) abomination that Is more
than half-clever Without further detail,
however. "Little Rn-Peep" cannot fall to
amuse, and. while we attend the coming
of the eonslstentlv clever burlesque, we
can be very satisfactorily entertan by
this "holiday attraction."

friE. BEGINNING Of THE CENTURY.
F~) ETWEEX the authorities who calculate that the
\ twentieth century will begin with the first day
i ~~'^ of January, iyoo, and tho>e who assert it will
rot begin until New Year's day ot* iooi the con
troversy has row reached the point where each side
tlcctarcs the other to be little better than a set 01
The sudden outburst of fury on the subject has been
due to the recently reported determination of the Em
peror of Germany to recognize 1900 as the first year
of the new century and to a decree of the Pope which
according to some authorities confirms the decision of
the Kair-cr, but according to others is capable of a
different construction.
In the decree occurs the passage: "Therefore, in
order that the year 1900, which is about to begin, and
which it is to be devoutly hoped will usher in a far
more happy century, may, by the aid of God and of
His only begotten Son, our Savior, have an aus
picious opening and may close after a prosperous
course, his Holiness, Pope Leo XIII, graciously
grants, etc."

was . the point he replied: "To

From that remark it will be readily inferred that th-
Times of New York stands firmly for 1901. On the
other side stands the Times-Herald of Chicago. In
the speedy city by the lakes they cannot wait a whole
year to begin a new century. They wish to whoop
it up at once, and accordingly the Chicago paper says:
"Some theorists say January I, 1001, while all prac
tir.il people and bicyclists know that it begins at
midnight December 31. iSrjo, where January 1. 1000,
begins. As soon as we cease writing 18 in our date
lines we will be through with the nineteenth century."
The cause of the dispute lies of course in the differ
ence of the point from which the parties begin to
count. In measuring distance we place the first milc
!>'<M a mile away from the point of departure, conse
quently the second mile begins with the first mile
post. A century run is made by a bicyclist the mo
ment he gets to the hundredth milepost, and the sec
ond century begins there, so when he gets to his
nineteenth hundred milcpost his twentieth century be
gins. It is claimed by the other fide, however, that
we measure time differently, and that the year "one"
of our era *.vas dated not from the end of the year,
as a milestone at the end of the mile, but at the be
ginning of the year, consequently the century is not
completed until the end of ! 000.

BY the death of Dwight L. Moody we have lost
the most noted evangelist of our time. He is
said to have been heard by more people than
any other orator -that ever lived, and it is easy to be
lieve it may be so, for he was traveling and preaching
incessantly, and for many years his audiences were
among the largest that could gather within sound of
the human voice.
r While his exceptional gifts as an orator and his
fervent zeal as a preacher were among his most con
spicuous characteristics, it was not solely to them
he owed his splendid success in the work of his life.
He possessed in a high degree the faculty of organ
izing ;ind directing men. That faculty he made DSC
of in his career as an evangelist, and the fruits of it
are to be seen in the institutions at Chicago and
Northfield, which survive him and will continue
his work and perpetuate his memory.
It waÂ« because of his capacity for organization that
Mr. Moody became distinct from revivalists gener
ally who content themselves with exciting religious
fervor among the masses and leave it to other men
to direct it to useful channels. His was a construc
tive nature. He delighted in building up the church
and was as earnest in the silent, hidden work required
J the foundations of some institution as he wa
in rousing tli<- minds and stirring the heart- of a
\ audience by his eloquence.
lii- work in the world has been done well and will
live after him. He Ins not founded a sect as Wesley
did, or as General Booth has done in our generation,
but none the les- In- has deeply impressed his ronvic
and his personality upqn the people, and the in
fiuence will long remain as one of tho>c which tend
c betterment of humanity.

THE CONTEST IN KENTUCKY.
GOEBEL'S supporters have decided to continue
the contest in Kentucky. and to that end have
issued an address which is lurid enough to
revive all the antagonisms of the mo>t heated part of
the campaign. This document, which emanates from
the chairman and the executive officers of the Demo
cratic State Central Committee and the State cani
committee, alleges as grounds for disputing the
l of the Election Commissioners that the Repub
lican- 'ue ballots in violation of law. that the
Republican Governor called out the National Guard
n day and by military force placed unlawful
inspectors and challengers in the election booths,
that Federal and State Judges interfered with the
elections by issuing "every injunction and manda
mus asked for by the Republican party," and finally
that the railroad corporations of the State furnished
the Republican party with an immense corruption
by which thousands of votes were bought and
r the Republican cai
These arc grave charges, and since they have been
irward by. men holding responsible positions in
â  â¢ hould be investigated. There is no rea
â â  hy the Republican candidates should fear the
me of a judicial inquiry. The election was co:i
1 under a law devised by Goebel himself. The
machinery was of his own construction and was de
signed by him to enable the Democratic party to
count their men in no matter how the people vote I.
The methods made u^e of l>y G.iebel to force his
own nomination upon the party caused the better ele
.nciu among the Democrats to revolt, and it is 'o
that fact his defeat has been attributed. If now his
supporters wish to go into the courts and have the
tactics of the campaign and reviewed the
Republicans should certainly encourage the move
ment.
The action of the Election Commissioners satisfies
the public that the Republican candidates were legally
elected. The commission is Democratic in its make
up and was popularly regarded a^ a part of the Goe
bcl machine. The fact that a majority of a board >o
composed was forced by the evidence submitted at
the hearing to grant certificates of diction to Repub
lican candidates' is proof of the ju-tice of the Repub
lican claim.
An appeal to the Legislature may have the result
' taining from that body a reversal of the action
of the board, and Goebel by that means may succeed
in getting possession of the governorship. It will re
quire, however, a good deal of partisan assurance 'o
induce the Legislature to overrule the action of the
Election Board, and it is for that reason the support
ers of Goebel have set forth such extravagant reasons
for the proposed contest. Nothing less than a charge
which combines allegations of ballot-box stuffing,
government by injunction and military dictation at
the polls will even in the minds of Kentuckians
Hushed with Bourbon justify the unseating of Gov
ernor Taylor for the purpose of putting Goebel in the
c fllce.
The public meetings in favor of park extension are
over, but between now and election day there will still
be a good deal of time for progressive citizens to
talk to their friends on the subject and get them in

â ^^g^r with which men received those glad

through all pur slowness of heart, our lagging hope and
faith, and have patience with us as we ring and sing once
more the old Christmas message â while we hunt the Boers
in South Africa and chase the Tagalogs in Luzon.
For with all the ground for discouragement there is no
need for despair. Mr. Alfred Russell Wallace, in his "Won
derful Century," sums the discoveries of our nineteenth
century in a manner which ought to elate every thoughtful
mind. He shows that we have achieved, in the way of mas
tery over nature, not only more than any other century, but
more than all previous centuries put together. The triumphs
of physical science in our century are but the precursors of
the triumphs of science in the twentieth century. No visions
of the dreamers can equal the sober expectation of those
who forecast the developments of science in another hun
dred years. The powers of nature are trooping to the feet
of man. Man is the modern Aladdin, holding in his hand
the lamp of knowledge, in rubbing which the Genii of
earth and air and sky come forth to do his bidding. He is
going to have power to do almost anything he wishes with
the world before another century rolls round and the
Christmas bells ring out in 1090. There will be power to
make a new world out of the old world if man really wants
to do it.
It does not look altogether on the surface of things as
though man wanted very heartily to do this. Selfishness
seems rampant. Greed appears triumphant. The brute f'.rc
of money claims to rule everywhere. Below the surface,
forces are making for something better.

GRIP
A year a^o.
A year ngo the papers were so full
of scare lines and cartoons of Epidemic
Grip that the local advertisers protest-
ed that people were being frightened
away from the stores, threatening the
holiday trade. The papers took the
hint and the next day it was "Grip
under control." "Grip subsiding," etc
This year Grip Is '^uite as prevalent,

BIG SPORTING EVENTS
FOOTBALL AS A CIVILIZING
MEDIUM FOR AMERICAN INDIANS
MONTEZUMA, M.D.. the medical direc-
CARIvOS accompanies the Carlisle School football
tor who accompanies the Carlisle School football
1 ] team, stands as the most perfect type of tho clv-
V-^ ilized American Indian. His romantic life, with
broken periods oÂ£i transition from the barbarous to
the nineteenth century Etate, presents a living example
of the effects of what he considers the greatest civilizing
forceâ an Independent existence among white citizens. He
is the chief representative of a latter-day school of
thought relative to the Indian question as presented to
our Government for solution that takes decided opposi
tion to the reservation scheme and advances in lieu tho
dissemination of the tribes among the various States of
the Union, to be educated in public schools and to become
citizens of the Union.
This suave, Intelligent, dark-haired, dark-skinned doc
torânow a well known Chicago practitionerâ finds his
earliest recollection of childhood among the Pimal Moun
tains of Bunny Arizona, for Montezuma is a full-blooded
Apache of the generation of thÂ© terriblo Geronimo. his
antithesis in the crude savage characteristics of cruelty,
cunning and revenge. A midnight raid by the neighbor
ing Pi mas against the Apache retreat while tho braves
were away on a mission of peace made- the boy, then lit
tle more than a papoose, a prisoner In a new territory.
A few days later twenty dollars of the white man's
money made him the property of a C. Gentile of Chicago,
and with his Indian nature still unformed he was thrown
in the cosmopolitan civilization of a big city at the age
of five years as the ward of his purchaser. When his
benefactor, for such he was. died Carlos Montezuma, in
his eleventh year, having something of a grammar school
education, was left to shift for himself. Drifting to
Champaign, 111., be worked at odd Jobs, managing to con
tinue his studies, ard In dub course of time by dint of
hard work and perseverance graduated from the Univer
sity of Illinois. Five years later he had taken a degree of
medicine at the Chicago Medical School, a branch of the
Northwestern University. Men of Indian nativity of the
caliber of Montezuma were then as now in high demand
by the Government as attaches at the several reserva
tions. Seven years In all wero spent by the doctor in the
employ of Uncle Bamâ three of them at the Western In
dian stations of Fort StevenÃon. North Dakota; Western
Shoshone agency, Nevada, and Colvillo agency. Washing
ton, and two as resident physician at the Carlisle Indian
School In Pennsylvania. A close study and observation of
Indian conditions had opened his eyes to appalling defects
In the system of civilizing the aborigine, and having from
Ftern conviction no longer at heart tho scheme of our In
dian regime he resigned his position to take up the active
practice of medicine In the city of his adoption In the
white man's world, where after six years of labor he is
to-day known as a clever man In his profession and as an
up-to-date thinker, of strong ideas and expression.
Dr. Montezuma's theme of thought and argument on
the American Indian question is, as etated In the forego
ing, chiefly aimed at the reservation scheme of the offi
cials of the Department of the Interior, whose methods,
however, It may be said, reflect the Ideas of hundreds of
so-called Interested Americans who have superficially
studied the problem of Indian civilization. All of this
scheme, Montezuma says. Is misdirected philanthropy.

disprove this.
Within forty-eight hours all desire for the drug which he had used for

FINE LIBRARY BUILDING FOR THE

mAYOR rHF.T.AN has made an offer to the. Board

construct a suitable building for a branch of the
library In the district south of Market street. If
the- Mayor's offer is accepted that section of the city will
have- on* of the finest public library buildings in the
State. Some time ago, when the Mayor was making Im
provements on the property owned by him in the vicinity
of S^uth Park the ry of the Library Board com
municated with him, n.sklng if he would lease a compart
ment in his new building for a branch library. The May
or's reply was characteristic of the man.
"It occurs to me," wrote the Mayor, "that the city
should own its own branch library building? and have
them attractive In appearance, commodious and well

VIEWS OF AUDITOR WELLS
TWO MONTHS' UNPAID SALARIES
MUST BE PAID FIRST.
The Finance Committee of the Board of
Education will m^et Auditor Wells on
next Tuesday or Wednesday in order to
devise ways and means to pay JUaw of
miscellaneous demands Incurred by the
board June of this year, and which
were never paid. Resolutions were passc-d
at the last meeting of the board to the
effect tlmt as there would be a ...us la
the school funds these claims should be
paid out of such burplus. Auditor WeJls
Is not so cure that this can be done. In
discussing tha matter yesterday he said:
"If there is a surplus in the school funds
at the end of the present fiscal year, and
l believe there will bo, the law euys very
clearly that It must be carried over into
next year and cannot be applied to pay
ment ii old claims. I would iike to bee
my way clear to passing these demunds
that were legitimately contracted lust
June, but I have closed my account ami
they have never been calleu to my atten
tion.
"The only relief I can see la that from
moneys collected as inheritance taxes. 1
expect a cettlemcnt from the State re
garding tho Stanford estate In a few days,
and the school funds will be enriched to
the extent of about J7O.UW. Now 1 regard
lhat money as belonging to the city on
the day that Mi Stanford died, therefore
it can be applied to the- claims unpaid of
that and subsequent years.
"Not taking into account what was
termed by Judge Seawell as the "illegal
payment' 7 in June. 1537, of JU3.4IJ IS when
there was that amount of shortage in the
school funds, we come down to the
teachers' warrants of November and De
cember, IK>!>. amounting to 5^4.405 70 and
J%.C2 40 respectively. I am of the opinion
that the Inheritance tax moneys must
first be applied to paying these demand*,
and as more of such moneys come In we
may discharge all those obligations until
we arrive at the claims for $0000 in June,
IS&9. Only then can these latter claims be
paid, as the teachers' demands must of
necessity take precedence. It is possible,
too. that the surplus now contemplated
may be used In some way, but I must
consult my attorney 111 that. After the
teachers' salaries are paid now there will
remain about $14,000 a month for other
purposes. As very little is now being
epent for repairs to Bchoolhouses thero
ought to be a pood surplus at the end of
this fiscal year.

"MINTNO GROUND" DEFINED.
6upreme Court Passed on a Point of
Much Importance.
The California Lustral Company, a rnln
inp corporation, undertook to mine a min
eral deposit cast of Oakland for the pur
pose of manufacturing paint. A plant for
grinding and refining the natural product
wag erected. In order to carry on ope
rations, the company borrowed money
from J. J. Johnson, giving him two notes
of $5236 each and a mortgage on the 104
acres of land being mined to secure their
payment. The venture was a failure and
Johnson sued to foreclose the mortgage.
The action was resisted on the ground
that under the law it was unlawful for
the directors to sell. lease or mortgage
mining property without the ratification
of the holders of two-thirds of the capi
tal stock. This brought up the question
as to whether the mortgaged property
was "mining ground" or agricultural
land. The lower court found that It was
agricultural land holding that land can
not be considered as mining ground un
less minerals can be tak.-n therefrom in
paying quantities. Judgment went to
Johnson.
The Supreme Court takes a different
view of tho meaning of mining ground
It holds that the opening of shafts run

DEATH CLOSES AN
HONORABLE CAREER
JAMES A. THOMPSON, THE DEAD BANKER.
JAMES A. THOMPSON, the banker. Is dead. The close to an honored
career came suddenly on Friday night, and under conditions which
made it exceptionally sad. A month ago the banker was apparently
In perfect health. Then Illness attacked his wife, and death ended her
sufferings. No consolation could relieve his distress and after .1
month of brooding he died. Five of his six children were with him at the. end.
Mr. Thompson was one of the best known men In the financial world of
San Francisco. For many years he occupied positions of trust and responsi
bility, and was looked upon as one of the leaders in the local world of finance
At the time of his death he was secretary and cashier of the Donohoe-Kelly
Bank. He had occupied this position of responsibility for several years. His
education In finance was received in the banking " house of John Paxrott,
where for several years he remained as a trusted employe.
In banking and commercial circles Mr. Thompson was widely known and
highly regarded as a man of undoubted integrity and line business qualities
For many years he was connected with the Sather Banking Company. He
came into wider prominence when Governor Waterman appointed him Bank
Commissioner. His knowledge of financial methods and real estate values, to
gether with the Information he possessed regarding individual responsibility,
rendered his service on the commission exceedingly valuable to the public He
resigned his State office to accept the position of manager of the Mutual Sav
ings Bank when that institution was founded by Mayor Phelan and other
capitalists. Through Mr. Thompson's solicitation Albert Gerberdlng was ap
pointed as his successor as Bank Commissioner.
.Â», Mr. Thompson left ,t, th c Mutual Bank to accept his position as cashier of
the Donohoe-Kelly Bank. The change brought to him larger remuneration
and greater responsibility. As a banker he was admittedly one of the lead
ers In the city.
Mr. Thompson was one of the founders of the, Bohemian Club He was
admitted to membership on May 6. 1873. when the owl's abode was on Sac
ramento street. He served one term as treasurer of the club and in April
I? 8 ' s/aa Â«*â¢*â¢* to the office of president. By virtue of his position he was
sire of the Christinas high Jinks one year ago. Last night many of the
Bohemians assembled at the club to celebrate the Christmas high jinks of
th l? 7B7 Bp Â° kefe Â° f the^ mr T. lllUes Possessed by Mr. Thompson and re
called with tenderness the kindly attributes of the lamented ex-nrcsldent
to The funeral of the dead banker will take- place to-day! and Â£ Â° bed â

The new auxiliary gasoline schooner
Surprise came down from Benicia yester
day. She Is Intended (or the Hawaiian
interisland trade and will carry sugar
from the various plantations to Honolulu
for shipment to New York and San Fran
cisco. Tho Surprise is the pioneer of an
auxiliary fleet of schooners for the Ha
waiian-trade. Another vessel is now on
Turner's ways at Benicla for the owners
of the Surprise, and two more will be
built next year. 'â . .
The Surprise is 102 feet long. 24 feet
broad and 3 feet deep. L Oder ncr auxil
iary gasoline engine sÂ»he cam*: down irom
Uunicia yesteruay at an average rate of
eight Knots an aour. Captain norton
will commanu her, and sue will go out
loaded to the guards with genera* mer
chandise. McCnesney &, Co. of lionuiulu
are tiio agents for the new line, anu tney
expect to Handle a large quantity of sugar
next season. The Surprise will carry 150
tons of the raw material, and the new
"boat now building 2UU tons. The latter
vessel will' nave me largest gasulino en-
Kino ever built on this coast.
The transport Westminster, with 400
horses and mules aboard, was to have got
away for Manila last night, but was de
layed owing to some of the supplies not
being on hand. The vessel was towed
Into the stream last night and will get
away early this morning. Of the animals
aboard the Westminster 150 were on board
the Victoria when sho had her hard timo
on* Cape Flattery. The horses were all
more or less injured and bad to be landed
at Seattle. Alter recuperating the ani
mals were sent here by rail arid put
aboard the Westminster.
Captain McLeod. formerly master of tho
ship James Nesmith, goes to Honolulu on
the steamer Marlposa next Wednesday
to take command of the ship Henry 11.
Hyde. The latter vessel was recently pur
chased by the California Shipping Com
pany along with the Flint fleet and Is one
of the tint American ships afloat to-day.
She Is on her way from New York to
Honolulu, and Captain McLeod expects to
find her there on his arrival. The Hyde
is considered the best vessel in the new
company's fleet, and there was consider
able wirepulling among the ship captains
of the concern to secure her. The plum
has fallen to Captain McLeod.
Another Captain McLeod that is playing
in luck is the late master of the brig Lur
line. He left last night for the East on
his way to Scotland to superintend the
building of a new four-masted steel bark
entine for Hind, Rolph & Co. On her com
pletion Captain McLeod will bring her out
hero and run her in the Island and Aus
tralian trade.
The bark Roderick Dhu sails to-day for
Hllo. Captain Johnson Is a great favorite
With the traveling public, and in conse
quence the vessel cannot carry all the
passengers who want to sail on her.
Every inch of sleeping accommodation is
taken on this occasion, and the vessel
could not carry another ounce of freight.
Besides all this sho carries a large deck
load of mules.
The fate of the bark Colusa has at last
been ascertained, a dispatch to the Mer
chants' Exchange yesterday stated that
she had been abandoned near Sitka. but
that all hands were saved. The vessel
must have been driven away out of her
course, and becoming unmanageable
drifted ashore.
The harbor police are gradually arrest
ing all the members of the Rung of "wharf
rats" that has infested the water front
for months. Sergeant Ellis. Detective
Reynolds and Oflicer Cavanaugh captured
William Ryan. William Golden and Jo
seph Bantry yesterday and charged them
with robbery. The thieves used a small
skiff, which they hid under the wharves
when not in use. and got away with hides,
tallow, canned Roods and all kinds of gen
oral merchandise from the wharves along
the front. Santry is nald to be the ring
leader of the gang and Ryan his first lieu
tenant.
and gave some of her attention to the
management of the grocery.
The other day the daughters were hor
rllied to overhear their mother conclude
an arrangement with a Portuguese named !
Manuel Morris by which the latter was
to receive $10 for murdering her husband.
Morris was told to hide In the stable loft
and at night when Sllva ascended to gel
feed for his horses. Morris waj to knock
him on the head with a heavy club.
The daughters Informed their father of
the plot they had overheard and EUlva
proceeded to hunt up Morris. From the
latter he secured an acknowledgement
that he had been asked to perform the
gruesome job. Sllva reported the matter
to the acting Chief of Police and the lat
ter, satisfying himself that Morris did
not desire to carry out Mrs. Silva's
wishes, advised Silva to go Into hiding
for a few days so that development might
be watched.
Yesterday Morris reported to Mrs. Silva
that he had dispatched her husband ac
cording to orders and Mrs. Bllva was
more than delighted, saying that she
would givo him the promised $40 as soon
as she could go to the bank and draw it
Mrs. silva had some doubts, however, for
she told Morris that she wanted to be
come thoroughly convinced of her hus
band's death before she parted with the
coin. She added that after the death had
been established she would come into pos
session of her husband's ranch, which
would enable her to give Morris a bonus
for his deed.
Since Silvan absence from the store
Mrs. Sllva has not once Inquired as to
his whereabouts nor evinced the slivhtext
concern in him. the thought that he was
duly dead appearing to satisfy her. The
case is about as hard a one as the. local
police have had to wrestle with, but there
appears to be good ground for the belief
that Mrs. Sllva's murderous thoughts
have had their origin In some strange and
unsuspected dementia.

Greenway in Tan * 'Knick
ers" Leads the Golf
Cotillon.
THE golf cotillon, the flrst affair of
its kind in this Western metropolis,
was a merry success and ths pa
tronesses are receiving congratula
tions from all who were fortunate enough
to attend either as participants or specta
tors.
The affair took place at Cotillon Hall
yesterday afternoon and was modeled
afttr a similar affair that was one of the
soc-la.l successes of last year's New York
Beason. Golf costume was supposed to be
de rigueur. but although all of the fairer
sex obeyed the law to the letter many of
the nun shied at the "knickers" and came
in business suit instead.
It was originally intended that the la
dles wear white pique golf dress, relieved
by a crimson tie and sash. Many broke
away, though, from the details of the cos
tume, and varied the ilres-s by wearing
colored skirts and having the shirt waist
of silk or shilling satin. The effect of
Urn whole, however, was pretty in the
extreme. G >tillon and
a!so, for that matter, in the fashion of
lie was In n-Rulatlon golf COStamfl
of a natty tan shade and his shanely
nether extremities were encased in bril
liant golf hosiery. His tit- w.is pink, his
low â noes a brilliant orange and alto
gether he was dellcloualy "rsinbowy." It
was intended that the dance begin at 3
o'clock. The guests us usual, however,
were late in arriving, and It was 1 nXn X
past 4 before the cotillon began. Four
ligures were danced, all new and original,
with a decidedly golfy flavor to them all.
Those in the first set were: Miss Edith
Preston. Wartnlnffton Ames. Miss The
vsr> Morgan. Norris Davis. Miss Ethyl
Hager, Willard Drown. Miss Florence
Josselvn. E. C. Sessions, Miss Isabel Kit
tle. Mr. Carrlgan. Miss Olive Holnrook.
A. Stone. Miss Mary (Greenwood Josselyn.
Mr. Cadwalader. falsa Elizabeth Ames.
Dr. Elrlght. Miss Ruth McNutt. Frank

The patronesses of the affair were:

Mrs. W. P. Morgan. Mrs. Charles Josse
lyn, Mrs. S. G. Murphy. Mrs. W. F. Mc-
Nutt. Mrs. John Kittle. Mrs. E. J. Mc-

Clerkâ The cases there
Are all. of course-
Judge â Say not; say not
Clerkâ Are all divorce!
Doem and Skinnemâ Of course, they are

Judge â
I 'most despair of change,
As I'm a sinner;
Divorce for breakfast, same for lunch.
And ditto dinner,
Is diet like to give a dog the mange!
SONGâ Judge.
Time was. and not so long ago,
When a decree, a vinculo.
Was simply out of question.
All Judges, singly and In bank.
In holy horror rightly shrank
From any such suggestion.
All

From any such suggestion.
Judge-
As time wore on there, in due course
Came kingly yearnings for divorce,
And Judges knuckled under.
'Twas but a step. then, to unhitch
The maritally jaded rich
That pungled up the plunder.
All-
The maritally Jaded rich
Soon pungled up the plunder.
Judge â
For years the poor man had no show,
No court would hear his tale of woe
And conjugal affliction;
Until in this, our happy clime.
Divorce Is gained In record time
Without the least restriction.
All-
Divorce is gained In record time
Without the least restriction.
Judgeâ
The reason is not far to seek:
A Judge at so much coin per weelj
Cannot make any great objection.
When voters crowd pell-mell to court
To file their suits and vow support
To him before election.

If anything could drown the grief I feel
It Is such floods of sympathy as these;
But I do not think it proper to conceal
I feel the tide of tears about my knees.

Mrs. T. (dramatically)â On that point

ALAMEDA CITY WANTS A NEW CHARTER
/\ LAMBDA. Dec. 23.â AJameda is engaged in a fight for a new charter. The citizens of this commu
nity feel that the city has outgrown the present law under which it is working, and all of the resi
dents of Alameda who are interested in the advancement of the city are working for this reorganization.
The gentlemen interested have so far succeeded that the Board of Trustees has called a Freeholders' elec
tion for February of next year, at which time the voters will select men to frame a new charter for them.
The leaders of this movement tell the people of Alameda why they need a new charter, through The
Call.
ALAMEDA NEEDS A NEW CHARTER BECAUSE SHE
NEEDS SELF-GOVERNMENT,
B. C. Brown,
A I- A MED A needs a new charter be
cause she needs self-government.
Her present charter Is that of a
city of the fifth class. Her tax
rate Is fixed mI her taxes apportioned
to the various funds by a board of five
Trustees. Her funds are spent by those
Trustee?. There la no Mayor, no Auditor
over th.-m. no check upon them. There
are therefore no meant of determining re
sponsibility.
We have .1 population of 16.000. Proba-
My no city in the State can show a higher
average of intelligence and moral worth
than can Alameda. By our present char
ter ire are tied to the apron strings of
the Legislature. We have no power of
determining our form of government. We
are at the mercy of each succeeding leg
islative body, and our organic law has
been changed at each session for many
yearsâ often to our detriment and against
our protest.
Alameda is old enough, strong enough
and wise enough to govern herself She
wants no outside interference with her
family matters. 13he needs to discard her
present irresponsibility of government, In
which five men divide responsibility and
each can hide behind the other. She
needs (as does any corporate body) to
have a head â one head. She needs a wise
application of civil service principles.
She needs a more direct application of
the popular voice in her self-government.
She needs to have her School Depart
ment, her Fire Department, her fret; li
brary, her electric light system (which
she owns) removed as. far as possible
from the rule of the political boss,
With a Mayor in whom shall be vested
the power of appointment of members of
the School Board, the free library trus
tees and other officials, the responsibility
can be centralised, It Is easier for the
people to elect one good Mayor than it
is to choose a high average of a dozen
different officers.
The power of levying and apportioning
tax moneys and disbursing public funds
should not be vested In the same board.
Over ill should be not only a Mayor, but
an Auditor. A civic corporation can no
more be successfully conducted without
a responsible head than can a private
corporation. A new charter will not add
to the tax rate. If properly drawn, it
will â :â  â  Utor would

. <rltiiipm of the manner In whirh our Board
of City Trustees is constituted ahall ri"t bt- thouKh: to cover
PRESENT ALA/V\EDA CHARTER IS INADEQUATE TO
THE NEEDS OF THE CITY.
THERE nrÂ« many mmd and strong arguments in favor of i
a new charter Â£or Alameda, based on the fact that the
present law is antiquated: that it Is made by and amend- |
able by the legislature; that the body of citizens governed !
by it have no voice in altering it except through their single |
representative In the Legislature, while many extraneous cir- |
cumstances threaten to change it at any session of the Legis- j
lature; that AJameda'a control over Alameda'a affairs will be j
more direct nnd less likely to be merged Into a greater city's I
affairs under an individual charter, and so on.
But to my mind the most convincing arguments against con
tinuing longer under the present organic law and In favor of
a new charter are found In the records of the municipal affairs.
The history of jar and friction, of charges and counter-charges,
of lawsuits and compromises between various oillcluls of the'
LOOKING TOWARD THE FUTURE IA/HEN THE ROFÂ»-
ULATION DOUBLES.
y BELIEVE that the city of Alameda would bo much better
I governed In the future, when Its population will have be
envern^'i In th<> future, when its population will have be-
I come larger under the new charter along, the proposed lines
than It would be under the existing one. That our city has
been so well governed In the past Is partly due to the fact
that every one ii well acquainted with every one else and that
very careful selection of officers could be made In convention.
This state of affairs cannot continue Indefinitely in the future
as regards all elective officers, particularly the minor ones.

There never %\as a inure pleased nor
happier as^emblaKe in Mission i'arior Hall
than <>n last Monday nlgm, 0:1 the occa
sion of the Nimroa lisii sociai given by
Las l-omas Parlor. It was a puzzle to
understand why the invitaiion cards had
printed on them "Mmi social," lien it
w;is tn be a nshing party, ami 11 v.as not
until some one v.cli up In Hiblicai lore
explained that, according to Genesis s:9,
NimriHi was a mighty hunter mtui. accord
ing t <Â» Milton, ii. "Paraui.-e Lost," and to
Pope, Nlmrod'a prey was the eons of men.
Kn.in the large number of Native Sons
pre.-etu. sons of pioneers, it wa-s evident
thai the members Â«>f ihe parlor had ail
been active Nimrods. The programme
that was presented had for features an
umbrella dance, a fancy dance, cake
walking, vocal selections, dialogued reci
tation*, French ballads and i'To^morrow,"
a farce, the cuntributora to the entertain*
ment being: Lil Gregory, Eunice Miller,
Hazel Duggan. M. Magulrc. Master l.'ar
ncl. Miss i^etghton. William Miller and
Goorse Adore. Tlure was in addition a
tish jMÂ»nd. also a fortune-t-ller, the many
who attended catching their Christmas
presents with silver hooks from the lirst
named and learning all about themselves
lrom the latter. And there was dancing
until 11 o'clock, when the guests partook
of a "lish" collation. The only thing on
the table outside of delicacies that bora
any resemblance to tish was a miniature
paper one on the table before each guest,
ail built on the same pattern, but each
labeled with a different name.
At a recent meeting of l.as Lomas Par
lor tlie majority of the members attended
a Russian wedding, thai w:ls in enter
taining feature got up by the good of the
order committee. Members took part in
the wedding, which was productive of
much amusement. The groom, Julius

Nuns Who WorK at the Forge in
Cape Town.
In South Afrlra is a band of nuns who
not only pass their lives in relfKiou.i devo
tion, but havo ndoptrd the role of new
women In â  strani?o character. F..1..-- r to
sow the seeds of religion In South Africa,
they turned their backs on the time-hon
ored convents of Europe and established
themselves under the name of the Sisters
of St. Dominic near King Williams Town,
Cape Colony.
Hut In the new country where the nuns
set up their habitation the Boer neighbor*
looked upon their work with suspicion &nd
resentment, and even the English lookod
with disfavor upon the convent. The con
sequence was that the sisters bought an
extensive farm, and finding that farm la
borers were scarce In a land where most
of the digging was for gold and diamonds,
solely as a means of self-support the nuns
put their hands to th* plow. Bui accident*)
will happen, even In a convent, and In
time the plowshare became broken.
There being no blacksmith In that re
gion, the nuns sent to Cape Town and got
the materials to build and the tools und
implements to supply a smithy. A blacK
smlth as a tutor was found, and the nuns
learned how to become blacksmiths. They
have thus far proved not only their equal
ity with man. but their superiority to him.
for when the blacksmith, disregarding his
religious environment, went on a pro
longed spree the nuns speedily forced him
out of the settlement and determined
henceforth to do all their own work.
But the nuns went even further. They
found that blacksmlthlng among the Boer
and English residents was profitable
work, and they built a smithy, with a
brick forge, a strong, capacious bellows
of oxhide and all the customary parapher
nalia incidental to the vocation of the vo
taries of Vulcan, and established them
selves as a convent of female black
smiths. . ; N
The feminine blacksmiths of the Domin
lean convent are experts. The presence
of th.- hammer-swinging nuns seems to
exercise a sort of fascination over the rest
of the neighborhood, for they â¢rill go out
of their way In their dally tasks to gazo
at the hard-working sisters of tho smithy.
At close range the most striking effect
in the appearar â¢ of a sister of Rt. Dom
inic, as seen In South Africa. Is h*r rosn-,
tanned face, so different from the- blood
less, white complexion of the nun under
ordinary conditions.â Chicago Tlmes-licr

or all of them combined were more properly

The whole may be summed up In the term

r>n Monday, when the ammciated hanks of New
York, by concerted action, offered lin.ow.ouo in
loans and broke the money rate, which had
jumped to >4 per oÂ«-nt a day, equivalent t" I>>Â«
\*r annum In the frantic bidding of hard
j !â¢ .- â â  d holders. Witb the raring of the money
rate the panic was checked ana the procredlnÃs
reduced to some M>rt of order. The market,
however, continued fevrrUh 1. II through the

world- wide effect, forcing up btorltntt exchange

dened with Â«-xtrÂ«"nllnary commitments on ac
count of the great Industrial combinations, has
been thus cut fn-in the expected replenishment
by cold ImjKJitr on account Of the continued
favonnc trade balance. Also the usual au
tumn reflux of money from the Interior to New

. entirely cusj*nded this year, owing to the
business activity all over the country. Still
â¢ n..ther adverse facti.r wan the continued ab

ury owlnÃ to the unexpectedly large revenues
w.nch have Â«>stutiliÂ»hed a running surplus. The
flraln has been particularly oppressive on New
York owing to the lame proportion both of
Hie custom and Internal revenue taxes which
are paid thr.uch New York l*artna--hauae

Associated Banks' Statement.
NEW YORK. Dee. 13.â The statement of the
New York banks for the week ending I><Â»cember
23 Is decidedly favorable In it.- showing, â¢â Â»Â«
pectalljr with reference, to ca?h changes. The
gains in legal tenders and specie were $3.572. 100.
and as the Increase in deposits wan only nom
inal, thÂ» new cash Â«â  to meet excess reserve,
bringing that Item to f10.3M.075. the highest
point t:v,i.-h.-.l since last August. The state
ment has teen affected by a number of Influ
ences of conflicting and unusual character,
which perhaps explain why the final flfur>*H
are at variance with earlier estimate.*. To b<-
Kin with, the llfiuldatlon of |3,oo(i.ooo In loans 13
smaller than thÂ» known operation* of the
past week calle.l for. The. a.Mition of 13.000.000
to $50u.O<j<i of cash reserve, despite the loÂ«Â« of
IZ.OOO.OiK) of cold on I)eceml>t'r 16. ,ia unex
pected; but th" treasury disbursements anil thn
rt>celpt of specie from the West Indies .1 weeK
hcii ivÂ» ni'ir* than counteracted the earlier
loss. The. exports of fpeoie to Europe Satur
day are not Included In the present statement.
â What bearing they will have on the next ex
hibit of the banks Is problematical. it Is quito
likely, however, that the opening of the new
year will witness â 1..- usual movement of funds
between this center and the Interior. Div
idend disbursements are bringing Into the
irarket a fresh supply of freÂ« currency.
The usual semi-annual disturbances Inci
dent to payments of this character are
now fully discounted. The changed condi
tion of affaira with respect to business over the
country UoÂ»-s not make for â  repetition, of the
Influx of Interior money to New York which
was so pronounced at this time last year, but
the rat-- .ju.-te.l on domestic ebcc^&nsa at Im
portant center? how that the tendency \e in
favor of New York. It will be recalled that
the rise In securities beginning In January had
its origin largely In the superabundance of
money flowing this way. -There ii no prospect
that the return this year will approach that of
last winter, for the simple reason thai the

CHRISTMAS SHOPPERS ENJOY
A BUSY DAY AT THE STORES
Christmas shopper* put In a busy day
yesterday and spent the last few hours
In Santa Clnus' cause In a way that will
bring happiness to many. No better show-
Ing of the prosperity of the year about to
close could have been madÂ© than by the
city shops yesterday with thodr aisles all
crowded with purchasers. Buyers were of
nil classes and conditions, all come to
gether with the charitable Christmas
spiritâ the desire to bring Joy to every
bodyâand to upend money. Even the
Mongolian residents caught the whiff of
love and charity in the atmosphere and
mlngle<l with the vast throng of tired
mothers, gleeful children. Jolly fathers,
happy grandparents and the big-hearted
bachelors and pretty maids, all brought
together with the same purposeâ the de
sire to buy something for some loved one.
At the Emporium the aisles were crowd
ed with a seemingly solid mass of human
ity, which led purchasers to declare that
all San Francisco was assembled there
until they visited "Will & Flnck's or Hale's
or O'Connor & Moffatfs. when that opin
ion was changed and in the estimation
of buyers It was decided that the entire
population of San Francisco waa out
purchasing Christmas presents.

PRIDE OF COAST ASSAILED
INDEPENDENCE OF THIS PORT
TAKEN AWAY.
ThÂ« moderate resolution that the tea
Importers of San Francisco have sent
to the Secretary of the Treasury in refer
ence to the sampling of all tea at New
York is only a faint indication of the ac
tual state of feeling here. More communi
cations will yet appear and the entire
Congressional delegation from California
will take an Interest in seeing that the
obnoxious order Is set aside, or so modi
fled that the tea examiners at San Fran
cisco, Chicago and St. Paul shall not be
supervised by New York. The resolution
of the local tea Importers was published
: in The Call yesterday. That simply re
quested the Secretary of the Treasury "to
ordÂ«sr the New York â¢ miner to send four
ounces of all teas passed by him to each
of the examiners at Chicago and San
Francisco and that said examiners be ln
â¢tructod to scrutinize the samples sent
them in the ramc manner as the New
York examiner 1b to do with the samples
sent him from other ports."
Charles B. Platt, the Paciflc Coast
member of the United States board of
tea experts and vice president of .i A.
Folger & Co., said yesterday: "As the
matter now stands the tea examiner In
NYw York Is to exercise his Judgment lr-
I respective of what â¢may bo the judgment
of any other or all the tea examiners of

and this state of affairs exists no explan
ation will have the effect of relieving the
minds of tho tea Importers of San Fran
cisco. The order has taken away 'ho in
dependence of the port of San Francisco

"The idea would sc-om to be. that thÂ»

cannot understand how it Is possible to
expect the New York examiner to select
samples cassed on by himself to send to
the board of experts, which might be on
the doubtful line, or which he thought
would render him liable to criticism Thin

THE OBJECT LESSONS TODAY
BAUD CONCERTS TO BE GIVEN
IN FIVE SQUARES.
Mayor Phelan went to the water front
during the lunch hour yesterday and ad
dressed a largo crowd of worklngmen at
the Mall dock. When he asked for the
opinions of those who were In doubt re
garding any of the points upon which he
had spoken, there was no response, but a
prolonged â¢ beer.
The Mayor directed his remarks mostly
toward the criticisms of the opponents of
the panhandle extension. He deprecated
the attempt made in Southern I'acinV
quarters to make It appear that there Is
some political motive underlying this bond
campaign. "Some of the arguments put
forth by the railroad's mouthpiece are
SO transparent that It would be folly to
waste time in replying to them." said the
Mayor. "The railroad's opposition Is all
in a nutshell. If the people of the Mis
sion have a park and have music on Sun
day, the residents of that section will not
have to pay 10 cents to go to Golden oate
I'ark. If the people wish to walk or ride
through a beautiful extended panhandle
they will also noi be required to pay their
dimes. There Is the whole cause of the
railroad's oppositionâ nates to lose
those limes and to pay Its share for im
provements. By way of relief, it abuses
all those who favor any public improve
ment or do anything except grant addi
tional franchises gratis to corporations."
A mass-meeting was also held at the
wire works and was addressed by Col

The Panhandle Is RE feet wide and the
natural contour of the land can be preserved
or for three blocks the grade can be lowered,
which In Itself would be no disfigurement.
but this Is a matter for after conrMeratlon.
Contractors for grading will be required to

The "conclusion" of the circular Is as
follows:
San Francisco enjoys the singular distinction
of bring the mi." lane American city that is
free of debt. A wise policy will keen her bo.
except as to those things which may poeslbly
be of such Immediate necessity as to warrant
her coin* Into debt for them. Itemember
that bonds always mean extravagance and
waste and nearly always lead to corruption.
In fact, to write the history of municipal
bonds In the United States would be to write
the history In large part of municipal cor
ruption. And It Is well to keep in mind ti.at,
once the bond mill Is started, nothlar I*
harder than to stop It. Let us. therefore, rf
solve that our city shall never so into debt
except for that which Is of such present Im
mediate necessity aa to give us no other al
ternative.

SANTA CLAUS VISITS
THE KIP ORPHANAGE
LITTLE TOTS MADE HAPPY BY
A BIG CHRISTMAS TREE.
Lady Managers Provide Generous
Entertainment for Children Upon
Whom Dame Fortune Has
Not Smiled.
More than a hundred little folk", whom
the dreaded reaper deprived of the foster-
Ing care that nature had destined to guide
them through life, had a bright ray of
sunshine break through the clouds yes
terday at the Maria Kip Orphanage. A
Christmas tree was prepared for the
parentless Inmates that would have glad
dened the heart of any youngster. There
was not alone the tree, with all Its glis
tening decorations and strings of popcorn,
laughing Jumplng-Jacks and other things
so Inseparable to the yuletlde festivities,
but heaped around it were great piles of
presents for the little ones upon whom
Dame Fortune had not lavished her
smiles.
The lady managers of the institution
state that Santa Clans has been unusually
good to the orphanage this year. From
all quarters came donations for the
Christmas celebration, and as a conse
quence the Joy of the unfortunate little
ones was far beyond expectations.
A great big tree wm placed in the main
vestibule of the orphanage. It reached to
the celling, and a few feet of the top had
to be cut off so that It could be placed
upright. The board of managers outdid
themselves In the preparations for the fes
tivities. They took ejitire charge of the
decoration of the tree, and their work was
nobly performed. Briefly, the tree was a
gem.
But few exercises preceded the distribu
tion of the, presents.. Four companies of
the old children sang Christmas carols as
they marched from the dormitories to the
Christmas tree. One of the most touching
features of the occasion was the exhibi
tion by the nursery contingent. The
diminutive tots sang one or two pretty
carols, and then their Joy at the scene
that confronted them conquered discipline
and they broke from the ranks and ran
about the Christmas tree In childish ec
stasy.
Rev. W. I. Kip was the master of cere
monies and distributed the Christmas gift?
to the children. It was through the ef
forts of the board of managers that many
liberal donations were made. The board
