The success of the bond election hns
been the means of making one man su
premely happy; and this one is Judgo P.
\V, Van Reynegom. The cause of thfl
Judge's Joy lies in thf fact that by perse
verance he accomplished what he started
out to do In IS>2. This was the removal
of the Jewish cemeteries In the Mission
and the converting of the grounds Into a
public park. Single handed and at first
by himself he commenced to agitate, for
the removal of the cemeteries. In this be
was bitterly oppos.d for somÂ»Â» time, but as
he represented to his opponents the ad
vantages it would be to the people residing
in the vicinity of the cemeteries to havm
them xemoved ho gained converts to his
views and ultimately succeeded. His next
Inception was to have the city purchase
the two blocks of land upon which thÂ«
cemeteries stood and turn them into a
public park.
In this the Judge was also opposed, and!
in ordÂ»-r to kill any chances that he might
have In accomplishing his purpose the
"monkey ranch scheme" was sprung. This
had the desired effect for the time being.
But when Mayor i'heian conceived the
panhandle Idea. Judgo Van Reyengom

K-jch a plan would be a diplomatic stroke
unfavorable to Franco and Russia. The

evening, which passed off in a whirl of
dances, music and gayety. In spite of the
chilling surroundings. The room smelled
of cotlln varnish. All around were recep

Undertaker Wolborn did not say.
When the tired dancers sought a mo

the ladles sat upon them, while the gen

hymn books. When the music started
again the deathboxe were shoved back
against the wall and the waltz would be

The supper was served at the ghostly
hour of midnight. The guests sat around
the room on caskets, while waiters with

QUAY FEARS AN
EXTRA SESSION
Thinks He Would Again
Be Turned Down.
ABOUT READY TO WITHDRAW
WOULD LIKE TO NAME A NEW
CANDIDATE.
Politicians Consider This Course Un
wise, as the "Insurgents" Are
Opposed to Any Machine
Candidate.
Special Dl!-ratf-h to ThÂ« Call.
PITTSBURG, Dec. 23.â Whether there
will be an extra session of the Pennsyl
vania State Legislature called to elect a
successor to Matthew S. Quay depends
entirely upon the United States Senate
regarding the seating of Quay on the cer
tificate of Governor William A. Stone,
who appointed him. Former Senator Quay-
Is at his home In Beaver, near here, He
was expected In Pittsburg to-day to con
fer with his lieutenants regarding the
selection of candidates for the new Legis
lature. He Is figuring now whether It
would be better to allow the matter to
go before an extra session of the present
body or take chance^ on the new Legis
lature, which will organize in January,
ISOL
It Is the general opinion In this State
that the United States Senate will refuse
to seat Mr. Quay and that an extra ses
sion of the Legislature will be called by
Governor Stone Just as soon as Mr. Quay
gives the word. Mr. Quay concedes that
if an extra session of the present Legis
lature is called he cannot be elected a.a
he Is no stronger now than he was be
fore the body adjourned.
It is his Intention, therefore. It Is said
by persons or. the inside, to withdraw
and put forward a candidate that will
be agreeable to him. Who this candidate
will be Is not known. No matter who
he may be if he is a State machine man
the ReDubllcan "Insurgents" will be
against him and It is doubtful If he can
be elected.
It is believed that Mr. Quay, with his
superior political sagacity and knowledge,
would not think of RoinÃ before either
the present Legislature or the people for
another term.
Quay men believe }t would d* much
easier for them to elect a man with the
constitute l
than to no Into a contest fÂ»r
of the m-xt Lf-glsUitur*- with th- Benator
shlp an an issue. They hold that the.

TROOPS FOR ALASKA.
One or More Additional Posts Likely
to B? Established.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 23â At the Cab
j met meeting to-day much of the time
was occupied by Secretary Wilson In d:-
cusslni? th* agricultural possibilities of
L Alaska. It may he decided to Increase
the number of troops In Alaska, on the
trround that the constantly Increasing
population demands additional protection.
Reports reaching the Oovernment Indicate
that the rush next year to Alaska, es
pecially to Cape Nome, will be large and
that more troops probably will be re
| quired. It Is likely one or more additional
I posts will be established, one doubtless at
: Cape Nome, hut none of the details have
yet been worked out.

"Those of you who realize how much
there Is at stake, how great the loss will
be If matters are allowed to proceed as
In the past, and how great the gain to all
individual Interests and to the State at
large If the fruit-growers can be Induced
to organize, should take this matter in
hand with a linn determination to win."

DISSATISFIED

For the Wreck.
Dlspateh to The Call.
LOS ANOKLBB, Deo. 29.â During the
day new facts In regard to the inquest
hold yesterday over the body of Engineer
David S. Johnson, whoso hand held the
throttle when the ill-fated Southern Pa
citic train left the Â»track at Pomona on
Christmas eve, have come to light. Coro
ner Holland is charged with endeavoring
to persuade the Jurors to insert a clause
in the- verdict exonerating the company,
.-<> as to make the verdict "satisfactory."
It. 8. Hanson, foreman of the jury, who
resides in LÂ«os Angeles, is much discon
certed over the way in which the investi
gation was conducted.
Regarding the inquest Hanson said to
day: "I know that the Coroner yesterday
started a line of questioning that Led
members of the Jury to believe that be
wanted to lind out aOOUt the cause of the
railroad accident as well as the cause of
the man's death. There were only four
witnesses. Two were railroad men, only
one ol whom saw the engineer after the
accident. One was a passenger, whose
testimony was worthless. J-rom these
facts 1 was not satisfied with the evi
dence. The Coroner made his little speech
and â¢â¢â â â¢ were left to our deliberations.
There was a glass door leading into the
hallway and some one was peeping
through this nearly all the time.
"We made a written request for morÂ«
witnesses. This the Coroner calmly read,
and then said in fulsome speech that wo
were not called upon to inquire into the
causes of the accident, because from the
evidence produced there was nothing to
show that any one had been to blame. 1
said that if he merely wanted to tell
where the engineer was killed that was
simple and the testimony of the conduc
tor was enough.
"When we were writing our request for
witnesses the careful watcher at the door
evidently thought that we were preparing
a verdict. When three of us had signed
the request for additional witnesses he
came with a blank and said: 'Gentlemen,
h.-re Ik the proper form on which to in
corporate your verdict.' I answered: 'We
are not preparing a verdict. Mr. Coroner.
We want more â¢ information.' I was
astounded when he said that the verdict
was not satisfactory: that we ought to
incorporate in it the statement that there
was nothing to show that drc^nsoil came
to his death I rough the culpability of
any one. This wo refused to do until
given an opportunity to investigate the
case intelligently."

FLOATING WRECK OF
SCHOONER SIGHTED
Believed That All Hands of an Un-
known Vessel Perished Off
Cape Hatteras,
NORFOLK. Va., Dec. 29.â The loss of
another vessel, probably during last Sat
urday night's storm off Hatteras. was re
ported here to-day by the British steamer
Ashlands from Galveston. The Aahlands
reports having passed the wreck of a bis
three-masted schooner forty miles oft
Hatteras. There was no sign of life and
nothing to Indicate the Identity of the ves
sel. So shipwrecked sailors have been
landed and the men must have gone down
with their ship. From the size of the
schooner it Is thought that she must have
carried a crew of at least ten men.
CAUSE OF MONTGOMERY'S
VISIT TO LIBERIA
Joint Move Is on Foot to Establish a
Boundary Line Between That
Country and France.
LONDON, Dee 30.â 1t has been learno.l
by a representative of the Associated
Press that the United States cruiser
Montgomery's visit to Liberia Is appar
ently the result of overtures made to
Washington by that republic. ThouÃh
the Hritish Government is In complete
Ignorance of the purpose of the Mont
gomery's visit the establishment of .i
coaling station in Liberia by the United
Mates is regarded as scarcely probabl<
as it is asserted that no Llberian port 1...-I
any facility for coaling, all of them being
opÂ«-n and -bound.
The Associated I'ress representative
learns, however, that â  far more Impor
tant step Is under consideration. It con
sists in a joint request on the part of the
l.nlted States and Great Britain to
France to define the boundary between
the territory she claims and that claimed
by Liberia,
This step is not yet decided upon, but
Great Britain only awaits the United
States, assent to become â  party to such
a step. It is alleged that Fran â¢ for
many years has been encroaching on Li
beria and It was only by a strenuous
effort by the United States that she was
prevented from appropriating a large slice
of Liberia in 1892.

ThÂ«Â« wlsdorh of th^ choice of Freeman as I

Freeman was at that time Jn tho line of i

Pears'
Pears' soap is
dried a whole
year. That's
why it lasts so.
it was already turning putrid. About a
thnusnml pounds wiuÂ« thrown overboard
while The vessel was at sea, and after her
arrival at Manila 4000 pounds more was
condemned by a board of survey and
thrown Into the sea.
The matter wins taken up by the author
ities at Manila and it la still under In
vestigation. The surgeons who accom
panied the vessel were under detail to
Manila, nnd when the vessel arrived there
they were resigned to duty in the islands.
The investigation properly belongs to the
Department of the I'aeific, which is In
the Islands, but It will probably be trans
ferred to this department If it be found
that the beef was unlit for the voyage
across the ocean. It may have been that
the facilities for the keeping of the meat
on board the transport were Inadequate
or that the meat went hail, as it some
times does even on the â¢â¢liners."
Nothing has been heard of the matter
at the headquarters of the Department of
California, except from the general tele
gram announcing the sickness of the men
received by department headquarters Just
after the transport roache-1 Manila. A
similar experience came near hotng re
ported from the transport Indiana on one
of her trips down to the islands with
troons. It was found Just before Â«ho ar
rive,] at Honolulu that a great deal of the
lÂ»eÂ«-f in her refricÂ«Tator had gone bad.
an.l fhe had to throw 15,0'>0 pounds of It
overbr.ard and purchase that amount at
Honolulu to tako Its place.
The fact that no report of the case has
been mnde to the headquarters here is
nlmo.n proof that the investigation In
Manila developed satisfactory evidence
regarding the si>oiltnc of the heef.
the Bixth Cavalry to some other post, and
the most likely one Is the Presidio.
There is a scheme on font, however, to
garrison the homo post as soon as possible
by a "home battalion" from each of the
regiments at the front. Nearly every
one in the Islands has three battalions
with it, and it la considered a good plan
to send one of these battalions from each
one home. It Is time for some of the
commands out there to return, for It is
held that two years in a tropical climate is
all that troops from a temperate zone can
Ft!*nd. Some of the commands have served
nearly that time now. so It is Eafe to say
the Infantry will commence to return
noun. It may be then that some of these
home battalions" will be the garrison of
the Presidio.

Find Evidence of
Her Guilt.
A CORONER'S Jury yesterday, In
the matter â¢of Mrs. Marcella
Caleb, who died in St. Mary' a
Hospital last Thursday from In
juries alleged to have been inflicted by
Mrs. Mary Gallagher, returned a ver
dict that the woman "came to her
death from Injuries received from
parties unknown." By what process
Of reasoning the intelligent Jurors
managed to arrive at such a conclu
sion It Is useless to conjecture. Ac
cording to the evidence, the unfortu
nate woman's injuries were either the
result of an accidental fall or they
were inflicted by Mrs. Walter Gal
lagher.
The statement dictated and signed by

for a new railroad from Salt Lake City
to San Francisco to break the monopoly
of the Southern Pacific. Mr. Miller has
been hero the past two days, occupying
a suite of rooms at the Auditorium. He
made a flying trip to Milwaukee, return
ing this afternoon. While not unwilling
to discuss the Nicaragua canal project, of
which he was one of the earliest advocates.
Mr. Miller positively declined to state the
reason of his visit to Chicago except to
say that he was "Interested In a trans
portation project." â¢
I A Dumber of mysterious meetings have
been <Id in Mr. Miller's rooms the past
two days*, and .1 of them have been per
sons representing seme of the largest
financial interests in the East and West
and In California.
One of them, who for obvious reasons
does not want his rame mail-.' public,
said:
"An independent railroad from Salt
Lake City to San Francisco has become a
public necessity and It will be built. Mr.
Miller has secured pledges of ample capi
tal to construct the road and put it Into
operation. It Is a fact now plainly ap

Th<> speaker was Introduced by Hon.
James G. Magulre and the first thing that
greeted him was a challenge from the bo

the Invitation on the ground that his
stay here was limited to a day. The East

he devoted considerable time to answering
questions propounded by the audience.
The nature of a number of them promot
ed him to remark that It appeared that
the â¢socialists formed the larger part of

W. B. Hlnchman. F. S. Cone, J. H. Tim
mons. H. W. Maass and E. M. Hunter It
has been suggested that Dr. Benjamin Ide
Wheeler, president of the University of |
California, who is said to feel a great in
terest in rowing and to be anxious to see
the sport taken up by the undergraduates
at the university, should be invited to
witness the race. The committee will fol
low the boats for the last mile or so of
the race, as their launch would not be
able to keep up with the barges for the ,
whole distance To while away the te
dium of waiting for the barges the mem
bers will hold outrigger skiff races on the
creek, E. B. Thorntng having challenged
the Juniors, who will probably be repre
sented by E. B. Hainan, whose time in
the club regatta on October 1 was 12 min
utes 57 --. > seconds; while Thornlng's was
13 minutes 12 seconds.
W. B. liinchmun. H. W. Haass, F. S.

porary kennels nave been built, and the
pack will be removed from Walter Ho*
bart'i place and housed In the new quar
ters next week. The kennels are on Wil
liam 11. Howard's land on the Crystal
Springs road, to the west of Ban Mateo.
Later on, when Frank J. Carolan, master
of bounds, returns from the Bast, the
kennels will be Improved. a letter recent
ly received from the master of the Ban
Mateo Hunt says that he will return
early In January, bringing; with him a
first-class huntsman, who hunted for sev
eral years In England and has been for
some time in the employ of the Toronto
Hunt Club. The master writes that he
bad hoped to bring back with him some
good hunters for the members of the club,
but has been disappointed In his arrange
ments for shipping them. He will, how
ever, come home with three or four good
horses. During his absence be has bunt
ed with man) of the Eastern club and
has derived several Idea* for raising and
benefiting the Ban Mateo Hunt. He will
also bring with" him a few good stud
hounds from Canada, which will be used
to Improve the local pack. There are at
present about seventy-five in the pack,
of which twenty-five couples are fit for
work and the rest are puppies about five
months old. The hounds are In charge of

of stiff fences. Not to make the going
too difficult, the top rail of the fences Is

the: demand for improvement.
m S wa? expected the election on the propositions
/ \ to issue bonds to provide the city with a com
plete <c\ver system, erect needed schooihouses
and a city and county hospital was carried in favor of
those measures by an overwhelming majority. Thus
every feature in the general plan for improvement sub
mitted to the people lias been approved, and ample
evidence has been given of the eagerness of the citi-
P"Â» begin a new era of municipal development and
true that the vote east in theÂ«e elections is but
ion of the total vote of the city, but it is fair
ssumc that the voters who stayed at home were
divided on the various questions in about the same
proportions as those who voted. At any rate it is
e\-ident that the citizens who take enough interest
in public affairs to go to the pnlls when there is no
party if?uc at stake are strongly in favor of the new
movement and are willing to bear the comparatively
slight cost which is needed to put San Francisco
among the foremost American cities in all the equip
ments of a modern municipality.
The people having voted for the ads, it now re
â¢nains for those in authority to sec that the work goes
forward with promptness and is carried on with
economy. There should be no scandals in any part
of the work. None of the delays and the jobs which
matked the construction of the City Hall and the still
uncompleted Hall of Justice should be tolerated in the
erection of the hospital and the schoolhouses, or in
the construction of the sewers and the opening of th
panhandle. A serious responsibility rests upon the
officials who arc to have charge of any portion of the
xvork, and that responsibility they will not be pcr
tnitted either to ignore or to shirk.
Rlf the enterprises now to be undertaken re carried
out in the right spirit and in the right war the pro
gressive movement <>i the city -vill rot end with their
completion. One pood work well done invariably
serves to prepare the way for another, but when a
policy of public improvement is turned am and
made to ?ervc for such jobbery as has marked the con
struction of almost ail our public works heretofore,
fron, Uk Gty Hall ,â d. Ferry D cp o<, .here ,ri,Â«
a ?pint of popular indignation which prevents any
further municipal enterprises for years to come
It js to be underwood therefore that the demand for
â¢ ...
improvement at this time means improvement in meth
ods of pubnc work as well as in other things. The
voters have done their share. They have intrusted the
otncials of the city with UrÃc sums of money and they
expect an hone* and efficient administration of the
trust. At present even- one is sanguine of the future.
All rejoice in the manifestation piven of the awak
ened spirit of civic patriotism, and it will go hard
with any one in authority who in carrying out the
work shall give the people occasion or cause for re
gretting their votes of confidence.

Glasgow, Scotland, has long been held up by ad
vocates of good government as an example of what a
city should be. Its principal boast was municipal
ownership of a splendid tramway system. Added in
terest was given to this recently by an anonuncement
in the dispatches that the contract for its new equip
ment had been let to a New York firm â an indication
that at least we have some good things on this side
of the water they haven't in Glasgow.

country and nothing of a postal savings banks system,
both of these subjects are being widely discussed and
both improvements will probably be urged upon Con
gress during this session.
The re: tatiofl for a postal savinps hank
hat bi-en largely stimulated by the recent expotUl

and the success which has already attended the ar
rangement for a parcels post with Germany affords a
strong argument in favor of it.
One of the defects of the present postal law is the
opening given for abuses of the privilege of sending
certain articles as second class mail. It is said if that
t can be remedied it wiH be possible to provide a
cheap pa: without loss to the Government.
As the Postmaster General has strongly recommended
the passage ..f the Loud bill, designed to restrict
mail privileges to those who are rightly
entitled to them, it is probable something may be
plished to establish a parcels post.
The people Â« glad to have both the parcel
post and the savings banks, for there is no re

TUT. necessity for having sea power has heen much
discussed in this country, where the example of
England is highly regarded. The exertions of
Germany to advance the class of her navy are now
of interest in England.
The Kaiser has recently indicated a new use for a
universally distributed navy. In a statement about
Samoan affairs the war lord said that Samoa must
be German because years ago a German warship was
wrecked at Apia. This idea that title to a land is ac
quired by wrecking a ship on its coast is hardly more
whimsical than that other appeal to pseudo patriotism
about hauling up or hauling down the flag as evidence
of right and title.
The Westminster Gazette, discussing from an Eng
lish standpoint the increase in the German and Rus
sian navies, r;)i<rv, exactly the same question that
troubled the mind of the Czar as to land armaments.
The Gazette Bays: "Two years tiro it was considered
sufficient that we should l>e superior on the seas to
France and Russia. Now we are faced by, a sudden
access of competition. Russia is largely incr
her Heet; Germany and the United States have, each
em, plans f<>r an entirely new lleet. Can we count
either of the newcomers as allies in the sense that wre
ran disregard their effort- 5 Mr. Chamberlain's Lekes
| eech scarcely eno 5 the idea. We may
be friends with them for ;i particular purpose and at a
: price, but permanent fricnd-h.ii>. which would
enable us to write off their forces from the number of
ble enemies, is clearly not within our reach.
Since the present Government came into power .ye
have had dangerous quarrels with each of them, and
ne dare say, however much we may wish it. that
we may not again have acute differences with one or
them. What then? Must we g >
building till we are mined, in the vain hope of meet
ing all possible combinations against us. or must we
the balance of sea power to he altered to our
Dtage? We answer for ourselves that the sec
ikefnative is inevitable, and that we ought not to
let it alarm n* unduly."
Thi- brings into plain view the final result of de
voting all the resources of civilization to the building
up of military power on land and There comes
a time when the burden breaks the back that carries
it and falls, taking with it every advantage which it
was supposed to secure.
It i- not .i new matter. The same i^stie was as acute
a century and a half ago. Its existence was one rea

States, understood l>y its builders to be a protect
nrope, where nai ted only in the

justified, ne.irly a hundred years ago, in saying that
:ountry should pursue the happiness of its pc >-
pie on a line opposed to the hell of war and ambition
that ruled Europe, how much more are we justified
in keeping to our old lines, now that that hell is im
posing burdens that stagger the nations which bear
them.
- If the opinions of the Westminster Gazette had
been more generally accepted a year ago in this
country and Europe the Peace Conference might have
been a success instead of a failure. It might have been
a new base line from which to measure the policy of
the nations instead of a conventicle ko nerveless that
it could not even agree to debrutalizie war by outlaw
ing missiles which torture and putting the ban upon
the murder of helpless prisoners and wounded com
batants.
If it had been then more clearly understood that
the policy of added armaments to dominate the world
by land and sea means in the final analysis that the
strongest must go on building until ruined, th's

A commission of three has beeen appoint
ed to examine the district and report some

is to build additional streets and make
other improvements. The line of work
will depend almost wholly upon the find

The Government's idea is to make the

Students of languages from the groat

Philological Association of the Pacific
Coast. A temporary organisation was ef
fected by the election of Professor Ed

part of yesterday's session was occupied
in the reading of papers on philological
subjects by eminent professors and stu
dents of the West. The permanent organ
ization and the election of otllcers Is to
take place this afternoon.
The idea of forming the association
originated primarily with the Stanford
Society, the suci-eas of which attracted
attention among the faculties of the coast
colleges. At a meeting of the University
Greek dub held In December, ISSS. it was
decided to take steps to organize a soci
ety for the study of the classic languages.
A committee consisting of Professors
Ernest M. Pease of Stanford. Elvyn F.
Hurrill of the Oakland High School and
Edward B. Clapp of the University of Cal
ifornia was appointed to arrange the de
tails, It was determined to make the
scope of the organization greater than at

and Stanford discussed the subject and
the idea of forming a coast association
was the result.

DE PACHMANN S
THIRD RECITAL
DE PACHMANN'S third recital was
in mom respects the best he has
given. It had its deficiencies as
well, of which more farther on.
What was most Important was the fact
that at one point In the programme yes
terday afternoon the pianist aroused more
real enthusiasm than at any previous
time. There has not been much sincerity
in the approval hitherto accorded him.
the applause generally being rather weak
and not of that spontaneous, uncontroll
able kind that some of the truly great are
capable of arousing, It is small wonder
that De Pachmann has not been more
generous of encores, for it must have been
I quite evident to him that the disturbances
in the auditorium were but perfunctory
plaudits, contributed largely by the
claque. Yesterday, however, he won ap
plause that was as Mattering as it. was
i real, and, I may add, it was richly de
served.
There was a liberal offering of Chopin in
the programme, and De Pachmann s ex
cellence in the works of that composer,
although repeated until it has becomo
wearisome, is not the le.-Â»s a fact. Yet
right here 1 wish to make a reservation.
1 â¢â¢â¢ Pachmann excels as an interpreter of
Chopin, but he doe* not play everything
by Chopin well. After hearing him re
peatedly l am forced to conclude that he
neks the necessary spirituality to bring
out certain qualities that are primarily
responsible for the charm, the spell, the
appeal of Chopin's music.
ills reading of the llrst nocturne yester
day was demonstrative of this fact. It
was technically admirable, a model of
phrasing and color, but there was not In
It the heart quality, the poetic depth, the
dream. In the Fantasia (Chopin), op. 43
he played deliriously and with the utmost
ilnesse. There were rare touches of deli
cacy In the above mentioned Nocturne,
and again in the Impromptu, op. 29, but
It was in the Mazurka, on. 7, and VaNe
No. 1 that the qualities of brilliance and
grace were paramount. These two num
bers were the gems of the afternoon and
would argue D*Â» Pachmann, if not an Ideal
player of Chopin, at least an Interpreter
of that composers dance music who can
not be equaled or even approached
The final numbers were not happy ex
cepting the Valse Caprice (Schiibert-
I.lszt), which was played admirably. The
I'erpetuum Mobile (Wei.er) has an Inter
est, but It always reminds me of a race
with a metronome. De Pachmann's purity
of tone was heard to advantage in the
Pollaccn Brilliant (Weber, op. 72). but the
comoosition is rather tedious than other-

SCHUFELDT TO BE
COURT-MARTIALED
Sequel to the Captain's
Divorce Case.
Special r>tÂ»pÂ»tch â¢
WASHINGTON Dec. 23.â The War De
partment has accepted the challenge of
Captain R. W. Scbufeldt. U. 8. A., retln I,
and has trnnsmitt'-d all the papers refer
ring to the case of the officer to Major
General Merrltt. commanding the Depart
ment of the East, at New York, for court
martial proceeding*.
Several days ago the Mutant general,
by direction of the Secretary of War. or
dered Captain Schufeldt to place himself
within the Jurisdiction of the civil court*
of Maryland, before which that oaicer
was the- defendant in divorce proceed
ings. This order was based on reprcuenta.
tlons of the attorneys of the wife of tho
officer that he had failed to comply with
the orders of thÂ« court for the pa>m> :.:
to his wife of a Â»tat< amount of alimony
and that ho remained outside the Juris
diction of the Stale court In order to
evade process.
Subsequently the officer's counsel in
formed the War Department that, acting
on his advice. Captain Schufeldt would
decline to comply with the order to place
himself in the Jurisdiction u< the court.
The attorney said he based his advice on
the fact that his client recently had been
declared bankrupt by the courts of the
District of Columbia, and consequently
was relieved from the payment of the ali
mony decreed by the Maryland court,
amounting to date to about I6W. A com
pliance with the orders of the War De
partment, the attorney said, undoubtedly
would lead to Captain Schufeldt's impris
onment without proper cause. The attor
ney furthermore declared the proceeding
was a scheme on the part of the prosecu
tion to put his client Into prison, and said
that Captain Schufeldt would stand the
consequences of court-martial proceeding*
rather than obey the order, which virtu
ally meant his Incarceration without legal
support.
Captain Schufeldt also wrote a letter lo
the Secretary of War protesting against
the action of th military authorities and
notifying him that he must decline to obÂ»y
the order to placo himself within the Jur
isdiction of the Maryland courts. HÂ«? told
the Secretary' that he had been under mil
itary arrest for more than a year and th it
ho considered the order Issued In his ca.Â«<>
as unreasonable, as it would be one which
would require him to cormnll murder or
some other crime.

THE SAN FKANCISCO CAT/L, SATURDAY, DECEMBEE 30. 1899.
I presented a written opposition by Carrie
Bweifert, a granddaughter, to Utter.- of
! adriiinlstratlon being granted to Jonathan
bweiKcrt.
! It states that Adam Swclgert died at
Sun Francisco on November 8, 1899 leav
ing an estate valued at $250,000: that de
j ceased was s9 â  â¢ an of age, and for Â«cv
i eral years prior to his di-ath he had been
feeble In body, weak in mind and wholly
; unable to tend to his business: that from
March 1. IS>97. Jonathan Sweigtrt and his
family lived with deceased and that Jona
than Swt'igort received and collected all
the rents and profits of the estate. From
March L 1897, to February 1, 1899, the rents
and prollts amounted to between $I^oo and
JIN*) per month, and from February 1.
ISO*, to the time of the death of the de
ceased they amounted to about $1000 per
mr.nth. It Is stated that Jonathan Bwel
p*-rt Is not competent to serve or act .is
executor of Fald estate because of the
want of Integrity. It declares he took an
undue- advantage of the feeble and weak
condition of his father and the latter'a
confidence and reliance for the purpose of
fraudulently obtaining the money and
property of the deceased and for the pur
pose of depriving other devisees and leva
teei <if the interest and share they wire
entitled to. Jonathan Sweigert is also ac
cused of poisoning his father's mind
against the others and fraudulently rep
resenting that they did not care for him.
and that it was necessary that his (Jona
than Swelgert's> family should live with
him 1 <-> properly care for testator, and that
the whole of the nts nnd profits, after
payment of Insurance and taxes, were
required for nil (the testator's) care and
support.
Tt ir ohnrged that between March 1. 1577.
and February 1. 1899, Jonathan Sweigert
appropriated $23,000 received as rents and
profits to his own use, and from February
1, 1898, to the time of the death of the
testator the further sum of &000, making
a total of ?25.000.
In January. 1899, Johnathan Swelgert.
the opposition declares, falsely represent
ed to his father that the rents and profits
were Insufficient for his (the father's)
support and that it was necessary to sell
a building and lot on Kearny street, near
Po*t. in San Francisco. This building and
lot was included in the will anil given to
; all the devisees and heirs. The price paid
for the building was 197,500. and Johna
thnn Swelgert is charged with appropriate
All Excellent Combination.
! The pleasant method and beneficial
effects of the well known remedy,
STBtn of Figs, manufactured by the
California Fio Syrup Co., illustrate
the value of obtaining the liquid laxa-
tive principles of plants known to be
medicinally laxative and presenting'
them in the form most refreshing to the
iaste and acceptable to the system. It
is the one perfect strengthening laxa-
tive, cleansing the system effectually,
dispelling colds, headaches and fevers
gently yet promptly and enabling one
to overcome habitual constipation per-
manently. Its perfect freedom from
every objectionable quality and sub-
stance, and its acting on the kidneys,
liver and bowels, without weakening
or irritating them, make it the ideal
laxative.
In the process of manufacturing figs
are used, as they are pleasant to the
taste, but the medicinal qualities of the
remedy are obtained from senna and
other aromatic plants, by a method
known to the California lie Syrup
Co. only. In order to get its beneficial
effects and to avoid imitations, please
remember the full name of the Company
printed on the front of every package.

Artistic Posters That Are Worth
Having.
The poster collecting crnze 'Is Just as
strong as ever. Often high prices have
been paid for those of exceptional merit.
The same also holds true of calendars for

XILâ ECONOMIC BUYING OF
FOOD.
Many Americans hesitate to practice
economy, lest they be considered mean or
stingy; but It la only wise expenditure (f
money which is economic. "A veneration
for costliness Is one of the vulgar vices."
said Mattieu Williams, and we require
education before we are convinced that
a cheap article is not always a mean
one. On the other hand, we must be able
to see when the best is really the cheap
est.
When purchasing clothing we know that
its wearing qualities must be taken Into
consideration, and that It should be adapt
ed to \ho hi as<in, but we seldom apply the
same reasoning to our foods. Yet some
food supply much more nutrition than
others even at the name price, and our
diet should be varied us radically a* our
clothing with the changing of the season.
The average buyer of foods merely cal
culates the cash available to see whether
It admits of the purchases which eye and
palate crave. The economic buyer als3
estimates the human effort which will be
required to put the foods upon the table,
for time should be expended ar>
fully as money. Some housekeepers spend
time and perhaps car fare In golns; to a
flistant market when tiny could !>â¢â¢ an well
served nearer home for v very taw cents
additional.
in some rasrii it li cheaper to bur hign
prlced foods than t" pay for servlo or to
wn strength to prep i
pensive articles. Housekeepers of moder
ate means frequently Bud it wiser to boy

dom made at in. me. and if bakeries Were
and kÂ»iÂ»t up to
a hi^h standard we should be
served t>y them than we arc with the
:i\ erags bome>made bn ad.
True economy, therefore. lies in using
our lncomÂ« in such a way as to get the
most out of It under our own conditions.

.me household It is not difficult to
estimate the amount of these bills for the
month or quarter In advance. There .ire
certain supplies which are as essential
to the family table as Is water, and the
quantities and bills for these will vary
so little from month to month that they
have been termed "constants." Such are
fl'jur and other cereal rr"ducts,
tea. coffee, butter and milk. Whether
flour should be bought by bag or barrel
depends upon the capacity of the family
for bread-eating. Where other < â 
are used less tluur is required. As a rule
it Is wiser not to keep large quantities
â  if r. real foods on hand, as they grow ran

THE DEATH OF ROSS
Teamster Oven Saw the Car Coming
His Way, but Disregarded the
Danger Signal.
An Inquest was yesterday held by a
Jury summoned t>v CorotMf Hill t"
mine the fWII of the death of Simon P.
Ross, the fruit pedd)Â«r who was Injured
whllfl riding on the dummy of an electric
car that collided with â  truck at the
crossing of Third and Harrison fl-andf l
and a verdict mi rendered declaring that
the man's death whs accidental and was
the result Of blood poisoning following
the amputation of his leg,
No blame was attached to any one, hut
the testimony showed that the collision
mi the direct result of an attempt on
rt of William Oven, driver fur
the Ov< rland Transportation Company, to
beat the car acroae th.- track, regardless
of thÂ»- warnings of the tlasman at the
crossing. Henry P. Rothman, driver for
th<- (}'-i.rK<' H. Tay Company, who wit-
I the accident, testified that It whs
customary for driven to disregard th.Â»
flagman's signals and take their chances
In getting across ahead of th- car which
approached Third street on a heavy down
grade.
Oven admitted that he did not look up
the inn before starting acrora, and that
whin he saw thai the cur was close upon
him. Ins/cad of pulling up and swinging
his teai the track, be kÂ«i>t going
ahead.
Secretary Clayton of the San Francisco
and Pan Mateo Company testified that
the gni'le at that point was 14 2-.

such price should be uÂ»ed freely as a sub
stitute for meat. During the winter
months they arc to be omitted from tho
menu and will be all the more desirable,
when they are Main abundant.
Meat! In all isectlons of the land aro
costly foods, though In the West they aro
much less expensive than in the East. If
a family li small It la not economy to buy
large Joints, and even small pieces of tho
tougher sections will require long cooking
and therefore considerable fuel to render
them palatable. The truest economy in
purchasing meats comes from the ability
to Bee such bargains as may be found la
almost any market.
The actual amount of nutrition in any
piece of meat is not always measured by
Is cost or weight. The relative propor
tion of edible and non-edible substance
must be estimated. An expensive roast
contains much fat and bone, and thÂ© ac
tual meat may be no more nutritious than
an equal weight from the round or neck,
which would cost not half as much per
pound. Tripe, heart, liver and the like
are cheap forms of animal food and when
carefully prepared afford variety. Beef
and mutton must be the main dependence
of the economic buyer; veal and lamb fur
nish leal nutrition in proportion to their
wdght. Pork is a cheap meat and m . lV
be used In moderation if carefully select
ed. Fish should bo more generally used
than it is. but sony; varieties are much
more substantial than others. It a not
necessary to provide as large a quantity
of salmon as of co.l. for the former Is
richer In fat and more satisfying; more
over, the cod, though much cheaper than
the oalmon. will have a larger proportion
of skin, bone and other uneatable mate
rial. Shell fish are decidedly cxpenalvo
In proportion to the nutrition they con
tain. A pound of lobster Is by no means
a pound of meat. Professor Atwater's
analyses show that a quart of oysters
costing from M to +) tents afford little If
any more nutriment than a quart of milk
costing one-flfth as much.
Poultry" is jjencrally considered an ex
pensive food, and there Is a considerable
proportion of non-edible matter, but at 12
to i". cents a pound it will compare favor
ably with Other meats.
Cheese Is not approclated by American*
as It is In other lands wher* meat Is Ips-3
abundant. Pound for pound average?
cheese contains about twice as much nu
trition of the vnmc kinds as does meat,
and yet Is practically free from refuse.
Therefore those who must live on moder
ate Incomes '1., well to use cheestÂ» In com
bination with other foods. Macaroni with
cheese affords the same kinds of nutri
ment as potatoes and meat.

A varied supply of condiments Is essen
tial to the housekeeper who would feed
her household economically. Herb*,
spices, catchups, curry powder and celery
salt all have their place in Riving variety

main dependence.

ciples necessary for complete nutrition.
yet they are mainly water. It Is rarely
economy to buy such foods out of season,
and even when most abundant It Is wiser
to buy small lots, because, of their perish
able nature. Canned fruits have their
place, and some should always be kept on
hand for emergencies. Dried fruits aro
cheaper than canned and quite as satis
factory If properly prepared. Such of
these as suit the family taste may bo
bought by the case.
Statistics prove that half the Income of
the average family goes for food, the pro
portion decreasing as the income in
creases. Every family can decide for It
self the amount which shoal I be spent
for this purpose. The buyer must then
use the specified sum in such a way as to
produce good resultsâ that Is, satisfy tho
family notions and at the same time give
the nutrients required. An average ration
requires for each man per day sixteen
ounces of meat and fish, fourteen ounces
of flour and cereals, two ounces of butter
and fat. four ounces of sugar, sixteen
ounces of fruit and vegetables and eight
ounces of milk. Though more definite
figures are. required before we can be sura
of â  balanced ration, IMS HI some guldu
to the buyer who would be economic. Tho
monthly bills should be rearranged to
show whether one type of food la being
provided In excess and another In too lim
ited quantity.
A variety of food substances Is needed,
and these may be procured In cheap or ex
pensive forms, whichever our purses war
runt.

Bradstreet's Annual Review.
NHW YORK. Dec. 29.â Rradstreet's review of
"The Year In Buaineea" to-morrow will pay:
Karely have !>ant;ulnÂ«- commercial and finan
cial hopes or predictions found men adequate
realization as they 'lii during MM Certainly
nothing like the widespread and general up
ward movement of values, alike of staples and
of Kwuritlejj. such as occurred during this year,
could have been foreseen. Linked with an Im
mense business and a 1 breaking produc
tion In nearly all lines of business and Indus
try, except, perhaps, in conic products of the
agricultural interest, there was with it an ad
vance of ttaiile ... either of which alone
would have made the year notable, and, com
bined, to have served to establish the year as a
record-breaker and set up new standards. The
volume of domestic and of foreign trade alike
was the larcÂ»*Â«-t ever recorded and the .bank
clearing, rvllcctlng immense business expan
sion, ai'tive simulation in mocks and Immense
new industrial Boatlnga, far surpassed all pre
vious records. I'rlctrs, an a result, primarily,
of tl;e stimulation proceeding from supply and
demand conditions, scored probably the great
i-ht advance in any single year and brought thÂ«Â»
general level of Maple values to the highest
point ri ached tor more than eight years peat.
Failure statistics point to the smallest number
reported for seventeen years past. These re
fults have come to pass in the face of a con
rlderably lessened production of wheat and an
inmense fnlllnc >'ft In the yield of cotton.
In Industrial affairs the year has been one of
enontioufi expansion. Certainly nothing like the
general advance in waKÂ»-s of industrial em
ployes has In-en witnessed in many years, and
tliif> has been accomplished with a minimum of
friction.
The ciose of the year finds order books filled to
from three to six months ahead In nearly all
lines. Distributive trade was naturally of Im
mense volume throughout the year, though
mild weather at the close tended to modify the
ratisfactlon with which retail trade in winter
fabrics was regarded. This was, however,
partly compensated for by a holiday business
yurpa^ir.B nil previous records. Notwithstand
ing smaller exports of agricultural products
during the calendar year, breadstuff shipments
J^tnÃ 14 par rent smaller, tattle .and hogÂ» 12
per cent less, and cc.tlon shipments, owing to
til- short crop, r.t least IS percent leas, there whs
such an expansion In our manufactured export!
th.it the entire export trade of the rear will con
elderably exceed that of the last calendar year,
which was the heaviest recorded, and " will
make the year no less notable In the line of
foreign than In domestic trade, with a total of
exports flrtle less -..I!. $1.2*0.000,000â an aggre
gate which, if reached, will mark a gain of 3
|.er cent over the record total of ISSB. Imports
have naturally shown â  marked revival, and it
Hie gain fur the eleven months Is maintained for
the month of Decetaber a total of a little be
low $vx\noo,ooo may be expected, which would
suaran'ee a total foreign trade well In' excess
of $2,ooo.rnc.ofiftâ an amount. It 'might be re
marked, never before equaled. As to exports
it Is to be noted that nearly a third ot all are
manufactured products, a proportion never be
fore reached; and as to imports, the heavy In
crease in raw products Intended for manufac
ture bears testimony to the activity of domes
tic Industry.
The apparent trade balance In our favor,
though not as heavy as in IS9S. will still ag
gregate an enormous amount.
That the advance In the price of staples has
not been a fictitious one, or based upon arbi
trary actions of combinations, is evidenced by
the fact that ,i similar price movement has
been Witnessed abroad the general level of
prices in England, for Instance, being higher
on December 1 this year than for more than
eight years rust. The course of values, too,
has been in accordance with the expectations
of economists In that the greatest relative rise
has been in manufactured goods or In products
of Industry, not exclusively agricultural. Bread
stuffs alone of all the classes of staples are act
ually lower now than they were a j ear ago, the
dttltne be'nz about 6 per icnt. On the other
hand; the maaufactured or partly manufactured
products, such as metals, raw and manufac
tured t"x^:--. building material, coal and naval
stores., have scored remarkable gains. Metals
as a whole wer.e 'A per cent higher than .i year
ago, due. largely, of course to the. i ward rush
of iron and bteel prices, which have all prac
tically di led In value within the year. Haw
cotton and wool have made especially notewor
thy advances, and from being among the most
depressed of industries the textile manufacturing
trades have become among the busiest there is
record of. Other textiles have ..r>- 1 in this
advance, and the result is that textiles as a
class are a third higher than a year ago. Coal
and coke have shared in the wonderful indus
trial development of the year, with a rise equal
to that In textiles, an.i building materials, too,
have made e<;ual gall's, owing mainly to the
marked advance in lumber. Naval at' re*
Showed a gain of nearly a third in price. Hided
and leather are a fourth higher. Livestock,
dried fruits and oils are an eighth higher, anil
provisions, chemicals and miscellaneous prod
ucts have all advanced.
Taking bank clearings as an Index, the out
look at present favors a total at the country's
clearing houses, making a comparison with
previous years, of 74 per cent over 1&97 and of
51 per cent over 1592. while as compared with
1594 the volume of clearings has practically
doubled. Active stock speculation and Immense
industrial floatlngs, but above all enormous
trade and industrial activity, naturally swelled
the volume of clearings in the Middle States,
but the gain* in the New England group, in
cluding Boston, where copper-share speculation
was extensive, and where are the great manu
facturing centers, were also considerable. The
largest monthly clearings up to December were
reported In March, while outside of the metrop
olis the heaviest totals were shown as late as
October. The flurry In money late In December
swelled the weekly bank clearings to an un
precedented sum. making possible an exception
ally heavy December aggregate. Decreases from
liSS at individual cities were few and due
mainly to changes In methods unconnected with
the generally large business done. As com
pared with 1>94. every city In the country nat
rally reports larger clearings, but it Is worth
noting that thirteen cities In all show decreases
from the year I>S2, which still remains at these
cities a year of unequaled trade. The rail
roads of the country bays; done the heaviest
business In their history, proved by the gains In
gross and net receipts over all previous records.
That the transportation interests are deter
mined to share still further In the unexampled
volume of tonnage offering Is proved by the
general advance in rates scheduled for January'
1. 1900. I illroad building, th >ugh mostly of
branches and feeders, was the heaviest re
ported since 1590. ' was double the average of
the preceding four years and 50 per cent larger
than In 1898.
The record of embarrassments has fceen of a
steadily diminishing scale as regards number
and even in liabilities the year's record is an
exceptional one. and were it not for a few large
failures In the last two months of the year
that period as a whole would have been fairly
entitled to the appellation of phenomenal.
Though the year's record Is not as yet complete,
and the returns as to assets and liabilities are
still more or less ... it may be stated that
the total number of failures, based upon com
plete returns for eleven months and partial re
turns for December, will be In the neighborhood
of 9550, certainly little In excess of that num
ber, a total smaller than In the preceding year
by 17 i>er cent. 'i>\ per cent fewer than in IX'7.
36 per cent lower than in 1836, 25 per cent
(â mailer than In ISSG or 1894 and 40 per cent less
than In 1893, the year of panic. As compared
with 188 there is even shown a decrease of 6
per cent and the number of failing traders,
firms or corporations Is in fact the lightest
since iÂ»iÂ«2. As regards liabilities, while the
showing Is not bo good as expected, there is a
reasonable hope of the aggregate not being
much In excess of $120,000,000, which would be
15 per cent less than In I*%. 23 Â»er cent smaller
than in 181 51 per cent leys than in 1596, 70 per
cent smaller than In the panic year, lv? 3.l v ? 3. and
only 11 per cent more than in 1893, a year of ex
ceptionally good trade. The return of normal
conditions Is Indicated by the percentage of
assets, which may aggregate JS::.00O.O<V) to liabil
ities, being only 51.6. as against 52 per cent
last year. 54.3 per cent In 1887, 59.9 per cent in
iv:< 6, 65 per cent in 1V33 and i*) per cent In 1892.
The percentage of those falling in business, too,
will show a marked shrinkage and will be
among the lowest ever reported, the probabili
ties favoring a percentase of .OOSS this year,
against .016 per cm last year. .fil2o In 1Â«.?7.
.0170 In ISS3 and .Ol^i per cent In 1552, the small
est percentage In fact since ISS2.
That the Improvement in business has made
itself felt at last In all parts of the country is
Indicated by the Southern and Pacific States
groups showing the largest decrease In failures
from a year ago, fully one-third In each case.
The business community looks forward to 1900
with at least equally mixed feelings of hope
find confidence.
Bradstreet's Financial Reziew.
N;:w FORK, 1- -s review of
â 
After the storm of the preceding week this
one haÂ« seemed a decided calm. While the
movements of prices have been irregular, they
have been mainly in the direction of Improve
ment. and there has been an entire absence of
liquidation or other tendencies which had so
alarmed Wall street. Kast Saturday's ban i
statement, while not as Rood a one as had been
hoped tor was nevertheless favorable, and It
was also evident that the strain ui>on the
money markrt had been removed by the action
of th- Treasury and the New York banks. It
would Indeed seem that the money has been
under firm control and thai financial Interests
of the largest caliber were determined that no
further disturbance should be allowed while the
preparations for the January disbursements
were in progress. Call money this week has
not been abovu 7 per cent, and at the Stock
Exchange lower rates have been quoted on
large transaction?. Time money, however, m
ot at all plentiful, and most . commission
houses hesitate about supplying themselves
at a C per tent rate, which is now the mini
mum. The Improvement In the money situation
here had its counterpart In the better feeling at
Ix>ndon. which market apparently owes Its
more cheerful tone to the fact that further gold
shipments to the amount of some M.3. p .d."<Hi are
beitiK mnde to It from Ne* York to-day. The
indifference with which the firmness of ex
cbaoge and the gold exporting operations were
regarded by the market was another feature of
the week. There were no other factors of spec
ulative importance, bat with the removal of the
pressure to sell stocks there was an apparent
reaction of sentiment, which favored higher
values throughout the list. Fresh buying by
tin- public has not developed as yet. The bear
Interests, however, covered extensively, and
lÂ«>ols and large operators found little opposition
to marking up the prices for their special)
This process was plainly noticeable in the steel
stocks and other industrials. The railroad
â hare list was, however, relatively the most
active part of the market, both the standard
dividend payers and the low-priced stocks
Fhowlng sharp advances. The voJame of busi
ness, however, showed â  decided reduction and
despite the bullish manipulation Just referred
to the general disposition of the street was to
allow the market to become quiet. in the hopÂ«
that the enormous disbursements on January 1
amounting to at least 1200,000,000. will develop
caster money and a renewed Investment and
speculative demand for securities. On Friday
the market was narrow but generally strong
Bradstreet's on Trade.
NSW YORK. Dec. .â Rradstreet's to-mor
row will say: Holiday influence and stock
taking imparts an â¢ appearance of dullness to
general distributive trade, broken, however,
by fair activity In reordered buslneea to nil
up stocks depleted by the heaviest holiday
trade that has ever been experienced.
Anticipation of spring trade wants has Riven
a more than ordinarily active appearance to
buslneax In dry (foods at New York, while In
industrial lines the effort* of manufacturers
to keep up with filled order books Is resulting
in unusually active Operations. Following the
flurry In money and stocks and in some lines
of speculative commodities note.] last week has
come, as was expected, a more cheerful tone
and a firmlr.K up in quotations Ix noted In such
staples Â»- cotton, which was affected by last
week's money developments and also in hog
products. oc.Tee. copper, tin and lead.
The failure of cotton receipts to Increase has
been a source of strength In that market,
more especially as the break recently is un
derstood to have afforded an opportunity to
heavy short covering by foreigners. Aside from
these features prices have displayed excep
tional firmness, cereals holding up especially
well.
The Ftrcngth of textiles is still a feature
which finds Justification in current statistics
of large receipts and sales of wool and In re
ports of enlarged old and heavily Increased
new capacity In manufacturing lines. Another
example of tail la found in the fact that ai
t h*>ut; 1> wool recelpta at lUiKt on forlh* yÂ«-ar
aggregate nearly double those of a year ago
the stock held at the close of the Â»-ear is
actually smaller than at the end of IÂ«3S. One
of the last of the manufactured textiles to
feel the impetus of expanding demandâ cotton
threadâ has this v.â-v. been advanced.
800 l and shoe statistics point to an increase
of shipments from Boston of 400.000 cases over
the preceding year, and although recent mild
weather has dulled thÂ«Â» demand the outlook in
this trade and in hides and leather Is of con
siderable strength.

Dun's Review of Trade.
NEW YORK D< R. 0 Dun I
Week!] â¢
No correct report of failures In ISM can be
made until th..- year has closed. A collapse of
speculation In copper stocks has swelled the ag
gregate at Boston alone over $18,000,000 within
a few days and might yet add to the record.
The failures reported are fewer In number than
any year since â â¢3 and smaller In amount of
commercial liabilities than in any year since
I<Wl. The aggregate of defaulted liabilities Is
Jl2O.ieo.oCO, but nearly two-thirds of the bank-
Ing liabilities were added within a few days,
the aggregate reaching about 1^.&00.0v.'. The
commercial liabilities have buen about JS3,2CÂ£>.
000, though exact returns for a few recent fail
ures are not yet obtainable.
No other years, except â¢:. with defaulted
liabilities cf 155.932. and ISSO. with (K.TU,
000, have failures been as small -since the.
agency commenced quarterly returns in I*"*.
Th..- average of liabilities per failure Is less
than INOO. the smallest In any year of the
twenty-fiveâ a gratifying evidence that com
mercial liabilities are further removed than
usual from the point of danger.
The week has been exciting only at Boston,
where the failures growing out of speculation
and the efforts to re-establish banks and tlnns
suspended have not given the week a holiday
character. Yet general business is thoroughly
safe and prosperous, and no Important firms
have failed, save Eume which were individually
connected with concerns Involved In specula
tion.
The rpeculative troubles come because the
volume of legitimate business and the unprece
dented distribution of profits, interest and divi
dends, made it no longer possible to carry some
stocks on borrowed money. Prosperity, itself,
placed a check on sl>eculatlve features.
Wheat and cotton sj>eculatlon has taken a
holiday, prices scarcely varying, and the move
ment of both Is surprisingly small. Atlantic
exports of wheat. Hour included, have In four
weeks been only 8.27Â»,618 bushels, against 13.
574.'57 bushels last year, and Pacific exports
3.314,271, against 3,^8.505. The corn exports con
tinued about an larte as last year, but cotton
t-x|K>rts this month have been less than half of
last year's, "with some decrease on takings of
spinners Accumulated stocks In mills and mar
kets, both here and abroad, are so large that
there is no haste to pay tne prices tsked
The Industries are closing the most extraor
dinary year of their history. t<ons;-estabHshed
branches have undergone a veritable recon
struction, vastly increasing their capacity,
while new Industries, which scarcely existed a
year or two ago, have enlisted a vast capital,
altered the mode of business and production In
almost every direct! and improved condi
tions for the future almost beyond calculation.
Electrical developments In light, heat and
power. In making cataract work, performing
wonders In the production of materials and
providing transportation all over the land, de
serve especial attention. For such reconstruc
tion th.- Increase In demand for Iron and steel
products is th.- great feature of the year. With
41.-..733 tons unsold and 243,516 produced weekly.
January 1. hindered by severe weather so that
the output, March 1, dropped 15,000 tons, but
expanding in every month afterward, the In
dustry Is now producing about SOO.OOO tons
weekly and unsold stocks are reduced to 122,
523 tons, and yet orders unfilled will require
six to nine months' work from most of the es
tablishments. Prices have not changed the
past week, though the demand for products
Improved a little The average prices closed
119.*. per cent higher than January 1 for pig
and 102.8 per cent higher for products.
Industries which depend on Individual con
sumption have gained lea*, enough more than
population. Consumption of â â â¢.-. been
larger than ever, with an average advance of
29.5 per cent In prices of goods, though cotton
was for a time 32 per cent and Is 29 per cent
higher than January 1. Wool has been raised
1' speculation 35 per cent, but has been very
largely consumed, with great demand for goods,
which have advanced but 17 per cent. Stocks
now held are said to be 187,198,819 pounds.
Of hi '- and shoes the East has shipped 400 -
000 cases or 9 per cent more than !ast year and
274 per cent more than in IMS, but prices have
advanced only about 11 per cent since January
1. In ail these products trade shows i continu
ing strong demand, although quiet In the hol
iday week.
Failures for the week have been 221 in the
United States, against 252 last year, and 25 in
Canada, against 22 last year.

been a lay preacher for fifty years.

ALAMEDA COUNTY CITIES ARE
IMITATING SAN FRANCISCO
General Movement Across the Bay for Bonds for Public Improve-
* I "*â¢ HE fact that the city of San Francisco has so enthusiastically voted bonds for various public im-
JJ provements has stimulated the desire for bonds in all of the cities around the bay. The over
whelming success of the issue as raised in San Francisco has caused all of the cities of Ala
meda County to look to that method of raising money for municipal improvements, and each city has
some plan of its own for development.
Already the little town of Pleasanton has voted bonds for a municipal water supply, and they
have thus got ahead of the larger cities in the county.
Mayor R. W. Snow of Oakland has made the issuance of bonds for public improvements his great
administration measure. The matter in that city is now in the hands of the City Council, to which it has
been referred by the Mayor.
Alnmeda has a desire to improve its schools and build some new ones by the aid of bonds.
Berkeley wants a new High School nnd sees no way of getting the money unless by bonds.

DUNSMUIR-WALLACE
WEDDING ANNOUNCED
A MARRIAGE THAT WAS LONG
KEPT A SECRET.
The Bride Was the Mother of Edna
Wallace Hopper, the Charming
Actressâ Why the Matter
Was Kept Quiet.
OAKLAND, Doc. 29.â A secret mintage
of many pears' standing, with the princi
pals two of the best-known people on the
coast, has finally been announced to the
public, and Mrs. Josephine Wallace Is now
â aid to be the wife of Alexander Duns
muir, the coal king. The couple are now
In the East and have gone there on a be
lated honeymoon, leaving this announce
ment behind, tho secret at last to be riven
to the public.
The two are so well known that they
scarcely need to be Introduced. Alexan
der Dunsmuir Is the owner of vast coal
mines on Pugct Sound and the family Is
very weathly, perhaps the most wealthy
family of the great northwest Ills name
Is oynomymous with the coal Industry of
that section.
Mrs. Josephine Wallace Is the mother of
Edna Wallace Hopper, the charming
little actress. She was the wife of
Waller Wallace, the father of baseball op
this coast and connected with the old < ' lit
fornia Theater In .te days of Lawrence
Barrett and John kfcCuUough. She sep.
arated from Wallace and since then has
been caring for little Edna Wallace, who
has been married to and divorced from
De Wolf Hopper of "Wang 1 fame.
It was about a year ago when the
Souther Stock Farm, near San Leandro
was purchased, it was said by Bdna Wal-
I.m . Hopper for her mother. The Souther
Stock Kami was a very famous and his
torical place. In which lots of money had
been lost, and its sale created no little
talk, more particularly because of the
parties who purchased the place.
Hut It Is now said that tho purchase
was made by Mr. Dunsmuir not for Mrs.
Wallace, but for his wife, and thru they
have gone East leaving the announcement
to bo made while they are away. The ex
planation given or not having announced
it before is thai of business. It Is said
that had tho marriage been known he ,
would have forfeited a portion of his
father's estate and would not have In
herited the coal mines that he now owns. i

â¢ â 
The committees were composed of a
number of Aiameda - most refutable citi
zens. After ;t great deal "i work the
committees recommended that the sura of
$s<V>Â«.t would be necessary to carry out the
Ideas embodied In their reports, the fund
to be used as follows: The ian of J35.1W0
for the purpo.-e .ii Improving the public
.schools, J2s.wu for a library building arid
the sum of (20,000 for the improvement of
the Webster-street roadway.
The committee on the Webster-street
roadway stated that in order to Improve
that thoroughfare as It .should be done
would require the sum of I 5,000. This
Included the widening of the road so as
to elve it a width ol eight) feet. Owing
to the property fronting on the line of the
proposed Improvement being owned by
and eld in undivided interests and not of
sufficient value to stand the necessary
street assessment which might possibly
be levied for public work prevented tha
work being done other than by private
contract or by the city. As the former
idea .â ..1- deemed impossible by the com
mittee, they recommended that the ques
tion of the issuance of bonds to the ex
tent of $20,000 be submitted to the people
for their action, tin- money to be used for
temporarily Improving the roadway so as
to bring it in fairly good condition for
at least two years to come.
In the matter of Issuing bonds for the
purpose of erecting v new library build
ing, there is little doubt but what the peo
ple will vote as ,i unit for the bonds. The
Alameda Free Library has always been
an Institution of public pride and Alame
dans are justly proud of It and their
schools. In addition to the $23,000 asked
for by the committee there Is an addi
tional $10,000 donated by Andrew Carne
pie. With the Bum of 135,000 a building
could bo erected that would be ample to
the city's needs for a great many years
to come. It will not be necessary to pur
chase a lot for the building, as one was
purchased for this purpose tome years
! ago.
Some objections to the report on schools
is offered by members of the Board of
Education, Directors Brown and Keys be
ing opposed to the transferring of the
High School to the Porter School building,
and after making the necessary altera
tions and additions to the High School
building using it for grammar school pur
poses. Both Mr. Brown and Mr. Keys op
poso the Issuing of bonds, as th< say
they do not believe they are necessary.
In place of making numerous additions
and changes they favor the erection of a
new High School building, to be con
â¢ structed of brick or" stone. The other
members of the board and the league
committee are all of the opinion that the
number of scholars to each teacher Is too
largo and that more room is an absolute
necessity.
The league has a strong following and
there Is little doubt that a call for a bond
election will I*- made by the Trustees and
as there Is llttlo opposition offered the
bonds will no doubt carry.

struck his third finger of the I. ft har.Â«l

though exceedingly painful for the mo

by the popular Auditor and It worried him
very little that he was unable to extricate
the lead.
Later, however, the pain became so ex
cruciating and the Injured member be

MOVING TOWARD
A MUNICIPAL
WATER PLANT
Contract Let for Test
ing Roberts' Wells.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
SOS B road way. Dee. 23.
The contract for testing the Roberta
wells at San I^ormzo was finally awarded
by the Beard of Public Works this morn-
Ing to W. S. Piers of Centcrvllle. The con
tract price Is $2M7. and the work will be
commenced at once.
The matter of testing the weils haÂ»
hung fire In the Board of Works for >oma
time, owing to the failure of City Engi
neer Clement, who was 111. to prepare the
necessary specifications, and its settle*
ment this morning was a relief to the city
ofllclals. A most thorough test by the
air pressure method will be- made of all
the wells, and the work will be done un
der the personal supervision of the City
Engineer. The cost of the work was much
lower than was expected.
Those Interested In the progress of the
municipality see In the awarding of the
contract this morning the first step to
ward the establishment of a water plant
to be owned and controlled by the city.
A provision has bÂ«Â»en made that any dam
age done to the wells by thÂ« city's test
will be borne by th*Â» owner.

WANTED TO GO BY THE
REGULAR MONOXIDE ROUTE
Weignnd Roth Made Careful Prepar
ation to Accomplish Self-
Destruction.
OAKLAND. Doc. 23.â Welgand Roth,
who Js supposed to be a cooper employed
with the Wunder Browing Company of
Sari Francisco, came to Oakland early
this evening determined to commit suicide
by the gas route. Ho came well prepared,
for he had In his possession a long 1 thin
rubber tube through which he hoped the
messenger of death would waft him Into
eternity. Roth engaged a room at the
Hotel Shasta. H. appeared pale and
nervous and complained he was not feel-
Ing well. He wished an ordinary' small
outside room and was accommodated. He
thÂ«n sat down and wrote two letters,
which he stamped and addressed to '.'P.
Koonig, lir.9 Mission street. San Fran
cisco." and "Richard Cumpelander. cor
ner California and Kearny Btreets, San
Francisco." and then proceeded to Inhale
monoxide. He attached the tubÂ« to the
unUpped pas Jet. tying It with a string
so as to make It secure, then turning on
the gas. laid "the line of hose" to the
bed. and after arranging the pillows com
fortably lay down, placed the end of Uie
tube in his mouth and closed his eyes to
the world.
Several hours later the landlady, noting
thÂ» strong odor of pas. traced It to Roth's
room, broke open the door and found him
unconscious on the bed. Ho was promptly
removed to the Receiving Hospital, where
he lies to-night between life and death
on a cot. Dr. Rowe has little hope that
Roth will survive. He li apparently a
German, aged about 40 yea/8, and in one
of his pockets was found a paper show
ing that he was naturalized In San Fran
cisco In April. IKS 2.
LOTTERIES ARE NOW
BEING SUPPRESSED
OAKLAND. Dec. 29.â For the first time-
In the history of the city the Chinese lot
teries are now at a standstill, and the po
lice believe that they may succeed in driv
ing the Chinese gamblers out of town. For
years this has been one of the hardest
problems for the local police to solve. Ar
rest aJter arrest has been made, but con
victlons by Juries wt-re difficult to obtain,
and when ono was convicted and given a
stiff sentence It did not deter htm from
Immediately reopening the game.
At la&t Chief of Police Hodgklns decided
upon heroic measures as the only way to
rid the city of the nuisance. He placed a
patrolman at the entrance of each of the.
principal "Joints," and assisted by fre
quent raids he has succeeded in frighten
ing the patrons away. In discussing th*Â»
situation to-day Chief Hodgklns said:
"My plan of placing patrolmen at the
doors of tbo various lottery Joints has so
far been successful, and I am thoroughly
satisfied with the experiment. On account
of the difficulty In pocurlng convictions
and the persistence of the Chinese In con
tinuing their plnying I can see no other
way to effectually break up tho business.
I would advise other cities to try the ex
periment, and I am sure the results would
\>e satisfactory."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY. DECEMBER 30, 1899.
HIGGINS WILL
BE DAN BURNS'
NEW MANAGER
Railroad Makes the
Choice.
LINDLEY'S REIGN IS OVER
HE FOLLOWS McLAUGHLIN IN
DISFAVOR,
The Mexican Will Have the Benefit
of the Experience of Mark ham's
Private Secretary in His
Senatorial Campaign.
Dan Burns does not believe In the adage
that it 1b dangerous to change horses In
the middle of a stream, or perhaps he
suspects what others know of his chances
of success and doesn't care. He has tal&n
the direction of his Senatorial fortunes
out of the hands of Hervey Lindley and
placed them in the care of M. R. Illggins.
This Is not the nr?t time that Burns and
his Southern Pacific supporters have
found fault with his managers. The pub
lic has probably not forgotten the time
when Burns deposed Major Frank Mc-
Laughlin from his high estate as man
ager of thÂ© Mexican Senatorial forces.
The major was exceedingly angry when
The Call published the fact of his down
fall. He spluttered and reared, but the
fact remained that he had boen shorn of
his authority by the fickle and exacting
Dan. That was in the very midst of the
last session of the Legislature and Mc
laughlin naturally felt chagrined to see
Hervey Llndley take his place. But he
may have some consolation in the fact
that Lindley, too, has fallen from grace
and has been supplanted by a new fa
vorite.
It Is notorious, of course, that Lindley
did nothing for Burns during the Legisla
tive session and nobody is advised that he
did anything since. The approach of an
extra session made it imperative for
Burns and his Southern Pacilic Railroad
supporters to secure a new Senatorial
manager for the Mexican. After canvass
ing the field very thoroughly the railroad
selected M. R. Hicgins. For the peculiar
service for which he has beÂ» selected
Hlpgins possesses better qualifications
than his predecessors.
His political methods and knowledge are
known to Bui and have that worthy's
entire approval. This fact 13 enough prob
ably to characterize them. Hlgglns first
became generally known as the private
secretary of ex-Governor Markham. In
that capacity he learned all of the tricka
which Burns hopes to make valuable In
his campaign. Alter his retirement as
private sec rotary to Governor Markham
Hlggins entered a new school of experi
ence rb Insurance Commissioner. As he
is considered both by the railroad people
i and by Burns as a good manager he will
probably have the laugh on McLaughlin
and Llnd'ey until the counting of Burns'
votes begins.
AN EXPOSE DESTROYS
THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN
Fails to Discuss Extra Session
With Legislators.
Only Nine Members Honor His Invitation
to a Conferenceâ Storms Named
as a Mining Expert.
Special Plppatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Dec 2?.-The scheme of
the Governor to Induce members of the
Legislature to meet him ostensibly to con
â lder expenditure* In reference to the
mother lode of the State, but really to
discuss an extra *>-sslon, has failed. The
exp Â»c of the scheme In The Call to-day
created a sensation, and the contemplated
discussion of the conference was aban
doned. GaLe had sent out a preat many
Invitations, but only nine members of the
Legislature respnnded. The expose had
h:>il the effect of keeping many of the In
vited ones away and it would have been
i.ilo to discuss the question before nine
men.
Those who attended the conference which
was hold in the Governor's office wore as
follows: Lieutenant Governor NefT. Sen-
M a guard and Assemblymen Raub,
Boecher. Lardncr, Dunlnr. Robinson, Jil
son and Blood. The conference was brief
and to Â«the point, only the mother lode
proposition iK-inp discussed. At the re
quest of the nine legislators assembled the
rernoi nted Expert W. H. Btorms
anine the ledges of the lode. At the
close of the c 1 Gage Issued the re
quired commission.
A great deal of controversy has already
taken place over this matter. It will be
remembered that the Legislature adopted
a measure providing for the appointment
nf two experts and the necessary funds
to make the examinations. There was a
defect in the hill which made it uncon
stitutional, but Gage appointed the two
experts and failed to secure their ratifica
tion from State Mineralogist <'ooper.
This officer positively declined to give his
t and It remains to be seen
not he will now give his In
dorsement to Storms.
It lÂ« .1 significant fact that the members
of the Legislature who attended th<
rnor*s private office
expected that i <Â«1 be
sprung. One legislator remarked:
'The Governor must have had some
thing more in view than the appointment
of an expert. A simple letter to each
member would have brought out all the
information wanted in that respect. We
all expected that something would be
brought up relating to the proposed extra
â â . and I think something WOUld
have been said if The Call had not sprun?
the letter inviting the mother lode mem
bers to come tv Sacramento."
It transpires that Jilsonâ the Jllson of
fragrant memoryâ had a candidate for ex
pert. Mr. Anderson of the State Univer
sity was Jilson's choice at the beginning,
but the name n-ae withdrawn after As
semblymen Blood, Lardner and Dunlap
eulogized Mr. Storms. Beioro the meet
ing broke up Storms was elected by ac
clamation. The lmpreÂ«Â«lon was given to
the members' present that Storms was ac
ceptable to the Mining Bureau.
Trustee W. I^. Watts, who was recently
appointed expert, attended the session.
The a.Â«Â«Â»>rti'm made Officially by Mayor
Phrlan th:c â  â¢â¢â  would mil an
extra session to meet January S provoked
a storm of Indignation In the executive of
tico. Th<- Governor sai<l to thÂ»- agent of
the Apsociat^il l'n'ss that he did not be
lieve thai Mayoi Phelan made the state
ment. The Qovernor added: "1 do not be
!lÂ«vi- that Mayor Phelan wouH state that
which is wilfully false." The Govi
talked freely.
In tho course of an extended Interview
the executive said:
"I have received petitions representing
J2Tio.ooo,oofi worth of property urging me to
call an extra session of the Legislature to
legislate regarding San Francisco's water
front. Within a day or two I haw re
ceived additional petitions, one of which
If represented to be from the wholesale
butchers of Sun Francisco, and among th<>
."iKiiatures are such ad that of Miller ft
"I have been importuned to call an
extra session by the greatest political
leaders of both the State and the na
tion. The pressure brought to bear
upon me has been tremendous.
"Notwithstanding this. I have not made
up my mind to call an extra session, and
all reports to the contrary are absolutely
false. â¢. :â 
"In this regard my mind Is lust the
s=amt> as it was aft<-r thf adjournment of
the Legislature. I do not want you to
tlilr.k that 1 Ipnoro these petitions, and I
do not want the men who signed them to
think that I will ignore them. I want you
to Fay that I have neither decided to call
or not to call an extra session, and I do
not want it to appear that I have ignored
thejte petitions. I have reached no deter
mtnation In the matter whatever, regard
ks? of any reports, no matter from where
they may emanate."
The statement was volunteered that the
call for the extra session would be written
by the Governor in person at his otllce
here In the Capitol, and no person what
erer would know anything whatsoever
about It until It Is Issued and made pub
lic. The broad assertion was qualified
with thlÃ supplementary proviso: "This Is.
of course if I should call an extra ses
sion, which, I repeat, I have not yet de
termined to do."
Tb" Oovemor can dismiss from his mind i
the fancy that Mayor Phelan was mis
quoted. The Mayor announced without '
hesitation or qualification that the Gov- !
ernor would call an extra session of the j
Legislature. The intelligence from Sacra
mento that Gage has determined to write
the proclamation himself will be received
by Herrin and Dibble with leelings of
keen regret. It was supposed that Dibble
had air. -l.ly drawn the call, leaving blank 1
spaces for the subjects of legislation and
the day of meeting. Perhaps the instal
lation of If. R. Hlggins as D. M. Burns'
new manager has sidetracked Judge Dib
ble.
COOPER IS OBDURATE.
OAKI^AND. Dec. 29.â State Mineralo
gist A. S. Cooper Fays: "Mr. Storms was
formerly employ" .1 by the State Mining
Bureau, but of late has been with the
Mining and Scientific Press. His appoint
ment will be treated just as the others
were v far as I an concerned. That

SCOTT A CANDIDATE.
Union Iron Works' Manager
in the Fight for Senator.
Irving M. Scott, vice president and gen
eral manager of the Union Iron Works,
is a candidate for the oltiee of United
State? Senator from California. The an
nouncement, which was made yesterday,
was undoubtedly hastened by the belief
that the report is well founded that the
Governor Intends to issue within a few
the call for an extra stsslon of the
U ure.
"I wai asked several days ago." said
Mr. Scott yesterday to a reporter for The
Call, "if in the event of the calling of an
extra session my name would be present
ed as a candidate for United States Sena

asked. An you in favor of a caucus?" I
said "I am.'
"In line with those answers I repeat
that I will be a candidate at the extra ses
