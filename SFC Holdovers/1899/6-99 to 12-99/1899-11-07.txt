VOLUME LXXXVr-NO. 160.
SPLENDID VICTORY 15 ASSURED TOR HORACE DAVIS
Mighty Ovation to His Candidacy
at the Closing Meeting in
Metropolitan Temple.
REPUBLICANS signalized the close
of the campaign by a magnificent
demonstration last night at Met
ropolitan Temple. Within the
four vra!ls of that groat structure
many orators have charmed their hearers
In days gone by ar.d many audiences have
applauded the sentiments enunciated from
Its platform, but never within the mem
ory of man has there been held there,
even during this enthusiastic campaign,
such a splendid audience; never have the
walls reverberated with such soul->-tirring
speech, and never have the rafters rolled
Lack such groat waves of applause.
It was a treat to â â Ââ  one of the thou
fsnus That had the good fortune to gain
admittance. All classes were there ap
parently, judging from the responses to
the appears of the speakers, andâ good
omen for Republican success and un
doubted proof of prosperity under the
present Republican administrationâ all
classes were â¢ill dressed and cheerful
looking.
There was a feeling of satisfaction in
the air, manifested time and time again
before the mooting began in cheers and
loud handclapping, for no other cause
apparently save than that thoss present
felt good over something and wanted to
let their fellows know it.
A large number of ladles lent color and
beauty to the mass and gave proof that
the issues in this campaign have been
disc-;- â  in the homes of the city and
have found approval there. The seating
capacity of floor and galleries was ail
taken up before the band came in from
the street to gain applause and Increase
the general cheerful feeling with the air
"Because 1 Love You," which the audi
ence evidently thought applied to the Re
publican leader for they cheered more and
more lustily.
In addition to the general cheerful feel
ing there was maniteat on the faces of
voters a look of confidence, which was in
creased when the candidates speakers
und others riled on the platform and
look their seals. They were a fine-look-;
Ing lot and there is .small wonder they
have inspired contidence in the voters.
2t was noticeable, too, that the profes
sional politician was absent and that in
Ills place were Republicans to whom the
entire city always takes off its hat. Ex-
Chief of Police Patrick Crowley was one
of these. Judge Charles W. Slack was
another and Judge Van H. Paterson an
other. They are not stump speakers.
They did not go to the meeting to rant
and throw their hands in the air. They
went to approve by their presence the
candidacy of Horace Davis and his fel
lows on the Republican ticket.
In the chairman of the meeting, Frank
3S^ii, was another tigure unfamiliar to
the audiences who know a politician as
far as they can see him. lie was there
us a representative of the working classes
t,{ San Francisco to add his meed of
tribute to the goodness of heart ana ster
ling worth of Horace Davis, who, he con
lldently predicted, would be elected to-day.
Another worKingman. James K. Murphy,
who had once been in the employ of Mr.
l>avis. was also there Vj add his heart
lilt testimuny to that of many that his
"old boss" was always. the friend of the
laboring man.
Small wonder, then, with such an audi
ence, such speakers and such an occasion,
the close of the Republican campaign in
Fan Francisco was a brilliant one; small
â wonder that the orators were at their,
best; that the applause was so spontan
eous and that the one cry as the meeting
dispersed was. "Victory." All of them.
speakers, candidates and auditors, will be
out bright and early'this morning working
for the success of the ticket. With the
shoutings of the captains still ringing in
their ears the issue can never be doubtful.
First add Metropolitan meetingâ Alfred
Alfred Bouvier, chairman of the Repub
lican campaign committee, opened the
meeting. He said: "Ladies and gentle
men, it is indeed a pleasure as well as an
honor to have the .privilege of opening so
magnificent a meeting as this. There has
never been a campaign in the city of San
Francisco where the interests of the
Workingmen have been so much at stake
us in the present one. It is therefore
more fitting that the gentleman selected
to preside over this meeting be selected
from that great body of Industrial work
ers, whom, to quote the words of Mr. Hor
nce Davis, spoken by him in the. ills of
Congress, 'form the very cornerstone of a
free republic' The gentleman selected to
jireside over you this evening is a crafts
man who has carved his own position
v.ith his own hands by his own hard
â¢work. Ladies and gentlemen, I introduce
t<> you Mr. Frank Ryan."
Cheer on cheer followed the introduction
of Mr. Ryan, and more followed as the
figure of "Horace Davis came into view.
The vast audience fairly went wild. Men
nnd women on the floor, in the galleries
end on the platform rose, wildly shaking
),ats and handkerchiefs and yelling them
eelvee hoarse in acclaim to the next
Mayor of San Francisco. Mr. Davis' face
broke Into smiles at this flattering recep
tion and he bowed right and left as he
took his seat next to that of the chair
man.
It was many second? before tnÂ« ap
plause that greeted the appearance of the
lioftd of the Republican .ticket subsided
nnd Mr. Ryan's voice could be heard In
the opening remarks.
Mr. Ryan was a new speakerâ as he said
himself, he had never addressed a politi
cal meeting before, but he had not uttered
a dozen words until he had made a dis
tinct hit with all his hearers. Straight
from the heart came his words, ringing 1
with honest manliness, â¢ -â¢ â¢â â ing to the*
truth of the tribute he raid at the feet
of the Republican candidate for Mayor.
"I am pleased to have been selected," he
paid. "as a representative of the working
classes to preside over this meeting. I
&m a workinsman, and this is the first po
litical meeting I over Kpoko at in my
life."
"You're all risrht." rang nut a voice from
thÂ« pnllerv. '.'You're all right," was
echoed and re-echoed by the big throng.
nnd Mr. Ryan's maiden speech was again
Intorrupted by resounding applause.
"I hav< been thirty-flve years in San
Frnnci?â¢," continued Mr. Ryan, "and I
never was a politician; r.rver took an In
terest or lORt an hour's rest 5n any polit
ical campaign; hut. somehow or other,
this campaign stirred me up."
"Rah! rah! raX" phouted the audience.
"G<l it. you're a!) right."
"I came here- to-night." wp-nt on Ryan,
"on the one condition that I* was not to
make a speech. 1 simply came to wpress
my fee-lings toward the Hon. Horace
Davis, our next Mayor." â 
Applause in pre;i; waves broke over the
orator at this mention of the name of the
Republican candidate, and It was a full
minute before Mr. Ryan could nroceod
"I came hero." he repeated, "to express
my feelings toward tho Hon. Horace
Davis, and I hopo and feel â¢ that every
workinpman takes the same Interest" in
him to-day as I do."
Again the walls shook with shouts and
th" nir was thick with waving: hands and
hats, and again Mr. Ryan was compelled
to stop in the middle of hi a address. When
he was again allowed to proceed he told
n story, often punctuated by hearty hand
clapping, showing the kindness of heart
of the Republican candidate for Mayor
and hit? constant readiness to extend a
helping hand to the work!nn-mr-n In and
out of a .lob. Hfl pave as an Illustration
of this well-known trait of Mr. Davis the
Etorv of his own experience.
"That," he concluded, "Is why I came
here to express my feelings on br-half of
Horace Davis, whom I know is going to
be the next Mayor of Bon Francisco.
i
The San Francisco Call
There is no doubt about it. I have been i
a!l around town to-day, ar.d I have found
lots of people who voted tor Pheian last
: â  â â : who are not going to vote for Pheiau
ihis year."
Three cheers for Horace Davis and !
throe more for* Ryan greeted this happy
I conclusion, marking the. maiden speech of I
! the representative of the working classes j
ol San Francisco. No more tolling politi- !
: cal address liu.s been made before any i
audienco . i ring the campaign.
Crlts of "Van Duzer! van Duzer!" were i
: hoard, and In response Judge A. P. Van i
Duzer came forward, He said that it I
was not the thunder that splits the oak j
i and crushes tne rock, but that it was the '
; lightning. "Then, 1 say," said Mr. Van !
i Duzer, "it Id .. >â â  thÂ« orator that will j
] bring about a Republican victory. Ail '
; the orators this side of kingdom come '
i cannot accomplish as much good as sin- !
cere work on election day by the friends â 
; of Horace Davis.
j "To-day the manager of Honorable â 
: James G. Maguire told mo that last year ;
; i'helan iraue'i .off the 'Little Giant' of
: Democracy that Phelan's ambition might i
;be gratified. At the city election this
man said, 'We propose to pay up our j
s-curc with Mr. Pheian with compound in- I
tereat. 1
"When Pheian says that Mr. Davis will
not carry out the provisions of the char- '
ier he utters an infamous slander and he i
knows it to be such. This demagogy is
unworthy of any man who aspires to be ;
Mayor of this big city."
Great applause greeted the speaker as
he retired. District Attorney Murphy fol !
lowed. lie Insisted that national politics
was involved in the city election, for the '
reason that the country is on the eve of a !
Presidential election and that it is the â 
duty of every section thai has benefited i
by the Republican administration to up- 'â 
hold the hand of McKinley. !
"As California goes so may. go the
Union,.: said the speaker. "This State i
rightfully belongs In the Republican col- '
umn. (Applause). Mr. Davis is tne arnii- :
tect of his own fortune. tie was not born
with a golden spoon in his mouth. That !
Mr. Pheian was Is not against him; it Is '
merely his good luck. "With all the ridi- I
cule and vituperation that has been
heaped apon Mr. Davis by a subsidized
pre.sÂ» none has had the hardihood to |
question his honesty and Integrity He
is president of the Lick School, an Insti- j
tution that has done more for the youth
Of Mils city than any other in San Fran- '
Cisco. What more do the people of this
city want than such a candidate as Hor- !
ace Davis? He is pure. His home life- is :
pure. (Applause.) He Is Pheian's peer i
from a moral standpoint as well as Intel
lectually. . (Great cheering.; if you want
good government vote the Republican
ticket from head to foot."
Judge Murphy in closing made an ap- ;
peal to the voters to cast their ballots for
Alfred Black for District Attorney. He :
said that during the twelve years he had
occupied a seat on the Superior bench i
Mr. Byin^ton, the Democratic candidate
had never appeared in his courtroom to
try a case.
"Let me tell you, fellow-citizens, that
the District Attorney's office is not a'
kindergarten to teach inexperienced law
yers crimi'.a! law," said Judge Murphy.
I. Golden, a young orator, asserted that
the charter was not an issue in the cam
paign. "The candidates might as well say
that they -would support the constitution
of the United States as to uphold tne pro
visions of the charter. Both are the laws
of the land, and a man would be a traitor
to his country who would not obey their
provisions," said Golden.
The Knickerbocker quartet made a hit
with a parody on a popular air, the re
frain of winch was "Gnod-by," Jimmy
good-by; your tricks are vain, your ways
are dark." "
Judge A. B. Hunt, Registrar of the
United States Land Office, made a brief
speech replete with humor. He said that
if the audience was an indication of *"he
sentiment of the city Horace Davis would
be the next Mayor of San Francisco
Judge Van R. Paterson, the next sneak
er, said that if Republicans are loyal to
their duty to-day there can be but one
resultâ victoryâ for the entire Republican
ticket, from top to -bottom; and not only
that, but It will be a vote of confidence â 
in and a vote of cheer to honorf-d end ;
beloved President "William McKinley No
Republican, he continued, knowing the
record of the Republican party, and view- :
ing the splendid achievements' of the pies- :
ent Republican administration, could vote !
for the nominee of the Democratic party :
in preference to the nominee of his own
party, especially when that nominee **as :
such a genuine man, physically, mentally i
morally, as Horace Davis. He closed by 1
stating thai there was no doubt of the !
ability of Mr. Davis to till the office, and !
he promised for the Republican candl- j
date, if elected, a perfect administration
of municipal and school departments
Judge Paterson dwelt on the record of ,
Mr. Davis In the halls of Congress, and
from it added to the testimony already I
off*.- red of the well-known fact that Mr.
Davis was the sterling friend of labor.
Judge Faterson called attention to. the
remarkable change of attitude on the part
of James D. Phelan since the last visit
of William J. Bryan. Then, he said, Mr.
Phflan was willing thai the people should 1
hear of national issues. Now it is differ- 1

SAN FRANCISCO, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 7, 1899.
CLOSING OUTBURST OF ENTHUSIASM FOR HORACE DAVIS.
HORACE DAVIS INDORSED
BY THE STURDY LABORER
* ""^ DTTOR of The Call: As a -worklneman who apprecla'ep fully the favors that have been extended t" the craft, T am
H forced, in justice to myself and my fellow laborers, to draw a comparison between Hon. Horace Davis and Mayor
James D. Phelan. Which of the two has proven himself the friend of the laboring man? One P. H. McCarthy,
pay or promise of patronage, has appended hiÂ«< name to a statement in which It la claimed that. Mayor
Phelan if. practically the only friend the wage earner has ever had In an official position. It is a fact that Mr.
Phelan has passed off on the unsuspecting worklnjrmen several beautifully pllded bricks. It Is a fact, on the
oth^r hand, that when the workinemen needed a friend In the halls of Congress Horace Davis was there. When the
Chinese exclusion act was In the balance, he did not wait to consult his own interests, but appreciating the dangers that
were threatened if the immigration of coolie labor was not checked, he stood by the worklngman, and at the expense of
losing a lucrative trade with Cnina. cast his vote on our side of thp question. The effect that this mipht have on his
income did not influence the Republican candidate for Mayor. He thought only of the American workingmen who de
pended upon their daily labor for their bread, and he made his fight in favor of the exclusion act solely because he
thought it would benefit them.
Here is a man who stood by labor when It needed a friend. Here Is a man who has always stood by the wag;>
earner. It is our duty in this campaign to show our appreciation for what he has dune for us by casting our vote for
him for Mayor of San Francisco. There Is not Â» laboring man In this city who has a grain of gratitude In his make
up -who can conscientiously do anything else. Horace Davis has made sacrifices for us and we should consider it a priv
be given this opportunity of showing In a small way our appreciation The manner in which Horace Davis has
his own employes gives the b<st idea of the man. The manner In which his employes speak of him and think of
him and feel toward him is one of his strongest recommendations to the voters of San Francisco. The man who has
earned the love and respect of his employes can safely be trusted to administer the duties of the Mayor's office.
This Is one picture; now look upon the other. Mr. Pheian's friends claim that he is the laboring man's friend be
cause he appointed fifteen workingmen on the charter committee of one hundredâ a bare representation to the class of
citizens who compose nearly 90 per cent of the city's population. That appointment was a gold brick. It was done to
throw sand in the eyes of the workingmen. but the little Mayor has underestimated their intelligence. The working
men are not so easily fooled.
On the Board of Freeholders he gave us three out of fifteen. Another gilded package. It was not a fair repre
sentation, and the Mayor knew it.
None of the provisions in the charter for which McCarthy elaJms credit for thp Mayor were Inserted upon Mr.
Pheian's suggestion or through his Influence. The eight-hour day, the rate of compensation to the city laborer and the
Initiative and referendum were put into the charter in deference to a demand made in writing by the labor unions of San
Francisco.
From the manner In -which Mr. Phelan refers to these matters we are led to believe that he looks upon the work
ingmen as suppliants for charity. lie would lead tis to believe that the eight-hour day and the $2 pay provided in tho
â  for that amount of labor was an act of pure benevolence on hi? part. The workingmen do not take kindly to
any such imputation. All that they have ever asked is just treatment and fair recognition. They have received both
at the hands of lion. Horace LMvis. They have been extended neither by Mayor Phelan. It le their duty to stand Dy
their friend. It is their duty to vote for Hon. Horace Davis fur Mayor of San Francisco.
E. L. MALSBARY.
ent. Why? Because Mr. Phelan was
afraid of national issues.
'â¢The reason," continued Judpe Paterson.
"that Republicans are talking about na
tional Issues in this campaign is that
which led Bryan t>i say at Denver, 'San
Francisco will go Democratic at the next
Htv election, and thai will be the b.^st
indication that California will go Demo
cratic at the next Presidential election.'
It is to present national Issues because
they are a part of the case.
"I say there is a question whether Re
publicans shall be loyal to their princi
ples, loyal to their party, loyal to their
President That "is tne question for you
to answer. Seventy millions of people
will look to you to-morrow to know
whether you. who are nearest the Philip
pines, should look out the Golden Gate
upon the Orient and indorse the policy of
William McKinley, or whether you deny
the rii^'ht of the President to do as he has
done."
James E. Murphy, a workingman, who
appeared at ohe of the meetings last week I
I to testify to. the good deeds of Horace I
Republican Success Will Mean
Continued Commercial and
Industrial Prosperity to City.
Davis, was the next speaker. He had
worked, he said, for eight years for ihe
Republican candidate for Mayor, and he
had come again to testify to the great
ness of heart of "his old boss." His tes
timony was couched in jerky periods, but
It brought out round after round of ap
plause.
Another selection by the Knickerbocker
Quartet, and F. H. Wheeler was in
troduced. He remarked that there were
a good many kinds of Democrats -
gold Democrats, silver Democrats, ex
pansion Democrats, anti-expansion Dgm
ocrais, and the Phelan appointees,
lan that there was only one kind of a
Republican and he stood .solid for 11
Davis for Mayor of San Francisco. H>'
said Phelan's idea of the campaign was,
"M< or not me."
At the close of Mr. Wheeler's address
there were cries for Horace Davis, ai
though the Republican candidate was not
â¢ xpected to speak, the audience insisted
upon hearing him. Cheer after
greeted him. For fully fifteeen minutes
the temple fairly shook with the applause
that greeted Hon. Horace Davis. When he
stepped to the front of the platform the
audience stood up And shouted. Men
threw their hats in the air and the women
waved their handkerchiefs. No candidate
for public office In this city ever received
such an ovation, and Mr. Davis was vis
ibly affected by the feeling that was man
ifested toward him. When his voice could
be heard above the din he said:
"I can tell you that I fee! much encour
aged at the outlookâ" The speaker had
to stop. The applause broke dut afresh
at the announcement and the audience re
fused to subdue Its enthusiasm for some
minutes. Continuing, Mr. Davis stated
that wherever he had been his reception
had been gratifying.
"I am perfectly satisfied," said Mr.
Davis, "that we will tarry the day to
morrow. It Is only a question of ma
jority. I am not an oversanguine man,
but that is my honest opinion to-niKht.
1 ask you to vote the Republican ticket
straight, without a scratch. It is the best
ticket ever presented for the suffrages
of the voters of this city. It was se
lected with the greatest care, and if
elected it is going to give you good gov
ernment; It is pledged to do it by the
traditions of our party. It has always
been In the front ranks of progress, re
form ami advancement. The Republican
States are those where the public schools
are the thickest and most advanced.
"I do not <are about the vilification
that has been directed against me. (Pro
longed applause.) Democratic pa
cannot hurt mo; they cannot stop me
from talking to you. They have done me
good. Scores of Democrats have told me
that they are going to vote the Repub
lican ticket tor no other reason than the
vile abuse that the Democratic papers
have aimed at us. In closing, let me as
sure you that I expect to be elected
Mayor of San Francisco at to-morro\v's
â  n."
E. Myron Wolf and Frank J. Symmes
spoke briefly and Hon. F. X. Schoon
maker was introduced. He was given a
hearty reception. He said that he had
been advised by his friends to wave the
American flag when h* spoke.
"Let me tell you that we have waved
the American flag at every meeting we
nave held during this campaign. But
bear In mind that our opponent has not
even once referred to the stars and
stripes."
Mr. Schoonmaker spoke on the import
ant bearing the city election would have
on the national campaign. For fully an
hour he held the attention of the audi
ence. It was nearly midnight when the
meeting closed with three' rousing cheers
for Davis and the Republican ticket.

RUMORS OF THE SACK
ON THE WATER FRONT
Rumors were rife yesterday that the
Phelan sack was wide open on the city
frunt. Ever since the campaign opened
the Democratic shouters have been trying
to deceive themselves into believing that
I'ht-lan had a lead pipe cinch along the
wharves and could win bands down. As

The situation demanded prompt action,
and a hasty consultation at th>- la^t hour
resulted in the selection of a party motto
for the Democracy without a platformâ
"Gold bricks are cheap, but it takes mon

too." Five dollars pi-r \ole is none too
high, and to-night In the vicinity of Fol

But the question is: In these, the days

ARCH-ENEMY OF FREE EDUCATION
IS PHELAN'S STRONG BACKER
â 
H6 Â£S ILUHIAN A. S. HALLIDIE, the arch enemy of free education
6 and the foe of civilization, came out last evening in Phelan's
? organettc, protesting against foisting national or party politics into
S5 â  .:. Ipal elections.
The last protest Hallidie uttered before the one recorded yes
Â« terday was against free education at the State University. He
wanted to impose or. the students a tuition fee. He worked with
â  desperai I levy the tax. The Regents had to rally to prevent
m wrecking the university. This is the type of man that
2 opposes Hoi-ace Davis.
At the session of the Regents July 1, 1898, Hallidie openly
â  advocated the tax. Why did he propose to overthrow the law pro
a viding that educition should be free to allP The Call tells the
Â£ people of San Francisco that Hnllidie's management of the flnan-
B lal rltairs of the university caused a deficit, and to bridge over the
â  financial embarrassment he proposed to levy a tax on every stu
f| dent applying for admission to the university. Hallidie would tax
Â£ pupils'entering the public schools as readily as he would tax them
O for entering the university.
? He declared in the Board of Regents that education was a
9 privileg-3, not a right. His declaration astounded the friends of free
g education. Regents seeing the peril of the university were brought
from 'the interior and Southern California to defeat Hallidie's de-
El
n sig-n.
The voice of Stephen M. White was raised to save the univer
ii sity. The students and the friends of free education routed Silurian
Hallidie, and he was not heard from again until he came out for
5 Phelan last evening.
? Let voters of San Francisco who have sons and daughters to
3 educate remember that A. S. Hallidie opposes Horace Davis.
Hallidie favors Phelan and a tax on education.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 7, 1899.
WITH X AT THE SIGHT
OF EACH NAME VOTED
UNITED STATES
HOLDS TUTUILA
Agreement Reached in
Samoan Question.
Dlspat h to The Call.
LONDON, Nov. 6.â Although the exact
i terms of the agreement are still carefully
i guarded, the Associated Press is able to
[ say that the Samoan question is practical
ly settled, and that the finalities will take
' place wltntn a few days, unless some most
I unexpected hitch occurs.
But it can be said that American control
'of Tutuila is confirmed- and agreed to,
while the United States has, it is under
stood, signified Its approval of the pro
jected arrangements between Germany
axid. Great Britain. Regarding tho details
of the latter, the British Foreign Office
I remains mute, except to authorize the
I statement that none of the recent sur
j raises of the Gorman press have correctly
| outlined the plan which now seems sure
!of acceptance. It Is also emphatically de
! nied that the United States has been In
: any way neglected in the negotiations.
I It is pointed out that the United States,
1 having secured Tutuila Island, obtained.
i all she expected or desired, but. though
i thoroughly satisfied, she was kept con
i versant with the situation as the negotia
tions proceeded between Great Britain
; and Germany. Last week It was believed
! that an impasse had been reached, and
j the diplomats wore inclined to fear that
j settlement was obtainable In the near
i future. The sudden turn In the negotia
i tions and the overcoming, of the appar
ently insurmountable obstacles created
almost as much surprise as gratification.
Of course it Is still within the limits of
possibility that another and entirely un
expected contingency may arise during
the interim of the drawing up of the
papers and signing them. But there is
every reason to believe that an official
statement will be given out this week an
: nouncing the terms of settlement of this
lone-standing International difficulty.

Condition.
PATERSON, X. J.. Nov. 6.-The condi

changed. He spent a fairly comfortable
day and slept a good part of the time.
Dr. Newton was asked what he thought
of the chances of Mr. Hobart to survive
during the week, and paid that it was im
possible to make even an intelligent guess
as his patient was liable to die at almost
any minute and might survive for several
weeks, although his recovery was impos
| sible.
He spent a comfortable day and sat up
in bed, propped up by pillows for a long
time. The news of the day was read to
him. but he was not. allowed to enter into
discussion upon it. He made comments
but when he started to speak at- length
upon any subject his attention was at
once turned to something else. He was in
excellent spirits. He saw no one during
the day and sent his regrets to callers

Kentucky Militia to Be Called
Out to Protect Voters From
Intimidation,
LOUISVILLE, Ky., Nov. 6.â Governor
Bradley, In his capacity as com
mander In chief of the State Na
tional Guard, is the central figure
In the political situation to-night.
The Governor believes the situation to be
60 serious that he would not go to his
home at Lancaster, only about 100 miles
from Louisville, to cast his vote to-mor
row. A report was current to-night that
all of the companies of the Ixiulsville Le
gion, the local militia organization, had
been ordered to report for duty at 6
o'clock to-morrow morning. The report
could not be confirmed, and there was no
unusual activity among members of the
regiment, but the rumor is given signifi
cance from the fact that Governor Brad
ley positively refused to confirm or deny
it or to say what his plans were beyond
an expression contained In a letter which
he made public to-night. The Governor
â¢was expected to address a meeting at the
Auditorium to-night, but changed his
mind, giving out the following In expla
nation for his refusal to attend:
Hon. A. B. Watsonâ My Dear Sir: In view
of the Intense public excitement now preva.il-
Ihg â â , this cat., and the fact that nunvorous
atridavits of good citizens have been tiled with
me bhowing- that theie is grave danger of riot
and -.-,-. ... that citizens will be pre
vented by force and fraud from exercising their
right of FUft'rate In this city to-morrow, and
In view of the further tact that 1 have been
called upon to act as chief peace officer of the
commonwealth, I have concluded that It wou:d
be Improper lor me to deliver an address Ibis
event ns.
I will thank you to assure those who may
kindly honor me by their presence that I will
remain In the city and see that every voter,
irrespective of political opinion, is protected in
his right to vote and have his vote counted
and the public peace protected at all hazards.
I do not Intend to surround the voUa with
bayonets or Intimidate voters. I do intend that
they shall not be Intimidated and ' '-' act
promptly should necessity artse^ -^let.
The disturbed state of political feeling
In this city was aggravated this evening
by the action of the Board of Election
Commissioners, which Is controlled by
l>emocrats, in removing eighty-seven Re
publican election officers and substituting
for them names submitted by men who,
It Is claimed by the regular Republican
organization, do not represent the party.
While the Commissioners acted within
their technical rights, the removals may j
Le the cause of trouble to-morrow.
The expectation that the Governor will
call out the militia during the day finds
oxpression among men- of, both parties.
The provocation may occur through at- j
tempts of the deposed election officers to [
hold their places or through conflicts with
the police in some of the downtown
wards If the militia is called out it may
result In the closing of the polls by the
local election officers on the ground that

the presence of the soldiers prevented a
free expression of popular will. Or If the
pr>lls remain open It may result In action
by the State election officers throwing out
the vote of Jefferson County on the same
ground of military interference. In either
event the counting or throwing 1 out of the
Louisville vote very likely would deter
mine the result of the election.
The campaign closed to-night with large
meetings, which wore addressed by the
State party leaders. The Democrats
crowded Music Hall to listen to the last
speeches of their leaders, William Goebel
and Senator Blackburn, before the elec
tion. The Republicans held a musing
meeting at the auditorium. Each of
the. State chairmen predicts success for
his ticket and in any guess as to the re
sult reliance must be placed upon pure
chance. The vote of the Brown Demo
cratic ticket Is nn unknown quantity and
it if likely to be ;h<? determining factor.
Late to-night the rumor that the Le
gion lias been ordered to report at tne
armor cfe to-morrow morning to
ho ready in case of emergency was con
firmed. Simultaneously came tne an
nouncement that an extra police force of
Colonel J. B. Castleman
lias been sworn In. The city authorities
evidently Intend to stnnd upon the ground
n vase of trouble they are prepar
â â¢ g to â  ike any necessary measures to
- rye order, and under these eircum
s there can be no occasion for the
calling nut of State troops. Governor
Bradley, It Is reasonably certain, will not
see In this view and a conflict of
;v ;Â« possible.
BOTH CLAIM MARYLAND.
BALTIMORE. Md.. Nov. 6.â Both par
ties ore ready to go to the polls to-mor
row with the leaders of each assuring
their followers of a certain victory.
Chairman Murray Vandiver of the Demo
cratic State Central Committee asserts
that his party will carry Baltimore City
and twenty out of the twenty-three coun
ties In the State, and General Thomas
J. Shryock, the Republican chairman,
concedes to John Walter Smith, the Dem
ocratic candidate for Governor, nothing
save his own countyâ Worcester. The
Democratic prediction is for a plurality
approximating 12,009, while the Repub
publican claims are that Governor
I..Â»wndes will be re-elected by 2000 or 3000
leÂ«s.
Conservative estimates are that the
Democrats will get a plurality of 1200 In
the nine counties on the Eastern Shore
and about the same in Northern-Central
Maryland, which will be overcome proba
bly with several hundred votes to Bpare
by the Republicans in Western and
Southern Maryland, leaving Baltimore
City, with a registered vote of about 110,

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 7, 1899.
Elections will be held in twelve States to-day. Ohio, lowa, Kentucky, Mississippi, Maryland and
Massachusetts will elect Governors and other State officers; Nebraska a Judge of the Supreme Court and
two Regents of the State University; Pennsylvania a Treasurer and a Judge each of the Supreme and
Superior courts; Nebraska three Justices of the Supreme Court, and New Jersey and Virginia Legisla
tures. There are five tickets in Ohio, five in lowa, six in Kentucky, two in Mississippi, three in Ne
braska, two in South Dakota, three in Maryland, five in Pennsylvania and five in Massachusetts. In Kan
sas and Colorado county officers are to be elected and municipal elections will be held in Salt Lake, New
Orleans and Detroit.
In New York State members of the lower branch of the Legislature are to be chosen. County
and judicial officers are to be elected in the four counties of Greater New York.
newspapers save one opposing the Repub
lican candidate. In this fight most of the
newspapers and reformists are with the
Republican State ticket.
Neither of the parties Is holding its own
voters solidly. Former Congressman
Charles E. Coffin of the Fifth District, a
leading Republican, has declared for the
Democratic ticket, and a revolt of con
siderable proportions has been organized
against Congressman Mudd in that sec
tion of the State. Senator Wellington's
friends In Western Maryland and else
where are rather lukewarm in their sup
port of Governor Lbwndes, the Senator
having accused the Governor of treach
ery, and retired at the beginning of the
campaign from the State Committee
chairmanship, which he had held since
IS9d, in which year Governor Lowndes
was elected by 18,000 plurality.
OHIO WILL BE CLOSE.
CINCINNATI, Nov. 6.â There are six
candidates for Governor to be voted for
In Ohio to-morrow. Three of them claim
their election is sure, but no one except
Mayor Samuel M. Jones and his most
zealous supporters make any such
claim as that of the election
of Jones. Jones' vote will re
duce the vote of all the others, including
ing that of the Prohibitionists, the Union
Reform and the Social Labor tickets, and
the result depends very materially on
where most of the Jones vote will come
from.
It is certain that either George K. Nash
(R.) or John R. McLean (D.) will be elect
ed. If Jones pulls more from the Demo
crats than from the Republicans the pre
diction of Chairman Dick that Judge
Nash will have 60,000 pluralty may be
realized; but If Chairman Seward Is cor
rect In assuming that Jones will draw
much more heavily from the Republicans
than the Democrats, then McLean will bÂ«
elected. The Democratic managers have
made much capital of the fact that Jones
had been a Republican up to this cam
paign and that he was himself connected
with a trust and that he would not pledge
himself to vote for Bryan in 1900.
As Ohio is normally a Republican State,
Jones could draw most heavily from the
Republicans and still not affect the result
were It not for the factional feeling which
may also cost Judge Nash some Republi
can votes. It is conceded that all the
votes that can be controlled by Governor
Bushnell, ex-Chairman Kurtz and other
anti-Hanna Republicans will be cast for
McLean; but this factional work may not
extend to others on the Republican State
ticket.

MINNEAPOLIS, Nov. 6.â A special to the Tribune from Ashland, Wis.,

In Wisconsin and Minnesota, Is Just closing another deal which more than
clinches his title as the most extensive manipulator In lumber and logs in
the world. His latest and most stupendous deal Is the purchase of 1,000,000
acres of lumber lands from the Northern Pacific Company. This timber is lo
cated on the Pacific Coast. The price paid is $6,000,000.
This is the largest timber deal ever closed by one person In the history of
the lumbering arid logging industry. In speaking of the deal Mr. Weyerhau

to .advance out in the Western country and that he will realize a handsome
profit.

SPENT THREE YEARS
PORTRAYING HUMANITY
Staying at the California, where they
arrived yesterday from the Doric via the
Hawaiian Islands, are Mr. and Mrs. J.
Hubert Vo.Â«. They will remain in the city
but a few days and then leave for Wash
ington, D.C.. where Mr. Vos goes for the
purpose of seeing the American Commis
sioners to the Paris Exposition relative to
arranging; for the exhibition of some forty
or fifty different pictures, th<> painting of
which has occupied the last three years.
Mr Vos is an artist of note, a Hollander
by birth, but an American by choice, as
he was naturalized some two years ago j
and adopted the stars and stripes as his ;
national emblem, notwithstanding the
fact that he had been decorated some
time before by the Queen of the Nether
lands in appreciation of the excellence of
the work lhat Ills brush had accom
plished.
Mr. Vos some three years ago conceived
ilk> idea at painting the different types of
tbe world's population for exhibition at;
the great V.irls show. He had previously
gone quite thoroughly through the differ
ent European races and, coming to this
country, he put in a year in depicting the
different North American types.
Two years ago he left for the Orient,
where he has remained ever since, work
ing constantly at his self-imposed task.
He now returns with the result of his la
bors, which he will put In as an Ameri
can exhibit and which should certainly
win for him distinction at the world's
great fair.
His studies have been selected from Tla
walians, Javanese, Soudanese Sikhs. Thi
betans, Chinese, Mongolians, Koreans,
Japanese and the Gotticks of Afghanis
tan. The paintings are not individual por
traits, but nre more In the style of com
posite pictures in which the artist has
endeavored to portray the racial charac
teristics of the different peoples of the
Oriental world. During his travels among
the strange tribes of the East Mr. Vos
has had some thrilling adventures and In
several Instance? he has nearly lost his
life for his devotion to his art.
While in Honolulu Mr. Vos became ac
quainted with Mrs. Elenor Kaikilani Gra
ham, a young widow of kanaka blood,
who was acknowledged to be the most
perfect of the many beautiful women In
Hawaiian society. The artist made such I
good use of his time that when he left to I
continue his Journey westward he took
the Bryan Democrats are supporting Mc-
Lean, and there is no factional fuss
among the Democrats. The campaign has
been bitter, dirty and full of charges and
counter charges. It is of course expected
that this vicious tendency will continue
at the polls to-morrow and that there
will be many arrests, especially In the
cities.
OUTLOOK IN BRYAN'S STATE.
LINCOLN. Neb., Nov. 6.â The Nebraska
campaign closed to-night with rallies at
a number of the larger towns. There was
a thinning out at committee headquarters
during the day, but much activity in the
way of sending out final instructions to
precinct workers. Estimates of the chair
men at Republican and Populist head
quarters do not vary greatly, and con
servative men of both sides believe the
result will be close.
In this city and county Judge Reese
(R.), for Supreme Judge, will run ahead
of his ticket slightly, due to his personal
popularity, this being hte home, and his
managers contend that the same rule will
hold good all over the State. They refuse
to admit of the possibility of defeat for
the head of the ticket, but are not so
sanguine for the two university regents.
At the State House, among the fusion
officials who have been stumping the
State for the past month, there is the
greatest confidence in a fusion victory-
Governor Poynter, who accompanied Mr.
Bryan a greater part of the time In his
two weeks of campaigning, said the lat
ter's presence acted as an inspiration, and
If the result was at any time In doubt he
had completely turned the tide. He pre
dicts ex-Governor Holcombe's election by
12.000.
There have been the usual warnings by
both committees to look out for crooked
work, but no trouble at the polls Is ex
pected.
CROKER IS NOT SANGUINE.
NEW YORK. Nov. 6.â At the close of
the campaign the Republicans are confi
dent of electing a majority of the Assem
blymen and the Democrats of carrying
the four countlt-F that make up the city
of New York. Richard Croker said to
night that the, Democrats. Oven If they
carried every Assembly district In New
York City, would still need to make gains
up the State In order to control the As
sembly. Of this he is not hopeful.
"There Is no organization up the State,"
he Bald, "and they made no campaign."
News received to-day points to Demo
cratic Assembly gains In New York City
with him the belle of Honolulu as his wife
and traveling companion.
Remember the vast patronage placed
by the new charter in the hands of
the Mayor renders it imperative to
elect to that office a man of known
fidelity to duty who will not use the
patronage to further his political am
bitions.

The conditions of the suit are very much

OREGON LEAVES ON
MYSTERIOUS VOYAGE
HONGKONG, Nov. 6.â The battleship
Oregon, which intended leaving Tuesday
for Manila, fired a recall gun yesterday
and left port during the night. She Is said
to have received orders to proceed to
Cebu. She was seemingly unprepared for
sea.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 6.â At the Navy
Department it was said that nothing was
known there as to the cause of the Ore
gon's sudden departure from Hongkong or
her destination. If sheis bound for Cebu it
is believed the order must have been given
by Admiral Watson without consulting
the Navy Department.
Cebu is an island in the Philippine
group. Th<rc has been trouble there since
last June, when the native Governor was
slain by forces presumably hostile to
Americans. Two months later a company
of the Twenty-third infantry was am
bushed and three men killed.

MASSACHUSETTS ONE-SIDED.
BOSTON, Nov. 6.â There is no reason to
expect anything but the customary Re
publican victory. Not since ISB2 have the
Democrats carried the State, and to-night
the election of W. Murray Crane, the Re
publican candidate for Governor, Is con
ceded beyond the possibility of a doubt.
The Legislature also will be Republican
by the usual majority, only the manufac
turing centers and this city contributing
to the minority in that body. There are
no State issues and very few local con
tests, so that conditions are more than or
dinarily normal. Good judges place the
Republican majority between 50,000 and
60,000. A falling off of about 15 per cent
from the Republican vote of last year
is looked for, while it seems to be gen
erally agreed that with the help of the
gold Democrats there will be little loss in
the Democratic vote and perhaps a slight
gain.
The Republican State Committee puts
forth no definite figures, asserting only
that the candidate for Governor will poll
from 160,000 to 175,000 votes, while the Dem
ocratic State Committee predicts a vote
of 110,000 for Its candidate, Robert Treat
Paine Jr., and a Republican plurality of
about 40,000.
IN SOUTH DAKOTA.
SIOUX FALLS, Nov. 6.â Any forecast
on the election in South Dakota is pure
prophecy. Not a township in the State
has been polled, and but one thing Is cer
tain, and that Is a light vote will be
polled. Chairman Kidd of the fusion
committee thinks 70 per cent of the vote
will be cast, and Chairman Harrick of
the Republican committee thinks this es
timate is about right. The Populists
have sent thousands of circular letters
STEYN'S ARRAIGNMENT
OF ENGLAND'S TACTICS
NEW YORK, Nov. 6.â The Consul Gen
eral of the Orange Free State in this city
gave out to-day the full text of President
Steyn's proclamation calling on the
Orange Free Stnte Boers to support the
Transvaal. The proclamation reads as
follows:
Burghers of the Orange Free State: The
time, which we had so much desired to avoid,
the moment when we as a nation are com
pelled with arms to oppose injustice and
shameless violence. Is at hand. Our sister re
public to the north of the Vaal River is about
to be attacked by an unscrupulous enemy who,
for many years, has prepared himself and
sought pretexts for the violence of which he
Is now guilty, whose purpose It Is to destroy
the existence of the Afrikander race.
With 'jut Hitter republic we are not only
bound by ties of blood, of sympathy and of
common interests, but also. by formal treaty,
which has been necessitated by circumstances.
This treaty demands of us that we assist her
if she should be unjustly attacked, which we
unfortunately for a long time have had too
much reason to expect. We therefore cannot
passively look on while Injustice is done her
and while also our own dearly bought freedom
is endangered, but are called as men to resist,
trusting the Almighty, firmly believing that he
will never permit injustice and unrighteous
ness to triumph.
Now that we thus resist a powerful enemy,
with whom it has always been our highest
desire to live In friendship, notwithstanding
the injustice and wrong done by him to ua
in the past, we solemnly declare in the pres
ence of Almighty God that we are compelled
thereto by the Injustice done to our kinsmen
and by the consciousness that the end of their
Independence will make our existence as an
Independent state of no significance and that
thÂ»lr fate, should they be obliged to bend
under an overwhelming power, will also soon
after be our own fate.
Solemn treaties have not protected our sister
republic against annexation, against conspira
cy, against the claim of an abolished suzer
ainty, against a renewed attack which aims
only at her downfall. Our own unfortunate
experiences In the past have also made It
sufficiently clear to us that we cannot rely
on the most solemn promises and agreements
of Great Britain when she has at her helm
a government prepared to trample on treaties,
to look for feigned pretexts for every violation
of good faith by her committed. This is proved
among other things by the unjust and unlaw
ful British Intervention, after we had over
come an armed and barbarous black tribe on
mir eastern frontier, as also by the forcible
appropriation of the dominion over part of
our territory, where the discovery of diamonds
had caused the desire for this appropriation,
although contrary to existing treaties. The
desire and Intention to trample on our rights
as an Independent and sovereign nation, not
withstanding a solemn convention existing be
tween this state and Great Britain, have also
been more than once and are now again shown
by the present government, by giving expres
sions in public documents to an unfounded
claim of paramnuntcy over the whole of South
Africa and therefore over this state.
With regard to the South African republic.
Great Britain has moreover refused until the
present to allow her to regain her original
position In respect to foreign affairs, a position
which she had lost In no sense by her own
faults. The original Intention of ihe conven
tions to which the republic had consented under
j pressure and circumstances has been perverted
j and continually been used by the present
British administration as a means for the
practice of tyranny and of Injustice, and among
other things for the support of revolutionary
propaganda within the republic for Great
Britain.
And while no redress has been offered, aa
Justice demands for Injustice done the South
African republic on the part of the British
Government, while no gratitude Is exhibited
for the magnanimity shown at the request of
the British Government to British subjects
| who had forfeited under the laws of the re
public their lives and property, yet no feeling
of shame has prevented the British Govern
ment now that the gold mines of immer;se
value have been discovered In the country, to
make claims on the republic. In consequence
of which, If allowed, will be that those who
or whose forefathers have saved the country
from barbarism nnd have won It for civiliza
tion with their blood and their tears, will lose
their control over the Interests of the country,
to which they are Justly entitled according
to divine and human laws. The consequence
of these claims would be, moreover, that the
greater part of the power will be placed In the
hands of those who. foreigners by birth, enjoy
die privilege of depriving the country of Its
chief trensure while they have never shown
any loyalty to a foreign government. Be
sides, the Inevitable consequence of the accept
ance of these claims would be thÃt the In
dependence of the country as a self-governing.
Independent sovereign republic would be Ir
reparably lost. For years past British troops
In greit numbers have "been placed on the
frontiers of otir sister republic, in order to
compel her by fear to accede to the demands
â which would be pressed upon her and In order
to encourage revolutionary disturbances and
the cunning plans of those whose greed for
gnlrl Is the cause of their shameless under
takings.
Those plans have now reached their climax
in the open violence to which the present
British Government now resorts. While we
readily acknowledge the honorable character
of thousands of Englishmen who loathe such
deeds of robbery and wrong, we cannot but
abhor the shameless breaking of treaties, the
feigned pretexts for the transgression of law,
the violation of International law. and the In
justice and the numerous right-rending- deeds
of the British statesmen who will now force'
a war upon the South African republic. On
their head* be the guilt of blood and may a
Just Providence reward all as they deserve.
Burghers of the Orange Free State: Rls-3
us one man against the oppressor and the vio
lator of rights! In the strife to which we
are now driven have care to commit no deed
unworthy of a Christian and of a burgher
of the Ornnge Free State. Let ub look for
ward with confidence to a fortunate end of
this conflict, trusting tn that higher power,
without whose help human weapons are of no
avail. May he blesa our arms. Under bU

PENNSYLVANIA'S CONTEST.
PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 6.â What little
| Interest :s manifested in to-morrow's elec
tion In Pennsylvania Is centered on the
vote for State Treasurer and partlcularly
as to which of the two prominent candl
; dates for that office will receive the
| greater portion of the big Independent
vote cast in the general elections of the
last two years. Dr. Swallow, the reacher,
editor and Prohibitionist, received 118,964
votes for State Treasurer in 1897 and 131,
--683 votes for Governor in IS9S. In these
years the Republican candidate had plu
ralities, respectively, of 129,717 and 118, 108.
The Swallow vote was cast largely by in
: dependent voters of the leading two par
| ties, who were dissatisfied with the party
Issues or their party leaders. This year
there is no independent candidate to draw
these votes and the Democratic leaders
claim that Creasy, their candidate for
State Treasurer, will benefit from this in
| dependent vote. Furthermore, they claim
| that vigorous efforts to prevent illegal
I voting in this city will result in reduc'ng
i the heretofore large Republican majority
j returned :'rom Philadelphia.
I The Republican State chairman and oth
er party leaders, however, confidently
i claim that Barnett, the Republican candi
date for State Treasurer, will receive the
full party vote and that he will have a
\ majority in the State of at least 175 000.
! The total vote for Governor last year was
I JMiS,OOO, but the general prediction is that
I the vote this year will fall fully 200,000
below these figures.
ALLEN WINS IN MAINE.
PORTLAND, Me., Nov. 6.â Amos L.
Allen, Republican candidate for Con
! gress in the First Maine District, was
I elected to-day by a majority of more
than 4600 votes over Luther F. McKin
ney, the Democratic candidate. With the
town of Dayton, in York County, to
hear from, Mr. Allen's majority is 4657.
Dayton will doubtless reduce this, but
not enough to bring it below 4600.
The First Maine District was Speaker
Reed's district last year, and he had
! ex-Congressman McKinney as his oppo
j nent. At that time Mr. Reed's plurality
I was 5526 over McKinney, but there was
! a prohibition candidate, who polled 673
! votes, thus reducing his majority to 4791.
There were only two candidates this
year, but it is evident from spoiled bal
lots that a considerable number of pro

MARTIAL -LAW IN
SEVERAL NATAL DISTRICTS
LONDON, Nov. 6.â Advices from Cape
Town under date of November 3 say that
martial law has been proclaimed in the
districts occupied by the British troops
between the Orange River and De Aar.
The Premier, \V. P. Schreiner, has sent
a circular to the magistrates and others
warning all persons against statements to
the effect that the Parliamentary institu
tions and constitutional government will
be lost or detrimentally affected. He adds
that the proclamation of martial law is
only a matter of temporary urgency in
some districts and does not compel the
burghers of the colony to participate in
the "deplorable hostilities."
Prince Christian Victor of Schleswig-
Holstein. grandson of Queen Victoria and
a captain in the King's Royal Rifles, and
other officers have left Cape Town for
Ladysmith to replace the dead and
wounded.
The Boer prisoners have been taken on
board the British cruiser Penelope. They
number nine officers and 1&0 men.
An official notice posted at the land
rost'.s office at Vryburg October 2S, refer
ring to the bombardment of Mafekingr.
says: "The big Pretoria gun wrought
great destruction, but the enemy obsti
nately holds his own."
Other advices from Vryburg say the
British flag still floats over Kurumah, but
that a Boer force is about to proceed
thither. The Dotariss command has been
reinforced by 3000 Boers and has gone to
Klmberley.
GENERAL WOLSELEY
TALKS OF THE WAR
LONDON. Nov. 7.â Genera! Lord Wolse
ley, the commander in chief, who was
the guest of the Authors' Club last even
ing, said that the short service system in
the British army had at last been ac
knowledged as the right one, even by its
strenuous opponents.
Discussing the situation in South Africa
the field marshal remarked: "In mv vari
ous commands I have learned much of
Boer character, and I can say truthfully
that the Boers as a people are the most
ignorant with which I have ever been
brought In contact. Their aspiration is to
rule the whole of South Africa. This is
a point the English people must keep
before them. There are ups and downs in
warfare, and the disappointments we
have suffered are having the good effect

hibition square on the official ballot, al
though they had no candidate. Last year
the total vote in the district was 23.570.
This year it amounted to less than 20,000.
Congressman-elect Allen is knnwn in
national life as Speaker Reed's secretary
for many years. Otherwise he was not a
prominent figure, even in his own State
and neighborhood.
QUIET IN KANSAS.
TOPEKA, Kans., Nov. 6.â To-morrow
the elections for county offices will be
held over Kansas. They bid fair to be
the quietest in years. They will close a
campaign which has be** practically de
void of Interest, except where local issues
have been made. Morton Albaugh, chair
man of the State Committee, in an inter
view, makes a prediction for Republican
gains, basing his statement on the gen
eral prosperous conditions prevailing and
satisfaction with the policy of the na
tional administration. The opposition
party leaders have made no statement,
preferring apparently a "still hunt"
policy.
MISSISSIPPI'S FORECAST.
JACKSON, Miss., Nov. 6.â The eve of
the Mississippi State election presents no
features of especial interest. Consider
able sentiment has been manifested
during the past three days in opposition
to the Noel amendment providing for an
elective judiciary, and this awakened in
terest without doubt will have the effect
of bringing a largo number of voters
to the polls. It looks very much a- if
the amendment would be defeated.
Democratic leaders predict a majority
of 35,000 for the party ticket, and the
Populists admit that there will be a de
crease from their vote of 1596, but claim
they will elect members to the Legisla
ture from two and probably three coun
ties.
VIRGINIA'S ELECTION.
RICHMOND, Va., Nov. 6.â The election
in Virginia to-morrow is for a full House
lof Delegates and half the Senate. The
i general Assembly in turn elects a United
! States Senator to succeed Senator Mar
l tin and what are known as Capitol offi-
I cers. The candidates for Senator are Sen
! ator Martin and Governor Tyler. The
i vote throughout the State will be light
'â  and the Legislature will be overwhelm
; ingly Democratic. The canvass has been
! spiritless and very few speeches have
been made.

BULLER'S TASK MAY
BE A VERY HARD ONE
LONDON, Nov. 6.â The movement of
Boers into Cape Colony is beginning to
awaken British fear that they have great-
ly underestimated the forces they will
have to meet and that even General Bul
ler's task may not be so easy as antici
pated.
It is becoming apparent that all the
British calculations based on the loyalty
of the population are hopelessly at sea.
or there has been a very serious leakage
of Dutch sympathizers from Natal and
Cape Colony. Otherwise there is no ac
counting for the large force of burghers
reported from all directions. The War
Ofrice consequently is being urged to have
more troops in readiness for all possible
demands.

SHARKEY POSTS A FORFEIT.
Wants Another Try at Jeffries Four
Months Hence.
, NEW YORK, Nov. Câ As evidence of
good faith on the part of Thomas Sharkey
to arrange another contest with Jeffries
for the. heavy-weight championship of the
world, Tom O'Rourke, the sailor's man
ager, to-day posted a forfeit of $5000 with
George Considine. After posting the
money O'Rcurkf paid that he still had
confidence in Sharkey's ability to defeat
Jeffries.
"Ko man ever gave the champion such
a hard fight as Sharkey," said â¢ I'Rourke,
"and he is clearly entitled to the first
chance. Sharkey wants the fight to take
place within four months. His broken
ribs have mended nicely and ho will soon
be himself again. lie thinks that he will
be in perfect condition to fight within
four months. That Sharkey is a wonder
ful pugilist his marvelous showing against
the Californinn demonstrates. Although
suffering mU'iine physical pain as the re
eult of his injuries he not only prevented
Jeffries knocking him out, but was ! old-
Ing liis own with the big fellow at the
end."
Sharkey, v.-ho was confined tn his room
in the Mai-tin House yesterday, suffering
from the punishment inflicted by Jeftrios'
Mows !n tho fight last Friday night, was
much betf-r to-day and he was able to
move around with porfe^t freedom. He
told me that he was feeling "first rate."
When Jr.ff.rieÃ was informed of Siiar
key's forfeit having boon posted he said
that he would not fight again for some
time.
" I need a rest," said the champion; "and
I moan to take one. I will not arrange
another match for at least six or seven
months. When 1 fight again Sharkey will
Probably i.i my opponent."
Although the pictures of a few rounds
of the bi;j fight were obtained by a rival
company, the officials of the mutoscope
and hlofrnph are by no means alarmed.
"William A. Brady arid O'Rourke said that
they regarded the action of the rival com
pany as blackmail and would take legal
methods fo prevent an exhibition.

CLEVER CHICAGO FIGHTER
TO MEET ALEC GREGGAINS
m /""\ N November 15 Alec Greg-grains will mingle with Jack Root, the Chicago Â£
-*- 1 I cyclone, before the Western Club, whoso fistic rxhibitions are held at >
6 11 Woodward's Pavilion. Greggains is known to all followers of the prize- O
â¢Â¥ *"â¢â¢' ring sport, but Root 1b a stranger to San Franciscans, coming here with â +
Â© a local record of unblemished victories and a reputation that stands for 6
X something among the pugilists. +
V Quite a crowd of men of sporting proclivities visited Root yesterday after- Q
A noon at his training quarters, Croll's Gardens, Alameda. Root was at the sta- A
V tlon to receive them, and not long after their arrival stripped for action. He V
Â© is in very fair condition and worked for over an hour, demonstrating to all X
+ that he is a fighter of no mean ability. v
6 Root is the kind of a fighter that glories, In work. Although not a top- $
â r- notcher, he combines cleverness and speed with agility and vigor of youth, a
2 He has a good punch, and judging from the work he did yesterday can stand Q
the wear and tear of a long fight. Ills greatest trick is at the punching bag, >
: 9 and at this sort of work he compares favorably with the best in the business. Q
Z. At present Root tips the scales at 160 pounds, but will weigh In at the ring- +|
! X side a few pounds less. He is not as heavy nor as tall as Greggains, but what O
X he lacks in these two particulars is more than offset by his activity and -f
X youthful strength. Greggains moved his traps to the Six-Mile House yester- O
: 6 day morning and will do his work at that place. >

heavy-weight champl >n, the contract ex
isting between William A. Brady and the

ed. Th< agreement on the part of Brady

Sharkey contest," the brother continued,
"Jim is now worth at least Jli^.onj, and
be will make more from now on, as he
has many engagements to fill, if Brady
has Bigned .liui again it will be on an en
tirely new basis."
While' John admits that the company
Jim now travels with Is a little faster
than it formerly was In Los Angeles, Still,
he says, the champion is prudent and
thrifty, and, while He may be liberal, he
will not throw his coin away.
"When Jim was hep. ho gave mother
a big wad." J"hn said. "She has put
that in the bank for him. and it has been
increased by his remittances."
His brother is under the impression
thai the champion may come here
this whiter and may fro to Catalina, where
he "ill lie undisturbed and rest and do
his wnrk in the open air while camping
and bunting.

should be given as soon as the police gave
the siKnal to stop, and the contest was
awarded to Denny.

Eldn dge of llilo brought charges of gross
cheating against the two fighters, alleg
ing that they had both told him that the
light was fixed for Armstrong to win and
that he had wagered $530 on the result.
He- alleged that the fight had been a fake.
: Tho case was nolle pressed and Eldredge
then made a charge of conspiracy, filing
: an information against the two fishers
;in the District Court. He avers that they
conspired together to cause him to bet on
â¢ Armstrong and then carried out a con
spiracy to have Armstrong defeated.
Yesterday afternoon Marshal Brown
said he would arrest all bettors on
charges of gambling. There was a large
1 crowd at the ringside in Independence

General Redvers Buller Compelled to
Change His Plan for the Invasion of the
Transvaal â Some Fighting Near Lady
smith, but the British War Office With
holds Information.
LONDON. Nov. 7.â The Daily Telegraph, speaking oF
Great Britain's naval preparations, says this morning :
"A particular service squadron, consisting of Four
of the swiFtest cruisers in the navy, will be completed
to-day, and atter coaling it will await orders from the
Admiralty. This squadron will probably make even
more effective than at present the great patrol of the
ocean now being carried out by our warships along the
whole coast of Africa. The Channel squadron is at
Gibraltar, while cruisers are at Las Palmas, St. Vin
cent and other points on the route to the Cape. Brit
ish warships are continually passing and repassing
through the Suez Canal."
LONDON, Kov 7, 4:3(1 a. m.â This morning-*? news carries public knowledge
with respect to hostilities in South Africa very little further than the
evacuation of Colenso and Storrr\berg. These movements, taken together
with the Admiralty announcement that the public must not be disappointed
should the transports not reach their destination on the dates Indicated in
the published lists, may indicate some change of plan necessitated by the bad po
muf affairs In Natal. It was expected that the army corps would land
:â¢* Town for an invasion of 'ho Transvaal through the Orange Free
State, but the landing may now be diverted to Durban, Natal, whither it la
fully expected Lieutenant General Sir Redvers Buller will go within a week to in
vestigate the situation for himself.
There is also possibility of a movement through Delagoa Bay. and the Ad
mlralty notice regarding the transports simply means, in all likelihood, that news
of their * movements is to be suppressed. Stormberg was understood to be the
depot where store! ts, guns, ammunition and all the commissariat detail of
the Third Division were In process of accumulating. The stores have been re
mov urn and an obvious explanation of their removal arises from
the Boer advance from Bethulie and Aliwal North.
In view of the near approach of British reinforcements, Boer invasion of
t'npp Colony could hardly be regarded very seriously. There may. therefore, be
another reason for the withdrawal and the stores destined by repute for
Queenstown may be intended for East London or Durban. It may be General
Buller's intention to send on Colonel Lord Paul Methuen's division, composed
of Guards and British brigades, to thÂ« Immediate assistance of Natal. For the
use of that division a diversion may be intended of some of the stores of the
Third Division, which are in the hardest position to be forwarded.
Reports that Rose Mead and Naauwpoort are also to be evacuated all seem to
corroborate the idea that General Buller's lirst business will be to relieve Sir
George Stewart White.
.Â»d that the Orange Free State now has 11,000 men concentrated
against. Kimberley and on the Free State southern frontier. Opposed to them
are only TumO British troops. The towns which He open to their attack are Ali
wal North. Burghersdorp, Bteynburg, Barkley and Moletto.
A dispatch from Pietermaritzburg dated Friday reports that railway com
munication with Ladysmlth is severed, the Boers having effected a lodgment at
Noltorpe, south of Ladysmlth about seven miles. Among those invested at
...smith are Colonel Rhodes, brother of Cecil Rhodes, Sir John Willoughby
: it is believed, Dr. Jameson, as well as most of the press correspondent
â¢ ably the Earl of Ava, son of the Marquis of Dufferin and Ava. Ail the ('ape
railroads are now in the hands of the military authorities. Five hundred toi
â¢.stuffs were seized on board the steamship Maria, at Hurl. an, consigned to
:"or the Transvaal. Twenty missionaries have arirved at l>urban
from Swaziland after many narrow escapes.
It is reported from Boer sources that the big gun with which General Cronje
had hoped to demolish Mafeking is not a success. It is believed to be a
Sch: net gun, weighing, with the cartridges, about ten tons. The recoil
nendous as to throw the gun out of gear every time it is fired. After
using pon two days the Boers gave it up.
The Morning Post hears from Maseru, Bamitoland, that the Boer attempt to
lnci*' gainst the British has failed.
It is ! that when the time comes to arrange terms of peace Natal
will claim an apportionment of territory which, beside recompensing 1 the colony
for l.>s<es sustained, will place it in a position less open to attack in the future.
Then â¢ wed rumors of another engagement at Elands Laagte with se
vere- Boer losses.
It Is reported from Cairo that the German steamer Zanzibar, bound for Zan
zibar, arrived at Port Said without passeno-rs and that, having embarked thirty

NO NEWS, BUT PLENTY
OF THRILLING RUMORS
LONDON, Nov. 7.â The War Office an- |
nounced at midnight that no dispatches !
hail been received beyond those already i
ma.de public and that nothing furtner |
would be i.ssued before noon to-day. Thus \
not a solitary' official item of news has I
been posted for nearly twenty-four hours, j
This has given rise to a crop of rumors |
that Ladysrr.lth's ammunition is exhaust- ,
ed: that Sir George Stewart White is mor- |
tally wounded; that both facts are being
concealed and that other unlucky hap- I
penir.gs have taken place. For all of these j
reports there Is absolutely no foundation. |
At the same â¢.me the Britisher has had |
little to j-timulate him within the last :
twenty-four hours except the news of the
confident attitude of the Ladysmith garri- j
eon and its slight successes last Tnursday
and Friday.
Advices from other parts of South Af- :
rica are distinctly unpalatable arm every- |
thing points to a critical situation in Na- ;
tal and the northern portions of Cape
Colony, likely to grow more acute until
General White Is either relieved or de
cisively defeated. Nobody dares to think
of capitulation. Rather than that he is ,
expected. 111 last resort, if Ladysmith be- i
comes untenable, to make a desperate ef
fort to cut his way through the Boers j
back into lower Natal and to join hards ,
â¢with the garrison there, which is now al
most certain to be reinforced by the first \
arrivals of the corps from England and :
to be pressed forward to renew touch
with him. ,; : . n._*
It la generally assumed, however, that
General White, with the aid of the naval
guns, will be able to cope with any oom
bardmont. and the Idea that the Boers
could take Ladysmith by assault Is scout- â 
ed as absurd. The defense thus depends
on the uninterrupted working of the na
val guns. Right here arises the impor
tant questions; upon which the dispatches
have thrown no light, whether thenavaJ
guns, which themselves only armed at .
the last moment, have with them suffl- ,
dent ammunition to reply to abombard- ,
ment lasting possibly several â wee.ts. it
not it is hafdlV. likely that works^ Â«Â£Mii

siderations explain the anxiety felt re- ,
pardins General White's movements and

official circles. _ . . . â_
The British retirement to Estcourt has
given the impression that it is Intended
to make a stand there. Estcourt is the
lasÂ»t important town between the 'â¢"'â¢' s
und the capital of Ladysmith and If the
Boers sweep past Estcourt nothing can
stop them from laying siege to Pletermar
itzburg. which cannot be expected to
make a protracted defense, while Its fall
would be a tremendous blow to I'.ntisn
prestige throughout South Africa.
Already the British retirement south of
Colen has given the Boers an oppor
tunity to make a bid for the active sup
port of the disaffected Dutch in Natal
by proclaiming the annexation of the
upper Tugela section. Thus far the Dutch
colonists si-om to have confined their sym
pathy with the invading Boers to a pla
tonlc emotion. Except for surreptitious
assistance there is no evidence that they
have yet joined the Boers openly in any
appreciable numbers. !
The reported British retirement from
Btormberg Junction, however, will be fol
lowed doubtless by a similar Boer procla
mation annexing the portions of Cape
Colony lying directly south of the Orange
Free State. These proclamations, as in
the cose of Bechuanaland, have been and
will be immediately followed by British
counter proclamations, but to the eyes ut
the Dutch farmers the presence of one
Boer commando is probably more impre.-s-
Bive than the expectation of the arrival
of the whole British army in the more or
less distant future.
The British newspapers publish a list
of the transports due to arrive at Capo
Town from to-day. According to this
some 20,000 men should reach the cape by
the end of next week, but the admiralty
Issued a chilling warning last evening to
the effect that no disappointment must
be felt by the public if the transports
should not arrive at the dates mentioned
dates, which the War Office Bays, are
"based In many cases upon too sanguine
expectations."
The French press has been cheerfully
announcing me issue or letters of marque
by the Transvaal Government and pre
dicts the havoc which privateers may
work among British merchantmen anil
?ven transports. In this Paris Journalism
linds In part an explanation for the mob
ilization of the British special service
squadron. The view taken by the German
press of the same matter is interesting.
Berlin Journalism treats the suggestion
Df privateering with skepticism. The V"O3
sische Zeitung says: "Privateering Is no
longer recognized by International law
and the Transvaal is not in a position to
issue letters of marque, as it possesses
neither ports nor harbors. Attempts at
privateering must, consequently, be re
garded, not only by Great Britain, but
by neutral powers, as unlawful warfare
and to be treated as common piracy. ''
The American hospital fund is Increas
ing steadily. More than Â£11,000 is now In
hand, Including Â£1000 from Mrs. Samuel
Newhouse and Â£100 each from Mrs. Eu
gene Kelley and Mrs. C. P. Huntington.
The executive committee decided that the
whole personnel of th ship, doctors,
nurses and crew shall come from the
United States, the only Englishman being
the chief medical officer.
An allied fund will be opened in Paris.
Mr. Hargc-s of Drexel, Harges & Co. has
Issued a call for a meeting to form a com
mittee. Lady Randolph Churchill has sent
him the following telegram: "The execu
tive committee thanks you for your co
operation and hopes you may work as ef
fectively as we are working here."
Last evening her Majesty wired In re
ply to a telegram from the Crimea Vete
rans' banquet at Portsmouth: "The
Queen vividly recalls your campaign and
feels sure that the Crimean veterans
must feel proud of their younger com
rades now fighting in South Africa."
The Daily Mall has received the follow
ing dispatch from Stormberg, dated last
Friday evening:
"An Orange Free State force 2000 strong
is now at Pewns farm, half wav between
the Orange River and Burghersdorp The-
Boers are waiting there for the arrival of
jooo reinforcements from Rouxvllle and

Twenty Boer horses were killed and the

ly, dispels colds, headaches and fevers
and overcomes habitual constipation

many ills resulting therefrom. The
great trouble with all other purgatives

that they act too violently and inva-

HEAVY FIGHTING
NEAR LADYSMITH
ESTCOI'RT. Natal. Saturday. Nov. 4,
4 p. m. â It is reported that the Boers lost
800 in killed and wounded and captured
in Thursday's battle on Tatham's farm,
near Ladysmith.
ESTCOURT, Natal, Saturday, Nov. 4,
noon.â A reliable messenger has just ar
rlved from Ladysmith, passing the Boer
lines during the night, who reports that
heavy fighting occurred on Thursday
around Ladysmith. The heat of the en
gagement was on George Tatham's farm,
; views the British Government's policy
i and even holds out little hope for peace
S after the war. It says:
"Rhodes' former policy of working with
the Dutch was what might be termed a
liberal imperialist policy. but when
Rhodes lost patience and when the Jame
son raid failed it became obvious that the
Colonial Office had. to all intents and
purposes, adopted Rhodes' new views.
The Dutch on their side became suspi
cious. The Transvaal In particular hard
ened its heart against the Uitlanders and
devoted itself to arming in defense of its
Independence. For three years we let

ATTENTION, REPUBLICANS!
. 1 J ITH iteration and reiteration Phelan, his or- ;
Y\/ gans and his friends have declared this elec- j
rion to be virtually a non-partisan contest, a
struggle in which national issues are not at stake,
cue with which national parties have nothing to do.
All such declarations, however, have been made for
Republican consumption. There has been a different
doctrine taught in Democratic circles and to Demo
cratic ward bosses.
Yesterday noon there was conspicuously dis- i
played in Phelan's evening organ a letter from An- i
drew S. Hallidie protesting against foisting national i
.' or party politics into municipal elections. That let- !
ter was designed to entice Republicans into voting
for Phelan, its object was to induce as many of them
as possible to turn aside from their own party and
its honored leader to vote for Phelan.
In the same issue there appeared a notice of what
the organ called an enthusiastic meeting held at j
Democratic headquarters of the Thirty-third Assem- j
bly District under the auspices of the county com- j
mittee, delegates to the late convention and repre
sentative members of the Democratic party of the
district. At that meeting, according to the Phelan
organ itself, there was unanimously adopted the fol- j
lowing resolution: "Resolved, That any member of
. the Democratic party found working against any â 
candidate on the Democratic ticket be read out of the j
Democratic party of the Thirty-third Assembly Dis
trict."
Mark the contrast! Republicans are told to protest
against "foisting" national politics into a municipal
campaign. Democrats are warned that if found work
ing against the party ticket they will be read out of
. the party. It is to be a non-partisan year for Re- ;
publicans, but a strictly partisan year for Democrats.
That is the Phelan dodge.
Is it possible any intelligent Republican can be
â  taken in by such a political flim-flam me as that?
Mr. Phelan is an artful dodger indeed, but can he
work so transparent a trick with success before the
open eyes of men of common sense?
It is not in one district only, that the Democratic
bosses have lined up all the push and pull of their j
party and have begun cracking the whip over the rank ;
and file. Throughout the city the Democrats will
be brought to the polls to vote their party ticket, and !
if Phelan win the fact will be hailed as a victory for !
Democracy. It is only to Republican ears the Phe
lanites talk of eliminating party politics from the con
test.
â¢ The issue is before Republicans. Are they to per- I
mit themselves to be deceived by such a confidence j
game as that which has been attempted and exposed,
'or will they stand up for their party, rebuke hypo
critical pretense and win a victory for the party of
jjroipcrity and the prosperity of the city?
*
The managers -ii Mayor Phelan must believe that I
. ht is. either very heavy or very light. He must be \
Otic or the other when the entire Democratic ticket ;
. h to iff, sacrificed to save him from the wreck of i
;,Â«,->-'â' tii',,'. ambitions.

"T~" HE elections in Eastern States to-day will have a great influence on party leadership,
party action and the fate of parties in the campaign of 1900. But it is not saying too
much to say that the election in this city, in all those respects, ranks in importance with
the result in many States. On the alignment of 1896 President McKinley carried Cali
fornia by a very narrow margin. The total vote was 298,072, of which McKinley had
146,472, Bryan 1 44. 760. 1 'aimer 1730, Levering 2562, Bentley 931, and Matchett 1611,
leaving McKinley with a plurality over Bryan of 1706, but in the minority of the whole
vote of 5133.
In the gubernatorial election of 1898 the total vote was 287,055, of which Gage re
ceived 148.354, Maguire 129,261. llarriman 5143, and McComas 4297, giving Gage a
majority over all of 9653. San Francisco, Alameda, Sacramento and Santa Clara gave an
aggregate Republican majority of 10,017, without which the party would have been
beaten. The total vote was 11,017 short of the total of 1896. Maguire's vote fell oft
15,505 from Bryan's, and Gage gained 2882 on McKinley. Add to Maguire's vote the
is. 505 Democrats who snubbed the polls, and Gage would have been in a minority of the
total vote of 5852, or atrille more than McKinley's minority in 1896.
These figures should teach and exhort Republicans as to the political condition of
this State and their duty in to-day's election. Phelan can be elected only by Republican
votes. Every man with sense enough to mark his ticket knows what will be the effect of
such election. It will mean the getting together of all elements of the opposition in a
gigantic effort to carry the State next year. True blue Republicans have done their duty
in this campaign. They have spared no legitimate means to win a victory for clean mu
nicipal government in the hands of their party as an argument for the support of its ticket
next year. That the party needs this victory should be well understood by every Repub
lican. The Phelan Democrats are making no mistake about it. They feel that the issue
is vital in its bearing on next year's contest. They are perfectly aware that nothing suc
ceeds like success. They know that if they can coax Republicans to elect Phelan and de
feat 1 )avis the steadfast element in the party will tire of being defeated by bolters. They
know that the bolters themselves will be out next year calling Republicans to stand by
their ticket, and that the spectacle will make indifferent thousands of good Republicans
who will be still stung by this year's defeat. The Phelan-McXab-Rainey combination,
while professing to bolting Republicans to be harmless as a dove, is as wise as a serpent.
With a so called Republican Mayor in Oakland maundering his support to Phelan.
while holding an office given him by a straight party vote, the disease with which Phelan
is attempting to inoculate Republicanism here will spread there, and California will either
be lost to the party next year or saved by an exhausting effort. If a Republican lag in
his duty to-day and do it not, he need expect no sympathy when the consequences of his
neglect are upon him.
DISHONORABLE TACTICS.
WHEN Joseph Britton, after accepting a nomi
nation for the office of Supervisor from the
Republican party, waited until the last mo
ment and then deserted, giving his party a stab in
the back as he went, it was believe. l Mich dishonor
able tactics would not soon be repeated in San Fran
cisco politics. The unexpected, however, has hap
pened. A. S. Hailidie has become an imitator of
Britton. He also has deserted his party, an<l nas
timed his desertion so that his attack could neither be
guarded against nor refuted.
Honorable men will not envy the record made by
these allies of Phelan. If Britton had an honest be
lief that the Phelan ticket was better than any the
Republicans could nominate he should have stood for
Phelan from the start. There was evidently a design
in the trick he played, and the design does more
credit to his cunning and his malice than to his sin
cerity or his self-respect.
Haliidie has had week? of time in which to an
nounce his protest against a consideration of na
tional politics in this campaign. During the whole
period of debate and discussion he kept silent. His
course was as secret and as sneaking as that of a
Â«nake in the grass. When he thought it too late for
Horace Davis to reply, Hailidie struck at him. That
is the record. If such dishonorable tactics profit
Phelan anything we mistake the sentiment of the peo
ple of San Francisro.
When Mayor Phelan was heralded as the "hero"
of a gallant rescue of a fireman, who had already
been placed beyond the reach of harm, it was not
suspected that his Honor was making the prelimin
ary pose of the tableau that makes him politically
the central figure of the Fire Department.
EVIDENCES OF PROSPERITY
REPORTS from the Atlantic seaboard States are
to the effect that the demand? of traffic have far
exceeded the ability of the transportation com
panies. Ships are said to be waiting at the docks for
! cargoes that have not arrived, merchants wait for the
delivery of goods ordered long ago, and the internal
trade of the country is retarded by v lack of cars to
carry it on.
A striking illustration of the extern to which the
demand for transport:' ion exceeds the present ca
pacity of the railways is given in the fact that two
railways alone, the Pennsylvania and the New York
Central, have recently placed orders for 15,000 coal
and freight cars. It is to be noted, moreover, that
| these cars are to be of the . parity! About
j twenty-five years ago the ordinary freight car had a
capacity of 20,000 - [improvements in railway
beds, in locomotives and in car construction admitted
I an increase in the capacity of freight cars by rapid
degrees, and it is said the ne 1 ir the two great
trunk lines named will have c ich a capacity of Bo,ooc
pounds. Thus the number of cars ordered will be
I equal in carrying capacity to 60.000 cars of a quarter
of a century ago.
The orders given by the Pennsylvania and the New
York Central roads have attracted attention by rea
son of their magnitude. Those, however, are not the
Ânly lines which have placed orders for cars and loco
motives. The traffic of the country growing out of its
abounding prosperity has everywhere exceeded tho
ity of the transportation companies to properly
. handle it. and almost every important railway in the
ion is in the market purchasing increased equip
ment"; for freight and for passenger service.
The vast augmentation of traffic which has made
necessary the demand for such an increase in the
freight equipments of our roads has been due of
j course to the abounding prosperity of the country,
and that in turn rests in no small measure upon the
j legislation which has given confidence to the business
interests and industries of the people. The same con
dition of crops and harvests would riot mean pros
perity for the people at large if our manufacturer*
wre exposed to the competition of foreign cheap la
bor, or if our finances were subject to the meddling
and muddling of free silver or fiat money statesmen.
Out of these evidences of prosperity, therefore, can
he drawn added reasons why the intelligent business
and working men of the country should give their
support to the party of sound money and protection
m every contest which arises, whether in city, or
i State, or nation. The difference between good and
bad legislation can be estimated by the difference be
j tween the good year* we are now enjoying and the
j bad years of the Democratic regime.
Sharkey still insists that he wasn't whipped. He
evidently believes that his tongue is an invincible
weapon.
THE SAX FUANCTSCO (ALL, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 7, 1899.
TO-DAY'S ELECTION.
jT\ CCORDING to reports from Washington our
' \ Government has been informed that Italy i>
persisting in her claims for a port and a sphere
of influence in China in order to be on something like
equal terms with other European nations. It is said
to be the intention of the Italians to occupy San
Mun and use that as a basis from which to extend
Italian trade and build up Italian interest? in China
as extensively as circumstances admit.
In a certain sense our Government has nothing to
do with the claims of Italy in China any more than
with the demands of the Russians or the Germans, the
British or the French. It has been announced that
the United States has given notice to the powers that
we will take no part in the partition of China, and
will make no efforts to obtain a port there, but will
insist that the trade rights of the merchants of the
United States be respected and guaranteed even in
those parts of China which have passed under the
"influence" of other nations.
The policy outlined is the right one for us to fol
low. Without any port or sphere of influence of our
own in the past we have built up a considerable trade
with China, and it is steadily increasing. Our trade
is not with any particular district, but with the em
pire of China, and it would be foolish on our part to
surrender the right to trade with the whole empire
for the sake of obtaining a port and a district such
as the European nations are struggling for.
Secretary Hay is reported to have given the various
European powers to understand that this Government
proposes that the provisions of its treaties with China
shall be observed even in the spheres of influence
which each has obtained, and, to make certain that
such observances shall be continued, American repre
sentatives have been directed to gain written guaran
tees that n,o restrictions will be placed upon American
commerce.
Such representations on our part will not be ig
nored. Since the Spanish war the United States has
been recognized as a world power of the first rank,
and our prestige in the Pacific is too great for any
nation to willingly challenge. It is altogether prob
able, therefore, that our trade interests in China wi'.J
be respected so far as we ourselves maintain them,
and, fortunately, our statesmen are now so well aware
of the value of the commerce of the Orient they will
not be neglectful of our opportunities there.
If the women who are agitating from one end of
the continent to the other for the removal of Con
gressman Roberts do nothing more they will have
given the Mormon elder an international name.
Â» a ANY and various are the arguments put forth
/ \ by the imperial press of the country to stts
* * tain the contention that in the war in South
Africa the sympathy of the American people should
be with the British rather than with the Boers. One
of these is sufficiently curious to be worth noting as
an illustration of the extent of the ambitious dreams
of our imperialistic fellow citizens. As expressed by
the Philadelphia Record it runs in this way:
"The Muscovite and the English-speaking races
are gradually dividing the earth between them.
America has become the most energetic exemplar of
English push; but it is Great Britain alone that
gives to this country free access to all the markets
which she controls. For this reason, if for no other,
it is to our advantage that the British empire should
be extended. And as to the future â is not the heri
tage all to be ours? Certainly, unless Great Britain
herself should prefer that her great empire shall pass
to strangers to her blood, institutions and language.
Great Britain's pre-eminence has been built by her
sturdy sons upon her iron, coal and fleets. She can
not possibly sustain her fleets when the iron and
coal shall be gone. The center of empire must then
drift to the -United Statesâ the center of powc-
giving production."
That is to say, the British are to exhaust their
coal, iron and energy in conquering about half the
globe, and then the United States are to enter upon
the field ns heirs of the British empire and take pos
session of the estate. The British, therefore, are not

It is an excellent view to take of the subject, but
has the drawback of presenting the American eagle

ARRANGING MATTERS.
"This fishing trip isn't going to bÂ© a
success without you," said Oiggton,
earnestly, "and I hope that you won't dis
appoint UK."
Whittler shrugged his shoulders with
an air of careless indifference. "I ad
mit," ho said, "that I shall have to ar
range matters with my wife; but I
haven't been married five years for
nothing, and you can count on me."
"I knew you would go," said Giggton,
confidently.
"You can bet on me every time." said
Whittier. "So, au revoir, old man. To
morrow morning at 7:30."
Jumping, on a car, he passed the next
twenty minutes In arranging his method
oi' procedure, and one hour later he sat
at the dinner table with his wife â on his
face ;'H expression of listlessness, and an
unnatural stoop to his usually erect
shoulders.
"What's the matter, dear?' said Mrs.
Whittler; "you don't eat anything. "
Whittler smiled feebly. "Nothing," he
s.-iid. with a half-hearted atti-mpt at
brightness. "I'm feeling a little stale,
that's all. Been working too hard, I
guess."
"You do look rather tired," said his

"That's just it," said Whittler, despair
ingly. "I'm nervous and run down, and

A DEGREEâ R.. City." The length
of a degree of latitude is the length of an

the length of an arc -of the section of the
figure of the sea level by a plane parallel
to the equator, the difference of longitude
between the extremities of this arc being
one degree. This is nearly proportional to
the cosine. of Latitude, and is equal to
60.16 statute miles or 60 geographical mixes
at the equator. A geographical or naut
ical mile is approximately 2025 yards,
while an English statute mile is 1760 yards.
EXCEPTIONâ S., Napa, Cal. "Excep
tion proves the rule" is from the Latin
law maxim, "Exceptio probat regulam do
rebus non exceptisâ a special exception to
a rule, (to hold) concerning things not
(specially) excepted. The first three
words of this maxim are often misapplied
as meaning "the fact of there being an
exception proves the existence of the
! rule," or "an exception is essential to
every rule." This proverbial saying is
very" generally misunderstood. The word
"prove" anciently meant test, and is so
used in this saying. An old use of the
word "prove" occurs in the advice to St.
Paul, "Prove all things," etc., which
means that we should test all things, so
as to know which good ones to hold fast
to. An exception cannot prove a rule in.
the modern sense; it tends rather to ren
der it invalid; but an exception may test
a rule, and in some cases prove it to be
wrong, while in others the test may show
that the so-called exception may be ex
! plained. Another theory on the subject
is that the very word "exception" implies
that there is a rule; so that the word
i "prove" means "proves the existence of."
HATSâ W., City. Hats were first
â  made by a Swiss in Paris in 1404, but his
name is not given. When Charles VII
made his triumphal entry into Rouen, in
1449. he wore a hat lined with red velvet,
! surmounted with a rich plume. Hence
forward, hats and caps, at least in
; France, began to take the place of cha
prons and hoods. Hats were first manu
factured in England by Spaniards in 1510.
It Is evident that prior to the manufac
ture of hats in England they were Im
! ported, for in Fifth Henry VII, Â»48Â», there
i is a law that provides that "none shall
[ be allowed to Bell any hat for above 20
pence, nor cap for above 2 shillings 8
pence." In 1571 in that country the law
| required "every person above 7 years of
; age to wear on Sunday and holidays, a
cap of wool. knit. made, thickened and
dressed in England By some of the trade
of cappers, under the forfeiture of three
i farthings for every day's neglect," but
I this law excepted ''maids, ladies and gen
tlewomen, and every lord, knight and
i gentleman of twenty marks of land, and
! their heirs, and such as had borne office
of worship in any city, town or place, and
the wardens of London companies."

SENTENCING OF
WARDNER RIOTERS
Ten Men Sent to San
Quentin.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MOSCOW, Idaho, Nov. 6.â The culmin
ating scene In the long drawn out labor
troubles in the Coeur d'Alene mining re
gion was enacted In the Federal Court
here this afternoon when the ten men
found guilty of interfering with the
United States malls near Wardner during
the riots of April "i 1 were sentenced by
Judge Beany to each Berve twenty-two
months In the United States prison at San
Queniin. CaL, and each to pay a nne of
$1000, with the exception of Dennis
O'Rourke who. on account of his youth,
gets off with twenty months and a fine
of. $1000. Addressing the prisoners Juage
"Beetty said:
"You have been indicted by a Grand
Jury convicted by a trial jury and it de
volves upon me to pronounce your sen
tence."
msel for defense moved that Judg
ment be suspended for twen:y hours
pending evidence which the riÃoners
hoped would alleviate their sentence. This
Judge Beattj declined to grant, saying
that the. trial had been thorough and fair
and he had fully decided upon vhat he
should do. Then a motion for arrest of
Judgment was made, defendants claiming
that the charges upon which they were
â  ted were not In accordance with
the law. Judge Beatty overruled the mo
tion and proceeded to a summary of the
cases preliminary to pronouncing sen
tence. He spoke of th.> lamentable nature
of the affair, expressing regret for the
prisoners, but saying he had to perform
his duty of enforcing the law.
As enon as the sentences vere pro
nounced court was adjourned until 10
â k to-morrow and the prisoners were
taken back to the Latah County jail,

FORGERY!
A Bogus Religion Circular Sent Through the Mails Repudiated by
Young Men's Institute as a Fraud on the Public.
VOTERS, ATTENTION!
A printed circular calculated to arouse religious prejudice in connection with
t) municipal election was distributed through th< medium of" the Vnited
81 tes mails yesterday. The circular purported to have been issued on behalf of
the y. .;i!iÂ« Men's Institute. This is an absolute forgerj and has been denounced
by the officers of the Young Men's Institute in tin- following letter, it is tv be
hoped that no American citizen will be Influenced by sm-h reprehensible meth-
ods, practiced only by political assassins:
There was pent broadcast through ti:!- mails this morning a printed circular
falpeiy purporting to emanate from the Young Men'a Institute, and admirably
calculated to excite religious animosities and inject them into thr> present cam-
paign.
The circular is headed with a cross and the headline. "Brothers, Attention,"
and proceeds to call attention to the fact that certain mi' ih>- nominees of the
respective parties ;ir-- of the Catholic faith, and connected with the Young Men's
Institute. It then proposes to the members of that society the capture n( Amer-
ica, beginning with Ban Francisco, to th< end that there maj b< "no place for
Jews. Protestants or other heretic:-:" The circular concludes, "Remember your
obligation. Do your duty."
As the matter of the circular is so overdrawn and patently ridiculousâ as
the true Bource of the screed seems to us so perfectly obvious we would Ignore
it l"-,t that another phase of the affair is so serious.
Th.- circular is a contemptible forgery, it did not and could not emanate from
the Young Men's Institute, or from any one friendly thereto. It i- ;i wicked
forgery, for it attempts to fasten upon us opinions and methods which we
di test and abhor with all our hearts. ,
The writer of an anonymous letter has eve;- . red a fit object for
the detestation of decent men. What shall he said of those who resort to the
. ry of documents in the attempt to blacken the characti rs and besmirch the
motives of a large body of useful and patriotic citizens'. 1 Yours respectfully

OIN THE
MUNICIPAL ELECTION.
One of the principal objects sought by the new charter was to bring
about separate municipal elections. That is to say, it provided in the
charter that municipal elections shall be held on the first Tuesday after
the first Monday in November, 1899, and in every second year there-
after. In this way municipal elections will be held in the odd numbered
years and will be wholly separate from the State and national elec-
tions that are held in the even numbered years. The Freeholders who
framed the charter believed that one of the evils in municipal elections
was the confusion brought about by the introduction of State and na-
tional issues. The questions involved, being matters of strictly munici-
pal concern, should be considered and voted upon from a standpoint of
purely civic interest.

TESTIMONY CLOSES
IN SUISSER CASE
SALINAS, Nov. 6.â A pathetic scene was
enacted at the trial of George Suisser
this morning. The mother of the as
sassin tearfully related how strangely
her son had acted before the murder. Tne
appearance of the broken-hearted parent
on the stand visibly affected the prisoner,
but Immediately after her testimony and
during the rest of the session he assumed
an air of bravado.
In the afternoon Snipper testified In
his own behalf. He admitted having com
mitted arson because Delanay, who had
caused his arrest for stealing harness,
had accused him of being a firebug, and
he thought he would have satisfaction by
setting fire to the accuser's property. He
said he bad exchanged shots with Officer
Allen and had a dim recollection of firing
shots at the Delaney house, but as to
what occurred from that time until the
officers tore off the planks of his father's
bouse to capture him he declared his
mind was blank.
Defendant always hnd a ready answer
for any question, bul a.\ times his replies
materially injured his capo.
Although nothing is feared unless the
case culminates in a verdict for the â â â  -
at, yet all precautions are being
taken to avoid any demonstration, as it
is asserted by those who profess to know
thai Suisser will never leave Salinas un
f< ss sentenced to hang.
During the entire trial thus far no evi
dence has been Introduced to show that
the murder was premeditated. Thi
fi nse has offered proof, however, that he
dead Sheriff and the murderer were on
the besi of terms, while the defendant's
testimony was to the effect that he had
been Intoxicated for several days on ac
count of his arresi as a thief, and bro id-
Ing over such trouble, possibly had caused
the killing of Farley,
When SuiSÃer left the stand thp taking
of evidence closed and argument will be
gin to-morrow morning.
SUBMARINE TORPEDO
BOAT A SUCCESS
GRKENPORT, N. V.. Nov. 6.â The final
official trial of the Holland, the sub
marine torpedo boat, took place this
afternoon In Pecontc Hay before a naval
board of Inspection and survey, consist-
Ing of Rear Admiral Frederick Ro(
mander William H. Emory, Chief
Engineer Charles R. Roelker, Naval Con
structor Washington L. Gapps and Lieu
tenant Richardson Henderson. Before
the Holland left New Suffolk the entire
board went aboard and examined her.
The first run was made shortly after 2
o'clock, With John Lowe and i 'ommander
Emory on board. She made a quick dive
and ran a course of one mile with a fly-
Ing Btart, submerged, covering the d's
tance in nine and one-fourth minutes. 3he
then came to the surface and a White
head torpedo was tired with such ac
curacy as would have sunk a ship in the
position of the target used.
In ten second? the Holland was sub
merged again, turned in a radius of sev
enty feel and returned to the starting
point. Her commander. Emory, returned
to the yacht Josephine, on which wÂ»re
the board of Inspectors, Isaac L. Rice,
president of the Holland Company; In.
ventor John Holland, C. K. Creecy a.nd
Walter H. Barrett.
Lieutenant Henderson and Naval Con-
Btructor Gappp then went on board me
Holland and she started off on a three
quarters submerged run. At the end of
thia run. while ten feet under water, a
torpedo was fired. This also made the
target.
The Holland then pot away quickly
while still submerged and returned to
the start. Her speed trial developed etght
knots. The board appeared much pleased
with the test.

IV. VELASQUEZ.
BY ARTHUR LINCOLN FROTHING
HAM JR.. PH.D.
Tn a review of Spanish painting Velas
quez comes to us as the first really orig
inal genius to represent in his art rh"
spirit of his nation. Before him painting
had possessed too strong a combination
of foreign flavors to be called national.
The French predominance during the tliir
teenth and fourteenth centuries. ,he Flem
ish during the fifteenth and the italian j
during the sixteenth century had bei i
nearly absolute as to give little freedi m
for national expansion In art. Of course j
thÂ» religious enthusiasm, the love nf vjo- i
lent contrasts and of dark coloring, the 1
antipathy to the classic and to the nude, |
not only strongly Influenced Spanish paint
ers in their choice of Flemish and Italian
models, hut gave a decidedly local flavor. j
For all the love of the gorgeous Venetian
school shown by Spain's rulers and mag
nates it was the BcUognese school and its
offshoots which, just before Velasquez,
most appealed to the Spaniards, both on '
account of the florid and enthusiastic
treatment of popular religious tr>emes by ,
the f'arracci, Guido and others, and be- '

cause of its dramatic color effects and its
occasional i aturalism. For the samo rea
son the dark and fantastic Neapolitan
school, with Caravagglo and Ribera, was
a strong factor in guiding Sp*an:sh paint
ers.
Velasquez came at a critical moment in
Spanish art. In other branches of civil
izationâ ihoge naturally the earliest to
develop in any newly founded nationâ
Spain had long before assumed a well
defined character. In religious matters,
in state policy, in administration, Spain,
during the sixteenth century, had worked
from clear-cut and inflexible ideals that
have stamped her in history. Over a
large part of Europe as well as of the
New World she had extended the iron
grasp of these Ideals, and now when her
power was waning she was calling to her
aid the resources of painting to maintain
the hold of religion on the masses. Pa
checo, who was to be Velasquez's teacher
and fathor-in-law, was embodying in a
standard "Guide to Painters" the clerical
idea of the "scope and duty of painting as
an educational medium in the grasp of the
church. But before Murillo was to raise
this "tendency painting" Into the realm
at pure beauty came Velasquez, who made
Murillo possible. By his genius he sot a
seal upon a national style that should
for the first time give Spain in the field
of painting as high a place among na
tions as she had already attained In other
fields. No wo-nder that when 'elasqtiez
came he received a right royal welcome.
Don Diego de Sllva Velasquez was born
at Seville In June, GS9. Though of nob'o
family, his parents allowed him to follow
his leaning for an artist's life, and at 13
he' entered the studio of the famous, fiery
Ilerrera, but soon passed to that of Pa
checo, where he spent five years in paint
ing genre subjects and in careful study
of physiognomy. Pacheco so appreciated
his character and budding talents that he
gave him his daughter, in marriage in
lMv Tiit- young painter was, in his teens,
n pure realist, delighting in tavern and
kitchen scenes and every variety of com
mon life, a 8 we can see from his "Water
Carrier" at ApSley Court and his "Adora
tion of the Shepherds" in the National
Gallery. Even his religious pictures had
then an obtrusive dominant element of
peasantry, which afterward disappeared.
In 1623 an eventful change took place in
the artist's life. Up was called to- Madrid,
and by favor of the Prime Minister Oli
vares becam<\ at the extraordinarily
youthful age of 24, portrait painter to
King Philip IV, the royal family and the
court. VelasQues must have shown great
social tact and ability not only to keep
throughout his life the favor so early ob
tained but steadily to increase it. The
royal palace at Madrid had become a su
perb picture gallery, Where many of the
great masters of the sixteenth century
were magnificently represented, and by a
study of those masterpieces Velasquez
broadened hi^ knowledge, obtained new
insight into the possibilities of color and
acquired flexibility and confidence. He
v. is weaned both from, crass realism and
from the "tendency" school, and turned
to the study of the human personality.
For ten years after his coming to Ma
drid Velasquez appears to have confined
himself to aristocratic portraits, turning
away from his earlier themes of common
lif. as unsuited to the courtly atmosphere
cf Madrid. In 169 tin- Interesting episode
of Rubens' visit to Madrid brought the
Spaniard for the first time into personal
contact with one of his great contempo
raries. It was at Rubtns' suggestion that
Velasquez, with the consent and financial
help of the King and of Olivares. made
the important decision to visit Italy to
study the Italian masters at home. At
Venice he studied and copied Tintoretto
and especially Titian, whom he regarded
as the greatest of all Italians. At Rome,
where he made a far longer stay, he spent
most of his time at the Vatican, studying
and copying Raphael and Michelangelo,
but he also devoted himself to getting ac
quainted with antique sculpture. Strange
as it may appear to us, he certainly also
imbibed a decided liking for that latest
ohase of Italian Daintinjj, the Bolognese
scnool, and especially for Guido. His
Italian Journey here immediate fruit in
his art. showing not only In his technique
hut in his conception and composition of
hiÂ« theme; as in his "Forge of Vutcan"
and tli" "Christ at the Pilli
After ;\n absence of a year and a half
Velasquez returned to Madrid, in 1631, and
again took up the daily routine of court
lift" 1 and associations. The following nine
teen years of his middle period show no
violant changes, hut a gradual advance in
surety of method, breadth of theme and
grasp of human nature. He paints not
only portraits, but Bcenes of court life and
amusements, such as hoar hunts and stag
hunts, a? well as elaborate historical and
religious scenes. The foremost of his large
compositions, the scene of the "Sun
of Breda." the crowning exploit of the ca
reer of that great imperialist general,
Spinoln. is judged by some critics to be
one of the greatest historical painting- 1 . At
about the same time he produced one of
his most, perfect portraits, that of "Ad
miral Pulido Pare.ia." now in the National
Gallery. A chronological study of the
portraits that led up to tnis one is the beat
index t" his artistic progress. To about
this time belongs, in part at least, that
remarkable series of full-length portraits
of the ".Sports" of the royal palace, such
as dwarfs and buffoons, In whose por
trayal Velasquez could assume greater
liberty in attitude and expression and
greater realism than In his sot aristocratic
portraits with their exigencies uf dress
and dignity.
Jn I^-59 the painter took a second journey
t" Italy, ostensibly to buy fur the King
pictures and casts from the antique, buc
we may believe that he was driven to it
by his gain the stimulus of fur
thi-r contact with th.- best Italian art.
There can be no better proof of the mas
ter's tremendous advance since his first
visit, when he painted the rather aca
demic and weak "Forge of Vulcan," than
a Bimple comparison of this picture with
the masterpiece of his second visit, th<Â»
portrait of "Pope Innocent X," now in thÂ«
Doria-Pamftl) gallery, one of the i
wonderful of portraits and sufficient in'it
sell to immortalize its author. That this
was not a "fluke" is shown by the almost
equally living and forceful portrait of hia
Morisco attendant and pupil, Pareja,
whirl: he also did in Rome as a prelimin
ary to the papal portrait.
The last ten years of the painter's life,
after his return to Madrid, must have
held a strange admixture of gratifica
tion and of disappointment, for he at
tained to more public honors than he
could have had a right to expect, and yet
for i his very reason his artist's soul
hindered in lta expansion by the inces
sant public calls upon him. At his own
request he was appointed in 1Â»>52 palace
marshal to the King, in addition to his
other office of director uf the royal gal
leries. His new duties included the or
ganization and direction of all court fetes
and pomrts and of royal journeys, the de
signing and decorating of the royal pa!
,nii oven the supervision of the de
tails of court life, such as the heating and
lighting of the household. Certainly all
this labor was not wasted, for it gavo
Velasquez the opportunity to do for Spain
what Holbein had done for England in
the time of Henry Vlllâ the opportunity
to direct tho public taste in all branches
Of art and art industry in a way far tran
scending in popular effect the influence of,
his own artistic work.
Velasquez could not have found during
these years the lone; spells for con
tinuous" work that his earlier life had al
lowed. Perhaps this partly accounts for
the freer and more sketchy character uf
his late works, the most effective and
Impressionistic of all and those in which
he has come into possession "f a far
wii'.cr range of color effects. Aside from
his portraits, many of the finest of which
belong here, we should Judge of . th*s.
period of his life not by such lifeless pro
ductions as tho classic subjects r. -quired
by the taste of the time, to which his
realistic genius was unsuited, but by his
famous interiors, the "Maids of Honor"
and "The Tapestry Workers," and prob
ably by some of the group of serio-comio
portraits of the court Jesters and dwarfs.
In the prime of his artistic strength and
high in royal favor. Velasquez was struct
down in his sixty-second year, by an
acute illness hrqught on by his labors as
court marshal. In that capacity it be
came his duty to superintend the arrange
ments for a royal journey to the Spanish
frontier. The French and Spanish courts,
after a prolonged struggle, had become
reconciled, and the reconciliation was to
be consecrated by the marriage of the
Tnfanta Maria Teresa to King Louis XIV.
The fatigue and responsibility Involved
in managing so gigantic an undertaking
so sapped the master's strength that he
could not resist the ensuing ague, but
died on August Â«. 1860, to the genuine grief
of King Philip IV and the court.

NEW TORK, Nov. ThÂ« course of the
et-ck market to-day effectually dtss!pated the
symptoms of weakness which v.ere engendered
b> the Saturday bank statement. The coursa
ot prices was downward in the early dealings,
but practically ail the declines were recovered
and some striking net gains were established
In considerable of the list of stocks. The
downward course proceeded to the extent of .
1 to 2 points in a number of the prominent In- i
dustrials and reached as much as a point
In a number of ratlr.>ad3. Including examples :
from the grangers,- Southwestern*, Southerns,
coalers and trunk lines. Northwestern dropped
at one time 2*. In the leading Industrials a
level of priced was subsequently established,
reaching generally a point above .Saturday.
The railroad group was not so resilient, but
its downward course of the morning was very
generally retracted and fractional net gains !
are the rule. In Southern Pacific the recent '
large and organized buying was resumed after I
the decline had reached and it was advanced
1% and closed there. The speculation in
leather continued on an enormous scale, the
price being raised on running Bales of 20,000
shares at the opening from N, .â â â '. m to â Â»
aNjve Saturday's price. Subsequently the loss
of Saturday was more than recovered and the
price lilted to within a shade of 41. Thera
was heavy realizing In the stock in the late
d'-;;lini's, but it was firmly supported at 40.
The renewed support by the ppeculative pool i
in leather had no small influence in dissi
pating the fears of a more general break in i
prices. There were many soothing explana- '
tions offered of the exhibit of a deficit In i
Burplua reserves by Saturday's bank statement, j
The favorable explanation among speculators '
was that it was due to an "error" In the re- j
turn of a single bank, or rather to the rectlfl- j
cation of an error mad? in â¢ ie previous week's |
return. It was this error, so It wan said, ;
which had caused ihe unduly favorable state
ment of October 28, and the allowance for It !
â¢was what made the showing of the deficit I
of la.n Saturday an 3 upset the stock market. !
â¢ The comfort found in this explanation was I
somewhat disturbed by the rl.Â«e In the call
money rate tr> 12 per cent and the 'calling of
Joans by the banks. But the conviction becam?
general that Saturday's bank statement wan
.. not a fair Index of the actual condition of
the banks. The continued hardness of New j
York exchang? at Important interior points â 
aroused expectations that the movement of
money Is about to -urn In favor of New York.
The short contracts which were put out in
the mornir.s: were very â  rally covered be
. fore the close. The eve of the elections was
also the occasion for covering of some short
contract* which had r*en put out, on the
â  theory that this year's election might be the
prelude to the unsettled business conditions
which are looked for in a presidential year.
The drop in the money rate to 5 per cent late
In the day accentuated the buying demand
for stocks. -m; incident of the" day was a

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, Nov. 6 âThe opening: in wheat,
though quiet, was not without Interest, and
considerable strength was shown. For the first
tima in> weeks prospective buyers had some
thing really substantial to encourage them in
strong and higher cables and world's ship
ments that were much smaller than had been
looked for. with prospects of a continuance
of small shipments. Uneasiness by local shorts
shown on Saturday's curb was much more ap
parent at the opening to-day, and buying from
that class of traders had much to do with
the advance in prices that took plaoe. The
demand was not heavy, but offerings were fe-.r
and far between, and shorts in consequence
had seme difficulty at times in covering. There
was some selling by professionals on the first
announcement of Western receipts, which
turned out to be heavier by nearly 300 cars
than the actual receiptn and later some selling
was also done on the announcement of an In
crease of 1,440,000 in the visible supply. But
all <.n>rings were quickly abe ed, and at
no time did the market exhibit weakness. The
trend of prices was steadily upward, and dur
irg the last hour of the session, the best
prices of the day were obtaining. December
opened *ifi ..â  higher at es^flSS^c. After a
slight further rally it eased of! to 6SÂ»ic. then

Provisions were slow, hut In the main steady.
Heavy receipts of hogs acted .1.- a drag to the

Futures sympathized with a slight advance at
Chicago, and Improved somewhat. Spot quota
tions were unchanged.
Chicago opened firm under an advance of Vid
at Liverpool. The world's shipments' for the
week were 5,600.000 bushels, about half of last
year. Shipments on passage decreased 2.000.000
bushels. Acalnst these bullish statements,
however, was an increase of 1,440,000 bushels in
the visible supply. The Northwest reported
farmers selling freely and that receipts would
be even larger were cars more plentiful. The
strength in Corn helped Wheat.

LABORING MEN SUFFERERS
AN ABLE DISCUSSION OF THE
MOOTED QUESTION.
Â«
He Enumerates a Number of Evils of
the Industrial System â Who
Should Qvra. Public
Utilities?
Rev. Dr. E. R. Dllle of Oakland de
livered a scorching arraignment on trusts
yesterday morning before- the Methodist
Episcopal Ministers' Union. His strong
Views on the labor question '. : cited great
applause and he was afterward congrat
ulated for his able exposition â â ( the sub
ject; The title of the paper he read was
"A Study of the Labor Question," and
in part he said!
The labor problem Is but another na:ne
for the problem of humanity. The destiny
of labor is the desiln\ oi the race, for the
grem muss or men imi?t end in a sociÂ«.l
order of workingiii^n. The workl:Â»?nuui has
a right to a rair share of the realth his
labor produces. There Is no Intelligent, falr
mlr.ded man who believes that naked
muscle should be paid the eamc wap?e as
muscle plus brains and training; that
skilled labor should be reduced to the level
of unskilled labor; that the railroad super
intendent or president should receive the
same wases as the brakeman. Bui when a
p;ar. toll* twelve to Blxteen hours a day
tor a. paltry $1 or s': and sees another man
raid four millions a year out of the wealth
he helped to produce, he think? there is
gross Injustice somewhere and I agree With
him.
A great factory owned by a syndicate of
nitllictiniros paid a monthly 5 rev cent divi
dend lost year and yet the men whoss
work made the dividend possible only re
ceived $1 for a ten-hour day* work. vVhat
cops It mean to the man who only gets
{1 for a day's work? It means servitude
and slavery In all but name, and a. wretohec
life fcr the children he brings into the
world.
Th<Â» evil Df. trusts la that they make pos
sible Â»v.oh combinations of capital that a
comparatively fey rich nv-n can control the
commerce anO the industries of the world.
Becoadly, they present inducements for the
ufÂ« of unlawful means to attain the ends
proposed. Thirdly, having secured by these
nvans the control of an article or article*
Of commerce they use their power to raie*
prices and practice extortion upon the pub
lic. The modern trust is a great octopus
that padlocks factories and places ten thou
sand wa.ce-earners on tlie list of loafers,
beegars and tramps.
We are the richest nation on earth and
a? cur wealth Incr-visc-a wo are 1 kÂ»ly % >
b-jr more and more Rigantlc n^Kr^ations o f
capital until civilized people shall say to
tha rising tido of monopoly, "Thus far
shalt thcu corr.e but no farther."
The meat â¢ newspapers are beginning to
make Themselves heard upon this imminent
peril. CciisrÂ«sÃ has ;t weapon within reach
with whk-h to give the dÂ».ith stroke to all
of the rapacljus trusts now existing. Most
of these combinations deal in American pro
ducts cf which tbey have a monopoly. It
!s * press perversion of the taxing power
of the Government to impose a tariff with
out yi"ldlr.ar a revenue to the Government
as It enable* trusts to plunder American
citizens. Another evil to our industrial sys
tem is the employment of women In the
Industrial world. Work is now done by
women for SO cents and fO cents a day for
which men have in tim^s *-â  received $2
per day.
I u:n not :iiestl"nlrsf the ri^ht of laborers
to strike; they have the Fame rlg-ht to or
panlz- a lnlÂ«-.r tnist that capitalist. : have to
organize other tr*iKtÂ°, but I am Qtiesflon
' In? Its expediency; I an: a firm believer in
c modified socialism. I believe d the na
tiorali7atlur. or munl^ipalirat'.on of all
monopolies, such as wharves, brldre?, fer
rle*. waterways, railways, telegraphs, tele
phor.es. electric light plants, water work?,
pas workF, street cars, etc.. but I am not
propnrc-d to go the lÂ«>nf?U; of Karl Marx.
Oronlund and Bellamy and apply collect
ivism everywhere. In my opinion extreme
socialism Involve? such suppression of In
dirldual liberty as to be fatal to It.

GASOLINE LAUNCH DESTROYED.
Carelessness in Handling a Lamp
Causes an Explosion.
MARYSVILLE, Nov. G.-On Sunday
evening a gasoline launch which piled
between Sacramento and Vernon In the
freight and paspenger trade, and which

Cronin's Hard Fight
to Avoid Arrest.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Nov. 6.
The police made four arrests yesterday
of suspected highwaymen and burglars.
This afternoon three of them were .urned
loose and the fourth is a very interesting
prisoner.
Frank Cronin of West Oakland was ar
rested last evening, but not before he had
made a desperate effort to prevent the
otflce*s from taking him. During the Rat
tle several shots were fired and one of
them passed through the fleshy part of
Cronin a left arm.
Sergeant McKinley and Officers Murray
and Stahl were charged with the task of
arresting Cronin. The warrant which they
took was sworn out two weeks ago by
Jos* Pragra. charging Cronin with disturb
ing the peace. It was known that Cro
nin was likely to give trouble when
threatened with arrest and the warrant
was used bo that he would not suspect
that they wanted him on a more serious
charge. As soon as Cronin saw the war
rant he seemed to realize what the officers
were after, for ho attempted to escape
by jumping through a window and on the
roof of' a neighboring house. During- the
chase several shots were fired and Cro
nin was hit. After receiving the wound
he surrendered to the police on the top
of the house at 721 Henry street.
Sergeant McKinley says that after '.he
man had Jumped through the window four
shots were fired for the purpose of scar
ing him. That they were not fired very
wide of the mark Is proof that the offi
cers did not Intend that he should have
too (pood a chance to escape. The charge
of disturbing the peace would not have
Justified the officers In shooting, but
he was suspected of being a party to the
recent robberies In this city and Alameda
and his extraordinary efforts to escape
apparently justified the officers in using
their guns.
This afternoon Chief Hodg-kins examined
into the doings of the suspects for the
last week ann released three ot them,
named J. Lynch, A. Webber and J. James.
Cronin will be kept pending further in

OAKLAND
CANDIDATES IN
PLENTY FOR JOB
OF ALEXANDER
Friend May Retain
Arthur Martin.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Nov. 6.
The recent tragic incident in the post
| office has brought on very suddenly an
; unexpected political wire-pulling match.
j There must be appointed soon an assist
ant postmaster, and the appointment lies
primarily with Postmaster Friend.
There is no dearth of candidates, and
| the postmaster la already discovering:
! that he has aa large a task on his hands
i as he had a year ago when he made his
! first appointment. It was understood
i when Mr. Alexander was appointed that
â¢ he was not Mr. Friend's choice, at lea-st
; that he was not Mr. Friend's first choice.
i There were many elements In the Repub
j Mean party, however, each clamoring for
the privilege of filling the office of asslst-
I ant postmaster, and as Alexander had the
indorsement of Senator Perkins and Con
gressman Hilborn. and as these two gen
tleman also had the privilege of saving
I whether or not Mr. Friend should be
! postmaster, it was very natural that Mr.
; Friend Bhould be pleased to appoint Mr.
Alexander.
At present Arthur Martin, who was as
sistant under ex-Postmaster White, Is
back at his old desk, and the Democrats
; are making great efforts to induce Post
master Friend to appoint Mr. Martin per
i manently on account of his knowledge of
the office work and his known attention
i to business.
L. T. Farr, who was assistant postmaf
ter under ex-Postmaster Bishop, and who
; was a candidate for the same position
! under Mr. Friend, is again mentioned for
hip old job. He is the candidate of the
! old Republican element, and now that
j Congressman Metcalf has succeeded Mr.
! Hilborn and he will likely have some
i thing to say In the matter, there is a
! chance for Mr. Farr. The opposition to
i Farr would also come from Paul Schaffer,
I who Ih also supposed to be a candidate for
; assistant postmaster.
Paul Bcbaffer was the secretary of Mr.
I Metcalf'a campaign committee, and could,
if he wished, go to Washington in a few
weeks as private secretary to Congress
man Metcalf. This situation, however,
would hardly be as remunerative as the
one In the postoffice, and Schaffer may
also be cons'.dered as a possible successor
to Alexander.
Ju.st on what authority is not known,
but frequent mention is now being made
of the name of W. Nat Friend for as
sistant postmaster. It was understood
that W. N.it Friend, the son of the post
i master, would not have objected to the
i job when his father was appointed, but
objections were raised which prevailed.
Should "Billy" Friend be a candidate he
i could certainly depend on the support of
Dr. George Pardee, for "Billy" has al
ways been a very earnest and active ad-
I vocate of the doctor's political aspira
tions, and was of necessity the most con
. spicuous figure In the Pardee camp at
i Sacramento. "Will Friend is very pop
-1 ular in the Young Men's Republican Club.
| is one of the idols of the Pondinkeye.
: but was us firm an opponent of the can-
I didacy of Congressman Metcalf as he was
; the warm advocate of Mr. Hilborn. All
j these things must be considered ns ele
; merits in the task of filling the position,
which, it is understood, pays $150 a month.
Postmaster Friend said to-night that
there are half a dozen applicants for the
position, but he could not make up his
mind till Wednesday.
"I am giving the matter my attention,"
said the postmaster, "and 1 have about
i made un my mind that a new man will
i not do.
This remark seems to indicate that he
intends to retain Arthur Martin, and it is
rumored that the postal inspectors have
! dropped a hint that this would be a wise
move.

A Free Trial Treatment Sent Privately by Mai! to All Who
Suffer.
A Remarkable Remedy for a Terrible Affliction â The Cure Is
. Permanent,
A free trial treatment Is belns Â»er.t out by
; the State Medlca'. Institute In order to demon -
j strate the fact that the most horrible of all
' diseases <?Â»n be cured. There Is a good deal
j of controversy over thlÂ» subject among those
' who declare the disease incurable, but the fact?
are Indubitable a.r.d must be acknowledged. The
action of tills new remedy 1c peculiar. The
physician In charge of the institute has had a
long and varied experience treating this dis-
ease of the blood, and about two years ago,
after a long series of experiments, he found the
exact specific that offsets the poison, rendÂ»rvi
It lifeless and eliminates It from the body.
Having personally examined many hundreds of
i r.aaes and famlllarizpd himself with every detail
of the disease his discovery came naturally and
has never failed him. One of his recent cures was
a moÂ«t hopeless case, the disease having caused
the hair to fall out, and the body was one mass
of putrescent gores, bolls, blotches and un-
Flchtly dlsflp-nrcTnents. In a few days the en-

PRETTY SINGER
GETS JUDGMENT
OVER A NOTE
Suit of the Keesings
Finally Decided.
Oakland Office San Francesco Call.
90S Broadway, Nov. 6.
Mr-Â«. A. B. Keesing, a San Francisco
songstress, who during the trial of the
suit In which she and her husband are
defendants exhibited such versatility in
court that Judge and spectators were
kept in almost constant laughter re
cently, has won a victory over her plain
tiff mother-in-law, Mrs. Hannah Keesing.
The suit, filed several months ago. was
brought by the elder Mrs. Keesing to
have nullified a promissory note for $4000
which she had given to her son, Albert
li. Keesing. in lieu of any inheritance he
might expect from her estate. Young
Mr. Keesing had in the meantime been
married, divorced and remarried his pres
ent wife. It developed at the trial that
he had followed his wife from here to
New York, thence to Europe and back
ngaln, and thereafter he had transferred
the note to his wife, who, the mother-in
law alleged, had later tried to dispose of
the instrument in San Francisco. The
elder Mrs. Keesing' s hopes to frustrate
the latter scheme prompted the suit, and
to-day Judge Ellsworth handed down a
decision giving judgment to defendants,
whereby the Handsome blonde singer at
the Olympia Theater in San Francisco
becomes the indisputable owner of the
$4000 note.
A stay of execution for twenty days was
granted, but the order enjoining the sale
of the note is dissolved.

On that sweet, heavenly shore.

AUTONOMY IN
NEGROS ISLAND
New Government Is Now
Established.
RESULT OF THE ELECTIONS
OATH OF OFFICE ADMINIS
TERED TO OFFICIALS.
Special Dispatch to The CalL.
MANILA, Nov. 6.â At Bacolor, In the
island of Negros, the autonomous Govern
ment of :he Filipinos was established to
day. General Smith, Governor of the
island of Negros, administered the oath
of office to the Judge of the Supreme
Court, who in turn swore In the Gover
nor, three Judges, twelve Councilmen, the
Auditor and the Secretary of the Interior.
The natives of the entire island attended
the ceremony. The officers from Iloilo
were also present. Three days' feasting
will follow the celebration of the new
Government and the first anniversary of
the surrender of the Spanish to the Ne
gros revolutionists, ending with a ball in
the Government house to-night.
American flags are displayed in the vil
lage. The celebration consisted of horse
racing and other sports, music, religious
functions and illumination. The ball to- j
night attracted the wives of the wealthy
planters and there was a great display
of rich costumes and costly jewels, sucn
as would be Been at a similar affair in
America or Europe.
Elections were held October 2, the num
ber of votes cast being 5248. There were
forty candidates for the various offices.
Melectio Revlernlo was elected Governor,
receiving i3us votes. Senor Galme received
1277 votes. Suffrage was determined by
property qualification and ability to read j
and write.
Colonel Miner welcomed the officials on I
behalf of the United States. In the
course of his remarks he said:
"Negros ;eads in the van of civil gov
ernment in the Philippines. Your honor
lies In adding a new star to freedom's
flag."
General Smith, during a speech which
he delivered, said:
"Your future promises as brightly as
i Japan's, which to-day is recognized as
i among the civilized nations of the world."
; Senor Severino, in replying, said that 'he
i best thing for the future of Negros was
the continuance of close relations with
the United States. General Smith then
announced the granting of freedom to the
j political prisoners in commemoration of
the event. General Hughes, in con mand
at Iloilo, tendered a congratulatory speech
over the eastern cable fi'om that place.
| General Smith in an interview lemarked
I that it was of the utmost importance that
i th.> Filipinos should be taught to recog
: nize the rovereignty of the United states.
i "The gravest danger," he added, "threat
! ening a peaceful administration is in
| trigue among the insular politicians," and
' he declared that the United States Gov- j
ernment must for years keep control of
the Philippines In order to prevent such
conditions "from existing.
The members of the Sixth Infantry,
I which is divided into three garrisons
' throughout the island of Negr n s, are vn _
! dergoing great hardships. A recently or
; ganlzed revolutionary movement has been
' discovered in Northern Negros and the
leaders have been forced to withdraw to
Panay. A number of bandits under the
leadership of Papa Isio, a religious char-
I latan. have been driven to the mountains,
but it is expected they will give more
trouble. A force of 230 native soldiers,
: armed with Springfield rifles, are helping
; the Americans and are found to be valu
able as scouts.
General Lawton's operations have been
temporarily suspended owing to heavy
rains. The country around Cabantuan is
flooded. The river, however, has begun
fulling rapidly and probably the country
in that reel ion will soon resume its nor
mal condition.

and in platoon form met the steamship
Queen five miles down the sound. As the
Queen came up. the vessels formed In
four columns, allowing her to pass be
tween the second and third. The Queen
blew one short and two long blasts, the
signal for the grand ovation. The volun
teers crowded the forward decks and an
swered the wildly enthusiastic greeting.
Into the harbor they came, and then the
Government cutters Grant, Corwin and
Perry turned loose with their guns. The
Washington and Oregon batteries boomed
from the shore. Aerial shells were sent
up. It seemed as if the city would be
shaken to pieces. The sound was deaf
ening, and the numerous bands could not
be heard fifty feet away. After the in
formal reception at the dock and thirty
minutes for reunion, the big land parade
took place. General Nelson A. Miles and
Governor Rogers were the distinguished
guests.

HAWAII ASKED 10
MAKE REPARATION
Foreign Claims Must Be
Adjusted.
ATTITUDE OF UNCLE SAM
WANTS THE ISLANDS TO
SETTLE THE CASES.
BY HORACE WRIGHT.
Special Correspondence to The Call.
HONOLULU. Oct. 31.â 1 have had a
conversation with President Dole and hiÃ
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Mott-
Smith. in reference to the claims of Brit
ish residents against the Hawaiian Gov
ernment for alleged Illegal imprisonment
during the revolution of 1595.
Mr. Dole deemed it Improper Inad
visable to permit the publication of the
letter of Attorney General Griggs in ref
erence to them, as he did not consider
the correspondence closed, but in order to
correct any erroneous impressions he
made the following statement:
The letter in question does not recognize
either the validity or invalidity of these
claims nor does It suggest, according to
Mr. Dole's interpretation of it, any course
of action for his Government to pursue.
It is merely, as he sayÃ, a return of the
papers ''for consideration and settle
ment," without the slightest expreasioa
to guide him as to the wishes of the
Washington executive. He explained that
"settlement" in this connection did not
necessarily imply "payment," for Hawaii
might decline to pay and maintain Its
former contention that it had acted with
in its rights In Imprisoning the uspects
and had incurred no liability to any for
eign Government. The island government
might, on the other hand, decide to re
open the question locally, take evidence
and deal with each case on its merits, or,
again, it might reconsider the matter on
the basis of the negotiations enducted
by the late British commissioner, Hawes,
some time prior to annexation. This plan
wa*j practically an offer by the deceased
commissioner to accept about $30,000, if
paid at once, for the seven or eight Brit
ish sublets who were imprisoned, and
was made to avoid embarrassment to the
local Government during its efforts to
procure annexation. The lamented demise
of the commissioner delayed the negotia
tions until on the eve of annexation the
matter was by consent transferred to
United States Minister Sewall for refer
ence to Washington.
The action that has taken place in
Washington between the Secretary of
State and the Ministers of foreign pow
ers interested forms no part of this end
of the story. In addition to Great Britain
and the United States (for there are
American claimants) the countries prin
cipally interested are Portugal, Denmark
and Greece, and the impression exists
that an opportunity will be accorded to
Mr. Dole to move this affair out of the
road before the executive consent is given
to any bill providing for Hawaii's future
government.
It is too late in the day to speak of the
humiliations and indignities thrust upon
those menâ respectable men and men of
family 3ome of themâ after their arrest
on mere suspicion and on the oaths of
ex-convicts who were proved perjurers
and personal enemies. Their cautious
governments have indorsed their claims
and further temporizing on the part of
Mr. Dole will only lead to more unfriend
ly feelings.
DETAILS OF PLAN
TO CUT OFF AGUINALDO
BT CARRIER PIGEON FROM THE
TRANSPORT SHERIDAN, AT SEA,
VIA MANILA, Nov. 6.â General Wheat
on's expedition will land in the Gulf of
lylnpayen to cut oft the retreat of the
rebels on the roads as far north a* Ro
sario and to hold the road to the south
east to San Jaclnto. It is thought this
will interfere with Aguinaldo's natural
line of retreat to the north, as all other
mountain passes are not available for
heavy transportation.

HARD TIMES OFF CAPE HORN
MAXY SHIPS PUT tNTO PORT
STANLEY IN DISTRESS.
fconie Vessels of the Coast Fleet Over
due â Barbound Schooners Get
Out of Grays Harbor
in a Bunch.
The steamer Doric arrived from the
Orient a day ahead of time yesterday.
She made the run from Hongkong In 27
days 10 hours, via Yokohama 16 days 12
hours and Honolulu 5 days hours. She
brought up li cabin and 15 second cabin
passengers and 319 Chinese, besides the
most valuable consignment of Bilk ever
brought to this port. She carries 2346
bales of the raw material, valued . at
$2,500,000. From Yokohama she carried to
Honolulu GoO Japanese, who will be dis
tributed among the various plantations.
When tuo Doric was a day out from
Yokohama she passed the transport St.
Paul, bound In. The St. Paul should
therefore reach San Francisco this week.
The transport Indiana, with the Tennes
see troops aboard, was left at Nagasaki.
She was to leave for Ban Francisco on
October 2-i, and will probably not reach
bexe before Monday or Tuesday next.
Among those who came up on the Doric
â were lxÂ»Â»-d JBalcarrea, who has been trav
eling tnruusU KusÂ»ia and Siberia with
Trunibo White of Chicago: Airs. F. A.
Beatty, wife of Lieutenant Beatty of the
Monterey; Lieutenant Colonel A. B. Bay
keÂ» of ;be Tennesjsee regiment: Captain
\WH. Anderson, U. B. A.; Major C. W.
McCawley, Lulled States marine corps,
and Mrs. W. H. A very, wife of the Pacinc
Mail Company's agent at Yokohama.
Vessels from Europe and Eastern ports
for Pacidc Coast ports are having a card
lima of It rounding the Horn. Cable dis
patches from Lonudon to the Merchants'
Exchange state that the British ship
Blackbraes, from Newcastle, England, tor
6an Francisco, and the British bark
Beechbank, from Hamburg for Santa Ko
palia, had put Into Port Stanley, Falkland
Islands, with the loss of sails and decks
damaged, and In the case of the Boech
bank the crew sick. The French bark
Emlle Galllne, from Swansea for San
Francisco, had to put back to Kio de Jan
eiro, ajid the French bark Marechal Vil
llers, from St. Nazalre, France, for Port
land, had to put back to Montevideo, both
Vessels partly dismasted.
Shipping men cannot understand what
â¢was the matter with the American ship
A. G. Ropes. The general impression was
that she was well on her way here and
would arrive the latter part or' the month.
Instead of that a cable to the Exchange
yesterday says that she sailed from Port
Stanley on October 30. ShÂ« Is now 101
days out from New York, and the chances
are now that it will be January before she
reaches port. There is no telling how
geriously she was damaged, as the tele
pram simply announces her sailing.
The American ship Cyrus Wakelield Is
row out 121 days from Port Stanley.
where she put In for repairs, and 2u per
cent reinsurance is being paid on her.
The general impression ia that she has
followed the Charles E. Moody around the
Cape of Good Hope and will arrive here
in due course.
The bark Ferris S. Thompson and the
Fchooner American Girl left here on Oc
tober ii for Puget Sound. Nothing has
been heard of them since and the owners
are beginning to feel uneasy. The pre-
Vfiiling winds have been very strong from
the southeast and the chances are that
the vessels have been driven past the
Straits of Juan de Fuca and have been
unable to beat back.
There are me fears for the Chilean 1
Imrk Llbertad, now out seventy-five days
from Pinagua for this port with a cargo
of nitrate. She is nn old vessel; built in
IS7I, find was formerly the Persian bark
Prince Hassan. The Libertad is not.
properly speaking:, overdue, but she is an
old vessel and the owners of the cargo |
are anxious.

â¢
Habitue of Thalia Concert Hall Killed
by French Cook Just Back
From the Klon
dike.
Paul do Ranprf>, a French cook, living at
1010 Mission street, murdered a woman
known us Delia O'Connor, a habitue of the
Thalia Beer Hall, in a lodging-house at
14 Turk street, about 1 o'clock this morn
ing.
The crime remained undiscovered for
nearly an hour, during which time De
Bauge remained In the room with his
victim and defied the efforts of the oc
cupants of the house to take him a pris
oner. He was finally taken by the
police and lodged in the tanks
;at the Central police station, where he
! was charged with murder. The murderer
nearly severed the woman's head from
her body with a long dirk. According to
people who occupied rooms close to the
scene De Bauge took the woman's life
because he believed she had robbed him
of $10.
The landlord of the house, William An
i derson, says that the O'Connor, woman
j has paid rent for the room nearly six
I months. He says that about 11 o'clock
! to-night De Bauge entered the room with
r the woman, and about two hours later
; the murder happened. John O'Connor,
who lives with the woman, came to the
door shortly after the crime was com
mitted. He found the room dark and
knocked for admittance. The murderer
I answered O'Connor and told him that he
' had killed the woman.
O'Connor on being refused admission to
the room called the police, who battered
down the door. A terrible sight pre
sented Itself. The woman who had evi
dently been struck while on the bed, was
lying on the floor weltering In blood. A
rope around her neck told that her mur
derer had tried to strangle her before he
used his knife.
The murderer made no resistance after
the police entered the room, and was
taken to the Central station, while the
body of the unfortunate woman was
taken to the Morgue.
De Bauge made the following statement
at the prison:
"I am three weeks from the Klondike.
I met the woman and went to her room.
While my coat was on the lounge she
reached for it and took $10 out of the
pocket. I remonstrated with her to no

SARDINES AND SPRATS.
When the Latter Are Sold as the
Former They Must Pay the
Full Duty.
I'nited States Circuit Judge Marrow
â¢'lay handed down an opinion deny
ing; the application of Wieland Brothers of
San Francisco for a rehearing In tne
matter of an importation "of sprats in oil
being appraised as sardines in oil.
On June 14, IS9S, Wieland Brothers im
ported from Bordeaux. France, to San
Franotsco a lot of sprats in oil packed
in sardine boxes. Customs Collector
Jackson classified them as sardines, 'ihe
Importers protested and contended that
they should be classified as "fish in cars
in a otherwise enumerated and provided
for." The latter classification wnuld save
$1750 to the importers. The classification
of tht; Collector was sustained by the
Board of General Appraisers at New York
and the importers appealed to the Circuit
Court.
Testimony of grocers was to the effect
that the sprats were sold as sarulnea at
a lesser price than sardines prcper, ana
that they bought them as sardines. The
boxes- were also labeled "Sardines a'huile"
(sardines in oil).
The court delved Into the lchthyological
department of natural history and denned
"sprats" as the young of the herring.
Sprats and sardines -belong to the same
familyâ tint of the Clupeidae â and sprats
are sold as sardines of inferior quality.
Sardines being 'the commercial term un
der which they were sold, the fourt de
cided that they must pay duty as sar
dines.

Two volunteer organizations wont Into

was the troop of Nevada cavalry, just ar

In the Philippines-; the other was the For- j

yesterday morning from Fort Niagara,
New York, where it has been recruited.
The men of the Nevada cavalry reached ;
the Presidio alter eating breakfast at the
Palace as the guests of Hon. Frank G. k

Dennis Geary were also guests. Thje tables
were laid In the conservatory of the hotel,
and after the hungry cavalrymen had tin
ished their raid upon the menu there were
speeches by the Governor, by Mr New

the troop, and by others ol the guests.
The record ot the command was refi
to in the highest terms, and the men were
congratulated on the manner In which
they had added to the fame of their Slat.'.
Horses for the troopers had been pro
vided by the Presidio, and after tho
breakfast the men mounted and were es
corted to the camp at the post, which will
be their home until they shall be mus
out before the end of this month. Captain
L-instott hopes tne date will not be later
than November ii>, tut a may take longer
than that to get the troop away. The pa

shape, and there will be no delay caused
by the officers and troop clerks.

East Indian Crew of Transport
Pathan Go on Strike.
Twenty-one East Indians employed as
oilers, coalpassers and firemen on the
British ship Pathan, recently chartered
by the United States to carry troops to
the Philippines, were put in irons yester,
day morning by order of Captain Butler
because they objected to going to .Manila.
The Kast Indians Bhlpped at Singapore
in September for an eighteen months'
voyage and arrived in San Francisco via
Australia about two weeks ago. They
are, according to their own statements, a
cowardly set and when they learned that
the steamer was going to Manila they
Immediately went to the captain and
asked for their discharge. Captain But
ler declined to accommodate them and
they refused to work, whereupon they
were locked up and put on a bread and
water diet until they should think better
of the case.
In the afternoon the captain brought
three of the men ashore and took them
before the British Consul. The latter ad
vised them to return to duty, but their
fear of Filipino bullets was greater than
their drend of immediate punishment, and
as soon as they got outside the consulate
they took leg bail. The other eighteen are
still in irons, and the deserters have em
ployed counsel to secure their release.
The deckhands on the Pathan are all
Malays and have no fear of the Filipinos,
but every reference to the pugnacious
islanders send? shivors chasing up and
down the spinal columns of the East In
dians. They admit that this fear is the
sole cause of their refusal to remain with
the steamer for the full time specified in
the agreement signed by them when they
joined the vessel.
Captain Butler is In the same position
sub the masters of the Pacific Mall steam
ers were when the Chinese crews refused
to go to Manila. The coolies could not be
discharged here, as their contract called
for a discharge in Hongkong. On the City
of Peking Captain Smith decided to take
the strikers to China in irons and there
discharge them. The Chinese gave in

GREAT TRADE
WITH SIBERIA
IS POSSIBLE
W. M. Bunker's Views
of the Future.
Shortly after William M. Bunker sold
out the Report he was matte a special
commissioner of the local chamber of
lerce to visit Siberia and look into
commercial and Industrial conditions of
that country. His first report has been
received here, dated at Paris. Mr. Bunker
that he has traveled to the prin
parta of Siberia, especially those
ms through which the great trans-
Siberian railway Is being built. Remark
able progress has been made on this Line,
which is being built without the aid of
machinery^ but there are still long gaps
in the road where the engineers have seri
ous difficulties to overcome.
Mr Bunker paid special attention to the
Imported products of Siberia and found
that there is a splendid market at all of
the large cities fur California flour, dried
and canned goods ami merchandise o! ail
kinds. Siberians prefer the products of
America to those of Europe, which as a
rule are inferior. In conclusion Mr.
Bunker writes:
After traversing the Russian eriplre from end
to md a distance of 660 miles, and carefully
studying conditions anil prospects, 1 am satis
flnd that unless a tariff shuts out its products
California will pain enormously through the de
velopment of Siberia by the railway. I am
also satisfied that Siberia, undeniably rich in
natural resources, cannot, for many years at
least compete In any way. shape or form with
... Russian-Asiatic trade of San Francisco.
â  stern Siberia wheat Is an inferior article and
the climatic conditions ma..' its Improvement
Impossible. In view of the annual famines in
the empire the probabilities of export would
seem slender Russia contains 8,800,000 square
miles of which one-quarter is in Europe and
the rest In Asia, and thus .ar crop failures in
certain districts have drawn heavily on the vis
it.c supply of wheat in others. The upbuilding
of stern Siberia suggests the rapid develop
ment of the American frontier and I cannot see
why its growth should not continue to help San
Francisco Interests A line of steamers between
San Francisco and Vladivostok would Insure
the market against all comers, and in view or
the Russian-Asiatic trade outlook such a line
should be established.

Jose tor refusing to pay the theater tax
Of $7 in San Jose recently.
Mr Flannery testified that he had called
upon the actor In San Jose and requested
the payment of his theatrical license and
that Mr. Rankin had treated him with
contumely and scorn. Mr. Rankin made
a statement to the effect that he had
been laboring under a misunderstanding
and was willing to pay the tax. but this
was not agreed to by the prosecution and
the actor was held to answer, with bonds
fixed at $500. The penalty in case of con
viction runs up to a fine nf $500 and six
months' imprisonment. Crittenden Thorn
