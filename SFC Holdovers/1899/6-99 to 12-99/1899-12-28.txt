cance of the English-German-
Porti: se Secret Treaty.
BERLIN, Dec. 27. â The Lokal Anzeiger to-night pub
lishes the contents of the German-English-Portuguese secret
treaty. This double, treaty will have executive force as soon as
the Swiss jurists, Messrs. Blaesi, Hensler and Goldau, have
given a decision in the Detagoa arbitration. The decision, it is
expected, will be given in January or February, and will prob
ably be in favor of England, in which case Portugal must pay
to England and America an indemnity of 1,900.000 pounds
sterling. England obtained in IS9I from Portugal the right of
pre-emption in Delngoa Bay. The cession of Delagoa Bay to
England may therefore be expected in March next.
It is possible that President Kruger may now declare war
on Portugal and attack Dclagoa at once.
In order to prevent any. interference by France or Russia
England concluded a secret treaty with Germany regarding the
complete partition of Portuguese colonial possessions: Germany
is. to receive all Portugal's Asiatic possessions â that is to say,
TSmor, Goa, Damaio, Macao and Div, with 20.000 square miles
of territory and a million inhabitants. Germany further re
ceives in Africa all the Portuguese territory north of Mozam
bique, except. a strip of land three mile> wide for Cecil Rhodes'
trans-African railway. For this the German Government will
pay Portugal twenty-five million marks.
What surprises me in the statement of the Lokal Anzeiger
is that it refers to Asia, when I have been repeatedly assured at
the Foreign Office that the treaty only refers to Africa and
did not refer to Asia. It must, however, be remembered that
the Lokal Anzeiger was in position to publish the Samoa treaty
twenty-four hours before the official publication took place.
England receives the remaining African possessions of Por
tugal, which contain two million square kilometers and have
thirteen million inhabitants. The consent of Portugal to this
arrangement has already been obtained in principle. The Lo
kal Anzeigcr declares it has the news from such a source that

THE voters of this city by voting the
bonds for the extension of Golden
Gate Park yesterday have decreed
that tho new year shall mark th*
commencement of an era of
progress. New San Francisco Is no
longer a dream.
In every financial center of the world
the fart Is known to-day that San Fran
cisco has taken a bis leap forward and
that an enormous majority of her citi
zens have decided that it is their duty
to develop the work so well begun by the
sturdy pioneers half a century ago. The
victory for the advocates of progress is
bo marked that were the battle to be
fought over again the small minority
would doubtless vote to make it unani
mous.
The great public Interest in the ques
tion decided at the polls yesterday is
shown by a comparison with the new
charter election held in May of last year.
Just three thousand more voters have
proved that they are more interested in
park extensions than in a new charter
and there are nearly eight thousand
VOtn more anxious for parks than there
wore anxious for a new charter a year
and a half ago; and over four thousand
le?s voters are opposed to parks than
were opposed to the new charter. The
true significance of these figures is that
there is 60 per cent greater public Interest
in the material progress of the city than
in obtaining the much-vaunted new
organic law that in a few days will cause
the City Hall to turn a somersault.
For a special election there was an un
usually largo vote. The most sanguine
optimist only gambled that thirty thou
sand voters would visit the polls, while
many believed that twenty thousand
â¢would be nearer correct. The higher fig
ure was all but reached. The returns
show that the attempts to overthrow the
creation of the magnificent entrance to
the park by creating a feeling of sec
tionalism failed entirely, for In some of
the districts where the vote for the Im
provements might have been reasonably
expected to be light, It .wan disproportion
ately high. In the districts chiefly inhab
ited by worklngmen the vote shows that
facts and clear argument had Infinitely
more weight than sophistries and preju-
By the acts of the voters yesterday the
city will soon have a grand entrance to
her great park right in the heart of the
City. The Mission district will have a
playground two whole blocks in extent
and the Immense government reservation
at the Presidio will be connected by a
magnificent boulevard with tho extended
park system of the city. These features
of adornment, together with tho smaller
public squares distributed all over the
city, will make San Francisco notable for

what would be to the best advantage of every citizen and the result la now

judice and I am satisfied that no campaign was ever prosecuted more con
scientiously. San Francisco Is to be congratulated, for It has again been
proved that her citizens have Implicit faith In their new charter and are
confident that under It works of Improvement of great magnitude can
fafelybe undertaken. I have no doubt of the results of Frlday"Â» election.

It has been a hard task, but I feel that the grand result would have Jus

the starting point. San Francisco's appetite will soon be whetted so that she
will demand and acquire many similar Improvements.

PUBLIC SCHOOLS MENACED
BY POLITICAL BOSSES
Educators at Sacramento Discuss Present
Conditions and Suggest Remedies for
Existing Evils.
Prominent Speakers at the Teachers' Convention in Sacramento.
SACRAMENTO. Dec. 27. -The feature
of to-day's session of the State
Teachers' Association was a paper
by David Starr Jordan, president of
Stanford University, regarding
schools and politics, and a discussion of
the subject participated In by Benjamin
Ide Wheeler, I" George C. Pardee, Rev.
C.R. Brown and others.
David Starr Jordan in hi* paper stated
that the failure of democracy in the
United States was due to the Govern
ment's inability to conduct local business
on business principles. In the govern
ment of Groat Britain Just the reverse
was true. Quoting Dr. Wlllcox. Dr. Jor
dan f-aid that there are three funda
mental evils in the government of our
cities. The first consists th^ waste
of public funds, the second In the Inad
equacy of municipal service, and the
third is the corruption of civic authority
for the furtherance of Individual ends.
In addition to these three evils. which
were asserted to be common in all forms
of government, there were stated to be
three others In America, namely, the pri
vate control of public functions, th fed
eral organization of the city and th- lack
of Interest on the part of the people. The
twe of public franchises by the people and
corporations, and their corrupt control of
the officers of city and State. Is already
the basis of a vast amount of discussion.
Its natural remedy is the public perform
ance of public functions, a system which
hap also Its dangers and difficulties,. The
plan of electing School Trustees by ward-;
was deplored and a declaration was made
in favor of electing these trustees at
larpe.
Dr. Jordan stated that a sixth source
of Inefficiency In local government lies In
the fact that it Is not taken seriously. A
piece of gross corruption or Inefficiency
ends with a newspaper cartoon, which is
not accepted an evidence by the people,
who are used to unjust criticism In thin
form. The trouble is that the American
people are too good-humored. The sub
ordination of local to national affair* was
declared to be a great cause of weakness
and corruption. The plea that a bad man
must be chosen at home for the sake of
the party at large Is heard at every elec
tion and Is always false and degrading.
The failure of cities to give to their peo
ple good schools was attributed to the cor
ruption of civic authority for the further
ance of individual ends. The schools are
bad because the schools are tampered
with and used as tools to enrich or ad
vance those persons who have them in
charge. The action of teachers in tak
ing part In politics was touched upon and
besides these, a great many apply to us
In person for help or advice in Che matter.
WÂ« are prevented by United States stat
rom enlisting them and we have to
send them away. The only way they can
get into the army Is to go to England
and enlist on their own responsibility.
Hi.w many of them do this we have no
way of knowing. I think, however, that a
great many of them do enllat it la sur
g to notice th<^ various sorts and
conditions of m*-n who sock enlistment
with us. There Is scarcely a nationality
that Is not represented. English, of
course, predominate, but Americans are
second In number. It I? an Interesting
< lrcumstance that several United States
â oldtera In uniform have come here ajid
asked to be enllnted."
HINDOOS PRAY FOR
GREAT BRITAIN'S SUCCESS
NEW YORK. Doc. 27.â Hindoo astrr.|oÂ«
Kits. according to Bombay papers which
have JÂ«ft been x received, are connecting
the famine plague and British reverses
to the peculiar conjunction of the planets,
when on \he 15th of November seven
planets were In the sign of Scorpio. The
Hindoos of Bombay, therefore, to avert
further calamity and insure success to
the British arms, arranged for special
prayers and religious ceremonies at one
of their great temples. Seventy-five
learned Brahmins officiated. The first act
was the presentation of gifts to these
priests of valuable shawls and money.
The priests then Invoked divine blessing
on the rulers and ruled, and the people
sang hymns In Marathl and Gujarat!, of
which the Indian papers give the fol
lowing translation:
"God grant that the illustrious and
merciful Victoria may always enjoy per
fect peace and happiness; that feelings
of loyally may remain deeply rooted In
the hearts of her subjects, and that her
domain may be free from all foreign in
vasions. May all differences between the
rulers nn<l ruled vanish; may her Ma
jesty's subjects move on the path of
righteousness; may all treason disappear:
may famine and pestilence fly away; may
the people of the Transvaal come to re
pent their acts of folly, and may her Ma
jesty's forces gain glory and success on
the fields of battle in Africa."
At the elope of the service three cheers
given tor the long life, glory and
success of hi r Majesty, the Queen Em-

There were no more trains that night. The

SEDITION AMONG
DUTCH COLONISTS
LONDON. Dec. 28.â A ppecial corre
spondent of the Dally Chronicle, tele
graphing from Sterkstroom, Cape Colony,
Thursday, December 21. says:
"Strong measures are necessary to
chf-ok the hostile feellngr amnnf the
Putrh colonists, whone sedition Is shown

be rewarded, and it replaced by a pull on
a political boM it would be distinctly de
grading on the teacher. children, quick
to pick up things, would soon learn how
the teacher got her Job and would soon
attempt to exercise a pull on the teacher.
P. Alexander Bergeiot. president of the
San Francisco Board of Education,
thought that the chief causes of the evil
were the election of school trustees- by
popular vote, the method of examining
teachers by the county boards and the
lack of uniformity in the selection of
teachers. He suggested as a remedy na
tionalization and centralization of the
schools under a uniform system of laws
He held that examinations should only be
conducted upon plans formulated by a
board listing of the president and the
professors of the different State univer
sities.
Frank H. Short of Fresno took a pes
simistic vi?w of things, seeming to fear
that the tnd of the nation might come
through political bosses and i irruption
if teachers did not impart to their pupils
true Ideas of good citizenship. ..
Benjamin Ide Whe< : â  closed the discus
sion with a brief talk that was applauded
at frequent Intervals. He expressed him
self as sorry that so much had been said
against politics and not one word !n itÂ«
favor.
Political methods were declared to be
part of the machinery for getting the
Government In running order and every
man should be a politician. The old elec
toral system of choosing a President of
the I'nttvd States showed how our fore
fathers had f-ared to place this function
directly in the hands of the people, but
the politicians had manipulated th:- so
that now the electoral college was obso
lete and stood upon the statute books as
a something: that might some day get
us Into trouble. He declared that as par
ty organizations and party leaders are
'*~-"*/Â» the sooner we recognize this the bet
ter and Â«hat all citizens should take part
In such organization. At the present time
there was to much work of the Govern
ment that whs highly specialized that it
witS being taken out of the hands of the
politicians and placed in the hands of ex
perts. As teachers are experts they
should be chosen by educators and not
by a body of men elected by the whole
people without regard to their qualifica
tions, and the safest way to get profes
sional excellence was to Invest speclul
lbts with the appointive power.
Several departmental meetings were
held at which business of a purely tech
nical nature was transacted. To-night
the teachers of Sacramento gave a recep

AugUstUl Van Oeisen of L'pper Montclalr.
in uncle oi Mrs. Doremus. who Is now at

1.. 1., und who has been advised of the
news. it was thl* Henry Doremus who
.iisappeared from his home about two
years u^o. {caving a note on a ferry boat
iunnir.K between lioboken .â¢...i New York
Â«a>ing that he was tired of life and had
jumped overboard. He appeared two
weeks later at his father* houso. a'tÂ«?i
having been mourned as dead.
T. A. Do re mus left home suddenly on
December 13 and that night left a hat
and note in a stateroom on the steamer
.Maine of the Providence and Stonlngton
line. The note read:
"Please notify Mrs. T. A. Doremus of
L'pper Montc'atr that I have thrown my
soli overboard. THERON DOREMUS."
The next day and since then Mrs. Dore
miu has mourned her husband as dead.
but the missing man's friends have stead
ily held that he would be heard from.
It is now stated that Mr. Doremus had
spoken ol taking a trip to California in
the hope of benefiting his health. He has
been a great sufferer from a complica
tion of diseases and recently met a finan
cial reverse, which aggravated the d:*
ease and perhaps unbalanced his mind.
His place of business was closed last
week by an attachment from the Sheriffs
office for one of his creditors and the
slock was removed.

LOS ANGELES. Dec. 27.â Theron A.
Doremus, who disappeared from New

be would jump from a steamer, occupies
room 33 In the Hotel Gray, corner Third
and Main streets. When .seen to-night
he presented a pitiable appearance. 111.-!
physical sufferings are acuie. as his legÂ«Â»
are swollen out of shape by rheumatism.
Of slender build, pray bearded, bordering
on GO years of age, his suffering was in
tensely pathetic. Doremua in clearly a
victim hi paresis, and as he fails to re
call a single instance of his past, except
to weep when speaking of his wife and
two sons, It la evident that he suffered
from temporary aberration when he mys
teriously disappeared from Upper Mont
clalr, N. J.. wnere, according to his state
ment, he ha* for years been engaged In
the flour and feed trade.
ii.- arrived in Los Angeles on Saturday
last and wandered about until he en
tered the Hotel Gray, where the landlady
out of sympathy assigned him a room.
According to li â¢: statement he admitted
his poverty anu said he had only $1 70. He
had no baggage and no change of linen.
In a broken conversation Doremus said
he did not remember when he left home,
on what train he traveled or what ciu-'S
he passed. He could not recall that he
ever was pn a steamer in New York, ot
that be lett a note adare.sseu to any wDe.
He did not remember that he made any
attempt to commit euictde. or the reason
why he came to Los Angeles.
"1 realized to-day that I was In Los
Angeles," he said. " but I wish .-or â¢ one
would get me horne â but they cannot do
it until this awful buzzing in my head is
stopped."
Doremus evidently realizes his helpless
ness, as he to-day applied through Dr.
Kirkpatrick for admission to the County
Hospital, where he says he will go 10
1 morrow If he can be moved* As he be
longs to Cliff Lodge. Royal Arcanum, the
members of the order will to-morrow be

MIXED MARRIAGES

.atch to IT- *iTI
ST LOUIS. Dec 27.-Archbishop Kaln
to-Â«lay received a communication from
Mgr. Mnrtlnolll. the apostolic delegate at
Washington, saying that th* recent de
cree l^ued from Home regarding,lndul
gences and other favors ffom the Pope,
â¢io^s not in any way abridge tho faculties
heretofore held by P.lshop? and Arch
bitfhops of issuing dispensations for mixed
m:irrl.iKrÂ»*. The message from Mgr. Mar
tlnclli was in rt-ply to a request from the
Archbishop for a ruling on the question.
Archbishop Corrigan of New York last
week sent a circular to his clergymen,
which gave rise to the report that no dis
pensa.tior.s could be obtained during the
Jubilee > <>ar. r xcept directly from th- Vat
ican. The statement of the upostolic
delegate rfTrctually settles this question.
It If explained that the dispensation for
tho marriage of a Catholic and one of a
different faith is issued only in the name
of the Holy Father. Without the seal of
the Holy bee the document would have
no authority: en that, in this cu.Â«Â«e. the
wish of the Pope that Rome shall be "the
real fountain of mercy and spiritual
favors for the Catholics of the entire
world" during the coming year will still
be rarried out.

The indications are that the hearing in
the case will consume considerable time.
1 Montanans ban Indicated a will
ingness to come to Washington to testify,
but the committee is determined to hold
the list down to ad narrow limits us pos
sible because of the expense of bruin ing
persons no great a distance. Among those
who probably will be asked to attend are
a number of members of the Legislature

Boxer Joe Kennedy required the full
twenty rounds In his bout with Fred Rus
sell before the Western Athletio Club last
night to gain the decision. lit. was th. 1
aggressor throughout, but his loud sound
ing blows on head and body wore not suf
ficiently damaging to put Russell out. The
latter proved a surprise afUir. the .first
minute of boxing. lie had greatly Im
proved over the form he displayed with
Van Buskitk, but is yet far. from being a
proficient ' workman in the ring. He
â bowed himself clever at blocking, but a
mere novice at attack. His blows were
never effective, although he landed a
number of devt-r rights on the head.
The one quality in which he showed the
greatest development was in gamencss.
Kennedy rrpiied his left to the stomach
repeat doubling up his lanky oppo
nent, but the latter took his punishment
without wincing. His. mouth was badly
' cut and bled profusely, but this did net
teem to disconcert him. â â .-..â  ,
The betting opened and closed with Ken

tenflanee was mall, it being considered a
foregone conclusion that Kennedy,, ...
boxer that he is, would virtually win in a
walk.
Before the men commenced nroceedingi
It wits announced that Charlie - In* "f
Watsonville challenged the timer to tight

Jim McDonald refereed the main fight
and lost no time sending the men to
gether. Kennedy was at once tin the ag
gressive, landing right and left on body
and repeating the trick before Russell
woke up. Russell seemed slow and awk
ward nd the crowd commenced to Jeer
him. He hung on In the clinches and
would not break away. The Jeering was
changed to cheering In a moment, when
Russell rushed his antagonist, landing
two left swings on the head and sending
Kennedy to the ropes. He landed a
number of swinging blows, but did little
damage.
Russell was the aggressor In the second
round, but Kennedy Boon stopped him
with some short-arm jolts on the body.
Each landed on the other's body and Rus
sell made a desperate swing, overstepping
his opponent. Kennedy went at him, but
mlssea. For a time It was give and take,
Russell landing on the body and then
ducking Into an uppercut. Kennedy fol
lowed this with a straight left on the
head n.i then tried for a knockout, but
failed.
Russell landed right and left on the
head in the third round. Kennedy replied
with a brace ot stiff ones on the body and
a left on the head. Russell stepped In,
landing a right on the body and getting
one in return.. Kennedy landed again on
face and body, both being resounding

Russell was the first to try In the
fourth, landing lightly on the head. Ken
nedy sent his left to the body twice and
followÂ«*d with two stiff Jabs. Russell
chased Kennedy around the ring,. but his
Sallop was stopped with a left that
oubied him up like a Jack-knife.
Russell hung on to Kennedy in the sixth
while the latter peppered him with both
hands. on body and head. Russell took
Kennedy unawares, near the end of the
round and landed a terrific right on the
'head, but the damage was not In keeping
with its apparent force. In the beginning
of the seventh Kennedy landed right and
left and sent Russell to the floor. He was
up again inside of five seconds and landed
on Kennedy but withont effect. Kennedy
tired a trifle In the eighth, but had the
better of the argument throughout.
From the tenth round to the end Ken
Â»edy played for the body, and for the
greater part of the time was the aggres
sor. Once In a. while Russell rushed and
landed, but he never seemed to have Ken
nedy In serious difficulty. From the four
teenth.round Russell looked the picture of
dlstrosp. but was game to the end.
When ill' twenty rounds were up Ref

OTIS ATTEMPTING TO
CHECK CORRUPTION
WASHINGTON, Dec. -The adjutant
general has received a copy of an order
recently issued by General Otis, aiming
at the suppression of bribery, which, it
is reported, has been extensively practiced
in the Philippines. General Otis says the
persistence oi these reports, touching both
the military and civil service in the isl
ands, has forced, him to the conclusion
that there may be some foundation for
the general charge. He cautions all com
manding officers, heads' of departments
and others in authority to probe, to the
bottom any such reports that may reach
them, and announces that all offenses of
this order will be suppressed with a
utronif . hand. ;.â¢â¢â¢>

NORTHtHN LIGHT LOADtD WITH HAY FOR HONOLULU
Fodder Is so scarce In Hawaii that $43 a ton la being offered for hay. The
regular vessels plying between here and the islands cannot carry enough of the
feed to supply the demand, and in consequence every vessel that can be pro
cured Is being loaded and rfent down. The Northern Light has been taken out
of the lumber trade in order to carry hay. It will be piled up ten feet high
on her deck, and it will be housed In, in order to save it from the salt water.

FLAMORA
COVERED A
FAST MILE
Lowered the Colors of Erwin
and Advance Guard
in J:39 3-4.
In one of the grandest contested two
year-old struggles witnessed this season
at Oakland track, Flamora, the smooth
going daughter of Flambeau and Fannie
Lewis, defeated Erwln and Advance
Guard over a mile, covering the distance
In 1:39\, equaling the world's record for
two-year-cUijj, but recently made by Ad
vance Guard. The latter colt shouldered
but 93 pounds when he set the mark,
while in y^ rjce, Flamora carried

breakaway from the post. "Tad 1 " Walsh
cut into the lead at the turn, and was
never headed. Erwln, the contender
throughout, fell short by half a length at
the wire, with Advance Guard a scant
two lengths away. The favorite seeou 1
to get all tangled up after being cut oj
on the first turn, nniahlng nfth, behind
Rixford.
The lields in nearly every instance were
large, and a mishap at the start was liable
to ruin a horse s chance of scoring The
winners were: buyuue 7 to 1, L>on Luis S
to 1, Stuttgart h to 5. Faunette 6 to a
Flamora 4 to 1 and Allenna 7 to 2. Stutt

A big field of fourteen platen started in

closing a slight favorite over Heartless

racing luck, Eddie Jonen, on the last

Faunette, from the stable of W J
Spiers, took the mile and a quarter run
from a big field of twelve, covering t!i#
route in ZMhi, dangerously close to t^e
coast record. The mare was favorite and
In a long drive nosed out Tempo, a 15 to

Tempo was quietly backed at odds' of

COAL FAMINE
PREVAILS ON
WATERFRONT
Teamsters in Line for
Ten Days.
ANOTHER FUEL SHIP ON FIRE
HENRY B. HYDE REACHES VAL
PARAISO IN DISTRESS.
There has never been such a scramble
for coal on the water front M there Is
at the present time. The Wellington,
Iloslyn. Southtleld* and other fuels which
are most In demand cannot be procured
for love or money, and In consequence
there, Is almost a famine among the re
tailers. Some of the teamsters have been
in line for ten days awaiting a chance to
pet a load, and In consequence there h.TÂ»
been quite a number of disturbances, ami
live policemen .re constantly 01. the Lv.it
to kÂ».p the peace.
The ship Louis Walsh, arrived Tuesday
night with -!"" tons of Itoslyn coal, and
yesterday afternoon there was not un
ounce of It left. The steamer Wellington
arrived yesterday with Â£30 tofts of Wel
lington coal, and last night the compuny
announced that there waa none of th<Â»
cargo left. At that time there wero
enough wagons In line walling for a. load
to carry away COCO tons. All of these will
have to remain on the spot until the next
steamer gets In or else they will loÂ«o
their places and chances of getting un
early load. Charles 11. Allen has had no
Buuthfleld Wellington to give dealers since
last October, but he has now a chance to
get some of it Into the market again, and
that will relieve the situation somewhat.
A few more steam colliers have, been se
cured for the trade, and as soon as they
can make one or two trips the famine
will be over. At the present time, how
ever, coal is the scarcest thing on the
water front. : â¢
Norfolk, Va., coal does not seem to be
a very safe cargo. Tuesday the ship
Kennebec caught tire while discharging at
Mare Island, while yesterday the Mer
chants' Exchange received word that the
Henry B. Hyde put Into Valparaiso with
her cargo on fire. Both vessels have Nor
folk coal aboard. The owners of the Ken
nebec did not like the cargo, and 15 per
cent reinsurance was paid on her before
she reached this port. The Hyde Is one
of the fleet purchased by the California
Shipping Company from Flint it Co.. and
her new owners were expecting her to
reach Honolulu early next monthr Cap
tain McLeod was to nave left for the Isl
ands on the Marlposa to take charge of
the vessel, but when the news cam thnt
she had put into Valparaiso in distress ha
decided to remain In San Francisco for
another month. The chances are that the
Hyde will have to discharge her cargo,
and in that event it will be a couple of
months before she reaches Honolulu.
The Brltibh ship King Geor#s has ar
rived at Antwerp after a very rough tun-*
on the way. When off the Horn she was
caught in some heavy weather and con
siderably damaged. She left here on Au
gust 7 >ast with â¬3.023 rentals of barley
valued at $63,000. and 17.257 centals of rye
valued at 115.600.
A fleet of transports arrived at Manila
yesterday. The Duke of Fife and St.
Paul which left here November 21; thÂ«
Indiana, which sailed two days later, and
the Ohio, which sailed November "\. all
got In at thÂ« same time. Thia will give
Otis two more regiments with which to
follow up the Filipinos.
The transport Sheridan Is going to Se
attle to load as soon as Â»he Is coaled and
the Valencia, which arrived from Manila
a few days ago. may go back with com
missariat stores. The Aztec went to
Harrison street wharf yesterday to take
on her load of horses. She will probably
sail Saturday.
Patrick Quinn. a laborer, was seriously
Injured .while working on the Dow build
ing, now In course of erection at First
and Natoma streets. A -plank fell from
thÂ« second story and the sharp point
struck him on the head. At the Harbor
Hospital Drs. Robinson and Davis .lid
what they could for him. but Dr. H?lnta
told them not to perform an operation
until he came. down. This was about 11
a. m. and at 1:30 p. m Heintz had not
put in an appearance, so the friends <â ?
the injured man Insisted upon taking him
to St. Mary's Hospital. Dr. Robinson is
of the opinion that Qulan's skull was
fractured.
â  The Harbor Commissioners held a short
session yesterday and let a contra far
building a new storehouse for the Somh
ern Pacific to William F. News-. for
SS99. The old storehouse now used by the
company Is to be torn down to make
room for the postofflce.
The scow schooner PAR No. 8 Is to
be sold to pay her debts. Albert R. .Marks,
the captain and owner, has been un
able to make both ends meet for some
time past, so Gray Bros., who* hold a
mortgage on the vessel, are going to sell
her at auction on January. 9.
The mall steamer Marlposa got away
for Hawaii. Samoa and Australia â¢ last
night. She carried a large passenger list
for this time of the year and a full cargo.

COMMERCIAL KNIGHTS OF THE ROAD
WHOOP UP THEIR ANNUAL SESSION
Some Iravelers and Others Who Took Leading Parts in the Proceedings.
THE annual session of the Pacific Coast Commercial
Travelers' Association took place yesterday In Native
Sons* Hall. It was a lively affair from the start to
the finish. There was a Ftrongr fight over an amend
ment to change the monthly dues. This being disposed of.
then the travelers turned their attention to providing for
themselves a club In which they can receive their friends,
and this new Institution will soon come Into existence.
Then there was a hot discussion on the subject of having
the officers of the association elected from the floor, in
stead of by the directors of the association, as formerly.
This preposition was very popular and it nearly carried.
But. as the nmÂ«ndment to the by-laws required a unan
imous vote, it met with disaster unexpectedly. When tho
first trial vr- was made there were several dissenting
voices. Then a standing vote was demanded, and every
traveler but one voted for the amendment. The one
negative vote killed the amendment. A delegation of the
Pacific Coast Jobbers' and Manufacturers' Association,
consisting of A C Rulofson and Brace Hayden. told tho
travelers all about the merits of tho defensive fight that
the Pacific Coast la making against the demands of the
Middle West jobbers, and asked the travelers to take
up the work of education ns they travel.
President Thomas E. Dunno presided. Before the
regular proceedings ho requested that the delegation from
the Jobbers' sni Manufacturers' Association should be
heard. The first speaker was Mr. Rulofson. He said that
while the suit before the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion originated in St. Louis, the "fight was really that
of th. entlro Middle Westâ from the Missouri River to
the Alleghany Mountainsâ for the trade of the Pacific
roast. AM wholesale houses on this coast were the real
defendant although the suit was against the railroads.
Should the St. Louis proposition carry the result would
be disastrous to the houses that employed travelers, and
the travelers cculd see that that meant trouble for them.
There was a mistaken idea among some of the retail
ers of the State that the St. Louis side of the case was
thÂ» one for then to take up. A Chicago merchant had
publicly said that the Pacific Coast had no right to do
a Jobbing business. St. Louis and th*Â» other cities of the
Middle West were trying to take away all the territory
that the Pacific Coast had. Their programme would
bring the Eastern department stores In direct competi
tion with the coast Jobbers. Brace Hayden spoke in the

tion had not pained any members In the past year.
On the other hand, owing to few deaths and small ex
. the funds hud been Increased! and there was
about $14."00 on hand.
These reports were made by Secretary A. C. Bolde
mann and Trer surer B. B. Gallant. The reports formeJ
the basis of the discussion that Immediately followed on
the subject of the proposed amendments to the by
laws.
The talk was lons and animated. Before It was over
half a dozen men were on their feet at the same time,
trying to pot a chance to speak. One traveler withdrew
nbershlp dues, which was equivalent to resigna
tion from the association. The upshot of the whole mat

and It was v â¢â¢â¢'. to furnish clubrooms with the In

The amendment to have the officer? elected from the

MRS. GALLAGHER
CHARGED WITH
MANSLAUCHTER
Her Alleged Victim
Passes Away.
THE POLICE PROMPTLY ACT
STATEMENT OF THE WOMAN
BEFORE SHE DIED.
She Accused Her Employer of Hav
ing Dragged Her Out of Bed
and Then Assaulting
Her.
Mrs. Caleb, the aged woman, who claim
ed she had been beaten by Mrs. Gallagher
of 10 Alvarado street, as has already
been told In The Call, died In St. Mary's
Hospital yesterday afternoon. As soon
as her death was reported to Captain Bo
hen he ordered Policemen McMurray and
Graham to arrest Mrs. Gallagher.' They
found her at her home and took her Into
custody. At the City Prison she was
charged with manslaughter.
According to Mrs. Caleb's statement,
which she made shortly after having been
taken to the hospital, she advertised for a
position to do light housework in some
respectable family. Mrs. Gallagher an
swered the advertisement and after a
short conversation she agreed to engace
her alleged victim. A short time after
ward. Mrs. Caleb claimed. Mrs. Gallagher
assaulted her, inflicting the injuries from
which she died.
Mrs. Gallagher, when seen in the City
Prison last night, emphatically denied
that shÂ« ever raised her hand to Mrs.
Caleb.
"On the night she claimed I struck her," ,
she said. "I was out with mv husband
and did not return homo until late. As
we entered the house 1 found Mrs. Caleb
lying on the floor of her room, bleeding
from a cut in her bead. She told me she ,
had fallen while preparing to retire for
the night and had lain in the position j
in which I found her for several hours.
I washed the blood off her head and put
her to bed. a few days later, as her
condition steadily grew worse. I had her
sent to St. Mnry's Hospital. At the
proper time I will produce a witness who [
saw her fall in her room."
Mrs. Gallagher's statement is much at I
variance with that told by Mrs. Caleb. '
In the presence of Sergeant Colby and ;
Policeman Heynemann. she declared that '
Mrs. Gallagher seemed to have tempor- â 
arily lost her reason, and rushing Into .

out of bed. As she lay prostrate on the
floor, she claimed, Mrs. Gallagher i
edljr struck her. Her screams attracted
the attention of a lodger In the house,
and he went to Mrs. Caleb*! assistance.
After considerable trouble, itae alleged,
he finally succeeded In pacifying Mrs.
Gallagher and Inducing her to leave the
room. This statement is branded as false
by Mrs. Gallagher.
"An autopsy test night showed that the
unfortunate woman had died from the
effects of the injuries she received,
whether accidental or not.

The warrant for such an offer goes back of the plan

England offered, to mediate between Fr: nee and the
United States. In 1844 France offered her good
offices between Spain and Morocco. In 1847 England
offered to mediate between Portugal and her insur
gent subjects. In 1F49 England and France offerei
to mediate between the King of Naples and the in
surgent Sicilians. In 1861 both France and Russia
offered good offices between the United States and
the Confederate State*. In 1865 the United States
offered mediation betuccn Spain and the South
American republics. In many other instances such
offer* have been a^e. ending with the tender by
Sir Julian Pauncefote of the good offices of Great
Britain. Germany. Austria. France. Italy and Russia
between this country and Spain. In none of these
cases was the offer taken as an unfriendly act. or as

SON FRANCISCO THE BEAUTIFUL.
BY an overwhelming majority the voters of San
I have declared themselves in favor of
â HjiÃllilifl the v..rk that is to make their city
one of the most beautiful on the earth. The long pe
riod of municipal stagnation following the movement
highest achievement in the establish
ment of Golden Gate Park has ended. A new im
ird progress takes up the work where it
nd by arranging for the extension of
rk panhandle to the junction of Market street
â venae inaugurates another period of
-ment and ment.
The campaign of education required to bring about
! popular sentiment in favor of beautifying the city ha*
' been a long one. In September. 1897. the Park Com
j mission recommended the establishment of a grand
, driveway connecting Golden Gate Park with the Pre
! sidio. Shortly afterward The Call began its rnemor
| able scries of articles on the subject of beautifying the
i city and urgently advocated the purchase of the land
intervening between the City Hall and Market street
so as to provide a City Hall Park that would be an
ornament to our main thoroughfare and serve to en
hance the attractiveness and impressiveness of the
1 building itself.
In response to the urging of The Call, supported as
it was by a large number of men of light and leading.
1 the Mayor appointed a commission to investigate ami
report upon the subject. The commission broadened
its work and took into consideration the whole
problem of municipal improvement. Among other
'. powers it .obtained from the Supervisors was the right
1 to consider and report upon the approximate cost of
extending the park panhandle to Van Ness avenue.
The privilege was granted November 2, 1807.
Although nothing came directly from the labors of
j that commission its efforts were not fruitless. Indi
! rectly the benefits were many. Thanks to its reports
; and to the earnest advocacy by The Call of a system-
I Â«tic course of municipal improvement, the minds of
the people were turned to such thoughts. Various
I plans for improving the city began to receive more
earnest consideration than before, and popular senti
ment in favor of them strengthened from month to
month. \
As long ago as November 17, 1807, The Call said:
' "There has grown up in San Francisco an aspiration
, for municipal beauty. and the feeling is shared by the
, great majority of influential citizens. We are be
ginning to understand something of the possibilities
that lie before the city so happily situated and so
marked by nature for a high destiny among the great
capitals of the earth. In that understanding we recog
nize the importance of making it beautiful as weil as
; rich: that it may not be inferior to any of the cities
i of the age."
In the recent campaign which has come to so
i glorious a victory for progress the forces that were on
the side of improvement included almost every pro
gressive element in the community. The Merchants'
: Association, the various improvement clubs, nearly
every newspaper, and a sterling host of active, erier
i getic, public-spirited men. took an earnest part in it
'> and helped to win the fight against silurianism. The
result iÂ« therefore one for general congratulation, in
which all can ''.are.

OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL LAW
PRESIDENT BURK of the State Teacher^ As-
L~y sociation in his address before that body at the
convention in Sacramento set forth a pro
gramme of action which if resolutely undertaken is
likely to become one of the chief issues of State poli
tics. It is designed to bring about a radical change
in our system of public school administration. To
quote Mr Burk's own language: "We need a new
law Inch shall preserve for the local boards every
authority which does not deal with the professional
and technical side of education, but distinctly giving
these problems to an officer of supervision, who, in
turn, must present credentials of some kind which
shall guarantee a high degree of competency in schol
arship, broad pedagogic insight into the educational
problems of the day, and practical methods for their
solution."
There will be in this demand for a new policy of
school administration nothing surprising to those
who have given any consideration to the meaning of
certain recent tendencies in American life. We are
striving to reach a higher plane in all departments of
public activity. We wish better municipal govern
ment and we devise charters upon new principles in
order to attain it. We reconstruct the old administra
tive system of universities to give to the executive
officer- of those institutions larger powers than their
predecessors id. and m many other ways give evi
dences of a movement toward a new era of things.
It is inevitable that the public schools should be af
fected by the tendency and share in its impulses.
The object of all these changes is to fulfill Napo
leon's saying. "The tools to him who can use them."
The administration of great institutions cannot be
well achieved except by men who have a sufficient
amount of technical training and professional expe
rience to know how to direct their machinery. Our
great universities are no longer managed mainly by
trustees who are better fitted for the affairs of com
merce and finance than for those of education, and
sooner or later the public schools will be adapted to
the model set by the universities. Those great tools
of popular instruction will be given into the hands of
those who know how to use them instead of being
as at present in the hands of thoxe who not infre
quently know hardly any other use for them than that
of providing places for political job-chasers.
In view of the charge made by one John Kane that
he was bitten by a member of the Police Department
it woÂ«!d -eem that Supervisor Kalben's ordinance to
muzzle greyhound* mi^ht be amended so as to in
clude hungry policemen.
President Steyn of the Ofangt Free State says that
might does not always mean ri^ht. He probably
threw the remark out as a consoling thought to the
British.
THE PAN FRANCISCO CALL. THURSDAY, DECEMBER 2S. \S9<X
IT is probable that there is only talk in the Fenian
invasion of Canada. Unless such a movement
were under the Boer flag and commission it wou'd
be outside the laws of war and of nations, and those
engaged in it would have no recognition as lawiul
combatants and would suffer the extreme penalty it
taken under arms.
Even if it were recognized by the two republics and
under their flag its origin within the United States
could not be permitted, for it would be the gravest
breach of international law that can be committed.
This Government could only join.England in prevent
'by the strictest repression. It is a case in
which antagonism to the policy of England and sym
pathy for the Boer- cannot be permitted to so se
y embroil the United States in a distant quarrel.
Ii an uprising occur on Canadian soil, in the first in
stance, and >oldiers of fortune choose to take their
in their hands by joining it. the risk is theirs.
But this country cannot be permitted to become the
drill and supply ground on which hostile expeditions
are trained and equipped to make \rar upon a flag
with which we are at peace.
Th< troubles in which the Spanish war has
â me of harboring a revolutionary iuma
in New York and supplying it with means to main
tain a revolution against Spain. The men who did
that were no more than nominal citizens of the
L'nite-i States, it they wore even that, and used such
color of citizenship as they had only to protect them
selves in waging war in violation of the neutral rights
of Spain.
When men bona-flde accept American citizenship
their first duty is to the welfare of this country.
That duty is higher than any ancient national grudge
or inherited hatred they may have brought to our
â¢
We cannot afford an asylum to all the hatreds of
Europe, not permit each to organize war on our soil
apainst enemies with' .vhom this country is at peace.
1 lie law makes it a felony for a citizen to accept,
while within the jurisdiction of the United State?, a
-ry commission to serve any foreign Govern
ment - â¢ ',ne with which we are at peace. It is
p1Â«o a klony to. for like purpose, enlist or procure en
li-tment. Foreigners tran-iently on our soil are not
included in this. Our law further provides that if any
n shall, within the territory or jurisdiction of
the United States, whether citizen or alien, begin or
foot "T prepare or provide the means for any
military expedition or enterprise to be carried on
from thence against the territory or dominions of any
,n prince or state, or of any colony, district >r

It will be Â«een. then, that every feature of the pro

Every citizen, native and naturalized, comes within

do these unlawful acts within our jurisdiction. Those
who contemplate this movement. if such there be,
Â»iÂ»or.' irlv that instead of helping the Boers
and hurt:- Britain they will only harm them
selves and him the United States. If they owe Eng
land a grudge, or if they are patriotically impelled to

principles, there ;- only one way : i â  !<> rithcr. Let

the fichtintj men of the two republics, right in the
center of the trouble.
They can gain nothing by criminal acts committed
on our soil, which are primarily against our Govern
ment because in violation of its hrws.
In the present tension ol international relations all
over the world American citizens owe it to themselves
and their country to ohey the law. If the rcportc!
movement take shape at all this Government will he
compelled to prevent it by all means in its power.
Military and civil authority will he invoked, a costly
military patrol and guard of the Canadian boundary
will be necessary, and our taxpayer- will havr to bear
the additional burden ol restraining an unlawful enter
prise started by those whose first duty is to this
country and its la.vs.
Now that young Churchill, the aristocratic war cor
respondent, has managed to pet himself safe out of

BY the action of the Board of Supervisors in
passing to print the resolutions of Supervisor
Aigeltinger forbidding telephone companies to
exact from the patrons of their nickel-in-the-slot ma
chines the deposit of a nickel until after the desire-l
switch has been made and the party has responded
there is given to the public something like an assur
ance of protection against what has been very much
in the nature of a petty swindle. When the resolu
tions are put into force the patrons of the telephone
Mot machines will have for their money something
more than information that the desired party is out
or that the line is engaged. â¢
The resolutions arc carefully drawn and decla:
under a penalty of fine or imprisonment or both that
"no corporation, firm, individual or copartnership"
operating, or which may hereafter operate, a tele
phone line, or render telephone service, within the
city and county of San Francisco shall charge or re
ceive any compensation for any telephone message or
communication in any instance before the telephone
number or party called for shall respond to the call
of. or on behalf of, the person ordering the >er
vice."
This resolution, taken in connection with the for*
mer order of the board imposing a fair license tax
upon each nickel-in-thc-slot telephone machine in the
city, promises to be 01 great advantage to the com
munity. By them the public is assured first that the
service f<Â«r which the telephone company is paid irill
be rendered, and second that the city will derive a
revenue from the enormous profits which the tele
phone corporations derive from their monopoly of
what has now become a public necessity.
Thus this Board of Supervisors in the closing
weeks of the term has added another to the many
beneficial acts of local legislation which mark its
record. It has once more demonstrated its fidelity to
the campaign pledge* of the majority of its members
and to the true interests of the city It has set an
example which the incoming board will do well to
emulate.
Senator Morgan is having such a hard time in his
f>ght for re-election that some of his friends say he is
making his way back to office through a slough of
political mud that reaches neck high.
In five weeks the lawyers in the famous Molineux
case have made 6500 objections. There must be
some terrible truth hidden somewhere in that case.

was taken up by an attendance that was thoroughly Interested and extremely
entertained by the exhibition In the tanbarlc ring. The programme was a va
ried one. There were evolutions, vaulting, tandem riding. Jumping, high Jump
ing and more Jumping, and every number was greeted with applause that nearly
frightened the horses out of the ring.
"Evolutions by Two Little Angels" was the first on the programme, and
this v.as followed by a grand entree by the members of the club. The latter
number consisted In riding around the ring in all kinds of fashions under the
direction of Captain Dillon. After this the ringmaster got a long line on a
horse that galloped around the ring and Charlie de Young and Grey Rick took
turns in vaulting on and off the animal's back and hanging on while the horse
skipped over a hurdle. They acted their parts with all the agility and grace of
circus rldfrs. Mr. de Young was especially expert.
There was a side-step number, In which two horses obeying the guidance of
their skillful riders went around the ring without going ahead or backing up.
Mr. Grayson did a very clever act on a horse pans saddle, sans bridle. He
stemed to have telephonic communication with the animal through his whip,
for by m> :mÂ«Â« of gentle taps he made it jump over coal oil boxes and do other
tricks while he maintained hiÂ« equilibrium on Its back. A tandem ride by Mr.
Flournoy and Mrs. Lent was one of the features of the show. After the enter
tainment the members of the club gave a supper to the audience. The affair
was pronounced a grand success. â¢

CAUSE OF THE WARâGretchen.
City. The principal cause of the war In

TO BE AN ACTORâ N. 0.. City. A
young man with a common school educa
tion may become an actor, that is, one
kind of an actor, but if he is ambitious
and wishes to rise high in the profession
he should have the qualifications that
are given In the chipping Inclosed in the
letter of inquiry, namely: First of all
he should be of graceful figure, and, of
course, young. Then, education Is of the
utmost Importance. The man with a col
lege education In nine cases out of ten
in all career* has the advantage of a
man without such an education. He
should be able to converse In at leant two
foreign languages, an*! not only be able
to converse, but be able to pronounce
properlyâ how often are we Irritated and
annoyed by the mispronunciation of for
eign words on the stage, and let me say
that such Ignorance Is an Insult to an
audience. He should be able to dance,
sing and fence, all perfectly. He should
have a thorough knowledge of French
and English literature.

EXTENT OF BORLINI'S
THEFT NOT YET KNOWN
Accused Declares He Has Not Em=
bezzled the Bank's Money.
Passing the Burden of Prosecution Around
From Bank to Surety Company by
Interested Parties.
: LOVE my wife with an all-absorbing' |
passion," said Alfred A. Borlinl last
night In the offices of the Morse De- '
iÂ± tective Agency, '"and that is why I i
married her. She Is my wife, and ;
though It has been Bald she repudiated me
when the charges of embezzlement were
made, she Is stfll my wife, and my love
for her forbids my discussing this episode
Of my misfortunes.
"I am not an embezzler. When the
books . arc thoroughly experted it will be
â  found that no defalcation exists. I have
not stolen the bank's money. No discrep- I
I ancy exists on account of my dishonesty, '
â¢ and this entire affair, when probed to
the bottom, will resolve Itself Into a com
i plete exoneration for me."
That is the young bank-teller's version
of thu charges brought against him by '
j the officials of the American Bank and
Trust Company, declaring Borlini to be a .
I defaulter to the extent of about $8000. His 'â 
' statements are antipodal to those of the |
detectives employed in the case , the offi- ,
i cere of the bank, the attorneys and the
i natural conclusions drawn from bis own i
, actions. The books of tho bank have been
: experted and according to the findings
Borlini is accused of embezzlement.
But mere than this, the detectives who
. have been shadowing the young clerk
claim to have secured a. confession of
guilt from him. Their story is like night
and day when compared with Borlini's
self-exculpation. They say that the ac- â 
cused admitted that he was a defaulter,
â  even to the amount of $7000, and that hid
! mind was harrowed with the awful strain
| put upon him by his own consciousness of '
his guilt and the ever present fear of dis- ,
covery. Tortured and driven nearly mad '
i by the mental pain his actions had en
tailed he decided to end his suspense and
1 force the issue: After it wsu> all over
[ and the defalcation brought to light Bor- '.
' Hal returned from hi* honeymoon and re-
I signed himself to his fate.
Just what the extent of the defalcation
Is has not yet been ascertained. The bank
1 officials admit that it will reach (MOO. but
there are others who assert that It will
' It fully $5000 to $10,000 more than this. But
$5000 is secured by bonds given by the
: American Surety Company of New York.
! The discrepancy Is what the bank Is after
' and prosecution will be held in abeyance
until Borlini's attorney offers a better set
i tlement than has at, yet been forthcom
ing.
â¢ I did not play the races." said the for
mer bank teller last night, "and gambling
! had no charms for me. I spent no more
money on women or life about the town
j than ether men In my position."
Where the money went is a cause of
much mental trouble to the attorneys for
the bank. They have searched the rec
ords and found no property In Borlinl's
name. They have, with the assistance
! of detectives, gone over the young man's
pathway for the last year without dis- j
covering a trace of excessive expendi
* tures. Borlinl has been dabbling In stocks,
only lightly, he avers, but the detoctives
pay that he admits this is the means by
which hÂ« hoped to retrieve his losses and â 
i cover his peculations on the bank.
Had Borlini returned a few days be- i
fore the time at which he wa* due at
An Excellent Combination.
< The pleasant method and beneficial
effects of the well known remedy,

Fretwell of the American Bank and
Trust Company Bald yesterday:
"The matter is out of our hands and
we will act in consonance with the Amer
ican Surety Company, Joining them In
prosecution if they advise It."
James R. Garnlss of the surety com
pany is not much- pleased with the at
titude of the bank.
'It Is for Mr. Fretwell to act." said
he yesterday afternoon. "The bank has
sustained the loss and they are the suf
ferers. If a settlement Is made by them,
why we have nothing to do with it. We
are ready to pay the $5000 which the bond
calls for whenever regular notice Is given
of the defalcation. I. for one, am not In
favor of prosecuting this young man.
Think of his wife; this poor. innocent,
lovely girl, and the pain and suffering
that will be forced upon her. No, sir,
I'll be if I will prosecute him." With
this ejaculation Mr. Garnlss' fist came
down upon his desk with destructive force
and he referred the settlement to the peo
ple of the bank.
When told what Garniss had said In
regard to a prosecution President Fret
well escaped with a mention of the name
of the bank's attorney, R. T. Harding.
"A settlement has been suggested by
Mr. Costello. Borlini's attorney, said At
torney Harding, "but It Is too small to
even consider it. The bank officials are
much Incensed over this defalcation and
are determined to force the matter to th â¢
end. As yet no offer has been' made which
will be accepted. I have been told that
Borlini might have received the financial
succor of many friends had it not been
for his recent marriage with the shadow
of a defalcation hanging over him. No,
I think the most stringent methods will
be pursued and Mr. Borlini may have to
meet a criminal trial."
By those who are directing the move
ment of things it is Rbserted that all ac

of the surety company is heard from. In

pleasures cf rustic life; all around Mm
he found this same conception, expressed
In manifold literary forma. In drama,
in romance. in lyric. This very play of
"As You Like It" Is founded on a pas
toral romance by Lodge, -called "Rosa
lynde." An abundant pastoral literature
began to nourish in the sixteenth cen- i
tury, when the Instinct for frolic was :
strong In the young nation and joy of
life was keen; It continued till the century
of Pope, when it died out in pure Ins'p
ldlty, subdued to tediousness by a formal
period which forced a code of narrow
proprieties even on shepherd's pranks.
Many a reader still loves to exchange
quips with Rosalind or to watch exquisite
Perdlta of the "Winter's Tale" among
her iwen and her sheep; few know this
wider world of pastoralâ a world less
wonderful, perhaps, than that of the
great Master, yet full of fragrant charm
and of melodious laughter. This ignorance
seems a pity; for we have In the serious
literature of the Anglo-Saxon race little
enough which expresses, like these pes
torals. pure ecstacy of Joyous grace. We
do not write pastorals any longer; per
haps we shall never write them again. We
point out, with Hardy or Hamltn Gar
land, the grim reality of the lives of the
toiling poor; we study agricultural condi
tions. The singing shepherd of old Greece
and Morrie England, with his gay gar
ments. Is replaced by Millet's "Man With ,
the Hoe," from whose soul no music
rises. All the more reason, rerhaps, why !
we should not forget this walled gar:, i.
of delights which our poet fathers plant
fed for our Joy.
Perhaps the most beautiful pastoral !
dramas In English, out of Shakespeare, '
are Peole's "Arraignment of Parts. ' act- I
ed at court by the children of the Queen's
chapel, probably In 1581; Ben Jonson's I
"Sad Shepherd." left unfinished at the '
poet's death, and Fletcher's enchanting !
lyrical drama, "The Faithful Shepherd- !
ess written about 160 S. The most mem- I
orable pastoral romance Is Sir Philip Sid- '
ney's "Arcadia." a wonderful piece of j
poetic prose, full of heroic Ideals and j
lovely pictures. As for the lyrics, they
bubble up all through the Elizabethan
country, clearest little fonts of sparkling
beauty:

Phlllt'laâ Here are cherries ripe, my Corydon;
Eat them for my sake.
Corydonâ Here's myoaten pipe, my lovely one,
Sport for thee to make.
Phlllldaâ Here are threads, my true love flnÂ«

Corydon- Poubt me not. my true love; do not
fear:
Farewell then, farewell then:
Heaven . keep our loves alway.
Corydon has a Greek name, and he and
Phlllida recall the origin of the pastoral
In the ancient days when Theocritus
watched his shepherds by the blue Si
cilian seas. Traces of classic tradition, of
brighter skies and fairer- landscapes than
those of the northlands pervade our pas
torals from first to last. Through France,
through Italy, through Spain, moreover,
the dainty pastoral spirit has passed be
fore he came to England, and distinc
tive melodies from all these lands blend I
In the music of his oaten pipes. He is |
thus no simple hind when he comes to ;
sojourn In the bright Elizabethan court.
Every now and then, indeed, as In the
work of Breton and Campion, the English
pastorals have pretty touches of local
color:
Jack and Joan they think no 111.
But loving live, and merry still;
Do their weekdays' work and pray
Devoutly on the holy day.
Tib Is all the father* joy.
And little Tom the mother's boy;
All their pleasure It content.
And care, to pay their yearly rent.
But. on the whole. It in not England
that we see; It Is a land of fantasy, where
daisies without surprise find themselves
blossoming beside Â«trange flowers from
the world of the past, and Dlggon hob
nobs* cheerfully with Damoetos. The real
life of the country, In all these pastorals,
Is looked at from very far away. The
lads and lassies spend their time In sing
ing to their sheep, not in pasturing them.
and even the silliest lambs would not be
so Inconsiderate as to stay away wbllo
love-making was In progress.
Often, as In the sixth book of the
"Faerie Queene" and the "Arcadia," the
shepherds are but knights and prince* in
disguise, and even when supposed to bo
of rustic birth they have [earned their
manners at court. ' Certainly they Â»eem
all the prettier, these manners, when dls
gulxed under a coat of humtipun or a
klrtle of â¢ green; yet every row and then
the modern reader rubs his eye* and a*U3

why he tolerates to linger In this artirlclal
and rantastic land. The reason la tha

and the old duke return, one feels, with
some reluctance, to the care* of an actual
realm. For here wo may enjoy a world of
exquisite breeding without formalltlea. lbÂ«
fruits of civilization without its pains.
Who would not sacrifice much. If ho
might, to reach this Impossible region? No
wonder strikes us when, as often happen*.
In the "Faithful Shepherdess"' or the "Ar
raignment of Paris." or elsewhere,
nymphs and satyrs, or even the Olympian
gods themselves, leave their glories to
join the shepherds' dance and play.
Yet. lovely as was this pastoral realm,
men turned away from It. They took to
reeling the pathos and beauty of real
shepherd life, as Wordsworth tells us In
'â¢The Prelude." and describing it for v*.
as he does In that noble and simple poem,
his "Michael." By and by they took to
writing realistic novels. And even to-day,
when we turn to the pastorals for relief
and escape, amunr all pastoral writer*
we count Shakespeare as the dearest ami
highest. For lie gave us pure poetry and
perfect grace, and the ecstasy of simplici
ty and of freedom: but through all this
gay loveliness of life disguised, he showed
us life Itself.

In the Elizhethan age pastorallsm en

all kinds of suc

strange, then. that
Shakespeare should
have tried his hand
at this form of
popular literature.

roles that It was
bound to succeed la
one. But, to speak
correctly, pastoral-
Ism was not a liter
ary form; It was a
poetical mode.
Whether In verse or
prose. It adopted a
form which should
be described by tho
usual literary no
menclature as dra-
matlcal, lyrical, *>!â¢â¢
. glacal or romantlc.il. With it Spenser
j portrayed the bucolic scenes of his "Shep

; and courtly "Arcadia." Lodge his rustic
; and romantic story of Rosalind. Lyly hU

Admirably did the pastoral lend itself
to the drama. ; Was It not a dramatic
thing to &Â«â¢â â¢ a princess tripping in shep-
I herdesq, attire along the sunny itlope of
: the hillside or In the gloom of the forest?
, Could anything be more entertaining than
to hear the gallant courtier discuss in
euphuistlc fashion the merits of pastoral
life or rural liberty? Amid such a setting
the most compromising situations, thÂ«Â»
most treasonable speeches became harm
less Innocence In the dramatist's creation.
, To him It wad the liberty of tho preÂ».-<;
to his audience It was the familiar ami
pleasing allegory combining realljzn an-l
Idealism. To the- average Ellzbcthuu
rallsra was, moreover, â  mode of
naturalism.
I Pastorallsm being essentially dramatic,
the drama made use of It from the very
earliest times. The miracle* and mys
teries sometimes represented Cain as a
typical boorish shepherd, and later m
moralities and Interludes never refusÂ«tj
the valuable aid of pastorallsm. The un
dent myth of Robin Hood and his Jolly
outlaws, under the greenwood tree ol
Sherwood forest, entered Into many a
dramatic production and lent a truo fclne
i lish aspect to the exotic tendencies of tho
â¢ renaissance pustorals. Lyly and Greeno
| both admitted pastoral scenes Into their
! dramas, the former depleting a pscurto

while the latter gives Bturtlln*ly vivid
pictures of real English country life. Both

called social world. Jaques had sought
i the sequestration of the forest to nurs<Â»

weep and to cherish his scorn of the out

, found room for sad humor, for his bitter
observations; in spite of his peaceful sur
roundings his heart Â»aÂ» eaten with mel
ancholy and he railed "against our mis
tress, the world, and oil our misery." To
all the others Arden was a place or refugo
from a world of misery, but for Jaques
It was an observatory from which he
loved to watch tho misery of the world;
to the. others Arden was a hospital where
their sorrows were being healed, to Jaques
It was a dissecting room where ho could
hold an autopsy on his own heart. Ar

Boston Wool Market.
nopTON. Dec. 27 âThe American Wool and
. Reporter will say to-morrow:
The past week. Interrupted as It has been
by the holidays, has been naturally a very
quiet one In the wool trade. Prices are steady
and there are no weak spot* to he found as
far a* a very careful canvass of the situation '
reveals. The few wale* which have Iwen made |
have been generally at full prices. The trade
anticipate a high range of values for next
year, a* may be Indicated by the fact that
attempts are being made In several sections of
the West to contract for WOOI on the sheep's
back. Indications are that the entire .lip
for the year will be contracted for at an earlier
date than ever before. The nales of the week
in Boston amounted to 2.070.000 pounds domestic
and 250.000 pounds foreign, making a total of
2.350.00). against a total of 3.36^.Ofiti for the
previous year and a total of 3.795.000 for the
corresponding week last year. Sale* since Jan
uary 1. 1599. amount to 347.155.776 pounds,
against 141.132,510 pounds last year at this time.
Review of the Wool Market for the
Year.
BOSTON, Dec. 27â The American Cotton and
Wool }:â¢â¢!> rter will publish to-morrow Its an
nual review of the wool market. It estimates
the total supply of wool in the United States
at the. "lose of the year, exclusive of manu
facturers' holdings, at 1T,7,3:'5.57Â» pounds,
against 3.^9.033.553 a year ago. Of this amount
Boston has 113.743 pounds, against 136.055.213
pounds a year ago. including wool in bond.
Exclusive of wool In bond Boston has an avail
able supply of 4L557.900 pounds, against 102,
010,179 last year. New York's total' available
supply is 25.200.055. against 42,074.451 pound*
last rear, Philadelphia has U.MI.IU against
24.384.650.
The total stock* in the three princlDal mar
kets cf the United States are 113, 2?5. 579 pounds,
agnlnst 2'>4,195,252 pounds a year aco.
The sales of wool In Boston during the year
have been 347.155.776 pounds, against 141.132.510
pounds In IS9S. Bales In the three principal
markets of it." United State* have amounted
to 514.947,920 pounds, against 230.45G,3!>5 pounds
last year.
The total wool clip of th* country' is placed
at Slightly less than 275.000.000 pound*, against
about â  0.000 last year. At the beginning
of the year the total available supply of the
country Â»'v about 340.OO0.O0") pounds. Impor
tations have beer, exceptionally small, those
at Boston being only 34.372.341 pounds, against
40.H23.043 last year The result Is that owing
to the phenomenally large demand for wool for
consumption, which has swept through all the
principal wool centers of the country, the total
available stock on hand at the close of th.
year has been reduced to a comparatively low'
point.
By far the greater portion of the wool this
year is now at the seaboard market*. A year
ago the supply was pretty evenly divided be
tween the Interior and the seaboard.
As the year closes the Mutation Is a strong
one. No relief practically has been obtained
from abroad. There is n scarcity of fine wools
th* world over, foreign markets have been
advancing by leaps and bounds, the Australian
clip, which again show* a material reduction,
has been eagerly bought by anxious users of
wool, the london markets have staadllv ad
vanced and tops on the Continent have risen
beyond all expectation. Foreign buyers have
been so anxious to secure supplies that they
have, taken a lame portion of the fine Aus
tralians, which had been here In bond, and
the beginning of the year 1900 witnesses a very
limited supply of foreign clothing wools here.
to draw upon.
While the present demand for wool Is not
as pronounced as It wan a few months aio
great expectations are entertained regarding
thÂ« heavy-weight season, which I* now about
to open. Stocks on hand are not excessive. The
Roods must be made to supply the demand, and
this mean* a large consumption of wool.

PROPERTY CLERK MORAN
ASKS TO BE PENSIONED
CAPTAIN JAMES MORAN has u-skcd the Police Commissioners to re
tire him on & pension. Last night his request was discussed, but at
the suggestion of Commissioner Tobin, chairman of the board, action
was .postponed until next Tuesday, when the Commissioners meet as a
pension board.
The news that- Captain Moran had asked to be retired was received with
regret by every member of the department. Always affable and courteous,
he has not only endeared himself to Chief Lees and the Commissioners, but
to the entire force. He was appointed a member of the department on May
1, IÂ£7S, and on account of his cleverness and strict attention to -business he
was soon afterward made a sergeant. On the deMh of Property Clerk Cullen
In July, I?9S,- Koran was appointed his .successor with the rank of captain.
During the Sutter-street railroad strike in ISS M run. who was then a
patrolman, sustained a severe injury to his leg. from" which he is still suffer
ing. Owing to his condition and anxious to take a well-deserved rest, Moran
has asked to be placed on the pension list.
It Is said that several other members of the department will be retired
next Tuesday along with Moran-
lascinauon. Her songs are positively '
chaste, she seemingly having discarded i
the chansons chocking that she brought I
to this country with her six. seven year*
ago. She has also laid aside the pyra- .
mids of millinery she \rus wont to wear,
and I looked in vain for the two inches
of Fougere that used once to appear at
the top of hÂ«r stocking, and which scan
dalized New York. She uses her voice
in an orthodox French style and her arat

that it !s qu'.te Impossible to say exactly
what the author of the song meant when

CLUB WOMEN
MEET TO FORM
A FEDERATION
Steps Toward a State
Organization.
Oakland Office Ban Francisco CaJl.
90S .Broadway/ Doc, 27.
A mating of club women was held la
the parlors of thÂ« Unitarian Church this
afternoon, at which were representatives
of â M of the best-known organizations
in the State. The meeting was called by
Mrs. Ella M. Sexton, who holds an im
portant place in both a club and a liter
ary way. and was for the purpose of dis
cussing the federation of all the clubs of
California. About lirty ladles were pres
ent.
The gathering was an Interesting one.
It brought together workers In the suf
frage movement; philanthropic ladles who
favor federation as a more powerful
means for good; conservative ones who.
are willing to see clubs In general Join
if their own takM no part In the Ques
tion, and others who were utterly In Ig
norance on the whole subject and said
so. There were a -number of bright
speeches that kept to the subject and
were enjoyable.
Mrs. Lloyd Baldwin presided and Miss
Soule of Alameda acted as secretary.
Mrs. Sexton gave, the most interesting
address of the afternoon, in which she
gave a few reasons for federation. She
said In part:
"That the Individual clubs of California
belonging to the General Federation of
Women's Clubs should unite In a State
organization appears to me most desir
able and feasible. To this association
should be welcomed also every woman*
club of the State.- and these, with the 4 >â¢
members of the twenty societies, already
enrolled in the General Federation, would
form a body of representative women able
to inaugurate a system of work upon the
broadest lines and for the general good
of the State as a whole. The system of
education In California, for Instance, with
ii view to better sanitation and Improve
ment of country schools, the establish
ment of free kindergartens, of traveling
libraries or library .extension, of free text
books, the formation of town and village
Improvement and beautifying societies, an
investigation of the working conditions of
women and children throughout the State
and plans for the betterment of such
wage-workers, the Vtudy of domestic
science. Any one of these subjects taken
up by a State federation of strong, calm,
yet enthusiastic club women promises
jwondrous possibilities of good."
Mrs. Sexton advocated the Interest of
club women in the educational systems
of ail public Institutions for abandoned,
defective or delinquent children.
Mrs. Emma Shafter Howard, who is a
forcible and brilliant speaker, advocated
federation strongly. Following her, Mrs.
John F. Swift declared that federation I?
on the way and will be carried In this
State.
"A largo number of clubs will unite."
she said, "and those that do not want to,
needn't. "
Mrs. A A. Dennlson spoke from the
point of one who had made a brief but
â¢thorough study of the subject. Mrs. Sims
of- Berkeley was also called upon.
Mrs. R. P. GleaÂ«on. president of Ebell
begged to be excused. She said that she
attended, not as a representative of her
club, but In a personal way and as one
whe was rot posted whatever on the sub
ject of federation.
At the clone of the meeting a resolu
tion favoring federation was adopted
without a dissenting voice, though there
was a feeling entertained by a few that
general federation was not entirely satis
factory to their minds Mrs. Sexton said
that the afternoon hud been an encour
aging one and that she was pleased with
the results, which showed a strong senti
ment In favor of the uniting of all the
clubÂ« of the State. .

BOLD WORK OF
AN INCENDIARY
IN OAKLAND
â . â¢
Attempts to Destroy a
Hotel.
Oakland Office San Franrigoo Call.
908 Broadway. Dec. 27.
A disastrous fire, which would In all
probability have resulted in the loss of
a block of property and the lives of sev
eral people, was narrowly averted tWs
morning by the fortunate discovery by
Patrolman Andrews of the work of an
Incendiary at the northeast corner of
Seventh and Franklin streets. The in
cendiary had placed several Rations of
kerosene in Â«n unoccupied barroom on
the ground floor and in one of the sleep
in? rooms above, and had deliberately ap
plied a match to It. Luckily Patrolman
Andrews paw the blaze before it had
gained much headway, anil he summoned
the Fire Department In time la avert the
catastrophe.
Andrews was i at rowing his beat In the
vicinity of Seventh anil Broadway at 3
o'clock, wneti he noticed ih<- reflection of
the flame? in the windows of th? build
ing, the upper floor of which is used as
a lodging house by Mrs. Robert Flynn.
He hastily turned in an alarm and the
Fire Department responded promptly. It
took considerable fighting to extinguish
the blaze, but it was done before very
little of the woodwork had In-come Ig
nited.
As soon as the firemen arrived upon
the scene they realized that arson had
been attempted, and an investigation by
Fire Chief Hall and Police Sergeant Green
confirmed their belief. The barroom con
tained wads of paper and several blan
kets saturated with coal oil, and it nad
been liberally spread about the floor. A
tumbler containing the- fluid had been
placed on .the 'ark bar and on the bar
proper was a broken oil lamp. The bar
room has long been unoccupied, and It la
claimed that a door connecting it with a
corridor from the street was always left
open. Just above the barroom, on the
Franklin street side of the house, was the
other sleeping room which had been
treated to a coating of kerosene. Here
the oil had been generously sprinkled and
the bed clothing, consisting of a single
blanket and a spread, had also been sat*
urated. In one place the carpet had been
torn up and the oil poured through a re
cently bored hole to the ceiling of the
room below. Thin room, according to Mrs.
Flynn, was last used by an elderly man,
whose name she did not know. The man,
sha claimed, had the only key to the
room other than her general pass key.
She had known him but a short time and
could give no reason for the attempted
arson. as she claimed to have no ene
mies.
Had the flames gained any headway It
is doubtful whether the block bounded
by Seventh. Eighth. Franklin and Web
ster streets could have been saved. The
buildings are close together and are old
frame affairs, mostly occupied by Chi
nese. They were all well filled and it
would have been with difficulty that the
sleeping occupants could have been
warned in time to escape. The building
In which the fire was started Is owned by
the Belts estate, Mrs. "Flynn carried an
Insurance on her scanty furniture of 1700
in the Hartford Company, the officers of
which are assisting the police In their
efforts to detect the incendiary.
CALIFORNIA AT BUFFALO.
Preparing: for the Greatest Exhibit
California Has Ever Made.
The most gratifying news that haÂ» been
received recently at the State Board of
Trade came to the hands of the manager,
J. A. Pllcher, yesterday In the form of
a letter from Buffalo. N. Y. It contained
the information that (he board had been
granted free space In the Pan-American
Exposition, which will open In that city
in May. ls*)l. A long time ago It was un
derstood here that this fair would equal
in scope any that has ever been held on
this continent, and would be second only
to the World's Fair of Paris. The demand
nas been very great from the
etart and the State Board of Trade from
the beginning made a strong stand for
fre* space for the State exhibits of Cali
fornia. As tht space required for the
thousands of exhibits that will be sent
will require at least Jfi.'Â«X) Â»><juart feet,
there was some Ht>i>r<henslon that a re
fusal would be the answer.
Mr. Ftlcher states that but few people
of this State appreciate the magnitude
and importance of the Pan-American Ex
pobition and the i-ffect it will have upon
the future commercial relationship of the
American countries. For years the United
States has endeavored to secure the trade
of the countries of this hemisphere, but
found that the rival manufacturers of
Europe had the inside hold upon the busi
ness. This assembling of the commodities
of all American countries Is certain to
keep on this sfde of the water the trade
that should never have gone abroad.
Preparations are being made to have this
State turn out the best exhibit of its nat
urul and manufactured products that has
ever crossed the boundary.

DROWNS WITH
HELP AT HAND
Mysterious Tragedy at
Alameda Mole.
ALAMEDA. Dec 17 -The story of a
mysterious drowning that occurred at the
narrow-gauge mole on Saturday night has
beÂ«n reported to the Police Department
by some of the railroad employes. R.
Ohliierl, a car cleaner, and a gatekeeper
who Is known as "Gus " claim that an un
known man was drowned underneath the
wharf at about 11 o'clock on the night
mentioned. He was heard calling for help
and the two railroad men shouted back
that help was coming.
The gatekeeper got a boat as quickly as
possible and wen,t to the drowning man's
assistance, while Ghihert stayed on the
wharf and shouted words of encourage
ment. The cries of the drowning man
began to grow feebler, and before th-
gatekeeper reached the place from which
the sounds came they had entirely
ceased. He rowed about beneath the
*harf but could find no tram of the
unfortunate wan.
The railroad employes a K>nt the mole
did not notice any stranger upiund the
place during the night, and as no one
n.ta-lnR has beer, reported to the police
there is at present no iiÂ«-w to the man a
identity. It Is thought (msslhle that the
person drowned may have been a pas
senger on the 10:45 boat from San Fran
cisco.

DON JOSE PICO
PUTS TO ROUT
TWO BURGLARS
Fills One Full of Bird
shot.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway. Dec. 27.
Don Jose Ramon Pico, the oldest Na
tive Son in California and a descendant
of the old Pico family of early tipanish
days, had an exciting battle with two
burglars at his home In Temescal early
thÂ» moraine He shot one of the men,
as was proven by the blood that was
found in the yard after daylight, but
both got away.
It was somewhere In the neighborhood
of 3 o'clock that Major Pico was awak
ened by hearing some one trying to pick
the lock of his front door. He heard the
man at work with some iron instrument.
The major was not frightened by thÂ«
prospect of burglars and ho Spanish
blood was aroused and taking a shotgun
that he keeps always with him he made
a reconnoifibance in force against the in
vaders md found two men standing on
the porch that surrounds the old Pico
residence.
The disparity In numbers did not worry
the major or did he concern himself
with the 'act that several men have been
killed in Oakland while resisting burglars
and highwaymen. He made a flank
movement upon the attackl.fs forces. Ho
tired through a window. The man who
was working at the door uttered a cry
and jumped off the porch to the ground,
about seven feet below. His companion
drew a revolver and fired at random and
then he. too. fled from the sc*ne.
Having routed the enemy Major Pico
made an investigation and found marks
on the lock of the door where the men
had been working. He searched the yard,
but there way no trace of the men. This
morning he found blood in the yard,
showing that the man he shot at had
been hit.
'I would have killed the man," mid
Major Pico to-day In telling the story,
"if my sun had not been loaded with
fine birdshot. I saw him working at the
door and fired through the window ana
I found blood, showing that the man had
been shot."

Incident of the Trial of
Molineux.
Â»
DETECTIVES TOO ENERGETIC
>
FOREMAN MARTIN REGISTERS
A COMPLAINT.
c
Defense in the Murder Case Seeks to
Make Capital Out of the Re
ligious Views of Expert
Ames.
Ppeclal Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Dec. 27.â Two things of In
terest, If not of Importance, were devel
oped at the trial of Roland B. Mollneux
to-day. The first Incident was the pro
test made to Recorder Goff against the
policy of "shadowing" adopted by the
Dlbtrlct Attorney. The Jurors claim that
a detective ha_s been assigned to each
member and that the "shadows" had al
lowed their feal to outrun their discre
tion. One of the Jurors told the Recorder
that he had attended a Christmas tree
ii on Christmas night and that his
every movement about the tree, even the
Motions of his children, had been closely
watched. To have his every word and
his every ;u t scrutinized, the Juror Bald,
\\.is a vexation that was rapidly becoming
Intolerable.
Foreman Martin, who was one of the
complaining juror.*, seemed to think that
the entire range of the domestic and busl
. oonomy of the Jurors had been
made the subject of a close scrutiny by
the ambitious detectives. It is said that
Recorder Ooff told the Jurors he could do
nothing for them, and that they went
HWHj-. anything but well pleased with the
situation.
-tant District Attorney Mclntyre, I
in explaining the actions of the District
Attorney's office, e.ld that fifteen detec
tives hud been selected to watch the
members of the Jury. He said that it wag
the cuatom to employ men to "shadow"
jurors duriiit; un important murder case,
and that ttiu precautionary action thua
t:iken was in the Interest of justice and
the public good. It id understood, how
ever, that Ofttan will be issued to the
"shadows' to give the Jurors as little
tr..u. -ible in the future.
The oth^r incident of interest occurred
during tho cross-examination of Hand
writlng lOxpert Ames of San Francisco.
Who is the author of a houk on "Biblical
Myths." Mr. Weeks inquired whether the
â  had ever written this sentence:
"Again, isnorunce and fear tremble and
are prostrated before self-seeking cunning
and fraud, according to the firm of Moses,
Jehovah Ac Co., unlimited, re-established;
articles of copartnership perpetual; pow
ers omnipotent, capital Inllnite; realms
terrestrial and celestial, and Moses Its
general financier."
At this point Assistant District Attor
ney O>borne objected emphatically to the
introduction of these writings of Expert
Ames for the purpose of prejudicing the
Jury. After a lively battle of words for
a few moments the Recorder called Mr.
Weeks to order and ruled that the law
allowed no religious testimony of a wit
_*d tint an affirmation did not
irily embrace a declaration of
In <Jod. During the recess Clerk of
the Court Brophy explained that Expert
Ames had merely affirmed when taking
the stand; that he had not u*ed the words
"So help me Ood."
The day was largely devoted to techni
al â¢â x.'imlnations of handwriting Experts
Tyrrell and Anits. Nothing new or im
portant was developed.
The trial, which U now In Its forty
fourth day, has broken the record for
murde r trials In New York County by one
day, with the prosecution apparently not
having half finished Its Fide of th* oa*Â»Â».
li Is understood that the State will Intro
duce ver* little. If any, additional expert
handwriting evidence, and that expert
tnciiical wlincssoÃ will soon be called to
and for tho purpose of proving the
i..(]y of the crime and showing that Mrs.
Adams really died as a result of the ad
ministration of the contents of the mail
package.

la crder that the people may fairly
comprehend the situation It Is necessary
to recall torn* of the Incidents preceding
the creation cf the Committee of One
Hundred. Judge Magulre in May, 1888,
was a candidate for gubernatorial hon
ors and wanted harmony. Governor
Budd and Major Harney were anxious to
obtain control of the DÂ«Â»mocratlo works
and bring about a reconciliation of all the
warring element*. The same purpose
animated Mayer Phelan and Gavin Me-
Nab. As all the leading statesmen were
yearning for harmony, the main purpose,
therefore, was to devise some means to
promote peace.
The plan for the State Central Commit
tee to naino nine peacemakers was sub
mitted. Governor lJudd and Major Har
ney looked over the Hold and came to the
conclusion that they cuulii control five of
the nlnÂ« sui?p<Â»stÂ«Ni. Ga\in McNab fan
cied thai he could win ovÂ«r five and thus

the conquest of the works by the Phelan-

Of course the obligation to make Alford
attorney for the Harbor Commission was
canceled. Gavin McNab. however, ar
ranged that Eugene Deuprey should be
District Attorney of San Francisco and
Alford should have a $3500 place In the
office. The plan miscarried because the
Hearst Influence in the Examiner office
compelled the sacrifice of Deuprey and
I the nomination of Barclay Henley for
1 District Attorney. In order to console
Deuprey It was agreed that he should
1 have the District Attomey6hlp In 1899.
Owing to the strength developed last fall
by other candidate*, and particularly by
Wesley Reed. Potter Ashe and L* F.
Byington. Deuprey had no chance In the
i convention. He withdrew from the race
I after a long conference with Charles Fay.
It Is surmised that he was promised a
â  first-class position In the District Attor
ney* office, but when the promise was
given It was supposed by Fay that Reed
would win the nomination. Bylngton
really broke the slate and compelled Mo-
Nab's acceptance of the situation in order
to defeat Porter Ashe's nomination.
Bylngton was elected and now the pro
gramme to reward Alford and Deuprey
Is presented to him. He threatens to Kick
over the traces and appoint Greaney and
Weller. For many years Bylngton and
"Weller were associated In the law busi
ness, hence personal regard and old-time
friendship are considered by the District
Attorney-elect. Greany was a staunch
supporter of Byington throughout the
political campaign last fall and is classed
as foremost among those entitled to
recognition.
There Is not much sympathy expressed
for Alford. ai> he deserted Budd and Har
ney to Join Phelan and McNab.

TAKEN TO TEXAS
His Parents Appear
in Cook's Court.
BOY IN SHERIFFS CUSTODY
EFFORTS BEING MADE TO
EFFECT A COMPROMISE.
Disposition of Litigation Between
the Prominent New Orleans
People Near at
Hand,
The first scene In what promise* tÂ© be
a sensational legal battle for the custody
of young Richard Dabney Johnson was
l enacted by parents and counsel In Judge
Cook's court yesterday morning. The
child, who Is Just past 12 years of age.
Is the coveted treasure of his parents,
Albert Sidney Johnson and his wife, but
j as they have separated there will be con
siderable trouble before his custody Is
finally awarded by the court. Late Tues
day afternoon Deputy Sheriff D. C. Mar
tin went to the Ocoidental Hotel In obedi
| ence of process of court and took the
lad from the custody -of his mother. Mrs.
Johnson followed them to the Palace
Hotel and took apartments adjoining
those In which the son retired, and In or
der to see that the lad did not change his
residence the deputy and Mr. Johnson
remained up all night and kept guard.
Yesterday morning a writ of habeas
corpus sworn out by Mr. Johnson In an
effort to secure the custody of his boy
was called by Judge Cook for hearing 7
Mother, father and child were In court at
the hour set for the hearing. Milton Eis
ner represented the father, who filed the
writ, and General Barnes appeared to
prosecute the Interests of the mother.
Mrs. Johnson, richly gowned and with
an Intelligent, expressive face: Mr John
son, tall and refined, and the lad. bright
well groomed and bejeweled. took their
respective seats and the fight was on.
General Barnes rose and said that he
was not ready to proceed with the merits
of the case. The contest over the child's
tÂ°â¢Â£ dy Â£, th * J* 1 " 11 of matrimonial
troubles between his parents and it does
not seem oroper that he should remain In
iii e tw Bl( * y Â». of the Â« herl! L I" k that un
til this matter Is disposed of the boy bs
given Into his mother's custody. We will
give a bond for his appearance In court
this afternoon. 7T" * fc
Mr. Eisner objected to this proceeding
and said that no harm could result If thÂ«
boy remained in the Sheriff's custody for
a few hours and his client, the boy's
father, would be better pleased If this
course was followed as the lad might be
Influenced In'iome way prejudicial to his
fa.her. This Mrs. Johnson promptly de
nied, but the oourt refused to disturb the
right of the Sheriff and the boy remained
In his custody. At % o'clock In the after
noon the litigants were again In court and
Mr. Eisner made a motion for a continu
ance. General Barnes said that he had
no objection as a compromise would
doubtless be effected before this morning
and possibly me lad would be sent to
Texas In charge of relatives.
The case will again come up for hearing
this morning and In the meantime Mr
a ?li Mrs. Johnson, who occupy an en
viable position in New Orleans society
will prepare their points In event the
compromise falls through and the court
Is left to determine the merits of the
parents" contentions.
When court adjourned the attorneys
Mrr^d to hold a meeting this morning "in
the hope of arriving at an amicable *et
tienient. It Is understood that nÂ»lth*r
parent will allow the child to remain In

TO PUMP FROM THE DEPTHS
MILLIONS OF LONG-BURIED GOLD
The Latest California Gold-Digging Invention.
Cmltfomf* tmln Â»tcpÂ« to the front in
the rapid march of the mining Industry
with a fold getting Invention that prom
ises to effect a revolution in one depart
ment of the great mining field.
An lnrentlve C allfornla miner has per
fected a method of dipsrlng gold chiefly
with air and water. The process, as It
haa been developed up on the old Mokel
umne. Is a thoroughly practical one and Is
now an economical success. If It remains
a success under varying oondltlons, as It
promises to do. millions of dollars' worth
of California gold, not obtainable In any
other way. will be added to the gold pro
duct of the State, and the phenomenal
but now Inaccessible riches of the stream
beds of the Cape Nome. Cape York and
other gold regions will be won.
P. B. Donahoo Is the man who appears
to have solved the gold mining problem
never Bolved before. The problem Is that
of how to get the gold lying on and In the
crevices and depressions of the bedrock
under the channels of auriferous streams
when the bedrock must remain sub
merged. The problem stuck In Mr. Dona
hoo's mind during many years of his long
mining career In California and other
western States and two or three years
ago he began practical experiments which
led to Its solution. His novel solution Is
a big floating plant provided with power
and machinery, the chief feature being a
large caisson, kept clear of water by air
pressure In the usual way, which can be
rapidly sunk through a deep bed of gravel,
which Is sluiced as excavated to the bared
bedrock, which can be quickly and thor
oughly cleaned. In all gold bearing
streams the placer gold Is naturally most
concentrated on the bedrock Itself. Of
California's gold product of $1,800,000,000
about $1*000,000,000 has been placer gold.

energies to ascertaining Its hiding place
and with the aid of detectives kidnaped

a climax by securing a writ of habeas

FALSE CLAIM OF NEW
STRENGTH FOR BURNS
LETTER FROM ASSEMBLYMAN
COWAN OP SONOMA.
His Position as a Democrat Defined
and His Purpose to Stand by His
Party Declared.
AseemNymnn William V. Cowan of So
noma expresses surprise that he 1b In
cluded In a list of twenty-one members
of the legislature, of which number fif
teen are classed as new recruits In the
camp of D. M. Burns.
The Call published the statement that
agents of the Southern Paclflo were
claiming that Burns had gained fifteen
votes slnoe the adjournment of the regu
lar session. It was aleo noted that the
agents of the corporntion when called
upon to designate the fifteen exhibited a
list of twenty-one, claiming that the fif
teen recruits were there enrolled.
Assemblyman Cowan, a Democrat, was
embraced In the larger list. The Call's
motive In giving publicity to the list was
to show the utter absurdity of the rail
road's claim of Increased strength for
Burns and also to elicit expressions from
members of the Legislature who had no
thought of entering the Burns corral.
The purpose of the publication has been
served. Mr. Cowan clearly defines his
position in this language:
It must bÂ« known to The Call that I am
a Democrat and supported none but Demo
crats for BrnatortsJ honors during; the last
session of the Legislature, and did not have,
and will not. have, the "open sesame" to
the majority caucus. Furthermore, there
has been no cogent reason tug Rested to alter
my determination In regard to the Senator
ial question, and, as In the past I did. In
the future I will. eonÂ«l<Jer It my duty to
support a Democrat of known probity and
ways at the bottoms of bars and benches,
where the stream had onoe deposited Its
gold and left It on finding a different and
lower channel. The present channels were
rich and the greatest values lay, as a rule.
In the lowest parts where they were least
accessible. Millions have been spent In
getting at these gold reserves by taking
the stream out of Its bed, where Us size
made It possible and In building wing
dams around small areas of river beds
during low water, the enclosed Bpace be
ing pumped out and worked. Millions
have been recovered In this way, but only
a small fraction of the beds of the present
streams have been worked In this man
ner and under all these waters, as they
now run all through the gold regions
there Is more gold than there was In 1849.
How to get this gold has been the hard
est problem miners have met. It Is eas
ier to get gold buried a half-mile deep In
the veins of a mountain. The drift mln- i
ers are getting out the millions of placer ,
gold on the bedrock of ancient rivers ,
buried under hundreds of feet of lava,
but they are getting little of the gold In
the beds of the present California rivers.
Diverting or wing damming a stream
is costly and hazardous. The need has
been partly met with gold dredges. In
which powerful buckets, armed with big
steel teeth, bring up the gravel. But
these dredges, of whatever type, have
solved the problem only partly, stopping
Just above the bedrock. The huge steel
scoops can't pick up the gold lying right I
on the bottom. Most stream beds con- I
tain "potholes" and other depressions In I
which the gold often concentrates and
the story of California mining Is full of
tales of lucky fortunes found in such
treasure places. The dredges let such gold
lie. The bedrock is generally full of
cracks and crevices, and theae the heav-
ability for th* offlc* of United Btatta Sen
ator; and no action or conduct on my part
has licensed any on* to Infer that I will
devlata from such course. A high regard
for aad a sense of duty to the party of which
I am a representative In the Legislature
dictate that In the selection of a United
Gtatee Senator I should ba guided by thÂ«
counsel tuid wish of that political party, and
to this principle I shall not be recreant.
IWllzlng that It Is your desire to ascer
tain the truth on this subject, I Indite thes*
few lrnes. that the readers oi your vsJuabl*
paper may not be deceived by an unwar
ranted statement as to my attitude.

drift mines several Inches of the bed
rock are generally taken up, and this Is
the practice In the Klondike. So plain
Is this that a soft bedrock which a dredge
can easily dig up is recognized as essen
tial to full success In dredging. That Is
why dredging is so successful in the
Clutha. in New Zealand. The bedrock on
the Feather, near Orovllle, Is a soft lava
deposit, and that is why OrovJlle is the
dredging center of the State. Elsewhere
the dredge must take the top and leave
the richest concentrates which nature has
hidden with greatest success.
This la the significance of Mr. Dona
hoo'n submarine hydraulic dredge. He Is
the first to succeed In adapting the cais
son to gold mining. The big chamber of
iron plates, easily raised and lowered
from a barge, sinks to the river bottom,
an air compressor keeping out the water.
A powerful centrifugal pump leading
from the bottom rapidly excavates by
euctlon and passes upward the river bed
and the chamber goes steadily downward.
The material. Including all bowlders that
will enter the pipe, goes to a revolving
grizzly on the Darge, from which the finer
material passes to 160 feet of sluices in
which the gold Is caught. To facilitate
the excavation, which Is on the principle
of the dredge* so successful on canal
work, a force pump supplies when wanted
a powerful stream, which is used from
a nozzle at the bottom like a hydraulic
giant, digging up the bottom and passing
the material to the suction pump.
The plant has worked for two months
In the bed of the Mokelumne. thirty miles
above Stockton, and Is now running night
and day. It Is reported that the opera
tions have been so successful that dur
ing the coming year four large plants of
this type are to be Installed on that and
adjoining streams, which have been for
ages wearing away the great mother lode
and which hold In their lowest depths the
gold that was there when Marshall found
his nugget Â«. The Invention Is interesting
and full of possibilities, for Its estab
lished success would mean great things
to the State.

HIGHBINDERS IN
CHINATOWN ARE
READY FOR WAR
Outbreak Expected at
Any Moment.
*
TEN EXTRA POLICE ON DUTY
â¢
MABYSVTLLE MURDER HAS
HASTENED MATTERS.
â  â¦
Hop Slug and Suey Sing Tongs,
Rival Factions, Waiting for a
Chance to Open Hos
tilities.
ThÂ« war between the Hop Sing and Suey
Blng tonjjs which has been brewing for
some time past has reached a point where
a wholesale murder is feared by the law
abldlns and peaceable Chinese of this
city. The police have Kept the rival fac
tions under close surveillance for some
time, and it was thought that the high
binders had transferred their hostllluea
to the interior counties of the State.
The warring tongs, however, have been
trying to rally their lighters to this city
and for several days the Chinatown
squad has been picking up stray high
binders recently arrived from the coun
try and ordering them to leave the city
under peialty.
The presence of the notorious flghter
who hires out as a professional murderer
has been noted by the merchants, and In
consequence notices have been posted in
the Chinese quarter appealing to Its deni
zens to avoid trouble. On Tuesday lust
a member of the Suey Sing Company was
killed in Marysville in a pitched battle
among the factions, where over a hun
dred shois were fired, and at once a Hop
Sing member was charged with the crime.
The accused man is a notorious Los
Angeles highbinder and was .sent to
Marysvllle, the Suey Sings claim, under
a contract to kill ono of their men.
When the news of the murder reached
San Frunclsco the resident members of
the fighting societies commenced gather
ing In their respective 1. ra to
determine how tv start hostilities here.
The police were notified early yesterday
that an outbreak might b* expected at
any moment, and in cun.Â«equence a squad
of ten officers under command of Sergeant
Christiansen has been t.Jded to the detail
already In Chinatown, with orders to
break up meetings of the bad plement and
to search every suspicious character
Last night the extra sÂ«juad went Into
Cum Cook alley and fuuna ovrr one hun
dred excited Chinamen and drove them
from the vicinity. There la no doubt that
the timely arrival of the squad prevented
the opening of hostilities, for soon after
the men came back to the alley In twos
and threes to renew their meeting. Ser
geant Chrlstlan6en. however, had his men
DM some force and search every susr
plclous or known "bad man." giving or
ders to his men to keep them moving and
allow no gatherings on the streets. The
early precautions may have a good effect
on the Chinamen, but trouble la feared
and the report from one pistol Is liable
to start a fusillade that will make work
for the Coroner.
BARBER SHOP ROBBED.
Thieves GÂ«t Away With Money and
a Number of Razors.
Burglars plundered the barber shop In
the basement of 16 Powell street Tuesday
night and secured about $15 In cash and
a number of razors. The thieves made
their entrance into the place througn a
rear doorway leading into an all'
running off 10111b street. From the man
ner In which the burulars worked the
proprietor believes that they were famil
iar with the place. The money was fiiil
den behind one of the mirrors.
