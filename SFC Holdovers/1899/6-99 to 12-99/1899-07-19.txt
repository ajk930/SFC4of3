CHICAGO, July 18.â Brigadier Gen
eral Thomas M. Anderson, com
manding the Department of the
Lakes, according to advices that
reached here to-night, is to be re
stored to the rank of Major General of
Volunteers and placed in command of
the army in the Philippines. The re
call of General Otis and the appoint
ment of General Anderson in his stead
will occur within the next week. This
Information comes from a private but
reliable source.
The choice of < new commander to
succeed General Otis is said to lie be
tween Generals Merritt and Anderson.
General Merritt has first claim to the
appointment, but he was recently mar
ried and does not wish to leave his com
fortable home in New York for fresh
service in the islands. On the other
hand. General Anderson, who led the
first expedition sent to aid Dewey, is
anxious to return there, and so he has
been selected for the command.
â¢When interviewed to-night General
Anderson denied that he had any offi
cial notification that he had* been se
lected.
"I have heard it in a grape-vine
way," said he, "but I have no official
intimation that it is true, and I place
no credence in the rumor whatever.
"One reason why I would not be sent
to the Philippines is because I am too
rem- the age of retirement. I will re- I
tire next February, and the Govern
ment would hardly send me abroad
â with that date so near."
General Anderson left the city to
night for Camp Thomas, where he will
pee to the recruiting of the Thirty-first
Infantry.
DISAGREEMENT OF
ANDERSON AND OTIS
Subordinate General Confirms tbe
Beports of a Clash at
Manila.
NEW YORK, July 18.â A Chicago
special to the Herald says: General
Thomas M. Anderson, commander of
the Department of the Lakes, confirms
the newspaper statements about his
clash with General Otis ln the Phil
ippines.
It was stated that even before the
first insurgent attack on the American
troops on February 4, Aguinaldo threw
up strong earthworks in sight of Gen
eral Anderson's lines. The latter 'in
sisted that his troops were being en
dangered and asked General Otis for
permission to stop the Filipinos' opera
tions. Then the following colloquy is
reported to have occurred:
"We will do nothing," said General
Otis, "until the Filipinos commit some
act of war."
"But they are intrenching themselves
against us." replied General Anderson,
"and the moment a man puts a spade
into the ground with hostile Intent he j
has committed an act of war."
Commenting on this reported con
versation General Anderson said to
day:
"That is a true statement of matters
that are now of record in the War De
partment at Washington, but it is in
formation which was never given out
by me. Aside from what the facts re
corded In my report may show, I have
no comment or criticism to advance in
regard to General Otis' acts as com

DREYFUS COURT-MARTIAL
WILL MEET IN AUGUST
Esterhazy Says He Was Ordered to Write the
Bordereau, and the Ministers Knew
It Was Forged,
mander-In-chief of the army of the
Philippines.
"It is hardly fair to say that General
Otis had no active commands in the
field before being sent to Manila, In
deed, the fact is General Otis cut a very
creditable figure in .the war against
Sitting Bull, he having command of a
regiment in that exciting campaign. It
is true that he has never gone to the
front in the Philippines, but then neith
er I nor any other subordinate officer
had any means of knowing what in
structions may have been -sent him
from Washington. I was second In
command under him, and he was com
mander-in-chief; it was not necessary
for him to go to the front. He directed
affairs from his headquarters.
"His censorship of the press was per
! haps a trifle too rigid at times, but I
have never heard it said until now that
he claimed the privilege to make all the
heroes of the Philippine war or that he
! eliminated laudatory mention of Funs
ton or other active campaigners. About
i the only complaint heard against Gen
eral Osis in the Philippines while I was
there was that he personally undertook
too much, leaving hardly anything for
I his subordinates to do.
"The statement that he kept General
Lawton from taking part in active
I operations for five days Is a misstate
. ment. General Lawton came to succeed
: me, and when he arrived I was in the
midst of an important maneuver, which
it was necessary for me to finish before
he took charge.
"I don't believe that General Otis ever
made the statement attributed to him
in regard to not allowing the American
public to know anything about the
campaign that would excite or agitate
it. I am an intimate friend of General
Otis and have been at the same post
with him for a number of years. We
were good friends while i was in the
Philippines.
"The statement that he exercised any
censorship over Admiral Dewey's cable
t messages is absurd. He could not do
so, because the naval cipher code is dif
ferent from the army cede. Then again.
it would have been a discourtesy be
tween the two branches of the service."
DIRECT OVERTURES â¢
FROM INSURGENTS
WASHINGTON, July 18.â Secretary
Hay confirmed to-day the CaJl-Herald's
SAN ER AN CISCO, WEDNESDAY, JULY 19, 1899.
exclusive announcement this morning I
of the receipt of an important dispatch
from the Philippine Commission giving
optimistic views respecting the Philip
pine situation.
Secretary Hay was empowered by the
Cabinet at its meeting to-day to make
public an extract from the report of
Colonel Denby descriptive of the condi
tion of affairs:
It can be added that further informa
tion received from Colonel Denby and
General Otis, which was not made pub
lic, is to the effect that overtures in the
direction of peace have been made by
prominent Filipinos. At least one Cab
inet officer with whom I talked inter
preted the dispatches to mean that
Aguinaldo and some of his subordinates
are concerned in these. The authorities
are still disinclined to discuss the mat
ter because, in the first place, they are
not very sanguine that the negotiations
will be attended with satisfactory re
sults, and, in the second place, it is
not wished to acquaint the opposition
to the Americans in the Filipino ranks
with the communications passing be
tween their leaders and the Americans,
because of the danger that it might
prevent their success.
Conservative leaders of the adminis
tration, remembering' the optimistic
conclusions drawn in the past from of
ficial dispatches from Manila, are in
clined to believe that present communi
cations with the Filipinos will not bring
final peace, though they may impress
upon the native leaders the exact in
tention of this Government. They ex
pect no cessation of hostilities, and
think peace will not come until after
another campaign. Most of the officials
estimated that peace would not be re
stored until six months, but certainly
within a year. One member of the
Cabinet, however, is sanguine enough
to believe that volunteers will not be
needed at all.

PARIS, July 18.â The Rennes cor- |
respondent of the Journal des l
Debats says: "The Dreyfus
court-martial will not begin its
sittings until August 10.
The Matin this morning publishes p_
statement of Comte Ferdinand Walsiti
Esterhazy, .in which he says that he j
wrote the bordereau by order of Colo- |
nel Sandherr, and that it was sent to
the house of Colonel Schwartzkoppen, j
then military attache at the German
Embassy in Paris, whence it was return- ,
ed to the war office. Colonel Schwartz
koppen being at that time in Berlin,
never saw the bordereau, which was
forged in order to supply material
proof of the guilt of Dreyfus.
The statement contains the assertion
that secret agents in Berlin, whose tes- |
timony it was impossible to use, had
demonstrated that leakages had occur- ;
red In the war office and the fact that
treason existed was undeniable and ev
erything indicated Dreyfus as the trai- â 
tor.
All the war ministers, the statement
further says, knew the facts and
thought the forgery of the bordereau !
necessary. The evidence implicating
Dreyfus were the words put in Colonel ;
Schwartzkoppen's mouth. General Mer
cier, De Boisdeffre and Gonze knew I
that the bordereau was forged, and j
that Dreyfus was illegally convicted.
I
tacho, former Filipino Cabinet Minister,
believes that Aguinaldo and other rebel
leaders would welcome opportunity
for a peaceful settlement Of the war,
as before Artacho's escape from Imus
a majority of the people were disgusted
at the non-success of the Filipino arms
and regarded Aguinaldo's followers as
bandits. Artacho is absolutely friendly
to the Americans, but maintains that
the Filipinos will doubt, all proclama
tions unless made by Congress. He fur
ther declares that the rebellion is now
being conducted solely for personal ag
grandizement. An independent Filipino
Government, he asserts, means domes
tic slavery, and misery and ruin would
quickly follow. Personally Artacho
places absolute confidence in the Amer
icans' ability to restore peace and lead
the islands to prosperity.
Artacho is about to bring an action in
the Hongkong Supreme Court to re
cover from the Filipino Junta $100,000
(Mexican) as his share of the peace
purchase money transmitted here by-
Spain. A friend with whom he resides
has received a threatening letter.
Isabelo Artacho is one of the most
prominent of the Filipino patriots who
for years fought the Spaniards. A
trained lawyer at Manila, he early es
poused the cause of his countrymen.
He was Aguinaldo's Minister of the In
terior in the second rising, and when
Primo de Rivero . bought peace by
paying large amounts to the leaders of
the insurrection he was left as hostage
with the Spaniards to effect the dis
arming of the natives. Upon his release
he began suit at Hongkong against
Aguinaldo to restrain him from taking
the money which had been sent there
by v Rivero for the insurgent junta. As
a result of this action, when he returned
to Cavite folio-wing Dewey's victory, he
was promptly thrown into prison by
order of the rebel dictator, and several
of his relatives were similarly treated.
In an interview with the Herald cor
respondent in Cavite Prison on August
5 the ill-treated patriot bewailed the
wrongs he had suffered. Nothing has
been heard frc-m him since, but it can
easily be inferred from the special cable
dispatch here given that he has been
held prisoner and only recently escaped
from Aguinaldo's toils, possibly during

Special Dispatch to The Call.
Writing of the situation in Samoa
on June 16 The Call's special corre
spondent at Apia said:
''The situation is not one that
promises a lasting peace. If Com
missioner Eliot refuses to recede from
his present ground it is almost cer
tain that the commission will not
succeed in concluding the work it has
begun, and a conflict between the two
! factions of natives which will again
involve the whites may be looked for
at an early date."
From the tenor of the dispatches
from Samoa this morning it is ap
parent that the clash has come.
Whether the result will be serious
remains to be seen. Readers of The
Call, knowing how close the Asso
ciated Press Agent is to Chief Justice
Chambers, will be permitted to doubt
the accuracy of that agent's informa
tion about President McKinley's de
sire to retain Chambers in his po
sition.

Florence Parker Closed Her Life
With a Night of Reck=

Efforts Made to Have the Girl's Body
Quickly Cremated to Prevent
Expose of the Tragedy.
â¢â â .-'-.
Florence Parker died by her own j
hand.
That the dubious reputations of those
who had brought her to what she was I
might not suffer the Coroner has said
her end came naturally and in the or- j
der of. things, but facts have come up j
into the light of day that give the lie j
direct to that official's statement and j
lend to Florence Parker's story all the
glamor of a romance of the half world.
It is a story that has had and will j
always have its parallels so long as San
Francisco's mighty undercurrents are j
permitted to flow as strong and deep: j
and for so long as the city's Coroners
rob those who have not yet been set j
afloat upon them of the examples that
might deter.
Of the world which she left Florence
Parker was a pronounced type. Of her
companions who were gay she was the
gayest and she claimed more beauty.
She was magnetic and won to herself
after once she had been started friends
of wealth and influence. She was an
extremist in all things that appealed to j
her inborn love of excitement and in- i
ordinate, jangled passions.
In the gay, garish throng that made j
infamous and memorable the night of j
the celebration of the Fall of the Bas- j
tile at the Chutes she was a prominent
figure. She had gone out to see and |
had, after her fashion, stayed to par- j
take. It was a day of wild, feverish
j merrymaking, was that Frankish cele- |
. bration, such a day as only the hot
blooded denizen of the French colony
could start going and such a day as
only the hotter-blooded half world could
bring to the bedlam it was at the finish.
From the first fanfare of trumpets in
the morning to that time in the evening
when the "grÂ«en lady" was set up as
goddess of the night it was the day of
the Gaul. After that it belonged to the
tenderloin,, and the tenderloin put it to j
characteristic use.
From the less enthusiastic ones who
were poking fun at the animals in the
zoo Florence Parker found her way
through the crowd to the door of the
big theater, with its thousand lights
and tawdry tinsels. Her friends were
everywhere; with the dancers on the
floor, with the drinkers who were drip
ping their absinthe at the tables around
the entrance, and in the cafe where wild
est orgies were already breeding. It was
only a suggestion that was needed to
plunge her, body and soul, Into the gid- j
dy maelstrom, and the suggestion
j came. From the moment she went out
onto the dancing floor the fever of the
night entered into her blood and "the
melancholy that had led her there she
knew no more till morning.
From the ballroom the party that
had gathered around her were attracted
by a crowd of students who had turned
j themselves loose in the big cafe. They j

loin from their escorts and set them
dancing on the tables. It was such a
dance as made the Midway famous,
and inspired by many cold green drinks,
the women were showing no small skill.
Some cine in the party struck a tray
filled with glasses from the hand of one
of the rushing waiters. One of them
fell at the feet of Florence Parker, and,
seizing it, she quickly jumped to a
near-by table, held it at arm's length
and deftly kicked it hack into the
crowd from which it had come.
In a minute a fight had started, the
dancers were forgotten, and police,
students and laughing women were
mixed in a yelling, cursing crowd that
forced the cause of it all and her com
panions out through the doors and over
to the whirling hobby-horses that spun
round under a tent near the entrance.
A whirl on these and more to drink, the
Chutes and Florence Parker was miss
ing.
At 8 o'clock Saturday morning, the
morning of her frenzied debauch at the
Chutes, the maid hastily wakened Mrs.
Ella Parker and told her that Florence
was in her room and in a serious con
dition. Mrs. Parker quickly wakened
State Senator Sigmund Bettman, and
together they hurried to the girl's room.
She lay on her bed, unconscious, breath
ing heavily, her face fast purpling. It
was evident to them she was suffering
from poison. They hastily applied an
tidotes and worked over her for half an
hour. Then Senator Bettman dressed
and quickly summoned Dr. Levlson.
All the physician's skill, however,
availed naught, for an hour after she
had been discovered she died without
having regained consciousness.
Florence Parker was 25 years of age
at the time of her taking off. When

came the mistress of George I. Bailey,
proprietor of the Golden Gate Stables
at Golden Gate avenue and Jones
street. Bailey was a man of wealth
and lavished money upon her. For
years he made her an allowance of $2"0
per month and decked her in gems of
much price. They lived part of the
time at her home at 1419 Devisadero
street, where the menage was com
pleted by the presence of Senator Bett

RIORDAN VISITS
CAMP FALLON
Fun in Camp of the League of the Cross Cadets.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, CAMP
FALLON, SANTA CRUZ, July IS. -
Archbishop P. W. Riordan journeyed
to Santa Cruz to-day and honored
Camp Fallon with his presence. His ar
rival in the city by the sea was an auspi
cious one. He reached' here on th* 1:45
o'clock train and was met at the depot by
the regiment. As the train pulled in tho
cadets lined the track and as the reverend
gentleman stepped from the car thj*Â»y pre
sented sabers, while the band played a
welcoming air.
Colonel Sullivan met the distinguished
visitor as he stepped off the platform and
escorted him to a carriage. The Arch
bishop was accompanied by Rev. Father
Cummings of St. Patrick's and Rev. Phil
lip O'Ryan, spiritual director of the
League of the Cross Cadets. Th â¢ car
riage was placed in the center of the regi
ment, and with the band playing martial
airs his Grace was escorted to Camp Fal
lon Colonel Sullivan then showed him
around the camp, and he was much
pleased with Its order and surroundings,
lie visited The Call's headquarters and
was shown photographs of camp scents.
In the evening the Archbishop gave a
dinner in honor of Colonel Sullivan and
his staff at the Sea Beach Hotel. The
guests of honor were: Colonel William P.
Sullivan Jr., Lieutenant Colonel Thomas
F. Ryan, Captain and Adjutant John P.
Duffy. Major Daniel J. McGloin, Major
Daniel C. Deasy, Major William 11. Mc

were: Mayor W. H. Lamb. J. M. Walsh,
Rev. Fathers O'Ryan, Dempsey, Cullen,
McNamee, Cummings; T. W. Kelly, J.
Doran of the Surf, T. Prendergast and
Louis Levy.
The Archbishop will leave for San
Francisco to-morrow, as will Fathers
Cummings and O'Ryan.
Had Dolphin dance hall been twice its
size it could not have accommodated the
crowd which attended the Cadets' initial
hop last night. Lieutenant Colonel Ryan
acted as floor manager, and when not ar
ranging some dance during the evening
the second in command of i the regiment
did stately maneuvering over the waxed
lloor. The music was supplied by Otto
Larscher and Steve Douglass, who play
the cornet and the snare deum In the
hand and the piano and violin in the or
chestra. Both proved themselves artists
on the latter instruments. Douglass' vio
lin playing was repeatedly encored.
Lieutenant Charley Flynn of Company
R is running opposition to the cook. At
3 o'clock this morning he strolled into
I camp and chaperoned about sixteen
cadets, principally officers, to the quarters
of the eating department and gave them
a sample of his cooking ability. Fried
eggs, chops and other dishes were turned
out for his admiring friends and they dis
played their confidence in his culinary
ability by eating heartily.
The slumbers of Captain Powers and
Lieutenant Terry of Company G were
rudely disturbed a half-hour after reveille
this mornbig by Lieutenant Toohey and
"Baby" Dewey". The former brought the
miniature six-pounder outside the sleep
ing officers' tent and the deafening re
port which followed awakened them hur
riedly. They are now concocting a scheme
whereby they may be revenged on their
unwelcome visitor.
The highest compliment that could be
paid the caterer by the cadets is heard
frequently at meal time. As the boys
march toward their taffies some hold
Spirit yells: "We want stew! What do
We get." And in one voice his compan
ions yell: "P-i-e!" At the last encamp
ment the wording was slightly changed,
as the food was not as good as that fur
nished by Abrahams. It was: "We want
pie! What do we get? Stew!"

CORRESPONDENTS' ROUND
ROBIN TO BE IGNORED
The President May Merely Suggest
That the Censorship Be
Less Rigid.
WASHINGTON, July 18.â No imme
diate action will be taken by the Presi
dent in regard to the correspondents'
"round robin." This was the decision
reached at the Cabinet meeting to-day.
Privately it was intimated that the
President might give General Otis some
unofficial suggestions as to the desir
ability of a less rigid censorship of press
dispatches. His present purpose, how
ever, is to allow General Otis to deal
wi'h the situation as he sees fit. This
I prayer at the boathouse and says grace I
at the breakfast table. He is in splendid
health and is the most popular man in
camp.
Colonel Sullivan Is-drawing the lines of j
discipline closer around camp. He will
not tolerate tardiness or absence from
drill without cause or permission. Last
night about twenty young men who
missed dress parade were put at cleaning
the streets. Later in the evening the
guardhouse was filled with cadets who
broke the rules of the camp or came in '
after taps. This morning the lazy ones
who did not attend church services were!
placed in the guard tent and afterward
compelled. *o clean the streets. The camp
is takir.^f.m a very tidy appearance in
consequence.
The "Goo Goos" and the - "committee"
of Company I>. composed of F. S. Smith.
B. Foley; F. Sullivan. Sergeant McCarthy.
F. i ineta, J. Mohun and E. I >oolan, held
a private picnic in the powder mill's can
yon on Monday. The boys managed to
reach camp without being blown up by
powder. but wen "blown up" by their
captains for coming in late.
The "Dewey Heroes" claim they were at
the front and therefore deserve to be
treated like "Hobsons." When asked toÂ»
relate a few of their experiences in Ma
nila the youngsters unblushingly explain
that they' were not in the Philippines but
on the water front.
The "four sports"â J. Walbey, L. T. :
Flynn, T. Connellan and T. F. Noble
lived up to their name last night and ;
were thrown into the guardhouse to re- |
pent. ; -
The guards were startled this morning
by a red flare In Company E's street. It j
seems that some mischievous members of ;
the latter company stole red fire out of one |
the tents and set it off. When the officer
of the guard arrived on the scene he found
the inmates of the tents in the vicinity
fast asleep and with angelic smiles on j
their countenances.
The "Owls" engaged "swell turnouts"
yesterday and went to Capitola Needless
to say, the handsome yoUng officers cap
tured all the pretty summer maidens at
the popular resort.
Sergeant Harry Owen's temperance lee- |
tures are becoming a feature of the camp. I
Each night the "Owls" congregate In his !
tent and listen to a discourse on the evils I
of drinking. The sergeant is a clever
mimic and takes off the various members
of the organization to perfection. Quar
termaster Sergeant "Brindle" McGinn and
Sergeant Major Dougherty occupy the
same tent and have been dubbed the "Hi
bernians."
Walter E.fDorn, president of the League |
of the Cross Cadets, arrived in camp yes- \
terday, armed with a camera and a de- I
termination to stay a week.
Dr. Sullivan has been administering all |
kinds of concoctions to the boys in camp. .
Some of the uncharitable among the lat- ;
ter heartily wish the doctor would take I
some of his own medicine.
According to "Jack" May, the Evils of ;
Company I cry for more pie and are at
outs with the cook. John Rodaman, Bob j
Smith and Joe Rlsaka are members of the |
Evils.
The "Jolly Quintet." alias the "Peanut
Tribe," composed of A. Zarate, E. Hll- i
lard. A. Rossi, a. F. McCarry and J. a.
Riddell. is enjoying life in Camp Fallon. ;
The tribe has decorated its tent and keeps
open house. Fair visitors are presented
with cards as souvenirs of their visit.
H. Fivaz. J. H. Buckley, J. King and H.
Ford are known as the "Four Stumps,"
and live in Hogan alley.
The "Coal Heavers" are a representa
tive body in camp. Corporals "Sprinter"
Gulnee and "Sharkey" Beasley and Pri
vates Dwyer and Foley are members of
that important organization. A lump of!
coal hanging from the ridge pole is their I
sign.
Companies H, M and R are going on a
ride to Capitola Wednesday. Lieutenants I
Keating and Flynn are great favorites I
with the boys.
There is a large attendance each morn- |
ing at ft:3o o'clock at the beach owing to J
the presence of the regimental band.
"Jack" Sullivan of Company H was one j
of the many who had to clean streets last
night. "Jack" avoided work by directing
the efforts of the other unfortunates.
The "Insane Asylum" tent in Bellevue j
was the advice given him by at least
two members of the Cabinet. In the
light of the latest advices from the
Philippines, the President believes the
situation has so much improved that
the complaints made by correspond
ents, however just at the time they were
submitted, do not now exist.
He Is still hoping that the optimistic
views held by the Government's repre
sentatives in Manila may soon be real
ized and he will thus avoid taking ac
tion in the present controversy. In
other words, he is pursuing the usual
drifting policy. Some officials do not
see how the President can avoid taking
a hand in the matter, and the predic
tion is made that Otis will order the
correspondents away from the Philip
pines and thus precipitate a situation
in which the Chief Executive must take
decisive action, even to the sending of
a new commanding general to the isl
ands. Those who do not entertain rose
colored views are impressing upon the
President the advantage, aside from
showing the country the desire of the
administration not to muzzle the press,
of designating an officer to have spe
cial charge of military operations. .'-VV

among the people that General Otis has
not pushed the campaign in the Philip
pines as vigorously as should have been
done, and that it might be well for the
President to put another general in au
thority. I believe the people would like
to see General Miles sent to the Philip
pines and placed in command. There
is general confidence In his abilities as
soldier and campaigner. I do not know-
General Otis and personally have no
disposition to criticize him, but I think
I reflect the views of many in making
these statements. Out in the West â
and, for that matter, I think the same
feeling prevails all over the country â
the people are united in demanding that
Aguinaldo must be put down. We will
have to conquer the Filipinos before we
can do anything with them. The in
ception of all this trouble was in the
United _ States Senate. Delay in the
ratification of the treaty caused the
outbreak. If the treaty had been rati
fied promptly the Filipinos would have
realized that we were presenting a
united front and would have accepted
the benefits intended for them. The
only thing to do now is to whip them
into subjection, and the people would
like to see that done as soon as pos
sible." 7;b ?

m
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, July IS.â The fight be
tween the regular Democratic organ
ization of Cook County and the State of !
Illinois, represented by Mayor Har
rison and National Committeeman
Gahan, on the one side, and the Altgeld
wing of the Democracy, which support- i
ed ex-Governor Altgeld as an inde
pendent candidate for Mayor at the I
last election, on the other, reached an !
acute stage to-day and threatens to in- I
volve the National Committee in spite j
of the strenuous attempts being made
to keep local quarrels out of the pro- j
ceedings at next Thursday's meeting of ;
the National Committee in this city. j
Hon. Thomas Gahan, National Com- ;
mitteeman from Illinois, in an open let- [
ter to-day to the leaders of the Altgeld
element of the party, gives his reasons !
for declining to attend the Auditorium j
meeting of Thursday night, and in- i
directly appeals to his colleagues of the j
National Committee to refrain from ;
attending the Altgeld meeting. In
terest is added to the occasion by the ;
report of Governor Altgeld's friends
that Bryan, some days ago. accepted j
the invitation to address the meeting.
The letter of National Committeeman j
Gahan follows in part:
CHICAGO, July 18.â The Committee on
Arrangements, Auditorium Meeting of
July 20â Gentlemen: 1 am just in receipt
of your letter of July 17. tendering me
box 31 for the Auditorium meeting of
July 20.
The published statements of the chair
man *>* your committee have made it man
ifest, that this invitation is not tendered
in good faith, and not one which any be
liever in the Integrity of Democratic or
ganizations could be expected to accept
and, ordinarily, a mere declination of the
box tendered me would suffice; but since
I am informed by the daily press that
' a large number of invitations have been
sen! By your committee to members of
the National Committee, I feel it my duty
i as a Democratic National Committeeman i
j from the State of Illinois to give you and i
the public the reasons which make it Im- â 
possible that I could accept this invita
tion without stultifying the Democratic j
party of the State of Illinois and com- i
mitting an injustice to the Democratic j
party of Chicago.
The membership of your committee on j
arrangements, in whose behalf this in- j
vitation is tendered me, shows that in its
personnel this committee is entirely com- |
posed of gentlemen who, in April last,
opposed the regular Democratic candidate
for Mayor and other charter officers of
the city of Chicago and did all in their
'â  power to bring about the defeat of the.
j regular Democratic ticket and the elec- |
' tion of the regular Republican ticket at
thai election. Strange as it may appear
to those from abroad an examination of
the members of the other committees ar
ranging the proposed meeting at the Au
ditorium shows that every member of the !
several auxiliary committees likewise, op
posed the regular Democratic ticket and ,
j Its nominees in the Chicago election of j
last April and likewise sought to defeat !
the regular Democratic ticket and elect i
the Republican ticket at that election.
I am a believer in the rule of majorityâ j
and when the Democratic party ceases to j
I believe in the rule of majorities it will ;
cease to be the party of the people. * * * ,
In the three years that it has been my
honor to represent the Democracy of Ill
inois on the national committee I have
1 considered it my duty to labor for party
harmony in the State of Illinois and for
the conciliation of all elements in order j
that we might in 1900 redeem Illinois to !
the Democracy by sending twenty votes
to the electoral college for William J. :
Bryan and sharing in the triumph of that j
platform of principles for which the Dem- ,
ocratic national committee so faithfully j
labored against overwhelming odds in the
dark days of 189Â«.
If I saw in your proposed meeting, or in
the membership of your several commit- i
tees, a single indication to a hope of party j
unity; if you had held out for a moment
the "hand of good-fellowship, if you had
for a moment in your asseverations of |
Democracy indicated that you would have j
accepted the olive branch on any condi
tion short of a surrender of party organi- I
zation and party principles to the whim I
and caprices and exactions of a hopeless I
minority, I would have been the first to
make an overture, in the belief that the
first duty of a committeeman is to har- !
monize the elements of his party. But
your action and your declarations, and I
the announcement of your present inten- I
tions, have proved that you are not an j
element of the Democratic party; that its !
constituent principles cannot survive in
your atmosphere, and that to accept your
dictation Is to surrender that fundamental
doctrine which finds. in the rule of a ma
jority the success of the Democratic party.

American Philippine campaign as.it has
been managed by Secretary Alger and
Major General El well S. Otis. The St.
James Gazette says:
"The American people have been
hoodwinked by Its general and its ad

of suppressions of the truth and sug

genuity and thoroughness."
The Pall Mall Gazette says: "The cor

should."
The Times in its leading editorial ar
ticle to-day says: "Alger has run the
War Office as a political machine. Mili
tary posts have been bestowed upon po
litical friends without regard to fitness
or the interests of the country. Dis
honesty and corruption have been ram
pant wherever there was public money
to be handled. American soldiers were ,
killed by thousands on American soil
by such agencies as embalmed beef and
scandalous neglect of elementary sani
tation. As the head is, so we expect
subordinates to be.. They were chosen
without regard to fitness, but with ev
ery regard to political service. Natur
ally they act as the politicians they are
rather than as soldiers and administra
tors, which they are not. The new im
perial policy of the United States is
now discredited by association with a
system of corruption. McKinley, for
some reason or other, is incapable of
ridding himself of the incubus of his
Secretary, who, evidently regarding
himself as having the President in his
pocket, serenely defies the public indig
nation that has been aroused by his
mismanagement."

HANGED A BOY
IN HER YARD
Crime Charged to Widow
of Ex-Governor Ryer
son at Ensenada.
SAN' DIEGO. July llâ Advices received in this city to-day from Ense
nada state that the widow of the late ex-Governor Ryerson has been
arrested on the charge of murder and is now confined in the Lnsenaoa
jail. Her alleged victim was Jesus Gutierrez, a 10-year-old boy, wno
was found hanging to a tree this morning. The boy had been work
ing for Mrs. Ryerson. It is said that for some time past she has fre
quently beaten him for the sllghest cause. When the boy's body was dis
covered this morning life was extinct, and it was the opinion of doctors
that he had been hanging from the tree all night. Around the neck of the
boy was a dog collar, tp which was attached about forty feet of clothes
line. The line was thrown over the limb of the tree and the body drawn
up a short distance from the ground, but in such a position that the boy
could have stood on his feet if he had been conscious.
A post-mortem examination showed that the boy's neck was broken, but
there were no bruises on his body indicating that he was first killed and
that the dog collar had then been placed about his neck.
The preliminary examination thÂ« afternoon revealed the fact that Mrs.
Ryerson had quarreled with the boy last night. Cries were heard in the di
rection of the Ryerson house, but the Ensenada people paid no attention to
them, thinking that it was the usual cry of the coast guard. Soon af ' er '
ward Mrs. Ryerson appeared on the street looking for the boy. She had
been drinking, it is claimed, and was somewhat the worse for mescal.
When arrested she stoutly affirmed her innocence and ignorance of the crime.
She was taken to the prison and under the Mexican law she will be held
incommunicado for seventy-two hours. It is impossible, therefore, to obtain
a statement from her.
Mrs. Ryerson's many friends in this city believe that she is innocent of
the crime, and that if/fche is given a fair trial she will be speedily cleared
of the charge. She Is known as a woman with a motherly affection Tor
children and the possessor of many noble qualities. Prior to her marriage
to the late ex-Governor Ryerson, which took place in Ensenada in 1854, Mrs.
Ryerson was Miss Guadalupe Serrona. She is about 60 years old. Her par
ents originally came from Sonora and settled in Lower California in 1851.

San Isidro, Luzon, betweeen its special
correspondent, Martin Tew of the Thir
teenth Minnesota, detailed by General
Wheaton as brigade interpreter, and
Major Lorenzo L. Zialcita, leader of
Aguinaldo's cavalry and one of the Fili
pino commissioners who went to Gen
eral Otis with proposals for an armis
tice.
Major Zialcita denied emphatically
that Filipino officials had ordered the
burning of Manila and the wholesale
murder of Americans, and cited as
proof that many Filipino officers were
in Manila that night and were taken
prisoners. He said the proclamation of
General Otis, proclaiming himself Gov
ernor General, had greatly incensed the
Filipinos, but asserted that both the
Filipino leaders and the people believed
the Americans had begun the hostili
ties.
Major Zialcita, speaking of the re
puted promises of independence made
prior to the fall of Manila, when asked
by Mr. Tew if In their eagerness for in
dependence the Filipinos had not mis
understood or misconstrued the lan
guage of American officials and officers,
replied:
"There is not the slightest mistake
about this. Consul "Wlldman verbally
made this statement to us, and we had
so much confidence in the good inten
tions of the United States that to us It
meant as much as if it had been de
livered in writing.
"Besides, when we were in Cavite a
number of us had the honor of enter
taining General Anderson at the Atheo
Rlzal. This was before Manila was
taken by your forces. General Ander
son on this occasion made a speech in
which he said the Americans had not
come here for the purpose of taking one
foot of territory with the view of per
manent possession, but for the purpose
of giving the Filipinos their independ
ence.
"On September 21. last year, on the
occasion of a fiesta a number of Amer
ican officers celebrated with us at the
residence of Pedarno Pachao, and all
expressed the same sentiments. On
many different occasions we were told
by men high in authority that Filipino
independence would be recognized."
"What was the opinion of the Fili
pino leaders in regard to General Otis'
proclamation of January 4?"
"That ' proclamation," replied the
major, "was decidedly bad and greatly
incensed the people everywhere. It
stated nothing clearly and promised
nothing. It was. non-committal on all
points except that Otis declared himself
Governor General of the island and that
our country had been purchased from
Spain. The Filipino people desired in
dependence, not annexation."
On being asked if he really thought
the Filipino people were sufficiently ed
ucated to conduct affairs of local and
national self-government, the young
Filipino leader replied:
"Our people have always been misrep
resented, both by the local and foreign
| press. The friars are our worst ene- ]
! mies and have been active in this re
; gard, as they have always tried to hold
lus in subjection.- Educational affairs
j have heretofore been In their hands
! and it has served their purpose to pre
j vent the people becoming too wise.
I But even at this, the vast majority of j
the people can read and write."
Major Zialcita was told that many
people in the United States believed it
a sacred duty foi* the United States to
j take possession of and govern the Phil-
I ippines, inasmuch as the natives were
not capable of self-government. To this
he replied:
"This would have been a reasonable !
proposition if we had demonstrated, !
after a fair trial, that our government
was inadequate to protect life, prop
erty and personal rights. How could
we prove our fitness or unfitness for
self-government until we had been giv
en an opportunity to show* what we
could do?"

AGONCILLO DECLARES
AMERICANS ARE BEATEN
Says Filipinos Will Fight Until
Pledges Made by Dewey
Are Fulfilled.
.Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1899, by James Gor
don Bennett.
PARIS, July IS.â The Herald cor
respondent interviewed Senor Agoncillo
to-day on the present situation in the
Philippines. Agoncillo said:
"I have read the account in this morn
ing's Herald of the difficulties of the cor
respondents in Manila in getting their
news out of the country. I have known
of this for a long time. The Manila news
paper. La Oceana Espanola, was sup
pressed by the military authorities out
there because it expressed views con
trary to those of the commanding general.
"The Filipinos have still the same ideas
and ambitions they always hadâ namely,
independence, and they will always fight
for it. From our point of view the
Americans are really beaten, since' they
cannot hold their own, and it will be
necessary to have many more thousands
of men to conquer the islands.
"What is the result of the campaign?
Nothing, so far as the Americans are con- !
cerned. The condition of the country In
Luzon is what it was before the hostili
ties broke out with the Americans. It is :
mostly in the hands of the Filipinos, ex
cept that the Spanish hold the island of
Jolo. Those portions of the island of !
Luzon which were formerly occupied are '
now held by the Filipinos. Besides
Manila, the Americans hold only Iloilo,
Cebu and Bacolnr. But they do not hold
' the country adjacent to these towns, ex
cept in the case of Manila,"
"If the Americans are determined to
continue the war to the end what will be
the result?" I asked. ..
Agoncillo laughed as he replied:
"We shall continue to' flght all the same.
But, mark you. we hold you to your prom
ises. Admiral Dewey, the commander of
the Petrel, Consul General Wildman of
Hongkong, Consul General Pratt of Sing
apore and Consul General Williams of
Manila all promised us that If we aided
the Americans against the Spanish our j
independence would be assured. It is now
denied that this promise was made, but
President McKinley knows what the true
state of affairs was and what our aspira
tions were.
"True. Dewey vanquished the Spaniards
on the sea, but It. was owing to the Fili- â¢
pinos that the Spanish were subdued on ;
the land. Have the promises made to '
our people been fulfilled? .-' '-
"We desire peace, but peace obtained
with honor. That is the aspiration of our !
people."

Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER, B. C. July IS.â
The steamer Garonne arrived to
night from St. Michael with 550
passengers and about one and a
half million dollars' worth of gold
dust. Between three-quarters of a
million and one million belongs to
the Canadian Hank of Commerce.
The largest individual.: amount is
that of T. S. Lippy of Seattle, who
is credited with bringing about
$300,000 from his claim on El Dorado
Creek.
HEALY. St. Michael Island. July 3
(via Vancouver. B. C, July 181,â The
steamers Roanoke and Garonne
have sailed from here with the
first big Installment of this season's out
put of gold from the Klondike. The
former has aboard nearly $3,000,000 in dust
end a quarter of a million in drafts. The
principal portion of the dust belongs to
the North American Trading and Trans
portation Company, the Canadian Bank of
Commerce and the Bank of British North
America. An employe of the bank and a
sergeant of the mounted police accompany
the shipment. The dust belonging to the
banks is consigned to the United States
Assay Office at Seattle.
There is probably $1,300,000 on the
Garonne, the principal portion of which
belongs to the Canadian Bank of Com
merce, T. S. Lippy and ex-Governor John
H. MeGraw, both of Seattle. Among the
passengers on the Roanoke and Garonne
are many who possess small amounts of
dust ranging from $2i_Â»jo to $20,000.
The Alliance and Laurada. which have
already sailed, had a number of passen
gers from Dawson, with more or less
dust. The Portia) belonging to the
Alaska Commercial Company, got away
yesterday for San Francisco with all the
passengers she could carry and about
$1,000-000 in dust belonging to the com
pany. Many small holders are aboard the
Portland.
An unconfirmed report of the perishing
cf twelve members of a party of thirteen
which left Seal last spring In a small
schooner in Kotzebu* Sound was brought
down. The party was headed by a Cap- j
tain â¢ â¢:.:.. His wife was the only sur
vivor.
A miner w.med Black was robbed of a
tack containing several thousand dollars'
worth of gold dust while coming down on
the Garonne. i
Late reports from Cape Nome, brought !
over by passengers on the steamer Dis- '
covery, are that the properties on which j
work is being done are richer than was i
anticipated. Lindl m. Bryntezen and
Lunderberg. the discoverers, are said to
have taken more than $2000 out of one or
their claims on Snow Gulch in one day
last week.
G. W. Price and G. Simpson, of Seattle,
bought a two-thirds interest in ten claims
located in the district by Harry Camp
bell for $7000. This is the largest amount
paid as yet for claims in the new dis
trict. Mr. Price says these ten claims
should produce this year close to $100,000.
The detail of troops under command of
Lieutenant Spaulding. sent over last week
by Captain Walker, has had plenty of
work to do since its arrival. For several
days previous to the soldiers' appearance
on" the scene there was a great leal of
town lot imping, but Lieutenant Spauld
ing quickly put a stop to it by informing
the offenders bat they must cease such
practices, on penalty of arrest.
The steam schooner Albion, which ar
rived off Anvil City several days ago. is
s.ill there, having been abandoned by her
crew, which had been stricken with the
gold fever. Other vessels have had simi
lar experiences. The Bertha, belonging to
the Alaska Commercial Company, was
abandoned by the majority of her crew
several days ago. and it was only after
a great effort on the part of her officers
that enough men were secured to bring
her to St. Michael. Within a month, it is
estimated, there will be 50,000 people in
the camp.
NEARLY A MILLION
PAID IN ROYALTIES
SKAGUAY (Alaska), July 14, via
Vancouver, B. C, July 18.â J. E. Ger
ouard, a member of the Yukon Council
of Administration, arrived here to-day
from Dawson on his way to Ottawa
with an official report to be laid before
the cabinet officials.
Concerning royalties, he said that
when he left Dawson the report for the
' month of June had not been completed,
but enough returns had been made to
state that the royalties for this season
would run over (800,000. The total out
put for the season he estimated at $20.
--000,000 and the discrepancy of the roy
alty as against this total output he ex
plained on the ground that the royal
ties had been diminished because it was
now only levied on over $5000 instead of
over $2000 and that the output of claims
which would thus escape the royalty
tax amounted to a large sum.
Commissioner 1 lerouard remarked
that tie administration had expended
f 525,000 on Improvements in the city;
$80,000 on hospitals, and in addition had
worked all the prisoners on what may
be termed city improvements.
Charles Anderson stands at the head
of royalty payers, having handed over
to the Government (44,000. He has
claims on El Dorado and also on Do
minion. Professor Lippy of No. 13. El
Dorado, ls a good second. Hall and
- Picotte of No. 17 El Dorado paid a trifle
over $30,000 in royalties, and Stanley &
"Wardner of Seattle, from No. 25 and 26
El Dorado, paid the royalty on $235,000
of gold dust. El Dorado is. therefore,
this season by far the heaviest pro
ducer.
KILLED THEIR DOGS TO
ESCAPE STARVATION
SEATTLE, July 18.â J. J. Hollister, a
civil engineer of Santa Barbara, Cal., who
arrived here last night on the steamer
Roanoke from St. Michael, Alaska, tells
of the narrow escape of a party of Kot

Oakland.
The party got lost, ran out of food and
was forced to kill and eat sixteen of its

KLONDIKE GOLD AND
NEWS FROM CAPE NOME
The Alaska Commercial Company's
steamer Portland arrived from St. Mi
chael yesterday morning with 126 passen
gers and a million in treasure. Of this
vast sum fully one-half belonged to S.
Stanley. C. Warden, Mike McGowan,
Thomas Connor and Hugh McGinley.
They brought their wealth down in seven
small boxes and a large one, which Stan
ley valued at $150,000. Warden went into
the Klondike In 18S7 and this is his first
return to civilization. Quite a number of
women came down in the Portland.
Th.- new fields at Cape Nome are very
rich, according to the statements of some
of th people at St. Michael. James M.
Wilson, superintendent of the Alaska
Commercial Company, writing upon the
subject, says:
"The first discovery of gold was
made in September, 1898, and good
prospects were made in October and
early In November. me instance that
has "been rifled is where a few men
with two gold pans and two rockers
prospected Anvil and Snow creeks
and in thirty-six hours cleaned. up
$171" net. At the present time almost
all the good claims within a distance
! of twenty miles of the coast have been
taken up". No work other than that on
the surface has been accomplished
owing to he presence of ice. The
ground and all creeks are frozen now,
but will thaw possibly within this
month. . , .
"Only a few inches of ground have
been scraped, but the product has
been very rich. A Mr. Price took from
claim No. 7 on Anvil Creek in a few
.lavs $10 000 from the surface. Equally
large amounts have been taken from
Snow Dry, Dexter and Glacier creeks
and some others show excellent pros
pects. The output of gold this season
will be limited.
"I enclose as accurate a sketch or
the district as I can obtain, hut I do
not think the distance from the head
waters of the creeks to the in et of
Clarence Bay is as close as Indicated
In the sketch."
The Mr Price mentioned is "Gabe"
Price a brother-in-law of C. D. Lane, the
millionaire mine owner. Price evidently
wrote to Lane, for the latter purchased
the schooner Vega and steamer Townsend
and built the launch Goslin. The Vega he
loaded with 2SO tons of coal and a big
lot of lumber and the Townsend took sup
plies The schooner is now at St. Michael
awaiting the Townsend. Lane is on the
latter vessel and when she arrives at &t.
Michael will tow the Vega to Cape Nome.
The Portland is going hack to St. Mi
chael and Cape Nome just as quickly as
she an be discharged and loaded. it
nothing unusual happens she should get
away next Saturday afternoon or Sun
day morning. _.Â«.â¢_â ____ .
One of the passengers on the Portland
says the Cape Nome diggings are a fake.
"The 51 000 which was supposed to have
been taken out at Cape Nome by two
men ' said he, "was packed Into tie- dis
trict by people interested in selling claims.
There have been no discoveries worth
mentioning at the Cape. It is barely pos
sible that gold may be found there, but
these pockets are so scarce that the dis
covery of them can enrich only a few
men." _______ â-

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JULY 19, 1899.
DOOLOTTLE`S TALE
IS CONFIRMED
Arrival of His Wife in
Covelo.
â â¦ â
Special Dispatch to The Call.
COVELO, July IS.â There is scarcely
a story of the old Scotch border raids
which eclipses in intrigue and cowardly j
cruelty the confirmation of the Doolittle j
compulsory retraction tale told by Mrs.
Doolittle. wife of the victim, who came
into Covelo to-day and was interviewed
regarding the retraction story brought
in by Mr. Zaccarini yesterday. She con- j
firmed the report in all its leading feat- j
ures, the essential difference being that
J. M. Brophy represented himself as a
United States marshal and placed her
husband under arrest and took him
straight to Blocksburg, in Humboldt I
County.
When the party arrived at Blocksburg I
a notary public was not to be found,,
and some little delay was occasioned
there. Justice of the Peace Jamisen
was requested to take the affidavit of
retraction. During the time it required ,
in preparing the documents Doollttle j
gave the entire posse the slip, losing his
horse and taking to the mountains !
afoot. He was overtaken a few miles j
from his. home, when the occurrence
previously reported was enacted. Doo- !
little, after making his second escape,
went directly to the home of Hiram
Wilbur who accompanied him to
Weaverville. When they arrived at ;
Hay Fork he telephoned to Sheriff Ber
gen, who immediately set out to meet i
him on the way. In company of the j
Sheriff they returned to Weaverville,
where a telephone message awaited the
Sheriff from Hay Fork, inquiring if
Frank Doolittle was in Weaverville.
The Sheriff replied that he was not.
The circumstance is evident that Bro
phy and his gang were on a hot trail in
pursuit of Doolittle.
Sheriff Bergen returned with Doolit
tle, but has not yet made any arrests.
Mrs. Doolittle returned to her Red
Mountain home this morning. When
asked If she was not alarmed she re
plied: "Not for myself, but I expect at
any moment to hear tl\at my husband
has been killed by some of his enemies."
J. M. Brophy is an assumed name,
some claiming that he is a detective
working in the interest of Joe Gregory,
others that he is a renegade in search
of notoriety. He has but one arm. but
has the powerful build of an athlete.
Mrs. Doolittle connects John Vinton,
Buck Laycock and Thomas Hayden and
Frank Russell, a red-haired man, pro
fessing to be a doctor, and parties un
known to her, as part of the Brophy
posse. The first three are under indict
ment for murder in Trinity County in
connection with the Littlefield lynching.
Every one expects some unusual devel
opments at any moment, especially
when Sheriff Bergen arrives.
DOUBLE TRACK ON THE

DENVER. July 18.â A special to the Re
publican from Cheyenne, Wyo.. says:
From a reliable source it is learned that
the Union Paciflc has decided to make its
Omaha-Ogden line a double track road
to meet the demands of business.
The first section of additional track is
to be built between this city and Laramie
over the Sherman Mountain, a distance
of fifty-six miles. The road is already
using the most powerful locomotives so
as to handle as much business as possi
ble with each train.
CAUSE OF DEATH
A KISSING BUG
Statement in a Certificate Re
cording the Demise of a
Chicago Woman.
CHICAGO, July 18.â Officials at the Health Department to-day re
ceived a death certificate bearing the name "Mary Steger," which read:
"Chief and determining cause of death the sting of a kissing bug;
consecutive and contributory, tonsilltis."
It was the first time in the history of medicine that the kissing bug
had been given place on a death certificate, and the document was re
turned to Dr. George M. Illingworth, whose name was signed upon it.
Dr. Illingworth was ordered to take the story of the kissing bug to the
Coroner.
"When the ' Coroner was informed of the strange cause of Mrs. Steger's
death Dr. Springer was detailed to make an examination. Upon the ar
rival of the Coroner's physician at the undertaking rooms he found the
condition of the body, owing to the use of embalming fluid, was such
that he could not definitely determine the cause of death. The face was
badly swollen, and the body showed all the usual signs of blood poisoning.
Plainly Mrs. Steger had been bitten by something. There was a small
abrasion on the upper lip.
Dr. Illingworth, who attended the examination conducted by Dr.
Springer, stood stoutly by the theory that Mrs. Steger died from the ef
fects of the sting of a kissing bug.
"Mrs. Steger was stung six days before her death," said the doctor.
"She distinctly remembered having been stung, but did not succeed in
capturing the bug. The sting was on the upper lip. and the mark was
plainly perceptible, even before the face swelled. Mrs. Steger had been
suffering for a long time from tonsilitis, and I think the swelling may
have spread into the tonsils and thus helped to cause death. But there
is no doubt in my mind that the woman died primarily from the sting of
a kissing bug." 'frf'f -
CRIME AND
THE KISSES
OF HOBSON
Lombroso Takes a Pessim
istic View of This Latest
Phenomenon.
TALKS oT LIBERTY
â â¢ â
Our People Carried Away by
Military Ardor in the
Philippines.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1599, by James Gor
don Bennett.
LONDON, July 18.â Lombroso, the
Italian criminologist and alienist, has
contributed an article entitled "An Epi
demic of Kisses in America" to the
forthcoming August number of the Pail
Mall Magazine. To Lieutenant Hobson
the learned professor ascribes the in
ception of this epidemic, and he finds
that this sudden ebullition of kisses in
America is so strikingly phenomenal as
to call for some examination from a
pathological standpoint.
The professor starts out with a mis
statement of fact, inasmucli as Hob
son's first experience with kissing in
public did not take place at Vassar Col
lege, as the professor asserts, but at
Long Beach.
Again, the professor seems to have
taken too seriously the exaggerated re
ports of Hobson's kissing bees, as wit
ness his opening statement:
"The doughty deed of Lieutenant
Hobson, who scuttled the Merrimac in
Santiago Harbor and freely risked his
life in the bold project of locking the
Spaniards in their own port, is fresh in
the memory of all. We are told that
when, after the war, the gallant sailor
gave an account of his exploit at Vas
sar College, a lady who was at his lec
ture expressed a wish to kiss the hero,
and her example was followed by all
the ladies present.
"Hobson subsequently lectured in all
the leading cities of the United States,
and in the course of his tour he was
kissed by- no less than 10,000 women.
Now, when we consider the reserve of
the Anglo-Saxon race in expressing its
enthusiasm; when we consider the
modesty of its women, and when, above
all, we consider the self-possession and
hardheadedness of th*- American citi
zen, this phenomenon appears so strik
ing as to call for some explanation from
a pathological standpoint.
"In the case of Hobson's 10,000 kisses,
the strangeness and unconventionally
of which were heightened by their pub
licity, the most striking fact is that he
was addressing a crowd of especially
elite persons. A crowd is a domain
in which microbes of evil develop more
rapidly than microbes of good, because
the good elements of the individual are
eliminated by numbers or by the pres
ence of even a single morbid element.
The disturbances arise mainly from the
stronger influence which a few de
praved persons in a crowd exercise
upon it, for, being of an active nature,
they oversway the virtuous, who are by
nature more passive.
"This baleful influence is yet more
marked in a crowd of women, partly
because it includes a larger proportion
of hysterical persons who give and re
ceive suggestion more readily than oth
ers, and partly because, aside from
their hysterical tendencies, women are
more open to suggestion, more inclined
to run to extremes than men. In a
highly cultured race, in a crowd where
women preponderated and under condi
tions of most justifiable enthusiasm the
outcome, at best no crime, was never
theless a breach of social decorum, a
violation of that sense of modesty
which is so keen in the Anglo-Saxon,
for whom the price of a stolen kiss may
amount to a heavy fine.
"A subsidiary cause of this breach of
decorum may have been that sort of
imperlalistlco-military ardor kindled
in the United States by the infamies ct
Spain, with its absurd and impolitic re
suit of the conquest of the Philippines,
so contrary to American feeling and
tradition."
Concluding, Professor Lombroso says:
"Few men are so worthy of admiration
and enthusiasm as Hobson, whose Mer
rimac exploit is one of the bravest
deeds of our time, and an account of
it given by the hero himself was bound
to foment the enthusiasm of his hear
ers, who felt as though they had act
ually been present. Under these circum
stances the kissing phenomenon loses
much of its pathological aspect, more
especially as women are always warm
admirers of military valor. The very
prosaism which permeates our times,
especially in America, makes these ex
ceptional deeds the more provocative
of admiration and enthusiasm. It would
augur well for the glory of the great
republic on which, at this time, the
gaze of the whole liberal world is fixed,
if in the flush of victory the military
ardor of your American cousin had re
stricted itself to this single act. It
would augur well if. having set one
people free, they had refrained from
girding on the sword to force another
into slavery."

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL. July 18.â An accusation
of attempted arson made by a hysterical
woman has thrown the neighborhood of
Fifth and Grand avenues Into a state of
siege and three angry men, armed with
revolvers, are uttering threats of such
a nature that none of the women living
in the vicinity dare to show themselves
on the street for fear of being hit by a
bullet during a fusillade. Late this even
ing the situation became so serious that
when Marshal Healy learned that City
Assessor W. F. Dougherty and son had
tried to draw a brother of County Assess
or Ira Parks into the street from his resi
dence and that Parks* wife had fainted
from fright he sent Constable Lewis
Hughes to the scene to take any neces
sary steps to prevent bloodshed.
Dougherty and Sylvester Parks live side
by side and for over a year have been on
unfriendly terms. Yesterday a shed in
the rear of the City Assessor's house was
set on lire by his little boy, Sherman,
while the lad was trying to destroy ver
min. The damage was nominal, but Mrs.
Parks declared on the street to-day that
this was the second time the property
had caught fire in a year. She said that
Dougherty was trying to burn his prop
erty to get the insurance and she lived
in fear that her own property would be
destroyed. The first fire occurred a year
ago and was the result of the same child
playing with matches. When Dougherty
heard of the declaration to-day his anger
led him to drink, in consequence of which
he and his son William armed themselves
and dared Parks to com.- outside. The
latter refused the invitation and warned
the two that any attempt to enter would
mean death. The news of the disturbance
was soon carried around the neighborhood
and dcors were bolted, while the occu
pants got out of harm's way.
Both the principals make strong charges
against each other and freely admit that
they are armed for "business." At a late
hour this evening all was quiet, but Night
Watchmen O'Brien and Miller are on the
alert to prevent a collision. Owing to the
prominence of the principals to the affair
and a hope that the men can be kept
apart until their better Judgment pre
vails no arrests have been made.

Prominent officers connected with the
war are here portrayed, as well as
many of the "men behind the guns."
Military* life is pictured to the eye, from
recruiting to guard mount and skirmish

a new wheel to Stamford, Conn., after
which he came to Utica by rail.
Mr. Davis said the roads so far had
been horrible. Continued rains in Cen

in several places entirely washed out
the roadbeds. In many places no effort
has been made by the authorities to re
pair them.
Where the roads were entirely wash

over these roads the automobile pro

would have found it impossible to pro

The new wheel is expected late to

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SOUTHAMPTON. July I*.â There was
much excitement on the Solent to-day
over the Britannia-Shamrock race. From
early morning crowds watched the prep
arations mi board both yachts, while the
whole fleet from Southampton, Cowes
and other points made for Ryde.
The scene at Ryde pier was most ani
mated. Long before the star! crowds of
fashionable visitors had arrived. The
Shamrock was towed from Southampton,
the Erin following with Thomas tiipton
and a distinguished company. The weath
er was hot and slightly hazy, with a
slight southeast breeze which promised
to last through the day. The course was
.from the Ryde pierhead eastward around
the Nab lightship, leaving it on' the star
board hand, then back past Cowes to a '
buoy on the Solent bank, rounding the
buoy on zhe starboard and finishing at
Cowes, opposite the Royal Yacht Squad
ron's house. It was about forty miles
long. The Prince of Wales arrived at
Southampton at 11 o'clock, wearing a
yachting suit, and boarded the Britannia
from the yacht Fire Queen, on board of
which he left Southampton.
The yachts started punctually at 12
o'clock, with a fresh southeast breeze
blowing. As the starting gun boomed the 'â 
Britannia Immediate crossed- the Sham
rock, the latter following in a way to give
the impression that she. had no objection
to giving the Britannia a slight lead. The
latter, however, did not long maintain tiie
advantage. It v. as a dead heat to wind
ward, and little distance was covered be
fore the Shamrock, whic.i started on the
short leg to port, overhauled her, and on
the following long leg to starboard the
Shamrock forged ahead rapidly. It was
at once noticed that she was sailing near
ly half a point rearer the Wind than the
Britannia. The Shamrock was carrying her
mainsail, jib-head-.) topsail, jib and fore
sail. The Britannia carried the same can
vas, but In addition her club topsail.
The Shamrock was a half-mile ahead
passing Warner. Hogarth was at the
helm of the challenger. The boat held up
admirably and there was not a drop of
water on deck. She proved extremely
quick In putting about, taking only lOU
seconds. On rounding the Nab lightship
both yachts set their spinnakers for the
run back.
The only mishap of the day was that
when the* Shamrock's sail began to fill
the top caught in the cross-trees. The
huge canvas flopped flat and then sud
denly burst like a balloon and a big rent
became visible in the upper part, where
a long strip had been torn out, leaving a
hole big enough for a man to crawl
through. The Shamrock's speed naturally
suffered somewhat from this accident.
Both boats soon set their " topsails and
later their balloon foresails. The yachts
jibed to port near Ryde. They were then
traveling at such a rate that the press
boat, going a speed of eleven knots, was
unable to keep pace with the Shamrock,
though the wind lightened considerably
after leaving Nab lightship. The Britan
nia appeared to be holding her own for
a short spell before she reached Ryde, but
the Shamrock again crept slowly ahead,
widening the gap.
The scene at this time was an inspiring
one. Both yachts, under a cloud of can
vas, were gliding on even keels. The wind
freshened after passing Cowes and both
boats took In their spinnakers a: 1 stalled
on 'the broad reach to the-. Solent buoy.
After jibing around they reached back,
finishing with a short tack to make the
home mark.
Experts were satisfied that the Sham
rock will be able to give a good account
of herself in the contest for the America's
cup.
The Shamrock passed Warner at 12:36:13
and the Britannia at 12:43 18. The Sham
rock rounded the Nab lightship at 1:00:25
and the Britannia at 1:00:20. The Sham
rock passed Ryde. pier tit 1:54:30 and the
Britannia at 2:02:30. The yachts passed
the Royal Yacht squadron's house going
westward, the Shamrock at 2:40:27 and the
Britannia at 2:51:00. The Shamrock ar
rived at the finish line at 3:46:00. The
Britannia finished the course thirteen
minutes hind the challenger for the
America's cup.
Both yachts were admirably handled,
but the Shamrock had a clear advantage
throughout. She gained on every tack
to windward.
The corrected times at the finish were:
Shamrock. 3:43:50; Britannia, 4:00:15. The
times of passing the buoy on the Solent
bank were: Shamrock, 3:15:45; Britannia
3:25:04. -:
FASTEST OF BRITISH YACHTS.
â >â
The Shamrock Does Not Show Her
Actual; Speed.
COWES, Isle of W*ght, July 18.â On the
actual difference in- the times of the
Shamrock and Britannia at the various
points and the times* at the finish of to
day's races it does hot appear that the
Shamrock has a gre(_t chance to win the
America's cup. Those signs, however,
may be deceptive. 1/ was the opinion of
those who closely witched the race from
the steamer following the yachts that the
Shamrock was never pushed to her ut
most In to-day's trlaj, and that Mr. Fife,
the designer of the; yacht, who practi
cally engineered the| contest on behalf of
Sir Thomas l_ipton. merely desired *.> as
certain whether the Shamrock could show
the Britannia a cle_.n pair of heels. He
had no desire, he slid, to let everybody
into the secret of th* actual merit or best
speed of the challenger.
Confirmation of th ' foregoing opinion Is
found In the fact that while the Britan
nia carried every possible stitch of can
vas, the Shamrock wias running before the
wind from the Nab. lightship to the So
lent bank buoy, and only her Jib headed
with the topsail instead of the club top-
Sail, like the Britannia, and that on the
broad reach home from the Solent buoy
the Shamrock lowered her jib topsail,
which would, have been of material as
sistance had her skipper really wished to
show her at her bes_.
Mr. Fife and Mr. Jamison were on
board the Shamrock, but Sir Thomas Lip
ton followed on board the Erin, which,
with a few yachts and one solitary but

crowded excursion steamer, escorted the
racers around the course.
The fresh breeze that was blowing at
the start dropped somewhat, but revived
sufficiently to bring the racers home at a
spanking pace and proved an excellent
wind from the racing point of view, as
it. enabled the cracks to be tested as to
three points, namelyâbeating to wind
ward, running and reaching. The Sham
rock showed to the best advantage beat
ing to windward, and gained six min
utes on the Britannia on the eight miles
beat to the Nab lightship from the start.
although beating is considered one of the
Britannia's strong points. On the run
back to ('owes the Shamrock's gain was
less perceptible, but she did not set her
club topsail, and so did not do her best.
On the reach home the Shamrock did bet
ter and could evidently have done the
distance in much shorter time if she had
been put on her mettle.
The Shamrock is decidedly the fastest
boat ever launched in these waters. No
other craft ever gave the Britannia such
a beating on a fair sailing trial. There
was considerable maneuvering of the
yachts before the start, and the opinion
was freely expressed that the Shamrock
did not appear to be so well bandied as
the Britannia, which was in the hands
of the veteran Carter, who skippered her
successfully against the Vigilant in ISM.
The Britannia was sailed beautifully and
excited general admiration among the Im
mense crowds of fashionable people who
witnessed the return of the boats from
every point of vantage.

currently, closing with the three-mile and
high jump. ' :;â  ' : ,
The question as to the number of trials
to be allowed In the hammer-throwing
and long; jump was the occasion of con
siderable discussion, the English rule be
ing four trials each and the American rule
six trials. A compromise will be reached
on six tries for hammer and five tries for
jump. for the high jump the usual cus
tom of both sides is three trials at each
bar. Runs under the bar do not count as
tries.

tion of selecting a mate for C. D. Daly,
Harvard, for the long jump will be de
cided between J. T. Harrington of Har

MIDDLE WEIGHT BOXERS WHO WILL DON FIVE-OUNCE GLOVES.
GEORGE GREEN.
GEORGE GREEN and Charley finff will be the stars of the boxing exhibition of the National Athletic Club to be
held to-morrow night in the arena at Woodward's Pavilion. It is the first bout in some months that seems to
promise the class of sport which local followers of the game enjoy. Both men are clever boxers and clean hitters,
with the strength of heavy-weights. Goff gained many followers through his meeting with Jim Franey recently,
in which he made a brilliant showing. Franey did not use his aggressiveness with good judgment, and his gallop was
brought to a sudden stop by his opponent. In Green the victor of the last fight will flnd a more dangerous adversary.
There is not a move in the game with which he is not familiar. That the sporting fraternity has confidence in him is
evidenced by the fact that he has been installed a warm favorite in the betting. At Harry Corbett's last night the
wagering was brisk, the prevailing odds being 10 to 7. On the preliminary bout between Jeffords and Jones the betting
was at evens. The Illustration is from photographs by Bushnell.

NEEL WINS AT TENNIS.
CHICAGO, July IS.â Carr Neel defeated
Allen of Yale in the final singles In the
Western tennis . tournament to-day. and
will, to-morrow meet Kreigh Collins for
the championship. Neel is looked upon as
almost a sure winner in the game with
Collins, as the latter has not this year
been putting up any such game as Neel
has played throughout the tournament.
â¢ The game between Neel and Allen to
day was long and hard fought, some of
the sets running up to twelve and four
teen before a winner was shown. Allen
played with desperation, but Neel put up
the same steady, careful game that has
carried him to victory so many times, and
Allen, although he made a good showing
at all' times, aid not look like a winner at
any time. The score was: C â l, 6 â 4, 2â6.
6-3.

Special Dispatch to The fall.
LOS ANGELES, July 18.â Santa
Barbara dog show will open to-morrow
wlth 200 entries. Crowds of Angelenos
have bough! special tickets and quite a
number of the members of the National
Educational Association have expressed
their intention' to enjoy Santa Barbaran
hospitality.
O. J. Albee. N. T. Stewart and J. Ber
ret have agreed to transfer their ancient
rivalry '.from the north to the south, and
the showing of collies consequently will
be a large one. Wegener's Redwood
cocker kennels will make their mark as
before. Los Angeles will send between
thirty and forty dogs of all breeds and
sizes. John W. Mitchell will be represent
ed by his fox terriers by Lomita Patchen-
Lomlta Ira. :â  ..''.-' ffyfyfy
Mr. Mitchell has been remarkably un
fortunate of late, having lost by death
his celebrated fox terrier Patch, which
took first prize in San Francisco, and also
his fine mastiff Rex. by Ingleside Crown
Prince-Lomlta Hilda. Rex was pro
nounced the best mastiff on the coast by
both Otis Fellows and James Mortimer.
He was a litter brother of the celebrated
Lola.
"Billy"' Murphy is going to take the
largest string from here. Murphy has be
come one of the most enthusiastic fan
ciers in the south, as was evidenced by his
extensive exhibit at San Francisco last
May under the name of the Orangedale
kennels. The bench show committee of
the Santa Barbara Kennel Club has hung
up a special prize for the handsomest ex
hibitor with a kennel, and It is said
"Billy" has a cinch on the trophy. Among
the more prominent dogs that he will take
up to the show are the St. Bernard Lady'
Bute H. by Reglor-Lady Bute 11. and
Orangedale Beauty, by Melrose 11-Lady
would be a credit to professional
adults, while little Cora Davis and
Johnnie Mangle did a plantation walk
that was enthusiastically applauded. J.
Walker Cole, the undefeated white
champion of the United States, and
Miss Georgie Brown gave a fine exhi
bition of cakewalklng as a flne art
that brought down the house.
To-night will be Native Sons and
Daughters' night, and they will all be
there. A special programme will be
put on containing many unique fea
tures in honor of the occasion:' On
Thursday afternoon, the next matinee
of the carnival, the programme will
consist of a cakewalk and Chinese baby
show combined. Two hundred midgets
from the flowery kingdom will be on
exhibition in all the glorious ' finery

on the card at Brighton to-day was the
Peconlc stakes, for three-year-olds at a
mile and a furlong. In which Ethelbert
and Martimas were the only starters of
account. Ellerdale being added simp y to
get third money. The start was quickly
made and the pair went away together
On the run to the first turn, which was
little more than a gallop, Martimas took
a lead of a length, which he sustained
around the lower turn and into the back
stretch, when Ethelbert began to cut it
down, and as they turned the upper curve
they were running head and head. They
hung together for a few seconds and then
Ethelbert slid away and the race was
over, for he made the gap wider with
every stride and pullel up at the end. With
the hollowest kind of a victory, in 1:55.

The open-air horse show of the Burlin
game Country Club, which was so marked
a success last year, both socially and from
a horseman's point of view, will be re
peated during the first week of Septem
. ber. It will probably extend over two
days, as the members of the club have
such a variety of equipages and so many
horses that the various classes cannot be
shown in one day.
The Burlingame show means the aban
donment for this year of the idea of hold
ing a show in this city. These exhibitions
some years since accomplished much good
in educating people as to the vogue in
horses, harness and vehicles. New types
of the latter were introduced by the score
and the result ls to be seen any day on
the Golden Gate Park drives. The shows
afforded a liberal education in the art of
driving, resulting in an improved style.

21, is gradually assuming shape. The pro
gramme will Include all the high class
sports of the field and the tastes of all
persons should be suited. There will bo
competitions in golf for valuable cups for
both men and women. If the polo clubs
of Southern California can send a team
there will be a match between the north
and south; otherwise teams will be formed
among the Burlingame men, each player
on the winning team to receive a cup.
For spectacular effect and action polo
outrivals all other sports, especially
when the men and the ponies are well
trained. â¢
There will be baseball between a Bur
lingame team, the foundation for which
will be found in the many athletes of the
Tobin family, and an outside team. A
yacht race between Duke, Harry Simp
kins' new boat, B. A. Wiltzee's schooner
and two others will be arranged if possi
ble. In addition the pigeon shooters and
the cyclers will be afforded an opportu
nity to show their prowess. Tbe last day
of "the week will be given over to pony
racing.
In order to carry through this ambi

will be placed in charge of some person
identified with it and he will be expected
to see that the necessary preliminary ar

Special Dispatch tc The Call.
NKW YORK, July 19.â An at
tempt was made to blow up the
elevated structure at Fifth ave
nue and Thirty-fifth street in
Brooklyn early this morning.
The police say that it was the
work of the strikers or sympa
thisers. One of the pillars of
the structure was shattered by
the explosion of dynamite 'at 1:10
a. m. The entire base of the pil
lar was blown t<Â» pieces and the
sides of ie pillar for several feet
were torn away. Several pieces
of steel were thrown through
neighboring houses. One piece
of large size, nearly an inch in
thickness, was blown through
the brick wall of a house at the
corner of Thirty-fourth street
and Fifth avenue. Another was
blown through a house at the
corner of Thirty-f.*urt . street
and Fourth avenue, while still
another dashed through th- iron
railing of the Greenwood Sub-
Cemetery. No one was injured.
NEW YORK. July 19.â At an early
hour this morning twenty-two strik- ,
ers? were placed under arrest suspected
of complicity in the South Brooklyn
dynamite explosion on the elevated ;
railroad. Acting under orders from
Chief of Police Devery nine detectives i
proceeded to the strikers' headquarters
at the corner of Rockaway and Atlan
tic avenues, Brooklyn, and placed all
of the strike leaders there found un- |
der arrest. The men are still under ar
rest. but it is expected they will be
given a hearing at 9 o'clock this morn- ;
ing before Justice Bristow of Brooklyn.
NEW YORK. July. 19.â The Journal
and Advertiser says: The employes !
on two lines of th- Metropolitan Street
Railway Company decided to strike at
5 o'clock this morning.
At a little before 3 o'clock this morn
ing eleven men employed on the Madi
[son and Second avenue lines of the
Metropolitan system, called on General
Master Workman Parsons and an
nounced their intention of striking at
once.
Mr. Parsons argued with the men
and attempted to convince them that
they were very foolish to take any
such action.
They replied that they felt it was j
their duty to aid the Brooklyn strikers.
The argument grew heated. Parsons j
finally refused to sanction their pro- i
posed act, whereupon the men left de
claring they would go out without th- j
authority of Mr. Parsons.
Mr. Parsons' reply to this declara
tion was: "Very well, if you will
strike T cannot stop you, but I wash
my hands of the whole matter."
During the conference the men told
Mr. Parsons that this was only the j
start of a general strike of all em- : ;
ployes of the Metropolitan Railway
system.

1 rushed to the assistance of the motor
â  man and conductor and frightened the
- crowd off by firing their revolvers in
the air. .
Three arrests were made and in less
: than fifteen minutes the cars were run
| ning. The police arrangements for the
' protection of life and property were as
! nearly perfect as possible.
It was remarked during the fore
! noon that trouble might be expected on
â  the Union Elevated railroads, but early
;in the afternoon President Rossiter
; stated that no hitch would occur there.
! The engineers on the elevated system
j had been notified that as soon as the
I third rail, or electric motor system was
i adopted, their wages would be reduced
j from $3 50 to $2 25 per day. The engi
! neers objected to this suggested reduc
| tion, but this afternoon they were as
' sured by the management that the rate
; of wages now- existing would be main-
I tamed.
Master Workman Parsons and Dis
, trict Master Pines were very confident
reaction on Mrs. Eltringham's mind has
set in and the breaking up of the happy
home is complete. Mr. Eltringham was
interviewed by The Call correspondent
and with a heart overflowing with
grief he told of the effect the drug used
by her despoiler had made upon the al
that the strikers would win the fight,
hut judging by the number of cars in
operation to-day the assertions of the
railroad managers that the strike would
fizzle out seem to be well founded. The
strikers are severely handicapped inas
much as that they have no funds to
back them up. and in many instances
there is a sad lack of concerted action
on the part of their leaders.
QUIET IN CLEVELAND.
CLEVELAND. July IS.â Whether or not
the quiet that has prevailed to-day pre
cedes a storm to come in the street rail
way strike is the question that everybody
is asking. The strikers are pursuing dif
ferent tactics from those followed in the
former strike. They are not interfering
with the non-union men who are operat
ing cars, nor will they tell what their
plans are. -â¢>â -â ,'-
The officials of the company also re
fused to talk, but they are operating cars
on several of the lines to-day under po
lice protection without molestation. Prep
arations are being made to resume ope
rations on other lines, and It is apparent
that new men are to be secured as rap
idly as possible to take the places of the
strikers. The State Board of Arbitration
is trying to bring about arbitration, but
thus far no success has attended the ef
forts in that direction.
DECKHANDS STILL OUT.
SACRAMENTO. July IS.â This * after
noon fourteen of the striking steam
boat deckhands went aboard the Sac
ramento Transportation Company's boat
Jacinto, which left for. the upper end
of the valley for a cargo of grain. The
other strikers were threatening trouble,
so the steamer pulled out with a few
men and the ex-strikers were taken up
the river in wagons and shipped when
beyond the city. It Is thought the rest of
the strikers will soon go broke and return
to work.
] ready weak mind of his wife. As the
I drug loses its power over her and she
: realizes the awful scenes she has passed
through her mind plainly shows a weak-
I er condition, and it is feared she will
I evade the vigilance of her watchers
; and take her own life. It is thought it
will be necessary to place her where
! she will be properly treated for her
| malady.
It was learned to-day that one day
| before his fatal visit to the Eltringham
! home Clark visited the home of a
woman between here and Vallecito and
; Insulted the mistress of the house. He
â  was promptly driven off the place.
At an autopsy held this morning it
was ascertained that the bullet tore out
. the heart of the dead man completely
and broke an arm and two ribs. Death
must have been instantaneous. El
; tringham will be held for a preliminary'
- hearing.
The verdict rendered by the Coroner's
jury has met approval. The verdict
exonerating Eltringham is looked upon
as the only one that could have been
! rendered in the face of the testimony.
But there are some who believe that the
sad affair was a premeditated murder.
j The fact that the father and brother
' of Mrs. Eltringham had, with Eltring
: ham, cut off all paths of retreat from
i the Eltringham house, In accordance
with a previous agreement between the
, three, is taken as evidence that they
j had deliberately planned to murder
lark. , *
Clark was a comparative stranger
here. He has been around Vallecito
and Angels .Camp for two weeks or
: more and seemed anxious to obtain
i employment. From the statements
made by Mrs. Eltringham it was gath
ered that the ex-volunteer was familiar
with her family affairs. Although El
tringham did not know Clark, or had
no recollection of having seen him be
fore he fired the fatal shot, Clark knew
Eltringham, whom he described to Mrs.
Eltringham as "that long fellow." and
said that he was afraid of him. He also
knew who her brother was and told how
jhe had ridden to town on a wagon
which Brattos was driving after one
of his expeditions to the Eltringham
place. Brattos did not know Clark. It'
is taken from this that the fiend had
\ carefully noted the time when Mrs. El
tringham would be alone.
STRUCK THE MAN WHO
DEFENDED MAYOR PHELAN
LIVELY SCENE AND ARRESTS AT A SOCIAL GATHERING.
There was a lively row at a banquet
j given by the Sons of St. George Society
j last night at the Alcazar building.
Just before the conclusion of the festivi
. ties Corporal of Police Williams, whose
I duties consist in looking out for Mayor
Phelan's office, arose to make a speech.
i He spoke of Phelan being one of the best
\ Mayors the city ever had, and proceeded
ito eulogize his administration. Edward
i Crasshey, a molder, who was present, ob
j jected to his remarks, and asked him if
I he had been sent to the banquet by the
I Mayor. Some hot words followed, during
j which Crasshey called Williams a
I liar. Williams started for Crasshey and
attempted to strike him in the face.
â¢ Crasshey dodged the blow ar.d planted
h.s right fist on Williams' eye. As the
I latter staggered back Crasshey struck
> him on the jaw, knocking him to the floor.
Knowing that Williams was armed with
' a revolver and fearing that he would
I shoot him. Crasshey dashed from Jhe hall
i and ran down O'Farrell street. Williams

The Red Cross Society has taken up the
matter of clothing the returning volun
teers, and will probably solve it In some
way within a day or two. It was thought
at one time yesterday the question had
been settled, and Mrs. W. B. Harrington
drove out to the Presidio to tell General
Summers that the department would fur
nish overcoats upon the receipt of the
men, the coats to be returned to the quar
j termaster when the men were mustered
I out. It seems some member of the so
! ciety gained that impression from Colonel
j Long, depot quartermaster, who, on be
i ing asked if he would furnish over
coats, replied that he had orders from
Washington to furnish all the warm
clothing necessary. This was taken to
mean that the clothing would be furnished
free to the men. Colonel Long also said
there had been a number of coats sent out
to the Presidio for the use of the troops,
but General Summers declared he had' not
seen them. Late in the evening Mrs. Har
rington admitted that perhaps there had
been a mistake, and the matter would
looked into further by the Red Cross bo
ciety. Â _. __
"I am beginning to believe," Mrs. Har
rington said last night "that the Govern
ment cannot furnish the overcoats to the
men unless by deducting the price from
their money, but we may hear more *
about it to-morrow. If the Government
cannot do it. then we must do it. *je .
must see that every man has all he
wants in the way of clothes, and then j
When he goes home he can turn back to |
us what we have loaned him and we can j
then let some other soldier be benefited. i
Colonel Summers has fixed the clothing i
matter to his own satisfaction by having ;
each captain see that the men he details j
to euard duty shall be provided with !
overcoats. That Is all he can do. he says. ;
unless he order each man to draw one, \
and this he does not contemplate, mere
are about three of four hundred over- j
coats on hand at the regimental head
auartersânot regulation army coats but ,
cheaper onesâ which are valued at less
than $5. These he will issue as fast as the
men wish to apply for them but so far
they have shown no Inclination to make
application. .'â¢â  _ .
The Government is now preparing to
ship cavalry horses by the thousands to
the Philippines and the commandant of
the Presidio Is making ready to receive :
them on their way across the ocean.
Three thousand horses and three hundred
mules have been purchased In the East,
and "they will be hurried out here as fast
as possible. The stables at the post will '
not accommodate more than three hun
dred horses, and the big corral at the
foot of the parade ground and behind the
cavalry stables will be only large enough
Ito accommodate the mules. It looks as
If the greater number of the horses will .
! have to be picketed out, as if they were
i already on the field. It is not yet known
i how many will come in the first install
' ment or how many will be kept at the
! post at one time, but it is expected that
the horses will be hurried on as rapidly
a. possible. "â -.- â 'â  'â¢
Lieutenant Colonel Maus, the new In
spector general of this department, paid
an official visit to the Presidio yesterday
and inspected all the camps and post
buildings. He found the camps clean and
well policed and the buildings in good con
dition. It was his first inspection since j
taking offlce. Â«Â»Â»_Â«_*

yesterday that upon the recommendation
of' Major General Shafter Will C. Tre
matne one of the attaches of the office of i
"the adjutant general of this department, *

provisional army now being formed by
the President. Lieutenant Tremalne has
been attached to the department head
quarters for a number of years and was
on the personal staff of General Shafter
during the Cuban campaign. He has not
yet been assigned to any regiment. Tre
maine was in the regular army before he
entered the adjutant general's office.

mining man and rancher, has been ap

CRUSHED UNDER TON OF ROCK.
SAUSALITO. July IS.â August Undo, a
workman employed in the quarry at Angel
Island, met with a horrible accident yes
terday while assisting in the loading of a
barge and received injuries of such a na
ture that he died this afternoon. The
unfortunate man suffered intensely from
the time the accident occurred, about 3
..'clock yesterday afternoon, until lie
passed away, and frequently prayed for
death to relieve him of his agony.
"Warring Doctors.
The war between the College of Phy
sicians and Surgeons and the Cooper .Col
lege and medical department of the Uni
versity over the division of wards in the
City and County Hospital was practically
ended at a meeting of the Board of Health
yesterday, when all the medical factions
were represented. The representatives of
the College of Physicians and Surgeons
decided to let Cooper and the medical de
partment of the University have flrst

the other two colleges four wards each.
him lustily blew his police whistle.
Officer Sylvester, seeing Crasshey dash
ing down the street and concluding that
he had committed some serious crime,
gave chase. -. yyf -'â â¢â .
After running several blocks Sylvester
finally overhauled Crasshey and placed
him under arrest. Williams appeared a
, few minutes later and ordered Sylvester
to place a charge of battery against his
prisoner. He declared that he had a:.
saulted him without provocation and
threatened to invoke the aid of the Mayor
in sending him to jail. =* ,--
Williams' loud tones attracted the at
tention of several hundred people, who
imagined that a murder had been com
mitted. On learning that the prisoner
had merely assaulted a corporal of police
they assailed the latter with cries of
"Lynch him!" "He's no good!" and
"He's a disgrace to the department!"
Evidently thinking that the crowd in
tended to assault him Williams sneaked
away. Subsequently he visited a restau
rant, where he had an oyster placed on
his injured optic in the hope that he
would be in a presentable shape to Dour
forth his woes into the ears of Mayor

BLACK DRAUGHT
HER DEATH POTION
Continued from First Page.
Hotel Waldorf-Astoria in New York
City.
She was left penniless but in some
way, possibly realizing on her jewels,
she secured funds with which to return
to San Francisco and arrived here three
weeks ago. She went at once to Bailey
and pleaded to be taken back, but dur
ing her absence he had made other ar
rangements; another fair one was rul
ing the hearth at 110 Jones street.
A few nights later after a whirl
across the Ellis-street divide, which
was interrupted only as often as the
absinthe . could be frozen. Florence
broke in on the peace and quiet at the
Jones street apartments with an idea
of doing harm to hersuccessor. The dis
turbance she raised was of such ample
proportions that she was ordered out
by the landlady and Bailey received an
ultimatum not to let it happen again.
Then drink got the upper hand. Flor
ence became melancholy and brooded
over her troubles almost constantly. Her
prosperous past was dead to her: she
had gone her pace and in eight 'hort
years had found the finish. Between
brooding and drinking she worked her
self into another frenzy and a few days
ago again went to Bailey's stable. She
found him just about to drive out and
seizing the carriage whip from its
socket she used it on him without
mercy:
Then she went home and took car
bolic acid.
Prompt work saved her life, and on
Friday last she was able to leave her
rooms. She telephoned to one of her
companions, Lil Nelson, and her
mother, forsaking Senator Bettman for
the night. The three left for the cele
bration at the Chutes. Their night was
one of drunken revelry and abandoned
gayety. Florence was almost feverish
in her high spirits; the melancholy that
had clung to her was drowned in a cold
i green bath.
*
Between 3 and 4 o'clock in the morn
ing she left her mother and the Nelson
woman without warning and took the
first car she could catch into town. Ar
rived at Market street, she made her
way rapidly to Bailey's rooms, where
she raised another disturbance. Bailey
came out to her and begged her to be
quiet. He said he would get a carriage
and they would find other rooms, and
she promised to wait there until he had
done so.
But, either doubting Bailey's good
faith or laboring under another fit of
melancholy, she broke her promise and
hurried out to her home and stole qui
etly in. Without rousing any one she
made her way to her room, where for
days she had kept concealed a bottle of
laudanum.
Her determination to suicide had not
come in a moment. Since she had been
deserted in New York she had thought
of it, and as her melancholy increased
the idea became so fixed in her mind
that it was always with her. Her let
ters indicated it, as did her conversa
: tion. Life to her was so cheap as to be
scarcely worth the taking.
But she took the draught, and an
hour or so later her almost lifeless body
was found dressed as she had returned
from her night at the Chutes.
To hush the matter up was the first
matter to which the attention of Sena
tor Bettman and his mistress, the dead
girl's mother, was turned. If it be
came known that she had suicided the
whole disgraceful story of the riotous
life at the Devisadero-street house
would transpire at the inquest.
Bettman decided that it would be best
to have the body taken at. once to the
Columbarium and there cremated, but
here the dead girl's brother. Royal Par
ker of Fresno, stepped in. He had
stood the disgraceful state of affairs for
years, he said, but he would not stand
any such cold-blooded scheme as Bett
man proposed. His sister's body should
be buried with that of his father in
the cemetery at Stockton, and this
Bettman, although the head of the
house, was compelled to assent to.
He went to the proper people, how
ever, and making use of his entreaties
and political pull induced them to de
cide that Florence Parker had died of
I dilation of the heart and kindred
j troubles.
I She was buried yesterday at Stock
ton.

THE EXAMINER'S OVERCOATS.
THE CALL sincerely hopes that the Oregon
volunteers, who are among the 'hardiest soldiers
fhat were furnished by .the northern part of the
United States, may not attempt to protect themselves
from the winds and the fogs incident to the climate
of San Francisco by wearing the underclothing or the
overcoats furnished by the Examiner. So far as we
are advised we are unaware that any of these articles
has ever become visible to the naked eye. But we can
assure the volunteers that, if they should materialize
under atmospheric or other influences, they will turn
out to be things of shreds and patches, without
warmth and open to all the cold and driving mists
that occasionally float through the Golden Gate.
The Government, the press and the people are
united in deep appreciation of the valor, the endur
ance -and the intelligent patriotism displayed by our
volunteer forces in the Philippines. The bright citi
zen soldiery of Oregon have deserved and have re
ceived conspicuous honors. But they did not require
the insolent pretensions of the Examiner to secure
for themselves ordinary protection against the
weather, for which there is the most ample provision
in the army regulations and in the Government stores
in San Francisco. Each of these representatives of
Northwestern devotion to our national institutions is
entitled to exercise his option by taking an overcoat
or the sum of $11 69, which represents its cost.
Many of them have preferred to save the money, and
have made other arrangements for their own com
fort and for their own health entirely satisfactory to
themselves. There is and there has been no red tape
that in any way obstructed or interfered with them.
No action of any kind by the President of the United
States or by General Miles, or by any department or
officer of the Government, outside of the usual rou
tine, was necessary to facilitate them in any precau
tionary measures they may have desired to take.
~- *â â¢ â¢'"..'-'_ 1 _1 T) â __
Th.c Examiner is well understood on the Pacific
Coast, and in its vulgar assumption of some mys
terious power it could exercise for the benefit of the
Oregon volunteers it has simply added one more il
lustration to the volume it has already produced of its
ineradicable delusions. Its entire stock in trade ap
parently consists of virulent egotism, displayed in
hysterical type. Each successive incident in its career
has been a phase of paresis. It offered a reward of
fifty thousand dollars for the discovery of the crim
inal who destroyed the Maine. It appointed a com
mission of its own to regulate the official representa
tives of the Government. It adopted a "national
policy." the essential point of which was the incor
poration of the Philippines as American territory and
of the Filipinos as our fellow citizens. It then pro
claimed an "internal policy," which still parades its
glaring absurdities at the head of its editorial page. It
has produced fabricated interviews with some of the
potentates of the earth, having both terrestrial and
spiritual functions, in which it pretended to deal with
them on the footing of an independent power.
The latest aspect of this extraordinary lunacy or
idiocy is the publication of editorial letters addressed
to President McKinley, usually signed by the pro
prietor of the Examiner, through which unread in
structions are conveyed to the Government. In this
category the absurd telegram about the overcoats is
included. The performance was interesting on ac
count of its grotesque absurdity. In the daily walks
of life examples of vanity or egotism are not uncom
mon, but it is rarely that those diseases are the only
characteristic features of a daily newspaper.
The Oregonian volunteers will not shiver in this
balmy climate, where popular enthusiasm alone would
almost keep them warm, but they would certainly find
the Examiner overcoats in the nature of wet blankets.
The Philadelphia Press, an acknowledged mouth
piece of the administration, says editorially that if the
allegations of the correspondents at \Janila are sus
tained by investigation Major General Otis will be
removed. The General would better begin packing
his trunks.
Friends of Superior Judge Murasky were some
what alarmed last week by the report that he had
Lung trouble. Their minds were considerably
eased when they discovered that he was only suffer

DYER LOYALTY.
CAPTAIN N. MAYO DYER has landed in Bos
ton and immediately indulged in an expression
of opinion and belief, to the effect that all anti
imperialists are traitors, and that the time has arrived
by his watch to suppress them. The captain lays
down the law to the effect that citizens who do not
support a national administration are disloyal. He
plunges into print up to where he parts his name, and
lectures the American people, who pay his salary, as
if they were Filipinos adjudged incapable of self
government.
His idea of our institutions has the trent of sim
plicity. The people owe loyalty to the President an.l
must support whatever the President is doing. When
the President says that acquisition of territory by con
quest is criminal aggression and opposed to our na
tional morality the people must say "amen!" When
the President changes, and spends eight hundred
thousand dollars a day in an attempt to acquire the
Philippines by conquest, and the facts are kept from
the people whose money is being spent in that ad
| venture, Captain Dyer insists that any opposing citi
| zen is a traitor, and this horse marine desires to sup
press him.
The logic of Captain Dyer is a twin to that of Dip
lomat John Barrett. According to it, when the Presi
dent said that conquest of territory was criminal ag
gression all the imperialists were traitors and should
have been suppressed, and the anti-imperialists were
loyalists. Then the President suddenly said "Wig
wag" and "Thumbs down," and the imperialists,
purged of treason, made faces at the disloyal anti
imperialists.
Captain Dyer has perhaps grown rusty on salt water
in respect to the nature of our Government and the
citizen's duty toward it. When he entered the navy
'he took an oath to support the constitution of the
United States and defend its principles and to obey
the orders of his superiors. The President of the
United States, commander-in-chief of the army and
navy, is Captain Dyer's superior officer, whose orders
he must obey. But the captain seems to think that he
is the superior of the plain tax-paying citizens, and
that they must obey him as he obeys the President.
This Nickel Neptune is in error. He may be sur
prised to learn that the American people do not take
an oath of loyalty and obedience to him or the Presi
dent. He seems to fancy that at some stage in the
proceedings every citizen takes an oath something like
this:
I do solemnly swear that I will true allegiance
and obedience render to Captain X. Mayo Dyer, and
in all matters relating to the policy of the National
Government, forsaking all others, will cleave to his
opinion until he changes it.
But this seadog is on the wrong trail. The only
oath of allegiance taken by the people cf this country
is to support the constitution. When they hear a
major general in our army declare that the constitu
tion is obsolete, and that imperialism has no use for it
nor the Declaration of Independence, they naturally
protest against a policy which requires repudiation of
every foundation principle of our Government. For
making and publishing this protest Captain Dyer
would have them punished as traitors, not to the con
stitution, nor to the Government, but to the Presi
dent!
Now, while it is true that a pious person over in
Oakland has announced that President McKinley de
rives his authority not from the people but from God
direct, and proves by texts running from early in
Genesis to late in Revelation, that the wholesale
slaughter of the Filipinos was being divinely planned
while the universe was chewing prehistoric peanuts at
the first matinee, and when the morning stars sang
together, and that Major McKinley was really nomi- j
nated in a celestial caucus and sprung on the Ameri- j
can people as a miracle, there be those who are ;
skeptical. The Kaiser and Captain Dyer are suffi- j
cient for talking partners in the scheme for running
the world by divine right.
The captain should be informed that our institutions
are like water. You may draw your hand edgewise
through it and there seems to be no resistance, but
hit it a flat blow and it is as unyielding as steel. He
and a few other military and civil fools are playing
with the principles of our Government. They seem
to be having all the fun, but when they get ready to |
deal a blow the unyielding work of the fathers will j
stand, and those who would destroy it will be shat

CROP PROSPECTS FOR THE YEAR.
rROM reports contained in the Crop Circular for j
June, issued by the United States Department of I
Agriculture, it appears there is to be a shortage
in the wheat output of the world and in the apple and
the peach crop of the United States. The outlook for
good prices for such farm products is therefore ex
cellent.
In regard to the apple crop the circular says: "In
the thirteen States having 3,000,000 or more apple
trees in bearing at the last census the condition on
June 1, as compared with the average June condition
for the last fifteen years, was as follows: New York.
1 above; Pennsylvania, 6 below; Michigan, 14 below;
Missouri, 2 above; Illinois, 8 above; Indiana, 5 above;
Kansas, 4 above; Kentucky, no difference; Tennes
see, 2 above; Virginia, 3 below; North Carolina, 4
below; lowa, ii below, and Maine, 31 below."
The peach crop, it is announced, will probably
come as near being a total failure as it ever will come
in a country of such vast extent and such varied cli
matic conditions as the United States. With the ex- \
ception of California, where the conditions indicate
from 75 to 95 per cent of a full crop, there is not a
State that has the promise of so much as two-thirds
of a normal crop; few look for even a half crop, and |
in many important peach-growing States there will be I
practically no crop whatever. In the last-named
category must be placed Pennsylvania, Delaware,
Georgia, Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, Alabama,
Tennessee 'and Kentucky!
Preliminary returns of the wheat crop for this
country show that of twenty States having 10,000
acres or more devoted to that product six report an
increase of acreage over that of last year amounting
in all to 245,000 acres, while fourteen report a de- I
crease aggregating 715,000 acres, so that there will be
a net decrease for the whole country of about 470,000
acres. The average condition of the crop, moreover,
is reported as but 91.4, as compared to an average of
100.0 at the corresponding season of last year.
Reports from foreign countries indicate a decrease
elsewhere in the crop. It is stated the Russian re
ports represent winter grain crops, both wheat and
rye, as almost destroyed by drought, by which the
spring grains also had been severely injured and
would soon be beyond help unless relieved by rain.
It is evident that the crop of bread grain for the em
pire as a whole cannot be a good one. notwithstanding
that for a few localities which have been heard from
the reports are generally favorable. It has even been
suggested that the crop may not exceed that of 1897.
A somewhat hotter showing is made for the crop of
France, which, next to Russia, is the largest and most
important wheat-producing country in Europe, but i
even there the yield is not expected to equal that cf |
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, WEDNESDAY,- JULY 19, 1899.
last year. An official estimate, issued May 10, reports
that while the area under wheat is about the same as
in the preceding season, the condition is 5 per cent
lower, which indicates the crop will be about 20,000,
--000 bushels less than that of 1898.
A British commercial estimate cited by the circular
tentatively puts the world's wheat crop, of 1899 at
2,504,000,000 bushels, against 2,748,000,000 bushels in
1898, a reduction of 244,000,000 bushels, or nearly 8.9
per cent. Another estimate makes a reduction of
352,000,000 bushels.
These estimates are of course largely matters of
speculation. It is as yet too early to determine with
anything like accuracy what the outcome will be.
They are based, however, on the best information the
Government can obtain, and are, therefore, valuable
as indications of the probabilities of the crops for the
year. The outlook as shown by them is encouraging
for California, and our farmers and orchardists may
reasonably expect a season of more than ordinary
prosperity, with good prices for both grain and fruit.
WHATEVER questions of law may be here
after raised in respect to the municipal assess
ment for the present fiscal year, the action of
the Board of Supervisors on Monday last, and espe
cially of its Rei Ã¼blican members, is a new and an
honorable precedent in the history of San Francisco.
The astute lawyers and manipulators who represent
the corporations may have cards up their sleeves, but
that will not alter the fact that, for once, a pledge has
been kept and at least an approach toward equality
in assessments secured.
The Call does not dispute the proposition that, in
the distribution of credit for this desirable result,
there are Democrats who are entitled to their legiti
mate share. But the brag of the Examiner and its
pretended claim that the substantial approach toward
justice that the completed equalization discloses is
due to the action of Assessor Dodge is unwarrantable.
While it is true that the Assessor raised the valuations
of the personal property of the Market Street Rail
way Company and of other corporations, it is equally
true that he carefully and unjustly preserved the dis
proportion between corporations and private citizens
that had so long existed. He was compelled to ad
mit that, in the case of ordinary property-owners, he
had adopted a percentage of from 75 to 90, while cor
porations had been appraised at from 50 to 60 per cent
of the market value of their bonds, franchises and
other property, and the only reason he could assign
for this discrimination was his fear that he might be
suspected of "cinching" propensities.
The Assessor's argument was as fallacious as the
boasting of the Examiner was absurd. The only true
rule is that of substantial equality before the law.
Corporations and individuals, in the theory of taxa
tion, are upon a level. Neither are entitled to the
slightest advantage over the other. Under any just
system of assessment, the value of all property, with
out reference to its ownership, should be fairly ascer
tained and an undiscriminating rate of percentage
adopted. But, if this precision is unattainable and if
some inequalities are inevitable, then aggregated and
swollen capital and not private citizens should be sub
jected to the highest rate.
The Examiner demands credit for its efforts to
elect Assessor Dodge. But it was owing to this par
ticular officer that the greatest inequalities were intro
duced into the assessment, and had not the Board of
Supervisors, so far as was practicable under existing
conditions, rectified this inequality and by its method
of equalization kept the entire valuation of property
within reasonable limits, not only would small prop
erty-owners have been sacrificed but the municipality
would have been placed at the mercy of the State.
The essential point to be observed is that a large
quantity of property that in former years has fraudu
lently escaped from any contribution to municipal ex- j
penditure has now been forced out of its seclusion,
and that while it is still relieved from a full share of
the public burthens, a long stride has been made
toward an honest interpretation of the constitutional
and statutory provisions on the subject of taxation. j
The corrupt politicians who have been used by the
Huntington monopoly and by other kindred organi- j
zations to cheat the average citizen and to buy ex
emption for their employers for once have failed.
Some preparations at least have been made for a com
plete trial of the merits of the new charter.
The year has marked the commencement of a new
era in municipal and in State politics, and in the prac
tical administration of the various departments of
government. Republican integrity in the Legislature
was^oo much for Dan Burns. Republican and Demo
cratic integrity in the Board of Supervisors overcame
all the machinations of the plotters of the Market
â¢Street Railway Company. Now there has been an
approximation toward justice in local taxation, for j
which also the Board of Supervisors, and not the Ex- I
aminer or Assessor Dodge, are to be commended.
The prospects of the Republican party in the ap- |
proaching campaign have been greatly brightened by â 
the events of the past few weeks.
AN EXPERIMENT WORTH TRYING.
AN association known as "The German House
wives' Society" has presented to the Municipal
Assembly of New York City a petition praying
that the city government undertake an official inves
tigation of the conditions of domestic service,' with the
object, as stated in the petition, of bringing about a
better understanding between mistress and maid.
The movement can hardly be called another step in
the direction of paternalism, for the paternal head of
a family is not charged with the solution of servant
girl problems. It is a tendency toward maternalism
in municipal affairs, and, that being something new in
civic development, the experiment is wortn trying â
at least it is worth trying on the other side of the
continent.
Something is needed just now to add to the gayety
of nations. Our comedies are dull, our farces are
coarse, our funny men have gone stale, and all the
humorists have climbed the chestnut tree. There
fore why not turn the Municipal Assembly of New
York loose to investigate the relations,* the duties and
the troubles that exist between the housewife and the
servant girl? The scheme is quite feasible and the re
sults are sure to be entertaining.
It would require no great amount of imagination
to construct a good plot for a comic opera out of
the proceedings of a committee of city authorities
gravely interfering between mistress and maid. It is
true the petition for such interference has come from
housewives, but it is safe to say that if it be under
taken the housewives as well as the servant girls will
turn up their noses at the masculine presumption, and
perhaps have hysterics if it be persisted in.
Nevertheless we repeat the thing is worth trying,
and the Tammany Aldermen are the very men to be
appointed to try it. The contest between- the tiger
and the woman is just the thing we need to enliven
the dullness of the summer season.

HOTEL THAT TRAVELS ON WHEELS.
Folds Up When Not In Use and Handled Like an Ordinary
Baggage Car.
ONE of the most remarkable of the recent inventions upon
which the Patent Office authorities have been called to
pass judgment in a traveling hotel, the designer of which
thinks he ha* filled a long-felt want by constructing a por
table habitation for traveling circuses or camping parties who
do not wish to be at the mercy of local hotel keepers.
The hotel on wheels is made, of aluminum, and is so con
structed as to fold up like a railroad car, and to appear, when
closed, to be an ordinary baggage car. When the stopping
place is reached and the travelers wish to camp for the night
the sides of the car are let down by means of a series of levers.
The inventor has divided his traveling hotel into, compart
ments, so that the party, if it be a large one, can be separated
LET PATRIOTS BE CONSISTENT.
Editor of The Callâ Sir: As an American of Irish birth I beg to express my
warmest sympathy with the views set forth in your editorial in The Call of
July 13 entitled "A Holy War."
Consistency, truth and justice permeate every paragraph of your excellent
article, which deals honestly and fearlessly with a vital questionâ a new "im
pending conflict" â the affairs of our country.
Nearly forty years ago a true Irishman, who subsequently won the laurels
of a Union general (Charles G. Halpine, known in letters as "Private Myles
O'Reilly"), with sad resentment from his patriotic heart penned the lines:
"Tear down the flaunting lie,
"' Half-mast the starry flag;
Insult no sunny sky
With hate's polluted rag."
The sentiments thus expressed (in the New York Tribune) were regarded
as disloyal, traitorous, etc., by many well meaning but misguided people of
that period. But to the millions who believed that human beings with immor
tal souls could not and should not be sold as chattels at the auctioneer's
block under the shadow of a flag claimed to be "the flag of the free," the ut
terance of the poet bore an entirely different significance.
The Call to-day, to its honor be it said, substantially enunciates the same
principle which the poet proclaimed to the confusion and shame of certain
demagogic politicians and orators of that period.
To peoples as well as individuals the truth is not always sweet and flatter
ing. On the contrary, it is often bitter and humiliating. In our heart of
hearts to-day we revere the loyalty, courage and unswerving patriotism of our
"gallant soldiers and sailors, whose matchless bravery on land and sea has
evoked the admiration of the world. But the glorious achievements of sol
diers and sailorsâ solemnly sworn to obedience â and the merits of the cause in
which a higher power uses and utilizes their prowess and daring are questions
entirely separate and distinct. What are the lessons of history to some of our
fellow-citizens who at the present time are essaying to mold public opinion
upon a subject which all thoughtful men must regard as a crucial test of our
nation's claims and standing as the friend and protector of liberty and human
rights? Alas, how applicable are the words of the illustrious Madame Roland:
"Oh, Liberty! Liberty! How many crimes are committed in thy name." '.'."fy
If some of my Irish friends and fellow countrymen who delight to indulge
in flights of vehement oratory upon the wrongs and sufferings of the land that
bore us could only see in the unquestionably brave and still unconquered Fili
pinos a picture of their own ancestors, likewise brave and liberty-loving, who
in the bogs and behind the sweet smelling hawthorne hedges of Ireland fought
to the death the troopers of Cromwell and the "bloody year" of '98, they, the
aforesaid friends and fellow countrymen, would for shame's sake change the
tone of their orations. Nothing seems worse in the speech, of a public man
than glaring inconsistency and an utter disregard of principle.
Shakespeare must have known of such a style of oratory when he wrote:
"What damned error, but some sober brow
Will bless it, and approve it with a text,
Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?"
The Rev. Mr. Hensons, the Whitelaw Relds and also certain" gentlemen
nearer home should carefully examine their "brows" and determine whethe:
or not they are of the "sober" type described by the immortal bard of Avon. :

EXTRAVAGANT
"BLUE BEARD"
AT THE TIVOLI
No hours of deep thought exhausted the
brain of the author when the libretto of
"Blue Beard" was building. In a merry
mood he sat him down and wrote â
and occasionally they rhymed. Hence it
ls not the beautifulest, most moving or
finest writ we have seen in a twelvemonth,
and withouten a bit of right good cook
ing by the cast it might breed Indigestion.
Old English comes to the pen by right of
environment, for the scenic artistâ
wizard! â has accomplished the feat of
showing us, under the minarets of Tur
key, the ancestraf piles of our British
ancestors in close and grotesque perspect
ive!' It is just possible that even ex
travaganzas can be a shade too extrava
gant. When there are so many clever
ways of being funny to choose from why
offend the eye? The third set is well
treated if a little startling. It is as clear,
flat, dry and unatmospheric as a picture
by Gerome, and makes a flne background
for the incongruous, inharmonious figures
that move across the stage. And they are
inharmonious. No color scheme seems to
actuate the grouping and grace and
rhythm lose their charm in the clash that
results. Even the lights are badly chosen.
At times they give one a sea-sick feeling.
All this ugliness is made the medium for
some really beautiful soli and choruses
and some exceedingly clever dancing and
specialty work. Miss Walker's song from
the balcony was so beautifully sung that
no one would suspect the metallic quality
that later work discloses in her voice.
She seems, however, a singer of experi
ence and an actress of no mean ability.
The couleurature in her voice, if of the
unfinished order, is agreeable and will
please the majority. Miss Myers sang
her song of "Jack" to spontaneous ap
plause and a well-deserved encore. Mr.
Pruette is "much less than kind" to him
self when he accepts the part of Sister
i Anne, but the audience finds him funny
in the various sections of the building, occupying, if they wish,
apartments en suite or a single room. The rooms are to be fitted
up in the modern style, with all conveniences, including elec
tric light, electric bells, electric cooking apparatus, and the
inventor is even working on a system that he thinks will en
able the occupants of the hotel to reach the upper story by
means of an electric eievator.
The furniture designed for the car is, of course, mostly or
the folding variety, and can be stowed away in a very small
compass when not in use. When the stopping place is reached
the car is to be detached from the train and taken to a con
venient siding, where there Is ample room for the spreading
of the sides and the elevation of the roof that form the hotel.
and perhaps this compensates for the sac
rifice. Mr. Stevens has ever a wav of
being amusing without effort and as Hans
Fritz Ibrahim the quality stands him in
good stead. So stupid are the lines given
him to speak that he gets his biggest
laughs by belaboring his lunch counter
victims (rather clever types by the wav)
with French loaves and custard pie's.
Given the right lines no one can make a
point better than Mr. Stevens. Why is
he not given them? Will not some one
with a trick for rhyme lend his intelli
gence to a worthy libretto? For the man
who does, nothing in this world will be
too good, and when he dies no cemetery
will be worthy of his remains.
Of the two dances "The Man and the
Maid" is by far the prettier and would
be better named "The Butterfly and the
Beetle."
Now a word as to coster songs. They
are a realm into which few may venture
with impunity and it does not subtract
from the value of the cast to say they
are not found on the Tivoli stage. Peo
ple who sing coster songs well usually do
nothing else. Mr. Branson was the only
one who caught their spirit and even in
his case another choice would have been
wiser. The extravaganza, thanks to the
gift of enthusiasm, is playing to large
houses and much applause, but will be
withdrawn at the close of the week to
give place to "Wang." in which Mr.
Stevens does excellent work.

cf Wide Experience. Will Col
lect and Arrange the Im
portant Displays.
The California Paris Exposition Com
mission is doing its utmost to arouse
farmers ami yineyardists to a full appre
ciation of the vast advertising possibili
ties . of the coming Paris Exposition.
When Californians realize that half the
space allotted to the whole United States
for a horticultural display has been given
to California and over two-thirds of the
viticultural space has also been assigned
to the Golden State they will probably
make a concerted effort to send the best
that the State produces to France and
see that not an inch of space is wasted.
The commission has established perma
nent headquarters in the Occidental Ho
iel. Circulars have been sent^to ill the
prominent growers in the State, and
while many are arranging for space, the
response is not what it might be.
The collection and installation of bev
erages is a. part of the agricultural ex
hibit of this country. which by law is to
be prepared by the Secretary of Agricui-.
ture. Commissioner General Peck and the
Secretary of Agriculture have -mated
C. R. E)odge as a director of agricul
ture, and Dr. H. W. Wiley, chief chemist
of the Department of Agriculture-, has j
been appointed expert in cha-rse of the ;
collection of the exhibit. Dr. Wiley has
arranged for the collection of the Cali
fornia, display by the California Paris Ex
position Commission: and this commis
sion has appointed W. H. McNeil its '
agent to represent Dr. Wiley.
This work is thoroughly familiar to Mr.
McNeil. For many years he had charge
of the exhibit in th*r rooms of the Viti
cultural Commissioners and was selected
by the California World's Fair Commis- I
tion to take charge of the viticultural fea- i
tures of the California display at the Co
iumbian Exposition. The importance of j
the concessions at the coining Paris Ex
position is concisely stated in one of the]
circulars as follows:
Now is the time for the viticultur
:.-: o: California to make a record.
France having been the home of the
wine industry for ages, comparisons
al! over the world are made by the
French standard, therefore at the
Paris Exposition of 1900 is the oppor
tunity for California wines to get the
! world's recognition. The wines of
California have been assigned suffi
cient space by the United States Com
missioners to have them represented
as never before in any foreign coun
try. Every time California has made
a viticultural exhibit the State has
made a lasting impression and gained
increased honor and reputation.
The horticultural and agricultural dis
plays will be in the hands of L. A. Em
lay, who is well acquainted with the pro
ducers of the State. In I>C<3 he was se
lected as flrst assistant to Mr. Wells, then
superintendent of the agricultural and
horticultural departments of the World's
Fair at Chicago. When Mr. Weils re
signed. Mr. Emlay was placed in harge
of that department in both the national
and State buildings, and performed his
duties most creditabiv.

DEATH OF CAPTAIN BUCKLEY
â¢
INSANE WHEN HE ACCIDENT
ALLY SHOT HIMSELF.
Captain Balch of the John A. Briggs
Narrowly Escapes Meeting
Death by Drowning in
Delagoa Bay.
â¦
The steamer Portland, which arrived
from St. Michael yesterday, brought down
the remains of E. Towhill, a young San
Franciscan, who sought a fortune and
found death. He left here two years ago
and died from typhoid fever in Dawson
last February. A. L. Tracy, who returned
on the steamer, is in charge of the body.
The Portland brought considerable news
from the whaling fleet. So far it has been
a bad year, as very few whales have been
seen. The Narwhal, xielvedere, Bowhead
(the Norwegian steamer purchased and
commanded by Capta.n Cook) and Jean
ette have each taken one whale. All the
others are clean. Besides these, the Jean
ette had 7000 pounds of trade bone, so her
captain has no kick coming.
The death of Captain Buckley of the
steam whaler William Baylies was a very
sad affair. He had been under a severe
mental strain for several weeks and his
mind was somewhat unhinged. He could
not sleep at night and became subject to
hallucinations. He thought his crew was
talking about him behind his back and
sometimes he heard voices in the air.
From i to 9 a. m. of May 24 he was in
the crow's nest watching for a whale.
When he descended to the deck he said he
could hear a band playing In the air.
The William Baylies was fast to the ice
near Diomede Island when the accident
happened. At 8 p. m. on May 24 Captain
Buckley and Mate Cuttle were sitting in
the cabin, when the captain started and
said some one was trying to force his way
in, and ordered the mate to lock the door.
The mate had nearly all the keys In the
ship on a ring, as he had locked up a,
the guns and dangerous things for fear
Buckley might do himself some harm.
To humor tne captain, Cuttle took the
ring with the keys out of his pocket and
tried to find one that would fit the cabin
door. He failed and went to look for a
key that would fit, leaving the ring on
the cabin table. This was the captain's
opportunity. lie was conlident some one
was entering the cabin to kill him, s<>.
seizing the keys, he lilted one to the lock
on the lazarette and opening the batch
lowered himself down.
The letter that brought the particulars
down then goes on to say: "Captain
Buckley was clean out of his mind by
this time. He still thought he was bein?
followed, and. seeing a gun behind some
stores, he got down on his belly and'
grasping it by the muzzle pulled 11 to
ward him. The gun went off and blew
the top of his head away. His right hand
was ail powder-stained through being so
close to the muzzle. It was a gross piece
of. carelessness on the part of whoever
put that gun away loaded We buried
Captain Buckley on St. Lawrence island
ana Chief Officer Cuttle will take the
steamer north. The. other officers went
up a step and Charley Boyle has been
made fourth mate and Ike Smith a boat-
Fteerer. We are now bound for the Arctic
and 1 hope we will make a good catch."
Captain Balch, the well-known master
of the American ship John A. Briggs. ha I
a very narrow escape from losing his life
in Delagoa Bay last month. As It was
he lost all his money, the ships regis!
and all her papers, and is likely to have
some trouble at his next port of call in
consequence.
The John A. Briggs went from here to
Chemainus last December and there
loaded 1,483,216 feet of lumber for Delagoa
Bay. Captain Balch discharged his cargo
after considerable delay and then cleared
his ship for Sydney. N. S. W. At the lat
ter port she is to load coal for Honolulu
and from Honolulu will bring sugar to
San Francisco. ; y . 7
After clearing his ship Captain Balch
fot into his boat and started to gr aboard,
'our of his sailors were rowing, but aa
it was blowing very hard they did not
make a great deal of headway. Suddenly
a squall struck the boat and over she
went. It was dark, but by good luck the
captain and four men succeeded In get
ting on the bottom of the boat and then :
for an hour they hung on. chilli to the
bone; and thinking each moment would

THE KISSINC BUG
i Is Less Dangerous Than Some Every-
day Evils Which Beset the
Average Mortal.
A LOCAL PHYSICIAN'S OPINION ON AN ALL-
IMPORTANT SUBJECT. ,
Dr. Holsman. who recently arrived
from London to become a member of
I the staff of the well-known specialists,
! Dr. Meyers & Co., scoffs at the stories
; of the "kissing bug. "In my opinion,"
j said the doctor, "we will hear very lit-
j tie more of this osculating beetle. If
I people would pay more attention to
i their everyday life, and especially to
! the remedies -which the average ph.- -
-; sician prescribes, they would be hap-
i pier, healthier and live longer. Too
l many mineral drugs are being dis-
! pensed. Thousands of men to-day are
; having their stomachs utterly ruined
i and their constitutions undermined by
l deadly drugs.
"Dr. Meyers & Co.'s staff of physi-
cians, of which I am now a member,
never dispense mineral or other dan-
gerous medicines. In curing men of
private and other diseases, and in re-
storing victims of lost manhood, we use
nothing but the extracts of buds,
barks, berries, roots, plants, gums,
fruits and flowers."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. July 18.â stock market con
tinued dull and neglected, almost to the point
of stagnation to-day. Prices drifted quite aim
lessly up and down except in a few stocks
which were influenced by individual causes and
net changes for the most part were very small.
The opening showed some slight animation and
higher prices in sympathy with London, which
had advanced Americans before the opening
here and seemed to take the more cheerful view
of the general outlook. The money market
there was reported rather easier in tone, but
the Bank of England continued to do prac
tically all of the money lending at a rate
well above its official minumum rate of dis
count, and sterling exchange at Continental
centers showed additional sharp advances. In
New York, money was rather easier In tone,
but the rate still continued above those at
some other domestic centers, so That the sterl
ing exchange market, though hard, was not
quotably higher. It is intimated that money
rates may be held up in New York to prevent
an outflow of gold and the additional sugges
tion is heard that Chicago may supply London
with some gold on direct movement. There are
increasing offerings of Chicago funds in New-
York. Statements of railroad earnings con
tinue to break previous records, St. Paul lead
ing to-day on returns for its second July, with
an increase of f 231.532 over last year. To-day's
recovery in Brooklyn Transit amounted to two
points net and in Metropolitan Street Railway
to Is. withstanding the favorable inci
dents, the local stock market showed no dis
position to follow London's early lead and the
opening gains were soon lost. The only move
ments of any Importance were in Isolated
stocks, mostly industrials. Sugar and Manhat
tan showed early depression which was not
entirely overcome in the case of the latter,
though the former shows a small net gain.
American Smelting rose at one time 2*4 and
General Electric Is. but both reacted a. point.
New York Air Brake rose 6 points and then
dropped 11. The Tobacco stocks came into late
demand and gained from 1$ to 2s. the latter
Continental Tobacco common. Rubber pre
ferred, leather preferred, Tennessee Coal, Tin
Plate, Federal Steel, People's Gas and a few
other stocks had periods of Strength. New
York Central more than recovered yesterday's
decline and some firmness was manifest
among the Grangers. Pacifies and Trunk
lines, but .the coalers, Southwestern and
Southern stocks showed a slightly yielding dis
position. The whole day's business footed up
only a little over a quarter million shares and
Brooklyn Transit. Sugar and Manhattan ab
sorbed a large proportion of this.
The bond market was also very dull and price
changes were small and mixed as in stocks.
United States 3s coupon declined 'â (, and the
old 4s registered $, while the old 4s coupon ad
vanced $ In the bid price.
The total sales of stocks to-day amounted to
262.643 shares, including: American Smelting.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
i CHICAGO, July 18.â Wheat opened weak at [
I 71@71ftc for September, which was ft@ftc un
| der yesterday's close. Fine weather every- ,
I where, lower cables and heavy receipts were
the chief influences at work in the market.
i Long wheat was thrown on the market in
; great quantity. September touched 7" 7 ,c im
j mediately after the opening. This was put '
I rice and buying against these privileges ab- j
i sorbed the bulk of offerings. Shorts covered !
! freely on the decline and the market gradu
i ally rallied to 71% c. On the bulge the demand
' slackened again and September reacted to 71c.
Then the holders of puts made a second turn, I
j and this time it held until the close, which ;
' was at 7: : i <; 71% c, a net loss of only ftc. Pri
: mary receipts to-day were 1,120,000 bushels,
compared with 427. bushels the correspond-
Ing day of last year.
Corn ruled weak on heavy liquidation, fine ;
weather and sympathy with wheat. The close
was at a net loss of ft* for September.
; Oats ruled dull but remarkably steady. Sep- ]
! tember closed a shade lower.
Provisions showed remarkable strength i
: throughout, in spite of a weakness in the j
: grain markets. Continued cash demand for
I both domestic and export purposes stimulated
i outside speculative buying. Added to this was
I an advance of 10Â®15c for hogs at the yards.
: There was a slight recession early on profit '
j taking, but packers bought freely on th* de-
I cline and caused a rally, which was still in
I progress at the close. September pork closed
i 15c higher and ribs and lard gained lie each. â

DRIED FRUITS, NUTS AND RAISINS.
After a long season of neglect Prunes are
waking up and business in them is decidedly
better Old crop lots are being taken up and
quotations for some sizes of the new crop have
already been established. There is an active
demand from Europe at 6'ic for 40-50' c, sftc for
50-60's and 4ftc per lb for 60-70's Of the new
crop in bags The European demand for
Prunes promises to be sharp this year, ..wing
to the partial failure of the French and Servian
crops. The California crop will be less than a
full crop, but will run to large sizes, and from
present Indications the Prune growers will real
ize large returns -this year.
Sale of new Nonpareil Almonds at 10c.
There is a very fair demand for new Honey,
which is not coming in very freely as yet
All new fruits are firm and in demand, with
a decided upward tendency. This will be a j
great dried fruit year. ... .

HIDES, TALLOW, WOOL AND HOPS.
Hides and Hops show no new features. The
latter are In demand, but growers decline to
contract at current bids.
. A local house says of Wool: "There Is noth
ing specially new to report in our local Wool
market. Choice Northern Wool is coming for
ward and finds ready sale at full figures. Most
of the Wool from the middle counties, as well
as from th- coast and the San Joaquin Val- ;
lev, has been marketed. Oregon Is sending i
down a liberal share of Its Wool clip, whicn
is being bandied by scourers. A limited quan- !
tity of Valley Oregon is being received, but j
Just yet these coarse Wools are not In demand. :
but we look for a good market for them In the j
fall. A few parcels of Southern Coast Lambs'
Wool have been received, but they do not at- I
tract attention. On the whole the outlook for
Wool Is as good as could be wished for."

LEATHERâ A local circular says: "Some
lines of Leather have been comparatively quiet,
but the general leather trade can be quoted as
entirely satisfactory. It may be said that there
is too small a margin between the raw material
and the finished product, and the tanners are
now laying in stocks of very high-priced hides,
which will show a loss when any reaction in
the market occurs. The real market has been
in harness and skirting and heavy sole Leather.
Large quantities of harness and skirting are
being shipped to the West and Southwest,
where California Leather, owing to its superior
quality finds a ready sale at fair prices. Sole

SECRET CONTRACT IS
BROUGHT TO LIGHT

J. BLAIR,
W. S. CLARK.
Extract from a political contract.
Oakland Oflice San Francisco Call,
SOS Broadway, July 18.
The secret deal leading up to the un
seemly row between the Supervisors and
Coroner Mehrmann has been laid bare. It
shows one of the most remarkable
schemes to profit by the county's mu
tilated dead that was ever brought into |
public notice. Not till to-day was it
known how a public offlce and the emol
uments and perquisites can be bartered
and sold, the price, of course, always
having to be paid from the public treas
ury.
It has long been known that there was
a dark secret story behind all the political
trouble in the county government. Yes
terday Dr. Mehrmann showed the animus
existing on both sides, and to-day every
body felt free to talk and took advantage
of the freedom.
Three weeks after Coroner Mehrmann's
election Messrs. Blair and Clark, two Sac
ramento undertakers, appeared in Oak
land and gave out that they had money to
Invest ln business. They approached
James McCarthy, a local undertaker, and
showed him what purported to be a con
tract between them and Dr. Mehrmann
setting forth that In consideration of $5000
the Coroner-elect would establish the
Morgue where the two men decided to lo
cate in business. . irk and Blair con- .
suited with McCarthy, with the result that
It was agreed that the three should go ,
into business on ;i basis of JSOiX* as capital. i
McCarthy was to provide handsome quar
ters for the Morgue to represent his $6000
in the capital. He leased two stores, en
gaged a deputy, contracted for an ex
pensive dead wagon from the Bast cost
ing $800, and on January 1 was all pre
pared to enter, upon the Morgue business.
Messrs. Clark and Blair were to put Into
the business $3000 and were to be credited
with ?,'*""" as capital on the strength of the
deal they declared they had made with
Dr. Mehrmann. and which they gave as
surances was transacted in good faith at
a local bank. As New Year's day ap
proached (the time tiie Coroner was to
take office* Messrs. Blair and Clark were
not quite so positive thai they wanted to
ratify their partnership with McCarthy;
notwithstanding the fact that all their
advertisements .>. re out, that they had

some dead-wagon with "Blair, McCarthy

ready for the opening of ; .'- new Morgue.
Many conversations were held as to the
manner in which the $5000 which Clark
and Blair alleged they had paid Dr. Mehr
mann was to; come back to the firm. The
records of the dead for vera! years past
â were carefully gone over, and it was
agreed that in consideration of the growth
of Oakland and the certain increase of
morgue business owing to it being a rail
road town, the figures of Dr. Baldwin's
administration should be the basis of the
new deal in th* traffic of dead bodies.
Dr. Baldwin's figures showed that he
held 175, 185. 16! and 19.8 inquests during
his four ears In office. This was figured
out as supplying an average of sixteen

ALBERTA SWAN THE BRIDE OF
REV. A. E. HETHERINGTON.
Sacks of Gold Dust for Wedding Gifts
and Rice at 35 Cents Per
Pound Was Not Too Cost
ly to Throiv.
OAKLAND. July 18.â Particulars have
.-just been received by friends here of the
marriage of Miss 8. Alberta Swan of
Fruitvale to Rev. Albert E. Hetherington,
which nappy event took place at Dawson
City on June 20, Rev. Dr. Grant, a Pres
byterian minister, officiating, assisted by
Rev. James Warren.
Among the wedding presents, according
to the account, was a sack of gold dust
and a roll of greenbacks to the amount of
$235; The bride also received some very
pretty nuggets. A great throng saw the
bridal couple off on their wedding trip at
the wharf, and though rice costs 33 cents
a pound this indispensable feature was
not omitted.
The bride is the daughter of Mrs. 6. M.
Swat: formerly of High street. Fruitvale.
Last February sho accompanied her moth
er, brother and sister to Dawson City.
The groom is a graduate of the Manitoba
College of Toronto, Canada, and is of the
Methodist denomination.
Buggies and Bicycles Affected.
ALAMEDA, July 18.â The City Trustees
may try to compel every vehicle in town
to carry a lantern after dark. Bicyclists
have been forced to do this on nights
when the nioon did not shine. Recently
an effort "was made to force the wheel
men to carry lights every night in- the
year, and City Attorney Taylor was in
structed to draw Up an ordinance on
those lines. He offered it last night, but
with it was a written opinion that the
ordinance would not stand the test of law,
as It was plainly class legislation. The
Trustees concluded that they would make
every vehicle In the city flash a light
after the sun goes down, or let the wheel
men go as they are at present.
Struggle Over a Girl.
OAKLAND, July 18.â There is to be a
bitter struggle in the courts over the pos
session of little Florence Beaver, who a
year ago was placed in the charge of Mrs.
Carrie Judd Montgomery at Beulah. To
day the father filed a petition for letters
of guardianship over his own girl In op
position to the petition for letters recently
filed by Mrs. Eva M. Beagole, who
adopted the child some months ago.
Beaver charges that Mrs. Beagole is
cruel to the child and an Improper person
to have charge of her.
I Inquests a month, of which it was esti
mated twelve would come to the Morgue.
For the removal of these twelve bodies
â  the sum of |60 was credited to the Morgue.
It was estimated also that a Berkeley
undertaker would be glad to pay $20 a
month for his share of the Morgue busi
ness, while Alameda was considered good
â  for $15 per month. With mileage, inspec-
I tion of dead bodies, etc.. it was calcu
lated that the Morgue proprietors could
depend on $104 a month, which average
just $5000 for four years. It was als,, fig
ured out that a large percentage of all
private business resulting from accidents
would naturally be left with the firm con
ducting the Morgue; and. again, the
amount of profit to be derived from bury
ing Indigents was also a factor.
The agreement entered into between
Messrs. Mehrmann. Clark, Blair A Mc-
Carthy was not for the whole county.
It only covered such business as is In
cluded between the bay, the estuary .and
the San Leandro bridge. This left the
Coroner free to deal with all the terri
tory east of San Leandro. Including the
many accidents at the Tesla mines, in
any way he might see fit.
As January 1 approached the deal fell
through. McCarthy could not understand
the peculiar manner in which Blair and
Clark were acting, and finally he refused
to have anything whatever to do with the
deal. Then a most remarkable Incident
occurred. An attempt was made to In
duce a member of the Board of Super
, visors to take up the Interests of Blair
and .Clark and to join the partnership:
with McCarthy, it was represented to
the Supervisor that he could purchase the
contract with the Coroner-elect at its face
value of $5000 and share in the profits ac
cruing from the Morgue. Attorney George
Reed was consulted on the general prop
-1 osition of a Supervisor having a financial
Interest in the Morgue, and he quoted the
law on the subject, which effectually pre
vented any such deal from being consum
mated.
On the Ist of January Coroner Mehr
mann announced that the Morgue would
remain where it had been for the past
four yearsâ with Albert Brown. This ne
cessitated all kinds of explanations. Dr.
Mehrmann telling McCarthy that he had
made a more factory deal with Al
bert Brown than in- could make with
Blair. McCarthy & Clark, a firm, the
members of which he feared were not
dwelling together in harmony.
After the Coroner decided not to place
the Morgue with the new firm, '.'lark re
turned to Sacramento, takinr the eon
: tract with him. It is said that the con
j tract as it stands Is a legal basis for a
| claim against Coroner Mehrmann for $104
' per month on the part of McCarthy, who
.' signed it In good faith, and who never
consented to its revocation.
Some time later there was a scene on
I the street. Coroner Mehrmann and Mr.
McCarthy met. It was rumored that a
' gun was exhibited. This is denied, but
It is known that there was a short con
versation. ,:â -â â _
"If you breathe a word of what has
transpired I'll smash your head," said Dr.
Mehrmann.
"And I'll use my boot on you," said
McCarthy.
Everybody connected with the political
: scandal says there are yet other sensa
tions to be exploited.

VICTIM A PIONEER RESIDENT
OF ALAMEDA.
Wandered Away From Camp at
Boulder Creek and "Was Found
in a Dying Condition Two
Days Later.
*
ALAMEDA, July IS.â Mrs. Elizabeth
Ham of 2002 Pacific avenue, a lady past
the allotted three-score and ten, was lost
last Sunday night in the Santa Cruz
Mountains near Boulder Creek, and was
not found by the rescuing party until late
yesterday afternoon. She was .discovered
In a deplorable condition about four miles
from Boulder Creek and it -is feared she
has suffered so from exposure and fright
that she may not recover.
The aged lady has been camping near
Boulder Creek with her son-in-law and
daughter, Mr. and Mrs. John P. Forbes,
of 123 Albion avenue, San Francisco, and
Mrs. Thomas Payzer of Alameda. On
Sunday morning she decided to take a
walk into the hills and Insisted that she
might go alone. The other members of
the party consented only after she prom
is. not to go very far.
When the morning passed and Mrs.
Ham did not return to camp Mr. and Mrs.
Forbes became anxious for her welfare
and began a search. No trace of her
could be found. A searching party was
organized in the afternoon and a sys
tematic hunt was instituted. Fifty men
tramped the hills through the redwoods
all night with lanterns and torches, but
no trace of Mrs. Ham was found. It was
scarcely believed that she could have
wandered more than a mile from the
camp and the ground for that radius was
gone over and over again without result.
Mrs. Forbes, her daughter, was frantic
with fear for her mother's safety.
Late yesterday afternoon some of the
searchers found the lost woman in a
densely wooded canyon about four miles
from camp, She was lying under a clump
of underbrush, too exhausted and bewil
dered to give an account of herself. Sue
had to be carried back to Boulder Creek
on an improvised litter.
Mrs. Ham has since remained In a semi
conscious condition, unable to give an ac
count of her trying experience during the
time Â»he wandered in the mountains. The
exposure and fright which she suffered
were so great that her condition ls seri
ous and it is feared she may not recover.
Mrs Ham is a pioneer resident of Ala
meda. Her son, 'hail*-.- Ham. is* a teach
er in the Polytechnic High School, San
Francisco.
EMPTIED HIS GUN AT

AT THEIR WORK.
One of the Intruders Supposed to Be
Badly Wounded While Making
His Escape.
The residence of Hoy Smith nt 765 Capp
street was entered at 1 o'clock yesterday
morning by two burglars, who gained ad
mission by raising the kitchen window.
The noise made by the intruders awoke
Smith, and on listening he came to the
conclusion that there were some parties
In the house who had no right to be there.
Jumping out of bed, he donned some
clothing and hurriedly seized his shotgun,
which was within convenient reach, and
proceeded to explore the premises. On
arriving at the kitchen he was confronted
by two men, who were at work packing
up such articles as they thought would
be useful to them in their line of business.
The burglars beat a hasty retreat
through the window, which tuey had left
open for that purpose, and Smith took
a shot at them as they went out. One
of the men gave a yell of pain and rolled
over several times cursing and swearing
rind saying that he was shot. An ex
amination of the fence and the ground
where the man fell showed that it was
covered with blood and that Smith's aim
was good. In the meantime, however,
the burglars got away.

CALIFORNIA TO HAVE A

California is to have a new medical so
ciety. This was definitely decided last
night at a meeting of a committee ap
pointed for. the purpose of considering the
; advisability of such action in the office
of Dr. D. a. Hodgehead. The members
of the committee are Its. C. F. Buckley,
W. F. MoNutt; S. F. Long. C, H. Rosen
thal. J. A. Miller, Winslow Anderson and
D. A. Hodgehead of San Francisco and
B. 7.. Henderson of Napa and E. W. King

Or. Buckley presided and it was the
sense of the committee that a new society
should at once be formed, to be Incorpor
ated as soon as practicable, the name of
the society to be the California Medical
Association. It was also decldede that the
new society should conform to the code
of Ethics of the American Medical Soci
ety and Instead of issuing an annual vol
ume to issue a monthly publication, the
subscription to which, together with the
membership fee in the association to not
exceed $3 a year. It is proposed to hold
the first annual meeting in October next
and to meet In that month each succeed
ing year. â '"'--. _- yy.
The committee will report its conclu
sions in the matter to the San Francisco
Clinical Society, which is the instigator
of the movement, to-night and it is ex
pected that the necessary steps to carry
through the plan will be at once taken.
The movement to organize a new State

a Meeting at Healds

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, July 18.â Santa Clara
County grape growers and wine mak
ers are almost unanimous in accepting
the proposition of H. J. Crocker, presi
dent of the Winemakers" Corporation,
to enter into contracts to buy the en
tire grape crop for the next seven years
at $14 per ton. Nearly all the viticul
turllsts have already signed cards
agreeing to this, and it is expected the
rest of them will do so in a few days.
At a meeting of growers and wine
men held in Champion Hall, this after
noon, they were unanimous in this re
spect. About seventy-five of the most
prominent vineyardists in the county
were present. E. S. Guppy presided as
chairman, and A. Barstow acted as sec
retary. Many thousands of acres of
vines were represented, although not
one-third of those favoring Crocker's
proposition were present. Among those
present were: D. M. Delmas, P. Sala
zar of Livermore, Peter Ball. John Sni
der, George B. McKee, J. D. Williams.
j Alex Montgomery, W. B. Rankin and R.
T. Pierce.
E. S. Guppy stated that the object of
1 the meeting was to obtain the senti
! ment of winemen and growers in regard
> to the offer of H. J. Crocker to enter
| into contract to buy grapes at $14 per
! ton for seven years. He said this was
seemingly a good price and would pay
12 per cent on a $250 valuation. He
I stated that Crocker would distribute
the product among the various winer
-1 ies. All will be benefited by selling
! their grapes at the figure named and it
! will enhance the value of vineyards
' from 30 to 40 per cent. This would
benefit growers greatly and enable
: them to get better advances on their
crops. _
It was stated that in Sonoma County
growers had contracted to sell their
grapes for $12 per ton before Crocker's
, offer was made and that Southern
California growers had contracted at
$11 and $I*. , a
D M. Delmas favored Crocker s offer.
11. "considered $14 cash per ton on deliv
ery was very good, much better than he
had received during the last seven or
eight years. J. H. Henry was of the
â same opinion. Other growers spoke
along the same lines. Mr. Guppy said
that Crocker's offer would result In
good to all the viticultural interest .if
the State. Grapes bought by Crocker
' will be delivered to the various winer
, ies in county for pressing and most
likely to the winery nearest the grower.
W. B. Rankin, a large wine maker
I and grower, favored the offer made by
Crocker and said it would not hurt
I wine men. Grapes for the last ten years
; have averaged $10 per ton. The vine
var.lists will not replant nor care for
their vineyards. At $14 per ton grow
ers 'an afford to plant resistant stock.
Something must be done to save the
vineyards. The wineries are a second
ary consideration, and If the vineyards
are not saved they will all be turned
Into barns.
Most of the growers of Alameda
County will favor Mr. Crocker's propo
sition. Meetings of growers to take
action will be held In about a week. ,
A letter was read from H. Bendel, a
i fruit packer and fruit grower, urging
! the grape growers and wine makers to
! sign the contract with Crocker. All
those present who had not yet signed
the agreement did so. The following
i resolution was unanimously adopted:
"Resolvedâ That we, the grape grow
ers and wine makers of Santa Clara
County, heartily approve of the propo
sition of Henry J. Crocker to buy our
grapes for the next seveji years at $14
I a ton. being fully convinced that the
j said proposition, if carried out, is the
! most advantageous that could be ad
. vanced for the interests of grape grow
> ers and wine makers of this county and
j of the entire State."
Committees have been appointed to
! canvass the various sections and see
â  that all wine men and growers sign.
HEALDSBURG, July 18.â The follow

â â¦ â
MANAGER MULLER REFUSES TO
MAKE A STATEMENT.
â¦
Hagy Declares That He Is Not Short
the Amount Charged and That
Muller Has Given
Him Away.
â¢â â
Leonard A. Hagy, bookkeeper of the
Winchester Arms Company, is said- to be
$1100 short in his accounts to the com
pany and has been discharged. The
amount of the shortage is stated to have
been charged to the account of E. H.
Ladd. Rudolphe Muller, the manager of
the company, when called upon and asked
for a statement, refused to say anything,
except that Hagy had left the employ-,
ment of. the company. Beyond this he
would not give out anything in the way
of a statement. He said that he would
"not throw stones at a dog that was
down," but beyond this he would not
make any statement.
Hagy was seen last night by a Call cor
respondent. At tirst he was loth to dis
cuss his shortage, claiming that he knew
nothing whatever about it; but finally
concluded to give his side of the story.
"I admit," said he. "that there was a
little difference in the figures ot the Ladd
account, and that led to the severing of
mv connection with the Winchester Arms
Company. When I left, Mr. Muller the
manager, promised me that I would not
be punished and that the difficulty would
not be mad*, public. I do not think he has
kept faith with me.
"The eleven hundred dollar figure of the
Ladd account is not correct; the difference
does not come un to that amount. Re
garding the statement that 1 spent the
money at the horse races and coursing
matches 1 have nothing to say. Mr. Mul
ler promised me faithfully he would say
nothing about this affair, and 1 cannot
understand how it got out."
Hagy has been connected with the Win
chester Arms Company as bookkeeper and
cashier for several years. A few days
ago the manager. Mr. Muller, looked over
the ledger and found a balance of SHOO
charged to Ladd & Co. Muller visited
Ladd and requested a settlement. Ladd
laughed at the amount asked for and said
the balance he owed the Winchseter peo
pie did not exceed $40. Bookkeeper Hagy
was taxed With the discrepancy, and ad
mitted, so it is state*], that he had been
holding out small amount.- from the firm
for some months and charging them to
the Ladd account. .
Hagy is a prominent local Native Son,
being a past president of Halcyon Par
lor ' He was appointed by Chairman
Brick of the Board of City Trustees a
member of the Dewey monument commit
tee to represent the Native Sons. He was
i married about two years ago to Miss Eva

mittee of the arbitration committee of the

on the part of Great Britain and other
powers.

OUR BLANCHE IS NOT
TIM FRAWLEY'S BRIDE
ACTRESS DENIES THE SOFT IM
PEACHMENT.
Manager Attributes It All to Corson
Clarke's Dyspepsia, Which He
Fears Has Affected
His Mind.
There is no legal reason why Blanche
Bates should tack on the name of Fraw
ley to her signature.
She says she is not Mrs. Frawley, Fraw
ley Bays she la not Mrs. Frawley, and as
they nre the two people who are in the
best position to know their statements
should be accepted as final. Our Blanche
took the report of her marriage to her
manager in her own charming, sunny
way. If she was annoyed she did not
show it. only laughed and exclaimed,
"Ridiculous; absurd!'!
Frawley, on the contrary, was vexed at
the silly report; not on his own account,
but because of Miss Bates.
"It's annoying for a woman," said the
gallant manager, "to have a lying report
of that kind circulated about her. Corson
Clarke's aggravated stomach trouble has
probably gone to his head. That is the
only wav I can account for it."
Mies Bates explains the slander by
Clarke's desire to gel his name before
the public. "There is nothing he could
say of himself, so he stood sponsor for
lies about others," said Miss Bates.
So the story of the manager wedding his
star is not true, nor is there any possi
bility of it ever being true, for the man
ager declared: "1 shall never marry. Im
too much of a crank to make any woman
! happy. And 1 respect woman too highly
| to link her fate with mine."

Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA. July 18.â The steamship
j Olympia brings news that the Empress
! has issued a decree recognizing the
' Roman' Catholic religion throughout
I China and according an official grade to
all Catholic missionaries, who thus
; rank as mandarins. The French pro
tectorate of Catholics in China Is also
recognized with all its privileges. This
recognition was secured as a result of
strong French demands made following
I the murder of French missionaries in
! Interior provinces. It is hoped that the
| edict will give missionaries greater pro
i tection than they have had heretofore. j
I Anti-Christian riots in Fokien province
have caused all the missionaries to flee
to Foochow. .Seven Chinese Christians
were murdered during the riots.
It was reported that Rev. Mr. Phil
lips, his wife and other English mis
sionaries were murdered, but latest dis
patches announce their arrival at Foo
chow. Much missionary property was
destroyed. The British gunboat -.Iger
ine has arrived at Foochow.
A terrible explosion occurred last
month at the'Hokoku coal mine, Japan,
in which 220 persons were killed. Over
170 bodies have been recovered. A
naked lamp carried into the mine
caused the explosion.
The plague still rages in Formosa.
Up to June 25 there had been 1776
deaths since January 1 in Northern
Formosa.
The Nanking native correspondent of
the Shanghai Daily News reports that
Viceroy Liv, at Nanking, has received
a sensational secret edict from the Em
press Dowager directing him to use
armed forces to prevent the landing of
European troops in the Yang-tse-
Kiang Valley. The edict reads: "In
the event of the landing of armed
forces of European powers within the
jurisdiction of the imperial commis
t slonershlp of Nanyang you are hereby
I granted the liberty to employ armed
| resistance thereto. There will be no
' necessity of waiting for further in
structions from the throne. You will
be held responsible should there be any
failure in obeying these instructions
and It shall be in your dutyto notify our
commands to the various viceroys,
governors and provincial commanders
in-chief of maritime and river prov
inces comprised in your jurisdiction and
to see to it that effective opposition be
given to the foreign aggressors. Lib
erty is also given to you to keep back
taxes destined for the imperial ex
chequer in the event of lack of funds
to prosecute the war. Obey this in *-ar
and trembling."
Viceroy Liu's jurisdiction extends
over all the Yang-tse and maritime
provinces as regards foreign affairs and
military and naval matters. The Japa
nese home minister will shortly issue a
departmental notification relating to
the control of foreign religions. The
propagation of Christianity has here
tofore not been interfered with, and no
â  ' objection has been made to the erec
tion of churches, but the forthcoming ;
j notification will contain a clause re
' quiring that in the future before a
' church is erected the consent of the

TAPPED A CASH
REGISTER AS A JOKE
Excuse Made by a Suisun Man When
v Caught in the Act by a
Hotel Clerk.
SUISUtNT, July 18.â H. Bryan, pro
prietor of the Arlington Hotel, swore to
a complaint to-day charring Vincent
Bailey, formerly one of the proprietors
of the Louvre restaurant in this place,
with burglary. Mr. Bryan claims that
Bailey took money from his cash register
and has as a witness Leonard Downer,
night clerk in the Arlington Hotel. The
theft was committed at 4 o'clock this
morning. Bailey admitted having taken
some money from the register, but claims
it was done as a joke on Mr. Downer,
who is quite young and a new man in the
place.
Mr. Downer could not see where the
joke came in. He said that the defendant
and James Gray came into the place
shortly after 2 o'clock and for nearly two
hours stood up against the bar drinking.
Finally Gray was seized with a thirst for
Champagne, and there being none in sight
went to the liquor-room with Downer to
get a bottle. He held a lighted candle
while the clerk got the wine, and just as
Downer was about to shut the door he
heard the ring of the bell of the register.
He ran to the barroom, which he reached
in time to see Bailey coming from behind
the bar. Going to the drawer, he found
that money had been taken and imme
diately accused Bailey of taking It. Real
izing that denial was futile, Bailey dis
gorged, at the same time saying it was
only a josh.
When Mr. Bryan arose this morning
the matter was laid before him, with the
result that he swore out the warrant.
Bailey was taken before Justice Hitch
cock "this evening and held to appear be
fore the Superior Court, with bonds fixed
at $500.
ORTMAN IS SUSTAINED.
Gas Company's Franchise Is Assess
able in Stockton.
STOCKTON, July IS. â The County
Board of Equalization sustained Assessor
Ortman's assessment of the franchise of
the Stockton Gas and Electric Company,
the valuation being 1 $98,788. The company
protested against the assessment on the
ground that it's local property had already
been valued at 41000 in the general assess
ment of the company's property at the
head offlces in San Francisco.
District Attorney Ashley, gave an opin
ion at the request of the board holding
that the franchise was assessable where
the company was actually doing business,
and the board upon the reading of the
same denied the petition for the striking
out of the assessment. With this action
of the board all hopes by other corpora
tions of beating Ortman's assessments
end, as the members of the county
board are men who will not recede from
a position once taken. The protests of the
national banks will be disposed of short
ly and it is believed that in every in
stance Ortman will be sustained. If any
cutting is done the responsibility must
rest with the State Board of Equalization.
ANTI-DEBRIS ASSOCIATION
Will Press Suits Against Various
Mining Companies.
SACRAMENTO, July 18.â executive
committee of the Anti-Debris Association
held a meeting- to-day in the Supervisors'
room with Supervisor Jenkins in the
chair. R. T. Devlin, attorney for the as
sociation, reported the status of the suits
brought by the county of Yuba against
the Kate Hayes Mining Company, the
county of Sutter against John Spaulding
and others, and the county of Yuba
against Patrick Calabel and others. Prep
i arations for the prosecution of these
cases were discussed and It was decided
to push them to final issue.
The condition of the hydraulic mines in
the American, Bear, Yuba and Feather
rivers was also discussed. Some mines
have closed down on account of the water
supply and others are still running. The
association announced its intention to
make a thorough investigation of all min
ing territory, for the purpose of closing
down all mines .working injuriously be
fore the close of the next mining season.
PEOPLE FLEE FROM
HUNGRY MOSQUITOES
Insects Cause Inhabitants of a Snake
River Town to Seek Safety in
the Mountains.
BOISE, Idaho, July 18.â According to a
story from American Falls, a Snake River
town, the people there are being driven
from their homes by mosquitoes. Swarms
of the pestiferous insects, rivaling in size
and persistency the product of New Jer
sey, make life there unbearable. People
are leaving for the mountains as fast as
possible in order to escape absolute tor
ture. Sunday an attempt was . made to
hold divine services, but the mosquitoes
broke up the meeting, the preacher and
congregation fleeing from the building
covered with white spots.
It is reported that a babe left alone for
a short time was almost devoured by the
mosquitoes, being so badly poisoned that
it may not live. Drugs have been tried in
vain, and the people have determined to
take to the mountains until the pests
leave. ____________________________________
OIL DEVELOPMENT
A Pipe Line to Be Con
structed to the San
Joaquin.
Colonel A. F. Haraszthy, â¢ who has
been frequently seen in Fresno during
the past few months, arrived in town
again last night. He comes in consulta
tion with Judge Crichton, County Sur
veyor Hoxie, Dr. Maupin, A. C. Vandi
veer, N. P. Justy and others regard
ing the development of oil land. Colonel
Haraszthy was attracted to Fresno
County about four months ago by the
news of the oil strikes in the Panoche
belt. After satisfying himself that the
reports could be verified he engaged the
services of two experts and for the past
three months and a half they have been
pospecting this district. Colonel Har
aszthy immediately started out by
bonding every piece of property that
could be found by slightest indication
to be oil bearing. After some 7000 acres
had been located the colonel and his
associates made a more thorough ex
amination of the various properties
and decided that 2160 acres of the 7000
located were positively oil bearing. The
colonel, together with the above men
tioned gentlemen and a few* others, in
corporated the Union Consolidated Oil
and Transportation Company, with a
capital stock of $1,000,000, with head
quarters in San Francisco.
It is the intention of the company to
begin boring immediately on three dif
ferent pieces of the property. A central
storage tank will be erected and a pipe
line six inches in diameter constructed
from that point to the head of naviga
tion on the San Joaquin River, about
opposite Dos Palos. At the end of the
pipe line large tanks will be erected, a
switch will be run from the Southern
Pacific Railroad to the tanks, and
wharves constructed along the river
bank. The company will thus be en
abled to have either water or rail trans
portation, as the circumstances may re
quire. River boats of light draught
with iron oil tanks will be constructed
and their product hauled by water to
Stockton, Sacramento, Oakland, San
Francisco and San Jose, at which places
their oil wagons will be filled and the
consumer supplied. â Fresno Repub

WOODLAND SEWER BONDS.
WOODLAND, July IS.â Eight years ago
Woodland was bonded for the purpose of
constructing a sewer system, water works
and a municipal public building. These
bonds mature in 1911. The City Trustees,
by virtue of a law enacted by the last
Legislature, have made an application for
an extension of time, which will make the
last of the bonds mature in 1951. and the
outlook is fa able that the application
will be granted.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
WALLACE. Idaho, July IS.â The attor
j neys for the prosecution announced to
. day at noon that they had finished the
evidence against Corcoran. The- morning
i was devoted to proving the death of
Cheyne, which was testified to by Coroner
| France, who visited the wounded man at
Wardner and went with him to Spokane,
, where an operation was performed and
1 where he afterward died. The bullet had
I penetrated the' abdominal cavity and the
J murdered man had not one chance in
twenty for life after being shot.
"When court convened this afternoon At-
I torney Reddy asked leave to recall one of
I the State's witnesses for further cross
! examination. Permission was granted
| and the defense called Dr. Collins, who
! testified in the early part of the trial that
I he had been compelled to go to Wardner
: by masked men at the point of a rifle,
I who told him his professional services
might be needed.
The prosecution objected when witness
! was asked if he had talkeu with any per-
I son since giving his testimony in regard
i to identifying the defendant.
"What is the purpose of this?" asked
J the court.
"To show an, attempt at bribery.' re
| sponded Mr. Reddy.
The objection was overruled, and wit
j ness testified that the day after being on
I the witness stand he had received a tele
i phone message at his home in Burke in
forming him that Mr. Borah, one of the
State's attorneys, wanted to see him.
Witness came to Wallace and met Mr.
: Borah near the jail.
"Relate the conversation that occurred
; at that time." said Mr. Reddy.
"I was told that if I could or would
! identify- Paul Corcoran as being on that
train they had something better to offer
me than remaining in Burke."
Witness further said that no specific
â  sum was named and that he had declined
any offer or assistance predicated upon
' his identification of defendant and had
* not seen defendant on that day. On ex
; amination by Mr. Borah he .admitted that
he had testified falsely before the Coro
. ner's inquest when he denied having been
' on the train, but said that he had done
so to save his life, as he feared to return
to Burke should he identify any one. Mr.
Borah then took the stand and denied
having made such a proposition to wit
ness.
The defense called P. W. Foy. a resident
of Wardner, who was present when
Cheyne was shot. He contradicted Mrs.
: Sinclair, who said she was assisted in
! carrying Cheyne to a place of safety by
j a man wearing a white mask, whom she
recognized as defendant. Foy swore the
' man who assisted her wore a black mask
I and that it was closely drawn over vis
â  features and held in place by being fas
tened to both his hat and his coat. Three
i ladies living in Burke testified to having
: seen the defendant in Burke between the
I hours of 12 and I o'clock ar.d Matt Bautn
i partner, assayer for the Tiger-Poorman
I Mining Company, saw him about 3 o'cloc*
tin the afternoon. Corcoran could not
i have been at Burke and have gone to
! Wardner at the same time. The defense
I will probably not occupy more than two
i days. , m

CORONER HILL READY
TO EXHUME THE BODY
Says He Will Hold an Autopsy on
Mrs, Looria if Relatives so Desire.
Lays the Matter Before Chief of Police Lees and
Delivers Himself of an Opinion on the
Action of Dr. McMurdo.
CORONER HILL stands ready to
exhume the body of Mrs. Fannie
Looria should any relative of the
dead woman make the demand
that he investigate the ugly ru
mors persistently circulated since her
sudden taking off. . '
The Coroner's first information of the
demise of Mrs. Looria and of the strange
action of Dr. John R. McMurdo in Issu
ing a certificate of the cause of death,
without having so much as seen the body,
was obtained hen he picked up yester
day's Call and read the story of the death
and interment, He at once went to the
records, where he found that no report
of the case had ever been forwarded to
his office. The narrative of the circum
stances attending the decease of Mrs.
Looria made it plain to Dr. Hill that, foul
play or no foul play, the matter was one
for investigation by himself. The fact,
too, that Dr. Margaret Mahoney, acting
as the law prescribes a physician should
act in such case, had written a note
which she instructed should be taken to
the Coroner, strengthened this belief.
Coroner Hill called at once upon Chief
of Police Lees and laid the case before
him. The two agreed that the action of
Dr. McMurdo In th... issuance of the death
certificate had been entirely unauthorized,
and if generally practiced would make
the way easy for crime and almost im
possible" for its detection. The fact, how
ever, that the body was in a cemetery
in San Mateo County and that consider
able expense would have to be incurred
to exhume it, determined the Chief an.l
the Coroner in the conclusion that no
steps should be taken toward disinter
ment, unless some relative should make
the demand.
Coroner Hill, not satisfied with stopping
at this point, determined to call Dr. Mc-
Murdo to task for the part he had taken
in facilitating the burial of Mrs. Looria.
The Coroner decided to write a letter to
the ex-assistant city physician concern
ing the case, inquiring particularly why
Dr. McMurdo had stopped the note to Dr.
Hill written by Dr. Mahoney. The Coro
ner was busy writlfig the letter when seen
by a reporter for The Call.
'-â¢1 can't understand." he said, "why Dr.
McMurdo should have stopped Dr. Ma
honey's letter before it got to me. He
had no more moral right to do It than
i wouid have to intercept a letter in tnÂ«
United States mails addressed to you. No
more did he have authority to issue the
certificate -of the death ..T Mrs. Looria.
He had not attended the dying woman
and. as I am informed and believe, saw
her neither before nor after death. Un
der the law only he physician in attend
ance, or. failing him, the Coroner, is em- I
powered to sign a death certificate.
"Dr. Mahoney refused, ami properly, \
too, to sign the certificate. She did the
next best thing, however, and wrote a
note to mc. I never got it. It went to
Dr. McMurdo, and so did a fee. Had he i
sent the note to me, as he should have |
done, it is probable he would have lost the I
fee. That may explain why L did not get |
the note.
"This is not the first time the hand of
L>r. McMurdo has meddled with the busi
ness of the Coroner's office. I ha.i occa
sion last March to point this out to his
superior, then City Physician A. P.
O'Brien. At that time 1 wrote: 'It be
comes my duty to notify you that one of
your subordinates. Dr. Murdo, has been :
"for some time signing death certificates in
direct violation of the law you quote. I
must, therefore, ask you to issue an or- |
der forbidding him to do so in future.
* * * X am very sorry td deprive Dr. Mc-
Murd of the fees he was wont to receive
for doing this work, but you will agree
with me that the law Is paramount.'
"Dr. McMurdo does not seem to have ;
been disturbed by this letterâ in the Looria
case at any rate â and. although he is no
longer assistant city physician and can- i
not issue such certificates. I propose to ;
let him know that his action, altogether
without warrant of law. may have left
open the way to crime without a chance {
of detection. If any or all of his succes
sors have the power to issue certificates,

I as he has done, there might as well be no
i Coroner's offlce.
"In case 1 am asked to exhume the
body of Mrs. Looria 1 will do it. The un
dertaker informs me that it was not em
â¢ balmed, so that at any time an autopsy
may be held: proofs of poison. If any
Was taken into the woman's system, can
. be found."
It is not likely that any demand will be
made for an autopsy. The only surviving
relatives of the dead woman who made
any objection to the hasty burial of .Mrs.
Looria are the members of the Samuels
family, at 1103 Howard street. As pub
lished in yesterday's Call, Mr. and Mrs.
Samuels both made objection to the in
terment of the aged woman until the
Monday following her demise. They gave
as a reason that the death had been so
â  sudden, although they both have said
since that other and graver suspicions had
been aroused.
These suspicions are not shared by
Abraham Leszynsky. sexton of the syna
gogue at Post and Taylor streets, who
: had charge of the interment.
"The h^sty burial .of Mrs. Looria." he
said yesterday, "was made on my advice.
' She died on a Saturday morning and it
was the intention to bury her on Monday.
Her relatives are orthodox Jews, who will
not allow their dead to be injected with
embalming fluid. The car lines running
to the cemeteries will not take a corps*
two days after death unless the body has
been injected, therefore I suggested that
burial take place one day earlier than in
tended and she was buried on Sunday.
Everything was done in strict compliance
with the law. and I certainly would not
| have countenanced anything unlawful in
the case. The Jewish religion forbids any
post-mortem, and the haste is excusable
on that point."
The Samuels still contend that it had been
the oft-repeated intention of Mrs. Looria
to make some provision In her will for
their son. their impression being that. he
would receive half of the hard-earned
hoard lying at interest in the Hibernia
Bank. The death of Mrs. Looria Intestate
precluding the possibility of the heirship
of young Samuels, it is hardly possible
! that they will take any steps to probe
' into the manner of the death of Mrs.
Looria, particularly when such action
i would do them no good.
With the Samuels practically out of
consideration, the courts will ha\\> to busy
themselves with the question of the dis
tribution of the dead woman's money. On
the face this apears an easy task, but it
may not be. Looria. the surviving hus
band, claims one-half of the money on the
theory that it was community property.
His stepdaughter as strongly maintains
that it was not community- property; that
her mother had more than that when she
married Looria, and that it belongs en
tirely to her and not a cent to the wid
ower.
At present the daughter appears to be
living amicably with the stepfather, and
she says she will continue with him, not
withstanding the proffers of shelter from
benevolent Hebrew women, who have
taken pity on the girl's condition. She is
sickly and undoubtedly not strong in the I
head", still she insists that she alone is en
titled to her mother's money. Looria. ac
cording to the girl's story, told without
any feeling of bitterness toward the step
father, is equally bent on getting half of
it.
"Two weeks after my mother's death."
said the girl. "Looria asked me to go to
a lawyer's with him and sign over half
the money. He said it was his as well as
mv mother'sâ that he had helped to earn
it.' I told him it wasn't.''
"She came over to my house after her
father had asked her to sign for the
money.'' said Mrs. A. Davis of 186 Ship
ley street, "and told me about it. I said
to her. 'Mary, don't you be in a hurry to
sign your name. Wait till the court set
tles everything; then, if you want to, you
can give him half.' "
"Then I went back to my stepfather."
said the girl, "and told him. I wouldn't
sign." .

VALLEY ROAD PROGRESS.
The Stockton Section to Be in Opera
tion Next January Officers
Elected.
The San Francisco and San Joaquin
Valley Railroad held its annual meeting
yesterday for the purpose of electing its
officers and directors for the ensuing year.
E. P. Ripley, president of the Santa Fe,
was elected to fill the same position in
I the Valley Road Company, <'lavs Spreck
! els retiring from all active and official re
! lation with tne undertaking, of which he
| was the moving power. Tite retirement
docs not mean that Mr. Spreckels has
â  severed all connection with the road. He
i still holds a large bonded interest, his re-
I tirement from the presidency merely
'â  being made for the purpose of obtaining
more time to devote to his other airs.
This was the only change made among the
official heads of the road, Captain A. H.
Payson being re-elected to the position
of "vice president and Alexander Mackie
as secretary.
The board of directors now consists of
the following gentlemen: E, P. Ripley, A.
11. Payson. J. D. Spreckels, W. G. Nevin,
, A. F. Walker. E. N. Gibbs, Victor Maro
; witz. R. S. Hays, S. W. Van Bicklen and
H. C. Bush.
Chief Engineer W. B. Storey presented
his report, dealing with the technicalities
; of the road and the progress made during
i the last year, all of which has been pub
| lished in The Call. The report shows that
i aside from a little more minor work to be
, done on the different tunnels all that re
! mains is the construction of the track on
the seventy-mile from Stockton to Point
; Richmond. This will give the road, its
entire completion to the point where it
connects with the ferry service to this
city. . ,
The new boat beiitg built for that serv
ice will not be completed until some time
i next year; but the mad will doubtless be
! in operation in Its entirety by January I.
and the Ocean Wave, which was brought
down from the north for that purpose,
; will be carrying Into San Francisco pas
sengers from the second transcontinental
; line to the metropolis of the Pacific.
With the approval of President Ripley,
a circular was issued making the agents
: at Oakland, Sacramento, San Jose, Stock
i ton, San Francisco and Fresno joint
I agents of the Santa Fe.

MISSION BUTCHER ENJOYS
TAMING FEROCIOUS LIONS
LUDWIG SEELIGER AND HIS UGLY PET.
>-? LUDWIG SEELIGER, proprie
tor of a meat market at 330S
Mission street, ls called the
jl Tamer of the Mission,"
and the title is most worthily
bestowed, for Mr. Seeliger is as much
at home in a cage with a ferocious
cat as when trimming a roast for a
customer. In the rear of his place of
business Mr. Seeliger maintains a
small menagerie, the star of which is
a ten-months-old pure-bred African
lioness, weighing over 200 pounds and
apparently possessed of the temper of
a demon. Mr. Seeliger says in regard
to her vicious looks and treacherous
manner. that "it is only her way", when
in action; but "her way' makes the
flesh of the ordinary spectator creep
with apprehension, while his eyes un
consciously wander toward the back
door of the market, the only conceiv
able avenue of escape from the im
provised den. The "lion tamer" gave
a private exhibition of his power over
the beast yesterday for the benefit of
a reporter and an artist from The Call
and Ben Davis, the ex-Market In
spector.
The lioness occupies a large iron
cage at one side of the yard, and the
moment her visitors appeared she gave
ample evidence that she is not of the
dopy, sleepy kind so often seen at
public "zoos." She opened her huge
mouth and crouched as though about
to leap through the iron; bars, while
she snarled and growled in a threat
ening manner. The three visitors
showed signs of nervousness, but Mr.

Mission Detectives at
Work on the Case.
â â¦ â
LITTLE GIRL'S HEROIC ACT
â â¦ â
THEORY THAT THE MAFIA SO
CIETY IS IMPLICATED.
*.
Robbery Was Undoubtedly the Mo
tive That Prompted the Men
to Take Desperate
Chances.
The shooting affray in the grocery store j
of Jo*-. Lercari on San Bruno road, near
Fifteenth avenue south, late Monday
night is still concealed in a fog of mys
tery. The theory of th*- police points to
a personal feud with perhaps a financial
dispute at the back of it.
Lercarl formerly owned the vegetable
gardens on Guerrero, between Fifteenth
and Sixteenth streets, and some time
since sold it to Ravegno and Magini. Ler
cari claims that there is due him on the
deal $320 80, but Magini asserts that he
only owes $40. Detectives. Gibson and
Wren have been working on the case and
have gathered some facts from the. Ital
ians in the neighborhood and the general
opinion is that Magini owes the larger
sum. /.. .-.;;':.;*.'
On Monday night Ravegno, who now
lies on a couch in the city and County
Hospital with flesh wounds of no serious
character, telephoned to Dercari'a wife at
the grocery store that he would out
to the place at 8 o'clock, and that they
had better look out for Magini, ,as . he
meant trouble.. Ravegno went out to the
place and was talking with the six other
hangers-on, when the masked men en
tered and began the fusillade. -'..-'-
It is the belief that Magini and Lercari
have been playing . in one another's
hands In regard to the business deal, and
that a hot feud was brewing among all
concerned. When the attempted murder '
took place Lercari was the only cool and
self-possessed man in the place. The two !
masked men who carried the guns walked
away leisurely after the shooting, one sit
ting on the steps of the store and the
other on the fence opposite.
Robbery could hardly have been the mo
tive of the shooting, as there were eight
men in the store at the time when' the
shots were fired. The "Mafia" broke
loose, is what the police think, with a hint
or two of a woman at the bottom of it.
As yet no arrests have been made.
At the time the two bold highwaymen
Invaded the store, and after the despera
does had made known the object of their
visit by ordering all hands up and dis
charging their pistols at the men in the
store, there was one little heroine. Dora
Careghlno, among the crowd who did not
fall on her face, but, on the contrary,
stood her ground and called for the po
lice. This little heroine Is the sister-in
law of Lercari and is only 10 years of age.
She is as pretty and Interesting as she is
brave. She gave a clear account of all
that transpired from the time the robbers
entered until she and her married sister.
Mrs. Lercarl, went out by the side door,
where they .obtained a full view of one
of the men. while he sat on the fence op
posite the house. -. -7
While sitting on the fence the electric
light shone full on the man's face, thus
giving the two ladles opportunity to give a
thorough description of the man to De
tectives Graham and Fitzgerald. The fel

Seeliger assured them there was no
danger, and stepping up to the door of
the cage, prepared to undo the fasten
ings. His hand had scarcely touched
the chain than the lioness, with a
blood-curdling growl, threw herself
against the door. The artist bolted
for the only exit, the reporter tried to
climb a ten-foot fence and Davis made
a break for the shed in the rear of
the yard, only to fall- over a big Rus
sian bear which was enjoying a sun
bath. Seeliger finally succeeded In
rounding up his guests and entered the
cage armed with a small whip and a
chair. lie made the beast jump over
both the chair and himself and go
.through various other evolutions, but
she never ceased to snarl and snap
during the performance and several
times made vicious digs at her tor
mentor with her sharp claws. When
Seeliger prepared to leave the cage
her fury redoubled, and as he jumped
through the door. she sprang at him
as though determined to have revenge
for her humiliation; but the door
swung between them and she was
robbed of her prey. Mr. Seeliger again
entered the cage, this time accom
panied by a great mastiff. The
lioness paid no attention to the dog.
but she seemed uglier than ever, and
it was with relief that the visitors
once more, saw the door safely locked
with the trainer on the outside.

Mr. Seeliger, and while the lioness'

SHIPWRECKED PILOTS

Steamer Newsboy Was Run on a Rock

j Captains Bolles and Bulger, United

rendered a decision yesterday suspending
for four months the licenses of Captain
C. Ellefsen. master, and H. Hanson, chief I
mate, of- the coasting steamer Newsboy.
The Newsboy started from San â '. Fran- I
cisco for a northern port, and was run
upon a rock and damaged to the extent of
1600.
After announcing the written opinion I
Captain Bulger remarked that if masters
of coasting vesels desired to run their
steamers over the country roads In com
petition with automobiles' they should
take out a license for navigating the' land. I
Supervising inspector Bermingham . re
marked that if the careless mariners !
would take half as much pains to .keep |
their vessels from running upon the rocks
as they did to explain how they got there, !
there would be no shipwrecks of coastwise i
vessels. . â¢â  â  .-'â  â â¢ "â¢-.â

Edwin Stevens of the Tivoli Will
Soon Transfer His Affections

Edwin Stevens of the Tivoli will join
the Henry Miller Company at the close
of his present engagement. The matter
was quietly arranged between Miller and
Stevens on Monday, and the latter will
leave the Tivoli on the last of this month.
When Miller presents "Hamlet" at the
Columbia Stevens is to play the part of
the King. He is thoroughly familiar with
the part, having played every part in
"Hamlet."
amiability was not appreciated by
those whom he addressed, his assertion
was not disputed. Mr. Seeliger then
put the bear through a few tricks, but
the hairy-coated animal was playful
and harmless compared with his ill
looking neighbor.
Mr. Seeliger is a native of Dresden,
Germany, 39 years old. His parents
died when he was young and he learned
the trade of a butcher. He traveled
with Rentz's Circus, as celebrated in
Europe as is Barnum's In this country,
for two years, and it was during this
time that he acquired a love for fon
dling wild beasts. Twenty years ago
he came to this country and eleven
years ago settled in the Mission, near
Irs present location.
The lioness is a half-sister of Wal
lace, the big African lion at the
Chutes, and was purchased in Omaha
three months ago. Mr. Seeliger has
arranged to exhibit her at the Chutes,
probably next Sunday, but his primary
object in securing her is to go into the
business of raising lions. The bear
was brought from Siberia by a sea
captain friend of his. Mr. Seeliger
raises a bear or two every year for
the market, killing them about Christ
mas time, when there is a big demand
for bear meat. He says he intends to
put the bear in the cage with the
lioness soon and teach them to act
together. Mr. Seeliger is a good-look
ing, good-natured gentleman, as un
like the typical animal trainer as it is
possible to imagine; but there is no
questioning the Quality of his nerve.
DODGE MAKES
MORE CHANGES
IN HIS OFFICE
Five New Deputies
Are Appointed.
VICTIMS FOR THE BASKET
â * â
FAT BILL ALMON AND CHARLIE
FAY GIVEN BERTHS.
â¦ââ
When the Doctor Returns From His
Vacation It Is Expected That
Many Heads Will
Fall.
*
Conditions in Assessor Dodge's office are
sadly disturbed and the fortunate poli
ticians who have been holding down snug
berths in the offlce have been on the
anxious seat for the past week. Several
important changes in the running force
of the Assessor's office t were made yester
day and those who profess to know the
inside of the Assizor's political affairs
are authority for the statement that many
surprising changes will be made as soon
as Dr. Dodge returns from the country,
whither he went yesterday for a two
weeks' hunting trip.
Several heads are slated for the basket,
but just who the unfortunate will be is
not known. Five new deputies were ap
pointed yesterday by Dr. Dodge before he
left the offlce, and, judging from the
political connections of the new ap
pointees who will feed at the public crib
until the end of the next campaign, it
might be said that Dr. Dodge is attempt
ing to pour oil on the troubled waters of
Democracy and recognize certain elements
â¢of the party that have thus far been
slighted in the distribution of patronage.
John Fitzgerald, who was Sheriff
Whelan's right bower during his incum
bency, has. been employed in Assessor
Dodge's office since Dodge assumed his
official duties, but "Jack," as he is fa
miliarly called in political circles, is now
out of a job, and Phil Fay, a brother of
Charlie Kay. Mayor Phelan's close-up ad
visor, took Fitzgerald's place on the pay
roil. "Bill" Almon, whose political im
portance is due to his strange resemblance
to Sam Rainey and the fact that he is
the lauded leader of affairs political in
the Thirty-fourth District, was given a
snug berth in the offlce. George Van
divier. Charlie Pratt and Al Murphy, well
known pollies, were also appointed.
As soon as Dr. Dodge returns it is ex
pected that more appointments will be
made and the official heads of a corre
sponding number of clerks and deputies
will be decapitated.
WILL PBESENT THE MEDALS.
Mechanics' Institute Will Give Up
the Pavilion to the Native
Sons and Daughters.
At an Informal meeting of the board of
directors of the Mechanics' Institute,
which was held last night, it was decided
that the Mechanics' Institute shall be
turned over to the Native Sons and
Daughters whenever they shall desire for
the presentation of the medals which are
to be given to the First California Regi
ment. Douglass Young, the editor of
Freedom, published at Manila, also ap
peared at the meeting and stated to me
members that he personally knew that the
Filipinos were in favor of making friends
with the people of the United States and
that he thought that a great good could
be accomplished by the fair if the Fili
pino exhibit were given a good show.

MRS. LOUISA KOPP
HELD FOR MANSLAUGHTER
JUDGE CONLAN DECIDES THERE |
WAS NO PREMEDITATION.
The Woman Is in the Last Stages of
Consumption and Had Almost
to Be Carried to and
From Court.
Mrs. Louisa Kopp was yesterday held
to answer before the Superior Court by
Judge Conlan on the charge of man
slaughter for shooting and killing her
husband. Charles Kopp, on June 28 last.
Her bonds were fixed in $1000. .
The Judge in rendering his decision said ;
that both sides agreed upon the facts as
to the shooting, but the question arose
as to whether it was a case of justifiable j
homicide. While morally there was a
great deal of merit in the part enacted
by the defendant, still it had been shown
that her husband came to his death at
her hands throne^, violence and through
the medium of a deadly weapon. The
Judge said that while sympathy was with
the defendant, he would not assume the
responsibility of discharging her. He
could not give way to his feelings, but
had to deal with the facts.
"While I must conclude, continued the 1
Judge "that a crime has been committed,
I do not believe that it is a case of homi- I
cide- and altnough legally there was no
justification for it. there was no premed
itation and it could be nothing more than
manslaughter. I have even grave doubts
as to its being that. If I were a juror
on the case. I could readily realize what
my verdict would be; but as a commit
ting magistrate, I shall hold the defend
ant to answer on the charge of man
slaughter and will fix her hail at the
lowest sum ever set in the courts on such
a charge, viz.. $1000. *'
The defendant had almost to be car
ried to and from the court by Bailiff
Kelly and Officer Bella as she is in the .
last stages of consumption. Her attor
ney. ex-Judge Ferral. will have her out
on* bonds to-day. 'â
