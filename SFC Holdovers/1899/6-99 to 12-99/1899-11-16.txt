VOLUME L.XXXVI-NO. 169.
BRITISH TROOPS AND BOERS
ARE FIGHTING AT CLOSE RANGE
Investing Forces at Ladysmith Approach Within
Fifteen Hundred Yards of the Defensive Lines.
English War Office Yet Refuses to Give
Out the News.
SBAN, Sunday, Nov. 12.â 1t is rumored here that Commandant General Joubert of
the Boer forces is dead.
1 he Times of Natal publishes a telegram from Lourenzo Marquez saying that Gen
eral Joubert was killed in action on Thursday, November 9.
British Troops on the March to the Relief of Mafeking.
LONDON', Nor. -16.â The
impenetrable veil of silence
as to the movements of the
British troops in Natal and Cape
Colony continues, but this must
not be taken to mean that there
is nothing important happening.
On the contrary the very reverse
may well be the case.
When war began news of the
fighting at Dundee was being
sold on the streets of London
while the battle was actually go
ing on, by cable time. Lack of
news from I smith is not now
owing to defective means of com
munication, but simply to the fact
that practically no information as
to military movements is allowed
to come through. General Duller
and Sir George White are once
more in direct communication
with each other.
The messages of last Friday
reporting a continuation of the
'ineffective bombardment are the
last news received from Lady
smith. Even the Boers do not
claim much for their bombard
ment. In a Pretoria dispatch it
is stated that the investing forces
are # at one point within 1500
yards of the defensive lines of
Ladysmith. This would require
very strong confirmation. Fif
teen hundred yards is the com
mencement of what is technically
known as "decisive ranges" of
fiel I artillery firing shrapnel
shells. It is quite apparent that
the Boers have a heap of respect
for those missiles.
Heliograph messages Friday
have reported that the British
position was not affected by the
bombardment. Still it seems evi
dent that the investment has be
come closer and the Boers bolder.
An important fact is mentioned
by the Daily Telegraph's war cor
respondent, which, if confirmed,
would seem to indicate the begin
ning of the end in Natal. He says
that the Free State burghers are
returning home. It has been sus-.
The San Francisco Call
â¢ 1 that the besieging army of
!'.<>er< must be feeling somewhat
tely the pressure of hunger.
Their commissary arrangement s
have been exposed to a heavy
strain, with only a single railway
connecting them with their base.
The Free Staters also have only
one railway to Harrismith and
are afraid thai < .cn-ral l'.uller
may l.c advancing on the ( Hraige
republic from the south.
News of the fighting from
Mafekinp shows that the Strug
s' W- there has been fierce. Colonel
Baden-Powell is reported as hold
ing lii - own np to the 6th. Kim
ntinued tnenect
imbardment All is well on
thr northern Cape frontier. There
i*- no material change, so far
as known. From the transports
which have arrived within the
past week more than 18.000 men
have been added to the strength
of the P.ritish force.
The total British casualties, so
far as at present known, amount
To 2362. The killed are reported
afl 267 and the missing 1202.
CANNONADING CEASED AND
RIFLE FIRE COMMENCED
CAPE TOWN. Nov. 10.â A dispatch re
ceived here from Pretoria under date of
Thursday, November 9. says the reports
received there i from Ladysmlth said
heavy cannonading started at daybreak,
and thnl some of the Boer forces were
within i.vw yards of the British, when
the cannonading ceased and rifle fire com
menced.
The Pretoria dispatch also announces
that all was quiet at.Mafcklng and Klm
berley.
An undated dispatch from Mafeklng. re
ceived by a runner via Magalapye, Wed
nesday, November 8, says:
â¢'To-day all is quiet. We have been
bombarded pretty heavily all week. Fri- j
day night Captain Fitz-Clarenoo and
Lieutenant Swinburne, with a squadron
of the Protectorate Regiment, made a
magnificent bayonet charge upon the
Boers' intrenchment, driving them from
tb'-ir positions and bayoneting numbers
of the Boers, who must have lost very
heavily. The charge was most gallant
and determined. The - party could not
hold the trenches and lost six men killed,
two prisoner* and nine wounded In their
regiment- We expect another attack to
morrow. The bombardment has been
most Ineffectual. Every one remains un
der shell-proof cover. So far the shells
have only wounded one man.
"The enemy is using one 94-pound How
itzer and seven other guns from' 7 to 14
pounders. The town is most cheerful and
determined. to resist attack to VÂ» utmost^
SAN FRANCISCO, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 16, 1899.
; The Boers are intrencfied on every s,lde
In great numbers and are pushing grad
ually closer and closer to the town forti
fications. Wo are well off for provisions
and water. though tired dodging shells
and lighting. Quite on civilized lines.
General Cronje has always given due no
tice :of â  bombardment and allowed an
ambulance party two hours on Saturday
to recover the bodies of six dead left in
the vicinity of the Boer trenches. On
Friday night Jan Botha, the well-known
Boer commandant, told a man with the
ambulance party that their loss had been
very heavy and that his heart was very
sore. The wounded Included Captain
FitS-Clarence and Lieutenant Swinburne
both slightly.
"In a skirmish at the outposts yester
day one trooper was killed and nine were
wounded. Only tlfty-flve men of I) squad
ron were engaged in the attack, though
they wero assisted by the Hanking fire of
a gun of the Cape police. The Boers
', made a desperate attempt to drive back
the British and their rear trenches opened
: 11 terrific fire in every direction, the flash
of the rifles lighting up the entire posi
tion. a hall of bullets rattled off the
roofs of the houses of the town. Upon
completing a circuit of the Boer front and
the line of trenches, the British with
drew in Independent lines of retreat, cov
ered by the flank tire from the Cape po
lice. The Boers continued to volley at
Intervals during the night. The Boer loss
is estimated at 100 killed and wounded.
The Boer commander Informed the officer
In charge of a flag of truce that ho esti
mates the attacking squadron at 1000 and
was not aware that the British force at
Marking was so large. The Boers were
observed from Mafeking burying their
dead all day long."

ThÂ«Â» fact that the. Britannic proceeded

GENERAL CRONJE'S
TACTICS AT MAKEKING
LONDON. Nov. 15â A dispatch to the
Dally Mall from Mafeking, sent by way
of Magalpie. because the runners sent
southward were unable to traverse the
Boer lines, gives an Interesting account
of the fighting during the last week In
October. The correspondent says:
"Alter the failure to ruah. the towiÂ±
General Croiij,. had recourse to the tactics
employed during the siege of ' Potchef
stroom in ISO, making an advance to the
town by a succession of trenches In eche
lon. Such a movement had been antici
pated l v us for some time and for that
reason there had been sent out parties to
worry the Boers incessantly by night at
tacks. These tactics the enemy disliked,
but he contented â¢ himself with a daily
shell lire, which exposed him to little per
sonal risk. Then Colonel Baden-Powell
played his trump card by sending out
Fltz-Clarence's party to worry the occu
pants of the trenches. The little force
stole out silently In the darkness. No
shot was fired and the men, with fixed
bayonets, creeping rather than walking
along, approached the chief Boer position
near the racecourse. Then as they closed
in there was a shrill screech. It was
Fitz-Clarence's whistle and the signal for
onslaught. A ringing cheer, which the
listeners back In camp caught up, was the
only reply as the party dashed into the
trenches. There was a short struggle, the
attacking forces catching and bayoneting
Boers under the tarpaulins where they
crouched. crying for mercy. At least fifty
bayonets ~M to work, and the havoc they
wrought was terrible.
'"For just a moment there was no sys
tematic return tire, but then a pi
hailstorm of bullets poured in from the
tr. n< hes to the rear. Again Fitz-ciar
ence's whistle sounded. It meant 'cease
firing and scatter homew; â¢â  rd .' The British
forces scattered, creeping back under the
furious nre In the darkness to the ap
pointed rendezvous, where the roll was
called.
"Colonel Baden-Powell met and congrat
ulated Captain Fitr-Olarence and his men
upon their splendid work, saying that it
was a heavy price to pay. but th.'it the
Boors had to be stopped making rifle
trenches within the range of the town.
The mÃmbtrs of the party are now the
envy and pride of the garrison.
"Even the Boer commander. Botha, ex
pressed admiration of the attack. ' and
added that he would take Mafeklng before
long, for he meant to do one thing or the
other quickly. Sunday parsed quietly, the
volunteer hand playing In the woman's
laager. All Sunda> night the Boers potted
a rifle fire into the town. It was set going
after Sunday evening, when Colonel H.i
den-Powell hoisted a red lamp on the
i- mmonaga, which was the signal for
c.iptaln Kitz-Clarence's night attack. The
ruse answered splendidly The moment
light appeared the Boers opened fire
.id their fusillade lasted the whole night
through.
"There haa been a tremendous was to
of ammunition. Indeed, it is estimated
that 3<Â».OOO rounds of ball cartridges ware
wasted on the occasion of the night at
tack on the Boer tranches. Double rations
have been served out to the men. who are
under shelter, so as to be on the safe side
If the Boers should sweep the town by a
long rifle fire. The garrison Is hanging
on finely. Colonel Baden-Powell has the
fullest confidence In everybody, and es
pecially in the matter of Implicit obedi
ence to the order to hold the nre until the
Boers get to close range.
"The shelling continued all Sunday at
intervals. About 4 o'clock In the after
noon General Cronje sent a flag of truce,
(riving Mafeking a last chance to surren
der at the eleventh hour. While the flag
was receiving attention the heavy bom
bardment continued."
The dispatch then describes Genera.
Cronje's great attack of Monday, the de
tails of which have already been ob
tained from Colonel Baden-Powell's offi
cial dispatch.
"The end came." says the correspond-

DISPATCHES published exclusively |
In an edition of The Call yesterday
convey* d to the public the first
â¢ news that Mrs. Stanford had sold i
her Southern Pacific stock for a sum ex
ceeding 111.000.000. The Intelligence pro
duced a profound and gratifying sensa
tion throughout the State. The news
comprised highly acceptable reading, as
every town In California manifests a keen
i interest in the growth and development
I of Stanford University.
Additional advices by wire from New
York corroborate The Call's story In all
I the essential particulars.
The number of shares of Southern Pa
cific stock sold by Mrs. Stanford was
283.000. The Huntlngton-Speyer syndicate
paid $40 par share.
Yesterday word was received by wlrÂ»Â»
that Mrs. Stanford had transferred $11.
1 000.000 to the endowment fund of the uni
versity. Mrs. Stanford still retains 20.000
shares of Southern Pacific stock, wnich
She can readily sell for $SOO.OOO. but the
shares may be so joined with others trat
she cannot now place the remaining block
on the market.
From inside sources The Onll ascertains
that Mrs. Stanford sold a portion of her
20.000 shar- of Central Pacific stock for
$25 per share. When she sold the residue
the price paid by the purchaser was $37 J
per share. It Is ascertained from trust
worthy sources that the sum she derived
from Central Pacific holdings approxi
mated J. 520.000. From the sale of her Mar
ket-street Railway stock the sum of $1.
500.000 was derived. The Call Is Informed
that the proceeds of the Central Pacific
and Market-street loldtngs were also
conveyed to the university endowment
fund.
It is known that Mrs. Stanford still
retains a one-fourth interest in the
Pacific Improvement Company. News
that will surprise and gratify all
those interested in the university is
now coming to light. The Call ascer
tains that her one-fourth interest in
the Pacific Improvement Company is
worth at least $7,000,000 and may
produce an ultimate cash return of
$10,000,000.
The company was established r>y Le
land Stanford. Charles Crocker, C. P.
Huntlngton and Mark Hopkins as the
bank of the great railroad corporation.
Each one of the founders took 25 per cent
of the stock. The operations of the bank
were vast and varied. At one time,
when C P. Hunttngton was employing
r\t>ry resource of personal energy and
mental skill to meet the demands of the
Government and other creditors, the ob
ligations resting on the Pacific Improve
ment Company were tremendous. One
could hardly believe, even after Inspect
ing the records of financial transactions,
that a single company could borrow as
much money as the Pacific Improvement
Company was obligated to pay.
Readers are advised to bear in mind
that the Santa Fe. I'nion Pacific, North
ern Pacific and many other railroad cor
porations succumbed to the pressure and
consented to settlement by appointment
of receivers. At this time C. P. Hunting
ton, Mrs. Stanford and the sons of
Charles Crocker resolved to raise the
money to meet every obligation, redeem
every bond and pay to the t'ntted States
every dollar of principal and Interest.
even if the payment required a pledge of
their personal fortunes. When the de
mand for money was greatest C. P. Hun
tlngton mortgaged his New York man
sion. At that time he secured assurance
that the CnÂ«kers were ready to assist
with their real estate and personal prop
ertyâln fact, were ready to pledge their
private fortunes.
It is a matter of history that the Gov
ernment was paid In full. There was no

EXAMINER AGAIN CAUGHT
STEALING THE NEWS

West Oakland Saloonkeeper.

HE *fIE*AmS UNCONSC
THREE STAGES IN AN EXAMINER NEWS THEFT.
The three clippings represented above *re from the fourth
page of yesterday's Examiner. That on the left shows a corner of
the page as finished for the street sales and Oakland patrons. That
in the middle shows the same corner of the same page as re-made
for country circulation and generally for city subscribers. Both of
these pages were sent from the Examiner pressroom and circulated
before the news thieves obtained a copy of The Call and discovered
that this paper contained the exclusive news of Mrs. Jane Stan
ford's tremendous sale of Southern Pacific stock in New York. All
haste was then made to the Examiner office, the presses were
stopped and a new page prepared. The third clipping on the right
shows the theft of the Important item stolen from The Call.
THE Examiner la Improving Xl sens* of what constitutes the news. *vÂ»n
if it is not advancing above the low plane of Its morals. It la a matter
of public Interest to announce that the Examiner stole from The Call
the Important Item telling of Mrs. Jane Stanford'!* gigantic sale of
Southern Pacific stock to the Huntington-Speyer combination. This
theft Is worthy of comment simply because It demonstrate* that the
yellow sheet will publish legitimate news If such news can "n- stolen. It N m
acknowledgement of the fact that Â»he energy of honest newsgatherers and th*Â»
success of their efforts are recognized ivcn In the curiosity shc>r> nf t hÂ»Â» Kt
aminer.
When The Tall gave exclusive publication to the fact of the absorption of
the T'nlon Iron Works by a mammoth trust, the Examiner strove, with every
effort peculiar t<> Itself, to discredit the news. After floundering In Its own fail
ure It wan forced to admit the truth of wht. The Tall had published several
days before. Since then the yellow sheet has displayed a certain Improvement.
When It finds Itself outclassed In a service which It pretends to render the
public It will su i\ what It cannot honestly obtain.
With this policy The rail Is not particularly concerned. It has no protec
tion against such larcenies, anil It .s pleased to see even in fh" Kxnmlner some
legitimate news. It would be better pleased, as an agent wishing to see the.
regeneration even of thieves, to record a further reformation In the Exam
iner. The Tall would consider It sn act of common decency and emmrtmf If
the Examiner would give credit to The fall whenever a news Item of Import
ance Ik taken from this paper. The yellow sheet finds such a necessity nearly
every day. and an admission of the fact would be accepted as a pledge of oth
er honesty.
It is the business of The Pall to publish the news, and this latest triumph
Is another indication that the business, as conducted by The Crill. |* a Â«uic
cess. It Is a matter of Interest, therefore, to tell how the Examiner obtaVnel
the r.e vs of the great transaction in which Mrs. Stanford figures as a princi
pal. The Call had exclusive information from New York. The Examiner knew
n-ihlnt; of the affair. The Pall appeared on the streets yesterday morning
and was read by members of the Examiner staff.
When thesÂ». worthy orn.-fnents of the yellow sheet discovered that they
nad nothing of the Stanford sensation they rushed back to the Examiner
pressroom and stopped the presses while the stolen news was being filched
from The Call and prepared for the Examiner. The presses had not been
stopped soon enough, however, as the street and country editions, without the
stolen dispatch, had already escaped. The best of a bad situation was accept
ed, however, and the stolen news was sold to seme of the local subscribers
of the yellow sheet. After resorting to these desperate measures to MNM
another humiliating defeat the Examiner might have had at least the gra
clousness to give credit to The Call. It may perhaps admit now what The Call
Is in a position to proveâ that It did not receive from New York a line of the
dispatch which gave an outline of the Stanford sale.

THE PAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURPDAT, NOVEMBER 16, 1899.
McKINLEY HAS SENT A
MESSAGE TO AGUINALDO
If the Fugitive Insurgent Leader Can Be Over
hauled He Will Be Asked to Give Better
Treatment to Prisoners.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. WELL
INGTON HOTEL. WASHINGTON.
Nov. 15.â compliance with re
peated representations of the Span
ish Government in behalf of Its
subjects held prisoners by Fili
j pinos, the President has Bent a message
j to General Otis for transmission to Agul
' naldo. under which humane treatment
will doubtless be accorded to them. It Is
; understood that General Otis has for
warded the message to General Mac A
rthur with instructions to send It to Agul-
I naldo If he can be located. The message
speaks of the desire of the President that
prisoners shall receive kind and humane
; treatment.
It Is presumed here that Agulnaldo's ,
disinclination to surrender prisoner!
grows out of his desire to hold them and
! use them to gain more advantageous
| terms in case he should be surrounded
; n"y American troops. The fact that Gen
eral Otis sent the message to General
i Mac Arthur indicates that he believes
Agunlaldo Is within the cordon of Ameri
can troops established by Generals Law
ton and Wheaton.
General MucArthur Is advancing toward
Dagupan along the line of the railroad,
| driving Insurgent bands Into the arms of
thÂ£ American troops waiting for then at
points selected by Generals Wheaton and
Lawton. Whether Ajrulnaldo has pent the
prisoners to Hayombong Is not known,
but no matter where they are, an In
struction from him. it Is believed, will re
' sult in better treatment being accorded
to them. The Spanish Government has
been very much concerned Ã¼bout the pris
oners, and has submitted reports to Sec
retary Hay Indicating that many of them
I have suffered very bad treatment.

In the report of the Philippine Commis
sion.
Professor Worcester said at the outset
that the issues raised by the Philippine
Question, directly or indirectly, wr-rr more
Important, more far-reaehlnp in their
rnnfpqiionrcs than any other nation has
ailed upon to meet since its birth.
He deprecated the idea <<( those willing

ling, he said:
"If all the accusations brought by those
who declaim against our so-called 'crime
in the Philippines' are true we have, in
deed, committed a great transgression
against the people of those islands. I
propose to take up some of the alleged
facts often quoted in support of these i â
rious charges and scrutinize them some
what closely. I shall try to make my ex
amination wholly dispassionate."
Professor Worcester then took up vari
â xfuments presented against the
American policy in the Philippines, and,
quotinK from Senate documents, from the
proclamations of Aguinaido and from s
mass of official evlden--.-. ni"Â«t of which
has been made public, answered (!.â¢

The wave of prosperity which followed

Presideaf David Starr Jordan of Stan

Plraacteeo yesterday afternoon, en rt>ute
;to Sucrami'iito. Up had received BO
wc.r<] fr.mi Mrs Stanford concerning the
Smta of her Southern Pacific stock for
1 $11.4on.r>ort, but he did not for a moment
<l"-,]l.t the truth of The Call's story to thai
â effect. On the contrary. I>r. Jordan ad
mitted that he had an Idea such a deal
i-elng negotiated and expressed bit
ire at the news of Its consumma
tion.
"You folks know more about It than I
do." he said, with a smile, "for 1 have not
received a. word from Mrs. Stanford on
the subject since she left for theiJJast..
Of course we knew that Mrs. Stanford in
tended disposing of th" Southern Pacific
stock as soon as she could do so advan
tageously, as It was producing no income,
all the earnings of the road being put, into
Improvements. When Mrs. Stanford Rave
the stock to the university it wok with
the understanding that she should he al
lowfd to soil it should a favorable opt* r
tunity nrise, although as trustee iri the
university she had power to sell the ftock
even If that condition had not been at
tached to the rift." .
Dr. Jordan was asked what immediate
uses the money would be put to, but he
declined to talk on that subject. : ;',.%;
"That is a matter that must be deter
mined by Mrs. Stanford." he said, "and I
have no authority to speak for her The

As showing the bloody work of the in
surgents. Professor Worcester said: .
"At the time I left Manila the province
Of Bataabagaa was overrun with thieves
and murderers. No attempt was being
made to enforce law and order. The pub
lic schools were abandoned. Forced con
tributions were wrung from tho people at
the bayonet point, until many were
ruined. Unwilling contributor* had been
punished by having their hands hacked
off and even by being burled alive. The

trooj.s If we would only dispatch a small

'â¢Those who affect to believe that we

ence in the Philippines; that the natives
would continue to hate us If we gave
them good government, that they would
it* better off under a very bad government
of their own than a very good one .admin-
Istered in part by ours, and that the only
logical and honorable course open to us
Is to withdraw our forces and leave the
peaceable and law-abiding natives of the
Philippine Islands at the mercy of Aguin
aldo' and his army, may be sincere In
their convictions, but by freely giving
voice to them they are encouraging the
ambitious Tagalo lender to prolong a
hopeless struggle. The prolongation of
this struggle is costing us millions of dol
lars, and, what is far worse, good red
American blood. Lot history nx the re
sponsibility for it.
"Those of us who believe the flag should
stay In the East, and that under Its shad
ow we should patiently teach to our new
wards the lessons they must learn ere
they can take their place in the great
family of nations as a free and united
people, should stand shoulder to shoulder.
There Is work for us t.i do. Let those

that Urn acquisition of a large amount of

CHINESE KILLED
BY HIGHBINDERS
Feud of Tongs Leads to
an Assassination.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« CmU.
SAN JOSE, Nov. 15 Highbinder trou
bles broke out afresh In the Sixth street
Chinatown thH evening and resulted In
the assassination of Gin Suey, a cook.
Six men entered the general merchan
dise store of guong Chung Lung 4t Co.
ThÂ» y at once opened fire on Wong Ban.
tio.,kkÂ»-eper of the store, who seemed to
be their especial target. Revolvers lq*>d
p'l with bullets and buckshot were used.
bat Han escaped with only a slight scaJp
wound from one buckshot.
In the room were Wong Wah On. Wong
Chung. Gin Suey and Wong Sing. After
firing the first round of shots the high
binders backed out of the door and poured
a fusillade through the glass door sji.l
window. Gin Suey was shot in the left
side, in range of the heart, the bullet
passing through his body. He died in
stantly. The others escaped to the rear
of the store.
The arrival of officers found no trace of
the assassins. A mammoth horse-pistol
from which had been fired buckshot was
picked up at the scene of the shooting,
and the bullet marks showed that about
twenty shots had been llred.
The shooting was the result of a long
standing feud between th*Â» Hip Sing Tong
and the Wong family. Pirtng the p.xst
year no less than a dozen shooting scrapes
have taken place between these factions,
but this Is about the first fatality. Th*Â»
highbinders engaged In the shooting mad*
their escape from Chinatown on foot and
were seen making their way toward the
railroad leading to Mllpltas.

JOBBERS WEAK
IN ARGUMENT
Injured by Their Own Witnesses
in the Fight for Pacific Coast
Business.
BT. LOUIS, Nov. ]Â«.â The third day's proceedings In the hearing before the
Interstate Commerce. Commission accentuates our former statement that the
whole proposition Is a contest between different Jobbing an<: manufacturing
centers f<r a market. To the most casual observer the fact Is apparent that
the r.omin:Â«l defendants, the railroads, have very little Interest In the Â£ase .
as compared with that of the jobbers and manufacturers Jf the Pacific Coast
and Middle WÂ»-st. The carriers claimâ and It certainly stems fair to presume
âthat their present tariffs air the result of years of experience and are the
best which they know how to make, with due* consideration to their own in
terests and for tho interests of the sections they -â¢ r\ â¢ :â¢ "â "
The radical changes asked for by the Middle West, while possibly. If
granted, they might prove equally as profitable tÂ«r the railroads, could only
result In the demolishing of the business of thnr patrons on the coast and
tho consequent disturbance of . -'â â¢â¢ â - â  relations In that section.
Thus far the evidence submitted by the complainants has been along thÂ©
lines of trying to show the commission that the defendant railroads were not
Justified In giving Pacific Coast Jobbers an 4 manufacturers the present dif
ferentials lwÂ»twecn carload and leÂ«s than carload shipments, and to do : this
wnter comiKHltlon. which was originally and Still is the reason why h
differentials were and are Riven, has been belittled and made light of, the.
claim being made that it no longer exists to an extent sufficient to make. It
potential In ratemaklng. No difficulty will be experienced, as every coast
manufacturer and jobber knows, in refuting this, but the wisdom of the .
business men of the coast In askinc to be made parties to the suit and being. .
on hand to protect their Interests, which are far greater than those of the nul-
road?. befnrÂ»> the commission Is too patent to admit of doubt; ;- ; : â¢ â 
TtÂ» illustrate this briefly: \' the Jobbers of St. Louis and Chicago, set.,
forth in tbetr complaint that owing to the present "unfair and Iniquitous
tariff" they have been drawn from the territory west of the one hundred and.
fifteenth meridian, the railroads might have accepted this statement and let it
pass unchallenged. Our attorney compelled their star witness, under cross-
examination, to admit that his house had five salesmen covering California:
regularly. threÂ« In Washington and Oregon and one In Arizona, all. doing bust- .
ness at a pro flu .]','
They wili doubtless complete the presentation of their case to-morrow,
and by Friday evening their preliminary bearing ma] bo concluded and the
commission adjourned to meet at some future date on the Pacific Coast.

UNDER ARREST
Accused of Using Mails
to Defraud.

â â ]â¢â .] Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO. Nov. IB.â The Federal au
thorities to-day took cognizance of the
reports which had been made concerning
the alleged fradulent business of the
j Board of Trade firm of McLain Bros. &
Co. and arrested Charles li. and Albert
O. .Mi Lam. members of the firm. The
charge was using the United States malls
to carry on a Bcheine to defraud.
. . The prisoners were taken before United
States Commissioner Humphrey, where
they waived examination on the charge
and were held to the Federal Grand Jury !
in bonds of $SC>OO. The bail was what is |
known as a Joint and several bond, the
whole of which will be forfeited if either
or both of the defendants fall to appear
in court when called upon. The two
Board of Trade men are said to have be
gun their operations with customers in
various parts of the country two years
ago, and it is claimed they realized over
JbUO.OUU through their "bucket shopping"
scheme. They will not appear In court
again until spring, and then not unless
the Federal rand Jury finds true bills
on the charges
The members of the firm are Bald to
have "matched" buying or selling orders
from customers, with the reverse trade
on its own account and the work Is said
to have been carried on so quietly that
many customers lost money on the ficti- i
tious sales.
â¢ The evidence in the case is In the cus
tody of the postofttce officials and Is made
up "of a bundle of several hundred letters
written by the defendants to their cus- !
tomers. Some of these customers were:
JI.'M. Lloyd. Sterling, Kan.; J. J. Stevens.
l>alton. Kan., and Hunter Milling Com- |
pany. Wellington, Kan.
The warrant for the arrest of McLain
Bros, was based on the alleged swindle;
of F. A. Ilyke of Luverne. Minn , who
claims to have lost about $20,000 on his
deals with the Board of Trade firm. The I
Board of Trade rules provide that when
sales or purchases are made for the cus- \
tomer the firm: must furnish the former
with a memoranda, giving the name of '
the firm from which the purchases were
made or to which the commodity was
sold as well as the prices at which trade*
were made. The evidence in possession
Of the postal officers, letters which con- j
tain memoranda of trades made for cus- I
tomers, show that while an effort was
made to keep within the letter of the
board rules a conspiracy existed among
certain local firms to violate them. It
I is said these deals which were made by
i Mcl.ain Bros, for customers in the West ,
! were "bucket-shopped" and never reached ,
the pit. '

Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON. Nov. 15.â sessions of the
general assembly of the Knights of Labor
were continued to-day, with General Mas
ter Workman Parsons of New York In
the chair. After the appointment of com
mittees the committee on credentials re
ported that seventy delegates were pres
ent, out of a possible 105, and that several
others from Canada and the Far West
were expected to-day and to-morrow.
The afternoon session was devoted to
the reading of the reports and to an ad
dress by Charles H. Litchman, ex-secre
tary-treasurer of the order. General Mas
ter Workman John H. Parsons of New
York in his report said In part:
Since the convention at Chicago I have had
occasion to visit a number of locals. including
those of Chicago and Cleveland, and I feel
fully convinced that we are sorely in need of a
competent corps of organizers. During the
coming year the country will be again excited
over the" Issues that will arise in the contest
that will I- waged for the control of the af
fairs of this country for the succeeding four
yeais I think, therefore, that It behooves us
at this meeting of the general assembly to take
up some of these Issues In order that our rep
resentatives may be given the benefit of the
Judgment of all In the stand they may take
in the name of their order for the benefit of
the working people Perhaps the most impor
tant of these Issues will be the trusts, for who
has not observed the progress they are making
and who will contend that they carry any
charm for the wageworker? The concentration
of wealth as employed In the Industries of our
country has made many strikes during the
past few years, which have resulted to the
workingmen's detriment wherever such com
binations have been effected. It remains fur
.us to uphold the stand taken by the founders
of our order, who. through their foresight,
have seen the approach of the condition that
Ik fast coming on. How to meet It Is a ques
tion that should be given your careful consid
eration us the Knights of Labor, above nil
other organizations, will be expected to speak
on this important question.
The war Just closed with Spain has brought
us new possessions and practically a new peo
ple. How to deal with them Justly and wisely
and with a future regard for our economic
conditions Is â  question also upon which the
Knights of Labor should be heard.
The report of Secretary-Treasurer
Hayes was submitted. The report of the
general executive board was read by J. G.
Schonfaeber of Maryland. In part it says:
We beg to suggest for discussion and adop
tion at this session of the order the re-estab
llshm<nt of a defense fund. Some steps should
be taken at this session to put three or four
lecturers and organizers In the field.
Immediately after the adjournment of the
(tenrnii sssembly In Chicago the. majority of
the general executive !>oÃrd met In Washing
ton and took up the settlement of the Powderly
case. Mr Wderly agreed to accept our set
tlement and withdraw nil milts against the or
der. The secretary's report shows that Mr.
l'owderlv arcepted $I.W) as a settlement of back
snlar\- <lvÂ» him. the amount which we had at
all times Â»Â»Â»en ready to pay him In settlement
In full However, our claims against Powderly
for the use of the order's name and his serv
ices In the publication of the Labor Day An
nual remain unsettled. While the .majority
of the board are not vet satisfied as to the
be^t course to pursue In reference to this lat
ter matter, we are of the oplnivt that m.-
thing ought to be done by authority Â£>t the gen
eral assembly.

ORPHEUM GEMS AND
THEATRICAL ECHOES
First-class vaudeville Is Instructive as
I well as entertaining, and the bill at the
I Orpheum Is ample testimony to this as
; sertion.- If you visit that Justly popular
place of amusement this week a kalei
doscopic procession of vaudeville acts will
pass, before your eye that are worthy of
I your strictest attention. Leo Carle comes
I at the head of this parade with his light
! ning change nets of eight different char
acter changes, and he Is followed by
i Vinle De Witt, a cornetlst of remarkable
talent. She overcomes the technicalities
of cornet playing with a nicety that Is
: really refreshing. The trills, runs, scales
and octaves which form the various vari
ations of her solos are executed with an
t-usc decidedly praiseworthy. That Vinia
i >.â  Witt is an artist on the cornet cannot
bo disputed, although she harbors a few
stage mannerisms .which would not be
missed should she ever abandon them.
Hut the brightest star of them all Is
Marguerite Cornllle, the clever little j
French soubrette. This dashing girl is j
certainly a Jewel, for besides a distinct
brilliancy in dramatic declamation, she
sings with understanding, pronounces dis
tinctly every syllable and notwithstand
ing a brogue, which she executed In a
! bewitching manner, her English may
easily be understood Her execution is
delightful. Both as a vocalist and actress
Cornllle is entitled to first honors. Add
thereto the fact that she Is a very hand
some woman and you can picture to your
self the treat in store for you If you visit I
; the Orpheum. Cherlda Simpson plays a
piano with mandolin attachment very ef
fectively. A clever comedy sketch by
Ryan and Rttchflcld Is another feature.
The rush of seats at the box office of
the Tlvoll is another proof of the ap
preciation of the public for good per
formances. Both operas. "Patience" and
I "The Masked. Ball." captivated the audi
ences, with the result that since the first
performances the sale of seats has broken
all records. â

UNSEATING OF
SENATOR CLARK
THEIR OBJECT
Plans of Montanans Who Are
Back of the Prosecution of
John B. Wellcome.
HELENA. Mont.. Nov. 15.â case of
Attorney John B. Wellcome in disbarment
proceedings has been on trial here In the
Supreme Court for the past ten days, and
political circles are again agitated
throughout the State. Many members of
the Legislature are at the capital, and a
large number of witnesses are present
from every county In the State.
The suit was brought by the Attorney
General at the Instance of Fred White
side, ex-Senator, who seeks to deprive
Wellcome of the right to practice In the
State courts on the ground that he was
the agent of W. A. Clark during the ses
sion of the last Legislature and Improp
erly disbursed funds in the Senatorial con
test.
The Democratic party of the State Is
now, and has been for several years, dl
vided Into two factions, the controlling
forces being directed on the one side by
Marcus Daly and on the other side by W.
A. Clark. Just how. long this factional
fight has been going on no one seems to
definitely know, but all agree that it had
its origin many years ago. Twice the In
fluence of Daly, so it is claimed, has de
feated the political aspirations of Clark,
once as delegate to Congress, and again
for the United States Senate In 1893. The
strength of the Clark faction was thrown
to Helena In the contest for the location
of the capital, and resulted in the defeat
of the Anaconda Influence, and afterward
Clark succeeded In getting sleeted to the
United States Senate, so up to the present
time honors have been about even. These
contests for the political supremacy of
the State have been waged so bitterly that
It Is almost Impossible to find any one In
the State who is- not strongly In sympa
thy with onÂ« side or the other.
Both leaders are multi-millionaires,
bankers, employ a large number of men,
have newspapers to back up their opin
ions and are directly Interested in mining
and nearly every other enterprise that
has been beneficial In the material devel
opment of the State. â¢
The friends of Clark openly assert with
out reserve that the present suit is not
really directed at Wellcome, but that the
underlying motive is to establish a court
record which can be used at Washington
as the foundation of a protest against the
seating of Clark in the United States Sen
ate. The friends of Daly, on the other
hand, claim that the present action Is
purely in the Interest of honest politics,
and that Mr. Daly is not personally Inter
ested in the case. Some of them mildly
admit, however, that should the ruling of
the Supreme Court result in the disbar
ment of Wellcome the evidence would be
used In a protest against seating Clark.
While this factional warfare is being
waged by the Democrats the Republicans
are quietly encouraging the fight, hoping
to keep the party divided and thereby'

elect the next legislature and return Car
ter as his own successor to the United
States Senate.
Some of the more conservative citizens
deplore the fact that two men so closely
allied with the commercial Interests of
the State should be opposed to each other
when there are apparently so many rea
sons why they should be the best of
friends.
The case now on trial has developed
some Interesting political history and
opened again all the evidence in connec
tion with the alleged bribery case of the
last Legislature.
A:- a matter of history. It will be remem
bered that there were numerous charges
of bribery: t..at an Investigating mmmlt
t.o W aÂ« appointed: that Senator White
side produced and turned over to the
committee 00.000, which he alleged had
been given him by Attorney Wellcome to
secure his own and two other votes for
Clark. Later the matter was laid before
the Orand Jury of Lewis and Clark Coun
ty for action. After examining forty-four
witnesses the finding of the Jury was that
while there had been some evidence tf-nd-
Ing to show that money had been used in
the election of a I'nlted States Senator,
the evidence, taken altogether, was not
sufficient to warrant a conviction by a
trial jury.
After these developments J. H. Oe'<rer
Republican, of Flathead County entered
a contest for the seat of Whitestde. an-1
the Clark Democrats, voting with the Re
ptlbltcans, unseated Whltesldf and pented
Gelger. Three days later W. A. cinrk
w:is elected to thÂ»- Senate, receiving fifty
four of the ninety rotes cast. Including
the votes of Geiger and ten other Repub
licans.
In the case now on trial the proscutlon
has closed, and claims it has made a
strong easeâ just how strong remains to
be v. en after the evidence of the defense
hns been taken.
A portion of the evidence taken by the
prosecution related to conversations be
tween the members of the Legislature,
and also to the financial standing of cer
tain members before and after the meet-
Ing of thf Legislature. The defense oh
jected to thin class of evidence, and the
court ruled that conversations should bÂ«
stricken out, but that accounts of money
paid to members should remain on tnÂ«
record,
The witnesses for the defense are now
being examined. The time to-day w.is
devoted mostly to the examination <-t
character witnesses. Before beginning
the examination this afternoon chief Jus
tic.- Hrantly cautioned the newspapers
â gainst ht-lnn too tt'-f In their comment*
upon the trial. ThÂ»- chief Justice said
that the tone of certain comments upon
the trial looked as though an effort were
f>Â»-lng made to intimidate the witnesses
and Influence the court. This must stop.

JUDICIAL BLOW
AT REPUBLICANS
Decision Affecting the
Kentucky Count.
LOUISVILLE. Nov. 15.â Judge Sterling
B. Ton*>y. whose mandamus Issued on
election Cay for the admission of Honest
Election .League inspectors to polling
places caused the principal excitement of
ti.it day, and the alleged disregard of
which caused Governor Bradley to order
troop* to the pcMlng places on the evening
of November 7, was to-day restrained by
the ,^'.iie court at Frankfort from
taking any further action in the contempt
cases growing out of the order. f^
Yesterday thirty-five alleged violators
of Judge Toney's orders were bound over
by him in the sum of $500. To-day he was
proceeding with the cases and had sen
tenced one prisoner to thirty hours In jail
when the order of the appellate court
was received. The official count to-day
has brought no changes In the estimate
for Governor.
Qoebel gained 52 votes this afternoon on
the official count of the return* from this
city. It was In the First Precinct of the
Eighth Ward. Aside from this there was
no change in the situation to-day. It is
thought the canvassing of the Jefferson
County votes will be completed In a few
days. Then the whole question will be
put before the State Board, which will
meet at Frankfort some time between
now and December 4.
FRANKFORT. Nov. 15â There Is re
newed confidence around the Goebel head
quarters to-night, probably as a result of
the decision of the Court of Appeals to
day, dealing an expected blow to the Re
publicans by â  ruling which practically
decides In advance adversely the man
damus suits tiled by the Taylor attorneys
In several counties to compel the County
Election Commissioners to certify the
vote. It Is probable now that the Jeffer
ion County Board, which Includes Louis
ville will proceeed to throw out several
precincts In that city contented on
grounds of fraud, and especially where
the State militia was present or near the
polls on election day. It Is claimed here
to-night that Taylor's 21.0K) plurality in
the city of Louisville may now be almost
wiped out.

and It argues a patience almost more
than human which enable* them to en-
dure so much pain and suffering, which
the Joyful experience of their happier

escape from.
"I suffered from female sickness for
fifteen years." writes Mrs. A. C. Scott,
Le Roy. Colo., "suffered untold agonies
âdoctors could not give me any relief.
A lady friend told me to get Warner's
Safe Cure. I got a bottle and 1 helped
me right away. I have taken six bot-
tles and my health is better than it
has been for twenty years."
And Mrs. L. B. Smith of Ballstote
Spa, N. T., after recounting how shÂ«
was almost providentially led to the us#
of Warner's Safe Cure, thus recount*
the happy results: "My nervousness 1Â«
all gone; I am able to do lots of work

what I could not at one time â that Is.
that everything looks bright and life !s

County, left E.scalUer's ivsort at midnight
In company with a teamster named Ed
ward McNaraara. and .!..Â«â¢Â» Reynolds,
coflohmnn for Mrs. liarUr. The young
men strolled along the road toward Ross
Btation until they reached the Chinese
laundry, which is conducted by Ah Jim.
According to the stutementa of Jones and
Reynolds two dogs owned by the Chi
nese ran out and barked at them. Rey
nolds ricked up a few stones and hurled
them at the dogs, which were frightened
away. Two of the locks struck the laun
t'ry. but the young: tellowi thought noth
ing of ilils and continued on their way.
After they had progressed a hundred
yards they heard tha Bound of hurried
*tej>s behind them and on looking around
beheld two Chinese In pursuit, one of
*hÂ»ra carried a rifle. Seeing the gun
Jteynolds ran up the road and McNamara
Hung 1 himself down near a fence, but
Jones lui)t up his cult as if nothing
were, the matter. Suddenly thÂ« report
of a rifle rang out and Jones dropped to
the oarth with a groan of pain. Mc-
Namara then Jumped to his feet and cut
across the. JUid in the. direction of San
Ansclmo. Ah ho run the Chinese shot
once at him. but the bullet mUsed its
mark. A fuil moon was In the heavens
nt the time and a man offered a good
mark for a leaden pellet.
Returning In a short time with several
friends Reynolds procured a team and
took Jones to Ban Rafael, where Dr. W.
J. Wlckraan j>robed for the bullet but
failed to locate lv The ball entered the
back of the neck to tho right of the
cervical vertebrae and lodged at a point
where Dr. Wlckman concluded it would bo
dangerous to probe for it without a
ktiuwlMge of its exact location. Jone*
waf then carried on a stretcher to tho
ofiW ol" Dr. H. O. Howitt. After a
consultation between the two physi
cians it was dÂ«-cidtÂ»d best to send tha
woundi-d man to San Francisco, and
he Â»w first tnkÂ«n by mistake to St.
Luke's Hospital on the 11:10 a. m. train.
From St. Luke's lie was rent to the Lane
Hospital. District Attorney Mclsaac left
Ban Rafael on the 3:O p. m. train to takÂ»
Jotii-w' statement, as ho Is so weak that
his life h.is tMÂ«on despaired of.
Ah Chow >â¢â  a.i.l;. refuses to make any
rtatement, and to all Questions of the
authorities mak<-s the ono reply, "No
F.ilÂ»e." Ah Jim's laundry ... formerly
located at Hush Station, but the aristo
cratic residents of that section took of
lense at its proximity tci their Ã¼bodes and
Induet-d the own.-r of tho building to re
fuso to let It to the Chinaman any
longer. Jim then bought the property
near this ;>lace and has since conducted
his laundry there. It Is said that small
boys have frequently annoyed him by
throwing stones at his house at night
and hnve broken several windows. Think
ing that Jones and his companions be
longed to the same oC midnight
marauders it is probable that they to.ik
summary vengeance in accordance with
the true Celestial notion on the subject.
Jores* family lives at San Antonio, and
his brother Hubert is a g-uard at San
yuentin. Guard Jon>-s was deeply af
1 Â«.k t'-d when he heard of the affair to-da.y

NOT A JUROR HAS
YET BEEN SWORN
Slow Progress Made in the Trial of
Roland B. Molineux for
Murder.
NEW YORK. Nov. 15.â The trial of Ro
land R Mollneux. charged with the death
of Mrs. Katherlne J. Adams, was contin
ued before Recorder (.Jon* in the Court of
General Sessions to-day. Efforts were di
rected toward securing a jury. but. not
withstanding the fact that forty-six tales
men were examined, not one Juror was
chosen. â :. '.'â '.
I Barlow Weeks, counsel for the defense,
or one of his assistants, closely questioned
each of the talesmen, asking for deiinl
tions of terms and propounding hypotheti
cal questions until Recorder Goff severely
condemned the practice or any attempt
whatever to confuse citizens summoned
for Jury duty.
The defense used Its first peremptory
challenge late In the afternoon after Louis
Jacobs apparently passed a searching ex
amination. The defense used a second
peremptory challenge, refusing to accept
oa a Juror Richard L. Treuflurth. a for
mer steward of the New York Club after
the State had announced its willingness
to have him sit in the Jury-box.
Of those men who failed to qualify,
seven objected to the death penalty,
about the same number declared their un
willingness to convict on circumstantial
evidence, a half score were unable to de
fine the meaning of terms submitted by
thÂ« counsel, live had an Insufficient
| knowledge of the English language, and
I the others, except those peremptorily
< challenged, were excused on the various
â¢â  grounds of general consent, 111-health and
j old age.

Justed, the quarrel began afresh and Max
well opened fire with a stz-shooter, firing
six shots, one of which took effect in his
i antagonist's right thigh, wounding him

the fire with a Winchester, firing eight
shots, five of which took feel In differ-

< Louisiana State Lottery Company).COUNCIL CREATED TO HASTEN FLOOD-WATER STORAGE
THE flood water convention com- i
pitted its labors last night at Met
ropolitan Temple, after two days
of the hardest kind of work on the
part of the nearly &00 delegates. It
outlined a plan for the storage of the
waste waters of the State, and before d
journment turned it over to "The Califor
nia Water and Forest Association." a
body created by Itself for the express
purpose of carrying out its will. The j
affairs of the new association have been I
p.aced in the hands of an advisory coun- I
ell of seventy, ten from each Congres- j
fiional district, also created by the con- I
Veation. With this association now rests !
the problem of securing the aid for which
the convention was lirst called together. I
The plan for the creation of this asso- I
elation and the laws laid down for Its !
ruldanoe emanated from the committee. I
on resolutions, of which William Thomas j
of :hi.s city was chairman. The members i
of that committee arrived at unanimous j
agreement <>n *.; but one not cardinal
clause a> a result of the tw.> days' dis
cussion of the various resolutions offered !
and discus.sÂ«d in convention, ajid not as I
the n-Milt of any compromise in commit
tee. When the convention first assem
bled, it J8 true, there were radicals on !
t w.i sides, i-nnie favored Federal super- i
Vision and control of the storage work 'â 
oUi.rs wore just as pronounced for State I
expenditure and control. a few others '
vero unattached and were willing to seek I
aid from any source in sight. Tho few !
w.ro g.Â«,.d. plain business rcasoners and I
liiÂ«Â» radicals were so open, apparently to i
reason that it took only the Hood of Tight â 
thrown on the waste waters in the con- j
ventlon to head everybody in the dlrec- i
tinn taken by the committee on resolu
tions, and ratified finally by the conven
tion.
Tho one point on which five of the
twenty-one members of the committee :
differed from the majority was that con- |
tiiJuod In tho clause favoring the leasing
by the government of the public grazing '
lanae. on iul other points the minority
agreed with the majority, but. when the
majority report wa* submitted at the ;
evening session. Messrs. <Ircen and Kear- '
n>* led a determined but hopeless right ;
against the objectionable clause, which i
Wa# linaliy carri. d.
During the day the discussion on the '
various resolutions submitted was un- i
erasing, searching and instructive. The '
delegates hud broken the leo the Jlr?t day !
and took to tht- water like ducks the
siiond. StigKestions came from every ,
hand, were pertinent and helpful, and ail
morning and aftennnjn eloquence much
ettor.fier than the element under discus- i
flon vas on tap. Splendid results were!
Â«ccor.jp!i(*h-d. a* the adopt.Mi platform '
will snow; and one truly wonderful. W !
J. lay of Anaheim, who is a sort of Toon .
lin.ii down hin way. accomplii-hed th.>
vronder by deftly mixing oil and water to
the astonishment and enlight.nment of
the convention.
And now that the convention is over all
the delegate*, even thos- who opposed
the clause favoring the leasing of pub
lic grazing lands, express satisfaction at
the results attained. <) n every hand th.y !
Ray :n:it a long step has been taken to- '
ward the coal.
Immediately after the calling to order i
of the convmtlon William Thomas, chair- |
man of the cmmlitt* on resolutions re- '
l-orteti tliat the committee would recom
merÂ«l that the convention should resolve !
Itself into a permanent State organiza
tion lhe plan would I,- r.-porte,! later.'
S.-%eral rrs.,lutiotis were then introduced
t.. be to committee. The rirst of the
Juries came fmm the committee, it em- 1
â m ? ,l, l l iO ?' ns l of the resolution Intr..- i
ojcvd the day before by It. T Devlin
the purpose of which was to secure the
preservation and continuance of the State

WATER-STORAGE CONVENTION
PROMULGATES ITS PLATFORM
Tn thÂ«Â« solution of the problems of flood wat.r lit or .i Be and distribution In California was
J_ tak<-n last nSpht when the convention at Metropolitan Temple adopted the platform agreed upon by a majority
of Its committee on resolutions. The minority In that commit! agreed with all tho findings of the majority
excÂ«pt thnt nnc providing for the leasing of public grazing land*. To that It was opposed.
The platform as adopted provides for a permanent organization to be known as "The California Water and
Forest Association," Its purposes being pet forth as follows:
â Whereas, The work rf reclaiming the ex
tensive urid public and prlT&t* djmaln of
the State of California is one of great mag
nitude, requiring eventually the expenditure
of trillions of money and the work of very
many yeart of time; and
Whereas, There Ik great need of an exten
sive preliminary public educational work
..:â  â¢k- the ;â  j> of th* State In laying solid
the foundation of this great State develop
ment In order thut we may \<f able to eom
rr.ar.d the united and intelligent co-opera
tion of all the people; and
Whereas. The conservation and economical
distribution of the waters of the State Is
.!::â ! to human habitation of the arid
districts, to reasonable prosperity of the
â¢â¦mi-arii) district*, and to the full develop
ment of the humid districts, including the
conservation of fnrents.
To the attainment of this end this conven
tion propose* the establishment Â«>f a perma
nent iÂ«o<-lety wh"iÂ» meml-rshlp sha'l come
from all parts of the State, which may in
clude a* subordinates or by amalgamation
all existing societies organized for these
purposes, and which shall be endowed by
menitK-n-hlp fees, the contribution of dtl
zer.s and public bodies, with a revenue
â¢>niple for its purposes. The objects of ruck
â¢Jtaoclation Khali be ;<.Â« follows:
Storage Reservoirs.
We favor the preservation and develop
ment of our national resources by the con
struction f4 Murage reservoirs by the Fed
eral â¢ invfrnitiTit for flood protection and to
*aye Sor um> in aid of navigation and Irriga
tion the flood waters whlih now run to
waste and cause overflow and destruction.
We favor the construction by the Federal
Government of storage reservoirs and irri
gation works wherever necessary to furnish
water for the reclamation and actual settle
ment of the urid public lands.
Leasing of Grazing Lands.
We favor the leasing of the public graz
lng lands, at a nominal rental in limited
itrras to settlers farming adjacent lands.
!!,â â  ;â â  iÂ« r.ni- fr. ni i'-!ilalÂ» ta go to the PtaVf-a
and' TeTTlt'TrleÂ» wherein the lands are situ
ated for irrigation development; leases to
l-e subject to right of reclamation by Irri
gation and of nettlenient of lands actually
cultlvated; title of land to remain in Federal
Government until actual settlement; the
'.â¢..â¢: n tit said lands to be under the control
of States where sltuate<i, and the revenues
arising therefrrmi to be extended by the
States under the direction of their State
Knglne*ring Bureaus; provided, that in any
Slate having no Kngineerlng Bureau the
Federal Government may lease the, lands
and exiÂ»-nd thÂ» revenue in the construction
of irrigation works in that State.
Mr. Devlin urged that this be adopted by
tin- Â«-r.M\< â¢nti'in at Â«>nce. but withdrew his
motion alter some discussion.
A. <J. Wlshon of Fresno offered a reso
lution askiiiK Congress to legislate to keep
flh-<;> ofi .-ill forestry reservations and
blko to pÂ«*rmlt the location of reservoir
Kite* fur power and irrigation ... for
estry reservation*. Hen M. Mail I" spoke
In 115 favor, explaining thnt there wa* no
law to keÂ«-p sliÂ«-<-p fmm Government res
ervation*, only .Â» rule of tho In'.erior De
partment.
C 11. Hfinz <if Ix)s Angeles submitted
a resolution favoring th<* reclamation Of

leaving lo tlie State* the work of reclaim

the ji>^ln;tncÂ»- of the Government in the

Â«o nmended and such laws enact.-d as will
Insure to private capital already Invested
In the development of, storage and distribu
tion of water, a fair and reasonable -"turn
on the money properly and necessarily la
vested for such purposes and encourage
further investments and renewed activity
In the development of and supply of water
to the arid lands of the State; and be It
further
â '.vr.l. That while we believe In the
wlndom and Justice of the constitutional
provision making the waters of the State
appropriated for sale, rental and distribu
tion a public use and subject to State con
trol, it Is the Â»<m]-.- of this convention that
the rate* to be charted by companies, no
dealing with water should l>e determined
by some disinterested body to be provided
by IkÂ« and not. as now, be consumer* of
water furnished by Mid companies or of
flclals elected by such ont-umerH. and that
all rates should be fair, reasonable and Just.
Judge Works spoke at length to the
resolutions. He paid that he represented
water companies thai have Invested over
H.u00.000 in reservoirs and distributive
systems. He did rot represent, he said,
any antagonism ii the purposes of the
convention It was not the intention of
the constitution that men who put their
money into svHtems for providing water
should be robred.
The following resolution was introduced
by i. M. Holt:
Whereas. The people of the State of Cali
fornia an I at the arid West and of the
entire nation are Just beginning; to ap
preciate the Importance of the work of re
. : u:;i:.i. not only our extensive, and arid
public domain, but ail the tcreat and pri
vate â¢: â :â¢ -nn now In the hands of private
ownership, and
Whereas. In this frreat work we have ne-Â»d
ct the hearty financial cuppcrt of the nation
and the Stute and the Investment of private
cafltal. and
Whereas, The constitution of the State of
California and the laws made In pursuance
thereof are no unsatisfactory in their pos
sible intent that our courts after twenty
years of Investigation have been unable as
yet to construe them because of their un
certainty and the fear of possible final con
clusions. ha\e reached a point where peo
ple will not Invest their money In the con
struction of Irrigation works, thus bring
ing Urn development of our natural re
sources to a complete standstill; therefore,
be It
Resolved. That both the constitution and
limn neeÂ«l revision and we recommend the
caUlnit of a .^tate constitution*! convention
for the purpose et providing a constitution
for the â¢ tie that would be more In ac
cordance with the Ideas of our people in
the most Important and . aatlo work ever
undertaken 111 this State.
Tlesolvcd. That twenty years of failure In
our present experimental mode of operation
Is sufficient to warrant our people in de
man.i'nir a revision <<t our Â»â >â¢-â ! so that
the w heels of Industrial developivent In thin
State may not l>e forever blocked.
Mr. Holt ;i.Mr.-s-.-.l the convention in
support of his resolutions and Mr. Filcher
of the State Hoard of Trade asked Judge
Works if his resolution attacked the law
or its construction. Judge Works replied
that he attacked the law as construed by
the courts. As tho author of thÂ» law.
Mr. Filelier then arose to explain his un
derstanding of its provisions. George H.
Maxwell then took the platform to give
Ms views on the resolutions. He said in
part :
I beMeve that In the two resolutions Just
offered there has b<v-n brought before this
convention the most Important question be
fore the people of this State to-day In con
nection with lrrlÂ»ratl>- development. I wish
to say further that I believe that eveiy
or.c that has Investigated the actual con
ditions that exlrt in California will airree
that better results would exist and flow
fmm the adoption of Judee Works' resolu
tion than exist now. So far as Mr. Holt's
resolution Is concerned I sholl endeavor to
fhiiw you that everything: which he hopes
to accomplish through a constitutional con
vention can \>e accomplished under tho con
stitution and laws of California, as they
exliu f>-dny.
Judtre Works' resolution does not ask that
the State shall In any wiy yield Its ritrht
to rrirulate or control the distribution .-.'
wnter appropriated for pal usÂ«> and I
do not Interpret It as a criticism of the
present Inw, except that It may be p..s
sltV that experience has shown that â  bet

cntlon of thÂ» question? that may nrlÂ«e than

I am sure we would r< t better adjudication
Forest Preservation.
We urite upon the Coneresa of the United
States the Importance of carrying into full
effect the legislation enactf-d with a view to
securing the broadest and most effective
action by the national Government for the
preservation and reforestation of the forest
lands of our country, and the resulting con
servation of our timber and water supplies,
and systematic utilization of our lumbering
resources.
We favor the establishment of a National
Commission for the t-quit-tnle adjustment of
all differences arising fn.m the appropria
tion and ui>e Â« : the waters uf the Interstate
rivers-
We desire and urge upon the National
Government that the public forests at and
adjacent to the watershed* of our streams
be reserved an rapidly as possible, and that
pending such action no forest lands be
leased except from year to year.
State to Assume Control.
The Etate to assume such control of the
public lands as may be delegated to it by
the Federal Government, and exjt-nd the
revenues under the direction of a State en
gineer to bÂ« provided for by law, supple
menting the funds received from Federal
sources by such appropriations of its own
for the storage of flood waters aa may be
deemed advisable as to drainage basin, after
due investigation and report by the State
Engineer, which report shall show the cost
of the proposed improvement: the storage
capacity to be created; the average duty of
water in the irrigation h&sin; the \!.>-r
Of acres to I* Irrigated a* the result of

of such acreage; what *urh lands cvuld af
ford to pay for water delivered thereon;
hat power would be developed by the pro
posed improvement, and the purposes for
whl<>h and the prices at which such power
could i* sold.

|Â»ut I do not believe any change would come
in the rear that lias made capita! chary of

that modification of our present law Th*
difficulty with the Investor is this, that he
must go before a board of Supervisors or

that dlffleuty without changing the con-
Ftitution. at the name time riving to the
capitalist the most absolute protection pos-
Blt.Je. and It can I- done under the present
laws, I think this convention will have
mrule a discovery and can forth to the
l>eople and the capitalist* of the world with
Komethlmc that will Justify the calling of
thin convention.
Irrigation Investments can be made safÂ«
âthe safest Investment* In th* world that
capital can hr put Into: Irrigation specula
tlons cannot b*> made profitable because you
cannot gel enough out of the product of
the man with the hoe who tills the land
to pay the speculators' profit.
What have you got to do? Nothing In
the world except to plan roar water sys
tems upon the basts that the ownership Of
the water and thi- ownership of the land
shall b* united. Now, that Is an easy thing
to do. No man who understands the situa
tion to-day will buy an acre of land under
the water-right system. He will *Â In
under the co-operative land owners system
or not at all. Sell (took Instead of a water .
right. If you have a thousand acres of
land and have water enough to Irrigate
that thousand acres then you ran sell
shares on the thousand acres. The water
ts made appurtenant to the land.

right to the use of the water for Irrigation
shall vest In the user and become appurte

dinner adjournment..
The convention met last evening and
received the report of the committee on
resolutions, Mr. Thomas moved the
adoption of the majority report. A dis
cussion followed, the result of which was
that a minority report was voted down
and the majority report was adopted.
The minority report objected to the leas
ing Of forests outside of the reserves for
grazing. With the majority report went
the adoption of the following resolution:
Ilesolvej, That while we believe it to he our
right and duty to secure all the ail possible
from other sources. It Is the .-"i n*e of this con
vention th.it our laws should Insure to private
â Hi'ltal already or which may hereafter be In
vested in the development, storage and dis
tribution of water, a fair and reasonable re
turn on a reasonable valuation of the Invest
ment In such works of storage and distribu
tion, and encourage further Investments and
renewed activity In the development and sup
ply of water to the arid lands of the State.
Resolved, That we urge the passage of such
laws as will compel persons who have appro
priated for rale any waters under the lawÂ» of
the State of California to furnish the same to
all consumers without preference upon a rea
sonable compensation being made therefor.
Thanks were voted (the convention ris

Recommendations of the
National Grange.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BPRINGFIELD. Nov. 15.-The thirty
third annual session of the National
Grange convened in â¢ this city to-day,
wltn Master Aaron Jont-B of South â¢
1n.1.. In the chair. Twenty-six States axe
rerresented.
While the committee engaged In their
deliberations Master Jones called on
Jaben Hobinson, master of the Dominion
Orange of Canada, for remarks, and Mr.
Robinson took up the most of the morn,
ing session, bringing greetings and re-
wing the work of the year in the Do
minion. The event of the afternoon ses
sion was the annual address of Master
Aaron Jones, which, together with the
report of committees, occupied the time.
Jones began nis annual address by con
gratuiating the grange on the prosperous
condition of the order. He said iis
grange favored national and State laws
controlling trusts and State Inspection.
On the subject of transportation he said:
Transportation Is one of the moat Important
Intereata In our country, and the Just and equi
table adjustment of charges for freight and '
passengers la of utmost concern to private and
public welfare. There was In the United Statea
i^i 14 -^ :uileM of railway June SO. 1837. valued at
J10.b3j.Cv5.074. The earnings of the railways in
the United States for the year ending June Jo.
ISS7, as reported, were 11.122. â  â â¢
Our vast *ea coast, our river navigation and !
our great lakes have in service documented and
undocumented vessels exceeding eight million
tonnage. Nearly four millions of this tonnage
Is In service on the Mississippi River and Its
tributaries. On the great chain of lakes ex
tending from Minnesota to New York State
sail more .-(.., s than enter the port of Liver
pool or Load More than double the freight
pagMrs through Kault Ste. Marie In eight
months than passes through the great Sues
canal in a year. Lant year 16*,000.000 tons of ,
freight passed through Sault St.?. Marie. Our
coastwise trafilc is of the same gigantic pro
portions It has been demonstrate i that water
transportation la much cheaper than by rail i
On long distances freight can be carried by
steam for one-quarter and by sail for one-
Beventh the cost by rail. In view of these facts,
should not our order favor the improvement
of our harbors on eea and lake and keep our
rivers free from all obstructions that interfere
with navigation? Our rivers and lakes are
worth billions of dollars to the American
people. I recommend that our order favor and
Insist upon the construction by the United
States of a ship canal from the Great Lakes
to the Atlantic Ocean and also a deep water
way connecting the Mississippi River route
with the Great Lakes. These great arteries of
commerce would be worth to the American
people many times their cost and would afford
the cheapest transportation known and would
be a wholesome check on railway charges. Surh
waterways would save to the farmers over ,
$2f0.0C0.w) a year.
The construction of the Nicaragua canal by i
the United Statea would bring San Francisco.
Columbia River. Puget Sound and all oeaport
towns on our Pacific coast line 10.000 miles
nearer by water to all our cltlea on the Atlan- '
tic coast and Gulf of Mexico, and the deep wa- !
terway connecting the Mississippi River. Great
Lakes and Atlantic Ooean would enable boata
to deliver cargoes from our Pacific coast to
river and lake ports and all along the I.A. of
the ship canal.
I recommend that the National Grange con
tinue to press their demands for appropriate
legislation on the following Important matters:
Firstâ Free delivery of mail in the rural dis- ,
tricts; and that the service be placed on the
same permanent footing as the delivery of mail
in the cities and that the appropriation there
for be commensurate with the benefits aa_ '. de- '
mands for the service.
Secondâ Providing for i>osttl savings bank.
Thirdâ Submit an amendment to the constitu- i
tion providing for the election of United States I
Senator by direct vote of the people.
Fourthâ Enlarging the powers and duties of
the Interstate Commerce Commission, giving
them and charging them with the duty of fix
ing maximum rates of fare and freight on all
Interstate railways.
Fifthâ Regulating the use of shoddy.
sixth - Enact pure-food law.
Seventhâ Providing for the extension of the
market for farm products, making It the duty
of the United States consuls to aid In the ex
tending of markets for farm products as for |
manufactured articles.
Eighthâ enactment of an anti-trust law
clearly defining what acts on the part of any
corporation would be against public policy.
Ninth- speedy construction of the Nica
ragua canal by the I'nlted State*.
Tenthâ The speedy construction of a ship
canal connecting the Mississippi River with
the Great I.akeg and the Great Lakes with the
Atlantic Ocean.
Eleventhâ Revising the fees and salaries of
all Federal officers and placing- them on a
basis of similar service In private business.
We also recommend to the several State
granges that they urge on their respective State
legislatures appropriate legislation on the fol
li-wInK Important matters:
Firstâ Anti-trust law.
Secondâ Equalizing taxation as will cause all
property to bear Its Just proportion of the cost
of government.
Thlnlâ The passage of "pure-rood taw.
Fourthâ Provide a State commission with the
duty and power to fix maximum rate* of freight
and pa*engers on all railways subject to their
Jurisdiction.
Fifthâ The revision of all fees and salaries
, placing them on an equitable basis.

It is evident that the irrigation, feature of the Fe '.
cral plan has been impinged upon another policy. The
Â«Â»' Â«... â¢ . .
great \\ estern stock-raiMUg interest!;, which have long
occupied as ranges the public lands from Western
Nebraska to this coast, have enjoyed them in com
reon, and by over-stocking have fed them down until
their average capacity is about six steers to a section
of land. The large owners of herds have sought to
secure advantages by so fencing the lands they own
in fee as to inclose public land, but this process is
now outlawed by an act of Congress, ami the stock
men ''â  besieging the Government to do what it
should have done long ago â preserve the permanency
of the ranges by leasing the lands to the cattle
men. This is an enlightened imitathm of the pad
dock policy pursued in Australia, which has been the
life of the wool industry there. In order to strengthen
themselves the stockmen have succeeded in an alliance
â¢with the irrigators by getting the Misjoula conven
tion to start a propaganda for the conversion of the
proceeds of the leases into a -fund (or the construction
of reservoirs, for storage of flood waters to be used
in irrigation. To this there is no objection, except
that the capital so made available is grossly over
estimated and is ridiculously in excess of any price
which the stock interest can afford to pay for lease
hold possession of the ranges. The stockmen have
been wise in their generation. They have taken up
and own the water in all the grazing region, which is
absolutely necessary to carrying on their business. A
man who owns no â water. cannot compete for the leases
of the public graying lands, and those who do own
it. therefore, are the only ones who can bid for th
leases. The ranges arc now so overfed that years of
under-stocking will be required to restore their forage
producing capacity to what it was when the vast herd?
firtt occupied it. The fact of the gnawed-out condi
tion of these lands is a factor in fixing the leasing
price, which cann..t 1* equitably disregarded by the
Government. -It is plain, therefore, that the stock in
terests gain more than they give in the alliance with
the irrigators. but we hope their plan for leasing will
succeed and will soon be in operation, for it concern*
not only an important item in the domestic food sup
ply but an important article profitable to our export
trade
What is desirable is that the irrigators shall not be
led into dependence upon the TentoHhese lands to
speedily effect storm-water storage and be lulled into
a do-nothing policy where their own clTorts might
pioducc speedy results. As Mr. Mead has pointed
cut. California has capacities which give her a creator
interest in the subject than any other State in the
Ui.ion. Wyoming is not so much interested in irri-
KMion, perched as she is on the cold summit of the
Reeky Mountains, as she is in the leasing of the
stock ranges, so that the buffalo, bunch and gram mi
grasses and the white sage may grow again to rail
back the immense herds that made her greatest of the
grazing States.
The same is largely true of Idaho, Montana, East
ern Oregon and Nevada, to all of which we wish great
success and prosperity, which we believe can be at
tained without hurting California's development, as
it would be retarded by full commitment to â  policy
which is leÂ«s â¢: our interest than it is for the benefit
cf those other Str.tes.
The British need not be uneasy because Oom Paul

iginal anti-imperialist, with those of Senator

they had not only repudiated but had with their own

Ihc money-making idea utterly, and rebukes the spirit
Jism with which Senator Carter and
del De:iby view the whole question, and declares
that we must have an eye single to the highest inter
<â¢:> <>f the Filipinos themselves. To this end we
must of our treasure expend all that may be necessary
| to educate them, urgani/e their industries for their
benerit â not ours, raise them in the scale of existence,
do what may he done to obliterate race and tribal dis
tinctions among them, give them a sense of oneness
of interest and a common thirst for advancement and
ess. These views are humane, civilized and

division will disappear as scon as war ceases and its

In an interview on the subject Charles A. Schieren,
treasurer of the association, said to the New York
Sun: "The association cites the records of our Post
office Department to prove that merchandise could
rried in the mail"; here at about the English rate,
which begins at f Â» cents a pound and increases at the
rate of 2 cents a pound up to ten pounds The limit
is tie ten pounds and the rate for both the ton and
eleven pound packages is 25 cents. According to
the last annual report of the United States Postofficr'
Department the actual cost of transporting a pound
of mail in this country for the estimated average dis
â¢ littic under 6 cents a pound and not more
than H cents, which was the rate for merchandise in
the mails at tin- time it was changed in the early
seventies to 16 cents a pound by what was then known
as 'the great express companies job.' The Govern
ment rate is therefore now 100 per cent in excess of

actual cost on the parcels post which we now have in
this country. The rate is prohibitive and therefore
the express companies get the benerit of this discrim
ination in their favor."
The "express companies job" to which Mr. Schieren
refers is one of the scandals of our postoftice history.
The companies not only procured the increase in the
rate<; which the postomce charges for carrying parcels,
but they have also stood in the way of every attempt
to provide the people of the United States with an
adequate parcels post system. John Wannamaker,
who when Postmaster General studied the subject,
stated "there are only four great objections to a
parcels post in the United States, and they are the
four great express companies." The issue before the
Manufacturers" Association, therefore, is to overcome
the corporation lobby at Washington, and in that
â¢ the association should have the cordial support
of the press Â«nd the people.
The time is propitious for the contest. By the
open and defiant shirking of the war tax the express
companies have revealed something of the extent of
their greed and aggressiveness. The people are there
lore ready to grapple with them in earnest. It is in-
tolerable that great improvements and extensions of
the postal facilities of the country should be blocked
by corporations which, not content with what thfy
have gained from the public in that way, have shifted
their share of the taxes made necessary by the war,
and have defied the decisions of the courts declaring
it to be the duty of the express companies to affix
the revenue stamps required by the law.
The issue is one of far-reaching importance. A
parcels post system is one of the needs of civilized
countries. It is more needed in the United States
than in any other country, and yet we lag behind
Europe in the establishment of such facilities. It is
gratifying to have the subject taken up by so impor
tant an organization as the Manufacturers' Associa
tion, and it is to be hoped the movement for reform
will be pushed vigorously.
The desperate San Quentin convict who murder
ously attacked his keeper and was then saved by a
rope from drowning will probably discover that there
is more than one sensation in dangling from the end
of a rope.
POPE LEO XIII will be ninety years old next
March. He is hale and serene in his old age,
but at ninety years human life is very frail. It is
liable to pass away in a night even when there is no
particular malady or ill to hasten its departure. There
fore there is incessant speculation going on concern
ing the succession, and we may be sure the speculation
is accompanied in some quarters by quiet efforts to
direct the course of events and determine beforehand
accessor shall be.
For that reason more than ordinary interest at
taches to the recent dispatches to The Call concerning
the men who are supposed to be most likely to suc
ceed Leo. Our dispatches report Cardinal Gotti to
be seemingly highest in favor at the present time, and
a similar view is taken by other authorities who have
made public expression of opinion on the subject.
The London Spectator, for example, in a review
of the chances of the probable candidates for the
office, pointed <>ut that an Italian is almost certain to
be chosen, partly because a lar^e majority of th~
I ardinals are Italian and as the governing committees
of the church are centralized in Rome they would not
like a f'.ni^ner to preside over them, but mainly be-
cause there are such, international enmities among
British, French, Germans, Austrians and Slavs that
a candidate of either of those nations would meet the
antagonism of all the others. It suggests that a Car
dinal from the United States would probably meet
no hostility in Europe, but might find it from the
Spanish-American countries, and the chances of such
a candidate are therefore no better than that of one
from Germany or France.
The choice being virtually confined to Italians, the
Cardinals in choosing a new Tope at this juncture
will undoubtedly seek for a man satisfactory to other
nations as well a = to Italy. The Spectator concludes
that the conditions of the time will lead to the exclu
rrom the field of choice of all conspicuous and
well-known Cardinals except Cardinal Gotti. whom
the Pope is said to favor as his successor, Cardinal
Jacobini and Cardinal VannutellL It was said in our
dispatches that Vannutelli is favored by the "Ameri
canists." but the word must not be confounded with
Americans, for it is used to signify the supporters
of a certain policy to which the name "Americanism"
has been given by those who oppose it.
While the prospects at present presage the choice
of one of these three, and the character and disposi
tion of each is being widely discussed, it is to be re
membered that in Papal elections, as in everything
else, there i< many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip.
The venerable Pope may outlive the men who are
now suggested as his possible successors, r id, more
over, when the test of comparative strength comes
the three leaders may defeat one another and leave an
avenue open for some other Cardinal who is unknown
to fame and not thought of as a candidate.
A dispatch from Kansas contains the information,
that Brigadier (icncral Funston fears there will be
no more fighting to do by the time he reaches the
Philippines. What's the odds? He will find more
than one river to swim.
Admiral Crowninshield has taken a second thought
and. having thus amended his ideas, has proceeded to
amend his report. We have thus a double improve
ment, one in the man and another in his words, so
let us be thankful.
Latest London advices are to the effect that the
British War Office has accepted a gift of 10.000 plum
puddings lor the troops in South Africa. Who will
deny now that the fates are not on the side of the
Boers?
What may be characterized as "The Great Puzzle
of the Philippinesâ Tlow to Capture Aguinaldo." is

There are no indications of an early solution of the
puzzle.

THE PAPAL SUCCESSION.
DOOR OF REFUGE.
THIS thing, which Is not .it all pretty, has the distinction of having been
perhaps the loveliest and most beautiful right that many men ever sawâ at
I that time. The time referred to was when they were racing for life. Then,
tho slKht of this ugly piece of metal was finer that anything else In the
world could have been to them, because It was the knocker on the door of
the Mnctuary of St. Cuthbert In Durham Cathedral.
in the <>id times criminals who could reach the sanctuary before their pur
suers got th.m were housed, fed and protected .< tliii t v-s.-\ . n days during
which time Dot eren the Kins mlj;ht h.irm th.'m. If this old Inwfcer could
speak, there would come from it thrilling and ram and sorrowful stories. The
hands of nobles and nf beggars, of vile murderers and i â¢ women of
Swaggering duolists and of Rontlomen of the road, all hare Wielded It lustily and
anxiously. The last one to touf-h it and to claim sanctuary was admltta

WHY WEBSTER
GOT HIS SALARY
Ex-Aud!tor Broderlck Explains a
Point In School Department
Salaries.
Editor Pan Francisco Call-in an arti
cle published In The Call of November
14. headed -w Found a Golden
Windfall." I think some Injustice has
been done, and I therefore bÂ«u leave to
make or surest some correction. Al
thoiiKh th' subject matter of tho article
Is now two and a half years old. I have
very distinct recollection as to the whip.
The article r*cltes that Mr. Webster
wns elected Superintendent of Schools In
I>>>; that Habcock, the Incumbent, re
fused to turn over the office: that Web
ster Institute-*] suit In I*>> and obtained n
favorable decision in March. U97. and
that "durlnji the two and a half months
the action was pending, however. Ha brock
continued to present his salary warrants
and Auditor Hrod.-rlck honored them. In
stead of holding thorn up until such time
as a decision should be hamled down."
I p to IMÂ»l in such a contest, under Â«ec
tlon fttf of the Political Code, the AudjtÂ»r
would have been obliged to hold all such
claims, but In isai that section was
annnded, making specltlc provision and
direction for the payment of the salary
of annfllre to an incumbent discharging
the duties of the office during the
pendency of a contest, the same as If no
Â»uch contest or proceeding was pending.
Mr. Bahcock received the* salary of thÂ«
"Hi" â¢â¢> under tli in provision of law. and la
therefore under no obligations whatever
to the Auditor. His demand and warrant
was leral and could not be denied or ro
fuscd.
The article also stated that upon Mr.
\\ebster obtaining the ofnee he presented
claims for salary from January 1 (should
be December 2l> to March 25. 1*37. "but
Hroderlck held them up on the rround
that the salary had been paid to Dahcock.
Webster contended that Habeock had no
rlÃht to draw It. but ISroderick was ob
durate, and Webster finally let tho mat
ter pass."
This statement Is absolutely erronecis.
Mr. Babco< receipt of the salary nad
nothing whatever to do with the cause of
my refusal to pay Mr. Webster the salary
of Superintendent of Schools. Mr. Web
ster. In my Judgment then, and In :ny
JudKment now. had deliberately by his
own action become disqualified and had
forfeited any riKht he mlpht have had to
such salary. Had he not done so tho
Auditor should and would have allowed
the salary on the face of the decision. Hh
would have hid the same right to salary
as thÂ» reinstated teacher has who obtains
salary notwithstanding another teacher
has been paid for teaching the class dur
' ii k the pendency of suit ,for reinstate
ment.
Section I*ii3 of the Political Code pre
scribes that "no School Superintendent
who receives an annual salary of Sl.ViO or
more, must follow the profession of teach
ins, or any other vocation that can con
flict with his duties as Superintendent,
' but those recelvhiÃlf'SH ... may teach
In public schools of this State."
Mr. Webster pr# rented demands' for m!
ary properly allowed and audited by tho
Board of Education as teacher In thÂ«
Polytechnic Hljjh School, and recelwd
mini thereon for the month of De
cember, isae. and the months of January
and February. IW. If.- was admonished
and advised at the tlmo by the Auditor
that he was perhaps Jeopardizing his riirht
to the salary nf Superintendent in the
event of the decision being In his favor.
There was considerable doubt as to tho
outcome of the contest, and Mr. Wtb.tter
may have considered "a bird In the hand
better than two In a bush." As he so
willed It. I allowed him the bird In the
hand, lie has now. It .Â«eems. caught tho
I two that were In the bu.Â«h two and a half
years aÂ»to. I thought Mr. Webster was
entitled to but one salary under thÂ« pro
visions of the. law. and he forced me to
allow and pay that of the teacher during
unccrtiilncy __ â _-.- -_ Therefore
the city was entitled. In my Judgment, to
the benefit of his deliberate and volun
tary action of disqualification. Respect
fully. \V. HKODERICK.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 15.-In view of
the reported Imminence of war between

Korea, statements nude to-riay i.y Alex
Pavloff. the Russian Mlni.-ter to Korea
who happens to he In Washington as the
pii. -st of Count Casslnl, the Russian Em

important. Mr. Pavloff is an accom

Russia acquired Port Arthur and Tall.-n
War,. ai..l later was advanced to the poet

spoke quite frankly of the recent war

I* n<> basis whatever for report! of
a conflict between Russia and Japan over

compacts irere concluded at st Peters

that the reports of conflict as to suzer

Russia and Japan are maintaining toward
Kor'-n.
"The war rumors appear to be based
on an alleged conflict over the port of

Of I In- new treaty ports on the southern
coast of Korea. There has bean DO ques
tion as to the freedom of the port to Â«U
nations alike and no questions of fa\ r
or discrimination between Russia and Ju
pan h.tve occurred as to this port. But
a purely personal and private difference
arose some months ago as to the owner
ship of certain lots at Masanpo. Russian
residents had secured a ritfht to purchase
the lots and were waiting the assent of
tho Korean Government. Pending this
; Japanese citizens purchased the
same rights. This, however, was purely
a private difference. In which the Govern

KILLED BY HIS
OWN DEATH-TRAP
Peculiar Ending- of Nel
sen Swansen's Life.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
LOS ANGELES. Nov. 15.â Family rows,
business troubles and a suspicious mind,
which framed the Idea for construction
of a death-trap, resulted this morning In
the sudden death of Nelsen Swansen. The
death-trap Is said to have been construct
ed for the express purpose of catching
William Petersen, known as "Dead
Horse" Pete. Swansen's brother-in-law,
but the trapper was trapped. After be
i Ing shut in the chest Bwansen was taken
! to the Good Samaritan Hospital. He died
' at 1:50 o'clock this afternoon.
Swansen came to America from Sweden
twenty years ago. For three years he
has lived in Los Angeles. His only rela
â¢ ttves In this country are the wife of hli
partner and a brother, who lives in the
northern end of the State. His father
and mother still live In Sweden.
All disagreements originated over the
dead-horse and fertilizer bunlness which
was conducted by Swanscn and Petersen.
About two months ago the two men had
trouble over money matters. There were
debts and accusations on both sidw. The
case wus carried into the courts. There
were several plants owned by the two
men, Including thtÂ» fertilizer works and
the fertilizer screening business.
An engine In the works was Swansen's
special pride. To keep Petersen from
tampering with it hfl erected a trap that
rt.ii a thirty-, lght caliber revolver.
From the trigger a string led to the oaken
door. A mark on the floor indicated how
far it could be opened. "When he this
morning attempted to enter the room the
mechanism rebelled. A sudden push
caused the door to swing too far. A shot
Btartk'd every one In the building. A bul
let hole, true to aim, above the heart
extinguished the life of the contractor.
ROBERTS' WIFE MAKES
SERIOUS CHARGES
Says That Her Recreant Husband
Took Money to Vote for Har
vey's Acquittal.
FAN RAFAEL, Nov. 15â The woea of
John P. Roberts, the plasterer, who ran
away from home in company with a Mrs.
Nelson a few months aÂ«o and left a wife
ami several children penniless, have
reached a crucial point, and It Is probable
that for the first time the erring man
realises that the path of the wicked Is
thorny. Roberts was arrested In 3an
Frandaco to-day by ronstable Agnew on
a charge of "battery preferred by his wife,
and brought to this city. In order to ex
; â¢â¢â  matters Agm-w had one charge of
battery pending against Roberts In San
Francisco <li?mi> â¢
In addition to Urn charr* of battery pre
ferred against him. Mrs. Roberts will
proâ CUte her husband for failure to pro
vide. The defendant was talppn before
Judge Gardner, but failed to give hall and
was Incarcerated In the County Jail. He
waited all afternoon for the arrival of hla
attorney. Walter Gallagher, but the law
yer <liil not make his appearance.
Roberts is accused by his wife of recetv-
Intf money to vote for an acquittal in the
case of Jo- Harvey, the gambler, who
was prosecuted last June 'or conducting
a banking game in mnnci lion with his
poolrooms at Hiiu.iallto. The Jury failed
to agree on the first trial, and Harvey
was anjultted by a second Jury. Mr*.
Roberts says her husband told her Har
\ < v bad lent money to San Rafael to oe
divided amoiiK thrÂ»-e Jurymen, and there
fa la been Mm<> talk of bringing the mat
t.r to the attention of the Grand Jury.
which will convene on the 20th lnst. This
Is ri"t likfly to be done, as Mrs. Roberts
Is the only witness and she could furnish
nothlnp but hearsay evidence. In addi
tion, her animus against her husband is
clear on account of his treatment in de
serting her and taking up with anotner
woman.

ROBERTS SAYS HE
WILL NOT RESIGN
Mormon Church Has Absolutely
Nothing to Do With His
Political Life.
NEW YORK. Nov. 15 â Congressman
B. H. Roberts of Ttah. who Is at present
In this city, to-day denied the report that
he Intends to resign hla seat shortly after
Congress meets in pursuance of the
wtsh.-s of the elders of the Mormon
Church.
"1 have seen many such stories since I
came But." said Mr. Roberts, "but there
Is absolutely no truth In them and abso
lutely no basis for the statements. I will
say as emphatically as I can say It that
I don't Intend to resign and never had any
such Intention since my election. I was
fairly elected and propose to light It out
to the end with all the vigor at my com
mand. Those who know me are aware
of this Intention on my part and will not
credit these reports, no matter In what
form they may be couched.
"I have aluo heard it said and have
| seen It In print that the presence of many
Mormons of Influence in New York at the
I present time ts for the purpose of ln
duclns me to resign my seat and go back
to I'tah. Aa a matter of fact, there has
never been a suggestion made from any
Mormon elder or Mormon Influence- that I
should resign.
"The Mormon church haa no more to do
with politics than the Episcopal church
or the Roman Catholic church. It Is not
In politic*. I was elected on purely po
litical lines and will go to Congress abso
lutely free of this so-called church influ
ence over me."
SANTA FES GENERAL
MANAGER RESIGNS
J. Frey "Will Quit the Service of the
Road at the End of the
Year.
TOPEKA, Kans.. Nov. 15â J. Frey, gen
eral manager of the Atchlson. Topeka
and Santa Fe, to-day announced that he
had tendered his resignation of that posi
tion. It Is said that Vice President Rob
ert Barr will succeed Mr. Frey as general
manager, retaining, too, his present title.
"My resignation is in the bands of the
president, effective on January 1." said
Mr. Frey. I will say that I will continue
In railroad work, but will not at thla time
divulge the character of it. I have noth
ing to say as to the reasons for resign
ing and will pass the various rumors con
certed without notice."

to say. Rumors of his resignation had
been afloat since July 1 last. The suppo

BATHOS WON
STAKE AT
TANFORAN
Bit of Fashion Ran Second,
Hopelessly Broken Down.
Favorites Beaten.
Oame as a fighting cock, small of con
formation but all horse. Bathos, the Mon
tana-bred youngster, captured the Stan
ford .stakes at Tanforan Park yesterday
In Impressive fashion. With plenty of 6
to 1 about him In the betting, he made
Corrlgan's St. Caslmlr quit like a "yaller
dog," and then led Bit of Fashion out
two lengths, splashing the seven furlongs
off In 1:33^. An unfortunate incident In
the race was the hopeless "breakdown"
of the latter filly, favorite In the betting,
which ruptured the suspending ligament
of her front legs and will probably have
to be retired. It was no doubt due to
stepping In a hole; pitfalls to be found
In abundance at the new track. Plomed
ran a good third. The winner was fault
lessly ridden by Ruiz.
It was again a tempestuous day for
form players, but two choices. Obsidian
and Afumada, taking purses. The "old
man." as Charley Thorpe is affectionately
termed by his friends, put up two grand
rides, and all Jockeys looked alike to him.
In the second event, with the leg up on
Obsidian, lit' downed Bullman on Casdale
a head In the prettiest finish of the meet
ing, nd In the sprint following he piloted
Mike Rice in ahead of the favorite, Wyo
ming, carrying Kingpin Spencer.
By very careful nursing and a well
timed drive Eddie Jones landed The Buf
foon, a 4 to l chance, first for the opening
two-year-old dash. Giro was installed
favorite, and after leading into the stretch
fell back, finishing third. Buffoon at the
end was given a sharp argument by
Chateau, getting the decision by half, a
length. â¢
Obsidian, the entry of Burns & Water
house, carrying 117 pounds, had a strong
call In the betting on the mile run follow
ing. Thorpe gradually ran down El Estro.
but was In turn passed at the stretch
bend by Casdale. Opposite the paddock
it looked all off with the favorite, when
by an electrifying display of horseman
ship Thorpe fairly lifted Obsidian to the
front, winning by a head. El Estro was
third.
Stealing away from thÂ« barrier first,
on Mike Rice. In the next event a six
furlong selling sprint, Thorpe kept the
third choice in the lead to the end At
the who he downed Wyoming, a 3 to 10
favorite, by more than a length. Show
honors went to Alaria.
Judge Wofford repeated his victory of

Is. "How long will Tanforan stand the

new course Ims been playing to light
houses, with probably a dally loss of over
â $1000. As at InglcMde in the days gone
by, F. 11. Qreen acts as secretary. The
milk men of the State pay Mr. Green
makes â  swell secretary, but the horse
men think the gentleman an Ideal mlik
man. Mr. 'Green Is so enlightened per
taining to matters of the turf that he
usually takes shelter behind his hirsute
appendage, when consulted on any knotty
problem by owners. The new track has
ptrlven hard to hide the Identity of Ed
Corrigan with its management, but ns he

tlllerman of Tnnforan.

HARES PROVE SCARCE
BUT SPORT IS FINE
Interstate Coursing Club Members Trav
erse Much Ground in Pursuit
of Game.
MBRCBD, Nov. 15.â Harea are to Mer
ced County very much like snak* s
to Ireland; that Is the â¢>;
of many of the coursing men who
are at present gathered In Merced
for the annual open meeting of the Inter
state Coursing Club. Merced was sup
posed to he the very browsing ground of
rabbits, and that til why the Interstate
Coursing Club selected it for the scene of
Its annual meetings. All of to-day was
consumed in scaring up nineteen hares,
and the first round of the programme was
not completed. Hut rabbits alone were
lacking. In the aft- moon a rainstorm
soaked the country and Incidentally every
| follower of the hound.-. It was none of
the "gentle rain that falls from heaven."
but the pelting kind that soaks through
any Imagined protection. To make things
altogether pleasant, a thunder storm was
worked in as a musical accompaniment.
At a very early hour of the morning the
coursing menâ or the "dog men," as the
Merced people call themâ left town In
every description of vehicle, led by a cor
don of mounted patrolmen, whose especial
duty It was to keep the crowd from en
croaching upon thÂ« slipper. About twelve
miles to the northwest of the town the
procession halted and the coursing began.
Judge John Grace was In the saddle and
James Grace In charge of the slips.
T. J. Mclnernejr, who runs Father M^-
Namara's 1 wnrnÂ»-d the coursing
men that hares w.-re rare la Merced
this time. He certainly knew whereof he
â poke, for !t was some ten minute* after

sighted.

GOOD GAME
IS PROMISED
FOR SUNDAY
San Francisco and Sacramento
to Meet for the Last Time.
Gossip of the Players.
The games this week excite a great deal
of Interest. Santa Cruz and Oakland
play Friday, Saturday and Sunday at the
Oakland grounds. The winner of this
series will be safely anchored In third
place. San Francisco and Sacramento
play three games here this week on
Saturday and a game In the forenoon
and one In the afternoon- at Recreation
Park on Sunday. These games are always
looked forward to with Intense Interest,
as the two teams always play Interesting
games. Both clubs are on their mettle
ns the result of the three games will
probably decide the championship. In
view of the sensational eleven-inning
game last Sunday In which neither team
scored a run, a genuine battle may be
expected.
Harper is the first man signed In the
California League for 1900, having been
signed to a Sacramento contract. He Is
billed to pitch one of the three games
this week.
Dreeman of the Santa Cruz and Shana
tian of Sacramento have been offered
Eastern engagements.
Harvey and the Chicago club are hav
ing some trouble In coming to terms.
The Chicago club offered him 1300 a
month, but he Is holding out for $;{,Â».
Strenuous efforts are being made to In
duce Kill Lange to continue his pro
fessional career, an Increase of $>Â«) hav
ing been offered him to continue with
Chicago for liM.
Hughes' aim Is troubling him sor.ie
what, and he has placed himself under
the Care of physicians to take the kinks
out of his arm.
The backers of the Kansas City club
are hard at work trying to gel possession
of Sullivan and Iberg of the Han Fran
cisco, club. Manager Harris la loth to
lose such good players, and win make .1
hard tight to retain them. He refuses to
soil cither man. and will not give then
up unless he Is compelled to do bo by the
draft system In vogue. Harris is actively
engaged In the perusal of the National
League agreement, and hopes to be abiÂ«
to bold both players.
Umpire Graves la recommending too
many players in Eastern leagues to unit
the directors of the California League.
Some of the latter believe that Graves Is
getting l' 1 gether too officious and that he
is returning kindness In a very peculiar
way. For every man he recommends to
another league and who Is accepted
Graves drawn down a commission, and
this has led him to do too much of that
sort of thliiK. It has a tendency to make
a player think that h. in Indispensable,
and he play* ball in the belief that if his
captain does not like his work on the dia
mond sonic other league does.
It Is udmittÂ»-d that empire Graves râ¢â â¢Â»
â ease* good judgment, ns he has had a
good deal of experience and Is In a posi
tion to Judge a player's qualities. Wnen
In recommended l'lcnnan to a minor
league he was ;>-kiil why ! â¢â¢ did not men
tion Moakltnon for the place, as the lat
ter I* considered to be a Rtai fielder.
Graves replied that Moaktmon shirked his
work; that he did nothing but stand In
the field and ratch fly : .ills, and when at
bat would try. to make n hit; that he
would not rci'imimcml a player who was
not In the game nil the time. He said he
liked tn *Â«â¢Â»â¢ a man K*>t on the coaching
line and wham that he is In earnest and
wants his team to win out. McLaughlln
of Sacramento is another such a player
ns >klmon. Hrockhnff and Kellly are
the kind Graves admires, because they
are always In the game. Rellly has a
temper, but he tries to restrain It on the
diamond. Hellly went to Sacramento test
Sunday determined not to say a word
having In mind his fight with Dever*a>ut
at V.-illeJo the week before, but when in
the very last Inning O'Connell called him
out at third Relily could not restrain him
self, and he turned loose on the umpire
"Ham" Iburg has quite a few votes to
his credit In the contest of the most pop
ular player In the league. A number of
his friends have nearly 700 votes In readl
; Cast
the finest, for every hare was strong Â«rd
fast, giving the dogs more work thin
they were capable of standing. With but
few exceptions the hares were lost or
holed, a killing rarely being made. The
courses were long ones and would havo
been very trying on the dogs were It not
for the cool weather and the good going.
Winners were divided between favorites
and long shots. The very first rare, that
of Jesse Moore and Jenny Wilson, was
won by the former on the short end of a
1 to 2 chance. Honadca defeated Fireball
at 1 to 2. Depend On Me walked awny
from Rest Assured, though the latter was
favorite at 2 to 1. Ida. selling at 2 to 5,
won from Victor. Lady Davenport. 1 to 2.
won from Belle of Anderson by a score
of 11 to 5, and Sun" won from Firm
Foe. which was a 2 to 1 favorite. Rest
Assured and Depend On Me ran a no-go
the first time they started, but the second
race went to the latter. Sunolite and
Firm Foe a'so ran a no-go. Sunolite won
out the second slip in taay fashion.
The last race of the first round was pc
cullar In accidents. Thrice Dempsey Ln.Â«s
and Tic Tac were clipped, but there was
no race on account of a falling to sight
by the dogs. About fifteen miles of Mer
ced County were traversed by the crowd
which followed the dogs, and when the
sport ended for the day the spectator*
were eighteen miles from the town. The
second round, semi-finals and finals, will
be run to-morrow.
The results of the first round are:

At the regular meeting of the Board of
Health last night Dr. Co Hey referred to
th.- deplorable condition of the Pesthouse
in which the nineteen leprous wards of
the city are eottftaed, and requested the
board to take mom immediate nmion t.Â»

they preferred romainlng in the lllthy.

osasttiss. He waa heartily second.-! by
Dr. Payne and Dr. Harbat. and a rei>

the whole and make, urgent request lor
the needed Improvements. On motion of
Dr. Coffey, the salaries of the steward
and nur*e at the Pesthouse were raised
from $40 V ITS per month.
Health Officer Lawlor took advantage
of the cricTtunity to announce that an
other case of smallpox had been discov

their case reviewed by some authority

honor.
The men were accused by a photogra

camera. He complained first to the col

two policemen were sent out to the Pre

Court, but notwithstanding the colonel of
the Thirty-fourth asked thai the mÂ»-n bo
discharged without honor, they being In
the hands of the civil authorities, and
this was done in an order from army
headquarters.
.The men say the photographer left his
camera in one of the company streets and
then members of the company garnered
around and took pictures of one another
in his absence. They say there was no
malice in their action, and they did not
think the photographer had any right to
take pictures In the camp anyway The
discharge without honor deprives them
of their travel pay, and they are here I]
the city without money or friends. They
claim the discharge was Issued under a
misapprehension, as they were not in the
hands of the civil authorities any longer
than was necessary for the Judge to dis
miss the case against them.

kind can be Issued except after sentence

(Concluded.)
Selected Critical Studies.
The story of Gloucester nnu hiÂ« nons
Is a counterpart to that of l.tar and his
daughters. Gloucester Is credulous and
superstitious. and for breadth and
grandeur of character Is not to be com
pared to Lear; but he ranges himself on
the side of mercy and Justice, and his
treatment of Edgar has more excuse than
Lear's treatment of Cordelia. Like I^ar.
his repentance when be li undeceived Is
sincere, and. like him. his frror Is ex
plated with his life. ESdmnnd'i entangle
ments with Uoneril and R"p;rin furnish
the link which binds the two stories to
gether. Thoroughly committed to both
of them, their cause becomes his. and It
Is mainly to his energy that the victiry
of the British forces Is due. It Is owing
to the discovery of.Gonertl's letter to rim
that his villainies are finally unmasked,
not the least of which was his order
for the â¢â¢xecvtlon of Cordeliaâ an order
which a deathbed repentance revokes when
It Is too 'ate. The part played by Edgar
also has Its relation to the main plot;
his assumed madness, seconded by the
witticisms of the fool, renders the real
madness of Lear less terrible, and It Is
SAMUL PHFIPS.
The most notable tribute paid to Shakespeare by any
actor-manager of recent times was paid by Samuel Phelps,
who gave during his tenure of Sadler's Wells Theater be
tween 1 & 44 and lSfi2 competent representations of all tho
plays save "Trollus and Cresslda" and "Titus Andronicus."
âSidney Lee.
through his Instrumentality that tne
final catastrophe Is brought about.âHer
bert A. Evans.
Lear Is 'he greatest sufferer In Shakes
peare's plays; though so old. he has
strength which makes him a subject lor
prolongÂ»-Â«l and vast agony, and patience
is unknown to him. The elements
to have conspired Hgainst him with his
unnatural teophters; the upheaval of the
moral world and the ragv of tern;

hair bitterly, half under!?, and always
with a pad remembrance of the happier
past. The poor hÂ«j's henrt has been sore
ever since his "young mistress w> Q1 to
France."â Kdward I towden.
In "Othello" the tragedy turns upon the
rending of the borri
and wife. In "King Lear" ihe tragedy la
that of violated filial ties, and of father
saved â and scarcely savedâ from th
Â«j.a!r following upon unnatural cruelty by
the redeeming passion of |OT< In one
daughters hÂ»Hrt. The srnle on which
everything Is presented In this drama
borders on the titanic. Tbe couble plot
heightens and intensifies the effect.
Gloucester's wrong and Gloucester's
suffering are great, but they fall well
within the limits of humanity. The pas
sions of Lear almost break the bounds;
there Is in them something vast and ele
mental, and nature herself, with her
deluging streams and fierce thrusts of
lightning and reverberating thunders,
seems to partake In and to reflect thÂ«
chaos of the moral world. Where hatred,
deceit and egoism are outragrous love Is
deep and still, a pure and quiet :ount of
blessing; Cordelia utters no passionate
outcry, hut all that Is of virtuous power
in the play organizes Itself about her, or
unconsciously takes part with her. She
dies as the martyr of love, but when her
father falls upon her body nnd his strong.
worn heart at last breaks through exioss
of strain, he Is looking for that unmterÂ«*l
word of love from her lips, the very tx>
pectatlon of which has saved him from
despair nnd moral death. Cordolla dies,
but love is not defeatedâ Edward Dow
den.
"Kins Lenr" Is the greatest task
Shakespeare ever set himself, th.- most
extensive and the most imposingâ all the
suffering and horror that can arise fr -n
the relation between a father and hlÂ«
children, expressed In tlve acts of mod
erate length.
No modern mind has dared to face such
a subject; nor could any one have grap
pled with It. Shakwpeare did bo without
even a trace of effort, by virtue Â»t thÂ»)
<>vi r| oworlng mastery which he now. In
the meridian of his genius, had attained
over the whole of human life. He handles
his theme with the easy vigor that be
longs to spiritual health, though we have
here scene upon scene of such Intense
pathos that we seem to hear the sobs of
suffering humanity accompanying the ac
tion, much as one hears by the seashore
the steady plash and sob of the waves.
Under what conditions did Shakespeare
take hold of this subject? The drama
tells plainly enough. He stood at the
turning point of human life; he had lived
about forty-two years; ten years of life
still lay before him. but of these certainly
not more than seven were Intellectually
productive. He now brought that which
makes life worse than <J>>ath face to face
with that which makes life worth livingâ
the very breath of our lungs and Cor
della-Uke solace of our sufferingâ and
swept them both forward to a catastrophe
that appals us like the ruin of a world.â
George Brandes.
The fool, the best of Shakespeare's fools,
made more conspicuous by coming after
the insignificant clown in "Othello. 1 * I*
such an echoâ mordantly witty, marv.-l
ously Ingenious. He Is the protest of sound
common sense against the tooIMUMM
of which Lear has been guilty, but a pro
test that Is pure humor. He never com
plains, least of all on his own account.
Yet all his foolery produces a tragic el-
I feet. And the words spoken by one of
' the knights. "Since mv young lady's go
| ing Into France, sir. the I ."I hath much
pined away," atone for all his sharp
I speeches to I^ar. Among Shakespeare's
i other mauler strokes in this play must bÂ«
reckoned that of exalting the traditional
clown, the buffoon. Into ?o high a sphere
that he becomes a traffic element of the
. first order.â George lirandes.
That this old man should I â >Â«Â« his
youngest daughterâ this i* the catastro
1 phe which Shakespeare has ma so
i great that it is with reason Kent asks:
| "Is this the promised end? Is thin thÂ«
i end of the world?" In the lon of this
I daughter he loses all; and the abyss that
I opens seems' wide enough and deep
i enough to engulf a world.
ThÂ»' loss of a Cordeliaâ that li the rrÂ»nt
i catastrophe. We all lose, or live und^r
I the dread of losing:, our Cordelia. The
| loss of the dearest ami best, of that
i which alone makes life worth livingâ th.it
Is the tragedy of Ufa Hence the question:
i Is this the end of the world? Tea. It is.
: Ea^h of ms has only his world, and lives
I with the threat of Its destruction harm
i ing over him. And In the year l 4)Â«
Shakespeare was In no mood to write
other than dramas on the doom of other
1 worlds.â Geonce Itrandes.
The elements of greatness In Lear's
character are not apparent when
Iwe first see him In the open

only too patent. Â»lÂ»

Questions for Research and Review.
I. Is It Liar's sin against Cordelia and
Kent (In the first scene) or his folly In
dividing the kingdom and putting power
In bad hands that create* the basis of
th.- tragedy? Is Cordelia at all blamable
In the first scene? What is Lear's mental
condition as the play opens? At what
point does he really go mad?
â¢. What parallelism Is there between th*Â»
characters of the main plotâ (1) Lear, (2>
Cordelia and Kent. (3) Gonerll and Regan
âand those of the secondary plotâ (1)
Gloucester. (ti Edgar. (3) Edmund? How
do their dramatic functions compare, or
contrast, pair for pair?
3. Which characters of the play have a
part in both main and secondary plot,
serving to weave the two together? la
what sÂ«cenes Is this accomplished?
4. What is gained for the advancement
of the plot by Introducing Gloucester Into
the scene it the hovel after Edgar and
Lear have been brought together*
5. The visit to Gloucester's ca*tle bring"*
what elements of the play together? De
termines what Issues? Leads to what
new ventures?
6. Has Edmund's villainy any excuse?
Is Edmund a Richard 111 on a smaller
scale? As an Intriguer, how does he mea
sure with Iago?
7 How much of the play Is devoted to
bringing about the destruction of Ed
mund? By what means In the case of,
Goneril. Regan and Edmund is evil shown,
to work Its own ruin?
8. What mitigates the horror of tho
scene in which Gloucester Is blinded?
9. Are the crimes of Gonertl and Regan
monstrous beyond belief?
10. What Is the function of the fool
In this play? Merely to afford relief from
so much horror? Should we understand
Lear as well without him? Should we ap
preciate the three daughters as well?
l>oes Lear or the rest learn anything from
him? Is he young or old?
11. How are natural phenomena em
ployed In this play?
II Is Cordelia's influence felt between
her departure for France and her return?
11 What do you think of Coleridgo'a
opinion that "Kent Is perhaps the nearest
to perfect goodness In all Shakespeare's
characters?
14/ Do the moral Issues Involved In this
tragedy come as near to men's hearts ami
bosoms as thoso Involved In the tragedy
of "Othello"? Do they affect as many
people.

Boston Wool Market.
BOSTON, Nov. 15.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow:
The wool market Is excited and advancing.
The dealers and \ the smaller manufacturers
are In competition with each other In their.
eagerness to secure wools and all grades are
feeling thÂ» Impetus of a buying movement,
which Is rapidly decreasing available stockK
here and elsewhere. A tremendous business
has been again transacted, the sales for the
last week aggregating over 16,000.000 pounds.
Large lines of fieeceÃ. washed and unwashed,
line and medium territory, Texas. California
and Oregon wools, a* well as foreign wools,
have been moved, in most Instances at top
figures.
Foreigners have made still further purchases
of our wools for export. The market Is so
excited that It Is not an easy matter to quote
prices, but the tendency Is upward in a most
marked manner. A wool famine la threatened
on account of the depleted stocks at home and
the reduced clip abroad.
The rul^s .if the Â»wk In Boston amounted to
â¢ nds domestic and 1.474.000 pounds
foreign, i.-mklng a total of U. 317.77* pounds.
agulnst a t.Â»tal of 15, 404. 000 i>ounds for the pre

A decline at Liverpool depressed the Chicago
market, which declined, but subsequently re
covered, closing firm. Broomhall cabled from
Liverpool that large holders were realizing.
Though the market was In buyers' favor there
was no realizing pressure to sell, but buyers
held off for lower prices on account of the bear
ish new* from the Argentine. The market
looked oversold and a reaction wu looked for.
Toward the end of the session the market was
unaccountably strong and there was evidently
heavy buying somewhere.

Hay and Feedstuff s.
As will be seen In the first column, the stock
of Hay on hand November 1 was over 157.1V0
tons, and dealer* say that from 25 to 33 1-3 per
cent will have to be added to thin amount to
get the real stocks. An the capacity of this
market Is less than 10.000 tons per month. It
will be seen that Including the consumption of
Oakland. San Jose and the other adjacent
towns thÂ»re will be a surplus next summer
when the new crop comes In of at least 75 000
tons. Hence th* outlook for the Hay farmer
for the next year or so Is gloomy, though some

point' of death, ana liÂ» nt iÂ«- oai>e, just
two weeks old, has been adopted by a
wealthy woman, v. im>- name is also kept

About three months ago the youns lady
appeared in Oakland, saying her borne
was neur Marlposa. She is not over 2S
years old. and it is said she had been a
school teacher. Soon after arriving in
Oakland she obtained employment In the
family of Mra. Dixby, on of the most
fashionable homes on upper Kruitvale
avenue. She was exceedingly well liked
by the family, who were favorably im
pressed by her refined manners.
The young lady was very secretive
about her parent! and the locality of her
home, hut made several acquaintances,
and Â«raj quite popular. A few lays cro,
while visiting a .Mrs. Hanjen, she was
suddenly taken 111, and before sho couH
be removed from the house she Â«.:v- birth
to a robust baby boy. Since then slw> has
been critically ill. and has told a story
that throws more li(?ht on her visit to
this city. She positively refuses to alve
any information that may lead to her
Identity and, fearing the worst, she has
consented to the adoption of her baby
boy The young mother undoubtedly
holds the key to a mlsslnp-dauphter mys

knife inflicted a fearful gash. It entered

BASKET-BALL
PLAYER LIKELY
TO LOSE AN EYE
He Was H.t by Oppo-

Oakland Oflice Han Francisco Call.
Ml Broadway. Nov. 15.
David Allen Clark, aged IT. of 2422 Ells
worth street, Berkeley, met with a slight
accident recently .i:* playing basket
ball at the Young Men's Christian Asso
ciation, on Twelfth and Clay streets, that
threatens to finally result most seriously
for him.
In a game between the association bas
ketball team and the Mission basketball
lean of San Francisco Mr. Clark was op
posing a throw when he was struck full
m the left eye by the elbow of a player
on the other aide. The accident, while
moat painful, was thought at the time to
not be at all serious. ThÂ« eye began to
â well rapidly, however, and after Mr
Clark had been taken home and medical
assistance summoned ii was found that
he was in danger of losing it This has
now become almost a certainty, for the
Injury has Increased in gravity, and it will
be three months before the attending phy
sician can state d( Inlteh the outcome of
the accident, so that the patient will be
long In suspense.
Mr. Clark's family are deeply grieved
over the unfortunate occurrence, since it
has come nt a time when he was progress

has been taking private Instruction at

State university In â  year or so. He ha-<

morning Â»J>e case was called on a motion
for a new trial. Attorney Whlttemore. on

affidavits relating to the character of the
fair prosecutrix. At the conclusion- of the
reading of this new evidence Judge Hall
asked Deputy District Attorney Harris if

now trial, and Harris replied that he
thought the defense had ample oppor

YANKEE GALLANTRY.
How a Troop if the Fourth Cavalry
Met an Ambuscade.
A copy of the Manila paper Freedom of
October 5. received here yesterday, gives
an Interesting account of how a small de
tachment of Troop a. Fourth Cavalry,
under command of Captain Cameron, got
out of a very bad hole. American valor
and the poor marksmanship of the Insur
gents conspired to save the little band
from what, under ordinary circumstances,
would have been short but wholesale
slaughter. ." â 
Captain Cameron and his men were out
on a reconnolterlng expedition in the vi
cinity of Santa Ana. Riding up the bed
of an arroyo they walked right Into a
carefully prepared trap. They found- them
selves surrounded by Insurgents, who
were secreted in three different intrench
mt-nts.
Private Radcllffo was shot in the head
and fell from his horse dead. For a mo
ment a panic seemed Inevitable. Captain
Cameron ordered his men to dismount.
The horses were sent for shelter around a
bend, and with twenty-five men Captain
Cameron advanced to within a few yards
of the hidden trenches, which were by
this time spitting lire and lead In a very
threatening manner. Waving his sword,
Cameron ordered a charge, and with a
yell which scared the insurgents the
American soldiers rushed on top of their
hidden foes, and within ten minutes from
the time of the first surprise had com
pletely routed the insurgents and taken
possession of their almost Impregnable
position. . :<â 'â 
During the, fight an Insurgent officer
fired four times point blank at Corporal
de Clairmont. The corporal not only
avoided the bullets, but assisted Private
LJnderfe.ldt In capturing the offlcer.
Corpora] de Clairmont is a San Francis-
Co boy, who entered the army as a private
last August with the Intention of earning
a commission. He comes naturally by his
flghtln* Instincts. He is a son of Colonel
Ralph de Clairmont of this city, who has
himself taken part in many a wild charge
and perilous siege.
