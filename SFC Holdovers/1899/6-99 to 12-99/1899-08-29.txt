CHICAGO, Aug. 28.â Twelve steel
arches, each weighing thirty-
three tons, which were * to have
supported the superstructure of
the Coliseum building, in course
of erection on Wabash avenue, between
Fifteenth and Sixteenth streets, fell to
the ground late this afternoon. It is
known that nine lives were crushed
out. .The bodies of two of the men are
under the wreckage. Ten are in th"
hospital with injuries received in the
accident and of these four will surely
die. One may possibly recover and the
balance are for the greater part seri
ously injured.
Those injured not seriously are:
Cornelius Toomey, J. H. Warley, John
Hawthorne, John J. Johnson, David
Reardon, H. P. Zimmer, J. Flack, J.
Hanson and Andrew Morrison.
All of the twelve arches were standing,
the twelfth and last having been com-
pleted to-day. It was the intention of the
steel contractors, the Pittsburg Bridge
Company of Pittsburg, Pa., to turn over
its work to-night to the general contract-
ors. The iron' "traveler," or derrick,
which had been used in the erection of the
arches had been removed, and the agents
of the bridge company were accounting
their work as practically completed when
suddenly and without the slightest pre-
liminary warning the arch last put in
jilace suddenly fell over against the one
next to it. The weight was too much for
this and it gave way, crashing against the
third, and, one by one. the great steel
spans fell over to the south, precisely in
the- same manner as a number of cards
would fall. Nearly all the men who were
killed wen at work on top of the arches.
forty feet above the ground. Some of them
made futile attempts to slide down the
sides of the arches, but before they could
help themselves they were hurled to the
ground. Many of them uttered piercing
shrieks for aid as they fell. Most of them
were killed outright by the awful nature
of their injuries. The ski.is of the unfor
tunate men were crushed Into shapeless
masses, their limbs were cut off as if by a
monster knife and they were mangled be-
yond recognition. The Immense structure
began falling slowly, each arch being sus
tained by the crossbeams supporting the
rent of the structure. As the mass gained
impetus the bars of Iron, Inches thick.
snapped with a loud report, and the great
mass moved faster and faster in its de-
scent to the ground. With a crash that
wat heard blocks distant the structure
fell, leaving the walls practically unin
jured, and sending up great clouds of
dust and dirt.
An immense crowd gathered around the
place and despite the efforts of the police.
who were close at hand, they swarmed
over the mass of wreckage, making dcs-
perate but ill-directed efforts to drag out
the dead and to save the wounded. It
was only with t.ie greatest difficulty that '
the police were finally able t.i drive back
the crowd and give the firemen and un-
injured workmen a chance to rescue the
injured. ,
That more men were not killed and in-
jured was almost a miracle. Fully fifty
men were at work in the space covered by
the arches as they fell. A number of the
men fell Into small excavations, of which
there are many in the ground beneath the
steel works, and although some were bat
tered up by the fall these, were saved from
the great masses of steel that crashed
down over them. Several of them were i

i standing under the arches when they com
! menced to fall, and, running to the side
walls, by great good fortune happened to
. stand in the space left vacant by the
curve of the arches away from the side
walls. Had the arches fallen to either
side the loss of life must have been much
; heavier, but they fell through to the south
on a parallel to the side of the building
j and none of them save the two southern
arches fell at all outside of the space to
be occupied by the building. The direct
cause of the accident is not known. One
theory which received some support is
that a shifting of the sand beneath th*
foundation caused the collapse of th"
first arch, which brought all the ethers
to the ground. A story which cannot be
substantiated is that a number of work-
men were using a pulley on the north arch
; while they were taking down some scaf-
folding that had been erected around it.
j They caused the arch to sway and finally
it swayed too far and fell out.
"I cannot say what caused the acci
i dent." said Superintendent Johnson. "I
could hardly believe my eyes when I saw
' the results of our weeks of work de-
stroyed in a minute."
The work of rebuilding will commence
! at once and it is expected that to-day's
accident will delay the opening of the
building not over one month. The financial
loss will not fall upon the Coliseum Com-
I pany, which is erecting the structure. Tne
only loser will be the Pittsburg Bridge
Company. The company's loss is esti
. mated at 125,000. The Coliseum will lose
indirectly financially through inability to
arrange for attractions .during the com
, ing winter season. The unfinished bund-
ing occupied the ground on the east side
of Wabash avenue, between Fourteenth
and Sixteenth streets, on which Libby
Prison formerly stood. The structure was
304 feet long by 172 feet wide and when
completed would have been 85 feet high.
i It was designed for the accommodation
of large conventions, expositions, circuses,
football games and other affairs of great
public attraction.
A singular fatality has attended all
buildings in Chicago called "coliseum."
The first to be erected stood on Sixty
, third street, and like the present Coliseum
it collapsed while being built in the fall of
1594. The side walls of the building had
been erected and eleven steel arches had
been put in place. It was desirable that
it should be speedily finished and th-
work was pushed night and day. It was
i the custom of the contractor to allow
his men time for lunch between 11:30 nnd
midnight. During this half hour, while
all the men were absent, all the arches
fell to the ground, injuring nobody, but
causing Â» pr<nÂ»erty loss of about $30,000.
The bui.JuiS was rebuilt <*;,.. the last
Democratic National Convention was held
within Its walls. The second Coliseum
was totally destroyed by fire on the night
of December 24, 1897, and was never re
' built. The accident to-day brought the
1 third Coliseum down, which will te re-
built at once. '

SAN JOSE, Aug. 2S.â Quick action
on the part of Brakernan Beachler
of the narrow-guage train averted
a horrible railway accident at
Santa Clara to-day. As it is, two
monster engines are piled one upon the
other in a ditch beside the track and
the baggage-car is wrecked.
The northbound Monterey Flyer.
nearly an hour behind time, which
leaves here at 9:12 for San Francisco,
was derailed at the crossing of the
broad and narrow gauge tracks at
Santa Clara this morning to prevent it
from crashing into the narrow-gauge
j passenger train bound for this city.
j Rules are strict in regard to stops be
; ing made at a crossing. The Flyer was
] drawn by a double-header and was at
j tempting to make up time. The nar
; row-gauge passenger had just left the
Santa Clara depot. Brakernan Beach
: ler went ahead to turn a switch and had
entered the semaphore house and made
! the switch. The signal was given to
I the narrow-gauge to come ahead.
Beachler looked up the track and saw
! the Flyer coming. He signaled to
Engineer James Stanley of the narrow
: gauge to stop and the engineer re-
versed his train and started back.
There was only one thing to do to
I prevent a collision and Beachler acted
; quickly. He opened the switch and de-
railed the Monterey train. Both en-
gines left the track, followed by the
| combination express and mail car and
the forward truck of the baggage-car.
Engine 1377 was ahead, in charge of
Engineer Fred Simpson and Fireman
Consell, and engine 1372 which followed
! was manned by Engineer Fred Stewart
and Fireman Judd. As soon as the en-
gineers saw the signal to stop they re-
versed their engines, but it was too late
to stop the heavy train. They set the
air-brakes and jumped, escaping with
only a* few scratches and a general
shaking up. The passengers were
nearly thrown from their seats by the
sudden jar, but none were injured.
Engine 1377 went in the ditch and
[ rolled over on its back and the one be-
I hind climbed right up on top of it.
There they lay locked in a death-like
embrace.
Brakernan Beachler as he left the
signal house was struck by flying tim-
bers and injured about the head. He
was picked up unconscious and brought
to this city. His injuries are not seri
ous. His first inquiry was "Did
I have my flag?" showing that he had
thought to save life by throwing the
switch. Trains were delayed for sev
eral hours, but the wreckers now have
the track clear.
Four years ago a bad wreck occurred
between passeneer trains at the same
crossing. At that time many persons
were seriously injured. Engineers
Stewart and Stanley who were on to-
day's trains were in that wreck, the
latter being nearly killed. Another co-
incidence is the fact that the numbers
of both wrecked engines began with
unlucky 13.

SPARKILL. N. V., Aug. 28.â
fire that broke out at 1 o'clock
this morning destroyed nine of
the ten buildings of the St. Agnes'
Convent and Orphanage, entailing
a loss of $150,000 and causing the death
of four persons. Besides the dead and
seriously injured, twenty-five inmates
were injured by falls, jumps and burns,
none seriously.
That more lives were not lost was
due to the heroism of the Sisters and
some of the older Inmates. When the
fire broke out the 400 inmates of the in-
stitution were asleep. Most of them
were got out in almost- perfect order,
but a score v^- c risked .hei- lives to
save others were finally forced to either
jump from the upper stories or make
desperate dashes through stairways
and corridors filled with flames and
smoke.
The fire was discovered in the lava-
tory and soon spread to the adjoining
buildings, attacking first a dormitory
in which 200 of the older boys slept.
Sister Reginald, who had trained the
lads in the fire drill, rushed down the
line of white beds and arousing the
sleepers, clapped her hands, the simple
fire signal followed in the orphanage.
The boys turned out with a rush and
gained the lawn in their night clothes.
By that time the second dormitory,
where the smaller boys slept, was
ablaze. The older lads made a dash for.
the building and were soon carrying
the smaller ones out. The buildings
were all finished with Georgia pine and
the wood burned furiously.
The convent and chapel made a great
stack of flame, and between them and
the second dormitory* the girls' dormi-
tory blazed and crackled as the fire
leaped up its wooden walls.
A dozen Sisters were cut off in the
upper stories of the convent building.
They were forced to the windows, and
while some climbed out to the sills,
others knelt at the casements in pray-
er. Engineer Otto placed a long ladder
on the outer wall and rescued half a
dozen. Six were forced to jump for
their lives and all but. Sister
Bertrand escaped without serious
Injury. The escape of Sister Agnes
seemed almost a miracle. She was cut
off on the fourth floor and elected to
jump from her window rather than
plunge into the furnace that had once
been a stairway. She climbed, out on
the sill and then, seizing the shutter.
swung out clear of the building. Then
she loosened her hold. She struck the
ground squarely upon her feet and
then fell over on her side. Before any
one could reach her she got up and
walked away unhurt.
The fire reached the girls' dormitory
last, but once it took hold of the build-
ing it burned fiercely. Most of the girls
were on the upper floors and it was
with the greatest difficulty that they
were got out. Shortly after the last
of the*' rescued left the second dormi-
tory there was a counting of heads and
the discovery was made that two baby
boys were missing. John Cody, a 15
- boy, made straight for the
door, paying no heed to the warnings
of danger. A moment later Cody came
dashing out of the building, under each
arm carrying one of the missing boys.
Firemen came from Piedmont and
Nyack, but the best they could do was
to save the hospital, a large two-story
building.
The Sisters and children were con-
veyed by teams to the Blauvelt Con
vent. As far as known but oue person
actually perished in the fire itself.
That was "Jane," an old pensioner,
aged 70 years, who was asleep in the
servants' quarter. Helen Brown and
Emma Mackin died from convulsions
that resulted from fright. Kate Mc-
Carthy was a servant in the convent
and had organic heart trouble. She
was badly frightened, collapsed in the
grounds and died later in the day.
It is believed Therese Murphy and
Mary Brown both escaped from the
fire, but that the former became de
mented and is leading .the other, girl
through the woods. . - â¢ J .-â¢
There were 326 children in the or-
phanage, sixty of -whom were girls and
their ages ranged from 2 to 16 years.

This city is the headquarters of the English army in the colony. It contains an arsenal, magazines and large bat
racks for all branches of the service. From a sketch made by J. Harrington several years ago.
CAPE TOWN, Aug. Replying to the. latest proposition of the British Secretary of State for the Colonies.
Mr. Chamberlain, the Government of the Transvaal has notified him that it adheres to its latest offer and will
not make any further concessions.
According to reports from Johannesburg, the burghers are everywhere exchanging Martinis for Mausers.
A heavy load of ammunition, Including 300 Mausers, arrived at Johannesburg on Friday from Utrecht, the
Netherlands.
The Cape House of Assembly is against discussing the question of transit of arms intended for Orange Free
State and presumably the Transvaal. Evidently a state of extreme tension exists as every speech made to-day
was received with almost absolute silence in the chamber.
William P. Schreiner, the Premier/personally appealed" to his followers to refrain from answering the criticism
of the opposition lest they should prove words, of ill feeling.
The entire opposition arose to support the motion for adjournment made by Right Hon. John Gordon Sprigg,
the former Premier. Sir John, who repeated the arguments he had. used in the previous debate, asked the Premier
what action the Cabinet proposed taking in the matter. He said that the recent speech of the British Secretary of
State for the Colonies. Sir Joseph Chamberlain, at Birmingham, England, had forced all to the conclusion that South
Africa was on; the brink of war unless the Transvaal met the -British demands. In his -opinion the Cape Govern
ment ought to', follow the example of Portugal at Delagoa Bay and refuse to permit the transit of arms as long as
the crisis lasted. - â¢ â¢*.".- v\ .- - -.- â 
After Sir John Gordon Sprigg had finished a pause occurred, the -house waiting for the Premier's . reply.
Finally Mr. â¢ Schreiner rose and declared, that under the customs convention the Orange Free State was justified
in importing arms through Cape Colony and he did not intend to tear up that. convention, knowing, as he did, that
there would be no war. ,*â  â¢.*â '' - â¢".'â¢. "_â  -,* â¢ . â 
"In the event of war," he said, "I would not lack .the .true Imperial spirit."
Mr. Schreiner then read a letter from President .Steyn of the Orange Free- State, denying any intention on the
part of that Government to take up arms. in any aggressive or offensive manner against the ' British Government
or the Cape Colony. It was the final policy of the Orange. Free State, President Steyn continued, never to take up
arms except when attacked or in support of its-treaty-obligations. The letter created a profound impression as
clearly showing the purpose of the* importation of- firearms. Several members dwelt upon this phase, and Mr.
Schreiner promises in the case of future consignments to consult the Governor; of Cape Colony. Sir Alfred Milner,
which he admitted he had not previously done. He also asserted that the Cape Colony would maintain neutrality
in the event of war. . .- â "'. ' â¢! ' *â¢
LONDON, Aug. 28.â The St. James Gazette to-day says' that' .it 'learns that an inspection iby General Joubert,
commander in chief of the Transvaal force, disclosed the fact that nine-tenths of the reserve Shells and cartridges
in the Pretoria forts are inefficient and that an immediate order to renew the supply was placed in Europe.
The Cape Town correspondent of the Daily Chronicle says: British troops will be immediately concentrated
at Laings Neck and Mafaking, and it is believed that the British programme will be to surround the Transvaal and
then to negotiate a. new. convention. ... ..'.,:
Although not definitely known, it is assumed here in London that Mr. Chamberlain 'had the reply of the
Transvaal Government ,before he delivered the Birmingham speech. It is also believed that on the receipt of Presi
dent Kruger's offer of a five years* franchise and other concessions, Mr. Chamberlain wired that they were unac
ceptable â¢ and suggested modification. If this be so, and if the reply to that suggestionâ that the Transvaal Govern
ment adheres to its latest offer and will make no further concessionsâ be President Kruger's final answer the posi
tion is ominous. ...
The importance of President Steyn's letter to Mr. Schreiner lies in the fact that an offensive treaty exists be
tween'the Transvaal and the Orange Free State. .

authenticity of the report is questioned.
advices from . the Herald's correspond-
ent. at San Domingo, which have been
delayed in transmission, state that on
Friday the revolutionists were only a
few hours' distant from the capital and
that the Government was tottering.
Senor Grullon, the recipient of the
cablegram, said:
- "There is no question in my mind as
to the truth of this cablegram. Mr.
Osmun Le Marche is an agent of the
Dominican revolutionists and would
not for the world think of sending any
such message if it were not true. There
has been to my mind no fighting. The
whole people have arisen and over-
turned the Government. It was a
peaceful revolution. The people have
no faith in the present Government of-
ficials, who were the servants of the
late President Hereaux, and combine
all his bad qualities without having his
ability.
â _ Senor Grullon said: "So far as my
plan has been considered, it is safe to
say that for the present some provi

until the general election is held. I
know certainly that General Jiminez
will not assume any offlce until he is
'chosen at an election by the people.
He wants to be the popular choice. He
does not want jto ride into offlce by
force or by any sudden coup. He vill
wait for the election and he will be tri
umphantly elected. The people want
him. GeneraL Jiminez is not a profes
sional revolutionist. He is known in
New York and. has been engaged m
professional enterprises since 1875. He
is a man of high ideate and wants to
give to' the San Domingo Government

JEROME, Ariz., Aug. 28.â Jerome was;

by a band of Apaches in war paint pass
ing through the town. Leaders of the

rades. Additional interest was lent to the '
occurrence by the presence r of- only

A reporter of the Associated Press se- j
cured a horse anc overtook tne. Indians a
few miles from Jerome, and after consid
erable persuasion was permitted to ac
company them on the journey of twenty
miles over the roughest imaginable coun
try. When the vicinity of Red Rock was
approached the pace of the horses wa.-
quickened' and an impatience was noticed

a canyon with perpendicular walls rising
to a height of hundreds ~i feet were the
lemains of a campiire and near by a wig- I
warn. In front of the wigwam was the
body of a squaw and papoose, while a *
few rods in front was a buck. All three j
hail been horribly .mutilated and scalped.
The hands and feet were rut off.
The Indians formed a circle and on the I
dismembered bodies swore to wreak yen- j
beance. The name Zuni occurred many'
times. The bodies were burled near the
scene of the crime and the band took the
trail to the north. 1ie.,.! Justin, one of
th.- most intelligent of the band, and who
speaks excellent English, was delegated
to accompany the reporter to the bounds
of civilization, and of him something of
the affair was learned.
The. Zunis are a New Mexico tribe, while
the Apaches are of Arizona. A bitter en
mity has existed for years between the
tribes, but a truce has put an end to hos- i
tilities for some time.
The three murdered Indians had left
their reservation near Camp Verde and
were surprised by a band of Zunis. The
Apaches took their trail In the direction i
r.f New Mexico, and old settlers fear that j
a furious outbreak will follow and end In
the extermination of one of the tribes.
There are no soldiers within reach, and
settlers are not disposed to interfere in

SEARCHING FOR
THE DERELICT

Unsuccessful Voyage of
the Willapa.
â â¦ â
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. 1., Aug. 28.â The mys
tery of the derelict barkentine which is
reported to have played tag with the reefs
off CtayotJUOt three weeks ago Is still un
solved. Indeed It grows more mysterious.
The steamer Willapa, which went as far
as the north end of Vancouver Island to
search for her, ha- returned, and neither
saw nor heard anything further of the
wandering barkentine. But although she
saw nothing of the vessel, the Willapa
saw campnres along the beachâ fires
which looked as though they were the
temporary homes of a shipwrecked crew.
They were over forty miles from any hab
itation and on a seldom visited part of the
coast. To see if there was any sign of
lift-, the steamer bore well inshore and
the officers scanned the beach with their
glasses, but without avail. If any ship
wrecked mariners had been there they
were not then visible, and It was too
rough for a landing to be made to In
vestigate further.
Another story which is coupled with the
mystery is that told by Captain A. L.
Hammen of the schooner Lily L, which
has returned from Unalaska. He tells of
sighting a derelictâ it maybe the same one
seen off Clayoquot â on August 16, in lati
tude 49 degrees and 58 minutes north,
longitude 136 degrees and 'd minutes west.
about 350- miles from the north end of
Vancouver Island. She was a three-mast
ed barkentine, square rigged. The lower
part of the mainmast was- standing, on
which was a gaff!- The hull was badly
broken and a great deal of the planking
gone, showing the vessel's ribs. She
seemed to be loaded with lumber. Another
search wil be made for the wandering
vessel. *

McLEAN IS NOW
ON THE SCENE
â â¢
Ohio Democratic Clans
at Zanesville.
â â
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ZANESVILLE. Ohio. Aug. 28.-The
Democratic State Convention was Inaug
urated to-day by the arrival of John R.
McLean this afternoon and Colonel
James R. Kilbourne to-night and all the
other candidates for Governor and other
places on the State ticket. While the at
tendance is unusually large there are not
many delegates present. They will come
to-morrow with the visiting clubs. The
preliminary meetings do not occur until
4 p. m. to-morrow and the convention does
not convene till Wednesday. There are
probably no changes to-day in the fig
ures. The arrival of McLean has made
his friends more enthusiastic and the ar
rival of Kilbourne has made some of his
friends more desperate. The other can
didates for Governor are not doing much
except shaking hands, with the excep
tion of Sherwood, who seems to be in
line for second place. The McLean men
are so confident of not less than seventy
six more than is necessary on the first
ballot that they are figuring on their
running mates. They prefer Colonel
James Kilbourne for Lieutenant Gov
ernor, but so far neither he nor his
friends will concede fhe nomination to
McLean or accept the second place. If
the Kilbourne men hold out it is likely
that the ticket will be McLean and Sher
wood.
The McLean leaders held a general con
ference late this afternoon and gave re
assurances afterward of a majority of
seventy-eight over all, together with
claims of seventeen sure and probably
eighteen of the twenty-one Congressional
districts. This would Insure them the
control of all the committees to-morrow
night and absolute control of the conven
tion.
Judge William T. Mooney will be tem
porary chairman of the convention, but
he is not wanted by the McLean men for
permanent chairman. Congressman J. D.
Norton will be the permanent presiding
officer.
The candidacy of McLean has brought
many prominent men here that have not
attended conventions for many years.
Some of them are from other States.
Nearly all the "old guard" that was in
McLean's organization in 1897. when he
sought to succeed Sherman as Senator,
are here and all of the workers he mar
shaled two years ago against Hanna are
here. Kilbourne has not only the old
friends of Thurman. but quite an army
of new men of his own following. All
of the candidates seem to have "root
ers" available.
The indications to-day are that there
will be opposition to the adoption of the
proposed constitution that provides a
more definite plan of party organization
and a uniform system for selecting dele
gates to all Democratic conventions.

RULINGS AS TO
RAILWAY RATES
Decision of Commerce
Commission.
â â
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 2S.â The Inter-
state Commerce Commission to-day an-
nounced its decision in a case involving
the relative rates on export and domestic
traffic in grain and grain products.
The commission holds that in the ab
sence of some justifying reason it would
not be right for American railroads to
permanently transact business for for- '
eigners at a less rate than that for which
they render corresponding service to j
American citizens. As to rates on ex- 1
port and domestic shipments of grain the !
commission decides:
Market conditions sometimes, in case of
wheat but seldom in case of corn, may- ;
justify an export rate through the port '
of New York somewhat lower than the
domestic rate, and Philadelphia, Balti-
more. Norfolk and Newport News usually I
take rates which arc certainly differen
tials below the ' New York rate on both
I domestic and export traffic. During the
J period of closed lake navigation the ex-
port and domestic grain rates to New
York and the other ports mentioned
j should ordinarily be the same. Rates to
j other ports. including Boston and ports
! on the Atlantic north of Boston, and Gal- |
veston. New Orleans and other gulf ports,
i may perhaps be properly made lower on
export than on domestic traffic, to en
; aid.- them to compete for the export busi-
ness. Such an adjustment of the rates
| would be to the advantage of the carrier,
I and just alike to the American consumer
; and the American producer. But as the
problem is primarily one for the carriers
I rather than this commission, no order is
| made in relation to this branch of the
i case. But the export grain rates should
I not be less to the seaboard from any point
j than from an intermediate point of the
j same line.
As to the rates on export flour as com
: pared with export wheat, the commission
i holds that public policy and good railway
1 policy alike seem to require the same rate
| on export wheat and export flour, but in
I view of the conditions shown in the inves
tigation a somewhat higher rate on .ex
; port flour than on export wheat is not in
j violation of that statute. The published
I difference in rates is too wide, and the
rate on flour for export should not exceed
that upon export wheat by more than 2
cents per 100 pounds. The relation of rates
on domestic shipments of flour ahd wheat >
: is not Involved In this decision, as the ex-
port and domestic freights are handled
under different conditions.
It further appeared that carriers en- i
gaged In the transportation of export flour
from Minneapolis at a rate which was 1^
; cents -less than the domestic rate to the .
; port of export refuse to make any corre
sponding concession to intermediate mil
: lers. The commission says that this is |
I unjust and unlawful discrimination
: against such intermediate traffic, and that
whatever line participates in such lower ,
; export rate on flour from Minneapolis j
, must .make a corresponding rate upon
* similar traffic from intermediate points.
The commission also decides that rates '
on export traffic must be published and
filed in accordance with the provisions of
section 6 of the interstate commerce act. i
It is further held that so-called through !
! export rates, made by adding the ocean I
rate, whatever It may be, to the Inland
I rail rate, whatever it may lie. are not â 
; analogous .to rates made by joint arrange- I
ments between railroad carriers subject
I to the statute in the sense that the total
j rate must be published and filed, and it
i is enough If the railway carrier publishes
! and maintains its own rate- to the sea- j
i board. But if there is, in fact, such a
| joint arrangement that the rate is a joint ,
| rate under the sixth section of the act to i
regulate commerce, then ,- the entire !
I through rate should be published, and not i
! the Inland division, which in that. case
i might vary while the entire rate remains *
the same. - . . . s

RENNES, Aug. 28.â balance
of the evidence to-day, for a
change, was in favor of Dreyfus.
Five witnesses were for him and
two against him.
The most interesting testimony was
that of Chief Handwriting Expert
Charavay, who had come to declare that
he had changed entirely his opinion,
which in 1894 was against, and is now
in favor of Dreyfus, who he to-day af
firmed .was not the author of the bor
dereau. His candid confession of error
was received with murmurs of satis
faction in court, which became discreet
applause in spite of Colonel Jouaust's
patent disapproval, when he solemnly
added:
"I declare here, on my soul and con
science, that the bordereau was writ
ten by Esterhazy."
The most important incident, how
ever, was Colonel Jouaust's acquies
cence to Major Carrlere's request that
a rogatory commission be Instructed to
take Colonel dv Paty de Clam's depo
sition. The initiative came purely from
the Government Commissary, Maitres
Labori and Demange having no faith
ln such a measure, because it allows Dv
Paty de Clam to escape cross-examina
tion, which is the only thing worth
having under the present circum
stances. Dv Paty de Clam being a wit
ness for the prosecution, Major Car
riere will simply prepare a list of ques
itons which an examining magistrate
will put to Dv Paty de Clam at his resi- |
dence and nobody supposes that the
witness will be very much embarrassed
by the interrogatories.
To-day the central figure in the
courtyard, which is the meeting place j
for all the leading personages of the j
trial during the suspension of the ses- j
sions, was Captain Freystmetter, who i
was the subject" of many flattering re
marks on his manly and soldier-like
bearing. Indeed, the interest in him j
was so great that some persons waited j
all night long outside the door of the;
court in order to obtain standing room |
in the rear part of the courtroom, in \
the hope of seeing him at to-day's sit- |
ting, an impression having gone abroad
that he might be recalled. His modest
and frank manner inspired admiration
in all except the generals and the other
military witnesses for the prosecution. i
who seemed afraid of him and scowled ;
in his direction from the other side of !
the courtyard. Captain Freystmetter I
will not remain here until the end of
the trial, but will leave Rennes in a few- j
days. \.r
M. de Freyclnet, formerly Minister of j
War. arrived this afternoon and will |
testify to-morrow.
FIELD DAY FOR EXPERTS
ON HANDWRITING
Bertillon's Testimony Punctured by
Witnesses Cabled by the
Defense.
RENNES. Aug. 28.â When the fourth
week of the second trial by court-martial
of Captain Alfred Dreyfus of the artil
lery, charged with treason, opened in
the Lycee building this morning General
Mercier, who was Minister of War when
Dreyfus was first tried. In 1894, was pres
ent ib usual In the front row of the wit
ness' seats, thus definitely setting at rest
the reports that he had fled to the Isl
and of Jersey and as to his arrest.
The first witness to-day was M. Paray-
Javal. the draughtsman, whose evidence
was Interrupted on Saturday by the ad
journment of the court. M. Paray-Javal
was called by the defense to refute the
system by which M. Bertillon, chief of
the anthropometric department of the
Paris Prefecture of Police, last week at
tempted to prove that the prisoner wrote
the famous bordereau in a disguised
hand and by means of the key-word
"interest," and that it could not have
been written by Esterhazy. although the
flocument was in a handwriting resemb
ling that of Esterhazy. With the aid of
a blackboard M. Paray-Javal demonstrat
ed the fallacy of M. Bertillon's calcula
tions and criticized the latter's unfairness
ln not subjecting Esterhazy's handwrit
ing to the same tests as the prisoner's
writing. At the same time tne draughts
man declared that even if M. Bertillon
had done so the results would not have
pfoved anything. â '*-
In brief, the morning session may be
said to have been a field day for the
handwriting experts, who devoted them
selves to demolishing one another's evi
dence. The public followed the deposi
tions listlessly, but the judges and coun
sel listened with the greatest attention.
General Mercier did not seem to be very
cheerful to-day. He hardly said a word
to General Gonse during the whole morn
ing, but during the brief suspension of
the court's sitting he and Generals Gonse
and Reset walked ip and down the court
yard of thp Lycee engaged In conversa
tion Genera] de Roisdeffre-was not pres

After two witnesses had testified and
argued against M. Bertill system it
was the opinion of the sympathizers' of
Dreyfus that if the statements of the
witnesses were '7.*" they had simply
pulverized M. Bertillon. The latter
wished to reply, but the court, Colonel
Jouaust, declined to allow the specialist
to go over his evidence again, taking the
ground that the evidence would never
end If every expert did the same.
An amusing scene followed. M. Bertil
lon pleaded that he had a personal state

Every morning Captain Dreyfus leaves the military prison for the Lycee, where the trial is held, at a quarter past

Lycee has to pass through a double row of soldiers, who are drawn up. as shown in the sketch, with their backs turned

ment to make and mounted the platform. I
But he had hardly uttered a half-dozen
words when Colonel Jouaust saw he was
merely regrlnding his evidence, and to
the great satisfaction of the audience
curtly told the specialist to leave the
platform, which he did discomfited.
M. Trissonieres' testimony against Drey
fus followed. Then M. Charavay, tlK> ex
pert who had previously* declared Drey
fus was the author of the bordereau, was
called to the witness bar. His testimony
proved to be of the great) interest, as
he came to confess he had made an error
and he was now- convinced that Ester- c
hazy and not Dreyfus wrote the borde- I
reau. This announcement made a deep |
impression on the court, and was greeted i
with a general murmur of satisfaction.
The next witness, M. Pellier. also testi
fied favorably to the prisoner.
M. Cordier, another expert, deposed that
' as a result of his examination lie had
become convinced that the bordereau was
not written by Esterhazy, but he could
not say it was written by Dreyfus, be
j cause he had not seen the prisoner's writ-
I ing. This witness kept the court In a
i continual roar of laughter by the extra
i ordinary modulations of his voice, mis
placed emphasis and gestures.
The final witness. M. Varinaud, main
tained the declaration he had made be
fore the Court of Cassation, that the
bordereau was not written by Esterhazy.
Colonel Jouast then announced that M.
de Frevclnet. who resigned the Ministry
of War on May 6 of this year, and who i
was succeeded by M. Krantz. who in turn
was succeeded by General le Marquis de
GallJfet on the downfall of the Dupuy
ministry, would be among the witnesses
to-morrow, and the session was closed
with the request that a rogatory commis
sion be sent to Colonel Dv Paty de ("lam.
whose illness prevents his attendance in
court, In which Colonel Jouast agreed.
! This step does not satisfy the defense,
I but they acquiesced to the commission
taking Dv Paty de Clanfs testimony on
the principle that half a loaf Is better
than no bread.
I The following is the more Important tes
timony In detail:
M. Paray-Javal, draughtsman, resumed
his testimony at the opening of the court j
this morning, and with the assistance of |
a blackboard, proceeded to show the fal- j
lacy of calculations of M. Bertillon and j
the latter's unfairness in not submitting |
the handwriting of Esterhazy to the same
tests as the prisoner's. He declared, how
ever, that even if M. Bertillon had^lone
1 so the results would not have proved any
-1 thing. The witness, however, insisted
that M. Bertillon had shown a vicious
j method in only making a partial experi
ment, -zx.
Continuing. M. Paray-Javal proceeded '
. to show that the geometric regularities
alleged by M. Bertillon did not in reality
exist. He pointed out a number of irreg
ularities in the handwriting of the border-
I eau and said the same irregularities were
particularly noticeable in Esterhazy's cal-
I ligraphy. He contended that the alleged
â  irregularity of the key word "interest"
was only approximate and proceeded to
illustrate his arguments on the black
board, showing that all M. Bertillon's
proofs applied as equally to Esterhazy as
Dreyfus. Finally. M. Paray-Javal de
clared that M. Bertillon's measurement
of the word "Interest," which served as
the basis for the whole system, was en-
tirelv false and therefore M. Bertillon's
entire system "falls to the ground and
no longer exists." (Great sensation.) This
witness, who had awakened the interest
of his hearers, maintained that the bor
| dereau could not have been traced, add- '
I ing that it was an utter Impossibility. He
then proceeded to Illustrate why this was
the case and to prove the falseness of M.
Bertillon's deductions.
In conclusion M. Paray-Javal said that
he thought that M. Bertillon was a very
intelligent man. but that his system was
false and he. the witness, was convinced
that only self-esteem prevented M. Ber-
tillon admitting his error.
M. Bernard, an Inspector of mines, who
took high honor at the polytechnic school.
who followed M. Paray-Javal at the wit
ness bar. said be appeared to refute a por
tion of M. Bertillon's evidence, which was
based on false calculations. As a matter
of fact, he added. it was on such a basis
that the whole system rested. "Witness
said he was greatly surprised that M. Ber-
tillon thought fit to have recourse to psy
chological arguments to prove:
First, that the bordereau was fabri
cated. -â¢ "
Second, that the methods which might
have been employed in writing certain
words were such as to constitute proof
against Dreyfus. ,".=-.i ._,_. .:- ;.,
M. Bernard also said he was astonished
at the fact that M. Bertillon had under
taken to account for the shape of letters
and the space between words. There was
not 1.25 millimetre as alleged by M. Ber
tillon. but 1.56. Moreover, the writing of
the bordereau was natural and rhythmic,
which its character and size showed It
was not written by either a short-sighted
or a long-sighted person. The witness
then proceeded to Illustrate photographic
ally his contention that the bordereau was
not a fabricated document and also
pointed out important differences between
M Bertillon's photographs and the orig
inal.
M. Trissonieres followed. He said he ad-
hered in all respects to his report dated
October 29. 1594, in which he expressed the
opinion that the bordereau was the work
of the writer of the documents seized at
the prisoner's residence. For the purpose
of comparison the witness lengthily criti
cized the bordereau letter by letter, point
ing out resemblances ln the prisoner's
handwriting.
In conclusion M. Trissonieres said he
thought It was impossible to find more
tangible reasons than those which in
duced in him the belief, which he hoped
the court would share. (Sensation.)
Replying to the court/ M. Trissonieres
said lie had not notion the prisoner's
handwriting was Illegible, and he had
never seen the document dictated to Drey-
fus The copy of the bordereau made by
Dreyfus was then handed to the witness,
who declared it had never been given to
him for purposes of comparison. (Sensa
tion.) The witness added that he would
require three days to give an opinion upon -
THE SAN- FRANCISCO CALL. TUESDAY, : AUGUST 29, 1899.
SENATE TO PROBE
THE CONSPIRACY
PARIS, Aug. According to
the Matin therecent discoveries
of documentary evidence of a
plot against the security of the
state has caused ' the Govern
ment to decide upon calling the
Senate together as a high court
of justice. Documents in the
hands of M. Fabre, the examin
ing magistrate, leave no possible
doubt In regard to the existence
of a plot.
A fortnight will be allowed the
Senators to return, so it is un
likely the court will be called
before the second half of Sep
tember.
: It. He could not conclude his examina
tion on the spot. He must have time.
1 Here a member of the court-martial, |
giving the result of his examination of the j
I bordereau, remarked: "The letter "1" is ;
always isolated, even at the beginning of
I words."
To this M. Trissonieres replied that this
peculiarity was also found in the prison-
er's handwriting.
When he was invited to reply* to the wit-
ness Dreyfus said that M. Trissonieres' j
remarks seemed to him "quite incorrect," !
and that in order to reply properly, he,
the prisoner, must have the documents
under his eyes.
"As regards the criticism on the subject ;
j of paragraphing," Dreyfus added, "1 beg
| to reply that one does not make a fresh ,
j paragraph except when beginning a new j
I idea. Every time 1 begin a new idea in
anything 1 write I make a paragraph."
The prisoner, in conclusion, asked the
president of the court to request the wit- |
ness before he retired to produce the doc-
uments furnished to him for comparison,
of which the defense had no knowledge.
Colonel Jouaustâ Certainly.
After a brief suspension of the session
the court resumed hearing testimony, and .
M. Charavay, the archivist and reporter
on ancient manuscripts, was called to the i
witness bar. . His deposition was so maud- '
ible that he was requested to speak up.
"In 1894," said M. Charavay, "I, with
two colleagues, though acting under sepa-
rate instructions, was commissioned to
examine the bordereau and a number of
documents for comparison, unsigned and
In different handwriting. 1 examined first :
the latter documents, and by the process
of elimination fixed upon one resembling
the bordereau. I was then furnished with '
specimens of the handwriting in question,
but was not told the name of the writer.
1 asked if the document could be regarded ,
as genuine, and was told the place whence
it emanated, which could Dot be mentioned !
by me and which could leave no doubt in
regard to Its value. I make this remark ;
; because I think it explains my opinion, |
for I could not consider that a document
of this nature which was not marked by
a certain dissimilitude of handwriting. I :
therefore attributed to the dissimulation
the differences I was careful to note in
, my report. I must inform the court that
in view of the fact that handwriting which
was not produced in 1594, and which is cvi- |
dently akin to the handwriting of the bor
; dereau, .as the handwriting of Dreyfus,
has since been submitted to me, I cannot i
maintain with the same degree of certain-
ty the 'conclusions of my former report,
and I can only make one statement, name-
ly, that those two handwritings resemble
the bordereau. ;:'.;â¢*
"I should, however, point out one of the
typical dissimilarities upon which 1 laid
stress in the writing of the bordereau and
the documents submitted for comparison,
j namely, that the double 's' is not found
I between the bordereau and the new hand-
I writing. In other words, the double V in
the bordereau is found in Esterhazy's
j writing. . ,T. ..
After repeating the evidence he gave
â  the Court of Cassation M. Charavay de-
clared It was the new element, the' hand
i writing of Esterhazy, which led him to
declare he did not adhere to the conclu
sions in 1894. ' ..V: 'â¢.*:â¢-..:.
In conclusion M. Charavay energetically
! protested against General Mercier'a ac-
cusations, adding that what convinced
! him that he had made a mistake in 1594
was the publication of Esterhazy's letters.
I the discovery of the Henry forgery, the
i inquiry of the Court of Cassation and Es
i terhazy's confession. The conscience of
the witness compelled him to say that in
1894 he was misled by similarity in hand
! writing.
"It is a great relief to my conscience,"
M. Charavay added, "to be able to say
j before you and before him who Is the vie
. Tim of my mistake that the bordereau is
not the work of Dreyfus but of Ester-
hazy."
M. Pelletier, another expert, prefaced
! his evidence by saying that he desired to
i make a definite statement on the point
I on which he was in entire disagreement
. with General Mercier. The latter had tes-
I tified that the witness refused to use cer- j
tain documents submitted to him for com-
parison, in common with the other ex-
perts, and said* he had been led to regard
M. PeUetier's work with some suspicion
because of certain incidents in which M.
Pelletier. being summoned to appear sim-
ultaneously in two different courts, had
written to both excusing himself on the
j ground of attendance at the other.
General Mercier declared this made him
I suspicious of M. PeUetier's report in favor
of Dreyfus, inferring that his failure to
I comply with the summons of the examin- â 
lng magistrates In November, 1594, was !
connected with his report, whereas his |
report, the witness pointed out, was ;
handed in on October 26.
"I have only to oppose facts to General .
Mercier's inferences," said M. Pelletier.
"On October 22 I was Intrusted with the
verification in question. I handed In my *
report October 26, and It was only in No-.
vember that 1 was summoned to undergo
cross-examination on a complaint lodged
by the military authorities. General Mer- I
cier. In short, had not the slightest reason
to suspect the conclusions which I had !
reached."
After replying to a question or two from
the court M. p. 11. tier continued: "After
settling this persona] matter there re
mains nothing but to maintain in their
entirety my conclusions to the effect that
there is no likeness between the writing
of the bordereau and that of the pris
oner."
Continuing, the witness said that after
a fresh superficial examination of the
Esterhazy and Dreyfus writings he ex
pressed the belief that the bordereau
could only be ascribed to Esterhazy.
M. Couard. the official expert in the Es
terhazy case in 1897, then testified that
he was Instructed by Major Ravary to
expertly examine the bordereau and speci
mens of Esterhazy's handwriting. The
witness Insisted upon experimenting with i
the original bordereau and specimens of !
Esterhazy's caligraphy. written by Ester
hazy In the presence of experts. Beyond
this the experts and Esterhazy had no
relations. The latter, therefore could not
have Influenced him and the witness pro
tested against M. Zola's accusation and
adhered to his opinion of 1897 that thÂ©
bordereau was not the work of Esterhazy.
He (the witness) would wager his head
on this. (Daughter.)
The Government commissary. Major
Carriere arose and said: "I have handed
the court a letter regarding the health of
Colonel Dv Paty de Clam. It Indicates
that Dv Paty de Clam is writing his evi
dence and that he will send It to us.
That deposition has not arrived. I there
fore ask the president of the court to be
kind enough to instruct the reporter of
the second Paris court-martial to have
the evidence of Dv Paty de Clam taken
by a court commission."
The president of the court assented to
this and at 11:50 o'clock the court ad
journed for the day;

DUKE OF ORLEANS
LEAGUED WITH GUERIN
Such Is the Belief Said to Be Held by
the Police Authorities of
Paris.
NEW YORK. Aug. 28. -A Sun cable from
Paris says: The Courrler dv Soir says it
has learned of the importance which the
Government attaches to th? siege of the
house in the Rue de Chabrol in which the
anti-Semite leader, Guerin, and a number
of his friends have intrenched themselves
against the authorities. If true, it ex
plains the reason why the place was not
attacked days ago by the military.
The paper declares that the Government
believes that one of the pretenders to the
French throne, presumably the Duke of
Orleans, is in the house with Guerin, and
It wishes to capture him alive, in view of
the proof that his presence would furnish
of the monarchist conspiracy. If an as
sault should be made on the place It might
happen that the pretender would be killed.
and this the Government wishes to avoid.
Court's Sitting Resumed.
RENNES. Aug. 29.â When the Dreyfus
court-martial resumed its session this
morning Mercier and the other generals
were present as usual. Colonel Cordler,
who was deputy chief of the Intelligence
Bureau under Colonel Henry, testified to
the effect that Colonel Sandherr and not
Colonel Henry received the bordereau.

SANTA ANA, Aug. 28.â Thomas J.
Cook, a Peatlands farmer, recently ac
quitted of the murder of Jasper Grlggs
by of the same place, was shot" and
killed by his wife Katie this morning.
Jealousy was the cause and trouble
had been brewing for some time. Cook
was one of the best-known men In the
county and had the reputation of being
a gun fighter and a reckless man. He
had resided in this county eighteen
years, and in that time had engaged in
a deadly fight with his brother, each
emptying his gun with intent to kill.
without harm resulting. For some
time he and his wife had been on ill
terms because of alleged Infidelity on
his part. 'â  : .-
Cook was found this morning by
alarmed neighbors lying on a mattress
in his wife's room, with a bullet hole in
the corner of his right eye, stone dead.
The wife says Cook went out last night
[ and did not come home until 3 o'clock
jin the morning. When he returned she
I upbraided > him for infidelity and was
| told to do the next best thing if sh-
I didn't like it. Cook threatened to do her
j bodily harm if she exposed him. They
; quarreled, and at length Cook fell
j asleep and his wife took a gun from
j beneath his pillow and shot him. The
| shot alarmed the hired man, who
aroused the neighbors.
The girl in the case is Mabel Moody,
apparently about IS years old, and the
daughter of a rancher living some two
I or three miles southeast of the Cook
j home. She flatly contradicts Mrs. Cook
] and also says that Mr. and Mrs. Cook
I quarreled almost incessantly, and that
; Cook accused his wife of being too inti
j mate with the hired man? /.:/"â¢",'.
Much interest is manifested over the
shocking tragedy as Cook, although a
. turbulent, reckless man, had many
-. friends who stood by him through the
', trial in which he was acquitted of the
| murder of Jasper Griggsbv, and who
: still stoutly aver his innocence of any
; thing more serious than justifiable
j homicide in that matter.
Mrs. Cook also has many friends in
! the neighborhood, where she is well
known a.-*- the daughter of J. H. Pope, a
prominent farmer of that section. She
Is Cook' second wife and is but 28 years
old and had been married to Cook for
nine years. Cook has one brother in
Tulare County and has no other known
relatives in this country. Mrs. Cook
was brought to this city is now at the
County Jail. The witnesses to be called
jat the inquest to-morrow , are James
: Barton, Mabel ; Moody. SG. Vf. . Moore
and W. M. mann. The preliminary
j trial is set for August 30. Prominent
I counsel has been retained to represent
: the prisoner. The defense will be emo
\ tional insanity and the feeling to-night
j is strongly in the woman's favor.
CHINAS EMPEROR FEARS
HE MAY BE POISONED
Declares That Treacherous Ministers
Who Hate Him May Attempt
to Destroy Him.
TACOMA, Aug. Oriental advices per
! steamer Tacoma state: The Emperor of
| China, Hwang Hsu, is now provided with
j three meals a day. at each of which he
! is only given two kinds of vegetables and
j a small bowl of rice. It Is even suspected
! that an attempt is being made to starve
| and make his Majesty even weaker than
he has been. To a confidential eunuch
his Majesty recently said:
"My restoration to power is only a
question of time, hence I am only "too
anxious to maintain my health and bide
my time. I am only afraid that the one
or two traitorous Ministers who hate me
may by their machinations succeed ln
destroying me, and I have no means of
counteracting their treachery."
A report has just come of a serious riot
In Chinese Thibet at a place called Paao
An, some 130 miles over the border from
! Kansu. The Christian and Missionary
! Alliance has had a station there for about
, two years or so. and this has been at
tacked and looted by the Thibetans. The
missionaries, the Rev. George T. Shields
i and wife; with Mrs. McÃeth, barely es
caped with their lives to Lancheo. where
the China inland mission has workers.
This party of missionaries left Central
j China in the fall of last year and had
* consequently not been at Paao An for
more than a few months. The natives
had shown themselves . rather trouble
some, and to make matters worse the
Chinese officials, on being appealed to re

action.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
HULL, England. Aug. Walter Well-
man, the leader of tUe Wellman Polar ex- |
pedition, who returned to Tromsoe, Nor- ;
way. August 17, after having successfully j
completed operations in Franz Josef Land, '
has arrived here. IJe walks with the aid
j of crutches, his right leg. which was se-
! riously Injured by a fall into a snow-coy-
| ered crevasse while Mr. Wellman was
, leading his party, still being useless. The i
i explorer was accompanied by the Ameri- i
! can members of the expedition, who are
i well. In an Interview Mr. Wellman said:
"The object of the expedition* was two-
i foldâ to. complete the exploration of Franz
Josef Land, of which the north and
northeast parts were practically unknown,
and to reach a high latitude, or even the
pole itself. The hrst object was success-
fully accomplished. The second would
have been achieved, at least to a greater
extent than by previous explorers, but
for the accident to myself."
Mr. Wellman recounted the starting of
the expedition from Tromsoe June 26,
1898, how it reached Elmwood, the head-
quarters of the Jackson expedition, July
?S, and hoisted there the stars and stripes
i underneath the Union Jack, which had'
I been flying over the deserted settlement
] for nearly two years. The provisions left
; tor Professor Andree, the missing aero-
i naut, were found "by Mr. Wellman un-
] touched.
After leaving letters about his expe
dition and taking a collapsible house with
him, Mr. Wellman proceeded due east
i for Cape Tegethdff and arrived there July
30, TS9S. There the party landed all the
; stores and the steamer returned to Nor-
, way.
"We established our headquarters in the
: little house brought from Jackson's head-
quarters," continued Mr. Wellman, "over
i which, flew the Stars and Stripes.
"Desiring to push further north with
I the greatest speed. I dispatched Baldwin
! August 6, with the Norwegians, sledges,
I dogs and boats, myself and others intend-
! ing to follow in a few days.
"Shortly after Baldwin's departure, I
; discovered that, owing to a sudden break
[ up of the ice. 1 was unable to proceed, but
Â«I sent two Norwegians to inform Bald-
win to build his outpost, leave two men
; in charge of it, and return to my head-
quarters."
Here Lieutenant Evelyn B. Baldwin of
j the bureau told of The doings of his ex-
[ pedition. He said:
- "September 21 my party reached Cape
I Heller, in latitude Sl, where we decided to
; make an outpost.' From the very outset
. we had a constant fight with the high
: seas, ice and wind, and there was a con-
; tinual fog. The Ice underneath us parted
* with terrific crashes, leaving us adrift on
â  small floes. Here we built a station and
j called it Fort McKinley. We stocked it
i with blubber and meat, and leaving there
i two volunteers, Ventzen and Biorvlg, I
i started to return October 22 to Mr. Well-
j man's headquarters, arriving there Octo-
I ber 30 in safety, in spite of great hard-
! ships, cold, darkness and ice.
Â« "The . party spent the winter comfort-
j ably in H^rmsworth House, which was
completely nuried in snow. They killed
I many bears.
"Mr. Wellman, . February 18. 1899, with
j Norwegians with sledges and dogs,- start-
ed north." â â¢-â .
Mr. Wellman, continuing, said: "Feb
ruary 26, 1890, I arrived at Fort McKin-
ley. Bjorvig, rifle in hand, stood at the
j mouth of the snow tunnel. He wrung my
haryi and with tears in his eyes said:
'Poor Ventzen is dead.' Â»;â¢.
" "Of course, you have burled him,' I
said.
" 'No,' Bjorvig replied, lie lies there.*
pointing to the 'hut. 'I have kept my
, promise.' .x_X2
"The two men had made a compact that
In case of death the survivor should keep
! the body until help came. In the little
j hut the quick and the dead had slept side
:by side through two months of Arctic
: darkness.
"Bjorvig said he had managed to keep
: up his spirits by reciting Ibsen's poetry.
"The next day we gathered stones and
: under these we buried our dead comrade.
! A few fitting words were spoken as we
1 ; stood around ln 70 degrees of frost. After
' ; a delay of ten days the party. Including
Bjorvig, pressed north In sledges and by-
march until we reached S2 degrees, east
!of Rudolph Island. The prospects then
were most reassuring. We had three
I months of the best season before us and
| were confident of reaching 87 degrees.
1 Though we had suffered from cold we
; I were all In fine form.
"Then a seemingly trivial accident turned
- the advance into a precipitate retreat.
; While struggling with the sleds in rough
: : ice my right leg was bruised and sprained
by my falling Into a hidden crevasse. For
' ! two days I went on, and unless other cir-
! cumstances bad occurred 1 should
have pressed onward so far that I would

crushed. In the darkness and storm it
was Impossible to see a path of saretj.
Expecting to be overwhelmed at any mo-
ment by the ice, we scrambled over the
field of"ice and saved most of our equip-
ment, except the dog food, reaching a
place of safety in a -hour.
"Our brave Norwegian comrades did not
express the slightest fear. While it was
possiU'e to go on for a time my leg now

days I stumbled along until I fell. There
was nothing to do then but get on a

"The point at which we turned back was
twenty-five miles northwest of Freeden
Islands, where Dr. Nansen tended in 1895.
North of these islands we photographed
three islands and some large land unseen
either by Payer or Nansen. We also
found that Payer's so-called Dover
glacier does not exist.
"I still believe it is possible to reach the
pole by Franz Josef Land, but I cannot
say if I shall make another effort."
After Mr. Wellman's return to Harms-
worth House April 9th Baldwin and four
Norwegians went out to Wilczek Land.
, charting the unexplored east coast and
discovering a new ice-covered island ex-
tending to 64 degrees east, almost as large
as Wilczek Land. They named it Graham
Bell Land, after the president of the
American Geographical Society. 3aldwln

A. Harlan of the United States Coast
Survey also took a separate trip before
the reunited exposition sailed July 27th
on the steamer Capella.
A fairly complete survey of the archi
pelago has been prepared by Mr. Wellman
and his party. They all show traces of
hardship. Their fares are pale and drawn
and Wellman is much thinner than form
erly. His right leg is drawn up a foot
from the ground and it is not known
whether he will ever again use it. He will
consult a specialist in London Imme
diately. Otherwise he Is In good health
and spirits.

mail boat which brought the party to

The party proceeded immediately to

noon.

BROKE THE SUNDAY LAW
Valuable Fishing Nets Confiscated
Near the Sacramento River.
Deputy Game and Fish Commissioners
Davis and Cross have confiscated nearly
$800 worth of salmon nets, which have
been turned over to the â -.: .- at Valle
jo. The seizures were made because of
the violation of the law which prohibits
the taking of salmon between sundown
on Saturday evening and sundown on
Sunday evening. The deputies suspected
that nets were in several of the sloughs
up the river and on Saturday night they
went in the State launch Quintal into
Montezuma Slough, where they waited
until a proper time to make a run through
those waters. After proceeding a short
distance they found a new net worth
about $350. of aliout 2400 feet in length.
This was taken on board.
A run was then made to what is known
as "the cut-off," where two more nets,
one new, if about 400 horns in length,
and the other of about 300 fathoms. Con
sidering the value of the property and
the fact that the fall run of salmon is
now on it is possible that the unknown
owners of the new nets may make appli
cation for their fishing rigs and take the
chances of being arrested, it' they do
they will surely fall into the clutch of
the law. for warrants have been sworn
out or them. If they can secure the
minimum line of $200 they will be getting
off lucky, but the chances are against
this, for the offense is likely to be tried
in the Superior Court, where less mercy
would be shown to the violators of the
law. .

heat, finishing second on the four succeed-
ing occasions.
The attendance shows a derided ten-
. dency to "pick up" and no doubt there
: will be large crowds during the balance
;of the meeting. Roblet turned up winner
j of the 2:18 pace and The Scot, Twinkle
Twlnk and Homestake were successful ln
the running events.
Driver Dick Havey sprung the sur-
prise of the afternoon in the pace with
the Santa Rosa horse â  Roblet. A big
field of twelve scored down for the word
In this number, with Billy Baker drawing
the pole position. The 3:OP-%. made by
Clipper in a winning race at the recent
Santa Rosa meeting made that horse the
hottest sort of a favorite. Handled by
Charley Durfee. the Diablo horse was
unsteady In the first heat, and besides
drew a bsW position. However, he showed
such phenomenal speed the last half that
! it only mad.- his constituents more con-
fident, even though finishing third, the
heat going to John A, a 6. t0 1 choice. In
: the heal following EI Diablo, driven by
. Felton, earned the verdict after a dcs-
perate drive from John A. Clipper, a
1 to 2 choice, broke at the turn and was.
never prominent.
In the next heat Havey behind Roblet,
against which 20 to 1 was laid, stole the
inside position at the second turn by a
very clever piece of driving and was never
hard pressed, beating out Dlctatress with
something to spare. The conditions call-
ing for best two heats in three, all went
to the stable but John 4 and Roblet. The
latter rated a top-heavy favorite and led
from the word, stepping the mile in
--.â :>i\.
The first running event was ft six-fur-
long sprint for 2-year-olds, decided under
selling conditions. Backed from evens to
2 to 5, The Scot with Walsh up made a
runaway race of it. beating out Flush of
Gold over half a dozen lengths. Enjoy-
ment led out Champion Rose for the
show.
Al Martin thought Lost Girl tuned to
concert pitch, and with Eddie Jones on
I her back the crowd got aboard at odds
of .1 to 5 to win the mile runylt was the
mare's first race 'his season, and Jones
probably made too much early use of her.
for in a drive at the end Coburn slipped !
through next the rail with tin 8 to 1 snot
Twinkle Twlnk, winning by half a length
in l:42Vi. Donator was third.
Jones also piloted Homestake, winner
of the final seven-furlong scramble. Beat
ing his field away from the post the mare
was never headed, reaching the wire .two
lengths before P. A. Flnnegan. Fortls,
the first choice, ran fourth.

LOCAL PUGILISTS TO
FIGHT IN STOCKTON
? FRANK RAPHAEL, Who Is Matched to Box Ruf Turner.
â¦ â¦ â¦ âÂ»*-â â¦-â¦-*â¦-Â»-â¦ â¦*>â¦â¦â¦ â Â» â¦ â¦ Â» <i â¦-*$- *-&-*-& -â¦-â¬
TWO boxing matches were made yesterday that will attract a great deal of
interest In the sporting world. Frank Raphael, the local lightweight, who
recently returned from Klondike with new fistic laurels and plenty deal of
interest In the sporting world. Frank Raphael, the local lightweight, who
recently returned from Klondike with new fist ie laurels and plenty of gold
dust, will meet Ruf Turner, the colored wonder, before the Stockton Ath
letic Club on September 19, and "Cocker" Tweedie, the Australian whirl-
wind, will box Sammy Maxwell before the same club on September 23. As
both goes will be pulled off during fair week it is expected that they will attract
large bouses.
Raphael and Tweedie left last night for the scene of their contests In company
with Tim McGrath, the well-known trainer. The men will Immediately go into
training tinder the watchful eye of McGrath. Raphael Is so confident of victory
that he has backed himself to the extent of $1000. Turner has easily found back
ing for the same amount. Besides fighting for a percentage of the gate receipts,
a generous side bet will tempt the lightweights to renewed exertions, and a splen-
did bout will result.
Raphael Is even now in splendid trim. The hard work he has done In the
northern regions and the excellent care he has taken of himself has left him in
good, enough condition to enter the ring at a moment's notice. Refore he left this
city for Alaska he had defeated Sammy Maxwell and other well-known men. and
while in Dawson be cleaned up large sums by getting draws with Pat Rooney, a
heavy-weight, Dick Agnew of New York and'knocking out other men. Last spring
he fought Agnc^w again and secured the decision in the eleventh round, the referee
stopping the bout and declaring him the winner. The sum he realized in that
fight was one of the largest ever received by a lightweight, it being $3200â loser
taking $1600. If successful in his bout with Turner, Raphael intends going East
with McGrath and taking on some of the leaders In his class. He claims he Is feel
ing stronger than ever before in his life and is confident he will make a good
showing. â¢ .
McGrath will join Joe Kennedy, and will assist "Spider" Kelly In training the
local heavy-weight for his bout with Maher.
Tweedie and Maxwell will fight for a percentage of the gate receipts. "Cocker"
swears that he will train hard for the contest, as he knows he has a hard man In
Maxwell. He Is in need of funds and promises to give a good account of him
self. Maxwell has improved wonderfully since his bout with Raphael some years
ago. and will undoubtedly make it warm for Tweedie. It is probable that many of
the local sports will run up to Stockton and witness both goes, as the men are good
ringsters. They will all fight at 135 pounds.

The racing will begin at 1:30 o'clock at
Oakland to-day.
On Wednesday there will be a stock pa
rade in the forenoon.
After winning the second heat of the
pace, El Diablo pulled up so lame that the
Judges allowed him to be drawn.
It if said that Tommy Keating offered
$5000 for Clipper. last winter. The offer
was refused.
In "Monk" Coburn, the firm of Atkin &
Lottridge are ape to have the making of
another good rider. He put up a very
creditable ride astride Twinkle Twink.
Neerata, a starter in the 2:18 trot this af
ternoon, is pronounced* a corker. She
stepped two heats In a winning race at
Santa Rosa in 2:13%, 2:12%.
The well-known turfman, Dr. Rowell.
has been appointed official veterinary oi
the California Jockey Club. He has exam
ined all of the horses now quartered at
Oakland track and reports them free
from disease. As the Eastern horses ar
rive they will also be compelled to pass
musterâ a very wise precaution on the
part of the Oakland association.
Jockey Jimmy Bozeman, reinstated
some two months ago by the Turf Con
gress, is on his way back here from Chi
cago. He will be seen in the saddle at
Sacramento.
Duffy, the Montana rider, thinks he has
a kick coming. About two years ago he
was suspended by Captain Rees at Ingle
side for an indifferent ride. Last summer
Duffy received what he supposed to be a
conditional reinstatement, permitting him
to ride in Montana. It now transpires
that the reinstatement was an uncon
ditional one, and now "he Is wondering
why he did not become aware of the fact
last winter.
A carload of horses arrived at Oakland
track from St. Louis on Sunday night,
several different owners being repre
sented. 8. N. Holman brought over old
Benamela and Indro. Tom Boyle after an
unsuccessful trip came back with Ace,
Moringa and an Artillery colt. He later
shipped to Sacramento. Billy Randall's
string consisted of Ostler Joe. Montanus,
Miss Rowena and Balista. Jockey Devln,
under contract with Boyle, rode at Oak
land yesterday.

I in a driving finish the four finished heads
j apart, so close that none but the judges
I could separate them. .They gave the first
money i,, Elfin Conig, who was at 60 to 1,
i while Ten Candles got second.
In the Flying handicap nearly every
horse in the race was well backed.

D. E. Allison, a commission merchant at
Front and Washington .streets, was ar
rested yesterday by Deputy Game and
Fish Commissioner 'C, A. Vogelsang for
violating the game laws, which prohibit
having grouse in possession before the
opening of the season, which begins on
September 1. Allison had a lot of grouse
in his store last Saturday that had been
shipped to him from Lassen County. He
was very angry at Mr. Vogelsang, whom
he took for the Commissioner, and
threatened to make things so hot for him
that he would have to resign.

ADVERTISEMENTS.
I have demonstrated the fact that
weaknesses of men, the result < Â«i early
or later indiscretions, such as Drains,
Lame Back.' Varicocele, etc., will not i
yield to a stimulating treatment. This
accounts for the fact that drugs never
euro. The medicines given for these !
troubles, essentially poisonous, are in- â 
tended only to stimulate. Continuous
stimulation . must result in harm.
Thousands of patients have said to j
me: "Doctor, when I took this or that I
medicine 1 felt better in an hour, but
after a month my weakness returned,
and I was worse off than ever." "Bet-
ter in an hour" means a powerful stim-
ulant, means a wrecked constitution.
' Electricity is strength.
That's what you want â strength, not
stimulation. Electricity will never
cure in a day. it does not cure in a
week. It takes two months,- it may
take three, but the results are there
to stay. I am the inventor and intro-
ducer of the famous Dr. Sanden Elec-
tric Belt, with attachment for men. It
embodies the best efforts of my 30
years as a specialist. Worn at night,
it strengthens you when you sleep.
Current acts upon Liver, Kidneys,
Stomach, Bladder, Prostate Gland
and all weakened parts. It weighs but
five ounces. Currents instantly felt.
Over 5000. cures during 1898.
Drop in at my oflice to-day, if possi-
ble, and consult me free of charge, or

Men," which explains all. Sent in plain
sealed envelope.

that the space allotted for this purpose
is inadequate for the size of the display

of larger fish of this kind in the. rivers

rested and losing the fish as well. Tho

F, V, Meyers of ' the Southern
Pacific Appointed Com-
missioner.
George A, Knight Is Named for Attorney of
the San Francisco Board of Health,
Directors of Deaf and Dumb
and Blind Institute.
THE Governor has appointed
George A. Knight of this city to
the office of Attorney of the
Board of Health, vice Garret Mc-
Enerney. The office is easy in the
respect that the occupant has nothing
to do but receive the salary which is
Bent to him every month. Originally
the attorney was obliged to personally
apply for his salary, but as this pro
ceeding Involved a little time and
physical exertion, provision was made
to forward the compensation to the at
torney at stated periods. It is said to
be eminently proper that Mr. Knight
should hold the office, as the place was
created for him by statute. He was the
original holder of the position. When
his term expired Dennis Spencer of
Xapa was appointed his successor.
When Mr. Spencer died the vacancy
in the office was filled by the appoint
ing of Garrett McEnerney. It Is highly
creditable to Mr. McEnerney that he
gave the salary attached to the office to
the widow* of Mr. Spencer. In the of
fice of Dennis Spencer Mr. McEnerney
received his first lessons In the law, and
a sense of friendship for the family of
his teacher prompted him to bestow the
official emolument where it would have
been bestowed had Mr. Spencer lived
to serve out the term.
Fred V. Meyers of Stockton was yes
terday appointed by the Governor to
the office of Commissioner or" the Bu
reau of Labor Statistics, to succeed E.
F. Fitzgerald. The appointment was a
surprise to every one outside of the
Burns coterie in the yellow building.
There were many candidates for the
position, among them Wallace Pond of
Hand, A. J. Read of Oakland and
C. W. Kyle, chief clerk of the Assem
bly. Information came to The Call not
long since that Mr. Read was offered
.the place on certain conditions. He
"was sound * to ascertain if he would
agree to appoint "deputies rom a list
to be iced in his hands. The prop

ositlon was not acceptable to him, I
her.ee his name was not inscribed on j
the commission.
At the Palace and Grand hotels, j
â where the politicians and office seekers j
meet to exchange views, the appoint- j
ment of Mevers is spoken of as further |
proof that th- Southern Pacific Rail- I
road is the dominant power in State j
affairs.
The people of Stockton were surpris-
ed, as the following dispatch indicates:
STOCKTON. Cal.. Aug. 2S.â The an-
STOCKTON. Cal., Aug. 28.â The an-
nouncement that Gage had appointed
Fred V Meyers of this city State Labor
Commissioner came as an all around sur-
prise, if nything the Governor does is
capable of exciting surprise. Leading;
Republicans set out to Inquire who the ap
pointee was. for. although raised in this
city. he is entirely unknown in political
circles So for as is known no State.
county or city leader was consulted. As
most of the Republicans do not know who
Meyers Is the news excited no comment
pro or con as to his fitness, but there was
much comment to the effect that the Gov
ernor in hi.s abnormal anxiety to appear
Independent had evidently picked put a
dard horse. The appointee is chairman
of the grievance committee of the South-
crn Pacific Chapter of the Brotherhood of
Locomotive Engineers. In this capacity
he is very close to the railroad power and
his mysterious influence most likely came
from the big yellow building where so
many appointments are decided upon.
Personally Meyers is spoken of as a nrst
class man. He is the son of the one-time
Assemblyman, Samuel Meyers of San .
Joaquin County, and was born and raised
in this county. He entered the service ot
the Southern Pacific when a mere boy. i
He became a railroad engineer and served
In that capacity for twelve years, running
on the Southern Pacific line in and out .
of Stockton. He took a prominent part ;
in the doings of the Brotherhood of Rail-
road Engineers and was elected ,to sev
eral high offices in that organization. His :
father was a pioneer and popular citizen.
He is 42 years of age. The new commis
sioner's mother and wife are residents of
this city. but he does not spend much or :
his time here. The appointment was un
known to them until a Call representative j
showed them a dispatch containing the
news of the selection. They seemed con-
siderably surprised that Mr. Meyers had *
been the one appointed, although ac- j
knowledging that he had been making ef
forts in that direction. .i*,-..-'-^
Just how close Meyers has been to labor |
is not apparent. It is said that he was
dead against unions during the big rail
road strike. Among railroad men who
sympathized with the strikers, the ap
pointment will be regarded as a distinct
slap at aggressive unionism. Meyers was
not in the city to-day. being engaged in
work above Sacramento.
This is the first appointment which the
Governor has given to San Joaquin County
in return for 8w plurality given him in the
same ballot boxes which gave Marion
de Vries. Democratic candidate for Con
gress, nearly 1500 majority. Political ex
pediency, if not appreciation, should have
led to a consideration of the opinions of
leading Republicans. As to Mr. Meyers'
executive ability or knowledge of labor
matters very little is known here. Few
knew he was even an applicant for the
office. It is said that he ls unacquainted
with Gage, but that he had a long pull ia
evident.
GOLD BRICKS FOR

Independent.
In Alameda County the appointment
In Alameda County the appointment
of Meyers did not evoke popular en
thusiasm. Alamedans believed until
thÂ£ finish that their county would be
recognized. Xow they are talking of
gold bricks as the following comment
suggests:
OAKLAND. Aug. 28.â Governor Gage
evidently thinks that gold bricks are good
things for Alameda County. To-day he
gave absolute proof of this.
"Depend upon it. I will do something
good for Alameda County." This was the
Governor's parting remark to A. J. Read.
candidate for Labor Commissioner, two
week.- ago. after he had met the Governor
by the latter's appointment. To-day the
announcement was made that a Stockton
man had received the commission.
Three months ago it was well known
that the appointment lay between Wal
lace Pond of Berkeley and A. J. Read of
Oakland. The Governor made direct
promises that one'of these two men
should have the position. It developed
later that the man who received the plum
must be a tool of Colonel Burns. When
Mr. Read was summoned to appear before
the Governor at the Palace Hotel he was
led to believe that the commission was
about to be handed to him. Such was the
Governor's intention, but there was a rope
attached to it with as many strands as
there are clerks and deputies to be named
by the State Labor Commissioner.
A. J. Read was plainly informed that
if he was given the job he would have to
name as his assistants and deputies men
whom the Governor and Colonel Burns
had agreed upon. He was told that in so
many words, and being too Independent to
accept an honor on such dishonorable
terms he came back to Oakland.
A. J. Read had received the indorsement
of many of the labor organizations and
among his supporters were Dr. Pardee,
Victor H. Metcalf, Frank A. Leach, Col
onel John P. Irish and many other men
to whom the Governor had declared he
would give this county favorable consid
eration.
As usual, the Governor has snubbed the
whole county.
Mr. Read was asked to-night what he
thought of the Governor's appointment.
"it is a complete surprise to me," he
said. "If it were not for the assurances
originally given out by the Governor that
the commlssionership would be given to
a man from this county I would never
have been In the fight. It is true he sent
for me a couple of weeks ago and the
thing seemed to be about settled. I have
never heard of Mr. Meyers of Stockton
being a candidate for the place and cer
tainly lf he has dor.c any active work or
has presented proof of such work to thÂ«
Governor, then Mr. Gage grossly misrep
resented affairs to me when I saw horn."
Mr. Read admitted that something was
said to him about the patronage, but de
clined to enter into the exact details.
Even some of the executive's closest
friends have stated recently that the Gov
ernor had promised to appoint either
Read or Pond.
The Governor yesterday appointed
John H. Grindley and George Reed of
Oakland, and William S. Wells of Mar
tine*, directors of the Deaf and Dumb
and Blind Asylum at Berkeley.

in making the definite announcement that
ho is not an aspirant for the nomination
and will not consent to the use of his
name in the convention. When spoken to
yesterday on this topic, Mr. Spreckels
said:
â¢â¢You may publish the statement as
coming from me that I am not a candi
date for Mayor and would not accept the
nomination if it were tendered to me. I
am too busy now to engage in politics and
do not want my name placed before the
convention as a candidate for any office.
I make this statement in the sincere hope
that it will end tin- discussion so far as it
relates to the proposed candidacy of my
self."
Since the return of the California Volun
teers. Colonel Victor D. Duboce has been
sounded regarding his inclinations toward
the Mayoralty of San Francisco. Colonel
Duboce* is a stanch Republican and many
of his friends believe that he could win
out if placed at the head of the Republi
can ticket. The impression exists that he
would accept the nomination should the
Republican convention display a unani
mous desire for his leadership in the ap
proaching political campaign. When the
subject was brought to his attention yes
terday he requested that discussion of the
topic be deferred until the finish of his
military service.
There is trouble in store for Jasper
McDonald, chairman of the Democratic
local nominating convention. The dele
gates placed upon him the responsibility
of naming a committee of seven to select
candidates for the Board of Supervisors.
It would be an easy thing for Mr. McDon
ald to get a list of seven from Gavin Mc-
Nab and Mayor Phelan, but the dele
gates to thÂ« convention are expressing
with considerable earnestness a desire to
be consulted in the selection of the com
mittee. Yesterday Mr. McDonald reached
the decision that a consultation with the
various delegations might result in the
submission of good material. This is cer
tainly a wise decision. Many names will
be submitted and from th- long list Gavin
McNab will surely find seven that will
stand for his slate.
In regard to forty members of the
County Committee which the chairman
is authorized to appoint, delegations will
doubtless be consulted, but no names will
go on the chosen list of forty without the
consent of Gavin McNab. These forty
added to the out-and-out slat.- supporters
already chosen by the district delegations
will give Mr. McNab the power to direct
party affairs.
The district County Committeeman or
dinarily has no higher aim in politics than
that of obtaining a little influence at the
City Hall so that Flaherty's horse and
cart may be engaged for street work, but
the committeeman at large strikes higher.
The forty to be chosen by the chairman
will shake the political tree for the rich
plums. They will direct affairs of the
party and reap the reward of rich patron
age in the event of Democratic success.
The district -gates will have a chance
to make suggestions regarding the forty
at large, but the "at largers" will be ap
pointed by Gavin Mr Nab. "The power be
hind the throne is greater than the throne
itself." __ .

The last victim of vicissitudes in the
family of John Durr, once one of the best
known merchants in San Francisco, lies
in a cell at the California-street police
station awaiting transportation to the
Almshouse. He is Patrick Durr, a son,
partially paralyzed, who has earned his
crusts of bread by begging for the past
several years. He was picked up by the
police on Montgomery street yesterday
afternoon and taken to the station, from
which place he will be sent to exist, prob
ably the remainder of his days, on public
charity. Like the others of his family
who aie now languishing in public insti
tutions, pride forces him to seclusion and
he gave to the booking officer at the sta
tion the name of Phil .ucGovern, the
name he has been known by since the tide
of fortune turned against himself and
father.
The story of the Durrs has been a sad
one. In the early days of San Francisco
the dry goods firm of Kennedy & Durr,
located on Third street, near Market, was
one of the most substantial business
houses on the coast. It held an enormous
trade and its proprietors became men of
opulence. John Durr, one of the firm,
soon dabbled in stocks. From the day he
made his first purchase on Pine street his
means began to vanish and soon he found
himself without standing in the business
community. He sought occupation as
clerk and finally passed with his family
Into social oblivion.
The nert occasion on which the public
recalled the name of Durr was November
12. â¢ 17, when The Call published a pitiable
story of destitution in a small hovel on
Valencia street. Officer Holbrook investi
gated the case and found John Durr and
his three daughters In a state of utter
destitution and starvation. They were too
proud of what had once been their lot in
life to make an appeal to charity or even
to their neighbors for assistance and bo
existed in filth and penury until their con
dition excited official attention. On No
vember 14 John Durr and his three daugh
ters-were adjudged insane and committed
to the asylum at Ukiah.
Patrick, the last of the family, has
struggled with misfortune for some time.
He drank heavily and later became para
lyzed. He has been a familiar character
on the streets, but those who met him
daily little guessed his identity. His rea
son "for concealing his name was the same
which caused his father and sisters to
face starvation in a hovelâ pride. He will
be taken to the Almshouse to-day.

JOHN W. MACKAY HERE.
The Millionaire Mining Man Comes
to Look After His Business Affairs.
J. W. Mackay, the millionaire mining
man, arrived at the Palace last night
from Virginia City. It was reported that
he was coming for the purpose of settling
the estate of the late Mrs. James G. Fair.
As the Fair estate will not be ready for
settlement for a year or more yet this is
an error. While Mr. Mackay comes on
business connected with the estate of his
partner's widow, it is not that alone which
brings him here. His heavy mining inter
ests and other business enterprises extend
through many States, and are particular
ly extensive in this State. It is to look
after these matters, as well as to attend
to his duties as an administrator, that the
famous mining man Is now here.
Mr. Mackay is not sure how long he will
remain. Probably for several days, and
perhaps for several weeks. It will all de
pend on the length of time that it will
take him to go through his business. He
will then return either to the East or to
Virginia City. His plans are not definite
ly decided.

The Government has chartered another
The Government has chartered another
British steamer to carry troops and sup
plies to Manila. This makes ten trans-
ports that will be ready to leave within
the next fortnight and two more are ex
pected from the Philippines that will leave
again as soon as they can be got ready.
The new transport Is the Sikh, a vessel
that has been in the Oriental trade for
nearly ten years, but came here from Yo
kohama under charter to John Rosen
feld's Sons. She was to have gone into
the coal trade, but will now be fitted out
to carry troops. The Sikh was built in
ISS9 by Wlgham. Richardson & Co. of
Newcastle, England, for the Mogul
Steamship Company. She is 1787 tons net
burden, 335 feet long, 40 feet broad and 25
feet 8 inches deep. She is a very roomy
vessel. Is fitted throughout with electricity
and will make a valuable addition to the
fleet of transports. She carries almost an
entire crew of Asiatics, but nearly all of
these will be replaced with white labor
before the steamer returns here from
Manila.
On May 2Sth last the Sikh was in New
York. From there she went to Singapore,
thence to Hongkong, Shanghai. Hioko and
Yokohama. At the latter port she was
chartered to come to San Francisco.
Of the other transports the Warren and
City of Puebla will get away this week.
The Puebla has been painted white and
looks well in her new dress. She will
probably get away this afternoon or to
morrow. The Warren has almost com
pleted loading and is scheduled to sail
Thursday. The Columbia is coaling at the
Government wharf. She will be painted
white this week. The Hancock is a; the
Union Iron Works, but her repairs are
completed and to-day she will go into the
stream and coal. The Sherman came ofT
the drydock yesterday and she also will
coal in the stream. The Centennial is
coaling at the Government wharf and the
Leelanaw is loading at Harriso-i-sLreet
wharf. Both these vessels will take sway
a load of horses. The George W. Elder
Is now at Astoria and the Belgian King at
San Diego. Both vessels will arrive Here
during the week and will be fitted tut as
transports. The Grant is now out twenty
nine days and the Sheridan nineteen days
from Manila. Both these vessels should
be on their way back to Manila by the
middle of September. The hospital ship
Relief goes to Hunter's Point drydock to
day and after an overhauling she also will
return to Manila. It was originally in
tended to send her back empty, but if the
Government finds itself pressed for ships
she may take back a load of troops. These
vessels will carry all told between 11,000
and 12,000 soldiers and all of them will be
on the way before September 20th.
An American sailor is being tried in
Yokohama for most brutal murders and
the officers and men of the steamer
Sikh are commenting upon the fairness
of the Japanese court. Robert Miller was
an A. B. on the American ship Tarn
O'Shanter. At Yokohama he fell in love
with Tonooka Suye, a Japanese, woman
who was running a saloon under the name
of George Henry, a sailor on the United
States steamer Olympia. Miller deserted
his ship and went to live in the house kept
by Tonooka Suye. He wanted her to put
the house under his name and she at flrst
consented, but finding that Miller was
drinking heavily, changed her mind.
Helping Tonooka Suye in the saloon was
a maid servant named Suzuki Aki. In love
with Suzuki was another American sailor
named Nelson Ward. Miller did not like
Ward, and when he saw the latter in the
house with Suzuki Aki the day Tonooka
Suye refused to put the saloon ln his
name he got angry. That night when
everybody was asleep Miller armed him
self with a razor and a hammer and start
ed to run amuck. He entered Ward's
room and after slashing him with the
razor beat his brains out with the ham
mer. He then went into the room of Su
zuki Aki and beat her brains out, and
then served Tonooka Suye in the same
manner. Miller then made his escape, but
was captured and was under trial for his
life before Judge Miy ajl ma Kenjlro when
the Sikh sailed from Yokohama.
The British ship King David has ar
rived at Antwerp after experiencing some

Attempted Murder on the Spring-burn.
There was trouble on the British ship
Springburn last Saturday night, and in
consequence there is a warrant out for
the arrest of Pat Troy on a charge of as
sault to murder. It appears that four of
the crew of the Springburn went away
without leave on Friday night and were
severely reprimanded by Chief Officer
Hiram Martin. On Saturday afternoon
the four men went to the mate and asked
for leave to see the parade, and incident
ally for some money to spend. Their re
quest was refused, and there was con
siderable grumbling in consequence. That
night at 9 o'clock, while the mate was
asleep in his room, Troy entered and be
gan beating him. Martin jumped out of
bed and Troy seized a sword that was
hanging over the mate's bed. Hearing
somebody coming, Troy ran away and
took the sword with him. Yesterday morn
ing Officer Crosbie found it hid in a wood
pile on the front and took It to the Har
bor Police Station, but no trace of Troy
was found. (

SAN JOSE AND
WATSONVILLE
TEAMS DROPPED
San Jose and Watsonville are no longer I
represented in the California Baseball !
League. The two teams, which have been |
playing ball under the auspices of the j
towns mentioned, were dropped at a meet- !
ing of the league last night. Due and de
liberate consideration was given by the
officials before action was taken in the
matter.
The meeting was called to order in the
offices of T. F. Bonnet by J. T. Moran,
president of the California League. There
were present Vice President E. F. Bert,
Secretary T. F. Bonnet and the following
club managers: Harris of San Francisco, j
Dennie of Sacramento, Tuttle of Santa j
Cruz, Ewing of Oakland and Morris of
Watsonville. . . .
Immediately upon the meeting being j
called to order Manager Harris intro
duced the subject of the condition of af
fairs in the league, referring particularly j
to the management of the San Jose club.
He explained that the club had been un- j
der the control of a Mr. La Rosa who
sold a large number of general admission
passes and then dropped out of the man
agement, taking the money with him
wnich he derived from the sale of passes.
George Borchers, he continued, had an in- ;
terest in the team and ran it along up to
May 15. when the league was notified that
owing to lack of support and the use of
the passes sold by La Rosa the new man- j
agement got no money at all. and would
have to quit if some remedy was not in
troduced immediately. Harris stated that
he and Mr. Bonnet went down to &an
Jose and induced Dr. W. F. McGraw- to
take charge of the team, and only suc
ceeded in doing so by assuring the doctor
he would be protected against any loss
he might entail. Since then the club has
beeâ¢ run at a steady loss to the Recrea
tion Park Association, owing to internal
dS" urther stated that on top of this
the Watsonville team began to fan behind
in receipts owing to the mismanagement
of Struve. And because its present man
ager Mr. Morris, wanted to be guaran
teed a certain sum for expenses, etc it
was decided to have the meeting called.
At the conclusion of the preliminary
statement of Manager Harris Cal Ew-mg
moved that San Jose's franchise be for
feited The motion was seconded by Den
nie of Sacramento and was carried unani
mously. -; Â * .. .x.,
Manager McGraw came in just at this
moment and asked that before the club
was dropped he be allowed to express his
sentiments. The motion was carried. Dr.

.THE â¢ EMPORIUM. O
McGraw stated that he entered the base
ball field as a novice, but had been treated
courteously by the San Francisco man
agement.
As it was impossible to run a five-club
league it was decided that the league be
composed of four clubs. Manager Ewing
moved that the league for the remainder
of the season be composed of Oakland
San Francisco, Santa Cruz and Sacra
mento, as each of the clubs mentioned' was
in a flourishing condition. Dennie sec
onded the motion and It was carried. A
committee of three, composed of Dennie,
Tuttle and Ewing, was appointed to pre
pare a revised schedule and submit thÂ©
same within twenty-four hours.
Before adjourning President Moran
stated that he thought it possible to run
a six-team league next year if thÂ© clubs
were properly managed at the outset.
With the two clubs out of it the race for
the championship pennant becomes
keener and the lovers of baseball in thÂ©
cities with teams in the league will bÂ©
treated to some lively games.

THE CONGRESSIONAL OUTLOOK.
rROM interviews obtained by The Call and
the New York Herald, with members of Con-
gress, the public is given for the first time reli
able information concerning the course which will
bepursued at the coming session upon the important
questions of the Speakership of the Housf, the lead
ership of.the minority and the issues of currency
letorm and of trusts.
For some time past it has-been pretty well under
stood that despite the number of aspirants for the
Speakership, David B. Henderson of lowa would be
chosen for the position. The poll made by The Call
and the Herald now shows that Henderson's lead has
become so strong his competitors have virtually re
tired from the contest and the prospect is he will be
elected without opposition in his own party. The
Democrats are not so well agreed as to whom they
will choose for their leader. The many factions of
that party in the country have more or less represen
tation in Congress and the factional disputes there
are as notable as elsewhere. Nevertheless, the indi
cations are the leadership will be given to DeArmond
of Missouri, the party being about as tired of Bailey
of Texas as he is tired of trying to lead men who will
not be led.
One of the most satisfactory disclosures made by
the interviews is the strength of the sentiment among
Republican members in favor of grappling with the
currency problems in earnest and at once. From the
statements made it is learned the Republican Con
gressmen are virtually united in support of the cur
rency bill which will he reported by the currency
committee named by the Republican caucus. They
expect this measure to establish the gold standard
unequivocally and to increase national bank circula
tion, while breaking the "endless chain" of green
backs. Democrats from the South and West will ad
vocate free silver coinage, the withdrawal of national
bank circulation, the retention of the greenback sys
tem and the removal of the tax on State bank-notes.
On the subject of trusts the interviews arc naturally
more vague than on the other questions: That issue
has not yet been clearly defined. The introduction
of this new and powerful force in the world of indus
try and trade has caused a disturbance of business
conditions and inevitably engendered antagonisms.
Consequently, there is a good deal of clamor against
trusts, but much of it is as unreasonable as that which
was raised in a former generation against the intro
duction of machinery.
Senator Depew has expressed the conviction that
in the next Presidential campaign both parties will
declare against trusts in the national platform and
that neither would undertake to suppress them. Such
a declaration while cynical is not far from the truth.
Intelligent men of all parties recognize that some re
strictions must be placed upon trusts to prevent
abuses, but until the nature of these abuses is more
fully understood, and some definite policy in regard
to them is formulated, the issue cannot be made one
of party politics.
The people of Havana are evidently becoming
well fitted for citizenship in our glorious republic, for.
the bakers, the masons and the hackmen are on a
strike and other workingmen are inclined to follow
their example. There is nothing so easy as adapting
one's self to the ways of liberty.
The Postoffice Department has often been indebted
to the West for useful hints. Here is another: Just
outside of Kansas City, the other day. two fast mail
trains going at full speed smashed into each other.
The mail was distributed in a jiffy throughout the sur
rounding country.
The natives of Manila must be very hard to please,
for it is stated that when the American commander in
the city gave the self-styled "amigos" a chance to
show their friendliness by digging trenches and clean
ing streets under military supervision, they didn't like
it.
The future historian will write that the biggest
things brought about by the Spanish war were the
reception of the California boys on their return home
and the exposition of San Francisco as an illuminated
town.
BRYAN WEAKENING.
WHATEVER" strength" DemolrafiJ party
ever had came to it because of- its conserva
tism. lii a republic there must be government
by parties, and the Democracy for many years suc
ceeded in holding the Government by ultra conserva
tism. It was the analogue in American .politics of
the English Tories, whose modern title of "Conserva
tives" has been adopted as exactly descriptive of their
party position.
In 1896 the New Democracy changed all this and
became the representative of all forms of radicalism.
Its platform attacked at two or three points our con
stitutional system of government and threatened
ominously every safeguard of property rights. Mr.
Bryan was himself a man without property or gainful
vocation. He had practiced at a little law and a little
journalism and a good 'deal of politics. The hard
times had disemployed vast numbers of men, had
taken the profits out- of the business of another vast
contingent that had business investments, and had
sown the country with discontent which was easily
blown into flames by any leader sufficiently reckless
and restless. So many millions were pinched in their
wages, their incomes, their means of support, their
fuel, food and shelter, that no sorcery was required to
rouse them to a revolutionary pitch against all whose
prudence or good fortune had prepared them for the
crisis and put them above the hard orders of neces
sity which it brought. They were ready to elect to
the Presidency a man who professed a fellow feeling
and exploited the same needs which they felt Any
man whose prudence had prepared him to outlast the
panic was not suited to the times as a candidate of
all this discontent. In all the prosperous years pre
ceding the panic Mr. Bryan had neglected any pru
dent provision. The squalor in his affairs was not
mitigated by any share in the good things of good
times which had to be won by industry and applica
tion. In his profession, the law, all things come by
hard labor, none by luck.. Therefore, nothing came
to him. ;
He now confronts a changed situation. Our indus
tries are all in action. Crops are good. Trade is
brisk. There are but few idle who are able and will
ing to work.
As an idler and a man with no vocation Mr. Bryan
stands practically alone among the public men of
the country. His old appeals to discontent are ad
dressed to men too busy to listen. The panic has
passed like a bad dream, and the country is opposed
to bringing on another by any radical political experi
ment. Bryan has attempted to install himself in
leadership of a partisan anti-imperial issue, but his
discussion of that subject is so shallow and puerile
that it makes no appeal to the profound men who
fathom all of its depths. So he returns again and
again to the line of appeal that he used in 1896.
The people may be careless in their choice of public
officers in minor matters. They may turn a willing or
a careless ear to the solicitations of the professional
politician in choosing minor officers. But when it
comes to electing a President they don't want a man
without a calling. They have always chosen a dif
ferent class of men. Planters and farmers, profes
sional men, who can earn a living without politics,
or men who have mightily achieved for the country
and won its gratitude by great deeds and sacrifices
are the beneficiaries of the ballot when a President is
to be elected.
If Mr. Bryan had. settled down after 1806 in the
practice of his profession and had been successful.
had become known as a lawyer of respectable stand
ing and had made his living by the hard work which
success in that profession requires, he would be
stronger to-day he is.
But he did not do this. He has made his bed and
board in politics ever since, and has lived on the
sometimes generous bounty of his supporters. True,
he may have made more in this way than he could
have made by work, but after all it is a species of
charity that does not dignify him nor put him in the
great mass of his countrymen who live by work.
These considerations appeal to the keenly practical
men in his party and leave him with no whole-hearted
support, except by spoils hunters like Croker or
revolutionists and reds like Altgeld. These two
classes control the party organization and will exer
cise to the most radical limit the power to exclude
all conservatism from the convention. Mr. Bryan
will be nominated and will be again beaten, because
his impassioned appeal will be made to a country in
which' prosperity and contentment have replaced the
discontent and restlessness which were rife in 1896.
The feeling in the South is such that at this moment
ir. is probable that a majority of the Southern States
will rebuke radicalism by throwing their electo"al
votes away from him. while at the same time they
choose Democratic State Governments for the pro
tection of their local position.
There is one recourse open to General Mercier
without leaving France. He can join Guerin and
practice revolution in the seclusion of a home circle
by alternately defying the police and imploring per
mission to receive donations of bread and a leg of
mutton.
LATE PHILIPPINE REPORTS.
TWO extended reports of the Philippine situation
have recently been published. One relates to
the necessities of the military situation and its
requirements. That situation arises in the practically
unanimous devotion of the people to the cause repre
sented by Aguinaldo. It is announced that in order
to bring the people to their senses a strict coast and
inland blockade has been found necessary to cut off
food supplies, and starve into submission the non-
military supporters of the Aguinaldo Government.
j Spain always found this policy necessary in dealing
I with her disobedient subjects in the Philippines and
in Cuba. Wcyier applied it with a strictness and
severity which decimated the population, but even
then did not succeed. The resources of Spain and
her power to make such a policy successful did not
equal ours, and there is no doubt that we can,' riot
only continue to prevail as we have in the field opera
tions against those people, but that we can strike
! them far more fatally and effectively by starvation.
They are a dense population. They are apparently
united and will fight as long as they can feed. They
have a deadly climate as their ajly. When we use
starvation as ours, we have the odds by reason of our
superior strength and inexhaustible military re-'
sources. The island of Cuba has only a million and
a half of people and it was estimated that Weyler
had disabled more than half of them by starvation
and had by that means destroyed the lives of a quarter
of a million. That we can do better than this in the
Philippines is the well-settled opinion of our military
authorities, as shown by the dispatches referred to.
The other report is on a subject collateral to the
foregoing, i It is to the effect that members of the
Peace Commission held elections for Mayor in sev
eral cities on Luzon. Under their authority the peo
ple of San Pedro Macate, Baliuag, Imus and some
other cities elected Mayors, who took charge of the
municipal governments and their revenues. In every
case it was found that the voters had chosen active

sympathizers with Aguinaldo, who at once proceeded
to use their- power and revenues in his interest. To
stop* this 'they all had to be arrested by our military
-authorities and put in jail in Manila. It is said their
trial for treason will follow and we suppose they will
be shot, as an admonition to their successors. These
events show the deep seated support of Aguinaldo
by those people. The cities named. are within our lines,
where no threats nor terrorism by Aguinaldo could
reach them. They were sure of our military protec
tion against him and yet they proved to be as thor
oughly subject to his influence and in sympathy with
his purposes as if they were within his lines and
reachable by his vengeance. The devastation of their
fields and the effective application of the policy, of
rigid starvation seems to be all that is left to our
military authorities to reach their case.
The last dispatch commenting on this says that
these occurrences have ended all ideas of leniency
among the Americans. Their patience has evapor
ated as Weyler's did, and they are fully prepared to
put in force the only plan that he ever found effective.
The dense population renders this easier than it looks.
The food resources of tropical countries are not good.
The work in Philippine fields is mostly done by
Chinese, and the exclusion order of General Otis,
forbidding Chinese to come, is a severe blow in line
with the new policy of reducing the population by
starvation and using hunger to humble the spirit of
the survivors.
On the sentimental side of it, the argument is prop
erly made that starvation as a part of our military
j tactics cannot increase our unpopularity among the
i people. They are practically unanimous against us
I now, and their sentiments cannot be changed by
j anything we do or leave undone. When men of the
j high scholastic standing held' by the members of
I our Peace Commission conduct elections among
i them and they persist in electing the candidates who
j agree with the native aspirations, it is plain that they
j are insusceptible to any high appreciation of the pur
i pose for which they are permitted to vote at all.
The committee of one hundred job chasers is hav
ing such a good time in the Democratic convention,
it has almost forgotten that the chasing of the jobs
will have to be done before the public and that the
job is a long way ahead and running like a deer.
GOOD reports come from Sacramento to the
effect that the prospects of the State Fair are
exceptionally bright and promising. In the
spacious pavilion every inch of the floor space has
been taken by exhibitors with the understanding that
their booths must possess artistic merit and that in
their displays nothing commonplace will be allowed.
It is particularly gratifying to note that entries
already made show that the exhibits of California
products in all departments of the pavilion display
will be large, varied and of a high class. Such ex
hibits will be sure to attract the particular attention
of all visitors, whether they be Californians or persons
from other States. The chief object of the fair is to
afford an opportunity for annual exhibits of the pro
gress of the industrial development of the State in
all branches, and as a consequence the dominant
thought in the mind of an intelligent student of the
exhibit will be to sec how. far that development has
gone, and what it has accomplished in the way of
providing for all the needs of civilization.
There is no reason why the State Fair should not
attain on the Pacific Coast such eminence in the way
of an annual exposition as to attract and hold the
attention of people in all parts of the country. It
should be an exhibit at which men can see each year
what has been accomplished in their lines of indus
try, what improvements have been made in imple
ments and machinery and what results achieved by
new methods of work whether it be agricultural, me
chanical or artistic.
The Directors of the State Agricultural Society
have this year made earnest efforts to awaken an
interest in the Fair among all classes of citizens and
in all localities. They have offered strong induce
ments for county exhibits and for the display of the
products of cities. The result of their efforts will be
but partially disclosed this year, for the impetus given
now will go over to the succeeding year and tend to
make the exhibits of 1900 even better than those of
this season. The outlook, therefore, is promising not
only for the present but for the future, and all Cali
fornians may well be gratified with the prospect.
If the French had been wise in the management of
attractive sensations they would have kept the Drey
fus trial for the exposition year and held it in the
biggest hall in Paris.
SUPREMACY IN THE TRANSVAAL.
ONE by one the minor points in the controversy
between the Boers and the British have been
eliminated and the crisis is now reached on the
single issue of which of the two Governments has
paramount authority over the Transvaal.
According to late reports President Kruger and
the Boer Council are willing to concede everything
the British Commissioner has demanded, but couple
the concession with the condition that it be recog
nized as a concession only and that Great Britain
abrogate all her claims of suzerainty over the repub
lic. On the other hand, the Salisbury Government
is more persistent in asserting suzerainty than in de
manding redress for the alleged wrongs done to the
Outlanders, and the issue is thus brought to a point
that undoubtedly portends war.
In a speech delivered at Birmingham on Saturday,
Mr. Chamberlain declared the situation to be threat
ening and condemned President Kruger for pro
crastinating and for making offers accompanied by
conditions whicii he knows will not be accepted. The
speaker went on to say the action of the Boers com
pel the British to strengthen their force in South
Africa and make ready for w3r. He added:
"If this delay continues much longer, we shall not
hold .ourselves limited by what we have already
effered, but having taken this matter in hand we wili
not let go until 'we have secured conditions which,
once for all, will establish us as the paramount power
in South Africa and secure for us our objects there â
equal rights and privileges promised by President
Kruger when the Transvaal's independence was
granted.
It appears we are about to witness another- scene
of that long drama in which the weak peoples are
crushed to make room for aggressive ambitions of
the strong. The little nations are being swallowed
up by the "benevolent assimilation" of the big nations
with imperial missions to civilize the world and estab
lish liberty through the power of the heavier guns and
the larger battalions. The Boers, however, are going
to be a tough morsel for even so voracious a lion as
that of Her Britannic Majesty to swallow. Kruger's
procrastination has not been a waste of time. He has
been arming his brave Boers for a final struggle for
the independence of their country, and it may be that
through his indomitable courage the Transvaal, may'
stand in Africa like. Switzerland in Europe â home
of unconquered and unconquerable freemen.
THE STATE FAIR,
JUDGE HILTON'S RISE
WITH STEWART MILLIONS
How He Rose From a Lawyer's Clerk to Be
One. of the Greatest Powers in
New York.
THE LATE JUDGE HILTON.
JUDGE HENRY HILTON, who died
last Thursday In New York, became
conspicuous through his connection
with the estate of Alexander Stewart,
the dry goods millionaire.
The first dozen years of Hilton's life
have always been hidden in mystery. His
parentage, tha exact place of his birth
and even the date of his birth are un-
known. He would never tell of them.
But from the best information obtain-
able the ex-Judge was born in New York
city about seventy-five years ago, and
it ls said his father was a carter. The
first thing definitely known is that he be-
came a clerk ln the law office of Camp
-1 bell & Cleveland in Grand street, when
he was about 15 years old.
An Indefatigable worker, he became
managing clerk qf the firm and was such
when Alexander Turnly Stewart, the man
who had come penniless from Ireland and
a client of the firm, was being talked
about as a very successful business man.
Stewart's business was gradually out-
growing his store at Broadway and
Chambers street, and he was planning to
build a great white marble structure that
would be the greatest store in the coun-
He frequently consulted the law firm on
his plans. The lawyers turned them over
in a great measure to the managing clerk
and soon Stewart began consulting direct
with the subordinate. The big structure
which Stewart erected was in great part
the result of young Hilton's advice.
A few years later Hilton resigned every-
thing else to become private counsel and
confidential secretary of the. great mer-
chant prince. He soon became acquainted
with every detail of the vast business. He
counseled Stewart to move uptown. The

THE CALL'S SOUVENIR EDITION
PRAISED BY THE PRESS
â â¢â¢'-'' A MARVELOUS ISSUE.
Nevada City Transcript.
The San Francisco Call supplement Issued yesterday morning In celebration
of the First California Regiment's return from the Philippines was one of the
most complete and elaborate publications of the kind that has ever yet been
achieved by any newspaper in the world. 'It is not only richly illustrated but
the letterpress tells in graphic manner the 'history of the regiment's tribulations
and triumphs. . r^-
The flrst of the eight pages is devoted to a picture of the transport Sherman
plowing her way through the Golden Gate, that stands out with the vividness of
an oil painting. The other illustrations that adorn' every page are equally an
propriate and spirited. * p"
.The most notable of these is a full- page illustration of the heroic Califor
. nians charging to the rescue of the Pennsylvanians when those gallant soldiers
were attacked by the Spaniards .during a terrific storm on the night of Juiv 11
IS9B-the first battle of the Philippine war. The grim face of Brigadier General
James F. Smith, together with that of Colonel Victor Duboce and all the other
officers of the regiment, looks from the fourth page of the supplement and on the
fifth page is a figure of California, mourning her heroic dead surrounded by pic-
tures of all the gallant men who fell victims to the foemen's bullets or the deadly-
Philippine climate. Â« , * xxx.

The Call's picture of the returning Sherman is magnificent and adds another
to the long string of that paper s triumphs in the line of marine views. Boys
who love ship 6 should get this picture and save it.

big store at Broadway and Ninth street
was the result. He invested the $3,000,000
income of Stewart. He was a figure in
all the great merchant's projects. In the
fifties he married. Then he became Judge
of the Court of Common Pleas. In 1563 he
became Park Commissioner under Tweed.
When the Tweed ring was at its height
of its prosperity the splendid project of
the Viaduct Rapid Transit road was
launched. Hilton was exceedingly close
to Tweed and Sweeney and the other
leaders. .Stewart was a great property
owner and a merchant, and his
approval and cV-operation were of prime
importance. As long as the "Merchant
Prince" lived he fought every scheme
looking to the building of a street car
line on Broadway, and defeated project
after project looking to that end. He was
the largest individual property owner on
the great street and believed that the
parallel Iron rails would depreciate real
estate values on it. Ninety per cent of
the other owners had supreme confidence
in his judgment, and their consent to the
car line could never be obtained. At this
time Stewart's name was a tower of
strength to any enterprise. To Hilton
was assigned the task of interesting him
in the viaduct line. Tweed and Sweeney
saw untold millions' in its construction
after the fashion of the new Courthouse.
A dazzling picture of the great advan
tages the road would bring to the city
was held up to the eyes of Mr. Stewart.
Hilton eloquently dwelt on the vast rev
enues it would yield to Its stockholders,
who would be held In everlasting honor
for their splendid enterprise. Mr. Stew
art was captivated by the project and
pledged himself to take something like
$100,000 worth of the stock. Other emi
nent merchants, , bankers and capitalists
promised their support. A meeting was
held, directors were elected and Henry
Hilton was chosen psesident of the board. ;
Hilton used all the $100,000 In fitting up
the offices, and when the Tweed ring
' broke up the project fell through. â 
! ANOTHER CHANCE FOR THE.JUDGE.
A T Stewart had a sincere admiration
1 f or General Grjmt^and when the 22 ye
â  ment was started to bri rfc TTlrfi fofwafd as
l a candidate for the Presidency no one was
I more active ln it than the merchant mil-
lionaire. This was another chance for the
Judge to strut and swell and run
things " There were conferences and con-
sultations with leading statesmen and
politicians, merchants and capitalists.
eminent lawyers and bankers. There
were dinners and receptions, public meet-
ings and private ones in counting-rooms
and club parlors, correspondence with
strong and powerful men all over the
Union. The great object in view was to
harmonize all differences of opinion and
weld together a strong party in support
of the victory of Appomattox. At first the
Democracy thought of putting him in
nomination. It was argued that he never
had voted the Republican ticket in his
life; that he was an old Democrat. With-
in the highest councils of the Republican
party there was a strong opposition to
the conqueror of the rebellion.
Â£ No man contributed more than Stewart
in turning the tide in favor of Grant In
this city. He gave a great dinner party
to General Grant at the Fifth-avenue
Palace, .at which were the foremost men
of the city. It was the first time that
many of them had met the first soldier of
the republic. The guests of Mr. . Stewart
on that occasion were dazzled by a golden
dinner service such as few men under the
rank of royalty ever possessed. About
that dinner service there will be some-
thing to say later on. Then followed a
great mass-meeting in favor of Grant at
the Cooper Union. Stewart had been the
mainspring of the affair, and he was so
confident that he would be chosen to pre-
side that he asked in advance his confi
dential cashier. Mr. Hopkins, if he would
act as one of the secretaries, which the
newspapers of the time show that he did.
In all this Grant business Hilton was the
mere messenger and clerk of Stewart.
And here we have another illustration
of the extraordinary fatality that has at-
tended everything that the once powerful
merchant possessed. Since Hilton s mar-
velous absorption of the Stewart millions
to him and not to his great benefactor
has been given the sole credit for having
been instrumental in elevating Grant to
the Presidency. Only a few days ago this
sentence occurred In a complimentary
newspaper sketch of the Judge:
"In 1868 he worked hard for the election
of General Grant to the Presidency."
Yes, but it was as the paid servant of
Stewart. Hilton in all his life never
"worked" for anybody unless he was well
rewarded for his services. Who was Hil-
ton at this time that he should have been
of the slightest consequence in the elec
tion of a Republican candidate to the chief
magistracy of the republic?
HIS OWN .RATING.
In the first place, he was known as one
of the intimate associates of Tweed and
Peter B. Sweeney and "Dick" Connolly
and the rest of the plundering gang. They
made him a Park Commissioner. He wai
one of the men upon whom they could d*
pend in all their schemes and projects.
I He was unknown in the world of trade.
| The only standing he had was that which
came from his position as the private
; counsel of A. T. Stewart. He was a mem
; ber of a law firm, but his standing at the
â¢ bar was never rated very high, except by
'â  himself. It is ludicrous to speak of Hil
' ton's services to General Grant in bring
| ing him forward as a Presidential candi-
date. It was Stewart who helped Grant,
I and it was Hilton who did the routine
I drudgery, which was amply paid for in
' Stewart's golden checks. Hilton's salary
I at this time must have been about $20,000
a year, and later on it went up to $30,000.
The tremendous effort Stewart made In
: behalf of General Grantâ an effort Grant
thoroughly understood, and when he be
; came President showed that he appreci
i atedâ . perhaps the most unselfish act
iin Stewart's life* With all Stewart's
j faults and failingsâ his avarice, his un-
sympathetic nature, with a heart as cold
jas the marble of the great downtown
store, as hard as the iron of the uptown
j one, where the name of Hilton is now so
| brazenly flaunted, and as barren of affec
! tion as the Hempstead Plains, where hi 3
I bones are supposed to lie beneath cathe
-1 dral archesâ he was a man of the very
j loftiest conceptions. The maker out of
! a slender capital of millions and millions
! of money, gathered aiid garnered at flrst
! by the slowest and most painful of com-
I mercial processes, screwing here and
! pinching there, he had, nevertheless, the
{ genius to do and to dare great things. The
; Grant episode is one of them. And when
j Grant, as President, gave conclusive evi
j dence of the esteem in which he held
Stewart by sending his nartie to the Sen-
ate as his Secretary* of the Treasury, the
most astonished and the most gratified
i man in all the country was Stewart him-
self. His confirmation was assured until
some ' delver in old and long-forgotten
statutes found that the act of Congress
organizing the Treasury Department stip
ulated that a man who Imported goods for
gain and barter was debarred from hold-
ing the great office. It was. a bitter blow
to A. T. Stewart.
A GREAT SACRIFICE.
There was one way and one way only
out of the difficulty that had arisen.
Stewart should give up the business with
which his name had been Identified for
more than forty years and become a re-
tired merchant. It was a tremendous sac-
rifice to make. The annual profits of the
great stores, retail and wholesale, ran
Into the millionsâ somewhere from two to
four or ten millions of that gold of which
Stewart, in his all-devouring avaricious-
ness, could never get enough. Was it un-
der the advice of Hilton that he consented
to the sacrifice and surrender of It all?
No one now can tell except Hilton him-
self, and it is very certain that the secret
will never be disclosed by him-.
The "Judge" was playing for great
stakes at that time. Whichever way he
turned there were millions in full view-
millions on which, subsequent events show
he had got his eyes, eyes more avaricious
than even those of Stewart himself.
Twenty-five or thirty- thousand dollars a
year was paid about this time to "advise"
his master, and what was the advice?
That this ambitious old man, 67 years of
age, should assign the interest of'his mil-
lions to him and accept the petty salary*
of 18000 a year as a Cabinet officer with
in the future. Robeson and Belknap and
Williams as his associates. It was a mag-
nificent play for millions on the part of
Hilton. The date was 1569. in the early
March days of that year. If fortune had
not played Henry Hilton false then he
would have been in the saddle of the
Stewart millions at a date seven year*
anterior to that on which he vaulted into
their control, after the old man's eves
had been closed forever on Cabinet "of-
fices, on coin and on cotton, on hotels
and on hosiery, on earth and all that
earth contained.
When Stewart died he left Hilton $1,000,

I explained nearly all of the Stewart mil
! lions came into Hilton's possession. He
became the owner of the store at Broad-
way and Ninth street. He changed the
firm to that of Hilton. Hughes & Den-
ning. But the money making power had
vanished with Stewart and Hilton's plans
i never prospered. The business failed
finally in 1596.
After Mrs. Stewart's death numerous
efforts were made by relatives to deprive
Hilton of the Stewart millions. All failed.
Judge Hilton had much trouble in the
last few years with some of his sons, who
were inclined to be wild.

RENEWED INTEREST IN THE
GREAT MONTEREY EXCURSION
A Fine Programme of Sports Prom-
ised by the Mayor.
Now that our citizens have somewhat
recovered from the excitement attend
ant on the magnificent demonstration
accorded to our returning California
volunteer?, the public's attention is
now being gradually manifested to
ward the great Monterey excursion
which is to take place Sunday next,
September 3.
The Southern Pacific passenger de
partment are just in receipt of a letter
from Mayor Johnson of Monterey, from
which we quote the following:
"Various committee* who have this
programme of sports in hand report
everything working well. We will have
about twelve to fifteen of the worst
'broncos' that can be found in this part
of the country and which will amuse
the people when they are saddled by
good riders. Will also have about the
same number of wild two and three
year olds. A few wild buffaloes will
also be on the ground for the bare-back
riders. Work on the grand stand will
begin Monday." y2- -'. '>.v*:
As heretofore announced the excur
sion trains will leave Third and Town-
Bend street depot at 8 o'clock a. m., and
returning will leave Monterey at 4:45
p. m. These trains will run through
â without stops, except for water and
registering.
Special excursion tickets will be
placed on sale at the Grand Hotel
ticket office on Wednesday, the 30th
Inst., and continued up to Saturday in
clusive. Tickets will be on sale at
Third street depot and Valencia street
on the morning of the excursion.
Mr. William H. Menton, excursion
passenger agent, reports a large inquiry
for these excursion tickets, the low
rate of $2 being well received.
Oakland passengers will take the
train which leaves East Oakland at 6:30
a. m. Passengers from Berkeley will
have to take the 6 a. m. train and those
from Alameda will take the local train
leaving Park street at 5:55 a. m.
It should be remembered that this is
the last excursion of the season to Del
Monte, Monterey and Pacific Grove at
the J2 rate.

SENSATION IN
PARRY CASE
IS EXPLODED
Defense Explains to
Prosecution.
Matters moved slowly in the Parry case
in Judge Graham's court yesterday after
noon. Attorney Knight and the defendant
kept the court waiting for over a half
hour but when they finally appeared
apologies were offered and accepted ami
the case went on. , Z'*'Jl
There was the promise of spicy develop
ments when Prosecuting Attorney Went
worth introduced testimony to prove that
Mrs Parry had registered at the Palace
under the name of Mrs. Corbett. Specta
tors leaned forward and there was an
awful hush in the courtroom. Then At
torney Knight, with a winning smile and
easy grace stepped to the front and with
one fell swoop smashed the sensation.
â¢'There is no necessity for all this ques
tioning," he said. "We admit Mrs. Parry |
registered at the Palace under the name
of Mrs. Corbett. 1 do not know whether
it was as Mrs. Jim. but I do know it
was done at her husband's request and
that afterward he was ejected from the
hotel because he, Mr. Frank Parry, was
'found in 'Mrs. Corbett's room.
Isaac Parry, father of the deceased,
who was put on the stand by the prose
cution proved a splendid witness for the
defence Parry told how, when he ques
tioned his son as to how he had received
his wound, he had declared it was an
a^Arenyou telling me the truth, Frank?"
he said; and Frank* repeated: "It was an
"And your boy was always truthful?"
ouestloned Knight. 'X'Z'.-.,
"My boy was habitually truthful," re
plied the witness. .... â. **,_.
Van Valkenberg. stepfather of the
defendant, was the first witness of the
afternoon. The cross-examination of this
Witness brought out no further testimony
than that which had been offered at his
direct examination. X-'-'P . _j
Mr* Van Valkenberg took the stand
after her husband and told of the peaceful
family meal that preceded the shooting
When Mrs. Van Valkenberg heard the
shot she ran toward Parry's room and
heard him cry. "Mamma, mamma, come
tome; I'm shot." When she reached the
deceased's room she found him leaning
up against a door. "How did it happen?"
said the witness to the wounded man, ana
he answered. "It was an accident.
Miss Minnie Brown, sister of Mrs.
Parry, and Miss Phemy Harrison her
cousin were both called and told in detail
the same general story as had been re
peated by the previous witnesses. They
knew nothing of a quarrel in regard to
Leo Hirschman and understood that Mr.
and Mrs. Parry' were a most loving and
devoted couple. On the night of the shoot
ing both In response to calls, went to
Parry's room, but neither questioned
either wife or husband as to the shooting.
Miss Brown's testimony developed the
fact that Mrs. Parry had gone last No
vember for a lengthy visit to a step
â¢sister in Los Angeles, but if she subse
quently went to Arizona the witness knew
nothing about It- , Â

DUKE IS ASSIGNED
TO CHINESE QUARTER
Sergeant Donovan and his squad have
been relieved from duty in Chinatown.
Yesterday Chief Lees, on account of the
temporary Illness of Donovan, decided to
withdraw the Chinatown squad. Ser
geant Duke of the O'Farrell street station
is to take his place Duke's squad will
consist of Policemen Robert Conner. John ;
Herlihy. "John Davids, John Conlan and i
Fabian Callahan.
Sergeant Donovan, notwithstanding
that he has been detailed in Chinatown
only a comparatively short time, has
made a brilliant record. Ably assisted
by Police Officers Campbell, Save, Lyons,
Hering ar.d Griffin, he succeeded In clos
ing a number of games that were con
sidered impregnable by the former squads.
In his anxiety to suppress gambling In
Chinatown .Donovan overworked himself,
and .is the result he became ill. Chief
Lees, on learning of his condition, ordered
him to stay away from the Chinese quar
ter until he became convalescent. Despite
the order of the head of the department
Donovan, evidently anxious about his
men, frequently visited Chinatown "just
to see what was going on," as he cx
i pressed it. Realizing that his impaired
i health would not allow him to continue
in his determined fight against the law
i breakers of the Chinese quarter. Chief
i Lees decided to withdraw him and his
squad.
Sergeant Duke was selected by the
Chief to take Donovan's place, and at his
j suggestion he was allowed to pick the men
c that compose his squad.
Donovan to-day leaves on a two weeks'
'. vacation. On his return he will be as
i signed to duty at the O'Farrell street sta
| tion to take the place of Sergeant Duke.

CORPORATIONS SUBJECT
TO THE STATE LAW
United States Circuit Judge Morrow yes
terday handed down an important opinion
in favor of the respondents In the suit of
Frederick Williams vs. The Gold Hill
Mining Company, George C. Gaylord,
Charles E. Maddrell and Dwight T. Rolfe.
The action "nad teen brought to fore
close a mortgage of $50,000 on one hundred
bonds of the denomination of $300 each,
issued July 1, 1860, interest payable semi
annually at the rate of 10 per cent per an
num. The mortgage was held by G. Liv
ingstone Morse of New York as trustee.
At the trial it was contended by the re
spondents that the mortgage was void for
the reason that it had been Incurred with
out a two-thirds vote of the stockholders,
as required by the laws of the State of
California. The complainants set up the
contention that the Gold Hill Mining Com
pany, being a foreign corporation, was
not bound by the laws of California. In
his opinion sustaining tiu jurisdiction of
the laws of the State over foreign cor
porations doing business within its boun
daries Judge M.ii row said:
"The personnel and the Internal man
agement of foreign corporations are sub
ject to the laws of the State In which
they are organized, and by virtue of
which they are entitled to exist as cor
porations. But when such foreign cor
porations come to do business in Califor
nia they are restrained by the public pol
icy of the State from the enjoyment of
privileges not participated In by the do
mestic corporations organized under and
existing by virtue of the laws of this
State."
The opinion goes on to say that the laws
of the State prescribe that mortgages
must be ratified by a two-thirds vote of
the stockholders, and the mortgage upon
which the cause of action was based not
having been so ratified is Invalid.

The Coroner's jury that heard the testi
mony at the inquest yesterday morning
upon the bodies of Deputy Sheriff James
B. Brown and Mrs. Fannie Barnes re
turned a verdict charging George Tanner
with murder in the first degree. Coroner
Hill disapproved of the verdict, and upon
his instructing the jury that a verdict of
murder was all that was necessary under
"Crowner's Quest" law, -the verdict was
changed to that of murder.
Tanner was present at the inquest,
guarded by Detective Dillon. Ke de
clined to make any statement. He is a
short, thickset man and looks every inch
the sailor with his grizzled beard and
brown skin.
The first witness was Louis Mill, pro
prietor of the St. Malo lodging house, in
which the shooting was done. He swore
that Tanner was drinking heavily last
Saturday and that he had had an alter-
cation with Brown downtown, and that
Brown had slapped his face. When Tan-
ncr saw Mrs. Barries in the hallway he
called her a vile name and she struck
him across the face with a towel that
was hanging to dry upon the banisters.
Tanner demanded of the witness the re-
volver which he had given to him two
months before for safe keeping, l.pon
Tanner producing a permit to carry a
| pistol Mill gave him the weapon.
Tanner came back about half past 4
o'clock in the afternoon and went to his
room, where he took off his coat and
1 then walked up and down the hallway In
' his shirt sleeves in front of the rooms
occupied by his victims, cursing them.
! Shortly after 5 o'clock Brown and Mrs.
! Barnes came in. and the witness called
! Brown Into his offlce and told him that
Tanner had a pistol in his pocket and
was going to kill Brown and Mrs. Barnes.
Brown asked what for. and then said that
it was all right. Brown and the woman
went to their room and Tanner began
calling them names. Tanner said that If
: Brown would step out into the back yard
'â  he would show him what the matter was.
Both came out of their rooms, and Brown
asked Tanner whether he wanted to fight
him. to which Tanner replied: "O. no;
1 don't want to fight you." Then Tan
ner shoved Brown and Brown caught hold
of Tanner, and a. scuffle followed. Tan
ner was thrown to the floor, and the
witness seized Tanner's hand to pre
vent him drawing his revolver. Brown
drew his pistol, held it by the handle and
i threatened to strike Tanner if he did not
desist Then Brown handed a bunch of
keys to Mill and requested him to open
1 the police box and summon the police.
Mill ran to the box, but could not open
1 it and when he was returning he heard
shots and his wife came .to the head of
the stairs and Informed him that Brown
: was dead. He saw Brown and the woman
: lying on their backs in the hallway,
dead. , Â.. ... ...
When the police came Mill told them.
When the police came Mill told them.
I that Tanner was a murderer and had
i killed two persona In his house. Tanner
was sitting on the side of his bed and
remarked: "Oh, that's nothing.
Mrs Marie Mill, wife of th.- preceding
witness, corroborated her husband's tes
tlmonv She saw Tanner shoot at Brown
twice" and when Brown fell to the floor
she threw herself upon his body and did
what she could for him. because she
i liked Mr. Brown and the rest of her
lodgers very much. .iwv
John Lambert, driver of a wagon for
Hobbs & Wall, saw Tanner knock at
Brown's door and heard him call Brown
a vile name and say: "Come out here
' and I'll do you up.'; When Tanner and
; Brown came together Brown drew a re-
I volver, caught it by the barrel in the
i manner of a club, and said: I 11 kill
I you " Brown had one arm around Tan
. ner's neck. After Brown got Tanner down
on the floor Brown gave the witness a
bunch of key's and requested him to go
to the parted box and summon the police.
When the witness returned Brown was
dead. _ ,
Charles Thurston saw Tanner draw a
revolver from his waistband and shoot
Brown. Mrs. Barnes came running
through the hall screaming. Tanner
turned and shot her. and fired another
shot at Brown after he had fallen.
William Phillips, the next witness, was
not a witness to the shooting, but after
Tanner's arrest the witness asked Tan
ner why he had killed Brown and Mrs.
Barnes." and Tanner replied: "1 had to
Mrs Phillips, wife of the preceding wit
ness had a talk with Tanner at about
half 'past 2 o'clock in the afternoon, and
took "just one drink" with Tanner out of
a quart bottle of whisky that Tanner had.
He was under the Influence of liquor and
told her that he had been to the jail to
see Brown and to inform him of Mrs.
Barnes' conduct, he having heard that
the woman had been In a back room of
the Hoffman saloon with some man or
men. He and Brown went to the Hoff
man that night to watch for her in case
she should go there again.
When Brown and the woman came
I home, a short time before the tragedy,
I Brown spoke of having struck Tanner In
the face when they had met downtown.
Mrs Barnes also spoke of the trouble
she had had that -morning with Tanner,
when she slapped his face.
At tho time of the shooting Mrs. Phil
lips was ln her room and did not see the
Robert Whittle, detective, testified that
when he arrested Tanner immediately
after the murder Tanner was drunk, and
said that he did the killing in self-de
fense. Tanner seemed to be sorry He
was not so drunk that he didn't know
i what he was doing.
The prisoner was taken before Police
I Judge Conlan and was instructed as to
his rights. His preliminary examination
was set for September 1.

EASTERN MARKETS
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Aug. 28.â There was a marked
falling off of interest in railroad stocks to-
day compared with that prevailing last week.
Interest shifted Into the Industrial specialties.
and a number of these were marked up in a
feverish and Irregular manner. The genera]
list was maintained with difficulty and a slight
flurry in call money in the last hour carried
prices, with the few exceptions of strength, p
below last night's level. In the final harden-
ing movement on covering by shorts, some of
*
the specialties' and a few obscure railroad
stocks rose to t'.p level. This made the clos-
ing of the market linn. but the majority of
standard stocks show net losses. An influ
ential factor In tlic hesitating and doubtful
tune and speculation was the renewed anxiety
ever the meney market outlook caused by Sat-
urday's bank statement; Call money was quite
stiffly held at 3 per cent all day and was
marked above that in the last hour, possibly
not Without manipulation. But the fact re-
mains that the present low stage of surplus
reserves of he New York Clearing House banks
keeps the financial world keenly observant and
in a somewhat uneasy frame of mind. Pro-
fessions pf confidence that the West is amply
provided with funds to nance the coming crop
movement without calling Oil New York, do
not altogether avail in the face of tie- con-
dition of the local banks. Neither does the
Hucgestion that the Peal companies have large
available funds which do not figure in clearing
liouse banking reserves, though both of these
explanations liave undoubted force. The buy-
ing for London account, which has served to
sustain some stocks recently, was missed. There
were upward movements of importance to-day
in the Tobacco stocks, Manhattan, Metropoli-
tan. Steel; Rail was, -Sugar and some of ill"
In en and steel stexks. the latter under the in-
fluence of a declaration < .f the first dividend on
the Republic Steel preferred of 1% per cent.
called quarterly. American Express jumped 10
points over Saturday's, price. On the other j
hand there was a weakness in International j
Paper, Cotorado Fuel. Brooklyn Transit, Ten- |
nessee Coal and a few other specialties. In the j
railway list the only stocks to stiow any marked
demand were Southern Railway preferred and
Kansas and Texas preferred.
Kansas and Texas seconds are 3% higher on
the day. Otherwise there was no notable feat-
ure in "th<: bond market. Total sales, par value,
12.42re.000.

Chicago Grain Market.
[ CHICAGO. Aug. 28.â For a good part of the
morning wheat was firm at a slight advance in
prices. Liverpool showed hut a small opening
decline and more than recovered this before
the close there. A more important considera
j tion was the Â«mall world's shipments and more
\ particularly those from Russia, whose large
exports last week were an important factor in
causing a downward turn to the market. Rus
sia this week reported shipments of 499.000
bushels, the total world's shipments being
5.739,000 bushels. Northwest receipts were
somewhat larger, but not enough so to bear-
lshly affect the market. Shorts were the best
buyers at the opening . Northwest and other
outside markets were weaker than this and
some pressure was put on the market by pro
fessionals and elevator people for this reason,
which caused a temporary decline. September
opened %c to %c higher at 79% c, and declined
to 70% c. December opened V' to %c higher at I
72%Cg7;'c, an.! eased off to 72%372%c. The de- I
cline was stopped by the statement that the !
visible supply had decreased 1,517,000 bushels, !
and the slackening in the selling pressure com- j
ing at a. time when shorts were covering, prices !
advanced again. September getting to 70%671c
and December to 73c. These proved the high
points of the day. A period of _ comparative
Inactivity followed, but before noon the market
turned decidedly weak on the reported arrival
of 300 cars of new wheat at Duluth and by *
much more favorable thrashing returns from
the Northwest. Elevator people and profes- I
sional bears were not slow to take advantage I
of this and pounded the market persistently c
from then until the end of the session. De- ;
cember declined to 71% c and September to 70c. j
There was a tendency on the parts of shorts j
to cover at those figures and a slight rally
occurred, but the general feeling was weak
to the close. The seaboard reported a . large
export business in the break, but the cash
market was i>oor. September closed at 70Â®
70%e. and December at 72c bid.
Corn was weak for September, but steady for j
December and May. Crip reports continued \
favorable. September closed %c lower, De- :
cember closed %c lower. The speculative mar- |
ket for oats was almost at a standstill. Sep- 1
tember closed unchanged; December closed %c j
lower. â â¢â¢'
The market for provisions was firm but dull. j
Receipts of hogs were moderate and large de- 1
creases in stocks were reported, particularly I
of ribs, which led the firmness in the specula- ',
tive market. Packers were good buyers of lard
and ribs. At the close September pork was
unchanged, lard and ribs 7%c higher.

Hay and Feedstuff s.
Receipts of Hay were 1299 tons. The market
was naturally weak, but the demand was fair
and prices showed no further decline. The cir
cular of George Morrow *& Co. says: "The
market Is duller than it has been for a long
time. The average yearly receipts from all
sources do not exceed 120,000 tons. During the
past four weeks we have received at this point
18.172 tons or three-tenths of the year's supply.
Or putting It In another way we have received
in one month almost two months' supply of
hay Not only this but the worst ts yet to
come. We do not say this because we are
alarmists or have the slightest desire to de
press the market, but simply because lt
stands to reason that the early rains may very
shortly be expected and there will be a very
natural desire to get the hay out of the fields
as soon as possible. Even as It is, if schoon
ers were not so very scarce, the receipts would
be far in excess of what they are now. It
would seem to be good policy to either store
or else ship to market as soon as possible."

Special Dispatch to The Call.
WOODLAND, Aug. 28.- The late Walter
Root was committed to the Agnews Asy
lum for the Insane last December. He
died on Friday. August 25. The news of
lits death came as a complete surprise to
his relatives and friends, as a letter had
been received a few days prior to the'an
nouncement containing Information to the
effect that he was improving, both men
tally and physically.
The body was brought to Woodland last
Friday evening, and all those who viewed
it expressed surprise and indignation at
its condition, which plainly Indicated
neglect and lack of attention upon the
part of somebady at the asylum.
The muscles and ligaments, as well as
the soft tissues of the left elbow, were
broken, and the elbow Joint showed indi
cations of having been wrenched apart.
There was nothing bout the Joint but a
plain cotton bandage.

ceased, informed a Call representative
that Dr. Dillon, another brother-in-law,
made an examination which disclosed the
fact that two ribs had recently been
broken on the left side of the body, but
had so knitted that the injury "could
scarcely be noticed upon a superficial ex
amination.
The features were distorted, the mouth I
and eyes open and the expression of the I
face indicated that the prisoner died dur- i
ing violent exertion. As the insanity of
the patient during most "1" his confinement
was of a violent form it is possible, and !
even probable, that these evidences of vio- j
lence were self-inflicted, but it seems as- ;
rounding that no effort was made to close
the eyes and mouth and that the body
was shipped away from the asylum in a I
. â¢ p.dition indicating brutal neglect.
The relatives of the deceased and mem
bers of the Masonic fraternity are so |
worked up over the matter that there is |
some talk of demanding an investigation. I

Clay Clement in His
Old Success.
-'Â : â â  â * ...-'*: . -
Comparison of "The New Dominion"
with "A Southern Gentleman" sets one
i thinkingâ and the thought hangs a por-
tent. What direction did criticism of the
former take last year that Mr. Clement
! should, have selected the qualities least
admirable in it. and in the latter enlarge
I upon them so as to bend and hinder his
work as a dramatist? I mean the tend-
ency to wordiness, to long speeches and
the introduction of the vocabulary and
\ subject matter of verse. The speech about
j the human flower is excellent â most in-
teresting, but it has no dramatic value.
and this sort of thing is pushed to the
limit in "A Southern Gentleman." It is
the stuff out of which one makes wooden
passionless plays. Over-thought for pret-
tiness Induces nausea, and while a play
j may get along perfectly without esthetic
qualities, lameness of action, lack of
i honest appeal to human emotion, will In
! evitably weaken it. Provided it be not
i grewsome. considerable downright blunt
I ugliness is a good dramatic qualityâ it is
j so human. If Mr. Clement means to keep
on spreading this veneer so generously he
! will ultimately cover his strength and
I present only the insipidâ the colorless.
The South seems to be the Mecca of all
1 v.ho would write character plays and
] catch that Intangible something called
i "atmosphere" of wonderful value, be-
cause see elusiveâ elusive as the Zeit-Gelst.
The theme is over-handled, the subject
: about threshed to the limit, and yet Mr.
Clement has given us in "Tin New Do-
minion" a play of quiet, even interest,
i subdued in situation, natural in key,
witty in dialogue, carrying its strength
not so much in -its plot, which is not novel
; (the "Old Homestead" mortgage Idea),
as in its well-drawn characters, chief of
which are Hohenstauffen and Marshall
Boner and Martha. Hohenstauffen Is a
CrOSS between a type and an eccentric,
but with a comfortable leaning toward
the former. He Is a slightly exaggerated
composite of a large German class, but
done with as thorough a knowledge of
values as a Nicholson portrait or a Phil
May sketch, and it would be a caviling
critic who would not tell Mr. Clement
that he has cleverly drawn a most Inter-
esting character, and acted it to the life.
Not -a cloud hangs over his German dia
lect and the insight with which he ap
preciates his own Idiomatic breaks is
quite as humorous as the breaks them-
selves. The substratum of the hard, un
! flinching Teuton, eve:* visible through the
surface polish, is a bit of ballast that
moors the Baron Franz Victor securely
to this earth. Otherwise one might
vaguely fancy that heaven was his only
worthy home. Marshall Boner is not a
unique species of brute. He is the old
story of the double inheritanceâ money
and an injudicious palate In whisk
and is portrayed by Mr. Jeffrey Williams
with thoroughly hateful, convincing
strength. He is to be congratulated on
his choice of cravat so., potent a thine
in revealing a man's breedingâ it stamped
the vulgarity of his character at onco.
Of the others, save Miss O'Malley as
Martha and Mr. O'Malley as Napoleon,
the negro, one would like to write a
colorless paragraph committing himself
to nothing, for one's thoughts in regard
! to them are neutralized between satisfac
j tion and the opposite. They do not mar,
| neither do they enhance the value of the
play. Hohenstauffen alone is well worth
i spending an evening with.

Tivoli.
Ponchielli being one of the modern mas-
Ponchlelll being one of the modern mas-
ters, "La Glaconda" Is replete with that
Intense passion which makes dramatic
singing such a grateful task. Consider-
ing; the fact that last night's performance
at the Tivoli was a first night, and but
scanty preparation could be made for its
production, it must be admitted that It
was beyond doubt a creditable perform- '
ance. Of course, Avedano. as usual, re-
ceived the largest share of the applause,
which he endeavored to earn by consci
entious work. As to the excellent quality
of his robust tenor there is no denial, but
as to the quality of his deportment much
adverse criticism could be jotted down.'
The title role was in the hands of Anna
Lichter, where it fared very well. "Many
remarks were made as to the poor method
of Miss Lichter's singing, it is a great
mistake to assume that this vocalist's
method is faulty. On the contrary, she
sings as true as steel, and never fails to
strike the correct note. She may be af
flicted with a slight vibrato, but in this
she does not stand alone. The fact is that
Miss Lichter is a conscientious worker
and an Industrious vocalist, upon whom
the management may depend at all times,
and this s Imuch more than '.in be said of
other, more "illustrious" members of the
company.
William Mertena was obliged to study
the English libretto of Barnaba at two
hours' notice, owing to the sudden indis-
position of Salassa. This is the second
time Salassa became suddenly indisposed,
much to the discomfort of the manage-
ment. Sickness is sometimes convenient
to serve as an excuse for appearing two
nights in succession. None of the other
singers are afflicted in this manner. Mr.
Mertens deserves great credit for his gen-
erosity and also for his quick study. Sure-
ly his work last night did not exhibit any
signs of a hurried preparation.
ALFRED MKTZGER.
Grand Opera-House.
There is a good deal of horseplay in
Planquette's comic opera "Paul Jones,"
and Wolff and Wc.oley make the most of
It. Wolff has. not much singing to do in
| his role, and the more's the pity, but he
kept the large audience In good humor
last night. Persse was an interesting Paul
Jones and gained the sympathy of the
! audience from the start He and his sweet
heart, Yvonne, Edith Mason, have some
pretty duets, which prove to be encore
: provokers.
Alcazar.
"Ingomar" was presented at the Alca
! zar last night for the closing week of the
i successful engagement of Miss Florence
. Roberts. It was her first appearance in
I the character of Parthenia, and taken al-
I together her Interpretation was a credita
ble one. but she has been seen to better
advantage in other parts. The play seemed
to drag for the first three acts, and a
large number of the audience seemed to
imagine that they were seeing a comedy,
; but In the last two acts all this was
changed, and Miss Roberts and White
: Whittlesey, who made a capable Ingomar,
were repeatedly called before the curtain.
Chutes.
Adgie. the lion tamer, who created a
sensation here two years ago, reappeared
at the Chutes Theater last night in a
startling act. She came on the stage in
street ccstume and after tossing her para*
sol into the wings jumped Into the den of
lions, took off a Gainsborough hat, passed
it to a maid and gradually undressed.
When she was Anally reduced to the garb
of a circus performer she put Prince,
Victoria and Trilby through most ter
rific paces.
Olympia.
The programme at the Olympia this
week Is good. Zoa Matthews continues to
be popular and Reina Vinton's singing is
one of the most attractive features of the
show. Blanche Sloan St. Clair is playing
th' last week of a very successful engage-
ment. The rest of the bill is good.
Orpheum.
At the O'Farrell-streot vaudeville liouse
At the O'Farrell-street vaudeville house
there are two tiny debutantes in the vau
deville world who are bound to create a
sensationâ Master Arnold Grazer and La
Petite Hazel. Both the children have
done "turns" before and have been "feat-
ures" of holiday attractions.' Master Ar
nold has a Tivoli reputation back of him
and Hazel has been the precocious babe
of many a production. The children's act
at the Orpheum is one that is going to
attract on account of its novelty, artistic
beauty and the rare talent of the dimin
utive performers.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, AUGUST 29, 1899.
TAX LEVY IS
MAINTAINED BY
SUPERVISORS
Dollar Limit Not Sent
Skyward.
Yesterday's meeting of the Board of
Supervisors was productive of something
considerable in the line of surprises; it
was a day for the short-enders; the tal
ent is still guessing. None of the unex
pected things transpired without a
wrangle; the Republican majority had all
it could do to block the persistent at-
tempts of the Democratic minority to
make Democratic politics out of about
every situation that presented itself ani
a good bit of heated discussion was the
I result of it all. i.yP
Mayor Phelan started matters off nicely
by descending from his accustomed alti
tude and. acknowledging that he had got
off decidedly wrong in his tax levy fig-
ures; then Supervisor Ferrault's motion
to reconsider the vote whereby the tax
levy was reconsidered was carried, and
, then Supervisor Deasy flopped again; he
i reconsidered the motion he made last
week to break into the dollar limit for
i the benefit of the Sixth street sewer and
thereafter voted against any proposition
that might lead to an abrogation of the
tax levy as established by the Finance
Committee.
Incidental to the other startling devel
opments of the day the gas company sent
[in Attorney Thomas B. Bishop .say that
Mr. Crockett and the rest of them would
hereafter keep within the provisions of
the one-twelfth act and render bills for
lighting accordingly; but the tax levy was
the one prominent feature of the meeting.
A goodly audience had gathered in the
chambers to see the levy inflated and
started skyward by those who had made
it, but it failed to go up despite the earn-
est efforts of Mayor Phelan, and the audi-
ence went to the door to demand its
money back.
The first order of business was Per-
rault's motion to reconsider, but before
demanding it he moved that when the
board adjourned it do so to September 18.
His motion was seconded by Holland and
carried with only a couple of dissenting
votes. Then he called up his motion for
reconsideration, and no debate ensuing
Clerk Kusseli opened up with the roll-call.
Aigeltinger, Attridge, Black and BJ-ing-
ton all voted to reconsider and the votft
was up to Collins when it struck Mayor
Phelan that the/board had decided not to
break through the limit* after all and see-
Ing a clever bit of Democratic politics be-
ing voted out of his hands he immediately
interrupted the roll.
< "The members of this board do not seem
to know what they are voting for," ex-
claimed he, and then he hastily attempt-
ed to explain the motion. Supervisor
Ferrault Jumped to his feet and demanded
the rollcall proceed from Collins on, and
said that Mayor phelan had no right to
Interrupt a rollcall for political or any
other purposes. The Mayor murmured
his customary excuses and ordered the
rollcall to proceed, and the motion was
carried by a vote of Bto 4. Then Perrault
moved to lay the original motion to re-
consider on the table, and that motion
also was carried. Aigeltinger, Attridge
and Collins voting no.
With this last indorsement of the dollar
limit Supervisor Deasy's Sixth-street
sewer hopes went a glimmering. It was
in order to have the street fund increased
$10,000 for vote-making purposes south of
Sixth street that he made the original
motion to bolt the pledge and the main-
tenance of the levy knocked that game
in the head The board, however, was
met uncharitable and offered him consola
tion in the shape of a gold brick resolu
tion which provided that the Street De-
partment fund be increased $10,000 to be
used for the specific purpose of repair-
ing the Sixth-street sewer. It was point-
ed OUt that as the tax levy question had
been disposed of that action could pot be
taken, so the board adopted only the last
two paragraphs of the resolution, which
read as follows:
Resolved. That the City Engineer is hereby
required to make all necessary examinations
and report to the Superintendent of Streets the
condition '.f the sewer in Sixth street, between
Folsom and Harrison, and connecting sewers
requiring reconstruction, as heretofore ordered.
Resolved, That the Superintendent of Streets
be and he hereby is empowered and required to
proceed forthwith and make provision for re
constructing said sewers, ,to abate the nuisance
now existing.
Perrault questioned that Auditor Wells
would audit bills for the work if they ex
ceeded the one-twelfth act, and moved
that in be called in consultation. When
asked he said he would strain a point in
favor of the Sixth-street sewer, as he
considered the imjrrovement a matter of
emergency and one demanded by the
whole people In the district affected.
By a resolution Introduced by Super
visor Holland Architects Shea & Shea
were Instructed to take possession of the
Hall of Justice for the city if Bateman
Bros., the contractors, shall not have
finished the structure by September 1.
The resolution further provided that
Bateman Bros, should be lined 15000 as a
penalty tor non-fulfillment of their con
tract, and that the "building shall be
completed by the city out of funds as yet
unpaid tec the contractors. The resolution
was adopted, Black and Phelps voting
no. As Bateman Bros, acknowledge they
cannot. finish their work by the appointed
date,, the Hall of Justice will be taken
into the hands of the city on September 2.
Although the tax levy had been dis
posed of. President Bergerot of the
Board of Education, with two black
boards, and Superintendent Webster
broke in at this point to argue for a
larger appropriation for his department.
President Bergerot was also accompanied
by several misstatements of considerable
magnitude, which he offered the board as
solid fact. He said in opening that the
average salary of the school teacher in
San Francisco was $â¢", per month, and in
doing so he ignored the fact that the
books of ids department show that the
average salary is $78 per month with a
couple of months' vacation thrown in. He
said also that the last Legislature passed
a law which provided that a teachers'
salary . fund should be created and that
the amount expended for teachers' sal
aries during one year should be the figure
upon which the fund of the succeeding
year should be based. Mr. Bergerot said
that this amount this year should be
(1,088,640, but he neglected to say that in
that figure he had not only Included
teachers' salaries but janitors' pay, oflice
and shop salaries and rents as well, all
of which the law of th." !ast Legislature
did not lake into consideration nor pro
vide for. :V
- Bergerot also said that the same
law provided that if the Supervisors
should not establish such a fund and fix
this figure, as specified, the Auditor him
self should add it to the tax levy. He
told the same thing to Auditor Wells
earlier in the afternoon, and Mr. Wells
smilingly denied the constitutionality of
the alleged law and declared his intention
of ignoring it. The Auditor said that in
creating the teachers' fund the Legisla
ture was establishing a class of preferred
creditors against the School Department,
and that the constitution did not acknowl
edge such a class. He further said that no
law in the land gave him the power to in
any way alter the tax levy as fixed by
the Supervisors, and that until there was
a law he would not do so. Despite the
Auditor's decision Mr. Bergerot handed
all of these points out to the board in
support of his effort to break into the
limit, and when he had finished Mayor
Phelan came to his support with the
statement that he had discovered that in
presenting the figures upon which the
board had fixed the School Department
appropriation he had been guilty of a mis
calculation. He asked permission of the
board to present another estimate, and
Supervisor Perrault got up to say that on
behalf of the board he would agree to
adopt any figures the Mayor might sug
gest. ' *â  *â â 
"Why do you not move to adopt any tax
levy I may suggest?" asked Mayor Phe
lan.
"I make that motion," promptly retort
ed Perrault, but when it came to a vote
no one cared to take the chance, and the
motion failed of adoption.
Supervisor Black's resolution to repeal
the anti-pool selling order next came up,
and, as was stated would be the case in
yesterday morning's Call, further action
upon it was indefinitely postponed. .
â¢Adjournment was taken after the unan
imous adoption of the following patriotic

visor Holland: * â¢â - --**.' â â -â¢"â¢â â¢â

Linked.
SAN RAFAEL, Aug. 28.â The dove of
peace seems to have at last perched over
the house of the Danlells and the Hast
ings , and with the chronicling of the
event is written the final chapter of a case
of domestic infelicity, celebrated in Amer
ica and Europe on account of the prom
inence and social position of the principals
and the wealth of their families. Mrs.
James Daniells and her husband have evi
dently determined to carve out their own
fate in the future, despite the protests of
relatives.
The titled descendant of a family re
lated to the celebrated Beau Brummel and
his" wife were in a happy mood to-night,
' and marched through the corridors of the
! Hotel Rafael arm in arm, with Mrs. Dan-
iells' two little children clinging to them
ami prattling in childish glee.
Mrs. Daniells was formerly Miss Mamie
Coghlll, and her marriage to Robert Hast
ings was a celebrated event in the social
world. At his death she and their two
children inherited a large fortune. She
afterward married. James Daniells. and
went to London to reside. She was' there
seven years when tales of domestic strife
became whispered about. Early last spring
Mrs. Daniells returned to San Francisco
and stayed .at the Palace Hotel until
a few months ago. when she took up her
residence at the Hotel Rafael. Many tales
were told of her separation from her hus
band, one being that the relatives of both
parties were dissatisfied with the mar-
riage, and another being that the wife of
the Rev. Dr. Hemphill, the children's ma
ternal grandmother, discovered that Dan-
iells had squandered his wife's inherit
ance and was using that of her grand
children, a condition of affairs which
caused her to have the children brought
back here.

NEW POSTAL ORDERS.
The Postmaster General has advised
Postmaster Montague of the adoption of
a new form of postal money order which
will be introduced gradually as the sup
ply of the old forms become exhausted
after September 4. .;--
The new order will be about the size of
an ordinary bank draft. The advice or
notification to be sent by the issuing to
the paying Postmaster is a reproduction
of the order through the use of carbonized
paper (the manifold process) and a receipt
for the amount will be furnished to the
remitter by the issuing paymaster. ,
By the carbon process the order and
advice are produced simultaneously. By
the same operation the essential particu
lars of name of payee, date, amount and
place of payment as written In the order
are duplicated. The liability to error is
lessened and absolute uniformity in
insured between the order and advice.

PASTOR PLAYS THE
PART OF PEACEMAKER
OAKLAND, -Aug. 28.â Miss Jane Hodge
had bought* her new bonnet, her tailor-
made dress and all the accompanying
articles that go to make up a bridal
trousseau when John Nieholl, the aged
capitalist, told her "it is all off."
The testimony that is gradually coming
out in this case breathes very strongly .
of a little plotting here and there to re- j
lieve the ordinary romance of love-mak- j
ing. In her deposition, which has just
j been taken. Miss Hodge told Mr. Nicholl's
! attorney, A. J.- Mhoon. of all her prepa
! rations for her marriage. The hat was
I ordered in Oakland, the tailor-made dress
i was created in San Francisco, and many
I other articles were procured in various ;
I places as the lady happened to see them j
i when completing her wedding outfit.
! The rides she took with her aged lover .
1 also occupied a large part of Miss Hodge's j
: time while giving Tier deposition. It was j
during one of these rides that Mr. Nieholl
| ventured to put his arm around the lady's ;
; waist and to murmur sweet words, which :
i have since laid the basis for this inter- |
esting damage suit. December 10 of last '
! year was a very interesting time in Miss ;
I Hodge's life. On that day she was at
I home with her aunt when Mr. Nieholl '
I drove to the house. In a spirit of fun j
Miss Hodge said to aunt: "Why don't j
\ you go driving with Mr. Nieholl?" to |
i which the aunt replied: "Go on, you silly :
' thing. You know he has come for you. j
Go and put on your wraps." "Yes. go |
'-. and put on your wraps," said Mr. Nieholl. '
I Then followed the ride, and from all that
j can be learned the very Interesting cere-
mony of poppU.g the question was re-
peated.
Attorney Mhoon was very anxious to i
obtain from the lady her opinion as to
what this attention on the part of Mr. j
Nieholl might mean, his attentions, being
apparently to make it appear that the
relationship was more like that of father
and child than of lovers. The lady quick- :
1 lv disabused the attorney's mind, and left !
j on record a very clear impression as to i
i how she interpreted Mr. Nicholl's attitude j
j and words. '
Mr. Nieholl wrote to Miss Hodge quite
1 a long letter, and it contains evidence :
'. that there was a promise of marriage and c
that it had a string to it. Mr. Nieholl in j
i this letter says: "You remembei that we i
! were to be married if my daughters did
not object to having a new mamma. Now
! they have objected, and of course, as you
' say, the marriage is all off, and I hope
our friendly relations will be the same as |
I they ever were."
Since the suit commenced a minister
has entered on the scene. Rev. Dr. Curry
of the Temescal Presbyterian Church, who ,
i used to be the pastor of a church for- i
! merly attended by the Nieholl family, â 
i called on Miss Hodge to make a pastoral :
visit. Miss Hodge was rather surprised â .
1 and does not quite understand why a min
ister who is not her pastor should come '
'to talk to her about her love affair. Dr.
1 Curry expatiated to Miss Hodge about
the beautiful spirit shown by the Savior
when he forgave his enemies Â»nd how
'â â  noble it was to forgive our enemies. He
referred to the trouble "in the family" ;
. which had been brought about, as he in
timated, by Miss Hodge. When he got
thus far the lady took issue with her
reverend visitor and told him that she
had no enemies; that Mr. Nieholl and his
daughters had never asked her to forgive
them, and wound up by telling Rev. Dr.
Curry that the Nieholl family had brought
about all the trouble by denying her en- j
gagement with John Nieholl and by rush
: ing after the reporters and giving the de
tails of the incident in the newspapers.
Miss Hodge says that she supposed Dr.
Curry called on her in a religious way, :
1 but she is strongly of the opinion that
there was also another motive to his visit.
She declares, however, that she resented :
i the Interferences of any third party ex- j
cept attorneys between her and Mr.
Nieholl and that the minister went away |
: without obtaining from her any inside
secrets relating to her dealings with Mr.
! Nieholl.
Miss Jane Hodge Is very anxious for
I the trial to be commenced. She says she
I would not have brought such action ex
cept for the purpose of establishing her
character. Several times hints have been j
' thrown out, she declares, by the Nieholl
family that she is somewhat of an ad
venturess or else losing her reason. These
insinuations she indignantly resents and
refers to the fact that she has been known
' to the Nieholl family for forty years and
i that therefore there can be no foundation
! for the suggestion that she is either a
schemer or crazy.
The completed deposition will be read
over by Miss Hodge and signed next
Wednesday.

Young Jackson has been residing with
his' mother at Seminary Park. His father,
D. Jackson, is the owner of the old Half
way House on the County road, and ls
traveling in the East as a liquor drummer
at present. Lately young Jackson lias
been working at the cannery in San Le
andro and it is supposed that -the irksome
labors deranged his mind. He began
showing symptoms of a falling mind last
Saturday and these grew more pro
nounced yesterday and to-day, until he
lost all control of himself. East night he
arose in his nightclothes and climbed up
to a windmill to stop it. In his vagaries
of fright over imagined impending dan
gers he grabbed his aged mother this
morning and refused to let go. Neighbors
were summoned, but all attempts to
break the maniac's grasp proved futile.
The mother's earnest and piteous plead
ings were idly spent on deaf ears, and
finally Sheriff Rogers was notified.
Through some ruse Deputy Sheriffs
Striker and Wales eventually induced
young Jackson to accompany his mother
to the carriage that awaited his transpor
tation, and as soon as he stepped into the
vehicle the deputies overpowered him.

FELL FROM A HIGH ROOF
TO INSTANT DEATH
Oakland Offlce San Francisco Call

Abe Leach, a shingler, fell from the roof
Abe Leach, a shingler, fell from the roof
of the Newland House this morning and
was killed. In his fall he struck the edge
of the roof of a building lower than the
one on which he was working and was

Leach was working on the roof of the
Newland Ilouse at Seventh and Washing-
Newland House at Seventh and Washing
ton streets. He was carrying a bundle of
shingles and failed to notice the tele
shingles and failed to notice the tele
phone wires attached to the roof at the
very edge of the building. His foot
caught in the wire, he lost his balance
and fell. His head struck the metal cov
ering of the roof beneath and this de
flected his fall, throwing his legs through
a window of the saloon beneath as he
turned over in reaching the sidewalk.
John Morgan was the only witness to
his companion's death. He said Leach
was just four feet away from him, carry
ing a bundle of shingles from the top of
the ladder to the place where he (Leach)
was at work. Morgan turned around just
in time to see Leach's foot caught by the
wire, and a second later he heard him
striking below. He says the man uttered
no sound and that the accident was all
over in an instant.
Contractor Howling was working with
the men on the roof and had just spoken
to Leach. A moment later he heard, a
crash and on looking around missed the
shingler, when Morgan exclaimed, "He is
gone." Contractor Dowling says Leach
had worked for him for twenty years and
was a very good workman. About ten
years ago his wife lost her reason and
attempted to murder him. She is now in
an asylum, and Leach was frequently
very melancholy over her misfortune.
The dead man has no relatives so far
as known and his remains were taken to
the Morgue.

ser to-day entered vigoroifs objections to
the granting of the petition of her son,
Charles J Krytser, wherein the latter
asks to be' appointed guardian of the per
son and estate of his father, John Kryt-
Mrs Krytser denies that the mind of her
husband has become Impaired from the
! effects of ill health or at all, or that he
has ever been incapable of, taking care of
; himself. She denies also that the son is
the only relative residing in this county,
' and avers that she herself had been ter

I proper person to be appointed guardian,
i and that his sole purpose in filing the

i use and benefit of the father's property.
! Hence she asks the petition be denied.
A lively contest is expected when the
! matter comes up for hearing, since the
son claims his purpose to be to recover
valuable property his father deeded to
I the mother while he was sick and infirm.

VOLUNTEERS WILL BE
WELL PROVIDED FOR
Employment Committee Under-
takes Practical Work.
Over Forty Thousand Dollars Will Be
Applied to the Care of Sick and
Needy- Boston Goes to Mare
Island at Once.
NOW that the glamor and the. glare.
the hurrahing and the exuberance
of the welcome to the soldiers have
passed away the members of ' the
committees that represented the people
of the State in the celebration are getting
their heads together and closing up their
accounts. The balances will be struck
to-day at meetings of the executive and
finance committees. It is estimated that
the people have contributed about $65,000
in round figures for the reception and
care of the returned soldiers. The ex
penses of the celebration approximate
$22,000, which will leave a balance exceed-
ing $40,000 to be applied to alleviating the
sufferings of the sick and succoring the
deserving destitute and needy.
With the passing of the committees that
raised the fnuds and arranged the wel
come the work of the committee that has
undertaken the task of securing employr
ment for the volunteeers fairly begins.
The members are working with a will,
appreciating that theirs is the practical
portion of the whole affair.
Rabbi Voorsangor, who is the chairman
of the committee, is devoting much of his
time to the undertaking and is enthusi
astic ln the work. He is on hand at the
headquarters tent every afternoon, plan-
ning the committee's campaign and lend-
ing what aid he possibly can to the sol-
dier applicants for work.
The committee met yesterday afternoon
and had as its guests Mrs. A. S. Towns-
end and Miss Rattlgan. Rabbi Vexjrsan-
ger introduced Mrs. Townsend to the
committeemen as the "soldiers' fairy ;
godmother." Sho believes that the com-.
mittee's work is the most practical of any
that has been undertaken in the Interests
of the soldiers and volunteered her finan
cial assistance if it was needed.
Many encouraging reports were received j
and from indications there will be no
difficulty In securing employment for
every member of the California Regiment '
who wants to work. C. E. Whitney & Co.,
wholesalers, Bent notification that several
of their men left their employ to enter
the service of their country and thai .as
Boon as they are mustered out they could
return to their old positions.
J. D. Smith of Livermore advised the j
committee that his section of the country
-could supply employment for the whole
regiment in the hop fields and the fruit
orchards. The Sanger Lumber Company
offered permanent employment to sixty *
of the California volunteers at $1 75 a.
day, at places where board could be had
for $15 a month. These offers were en- j
thusiastically received by the committee.
Babbi Voorsanger stated thai a great
number of mustered-out men of other i
States were remaining in San Franciso
and would eventually develop Into '.nee of
th.- great problems with which the com
mittee would have to deal. It was the
sentiment that the Californians should
be provided for before anything could be i
done for the strangers.
Colonel Duboce has expressed his strong
approval of the committee's work and has
Assured them of his hearty co-operation. ]
By his Invitation the members will con j
Bult with him next Friday afternoon at !
regimental headquarters at the Presidio
and arrange for getting a statement of
the condition of every man in the regi- !
ment and his desires as to the future.
Many of the soldiers have already reg
lstereo their applications for work at the
headquarters tent, and among these are
several who apply for positions as bank [
clerks, or are willing to accept any situa
tion the duties of which are not more i
arduous, provided the remuneration is
fully as large.
The efforts being exerted for the re
turned volunteers has suggested the ques
Tion. What is to be 'lone for the families
or relatives of those who will never re
turn â have yielded up their lives for
their -country?
The Red Cross expects to hear of many
.cas-es of destitution among those whose
â providers lost their lives in the Philip
pines. Nothing is being done in the way
of locating such cases or offering relief.
The Red Cross is of the impression that
â¢they are beyond its jurisdiction, but will j
certainly not allow any case of want that i
Js brought to its attention to pass without
receiving the proper attention.
A requisition for $500 will be made on the :
*??ecutlve committee to-day to prosecute
the work of the employment board. The i
latter body has named C. S. Benedict of

institution was
founded in Buffalo, N. V., known as the
Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute,
which has since become one of the most
famous institutions in the world for its
enormous benefits to the sick and suffering
all over the United States. Thousands
have come there for treatment aud tens of
thousands have received professional ad-
vice by mail with suggestions for inexpen-
sive home-treatment, whereby they have
been cured of severe, and in many in-
stances, apparently hopeless diseases.
A Massachusetts man, Mr. John Brooks, of
Bovlston, Worcester Co., writes : " About a year

on mv lungs. The doctors said I was in con-
sumption and could not get well. I took Emul-

for advice. I nave taken your medicine anil it

you that I thought 1 would not live through the

RAILROAD ESTIMATES
NUMBER OF VISITORS
!. According to the statement of G. F.
' Richardson, master of transportation of
the Southern Pacific, that company alone
; brought in to this city 145.000 people to
' I witness the festivities of last week. Of
this number 93,000 arrived over the broad-
gauge, 40,000 over the narrow-gauge and
the coast division brought no less that 12.
--! 000. This count is based on the actual
number of tickets sold and does not in
-1 elude the thousands who arrived before
; the commencement of the week and those
brought here by other lines, which should
swell the total to something like 250,000.
Every one of these joined the entire pop-
ulation on the streets to witness the night
parade.
Traffic Manager McCormick of the
> Southern Paciflc Company denies the re-
cently published report that his company-
has refused to recognize ' the tickets of
j the Rio Grande 'Western and the Colorado
Midland over its lines. Mr. McCormick
Bays that this city is the only place where
tickets over those two lines are not Issued
and that Is because of an agreement en-
tered into with the traffic men of those
roads, which have not yet completed their
end -if it here. Tickets are Issued at Los
Angeles and are honored wherever they
are presented. Mr. McCormick says the
Los Angeles statement is completely un- j
authorized and that he cannot understand
whence it emanated.

George L. Shoup, United States Senator

When seen last night Senator Shoup
said that as yet no decided preparations

CALIFORNIA OFFICERS
RECEIVE PROMOTIONS
Promotions came thick and fast among
| the California men yesterday. There
\ were six in the First Regiment and five
' in the artillery, and there are more to
come.
Major Boxton of the first battalion of
the First Regiment was made lieutenant
colonel; First Lieutenant Curzon, regi
mental adjutant, was made a captain;
Second Lieutenant Adler of Company L
was raised to a flrst lieutenant; Regimen
tal Sergeant Major Badt was maoe a sec
ond lieutenant in Company L; Sergeant
Dowdell of Company tl was made sec
ond lieutenant of his company and First
Sergeant Swan of Company D was made
second lieutenant of his company.
In the artillery battalion First Lieu
tenant J. W. F. Diss of Battery D was
made captain of that battery to succeed
Captain Steere; Second Lieutenant George
L. McKeeby was made a flrst lieutenant
ln Diss' place and First Sergeant Frank
Willard was commissioned a second lieu
tenant in McKei by's place; Second Lieu
tenant A. P. Hayne of Battery A was
made a flrst lieutenant in place of J. B.
Morse, who died in Manila, and First Ser
geant D. J. K-eohane was commissioned
second lieutenant in Haynes' place.
All the commissions date back from the
time the vacancies whicj they fill oc
curred. They are issued by the State,
under the order of the President, which
allows the Governors of the various* Slates
to appoint all officers below the grade of
colonel.
The commissions were presented to the
officers yesterday morning in the presence
of the adjutant general and several mem
bers of the Governor's staff.
There Is a well defined rumor among
the men of the regiment to the effect that
September 21 will be the date for muster-
Ing out.. No date has been set. however.
but if the work be properly attended to
somewhere about the -Ist will be the
time. Yesterday afternoon four companies
had so far recovered from the celebra
tion as to make a good start on the work
of the mustering out papers. The others
will start in earnest this morning.

RUSHING RECRUITS
TO THE ISLANDS
A New Troop of Cavalry for the Pre-
sidio â The Case of Assistant
Surgeon Isaac P. Ware.
More recruits are being prepared at the
Presidio for transportation to Manila. The
Puebla will sail to-day with 650. The War
ren will leave on September 1 with 1200
and the Columbia will leave about Sep
tember 5 with 800 more. This will practi
cally clean cut the camp of casuals now
at the Presidio, and it will probably In
clude one regiment of the four now on
their way here from the East. The first
of these is expected here in two or three
days, and the others will not be long in
following. It was the intention to keep
them here for a month anyway and drill
them in open order tactics and on the rifle
ranges, but it may be that part of them
will be sent out on one of the three trans
ports.
Dr. John J. Gil h uiey, who has for some
time been connected with the general hos
pital at the Presidio, will go out with the
Warren as surgeon in charge. He has been
looking for some time for a chance to get
to Manila, and he says if he can make the
trade with one of the surgeons down there
he will leave the ship when she arrives
and will remain with the hospital service
of the Eighth Army Corps. .
A retiring board met In the ' headquar
ters yesterday to pass upon the mental
capacity of Assistant Surgeon I. P. Ware.
Captain Ware has been on the sick list
ever since he attended the smallpox pa
tient quarantinued at the Presidio some
months ago, and for a long time he has
been unable to attend to his duties. The
retiring board consists of Major General
W. R. Shatter, president; Colonel J. B.
Babcock, adjutant general; Colonel Mor
decal, ordnance department; Colonel For
wood, chief surgeon, and Major Raymond,
Surgeon. â¢ The name of Colonel Parker of
the Twenty-second Infantry was also be
fore the board/ . .
Troop X of the Sixth Cavalry has been
ordered to the Presidio from Fort Riley,
Kansas. It will take the place of Troop
F. Part of Troop F has been on patrol
duty at Yosemite National Park for a
month past, and yesterday the remainder
of the troop left for the same place.
The men of the Colorado regiment
turned over their arms to the post ord
nance officer yesterday. There now re
mains for the regiment but to await the
action of the mustering out officers upon
the regiment's papers, and then for the
men to settle their accounts and leave f6r
home. A special train will take them back
to Denver. I -#
In a circular from headquarters atten
tion is called to the fact that the names
of all legally qualified enlisted men who
desire to appear before a board of officers
for examination for appointment as sec
ond lieutenants in the army, must be at
once reported to headquarters. The ex
aminations are held in the fall of every
year.
Captain William Dasslter, Sixteenth In-
Captain William Dasslter, Sixteenth In
fantry, has been assigned to temporary
duty with Colonel Jocelyn, the mustering
out officer. Â. **
Acting Assistant Surgeon R. M. Bonar
has been assigned to duty at the general
hospital at the Presidio. A similar order
Is out for acting Assistant Surgeon W. R.
Van Tuyl.
Acting Assistant Surgeon Charles A.
McQuesten has been ordered to turn in al.
hospital property for which he is responsi
ble and report to the chief surgeon for thÂ«
annulment of his contract.
BOSTON ORDERED
TO MARE ISLAND
From the present outlook the proposed
reception to the officers and, crew of the
Boston will not take place. It was ar
ranged for Wednesday night of this week,
when â  Market , street would again .be il
luminated, this time in honor of the men
who fought with Dewey in the memor
able Mayday engagement.
It is now officially announced that the
Boston is ordered to proceed to Mare Isl
and this morning. The executive' com
mittee, of which Mayor Phelan is the
head, has been preparing for a royal re
ception, but unless present orders are
countermanded there will be no theater
party for the officers and jackies of the
Boston. Mayor Phelan has telegraphed
Rear Admiral Kautz at Mare Island ask
ing him as a special favor to allow the
Boston to remain in port until after
Wednesday night.
A telegram was received from Washing
ton last night which contained the infor
mation that Rear Admiral Kautz was or
dered to place the Boston out of com
mission and that repairs be made at once
Mare Island. The Mayor stated last
night that, Boston or no Boston, the pro
posed Illumination on Wednesday night
would take place, according to the pres
ent plans of the committee. Some of the
Boston boys might even be brought down
in a launch from Mare Island.

SUISUN GIVES GREETING
TO FATHER McKINNON
Reception Tendered the Chaplain of the
First California by His Former
Parishioners.
REV. FATHER W. D. McKINNON
SUISUN, Aug. 28.â reception ten-
dered to Father W. D. McKinnon,
chaplain of the First California
Regiment, just returned from the
Philippine Islands, was an event ;
long to be remembered by' the residents â¢
of Suisun and this part of Solano County. |
Although the time for preparation was i
short the ladies of the Red Cross Society, I
aided by the firemen and citizens, worked j
with an energy and zeal that produced
wonderful results, and the chaplain was j
accorded a welcome that was spontaneous j
and enthusiastic. All day long busy hands |
were at work making preparations for the !
reception. Decorations of red, white and
blue flags, streamers, vari-colored lan
terns, etc., were placed in positions, many !
of the business houses being decorated in i
an' elaborate manner.
A handsome arch was ' erected in the j
plaza, which was a mass of star-spangled
banners, surmounted by a well-executed I
portrait of Father McKinnon and lighted j
by a large number of electric lights, pre- |
senting a brilliant spectacle. When the j
evening train arrived a vast throng -was
assembled at the depot to welcome the re- â 
turning chaplain, and when he alighted
from the train he was received with huz
zas and cheers of welcome. A procession
was formed, consisting â¢ of some sixty
mounted horsemen, a brass band, car
riages filled with members of the Red
Cross Society, town officers, members of
the press and a long line of firemen and
citizens on foot. . :-v V'_ ::

- PITTSBURG, Aug. -A splendid wel
come was glventhe brave Tenth Pennsyl
vania Volunteers to-day after more than
a year's gallant service in the Philippines.
The only thing lacking to make the day
one of supreme happiness was the ab
sence of the brave and well-beloved
Colonel Hawkins, whose death occurred
on the homeward bound transport. The
crowds that lined, the streets along the
route of the parade, from the parks in
Allegheny to the reviewing stand in
Schenely Park, was almost beyond count
ing. Good judges estimated the number
at not less than 500,000. Besides the fact
that, the soldiers were to be in the parade,
which in itself was a memorable sight, it
was also known that President McKinley,
Mrs. McKinley, Major General Merritt,
Major General Francis V. Greene and
other prominent national and State of
ficers were in the city.
The 'reception of the Philippine heroes
began early in .the morning at New
Brighton,- Pa., where a committee of
prominent citizens welcomed them as soon
as they had crossed the borders of the
State/ After: brief exercises and a hearty
breakfast, tendered by the citizens of
New Brighton, the regiment was rushed
Into Allegheny, .where the parade was
held.
Upon reaching Schenely Park the col
umn was reviewed by President McKinley,
after which he- proceeded tee the music
pavilion, where the exercises were held.
After music by the Economy band, Major
Lee Smith called the meeting to order and
Rev. L. N. Boyle, D. D.. delivered the in
vocation. Governor William A. Stone was
then introduced as chairman of the meet
ing and delivered an address of welcome
in behalf of the State.
President McKinley, being introduced,
said: '
Governor "Stone and Fellow-Citizens: I am
glad to participate with the families, friends
and fellow-citizens of the Tenth Pennsylvania
Volunteers in this glad reunion. You made
secure, and . permanent the victory of Dewey.
You added new glory to American arms. You
and your brave comrades engaged on other
fields of conflict have enlarged the map of the
United States and extended the Jurisdiction of
American liberty.
But while we share in the Joy that is ours.
there remain with us softened and hallowed
memories of those who went forth with you.
After marching through the principal
streets and Illuminating the heavens with
fireworks a halt was made at Native Sons'
Hall. This was quickly filled and the
ovation there tendered Father McKinnon
was full of that patriotism characteristic
of California. An impromptu programme
of music, consisting of national airs, was
rendered, after which an address of wel
come was made by Judge A. J. Buckles,
a veteran of the Civil War. who voiced
the sentiments of tlgse present in his
hearty words of welcome, his remarks be
ing frequently interrupted by the cheers
of the audience.
Father McKinnon then made an address
in reply, giving expression of the cam
paign in the Philippines and eulogizing in
the warmest terms the bravery and gal
lantry of the First California, relating
many incidents of the' heroism displayed
while under fire and while on duty at
Manila. In concluding his remarks he
deprecated the attacks that had been
made upon General Otis and his conduct
of the campaign, and asserted emphatical
ly that history would vindicate every act
of the general. He also gavq it as his
opinion that the warfare in the islands
would soon end, although a guerrilla war
fare might be continued for years.
At the conclusion, the audience arose
and sang "America," and then followed
a general Handshaking and greeting of the
gallant chaplain of the First Californians.
A banquet at the Union Hotel concluded
the reception, which was attended by
about thirty of the leading citizens of the
town and the festivities kept up until a
late hour. ,-'x:X'

I not found in your ranks to-day. Your noble
| colonel, devoted to his men, beloved by his
command and respected by his superior
I officers, gave his life to his country with many
i others of his comrades. The nation sorrows
with the bereaved. The heroes died for their
country, and there is no nobler death.
Our troops represented the truth and con-
science, the pure and patriotism of their
country. They voluntarily remained in the
service and declared their purpose to stay
until their places could be filled by new levies.
and longer if the Government needed their
services, and they understood it was not to
I be in camp or garrison, free from danger, but
j on the battle line where exposure an.l death
1 confronted them and where both have ex
; acted their victims.
! The mighty army of volunteers and regulars
i numbering over 250.000 which last year re
! sponded to the call of the Government with
j alacrity without precedent or parallel, by the
j terms of their enlistment were to be mus-
t ered out. with all of the* regulars above
27.000 men, when peace with Spain was ef
j fected. Peace brought us the Philippines by
I treaty cession from Spain. Every step taken
was in obedience to the requirements of the
i legislation. It became our territory and Is
ours as much as the Louisiana purchase or
I Texas or Alaska. A body of insurgents in ho
I sense representing the sentiment of the people
of the islands disputed our lawful authority,
I and even before the ratification of the treaty
i by the American Senate were attacking the
very forces who fought for and secured 'their
freedom. The world will never knew the re-
straint of our soldiersâ their self-control under
1 the most exasperating conditions. For weeks
i subjected to the insult and duplicity of the in-
surgent leaders they preserved the status quo.
I remembering that they were under an order
: from their Government to sacredly observe the
terms of the protocol in letter and spirit and
j avoid all conflict except in defense pending the
negotiations of the treaty of peace. They were
not the aggressors. They did not begin hos
t tilities against the insurgents pending the
ratification of the treaty of peace in the
Senate, great 'as was their justification, be-
cause their orders from Washington forbade
it. I take all the responsibility for that direc
tion. General Otis only executed the orders of
his Government, and the soldiers, under great
provocation to strike back, obeyed. Until tlÂ»e
treaty was ratified we had no authority be-
yond Manila city, bay and harbor. Spain had
sued for peace. The truce and treaty were not
concluded. The .first blow was struck by the
insurgents. They assailed our sovereignty and
there will he no useless parleyâ no pause until
the Insurrection is suppressed an.l the islands
placed under the undisputed sovereignty of the
United States, a government which will do
Justice to all and at once encourage the best
efforts and aspirations of these distant people
and the highest development of the rich and
fertile lands.
Congressman John Dalzell followed in
an eloquent address, and on behalf of the
citizens of Western Pennsylvania present-
ed each of the commissioned officers a
sword, the chaplain a loving cup and
every man in the regiment a beautiful
I medal. __
WORKMEN UNEARTH
SOME SPANISH RELICS
FIND BONES, SPUR AND SWORD
ON SAN MATEO ROAD.
They Are Supposed to Have Belonged
to a Cavalier Who Long Ago
Met an Untimely Death.
The workmen who are grading for the
San Francisco and San Mateo road
yesterday unearthed a skull, several hu
man bones and some articles supposed to
be Spanish relics. The 'discovery was
made while digging out a trench just
south of Ocean View road and about three
hundred feet north of the county line.
The skull and most of the bones crum
bled to pieces when they were handled,
which shows that they must have been
buried for hundreds of years. The relics
consisted of a spur and three feet of rust
eaten metal shaped like a sword. The
sword also broke into fragments when
extricated from the soil which adhered
to it. :*;â¢â  â -â¢<â 'â¢â .*
The spur bore traces of exquisite Span
ish workmanship when the rust and red
dirt were scraped off. It is a cruel look
ing instrument, having six prongs, each
almost two Inches in length.
Whose the remains are and how long
they have been buried is but mere con
jecture, but it is most likely that some
cavalier in the suite of some Spanish dis
coverers of this coast met with an un
timely death. As there was no sign of
wood or a coffin around the remains it is
supposed that he died with his boots on
in some quarrel with his enemies or com-
E anions. After being shot he was hastily
burled where he fell. This conclusion is
arrived at from a number of small brass
tacks found near by. These tacks were
such as were used to nail leather in shoes.
The relics were about two feet under
ground and were thickly Incrusted with
dirt. The Glen Park people have con
tracted for their exhibition.

SAN MATEO CARS WILL
BE PAINTED GREEN
WORK ON NEW ROADBED NEAR-
ING COMPLETION.
In Two Months Cars Will Be Operated
From Market Street to Holy Cross â¢
Cemetery Without Change.
The construction on the new roadway
of the San Francisco and San Mateo
Railway is going on rapidly and Superin
tendent Southard states that it will be
completed in about two manths. The
double track has been laid to Ocean View
and the ditch for one track has been
opened beyond Daly's Hill in San Mateo
county. All the joints of the rails are be
ing cast welded and a 20-ton roller is run
over the road, thus assuring a perfect
roadbed.
The thirty new cars are nearly all
built and the company has adopted a dark
olive green as the distinguishing color.
The old cars will be painted with the new
color as fast as practicable. Seventy cars
in all will be operated and they will run
from the ferry to the end of the road at
Holy Cross without change, a convenience
which will be appreciated. Other im
provements will be inaugurated and it is
intended to perfect the system in every
detail.
