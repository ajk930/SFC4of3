of advancing under cover of their guns
to positions on the lodges and kopjes ad
jacent to those occupied by the British
troops, on the left of our camp.
"Continuing their advance, the Boers
crept up, using every available means of
Dover. Our infantry opened with a steady,
warm nr. . which beat back i)i< enemy,
notwithstanding a display of tenacity "f
purpose equal to tht-lr desperate stands
on previous occasions. The Boer attack
â  w.-is most elaborate "n all side? <>f the
town.
"The main attack, however, was made
between the Free State and Newcastle
Railway line's by . a column composed
chiefly of Johannlsburg volunteer*. A
brigade of the King's Royal Rifles Corps
made a splendid defense. The Boers were
repulsed, f>ut soon rallied and returned to
the attack. Again the British tire, which
was very hot. forced them to retire. They
had mudc a deep trench In front of tho
British lines, and white withdrawing for
their horses they left this unguarded,
whereupon the Kind's Rifles, advancing
at double quirk, occupied the trench.
"This, smart move was not seen by the
enemy, who soon returned with the
horses. Carefully reserving their fire, the
King's Rifles allowed the Boers to ad
vance almost to the edge of the trench
and then poured volley after volley into
the astounded Boers, who turned and fled
from the awful hall of bullets, bolting
across the open, where the artillery of
the British pound in a terrible and ef
fective shell tire. The enemy lost h.-avil\.
"Meanwhile another section of the
Boers had brought a mortar into action,
firing heavy shells. Our guns, concen
trating on it. soon silenced this weapon,
the artillerymen fleeing headlong. The
Boers thÂ»n advanced in force with a view
of repairing the mortar, but our artillery
Shelled and scattered them right and left.
"The lighting was all over at 11 o'clock.
Promptly at noon (i.-n.-rai Whit.- ordered
a salute of twenty-one guns In honor "f

the cannon boomed, cheer after cheÂ»-r

enthusiasm probably without parallel in
history followed.
"At Caesar's camp, which protects the
town on tho southwest, the Manchester
Regiment held the position Descending

in a ditch out of the way ol British

Into the enemy, scattering them and In
flicting heavy loss.
"The Boers were driven back at every
point, with a loss estimated at WK) men.
Nothing important occurred until Tues
day. November 14, when a strong force,
chiefly cavalry and artillery, r.connolter
lng. came upon the enemy near the Oo
lenso load and drove them buck to thetr
main positions, our shell tire was most
effective and proved to have indicted con
siderable damage. Our loss was .*n>> man.

that dysentery is working havoc, in the

VICTORIA. B. C . Nov. 19.â The tele

ported last night that a vessel was ashore
there. The wire* ceased working almost
Imedlately afterword and no further com
munication has been had with the coast
since. In the absence of definite informa

in the locality during the past few daysj
being the vessel reported by the steamer
Mystery as Ha3hu>Â« red lights off Car

darkness preventing the discovery of her
name by a homeward bound Victoria
steamer, which already lih<l a tow.
Apparently the same vessel was seen a

upon his arrival said that the American
three-mnFt^ed schooner Wnwpna from
Ban Frajjclsco for Puffet Sound had 1.. en

that It wished to l-o reported. It Is be-
Uevjed that the signal was. misunderstood,

formation that the captain of tho vessel
was in difficulty at thut point and had
jisked assistance, but had oeen passed by

FIRE ON THE LINER

Not Bright.
LONDON. Nov. 19.â The Hamburg-

which caught fire in the English channel
lust Wednesday while on her way from
New York to Hamburg, and was finally
abandoned on Thursday noon after at
tempts to tow her to some port had failed,

of the water an hour previous to her sink
ing was seven fathoms. She la still on fire i
forward, but there is no smoke abaft tho '
; bridge. At low water she will be partly >
1 dry.
Apparently thÂ« tire has completely gut
â  ted her and rendered her a total wreck. '
The surveyors could not get on board to- i
j day. but they will do so as soon as possi
ble In order to ascertain what the pros- |
pects are of any salvage. Arrangements i
are being made to lighten the vessel. The
partial submersion has materially dimin
ished the tire, which it Is thought will be I
extinguished;
The Patria had an adventurous time

called after a few hours for the assist

TON HOTEL. I.ASHTNQTON, Nov. 1Â».-
Acting Secretary Allen was noti"
the departure of the supply ship Culgoa
from Hongkong for the Island of Kami
guln. It Is believed by the department
from dispatches already cabled by Ad
miral Watson that the CulgÂ«-a lias on
board the representatives of a wrecking
firm In Hongkong, with such apparatus
as can be placed aboard the vessel, who
will make an effort to save the Charles
ton or at least ascertain the condition
she is In preliminary to further work or
abandoning her altogether.
The authorities had expected by this
time to have received Information of the
condition of the Charleston from the gun
boat Helena, which was sent to Kaml
guln by Rear Admiral Watson upon re
ceipt of news of the wreck for the pur
pose of supplying the men with food and
bringing as many as possible to Manila
and also to examine the condition of the
wrecked ship. It Is considered possible
that the Helena may have attempted to
haul the Charleston off the rocks
whereon she lies, but the authorities
admit that this Is purely speculation. It
is generally admitted at the department
that the hope of raising the Charleston
Is very slight, but still It Is prop.
do everything to at least save some of
her small guns and equipment.
A naval officer who recently returm-d
from the Asiatic station said to-day that
I the wrecking outfits at Hongkong were
, not strong enough to handle the Charles
i ton, and ne predicted although an effort
; may be made that before work 1? com
pleted she will have been so battered by
seaa and rocks upon which she struck
that it will be useless to attempt to take
h.-r to Manila.
An examination of the mall reports re
ceived by the department from the
Asiatic station shows that a larg.- per*
centage of the American men-of-war
I have grounded since th.- destruction of
the Spanish fleet In the harb..r of Manila.
I It Is a matter of surprise t" officials. In
view of the character of the charting
done by th.; Spaniards, that more Ameri

Equipment, proposes to expedite the
purveying of the waters of the Philip

Rich Find of Three Prospectors in the

TACOMA, Nov. 19. â Hirnm Davleil has
brought from Ketchikan BOOM of the fin

even seen here. Th.y c;im.- from Traitors
Cove, on Benin Canal, twenty*eigbt miles
northeast of Ketchikan. Associated with
Davlea are Samuel J. Powell of Seattle
and Jam.- Tennant of Oakland. \
and Tennant went to Ketchikan last
March and Davlea Joined tb.-m In April.
The three prospected through the summ.-r
in different locations In the Ketchikan dis
trict, finding and locating several good
properties. The rich lead from which the
.specimens n l wÂ«re obtained was
discovered only last month by tracing
of float until the ledge was uncov
ered, Bv< ry piece of ledge broken off was
rich In gold.
They found that the ledge continues
Into the sea and by stripping off the moss
from the rocks above they could trace
each quartz seam up the mountain side
for 300 feet, or as far as they stripped the
moss. They are satisfied that the ledge
continues clear to the top of the moun
tain, some 2500 feet above tide water. The
ledge matter Is some thirty feet between
the walls, all rich In free gold, but the
\.-ry rich pay streak from which the rich
est apedmeni were obtained is from three

The gold is of very fine quality, assaying

Wreck.
VICTORIA. B. C. Nov. 19.â The barkentlne Jane A. Falkenburg of San
Francisco, which sailed from the Golden Gate on September 23. and a month
later left Port Hadlock to return thither with a full cargo of lumber, was
towed Into Esquimau to-night by the tug Lome, which found her floating a
derelict with seas washing over and through her "fT Cape Flatten.'. She Is a
hopeless wreck. Her bulwarks and forecastle head were torn away. The
hatches are off. main and mlzzen masts have gone by the board. Her cabin
and houses are gutted. The lumber has swollen and Is opening the deck up.
The lower foremast Is the only thing standing above tne devastated deck
house. The rigging and ratlines are standing to this mast and a sadly torn
foresail Is tangled up in them. The remnants of a flag, seemingly a house
flag, with red stars on white ground. Is hanging on the rigging. A black cat
was found on board, still living, but in an emaciated condition. It was taken
possession of by the tug's crew and ate ravenously when given food.
The Lome when she picked up the derelict barkcntlne was bound up the
Vancouver Island coast." whither she was dispatched to the rescue of the ship
reported ashore between Carmanah and Cape Beale. A heavy gale was rag
ing and the tug was almost swamped by the great seas which swept In on
board. There was a foot and a half of water In the engine room. At 7 a. m.
thÂ« Lome sighted the Falkenburg tossing In the heavy seas about three miles
from Flattery. The tug Holyoke sighted her simultaneously and both raced
for her. The Lome lowered â  boat which landed the mate and two mm on
her a few seconds before the Holyoke was close enough to allow her men to
jump on the wreck. The Lome claimed her as salvage prize and passed a .
hawser on board. She was then towed to Esquimau. Although a close search
was made nothing was found but the cat. which was nestled In one of the
forecastle bunks, and dishes which were still In the locker in the cabin un
broken, although all other interior fittings were torn out.
The Puget Sound Tugboat Company, owners of the Lome, will endeavor
to sell the prize and waterlogged cargo. No word was received of tho other
wreck. The ship Highland Light, overdue from San Francisco, Is reported
off the coast with her rudder gone.

BIRMINGHAM, Ala., Nov. 13.â
strange phenomenon, supposed to be a
part of the tricennlal meteoric disturb
ance scheduled by the astronomers, was
observed here to-night between 9 o'clock
and midnight. The fiery messengers
made thslr appearance directly overhead
and attracted much attention and no little
fear among the negroes.
As many as ten meteors were seen, all
of them In the nebulae form. resembling
comets. They first appeared as patches
of light and at times would glow a fiery
red and then fade away, repeating the
operation a number of times before they
disappeared. During the lurid period tho
central body would be easily seen, tho
light radiating throughout the entire

NEW YORK. Nov. 19.â A special to the j
Journal from Washing: on says: That an !
army â¢'â â -- wife should be robbvd
on beard v I'nited States transport, and i
â¢ hould die for lack of proper attention, j
food and medicine, is looked upon here
as an evidence of a hideous state Â«>f af
fairs, that no denial from those respon<l-
Me can controvert. The death of Mrs.
Collins,, wife of Oapta'n Charles L. Col
lins of the Twenty-third Infantry. is
<-hargcd to the terrible condition whl.-h
prevailed on the horror ship Tartar on her
voyage from Manila to San Francisco.
<iene.ral Fhafter is now conducting a
third examination, with special reference
to the case of Mrs. Collins. The sister
of Mrs. Collins recently wrote Secretary
Root a letter, in which she detailed th"<Â»
circumstances of Mrs. Collins' treatment
<Â«:i the way from Manila. Mrs. Collinn
whs sick during the voyage, but this did
not prevent her from being robbed of

Collins WSJ wofully neglected as a pa
tient. This lnfainfus treatment, It la as
serted. I*<l to her death. The investigation
ir:to this case. It has been ordered, must
be thoroughly conducted.
The officials here think the real blame
attaches at Manila, and that eventually

the Initial arrangements. Quartermaster

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, NOVEMBER 20, 1809.
GUARDING AGAINST
BUBONIC PLAGUE
Crew of the J. W. Taylor
Detained.
; itch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Nov. 19 -The steamer J.
WJ Taylor, which arrived yesterday from
Santos, Brazil, with the captain and cook
ill with suspected bubonic plague, has
been disinfected as far as possible with
out discharge of cargo. The patients
are at Swinburne Island and there Is no
change in their condition.
Deputj Health Officer Sanborn says
the crew will be kept on board the steam
er until to-morrow, when the agents will
supply a new crew. The crew will be re
tnoved to Hoffman Island and detained
for observation for ten days. There has
been no further development among them.
After the removal of the crew the cargo
(coffee in sacks) will i..- discharged into
lighters. The sacks will he emptied Into
oilier receptacles and then subjected to
â team disinfection on board the James
\V. Wadsworth. After the disctiarge of
the cargo the holds will be disinfected.
Dr. Fitzpatriek. the bacteriological ex
pert of the quarantine service, is making
cultures <Â»f matter taken from the pa
tients. The result of his examinations
will determine the question of the dis
charge of the cargo.
Dr. Hermann M. Biggs, bacteriologist of
the Health Department, gave out this
statement to-day regarding Dr. Park's
examination of the supposed bubonic
plague patients:
'â¢The bacteriological examinations thus
far made by Dr. Park show apparently
that the contents of the broken down bu
bos do not contain living germs. It is pos
sible, however, that me mi develop In
the cultures. Microscopical examinations
of the pus re rather negative. These neg
ative results are such as might be expect
ed in the plaguo at the stage of the dis
ease presented In these men and would be
very unusual in other conditions. They
therefore ailord some contlrmatory evi
dence as to the existence of the plague."
Dr. Uipgs said he had little doubt that
the two patients supposed to have the dis
ease are now almost well. The bacterio
logical examinations will be continued so
long as the patients of the infected ship
present the opportunity. This Is the tlrst
time the physicians of this city have had
an opportunity to study the disease direct
ly. li' to this time they have depended
upon foreign medical reports, which are
not always authentic. Health Commis
sioner Oosby said that he had no doubt
the ship is roughly disinfected. But
even so. it would not be permitted to come
to the city. The Health Department will
take no chances, he said.
In forbidding the docking of the ship
or her approuch to any wharf, the author
ities have been actuated by the fear that
thÂ« 4 rats which Infest the vessel will get
ashore and carry the germs. If the dis
ease proved to the bubonic plague, with
them.
Experience with the bubonic plague In
foreign countries show that the rat is a
potent factor In the spread of the disease.
It being affected by the bubonic baeelllus
in a similar way to man. In Nothnagles
laboratory in Vienna several rears ago
one of the assistants developed the plague,
from contamination from a rnt into which
he had Inoculated tho disease.

Company of Larkspur, has been arrested

ways of that suburban villa and refusing

SHIPPING OF FOREIGN NATIONS
OUTGROWING THAT OF AMERICA
Commissioner of Navigation's Report Shows the Results
of the Congressional Neglect of the United
States Merchant Marine.
WASHINGTON, Nov. T9-The anmi
aJ report of Mr. Chamberlain, tho
Commissioner of Navigation, shows
that American shipping Industries
shored in the general prosperity of the
country during the past fiscal year. Tae
returns disclose more satisfactory condi
tions than those of any former year In the
bureau's history. The total documented
tonnage on June 30. 1599. comprised J i.7_"s
vessels of 4.564.238 gross tons, which ia our
largest since 1865.
The tonnage operating under our coast-
Ing laws, 21,397 vessels of 4,015.952 gross
I tons. is the largest In our history and
j greater than the coasting tonnage of any
! other nation. Our steam tonnage. 2,476.011
I tons, for the nrst time exceeds the ton
nage of all other craft. In the rest of the
world steam tonnage eleven years ago ex
ceeded sail tonnage. Our tonnage regis
tered for foreign trade remains small, and
last year American vessels carried a frao
i tion less than 9 per cent of our exports
J and Imports, the eiÂ»alleÂ«t percentage In
I our history- Based on bureau veritas re
turns, the world's seagoing sail tonnage
in the past quarter of a century has de
creased from 14.155.536 tons to 5.61Â«3.70y tons,
I a decrease of 40 per cent. The decrease
' in the United States has been at the aver
age rate. The world's seagoing tonnage In
; the same period has increased from 4.325,
193 tons to 13, 887,132 tons, or 3C6 per cent.
i The phenomenal Increases have been Nor
way's- 1400 per cent, and Germany's nearly
700 per cent. The Increase of the United
j States has been only 68 per cent, and the
1 Increase of American steam tonnage reg
j lstered for foreign trade on Atlantic and
( Gulf coasts has been only 35 per cent.
The development of Alaska within the
! past few years has caused a rapid in
crease in the Pacific Coast trade.
Within the past twenty years the United
States, In seagoing steam tonnage, has
dropped from the second place, next to
Great Britain, to the fourth position, be
low Germany and France, and if steam
ships in foreign trade alone are consid
ered, below Norway and Spain and only
slightly ahead of Japan.
'1 he report reviews briefly the legisla
tion of other nations In behalf of their
merchant shipping, showing that last year
European nations and Japan expended
over 126,000,000 to promote it in various
forms, while the United States. spent only
$955,211. On their steamship lines to China
and Japan foreign nations expended about
J5.0-JO.OOO. while for the same purpose the
United States expended less than J4'j,o'jO.
The establishment of two or more fast
American steamship lines on the Pad lie
Coast to connect with A.-..1 will furnish
the capitals of Western Europe with
closer mail and passenger connections by
from three to five days than is now possi
ble by the heavily subsidized British, Ger
man and French steamship lines through
the Suez canal.
The reasons which Impel other nations
to develop their merchant shipping, says
Mr Chamberlain, apply with equal force
to the United States. Among them are:
First, the relations of the navy to the
merchant marine as an element of na
tional defense; second, relations of mer
chant marine to Insular territory; third.
Its relation to new markets in Asia, Af

Cnlppewa outbreak of last autumn. Com
missioner Jones says:
"For many years the Chlppewas have
been arrested and taken from their homes
to St. Paul and other points as \\r
or as offenders, chiefly In whlslcv â 
often wholesale arrests have been made
solely for the fees which would accrue to
th* officials. Indians have been helped to
obtain whisky by the very ones who ar
rested them for using it. In some cases
Indians carried off to court have been
left to get ba< k home a* betst they could.
The whole matter of arrests by* deputy
marshals had come to be a farce, a frawd
and a hardship to tho Chlppewas and a
disgrace to the community."

fourth. lh< : : the best
mall facilities 1 Hag; fifth, the
relations of the merchant marine to ex
ports and imports and the value of the
carrying trade, and finally, the promotion
of shipbuilding and contributory tno.ua
trlca,
By various methods of computation, the
annual value of the ocean carrying trade
of the United States is estimated at about
1175.000,000, including passenger and immi
grant fares and payments for ocean malls
to and from the United States. The argu
ment that American shipping in the for
eign trade Is handicapped by tariff duties
Is met by reference to progressive legis
lation beginning In 1572. by which for the
last five years all materials for the con
struction of American vessels In the for
eign trade and all supplies for such ves
sels have been exempt from duties. Ton
nage taxes, which are Imposed equally on
foreign and American vessels, are the
only form of Federal taxation of Ameri
can shipping. The proposition to repeal
tonnage taxes would, therefore. In effect,
be equivalent to a bounty of about $750.
000 annually to foreign shipping and would
relieve American shipping of only JSO.OuO
of taxes annually.
The report then takes up the methods
which have recently been suggested for
the promotion of the American merchant
marine. It Is pointed out that discrimin
ating duties on cargoes In foreign ves
sels or on the tonnage of foreign vessels
are an impracticable remedy on account
of treaty provisions. The same objec
tions apply to the proposition to grant
bounties on exports in American vessels.
The proposition to grant American regis
try to foreign-built vessels In the foreign
trade is not regarded as feasible, in view
of the fact that the cost of operating ves
sels under the American flag is .-oticed
e<lly much greater than the cost of operat-
Ing foreign vessels. The appropriation to
develop merchant marine through ocean
mall subsidies is only a partial solution
of the question. While the need of at
least two fast mall steamship lines to
Asia and one to South America Is Indis
putable, the establishment of ship lines
would not suffice to put our navigation
and -shipbuilding on a satisfactory basis.
The report Is In the main devoted to a
consideration of Senate bill 6590, reported
by Senator Frye at the last session as a
SUbsitUte for the bills introduced by Sen
ator llaniia and Representative Payne
It 1- pointed out that thÂ« maximum ex
penditure under that bill for any one
year Is fixed at 19.000.000, from which
however, should be deducted J1.500,000. the
present cost of carrying our ocean malls
on American vessels, which will continue
whatever the fate of the bill may be. The
actual maximum annual expenditure pro
posed by the bill Is thus in effect fixed at
17,600.000. Assuming that all our vessels
registered for foreign trade were fully
occupied throughout the year at the pres
ent time the new expenditure under, the
bill would be In round numbers $3,000 CkO
Before the maximum Is reached, the ca
pacity of our shipyards must be increased
many times, but tonnage under our flag
engaged in the foreign trade must be
multiplied several fold. This increase in
the capacity of our shipyards and in our
tonnage in foreign trade will show ability
on our part to compete on more nearly
even terms with foreign nations. The pro
rata reductions In compensation provided
tw^'. en the maximum expenditure of
J?.UX).ouO is reached will thus coincide with
the lessened need of Government assist
ance.

This Is deemed In justification for the
proposition In the bill to give a dbÂ«tlnct
allowance to American steamships of
fourteen knots or upward.
The report recommends moderate In
creases in our tonnage taxes, equalizing
them with those imposed at the principal
Kuropean ports, ar.d favors the passage
of the bills applying the laws of the
Lnlted States relating to commerce, .nav
igation and merchant seamen to Hawaii
and Porto Rico, thus bringing these Isl
ands under the coasting laws of. the
united States. It Is recommended that
vessels owned by Cubans be placed by
law on an equality with vessels belonging
to the most favored nation.
Under an existing statute It has been
necessary to Impose a tonnage tax of t\
per gross tonâ practically prohibitoryâ
upon such vessels, and this Injustice., both
to ourselves and Cubans, can be remedied
only by legislation.
under the so-called White bin for the
protection of seamen American sailors
now enjoy a larger degree of personal lib
erty than ever before and much more
than the seamen of any other nation,
that law radically changing the nature of
the seamen's agreement. Reports from
shipping commissioners show that the al
lotment sections have been of decided
benefit to seamen and that efforts to
break down these sections during â¢ the
spring and early summer have failed and
the law is in the main successfully en
forced.
Attention is directed to the menace to
navigation resulting from the long tows
of coal barges along the Atlantic coast,
especially at New York. Boston and other
important harbors, and of large timber
rafts on the Pacific coast.

THE LATEST WALL STREET GAME.
re week was the ex-
of the Wall-street conspiracy to bleed
borrowers. For months Wall street has been.
groaning under the burden of tight money, and sev
eral weeks ago the Government was implored to re
lieve the stringency by buying back bonds issued by
previous administrations. But the Government at
first declined, saying that the stringency was no:
mercantile but speculative, and artificial at that, It
was openly charged, and subsequently discovered, that
certain iihvlocks in the street were borrowing im
mense sums of money that they did not need and
leaving it in the lenders' hands subject to ca!L All
' such money was, of course, withdrawn from circula
tion, funds became scarce, and the wealthy borrowers
then loaned their own private money at ruinous rates,
of interc^. liut the pressure became so great that
ai length the Government did consent to buy bonds â
not to the amount of $100,000,000 as desired, but to
the amount of $.25,000,000. The sequence was amus
ing and instructive to the whole country*. The joke
was, that after all the outcry for the purchase of bonds
very few parties could be found who wanted to sell.
The banks immediately declined, saying that the
money market was tight only in Wall street, and
they preferred to keep their bonds. A syndicate to
, sell $10,000.000. was formed and that was all. So the
Government's charges proved true.
The efTcct, however, was good. The money mar
ket at once eased off, being assisted by a material in
crease in the circulation by liberal call loans by the
banks. London, too, appeared in the market as a
moderate buyer of our securities, so the situation
became much easier.
There are growing indications of a halt in the iron
boom. Pigiron has indeed advanced, but manufac
tared products are weakening, and the new demand
does not offset the completion of old orders. How
ever, the latter are sufficient to keep the majority of
mills running far into the coming year. The minor
metals continue to decline, as a rule. On the other
hand, many lines are showing continued strength.
Lumber is firm and active. Wool is also in good
demand, both for export and local account, and
cereals, hides and leather, boots and shoes have ruled
firm for some time, though wheat weakened off
somewhat. Prices for provisions suffered some shad
ing. The textile manufactures continue to sell freely,
though wool products are hampered by the rise in
the raw product.
The bank clearings of the country fell of? last week.
being only 17.6 per cent larger than for the same
week last year, though every large city except St.
Paul showed a gain. The gains, however, showed a
scaling down everywhere from recent levels, and
Pittsburg dropped to 68.1 per cent, with New York
showing a gain of only 16 per cent and Chicago 21.
per cent. The failures for the week were 219, against
223 last year, which is also a less favorable showing
than for some months.
On this coast there are few new features. All lines
continue to report activity, with no diminution in
the demand for all sorts of goods. Fluctuations in
produce and merchandise have been few, but almost
always in the direction of higher prices. The con
tinued rains promise a year of heavy crops, and as
most farm and orchard products are bringing Rood
prices the effect on the community hi excellent. Col
lections arc reported pood, failures are infrequent
and small, and solvent borrowers find no difficulty in
feenring funds at reasonable rates of interest. As far
as California is concerned the situation could hardly
be better.
A witness in a will contest at San Rafael testified
the other day that he considered hi* mother of un
sound mind M she came to hit house one day in
a dress that had no - res. That witness probah'y
never attended one of the swell functions of the
Four Hundred.
A movement is on foot to pet nil the manufacturers
of cameras into a pipantic trustâ to focus photo
crapl.ic capital, as it were.
STREET LIGHTING PROBLEMS.
LITERALLY it is a dark prospect that confronts
San Francisco this winter so far as the lighting
of the streets is concerned. Under the present
arrangement large districts of the city are but dimly
; lighted on any night and the whole city is left ur.-
I lighted for seven nights out of every thirty. During
1 those nights the only illuminations upon even our
rst thoroughfares are those which are radiated
from t:.e of shops, are supplied by private
r are given by the moon.
Such a condition in a city of the wealth and popu
rrancisco amounts to what is virtually
; a municipal disgrace. It is an evidence of incom
cy ar.c inefh'cier.cy in the administrative authori
f the ami â¢ That, however, is not novr
- KM in point. The question is not who is to be
for the situation, but how to provide a
remedy for it c on the moon, on shop win
privatc enterprise may be sufficient to fur
msh light! -age, but not for a great city, and
efforts should be made at once to provide the :
â  eeds of the community rie:nar.d.
It is conceded that the task is one of some diffi-
The appropriations for lighting d'iring the
fiscal year hive been made and cannot be changed.
.Supervisor . however, has suggested in an
interview with The Call a plan by which something
at least may be accomplished. It is to have the out
going and the incoming Boards of Supervisors agree
-mselves to create a deficiency in the
â  lighting fund, and in that way provide for light
| ing the streets during the winter even.' night in the
; month. The sukjeestion affords a basis upon which
oild. It may not be approved by other officials,
â¢ it is at any rate something definite and to the
?e and serves therefore as a good starting point
which tn go forward in dealing with the issue.
One thing is certain. Responsibility for the dark
1 ness of the Â«treets for so many nights out of every
th rests upon the officials of the city. It is use

OUR DOCK FACILITIES. -
STATEMENTS made in an interview with The
1 by T. C. Friedlander, secretary of the San
Fra: . r . luce Exchange, recall public at
tention to the importance of increasing the facilities
r receiving large ocean steamers and
accoi . - commerce which they bear. In
urse of I a Mr. Friedlander is quoted
as ha "We cannot wait long. Steamers of
10,000 tons are building, and it is intimated that the
: Coast terminus of the Jine upon which they
r.in will be at Seattle. If we wish to have 10,000
' imcrs come here we have to move.'
There is no exaggeration in these statements. The
increase in the magnitude of ocean going vessels has
forced even the greatest ports in the world to device
plans for meeting the requirements of their trade.
vements and dock improvements arc
being discussed in every seaport of note on the
globe. The rapidity with which the tonnage of ves
sels is being increased Â«as shown by a recent state
ment concerning shipbuilding in Great Britain, from
which it appears that there were thirty-five more
launched in Great Britain in the first eight
months oi n in the same period of 1899, but
the gross tonnage was 222,747 tons less in the former
year. In the first eight months of 1898 there were
Mxty-' :.e more ships launched than in the same
period of 1899, but the gross tonnage was 7688 tons
less. In other words, the average tonnage of the
ships launched in iKgj was 1535; in 1898 it was 1905,
and in i>v9 it was 2191.
The economic forces of the time compel the con
struction of large vessels, since the larger ship can
freight at a less proportionate cost than the
smaller one. In discussing the subject Senator Frye
recently sa id: "When the largest freighter was 3000
the rate across the Atlantic was $8 50 a ton;
when 6000 tons, $6 a ton; when 8000 tons, $3 50 a
ton; when 10,000 tons, $2 50 a ton." From that
record it will be seen that a port which cannot ac
commodate the largest of ocean steamers will not
lon^' hold its own as a metropolis of commerce. Mr.
Friedlander was right in saying. "If we wish to have
10,000 ton steamers come here we have to move," and
he might have added that if we wish to keep moving
we must provide for steamers of that size to come.
THE BUFFALO VOTIhG MACHINE
SHORTLY after the recent elections we directed
attention to reports given of the excellent re
sults obtained from the use of balloting ma
chines in several of the larger cities of New York.
One of the effects of the good showing that was
j made has been a revival in the East of public interest
in that system of voting, and the whole question is
now being discussed with â  good deal of elaboration.
The Buffalo Express has given some interesting in
formation concerning the manner in which the ma
chines arc operated and the time which the average
voter requires to vote by means of them. In the
course of the article the Express says:
"The process :u the ; cry simple. There
were tour election - clerks on the reg
;arty had a watcher checking
'rom ot the â .
ting time who

TITK SAX FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, NOVEMBER 20, 1809.
That is, if 330 men had voted ahead of him he was
No. 331. Between him and the machine probably
were four men in line, while others waited behind
him. He moved up until he reached the machine in
turn, when he told his name and number to the man
with the watch, then stepped up, threw over the top
lever which closed the curtain beuind him, voted,
threw back the curtain, and went out."
As an illustration of the rapidity with which the
voting can be done by the machine it is said: "One
minute is a long time in which to vote. To test what
could be done within the minute one voter pulled the
straight Republican lever, threw back its pointers,
polled the Democratic lever and threw back its point
ers, repeated it twice, split on seven Republicans,
threw back their pointers, split on six Democrats,
threw back their pointers, closed up both lines of
ten, then pulled a party lever and voted. He
did not hurry, and when h e came out he had used
just fifty-two seconds."
A votinc machine that makes a record of that kind,
and which does its work with rapidity, accuracy and
economy is certainly better than the system now in
vogue which leaves so much room for errors if not
frauds in the count. Sooner or later all large cities
in the country will adopt the machines, and it may
be safely said in most of them the sooner they do it
the better.
An Oakland man has raised himself to the danger

THE OMERICON WOMAN fIBRO^D
OXE of the interesting facts which has been
given br ination by the war between
the British and the Boers is the position
American women occupy in British society. They
constitute a distinct element in the social world and
I are recently organized themselves into an associa
tion bearing the distinctive title "American Women,"
for the purpose of supplying hospital stores for the
sick and the wounded of the army.
There are a great many women of British birth in
the L':r!:ei S-.ates, but they do not parade the fact
nor are they a distinguishable element in any gather
ing or in any work. It is true that in politics we
have bodies of men known as German-Americans or
Iri?h-Americans, but these exist for campaign pur
poses only. They have no social existence and are
never thought of in relation to social functions. The
American woman, however, when she goes abroad
remains an American to the extent at least of assert
ing her nativity and making it felt in every direction.
Some of the leaders of the American woman's as
sociation for raising money ior the wounded of the
war have been living in Great Britain for yeari.
They^are the wives of British lords and statesmen,
the mothers of British sons, but they still cling to the
American name. There seems to be a sort of pa
triotism in them that survives all the changes which
years of absence from their native land bring about.
"In spite of all temptations to belong to other na
tions" they insist upon being known as American
women. So we have Lady Randolph Churchill,
whose son at the front is now a prisoner in the hands
of the Boers, and Mrs. Chamberlain, wife of the
Secretary of State for the Colonies, posing not a?
.'.l matrons but as American women, and under
that title doing work for the cause in which their
hearts are engaged.
In a certain respect it is not altogether satisfactory
to have these ardent women displaying their devotion
to the British so conspicuously under the title of an
association of American women. The term might be
misleading. Persons not familiar with the facts
might readily presume from the reports that the
women of America are sympathizers with the British,
when as a matter of fact the majority of them are not.
For example a recent dispatch from London said:
"American women have been enabled to express
their sympathy for England in the Queen's own
womanly way, when diplomatic etiquette and pro
priety have silenced the Embassy. The American
scheme for equipping a hospital ship for the wounded
soldiers and distressed refugees has commanded ad
miration and respect and has been carried out with
great spirit and practical skill. Mrs. Blow is credited
with having been the first to suggest the movement,
but Lady Randolph Churchill has taken full charge of
it, with the assistance of all the best-known American
women in England."
Clearly that is not a fair statement. It misrepre
sents the case, for the women who are doing so much
for Great Britain and showing their sympathy are
not really representative American women in the full
meaning of the word. Since they have taken the
title, however, it is pleasing to note they are doing
their work with eminent success. They have raised
something like $150,000 and got a steamship to take
the supplies to South Africa. To that extent at any
rate they prove themselves truly American women.
When they go for money they get it, and moreover
they get it promptly.
William F. Herrin is. displaying a remarkable de
gree of candor. In an argument before the Inter
state Commerce Commission at St. Louis he said
that the Southern Pacific Company does not regu
late freight rates to yield profit to others. He would
have been fully as candid and more truthful if he had
said that the Southern Pacific Company regulates
freight rates to permit no profit to others.

PHILIPPINE OIL FIELDS
About 2400 copies of the splendid book
of 608 pages, "California Mines and Min
erals," published by the California Min
ers' Association under the direction of
Secretary E. H. Benjamin, as a souvenir
of the California meeting of the Amer
can Institute of Mining Engineers In Sep
tember, were last week shipped to the
office of the secretary of the Institute.
Rossi ter W. Raymond, in New York, who
will distribute them by mail to the mem
bers of the institute. Secretary Raymond
generously offered to do this, which will
save the California Miners' Association
several hundred dollars in postage. There
have already been given or mailed to
members of the Institute 1*54 copies, mak
ing 2otU forwarded to members. The pub
lishers delivered 23*S copies, and of the
balance of 421 copies all but 100 have been
delivered to subscribers or sold. There
are many locs inquiries for the work
and many people have expected free cop
ies and been disappointed, but the few
copies remaining are held at the price of
$5 each for the benefit of the association
treasury.
It should be remembered that the costly
work was not prepared and published for
a large California distribution, but as a
worthy souvenir of the ban Francisco
meeting of the distinguished body that
leads the miring industry and to give 25At
or so. of the leading mining engineers of
the country and of the world a compre
hensive knowledge of the greatness and
opportunities of the California mining
field. There Is already evidence that it
will be of Incalculable value In this way.
Inquiries for it from all parts of the world
art' already coming to the olllce of Sec
retary Benjamin, who is himself Just now
absent in Alaska. Copies have been sent
to foreign members of the institute In
Canada. Asia. Russia, various countries
of Europe and to South Africa, and re
quests for the work have already come
from all these quarters of the world. The
same mall last week brought one inquiry
from a mining superintendent at Rat
Ports . Canada, and from an engineer
in many. The latter is Arthur Dlesel
dorff of the University of Marburg, who
writes that he wants its aid In preparing
some articles for a Gem geological
magazine op features of the California
mining field with which he Is acquainted.
Among his topics will be th* sulphur
bank and New Almaden quicksilver de
posits, the latest oil fields, gold statistics,
etc. v
"It Is not for curiosity and for shelving
the volume forever In some bookcase
that I so much want the work, but for
publication in this country." he says.
"California Mines and Minerals" will
soon be out of print, but It will long be
a reference work in nearly 3000 libraries
that will stimulate interest in California
mines and afford material for writers
thereon. ~\
' The widespread search for petroleum
now goins on through California will have
scientific as well as Industrial importance.
Every well that la put down, even by the
foolish or by the rascally promoters, may
be a valuable contribution to the geology
of the State If competent records me
kept. There is much to be known about
the occurrence of oil in this State and of
the extent of the oil yielding formations,
and every reliable record of drilling will
be Interesting to scientific students of
this field. In the Eastern States the geo
logical problems connected with oil and
gas yielding formatlones have been pretty
thoroughly worked out. In California the
conditions are quite different, as is the
oil Itself, and it will be an important field
tor geological study for years.
The activity of county recorders and of
dealers in oil well machinery and sup
plies la an index of the increasing activity
in the oil field. Companies are springing
up over night in all directions, and many
of them have begun drilling or will do so
in the near future. The San Joaquin Val
ley is being scoured by agents and pro
motors with capital and with shoestrings
looking for "oil land," and many of them
are the easiest suited people in the world
when it comes to a location. Most any
thing will do for the prospectus. Many
companies are conducting bona fide opera
tions, and new fields can hardly fail to be
developed.
In Kern County large tracts are being
secured for oil operations throughout a
large region, Quite a number of wells are
being driven In the McKlttrick district,
and one or two have developed small
yields at comparatively slight depths. A
company Is about to drill near San Carlos
Creek, on the west side of Fresno County,
near the San Benito County line. Opera
tions are also under way In the Park
field region of Monterey County.
Ix)S Angek-s yet controls the trade In oil
well machinery and supplies, and dealers
there have beeen pressed to fill orders re
cently. A large business in this line will
undoubtedly soon be built up in San
Francisco.
The Santa Fe Company Is building a
branch road from RkhnVld to Its Fuller
ton oil field, and this will aid the further
development >>t this region.
In the Coallnga field a company that Is
boring has failed to' reach oil yt-t, but it
struck a water flow of NO barrels a day
and sold It to other people that needed
wator, thus paying a considerable part of
its expense for drilling.
Borne extensive oil operations are going
on In San Luis Obispo County which may
yet become an important oil producer.
State Senator storehouse and several
San Francisco business men have leased
about 4000 acres on a 10 per cent royalty,
and other large tracts have been leased or
bonded. Several rigs for drilling have
been sent up from Los Angeles.
Summerland. in Santa Barbara County.
Is having oil luck both ways. New wells
are going down In land and in sea. and
last week two companies struck yields of
oil. One Is a -ha it el well. The in
crease In wells and in production Is en
couraging, but they can't get rid of the
oil. The Southern Pacific Company can
not supply can to haul it away, so large
Is the demand for cars by the Coallnga
field and from elsewhere. The car famine
ha? reached the oil Industry. Every Sum
merlar.d tank Is full, an'! last week two
companies found themselves In the posi
tion, "Oh. dear! If we pump we'll lose
the oil. and If we don't pump we'll lose
the well." As some wells would fill up if
operations were suspended those two
companies pumped away and let the oil
run Into the pea. More expected to have
to do likewise.
Of the Los Angeles oil field the Times
says: "This year the output will be ,i trifle
larger than last year. Although there is
.a large Increase In the number of
wells, there Is a falling off In the pro
duction of the field east of the Sisters'
Hospital, and also In the central field,
which will keep the total production near
that of last year. Better prices Is a most
welcome factor this year. The average
price of oil been between $1 and $1 35
per barrel, and with approximately the
Fame production as that of 159S will place
the value of this year's production very
near $2,900,000. In the local Held to-<tay
there are over 300 men employed, ab al
the dally average for the year. The aver
age wage per man is $2 SO per day, mak
ing a. total of about $227,500 paid during
the year for labor. Money paid for labor,
of course, soon finds its way Into circu
lation, local merchants reaping the
benefit. New fields are being opened in
the extreme southwestern part if f ho
city, and experts say that the outlook is
very bright. The use of oil as fuel Is
becoming more general every day."
There are 663 wells in the Los Angeles
field, an lim rcase of 113 over 189S and of 340
over 1597. The yield in UN was 1.171.371
barrels, which was sold at the average
jirlce of C 5 cents per barrel.

Interest In oil and in the Phlllppfrie'
Islands may In the future find common
ground In America's new Oriental posses

as of the other mineral resources of those

fields are among the many scattered all
over the world which contain large future
possibilities for the comparatively new in

one of the latest and best works on the
subject, .published In London in 1896 by the
distlngulsned chemist. Boverton Redwood
there is this account of the occurrence of
petroleum in the Islands:
"In the Island of Cebu there are con
siderable surface Indications and two
wells have been drilled to a moderate
depth. Oil was obtained in both but
from the second it flowed continuously
and much gas was emitted. The oW aas
found by Mr. Warren to have a specie

which the author received from Mr. War
ren, Is of brown color, with some fiuores
cence and disagreeable odor and at com
mon temperature is tilled with crystals of
solid hydrocarbons. The strata In which
the oil occurs have been much upheaved.
Mr. Warren believes that If the course of
the oil-bearing formation Is at all regular
petroleum will be found In other islands
of this s?roupâ viz.. In Lelte a:. Roho!. to

Annual Entertainment of Golden Gate
Lodge No. 6 Crowds the Colum
bia Theaterâ The Par
ticipants.
One of the best entertainments pre
sented to the public in months was that
given by Golden Gate Lodge No. 6. Be
nevolent and Protective Order of Elks,
yesterday afternoon in the Columbia The
ater. The playhouse was crowded to the
doors with the friends and members of
the organization. The audience m as ap
preciative and repaid with loud applause
the artist! who volunteered their services.
The programme was a varied and In- j
teresting one. occupying the attention of
those present fcr two arid a half hours.
Harry Connors aeu-d as stage director
and proved an efficient one. In the at- j
stnee of Henry H. Davis, who was too i
ill to appear and deliver the address of I
welcome, it devolved on Mr. Connors to j
do the speech making. He gave a short
history of the lodge, told of its good and
unostentatious work in the cause of tne '
sick and the distressed; of its readiness
to care for the families of brothers who
had been gathered by the grim reaper; |
Of its charity toward all men without re- i
pard to creed; of Its Justice, brotherly '
love aii'l hdelity. and lastly, of the bene
fits to be derived by membership.
At the conclusion of Mr. Connors' re
marks, Blum's orchestra rendered some
popular music. This was followed by a
fancy dar.ee by La Murielita. who pi
rouetted around tlie stage in an interest- '
Ing fashion. Baby Dcdy Schultz as usual j
captivated the audience with her singing |
ami dancing. Prank Bart the bary
tono. scored a hit. Although suf- !
fering with a sprained ankle. he !
consented to participate and charmed
his auditors with some rag-time
songs. Had not the Mage manager called J
a halt, it !s believed that Barton would i
be singing yet. Pearl Hlckman and two
oth*r Tittle tots did some graceful cake
walking. Miss Julia Cotte won deserved
ap;>lauee by her sweet rendition of
"Every Rose Must Have Its Thorn."' ;
"Dutch" Walton proved an exceptionally ;
clever musical genius and contributed to t
the enjoyment of the entertainment. Ma
rie D. Wood sang "The Lass From the
County Mayo" with feeling: Walter Par
ker rendered a few Irish sonns and gave \
a thrilling description of a norse race;
Seymour and Moll gave a horizontal bar i
performance which promised great things, '
but one of the guy ropes parted and the j
act was cut short in Its infancy: the great i
Elwood. the n;a!e soprano, sang a love j
ditty and received a beautiful bouquet i
froni an admirer; Florine Juillerat sang ,
"Life's Lullaby." accompanied on the pi- ,
ano by Mrs. Charles Poulter; William j
Murphy and Lydia Raymond did a re- .
flr.ed comedy art and Ada Sweeney sang
some beautiful songs.
A beautifully printed programme was j
presented to each seat holder as a souve
nir of an afternoon of music and song i
under the auspices of Golden Gate Lodge.
Kicked by a Horse.
Thomas Wyman. who resides at 4123
Twenty-fourth street, was severely In
jured yesterday by receiving a kick from
a horse. Wyman. who Is employed by
Gray Hros. at their stone quarry on

FINE ENSEMBLE WORK
BY MINETTI QUARTET
Second Chamber Music Concert of the
Season Attracted Another Large
Audience.
The first duty of a chamber music quar
tet Is to give a smooth rendition of the
best works, and In addition It should ed
ucate the musical public In the newer
works, so that one may keep In touch with
all compositions of prominence. 'I;.* Mi
nettl Quartet has so far adhered to tttese
principle*, and because of this fact alone
It is entitled to considerable praise. The
novelty at Friday's concert wai the
Cesar Frank piano quintet in F minor.
This Is a very ambitious piece of work
Classic In its character and of a very
timber quality, It becomes somewhat te
dious to the layman. The first move
ment especially is very long-winded last-
Ing almost twenty minutes. lam onÂ« of
those unfortunate musical enthusiasts
who like to tell the truth, and in order
to adhere to this bad habit of mine I
must confess that the Frank quintet
bores me. It Is all very true that the
music Is exquisite and of a very good
quality, but there Is absolutely nothing
interesting In it. Now and then a little
thunder awakens you from your slumber
but otherwise It Is absolutely devoid of
brilliancy. The quartet gave it an ex.
cellent reading, paying strict attention
to interpretation, and Otto Bendlx with
his fine touch and fluent technlc exe
cuted the piano part with the Judgment
of the mature musician.
Giullo Mlnettl demonstrated the fact
that he Is a violin virtuoso of superior
ability by rendering Bach's "Chacon
with remarkable dexterity. I hard!v
think there has ever been anything com.
posed which contains more technical ac
robatics than this very "Chaconne " and
I further may add that there Is hardly
a more difficult composition for the violin
In existence. To overcome all these neck
or rather finger-breaking, passages the
skill of a finished artist is required ' And
I cannot pay Mr. Mlnettl a better compli
ment than by asserting that he did full
Justice to this extremely difficult work
The quartet was at its best in the
Dvorak string quartet In !â¢' major. Espe
cially effective were the second and third
movements. The shading in this number
was simply sublime, and thÂ» pianissimo
passages were rendered with a delicacy
of execution and preclseness of attack
that sent the chills of admiration up
and down the spinal column of every true
musician In the hall.

Since the wreck of the barkentlne Jane
A. Falkenburg and the rescue of her crew
by the steamer Walla Walla, shipping
men are beginning to get very anxious
about the overdue fleet of coasters. The
arrival of the schooner Mildred E from
Seattle yesterday with a load of lumber
afur a thirty-one days' passage gave &
ray of comfort to the owners of vessels
bound this way. but in the case of ships
overdue at Pus. Sound her arrival is |
not reassuring, as the wind that brought '
the schooner in through the Golden Gate
should have favored -the Sound vessels.
The schooner Challenger is now out I
thirty days from Tacoma for San Fran
cisco and the schooner Amethyst thirty- \
two days from Tillanv ok for San Fran- :
cisco. The latter schooner was supplied
with provisions by one of the coasting
steam.*:- about a week go and a 1 that
time all aboard were Well Captain Er-.
.ratt of the Mildred E reports a icces-'
slon of southeast K:ilts o:Â» the way down
the coa**t. On a number of occasions the
vessel had to be hove to. A tremendous
*ea was running and some Of the crew of
the schooner had narrow escapes from
the seas that broke over her. The Chal
lenger and Amethyst are probably hav
ing the same kind of weather aj.a may be
heard from now it any time.
Among the vessels overdue on the
Sound from Ban r ranciS4 o are the barks
Ferris S: Thompson and Highland Light
and the schooner American Girl. The
Thompson left here for Departure Bay in
command of Captain Murk and the Amer
ican Girl in command of Captain Koss tor
Port Gamble on October 8. while the
Highland Light, in command of Captain
Herbert, left here for Departure Bay on
October 11. None of these vessels have
been heard from since, yet the ship Co
lumbia made the run to Seattle in live
days and the B. P. Cheney, which left
here on October 8. has been to the Sound,
discharged and loaded again and Is now
eighteen days out on bar way to Hono
lulu.
Fears were entertained for the old bark
Germania. which left here on October 19
for Seattle, but she reached port a few
days ago. She was carried north by the
southeasters and had to beat her way
back. The overdue vessels were also
probably carried past Flattery, but sea
taring men think they ought to have got
back before now, and seem to think there
1* some danger of their having gone on
Vancouver Island.
The Ferris S. Thompson, American Girl
and Highland Light are all old timers.
The Thompson was built at Setauket. N.
J.. In 1874 and is 480 tons net burden, 141.3
feet long. 32 feet beam and 17 feet deep.
The American Girl was built at Port Lud
low, Wash., in 1575, and is *v tons net
burden. 11VÂ».4 feet long. ;;1.4 feet beam, and
9.S â  Â»-â¢ deep. The Highland Light was
built at Bath, Main. in 1*74. and is 1179
tons net burden, 1H.9 feet long. 25.1 feet
beam and 24.3 feet deep. All three vessels
have been for years in the coasting trade.
The German ship Theodor, which ar
rived from London yesterday \la Honolu
lu, had i very rough experience. During
the month of September she was caught
in a territlc Htorm. during 'which she lost
the fore topgallant mast, main topmast
and Jib boom. Nearly a whole suit of
sails were blown to ribbons, and the ves
sel looked almost a wreck aloft when
Honolulu was reached on September 2Â».
Captain Arfmann bad a great deal of
trouble in getting spars for his vessel at
the Islands, and it was not until October
31 that a fresh start could be made for
San Francisco. The run from Honolulu
was made in twenty days, but she was
nearly eight months coming from London.
The Theodor's full story came up from
the Islands early in October and was
printed in The all at the time.
There was an unusual lot of activity on
the Government wharf yesterday. Dou- ,
ble gangs of men were at work loading I

refusal of the captain to discipline the
cook the meals were not fit to eat. Lumps

V. SHAKESPEARE AS A TRAGIC
POET.
Shakespeare'" tragedies are profoundly
religious, as all true tragedy must ever
be. Aristotle long ago. working upon the
masterpiece* of Greek tragic art, declared !
the ends of tragedy to be the excitation
of pity and fear In the spectator und a
consequent moral uplifting. Ten Brink j
has well pointed out that "pity" <or com- |
passion) carries with It as a coro!!ary [
"tragic fear." Now. pity spring" from the i
feeling that the subject of our compassion !
suffers beyond his deserts, is to a greater
or less degree a victim of circumstance. Â«
over which he hjJFno control. "Poetic !
Justice" <or ideal Justice, th* character^- !
tic of epic poetry), by which everybody !
gets his deserts, the good being saved and !
the wicked confounded. Is directly and I
fundamentally opposed to the tragic Idea]
The satisfaction men feel In the firt^h- i
ment of the wrongdoer leaves no place for
compassion, unless perchance, a? often
happens In these latter day*, we shift our i
point of view and think of him as an irre- j
sponsible victim of hereditary or acquired j
tendencies. No doubt this shift of
view baa Introduced much confusion Into j
the critical Judgments of our time; but we
should not lose sight of the principle that â 
we pity only when we recognize real or
fancied injustice.
In tragedy, then, we are brought fare to
face with the moat profound mystery of
our mortal state. the prevalence of un- !
merited suffering. Men seek and have !
sought In vain to pry Into this mystery.
A whole system of theology has been built
up on the assumption that we suffer for

explanation may be attempted, the awful

for what they are not Individually to
blame. Religion has Its home In this mys
tery. This mystery becomes a touchstone
by which men are separated Into two
KrÂ»at classes. One man. with sublime
faith, submits himself to the divine order
â"Let come on me what will â¢ â¢ â¢
Though He slay m. . yet will I tru3t in
Him"; while another stands In open re
bellion or sullen silence. In this differ
ence, a mystery In Itself, lies the whole
secret of the religious attitude of men.
We somehow think of the attitude of Job
as the nobler of the two. Compassion for
the" Borrows of men and submission to the
divine will are the highest reaches of the
human spirit; and it is precisely these ef
fects that Aristotle Â»aw In the master
pieces of Greek tragedy. In Sophocles
and Aeschylus we find the noblest concep
tions of the Greek religion.
-Fall not In aught that is right.

Ing with fainting heart his last encounter
with Iniquity ami treachery and wrong,
we hear him cry. "If it be now, 'tis not
to come; If It be not to come. it win be
now; if It be not now. yet It will come;
the readiness Is all." And In this cry we
seem to hear the very voice of the mighty
poet himselfâ "the readiness is all.'"
Owing to the absence of authentic de
tails as to Shakespeare's life and charac
ter the question has been much mooted
as to how far his plays furnish materials
for a history of his moods and of his cun
fictions, On this point there van never
I > entire agreement. And yet. admitting
Â»8 we do the danger and the folly of doc
matizlng on ih..-t* mutter*, a caret vi sx
amlnatlon of the plays in the ordÂ«?r of
their production (an order now well es
tablished for the most part) makes it dif
ficult to resist the conclusion that between
the ages of 36 and 45 Shakespeare pussed
through a period of deep spiritual an
gulEh. To this period belong the qr-m
tragedies, from "Julius Caesar" to "Corl
olanus." and the biting satirical comedies
A comparison of these with the latest
group, written probably after his return
to Stratford, reveals to us a man wno
fought his way through the valley of De
spond to the serene, atmosphere of the
heights beyond.
All pains the immortal spirit must endure.
All weakness which Impairs, all griefs which
bow.
Find their sole speech In that victorious brow.
The central characteristic of every real
drama Is conflict. On the one hand there
must be a person (or persons) to be en
tangled, and over against these stands he
entangling agency. In the first group Is
found the hero, or heroine, or both he
center of our Interest and sympathy on
the other side we find the hostile agency
or agencies, natural or supernatural seek
ing to thwart or destroy. In tragedy this
conflict must be of such a kind that the
hero can find no escape from the toils
Step by step we see him crowded to the
brink where he Is to be finally engulfed
As before indicated, the conflict must
be unequal from the start In order that
the proper ends of tragedy may be rasJ
1/.' 1 compassion and religious awe The
character and condition of the hero must
be such that we can feel kinship with him
In his sorrows and defeat, can see in the
fatal struggle the ruin of a typical hu
man life, a ruin to which we ourselves
might be subject if thus mysteriously be
set. The hero too. must be a person to
excite general Interest, always one of
come reputo In the social or political
world. While wo cannot say that this lÂ»
an Invariable law <wttmt.* George Eliot's
succesa with the "Weaver of Raveloe").
the fact remain* that thus far no great
tragedy has aj.pi-arnJ Jn which the hero
was drawn from the humb!Â» or obscure
walk* of life. Furthermore, th" hero
must be a ptrson of essentially noble na
ture; otherwi?e we should fetl satisfac
tion at hi* overthrow, not compassion.
Play* of the tvp* of "Kit-hard 111" or
"The- lew of Malta" do not fall Into the
same class with "Hamlet." "Macbeth"
nnd "Lear." They are not trnodies in
the Aristotelian senÂ«e. It has !(Â»-t.n sug

This style of criti

utterly subversive of

ends of tragic art. 1:
proceeds upon th#Â»
false assumption
that there nuift bo

misfortune and mor
al delinquency, whereas Â«â â¢ know
that calamity sometimes follows
Â«UmjÂ« â upon t J$e â d.^d* â <tf â the â
blest heroism. Aristotle defined thÂ»
tragic hero a? "a person of great reputa
falling Into adversity, no* thrmiirh wlrk
edness, but through some errnr." Thl*
tragic "error" Is not necessarily a moral
fault at all (witness the ra*e of Anti
gone), and. indeed, never affords an
adequate cause for the catastrophe, m
far as human eye ran see see. As a mat
ter of prudential wisdom It Is well to re
member that as we k>>w so also shall w*
rÂ»-ap, but it 1m none the Ir*.-Â« true that w<Â»
often reap where we have not nown. One
man soweth and another reapeth. Shakes
peare was too great nn artist, as well a*
too great a thinker, to attempt to rarns
ure the Infinite In terms of the finite. anÂ«l
so he leaves the tangled web of hum.in
responsibilities and perplexities and suf
ferings with no attempt to unmvel it.
He pictures It all for us most vividly In
a great variety of forms, nnd we may In
terpret as each has eye 3 to see or ears
to hear.
Certain it Is thit not all render* will
see and feel alike In contemplating this
realm of dramatic art. any more thnn
they will see alike In contemplating th*
real world of men and women about
them. M. f (ruet has recently published
a work on the drnm.n shnwlnr much
knowledge and acuteness of n kind. in
which he holds that men's fondness for
trade representations Is a survival of
the gorilla or savage stateâ "a primitive
anil depraved fondness for cruel spec
tacles. We have no doubt that his con
tention will commend Itself to som*Â»
mind". but that the great works of
Sophocles nnd ShakeÂ«p.Â«ar*Â» can NÂ» thui
simply disposed of Â»c shall not believe.
On this point we prefer Ten Brink to M.
FaKuet.
In trentlnc Â«f PhnkeÂ«r>e.ire an â  traffic

thÂ«Â» fundamental question of the sig
nificance or meaning of his work. In
Htemry study tbe point of view Is of
first Importance, Shnke^pÂ«are's method In
detail, his plot structure, character de
velopment, stage effectsâ nil fruitful
themesâ are left for future treatment In
connection with the study of a particular
play.

MORNING GAME.
Sacramento 3. San Francisco 0.
The series of oxtra-inrlng tie games be
tween Sacramento and San Francisco re
celved a destructive shock yesterday
morning when both tearan met on the
Recreation grounds diamond for the last
of their league engug<ments. When the
game was concluded the Senators added
hi. other victory tv their Ul und the local
iilne went back a notch that puts them
hors de combat for championship honors.
Hit i were plentiful *nÂ»>ug-h and hits
scarce. Four glittering jukulcs by each
team generated a bit of interest among
the few people who made the most of a
Sabbath morning to watch the leaders
cavort on the diamond. Harper itched
an excellent game, allowing only three
hits and striking out suven men. Fitz
patrlck's performance was not of such
fine quality, Fix hits and throe men struck
out being his record.
The fcame was won by the Senators in
two innings. In the third Harper lined
out a hit to left field and went to second
on a blocked ball. A sacrifice gave him
third base ajid an honest single by O'Con
nor Â»<â !]â¢. him skating over the rubber.
In the lifth Inning Harper waÂ« given a
base on b*dlr and purloined second. Then
Kugan found the ball and a LÂ»*onld phot
to right Held was the signal for Harper
to bcore. Harvey, who was on the BTSt
tag at this time, four tails giving him
that position, kept coursing the bags and
be scored br Sullivan's failure to stop
the throw in.
San Francisco had a full quota of men
on the bags during the game, but was
unable to ?<Tid a man to the haven of
rest. The score Is:

CADETS AND SPARTANS
MEET ON MUDDY FIELD
TWO-THIRDS of the Junior eleven of Company I?,
League of the Cross Cadets, beat three-fourths of
the Spanish Pleven at Presidio Athletic grounds yes
terday In a timely contested and sloppy came of
football. There were no casualties, notwithstanding
that Caesar de Cazanettl, a substitute on the Spartan
team, fell through one of the. numerous bottomless bogs
on the field during the last half of the game. It requiring
the combined efforts of both teams and Police Officer
Hylanii to get him back again to the tiring line.
Not more than half â  hundred enthusiasts broke thHr
way through the North Beach zephyrs to witness the
game, nor for that matter neither did much more than
half of the players, halt a dozen of them uaving i.-waie
bs*ck from Stockton earlier In the day in a badly over
trained condition. A half dozen substitutes were rung in,
however, and though the teams lacked In numbers, the.
pame lacked nothing of snappiness, even if it was all one
way.
The Cadet eleven had the kick-off in the first half
and kept the ball well In their opponents' territory until

Spartans cot the ball shortly after matters opened up
again, and by a bunch of mass plays were crowding
things well down toward the Cadet line when Cazanettl
kicked "Silver" Woodman in the lid. and half a dozen
volunteers were compelled to drag him to a nearby mud
puddle to souse him back to consciousness. Then the
Cadets took the ball again and Beasley got It round the
left end for another touchdown, giving thÂ« Cadets a score
of eleven.
In the second half the Spartans borrowed a man from
the Cadets, and Woodman having the kickoff, they kept
the ball a few feet nearer the coal of their opponents,
and they had a chance for a touchdown until Ahren
got the ball again and set it on the other side of the line.
1-att-r he took it across for .1 touchdown, but failed at
the goal. vii. Spartans got into play again and were for
a time within reaching distance, and probably would
have madÂ« it but for < Uanettl, who got tangled up with
"Hairy" MeAvoy, the timekeeper, at a critical moment.
As a result of it Cazanettl plumped Into a convenient
â lough and stranded on â  mud Hat on the far side. After
he had been Ashed out Officer Hyland called the game on
account of darkness. The score was 16 to 0.

RIFLE RECORD BROKEN.
F. O. Young of the Columbia
Club Sets Another High
Score.
The world ten-shot rifle record on the
Columbia target was broken yesterday by
F. O. Young of the Columbia Pistol and
Rifle Club at the regular meeting on Â»he
Harbor View range. He made M points
in ten shots in the Qllndemann'i all
comers' rille m<-Â«lal match, beating the rec
ord of 35. held by A. H. Pan since last
December. The best the Eastern SDOtS
have reached Is S9 on this target. Young's
Individual shots were 3, â *. â¢:. I, 6. 4, 3, 2.
1â34. This shows a 3 2-5-Inch aver
age. The shooting was offhand at
IN yards with target rifle. The strnin
was great v.hen he realized that he had a
chance of breaking the record, but for
all that held steady, getting better results
with each shot. Young's last bull- wan
placed in the Inch center and he
railed the result before the marker put
up the bullseye flag.
It Is believed that this score will give
him the Glindcmann medal, on which
I'npe had the call up to yesterday.
Another remarkably good score was
made by C. M. Dalss wl%h the pistol on
the fifty yard target range. In ten snms
he made 31 rolnts In the following order
of shots, 3, ... .'.. 3, l. 3, 4, 2. 4. Iâ3l. it
will be noticed that he too wound up "bet
ter than he began. Among the otner
good scores were H. Steven* 23. and |> r
J. F. Twist 27. with a small rifle, and a'
Dorrell. 49. with the big rifle at 200 yard/
The best re-entry scores were as follows

Schools.
DR. BAUME MAKES HIS REPORT
VISITED AMERICA FOR THE
COLLEGE COUNCIL.
He Gives a Glowing Account of the
System of Accredited Schools
and Recommends Its
Adoption.
BERKELEY An antipodean
of California is
contained it. t: â¢ mads by F. E.
Baume. LL B :.t meeting
of the I Council at
N 7. . as printed in tht Auck
land Star of October 7.
Mr. Baume visited the United States last
Eummer as a commissioner of the Univer
sity College Council to study American
university methods and ideais. He vis
ited Berkeley on his return Journey to
New Zealand and was greatly struck with
the organization and methods of the Uni
versity of California. He spent a num
ber of days at the university under the
guidance of Professor J. Henry Senger
and Director A. 1 >. Laus< hner of the Stu
dents' Observatory.
The dutits of the president of the uni
versity .-truck Mr. Baume as a particu
larly good feature of the American uni
versity system. "The president of the
university." says his report, "is responsi
ble for the entire teaching and adminis
tration of the university, and is chosen
rather for his reputation as an [minis.
tratur than as a scholar. To him is in
trust* for all practical purposes the ap
pointment of the members of the teach
, ing faculty. He seeks tO gather around
\ him men of mark in the various branches
cf learningâ by such means attracting
) students to the universityâ and endeavors
to give it a high position ln the educa
tional world. It will be seen, therefore,
how the standing of such a university
depends largely upon the personality of
its president.
"The University of California is an in
tegral part of the public educational sys
tem of the State, and as such It completes
the work done in the public school."
Mr. Baume commends the system of ac
crediting secondary schools, by which, he
says. thÂ»? educational interests of the
! State are knit closely together and the.
; quality of the work done in the secondary
1 schools Is Improved.
"The power thus given," he says, "is
carefully exercised by the principal of the
accreJitcl school, for the career of the
, student so recommended reflects on his
i school anJ Is. to some extent, a criterion
of the work dor.r thereat and the tltnesa
or otherwise of the school to remain upon
the accredited list, a distinction which is
of moment to all schools and of actual
monetary value to private schools."
Mr. Uaume applies the conclusion
which he has drawn from the University
of California in recommendations con
cerning the adaptability of these methods
to conditions in New Zealand. He speaks
admiringly of the general Interest taken
in California in the extension of univer
sity education, which results, he says, "in
making private gifts stupendous."
His admiration for the system of accred
ited schools is shown by the fact that he
recommends for the institution in New
Zealand a system of Inspection, examina
tions and accredited schools similar to
that which Is In vogue In California. He
says further that some provision should
be made to introduce the university ex
tension system, such as prevails In Cali
fornia. Before a subsequent meeting of
the University College Council Mr. Baume
made a report upon the astronomical work
of the University of California. While in
Berkeley he declared that the Lick Ob
servatory was unequaled in the world
and that the Students' Observatory at
Berkeley was a mHlti institution.

HUNTING TRIP
THAT FINISHED
DISASTROUSLY
Drowning of James
Mulqueeney.
Oakland Offlcc San Francisco Call.
Nov. 19.
A young hunt- r. whOM name is sup
111 1 be Jan-. | :;ng at
tilfornia rtreet.fi
.ir..wned in the bay oft B street, n- ar Em
eryville, under rather peculiar circum
stances this afurn->on.
Harmon Levy, aged 18 years, residing at
ZYA visadero street. San Francisco, was
the dead man's companion and that he
survived to relate the story la wholly due
to the prompt and timely action of G. Jen
sen and H. C. Olson, both residing on Et
ta street, this city. Their attention was
attracted to young Levy, floundering be
side an ovcrturnt-d boat a considerable
distance from the shore at the foot of B
street, by two unknown boys playing near
the water.
Jensen and Olson Immediately secured a
rowboat and went to Levy's rescue. They
found the lad in an exhausted condition
yet clinging desperately to the overturned
boat. When brought ashore and revived
Levy stated that he and a young man
whom he believes to be Muiqueenty had
come over from San Francisco this after
noon on a hunt. trip. Somewhere- near
Emeryville they nad hired a light boat.
They had not been out on the water long
when the deceased wishing to relieve
Levy at the oar*, arose to change his seat.
In doing so he had disturbed a gun lying
across two seats. Apparently the gun was
cocked and his trouser leg brushing
roughly against it set it oft. and the load
â¢â : shot blew a hole through the side of
the boat Just below the water line.
"We tried to plug up the hole." said
young Levy, "but couldn't succeed very
well, and the water kept rushing in. so
one tried to bail out water, while the
other rowed as hard as possible, but it
was no use. Soon the boat started sink-
Ing and all there was left for us to do was
to get out. turn her over and hold on un
til some one could see us and come to
save us.
"For a long time we hallooed with all
our might. Presently my friend slipped
off exhausted. Finally he only clung to
one of my legs. Tin: he got too weak and
sank out of sight. I tried to continue to
call for help, but was also too weak and
1 had about given up all hope of being
saved when those two gentlemen came
nut In a boat and rescued me. I was in
the water at least an hour."
As to the identity of the deceased Levy
says that he was atred about 21 years; he
was Inclined to be stout; was red-haired,
and was employed in a San Francisco
plumbing shop. Levy had been hunting
with him before, but he had never learned
his true name. Ho said the trip that
proved so disastrous had been planned
only yesterday In the plumbing shop
where deceased was employed.
The body of the drowned young man has
not been recovered.
Jan Mulqueeney. father of the victim,
residing at 3412 California street, offers
$100 reward for the recovery of his son's
body.

MUCH GOLD IN SIBERIA.
Dimitri Evanov Tells of a New Klon-
dike in the North.
At the Palace, a route to his home, is
Dimitri Evanov. a Russian scientist,
who has been spending the last five years
In Siberia studying the geology and
mineralogy of the country for the infor
mation of the Imperial Government at St.
Petersburg.
Mr. Evanov is enthusiastic In the ex
treme concerning the future of Siberia,
particularly that portion of It from
Vladivostok north. He says the country
is teeming with mineral wealth that
needs merely the hand of enterprise to
develop it and create on the Asiatic side
of the Bering Sea and Arctic Ocean a
rival of the famous Klondike.
While the country is not adapted for
farming or agricultural pursuits it i.<
immensely rich in minerals, particularly
gold, which can either be washed from
the placers of the numerous rivers or
mined from the hills farther in the in
terior.
These pursuits, he thinks, if once prop
erly entered upon, would naturally at
tract thousands of people and become
the means of adding various business en
terprises to the industry of mining, which
enterprises would be very materially
helped by the completion of the Siberian
railway by being brought Into quick and
direct touch with the various capitals of
Europe.
While the foregoing i* the account tnat
Mr. Evanov gives of his mission to Si
beria and his presence In this city, it is
whispered that the real object of his b-.ing
here is quite different.
For some time past it has been known
that there were several agents '"f the
Siberian Hailroad in the United States
looking for a Pacific Coast terminal for
their vessels which are to run out of
Port Arthur. Mr. Evanov. it is paid,
is one of these and his business here . - to
look at the facilities San Francisco has
to offer, as he has already looked into the
merits of Puget Sound ports He will
also examine the claims of San Diego.
He leaves to-morrow for the East,
where he is said to be going to arrange
for transcontinental railroad connections
and for steamship connections across the
Atlantic. â¢â â¢; 'â -:
QUEER DISAPPEARANCE.
An Injured 807 of Whom No Trace

17 years of age. disappeared from his
hÂ«>me in this city, and. though his pa
rents made every effort to trace him. his
whereabouts could not be found.
Yesterday there appeared in ThÂ«Â» CÂ»S
an account of a ><~>ung man of r.he same
name being injured in a machine shop in
Oakland and being taken to the city hos
pital 'or treatment.
The parents of the missing Cappers read
the account and at once went over to see
!if the injured youth was their son. Ar
1 riving at the hospital, they wer
that the patient had been removed to the
home of J. Hunsell. at *$4 Thirty-fourth
street. They went to the address piven
them, but there to their surprise learned
that Cappers had been taken to the in
firmary-
From the house they traveled to the in
firmary, only to learn that no person of
that name was there or had been ad
mitted at any time. Additional inquiries
' brought no further information, and to
day the search will be continued and the
lad found if he has not vanished

IMPORTED MOSQUITOES.
London Has Â£xperienced Her First
Visitation of the Pest.
For â¢he first time probably since Eng
land was a savage land the country 1*
threatened with a mosquito plague. And
this, unfortunately. Is not for a year or
a summer, but forever; for. as travelers
and naturalists know, when once the
mosquito obtains a hold It requires ef
forts more than human to dislodge It
The most curious fact about the mos
quito Invasion is that London Is one of
the first places to be attacked. Any one*
who understands the temperament of the*
mosquito knows that a very successful
requisite to its existence is pure tlr.
Indeed, the sole preventive from at
tacks In foreign countries is a copious
supply of smoke. Yet. maybe, the mos
quito, in settling upon this particular
spot, has paid a compliment to the id
ministration, and has decided that
London is not such a terr; smoky
place to live in after all.
A more satisfactory explanation, how
ever. Is that the mosquito, which Is no
traveler, has merely taken up his
quarters where he landed, and is gradual
ly spreading abroad from that particular
spot. And that brings .- to the origin
in Englind of th<Â» pernicious pests. I
have been told severally that they, or
the germs, says a correspondent, cam*
with fruit from South Africa or South
America, with plants from the continent
and in timber from Canada. The. speci
mens I have seen in London exactly
resemble :n size and other features the
Canadian mosquito, and one might go
still further and suggest that mosquito
germs, and even the Insects themselves,
have existed in this country since
Canadian timber was first Imported, ami
>-et have nÂ«-\er made their pretence ob
jectionable until now. when. In larger
numbers, they have become acclimatized
and spread abroad about their nefarious
work.â London Mail.
A DIAMOND IN HIS NIGHTSHIRT
How Plucky Pete McDonald Amused
Himself in a Seattle Hospital.
Pete McDonald, th- brother of Alex Mc-
Donald, the millionaire king of the Klon
dike, left the Seattle hospital a few week.**
ago. having been detained there nlnÂ«
weeks with a broken leg. Pete McDonald,
though not so well known as his brother.
Is rich, nevertheless, and when he vlilte.i
Portland last winter he spread hi* money
freely as befits a generous Klondlker.
At the hospital beside Pete's bed on a
stand was some |3O) In C gold pieces.
With these he amused himself, stacking
them up and building little heaps to while
away the time. For hours he would lie
there. lovingly fingering his gold pl-ces.
But the funniest feature of all wu the
fact that Pete Insisted on wearing a ISO
diamond In the bosom of his night Â«hirt.
The diamond wa.Â« as big a.Â« the end of
one's thumb, and Its glittering rayÂ« seem
ed to comfort Pete as he toyed with if in
his hours of pain. Every night the mil
lionaire would fasten the diamond In the
bosom of his night shirt before going to
sleep.
The accident to McDonald which result
ed In th*Â» loss of hi* limb occurred last
April. Win he wan starting for th*
north he fell off the train a* It wm leav
ing the depot at Seattle. One leg Â«v
broken. The surgeons tried to save the
member, but it could not be done. Mc-
Donald impatiently took to hi* bed ami
the limb was amputated. He had scarce
ly recovered enough strength to travel.
and hi* amputated limb was In bad shape,
when he insisted on srettln* up and start-
Ing for the north to attend to busines*.
He Journeyed to Dawson and suffered
torture* that would have killed ordinary
men without his power* of endurance.
When he returned he had to go back to
the hospitnl. where he was treated over
two months before he wag in fit condi

Electricity in the Kitchen.
When the cook in the saloon at Sixth
street and Lucas avenue touched tha
water pipe one day recently the cus
tomers before the bar heard a scream of
pain and fright. Then a splash as of the
falling of much water was heard, and
then there were more screams. Finally a.
rapid tattoo was beat on the floor, and
the cook, a woman, appeared, the per
spiration pouring down her face.
"I have been shocked." she said.
"Everything is full of it."
When the proprietor of the saloon.
George Herchler. walked back Into the
kitchen and started toward the faucet he
began to dance. A man who followed htm
gave a correct Imitation of how not to
approach the throne and came Jumptng
back. The floor was charged with elec
tricity. The pipe* were doubly charged.
The sink was full of the "power." When
this fact was fully established a message
was sent to the super vis 1 of the city
lighting. Andrew J. O'Reilly, who reached
the place about 3:30 o'clock and pro
ceeded to Investigate the trouble. When
he walked on the wet floor of the kitchen,
which had Just been scrubbed, he felt th*
shock. He touched the faucet with rub
ber-gloved" hands and put a tester upon
the two pipes, and found that a current of
over 50) volts was running through the
pipes, and in surprise asked If the roolr
had been burned by touching the pipe.
Fortunately she had barely touched the
Iron and so escaped. Otherwise she would
have been seriously burned.
Superintendent O'Reilly found that the
wires of the Laclede Power Company hud
been run through a pipe and the Insula
tion had worn out. He cut the wire run
ning into the cellar and the trouble was
ended. Fortunately neither of the wires
was grounded "and a serious accident was
averted.â St. Louis Globe-Democrat.

company opened Us engagement. In
truth, a great many people had to be
turned away. But because the play Is an
old one It must not be understood that
the performance Is lacking any novelty.
On the contrary, there are a few special
ties that pleased the large audience Im
mensely, and encores were accorded In
plenty. Of course there are particularly
two characters . who carry the play
through, namely. Yon Yonson and Mrs.
Laflln. The former was essayed In a
most satisfactory manner by Arthur
Donaldson. whoÂ«e vocal selections added
considerably to the general attractiveness
of this role, and it cannot be denied that
he has become a distinct favorite. The
Irish character was In the hands of An
ni<* Mack Berleln, who, In appearance as
well as execution, gave a decidedly clever
portrayal of this part. The wholesome
humor of the lines were brought out with
unctuous tijilrit. and the laughers cannot
say that tfioy wasted their time at the
California last evening. The specialties
by Edith Hall, the lumbermen's quartet,
contesting of Clinton Maynard, Henry
Hubbard, Loon Parnett and Sidney Cra
ven, and those of Grace Hazzard were all
greatly enjoyed. As to the acting, Guy
Spangler's John Hollowuy could easily
take a vacation without any one missing
him. This was about one of the most
un and dis graceful exhibitions of acting
peon at the California for some time. If
there Is anything inexcusable in an actor
It is stiffness, and of this Mr. Spangler
possesses an overdose. The show as a
whole Is worth seeing.
The melodramatic element of our thea
aters had a great old time at the Alham
bra last evening, when "In Old Ken
tucky " brought reminiscences of the good
times at the Howard-street temple of art.
The gallery kÂ»kN held high carnival
and punctuated particularly enthusiastic
Dasagas with that unearthly noise so
uenr to the actors' ears. If any one got
his moneys worth It was the gallery god.
From a melodramatic standpoint the per
formance was exquisite. There was plenty
of blood and thunder and some clever
epecialtles. The realism was adhered to,
even as to the introduction of real live
horses. Verllv Morosco's old stand-bys
have at last round a theater after their
own heart, and they will prove their
faithfulness to their favorite plays by
crowding the Alhamb'ra all of tnis week.
The Orpheum bill is very attractive this
week. Ryan and Rltchfleld are exceed
ingly amusing in their funny sketch.
"The Lunatic's Hall." and Cora Stuart
and A Kearney appear in a very
g fan*- entitled "The Fair Eques
trienne." Little Mlgnon Is a tot who sings
Ishlngly well and dances still more
gracefully. Rice and Elmer bring down
the hou.Â«e with their grotesque comedy
an.l acrobatic slietch. "A Rube's Visit to
Chinatown." But the star of them all Is
Cornllle, whose popularity seems to know
.'.uls this week. The more you listen
t" i!.ls (.'lever singer the more you are
obliged to a.lmire her. The lines of her
pong are pictured In her brilliant eyes
and her fetching Intonation. No one who
ddisrhts In a really clever vaudeville turn
should miss to hear Cnrnllle.

HIS WOUNDS NOT FATAL.
James Ferris, Who Attempted to
Murder Charles Cuddy, Will
Recover.
James Ferris, an opium "fiend" who
attempted Saturday evening to murder
! James Cuddy, bartender In Charles John
son's saloon, "4.: Howard street, and was
seriously wounded by Cuddy, was resting
easy yesterday at the Receiving Hospital,
and the doctors thought he would recover
from his wounds.
The police are satisfied that Ferris' sole
reason for shooting at Cuddy was be
cause Cuddy had secured the position he
occupied. It is thought that if Johnson
had been in the saloon at the time Ferris
would have made the attempt upon him.
ns he had threaten* I to gel even with
Johnson for discharging him. The proba
bility is that the charge -of assault to
murder against Cuddy will be dismissed,
i as he shot in self-defense.

NED RILEY WILL
BE INDICTED BY
THE GRAND JURY
Straw-Bond Scandal
Revived.
HE MAY BE ARRESTED TO-DAY
POLICE HAVE LOCATED HIM
NEAR FRESNO.
Jury Has Been ProblÃg Into the
"Strangler" Wilson Case and Has
Decided That the Offenders
Should Be Punished.
Ned nilcy. the Â«Â»x-dcjÂ»uty Sheriff, who
was mixed up with ex-Police Court Clerk
Tommy KelUy In the straw-bond pcan
dal. Is to In* indicted by the Grand Jury.
An ot!ir*-r has already boon t-ent ti> Fresno
ti> lucato him. und it Is expected that he
will !â <â¢ on Ills way back to the scenes of
Lis troubles iK'li'rc to-night.
KlloyV %vhcr.'uWu*# -Â»lnÂ»-w h" left San
Franilsco ha* been a matter of specula
tion. tna\ fur that reason the fact that the
Grand Jury was Investigating his cape
w kept a profound McrcL. Word was
lia*>e<l, however, from the jury room
lo the Police l>Â«-purtnient that lilley was
R want M, and with the word went the hint
that tut soon as tie waa located und In the
clutches of an oXUcvr the jury would do
the rest.
It waÂ« feared that If the indictment was
brought before lilley was apprehended It
might leak Â«>ut and he would make the
most of the Information by increasing the
distance between himself and the San
Francisco authorities. The police have
lÂ«Â«n on thÂ«* lookout for information con
cerning Klley for mmc time, and yester
day leurnrd that ho was in the nelghbor
hiK>d of Fresno, where he will be arrested
to-day.
The Grand Jury will meet next Thurs
day, when, if everything is in proper
t-hape\ a true hill will be brought against
ltiley. If. however, he should object to
remaining in the custody of the police
until then a Fpecl.nl session will bf called
to accommodate him.
This Is nut the lirst time that Riley has
had experience with grand Juries In con
nect inn with the same case. The last
Grand Jury was dangerously near the in
dicting point, but a political pull wan
brought t<< bear nnd the disaster was
averted. Hiley was given time to make
himstlf scarci- and had not been heard of
since until The police located him yester
day. Tills time he is di-allng with a Jury
that may not bo led astray by the "pull."
The case which was the undoing of
Hll.y. forced Clerk Kt-11. y into disgrace
nnd gave Attorney J. N. E. Wilson con
siderable uneasiness was that of
"StrangJer" Wilson. Wilson was released
from jail on bonds with Kilev and At- ]
tcrney Wilson aa sureties. The bonds 1
were approved by Kelley. who was cog
nizant of the fart that Rlley was not |
worth the amount for which he qualltled 1
I und was well aware that the bonds hard
ly approached the materiality of straw.
The defendant lost no time in getting out
of town and <!M not appear for trial. He
was capttirod later at Santa Cruz and
brought ha.-k to this city. Before his
<-asÂ»Â» was heard in court he made a full
Mntf-mcnt of the method* of the straw
bond gjtng. His confession led to the
breaking up. to a certain degree, of the
practices.

fort to scoop all of th- furniture. Arrests
followed from this bit of enterprise.
The next move was to Mission street,
where Commander Moore wa.Â« arrested
for attempting to bite the arm off of a
doctor who vlÂ«ltÂ«-d him In an endeavor to
collect a bill for medical services. This di

â lon, and It In for acts committed at this
place that Moore Is liable to get Into his
moK BerioUH dllflculty.
The privates of his army havo lately
awakened to the belief that they have
been most beautifully and artistically
gulled. The Union Mission, which Is the
main graft of the army, deals In meals
and lodgings at cut rate prices. Moore
has worked upon the sympathy of a num
ber of merchants, who have been contrib
uting much of the provender he has been
disposing of at army headquarters. That
was all right, but when the privates
learned that their commander in chief had
been selling in- . 1 1 tickets and pocketing
the proceeds, without turning it Into the
general fund, thero was a howl followed
by a mutiny.
With his army gone Moore -was almost
out of business and to save himself tried
to recruit a new force. The following no
tice was posted on the front door of the
headquarters:
Evangelical workers wantln* work In pom*
organization apply to 4 Manning jilace. Fifty
â workers needed who are willing to WOT* on the
army lines. A. W. MOORB
Among those who were lured by the an

that have prompted the present police in

most horrible Â»>ccurrences in the army
headquarters, which. if their statements
are correct, stamp Moore as a moral de
generate who is not a safe person to be
at large In a decent community. The sto
ries told by these women are too frightful
in pome details to appear In print. Th-
claim that Moore is a human monster who
has thrived by preying on the gullible,
and will not hesitate at any offense to
gain his ends. From what they say It is
l<anKd that the man expects to be ar

money from his peculations to clear him :
of any charge that the police may bring

THE old monitor C"amanchA madÂ©
her first trip on the bay yesterday
as a collier. She was loaded with
black diamonds and towed over
to Oakland Creek. Strange to say, she
made her new departure within a
stone's throw of the place where she
made her debut as a United States
monitor more than thirty years ago.
The Camanche was built in Jersey
City by Peter Donahue-Â«f San Fran
cisco. H. Ryan, a pioneer of Humboldt
County, and Mr. Secor of New Jersey
in IM2. The parts were put together
temporarily, and then, when every
thing was seen to fit. they were taken
apart and loaded on the ship Aqullla,
The vessel arrived in San Francisco
November 10, 1563. and was docked at
Harrison-street wharf. A southeaster
came up and the Aqullla was sunk at
her moorings. Divers were sent out
from New York and the vessel was
raised. After that the parts of the
Camanche were taken to â ''â  place on
Berry street, between Third and
Fourth, and there put together. The
launching of the monitor was a public
holiday, and Miss Nellie Maguire, a
relative of Peter Donahue, christened
the vessel.
The launching of the collier Ca
manche was attended without any
ceremony. Her machinery, guns, tur
rets and armor were removed at the
Union Iron Works and in Oakland
Creek, and hoisting machinery put in
their place. As soon as the alterations
had been completed thÂ« collier went
nt once Into commission.

A NEEDED REST.
He Says It Was Providential That
Things So Arranged Them
selves to Furnish His
Successor.
>
Father York* was formally Installed
yesterday morning as the temporary pas
tor of the Church of St. Peter'B. The oc- ,
easlon called forth a larger conpreKatlon .
than usual and the church was packed
when Father Casey prepared to moke the
usual announcements. He then stated to
the congregation that the condition of his
health had been such for some time that
It was necessary for him to take a com
plete rest. Ho said he was glad that
Father York.- had been appointed, be
cnuse of the friendship that had long
existed between himself and that eloquent
divine Ho ppoko of Father Yorke's re
gard for St. Peter's, the Vatican of San
Francisco, ~.p named by Archbishop Ale
many, and raid that it was providential
that Father Torke was disengaged at the
time when it was necessary for himself to
go away. He felt that In bis absence
the parish would bo provided for in safe
bands.
"it is hardly necessary for mo to
acknowledge the kind words that Father
Casey has spoken." replied Father *â¢ rkÂ«
after ascending the pulpit. "Ever since
I came to San Francisco Father Casey
and the priests of St. Peter's have shewn
themselves kind, sincere friends. The peo
ple, also, have always been kindly dis
posed toward me and therefore 1 feel that
I am among friends.
"My ambition Is to follow in the foot
steps of Father Casey and if I shall suc
ceed In administering the parish In a
small way after his model l feel I shall
be doing very well. I hope with you all
that Father Casey will soon be restored to
health, to return and take his place,
among you."
Father Yorke then read the Epistle
and Gospel of the day. He spoke of the
small beginnings of the kingdom of Goo,
, how It was compared by the Lord to a
I mustard ret md to the leaven hidden In
1 the meal. He Inquired Into the reason of
' this growth and found It lirst In the
promts.- of God and secondly In the faith
and work, the charity and enduring nope
. of the Christian people.

enough to make un ordinary mind tremble.

Hamlet hesitates, for which he haÂ» been

WHO SHOULD BE
THE CAPTAIN OF
THE TRANSPORT
Interesting Question
of Authority.
CAPTAIN BUTLER BLUFFED
HAD TO GIVE UP HIS CABIN TO
THE QUARTERMASTER.
Dr. Giannini and Five Hospital Corps
Hen Volunteer to Care for
the Smallpox Pa
tients.
Tho old question of "Who Is boss?" Is
apt to make the voyage of the Pathan a
lively one before she reaches Manila.
There Is a quartermaster on board who
believes there li nothing In the way of
authority on the ship that can In any way
come up to his position, lie cannot navi-
Kate, nor does hr knew what to Â«lÂ»t L WBea
the weather picks up. but In nil own
estimation he commands the ship Just the
same.
Captain Detchmendy of the reÃular in
fantry was detailed by orders from deÂ»
partment headquarters as quartermaster
and commissary of 'the Pathan while on
her way westward. There la nothing in
this which includes supreme command,
and it is laid down in the instructions
furnished quartermaster! by Colonel
Long that they must not interfere with
the offlcera and crew or the vessel, but
Detchmendy couldn't keep his hand* off.
When he came aboard the morning of
the day on which the transport sailed
he went to the captain's cabin, and lind-
Insj it comfortable, he chose it for his
own. Captain Butler is something of a
naturalist and he had among other things
in his cabin some tropical plants, a col
lection of live birds and a few curious
lizards. These Captain Detchmendy bad
thrown out upon the deck, and then he
Installed himself. When Captain Butlei
heard of It he was sufficiently angry to
beard the commanding quartermaster In
the cabin and have It out with him, but
Detchmendy would not give up the cabin.
He told Captain Butler that ho alone was
in command, and to prove it be sum
moned the chief engineer and told him to
light his Ores and nave steam up within
an hour and a halt. as they might be
getting under way in that time, He did
not know that no chief engineer who un
derstands his business will get up steam
OH a big vessel In any such time as that,
nor was he aware of the fact that steam
was already up and had been all day.
Butler made himself a bunk up In the
chartr n and the vessel went to sea
with the quartermaster still running
things. It might be Interesting to know
how be will run matters if the snip strikes
a typhoon.
The question Â«of authority over the
transport is one that baa come up more
often than any one supposes In the ser
vice just started by tin.- Government.
Captain Butler la master of a British ship
under charter, or perhaps he would never
have allowed himself to be so Imposed
upon. Had he followed the example of
some American captains who have run
up against commanding quartermasters,
it would have been hard lor Detchmendy;
but Butler probably did not wish to have
any trouble while the vessel was under
charter. He did refuse, however, to al
low his crew to clean up the quarters oc
cupied by the soldiers. It is Colonel
Long - orders that the soldiers keep their
berth decks clean.- Captain Detchmendy
reversed this and wanted the ship crew
to do It. But the ship's crew will not
There have been various vague stories
regarding this same question ol authority.
One was that of a colonel who believed
he would take possession of the captain S
cabin becaive he thought it more com
fortable than the one assigned him. He
learned a lesson in transport authority
and remained in his own quarters. An
other wanted to reach Manila by what
his ruler and an old chart told him was
the shortest distance. He thought the
vessel was not headed properly by the
compass, but he. too, learned a lesson. It
was a case of "who runs the ship that
brought the Bcandla to a standstill In
mldocean until some army subaltern
learned that the had not the authority of
a major general, even If he were at sea,
and a number of other things of a similar
nature have cropped up now and then to
teach landsmen what to do aboard a ship.
But Captain Butler la new to the Ameri
can transport service. If he makes an
other trip he will probably act differently
and keep his own cabin for himself.
The four men from the Forty-eighth
Regiment that have been taken down
with smallpox have been sent out to tho
recently vacated camp near the fort. The
men are Corporal Charlie Arter. Com
pany F, Clint Owens of Company r,
Lee Matthews of Company M nnd I-on-
Die Bryant Of Company C. In addition
to these four. James Fleming and Wade
Porter of Company B are under detention
In the hospital in an Isolated ward to
await developments.
Some one had to go out with the cases
to the detention camp, and as soon as it
was known there was to be another siege
of it out there. Dr. 11. A. Glanninl, an
acting assistant surgeon on duty at the
hospital nd a young physician well
known In this city, volunteered for the
duty and was accepted. With him the
following hospital corps men offered
themselves: William C. Dickey and
Samuel J. Perry, nurses. Max List, cook;
John K. Rlnken, orderly, and John F.
Dlllard, ambulance driver. They took
their patients In the ambulance Sunday
afternoon and wont out to their long
vigil. it will be several weeks before they
see their friends again. The cases are
not serious ones, but they are none the
loss contagious. It is hoped, however,
that all have developed. The Forty
eighth was recruited at Fort Thomas,
where the Thirty-first was recruited. The
Thirty-first brought the disease with it.
and the Forty-eighth has done the same.
it is believed they need â  bonfire at Fort
Thomas.
The Forty-fourth Infantry will leave for
the islands to-day, and as a finale to Pre
sidio life. Colonel McClernand ordered a
dress parade and review In heavy march
ing order yesterday afternoon. To those
who had never s.en a soldier in heavy
marching order the ceremony was par
ticularly Interesting. Every man had, be
sides his arms and cartridge bolt, hi*
haversack, canteen, tin cup. knapsack
and blanket roll and rubber poncho
tucked under his belt. They were well
laden, but they bore their burdens
sturdily. The regiment made a fine ap
pearance and looked ready for business.
With the assistance of rain and six
Inches of mud, Captain McAlexander,
quartermaster and commissary of the
general hospital, has succeeded in secur
ing an appropriation of $15<V> for outside
repairs to the hospital, which moans a
board walk to keep people from sinking
out of sight. Through all the last storms
people picked their way through a soft.
clinging, rubber-like paste, hunting for
dry spots and finding puddles. 1 A good
part of the old parade ground had been
tracked Into the hospital buildings before
Captain McAlexander secured his ap
