VOLUME LXXXVIâ NO. 141.
MANY VESSELS WERE
LURED TO DESTRUCTION
Whifehead, Nova Scotia, the Scene of
Daring Acts of Piracy and Bucca
neering by the Munro Family,
WHITEHEAD, N. S., Oct. 18.â There has been brought to
light here one of the most appalling stories of modern buc
caneering and piracy, the luring of vessels to destruction by
exhibition of false lights, the burning of buildings, the scut
tling of vessels and similar crimes. A veritable reign of terror
has existed for years, but the people have never dared to make
the matter public until now. The Munro family has increased
and multiplied and the gravest charges are made against its
members. The agent of the Portland Packing Company who
boarded with the Munros was robbed of $1400. One of them
was arrested, but owing to the fear of the witnesses to testify
was acquitted. He sued for false arrest and recovered dam
ages.
Captain Abner Munro, owner of the schooner Juventa, put
up a scheme to defraud the insurance companies and scuttled
the craft, collecting SSOOO. He was sentenced to six years'
imprisonment, and now has just been discovered the awful story
of this great series of crimes, too long to be narrated here. Mrs.
Melinda Munro. angered by her brother, Enos, Collector of the
Port, who seized her son's schooner for smuggling, informed the
Government of the scheme of the Munros to burn the Whitehead
lighthouse and murder the keeper so as to erect a false light on
another shore and lure ships to their ruin. This scheme was
partly executed. Mrs. Munro then revealed a iong list of burn
ings and scuttlings and lurings ashore by false lights. Among
these was the schooner Mary J. Wells, which they looted and
burned.
Cables of vessels at anchor were cut, and the vessels
drifted upon the rocks and were looted. Once in a great while
the rumor would get out that a fishing vessel had been lured
ashore by a false light and destroyed. It was alleged that the
schooner Spencer of the Naird line of Gloucester, which was lost
with ail hands off the Nova Scotia coast, near this place, was
the victim of wreckers and false lights. In fact, Whitehead has
been the most dreaded part of the Nova Scotia coast except
it be Sable Island. Near Whitehead scores of Gloucester fisher
men have met their doom during the past few years, but how
many of these losses have been due to the luring of these ves
sels ashore by false lights will never be known.
MATTERS TO BE COVERED

that a treaty providing for a new plan of
government will probably be submitted to
the Senate during the coming session.
Announcement is to be made of the
modus vivendi agreed to for a temporary
boundary between Alaska and British
possessions and the hope to be expressed
that a permanent agreement will be
speedily reported, and that, through the
medium of the high joint commission, all
other questions pending between the â 
United States and Canada will be dis- j
posed of at an early date.
Department of Commerceâ The neces
sity for a new executive department, with
a Cabinet officer at its head, to have
charge of all matters relating to inter
state, colonial and foreign commerce,
which are now scattered among the sev
eral different departments, to be strongly
urged.
Financialâ The maintenance of the pres
ent gold standard, the currency and bank
ing recommendation to be based upon the :
conclusions of the Republican caucus
committee of the House of Representa
tives and the Republican members of the
Finance Committee of the Senate. Atten
tion will be directed to the satisfactory
working of the tariff and Internal revenue
laws and to the fact that the receipts of
the Government are equal to the expendi
tures, notwithstanding the heavy drain of
the Philippines campaign.
Trusts- Regulation of trusts and great
commercial combinations so as to pre
vent the stifling of competition and the
levying of tribute upon consumers by in
ordinate advances in prices, but without
in any way hampering the development of
American manufacturing and commerce.
[nterocean Emphasis to be given
to formal recommendations and to the
importance of early action by Congress
for the construction of an interoceanic
waterway to meet the new military and
commercial situation growing out of the
acquisition of islands in the Caribbean
Sea and in the Pacific Ocean. Recom
mendation as to specific route to be de
layed until the Canal Commission makes
its report.
Shippingâ The passage of a subsidy bill
to be urged lor the establishment of
American steamship lines to the colonies
and to enable American ships to compete
for the commerce of the world.
Armyâ Recommendations for the perma
nent reorganization of the army to be de
layed until after the close of the war in
the Philippines. Regulars and volunteers
generally to bo commended for heroic con
duct; and recommendations to be made
for special medals for all volunteers who
remained In service after the ratification
of the treaty of peace with Spain, and for
all regulars who especially distinguished
themselves under fire.
Navyâ Several additional cruisers of the
Olympia class, authority for the purchase
of Krupp armor and an increase of of
ficers and men to be recommended. No
reference will probably be made to the
nominations of Rear Admirals Sampson
and Schley and other officers participating I
in the Santiago campaign, which failed of j
action last session of Congress, but later
In the session something will probably be
done by the administration toward re
warding these men.
Memorial bridgeâ Recommendations to
be made for the construction of a memo
rial bridge connecting Washington with
the Arlington National Cemetery to com
memorate the memory of the men who
fell in the civil and Spanish wars, and to
symbolize the reunion of the North and
the South.
SAN FRANCISCO, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 19, 1899.
BOERS CLOSING IN ON THE
BRITISH FORCES AT LADYSMITH
Preliminary Encounters Precede the First
Important Battle of the War, Which
Is Now in Progress,
LONDON, Eng., Oct. 19.
â What will probably
prove the first impor
tant action of the war is reported
to have commenced Wednesday
twenty miles west of Ladysmith,
Natal, the cavalry scouts. Gen-|
era! Sir (ieorge Stewart White.
having encountered the Orange
Free State commands, reported j
to number more than io.oooj
men. and which invaded Xatal
through the passes of the Dra
kensberg Mountains. It is un
derstood that General Prinsloo,
commandant general of the Free
State, is directing the movements
of the Boers.
General White has 9000 men
of all arms and is sending r.
strong force to support the out
posts, and a few hours are likely
to give indication of the result
of the first test of strength be
tween the Boers and the British.
A few fresh rumors from the
Mafeking district do not carry
knowledge of the real situation,
but as nearly all reports are from
Boer sources and do not claim
substantial victory, it may be as
sumed that Colonel Baden-
Powell's command there is hold
ing its own. The situation of the
British, however, is undeniably
unpleasant. Unless reinforced
they will be compelled to suc
cumb, as the enemy has all the
advantages, including Mafeking' s
water supply, which has already
been cut off.
LADYSMITH, Oct. IS, 5:25 p. m.â The
British forces came into contact with the
enemy In the neighborhood of Acton
Homes and Lesters station, about sixteen
miles out. this morning.
The British cavalry patrols have been
in action at Acton Homes and Leaters
station since midday, and the action Is
still In progress. A number of casual
ties has been reported. Supports are
leaving the camp and expect to fight to
morrow.
Boer-British Movements on the Natal Frontier.

communication.
The Boers are â working . around both
sides with the idea of getting south of
Ladysmith and attacking In force with
the co-operation of Commandant General
Joubert.
Reports have been received here stating
that the Boers moved from Helpmakaar
to-night to cut the railway between Glen
coe and Ladysmith, near Waschbank, and
also that they have threatened Colenso
by means of bands sent from the Free
State, General Meyers commanding, sent
from Helpmakaar. The Free Staters are
advancing in two columns from Tlntwa
and Van Reenans passes against this
place. .â _â .â¢:".â¢*.â ".*
General Jouborfs forces are moving
against Glencoe and testers station, on
the llarrismith branch line.
The Boers from Van Reenans Pass came
by the Blaanwbank way, their patrols fir
ing early this morning on the British
scouts. Three hundred Boers tried inef
fectually to cut off small parties of the
British, but the Natal boys were more
wary than they and retired firing. The
Boers, as usual, took advantage of the
hills, rocks and gullies to hide themselves,
but being unable to advance they used
cannon against the British riflemen, who
nevertheless maintained a stout resist
ance. The tiring was very heavy.
The country about Acton Homes being
more open, the English mounted volun
teers there are falling back upon Dew
drop. The force of Boers engaged at Ac
ton Homes numbered about 2000. There
were rather fewer at Besters. It is re
ported that the Boers there are hemmed
in and suffering severely.
An official note published here says: "A
Free State commando yesterday' com
menced actual hostilities. The Free State
has thus taken on itself the responsibility
of beginning war and cannot hereafter
pose as the injured party."
BRITISH WORRIED OVER
SITUATION AT MAFEKING
LONDON, Oct. 19.â There is still no
authentic news from Mafeking, but all
reports tend to confirm the belief that
Colonel Baden-Powell is holding his own
and no credit is given to the vague rumor
that a flag of truce had been displayed.
A considerable enpragement. is antici
pated in the vicinity of Ladysmith to-day.
The combined advance of Boers and Free
State troops in this direction lias been ex
ecuted with no inconsiderable skill, and
shows a clear appreciation of the British
position. General Sir George Stewart
White has 12.000 men and forty-six guns
available, besides a considerable force of
volunteers, to hold Lady smith, and no
anxiety is felt on his account, for tho
Natal country, where the engagement is
expected, is fairly open, and although the
work of moving them will be difficult, the
guns, arc likely to do good work.
The country is not favorable for Boer
tactics, and It will be very difficult for
them to avoid the exposure of their flanks
to attack by a vigorous and mobile enemy
already occupying useful positions, that
is. supposing they really mean to fight
and nut merely to attempt to draw Gen
eral White farther out with a view of sur
rounding him. General White has a large
body of excellent cavalry, which will be
put to good use.
The foregoing about exhausts the actual
war news this morning. The worst fea
tures of the situation are regarded to be
the probability of native risings, which,
whether on behalf of or against the Boers,
are certain to produce serious complica
tions, besides danger to the few hundred
whites in these districts.
The havoc the Boers are making with
the railway and telegraph lines will seri
ously impede the movements of General
Sir Redvers Buller's army corps. There
are conflicting reports as to whether the
Boers have or have not occupied Helpma
koar. According to the best accounts the
rumor that they have clone so is untrue,
but if the Boers have succeeded in this
maneuver they are completely around the
right of General Stewart White's position
and will be able both to attack him at an
advantage or move down Into Natal be
hind him.
The Daily News points this out and
seems to think that if the Boers loop their
way through Zulu territory or Basuto
land the natives ought to be permitted to
exact respect for their own territory.

SHAMROCK MUST NOW
GIVE TIME ALLOWANCE
Challenger and Gup Defender Columbia
Both in Fine Form for the Third
Race of the Series.
NEW YORK, Oct. 18.â Measurer John Hyslop announced at the New York
Yacht Club that the new measurement of the Shamrock made by him this
morning: shows the yacht's present water line to be 55.95 feet, and her racing
length, by club rule. 102.565 feet. He states that the Shamrock will now allow
the Columbia sixteen seconds In a thirty-mile course. To-morrow's race will
be fifteen miles to windward or leeward and back, the start to be made at 11
o'clock, as usual.
NEW YORK. Oct. I?.â A half hour be
fore sunset to-day the Shamrock lay in
side Sandy Hook, gently tugging at her
mooring buoy. An eighth of a mile away
was the Columbia idly rocking on the
ripple within the Horseshoe. On board
th>-> Shamrock there was activity. Her
crew wns completing the 'adjustment of
shrouds and stays to secure the new top
mast that had been sent up at noon to
replace the one carried away yesterday.
On board the Columbia there was no ac
tivity. All were at ease. The crew sat
on deck, where everything was ready for
to-morrow's event. Captain Barr leaned
against the slide of the companionway
and smoked. Meanwhile he gazed across
the water, watching the progress of prep
aration on the disabled opponent. Condi
tions aboard the American craft indicated
calm anticipation and serene confidence.
The stress of preparation about the Brit
ish yacht well marked the natural anx
iety there as to the performance of the
untried spar and the entire craft in to
morrow's weather.
Early in the day it had been the pur
pose of the visitors to go outside with
the Shamrock and test her new equip-
merit, but though she came down the
harbor from her remeasurement early
this afternoon the shortening daylight af
forded too little time after all had been
snugged.
Meanwhile in the upper bay, off Bay
ridge, the steam yacht Erin, with Sir
Thomas Llpton on board, had been coal
ing ship. He had hoped repairs might
be finished in time to permit the Sham
rook to try out somewhat In a spin out
side.
At 4:30 o'clock the Erin steamed down
to her moorings within the Hook. Stand
ing on the bridge Sir Thomas observed
the last detail of her preparations and
his hope for a spin out to-day gave way
to conviction to its Impossibility. As the
Erin's crew ceased turning and she
slowed down near her moorings, Sir
Thomas was peering through his glasses
toward the Narrows, where he sighted the
hig liner Oceanic bearing down, outward
bound.
"I shall go outside with the Oceanic,"
said he. "to bid gdod-by to Lord Beres
ford and other friends on board."
A little later, while Sir Thomas chatted
and leaned on the quarter dock bulwarks,
a little sloop sailed by within hailing dis
tance. Three men thereon, each holding
aloft a mug of beer, shouted heartily,
"Here's luck to you for to-morrow, Sir
Thomas!" A half-amused smile over
spread the face of the Shamrock's owner
as he heard, and lifted his cap.
"Do you know," he ejaculated, "there
have come to me many evidences of good
will? Here, for instance," added Sir
Thomas, selecting one from many tele
grams that had just been sent from shore,
"here is some friend who says: 'Don't
be disheartened. Shamrock may lose, but
Sir Thomas wins the respect and good will
of millions of Americans.' And I can say
now through the Associated Press to mi
own people and to the American people
that I have proved what I believed to be
true â that no man ever met a more cor
dial greeting than 1 have here. No man
ever found more generous hearts, more
willing hands or more honest men than I
have since I came to America. I have
proved this, I say, to the people of my
own nation." And the manner of Sir
Thomas was emphatic.
"And if the Shamrock should lose now.
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
how long- before her owner may appear
here with another boat to lay siege to the
trophy?" was asked.
"Ah, that brings me back." said Sir
Thomas, -'to the greatest difficulty I have
confronted here. I must be sure of a de
signer. I cannot design a boat and I
must be certain on that point before I
can talk of another attempt should the
Shamrock lose now. You see, I am seri
ously embarrassed because of Mr. Fife's
illness. I have not seen my designer in
over three weeks. We take in over three
tons of ballast -to-day, do you see? Well,
then we suffer because Mr. Fife Is unable
to be about and direct these matters that
none of the others of our party are skilled
In. Is she on her true water lineâ the line
she was designed to sail on? We are not
sure. Her designer would know, but he
has not seen his boat since she was first
measured. He is sick and unable to leave
his room. We do not know whether the
Shamrock has ever in these waters sailed
on her true water line. She is certainly
not now sailing on the same water lino
as when she sailed In the Solent. The
ballast put in the Shamrock to-day was
put. in on Mr. Fife's advice. Has it been
so placed as to serve the exact purpose
he intended? We do not know to a cer
tainty. He is sick and we have done the
best we know how. It is a most serious
handicap for us to be deprived of his per
sonal direction and advice."
The ballast put aboard the Shamrock
last night consists of pigs of lead weigh
ing about twenty-five pounds each, made
handy in shape to stow in between the
frames of the yacht, down as low as pos
sible, where they will do the most good.
Three and a half tons of it was passed
on board and stowed below. Most of this
weight was put aft. judging from the ap
pearance of the yacht to-day, for she
seemed to trim more by the stern than
before.
It was learned to-day that the cause
of the accident to the topmast was not
the parting of the shroud at the "nip,"
as was generally supposed. The mast it
self broke first, not being able to stand
the strain brought upon it by the
wrenching swing of the great club top
sail spars when the yacht plunged into
the head seas. One of the 3hrouds broke,
it is said, when the wreckage went down
to leeward.
The Shamrock picked up her old gre^n
mooring buoy on the Horseshoe at
this forenoon. Half an hour after mak
ing the anchorage the new topmast,
phrouds and stays â .â¢ up. When
the Erin arrived at 4:30 from Bayridga,
where she. had been coaling, the Sham
rock's crew wore clearing up the deck.
All in all it had been a hard (lay's prep
aration. Mr. Ratsey kept ship on ihe
Plymouth in the absence of the others
on deck. Captains Hogarth and Wringe
were turned in below getting a wink of
sleep, and so it fell to him to meet all
callers.
"My men worked last night." said Mr.
Ratsey, "repairing the tear in the top
sail. It was well there was no race to
day, for there would not have been wind
enough."
The Columbia's men had a day of rest.
The entire scene of action had been
changed by the unfortunate break. It
was the laddies on the Shamrock who
looked out from their ease on earlier
days and watched the Columbia men
working aloft and below and overhauling
the standing and running rigging. True
the Columbia men made the usual exami
nation of the ship this morning and later
scrubbed the yacht's side-. After that
they rested. C. Oliver Iselin left for
home early in the morning, and it was
late in the afternoon before he returned.
A number <>f Sir Thomas I,ipton's
guests snilcil to-day for Europe on the
White Star steamship Oceanic. Lord and
Lady Charles Beresford were the last to
go aboard the oceanic. The other guests
of Sir Thomas who sailed on the Oceanic
were Hon. Cecil Brownlow, Halnford
Burdette, Right Hon. Arnold Morley.
M. P., F. Morley, and Mr. and Mrs.
Alfred Muir, Kenneth Murchlson, L.

UNREST AMONG THE
WARLIKE TRIBESMEN
Lerothodi, Paramount Chief of the Basutos.
A Transvaal emissary recently visited Lerothodi to ask what he Intended

the sons fight, too."
LONDON. Oct. IS.â A new and serious element In the military situation Is the
rising of the warlike tribe of Basutos, under Chief Mehoko, against the
Orange Free State. The British must keep the Basutos quiet, and the par
amount chief, Lerothodi, has thus far behaved well. Reports are current,
however, that the other chief? may follow the example of Mehoko. More

QUEEN COLLS FOR
THE MILITIA RESERVE
SecoQd Message to Parliaroerjt Causes Debate,
ir> Wtych Harcourt Scores Chamber
lain's Policy.
LONDON, Oct. IS.â ln the House of
Commons to-day the First Lord of
the Treasury and Government lead
er, Arthur J. Balfour, brought In the
following message from the Queen:
"The state of affairs in Africa having
constituted, in the opinion of her Majesty,
a case of emergency within the meaning
of the act of Parliament, her Majesty
deems it proper to provide additional
means for military service. She has,
therefore, thought it right to communi
cate to the House that her Majesty is, by
proclamation, about to order the embodi
ment of the militia and to call out the mi
litia reserve force, or such part thereof as
her Majesty may think necessary for ser
vice."
The House agreed to consider the royal
message to-morrow. A motion by Mr.
Balfour appropriating the entire special
session for Government business was car
ried by 279 votes against 4S.
The debate on the address in reply to
the speech from the throne was then re
sumed. Philip James Stanhope, Liberal
memDer for Burnley, moved an amend
ment strongly disapproving the conduct
of the negotiations with the Transvaal.
He attacked the policy of the Secretary of
State for the Colonies, Joseph Chamber
lain, and demanded that the latter should
clear himself of the charge of complicity
in the Jameson raid. Arter denouncing
the action of Cecil Rhodes and the South
African League, Mr. Stanhope said:
"The British High Commissioner In
South Africa, Sir Alfred Mllnor, Is lack-
Ing In the qualities necessary to ;i diplo
mat In his position. While entirely ac
quitting the Government, as a whole, c.f
any connection with those doubtful trans
actions, and believing that they are ani
mated by peaceful motives, I am con
vinced that the Secretary of State for the
les and the Britisn High Commis
sioner in South Africa have for the last
two years been fully determined that war,
and war only, should end this crisis, and
that they have worked for this consum
mation during the last year."
The amendment was seconded by Sam
uel Thomas Evans, Liberal member for
the middle division of Glamorganshire.
Mr. Chamberlain emphatically dissented.
Sir William Vernon Harcourt, Liberal
member for West Monmouthshire and
former leader of the Liberal party, fol
lowing several minor speeches for and
against the Government, said it was the
duty of the House to support the Govern
ment in maintaining the integrity of the
dominions of the Queen, hut that they
had a right to speak of the policy of the
Government in an altogether different
tone. He went on to justify the opposi
tion's criticism of the conduct of the ne
gotiations prior to the receipt of the ulti
matum, declaring his belief that there
were salient circumstances in the trans
action which do not tend to a peaceable
solution.
"Although I do not charge the Govern
ment," naid Sir William, "with deliber
ately avoiding a peaceful solution, in my
opinion there is no justification for say
ing that there has been criminal obstl
nancy in the Transvaal. It has been
found, on wise advice from the Orange
Free Stat--- and the Government of the
Cape Colony, that the Transvaal, until
the door was shut, yielded and was con
tinuing to yield to our pressure."
He then proceeded to contrast Mr.
Chamberlain's previous utterances with
his present attitude.
Discussing the cause of the final breach
Sir William Bald:
"< >n September 6 the Transvaal sent a
dispatch pressing for the appointment of
a joint commission to consider their offer,
on condition that suzerainty be dropped.
Everybody is now convinced that suzer
ainty was dropped in ISS4. (Loud Mlnis
BOYHOOD FRIENDS
GREET M'KINLEY
The President Visits His
Birthplace.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NILES, Ohio, Oct. IS.â ln this town
President McKlnley first saw the light of
day. Thousands of his boyhood friends
gathered at the railway station this after
noon to cheer him on his journey back to
Washington, after a tour which covered
over S<XK) miles through the West and
Northwest, and during which time the
chief executive of the nation ha? delivered
almost a hundred Bpeechea to thousands
upon thousands of enthusiastic citizens.
Only three of the Cabinet members re
mained In the party which appeared to
bow acknowledgments to the warm recep
tion which awaited them here. The Presi
dent, when the cheering had subsided,
spoke as follows:
â¢'1 fear I will not be able to make my
self heard by this great audience. It is
to me a matter of extreme pleasure to be
able after bo many years of absence to
come back to the old town in which I was
born, and I need not tell you that many
cherished memories crowd my mind as I
stand in this presence. The old frame
school house and the. church have disap
peared nnd in their place- splendid struc
tures have hul ld ed up. This town has
had its upa and downs.
<A voice: "Not since you went in,
though â no down since th<=>n.")
"I am glad to know that it is enjoying
the upward rise at this time and that
prosperity is in your shops and factories
and happiness and contentment i:i your
homes. I know, my fellow citizens, that
you will be certain of the high apprecia
tion I feel to have the school children of
my native town here in such vast num
bers waving the flag we love. We
never loved that flag as we love it to
day. There never were so many people
devoted to it, willing to sacrifice life for it,
as there are in the United States to-day.
And wherever that flag floats, raised by
the soldiers of the United States, It repre
sents Just what It represents here, the
highest privileges, the broadest opportu
nity and the widest liberty to the people
beneath it."

Secretaries of State were of that
opinion."
Mr. Chamberlain emphatically dis
sented.
Sir William, resuming 1 , went on to say
that suzerainty was only formally an
â¢ nounced to President Kruger by Mr.
i Chamberlain in 1899. He commented upon
; the "extraordinary delay in sending the
final proposals of Great" Britain."
: i "The British nation," he exclaimed,
"has a right to know what the proposals
of the Government are. The Government
has no right to involve the nation in a
war in the dark. I cannot conceive why
the good offices of the Orange Free State
â  were rejected, and I think that the nego
tiations might have been conducted dlf-
I ferently with a different issue. I disas
sociate myself altogether from responsi
bility of any kind for the measures which
! have led to this war, though I am pre
j pared to support the Government in the
\ unhappy conflict in which we are en
! gaged." The House then adjourned.
The calling out of the militia and the
military reserves has occasioned wlde-
Bpread wonderment Other stories of
; preparations against Continental combina
: tions are revived. It is freely rumored
j that the Government is determined to
demonstrate to Europe that the British
army is not a negligible quantity.
Roth the attitude <.f Europe and that of
the natives of South Africa have some
: thing to do with this attitude, and the
j lavish display of force is intended, doubt
less, not only to check the ill will appar
ent on both side.-; of the Rhine and be
yond the Vistula, but also to guard
against the "black peril."
According to the statistics published
â¢ this year the militia, including the perma
nent staff and the militia reserve, num
bers 132.493.
It is not believed that the militia are
to be sent to South Africa. Presumably
I they will replenish the denuded British
1 garrison towns and thus permit the Gov
ernment to send to the Cape all the regu
lars rendered necessary by the develop

BOURKE COCKRAN
ON IMPERIALISM
Yet Time for America to
Recede.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, Oct. IS.â The anti-Imperialist
meeting at Central Music Hall came to a }
close to-night, Hon. Bourke Cockran of I
New York delivering the oration of the !
evening. The hall was filled and the re-,
marks of the orator were greeted with ap
proval by those present. Mr. Cockran |
based his objection to the policy of the
Government on the broad ground that one I
people had no right to force a government j
on another. He discussed the question in ;
a dispassionate manner, claiming that
there were many reasons why the United
States should hold the Islands, but no rea
son why it should attempt to force upon
any people a form of government to
which that people objected. The confer
ence adjourned at the conclusion of Mr.
Cockran' s address, those in charge of the
meeting expressing themselves as de-
Lighted with the success of the affair.
In the course of his speech Mr. Cockran
said:
In rivaling with the fruits of the late war
two courses .-:r.> open to vs â one, the old
course of treating our success as an oppor
tunity t'Â» wrest from the conquered foe the
utmost he can be made to yield; the ot*>er. j
to establish a ni w standard of justice in the
deelinge of nations with each other by refus
ing to accept either tribute or territory tor
ourselves and by innkinc; the conditions of !
provision tor Improving the conditions!
of men.
If, on the other hand, we conclude to ac
cept no other reward than the establishment
of free and benelV.-nt governments In the ter
ritories wrested from Spain, we will show that
we did not take up arms for conquest or plun- I
der, but for Justice and humanity.
The President proclaiming such a policy so j
novel and so enlightened would take a place ;
In history as distinct and conspicuous as that !
of Abraham Lincoln while this country would i
acquire a moral influence among nations un- |
pieceder.ted and unparalleled.
The example of a great country redeeming at |
the close of a successful war the profession I
with which it was bcimnâ risking the lives and j
treasure of Its citizens for no nther purpose
than for the rescue of a suffering people from \
Intolerable oppressionâ would produce puch an
effect on the world that it would be difficult ;
for any other country to make war for a \
baser purpose.
It would be an Inspiring answer to the uni
versal aspirations for peace which brought Into
existence the recent conference at The Hapne.
Our Eastern complications prevented us ren
dering a priceless service to humanity and
gaining immeasurable glory for ourselves at i
The Hague, but that opportunity is by no
n-..*nns lost. The policy of civilization ami hu- ,
mauity may utill he adopted by the American
people, even if the President falls to Initiate It
aye, even if lie should oppose it. indeed, the
glory of establishing ourselves in the primacy
of civilization will be increased, n<.t lessened, !
if It Vie achieved by the people themselves in
spite of the officers who control our Govern
ment. â¢
I do not Buy this through a desire to make
any issue with the executive. I repeat that
the purpose of this conference Is to promote
unanimity, not to aggravate division. What
ever we may think .of the President's action,
it 18 only fair to admit that the policy to which
he appears Inclined and which we condemn
casts the only shadow of doubt on his own poli
tical prospects. If the issues of the next elec
tion were confined to the preservation of exist
ing economic conditions I don't think any
American doubts his campaign would have been
a triumphal march to success. Whatever
doubt now clouds the result he has himself
created, and however this may affect our opin
ion of his prudence. It should be accepted as
a proof of good faith.

MARCONI SYSTEM
FOR WEST INDIES
Wireless Communication Between
the Islands and the Alain-
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLINGTON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, Oct.
18. -Satisfied of the value of wireless telegraphy as the result ot je\era
days' experience, the War Department contemplates adopting the Marconi
system without further experiments. Should the Government be successtui
in the negotiations for the Marconi system, it is proposed to erect stat ' ons
at Key West and Havana. One important effect of the erection of tnese
stations will be to relieve the Government from dependence upon the western
Union monopoly controlling the single cable connecting these points.
Aside from this aspect of the matter, however, it is proposed to connect all
the American West Indies by means of the Marconi system. If the negotia
tions are successful, stations will be erected on the east end of Cuba and on the
Western coast of Hayti. No doubt is felt of the ability of electric waves to
traverse the fifty-five miles separating these points.
The land lines of Hayti and Santo Domingo will convey a message sent to
San Juan to the easternmost point of Santo Domingo, where a wireless telegraph
station will be established, and the electric waves will be sent across the eighty
miles of water to a station to be located on the western shore of Porto Rico.
The establishment of a station at Key West may be postponed because of the
yellow fever scare prevailing there.
Stations may be established also in Hawaii to connect the islands of that
group.
A department official said to-day that final arrangements for the establish
ment of wireless telegraphy had not been perfected with Marconi, who is to come
to Washington upon the conclusion of the yacht races to confer with Lieu
tenant Colonel Squier of the Signal Corps, who, under Greely, has charge of the
matter.
The department Is satisfied with Mr. Marconi's assertion that he can send a
message a hundred miles as well as he can send it fifty, and has accepted his
statement that he can send messages across country, although not so well as
across water. It is not improbable, therefore, that stations may be established
in the Philippines.
ROUTE OF THE
NEW RAILROAD
Surveyors Will Begin
Work at Once.
Special DlÂ«patch to The Call.
STOCKTON, Oct. IS.-Engineer Comp
ton and a force of surveyors will to-mor
row begin to survey for a new railroad
from this city to Sacramento.
Surveying will be commenced at the
north side of Stockton Channel. A por
tion of the proposed new road is already
surveyed, for it is the intention to use a
part of the roadbed oi the Woman's Road
for entrance to the water front. Instead
of starting the survey at Sacramento it
was thought best to commence here. The
line will be run from the bed of the Wo
man's Road almost directly north to New
hope. The line will run east of the Sac
ramento road of the Southern Pacific.
It is intended to have branches extend
ing from Newhope and Georgetown to the
Sacramento River.
John Cross, the president of the com
pany, which is incorporated under the
name of the Sacramento and San Joaquin

"1 have never been employed by a rail
road company and have never acted as an
agent or representative of any one in rail
road enterprises." said Mr. Cross to-day,
"but have always used my money and
that of my associates."
"Is Stockton to be the southern ter
minus of the proposed road?" was asked.
"At present, yes; that is the intenti a."

PROF. ARTHUR T. HADLEY.
I and recent graduates united to-night in a
! parade in honor of President Hadley. The
j hit of the procession was the train of the
j "Hadley Transportation Company." It j
j consisted of a locomotive and three cars,
| each of the latter sixteen feet long and )
seven feet high, lighted from within with j
lanterns. The locomotive moved on !
wheels and was fitted with a boiler which |
emitted steam at every stop and continu
j ously rang a bell as a warning of its ap
| proach.
The baggage car contained an excellent
likeness of Chauncey Depew in the act of
throwing out a trunk marked "A. T. H..
lale."
The baggage car and each of the two
! passenger coaches were carried by two
iof the college "sweeps." The whole train
formed a tableau ninety feet long. The
locomotive burned cotton waste and was
equipped with a headlight. The windows
of the passenger coaches contained excel
lent portraits of prominent professors
and graduates. With the cars were twenty
seniors carrying regulation lanterns and
dressed in the garb of brakemen.
Every one in the procession carried a
flaming torch. Each man was also garbed
in academic gown and mortar board of
regulation cut. with the distinguishing
hues. The seniors wore light green, the
juniors blue, the sophomores red and the
freshmen deep green.
From the City Hall the procession
marched to the home of former Professor
George Brush, until last year director of
the scientific department of the univer
sity. President Hadley's home near by
i was the next objective point, and here a
| longer stop was made. President Had
ley'a appearance on the veranda was the
signal for a mighty acclaim. President
! Hartley made one of his characteristic
speeches. The good feeling existing at
Yale toward Harvard was shown when
President Eliot of Harvard was recog
nized near Pre?ident Hartley. The Yale
men cheered him vociferously also.
The celebration terminated with a huge
bonfire near the campus on the old gym
nasium hill.

Thousands Swarm Into Me
chanics' Pavilion to Participate
in the Opening Exercises of the
Three Days of Festivity.
g-, -13 HOUS ANDS of enthusiastic Odd
Fellow? swarmed Into Mechanics'
Pavilion last night to participate
l> In the opening exercises of the
grand celebration of the g
â¢he order in California. Their
the Rebekah lodges were there
their full share In making
â¢ > be remem bored ad
new epoch In Odd Fellowship
In th:> State and on the Pacific I
The members of the Grand Encampment
and of the Grand Lodge had completed
work and those bodies had ad
journed, so that all were free to celebrate
to their hearts content.
The interior of the great building was
decorated from floor to ceiling with the
colors of the subordinate and grand
lodges and of the encampment, tastefully
arranged along the rafters and gallery
railings and entwined around the sup
porting pillars. Each branch of the or
der had its distinctive badge and color.
The subordinate lodges were represented
by streamers and banners of red and
â¢white, the Grand Encampment and Pa
triarchs Militant by purple and the Re
bekahs by Nile green and pink. The
American flag and Orange streamers
were conspicuous everywhere and told of
the jubilee of Odd Fellowship that was
being celebrated. Banners represented
the different districts. Long streamers
festooned from the center of the roof to
the balconies made a very pretty effect,
which was enhanced by dozens of imita
tion palm trees arranged along the gal
lery railing.
The stage, on which were seated the
executive committee, band and the choir.
had been erected at the east end of the
Pavilion, and the chairs for the guests
filled the entire floor, with the exception
of the space allotted to the booths and to
the promenaders. The only unfortunate
feature of the arrangement was the utter
inability ot those occupying seats at a
distance from the stage to hear a word
of the speeches or the songs. But they
could tell when those in front of them
applauded; and in order to be in the swim
they joined in.
The programme was elaborate and well
arranged. It consisted of speeches and
music, both vocal and instrumental. The
speakers, with the exception of Mayor
I'helan, who made a brief address-wel
coming the Odd Fellows to San Francisco,
were aJI members of the order, and as
was to be expected in view of the occa
sion their remarks were confined to Odd
Fellowship, Its past, present and future
in the United States and in California in
particular.
The musical part of the exercises was
an especially pleasing feature, and the
choir and soloists were repeatedly en
cored.
Rut while there were several thousand
seated in the audience there were other
ihousands who strolled about the build
ing admiring the booths and visiting. The
celebration will continue to-day and to
morrow, closing with a grand ball in the
Pavilion Friday night, the exercises last
night being but the opening of the fes
tivities.
March to the Stage.
To the music of an "American Fanta
sle" the executive committee marched
from â ' â â  reception rooms at the east end
of tho Pavilion to the stage at the far
west ond. This was the signal for the en
tertainment of the evening to begin.
On tho stage wore the following mem

the music floated through the hall, when
M. T. Hoses, chairman of committees,

Grand President's Address.
| W. A. Bonynge, grand master of Cali
fornia, wan introduced by the chairman
a* tho {real Odd Fellow of the sunny
south. His addresa was upon the theme
1 "Odd Fellowship: Us Alms and Attain
ment*.' Mr, Bonynge traced the history
of Odd Fellowship in the United States
from [the earliest days to the present
times. Ho Moid In part:
"Sisters and Brethren of the Independ
ent Order of Odd Fellows and friendsâ
The origin of Odd Fellowship Is shrouded
In mystery. The first efforts of Odd Fel
lowship were hardly recorded. Some have
gone as far back as Adam In their efforts
to prove Its antiquity; some have gone
back to the Pharoahs. some to Moses and
some to the Roman camps In the time of
'Nero, but not until 1788 did Odd Fellow
ship come out of the clouds of tradition
and Into the light of history. From that
time on we have record* of Its history.
In America we have 9 word showing
that its beginning In thin Country was In
1802 In 1819 we find the organization of
Washington I>odÂ«o In Boston and soon
after Franklin Lodge In i'nlladelpnla.
What Odd Fellowship Teaches.
"Odd Fellowship teaches US fraternity;
; it teaches up to take an Interest in the
affair? of pur fellow men, to relieve the
sick, educate the orphan and care for the
widow, and this It has been doing for
fifty years. In California. It warms his
heart for hie follow men. turns him Into
I the right path when ho has strayed. When

sickness Is upon him It smooths the pil
j low and relieves him in want. The little
' ones, the motherless, are cared for. It
takes til *c upon whom adversity has
come, clothes them and frees them from
suffering:. It la not only the sick, the dis
tressed, the orphan or the widow that re
:e< Ivi s the bi neflta f I >dd Fellowship. The
double blessing of giving and receiving
is exemplified In Odd Fellowship."
The Mayor's Greeting.
Mayor Phelan was then presented and
said:
"It is a great honor for me to extend a ,
greeting to Odd Fellows. San Francisco i
is i'nmpllmentÂ«Hl by your presence. We
aspire to be a metropolis, and whenever
a tr< neral convocation of Californians is
held we feel proud to have this city se
lected as the meeting place.
"This Is a historic year. It Is fifty years
\ after tho discovery of gold which gave
! birth to this State, as well as to the order
!of Odd Follows. Fifty years is a very
I small time when we measure the life of
| nations, hut how much it means for us! It
I is but two generations of men and there
are many here to-night who have seen
this State grow from its earliest start and
i also this ord< r spring from its first be
ginning and swell to its present greatness.
j The men who came in early days estab
; lishod fraternal organizations. They came
I here to fight for a living, but no sooner
; had they settled fn this country than they
turned their minis to the organization of
fraternal orders and It wa.Â« n^t long after

of ( >dd Fellows was represented by a
lodge hf-re."
Mayor Phelan closed with a tribute to
the order in its great work of charity and
love.
Following the Mayor's address Miss
Flynn sang Tolstoi's "Invano." Her
Ptronp, rich soprano voice carried far
down the Pavilion and won an t-nthuslas
tic applause, which resulted in an
encore.
An Original Poem.
Robert H. Taylor, first noble grand of
California Lodge No. 1, read an original
poem. Its theme was the early struggles
of the settlers, their sufferings arid their
iimbitions and the first plantings of < >'ld
!"â¢ llowship in California. The author was
was i ne of the very lirst members of the
order in California and has been actively
ld( ntified with its progress. The closing
stanza of the poem Is as follows:
Forever may the noble Order live,
KÂ»-.;lns in a^e the vi(?or of its youth.
While c .m!r.K cycles shall new luster give
The golden links of "Friendship, Love and
Truth!"
Odd Fellowship in California.
"OM FVllowship in ralifornia. Its Prog
ress and Development" was the subject of
Morris M. Estee's address. He said in
part:
"Odd FellowÃhlp is a progressive insti
tution, gruwin? with the State. When it
crossed the continent fifty years ago it
moved as a part of our civilization and a
part of our government. It teaches us to
do unto others as we would have them do
unto us. It teaches the people expansion
of the mind and the soul. That is the in
itiation of Odd Fellowship."
Mr. Estee concluded here amid the ap
plause of all. Another song by Miss
Flynn and the concluding address of the
evening followed-
Karl C. IJrueck. P. G. M. and G. R..
spoke of "California Odd Fellowship Now
and Henceforth." He said:
â¢I inward has been the battle cry of the
order and in the lists of battle fields, in
th'- friendly conquests of the order, none
Is fairer than the name of California. This
has become the land Â«r our heritage.
While Odd Fellowship always Invites pe
rusal of its history, what should enlist
your attention is what It will do to-mor
row. It is a great Institution. a live reality.
"The members of the Independent Or
der of Odd Fellows never felt toward one
another but as brothers. Brothers were
we in the days of '61. when the Civil Wari
hurled the nation in civil strife, and!
brothers are we now and brothers will we!
always be. The Odd Fellows' symbol of|
three links, "Love, Friendship ar.dl
Truth," tell what Odd Fellowship is. No|
matter what the differences of opinion!
men have when they come within tht: or J
der they lay aside their differences and
become harmonious members of the grand
order.
"Wo are standing on the threshold of
the future. To tell what our future will
be Is to predicate upon the successes of
the past. The opposition which retarded
our progress formerly is waning and will
pass altogether. The church is beginning
to see that we are not so bad and the
eyes of the laboring masses will see that
we are working for the good of all. The
future will demand a higher standard of
manhood. In order to attain Its highest
state it must demand a purity in busi
ness life, public life, political life and
home life."
The concluding number on the pro
gramme was a part song, "Forty-nine,"
the words by Joaquin Miller, the music
by Leila France, rendered by the choir.
Band Concert.

midnight there was a grand instrumental
concert, during which the Golden Gate
Park Band rendered*

FORESTERS FAVOR
RETRENCHMENT
Session of High Court
at Fresno.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO, Oct. 18.â The annual session
of thf- lli^h Court, of Independent Forest
ers, which opened in this city yesterday,
reconvened at l n o'clock this morning.
The chief topic considered during the day
was the report of the finance committee.
When the report of the high secretary
was taken up for discussion this morning
it was evident that there would be a dis
agreement. In it were embraced ques
tions which had divided the court into two
evenly matched factions. The one was
composed of the rural delegates, who
stood for economy and retrenchment, and
the other of the city delegates, for the
most part professional men. who were in
favor of liberal salaries. Both sides were
generated by able leaders, ex-Clerk Duck
worth of the Assembly and Representa
tive Peery of San Francisco championing
the cause of the city delegates and As
semblymen Fairweather and Michael
Deckman being among the speakers for
the rural opposition.
It was understood from the commence
ment of the session that the fight would
be precipitated by the report of the fin
ance committee appointed by the chief
ranger and controlled by the urban fac
tion. When tl"^ report of the high secre
tary was taken up the report of the com
mittee was called for, but the reading of
it was postponed until the afternoon ses
sion and the rival forces had two hours
: in which to prepare tor the fight.
When the court reconvened at 2 o'clock
the report was read by Chairman C. B.
Dickson. The committee recommended
that the salaries remain the same as tixe.l
by the High court last year, when the
compensation of the high chief ranger
was raised from $1500 to (2000, exclusive of
traveling and other expenses, and that of
the high secretary from $1'") to $125 a
month. This brought on the fight. A mo
tion to adopt the recommendations was
made ami seconded. Michael Deckman
was on his teet in an. instant and was
greeted with applause from the country
delegates when he moved to amend by
making the salary of the chief ranger
Instead of $2000. Deckman's arasnd
ment was the signal for the outbreak of
hosuiities. Chief Ranger McÃTfresh.
whose sympathies were with the city dele
gates, favored free discussion and did not
limit the speakers. The rest of the after
noon was sjient in oratory and at times
the discussions became intensely interest
ing.
It was 5 o'clock before a test vote was
taken on the amendment and when the
ballots were counted it was found that the
amendment had carried by a majority of
four votes. The rural delegates had won
and the court adjourned for the day be
fore the original motion was put.
The compensation of delegates to the
High Court was fixed at 4 cents a mile
and $2 a day, instead of 7 cents a mile as
heretofore.
To-morrow morning the fight will be re
sumed, when the fixing of the high secre
tary's salary comes up. The factions will
also, in all probability, divide when it
comes to the election of officers this morn
ing The probabilities are that McEl
fresn's prestige will overcome the de
feat of his faction on the salary question,
and that he will be re-elected. High
Chief Secretary Perry will also be given
another term, but the offices of high audi
tor and high treasurer will in all likeli
hood be filled by new men.

INSURGENTS PUNISH
TRAITOROUS SPANIARDS
MANILA; Oct. IS.-^-Ten former Spanish
soldiers, who were captured by the Fili
pinos and for a time acted as officers and
member? of a Filipino artillery r>'i>lmer.t
located in the vicinity of Santa Rosa, in
the Laspina de Bay district, determined
to surrender the â¢ tilery to the Ameri
cans. The plot was discovered by the
Filipinos, who killed seven of the con
spirators, the other three escaping to
Manila.
It appears that when the surrender was
agreed on the Spaniards delegated one of
their number to proceed to Manila and to
propose to,General;Otls to surrender after
a prearranged mock battle, about twelve
pieces, including K.rupp and Nordenfeldt
rapid-fire guns well supplied with ammu
nition from the I.lpa powder factory, in
exchange for certain sums to be paid the
Spaniards, who were to be pardoned for
carrying arms apainst the Americans and
to be transported to Spain;
The delc^a'e left Santa Rosa and, ac
companied by three Filipinos, entered the
American lines at Cnla'rabo. The Filipinos
did not proceed far. deciding to await his
return at a given time. As the delegate
was detained in Manila lorsTer than they
had expected, they grew suspicious and
returned to Santa Rosa.
The plot was then revealed and the re
maining 1 Spaniards were attacked. The
punboat Nnnidan, coasting near Santa
Rosa, perceived two men on the beach
hurriedly embarking in a canoe, and,
pushing out toward them, took them on
board. They reported that the Filipinos,
on discovering the plot to surrender the
artillery, had cut the throats of seven of
their Spanish companion? anil that they
themselves had barely escaped with their
lives.
The threp Spnninrds are now hiding in
Manila: fearing Filipino vengeance. Gen
era! Otis had declined their offer through
the delegate to surrender the artillery for
money, but he promises to send the three
to Spain.

partment as follows:
T'Â» chartered transport Tartar Is a British
ship a.nd as j=uch the British law Was deemed
to apiÂ»ljr. r'nder the British law the Tartar
ivas licensed to curry 741 passengers. The
harbor master at Hongkong refused to give
the ship clearance because she carried 1140
troop*. 1 wi?t>d to the department at Wash
ington and the adjutant general at Manila that
clearance was Refused because of overcrowd
ing. Tin- reply Tvas had from Adjutant Gen
â â¢ml CortHn asking if in my opinion the ship
vas overcrowded and If there was cause for
complaint from tt>c- soldiers regarding food. I
replied that the ship was do more crowded
than other transports had been, and that there
was no ground for complaint regarding food.
Before communicaftMon could be had 1 wired
"Cleai allowed.; palled to-day." The
harbor master had. in the meantime, visited
the hip and inspected the light ducts and
ship'Â« boats.
Attention was doubtless called to the ship
and her passenger list by certain of the dis
charged soldiers In person and by an article
which appeared In a Hongkong paper, writ
ten l v a discharged regular soldier, In which
the ship was spok*n ol as a "sardine box."
The actual delay after the ship was ready to
sail, caused by the Incident, was about twen
ty-four hours.
Referring to the report of the command
ing officer of the Twentieth Kansas. Adju- j
tant General Corbln yesterday telegraphed
to General Shatter as folLows:
It Is not quite clear that the Tartar took
on life belts and ship boat* at Hongkong or
that the Inspection of the harbor master sat
isfied him that thÂ» provisions of the Tartar
In that particular were satisfactory*- and as a
result of that Inspection he gave clearance,
etc.
General Shaffer has repMed to this tele
gram by saying that the commanding offi
cer of the Twentieth Kansas reports that
the Tartar took on additional life belts or
boats and that he understood the harbar
master granted the clearance because he
was satisfied with the provisions of the
Tartar in that particular.

SAMPSON SUSTAINED
BY CAPTAIN CHADWICK
Says That He, and Not General
Shafter, Wrote the Famous
Letter to Gen. Toral.
NEW YORK, Oct. 18.â Rear Admiral
Sampson's recent assertion that Captain
Chadwick wrote the letter which Induced
General Toral to surrender Santiago has
awakened much interest In army and
navy circles. Friends of General Shafter
have criticized Rear Admiral Sampson's
assertion as an indirect attempt to rob
the army of rredit, and they have inti
mated that his version of the matter was
incorrect.
Captain Chad-wick when seen to-day on
board the cruiser New York paid: "I
deeply regret that any controversy has
arisen from Rear Admiral Sampson's re
marks, which were made, I have no
doubt, with the sole object of saying
something pleasant about me in a com
munity that had just honored me with a
BwonL No remark can be construed into
;in attempt to detract from credit General
Shafter gained during the Santiago cam
paign, so far as I can ace. I am posi
tive that Rear Admiral Sampson had no
such intention.
"Naturally, I am sorry the letter to
General Toral was ever mentioned, but

Storm Victims in Moun-

Special Dispatch to The Call.
DENVER, Oct. 18.â A special to the Re
publican from Great Falls. Mont., says:
Four men are known to be dead and prob
ably eight more perished in Teton County
from the recent storm. The dead were all
sheep herders. They were: Norman
Druice and one other employed by W. K.
Floweree; Will Graham, working for the
Homer Sheep Company, and a man named
Ladd, employed by Wallace Taylor. Two
herders named Mclntosh and Conley,
working for J. C. Quigley, are probably
dead, as they are missing, though their
Sheep have been found.
Two parties, including women, in the
mountains have not been heard from.
They have tents and food, but may not es
cape. They Include William Cohurn,
Charles McDonnell and their wives, of
I lupuyer, now In the Sun River Canyon,
and W. F. Ralston and four sons, In Birch
Creek Canyon.
The severity of the storm may be judged
by the fact that it took four horses four
days to bring in the body of Will Graham
on a toboggan. The snow is four feet
deep on the "level in parts of Teton County.
A special to the Republican from Tellur-
Ide, < v o!o., says: The body of Thurlow
Washburn, assistant superintendent of the
Liberty Bell Mining Company, who start
ed on "horseback last Thursday for the
properties owned by the company, just
over the range In Ouray County, was
found this afternoon about 150 f<-pt from
the top of the range, near the Virginius

his destination when overcome by the ter

since a question of fact has arisen T feel
obliged to assert thai what Hear Ad
miral Sampson said was wholly true, and
a reputed interview from Genera! Shaf
ter which 1 have noticed shows a lack of
recollection on hie part.
"The letter was draughted on July 6 on
my own motion, after 1 had asked Gen
eral Shatter if he wore open to sugges
tions. He said he would be glad to hear
any suggestions from me, and after read
ing th<-> letter said lie would sign It with
out any change.
"However, before submitting the letter
to General Shatter r showed it to Lieu
tenant Commander Staunton, Assistant
Chief of Staff, who had accompanied me
ashore. He suggested a slight change in
one paragraph, which I adopted. I re
tained the original draft, which was
roughly written in pencil, and my wife
has It as a memento of the campaign.
"Now, I wish it to be distinctly under
stood that I regard all this as trivial,
and my only object in speaking of the
matter is to sustain Rear Admiral Samp
son. What he said concerning the letter
is strictly accurate. Genera] Shatter is I
reported as having snid that the letter
written by me was merely a copy of one
previously drafted by him. I do not un
derstand how this can be correct, as the
letter was sent at my suggestion and I
never before heard of any other draft
than the one I wrote and showed to Lieu
tenant Commander Staunton.
"I can distinctly recall, since the mat
ter has been brought up, the circum
stances which attended the writing of
the letter. I found General Shafter sit
ting in his shirtsleeves and with his feet
in his slippers. He complained of not feel
ing well and seemed much depressed. I
remember that he referred to the largo
numbers of men lost at El Caney and San
Juan Hill, and from the tone of his con
versation I concluded he had no definite
plan of procedure mapped out.
" 'General.' I asked, 'are you open to
suggestions?'
" 'Certainly,' he replied.
" 'Suppose' I said. 'I write a letter to
General Toral, stating the situation
plainly.'
" 'Do so,' he replied, evidently pleased
with the suggestion
"When I drafted the letter, as I have
told. I handed it to General Shafter who
read it carefully and declared himself sat
isfied with it. Tie called to Lieutenant
Colonel Mill y, his chief of staff, and
asked him to have it typewritten. I
pointed out that General Toral might re
gard a typewritten letter as a breach of
courtesy. In this General Shafter ac
quiesced, and he had the letter copied.
"It should be clearly understood, how
ever, that the letter which I wrote and
General Shafter signed, was technically
his letter. He. simply adopted its phrase
ology and sent it as his own. I had no
intention of ever saying anything- what
ever of my connection with the letter and |
the matter had dropped from my mind i
until recalled by Hear Admiral Samp
son.
General Shatter, when told of Captain-
Chadwlck s statement, refused absolutely
to say anything on the subject. Ills man

and declared that he intended to revolt
and to form an independent state. Only
Captain Chanoine decided to accompany
him with some natives. On July 16 the
tirailleurs mutinied and shot Captain
Chanoine.
"Captain Voulet fled, but on July 17
tried to rejoin the expedition, but he was
shot by a sentry. The tirailleurs then
joined the expedition in good order and
the expedition, myself commanding, con-
tinued the mission and punished the mur

HORRIBLE TORTURE
OF A PRISONER
Formosans Live Up to
an Old Custom.
â¦
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C. Oct. 18. -News was
brought by the Empress of Japan of the
performance of a horrible quinquennial
custom of Chaoeheng, a town of about
300 Inhabitants In Southern Formosa, the
headquarters of the Butan tribe and the
key to Hangchanâ a custom whereby an
unfortunate criminal was tortured and
killed. About 90 per cent of the inhabit
ants of Choacheng are aborigines, and
every five years they hold a big fete, at
which a criminal is sacrificed. The vic
tim is taken from his bamboo cage and
an iron rod about six feet in length is
passed through his lower jaw. His hands
are then tied to the ends of the rod and
thus transfixed he Is placed in a decor
ated chariot and paraded through the
streets for two weeks, should he live
thnt long.
The ghastly fete took place this year at
the clo.se of August. The Japanese au
thorities were warned and were on
guard against the exhibition. It was to
have been held on June 12, but they
stopped it. An effort was made two
weeks later to carry it out, but the au
thorities again intervened. The arrange
ments were then thought to have been
dropped, but the natives were secretly
preparing, and when the opportunity
cam.' a robber was found and tortured
In the customary manner.
Transfixed with the rod. he was borne
through the streets of Chaocheng and
then to Hangchung and back to the first
town. He died on the sixth day. Should
the victim survive the torture, as some
have been known to do, he is made a
sort of a demi-god and given high rank.
DIVINE HEALER IS
MOBBED BY STUDENTS
Embryo Medicos Accept His Invita-
tion in a Way He Had Not
Calculated Upon.
CHICAGO, Oct. 18.â Dr. John A. Dowie,
the alleged divine healer and professed
foe of the medical profession, attempted
to lecture to-night in Zion Tabernacle at
Madison and Pauline streets on "Doctors,
Drugs and the Devil." Dr. Dowle had an
nounced that he wished 10,000 medical stu
dents would attend the exercises.
The lecture hall is located close to sev
eral large medical colleges and the stu
dents accepted the invitation with t.ie
gr< atest enthusiasm. Fully 2500 students
gathered at Wood and Harrison streets
and marched to the tabernacle. Every
student was provided with small bottles
of nitride of ammonia and hydro-sulphur
ate of ammonia with which they intended
to bombard Dowle when he began his
address. The police had, however
learned of the plan and thirty officers
were placed in front of the hall to bar
the students out. As t-he carriage con
taining Dr. Dowie approached the alleged
healer was greeted with yells and a
shower of missiles.
In a few instances stones were imed
and ammonia by the pint was thrown
into the carriage. Guarded by the police
and dodging the missiles Dowle was driv
en to the door of the hall, where he was
dragged through the throng by half a
dozen officers. The students were forced
back by the police, but managed to hurl
enough bottles of ammonia Into the hall
to force the waiting audience to rush
out Into the air. To the few who re
mained Dowie made his talk, but it was
a very mild affair compared to the
harangues he frequently bestows upon
the medical profession.
Several students were arrested and
taken to the police station with difficulty,
their companions making determined ef
forts for the rescue.

FARCICAL RACING.
Jockeys Take the Wrong Course In a
Morris Park Event.
N'KVV YORK, Oct. 18.â A good-sized
crowd watched the poorest day's racing
of the season at Morris Park to-day. .The
track was heavy and withdrawals were
: so numerous â : at only two started in the
fifth and three in the sixth race.
The last race developed into a farce.
The conditions called for a milÂ© and three
' quarters over the Withers course. On the
start Spurs, Odom up, and Julius Caesar,
Slack up, went out to make the running,
but Instead of turning across the Withers
I bend went on over the hill course. Wil
i son, on Maid of Harlem, had his wits
i about him, took the right course and
I practically had a walk-over. Odom saw
i his mistake when rounding the upper turn
j and he pulled up and went back, taking
, his horse over the course for second
money. Black, on Julius Caesar, kept on
i and was disqualified, as he had not gone
â  the right course. Both boys were called
| up in the stand for an explanation, but
I nothing was given out by the stewards.
In the first race, a steeplechase at about
! two miles, four of the seven horses which
I ran fell. Burgess, who rode Hardy C, was
1 badly hurt, the doctors diagnosing his
I case as concussion of the brain. Results:

Rusty Gold, recently purchased from D. j
! J. Healey of Petaluma and running in the j
j name of Sterl <fc Knowies, won the mfd
i week reserve stake at Union Coursing ''â 
' Park yesterday. The red dog ran cor.- I
| sistently throughout the day, winning :
I each of his courses cleverly.
In the final he was favored a little by
the fortunes of coursing, or possibly the
flag Indicating: his opponent as victor j
would have been run up. The hare was a
strong one and led the brace of dogs
clean across the field without a swerve.
Rusty Gold led Controller to the hare '
when the latter was placed and scored
two points. In the language of the cours- !
ing field Controller waa "blinked," or lost
sight of the hare momentarily. He ap- !
parently thought the hare had made good i
its escape.

before Controller could get in the running, i

GOSSIP OF
THE HITTERS
AND TWIRLERS
Rating of the League Clubs.
Dudes and Lobsters
Practically Tied.
The interest in the league race has been
switched from the | battle between the
â  adera to the hand-to-hand struggle be
tween Oakland and Santa Cruz. For all
practical accounting both teams are tied,
but 2 per cent separating them in the
ranking column.
The two games which the Dudes took
from the Lobsters last Sunday bridged
the breach, and though the former are
still in the position which seemed theirs
for keeps, they may be third before the
wfok is out. Oakland's record of late is
no less than phenomenal; but very few
games have been lost out of the last
twenty played. This week Oakland meets
harder game, the locals, an.l s.me close
bas. hall should result. The change made
of late in the distribution of positions in
the local team has made it a stronger
nine.
There are two distinct groups in the
four teams playing ball to-day. San
Francisco and Sacramento are in one
group. Oakland and Santa Cruz in the
other. Between the first two teams there
Is a break of 27 per cent, and between the
groups ]i>n p<-r cent. To oust San Fran
cisco from second place will be a difficult
task, and It is not likely to be accom
plished tiiis Beason. San Francisco may
top Sacramento, but every indication
points tv the supremacy of the Senators.
The nest few weeks will decide which
u-am will win the championship.
The ranking of teams is as follows:
If the crowd jeers and hoots at Mr.
Whelan, the sulky pitcher of Santa Cruz,
the I lult lies not with the public hut with
the twirler liims<.-ir". Last Sunday after
noon nls conduct and manner wore suco
as to draw forth hissing disapprobation
from men, women and children. The raan
ner of his going Into the box and the In
solence uf his bearing should be cans.- for
a fixing of a stiff penalty on the part of
tin- manager of the team.
Babbitt distinguished himself in the
ten-inning game Sunday afternoon. X<>t
h nit wns made off his delivery, and this
on top of the morning game. In which he
twirled six innings, shows him to be a
pit ;her of no mean ability.
Drennan is making himself a sensation
In the middle field. There are few hard
drives within the possibility of his reach
thai he does not attack.
The managers of the league are think
ing over the bringing nut of an Eastern
team this year. So far only a geiferal
correspondence has been conducted.
Neither the champions nor the second
team In the National League are anxious
to make the trip; at least their managers
are nm. Another plan that has been con
sldered la to pret together an All-California
tc-iim from the men of this State now
p!.-iyinK in the East and arrange a series
With a picked team of the State League.
"BILLY" KENNEDY WAS
SURPRISED BY FRIENDS
The Ex-Superintendent of the Olym
pic Club Presented With a Gold
Watch and Chain.
â U'illlam J. Kennedy, the popular ex
superintendent of the Olympic Club, re
ceived a pleasant surprise from his
friends yesterday afternoon. It was in
the shape of a handsome sold watch and
chain and testimonial, which were pre
sented to him by his fellow club mat.'s
in appreciation for the many courtesies
extended them during his seven years'
term hi" office in the well-known athletic
institution.
When Mr. Kennedy resigned his position
in the club there were many regrets, as
by bis courteous manner and kindly treat
ment he had won a host of followers. The
hitter,- anxious to show their good feeling
toward him. hit upon the plan of present
ing him with something substantial as a â  !
mark of their esteem. Within a short i
time a large sum was collected without
his knowledge, and this was devoted to â¢
obtaining a beautiful watch, chain and '
locket and to having a testimonial en- I
grossed. Engraved in the inner case of
the handsome timepiece was the inscrip
tion. "To "William J. Kennedy, from his
friends in the Olympic Club." As is his
usual wont. Kennedy went to the chib
yesterday afternoon to play handball. He
did not notice that a larger number of i
men were idling around the gymnasium
than usual, until he was called" from his
exercise by Fred Butz. In a few well
chosen words the well-known sprinter
handed him a plush case containing thÂ°
valuable present and also the framed tes
timonial. "Billy" stammered out some
thing, thanking them for their kindness â 
to him. His eyeglasses grew foggy and ; :
words failed him. His friends, seeing his : :
plight, shook him by the hand and patted !
him heartily on the back.
In the evening Fred Butz, James Me- i !
Kirov. S. F. IfughÂ»s and Frank MeClel- j
land dined the happy man at a downtown i i
rotlsserie and later escorted him to the ' â 
theater. "Billy" Is so proud of the token I
that he is wearing his pocket out admlr
ing the timepiece and showing his friends '
his beautiful present.
Acme Club Sold Out.
OAKLAND. Oct. IS.â Thf> closing scene :
in the life of the Acme Club took place
to-day, v. hen Auctioneer Max Mareuse i
sold the furniture and apparatus. There
, was a large attendance, but it was nt- :
tracted mnro by curiosity than a desire
to purchase. Last night several small
i articles wore taken from the club, but It
is presumed that they wore owned by mi

IT WAS BY MISTAKE
THAT GOAT WAS SENT
HOFFMANN SO EXPLAINS TO
THE HEAXTH BOARD.
The Nymphia Hotel Condemned as
Unsanitary and Unfit for
Habitation.
The Board of Health held its regular
monthly meeting last night. Dr. J. Henry
Bnrbat presiding in the absence of Mayor
Phelan. After some minor reports were
read. Chief Market Inspector N. P. "tt'itze
mann was called on to submit his report.
Wltzemann stated that on Tuesday he
had found some goat meat in the County
Hospital and yesterday had found, while
inspecting meats at the Almshouse, two
legs of goat meat ready to be cooked.
"When asked if he could easily distinguish
dr.ssed mutton from dressed goat meat
he replied: "I could tell the difference in
this case all right; the legs had whiskers
on "em. and billygoat is not mutton."
A Mr. Hutton. representing Hoffman A
Woene, the contracting bu;chers. muos
tioned the inspector and brought out the
fact that the butchers were willing at any
time to rectify any mistakes or make
good any deliciencies. Hoffmann, the se
nior member of the firm, was ask.Â»d to
explain to the hoard why goat meat had
been substituted for mutton. He ex
plained that he did not kill his meats, but
t eived them dressed from the big but

dressed sheep a jruat might pass unde

tected, as It took an expert to distinguish
the difference offhand. If he had deliv
ered goat meat for mutton it was through
mistake and not intentional on his part.
Goat meat was as good as mutton, he de
clared, and not unwholesome. His firm,
he alleged, had given nothing but first
class meat to the institutionsâ as good, in
fact, as supplied to any hotel in San
Francisco. The matter was referred to
the superintendents of the institutions,
with orders to instruct their stewards to
report later to the City and County Hos
pital Committee.
Dr. Lawlor reported that the city
chemist had made thirty-six tests of
shrimps caught in the vicinity of But
chertown and that the tests showed poi
sonous matter in every case. On motion
of Dr. Coffey, the health officer was or
dered to arrest all persons having
shrimps from F.utchertown in their pos
session.
On the report of Dr. L.awlor the board
declared the Nymphia Hotel condemned
as unlit for habitation.
'In.- resignation of Dr. Charles Ellin
wood as visiting physician was accepted
and Dr. Emmet Rixford was appointed to
fill the vacancy. The board presented
resolutions of thanks to Drs. Tillman and
Peters for services rendered at the Twen
ty-sixth str'-rt Hospital.

when the idea of State ownership is fully
taken in, the charge of State socialism or communism

sole right to this flood water, because none other
can in the nature of things own it, has a free field

different. ,

PHELAN ON PATRIOTISM.
IN his speech at the meeting to ratify his nomina
tion Mr. Phelan's narrow-minded partisanship
could not be concealed. With that peculiar intel
lectual obtuseness which is one of his gifts he turned
what began as a compliment intended to coax Repub
lican votes into an insult. Speaking of the Repub
lican ratification meeting he said: "I am sorry for
my Republican friends. * * * Why, the gentle
men who appeared before you are fighting wars in
the Philippines, although Major Geary met but few
of them over there. "
The Mayor evidently proposes to claim not only all
civic virtue but all national patriotism for what he
calls "a new Democracy." Begging for Republican
votes, knowing that they have twice elected him, he
yet feels strong enough to utter the charge that Re
publicans were not patriotic enough to enlist under
their country's flag in the Spanish war. He is not
sure that even some of them went to the Philippines,
for "Major Geary did not find many of them over
there." According to the Mayor the Republicans, for
whose votes he hopes, are without civic pride and are
void of patriotism. The First and Eighth regiments
of the California National Guard were composed of
his new Democracy, according to his view, and Re
publicans refused to heed the call of their country
and State! It stretches one's credulity to believe that
after being called unpatriotic cowards by the Mayor
the Republicans of this city will indorse his characteri
zation of them by giving him a single Republican
vote. Let him get his votes from his party. His slur
at Republican patriotism is, we believe, the first in
sult of the kind that has been uttered. It is a charge
that membership in the Republican party is inconsis
tent with the love of country and with the instinct
which ' : the flag. It is a charge that the coun
try would have been without soldiers and the flag
vvould have lacked defenders had it not been for
Mayor Phelan and his party.
By the way. the Mayer is of military age. There
are evidences extant of his virility. But it is not re
corded that he resigned an office and rushed to the
front, like the unthinking warhorse into battle. Hav
ing abided at home, intrenched in official dignity be
hind a corps of card-passers who must be seen before
he can be reached, how has he earned the right to
impeach the patriotism of Republicans? Roosevelt
resigned an office to enter the army. Hamilton Fish
and members of the Astor family left their millions
behind to enlist as privates, and some of them died
fighting. The fact that they, too, inherited their
wealth did not quench their sense of obligation to the
nation whose laws protect their property. They did
not content themselves with presiding at meetings and
making pretty speeches, but they went out to fight.
If Mayor Phelan is so sensitive on the subject now
why did not his patriotic feeling overcome him a year
ago? If he had put on his sword and baldric, belt and
war harness, then, people would be patient under his
criticism now. But he did not. Major Geary did not
find him in the Philippines. The Call started the first
movement for the equipment of the Red Cross So
ciety. Republicans poured money into its treasury,
Democrats. Mr. Phelan as Mayor of the
city had proper respect shown to his office. In all
the activities and hospitalities shown forth by our
people, as Mayor he was given proper place. He
seems now to make the mistake of taking all this as
personal and not official, and both he and Mai or
Geary show a deliberate purpose to coin it into po
litical capital. No one can reasonably object to the
magnifying of his own spectacular and oratorical ser
vice by the Mayor. To laud himself is natural with
him, and as he is acquainted with his subject and loves
to present it, no one would deny him the opportunity.
But when he goes beyond this and attacks the pa
triotism of the whole Republican party there is re
vealed a malicious disposition and a narrow mind.
His offense is heightened by the fact that he has been
at every election repudiated by a sufficient number of
his own party to have beaten him, and has been al
ways elected by Republican votes, as he expects to be
now. It remains to be seen whether Republicans
will ratify his contempt for their patriotism and his
vicious attack upon their courage.
In the meeting in winch he let loose this vile ac
cusation there were discordant notes. Dr. Dodge de
nounced the voting of a straight party ticket as a relic
of know-nntbirgism. Will the doctor publicly tell of
the occasions on which he has voted ior Republican
candidates, or will he dodge?
Mr. Cummings, candidate for Auditor, followed and
urged most strenuously and with every appearance of
anxiety that those present vote "the straight Demo
cratic ticket from top to bottom." So the four-and
twenty blackbirds each sang a different song. They
agreed in one thing â that Republican votes are neces
sary to elect them, and therefore advised Republicans
to snub their own ticket. But Democrats were or
dered to vote the party ticket straight.
The telegraph companies have blocked the way
against San Francisco's efforts to obtain either of
j the Presidential conventions, but in the near future
â  the obstacle may be overcome. There is such a
' tiling as wireless telegraphy in the world, and it 13

lon's motion to amend the address of the Commons
to the Queen by a request that the controversy be
submitted to arbitration was defeated by a vote of
322 to 54, the minority being composed mainly of
Irish members and a few extreme radicals like
Labouchere.
The Liberals, from whom a stronger opposition
might have been expected, contented themselves with
declarations that peace might have been preserved
had the Ministry been less aggressive and more just
in dealing with the Boers. Sir Henry Campbell-
Bannerman, for example, who holds the position of
leader of the opposition, declared: "The Government
is engaged in a game of bluff which is not a worthy
one for a great country like this. The raising of the
suzerainty question was utterly unnecessary and did
more than anything else to remove all chance of suc
cess of the negotiations." Nevertheless Sir Henry
went on to say: "Actual hostilities have commenced,
and an active aggression has been committed, which
it is the plain duty of our Ministers, of Parliament and
of the people to resist. There will be no disposition
on the part of this House to place any obstacle in
the way of granting such supplies and such power 9
to the crown as may be necessary to secure the rapid
and effective prosecution of a war commenced to
vindicate ottr rights. The campaign should be vig
orously and promptly prosecuted, and nothing neces
sary for that purpose should be refused by the House
of Commons."
When the leaders of the opposition speak in that
strain it is clear the Government is to hive a free
hand in carrying on the war. Whatever may be re
quired of men, money, ships or arms will be fur

nished to General Buller as promptly as the power
of the empire can raise and forward them. The war
spirit has taken hold of the nation and Parliament
reflects the popular passions and acts upon them.
Weak as the minority is in Parliament, it managed
through its orators to score several times in the de
bates on the address, and some of the words of the
opponents of this latest movement for empire and
aggression will have a wide influence in forming
public opinion outside of Great Britain. Dillon's
plea for international arbitration, for example, is in
line with the growing sentiment of the civilized
world, and there will be a general agreement with
the statement of Labouchere that if there had been
no Cecil Rhodes or if Salisbury had been in the
Colonial Office there would have been no war.
"There is too much stock exchange about the whole
business," said Labouchere. It would be difficult
to express more truth on the subject in as terse a
phrase.
The debate followed in the Lords the course taken
in the Commons. There is no radical party in the
Lords, and as the Liberals there made no opposition
to the Conservatives the Ministry had an easy task.
Lord Kimberley, speaking for the Liberals, con
tented himself with condemning the manner in which
the Government had carried on the negotiations, but
concluded that since war had come his party would
not oppose the Ministry in prosecuting it. Thus
the peace party in Great Britain appears to have
vanished utterly. Cecil Rhodes, Chamberlain and
their supporters have had their way. They have
flung against the Boers the whole weight of the
British empire, and now exult in the prospect of
making themselves masters of the gold mines of the
Transvaal by destroying the independence of the re
public.
About the only recent event in California which
has been given much attention in the East was the
use of wine to fight the forest fire in the Santa Cruz
Mountains. They seem to be very proud on the At
lantic coast over the fact that they are citizens of a
country that has a State so rich the people can fight
tire with claret, and we may yet hear it is the cus
tom in some parts of California to sprinkle lawns
with it.
THE Providence (R. I.) Journal, in commenting
upon the British policy in South Africa, re
bukes the expression of American sympathy
with the Boers. It says: "Whatever may be the
final issue between Great Britain and the Transvaal,
there can be no doubt of the duty of the United
States in the matter. That duty is to preserve abso
lute neutrality. The expressions of sympathy with
1 the Boers which some injudicious persons are put
ting forth will breed rather than avert trouble. As
lor the petitions sent to Victoria and Lord Salis
! bury, they are at once futile and impertinent. It is
. a very good rule to mind one's own business." Other
\ organs of American imperialism hold forth in the
j same strain and treat all expressions of American
' sympathy with the Dutch republic as unpatriotic!
They refer with contempt to the liberty-loving Boers,
brand them as unfit for self-government and as rep
. resenting the civilization of the seventeenth century,
and therefore with no rights deserving the respect of
: the civilization of the nineteenth century.
The Army and Navy Journal, the organ of the two
arms of military service in the United States, says:
"The best interests of South Africa require the suc
cess of the English in the present controversy, and
we should not put ourselves in the false position of
aiding the" cause of a people who, whatever may be
their abstract rights of independence, have no claim
upon our sympathies as a liberal and progressive
people." All this means that Americans must accept
the British view of the controversy and must give
no expression to their sympathy with a brave people,
only two hundred thousand strong, who are under
arms in defense of their independence and right to
self-government in a territory which their courage
conquered from the wilderness, and their love of
liberty dedicated to freedom.
James G. Blame said: "Nothing is more danger
than the forced transfer of territory carrying with
it an indignant and hostile population, and nothing
but a necessity proven before the world can justify
it. It is not a case in which the power desiring the
territory can be accepted as a safe or impartial
judge." England has always claimed to be the sole
judge of the propriety of her aggressions. She
stood in that attitude to our Revolutionary fore
fathers, whom she forced into revolt by denying to
. them the rights of Englishmen under the British
constitution. Her feeling at that time was long
after expressed by Robert Southey in his "Life of
Nelson." Southey was a lad of ten when our
Revolution closed, yet in his maturity he wrote in
the life of the hero of Trafalgar that: 'The Ameri
can colonists had broken the ties of blood and lan
guage and acquired the independence which they had
been provoked to claim, unhappily for themselves,
before they were fit for it." Now the organs of
American imperialism, in a spirit that may be called
insolent, demand that American citizens concur in
the British view of the issue with a young republic,
though it is exactly the same that England held
' toward our ancestors. Contrary to the wise rule es
tablished by Mr. Blame, she sets herself up as the sole
judge in the matter. But what disquiets and sad
dens an American is the order issued to our people
to hush their expressions of sympathy with their
fellow republicans, the Boers.
Heretofore we were the only nation on earth to
which the weak could turn for sympathy in their
battle against the strong. When the "United Irish
men," the combined force of Catholic and Protestant
Ireland which Grattan had joined to fight for liberty,
was in the midst of the struggle of 1798, Thomas
Jefferson at an official dinner gave the toast, "Suc
cess to the United Irishmen." That toast expressed
American sentiment for all struggling people willing
to offer their lives for independence and self govern
ment. Hitherto its expression has been unchecked
and unrebuked. It has been the cause of the ad
vance of republican institutions everywhere. In its
light absolutism has been transformed into constitu
tional monarchy in every country in Europe except
Russia and Turkey, and in them all the people have
acquired elective voice in legislation. Since Eng
land resisted our forefathers and denounced them as
unfit for the independence to which they aspired
thirty republics have arisen in the world in which, in
the language of Mr. Blame, "the right of the people
to govern themselves, the fundamental basis of re
publican institutions," is recognized.
England is in battle array, ready to use her
mighty power to efface two of these republics, and
we, in whose example they were founded, are com
manded to give our sympathy to the oppressor and
withhold it from the oppressed.
Surely we have sadly changed since we gave to the
world our reasons for declaring the Spanish war.
The shortest and surest road to municipal progress
and reform is by the practice of straight politics in
the support of the straight Republican ticket

MARCONI AND WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY.
Success of The Call-Herald in Using the New System Excites All
Kinds of Newspaper Comment.
The Call-Herald success In far outstripping all newspaper rivals by giving
the earliest and most accurate bulletins on the Columbia-Shamrock yacht race
by means of special wireless telegraph service has attracted the attention of the
newsgatherlng world. Marconi and his system and its uses and advantages are
at present subjects of all sorts of comments. Below will be found some of the ex
pressions of opinion gathered from newspapers in different sections of the
country:
â¢ â¢ â¢
Dolbear Will Miss the Laurels.
San Diego Tribune.
Professor Dolbear says he discovered wireless telegraphy before Marconi. Then
he has been strangely backward in demonstrating the practicability of his in
vention. For the present it is probable that the young Italian need not fear
that Dolbear will get any part of his laurels.

Marconi's system of wireless telegraphy Is no longer a vague theory, but
will now take its place at. the head of the greatest inventions of the age.

Marconi and Dolbear.
Columbus Press Post.
Though Professor A. E. Dolbear of Tuft's (Mass.) College is an Ohio man
he Is an alumnus^ of Ohio Wesleyan â his claim that he discovered and secured
patents covering the processes of wireless telegraphy years ago, and that Slgnor
Marconi Is infringing on his rights, is not likely to be championed largely in the
Buckeye State nor anywhere else. Granting that what he claims is true, his
failure to see how it might be applied and to push it is sufficient to lose for
him all the credit to which tho. discovery would In itself entitle him. Marconi is
really discovering wireless telegraphy to the world that has been waiting to use
it, even though Dolbear knew the principles involved and tested them to hia own
satisfaction years ago. The American Indians might with as good right as Dol
bear has claim that they, and not Columbus, were the real discoverers of the
Western Hemisphere. They were here first.
â¢ â¢ *
Wireless Telegraphy.
Philadelphia Times.
Experiments in wireless telegrapny made during the International yacht
races appear to Justify some general conclusions with regard to the usefulness
of this mode of electric communication. Marconi, who may be considered the
inventor of the practical system thus far developed, has himself directed the
transmission of dispatches between a steamer accompanying the yachts at sea
and a station at one of the lighthouses on shore, whence they were again trans
mitted to New York. It is conceded, of course, that this aerial telegraphy can
not, for various reasons, supplant that by wires and cables; but the fact that
intelligible messages can be thus transmitted at all, with reasonable directness
and accuracy, is in itself important.
Many circumstances can be imagined under which this system would be
valuable where wires or cables do not exist, as between ships at sea or between
a ship off shore and the land, or where communication by wire or cable has been
interrupted. The most obvious limitation of the system in its present develop
ment Is in the lack of privacy. A message sent from one station might be
picked up at any numbor of other stations. Rut it is q-uite conceivable that
this may be overcome by future invention, the experiments already made having
already indicated to inventors the direction in which they are to work.
The military uses of wireless telegraphy are somewhat problematical. In the
navy, as among scattered vessels of a squadron on a cruise, its adaptability ap
pears less doubtful. Thus far the invention has not passed the stage of curious
experiment. In communicating between points that are or can be connected
by a metallic conductor, nothing is likely to be gained from the new system.
Yet so much has been done with it in so short a time that it would be foolish
to set a limit upon its possible development.
The Call and Wireless Telegraphy.
Healdsburg Tribune.
One of the greatest, |f no t the greatest, discovery of the waning days of the
nineteenth century Is the wireless telegraph. The use nf wireless telegraphy In
the evolutions of the English fleet in a great measure proves its efficacy. Dis
patches were sent a distance of sixty miles with apparent ease, and the reporting
of the international yacht races, flfteen miles at sea, the connection with land
wires and reporting of the movements of the contesting vessels a distance of
3000 miles and posting them on the bulletin boards of the San Francisco Call in
three minutes after the events- transpired. Is truly astonishing. The scientific
question involved is. Is the transmission of dispatches by wireless telegraphy due
to the passage of the electric current through earth or air, or is it due to the
vibration of ether waves? Hertz has given us ether waves millions of miles long
and 400.000.000.000 of vibrations for dull red light. The uses to which wireless
telegraphy can be put are practically unlimited. The cutting of land wires, either
in advance or in the re-ar of an advancing army, would be of little effect, as a
communication could be held over the heads of the opposing armies. There ia
also another question Involved. Would not the erection of a pole and receiver at
any point within a limited distance also receive the dispatches intended for
other ears, thus doing away with the secrecy of the telegraph? Marconi, the
Italian inventor whose system is being used, is a personal attendant on the
yacht races, and will at their conclusion conduct a series of experiments for
our Government. At present we can but conjecture the ultimate of the system.

HARRIES' THRILLING YARN
DOUBTED BY THE POLICE
His Fight With Burglars Be

The Young Bank Clerk Still Being Closely
Guarded by His Parents to Prevent
His Being Questioned.
THE sensational story told by Harry*
Harries of his desperate tight with
burglars, whom he had discovered
In his home, is discredited by the
police of Oakland. They are moral
ly convinced that he was alone in
the "fight" and that he slightly wounded
himself in order to appeal In the role of a
hero.
Harries" story was that he was awak
ened shortly btfore 4 o'clock M
I morning by a noise in the dining
' room. Taking his rifle, he quietly slipped
! out of his room and proceeded to make
!an it;-. â  On going: downstairs, he

started to press the electric button which
lights up the house, when suddenly one of
burglars opened fire on him. The
shot, he - ;l over his head and
through a large mirror.

burglar. Then tnnued what he terms a

possession of the rifle he and the desper

Harri< - claims that he linally succeeded

close to the heart. Although fatally
i wounded, as he thought, he raised his

They promptly returned the fire, ten shuts

WILLEY CONTEST HAS
NOW GONE TO TRIAL
Attorney Lyons Says the Deceased
Was of Sound Mind and Worked
for Him Several Months.
The Jury to determine the issues raised
In the contest of the will of the late
Charles Walter Willey was completed
yesterday morning and In the afternoon
the taking of testimony was proceeded
with. Those selected as Jurors are F. L.
Dunlap, Robert Currie. James J. Hayes,
Samuel G. Buckbee, Spiro Radulovich,
Hubert Cleary, D. J. Standish. John J.
Duffy, Samuel H. Heller, E. H. Hanjes.
Jacob Deutsch and Henry Schoenb.-rg.
The facts leading to the making of the
will by Willey, in which Mrs. Louisa M.
Muirhead is named as sole devisee, are
well established. Willey was practically
an outcast, disinherited by his father and
uncared for by his relatives. One day he
approached Mrs. Muirhead on the street
and asked for assistance. She was im
: pressed by his appearance and took him
| 10 her place at Larkin and Hayes streets
and gave him employment. Later it de
! veloped that he had a legal claim against
his father's estate, suit was â¢ filed and
judgment was entered In his favor for
about $su.u)u. An appeal was taken to the
Supreme Court by tne heirs ol tne estate
ana the order of distribution setting aside
this portion of the estate for the .benefit
vi Charles Walter Wllley was adjudged
invalid. A motion for a rehearing was
made however, and granted. The case
' was argued before the Supreme Court in
bank last August and was submitted with
the Fair case, the questions arising on the
trust provisions of the wills being identi-
I cal This matter is still under submission
before the upper court, and even though
it should be decided against Charles \V\
Wllley a claim of hi., estate against that
of his deceased mother prill stands as an
Incentive to carry the contest to a anal
decision. ; , , . .
\V K. and R. Springer, uncles, and Ab
bie W. Bridgham and Sarah C. Sharrer,
aunts of the deceased, are the contest
ants Their allegation that Mrs. Muir
â  head led young Willey to believe that he
I had no relatives to inherit his property
and thereby Influenced him to devise her
his entire estate is a tacit admission on
their part that they did not, as alleged by
Mrs. Muirhead, ever assist him and stood
with the rest of the family against its
! black sheep, Charles W. Willey. They
I claim, however, that Mrs. Muirhead,
knowing that Willey was heir to a por
tion of his father's estate, simply kept
i him in order to inherit his property when
â¢ a disease with which he was afllicted
1 finally carried him off. They also alleged
that he was of unsound mind and that
Mrs. Muirhead took advantage of his
weakness for the purpose of defeating his
legal heirs. These claims were set at rest
by the first witness called yesterday.
'Timothy J. Lyons took the stand and
stilled that for eleven months prior to
| Willey's death he employed him in his*
I office, assisting him in his legal business.
He also gave the facts regarding the
I drawing of the will and testified as to the
! gratefulness of Willey for all Mrs. Muir
head had done for him. Mr. Lyons re
: futed the statement that Willey v.-as of
unsound mind and pointed to his capacity
; for legal work in proof of his contention.
After a lengthy cross-examination Lyons
I left the stand and an adjournment "wan
] taken until this morning.

PHOTOGRAPH NO. 1 OF YELLOW TURPITUDE.
Anticipating a renewal of falsehood from tho Examiner, The Call took the
precaution Tuesday during the progress of the international yacht race to turn
I the camera at different times on the yellow fellow's bulletin board. The first
result is shown above. By comparing the bulletins marked 1. 2 and 3 In this fac
simile with bulletins 4 and 3 in the succeeding, you will be able to detect the
Examiner in as much falsehood as you know arithmetic. You will see it
chronicling events half hours before they happened and. later on, floundering In
a. futile attempt to set itself right. Especial invitation is given to compare duI
letlns "1" and with each .other, and every other photographed. >â¢ -,-

that the race started over thÂ« triangular
course at 11:01 o'clock, Now. the yellow

he posted the news of the Shamrock's
mishap at 9:07, San Francisco time. Nine
and three make twelve, and you nave
12:07. Yet he tells you at the very begin
ning of his first page story of the race
that "twenty-live minutes after the Irtish
yacht had started her topmast carried
away." Twenty five minutes added to one
minute after 11 o'clock makes ll:2o o clock,
and any schoolboy an figure out that
three hours off would make it 5:26 o clock
in San Francisco.
Which lies, the yellow kid, or fig
ures? Is he correct in his first page
story, or in his third page "freak?"
Is he correct in either? Doesn't he lie
in every spot? j
Marconi's bulletins sent to The Call say
that he doesâ say that he lies in his
â¢â¢freak" and fakes in his story. Fac
similes of two Marconi telegrams received
and posted by The Call at 8:29 a. m. and
8:33 a. m. Tuesday, San Francisco time,
show that the shamrock's top hamper
was carried away at 11:27, New York
time They also show that the yellow kid
lies when he says The Call posted its
bulletin of that event at 9:28 a, m. San
Francisco time.
The Call offers these fae-similrs to dis
prove that part of his lie and stands
read" to give $1000 to any charitable in
stitution designated if it cannot prove
every word it has said' regarding them.
For fear, however, that these might not
be enough. The Call took care to make
copies of the yellow kid's bulletins of the
yacht race, to his confounding. The thir
teenth bulletin he posted Tuesday morn
insâ unlucky 13 - or tho little bratâ read:
N.-. V. At 11:35 a. m. the Sham
rock's towering topmast broke and
the giant topsail was carried away
out hung in the wind over the star

That bulletin was posted here, as The
Call has means of proving, at 8:48 a. m.
San Francisco time, At 8:31, San Fran
cisco time, the yellow kid posted this one:
N. V.. 11:40 a. m. â Erin coming

THE SAX FHATsCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 19. 1809.
MARCONI TELEGRAMS TO
CONFOUND THE EXAMINER
BULLETINS THAT REFUTE YELLOW MENDACITY.
In bold black type the Examiner announced on Its third page yesterday that it was the first newspaper in San Fran
cisco last Tuesday morning to bulletin the accident by which the Shamrock lost her tophamper in the race with the Columbia
In bold, black type it asserted that at precisely 9:Â« o'clock. San Francisco time, it posted the news, and that The Call did
not follow suit until 9:2S o'clock, fifteen minutes later. The above messages from Marconi are offered in far simile to smoth
er the yellow kid's lie. As Indicated by the handwriting under each they were received and posted by The. Call at 8:29 a m
and v:::; a. m.. respectively, Tuesday. The Call has absolute proof to this effect and stands ready to give to any charitable
institution designated by the Examiner $1000 gold coin if thai paper can disprove the fact. It cannot. The Examiner lied
as it has lied before, when it printed that black type. The tele rams bear no marks except those of the Western Union Tel
egraph Company, by which they were delivered. Any one doubting their genuineness can have his doubts removed by the
same agency.

photographed to convici hi n. Fac-simlles
of them, taken at different sti
are publish* d h< i ewit h.
Notice the bulletin marked "!" In the
left hand margin of the photographic re
production. It reads
N. V.. 12:04 p. m. â Columbia turns
first boat.
The (.'all admits that the yellow kid put
wonderful bnrt=t of Bpeed with that
( last your eyes on his pi
bulletin "5," and you will tind no dnilcuity
explaining it. Bulletin marked
reads:
N. V., 12:50 p. m. â Corrected time
of Columbia in rounding first mark
was 12:45.
At 12:04, New York time, mind you, 9:04
here, the yellow kid admits on his photo
graphed bulletins that the Columbia
rounded the ttrst stakeboat. If you will
remember his third-page freak, he Bays
it was at 9:07, San Francisco time, he an
nounced the loss of the Shamrock's top
hamperâ and that opens up a deal of in
teresting arithmetic. For example, on the
yellow Kid's bulletins the Shamrock lost
her topmast at 9:07, San Francisco time,
three minutes after the Columbia nan
turned the first stakeboat. In the kid's
first-] age story he says the mishap to the
Shamrock occurred twenty-five minutes
after the start. Now, you subtract three
minutes, the difference between 9;04 and
9:07, from 25 and you have 22 minutes,
which equals the time the yellow kid pays,
according to his freak or his fake or his
bulletin, whichever you choose, it took
the Columbia to beat to windward and
turn the first stake.
It Is estimated that on that beat the
Columbia covered fourteen miles. The-
Examiner on its first page yesterday says
on this point:
"Her time was little short of marvelous.
She covered the course in three hours and
thirty-seven minutes, the beat, ten miles
to windward, in one hour and thirty-nine
minutes."
Whew! What a feeling of relief the yel
low kid must have had after dreaming he
had sent the Columbia the full distance ;
of that beat to windward in twenty-two
minutes, to wake up and find that it had
taken her the "marvelous" time of one
hour and thirty-nine minutes to make it.
Will the little yellow dog admit that that
lie of his is choking him? Come, now.
there's a nice little yellow doggie!
And that's not all the arithmetic con
jured tip by those 12:04 p. m. and 12:50
p. m. bulletins. A littl" direct compari
son between themselves will do no harm,
except to the- yellow kid, and he appears
even now to deserve all the harm possi
ble. In the 12:04 bulletin he states posi
tively that the Columbia turns. The 12:50
bulletin states that the corrected time of
the Columbia's turning was 12:4:"..
Under which bull, little Bezbnian?
What? Nayther! Oh. well, never mind!
Let's pass to the next one.
Ladies and gentlemen, the little yellow
dog Is off his feed. While he is coming
to give your attention to photographic
bulletin No. 3. It reads:
N. V.. 12:27 p. M. Columbia's
sails drawing -well and she is rapidly
approaching second mark.
Bear in mind that, according to the
yellow fellow's bulletin last pointed out.
Columbia's corrected time of turning of
the first stakeboat was 12:45 p. m.. and
here and now, with a simple twist of the
wrist, the kid say? that at 12:27 p. m. she
is "rapidly approaching the second
mark." Excuse the pun, ladies and gentle
men, but isn't that re-mark-able. Werry!
What a magician the yellow kid is, to be
sure. While Columbia was turning the
first stakeboat at 12:45 p. m., he had only
to Fay presto and she was approaching
the second mark eighteen minutes earlier.
Some designing persons, ladles and gentle
men, may try to convince you that the
kid is no magician and that the boats
were racing the wrong way of the course,
but don't you believe 'cm. The kid'sâ
the k who threw that egg? No gentle
man, certainly:
Now, cast your eye on photographic bul
letin marked "2." It reads, as you can
see:
N. V., 12:45 p. m. â Excursion boats
gathered around turn to watch Co
lumbia go round.
And this one. marked "4":
N. V., 12:45 p. m.â Columbia made
cut very close to second mark. 'Â
And this one again, marked "5":
N. V., 12:50 â Corrected time cf
Columbia in rounding first mark was
12:45.
Ladles and gentlemen, It begins to look
really as If that nasty little yellow brat
had made a mistake. In photographic
bulletin marked "4" he undoubtedly say.?:
"At 12:45 Columbia made out very close,
to second mark," and here. In the very
next bulletin, marked "5", he says: "At
12:50' p. m. â Corrected time of Columbia
in rounding first mark was 12:45."
Here, you little measly yellow cur, how
do you dare play hocus pocus with the
people? Whack! whack! whack!
leavens, he's done for! Ladies and gen
tlemen, the yellow kid has choked on
that last photographic bulletin.
HI, there, sonny! Hurry up with that
chloride of lime.
And. ladles and gentlemen, if you will
put clothespins on your noses while they
are carrying out the carcass and cast I
your eyes on bulletin marked "6" in the I
photographic reproduction you will find I
that it bears a wonderful likeness to bul
l-tin marked "4." Sou would say tiny ;nv>
twins. Just thirty-five minutes apart, you
will notice, and although tin- Columbia
had been racing like mad for that second
PHOTOGRAPH NO. 2 OF JAUNDICED MENDACITY.
A close or.mparisnn between bulletins "4" and "5" on this photogranhic re
production of part of the Examiner's bulletin board on last Tuesday's race be
tween Columbia and Shamrock v.-ill show the sorry straits in -which the yellow
kid foumi its<if in it.- efforts to cope with The Call's service from wireless
telegraphy. In "4" it has at 12:45 p. m.. New York time. "Columbia made out
very close to second mark from shore." In "5," the second bulletin later, at
12:50, it naively announces "Corrected time of Columbia rounding first mark was
12:45." Â£o that it had the defender in two places, ten miles apart, at one and the
fame time, 12:45. Arrah, go wan!

Another photographic reproduction of bulletins posted last Tuesday by th#Â»

from bulletin "6," thirty-live minutes later, she had progressed to "within threS

The Pacific Mail Company's steamer
San Jose sailPjJ for Panama and way |
ports yesterday at noon. Among 1 the
cabin passengers were: Colonel Tisdale, i
the Mall Company's Central American
manager; J. Carpentler of Carpentler &
Co., ..lanzatlan, and DrÃ. Haas and
- Bailey. The â  -m of Carpentier & Co. is
. a very wealthy one and the head of the
house, has been in San Francisco on the
lookout for a suitable steamer to run be
tween Mazatlan and this port. Very few
' steamers are in the market Just now, but
. as soon as the Carpentlers can procure
one there will be an opposition boat in the
Mexican trade. Dr. Haas was to have
I sailed with his family on the Curacao for
Mazai but on the morning or their
intended departure his daughter was
found asphyxiated in her room. The fam
: ily home is at Mazatlan.
The Harbor Commissioners will soon be
i pin to tear down Howard street wharf No.
'i. It is the intention to rebuild it with
cylinder piies in 1 make a- structure simi
; lar to the Government wharf out of it.
Colonel Long intends to ask for the new
wharf for the transport service. There is
not enough accommodation at Folsom
street wharf for the vessels at present in
thÂ»} service, and Captain Barneson says
that the new wharf is an absolute nee 3
i sity for the transport service.
. Yesterday Captain McCoy, superintend
' f>nt of the Spreckels tugs, began moving.
I The valuable wrecking plant of the con
! cern was taken to Hathawav's wharf and
: stored, while the ofilce books and furnl
| ture went to Pacific street wharf. In fu
; ture the tugs, will share that structure
| with the Oceanic Steamship Company, and
Captain McCoy will have his office at the
: hf>ad of the wharf. The Naval Reserve
steamer Marion will be moved out In the
stream, and then the work of tearing
down Howard No. 3 will begin.
C. D. Lane, the millionaire mine owner
and "King of Cape Nome." is going into
the wrecking business. The mishaps of
the steamer Laurada on her last voyage
to Cape Nome were told exclusively in
The Call on the arrival of the steamer
Townsend from the north. Since then the
Laurada has gone ashore on one of the
Prybiloff Islands and become a total
wreck. She is lying in such a position
that most of her cargo can be salved, and
Millionaire Lane Is going to try and do
the trick. He has put the Townsend in
commission again and will start to-day
for the Arctic. Captain Frank "White of
the wrecked steamer is going as a pas
p'-neer, and with the appliances aboard
it is expected to save nearly all the mer
f handise. Mr. Lane owns nearly 150 tons
of the stuff In the wrecked steamer, and
if he succeeds In getting it out will hurry
with it to Capo Nome.
JOHN B. HITE ON THE STAND.
Mariposa Millionaire Swears That the
Indian Woman Is Not His Wife.
John R. Hite, the Marlposa millionaire
mine owner, yesterday wont on the wlt
â  'â  d that tho Indian
unman Lucy, who claims to be his lf>pal
grht to that title and never
had. lie admitted that ho had lived with
an Indian won, Mary before he
knew Lucy, and that afu-r she had dipd
in his home he had paJd fur her burial
the grave wherein she was buried.
He admitted that Lucy had lived with
him at Hite's c;>vo. but denied that she
i -. . -r ate at the same table with him. She
was not his wife, and yet he could not
that she was a Bervant.
Mr. Hiw- emphatically declared that hÂ«
knew Rev. Father Williams, or
that hr- had ever admitted to him that
Lucy was his wife. 11.- also denied that
he had ever referred to Lucy as hi? wife
in conversation with John \Y. Wilcox in
this city. In fai t, the only thing he
would admit in connection with his rola
with th" Indian woman was that
id paid all her bills.
Dr. William T. Bell and Dr. Henry R
Bell of this city testified that they had
never known Lucy as the wife of Mr
Hite.
ARRESTED FOR DEBT.
Herbert Peterson Apprehended on
the Honolulu Boat.
Herbert Peterson, a prominent young
business man of Honolulu, was arrested
by Bheriff Martin yesterday afternoon as
he was about to take the steamer Aus
tralia for the islands. He had been for

feared he. was leaving in an attempt to
dodge his obligations. He was taken be-
Justice Kerrigan, to whom he fur
nished sufficient evidence that his funds
gone, and at the same time prorn
(sed to make good as soon as he reached
Honolulu. He was allowed to catch his
boat.

FOUND DEAD IN BED
BY HIS DAUGHTER
HALLECK V. DEMING.
HALL.ECK V. DEMING, one of the directors in theDeming-Palmer Mill-
Ing!"' mpany, was found dead In bed by his daughter Florence yesterday
morning at 10:30 o'clock, at the family residence, 714 Ellis street,
Death had occurred some time during the night from natural causes.
Coroner Hill was notified, and after a personal Investigation decided
that the body should not bo removed to the Morgue.
Mr. Doming had been suffering with disease ever since his return
from Europe, about two years ago. He was a confirmed invalid and confined
to his room during that period. He has never been quite the same since the
death of his wife in Paris, three years ago. Dr. Chismore, who has been at
. g him, states that Mr. Deming's heart was weak, and death evidently
resulted from an attack which gave him no time to warn the household.
Mr. Deming was C 3 years old at the time of his death, and besides his daugh
ter Florence leaves a son, William, who is employed in the milling company.
His two brothers, F. O. and J. G. Deming, were associated with him In busi
ness, and they are all favorably known in commercial circles.
Halleck Deming was born in Shelby ville. Ir.d., March 8, 1536, and in 1552 he
crossed the plains with his two brothers, and arriving at Yreka they engaged
in mining in October of that year. In 1866 they came to San Francisco and
succeded In building up an immense milling business.
The d^ad man was a member of tne Merchants' Exchange and the Produce
Exchange, both of which organizations will take action in respect to his mem
ory. An autopsy will be performed on the remains to determine the exact
cause of death, a? Mr. Deming carried a large insurance during his life time.
It is estimated that his fortune, which ho acquired In the flouring business,
will aggregate o\
SUPPLEMENTARY
MINING BUREAU
NOW PUNNED
Plan for the Miners'
Convention.
Pthe date for the State convention of
alifornia Minors' Association, which
s next Monday, approaches, new
are appearing in the Held and in
creasing the pro:r.ise of an interesting and
Important gathering.
One plan which is being Incubated by
sev< ral members and which will undoubt
edly be urged before the convention is
that of enlarging the scope of the work of
the big association in the State and mak
ing it a larger and more con
stant force in the mining field
by establishing permanent headquarters
which shall be more than an office with a
eign on the door announcing the sÂ»'cre
tary's place of business and which shall
be to the mining industry something like
what the State Board of Trade has been
to the interests of agriculture a.nd horti
culture. Many leading and uctive mem
bers of the association have long recog
nized the need and opportunity for this.
It is proposed by some of the enterpris
ing ori's that a bureau !>. established and
maintained by the association which shall
be first and foremost a bureau of live in
formation concerning the mining Industry
in California and also a p!uec v ut which
mining men of all parts of the State would
drop in when they com.? to the city, as
they do daily by the scores. There should
be a reading room and library, supplied
with all the mining; and State journals, an
accumulation of the latest mining maps
and works of mining reference, ana possi
bly the beginning of a mining exhibit. It
should be a â¢'place for pointers" for min
ing men. Secretary Renjamin has well
suggested that there might be a free State
register of practical mining men of all
grades, from drill men and mine foremen
to assay era, mine surveyors, etd which
would Instantly supply any employer, at
the associations expense, with the names
and references of men of the kind wanted.
There are almost numberless way? in
which such a bureau might be made of
great value to the industry and a credit m
the ;Kmi> members of the booming as
tion. Such an institution would supple
ment and not conflict with or detract from
tait rathi-r assist the Si:it<> Mining bureau,
whose functions ar.Â» limited. Then- thus
appears the possibility of what would be
practically a new and important State in
stitution.
Some people will propos.- that some lead,
ing bans i"> mad>- the treasurer this year.
The badges which will )<â¢â  worn by the
delegates will be handsome ones, consist
ins of a pan, pt-ndru'.t from a crossed pick
and shovel. Secretary Benjamin had yes
terday received notice of the appointment
of 594 delegates, with three counties
the Bouthern California brand) yet to
hear from. The Governors of six western
States have reported the appointment of
delegates. Governor Gage, the entire Cal
ifornia Congressional delegation, David
Starr Jordan and Benjamin Ida Wheeler
arc among the eminent men who have re
ceived invitations to also attend and
speak. The thr 0 will be a
big and interesting affair.
Riles Snarls. E. C. Voorheis, F. F.

candidate for the presidency. j H being
urged to run for another t^rm as vice

B N Shoecraft of Nevada County has
been expected to ho a rival to R. H. Ben
lamln for the secretaryship, hut it is re
porte* now that Shoecraft will m>t run.
and so far Benjamin seems to have a
walkover ahead. The convention will this
year be held in Golden Gate Hall, on Sut
ler street.
Benefit of St. Brendan's.
Arrangements are in rapid progress for
tlie coming benefit which is to be given
by the young men of St. Brendan's par
ish. Every effort is being made by the
committee in charge to make it one of
the grandest Bticcessea of the season. The
concert will take place In N. S. G. W
Hall on Saturday evening, October 2S.
Some of the best local talent has been
procured for the entertainment and one
of the city's leading orchestras will ren

Exhibits for Paris.
The first of the exhibits of California
products for the International Exposition

PLAY: LOVE'S LABOB'S LOST.
I.â Story of the Play.
The King of Navarre, "the sole Inher
itor of all perfections that a man may
own," has made a vow that
Till oainful study shall outwear three years,
No woman may approach his silent court.
Three gentlemen of the King's court
have sworn that "for the three years'
term" they will "live with him as his fel
low scholars." One article of the vow or
oath reads as follows:
Item, if any man be peÂ«>n to talk with a wo
man within the term of three years he shall
endure such public shame as the rest of the
court can iicssibly device.
Presently there comes to Navarre, in
tending to visit the court of the King, the
noble and beautiful Princess of France,
attended by three noble and beautiful
ladies. The Princess is upon an embassy
for her father, the King of France, who is
old, feeble and ill.
The King of Navarre and his three
courtiers are dismayed. They do not wish
to be unkind, nor do they wish to deny
themselves the happiness of meeting these
noble and beautiful ladies. And yet they
do not wish to be forsworn of their oath.
Finally, since necessity knows no law,
they agree to be forsworn of their oath
this much: They will meet the Princess
and her train without the precincts of the
court; but the ladies are not to be admit
ted within the precincts.
When the meeting takes place the King
and his three courtiers fall In love with
the Princess and her three ladies respec
tively. But for shame's sake they will
not confess their loves to one another. In
the end, however, through a series of mis
adventures, they become acquainted with
their common predicament and they unite
upon a common plan to obtain the favor
of their loved ones.
The Princess and her ladies also find
out about the gentlemen's predicament
and determine to have some merriment
over the affair. So when the King and
THE STREET IN WHICH SHAKESPEARE LIVED.
his courtiers, in the disguise of Musco- |
vitea, visit the Princess and her ladies the \
Princess and her ladies also disguise
themselves. The result is that every one j
of the four gentlemen makes love to tho
wrong lady.
When subsequently the gentlemen visit
the ladles in their proper guise and again
declare their loves the ladies merciles.-ly j
laugh at them for their former blunders. \
In the end, however, the lovers are all I
accepted, but only on condition of each i
doing a year's penance, as, for example,
retreating
To some folorn and naked hermitageâ
this not only because of the broken oaths j
but also to show that their love is lasting, i

A Neglected Comedy.
"Love's Labor's Lost" is perhaps the
least read of Shakespeare's comedies; and
for this neglect it is easy to assign a
reason. The play, probably Shakespeare's
first attempt in independent dramatic
composition, is, on the surface at least,
of a quite different character from his
other comedies. While these deal with
the lasting attributes of human nature
and find their humor in the perennially
ridiculous aspects of men's character,
"Love's Labor's Lost" is a satiric fling at
contemporary follies and provokes laugh
ter by its caricatures of figures and
fashions well known to its first hearers,
but as forgotten to the average reader of
to-day as the heroes who lived before
Agamemnon. Just as "Patience" some
years back swept over England and
America in a peal of merry mocking
laughter, but has already passed away
Into the dark backward and abysm of
time, so this play of Shakespeare's, which
once set the pit of the Blackfriars theater
roaring and sweetly commended itself to
the fancy of good Queen Bess and the
learning of wise King James, is now to
all Intents dead past hope of resurrection
from the shelves of the library to the
boards of the stage. The allusions to the
fantastic Monarcho, to the dancing horse,
to the last fashionable licentious poem,
all ring hollow to-day, and when Shakes
peare's merry gentlemen belabor the long
forgotten fashion of pedantic and affected :
speech the reader is inclined to cry with
Armado: "The sweet war man Is dead
and rotten; sweet chucks, beat not the ;
bones of the dead."
And yet for the student of Shakespeare '
"Love's Labor's Lost" has a peculiar in
terest. It was the special favorite of the
young Goethe and his circle of Shakes
peare worshipers at Strasburg. Schlegel,
the great champion of the romantic
school in Germany, spoke of it as a model 1
comedy of the finest wit and the most i
delightful mirth. Xor has it been without ;
honor in his own country. Coleridge says: |
"If this juvenile drama had been the only j
one extant of our Shakespeare, and we
possessed the tradition only of his riper
works, how many of Shakespeare's char
acteristic features might we not still have
discovered, though as in a portrait of him
taken in his boyhood." Charles Lamb \
loved it as the comedy of leisure, "most
nonsense, best sense"; and Pater has de
voted to it one of the most charming of 'â 
his charming appreciations.
History of the Play.
All critics agree that "Love's Labor's i
Lost " is one of the earliest of Shakes
peare's plays, and some of the highest i
authorities rank it as his first independ- j
ent work. General consent puts the date
of its composition somewhere between 1559
and 1592. We need not trouble ourselves j
about the exact year. When we know j
that we have in "Love's Labor's Lost" 1
one of the earliest if not the very first of !
Shakespeare's creations in the field of !
poetic comedy we know enough.
The statement that it is one of his !
earliest creations applies, however, only 1
to the first draft of "Love's Labor's Lost"
and not to the drama as it lies before us ;
to-day. On the title page of the first
edition, a quarto, published in 1559, we \
re "A Pleasant
Conceited Comedle
Called
Loves labors lost.
As it was presented before her Hlghnes
this last Christmas.
Newly corrected and augmented
by W. Shakespeare."
"Newly corrected and augmented"â for
when her gracious majesty deigned to â¢
cast the radiant beams of her favor upon
the young dramatist, whose wit, pathos
and Bentlmtnt were packing the play
houses in the suburbs, and commanded
a performance of his popular dramatic
satira for the entertainment of her court
on Christmas day, it was not for him to
present it in its first rough form. It must
be retouched and decked out with such 1
ornament of ringing verse as the author
of "Romeo and Juliet" and "The Mer
chant of Venice" had at his command.
It is not hard to discover some of the
additions that Shakespeare made to the
play in 1397. The characters of Rosaline
and Berowne must have been strength
ened, and It is possible that the figure
of the pedant schoolmaster wa3 added as
a companion- piece to the pedant curate
of the first sketch.
Points of Special Interest.
In spite of what has been said above
as to the comparative lack of interest of
this play for the general reader, there
are few comedies of Shakespeare's that
will better repay a ciose and sympathetic
study than "Love's Labor's Lost." It is
a play of beginnings, and we may see in
it the art of Shakespeare in the germ, or
rather in a bud just unfolding, sweet in
Itself, and full of glorious promise. It is
a play of youth: the young king, the
young princess, th.-> young amorous lords
and ladies dominate the scenes. And in
the flash and parry of the weapons of
young wit we catch the mind of the
young poet. And it is a play in which
the personality of the author shines out
through the thin veil of the hero, and we
see. If not exactly Shakespeare himself,
Shakespeare as he wished himself to ap
pear in the eyes of his mistress.
Shakespeare's Art in the Play.
The dramatic art shown in the con
struction of the plot is of the very slight
est. The story, drawn no one knows
whence, is a mere peg on which to hang
a spangled robe of wit and poetry-. A
King of Navarre decides to turn his court
into a little Academe. He and his fol
lowers take vows to study hard, to sleep
little, to fast often and above all to shun
the society of women, in order that they
may drink deep of the delights of learn
ing and earn in their lives the fame that
shall "live registered upon their brazen
tombs." But the best laid schemes, even
of a studious King and his bookmates,
"gang aft agley." A Princess of France
comes upon the scene with her ladies, as
an ambassadress from her old father. Of
mere necessity the late-made vows are
broken. The King and his lords enter
into parley with the Princess and her la
dies, and no sooner enter into parley than
they fall in love, and no sooner fall in
love than they begin to -woo their mis
tresses. The ladies, not ignorant of the
vow rashly made and quickly broken, re
pay their court with merry scorn, till at
the close a graver note strikes across the
silver laughter, as a messenger announces
the death of the King of France. "Ine
Princess retires to a year's sojourn >n a
mourning house, and for a twelve
months' space the lovers must wait for
their answer. "Our wooing doth not end
like an old play," says the irrepressible
Berowne. wilh half a sigh for the pen
alty assigned him. "Jack hath not Jill "
And so for the year at least love's 1 bora
lost. Could any plot be lighter, slighter
brighter? '
Even in the character drawing we B*e
the prentice hand, not without promise
indeed, of greater things to come, but
still the prentice hand. The King and the
Princess are graceful but shadowy figures.
There is not a hair to choose between
Longaville and Dumain, or between Kath
erine and Maria. Even the humorous per
sons of the playâ Armado, Holofernes.
Costardâ follow along lines strictly laii
down in the old comedyâ the braggart, tho
pedant and th~ clownâ as, indeed, they are
sometimes called in the first edition. But
if any one wishes to see how much of the
wine of wit Shakespeare has poured into
these old bottles, one has but to compara
Armado with his prototype. Sir Tophas,
in Lilly's "Endymion." Only in the figure*
of Berowne and Rosaline, where the pren
tice hand has been reinforced by the mas
ter's touch, do we feel ourselves in tha
presence of a pair of Shakespeare's men
and women, so much more alive than th<3
crowds that go about the stieet and
make aa though they lived.
Berowne, in especial, is a masterpiece
His ready wit, his firm hold on the fa<ns
of life, his unquenchable good iiumo
mark him as one of the characters that
Shakespeare loved. He subscribes the oath
presented by the King with a laughing
protest against its ideality. He falls in
love and jests at his own folly.
"What, I! I love! I sue: I seek a wife I"
Âr^ Ui iU Wl J, at d - hu mored malice aoes he
upbraid his fellows when their broken
vows came to light: with what easy grace
does he contess the fact when his own
love-caused perjury is revealed. How elo
?hf n m J t'ii le i de^ en^ s , the oath-breaking of
the little band of lovers and extols its
From woman's eyes' this doctrine I derive-
They sparse still the right Promethean flre :
They are the books, the art.-;, the academes,'
That show, contain and nourish all the world.
Unconquerably sanguine he rises above
each rebuff of his mocking lady, and ac
cepts with whin-si- al resignation her sen
tence "to jest a twelve-month in a hos
pital. If anything was wanting in his
character it was a little more of the milk
of human kindness, a little more open
eyed perception of the suffering in the
world. And this we feel that he will gain
He will finish his year's penance not a
sadder, but perhaps a gentler man
Rosaline, the first of the ma.l girla "that
mock their lovers so," is a fair portre~-3
of that temple of the comic spirit More
than a match in the fence of wit for Be
rowne himself, yet always preserving a
certain decorum which lifts her above
most of the characters of the play sh<> i 9
as wise as she is witty. She knows tho
worth of her lover, and his weakness aa
well, and with unerring instinct lavs her
finger on the spot. When she turns upon
the man "replete with mocks, full of com
parisons ar.d wounding flouts" and dis
patches him to
Visit the speechless sick and still converse
â With groaning wretches; and your task shall
be,
With all the fierce erideavor of your wit
To force the pained Impotent to smile,
wo feel the justice as well as the severity
of the sentence, at once a punishment and
a remedy.
Dr. Brandes sees in Rosaline and Be
rowne the first sketch of Beatrice ami
Benedick, and there is a certain similarity
In the situation. But when we hear Rosa
line exulting over her lover's plight and
promising herself all the jnys of a pretty
tyrannyâ "This same Berowne I'll torture
ere I go"â we are irresistibly remind-1 ot
a gentler lady than Beatrice and a wittier
maid than Rosaline herself, the pretty
page of the forest of Arden, who led Or
lando through such a mad cure for the
madness of love, being "effeminate
changeable, longing and liking; proud!
fantastical, apish, shallow, inconstant
full of tears, full of smiles, for every
passion something, and for no passion
truly anything." The dawn of Rosaline 13

Boer War and Gold Supply.
The New- York circular of Henry Clows nays:
"War between England and the Boer re
publics has become a certainly. The notable
fact that the event has been attended with
lit t "e or no aggravation of the financial Blt
uatlon in London shows that the worst out
come of the warlike contingencies had been
discounted in advance. In fact, the ending of
the suspense seems to have brought relief
rather than aggravation. This war contin
gency has been a cloud overhanging the srt
uation both in Europe and this country for
quite a long period, and so tar as we are con
cerned It may be considered as having been
fairly discounted. The way in which we would
l.c most affected would be by the stoppage of
gold remittances from the Transvaal to Lon
don, which last year amounted to 562.000.000. If
England does not get these remittances to
strengthen her gold supply, it will make it al
most Impossible for thla country to draw much,
if any. gold from Europe meanwhile, as it will
be resisted by the Hank of England and Con
tinental banks; consequently, we are liable
to get In payment for any commercial trade
balance due us a return of securities instead."
Dried Fruit in New York.
Mall advices from Now York say:
"Prunes are selling more freely, and there
have been sales of ten carlots within the past
two days. Negotiations are In progress for
etill larger sales, with promise of speedy con
summation. No holder will sell 90s. They are
short; held at a premium, and the price is
tending upward. There is a premium on 40s
also. Most sales are of the three sizes in
ett-ad of four, a? usual, and holders are not
anxious sellers of the three sizes. On the
coast there is no disposition to urge sales.
Holders are inclined to anticipate higher
prices on all sizes later.
"Tenches continue firm and choice are mov
ing upward. Pales were reported yesterday
at 'it'VÂ«c advance on choice, but the lots were
t-malf and chiefly f^r immediate consumption.
On the coast up to Tc is ... choice
In bacs. f. o. 1). A further advance is likely
as storks on hand clean up. The supply is
luree, but demand appears to Tw> sufficient to
consume everything likely to crae on the mar
ket before the next season's crop is ready for
delivery.
"Apricots are out of first hands and prices
rule strong on lots In second Hands. Some
pa'es have been made here at the recent ad
vance, but they were chiefly of small quanti
ties and excited but little influence on the
market.
"Raisins arÂ» qul<>t at present. There re ne
gotiations pending for large sales, but so far
ns known nothing has bÂ«Â»en closed. Transac
tions are in small quantities at present and
represent the requirements of relatively small
handlers. Most of thÂ«Â» packers have disposed
of "â¢". per cent of their allotment, and an cau
tious about taking further orders. It Is un
derstood that several orders wired to the coast
â within the past day or two have been turned
down, owing to the Inability -of packers to fill
them."
The ll ax Market.
The circular of Somers & Co. says:
Receipts of Hay have been quite light for j
the past week as compared with weekly re
.in.s for the past few months, the total be- !
ing something under 3000 tons. This falling !
iff has lit-en caused partly by the recent rain- |
ptorm and partly by the grea.t trouble in se- |
curins transportation. Thf railroad company,
with Increased fariiiti*?, does not feem to be
able to handle the freight offered it, more par
ticularly .is there Is much fruit being shipped
ut this particular tlr:ie of yt-ar, and prefer
ence seeina to be >;i\fn perishable products.
}'. r the last thrr-o days but twenty-one <ar
loads have arrived, although there Is a cry
lor cars all over tho country. There is yet
quite a quantity ci lf;ty out of doors, and ;
altl)' ush some little of It haÂ« been damaged j
to such an extent that it will not b* market- j
cl hÂ»re, yet the bulk of what still remains I
out will anon be baled, weather permitting. I
end will be forwarded to this market as fast I
as cars and boats are provided. Because of |
the comparative scarcity of Hay on the mar- j
ket there has been a somewhat better feeling
noticeable, and without doubt prices will be i
advanced 50e to $1 per ton shortly If receipts,
do not Increase.
"Alfalfa continues to drag along with re- |
ceipts ranging quite tree, about one-third of 1
the total for the week, or about 1000 tons, be- I
ing of t.'-.is particular grade. I
"'The future' of the murket Is a matter of :
pome speculation, but our opinion Is that the ;
prices for tho better qualities of both Wheat !
and Oat Hay will be from EOc to $1 per ton j
better than vo hnve been noting for a week ;
past. Tho medium grarlf.s may be expected to \
(â "nt'.nuc- witlmut change, while the poorer |
grades and the damaged Hay, which will i
probably Le in evidence, will tell at lower
rates than we have noticed up to this date

EASTERN MARKETS
New York Stock Market.
XKW YORK, Oct. I*. â There was a oon^i.W
ence on the prtrt of the
â¢ 'ks to-day and the market
c:!r.p.' t be ; . â¢ mctprtze.i otherwise than
engtn was decidedly spotty,
â¢ irly hour?, but thÂ«> tone
â¢Uadily Improved and the demand lor stocks
In the late dealings became rather urgent. A i
striking- evidence of underlying strength was '
the indisposition of the bears to contest the j
advance. This was notably true In the group j
of Industrial stocks which was made the tar- ;
get for attack yesterday. Thus It will be seen :
that the glucose stocks, the members of the ,
Iron and steel group. People's Gas and the local
traction stocks, which have of late been quite
persistently pressed by the bear faction, all
show rather striking gains. Another feature j
of the market was the fact that the few stocks
that were picked out to be manipulated for a <
rise d!d not hold their gains well, although the
advance seemed to effect the desired purpose
of inducing sympathetic strength at other
points in the list. The bidding up of the Van
derbllt group is a time-honored maneuver
among- the professionals to signal a bull move
ment. Northwestern, Omaha, New York Cen- j
tral and the minor Vanderbllts all came Into â 
the movement and the Union Pacific stocks i
trailed on as usual. The coalers were also ;
employed as a leader. In the railroads the j
strength was not widely diffused, although the ,
general tone was quite firm. The grangers, j
added to those already specified, would about
complete the list. The various tone displayed
by Sugar and Brooklyn Transit had a large
influence, owing to the volume or' the tran- I
sactions in them.
The gains in Louisville, Southern Pacific and
the Baltimore and Ohio stocks are small and
Pullman and Great Northern preferred show |
sharp losses on the day. There was no special j
development in the day's news to account for j
the market's strength. There was no renewed ,
s-tringency In money, but there was no actual j
replenishment of New V irk's diminished cash j
supplies. Foreign exchange In New York ad
vanced sharply, causing some renewal of talk
of gold exports. The simultane>rus advance of â 
sterling exchange here and in Paris and Ber- .
lin indicated the drawing in by London of out
standing resources in reparation for war ex- j
penditures. The meager supply of cotton hills, j
very unusual at this period, is also a factor I
In the strength of sterling exchange. The
scarcity of ship room; owing to the British
Government's demands for transport service,
is cite . as the cause.
The market for bonds â¢â â â â¢.- moderately active
and showed numerous points of strength.
Total sales. $2,230,000. United States old 4's

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, Oct. 18. â Wheat was stead}-, fol
lowing higher Liverpool cables, light receipts
and the oversold condition of the local market,
coupled with the theory that after such a sea
son of continuous declines a natural reaction
might reasonably be expected, encouraged suf
ficient buying tor the moment to add a little to
the opening advance. The demand was limited,
however, and this finally became so sluggish
that the market began to sag for lack of sup
j...,rt. Then the bears took hold and succeeded
In wiping cut the advance and forcing a %c de
cline. At this point a report from the sea
board that houses with connections In India
were buying heavily of low grade wheat stimu
lated a buying movement. Selling pressure
grew less pronounced as the session progressed,
and the market toward the close was strong,
final figures being the best of the day. Small
estimates for to-morrow and heavy clearam iÂ»s
helped the advance. December opened %.@^4c
higher at 703ifÂ§70%c. advanced to Tic, declined
to 70 Â»c and rose to 71% cat the close.
Corn ruled dull and lower the greater part of
the session. There was a great deal of liquida
tion, encouraged by a slack shopping demand,
but toward the end the firmness In wheat Im
parted a little animation to buying and the
loss was fully recovered. December closed with
buyers at 3(i%c.
A good cash demand, buying by elevator In
terests and the advance in wheat strengthened
oats. Trade was acvtive. December closed at
22% C.
Provisions held steady on a limited trade. The
absence of liquidation which has depressed the
market of late, was the main factor in the
strength shown. January pork closed 2%^j&c
higher at $9 40@3 42%.; January lard and ribs a
shade higher.

Boston Wool Market.
BOSTON, Oct. IS.â The American Wool and
j Cotton Reporter will say to-^iorrow:
Renewed activity and strength have devel
i oped in the wool market since a week ago,
and It is safe to say that the situation as a
whole to-day presents the strongest appearance
seen In years. The business of the weÂ»>k foots
up a total of over 8,000,000 pounds, which is
certainly a most remarkable record, in view
of the fact that the large worsted mills in the
combine have not been among the purchasers.
There Is no mistaking the strength of the sit
j uation and the tendency of prices. If there
I was anything wanting to demontsrate beyond
any doubt the underlying strength of the posi
; tion of wool In the world's markets, It has
i been the remarkable activity and advance in
| Australia. The Sydney market Is excited and
firm, and Continental buyers have been taking
: wool at almost any price. At the Melbourne
sales there was a large attendance and very
active competition at advanced prices. There
Is a world-wide demand for fine wools and fur
; ther exportations of fine Territories are likely
! to occur.
The sales of the week In Boston amounted
; to 6.718,000 pounds domestic and I,3o2,ooo foreign,
making a total of 8,020,000, against a total of
4,446,000 for the previi us week, and .i total of
i 3.299,000 for the corresponding week last year.
Sales since January 1. 1599, amount to 238,974,100
pounds, against 91,941,010 pounds last year at
j this time.

NOTHING LEFT
OF THE LARGE
DINGEE PLACE
Fernwood Is Wiped
Out by Fire.
Francisco Call,
. I "i. 18.
Wh, :: Mr. and Mrs. W. J. Diagee arrive
the East on Baturday they will find
princely home, Fernwood, a mass of
ashes, out of which are now standing
ihlmney stacks. Probably a couple
of hundred thousand dollars has been ex
. .gee on this palatial
home and Us contents, for he has been
for mi a collector of rare pictures
and oi nament*.
A Bhort time ago two valuable paintings
were rejnovt-4. to the vault in Mr.
gee's office, and tLese are all that remain
of the collection of years.
This morning: about 1 o'clock some of
Mr. Dingee' employes, who sleep on tha
premises, returned home from a dance
and retired, noticing nothing unusual.
Shortly afterward Robert Armstrong,
who represents Mr. Dlngeo during his ab
sence, discovered that the house was In
liames, but no one is able to tell how long
it had been burning before the discovery
was made. Armstrong says he does
nut believe seven minutes elapsed
after he discovered the ilames before the
ruin of th place was complete. The build
ing was a three-story structure and con
tamed nineteen rooms. As an example
ot the luxury with which the place was
furnls it may be mentioned that a
new ceiling for the library ot polished
mahogany was recently put into tno place
which cost $2500 in New lurk exclusive or
tho labor necessary to have it put in
place, Every room was richly finished
and elaborately furnished. me of the
sleeping rooms had cost over $o(M), and all
through the house were expensive Orl
tntal furnishings and costly articles from
almost every country under the sun.
As soon as the lire was discovered the
half dozen men who are employed on the
place pressed into service all the garden
hose that could be found, but the blaze
was so tierce and had such a good start
that the effect of the water hardly ex
tended the time necessary to reduce the
mansion to ruins. The few little streams
that were played on the flames were
turned into steam before they reached
the lire.
Fernwood was originally the property
of Colonel Jack Hays, and it came into
the possession of Mr. Dingee about eleven
years ago. Since that time Mr. Dingee
has expended a princely fortune upon it,
and surrounding It are several magnifi
cent conservatories, miniature lakes and
beautiful fountains. The home was fitted
with a complete electric plant, which fur
nished hundreds of lights to the house,
grounds and outhouses. There was not
in California a more magnificent home
than Fernwood, although there are many
larger.
No one is able to give a reason for the
fire. Mr. Armstrong', before retiring,
about 10 o'clock last night, saw that all
the doors and windows were locked anil
thnt there was no light in the house ex
cept the single gas jet in his room. No
suspicious persons had been seen prowling
around the grounds, and the only theory
hitherto advanced is that some of the
electric light wires must have started a
blaze. There were no hydrants near the
house, and Armstrong' says that Mr. Din
gle had ordered some, but they had not
yet been put In place. When Armstrong
heard the crackling nf the fire he awoke
and thought some one was breaking into
the house. When he opened the door of
his room he was greeted by smoke and
flame, and nlthouch a hand fire extln
pulsher was but live feet away he could
not reach It without endangering: his life,
and even then it could have rendered no
service. The â¢ 'â¢â â¢phone was destroyed be
fore It could be used to send to Oakland
for help, and although the glare could be
seen In the sky. not until Coachman Den
nis rode Into town was ft known which of
the few large residences In the hills had
been destroyed.
The insurance on Mr. Dlngee's h<->UF<>
nmountei to $f!0.noo. and is placed with
the Royal Exchange, the Royal, the Im
perial and the Sun.

The evidence for the prosecution was
about the same as ... at the Coroner's
inquest. Joseph McAulifTe, the murdered
man's brother, testified to being In
Flynn's saloon, Twenty-fourth and Ala
bama streets, with Mitchell and his
brother and others, and Mitchell asked
him to pay a bill for groceries. They had
v dispute about the amount of the bill,
and Mitchell went to get his books, but
returned v.-ith a revolver. He pointed the
revolver at witness twice and then fired
i:t Frank. On cross-examination he de
nied that any one lick Mitchell.
Abe Goldenson. a tractor at 816 Flor
ida street, testified that he heard Mitch
ell Fay to J<><? McAuliffe that he could
"prove it." Mitchell went away, and as
he was returning he saw Fra/ik run to
ward him and try to snatch something
out of h!s hand. Mitchell made for Joe,
and witness went back Into the saloon.
As he was coming out again he heard a

Policeman Tryon testified to having Â«eon
Mitchell go back to his store, and shortly
afterward he heard a shot. He took a
revolver from Mitchell and placed him
under arrest. Mitchell's face and collar
were covered with blood and his chin and
lip were cut and bleeding.
This closed the case for the prosecution,
and Cap'ain Oil!r-n was called for the de
fense. He testified as to the condition of
Mitchell's face when taken to the station.
The case was continued till next Wednes

NEARLY ASPHYXIATED.
John Sullivan of Vallejo Narrowly
Escapes Death.
John Sullivan, a Grand Army veteran,
who came here Tuesday from Vallejo in
search of employment, narrowly escaped
asphyxiation yesterday in his room at the
New Washington Hotel on Fourth street.
He was discovered just in the nick of time
by the hotel clerk and hurried to the He
celvin? Hospital, where DrÂ». Dray and
Starr restored him to consciousness.
Sullivan had been drinking a little dur
ing the day and late in the afternoon he
went up to his room to take a nap. About
6 o'clock last evening the hotel clerk was
attracted to Sullivan's room by the odor
of escaping pas. On breaking open the
door he found Sullivan lying on the bed
partially dressed. One of the gas cocks
was turned on full.
Whether or not Sullivan attempted to
commit suicide is not known, but the
probabilities are that he turned on the gas
accidentally or blew It out instead of turn
ins? It off.
Sullivan appears to be about 70 years of
n&e and the physicians Bay the chances
for his recovery are very favorable.
SULLIVAN, THE
BURGLAR, HAS
COME TO TRIAL
Additional Counsel for
the Accused.
ALAMEDA, Oct. IS.â The preliminary
examination of Charles C. Sullivan on a
charge of attempted burglary, with a
prior conviction, was begun this morning
before Justice of the Peace Morris. To
accommodate the large number of people
desirous of witnessing the case the court
room of City Recorder St. Sure will be
used. The examination of witnesses pro
ceeded very slowly, but four being exam
ined during the day.
Samuel Sullivan, a brother of the pris
oner and his wife, Eva Sullivan, were
present and showed considerable Interest
in the proceedings. When the court ad
journed for the noon hour both of them
greeted the prisoner, and Mrs. Sullivan
kissed him. Mrs. John Martin was pres
ent, as is her usual custom at preliminary
examination of a 'sensational character
in Alameda. She was accompanied by a
lady companion. A young lady residing
on Pacific avenue, who had never had the
experience of witnessing a trial, watched
the proceedings from the open door of the
Juiipt's chamber. A large delegation of
the colored population was present and
seemed to be greatly interested in the
case. Captain Jainieson and Captain Ma
loney, both former oflicials at San Quen
tln, were among the spectators.
The first witness called was A. O. Gott,
proprietor of the store where the attempt
ed burglary took place. Mr. Gott told of
leaving his store at 8 o'clock on Sunday
evening, October 8, and of seeing that the
doors were locked and bolted, and of his
return to the store Monday morning after
reading of the attempted burglary, He
identified a number of tools found on the
two burglars as his property. These were
the tools supposed to have been burglar's
tools at the time of the capture of Sul
livan.
Harry Tenney was recalled and Attor
ney Crowley proceeded with the cross
examination. Tenney testitled that he
waited half an hour after he first heard
a noise in the rear of the building before
he left to give the alarm. He told of his
return along Park street from the police
station; of his telling Officer Rogers, who
went with him and stationed himself in
front of the jewelry store, and of his as
sisting Hadley over the fence by the
church into the alleyway. He himself
climbed up on the fence and saw Hadley
enter the gate Into the yard back of
Gott's store. Hadley went to the rear
door if the store and opened it. Hadley
was standing about live inches from the
back of the building when witness saw a
flash and heard a report of a revolver, but
could not tell whether it was fired in
front of Hadley or behind him. He could
not say how close the flash was to Had
ley, but it was in the open doorway. Had
ley red a shot and retreated toward the
fence. When asked if Hadley was acting
like a man with some one after him when
he cam out, or was taking his time, wit
ness answered that the officer was hurry-
Ing. Hadley proceeded to the gateway on
Centrnl avenue. Tenney stated that he
heard five or six shots. Three or four
shots were fired, then, after a slight
pause, three or four more shots were fired.
Tenney's testimony about Hadley hurry-
Ing to* the fence seemed to amuse Mrs.
Sullivan, ns it caused her to laugh.
Officer Hadley was next put on the
stand. He repeated the story of Mr. Ten
nev giving the alarm, etc. He told of en
tering the yard In back of the store and
of opening the back door of the store. He
could discern the outlines of two dark
objects, but could not distinguish who
they were. He heard the click of two re
volvers and immediately fired in the di
rection from which the sound of th.- clicks
came. The burglars immediately com
menced firing at him. firing four shots,
his gun refusing to work, and after try
ing to cock It he retreated and tried to
force open the gate, spraining his shoul
der in the attempt. He climbed over the
fence and while doing so took a look back
and saw one of the burglars, who he had
reason to believe was Sullivan, following
him. When he got over the fence he
turned around and saw one of the burg
lar?, whom he Identified as Sulivan. look

THE SAN Fl? AN CISCO CALL, TIIL'KSDAY, OCTOBER 19, 1899.
S
THREE PUPPIES THAT HAVE
A BRILLIANT WAR RECORD
OAKLAND, Oct. IS.â No three puppies in the State have
had more exciting experiences than three little mongrel
brindle pups bruoght from Manila to Mrs. Crawford
Letham of 549 Park avenue, East Oakland. The doggies
were born in the trenches around Manila, and until they
arrived in the city of churches they had been accustomed to
little but the noise of shot and shell. Since landing here they
; have been so impressed with the quietness that surrounds the
many church spires that they have tried hard and with much
; success to make enough noise to persuade themselves they are
; still amid the exciting scenes of their early days.
The animals have distinct military records, the father being
Punch, the brindle bull terrier mascot of the First Washington
Kegiment, which recently returned from Manila. The mother
is Fanny, a Scotch terrier, and the mascot of Company C of
It ho same regiment. Fanny enjoyed the reputation of being
puoh a clover chicken thief that she could supply her com
pany in camp with fresh hen for breakfast every morning.
at the corner of Central avenue and Park
street lie was able to distinguish the man
on the fence and Is positive it was the
prisoner. He could not tell whether the
man had on a necktie, but he had on dark
clothes he had a dark mustache and a
dark stubby beard. "Witness leveled his
gun at the man and he dropped back be
hind the fence. When asked by defen
dant's attorney how he expected to kill
both men by firing toward the spot
whence the sound came, witness said he
had no expectations as to how many he
would kill. "I fired first. They were ad
vancing toward the door when I fired.
They continued to come toward the door,
shooting as they advanced. My gun re
fused to work and so I got out." Wit
ness stifled to seeing two distinct flashes
from two distinct revolvers. They were
about four feet apart. Hadley stated it
was not his shot that disabled his re
volver but the shot fired by the burglars.
A piece of hard substance got in between
the cylinder and the body of the pistol.
Witness did not save the obstruction.
Counsel asked witness if he expected any
one to believe that when he aimed a re
volver that was out of order at the man
on the fence the man would drop back.
Tfadley answered that the man did not
know the sun would net work, and asked
counsel to i lace himself in the same posi
tion. â¢ .. .
Crowleyâ l suppose you could have
used a bottle of cocktail with the same
effect.
Hartleyâ l don't know. Tf you were
on the fence I think you would be able to
distinguish a bottle of cocktail.
Hadley repeated that he was positive
the man on the fence was Sullivan, and
that he had a dark mustache. Tills
caused Sullivan to smile, and turning
toward his brother he winked at the lat
ter. in referring to the shot ITadlev re
reived in the finger, Crowley said: "Now.
Mr. Hadley, do you mean to say that you
did not shoot yourself?" Hadley answered
â â¢I do."
An adjournment was taken until 9
o'clock to-morrow morning.
It is evident from the manner in which
Sullivan's attorney is proceeding that his
defense is to be made along the line that
i Sullivan did not enter the store where
; the burglary took place.

Originally this little family consisted of four puppies, but one
was killed by a Filipino bullet before it was many days old,
and In the same engagement Fanny received a wound on one of
her fore legs, the scar of which she will carry to the end of her
life.
It was during the engagement in which one puppy was
killed that Stanley Delango, brother of Mrs. Letham, and two
other privates of Company C forgot the seriousness of battle
for a moment and stooped to pocket one of the puppies. But
for this little act the doggies would have been trampled, to
death. The pups were afterward returned to camp and were
brought to Oakland by Private Delango, while Punch and
Fanny are again In quartera at the Prfpidio, waiting f'>r thrir
regiment to be mustered out. One of the pups is yellow, an
other white and the third of a dark tiger color. One of them
will go to the sergeant of the regiment, a commissioned officer
claims the second and the third will remain in the possession of
Private Delango.
The lady alleges that she had a claim
against the bank, and that she will, rot

the bank to oust Mrs. Cottarell. and if
she does not get out to-morrow the
Sheriff will be called upon to put her out.

OF ODD FELLOWSHIP
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, 00S Broadway. Oct. 18.
Two of the most Interesting delegates to the Odd Fellows 1 celebration to
morrow will be Zacharlas Ludwlg, the oldest Odd Fellow In California,
and Frederick Bchlmmelpfennig, whose combined years in Odd Fellow
ship reach exactly a century. Mr. Ludwig was initiated in 184S and
Mr. Schimmelpfennig In lÂ»50.
Zachariaa Ludwlg was initiaterl December 10, 1848, in Pittsburg, Pa..
in Lodge No. !â¢">. Which shows how few lodges there were at that time. He
has always beeil an active number of the order and ha? hold many high ofÃces,
and although now of advanced age his health is splendid, but no better than
his memory. He has organized two lodges In the East, and was the founder
of the Vorwaerts Lodge of Oakland. lie was also the founder of the first Re
bekah German lodge of Oakland, and was elected its noble grand. The Re
bekab lodges, as a rule, have lady sfflcers, but in this instance they were
obliged to take a gentleman In order to teach and organize. This was twenty
two years ago. Last December Mr. Ludwiu was tendered a golden Jubilee In
this city by brother Odd Fellows, ami an Invitation was senl to his original
lcdyv at Pittsburg, which sent him an elegant gold Odd Fellows' badge for i
watch^harm By the Yorwaerts Lodge he was presented with a gold medal
inlaid with the Odd Fellows' insignia.
Frederick S. himmelpfennig joined the Odd Fellows of the German Colo
nial Order in Albany. N. V., in 1850, and six years later came to Oakland. He
found in this city about fifty unattached members of the order, who wore very
anxious to have a meeting place. Mr. Schimmelpfennig offered to build, and
bis offo r was accepted. Pie erected the first I. O. O. F. hall in this part of the
State on his own property, at East Twelfth street and Fifteenth avenue. He
built a residence adjoining the hall, and the two buildings are among the old
est in this city.
Mrs. Schimmelpfennig is also enthusiastic in the raupe of Odd Fellowship,
and, with her husband, Delieves very firmly in its principles.

bed of the railroad track of the Southern
Pacific Company's line to San Jose at Bos

another of the federation's achievements,
as were also the advocacy of several new
schoolhouses in the district, the improving

ST. BRENDAN'S FAIR.
Father Nugent Says It Will Posi
tively Close To-Night.
The attendance was so large last night
at St. Brendan's Fair that the ladles In
charge of the various booths found It im
possible to hold the drawings for the
many articles which are to be raffled
off. A large number of chances were pur
chased by the charitable visitors and
Father Nugent decided that it would be
necessary to keep the fair open for one
night more in order that affairs may be
wound up satisfactorily to all concerned.
He states, however, that the bazaar will
positively close to-night. A special musi
cal programme is In course of prepara
tion and It will be a gala closing. Father
Nugent desires to extend his heartfelt
thanks to all those who have assisted in
making the fair the success that it was.'
JUDGE EDGAR
INDIGNANT AT
JUDGE ALLEN
Fines His Office for
Being Tardy.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
90S Broadway. Oct IS.
For the first time on record the District
Attorney's office was lined $50 yesterday
jby Justice of the Peace Edgar. An ex
| amination in a felony charge was set for
i yesterday morning in the Berkeley court,
; and although all other parties were pres
| ent and ready to proceed, no representa
tive from the District Attorney's office
; appeared, i.or was any excuse sent or re
quest for a continuance.
Judge Edgar waited a reasonable time,
j but hearing nothing, he declared that the
District Attorney's office was in contempt
i of court and imposed a fine of $50 on tnâ¬
office.
It transpired later that a deputy bad
been ordered to attend to the Berkeley
trial, but that a mistake had been mad.
in the time, and when this explanation
was made to the Judge he magnanimous
ly excused Disirirt Attorney Allen from
having to pay the $,"'â >.
This is the second skirmish that has
occurred within a few weeks between the
I District Attorney's office and the Berke
' ley court which is only just four
! months oki. Two weeks ago Judge Ed
p;ir took it upon himself to appoint an
official stenographer for the court, and
the bill for service was declared Illegal
by the District Attorney on the ground
that only the District Attorney can ap
point official stenographers in the Jus
tice's courts. This incident caused a
little friction which was not subdued by
the little event of yesterday.
ARCHITECT BENARD
TO VISIT BERKELEY
BERKELEY, Oct. 18.â Monsieur Benard
of Paris, the architect whose plans in the
Phebe Hearst architectural competition
were awarded the first prize, will visit
the site of the University of â  alifornia
probably some time early next month. A
cablegram was r%ceived at Berkeley to
day saying that the distinguished archi
tect left Paris yesterday. It is under
stood that Mrs. Hearst intends .o leave
for the East shortly. She will return in
time to consult with Monsieur Benard
during his stay in the university town.
The object of the architect's visit is to
look over the university grounds, prelim
inary to giving the final touches to his
plans before any part of them is put into
execution.
The plans themselves are soon to be
shipped to Paris to be exhibited at the
Paris Exposition. They will be given a
place in the section reserved for Frer.ch
architects Instead of going as a part of
the exhibit of the University of Califor
nia. The reason for this is 'hat the
amount of Bpace reserved for California
is much too Insufficient to give the de
signs the- display their Importance de-
Berved.
Censured the Institution.
OAKLAND, Oct 18, Coroner Mehr
mann went to Livermore last night to
hold an inquest on the body of Mrs. Levi,
the young woman who c^mmitti'd suicide
in a bathroom. From the testimony it
appeared that the attendant left the
woman in the room and that she locked
h< rself in. afterward hanging herself
with a portion of her apparel. The jury
supplemented this verdict with a sug
gestion that the management of the sani
tarium should adopt additional precau
tions, as many fatalities have occurred
at the institution during the past nve
years.

LECTURED ON THE
HAWAIIAN ISLANDS
Rabbi M. S. Levy Talks Entertain
ingly to a Large
Audience.
Rev. M. S. Levy, Rabbi of Congregation
Beth Israel, guided a large audience to
the Hawaiian Islands last evening and
the hour and a half spent in that beau
tiful land was of great benefit to those
who listened to the doctor's entertaining
talk. Stereopticon views of rare excel
lence were shown on a white canvas and
made the tour of the audience an inter
esting one.
B'nai B'rith Hall was crowded with the
members and friends of the Independent
Order of B'nai B'rith. It marked the
third reception of the season under its
auspices. As on former occasions it was
well attended and did much toward the
intellectual advancement of those present.
Rev. Dr. Jacob Nieto, chairman of the
committee having the affair in charge,
opened the entertainment with a short
address, in which he told of the effort
being made to educate and interest the
members and friends of the order. He
then introduced Morris Rose, who ren
dered a violin solo. This was followed by
a song, "Because of Thee," by Berthold
Tours, which Miss Hpymansnn artist
ically rendered. Miss Ella V. McOloskey's
contralto solo was enjoyed, as was also
Mr. Fleming's basso soln. All those who
participated in the programme were gen
erously applauded.
Dr. Nieto introduced his fellow-preacher
in a few well chosen sentences. The lights
were then turned out and Rabbi Levy
transported his audience to the land o"f
sunshine and flowers. The' speaker has
just returned from Hawaii and showed by
his lecture that while In that country he
had devoted his time to observation and
study. He described the various spots
he had visited and told of tho customs of
the natives. He eulogized the latter for
their hospitality, generosity and great
honesty. Throughout his lecture his audi
ence showed the deepest interest and
punctuated it with applause.
Credit is clue the following gentlemen:
Rev. Dr. Nieto, H. Rubins. S. H. Simon
A. Auerbach, William Cohen. H. Oustadt'

Celerity of movement characterizes the
Republican management of the campaign.
Tuesday night the executive committee
of the County Committee organized anil
authorized 'rmnn Alfred Pointer to
establish headquarters in suitable apart
ments. Yesterday spacious rooms were
secured in the Baldwin Annex and last
night all the nominees of the Republican
ticket met at the new quarters and con
ferred with the campaign committee. The
business on hand was dispatched without
delay and the nominees then mingled with
the large audience of Republican workers
there assembled. Flattering reports were
received from the various Assembly dis
tricts. Horace Davis earnestly impressed
upon the committee the necessity of dis
trict organization, and his recommenda
tions in his respect are being carried out
to the letter.
Every night of the campaign, excepting
Saturday night, there will Be three dis
trict meetings. Horace Davis is a veteran
campaigner and a wide-awake, up-to-date
man. whose mental and physical vitality
has not been vitiated by indulgence in the
luxuries of life. He is in prime condition
for an active campaign. It goes without
saying that the friends of reform, good
government and pure politics will give
him the glad hand and the rousing cheer
â¢wherever he uroes.
The blundering of Mayor Pheian is ex
citing the surprise of" Gavin McNah,
Franklin K. Lane and Jasper McDonald.
It almost passes belief that Phelan. who
â was elected twice by Republican votes,
phouM sneer at Republicans and Insinuate
that they did not enlist to serve the coun
try. He remarked contemptuously last
Monday evening that Republicans' were
Jill pr.trioLs but that Major Geary did not
Fee many of them at the Philippines.
A Phelan evening or^anette is following
the tactics of the Mayor. Horace Davis'
great battle to save the workingmen of
California from Mongolian competition in
the field of labor is spoken of in a slight
jig manner as 'Vhe:ip politics."
The campaign committee of the Repub
lican executive committee will 'meet twice

then Mayor Phelan, who had iust entered

his greatest support. He spoke dispar

Burch was slightly the worse for

Alas, poor Brown! In the olden days
of the Southern Pacific, when Stanford

i tributes. Time has wrought changes.
I Under the present regime of the Hunt

nected with the new array of offices in
the Wells-Fargo building.
One could say at first thought that Mr.

â¢ no room assigned to him for his special
I use and occupancy, but it is whispered
| on the inside of the yellow building that
I the name of Harvey S. Brown is not on
the pay roll of the Southern Pacific. No
one will say positively when his name
was erased or why the erasure was
ordered. The name was there for many,

A^ this Exchange is composed largely
of gentlemen who are themselves Inter

WHAT MR, DARE
HEARD OF OUR
CITY'S FUTURE
Eastern Capital Is
Looking Hither.
T'nited States Appraiser John T. Dare
has returned from a short visit to New
York City, whore he had gone to attend
a conference of United States Appraisers
from all parts of the Union for the pur
of making their methods nf exam
ination uniform, so that imports in one
j port would have no advantage over those
!in another port. The objects of the con
ference were accomplished and California
will be among the States most benefited.
The conference began on September 26.
in the new United States Appraisers'
store, corner of Washington and Christo
pher streets. The ports of entry repre
sented were: Baltimore. Chicago, Detroit,
Cincinnati, New York, Portland and San
Francisco.
The principal imports considered were
Bteel tools from England, earthenware
from England.; enameled ware from Ger
many and England and union fabrics of
cotton and fiax. With regard to these ar
ticlea a uniform system of examination
was decided upon, so that there will be
no room for further complaint on that
score The mode of determining the qual
ity of teas and that of the polarization of
sugar were also agreed upon, and are now
the same in all the ports of the Union.
The most important work done by the
conference was the exchange of statistics
regarding the increased business of the
United States during the present year. All
ports show a decidedly increased volume
of business. A remarkable instance of the
dawning of the era of prosperity was the
fact that during the first five months of
the present year the shipments of pianos
to the South and West were larger than
the sum total oi piano shipments for five
years previous to the Ist of January. L 899.
This' is a wonderful showing of general
prosperity, for pianos are a luxury, and
the added increase of luxuries is the
surest sign of prosperity in any country.
* Another fact pregnant with great results
for San Francisco and the rest of the
State is graphically expressed by Mr.
""Mfound San Francisco 2000 miles nearer
New York to-day than it was a year ago.
Tin- army of officers and soldiers who
hive passed through San Francisco on
their way to and from the Philippines
have learned something as to the climate,
resources and business possibilities of the
State and the metropolis. They have be
come really the advance agents of Cali
fornia's prosperity. Our State and our
city have become the subject of discussion
among the moneyed men of the East in
the hotel corridors and In the busln.ess
places The eye?, of Eastern capital are
turned on San Francisco ns the New York
of the West. Men of capital are making
close inquiry as to the advisability of in
vesting here, and of changing their resi
dence to the tar West. The battleship
Oregon has been a modern John the Bap
tist for the commerce of San Francisco.
Men of capital are asking about the water
power stored away in the Sierras and the
practicability of harnessing it for the gen
eration of electricity for power, fuel and
lighting. Our lumber industry and our
b eP t-sugar enterprises nre also receiving !
much attention from capital. In short, i
the wave of business has started for Cali- |
fornia. It is no longer looked upon as the j
Florida of the Pacificâ a place Tor invalids |

as i land of great resources and enormous j
business possibilities."
