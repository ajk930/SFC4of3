BLAZING SNOWSHEDS
ILLUMINE THE SIERRAS
Southern Pacific Property Valued at Thousands
of Dollars Ruthlessly Destroyed
by Incendiaries.
/"> ACRAMEXTO, Oct. 4.â A terrific
fire raged in the Sierra 1 . ada
Mountains this morning, and
K_/ when it had spirit its fury a
mile and one-sixth of sheds
â¢werr- but charred and smoking embers
and over a mile of steel rails were bent
and twisted by the tierce heat.
Two passeneer trains, one eastbound
nnd the other west, were stalled, and
t.h*Â» read was practically under block
ade all day. Th<=-re is no question as to
the origin of the fire. 'â¢ was plainly
the work of an incendiary. The Placer
County officials are at work on the case,
aided by th*Â» shrewdest of the Southern
Pacific detectives, and no means will bÂ»?
spared to apprehend the miscreants.
Almost every year the railroad com
pany suffers from fires in the snow-
Fheds. and â â â 'â  are generally of a so
rlous character. There are lons
stretches in the mountains where the
sheds are absolutely needed to protect
the track from avalanches of snow
wl>iÂ«-h, w*re it not for the sheds, would
roll down upon It. The rotary snmv
plnv.s invented as a substitute for the
Hh&ds- do not avail in the* steep passe?
in th* high Sierras, and the ra-'.road
company has been obliged to maintain I
the long system of sheds in the face of
thf fact that it costs an enormous sum
yearly to preserve and rebuild Ih^m.
Naturally, bfir.rr constructed of p:nÂ°
and subjected to thÂ» drying process of
the rainless summers in the high alti
tude of the mountains, the shed 3 he
com* very inflammable and it takes but i
an application of the incendiary's torch
to convert them into a sinuous serpent
of fire.
Profiting by its costly experience, the
railroad company has established ftro
trains at the Summit and Blue Can
yon, r.n which steam is k*pt constantly
and a crew of firemen ready night and
day to respond at a moment's call. For
the fire train every piece of rolling !
stock must turn aside at the nearest
switch^ No train thunders through the
hills at such sp^ed^ and the work of the
crew is as exciting as it Is perilous. To
complete the system of precautionary
measures a lookout station is located
on the crest of Red 1 Mountain, near
Cisco. Here a man and his wife live,
and here every ten minutes of the
twenty-four hours, one or the other,
with field glass in hand, sweep the en
tire r>tretch of snowsheds from â¢ Blue
Canyon to the Summit. Besides these
lookouts fire watchmen traverse the
sheds constantly. A telephone line
runs through the sheds, up to. Red
Mountain and down again to the fire
train. When the lied Mountain senti
nel sees a fire, or is informed of one
through the telephone, he sends a mes
sage to the fire "trains to rush to the
E â  -
Last night at 9 o'clock the Red 1
Mountain sentinel sent in word to rail
road headquarters that the telephone
line had evidently been cut or broken
somewhere in the sheds. The Western
Union Telegraph wires, which are in
closed in a cable running under the roof
of the sheds, about 2 a. m. refused to
work, and it was at once realized that â 
the cable had been cut. â¢ About this
time the Red Mountain lookout saw a I
fire on the shed line near Butte bridge.
The agent at Cisco wired to Sacra
mento that the sheds were on fire. Di
vision Superintendent Wright dis
patched the fire train at Blue Canyon
to the scene. When the fire-fighters ar
rived they discovered the incendiary
character of the blaze. The sheds run
along continuously until they come to
butte near a bridge which is 430 feet
long. There the shed system slops, to

Yet at both ends of the bridge the fires
had been started, and. though a
stretch of Iron 430 feet long intervened.
the sheds on both sides were madly
aflame. A strong south wind was blow
ing at the time, and passengers de
scribe the scene as magnificent. The
flames Illuminated the heavens and
placed the towering pines of the sur
rounding hills in bold relief against the
reddened sky.
Up to a late hour to-night no arrests
have been reported here in connection
v Ith the fire.
A Bhort time ac<> the lookout at Red
Mountain detected some men in the
â¢" - ttlng fire to the pine forests on
the other side of the American River
Although a search was made for
them the men could rot be caught.
The loss of the railroad company by
the present fire will probably reach
I. It will be necessary to rebuild
the sheds before the heavy snows set
in. and a large forc<* of men will at once
-t to work. The track is rapidly
rebuilt and new rails laid, and
trail..- :; be running on schedule
time.

NEW YORK. Oct. 4.â The Mall
and Express says: "All accounts
agree that the thorough test
made yesterday in connection
with the yacht race of th-- Mar
coni system of wireless teleg
raphy resulted in eminent satis
faction. Not only were complete
bulletins sent from the sea by
Signor Marconi and his assist
ants to the highlands of Xave
sink. being transmitted thence to
the city b> wire, but return
messages were received on ship
board containing the leading
news of the day. The average
time of the transmission of
yacht news from the steamer far
out upon the water to the wait
ing crowd in New York is said
to have been sixty seconds. It
was a significant, even startling
demonstration of a new depart
ure in scientific achievement, the
eventual value of which may be
illimitable. As a journal^
of great and lasting merit this
has never been surpassed.
NEW YORK. Oct. 4.â From all
parts of th^ country, east, west,
north and south, queries and
congratulations poured in to
day up<">n Signor Marconi as a
result "f the Bplendid results achieved
on Tuesday in reporting by wireless
telegraphy the first contest between
the Columbia and the Shamrock for
the Herald and The Call.
In San Francisco the * terest in Sig
nor Marconi's work was greater than
| that in the yacht race. From that city
| came a request that the Herald "tele
graph whether Marconi met all expec
tations." Prom Atlanta, Ga., and from
New Orleans. La., ' came similar re
quests for information. To all of these
thrre could be made only one reply.
Signer Marconi had exceeded every
reasonable expectation.
One result of wireless telegraphy
with stations aboard the Grande
j Duchesse and the Ponce is the greatly
increased demand for tickets for these
ships. Excursionists desire to have the
double satisfaction of witnessing the
contest between the two greatest
yachts ever constructed and at the
same time watching the operations of
the latest marvel in the field of prac
tical science. Each of the two ex
cursion boats thus favored will to
morrow carry the limit in the matter
of passenger list.
The work of sending bulletins will
to-morrow be divided between the
Ponce and the Grande Duchesse.
Signor Marconi, as usual, will be on
the Ponce, guiding from the chart
room of that steamship the operations
of the four stations. From the Ponce
he will bulletin the start of the ruc>
and describe the contest until 12:30
o'clock, when the operators on the
Grande Duchesse will take up the work
and follow the challenger and cup de
fender around the first stake boat.
There Signor Marconi will again open
communication from the Ponce, the
work on th>- run home being divided
the same as in the run for the first
mark. A red flag flying from the tall
spar above the mast of the Ponce will
indicate that Signor Marconi is flash
ing bulletins to the shore. If no flag
flies at the masthead of the Ponce th
operators on the Grande Duehesse will
flash bulletins by those mysterious cur
rents which have just been controlled
for the service of man. Bulletins will
be sent from that ship to the receiving
stations at Xavesink Highlands and on
the cable ship Mackay-Bennett.
In addition to four representatives of
the United States Government, who
have been detailed to give a careful
study to the Marconi system, there will
be on the Ponce a lieutenant attached
to the German embassy in Washington
and a Japanese naval officer. These
gentlemen have been detailed by their
governments to profit by the work be
ing done by Signor Marconi. They will
report upon the results accomplished.
The work done Tuesday. Important
as it was, will no doubt be far sur
passed to-morrow.
A i "all representative in the Herald"s
telegraph room forwards Marconi's
bulletins by special overland wire di
rect to The Call's business office. He
la seated between two operators. On
his left the Marconi reports are re
ceived from the Xavesink Highlands
wireless telegraph station and at his
right hand is an operator working the
San Francisco wire.
By "reading copy" over the shoulder
of operator No. 1 and dictating orally
to No. 2, the messages reach The Can's
bulletin board on Market street only
a word or two behind their receipt in
the Herald office, and only one or two
minutes after they are filed by Signor
Marconi on the steamer Ponce, which
follows the racers.

located on Eddy street, between Jones
and Leavenwcrth, shortly before 5
o'clock last evening. The crumbling roof ]
and time-dried timbers crackled as tlie
flame tongue crept through and within
five minutes the building was an inferno, i
Up the tall coiner steeples the flanus
crept, cut away the supports and with j
the grace of divers the weighty sp;r B

belches forth trom the burning church in

ing circle. Out from the rear of the j
church' the flames reached and left a
charred, path across the buildings near,
and across the street in front the new- i
placed paint withered from the heat.
Just how the fire started is a "mystery., |
Although adjoining buildings were some
what damaged there is no doubt
but that it first kindled in the church. ;
Mrs. E. ! Jewel was perhaps tne first to !
see the flames. She occupied a suite of j
rooms in tne Normandie, ;Â£t> Eddy street,
and looking out of the window saw the
flames reaching out from the church to
ward the hotel. She shouted an alarm
through the corridors of the hotel, wnence j
it was taken up and carried down the
street. Ottlcer Harry Hook heard the I
shout and rang in the alarm. A tew min
utes later' Chief Sullivan arrived and or
dered a second and a third alarm turned
in. This brought the engines from outly- |
ing districts, and within fifteen minutes j
alier the names were first seen a Siamese '
nozzle, fed by three, engines, was tnrow
ing a stream into the burning steeples.
The supports were too nearly eaten away, j
however, and slowly the one on the west j
bent over and plunged into the street. j
Firemen, citizens and police skurried to I
places Dl safety, and then the stream was i
turned to the remaining steeple. In a j
minute later it was seen to waver, and :
just as the voices of half , a thousand
people shouted an alarm it seemed that
the confined gases within the .walls ex
ploded beneath this steeple and it went
nurtling into the street.
It was too late for the firemen to flee,
and borne down by the fiery mass five of
them lay bleeding on the pavement. Will
ing hands released nozzle and hose and !
hurried to their rescue. Lee Costello of |
engine 14 was among the first placed on
his feet, and although suffering -from a
severe laceration of the scalp and con
cussion he retained his consciousness and I
assisted by a fireman and Mayor Phelan i
was taken outside the lines, placed in a '
carriage and driven to the. hospital. Ed- 1
ward McGonigle of engine 31 was practi- i
cally unconscious. He was taken by four j
firemen to the Ellis-street Clinic. Dr
Hereford took twelve stitches in a lacera
tion extending almost from ear to ! ear. '

the right hand. As aon as the i
was dressed, however, he refus<
his home, but returned to continue the
battle with the flame?. Two other fire
men were injured by the failing steeples,
but they were quiekiy removed to their
homes, and up to a late hour their r.
had not been given out. All are n
well and it is not thought that a fatality
will result from the injuries received at
lire fire, although the escape of the in
jured fireman from instant death was
miraculous.
After the injured had be^n removed the
work of extinguishing the flames was re
newed with increasing- vigor.
The Hotel Normandie. which caught fire
shortly after flames w^re seen bursting
from the rcof of the church, was occu
pied by Mrs. Alice M. Marshall as a lodg
ing house. There are fifty rooms in the
house, which were all occupied. The mo

guests grabbf-d their valuables and rushevl
to places of safety. Many of the inmates
of the house were out at the time and
their effects sitill remain in the rooms,
broken and spoiled by falling plaster,
and smoke. Mrs. Marshall stated
that the house had been furnished at a
cost of S-JOoO. and that the furniture wra.s
Insured for (8000. The building, whicn is
owned by a Mrs. Botsford, was badly
damaged in the rear and on the east
side.
Police Officer Frank Riley and his wife
were both confined to their room in the
hotel by illness. They had just managed
to crawl from bed when the firemen en
tered and carried them out.
Jacob Immel. the sexton of the church,
was in the edifice when the fire started.
The first information he received that
the- building was on fire was Imparted
to him by a stranger who rushed into tho
church and" yelled to him that the roof
was on fire. It was Immel's opinion that
the fire was caused by sparks from the
Hotel Normandie chimney. He bases his
opinion on the fact that the kitchen <>f
the hotel is on the side of the building
where fire first broke out. Immel was
alone in the church when the fire was dis
covered.
Policemen guarded the adjacent houses
from thieves durintr the fire. In the

SANTA FE WAITS
MORE ROOM AT
FERRY BUILDING
Single Slip Will Not
Be Enough.
The Santa Fe Railroad Company is just
at present giving the Board of Harbor
Commissioners a great deal of uneasiness
and incidentally worrying the Southern
Pacific Company. It has notified the
board that it wants to handle its pas
senger traitlc through the ferry depot, and
expects to be furnished with ample ac
commodations. Some time ago it was
promised one of the slips, and this has
been held in reserve for the company.
Now the Sputa Fe people have reached
the conclusion that a single slip is not
enough. It is Intimated the company has
the idea that the Southern Pacific has
more than lib share of the space, and will
force the Harbor Commissioners to
equalize â¢ ters.
While -he Commissioners were in the
midst of an effort to crack this nut. the
Harbor Police presented a tale of woe to
the effect that they would soon be with-,
out a home, on account of the expiration
of the city's lease to their present
quarters on Sacramento street, and
asked to be provided with a room in the
ferry building. With the Santa Fe and
the Harbor Police both pleading for ac
commodation the Commissioners were
perplexed. A conference was held yes
terday morning between Commissioner
Kllburn. Engineer â  limes, Captain
Dunlevy and Sergeant Mahoncy to see
what could be done in the matter.
Holmes suggested that the Commissioners
erect a building for the police adjoining
the chief wharfinger's office. The police
delegation aid not take kindly to the Idea
for the reason that the sewer from
Chinatown empties under the locality,
and the harbor bluecoat will not stand for
a bad sm.ll The police are to submit a
plan to the Commissioners, and if it is
within reason it will be accepted. In the
meantime the members of thÂ« board are
not sleeping well at nights over the de
mand th.it has been made on them by the
Santa Fe.
The momentous question of preserving
piles occupied the attention of the Harbor
Commissioners yesterday afternoon, and
it took a. great deal of jaw gymnastics,
an executive session ana a tilt between
Chairman Kilburn and Samuel C.
Irving, representing the Parafflne Paint
Company to dispose of the matter to the
satisfaction of the board.
After discussing in executive session
bids for doing the work, the Commission
ers awarded the contract to P. F. Dundor
of the San Francisco Lumber Preserving
Company, which uses the creosote pro
cess. The contract calls for a ten-pound
injection to the foot. The price per lineal
foot Is to be as follows: For 12-foot piles
27 cents. 14-foot 30 cents, 16-foot 35 cents
There was no difficulty over the award
until the board had adjourned and Dun
don had left the room. Then Mr. Irving
turned loose his heavy vocal artillery and
Bent a broadside into the spirit of Dundon.
"I am amazed." said Irving', "that you
gentlemen should award a contract, to
Dundon. who has never been known to
kÂ«ep an agreement with you. Three

every precaution was taken to preserve
at least a semijlance at order. A con>s

and Jasper McDonald, recognizing his
own weakness, resigned the chair to An

The convention listened patiently until the
rles Wet it j Reed was an
nounced. A roar of indignation burst
from hundreds of throats. The place was
emonluta. Hisses, groans, curses
the air in a stormy medley. The
reading was interrupted u>:d the chairman
Bed hinwoif almost into apoplexy In
a vain effort to be heard and control the
angry crowd.
The convention was utterly beyond
hounds. McNab and his coterie had at
t< tnpted to work a cheap imposition and
the delegates that dared assert them
selves would have none of it. Reed, who
is so gem-rally obnoxious to them, hau
been withdrawn from the candidacy for
tho District Attorneyshlp and had been
smuggled into the convention as a nomi
nee for .Supervisor. Inspection showed
that at least three districts had been left
without representation In the board and
the convention was wild with indigna
tion.
The rf-solutiow, pledging the convention
to a ratification of the Chicago platform,
had I . red notwithstanding Lhe
fact that James G. Magiure had been
called Into the controversy and had d<
d sue!) action political heresy. In-
Btead of answering the demand of the
delegates on this point McN'ab had served
Reed up to them as a Supervisor. Out of
the din of angry voices came motions to
defer the nomination of the proposed Su
pervisors until the next meeting. The
motions were useless. They were lost by
an overwhelming vote and the men sub
mitted by the committee of seven as a
Board of Supervisors were nominated.
- This action broke the back of the pro
testants. There was to have be<-:i a bat
tle royal for the nomination for Sheriff,
but it degenerated into a pitiable contest
on the part of J. P. Dockery^ who re
ceived twenty-seven votes against 308

a hundred piles for yon that were to

L'undon, who has the contract to furnish
them. We are waiting for them yet. The
Work on the Howard-street pier has been
delayed In consequence. There is a. pen
alty attached to his contract, and you
have made no attempt to exact it. I think
I that if I held the contract and had act id
; as Dundon you wc.uld have had me jump
! Ing sideways. This creosote process, ac
j cording to the report of your own experts,
has proved a failure, and yon know it."
Mr. Kilburn admitted that he had
vi ry little personal knowledge of pile pre
serving, for the reason thai he had not
I bten a member of the State Board long
anough to learn about such things. He
1 L;id made inquiries, however, and found
that the Southern Pacific Company was

anything that was good enough for that
Institution was .sood enough for him.

fire. No loss of property except by fire
and water has been recorded.
Chief Sullivan was jubilant over the
work of his department. He said that
when hIF men arrived on the seem* the
fire had a good deal of headway, but de

Captain Comstock of the Underwriters'

easi Bide, will lose $2000 or $3000 due to
damage to hi? building by fire and water.
It is ?aid that he let his insurance policy
run out a month ago. He valued his
buildings at JIS.OOO. These flats were oc
cupled by Mrs. Gillinar.d; Alex Dijeau,
the musician, and J. B. Bacon, all of
whom suffered some loss.
A two-.Â«tory dwelling opposite the
church, owned by a Mr. Hblrnes, was bad
ly blistered by the heat. The house ia
occupied' by Mrs. Russell. The house oc
cupied by J. W. Whitney in the rear fac
ing Ellis street also caught fire, but
frompt action prevented much damage,
t is estimated that the total damage
done by yesterday's fire will amount to
about $50,000, partly covered by insur
ance.
As night came the ruins became trans
formed into fantastic silhouettes against
the sky. They were viewed by thousands
df people after the police lines were
broken. The blaze had been subdued, and
nothing but smoking and steaming tim
bers claimed the attention of the firemen.
Overhead some of the spire supports
which had not come down with the first
crash hung menacingly over the street,
endangering the lives of pedestrian* ana
firtmei:. By order of Chief Sullivan the
firemen dragged all dangerous parts of
the burned structure into the interior of
the ruins. The work of totally ex
t Irpi'ishing the fire consumed many
hours and the street was not cleared for
streetcar traffic until a late hour.
STRIKE IN LUMBER YARD.
There was a small strike amonsr the
employes of the Union dumber Company
at Sixth and Channel streets yesterday,
about a dozen tally men and drivers,
<".< lifnatod as clerks, demanding their
pay and walking out because of the re
fusal of their employers to increase their
wages from $2 50 lo S3 per day. Superin
tendent H. M. Oochran says the trouble
does not amount to anything.
"Some of the clerks thought they were
entitlf-d to more pay and demanded an In
crease of 50 cents a day." said Mr. Coch
ran last night. "We declined to accede
to their demands and they quit and were
paid off. None of the men employed In
thÂ»- mill went out. We employ between
fifty and sixty men. and the so-called
strike will have no effect on our business.
The mill is Ptlll running."

the candidate ''Jerome" Deasy. referring
possibly to the gentleman who rr f ereed a

After the spirit of the convention had
been broken nominations did not possess
even the interest of novelty. Samuel H.

having it dispensed with, but Chairman
McDonald would not entertnin the mo-

vited to preside over the deliberations of
the convention-, and a hearty cheer greet

Chairman Magulres first announcement
was- that the report of the committee op

Captain Stensland of the schooner
Arago had a narrow escape for his life
yesterday. He was driving along the
front in a buggy with Johnny Cain when
Harry Anderson took two shots at him.
Anderson is 60 years of age and his aim
was not good, so Stensland escaped. The
men have not beer, friends for years, and
Anderson ha.Â« threatened several times to
shoot the young skipper. When he saw
Stensland driving by yesterday he pulled
out his gun and fired. Later he was ar

A CRISP LITTLE
CAPTAIN GRACES
RIP VAN WINKLE
I LIKE the snappy ones. That is why
I like Hlttie Belle Ladd.
She is a crisp little captain in "Rip

and the pity is that the opera book sends
her home to her chafing dish before the
first act Is over. She leaves the audience
to Bessie Falrbairn, who tries to jerve
animation cold and without sauce; to
Edith Mason, who ta,kes herself with
grand opera seriousness; to little Gladys
Weller. who is the moEt sadly clever baby
in town, and to various other people, who
mistake the politeness of an audience for j
encores.
Tradition and William Wolff as Rip '
come to save the piece. Tradition warms
our hearts for the Irving story and Wil
liam Wolff ke-eps them warm. The south ;
of Market mnmrncf who had come to i
weep grew hopeful now and then as he |
steered gently toward the edge of weep- <
mess. And th<;n, because he is wise in his ;
generation and has never dreamed for
one wild moment that ho. is a new Jeffer

land of laugluor. The mommer was dis

ELLIS MADE SERGEANT.
The Police Commissioners Pension
Five Old Officers.
The Pension Commissioners of the Po
lice Department met last night and re
tired Sergeant Avan of the Harbor sta
tion, Daniel Libbey and Dennis Hayden
of the Southern station and Patrick
Fleming and Charles Hall., also of the
Harbor station. Thomas Dillon, the pride
of the water front, was slated to go, but
aB he convinced the Commissioners that
he was not physically disqualified from
performing his duties he wat not mo
lested. Policeman â¢'Tommy" Ellis was
promoted to the position of sergeant,
caused by the retirement of Sergeant
Avan. He wIU tuke the latter's place at
the Harbor station. For some time past
Ellis, who is considered one of the clev
erest men in the department, has been
doing special duty with Detective Tom
Gibson. He has a brilliant record, and is
regarded fiy one of the bravest men con
nected with the police force. After his
promotion was made known Ellis was
warmly congratulated by Chief Lees and
his fellow officers.
Edward L. Knorp. an ex-member of the
California Regiment, was appointed a
member of the force. He was warmly
indorsed lor tho position by Colonel Du
boce and Rabbi Voorsanger, one of the
members of the relief committee appoint
ed to provide places for the California
boys who fought in the war with Spain.
ROBBED SLEEPING SOLDIERS.
A Thief Invades the Presidio and Is
Fired Upon.
The military authorities have enlisted
the services of the police in apprehend
ing a thief who has entered a number
of tents at the Presidio and stolen va
rious articles belonging to the soldiers.
Evidently dissatisfied with the watches
and small sums of money which he took
from his sleeping victims, he even car
ried off a number of rifles, the property
of the United States army.
Early yesterday morning the thief was
discovered entering a tent and the sentry
ordered him to halt. Unmindful, he took
to his heels. The sentry fired two shots
at him, but failed to bring him down.
Last night a number of police officers
In citizens' clothes were patrolling the
Presidio In the hope of catching the thief.
They are convinced that the culprit Is a
soldier.

! with tremendous cheering by some of the
delegates and the entire lobby. Delegate
] Bdelmann yelled himself hoarse and made
! himself prominent by jumping around the
I convention and yelling and stamping his
I approval. "VVhen the noise had ceased Mc
; Kinne continued and said if it were true
â  no Democratic convention could ask the
1 Democrats of San Francisco to support
i that man. Many in the lobby and gallery
; did not hear the name of the gold Demo
crat and called for his name. McKinne
in dramatic tones replied that it was
Charles Wesley Reed, and the name was
received with 'every sign of disapproba
tion.
William Denman of the Forty-first Dis
trict tried to stop ilcKinne's tirade \<y
rising to a point of order. There were
shouts of "fiit down!" "Shut up." "Close
your face!" and oth^r choice advice, but
Denman stood his ground. When recog
nized by the chair he said that the speak
er's remarks were out of order. But what
else he said was lost in the noise that fol
lowed his opening sentence. In fact, the
chair was not allowed to rule on the ques
tion. McKinne bobbed up again, his gray
whiskers bristling with very excitement.
He told of the indorsement of the Chicago
convention by the committee on platform,
of which he was a member, and therefore
asked that Reed's name be effaced from
the list.
Attorney Harrison tried to quell Mc-
Kinne, as did also the chair, but
with little success, as the gallery
was too boisterous. McKinne concluded
tÂ»y asking for another meeting so that
the report could be considered. Tre
CITY HOSPITAL
AFFAIRS IN A
BAD MUDDLE
Food and Supplies
Are Cut Off.
The affairs of the City and County Hos
pital are again in a muddle, and neither
the Mayor, the Supervisors nor the Board
of Health can suggest a way out of the
Berlous difficulty which has now presented
Itself. Unless something is done and done
quickly the inmates of the hospital must
go without adequate food and the bare
necessities of life. The authorities under
stand the condition of affairs and simply
shrug their shoulders. They claim that
they can do nothing and must let the
matter take its course.
It is the old fight .of the contractors
against the city. The merchants that
furnish supplies to the hospital have not
been paid, and they have notified Mayor
Phelan and the Board of Supervisors that
no more supplies will be furnished until
the bills are paid. As there is no money
with which to pay the bills and no pros
pect of obtaining any, the situation pre
sented is a serious one.
The hospital is without coal, fresh
meats and many very necessary drugs.
These must be obtained or the charges of
the city must suffer. Two explanations
are given for the failure of the city to pay
the bills. On the one hand it Is claimed
that the dollar limit of taxation Is far
inadequate for the proper administration
of the hospital and it is as easy to con
duct it upon the present appropriation as
it is to make one dollar do the service of
two. On tho other hand, it Ls asserted
the appropriation for the hospital under
the dollar limit is sufficient and that gross
extravagance is responsible for the snort
ago and the present predicament.
When the Supervisors were making pro
visional appropriations for the various
city and county departments under a ten
tative levy which has been superseded by
the absolute one, the sum of $113,000 was
appropriated provisionally for the main
tenance of the City and County Hospital
For two months the hospital has been run

mendous howls of approhption greeted
the speaker when he finished. Then a
delegate of the Twenty-ninth raised his
viÂ»i<i> above the timiK'il to ask why a
representative of the Twenty-ninth dis
trict was not on the list in place of a
gold Democrat. Assemblyman William
\V. "White wanted the report to receive
conscientious deliberation before It was
adopted, and Martin Callahan said some
thing about seven men dictating to the
convention as to what men should spend
the millions paid by the citizens in tuxes
His reception was not a cordial one. ana
h e took his seat with a very red face.
Louis de Forrest Bartk-tt defended the
work of the committee and explained why
some of the districts did not receive
representation. The previous question be
ing called for. a vote was taken which
resulted In 242 noes to 93 ayes, and the
motion to defer was lost. A motion t â 
adopt the report of the committee was
carried, and then the chair instructed
Secretary Hiikey to cast the vote of the
convention for the eighteen candidates.
The next order of business was the
nomination of a Treasurer, and Sydney
Van Wyck placed Samuel H. Brooks in
nomination. In a grandiloquent, manner
he displayed ten silver dollars and said
it was the voice of the Democracy
and an uncharitable gallery god yelled
"Give it to Reed." Nothing daunted by
the laugh which followed the sally, the
speaker r.ald something about liberty and
I the eagle screaming for his candidate. He
i then told <>t his meeting John B. Mhoon,
| and of the latter giving him views on Mr.
I Brooks which were greeted shamefully
by the rude gallery. He even essayed a
negro story to strengthen his candidate's
right to the position, but this was re
ceived with derisive laughter. He told of
the ease with which Mr. Brooks was
elected Treasurer in San Joaquin County
and how he "walked" into the Con
troller's office. He thought Mr. Brooks
would add strength to the ticket and
would, if elected, make a sterling officer.
Alex T. Vogelsang seconded the nomina
tion, and no other candidate having put
in an appearance, Mr. Brooks was chosen
to represent the Democratic party at the
next election.
The next business was the selection of
a candidate for Auditor. Secretary
Hickey made an excellent speech in
nominating Joseph M. Cummings for the
office. He told of his high standing in
the community; of his connection with
the Mechanics' Institute. The nomina
tions beiiis^ declared closed, Mr. Cum
mir.gs was unanimously chosen by the
convention.
Nominations for Sheriff were next in or
der and P. H. McCarthy named Jeremiah
Deasy for the office. He extolled Mr.
Deasy's virtues and the mere mention of
the latter's name aroused hearty ap
plause. Delegate Cosgrave followed by
placing Edward Rock's name before the
convention, and then T. J. Fitzsimmons.
with hair awry and determination writ
ten in every line of his face, took the
platform and nominated James P. Dock
ery for the office. His speech created no
end of merriment and was constantly in
terrupted by both delegates and lobby,
who anxiously inquired whether he was
nominating "Dewey or Dreyfus." He was
also advised to stop "kidding himself";
upon the basis of such an appropriation,
the expenditures being made in accord
ance with the one-twelfth act. When the
actual legal levy was made the City and
County Hospital was allowed only $90,000,
exclusive of a fund for repairs? The ex
cess of expenditures in July and August
must now be made up by restrictions on
the present months and the months to
come of the fiscal year. While the hos
pital authorities were spending over $9000
\ mol^ h they did not rea-lize that after
the official levy was made they would
have only $7500 a month, and out of this
sum large deficiencies would have to be
paid.
This Is the causo of the deficiency and
the reason why the merchants have not
been paid. The Mayor cries extravag
ance and the Supervisors reply that the
dollar limit Is inadequate to the proper
administration of public municipal affairs
Dr. Perrnult is primarily concerned for
the welfare of the inmates of the hos
pital and insists that whatever the solu
tion of the difficulty may be, these people
cannot be permitted to starve or be de
prived of the drugs that they need. The
contractors and merchants have submit
ted their complaint to Mayor Phelan and
he has referred the matter to the Hospital
( ommittee of the Board of Supervisors
This committee will wrestle with the
problem and meanwhile the inmates of
the City and County Hospital must go
without drugs and fresh meats and pray
for continuous hot weather.
MORPHINE A SOLACE
FOR ALL HER ILLS
May McCaffrey, a young woman 22 years
of age, died at the Receiving Hospital
last night from the effects of morphine
poison taken yesterday afternoon with
suicidal intent. Drs. Dray and Brown
worked on the unfortunate woman, but
the poison had heen taken four hours
previous to the time she was brought to
the hospital and they were unsuccessful
According to "the story told by James
Brophy, who claims to be the girl's hus
bana, the couple retired to their room at
2t'7 Post street at 5 o'clock yesterday
morning somewhat under the influence of
liquor. His companion was in good hu
mor and between 3 and 4 o'clock in the
afternoon she .got up and drank a cup of
water. Brophy thinks that it was then
she took the morphine, though he had not
seen it in her possession. She immedi
ately went to sleep without a word and
lie did likewise. About 5 o'clock he was
awakened by a knock on the door and
he got up to admit Annie McCaffrey, a
sister of the dead girl. Annie went over
to greet her sister and tried to wake her
up, but without success. She shook her
a couple of times and then noticed that
her lips were purple. Becoming alarmed
Annie summoned Dr. Cook, who lives in
the neighborhood, and he treated the dy
ing woman after a fashion.
to "get off the earth." and other bits of
advice. In part he said:
"I want to place before you the name
of a man whose reputation is not con
fined to the boundaries of San Francisco,
but whose sterling honesty while in or
fice lias reached the eontlnes of the I niteu
States and has even spread to Europe
(Jim Xeal Interrupted the speaker to asK
if it was Dewey.) "But. seriously, gen
tlemen. I mean what 1 said. James V.
Dockery w in this reputation by raiding
the milkmen on the San Bruno road at
midnight, and his war on impure milk
has made him known throughout the
country. The finger of scorn can never
be pointed with suspicion against Mr.
Dockery. , .
"I understand there is no slate in this
convention. (Tremendous cheering and
cries of 'wow.') The reason 1 believe It,
gentlemen, is that Gavin McNab told me
himself that his hands were otf the ngnt
for the nomination for Sheriff and Mr.
1' ickery went to .Mr. Phelan. who told him
that he could not see how he (Mr. Dock
ery) could be defeated for any office he
might aspire to. (Applause and laughter.)
There Is a man on the Republican ticket
(Lackmann) who we all know is honest
and upright and a bard man to beat. If
we are to win that office we have to put
a man on the ticket who will win, and
I suggest the name of James P. Dockery
as the man to do it."
The voting then commenced, and as Mr.
Rock did not secure a Vote when the first
five delegations were polled. Mr. Cosgravo
withdrew his name and appealed for the
return of his $10. The secretary took the
advice of a man in the gallery who yelled
"Don't give up the ten." The chairman
announced the vote as follows: Deasy
30S and Docki ry L 7. The former was then
made the choice of the convention by ac
clamation. An adjournment was then
taken until to-morrow night.

HORACE DAVIS
TO LEAD THE
REPUBLICANS
He Will Accept the
Nomination.
The Republican Convention to-night
will doubtless nominate Horace Davis for
Mayor, and his friends assert that he will
accept the nomination. The people of San
Francisco well know that Mr. Davis' rec
ord, as a man and a merchant is without
a blemish; hence they were astonished
and disgusted to hear that he was vicious
lv assailed yesterday by a subsidized
evening Journal: The personal and politi
cal friends of Mayor Phelan were first to
condemn the assault, asserting that the
Mayor would not count-enance or approve
such tactics as political .are.
Republicans hold that the purpose of
the assault was to drive Mr. Davis from
the Held and compel the convention to
select another nominee. The .aught
is therefore regarded as a tribute to the
strength and popularity of the proposed
nominee. ...
Horace Davis is an honorable candidate
Tiie record of his public and private lifo
can be spread before the world. He is not
a weak or timid man. prone to take alarm
at newspaper attack.
in gem-ral convention last night â¢ he
ipoke of the evening paper's assault with
out manifesting the least sign of trcpl- i
ditipn or resentment. He recognized the
general feeling that business men of high j
character often refuse to accept public
service in order to secure immunity from
the. raids of the subsidized -press. If his ;
purpose to accept the Republican nomi
nation for Mayor was not tixed before th<
evening paper's tirade was published it
v as â  iiied shortly after ihtÂ» publication.
He cannot be intimidated.
The key note of the campaign of the
opposition was sounded in the cry against
Horace Davis. The plan Is to assail men <
who employ labor, invest money and dis
play enterprise in promoting the prosper
ity and advancement of the city.
Irving M. and Henry T. Scott are \
whacked because the opposition paper
euspects that one or the other may accept !
leadersnip of the publicans in the event
of. Mr. Davis' declination. K. W. Dohr- ;
inann would be roasted alive if he had
not positively declined to accept a place
Ion the Republican ticket.
If Horace Davis were regarded as a
weak or vulnerable man the attacks
would be del erred until his nomination. |
The attack beforehand is manifestly made
to influence delegates against him and
prevent his selection as ... leader of Re
publican.- in a campaign for good govern
ment and municipal prosperity.
The Democrats have nominated James
D. Phelan for Mayor and he is respected
as a representative citizen. The Republi
cans have shed a purpose to nominate
Horace Davis. Every one regards Mr.
Davis as a representative citizen of high
character. The hope has been fre
quently expressed that each party would
put forward a respected citizen as its
loader and that the campaign would be
fought out on party lines. It was hoped
that the campaign would be free from
acrimonious assault and personal vilifi
cation. The mud-slinging propensity of
the subsidized evening Journal, therefore,
Mirprised. Republicans and Democrats
' alike.
The primary election law was founded
on the principle of party responsibility.
Leaders of each party advocated the en
actment of the law. The delegates to the
various municipal conventions were
chosen under party designations. The
nominations have been made on party
lines and party lines cannot be obliterated
tit the polls. The Democratic municipal
ticket will receive the support, of the
Democratic press and the Republican
ticket will be sustained by the Republican
press. The party that wins will gain
vantage ground in California for the
great contest in 1900, but that gain will
not release it from strict accountability
for the administration of municipal
affairs. â¢

aspects followed its recommendation and
rsed sixteen men for the office of Su
to be presented to the conven
tion this evening. This loaves two nomi
nations open, the caucus taking no action
probably open for business on the 16th

THE SAN FBAK CISCO CALL, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 5, 1899.
upon them with the understanding that
Horace Davis, the prospective nominee for
Mayor, should have opportunity to-day to
express his preferences, presumably from
the nine remaining upon the committee's
list.
The session was a protracted one, and.
not one moment was dull. Many men
were of different minds and the conse
quence was heated discussion and acri
monious debate, as if In refutation of the
Ruef charge of "slate." An attempt was
made to open up the fight on Police Judge
indorsements In the interest of Thomas
P. Graham, and to rescind the motion by
which A. D. McLean was indorsed for
Coroner, on the ground that he had not
been a resident of the State for five years
last past, but both attempts were de
feated.
The caucus testified also the Implicit
confidence it had In its chairman by em
| powering him to select and to name In
convention to-night a county committee
i of ninety, four from each district, after
I considering the wishes of each delegation,
and eighteen at large.
It was an hour after the time set for the
, caucus before Chairman Kellogg called It
i to order.
Charles J. King of the Thirty-ninth EMs
trlct awakened enthusiasm by offering
three cheers for the chairman, which were
; given with a will.
Delegate Reed of the Thirty-ninth As
sembly District asked the privilege of ad
| dressing the caucus before tho transaction
of any business.
"In view of the disgraceful conduct of
some of the delegates on the floor of the
i convention last night," he said, "I move
, that it be ordered that none but delegates
be allowed on the floor and that the
spectators be confined to the gallery: and
that a sergeant and squad of police be
requested to aid the sergeant-at-arma to
keep order outside." i
CONSUMPTION IS
EPIDEMIC AMONG
THE ESQUIMAUX
Many Deaths Reported
at Point Barrow.
Pie Ftpam whaler Beluga is back in
; with one of the largest catches ever
le in the Arctic. During her absence
thirty months the crew took sixty
three whales; so every man aboard has
a big payday coming- to him. Very few
days passed while the season lasted that
a whale was not taken, and during one
day in August four of the leviathans were
caught. That was not a bad day's work
when the fact that each whale is valued
at over 16000 is taken Into consideration.
Nearly the entire catch was made off
Baiiey Island and Cape Bathurst.
There were two fatalities on the Be
luga during the cruise. On August 26.
LS9B, several whales were sighted and all
the boats were lowered. The mate's boat
made fast to a whale and the mammal
at once sounded. The rope was running
out of the tub so fast that water had to
be poured on the wood to keep it from
catching fire. Unfortunately Just at that
1 moment Oscar Huschenbett stumbled and
stepped into the coil of flying rope. He
! was carried overboard and down out of
i sight in an instant. The rope was at
I once out, but Huschenbett never came to
the surface again.
On September 10, 1598, an Indian was
i killed. He formed one of a boat's crew
i that was fast to a whale. After a long
chase the animal gave up and the boat
approached bo that the lance could finish
the job. Just as the boatheader was
ready to strike the whale its big tail went
up and the next instant the boat was in
â  kindling wood. The Indian was killed out
right, but the rest of the boat's crew were
i saved by the other boats.
! Captain Bodflsh reports that some kind
! of a disease like rapid consumption is
j epidemic among the Indians. At Point
! Barrow, between August 14 and Sep
tember 7 there were nineteen deaths and
at Cape Bathurst three natives died dur
ing the few hours the Beluga was anchor
ed there. The Indians are scared so badly
that, as soon as one of them is taken sick
he. immediately begins making prepara
tions for death. "If the death rate keeps
up at Point Barrow," said Captain Bod
lish yesterday, "there will be no Indians
I left when the whalers get there next
1 spring."
The stories about the whalers Jean
nette, Karluk and Bowhead being chased
by theÂ» Bear are made out of whole cloth.
"The Bear was in the Arctic and I sup
i pose the ofilcers were keeping a bright
! outlook for any one who would attempt to
Bell whisky to the natives," said Captain
Bodflsh. "When the Bear was at Point
Barrow the Jeannette, Karluk and Bow
head were at Herschel Island and when
the three whalers reached Point Barrow
â  the revenue cutter was at St. Michael.
' That was the nearest to each other they
were while I was up there, so the stories
of stern chases and bow chasers sending
leaden messengers after the fleeing whal
ers are all fairy tales."
Tiki and Kaunana. the two Esquimaux
â¢ who came out with Mate Tllton of the
Belvedere with the news of the frozen
whalers two years ago, are back at Point
Barrow. They are considered two of the
â  most artistic liars in the whole of the
frozen north. Their tales of the wonders
they saw in San Francisco are too much
i for the simple natives who have never
: been away from home and never saw a
tall building in their lives.
Captain Bodflsh reports that Captain
James McKenna, in the Fearless, was
ninety miles to the westward of Herschel
Island on August 27 and that Captain
Cogan, in Alaska, left Cape Smyth on
August 23 to go to the westward. Both
vessels were clean. The catch of the
rest of the fleet was given in yesterday
i morning's Call.
PAYMASTERS VISIT
THE MINNESOTA MEN
ALL PAID OFF AND READY TO
LEAVE FOR HOME.
â¢
Camps at the Presidio Being Rapidly
Emptied of Their Occupants.
Three Regiments Away
To-Day.
The aftermath of muster out came to
the Minnesota men yesterday in the shape
of several heavily laden paymasters who
went away lighter than they came. Every
man in the regiment drew down over $125,
so a goodly sum changed hands before
the thousand men were all paid off. The
men seamed to hive forgotten the fact
that payday was a day late, and they
showed all the enthusiasm the occasion
â warranted. Some of the enthusiasm ex
pended itself in the hazing of one Qf the
officers who had been rather more than
strict, but outside of that the pranks of
the men were directed toward each other.
The regiment will start East this morn
ing. The men will assemble at the ferry
in time to catch the 11 o'clock boat for
Oakland, and within an hour they will be
on their way home. The command will
arrive in time to take part in the parade
in honor of the visit of President McKin
ley to Minneapolis. Then it will be dis
banded.
To-day will be the turn of the men from
South Dakota. They will be mustered out
and paid off. and to-morrow they, too,
will start East.
The departure of the South Dakota reg
iment will leave the camp on the north
Bide of the car track deserted, and the
Montana regiment will be the only body
of outgoing volunteers at the Presidio.
The camp of Manila bound volunteers will
also be deserted, for the Twenty-eighth
and Twenty-ninth regiments will leave to
day on the transports Zealandia, City of
Para and Valencia. The coming of the
Washington regiment from Manila will
bring more troops in by the end of this
week, for the Washington men are on the
Pennsylvania and the Pennsylvania is due
any time. There will be no more troops
coming in from the East for some time
yet, for the going of the Tweoty-eighth
and the Twenty-ninth regiments will fin

call for ten. The Thirty-first Regiment

proceeded with its business.

cap at Morris Park.
NEW YORK, Oct. 4.â The Autumn
hurdle handicap and the Hurricane
selling stakes were the features at Mor
ris Park to-day. The first was ruined by
scratches, only three accepting, and

cane King Bramble was a lukewarm
favorite, Coburg and Fleuron being equal

the dip. Fleuron, who had been close,
went to the front, but her leadership was
short, as Coburg came with a rush on the
outside and won driving by half a length,

place. In the second race Peace fell, but
her jockey escaped injury- Peace is

the Insinuation that the committee had
done business in the absence of a quorum.
Captain Roberts, who had been named as
a candidate for Supervisor by Delegate
Boyne, withdrew his name. The substi
tute was put to the house and lost by a
decisive vote. The amendments adding
I the names of James E. Field and J. P.
j Le Count were defeated and ihe original
motion, adopting the report of the com
mittee and naming the first sixteen on
the list as the caucus choice for Super
visors, was carried.
Delegate Tauszky's motion that the
thanks of the delegates be extended to
the committee on Supervisors for its
labors was carried with cheers.
Delegate Burns of the Thirty-first Dls
; trict moved that the caucus rescind the
action by which it had indorsed Dr. Mc-
Lean for Coroner, explaining that the
candidate was in Kentucky In 1895. Later
Dr. McLean explained that at that time
he was a resident of San Francisco, in
Kentucky perfecting his education. The
motion was laid on the table. A similar
motion from Delegate Haynes to re
open the question of the indorsement of
j Police Judges in the interest of Graham
i was lost, after a spirited passage, in
I which Delegate Bradford voiced his de
| sire that' the caucus rescind Its action
I indorsing Mr. Haynes' candidate for Tax
Collector.
When the Graham incident had been
closed the matter of appointing a county
committee was brought up. After con
siderable discussion it was decided to
allow the chairman to appoint the entire
committee after consultation with the
chairmen of the delegations.
To-night's convention will nominate a
candidate for Superior Judge for the un

named to find a candidate.
The nominating convention will com

DR. KILMER'S SWAMP ROOT.
KIDNEY TROUBLE.
The Most Prevalent, Dangerous and
Deceptive Disease.
Thousands Have It and Don't Enow It.
Pains and aches come from excess of
uric acid in the blood, due to neglected
kidney trouble. Kidney trouble causes
quick or unsteady heart beats, and
makes one feel as though they had
heart trouble, because the heart Is
overworking to pump the thick, kid-
ney-poisoned blood through the veins
and arteries.
Soreness or uncomfortable feeling In
the back indicates kidney trouble of no
small importance.
The passing of scanty or profuse
quantities of urine ia a warning of kid-
ney trouble. If you want to feel well
you can make no mistake by first doc-
toring your kidneys.
The famous new discovery, I>r. Kil-
mer's Swamp-Root, is the true specific
for kidney. bladd*er and urinary
troubles. It has cured thousands of
apparently hopeless cases after all
other efforts have failed.
Sold on its merits by nil druggists in
fifty-cent and one dollar sizes. A sam-
ple bottle sent free by mail to any ad-
dress. Also a book telling all about
Swamp-Root and its wonderful cures.
When writing, address Dr. Kilmer &
Co., Binghamton. N. V., and mention
that you read this generous offer in
the San Francisco Daily Call.

THE PIKERS
IN CLOVER
AT OAKLAND
Stromo In First at Odds of
50 to J. â Two Choices
First.
Stromo, the Burns & Waterhouse cast
off, cut a wide swath at Oakland yester
day. He was. a starter in the second
event, over one mile, and a sixteenth, and
so lightly were his chances thought of
that some of the books laid as good as
50 to 1 about the gelding. With little
Fauntleroy on his back, he took the lead
from the start and was never caught,
winning by half a length from Donator.
Dare 11, the top-heavy favorite should
have won, but Walsh misjudged the pace
so badly, waiting for. the. winner to come
back, that he' barely took the show from
Kingmaster. ' â  â â¢
The Stromboli., horse was not the only
rank outsider to wear brackets, for, in
the closing event. New' Moon, a 12 to 1
shot, disposed of the warm favorite
Hohenzollorn. My Gypsy and Panamint
proved the only successful favorites.
The six maiden two-year-olds in the
first dash were not an inviting lot, and
a fair price was obtainable against any
of the starters. My Gypsy looked about
the best, m:d it turned out a Cakewalk
for her. Champion Rose finished well,
downing Follgno for the place.
Nine bad actors caused a half hour de
lay at- the post in the six furlong seOing
handicap. Lavntor, his -first time out.
carried the bulk of the money bet, but
showed none of bis old-time speed, run
ning- third. In a go-as-you-please finish
in the last furlong, Mounde on Magnus
left the bunch.; beating Charles Le Bel
three lengths at the wire.
Fanamint was "Hawkins* horse" yes
terday, and in the six furlong sprint fol
lowing, after Being badly pocketed on the
back stretch, Thorpe threaded his way
out, winning cleverly from Jerid. The
latter made all the running, showing
much improvement over his Chicago
form. Mike Rice was strongly backed
second choice, but was led out for the
third place by Meadow Lark.
11. Stuart astride New Moon furnished
the surprise in tho concluding mile selling
run. Away in the lead, the mare failed to
back up noticeably, and though inclined
to run out the last part, lasted long
enough to get the verdict from Hohen
zollern by a neck. Lodestar ran a bang
up third.

topped goal posts. Driscoll and Carolan
then struggled for possession of the ball
and finally secured it from their op
ponents. Carolan soon had it all to him
self and with a clear field in front of him
he used it until he finally drove the
white sphere through tho first goal for
his team. This was after two minutes'
play. At the end of the next two min
utes he had scored again. Before the
period closed "Tom" Driscoll drove tno
ball over one hundred yards with one
stroke. This was pronounced one of the
longest drives ever seen on a California
polo field.
The score at the end of the first period
was announced as whites 3, reels 1. The
Unofficial score showed only two for the
whites. Just before the end of the period
Hobart, Martin and Carolan dashed across
the field at a mad gallop in pursuit of the
ball. The Spectators cheered the riderÂ«
and their ponies for the great effort they
made.
In the second period Baldwin again
scored the first goal, this time after three
and a half minutes of play. Two minutes
later he tied the score, making it three
all. Shortly after this he secured the ball
by at least 10 per cent. That is one of the
reasons why the fight between both teams
will bo at its hottest. Saturday and Sun
day.
Oakland has won fifteen out of the
nineteen games played since the reorgan
ization of the team and Cal Kwing is most
earnest in his desire to advance the Dudes
from fourth to at least third place. The
three defeats which were forced down the
throat of the I-obsters by the "Wasps was
effective in two ways, advancing the
locals and forcing the beach men to a
level within reach of the Dudes.
The percentage ranking of the teams is
as follows:
A change has been made in the selection
of locality for the playing of the games.
Sacramento will meet San Francisco on
Saturday afternoon, Sunday morning and
afternoon at Recreation grounds. This
again and with all the players behind him
in mad pursuit ho scored again for the
reds before any one could head him off.
When the next ball was put in play by
I'mpire Harry Simpkins. Hobart secured
it and carried it part way across the field.
He had a neck and neck race with Bald
win, who secured the ball, lost it and se
cured it again in time to score hie fifth
goal for his team and to show that he was
It.
He was not through yet, as with a great
backhanded stroke he scored another goal
while pallnpinp. Drlscoll broke the spell
for the whites, lifting the bail in a
straight line for the goal and driving it
through, despite Tobin's efforts to keep
it out.
The score was 7 to 4 In favor nf the
reds at the commencement of the fourth
period. Hobart and Driscoll played mag
nificently and soon had the score 7 to 5,
then 7 to 6. and lust at the last instant of
play made it 7 all. Driscoll hit the ball
which caromed on Hobart's pony and
went between the posts. In playing off
the tie the whites maintained their speed
and secured the deciding goal.
Harry Simpkins was umpire and Buck
ley Johnson referee and timekeeper.

iCUP RACERS ARE READY
TO RESUME THE FRAY
Indications That the Columbia and

Winds for To=Day's Contest.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW Yi'HK, Oct. 5â 4:30 a. m.â The predictions for to-day, while not

"the boat that caused all the
trouble," to quote Sir Thomas. He
said he had a splendid sail around the
bay for about two hours and that from
the speed the old boat made in the stiff
southwest lire.-/.*' he did not wonder
that she had "lifted" the cup on the
other side nearly fifty years ago.
Sir Thomas did not care to make any
statement about to-morrows race ex
cept that the Shamrock would carry
tly the same sails as she did in
yesterday's contest, and that her crew
would do their best to cross the finish
line first The English challenger is in
the best of condition for the coining
race. Nut a piece of wire in her rigging
nor an Inch â¢â !' canvas was found to
be damaged in the least degree when
her crew looked her over this morning.
; The members of the crew are quite as
confident as the Shamrock's owner that
1 she will prove a winner and some of
them are ready to lay a few guineas
it they get th~ chance.
Sir Thomas received hundreds of
egrams to-day from ali parts of the
world congratulating him on the splen
did showing his boat made in light
air against the defender.
"Some of the cables," said Sir
Thomas, "are from people I do not
know personally, but that only goe?
t" show what a great interest is being
taken in these races. One of them read
thus: 'Tommy, don't make room for
your uncle.' "
In speaking about the manner in
which the course was kept clear Sir
Thomas said: "I can't get over the
great organization that has been here
to keep the course clear. Yesterday's
! course was the clearest we ever had,
or I ever saw in England, and only
proves what I said before I came to
America, that in all previous races the
best boat has always won. I may as
Bay now that the Shamrock is the
fastest boat ever built in <Jreat Britain,
and the workmanship was the best that
money could buy. 1 can't tell what
her cost was. but it is probably more
than you have any idea of. She cost
as mu<h as six Valkyries. The esti
mate? already given are away below
the mark."
Chevalier de Martino. the marine ar
tist, who has been commissioned by
Sir Thomas to paint a series of pictures
: .>f the races, was oi tarty that
enjoyed a Bail, on the America. He
said he was delighted with the old
champion and admired boats built of
: more than any others. The
j Chevalier has not yet commenced any
of liis pictures, but is making rough
sketches, which, with the aid of snap
shots, will give him material for his
big painting, which will not be com
menced until his return to IÂ»ndon.
Among Sir Thomas' guests to-morrow
on the Erin will be Rear Admiral
Philip. United States navy, command
ant of the Brooklyn navy yard; Mr.
and Mrs. Thomas A. Bdison, W. Bourke
Cockran, Richard Croker, Rear Ad
miral Lord Charles Beresford and Lady
Beresford, Sir Arnold Morley, Sir Henry
Burdette, Charles Russell, and the Lord
Chief Baron of Trf-land Baron Pollas.
Rear Admiral Sampson would have
been aboard, but as he goes to Hamp
ton Roads to-morrow It will be impos
sible.
<m either Saturday or next Tuesday
Admiral Dewey will be one of Sir
Thomas' guests on the Erin.
Lord MintÂ«Â«, Governor General of
Canada, will witness Saturday's race
from the Erin and Rear Admiral Schley
has accepted an invitation to be on
board the same day. Oeorge Westing
house, thf- inventor, will also be a
guest on Saturday.
When asked about the condition of
Designer Fife Sir Thomas said: "Dr.
Reid Maekey, my doctor, is with him
and I understand he Is not much bet
ter. I am very- sorry, for I miss him
very much. His illness at this time is
Very unfortunate."
Borne uncertainty has prevailed as to
j the course which will be sailed to-mor
row by the Columbia and the Sham
! rock. The matter was settled, how
ever, this afternoon at a meeting of the
i regatta committee, which was held at
the New York Yacht club houF*>. After
i the meeting C. S. Nicholson Kane an
nounced that the next race would he as
on Tuesday â fifteen miles to windward
or inward and a beat back.
It seems that the agreement bptween
' Sir Thomas Lipton and the Columbia's
owner relates that where It is Impos
sible to finish a contest within the time
I limit, the same class of race must be
continued until a decision Is reached.
Consequently, before the two boats can
meet on the three-leg beat it will be
necessary to settle the capabilities of
the two champions on the straight
away run of fifteen knots. In conse
: quence of the quickly waning daylight
i at this time of the year, the regatta
:nittee to-day determined that the
Btart would be made at 10:45 a. m.. a
difference of fifteen minutes from the
time previously fixed for the yachts
going over the lino.
The ending of Tuaeday's encounter
has tended materially to whet the in
terest of the yachting enthusiasm In

Captain BQb Evans terms it, or wrench -
: ed up and carted away to the country
i which for so many years has been un
j successfully fighting for it.
The Columbia's performance on Tues
day is generally regarded as proving
her the better boat of the two. The
j concensus of opinion Is that, given
Â» quni condiltons, that is when there are
! no fluky winds, and no elements of at
mospheric luck to be calculated, the
American representative can both out
foot and outpoint the foreigner. It was
i contended that while the Fife creation
held her own in the erratic and paltry
breexea which marked the first race, an
other tale will be told when the Colum-
I bia has a chance to exhibit her partlcu
i lar qualities of sailing. It i tf asserted
! also that there is nothing tangible in
I the contention that the Emerald sloop
! will prove stronger In a breeze than the
! defender.
It was observable that the Shamrock
kicked up much more fuss in the
choppy sea than did the Columbia, and
it is inferred that when she does meet
B blow she will thrash and make much
worse weather of it than her eompeti
'â  tor. However, when all is said and i
i done, this decanting upon the superior
â  ity of one boat over another is only so
; much speculation. Generally speaking.

I conditions under which it was sailed,

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 5, 1899.
MINING COMPANY'S
COIN COUNTERFEITED
Shrewd "Shovers of the Queer" Who Can
not Be Prosecuted by the United
States Court,
ft KESWICK, Oct. 4.â Hundreds of dollars" worth of aluminum checks
0 issued by the Mountain Copper Company of this place have passed
J^ current here for the past few months as so much money. While they
i* were only "good for merchandise at the Mountain Copper Company's
Â£j stores" they were easily sold for good United States money at a trifling
g discount. They had become such staple currency locally that it was
5^ not unusual to see poker games In which the only valuable commodity
was this "calcine money," as it was nicknamed. A thousand dollars or
{3 more was in circulation in Keswick and Iron Mountain.
fc Â» To-day it was discovered that counterfeit aluminum checks were in
O general circulation. The counterfeit Is a good one, and nearly every
*S business man in town on examining his till finds that he has been de-
Si frauded of sums varying from $1 up to $50. Of course there is no ap
-0 peal to the United States Government.
â¢S The Sheriff is investigating the matter, hoping to ferret out the
Â§â¢ parties guilty of perpetrating the fraud upon the community. The com-
O> pany has decided to recall all the genuine checks, redeeming them and
J? stopping their â  issue. This will be a great relief to business men of the
â*â¢ town, who have lost considerable trade because of the aluminum checks,
*> that were redeemable only at the company's store.

of what either yacht is capable of really
doing than if the contest had never
been sailed. That is the opinion of im
partial and calm-minded yachtsmen
who saw and studied the first trial be
tween the Shamrock and Columbia.
One thing is universally agreed to
among yachtsmen, and that is that Ho
garth proved himself a better seaman
thart Karr. It was generally conceded
that the favoring flukes which at
tended the Shamrock were due not so
much to Llpton's luck as to Hogarth's
better judgment.
COLUMBIA AGAIN THE
FAVORITE IN BETTING
NEW YORK, Oct. 4.â When the Colum
bia enters upon the race to-morrow to
defend the America's cup she promises to
be as strong a favorite in the betting as
she was prior to Tuesday's nuke. Bettors
to-day had entirely recovered from the
feeling of apprehension they nau after
Tuesday's contest. Although all wagers
mrde early In the day were at even
munev soon after QOOn th" situation
changed and odds of 10 to 9. lo to 8 and in ,
some instances 10 to t> were offered on the
Columbia. Several bets of $100 to $â â Â» on
the Columbia were made in Vk all street,
and one or two bets were laid at $100 to
$60 that the defending yacht would win
the series. A broker made two bets or
$50 to $20 that the Shamrock would not
win the race.
The only bets of any considerable
amount reported during the day or even-
Ing were made at the Hoffman House.
One bet of $500 to $400 on the Columbia j
and another of $650 to $500 on her were ,
posted. Smaller bets at odds of 10 to 9
also were made.
Sportsmen attribute the shift back from
even money to the great scarcity of i
money to hack the Shamrock. Thousands !
of dollars to be placed on the Columbia
been lying In the safes of several!
Broadwaj resorts Blnce last Saturday,}
and only a pmall part of this has been â 
wagered. Two bets of $50 even wf>re made [
nighi in the Imperial Hotel, and |
whenever any money on the Shamrock ;
hap been found it has been promptly cov
ered.
It was> oxppcted that betting on to-mor
row's race and on the series would bÂ«
lively to-day owing to the outcome of the
first contest. The adherents of the Colum
bia Stood ready to make it ko, and when
they could find no money on the Sham
rock began to offer odds, but up to to
nl^t'.t only a small amount of money has
been placed.

â¦ â 
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, Oct. 4.â The body
found floating in the bay at Sausallto
yesterday by the watchman of the
ferryboat San Rafael was Identified
this afternoon at the Morgue by W. S.
Shoemaker as that of Con O'Donnell, a
well-to-do resident of this city, who has
been missing for about two weeks.
From the circumstances connected with
his death the authorities believe the
man to have been murdered. O'Don
nell owned considerable property here
and was on the bonds of a town official.
Two weeks ago he went to San Fran
cisco to visit his cousin, John Farrell,
a Mission-street coal dealer. After
leaving' there he disappeared.
As O'Donnell was In good health, had
considerable property and was of a
naturally cheerful disposition, the sui
cide theory is generally scouted. When
he left- here he is said to have had
quite a sum of money on his person,
but at the time Coroner Eden held the
inquest only $20 in gold and $4 60 in
silver was in his pockets.
WORK AT SAN PEDRO
MAY BE STOPPED
Captain Meyler Is Dissatisfied With
the Quantity of Material
Furnished.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 4.â There is>
danger thai active operations upon the
San Pedro breakwater may at an early
day come to a temporary end.
Captain J. J. Mryler.who is in charge ot
the work on behalf of the Government,
hap notified the contractors that unless
there is at once decided Improvement in
the quantity of matftrlul furnished the
contract will be abrogated and the bond
of $300,000 furnished by FpUlr.ieyer & Nou
of Chicago, when that firm obtained the
contract, will bp declared forfeited.
Captain Meyler has not given thr> con
tractors any ultimatum specifying any
particular time when they must make
better progress. His orders in tho matter
have been of a very general character.
Stories rnve been in circulation for sev
eral Wtekfl to the effect that the con
tractors v.-ere preparing to throw up their
job and that the step to lie taken wns
to be part and parcel of another chapter
In th<- conspiracy which prevented the
harbor from becoming a reality years
earlier.
Captain Meyler to-flny gave It ag his
opinion that there Ik nothing In these
stories, while former l"nitofl Sfates Sena
tor Stephen M. White, who some time
ago investigated a similar rumor. Is also
of the opinion that these rumors are
groundless.
The harbor contractors have thus far
expended in the neighborhood of $200,000
upon their plant, upon which outlay but
a small cash return has been obtained.
Added to this the loss, if the contract
should be declared forfeited, will amount
to $600,000.
Copper Mines Sold.
TUSCON. Ariz., Oct. 4.â Another big
sale of copper properties was affected to
day. George H. Sisson and wife sold to
the Oki.lo Copper Company of New
Jersey thirty-five copper claims in the
Silver Bell district for $5,000,000. Th-se
mines are jp the same great copper belt
as the Roaemont, Helvetia, Azurlte and

all are bullion producers. It is understood
that the purchase to-day Is In the interest
of the Standard Oil Company.

State Department May Ob
ject to the Plan in the
Alaskan Dispute.
Ppeoial Dlppatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLING
TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, Oct. 4.â
The result of the arbitration of the Ven
ezuelan boundary will have an effect upon
the dispute with regard to the Alaskan
boundary. There will be less disposition
on the part of the United States to sub
mit to arbitration the establishing of the
line between Alaska and British Colum
bia than there has been hitherto, for the
work of the Venezuelan Commission
amply confirms what the State Depart
ment has always maintained about the
futility of getting rigidly just decisions
from boards of arbitration in boundary
disputes.
It is claimed from the reports which
come from Paris and from a study of the
map that the Venezuelan Commission,
after the manner of all similar commis
sions, simply split the difference and gave
to each of the contestants, as near as
might be, half of what wus in dispute.
That the action of the commission was
unanimous does not make it any more
manifest that the decision was based
strictly on a weighing of the claims and
rights. It only goes to show that a board,
made up as was the Paris board, is al
most certain to arrive at the easiest ar
rangement which promises to settle thÂ©
controversy without creating enough dis
satisfaction on either side to upset the
settlement, and while the State Depart
ment here is pleased that If any such de
cision was to be m.vie it should be an
nounced without a dissenting voice, there
is a disposition to question the absolute
justice of the conclusion.
A high official In the department paid
this afternoon that the United States
could not afford to have the Alaskan con
troversy treated in this way. It would
be absurd In view of our interpretations
of the treaties with historical precedence
and with the admission of British diplo
mats In old correspondence to permit any
kind of board to "split the difference" so
as to reach an agreement. The only ques
tion which the United States could agree
to submit to a board of arbitration would
be the proper interpretation of the lan
guage of the- treaties to see whether the
American contention as to their plain
meaning Is correct. We can never con
sent to allow a neutral board to fix metes
and bounds.
JUSTICE BREWER NOT
ENTIRELY SATISFIED
PARTS. Oct. 4.â A representative of the
Associated Press this evening had a con
versation with Justice Brewer of the
T'nlteil States Supreme Court regarding
the award of the Anglo-Venezuelan arbi
tration tribunal, from which it appears
that the deliberations of the court did
not proceed as smoothly and with the
spontaneous unanimity which a perusal
of the award would lead one to believe.
Justice Brewer, in reply to a question,
said:
'Tntll the last moment I believed a
decision would be quite impossible, and It
was by the greatest concentration and
mutual concessions that a compromise
was arrived at. If any of us had been
asked to have given an award each would
have given one differing in extent and
character. The consequence of this wa.s
that we had to adjust our different views
an<l finaily to draw a line running between
what each thought right."
Being asked whether political consid
erations influenced that award, the Jus
tice said he could not admit that, as such
an admission would reflect on the Judges,
but there was no doubt that the present
insurrection In Venezuela and the conse
quent feeling of instability weighed to a
certain extent in the balance.
In reply to an inquiry as to what ques
tions separated the Judges, Justice
Brewer said: "Nearly every point. In
the first place. European lawyers don't
look upon the question of prior rights re
sulting from rights of discovery in the
same way as we do. Thru the question of
the nature of control and the extent of

the influence and relationship with the
native races and many such matters are
not viewed in the came manner on either
side of the Atlantic. In fact, the whole
situation is not so keenly appreciated by
Europeans as it is by Americans."
Replying to a query regarding the de
liberations within the court, Mr. Brewer
said that there was. properly speaking, no
casting of votes. Each Judge conceded
something In turn. With regard to the
proceedings in open court, he said the
hearing of arguments might have been
considerably curtailed, had the case been
heard exclusively by either an English or
an American court, but the Judges
thought it prudent to all -v counsel full
liberty in order to make m Uters clearer
to the President who. after all. was not a
lawyer. Asked whether, according to his
own opinion, Venezuela was entitled to
more than she actually received, Justice
Brewer, after some hesitation, shrugged
his shoulders and said he would rather
say nothing on that subject and concluded
by remarking that, whatever these two
parties might think of the award, Vene
zuela received Barima Point, which gives
her full control of the interior of her ter
ritory and England is confirmed in the
possession of territory in the development
of which she has spent considerable
money and energy, but "the principal
blessing is that the two nations can at
1.-i^t develop peacefully side by side, large
tracts of territory, which, owing to the
previous antagonism, have remained un
productive."

It is but a few weeks ago since The Call made for
the proud record of being the first newspaper
in the world to obtain news ahead of any of it- con
by wireless telegraph, and now what
wa^ then but an experiment distrusted by many peo
ple ha- become a service so thoroughly worked out
that it can be relied upon to transmit accurately not
a few sentences only but an endless number of words
wide spaces of land or sea. In the course of
the yacht race there were transmitted from the steam
ship Ponce a- -he followed the yachts fifteen miles out
at sea upward of 2500 words in successive bulletins,
long or short, as the occasion required, and so per
fect was the operation of the system that not one
single word had to be repeated in order to make it
clear to the receiver.
The speed of the new system is marvelous. From the
?hip at sea the messages were transmitted to the land
Station in a time so brief as to be virtually instantane
ous and from that -nation, over a special leased wire,
they were forwarded to The Call and bulletined here
within two or three minutes after being written on
the Ponce. In other words, the public in San Fran
cisco watching The Call's bulletins had information
of every tack, every shifting of sails, every incident
of the race, within three minutes after the incident
occurred. Such a feat may well be accounted among
the supreme marvels of the closing years of a century
full of marvels.
From this time on the development of the new
telegraphy will go forward by leaps and bounds. It
\n;11 not be left to individual enterprise to exploit and
extend the potences that lie within it. The Govern
ment'- of the great nations of the earth will take it up
- and apply all their vast resources to carry it at once

are already actively pushing the work. They have
made tests extending over hundreds of miles and are
even now arranging to make a trial of sending a dis
patch through the air from England to Spain. Should
a war occur in the Transvaal at this time it Aould
matter little to the British if the Boers should man

Philippines and wiil soon be applied there, and dl
course will be developed to the utmost.
No man now living can <et limits to the potences of
Buch telegraphy. Since wires are no longer needed it
will be possible for man to eventually send a message
to as great a distance as he can generate electrical
energy to carry it. The tests already made show that
neither tall buildings, mountains, storms nor the cur
vature of the earth interferes. The electric message
goes on its way to where the prepared receiver awaits
it. finding no obstacle to check its course. Who can
say what may yet be done by man in the possession
of such a power?

INVOKING BLAINE.
O N anti-imperialist meeting being called to as
/ \ semble in Chicago, the Inter-Ocean of that
1 Â» city says: "Why should Chicago tolerate a
conference df anti-imperialist traitors any more than
it would tolerate a convention of acknowledged in
'jendiaries or anarchists? They should be handed over
to the United States officers and tried for treason."
Every loyal Republican feels keenly the impolicy of
such language used professedly in the interests of a
Republican administration. The imperialist press
which approves of it is engaged in conjuring with the
name of Blame, and uses the memory of that states
man to back up an imperial policy in the Philippines
and the West Indies. They are in the habit of con
j temptuously asking anti-imperialist Republicans what
i they think Blame would think of them if he were
! alive.
To this we reply that if he were alive and consistent
with his policy he would agree with President Mc-
Kinley that "forcible annexation is criminal aggres
-1 sipn, opposed to our ideas of national morality."
About tins there need be no mistake, for Biaine went
' upon record in the highest official sense upon this
subject and in terms that read like a prophecy of the
present situation.
In his instructions as Secretary of State, June 15,
1881, issued to General Kilpatrick, who was about to
sail as Minister to Chile, Mr. Blame discussed the war
between Chile and Peru and the taking of territory
by force and conquest as follows: "But at the con
clusion of a war avowedly not of conquest, but for the
solution of differences which diplomacy had failed to
settle, to make the acquisition of territory a sine qua
non of peace is calculated to casj suspicions on the
professions with which war was originally declared.
It may well be that at the termination of such a con
test the changed condition and relation of all the par
ties to it may make readjustment of boundaries or
territorial changes wise as well as necessary. But
this, where the war was not of conquest, should be
xhf result of negotiation and not the absolute prelim
inary condition upon which alone the victor consents
tc negotiate. At this day, when the right of people
to govern themselves, the fundamental basis of repub
lican institutions, is so widely recognized, nothing is
more difficult or more dangerous than the forced
transfer of territory, carrying with it an indignant and
hostile population, and nothing but .1 nec< ssity proven
before the world can justify it. It is not a case in
which the power desiring the' territory can be ac
cepted a^ a safe or impartial judge. * * * The
j Government of the Unit. Si believes that it is in
consonance with those principles, which arc professed
by all the republics of America, that such territorial
inges should be avoided as far as possible, and that
they should never be the result of mere force."
It is evident that if Blame were alive" and should
repeat that exact langu . I uld come under the
! Inter-Ocean'- classification oi traitors and be liable
to arrest and trial for treason. Had he foreseen what
iw going on he cou it no more
accurately. A war av< â  not for conquest has
been perverted in the interest of forcible annexation
1 of territory, carrying with it an indignant and hostile
people, against the principles upon which this and all
other American republics are founded. It is plain
that a Blame Republican cannot be an imperialist,
and that when imperialists use his name in support
of their schemes they do so in dense ignorance of aH
that he taught on the subject of territorial acquisi
tion.
He stood in everlasting denial of the right of a re
public to receive sovereignty of a territory regardless
of the protest of the people inhabiting it. He believed
in the right of self-government and would have
abhorred any man pretending to be a Republican
; who would deny it.
What are to be the consequences of going astray
from the principles of Blame may be seen in a recent
statetneni by that Republican leader, ex-Senator Hen
derson of Missouri, who says: "The Republican
party is not strong enough to change the constitution
of the United States. It will not be permitted to con
â¢ our Government into a mere military machine
to- wage wars of aggression abroad and silence the
voice of freedom at home. The Republican party
cannot lend itself to the schemes of adventurers who
seek new lands at public expense to exploit their
schemes for plunder. In my judgment millions of
Republicans in the United States entertain these
views, and we must all come to them sooner or Inter
; or else accept the alternative of eternal war, a stand
ing army, an enormous public debt, pensions beyond
endurance, renewed taxes upon consumption, carry
ing their exactions to every hearthstone in the land,
and, worse than all. a final surrender of our repub
lican simplicity for a government of imperialism."
Surely it is better for Republicans to leave imperial
ism to Morgan, Vest and its other Democratic advo
cates and promoter^, and stay with the straight and
patriotic Republicanism of Jame^ G. Blame.
It is not yet too late for .Mayor Phelan to estab
lish a wireless telegraphy station on Jasper McDon
ald or at least give that worthy chairman of the local
Democratic convention a typewritten copy of the
"slate."
The equanimity with which the people of the South
American republics slaughter each other, establish
and overturn Governments and repeat the perform
ance at the suggestion of an opportunity, indicates
that the business of war has become a diversion to the
hot heads of the south.
A MOVE ON CUBA.
THE Cuban- American League is at work again
trying to school American sentiment up to the
point of seizing Cuba in violation of our sol
emn national pledge. The newspapers which are in
this conspiracy attack those who want the country to
keep faith, using all the billingsgate necessary, and
showing that style of argument which may be ex
j pected of men to whom national honor is an empty
i name. The latest outbreak of these dishonorable
Americans appears in the St. Paul Pioneer-Press.
j That paper sees in the Spanish bonds secured on the
Cuban revenues a reason why our pledge should be
broken. It says: "So venal have large numbers of
the late insurgents become â the people who would
most probably control the independent government
should such be formed â that it is by no means certain
, they would not sell out for a reasonable proportion of
vhe spoils. It is impossible to believe that the intelli
gent among its population â those who alone should
have a voice in determining the island's destiny â will
| vote to incur the peril of such an obligation, in ad
dition to all other perils which would beset a re
public dominated by a mongrel population, ignorant
' of the alphabet of republicanism as well as of all other
alphabets. Whatever intelligent strength may be
given to the cause of Cuban independence and anti-
Annexation hereafter is to be mainly looked for in
the ranks of American anti-expansionists, allied with
lobbyists employed by the holders of Spanish obliga
tions, misnamed Cuban bonds."
There is the programme which the American people
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY. OCTOBER 5. 1899.
are asked to indorse. The Cuban bonds are the same j
as they were when Congress declared "the Cubans !
are and of right ought to be independent." The in- i
surgents are no better nor worse morally and politi- j
cally than they were when we placed them beside our 1
continental army. Not an Ethiopian mongrel among i
them has changed his skin. They are no less quali- j
fied for independence than when Congress declared j
they were and of right ought to be independent. !
They are no more ignorant of alphabets now than !
then. In no respect nor particular has the situation
changed, so far as their right to independence goes,
since we promised it to them. We said nothing then |
about only the intelligent among them having a j
voice in public affairs. We have discovered nothing !
in them that was not known when our promise was
made.
True, it is the law of nations that public debts are
not repudiated by a change of sovereignty. The is
sue presented is whether by forcible annexation
against the will of the real majority of the people we
will divert the wealth of the island to tht enrichment
of a few favored American exploiters or by keeping
our pledge will permit the people to compound or
repudiate the Cuban bonds as they please, either de
voting the wealth of the island to their payment in
whole or in part, or by repudiation keeping that
wealth for themselves.
We arc strong enough to repudiate the Cuban
bonds if we are dishonorable enough to repudiate our
own solemn pledge of independence. But let us go
about it frankly and not with a floursack mask such
as stage robbers wear.
It is not true that France, where most of these
bonds are held, could as a Government "make such
. a display of force as Cuba, unaided, could not dream
of resisting." If she could under the law of nations
appear as the armed collector of claims held by indi
viduals, that right is not in the least affected by an
nexation of Cuba to the United States. It would re
main as a slumbering cause of war, to be used in
any time of national weakness or peril that might
come to us.
There is no modern case of a nation appearing
under such circumstances as a bill collector. The
English management of Egyptian finances is not such
a case. No foreign Government could enforce the
payment of Cuban bonds, except by such an asser
tion of force as involves violation and defiance of the
Monroe doctrine, which the world knows this Gov
ernment will not permit. If France should attempt
it it would require the installation of French sov
ereignty over the Cuban revenues and their source
in the industries of the island. Every American who
knows the alphabet knows such a thing is absurd.
Yet this absurdity serves the purpose of the league
j of dishonor which is preparing to steal Cuba.
The dispatches are authority for the assertion that
the people of Chicago intend to make desperate efforts
to decorate their city in honor of a prospective visit
of Admiral Dewcy. Whenever Chicago attempts any
thing, from a riot to a strike, there may be an
absolute reliance that it will be desperate.
PRESIDENT WHEELER'S ADDRESS.
px RESIDENT WHEELER'S address to the
Ly students at Berkeley has the ring of true elo
* quence. He might have marshaled with the
skill of the ablest rhetorician a multitude of lofty
words concerning ideals of art and science and phil
osophy into sonorous phrases and massive sentences
and yet have achieved less in the way of affecting the
understanding, the imaginations and the hearts of
men than he did by an address so simple as to hardly
seem skillful at all, and yet so full of the truest wis
dom and sympathy that it will be read by the whole
people of California with as much delight as it was
listened to by the students.
The central thought of the address is that a univer
sity is not a thing of statutes, reports, buildings,
mechanisms and observances, but a living organism,
an association of men and women. "From this
l:our," he said, "I know that I am a member in a
real and living association, because I am joined in
association with men. The only thing that is of in
terest to me in a university is men and women. As
long as I live I trust I may never be interested in a
university of mechanisms, reports and paper, but only
in a university of human beings."
For a moment the president, under the inspiration
of the scene and the occasion, indulged the glow of
poetry and of prophecy. "This," said he, "is a stim
ulating sight This golden sunshine coming down
in genial, lazy haze, smiling upon the ripened brown
of these magnificent hills, remind me of my beloved
Greece. It is more than Hollas that we have here.
Greece looked out toward the old oriental world;
Berkeley looks out through the Golden Gate toward
the oriental world that has meaning for to-day."
From the alluring theme set forth in that picture
of the university and the far-reaching world and life
that stretches out from it over the ocean and through
future ages the orator turned to the more important
subject of the university itself. Concerning that he
said: 'This university is a living thing; the real
university is alive. Blood pulses through its veins,
The spiritual life of the men who have gone before
is in it. It is not a thing of building, nor of statutes,
cor of courses; it is a thing of life. And what you
will get out of this university that is worth your
while, that will stand by you, is what you will get
out of association with it as a living thing. Therefore
I say we are not a mechanism for providing people
with equipment; we are alive, we have a heart. And
to the family life I charge you students of the Univer
sity of California be loyal. It is worth your while.
It is your duty. Be loyal to the university. Be loyal
to all its parts. Say that you love it. Those who
take the misunderstandings and the quarrels of the
inside to ventilate them in the outside world arc
traitors to us. (Applause.) We are a family.
You cannot make a university out of minds and
brains. In a university, as elsewhere in the world,
heart is more than heads, and love is more than rea
son. Hold you fast to that love for this university.
Stand strong, shoulder to shoulder, when you do its
wGrk. Let every man according to his ability do
what the university asks of him, and let every man do
in support of the other man's work what he can. 1 '
It would be well if the sentiment of those words
could find abiding place in the minds of all Califor
nians whether students of the university or not. A
State is itself an association of living beings hav
ing mutual interests and aspirations. Loyalty to it
should be a part of the mental and moral life of every
one of its members. There should be among all citi
zens that helpfulness and co-operation which are
necessary to the speedy realization of the glorious
possibilities that lie before it.
It is gratifying to have in the high office of presi
dent of the State University a man whose scholar
ship has not estranged him from sympathy with the
common run of men and who does not value learning
or culture above the men and women with whom he
has to deal. His influence is certain to be felt far
beyond the bounds of Berkeley, and all California will
be in some measure benefited by his presence, his in
fluence and his work.

Special Pippatrh to Th<? Call.
JACKSON. Oct. 4.-The mining en
! gineers to-day saw new developments in
| deep mining in the mother lode in Amador
j County, after yesterday's Interesting ob
| servations of new surface operations by
| gold dredges In Butte County, and the
I day has been one of the most Interesting
jof the trip. The party woke up at [one
I and in the early forenoon a number of
j carriages provided by the local com
i mits â¢ â  of the California Miners' Asso-
I elation and citizens bore the guests In
three parties to Jackson, Sutter Creek
and Amador City, all within twenty
miles.
i The party put in the day in enjoying the
. hospitality of these thriving mining
I towns and In seeing some of the great
â¢ mother lode mines strung like iewels be
tween Amador City and Jackson.
Among the mil visited were the Key
stone, Lincoln, Wildman and Mahoney.
The scattering parties went through the
mills and . rally into the depths of
these great mines. They learned that all
those old mines are just now experienc
ing a second birth, developing now and
j great riches and sinking new shafts to
j depths of irom 2000 to 3500 feet. In no part
: of the State could so strong a presenta
< tion of the great future possibilities of
! the mother lode be given. A map of this
j section of the mother lode accompanied
j a very neat programme of the local tour,
I prepared by the committee of which E.
iC. Voorh ms was a leading spirit. Sutter
i Creek presented an arch of welcome.
To-morrow more mines will be visited
j and royal hospitality will be extended
jat the Gwin mine at noon. Carriages
I will take the party on to Villa Springs.
j where the mining tour will oracticaTly
! end. The Eastern party will " give six
i days to th Yosemlte Valley and then go

While Entering Bacoor River
After the Fight.
MANILA, Oct. 4.â Several hundred
insurgents have reoccupied Porac,
which was captured by General Mar-
Arthur ":i September 20 and evacuated
by the Americans the following day.
The insurgent forces are reported mov
ing toward Mexico, southeast of An
gejes.
The object of the double movement
is apparently to get behind the Ameri
can garrison on both sides of the Ma
nila-Dagupan railway.
Reconnaissances from Mexico by the
Fourth cavalry toward Santa Ana,
northeast of Mexico and toward Ara
yat, due north of Santa Ana, devel
oped the fact that the insurgents are
in position at both points. An Ameri
can private was killed in the skirmish
at Santa Ana. The Arayat party
learned that Scott and Edwards of the
Twenty-fifth Infantry, who are miss-
Ing, are prisoners at Magayalene.
The insurgents made two attacks on
Calamba, in which the commanding of
ficer rep< rts fifty Filipinos killed and
many wounded. Two companies of the
Twenty-first Regiment repelled each
attack, losing two men killed and seven
wounded.
8010 men surprised an outpost near
Guagufl, killing two privates. The
"thi-r two escaped.
While four sailors of the United
States cruiser Baltimore were entering
the Bacoor River in a boat yesterday
after the fight they received a volley,
wounding three. It is understood that
the volley came from I'nited States
lers wh,., having been ordered to
prevent the passage of boats, fired by
mistake on the Baltimore's men.

CALLS OUR SOLDIERS
DRUNKARDS AND RAKES
NEW YORK, Oct. 4.â Army Secre
tary Peyton of the Brotherhood of St.
Andrew, who has just returned from a
Btay of six months in the Philippines,
res that the United States has
"45,000 drunken rakes and gamblers" in
and around Manila, and that religious
progress Is quite out of the question
while American soldiers are there." He
says the Roman Catholic priests have
made up with the Tagalos and are
losing no time and sparing no money
to tell the Filipinos that the Americans
now in Manila have made the city a
"hell hole" to a civilian. In an inter
view he said:
Without qualifying exceptions, the Ta
galos are the most moral and most relig
ious people 1 ever saw, but they are mere
children In ability to govern themselves.
It would never do, in my judgment, for
the United States to abandon them.
At â :â¢ present time there is no chance
for Protestant effort. l? is practically
useless to undertake to do anything there
until the United States troops depart or
reform. The United States has In and
around Manila at this moment about 45,000
drunkards, rakes and gamblers. Of course
there are exceptions, but they are not
worth mentioning. When the American
troops landed in Manila there was only a
saloon or two in the whole place. To-day
Manila is a hell hole. There are 050 or
more saloons, the typical places of the
Western frontier, or worse, and the sa
loons are more respectable than are many
of the other places within the city which
Americans have either planted or kept
alive by their support.
When the insurrection was at its height
many Spanish priests were driven out and
left the Island. With the coming of the
American? a common danger has brought
the Tagalos and Spaniards together, and
old sores have been healed. To-day not
only Luzon but the islands in the west
and south are covered with friars, who
are active as they never were before.

Under the Present Mining Laws an
American Has Very Little Op

in Dawson.

BY HOL HOFFMAN.
I JUNEAU, Alaska. Sept. 26.â General H.
' I. Willey, formerly Surveyor General of
, the State of California and well known
in San Francisco, has just returned from
j a round trip of Alaskaâ that is, from Ju
i neau to Juneau. Me went by way of the
I Yukon, touching at Dawson and all the
principal points on the river and at Cape
' Nome. He traveled 43>jO miles and waa
! gone eight weeks. He said with close con
' nections he could have made the entire
; distance In twenty-four traveling days.
i General Willey will make a trip to Sitka,
where he Is interested in the Pande Basin
, Gold Mining Company, and in a few
! weeks he will go to New York, probably
! returning by way of San Francisco about
Christmas. Concerning Cape Nome, he
said:
"Cape Nome is a wonderful place. Yes,
it is going to be a hot town next winter,
and it is also Suing to be a very cold town.
It is the coldest place on earth, and windy
, âthere's nothing in Alaska like it. Dr.
I Call waa on the same boat with me from
St. Michael to Cape Nome. He was with
Lieutenant Francis in the reindeei â¢ \
pedition to Port Clarence. He says they
; had more trouble with the cold and wi! 1
I on the plains back of Cape Nome than
; any other place in the north. It is op< n
I (in the north, east and south, there being
a low range of mountains a considerable
distance away on the west, but the wind
does net come from the west. The build
ings art- nothing but shehs of boards hi.'';
: will give very little protection against the
storms.
"Norton Soand freezes over and the
1 winds pile the ice high, probably about
:Â«' per cent of the population want to leave
Nome for the winter, but not one in
five will !>(â  able to get away. There will
not be ships to tarry them.
"When the beach diggings were discov
i ered many men who had claims on the
temporarily deserted them, pre
ferring to work for a sure thing rather
than where there was nothing yet in
\ Their idea may have been to use
their savings to develop the creek claims
"The beach diggings an- peculiar,"
continued General Willey. "I never saw
nor heard of anything quite like them. In
the first place, about two-thirds ol
gold is lost. It is very fine, almost as fine
.: >ur. it Is found in black and ruby
sand. This sand Is on a thin layer of day.
fnmi wh'.ch the sand is scraped. There are
usually three such layers of day, but I
,never heard of inybody going down
â¢:. where there are doubtless other
rs '>f clay. One reason f<>r this may
!"â¢ that If they went lower the water
might come in on them. I do not think
more than one-third of tl - >ld Is saved.
Th re are several ways to account for the
great loss. The rock< ra are as a rule very
i r ide. Â« !< nsiderable of tire gold has a thin
coating of rusty iron, and for that reason
; will nut hold to tho plates. Then the black
is almost as heavy as the gold and
n impediment.
"The )'< ach is on^n to all comers, and
there will be a sight there next summer
that will hardly tâ â  eh n again In a cen
tury. From the time of the discovery nf
â¢thf- beach digcings prospecting In the
surrounding country was practically
abandoned. I saw the cold with my own
>â¢>â¢Â» s taken out on the beach and creeks.
On the beach they are m iking from $3 to
â¢ â¢!â¢ day to tho man. just as they hap
pen to <t:ikÂ« it. Cape Nome promises to
, rival I tawÃon.
"Dawson Is the toughest town on earth.
Vice is flaunted openlyâ ricrht in
your face. You must see; you
can't get away from it. Of rnnr : v
there are localities just as bad
in San Francisco, Chicago New York,

I do not think the mining laws ever will

"1 wouldn't live hi Dawson and drink
that foul water for all the gold there. I
â  i . though, waterworks are nearly
completed and that will make it much
better. Dawson is a dirty townâ dirty in
every sense of the word. But they are

The Hay Market.
The circular of Somers & Co. says:
"There Is no especially Interesting 1 fact thÂ«t
can be noted In connection with the marketing
of hay for the past few days, nor, in fact, for
the past few weeks. Heavy shipments have
been made right along and everybody has been
quite busy handling their consignments, filling
up their consumers, â¢â 'â â  This has been con
tinued steadily up to the present time, but It
may reasonably be expected that very shortly
a decided change In the demand may be noted.
Gradually the different storehouses and iofts
throughout the town and country are becoming;
filled and when a certain number are off the
hay market will begin to drag. We trust that
when this time comes the fields will be quite
well cleaned out, that the market may not be
overcrowded with shipments, so that we may
go into the winter season with matters In fair
shape. Because of the present discouraging
prices many farmers have manageito put away
at least a portion of their crops, hoping to find
a much better market later on, and we trust
that they may not be disappointed, for upon
their prosperity, directly or indirectly, depends
the welfare of our city, and, in fact, a.ll com
mercial centers throughout the country. It
way reasonably be expected that within a
month or two we may see an advance over the
present range of prices of from $1 to $2 per ton.
Anything further than this will be brought
about only by a dry season or some unexpected
even which cannot be foreseen at the present
time.
"The demand for strictly gilt-edge wheat hay
continues fairly good, while most other grades
are dragging along; in an uninteresting way.
Alfal;a is coming in very plentifully and seems
to be wavering somewhat. The demand for
this particular quality seems to be lessening
materially and prices are from 25c to 50c per
ton off all around."
New York Dri-ed fruit Market.
Mall advices from New York say: 'â¢There is
no lmDrovement in the general situation in
the dried fruit market. Trading la light and
prices unchanged at previous range with the
exception of raisins. Orders from local buy
ers and nearby orders are scarce and distant
buyers takf only a few of each variety, appar
ently to keep up assortments. No business of
importance is expected until after the cele
bration :.; over.
â¢â¢Raisin prict-s were announced yesterday and
wore higher than last year, though not much
different from what bad been published in the
Commercial as the probable opening price. The
reason ened for the hither range is the
smaller crop, but the entire clean-up of old
taoclc has been quite as influential probably.
It is expected that sales will Increase now and
that movement will be active as soon as new
crop goods begin to come forward.
"The activity of prunes is somewhat ham
pered by the continued reports that the Cali
fornia crop will be . 100,000 pounds, or 23.000,
--000 larger than laat year. The shortage In Ore
gon will have very little effect, except pos
sibly on the Fupply of large sizes, owing to the
fact that the new orchards which have come
Into bearing in California will more than make
the deficiency. Only Oregon growers suf
fer. The trade will scarcely know the differ
ence. Prices on all goods are about steady and
movement Into consumption Is about an aver
ii(,-e, though not especially large. Sales of new
crop continue small, but rumors of negotia
tions for large blocks are constant.
"Peaches are Â»H?htly firmer and held a frac
ti';;i higher on the coojt, particularly the small
sizes, which appear to have been 'light freely
by Western operators for speculative purposes.
K-irpre sizes are dull, trade being limited to
relatively small orders.
"Apricots are only quiet, with occasional sales
of hmall quantities. Exporters take consider
able blocks, but as a whole the trade Is dull."

tober taxes in New York, which have been
; paid with unusual promptness, are finding
1 their way back Into the banks, and a plan is
reported to redeem at once in advance of ma
; turity about $12,000,000 of New York bonds
; issued In anticipation of taxes. The prospect of
some relief thus offered and the continued stiff
ness of the money rate was not much regarded
In the stock market. It is not expected, how
j ever, that money will work to an easy basis
; for some time to come. Six per cent is bid for
i time loans, but very little is offered on those
i terms.

TREASURY EXH AUSTED.
No Money to Pay School Teachers
Until December.
Auditor "Wells had a busy day yester
day. In the morning lie held a lengthy
conference With the entire Board of
Health and George Knight, Its attorney,
which resulted In his serving formal no
tice on that body that he would audit
no liar}' claims not drawn directly upon
its own fund; in the afternoon he had the
teachers to explain to. Although he au
dited the September salary claims of the
pedagogues, the Treasurer announced yes
torday that the city was broke, and that
i there would be no more payments made
I until the tax collections began to come
in. That means that It will be along in
the latter part of November or the first
of December before the school teachers
will get a cent, no matter how hard they
have worked. There Is no danger of their
losing anything; it is simply a case of
wait, and Treasurer Truman says every
one Will have to make the best of Jt.
Want Cremation Laws.
Nearly ail of the prominent physicians
of the, city have signed a petition which
was yesterday filed with the Board of Su
pervisors, asking that body to enact such
laws a* will prevent the Crimea of mur
der and malpractice being concealed by
: the cremation of the bodies of victims
The petition points out that under pres
ent regulations the concealment of any
such crimes is a matter of comparative
ease. The petition is indorsed by the
members of the Board of Health, and a
number of its signers will appear at the
next meeting: of the Supervisors to urge
the necessity of some such enactment as
they suggest.

| last evening was an unqualified success.
| As an Initial and novel venture it won
! the support of the members and the en
j thusiastic applause of the guests.
The gymnasium was the scene of the
entertainment, and there was not a va
cant seat when the programme of the
evening was begun. Three sparring bouts
i made up the first* part of the entertain
ment. 8. Simpson and C. Mil ward
heavy-weights, mixed things in good prize
ring fashion. After they had gone the
limit P. J. Racconl and J. F. McCarthy
welters, donned the mitts and won the
commendation of the spectators by their
clever fistic performance. The middle

scratched from the programme on ac
, count of the non-appearance of A.Â«t W
J. Leonard and AY*. Cole completed the
pugilistic end of ,the evening's show
With the boxing completed gymnastics

performers. A perch act by Flsta and
a young Filipino was the next act. and
it was well received. "Wrestling by Harry
Cobb. J. J. Phillips, Arthur Brurhan and

DAWSON CITY GOLD
EXPEDITION WRECKED
ALAMEDA, Oct. 4.â Two gold-hunting
expeditions ln which Alameda people cen
tered a great deal of interest and in which
considerable Alameda capital was invest
ed have come to naught.
When thn first expedition, that of the
F.\ Bueno purty. started out the hopes of
the owners and financial backers of the
affair mn high, and the vessel had not
fairly got started on Its course before the
Dawpon City expedition was instituted
and the construction of a steam dredger
began for the purpose of dredging in the
Yukon for the yellow metal.
The Brat named expedition proved an
unprofitable venture and a number of the
members returned home. Others made
their way to the new discoveries and are
still ln the gold regions. A few weeks ago
word was received here that the El Sueno,
the crack yacht of the En<Mnal Yacht i
Club and which co-u $."500. had grounded j
on a sanubar in the river and was sold by i
one of the members of the party for less I
than $100. The boat was afterward got :
off the reef without injury and put to use I
on the river.
The members of the Dawson City expe
dition seem to have fared no better than
their fellow-townsmen on the El Sueno. i
After a voyage of numerous mishaps the i
vessel finally reached the Yukon, but !
owing to numerous difficulties encountered I
the venture proved a failure. Numerous
reasons were assigned for the failure of j
the expedition. Some attributed it to the !
way in which the board of directors han- I
died the expedition and others laid the
Mama to the lack of experience of the j
men who had accompanied the steamer to j
the Yukon. Joseph A. Leonard Â«.f this 1
City, who was formerly manager of the
expedition, spent a week aboard the
steamer in the month of July of this year.
He was unable to do anything, as there
was not sufficient of the crew left to
h:nidle the machinery. In a letter to a '
friend in this city Frank Woodrum. a !
member of the Dawson City expedition, j
now at Rampart City, says as follows:
The Dawson City expedition has been
shamefully wrecked by the action of
the board of directors ln Ban Fran
cisco, when. I think, if it had teen i
properly managed, It would have paid
handsome dividends. I do not know
what motive the board had for taking
the management out of Leonard's
hands, so I think, to be charitable, we
should attribute it to no motive at all,
but to gross ignorance.
The following Alamedans were share
holders In the El Sueno and Daw=on City
expeditions: E. K. Taylor. Joseph A.
Leonard, Michael Kane. Frank and John
Woodrum, Victor Mockie, George Leon
ard, Charles Kane. Paul and Etlmond
Buckley. A great deal of money was
spent in fitting '>ut the expeditions, and
thus far nothing but "Irish dividends"
have been declared.
FROM ALTAR
TO GRAVE
OAKLAND, Oct. 4.â ln the same
j( )! parlor where little more than a
\L^ year ago all was joyful over the
wedding of Miss Mabel Flthlan
Hyde to John Rule her funeral cere
monies were conducted this afternoon

tended the former event. The death of
Mrs. Rule occurred suddenly at Bii*
bee,, Ariz., after a few days' illness.
Her husband recently completed a
beautiful home at Blsbee and he and
his wife had not been there many
weeks when Mrs. Rule was attacked
with the sickness that so soon ended
fatally.
The deceased was the stepdaughter
of Mrs. Philip Boograr, and for some
time after the marriage she resided at
the Boogar residence in this city. Her
husband brought the remains back to
Oakland for interment. The services
were conducted by Rev. Mr. Fraser of
the East Oakland Presbyterian
Church. The remains were borne to
the grave by members of Tecumseh
Tribe. Order of Red Men, and many
members of the order and friends sent
beautiful floral offerings.

PRISONERS NOT
TO BE WORKED
ON THE STREETS
Chain Gangs Are Too
Expensive.
Oakland Office San Francipco Call.
906 Broadway. Oct. 4.
; Chief of Police Hodgklns does not agree
with Councilman Girard regarding the
; working of prisoners on the streets.
, A few wÂ«eks ago Councilman Girard
I wanted the Council to authorize the
I Board of Police and Fire Commissioners
!to order prisoners to work making new
j streets. The matter was referred to the
j Chief of Police and this morning he filed
; the following report with the board:
I have examined the books of the depart- '
ment for the months of April. May, June. July. i
August and September, 189?, in "order to find j
| out how many prisoners could be worked on
the streets. and I find the number varies very
much. I Bod the average number for April,
Ma; and June would have been about twenty,
while the number for July, August and Sep
tember would have been but eleven. That is
not figuring on the number of men who would
not be able to work on account of sickness.
In my judgment the most important reasons
why the resolution providing for the working
oj prisoner? upon the roadways of the city
shculd not pass are that about two-thirds of
the prisoner* confined in the City Prison are
servlr.g sentences for drunkenness, which are
generally three days. and. therefore, the men '
sent out to work would be chunged every day,
with very few exceptions, and a man the next
clay after a debauch is not in a fit condition
to work; so, out of each three days' sentence
on one man. but two days' work would be
done, and those who do work would not do on-- I
thlrd as much work as an ordinary man work
ing for wages.
All who work will have to be given three
meals a day. which will increase the cost of
feeding prisoners one-third, besides the extra '
ccal used for cooking. Most of them would ,
have to be furnished overalls, Jumpers and i
j shoes to work In, which would increase the |
amount paid for clothing materially. The
patrol wagon would have to take them to work
In the morning, return them to ; the City j
Prison for dinner, then take them to their I
work, and at night return them to th? City '
: Prison, making four trips a day, which would J
ccrsume some time, find should there be a call I
for the wagon they would have to wait until
Its return, thereby seriously affecting the effi
; ciency of the patrol service. It would require
i the services of two police officers to take j
charge of them while at work, thereby mak
ing the department two men short.
Since IS9I all vagrants convicted in our Po
lice Court are sent to the County Jail to serve I
out their sentence. Prior to that time, and ;
when prisoners were being worked on our j
streets, vagrants were confined In thÂ» City
Prison and helped materially to swell the num
ber of available men to work on the streets.
With prisoners working on the street!" |
j escapes must be expected, unless they work
with a ball and chain, and that is somesthlhg
I hardly expect any one to suggest.
The working of prisoners has been tried
three or four times by the city and proved an
expensive failure, and it would, in my opinion,
add greatly to the expense of the police de
partment without material gain to the city.
S. C. HODGKINS, Chief of Police.
After the reading of the report the
; Mayor Introduced a resolution stating
i that as the Chief of Police found it would
1 not be profitable to work prisoners the
! Board concurs in this opinion. This ends ;
' the matter.
A "CYCLONE"
REVIVALIST
OAKLAND. Oct. 4.â The Union
Methodist revival opened to
night, and the First Church was
crowded. Enthusiasm has been
aroused in the seven Methodist
churches in this city similar to that
which attended the great Mills revival
some years ago.
"The cyclone evangelist," J. H.
Weber, was In charge of the revival
and some of his unusual methods
greatly surprised his Oakland audi
ence. . In introducing him Rev. Dr.
Dille said that the visitor was very
much in earnest, and that if he did
anything that seemed strange no one
need feel afraid, for he had proved
that to turn out a finished article
every workman must use his own
mean?.
Evangelist Weber gave an interest
ing little skitch of his life, showing
that the forty-four years be baa lived
have not been very different from
those of many other people. In his
young days he quit drinking because
he f oared the reform?. tory. It was
v.hile listening to a Baptist preacher
that he decided to leave the Roman
Catholic faith and join a Methodist
church. From a local preacher he
graduated into the ministry after
passing four years at a university in
Ohio. Twn years later he traveled
through Europe and tho Holy Land
to fit himself for the work of an evan
gelist. He has held revivals at near
ly every large city In the country.
Evangelist Weber will hold services
every evening this week except Satur
day in Dr. DiUt'l church.
BERKELEY'S FOOTBALL
CAPTAIN INJURED
BERKELEY. Oct. 4.-Jim Whipple.
Berkeley's football captain, was hurt
while practicing on the gridiron this
afternoon, and as a consequence may
have to be laid off for two or three wwk?.
Whipple's Injury consists of a badly
wrenched shoulder, one of the ligaments
being torn off. The accident happened
while the team was all heaped up in a
scrimmage- It Is thought that Whipple
tackled a man with the ball and the rest
of the players piled themselves up on top
of him. As the heap became disentangled
it was found that Whipple'? right
shoulder Had been injured. While the
accident is not very serious It Is doubtful
whether thÂ«? U. C. men will see their
captain bnck on the gridiron for some
weeks to come.

IDA IS THE
WINNER AT
UNION PARK
I Hawker, the Runner - Up,
Withdrawn in the
Final.
Handy & Smith's Ida was the winner
of the midweek Reserve stake at Union
Coursing Park yesterday afternoon. Ida
showed great form and won on her mer
its, although the result might have been
different if Hawker, the runner-up, had
been in condition to test the final with
her. The English dog, however, after
beating everything entered against him
up to that time, ran a bye in the fourth
round with Eclipse that took the starch
out of him completely. The hare* was
remarkably swift and led the dogs such
a long chase that it became necessary to
send out a third dog. who finally killed.
j Kay & Trant, the owners of Hawker,
! then decided to withdraw him from the
I tlnal, which went to Ida by default.
It was a perfect day for the sport and
I the hares were all fast and tricky, so
I much so that Madge Wildfire, the relief
dog, was called upon no less than four
times. Shortenders won in a few in

DEWEY CAUSES MORE
SHIPS TO BE SENT
Upon the Advice of the Admiral
Many Additional War Vessels
Will Be Dispatched to
the Philippines.
CAT T. HEADQUARTERS. WEL-I
LINGTON HOTEL, WASHING
TON, Oct 4 Admiral Dewey has
(riven his unqualified approval
of the declaration made by the
President that there shall be no falter- |
ing in maintaining tlv victory won by
him at Manila Hay. He has gone fur
immended that
the naval force In the Philippines be
materially Increased* and that all
3 possible be empl >yed in order to
crush the rebellion. This advice was
given during an extended confer
which he had with the President to
day. Concerning this conference Act
ing Secretary Allen said to-night:
"Tl â  extended In- j
terview with Admiral Dewey to-day,
who earnestly recommended that the
Brooklyn and some other vessels
it once to the Philippines. Bydi- i
rection of the President the Secretary
of th>' Navy has Issued an order to thai
I and such vessels will be put in
readiness at once. Among others prob
ably the Marietta and Machias will be
designated."
Officially thlp is all that is paid con
cerning the interview. There is good au- I
thority, however, for the statement |
that, in making his recommendation, '
Admiral Dewey supported them with
these reasons:
Believing vvth the President that a i
vigorous policy should be pursued In
suppr. ssing the. insurrection, he thinks '
that by increasing th" force on the i
Asiatic station it will be possible to en
a stricter blockade and prevent
Bupplles and munitions of war from
reaching the insurgents.
The moral effect of the presence of
puch a formidable force as will be sent
to the Aslatio station will h<? to con
vince the insurgents of the purpose of
the administration to compel th-Mr rec
ognltion of sovereignty of the United j
Btates. Undoubtedly the administra
tion considered also the effect upon the
world at large of th~ presence of such |
i* formidable squadron, though perhaps
the admiral did not advance this as a j
reason for increasing the command,
and there is certainly nothing to indi
cate that any action contemplates the
recognition of the belligerency of Agui
naldo's government.
In addition to the three vessels desig
nated others will go. The New Orleans,
attached to the North Atlantic squad
ron; the Albany, her sister ship, near
ing completion in England; the Mono
cacy in China, which Admiral Dewey
says is seaworthy, and the Nashville,
now at San Domingo, may be assigned.
There are also available for service in
the Philippines, should it be decided to
send them, the Atlanta, which has been
made over at the New York Navy
yard; the Bancroft, awaiting commis
sion at Boston; the Scorpion, now at
New York, and the Vixen, at Bluefields,
Nicaragua. All these vessels will not
â  nt. but it is intended to give Ad
miral Watson a formidable fleet, and
the ships to be sent him will be sent
from this lot. Including those captured
from the Spanish Government, Admiral
Watson's squadron now consists of
thirty-two vessels. When reinforce
m< nt arrives at Manila he will prob
ably transfer his flag to the Brooklyn.
]!-â  will then have command of one bat
tleship, one armored cruiser, two moni
tors, two protected cruisers and
twenty-four gunboats, besides supply
ships, etc.

tion with the earnest support given by

Admiral Dewey to the policy of Presi
dent McKinley to pursue a vigorous
campaign.
The admiral, It Is stated, even went
further find expressed his strong con
viction that the United States should
retain permanent control of the Philip
pines. During the interview he spoke
of the great value of the islands to the
United States from a commercial stand
point, emphasizing what many officers
have said about the immense resources
of the islands.
Concerning the future government of
the islands the admiral agreed fully
â¢with the views which have been ex
pressed by President Sehurman. He
said he favored American control
through the medium of a commission
or a civil governor, but great latitude
should bf> allowed for local government
<>f the Pixty or more tribes, so that the
adminstration of affairs could be ad
justed to meet their different habits
and conditions.
President Schurman was in the city
and had a conference with Secretary
Long. In nn interview he paid that the
commission would hold its first session
in this city early in November. Admiral
I'ewey is here. Colonel Denby and Pro
r Worcester are nearing San
Francipco, and Mr. McArthur, secre
tary of the commission, sailed to-day
from Yokohama bringing the records
of thf commission. The clerical force
will remain at Manila, which may indi
cate that the President will direct the
commission to return to the Philippines
before the close of the dry season.
Thf* adoption of Admiral Dewoy'a
recommendation as to Increasing the
squadron gives some token of the
Btrictness of the blockade which it is
Intended to enforce. Reports received
from Hear Admiral Watson since Ad
miral Dewey's departure from Manila
show that rice and hemp have appre
ciated in value 330 per cent and that in
return for the exports of these products
munitions of war are being received by
the insurgents.
The fact as to the long coast line of
Luzon and the ease with which goods
may be landed in one island and
transported to another has been fully
explained to the officials and this has
made the Pr< Bident more ready to fol
low the admiral's advice. It is appar
ently not Intended to proclaim a for
mal blockade, but rather to enforce a
local blockade, which will prevent it
from assuming international signifi
cance.
DEWEY DETACHED
FROM THE OLYMPIA
WASHINGTON, Oct. Admiral j
Dewey went to see Secretary Long
early to-day to talk over his plans far;
the Immediate future.
Secretary Long promptly gave notice
that the department was willing to j
give him perfect 'liberty to do as he j
pleased. The admiral was therefore at
his instance detached formally from
the Olyxnpia after this date. He tele- i
graphed the executive officer at Tomp- j
kinsville to haul down his flag, and thus I
terminated his connection with the j
cruiser which for more than two years j
has been his home.
In accordance with projects already j
planned, the admiral will go to Ver- ]
mont Monday as the guest of W. ]
Seward "Webb, Shellburn Farms, near |
Burlington.
After a reception at the State Capi
tol, on the 13th inst., he will go .to Bos
ton to attend the reception there in his
honor on the 14th inst. The Olympia
will meanwhile have arrived at that j
place, for her orders, issued to-day, j
are to proceed at once from New York !
to Boston to be put out of commission
and be extensively repaired.
After the Boston ceremonies Admiral j
Dewey is expected to return to Wash- :
ington to meet his colleagues of the ,
Philippine Commission. Secretary Long
to-day said that the admiral's time
probably would be fully occupied in
the deliberations of the commission for
some months to come, and meanwhile,
in order to leave him free for this work,
he will not be assigned to any naval I
duties. Further than this point the ,
department has not yet undertaken to
define Its plans for Admiral Dewey 's j
future.
PLANNING A TRIP
TO THE PACIFIC COAST
WASHINGTON, Oct. 4.â lt developed
to-day that Admiral Dewey is planning
a Western trip this fall that will take
in Chicago and extend to the Pacific
Coast. The fact was not made known
in the formal exchange of compliments
between the admiral and the Chicago
committee, but he informed General
Anderson that he was expecting to
make such a trip. It is supposed the
tour will be made in November.
Senator Proctor discussed the pro
poppd trip with considerable interest
nnd said it would be quite elaborate
and in the nature of a continental tour.

STRIKE OF MACHINISTS

VANCOUVER. B. C, Oct. 4.â The gen

Pacific Railway from Fort William to
Vancouver began this morning, when the
mechanics of the focal shops went out on
strike. This action was taken on orders

state th;it they v.-ill bo joined by all their

given as a reason for the strike-.
General Superintendent Marpole of the

Winnipeg and in sympathy with that
point the local men have quit work.

BOERS NOW THREATEN
THE NATAL FRONTIER
Transvaal Situation Is Considered Most Critical
and England Is Preparing to Send
an Increased Army.
LONDON, Oct. 5.â A special dispatch from Newcastle, Natal, dated
Wednesday, says; The Boers have left the laager at Volksrust and are moving
toward the frontier. The situation is most critical. The magistrates and muni
cipal officers have assembled in the Town Hall to concoct measures for the defense
of the town against an expected attack. All the women and children have been
ordered to leave for the interior of Natal.
LONDON, Oct. 4. â The most inter
esting announcement in connec
tion with the Transvaal crisis to
day is that the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, Kight Plon. Sir Mich
ael Hicks-Beach, lias already sanc
tioned the provisional expenditure of
Â£3.000,000, and that the Government
will not exceed that limit without au
thority from Parliament, which will be
asked to vote a cum not exceeding
Â£8,000,000.
A meeting of the War Board to-day
discussed and drew up arrangements to
insure the safety of the route from
Durban to Laings Neck, so that large
bodies of troops may, on disembarka
tion, be rapidly forwarded up the coun
try to the front without confusion or
crowding at the base.
It is stated to-night that the War
Office has decided that the army corps
for service in South Africa shall be
much larger than originally estimated,
and that it now consists of over 40.000
men. The preparations for the dispatch
of this force, including the chartering
of big ocean liners, is steadily and sat
isfactorily proceeding.
The Press Association learns that the
dispatch drawn up by the Cabinet on
Friday was still unsent up to this even
ing.
On the other hand, a telegram from
Brussels gives from "a well informed j
source" the news that Dr. Leyds, the |
representative in Europe of the South <
African Republic, has received con
firmation of the report that President
Kruger had addressed an ultimatum to
Great* Britain demanding the with- j
drawal of the British forces from the
frontier within forty-eight hours, and
that it was delivered on Monday. This
report, however, still lacks official con
firmation.
The confidence of the military au
thorities is shown by a dispatch re
-1 to-night from Cape Town, which
states that at a conference of the mili
tary authorities there and General Sir
Stewart White, V. C, who will com
mand the British forces in Natal, and
Lieutenant General Sir Frederick
Walker, held to consider the situation.
General White expressed himself as
confident that the British would be
able to present a force sufficient to re
pel any attack. General White, who
intended to go to Durban on board a
warship, has now, in order to save
time, abandoned the. idea and will go by
â train to-night.
.A line steamer left Lourenzo Mar
ques, Delagoa Bay, to-day with 1200
Rand refugees. Large numbers were
left behind, and all trains are crowded
with those taking part in the exodus
from the Transvaal.

that the Boer camp on the Natal border
comprises 8000 men and is growing

Prof. Geo. F. Barker, M.D., University of Perm.: "All
the constituents of alum remain (from alum baking powders) in
the bread, and the alum itself is reproduced to all intents and
purposes when the bread is dissolved by the gastric juice in the
process of digestion. I regard the use of alum as highly injurious."
Dr. Alonzo Clark : "A substance (alum) which can de-
range the stomach should not be tolerated in baking powder."
Prof. W. G. Tucker, New York State Chemist: : " I believe
it (alum) to be decidedly injurious when used as a constituent of
food articles."
Prof. S. W. Johnson, Yale College: "I regard their
(alum and soluble alumina salts) introduction into baking pow-
ders as most dangerous to health."
In view of such testimony as this,
every care must be exercised by
the housewife to exclude the over

baking powders from the food.

One of the largest corps lay In the

Commandant General Joubert Is mo

The most sensational news from
South Africa this morning is a reitera
tion of yesterday's report of the ac
quisition by the Transvaal authorities
of Â£500,000 in gold, which was on the
way to Cape Town from Johannesburg.
The confirmation of the story comes
from two sources. The Cape Argus as
serts that the Boers made the seizure
at Vereeningen, the amount being the
week's shipment of gold on the way
from the Rand to Cape Town,
and forwarded the treasure to
Pretoria. The report Is also con
firmed by a cablegram received to
day by a mining company in London
from their representative, which is to
the effect that the train upon which he
was traveling from Johannesburg to
Cape Town was held up and looted by
Boers, who secured Â£300,000 in gold,
the amount being considerably less
th;in the original estimate.
There is a well authenticated report
that a large force of Boers is assembled
at Selik at the junction of the Crocodile
and Pongolo rivers, evidently with the
object of destroying the railway.
A special dispatch from Pretoria says
the Transvaal Government has seized
gold to the value of Â£SOO,OOO. which is
now lodged in the state mint. The
Government, the dispatch adds, will
indemnify the banks to which the gold
is consigned.
The Daily Mail's correspondent at
Lourenzo Marques reports that her
Majesty's ship Philomel has gone to
Durban for the purpose of landing 100
men and a gun. Commenting editor
ially on the foregoing dispatch the
Daily Mail says it considers that the
action reported indicates great dajiger.
"The admiralty," says the Dally Mail,
"would not countenance such a move
ment except in circumstances of un
usual emergency, and thinks it proba
ble that other British warships are
converging silently upon the theater of
action.
The Daily Chronicle's correspondent
at Cape Town, telegraphing under date
of Tuesday, says: "For the first time

talk with General Joubert in the truin.
He said he deeply regretted the im
pending war, which he had done his ut
most to avoid. He wonders that Queen
Victoria never answered the letter he
addressed to her on the situation.
"I notice everywhere a general devo
tion to the Queen and a pathetic belief
that she will stop the war. General
Joubert still believes in a South African
confederacy under an English protso
torate and attributes the present crisis
to Cecil Rhodes and Mr. Chamberlain.
His last words to me were: "I leave it
now to God. It may be his will that the
Transvaal shall perish. 1 can only do
my part.'
"The general was enthusiastically
welcomed at the Boer camp. The Boer's
are undisciplined and unorganized and
their ambulance arrangements are very
defective; but the commissariat is fair
ly good. A majority of the Boers are
unwilling to fight, but are quietly con
fident. They will overrun Natal, attack
ing it from both sides in the neighbor
hood of lngogo or Lady Smith.
â¢"The Boers are much afraid of lyd
dite shells and dumdum bullets. All the
untrained men are mounted. They
maintain a high reputation for shoot
ing. They have no uniform. All com
plain bitterly of being compelled to
leave their wives and children and
farms at the mercy of the Kaffirs.
There is much confusion in the camp.
Heavy rains have deluged the lands
and blocked the roads, and horses, oxen
and tents are mixed up together. The
men are seen arguing with their offi
cers, but there is no excitement or
loose firing. It is difficult to say ex
actly, but 1 suppose there are 6000 men
in the Rand River laager and others
are continuing to arrive. The horses
are in excellent condition. I only saw

which is stationed at Majuba Hill. But
I am allowed to telegraph information
as to the movements of English troops.
The Boers deprecate the peneral panic
among the English in the Transvaal as
if they were savages. They have con
structed a few earthworks to defend the
railway and hold a good technical posi

lack of locomotives and the difficulty of

SKELETON IS
NOT DUNHAM'S
Seen in Salinas After
the Murders.
â¢
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Oct. 4.â Sheriff T,angford
is satisfied that the bones discovered
in the Pacheco hills by Cyclist Fred
Keener were not Dunham's, but that
the sextuple murderer of the McGlincy
family got safely out of Santa Clara
County.
Several months ago a report was pub
lished that a Mrs. Bushnell, living in
the remote hills of Monterey County,
had seen Dunham about a week after
the murders. This has been verified by
Sheriff Keefe of Monterey County, who
called on Sheriff Langford to-day. Mrs.
Bushnell lives on Arroyo Seco, in the
coast range, between Soledad and
Paraiso Springs. It is a remote sec
tion and for weeks at a time the fam
ily is without outside communication.
She knew Dunham for several years.
He had hunted in the section and
stopped at her house. Shortly after the
murders he showed up at her house. He I
had a gun with him and was apparently I
on a hunting trip. His conversation
was rational and this completely upsets
the theory that he was crazy. Dunham
stayed at the house all day and all
night and left the next morning without
mentioning destination. Several weeks
after Mrs. Bushnell heard of the mur
ders. ;â '/*â ; â¢â 'â ;
Mrs. Bushnell Is highly respected and
stands high in the community, and
both Sheriffs I.anpford and Keefe are
convinced that her statement is correct.

Jute Mill Closed.
SAN QUENTIN PRISON. Oct. 4â The
main shaft in the jute mill broke yester
day afternoon, necessitating the closing
down of the mill for a week. The accident
at this time is singxfarly unfortunate on
account of the large number of orders
filed for grain bags. The break occurred
at the same point during Mr. Halt's in

crystallization of the shaft.
