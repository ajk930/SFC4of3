HOW THE WAR WILL
AFFECT POLITICS
WASHINGTON, July 31.â Senator j
Burrows of Michigan in an interview
with a Post reporter this afternoon
said:
It is my judgment that if the war in ]
the Philippines is still in progress next :
year and the end is not thru In sight the j
situation will be to the disadvantage of j
the Republican party. The only hope for;
the party and the country, I might add, i
Is In a speedy change of conditions In the j
Philippines: Unless the war in the Phil- j
ippfnes speedily ends it. will become an !
important political fa. tor. and its <*on- t

the East without the sacrifice of life and
money. I believe in finding new markets j
for our people. We are the greatest pro- >
dui-ers the worlel has known, and the
Orient doubtless offers us a great ippor- j
tunity. No inne yet knows what .sibili- j
ties are. to be afforded lev China, which
sterns now to he iggering to her fate.
If there- is to be a great development in
that direction I certainly want th- United j
States to have a share. At the same time
we must not e.verlook the fact that we
may run counter at any moment to Eng- j
land: France or Germany.,' and I believe
that England, now apparently so friendly.
will strike at us the moment we cross her
threshold. More- than .hi--. 1 say frankly ,
That if our participation in the '. stern
trade is to be purchase at the cost of
an indefinite war in the Philippines; we

The. President is acting wisely, in ray ;
opinion, in endeavoring to restore peace ;
and order in the Philippines hy sending
an increased army to assist Oeneral Otis. .
It is to he -sincerely hoped that fresh i
troops will he able to establish the au
thority of the I'nited States. We must I
remember, however, that although we j
have now been lighting some time ;
we have oonejuereel a territory only about
â¢fifty miles to the north of Manila and
fifteen miles t.o the south, a mere baga- I
telle compared with the immense area I
e.f the archipelago. If the additional

December some definite information upon j
which to act. For the present. 1 hope the |
President will continue in his effort to:
end the trouble and that his efforts will!
be crowned with success. Victory for j

! â
Special Dispatch to The Call. . ' ,
ORTIZ, July 30.âAny doubt that the
Yaquis are on the â¢ warpath in deadly
earnest was dispelled when a courier
arrived to-day with news of the killing
of several Americans and Mexicans at
points In the central and lower Yaqui
valleys. The courier says the Indians
are waging a bloody war upon all set
tlers and that he has positive evidence,
of the slaughter. J. F. Remley. a mer
chant of Hermosillo, and E. Miller, a
photographer in his employ, both
Americans who were traveling through
the small settlements in the valley, are
among the killed.
The victims were surprised and shot
down without quarter. The entire coun
tryside is in terror and people are flee
ing from pueblos and mining camps to
the settlements. It is estimated that
from 2000 to 3000 Indians are in arms.
This does not represent their total
fighting strength, however, for several
thousand are working in the larger
towns, and these send their earnings to
the braves in the field and thus furnish
sinews erf -war.'
The outbreak is a surprise to General
Torres, who subdued the' Yaquis in
May, 1887, after a hard campaign of
more than two years. He was at the
Yaqui capital, Torin, only a few weeks
ago and discovered no indications that
the hatchet was being dug up. The
general is now in the field with the
Twelfth regiment, and other troops are
being mobilized as rapidly as possible.
Colonel Kosterlitzky, formerly of the
United States army, is gathering troops
at Magdalena. 220 miles from the scene
of trouble, and will reinforce General
Torres. A battle is expected in a few
days. ;'.}Â»-* 'â ?'
It is impossible to estimate as yet the
number of whites killed, inasmuch as
the- Indians are devastating a wide
stretch of country. .
At the signing of the treaty of Tin
two and a half years ago General
Torres told the. Yaquis that another
outbreak would mean a war of exter
mination. Torres was in earnest and a
bloody reckoning may be expected.
FROM TRANSPORT TO CAMP
THROUGH CHEERING CROWDS
Royal Welcome for the Men From Utah and Nebraska
Returning From Manila.
Cheers and Flags and Tooting Whistles Mark the Progress of the
7 ' Volunteers to Their Last Military Home at
the Presidio.
f --jHERK were more flags, more
7 "; cheers, more whistles and more
- enthusiasm yesterday as the
1 Nebraska men and the Utah
men marched up Market street
on their way to the Presidio. There
were thousands of welcomers on the
wharf and 'there were thousands more
along the "line of the parade. There
was a whistle going wherever there
was a factory or an engine of any
kind. and _ the steam blown away in
adding to tire din would carry the sol
diers back again to Manila, did they
wish to go.
The troop? left the transport at â¢ 9
o'clock and?"- formed on the- dock,- the
regiment in front and the two batteries
of artillery in the rear. The escort
sent from the Presidio formed on East
street and waited for the word. When
it came .-arid the newcomers marched
out of the dock those around the en
trance gave a ringing cheer and it was
taken up and whirled along the. water
front by the lines of watchers. until the
steamboats and factories joined in the
chorus to swell the boisterous greeting.
Down East street to Market, out Mar
ket to Golden Gate avenue then to Van
Ness and then out Lombard to the
camp the men passed through almost
unbroken lines of people, and every one
was cheering and every second one had
a flag which he waved vigorously upon
the least occasion. The ladies of the
Red Cross Society were at the wharf,
and they gave each man a bunch of
flowers to decorate rifle or hat or
blouse or haversack.
The battle flags were there, too, and
their progress up the street could be
followed by the renewed outbursts from
the crowds as they caught sight of their
tattered folds. The regimental flag of
the Nebraskans is little more than' a
shred and their national colors are
worse; the guidons of the Utah bat
teries are torn to ribbons, and the col
ors in all of them are faded and dim.
But the men are 'very proud of them
and they will hold the place of honor
among the treasures of the States from
which they came.
The mascot of the Utah batteries
marched with his comrades, proudly
bearing the silver cup the batterymen
had won on the baseball field at Ma
nila. There was a tournament held by
teams from six of the regiments and
the Utah men won the trophy. The
mascot is Robert Donohue. a lad of
twelve years of age, who has been With
the batteries since they left home a
year ago. "He was in three battles with
the troops, one at .San Fernando and
two at the waterworks, but he came
out of them all unscathed. .../ ;^i
The part of the parade that created
the greatest sensation was the line of |
ambulances carrying the men who
were not able to stand the long walk
from the wharf to the Presidio. There
Were ten of them, all filled with pale,
emaciated soldiers, some with crutches
beside them, some with heads band
aged, some with their arms in slings
and all showing plainly in look and at
titude what the island war is costing.
The sick men were cheered to the echo,
and they livened up and cheered back.
Men shouted words of encouragement
to them and women broke past the po
lice and threw* flowers into the ambu
lances, and all along the line the course
of the hospital wagons was. one of tri
umph.
[ At the corner of Van Ness avenue
and Bush street the troops were re
viewed by General Shafter and Gover
nor Poynter of Nebraska, ' and then
after reaching the Presidio they were
drawn up in line on the inner parade
ground and the Governor addressed
them briefly and gave them greeting.
He referred to their brilliant work and
their uncomplaining obedience and he
ended by' declaring that Nebraska was
proud of her sons.
The troops were reviewed once more
Governor Poynter, Adjutant General
.Barry of Nebraska and Adjutant Gen
eral Charles S. Burton of Utah. The
Utah men lined up with the Nebraska
men" and marched past the reviewing
officers with them. -v7^ ;-.V" :
The men .were then marched at once
out to the camp where as quickly as
'possible. they were assigned to quarters
and the work of preparing dinner was
commenced. They marched up from i
the transport in heavy marching order
with this exceptionâ the Utah men had
no arms. They left their guns and re
volvers In the Philippines with the men
of the Third Artillery, and they car
ried only their blankets and haver
sacks. Each man had one meal in his
haversack to guard against letting the
men go hungry should anything delay
the commissary department, but there
was no delay except from the late ar
rival of the troops and before 1 o'clock
the mess call was sounding merrily
down the company streets.
Ths Nebraska Regiment has been as
signed to the tents adjoining those of
the Oregon Regiment and the Utah
men have been put on the hill over
looking the camp on the old parade
ground. They were not long in settling
; themselves in their new quarters, and

by the middle of the afternoon the camp
was in fairly good running order, lines
of men were coming and going to and
from the straw pile and there were few
who did not sleep last night upon a
well-filled mattress.
So far no programme for the govern
ment of the troops has been outlined,
but it is certain that they will be given
the fullest liberty. There was a small
guard set yesterday afternoon, but it
had not much in the way of duty to
perform. To-day the men will be told
what they can do and what is forbid
den.
The work of mustering out the men
from the Hancock will take three weeks
anyway. The Utah batteries may be
finished inside of two weeks, for on the
way over Major Grant had his officers
prepare most, of the necessary papers
and they are ready for the mustering
officer now. Besides there will be very
little in the way of ; a property settle
ment in the case of the batteries, for
they left most of their property with
the military establishment in Manila.
Every one of the men is loud in his
praise of the way in \ which they have
been received and loudest of them all
is Governor Poynter. He is going back
to Nebraska probably this evening and
he declares he will make a most flatter
ing report of the .homecoming of the
regiment when he gets there. "I will
say to the people of Nebraska," he said
yesterday, "that the men could not
have been more heartily welcomed had
they belonged to this city instead of
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
back in Nebraska. It was the greatest
welcome I have ever seen and we are
all grateful. I will say at home that
the regiment is well and that the men
are bearing modestly the fame they
have won. As for myself, I have none
but the kindest thoughts of San Fran
cisco. I have been shown every cour
tesy by the city officials, by the army
officers and by the business men. I
have been given every assistance I
could need and I shall always be grate
ful for the way in which our beloved
regiment and myself have been received
by the people here."
Adjutant General Burton of Utah ar
rived Sunday evening. He came to be
on hand when the batteries landed and
to consult with Major Grant on how to
get the men home. "We will not let the
batteries be scattered," said he yester
day. "Our boys have done too well to
allow them to break away from each
other now. We will bring them home
together and we will give them a recep
tion at Salt Lake that they will long
remember."
All the men who came in Saturday
night have been provided with warm
clothing. The Nebraska men. in addi
tion to heavy underclothes which they
drew while on their way here, will be
furnished with a chest protector apiece,
the chest protectors having been sent
out from home by their own State.
The Utah men have also drawn heavy
clothing, so there will be no increase of
the sick list from cold or exposure.
Every tent has a stove and there is
plenty of coal, every men has a good
blanket and a straw mattress can be
had for the filling of it: there is plenty
to eat and there is nothing to do but
rest, so the life of the troops from now
until they start East should have but
the one careâ to see their native States
The Nebraska boys owned the Orph
eum last evening and will continue in
control to-night and to-morrow night.
Owing to the exertions of the citizens'
executive committee the entire regi
ment will see the splendid entertain
ment provided at this popular house.
Yesterday afternoon a representative
of the citizen?' executive committee
i and a representative of the Orpheum
went out to the Presidio and presented
Colonel Mulford with 469 tickets for
last night's performance. Of these
nineteen were for the officers and 350
were distributed among the men of the
regiment and 100 among the members
of the Utah Battery. This afternoon
i 454 tickets will be distributed among
the soldiers and to-morrow night all
who have not seen the performance will,
be made welcome.
The soldiers thoroughly enjoyed the
programme last- night and there were
so many encores that it was late before
the last number was given. A section
in the center of the house had been re
served for the men and when a num
ber pleased them a thunder of applause
went up from that quarter that set
everybody else applauding. After their
year's service in Manila a night in the
Orpheum seemed like fairyland to the
war-worn soldier boys. After the en
tertainment they returned to camp sat
isfied that they are really and truly
home again and that there are some
I pleasures left in life after all.

NO ABATEMENT OF
YELLOW FEVER AT
HAMPTON HOME
Disease Probably Brought by a
Santiago Veteran- General
Quarantine in Force.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, July 31.â The latest I
official advices received up to 8 'dock i
to-night show a total of thirty-seven
cases and seven deaths from yellow
fever at the Soldiers' Home at Hamp
, ton, Va. One new case developed at
the home day. Thus far the disease
has been confined to the home, but all â 
surrounding towns are excited and a j
vigorous quarantine is being main- 'â 
tamed. Dr. Wadin of the Marine Hos- j
pital Service is now in charge of af- j
fairs at Hampton and is working in- â 
co-operation with the local Boards of
Health. He has strengthened the cor
don about the town of Phoebus, which ,
he reports is in very bad sanitary con- |
dition. The fact that only one new case j
appeared to-day is encouraging to the \
officials here, who are taking even- j
measure to prevent .1 spread of the :
disease. They feel that the fact that
the affected locality is in the hands of
the Government and under the one |
management will be of great value In
dealing with the scourge and will en- |
able better results to be obtained than j
where the epidemic broke out in com- j
mercial places. Already a number of |
inquiries have been received by Dr.
Wyman from quarantine officers j
througout the United States, asking
whether they shall Impose a maritime
quarantine against Norfolk. He has J
replied that there appears to be no ne- |
cessity for such a restriction in the
case of either Norfolk or Newport
News.
Dr. Wadin's official report of his ex
amination of the existing conditions
at the Soldiers' Home reached Dr. Wy
man to-day. It is dated yesterday and j
notes the fact that the doctor has seen j
all the cases of suspected disease at
the home. He sums up the history of
the contagion as follows:
"Early in July an old soldier entered
the home for a short lest and soon aft- ,
erward appeared at the dispensary, !
where he informed the physician in
charge that he was but recently from
Santiago via transport to a northern
port; thence he started for Manila via
San Francisco; beat his way to the
home on a freight train and entered
with his baggage. He complained of
dumb chills and fever and was pre
scribed for. He mingled freely with \
the inmates of the home and a short j
time ago disappeared. This is regarded j
as a possible use of the outbreak. i
"Preceding Friday, the 21st, there J
had been re. thing of a suspicious na
ture. The weekly death rate was as
f usual. But on the "Ist and 22d there
became ill during the night, with sharp
chills and high fever, some eight or ten ;
inmates, men of usually good health. I
These seizures, although noted as pecu- j
liar, had occasioned no alarm until i
about Thursday, the- 27th, when a death ;
occurred^ the man becoming distinctly]
yellow some time prior to his death. On
or about the same day another died
without having attracted particular at- â 
tention. He Iso turned quite yellow.
Autopsies were held on both by the
resident patologist. It was then, or a';
little later, that the telegram was sent
asking for ar . expert. I found there
were 3600 inmates and that 35 had been
taken ill since the 21st." Dr. Wadin
says he withheld a positive diagnosis j
VICTORY CLAIMED
BY BOTH SIDES
Status of the Cleve-
land Car Strike.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CLEVELAND, July Whether the :
boycott on the Big Consolidated Street j
Railway Company is having any effect or
not, the company shows no indication of
a desire to change its policy with respect
to the strike. A special meeting of the |
directors of the company was held this
afternoon. At Its conclusion President
Henry A. Everett was asked if the strike
had been discussed.
"Incidentally it was." was his reply.
"Is it the Intention of the company to
move for a settlement of the strike?" was
asked. â¢ â¢'.
"No." said President Everett. "We are
going ahead as .we have been going. We
are hiring new men all the time, and we
now have nearly all we want. Some of
the new men arc being discharged when
found to be not the mem we want and
others put in their places. We are satis
fled with the situation, and 1 might say
that the board of directors % has been a
unit from the beginning, and lt is unani
mous in favor of the policy being pur
sued." â .'â¢-
On the other hand, the leaders of the
strike profess to be very much encouraged
by the working of the boycott, -and they
say they must surely win, because, they
declare, the public is with them. The
president of the union has been busy all
day listening to the complaints -of mer
chants and others who claim they have
been boycotted without warrant, and
when he discovers that the person who
"complains is . Innocent of the charge of
having ridden on a Big Consolidated car
he gives notice to union men accordingly.
Secretary Bishop of the State Board of
Arbitration arrived in the city to-day to
look over the situation. He said he was

: FORM AN ALLIANCE
Are Suspicious of the Growth of Im
. perialism in the United
* . . States. _ '..
LONDON, Aug. I.â A dispatch to the
Morning Post from Rome mentions a re
port current there to the effect that the

picious of the United States' absorption
of Cuba, Porto Rico and the Philippines
and the growth of imperialism in Amer

The prime, movers in negotiations are
Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Para

Found Dead in His Cabin.
VISALIA. July 31.â John Q. Owen, an
old man living at Three Rivers, killed
himself with a pistol several days ago.
To-day his body -was found ln the cabin
in which he lived alone.
! in his first communication because of
the assertion of Surgeon Vickey, at the ;
home, that there had been no communi- :
cation of inmates with any Cuban sol
diers returned since last May or early
in June.
With the discovery of the probable
origin of the infection and the two au- '
topsies to-day, there can be no doubt,
he says, about the disease being yellow
fever, and continues: "There has been
a, very tree intercommunication be
tween the inmates and the people of
Phoebus, a public- house * near the,
grounds having been freely visited until |
last night.'' :-) '-: .'-
After .'i cordon had been established
around the Soldiers' Home, neighboring '
cities were warned and advised to hunt
for any inmates of the home, who might ;
be visiting and to keep them under
close observation. Dispatches to this
effect were sent Sunday to Norfolk. j
Portsmouth, Newport News and Rich
mond and the Health Officer at Wash
ington was notified. In Norfolk a house
to house inspection is being made.
Surgeon Vickey, at the home, has been
asked to prepare a list of soldiers who
have departed within a month, with a
view to tracing them.
HAMPTON, July 31.- This usually
tranquil town has been in a state of
feverish excitement to-day since the
discovery of yellow fever at the Sol
diers' Home. ires of people took ad
vantage of the first opportunity to
leave the place. Last -.light a speciai
train left Old Point with fully 300 of the
guests of the hotels.
Business in the town of Phoebus, ad- ;
joining the Soldiers' Home, is suspend
ed. Late this afternoon a self-appointed
guard of fifteen Hamptonians, with
Winchester rifles, vent to the home to
assist in enforcing the quarantine reg
ulations. Chesapeake and Ohio trains
have discontinued their service to the j
city.
NEWPORT NEWS, July 31.â After a j
day of intense excitement over the yel- i
low fever outbreak at the Soldiers' i
Home, Newport. News rests to-night
with a feeling of comparative security.
It is felt now that no loophole has been
left by which the scourge may find its
way to this city.
Newport News has quarantined
against Hampton and Elizabeth City
and county and Warrick County. Thus
this city, which is nearly ten miles
from the infected point, has the ad
vantage of practically a double quaran
tine on land. A tugboat patrols the
river to prevent the evasion of quar
antine restrictions by means of boats.
The danger line ashore is guarded by
an adequate force of special policemen.
The street railway company was pro
hibited this morning from running cars
between Hampton and this city.
Hundreds of people left the. city to
day on account of the scare.
â NORFOLK.. July Fear -of the
spread of yellow. fever to this city and
thence abroad has been largely allayed
by the absolute quarantine against the
three peninsula towns 'adjacent to the
infected spot. A licet "'of seven tugs has
been chartered, to patrol the fourteen
miles of water between Norfolk and the
Soldiers' Home, and the Norfolk River
front is constantly guarded by police
men, while a guard from the navy yard
is stationed at the naval hospital to
prevent the landing of small boats con
taining refugees from the peninsula.
The Old Point hotels are practically de.
serted.
ISLAND GRAIN
FIELDS ABLAZE
Losses by San Joaquin
Farmers.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON. July 31.â Grain fires swept ;
through the harvest-laden fields of the
lowlands this afternoon. Roberts Island
farmers were the losers. Three thousand
acres were threatened and for an hour
anxious watchers observed the efforts be
ing made to save the vast fortunes at
stake. . There was no close telephone com
munication and numbers went to the
Courthouse dome to watch the scene
through glasses.
A dense volume of smoke passed over
the. southern portion of the City shortly
after -2 o'clock, and it was at once sur
mised that the daily conflagration had
started on the islands. The lire burned
for two hours, and during all that time
the farm laborers, reinforced by thresh
ing outfits, worked like men whose lives
were at stake. They plowed around and
beat the flames, and at 4 o'clock were
rewarded by getting the fire under con
trol.
Two hundred acres were burned over
and many thousands threatened. Woods
Bros, are the heaviest losers, over half
of the burned area belonging to them.
; The fire started- from a corner of the
Blossom ranch, three miles from the old
Garwood ferry.
There was also a fire on the island near
Fishermans Camp yesterday, by which
Lane & Thompson are reported to have
lost about 200 acres.
Peat fires are now known to have been
the, cause of all the recent destruction
of grain ;on the islands. The under
ground coal beds are becoming a really
serious consideration, after several years
of slumbering, following the overflowing
lof the lands. Farmers with fine crops
! do not know at what minute a blaze is
going to break out, and some measures
must be taken to quench the peat fire
beds* The farmers are going to flood their
lands where possible, while others will

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY. AUGUST 1, 1399.
STATE PENAL CODE
A BOOK OF ERRORS
Report of the Revision
Commission.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, July 31.â The commis
j sion for. the revision and reform of the
I law, consisting of A. Caminetti and R. N.
i Bulla, to-day submitted to Secretary of
] State Curry volume 3 of the report of the ;
. commission, the volume being the revised
i Penal Code of California. Says the com
' mission's report in part:
I A glance at the law under which the com
mission has acted will soon determine that
â¢ the main reason for its enactment was founded
on the long-felt want of legislators and State,
' count, and other officers generally, as well as
. the judiciary and members of the bar, to ob- ;
tain, not. so much new legislation, as a revis- |
ion and codification of existing laws.
j This want was no doubt based on the indis
! criminate passage of statutes ' rather than ,
amendments to codes on the .subjects contained ,
in the latter since their adoption.
This practice had grown to such an extent
that fully one-third of the political code was
/obsolete; the civil code touching on many sub- :
jects lacked many of the laws affecting them, j
especially a? to corporations; the penal code j
was minus a considerable portion of the penal
enactments in force, and the civil procedure,
though less affected, was also ln need of re
vision.
The only changes adopted were such as were
required in changing a statute standing alone
Into a section, article or chapter, forming a
component part of a codified system on the
subject to which it related, and such as might
be necessary to remove portions thereof which
had been repealed, or were declared unconsti
tutional by the courts. Conflicting provisions
were harmonized, and- existing laws containing
uncertain and Incongruous provisions, which
had been tne subject of consideration by the
Supreme Court, were corrected in accordance ,
with the opinion of that tribunal.
Investigations have been carried on by mem
bers of the commission and material gathered
which would have permitted us to complete
the entire work of the first division by the
first Of October, 1899.
. The civil code was transmitted to the last
Legislature and the Judiciary Committee of the
Assembly, acting upon the recommendation of
a sub-committee appointed to examine said re
port, ordered the first volume introduced as a
bill by the Judiciary Committee.
We have since reviewed the political code,
1 adding thereto the legislation properly forming
i part thereof, and adopted at the last legisla
i tive session, and filed the same June 30 of the
present year. ."*''.
On this day we have filed a supplemental re
port consisting of the revised civil code, con 7
raining the amendments thereto of said session.
The' original of this report was filed November
80, 1898 â  -.-**-"
The commission, in carrying on the work of
revision above mimed, have examined tie exist
ing laws in and out of the codes. This Involved
thousands Of code sections and statutes, ami
the determination of many questions arising
from such investigation.

MUTINY CHARGE
AGAINST A YUKON
STEAMER'S CREW
Brutality of Captain Morine
Causes Trouble That Leads
to Arrests.
DAWSON, July 15, via Seattle,
Wash., July 31.â When . the
steamer Yukoner of the so : called
Galvin Company arrived from
7:7j down the river a few days ago
the entire crew was arrested on a
charge of mutiny or piracy, and, after
a hearing, was held for trial at the Sep
tember term of court. The charge was
brought by Captain Edgar Seymour
Mi nine, against whose tyranny ; during
the long winter while the boat was
frozen in at Russian Mission the crew
mutinied. Among the crew are several
well-known San Franciscans, the of
fice of purser having been . held by
Thomas Cuningham,.who was for many
years chief operator and for some time
superintendent of the Postal Telegraph
at San Francisco.
The Yukoner was purchased by the
Galvin Company . last fall, when the
Mary Ellen Galvin, built by the com
pany, was found to be unequal to the
task i if stemming the Yukon. Men
were to be landed at Nu:ato. where they
expected the Gold Star, which had gone
up the river in advance, to meet the
Yukoner on its return from Dawson
and thence they were to go up the Ko
yokuk. Through some blundering of
the engineer, they say, the Yukoner's
boiler burst when she was near the
Russian Mission,, and there the boat
wintered. ii _ â â¢-'â '"â 
According to the members of. the crew
to a single man. the conduct of the cap
tain was so brutal and overbearing
that the men finally refused to work
and demanded their pay. Mr. Curtain,
one of the officers of the company, pre
vailed upon them not to ieave, for their
desertion meant the destruction of the
boat and cargo. The captain, under
protest finally consented to leave and
delivered up the ship's papers to Cap
tain Larson. Captain Murine and his
wife went ashore and at the first op
portunity in the spring came to Daw
son ahead of the Yukoner, made com
plaint against the crew and the arrest
followed. 7* . _ _', ,

SAMPSON FILES SUIT

WASHINGTON. July 31.-Rear Admiral
William T. Sampson has filed suit in the
Supreme Court of the District libeling the
Spanish vessel Maria Teresa and miscella
neous-stores and supplies captured upon
her and other Spanish vessels. In his bill
he says that he brings the suit in his
own behalf and also in behalf of all the
officers and enlisted -men of the United

naval engagement of Santiago de Cuba
on July 3. 1 SOS . and in captures made sub
sequent thereto. . __ -.

the United States was acting under his
immediate command as commander-in
chief; that Commodore Winfield S. Schley
was the commanding officer- of a division
of the fleet under his orders and Captain
French E. Chad wick was fleet captain, or
chief of staff. He recites the capture of
the Spanish vessels, and says that the
captured property has been or will be sur
veyed, appraised and Inventoried, adding:
"This will show that the ' Teresa, was
worth $700,000 .over and above the cost of

Character of McNaugh-
ton Dissected.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, July 31.â The investigation !
into the charges of immorality, incom
petency and lack of character made
against Professor James McNaughton,
the new principal of the State Normal
School, by a committee of the Alumni
Association commenced before the board
of trustees this morning. The full board
was present Trustees H. C. Brown
(chairman). G. W. Sweigert, R. T. Pierce,
F. J. Short and F. W. Leavitt. and State
Superintendent of Instruction Kirk. Gov
ernor Gage, who is an ex-offlcio member
of the board and is said to have been re
sponsible for McNaughton being made
principal, did not appear.
Attorney J. R. Patton represented Mc-
Naughton. Eli Wright and J. G. Jury,
members . of the Investigating committee
and attorneys, represented the Alumni
Association.
As soon as Chairman Brown announced
all in readiness Eli Wright presented a
supplementary report to the report filed
at the last meeting of the board. It was
a voluminous document, consisting of let
ters received in relation to McNaughton,
and occupied over two hours in reading.
There were letters from business men,
teachers and pupils of Council Bluffs,
Iowa; Mayville, N. D., and Temple, Ariz.
A great many of them related to Mc-
Naughton's record at Council Bluffs and
referred to the charges of immorality and
lack of character made against Mc-
Naughton while he was Superintendent of
Schools there. '_ '"â *;â 'â *Â«
A letter from S. B. Wadsworth, an attor
ney at Council Bluffs, said he firmly be
lieved the charges made against Mc-
Naughton to be true. McNaughton was
incompetent. He loaned money on chattel
securities, and notorious characters called
at the school buildings and McNaughton
took them into the basement and trans
acted business. By loaning money to dis
reputable women he enabled them to con
tinue their immoral practices. There were
other letters of this kind.
The correspondence from Tempe, where
McNaughton last taught, related princi
pally to his incompetency as teacher and
disciplinarian. He was accused of favor
itism, and the charge was made that he
had accepted $20 from a pupil in consid
eration for allowing him to graduate. A
few letters spoke of him as a scholar and
a gentleman. .: _Â,,Â»- i-
Attorney Patton followed in McNaugh
ton's defense. He read a typewritten
statement consisting of 200 pages and
consumed nearly three hours It reflect
ed on the investigating committee of the
alumni to the effect that it was unauthor
ized and did not â¢ represent the Alumni
Associatiqn. Letters were read from
ministers, educators and prominent citi
zens giving McNaughton a high char
acter arid denouncing the attack on him
as malicious. The action of persons in
Council Bluffs in sending out what were
termed anonymous charges was de
nounced as worse than highway robbery,
as it was an attempt under cover to rob
Professor McNaughton of his good repu
tation. _ â â¢.-"â¢â  '-:.'." _ . _ 'â 
The animus of the charge against Mc-
Naughton was declared to be the fact
that Superintendent McNaughton waa
Instrumental in the dismissal of a drunk
en and incompetent teacher named Arthur
Stevens. It was claimed the charges were
due to malice and revenge and had no
foundation in fact, and Professor Mc-
Naughton. had been given no opportunity
to deny them. Ministers of all the
churches of Council Bluffs had testified
to McNaughton's good character.
Resolutions from the trustees of the
Mayville (N. D.) Normal were read, de
claring that after an investigation they
were satisfied the charges made at
Council Bluffs were not true.
Attorney Jury argued for thirty
minutes. He urged the necessity of the
dismissal of Professor McNaughton. A
man of his character would drag down
the school, even if his innocence were
proved. â¢-.-''â .'.â¢'
The investigation will be resumed in the
morning, when Attorney Patton will
close f-Â«r the defense. The case will then
be submitted to the board, which will
probably take it under advisement.
The normal trustees met this evening
and reinstated Miss Cornelia Walker on
the petition of a large number of citizens.
At the annual election she was dropped.
Her position will be assigned by the presi
dent. The resignation of Miss Louise '
Maitland as teacher of drawing was ac- I
cepted. _______________ â

DU PATY DE CLAM
REGAINS LIBERTY
Sruguiere to Counter
sign His Acquittal.
â â¦ â
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, July 31.â !.â - Soir announces
that Colonel Dv Paty de Clam was
liberated at 3 o'clock this afternoon.
He immediately drove to his home and
retired to bed, alleging excessive fa
tigue. He declined to see anybody.
General Bruguiere, Military Governor
of Paris, has the power to override the
decision that there is no case against
Colonel Dv Paty de Clam, but it is un
derstood that he will countersign the
acquittal.
Nothing Is yet known of the actual
grounds of the acquittal, but it is re
ported that Dv Paty de Clam was ex
onerated because it was proved that he
acted under direct orders from Gen
erals Gonz and De Boisdeffre, against
whom severe disciplinary measures are
imminent. If this is confirmed it will
prove that the efforts of tie- general
staff to make General Dv Paty de Clam
a scapegoat have failed.
General Roget and Major Culgnet,
who were tie chief witnesses against
Dreyfus in the proceedings in the Court
of Cassation, each maintains that he
has absolute proof of Dv Paty de
Clam's forgeries and intrigues. If
their statements, which it was believed
at the time were made to shield the
general staff, are discredited, nothing
will remain against Dreyfus.
RENNES, July 31.â Already the
crowds that gather daily about the
home of Mme. Dreyfus and the prison
! whore her husband is confined, as she
passes from one to the other, have be
come so augmented as to demand a
material increase in the force policing
the route. Gendarmes therefore have
been placed at close Intervals along the
entire distance from the Rue de Cha
tillon. where Mme. Dreyfus resides, to
the prison, In the Rue dv Hamel. Strict
orders have been issued to prevent per
sons passing from the Rue dv Hamel to
the prison precincts. This has resulted
in a number of conflicts with the
gendarmes, none of which, however,
has been serious.

MYSTERIOUS NO
LONGER IS THE
HERRIN GUEST
Reason of Steele's
Visit Here.
At last the presence of the mysterious
Steele at the Palace Hotel is explained.
Mr. Steele, who Is a member of Seward,
Guthrie & Steele, one of the leading law
firms of New York, arrived here a few
days ago under circumstances which
caused not a little comment. He was
brought here by Attorney Herrin of the
Southern Pacific, who journeyed to. Den- I
ver in a private car for the purpose of j
meeting and escorting his distinguished j
guest. Upon the arrival in this city Mr. ,
Steele was assigned to rooms in tin- Pal
ace Hotel without having to go through
the formality of putting his name on the
hotel books. He brought a stenographer
with him, who was kept busy until all
hours of the night. He denied himself to
reporters. Mr. Herrin professed to be en
tirely ignorant of his identity, and alto
gether the whole affair savored of in
trigue and romance and gave its chief
actor a character that would have stood
for his being anything from a foreign po
tentate to a domestic train robber.
The fact of the matter . is that Mr.
Steele's' presence here was for the purpose
of consulting with Herrin and arranging
the details of the big deal which is fully
explained in the following dispatch from
Salt Lake:

REV. J. C. LYNN OF
SAN JOSE RESIGNS
The Weil-Known Divine Leaves the
United Presbyterian Church for
a Larger Field.
At a called meeting of the San Fran
cisco Presbytery at San Jose yesterday
the Rev. John C. Lynn, for the past three
years pastor of the United Presbyterian
Church of San Jose, tendered his resig
nation.
This course was made necessary by rea
son of the action of the committee on
i Home Missions, which met at Philadel
phia. Pa., in May last. For the past
twenty-four years the Home Mission
Board has supported ln part the San Jose
Church, but this year it failed to grant it
: any aid. thus leaving the pastor without
j a living salary.
The Rev. Mr. Lynn has rendered faith
-1 ful service and his work has been cmi
i nently successful. The action of the board
is not for the purpose of dismissing Dr.
Lynn, but to stimulate the church to self
\ support. Dr. Lynn will either go East,
'. where several calls await him, or take up
â  the work at Agenda, a new and flourish
j ing mission near Salinas.

WASHINGTON AWAITS
THE SAMOAN TREATY
Meanwhile Every One, Including Officials, Is Marveling
Over the Call's Great Scoop.
NEW YORK, July 31.â The Call's great scoop on the Samoan treaty
was all the talk of the town on Park Row last night, or rather
early this morning. The correspondents, who sit up for early
morning papers, discussed this scoop and speculated on the way
The Call managed to secure the big piece of exclusive news. All of the
morning papers reprinted the treaty and the report Of the commission,
and all gave credit to The. Call except the Journal. This paper put a big
head over the news, and printed it in full under San Francisco date, and
introduced the dispatch by saying "The Samoan treaty was received
here to-day," but . never a word about The Call.
In the Herald office, the big scoop was generally discussed and the
enterprise of The Call was highly commended.
The Call's correspondent at Washington sends the following:
"The newspapers, have scored a scoop on the department," said Sec
retary Hay to-day, when asked for an expression of opinion on the de
tailed report of the Samoan commission published in The Call Sunday
and in other papers this morning. The Secretary playfully indulged in
newspaper slang and at the same time-assured me that he was officially
ignorant of the findings of the commission. He did not attempt to dis
credit the report as published in the morning papers, but he gracefully
declined to discuss the subject or make any comment upon the report of
the commission until an official copy of that document is before him.
The Secretary explained that the administration has the greatest confi
dence in the wisdom, ability and discretion of the members of the com
mission and their recommendations or suggestions will now naturally be
received with full force. He added that the official report arrived in
San Francisco by the same steamer' which brought the published report
and suggested that it may be on its way to Washington by mail.
In diplomatic circles there was but little disposition to comment
upon the report, because few of the responsible legation men are in
Washington at this time. There are some differences of opinion as to the
wisdom of forming a council composed of delegates from each power
with an administrator from a neutral nation.
It is believed by many persons that the problem will not be finally
solved- until either the United States. Great Britain or Germany takes
absolute possession of Samoa. It is contended that friction will continue
so long as the existing three-cornered responsibility prevails.
DEATH OF A ONCE
FAMOUS BEAUTY
Close of the Career of Mrs. Kate
Chase Sprague, Who Was Well

WASHINGTON, July 31.â Mrs.
Kate Chase Sprague, wife of
former Governor Sprague of
Rhode Island and the daugh

i Senator and Chief Justice of the Su-
p reme Court, died at her homestead.
Edgewood, In Washington suburbs,
early this morning. She was 59 years
I old. For three months she had been ill,
l but had consented to medical treatment
i only ten days ago. She grew steadily-
I worse and the end came a few minutes
after 3 o'clock this morning. At the
bedside were her three daughters. Miss
I Kittie Sprague, who lived with her
: mother; Miss Portia Sprague of Nar

and virtuous, and on which she herself in

man almost as prominent and as much

grounds for suspicion as to her wifely

her shrine and many were the hearts and

the offer of Senator Sprague. and their

the two. Then the flight of Roscoe Conk- :
ling from the home before the muzzle of
her husband's pistol, and then the flight
of the wife herself.
After her divorce, Mrs. Sprague retired
to Edgewood, the country home of Chief
Justice Chase, on the outskirts of Wash- j
ington, not far from the Soldiers' Home,
where he died, and where she also
breathed her last. It was an old place,
bought in 1869 from Thomas Magruder, |
who built it many years before."
Here, though nominally retired from so
ciety, she became the center of a nota
ble circle. Roscoe Conkling was a fre
quent visitor, and President Grant. Phil '
Sheridan. Senator Sherman and others
also went to talk of old times and dis- |
cuss affairs of the clay.
The payment of the mortgage on the
place, which was about to be foreclosed,
and the settling of an allowance of $3000
a year on her by her father's and her own
friends put an end to the financial ruin
that had long threatened her; and with
her two daughters she set herself to work, |
with a determination in keeping with the
high spirit and independence of character
that had always been one of her most not

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. WELLING
TON HOTEL. WASHINGTON, July 31.
From commander to rear-admiral in less
than six months is the remarkably quick
jump made by James Entwlstle, chief en
gineer cf Admiral Dewey's fleet, as a re
j sult of the action just taken by the Navy
| Department in ordering his retirement,
; with the rank and three-quarters sea pay
|of his next highest grade. By the oper
| ation of the navy personnel law Rear Ad
i miral Entwlstle was transferred to the
! line of the navy with the rank of cap
! tain. By a provision of the same law of
j ficers who served in the war of the re
bellion are entitled to retire with the rank
lof the next highest grade. The grade of
I commodore having been abolished by the
â¢same law, rear admiral is the next highest
I grade to that which Entwlstle obtained
;by his transfer to the line. Hence his pro
i motion to the rank of rear admiral.
Entwlstle was in the navy during the
Civil War and has served Uncle Sam on
the seas ever since. When the war was
declared with Spain he had risen to be
fleet engineer with Dewey's squadron. He
was on the Olympia at the admiral's side
, during the battle, and his promptitude
: was such that he was complimented after
-1 ward by Dewey. The great commander
I declared, too. that the faultless condition
of the machinery throughout the fleet
and the excellent management of Entwls
tle were largely responsible for the wip
! ing out of the Spaniards.
Admiral Dewey furthermore referred In
i a very complimentary manner to Entwls
â¢! tie in a speech which he made in Aus
: tria. He must have spoken at headquar
ters as well, for it was not long after
the great battle that a commission as
captain arrived for Entwlstle.
Captain Entwistle was near the ago
limit and was sent to his home in Pater

standpoint. He maybe a moral and a men-
tal giant, but the flesh of ill-health is weak,
and he is probably a physical coward. It is
not in nature for a sickly man to be a brave
man. His spirit may be willing but his
body is weak. That is the man's own fault.
Any man can be healthy who will pay a lit-
tle common sense a^.f-ntion to his health
when he has it, and when he gets a little
out of sorts, take the right remedy. Many
of the diseases that afflict mankind are
traceable directly to indigestion, torpidity
of the liver and impurities in the blood.
Dr. Pierces Golden Medical Discovery is
the greatest medicine for disorders of this
nature. It strengthens a weak stomach,
corrects all disorders of the digestion, gives
edge to the appetite, invigorates the liver,
purifies and enriches the blood and tones
up and invigorates the nerves. It searches
out disease germs, kills them and carries
them out of the system. It is the great
blood-maker, flesh-builder and nerve-tonic
and restorative. It makes strong, healthy
men out of weak, sickly invalids. Medi-
cine dealers sell it and no honest dealer will
urge a substitute upon you.

" The medicine certainly worked like a charm

THE ABBOTT FIRST
IN STRAIGHT HEATS
Easily Wins the 2:08 Trot on the
Opening Day of the Columbus
Meeting.
COLUMBUS. Ohio. July 31.â The Grand
Circuit meeting opened to-day under the
Biost favorable conditions. The weather
was clear and the track fast, though it
will improve considerably with continued
fair weather. There were three races on
the card and, with the exception of the
2:23 pace, they were almost featureless.
The big race of the day was the 2:08
trot, with four startersâ The Abbott,
Eagle Flanagan, Kentucky Union and
Mattle Patterson. The Abbott was almost
a prohibitive favorite, and the bay gelding
did not disappoint his backers, winning in
straight heats. Eagle Flanagan was ex
pected to give The Abbott a brush, but
the favorite won with ease, being crowded
only in the second and third heats. The
Abbott clipped a quarter of a second off
his record in the second heat, when he
went the mile in 2:07%.
In the 2:14 pace Hob Fitzsimmons won in
straight heats, taking the first In the fast
time of 2:07%. There were nine starters In
this race, but Bob Fitzsimmons was al
most a. prohibitive favorite.
The 2:23 pace furnished the only excite
ment of the day. There were seven start
ers. Although Shade On was picked by
many to win. Wandering Jew sold favor
ite in the pools and his backers did not
flinch when Shade On landed the first
heat. Only four horses remained in the
race after the first heat- Wandering Jew,
Shade On, Beauty Spot and Mount Clem
ens Boy. The Jew took the second and
third heats in apparently easy style and
looked a sure winner, but in the fourth
he broke several times and showed evi
dence of weakening, dropping Into fourth
â¢place, while- Shade On took the heat.
When the horses scored for the fifth heat
it was evident that the Jew was out of it.
He nearly fell just after he passed the
wire and trailed far behind the bunch,
being shut out of second money by the
distance flag. There was a sharp brush
between Shade On and Mount Clemens
Boy at the finish, but the former won by
a length under the whip. Results:
t.OS trot, purse.. 19000- The â¢ Abbott won In
straight beats. Time, 2:09%, 2:07*4: 1:07%,

ENFORCING AN ORDINANCE

Redwood City Residents Spend a
Day Watching the Bringing
In of the Luckless
Pedalers.
â â â¦
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDWOOD CITY, July Bicycle ;
riders from neighboring counties would do
well to obtain a copy of the ordinance
passed some time ago by the Board ot i
Supervisors of San Mateo County and j
carefully study Its provisions. The or- I
dinance makes it a misdemeanor to ride
at any time without a bell, and at night,
from sunset to sunrise of the following
morning, without a lamp. It is an offense
to ride with the feet off the pedals, gen
erally known as "coasting," or to drag
behind the wheel any bush, stick or other
article.
The ordinance took effect .some time
ago, but the officers were lenient with
riders, refraining from making arrests to I
give wheelmen an opportunity to become
acquainted with Its provisions. Yester- \
day, however, they commenced a crusade I
against bicyclists violating the ordinance,
and as a resull a large number of arrests I
were made. Constable Chatham and his
deputies were busy most of the day run
ning wheelmen Into the Justice's Court.
As a result the treasury of the county la ;
richer and the bicyclists poorer.
As a rule the wheelmen took their ar- :
rest in good part, pleaded guilty, paid
their tines and went on their way. Others :
swore vengeance upon the constable and
court for transacting business on a day j
of rest, but finally followed the example
of the more philosophical and paid their;
fines. One pleaded "Not guilty," demand
ed a trial and put up a $". cash bail. It ls .
understood this one took the boat for Ore- j
gon this morning, forfeiting his bail.
The fines were light and considerable ;
amusement was supplied the townspeople,
who had nothing In particular to do but i
watch the fun. From now on a firm com- !
pliance with the ordinance will be de- ,
manded, and violators cannot expect le- j
niency from the court if convicted.

THE OIL INDUSTRY
RECEIVES A BOOM
AN EXCHANGE IS TO BE ESTAB-
LISHED IN THIS CITY.
A Meeting of Bepresentative Men in
the Palace Hotel Results in the
Starting of a Big
Concern.
A meeting of well-known gentlemen was
held last evening in apartments in the
Palace Hotel for the purpose of forming
an organization that has for its object the
establishment of a permanent oil ex
change In this city.
San Francisco, being the natural mar
ket for the oil production of this State,
it was decided some time ago to place an
exchange founded on the same lines as
those now in operation in Pittsburg, New
York and London.
The exchange will, through a system of
certificates very much the same as those
used in other exchanges, handle the entire
oil business of the State, thus greatly fa
cilitating the growth of the Industry and
affording great assistance to both the
buyer and the seller. All data and infor
mation pertaining to oil will be collected
and filed away for the reference and in
formation of those interested. As the.
business increases stocks will be listed
and a call board established which will
provide for a president, vice president,
treasurer, secretary and chairman and
the oil business of this State will assume
the same Importance as the wheat pit or
the mining exchange.
Tho meeting last night was only for the
purpose of getting those interested in the
enterprise together and effecting a tem
porary organization which, it Is expect
ed, will be merged Into a permanent one
somewhere about the Ist of next Septem
ber. To conduct the business of the tem
porary association the following officers
were elected: Wendell Easton, president;
Henry Crocker, treasurer; Emil E. Kahn,
secretary. ">-:.'
The association, which is an entirely
voluntary one and unincorporated, is lim
ited to fifty members, of whom the follow
ing were present to affix their names to
the by-laws: Wendell Easton, Henry J.
Crocker, Emll E. Kahn, August Water
man, Werner Stauf, R. H. Herron. E.

DOXEY IS ON
TOE VERGE OF
BANKRUPTCY
May Be Declared an
Insolvent To-Day.
â¦ â
VICTIM OF KEEN COMPETITION
â â¢ â
HE IS UNABLE TO MEET LIABILI
TIES NOW DUE.
1,
For the Past Week the Bookseller Has
Been Trying to Realize Money
by Selling His Books at
a Low Figure.
â¢*: â
William Doxey, the well-known book
seller and publisher, Is again in a state
of financial embarrassment, and in all
probability he will to-day petition to be
declared insolvent.
For the past week Doxey has been in
dustriously getting rid of his magnificent
stock of literary works at low figures,
and there are now many empty book
shelves in his spacious store under the
Palace. 7,. 7 7
Doxey's financial troubles were first
aired last January, and at that time his
creditors held a meeting and generously
decided to allow him to continue business,
it being agreed that he should meet some
of his liabilities at that time and others
to-day. This settlement for liabilities
amounting to $48,300 was made on a basis
of 30 cents on the dollar, 15 per cent of
the total amount being due to-day and the
balance six months hence.
Mr, Doxey states that keen competition
is mainly responsible for his financial
ruin. "Selling books at a 20 per cent dis
count will ruin anybody," said Mr. Doxey
to a CaU reporter last night. "Ever since
I first was forced to have an understand
ing with my creditors business has been
unusually bad. I have struggled hard to
keep my It ad above water, and I found
it a rather hard task. The sale which
has been in progress here for the last
week has brought in little money. I
thought that I might be able to realize
quite a sum, but I had to let the books go
at a sacrifice. The money market is dull
and the people haven't got any money.
"I will decide to-morrow what my fu
ture course will be. Whether or not I will
to-morrow petition to be declared insol
vent I am not prepared to say to-night.
I will have reached a conclusion by morn
ing."
Deep concern is felt for Mr. Doxey un
fortunate predicament. He has been one
of the landmarks of the local business
world and has hosts of sympathizers In
commercial circles.
MONEY FOR TEACHERS.
Funds Will Be Divided Between Them
and the Merchants.
As a result of the decision rendered by '
Judge Hebbard last Friday that the Mis
sion High School fund was not a separ- '
ate special fund, and could be used for i
general school purposes, teachers and
merchants who had claims under the old
board will divide about $25,000 between
them. Attorney Frank Powers, represent
ing the merchant creditors, yesterday
filed with Auditor Wells a claim for that
amount, but the Auditor Bays there is not
that much in the fund, and that there i
are teachers as well as merchants whose |
claims are upon the fund, and that he ,
will act accordingly.
Weekly Ministers' Meetings.
Rev. J. N. Beard, a delegate to the Ep
worth League convention at Indianapolis,
delivered an interesting, talk before- the j
members of the Methodist Ministers'
Union yesterday on his trip East and .
about the convention. Rev. W. S. Gilbert,
chaplain of the Second Oregon Regiment,
discussed the Philippines before the Pres
byterian Union, and Rev. Dr. Wheat read
a paper before the Congregational minis
ters on "The Prepared Effort to be Made
to Produce Successful Results in Assisting
the Poor." Rev. W. A. Wardell, dean of
McKenzie College, Paulo, Brazil, will
speak to-morrow evening In Calvary
Church in the Interest of the Christian
Endeavor Society. >â¢* Tuesday evening
next a mass meeting will be held in the
Howard Methodist Episcopal Church for
the purpose of appointing a committee to
make suitable arrangements for the com- j
ing of the Epworth Leaguers In 1901.
Catholic Truth Society.
The. monthly religious exercises and lec
ture of the Catholic Truth Society will
be held In St. Mary's Cathedral on next
Wednesday evening, at 8 o'clock. After
the exercises a meeting of the promoters
of the society will be held in the church
basement.

NOT EQUAL TO
THE OCCASION
An Officer Says Many Lives and
Much Money Could Be Saved
in the Philippines.
An officer of one of the volunteer
regiments now in the Philippines
has written the following letter to
the Associated Press:
MANILA. June 27.â The arrival of the:
rainy season firi<ls the insurrection as
bulk. and vigorous as it has been any
time since the outbreak. The insurgent
armies arc well recruited, notwithstand
ing their heavy losses, and are well fed
and clothed. They have profited by their
five months of warfare against the Ameri
cans. They are fast adopting American
tactics ami are becoming better disci
plined and more skillful ln the use of
their weapons every day.
This is the unanimous judgment of the
troops who have been at the front all
through the fighting. The repeated stor
ies sent home about the collapse of the in
surrection are the fanciful dreams of cor
respondents and army officers, who never
venture outside the. walls of Manila.
The American people and the adminis
tration have been too long deceived with
regard to conditions here. Many lives and
millions of dollars will be saved by a
frank understanding of the true state of
affairs, followed by measures adequate to
crush th*- insurrection promptly. One hun
dred thousand soldiers should be here
ready for business by the beginning of the
dry season, in November. Garrisons could
then be stationed at strategic points and
freth troops be available to relieve 'n* s
exhausted columns. Continuous ; blows
would rapidly drive the Insurgents into
corners where I hey might be captured or
starved into submission, but a continuous
warfare cannot he carried on in this ener
vating climate by the same troops. 1- re
fluent reliefs are necessary. Troops should
not be kept here longer than a year. Men
from a northern climate retain their na
tive vigor for six or eight months after
arrival here, and then begin to succumb
to the. various ailments of tropical weath
er. This is exemplified in the case of the
volunteers and those regulars who have
been in the Philippines since last summer.
The most of them arc saturated with ma
laria, many have rheumatism and all are
greatly debilitated. They are unfit for
further duty. ami recuperation seems slow
and unsatisfactory. As it has been with
them so is it likely to be with their suc
cessors. _â -â ' , .
Bui the ope great need in a successful
campaign is a commanding general who
can keep the light going all along the
line at he same "time. It is a great prev
alent belief among the troops now in the
Philippines; regulars as well as volun
teers that General Otis is not equal to
the occasion. He is regarded as being al
together too one-sided, too cranky and too
Blow. Generals Lawton; Mac Arthur,
Wheato'n and Funston are favorites It
is an open secret in many circles that
Gener.ll Otis takes none, of them into his
confidence. Genarl Mac Arthur is the only
one of the four on friendly terms with
General Otis. ._ ,
A mistaken impression seems to obtain
in the United States as to the extent of
the insurrection. The 3,000,000 Tagals are
the leaders in it, but by no means are
thev'a'one. All reports from every island
in the archipelago agree that the Filipinos
everywhere are alike hostile to the Amer
icans although some carry their hostil
ity to greater lengths than others. All
alike have suffered from 300 years of
Spanish oppression and a like cause has
bred a like distrust of the white man. The
10,000,000 million people of the Philippines
are as highly civilized as the 12.000.000
people of Mexico. Their civilization, too.
lias many points of similarity to the Mex
ican, both having been derived from
Spanish sources.
If .j,, American people will Imagine, the
I'nited States to ha-.'- 1 acquired Mexico
agaih-t her will, am! to be engaged in an
attempt to put down a universal rebellion
of the Mexicans with 20,000 troops, they
will have a duplicate picture at close
range of the situation in the Philippines,
with the exception thai the climate of the
Philippines is from 10 to 15 degrees more
tropical than that of Mexico.
The volunteers here were much amused
at the news that the Postmaster General
had forbielder. the circulation of Edward
Atkinson's anti-expansionist documents
through the mails on the ground that
tlkv might create mutiny among the
troop= They accept this explanation as
evidence that the administration looks
upon the soldiers here is a band of chil
dren. The troops are virtually united
against the annexation of the Philippines,
regardless of Edward Atkinson and the
Postmaster-General.

ON AN OIL-TANK CAR
Southern Pacific Hospitality Illus- j
trated to the Disgust of
Sacramentans.
SACRAMENTO, July 81.â number of
mentans are making the air vocal
with complaints respecting the treatment j
they were subj< cted to last night at the j
hands of the Southern Pacific Company. i
A railroad trestle between Sacramento and j
Davis was discovered to be In flames, j
and when the fire had spent its rape fully
500 feet of the long structure had been
consumed. Long delays to trains result
ed. The local train from San Francisco and
two sections each of the Oregon express
and Eastern overland were dispatched to
Sacramento by way of Marysville. Some
of the local passengers for Sacramento
went by wav of Marysville. some walked,
and a number of them took a special train
; Which had been provided for them.
I This train, according to the statement of
Dr. (i c. Simmons, one of the complain-
I ing travelers, consisted of a locomotive
j and an oil-tank car. Men. women and
I children hung on to the car. the cow
-1 catcher, or found a place in the coal-laden
i tender. At 5 minutes before 2 o'clock this
| morning, four hours after the burning
1 trestle was discovered, the weary passen;
i gers were met a half-mile out from Sac
j ramento by an engine and coach.
' jhe delay is credited with having caused
! the passengers great discomfort, while it
i- claimed the ride on an oil car was an
â¢ unnecessary hardship. Blame is attached
to the officials at Oakland, the scene of
| the fire being not a part of the Sacra
i mento division.

business. Before he left the city to-day
he addressed an identical note to each of
the three bureausâ construction, engineer
ing and equipmentâ directing attention to
certain extracts from official letters that
were not proper, and warning the bureau
chiefs that comments similar to those

unnecessary and tended to retard the
transaction of business by provoking re
taliation. ". Â .*, ..

in their communications hereafter all
such criticisms and expressions of judg
ment upon the way in which the duties
of other bureaus are performed and work
done are omitted. They are to confine
themselves to statements 'if opinion per

Special Dispatch to The Call.
ATLANTA, July 31.â Governor Candler
to-night issued an appeal to the people of
Georgia to, join hands and put an end to
mob violence in the State. The Governor !
believes the only way to restore a condi- I
tion of peace and tranquillity and to bring I
an end to. the lawlessness that has been
manifested in different parts of the State j
is for the people to uphold the courts, j
aid them in bringing to speedy "justice all j
criminals, and by the strong force of a
virile public sentiment bring punishment
to lawbreakers of all kinds. The Governor i
tells of the reproaches heaped upon the
State by the repeated outbreaks, and
says:
The purity of the fair mothers and daugh
ters nf Georgia must and shall be preserved,
and at the same time the lives and liberties I
of all the law-abiding: negroes in Georgia muj-t j
and shall be protected. Arson and burglary
anel assassination and robbery and m-sault
must stop, and at the same time lynch law
nice-* stop. The good of both races and the
fair name of the State demand this.
The ordinary processes of the law are amply
sufficient to punish all crimes. Our judges
are pure and incorruptible. Our juries are
composed of our most intelligent, upright men.
who seldom make mistakes. The men often
. makes mistakes and the innocent are made
!to suffer with the guilty. It never knows
whore to stop, but after punishing the guilty.
drunk with the blood of one victim, it thirsts
for the blood of another, and often sacrifice's
. on the altar of vengeance those wlu â  are
guiltless of any crime.
I We must away with the mob. We must f-
I enthrone the law. We must restore the altar
of reason and tear down the altar that pas
i sion has erected. We must do. this in th- in
; terest of the white men of Georgia and in the
Interest of the negroes of Georgia, and lor
I the fair name of Georgia, and to protect the
I virtue of the women of Georgia. Lynch law
I doer- not stop arson, nor murder, nor rob
-1 bery, no- assault. This requires the strong
, power of the statute law. sustained by a
healthy, vigorous public sentiment.
I would appeal to all officers of the State,
civil and military, urging them to remember
that the dignity and the fair name of Georgia
are in their keeping.
I would appeal to them to remember that
: they are the guardian of the peace and happi
i ness of the people of this State. It is their
duty to apprehend and bring to justice all
who violate the law. whether it he the negro
who commits assault or the white man who
i kills him for thÂ» crime. The -rani Juries
. must realize that it is as much their duty to
ferret out and return true bills against mem
bers of the mob who lynch a murderer as It
is to return a true bill against, the murderer
! himself.
I would appeal, especially to the liar, to bring
the potent Influence which the members of the
profession exercise in every community to the
] aid of law and order, not only by discounte
nancing mob rule, but to aid the courts and
I Juries in bringing the accused parties to speedy
i trial. It Is the duty of a lawyer to see that
; his client has a fair and impartial trial, hut
he should not resort to mere technicalities and
! pretexts to defeat the end of justice, or even
t'i delay the enforcement of penalties whereby
j society suffers and the confidence of the people
', in the ability of the courts to punish crime
I is destroyed.
In bringing about this end I would In
| yoke the active, earnest co-operation of all
! good men. white and black, with the officers
: of the law in their efforts to prevent crime,
suppress mob violence and bring criminals t.i
I Justice and to restore' peace and , order and
| tranquillity to all people of every race, class j
I and condition.
ANOTHER DELAY IN
KEETON EXTRADITION
Mexican Government Demands That
All the Papers Be Translated
Into Spanish.
AUSTIN. July 31.â The extradition r.f
] John Keeton still hangs fire. Governor
i Savers to-day received the following let
ter from Judge A. A. Waltham. the United
States extradition agent at El Paso, Tex..
1 who has the matter in charge:
"I am in receipt of the additional pa
! pers sent me in the matter of the extra
, dition of John Keeton. now in jail in the
State of chihuahua. Mexico, and wanted
in the counties of Collin and Sutton for
! the crimes of murder and felonious theft.
"Immediately on receipt of the papers
; I made demand of the Consul here and
; went in person with him to Juarez to see
: the Federal Judge having the matter in
charge. They received the papers, but
, required translation of them into the
! Spanish language. I beg that you advise
me as to how. when and by whom the ex
pense of translation of the extradition pa
: pers and typewriter charges are to be
paid. I find nothing in the treaty which i
; would be construed to cover these cx
i penses. The papers are voluminous, and
much time is required to properly trans
late and prepare for submission.
"Vein will remember that the time of the
i commission of the two offenses by Keeton
I and Dale was prior to the time of the rat-
I ification of the present treaty with Mex
ico, and. as I understand it, it leaves the
matter wholly optional with the Mexican
Government as to whether a surrender
will be made. I learn that the Secretary
of State at Washington has recently de
clined to surrender a fugitive from Mex
ico on the ground that the crime ante
dated the treaty; and it may be. and in
my judgment likely will be, that unless
j a special effort is made through the Fed-
I eral channel the Mexican authorities will
take a similar view of the matter."

Diamond Match Company, marks the final
and formal ending of the -war." which
has. bitterly vexed and troubled stockhold
ers in the Diamond Match Company.

vote passed by the stockholders increas

Match Company, and until three years
ago was also a director of the company.
It is said that Mr. Gould will be given
nearly $1,000,000 In .Diamond Match stock

Boring for Artesian Water.
WOODLAND, July 31.â 1t has long been
the contention of men of experience and
much observation that an abundant flow
of artesian water may be obtained in
Capay Valley by boring to a sufficient
depth. J. -W. Shannon of San Jose owns
a fine orchard near Guinda. He recently
began to bore a well on his premises.
Citizens of Guinda and the surrounding
country decided to experiment and in
duced 'Mr. Shannon to bore deeper than
at first intended, on condition that he be
paid so much a foot after going below the
200-foot level. If artesian water is found
Mr. Shannon is to refund all subscrip
tions. If the. experiment is a failure none
of the subscribers are to have any claim
against Mr. Shannon. The experiment will
be watched with a great deal of interest.

ROCHESTER, N. V.. ' July 31.â
After a vexatious day the trans
continental automobile reached
Rochester at 9:10 o'clock to
night, coming down Main street
lat eighteen miles an hour. Newark
! was left at 8:15 this morning and thÂ«
i run made to Palmyra. The new nuts
on the inlet valves persisted in loosen
ing and falling off. A stop was made
at Palmyra to renew the supply of
| nuts and the trip resumed at 3:30
j o'clock with a new device for holding
the nuts in place. This worked beauti
fully until at Pittsford, when the spin
dle in the rear valve broke, taking the
nuts and causing a delay of two hours
while temporary repairs were made.
The run of eight miles into Rochester
was made in thirty minutes.
The inlet valves will have to he made
still heavier, and we are having the
spindles made five-sixteenths inches in-
' stead of quarter-rind*., as at present.
Everything else is entirely satisfactory
and we will start for Buffalo about 9
I o'clock. The roads are bettor than in
' the East, though on both sides of Fair
port we had heavy roads of sand six
inches or deeper. This and the grades
made the motor work hard, but it was
equal to every call and carried us over
the. worst of the day's run safely. We
had several rickety bridges to cross and
some steep grades. .

here is constantly twitted by French au
tomobolists on the grotesque, picture of
Mr and Mrs. Davis crawling wearily from
village to village in the Empire State, not
1 conspicuous for bad roads, but Americans
1 point with satisfaction to the fact that
. at least the Herald tells where they are.
This is not the case with Comte Oyulai,
j who, the Velo states, left. Vienna on the
14th for Berlin to establish a record. This
Austrian nobleman, who was accompanied
| by M. Antolne de Fahnenfield, not only
' has not yet arrived but no more news is
obtainable of his whereabouts. French
i chaffeurs think some foreign friends
â¢ would do better by telling what they have
i done than what they are going to do.
TWO MEET DEATH IN
THE ELECTRIC CHAIR
Louis Pullerson and Michael McDon
ald Executed in Sing Sing
â¢ fc- Prison. . ,
NEW YORK, July 31.â Louis Pullerson
and Michael McDonald were put to death
by electricity at Sing Sing prison to-day.
Pullerson was taken to the electric chair
at 8-21 o'clock and a current 1720 volts
strong was turned on at 5:22. After fifty
five seconds he was declared to be dead
by the attending physicians.
'McDonald was put to death at 8:42
o'clock, a current of 1710 volts being
turned on at that time and continuing for
sixty-five seconds. McDonald's body re
sisted the electric current more than any
i other man put to death in Sing Sing. It
took ten seconds longer to kill him than
it did Pullerson.
Louis Pullerson. a negro porter, 20 years
old. on March 11. 1898, killed his common
law wife. Kate Smith, a white woman, in
their apartments in New York by stran
l gulation. He said that as the woman had
I been untrue he thought he had a perfect
right to kill her. "
Michael McDonald, a beef carrier, em
ployed in the Eastern Company's slaugh
ter-house in New York, on May 4. IS!'**,
killed Stephen Titus, the head timekeeper.
McDonald, after spending his salary in
drink, demanded several dollars which he
claimed were due him for overtime. Titus
told him to have the sub-timekeeper make
out the bill. McDonald then fired several
shots at Titus.
Anti-Saloonists Victorious.
PALO ALTO. July 31.â The petition of
Nils Johnson to reopen the Little Ven
dome saloon at Mayfleld has been with
drawn from the . Board of Supervisors.
When the petition was first presented
there was much opposition to it, which
culminated in a vigorous protest to the
Supervisors against its being granted.
The protest was signed by President Da
vid Starr Jordan and other members of
the Stanford faculty, and by many of the
property owners of Mayfleld. They ob
jected to' the saloon on account or the
bad influence of the place on some of the
students, and the withdrawal of the peti
tion is virtually a victory for -the forces
which had united against the saloon.

WASHINGTON, July 31.â of the
last official acts of Secretary Alger, who
to-morrow will relinquish his portfolio,
] was to prepare a statement covering sev
eral matters regarding the conduct of the
j war which have been the subject of crit
icism in the public press, particularly with
reference to the appointment of staff of
, fleers in the volunteer army. The state
j ment is as follows:
1 am led to make the following statements
on account of the many criticisms which nave
been made by the public press, especially un
account of a recent article which appeared in
the London Times, containing assertions which
have nee foundation in truth. ,
At the commencement of the war with hpaln,
and for several years prior to that time, th"
regular army consisted of only 25,000 men, with
tic minimum number of officers prescribed by
law. The situation may be partially appre
ciated when it is remembered that within
stxtv days from the declaration of war the
strength of the army was increased to Zio.wn.
and everything for the equipment of Ibis great
force. Including clothing, tents, transportation, >
medical supplies, camps and camp equippage, |
an.i all that pertains to equipping an army for
service had to be manufactured, transported
and distributed for, use.
From the statement referred to, the public :
might be led to believe that the volunteer |
! army was officered by men selected through
political influence with the Secretary 'if War
; by special favor and without any regard to
! fitness for the duties they were to perform. ,
As is well known, the volunteer force, with
the exception of three regiments or* engineers,
: three regiments of cavalry and ten regiments
', of immune infantry, was made up of regi
: ments from the various States, the officers of
I which were all appointed exclusively by the
1 Governors of the respective States from which
I the regiments came, an.l any officer found un
; fitted for service and discharged was replaced
by another in the same manner. The Presi
! dent had no voice or control in the matter.
! The returns of the volunteer army show that
in August, 1898, there were 207.244 enlisted men
i and 8785 officers In those regiments. This, with
: the regular army recruited up to the war
strength, made an aggregate force of about j
275, men and officers. The volunteer officers I
appointed by the President number, all told, I
1032. Of this number 441 were taken from the
regular army and 691 from civil life. The j
scarcity of regimental officers in the regular
service, owing to appointments in the volun
teers, special recruiting and mustering details,
had so reduced their number that to have tak
en a large number for service with the volun
teers would have seriously impaired the ef
ficiency of the regular regiments, For a iittle
over a thousand appointments made by the
President, the number of applications was over
.'...""'i, and each application was aceompantel
by a certificate of his ability and in tr.o-t
instances the military service, either in the
regular army e.r State organizations, and not
infrequently In both. The certificates showed
that each one was as well qualified for the
position he sought and to which he was ap
pointed as could be possible for men In civil
life ln this country. <>f the number appointed
there were, for instance, twenty-six majcr
generals, of which nineteen were taken from
the regular army and seven from civil life. Of
those seven, ail but one were graduates of
West Point Military Academy and all ha.l dis- I
tinguished themselves in command during the
Civil War.
if the brigadier generals there were one hun
dred and two appointedâ sixty-six from the
regular army and thirty-six from civil life.
Those from civil life had all seen service dur
i ing the Civil War or on our Western frontier,
i and all had proved themselves competent to
[ command.
it has been stated and repeated many times
I that the Secretary of War made these appoint-
I ments, when the truth is that very few were
i mad-, upon his recommendation, although he i
caused the entire list, with the recommenda
tions, to be complied and placed before the
President for his selection. I would be only
too glad t.i have had the honor to have made
these appointments. No better, no more loyal
or more patriotic set of men. as a whole, ever
served their count ry. and their appointments
were a credit, not only to the appointing
power but to the country they 'served. There
were exceptions, but that could not have been
foreseen. In every walk in life men are found
who cannot carry out satisfactorily the work
they have undertaken. There were three regi
ments of cavalry, the officers of which were
appointed by the Secretary of War. Colonel
Leonard Wood, now a brigadier "general and
commanding the departments of Santiago and
Puerto Principe, was one of these.. â¢ Colonel
Griggsby and Colonel Torrey. both good offi-
I cers, were the other two. There were three
regiments of engineers, the colonels of which
were all graduates of the Military Academy,
and not only the officers, but the enlisted men,
were selected with a view to their special fit
ness and In most Instances upon the recom
â  mendations of the colonels themselves, and all
! proved themselves most efficient.
'< There were also ten regiments of immune
i Infantry, of whose colonels eight were grad
uates of the Military Academy, who were se
i lf., ted for special fitness to command, and in
i the short time these regiments were in service
i developed remarkable proficiency.
Criticisms as to the amounts and methods of
expenditures which could imply the wrong or
careless use of money were also made by the
London Times. This charge is false. So far
as the conduct of the service was concerned,
no person with any knowledge of the facts can
ever charge truthfully, and no one can ever
! show that a dollar was misappropriated, stolen
or embezzled out of the hundreds of millions
of dollars that were expended. The records are
an i pen book, and 1 will be glad to have them
' rigidly examined, and ask my successor to open
those accounts to the country whenever prop
erly called for in order that the entire truth
may he known. R. A. ALGER,
, Secretary of War.

GIFT OF A MANSION
TO LODGE OF ELKS
Mrs. E. B. Crocker's Beautiful
Sacramento c * m ' 2 Deeded to
the Order.
c SACRAMENTO, July When the members of the local lodge of
5 the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks assemble at their hall to
* morrow night they will be treated to a remarkable surprise. The deed
* will be read to them conveying to the lodge as a gift the magnificent
% mansion of Mrs. E. B. Crocker, situated on the southwest corner of
* Third and O streets, and valued, with its grounds, at $90,000. The docu
Â£ ments were drawn up in San Francisco to-day. the presence of Mrs.
* Crocker in San Francisco with her son-in-law, J. Sloat Fassett, of New
* Yor!* requiring their execution in that city.
T. When The Call is received to-morrow, giving the large majority of
* the Elks in this city the first information of their good fortune, their
$ joy will know no limit. The property referred to is the. old home of E.
X B. Crocker, brother of Charles Crocker, and one of the builders of the
* Central Pacific Railroad. It is connected by a covered passage with the
% Croc 1 -'- Art Gallery, presented some years ago by the widow of Judge
â *â¢ Crocker to the city, and containing some 700 rare works of art.
â T> The residence is one of the best types of the comfortable architec
* ture of a quarter of a century ago. In some respects it resembles the
% present honie of C. P. Huntington on California street. San Francisco,
* being classically plain in exterior design and white in finish. Inside sim
* pie elegance prevails. The mantels are of the most beautiful onyx ever
* quarried, while the walls are adorned with many paintings gathered In
% Europe by the old mansion's former occupants.
* The grounds are wide, terraced, replete with stretches of lawn, and
* abounding in a wealth of semi-tropical plants and flowers. No club
* house in the State is more attractive within or without than the one
* which the munificence of Mrs. E. B. Crocker will enable the local lodge
<!> of Elks to occupy.
% It is understood that the gift is absolute, and that the only require
* ment is that the mansion and grounds shall be kept in good condition.
'''i The ownership will rest with the local lodge, the membership of which is
% fast growing, and in the' highly improbable event of the disbanding of
* the local branch at any future date, the property will go to the national
% organization of Elks, to be used as it. may deem proper.

Not Properly Come Before the
House.
LONDON, July 31.â 1n the. House of
Commons to-day Michael Davitt, Nation
alist, asked what action the Government
of the United States had taken in behalf
of Mrs. Maybrick, the woman now under

her husband; whether petitions had been
received from public bodies and persons
in America, and if the Secretary of State
for Home Affairs. Sir Matthew Ridley,

swered the question, saying representa
tion-* had been made in favor of Mrs.
Maybrick by the United States Govern
ment through the United States -Embas
sador here. Joseph H. Choate, and that
numerous representations had been made
by private individuate. But. he said. It
would be contrary to practice to present
papers dealing with the exercise of the
royal prerogatives.

C eÂ°^u th o, iettv is 9390 feet, and the j
north jetty 8048 feet in length. The sur
fer shows a well-defined channel averag- ,
ing a quarter of a mile in width and -
twenty-four feet in depth at average low

thirty feet of water, which is enough for â¢
the largest vessels or steamboats. In this
great work the Government has expended
over 12,000,000. __

The Democratic hydra, with its two heads and the

either sue reed On the side of the Republican organi
â  zation there is offered a leadership that camps in two
saloons and knows only the politics of swipes. Be

put through the primaries a convention which will
represent the character, the cleanness and the civic
pride of San Francisco. If they constitute and com- l
mission such a convention and with such result, The [
Call will support it.
If the people, however, fail in the duty which they i

owe to their city and then-selves, The Call will still I
stand by their inter* in supporting such individual !
candidates as promise better than the city has had. !
The interests at stake are too vast, the character of i
the city is too important, for a paper independent in j
municipal politics to abandon the people even to the I
consequences of their own neglect. We repeat that I
no self-seeking enemy of puhlic interests shall be
elected on any ticket, if The Call can prevent it by
an independent fig! I against him.
Governor Roosevelt seems to have become a sort
of unofficial Prime Minister to the President, making
and unmaking Secretaries of War, removing and ap
pointing generals and suggesting with superior wis
dom the conduct of the Philippine war. For a disin
terested patriot, who doesn't want to be President,
"Teddy" has a remarkable faculty of keeping his
name before the public.

THE SAMOAN COMMISSION.
THE report to their Governments made by -the
Samoan Commission "and the text of the or
ganic act recommended for government of the
islands has been placed before the three nations con
cerned by The Call. Our first and exclusive publi
cation Of this present conclusion of a matter that but
lately threatened to embroil three great nations in
war "is something more than a stroke of news-getting
enterprise. True, the action of the commission was
world news of first importance, for the time displacing
the Transvaal question and putting the Alaska boun
dary out of news focus, but its publication now re
| moves international friction and gives the people and
the Governments of the United States, Great Britain
: and Germany an opportunity to amply study the sys
tem of government proposed for Samoa long in ad
| vance of the time for action upon it. ; The plan pro- j
; vides a nondescript government, intricate and com- ;
plex, and probably doomed to the fate of that which
it substitutes. Its radical infirmity seems to be that it
casts out entirely all note of the racial and national
characteristics of the Samoans. The kingship is abol
ished; because its existence holds out a prize to the
great chiefs, and its pomp and circumstance are j
dear to the native love of display and ceremonial. |
Abolishing a means of gratifying that inherent love j
of pageantry will not abolish the characteristic which
seeks such expression. It would have been wiser to |
use that trait as a means of guiding and training the l
people into ways of stability than to attempt the sud- !
den destruction of a disposition that inheres in the
native nature. . '
The kingship being abolished, a system of native j
provincial governors is provided for. These are to :
! meet at stated times and compare notes, report on :
the condition of their provinces and suggest adminis
trative features that may be common to all. This
assembly of governors is not given any substantial
power, either administrative, legislative or judicial,
and really amounts to nothing in the scheme. The
provincial governorship itself carries no valuable gov
ernmental function.
The real government is to consist of an administra- |
tor,, chosen from some disinterested power, that is to j
say, he is to be neither American, British nor German. j
He will be assisted by a council of delegates, one rep- j
resenting each of the three powers, America, Great
Britain and Germany, who will also exercise consular |
functions. This part of it amounts to the bestowment
of extraordinary powers upon consuls, who with the
administrator are to form the legislature of the
islands with authority to amend or abolish existing
laws, or to add to the present code. The final judicial
authority is in a chief justice, who is, of course, an
American or European. Petty courts may be set up
by the natives for petty issues and offenses.
Here, then, we have a scheme of governrrient, with
no charter, no bill of rights, no statement of the ele
! ments of personal and property rights and no provi
| sion to prevent their violation. In fine, there has
! been no provision made to protect the rights of the
I weak against the strong. This government is for j
| the natives. Its excuse is the recent outbreak and j
what followed. But upon the head of these dis
! orders the commission say: "The evils may be ;
' grouped under four heads. First, those which appear
i inevitably to attend the election of a king. Second,'
j those which are due to the rivalry of the for
j eign nationalities among themselves, and to their;
i disposition to take part in the native politics, and thus \
'â  increase the importance and bitterness of the dis
: putes which arise. Perhaps the evils which it is least j
! easy to cure are of this class, those which arise from j
j the rivalry and mutual hostility of the different foreign ;
I nationalities. This hostility permeates all depart- j
j ments of life. The traders on one side combine
' again*-! those on the other. The Municipal. Council
; is divided into two parties, each determined to sup- >
'. port its own programme and defeat that of the other.
! Proposed reforms and measures are judged, not on ;
i their merits, but by party considerations."
This is an admission that the troubles of the islands
are due to the presence of foreign traders who take
part in native politics to the creation of disturbance \
and disorder. There is nowhere any serious allegation
against the natives nor their discipline and order. ;
| Yet, for disturbances that are begun and continued by ;
] white foreigners in their rivalry for the profits of com- .
â  merce, the natives are punished by slaughter and the
i ancient form and privileges of their government are ;
taken away! After its statement of the case and of
i the .cause of the recent disorders, the reasonable peo- :
! ple in the three nations in interest would expect to see
: a form of government recommended that would con- j
| trol.the small number of white foreigners who are
: admitted to be the cause of all the trouble. Instead
i of this they are left uncurbed and the natives are
j treated with the greatest severity.
The form of government proposed can hardly
stand. When the executive and legislative powers are
'-. deposited in the same officers there is simply repeated
I a mistake in governmental science that was first per
! petrated,, discovered and abandoned long ago. It will
; no more work in Samoa than it did in the Italian re
| publics, for government is government, whether its
| objects be a few thousand Samoans or many million
Americans, and unless its form square with the
, world's experience it cannot stand.
The expense of sending this commission to Samoa
1 could have been saved by the three powers, for by
: concert of their foreign officers a better scheme could
1 have been devised. The islands are not placated; the
' murderous shelling of villages filled with old women
and children, because Captain Sturdee wanted "some
fun," is not forgotten nor forgiven by the natives, nor
are the followers of Mataafa reconciled to those of
j Malietoa Tanu.
The United States seems to be unnecessarily in
volved in a costly and vexatious partnership with
Great Britain and Germany in the exploiting of that
group of islands -which will never pay for the trouble
of governing them.
The commission expects great results from the con
centration of power in the hands of the administrato**,
and that thereby the evils of a tripartite jurisdiction
will be avoided. But the radical of these evils is left
in the constitution of the council of three, empow
ered to legislate and provide the ordinances which
the administrator must enforce. The latter officer is
a member of that council. Though -he may be a
Swede, Dane, Frenchman, Italian, Russian or Aus
trian, all these powers being disinterested in Samoa,
yet the European interests and contacts of Germany
and Great Britain will inevitably attach him to one
or the other of them. If his attachment be British,
the British and American councilors will join his vote,
make a majority of the council and ignore Germany.
If he join Germany the council will tic and the gov
ernment will be deadlocked.
So the new scheme is not promising of- prolonged
peace in Samoa. The native people have learned that
whatever rights they would retain they must defend.
After being assured by the treaty of Berlin of the right
to elect their own king, and having three times elected
Mataafa only to see him kept out of the office by the
.three nations which were pledged by solemn treaty
to put him in, they will have but little faith in any
treaty promises and international guarantees
THE SAX FEAX'CISCO CALL, TUESDAY, AUGUST 1, 1899.
MORE YELLOW JOURNALISM.
BY dispatches from the East we learn the New
York Journal has published in full the Samoan
Commission report taken from The Call cf
! Sunday morning. In that fact there is nothing ob
jectionable, but the Journal in republishing the news
from our columns acted in accord with its yellow
ness and gave no credit for it. Now stealing is always
reprehensible, and getting the news in that way is
stealing it.
The Journal is at liberty to use the information
which The Call gathers for its readers. It is gratify
ing to know that despite the prominence it gives to
sensational fakes and Creelmanisms, it has enough in
telligence to know legitimate news when seen, and to
know where to look for it when desired. The Call
insists, however, that the yellow sheet shall be honest
in such matters. When it takes news of importance
from The Call it should give The Call credit. It
should not perpetrate the double fraud of stealing
news and then passing it off upon the public as the
product of its own enterprise.
The report of the Samoan Commission is one 'of the
most important diplomatic documents of the year.
In obtaining a copy of it and publishing it in advance
of the time when it will be given out officially, The
Call achieved one of the greatest successes of journal
ism. The report in The Call was copyrighted. The
New York Journal knew it was copyrighted. The
publication therefore was deliberate, and was done
for the purpose of enabling the Journal to parade itself
in New York as a gatherer of legitimate news as well
as a producer of yellow fakes.
That the Journal must get news from some
source outside its own staff is a matter of course.
That the more intelligent journalists in the yellow ser
vice should look to The Call for the needed news is
equally a matter of course. Nor does The Call object
to supplying it. If the Journal asks for it, The Call
will willingly give it, on condition that due acknowl
edgment is made. The objection to the course taken
by the Journal in this case is that the course was that
of a thief who tries to make a reputation for enter
prise by dealing in stolen goods.
MONEY FOR THE GROND RECEPTION.
rROM all classes of citizens there is expected a
prompt and liberal response to the appeal for
contributions to the fund for providing a grand
reception to the California Volunteers now on their
way home from the Philippines. The response should
be liberal because the men, who volunteered to repre
i sent California in upholding the flag of the nation in
' war, merit a glorious manifestation of public honor
, when they return, and it should be prompt because
the time for making preparations is short.
We have with patriotic ardor and hospitable cordial
', ity welcomed the volunteers of our sister States on
their arrival here. That is as it should be, and yet it
is known to all that the true welcome for those heroes
of the war will be given by their kin folks and neigh
' bors when they return to their own homes. The Cali
| fornia boys will have no welcome other than that
which they receive here, and therefore it should be
i made equal to the double welcoming given to the
volunteers of other States.
From every point of view it is desirable the recep
tion of the volunteers should be made one of the most
; notable civic festivals in our history. It should be
: official and it should be popular. It should be accom
panied by every form of public rejoicingâ banners
should fly from every flagstaff, buildings should be
â  decorated, stately parades should mark their tri
; umphal entry into the city and there should be thea
] ter parties, music, feasting and grand receptions.
. To fitly provide such a welcome will require a large
j sum of money to defray the expense. The committee
â  fixes the amount needed at $50,000. With that sum
the reception will be made a festival that will have a
national fame. San Francisco will add to her prestige
;as a hospitable, liberal, patriotic city. It is not too
large a sum to be raised in such a community for such
1 a purpose. The one point of pressing urgency is that
! the contributions should be prompt. The appeal has
I been made. Let the people respond at once.
The London Saturday Review thinks that Canada
is a big enough boy now to shy stones at Uncle Sam,
who is too busy with Cleveland strikes and a Filipino
war to spank the new offender. Nothing but the most
factious British policy can revive, the Review adds,
an annexationist party in Canada. A few opinions
such as the Saturday Review entertains would very
quickly create an aggressive annexationist party in
the United States.
The proselyting ardor of two Mormon elders has
been cooled to the freezing point by a recent affair
in a Florida county, in which the elders figured spec
tacularly as principals. They weiÂ«e stoned and chased
by a mob, their clothes were torn from their backs
and they were forced to swim a swollen river to save
their lives. They have volunteered the information
that they will abandon that field for the present.
The Czar's Peace Conference is at an end. Eng
land is hurrying troops to the Transvaal. Canada has
a chip on her shoulder for Uncle Sam. The Filipinos
are being slaughtered with due diligence. Germany
is reading an insult in every comment and European
birds of prey are hovering over the Chinese empire.
Even the nations enjoy a huge joke on themselves
once in a while.
A Corning editor has been beaten almost into a
pulp by a young man who resented the imputation
that his father had not as clever brains as his partner
possessed. If that young man's mental caliber is
any indication of his father's intellectual weight per
haps the editor was right. t
The Brownsville -woman who gave birth the other
day to seven babies is said to be doing as well as
could be expected. The dispatch is delightfully in
definite in reference to what might be expected under
the circumstances.
Notwithstanding the fact that Sir Robert Peel has
announced his intention of putting all the pictures of
his illustrious family in pawn, London editors are
fatuous enough to think he has "redeeming qualities."

' Spain is still trying to discover why her generals
surrendered in Cuba. Perhaps some of the Ameri
can gunners might throw a little light on the subject.

Chief Lees wants bicycles for the use of the police

The r people of Spain have not only "got on" to
Weyler's caliber, but they know he is a muzzle-loader
for blank cartridges.
Now if the Ko Kos of the Health Department will
only commit official hara-kiri the people will thank
them. :
DOES THE CHRONICLE STEAL ITS NEWS,
OR IS IT A "YELLOW JOURNAL"?
Tn an editorial yesterday the Chronicle writhed in spasms of indignation over what lt was pleased, un
grammatically, to characterize as the "evils of yellow journalism," "fake interviews" and "irresponsible journalism.
The cause of the tirade of the Chronicle was a cablegram, In its own columns the day before, from Trieste, giving,
in limping phrases, an interview with Admiral Dewey. In this interview the great sailor declared with blunt em
phasis that our next war will be with Germany.
This assertion naturally startled the world. Admiral Dewey has not denied it, but the Chronicle seems to
think that he has done so. Acting upon that assumption and forgetting that it had the original interview in its
own columns the Chronicle has become a dyspeptic scold. There are three or four phases of the affair that are
worth comment. In the first place the interview in which Admiral Dewey made his sensational assertion was copy
righted by the New York Herald and was the exclusive property of that newspaper and The Call. The Chronicle
had no right therefore to publish it. The Herald has given the source of Its Information. Does the Chronicle dare
to tell when and how it obtained the interview?
In the second place the Chronicle repudiates editorially what it published as news. In thus stultifying Itself
does the Chronicle wish to be known as a yellow journal afraid of its own color or as a purloiner of news too
cowardly to admit its guilt when caught? An answer to either question would be interesting and probably will not
be forthcoming.
I COMMUNICATIONS â¦
OUR POLICY IN
THE PHILIPPINES
Editor San Francisco Callâ Sir:
I have been a constant and careful reader
of your editorials regarding the Philip- j
pines and the Imperialistic war now be
ing- carried on in the Philippines against
the natives inhabiting those islands. The
Impossible report of General Smith of the
battle against the Babaylones on the isl
and of Panay authenticates the Informa
tion imparted to me by an officer of the
Oregon regiment while being entertained
in my house.
He informed me that in all their battles
the opposing force was very small, but
the fact of their (the Filipinos) being so
well acquainted with the peculiar con
struction of the earth's surface and the
natural protections afforded them by the
bamboo and scrub brush, gave them equal
advantages in fighting strength, and when
lt was reported that they had won a great
battle, defeating a strong detachment of
natives, they had in fact only accom
plished the feat by chasing a few Filipi
nos back into a more desolate portion of
the country, who would return as soon
as our soldiers had abandoned the cap
tured territory.
Regarding the capture of a large quan
tity of supplies, "as always reported by
the press censor," he stated in a manner
which he considered amusing that tne
Americans Immediately upon entering a
captured village would proceed to ran- j
sack every house, church and even hold j
up the natives and procure everything
of value, also that all natives discovered I
coming toward the lines with a flag of â 
truce were shot down. He volunteered
the Information that this was done for
the reason that some of them would
come into the lines to procure food and
would then return to their ranks and con
tinue fighting. There was no positive cvi- ;
dence that they had ever done so, but
it was rumored that such was the case.
In appreciating the above facts seri- i
ously, is it possible to ever convince even J
Ignorant, medieval people that a Govern- j
ment whose representatives are so Inhu- j
man on the field of battle is capable of
giving them a government any better
than that which they have just been freed .
from, and as long as such a war of rob
bery and extermination is carried on they I
will fight until the last man is gone.
He states that the people as a class
are clever, intelligent and progressive,
and. as Dewey says, more able to govern
themselves than the Cubans.
This gentleman has had years of ex
perience in the agricultural line, and is
capable of judging as to the productive
ness of the country, and he expresses the
opinion that it will take a century before
the United States will realize a fair in
terest on their investment, not consider
ing the cost of pacifying the people or
rather exterminating them, and the tax
payer of this country will never receive
an" authentic statement of the exact cost
of this imperialistic conquest. ,- .'
His statements regarding the in
competency of the officers in com
mand are almost beyond belief, and
that the people will realize this to be a
fact when every regiment returning from
the Philippines will authenticate what is
being told by those who have returned,
and when it has cost this Government
millions of dollars for keeping "Wyler
ites" in command in the army who are
acting in accordance and under the In
structions of an Imperialistic political
ring, they will then demand some change,
an early settlement, and some definite
policy regarding the future, of the islands.
A business man who would purchase
property and pay over his cash when it
was impossible for him to secure a clear
title or delivery would surely be consid
ered a flt subject for the asylum. The
people of the United States are not blind
to the fact that several million dollars
was paid Spain for something it did
not own and which it was unable to de
liver-however, we are an imperturbable
race,' stanch believers in standing by the
Government in unavoidable trouble, but
how much longer will we bear the burden
of such an Imperialistic war carried on
contrary to the Declaration of Independ
ence and the teachings of our forefathers?
The policy we are trying to carry out in
the Philippines is worse than England in
tended forcing on our forefathers, as it
is impossible for civilized people used to
a temperate zone to thrive in such a tor
rid climate, and it Is plain to the intelli
gent inhabitants of the Philippine Islands
that our object is to burden them with
a tax, where we have everything to gain
(which will not be much) and their con
ditions will not be bettered.
Wishing you success In your effort to
make this Important question plain to the
lovers of liberty and truth, I beg to re
main very sincerely,
main, vÂ«j j, C. R. COULTER.

VACCINATIONâ M. R. A.. Vallejo, Cal.
The rule that requires children attending
the public schools of California to be vac
cinated, if they have not been vaccinated
within a stated period prior to admission,
is a sanitary one that the Boards of Ed

admission to any child who has not com

POULTRYâ P., City. It is not possible
to make hens sit at will, and in such a
way that one could have chicks hatched
so as to have "fryers and broilers ready
for the market any day in the month the
year round." But such could be accom
plished with artificial incubators provid
ing a sufficient number were used. The
hens will lay the eggs and the Incubators
will do the rest.

OF A PUBLIC OUTRAGE
Emergency Hospitals Closed to Aid
a Shameful Raid.
Political Doctors Prey Upon the Fears of Citizens to
Force the Board of Supervisors to Provide
for Political Rascals.
The Board of Health has gone as far '
ns it dares in its threats to injure the j
city, to jeopardize the health of Its peo- '
pie and to force the Supervisors to pro- I
vide out of the public treasury for the
motley and disreputable herd of Burns !
campaigners.
When the Board of Health took office
the members shamelessly appointed
men utterly unqualified for the posi
tions to which they had been chosen.
Gamblers, roustabouts, tenderloin loaf
ers and political parasites were placed '
in positions where they could render
no public service and. would feed upon :
public bounty.
Feople of .the city were Justly Indig
nant, but the Board of Health Impu
dently replied that the public had no |
choice and the city must pay for the
gang of blackguards chosen to admin
ister affairs of life and death. The
board threatened that if it did not re- j
ceive carte blanche in the way of funds
every health department in the
city would be crippled to such a degree j
that the Supervisors would be forced to
appropriate ail the money that was j
necessary for the outrageous raid. It I
as even insinuated that if necessary j
the political highwaymen, who stood
behind the shoulders of the Board of
Health at the doors of the city treas
ury, would declare an epidemic and
fierce teen the treasury for even
greater thefts. It was shown that the
people of the city would become par
g alyzed with fright and San Francisco ,
* would be dealt a blow from which it
would not recover in years. Frantic
endeavors were made to prove that the
bubonic plague had entered this port,
and that other frightful maladies were
likely to follow In it,** wake. The Board j
of Health was determined to accom
plish its raid.
As predicted in The Call on Sunday, â 
it has now gone as far as it dares in its
shameful schemes. In order to force
the Board of Supervisors to open the
treasury, the Board of Health has
closed ail the receiving hospitals â that
which is located in the City Hall, the
one on the water front and the third I
In Golden Gate Park. The bureau of j
vaccination has been abolished, the de
partment of food inspection has been j
wiped out, the bacteriological annex,
which made itself ridiculous in its ef
forts to find the bubonic plague where j
it did not exist, has reached an inglor
ious end. Assistants in other depart
ments have been removed and every
possible effort has been made to de
moralize the administration of health
affairs in this city.
The board has been utterly unscrup- i
ulous in its daring efforts to accom- I
plish the loot of the treasury, as it
was shameless and impudent in its ap
pointment of political ruffians to pub
lic office. The entire scheme has no
other motive than this.
4 Perhaps the most outrageous action
\ of the Board of Health in this direction
is in closing the Receiving Hospital at J
the City Hall. The members of the |
Board of Health believe that they have
the city by the throat and they intend
to choke it into submission. Utterly
without cause they have closed its main j
receiving hospital upon the absurd â 
ground that it is in an unsanitary con- j
dition. A prearranged report in refer
ence to the condition of the hospital !
was submitted by the Plumbing In- j
spector. The board had no shadow of
excuse for closing the hospital except ;
upon the lame ground that it was un- !
sanitary. As far as emergency cases |
are concerned, the hospital is in a bet- I
ter condition than it has been in years, I
but the Board of Health is determined j
to frighten the people of the citÂ£ to
the last degree.
This was illustrated In an almost j
horrifying manner after midnight this j
morning. The board had decided that I
the hospital should close at midnight. I
notwithstanding the fact that the j
Board of Supervisors had during the ,
afternoon transferred $47.' to the health j
fund to be used in making the improve
ments and repairs which Health Officer I
w Lawlor had declared to be Imperative.
These repairs will cost no more than ]
this sum. and they can be made with
out haste within two days. The Board
of Health said, however, that the hos
pital must close, and at midnight the
doors were locked.
One of the attendants, Dr. Morrison, â¢
however, remained on duty. Shortly j
after midnight Officer McGee brought
a patient in ail haste to the hospital. |
This patient was Martin Riley, a sol
dier In the casual detachment at the j
CONTRACTORS IN
A LIVELY WAR
OVER QUARRIES
Gray Brothers Shut
Out Their Rivals.
4,
Two rival contracting companies and
their laborers came within an ace of be
coming tangled in the throes of fierce
cimb'at at the foot of Telegraph Hill yes
terday forenoon, and had it not been for
the timely appearance of Sergeant Chris
tianson and a squad of police there might
have been urgent need for the ambulance
and perhaps the Morgue wagon.
The quarrel that has been waged long !
nnd bitterly between Gray Brothers and
the Cushing-Wetmore Company reached
a climax' and the laborers of both com
panies reported for duty yesterday morn
ing armed to the teeth and thirsting for
gore.
Gray Brothers and the Cushing-Wet
more Company have been busily engaged
for the last few years tearing big holes
In the rocky sides of Telegraph Hill. Their
quarries at the base of the hill between
Lombard and Winthrop streets are ad
joining, and the boundary line has been
a bone of bitter contention.
About a week ago Gray Brothers blasted
the extreme western end of their quarry
and the falling rocks and debris blocked
a road which was used by the teams of
the Cushing-Wetmore Company traveling
In and out of their quarry from Lombard
street. This move on the part of Gray
Brothers forced their rivals to use Win
throp street as a thoroughfare to their
(uarry. ..-_-- :'- :-
Under the provisions of an ordinance
passed by the Board of Supervisors on
July .1, Gray Brothers were granted per
mission to lay a sixty-foot sidewalk on
Winthrop street. Gray Brothers took ad
Presidio. Riley was taken from Ab
bott's saloon on Grant avenue, a popular
resort for thieves of both sexes and one
of the most disreputable places in San
Francisco or anywhere else. Riley had
been skylarking with one of the women
of the place and thrust his hand I
trfrough a glass door. The wrist was
frightfully lacerated and blood Issued
In spurts from an artery. The patrol
wagon was hastily summonded and, | '
serving as an ambulance, sped in all Â«
haste with Riley and Officer McGee to , >
the Receiving Hospital at the City Hall. <
When the wounded soldier arrived ; 1
there Dr. Morrison insolently refused to >
attend him. The physician declared . i
that the Receiving Hospital had been j I
closed officially at midnight and no pa- I i
tlents, emergency or otherwise, would ; i
be received. The Board of Health is | '
taking desperate measures to force j '
open the doors of the treasury. ]
The soldier's wrist was still bleeding ' ,
profusely. He was becoming weak ,
from loss of blood, but Dr. Morrison
stood haughtily on his officialism and '
declined to render aid. Efforts were '
made to secure by telephone permission j .
from some member of the Board of ]'.
Health to allow the soldier to be treat- j :
cd. Nothing, however, could be done, ; i
The hospital was officially closed and j i
the soldier might die on the step. This | '
climax of outrage indicates to what | '
length the Board of Health is deter- | .
mined to go in its efforts to obey the j .
commands of Its political master. ;
There is absolutely no sincerity in I !
the action of the board in dismissing I j
the employes and paralyzing the ser- ,
vice. This was shown clearly by the I ,
fact that the Chief Food Inspector and i
his assistants have determined to serve j ;
without pay until the question Is deter- j :
mined in the courts. This means that ! '
the Chief Food Inspector and his as- i ,
sistants wish to add a little buncombe j ;
to the blusters of their superiors. As | :
announced in The Call on Sunday, the j :
board met yesterday in secret session I
and adopted the following resolutions: ! ]
Whereas The Board of Supervisors have j ,
failed to appropriate an amount sufficient | I
to the proper conduct of the Health Depart
ment of the city and county of San Fran
cisco, and have only allowed sufficient to
pay the officers especially designated by the
statutes; be It hereby '
Resolved. That on and after the first day <
of August. 1-*'. the following positions un
der the control of this board be declared
vacant: Assistant police surge.. Morrison,
Thompson, Hopper, Dorr and Robinson;
food inspectors. Devoto, Murray, Breeze,
Sullivan. Erkson, Thomas, Lahaney and
Ryan: health inspectors, Crowe and Smith;

spector, J. T. Washington; veterinary* sur
geon. I. W. O'Rourke; plumbing inspectors,
Nolan, Kelly and Connolly; garbage in
spectors. Gregg and Coneo; clerk to health
officer R. M. Jones; assistant market In
spector, He-lilngsworth; ambulance drivers, (

tors. Berliner and Tyrrlll: matrons, Reel,
Swett. Wynne and Eddy; captain of launch, ;
P. McGowan; engineer, Cousins: deckhand, ,
Johnson, and messenger, John 'Wilkins, Be J
it further
Resolved, That the public be hereby noti
fied that on and after the first day of
August 1899, the free vaccination office at
the City Hall will be closed until further
notice: also that the Harbor and Park Re
ceiving Hospitals will be closed until fur
ther notice; that no chemical or bacteri
ological examinations will be made until
further notice.
While this board regrets exceedingly to
be obliged to close to the public these very
important departments, and feels that It
will nececsarHy leave the community with
out proper sanitary protection, and possibly
jeopardize the lives of Its citizens by clos
ing the Receiving Hospitals, we cannot ask |
our employes to serve without compensa- |
tion.
The outrageous action of the Board
of Health in closing the Receiving Hos
pital practically paralyzed last night !
the work of the Police Department. !
Emergency cases that would not be ac
cepted at the Receiving Hospital had
to be taken to the City and County
Hospital on Potrero avenue and Twen- |
ty-second street. If the honorable mem- !
bers of the Board of Health could so |
complacently violate the first oath of j
their profession and permit people to
die under their very eyes, the police j
could not. They therefore used their |
patrol wagons to hurry sufferers out to
the City and County Hospital. This as
a matter of course clogged the admin- |
istration of the Police Department In j
other directions. Offenders were held j
at patrol boxes sometimes for an hour
at a time waiting for a conveyance to
the central or branch prisons. This led I
to the additional outrage of leaving the i
city unprotected and at the mercy of
whatever malefactors cared to operate.
The Board of Health has begun a des
perate and a dangerous campaign to
| raid the city treasury.
vantage of this permission with a venge- !
ance, and on Sunday morning when the -
representatives of the Cushing-Wetmore
Company were sleeping soundly Grays'
men were busily engaged in laying the
sidewalk, which would virtually block the
Cushing-Wetmore Company's only access
and egress to Chestnut street. At each |
end of the sidewalk three stout piles were
driven Into the sidewalk to prevent teams j
passing over the sidewalk.
When Cushlng-Wetmore's laborers ar- ]
rived yesterday morning they attempted
to tear away the sidewalk, and Grays'
men stood hard by to prevent their rivals
from undoing their work. Harsh words
were passed and some angry threats
made, but Sergeant Christianson and his
squad soon quelled the disturbance. The -
matter will be taken into court.
Patrolmen McGovern, Freel, Connor and
Peshon were detailed to protect the prop- j
erty of both firms and keep the peace un
til the matter is decided by the courts.
Bate yesterday afternoon the Gushing-
Wetmore Company's laborers tore up the
objectionable sidewalk on authority fur- I
nished them by a written order from i
Mayor Phelan. The work of removing
the obstruction was carried on under the j
surveillance of the squad of police in at- j
tendance, and no resistance was offered i
by Gray's men. A representative of the i
Cushing-Wetmore Company stated last !
night that to-day they would enter suit j
against Gray Brothers for $25,000 damages.

It was a question as to which were the .
busier yesterday, the Mall dock or the i
transport wharf. Both were worked to |
their full capacity, and any person who
had to visit either pier was compelled to ;
keep a bright lookout In order to avoid
being run over. At the Government wharf
are the transports Hancock. Indiana and
Morgan City; while at the Mail dock
there are the City of Peking, City of Syd
ney, San Bias and Gaelic. All the bag
gage of the Nebraska volunteers was j
taken off the Hancock during the morn- I
ing and sent out to the Presidio. Freight
and supplies were being rushed Into the
Indiana and Morgan City, while gangs of
workmen were engaged on all three yes- I
sels fixing up for another voyage. The
Indiana is to sail to-day with TOO recruits
and the Morgan City Is expected to sail
on Thursday with about 500 recruits.
At the Mail dock double gangs will
work night and day on the City of Peking
until she is discharged. She will then go .
on the drydock for an overhauling, and if
all goes well she will be loaded and away j
again for the Orient by Saturday after- :
noon. The Peking is six days behind
time owing to being quarantined in Naga
said, but she is expected to mako up the ]
time before she gets back to San Fran-

will not be rushed until after fhe Peking
is out of the way. She is scheduled to !
sail on the 9th inst., so there will be
plenty of time to discharge and load her |
before that. The City of Sydney will be
unloaded as quickly as possible and will !
then be overhauled and turned over to the
Government. Her place on the Panama
run will be taken by the San Bias.
Captain E. M. Freeman, the well-known ;
pilot, returned from a visit to the East

visited his brother in Baltimore and his
two brothers in Boston. The captain was
kept busy all yesterday morning shaking
hands with friends, and early in the af- ;

He was using a candle to Bee where the
defects in the pipe were when Foreman
Wilson came along and asked him for the
candle to light his cigar. When the can

talked for a few moments, and the latter,
passed the lighted candle back without
looking where he was putting It. The
flames came in contact with the gasoline
and there was an explosion that seriously
burned both of Gladstone's hands. He
was taken to the Harbor Receiving Hos

LAST REPORT OF THE
SURGEON GENERAL
REORGANIZATION OF MEDICAL
DEPARTMENT, N. G. 0.
Dr. John Gallwey Tells of the In
creased Efficiency of This Branch
of the State Service.
Dr. John Gallwey, surgeon general of
the National Guard of California, has
forwarded to General John Dickinson a
report of the medical department of the
Guard since its reorganization. When Dr.
Gallwey left for Europe recently he was
too ill to complete the report before his
departure. In the document the surgeon
general reviews the condition of his de
partment prior to the appropriation by the
State Legislature for its improvement,
and his comments indicate that tho
medical and surgical branch and the
equipment and supplies were anything
but good. The bill, which appropriated
13000, also provided for the creation of a
sanitary corps as a staff department, a
surgeon general as an executive head,
medical examining hoards and for trans
ference and enlistment of men into the
corps, and all to be properly equipped.
Tne reorganization was duly effected,
as heretofore published, and the numeral
strength of the corps, including naval
militia, now consists of 29 commissioned
officers, 17 non-commissioned officers and
121 privates. By the exercise of much in
genuity the purchase of equipment was
made to come within the limit of the ap
propriation. Dr. Gallwey in his report
highly praises the Red Cross Society and
says that at the outbreak of the Spanish
War the society gave to the Sanitary
Corps, X. G. C, a sum of money for the
purpose of equiping'the medical depart
ment of the California regiments with
everything necessary for active field
service. This money was judiciously ex
pended, and in obedience to an order from
the commander in chief the entire equip
ment was turned over to the Gevernment
for the use of the United States Volun
teer service, and Dr. Gallwey adds: "I
can safely assert from personal observa
tion that no volunteer regiment at San
Francisco possessed an equipment equal
to that of the California Volunteer regi
ments. * * * In a report to the sur
geon general. United States army. Colonel
Mlddleton made special mention of the
virtues of the above-described equip
ment." _uiÂ«*a
Special mention 13 made of the various
camps of Instruction held in 1897, where
the corps received much practical knowl
edge and some experience fn the line of
field and hospital service. In the work
of reorganization much credit is due to
the many executive officers of the Na
tional Guard for advice and assistance,
and though the reorganization has borne
good fruits, there ls still much to be
done. In concluding his report Dr. Gall
wey states that professional not social
qualifications must be the test upon
which commissions should be issued, and
that "the discharge of social and political
debts should not De permitted to disturb
the officers of proved ability in the med
ical department."

ANOTHER JULIET AND
A NEW AIDA CHARM
Miss Roberts Makes a Hit
as Shakespeare's Ten
der Heroine.
IN* London years ago, when Mrs. Bel
lamy played Juliet to Garrick's Romeo, j
and at a rival theater Barry was the \
Montague to Mrs. Gibber's Capulet, !
the play had the unprecedented run of
twelve nights at one theater and thir- I
teen at the other, Garrick's desire to
speak last o'erleaping his terror of the
mystic thirteen. Stupendous revivals,
with magnificent scenery, correct cos
tumes and all-star casts, are the only
ones nowadays billed, for what is com
mon enough with us, the season's run. j
However, It applause is an indication of I
popular approval, "Romeo and Juliet" is a '
| success sturdy enough to reach at least ,
its thirteenth birthday, and need not, to i
make good its announcements, die on the j
seventh night. It is a most pretentious I
production. New scenery has been paint
ed, some new people engaged and, where
the principals are in question, gorgeous i
Hermann gowns and costumes are worn,
I absolutely correct to the period, of course, j
for Hermann would scarce lend his sound
ing name to anything less.
Miss Roberts has spared neither pains
nor expense on her Juliet wardrobe and
the result is a Joy to the beholder. Even j
I her wig, a perfect Venetian red, is a ;
I work of art, made by a local wig maker,
too, after days of patient search for just |
the tint. Mr. Whittlesey's costume sym
phony in red is gorgeousâ simply gor
geousâand when one considers the prices .
at this theater one can but be thankful i
that the artistic sense is so great a part j
of some natures that no handicap is con- |
sidered when its demands are making.
As the shadows close about Romeo's life j
I his costumes grow somber; brilliant red, |
i thoughtful gray, sorrowful black. Mr.
1 Whittlesey's make-up was correctly and j
! handsomely Italian. The stage manager
! has made a success of his scenery. The
! set for the balcony scene, with its vine- j
clad walls, its hangings and its street
distances is well thought out and carried :
one into the atmosphere of the times. '
I The Alcazar lias reason to be proud of I
the result of its efforts. But "the play ,
1 is the thing," and the players, r â :;--.
The Juliets of the stage, past and pres
ent, are, after all, not numerous; for to I
act Juliet well the actress must have so ;
' many years of experience that she ceases
to look Juliet. Miss Roberts comes to the ,
: part with both youth and experience, for |
she was little more than a child when she j
made her professional debut. She is four
teenânot a day olderâ and of how many
Juliets can this be said. They have been
stately and tragic, amorous, tender, elo
quent, seductive, impassioned, and even,
i as in the case of Mrs. Slddons, terrific
and sublime. Miss Roberts brings to the
early scenes a spirit of perfect innocence
and purity. Her childish coquetry in the
dance when her eyes ever seek out Romeo l
is so openly without guile that girlhood is
! patent. She plays the balcony scene for
comedy, and plays it charmingly so. But
before this, in the words "My only love
sprung from my only hate, too early seen
unknown, and known too late," a certain j
undertone of the tragic, the shadow of
Impending doom, which many critics con- I
sider the keynote of the part, makes Itself
vaguely felt. She is weighted with a han
dicap in her scenes with the nurse, for
Miss Leavy lacks real testlnessâ lacks de
cision; and not to know just how one is to
be met somewhat blunts one's intentions. ;
Miss Roberts' Impatience and winning
playfulness met with but little response.
With the first touch of sorrow she ages
and becomes the heroine, and comedy is
left behind forever. The potion scene
i will grow with experience in the part.
Even now the latter half is very strong
i and in places done with a subtle insight
that brings the corse of Tybalt painfully
.before our eyes. In no place does she
overact, and perhaps the fear of this ter
, rible fault accounts for the repression in
.the first part. Miss Roberts has the
strength and undoubtedly the work here
will become what she has the power to
I make it. Her love scenes were all beauti
i ful from the ingenuousness of the girl to
the passionate ardor of the woman, and
her death in the tomb a quiet heartbreak
to all. But we have one more Juliet to
love and are happy. : - -..'.
Mr. Whittlesey as a lover Is always
' worthy of being loved. So ably did he
' plead that, as some one has said before,
Juliet might have forgotten her modesty
and come down to him. Apart from the
j love scenes, his best work is done where
he slays Tybalt and In the tomb. In the
cell with Friar Lawrence he is strong
but somewhat overwrought. But the I
parting with Juliet and the tomb scene |
follow, and then in the satisfaction of
I these what did not quite please us is for
gotten. Mr. Dennithorne's Mercutio was
very good, as were the Benvollo of Mr.
Halifax and the Paris of Mr. Moore.
The other parts were satisfactory, but
' not of exceptional merit. But what of
this? Juliet and Romeo, they are the
play and they have won our hearts. Be
sides, if one sets about it he can find fault
with anything. Pepys. he of the diary,
said of the tragedy, "It Is a play of It-
I self the worst I have seen." Still, if I
remember aright, he saw a version so im-
I proved as to save the life of both Romeo
and Juliet. Miss Roberts and Mr. Whit
! tlaf-ey almost make us wish they had
j known that version, so unhappy do we
I feel that their lovo is for so brief a sea-
I son.
We expected much of both these artists,
I and we have not been disappointed. The
most unstinted praise is due them both.
The advance sale for the week is so large
that an extended run is probable.

Orpheum.
There was "standing room only" at the
Orpheum long before 8 o'clock last night.
The Nebraska boys to the number of
nearly GOO were the guests of honor and
the people turned out by thousands' to
applaud with them the splendid pro
gramme presented by the management.
The Eldrldges, "past masters of colored
comedy," set the ball rolling. They served
i as a splendid introduction to the even
ing's amusement and nearly convulsed
the audience with some of their clever
skits. They were followed by Herr yon
Palm. As a lightning painter in oils he
excels, and some of his pictures were so
true to life that they evoked storms of
i applause. Dave Meier gave a most in
teresting exhibition of bag punching. His
skill at this kind of exercise Is simply
marvelous and he at once established
himself as a favorite with the Nebraska
boys. La Fafalla and the others repeated
their successes of last week, and all In
all the programme left nothing to be de
sired.

Tivoli Grand Opera Season
Has a Brilliant Open
ing Night.
w # OTWTTHSTANDING the fact that -j
|M San Francisco has been surfeited | <
1^ with grand opera this year, the | ]
I " Tivoli Opera-house was almost too j ]
" small to accommodate the monster i j
audience that awaited anxiously the j ]
rise of the curtain in order to revel once .]
more in the Imperial melodies of a master. i
Assuredly the management could not . â¢>;
have made a wiser choice for the inaug- Â»,
uration of Its operatic season than Verdi's *
"Aida"; not merely because this grand ._
musical structure enables an introduction j .
of every strong artist, but because its .
grandeur and grandiloquent airs invest Â»
it with a solemnity especially in accord ; *
with the festive sentiment that accompa- j *
nles an opening performance.
It did not require long to discover the | .
character of the impression made upon j .
the audience by this initiatory perform- j â¢
ance. Hardly had Avadano concluded his â¢
grand aria in the first act when the house j *
began to tremble beneath the applause ] .
that issued forth from the enthusiastic , .
assemblage. Time and again the artist | .
bowed, deeply moved by this immense j â¢
ovation; but the applause would not sub- J â¢
side until the tenor consented to repeat | _
the last few lines. This applause was ; .
honestly merited. A tenor of such crys- j .
talline clarity and mellow tone quality, , .
tinged with splendid dramatic timbre, is j â¢
certainly very rare, and by appreciating : â¢
such a voice the people merely proved j _
their fine powers of discrimination. Ava- : .
dano simply plays with the most dim- .
cult technical parts, and his high notes j .
are as delicious as a kiss. j .
Salassa, in the role of Amonasro, dv- .
plicated his former success. To possess i _
a barytone of such flexibility and power .
ls to be endowed with one of the richest | *
gifts that nature can bestow, but to De j .
so intelligent as to make proper use of
such a marvelous organ is the acme of j t
sublime art, and applause is but a weak , â
tribute to such talent. In the duet In the Â£
Nile scene especially, Mr. Salassa did not ]
hesitate to drain the last drop In the gob- \
let of music. Imperious and imposing, the , J
solemn tones dropped from his lips, his '
phrasing was exquisite; his modulation j -
was sublime. Would that there were Â«
many more artists like Salassa. j *
Mary Linck no doubt is always heard at i
her best as Amneris. Her big contralto 1
has full sway in this role and her dra- i
matic temperament has a fine chance to
assert itself. Miss Linck is an artist. But J
the Interest of the audience was centered I
in Miss Ella Prossnitz. the prima donna, â 
who has just arrived from Milan and in- i
troduced herself as Aida. Miss Proas- i
nitz possesses a dramatic soprano of a
mellow quality. Her upper notes were
elegant and were brought out clear and
ringing. Her lower notes were uttered
with some difficulty, no doubt owing to a
severe cold contracted after a day s stay j
in San Francisco. Her histrionic accom- 1
plishments are great. The Aida of Miss ,
Prossnitz must be pronounced asldealand, j
as far as one can see from last night, the
lady controls a soprano that will prove a
marvel ere the season is passed. ,
Chorus and orchestra did some praise
worthy work and Mr. Hirschf deserves .
much credit for Infusing life and snap in
both. No fault can be found with his (
direction; it was exemplary. George Lask,
the stage manager, deserves also a share <
when praise is distributed. The mounting j 1
W Not e fesa than six curtain calls were | <
.riven after the fourth act, which shows i â â 
the success of the season. This evening
"Lucia" will be given with Anna Lichter h
as Lucia. Barron Berthold as Lord Edgar,
and William Mertens as Henry Ashton. <
It will be an i^^ggmanc^^^ .
California.
Bronson Howard's four-act comedy,
"One of Our Girls,'' which was produced
at the California last night, would not bo
a success in Paris. It is one of the most
caustic satires on the marriage da con
venance and marriage in high life in the
land of the Gaul that has ever been pre
sented on the stage. The first act is
somewhat disappointing; it is smothered
in sermons and Dr. Girodet becomes al
most a bore. The second act is a de
cided improvement and the third is truly
Judged'from the severely artistic point
of view there are but two people in the
cast two people who hold the attention
of the audience by an exhibition of
splendid acting from the start to the
finishâ Blanche Bates as Kate Shipley,
tho American heiress, and Augustus
Cook as the Count Flortan de Crebil on:
the first the type of the American girl as
we like to se? her, the other the Parisian
man of the world with all the vices of
the atmosphere in which he moves, with
the courage of the successful duellist,
and that sense of honor which arises
from the pride of station.
T. Daniel Frawley had but little more
than a walking gentleman's role as Cap
tain Gregory of the Irish Lancers, who,
unlike the Irish captain that one reads
about, is a little bashful and a good deal
woodenv. But that Is the fault of the
author, not of the actor. Hope Ross was
a pretty and interesting French wife in
love with somebody else than her hus
band, and the audience really sym
pathized with the giddy little thingâ the
unhappy victim of a false education.
Charles King had a good make-up as
Foublanque, and Mrs. Bates as the
madame played up to her usual mark of
excellence. ' . . â _â '''â 
"One of Our Girls" will be repeated to
night and Wednesday and Thursday
evenings and at a special matinee on
Wednesday. The remainder of the week,
including the Saturday matinee and thÂ©
Sunday evening production, will be de
foted to "Mme. Sans Gene."
Grand Opera-House.
Seldom has the Grand Opera-house
contained such a delighted audience au
the one last night, when Yon Suppe'a
comic opera, "Boccaccio," with Its spark
ling music, was produced. William Wolff
as the grocer, Arthur Wooley as the
cooper and Wlnfred Goff as the barber
kept up the fun, and many times th*
audience was convlused with laughter
by their broad and catchy humor. The
trio In the first act was encored six or
seven times. Arthur Wooley's song with
the coopers' chorus was also repeated
several times. Edith Mason as Boccaccio,
Julie Cotte as Fiametta. Hattie Belle
Ladd as Leonetto and Bertha Rlcci as
Peronella were In excellent voice and
Thomas H. Persse as Pietro was as usual
pleasing. Georgie Cooper made her first
appearance as Isabella and was the re
cipient of numerous bouquets. The
choruses were well rendered and the evo
lutions of the chorus girls In the last act
called forth loud applause. The opera
went with a swing and there should be
crowded houses during the week.

Soe Matthews, a coon song singer who in

Columbia.
"Heartsease," with Its romantic epi
lodes set to soul-stirring music, opened a
.rosperous second week at the Columbia
ast evening. Henry Miller, Miss Anglin

udes the auditor in imagining the mix

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. July 31.- -There were' a num
ber of depressing Influences brought to bear
on the stock market to-day' and prices opened
lower, but later there was a rally and the ;
close was strong. Conspicuous of the depress- |
ing Influences was the reported outbreak of j
yellow fever at the Hampton (Va). Soldiers* .
Home. The group of railroads liable to suffer
from yellow- fever epidemic and the resulting â¢
quarantines have been favorites in the recent j
speeulatie.n. especially on the part of London, ]
A setback to them, therefore, was calculated I
to have a far reaching Influence in the gen- j
eral list. Louisville and Nasi:-, llle did. in fact, j
open down 1%. and the Norfolk and Western
Stocks, Senuthern Railway and Chesapeake and
Ohio Railway were also depressed and ruled
below Saturday's level all day, only fully re- j
covering in the late dealings. The exhibit .if
the Associated inks in the Saturday state
ment also nad some l'avorabie influence in the
early dealings. A decrease of nearly 12,000 tons
In the eastbounl shipments of freight from
Chicago, as compared with last week, had a â¢
rather halting effect on railroads. The effect
of thesa combined influences was to turn the
tide ejf speculation at first fre-.ni the railroads
into the industrials. The stocks of iron an.i \
steel companies were quite largely bought, but
the earliest strength was confined to a few- I
cf them. Federal Steel, Tennessee Coal Steel
and Wire and American Smelting being th" |
exceptl->r,s to the early strength. Later the j
entire -roup was affected, gains ranging from |
1 to 3%, the latter oressed Steel Car. Ameri- ,
can Tin Plate. American Hoop, American Car
and Foundry and American Smelting all â¢
shared in the movement. The Tobacco stocks
were strong and People's Gas moved upward
on the declaration of the quarterly dividend. I
There was early depression in Sugar on a re
port of additional competition in prospect, and
when this stock rallied strongâ 2% from the
low pointâ the last evidence of weakness was
dissipated. The strength and activity of ail
road stocks was much augmented in the late
dealings, very* heavy blocks being absorbed.
There was continued buying of Southern Pa
cific and Central Pacific, which gained about
2 points each. Northern Pacific, Union Pa
cific, Atchison preferred and St. Louis and
San Francisco first preferred rose from I to 3
points. The coalers were quite strong through
out and Lackawanna was conspicuous for an
upward movement of 6% points. Pittsburg. C,
c and St. Louis rose 3 points. Sterling ex
charge was notably weak, actual rates drop
ping % and posted rates %. There was an ;
abundance of commercial bills in the market
for future delivery against exports and 'he
bankers sold short bills against these. This :
jinel the continued bieidlng for commercial pa- I
j.er on behalf of outside capital tended to re
lieve anxiety on the money question. There .
war consi.lerable selling of the bonds of South
western railroads, which lost something in
p:ice. Otherwise hon-i prices were unchanged ;
or higher. Total sales, par value, $2,374 |
United States 2s and 3s coupon advanced %

the south end. A raise has been started from
this floor and is up one set. It i- intended to
connect tins raise with the 1700 level drift. j
This connection will afford us a good circula
tion of air and enable the work in the stopes j
to be carried on to better advantage. Have
extracted 41 tons of ore of an average assay !
value of $16 41 In gold and 2" tons of ore assay
ing $7 per ton In gold. The ore extracted is

west drift from the C. and C. shaft and the
west crosscut, an engine and fan have been |

The Confederate States Seal.
Th/. original of the great seal of th-Â» |
Confederate States of America is now the j
property of Mrs. Pendleton of Shepherds
town. W. V.. vice president of the Daugh
ters of the Confederacy of West Virginia.
Colonel Alexander R. Boteler, father of
Mrs. Pendleton, was a member of the
United States Congress from Virginia be- j
fore the war. and was a leading and in
fluential member of the Congress of the
Confederate States. He was appointed
chairman of the committee to design a j
great seal for the Confederate govern
ment. Colonel Boteler was one day walk- !
ing toward the monument to Washington i
which stood in front of the capitol at i
Richmond, and thought that he had there
the central idea for the great seal. He
communicated his idea to the committee,
and a design was drafted and sent to
London to a then celebrated artist and
engraver named Wvatt. who reproduced
the design in silver. This was greatly
admired and promptly approved by the
Confederate Congress. From the original
design bronze or copper dies were made
for use, and the original was presented
by the Confederate Congress to colonel
Boteler in recognition of his services and
the appreciation of them by the authori
ties, of the Confederate government. At
Colonel Boteler's death the seal became
the property of his daughter, Mrs. Pen
dleton. The seal ls of solid silver, about
fhree and one-half inches in diameter and
is engraved in high relief.â Baltimore Sun.

erly winds along the northern slope. In tha
immediate neighborhood of the center itself
frequent claims and light variable winds will
be experienced. The probable limits of the
trades are shown upon the chart. Over the
eastern half of the ocean they will be founei
blowing with an average force of 4 (Beaufort
! scale), varying in direction from north north-
I east along the meridian of 130 degrees west to
j Mist northeast In mldocean. and to east south
; east beyond the meridian of 180 degrees west,
especially along and tee the southward of the
j parallel of 10 degrees north. Frequent vari

I Northerly and northwesterly winds will re
place the trades between the American coast
and a line drawn from 40 degrees north. 135 .le
grees west, to 15 degrees north; 110 degree*
west Southerly winds, becoming southwest
erly as we leave the equator, will prevail frord
the American coast westward to 120 deer"-*
west, and from the line to the parallel nf ;i
degrees north. Between 10 degrees ne>rth and
15 degrees north the prevailing direct of thÂ»
wind will be easterly. The winds of this re
gion, especially of its more northerly portions
I will be subject to frequent interruptions by
; tedious calms.
Occasional cyclonic storms of no great in
! tensity may be encountered between the par
-1 allels of 10 degrees north and 20 degree- nortn
along the sailing route from San Francis to
j the line and return. Heavy thunderstorms a--*
I also likely to occur along the coast of Mexico
I and Central America and in the doldrums, or
I region between the trades. Squally weather
may be expected in the vicinity of the Ha
waiian Islands.
The area of low barometerâ The prevailing
westerly windsâ An eastward prolongation of
the area of low barometer central eve conti
nental Asia covers Bering Sea (pressure 29.85
inches). The presence of this low gives rise
to a belt of variable winds mainly from south,
southwest an.l west, extending from the Aleu
tian Islands to latitude 40 degrees north The?-.
winds will have no great strength, owing to
the weakness of the barometric gradient of
slope, their average force being less than 4
on the Beaufort scale. (alms will be frequent
throughout this belt, especially between 155
degrees west and 170 degrees east
Cyclonic and anti-cyclonic circulationsâTem
porary areas of high and low barometer will
I).' found moving in a general easterly direc
tion across the ocean. Around the areas of
high barometer the winds circulate in the same
direction as thÂ» motion of the hands of a watch
(anti-cyclonic); around the areas of low barom
eter in the opposite direction (cyclonic). In
advance of an anti-cyclonic area, or high, the
weather is dry. the barometer rises, and the
thermometer falls, while the general direction
... the winds Is polar or westerly: in advance
of a cyclonic area, or low. ft is damp, the
barometer falls, and the thermometer rises,
while the general direction of the winds ia
equatorial or easterly. The eastward passage
of an anti-cyclone is generally marked by th*
occurrence of light winds and fair weather; of
a cyclone by the occurrence of gales, rain and
toul weather. The progress of the latter a
generally confined to the region between the.
parallels of 35 degrees north and 50 degrees
north. Their occurrence is slightly more fre
quent during August than during July. Out of
2240 observations within the belt specified (35
degrees north to 50 degrees north), and between
125 degrees west an.l 143 degrees eaâst. 10 per
cent gave a wind force above 5, and 3 per cent
above i .Beaufort scale), as compared with 9
per cent and 2 per cent respectively, for the
month of July.
Monsoonsâ The area of low pressure central
over Asia maintains Its depth (29.60 Inches).
The southwest monsoon may be expected to
blow steadily throughout the China Sea. ac
companied by hot. sultry, weather and abun
dant rain, especially along the western coast
of Luzon.
Typhoonsâ The average occurrence of ty
phoons for the month ofAugust, derived from
the observations during the thirteen-year
period 1884-1896. is between 3 and 4. The region
throughout which these storms are most fre
quent and the tracks followed by the several
classes are shown elsewhere upon the chart.
Fogâ Fog and mist will be prevalent along
the American coast, and occasional fog may bo
expected north of the 40th parallel from the
American to the Asiatic coast. Frequent fog
probable above the belt shown on the chart.

The Voters Will Not Take Orders
From the Bosses or Go to Saloon
Headquarters for In
struction.
Â«
Yesterday the Registrar of Voters sent
a. communication to each .if the organized
political parties asking that the Election
Commissioners be furnished with the list
of the delegates to be voted for at the
primary election. The object of this re
nuest Is to print the names in the tally
Viooks to he used at the polls. The organ
izations receiving this letter are not at
this time able to comply with the request.
In the selection of delegate tickets con
siderable headway has been lade by the
City Republican League, the organization
of which Henry T. Scott Is president, and
also by the executive committee of the j
Democratic Committee of One Hundred.
The clubs formed under the auspices of j
the Republican County Committee are at !
â¢work in each Assembly district in the pre- j
paration of a ticket, but there are no in- j
dications that the tickets will be ready j
for transmission to the Registrar before j
the latter part of this week.
it is feared now that the Election Com
missloners will not receive the names in
sufficient time to have them printed in the
tally book, and as a result the clerks 'at j
the various polling places will be com- |
pelled to write the names ii the tally |
book. There is a strong suspicion that J
some of the regular politicians are :hem- ;
ing for delay in order to defeat the true j
purposes of the primary election law. j
Under the most favorable conditions, with
the names printed in the tally book, it will
take a long time to canvass the vote, and
if the names have to he written In the
book an interminable length of time |
would be needed to complete â  he canvass. ,
To-me>rrow evening there will be a meet- j
ing to organize the advisory central club
of the Republican County Committee, i
Yesterday A. J Raisch; chairman of the >
committee; sent out the following notice
t" each one of the delegates recently
chosen:
The meeting of the delegates of the Advisory I
Central Club of the Republican party will he I
held Wednesday evening, August 2, at I
lie;:, for the purpose of effecting permanent J
; â : â -a.'-.i.-.utii.in. You hare been elected a delegate
t.v your district club to represent them in
s-u. h â¢ realization. Your attendance is re
quested.
It is asserted at Republican headquar
ters that the enrollment of voters on the i
r- gular club rolls numbers 11,800. The Call
bi lieves this is an overestimate, but rec
ognizes the fact that many independent
â¢eet.rs who have hitherto withheld their
names from club rolls were recently en
rolled. This large enrollment does not in
the slightest degree signify that the Re
publicans so enrolled propose to take or
ders from Kelly and Crimmins, or go to
the saloon of any other boss for instruc
tions. These Republicans will take the
best ticket presented to them in their re
spective districts and will use their influ
ence to secure the election of men of char- |
acter and ability to compose the conven- j
tion. I
. . .
There never was a time in the history I
of the Republican party In Ban Francisco
that the voters of th.' party entertained so
little respect, for bosses and boss meth
ods. It Is doubtful if i 'rimmins and Kelly '
could recruit a following of 1000 voters in
the whole city.
If the organization which has its head
quarters in the Grand Hotel puts the
best delegate tickets in the field it will
likely win out in the contest for the con- i
trol of the convention, as the Republicans
enrolled in the regular clubs are free to
express their choice at the polls. The pri
mary election gives the people a chance
to control the convention and if good men

The Democratic factional fight In the
Thirty-eighth Assembly District Is becom
ing intensely bitter. Last night Buckley's
followers; believing that they were being
duped by the Kainey men In the Gallagher
club met in Powers Hall and organized
a Buckley club. There are now three
Democratic clubs In the Thirty-eighth.
The fine representing the McN'ab faction
is headed by Bert Schlesinger. The
Lainey-Examiner league is represented
hy the Gallagher club, and John J. Sulli
van is president of the Buckley club which
was organized last night. The indications â 
are that ere will be three delegate tick
ets ln the field.
The Democratic campaign has been en
livened by one very funny incident. The I
Rainey-Examiner league, i ring that i
they were getting the worst end i if it in i
the contest with the Democratic execu
tive committee, fancied it would be a
good scheme to have an arbitrator ap- â 
pointed to adjust the differences in dis
tricts where Rainey and the Examiner ,
were weak. So word went out that ex-
Judge Jeremiah I-". Sullivan had been
clothed with all the powers iif a court of
arbitration. The disgruntled and discon
tented Democrats who had grievous bur
dens to bear were all I vised to go to
Judge Sullivan's law office for consolation
and redress. Rainey and the Examiner
did not select Sullivan until they had gone
down the line of a long list of Democrats
without finding one to step in and arbi
trate. One prominent Democrat who was
offered the position of arbitrator was ad
vised by his friends to go out in the
Thirty-ninth District for an hour and
practice titration and then consider how
he felt after he Nad passed the ordeal in
that section of the city. In most of the
districts the Democratic fight is shaping
itself to a contest between Buckley on one
GRAPE-NUTS.
FOOD AND WEATHER.
Temperature Increased or Re-
duced by Food.
The old army ration for the tropics
has been very sharply criticized for the
reason that it consists of articles of
food that any person even slightly ac-
quainted with the elements of food
knows is not adapted to the needs of
ill-- human stem in hot weather.
Nature shows forth in the selection of
food by inhabitants of various coun-
tries; for instance, the Esquimaux in
a cold climate selects heavy, carbon-
aceous ids, tallow, bacon and such;
while the Hindoo and inhabitants of
hot countries turn to the cereals for
sustenance.
We should follow this hint of nature,
and particularly in hot weather should
avoid much butter, meat or any of that
class of food. Perhaps a little meat
once a day Is not amiss, even it. hot
weather, but the breakfast and lunch
Should be made of fruit, one or two
slices of entire wheat bread and some
Grape-Nuts and cream. Grape-Nuts
are mentioned, because they furnish
the ideal cereal food In a most palat-
able and delicious form, in addition to
which, they are ready cooked and re-
quire no attention whatever from the
cook.
A person can pass through weather
that may be intensely hot In a comfort-
able manner if the food be properly
selected, and the above suggestions can
he put Into practice with most excellent
results. Price 15 cents per package.

! THIRTY-SEVENTH DISTRICT. j
Republicans Nominate a Ticket to Be
Voted For at the Primaries.
An exciting meeting of the Central Re
publican Club of the Thirty-seventh As
sembly District was held in Central Hall,
on Devisadero street, last night, and
twenty-four names were finally selected
j as the nominees of the- party in thai sec
tion of the city fe.r delegates to the mu
nicipal convention. The men chosen will |
be voted for at the primary election next j
! Tuesday The ticket selected was agreed i
â  upon at a conference of representatives of )

A delegation from the Kelly and < 'rim- j
mins "push" was present for he purpose
of breaking up the meeting, and although
they. were outnumbered their hoodlum tac
tics nearly proved successful in accom
plishing their purpose. T. Jones, a ward
striker from the Crimmins camp, was par
ticularly offensive, and In a final desper
ate effort to cause disruption by precipi
tating a riot he indulged in a stream of
vituperation directed at all who opposed
his alleged views, and then dared any one 1
to throw him out. A dozen men sprang to
'their feet to accommodate the belligerent
"striker," but better counsel prevailed
and a semblance of order was finally re
stored. _ I
J. P. McMurray. a disappointed offlce- .
seeker of the gang ."tripe, loudly seconded j
the efforts of the chief disturber, and ad
ditional confusion was caused by a large
an respectable element in the club who
became convinced that they were being
hoodwinked into indorsing a job ii the 1
selection of the district nominees. Among:
the latter were Holla V. Watt and A. Til
den; th. latter being one of those honored
by a nomination. Mr. Tilden resigned the
honor because, as he stated, the commit
tee which had been intrusted with the
task of selecting the list had not yet
authorized Chairman Heghler to make a:
report and that therefore the entire pro
ceeding was irregular. He then left the J
halt but it is understood that he has al- i
ready reconsidered his resignation, which j

tertain because it was not made in writ- >

that Rock had the rolls of both clubs in j

bers filed out of the hall, and they say
they will meet next Wednesday to elect

Are Filed.

Oakland offlce San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, July 31.
Two sensational complaints foreboding
an interesting contest over the estate of
the late Henry D, Bacon, which was dis
tributed some years ago. were filed In
the Superior Court late this afternoon, and
simultaneously a lis pendens was recorded
'â  against all of the property of the Bacon
Land and Loan Company, located in San
Joaquin, El Dorado and Alameda counties,
by Professor Frank Soul., and Mamie C.
â  Bacon, formerly the wife of Frank P.
Bacon.
The defendants named in either com
' plaint are Julia Ann Bacon, Frank P. Ba
i con, Ella Etta Bacon-Soule, Carrie Jenny
Bacon, the Bacon Land and Loan Com
pany (a corporation); and Frank Page Ba
-1 con Ella Etta Bacon-Soule and Carrie
: Jenny Bacon, as executors of the last
i will and testament of Henry D. Bacon,
I who died in February, 1893. The attorneys
for the plaintiffs are Bishop & Wheeler
and William Deamer. with ex-Senator Guy
C. Earl also associated as counsel.
The suits, the facts alleged in either
' complaint being Identical, have, for their
purpose the setting aside of the decree of
distribution in the estate of Henry D.
: Bacon, on the ground of fraud and mis-
It is charged outright that defendants
represented to plaintiffs that they were
: each to receive $2000 under the terms of
the Bacon will, when in reality the legacy
jin either case amounted to 510,000. The
! will was originally read aloud to the
i heirs by Attorney F. A. Berlin. the lega
i cies of ' Frank Soule and Mamie C. Bacon
i being announced at $2000 each, and later
: the legatees were furnished copies of the
' will, which also read $2000. They accepted
; this' amount, but subsequently the orig
inal will was inspected, when it was dis
covered. so plaintiffs allege, that Henry
D Bacon had written "ten" insteao of
"two." The will has since been photo
' graphed. Mr. Berlin pleads mistake pure
and simple on his part in reading the
amount of the legacies.
The complaints charge the defendants
with knowingly stating as a fact to these
plaintiff beneficiaries that tn.-- amount of
their legacy was $2000 instead of $10,000,
to mislead them and prevent them con
, suiting the record.
In August, 1893.. the widow and her three
children formed the corporation known as
the Bacon Land and Loan Company, in
corporating with a capital stock of $.".,000,
--000. and conveying to the corporation all
â â  their Interests in the estate of deceased.
"subject to the payment of the legacies
i provided for in the will." .--. â  â "-, :*
Subsequently on petition of the execu-
I tors it was represented to the court tnat
the legacies had all been paid, and the
court then distributed the estate, the resi
i due amounting to about $600,000, *o the
corporation.
Plaintiffs in the present suits purpose,
i now to have the Bacon Land and Loan
Company declared t.i hold the property if
; the old estate subject to the lien -of the
balance of the two legacies, which now
aggregate, with principal and interest,
to about $23,000.
Included in the property affected by the
lis pendens is the entire west half-block
bounded by Washington, Eleventh and
Twelfth streets, being located in the heart
j of this city. '
SPICY ANSWER IN THE
SMITH DIVORCE CASE
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, July 31.
Norman H. Smith of Wisconsin, through
his attorney, H. S. Aldrich. to-day filed
a sensational answer and cross-complaint
in the divorce suit commenced on June 15
last by his wife, Minnie Smith, who
gained considerable notoriety last month
when she charged aged Arthur Arlington,
the bunkoer of widows, with having
robbed her of $215.
Arlington was held on June 14 to answer
before the Superior Court, and on the fol
lowing day Mrs. Smith tiled a divorce suit
against her husband, charging extreme
cruelty, Her original complaint recites
that she and Norman Smith were married
at West Superior, Wis., in May, 1!<93, and
that for a year prior to bringing this ac
tion she had been a resident of Califor
nia. The acts of cruelty narrated extend
from Mabton, Wis., to the State of Wash
ington and to San Diego. The wife al
leges that on one occasion her husband
tore her clothes, threw a pistol at her and
drove her from their home at Mabton with
her infant; that he frequently killed the
chickens and destroyed the eggs so that
she could have nothing to eat; that when
she went to live with her sister in L- is
Angeles in 1885, defendant husband fol
lowed her and made life with him unbear
able' that while living with him at Santa
Monica he choked her and threatened to
shoot her, as well as her sister, and.
finally that on one occasion tho husband
spoiled a Christmas dinner by pouring
kerosene over it. . â ,A .^
The husband threatens to fight the ease
bitterly. He has telegraphed his attorney
that he is now on his way to this State,
and he promises to make matters decid
edly interesting. It appears that he him
self sued for a divorce last February, and
in answering said suit Mrs. Smith admit
ted that she was a resident of Wisconsin
for more than a year next preceding tne
commencement of the suit. Now in her
complaint she swears she has a residence
In California. c , â . . 7. . . ,
In his answer filed to-day the husband,
after denying the allegations of cruelty
and his wife's residence in this State,
makes grave charges of her having disre
garded the solemnity of her marriage
vows on November 24, 1898, and January.
1889 at Lake Mills. Wis., naming August
H Wegeman as co-respondent, and on
May 14 1890. ; " San Francisco, infidelity
is again charged, this time A. Arlington
being named as co-respondent.
Smith does not ask for a decree of di
vorce but prays that his wife take noth
ing by her suit and that he be given cus
tody "of their minor child. Jessie Smith,
alleging that the mother is not a fit and
proper person to have control of her.

NATIONAL PLANS
FOB WASHINGTON
STREET BRIDGE
Solution of Difficulty
Is Proposed.
â â¦ â
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 31.
The trouble over the Washington-street
bridge is now in a fair way to disappear.
The situation of affairs at present .points
to an abandonment of Washington avenue
as a thoroughfare in the Fruitvale dis
trict.
J. R. Talcott, chairman of Supervisors,
sent the following letter to W. H. Heuer.
major. Corps of Engineers, United States
army:
OAKLAND. July 24. 1899.â W.H.. H. Heuer, Esq..
major. Corps of Engineers. U. S. A.â Dear Sir:
In yours of July 21 to the Board of Supervisors
of Alameda County you say "As I cannot build
two combined bridges starting from a common
point etc.," and asking us to waive the con
struction of any bridge for highway traffic
across canal, other than that proposed at
Fruitvale avenue, between Park and High
streets, I would say:
We take it for granted from the reading of
the above that the railroad company will not
require a bridge on Washington avenue and
that they also have been requested to waive
their right of way on said Washington avenue.
Are we correct? Respectfully yours,
J. R. TALCOTT, Chairman Supervisors.
The reason for the delay, according to
Major Heuer's reply, which is quite
lengthy depends upon the necessity of
things as it is compulsory to build the
bridge before the tidal canal can be com
pleted. The most important section of
the letter Is as follows:
The railroad company expressed a willing
ness to waive the construction of a bridge
at Washington avenue provided the Govern
ment would furnish a right of way, and lay
tracks on the same, connecting by a short
practicable route the proposed Fruitvale ave
nue bridge with existing Fern_ride-M.el.-ose
track. This appeared fair and equitable, an.l
if It could have been accomplished would have
saved the Government an expense of at least
$30,000. lt was ascertained, however, that there
was no law which would permit of the ac
ceptance of such terms, and such solution
could not be further considered.
The railroad company could not be expected
to purchase the strip of land above referred to
and lav track on same at an expense of 110.
to (13,000 without some compensating advan
tage, and in the absence of law the Govern
ment could not transfer to the railroad com
pany a strip of land and connecting track,
even though all the advantage*, were on the
side of the Government. The exchange, if lt
could be so called, would require special action
by Congress, and If authorized would require
that the land necessary for the connection be
acquired by condemnation proceedings. Judg
lag from what has occurred In the past in
similar proceedings of this work, this would
have delayed the completion of the tidal canal
for at least six years, to the detriment of the
work Itself and to the prejudice of the peo
ple of Alameda County.
The matter now rests with you. As yet I
have nee legal waiver of your right to a high
way bridge at Washington avenue. I am
looking solely to the rapid completion of the
won. as authorized by Congress. If you waive
thÂ» right to a highway bridge at Washington
avenue unconditionally. I believe the work of
completing Oakland harbor can go on uninter
ruptedly, If you cannot see your way clear
to do this, the work must cease as soon as I
have made contracts for and completed High
street and Fruitvale avenue bridges, and be
delayed until Congress modifies its previous
action, furnishes funds and authorizes a
change In the existing project. Very respect
fully W. H. HEUER.

Crushed Between Gravel Cars.
ALAMEDA, July 31.â John- May, who
resides on Encinal avenue, near High
street, was injured Friday night at the
"sink." He was engaged in unloading
gra el from dumpcars, when the train
started. In trying to save himself from
falling under the wheels May got his left
arm caught between the bumpers. Both
bones of the forearm were splintered, .ie
sharp ends protruding through the fl;sh.
Crushed by Ealling Pipe.
BERKELEY. July 31.â Barrett Fisher,
an employe of the Hofburg Brewery in
West Berkeley, is In a critical condition
at the East Bay Sanitarium as the result
of attempting to move some of the fix
tures of the brewery. While handling
some barrels a heavy iron pipe fell from
an upper story and struck th- man on
the head, severely crushing his face and
neck. While the injuries did not prove
fatal, their extent Is such that Fisher
may be made an invalid for life.
Had His _Left Leg Broken.
Otis Nelson and Harry Stewart went to
the residence of Chris 'Christiansen, on
Tenth avenue, near Q street. South San
Francisco, last night, and in a scuffle
which followed Nelson fell and broke his
left leg. Tie was taken to the Receiving
Hospital and attended by Dr. Lane. A
charge of battery was placed against
Stewart, and < 'hristianson will swear out
a warrant for the arrest of Nelson to-day.
Christianson claims that the two men.
who were drunk, came to his house and
proceeded to assault him without any
provocation. Nelson is a laborer, 28 years
old, and lives on Fifth avenue, near M
street.

Blood Cure Sent Free
A Free Trial Treatment Sent Privately by Mail to All Who
Suffer.
A Remarkable Remedy for a Terrible Affliction â The Cure Is
Permanent,
A free trial treatment is being sent out
by the State Medical Institute in order
to demonstrate the fact that the most
horrible of all diseases can be cured.
There is a good deal of controversy over
this subject among those who declare the
disease incurable, but the facts are in-
dubitable and must be acknowledged. The
action of this new remedy Is peculiar. The
physician In charge of the institute has
had a Long and varied experience treating
this disease of the Ho. and about two
years ago, after a long series of experi-
ments, he found the exact specific that
offsets' the poison, renders it lifeless and
eliminates it from the body. Having per-
sonally examined many hundreds of cases
and familiarized himself with every de-
tail of the disease, his discovery came
naturally and has never failed him. One
of his recent cures was a most hopeless
case, the disease having caused the hair
to fall out and the body was one mass of
putrescent sores, boils, blotches and un-
sightly disfigurements. In ten days the
entire outer skin was healed and there
CHINESE COOK
THREATENS TO
POISON A BABY
Being Dismissd He
Seeks Revenge.
â â¢ â
ALAMEDA, July Mrs. George R.
Chambers of 1829 Clinton avenue has re
ceived anonymous threats through the
mail that unless she dismisses her Japa
nese servant he will be shot and the milk
used by her baby will be poisoned. The
threatening missive bears the Oakland
postmark and is supposed to be the work
of a Chinaman named Kay, or a Japanese
who covets the position now held by Mrs.
Chambers' servant.
Ah Kay worked in the Chambers house
hold up to last Wednesday, when he was
summarily dismissed. He was indignant
at being discharged and muttered some
thing to the effect that Mrs. Chambers
would be sorry. The following Friday
Mrs. Chambers received the annexed let
ter:
Mrs. Chamber: Me yon China frien. Me
no iik sen my fren go. Kay. No Ilk opostte
house .Trippâ-, make you my fren go. You
see him. I kill him, poison baby milk every
lavs. Me no care other girl other Jappee.
HI BIN DAS LEE.
Mrs. Chambers took the letter to the
Chinese cook at the home of Mrs. Peter
White, her aunt, who had recommended
Kay. He insisted that Kay had no knowl
edge of English, and that as far as high
binders were concerned he claimed that
he was "boss" of one of the tongs and
he would take it upon himself to see that
no harm was done the Chambers family
from that source.
Mr. Chambers, who is secretary of Glad
ding. McÃean & Co. of San Francisco,
was not at home when the letter was re
ceived and did not arrive until Saturday.
He at once reported the matter to the po
lice and every precaution has been taken
to prevent "Hibandas Lee" from putting
his threat into effect.
PRIVILEGES ABUSED.
Well-to-Do Residents of Alameda
Insist Upon Free Vaccination.
ALAMEDA, July 31.â Health Officer L.
W. Stidham is authority for the assertion
; that the well-to-do people and society
! lights of Alameda have been systemati
cally abusing the free vaccination privi
'- leges. The Board of Health intended the
privilege for those who were financially
' unable to have their children comply with
the school restrictions requiring vaccina
tion. Blanks were printed for the signa
tures of the applicants setting forth that
I the parent was unable to pay a physi
cian. ;
Dr. Stidham says that some of the so
' ciety leaders of the city have applied for
these blinks. signed them without
, compunction and sent their children with
them to the Health Office. Ladies dre.s-.ed
in silks and bedecked with diamonds have
applied to Dr. Stidham to vaccinate their
children free of charge, asserting without
a blush that they were too poor to pay
' for the operation.
The Board of Health will take action to
prevent the abuse of the free vaccination
. privilege in future.
DR. MONTAGUE ARRIVES.
BERKELEY, July .11.â William P.
Montague of Harvard University, who
has been elected as instructor in the de
partment of philosophy in the University
of California, has arrived from the East,
and is making preparations for the work
of the coming term.
Dr. William Montague is a Harvard
man, and he is leaving the big Eastern
university to come to the Pacific Coast.
For some years he has been an instructor
under Professor William James, the psy
chologist, who visited Berkeley last year.
He is regarded by Professor James as
one of the most promising scholars among
the younger men in philosophy.
Dr. Montague was chosen by the Board
of Regents to succeed Dr. E. B. McC.il
varv. who has recently gone to Cornell
University to take charge of the chair of
philosophy there. During the absence of
Professor Harrison in Europe. Dr. Mon
tague will occupy his residence on Ban
croft way.
Will Sue for Wife's Property.
OAKLAND, July 31.â Judge Greene to
day appointed William O'Connell guardian
of the person and estate of his wife. Jo
hanna O'Connell, who was released on
parole from. Agnews Insane Asylum re
cently. The guardian's bond is fixed at
$250. It is understood to be the purpose of
the guardian to tile suit for the recovery
of property on Peralta street valued at
$5000 which Mrs. O'Connell deeded to her
niece, Miss Julia Barry, several years ago,
the deed for which, however, was not
recorded until a few days after Mrs.
O'Connell's commitment to the asylum.
There was a very bitter contest over the
appointment of the guardian and the legal
was noticeable improvement in all other
respects. A brief continuation of the rem-
edy brought about a radical cure.
The free trial treatment has saved a
great many who otherwise were doomed
to early destruction, and it was this ob-
ject which induced the institute to make
the 'offer. In all cases where the sores
have become characteristic of the disease
the. sufferer fully realizes the name and
nature of his or her affliction, but a great
many win: have Inherited the disease or
who have recently contracted it should
ask the institute for their 44-page book
describing fully the disease and also ex-
plaining the action of their new remedy
Sililide. Send your name and address to
the State Medical Institute, 14S Bass
block. Fort Wayne. Ind., and they will
forward, prepaid, a free trial treatment
that will bring to the sufferer such won-
derful relief, such an ecstatic feeling of
joy for the Improvement shown as to ful-
ly compensate for the suffering and de-
spair that previous failure has caused.
Write to-day without fail.
battle over the property promises to be
even more Interesting.
Fraternity Robbed.
BERKELEY. July 31.â The Phi Delta
Theta. a fraternity on the corner of Du
rant avenue and Dana street, has suf
fered another loss at the hands of burg
lars. The fraternity recently lost its
chapter house by tire, and during the re
building all the furniture and personal
effects of the college men have been
stored in a barn behind the house. Two
months ago the barn was entered by a
gang of boys and completely rifled of all
the valuables removable. The goods were
recovered and the boys let off with a
caution. The caution seems to have had
no effect, however, as the same boys are
said to have stolen the identical things
again. Marshal Lloyd Is on the lookout
for the perpetrators.
A peculiar and important difference be
tween petroleum as used In Europe and
In the United States is that in the latter
the crude article is employed as it comes
from the well, while Russia and Italy
an.l other European countries use tho
refuse that is left after the lighter con
stituents of the oil have been removed by
a partial distillation. . â -,'â ?â .
Richâ Yet Starving.
Doctors frequently have very wealthy pa
tients who are starving to death. They have
money to buy food, but their stomach has not
the strength to digest it. It lies there a heavy
fermented mass, the sole cause of dyspepsia,
nervousness and biliousness. The surest rem
edy to cure a weak stomach Is Heistetter's
Stomach Bitters. It will restore vigor to the
digestive organs. Nothing is "just as good. "

PERRAULT AND
PHELAN DISCUS.
THE TAX LEVY
Corkscrew Franchise
Is Granted.
â â
FUNDS FOR THE HOSPITALS
â * â
COUNTY INSTITUTION â TO BE
IMPROVED.
â¦-
Supervisors Argue Different Phases
of Appropriations. That Must Be
Made, but Decide to Wait
Upon the Merchants.
Supervisor Perrault precipitated some
rather heated debate anent the tax levy
at the board meeting yesterday by calling
upon Mayor Phelan to say why he had not
kept his word to the Finance Committee
by submitting an official statement show
ing how the numerous departments might J
be provided for In the levy and the dollar
limit maintained.
Mayor Phelan denied he had ever prom
ised to outline a plan, but said he had de
clared himself ready at any time to meet
the committee and render it advice and
assistance. Supervisor Perrault insisted
that his Honor had promised an official
statement, and his Honor Anally ceased
to deny It and avoided further distasteful
debate by bringing up the dire need of
the Health Department in so -far as the
Receiving Hospital was concerned. He \
said he had been informed by the depart- ;
ment that $500 to be expended in sanitary i
plumbing would be needed before the â¢â 
hospital could be reopened, and he handed
down a resolution allowing it $175. Super- !
visor Collins made it an occasion to
strongly criticize the action of the health
authorities in' closing the establishment,
ami said in support of his allegations thai
he had been in the hospital several times
in the past seven months and had never ,
noticed the odor of sewer gas or anything
else objectionable. Despite Mr. Collins'
argument the resolution was adapted and
the hospital will be open again for busi
ness as soon as the necessary sewer con
nections can be made.
Supervisor Phelps stirred up more dis
cussion by asking who had let the con
tract for elevators in the new Hall of
Justice. His attention was called to the
matter by a resolution before the board
to pay th- contractors $13,300 for building
them. No one knew who had let the
contract, and Supervisor Holland, chair
man of the Building Committee, declared
that the claim had never been allowed
by his committee and was not properly
before the board. Further discussion de
veloped the fact that the original con
trait called, for five elevators to cost not
more than 114.000, but that only four ele
vators had been built, and $13,300 was de
manded for them. It also transpired that
the contract had been let by Shea & Shea,
the architects, without authority by reso
lution of the board. It proved too knotty
a problem to handle at one sitting and
was Anally referred to the Building Com
mittee for investigation.
Supervisors Lackmann and Perrault of
fered a resolution requesting Governor
Gage to declare the day of the arrival of
the Fust California In this city a legal
holiday. It was adopted unanimously, as
was another, extending a cordial invita
tion to President ParArio Diaz of Mexico
to visit this city when he makes his tour
of this country In September and Octo- 1
ber next. . _
Hi.is for the "corkscrew franchise
asked for by the Market Street Railway
system were opened, and that company
proved to be the only bidder. Its pro
posal was made on the lines laid down in
' the charter and was accepted by unani
mous vote of tin- board. The board also
adopted the plan proposed by the Mer
chants' Association for the purchase of
Fire Department supplies. On motion of
Byington, it was amended so as to in
clude every department of the city gov
ernment.
The statement of the Market-street
i Railway Company that the gross income
from certain of the lines of its system
; during the past fiscal year was $48,-),
was approved, and $0715 __â 2 per cent of
the receiptsâ was ordered paid Into the
treasury. This payment will make pay
able the Street Department labor claims
for the month of June. ;
A resolution was adopted rescinding
I that portion of the temporary tax levy
i which appropriated $600 for the payment
I of the clerk of the Board of Equalization.
The amount was Axed at $1200 instead,
and the clerks, who have been unpaid,
will now receive their money. .-''-';
A resolution directing the Finance Com
mittee to make a special appropriation in
the tax levy for the sanitary improvement
of the City and County Hospital was re
i ferred to the Building Committee to de
i termine what the necessary improvements
' would cost. _ _, _
City and County Attorney Lane tiled an
opinion with the board which establishes
the contention that the grade of a street
once fixed cannot be changed, except un
der a general adjustment of damages. The
property directly under consideration was
a lot at' Twenty-first and Sanchez streets.
The grade of the street at that place was
Axed in 1866 at 340 feel above the base. In
1888 the board raised it fifteen feet, render
ing property along the line practically
valueless. Owners petitioned the board to
repeal the resolution of 'SS, but Mr.
Lane decided that the matter was already
settled In their favor In numerous de
cisions of the Supreme Court.
Lackmann moved to adjourn at the call
of the chair that the board might meet
with the Merchants' Association when
that body brings in its tax levy, and after
some discussion his motion was permitted
to prevail. â¢ ... -.:â ".â¢â¢

BOSS BUCKLEY DISCLOSES
UGLY SECRETS OF THE PAST
The Examiner Was Sold Out More Than Once to
Huntingtonâ lnside Story of the Mayne
Railroad Franchise Scheme.
Buckley Reveals Interesting Incidents in His Career as Confidential
Adviser and Political Manager of the Examiner,
SPECTATORS of the fight between
Buckley on one side and the Rai
ney-Examiner league on the other
expected thai the Rainey newspa
per which made, a few days ago.
such a furious attack on Boss Buckley
would follow up the assault! As Buck
ley promptly responded with ugly dis
closures concerning th Examiner's as
sociation with bosses, the unterrifled
Democrats, who enjoy a fight to the l
finish, suppnsed that the Examiner j
would forthwith turn loose on the i
"Blind White Devil" and do some rare
roasting. The surprise of the campaign j
is the silence of the Examiner. The j
Democrats are wondering If the Ral- i
Examiner league has not taken
alarm at the prospect of a controversy
which may disclose to the public the
long-concealed truth about the pur
chase of a seat in the United States
Senate.
Good citizens rejoiced at the prospect
of a fight between old-time busses and
political manipulators, believing in the â¢
.'..lac,- that "honest men get their dues j
when rogues fall out."
The fact is well established that the
relations which existed between the
Examiner and Buckley for many years
were confidential and intimate. The old
Evening Examiner was purchased at
the suggestion of Buckley and con- j
verted into a morning light. "When I
there was no money at the business j
office to pay the hands the conductors j
of the paper went to Buckley's Bush- .
street saloon and borrowed the coin j
to meet the deficit. When doubts arose i
in the editorial department as to what
course the paper should pursue on na
tional. State nd local affairs Buckley
was summoned. A carriage was sent,
to bring him post haste to the office. j
Time, however, changes all things, j
Buckley Is no longer the source of Ex- ;
aminer inspiration, A new boss has i
arisen and th" St. George Stable is the
fountain of Democratic wisdom am! re- j
form.
iking of the past. Buckley, who
was yesterday in a serene and remi- I
niscent frame if mind, contributed the j
following chapter to the political an
nals of San Francisco:
"When young Hearst obtained pos
session of the paper my advice was i
often sought by him. Frequently a car
riage would be sent to my house and I ;
would go to the Examiner office and
there be interrogated by its proprietor
ns to the policy of the paper on mat
ters of political import. 1 also ap- |
peared in the capacity of a friend and
attorney of the paper to settle a libel.
suit that might have cost the paper
thousands of dollars and possibly sent I
Its editor to State's prison." '
"What case was that?" he was asked, |
"That was the case of Hon. F. F. j
Strother," he replied.
"What were the circumstances?" !
' Mr. Strother was the Auditor of the I
city," continued Buckley, "and to my !
knowledge proved the best we ever had. i
Well, he had nerve enough to give the
Bulletin or some other paper some !
printing and as this was antagonistic j
to the-. Examiner it attacked him un- j
mercifully. They called him a male- \
factor and other strong names and Mr.
Strother promptly secured the services
of S. M. Wilson and commenced a suit
against the paper for a very large sum
pf money for damages. The Examiner
conductors sent for me to help them
cut of the affair and it was only after
a hard struggle that we could get Mr.
Strother to withdraw his suit, as we
thought it v. mid be detrimental to the
Democratic party. He did not, how
ever, dismiss the suit until thÂ« Ex
aminer had made public reparation.
"If I am the bad man I am accused j
of being; if I am the character they are I
presenting to the public, why is it they j
Bought my advice for their paper; why j
is it they asked my aid in suits of j
libel: why did the proprietor of that !
sheet ask me to take charge of his
fight for Governor; to get the delega
tion of this city to support him for the ;
Democratic nomination and also later ;
to have him appointed and elected
United States Senator?
"It was during the period, from 1880
to IS9O that the organization of which >
I was a member was a grand one. I
was all right then. I was continually
doing these favors for Mr. Hearst In :
1890, when 1 refused to do what I con
sidered dishonorable and since which
time I have been out of politics, I be- I
came this very bad man. During that j
time, from 1882 to 1891, when, according
to that paper I was in control of the !
Democratic organization, this city was
better governed than it was before or
has been since. If I was the bad man
they represent me to be why did they
come to me time and again and accept
my money to keep their paper going; I
why did they pet me to settle their libel
suitâ help get its proprietor the :
nomination for Governor?
"They say I am in the employ of j
Huntington. That's a lie! I am not in i
the employ of Mr. Huntington and have |
never been. But it Is well known to
every resident of this community that
a short time ago the Examiner was in
the employ of Mr. Huntington, under a
contract of one thousand dollars a
month for thirty months. And I want j
to say right here that that is not the
only time to my knowledge that the j
Examiner sold out to Mr. Huntington.
"In that article they say I was fined
$."00 in a contempt proceding before
the Supreme Court. That is another
malicious lie. The record shows that a
majority of that court saw through the
conspiracy and exonerated me by dis
missing the proceeding.
"Now as to this Wallace Grand Jury.
That is the great conspiracy they are
in the habit 'if Haunting every few
day to the public. In connection with
that matter I want to state that Wil
liam T. Wallace asked me to have him
nominated In the Democratic conven- j
Hon for Superior Judge, which I did.
and he was elected. At the San Jose
convention in 1890 he was a candidate
for the nomination of Chief Justice of
ji
the Supreme Court. He was defeated
in the convention and he attributed his
defeat to me and he swore in the pres
ence of his colleagues on the bench that
he would be revenged on me. In IS9I
he formed what was known as the
Wallace Grand Jury, which was in op
position to the law he had laid down
while Justice of the Supreme Court "of
this State, and which we all know was
I set aside by that tribunal.
"That so-called Grand Jury found
' what they called an indictment against
I me for something I had no more to do
j with than the man in the moon had.
; A man by the name of Mayne tried to
i interest me in a scheme to obtain a
railroad franchise from the Board of
Supervisors, and I refused to have any
thing to do with it. His attorney, who is
now a resident of this city, also asked
me to interest myelf and I gave him the
very same answer. I also advised my
friends on the Board of Supervisors
j to have nothing to do with it. In No-
I vember, 1890, I left for Europe. In
i December of that same year or just be-
I fore the expiration of the term of that
j Board of Supervisors, and at a time
j when 1 was seven thousand milesaway,
PRIZES AWARDED TO
SUCCESSFUL TURNERS
THE seventeenth biennial fes
tival of the Pacific Turn Bezirk
came to a close at an early
hour this morning at Turner
Hall, with the last strains of
"Home, Sweet Home." The last,
flay was a long one. crowded with
events from the assembly at 7 o'clock
yesterday morning till the last step in
the last dance on the programme began
last evening, but not a Turner in the
district and not one of his friends
who begrudged one of the many
hours spent.
The weather conditions were much
better than on the preceding day and
the sixty odd athletes entered in the
various events went at their work
with a will. In the amphitheater the
men continued their feats of the day
before on the horizontal bar. They
jumped, high and broad, they went
hand over hand tip the rope and they
sprinted, In the barn they finished
before noon on the apparatus.
Popular interest in the festival
reached its highest pitch during the
afternoon, when the wrestlers went
on the mat in "the Barn." Eight
athletes representing the Eintracht
and San Francisco vereins of this city
and the Oakland and Sacramento
vereins were entered to contest for
the- laurel wreath and diploma that
constituted the first and second prizes.
Before the bouts began the Impres
sion had gained ground that William
Oechsle of the Verein Eintracht would
down all comers. The Sacramento
contingent, however, which was out
for blood, was confident it had a r^ni
in William Noething who would give
the Eintracht's representative a tussle
for the place. As after events proved
the Sacramentans were wiser than
they knew.
The first bout was a short, sharp
Struggle between Fred Ottinger of the
San Francisco Turn Verein and Her
man Haustein of the Eintracht. Hau
stein won by very clever work.
Oechsle, the champion of the Ein
tracht, then appeared to try conclu
sions with Louis Trost of tu< San
Franclscos. His appearance was the
signal for prolonged cheering. The
Eintracht wrestler showed a larger
amount of muscle than his opponent,
and went at his work in a way to show
that he was a practiced hand. He was
in no hurry to throw his man, but he
showed a confidence and a skill that
were too much for Trost, who soon
went on his shoulders.
The Sacramento dark horse, Noeth
ing, was pitted against Ernest Rehor
of the Oakland Verein. He heightened
the hopes of his admirers by his work
manlike manner of going at his oppo
nent, and soon put him hors de combat
with a half Nelson.
The succeeding bout between Joe
Myers and Arthur Hluniel of the San
Francisco Turn Verein was a clever
exhibition in a class all by itself, Blu
mel finally losing to his opponent, who
threw him once more for luck. After
a slight Intermission the champions
came together to determine the ques-

I this franchise was passed.
"Had they indicted the Examiner or
the people who were running it they
would have been pretty near correct.
Mr. Mayne afterward informed me that
he had a contract with that paper for
j printing and advertising for $12,500 and
a part of that contract called for the
Examiner's aid in the passage of the
franchise and having the Mayor sign

tion of supremacy. They were both of
a size. Oechsle looking to be the finer
trained and more muscular of the two.
Northing showed a large amount of
beef, but before the bout had proceeded
many seconds it was seen that this did
not impede his movements. Oechsle
appeared to be confident of the out
come, while Noething showed signs of
wariness that betrayed a fear of his
opponent.
The San Franciscan was on the ag
gressive from the start and many
times during the next ten minutes had
his opponent apparently on the hip,
only to lose him. The Sacramentan
had a trick, when too tightly pressed,
bj crawling off the mat. whereupon
the referee would make the men
break. This maneuver met with the
disapproval of Oechsle's supporters,
who claimed that Noething should
have been disqualified. He was not,
however, and after breaking half a
dozen more of the holds of his oppo
nent, put Oechsle over and down with
a neatly executed crotch and arm
hold. _ .
The applause was deafening and the
excitement so great that it took ten
i.i i tit before the crowd cooled down
enough to enjoy the dance, which had
been interrupted before the bouts.
Following the wrestling came the
fencing. In which the various contest
ants showed remarkable skill. The

want to return to the conditions- of
government which this same unholy
Examiner alliance gave to this city
three years ago, which is fresh in the
minds of the people? They remember
the action of that infamous Board of
School Directors, which, according to
all the public prints, violated their
pledges to the people by charging large
sums for new text books and raising
the salary list $230,000. The Supervisors
then were Interviewed about the tax
levy, according to the newspapers, and
their, ideas were that a levy of $2 50 on
a JIOO valuation was the least that they
could run the government with. Mayor
Phelan turned them out of office and
recommended a reputable lot of gentle
men in their stead, who while in office
prepared a tax levy of $1 25 on a $100
valuation, which was copied by these
fellows at the meeting they held in the
corridors, of the City Hall, and which
officially became the tax levy, thereby
saving to the people an enormous sum
of money.
"Now if Democrats want to return
to this sort of government let them
vote for the delegate ticket submitted
to them by the Examiner and its un
holy alliance. The Examiner has been
villifying and blackguarding every per
son who comes in these headquarters
in a language known only to the in
mates of the hovel in which it is ground
out."

MIDNIGHT DUEL
IN IN ELLIS
STREET SALOON
"Jack" Wilson Got
His Man.
â â¦ â
WALTER CAVANAUGH KILLED
â Â»
HE WAS NOT QUICK ENOUGH
WITH HIS GUN.
â¦
Quarrel Over the Disreputable Sister
of the Dead Man, Who Was
the Mistress of His
Slayer.
Walter Cavanaugh. a young man well
known in the tenderloin, was shot and
killed by Jack Wilson shortly after mid
night this morning in the saloon of C. G.
Borgfeldt on the northwest corner of
Mason and Ellis streets. Three bullets en
tered his body and he died almost in
stantly. Wilson was arrested a few
minutes later by Officer Harrigan while
standing on the corner with the smoking
revolver still in his hand.
The quarrel which resulted in the kill
ing was by all accounts the second the
parties had during the day. Wilson has
been living with a sister of Cavanaugh at
5 Latham place, a small cul de sac off
Mason street in the rear of Borgfeidt's
saloon.
As nearly as can be ascertained, Cava
naugh had been living off the profits of
his sister's degradation. The relation
ship of Wilson with Miss Cavanaugh, it
is said, interfering as it did with the
money supply of Cavanaugh, gave rise
to flip Quarrel.
Cavanaugh in a drunken condition
called yesterday afternoon about 6 o'clock
at the residence of his sister and Wilson.
He had been there but a short time when
the neighbors heard two pistol shots and
saw the woman run out on the porch,
calling upon her brother to come out and
go away.
Mrs. M. A. Carson and her son. Thomas.
who reside at 3 Latham place, heard two
shots. Half an hour later they saw
Cavanaugh reel down the alley to the
street alone. Miss Laura Graham of 1 ;
Latham place also saw Cavanaugh take j
his departure. ..'â¢'. j
About 12:30 o'clock this morning, while
Borgfeldt was closing the door of his
grocery, he heard men's voices as if
raised in quarrel coming from the side
walk. He next heard the saloon doors
open and the men come in.
"Have you a gun?" Borgfeldt heard
pome one exclaim. The next Instant
shots rang out. The saloon man thinks
there were four.
Instead of entering the saloon, he ran
out to the sidewalk through the door of
the grocery, where he saw Wilson stand
ing, with a revolver in hand. Officer Har
rigan. who was on Ellis street and heard
the shots, came up in a moment and
placed Wilson under arrest. The pris
oner told the policeman that he shot in
self-defense.
Inside the saloon door, lying in a pool
of gore, with fragments of glass all about
him, lay the dead man. His features were
Indistinguishable.
A revolver belonging to the dead man
was lying beside him, having fallen from
his grasp as the bullets struck him. Three
chambers were empty, another contained
an exploded cartridge shell and the fourth
an unexploded bullet, bearing out the the
ory that Cavanaugh had fired one if not
the first shot in the quarrel.
The pistol Wilson had when arrested
contained three exploded cartridges.
Stonewall Bailey, a bartender, was with
Wilson when he killed Cavanaugh.
"We were standing at the corner of
Ellis and Mason streets," he remarked,
"engaged in conversation. I saw Cava
naugh approaching us and, knowing the
bitter feeling that existed between the
men, I advised Wilson to watch him
closely.
"Just then Cavanaugh, who was accom
panied by another man, named "Wallace, I
think, accosted Wilson, and, drawing a
revolver, asked him if he was heeled.
"Wilson replied that he did not want to
fcave any trouble and advised Cavanaugh
to put up his gun.
"Cavanaugh raised his revolver as if to
shoot, when his friend grabbed him and
attempted to take the weapon away from
him.
"Wilson at this juncture started to enter
the saloon on the corner and was quickly
followed by Cavanaugh. The latter still
â  held his gun In his hand and again level
ing it at Wilson fired.
"Wilson immediately drew hft revolver
and fired three shots at Cavanaugh, in
stantly killing him."
Wilson was arrested immediately after
the killing and taken to the City Prison.
lie gave his age as 35 years and his oc
-1 cupation as that of a bartender. He was
1 pale and excited and begged to be given
a drink of whisky.
Jack Wallace, who was with Cavanaugh
at the time of the shooting, disappeared
j immediately after.
| When questioned about the killing Wil
son declared that he did not want to dis
cuss the crime until he had consulted an
attorney.
"When the proper time comes." he re
marked, "I will show that I acted In self
| defense. If I had not shot Cavanaugh he
I would have sent me to the Morgue. It is
i ! true that I have been living with his sis
' ter, but she had nothing to do with the
t j shooting."

CRUSHED HER HAND.
Miss Theresa Schoopkin Received Se
vere Injuries in a Printing House.
Miss Theresa Schoopkin, who resides
with her family at 317 Green street, met
with an accident yesterday which is like
ly to result in the loss of her right hand.
The young lady is employed by the Stu
parich Manufacturing Company at 141
Fremont street, and was engaged in ope
rating a press which prints labels on pa
per boxes. In some manner her fingers
became entangled in the large rollers and
before assistance could reach her the ma
chinery had frightfully lacerated her
hand. All possible attention was given
the unfortunate girl and she was hastily
taken to the Harbor Receiving Hospital,
where Dr. Thompson dressed the injured
member. He was obliged to' take nearly
fifty stitches in the flesh, and at present
he expresses his doubts whether the hand
can be saved. Miss Schoopkin is about 20
years of age.

MINNIE ADAMS
IS GUILTY OF
CHILD MURDER
The Degenerate Poi
soned Her Baby.
Mrs. Minnie Adams has been convicted
of the murder of her infant son. John
Richard Gray. That she will not walk to
the gallows is due alone to the sympathy
of the twelve good men and true whs ;
passed judgment upon her. They have ,
fixed the' penalty for the crime at im- ,
prisonment for life.
Saturday morning at 11 o'clock the fate
of the murderess was placed in the hands
of the Jury. After an hour's discussion of
the facts of the case a ballot was taken,
and it is said that nine condemned her for
the crime while three stood for her inno
cence. Another discussion followed, and
the second ballot found but one man,
Juror Mehrtens. favorable to the accused.
Then the work of, bringing this juror to
a belief in the prisoner's guilt began. At j
6 o'clock he had not wavered, and Judge
Lawlor ordered the jury locked up for the
night. Sunday morning came, and still
he voted for acquittal. The jury was sent
back for further deliberation, and again
at 1 o'clock was called into the court
room. Foreman Manning stated that the
lone juror simply sat mute and discussion
of the case had ended. Again the jury
was sent back, and at 6 o'clock the same
scene was enacted. . Again the jury went !
back, and at 3 o'clock Monday morning j
Judge Lawlor was informed that the jury j
wanted certain testimony read. Judge j
Lawlor hurried to the courtroom, and then
it was made known that Attorney Mack,
who represented the accused, had left the j
city leaving Judge A. D. Lemon to watch I
the interests of his client. The city was
scoured for Lemon without avail, and i
finally Attorney W. W. Davidson, whose
address was near the court, was appoint- >
ed by Judge Lawlor to represent the ac
cused. Mr. Davidson consented to repre
sent the murderess after the condition of
affairs had been explained to him. Mrs.
Adams also gave her consent to the sub
stitution of counsel, and the jury filed in. I
It was only upon one point that Mr. Mehr
tens hungâ the point as to whether Har- j
| rison Tyrrell, the young brother of the
' accused,, had testified as to there being :
I carbolic acid, or any. liquid, in the bottle
: he found, from which' the poison was sub- â¢
1 sequently poured down the baby's throat, i
The testimony showed that there was not j
! any liquid in the bottle when it was j
j found, and a further reading developed |
I the fact that after Mrs. Adams threw it
| out of the window, after the baby's death,
; there was a quantity of poison left there- |
1 in. This was all the evidence sought. The i
I reading occupied until 3:45 o'clock,, and j
j half an hour later the bell announced
that a verdict had been reached.
Mrs. Adams was brought into court, and
her mother, Mrs. Kelly, and her brother,
John Tyrrell, were seated near. Fore
man Manning rose in response to the
question of the clerk as to whether or not
a verdict had been reached and said:
"We, the jury, find the defendant, Minnie j
j Adams, guilty of murder in the first de
gree, and lix and assess her punishment _
at confinement in the State's prison for
life. So say we all." Then he continued: I
"We all regret the painful duty that has |
been thrust upon usâ the painful duty of
passing judgment upon this woman for a |
crime that necessitates such a severe sen
tence. But it was our duty and we have I
obeyed the law." Judge Lawlor bowed |
and the juror took his seat. â¢
In the meantime Mrs. Adams remained I
mute, not a shadow of emotion crossing j
I her face. Judge Lawlor set August 19 as
the date of sentence, and then informed i
the bailiff to take the jurors to an early j
breakfast and when all had been satisfied |
to procure conveyances and see them to I
their homes. The court further thanked I
the jurors for the attention they gave the
; case and for their thorough deliberation
WHY "BRICK"
McPHERSON IS
VERY ANGRY
Cannot Get His Bail
Reduced.
"Brick" McPherson and Thomas J.
Clisham appeared before Judge Treadwell
yesterday for their preliminary examina
tion on the felony charge of obtaining
money by false pretenses. Prosecuting
Attorney Carpenter asked for a continu
ance till to-morrow afternoon, as the po
lice desired more time to get their evi
dence.
Attorney Harvey S. Brown, who repre
sents McPherson, objected strongly to a
continuance and .wanted the case gone on
with at once. His client had been a long
time in jail and was entitled to an im
mediate hearing.
Attorney J. N. E. Wilson then took a
hand in the argument, and asked that
McPherson's bail be reduced to $1000. He
said the defendant could get bondsmen to
that amount.
The Judge refused to reduce the bail
and made an order continuing the cases
till to-morrow. McPherson was very an
gry when taken back to the City Prison,
and remarked: "I guess they have all gone
back on me. Why should all these dubs
stay outside while I am in? Wait awhile;
I will say a few things in a day or so.
Clisham's walking around, air it he?
It was reported yesterday that Clisham
will be a witness for the prosecution
when McPherson's case come , up for. pre
liminary hearing. He insists that he was
an innocent victim in the conspiracy, and
in consideration of his testimony against
"Brick" he will, it la said, be ultimately
discharged from custody. is still play-
Saloon-keener E. N. Smoot is still plaj -
ing peek-a-boo with the police. Attorney
Madden who represents htm. said yester
day that Smoot was keeping under cover
till he could get sufficient bonds and
would surrender himself by to-night at
the latest It was rumored yesterday that
he had disposed of his saloon business on
I arkin and McAllister streets and would
shake the dust of San Francisco from his
fret but this was denied by his friends.
Walter Berry, alias Emert, the other man
in the swindle, has not been heard of. The
police have been unable to find any trace
of him.
before passing judgment that means so
much to the now condemned murderess.
This through. Judge Lawlor left the
bench and with a deputy sheriff on either
side Mrs. Adams left the court. On reach
ing the corridor a realization of her posi
tion came over her for the first time and
she swooned away. Her brother hurried
into the courtroom and procured water,
and soon she was able to resume her jour
ney to her cell. * *
