INSANE MAN SHOT DOWN BY
NEGRO SOLDIERS,
A Cold-Biooded Murder Is Committed
at Wardner in the Name of
Martial Law.
WALLACE, Idaho. Jinx- 10. â A prisoner named Johnson, confined in. the bull pen at
y\ 'arduer, yesterday became violently insane. A few days ago he was examined be-
fore the Coroner's secret inquest. Since that time he has been under the hallucination
that he would soon be hanged unless he identified some of the . men supposed to have partici
pated in the riot of April jo. hi his ravings he frequently begged to be saved from the fate
which he believed awaited him.
Last night Probate Judge McKinlay went to Wardner to inquire into the man's sanity.
To-day an examining board of physicians declared him insane and' Judge McKinlay ordered
him committed to the asylum. v â  â¢

Coroner France, having the patient in charge, left the penitentiary a few moments be
fore the east-bound train passed through Wardner intending to take him to Wallace, the
county seat. While waiting the arrival of the train the unfortunate man started to run.
He was fired upon by four negro soldiers and his body fell
into the Coeur d'Alene River.
Coroner France is reported to have said that he ordered the soldiers to fire high. The
greatest indignation prevails, and both the Coroner and the military are censured by the entire
population for what is universally regarded 'as a cold-blooded murder and one of the most
inhuman and cowardly act- yet perpetrated in the name of martial law.

LONDON, June 10.â Affairs in the
Transvaal were the one absorb-
ing topic of conversation during
the week. On Wednesday many
alarming rumors were in circulation,
most of which, however, had evident
ly been manufactured in this city for
financial purposes.
One of .the most circumstantial of
the rumors was to the effect that
President Kruger had been given
three months to meet the views of
the British Government, and that
failing recurrence to war would be
declared.
While such stories obtained no cre
dence among well-informed people,
there was no doubt that great anx
iety existed in Government circles as
to the outcome of the conference be
tween Kruger and Sir Alfred Milner.

LONDON, June 10.â When the Secre
tary of State for the Colonies, Joseph
Chamberlain, in the House of Commons
on Thursday summed up the result of
the Bloemfontein conference by declar
ing that "a new situation has been cre

apparently to a variety of Inter

one. The politicians who have closely

the Colonial Secretary plainly meant to
declare that by means of these open

High Commission, Sir Alfred Milner,

of the matters in dispute, it had been

BE MURDERED
Weird Summons of H. K.
Beldin, Well-Known In-
surance Man Here.
ATTACKED WITH AX
Luckily t the Capitalist Escaped.
Two Men Arrested for the
Crimeâ A Dark Mystery.
One of the most mysteri
ous outrages ever attempt
ed in the ban cities was
perpetrated last night on
11. A. Belden, manager of
the Hartford Insurance
Company, (it his Oakland'
residence. He was lured
downstairs bu word of an
important message, and
when he appeared at the
door was attacked with an
ax wielded by an un
known miscreant. The af
fair is shrouded in mys
tery. Mr. Held en denies
all Icnowldedge of any mo
tive for the crime and is
happy, apparently, that
lie escaped by a miracle.
Two arrests have been
made, but the police are
apparently as ma eh mys
tified as the would-be vic
tim of the foul attack.
OAKLAND. Juno 10.â A most fiendish
attempt was made late to-night to mur
der H. K. Belden in his own doorway.
About 11:40 o'clock- a stranger rang
the bell and was answered from up
stairs by Mr. Belden. The stranger
said that he had a. telegram for Mr.
Belden. and the latter said he would
come down.
As soon as Mr. Belden opened the
door tin- stranger struck at him with
an ax. Mr. Belden at once drew back,
and as he was closing the door the
would-be assassin's ax passed over his
arm and he was struck with the
handle. The ax wielder then ran off
and the police were called.
Two suspects were arrested, but Cap
tain Peterson Bays he has not much
faith that either of them is the man
wanted. Mr. Belden is a capitalist and
lives in a fine mansion on Lake street.
H. K. Belden is manager of the Hart
ford Insurance Company In San Fran
cisco and resides in Oakland. He has
always been considered a man of great
ability and of quiet and regular habits.
Mr. Belden 'a account of the attempted
assassination is as follows:
"I had just retired, when I
heard a sharp ring at the front
door. I opened the window upstairs
and saw- a man standing on the porch.
He told me to come down, as he had
an important dispatch for me.. I slip
ped on my dressing-gown, went down
stairs and threw the front door wide
open and put out my hand to receive
the message. instead of a message I
saw a big ax in the hands of the man.
The fellow did not say a word, but
lifted the ax and made a violent stroke
at me. When I saw what he was do
ing I proceeded to shut the door as
fast as possible. This caused the handle
of the ax to strike my arm, and the
force of the blow was so great that
when it struck me the ax Hew out of the
fellow's hand Into the hall.
"The man immediately ran from my
doorway without saying a word. I
then called for the police and put them
in possession of the facts and the ax.
The would-be assassin was a stranger
to me and I have not the remotest idea
why he should wish to murder me."
The ax is an ordinary Implement of
the woodchopper's style. Had the blow
landed there is no doubt that it would
have severed Mr. Belden'a head. Two
men who were in the neighborhood at
the time of the assault were arrested
a few minutes later and are now in
prison. The ax-wielder hail chosen his
time carefully, as the policeman on that
beat had just gone off duty for a half
hour to get his dinner.
COMMERCIAL COMPACT
QUESTION. IS SETTLED
VIENNA, June 10.â A conference vof
Austrian and Hungarian Ministers to-day
settled the ausgleich, or economic com-
mercial compact question, on the basis of
a compromise, the details of which will be
announced in the Hungarian Diet on
Wednesday next.
The Weiner Allegemeine Zeltung says it
: learns that after the falling through of
th, renewal of the ausgleich two solutions
seemed possible to the Governmentâ the
retention of the whole ausgleich. Includ
ing the prolongation of the Austro-Hun-'
garlan Bank charter until 1903, or the con-
tinuance of the whole ausgleich under the
new statute. until 1903.
A further proposal, excluding the pos
sibility of the maintenance of the bank
after the expiration of the customs and
commercial union, was considered.. Which
plan, if any, will' be adopted will not be
known until Premier Koloman do Szell
makes his statement to the Diet. *
According to the Neve Frele Presse the
compromise provided for the duration of
the customs and commercial union and
the Austro-Hungarian charter until 1907.
The new constitution of the bank will be
carried out Immediately and the commer

1903 will be renewed to run until the end
of 1907. so that they may expire at the

REAR ADMIRAL JOHN G. WALKER.
COMMISSION
CHOSEN BY
PRESIDENT
Will Soon Begin. lts Work,
Which Will Cover a
Wide Scope.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, June 10.âSec
retary Hay has announced
these members of the com
mission selected by the Presi-
dent to determine the most
feasible and practicable route for a
canal across the isthmus of Panama:
Hear- Admiral John G. Walker, retired;
Samuel Pas-. of Florida; Alfred Noble,
civil engineer, of 'Illinois; George S.
Morrison; civil engineer, of New York;
Colonel Peter C. Haines, U. S. A.; Pro
fessor William H. Burr of Connecticut;
Lieutenant Colonel Oswald H. 'Ernst,
U. S. A.; Lewis M. Haupt, civil en
gineer, of Pennsylvania, and Professor
Emery R. Johnson of Pennsylvania.
There are, therefore, nine members of
the commission instead of seven, as
originally proposed. As a whole the
commission is regarded as very satis
factory. All of its members are in fa
vor of the construction of a canal
across the isthmus, and, unless certain
usually informed civil engineers in
Washington are misinformed, they will
be favorable to the Nicaraguan canal,
though inquiry may change the minds
of some of the Commissioners.
It was said at the State Department
to-day that no date had been fixed for
the organization of the commission.
Rear Admiral Walker, chairman of the
new commission, will see the' President
early next week, and will discuss the
date of meeting, which will be within
a short time, and the. commission will
then receive its formal instructions
from the President.
Immediately after organization and
the selections of a corps of assist
ants, and when the Commissioners have
had an opportunity to settle their pri
vate affairs, they will sail from , New.
York on a regular passenger steamer
for Colon and will commence at once
the examination of the Panama route,
subsequently proceeding to Nicaragua.
In some quarters there is a disposition.
to believe that the commission's work
will cover at least two years, but it is
the desire of the President that the
commission shall submit a report dur
ing the next session of Congress, in or
der that action may tl|en be taken
which will result in the construction of
the canal. '
The commission will be a very experts
sive body, and it is estimated to-day
that each member will receive a salary
at the rate of about $10,000 a year. me
million dollars has been appropriated
for the work. A secretary will be
elected, a corps of surveyors and expert
canal men, numbering about 100, will
be employed to assist the commission.
Three of the membersâ Rear Admiral
Walker, Colonel Haines and Mr. Haupt
were members of the Nicaragua Ca
nal Commission which submitted its re
port to the President a few weeks ago.
- Former Senator Pasco's appointment.
is in compliance with ' the pressure.
brought to bear by the South, which is
deeply interested in the canal question
and* earnestly in favor of the construc
tion of a waterway as early as possi
ble. While in the Senate Mr. Pasco was
an ardent advocate of the canal.
Mr. Noble served as a member of
the Ludlow Canal Commission, the pre..
decessor of the Walker Commission.
Mr. Morrison is best known in New
York, where he resides. His specialty
is bridge engineering, and ho is also
employed on large works as consulting
engineer. He and Professor Burn were
members of the commission appointed
to consider the Improvement of the
water front of New York harbor. '
Professor Burr is a graduate- of the
Troy Polytechnic Institute and now
holds a professorship in Columbia Col
lege of New York.
Professor Johnson is a member of
the faculty of the University of Penn
sylvania. The President feels that th
commercial side of the canal question
is most important, and his selection of
Professor Johnson is in response to the
wishes, of many commercial organiza
tions. -â  .. t .

POWERFUL OPPOSITION
TO NICARAGUA CANAL
PHILADELPHIA, June .10.â A re- ;
markable criticism was made to-day in
connection with the Nicaraguan Canal
project by Lewis M. Haupt, one of the j
two Philadelphia members of -the new
Commission just appointed , by. â¢ Presi
dent McKinley.
"The appointment of this commis
sion." said Mr. Haupt, "is' simply an
other game of procrastination brought
about by the allied' opposition to the
United States getting possession' of . a
' short route to the Far East. This op
position is powerful and active. It
never rests, and when you come to an-
I alyze it it is enough to make one de-
spair.
"To begin with, there is a technical
commission composed of English.
French, German and other engineers
who made their headquarters here last
year. Then there is the transconti
nental railway opposition, who believe
the canal would hurt their business.
This is a mistake on their part, as deep
waterways always increase the busi
; ness of railways.
. "Then there is the Panama Canal in
terest. The 'millions that have been
squandered on that scheme and the
general impracticability of it are mat
ters of common knowledge. No French
man can be found to invest a penny
in it. Bui the company which now
controls it .bought it for a song and
wiped out alb former obligations, and
is working upon it to-day. Tin? Gov

STOCKTON, June 11. â A rumor was circulated on the streets of this
city at about midnight last night to the effect that the steamer T. C.
Walker had exploded a boiler or steam drum after passing Antioch on
the way to Stockton. Neither the source nor a verification of. the rumor
could be secured, nor could word be had of the steamer's trip up the

year out of it, and it is to their interest
to keep the work going. But the great
game is to saddle the Panama Canal
onto the United Statesâ is, to
make this country pay for' it, for
France will always want the canal if it
should ever be built.
"Then there is England. She is only
one of the European nations, but her
trade with the Far East is great and
she fears she will lose it if the Nica
ragua Canal is opened. England has
to-day the heir apparent of the Mos
quito country held as a hostage in Ja
maica. She' pays him an annuity, and
ever since the Clayton-Bulwer treaty
she has been trying to get possession
of the country.
"English capitalists have tried a
number of times to get control of the
San Juan River solely to prevent the
building -of the canal. The Clayton-
Bulwer treaty itself is the greatest ob
stacle to the building of the Nicaraguan
Canal and was drafted in the interests
of English trade.
' "Now this commission is composed of
some of the ablest men in the country.
In fact you have thrashed all the wheat
but. of. this thing already. They have
been down there and spent two years
and a lot of money. They have made
an elaborate report, bat who has ever
seen it? If that report were published.
as it ought to be,, the people would
know by this time why the canal is not
building. The commission will go down
again, spend another, two years, and
the same old story will be told. The
opposition is too powerful."
WIDE SCOPE OF THE
COMMISSION'S WORK
â¢ WASHINGTON. June 10.â Besides
the Nicaragua and Panama routes, the
new Isthmian Canal Commission will
determine the practicability of a canal
across the isthmus of Darien.
It Is proposed to place a couple of
small surveying parties on this route,
one probably to commence work at
Darien harbor and the other at Cale
donia Bay. While none of the Com
missioners, so far as I have been able
to learn.. have any faith in the Darien
route, it is deemed advisabel to con
sider every canal. route that has been
suggested in order that when the work
is done the commission cannot be
charged with failure to examine the en
tire question. Rear-Admiral Walker,
president of the commission, is endeav
oring to call for an early meeting of
the commission, and it is expected the
first session will be held the week after
next. The views of each Commissioner
as to contract of work will then be
sought and arrangements made for an
immediate start. The Panama canal
route will be first surveyed, and the
commission will then proceed to Nicar
agua. â¢ It is understood that small par
ties will be placed on the Nicaraguan
route in order to complete the very full
data obtained 'by the late Nicaraguan
Canal Commission.2
VALE THE DEPARTED
KING OF THE RING!
INQUEST
OVER DEAD
CHAMPION
" Greatest Fighter of . His
Weight That Ever
Lived the Verdict.
OPINIONS OF SPORTS
Believe Fitzsimmons Suffered More
in the Clinches Than From
Blows Received.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, June 10.â They buried
Fitzsimmons to-dayâ game and shifty
Kangarooâ and then they held an Inquest
and went into the evidence. The greatest
man of his weight who ever entered the
ring had been put away, a new fistic king
had arisen, and sporting men began to
ask themselves why and how he did it.
And looking soberly back at the strug
gle, free from smoke, excitement and the
roar of a great battle, there were many"
who said flatly that the former cham
pion was not so much outfought as he
was wearied and borne down by the sheer
weight with which the giant boiler-maker
hung upon his neck whenever they
clinched.
As the rules go, it was a clean fight,
and no one wished to take a tithe from
the credit due the mammoth boy who
faced an unbeaten champion and put him
down and out.* But men recalled that
from time to time during the middle
rounds, when Jeffries was clearly tired,
he clung to Fitzsimmons in clinches and
wore him down by simple bulk. There was
never a clinch from which Fitzsimmons
did not go away some pounds worse for
the hugging; and thus, as the game
went on, he began to lack steam, and his
legsâ spindle legs which have been the
wonder of the fighting worldâ began to
tremble. And. however good his bead and
arms may be, the man whose legÂ« lack
their strength and spring is beaten, bar
ring always a chance blow.
There were always weight and youth
against the Australian. In terrific rushes
or when Jeffries ducked a swing, his head
or shoulders shot against Fitzsimmons'
ribs with tremendous force. That hap
pened again and again, and often in
clinches Jeffries leaned his full weight
upon his opponent, and Fitzsimmonsâ
thoroughbred fighter that he lost
steam and strength every time it oc
curred.
And Fitzsimmons was conceding thir
teen years and fifty pounds in weight to
a man trained to a nicety and coached
by "Tommy" Ryan, who knows too much
of the Cornishman's style of fighting not
to be dangerously useful to his principal.
There were hundreds of men to-day who
could tell you all about it and who hailed
Jeffries as the "greatest ever," â¢ but no
two men in fifty told the same story of
the critical periods of the contest, al
though the majority of them agreed upon
thisâ that the boiler-maker's mighty bulk
wore Fitzsimmcns out more than, did all
the punishment the blacksmith received
before the ninth or tenth round.
By thai time the odds were smiting. The
youth of the Californian. his great recu
perative powers and the absence of any
serious injury left his legs steady and hut
head clear as he went to his corner. But
Fitzsimmons. who I id really been mauled
more than pounded up to the last of the
eighth, was wearied, and while his game
ness and his tempi life made him. a
marvelous man (or his age, at such' a
stage of the game his speed and strength
were on the ebb. .1 '-'â  ; â -".'-.
Great ring general as he was, he seemed
to neglect to follow up striking advan
tages from time to time and he was per
ceptibly weak when Jeffries roughed it a
bit. And it was then the crowd, demand
ing fair play regardless of its favorites,
shouted wildly for Jeffries to break and
fight hands free. The boiler maker had
used only legitimate tactics, but thou
sands about the rlnc realized in an in
stant that by hanging his weight upon
the Cornishman's neck and shoulders he
was wearing him down, and they pre
ferred to see the men break quickly and
have the trick done by' science rather than
weight.
Jeffries after the first round surprised
every one by the ease with which he hit
the champion. And when he did land
there was always a driving force of 21J
pounds behind the blow. But Fitzsim
monsâ as game as they make themâ
stand punishment proper better than he
could bear up under the fatigue of
clinches.
Thousands watched that small bald
head fringed scantily by red hair and
said to themselves that Fitzsimmons
would do the trick yet.- The blue eyes
were ever steady and alert and as fierce
as the punishment was. The game old
man followed the giant about, always try
ing to coax down his peculiar guard and
rend In ope smashing blow which would
end it It was not to be. for Jeffries, who
had been prepared wonderfully well, had
a head on him which kept him from the
dangers of over-confidence at one moment
and confusion following punishment at
the next. He could wait, which was a
great thing in itself, and he could afford
to wait, which was a matter of still
greater Importance.
No one, unless It be Fitzsimmons him
self, . knew how desperate his chances
were by the end of the eighth, when an
unexpected rally by Jeffries jolted him

END OF THE PURSE
Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars
the Remuneration for a
Pummeling.
"I TEW YORK, June 10:â From a financial standpoint the big fight
\ was the most successful affair of its kind ever held in this coun-
NEW The gate receipts amounted $65,000. Of this sum the fight
was the most successful affair of its kind ever held in this coun-
try. The gate receipts amounted to $65,000. Of this sum the light-
Jj-.J ers divided $40,000, Fitzsimmons' share being $25,000 and Jeffries'
$15,000. It seems strange that the loser should receive more than
the winner, but Fitzsimmons refused to make the match- unless he was
guaranteed the winner's share. The former champion felt so confident
of success that he insisted on a very large certainty in the way of money
before he signed articles. As he was the champion he, of course, had
the right to dictate terms, and Jeffries, in order to obtain an opportu
nity to win the championship of the world, was compelled to concede
everything to Fitzsimmons.
Many persons were surprised when they heard to-day that Fitzsim
mons got the bulk of the purse money. They thought that as Jeffries had
won, he naturally would receive the greatest financial remuneration.
William A. Brady, Jeffries' manager, who is really responsible for the
match between Fitzsimmons and Jeffries, said that he was obliged to
give Fitzsimmons all his 'own way in order to make the match.

A great many people have the idea
that I am forever lost to the pugi

phrase expresses it better than the old i
oneâ "He died game." The legs which
had carried him to victory or to safety so
often were wobbling, but few would have ;
guessed it from the look in the Cornish- ,
man's eye or the set of his head as he |
shaped up. But Jeffries knew. He had j
been told that his opponent's only chance i
lav in a single blow, and he guarded well
against that. With his handy left .and
his strong guard he met the champion s
tush, and punished him and hugged him
Into weakness.
The remaining two rounds were simply a
slaughter. The men will long remember ;
how Fitzsimmons, twice knocked down,
arose dazed and tottering, but with the
gamecock's courage, and made yet an
other bid against the fate which was com-
ing to him. Fighting such as this is not ;
an uplifting spectacle morally, but since ,
fighting to a finish was in order he cer
tainly deserved the admiration of the mad
thousands about him. Fitzsimmons was
galvanized into life by his seconds in the
minute preceding the last round., but it
was only to the end that he might go ,
gracefully to his finish, and gracefully to ;
his finish he went, and most men, how
ever they bet. were sorry. Say so much
for a crowd fighting mad. .
And now men ask. Who is the next man
in sight to go against Goliath? Sharkey,
of course. And he will have to meet a j
blester and stronger man, who holds mm
safe in the matter of strength, speed and
roughing it. and who has far better reach
and great advantage in height.
McCoy, some say, McCoy among them.
Well snorting men who saw Fitzsimmons
go Into oblivion wonder if McCoy could
dance away from the new champion long
enough to weary him. Therein, it would :
=eem would be the "Kid's". only chance. ]
Once the giant could corner him or weight |
him down, as he did Fitzsimmons, then
McCoy had better "get him to a nunnery.
The general opinion is that Fitzsimmons
has not gone back much and there was
only one Fitzsimmons. So it seems that
if Jeffries is as quick as he appeared dur-
ing much of Friday night's fight, he will
"rule the roost" until some one finds 200
pounds of rubber eager for money and
glory At the outset the new champion
appears like a modest, honest boy, and
while perforce, he takes to the footlights
immediately, there seems to be much hope
that he will come back to the ring un-
spoiled. . . Jk
A curious conversation occurred at the
A curious conversation occurred at the
ringside between "Billy" Brady and Chief
of Police Devery at Hie end of the tenth
round. The Chief sent for Brady and the ,
conversation Is quoted as follows:
"Here " said the Chief, "if he doesn't
finish his man in this round I'll have to
stop this thing on the score of brutality.
I thought it would be over In the tenth.
"All right, Chief,", was the answer; "I
guess he will finish Fitzsimmons In the
next one."
And he did.
The Chief was asked several times to-
day what he thought of the fight and why
he, who sat at the ringside and saw five
krock-downs and considerable gore, did
not stop the fight as lie had said he would.
"There was no occasion tp stop it," he
said. "It was a clean, scientific contest
and was within the. general construction
of the Horton law. The people seemed to
want it and now everybody is satisfied.
There was little damage done beyond
that Fitzsimmons had a bleeding nose and
Jeffries a slight cut over the eye. There
was no fouling, no hitting in the clinches; j
the men obeyed the referee and there was
no symptom of disorder among the spec
tators at any time." i>'-:'Â«:'ui
"But you said you would .stop the fight
at the first knock-down."
"Well," the Chief said, benevolently,
"it's all over now and everybody is con
tent. There's no use saying more about i
it It was a scientific contest. They com- I
plied with the law and there never was
any occasion for police Interference. It i
wasn't a brutal exhibition. Fitzsimmons
left the ring cheerful and won't be any j
the worse for it physically."
"Will you interfere in fighting contests i
In New York in the future?"
"Not if they comply, with the law, as |
was done at Coney Island."
"Then New York Is likely to become the '
pugilistic center of the United States?"
"1 don't know as to that. If it is so I
can't help it as long as the law is not vio- j
lated. 1 myself do not believe In ring con- :
tests where gate money Is charged. I'd !
like to see boxing bouts held only in clubs
and gymnasiums and conducted so that
young fellows who want to learn to box
would have the best chance. At Coney
Island there were no foul .tactics. The
men broke cleanly at the referee's order
and the men were scientific throughout, i
There Is absolutely no truth in the report
that mv attitude toward the fight was'
changed by the Interference of Brooklyn
politicians. "As for the knockout. Fitzsim-
mons might have become unconscious
after as much exertion from slipping and
falling. There was no violation or the
law. The people wanted the bout and now
it's over there's nothing more to be said
except that everybody appears to be sat
isfied." â 
The new President of France is not
absolutely without personal fortune, as
the stories which have been related of
him would lead one to believe. He pos
sesses about $100,000 ,or half a million
of francs, nearly all acquired by the
j practice of law.

'JEFFRIES'
PARENTS
PLEASED
Champion's Father Cannot
Hide His Joy Over the
Victory.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, June 10.â "I am not
given to talking about prizefights, and
I fear the public will not understand
me when I say that the Lord of Hosts
was in the battle of last night. Like
all other battles, this is a victory for
our Lord and Savior. My boy won it
because the Lord so willed it, and if he
had been defeated it would have been
through a power greater than we
know of."
Thus remarked the preacher father
i of "Jim" Jeffries, the world's heavy-
weight champion prizefighter when
j asked his opinion upon the result of
i the now celebrated contest. Notwith-
standing this reverential view of things
I earthy, the fact cannot be disguised
i that Mr. and Mrs. Jeffries, the brother
'< and three sisters are supremely happy
: that the big boy won the battle, and
j that the possibilities of defeat had
! caused serious reflection. All day the
! curious, idle and jubilant friends of the
family have crowded around and about
I the Jeffries home in East' Los Ange
| les.
Mrs. Jeffries has a strong face and
1 her eyes are striking in their brilliancy.
They twinkle slightly, but a straight
look from those orbs indicate that she
is weighing the object her gaze rests
upon and is fully "sizing up the situa
tion to form a mental conclusion. In
her dual relationship as the wife of a
! minister of the gospel and as the
mother of a champion pugilist, Mrs.
Jeffries exhibits the pride In which a
; mother's heart is engulfed; yet she ten
i derly respects the feelings that sway
her worthy and conscientious spouse.
"I opposed his going into this busi
ness," said the champion's mother,
"and succeeded in keeping him out
until he attained his majority. I have
always felt that 'Jim' would win, and
while it is difficult to speak about the
: subject in the position we occupy I
was sure he would defeat Fitzsimmons,
' because my boy is decent and clean in
\ this kind of business."
The fact that "Jim" might sustain
I some serious injury, or that some mis-
fortune might have overtaken fitz
simmons as a result of the battle, was
the source of much' concern to those
well-meaning and seriously good people.
Since they have heard the full results
of the contest, and that only incidental
and necessary bruises followed, a satis
faction has been added to the joy they
feel. - ; â¢ ;
If Jeffries Is like his father he will
prove a sturdy one, for the Rev. Mr.
Jeffries, with his flowing black hair
and his patriachal features, is devoted
i exclusively to and is Ixmnd up in his
i 1 religious work. It is one of his tenet's
j that a minister should accept nothing
i for his services, and He follows this be-
lief to the letter. Jeffries' brother,
! John, an especially agreeable young
j man and of athletic build, said:
"The folks didn't say much last night
. before the fight about 'Jim,' but they
were thinking about him just the same.
I said to father, just for fun, 'How
much money have you put upon Jim?'
" 'Don't you talk about betting on
Jim,' was his answer."
The Jeffries home is located on a
beautiful rise of ground on the East
Side, near the Arroyo Seco bridge.
There are about 100 acres in the place
and there for eighteen years the 'family
has resided. . The large, roomy house
is hidden among tall trees. Jeffries'
sisters have their flowers growing
about the house, and it scarcely ap
pears like a home of the champion
fighter of the world.
"But 'Jim' loves it better than all the
rest of the United States," said John,
"and he likes his Los Angeles friends
better than all others. He wrote us
that he would get back here before the
month was over. I think he is going
to do a little showing before he re-
turns." *â 
Up to a late hour the family had re
â  ceived no message from the champion,
i but the younger members of the family
! expect it. Yesterday morning before
; entering the ring Jeffries sent this mes
j sage to his folks:
"Am feeling fine. You want to pull
: for me."
Earlier in the day he had sent a mes
i sage to his brother declaring confidence
that he would win.
"He'll take good care of himself and
his money," remarked his mother; "he
always has and I think he always
will." . ' . ;;â .;,. .{--â

WANTS SMALL RING
Declares That in the San Fran-

Ran Away From Him.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, June 10.â Jeffries bears
his. lienors very modestly. It was after
2 o'clock- this morning when the new
champion reached the Vanderbilt Hotel,
but there was a great crowd awaiting
him and he received an ova,tion as he
entered the hotel.' He nodded and smiled
pleasantly to his admirers, and, after ex
changing greetings with a few intimate
friends, went to bed. He arose early this
morning and when he appeared on the
street he showed few marks of the battle..
There was a scar over his left eye, caused
by the blow from Fitzsimmon's right,. and
a small black lump stood out over the
right eye, the result of a collision with
1 /.Simmons' left hand. Otherwise he
was looking natural and perfectly happy.
After breakfast he jumped into a car
riage and rode to Brady's office, in the
Manhattan Theater building. During the
journey from the Vanderbilt Hotel to, the
theater building he was followed by a
large crowd of cheering enthusiasts. At
1 o'clock he left for Philadelphia. His
journey to the Quaker city was a tri
umphant one, cheers greeting him all
along the line.
Asked about his plans for the future
the champion said he would defend his
newly acquired title against any man in
the world, giving Sharkey the first
chance. He will take things easy for a
short time, although he would prefer to
fight Sharkey within six weeks. Brady)
however, does not want the big fellow
to figure in ring contests until after he
lias reaped the fruit of his success over
Fitzsimmons. so that it is extremely im-
probable that Sharkey and Jeffries will
fight . before six or seven months have
elapsed. ,
"When Sharkey and I do meet," said
Jeffries, "I will insist upon one condition
being incorporated in the articles of
agreement, and that will touch on the
size of the ring. I want to fight Sharkey
jin a 16-foot ring, so that he can't run
away from me like .he did when I fought
him in San Francisco. I beet Sharkey
fairly and squarely then, and if he had j
mad."' as manly a fight as Fitzsimmons I
would have knocked him out. But you
can bet the next time we face each other
he will not go the full distance." . â¢â .- i
Jeffries said that he was feeling re-
markably well. He spoke very highly of
Fitzsimmons' qualities as a fighter, and
said that the former champion had put up
a great battle.
"Fitzsimmons is a very game fellow,"
said Jeffries. "I gave him a hard punch-
ing and he took it pluckily. He stayed
: right there until he could fight no
I longer." â¢ i
Speaking of his wonderful improvement .
as a fighter, Jeffries said it was due to j
the splendid work of "Billy" Delaney and j
] "Tommy" Ryan. "Jim" said that he had
never before in his career as, a pugilist
entered the ring in such fine shape. His
! newly acquired knowledge of the scien- i
tific principles of boxing, Jeffries said,
was due to his sparring bouts with "Tom- :
; my" Ryan, the welter-weight champion.
"Ryan," said Jeffries, "taught me all ,
I of Fitzsimmons' tricks and also a few \
tricks that Fitzsimmons did not know. j
He made me not only clever with my
hands, but fast with my feet. I thor
oughly mastered Ryan's left hand feint
1 for the body, which caused Fitzsimmons
so often to draw his body in and his
head forward Into position . for a left
hand hook on the jaw. It wag just that
' kind of a blow that finally straightened
Fitzsimmons up in the eleventh round and
i gave me the opportunity to swing my
right hand with knockout force on Fitz-
simmons' jaw. My crouching position
was also the result of Ryan's tuition. My
failure to fall a victim to Fitzsimmons'
feints was due to careful practice with
Ryan. _
"In our sparring bouts Ryan showed me
"In our sparring bouts Ryan showed me
precisely how Fitzsimmons would try to
feint me into a position for a knockout
blow with either hand. When I entered
that ring I knew every move that Fitz-
simmons was going to make. My antici
pating Fltz's movements and quickness
it: evading the champion's determined ef-
forts to land on my jaw had its effect on
Fitzsimmons and contributed greatly to
my success. When Fitzsimmons tried in
the first and second rounds to locate a
vital* point and missed it greatly discon
certed him, and when I sent him to the
floor with a left-hand jolt in the second
round he was the most astonished man in
the building. I knew after that I could
beat him, and now, after beating him, I
feel that 1 can defeat any man in the
world." >: .\ :!'- "â¢â â¢,..:â¢ " "-â¢ -V.'-'
Jeffries praised Brady for the shrewd
manner in which he secured the match
for him with Fitzsimmons. -â  .- .
The new champion has offered to spar
with Fitzsimmons at a benefit if the lat
ter desires one.
FITZSIMMONS WARNED
FRIENDS NOT TO BET
CINCINNATI, June 10.â Leonard Shil-
ley, an attache of the Sheriff's office, who
is a personal friend of Bob Fitzsimmons,
some days ago received the following let-
ter from the prizefighter. It shows plain-
ly that Fitzsimmons feared defeat at the
hands of Jeffries, and had evidently
warned all his friends against placing too
much confidence in his prowess in the
battle on Friday night:
NEW YORK, May 31.
Mr. Leonard Shilley â Dear Sir:
Knowing you to have been an ardent
admirer of mine in the past and think-
ing that you probably will have confi
dence In my ability as a pugilist, I
write to you. as I have to all my close
friends, in order that their faith in me
be not- abused. You no doubt are well
aware of the fact that I am getting
along in years and have for a long
time been living a life of ease and
quiet, and, as the saying is, have not
kept up with the times.
My opponent, Mr. Jeffries, I must ad-
mit, is without a peer in our profes
sion to-day, and I would consider it
no disgrace to meet defeat at his
hands. He has youth, science, strength
and courage, and. In my opinion,
should have no trouble to defend the
title (should he gain it) from. any man
of the present time. You must under
â stand that I say this confidentially,
and would, of course., not make pub-
lie a statement of this kind, and I
further am sure that you would not
make use' of this unless it be for your
individual benefit. My object in writ-
ing this letter is:
You may be a betting man, and, like
a great many more, may have a stub-
born idea that I am invincible. If such
be the case, you might bet recklessly.
I would advise you to be careful and
not bet on general results. I will cer
tainly do my best and hope to gain the
victory. I feel safe in saying that I
will remain five or ten rounds, and. If
my usual good luck does not desert me.
I certainly will win the fight. Hoping
that you will appreciate my letter of
caution, I remain, your very sincere
friend,
ROBERT FITZSIMMONS.

mand. It may be stated as certain that
this contingency has been fully'fore
seen for months past. Fresh troops and
large quantities of munitions of war
have gone to South Africa by every
steamer. The troops have been de
scribed as reliefs', but those they were
supposed to relieve have remained in
South Africa. A steamer which sailed
in May took 500 of these reliefs, and
passengers who had previously secured
accommodations had to yield their
places to the officers and men.
In Natal, notably at Lady Smith, a
large "force has been assembled, fully
equipped and ready to march at a mo
ment's notice. Hundreds of mules from
South Africa and Cyprus are on the
spot, the storehouses are full of for

ammunition.
It is estimated that the Transvaal
could muster a fighting force of from
16,000 to 18,000 men, while the British
troops there already number 11,000 men,
commanded by the veteran, Major Gen
eral Sir William Francis Butler, who
has been in command of the troops in
South Africa since 1898. His wife Was
Elizabeth Thompson, the well-known
artist. He served in Canada In 1870,
in Ashantee in 1874; during the Zulu
war, 1878-9; in Egypt, 1882 and 1884-5,

HOUSTON, Tex., June 10.â Negroes of
this city are greatly excited over the pre
diction of a prophet named Smith that
the end of the world, is at hand. Three
hundred of his followers, dressed in their
best, assembled in an old warehouse in
Franklin street on Thursday night to
await the coming of Christ and the de
struction of the wicked. They kept up an
unearthly shouting, singing and praying
all night, and as dawn appeared and the
prophet was suddenly called to other
fields, while some showed signs of waver
ing the enthusiasm. of the others infused
them with renewed faith, and all day long
they fasted and prayed.
The excitement was nearly as great
there last night as around the place where
the prize fight bulletins were being posted,
and at midnight, when one of the female
members gave birth to a child, as pre
dicted by Smith, they became religiously
insane.
Sanitary police fumigated the building
this morning and built smoking fires out
side, but the negroes could not be driven
out.
In four other cities crowds are also
awaiting the terrible events predicted by
Smith, who is sending them- messages of
all kinds, telling his reasons of God's fail
ure to destroy the world. Families are
divided and the more intelligent colored
people are very angry with Smith. Should
he appear here again soon he will be
roughly handled.

RING BATTLE
LEFT TO CHANCE
FOR ARGUMENT
Jeffries' Victory So
Decisive.
NO ADVERSE COMMENT HEARD
BETTORS FELT THEY HAD A RUN
FOR THEIR MONEY.
Tom Sharkey Looked Upon as the
Next Man to Face Hard-Hit-
ting Jeffries in the
Ring.
Never in the history of championship
battles of the prizerint? has- there been so
little adverse comment on the outcome- of
a fight as was heard yesterday over the
meeting of Fitzsimmons and Jeffries. Af
ter reading the account of the fight the
Fitzsimmons men were satisfied that the
dethroned champion had done his best
and was forced to strike his colors to a
better man. The battle was apparently
a manly one and left no chance for a
protest from the friends of Fitzsimmons.
The majority of the bettors were sur-
prised at what was obviously the marvel-
ous improvement shown by Jeffries since
his last appearance in the ring. To Tom-
ray Ryan is accorded the most praise for
this, as he has boxed steadily with the
champion since the latter went into train-
ing some six weeks since. He has trans
mitted to the big fellow much of his own
cleverness, as Jeffries is quick to learn
new ideas in boxing. With the cleverness
added to his natural speed and strength
it is small wonder Fitzsimmons went
down before him.
"Billy" Brady, who always has a keen
eye for business, has already placed Jef-
fries on the road for exhibition purposes,
and will undoubtedly keep his name well
before the public so long as the magic of
his name proves a potent drawing card.
From present appearances Sharkey will
be the next man to face Jeffries in the
ring. McCoy, owing to the disparity be-
tween his weight and that of the cham
pion, is not looked ' upon as a possible
competitor.
Sharkey is thus the only man left with
a claim to the championship title.
Tim McGrath, who has been with
Sharkey in all his memorable ring engage-
ments, believes Sharkey can wrest the
championship from the burly Californian.
According to the McGrath point of view
Sharkey is faster on his feet than Fitz-
simmons, can hit harder and can stand
I more punishment. He is in condition all
! the time, so there is no possibility of his
I muscles losing their power or his hands
1 their cunning, as possibly happened to
! Jeffries' last opponent during his two
; years' ebsence from the ring. Sharkey be
: lieves in an active life, and has told his
friends- he would meet the winner of the
Ruhlin-Kennedy fight just to keep himself
â  in practice.
Many persons recalled yesterday Jef
i fries' first visit to this city. He was
j brought up from Los Angeles by Billy
I Gallagher, who discovered him down there
! Jeffries was a novice at the game then,
i but was willing to learn. He had the
championship bee in his bonnet at that
J time, basing his ideas chiefly upon his
; herculean frame. Sharkey was the rising
I star pugilistic at that time, and Jeffries
! promised to put on the gloves in practice,
i but for some reason he did not do so.
A big negro named Pruette was looking
for a match at the time. He was pointed
out to Jeffries, who surveyed him in awe
to see what manner of man he was. Pru-
ette was not cut out for a fighter. In
his first engagement he said his opponent
was no gentleman after he had received
'a stiff punch.
Brady, Delaney and Jeffries remembered
their friends in this city and Oakland,
sending them dispatches saying the out-
come of the battle was a foregone con-
elusion. Brady sent an urgent wire to his
' old show partner, Webster, of "After
Dark" fame. As a result, the theatrical
men were all on the right side.
In the forests of Guiana dwell some
very large and exceedingly ferocious
black ants, which throw up hills fifteen
and twenty feet in height. They will
not hesitate to attack a man, and their
headquarters are usually given a wide
berth. â¢ ". .

The Kaiser has determined that

| The Hague by America and Great \
| Britain, and it has been apparent
I ever since the conference assem- j

| delegates could hope to accom

I haps, for the conference to ad
journ at once. .
CALL HEADQUARTERS! WEL-
LINGTON HOTEL. WASHING-
TON, June 10. â Germany has
thrown off its mask and come
out the avowed opponent of the
principles of arbitration.
A cablegram setting forth this infor
mation was received to-day at the
State Department from Mr. Hollis, sec-
retary of the American delegation at
\ The Hague conference. According to
the department's information Germany
is opposed to any of the schemes of ar
bitration. which have been submitted,
and it is expected by officials that she
will use her influence to oppose its
adoption. I
This attitude may have an important
bearing on the result of the conference,
and especially upon the arbitration
plan, which has beer, a matter of spe
cial solicitude to the administration. It j
Is already apparent that the plan ap-
proved by the President proposing a |
permanent arbitration tribunal will not ;
be accepted, but it had been expected
that some of its features, at least, would
! be embodied in the plan adopted. < '-r
i many's declaration, however, places a
I different aspect upon the matter.
It is not known to what extent Ger- j
j many can influence other powers to i
j join her in her anti-arbitration atti
tude, but it was suggested to-day that
I Austria and Italy, the remaining mem
! b( is of the triple alliance, had undoubt
edly been sounded by the Berlin Gov-
eminent before it showed its hand.
It is pointed out that Italy has been
! one of the foremost nations in entering
j Into treaties with other powers for the
i arbitration of any controversies that
J might arise, and that having so com-
I mitted herself she ought to be heartily
| in favor of arbitration with as many
; nations as possible.
I It may be, however, that Germany's
I opposition is due to a secret desire to
1 prevent any satisfactory outcome to the
| conference held at Russia's initiative,
j and in which France, by reason of her
i alliance with the- St. Petersburg Gov
: ernment, is deeply interested.
In this event it is possible that Aus-
I tria and Italy have been induced to
! join Germany. Another cause for Ger
| many's hostility may be found in the
i fact that she is essentially a military
power and her policy is dictated by the
military spirit which pervades the em-
pire. Denmark will probably join with
Germany, but no guess can be made
;of the countries forming Germany's
following in this.
DELEGATES DISCUSS
BRUSSELS CONFERENCE
THE HAGUE, June 10.â The Brus
sels conference section met to-day,
Professor de Martens of .the Russian
legation presiding.
M. Bihound, one of the French dele-
I gates, submitted article '1 of, the con
ference re-drafted, which was unani
mously adopted.
Article .1 was adopted also, after dis
cussion, but article 4 was rejected.
M. Bolyn, one of Slam's delegates,
offered an amended version of article
5, which wan adopted subject to slight
future modifications.
Major General Sir John Ardath of
the British delegates declared that
Great Britain could not bind herself to
sign a convention draw from the Brus
sels conference of IST4, but. must re-
I serve the right of judging of the neces-
I sity of the expediency of abiding by
: the stipulations of that conference or
| this conference In general orders to her
armies in the event of war, or in tne
: event of opening a campaign.
Professor de Martens replied that
Russia did not ask the powers to sign
a convention on the Brussels confer
ence, but desired the powers to under-
take to embody the stipulations now
agreed upon in .the instructions given
troops at the opening of a campaign.
Major General Ardath said his
declaration was only of a personal
character, and he would consult his
Government on so important a matter.
A meeting of the principal delegates
was held to-day to request Count Mini
ster to decide the question of commu
nications with the press, but, owing to
the failure of the delegates to agree,
the meeting adjourned to Monday.
A feeling of disquietude is observable
among' the delegates of the smaller
powers at the decisions of the confer-
ence relating to the tender of good of
fices for mediation, they fearing that
this may be imposed on the lesser pow
ers in a way to restrict their indepen
dence, and several amendments to this
effect will be proposed when the scheme
is finally discused.

INSURGENTS FLEE AS
LAWTON ADVANCES
r% ra ANIL A, June 11. General
/ â¼ B. Lawton has occupied Para-
naque and the villages of Malibay,
to. the north, and Las Pinas to the
south preparatory to moving upon
Bakoor, whence- the rebels fled dur-
ing the night. The rebels deserted
Paranaque and the trenches south of
Manila at midnight,' finding the
\ Americans behind them, and escaped
along the coast. Only alleged amigos
were found in Paranaque.
MANILA, June 10, 4:30 p. m.â At day
| break to-day a force of 4500 men un-
der Generals Lawton, Wheaton and
Ovenshine advanced from San Pedro
i Macate, sweeping the country between
the Hay of Manila and Bay Lake,
south of Manila. By noon the country
| had been cleared almost to Paranque.
The Americans lost two officers killed
and twenty-one soldiers wounded.
The insurgents resisted desperately at
| th*l stronger of their positions and left
j fifty dead in the trenches. Many more
j wounded were left behind by the rebels
l in their retreat.
: The heat during the day was over-
powering and there were many pros-
trations of American soldiers from that
cause. ;;'-v:;'
General Law-ton's force consisted of
I two battalions each of the Twenty-first
| and Ninth Infantry, six companies of
i the Colorado volunteers and a detach
! ment of artillery. The Nevada cavalry
! was under General Wheaton and the
i Thirteenth and Fourteenth Infantry,
j the Fourth Cavalry and a detachment
of light artillery were under General
Ovenshine. It was scarcely dawn when
the troops, in a long silent procession,
wound up the hillside behind the
American trenches and formed a skir
mish line. Concealed in the jungle the
advance rebel outposts fired a' few
shots before being seen. The opposing
forces occupied two ranges of crescent-
shaped hills. -.
The artillery, the Colorado infantry
and the Nevada cavalry swung around
the hilltop of the left and opened the
battle at 6:30. The rebels made no re-
sponse from the hills, and the Colo
rado men cautiously advanced through
the thick grass until they were con-
fronted by a trench from which a few
weak volleys were fired. A spirited re-
sponse followed and a charge into the
trench found it to be deserted.
In the meantime a part of the Thir
teenth and Fourteenth regiments
formed in skirmish line, extending a
mile to the right, and supported by the
rest of the regiments swept down the
valley and up the hillside toward an-
other trench. Approaching through the
morass seriously hampered the Four-
teenth, and the Filipinos taking advan
-1 tage "i" this poured a galling 'ire upon
them for thirty minutes. . The Four-
teenth was twice comnelled to with-
draw for the purpose of finding a sat'-
crossing in the swamp. â¢ Finally the
trench was enfiladed on both flanks.
The rebels fled to the woods and sus
tained severe loss.
General Lawton then pushed his en-
tire command south through the titer
of the isthmus until a few miles south
of Paranaque, when he swung around
and halted on account of the he it.
During the march men were pros-
trated on all sides, owing to lack of
water and exposure to the sun. It is
estimated that 40 per cent of the troops
were exhausted.
The double turreted monitor Monad-
nock and three other vessels shelled
Paranaque this morning and the rebels
promptly evacuated the place.
AUTHORITIES PLEASED
BY OTIS' ACTIVITY
WASHINGTON, June 10.â Assurances
have been received by the President from
President Schurman that the report of
friction in the Philippines Commission is
untrue arrd that the members are harmo
niously co-operating. As a matter of fact
it Is believed that future harmonious co
operation is assured by Instructions given
to General Otis and President Schurman
that there shall be no further negotia
tions with the Insurgents until they come
to make, distinct propositions for peace.
Appreciating that there is little pros
pect of submission on the part of the Fil
ipinos until they are thoroughly disorgan
ized. General Otis has informed the war
Department of a plan of campaign which
he proposes to pursue, the execution of
which began to-day with the expedition
commanded by General Lawton to the
south of Manila. The authorities pre
serve the greatest secrecy concerning the
plan of campaign because of the danger
that It will be cabled to Hongkong and
transmitted to Aeuihaldo, but it is known
that General Otis desires to destroy the
Insurgent army in the province of Cavlte,
which is the hotbed of the insurrection.
The authorities are pleased with Gen
eral Otis' activity, as they say his inten
tion to continue operations during the
rainy season will prevent the reorganisa
tion of the ins-urgent army and will deter
other Filipinos from joining Agu/naldo's
forces, besides unfitting them for tho
energetic campaign which will be institut
ed at the commencement of the dry sea
son. ': -'

CAPTAIN NICHOLS
DIES At MANILA
WASHINGTON, June 10. â A cablegram was received r.i the Navy De
partment to-day from Captain Barker, the naval officer in com
mand at Manila, announcing the sudden death of Captain Henry
Nichols from sunstroke. Captain Nichols was the commander of
the monitor Monadnock.
Captain Nichols was born in New York and went to the Naval Academy
in 1861. His first service was on the Swatara in the West Indies and in the
European squadron. He became an ensign in 1866, master in 1868 and lieu
tenant in 1869, when he was attached to the port admiral's ship Frolic in
New York harbor. Other service which followed was on ordnance duty in
Pittsburg; on torpedo duty in the coast survey in 1875 and 1577; in the
European station in IS7S; again on the coast survey commanding the Hass
ler in 1884, and on the board of inspection in 1891, when he became a com
mander. He took command of the Bennington in 1597 and crossed with her
from Honolulu to join Dewey before Manila last July. He was attached to
the Mare Island navy-yard for a short time last fall, and took command of
the Monadnock January 18, 1899. He was promoted to captain March 30
last While in command of the Monadnock Captain Nichols saw more ac
tive service than most of the other vessels of Dewey's squadron, his being
relied on to assist the army in nearly all of the movements northward from
Manila against the insurgents. : .",- . â¢

MOON BLADES, SMOKE
RISES, PARROT CRIES
Incidents ThaL Cause a Panic During
. a Performance of "Romeo
and Juliet."
CHICAGO, June 10.â Contingencies for
which William Shakespeare made no al
lowance arose during Maude Adams' per
formance .of "Romeo and Juliet" at Pow
ers Theater this afternoon. The moon,
which is supposed to shed its soft radi
'""'" over the garden of the Capuleta
while Romeo makes love to Juliet on the
balcony above, became aggressive and
caught fire. It made much smoke, which
floated out over the audience and created
some uneasiness. Finally a nervous
woman in the balcony started for the door
at a lively gait, and in a moment the
aisles were full of women following her
example, the majority of them leaving
bats and wraps behind them.
The orchestra struck up "The Star
âºSpangled Banner," Romeo dropped the
acting business anfl, coming down to the
footlights, shouted: "Ladies, sit down
ladjes-, sit -down." But the ladies would
not srt down until Manager Powers of the
theater climbed on the stage and assured
the audience that a bit of insulation on
the moon wire had .become ignited but a
good portion of the moon had been saved.
The fire was out and there was no danger.
Quiet was restored and Romeo was
again telling Juliet his opinion of her,
while a parrot next door to the theater
sent a few/blood-curdling shrieks through
the windows, which had been opened to
allow the passage of smoke.
The audience was nervous and for a
minute there was a prospect of trouble
but they were quieted down once more;
the parrot subsided and Romeo started iii
for the third round, which he finished
without interruption.
During the trouble Miss' Adams re
mained on the balcony smiling, waiting
for the moon and parrot to subside and ;
for Romeo; to come back. It was a try
ing ordeal; for Miss Adams and Mr. Fa
versham. who played Romeo, and but for
their coolness and .that of Mr. Powers, a I
disastrous panic might have resulted. '

STOCKTON, June 10.â Walter D.
Henderson and Miss Mabel Kafitz were
the only members of the party on the
,11-fal d catamaran Wave who lost their
lives. The swift surrents of the San
Joaquin have not given up the dead,
although anxious friends have searched
the banks for miles. How the other
twenty-one members of the party,
mostly young ladies, too, ever sur
mounted the terrible odds against them
and reached land passes comprehen
sion. It seems that the Wave was just
preparing to make a landing at the
chicory factory, when the boat lurched
and filled rapidly, instantly all was
confusion, some tumping and others be
ing pushed overboard, and within a few
seconds the young men and women
were struggling madly for life. Gertie
Lang swam out, refusing assistance.
The boys quickly began the work of
saving the girls, some of whom still
clung to the overturned catamaran,
screaming wildly.
Harry White and Ralph Yardley ac
quitted themselves creditably and
brought four girls ashore. Maud Mar
tit; swam fully a mile in search <â !' two
Bisters who she feared had drowned.
Alva Atw. "d and Lloyd Woods re
mained so long in the water that they
came near going down and had to be
assisted. A small boat finally came
from the other side of the river and
assisted in the work of rescue
When the young people were got to
gether it was at first thought all had
been saved, but Miss Kafitz and Hen
derson were found to he absent. The
hunt was fruitlessly resumed.
The launch Viola, which left here at
3 a. m. with a party of friends aboard,
intercepted the careened Wave. Two
of the party mounted the bottom and
tore off boards, thinking some one
might be imprisoned. Several hats and
ladies wraps were found, but that was
all. Henderson's coat was there.
The stories of the disaster afterward
told to th* Viola passengers were so
conflicting that it is little wonder exag

LAUNCHING OF
THE COLUMBIA
Cup Defender Slides In-
to the Water.
â¦ â
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BRISTOL, B. 1.. June America's
new cup defender, the representative
of the best boat-building skill and ma
terial of which the Western Continent
can boast, was carefully lowered Into
the water at the Herreshoff works at
8:30 o'clock to-night, and as she start
ed down the ways Mrs. Oliver C. Iselin
christened her "Columbia."
The launching of the latest protector!
of Uncle Sam's sailing laurels was â 
probably one of the most spectacular -
that has ever occurred, for the light
of day had almost faded when she
started down the ways and three pow- j
erful calcium lights played upon her |
white stern and shining golden under
body with theatrical effect. As she
fairly cleared the shed a large silk;
American yacht ensign was broken
out over her stern, the colors of her
owners appeared on a small jury mast,
stepped in place of the regular mast,
and the New York Yacht Club pennant ;
flew In the waist of the boat. With
the lights playing on the flags and â 
twenty or more of the crew lying about i
the deck, th.- scene was filled with ani
mation and color.
Ranged on both sides of the dock
were 5000 spectators, while off the end
were clustered fifty or more yachts of
all kinds, so that there was plenty of
noise, cheers, whistles and guns to

MISS MABEL KfI FITZ.
There were rumors to-day that Pilot
Peterson knew the beat was leaking
during the down trip. This is denied,
but an Investigation shows that the
catamaran was not trustworthy. The
rescued people all remember having
met some one during the vivid experi
ence in the water, but no one remem
bers having seen or heard Miss Kafltz
or Henderson.
Many heroic deeds are reported. Wal
ter Rose, one of the party who went
to the res. tie in a boat, says:
"Such a cool lot of young people I
never saw before. One of the Misses
Martin kept calling to the girls to keep
help out the brilliant effect of the
lights.
Mrs. Iselin did her part gracefully,
surrounded by a half hundred society
leaders of New York, Providence and
Boston and' many yachting friends of
her husband. The launching was a
great success from beginning to .end,
being attended only by an unfortunate
accident among th.- spectators. A new
cup defender is again ail. .at and in a
few weeks will be ready to battle for
the yachting supremacy of the world.
While twice before in its history this
little town has felt the thrill accom
panying the launching of an American
cup defender, the lowering into the
water to-night of the beautiful sloop
Columbia was. nevertheless, an event
of great importance to Bristol as well
as to the entire yachting world. Sim
ultaneously with the arrival of numer
out yachtsmen from New York and
Boston in the morning, there sailed into
the harbor and anchored off the
Browns sheds at the Herreshoffs a
score or more steamships, schooners
and sloops, and from the decks of these
yachts people watched all the afternoon
the final preparations for the evening's
event.
An hour before the launching the big
d<*>r that for weeks had screened the
back end of the shed was taken down.
and for the first time the world had a
chance to see the shining underbody of
the. boat. Inside the shed, assembled
under the how of the boat, was the
christening party, with Mrs. Iselin as
the central figure, while on deck were
twenty of the Columbia's crew with one
or two officers and Nat Herreshoff.
At 8:05 Mr. Herreshoff gave the sig
nal, and the work of lowering the boat
into the water began. It took about ten
minutes to get her started, and at 8:14
she was seen to move. There was con
siderable creaking at first, arid one or
two short stops, but at 8:19 she began
to slide -steadily, and then it was that
Mrs. Iselin dashed the bottle of cham
pagne against her bow and said:
"I christen thee Columbia."
As the boat came slowly out there
was a shout from the crowd. Slowly
the boat- moved down the railway and
the place resounded with cheers and
handclapping. When half the stern
overhanging was clear of the shed a
half dozen of the new boat's crew who
were lying on her deck jumped to their
feet and raised a magnificent Ameri
can Yacht Club ensign in the air.
Then there was another bustling on
the dock and a half dozen men raised
the white star and crescent on a red
burgee above a red and black burgee
below, the ! colors of Commodore J.
Pierpont Morgan and Colonel Oliver
Iselin. respectively. Soon that long, ta
pering how was clear of the shed, and
on the extreme end a staff hearing the
New York Yacht Club's burgee was
slipped into a socket. Inch by inch the
long, slim craft moved down and the
water soon lapped the metal rudder,
which gleamed like "--old under the rays
of the lights, and the water crept up
until the rudder head was completely
submerged and the keel was hidden
from view. j_ i
Just as the Columbia was about out
a distressing accident occurred. The
explosion of a can of flashlight powder
blew a leg and part of the head off Na
poleon; San Souci. aged 12 years, .broke
the legs of two other boys and severely
Injured several other persons. < The
photographer who caused the accident
selected the top of a shed, the roof of
which was closely packed with boys.
In pouring out the flashlight powder a
train must have been left, connecting
the large can of explosive with the small
quantity on the camera. As the pho
tographer touched the fuse he shouted
a warning, but there was no space in
which the boys could move. A terrific
explosion followed, the entire shed col
lapsing. Many, women on the wharves
fainted from the shock and there was
great excitement.
Policemen pulled the injured from the
wreck and carried them into the Herre
shoff shops. San Souci was taken from

Clarence Hall swam around until he'

by, where he died in a few minutes
without regaining consciousness. The
Injured are all Bristol boys and the oc
: currence has cast a gloom over the Co
i lumbia's launching.
To the casual observer the Columbia
resembles the Defender in many re-
spects. There is th.- same long over
: hang both forward and aft and the
'.mi.- deep underbody, with tons of lead
east into a bulb-shaped keel- at the
very bottom. A careful study of the'
] hull reveals many points in which the
new- craft differs from the champion
of '96. The Columbia has a long,
tapering bow, rounding up gradually
; from the keel and ending in an ex-
tremely sharp point at the stem. The
stern overhang is longer and flatter
j than was the Defender's, and. in fact,
the entire hull has the appearance of
having a much flatter floor than did the
older boat. Then the underbody is con-
I siderably shorter at the foot than was
| that of the Defender and the lead is
; said to be cast so ' that it gradually
' rounds out from a four-inch thickness
to three feet through at its widest part.
Neither Herreshoff nor Mr. Iselin
I would give out a single figure or make
a comparison between the new boat
| and the Defender to-day.
A resident of Bristol, who has been
watching the Columbia clay after day,
says when the tape was run along
from stem to stern she measured 132
feet 8 inches. Her beam is reported to
; be 24 feet 2M> inches and from the top
of her 10-inch crown deck to the base
of the lead keel the new boat measures
] close to 25 feet, just about what the
Defender measured. The keel is esti
: mated to be 29 feet long at the very
| foot and contains about ninety-five
tons of lead. Allowing for a free board
! of about three feet nine inches, the Co
| lumbia will be very close to 90 feet on
the water line when her spars, sails,
rigging and racing equipment is aboard.
Her draft will be 20 feet 3 inches.
William Young, an old friend Of John
B. Herreshoff, whose home is in Balti-
more, was stricken with apoplexy while
looking at the Columbia in the shed

INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., June 10.â
j Sentinel to-morrow will say: The trust i
! mania. has reached the brewers, and it is \
I said on the best authority that a scheme
is on foot to form a trust with $1,000,009,
- capital and buy up all the breweries in
the country. It is said that the scheme
i received impetus at the national conven
â  tion of brewers at Detroit, when plans
I were discussed secretly.
While the trust is only in the formative
stage, enough men of capital are behind
It, judging trom reports, to warrant the
belief that the American beer drinker will |
: soon have no other alternative than to
I quench his thirst on the product of a
j trust.
Joseph C. Schaf. president of the Ameri- !
can Brewing Company of this city. Who
returned to-day from Detroit, where he
j attended the rtational meeting of brewers,
admitted to-day that the subject of a
; brewer trust was a topic of private con-
sideration at the convention, at which WW
: leading brewers were present. He said j
i that he did not care to talk much about j
â  it. as the matter is in its infancy mow.
He had calculated, he said, that some-
thing more than a billion dollars would j
be required, as there are 2200 breweries in.
the country to be bought up. It is un-
derstood that an option has been placed
by the trust on Mr. Schaf's brewery, and
this he did not deny. He did not care to
talk about that phase of it. he said. When '
asked hqw many options had been secured
. in Indiana to date he said: "At a guess
I should say eight or ten to date."
Mr. Schaf declined to say who are be- I
hind the brewery trust, but replied in re-
sponse to that question, "Eastern capital-
ists are promoting the trust."
Albert Lieber, manager of the brewery |
syndicate of this city, which includes the j
| three largest breweries here, to-night con
! firmed the story of the formation of the
i gigantic brewery trust. Mr. Lieber had
just returned from Detroit, and after
learning that the story was out said:
"A Pittsburg broker named Merkle, rep-
resenting the American Malting Company
has just closed a deal involving $!'2.090,ti00,
whereby all the Pennsylvania breweries
were consolidated. This was one of the
first steps in the big scheme. Options are
now out on a number of Indiana brewer-
ies, and the same is true of other States.
The principal factor in the big scheme is j
Seymour Scott, a wealthy broker of New
York City, who has been working on it |
for some time.
"The scheme is a stupendous one, and it
will require at least three years to per-
feet. The American Malting, Company
already has a monopoly on all the malt
produced in this country. The distilleries
will all be bought up. and also all of the '
I 200 breweries. I should say it will at least '
j require $1,000,000,000 to do the work. The
consumer will not lose. Beer will remain
, at 5 cents a glass, but taxes and other
expenses will be decreased and better beer
j will be placed on the market. At the ex-
piration of three years 1 look to see all !
, the malt dealers, distilleries and brewers
of the United States controlled by one
1 working head."
Mr. Lieber did not deny that there is i
|. an option out on the three big breweries
in this city controlled by his syndicate.

COMMUNICATIONS TO SE SCIEN
COMMUNICATIONS TO BE SCIEN-
TIFICALLY ESTABLISHED.
The Professor of Columbia University
Promises to Clearly Show Evi
dence of the Immortality
dence of the Immortality
of the Soul.
. Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, June 10.â Dr. James H.
Hyslop, professor of psychology, ethics
and logic in Columbia University, has
come back to New York from Boston and
reasserted this evening* the statement he
made a few days ago in Boston that he is
sure he can scientifically prove life after
death. He bases his opinion on what he
says is the incontrovertible fact that he
has actually talked, through a human me
dium, with persons long since dead. This
medium is the famous Mrs. Piper of Bos
ton, with whom he has had in all seven
teen sittings. â¢ Four of these have taken
place in the past few days.
"I am absolutely certain," Professor
Hyslop said to-day, "that within a year
1 shall be able to lay before theworld con
clusive evidence of the immortality of the
soul. In my seventh en sittings with Mrs.
Piper not once has she told me facts con
nected only with my own memory. Each
time they have been common to myself
and to persons long since dead. And this
is also true of a great number of scientific
men who have examined her. I have re
ceived in my sittings and I have identified
twenty-five names belonging to persons
not necessarily my relatives or even ac
quaintances."
Dr. Hyslop's next step will be to organ
ize a body of scientific men to Investigate
the facts. He will also expose the frauds.
As to the effects of the theory being
proved true. Professor Hyslop said:
"It will almost completely revolutionize
the ideals of religion, morality and poli
tics. It will disturb the dogmatic theol
ogy, but it will rejuvenate the churches'
moral influence by inspiring confidence in
immortality of the soul. In morals the
economic ideal of getting simply enough
to live with will be changed to a spiritual
ideal, a sincere regard for the hereafter.
I can show, however, and shall do so. that
the medieval idea of eternal punishment
hereafter will be broken down. This fact,
politically, will strengthen- the necessity
for strong government and also the grow
ing tendency of respect for the individ
ual."

are much improved by "abundant rain.
According to the Mark Lane Express,
the following are the conditions of crops
in different countries: In France the
crop of 1599 does not appear to leave much
to be desired. The weather has become
most favorable. The area sown for win
ter crops .is about the. same as last year,
while there is a slight diminution in the
acreage of "spring crops. ' The harvest of
winter crops promises exceedingly well,
although in appearance slightly inferior
to last year's, but spring crops do not
appear to promise well. -
In Austria-Hungary the official estimate
of the wheat crop of 1899 is rather more
than 17.000,000 quarters, compared with
16 000,000 'quarters in IS9S and 11,250,000 in
1897 Recently too much rain is reported
in some sections, but there is no fear of
much damage. Rye and oats promise a

TO GUARD AGAINST
ENTRY OF SMALLPOX
Precautionary Measures to Be Adopt-
ed When Troops Return
From Manila.
LOS ANGELES, June 10.â The State I
Board of Health will at its next meeting, !
|in . July, arrange rules and regulations 'â 
: and make note of contagious diseases I
j that, are expected to be brought Into the I
â¢ port of San Francisco by soldiers soon I
to return from Manila. Dr. Randolph D.
Hill of this city, a member of the State
'â  board, to-day said that everything that
j the State authorities can do would be
I done against the introduction -of contag-
ion. Upward of 5000 troops from the Phil
ippines are expected to be landed on th?
coast during the next three months, and
the question of guarding against the in-
I troduction of smallpox and other diseases-
is causing the State Health Board much
concern.
"The United States quarantine officials
are not always as vigilant as they should
be, said Dr. Hill, "as a leper was a short
time ago landed from Honolulu.' He was
not apprehended and is still at large no
one knows where. Dr. Ruggles of the
State Board of ' Health recognized the
case, but was too late. The afflicted one
had disappeared. Complaint was made
to Washington, but nothing further has
been heard of the matter."
Objecting to Ballots.
CARSON, New, June 10.â The Governor

objected to and Sadler laid out about as
many. Elko precinct brought out a bunch
ot objections. McMillan objected to fif
teen, while Sadler threw out sixteen. Out
of twenty-five votes in Halleck McMillan
objected to eight, th-Â» word "Constable"
being marked on them. One marked

FINANCIAL CRASH

Danger That Confronts

"The situation I regard as dangerous
II t is certainly not a healthy state of af-
fairs when you see people mortgaging all
they possess, even the very furniture in
their houses, to pay the first assessment
on new schemes, without knowing where
or how they are going to raise the money
for the next assessments.
Most of these people buy shares only
for speculation. They tell me, as a
banker, some .if them, that they do not

hard to imagine what sort of a situation
will develop when succeeding payments
approach. " ' '';
"Tin new enterprises are, no doubt,
allâ or nearly all- good for the country,
but this feverish state of unrest and ex-
citement in th<t community I do not con-
sider healthy.
Man of the sugar plantations here
will, 1 believe, always hold their own
with any In the world and be good In-

paying too much for a $20 gold piece.
When enterprises of this kind assume the
form of a boom instead of an Intelligent

dangerous for the community, especially
e.i for people of small means.
"Capital for all the new enterprises on

German Merchants Will

BERLIN, June 10.â Fresh reports say
the Chamber of Commerce of Gladbach
has unanimously rejected the invitation
of the Philadelphia Museum of Commerce
to co-operate with it. The influential
Rhenish and Westphalian Zeitung calls
the invitation a "native attempt to induce
the German Michael to come and be
skinned," and a number of other papers
Indorse this statement, claiming the
Americans are already doing enough
espionage upon German industry.
The Agrarian newspapers continue, to
cite the alleged discovery and seizure of
trichinous American meats. Such cases
the reported this week from Hof, Bavaria;
Brunswick, Hildesheim, Alona and Bo-
chum. Professor Stiles, the scientific at-
tache of the United States Embassy, is
investigating the cases, of course they
are generally used to prejudice consumers
against American meats. Two large lots
or damaged hams, weighing altogether
5000 pounds, were seised in Berlin, and the
dealer claimed he had received them from
an Altona importer named Mohr, who is
said to have received them direct from
the United States.
Ernest Bennlnghoven, writing from Chi
cago to the Agrarian Deutsche Tage Zei-
tung, makes long revelations as to iho
"disgusting and dishonest" practices of
the packers. These remain uncontradicted
and are being widely reprinted.

while with young Prince Lynar, whoso
mother is an American, and inquired
pleasantly after his American relatives.
The Prince's mother was a Miss Parsons
of Columbus, Ohio. The Prince is a lieu-
tenant of the Guards dv Corps Regiment.
The Emperor will visit Bonn during the

FRUIT GROWERS
FIGHT MONOPOLY
The Co-operative Move
Gains Adherents.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LODI, June 10.â The fruit growers of
this end of San Joaquin County have de
cided to fight the old fruit transportation
and selling companies and sell for them
selves. A rousing convention was held
here this afternoon, nearly every fruit
grower in the neighborhood being present
to |isten to arguments in favor of the In
d( U'ndont transportation line and to what
might be said against the proposition as
V./-11. It was believed that persons in sym
pathy with the Earl and Porter companies
would make a strong stand against the
proposed new.line, but nothing of the kind
occurred.
The meeting was called to order by W.
E. Lovdal of the State executive commit
tee. J. D. Huffman was elected perma
nent chairman and F. B. Mills secretary.
R. D. Stephens, chairman of the State
executive committee, made a strong
speech for organization. He showed the
power of the fruit grower in an entirely
new phase, proving that the grower made
it possible for the Earl-Porter trust to ex
ist or to go out of business unless new
rates were established and honest returns
made. He spoke of the actual cost of
cars, Ice, etc., from actual experience,
saving he had been forced to handle his
own trull or dig up his orchards. He told
of the unhappy experience of growers in
other places who were under the control
of the combine, as the local growers would
surely be unless they organized far mutual
protection. He made a very plain and
convincing speech.
Rattling speeches were delivered by Mr.
Lovdal and State Treasurer Galvin. They
were to the effect that while other com
panies were ready to promise lower rates
and fairer treatment It was all done to
keep out opposition and control the en
tire fruit output of the State closer than
ever.
Subscriptions to the capital stock of
1000,000 were called for and In a few min
utes thirty-one shares had been signed
for, amounting to $1600. Other growers
agreed to sign for stock in a few days
and the utmost enthusiasm prevailed.
Nearly every fruit man appeared to think
the move for an Independent refrigerator
line a grand Idea, though some doubt that
anything could be done this year. It is
admitted that a strong organization will
be formed here, hoping in time to em
brace all of the growers. A majority
of the growers here are not bound ' to
the outside combines and are free to
combine for themselves on an independ
ent system.
H. L. Gibbs of the Gibbs-Irons Com
pany said after the meeting that the
Santa Fe line would give the local grow
ers good Inducements to use its cars, in
timating that a cut in rates would be
made if that line obtained the business.
The Santa Fe people offered cars by July
1, he said, and the growers ' could use

NEWCASTLE, June 10.â Local fruit
growers met in Fraternal Hall this
afternoon. After the election of tem
porary officers the reports of the com
mittees appointed at the last meeting
were called for. They contained the
recommendation that .crop marketing
contracts, articles of incornoration and
by-laws be presented to the convention
of growers to be held in Sacramento
on June 17 for its consideration, they
to be indorsed by the growers of Pla
cer County interested in the movement.
During the discussion which followed
the report the suggestion was made
that a refrigerator car line was not the
only salvation of the growers, but that
| in order to reap the full benefits they
i must establish Eastern agencies for
marketing and shipping purposes. G.
I L. Threlkeld said he was in favor of
; empowering the State trustees to es
| tablish these Eastern agencies, and he
| believed it should be the duty of the
Trustees to attend to this matter. W.
R. Fountain, a member of the State
1 central committee, was questioned as
! to what his views were concerning Mr.
Stephens' ideas on this question, and
'â  he expressed the opinion that Mr. Ste
: phens favored shipping and marketing.
Delegates were selected for the com
: ing convention. No decisive steps were
I taken owing to the desire of growers
j to await the results of the State meet

DOES NOT PLEASE
ALL THE GERMANS
Comment on Purchase
of Carolines.
Copyrighted, 1599, by the Associated Press.
BERLIN, June 10.â The cession of the
South Sea Islands to Germany focussed
attention during the week. A curious fea
ture was that while on reclept of the news
the press as well as everybody else at
first expressed satisfaction, this changed
radically as the week advanced and the
terms of the bargain became known. Not
only did the radical and socialist press
severely criticize the terms as" exorbitant
and far beyond tho value of the islands,
but a large portion of the press reflecting
the views of other parties did the same.
Prince Bismarck's saying in 1885, charac
terizing the Carolines as lumperei, is
quoted. According to the latest official
statistics German trade in the islands for
several years has not exceeded two nun
dred marks yearly, and no German ex
ports have been sold there for some time.
After listening to the statements of the
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Baron yon
Buelow, In the Reichstag, the criticism
became severe. The Frankfort Zeitung
says:
â¢'The text of the agreement shows that
Spain retains all the advantages of own
ership, retains full liberty for the clerical
orders, has a coaling station in each
group of the islands and is put commer
cially on the same footing as Germany,
while she merely cedes to Germany the
onus of the cost of the administration and
receives an exorbitant price, which prob
ably no other power would have paid."
Recalling Prince Bismarck's opinion, the
paper adds: "Now this lumperei is all at
once believed to be worth $17,000,000."
The National Liberal Correspondenz,
usually an enthusiastic supporter of mat
ters calculated to increase Germany's
colonial possessions, disparages the new
acquisitions, pointing out that the only
advantage Is a new tariff understanding
with Spain. - - ..'". â - â â *
. A Foreign Office official who was em
powered to speak for the Minister of For
eign Affairs, Baron yon Buelow, said to
the correspondent here -of the Associated
Press .that- he fully expects to see the
Reichstag pass the appropriation for the
purchase money by a large majority, add
ing that the Freislnniges and Socialists
will be the only parties to vote agajinst it,
though the Center might make its approv
al conditional. , â  v -..,-'
The bin for the appropriation will pro
vide for the administration of the new
possessions/and it is said the tariff un
derstanding with Spain is only of a gen
eral nature, Germany and Spain admitting
each other among the favored nation
clauses. â _

JEALOUS RAGE
BALKS JUSTICE
Suspect Dier Supplied
With Wine.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, June 10.â The laurels
which Sheriff Taylor and Detective Gib
ton deemed themselves in a fair way to
earn by obtaining a confession of guilt
from James Dier, the suspected murderer
of old "Pete" Lorraine, have been
whisked almost out of sight, thanks to
the misdirected efforts of aÂ»San Francisco
daily. The officials claim that, baffled in
the scheme to make of the Marin author
ities tools to be used in preparing saffron
fakes on a Mafia Society that never ex
isted and a female Sherlock Holmes that
sprang armed and booted from a per
fervld imagination, an Examiner "special
commissioner" and a local assistant
planned a little surprise, the ultimate re
sults of which may be to defeat' the end 3
of justice.
For two days Dier has been exceedingly
nervous and almost on the point of col
lapse. Several times he has become so
desperate that Taylor and Gibson have
managed to obtain conflicting statements
as regards his actions and whereabouts.
Yesterday evening Dier said a companion
was with him on the Monday night when
the aged woodchopper disappeared and
that this companion departed for Mendo
cino County the next morning. He re
fused to give the man's name, and when
his assertions were proved false he ran
Into an adjoining cell and flung himself
upon a cot. The two officials left him
alone, satisfied that in a few hours they
would be able to learn everything they
expected.
Three hours later they visited Dier
again, and were astounded to And him
under the influence of liquor. He refused
to make any statement and threatened
to thrash both Taylor and Gibson. A
search disclosed the fact that he had been
supplied with a bottle of wine. Dier first
said the wine had been given to him by an
Examiner reporter, but afterward admit
ted that the reporter had sent It to him
by Deputy Sheriff Lucas.
An investigation showed that Lucas,
who is regarded as an exemplary officer,
had been going the rounds or the saloons
during the evening with the Examiner
men and had afterward went to Dior's
cell and given him the wine. Lucas ad
mitted his indiscretion and was severely
reproved "by the Sheriff. Gibson said it
was the most peculiar thing he had ever
known to be done In a case where a man
was charged with so grave an offense.
Dier was not only given the wine to brace
him up but was told not to confess -that
not a scrap of evidence had been obtained
against him, and he would soon be re
leased on a writ of habeas corpus.
Detective Miles A. Bolger of Curtln's
Agency went to Carson Canyon this morn
ing and will remain there to-night seeking
evidence. He believes with Taylor and
Gibson that Dier is the guilty .man. Thy*
latter two officials will make an extended
search for Lorraine's body to-morrow and
are confident the mystery will be cleared
in a short time.

RIG STRIKE OF
STREETCAR MEN
Cleveland Trolley Lines
Are Tied Up.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, June 10.â What
promises to be a long and bitter contest
between the Cleveland Electric Railway
(Big Consolidated) and its 900 employes
was inaugurated at 4 o'clock this morn
| ing by a strike which tied up all of the
fourteen lines operated by the company.
I These lines reach all sections of the city,
1 and they form the only means of trans
] portation for more than 100,000 people liv-
I ing in a territory live miles long and three
: miles wide at the South End.
The west side is affected but little,
only one line passing through that sec-
tion, while on the east side four lines of
the Little Consolidated, of which Senator
Hanna is president, are available for use
by most of the patrons of the tied up
lines in that section. Thus far the Little
Consolidated men have refused to strike
and they are not likely to go out.
The strike is mainly for the recognition
j of the union, and the men have been pre
! paring for it for several weeks. Presi
dent Henry A. Everett says he is willing
to concede all the other demands of the
men and will adjust all other grievances
presented by his employes, but declares
that he will never recognize the union.
whose demands he. characterizes as ; ty
rannical.
It Is well understood that the company
has employed men in other cities to taka
the places of the strikers, but It is diffi
cult to ascertain whether many of these
men are now in the city. â¢ Only about half
a dozen cars were operated to-day. Those
I were on the Euclid avenue line, and they
were under the guard of deputy sheriffs
; and were operated by imported men. A
! few mail cars were run by the strikers,
! who say they will not obstruct the mail.
There have been several riotous demon-
strations to-day. but none of a really seri
ous nature. There is not likely to be any
I serious trouble until Monday, because
j there will be no further attempt to operate
I the lines until to-night. The only cars
to be moved to-morrow will be those car
-1 rying the United States mail, and the
i strikers have volunteered to see that those
i are operated so long as no passengers aro
I carried. __^_

LET THE SUPERVISORS MEET.
OX January 3, 1899, by a unanimous vote, the
Board of Supervisors passed a resolution
designating each Monday at 2 p. m. as the
time for its weekly meeting. But for this resolution,
as on Monday. May 29, 1899, the board adjourned
without day. The Call would have no doubt of the
solidity of Mr. Phelan's opinion that, unless invited
by himself, there could be no further meeting until
the first Monday in July. But. in view of the uncer
tainty produced by this unanimous action, we con
sider that prudence requires the presence of the
minority at the meeting that will unquestionably be
held by the majority to-morrow. If that meeting is
not called b}- the Mayor and should turn out to be
illegal the presence or the absence of the minority
v. ill not affect the result. If, on the contrary, it
should be held valid, then the presence of the mi
nority, with one member of the majority who may
be relied upon to vote with them against all of the
railroad's proposals that are not indorsed by the
community, may avert great public disaster.
There are many items of routine business, [
involving payments to honest citizens and mat- j
ters of current importance. that ought not
to be delayed unless the acceptance of a supreme
risk is essential to the public welfare. But, in the
opinion of The Call, there is no such crisis, and, as
has been already suggested, the legality of to-mor
row's proceedings cannot be influenced by the num
ber of Supervisors in excess of six who may be pres
ent. We do not share the suspicions of Supervisor
Kaiben expressed in yesterday's issue of one of our
contemporaries. We believe he may be fully relied
upon to adhere to the position he has voluntarily and
openly assumed.
Neither The Call nor the public has objected to the
extension of pro, street railway facilities to the
northeastern part of San Francisco, within the limita
tions indorsed by the Merchants' Association. That
does not require the resurrection of dead franchises
by the extension of electrical privileges 01 Geary
street, between Taylor street and Grant avenue. We
understand, indeed, that the Market Street Railway
x^owrr-'"" has determined not to press that and va
rious other parts of the wholesale scheme of confis
cation that has been so opportunely checked. No
franchise or privilege of any kind should be even
considered in-fore the new charter takes effect, ex
cept what is strictly essential to meet the wants of
the district to which we have alluded Beyond the
use of electricity on the Post street line, possibly the
new franchise asked for a single block on Taylor
street, between Geary and Post streets, and, further,
the application of electricity to franchises already held
en Montgomery and Sansome streets, there does not
appear to be the. slightest need of any further action
by the board at the present time. Under no cir
cumstances â at any rate until the new charter
is operative â should any extensive franchise be
granted, and especially the franchise demanded on
Grant avenue, between Geary and Bush streets, and
down Bush street to Sansome street. The entire con
nection needed to bring the northeastern section of
the city and the Potrero together, as we are informed,
can be made by the Post street liqe and its Mont
gomery street adjunct.
We again suggest that the minority of the board
meet the issue boldly, and leave no loophole, by their
absence to-morrow, for cavil or criticism. The
monopolistic street railway grab apparently is al
ready beaten, and. in our opinion, can never be re
vived.
Aguinaldo promises to keep General Otis busy I
during the rainy season. The Filipino leader does!
not seem to have sense enough to keep out of the
wet.

Philip Kolb of Pieasanton believes he was flim

One thing is certain â Jeffries, now that he is

in a boiler-shop. .
Governor Gage must find congenial company in the
Yosemite. The great valley has long been noted for
its big blubs.
BELMONT AS A STRIKER.
PERRY BELMONT, the gold Democrat, must
stir his energies to action or hire an advertis-
ing, agent if he desire to hold any longer the
Belmont headship in New York politics. The other
Belmont. O. H. P., is forcing his way to the front
j with ceaseless activity and shouting Democratic war
I cries with a voice whose uproar sounds like the bel
j lowing of the bull of Bashan.
Ever since he deserted the gold banquet of Tam
| many to dine at the dollar dinner with Bryan, O. H.
\ }'. Belmont has been assuming more and more the
i manner and the method of a leader who aspires to
play the part of a political Moses and lead his fol-
lowers out of the Egyptian darkness in which they
' are dwelling. Being unable to stump the country like
Bryan, or to utter with his tongue words enough to
promulgate his principles or satisfy his desires, he
has established in New York a journal called the Ver
dict to assist him in his aspirations.
The avowed object of O. H. P. and his paper is to
harmonize the warring factions -of Democracy. To
: that end he proposes a general acceptance of the
Chicago platform and an agreement to store it away
with the party treasures of the past. He urges his
followers to an aggressive fight for nearly everything
demagogues can dream of except free silver. In a
recent issue of Verdict the appeal went forth:
"Draw your politics as you might a sword and
throw away the scabbard. Strike for an income tax!
Strike for an inheritance taxi Strike for a levy, on
churches! Strike for the public ownership of .fran
chises! Strike for the death of the trust! Strike for
the destruction of the national bank! Strike for a
live-and-let-live system of honest currency and bank-
ing in its stead. Strike for the , overthrow of Presi
dential patronage the bribe of legislation and strike
to fill all offices, wherever possible, from the ballot-
box!"
The appeal did not end there. We have cut it at
The appeal did not end there. We have cut it at
that point rely to give the reader a chance to take j
breath between strikes. It went on to say: "Strike
for popular election of Senators! Strike against
an increase of the army, to the end that lib-
erty multiply and flourish! Strike to swell the navy.
that you thereby win the respect of nations, and be-
cause a battleship is your best Embassador! Strike
tc cut down the tariff as the wall behind which pro- |
tection crouches to bushwhack the best welfare of the
people! Tariff is protection, and the latter the seed
of trusts â those combed and curried monsters of j
monopoly. Protection is against commerce, and j
commerce is the very life of reason ami prosperity!
Strike against protection, then, as against original |
sin j
Once more take breath and then resume. The ap-
peal continues: "Strike for an isthmian canal! !
Raleigh once said to Queen Elizabeth, 'Darien is the
key of the world.' On Raleigh's word, with all the j
rest, then, strike for a canal! Strike for the initiative !
and referendum! Strike for it first and strike for it j
last. It is the blow royal, to bring down all the j
rest!"
â . . . 1
Thai is the campaign policy of the new Moses. It
will be noticed that in its general striking to right |
and left it strikes free silver down and out. It will j
be noted also that while the leader has planned well
to get his party to move on out of that Egypt of the
past, he carries them no farther than the wilderness. I
He involves them in a jungle where the wildest ideas :
of Democracy, Populism, socialism and anarchy are.
tangled together in confusion. It would be a lucky
stroke indeed if in the course of the general striking !
any member of the party involved in such a wilder-
ness should strike a path that leads out of it.
;
THE PEACE CONFERENCE AT THE
HAGUE.
THE various sections of the Peace Conference at
The Hague are hard at work, and so far the
converging point of their deliberations appears
. to be the establishment of an international tribunal
j of arbitration, submission to which is to be optional.
i As to details, naturally there is much divergence of
opinion, and suggestions are pouring in from the
representatives of the powers.
It would be premature now to anticipate the prac
: tical outcome of the conference. But the fact that the
! governing nations are deliberating upon the subject
of peace is in itself of deep significance. Un-
I doubtedly, whether a definite scheme or plan is sue-
cessfully formulated or not, the modern tendency to
; arbitrate national disputes that do not involve ques
, tions of existence or of honor will be accelerated.; It
has not been generally observed that the wars of this
century have been less destructive and less expensive
in the aggregate than those of the eighteenth century,
and that peaceable settlements between nations both
in Europe and America have been the rule, even
under exasperating conditions. As a fine writer un-
der the pseudonym of Diplomaticus has pointed out
i there have been many efforts, sincere and insincere,
in the direction of peace. The conception of dis
'â¢ armament was a favorite theme with Frederick the
Great. Napoleon Bonaparte at St. Helena, after
! deluging Europe with blood and decimating the
manhood of France, claimed that his central thought
j had been the extirpation of war by the revival in
! Europe of the Amphictyonic Council of Greece,
which, it may be observed, failed from causes that are
jno less operative in modern times. The Holy Al
i liance of 1815 was ostensibly formed in the interests
,of peace. Louis Napoleon suggested proportional
i disarmament among European powers by a revision
;of treaties. When the treaty of Paris was framed in
1856 Lord Clarendon obtained an ineffective declara
'â  tion in favor of international consultation before acts
of war were perpetrated. Such a covenant was
! adopted in reference to controversies between Turkey
and European states, and in the demands that pre-
ceded the Russo-Turkish war Russia acted as an in-
ternational agent, although in the war itself she was
isolated.
These are familiar instances which illustrate the
fact that, for a century or more, and especially dur-
ing the last eighty years, rulers have had some per-
ception of the ultimate necessity of superceding
armies and navies by negotiation. Although the goal
is still very remote, advances toward it have been
substantial and notable during the last thirty-five
years. The Geneva arbitration between Great Britain
and the United Slates was a substantial movement
j toward lasting amity between the two great English
; speaking nations. The withdrawal of warships from
j the Great Lakes was another guarantee against the
precipitation of hostilities between the same leaders
of modern civilization. The settlement of the
Venezuelan disp\ite still, further aided the cause of
the advocates of peace. In 1800 the Pan-American^
treaty established permanent arbitration between
j seventeen republics, some of them" in South America,
and since that year Great Britain has entered into
' ten treaties of arbitration.
Distant, therefore, though the time may. be when
i the sword is to be broken and the wolf and the lamb
j are to feed together and the lion to eat straw, it can-
not be denied that the proclamation of the Czar and
[the discussions of the Peace Conference accord with
THE SAN FKA^CISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JUNE 11, 1899,
I many premonitory signs. One of the disturbing
j elements, however, is the difficulty of reconciling the
sentimental declarations of the conference with the
acts of the nations of whose representatives it is com-
posed. The first thing a man who repents is expected
to do is to "bring forth works meet for repentance."
This self-evident platitude is most industriously ap-
plied by the pessimists who sneer at the conference.
-Poland, Schleswig-Holstein, Alsace, Lorraine and
Ireland confront Russia, . Austria. Prussia, Germany
i and Great Britain, and, refusing to obliterate history,
! insist that restitution of destroyed nationalities should
| be a condition precedent to a movement for univer
j sal peace. Finland confronts the Czar, who has sent
j a pacific message to the world and simultaneously
j lays his weighty hand upon her autonomy and seeks
to destroy her identity. ' Even the United States is
not exempt from criticism, for the line of demarca
: tion between the acts of the Government and the
pronunciamentos of the imperialists is not clearly un-
derstood.
And yet, in spite of unfavorable omens and incon
sistent conduct, it is a realized fact that, with appro-
priate solemnity and with high intelligence and with
profound learning, the civilized world is discussing
the probability of universal peace, and that there is
j a reasonable prospect of. a slight foreshadowing sue-
cess, of which voluntary arbitration is the converging
; point. It has been -said that Europe wants relief
from war budgets rather than from war, and it is
apparent that a demand for that kind of relief will
I soon exist in our own country. It is doubtful
whether in this direction the conference will prove
1 Helpful. Mr. Goschen, who has charge of the British
budget, proposes "conditional estimates" for military
and naval purposes as an improvement on con-
gresses for the promotion of peace. This means
enormous appropriations, the use of which is to be
regulated by the pacific or belligerent aspect of in-
ternational neighbors. There are many statesmen
and naval and military commanders who
i believe that the . .most expensive preparations
jin peace and* the maximum of destruc
! tiveness ;in war are the best means of ad-
vancing the supreme object of civilization. There are
few who have any faith in bullets that do not kill, in
analogizing battles to French or German duels, or in
the policy of relieving the strain of campaigns by
siestas and .feast days.
It seems probable that the action of the Czar will
not be a total failure, but a measurable success. The
time may be not far distant when pacific suggestions
from imperial sources will be drowned in the demand
from the mass of humanity, and when that day ar
rives progress will be more rapid toward
"The Parliament of Manâ the Federation of the
World."
LOYALTY TO THE GOVERNMENT.
IT should be the aim of every citizen of this repub
lic to keep his country's honor virgin. Nothing
marks more plainly the difference between our
j republic and the monarchies sew-here than this in
! dividual responsibility of the citizen for the character
lof the Government. In a monarchy pledges may be
! broken, faith violated and dishonor run riot, but the
! subjects may remain individually devoted to public
and private virtue. The Russian people are not re-
sponsible for the deep dishonor of their Government
in breaking it- covenant with Finland. That is the
work of the Czar. But if this republic break its
pledges to Cuba, and to the world in the case of the
i Philippines, it will be the dishonor of the people,
1 for the Government is theirs.
I . Already the cry arises that loyalty to the Govern-
ment requires that we support the conquest and for-
I cible annexation of the Philippines, the seizure of
Cuba as soon as we have disarmed her people, and
! the establishment of a military satrapy in Porto
1 Rico. There is but one kind of loyalty to this Gov
-1 ernment, and that requires that the people keep the
Government strictly within its constitutional limita
â  tions. Every man who supports and defends the ex-
ercise by those who administer the government of
powers not derived from the constitution is loyal to
the persons who so trespass, but he is disloyal to the
Government and untrue to the constitution.
This is simply an axiomatic statement. The con
stitution creates the Government and delegates to it
the powers it may exercise. When it claims the right
to powers not so delegated it is guilty of revolution
and has equal right to overthrow the whole consti
tution and proceed to create any kind of government
it may choose.
The Federal courts have never affirmed the consti
tutional rights of the Government to acquire and
hold imperial colonies. On the other hand, this right
has been expressly denied.
The Supreme Court of the United States has de
cided this in precise terms. That court says: "This
brings us to examine by what provision of the con
stitution the present Federal Government, under its
delegated and restricted powers, is authorized to ac-
quire territory outside of the original limits of the
United States, and what power it may exercise there
in over the person and property of a citizen of the
United States, while it remains a Territory add until
it shall be admitted as one of the States of the Union.
There is certainly no power given by the constitution
to the Federal Government to establish or maintain
colonies bordering on the United States, or at a dis
tance, to be ruled and governed at its own pleasure,
nor to enlarge its territorial limits in any way, ex
cept by the admission of new States. That power is
plainly given, and if a new State is admitted it needs
no further legislation by Congress, because the con
stitution itself defines the relative powers and duties
of .the State and the citizens of the State and of the
â Federal Government. But no power is given to re-
quire a territory to be held and governed perma
nently in that character. To acquire territory and
govern it by Congress as it sees fit would be danger
ous to the liberties of the people." Â. - â 
With the principles above laid down, every consti
tutional lawyer and every commentator, from Web
ster to Judge Cooly and Morefield Story, has agreed.
If we are conquesting territory for any other purpose
than its admission as States and people as equal citi
zens we are engaged in an enterprise which no man
can indorse who is loyal to the Government and con
stitution. '

EDITORIAL VARIATIONS.
BY JOHN McNfIUGMT.
It is to be regretted the story from
! Cairo of the death of Jancsi Rigo has
j proven to be false. As a general rule
it is better to kill a story than to wish
! a man dead, but in this case the story
! was so excellent to the whole world,
! while the man is of such little value to
j anything more than a very small and
I fractious fraction, it is hard to avoid
I a feeling of regret that he did not die
i at the very time and in the very way he
was reported to have died.
In the whole realm of Action hardly
anything can be found equal in dra
matic contrast and intensity to that
brief telegram telling how the beauti
ful Princess Chimay lay in a sumptu
| ous villa in the suburbs of Cairo giv
; ing birth to twins, while her wild art-
ist lover reveled, with his friends in joy
' over the event, improvising wonderful
| rhapsodies on his violin, filling the
! Egyptian night with the intoxication of
wine, happiness "and music until the
i dread bubonic plague struck him,
! changed his melodies to liowlings and
< sent his half-drunken company of. rev-
elers squealing home through the dark
i ness, while he lay .dying and beyond
the hearing of the cries of his love call-
ing for him ' continually until her
nurses quieted her with an opiate
sleep.
It was as mad and tragic a tale as
ever was told of love and beauty.
Zola's description of the death of Nana
is as nothing to it. Every incident of
it served so well to point a moral and
adorn a tale; it is a pity it was a lie.
.'-â *": â '"*- â '-.*.'â¢'â¢
Between the publication of the story
of the death of Rigo and its contra-
diction there -were just twenty-four
hours, but that short space was long
enough to give fluent moralists a
chance to preach one more sermon in
the old way upon the old theme, "The
wages of sin is death." They have as-
sumed that the Princess is a sinner,
that her lover is another sinner, that
their love is a very great sin indeed;
and they have preached as if these as-
sumptions were indisputable. One local
moralist went so far as to intimate it
would not be immoral to strangle the
twins, "the innocent, helpless crea
tures" born of that love, in order to
got rid of that much of "the evil that
corrupts and gangrenes humanity."
The chief objection to such assump
tions is that when assumed we lose the
arguments by which they are sup
ported, and it would be interesting to
know -why the Princess and her artist
are sinners any more than some other
folks. Against what, against whom
and in what way do these two dazzling
free livers sin? That they have Jived
according to their own mutual will and
not according to the : will of their
neighbors is true, but may not. their
neighbors be wrong?
If men and women have not a right
to the enjoyment of their own souls
and their own bodies, so long as that
enjoyment injures no one else, to what
have they a right? Society indeed
claims and asserts a right to regulate
the life of every individual; and that
right is not to be' disputed by any one
who lives in' society and accepts its
favors and its benefits; but when one
departs from society and goes .into an-
Other realm to live, Mrs. Grundy has
no more right to pursue and to punish
than Kaiser William would have to ar
rest in the United States some German
who should happen to sing in this
country that "lese majeste" song about
"Meinself und Gott."
* Â» *
If a balance were rightly struck be
tween the Princess Chimay and society,
it would probably be found that society
sinned against her more than she
sinned against it. From all that is
known of her, it is certain nature gave
her many good qualities and infused
them with more than ordinary strength.
She has courage, independence, frank
ness and a sort of undisciplined self
pride that refuses to stoop to hypoc
risy. When she took a lover she left
her husband. She did not lie to him,
nor stain his house by an Intrigue.
Thus while she has defied society and
fought it, she has never cheated it, nor
tried to cheat it.
On the other hand, society cheated
her from the start. It gave her false
ideals of. life. It taught her to believe
that money, rank, title and social pres
tige are the best things the soul can
desire, and that for these everything
else ought to be sacrificed. She be
lieved society. She gave up whatever
there was in her ardent and unexperi
enced girlhood for the title of Princess
and a position in royal drawing rooms
and throne rooms. She found her
Prince to be a scamp, her position a
vanity, the throne rooms a bore, her
existence a continual vexation of spirit.
Society, in fact, had fiimfiammed her.
It had played a confidence game on her.
It promised her golden joys and gave
her a package of brass filings.
Most women under such circum
stances would have stayed in the game
until they had a chance to pull out with
a Belmont or a Vanderbilt, and so go
off with wealth, to start new with the
sanction of the state, the blessing of
the church and the congratulations of
society. This woman didn't play the
game a minute after she found she had
been swindled. She went off with an
artist instead of a millionaire; and for
that offending is dubbed "sinner" in
every land where Mrs. Grundy rules.
It must not be supposed that a justi
fication of the course of the Princess
Chlmay means a condemnation of so
ciety. That would be illogical. If the
Princess has a right to do as she
pleases, then society has also a right
to do as it pleases. If she turn her
back upon the world, the world has a
right to fling bricks at her so long as
none of them hit hard enough to hurt.
No matter how antagonistic two
forces may 'appear to.be in their rela
tions to one another, it is impossible
to completely defend the one without
defending the other, for the world is all
one fabric. No man has a right to deem
himself truly tolerant until he has
learned, to tolerate the intolerances of
others, and the Princess who will not
tolerate Mrs. Grundy is no, better mor
ally, nor any wiser than those who will
not tolerate the Princess. The true
song of toleration is the ditty, "All
coons look alike to me," and everything
human must be regarded as a "coon"
within the meaning of the song. '
Last Saturday a â writer whose sex is
concealed under the norn de plume of
"Yorick"; denounced by all the gods of
mockery, the purpose of San Francisco
to erect a monument to Dewey. What
manner of creature this unburied Yo
-iiclc may ba I know not but as it put
I a foot down upon every one of the hun-
dred arguments in favor of the monu
ment, it is evidently something in thÂ«
nature of a centipede.
That the denunciation was witty goes
without saying, for was there ever a
Yorick who was not fertile of jest and
jibe even when the heart had turned to
clay and the skull was full of dust?
It is the joke of this writer to assert
that in all California there is no artist
capable of designing a monument that
would be creditable to this generation
or an ornament to the city; and he ar
gues therefore we should have no mon
ument.
A falser statement or a more illogical
deduction from it would be difficult to
find. As a matter of fact, California
has better artists in all arts than critics
in any, with the exception of thÂ»
drama, where we are fairly strong in
criticism, but weak in production.
It is good to be witty; it is good to
be anonymous; it is good to be a centi
pede, but it is never good to be ridicu
lous and false at the same time. A norn
de plume may hide from the wrath of
men, but the Yorick should remember
the devil sees it.
:â â ;-â¢â â â  â¢ â¢..
There are other Yoricks than ours,
and all of them are not centipedal nor
given to assuming the names of dead
jesters, though they assume everything
else. One of them has recently arisen
to speak his mind in the East. The
name of him is Herfry B. Fuller, and
he has been described as "the most ar
tistic of Chicagoans," and by a Chicago
paper at that.
In the course of his yorickings this
Yorick said, according to report, that :
"the average American is cheap"; that '
the "texture of the American mind is j
flimsy and whining"; that the "soil of j
American character is light and i
sandy"; that "as Americans we have j
the climate against our artistic aspira- j
tions." He is reported to have said also j
a great deal more of the same kind.
Evidently Mr. Fuller would object to
monuments and would be both flippant
and severe if any were suggested in
Chicago. It is to be noted, however,
that his condemnation of such projects
is based upon different grounds from
those taken by the local Yorick. He
does not deny that we have a few art
ists, but maintains they cannot flourish
because the soil is sandy and the cli
mate bad. On the showing of such
criticism we are much better off than
the metropolis of the lakes. We might
by swapping Yorick get an artist in
exchange, but who can ever hope by
any means to change the climate of
Chicago?
* * *
While we are talking of Dewey, it is
worth noting that in nearly every land
where he may chance to go in Europe
he will be claimed as a long lost son
and find himself furnished with a fam
ily tree proving that his ancestors
hailed from that country and he is a
man of that race.
That the Irish will greet him as a
descendant of their early Kings, and
that the British will welcome him as a
brother Anglo-Saxon are matters of
course. These ' insular pretensions,.
however, will ' not be permitted to go
undisputed. A French authority as
serts, the hero's name was originally
De Houy, and that he is the offspring
of a Huguenot family. The Belgians
trace his descent from a certain De
Wey, and claim to have a record of the
first of the family that came to this
country. The Germans as yet have not
put in a bid, being evidently in doubt
as to what the Kaiser thinks of his
treatment of the German war vessels
at Manila; but in due time we shall
hear from them. When we build our
monument we shall have to make it as
many sided as Yorick has feet in order
to get all the family names on it.
Now that school examinations are
under discussion, a puzzle in the way
of grammatical construction will prob
ably be interesting to a good many peo
ple and therefore it is worth while call
ing attention to the following extract
which the Little Rock Democrat has
exhumed from a brief filed by the At
torney General of Arkansas in the
noted insurance cases which have oc
cupied to so large an extent the at
tention of the people of that common
wealth. It may be stated at the start
that the puzzle lies in disentangling the
pronouns and determining to what they
refer; the other peculiarities of the ex
ample don't count:
"So that we see from this decision
that fire insurance corporations, and
tbe contracts issued by them, stand in
bad odor before the law. They may
exclude them from its borders. They
are neither commodities nor transac
tions of commerce. They are outlaws
upon the face of the earth and the State
in its sovereign capacity nothing! In
the nature of sex they are neuter gen
der, and cannot even propagate itselt
without artificial aid. It is the Wan
dering Jew of business. It cannot enter
a State only as a sneaking robber on
his peril, or by going to the gates of
the commonwealth as a mendicant, and
like Lazarus licking' the sores of the
sovereigns for permission to scavenge."
An Oakland clergyman, the Rev. J.
T. Sunderland, has preached a sermon
upon the theme, "If I "Were Twenty
Again"; has published It in pamphlet
form and circulated it far and wide.
It is a good sermon. It tells many good
things that a middle aged man would
do if he could start over again and live
differently. He would lead a simple,
wholesome life; would make worthy
friends; would read none but good
books; would learn to sing if he could;
would learn to play on some instrument
and would make "a distinct provision
for the joy side of life." All of which
is most excellent. The true moral of
the discourse, however, is one which
the preacher has left out: If all those
good things at 20, why not at 50?"
' All sermons should not be preached
for young men. The chances for im
provement mental or moral are as good
at one age as at another. There is a
familiar story of an old man of "0 who
advised his son to plant an orchard,
but the son would not do so, because
he thought he might move or die be
fore the trees came into bearing.
Thereupon the old man planted an or
chard himself, despite the mocking of
his son 'and his neighbors; and, as the
story goes, he lived to eat fruit and
drink cider made from the fruit of those
trees for many a healthy year. ':A i 'â "'â 
As it was with that apple orchard, so
it ,is with every kind of fruit a man
desires for his enjoyment. The middle
aged man who feels the lack of early
education and finds his faculties dead
ening because he has nothing of music
or art or other provision for the joyous
side of life is wasting time when he
sits down to consider what he would do
if he were 20 again. Seventy is just as
good a time as any to undertake what
ever one really desires at 70.' It is tru|{
that one learns more readily when
young, but it is also true that one re
mains young as long as he continues
to learn. The Oakland preacher should
follow- his sermon "If I Were Twenty
Again" by a sequel with the title,
"When I am a Hundred."

His Death.
U. S. F. S. PHILADELPHIA,
HONOLULU, H. 1., June 1, 1899.
To the Editor of the San Francisco
I Callâ Sir: In some of the Sydney .papers
ati account of the death of Cadet G. G.
. Sweet was j published, j It was copied in
some of the American papers, stating that
he was killed in the battle of Fagall near
: Apia, Samoa. Would you please be kind
enough to publish a denial of the report?
The only officers lost in that battle were
. Lieutenant Lansdale, U. S. X".. Ensign
M< naghan, U. S. N*.. and Lieutenant Com
! mander Freeman. K. X.
The bodies of Lieutenant Lansdale and
Ensign Monaghan are now on this ship,
being brought to San Francisco for
| burial.
The report of my death was a mistake
in setting up, the reporter of the paper
having written that "Cadet Sweet was
the only American officer left at the main
guard at Samoa when his two superior
officers were killed. ' It was construed
into, "Cadet Sweet was the only American
officer left by the main guard in Samoa."
Please rectify this if possible. The
Philadelphia expects to arrive in San
Francisco on the 20th or 21st of June. Very
truly yours.

The Southern Pacific Is to Have a
Little Sideshow of Its Own Rep-
resenting All the Lines
of Its System.
The Southern Pacific of Kentucky is to
have an exhibit and a commissioner all
of its own at the Paris Exposition. Wil
liam H. Mills, land agent of the Central
Pacific, is to be its commissioner, and he
is out now on the first of many trips he
will be â '!:.- to take in seclectlng and
making ready the immense showing the
company has decided to send to Europe.
Since Mr. Mills abruptly declined the
commlssionership from California ten
dered him by Governor Gage there has
been considerable speculation as. to his
reasons for doing so. Mr. Mills said it
was because California had not appro
priated enough money to guarantee a fit
exhibit; others said it was because be did
not countenance some political affiliations
he had been forced into during the re
cent session of the Legislature, and was
resolved, so far as be was personally con
cerned, to accept no remuneration for the
services he had Involuntarily rendered in
the fight of a certain Senatorial aspirant.
Both these conditions may have had
something to do with Mr. Mills' almost
rude refusal wired to Governor Gage, but
the prime reason has become apparent in
the announcement just maae by the com
pany that it will see to it that at least
the sections through which Its lines ex
tend shall be fairly represented.
Mr. Mills left a week ago in his private
car for inland, ostensibly to visit his
daughters, who had preceded him to the
northern town by a few days. He has
not arrived there yet, but has been stop
ping at nearly all of the summer resorts
along his route, as well as the big fruit,
cattle and grain centers, and has minute
ly surveyed the situation, with the new
project in view.

six months to pet the exhibit in such

PACIFIC STATES EXHIBIT
W. H. Mills Has a Project for
Showing Western Products.
W. H. Mills. land agent for the Central
Pacific Railroad, who is about to make
a trip to Paris as Commissioner to the
International Exposition, has evidently
got the exposition fever since his ap
pointment to represent this State in
Europe. If. is a member of the Califor
nia State Board of Trade, which is mak
ing efforts to have a splendid exhibit of
California products at the Pan-American
Exposition which is to be held in Buffalo,
N. V.. in 1901. Mr. Mills is Interested in
this matter, as might be supposed, but
his mind has recently reached out to a
distance far beyond tile original inten
tions Of the other members of the board.
Mr. Mills' latest project is to undertake a
Pacific States Exposition, to be run as a
feature of the exhibit of the products of
California. To this end he lias written
the following letter to the board, which
meets on Tuesday:
* * * I believe that we can induce
Washington and Oregon to join Cali
fornia in a Pacific States Exposition
at "the Pan-American Exposition to be
held in Buffalo in 1901. While in Ore-
gon I intend M see the Governor of the
State and will present the matter to
him in as strong a light as is In my
power. My opinion Is that the three
Pacific Ocean Statesâthat Is, the three
States whose borders are washed by
the waters of the Pacific Oceanâ
also Alaska, might join in what might
be termed a Pacific Ocean exposition.
If it is deemed advisable to add the
interior Statesâ such as Montana, Ne
vada, Idaho, Arizona, etc.â l would not
object.
My plan would be to have these
States represented, each independent
of the others, hut in a single group,
and project at the same time a colonial
exposition relating to the Hawaiian
and Philippine Islands, having the par-
ticipants in the Pacific group of Ameri-
can States hold the Pacific Ocean Ex-
position in common. * * Â»
As has been stated. Mr. Mills is now in
Oregon, and it is believed within a week
or ten days he will be able to inform the
other members of the board what success
he has met with in his interview with the
Governor of the Weofoot State. From all
accounts, his suggestions are likely to be
acted upon favorably at the meeting of
the board on Tuesday. At least the pro
ject will not be condemned until after

CUT DOWN BY THE
RUTHLESS CABLE CAR
Aged Charles Tillson Meets Death by an Accident.
* A T 5:30 o'clock Friday afternoon a Hyde street cable car knocked down
.* A Charles Tillson, an aged painter and formerly a Tax Collector of this
>f. Â£Sk city, inflicting injuries which resulted in death early yesterday morn
* ggQ Ing. Tills.'ii was crossing Hyde street as the car struck him. He fell
X in front of the dummy, "being dragged several feet before the gripman,
<y Robert Holland, could stop the car.
* The case was reported to the Coroner yesterday morning, and an autopsy,
j> held by Dr. Zabala in the afternoon, showed that death was due to a hemor
* rhage of the brain. The car struck Tillson full on his side, throwing him heav
* ily on his back, his head striking the cobbles between the tracks. From the
<5> time of the accident Tillson did not regain consciousness.
f The deceased was a man of temperate habits, and at the time he met the
% death-dealing blow of the ruthless cable car was returning to his home at
<i> 1200 Leavenworth street. He was crossing on Jackson street from west to east.
* According to the opinion of some eye-witnesses the car was slowing down as
1' it reached Jackson street. Tillson approached the tracks of the north bound
% Hyde street car and did not stop, but continued his course. When the car
* caught him he yelled, but it was too late. His body was hurled backward
<S> before the gripman could apply the brakes.
* Tillson was picked up and carried to his home by F. Stromberg. who re
% sides at 1406 Pacific street, in the immediate neighborhood of the accident. Dr.
â¬> I. S. Rosenbaum of the London and Lancashire Insurance Company was on the
* car which collided with Tillson. "I saw him approach the Hyde street tracks
* as the car was slowing," he said last night. "I was on the rear dummy wait
<;â > ing until the car should stop on the other side of the street. Suddenly I heard
* a wild cry. and the car came to a jerky stop. Tillson was not dragged far,
* and I could not tell whether the accident was due to carelessness on his part
* or on the part of the gripman."
* Charles Till: on was a native of Massachusetts and was prominent in local
4> politics in the late '70's and early 'XO's. In 1879 he was elected Tax Collector of
* this city on the Workingman's ticket. Subsequently he ran for other offices,
* but was defeated. He leaves three children, two sons and a married daughter.

A Communication That Will Give
A Communication That Will Give
Majority Members of the Board
of Supervisors Food for
Thought.
The Merchants' Association has ad-
dressed a communication to the Board of
Supervisors relative to the street, railway !
franchises that have been petitioned for
by the Market-street Railway Company.
The association recommends that all of
the franchises and privileges asked for
be denied, with the exception of the so-
called corkscrew privilege and the privi- I
leges and franchises asked for in connec- :
tion with the changing of the motive j
1 power of the present Post-street line. It
: is recommended that the corkscrew line
be compelled to run down Post street
from Taylor, instead of down Geary
street, and that certain limitations as to
the time in which the roads shall be com-
pleted be imposed. The communication j
in full is as follows:
To the Honorable, the Board of Su- !
pervisors of the city and county of San
Franciscoâ Gentlemen: In accordance
with our request of June 2 that your
honorable board defer action until
Monday, June 12. upon the applications
for franchises so as to enable this as
-1 sociation to investigate separately
each request, we beg to report that
each of these franchises has had our
careful consideration.
We beg to favorably recommend the
extension of the Sansome-street line
from its present termination at- Jackson
street northerly to the bay upon cer-
tain conditions specified herein. The
reason for this favorable recommenda
tion upon this particular application
. is that it will carry out the plans con-
templated by this association in here-
tofore recommending the proposed
new electric road to connect Sixth and
Tenth streets, via Post street, with
Montgomery and Sansome streets.
The specific conditions upon which
'we recommend â¢ the above franchise
are as follows:
Firstâ That the time for which the
above franchise is granted, instead of
being fifty years, shall be limited to
and terminate at the same time with
the franchise of the line with which
i it connects expires: ' viz., the year
1929. .
Secondâ That paragraph 5 of section
2 of the proposed ,' order granting the
franchise, which provides simply that
work shall be commenced Within one
year and be completed within three
years, be eliminated and the following
paragraph be inserted in its place:
"Fifthâ That the grantee will, within
six months after the date of this
grant, commence the contsructlon< of
said railway, and continuously there
after, in each and every month until
the completion thereof, expend In such
construction at least the sum of three
thousand ($3000) dollars, and that said
railway shall be completed within not
more than two years after the taking
effect of this order."
We recommend that the application

FIGHT FOR THE CHARTER.
Merchants' Association Resents At-
tacks Upon the New Code.
The members of the Merchants' Associa
tion have rallied to fight the movement
on the part of certain office-holders to de
stroy the new charter. The position of
the association upon this question is well
known, and that the Superintendent of
Streets, or any other politician, should at
tack a creature of the Merchants' Asso
ciation naturally arouses their wrath.
This was manifest at a meeting held yes
terday by that body, at which they ex
pressed themselves In the following pre
amble and resolutions: RaffiS
Whereas, Pursuant to the constitu
tion of California, a municipal charter
, for the City and County of San Fran-
cisco was duly prepared by a lawfully
elected board of freeholders, and lias
been legally ratified by the people of
San Francisco and approved by the
Legislature of the State; and where-
as the Merchants' Association, by a
practically- unanimous vote, favored
the adoption of this new charter and
devoted its earnest efforts to secure
the ratification and final approval of
the same; and whereas, certain legal
proceedings, based upon assumed tech-
nicalities in the law, have been Insti
tuted in the Superior Court of the City
and County of San Francisco for the
purpose of invalidating the entire char-
ter; therefore, be it
Resolved. That the Merchants Asso
ciation hereby expresses its unqualified
disapproval of any such selfish attempt
to defy the will of the people as ex-
pressed In their new organic law.
Resolved, That it is the intention of
the board of directors to take an active
interest in all actions that may be
brought to test the validity of the new-
charter, and. if necessary, to secure
and tender the services of special coun
sel to act In conjunction with the at-
torney of the association in defending
the charter against all legal actions in-
stituted for its nullification.

UNUSUAL FRATERNAL EVENT.
A Young Lady Initiated Into the Or-
der of the Eastern Star by Her
Father and Mother.
For the first time in the history of the
Order of the Eastern Star in this State,
a young lady was initiated into a chapter
of the order by her mother and father,
the one acting as worthy matron and tho
other as worthy patron. This occurred
last Thursday night in Oak Leaf Chapter,
Oakland, and the candidate was Miss
Gertrude, the charming and highly edu
cated daughter of Past Grand Patron
John Bestor Merritt and Mrs. Merritt,
both past officers of the chapter.
When the time for initiation came the
matron and patron of the chapter resigned
their places to Mr. and Mrs. Merritt, and
the young lady was introduced into the
beautiful mysteries of the Eastern Star
with an impresslveness that has seldom
been equaled in a chapter-room. The
ceremony was witnessed by a very large
number of members of the order from the
chapters on the other side of the bay and
by members who belong to the chapters
in this city.
After the ceremony there was an excel
lent collation and congratulations to the
initiate and her parents, and at the close
there were good wishes for a pleasant
journey and speedy return, as on the fol
lowing' day Mr. Merritt and family were
to sail for the Paradise of the Pacific,
which they did. They will remain in the
Hawaiian Islands for several weeks.
RICHMOND IS HAPPY.
The First Avenue Entrance to Golden
Gate Park Is Now Open.
Chairman A. B. Spreckels of the Park
Commission has redeemed his promise to
giva the people, not alone of Richmond,
but the whole city, an opening into Golden
Gate Park at Fulton street and First ave
nue. To obtain this driveway into the
park at this particular point has been one
of the chief objects of the Point Lobos
Improvement Club for a number of years.
Periodical promises were made by the)
Park Commissioners to make this im
provement, but unfortunately these prom
ises invariably were broken. However,
the driveway is now ready for public use,
much to the joy of the Richmondites and
the gratification of President George B.
Fletcher of the Point Lobos Club, who
had given material aid to the work.
In keeping with the progressive spirit
manifested by the owners of property in
improving the streets and avenues on thÂ©
outside section, contracts have been let to
Contractor Felix McHugh for the grading
of Clement street, between Twenty-sec
ond and Twenty-third streets. The same

tract with property owners for the grad
ing and macadamizing of Clement street
from Sixteenth to Eighteenth avenues.

The twelfth annual picnic given under
the auspices of the wholesale merchants
of this city at El Campo yesterday was in
every sense a success. This conclusion is
arrived at both from the large attendance
and from the enthusiasm manifested by
the assembled guests. If there was a
single individual or .1 married one who
die not enter into the spirit of the fes
tivities he discreetly kept himself in the
background! but when it is known that
every one who was there was distinctly
to the fore in the matter of amusement
it is safe to say that "enjoy yourselves"
was the motto of the day and was rlgidly
adhered to. As a result the Child)
Hospital, to which the surplus receipts
will be turned over, will be enriched by
several hundred dollars.
Too much praise cannot be given the va
rious committees who had the affair in
charge. President Henry M. Campe was
Ã¼biquitous in his painstaking efforts to
make everybody feel at home, and he suc
ceeded admirably. Secretary Charles J.
King was tirelessly active in his efforts to
make it pleasant for everybody present.
and their united efforts resulted In over
fifteen hundred people unanimously agree
ing that the outing was one of the most
successful of the season.
Five hundred picnickers Journeyed to El
("an;- on the nrst boat, which left the
ferry at 9:30 o'clock. They went over
with the determination to make* a day of
Jr., and after partaking of the good things
which they had brought over in baskets
and bundles they waited for the guests to
arrive on the afternoon boat, which
reached the pleasure spot at 2 o'clock.
The new-comers swelled the number to
lif teen hundred or more, and the first an
nouncement made was that the children
would be presented with candy. Some
thi cc hundred of the little tots had their
hearts made glad by the proffered dain
ties, and the children of a larger growth
followed suit in the destruction of the
sweets. Dancing to the music of Blan
chard's band was under the direction of
A. A. Ranz.
Among the visitors to the grounds, who
by reason of their official position are
deemed especially worthy of notice, were
School Director Edward Head, who dis
coursed on the beneficent results of a
higher education; Judge Charles T."Conlan, â 
whose legal lore served the assembled mul- |
titude in good stead; "Dan" O'Callaghan,
whose infectious laugh was an inspira
tion to all who came within earshot of it;
"Pop" Floyd, the genial boniface of the
wholesale district on California street,
who remarked that he was tired feeding
the business fraternity and can over to

that was in it. and numerous others who

phases.

RODELD ON DISPATCH TIME.
A Wallet Containing Money Taken
From Under a Mattress While
the Woman Who Lost It
Was Out for Beer.
A. Leovetti, who keeps a fruit store on
Twenty-second street and Potrero avenue,
Is lamenting the loss of $100, which was
taken from under the mattress of his bed
in the rear of the store on last Friday in
dispatch time.
The manner of the theft is described by
Mrs. Leovetti in this way: A new build-
ing is in course of construction alongside
of the one occupied by her and her hus-
band. On the day mentioned she asked
the carpenter who was at work if he
would kindly put up a few little shelves
in the windows upon which fruit might be
placed. The carpenter consented, and
when the shelves were up Mrs. Leovetti
asked him how much he would charge for
the job. His answer was that if she
would "treat" him he would -'call it
square."
Accepting this offer, the lady offered
him some wine, but he suggested that
some steam beer would be more palatable.
Ihe lady started after the amber-colored
liquid, but before doing so she went into
the bedroom to get some change. This
rdie procured from under the mattress and
: then went across the street to the gro
cery store. On her return, and after the
beer had been consumed, the carpenter
FUN AT THE MERCHANTS' PICNIC,
left and she went into the room to put
hark the change. Then to her astonish
ment she found her little wallet contain
ing all the money she had in the world
gone. She spoke to the carpenter about
her loss, but got little satisfaction from
him further than a denial that he knew
anything about the missing money.
After this little episode Leovetti had re
turned from his trip to serve his custom
ers, and on being Informed of the loss of
the money it was decided to inform the
police of the Seventeenth-street station,
which was done, but no results so far
have been accomplished further than the
finding of the empty wallet in a vacant
lot close by.
FIGHTING FOR OFFICE.
Commissioner of Public Works Be- ! ,
fore the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court has issued an alter
nate writ of mandate to State Controller :
E. P. Coigan to show why he should not
pay to Ed E. Leake, as Commissioner of |
Public Works, his salary for the month
of March, amounting to $250. According j
to the petition of Commissioner Leake the
office of public works was created in 1893
and he was appointed and qualified in
ISOS, since which time he has duly and
properly discharged the duties of his po- j
sition. When he presented his demand
for his March salary the Controller re
fused to draw his warrant for the same
upon the ground that the office of Com
missioner of Public Works had terminat- j
ed and no longer existed.
Mr. Leake maintains that it was neces
sary to have the Supreme Court pass !
upon the question of the termination of j
the office, as he would not be satisfied;
with the judgment of an inferior court. I
He asserts that the question should be j
settled soon, as the commission is seri- j
ously crippled and inconvenienced, and
that the interests of the State and people ;
with whom contracts are made are in
volved. _
A few weeks ago Attorney General
Tirey L. Ford wrote an opinion for the. >
Controller in which he upheld the position
of the latter. The mandate proceedings i
will be heard by the Supreme Court on i
July 3. at 2 o'clock.

LOST HER CHILDREN.
The case of Mrs. Rosina de Ctco,
charged with assault to murder in strik
ing her husband Antonio on the head with
an ax on her house on Hinckley alley,
was called in ' Judge Treadwell's court
yesterday morning, but the husband failed
to appear. It was learned that after he
I got possession of the three children last
Wednesday he left for his home in Port
: land.
At the suggestion of Prosecuting Attor
ney Carpenter the Judge Issued a bench
warrant for Clco's arrest and continued
i the case till June 29. He fixed his bonds
in $3000. The wife was released on her
own recognizance, but as soon as she got
; outside she raised such a row by scream
j ing and tearing her hair that* she was
taken to the City Prison. Later she was
sent to the insane ward, in the Receiving
Hospital, where she became calmer ana
was sent home. She is almost crazy with
grief over the loss of her children. Last
Tuesday night, because she thought they
would taken from her, she turned on
the gas in the dormitory in the prison, In-
tending to suffocate them and herself.
Judge Treadwell denounced the police
for giving the children to the husband,
; but on investigation it was found that an
, order of court to that effect was recorded
j last Wednesday, although the Judge said
| his intention was that they should be sent
1 to a public institution.

Residents of the Mission district pro-
Residents of the Mission district pro
pose to carry the war against the South
ern Pacific Company into the enemy's
country, and to this end they have peti
tioned the Board of Supervisors to begin
proceedings in the courts to compel the
corporation to remove its tracks from all
of the streets in the Mission district. The
framers of the petition claim that the
corporation has no warrant of law for its
occupancy of the streets and crossings,
and that it should be compelled to aban
don them.
The recent attempt of the Southern Pa
cific Company to secure rights for a
double track road along the line of its
road to San Jose is the direct cause of
the present movement. Residents of the
district assert that this attempt may be
repeated at any time in the future, and
in order to avert this calamity they now
seek in rid themselves of the danger by
compelling the corporation to remove its
tracks from the public streets, which, it
is claimed, they occupy illegally and
merely by right of sufferance.
The petition is as follows:

ceedings in the name of the city and
county of San Francisco against the

Kentucky for illegally operating a
steam railroad across the public
streets and sidewalks in the Mission
district from Eighth street to the
county line, and

illegally operating a steam boiler and
engine at the corner of Clipper and

your honorable body to compel the
District Attorney to take steps to
abate them by virtue of an act of the

"I have been compelled to stop drink-

me to strengthen up on a cup of her
good coffee. "Well." she said, "that
needn't bother you, for I have Postum
Food Coffee here, which completely
cured a friend of mine of sick head-
aches." I tried her coffee and it was
very good, but when I tried to make it
at home I was disappointed. I soon
found that I was not making it correct-
ly, but by putting in two heaping tea-
spoonfuls of Postum for each person
and letting it boll twenty minutes it
was delicious.
I had at that time been an invalid

my trouble was caused by coffee drink-
ing, of which I was very fond. I im-
mediately began to feel better after
leaving off coffee and using Postum,
and stuck to it. One day I met a lady
who was troubled the same as I was,
and whose appearance on the street
really shocked me, for she was so
emaciated. She exclaimed in surprise
at my improved appearance, and
wanted to know what I had been do-
ing. She asked me if I had had a
healer of any kind. I said, "Yes, I
have allowed Postum Food Coffee to
work the almost complete miracle of
curing me."
My husband has been absent in

Colonel Robinson, chairman of the fire
works committee, received a delegation
from the Mission Improvement Clubs and

The Mission representatives guaranteed
to the fireworks committee a subscription
of several hundred dollars If a fireworks
display were held at Glen Park. The com
mittee will recommend this to the finance
committee to-night. It is their suggestion
to hold two pyrotechnic exhibitions, one in
the Mission and the other in the Western
Addition. "With what may be obtained
from subscriptions the fireworks commit
tee believes that only $800 or $900 Is neces
sary to pay its expenses.
The reception committee met and re
ported progress. The decoration commit
tee will put in Its estimated expense. The
committee wants enough money to decor
ate the two halls at which the literary
exercises will be held, the carriages and
the streets. It will ask for $1000.

SILT WATER
RESERVOIR IS
PETITIONED FOR
Improvement Clubs
Make a Report.
FEASIBILITY OF THE . PLAN
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS MAY
MAY TAKE ACTION.
A Committee of Citizens Looks Over
the Ground and Finds an Avail-
able Site for the
Plant.
The scheme for the construction of a
salt water reservoir for the use of the
city in quenching fires and Hushing sew
ers has been taken up by the residents of
the Mission district. The matter was
called to the attention of the Board of
Supervisors yesterday through the me
dium of a report made to the Eureka Val
ley Improvement Club by a committee of
citizens recently appointed for the pur
pose of investigating the natural facilities
for the construction of such a reservoir.
The report of the committee, which also
contains certain recommendations, was
submitted to the board in its entirety. It
is as follows:
To Market-street and Eureka Valley
Improvement ClubâGentlemen: Your
committee on salt water reservoir beg
leave to report that they visited the
proposed site as suggested by Mr.
Koerner and laid before the Super-
visors in 1894. The proposed site, viz.:
Rocky Canyon, is situated on tie- east
side of the divide between the Pacific
Ocean watershed ami the San Fran-
cisco Bay watershed, and is bounded
by Stanford Heights and Corbett road,
is just above Glen Park and is the
source of Islais Creek.
By a dam at the mouth of* the
canyon, which Is quite narrow and
flanked by masses of rock, a tine lake
of salt water could be obtained of in-
valuable service in flushing sewers,
quenching tires and for bathing and
boating purposes. '..-
The salt water from the ocean could
be pumped up by wave or other power
into this reservoir, whence the pres-
sure from this height would be strong
enough to thoroughly clean out our
whole system of sewers and for the ex-
tinguishing of tires without the aid of
fire engines, and by the means of the
natural main drain of tslais Creek and
a main sewer around the Eastern slope.
of Twin Peaks into Market street and
down that street to the bay. Being on
the divide, both watersheds would be
thoroughly flushed at all times.
This scheme is, we believe, worthy of
serious consideration, especially at
this time, when the Sewer Commission
is about to continue its labors. We re-
port, therefore, that a proper petition
be drawn up and presented to the
Board of Supervisors, bo that the mat-
ter may become public property and
come before the Sewer Commission in
an official shape, and so that they
could obtain more definite data con-
cerning the matter. We also recom-
mend that the scheme be brought be-
fore the Federation of Mission Im
provement Clubs and the other im
provement clubs of the city as a mat-
ter concerning the general welfare.
This communication carries the writ-
ten indorsement of the officials of the
Eureka Valley Improvement Club and
the Federation of Mission Improve-
ment Clubs.

TO PREVENT FUTURE
SCARCITY OF WATER
GIGANTIC SCHEME FOR IM-
POUNDING THE SURPLUS.
A Convents of Influential Men,
Looking Oniy to the Welfare of
California, to Be Called.
A number 'of wealthy and influential
gentlemen of this city have undertaKen
to call a convention for the purpose cf
starting one of the greatest movements
for the benefit of the entire State that
has ever been placed before the public.
The proposition is to build reservoirs tor
the storage of the flood waters to be used
in times when water is scarce or certain
sections are threatened with a drought.
To make the proper start the co-operation
of all large commercial and industrial
bodies Is necessary, and to this end the
promoters have issued the following let
ter The replies of ail receiving the same
have been favorable, and a convention iB
likely to be called In a short time:
Gentlemen: The drought of IS9S cost
the State of California over (40,000,000.
For twenty-five years we have applied
to the National Legislature without
relief. It refuses to regard the ques
tion as a national one. No Interstate
questions are involved In the sources
of water supply of our State, as such
sources are almost within our geo-
graphical boundaries. There is, then -
fore, no reason why we should expect
aid from the National Government ex-
cept possibly in assisting to regulate
â¢ the How of the few streams In the
State which are called navigable and
which would come strictly within the
purposes and spirit of the river and
harbor bill. Of late years the atten
tion of the National Legislature has
been turned toward the irrigation i>y
storage reservoirs of lands still owned
by the United States. We have no such
lands of any appreciable amount in
this State, therefore our chances of
relief from this quarter are less, in
our opinion, than they were years ago.
If we wait for it we will all be dead be-
fore ii comes.
"Private capital will not invest in
storage reservoirs, as the return must
be small or the public oppressed. The
Wright Irrigation act has been a prac
tical failure. Moreover, the control
exercised by the Boards of Supervisors
over such investments frightens pri
vate capital.
With State control, over its winter
flood water California is capable of
supporting 10,000,000 people or more.
The possibility of drought and uncer
tainty of crops deters home seekers
from coming here. The State should
step in and at once. Its powers are
ample. ii alone possesses adequate
powers. There is no reason why Cali
fornia should not do what France,
Egypt, Lombardy and India have al-
ready done and done successfully.
We believe that the State has the
remedy in its own hands and that it
must now take up the question of the
storage of flood waters as the only
means of its future salvation.
In our opinion San Francisco should
take the initiative in putting such a
plan into practical operation. It should
convince the people resident in the
country that it recognizes the fact
that Its very existence depends upon
the success of the country, and that It
Is willing, even eager, to assume its
proportion of a temporary burden
which will result In a direct benefit to
the State at large.
When early this year another dry
season seemed imminent we devoted
serious consideration to this matter.
Several informal conferences were held.
Data were also collected convincing us
that it would require only a beginning
of disinterested, sincere and earnest
men to inaugurate a movement that
would start a gigantic but perfectly
feasible plan to a successful termina
tion.
All the plan needs behind it Is Influ
ence, energy, patriotism and removal
from jobbery and theft. The movement
must be non-partisan and with such
force behind it as to prevent it from
frilling into the hands of politicians.
The undertaking Is gigantic, but prac
tical and feasible.
And for this purpose we propose to
call a convention at an early date in
this city, the delegates to be selected
as representative men from the cities
and towns of the State, and invite you
to Join officially in the call for such
convention. The object of such con-
vention will he to adopt a definite,
practical plan by which the State may
impound its flood waters and distrib
ute them during the seasons of low
water at reasonable rates.
We cannot state definitely as yet
what that practical plan may be. That
must be lfrft to the combined study and
wisdom of the delegates. â 
We have addressed a similar invita
tion to other influential bodies of this
city. At a joint conference the Cali
fornia Water and Forest Society haa
alrendv agreed to co-operate with us.
Bespeaking your early attention to
this invitation, we have the honor to
remain yours very truly.

OFFICE-HOLDERS CENSURED.
Efforts to Break the Charter Strongly
Condemned by Republicans.
At a meeting of the Republican Club of
the Thirty-seventh Assembly District held
last night at Rolando's Hall, resolutions
were adopted censuring and condemning
those Republican office-holders who are
attempting to break the charter in order
that they may hold office for a longer pe
riod â¢ than they agreed to in their pre
election pledges. The resolutions adopted
were as follows:
Whereas, There are certain municipal
officers who were elected on the Re-
publican ticket at the last election who
at the time of their nomination
pledged themselves in favor of sup-
porting the new charter as adopted by
the people at a regular election pre-
viously and regularly held; and
Whereas, The said office-holders are
now trying to nullify its provisions by
commencing actions in the courts of
this State for the purpose of molding a
longer term than they agreed to;
Resolved, That we. as Republicans,
condemn the actions of said office-hold-
ers as false, deceitful and violative of
the principles of the Republican party
and Its platform, upon which they took
the pledge to support the new charter.
Resolved, That we condemn the sys
tem of creating county committeemen
by what is known as the blanket
method.

The Juror Was Prejudiced.
Frank Miller, who was convicted of
murder in Lassen County and sentenced
to imprisonment for life, is to have an
other opportunity for his liberty. He ap
pealed from the judgment and order on
the ground that he did not have a fair
and Impartial trial. The Supreme Court
in reviewing the case found that the jury
was not of such men as most persons ac
cused of crime \ would like to have try
their cases, One* in particular was clearly
prejudiced from what he bad heard and
read about the killing, and the higher
court thought that the challenge of this
juror should have been allowed, as the
man's admissions showed that he was
disqualified from sitting at the trial. For
this reason the judgment was reversed
and the case sent back for a new trial.

TRIED TO END
A LIFE OF WORRY
AND SUFFERING
Miss Kathryne Griffin
Swallows Poison.
WAS A TELEPHONE GIRL
PROMPT TREATMENT SAVED
HER YOUNG LIFE.
â¢
Her Pathetic Story of a Broken
Her Pathetic Story of a Broken
Home, Loss of Employment
and Many Disappoint-
ments â Will Recover.
Having lost her position in the telephone
company through a trivial error and be
ing without funds Kathryne Griffin, a pro
possessing young woman, attempted to
end her cares and disappointments by
swallowing: the contents of a bottle of car
bolic acid last night, and is now lying at
the Receiving Hospital in a precarious
condition.
The unfortunate girl was found on the
sidewalk on Golden Gate avenue, near
Steiner street, by passing pedestrians. She
was lying on her face, with her hands
gripped together. A bottle containing a
small quantity of the deadly fluid by her
side showed what she had done. Officer
Prendergast was notified, and after seeing
the girl's plight rushed to the patrol dox
and rang for the ambulance, but In the
meantime Frank J. Eagan, who was out
driving with his wife, volunteered to take
the lady to the hospital. His wife left
the buggy, and with the assistance of Al
fred Beecher, Eagan hurriedly drove her
to the hospital. On her arrival at the
latter place she was in a semi-conscious
condition. Dr. Tormey administered the
usual remedies and had her put to bed.
In her purse were found two letters.
One was addressed to a Miss Helen Doyle,
2."> Vincennes avenue, Chicago, 111. Tho
contents of the epistle disclosed the rea
son of her attempt to end her life. She
Informed Miss Doyle, who is evidently a
relative, that she had been discharged
from the telephone company for giving a
Stockton operator a free switch. She also
said that her mother was drinking heavily
and had a short time ago been imprisoned
for her libations. In concluding the poor
girl told of her visit to the president of
the telephone company and of appealing
to him to be reinstated, as there wore a
number of sisters dependent on her for
support. She also stated that her appeal
was unsuccessful, and her room rent was
due in a few days. She gave no indica
tion of her purpose to end it all, but ap
parently intended conveying to her rela
tive her sore straits.
Miss Griffin is only 19 years old and is
refined in her manner. She stated that
she had <nnly been in the city seven
months, and during that time was paying
her board and lodging at 640 Harrison
street and also contributed to the welfare
of a brother and sister, who were in a
private institution on Seventh street, they
having been taken a"way from her mother
on account of the latter's habits.
Miss Griffin said she had received her
education in St. Mary's Academy, Monroe,
Mich. On graduating she went to her
grandmother's home In Chicago, and after
a short stay came to this city to 101 l her
mother. She was astonished to find her
parent in a maudlin state. She did every
thing in her power to cure her mother of
the craving for liquor, but without suc
cess. The latter has been arrested twice
for drunkenness, and the daughter was
compelled to leave their home at 626 Lo
cust avenue. Last night, while particu
larly despondent, she left her lodgings
and walked far out in the Western Addi
tion. She decided then to die, and walked
Into Joseph Warren's drug store, corner
of McAllister and Fillmore streets, and
purchased a bottle of the poison.
At a late hour Dr. Tormey pronounced
Miss Griffin out of danger. She promised
not to do it auain. and said she would
make every effort to reach her grand
mother.
Salvation Army Children.
There was quite a gathering of the chil
dren belonging to the Salvation Army at
the army's headquarters on Market street
last night. It has been the custom of the
army to collect the little ones of the corps
annually for the purpose of hearing from
them what they have learned during the
year.
At the meeting last night there were
representatives from Oakland, Berkeley
and San Francisco. The youngsters ac
quitted themselves with credit to them
selves and their instructors.
$45 will buy one of the new style 4 Olym
pia music boxes at Mauvais', 769 Market

ing in such luxuries as a ball game. But
notwithstanding those who were present
taw ,i nice, clean game, somewhat Blow at
times to be sure, but with patches of Dril
liant work both in the field and at bat
that made 11 altogether enjoyable.
And the Statesmen won. The unfortu
nate young men who are compelled by
stern necessity to play ball with a beer
sign plastered on their breasts have gin
gered up wonderfully since their last ap
pearance here. Rumor has it that they
have abuut determined to follow the . x
ample set by their colleagues in San Jose
and pluck from their bosoms the hateful
legend that identifies them with a brew
ery, and their approaching emancipation
may have much to do with their friski
ness. They say that if this thing contin
ues next season their backs will be
adorned with a schooner of sharp steam,
with the accompanying V.
However that may be, the acquisition of
big Ed Hutchinson, who played the initial
bag yesterday as he did in the old days,
and the placing of Sheehan at third and
McLaughlin in left, made a great im
provement In the team, and the boys
played ball that is going to dispel their
noodoo it they keep it up. Except in two
Innings Doyle was an enigma the locals
â were totally unable to solve, and as it was,
with three hits to their credit in the
ninth, they could only score one run.
Sheehan, while charged with three errors,
made some astonishing catches, stops ana
throws, and as soon as he becomes better
acquainted with the position will equal
the best of them.
San Francisco played its usual steady
game, but [berg was touched up in a
lively manner. The one great fault with
both teams, and in fact with all the teams
In the league, is the frequent idiotic at
tempts to bunt. Bunting is a science that
not more than three batters in California
have mastered, and to see a great big
lobster go up and pop up a fly to catcher
or pitcher, or else force a double play
with not one chance In a hundred of his
doing any good, whereby hitting it out he
might accomplish something, gives the
spectators that tired feeling to an alarm-
ing extent. No man should be permitted
to attempt to bunt until he is able to
place the ball just where he wants to.
"For four innings not a run was scored
but in the fifth the Senators, with two
men out. developed a hatting streak and
slugged out three tallies. Hutchinson
opened with a single, but was forced at
second by Harvey, who in turn was forced
by Doyle, who went to second on Sulli-
van's error that spoiled a double play.
Kagan'a long single to center scoied
Doyle, Truck moving up on the throw in.
Stanley was given a pass and both scored
en .Italian's drive to the flagpole. Shan-
ahan also got home, but as he failed to
touch second base he was called out. Sac-
ramento's fourth run was made in the
following inning, and as before, after two
men were out. Sheehan hit safe, was ad-
vanced on Hutchinson's pass and scored
on Harvey's single.
The locals got two In the seventh. Sulli
van opened with a single and was sent
home by Hilderbrandt's double, the latter
going to third on the throw in and home
on Eagan's error, Truck receiving the ball
frcm Shanahan, and, instead of throwing
the- runner out at third, which he could
easily have done, made a bad throw to
the plate in an impossible attempt to
pinch Sullivan. Their last run came in the
ninth. With one out. Hilderbrandt singled
and moved up a notch on Muller's safety,
but was snapped out at third by Doyle,
who made a nice stop of O'Neil's hot
.grounder. Swindells hit to right, scoring
Muller, but O'Neil was caught trying for
third and the game ended as follows: .

Dudes proved easy game for Farmer j
Struve's Sugar Beets to-day. Their heavy '
stickers were unable to do much with
"Jlmmie" Whelan's delivery, while Rus-
sell was touched up for hits when they
were needed. Courtney found him for
two two-baggers. The star play of the
game was Hammond's wonderful run and
catch of a long fly from McCarthy's bat
i to deep left field. Oakland's errors were
! costly, and Rice's error was responsible
for the only run made by the Dudes. '

in the Project.
Men interested in coursing believe they
have hit upon a scheme whereby they
may race their greyhounds in this county
without being subject to the restrictions
i regulating betting imposed by the Super-
I visors. A new park is being arranged on
the county line, a part being in this
j county and the remainder In San Mateo.
The dogs will race in San Francisco, while
the men will bet upon them in San Mateo
County.
The site was once the Casserly Park,
I on the old Mission road, and when cours
! ing was in Its infancy the sport was pro
j moted there by a group of enthusiasts.
The old stands that offered protection to
j a handful of spectators arc still there, but
in recent years have been turned to more
i utilitarian uses and are used as store
i houses. The field has been used for years
as a vegetable garden. The persons who
i had it leased for this purpose were not
; Inclined to give way to the coursing men
until they were well paid for abandoning
1 it.
Laborers have been working on the field
j for some time grubbing out the vegetables
| and have cleared the major portion of it,
completely changing the appearance of
' the locality. The ground is sharply out
: lined against the green fields and hills
: with which it is surrounded. k
The moving spirit behind the enterprise
is Manager Black, who conducted the
park at Los Angeles. The authorities
; cl( sed this recently and Mr. Black at
once cast envious eyes on the field here.
He is said to be backed by local capital-
ists, who have never been identified with
the sport. If Ingleside Park is not opened
shortly it is possible some of the officials
who were acting there may be seen at the
new park.
For some reason the utmost secrecy has
been observed about the new venture.
Men in position to know deny all knowl
edge of the matter, although when pressed
they admit a new field for coursing is
being prepared. It should be ready for
business within the next two months.

GRAND PARLOR TO MEET IN
STOCKTON NEXT TUESDAY
Some of the Prominent Candidates for Offices in the !
Governing Body of the Native Daughters. '
NEXT Tuesday the Grand Parlor of the Native Daughters of the Golden -
West will meet in annual session in the city of Stockton. As to the man- <
ncr in which the grand officers rid the delegates to the parlor will be '
entertained by the members of Joaquin Parlor No. 5, which is the home .
i parlor of Mrs. Lena Hilke Mills, the grand president, mis has already been (
â¢ told in The ill.
i The session promises to he an unusually interesting one, as there are a <
number of matt to present for consideration that will affect the member- '
1 ship at In rge. There will be a move in the direction of expanding the order in '
the State and to Increase its usefulness, for there are many who are of tho '
' opinion that an organization that does so much for so little In the way of car- ;
| Ing for tho members in moments of sickness and in adversity, paying the last .
sad rites to the departed and revering their memories, should have a greater .
i membership thnn it has at this time: that the numerical strength shot be s
twice what it is now, namely, about 8500. â¢
1 The ritual of the order, which was adopted at the previous session of the (
Grand Parlor and which has been pronounced as an aggregation of charges
that are made ui_ of most beautiful thoughts, has been found to be burden- (
some by reason of the fact that these charges, which the officers are required
to memorize, are of too great a length. It has been discovered in practice that (
to rend these charges from the book destroy? the effect intended to be con- *
veyed to the mind of the candidate. So an effort will be made to either re- <
duce the length of the several charges or Introduce an entirely new rtiual. '
Several members of the order have for some time past been engaged In ar- '
ranging rituals which they believe will meet the requirements of the order.
The Native Daughters' Home opened in this city in the early part of last (
January will come up for consideration. During the session its purpose will be
fully explained to the --rates, many being members of the order who in the
past have never represented their parlor in the Grand Parlor. There will be i
introduced some measures to maintain the home so that it shall become what â¢
the founders of it intended a place where Native Daughters coming to San <
Francisco and wishing to avoid the publicity of hotels i ill find a quiet, com- â¢
fortable retreat, where they can feel that they are in a real home. It is also '
to be a place where those members of the order stricken by sickness and be- '
ing without a home in the broadest sense of the word, not wishing to go to a
hospital, will find all the" treatment, care and tenderness that sisterly love can i
bestow on one afflicted. To what extent that has already been done in the
home will he laid before the delegates. <
The election of grand officers for the coming parlor year will occupy con-
siderable attention, and it is expected that there will be a great deal of work '
done in the interest of several candidates. Mrs. _,ena Hilke Mills will, of
course, become the past president. In the natural course of events Mrs. Cora '
B. Sifford of Ventura will become the next president, for that honor is al-
ways conceded to the one who for the year preceding has held the office of '
vice president. Mrs. W. A. Gett of Sacarmento and Mrs. Genevieve Baker of
San Francisco are announced as candidates for the office of vice president, ana '
it is stated that Miss Eliza D. Keith of San Francisco, who some time ago oe-
clared that she would not be a candidate for that office, and Mrs. ...la S. Cam- '
inetti of racks .... of as possible candidates for grand vice pre
dent, but it is generally believed that the contest wfll narrow down to the first
two named For secretary Mrs. Geo rgle C. Ryan is named, and thus far no <
one has been named in opposition to her. Miss Lizzie Douglass of San Fran-
cisco is a candidate for re-election as grand treasurer. There has been some I
t;ilk that Miss Lily O. Reichling, the founder of the. order, may be named -
against her. but "that Is only talk," so say those who claim to know. But *
there is a member of a San Francisco parlor who is to be a candidate for ',
some office, but those who are "managing her fight" will neither give her ..
name nor the office for which she will make a contest. It is thought by many (
that it will be for the office of treasurer. Mrs. Lena Bee Mills of San Fran- â 
Cisco, at present marshal, says that she is a candidate for an office, but will <
not announce which one until she can satisfy herself that' there is a, possibil- *
ity. of winning, and if she does not gain the favorable information bW expects, '
that he will be a candidate for re-election to her present position. Miss Daisy "
Kemp of Ferndale. at present outside sentinel, is spoken of as a candidate for <
inside sentinel, and for onnonent she has Mrs. Emma Swaney of Oakland. -
Should Mrs. Swaney*- ambition for that office not be gratified, she will be a i
candidate for outside sentinel. Miss Eliza D. Keith. Miss Laura J. """rakes -
of Sutter Creek and Mrs. Belle Douglass of Nevada City are mentioned as <
candidates for trustees, although it is expected that there will be a number -
who will want that honor. <
Many of the San Francisco delegation will leave by boat this morning, '
Past Presidents Mrs. Mary E. Tillman and Mrs. Belle \v. Conrad being '
among the number. Many will go in the afternon in Buena Vista Parlor's pri- (
vate car.

instance that occurred in the Grand Hotel
recently, when Chandler demanded $5
from' a well-known citizen, and because it
was refused he used insulting language
and struck the citizen in the mouth.
The Judge convicted Chandler, and re
marked that men like him. who preferred
to beg money from reputable citizens
rather than work, and insulted them,
should not be allowed to live in the city.
He ordered â¢ ('handler to appear for sen

General Shafter Has Ordered the
Commanders of Posts Around
the Bay to Fire a Salute
Bunker Hill Day.
General Shafter is busy these days giv
ing his personal supervision to the out
fitting of the expedition which is to sail
the last of this month for Alaska under
Colonel Ray. This expedition is practi
cally the first of its kind that has ever
been sent to Alaska by the War Depart
ment. While it is not the first body of
troops that has been sent, it is. the
largest, and the plans for its occupancy
are the most elaborate, while the scope of
the expedition Is the most extensive of
any that has ever yet Inhabited the re
gion of Ice and snow. Colonel Kay will
take with him thirty pack horses and six
teen work oxen. The first thing that he
has been instructed to do on reaching
Alaska is to build suitable posts and
quarters for the soldiers. To this end
Colonel Ray will take with him a large
force of mechanics and several sawmills.
Of course, as is to be expected, these
posts will be more or less primitive, as
much of the material has to be carried
to Alaska, but it is the intention of Col
onel Ray to make them as comfortable
as possible for the men. One of the posts
will have to be built of stone, as at the
place where it is proposed to erect it there
is no wood to be had.
Acting under instructions from tho "War
Department the quartermaster's depart
ment has chartered the freight steamer
Wyefield for transport service between
San Francisco and Manila. This vessel
has a capacity of 7000 tons. She will be
loaded with medical and subsistence sup
plies, and will sail within the next two
weeks.
First Lieutenant John O'Shea, Fourth
Cavalry, who took a number of mules to
Manila on the Tacoma, has been ordered
to return here on the same vessel for the
purpose of taking the horses of th"
Fourth Cavalry to the Philippines.
Those officers of the Eighth Infantry
who have been in Alaska on an exploring
expedition have been ordered here to re
join their regiment, preparatory to po
int; to Manila. The Eighth is now in Ha
vana, but has been ordered to the Philip
pines. It will take some time before it
can reach here.

alry, has resumed work in connection
with the Yosemite Park Commission.
Captain Benson was on duty in Cuba. .

Mason and the Presidio tit midday on

KILLING OF SEALS
WILL BE RESUMED
ROOKERIES OFF FEDERAL LAND
WILL SUFFER.
State Commissioners Astonished That
National Officers Should Inter-
fere With the Work.
There has been considerable speculation
on the part of the members of the State
1 Fish Commission as to who was responsi
ble for the rescinding by Washington of
; ficials of the order permitting their depu-
ties to thin out the sea Hon herds
: on the rookeries on the lighthouse reser
vations. That a few Eastern sentimental
, ists had a hand in it was conceded, but
there was much surprise in the Commis
sioner's office yesterday Upon the receipt of
a letter from the Navy Department to
Inspector Sebrees of the lighthouse divis-
ion of this State, which reads as follows:
Referring to your letter of April 21
and the board's reply of April 27, rela
tive to the killing of the sea lions,
and the board's telegram of May 31
suspending the authority given you to
permit the California Fish Commission
to send deputies to certain lighthouse
reservations for the purpose of thin-
ning out the herds of sea lions which
congregate there, the board states
that this suspension of such authority
i was made because of letters of protest
1 received from the United States Fish
r Commission, the honorable the Secre
tary of Agriculture, C. O. Wilson,
the president of the League of Ameri-
can Sportsmen, and William T. Horn-
aday, director of the Zoological Park
of New York City. The matter will be
, considered by the board at its quar
terly meeting, which will take place
next Monday, and the board requests
you to so inform the California Fish
Commission.
That the United States Fish Commis
sioners and the Department of Agricul
ture should interfere with the work of the
California officials was a surprise. A tele-
gram from Washington states that the
board mentioned held a meeting on the
sth Inst, and derided to stop all Rilling of
sea lions on Government property. How-
ever this will not stop the killing alto-
gether. Captain Scott Is now slaying
these leasts at the Purissimo rookeries,
ten miles south of Half-moon Bay, and
Ihe finds enough to keep him busy. On
: Monday Deputy Ai Wilson will go to the
big rookeries at Point Arena, where the
; facilities for thinning out the herds Is al-
most as good as at ' the Farallones or
Point New Year. â "-/â¢-' V->v-?,
Recent investigation into the habits of
these marine creatures leads to the belief
that the brown or barking seals are the
, most destructive. These fellows are the
ones that enter the bay and go tip the
rivers. More of them are to be found on
the Point Arena rookeries than anywhere
else.
Preparing for McKinley.
At the meeting of the Ohio Society of
California to be held next Wednesday-
night in the Red Men's building the mem
bership will further discuss the arrange
ments that have been made to tender a
reception to President McKinley. on the
occasion of his visit to this city. The mem
bers are very enthusiastic over the ap
proaching event and they are determined
to show that although the; President will
be away from his native State he will bo

natives of the Buckeye State who will

TOUR OF THE WORLD
Captain and Mrs. Charles Goodall Started
for Europe Yesterday Afternoon.
CAPTAIN Charles Goodall, senior member of the firm of Goodall, Per-
kins & Co., accompanied by Mrs. Goodall, started last evening for
Europe. They took the overland train and a large party of their rela
tives and friends accompanied them as far as the Sixteenth-street sta
tion, Oakland. After a stop of a few days in New York. Captain and Mrs.
Goodall will take the steamer New York for England on June 21. They were
to have gone on the Paris, but the wreck of that vessel necessitated the sub
stitution of the New York.
Captain Gtodall does not know how long he will remain abroad. He says
the length of the trip depends . altogether upon his health. His first visit
will be to his old home in Draycott, Somersetshire, England. His uncle, Sam
uel Goodall, now 88 years of age, is still alive and hearty. The uncle was the
village schoolmaster and was not very many years older than the pupil.
After a long stay in Draycott, the home of Mrs. Goodall In Wales will
be visited. Mrs. Goodall also has an uncle living. His name is David Roberts,
and he will give his niece and her husband a hearty welcome When all
their remaining relatives have been visited Captain* and Mrs. Goodall will
roam all over Great Britain and Ireland. They will cross over to France and
will make a tour of Germany and -Italy. Other countries may be visited and
the couple may come home by way of China, Japan and Hawaii, but, as be
fore stated, that denends UDon the health of Captain and Mrs. Goodall.

particular you need the aid of some one who has known ability
in curing just such troubles as yours.
DR. MEYERS & CO. offer you knowledge and skill that
cannot be obtained elsewhere. If you have any of the fol-
lowing symptoms you should get their advice:
A pasty, thickened skin, pimples and blackheads; eyes
lose their brilliancy, they grow hollow, languid, misty, fur-
tive, pupils dilated and sight enfeebled; lips lose their color;
teeth decay; breath becomes strong and fetid. Expression of
face Stupid and melancholy; manners betray embarrassment

ing at Oakland July 4.

Driving Association held an interesting:
meeting yesterday, E. 11. Aigeltinger pre
siding and Fred Thompson acting as. sec
retary. After a prolonged discussion, dur
ing which the eighty members present
displayed lively interest, it was decided
to hold the annual races of the association
at the Oakland track on .July i.
It was also decided that only members
of the association would be permitted to

cided to expel any member who entered a

agreed that the 'lay's sport should consist
of Aye trotting and pacing races, for
purses of WOO each. $60 to go to the first
horse. There will be a special race for
th< butchers who are members of the as
sociation and also for the "green class."
for which F. G. 1 1' Kane offers a silver
challenge cup valued at $100.
Vice. President Aigeltlnger reported that
local horsemen were showing great inter
est in the arrangements for the establish
ment of a mile track for the exclusive use
of the association. He predicted that the
next annual meeting of the local drivers
would be li- Id on their own track.
The following committees were appoint
ed to arrange the meeting on the Fourth

KILLED AT HIS TRIAL.
Tom Baker Shot and the Militia
Quells the Disturbance. -; j
MANCHESTER, Ky., June Dur
ing the trail of Tom Baker to-day. there
were serious disturbances and one man
is reported killed, and several reported
wounded. The militia quelled the dis
turbance, dispersing the crowds when
the Gatling gun was brought out.- .'-;â --
For days the court has been hearing
arguments in the motion for change of
venue, and the motion was granted to
day, whereupon court adjourned. Tom
Baker, the defendant, was "still out on
bail, and as he was leaving the. court
house with: the crowd he was shot dead.
It is said the shot -came from ; a -rifle |
in a window of the Sheriff's office, but
that report may be due to the fact that
Baker was charged with the murder of
Will White, a brother of Sheriff White.
But all advices agree, that Tom Baker
dropped dead from a shot as he was
passing the Sheriff's place. The militia
are reported to have immediately sur
rounded the body of Tom Baker and
protected it and his friends, but in do
ing, so they were compelled to bring the
Gatling gun and disperse the crowd.

trial to-day to deny the charges made by
"Print Rhodes yesterday afternoon that
Llewellyn had threatened to blow up
Lee's house with dynamite. He was called
for rebuttal, but did not answer and new
messenger was sent for him. Neverthe
less the rebuttal evidence of the prosecu
tion was devoted almost entirely to an at
tempt to vindicate the ex-Legislature.

had been for the purpose of establishing

ter charges and several plots to murder

Brannigan, Carl Claussen. Jack Fountain

that bandits are causing much destruc

CRUISER NEWARK SAFE.
WASHINGTON, June 10.â cruiser
! Newark has been heard from and is un
; doubtedly safe. The following dispatch
was received this afternoon at the Navy
! Department:
"MONTEVIDEO. June 10.â Secretary
Navy, Washington: The purser of a
steamer of the Pacific Steam Navigation.
Company which arrived at Montevideo on
June 2 saw the Newark enter Sandy Point
May 28. * COLBY."
The signer of the dispatch Is- Comman-
I der Harrison G. Colby, captain of the
Marblehead, which is following the New
'â  ark around South America, and who has
: recently arrived at Montevideo, himself.
It is the opinion of the naval officers at
; the department that the Newark met
with bad weather on the way south from
Montevideo and was perhaps driven out
of her course, so that she. was greatly
delayed in getting into the Straits of Ma
gellan. However, as she was near Sandy
Point on May 28, only twelve days ago,
; and certainly stopped in the straits sev
â  eral days to coal, she is now no longer
overdue at Valparaiso.

OAKLAND, June 10.â On several occasions during the past three months
The Call has directed the attention of the Supervisors to the notorious

mand The County License Inspector was called before the board and ap

LICKED ALBERT EDWARD.
James Millar Says That the Honor
Belongs to Him.
OAKLAND, June James Millar,
proprietor of the East Oakland Pottery,
claims the honor of being the first and
perhaps the only human being to lick the i
Prince of Wales. Millar says the incident'
occurred many years ago at Portobello, a
little town on the Firth of Forth, Scot-
land. "We were mere kids then, I and the
| Prince of Wales," says Millar, "and we
I quarreled over my donkey. The Prince
! wanted it. and being too young to under-]
' stand that he could not have everything
'in sight, he proceeded to take it and
| pulled me off its back.- Then before he

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
-OS Broadway, June 10.
Five lads varying in age from 7 to 11
; led the police and Sheriff's office of two
counties a merry dance this afternoon.
This morning George Roeth, president of
the Eagle Box Works, drove in from the
; country and stayed at his residence on
! Myrtle street for the purpose of changing
: his camping suit for something more busi
nesslike. He hitched his horse and buggy
! before he went in, and when he returned
j both were gone. Such a bold daylight
i robbery astonished the police department.
â¢ This department is being reorganized, and
very properly every officer is anxious to
j make great records. The thieves could
; not have gone far, as Mr. Roeth advised
j the department within a few minutes of
missing his rig.
Chief Fletcher, Captain Wilson, Chief
: elect Hodgklns, all the detective force,
: half the patrol force, the Sheriff's office
: and the various Constables throughout
| the townships in Alameda and Contra
i Costa counties were at once advised of
- the crime. 'For several hours the search
was kept up, and at 3:20 a rig was dis
! covered at Sixteenth street station in
i which were five little urchinÃ, some of
them with unenviable records. To an of-
ficer they at once confessed they had
' stolen Mr. Roeth's rig and had driven it
' all around the racetrack, Blair Park and
Piedmont for five hours without even giv-
ing the animal time to drink.
When brought to the police station the
'â  five youngsters gave their names as Tony
Luder, Alma Luder, Luther Mitchell, Wal
ter Mitchell and John . O. Dunn:. Littl_
1 Luther, who is 7 years old, was the child
' who instigated the whole proceeding, even
I to unhitching the horse. At the City
' Prison the Aye young reprobates kept up
! a howling and wailing that could be heard
two blocks away. They declared that they
! had no idea of the heinousness of their
! offense. The police department seemed to
i be more chagrined at having the little
! fellows on their hands than pleased at the
I speedy result of the efforts to capture the
! stolen" property.

Talcott and Mitchell from their vacation.
The Supervisors laid the matter over at

Supervisor Wells went so far as to re
fer to the warden as "unworthy of his

Dave Bortree Says There Need Be No
Dave Bortree Says There Need Be No
Fear That the City Treasury
Cannot Hold the Vol
untary Gift. -
Oakland. Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, June 10.
Treasurer Gilpin is still exercising his
patience waiting for voluntary contribu
tions to the treasury. Up to date the fol
lowing is the record:
Councilman Barstow returned $20.
Councilman Cuvellier attempted to re-
turn $10.
'None of the other officials holding office
under the charter and whose salaries can-
not be reached by ordinance have yet
been affected by the economical fever.
At the same time, every unlucky individ-
I ual whose salary depends upon the cur
rent ideas of the Council has had his pay
cut 25 per cent, even down to those whose
salaries were but $50 a month.
Last April, when the new government
found a deficit facing it, everybody with
one accord agreed to help the situation.
A statement was circulated at the City
Hall, which was subscribed to by many
officials, setting forth their willingness to
return a quarter of their salary to the
treasury for the balance of the fiscal year.
As soon as possible after taking their
oaths of office the City Council met and
passed a very long ordinance by the terms
j of which the salaries of several hundred
employes of the city, including the whole
of the Street and Fire departments and
part of the Police Department, were lib-
erally cut. This ordinance met with the
unanimous approval of the Councilmen
and the Mayor, but up to date it has had
no effect except in the matter of Bar
stow's $20. â¢â 
It is true, of course, that there Is no
money in the treasury to pay any salaries
at this time, and this may be urged as a
reason why the statutory officials .have
not taken the dose of medicine they pre
scribed for those who, could not refrain
from taking it. This condition, however,
applied equally to all city employes those
who have been cut and those who cannot
be reached. Nearly' everybody, however,
has placed his demand on the treasury* in
one of the local banks, received his money
and inopportunely forgotten that the bur
den of helping the treasury was to have
been a common one and the honor of it
was not to be reserved for those who dare
not rebel. .â â .-'.'/;-â¢
"Mr. Barstow has brought us $20," said
Deputy Treasurer Dave Bortree, -.- "but
there is plenty of room in the treasury for
more, and no one need stay away on that
account." <--â .;.>' ' .
The Free Library trustees have passed
a resolution restoring the salaries of all
its employes to their original figures after
June 30. but no such meed of comfort has
been given to any other branch of the
city government. â¢ â¢ â¢ 'â¢â /:.-
THEIR 'MARRIAGE DOUBTFUL.
Gussie Olsen Tells a Story of Decep
tion on the Part of a Dis-
charged Soldier.
OAKLAND, June 10. â Andrew S.
Jacques, who claims to be a discharged
soldier, is being detained on a charge of
vagrancy at the City Prison, while the de
tectives are investigating a more serious
charge to which he may have to answer.
Gussie Olson, aged 17 years, tells a sad
story of deception. She states that
Jacques took her to San Francisco three
weeks ago and married her, but she does
not know who officiated or whether the
ceremony was legal. Now Jacques denies
the marriage, and to-day when the girl
and her aged mother called at the prison
he did hot care to see thenv.
"Miss Olsen knows that we were not
: married," said Jacques afterward, "and
: we only told that story to deceive her
j mother, who knew that we were living
â  together. I came here from Porto Rico,
and was honorably discharged with the
rank of first sergeant. I did not deceive
the girl, who was anxious to live with
me." â --. .--â  â '.â :â¢"'-"â¢'-:-,
The Olsens do not seem inclined to
prosecute Jacques, but Louis Brock has
sworn to a complaint charging the im
prisoned soldier with forging his name
to an order for room rent.
A COSTLY EGG HUNT.
George Burkhardt Jr. Breaks Both
Arms in a Fall.
ALAMEDA, June 10.â While hunting
birds' eggs yesterday morning near Mar- I
cuse, Sutter County, George Burkhardt,
a son of George Burkhardt of the Bank
of California, met with Injuries that may
permanently disable him. He had gone
to Marcuse to spend his vacation and was
taking advantage of the opportunity to
add some specimens to his collection of
birds' eggs. Burkhardt located a nest in
the limbs of a large cottonwood tree and
attempted yesterday morning to secure Its
contents. He had climbed the tree and
was near the end of a limb about twenty
feet from the ground, when the branch" l
gave way with his weight and fell with |
him to the earth. He broke both arms
between the elbow and wrist in the fall
and cut and severely bruised his face.
He was rendered . unconscious, and re
mained in that condition until found by j
some companions, who took him to |
Marysville for medical treatment. The
young man was brought to Alameda this
morning. He was suffering great pain
and his condition is considered serious.

To Meet the Deficit.
BERKELEY, June 10.â The finance com
mittee of the academic council has pre
pared the report to be submitted to the
Board of Regents at its meeting next
Tuesday on ways and means of meeting
the deficit in the university's budget for
the current year. The suggestion to cut
the salaries of the corps of instructors
was rejected, excerit that the president's
allowance was cut from $10,000 to $6000.
The most important part of the report
deals with an Increased tax on the "uni
versity's Immediate constituency," i. <â¢.,
a registration fee to be levied on the stu
dents.. The fee is fixed at 110 per term,
and Is expected to yield $24,200. The State
appropriation will yield $15,000 more than
the estimated income from that source,
and this together with the $24,200 from
students' fees will nearly cover the deficit.
A CHEEKY BURGLAR.
Steals Valuable Jewelry While the
Owner Is Within Hearing.
OAKLAND. June 10.â A daring burglar
made a rich haul at the residence of Mrs.
J. Andrade, 844 Madison street, shortly be
fore 9 o'clock to-night, securing several
gold watches, diamond rings and about
$100 worth of other jewelry.
Mrs. Andrade was calling on neighbors
at the time, and while her daughter was
entertaining a young man named Harry
Mason in the parlor, the burglar re
moved a screen from a rear window,
which he pried open and gained an en
trance. A slight noise attracted Miss An
rlrade's attention shortly afterward, and
she called to her mother, believing that
the latter had returned. Receiving no re
sponse, she went to her mother's bedroom
and found the door locked. Becoming
alarmed, she tried other doors and found
them locked. Hurrying back to the par
lor, she apprised her caller of her sus
picions. Mr. Mason then started on a tour
of investigation to the side of the house,
and just as he passed around the corner
of the building from the rear he saw a
man jump from Mrs. Andrade's bedroom
window. Divining the situation, . Mason
fired one shot at the fleeing burglar, and
he believes he hit him, though the in
truder made good his escape.
THE NATIONAL GUARD
IS TO BE INSPECTED
FIRST IMPORTANT ORDER SINCE
REORGANIZATION.
All the Companies in the Second
Brigade Will Be Visited on One
Day â A Trip to the Camp
Site.
With the exception of the First Regi
ment of Infantry, still in Manila, all the
regiments of the National Guard of this
State are in a position to respond to'a call
for duty, that is, with a few exceptions,
where some companies from many causes
have not yet reported for duty.
The guard is in such a condition that
an inspection has been called for,- as ap
pears* from the following general orders
No. 5, which were issued yesterday from
division headquarters: ;
I. Pursuant to orders from general
headquarters, the annual inspection
and muster of the National Guard is
hereby ordered to be held within the
time herein designated:
The First, Second and Third Brig-
ades, N. G. C, at such times prior to
July 1, 1899, as the respective brigade
commanders shall designate.
The naval militia at such time prior
to July 1, 1599, as shall be designated
by the division commander.
The Sanitary Corps, N. G. C, at such
time prior to July 1, 1899, as may be
designated by the brigade commander,
commanding the brigade to which they
are attached.
Provided that nothing in this para-
graph be construed as referring to
Troop C, First Brigade, N. G. C.
11. The inspection and muster will
be conducted under the personal su
pervision of the brldage inspector of
each brigade, or of such other officer
or officers as may be designated by the
respective brigade commanders. The
division commander will detail the
necessary officers to muster and in-
spect Troop C, First Brigade, and the
naval militia. â¢ ...V
111. Officers and men may be inspect-
ed during the evening, but all property j
must be Inspected during the day-
time, and must be exhibited to and ex- â¢
amined by each inspecting offlcer and
fully reported on by him. He will also
report fully as to what property is
useless or should be condemned. Mus
ter rolls must be prepared and handed
to the inspecting offlcer at the com-
mencement of each inspection.
. IV. Each inspector will properly
complete the muster rolls after inspec
tion and deliver the same to his im-
mediate commander, by whom they
will be transmitted and forwarded, so
that at* each superior headquarters
there will be one copy and also one
with each company and division in-
spected. ; */. ''â â '
V. Inspectors will require each com-
mand inspected to present its last an-
nual muster roll as complete by the in-
spection, and will note, in his report of
the inspection and muster hereby or-
dered, the changes that have occurred,
in detail.
VI. Officers and men will be mus
tered and inspected in service uni-
form, and inspectors will carefully ob-
serve divisions of paragraphs 56 to 9S,
rules and regulations, N. G. C. V:
VII. Inspecting officers are partic
ularly* instructed to make this muster
and 'inspection with the proper care
and attention to detail, for upon the
results of their work an intelligent
opinion can lie formed as to the condi
tion and effectiveness of the National
Guard, and of its component parts,
and information and suggestions are
thus obtained conducive to its im
provement.
This is the only effective way in
which the desired information can be

Laudatory Resolution Adopted Re-
garding Hale's Incumbency and
Aguirre Coached in His
Duties.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN QUENTIN PRISON, June 10.â
Warden W. E. Hale was present to
day at the last meeting of the Board of
State Prison Directors he will probably
ever attend in an official capacity. The
session was an important one for many
reasons and a full board was present, viz.:
President Fitzgerald and Directors Wil
kins, Hayes. Devlin and Ray. Martin
Aguirre, the new Warden, was on hand
in order to familiarize himself with the
routine of a monthly session. Mr. Aguirre
has spent the last few days at the prison
and is fast becoming acquainted with .ne
multifarious duties of so large an institu
tion, so that he will be far from an ama
teur when he takes up active duty on
July 1.
Jacob Oppenheimer, the convict who
slabbed Guard McDonald, was brought
before the board and the nature of the
charge against him. read by President
Fitzgerald. He pleaded guilty, but was
very sullen in his demeanor and insulting
in his, answers to the questions propound
ed by the various directors. When asked
why he did the deed he said:
"That is my business. If you can find it
out, all right." 'r*:^-V.*;''""!' ." ::-â  â¢â  -v. v â¢
In accordance with the rule adopted at
the last meeting held at Folsom, it was
decreed that Oppenheimer be placed in
solitary confinement for the remainder of
his life term. He sneered at the verdict
and walked away with an oath.
Warden Hale then handed in his last
report to the board. It reads in part as
follows:
To the Honorable the State Board of Prison
Directorsâ Gentlemen: I respectfully beg to re
port as follows regarding the bag and jute
business of the prison: Grain bags carried over
on orders from last year 535.000; sold and
booked since January 1, 5.472.700; total sold,
6 310 700. Shipped since January 1, 8,073, :
sold and waiting orders for shipment, 4,237,700;
on hand, manufactured and ready for ship
ment 3,773,500; to be manufactured to fill ac
cepted orders, 462,200.. Raw jute on hand, in
warehouses, 7773 bales, enough to run the mills.
not counting on shutdowns for repairs, until
April 15, 1900.
The cells- for incorrlglbles are about com
pleted, and will be ready for occupancy in a
tew days. This Improvement will prove a great
deterrent to the vicious and incorrigible class
from violating prison rules. These cells and
your order passed at the last meeting at Fol
som in regard to prisoners having knives or
other dangerous weapons in their possession
will greatly assist -the officers of the prison
In maintaining discipline and much less trouble
will occur. I congratulate my successor that
he assumes charge with these improvements
established.
Nearly all the afternoon was consumed
in receiving and' accepting bids for sup
plies for the prison for the succeeding
year The more important of these were
secured by the following:

Immediately before adjournment' the
board adopted a resolution it believed de
served by Warden Hale for the showing
made during his long incumbency. The
genera! trend of the resolution is shown
by the following extract:
William E. Hale has been Warden of the
State Prison at San Quentin for more than
eight years, and during all of that time has
had the fullest confidence of the Directors In
his itegrity, ability and devotion to duty. Under
his management the prison has been placed on
a substantial financial footing, expenses have
been materially decreased and all the business
affairs of the prison have been prudently and
economically conducted. He enjoys the enviable
record of losing but one prisoner by escape dur
ing his eight years of serviceâ testifying not
only to his watchfulness but also to the fidelity
of his subordinates. â¢'":â¢â â¢â¢â 
In his intercourse with the Board of Direc- |
tors he has always been frank, courteous and
business-like. He has had the respect of all ,
who" have had dealings with the prison, and the
manifold and diverse duties of Warden as man
ager of an extensive manufactory, as disci],!,
arian directing his appointees, and as a prison I
officer governing those intrusted to. his charge,
he has ever performed with kindness and firm- !
ness, with skill and integrity.

SAN JOSE SEEKERS
OF OFFICE ACTIVE
Major Martin to Make Numerous
Appointments on the First
of July.
SAN JOSE, June 10.â Between now and
July 1 local politicians will be the busiest
men in the Garden City, advancing the
interests of their favorites for the sev
eral vacancies that shall occur in the dif
ferent city commissions. At that time two
terms expire in the Board of Education
and one each in the Police Commission,
Park Commission and the Library Trus
tees. All these are to be filled by Mayor
Martin. Daily his office is thronged by
candidates and their "political influences,
but these are likely to be disappointed.
The Mayor, who Is a conservative and
non-committal man. receives all with a
gracious smile, but says nothing. This
is puzzling to the workers, for Mayor
Martin has already demonstrated that no
one knows his selections until the ap
pointments have been made. .'.-._.
In the Police Commissk* Ernest Lion,
who was appointed about ten days ago
to fill the vacancy caused by the resigna
tion of T. F. Morrison, will surely be re
appointed. In the School Board the terms
of Robert J. Langford (now Sheriff) and
Charles __Â» Kenyon expire. Theodore Len
zen drew the short term in the Library
Trustees and A. C. Darby in- the Park
Commission. Kenyon will undoubtedly be
reappointed School Trustee, but a suc
cessor to Langford will be named. Who
will succeed him is not known. Friends
of Darby and Lenzen assert these two will
be retained in the Park Commission and
Library Trustees respectively. .
WATSONVILLE VOTES
FOR SEWER BONDS
Overwhelming Majority of Ballots
Cast in Favor of the Propo
sition.
WATSONVILLE, June 10.â A big step
in the line of progress was made to-day
in Watsonville when her citizens by an
overwhelming vote decided in favor of
the Issuance of $40,000 worth of bonds for
a sewer system. ... .
The agitation was started by the City
Council last fall, when it employed En
gineer McCray to make an estimate on
the cost of a water and sewer system.
After he had clone so the local water
company became alarmed and 'offered to
thereafter furnish the city free of charge
water for street sprinkling, hydrants,
park and all other municipal purposes,
which formerly had cost over $100 a
month. . As the rates to local consumers
were very reasonable the Council ac
cepted the proposition and eliminated the
water works proposition.
Five hundred and seventeen votes were
cast to-day for the bonds and ninety
three against them.
Fire at Windsor.

GOVERNOR GAGE may not In-
tend to applaud all grades and
degrees of embezzlement of pub-
lie money in his appointment of
â¢ men to serve under his adminis
tration, but lie seems to be going down
the line of defaulters and picking out
rare specimens. To keep Burns and
Rickard company the Governor has
appointed as Supervisor to fill a va
cancy in Calaveras County Charles M.
Burleson. The records show that Bur
leson, who was postmaster at Moke

ment in 1895. Regarding the arrest The
Call of July 24, 1895, published the fol
lowing Information:
Chales M. Burleson, the ex-postmas
ter of Mokelumne Hill, was before
United States Commissioner Heacock
yesterday on a charge of embezzling
$1100 17 of the Government's money
while in office. He was held to answer
before the United States Grand Jury
and gave bonds m the sum of $3500.
Burleson while postmaster got his ac-
counts into a tangle, and when an ex-
amination of his stamps and cash on
hand was made by Postoffice Inspect-
or Erwln the above shortage was dis-
covered.

Some Interesting facts regarding the
embezzlement were not brought to pub- I

the records of the Postoffice Depart
ment at Washington, D. C, have been
recently examined and they are now
. produced:
When the discovery was made that
Burleson's accounts were crooked Post- ,
office Inspector Robinson was sent to
Mokelumne Hill to demand the pay- j
ment of the money due the Government.
Burleson, when first Interviewed, prom- j
ised to make good the shortage within '
two hours, but the promise was not
kept. Promises were subsequently made
and violated. The amount of the short
age was not paid until Burleson was re.
moved from office, arrested for embez
zlement and brought to this city. After
the money was paid the United States
District Attorney placed the matt be
fore the Grand Jury, but the latter
body, in view erf the fact that Burleson '
had made restitution of the stolen j
money, did not indict him.
The story comes from Calaveras
County that Gage appointed C. M. Bur- i
leson i' fill a vacancy in the County
Board of Supervisors on the recom
mendation mainly of Varney Gaskill,
secretary of the Paris Exposition Com
mission. it is asserted that the Repub
lican organization of the county, back
by Senator John It. Davis, Assembly
man H. S. Blood and Alex Brown of the
State Board of Equalization, indorsed
another man. The vacancy was caused
by the death of Supervisor John R.
Smith, an I the man recommended for
appointment by Senator Davis and j
other leading Republicans is the son
of the deceased Supervisor.
The appointment of C. ai. Burleson
was made by Governor Gage on April
IT. Burleson qualified on April 20.

sip when the fight was hottest that the
Governor sent for Davis and asked the
Senator to abandon the fight. The

the wrath of Gage. The man recom-

HOW GAGE MADE
GENERAL OTIS SICK
STORY OF SEAMANS' APPOINT-
MENT.
Mystery of the Governor's Most Re-
markable Selection for the Head
of the National Guard Is
Now Solve-..
The Grand Army Veterans and National
Guardsmen are yet wondering why Gov
ernor Gage appointed Captain W. H.
He.-, mans to be adjutant general. They
cannot imagine the reasons which induced
the Governor to make this rather remark
able lection. It Is true that Captain
Beamai a Is tall and handsome. On parade
he presents a fine figure. The Governor
himself is a beauty, but not quite as
beautiful in repose as the new adjutant
general. Still, the suggestion that the
chief of staff should match the comman
der-in-chief In point of personal comeli
ness Is not accepted as a clear explanation
of tho selection.
A story comes to The Call which may
clear away the entire mystery. When
Gage appointed his friend and Dan Burns'
friend. Walter Parker of Los Angeles to
be expert for the State Board of Examin
ers General Harrison Gray Otis, com
manding the Los Angeles Times, was In
dignant and gave vent to his indignation
In his paper. The newspaper Insinuated
that the appointment was discreditable.
When the Governor. road the Times' com
ment on Parker's case it came to his mind
âor rather, his headâ that there was one
man in California for whom General Otis
entertained the most supreme contempt,
and that one was W. 11. Seamans. In
stantly perceiving an opportunity to cud
gel Otis, the Governor turned to one of
his secretaries with the remark: "I will
announce an appointment that will make
Otis sick. Fill out a commission- for W.
H. Seamans for adjutant general."
The foregoing is, no doubt, the true
story of Seamans' selection to fill, the
position of adjutant general. Word comes
from the south that the appointment did
make Otis sick, but the sickness caused
by the selection is not confined to any
particular class or section. It is spread
ing throughout the State. Otis' case is
only one of one hundred thousand.

Henry X. Clement has been selected to
represent the Board of Election Commis
sioners and Registrar Steppacher in the
suit instituted a few days ago by Attor
ney Ruef on behalf -of Superintendent of
Streets Fragley and others in the matter
of the validity of the new charter and the
municipal and primary elections soon to
be held. This was decided yesterday at' a
meeting of the Election Commissioners.
it was also agreed that City and County
Attorney Bane, who Is a member of tlio
' commission, shall act with Attorney Cle
! ment in all matters pertaining to the suit.
Attorney Collins, who represents the
county officers who are seeking to retain
their places In spite of the new chart*
and who have tiled a suit against the
Registrar and the members of the Board
of Election Commissioners, appeared be-
ire the commission with a tormal de
mand that in the call for a primary elec
tion the nanus of county offices be ex
cluded from the list of offices to be filled
at the" municipal election to be held In
November, lie asked that the commit--:
Blon deny tile' demand in order thai lie
might apply to the courts for a writ of
mandate. The Supreme Court, he said,
ii. bearing such a writ would necessarily
be compelled to go Into the merits of the
controversy and a speedy and lasting de-
termination of tin- merits of the conten
tion of the county officers would thus be
brought about.
Commissioner ' Lane ' favored such a
course for the reason that ii would bring
the matter to a speedy issue and thus pre-
vent embarrassment and delay. He said
that it such a step were not taken Attor
ney Collins would be forced to resort to
injunction proceedings at some later day.
Inasmuch as the county officers are de-
termined to test their right to retain their
offices ii would be better, he thought, to
have the question of their right to do so
settled by the courts as speedily as pos
sible.
Mayor Phelan was not in favor of facili
tating the matter in any manner. lie said
that he believed the proper course to pur
sue would be for the commission to ignore
the demand and thus force the officials to
resort to such other remedy as the courts
see fit to afford them. This view of the
case was not supported by the other Com
missioners, but at the suggestion of Com
missioner Lane final action was postponed
for one week in order to allow- of certain
changes in the formal demand made by
the officials through their attorney.
As originally presented the demand in
cludes the names of Assessor Dodge and
Coroner Hill. ' Both these officials deny
that they desire to become parties to the
suit on the ground that they do not wish
to oppose In any way the provisions of the
new charter. Their names will be stricken
from the list and at the next meeting- of
the commission a resolution will be adopt
ed formally refusing to comply with the
demand to exclude county offices from the
call for a primary election. Attorney Col
lins will then apply to the Supreme Court
for an original writ of mandate, and upon
the hearing of this writ will depend the
final determination of the contention of
the county officials.
HIS WORK
APPROVED
The Master of Excelsior
Lodge Receives a
Badge.
The Badge Presented to A. K.
Kingsford.
Excelsior Degree No. 2, Independent
Order of Odd Fellows, met last night to
confer degrees on candidates, and the at-
tendance was so large that the hall In
which the meeting is usually held was too
small, so by courtesy of Templar Rebekah
Lodge there was an exchange of halls,
and Memorial hall in the Odd Fellows'
building was crowded to its limit. The
work of that team was not the only fea
ture that attracted. Another feature was
the presentation by S. <;. 'Whitney of Occi
dental Lodge, on behalf of the Odd Fel-
lows of San Francisco, to A. K. Kingsford,
for six years connected with the degree
lodge and for four consecutive years its
i master, of one of the most magnificent
badges ever presented to an Odd Fellow
in this city. It was a token of apprecia
tion of the zeal of Mr. Kingsford for the
order and for the energy he displayed dur
ing his long connection with the degree
lodge to continue it in the standard of
efficiency to which he brought it.
The gold badge, which cost $250, has at
the top the all-seeing eye; under it is a'
view of the Golden Gate with a blazing
sun just reaching the horizon; above this
is a valuable diamond, while under it are
the three links, representing Friendship,
Love and Truth, the first being a link of
diamonds* the second of sapphires and the
third of rubies. In the center of the
badge Is the picture of King Solomon In
enamel of different colors, while under
neath Is the motto of the order and the
year 1899. The inscription on the reverse
is: "A. K. Kingsford, Degree Master of
Excelsior Degree Lodge No. 2, from the
Odd Fellows of San Francisco, June 10."
The language of the presentation was
eloquent, and the response was a model of
modesty. The pleasant event was followed
by addresses suitable to the occasion by
Thomas Case, W. A. S. Nicholson, Grand
Secretary George T. Shaw. Past Grand
Master J. H. Simpson and vocal selections
by the Knickerbocker Quartet.
RAILROAD CRAFT IN
THE GRAIN SCHEDULE
Farmers Receive No Benefits From
a Bogus Reduction.
The New Freight Rates Do Not Affect Centers of Traffic
and Are Established for Routes Over Which
Grain Is Not Shipped.
THE true effect of the new grain
rate schedule, as adopted by the
Railroad Commission, is rapidly
becoming known and will soon
be seriously felt by farmers and
shippers. Under a sham and pretense
of forcing the Southern Pacific Com
pany to accept an average reduction of
10 per cent in grain freight rates the
Railroad Commissioners have actually
increased and not diminished the rates
at important points and in grain cen
ters. J. C. Stubbs and his corps of
railroad workers have cunningly and
craftily arranged a new schedule which
i seems to be a reduction and is really
an Increase.
The work has been well done in the
Interest of the railroad. Railroad Com
missioners Laumelster and Blackstock
were, of course, in the secret of the
scheme. The Southern Pacific authori-
ties simply prepared the schedule and
ordered these two worthies to adopt it.
Unfortunately Commissioner Edson
was trapped into acquiescence by a
plausible misrepresentation of the facts
and was induced to vote for the sched
: ule. His vote made no particular dif
; ference, as the majority intended to
obey the railroad at all hazards, and
: their votes would have carried the
1 schedule into effect. So another gross
outrage has been committed and an
i other grave injury has been inflicted
i upon the farmers of the State.
When it became known that Stubbs
I was preparing the schedule and would
present it to the commission through
; the railroad puppet Laumelster," the
: most stupid observer could not fail to
I understand that the Southern ' Pacific
j Company intended to win its important
i fight. The fight has been won beyond
the railroad's wildest expectations of
j success. An analysis of the schedule
! shows that farmers and shipper?, will
j now have to pay higher freight rates
! than before. In the great grain cen
ters where the traffic is heavy and
i profitable, the rates have been left to
stand as they were or have been ac
' tually increased. In Southern Califor
! nia and the San Joaquin Valley no
: changes have been made. In the Upper
Sacramento, Napa, Santa Clara and
j San Ramon valleys rates have appar
; ently been reduced and in fact have
j been increased.
This cunning advantage has been
taken by the Southern Pacific Company
over the farmers by decreasing the
rates where there is little or practically
no traffic, and consequently no bene
fit to the shippers. â¢ Where farmers
have to use the railroad in legitimate
channels of trade the freight rates re
main the same or have been actually
increased. The Santa Clara Valley is
one of the most pronounced sufferers
by the change. The reductions in near
ly every case possess no more than fic
titious values to the farmers and ship
pers of the State.
But the Southern Pacific Company
was too shrewd to drag the serviceable
j Commissioners again through the mire
of their own dishonor, so another
â  scheme was suggested. This was to
make an ostensible reduction of 10 per
cent. If a general average of the re
ductions made is struck it . will be
shown that the decrease in charges
is actually 10 per cent, but that is the
"joker" in the Southern Pacific Com
pany's crooked deal.
Hates which have absolutely no ma-
terial effect upon the grain traffic of
the State have been greatly reduced, in
some instances the reduction being as

| great as SO per cent. But this means
nothing to the farmer, as there is prac
tically no traffic at the points thus fav
ored by the Southern Pacific Company.
The tricksters in C. P. Huntington's
service have been enabled, however, to
make a good front and lose nothing by
the deception. An apparent averaged
10 per cent reduction has been made,
the La Rue schedule has been abolish
ed and the farmers are left without
even the redress of the courts to be
come the prey of the railroad. The
haste with which the new schedule
was adopted indicates also the fear of
the Southern Pacific Company that
legally it would be at-- a serious disad
vantage before Judge Morrow in the
final settlement of the suit instituted
to enjoin the Railroad Commission
from carrying out the La Rue schedule.
The railroad is fighting payment of
the costs of that suit after it had been
dismissed at the request of the South
j crn Pacific Company. In determining
; the liability for costs Judge Morrow
would determine as well the validity
! of the La Rue schedule which, through
some strange oversight on the part of
! Herrin, had not beeen abolished when
I the La Rue resolution was rescinded.
! The Southern Pacific Company thus
found itself in a strange predicament
and hastened the preparation, presen
tation and adoption of the Laumels-
ter schedule.
The adoption of this schedule de
stroys the La Rue schedule and it will
be claimed leaves nothing for Judge
Morrow to determine. Through this
small hole the Southern Pacific Com
pany hopes to escape payment of the
costs of suit; and at the same time the
new schedule inflicts new burdens up
on the farmers. These facts add a new
demonstration that out of the railroad
building there can emanate nothing
honest.

Hair Crimping With a Loss.
The daughter of H. A. Gottung, resid
ing at 3010 Castro street, while preparing
for her afternoon's promenade yesterday
started in to crimp her hair. To do this in
the most approved fashion she lighted a
coal oil lamp and placed her little crimp
ing iron over the Same. While the iron
was getting hot she stepped out to have
a chat with a friend, but her stay was
brief, as the smoke and flames from a
burning room called her back. The result
was that an alarm was turned in from
box 571, which brought the department to
the place. The lire was quickly subdued,
not, however, until $200 worth of damage
was done to the property of the young
lady's father.

INTO SLAVERY
VANCOUVER. June s.â An atro
cious case of the selling of two
Chinese girls as slaves has just
startled the people of British
Columbia, Two little girls of
tender years were Bold by their father
with no more consideration than if they
had been hogs' carcasses. Packed in
narrow boxes, they were delivered like
livestock to their destinations.
The whole story is the most brutal of
-ts nd that ever occurred on the Pa
cific Coast. The fact that white men
are Implicated places a crime of horri
ble cruelty in a worse light.
The fact that for years Chinese wo
men have been sold as slaves is well
known, but the difficulty has always
been In fixing the crime. The two girls
whose pictures are given en the
pride of a mining camp where women
were few. When they disappeared un
der mysterious circumstances, within
a few weeks of one another, every
miner in Quesnelle camp was indignant
and every one took an interest in fer
reting the mystery to the bottom.
Discovery of the Sale.
Shortly afterward the whole details
came out, and now the authorities are
INVENTOR HOE TELLS HOW HE BUILT HIS FIRST BIG PRINTING PRESS.
Special to the Sunday Call.
WERE It not for the high speed perfecting press this newspaper
could not be printed and plated before you in Its present form;
certainly not at its present cost. The modern newspaper, with
Its wonderful service in spreading information and molding
pinion', is perhaps the greatest civilizing and controlling force
of its time. The rapid printing press, by. making the news-
paper possible, deserves to rank as one of the great achievements in an age
of mechanical Invention. Certainly there is no other machine of such
power and complexity that possesses at the same time such accuracy and
delicacy, handling printing and folding sheets of paper that can be torn
between the fingers without an effort.
Consider for a moment the work done by one of the great presses
known to printers as tuple" machines. To begin with, it. is composed
of about Hi.ooo separate pieces, and requires eighteen months for its cou-
struction In the largest manufactory In the country, it is more complicated
than a locomotive or .1 watch, or any of the forms of mechanism to which
we ordinarily refer as remarkable lor their intricacy or nicety.
This press is' fed from three continuous rolls of paper, each more than
five fe"t wide, and all reeling off the paper as fast as It will run without
tearing At. it.-' highest speed the press will use up over two miles of this
paper In an hour, or fifty miles of paper of the width of an ordinary news-
paper page.
In terms more readily grasped, this Indicates a capacity of Sft.OOO four,
In terms more readily grasped, this Indicates a capacity of 96.000 four,
six or eight page papers per hour. Not only are these papers printed at
th's astounding rate but they are rtiso cut, folded and counted. In other
words the press performs ever? operation connected with the paper from
the time Hi" rolls an put into position until the finished product emerge--
ready to be put on sale. Ninety thousand papers pur hour means 1509 per .
minuted or _;, copies for every second ticked "if on your watch.
Most of the larger newspapers have In their ordinary issues ten or
twelve pages. Of these the press will turn out 72 .'(00 in an hour, 1200 to the'
minute, or 20 every second.
The machine weighs over sixty tons and Is massive in its proportions.
Vet Its touch Is as deft â â â - that of human fingers. It handles the papers
accurately, cuts them precisely and folds them up evenly, all with speed
that Is well nigh incredible
Its operation is easy and resistless. A man throws back a lever: the
many shafts and riders begin to revolve, going faster and faster until
the streams of white paper are pouring Into the machine too rapidly for the .
eve to measure. On the other side the printed sheets rain out so fast thai
one sees only the continual flash of the steel fingers that seize and forward
ever*4* sheet. â¢.--â e-v. *.
The operation of the press at Its highest rate of speed means that each
The operation of thi Its highest rate of speed means that each
paper receives its impression in less than one-fifth of a second. How a
permanent Imprint can be made In that space of time is a marvel difficult
to comprehend. Yet it Is done. The ink docs not 'smut nor rub. off, and
even the most delicate lines of an Illustration are accurately reproduced.
V Genesis of the Invention.
It is easy to understand that such a machine as this, performing so
many different operations, represent a series of achievements rather thin
a single one. It Is a gradual and natural development from the wooden
screw press used by Guttenberg hack In the middle of the fifteenth century.
But while there is no bard and fast line separating the new from the
old or the perfect from the primitive in the history of printing, there are
certain dates that are marked by notable advances and -improvements in
the art. .-'â¢â â -â¢ ...
One important change took place in 1806. when a Saxon named *""red-
Tick Koenig devised a form of press In which the paper was carried on a
THE Sunday CALL
Edition
investigating the matter with a view
to punishing the brutes Implicated.
An old Chinaman, whose family name
was Quong, was the inhuman father of
the two girls, and It was he who
profited by their sale into slavery.
Twenty years ago Quong was among
the first of the Chinese gold-hunters
who went to the rich Cariboo fields, and
there he has lived ever since. For
three or four years he was a prosperous
miner among his countrymen. During
that time he managed to save enough
money from his gold digging operations
to bring out his wife from China. But
before this, he had taken another wo
man In with him on a sort of common
law partnership.
Before wife No. 1 arrived from China
Quong married this second woman un
der the Canadian law. Hers were the
children whom the brutal father sold
irfto slavery.
When Quong's first wife arrived
from her home in China Quong evi
dently .tight that with the two
women bt could not be expected to
demean nimself with work any longer.
So for over ten years Quong has retired
from active personal labor. He forced
the two women to wash gold in his
placer claim during the day, and what
few hours they could steal from the
night he compelled them to wash the
miners' clothes. Between them they
did the laundry work for the camp
and Quong pocketed the pay.
Nailed Her Up in a Box.
During these years Quong has ap
parently taken a good deal of Interest
in his two little girls. Every miner in
the camp knew the children. Much as
they hated the father, they often gave
candies and small presents to the
youngsters, who had a pretty free run
of the mining claims in the vicinity.
Pele, the younger girl, was 13 years
Pele. the younger girl, was 13 years
old at the first of the year, and her sis-
ter is only about two years older, al-
though she looks nearer 20.
Three months ago Quong, the father,
sold the elder girl to another Chinaman
at Soda Creek, about 100 miles from her
home in Quesnelle. He got $250 cash
for her.

hand and lever forms, because the cylinder had to stop three timesâ that
is. had three separate motionsâ each impression. But in 1814 Koenig
improved on this by a continuously revolving cylinder press which at
tained the rate of 800 sheets per hour. The advance from 200 sheets per
hour, the record of the old hand presses, to 800 sheets, was a decided
advance. Moreover, it introduced a new principle which has been of the
first Importance In developing the modern high-speed press.
Many improvements in the method of handling the paper were devised
after Koenig's press came into use, and thousands of presses constructed
upon this plan are in use to-day. An American improvement on this style
of press, known as the double cylinder, attained a speed of 4000 per hour.
These presses answered the requirements of the newspapers when they
were small in size and circulation. But with the advent of the daily, with
its circulation running up to many thousands, they proved Inadequate,
There was a demand for something better, for greater speed.
First Rapid Printing Press.
In 1845 tne firm of It. Hoe & Co., which ".had already been for many
years engaged In the manufacture of printing presses, attacked this prob
lem. A number of cxprimental machines were erected, and finally it <>c
currd to the experimenters that by placing the type Instead of the paper
on tne cylinder greater speed could be obtained. The result was the con
struction of a press known as the "Hoi' Type Revolving Machine," em
bodying patents, taken out by Richard M. Hoe. The first one of these
machines was placed In the Ledger office In Philadelphia in 1846. The
basis of these Inventions consisted in an apparatus for securely fastening
tie forms of type on a central cylinder placed in a horizontal position
This was accomplished by the construction of cast iron beds, one for each
age of the newspaper. The column rules wrere made "V" shaped, i. c.,
tapering tow Mil tin- feet of the type. It was found that with proper ar
rangement for locking up or securing th" type upon these beds it could
be held firmly in position, the surface forming a true circle, and the cylin
der revolved any speed required without danger of the type falling out.
The first of these presses had only four impression cylinders, neces
sitating four boys to feed In the sheets. The running speed obtained was
about 2000 sheets to each feeder per hour, thus giving, with what ,was
called a "four-feeder," or "four-cylinder" machine, a running capacity
of about 8000 papers per hour printed upon one side. As the demands of
the newspapers, increased more Impression cylinders -.were added, until
these machines were made with as many as ten grouped around the cen
tral cylinder, giving an aggregate speed of about 20.000 papers per hour
printed upon one side. A revolution in- newspaper printing took- place.
Journals which before bad been limited in their circulation by their in-
ability to furnish the papers rapidly increased their issue, and many now
ones were started. The new presses were' adopted not only throughout the
United States but also in Great Britain. '
Th" type-revolving machine marked a great advance In rapid printing.
it was believed that the problem had been settled, at least for a long time
to come.. It was scarcely conceivable that any paper would want to print
more than 20.000 copies tier hour. ;i'-7v\T â 'â¢â "'- â â !""-.-â /

Various experiments had demonstrated the possibility of casting stete-
otype plates on a curve. The process was brought to perfection by the
use of flexible paper matrices upon which the metal was. cast In curved
molds to any circle desired. These plates were placed upon the type-re-
volving machines Instead of the type forms. The newspaper publishers
were thus enabled to duplicate the forms and to run several machines at
for the Chinese connoisseur who in
spected them, and. in their own phrase
ology, she had simply not been bred for
sale. More attention was paid to the
physical refinement of the younger girl.
It was in the coldest part of winter
that the girl was sold into slavery.
The two white men who hauled and
delivered her like so much goods were,
of course, fearful of detection, and in
order to insure safe delivery they as
sumed a C. O. D. sort of air and nailed
the girl up in a box, just large enough
to contain her. Holes were bored
through the top to admit air. The
prisoner was helpless and could only
live in pain and anxiety until delivered
to the destination marked on the box.
Pleaded for Her Liberty.
The mother of the girl pleaded pite
ously for the freedom of the daughter.
the same time, with a view to turning out the papers with greater rapid
ity. In some of the large-London and New York offices as many as live
of these machines were kept in constant operation. â 'â â â  . â  â¢
The difficulty in obtaining high speeds with these machines was not in
printing fast enough, but in getting the sheets to the machine rapidly and
in disposing of them quickly titter they had passed through the press.
The demand was for a press which would print, from. a continuous roll
of paper, leaving tie sheets to be cut and folded after, they had passed
through the machine. It was necessary, too, to insure satisfactory re-
sults, that the machine should perform all these operations itself. It was
found that human hands could not work fast enough to keep up with tho
requirements of the modern newspaper.
In 1871 11. Hoe & Co. set to work to study this problem in a compre
hensive manner and to solve, the difficulties in the way of attaining much
.higher speed than had ever before been attempted.
Expert mechanicians were set to work on different phases of the prob
lem. Time, money and effort were expended without stint in the study of
existing. models. In erecting experimental machines, and In trying all man-
ncr of devices suggested to meet the requirements of the situation.
The difficulties were not wholly of a mechanical nature. . One was in
the set-off of the first side of the sheet printed. This was avoided by, the
co-operation of the inkmakers, who were Induced to devise special rapid-
drying inks. - --. C, â *
Another drawback was in obtaining paper in the roll of uniform per
fection and strength. The paper makers were led to make a study of pro
ducing large rolls of paper meeting. these requirements. ' They solved the
problem of finding a strong and cheap paper such as could 'be afforded by
the daily press. i:-;* :-;
While these Improvements were being wrought out the' press manu
facturers were working on the problem of a rapid severance of the sheets
after printing and the reliable and accurate delivery of the. printed papers.
The most Important; device relating to this matter was the patent of
Stephen D. Tucker, a member of the firm of -It. Hoe & Co. It was called
a. "gathering and delivering cylinder," and was able to .-.handle the papers
as fast as they were printed. It is the mechanism -on- which' the gnat
speed of the modern press depends. Without it one of the great machines
would block a press room with papers before it had been in operation fif
teen minutes. â¢; - â ;;'.<'-.:;'.; - -'â¢;"â -> j â *">:.: .:',, â¢"'. " 'â  ''
Thus it will be seen the rapid-working web press, is a composite for
which no one man deserves the entire credit. It is one of the most notable
examples of a really wonderful mechanism constructed jlnf response to a
specific demand. The expert mechanicians engaged in the manufacture of
presses knew what was wanted. They sat down and figured to these re
sults just as experts in other fields might solve problems in mathematics
or military tactics \ It is a concrete Illustration of the saying that no mat
ter what the demand is. If it is strong enough-it-will be satisfied.
The press which was constructed in 1871' as a result of these investiga
tions was fed from a roll or web of paper over cylinders carrying stereo
typed plates which printed it on both sides. â  -" ;_ " â¢
The sheets were not entirely severed by the cutters; but were simply
perforated after the printing. They were drawn by accelerating tapes, which
completely separated them. into a gathering cylinder so constructed that
six. or- any. desired .number, of perfect papers could be gathered one over
the other. These, by means of . a switch, were, at the proper moment,
turned off on to sheet flyers, which deposited them on the receiving board'
This press for the first. time did away completely with hand labor in
the process of printing. It was. therefore, the beginning .of rapid printing

perform in connection- with it were the startingl of the press. .watching to

The weather was still very cold when

They laughed brutally and said that
they had been paid $135 for doing their

delivered the box they 'did â¢ not care

Mrs. Langdale was alone. Neither

When the first of these web perfecting presses was put into successful
operation it was claimed that there was no limit to its speed except the
ability of the paper to .stand the strain, of passing through the press This
claim seemed to be justified by the fact that 18,000 an hour were printed
from a single feedboard. This was. however, the maximum speed obtained

about the only good thing to know about
the remarkable episode. She is not old

usual kind. She is familiar with the wild
and rough life of the half-world in that
new land of sun and freedom.
A few years ago she was called a hand

a disorderly resort In Phocnftc, the Terri
torial capital, where the sporting and
frontier elements still make the city about
the wildest and most brilliant scene of
frontier life in the West. '
Then she knocked around the Territory
riding in stages, making trips astride of a
mule, camping on desert trails now and
then and knowing the cactus and the
Gila monster, the miner, the packer and
tho stage driver and the thirst of desert
days and the thill of desert nights. She
lived at Globe for some timeâ that lively
mining camp and center of the Globe
mining district in Gila County, far to the
northeast of Phoenix.
It was there that she fell in with the
stranger with whom she went forth to
rob. Of who he was or where he came
from she only knew what tie told her. A
common attachment bound them and they
lived and planned together. Finally they
disappeared from Globe
I.ate in the afternoon of May 31 some
thing exciting happened on the dusty des
ert highway from Florence to Globeâ the
two towns over a hundred miles apart. It
was in the canyon .of -he Gila River, near
Riverside, a little half-way station on the
stage road over which all travel between
the places pass.
The driver heard the old command,
"Halt!" and saw the old vision of the big
mouths of gun barrels. Then the passen
gers saw the living picture and were
squeamish. They saw two men without
masks in control of the situation.
One had a shotgun leveled at the stage
and a, leveled shotgun is to be obeyed.
The other man made a warning display
with a big revolver. There were only
three passengers, and they got out and
lined up with the driver, while the reek
ing horses rested, and the shotgun pointed
and the bigger of the two men went
through the pockets of the quartet his
bold partner guarded well.
The robbers got a six-shooter, a gold
watch and about $350 in money!

shorter bandit who si nod boldly and firm

This robber wore an ordinary suit of
rough but fairly neat though dusty
clothes, Including a broad-brimmed hat.
At a little distance he might have been
taken, for a prosperous prospector. But
O'Neill noticed that the lingers on the
barrel and trigger were long and white
and slender and not in harmony with the
rough . attire. Then he noticed a regu

striking udder the circumstances, and
then he noted that the dark hair was

those little affairs are over with. The
bandits disappeared. When the telegraph

of many long Arizona chases after crimi
nals was quickly on.
It was -three days before the Sheriff of
Pima County and his posse struck the
trail. The robbers had started on foot
southeast to either gain tin- railroad or
Mexico, and the trail was followed.
The bandits pressed on over lonely and
somewhat . circuitous roads and trails,
traveling at night much of the time, get
ling as they could something to cat and
drink and some to pack along and sleep
ing part of the day in the sheltered nooks
in canyons.
Sheriff Truman and his bandit hunters
may probably thank their afternoon sleep
of June 4 that there were no dead or
wounded to pack to the nearest railroad
station. Pearl and her bandit lover,
wearied and sore, had gone to sleep in
the afternoon in a shade in a gulch near
Benson, a town on the Southern Pacific
Railroad in the southeastern part of' the
Territory not far from the Mexican line
and a hundred miles from the scene of the
robbery. They had pressed on until close
to better prospects of escape.
The Sheriff and his posse luckily trailed
and discovered them and planned to se
cure their game before waking them.
The robbers awoke just as the guns were
secured and found themselves looking into
pistol barrels.

BIGGEST CHECKS EVER DRAWN.
What's the largest amount you can
write a check for and then cash It? There
are any number of persons in New York
who . sign their names .to checks every
day which are big enough to make the
average mortal gasp with astonishment.
When Uncle Sam handed over to Spain
four orders or checks on New York's Sub-
Treasury for $20,000,000 most people's eyes
bulged out at so much cash being repre
sented by such small bits of paper. The
man who cashed them, however, never
so much as winked his eye as he beheld
them. He is used to such transactions,
as it is a common thing for Uncle Sam to
make drafts away up in the millions.

his name to a few big checks himself,
some of them representing nearly twenty

B. G. Mitchell, treasurer of the Central

checks as any one in the city. Most of
the big downtown banks keep one man
busy signing checks all day. One light

HOW HELEN JACKSON, KNOWN AS JACK
HALL, WAS DISCOVERED AFTER
LEADING A COWBOY'S LIFE FOR
SEVERAL YEARS.
"Captain Dick Wells and Mrs.
Wells, formerly Jack Hall, will
leave next week for San Fran
cisco en route for Portland, Or."
THIS is the Item that heads the
personal column of most of this
week's Arizona papers.
Back of this is a story that has
set all Arizona agog. The tale of a
woman masquerading in cowboy
attire, lassoing cattle, taking part "In
shooting scrapes, loading the wild, free,
adventurous life of the Arizona vaquero.
The story of a woman who. because her
father had been hanged as a horsi thief.
changed her name, hid her sex and in the
beating of hoof and the whizzing of bullet
sought to drows the memory of the dis
grace. 'As a fitting finale, when her sex
was discovered, she married "Captain
Dick," the bravest and boldest cowboy
in all Arizona.
It is a story linked with strange and
dramatic incidents that could happen no
where save in Arizona, where fact still
puts fiction to blush and boot and spur
have not altogether given way to patent
leathers. . ,
It was just about a year ago that a
slender, clean-shaven youth asked for
work at one of the big cattle ranches near
Williams. Captain Dick, who was the
leader of the cowboys, engaged the "ten
derfoot," and "Jack Hall," the name the
applicant for work gave, won his spurs
in the annual rodeo for which the cow
boys were then preparing.
By day Jack sat his horse rounding up
the cattle and at night slept on the
ground. He was quiet and distant toward
-.he other cowboys, but for the most part
they liked him. Before the first month
had passed he had an opportunity to show
bis mettle.
A number of cowboys were spending the
night in a typical ' Arizona townâ
saloon per every fifteen inhabitants. Jack
Hall, in search of Captain Dick, dropped
into one of the saloons. A cowboy, re-
volver in hand, was acting as master of
ceremonies, while in the middle of the
floor the barkeeper, half dead from fa-
tigue, was doing a dance, to the amuse-
ment of the rest of the cowboys.
When the barkeeper attempted to stop
twirling his feet the cowboy shouted for
more dancing- and the master of cere-
monies encouraged the barkeeper by pop-
ping .his pistol bullets dangerously near
his feet.
Jack Hall watched the scene In silence
until he saw that the barkeeper had
ached the limit of his endurance. Then
he deftly wrenched the pistol from the
cowboy's hand and, turning It on him.

a check for $344,000 in payment.
One, of the smallest checks ever Issued

to that amount. Mr. Cleveland did not

.was well. . After that he was christened
Nurse Jack and more often called simply
"Nurse."
He had an almost womanish way of car
ing for them if tiny fell ill.
"He ain't a drinker and he can't play
cards worth a bill of frijoles. but he's
all right dosing medicine and such
things," explained the cowboys. >;,:.- :7_:;
Moreover, he was all right when it cam
to handling a horse or revolver, which
after till count more points in the cow
boy's estimation than bottle or card's.
Besides he had as a firm ally Captain
Dick, which in Arizona is the open sesame
to any cowboy's friendship.
Captain Dick did. not win his position
among the Arizona cowboys without first
proving the strength of his good right
arm. Captain Dick has never been a be
liever in the. law's delay. He has assisted
at more hangings than any Sheriff in the
Territory. Nor have the victims of his
sense of justice afterward been proven
innocent. Captain Dick makes sure of the
offender's guilt before he ties the knot.
It was in 1882, while he was still very
young, that Captain Dick's popularity
reached the high water mark. General
Fremont, the new Governor of the Ter
ritory, had introduced a bill in the Legis
lature, which was then in session, asking
that several thousand dollars be put aside
to equip a company of militia to be sent
to the southern part of the Territory tp
subdue the cowboys.

quest for the .militia â  had* come 'from a
*'ew England greengrocer, who had not
/et become acclimated to the cowboy and
his harmless Fourth of -July antics while
in town.
"What will tho militia do?" demanded
the legislators.
"Shoot the cowboys if they misbehave.
Order even at the price of blood," replied
the erstwhile Pathfinder.
Then a member from Yavapai County .
read a letter from "Captain Dick" invit
ing the militia to come to the southern
part of the Territory.
There are memebrs of that Legislature
who treasure a copy of that letter to this
day and challenge any one to .produce
anything as funny from Mark. Twain or
Bill Nye. Captain Dick proved his sense
of humor and his cunning with the pen
as well as the pistol. Several of the leg
islators favored sending the militia' just
so as to give Captain a chance to
write the militia's epitaphs, which was
the boon he asked for bestowing the hos
pitality of the cowboys.
Needless to say the bill was lost, and
Captain Dick woke up to find himself fa
mous on all : the Southwestern cattle
ranges.
Several years ago a number of cow
boys rode into Prescott and after fright
ening all the .barkeepers of the saloons
Into a comatose condition, breaking glass
ware and practicing fancy shots, they re
mounted their horses and rode through
the town, wildly shooting at the clouds.
A posse of citizens was. formed and a
mile or two out of town they overtook
the hilarious cowboys, killing one of them
and wounding several.
The pursuit and killing aroused indigna
tion throughout the Territory. The cow
boys had done no real or serious damage,
according to Arizona ethics, and accord
ingly they should have been allowed to
go their way unmolested. Besides, they
had wasted all, their ammunition and they
had not. a fair fighting chance.
Such was the general verdict of the af
fair. KJM
The day after the killing Captain Dick
rode into the same town, galloped
straight to the Mayor's office and dis
mounted. He left it with a folded piece
of paper tucked. In his belt, it bore the
Mayor's signature promising to raise a
certain amount of money for the families
of the dead cowboys.
Two days later came a letter from Cap
tain Dick to the town officials. It de
manded an apology to the cowboys signed
by the Mayor and all the dignitaries of
the town, with the money, or there would
be some carefully aimed shooting from
the cowboys. And it was promised that
the townspeople would be at the wrong
end of the guns this time.
The money and apology, carefully
worded, besprinkled with seals and duly
signed by leading citizens and officials,
was hastily dispatched to Captain Dick..
- The i cowboys were satisfied with the
apology, and so the matter ended.
When this same Captain Dick was
stricken' with typhoid fever it was Jack
who nursed him through the dangerous
sickness,- and after that "Boy," which
was the captain's name for the youth,
usually; rode by the captain's side.
A year passed before the real identity
of "Boy", or "Nurse Jack" was discov
ered. It all came through the teacher
in the country school asking Jack to ride
into town to buy her some ribbon. It was
late in the afternoon when Jack reached
Williams, the nearest town. He was in
a hurry, and the startled customers iT
the' dry-goods store hastily made way
for a sun-brown, cowboy on a horse,
â¢who rode straight* up to the goods-cov
ered counter and demanded three yards
of" pink' ribbon. It is perfectly proper for
a cowboy to ride his horse Into a Arizona
saloon, but when it comes to a dry-goods
store it is a questionable procedure.
While the clerk was hastily measuring
off the ribbon a lady customer came too
close to the horse's hoofs and was
knocked unconscious.
The Constable and several deputies
proved too many for Jack and he was
straightway marched to jail. Captain
Dick came to town as soon as heard of
the affair. He called on "Boy" at the
jail, and to his surprise was shown to
the woman's ward. "Jack" had been
forced to reveal her sex or be put in the
men's quarters.
During the three days before the trial
Captain Dick became accustomed to
"Boy" in her new guise. She told him her
story; how her father had been hanged.
how her mother and little sisters had
taken refuge with relatives in Portland
and she herself had changed her name
from Helen Jackson to Jack Hall and re
mained in Arizona to love the life of a
cowboy.
On the day of the trial the injured wo
man, having recovered from her blow, re
fused to prosecute. However, the Judge
was called upon to use his official powers.
In the crowded courtroom Captain Dick
and "Boy" were made husband and wife.
The story was soon known all over the
Territory.
Not only the cowboys on that particu
lar rang but from far and wide the va
queros have sent congratulations and
gifts. "Nurse Jack's" wedding gifts will
always remind her of her year of cow
boy lifeâ riding whips, Mexican saddles
and diver spurs, to say nothing of sev
eral pairs of splendid riding boots and a
dozen sombreros.
Captain Dick Wells is going to take his
wife to Portland to visit her family; then
they will return to the stirrup and Ari
zona, which means home to them.
The cowboys have promised not to call
her Mrs. "Wells. She wants to be "Nurse
Jack" to them. .
And Captain Dick sa.ya.siie will, always
be "Boy." to him. . .DREYFUS: A CONTEST THET THREATENS
A FRENCH REVOLUTION
T}lF. first act of this most mystify-
ing and tragical drama began em
November _!, 1894. The opening
scene was In the office of General
deffre, chief of the general
Ftaff of the French armyâ by whose
order Captain Alfred Dreyfus of the ar
tillery, ' .-bed to the staff, was placed
under am .
"What for? What is the charge against
me?" demanded the astonished officer.
"You know very well.' was the answer,
nnd all the answer vouchsafed for seven-
en lays, during which time he was
"â sely confined and not allowed to com-
unicate with counsel, family or friends.
For some time previous to this event the
ench authorities had been .-..ware of the
ct of a mysterious and alarming leakage
military secrets from France Into other
untrles; and were on the "c .i vive" to
scover the traitor.
In September an Alsatian porter in the

'â¢ r. whii under the title of the "borde-
au." has gained world-wide notoriety.
This "bordereau" was placed by General
â â isdeffre In the hands of immandant
i Paty de Clam, who was considered in
c War 1 1 dice as an expert on handwrit-
er. for tho purpose of comparison with

)reyfus was taken to a cell In the
erche-Midi Prison adjoining the War
Hce. and kept In close confinement for
nearly three weeks. The fact of his ar
rest was made known by General Ifer-
cler. Minister of War. to his colleagues
In the Dupuy Cabinet, but withheld from
his family and the public.
In due time a Parisian journal published
the statement that an officer of the Mm
istry of War was at the Cherche-Midl un
der charge of high treas This news
created the greatest excitement in Paris
The n.-xt day it was announced that the
officer was on the general staff and be
longed to the artillery. Then that he was
an Israelite, and finally that his name
was Alfred Dreyfus; that he was rich
well married and of good social position'
This all made his crime more odious in
the eyes of the people, and not a voice
was raised in his behalf.
Dreyfus was arraigned before a court-
martial; the regular council of war then
sitting, those officers of Inferior rank to
the accused, were replaced by others
named by General Boisdi ffre chief of the
general staff. The trial began on De
cember 19. Dreyfus appeared clothed In
his uniform as captain of artillery, and
with his hair formerly black turned com-
pletely white during the seven weeks he
had been in prison.
The most rigorous secrecy was observed
on the trial, on the ground that the ex
amination would involve military secrets
of the highest importance.
The court was divided on the question
of guilt until General Mercier communi
cated to It a secret paper, the canaille de
D letter, later shown to have been
forged by Colonel Henry, which neither
the prisoner nor his counsel was allowed
to see, when a verdict of guilty as charged
was returned.
The clerk read the sentence to the pris
oner out. of the presence of the court, as
usual. It was military degradation and
perpetual imprisonment in an isolated
fortress.
Two weeks later the first part of the
sentence was carried out In the presence
of 5000 troops, drawn from the various
bodies about Paris.
As Adjutant Boxin tore the epaulets
and galons from his coat Dreyfus cried
out: "1 am innocent; I swear it. Vive la
France!" -r-_
His cap was taken, his sword broken
and thrown at his feet and he was th/Â»n
marched bareheaded around the square
before the troops, repeating frequently
his protestations of Innocence, which were
as ten drowned In the roll of the drums.
As he Passed the press stand he called
out to the reporters: "Tell all France I
am innocent." Officers standing near cried
out. "Silence, Judas! Down with the

He was sent to I'lle de Re, on the coast
of France, pending preparations for his
reception at I'lle dv t>iable, on the coast
of French Guiana, which had formerly
leeri a leper colony, to which latter place
he was sent on February 21, 1595.
Of his life there during the four years
that have followed little has been known,
as never was prisoner kept in more com
plete isolation. It is known, however, that
Lis spirits have kept up and his confidence
in his final vindication has not wavered.
This, has been gathered from circum
stances that have leaked out.
During 1883 and the . arlv part of 1896
some efforts were made in behalf of the

exile, but they came to nothing, as his
friends had no grounds on which to base
an appeal.
In the fall of 1896 Lieutenant Colonel
Piequart, not before known In the case,
was placed in charge of the secret ser
vice department, a most important and
fortunate event for Dreyfus. Piequart
esteemed truth and justice before the rep
utation of the army. After Dreyfus him
self he stands as the most important fig
ure in the whole case.
The leakage of secrets did not come
with Dreyfus' exile. Picquart's Investi
gations led him to suspect Major Count
Walsln Esterhazy. Then to exam
ine the secret "dossier" or papers
in the Dreyfus case. He became con
vinced that the "bordereau"' was Ester
hazy's work, and that Dreyfus was the
victim of a conspiracy.
He made this known to M. Scheurer-
Kestner. vice president of the Senate, like
Dreyfus, an Alsatian, a man of wealth
and influence, who was already Interested
in his behalf. In proper time the In
formation was laid before General Billot,
then Minister of War, with a request to
reopen the case, which was refused.
About this time. November, ISl'6. General
Mercier. to silence growing doubts as to
Dreyfus' guilt, caused a fac simile of the
"bordereau" to be published. On the trial
three experts had sworn that Dreyfus was
Its author, while two others swore that
the writing in no way resembled his.
Dreyfus' friends submitted it to the lead
ing experts of Europe and America, who
lecided unanimously that it was not writ
ten by him.
Esterhazy's guilt was at this time
known to no one. and only suspected by
Colonel Piequart. who was quietly investi
gating, but a year later the "brochure"
containing the 'fac simile and the expert
testimony met the eye of a broker, De
'astro, who had had long dealings with
the Count and possessed many specimens
of his handwriting, comparison with
which convinced him that Esterhazy
forged the "bordereau."
The broker communicated his suspicions
to Matt-leu Dreyfus, who denounced Es
terhazy to the Minister of War as the
author of the paper on which has brother
had been convicted, and demanded a re
trial. Esterhazy had already fled into
Belgium, but returned to Paris under
written assurance from the War Office of
its protection.
A court-martial was selected to try him
by General Pellieux, chief of the general
staff.
Esterhazy was acquitted on the ground
of "no tangible proof of his guilt," and
was congratulated on the result by all the
members of the court.
Two days later Emlle Zola took public
part in the fight by publishing in the

prosecuted at the same time and on the
same charge, began on February 7 before

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. SUNDAY, JUNE 11, 1899.
The attempts of Zola's experts to show
from the "fac simile" that Esterhazy
wrote the bordereau were ridiculed in tho
court and by the press. Generals Pellieux,
H.eiisdeffre. Gonse and Mercier all swore
that the bordereau could not have been
written by Esterhazy.
Colonel Piequart alone of all the officers
called stood stoutly to his fight, and
in defiance of the presence and testimony
of his superiors declared that the author
of the "bordereau" was Esterhazy and
not Dreyfus.
Zola and Pereux were found guilty and
sentenced to a year's imprisonment and
3000 francs fine.
Zola 'and his friends had to leave the
court under heavy police protection, but
the officers of the army were accorded a
grand ovation as they left the Palais de
Justice.
The Zola case was appealed and new
trial had on July I*.
On being refused leave to Introduce evi
dence reopening the Dreyfus case, or sus
pension of trial pending appeal, they let
the case go by default. The same sen
tence as before was given. Zola fled at
once to Switzerland to avoid the Impris
onment, and friends paid his fine and
costs.
On July 7 M. Cavaignac, in an endeavor
to allay the excitement of the public
mind, made a strong" speech before the

Chamber of Deputies vindicating the
course- of the War Department In the
whole case. In the course of his speech
he read three pcoers, one of which was
said to have bean written by Colonel
Schwartzkoppen to the Italian attache. It
was us follows: v>;
"I have heard that a Deputy is going to
Interpellate on the Dreyfus affair. If em
my return to Berlin the Kaiser shall ques
tion me 1 shall say that I have rjever had
any relations with this Jew. If they ask
you, say the same thing, for no one must
ever know that we had anything to do
with him."
Though he ordered Piequart under ar
rest In answer to his statement that the
above was a forgery, M. Cavalgnac began
to have his doubts, and calling Colonel
Henry before him questioned him on the
matter. Henry lied point blank until ap
pealed to on his honor as a soldier, when
lie confessed the forgery. He followed his
arrest the next. day by killing himself with
a razor that he had been permitted to re
tain. 6
M. Cavaignac resigned his portfolio at
once.'
The demand for revision of the Dreyfus
case became quite general, though there
was widespread opposition of the most
virulent kind. Newspapers that had been
hostile to Dreyfus now Insisted on his
having a new trial.
Premier Brisson publicly declared that
while the Cabinet believed in the guilt of
Dreyfus he himself was determined to
search the evidence and eet at the truth.
On September 17 the Cabinet voted to
submit the Dreyfus papers to a commis
sion of experts, and on the 26th, after re
ceiving their report, ordered Madame.
Dreyfus' petition for revision to be lalel
before the Criminal Chamber of the Court
of Cassation.
M. Quesnay de Beaurepaire, pres
ident of another branch of the court,
resigned his place and impeached the in
tegrity and impartiality- of certain mem
bers of the criminal branch. This forced
the Government to refer the whole matter
to the full Court of cassation, constating
of forty members. By thus referring it
to the highest and most august as well as
the most numerous tribunal in France tho
Government honed to secure the confi

SUBMITTED TO ALL KINDS OF PAIN
JUST TO SHOW HOW MUCH HE COULD STAND
Striking Experiments Made by a Professional Faker Who Used to Hire Himself
Out to Delude the Public as a Hypnotic Subject
THOMAS J. MINNOCK, the "Prince
of Horses," who has been a pro-
fessional hypnotic subject for the
last fifteen years, showed before
a party of physicians last Tues
day night some of the remarkable
tricks which he has been performing in
public to the wonderment of credulous
poisons and the glorification of the men
who have been making a profit out of
their supposed hypnotic powers, says
DR. EDSON, WEIGHING 210 POUNDS, STANDING ON THE SUBJECT.
the New York Press. Minnock was
anxious to show his feats before some
medical men, who, as he expressed it,
"are not suckers."
"I want to have you people see." he
said, "that I am not lying when I say
that out of two or three thousand fel
lows in my line of business, I am the
slickest. I have fooled hundreds of doc
tors in every State In the Union, and a
whole lot of big men in the cities. But
I am all through with it now, and I'd
like to show some good scientific men
just how I do it."
Dr. Cyrus Edson, the former Health
Commissioner, than whom there is no
better known physician in the city, was
pleased to express some curiosity about
Minnock, and so I got his consent to
preside at the ceremonies, which were
to include almost anything in the way
of self-torture and endurance from eat
ing cayenne pepper to nailing his hand
to a board.
"Get some cayenne pepper at a drug
store," said Minnock. "They call it
capsicum. Then you want to get some
snuff, and a bis needle and some black
thread and a couple of your wife's hat
pins, big fellows. Get a couple of nails
about like a horseshoe nail. I guess
that's all we need."
William Leary. the politician and
friend of Governor Roosevelt, went
along with us. Dr. Edson invited four
friends to see the performance â Ed
ward Mostert, Dr. H. T. Alexander. Dr.
Charles T. Ransom and Assistant Cor
poration Counsel Harold S. Rankin.
Theodore H. Lee, superintendent of the
'American Bank Note Company, called
.to see Dr. Edson professionally Just be
fore the show began, and he remained
_to watch the prince of horses eat pep
per and do other stunts.
While we were waiting for somebody
to bring in a hammer and piece of
"board Minnock divested himself of his
coat and walstcoast, lighted a cigarette
and stuck a hatpin about six inches
(long through the lobe of his right ear.

sign of blood.
"That's nothing," he said. "Won't
-one of you doctors kindly stick this pin
through my , lip?" So Dr. Ransom
stepped forward and planted the hat-
pin down through the Inside of Min
nock's lower lip, the point coming out
over his chin.
"There's an artery there, some-
where," * said the subject , jokingly.
"Did you stick it through that, doc-.
tor?"
Dr. Ransom said he had avoided the
artery, and then Minnock withdrew the
hatpin and called for an ordinary pin,
which he begged the doctor to "stick
right through the artery." Dr. Ran-
som said he pierced the artery this
time, but this was probably to please
the "Prince of Horses," because no
blood appeared.
"If one of you doctors will take my
left pulse and the other the right," be-
gan Minnock, "I will run one up and
the other down, just as you suggest." .
He seated himself in in a chair, and
Dr. Edson took his left wrist and Dr.
Ransom the right. Dr. Ransom re
marked that if it was Immaterial to the
subject he would take a slow pulse.
This- left the fast pulse to Dr. Edson.'
Both physicians held their watches,
and Dr. Edson, at the end of sixty sec
' onds, reported 120,' while Dr. Ransom
had counted but 114 beats.
"I can do better than that when I'm
in practice," said Minnock, "but I
haven't done any 'horse' work for sev
eral weeks lately." Then he asked the
doctors to explain how it was done, and
they promptly replied that he had ex
ercised muscular contraction in one
arm and interfered with the regular
flow of blood from the heart pump into
that wrist.
"I guess that's right," said Minnock,
"but I have made a whole lot of people
who are not doctors believe that I had
two hearts. Of course, that was when
I was hypnotized, you understand."
And he laughed.

took him some little time to swallow
the whole dose, and it was evidently
hard work. He got it all down* finally,
and there was no coughing or other'

smiling when he opened his mouth
again.
"Of course, if I were getting paid for

this," he said, "'and the hypnotist was
telling the audience that I imagined it

my lips and holler for more. But I
guess I don't have to do that with you
gentlemen." Then he made his little
speech. "All these other fellows," he
said, "when they take red pepper get
about as much as you can get on a
knife. I am the only 'horse' that takes
a whole teaspoonful. That's what you
call a toxic dose, doctor?" Dr. Edson
assented.
"Have you got something that will

a bad lung." This was one of Mm
DANCES THE INDIANS ARE HOLDING IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA.
The White Deer Dance,
Recently the Indians in the northern
part of the State have been holding
dances. The Indians of Mendocino and
Humboldt counties have always enjoyed
the unique distinction of being the best
dancers of all American tribes. This as
sertion may seem somewhat bold, for In
all other respects they are not noted for
their Intelligence. Nevertheless the fact
remains that they are the best dancers.
When "Captain Billy," the notorious In
dian murderer, escaped from the authori
ties of Mendocino County he wandered
up to the northern part of the State,

dancerâ all of which he had learned In

nock's littlÂ£ jokes, and as he seemed to
enjoy it we all smiled politely.
Dr. Edson took a stethoscope and put
â¢it up against Minnock's right lung, and
Dr. Ransome used a phonendoscope
against his left. At the end of a few
minutes Dr. Edson announced that he
noticed a roughened breathing, but did
not find any lung lesion. Dr. Ransom
reported there was not a clear breath.-
ing sound from the left lung, what the
physicians term a clear versicular
breathing./*--
"If you examined me for a life
insurance company," asked Minnock,
"would you accept me for a big pol
icy?" '.'â¢-;
"Well, I might.'' answered Dr. Ran
som, laughing. "1 think I have reported
on worse cases." m.
"But would you ne satisfied that I
had a perfectly healthy lung?" per
sisted Minnock, who was evidently
somewhat disappointed that he had
not fooled the physicians. They admit
ted that the lungs did not sound as if
they were In the best possible condition,
and Minnock said:
"I know that, because I didn't hear
Mendocinoâ he was soon made a' captain
of the Indians in and about Yreka.
The illustrations here represent the
Humboldt Indians in two of their cele
brated dances. The red-headed wood
pecker dance is one that has excited- the
admiration of all the "diggers" of the
Pacific slope. It Is held usually in the
autumn, and the small bows and arrows
carried by the performers mean that they
are the superior marksmen of the tribe,
for only the- small weapon Is used to kill
the woodpecker-, and the . yellowhammer,
with which the headdress is decorated!'
It takes a cunning eye and a steady
hand to spot these little birds and drop
the breathing sound naturally. I'll bet
I can go to one life Insurance company
and they'll reject me after examina
tion, anil I'll go across the street to
another and they'll- accept me. I've
done that."
'â Minnock wanted to try' some stunts
with his heart now, and attempted to
make it beat fast and slow. .- The pre
vious experiments, however, had given
the heart such a good, strong beat that
it was With some difficulty he ran it
down from 112 to 96, and then we de
cided to time his " heart again later in
the evening.
"But I can give you the tobacco heart
now, doctor," he said, and Dr. Edson
put his ear up close to the young man's
shirt and burst out laughing when he
withdrew it.
"That's the tobacco heart," he said.
"It skips a beat occasionallyâ changes
its rhythm, as it were."
We didn't ask Minnock how he did
It, but the "prince of horses" volun
teered the information that he held his
breath to make his heart drop an oc
casional beat. Dr. Edspn nodded. He
knew it. *'. &;; $&&% .^-7--:
"Who'll hold this cigarette on my
skin?'' asked the 'horse,* as he lighted
one of the paper things and puffed the
end into a hot ball. He rolled up his
shirt sleeve and said, apologetically,
that while he didn't mind the burning
he'd rather have it on the arm than
on the hand or face, where the mark
could show. Minnock turned his head
and talked to me while Dr. Ransom
pressed .the burning cigarette on his
flesh until the fire was smothered. The
horse said he didn't mind it, as he rolled
down his shirt sleeve.
Then he described the stage fall as
he had done it on the road with the
professional hypnotist before an audi
ence. He said he managed to fall so as
to hit his nose in just the right spot to
set it bleeding freely, but he would cut
the fall out in deference to the fact that
he was in a private house, and the
operation was a pretty noisy one when
done properly. In place of that he
doubled up his fist and began punching
himself in the nose. This was really
quite amusing to those of us who were
looking on, but Minnock after one par
ticularly hard blow was forced to ex
claim:
"Ouch, that one hurt!" He started
the blood at last, so that It showed
crimson in the receptacle which hail
been provided for such an emergency,
and then he remarked, "Now, I'll stop
It, and it won't bleed again, either."
Sure enough it stopped. ,
Minnock said this trick always took
particularly well when he was under
alleged ' ypnotic Influence, because, in
the first place, the fall and the result
ing flow of blood were startling, and
then the wonder of the onlookers was
largely increased by his apparent abil
ity to obey the hypnotic professor's de
mand to "stop bleeding."
When a call for volunteers was made
nobody jumped at th" opportunity to
hold a lighted match while Minnock
held his little finger to the flame. Dr.
Edson finally had to be the torturer,
and the "prince of horses" suffered his
finger to be burned and blackened and
scorched and blistered while he made
remarks about a party of medical men
in Bridgeport, Conn., who nearly
burned his thumb off once with wax
tapers.
"Of course I was supposed to be in
hypnosis," he said, "and I had to laugh
because the professor said they were
tickling me. I tell you it is a hard
business on the poor horse."
The 5-cent package of snuff which I
had bought in Park row was opened
and emptied out into a bowl. Dr. Edson

ute afterward. We wanted him to
sneeze, but he didn't.
"it's snuff all right." said the doctor,
and then Minnock proceeded to take
large and copious pinches of it, and ap
parently stuffed them in his nostrils.
I say apparently, because I don't be
lieve, and none of the rest of us be
lieved, that he took a very great quan
tity. It was enough, however, to have
made me sneeze, or almost any other
man. But it had no effect on the "hyp
notic horse."
The torture of the dropping of water
on the eyelids, or, in fact, on any part
of the body, was suggested next, and
Minnock leaned back In his chair and
told Dr. Edson to lei the drops fall on
his eyes until he got tired. With a
medicine dropper and a large glass of
water the physician stood over the sub
ject and let the big drops fall on his
left eye. Mi/mock lay like one sound
asleep or dead, without motion or
twitching of any muscle. This inter
ested William Leary, and he held the
watch 'on the- proceeding, announcing,
when Dr. Edson had about emptied the
glass and Minnock had said that he
could stand It all night, that the time
was two minutes and forty-five sec
onds.
"His will power is very strong," was
Dr. Edson's comment.
Then Minnock announced that he
would go into a cataleptic state and

cared to climb upon his extended body.
He stretched himself rigid on the car
pet and two men lifted him up by the
head and feet as they would a plank,
depositing him across two chairs. His
head and neck rested on the seat of one
chair and only his feet and ankles on
the other. The artist was the first to
step upon Minnock's stomach, where
he stood proudly for a moment or two
without any effect on the support be
neath. Then he gave way to Dr. Ed
son, who weighs 210 pounds, and Min
nock, who was as stiff and, apparently,
as strong as a steel rail, called loudly
for more weight to be piled on his
stomach.
Dr. Ransom took a surgical needle
about the size of a common darning
needle and disdaining a thimble, which
stood conveniently by, used a needle
holder and proceeded to sew up Min
nock's lips with neatness and dispatch,
likewise some black thread. He tied
the thread in a knot, and Minnock
murmured out of the corner of his
mouth something to the effect that it
would be a good thing to muzzle some
of the hypnotic fakers in the same way.
When the needle was withdrawn he an
nounced himself in condition to show
how he could destroy the reflexes in his
body with ease.
He sat in a chair with one knee
thrown over the other and Dr. Edson
took a wand of light wood about the
size and length of a policeman's night

Ed to rap Minnock's right knee. At the
first attempt he hit the spot, and the
subject's leg twitched and his foot went
up. in the air about two inches.
"That's too bad," said Minnock.
"We'll have to try again." He got up
and walked around his chair, and then
reseated himself.
"Now, go ahead, doctor," he said, and
Dr. Edson hit the spot that causes the
reflex of the knee about twenty times
with never a movement of the young
man's leg.
Then Minnock leaned back in his
chair, turned up his eyes, and Dr.
Edson prodded the pupil of the right
eye with his finger. Minnock said that
by long practice he had been able to
overcome the sensitiveness of the pupil.
This practice, the exercise of consid
erable will power and concentration of
thought, constituted the only explana
tion the subject could give. Cocaine
probably wo,uld put another man's eye
in the same unsensitive condition, but
no cocaine was used on Minnock.
After telling us that he could keep
his respiration down to two or three a
minute for several hours at a stretch
we concluded to take his word for it,
as the hour was drawing toward mid
night. Minnock said that once when
he was put in a coffin and was sup
posed to be in a hypnotic trance for
seven days, so. close a watch was kept
upon him that he got no food for four
days and a half. He believes he would
\ have died of starvation except for the
fact that he drew less than 12,000
breaths in all that time.
Twelve thousand breathy seems like
a good many, but I don't think they
would last the writer one day.
Minnock is very proud of the tricks
he can do with his heart, and he ran
it up and down for the doctors at s^uch
a surprising rate that after one ex
hibition Dr. Ransom, who had been
listening with his ear against Min
nock's chest, remarked earnestly:
"Well, if you came into my office with
that heart I'd put you to bed and
charge you $5."
Minnock said first that he would
show what he could do ins the way of
making his heart beat fast. He fixed
his eyes on the carpet, and after a
minute or two of thought told Dr. Ed
son to time him. The heart showed
12S beats per sixty seconds.
"That was a great horse race I was
thinking about," remarked Minnock
when the result was announced. "Did
you notice that the last few beats be
gan to get slower, doctor?"
Dr. Edson said this was true.
"I tell you how that was," said Min
nock. laughing. "I had a good field of
horses, and the one that my money was
on had a bad start. He came up all
right, though, and got away with the
field, all except one horse, who male
the running almost neck and neck with
him nearly up to the wire. I had a lot
of money on my horse and I was in a
strange town, and if he lost the race I
was broke. Just as they got to the wire
I thought up the hottest finish that 1
ever imagined in my life, and my horse
won by a nose. I guess my heart was
going all right then, but the minute
they passed the wire it was all off. And
that was when the heartbeats began to
go more slowly. If I could only hays
kept that finish up a couple of seconds
longer I could have made 140.
This is Minnock's secret for making
his heart gallop like a racer while he is
sitting calmly in a chair apparently
trying to go to sleep. The ordinary
man can make his heart jump by tak
ing a quick turn around the block, out
it is given to but few men to possess
Minnock's accomplishment. In describ
ing his failure to keep his heart gal
loping the last couple of seconds of the
minute because his imaginary race
ended too soon, he remarked that he
had "over-trained." His imagination
serves him equally well in keeping his
heart down, as he showed a few mo
ments later, when Dr. Edson felt his
pulse and counted the beats out loud,
with his eye on the watch.
Then came slower a_id slower as the
sixty seconds waned, until finally Dr.
Edson stopped counting and explained
when he had snapped his watch:
"They got going so slowly they threw
me out." Minnock's heart on this test
ran a little less than seventy beats to
the minute.
I asked Dr. Edson the next day what
he thought of Minnock and his per
formance, and he said it was a very
remarkable exhibition of will and of the
power of the mind over the body.
Minnock himself says there is no such
thing as hypnotism; but that is because
he has 'been a trickster all his life, and
the word itself with him is synony
mous with trickery. One of the most
rabid believers in everything which
bears the brand of hypnotism whom I
know told me the other day that Mm.
. nock, despite his own confessions, is
really a pure hypnotic subject, and that
all his feats of enduring pain and other
performances are the result of auto
suggestion. H '.
"He hypnotizes himself," announced
my friend, decisively.
With such men as these I have no
patience, nor with the myriads of fakers
who practice on the credulity of the
public with just such stool pigeons as
Minnock.

The making of brooms and baskets be-

naturally turned to that occupation.
Brooms and baskets were high in those
days. He acquired great skill in their
manufacture, consequently he made good
wages, out of which he contributed to the
support of his widowed mother.
"The knack of saving money." said Mr.
Chandon. "was a. virtue of which I knew
f nothing and thought little of until I had
lost my sight. With me 'to see was to
want, and to want was to have.' Without
my eyes I could see nothing, and seeing

and at the sound of his echoing "Whoa!"
the eight mules, which had great respect
for the word, came to a halt in front of
the general store, In Marysvllle. Clumsily
climbing down from his lofty scat, the
driver nailed a sign on his wagon:
"THIS OUTFIT FOR SALE."
And without more ado proceeded to

SUPRISING ROMANCES
OF STRANGE COINCIDENCES
FEW things In life are more surpris
ing than its coincidences, some of
which are so startling and. improb
able as to assume the appearance
of fate.
Charles Dickens was dogged
throughout his life by the most perplex-

one of the most remarkable of them all.
On the Sth day of June, 1865, he escaped
death by a railroad accident as by < a
miracle, and in commenting on his escape
he wrote: "I can never be much nearer
parting company with my readers forever
than I was then until there shall be writ
ten against my life the two wordsâ 'the
end.* " These two words were written
by death five years later on the same day
of the same month.
A more remarkable coincidence still was
noted in the death of Mr. Potter, the free
trade champion and friend of Cobden and
Bright,' who died at the same day and
month as his wife, who had preceded
him by twelve years.
It was a strange coincidence that led to
the identification of one of the most skill
ful burglars of recent years. The criminal
had been arrested on suspicion of having
committed several daring burglaries In
the Midlands, and was lodged in Hollo
The blind man hurried to town. The
owner of the outfit was found, a bargain
whs quickly made, and for $1000 the team
and wagon became the property of the
blind man.
Leaving his ranch and factory to the
can of a trusted employe, Chandon
launched out upon another enterprise.
Second thought was not necessary to him.
Before sunset of the same day the wagon
was loaded to Its utmost capacity with
hams, bacon and provisions, and with
Chandon and his "eyes" upon the high
scat went rumbling over the rough moun
tain road, headed for "the mines."
There was no difficulty in disposing of
the goods or getting a load of lumber for
the return trip to Marysvllle. Trading
was both pleasant and profitable to Mr.

would not refuse me a refuge for at least (

city with the dear Spanish name, to beg

old lady declared. "The favors of royalty
are fleeting and husbands are sometimes
cruel when they cease to love. I was not
poor In those good days of California.
and my husband as well as myself made
her welcome.
"Why did she marry the man who is
so poor, si. far beneath her former so
cial position? She desired a heme of her
own. and when the news of her husband s
death came we a .vised her to marry
again. There wen no Spanish dons seek
ing wives in San Francisco, but the
American senors brought gold from the
mines and won wives by displaying their
wealth. The American with his bags of
gold dust met and loved her. Then my
husband died, and l learned that I should
be very poor and could not give her a
home any more. s^
"Ah, how his gold disappeared after :
they wore married! He denied her noth- I
ing, while he speculated in stocks; and at
last It was all gone. lie was not a good ;
business nan and he had no profession.
Then from constant grief came illnessâ
that awful stroke which '->ok away her
beauty and strength, which made one
half of her dead while the other half was
living.
"They had doctors at first; but doctors i
must be paid, and they soon had nothing
with which to pay. No, she never told
him who she was, how far above him she
had been reared, and he believed her to
be but a poor Spanish widow, eared for
by friends, and was glad to think he could
give- her a home. He was very sorry for
her sake when the money was all gone,
though, but for himself he never appeared
to mind. Whatever he may have lost, he
still had his heart left. . Yes, Jesu Maria,
his heart is still left,"
We thought of the room which had
formed the background to the woman on

rusty stove, its table with broken dishes
and the bed in the corner with its ragged

way prison. Although it was clear that
the man was a practiced burglar, it was
found impossible to identify him and
thus trace his career In crime.
Fate or coincidence, however, did what
Scotland Yard was powerless to do. One
of the warders of Wormwood Scrubbs,
who had served in the Scottish Borderers
In India, saw the prisoner and recognized
in him an old soldier comrade named
Hely, who had been imprisoned fojr felony
at Calcutta. This clew was followed up,
and led to the disclosure of a long list of
crimes and convictions.
An almost incredible triple coincidence
was noted in France a few years ago.
In 1894 the deputy for the Ardennes was
a M. Ferry; for Loir et Cher, M. Brlsson,
and for the Vosges, M. Hugo. In 1793, 101
years earlier, each district had been rep
resented In the chamber by a man of ex
actly the same name.
By a happy coincidence the three sons
of a Birmingham man named Howes all
returned from different parts of the world
unknown to each other on the same day. -
One son, who was in the Capo Mounted
Rifles, had started home without his
father's knowledge, and to the latter's in
tense surprise met him on his return from
business in the eveuinc. Father and una
Chandon. There was money in hauling
freight. With two teams more money
could be made than with one. A second
team was bought and pressed into serv
ice; then a third, and so on until be had
five teams trading and hauling in the im
mense district of which Marysvllle was
the hub.
For seven years he conducted this ex
tensive and profitable business when in
creasing competition so reduced his rev
enue that he disposed of his teams, one
of which he traded for fourteen tons of
broom corn, which he utilized to a profit
of $250 a ton. i
Then he sold his broom factory and de
voted Ids whole attention to the develop
ment of his farm. ,*
When Chandon planted potatoes the
had barely reached their home when a
knock at the door heralded a second son,
who had unexpectedly come from India;
and later in the evening the family circle
was made, complete by the arrival of a
third son from London.
In no case had either the father or sons
any suspicion of the strange chance that
was bringing them all together from the
corners of the earth.'
A very touching coincidence recently
brought his two long lost daughters to
the deathbed of a man named Nails, in
the Bloomfleld Hospital, New. Jersey.
During the Civil War Nails had fallen
into the hands of the Confederates, and
after a long term of Imprisonment had
been sentenced to be shot.
neighboring farmers took It for a never
failing sign of a high potato market.
When onions were planted on the Chan
don farm the inevitable jump in onions
was looked for' by all. and somehow it
usually followed. When Chandon stored
his barley every one stored his. and when
Chandon' sold his wheat his example was
followed by the other farmers. Somehow
the blind farmer seemed to have a keener
perception than his neighbors of what

several years wandered about the States

there for many years, until a serious ice

when he recognized in a lady visitor an |
old Virginia neighbor of his, who knew :
the whereabouts of his lost daughters.
Within a few days the daughters were at
his bedside, ministering to the father they !
had lost for thirty-five years.
It was almost more than a coincidence

the next twenty years that Chandon con

of his grain sown by other than himself,
and all other branches of the work wero
under his own personal supervision.
Horse breeding was an industry to
which he devoted a great deal of his time,
raising nothing but the finest stock,
"For," said he, "it costs as much to feed
a 'plug' as It does to feed a high-bred ani
mal." With him hor.-_ trading proved as
profitable as teaming, and the sharp-eyed,
sharp-witted man did not exist who could
beat him on a horse trade. His opinion
of a horse carried more weight than that
of many a veteran in the business. There
was never a defect in an animal so slight
that it would escape the scrutiny of his
finely educated touch and his developed
judgment. :,C
He raised and sold hundreds of fine
horses until "Blind Chandon's" stock wa3
known to everyl horseman.

most at his touch, and whenever an op
portunity to profitably Invest in real es

the remainder of his life in ease, and well

PARIS. France, June Public at-
tention is being forcibly directed
just at present to the aggressive
campaign against intemperance
which is being carried on in nearly
every country on the Continent, and
especially in France. The advance In this
country is absolutely unique of its kind,
as there never before has been any gen-
eral movement of a national nature. The
French have been wont to ' look upon
themselves as good examples of modera
tion, while they gave their pity to Ger-
many and England as horrible examples
of people who drink too much.
But France is now duly shocked. Dr.
Laborde of the famous FaCulte de Mcdi-
cine in Paris has calmly informed the
French that they are the most Inter
n of all the civilized -peoples on
earth, and gives science and figures to
prove it.
When this announcement was made to
the French, who frankly told the doctor
that he was mistaken and worse, the news
papers took it up and published columns
of Indignant protest against the slander
ous charge â and investigated as a second
thought. Then they changed their con
fident note, for In a series of articles pre
pared by M. Comely of the Influential
daily Figaro, It is shown that close to
fifteen liters, or about sixteen quarts, of
alcohol are consumed every year for each
of the 55.000.000 people in the republic. The
French find that instead of heading the
alcoholic list, Germany and the British
Isles come third and fourth In the rank
ing, as Belgium takes second place after
France, but with nearly a third joss in
its per capita consumption. Fifth In the
list is Switzerland, the home of absinthe,
and then, in the order named, there fol
low Italy. Holland, the United States,
Sweden, Norway and Canada, Norway
Is the- most temperate of any European
country. Canada leads the world In its
moderation with a per capita of over two
liters a year. Thin means that our neigh

than a seventh as much as the mother
country, whence many of them came as
French emigrants.

"Killing the Little Worm.-'
Drinking shops in the poorer qaurters of
Paris are open at 4 o'clock in the morning,
and even then there are shivering men
and women who have braved the nipping
air to "kill the little worm." as they call
their thirst for drink. In the poor quar
ters I have seen by night little groups of
women put their drink money into a com
mon fund, so the amount of alcohol may
be a bit larger than if they bought sep
arately, and they drink it oftentimes In Its
full strength. This use of "neat" drinks
is steadily growing. So fierce is the appe
tite for the strongest distillations that the
law compels chemists to sell methylatecl
spirits only in colored form, which means
that they are poisoned. Alcohol from
wood Is deadly, but popular with them. In
Paris they drink ether, In the north of
France turpentine is growing in popular
ity, and here and there a, case is found
where kerosene oil Is taken, although this
Is generally done secretly. Petroleum
especially has a terrible effect and causes
severe vomiting and -other sickness until
the stomach becomes inured to the horri
ble practice.

Terrors of Absinthe.
if absintheism Is not checked, France
may go insane as a nation. It is only
a few years since two old women living
in a secluded mountain valley In Switzer
land gave out their secret for brewing
drink of rare quality , from the little, ab
sinthe plants growing only in that local
ity, but now absinthe is known around the
world. Nowhere has its sale grown to so
great or threatening proportion as in
France, where Its excessive use annually
drives thousands to wild insanity. A
friend of mine here in Paris had an Eng
lish coachman who was a model servant
for years, but Who was noticed as be
coming a trifle erratic. One day he was
driving out with two or the children when
a sudden frenzy seized him. and he at
tacked them to. do murder. It was only
by help being at hand that he was over
powered, and he was led away a raving
maniac. It was found he was an ab
sinthe drinker in secret, and . had got
up to eight glasses a day. Such is the
effect of this insidious craze upon those
who follow it far enough.
in the last stages of this form of
suicide, the victim sometimes drinks six
teen glasses of absinthe in a day, and is
the most pitiable of all the types of
drunkards. : .
Cost of Absinthe.
In the better cafes absinthe costs 50 cen
times, or 10 cents, but in the "dives" it Is
only 3 sous a glass. As such it Is little less
than a deadly poison, especially when a
dash of vitriol is added to give it an extra
"bite." Vitriol is regularly used In many
of the cheap drinks, and even in the bet
ter ones.
Last week I; had an interesting talk
with Senateur Jules lo Jeune, Secretary
of State in the Belgian Cabinet, who is
pushing a bill to - prohibit the sale of
absinthe in Belgium. 1 ::y^, ;'â¢ '

over in Newport was equally out. of the question, for she'd recognize that
too. There was no time to hire one from New York. I was in despair,
when it occurred to me to go to the crack livery stable keeper and state the
case. Asked him if there wasn't some absent rich family from which he
could borrow a coach. Boys, only Inspiration sent me to thai man. He
had a coach. lb' bought it second-hand from a family that went to pieces
eight years ago. and had never been able to sell, rent or give it away since.
We went into the' purlieus of the barn and hunted it up. You never saw
such a dilapidated old rattletrap. Cobwebs, rust, moth eaten, paint that
looked as ii rats had developed their nails on it. I was deeply dejected.
"That thing can never be fixed up," I said. "Can't it. sir? I'll have it as
spruce 'as new in a week." We struck a bargain Inside of live minutes.
.As 1 was leaving him a thought struck me. "I think, if you have no ob
jection, I'll have mv coat-of-arms painted on the panel." "None whatever.
sir. it will make the coach more valuable. I'll just mentionâ you're
goneâ that you got tired of it and made me a present of it. See?" "A^j
you'll never give me away?" "Hope I may die if 1 do sir." Â«
Aha, boys. Just wait further developments.â T. 1
Friday.
Oh. boys, you should see that coach. You'd never recognize it for any
thing but "a member of the New York Coaching Club. She's as fin. as a
bird. She glistens like silk. And that coat-of-arms. Boys, that was a
stroke of genius.
But to the story.
The afternoon she was finished I sauntered up to where she was resting
after a game of tennis, surrounded by Jay Hutch and others, and re
marked: "Miss Osbourne, you are so fond of driving I couldn't resist send
ing for my coach. Will you get up a party and let me tool you up the road
to-morrow?" She opened her eyes jus! the ninety-ninth part of an Inch
wider. His eyes bulged. "Have you a coach?" she asked. "Why, yes.
Did I never mention It? It's a big thing to cart around, but since.- you
are so wedded to that sort of sportâ "
Boys, she actually blushed. Her eyes sparkled, then blazed. I'll swear
a look of relief came into her face. "Tod are awfully good to take so much
trouble for me." she murmured. "Why, of course, I'll go," anel she let me
sit by her all the evening at the Casino.
1 was in a terrible funk for fear he'd get onto the gameâ go down to
the station and Inquire if a coach had arrived or something. But he didn't;
hasn't brains enough.
Well, boys, you should have been there at 11 o'clock next morningâ
mean on the veranda of the hotel when the coach drove up. That blessed
man had provided me with his four finest horses, a horn and a man (in
livery) to toot it. All Narragansett had turned out to stare. The tandem
sensation wasn't in it. You ought to have heard the cameras click. Jay
Hutch was fairly weak in his knees. Of course, I had asked hijn to go, and
I made him sit by the plainest girl in the party both ways. My sister dis
appeared to laugh behind a door three times before we started.
Airs. Osbourne's eyes fairly grew to thai coat-of-arms on the panel, ami as
she said good-by she called me "my son."
She held her head higher than i v_r: and when she went up the ladder
her eyes sparkled as it she were mounting a throne. Of course, she sat by
me, and maybe she didn't take the trouble to talk! Maybe, too, you don't
think that spick-and-span coach, with its coat-of-arms on the panel and
the girls on th" top looking like a variegated bed of posies, and the horn
to â â¢:â¢ ii: cream color, wasn't a pretty sight. She wore white, as usual,
with shoes and gloves and hat the color of moss on a tree.
Well, boys, that day was a success from beginning' to end. I didn't
turn them over, though I two-thirds expected p.: it was so long since I'el
driven even one horse'â before 1 came here. We had luncheon at a club
twelve miles down the coast and drove back in the afternoon. You never
saw girls as gay. nor a man as glum as my hated rival. And boys. this
time to-morrow I'll be writing you my last letter, and you'll know the Dest"V
or worst. Just before we reached the pier I leaned down and said to her ?
in my firmest tones: "To-night, at the Casino Imp. 1 must have mv an
swer. It is the last time 1 shall ask for it." When a man owns a coach
(apparently) it give him a tremendous lot of backbone. She didn't blaze
at me this timeâ just flirted her lashes round on her color.

There was a hop at the Casino last night. As the clock struck the hour
of 10 T entered the ballroom with her on mv arm. Jay Hutch had the old
lady in tow. He took her up to the gallery- We staved on the floor All
the belles were waltzing with their pretty beaux. The gallery was filled
with a small fortune in gowns and diamonds. People crowded at the door
to see the famous folk enter. (How's that for descriptive work? You want
ed facts, so I've got a newspaper letter describing the last ball before me )
Well, we waltzed for a while. Others then claimed her, and I let her go
until the seventh waltz. You should have seen the look, with which I ac
comnanled the making of that engagement.
The seventh waltz arrived. We took a turn for the looks of the thing
but I whispered firmly (I was still on that coach): "We will go out and"

"Marian Osbourne." I said sternly. "I ask you for the last time, will you

I took out my watch. She knew I meant business. She hesitated ex

ALTHOUGH there Is no necessary
connection between early rising
and a brilliant career, it is an in- 1
teresting fact, Bays a writer in j

eminent men and women spend
less time in their beds and leave them
much, earlier than most of us.
Through the whole of his working life
the late President Faure was rarely, if
ever, In bed after 5 o'clock in the morn

rose at 5 o'clock even in the depth of win

CURIOS OF SAN FRANCISCO
"Oh. come to the Power, Mr. Venus,
Of queer things 1 have a few.
Oh, i'"me to the Bower, Mr. Venus.
And I will show them to you."
â From that Immortal bard Mr. Silas Wegg, la
"Our. Mutual Friend," Charles Dickens.
WE have a modern Boffin's Bower
right here In San Francisco.
But if you were to take a trip
to the Sanitary Reduction
Works at the foot of Eighth
street and were lucky enough
to be forearmed with a pass from the up
town office, you would there see some
things that would astonish you. 1 have
been there, and I have seen things enough
to keep me writing for a year to come.
Superintendent A. E. Boucher was kind
enough to show me everything that is
rescued from the dust heaps, ami they
range In importance all the way from bi
cycles to babies. The latter find was a
revelation to me. Of course. I knew that
there were people in the world who were
heartless enough to dispose of an unwel
come Infant, even in the ash barrel, but
I had always supposed that such persons
would have at least some regard for that
law of nature which says self-protection
is first. Nevertheless, the innocents do
come to the ash heap, and many of them.
too. Some of them came into this world
untimely, had lived for days, and one
pretty little mite came to its last ignoble
resting place dressed in purple and fine
linen.
(if course, this body had to be turned
over to the authorities at the Morgue.
The papers made a fuss about it and did
all that was possible to bring the heart
less criminals to justice; but, to quote
Mr. Boucher, "this is difficult. All this
rubbish is brought to us by scavengers.
We simply measure the number of cubic
yards in each load, after which it is
dumped into a receptacle provided for the
purpose. Next the pickers rake over the
material in order that they may separate
the metal from the vegetable matter. This
Is necessary because all bits of Iron and
glass must go into respective idles. Only
vegetable fuse goes into the furnaces,
where it is soon reduced to fertilizing ma
terial.
"Of course, the pickers find all these
things you term curios, and if the curio
happens to be the dead body of a child,
why. we can only report the matter at
the Morgue. We can't tell where it was
found."
Of photographs and letters there is
practically no limit in the dust heaps.
There are love letters, business letters,
threatening letters to unruly debtors, let
ters to the Coroner asking that a certain
disposition be made of the writer's body
after death, which Is sure to occur within
at least twenty-four hours after the ink
is dry; begging 1.-;; its from men with
large families, all on the verge of starva
tion, where the temporary loan of a few
dollars means the salvation of innumer
able lives; letters to the Board of Super-,
visors asking for the privilege to sell lead
pencils on the public streets without the
formality of paying the amount necessary
to purchase a license as prescribed by
law; sweet little perfumed notes from
schoolgirls, asking classmates to come to
luncheon on certain dates, with the prom
ise of lots of fun talking over old times.
In one special packet Mr. Boucher has
segregated the many foolish requests for
the re-turn of articles lost In this city,
which he has received since taking charge
of the works
One woman writes as follows:

There are few earlier risers than the
Kings and Queens of Europe, who might
pardonably indulge in later hours than
their subjects. In his younger days i the
Austrian Emperor used to rise at naii
past 4ln summer and 5 clock in inter,
and was paying his morning visit to the
stables when nearly all Vienna was sleep
ing.
'Hie German Emperor has never been a
(sluggard, and is usually hard at work In
his study at 5 o'clock and on horseback
at C. while the Empress shares her hus
band's love of the morning hours, and
may be seen cantering on her favorite
mare two hours before the world breaks
its fast.
King Oscar of Sweden and Norway Is
usually to be found among his beloved
books between 6 and 7 every morning, and
the Kings of Italy and Roumania have
also left their beds at this hour.
The young Queen of Holland, like her
mother, rises at 7, and at about the same
hour the Queen Regent of Spain may be
seen, in somber black, "fat and florid," on
her way to mass.
Many of England's greatest men have
scorned the delights of bed while living
"laborious days.'' Brunei, the great en
gineer, who lived to be 80, rarely spent
more than four hours in bed at any time
of his crowded life; and Sir William Ar
rol. the engineer of the Tay and Forth
bridges, and the Brunei of our day. rises
earlier than any of his employes, and will
frequently crowd twenty hours' work
Into one <lay during the progress of his
great enterprises.
Art, too, has its early risers among its
most eminent men. G. F. Watts, the great
academician, has rarely allowed his bed
to keep him away from his brushes later
than .'â¢ o'clock In the morning.â¢
TUESDAY
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JUNE 11, 1899.
Sir: Will you be so kind as to re
turn to me an upper set of artificial
teeth which were accidentally lost
nt my house last Saturday. I am
sure they were thrown Into the ash
barrel. 1 can Identify them if you
would be so kind as to send them
oat to my house. Yours, respect
fully, etc.
Another woman asks for the return of
a switch of black hair, which she is sure
was lost In the ash barrel, and threatens
"that if It is not returned to' her immedi
ately she is going to see about it: she
is going to find out if there is such a
thing as law and justice In this land or
not; and her husband is a lawyer, too.
So the safest thing Mr. Superintendent
can do Is to return that switch immedi
ately, and thereby save future trouble
and possibly the loss of his position."
There is one package of papers with a
most decided legal aspect which was
really interesting, especially the Inscrip
tion on the back. Evidently the documents
in this package represented the hard
struggle of some poor fellow who hail
tried his best to get ."head of the world
by carefully Investing his earnings in
what business men tell us is the true
basis of all wealth, property. The bundle
consisted of receipts for monthly pay
ments on a certain piece of property, and
the payments covered a period of over ten
years.-
This would not appear a very interest
ing find were It not for the last sheet of
all. which should first he read in order to
fully comprehend what the man's Inten
tions and struggles had been for that
period of time. It was a letter to the
writer's wife or sister, for it was ad
dressed to "Dear May," and read as fol
lows:
To-day I take- my first step to
ward prosperity. I have pur
chased a piece of property which
is valued at $10,000. Of course I
have not got the money, that is not
enough to pay cash down for the
property. But I have paid $2000
spot and the rest will come very
easy,* as I am only obliged to pay
$60 per month, and this Includes the
interest. Yes. this is my first step
toward prosperity.
Evidently the writer's first step toward
prosperity was taken on uncertain
ground, for after over ten years' walk in
the same direction, according to the bun
di,. of receipts, he- had given up in de
spair. On the back of this resolution of
good Intentions he had Indorsed in ink:
"To Hell With Prosperity; I quit."
Then he tossed the? bundle in the ash
barrel, where it found its way to the
dumps.
"Here," said Mr. Boucher, "is a note I
received this morning. Now I am going
to give this my attention, for I am sure it
comes from a broken-hearted little child.
See what she has to say:
Dear Mr. Dustman:'' l have lost
my poor dollle. I love her very
much, as she was a present from

"Now." said Mr. Boucher, "let us go and
see if we can find the poor little dollle
that opens and shuts Its eyes. Here you,
Joe; how many dolls have you raked out
of the hopper this morning?" â¢'â¢"-
- remark was addressed to a very
dirty man. evidently an Italian, who was
parading up and down the yard armed'
with an ordinary garden rake.
"Dolla, dolla. Mr. Bouch'; nota one dolla
1 find a to-day." __EBB-____y_B_-B_-_M_"Â»j
"Now, now, that will do. Joe," was Mr.
Boucher's reply; "I don't mean money.
J mean the little rag baby: you know."
"Oh, yes." lie knew, all about It now,
and led us over to a pile in one corner of
the Inclosure, where we found the rarest
collection of toys one would care to look
at. I now began to wonder how we were
to pick out "the poor little dollle with
blue eyes that opened and closed." ; But
1 learned to have great confidence in the
sagacity of my friend, the superintend
ent, and 1 am quite sure he, would have
picked out that particular doll had he not
been interrupt, d by a messenger from the
front gate, who said me one wanted to
see him on business.
He soon returned with an old man and
a little girl. From the anxious expression
on the face of the child I immediately
recognized her as the owner of "the bluer
eyed d .111." She was a sweet mannered
little thing, with a sad expression, which
coupled with the deep mourning garb she
wore told of a trouble which hart come
Into her young life very recently. Her
companion was very old Indeed, and
seemed to rely entirely upon the child for
instruction.
He mumbled out something about th*
little girl being his granddaughter an 4
that he was the only member of the fam
ily who could spare the time to bring her
so far away from home in search of her
lost dull. Then his eye caught sight of a
man driving a team into the yard, and
he seemed to lose all idea of his charge
or his errand, but finally ventured the
remark that tin- collar on the off horse
was too tight. After this bit of unsolicit
ed information the old man look a seat
on a box and continued to mumble to
himself. "Too tight, too tight.". |jg|
We gave him up and concluded to ask
the little one if she would be willing to
leave her grandfather there while we
went in search of "the blue-eyed." After
a thoughtful moment she said, "Yes, he
will stay here if 1 ask him to."
The child took Mr. Boucher's hand and
he led her to the doll morgue. "Nov/,
pick out your little one." he said, pleas
antly. "1 am sure you will find her here
in this pile."
The little girl separated the toys ten
derly and finally uttered a small excla
mation of delight as her eye caught sight
of the "blue-eyed one." She quickly
snatched the Inanimate mite from the
rubbish, and as the tears started from
her eyes cried: "That's my poor baby!
The dear thing, how she must have suf
fered."
And how she hugged the poor image to
her jiving heart.
"Now." said the superintendent, "take
your dollle home to your mother and tell
her Mr. Dustman is glad to be of some
service to her."
Here the' child began to sob convul
sively. "Oh, my poor, sweet mamma."
she cried; "my poor, sweet mamma. She
gave me that dollle and now she is dead.
That's why I love my <l"lll" so much."

COMEDIAN'S REVENGE
ON LEADING MAN
A MERRY war of words between the
leading man and the comedian of
a Vienna Theater resulted in the
latter vowing eternal hatred to his
rival and dire vengeance at the first
opportunity.
The prompter at this theater is an old
. lady, whose ceremonious dignity and
courtly manners have earned for her the
sobriquet of "Frau Hofrathin" iMme. la
Conseillere de Tour). The comedian elab-
orated a scheme to be revenged upon
; his enemy, and the prompter was the me-
dium he employed for carrying it out.
The leading man's memory was none of
the best, and he always placed great de-
pendence upon the prompter, who was
; very friendly to him. One scene In the
second act, a long and difficult one, al-
ways demanded her closest attention. '
One evening, the fatal night, she had
climbed the narrow staircase Into her
box, a staircase so narrow that It was im-
possible for her to turn, and she was al-
ways forced to make the descent back-
ward.
Some one had climbed the narrow stairs
and had started to cut off the buttons of
the old lady's boots. A struggle between
modesty and professional duty ensued.
She tried to get her feet out of the way in
vain; she struck out at haphazard, still
in vain. In the meantime she had lost
the thread of .the dialogue and the poor
leading man was plunging wildly in con-
fused sentences; the heroine was com-
pletely at sea and the curtain was rung
down amid a storm of Indignation from
the gods in the gallery. |

whom we found just where we had left
him. He Inquired anxiously "if we had
looosened up that collar on the off horse."
The child took the old man's hand, and
the last we saw of them 'they were on
their way to a car, the child hugging
her treasure and the old man looking in
vain for that "off horse with the tight
collar."
."Now," said Mr. Boucher, "we had bet
ter go over to the photograph gallery and
see what Bill can show us. His right name
is something" that sounds like Rillic'il
Vensanza, but we just call him Bill tor
short."
So we went over to see "Bill for short,"
who proved to he the keener of a small
eating house and saloon for the men.
The photographs were really worth
seeing. The first one I noticed was that
of Attorney George A. Knight. "Why." I
exclaimed in surprise, "is it possible that
this Is the picture of Mr. Knight?"
"And why not?" was Mr. Boucher's
answer. "I am like the old sextonâ
all come to my solitude, one by one. Bill
has a great collection of public men here."
Sure enough. It 'was the picture of the
eloquent Knight. Now. how do you sup
pose that photograph ever reached the
ash barrel, I asked? "Well, that Is a hard
question to answer, usually through ac
cident. I fancy. Sometimes a servant
soils a picture, and in order to avoid de
tection throws it in the dust heap; next
it reaches me." SRV

SWELL BOOK AGENTS
THE LATEST IN TRADE
THE really swell book agent is one
who sells books of rare and antique
character. There is a fortune in
this class of books. The prices
â¢ range from $50 to $500 or more, and
the persons. who. buy the works are
only too glad to receive a visit from the
agent who makes this class of books his
specialty. They leave their addresses at.
all book stores and advertise their hobby
far and wide. A rare edition they will
pay almost any money to obtain, and
there is a correspondingly large profit for
the agent.
Works of art or classics in limited edi
tions are disposed of only in this manner.
They can not be obtained through the
usual channels of trade. '- v' --_-;:â¢'Â» 'â '.'â 
The sale of rare old books In England
last year amounted to more than $500,
--000. There Is no report of the sales of lim
ited editions, which are never advertised,
but are disposed of only through agents.
These limited editions are printed on the
richest materials and they are works of
art as to the print as well as illustration,
which is often In etchings and water col
ors. Vignettes are often tinted by hand,
and the artist's proof of etchings are also
finished in water color by hand.
It is more easy to dispose of this class
of work than is realized by the canvasser
for ordinary books, and the agent some
times makes $10,000 a year in the business.
At the railway stations in Russia books
are kept in which passengers may enter
any complaint they may wish to make.

The late lamanted "Little Pete" occu
pies a prominent position on the walls of
the gallery In the form of a gorgeous and
highly colored photograph. He has posed
as a Confucian student, dressed in the
long and gracefully flowing garment
which is always worn in deference to the
great scholar's memory. In his left hand
he holds a. scroll, while the lingers of the
right hand toy gracefully with a beauti
fully decorated fan. Tho idea of that

magazine articles and all the pamphlets
that can be written on the subject. In a
case of succession a foreign lady chose as
her share of the heritage a bas-relief In
marble representing an exquisite Ma
donna and infant Christ, by Mlno of Fie
sole, as to the genuineness of which there
was not the shadow of a doubt. She took
it for a very large sum, nevertheless con
sidered by experts to be below its real
value. The lady had a reverse of fortune,
but she knew (or believed) that she pos
sessed a masterpiece, for which, more
over, she had been offered a high price.
She therefore felt certain of being beyond
the reach of want whenever she made up
her mind to part with it. The psychologi
cal moment came. In order that it might
be sold to the best advantage she sent her
superb Madonna to Rome, which is the
winter resort of all the "miiliardaires" in
the world on the lookout for ancient mas
terpieces.
I went to see the marble. It was a mar
vel, both as to workmanship and to
"patina.". But after it had . undergone a
long and careful examination by serious
experts, aided by a magnifying glass,
they came to the conclusion that it was
a modern copy mail" by a man of con
summate skill in working in marble. The
proof was clear. The dealer who had sold
the group was dead, his family were re
duced to poverty and gone away, and I
afterward learned that the Florentine
who had. made this marvelous copy, (equal
in beauty to the original) was. also dead.
The despair of the unfortunate lady may
be imagined when she learned that in
stead of being worth the 60,000 francs
which she had refused, her treasure, on
which she reckoned to provide for the rest
of her life was worth from 1500 to 2000
francs.

BOSTON has just made public claim
to the credit of being the first
city to start a school for nursery
maids. Her papers are writing
up the school at great length, as
if it were a notable development
In education. San Francisco can go her
at least a year better in that line of edu
cational work.
For more than a year past San Fran
cisco has boasted of possessing the only
nursery maids' school in the United
States. And this school is the outgrowth
of an Intelligent and persistent demand.
For many months prior to Hie inaugura
tion of the school the matter was earn
estly discussed In exclusive circles, and
the advantage of securing intelligent,
carefully trained girls for the care of in
fants fully recognized.
To meet, such a demand a school for
practical training seemed indispensable,
and to conform to tin- ideas of its pro
moters'must be purely beneficent in its
workings. Opportunity to put int.. ope
ration-plans that bad been . formulated
was not presented until' the opening of
the San Francisco Lying-in and Found

experience in the work of the Florence

face to face with the need for. a foundling

Is Woman a Fail-

Many are the arguments volubly em
ployed nowadays which make for prov
ing the eternal superiority of the eter
nal feminine. Mentally, intellectually,
morally, spiritually and otherwise we
hear of her (from herself) as a being
set apart, away from and overhead the
opposing and decadent gender, whom In
her greater strength of numbers she
would now force into the novel attitude
of a conquered combatant.
How is it that woman, while occupied
in waving -her flag of independence so
busily from the battlements, should yet
be obliged to cede first place' even in
the basement to, mere man, and that,
while ambitioning the post of control
ler, she should not be altogether, com
petent as cook?
Did woman ever thoroughly grasp or
govern the great art of Brillat-Savarin,
or Ude, or Francatelli, or Grimaud de la
Reyniere, or a hundred others besides,
the creators of . ancient, medieval or
modern epicureanism? As chatelaine or
hausfrau we know her; as a chef how
often? And why?
Physically and mentally, she is un

Woman, with less artistic Instinct

to another, her ambition rarely takes
higher flights than unlimited beer and

of Moncure D. Conway, the friend of
Emerson and the author of the yet,un

Her other work was a still life.
But the picture that was talked of most
and that, but for Its size, . would have

rity if not more honor for Miss McCKes
ney, was not hung. It was too large and
could not be accepted. Artists saw it in
her studio on the Rue Boissonade Instead
of at the great Salon. And they heralded
Its magnificence everywhere, so. that she
was forced to throw open her doors in
order to accommodate, on stated days; the
people who wished to view it.
The painting Is called "The Sleeping
Mother," and is now in New York, having
been brought across by Miss McChesney
very recently. It is the strong figure
workâ Miss McChesney has not
swerved from the line of genre selected
when in San Francisco several years agoâ
of a mother and a child. The mother,
though of the poorer classes, is Madonna
in face and majestic in figure. Her head,
robed in its dignity of the peasant stamp,
is thrown back in tired abandon and in
perfect enjoyment of â  a moment's sleep
snatched from work. The upturned face
is beautiful ami full of sorrow. It is out
lined and shrouded by long, black, coarse
hair. It is pronounced the faithful de
piction of a type not uncommon among
the peasantry and the finest piece of work
that Miss McChesney has yet done.
What gives beauty to the mother, fig
ure and feeling and sentiment to tin- can
vas, is the sleeping bain- snuggled close
to its mother's bosom. The face is hidden
mi ft the cheek and car. and the curly
head is pillowed softly on the dress of
faded blue. Divinity and love sit upon the
picture, out of the union in it of womanly
beauty and motherly grace.
, A companion picture, "The Sleeping
Child,", is as sweet in conception, if not
as strong. The mother, a peasant, leans
above her infant tenderly. And as a set
ting to the pretty scene is the interior of
the cottage. The face la more youthful
and less dignified. But i' is beautiful, and
therefore artistic and harmonious.
These pictures are now at the Academy
of Design, New York, and hundreds view
them daily. They may not reach this

ON A WIFE'S LOVE
/ I "y HERE is a deeper pathos in the
following letter than in those I us-
ually receive from unhappy in the
following letter than in those 1 us-
ually receive from unhappy wives,
because tills wife loves her hus-
JL. band with that love which Shakes-
peare speaks of as the only real
passion.
"Love is not love which ..iters when it
"Love is not love which alters when it
ration finds."
To a wife whose love has given place to
anger, disgust and indignation, It Is easy
to give advice. I always have and always
shall maintain that the only thing for
those women to do is to separate from the
men they hate, as love, not law alone,
makes marriage legal. But this wife is
another type. She says:
"If a wife learns that her husband has
wronged her in every way In which a
man can wrong the woman he has made
his wife, do you think it possible for her
to 'forgive and forget' and try to take the
Interest in her home and family that is
expected of every wife and mother? Such
an experience has come to me. I should,
perhaps, learn not to care if lie were un
kind or careless, but my love will not die,
and I suffer so that my life is one long
heartache. This state of affairs has last
ed for more than a year, and I wonder If
you can understand my feelings. It is
not only the knowledge that he has com
mitted a sin, but the knowledge that ho
has preferred other women to me which
is so hard to bear."
It Is useless to tell this wife to leave
her husband, since she would leave her
heart with him. When a woman loves
despite herself, the only thing to do la
to keep on loving and to hope for tho
ultimate regeneration of the sinner. Love
like this can accomplish miracles. Only
one woman ever loves the same man In
this way during his lifetime. Let her
take what little comfort she can In that
thought, and let him take warning from

it. If he loses her love by and by, he
loses his one chance of happiness on
earth. No matter what temporary infat
uations he may experience or. inspire he
will never be really loved again.
The man who crucifies such a love as
this wife feels, must some time, some
way, pay the penalty. It is the unpardon
able sin.
A sorrowing wife writes me for coun
sel. She was a very happy and content
ed woman during the first five or six
years of her married life, j Her husband
was devoted to his home, and proud of
his wife and two little children.
Then he was sent "on the road" by the
firm which employed him. Two weeks
of each month were passed away from
home, and he wrote of being lonely and
very homesick.
After he naei made six or eight of these
journeys to other cities, there one day
came a revelation to. the wife. She found
a letter from a young woman written to
her husband which called for explana
tions. The husband came forward and
made a clean breast of It. He said he
had been desperately lonely while away,
and he had made the acquaintance of this
young woman at an interior hotel, and
he had taken her out twice to the the
ater, merely to kill time. . He had not
mentioned' the fact of being a. married
man to her, and he had no Intention of
pursuing the acquaintance any ! farther.
He "thought his wife very foolish to take
the matter so seriously to heart, as he
had done no real wrong; only yielded to
a weak impulse in a moment of loneli
ness."
Meanwhile the wife writes me that she
feels all happiness is forever over for
her, and thinks she might as well take
her two children and go away now as to
linger along for years In wrechedness.
She asks me if I can see any excuse for
her â¢band's conduct.
This wife must take into consideration
the way men are brought up. They are
never taught self-denial or self-control by
their parents. Girls learn early In life to
curb their impulses and to bear loneli
ness and solitude with patience. They
learn to go without pleasures, for the
sake of duty or appearances. But boys
are given a night key and are allowed to
amuse themselves.
No happiness can be restored by con
stant nagging references to this experi
ence. Let her try to be her old sweet
self, and see if he will not recognize the
great blessings which have been be
stowed upon him by Providence, and rea

his part is a small price to pay for a

"THE HORSE FAIR": ROSA BONHEUR'S HOST FAMOUS PAINTING, v NOW IN THE HETROPOLITAN HUSEUM OF ART, NEW YORK:
ROSA BONHEUR, the famous French animal painter, who died
a week ago at the age of seventy-seven at her home in Fon-
tainebleau, was the only woman who ever received the cross
of the Legion d'Honneur for intellectual achievements.
Rosa Bonheur always wore men's clothes. She was burled
In them, and on her breast was the cross of the Legion d'Hon-
neur.
In the grave near Fontainebleau Is the cross that the beautiful
Empress Eugenic herself presented to Rosa Bonheur in 1865. In that
year a terrible epidemic of cholera was raging In Paris. Eugenic In-
sisted on accompanying her husband on his visits to the hospitals.
In admiration of his wife's bravery Napoleon 111 presented her with
the cross of the Legion d'Honneur. , .\:;.
A few days later the cross for "intellectual achievement" was be-
stowed upon Rosa Bonheur.
The Empress Eugenic herself carried it to the artist. Mile. Bon-
heur in her studio trousers received the Empress; who cordially kissed
and embraced the artist.
When Eugenic left Rosa Bonheur discovered pinned on her shoul
der the famous and coveted decoration. Mile. Bonheur thus became
a "chevalier" of the empire, which honor the French republic con-
firmed by making her an "'officer" of the Legion d'Honpeur.
Rosa Bonheur, who won laurels that have ever been beyond the
grasp of her sex, was not born with the proverbial golden spoon. , The
great artist thus described her early life to an intimate, friend,'. who-
immediately wrote it down, catching the vivacity and humor which
ran through the recital: â¢ ?: - --._â¢.';
"My father was a teacher of drawing in Bordeaux, and. had his
hands full bringing up four children on his slender salary. My mother
assisted as well as she could by giving music lessons. My mother
died when I was about seven, and Bordeaux became intolerable to
my father. SPMII|II-!II_JJ,_|E
"We came to Paris and father sent us to an .honest childless
widow â 'Mme. Catherine,' as we called her. Mon Dle'u! how unen-
durable it was for me to sit beside the old lady all day long and sew '
or knit orâ pire encore help in domestic work.
"Whenever we escaped Mme. Catherine's watchful eyes we en-
Joyed ourselves my sister Yuliette (now Mme. Peysolle) by painting
sheep, my brother August drawing cows, Isadore moulding clay and
I picturing everything as long as it could creep, crawl, Jump or fly.
We used to ramble about the Bols de Boulogne, which was a wilder-
ness then compared to what it Is now.
"One day father came home full of Joy and told me he would be
able to put me In a boarding school in exchange for drawing lessons.
It was one of the best boarding schools in Paris, where there were
young ladies who were taught the fashionable accomplishments,
"My good father wished for a simpler kind of education, more in
harmony with his means. But choice was not left to him and he
eagerly seized on this fortunate opportunity, â¢ consoling himself that
I would become an accomplished young lady and that my Intercourse
with well-bred girls would modify my abrupt manners.
"Poor father! How well do I remember myself In ray thin print
gown and disheveled hair. My total unconcern about dress horrified
the other pupils, who called me "little beggar."- But I cruelly avenged
myself. I made pen and ink caricatures of them and took care not
to flatter. BWfi_____(Mp<_Pt
"After a particularly, funny caricature they would lock me up in
the cellar, where I would Joyfully pass the time sketching my cat
In every conceivable attitude. When they discovered how much I pre-
ferred the cellar to the schoolroom the cat was taken away, as well
as the paper and pencil.
"The next time they put me In the cellar I used the burnt ends of
matches to caricature the teachers. These I colored, cut out of paper
like paper dolls, and stuck to the celling of the recitation- room with
chewed bread paste. When the pupils filed in for their recitations
they went oft into spasms of laughter at these pictures. Finally the
cause of the undue laughter was discovered and I was severely pun-
ished.
"My last escapade was too much for their good humor. I organ-
ized a girls' brigade and made a mock battle charge through the
seminary garden, knocking oft the blossoms in lieu of actual enemies'
heads.
"Bien! then I was sent home in disgrace. Mere Catherine ad-
vised my father to apprentice me to a dressmaker. This he unwill
ingly did. After cutting up some beautiful material Into horses'
heads the dressmaker refused to have me. I could sketch, but I <"
would not stitch."
About this time Papa Bonheur began to recognise that his daugh
ter had genius which could not be quenched and he began to instruct
and direct her. The family lived on the sixth floor, Just under the
roof, and here Rosa tasted the first sweet of happiness, for the little
girl .was Allowed to give her talents *uU OjDJ, *yiW**"' *w -r - â¢*'""
<Â»- â ' â¢ID .
On the roof she kept her. petsâ pair of rabbits, an owl, a dog,
a cat and a dearly beloved little goat. When she thought the goat
needed an airing in the park she would take it on her shoulders and
carry it down the six long flights of stairs and back again in the same
way. After her would follow the dog and cat, making as queer a
group as was ever seen on the queer Parisian streets.
Rosa's family of animals never quarreled. She exercised a mes
meric influence over these animals. Under her gaze their dispositions
harmonized, and her cat, her dog. her rabbits and the goat and the
owl all lived together in perfect peace and happiness.
About this time she went to study at the- Louvre, where she
made copies of the great masterpieces. The first money that she
earned from painting was from the sale of these copies.
One day she made a study of her goat with the grandeur of Its
natural surroundings.
"It is wonderful!" was her father's comment. After that no more
copying from other artists; no more hurried charcoal sketches of her
own pets. Rosa devoted herself seriously to painting animals from
nature. -â  â¢ . "*Â»"*â¢ â â¢';.- 2
Rosa was yet in her early teens, but dresses and parties held no
attraction: for her. She rose at daybreak,' walking the weary miles
to th.' pastures .where the cattle grazed. At noon she ate a scanty
lunch which she carried With her, and after a day's laborious pointing
there was a weary walk home, a simple supper and a few hours' rest
Finally she thought, of visiting the stockyards and abattoirs She
went wild with delight at the opportunity afforded for study.
Rosa straightway cropped her hair, donned boys' attire and be
came a fixture at these places. Stories without number are told In
Paris of associations with the drovers and butchers. She Jostled with
the stockyard men, sat on boxes and fences all day sketching the
animals, even setting her easel In the slaughter-house and painting
the poor animals in , their mute death agonies.
Somewhere in 'her chateau it is said that Rosal Bonheur has hid

Once when Mile. "Bonheur was returning from the country in her
usual male attire she heard that one of her girl friends was ill, and
without changing the costume hurried to the sick-room. While she
was seated on the bed affectionately holding the patient's: hand the
doctor came In,. and seeing a young man in such a familiar position
hastily closed the door. and, discreetly retired.
The sick girl saw- that 'Rosa's male attire had led the physician
to believe what was far from the truth. Rosa ran after, the doctor,
luckily caught him on the stairs, and left him surprised . that the
young man whom he had left tete-a-tete with his patient was a
woman artist. . .â - .- â  â  â  . *-..'-â '.
All this. time she was so poor that even.the humblest of the men
In the stockyards had better fare than she. One of the men,- who
scalded and dressed calves' heads, noticed that the little artist who
came so regularly brought only a few pieces of â¢ bread, which an
swered for both breakfast and lunch. So he took her to his own house
to share his noonday meal. .
But the "Little Hussar" was soon to- taste the Joys of success.
She had painted two pictures of her house-top pets. They were
exhibited at. the ..Paris Salon in 1841 under the titles of "Two Rab
bits" and "A Goat and a Sheep." They were hung on the "line" and
much admired. . . â¢*â  * V â¢-*.*/

to paint : three more for the next exhibition. These were even more
favorably received; For twelve years after that she had pictures at

or less proud of her godfather. However
that may have been, certainly Clara Ward
could find some excuse for her nature in
her parentage. >._â¢"?';_- V;â¢ -, â  -r li '-_.
She was the daughter of Captain Eber
Ward, the richest man in Michigan-" who
at the time of his death, was possessed
of thousands of acres of pine lands and
the biggest fleet of , ships on the Great
Lakes, as well as a reputation that was
not envied anywhere west of New York.
Insanity developed In nearly all of his
progeny and Indications of the .' same
weakness early manifested themselves In
his daughter.
Of his children there was Lizzie, who
died In an asylum; there was Fred,. who
killed himself; there was Milton,. who be
came an outlaw ; . there was Charlie, who
became an outcast, and Â» Henry, who be
came Insane. â¢ By -a , second marriage
which Eber Ward â¢ contracted there were
additional childrenâ and ' Clara, - the
Princess Chlmay. The one disgraced him
self in Paris. It Is â of : the other this tale
Is being told.
â¢ When Clara first felt the taint that was
in her she was at school In London, where
her mother had taken her from Detroit
to complete ; her ; education. Something
happened * one day and â  beoause of it she
was asked to leave the place, and was
hurried by Mrs. Ward to less conventional
Paris. To one of her inordinate vanity
and love of notoriety. Paris proved a pro
lific field â  for the gratification of ; both.
She had , been but a week in her new
school when she disappeared, and after
eighteen days,' in which half the detective

her, she was discovered In the garret of a
student in . the artier Latin. "
'She was taken back to her seminary.
When her. mother reached home after the
ten miles drive from the school she was
astounded; at. being greeted upon getting
out of her carriage by Clara herself. The
girl explained later that being disinclined
for further schooling she had climbed ip
on top of the carriage and for ten mil.*
provided a" spectacle that startled even
the Frenchmen.
_ Clara's school days ended there and Mrs.
Ward, who . had become - Mrs. Alexander

tures. She sold a number of pictures at modest prices, and the money.
was used to lessen the pangs of poverty in the Bonheur home.
1n. 1853 -appeared the painting .which established her fame, "Tha
Horse Fair," now in the Metropolitan Art Museum in New York. She
sold' this originally for $8000, .which at that time was a fortune in
France. Ernest Gambart was the purchaser. Upon receiving the
money It seemed such a large amount to Mile. Bonheur that she vol
untarily offered to paint for him a' quarter-size copy of it. She gave
this to M. Gambart so that he could. have an engraving made of It
and recover some of the original cost of his picture. M. Gambart
afterward sold the original at a loss to William P. Wright of New
York for $4500. Â§ He in turn sold it to A. T. Stewart, the great New
York dry; goods king, for several times that â¢ price. , When Stewart's
art collection was sold' in 1887 Cornelius Vanderbllt bought "The Horse
Fair" for . the . Metropolitan Art Museum, and .he paid for it $55,000.
With : the" ', ' Horse Fair", money Rosa Bonheur was able to buy tha
beautiful chateau of By, in Fountalnebleau Forest, near Paris.
This --chateau -was built originally as a hunting lodge by Marie
de Medici. Mile. Bonheur remodeled it, making the upper story a
large studio. It floors were covered with the skins of huge animals j
bulls, bears, lionsâ some of which their artist owner had hunted and
shot and some were the preserved skins of pets. This studio as often
as not contained a live tiger, a lion or a ferocious dog that struck.
visitors . dumb with terror. â 
Rosa Bonheur herself felt absolutely no terror for animals. Ths
small hand that handled a brush with such power moved in the mana
of a -Hon without trembling. There was a wild lion, said to be *an>Â»'
tamable, which she kept at By In a cage for a long time. '3gW
The beast ' manifested great affection for Rosa Bonheur, who
placed herself before him, palette in hand, and made a study oat him]
in all his fierce magnificence. Now and then he would pass his greats.
paw between the bars and dumbly ask her for a caress.
But her retainers feared "Nero," and because she did not hava
time to train him herself she determined to send him to Paris to be
tamed. "Nero" was sad, as though he divined the coming separa
tion, j When the day of departure came and he started on his Jour-
ney he turned about with a look of griefâ almost of reproachâ tha;
eyes of that superb face where the Greeks found the lines for their;
Jupiter. . 'f
"Nero" was taken to the Jardin dcs Plantes in Paris. He was not]
so well treated there as at Rosa Bonheur's. A disease of the eyeai
made him blind. The artist who had used him for her superb study*]
went to see him. She was moved to find him stretched out in hlflfl
cage, humiliated and dying. [r.kfij.v
He could not see Rosa Bonheur, -but- he heard her. The cleat?
voice called "Nero" and the lion stood up, groped about in the dark-i
ness which surrounded him until his huge paw- found the hand oft
his mistress, which he held until death loosened the grasp.
Another beast, a lioness, died at the foot of the stair-way of tha'

The charm which protected Rosa Bonheur from beasts of the "fun-*!
gle seeemed'to lie in her eye. There, was somethmg courageous and]
mild In her regard which overpowered them. Those kindly gray eyes
had nothing of the fear, nor yet. the challenge of hatred so usual to
the' human eye when looking at ferocious 'animals. Rosa Bonheu&i
looked upon them as fellow creatures. j
It* Is said that she had. but little love for family life and that shaj
had never been attached to any one half as much as to her horses ami!
cattle. She never, married and no romance or love affair ever came to
the notice of the public. ' Â» â¢â 
But her forest studio was always frequented by a crowd of artists!
and men of affairs among whom she moved in her careless toilet and,*
nonchalant manner, chatting, smoking a cigarette and then returning-.]
to her work. She treated peer and pauper with like Btraight-forwartlr!
simplicity. .
Although seventy-seven when she died, she retained to the end]
her alertness and activity. The warm blood of the South ran In her
veins and the Parisian spirit rested. on her lips. Her face was pc-
culiarly attractive, pensive, , delicate and yet solid.
Her last painting, entitled "Vache et Taureau d'Auvergne/'was"
hung In the Paris Salon this year. Like all her other pictures it was'
the subject of much wonder.
'.'.-. Other animal painters, say the critics, surpass her, in color, com- i
position and even in correctness of drawing, but nowhere in the his- ;
tory of art is found such vigor and such knowledge of the animaL
which IB; more surprising a woman.
All are agreed . that "Vache : et Taureau . d'Auvergne," nalnted

\ Queen t/ictoria.
VS****-^ -ARTS, May J lO. c 15 99, â Well
I il Au"t Flora, Mabelle and I came
j PARIS, to Paris last, night from
Aunt Flora. Mabelle and I came
back to Pari* last night from
J .London, and I must tell you
.___ . about my trip.
I told you we were thinking
too much of it, but we did not know any- j
thing for sure, but Mr. White, the charge j
d'affaires, who is, or was, the momen- j
tary Embassador until the arrival of <
Mr. Choate, wrote us and asked if we
would like to come over for the first draw
ing-room. It was a chance not to be de-
spised, for no Americans or Australians
are ever accepted at the first by 'the
Queen, as she then receives the English
peerage. But the new Lord Chamberlain
made an exception In this instance. Mr.
White having boomed us considerably,
and we flew to London, all In a tremble
and a flurry.
Well, Wednesday dawned bright and
early, the first day of March coming In
not as usual, but like a lamb. I started
to get up and could not, for I was giddy
and sick. Poor Aunt Flora was ter
ribly frightened, and a doctor came,
stuffed me full of a lot of something, and
I arose. "Well. Bunko Bill (her pet
name for her father) "you would really
have been Impressed with your last at
tempt." for she was quite imposing in her
white satin gownâ white, with one
black bow on the shoulder, Just out of
courtesy to Victoria, as she is in mourn-
ing, -and so Is the court. My train was
seven and a half yards long, and I wore
a tulle veil with three Prince of Wales'
feathers in my hair, all of which is "de
rlgueur," you know. I carried a bunch of
lilies of the valley and wore all of Aunt
Flora's jewels that I could carry. My
gown was made by Mme. Ge.ber. and was
trimmed with white roses and lilies of the
valley. . The \ train was satin, like the
grown, and was fastened by a sort of fin-
ish of a collar, embroidered in silver. My
dress in the back was very decollete, and
my train was fastened to the edge of the
decolletage by Aunt Flora's diamond pin
and caught on one shoulder by her neck-
lace. So I played Vanderbilt for three
hours. ....
Now for a description of Mabelle. You
would' have been dazzled could you have
i seen her. for she was queenly. Worth
made her gown, and it was very, very
beautiful. The train was trimmed with
orchids. Oh. I forgot to say that my
train was all beruffled inside with Chan-
tilly lace. Mabelle had no trimming at
all on her gown, and the satin was a lit-
tle stiff, but she carried it off beautifully-
just as though she had been born In it.
Well, we were ready at last, and Aunt
Flora went with us In the carriageâ a
usual court carriageâ with coachman and
footman in red cloth, powdered wig. short
trousers and black slippers. The foot
man wore lilies of the valley and orchids
mixed, and so did the coachman. The
two; white horses had big pompons of
white ribbon at -heir ears, and the
â¢ harness ! was all "white. â¢ ' .;. ':'â 
'â  | As Mabelle and I ; came out of the hotel
there was a -crowd standing, in the street
and around the' red carpet, which spread
to the carriage.' We really felt like royal
ty. "We started for Buckingham Palace,
following a long, line of carriages exactly
like ours. When we reached the entrance
we drove under' a great red canopy,
fringed with gold and held up by eight
men, and Into the courtyard where the
Queen'- hand was playing. Of .course.
Aunt Flora did not get out, but we
descended, helped by our footman, and
passed a line on cither side of her
Majesty's Officers of the Guard, who
shrieked .out one to the other:
â¢ "The Honorable Miss Swift!" and like-
wise my name.
My! but it does give you a funny feel
ing. It almost seems as though It were
the first time you had ever heard it.

other ladies into a large room, which Is
the chapel and which is arranged witu
seats in tiers. An oiHrrer stepped forward
and offered me his arm. Horrors! He was
over six feet, but he caught hold of me
and led me to my seat forward, likewise
Mabelle. Yqu see, that was because all tiie
ladies that were presented attend, court
every year and so had their own seats or
those belonging to a cousin, mother, etc.
We sat there twenty minutes and then
passed into the next room and so on
through four rooms. . . â -,â,, "...
At the end of each room was a sort of
golden gate, guarded by four officers, they
allowing only twelve ladles to pass It at
a time.
Well, I could tell you miles of the
beauty of the rooms we passed through,
but I'll wait until I Bee you. We Anally
reached the Galerle dcs laces, mado
something like the one over here, except
\ that it was only one. mirror. Here we went
single file, and the gentlemen In waiting
examined â¢ our toilettes, measured our
trains, spread them out,. etc.
The Marquis of Lome stood next to me
! and escorted me to the door, and I said to
j him In a most English voice:
"Pardon, your Grace, but how many
j royalties are there present?"
He seeing that I was not English and
taking It for granted that I was either
: myself or Mabelle said, "Her Majesty Is
: sorry not to meet you, Miss â cr â erâ
â¢ "Murphy," I said.
'.. "But she Is not attending court." And
j then he told me there- were six royal
i present, meaning, of course, that I had
| six bows to make. Sly dog! Of course
he .was- only joking, but he was. fanny
and quite broke up my dignity.,
All this time I/had been walking toward
; the door of the throneroom, and as I
reached It I met- the Lord Chamberlain,
who is a young man, and he led me by the
; hand to right in front . of the Princess
Christian, the Queen's daughter; then he
shouted out as though every one was

beauty, uausTifme.J^ugeia
A SWEET expression has so much
to do with the beauty of a face,
it seems a pity that women do
not cultivate this more assidu
ously, for it's largely a matter
of cultivation. I assure you.
Cheeerfulness and amiability will redeem
many a face of almost hopeless irregu
larity of feature.
Even though a woman possess the clas
sic lineaments of a Greek goddess, she
could not be a beauty with a mouth that
is forever drooping at the corners, brows
that insist upon tying themselves into
ugly, fretty little knots, and eyes thai
eternally shift from one object to another
with in utter lack of interest in or toler
ance for whatever subject happens to be
under discussion.
It is the girl with the jolly, happy ex
pression that pleases, whom we look at
the longest and with the greatest satis
faction; just as it is the young woman
with the fretful, sour visage that we turn
from to the more Interesting study of
wall paper advertisements. <
no. spend some of your spare time culti
vating a sweet expression. Don't make
of your face a limpid stream wherein are
reflected all the passing cares and wor
ries that disturb and harass the mind.
Don't let such minor worries as a mis
placed bow on a spring bonnet or a
sleeve that will skew lay you out with
nervous prostration, but brace up and
make the best of it. Tnings can't always
go Just as we would wish, as most sensible
women know; so even if you are a bit
tired and wearied with all the rest of it,
be plucky and of stout heart Just the
same. "Smile and look pleasant." as the
photographers say, even if you don't feel
that way.
Believe me. it Is more than half the bat
tle, for gloom of countenance Is the worst
enemy to the charm of a pretty face.
Sweetness and amiability are as "'"catch
ing" as the chickenpox.
Although most of us have blessings
enough to keep us continually sending up
a prayer of thanksgiving, **ew of us rea
lize It, more's the pity. Our troubles
seem as big to us as the almighty hills,
while the good things of life appear to
be no larger than a tiny little molehill.
It's a pretty nice old world, after all. and
remember this, all you who idly fancy
that your burden is the heaviestâ there
never yet was any one in this world so
badly off but that some one could be
found who was more so.
And while you are remembering bear
It in mind also that fretting and worrying
and crossing bridges will hasten the com
ing of the crow's feet, which all the mas
page and laving on of cold cream in the
world will then be powerless to chase
away.
Doesn't It seem foolish, when you stop
and think, that half the fretting that we
indulge ln, anyway is inspired by our
Imaginations over things that we fear
may happen and which, as a matter of
fact, never see the light of day?
The mind, after all. is at the root of
most physical Ills, and to a certain "ex
tent the fountain of eternal youth is with
in ourselves. Cheerfulness and a merry
heart will do more than medicines toward
beautifying the face and retarding the
approach of those horrors of the whole
pctticoated race known as wrinkles.

For the benefit of the many who have
asked for tho formula for cucumber milk
I will print it again to-day where all may
see it:
Cucumber fink.
Oil of sweet almonds, 2 ounces.
Fresh cucumber Juice, 10 ounces.
Powdered white castile soap, % ounce.
Essence of cucumbers, 3 ounces.'
Simple tincture of benzoin, 38 drops.
Buy the ordinary cucumbers now sold
in the shops. Cut up in small pieces,
neither peeling nor removing the seeds,
end pour on just enough water to start
them to cooking. When cooked soft and
mushy, strain through a piece of muslin.
The essence you can make yourself by
taking one and a half ounces of alcohol
and one and a half ounces of the boiled
cucumber juice. Add to this your castile
soap, and let it stand until the soap has
entirely dissolved. Then put in the cu
umber Juice. Shake well, so that all are
Mioroughly mixed. Then add the oil of
pweet almonds and the benzoin,' stirring
for some time. Put in a bottle and be
sure and shake well before using.
Apply It at night. Let it dry on the skin,
rinsing away in tepid water the following
morning. :-'â¢-.:

and is perfectly harmless.

Answers to Correspondents.
> MAYFLOWERâ As the growth of hair
on your face is so very fine I think I
should use a little peroxide of hydrogen
on It. Apply with a bit of absorbent cot
ton or a small sponge. After a few appli
cations the hairs will be so light ln color
as to be scarcely noticeable. I do not
happen to have personal knowledge of a
case of superfluous heir that has been
destroyed by the use of ammonia, but I
have it upon excellent authority that if
used persistently It will Anally deaden the
growth. I can tell you of no way of
lightening the hair save to blench it, and
if you experiment with anything of tbl3
sort yourself the result is liable to be dire
and dreadful, and besides, as the hair
grows out it will be the, natural color and
the roots will have to be touched up from
time to time. Dort't do it. You will lind
it a terrible nuisance, and it Is almost
certain Dot to look as well as the shade
that nature provided. Corn starch is per
fectly harmless as a face powder.
MISS Viol, a REEDâ Use the cucum
ber cream as you would any cream.
Cleanse your face thoroughly with tepid
water and castile soap, and after rinsing
in clear water dry and apply the cold
cream with the fingers, rubbing it well
Into the skin. Then with a soft cloth re
move oveiy vestige of grease. The erun-
tions on your face tell a straight story of
unwise eating, and all the blood tonic-, in
the world will do you no good until you
come into an understanding of correct
diet. Don't use hot water on your face,
and never use any soap but the purest
imported castile, I have given directions
many times since your letter was written
about removing moles. You must have
seen them.
NYDIAâ What I have just said to Viola
Reed is. I am sure, applicable to your
case. You must look to your diet If yon
would have a skin of unblemished loveli-
ness. Pin your faith to fruit and vege-
tables and lean broiled meats. Avoid
pastries and sweets, also rich and greasy
foods. Keep your face thoroughly clean
with the complexion brush, and use the
orange flower skin food religlouslv every
night of your life. The pumice stone will
remove the miniature mustache only ter
n and if commenced will have to
be continued for all time. Why not bleach
It with the peroxide of hydrogen? Your
hair has probably been Injured by using
too hot an iron. Suppose you give it a
rest from the crimping iron for a few
months. Be sure that all the split ends
are kept clipped, brush It carefully each
day and shampoo it every two or three
weeks with the yolks of two eggs beaten
to a froth and added to an ounce of rose-
mary spirits and one pint of warm water.
Rinse carefully in several waters. Wind-
ing the hair around the little curling kids
will wave it prettily without in any way
injuring It. Possibly you have scrubbed
your face too much and too hard. Any
treatment that Irritates the skin will do
It more harm than good. There is no
need of using both the cucumber cold
cream and the skin food, as they each
answer the same purpose. In using the
lemon juice apply it to the skin, and after
it has dried on use the skin food. A little
peroxide of hydrogen will whiten the neck
nlcelv. It will also benefit the eruptions-
on the back and arms. Massaging (ho
neck each night with lanolin will add" to
its plumpness. .
ABIGAIL-My dear little girl, you need
not have been in such a flurry because of
J"3- S__*?Â°T__.__- Instead of thinking you a
bad little girl, as you fear. I am thinking
that you must be the nicest kind of a
little girl. I hope that you will write to
me often and tell me just as many of
your little worries as you feel inclined.
I m everybody policeman, you know
I cannot understand why, if your cold
cream was made according to directions
and of pure materials, it should ' have
caused your face to look dark and un-
cleanly the next day. There must have
been something wrong about It. Yes, you
can add a few drops of benzoin to the
cream very nicely. By thick, sweet cream
I mean such as Is used on the table for
coffee, etc. I think the cold cream will
be better for your skin, unless you -find
that you cannot use it at all, In which
case you might try the sweet cream. You
need have no fear In using the baking
powder and the other powder that I sug
gested for the perspiring hands.
NELLâ I should prefer not to recom
mend any such wash as you wish. Am
sorry, but . such experiments are rarely
ever successful. Sage tea will have a
slightly darkening effect upon the hair.
By trying It on a sample of hair you can
see for yourself just what shade it will
give. '
GEO.- Believe me, I am more than
sorry not to have been able to send
you a personal reply, as you asked, but
were I to grant all such requests the
days would not be long enough for me
to accomplish the one-half of all that I
have to do. The only way to get rid of
the blackheads is to go after them every
night with a complexion brush of good
firm bristles, tepid water, and castile
soap. If the blackheads are very bad add
a little alcohol to the water. Be sure and
follow the scrubbing with a smearing of
cold cream. An occasional steaming will
also hasten the -departure of . the little
pests. If this ' treatment does not help
you, write to ma - again and I** will give

Forty-eight grains resorcln; one-fourth

GLADYS WALLAS-Try this healing
lotion on the red and irritated nose:
Three drops of carbolic acid to four
ounces of rosewater. This is excellent
for a red nose that Is caused by Inflam
mation of the skin. Touch the center of
each wart lightly with a lunar caustic
pencil once a day, being very careful not
to get the caustic on any other part of
the skin. The warts will turn black and
gradually disappear.
DUENNAâ Many, many thanks.
ANXIOUS G. M.â The complexion brush
that I recommend is made of firm white
bristles. I prefer it to any other. It is
much more searching than the rubber
brush and therefore more cleansing.
There is only one wholesome wav of re-
ducing flesh and that is by rigid dieting
and proper exercise. Avoid fattening and
farinaceous foods, such as rice, potatoes
turnips and beets. Drink plenty of lem
onade and mineral waters; shun sweets-
never sleep more than seven hours and
exercise every spare moment. Eat spar-
ingly of butter, drink little coffee and no
milk.
DAISY WESLEYâ The hair tonic given
in lore-going reply to Mrs. J. XV. will help
you. I am sure. Touching the eyelashes
with castor oil will Increase their growth
moistened salt is also good. The little red
spots com.- from various causes They are

Try bathing them In a little diluted lls-
ttrlne. I know nothing of either of the
soaps that you mention. I do not care for
medicated soaps and prefer the pure
white castile to any other for the face
TRIALSâ It is much wiser not to meddle
with any sort of blemish in the near
neighborhood of the eye. Frequently little
red lumps like sties appear on the eye
lid. These consist of a small sac filled
-with a gelatinous substance. The only
cure for them Is to have them cut and the
contents of the sac removed. Bathing the
eyes with boraclc acid may relieve the
redness of the lids. The bagglness may
come from weakness ct the eves, but it is
more often a sign of -internal trouble
usually the kidneys. â¢ Red hands are some
times caused by tight sleeves or a too
snugly laced corset. The best way to
whiten them is to use lemon juice, apply
ing cold cream as soon as the Juice Is dry.
STORY OF ONE WOMAN'S LIFE.
ONE winter, long ago, I boarded
with a little womanâ l mean liter-
erally littleâ who was one of the
most perfect housekeepers " I ever
knew. Her house was small, so
there was nothing to prevent her "going
through It" every day. Her husband was
an invalid, but a more shining invalid
one could never find. Such dinners as we
had; such suppers as were served to us
day after day; such breakfasts as we got
up to. I wonder that any of us survived
to tell the tale. She washed. Ironed and
scrubbed every Monday; she churned,
worked butter and baked every Tuesday;
she worked over butter, scruooed and
darned every Wednesday; she went eight
miles to town every Thursday; on Friday
everything underwent a general cleaning
up, and she churned again; Saturday
there was baking and getting ready for
Sunday, and Sunday there was the In
evitable "company" to eat and praise,
and Monday it all began over again.
Besides all this, she milked four cows,
raised 200 or 800 chickens each year, did
the family sewing, and could boast that
"each of her two daughters had sixteen
quilts apiece, all ready for the bed."
She could neither read nor write; her
daughters followed . closely in her foot
steps. A. better woman never lived, and
even in her matter-of-fact life there was
a longing for mora beautiful -things. It

M. â Resorcin is an antiseptic and is
used as an active ingredient in many hair
tonics. Druggists usually keep It. Please
read letter to Anxious G. M. for informa
tion about reducing flesh. Lanolin and
cocoanut oil are both hair producers in
their pure state, but there is such a small
quantity of each in the skin food that I
think there is little danger of its causing
hair to grow on the face. However, if
there is an excessive tendency to a downy
growth I would advise a cream that con
tains neither of these Ingredients.

she always had an abundance growing In
her garden, and where in caring for them
she could combine pleasure with duty.
Her feet long since ceased to keep time
to the clock; she sleeps sweetly.
She went away not an old woman, but
when she should have reaped the harvest
for which she had sown. .The husband
of her youth found time, during his en

to her some of the long-suppressed and

hard work, and that friend who some

his brave spirit, and the little wife, with
shoulders bent Just a little more, re

Oh. If there had only been a "friend
at court" who could have said to her In
the kindest manner: "You are only a
woman; you cannot do the work of "man
and beastâ and live. It is not living
merely to exist; don't cook, bake and

but a pathetic witness to the nervous,
ceaseless energy of an unnourished and
overburdened woman. The lingers that
pieced the intricate pattern and set the
dainty stitches so closely together were
knotted and tremulous with toil; the
hands that folded them so carefully and
unfolded them so proudly for brief in
spection were brown and hardened from
constant contact with outdoor work. If
only her beauty-loving soul could have
learned to know Itself; to have expended
its hungry energy upon books, pictures,
something for the eye to see and the
brain to feel while the hands were folded
Idly, in her lap! If that energy had been
turned upon the soil that needed It so
badlyâ her children, who inhabited
the house and, farm with herâ what a har
vest she might have reaped!
There is so much beauty and loveli
ness in our lives, as we can live them
on the farm, if we only find them. The
beauty of comradeship, of heart-to-heart
association, freedom from conventionali
ties, the hearty, healthy outdoor life and
closely allied Interest with nature, which
is our greatest teacher and friend. If
the . men and women only have time to
know! There lies the greatest drawback
to perfectly appointed lives and homes in
the country; the lack in our belief of that
God-given commodityâ time. And until
we realize that time is eternity we will
always be skimping along trying to live,
and all that the word Implies, without

There is a perfect rage for these
"shawl" gowns, said the girl who has
Just returned from Paris. Then she took
two or three out of her trunk aad showed
them to me. They brought forth an "ah"
of admiration. But if they were good to
look upon in the hand they were surpass-
ingly beautiful on the figure.
The "shawl" gown Is just exactly what
its name signifies. Not material made in
a shawl-like .pattern, but a real shawl
made into a gown, fringe and all. Scis
sors are used very sparingly on these
shawls. It is not necessary to cut into
them much for the drape effect. They
look as though they had been wound
around the wearer and yet there is plenty
of room to move freely.
One gorgeous "shawl" gown 'intended
for a house gown was made of a black
crape Chinese shawl covered with bril
liantly soft embroidered I flowers, which
the Chinese so artfully execute.
Another one, to be used as a dinner
gown, was of ..white, entirely covered with
heavy raised white embroidery, the long
white silk fringe coming up the front of
the skirt and then falling away on either
side and outlining the bottom of the
gown.
The third one was a delicate combina
tion of gray and pink, so arranged as to
give a princesse effect and suitable for a
reception gown. ,
These "shawl" gowns were by far the
most novel and beautiful of all the cos-
tumes which this devotee of fashion
brought with her from Paris.
So, if you are fortunate enough to pos
sess a shawl which Is large enough for
the purpose procure some of Bernhardt's
pictures taken in these gowns and have
a modiste who Is an artist copy them
for you They are graceful and "artistic
without being bizarre. Nor have they the
falling to pieces" effect which one would
imagine. ""..'â¢
A word of warning! Unless you pos
sess a figure almost as slender as that of
,Dlvâ¢ Sarah, though you have the most
beautiful shawl of the Indies, do not at-
tempt the "shawl gown." The result will
be unhappy. .-â¢-i., â¢_.,â¢

HODO GETS HIS BLOOD UP
(Copyright, 1899, by Joel Chandler Harris.)
OLD Bcar-Ftce would have had quite a shivery feeling If he had
known that the wailing cry he heard was the voice of Mr. Collings-
worth's Music, telling the rest of the hounds that she had discov
ered the drag of a fox. Although Joe Maxwell, with Buster John
behind him, and Hodo trotting in a dignified way at his horse's
heels, had gone directly into the public road by way of the spite
near the spring, the rest of the huntsmen, led by the White-Haired
Master, went through the ginhouse lot. The dogs, delighted to be free once
more, and enthusiastic over the prospect of a chase, went galloping about
the place, nosing in every corner; not because they expected to find the
scent of a fox thereabouts' hut because it is their nature.
It fell to the lot of Music to pass near the spot where Old Scar-Face
had caught the hen the night before. A few feathers were lying scattered
about. These Music investigated and Immediately her nose made an im
portant discovery. A fox had passed that way! Whereupon she lifted up
her voice to warn the whole pack. Some responded, while others thought
it was a piece of folly, and went trotting along about their business. But
Music persisted.
Mr. Collingsworth stopped his horse and listened. "That's a fox as
Mr. Collingsworth stopped his horss and listened. "That's a fox as
sure as the world," said he.
"Pooh!" cried Mr. Dennis contemptuously; "you've been training your
dogs with a cat skin. Call the silly creature off, or you will have all tho
dogs going .it full cry after a neighborhood meat."
Just then Mr. Dennis' Ruth put In: "What did 1 tell you?" ho insisted.
"Tf there's a fox within a radius of five miles this chase of a tomcat will
scare him out of the country."
"Wait!" said Mr. KJlpatrick; "I hear Whalebone trying to whimper,
and I know mighty well he's not Interested In cats."
The rain had taken a good deal of the snap out of the drag. .Toe Max
well explained to Buster John afterward, but the hounds knew their busi
ness. They flung themselves about trying to hit upon a fresher scent, but
finally worked back to the ginhouse, from tho ginhouse to the road, and
along' the road to the bars. They worked very quietly. Music's warning
wails had not been repeated, but she, as well as the rest, knuckled down
to business, working with occasional whines and half-barks.
Joe Maxwell and. Buster John had already arrived at the bars that
opened into the sedge field. When Hodo saw that all the rest of the hounds
were coming ln his direction, he lost his dignity so far as to examine the
ground near 1 he bars.
"if that fox was fool enough to go down to the barn during the night
he's fool enough to stay in this field until he heard Music bark awhile ago.
If that's so, he'll never run ahead of the dogs any more." This was Joo
Maxwell's conclusion.
Old Fountain, somewhat belated (for his going had not been decided on
till the last moment), came galloping up. riding, a mule, dismounted and
flung down the bars. Somehow M seemed to Buster John that, flinging
down the bars had brought daylight, for. as the last one fell, he looked
about him. and everything was plainly visible. He could see the rest of
the hunters coming along the lane that led from the ginhouse lot, and he
could see Hodo cantering rapidly toward the pine thicket, where he had

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JUNE 11, 1899.
"When he's up, where does he run?" Joe Maxwell asked Fountain.
'Straight to'rds de pint er woods 'cross yander, an' den he bars ter de
lef, allers ter de V."
At this Instant Hodo gave a fierce challenge, to which Joe Maxwell re
sponded with a cheerful halloo that brought all the dogs into the field
with their heads up. The clouds had now blown away from the east, and
the level beams of the rising sun fell upon the tops of the pines.
"Name er de Lord! Look at dat dog!" exclaimed Old Fountain. Hodo
had issued from the clump of pines and was now leaping in the air above
the level of the sedge and running wildly about. The rest, of the dogs were
even more excited. They ran around, giving tongue and acting as if the
ox was right under their noses. But Hodo suddenly ceased nis antics,
challenged twice, and was away, followed by the whole pack, their voices
rhyming and chiming in the crisp morning air. Involuntarily Buster John
squeezed Joe Maxwell as hard as he could. He was deliriously happy.
He felt a pang, however, when he saw the rest of the hunters gallop
ing helter-skelter after the dogs, while he and Joe Maxwell were ambling
along in a direction "that seemed gradually to lead away from them. But
terfly, however, was running toward a hill in which the sedge field cul
minated, and from this point a wide expanse of country lay under the eye.
Joe Maxwell looked at his watch and found that only five minutes had
parsed since Hodo had led the hunt away from the clump of pines near
which Old Scar-Face made his home. The young man gave Butterfly his
head, and in a few moments had reached the top of the hill, which, though
not high, was the highest point for many miles. The sun. shining at their
backs, threw a flood of yellow light on the hunt. Buster John could see
his grandfather, tall and straight, riding after the hounds, flanked on
either side by the rest of the huntsmen, while Old Fountain brought up the
rear, belaboring his mount with a brush broken from some convenient tree.
The dogs could be heard, but they were not In sight. They were run
ning through the point of woods to which Old Fountain had referred.
"While Buster John was looking at the hunters Joe Maxwell ran his eye
along the horizon to the left and caught sight of the fox going as swiftly
as the shadow of a flying bird. He tried to show this swiftly-moving
shadow to Buster John, and finally succeeded; and then it vanished.
"Great goodness!" exclaimed Maxwell, gleefully: "he must have stopped
to catch a rat. What is he thinking about? He won't last forty minutes."
"Why. he's a mile or more ahead of the dogs," said Buster John.
"A mile and a quarter," admitted Maxwell, measuring the distance with
his eye. "Wait 'till 1 send word to Hodo." ..- â  _
Prompt as an echo a black shadow hurled Itself from the woods, and
went careering across the open country. Joe Maxwell raised himself In
his stirrups, placed both hands to his mouth, and uttered three, short.
sharp, shrill yells that cut through the air like a whip lash. Hodo an
swered with a roar, and seemed to grow smaller. Certainly he Increased
his speed. The rest of the dogs, headed. by Whalebone, Ruth and Music,
were by this time well out of the woods, and the hunters, who were not
far away, cheered them on. They were running beautifully, and Joe Max
well could afford to say so. .
"They'll not be far away when the end comes," he remarked. "And if
that old fox has any grit- in him, he'll Vie caught somewhere between this
hill and the point of woods the dogs came out of."
"Why, he's running away from here," cried Buster John.

"Of course," said Joe Maxwell, "and before many minutes have passed
he'll discover that he can't play the old game. Of course. if this isn't tbo
old fox we're after we'll never see the dogs catch him. They'll be coming
back presently, and we'll have to see If there's any hair between their
teeth. If it is the old fox he'll run away till he hears Hodo close at hand,
and then he'll get scared and try to reach Home again."
"The rest are following the dogs," said Buster John, ruefully, as he
saw them galloping In the sunlight. -
"And you are sorry you're not with 'em," suggested Joe Maxwell.
"Well, they'll see no more of the race than we have seen, even if we're
after the wrong fox. If we are after the right one we'll probably have him
ready for their inspection by the time they get back. But we're not going
to stand here," he said, reassuringly. "We are going to gallop over there
and be ready to put Hodo right at his heels when he comes back."
This they did. In fact, as Butterfly was chafing at the bit, Joe Maxwell
let him have his head on the firm Bermuda turf, and he went flying along
in a way that thrilled Buster John. A mile of this sort of traveling was
enough to satisfy Butterfly's ambition for awhile, and he was willing to
stand quietly when his rider finally drew rein.
The dogs could be heard running far away, their voices borne back on
the morning breeze like the echoes of melodious complainings. Joe Maxwell
looked at his watch again. The hunt had been going on twenty minutes.
"That's the right fox," said the young fellow, "and he's pretty game,
or he would have made his double before this."
Finally the dogs wont out of hearing altogether, and Buster John took
advantage of that fact to follow with his finger on Maxwell's leg the entire
outline of the triple loop by means of which Old Scar-Face had been in the
habit of throwing his pursuers off.
"If he bad had an hour's start," said Maxwell, "this would have been
a pretty performance, but he's had his work cut out for him this morning.
Maybe he was making one of his loops beyond the point of woods yonder.
Yes, sir! That's just what he was up to! The dogs came out of the woods
not twenty-live yards from where they went in."
"Suppose the dogs have caught him?" suggested Buster John, who was
all for action.
"No; they're coming back." replied Maxwell.
"I don't hear them," said Buster John.
"Nor I," Maxwell- admitted; "but Butterfly does."
And sure enough the thin and sensitive ears of the horse pointed for
ward, and he. was listening Intently. Presently â¢ a murmuring, singing
sound was heard, like the humming of bees. It grew louder by degrees,
and seemed to be coming nearer and nearer.
"He's due here pretty soon, if he's on schedule time," said Joe Max
well, in a low voice. "Keep perfectly Still. Don't move. I want you to
see how Hodo manages this sort of thing."
As the dogs topped a distant hill their voices sounded like a clash of
cymbals, with full brass band accompaniment. They seemed to be nearer
than they really were.
"Yonder be comes," said Buster John, under his breath. He had his
hand on Joe Maxwell's arm, and he indicated the position of Old Scar-
Face with his thumb.
The old fox was running bravely. He showed none of the usual symp
toms of defeat or even fatigue. His brush was well up, and he was going
very nimbly and rapidly. He soon disappeared, and the music of the pack
died away as the dogs descended into the depression below the hill. Then
came the sharp, eager cry of Hodo, close at hand. The watchers saw him
come over a fence 100 yards away, like a bird, and he ran toward them
with head up and tall down. Evidently his blood was up.
He swept by some distance from the point where the fox had passed
and Buster John declared that he was not on the track at all. Joe Max
well made no reply, but gave to Hodo the signal which told the dog that
the fox was not far away. Again, as before, the dog Increased his speed,
bearing closer to the drag, and this time Joe Maxwell, with Buster John
behind him. rode rapidly In a parallel direction.
"I give him five more minutes," said Hodo's master; "but he's certainly
a game old fox." :v-s: .--. -
Faster and faster went Butterfly for several hundred yards, and then
suddenly drew rein. The valley before them afforded a plain view, except
for a ditch which ran through the middle. The dampness there had at
tracted a growth of alders, brambles and such weeds and shrubbery as
thrive where the ground is wet. On either side of this ditch there was a
clear space of Bermuda turf, dotted here and there with small pine
brushes. On the further side of the ditch Hodo was running. Suddenly Tie
turned, crossed' the ditch and came flying back, while Joe Maxwell rode,
toward him as fast as. Butterfly could go. Again Hodo crossed the ditch.
and as he did so Old Scar-Face came out on the opposite side and went
careering across the open field. In a series of wild yells Joe Maxwell gava
Hodo the view halloo, and in another moment the dog had been across the,
ditch again and had Old Scar-Face in plain view.
It is safe to say that never in the course of his life will Buster John
ever experience such ssnsations as he then had, or behold such another
home, but care, for show. Will be more
outdoors than Indoors. Will grow witty,
pretty and attractive and will always be
in company. The company you keep

Last Monday night Aurora Lodge, in rec

the officers during the past term, re-elect
ed them all to their several stations ex
cept the guardian and the captain of the
guard, the incumbents declining further
honors. , .This lodge , has made arrange
ments for an open meeting to Its members
and their friends on the 19th Inst In its
lodge room in Union Square Hall.' There
will be a fine programme and there will
also be a cakewalk. :
The address that was delivered by Mrs
Jennie Nussbaum, protector of Martha
Lodge, on the occasion of the presentation
to that body of a beautiful silk American
flag for having during the term made a
most wonderful advance in membership
was a very patriotic and eloquent expres
sion of feeling, and during the course of
her remarks she said that "the lodge will
display the beautiful, beloved and honored
stars and stripes at every one of Its meet
ings and cherish It as a trophy of a con
test won by friends from friends in their
commendable effort to advance our great
order.""
Last night grand and past grand officers
together with a number of the members
of the local lodges, went to Vallejo to
present Marion Lodge, which is the "baby
lodge," its charter, received: a few days
since, and at the same time present Mrs
Marion G. Perry a handsome jewel in rec
spectacle as was there enacted before his eyes. He could only vaguely^ re
member that he heard the cry of dogs behind him. and that .the i voice of
Hodo sounded like a deep and continuous murmur. Within the course of
fifty yards the dog overran the fox and turned and caught him befoie Old
Scar-Face could get himself under way again. **_,- ,_.
And the funny part of it was that all tne other dogs were up in time to
"â¢ive the dead fox a good shaking before he got cola. ... i_Â»ii_-._ .>,-, %
"When the hunters came up Mr. Collingsworth pretended to Relieve that J
Music had killed the fox, and Buster John was astonished to see that Joe
Maxwell lined nothing for Hodo. Mr. Denis insisted that Rowan or
Ruth was th" guilty party, while Mr. Kilpatrlck declared that if killing
foxes was a hanging crime, he wouldn't give a thrip for Whalebone s life.
These remarks were jokes, some of them as old as the men that made
thorn But Buster John didn't know that. Â. ,
" V- v the other dogs were not in sight when Hodo and the fox came
into the field, and they didn't come up till the fox was caught and killed,
TldsJsurtemenrtte^eemed to make no impression on the others. "Aber
crombie make the boy tell you to-night how much Maxwell gave him to
talk that way,"' remarked Mi. Collingsworth. -.'J Â Â«.â_._* .
tal Seeing that Buster John's feelings were hurt Joe Maxwell turned to
him laugning '-They're only joking," he explained. "They know very well
that their dogs would never have caught this fox. â  . â :.- .Â»,
"Why Hodo was running him all around here like a rabbit before the
rest Of the dogs were in sight, and before they did get in sight he had
ldll-1 ffive^oul." e?rlldSMrr.JChollingsworth. "That dog of yours is a

In this matter Old Fountain's judgment was as good as the best. Hodo
had no forbears to account for his phenomenal gifts of nose and head and
speed, and he left no posterity to succeed. He stands alone among fox
hounds, unique and incomparable. .

Continued on Page Thirty-Two.The very desirable Lambardi opera
singers, ho seem to have sprung up
out of nowhere in particular, just that
wo might have the chance to make
marvelous and self-satisfying "discov
eries," are the notables of the past
week theatrical. Especially to the
critics have the Lambardis been a big
boon. They have supplied the matter
for positive statements, and a critic is
never so glad as when he can tell his
public facts that are largo and lncon-
testible. There is nothing vague about
this unpressagented little band of
Milanese warblers. What they can do
they do with cheerful enthusiasm, and
what, they can't do goes in much the
same way. Their orchestra, for in-
stance, would trouble the deaf; their
chorus is violently unlovely to look at
and not particularly sweet to hear, and
in their productions I notice a general
absence of the good stage manners that
have come to be yarded as an es
sential part of a modern opera per-
formance. But tho principals, who are
many, can sing, and in that the organ-
ization wins. You find yourself uncon
sciously making excuses for the short-
comings while you bathe in the de-
lights of ii.'- actual accomplishments.

seriously presented, is always worth
serious attention. It is said that Mr. I
Miller hopes to make this company a |
permanent stock affair in San Fran
cisco. We need something of the kind,
need it badly, for we are far behind in
the new plays, most of which are in the
hands of Mr. Frohman. This is a
Frohman company, and that means
much. Among the players is Edward
J. Morgan, who was a fine young actor
when we saw him several seasons ago.
Since then he has Increased in reputa
tion, ambition, and, from all accounts,
in art. The American stage is rich In
clever young women, but it needs
clever young men. Mr. Morgan's
season here, which will be of consider
able length, will doubtless bo valuable
experience for him as well as for us.
The piece for to-morrow night's open
ing is Henry Arthur Jones' "The
Liars," which is described as a comedy
of manners. We are told that it deals
in the polite fabrications of a
number of polite people, some of whom
are in love, others not, but all actively
are in love, others not, but all actively
interested in the affairs of those who
int. rested in the affairs of those who

The story of "The Liars," in the main,
tells of the infatuation of. Falkner, a
young African traveler, for Lady Jessica,
"who is married to a middle-aged man,
Gilbert Nepean. She encourages Falkner.
Her friends are interested in protecting
her from possible scandal, and an Impor
tant factor In this work is Sir Christopher
Deering. Lady Jessica tells Falkner that
she is to visit her aunt In the suburbs of
London. As she has frequently, she says,
mistaken the path, she may find hersell

"Turtle" at the California.
"The Turtle" will be seen for the first
time In this city at the California Theater
to-night. This much discussed French
farce had a two years' run in Paris, a 200
nights' run in New York and is still oc
cupying the boards in Berlin and Vienna.
Whatever may be said of the morals of
the play. It is conceded that it has been
dignified by splendid acting and artistic
treatment in every way. It is said to
have one of the funniest third acts seen
on the stage in years. This audacious
farce, for it can be classed under no other
heading, Is perhaps the most widely dis
cussed play in the country.

lack of plausibility, and It is understood
that the author rather resented this be
cause, as a matter of fact, she had his
torical authority for her incidents, and
had made careful study, extending over
three years, of the period. Of course
neither her labor nor her accuracy had
anything to do with the matter. Truth,
we all know, may be stranger than fic
tion, and fiction is just as likely to be
more plausible than absolute truth when
seen across the footlights. It is the old
distinction between realism and reality.
There has been a recent discussion of this
subject in Paris in relation to a drama
entitled "La Belle Madame Hessel'.n." by
M. Edouard Gallfor. In reply to a charge
of improbability brought against him the
author indignantly retorted that he had
placed upon the stage, without altering
the slightest . detail, "un morceau de
renlite, un . tranche de vie," and that the
critics who had fallen foul of him in this
respect were consequently altogether in
the wrong. Whereupon the critics fell
upon him again in a body, and it is hoped
that he has been converted from the error
of his views.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW IRK, June 10.â Yesterday's notable
rise In prices of stock. brought the expected !
result in large orders to commission houses by j
wire an.l mail to buy stocks. These were put
In at the opening and executed at the high
prices to which values were marked. The pro- I
fesslonal operators who have been buying j
stocks in the last few days met this demand !
with sales to realize. After this trading had
beet concluded it looked as though the large !
operators who â â¢â - started to bo. stocks in
the last few days were Indisposed to pursue j
their activities, and the market began to sag j
on light transactions. The low point was made
Just before tie- publication of the bank state- j
ment when prices in many cases were below '
last night's level. American Steel and Wire, j
Sugar and Atchison preferred, St. Louis.
Southwestern preferred, Brooklyn Transit ana i
Manhattan were the severest sufferers from
the reaction. The experts had figures that the
bank statement would Show a decrease of
$5,000.C00 in cash holdings, although it was
known that only $1,500, 000 of the week's gold
shipments wan figured in the statement The
losses of the banks to the Sub-Treasury were
expected to be heavy. Instead of this, there
was a decrease in cash of less than a million
and a half, and the liberal expansion in loans
of over 110,000,000 was evidence of the easier
feeling if bankers over the outlook for money.
Prices of stocks hardened _,â a consequence
and recovered most of the earlier decline.
Sugar touched the top price for the day and
Consolidated Gas rose about s'_ points. Perm-
sylvania was consistently strong throughout on
a selection of a new president, and St. Paul
enjoyed the benefit of Its Increase of $1*; 000
ln gross earnings for the first week in June.
The bull leaders are undoubtedly counting on
the favqrable effect to be produced by- coming
reports of railroad earnings which for the next
few weeks will compare with the period last
year â¢â¢â hen the Letter wheat deal had Its
recompense, the price of wheat suddenly
dropped and the movement of grain, and con-
sequently th- earnings of railroads, had the
only notable setback of the year. As the grain
roads have been making excellent compari
sons, even with the period of the maximum
grain movement last -ear, the Increase for the
next few weeks are expected to be phenomenally
large. 'ii;.. bull movement sought to be in
augurated yesterday In American Steel and
Wire proved abortive, and the stuck failed to
rally trom its weakness to-day.
S^gar was comparatively quiet, but resisted
all attempts to force it down. The selling for
London account because of the Transvaal crisis
was Ignored. The powerful bear party whose
efforts to get prices down last week were
partly frustrated renewed their attack at the
â¢beginning of this week. There was great con
fidence manifest, in lhÂ» short selling of Sugar
and when on the afternoon of Wednesday the
announcement .- i- made that the regular
quarterly dividend of - >r cent bad been de
clared .m.l there was a simultaneous advance
ln the price of refined sugar to the trade which
was acquiesced in by rival refining interests
the bears had not a leg to stand on. The recov
ery In the price of Susar corresponded in vio
lence with the decline which had been forced
on "tii*- and rumors that the trade was to be
one of extermination, and that It was only a
question of time when it would necessitate a
suspension of dividends in order to see it to
a finish tin th- same day came the declaration
of a semi-annual dividend of 11, per cent on the
preferred stock of the Atchison, Topeka and
-"nnta Pc Railroad. This was a quarter per
cent more than the last dividend, it came out
of the earnings of the fiscal year en. ling June
3" next, and was accompanied by a statement
from the directors that enough would remain
out of the earnings for that period after provid
ing for all previous charges after setting aside
a ".'reasonable sum" for a reserve to supply
another similar dividend in January next. The
bear party was .very voluble In assertions that
11 was -i question whether the dividend on
Atchison preferred could be maintained at all,
owing to tlie failure of crops in the company's
territory. Predictions had been current in Wall
street that the preferred stock will I*- selling
1* points below its present level. This alleged
.condition of Atchison affairs played a large
part in the plan of campaign of the bean. The
refutation of it and the changed aspect of the
speculative outlook for Sugar undermined their
position so seriously that they became alarmed
and rushed to cover. The Atchison dividend
and other favorable developments also, brought
some outside demand for stocks through com-
mission houses Of these developments the
most potent was the continued large earnings
shown by current returns, from railroads of
every group and from all sections of the coun-
try.
There has grown up a more confident and
cheerful â¢ feeling regarding the coming crops-.
Damage to winter wheat. It la alleged, will be
offset by the spring wheat crop ami by the
heavy corn crop and the increased interior re-
ceipts of wheat Indicate large reserve in farm
ers' hands for which the damage to the Rus
sian crop will help to provide a good mar
ket Money is obviously abundant, and no con-
tingency Is now foreseen which can make' it
scarce. The outgoing gold movement is in it
self an evidence of the plethoric condition of
money, for it is certain that when the crops
begin to go abroad there will grow up a
trade balance In our favor again. If money
was scarce the gold would be held in form of
sterling loans until the return tide, thus sav
ing the expense of bullion transportation. It
is generally understood that the . gold was
drawn by special inducements offered by the !
Bank of England, ln the desire to replenish Its i
reserve, and by the Russian Institutions. The j
inducements are in effect a premium on the
gold. Nevertheless It is quite evident that no
widespread public interest has yet been awak- |
ened in the stock market such as is relied upon
by operations with large capital to relieve them
at a profit of what they buy. The distrust of
new industries and the old ones. too. is due
to the hesitation more than anything else. The
conviction that promoters have paid heavy
prices for the constituent members of the com
bination, and that most of them have been
heavily overcapitalized, even supposing the
original prices paid for the properties had
been reasonable. . As a result, the more re
cent flotations have been made with some
difficulty, and the Issues are not readily ab
sorbed. This is markedly true of the numer- -
ous new steel issues, notwithstanding the un
precedentedly prosperous conditions in that ;
trade.
In the bond market there has been some
Increased activity In the latter part of the
week, and an improvement in prices.

ASSOCIATED RANKS' STATEMENT.
NEW YORK, June 10.â Financier says:
The statement of averages of the New York
Clearing-house banks ending June 10 is much
letter than was expected. The known move
ments of money for the week Indicated a reduc
tion in cash of about (5,000,000, and this, coupled
with the expansion known to have been made
in loans and deposits, seemed to forecast a
heavy reduction in reserves. ..The- statement/
however, shows a decrease ln surplus cash of
only 13,287,-00, to a loss of $1,445,000 In specie
and the additional requirements originating In
the deposit Increase of 17,770,000. The surplus
reserve now stands at over $3., 000,000, which,
discounting expected gold shipments and larger
loan commitments, Is an assurance of a con
tinued ease in money rates. The exhibit of
the week implies a shifting of funds as much
an anything else. â¢ One bank which has been
prominent in the export movement reports a
loss of between (8,000,000 and 19,000.000 In de-
posits and in gold, but tilts had been counter
acted by the operations of other Institutions.
The loan expansion Is due in part to the. re
vival of activity on the Stock Exchange and
the greater portion .of the gain has been made
by four or five banks. It is difficult to deter-
mine what part current gold exports play In
the totals of the week, as the averages are
somewhat misleading in This' respect. There
! seems little likelihood, however, that the ex
port movement will be checked by padded
money alone. Our remittance. It Is true, has
fallen off and domestic exchange is quoted at
a discount, as against a rather steady premium
this spring, but the July dividend period will
bring money in this directicn. The. low quo
tations on call have suffered some on New
England borrowing in tills center and Stock Ex
change requirements are heavier. Still, even
with this drain and with the probability of
further exports of specie now and the crop de
mand later In the season, nobody anticipates
anything like a hard money market over the
, summer, and It Is conceded that the available
: currency supply will be augmented by gold
i imports in the fall.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
[ CHICAGO, June 10. For a few minutes
around the opening wheat showed strength.
Cables were firmer than expected, and a little
buying when little wheat was on the market
held prices Arm. July start. at 74%Â©74% c, an
advance of %c over yesterday's close. Lib-
eral receipts here and in the Northwest end
favorable weather In the spring wheat coun-
try brought out considerable wheat and in-
creased the number of short sellers, and a
decline to 74% c took place before 10 o'clock. 1
Then the market generally grew strong. Mich- 1
igan State crop report, putting the condition j
at onl> 45 per cent and ettimatlng the crop
at 12,000,000 bushels, compared with 34,000,000
bushels last year, cheeked liquidation. Later
reports; of drought damage to Russian and
Roumanian crops came In. One feature of the
trading which had considerable Influence on
local speculators was the heavy buying by si.
Louts, which started when the price was well
under "puts" an.l which was kept up -nearly
all day. The market, which had apparently
been oversold, advanced rapidly during th.
last half hour's trading. July advanced un-
der heavy general buying to 75%075%c and
closed firm at 7": â¢ . â 
Corn was weak early, but rallied later. July
closed firm and a shade higher.
Olts were steady. The strength of wheat
was apparently the chief factor. July closed
unchanged.
Provisions were dull and heavy. Packers
were sellers. Strength of grain had a steady-

THE STOCK MARKET.
Local securities were quiet, the only active
stock being Gas and Electric at $67 62%*. 6*.
Mining stocks were firmer and several showed
a slight advance. The telegram from the
pump said: "The elevator is running con-
tinuously. The water is 231 feet below the j
1750-foot level, 36 feet below the 1950-foot level |
and 257 feet below the Sutro drain boxes.
A large stream is still flowing from the 1950- j
foot level into the shaft. This morning all :
work through the C. and C. shaft has been j
suspended until repairs on the main hoisting I
engine are finished, which we expect will be i
in two or three days. The elevator will be
run regularly and the water kept below the
1950-foot level, ,Â»he work looked after through j
the Sutro tunnel."
On account of improvements at the mine and |
mill, the Pennsylvania Mining Company of '
Grass Valley did not declare a dividend this
month.
The Mexican assessment of 10 cents per share
will be delinquent in the company's office to-
morrow.
At the annual me.ting of the Crown Point
Mining Company the old board of directors
was re-elected, composed of C. L. McCoy
Thomas Anderson, J. P. Martin. E. Gauthler
and James Newlands Jr. C. L. McCoy was
re-elected president, Thomas Anderson vice
president, James Newlands Sr. secretary and
\\ . E. Sharon superintendent.

An Old Play Bill.
j
j
.
An old playbill of the Kilkenny Theater
Royal for May *14, 1793. has been found.
This playbill is reprinted in the Western
Mall and the following is an extract from
it:
"The tragedy of 'Hamlet,' originally
written and composed-by the celebrated
Dan Hayes of Limerick, and inserted in
Shakespeare's works."
The playbill Concludes with the interest
ing notice that " no person whatsoever
will be admitted into the boxes without
shoes or stockings." It is probable that
this Irish claimant to the honor of thi.
authorship of "Hamlet" is not so well
known as his . astounding claim might
warrant. â and Queries.

or confidence, I took the hand, which was sun-browned and berry-

With that he lay down upon the green turf that bordered the path-
way with emerald and placed one little shell-like ear close to the
opened eschscholtzia, or California poppy, that shone in a firmament
of green like a golden star from the blue sky above us.
"Shi" said he. "It is striking thirteen. Come down here and hear
for yourself." 1 lay down beside him and really heard, coming seem-
ingly from the heart of the poppy Bower, the sound of faint, fine
chiming. Seeing the puzzled look on my face my little friend laughed
merrily. The little people of Nidderdinks Land will think that you
are funny enough when I lead you to them. You must not question
so. but believe. That is the way to be happy. In Nidderdinks Land
you will have to believe everything that you see and hear."
"Nidderdinks Land?â and pray, where may that queer place, or
that place with a queer name, really be?"
"Come." It was he who held out the inviting hand again. I let
him lead me and on we fared. A moth miller came and rested on his
curly head; a bird sang to him on a thorn bush and would not move

THE FIRST BUSINESS SUCCESS
OF LITTLE DOTTY AND DIMPLE
By Marguerite Legarde, San Francisco.
D OTTOS and Dimple were two
little sisters. They were not
twins, though if you saw them
you. would think they were.
These two little sisters lived on
a farm, four miles from the neighbors,
nnd seldom saw any one outside of the
family. The farm had a - reek running
through it and many people from the
city, passing there, would stop and
take a drink.
Dottie and Dimple were very bashful,
so they would hide behind a tree and
watch the people go to the creek.
One day the hired man, Jim, asked
their father why he did not put up a
lunch and sell It to the people, but he
said 'No," hut Dottie and Dimple, were
present and thought of a plan that
kept them awake half of the night.
The next morning both dressed hur
riedly and rushed downstairs to lay
their plan before papa mamma and
Jim. They wanted to make corn balls
and put a table out near the creek and
sell the corn balls to the people who
came there.
Mamma said at first that it would
take too much molasses, but she con-
sented when she looked at the eager
faces of her two little girls. They were
very happy children and Jim added to
their happiness by promising to make
a table for them, which he did. The
table was put out near the creek. The
sisters then made some corn balls and
placed them On the table and Jim put
up an awning over the table so that
the sun would not shine upon the pop
corn.
Then the little girls put up a sign
that reads like this:
-
I
Corn balls, two cents apiece; I
Corn balls, two cents apiece;
sugar, one cent.
Please help yourselves and put
the money or the table.
The first four days many people
came, and after they had gone away
the little girls came out of their hid
ing place and saw half of the corn balls
had been taken away, and they took
the money and placed it in mamma's
tin bank. Some days many persons
came and some days none at all came,
but the bank in mamma's drawer be
came heavy. Two or three days run
ning no one came, for it 'was already
October and the people had gone back
to the city.
.-.. the sisters opened the bank and
it contained four dollars. One dollar
would pay for tin- molasses, but the

WAP walking along a shady lane,
thinking of you, my dear children, and
wishing that you all yes, every one
were really mine, when something very
queer happened. Listen and then think
if thai was not queer. A creek was
singing gently as it went on its pleas
ant way under the shadows of the trees
â singing dreamily, softly. Just where
my pathway turned I found a little
boy lying asleep. A crackling twig
ma.!.- him open his big blue eyes.
"What is your name?" he asked of me.
Now it was not polite in me not to an
swer, but I was bo surprised to And a
little stranger there, and asleep, that
my question, that had already been
formed when he awoke, crossed his on
the way. It was: "What is your
name, my little lad?" We both laughed
and neither answered. With the sweet
girls had three whole dollars for them
selves. What a fortune they thought
it. But they had heard of little girls
in Chicago who had not any dollars, so
they decided to send *he money to
them.
Every year they made more money
and spent it in a useful way.

THE EXTREMELY ODD STORY OF THE ROUND MOON.
ONE evening as the stars were
twinkling in the sky like dia
monds the Moon came down to
where I sat. she told me. that
in fair weather she always
dressed in blue, which was very be
"A Mare?" I asked; "is that your name?"
"Yes," was the answer. "How do you like it?"
Three fuzzy bear cubs came tumbling along the path, more roll
ing than walking. With a glad growl of recognition they ran to
and surrounded Aldare and licked his hands and face.
"The acorns are ripening, Aldare," said one.
"And the wild bees are filling the old honey tree with fine honey,"
said the second. â¢-;
"Vis, and the hills are Just black with blackberries," so said the.
third. ,
"Go, then," said Aldare, "and bring me an acorn, a comb of
honey and a blackberry, that I may have money to pay to the ferry
man, the lodgekeepej and to give to the. Queen."
These three having been brought, Aldare put them carefully in
a little basket that he carried, and we trudged on.
We came to a lake that I had never seen before. A very funny
and very small old man was standing beside the lake.
"Take me, please, said Aldare, "to Nidderdinks Land."
"You forget, Aldare, that no strangers can be admitted to Nid
derdinks Land." As he said this the ferryman looked at me.
"No. I know* that is so, but the Queen has ruled that an account
of Nidderdinks Land may be written. My friend goes in to-day to
coming to her. With her brilliant set
of diamonds sparkling in her blue
dress she looks like a que. But her
face was- very rod, it looked like a
ball of fire and was always radiant
with humor and laughter.
Th.- Moon told me a great many
stories, but the oddest of all was this:
Once as she was traveling over the
City of Spindles she heard two men
talking. They said that they were
going down to the Merrlmac River.
She traveled on with them until trey
came to the river, where they stopped.
The men got into a boat and started
out on the river. . As the Moon went
on her way her shadow passed along
the water and one of the men said to

the other:
"Say, Pat, what is that ball of green
cheese In the water?"
"1 do not know-." said Pat.
" We'll. I'll tell you, Pat; I will hold

"('nine, then," said the old man; "but have you an acorn to pay

"Greedy old ferryman," said Aldare, laughing, "of course I have
"Greedy old ferryman," Said Aldare, laughing, "of course I have
an acorn for you. And what do you think?"
"What?" asked the old man.
"I was asleep by a brook to-day. and while I slept I had a dream
that I was in Nidderdinks Land and there was a tree growing in a
shady dell. I looked, and lo! it was an oak, filled with acorns, so full
that the branches were bent down close to the ground. Then I said:
'Here is what my old friend, the ferryman, would like.' With that
the tree made me a bow and gave me a sign that it wished to do me
a favor because, when there was a freshet last year and the oaks by
the creek were likely to lose all the acorns that they had dropped
upon the ground to take root, I coaxed the grizzly bear to dig up
the ground with his sharp claws and plant -the acorns. Since then
all the oak trees have been my friends. So I told the oak tree that
bowed tO me that 1 wished that it might be growing by the ferry.
All things come true, you know, in Nidderdinks Land. When you
come back from ferrying us over the lake that tree will
be here growing and its acorns will be for you. Only, I beg you,
that you will plant some acorns every day,, that there may soon be
a grove here. Then there will be a company of sister and brother
oaks, who will be glad together."
The ferryman gave his promise to plant the acorns daily. But
where was the boat in which We were to travel to Nidderdinks Land?
I had noticed that there were many squirrels near the ferry landing.
At a signal by the ferryman all the squirrels went to work to make
a ferryboat. Time is of no value there and a new* ferryboat has to
be built for each passenger, the old boat being always destroyed
at the end of a voyage. It is not very hard work to make that sort
of a ferryboat Some of the squirrels dragged with their teeth,
strips of bark that had been on the trees to the lake's edge, Others
pulled up bullrushes and tied them together with cords. With these
cords the pieces of bark were sewed by the squirrels. Thus a flat
boat or raft was made. :-â¢.â¢;..-'.
- ..hoard," said the ferryman.
The squirrels went on first and squatted down,' with their tails
raised. Did you ever see how squirrels sail across a- stream? They
get pieces of bark, raise their tails so that the wind will blow on
tie as if they were sails. Then away they go. And so, away went
we, In the self-same way that all squirrels go.
The ferryman had only to find the breeze to blow in the right
get it." said the first speaker.
So overboard the man went and
grasped at the ball of green cheese.
Bui the hall was out of his reach, and
the other man seeing the ball move so
quickly back and forth, was fright
en- â â ! and let go of his comrade's legs,
and, of course, he sank.
Th.- Moon asked me if I would not
like to go around the world with her.
and I told her I would. So she came
down a little closer to the earth and
picked me up. .:..' \
As we rode around the world I saw
a great many strange- sights. As we
went over the ocean I saw a large ship
on fire. And as we passed through
the city of London I saw two large
houses burn down and a little boy run
over by a car. Then as we passed over
the ocean again we saw great birds
which looked like tiny specks hover
ing about the ships. The ships did not
look as large as I was. Great mon
sters swam about in the ocean, and I
was frightened lest I should fall. But
the good "id Moon, my companion,
said: "Do not be afraid, my little las
sie, you will not fall."
As we passed the earth again I was
frightened to Bee the people all run
ning about and the Moon told me that
I was too heavy and that he was com
ing nearer the earth and she was afraid
she would burn It up.
So she just politely said: "Good-by,
my little lass, come and see me again."
And with that she threw me down and
I felt myself falling, falling, and my

in hand. It was her chief delight to sit
on a rock and read for hours at a
time. Sometimes the rocks would be
almost surrounded by the water before
she would leave.
So. when Emily reached the beach.
she chose a rock farther out than usual
and then sat down to read. After a
time she heard a queer noise, and look
ing up, she saw. to' her astonishment,
that water was all around her. Look
ing down, she saw a sea lion beating
against her rock. Emily screamed and
frightened the animal, which swam
away. Emily had to wade, knee deep
to the shore. She was kept busy the
next few days telling of her strange
adventure.

A REAL LITTLE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.
RALPH AND HELEN SHERIDAN of Oakland are brother and sister.
Tiny claim an. equal share of ownership in a fox terrier, and the, dog,
who is happy in the love of them both, returns their affection most
loyally. . The following story is told: ' The children had gone away
for the summer. Doggie had to be left behind. Doggie was lonely.
A fine bed was prepared to soothe doggie's grief and the choicest supper
was made ready. Dog nature seems, to he much like human nature in
one particular. Grief did not spoil the dog's appetite Put when night
came, the time of sleep and loneliness, doggie's grief grew deeper. The
nice bed was discarded. Doggie went to a closet and there found a little
coat that Ralph had worn. Doggie pulled down the coat and would sleep
on that and on nothing else. On this precious keepsake the night was
passed and, no doubt, the faithful and longing canine heart was consoled
somewhat. The picture shows Ralph and Helen,, who have so thoroughly
won the love of their pet. ._.;'.;.' TM â />â¢â¢-_;- :

direction. .He had the winds bottled and every bottle was marked
with' the sort â¢ of .wind that.it held in. Thus there were bottles of
north wind, of south wind, of east wind and of west wind. You do
not. believe that? Well, you mustâ for anything and everything that
you see; in Nidderdinks Land is true. You will neve** be able to un
derstand about that country if you do not believe everything.
The old ferryman got hold of a bottle of east wind, which was
wrong. When he pulled the cork from the bottle the wind blew us
toward the shore and rolled three little squirrels overboard, as they
were looking for the breeze to come from the west.
"Dear me," said the ferryman. "I do believe that my eyes are
failing me. Look at this bottle, Aldare, and see if it is the right one."
Aldare found a bottle of west wind. That was opened and the
wind blew steadily in the right direction until we bad crossed the
lake and drew close to the shore of Nidderdinks Land. The ferry
man pulled with his oars a little and we were up to the landing. I
will have to tell you in another chapter how we fared in that country.
We bade good-by to the ferryman. He opened a bottle of east wind
which he pointed at the sails â that is, the squirrels raised tails and
then he was off. Aldare stood on the bank shore of Nidderdinks
Land and waved adieu until the ferryman had crossed the lake. Then
he led me to the lodgekeeper's house, for the lodgekeeper was to con
duct us to the Queen.
"Have you a honeycomb, Aldare?" asked a voice within the lodge
keeper's house. ---'>'.:â¢ ',-'â¢'..;./'
"That have I." answered Aldare cheerfully, "and I have also a
blackberry picked by a grizzly hear cub for the Queen."
"It is good," answered the keeper of the lodge. "Honey is for
me, who am none too sweet; the blackberry is for the Queen, and
often she has asked for you and wondered when you would bring her
favorite fruit. You will be very welcome. Enter freely."
So we went in through the gateway of Nidderdinks Land.

Sensational Life
OF
Princess Cfiimay
Continued from Put,''* Twenty-five.
had exploded In Austria. The heir ap
parent to the throne was shot. The usual
gagging of the Continental press ensued.
The facte- were never published. There
were gossips who, not knowing De Chl
may. attributed the shooting to him. But
there were others who did know him. and
presently it was related that the heir
apparent was shot, not by a jealous hus
band, but by a jealous King. After that
1 if Chlmay took his wife to Paris.
Two children came to the house of Chi
roay but so far as the Princess was con
cerned they were mere punctuation marks
iti tho vlvtcl story sho had begun to make
of her life in the French capital. Her mar
velous beauty, her magnificent, wicked
e> es, her marble skin and superb figure
that we* the envy of the gay. beautiful
women of Paris made adventure an easy
possibility.
The spirits of the Princess romped on
February 21, 1894, the anniversary of her
twenty-first birthday. She gave a grand
dinner and ball in Paris in honor of the
event. Her startling beauty and the lav
ish gifts which nature had bestowed upon
her made her the Idol of the h^ir of her
class.
Meanwhile her subtle nature was seek
ing: for relief from the fashionable world.
She wandered among: the cafes of Paris
Incognito, trying to placate her whims. It
was a hunt for happiness. Her nature had
not found It In wealth and titles-. It was
the strange affinity of contrast that drew
her.
Then she met Rigo. She fastened her
fancy on the Hungarian gypsy, who had
nothing that she had except the keen
spirit of adventure and the love of song.
These were the only ties that soldered the
fate of the Princess of Chimay and Cara
man and the musical Tzlgano. She heard
him play one night in one of the Parisian
cafes. He was tall and well proportioned.
H< played with skill all the romantic mel
odies of his nomadic tare.
Home, husband and children were not
forsaken on the minute, but finally her
acquaintance with the minstrel became
everybody's talk. Rigo, like herself, was
married, and to a woman of his race and
Fame wild, warm nature. If the Princess
Chimay's was a mad infatuation, the
wife's was a frenzy, and in time it burned
away her reason. Her importunities to
Rign became unbearable to him. and to
escape them he and his Princess fled.
With flare of trumpets they eloped to
Budapest, Hungary, where the life they
led soon brought them under the eye of
the authorities. Rigo's wife followed
them there, and in one of the hotels of
the capital one day her mind I gave way
completely and she was led out to confine
ment in one of the hospitals for the in
sane, where she has lately died.
The Prince of Chlmay did not pursue
his wife. He remained quietly at home
and the Paris courts soon provided him
with papers In divorce, which the Prin
cess did not contest. On the contrary,
the orgies in which her immense wealtn
enabled her and her Rigo to indulge be
came the broader and more abandoned.
From one capital in Europe they went
to another, staying not long in one place.
for the police drove them out. At times
the Princess would appear with Rigo at
one cafe or another, and finally she de
cided that they both should make the
stage their profession. It was but
another vagary of her diseased brain,
but it appealed to Rigo. and they
finally departed for Cairo, and from there
went to Alexandria, where she rented one
of the handsomest villas in the country.
There they decided to stop for a time
and begin their stage career.

E. B. Treat. & Co., the New York publishers,
have Just issued a new book on the "Sexual
Instinct, Its Use and Dangers as Affecting
Heredity and Morals'' Dr. James Foster
Scott, an authority in this field, is the author.
The matter is thoroughly and scientifically
treated, so that the lay mind may fully under
stand the topics discussed. In the introduc
tion the author justifies the writing of ii by
proving conclusively the importance of the
subject as bearing upon the proper education
of our youth. If there be any hope for the
moral betterment of the race it must come

the proper hands its possibilities for doing good
are untold.
