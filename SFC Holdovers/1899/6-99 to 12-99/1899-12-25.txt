"The Embassador of England was received
in private audience by the Sultan yesterday.
The Embassador can)e to obtain the authoriza

LONDON. Dae 3.â Christmas mom-
Ir.g brings no fresh news from the
*<eat of war. While the position Is
J_^ somewhat In the nature of a dead-
lock, each â¢â c.mbatiir.t watching the |
other, to say that the military situation !
Is unchanged would perhaps be hardly \
correct. When opposing forces remain j
facing one another for any length of time >
rÂ«uÂ«Â« which mill ultimate f- !rad to vic
tory or defeat, advancement or retirement |
will b* all the while at work.
So 'ay by day General Buller at
Chtev* and General Methuen, on the
M<"Â»4dT River, are receiving reinforce
ments. On the other hand, the Boers are,
bnth on the Tugrla River and at Magers
fontein. continually extending and in- '
creasing the Ftrongth of their Intrench
metita
Neither tide probably will venture any I
Immolate forward movement. To-day '
there will in &Jl probability be a truce, i
formal or informal, between the two foes.
The Puke of Oonnaught has again suf- |
f*r*d disappointment. He repeated his j
former request to be allowed to go to the i
front, but the Government deemed it In- '
expedient to assent trÂ» the request. Hi-
Royal liljchnef-ft thereupon offered his iÂ«er- ,
vfoM to Lord setts as Maff officer, but :
while the latter was ready to avail hlm
hÂ»'\t nf *uch devoted co-operation the CJov- \
eminent felt bound to adhere to Us dccl- '
â¢lon.
Here In L#cndon thÂ» feeling as to the I
outlook Is very hopeful. I met yesterday
â  South African millionaire, who. when I â¢
faw him some time .-.: was very gloomy,
but Is now very cheerful. As to the causa ;
of the change he said:
"To my mind the Fituation In South :
Africa, has aitere<l entirely for thÂ«i bettor.
One man who has gone cut with lx>rd
Roberta Is a power In himself. I mtan i
Colonel Henderson, who wrote that stand- i
erd work upon Stonewall Jackson. He j
ha* madÂ« a study of th*- tactics of Jack- j
â en, which were pimply marvelous, anil |
his experiences in the Civil War of I
America will stand Roberts in good stead.
It Is the science of harassing the enemy's â 
communications with Irregular cavalry.
"England has paid very dearly In order
to know how to fight the Boers, but it is
felt in England to-day, amid all our re
verses, that the Boers are going to pay
very dearly for the'.r Christmas festivi
ties.
"What pleases those like myself, who
know the inner workings and ways of the
Boers. Is the sight of Dr. I^eyds throwing
out feelers to France. In that action we
fee direct signs of weakness. It shown
that the Boers have had enough and that
they are beginning to feel the stress of
war When I last saw you I looked upon
the situation In a very serious light and
was prepared to sell my large mining in
terests. To-day I would not sell a share.
"Another pirn of the beginning of the
end is General Cronje's eudden rudeness
to General Metheun. after a period of con
siderable politeness. From this It is ap
parent that thÂ« victory at the Boer* at
Ma^ersfonteln was of such a nature that
they would not like to have It repeated.
"There is not the slightest doubt but
that the Boer* IN tiring of tho war; that
grave dissensions exist between the
Transvaalers and thÂ«Â» Fr<*Â« Staters, due
to the former accusing the latter of cow
ardice; that Is many districts of both re
publics crops ar*Â» absolutely rotting, and
that a state of seml-starvatlon exists
throughout both countries.
"It is a fart that the Boers are horribly
6!* appointed with the war. but still more
dissatisfied with the attitude of England
nnd the lack of support by the opposition
party in this country; In the Initial part
of the war the B.oers felt certain that
they would win. and so they did. They
based all their hones on England giving
In. and by means of â  'jn!ck campaign
gaining something like their own terms.
"England's united attitude to-day has
completely disconcerted the Boers. In the
huge reinforcements which England Is
row sending out they see the very death
Mow of their ambitions. Taking thÂ© situa
tion all around It is much Improved.
Very shortly tl>* Boers will feel Great
Britain's might, and Dr. Leyds will have
quite a fresh proposal of peace."

ERIN'S SONS ORGANIZE

OMAHA. Dec. 24.â The Bee will say to
morrow: There Is Fomethlnp more than
a likelihood that the pro-Boer agitation,
now so general throuphout the I'nlted
States, will lead to the resuscitation of
the once celebrated organization amonff
Irish-Americans known as the Fenians,
which planned and executed an Invasion
of Canada In IW. out of hatred of Eng
land because of the imagi that for sev
eral hundred years had been inflicted upon
Ireland. Intimations have reached. Omaha
from other cities that an address railing
for a renewal of the Fenian organization
and the Olnn-na-Gael had been sent out
from this city to enthusiastic Irish-Ameri
cans In other places; but Inquiry amonÃ
prominent Irishmen failed to disclose the
identity of any persons who may have
pent out such an address. As far as could
be learned there are no organized
branches of the societies named in this
city, although there are some men in
Omaha who were proud of their member
ship in the Fenian organization.
Inquiry, however, did develop the fact
that there Is some sort of a secret move
ment on foot among the Irish enthusiasts
In this and neighboring cities which has
for its object some decisive steps of a
more belligerent .character toward Eng
land than a simple declaration of sym
pathy for the Boers far away in South
Africa. The movement here will be In

DEATH GARNERS NEW VICTIMS
ON THE HUNTINGTON ROAD
Two Persons Killed, Three Fatally Maimed and
Five Seriously Injured in a Rail
Disaster at Pomona.
POMONA, Dec. 24.â Amid a crunching I
of wheels, a splintering of wood
work, a hissing of steam and a gen
em] smashing of Iron, glass .nd j
rails, the Riverside accommodation
on the Southern Pacific Railroad In
this city, ran off the track at 6:30 this
evening. Two people were killed out- .
right, three will no doubt die before to
morrow morning and five more are seri- ,
ously injured. The train consisted of lo
comotive, baggage car and two passenger
cars. All tut the last passenger car Is
a complete wreck. The loss of property
is probably $20,000.
The train left Los Angeles at 5:30 with
both passenger cars full of people who
â¢ had been attending a baseball game in.
Los Angeles and others who were goTg
to spend Christmas with friends and rela
tives. Many carried packages of Christ
mas gifts. The train wen^ over Covlna
, branch, passed Lordsburg on time and
started southeast toward Pomona. There
ls < a heavy grade between Pomona and
Lordsburg and where the Covlna branch
meets the main track of the Southern Pa
cific route between Los Angeles and Yuma
â  there Is a sharp curve. This Is close to
Rebecca street In Pomona. The train
sped swiftly down the grade toward Po
mona. Just as the locomotive began to
round the curve It left the track and amid
the roar, crash of Iron and wood rolled
twenty feet to the side of the Hack. InÂ©
baggage car went smashing to the oppo
site side and lies there with bot
tom up and the roof torn away. The first
passenger car was even more completely
wrecked and lies with the wheels tern
1 away. sldo3 stove In, roof gone, and
scarcely one whole timber left In the
j wreck. It is wonderful that any one es
caped from It alive. The second passen-
I ger car left the track, but no one In It was
â  seriously h;>rt.
The accident occurred Just as the Pomo
na people were starting out to attend
Sunday and Christmas eve services. The
noise of the smashing and crashing was
heard a long distance away and every one
knew what it meant. In a very short time
hundreds of people gathered at the scene
of the wreck and in the early darkness
; the dead and Injured were taken from the
mass of broken iron and splintered tim
bers. Every doctor in Pomona was called
i and people ran to get conveyances for the
I dead and injured. James Coyle offered
1 Jhe use of his Pacific Hotel to any and all
ii 1 the wreck, and thither the bleeding
an.l maimed passengers were speei-ly
i taken.

There were many pitiful scenes at the.
scene of the disaster. Women rushed '
about frantically calling for tusbands and
children who were supposed to be among '
the dead and Injured. Some men and
women were pinned In cars by broken '
seats and shattered floor timbers so that i
they were 'earful they would not be res
cued alive. A dozen women were taken
out of the cars with bleeding faces and
clothes bedaubed with blood. From the I
wreck of the hissing locomotive Engineer '
David Johnson was taken out almost dead,
with gashes about hi;- scalp and his chest :
crushed. Fireman White of Redlands was
found beneath the wreck of the bpggago
car with his face so badly torn as to be
scarcely recognizable." He is at the Po- |
voured others and the vital functions be
gan to weaken. The organic poisons
thrown off readily In youth were believed
to remain In the system In old age, or. at
least, be less energetically ejected. The?*
poisoned the finer cells, while without ac
tion on those of conjunctive tissues. The â¢
| noble cells died, became the prey of
, other of plebeian cells, thus bringing
atrophy to the organ where the metamor-
p hosis occurred. Professor Metchnlkoff â 
has proved conclusively that the noble '
cells are not dead In organs atrophied by
senility.
"Moreover, they may be multiplied. If
assisted In' their struggle with plebeian
cells they contin- â  to live actively as in

1 means of affording this resistance, and

Conductor Fitzgerald, who escaped all

just as the locomotive began rounding the
curve. Other people say that the air

If It can be shown that the flour was

that that flour was a* clearly Uabl* to

This doctrine of continuous voyage was

NEW YORK. Dec. 25.-The World has
this from London: The London Morning
Post prints this (Christmas) morning the
following from Its military expert:
"What should be our thoughts this
Christmas day on the war in which our
nation engaged? British public men of
â  both parties have for many years lived
In an unreal world, where war as a strug
gle for existence In behalf of Just cause
had no existence. The consequence has
been that fighting services have not been
managed with a view to such a war. and i
the public now suspects the present gener- j
ate. : 01 politicians to be tainted with
untrueâ or. at least, carelessâ views of
! war and policy.
"The ease, then. Is that of a people In

back to their followers for guidance, thus ;
showing themselves unequal to their

Good Dinner at San Quentm.
SAN QUENTIN PRISON. Dec. 24.-In
former years it has been the custom for
the warden of the prison here to let out
thÂ« privilege of selling Christmas supplies
to a storekeeper. Warden Agulrro has
made a radical change this year and dis
pensed with the services of men who have
been reaping a golden harvest from the
convicts. Formerly tho Inmates of t.ie
prison who were blessed with a fat purse
could purchase whatever they might de
sire from the storekeeper. This year,
however, the system which brought grief
to the heart of many a poverty-stricKen
convict has been abolished and Warden
ARUlrre has made arrangements for a
Christmas dinner for the convicts equal
to that which will be nerved at his own
table. The men who have sold delicacies
at extortionate rates to wealthy prisoners
in former years naturally feel more or
less disgruntled, but the poor men who
were compelled to stand by and nee tnÂ»Jr
more fortunate fellow-convicts feast on
the good things of the land, while iÂ»icy
dined on prison fare thank the warden
from the bottom of their hearts.

road Ttack.
SAN RAFAEL. Dec. -Six hundred
turkeys, strung in a row. have caused the
local sleuths to exercise the gray matter
of their brains so Industriously that they
are already referring to the source of
their bewilderment as the "turkey mys
tery." The turkey; are there â several
hundred bis. fat fellows, all picked and
dressed and ready for cooking before
gratifying the palates of as many fami
lies: but whose they are. where they came
from, and why, are questions that Ga
bortau himself would be puzzled in trying
to answer.
The distance from the local depot of the
Donahue line to the new town bridge Is
nearly half a mile. When the first train
pulleo out for Tiluron this morning the
trainmen and passengers wore astonished,
shortly after lea vine the station, that the
route was lined with turkeys prepared for
the oven. The first turkey lay within 200
feet of the depot and the last a few feet
beyond the creek, about 600 or 600 in all.
The authorities were notified, but have
been baffled In thrlr effort to discover the
owner of the Christmas birds. They are
all healthy and fat. and no reason can be
found for thus throwing them away.
Everybody Is certain they were not there
last evening, and that Is about all of
which anybody l.Â« positive. The turkeys
must be worth at least $1000.

Regiment, under Colonel Rice, arrived at
Iloilo two weeks ago from the I'nited
States. An officer of the regiment said:
We at home knew that our troops were on
Pauay. hut we had the Impression they occu
pied the Island; that the Important coast town*

to see the American forces actually besieged

PROTEST AGAINST THE

Claims for Subsidies Against the

TON HOTEL. WASHINGTON. Dec. 24-
Through the British Government the
Eastern Extension Cable Company has
submitted claims for subsidies allowed In j
concessions granted by Spain and has pro
tested against the laying of cables In the
Philippines by the United States.
While sending the communications of
the company the British Government has
uniformly declined to support them diplo- j
matically, simply transmitting them to (
this Government. Deprived of govern
mental support, the company has been ,
trying to secure some recognition of Its I
concession by the United States, going so â¢
far as to accept and transmit free of i
charge all Government messages from
Manila to Hongkong. The Government
however. Informed the company that the
United States preferred to pay for every !
message sent. The Government has not j
paid any bills thus far due the company, i
but It Is stated that when they reach
1250,000 It will be wiser for the Government
to purchase the concession for about
$1,000,000. as It has the right to do under
the terms of the Spanish grant. It will
probably not be long before the United
States will be indebted to the company
In the sum of $250 .DU0. as Its charge Is 75
cents per word. This is three times as
great as that for messages between the
United States and Europe.
The claim for subsidies will certainly
not be granted by this Government. It is j

the tank at once. Cole having turned over cer
tain *wrurUleÂ» to him and Messrs. Clark and
Coolldgr assisting in guaranteeing Mr. Blge
low The Comptroller or the Currency directed
that Mr Cole should renlgn at oneÂ« a* presi
dent; that the whole mutter . Â»hould me laid
before the directors and thai I should at the
proper time report the fact* to the District At
torney. At this time M*-Â»srÂ». CoolldÂ«Â« and
Clark were each borrowing not more than
$100 000 of the bank, with plenty of Â«ecurtty.
and each had about ITS.OOO cash on d*poÂ»tt.
Mr. Bleelow owed not more than that and had
more than enough on deposit to pay bis loan.
On the following Monday Coolldge and Clark
gave Cole JSO.OOO. Cole added JI2O.WX) of his
own money and repaid *2Â«Â». of thÂ« $600,000.
The balance. $400,000 man repaid In three days
by the sal* of Cole Â»ecurltleÂ«, a part being
bought by Coolldge and Clark through their re
spective brokers.
The bank's assets were, thus bettered by
$600 000 in cash. About a month later the facts,
so fax as known, were laid before the full
board of directors, and further Investigation
bhowed that there were $300,000 more of checks
outstanding not on thÂ« books and that the
Indebtedness of the Uovell Arm* Company was
really much in excess of the amount shown
by thÂ« books and that Mr. Cole wa.i himself
personally the holder of nearly $500,000 of the
Lovell paper. There was also found an ap
parent overdraft of Squires amount to S'-i.
000 In addition to their regular loan, which It
nelf was In esoens of the $104,004 limit.
Mr. Cole admitted his responsibility for this
overdraft either to the bank or to the Squires,
and turned over to the bank his own securities.
Including the IÂ»vell pap*r owned by him to
eÂ«-oure the entire Indebtedness for which he
admitted responsibility.. This amounted to
nearly $1,000,000 and the securities turn.- i over,
at their then market value, were considerable
In excess of the amount.
The Â«ix directors and Messrs. CoolliiKe and
Clark then entered Into a written guarantee
that the securities nhould be sufficient to make
good the Cole Indebtedness. Mr. Stevens, who
was elected president November S. the direc
tors and Messrs Coolldge and Clark have since
then done everything In their power and made
great personal sacrifices 'to save thÂ» bank
from failure. â¢ . -
The bank's assets are better off to-day by
about $300,000 cash, over $L<XW.OCO of notes and
securities and the personal guarantee of there
gentlemen than It was at the time I brought
the condition of affairs to the attention of the
Comptroller. The connection of Cole with the
so-called copper Interests was not the cause
of the Globe National Bank's* failure,
but hi* connection with lhe*e companies had
provided him with security amounting in the
aggregate at the then market prices to nearly
$1.&00.u00. These *ecurttleÂ» were not In the bank
when I examined It. but were put up later by
Mr Cole to secure his Indebtedness.
I make this statement at this time to correct
the various rumors now In circulation as to the
failure of the Ulobe Hank. In Justice to Mr
Blgelow It may be stated that on September 14
he. was the largest individual depositor In the
bank, He also was the largest whÂ«,n lhÂ« bank
closed Its doors.

ADVERTISEMENTS;
INTENSE SUFFERING
FROM DYSPEPSIA AND STOMACH
TROUBLE.
Instantly Relieved and Permanently
Cured by Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets.
A New Discovery, but Not a Patent
Medicine.
Dr. Redwell relates an Interesting ac-
count of what he considers a remarkable
case of acute stomach trouble and chronic
dyspepsia by the use of the now discov-
ery. Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets.
He says: "The patient was a man who
had suffered, to my knowledge, for years
with dyspepsia. Everything he ate teemed
to sour and create gases in the stomach.
He had pains like rheumatism In the
back, shoulder blades and limbs, fullnesa
and distress after eating, poor appetite
and loss of flesh; the heart bÂ«camo affect-
ed, causing palpitation and sleeplessness
at night.
"I gave him powerful nerve tonics and
and blood remedies, but to no purpose.
As an experiment I finally bought a 50-
cent package of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tab-
lets at a drug store and gave them to him.
Almost immediate relief was given, and
after ho had used four boxes he wad to
all appearance* fully cured.
"There was no more ucldlty or sour
watery risings, no bloating after meals"
the appetite was vigorous and he has
gained between ID and 12 pounds In weight
of solid, healthy flesh.
"Although Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
are advertised and sold In drug ctores
yet I consider them a most valuable addi-
tion to any physician's line of -tiles
as they are perfectly harmless and can
bo given to chlldre/i or Invalids or In any
condition of the stomach with perfect
safety, being harmless and containing
nothing but fruit and vegetable essences
pure pepsin and Golden Seal.
"Without any question they* are the
safest, most effective cure for Indigestion
biliousness, constipation and all derange-
ments of the stomach, however slight or
severe."
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets axe made by
the F. A Stuart Co. of Marshall. Mich,
and are sold by druggists everywhere at
50 cents per package.

by prying the lock from the back door.
With a sledge hammer they knocked the

with a heavy hammer and chisel drove the
romninatlcn lock through the door. The
rr.oney drawers were then pried loose and
the entire contents of the safe carried

property of Postmaster Wilson's wife.
Many valuable papers. Including Insur

On account of the muddy condition of

I From statements obtained to-day it
j seems clear that the presence of gas
I quantities in the mine was perfectly well
1 known and that r.aked lights were used
for several days before the explosion, Ac
cording to creditable authority not a Â»aie
|ty lamp was used â¢ â¢'i the ml;. by the
working crews since last Tuesday morr
j ing. four dn>s before the explosion. Fire
I Hoss James Ratcliffe. whose duty it was !
' to look after the safety of the mine and '
| upon whose care and Intelligence the lives
; of the diggers depended in a large degree,
j told his Ftory. Ratcliffe has not yet re-
I ccvared from h:B narrow escape from
; death. The nrÂ© boss said:
"I believe that the explosion was caused
i by a sudden fa!" which occurred just be
| fore the explosion. I do no; believe that
j there was enough gas In the mine to be
| dangerous. As a matter of fact, the coal
I Itâ lf gives off little gas. but the gas i
; comes chleily from the roof of the pit.
; After the explosion I went into the ml.;e
j with Join*, the pit boss. I went from lie
: entrance of the main shaft toward the air
j thaft. one hundred and ilfty yaras away.
; tvtrytni.'.g was titled wuh after-damp
: ana tmoKt. Jones gave out in a few mm
utes and i dragged him to the bottom of

Katcltffe said the explosion must have
â  occurred within two or three hundred feet !
,of the main â¢bate He hay the mine mi '
â  weu supplied with air.
'â¢It wus awful." said the fire boss. "The I
, men were trapped thero like rats ami i
j there Is no hope that a slngue man Is!
alive. The two shafts were uisabled and
' there was no other exit. I have never
; *een a more terrMc mine explosion. Stone
stoppings two feet thick ana cemented to
: getnor were utterly destroyed. Not even
i particles of rock remained. The stone was
blown Into dust."
William Pastorios. a driver In the mine,
tells a sensational story. Pastorios, who
I has lived In Brownsville for many years
and is regarded as a man of intelligence,
says that Pit Boss Jones on last Tuesday
morning issued a general order that all
safety lamps might be dispensed with
and In their stead the miners were per- ]
mitted to use naked lights. Pastorios also
states that the lamps were unlocked, con
trary to regulation.
"The miners always prefer to use naked
lights," said Pastorios "whenever possl
| ble. as they give better light and are
more easily handled. I have been work*
ing here a couple of months and used a
: safety lamp until last Tuesday morning.
At that time mine safeties were in use !
by drivers ;Â«Jid others who were con
stantly moving about the mine, and. j
therefore, exposed to grerm-r risk than a
digger ''i J* room. Contrary to the min
ing regulations the safety naps in use
were in many eases unlocked. The safe
ties were provided by the company as
usual, nnd they fhoulrt be locked. so that
It Is Impossible for a miner to open them
while at work. My lamp was unlocked
and I frequently opened and closed it.
On Tuesday the pit boss l?sued an order ,
that the -n could use open lamps, ami
they, of course, discarded the safeties,
which made â <>. poorer light. About 100
yards from the bottom of the main shaft
there was a fall, which has been boarded
1 up and In which Â»n<Â» pas stood against the
roof. 1 think It was this gas which ex
1 ploded."
Superintendent Boyer. who lÂ« the stipe- :
rlor of Pit Hoss Jones, when told of Pas
torios' statement, said:
"1 know nothing of the order to dis
pense with safety lamps." He would make
no further statement.
Amnn? the men missing and known to
be dead In the mine are the following
Hungarians: Michael Pamhek. Andrew ;
Parahfk. brothers; Paul Liundls, Thomas |
Kueland nnd Andrew TourslskL
Mine Inspector James P.Hck. who has '
been In the mine almost constantly since i
last night, came out to-night and gave a
graphic account of Its condition. Inspec- j
tor Blick paid:
"At the bottom of the two shafts the 'â 
mine is a complete wreck. Only enough ;
debris has been removed to allow of tho
bodies being brought out. There are
more bodies in the mine, but how many '
cannot be determined. There are un- !
doubtedly a number of corpses under the
wreckage. The lo.wer parts of the mine
are flooded and the wat< r is rising, as
! the pumps are disabled. The pumps will
1 not run for a day or two. as the six-inch
pipes draining the mine have been twisted
and broken like roods. - penetrated to the
face of the mine to-day and saw the
! bodies th*-re, but the after-damp was

| Ing further will be done to remove the
I debris until the water has been pumped
out. None of the men can possibly be
nlive. It will require several days to clear
the Ine The bottom of It Is wrecked,
but the roof and shies are intact. There
Is no fire in the "line."
Rough but reverent hands carried th*
bodies of th*Â» victims when they reached
the top of the shaft to th*Â» temporary
morgue on the hillside, a hundred feet
away. Of one of the men. Peter Crosby,
but a portion of the trunk and the back
of tbe skull remained, and that was vir
tually but a cinder. He was Identified by
a shred of his shirt that had been blown
Into lis flesh. Of the twelve dead there
was but one that was not a hideous
vpectade! Among the men at the Bn /.
nell mine to-day were many who had been
at any other explosions, but never had
they seen such mangled, burned and dis
tort <h\ bodies. Di N. 11. Taylor. Coroner
of Fayetf County, arrived early In the
morning- from I'nlontown. He impaneled
a Jury, who viewed the bodies as they
were brought to thf surface. The Inquest
will bo held at Uniontown as soon as all

SUDDEN DEATH
OF MRS. DENSON
â¦
Stricken While on Her
Way to Church.
Pp*cJÂ«J D!Â«p*tch to ThÂ« Call.
SACRAMENTO. Dec. M.-Mrs. 8. C.
Denson, wife of the well-known San Fran
cisco attorney, died here this afternoon
at .3 o'clock as the result of a stroke of
apoplexy sustained at 10 o'clock this
morning. Mrs Denson had come up from
San Francisco to visit her daughter. Mrs.
D A. I.I: '.ley. and to Join In a family re
union at Christmas. Her death was whol
ly unexpected, and the shock has proved
a terrible blow to her family and friends,
of which latter there Is a wide circle here.
Mrs Denson was a sister of Chief Jus
tice William 11. JJeatty of tho Supremo
Court and of Mrs. George E. Bates, whose
husband Is a San Francisco attorney, and
of Mrs. O. P. Willis of Sacramento, lie
sides her husband. ex-Judge S. C Denson,
she leaves a son. Hal Denson, and two
daughters, Mrs. D. A. Llndley and Laura
Denson.
Mrs. Denson was on her way to church
with her little granddaughter. Mary
Llndley, when stricken, and she com
plained to the little girl of .â  pain In the
back of the head, and then, a.>- If having
a premonition of death, clasped the little
one more tightly by the hand and said:
"Mar?', you win not leave me, will you?"
She had scarcely uttered the words when
she swooned and fell to the sidewalk.
She was taken into a neighboring house
and a physician was soon at her side
Judge Denson and Mr. and Mrs. Llndley
were hastily summoned, and, with other
relatives, were with her when she died.
She did not regain consciousness from
the moment she was attacked. While vis
iting her sister in this city some time ago
Mrs. Denson suffered a similar stroke,
and It was believed that the next would
prove fatal.
Mrs. Denson was about 56 years of age.
The funeral will take place on Tuesday
from the home of her daughter, Mrs
Llndley.

About a year ago Thomas' wife com

WOOD'S SPEECH WAS
PLEASING TO CUBANS
Citizens of the Island Believe That
They Will in Time Be Given
Independence.
HAVANA. Dec. 24.â The events of the
last few days have had a great effect on
Cuban politics. The circumstances at
tending the arrival of General Wood and
the departure of General Brooke, taken
with the speech of the former at the fare
well banquet to the latter, in which the
Intentions of the United States Govern
ment were restated, have satisfied the
Cubans that Cuba will certainly be In
dependent within a reasonable time. More
than this, the arrival and public and pri
vate utterances of Horatio Rubens have
Increased the restful feeling that now ap
parently exists among all classes. Mr.
Rubens has, without doubt, considerable
Influence. Wherever he goes ho Is
cheered by the peon'Â«* Ins room at the
hotel Is thronged with Cuban officials
seeking an Interview, and altogether he Is
regarded somewhat in the light of an
oracle.
Every influence is being brought to bear
to stop the proceedings against the Cus
tom-house appraisers now under arrest on
charges of fraud. The Judges, the Su
premo Court, fiscal and many other Im
portant officials are related to the per
sons under suspicion. General Wood says
that If the appraisers are guilty they must
be punished, no matter who is hurt. If
the relationship to the Judges Is such as
to disqualify the latter from giving them
an impartial trial a Judsre or Judges from
some other province will be assigned to
try them. General Wood declares that if
the judges decline to perform their duties
they will be Impeached In Cuba. Just as
they would anywhere else.
The Partia. commenting on General
Wood's remarks at the farewell dinner
to General Brooke says:
' It was a most satisfactory speech, with
a .easing military simplicity. Obviously
the United States Government Intends to
fulfill the terms of the Joint resolution,
and General Wood Is the man selected as
the instrument for this task."

MONEY MARKET IN
BERLIN IS FIRM
Exports to America Are Brisk and
Consul General Mason Pre
dicts an Increase.
BERLIN*. Dec. 24.â advance In the
relchsbank rate to 7 per cent had a great
effect upon the securities market. Values
declined only moderately . There was
nothing In the nature of a panic, as occur
red In New York and London. Notwith
standing the fact that the advance In Lon
don exchange continued, reaching yester
day 4 pfennigs above the gold point, gold
exports have hitherto been but moderate.
The Berlin Joint Stock banks are doing
all In their power to prevent exports.
The continued rise In London exchange
is due to the. fact that New York has
sent large amounts of three-months money
bills here for discount, taking In return
London exchange. A further cause as
pigned Is the heavy purchases of American
I railway securities by Germany, payment
for which Is now due at London. These
! pharos are chiefly Canadian and Northern
' Pacific. Private account Is declining. Call
! money Is rising. The outlook for business
teems excellent excepting that of dear
! money. It Is impossible to raise money
â on mortgages, owing to the . decline In
house building, which is expected event
ually to react upon the Iron trade.
Western Germany's car shortage,
amounting to 5000 cars dally. Is obstruct
ing the coal trade. Nevertheless, the
bourse takes an optimistic: view of the
coal prospects. As a result of this coal
shares are firm. Exports to the United
States are brisk. United States Consul
General Mason predicts an increase of
$250,000 at the Berlin Consulate for this
quarter. Chemnitz manufacturers report
' heavy American orders and bright pros
, pects for yarns at rising prices.

LEO INAUGURATES
THE HOLY YEAR
Pope Officiates at an Impressive
Ceremony in St. Peter's
at Rome.
ROME, Dec. 24.â The Pope solemnly in
augurated the holy year by performing
the Impressive ceremony of opening
the holy door of St. Peter's at 11
o'clock this morning. The ceremony was
performed in the vestibule, which v.-as
handsomely decorated. In the presence of
the papal officers, the members of the dip
lomatic corps, loading representatives of
the Roman nobility and a number of es
pecially invited guests.
After donnlns the pontifical robes, the
Pope, borne on the Â»edla ge*tatorla and
escorted by the. papal guards, proceeded
with the cardinals and the court to the
Slstine chapel. In the Vatican palace,
whore were gathered representatives of
the Roman religious orders and clergy.
After a brief prayer before the holy iÂ«ac
rament a ff>w moments of solemn silence
followed, the Pope and the papal dig
nitaries In their state robes being grouped
before the door. Then the latter swung
back, and the officials of St. Peters laved
the threshold and the door posts with
holy water, while Leo opened t!ie psdlm,
"Juhllato Peo." which was taken up by
the ponttilcal choir.

FELT THE ICY
HAND OF DEATH
Sailors Barely Avoid a
Watery Grave.
SAUSALITO. Dec. 24.â Five sailors In
the employ of Uncle Sam aboard the rev
enue cutter Rush had an experience this
morning which they would not care to re
peat, even for the pleasure of telling
other "tars" In the service why they en-
Joyed Christmas of '99 with a fervor out
of the ordinary. Almost certain death
stared the sailor boys In the face for
what to them seemed an age, though In
reality it was only for a few minutes,
their rescue being effected In a dramatic
manner when there was hardly a second
to spare.
This morning the five men, with Boat
swain Smith In charge, took the steam
launch of the cutter and came to town for
the mail, the daily papers and supplies.
On their return the propeller became en
tangled in one of the buoys to which
yachts are moored, which had become
water-logged and sunk beneath the sur
face of the water. The propeller was
broken and the launch began to drift with
the tide. A small anchor was dropped,
but failed to catch, HthÂ»r because of its
light weight or because there was not
enough rope.
Signals of distress were blown and at
tracted the attention of those on board
the Hush, who saw that something was
wrong with the launch. Boats were hast
ily lowered and In five minutes two of
them, each manned by four men, were
racing for the launch, which had drifted
three-quarters of a mile toward Raccoon
Straits. A strong tide was sweeping in
through the heads, and it was easily seen
that If the boats were unable to reach
the launch In time it would be dashed to
pieces on the Jagged rocks lining Be â â¢ â  â¢
dere Point, where the tide rips around the
promontory with the speed of a mtllrace.
Owing to the depth of the bay at that
point, the Iclness of the water and the
fact that the rocks were slippery from
the spray, It was likely that the shock of
contact would stun the five men and make
their drowning almost a certainty.
Realizing this, the men In the two boats
bent to the oars as they never had before,
and with the tide In their favor the boats
fairly flew over the water. One got a
length the start of the other, and M close
was the contest that at the finish they
were nearly even. The launch was reached
and thrown a line when it was within
twenty feet of the rocks. Then the men
backed oars, and after a long, hard
struggle succeeded In towing the launch
into calmer water, where they stopped,
almost exhausted. In a few minutes they
resumed their work and towed the launch
back to the cutter. The feat was loudly
cheered by a hundred spectators who had
gathered on the wharf, many of thtm
watching the rescue through field glasses.

"Judging by expressions of prominent
men who came to St. Louis to talk over
the question," said the Judge, "the feeling
Is quite strong for the measure. It -vas
shown that two suits are now pending,
one from Michigan and the other from
Illinois, in which perhaps the same prin

which has been under discussion. I was
Invited to go to Washington and appear
before the Supreme Court in the two
cases. It Is possible that th" whole ques

the cases now pending. Senator Morgan
of Alabama and George Fred William^ of
Massachusetts have volunteered to a.Â«bist

and others are ready to do the simo

question which is to be decided soon."

of which he estimated as fictitious values. During
this period the increase of money in circulation in
the country was barely $140,000,000, a sum insig
nificant to finance this enormous creation of new
Mocks. He furthermore said: "Think of this hugs
inverted pyramid of credit, with so little money at its
base, and you may conclude, as I do. that the danger
of its continued stability overshadows all other con
siderations." In conclusion he expressed no surprise
at the decline in Wall street, and added that he looked
for a further depreciation.
Exactly what he predicted lias come to pass. He
was shrewd enough to back his judgment with his
money, and by shorting the market cleaned up 1
million or so a few days ago. It is thought, however,
that the worst of the liquidation is over, and grati
fication is felt that it has been accompanied by so
litt'e financial distress and so few failures. While the
shrinkage in stock values has been bad for Wall street
and its speculators, it has undoubtedly been beneficial
to the country by giving it an object lesson of the
foolishness of rushing headlong into all sorts of com
binations at enormous capitalizations, many of them
being so topheavy that at the first adverse wind they
topple over of their own weight. Philosophers may
also derive comfort in the proof of their own epigram
that every abuse carries within it the germs of its own
destruction, and that every evil will come to grief if
you give it rope enough. â¢

THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD.
THF. ancients had times and seasons in which
the spirit of humanity and the feeling of fellow
r<i-e above selfishness. In many different
r sentiment! of man were manifested
teason, under many different names, was
tly related to the great physical facts fixed in
(he laws of the universe. The Greeks had. at the
a inter solstice, the halcyon days, in which nature was
so gracious and sea and sky so calm that the halcyon
hatched her eggs upon the Bleeping water. These
Greek days con very closely to the Christian
holidays, so that in these modern times the great
festival is commonly named after the old
Greek season, "the halcyon days." There arc other
;n the year hallowed by the memory of great
events, consecrated to the human heart by an origin
in fear, in supplication, in sorrow or in joy, but they
are either special or national.
The Christmas holidays, however, are joined indis
solubly to the spirit of hopefulness and thankfulness.
â -. -c they were joined to ceremonial and their
â¢ ance was written in the ritual of the unbroken
church, very worthy religious bodies which arose
after the great schism attempted to ignore them.
This was especially the case with the serious, stern
and sober-minded Puritans. In the days of the Coni

"Merrie England," and when our austere forefather?

Down to within the memory of a generation not
yet passed awa not generally ob
served in New England, but now its celebration is
not more general in any part of the Union. The
change has been wrought largely by the importation
o: the universal German habit of making it the
special holiday of childhood. The Christmas tree,
the pleasant riot and clatter of childish pleasure and
n have won their way, and there arc but
few American homes in which homage, more or less
rnib not paid to that friend of the childlike

It is well for humanity that all this has con

done in harmony with its higher sentiment that poor

The â¢ rity of those who arc within its influ

ThjE LAWTON HOME FUND.
CALIFORNIA should do her share and other
States should do theirs, so that the fund now
being rai-ed for the purpose of paying the
mortgage upon the home of General Lawton's family
may he completed in time to make the gilt a Kcjv
â¢ 'tiering to the stricken family.
The contributions tint! far made have been gener
ous and prompt. They have been received at Wash
ington from all parts of the country, but mainly from
New York, and t.iken with those received in this city
ieneral Shatter they form a good start in the
work. It now remains to be seen whether the whole
fund can be made up before the close of the week.
In his brief circular letter calling attention to the
fund. General Shafter presents the issue in these
simple words:
"The history of General Lawton's splendid mili
tary career i^- too well known to require recounting
here. HtS life hai been one of devotion to the mili
tary service, and he fell in battle while defending his
country's flag. 1 1 is widow and four children will be
left in straitened circumstances unless the mortgage
Covering his orange grove at Redlands, Cal., be
liquidated. I am confident that the patriotic and
grateful people of the Pacific Const will respon-1
generously to this most worthy object, and thru
enough money will be raided not only to pay the
mortgage but to leave a susb^tantial margin in addi
tion for the use of the family ."
That is all that needs to be said uoon the subiect.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, DECEMBER 25, 1899.
It should not be necessary to add any elaborate ex
hortations or arguments or pleadings to induce the
American people to contribute, each in proportion to
his means, to the fund. The gift, moreover, should
be made promptly as a spontaneous offering of loyal
hearts to the family of a hero who devoted all lm
energies to his country, and who at last has fallen in
her service. Let us have no long delay and vexa
tious canvassing for money in an i>sue of this kind.
Let it come with the glow of the Christmas and b-j
ready for New Year's day.
COMMENTING upon the various plans which
have been advanced for the purpose of provid
ing ways and means for the payment of back
claims upon the Board of Education, Auditor WclU
is reported to have said in reference to a suggestion
that they be paid out of a surplus in the school funds:
"If there be a surplus in the school funds at the
end of the present fiscal year, and I believe there will
be, the law says very clearly that it must be carried
over into next year and cannot be applied to payment
of old claims. I would like to see my way clear to
passing these demands that were legitimately con
tracted last June, but I have closed my account and
they have never been called to my attention."
Pacing then to a consideration of the sum amount
ing to about $70,000 which is to be derived from the
inheritance tax on the Stanford estate, the Auditor
expressed the opinion that this sum virtually and
legally belonged to the city on the day Stanford died,
and therefore can be lawfully used in paying claims
ni that or subsequent years.
He then went on to say:
"Nol taking into account what was termed hy
Judge Seawel] as the 'illegal payment' in June, ISO 7,
of $113,412 18 when there was that amount of short
age in the school funds, we come down to the
teachers' warrants of November and December. 1898.
amounting to $04,405 70 and $0<>.672 40 respectively.
I am of the opinion that the inheritance tax moneys
must lir-t be applied to paying these demands, and
as more of such moneys come in we may discharge
;:I1 those obligations until we arrive at the claims for
$6000 in June. 1899. Only then can these latter claims
be paid, as the teachers' demands must of necessity
take precedence."
It is to be hoped that view of the case will be taken
l>y the Finance Committee of the Hoard of Education
and be sustained by the court- should the question
ever come before them. The public would be glad to
see all claims against the schools or any other de
partment of city and county government paid in
full, but if there be not enough to pay all. tin
teachers' should have preference. The obligation of
a municipality to the teacher> of public schools
is one of the most binding that a community can take
upon itself. These men and women give their daily
labor to the service of the public and are entitled to
their wages. It has been something of a disgrace to
San Francisco that its school teachers have not been
promptly paid, and that disgrace should be wiped
away as speedily as possible.
ONE of the notable feature* of the debate on
the financial bill in the House of Repre-ent.Â»
tives was the number of declarations from
silver men of their conversion to sound mom y
Among them was Joseph Siblcy. who is reported to
have said: "1 publicly predicted that if McKinley
and the gold standard were successful prices would
fall with a corresponding increase in the purchasing
power of the gold dollar, and we would have an era
of hard times and commercial depression such as this
country has seldom witnessed. Now I look around
me. and I see the forges blazing, the fires lighted in
all the furnaces, the shuttles weaving and the looms
spinning. F.vcry man wh<> has a day's labor to sell
finds a ready market for it. Everywhere there arc
plenty and prosperity, and s,, it occurs to me that
somebody must have been mistaken, and perhaps th.it
fellow was me."
These conversions arc excellent, hut they come
late. They served hardly any other purple than that
of giving Henry C. Smith of Michigan an opportun
ity for enlivening the Congressional Record with a
â musing anecdotes told tor the sake of the moral.
Up in Michigan, said Mr. Smith, the money question
is a dead issue, and any man who should attempt to
it would empty a hall as quickly as it would
h? emptied by a smallpox sign. The Democrats who
have been converted, he said, are right, but, bcin^
Democrat*, they did not get right at the right time:
a Democrat is like a man who sits in a street car with
his back in the direction the car is going; he never
i-ees a good tiling until he gets by it; he is like the
boy who when for the fir'-t time he saw an elephant
said, "Oh, mama, that thing i-; walking tail foremost."
Mr. Smith conceded it i> better for a Democrat to
â¢li/e prosperity when he gets a backward view
of it than not to recognize it at all. Sam Jones, he
~.ird. tells the story of an old free silver molhisk who
met him and asked. "Jones, where is all that pros
perity you were going to give us?" "Why." said
Jones, "it is everywhere; labor is employed, capital
if active, wages are good, farmers are getting good
prices for their crops, and a wave of prosperity has
swept over the whole country." "It hasn't struck me
yet." says the fellow. Jones looked at him a minute
and then replied. "Well, it is pretty hard to strike
nothing."
Sibley is one of the silvcrites who have been struck
by prosperity, and he has had the candor to admit it.
The Bohemians in issuing the summons for their
Christmas jinks got out of the difficulty of the cen
tury mark very cleverly by announcing it as "the last
Noel of 1800." That is a sure thing whether the
1900 begin or end a century.
Among the congresses which have been arranged
tor the Paris Exposition there should be one to deter
mine whether the big show commemorate the close
of the nineteenth century or the beginning of the
twentieth.
Victoria is reported to have requested that none of
the little Princes among her grandchildren and great
grandchildren be presented with toy soldiers or can
non this Christmas. The old lady has had enough of
war.
From the way the Dukes. EarN. Barons and
Baronets of England are volunteering to go to the
front to fight the Boers it is evident the dudes have
pluck if they do wear golf stockings and marry for
money.
There ought to be a large increase in the tourist
travel to California this winter, and if the railroads
ay( ie gouging the public it is probable the tourists
will come.
Chicago society is "out of sight." and recent re
porn concerning its sporty ways incline to a wish

STATE MINING BUREAU.
HOW TWO OF IT WORKS.
THE MINERS' BAD ROADS.
A CALAVERAS MOVEMENT.
NOTES FROM THE HILLS
The situation of California with its dual
mining bureau continues to be Inten
incertain. Governor Gage's own mo
bile mining bureau is at work In the hills
and hotels and State Mineralogist Cooper
is holding down the heavy one, other one,
or whatever It Is. In the ferry building
and waiting to see what he will see The
situation may be sealed when the State
â  of Examiners sits on the bills of
the Gage bureau early in January and it
may be settled some Other ti:-.
sits In th.Â» terry bunding, keepli .Â».
mass stirred u;j which prevents precipita
tion. Ti.e situation may not be settled
until there Is some sort of a shaking up.
It develops that the Governor has put
W. 1,. Watts in charge of the field work
provided for in the appropriation bill
which illegally gave the field patronage
to the Governor to the extent of $10,000 v
year and caused the trouble. Mr. Watts
is in charge of hlnwlr and Stephen Bow
ers. nd will probably soon be wielding a
scientific corps of three, as it is under
stood that when the Governor can decide
on whose friend to appoint there will be
an expert set to work on the mother lode.
Mowers gets $150 a month .u;d Watts gets
$-5 more, for being the boss the Gover
nor's geological adjutant general.
Mr. Watts' particular work outside of
the general supervision of Stephen Bow
en and the coming mother lode man, will
be in the oil Hold, in which be has to as
siduously worked lor several years as a
representative of the bureau. He says
that he will finish some geological work In
the southern region and men compile
statistical and general Information about
the oil Industry. Then be will study the
oil fields north of Tehachapi. These mat
ters will yield reports to be published as
bulletins. It is no family secret that in
the past the quite able and laboriously
compiled reports of Mr. Watts have been
cut down or pigeon-holed In the otttce,
which is one of the reasons for the lack
of fraternal love between Watts and the
bureau administration, it" Watts' reports
are cut down now he will do it himself
and be happy.
It is getting to be rears now since any
results of Professor Watts' constant pet
roleum labors have been published by the
bureau. The good of bis hunting and re
flecting has reached the public only
through private advices and contributions
to papers; but the oil industry will bo
bountifully reported on during the coming
year. State Mineralogist Cooper will issue
a voluminous and very valuable bulletin
and the Governor's bureau may be count
ed on to keep up Its own end. especially as
Gage is playing mlocene sandstones him
self.
Mr. Watts, by the way. is an interesting
character in one view; and displays quali
tiea of nobility even in association with
Governor Gage. His long experience and
wide acquaintance In the California oil
field have brought him repeated offers of
princely remuneration for private services
as an expert during the boom, but he
waves them aside and sticks to his scien
title bureau Job at $173 .1 month and ex
penses, because he likes the work, is de
voted to the cause and has no hunger for
riches.

The Calavcras County Miners' Associa
tion has begun a good roads campaign
and thus both done a good thing for Itself
and presented an example of what these
county associations in the mining
regions can do for home interests
by acquiring strength and . life and
taking hold of local problems. In regions
where mining is the chief interest and
main support of population and prosper
ity miners' associations should be the
leading forces in behalf of home Interests
and local progress, and they have the ad
vantage of the moral and other backing
of the powerful California Miners' Asso
ciation of which they are a. part.
At .1 recent meeting of this association
at San Andreas the good roads problem
was made the chief topic. The meeting
was largely attended and spirited, and a
delegation from the nlghbortng county of
Tuolumno was present. The spirit of the
meeting was vigorously in favor of better
roads and Supervisors and other leading
men discussed the question. What differ
ences of opinion existed arose over the
ways of getting better roads. ! The Issu
ance of county bonds was strongly fa
vored. The need of better road legislation
was pointed out and the important point
of putting road construction and repair
in competent hands and on a business
basis was made encouragingly prominent
One big result of the agitation was to
make the matter a live public issue in
Calaveraa County to be discussed by peo
ple and press. Another practical result
was the wise decision to first secure sur
vey*, plans and estimates concerning
what ought to be done and let the how of
It be attended to afterward. A commit
tee is now raising funds for this admirable
purpose and the progress of the move
ment will be watched with Interest It
has already proclaimed that Calaveras
County is awake and wants to keep going
Calaveras County need? a good roads
movement for its roads are generally v, ry
had. often requiring deep Bounding*
tiu-uush cither dust or mud to find bet
torn. But the same ii true of most moun
tain roads In the mining regions. They
were often laid out by the first fellows
that came along in early days, the pon
derous frighting outfits characteristic of
those regions grind them up like stamp
mills and Supervisors have to stretch a
little money ii long way.
Yet nowhere are pood roads more need
ed than 'n those mining regions and no
where Is the tax of baa roads so heavy.
Mining supplies are usually hauled long
distances and the price as surely figures
In the coal of development or of mining
and milling per ton of ore as does wages.
Each year the freighting charges from
railroad prints go skyward when the
roads get bad and each year hundred? of
mining enterprises pause or cease because
of the Â«"ost or absolute impossibility of
getting in machinery and supplies. Ma
chinery often lies at a depot or stuck In
the mud en route for weeks or months,
while wages and production at a
mine lessen or stop. It Is like a
tire In the mine as far as the com
munity Is concerned that depends on the
mine's operation. The developing mine
waits th.it much longer for production
and the community for the circulation of
money. The good roads people have fig
ured out in cents per ton per mile and all
that what the wheeling means to the
farmer's load but not what .t means to
the miner's new stamp mill, needed tim
bers, broken hoist, boarding house table
and balance sheet or to the local public
that gets moat of the gold that la Jug.
Now and at tin.' every year local papers
contain frequent news Items about this
and that mine stopping operations because
the teamsters can't get things through.
The mining process that most needs ad
vancement in these progressive days of
the industry Is that of getting through the
canyon as well as the hill and Calave-aB
County has taken hold of a big and wor
thy problem.
With all Its tremendous mining possi
bilities, its untold undeveloped mineral
wealth an I Its unrivalled possibilities for
success In mining, California's mm ng
field needs judgment to guide Investments
ai it i- needed everywhere Failures pre
few but mistakes aro made and failures
result. A recent one Is that of the Grltlhh
mine, at Diamond Springs, El Dorado
County, which baa not turned out the *Â>â¢
It was to do. Work has stopped and the
old Iron will be sold. Of it the I'lacervUle
Democrat says:
"The failure of this mine to be a pro
ducer reflects no discredit upon the able
management of Superintendent James
Richards, for It Is a well known fact by
all miners of experience that the prop
erty never was and never would be a
dividend-paying proposition. Any one
that wishes may go out an* view a hole
in the ground that cost some people JÂ«00,
000. and It .-ill came through making peo
ple see as some others would have them."

The eighth was Sacramento's banner
Inning. bh<vhan went to nrst on a hit.

touched the rubber when Me Hale rapped
out a stirf one to center.
Sacramento played a loose, frlngy sort
of a pair.*, their errors being frequent an.l
not far between. The Easterners played
better ball than on the preceding day and
had no difficulty In connecting with Har

thourh the rreat majority have picked
the Indians for winners with a big score
on their side of the line.
California's coaches say the blue and
gold eleven has a fair chance to win.
Coach Warner of the Carlisle eleven and
Director Thompson of the Indian school
say "nay" to this, merely because they
are strong In the belief that their men
form what they have no hesitation In de
claring to be the strongest eleven In
America. Not until two hours after the
line-up will the general public bo con
vinced one way or the other, and then
there will be enough post-mortem In
dulgence to last until next Christmas.
The Indians passed a quiet Sabbath, at
tending church In the morning and rest-
Ing In the afternoon. Director Thompson
cays his men are In fine fettle and ready
for any old kind of battle. Captain
Wheelock. who Is the victim of a bad co!d,
will probably play In the game, thus keep-
Ing the original eleven together. Califor
nia Is not bo fortunate, the team not being
In the very best condition, nor is It the
same Individually that churned Stanford
to a pulp.
The officials in to-day's game, which Is
scheduled for 2:15 p. m., will be Ben Dlb
blee. the famous halfback of Harvard,
and C. W. Goodwin of Yale. Tickets will
be sold at the grounds this morning at 10
o'clock.
The elevens will 'Ine up In this way:

LECTURE ON UNION WORK
GREAT COLORED REFORMER AT
ZION M. E. CHURCH.
Interesting Address Delivered by the
National Representative of the
Woman's Christian Tem
perance Union.
1 Mrs. Lucy Thnrman, the great colored
temperance worker and national repre
sentative of the Woman's Christian Tem
perance Union, delivered an Interesting
address yesterday afternoon on "Tempi
ance Work and Its Results" at the Starr
j King African Methodist Episcopal Zlon
Church. Mrs. Thurman Is one of the fore
most colored women of America. In her
address yesterday Bhe told the result* of
twenty-five years of organised effort in
the temperance movement. She traced
the advance which the V Oman's Christian
j Temperance Union had made since the
MR?. LUCY THI'RMAN.
woman's crusadp, from which it sprur.p,
was promulgated twenty-six years ago In
the little town of Hillpboro. Ohio.
"In the first year of the peaceful war
waned against the demon of intemper
ance." said Mrs. Thurman, "there were
250 loons closed in that town, and the
pood work has been pomp on steadily
since then. One of the Rood effects of the
temperance movement has been to bring
together representatives of all denomina
tions, and they have allied themselves to
the common cause of humanity. Another
result Is that the great evanÃelical
churches have discarded the use of fer
mented wine. They use the pure Juice of
thÂ«- srape instead.
"But the most important result to mv
mind l.Â« that accomplished by the depart
ment of scientific instruction, whereby to
day 19.W0.0u0 children aro taught in* our
public schools the evil effects of alcohol
and narcotics, it was no Â«-asy task to go
before the I-eÃlslatures of the different
States to brlnp about this reform, but
Mrs. Mary Hunt set about her task with
wonderful energy, until now there are hat
three States In the Union where this im

bjr the frequent and liberal use of

f-tcrms in the eastern Â«â¢ ;i* obtained the

running for shelter was the vessel kept
from foundering.
The Valencia left Manila on November
13, and between that port and Nagasckl
she met with a succession of young ty
phoons, accompanied by seas more than
usually violent. Captain Lane's logbook
shows that the voyage was one or the
stormiest and luckiest ever made on that
route.
Chief Officer Frank Turner's official ac
count of tlie Ki-ries of adventures and mis
adventurea of the Valencia leaves no
doubt of the genuine pleasure of the crew

Out Of Manila we Struck thÂ»* beginning of

being poured down one pipe, was not

snowed that the boatswain was gradually
emptying a large can of disinfectant, In
the bell<f that ne was doing his part to

by lonkinp. it is not alwayi possible to
bang It nt once in a closet with other
j clothes, as it may c dusty, and yet there
' Is not always time to Rive the needed
brushing then and there.
A woman wtio has always been able to
have the services of a maid has lately
Invented a most useful article for the
help of women who are their own maids.
This la a dress ..an(?vr, a most simple
appliance, which fits against the wall of
i any room, takes absolutely no space and
'is of Inestimable service. Like all clever
inventions. It Is extremely simple, and
consists of a brass rod iltted Into a half
sphere, also of brass, with a catch which
enables It either to hang down straight
: agalnsi the wall when not In use or to
out straight from Â».he wall when
needed. On this is hung the skirt, cloak,
wrap or waist, as the case may be, as
Boon as It is removed, i..c rod being
strong enough to sustain the weigh! of
the garment while It Is ueing brushed.
When the skirt is brushed and ready to
be hung In the closet all that Is i
Is to turn the rod and It falls straight
agnlnst the wall. In some houses there
are two or mree of these rods In every
room.
In the tight-fitting skirts that are now
so much tne Rtyle such appliances as
these are of the greatest value. The
hkirt can be hung up at once after It is
worn, and there Is no danger of Its getting
out <>f shape; after being brushed It can
b" put back Into the closet on one of the
bangers on which all skirts must now
Deeds hang. Such little Inventions as
these have far more to do with keeping
clothes In order than could well be be
lieved by any one who has not given at
tention to the subject. To put a skirt
away unbrushed means not only that It
1 Is likely to bo worn again without the
' dust being removed, but also that the dust
will Â«et into the fabric. The silk linings
remain Intact much longer If the street
dust is removed as soon as possible Hat!
and cloaks, too. that so soon show the
signs of wrinkles and wear, can be kept
f,.r a vastly longer time If hung up,
brushed and the ribbons or laces carefully
looked after.
It Is said that these hangers are par
ticularly good for women who go out a
great deal and who are kind-hearted
enough not to want their maids to sit up
for them, and who. whon they take off
their ball gowns and opera cloaks, hang
them at once on these ro.ls The maid
can then attend to them the next morning
and they will not have a trace of being
worn, whereas if left on sofa or chair, as
the case may be. they are bound to show
signs of wear. â Harper's FtsiSl

VIII.â AS YOU LIKE IT.
The Musical Structure of the Play.
The critic may attack the law and thÂ«Â»
natural science of Shakcfpcare with some
reason, perhaps, but nobody with any
feeling for the beauty of sweet sounds
can fall to admit that he had a fine ear
for music. It must have been a great
pleasure to hear him sing. If he had a
voice. And. aa a boy. his whistling must
have pleased all the creatures of fur and
feather that he met In his long strolls
through the Warwickshire woods. All his
verse Is musical, but "As You Like It" Is
the most lyrical of all his dramas. And
an examination of this most delicious of
all poetical dramas will show that It Is
not only a fantasia the scene of which Is
laid In No Man's Land, but that It has
what for want of a better name we must
call an "operatic" form. Prose In the
ANNE HATHAWAYS COTTAOtâ FROM THE BROOK.
Elizabethan time was not a mode of ex
â  r "n b'-fiulrifc hiÃh thought or dig
nity. There were many who, like Lord
Bacon, regarded the English common
speech as a packhoree never to be immor
tal as the Latin Pegasus would be im
mortal. And bo prose-wrltlng. not then
looked on as the art it is now, was not
nt fur th>- expression of wall
ment When Shakespeare has anything
not worthy of poetic expression ho puts
it into prose, following the opinion of his
time.
There is another reason for his doing
this, Proseâ rhythmical proM such
as Shakespeare writesâ gaTÂ« the effect of
contrast, of shade after light. It played
the part of the recitative in the opera.
In the first act of "As You Like It," for
instance, the scene of the orchard. In Oli
ver's house. Orlando begins his exposition
in a low key:
As I remember. Adam. It was upon this fash

crowns, and, as thou sayest. chared my
brother, Â«m his blessing, to breed me well; and
there t â¢ glha my sadness.
The scone flows on. exposing the motive
of the play until it closes with the bar
sain between Oliver and the wrestler. The
light comedy of the second* scene is in
prose, too; but the prose is more musical
than that of tho iirst scene. Cadences
chase ona another, link and interlink:

serlons business:
" thou art a gallant youth;
I then )ia'!Â«t ti Id me of another father ."
And loveâ a singing Cupid wreathed
with ferns and forest flowersâ begins to
play the lyrical accompaniment. Rosalind
sings:
"Did you call, sir?
Hlr. you have wrestled well and overthrown
More than your enemies."
And Orlando erica, or rather sings In
the sweetest tenor, at the end or the
scene:
"Thus must I from the smoke into the smother;
From tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother;
But heavenly ItoMllad!"

composition Itself, remembering that to
the cultivated ear word-music has a sim

reach the complex harmony of the musi

IRONING TABLE LINEN.
There Is an Art in Giving It Luster
and Brilliance.
There is more In ironing table linen thnn !
has been dreamed of in many housewives'
philosophy. There Is no reason why table
linen of even a coarse quality should not ;
J-.ave a glisten and shine that is the pecu
liar property of all properly Ironed linen.

luikw into thinking a. coarse table cloth
:- â¢ : the finest damask texture, but we
ran have a common cloth look as well if
properly Ironed as one far more costly
improperly 1.-iundered.
Ltncn by good rights should be dried
< nly enough to make it possible to Iron it
vll. It is well nigh Impossible to iron
Â«.ut wrinkles that have once dried in; even
with good sprinkling this is a difficult
task t<Â» do, as any one may know who has
tnÂ»d it. After the limn is washed and
rir.sej until <iulte clean, then let it hang
tn the run if possible until Just dry enough
to iron nicely. Have the Imn hot: a luke
warm iron will not do. Fold the cloth
lengthwise, if at all. for the Hrst pressing,
press hard and iron Â«m<M,thly until the
Tir.cn is quite dry; unlÂ« ss it is perfectly
dry it will not have that luster and bril
liance that all well-Ironed linen has. Fold
the cloth lengthwise until it is narrow
enough to suit the taste, and then cross
vise folding is allowable.
Th<Â» only iw>iniÂ« to be observed nre
Hit sr; In.n the linen before It is <lry and
iron it until It is perfectly do. This will
Insure perfect work.
Avoid March in linen as you would upon
rilk or puch fabrics. It Is entirely out of
place.
Table linen FhnuM l.c Ironed in the same
wny as table r'.oths. and all fancy fold
ings avoided. Sometimes in hotels fanrv
foldings are used, but for the home table
let the- napkins be folded in plain squares
tint t>e Ironed po perfectly that their gloss
will be an attractive feature of the table
decorations.
If Ironing embroidered pieces, these too
ehould be ironed before they are allowed
to dry. It I* best to fold such pieces ns

from the rinsing writer: have the towel
dry and roM tightly: do not let lie too

it strong pressure. When about dried turn
the piece to it n wrong side, and with the
embroidery face down Iron it upon a sur

and If the luster of the linen has been
dimmed a little by this process press
ugaln on tho right side, avoiding the m

HAYDN'S UNHAPPY WIFE.
The Composer Married Her Merely to
Oblige Her Father.
Haydn married not the girl he was In
love with, but her sister. "Haydn, you
should take my eldest daughter," Bald
Father Keller, the barber, and. as Keller
had done a good deal for Haydn, the com
poser felt that he must sacritlcÂ© his af
fections upon the altar of duty and oblige
the old man. At the time of the mar
riage. In 17G0. â¢ â â ... 29, while his
Anna Maria, whs 32. There does not ap
pear to have been much love on either
side to tart with, but Haydn declared
that he had really begun to "like" his
wife and would have come to entertain
a stronger feeling for her if she had be
haved in a reasonable way. Unfortunate
ly. Anna Maria had neither rhyme nor
reason in her composition. The enter
taining Marvllle says that the majority
of ladies married to men of genius are so
vain of the abilities of their husbands
that they are frequently insufferable. Bui
Krau Haydn was not a lady of that kind.
The world had emphatl proclaimed
her husband a genius, but t<> Maria it was
quite immaterial whether he wore a cob
bler or an artist. Nay. shÂ«i even commit
ted the incredible crime of using the com
poser's manuscript scores for curling pa
per, us underlays for pastry and similar
things. She was gay enough with It all,
too. *
When Haydn went from home she
would send him the most cheerful little
notes. "Should you die to-day or to-mor
row." ran one of these missives, 'there
U not enough money left in the house
to bury you." At another time, when
Haydn was in London, he received a let
ter In which Maria wrote that she had
lust seen a neat little house which she
liked very much and that he might do
himself the pleasure to send her 2UOO
gulden with which to buy It. so as to
nave In future a "widow's home." Pleas
ant reading this for the genial composer.
In the tirst case lie wrote without a trace
of anger: "Should this be so. take my
manuscripts to the music publisher. I
guarantee you that they will be worth
money enough to defray my funeral ex
penses." In the matter of the "widow's
home" he thought It would be best to
arrange things himself. Ultimately he
bought the house, and in spite of Maria's
frequent suggestions of his coming dis
solution he lived In It for nine years after
the had been dead. Prau Haydn saw

THE GREEDY CATFISH.
His Eating Capacity as Wonderful as
His Hold on Life.
The catfish belongs to an ancient type
not yet fully made Into a fish, and hence
those whose paired tins are all properly
fastened to the head, as his are not,
hold him in well-merited scorn. He has
no scales and no bright colors. His tins
are small and his head and mouth are
large. Around his mouth are eight long
"smellers." ileshy feelers, that he pushes
out a-s he crawls along the bottom in
search of anything that ho may eat. As
he may eat anything, he always finds It.
His appetite is as impartial as that of a
goat. Anything, from a dead lamprey or
a bunch of sunfish eggs to a piece of to
mato can. Ik grateful to him.
In each of the tins, which represent his
arms, is a long, sharp bone, with a slimy
surface and a serrated edge. These are
fastened by a ball and socket Joint, and
whenever the fish Is alarmed the bone is
whirled over and set in place; then it
sticks out stiffly on each side. There is
another such bone in the fin on the bitck,
and when all of these are set there Is no
fish that can swallow him.
When he takes the hook, which he sure
ly will do If there is any hook to be taken,
he will swallow it greedily. As he la
drawn out of the water he sets his threo
spines and laughs to himself as the boy
pricks his fingers trying to get the hook
from his stomach. This the boy is sure
to do. and because the boy of the Missis
sippi Valley is always hunting for catfish
Is the reason why his tincers are always
sore. The catfish Is careless of the pres
ent and sure of the future. After he Is
strung on a birch branch and dried In the
sun and sprinkled with dust and has had
ills stomach dug out to recover the hook,
if he falls Into the brook he will swim
away. He holds nu malice and Is ready
to bite again at the first thing In sight.â

he undertook the task with thoroughness.

Christmas Tree and Distribution of
Gifts at Many Charitable
Institutions.
OAKLAND. Doc. 24.-No child in Emery
ville will be overlooked by Santa Claus
this year. President Thomas H. Williams

ranged for the annual Christmas distri
bution of presents to take place next

Mission Sunday-school. He has set no
limit upon the amount to be expended for

The Â»'hristmas exercises at Fabiola lies- j
pital will be particularly attractive this

especially of toys and other treasures for
children. The inmates on Christmas are
usually wrapped up and wheeled to the
tree, and for the time being many of them
forget their earthly ills.
Mr.*. J. A. Folger, though far from
home, has not forgotten the poor and the
little ones of Oakland. Councilman Bar-
Btow, a director of the Associated Chari
ties, has rocelveu a letter from Mrs. Fol
ger, dated at Hoosack, N. Y. containing
a $100 check for the Associated Charities,
a $20 check for Mrs. Robert Watt to be
used for the Free Kindergarten In West
Oakland, and another $20 check for Mrs
Eugene Beck for the benefit of th- Cen
tral Kindergarten.
The garret of the West Oakland Home
was given over to the little ones last
night, when they produced their Christ
mas play from "Mother Goose." There
was also a musical programme. To-night
each youngster has hung up a stocking
for gift-. To-morrow the children will
have a turkey dinner, and in the even

evening and a quantity of clothing stolen.
None of the college men were In the build

Investigation Into the causes which re

between the San Jose freight and the Ala.
meda local at First and Linden streets
has been going on all day, and Superin
tendent Agler Is Inclined to lay the blame
for the accident upon Engineer Petera of
switch engine 1019. Peters was switching
a train of twenty boxcars, and. using
bad Judgment in backing, he collided with
the San Jose freight, throwing several
cars over on the main track. The local
train happening along Inopportunely
crashed Into them. Two boxcars were
wrecked, the switch engine and the local
engine, in charge of Engineer Dick Rey
nolds and Fireman Stokes, were over
turned, the water tank of the switch en
gine was punctured and the passenger en
gine's <â > under head was smashed in. A
crew has been working all night on the
wreckage, and it is estimated that J2500

company.
WINGED MESSENGERS OF WAR
The Pigeon Post Which Is Furnish-

Presumably the pigeons that are serv

now arrived out on the warship Powerful,
unless, which is not Improbable, certain
Britishers In Natal or Durban had es
tablished lofts where homing birds were
trained to the country. 1 am inclined to
favor the former idea, owing to the fact
that a naval pigeon post has been for
some time established and lofts have oeen
built at Devon port, Oosport and She. men
at a cost of about $-"iiÂ«Â»'. A couple of years
ago th.- Admiralty bought a large number
of -month-old birds and placed them
in the royal navy loft at Gosport, intend
ing to use them for the conveyance of
messages from warships to shore, with a

time of war. There are over 300 societies
in England for the cultivation of homers,

GOLD TOOTH A HIDING PLACE.
A Criminal Who Hid Saws in Tooth

"Rpeakir.tr of out-of-the-way pln^Q for

ing thai Detective O'Hare had found

THE CROCODILE OF HISTORY
His Live Toothpick. His Tears and
His Way of Getting Caught
in the Nile.
To nay that the crocodile has seen hi*
best days is but feebly to express the ra
pidity with which he is lapsing Into the
class of extinct animals. A.-> a fettvrt Of
modern Egypt he is perhaps rather a cu
riosity than a plague. anJ the tr i
has to get far beyond the regions >f the
Delta before he ,-an l>. gin to h >pc for the
chance of being Introduced to "ti> Cl
rodile stories ure no longer fold. \:. I
it is safer ti> trust to the sea serpent.
Nothing can make th- crocodile .
tive. and even the man with tl
is shy of treating him as a in
whether for personal or artistic n
Is not quite clear. Possibly the crocodile
resents being focused, as be formerly
shrunk from confrontation with ;i mlrr>r
âan ordeal which often led to his dying
of chagrin, as was supposed, at th.- sight
of his own ugliness. Moreover, th. >\i
rlenced photographer la wls.- in "1
no risks." remembering that th
dile's tears are only a natUl
which the saurian applies to the toucher
form of animal food.
And this is where the legend of the
toothpick properly cones In. Herodotus
noticed the fact, but seen to have been
misled as to the motive. He discovered
that the crocodile made friends with a
particular bird, which he allowed to en
ter his mouth in order, as the writer
supposed, to rid the reptile of the leeches
which infested his Jaws. Pliny says
nothing of these pests, but considers the
complaisance of the crocodile to be due
to the satisfaction he felt In having bis
teeth picked by the bird: "He taketh so
great delight In this her scraping and
scouring of his teeth and Jaws." Both
authors speak of the bird as a wren;
later naturalists described It as being as
large as a thrush, while It baa been re
served for the present generation of trav
elers to Identify this useful frit nd of the
crocodile as the snur-wlnged plover. Of
the fact of the alliance there is not the
least doubt. The operation has been fre
quently witnessed by numerous independ
ent observers, one of the latest of whom
considers that the bird does actually per
form the functions of a toothpick, "a pro
cess which the crocodile enjoys." With
such corroboratlon the narration of He
rodotus, subject to qualification as it
must be, is at least to be taken seriously,
and no longer regarded as the visionary
idea of a mere fabulist.
In the Egyptian hieroglyphics the croco
dile Is represented by a single wavy line,
ho perfectly suggestive of the contour Of
the animal that it Is quite impossible to
escape from Its meaning. It might stand
as an excellent contemporary Illustration
of the text of Herodotus, neither author
nor artist overstepping the modesty of
nature. This was reserved for later
times. In which arose so many of the
myths and extravagances which we are.
ready to Impute to the lack of practical
knowledge by the classic writers. When
Fuller lucubrated so learnedly of the croc
odile he doubtless felt that he was cor
recting the erroneous Idea of an earlier
period, and the following example of his
erudition may serve to show how he set
about the task: "The sovereign power of
baffron Is plainly proved by the antipathy
of the crocodile thereto; for the croco
dile's tears are never true, save when h<Â»
is forced where saffron groweth; whence
he hath the name of saffron fearer know-
Ing himself to be all poison and it all anti
dot"." As to legend of the crocodile's
tears. It can only be regarded as a myth
grafted upon some of the reptile ob
served habits. Probably because they
could offer less resistance to his attacks
women and children were especially lia
ble to them, the office of the former as
water carriers bringing them often to the
Nile nnd the children naturally finding a
playground on Its shores.
Herodotus gives an amusing account of
the manner in which the Egyptian broth
ers of the angle used to fish for croco
dile, from which It would seem that they
had taken a leaf out of the reptile' own
book of strategy. They patted the hook
with a large piece of hog's flesh, with
which they made a real angler's "east"
into the middle of the river. And they

temper. I got thorn together again. \VÂ«
were barely in position when we heard a,
distant cannon, and at the same Instant I
saw the ball high In the air. As near as I
COUld calculate. It was going to strike ex
actly where I stood, and I dismounted!
with remarkable agility, only to *cc the
mls-slle of war pass sixty feet overhead.
I felt rather fooll.-h as I looked at my
men, but a good deal relieved when I saw
that they, too, hail all squatted on thÂ«
ground, and were none of them looking at
me. I quickly mounted auain and com
manded tlirm to 'stand up.'
"We were ordered ti> charge soon after,
and the enemy gave way before us, for
which 1 was most devoutly thankful. Wo
passed some dead and wounded, the first
sad results of real war that I had ever
seen. At night bl:ick clouds overspread;
the sky; the rain fell In torrents; not
even a campllre could be kept to light up
the impenetrable gloom. I stretched m>
se!f upon the soaked ground. The pale,
rigid faces that 1 ha seen turned up to
the evening sun appeared before me. as X
tried In vain to shield my own from thÂ«Â»
driving rain, and as the btg foot of \
comrade blundering around In the dark
ness splashed my eyes ill of mud t
cloÂ«eÂ«l them in my first sleep upon a
battlefield."
A Good One About Joe Jefferson
A gjod story is told of an experience of
Joseph Jefferson, the great actor. A num
ber of years ago he played a one-nltcht en
gagement In a small Indiana town, ap
pearing in his favorite part of Itlp Van
Winkle. In the hotel at which he stopped
was an Irishman "recently landed." who
acted as porter and general assistant.
Judged by the deep nnd serious Interest
which he took In the house, he might havn
been clerk, lessee nnd proprietor, rolled
Into one. At about Â»; o'clock In the morn-
Ing Mr. Jefferson was startled by a violent
thumping on his door. When he struggled
Into consciousness nnd realizing that h<i
had left no "call" order at the office. hÂ«
was naturally very Indignant. Hut his
sleep was spoiled for that morning, so he,
arose and soon after appeared before thÂ«
clerk. "See here," he demanded of that
individual, "why was I called at this un
earthly hour?" "1 don't know, sir," an
swered the rlerk. "I'll ask Mike." Th<9
Irishman was summoned. Said the clerk:
"Mike, there was no call for Mr. Jeffer
son. Why did you disturb him?" Taking
the clerk by the lapel of the coat the Hi
bernian led him to one side nnd snld In a
mysterious whisper: "He were shnorlng,
lolke a horse, nor, nnd Ot'd heerd th*Â»
b'ys saying as how he were onct aftlier
shlaplng for twlnty years, so Ol ses to
mesllf. ses 01. "Moike. It's a eoomlng onto
him ng'in and It's v- r Juty to git the eray
ther out o' yer house Instantly!"â Leslie*!

FARMING -ANDS IN
WASHINGTON INUNDATED
Sudden Rise of the Nooksack River
Creates Alarm Among the Resi
dents of the Valley.
TACOMA, Dec. 24.â Heavy rains and
drop snows in the mountains, accom
panied by Chinook winds, have combined
to send an immense Hood of water cours
ing down Western Washington rivers.
The White. Stuck. Cowlltz. Chehalis,
Skagit, Skohillls and Nooksack are over
flowing the lowlands along their banks,
doing great damage. The greatest trouble
so far has occurred in the Kookaak Val
ley, where the river yesterday rose two
feet. The big railroad bridge of the Bel
llngham Hay and Columbia Railroad at
Everaon, a. 115-foot span, went out lajjt
nlgnt. together with several county
bridges. Residents of Everson and other
Nooksack Valley towns have been cutting
brush and heaving stone for twenty-four
hours in an attempt to save the remaining
bridges. The railroad is assisting with
work trains. Another county bridge at
Unden is washed out-
The Nooksack River has long been not
ed for its sudden rises, but all records
were broken last night when the water
gauge at Everson showed a height of 91
Feet. Many farms in the Nooksack Val
ley are flooded and considerable stock has
b^on lost. The shingle mills on the south
fork of the Nooksack have been badly
damaged by the terrific flood which is
pouring through the mills. Many rafts
with shingle Iwlts were carried Into Puget
Sound and lost. At Deming all the fami
lies on the water front were compelled to
move and water covers the floors of busi
ness houses. Similar results have fol
lowed floods in the Cowlltz and Bkagit
valleys. Thousands of acres of the finest
farming lands in Stuck Valley are under
water.

SWIFTWATER IS
IN LUCK AGAIN
Reported to Have Found
a Valuable Mine.
Special Dlfpatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, Dec According to news
received by G. E. Daniel and Ed Ralston,
who made the trip from Dawson to salt
water In ten days with a team of Jive
dogs, there was a stampede about the be
ginning of this month, the Brat that has
left Dawson" for some considerable time,
to a creek which enters the Indian River
about nine miles from its mouth. The
rush, in which a large crowd joined, waa
headed by William C Gates, more com
monly known to the people of the Yukon
and the l'aciiic Coast as "Swiftwater
BUI," and his brother, liumboldt Gates.
According to the stories being told when
the miners left Dawson. this new rind to
which a long btring of excited miners was
rushing witn dog teams ajid on Coot is one
of the richest that has been made since
George Carmach staked Discovery on llo
nanza. It is aid to pay as high as lluO
in coarse gold to the pan. How the (tad
was made or who the discoverer was the
miners could not learn. Should it prove
as rich a.- reported Swiftwater will again
become possessed of a fortune such as ho
made alter he was dumped In a drunken
M'i;..ir on one of the richest claims of
Bonanza, wljen that creek was first lo
cated. How ha went through this is an
old story.
The two returned miners report that
there is un almost endless number of
scows frozen in along the river. There
are a hundred or more craft tied up at an
island which has been named Scow Island
in consequence. So much freight for Daw
son is frozen in on these vessels that the
Government has decided to cut a sled
route from Selkirk to Dawson to allow
of the goods being moved in over the ice.
Just prior to the departure of the miners
the bridge tender at Dawson was married
to a young lady of 16 years, and for a
bridal tour they started to Cape Nome
with twenty-six dogs carrying supplies.
Other arrivals from Dawson are Jack
Carr. who brings the nugget express, and
C. N. Hanson, from the Forty-mile dis
trict via Dawson, who brings news of two
rich results of the clean-up on the Ameri
can side. Mr. Hanson says Jack Wade
Creek will prove richer than Bonanza ever
was. and the American diggings of Forty
mile will be one of the richest placer dis
tricts in the world. No. 7. on Jack Wade
Creek, has shown as high as $1500 for one
day's clean-up, and Captain French of
Eagle City took out $300 in an hour with a
penknife.

the services will be held, after which it
will be taken to the last resting place on
Round Too. The only music during the
service, aside from singing by the regular
choir of the church, will be the singing Of
"Rock of Ages." one of Mr. Moody' s fa
vorite hymns, by the Mount Syman male
quartet. Honorary pallbearers have been
named as follows: Colonel J. J. Jane

The Very Rev. W. R. Nell, assistant su

PEACEMAKER WORSTED.
A Tenderloin Visitor Has His Scalp
Cut Open.
James Green, a hanper-on about the ten
derloin resorts, was arrested early yester
day morning and charged at the Califor
nia-street station with assault with a
deadly weapon and vagrancy. Green,
while intoxicated, entered the Klondike
saloon, on Dupont street, above- Hush, and
brandishing a revolver declared that he
would make â  Morgue subject of the bar
keeper. Harry McKcane, who resides In
Oakland, was in the saloon, and not wish
ing to be a witness to a murder, grappled
with Green and tried to wrest the pistol
from him. The old peacemaker story was
repeated, with the result that McKeane
had a few stitches put in his scalp and the
satisfaction of eeelnK two charges placed
against his opponent's name by Officers
Nelson and Snowball. â¢
WONDERS OF THE OCEAN BED.
Some Strange Tilings That Might Be
Seen at Great Depths.
The temperature of the bottom of the
ocean is nearly down to freezing point,
and sometimes actually below it. There
in a total absence of light as far as sun
light is concerned, and there is an enor
mous pressure, reckoned at about a ton
to the square Inch In every 1000 fathoms,
which Is 160 times greater than that of
the atmosphere we live In. At 250) fath
oms the pressure is thirty times more
powerful than the steam pressure of a
locomotive when drawing a train. As late
an 1SS!) a leading zoologist explained the
existence of deep-sea animals at such
depths by assuming that their bodies
were composed of solids and liquids of
great density and contained no air.
This, however, is not the case with
deep-sea rlÃh. which are provided with
air-inflated swimming bladders. If one
of these llsh. m full chase after Its prey,
happens to ascend above a certain level
its bladder becomes distended with the
decreased pressure and carries it, in spite
of Its efforts, still higher in its course;
in fact, members of this unfortunate Ciass
are liable to become victims to the un
ui-'.a! accident of" falling upward, and no
doubt meet with a violent death soon
after leaving their accustomed level and
long before their bodies reach the sur
face in a distorted and unnatural state.

TIIBUTE TO THE MEMORY
OF EVANGELIST MOODY
RÂ«>v E. A. Wood*, pastor of the First
Baptist Church, paid a tribute to the
memory of the late Dwight i. Moody, the
famous evangelist^ in a prelude to his
Christmas day sermon on "The World's
Greatest Holiday.'' In part he Bald:
A great man has fallen â not a great
scholar or thinker; not a great writer or
theologian â but Rill a great man. Mr.
Mro: wu* KTÂ»at In !ili> Influence over men;
grrnt In the work he accomplished; great In
that ;nÂ»*r which lives and shapes other
ll\eÂ« uhlch come after. He has made his
mark u;>on the nineteenth century as but
few men have don*. His Influence In all di
rections ha* â¢Â« i. healthy, pure and always
on the right fide. The effeit of hiÂ» preach
ing upon preachers has been Inspiring and
helpful. There were those who criticized
him. but whÂ»n his critics heard his glowing
words, M full of the divine love, they could
but acknowledge his sincerity and also hla
power. There are MM lesson* which the
â¦ Tiristlan churches should learn from the
life work of Mr. Moody.

great learning can do to advance Christian
ity. Mr. Moody had great administrative.
ability. He mlzht hnve become a C P.
llunttngton or a John Wanamaker In the
business world. He cho?e to use his ability
in doing OÂ«d"i work directly. In work for
young men. In founding schools where those
without money could secure an education
*n.l In training workern for Christian service
he nits in-.-. nij.li^he'l much.
He has TnnnÂ»" the fact piAin that the gospel
of I'hrlst, preached simply and earnestly,
will command a hearing and will transform
the Jives of those who accept It. â¢ He did
not defend Christianity; he preached It. He
did not prop, up the cross of Christ, lest It
should fall; he jointed men to It and him
who died upon It. With absolute faith In
the teachings of the Bible. it was his mis
sion to present a living Savior to dying men.
He lielleved that In preaching there should
be less art and more heart. Mr. Moody was
a rnk.n of tender heart and of great faith In
<sod. and these gave him great power with
men.

It Is proposed to the voters of this city to
decide whether they wish to Incur debt for

I am not in a position to know our exact
need of a hoapital, but it Ip certain we can
hardly overdo the matter of caring for the
poor sick. As the kingdom of Â«.k1 advances
we should .more and more look after Â»uffe-
ln^ humanity. It Is quite evident that vie

certainly would add to our city's attrac

and If there Is any part of the city which

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, DECEMBER 25, 1899.
CALIFORNIA'S Christmas thil year is marked by more than the
merriment and cheery air usual to the holiday season. The return
of better times has had its effect. After years of depression and
gloom the times have changed and prosperity comes to California
as a welcome Christmas present. To-day will find the populace
prepared to rejoice. It has every reason for so doing. The spirit
of happiness, of merrymaking and contentment is in the air. The children,
who begin the day following Christmas to count the intervening days until
Santa Clans will return again, find greater vent for their innocent ecstasy.
The small boys will tap their drums and toot their tin horns with more
fervor, and the little misses will take more pride in parading with their
dollies. The older folks will not fall far behind in their enthusiasm. For
a day at least they will be children again and will demand their full measure
ol the joy that comes with the yuletide.
This happy condition is not limited in the extent of its benificent ef
fects. The rich have been favored and the poor have not been forgotten.
To-day is to be a Merry Christmas for everybody. Santa Claus has made
a record for himself, and. as it stands, nothing better could be asked for the
future by California and her people than to have recorded as each succeed
ing year rolls by a Christmas as merry, as replete with the spirit of good
\\:!1 to men. and surrounded with as many evidences of substantial pros
perity as that of 1809.
Many of the city churches held their Christmas services yesterday and
were well attended Some of the more pretentious programmes will be car
ried out to-day by the Catholic and Episcopalian denominations. There
will be special sermons and music appropriate to the occasion. A feature of
the religious observances will be the elaborate decorations in all the
churches. Hollyberries have been used in profusion and there is a liberal
display of flowers and evergreens.

AN ABLE CHRISTMAS SERMON
Rev. Dr. Rader preached an eloquent
Christmas sermon to the congregation of
the Third Congregational Church last
night on Luke 11:14. "Glory to God in the
highest, and on earth peace, good will
toward men." In part he said:
These word* contain the gospel of the
advent, which waa delivered by the angels,
not to the scholars nor to the kings, but to
the humble worklngmm of Palestine. The
angels surrounded them and Â»anr this an
them, which contains the Ideal gospel
â¢â¢Glory to God In the highest" means not
alone the supremacy of Ood. but that God
should receive glory In the highest places.
The best gifts of men should be employed
to declare his glory. If there Is one angel
which rtands on a loftier peak than all
the other angel*, let him express the glory
of God. The best places of earth should be
filled with his i raise.

DEATH THE END
OE CHRISTMAS
EVE REJOICING
Sudden Fatality at the
Occidental.
HEART TROUBLE THE CAUSE
D. B. SMITH OF HONOLULU DIES
WHILE HELP IS COMING.
Came Here to Spend the Holidays
With His Daughter and Was
Stricken in the Midst of
Festivity.
The Occidental Hotel was the scene of
a sad fatality last evening, which Is all
the more to be regTetted coming, as It
does, in the midst of holiday rejoicing.
While listening to the strains of music
and exchanging the compliments and
courtesies of the yuletldc D. B. Smith, a
wealthy resident of Honolulu, was sud
denly taken ill and forced to retire to his
room, where he expired before medical
assistance could reach him.
The Immediate cause of Mr. Smith's
death was heart failure, superinduced by
:i dOM of bromide, which he had taken a
short time before to quiet his nerves.
He had been a sufferer for some time
from weak nerves, and had been accus
tomed to have recourse to powerful med
icines to relieve him. Last evening, feel-
Ing one of Ills nervous attacks coming on.
he took a more than usually heavy doÂ»e.
and then went down stairs to participate
in some Christmas festivities, in com
pany with several other Honolulu people.
They were nil fitting in the parlor lis
tening to the music, which was being ren
dered by a Hawaiian string orchestra,
and having a general good time, when
Smith suddenly complained of feeling ill.
and started to his room, helped by his
daughter iind a couple of her girl friends.
As soon as his apartments were reached
a bell-boy was .sent to summon a physi
cian. He found one in the person of Dr.
Mlddleton, who at once accompanied the
boy to the room. They arrived there too
late, however, for when they entered the
apartments of the man who,, a few mo
ments before, had been delighting the
circle of people congregated In the parlor
by his wit and general flow of spirits, he
found him a corpse.
The Coroner was at once summoned, but
as death had resulted from purely natural
causes the body was allowed to remain In
the apartments at the hotel, whence. It
vMI be removed to-day to an undertaking
establishment to be prepared for burial.
Deceased was a native of Statesvllle. N.
C... about 40 years of age and a widower
with one daughter. For many years past
he had been engaged In business In Hono
lulu, and had been so successful that hÂ«
was generally rated by his acquaintances
as a millionaire. He was prominent In
island politics as well as In other matters,
and under the reign of the late King oc
cupied several important government po
sitions.
The dead man leaves one daughter. May
Smith, who Is at present attending the
Convent of Nmre I>ame. in San Jose. Ir
was to pass the holidays In her company
that he made his last trip up from the Isl
ands, arriving here on the 21st of â¦nls
month, since which time he has been a
guest at the Occidental.
Mr. Smith was a prominent Mason, and
that order will probably attend to his
burial, the particulars of which have not
yet been arranged.
NOT BLOOD RELATIVES.
Dewey, the Socialist, Neither Cousin
Nor Nephew of the Admiral.
A. M. Pfn-py, special agent of the
I'nited States Department of L,abor, ad
dressed a well attended meeting at Unlon-
Ffiuaro H.ill last evening, held under thÂ»Â»
auspices of the San Francisco section of
thÂ» Socialist Labor party. His subject
was. "The Kleventh <Vimmandment." He
dwelt at length upon what ho claimed to
ho the unequal division of property. hold-
Ing to the socialistic theory that It bor
ders on the criminal to accumulate mÂ«>re.
of the world's goods than a person r<Â»
qulros for his own maintenance. Mr.
Dewey has a very pleasing manner of
presenting his arguments iind his address
was listened to with the keenest Interest
by the audience.
The lecturer claims to h* a relative of
the admiral, but admits that the relation
ship Is not one of blood. He asserts that
they are both descendants of Dewey. the
settlor, who came to this country some
time during the sixteenth century. 'I he
orlÃinHl 1 lewoy had five sons. One was
named Thomas, and the special agent of
the Department of L,abor says that he Is
his direct descendant. The admiral's an
cestor was Joslah Dewey. a brother of
Thomas. And there is the relationship be
tween A. M. Dewey and the Dewey who
made history at Manila.

Courts Need Ameri-

THE FILIPINOS RUN THINGS
ISLAND JURISPRUDENCE NOW
IN a BAD MESS.
Some Little Towns in Luzon Have
Been Captured at Least Eight
Times by Uncle
Sam.
Judge J. B. Early, who has been prac
ticing law In the Phtllnnines, returned
yesterday on thÂ». transport Valencia. He
was her only passenger. The Judge is not
very favorably impressed â¢with the condi
tions of the Manila courts as at present
conducted.
"There must be a reorganization of the
courts before Americans will have any
confidence in the isi: - â¢ Hidlclary.'" H al<i
Judge Kurly. "The Judges are Filipinos
and they adjudicate along the linos <>r tba
old Spanish laws, which do not even per
mit a Jury. There are but tw.i American
Judges, and they do not have enough
power. Of course there *s an appellate
court, but that, too, is composed of Fili
pino Judges, who know but little of the
letter or the spirit of A million law.
"Until the courts are placed under the
Jurisdiction of American law Americans
will never settle to ary great extent ln
Manila. At present there Is the wont
kind of a Jumble prevailing. Spani.s.i Is
the language of the courts, and all mv
business had to be transacted through tin
