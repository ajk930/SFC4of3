IN A DIAMOND MINE AT NEW JAGERSFONTEIN.
CAPE TOWN, July < 9 - â A disaster has occurred at the New Jagersfontein diamond mine, where
the fall of thousands of tons of earth hasburied several people, including an Australian named
Forsythe. Some other Australians were killed and sixteen persons are injured.
In working a diamond mine in South Africa thr- 'faro" of tho blue diamondiferous earth is rarripd down to
t^p floor of the mine proper in benches. and sometimes, also, by "undercutting" and letting the material break off
and fall by its own weight, ft yap most likely in doing this that the accident occurred- These accidents are of
quite fi^quent o< cunrenoÂ«Â», though no! always accompanied by loss of liff.
At thr Kimberley minp on November 4. 188* ovei 250,000 cubic yards of dirt fÂ«-!l into thp pit, ami in th^ Dp B^ers
mir.f on another occasion 350,000 cubic yards fpll at onre.
The new Jagersfontein is the most important mine in th*> Orange Free State part of the diamond district.
The <npital â¢ npany operating it is Â£1,000.000 sterling.
It was in this mine thai the celebrated "Pam" brilliant, later known as th^ "Jagersfontein," was found. Albo

CHICAGO, July 9.â The Inter-Ocean
this morning prints this special
from Burke, Idaho; I'nder the ;
very eye of armed troopers and j
deputies union strikers last night
recommenced the reign of terror which
Is symbolized by murder ami "Knee- J
boning." Masked and armed, little ;
crowds of desperadoes moved up the I
canyon, and in their wake left grim
warnings that their victims must either i
quit work or suffer the consequences.
The Standard, which is being success- !
fully operated by a crew of Mlssouri
ans. was the sÂ«ene of most of the
crimes. Between 1 and 2 o'clock thts
morning three masked union men crept
in past the line of sentinels and made
their way to the boiler house. Fireman
I:. I-. Hudson, one of th^ .Topiin miners,
was on duty alone. As he turned from j
the glare of the furnace lie was con- i
fronted in the doorway by the three
men with drawn revolvers. Each was
masked in hlaÂ«~k calico, which reached
from the forehead to the chin. Two
Ivies for eyes permitted each of th*â¬
thugs to see. Hudson, who is not a
timorous soul, supposed at first the
visitors were some of his fellow miners
out for a lark.
"Hello," said he. For reply one of
the gang stepped forward and pressed
a piece of crumpled paper into his
hands. There written in lead pencil on
common note paper was this message:
"You are hereby notified to leave th^
Coeur d'Alene district by noon to-mor
row er BUCer the consequences.-
Hudson understood, but with calm
self-possession remained at ease.
"I'll get out of here when I get good
and ready." he replied, with a slight
.smile. "And T"H let you know when I
do."
"You have got till just to-morrow to
get out," replied the leader with a
flourish of his gun.
Hudson was not disconcerted. "What
siz* gun is that?" he asked with placid
curiosity.
"It's a 41."
"Oh. pshaw, you can't s<--are m* with
a 4J," a-nswered the young fellow. "If
that had been 44 maybe I would have
quit."
Meanwhile the smallest of the three
men had gone over to thÂ«* compressor-
house, a short distance away, where
Kngineer Wayne was at work. Through
the open window he tossed a note simi
lar to the one given Hudson, and then
returned to his comrades on guard
over the fireman. A moment later the
three disappeared in the darkness as
suddenly as th^y had come A little
later in came Wayne, the engineer,
white and anxious. He had been in the
(,'oeur d'Alenes in the old union days
and had little, liking for such warnings.
"I'm going to quit," said the engineer
to the young Missourian, and he did
this morning.
Meanwhile the gang had met Ellis
Hale just below Burke, and, after steal
ing his tools, had warned him to leave
on fear of being "kneeboned."
Hale needed no second invitation, but
took the train for Montana this morn-
Ing. He was one of the best mechanics

SAN JOSE KISSING BUG
IS HARMLESS.
Professor Woodward Says the In
sect Is the Common Prionus
Californicus.
BERKEI/RY. July R.â T have examined the specimen submitted by
The Call as the "San Jose kissing bug" and find it, as I had
concluded from the drawing published this morning, the Prionus
Callfornicus, which qccurs abundantly in the region between San
Jose and Monterey, and is also fairly common in .it her parts of the State.
Th* 3 Insect is one of the most harmless creatures in existence and cannot
have been accountable for the death of the kirten as reported.
ThP so-called "kissing bug" is well known to scientists and Is not,
as might be inferred from the name just now ci.yen it, partial to the lips
of its victims. It will sting whenever handled incautiously. "The fly
that is causing the commotion in the East is one of the Reduvioidea, ap
parently the Melanolestes picipes. We have several of the Reduvidiae in
California, all more or less poisonous. I get letters every littte while
from some one who has been bitten and thinks he has discovered a new
.species, one of them, Conorhinus Sanguisugus, the assassin bug, or,
more specifically, - the big bedbug, is common o n the Berkeley hills. You
can find them under any large stone. The bite is about as painful as a
b%e-sting. Of course it might, under favorable circumstances, produce
blood-poisoning. The more poisonous Melanolestes occurs here also, but
not so commonly as some of the other varieties. . â¢

ployed at Gem. Charles Sweeney of
the Tiger-Poorman had offered him a
place over thÂ° pumps there, and late
last night Hale, with a little kit of
tools, started for Rurke from Gem.
He was just on the borders of the town
when a gang of twenty or twenty-five
men surrounded him. What happened
may never be known.
The story believed here is that they
threatened Hale that unless he quit his
new job his family would first be killed
and hp would be "knee-boned" after
ward. This is denied, and one man who
saw him afterward is quoted as saying
that the crowd ras made up of friends
of Hale, who took that remarkable
time and place to argue peaceably with
him. At. any rat.--, "friends" stole his
tools and forcibly warned him to get
out. This morning he got.
The same crowd which called on
Hudson and Wayne evidently made
several other visits. About midnight
one of them, unmasked this time,
awakened Master .Mechanic Farrell of
the Standard and notified' him to leave
the country at once. Shannon, the day
engineer, was similarly â¢ treated, and
notice was likewise, given to a sawmill
hand. In each case the thug was rec
ognized, and search is now being made
for him. I
Engineer Shannon saw the mill hand
quit to-day. Farrell and Hudson, not
tobeintimidated.stayed by the company
and the fireman has been promoted to
day engineer. Although no fear is felt
that the warnings were anything but
bluffs, yet it is a matter of surprise that
masked men should have passed the
guards of soldiers and watchmen who
surrounded the engineer and fireman
on duty. To-night up the canyon un
usual precautions are being taken to
prevent a recurrence of such mischief.
JURORS SELECTED TO
TRY PAUL CORCORAN
One Incident of the Prosecution the
Appearance of a Former Grand
Juror as a Bailiff.
WALLACE, Idaho, July S.-The twelve
m p n who are to try Paul Corcoran, the
secretary of the Burke Minors' I'nion,
for his life were accepted by both tho
State and defendant to-day. Corcoran is
accused of tbc muider of James Cheyne
at Wardner April 28. The jury was sworn,
and after hearing the indictment read
was placed in charge of court bailiff- to
be locked up until Monday morning, when
the prosecution will begin its case.
The jurors are nearly all farmers from
the southern end of the county and soem
to know little of the troubles which have
agitated the Coeur d'Alenes for sonyÂ»
years past.
An incidont occurred when the jury was
plncod In the custody of the bailiffs which
caused much onrnment and is one of the
many occurrences testifying to the un
seemly zeal which, has characterized the
prosecution throughout. When the court
called upon the bailiffs to stand up and
bo sworn one of them was recognized as
having been a member of the Grand Jury
which found the indictment against thf>
defendant. The attorneys for Corcoran
informed the court of the fact and an
other bailiff was produced.
Tt has boon rumored for some time that
oortMin members of the Grand Jury ware
to be rewarded for thoir obedience to the
wishes of the combination which is be
hind the prosecution by being given lucra
tive employment, but it was not believed
that such utter disregard of all decency
would be shown.
Si!T"P the new order requiring 1 carpenters
and laborers of all classes to secure per
mits the mines have been having a hard
time of it. Tho Last Chance is doing
nothing: and the Canyon Creek properties
are very short-handed, the imported Mis
sourlans being: practically the only miners
remaining at work.
The following are the names of the
jurors sworn to try Corcoran, together
with their occupations: J. C. Buler, farm

WOODLAND, July B.â From a private
letter it is learned that Miss Belle Pear

of a rope the planking which covered the
curbing gave way, and she fell eighteen
feet to the water, which was twelve fe^t
deep. She sank twice before she finally
clutched a projecting stone, which en
abled her to keen her head above water.
Lusty screams for help brought her
mother to the rescue. An eight-foot lad
dor was lowered, and by standing on tho
top rung Miss Pearson was able to keep
her head above water until her mother
ran to a mine a half mile away and sum
moned help. Shortly after the rescue was
effected the entire plank platform over
the curbing fell In with a crash.

Mine. Dreyfus to Rennes, sends
Figaro the following account of
the treatment to which Dreyfus
was subjected on the Isle dv Dia

"On the arrival of Dreyfus at
Guiana, in 1895, he was not dis
i embarked at once, but was left
! in the bottom of the iron vessel's

"About the end of his impris
onment he was placed for months
on bread and water.
"In 1896, when Colonel Pic
quart warned General Billot that
Dreyfus was innocent, the hut in
which he lived was surrounded
by a palisade so that he could
no longer see the ocean. This
lasted for one year. The prisoner
I had attacks of suffocation and
: the doctor insisted that some
thing be done, therefore they
raised the height of the hut.
"Dreyfus was literally suffocat
ing in this artificial cellar. He
had violent attacks of fever and
then was put in irons for two
months."

ROME. July B.â At the beginning of
this year some stir was caused at the
Vatican by the discovery, made acci
dentally through the perusal of Mexi
can newspapers of widespread ani
mosity to the church in the republic,
due chiefly to alleged corruption of the
clergy.
Cardinal Rampolla began a searching
investigation. He has ordered all
Mexican Bishops to report fully, and
last month summoned the Archbishop
of Mexico to Rome.
The Archbishop insisted the newspa
per reports were malevolent inventions
of the anti-clerical press, but had to
admit grave scandals had occurred in
several provinces owing: to the methods
resorted to by the clergy of all ranks
to increase its income.
The Archbishop is now in disgrace,
for it is evident he has shown gross in
capacity. It is not improbable that he
will be removed.

A Friend of the Sparrows.
A philanthropic old lady who lives on
a small street below Morris for several
V' ars past has fed daily a large number
of sparrows in the front entry of her
house. A great many of the little birds
hover about the house of their friend
and perch fearlessly on tho steps and
window sills. The children and the
neighbors, strange to say, have the ut
most ivsuf (.'t for the birds and take
great care nevW to interfere with them.
The old lady pays for the regular re
moval of her ashes and garbage. When
ever the ashman comes the sparrows
are generally perched about nn the
ledge of the ash barrel, and the man
will not go near them until the old lady
comes to the door and calls them all in
side.
Recently an intruder in the shape of
a white owl came to the door, and these
was great excitement among the chil
dren of "the neighborhood. They would
not touch it because they thought it
was a new pet, but when the old lady's
attention was called to the owl she gave
the children icecream money to capture
it and take it away from the vicinity,

At first the censor refused to allow it to

EXONERATED BY
DUNG VICTIM
Officer Rice Fired in
Self-Defense.
DONNELLY'S LAST WORDS
HIS ANTE-MORTEM STATEMENT
BEAD IN COUKT.
Fresno Policeman Is Discharged, but
at Once Bearrested at the Ill
stance of the District
Attorney.
Special Dlsratch to The Call.
FRESNO, July B.â Policeman Tony
Rice, who shot and killed Daniel Don
nelly in the tenderloin two weeks ago,
had his preliminary examination before
Rec irder Cosgrove to-day and was dis
charged, the court holding that the
homicide was justifiable, and that the
officer performed hie duty in killing
Donnelly. Some of the testimony was
highly sensational, especially the ante
mortem statement of Donnelly. Dis
trict Attorney Everts tried to make it
appear that Donnelly was killed by
"Jack" Brooks, and that Officer Rice
merely an accessory. A number of
witnesses were produced who swore
they saw Brooks tire the fatal shot.
The statement of Donnelly, taken on
the morning after the shooting, was
suppressed by the District Attorney
until the defense compehtd him to pro
duce it in court this morning. When it
was read it created a sensation. Don
nelly completely vindicated Rice, de
claring that he shot at the officer while
the latter was attempting to place him
under arrest. According to his state
ment. Rice returned the fire and
wounded him.
Upon heaiing this statement read the
court immediately ordered Rice dis
charged.
Charles Ardell, who had been ar
rested for complicity in the alleged
murder, was likewise exonerated. The
charge against Brooks was reduced
from murder to assault with a deadly
weapon and he was released on $3000
bail.
Late this evening District Attorney
Everts went before Justice St. John and
procured warrants for the rearrest of
Rice, 1 -trunks and Ardell on charges of
murder. Rire and Brooks are now in
jail, but Ardell has not yet been ar
rested.
The action of the District Attorney
in attempting to .suppress the state
ment of Donnelly has been openly de
nounced as an effort to "railroad" Rice
to the penitentiary. He. on the other
hand, contends that the dying man
either prevaricated or did not know
who shot him, or where he received the
fatal wound. He says he will fight the
case to the bitter end and prove Rice a
murderer.
Friends of Rice declare thf> prosecu
tion is really a political fight between
the Republican Board of City Trustees
and the Democratic City Marshal, John
1). Morgan. Rice is a bitter enemy of
Morgan, and the Marshal was instru
i mental in having him arrested. Everts
supports Morgan; The Trustees, on
the other hand, have unanimously en
dorsed Rice by refusing to discharge
him. They declare the Marshal is try
ing: to pet rid of the young policeman
â  in order to make room for one of his
political favorites.
EYELASHES J^EN WED BY : :
IR^SfL/^NiiNq HAIj?
Transplanted eyelashes and eyebrows
are the latest things in the way of
personal adornment. Only the brave
and rich can patronize the new method
at present, for besides being painful anil
costly, it takes a long time to accom
plish it.
There is only one person in New York
who makes a specialty of the process,
but in Paris and London, where the
idea originated, there are specialists
who make a handsome living out of the
process, of transplanting hair from the
head to the eyebrows or eyelashes. The
specialist works by putting in, not on,
the new eyelashes and brows wherever
they are absent or grow thin, and so
cunning is he in his work that not even
the closest crutiny can detect any
difference.
By means of the new process, it is
said, eyeS which are at ordinary times
only pa?sable become languishing in
their expression, while eyes which were
previously considered fine have their
beauty much enhanced.
This is the way new eyelashes are
put in: An ordinary fine needle is
threaded with a long hair, generally
taken from the head of the person to
be operated upon. The lower border of
the eyelid is then thoroughly cleaned,
and in order that the process may be
as painless as possible rubbed with a
solution of cocaine. The operator then
by a few skillful touches runs his
needle through the extreme edges of
the eyelid between the epidermis and
the lower border of. the cartilage of the
tragus. The needle* passes' in and out
along the edge of the lid, leaving its
hair thread in loops of carefully gradu
ated length.
When this has been done another
and another length of hair is sewed
through the lid until finally there are a
dpzen or more loops projecting. By this
time the effect of the cocaine has been
lost and the operator is obliged to desist
and put off the further "sewing of hair"
for another sitting.
The next step in the process is cutting
off and trimming the ends of the loops,
and the result is a fine, thick, long set
of eyelashes. It is the finishing touch
that is to come that makes them look
like nature's own. When they are
first cut thtv stick out in the most
singular fashion, giving the person
operated upon the most uncanny look.
The operator's next step is to take
curling tongs, made of silver and no
larger than knitting needles, and to
give them the curve which is essential
to perfect beauty. Then the eyes are
carefully bandaged and kept so until
the following day.
Most of the hairs that have been
transplanted take root and grow, but
a few of them fall out and have to be
attended to. For the first month it is
necessary to curl the new eyelashes
every day, but after that they become
properly assimilated, and it is not
necessary to give them any further at
tention.
Eyebrows are doctored In the same
way, but there is not so much pain
associated with the process as in trans
planting eyelashes.
Regarding Red-Headed People.
Red-headed people, as is well known,
are less subject to baldness than others.
A Ivondon doctor explains the matter
thus: The' hair of the red-headed is rela
tively thick, one red hair being almost
as thick as five fair or three brown hairs.
With 30.1HM1 red hairs the scalp is well
thatched, whereas with the same number
of fair hairs one is comparatively bald.
It takes 160.000 fair and 105.000 brown hairs
to cover adequately an ordinary head.

ROOSEVELT A GUEST
OF THE PRESIDENT
Consults Mcr\ir)ley as to flrmy
Comn)issions arjd Approves
the Philippine Policy.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLINGTON HOTEL, WASHING
TON, July B.â Under the roof of the White House as the guest of Presi
dent McKinley, Governor Roosevelt of New York reiterated to-night his
confidence in the re-election of his host, gave warm approval to the
administration's conduct of the Philippine campaign and its policy with
respect to volunteer appointments, and scored the anti-imperialists for
giving aid and comfort to the enemy.
Governor Roosevelt's trip to Washington was made by direct invita
tion of the President to discuss with the chief executive the question of
the distribution of commissions among the men of his command during
the Spanish war and the volunteers of the National Guard of New York.
It had nothing to do with the war portfolio. It is stated authorita
tively that the President has not even thought of tendering this office
to Mr. Roosevelt, and if he did it would certainly be declined. Governor
Roosevelt will stop in the executive manÃion to-night, and will return to
New York to-morrow, to consult with his adjutant general relative to
the recommendations to be made from the State guard.
: 'I do not need to consult with any one," he remarked, "to make rec
ommendations from the regiment I commanded during the Spanish war.
I know my men."
If the Governor's trip is of political significance he will not admit
it. There is no doubt that he and the President discussed politics, and
there is no doubt that the Governor, as he said in New York, will sup-
port the President for re-election: When I asked him if he would make
any statement with reference to the President's candidacy for re-elec
tion, he said he had expressed his views in New York and there was cer
tainly no need of repeating his words. ,

in the integrity of the moral purpose of
the universe; believe in God and in little
children; believe in the goodness of the
world!"
Sailor Hat Trimmings.
Whateyer else may be said of the new
; sailor hats, they cannot be accused of
; meagerness of variety in the arrangement
; <>f the sashes and quills that seem to be
j the only trimmings allowed for them.
Probably the simplest arrangement is
! the three inch wide Roman sash banded
â  around the hat and tied in a neat bow
on the left side. A little more ample than
this 1* a wide sash, folded around the hat,
piled up high at the side and finished off
! with quills. The latter may be either
straight and stiff or soft and curled.
A still more elaborate trimming is that
in which two sashefl are used. One of
heavy silk go< s on iirst, and th.-n above it
is twisted one of mull or chiffon. The
latter is sometimes made, by graceful
loopings, to form a cascade effect at the
j back of the hat.
Decided contrasts of color are to be
found In most of the- hats. For instance,
i if the hat and sash are white, then the
i two port quiUs, just starting up from the
I s"ft white mass, are Jet black. No flow
i ers are seen on the sailor hat.

Longest Beard in the World.
Probably the longest beard In the world
is that of a metal worker In Marseilles.
The man is 74 yean old. When 14 years
of age he had a beard 6 inches long. It
grew from year to year, and now his
hirsute attachment when unrolled reaches
the respectable length of 10 feet 10 Inches.
When this man goes out walking he car
ries his beard rolled up In a big skein
under his arm. Since he is rather small
in size, measuring. but 5 feet 3 Inches, the
brard is more than twice the man's
height.
FEATS OF ARCHERY.
The Ancients Were Wonderful Mas-
ters of the Art.
Everybody has heard the story of Will
: iam Tell, who shot an apple from the
I head of his son with a bow and arrow,
; and of the wonderful feats of Robin Hood,
who roamed the green woods of "Merrie
England" and could bring down a wild
goose on the wing or split an opponent's
arrow with his own,
There are, many other curious feats of
archery, however, that are not so well
known. There was a famous William of
Cloudesley, who si>lit a hazel wand with
his Bha ft from a distance of 200 yards.
Homer tells how Penelope promised her
many suitors that ho only should be fa
vored
Who lirst Ulysses' wondrous bow should
bend
And through twelve ringlets the fleet ar
row S' ml.
Wen knowing that only her'husband could
display such power, in proof of which,
when they failed, he rewon his wife, for,
bending his elbow,
The whizzing arrow vanished from the
string,
Sung on direct and threaded every ring.
The Romans were very skillful bowmen,
although they discarded the weapon in
warfare, trusting to the charge and to
hand-to-hand fighting. Many of the Ro
man Emperors were famous archers, it
Is said that Domitian would place boys in
ih>- circus at a considerable distance from
him and as they held up their hands with
the fingers outspread he would send the
arrows between th.-m with such nicety
and accuracy of aim that tie never in
flicted a wound.
The wicked .Emperor Commodus boasted
that ho ne%er missed his aim or failed to
kill the wild beast he shot with a single
arrow. He would set a shaft in his bow
as Hume wild beast was set free in the
circus to devour a living criminal con
demned to die. Just when the furious
animal was springing on his prey the
Emperor would strike it dead at the man's
fÂ« j < t. Sometimes 100 lions were let loose at
ciiioe, in order that he with 100 arrows
might kill them. With arrows, the heads
of which were semi-circular, he would
Beyer the necks of the ostriches in full
llijfht.
The Persian archers, according to Char
lian, practiced at a mark placed on top
of a mam twenty-six feet from the
ground. Toward this the horseman rode,
with bent bow, at full speed, and in pass
iiiK the mark turned and shot at it back
ward, sometimes to the right and some
timrs to the left, seldom missing. The
}'i rslan bow required a pull of 500 pounds.
It is said that the Turks were at one
time very skilled archers. An old writer
says that they practiced regularly with
the bow from the time they wer 7 or 8
years old to manhood. It was a common
feat for them to shoot several arrows
from a distance of ten yards Into :i mark
not larger than a die. In July. 1792. Mah
moud Effendi, secretary to the Turkish
Embassy at I^ondon, shot an arrow 415
yards partly against the wind. In 179K the
Sultan of Turkey shot an arrow 972 yards
â a feat scarcely surpassed by those at
tributed to Robin Hood. â Cincinnati Com

ONE MAN
Whom the Saloonist's Sarcasm Failed
Utterly to Reach.
The proprietor of one nf Washington's
swagger saloons bpgan to notice a couple
of weeks ago the mighty onslaughts mado
at every noon hour upon the substantial
and rather inviting 1 free lunch spread out
in his place for patrons. The man would
stnill in just as the lunch was ready, buy
a glass of beer at the bar and permit it
to remain standing there, and then prance
into the lunch like a whaler just back
from a three-year imprisonment in i'olar
ice. He covered the whole layout, from
pickles to baked beans, and he regarded
other nibblers at the free lunch with some
austerity. When he got through the
lunch looked like the wind-up of a Roman
table orgy, and the proprietor of the place
waxed sarcastic when the chap walked
back to the bar for his beer on two or
three occasions.
"Say, you overlooked that coiled fish to
day," said the proprietor the flrat time.
'â¢You ought to be able to get away with
about half of that fish."
"No, 1 don't care much for fish," replied
the man, smiling. "Thanks, all the same."
The next day when the man had wound
up his attack upon the luncn and made it
look like the galley of a lumber schooner
after a bad trip around Hatteras, the pro
prietor said to him:
"You didn't see that other pretzel on the
dish, did you?"
"Why. did 1 leave one?" inquired the
man. "So I did. " and he walked back to
the table and got it."
The proprietor had a job put up on the
man last -Thursday noon. The free lunch
monopolist turned up, the hops of the sa
loon went up to him and invited him to sit
down at one of the tables.
"I've got a hot lunch to-day," he said.
"It'll be ready in a minute."
The man sat down, and then a waiter
came in from a neighboring restaurant,
bearing a "ray loaded down with the good
things of a dollar regular dinner, from
soup to nuts.
The man ate it slowly and with gusto,
th>> proprietor standing by to look on.
"Is that mock turtle right?" asked the
proprietor. "How's the roast lamb? Do
you like those apple fritters?" otc.
The man expressed his measurable sat
isfaction in reply to these questions, and
the proprietor was waiting for him to get
ashamed or mad and go out. When the
man had finished cracking the remainder
of the English walnuts, after expressing
his dissatisfaction over the comparative
smallness of the strawberry shortcake
that was on the tray for dessert, he wiped
his mouth carefully with his nankin, got
up and walked over to where the proprie
tor was standing.
"That's a pretty good lunch." he said,
"but they put out better'n that over at
Bal'mor'," and the Baltimore man walked
out.
"Sarcasm Is wasted on such ducks,"
said the proprietor, gloomingly. watching
th" Baltimorean's retreating form.â

Enter the Cabinet.
BIDS FOR RECONCILIATION
AND THE EMPEROR WILL AID
HIS AMBITIONS.
Various Positions Suggested, and It
Is Thought That tha Chan
cellorship Will Finally
Be Secured.
Copyrighted, 1599, by the Associated Press.
BERLIN, July B.â The rumors regarding
Cabinet changes have brought Prince
Herbert Bismarck and his political future
| into discussion. It |fl believed he is now
; anxious to wipe out thr memory of the
| past ami put himself in the way of an
appointment to an important place. His
recent speech in the Reichstag praising
the Government ajul its foreign policy has
been .interpreted as a i>id tor a complete
reconciliation with the Emperor ami bis
i advisers. The papers generally easpeet
to see him in some high position in the
near future. It is understood that his
Majesty is favorably disposed toward the
Prince's ambitions, as he wants to oblit
erate in ttw German mind the remem
j brance of his estrangement with the Iron
I Chancellor and wants to associate the
name of Bismarck witli his reign.
The Agrarians, claiming Prince Bis
marck as one of their men, would wel
come his return to public life as a victory.
The Deiitsches Tages Zeitung thinks he
will return tn office only when convinced
that he can carry out his Ideas.
The papers nave not yet agreed as to
what office is to be given to Prince Bis
marck. Some <>f them give him one of the
highest diplomatic positions, where he can
train for the Chancellorship. Mis name is
! mentioned in connection wKn Washington,
I but others point out that there is no pros
| peet of that post being vacant in the near
i future, as Dr. yon Holleben has been
, highly successful. It is believed Prince
i Bismarck prefers London, where he has
1 many aristocratic friends, including Lord
Rosebery. Some regard his appointment
i to a high home office more likely.
The Yossische Zeitung does not believe
| the son of the great Chancellor would ac-
I cept anything at home less than the
Chancellorship, and the opinion is <X-
I pressed in some quarters that this will
1 be in his reach at no distant day.
The press comments on the war in the
i Philippines and the decision of President
McKihley to increase the force of Amer-.
lean troops there are not hopeful for
j American success. The difficulty of the
situation is regarded as confirmatory of
the views expressed before the rebellion.
The Vossisehe Zeitung makes merry
over what it calls General Otis' "Napo
leonic art of preparing bulletins," and
adds: "With negligence of the most ob
-1 vious facts' he has been reiterating for
â  months that the resistance of the Tagals
j was broken, their armies in complete uls
l solution and the end of the war in sight."
The Deutsche Tagos Zeitung prints a
letter from a German at Manila complain
ing of the Americans "destroying the best
part of trade and industry in the Philip
j pines and deceiving their countrymen at
home by sending false news."
j Congressman Richard Bartholdt of Mis
souri has arrived here. The papers print
his speech of July 1 at Leipsic, emphasiz
ing th^ statement that the recent meet
' ing of German-Americans: was not held
in the interest of Germany. The German
: citizens in the United States, he adds, are
i loyal Americans, but insist on the main
, tenance of the historical friendship be
tween their native and adopted countries,
1 both Governments having been given pos
' Hive- assurances of the cordial relations
| existing, which the people would sustain.
Divorce proceedings in the case of
â¢ Count yon Moltke begin shortly and
; promise to be sensational, but part of the
trial will be in private.
The Rev. Dr. Dickie met with good suc
i cess on his recent visit to the United
; States in raising money to build an
American church in Berlin. The fund now
amounts to J4o.mii). Work on the church
begins in the fall.
The transfer of the Carolines and other
islands to Germany takes place In the fall.
A warship will l>e sent to the inlands to
take formal possession of them and hoist

WILL MARK THE SPOT
OF A MIRACULOUS RESCUE
Queen Margaret Will Attend the Un
veiling of Her Statue to the
Virgin on the Alps.
ROME. July B.â Queen Margaret has
promised to climb Rocciam^lone, one of
the highest peaks of the Italian Alps, and
take part in tho unveiling there of the
statute to tho Virgin, of which she herself
is the sculptor. About two years ago a
company nf Alpine militia was marching
over Rocciamelone, when an avalanche
w;is encountered, and nearly all were
buried beneath the mass of snow. Assist
ance was quickly sent from the nearest
military post, and all the entombed men
rescued.
â¢ The Queen was strangely moved by the
incident. She composed a thanksgiving
prayer to the Vlrigin, and resolved to
make a statue and erect it on the spot,
and have a verse of this prayer engraven
upon the pedestal.
REDUCTION IN WAGES.
Skilled Labor Suffers a Heavy Cut at
Mare Island.
VAIiLEJO. July. B.â The Naval Board of
Wages for the Mare Island Navy Yard
made its semi-annual report to-day, cut
ting the wages of nearly all skilled labor.
Sparmakers were cut 66 cents, ship join
ers 24 cents and nearly all workers in Iron
and wood received similar cuts. The com
pensation of unskilled labor remains as
before. About 600 men are affected.
Site for New Powder Works.
BAN RAFAEL,, July B.â Timothy Hop
kins and Charles Felton, two directors of
the United States Smokeless Powder
Company, visited Point San Pedro to-day
and selected a new site for a powder
workrf about a mile east of McNeara
Landing. It le said by Manager Newel!
that the new plant will cost $600,000, while
200 men will be employed. In addition to
powder, nitroglycerin will be manufac
tured.

KAISER'S VISIT
TO FRENCH SHIP
Causes Satisfaction at
Berlin.
GRACEFUL ACTS BEAR FRUIT
WILLIAM'S COURTESY TO THE
PARIS GOVERNMENT.
Some, However, Make the Comment
That the Emperor Merely De
sires to Visit the Great
Exposition.
Copyrighted, XBM, by the Associated PresK.
BERLIN*. July S.â Emperor William's
visit to the French training ship Iphi
genie at Bergen on Thursday, and his
cordial exchange of telegrams with
President Loubet. were not only re
ceived with great satisfaction hero. bin.
throughout Europe. As one paper put
it. it promises to be a turning point in
the world's history. At the opening of
the Kiel canal his Majesty went on
board one of the French ships, but In
the present instance, it is maintained,
the Emperor set foot on the deck of a
French vessel, which is equivalent to
French soil, by the express Invitation
of her commander, who was acting
upon instructions from his Govern
ment. It is therefore believed here that
the many graceful and courteous atten
tions which during the past seven . or
eight years the Emperor has been in
the habit of paying to the French Gov
ernment have borne fruit. The Em
peror's act has been sympathetically Â«
received in France, though some Bee in
it only a desire to visit the Paris Ex
position in 1900. Most of the papers
print the Iphigenie telegrams without
comment.
The Tageblatt says: "It was the first
official act of France for a generation
expressing a desire for more friendly
relations. The courtesy of the Kaiser
is gradually telling upon France."
The Vossiche Zeitung says: "The In
cident must fill with satisfaction the
friends of the republic, not only on both
sides of the Vosges, but everywhere ir.
the world. It proves the present rulers
of France are not hypnotized with the
Idea of a revanche and have the moral
courage to show it."
The Lokal Anaeiger sees in the' Inci
dent proof of good relations.
The Cologne Gazette looks upon it as
an indication of how far French and
German sentiments have moderated
recently.
The Vorwaets does not see in the af
fair a turning point. in the world's his
tory, and sarcastically expresses the
hope i hut Professor Stengel's mind
would now become more peaceful. The
"attitude of the French press has
caused much satisfaction here.
Dogday dullness has suddenly set
tled upon Berlin. The Diet has ad
journed to August 14, and the Herren
haua to August 17. Nearly all the Min
isters have departed on their vacations
and the political excitement of the past
Aveek has given place to a quiet which
the papers can only disturb by invent
ing new rumors of Ministerial changes.
The Emperor is yachting off the Nor
wegian coast. No exciting speeches
may be expected from him, and during
his absence the public has settled down
for a month of quiet.

VANCOUVER, B. C, July Con
gressman W. M. Sulzer and H. Deman- ;
ville of New York arrived here last ;
Wednesday. They were en route for a j
hunting tour in Alaska. To-day they
left for the north, but under Car differ- |
ent circumstances than they had anti- 1
cipated. The day after they arrived
here "Mrs. Harrington, New York," !
was registered at the Hotel Vancouver,
and it was the bearer of that name who
made the third person in the romantic I
occurrences of the last two days. All
three are credited with being very j
wealthy, and the woman introduced '
herself around the hotel as the fiancee I
of Congressman Hulzer. It was evident, j
however, that neither of the men was
enamored of her. and they explained J
that she had been only a day behind !
th"m in coming across the continent. â 
The Congressman and his hunting j
friend decided to escape, and to do this
they booked tickets late last night en
the steamer Dirigo for Skaguay. The j
woman in the rase, however, became i
possessed of the Idea'that her two male I
escorts were planning to give her the
slip. She accordingly mounted guard
on the hotel veranda. She was clothed
in a lashing serge skirt, a natty sailor I
hat and a somber cloak, which some- ;
what spoiled the otherwise bright effect
of the get-up. For two hours she j
maintained a vigilant watch and then j
she thought of the steamer that was to I
sail for Alaska. 'I
She found that the steamer must sail '<
at 4 o'clock in the morning and she sur
mised that the gentlemen must have
made their escape by way of the ladies' '
entrance. She started in pursuit. -*nd |
before long she, too, was booked for I
Skaguay. When the vessel sailed she j
was in her cabin, all unknown to the I
statesman and his friend, who had ;
gone to sleep safely the night before.

COUNCIL OF EDUCATION fIT WORK
LOS ANGELES, July Bâ The wppk that (
has been set apart for the thirty
eighth annual convention In Los An
geles of the National Educational As
sociation was ushered In when Professor j
A. R. Taylor of the Kansas Normal School j
at Emporia. president of the National
Council of Education, called this notable
body of educators to order at 2:30 o'clock
this afternoon.
The National Council Is. in a measure,
an annex of the National Educational As- |
sociation. It is composed of sixty teach
ers that have established reputations as
educators. Members are elected for terms
of six years each, and vacancies are Ailed
at the annual meetings. The principal oh. \
ject of the council is to discuss the educa
tional problems and endeavor to perfect
plans of Improvement. All Investigations
of educational problems, the expense of
which is borne by the association, are
conducted under the direction of the Na

the Lakes of Killarney if the owners

the National Trust probably would

THE OLD WAY
! Of Treating- Dyspepsia and Indiges-
tion by Dieting a Dangerous
and Useless One.
We say the old way. but really it is a
very common one at present time, and
many dyspeptics and physicians as well
! consider the first Btep to take In attempt-
| ing to cure indigestion is to diet, either by
I selecting certain foods and rejecting oth-
j ers. or to greatly diminish the quantity
i usually taken; in other words, the starva-
| tion plan is by many supposed to be the
j first essential.
The almost certain failure of the starva-
j tion cure for dyspepsia has been proven
; time and again, but still the moment dys- \
i pepsin makes its appearance a course of
: dieting is at once advised.
All this is radically wrong. It is foolish
| and unscientific to recommend dieting or
starvation to a man suffering from dys-
pepsia, because indigestion itself starves
every organ and every nerve and every
i fiber in the body.
What the dyspeptic wants is abundant
; nutrition, which means plenty of good,
â  wholesome, well cooked food and some-
thing to assist t lie weak stomach to digest
â¢ it. This is exactly the purpose for which
: Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are adapted,
'. and this is the method by which they
; cure the worst cases of dyspepsia; in oth-
. r words, the patient eats plenty of whoie-
! some food and Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
i digest it for him. In this way the system
I is nourished and the overworked stomach
; rested, because the tablets will digest The
j food whether tlfe stomach works or not.
One of these tablets will digest 3000 grains |
of meat or eggs.
Your druggist will tell you that Stuart's !
I Dyspepsia Tablets is the purest and ;
I safest remedy for stomach troubles, and
: every trial makes one more friend for this
â¢ excellent preparation. Sold at 50 cents for

GREAT INTEREST
IN LACKEY'S CASE
Tests of Dr. Sanarelli's
Yellow Fever Serum.
â 1_ _
PATIENT IS DOING WELL
BUT HIS RECOVERY IS YET UN
CERTAIN.
Even Scientists of Paris Are Curious
to Ascertain if the Latest
Experiment Will Be
Successful.
â¦ â 
Special Dispatch to The Call
NEW YORK. July S.â Much interest
has been shown throughout th'? coun
try in the condition of Mr. Lackey, whe
is suffering from yellow fever. This
case is one of unusual interest, f<>f it
may contribute useful data for a study
of the effects of the antidote suggested
by the experiments of Dr. Sanarelli.
The Herald has sent for 300 bottles of
Sanarelli's serum, which is identical
with the preparation used by Dr. Doty.
This amount of serum would be suffi
cient to give a thorough test to the
remedy. Dr. Doty, in spite of the fact
that many well-knQwn physicians are
not Inclined to accept Dr. Sanarelli's
discovery of the micro-organism of yel
low fever, gave the theory of ihe young
Italian bacteriologist a careful and im
partial Investigation. He Isolated the
organism before the publication ol Dr.
Sanarelli's discovery, and from cultures
which the latter s-nt him he was able
to see that the two organisms were
identical. John Ferguson and John
Tklwarsfa, two yellow fever suspects on
the McCiellan, did not contract the dis
ease. The other passengers who were
sent to Hoffman Island for observation
are all well and are in cheerful spirits.
Dr. Doty said to-day that he could
not give any opinion as to whether the
man would recover or not. He has fre
qu< ntly seen cases where the patients'
condition seemed to be encouraging, yet
a sudden change would carry them be
yond the point where medical skill was
able to aid th m Mr. Lackey has
received r.o medicines whatever and he
has not had an injection of serum since
the third one administered at 7 o'clock
last Friday.
PARIS, July S.â The publicity given
by the Hera!. 1 , to Dr. Sanarelli's serum
for yellow fever has not passed unno
ticed in Paris. Scientists are curious
tv see whether the success that at
â d Dr. Sanarelli's experiments will
be repeated. People are asking why
the United States has not tried the se
rum before It cannot be because tht>
administration was ignorant of Sana
relli's remedy, for it was officially of
fered them over a year ago.
It appears, according to a statement
made by a Herald correspondent, that
when the Spanish -American war broke
out the full particulars of the success
that had attended the use of the serum
under Sanarelli'fl directions and of the
means of procuring' it steps were taken
with a view of bringing this invention
before the Government.

Alarming Reports.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
There has been but little im
provement in the condition of the
sufferers irom floods in Texas
during the past twenty-four hours.
The State government is making
the most strenuous exertions to
get food to the starving and to
rescue the perishing, and the
National Government is fending
all the aid possible, but there is j
a woeful lack of means of trans
portation, and many of the flood
victims are in districts so remote
from centers of population that
days must elapse before they can
be reached.
AUSTIN, T^x.. July B.â The situa
in the lower part of the
inundated district, where the full
the great Brazos river
ams felt, has improved but little
during the last twenty-four hours.
Governor Sayers has b^en in constant
!â¢â !â¢ ur;i phi'- communication with many
of the accessible points in thedevastated
region, and all day long appeals for aid
have poured In to the Chief Executive
from the suffer* is.
There is a shortage of efficient boats
rform the rescue work promptly.
and it Is feared that there has been a
loss of life In Brazoria and Fort Bend
counties on this account.
Among the telegrams received by the
Governor to-day was one from A. F..
Masterson of Alvin, stating that th~
situation in a large area of country
extending from Sandy Point, Brazoria
County, to the mouth of the Brazos is
alarming; that there are hundreds of
waterbound negroes without food nnl
r In the section named, and that
boats will be needed at once.
In addition to the stranded men, '
women and children, who r.re occupy- j
Ing perilous positions In tree tops and
other places of refuge, awaiting succor, i
th-;-' are hundreds of destitute suffer
ers at Chenango, Columbia and Sandy
Point.
The limited food supplies at thesÂ«
places have been exhausted and the re- i
lief boats had not reached them up to i
this evening! being engaged in dis
tributing supplies and relieving the ter
liÃtreÃS at points above there.
The Governor also received a tele
gram from J. J. Juliffe, a prominent
man of Juliffe. Fort Bend County, stat
ing that the place is In the midst of a
f water and that there are many
c in the bottoms in that locality
who will ni.^t their deaths from star
vation very sour, unless boats are sent
to their rescue. The telegram concludes
by appealing to the Governor to have
boats sent there immediately, as there
is no lumber available of which to
make them, nor dry ground on which
to perform the work should material
b< ru hand. The committee which has
charge of the relief boats -were notified
Immediately, and it is expected that the
refugees of that locality will be taken
in and cared for by to-morrow morn-
ing.
The first estimates of losses of prop
erty and life in Fort Bend and Bra
zoria counties will be exceeded, as the
Brazos has destroyed everything in its
path in those two rich counties. The
waters cover nearly the whole of both
counties to a depth of from two feet
to seventy feet.
The picture of desolation afforded
those who are engaged in the rescuing
work is heartrending. Thousands of
homeless people are utterly helpless.
Many children are already sick from
exposure. The Velasco terminal rail
road, which traverses the valley of the
Brazos nearly -all the way from Co
lumbia to Velasco, is said to be all un
der water and communication from Ve
lasco is cut off except by boat.
Oyster Creek and the Brazos have
met at several points, and this conver
gence has trapped a large number of
negroes whose fate is not yet known.
Boats have been sent to their relief,
but it is feared that many of them
have already been drowned. Ad

20,000 Government rations, which ar
rived h< re last night from Fort Sam
Houston, was carried on all day and
will be continued all night, in order t<>
relieve th.- terrible pangs of hundreds
of refugees who are being constantly
brought into the stricken town from
the outlying inundated districts.
The distribution of supplies is In
charge of State Hanger Captain L. I'
Sicker and two privates. Many of the
people who were supplied with rations
to-day had been wholly without food
for three days. In their weakened
condition they could hardly stand and
of them had to be lifted into the
boats.
Governor Sayers was notified to-day
ihat the 20,000 rations at Richmond
will not be sufficient to relieve the suf
fering at that plac and that further
aid is necessary.
Some remarkable incidents occurred
during the great rise of Brazos. Henry
Leffort, a well-to-do white planter, liv
ing In the bottoms east of Ouster. Bra
zoria County, was at home with his
family when his house was swept
away* The place had been surrounded
by water before they were aware of
their danger.
The house was a two-story structure,
and as it was carried down stream, Mr.
Leffort, wife and children made their
way to the bedroom, a second floor
room, by crawling through a hole cut
with a hatchet. The building was car
ried down stream over two miles, in
tact and in an upright position, and
finally lodged against two large cot
tonwood trees, where it has withstood
the ravages of the flood up to this time.
Mr. Leffort and family were rescued
to-day. When found he and his fam
ily were living on the roof of the house,
making the best of the situation. By
diving he had managed to obtain pro
visions fr^rn the first floor and they
had not suffered for food.
Numerous other incidents of an
equally remarkable nature are related
by reliable parties. Thomas B. Dra
vert, an experienced and prominent cot
ton man, arrived here this afternoon
from a four days' trip through the
flooded region, lie made a careful in
vestigation of the results of the inun
n on the cotton crop, and he says
that in his opinion the lops will amount
to fully 80 per cent of the cotton yield
in Central and South Texas. The corn
ciop loss is about 60 per cent. Mr. Dra
wn stated that the extent of the de
vastation cannot be imagined. A visit
to the stricken region is necessary in
order to fully realize the direful effects
of the terrible flood.
Colonel L. M. Oppenheimer, an ex
tensive tobacco planter of Montgomery
County, was here to-day. He estimates
that the heavy rains and high waters
have caused a loss of from 30 to 50 per
cent of the tobacco crop. The several
hundred leased State penitentiary con
victs who were, employed on sugar cane
plantations in Fort Bend County that
are now covered to a depth of several
feet of water were removed to higher
ground before the great rise came. No
information was received to-day from
the Harlem penitentiary farm, which is
under water.
Governor Sayers received a telegram
this afternoon from County Judge E. P.
Curry of Washington County, stating
that there are about 2000 destitute peo
ple in that county.
A telegram was received from S. R.
Blake of Belleville, Austin County, stat
ing that the people of that town have
fed 2000 people in the past three days,
and that the donations are exhausted.
The same telegram states that there
are 1200 destitute people gathered at a
point north of Seal; .
George D. Neal of Navasota notified
the Governor that there are 800 flood
sufferers at that place in absolute need.
These are only a few of the many
telegrams received telling of destitu
tion and hunger.
The Governor is directing the dis
tribution of money and supplies.
Among the cash contributions received
by him to-day were the following:
From the Mayor of Boston, Mass.,
I $3800; from the ML and T. Railway,
! $1000: from the National Enameling
, and Stamping Company of New York
â¢ City, $1000; from the Hamilton Brown
Shoo Company of St. Louis, $500. Sev
eral thousand dollars were received
from the Mayors of Texas cities. Near
ly 10,000 of the Government rations
which arrived at Richmond last night
have been exhausted, and at the pres
ent rate all of the 20,000 rations will be
given out by to-morrow night.
Refugees are coming to Richmond In
boats from all neighborhood communi
ties, and in another day several
thousand will ho congregated there de
j pendent wholly on charity.
FORTY-FIVE THOUSAND

AUSTIN, Texas. July B.â Governor Say
ers stated to-night to an Associated Press
correspondent that, judging from all the
reports he had received officially from the
j flooded districts, there had been great

j porate; that hundreds of people had been

borhood of 45,000 people, the majority of
them being negroes, who were dependent
on public charity for sustenance.
The suffering of the waterbound refu
gees has been very great. The Governor
figures that the loss of life has been com
paratively small, not exceeding fifty per
sons. The heaviest farming losses will
fall upon the owners of the big planta
tions in the bottoms, who have lost ail their
crops and much of their personal pro pi rty
and are not being protected In the distri
bution of charity, which Is being- ex
pended only among the poor.
Up to to-night Governor Sayers has re
' $30,000 in money contributions from
this- State and from the Bast In addi
tion thereto he has sent out several car
loads of groceries which have been do
nated by different cities of the State.
Th.' situation is being well handled now.
everything having got down to s
tematic precision, :md the Governor stat .
to-night that by to-morrow every hungry
mouth in Texas would be looked after.
The waters are fast subsiding, and Gov
ernor Sayers !s confident that he will be
able to care 'or the poor of the State for
at least a week, after which time they
can secure employment in the flood
wrecked valley.
GALL INSECTS.
How They Make Material for Various
Inks and Dyes.
Oak apples, so called, are familiar ob
jects to almost every one, yet few under
stand their real nature. Many per
suppose them to be a port of fruity growth
of the tree on which they are found. Lie
sides the oak apples there are pimllar
swelling's and fruitlike growth?, some of
which are attached to twig? and are no
larger than cherries, while others grow
on leaves and are as large as a lien's egg,
hut of a more globular f'>rm. Some are
hard within, some soft hut woody In tex
ture; others are pithy or Bpongy, and still
others are nearly hollow, with strings or
fibers radiating from the center.
All kinds have In the middle a small.
h"!!<>\N\ pea-shaped or seedlike cell, which
contains the insect that is the real cause
of the growth. The irritation to the leaves
or twigs caused by these tiny insects
gives these abnormal growths the distinc
tive and appropriate name of 'Vails," by
which they have long been known.
<;nl! flies are among the must peculiar
of all the insect tribes. They belong to
the great order that includes the hees.
the wasps, the grnats and the ichneumon
flies, but they never sting or harm men '
or animals. The female gall fly. impelled
by the law of nature to provide for the ,
safety and welfare of her offspring, cuts
away the outer skin or hark of a leaf or
twig and deposits therein an egg. From
this is hatched a small white grub, with
out legs, but with a strong gnawlne
mouth. As it eats Its way into the sur
rounding tissue the plant Is seemingly in
vigorated, and begins to enlarge about the
tiny larvae and grow into a shape well
suited to its ne^ds as a place of conceal- !
meni and food supply. While all fli> - of
the same species develop galls ihat are
exactly alik.-. every species produces a
different form. Exactly why this Is so has
never been explained, yet we see parallel
instances everywhere in nature.
When the larva is full grown it is trans
formed in its narrow cell to a rey-e\ â¢â â !,
whitish pupa, helpless and almost motion
less, yet having rudimentary antennae,
legs and wings, which give promise of the
coming gail fly. This, in many species, is
a gayly colored insect, with red eyes,
more or less veined wings, a humped back
and an exceedingly long ovipositor. Thus
equipped it emerge? from fts confinement
and flies abroad, soon to deposit its egKs
In leaves and twigs and thus to cause
other galls.
Yet, strange to pay, the successive gen
erations of the same species differ widely
in appearance and even in color. From
galls made by tie spring brood are
hatched flies of the summer brood, whose
grubs winter in the Kails and produce the j
brood of the following spring. Not only ,
do thes- successive generations differ iii
appearance, but the summer brood con
sists of both sexes, while the spring brood
is <>f females only. In some specie!; one
brood is entirely black, while the follow
ing one is highly colored.
The blackberry has a gall fly which
gives exclusive attention to that plant,
and causes a hard swelling of the atrnis
filled with several cells each occupied by |
a grub. I think the Eight O'Clockers !
would find it interesting to gather some
of these curious galls, selecting those that
have turned brown, which shows that '
they have attained full growth. If they
are put into a receptacle that will admit
a little light and air, but will not allow
the gall fly to escape, the process of
hatching out may be observed, after
which the prisoner may be liberated. The
flies lire, often beautifully colored, some
with red and black bodies, others with
metallic green or blue reflections.
Oak galls are either spongy or woody.
The former are of no value to man. but
th. latter are largely used in the manu
facture of inks and dyes- This is due to !
the, fact that they contain a large per
centage of tannic acid, and when com
bined with certain salts of iron form
black, dark brown, or purple dyes, of ab
solutely permanent color. In our coun
try galls adapted to commercial purposes
cannot be found in sufficient quantities to
supply the demand. The galls exported i
from Aleppo, In Syria, are the most val
uable known for the manufacture of inks
and dyes. Ink used for important legal j
documents Is required, by the laws' of ]
England and France, to be made from
galls, such ink having proved to be prac
tically indelible.â Philadelphia Times.
FISHING IN SNOW.
A snow avalanche with very unusual
results is reported from Norway. It gave
the people of Christiania something to
talk about for a week. The unique phe
nomenon occurred among the low moun
tains back of the capital on March 31.
There had been an extraordinary fall of
â snow, and then came a big thaw, which
melted a great deal of the ice in the little |
Lilledal River. A very large number of ;
fish had their home in this stream, and :
What happened to them is the unusual
feature of this avalanche.
In the night a large mass of snow on
the hills on one side of the stream slipped
from the slopes and glided with great ve
lodty down into the river. The face of
the avalanche was about a mile in length
and for that distance it slid into the
river, not sharing the river bed with the
water, but violently ejecting the stream
and the iish living in it.
The force of that concussion must have '
been very great, for the water and fish
were hurled hundreds of feet. Next morn- '
ing the people were very much surprised
to find, high on the slopes of the hills
bordering the other side of the valley,
a great number of fish scattered over the
snow. For some days there was a most
unusual sort of fishing in progress. Men,
women and children were floundering
about in the snow gathering the fish in
baskets, and the people living along the
valley had all the fish they could eat
without baiting a hook.

WORK OF ART
That Was Too Natural to Please a
High-Toned Saloonist.
The trials of an artist are many and
sore, but one encountered recently by a
young New Yorker who earns a scanty
living -with his pencil and brush has its
ludicrous side also. Though his heart is
true to "art for art's sake," the exigen
cies of rent, clothes and food make neces
sary an occasional resort to trick paint
ing. at which he is clever; and a liquor
dealer who was about to open a new and
expensively decorated saloon gave him an j
order for "something that wjil put the
laugh on a fresh customer. Design,
size, etc., were left wholly to the artist;
price not to exceed $75; acceptance subject
to approval.
The artist cudgeled his brains for a
time, and then, procuring a small, rough
deal box, about twelve inches long arnl
six inches wide, spread his canvas on tue
inside of the bottom of it and painted
thereon about a half pint of broken pea
nut shells and a handful of pea
nuts. He executed the work so well that
when the box. which had no cover, was I
set on a table or bar and tilted back
against the wall temptation for a man
fond of peanuts to reach into the box for
one was almost irresistible, and the artist
tried the trick upon some of his own
friends with success before taking it to
the liquor dealer.
Up asked $G0 for it, and felt that the
money was as good as in his pocket, but
to his intense disgust the man of spirits
would not accept it, and when press id
for his reason would give no satisfactory
explanation. A friend of the artist, who
had thf confidence of the rumstller, un
dertook to find out.
"They were too natural altogether."
said the art patron, "and some of my
customers who do not care for peanuts,
seeing the i>i>x standing at the end of my
bar, might go away undeceived and think
I was selling peanuts. That would never
<1" Now, if it had been some rare trop
ical fruit, or even burned almonds, that
might do. but peanuts, never; not in this
high-toned place-^-tney are too cheap."--

The latest is the experience of Pri

Now his wound is healed and he stutters

BEKNARD SHAW ON CRITICISM.
On onp occasion when writing of honest
anri rlishonest dramatic criticism Bernard
Shaw the well-known London critic, re-
I markpd that "the respect inspired by good
i criticism is permanent, while the irrita
'' tinn it causes is temporary and the con
tempt it inspires is permanpnt." To this
rather striking phrase Mr. Shaw added
! the following expressions, which are well
worth reprinting:
The cardinal guarantee for a critic a
integrity is simply the force of the criti
! cal instinct itself. To try to prevent me
: from criticizing by pointing out to me the
< superior pecuniary advantages of pumng
' is like trying to keep a young Irving from
i going on the stage by pointing out the
Superior pecuniary advantages of stock
]'f my own father were an actor-man
-1 aper and his life depended on his getting
I favorable notices of his performances, I
should orphan myself without an in
! Â«=tant's hesitation if he acted badly. I am
i by no moans the willing victim of this
: instinct. T am keenly susceptible to con
trary Influencesâ to flattery, which 1 swaJ-
J low "greedily if the quality is sufficiently
Tgood- to thp need of money, to private
i friendship or even acquaintanceship, to
I the pleasure of giving pleasure and the
â  pain of giving pain, to considerations tor
i people's circumstances and prospects, to
personal likes and dislikes, to sentimental
ity, pity, chivalry, pugnacity and mis
chief, laziness and cowardice and a dozen
; other human conditions which make the
: critic vulnerable; but the critical instinct
gets the better of them alt. I spare no
. effort to mitigate its humanity, trying to
detect and strike out of my articles any
thing that would give pain without doing
any good Those who think the things I
say BeveYe or even malicious, should just
see the things I do not say. 1 dp my best
i to be partial, to hit out at remedial abuses
rather than at accidental shortcomings,
and at strong and responsible people rath
er than weak and helpless ones. And yet
â  all my efforts do not alter the result very
i much So stubborn is the critic within me
' that with every disposition to be as good
natured and as popular an authority us
i the worst enemy of art could desire. I am
to all intents and purposes incorruptible.
! And that is how the dramatist-critic, If
only he is critic enough, "slates" the
actor-manager in defiance of the interest
,he has in conciliating him. He cannot
: help himself any more than the ancient
1 mariner could help telling his story. And
1 the actor-manager can no more help lis
: tening than the wedding guest could. In
short the better formula would have been
: that 'a man is either a critic or not a
; critic" that to the extent to which he is
one he will criticize the managers in spite
i of heaven or earth, and that to the extent
to which he is not he will flatter them
i anyhow, to save himself trouble.
MARRIAGE CUSTOMS
In Norway That Seem Strange to the
- : : . â¢ Casual Visitor.
i Wedding presents in Norway are not of
the expensive but useless kind that they
are with us. Tiny consist of such things
as pots and pans,_* plates and dishes, a
feather bed, half a dozen sheep, a sack
of potatoes, etc. Sir G. W. Dasent says
that the Norwegians, in reference to mar
riage as to other things, put their best
foot foremost and try to make the most
of things generally. A lad went out to
woo a wife. Among other places he came
to a farmhouse â¢ where the people were
very poor, but they wanted to make him
think that they were well-to-do. Now
the father had got a new arm to his coat.
"Pray, take a seat," he said to the
wooer, "but there's a shocking dust in the
house." So he went about wiping all the
benches and tables with his new coat
sleeve, but he kept the other behind his
[back. The wife had one shoe much better j
than the other, and she went stamping
and sliding with it up against the stools'
and chairs, saying, "How untidy it is
here; everything" is out of its -place!"
Then they called out to their daughter to
come and put- things to rights, but she
had got a new cap. so she t>ut her head in
at the door and kept nodding and nod
ding, first to this side and then to that.
"Well, for my part,' she said, "I can't
be everywhere at once." In this way 'he
wooer was led to believe that he had come
to a well-to-do household. Many super
! stitions prevail in Sweden wit!
1 marriage. It is said that if a girl be fond
; of cats she will not be an old maid. ;is
I we should say, but have a hright day Cor
I her wedding. The Swedish bride somi -
! times wears a eoronei or myrtli . or, when
that is not procurable, of colored paper.
Here, as in Norway and other countries
of Northern Europe, then- is too much
eating and far too much drinking at v. â¢
: dings. In Sweden the repasts on th<
casions continue for hours. When asked
to take your place at the table it is con
. sidered polite to make as stout a reslst-
I ance as possible. During the repast a col
lection is made for the bride and some
â  times also for the poor of the parish. In
Siberia there is a good custom that a
bride, on coming to her husband's hous^,
i has to give a dinner prepared with her
I own hands as a test of t li* â  education she
has received. If she succeeds in gratify
! ing her guests it is taken as a proof not
only of the young woman's own cx
i cell'ence, but also as a recommendation of
j her whole family by whom she was ln
j structed so usefully. â Cassell's Magazine.
In lie proceedings of the Royal Insti
tute of Lombardy Signor Angelo An
dres deals with the Interpretation of
death among the lower animals. The
writer starts with the conception that
living organic matter docs not in itself
possess any reason for dying, and that,
on the other hand, this reason pertains
to single individuals; In other words,
that living matter remains in itself im
mortal and that only the modality of
the individual dies.

OF THE BELVEDERE DROUGHT
o T is remarkable, hut It Is none the
less true. It is hard to account for,
j| but still it is. No one will credit
<Li It. yet It is a fact, substantiated
beyond the peradventure of a
dnubt. The fierce hill tribes that In
habit the mountain fastnesses of Bel
yclept the "beautiful" by those
who own land there which they desire
to dispose of â are sore because they
have no fresh water.
Do they miss it as a beverage? No.
of course not. Who ever heard of a
Marin County aborigine drinking
water when there was anything else
in sight? But they need it for a va
riety of other purposes, and there is
none in sight. That is, there is none
nearer than the railway tank at the
ferry landing, and that is a long way
to go for a canful when one wishes to
h the flowers that ornament
front porch. Consequently Bel
vedere Is dead sore and the proud flesh
is hourly becoming more sensitive.
Some one must be to blame. Some one
is. Thst some one is John Coop, su
perintendent of the Belvedere Land
Company. -Why John Is to blame no
one seefns to know exactly. But, as
whenever a great misfortune visits a
locality, some one has to be the scape
goat, and as John doesn't seem to
worry himself much about the matter
either one way or the other, why. John
might just as well be chosen to bear
the blame as any other goat on the
hillside.
The Belvedere Land Company has a
franchise granted it by the hamlet of
Belvedere, which the public-spirited
citizens residing therein incorporated
into a city some time ago. Why the
Land Company should have a fran
chise of any sort no one seems to
know. But as soon as the little place
across the bay began to put on the
Btyle of a metropolis it was necessary
to grant some sort of a franchise to

NOW IT'S A REWARD
FOR PRETTY AH MOY
THE trial? and tribulations of Ah
Moy, the pretty Chinese maiden
who was ruthlessly torn from
the protecting arms of her
frlon'ls about two weeks ago by
Wong Chuck Hlng, may never be
told, but that the friends of the girl
are anxious for her recovery is evi
denced by the degree of excitement
that rages in the Chinese quarter of
the city.
Fong Fat, who claims to ho the near
est friend of the girl, has exhausted
every resource known to the police
and detective force of the city and has
now come to the conclusion that the
best way to regain the girl is through
the cupidity of man, and he has sent
forth word that any one who brings
the girl to him at his place of business,
1116 Stockton strr-ft. will be rewarded
to the extent of 1300.
That Fong Fat has at last arrived
at the correct mode of procedure is
evidence", by the activity that is be
ing displayed by the men who make
their living by deeds of daring. The
highbinder tongs will now .try to do
that which the police force gave up
in despair.
When Ah Moy was taken away it
was given out by the friends of the kidnaper that the girl went -willingly and
was to be the wife of Wong Chuck. Hing. Later developments, however. Indi
cate that it was a clear case of kidnaping-, and now the friends of the girl
are determined that she shall be recovered, for they are assured that the
sole Intent of taking away the maiden was to compel her to lead a life of
slavery. For.g Fat. who represents the girl's family in the matter, says that
since the proper authorities cannot aid them in getting the girl away from her
abductors he will give the sum of $300 to any one who returns her to him.

Letters From Central America Which
Portray a Scene of Confusion
and Demoralization in All
Walks of Life.
From private advices received in this
city last night from San Jose de Guate
mala it appears that that unfortunate
country is agrain In the throes of
internecine war, or something' very much
resembling war. The mercantile con
fidence of the community has been so
shaken that business is practically at a
standstill and. exchange has reached the
enormous premium of 500 on United States
gold.
The cause for all this seems to be the
desire of the new President, Estrada Ca
brera, to call in enough gold to redeem
the six millions of worthless paper cur
rency which he issued some time ago. Th<?
methods he is pursuing to acquire this
immense sum are peculiarly those of the
average Central American President.
Picking out those of hiÃ countryman of
known wealth or great financial r>axking\
he proposes that they lend him a certain
sum on what he tells them is good se
curity. The penalty of refusal Is death
or confiscation of their estates, the pen
alty being exacted on some trumped up
charge or other.
Naturally such procedure is not con
ducive to much confidence in the Justice
of the government and only one re. suit
can ensueâ anarchy and general demorali
zation of both social, business and orncial
life.
[Â£ the advices received last night are
correct this result seems to have already
been obtained.

FRASER RIVER SALMON
PACK IS A FAILURE
Deplorable Condition Caused by the
Laws Barring American
Fishermen.
VANCOUVER, July B.â With abouc the
largest salmon run that has ever been
known In the history of canning on the
Fraser River, this year's pack is likely
to be a failure. The :ish are running in
thousands up the Fraser. yet the scarcity
of men is making- it a practical impossi
bility for the canneries to put up a puck
that will pay them.
A. E. Tregent, a prominent car.ner. said i
to-day that there were 50.000 cases of i
empty tins in some of the canneries, and |
he would wager that not 10.000 wouid be ;
rilled. Usually at this tim<*"of year there
are thousands of boats on the river, but |
the regulations this year precluded Amor- i
icans from lishlng. Tregent says that
yesterday he went through all the fishiujj
community and only .'WO boats were out.
Of these only two wore manned by v.-hitc
men. others being manned by Japanese,
Italians and Indians.
"No one would argue the point.' he
said, "as to which are preferable. Ameri
cans or foreigners." The new law made to
legislate against Americans has simply
brought in a great influx of Oriental*!,
who are really taking the market from
the Canadians themselves, and although
they cannot speak English they say they
are all British subjects."

CLERK LEROY M'ELROY
CAPTURED IN CHICAGO
Confesses That He Stole the Dia-
monds of Mrs. Felt and Mrs.
Hale, and Will Be Returned.
CHICAGO. July B.â Leroy McÃlroy,
formerly clerk in the Richelieu Hotel at
San Francisco, was arrested here to-day
on a charge of stealing $5000 worth of dia
monds from Mrs. Felt and Mrs. Hale of
Boston, who were guests at the hotel. He
acknowledges his guilt and will be sent to
San Francisco for trial.
Mr?. Felt and Mrs. Hale, after their ar
rival in this city, rented apartments in
the Richelieu. In one of their trunks
were stored the precious gems. At the
invitation of one of their friends they took
a trip to the interior, and on their re
turn found that their trunks had been
broken open during their absence and
their diamonds stolen. They at once com
municated with Chief Lees, who detailed
Detectives Dinan and Wren to arrest the
thief. The detectives visited the hotel,
and after a thorough investigation be
came convinced that Clerk McElroy was
the culprit. The latter, evidently fearing
arrest, suddenly left the city and was
finally traced to Chicago. Shortly after
Ms disappearance McElroy wrote to a
relative -in Oakland, asking him to send
the box which had contained the dia
monds to 10 South park. Chicago. The
letter was turned over to Chief Lees, who
telegraphed to the police of Chicago, in
structing them to keep a strict watch for
McElroy, with the result that he was ar
rested.
JUDGMEMT AGAINST
SMALL STOCKHOLDERS
Union Bank Depositors Score Their
First Victory in the
Courts.
SAX JOSE, July S.â Judgment was
given against eighty stockholders of
the Union Savings Bank to-day by Jus
tice Wallace in the suit brought by C.
W. Childs and other depositors to re
cover the pro rata liability of the for
mer. The judgment was given for
$14 35 a share, with interest at 7 per
cent. There are 60S shares of stock rep
resented by the eighty defendants, who
were all small shareholders. The judg
ment was given with a reduction of ?
a share on portions of the accounts be
cause of their having run the statute
of limitations. The total amount of the
judgment recovered is $6728 80.
Four hundred depositors were repre
sented in the suit, with accounts ag
gregating $160,000. The stockholders
sued heid tess than eighteen shares
each.
This is the first judgment against
stockholders of the Union Savings
Bank. There are two suits pending in
the Superior Court against the large
stockholders. An appeal probably will
be taken from the decision, but Attor
ney Welch, who represents the deposit
ors, is confident of winning in the
higher court.
The stockholders are not paying the
510 assessment recently levied by the
directors and the bank's attorneys will
begin suits for its collection in a few
days.
Divorced Because of Desertion.
SAX ANDREAS. July S.â The Allison
divorce case came up ' in the Superior
Court of Calaveras County to-day before
Judge Gottschalk. Rachael Allison applied
for a divorce from her husband. Robert S.
Allison. Allison brought a cross-complaint
charging his wife with desertion. Alli
son lives at Robinsons Ferry, about lif
teen miles from San Andreas, and is a
miner in the employ of the Melones Min
ing Company. His wife has been living
in Stockton apart from him this year.
Rather than have their 'family troubles
aired In court, the attorney for Mrs. Alli
son consented to a divorce being granted
to Allison on the cross-complaint, while
the child was slven to the mother.

UNIVERSITY FEES.
INHERE are two sides to the fee question. While
it is true that a fee is felt as a burden by many
parents who are seeking higher education for
their children, it is aNo true that there are other bur
dens imposed by life at a university which are less tol
eiable.
These are the more difficult to deal with because
they rank with social exactions and the expense of
imitation. The student whose finances make the fee
a consideration is in more important ways subjected
to the compefition of the student to whom the :ee is
of no importance at all.
The rich man's ->>ii or daughter, followed by pa
rental affection to the university, is supported there
in a style that marks a class distinction, and very often
fills the college days of others with discontent be
cause they have not the means to live in equal style.
Though they cannot hope to reach the state of their
rich companions, the effort to do so adds numerous
txpen-es to the list of their needs, and in the course
of a term these amount to far more than the fees.
X 1 -. i s matter has long been gravely considered at
-Yale and Harvard In those old colleges there have
been - -ho had thousands to spend, ami spent
them every term. The poorer students were the re
cipient* of their hospitality and shared the. pleasures
procured ! ;â  lavish expenditure, only to pay for pass
ing enjoyment in the humiliation of feeling that they
irn in kind the attention they had ac
cepted, and in the acquisition of expensive habits
which their parents had not the means to support.
The evil lias been long apparent. The remedy is
net easy to apply. It is not every boy that has the
self denial and courage to resist temptation and good
fellowship and stay in the plain way of his fathers.
So there come to ambitious parents great and heart
trying disappointments. Hopes invested in the edu
cation of sons are brought to naught by the habits
picked up at college, and the loss of the hard-earned
money is the least of the misfortunes which fall as
the result of contacts with the lavish expenditure of
the rich. As a reform it has been proposed to bring
all living at a university down to one scale, laid along
the line of the average financial ability of the people
from whose ranks the student .material is drawn.
This, perhaps, is all that the governors of any univer
sity can do in the matter. An efficient reform lies
vith the people themselves. A rich girl was to gradu
ate from Y.-issar in a class that had many students
who were poor and could afford no display. Moved
by the highest refinement of good taste and good
sense, the rich girl dressed for graduation in the
simplest and least expensive of costumes, so that none
of her companions need be tempted to do what they
could not afford, and none might have to flinch at
a contrast to their disadvantage. After all, the spirit
of that rich girl must be looked to for the relief of
university life from one of the greatest burdens it
puts upon the poor.
Believers in the doctrine of heredity will find much
to comfort them in a study of the genealogical tree
a Brooklyn namesake of ttie new pugilistic champion
lias prepared for Jim Jeffries. It proves, if it proves
an3-thing, that the boilermaker comes rightly by his
fistic honors. One of his ancestors with William the
Conqueror undoubtedly whipped one of Fite's fore
fathers at the battle of Hastings.
Boss Buckley is desirous of having an organization
in this city similar to Tammany. As there is only one
tiger, Buckley will be forced to use such of his lieu
tenants as are accustomed to wearing stripes as the
emblems of the machine.
It is reported that the floods in Texas have de
stroyed the big cotton crop of that State. All-wool
clothing will be higher next season.
"Fighting" Joe Wheeler will be in San Francisco
before the end of a week. It is needless to say he will
get a real California welcome.
It is safe to say that the advocates of anti-kissing
are in an overwhelming majority when the kissing
bug is around.
ENCOURAGEMENT FOR REPUBLICANS
IT seems almost certain that the attempt of the
Huntington-Herrin-Burns-Kelh-Crimruins com
bination to spread a wet blanket over the Re
publican organization in San Francisco wrtl fail.
Never has there been an effort to destroy a great party
I that involved more supreme rascality. ' San Fran
cisco, owing to the power and dishonesty of the Hun
tington monopoly, has been noted for unique politi- j
cal phenomena. But the deliberate proposal, through !
I the regular County Committee of the Republican |
i party, to ratify and confirm all the treacheries and ;
j frauds for which the Kentucky corporation has stood ;
as the sponsor during the past year easily transcends :
' all former experiences.
The conditions that force a great American com
i munity almost to remain sleepless in order to save its '
; own life have become virtually intolerable. No matter
j what the fundamental political .differences in the
j United States may be, it will be generally admitted :
| that the Republican party originated in brains, in
I character and in independence. The men who founded
; the party were Americans, and, rather than sacrifice
! a principle, they would have blown an organization
into splinters. They did not belong to the class of
; stereotyped partisans who could be forced through !
(he grooves of a machine and labeled with some dis- j
i gusting mark of surrender to corruption. Abraham '
j Lincoln, Hannibal Hamlin, Salmon P. Chase, Wil
; Ham H. Seward, and their great contemporaries, were ;
unprepared for the genuflections and the adulation ;
that could alone have produced the literary efrlores- i
cence of the Colton letters, in which Collis P. Hun- \
| tington signally illustrated his grammatical insuffi
-1 ciency and his rude conception of a dictatorship.
Republican independence, which has been a steady
! element in party history, survives to-day and propqses
' to become regnant in San Francisco and to defeat
; the Huntington trade with the fusion Democracy. It
is very doubtful whether the blanket ticket does not |
violate both the letter and the spirit of the primary
election law. Upon that point some premonitory
observations have been made by the City and County
I Attorney and by others that are full of point and im
pressive in their application. But, independently of
the purely legal aspects of the case, which may prob
ably dispose of the whole matter, the Republicans who
control the results of elections are displaying an or- â .
I ganized activity of which the lluntington-Herrin-
Burns-Kelly-Crimmins combination had better take
j notice. Of course, in view of the representative
principle that has been dogmatically violated by the
Republican County Committee, the best thing that
can happen is a ruling against the right to present a
! Huntington placard of 306 delegates to a municipal -
j convention from eighteen Assembly districts. But '
whether this ruling can be obtained or not, the Re- !
: publican voters of San Francisco have evidenced their t
j intention to control their own party. There are two
â  organization?, fully described in our local columns,
I which, though operating on different lines, concur in
* their objects. If a blanket ticket is tolerated â in other
I words, if the primary election is construed by monop
olistic interpreters â they will face the corporations
with tickets of their own. and it is by no means im
possible that tlie blanketed underbreds may be beaten
at their own game. All that is needed to overcome 1
the Phelan auxiliary to the traitors to Republican
principles and to Republican integrity is a represen
tative convention. The present indications are that
such an aggregation of intelligence, of conservatism
and of American manhood may be secured.
One thing is certain: No railroad ticket can be
I elected. For that proposition The Call and some of I
\ its contemporaries will be responsible. With no un-
I dercurrent of selfishness, with no personal objects to !
be subserved, with a fixed purpose to combine the
decent political elements of this community in a tri- i
umphant vindication of principle and *of character.
The Call feels assured that failure is impossible. This
is an American city and it is to be governed by Araer
icans, and not by imperialistic methods.
THE ELDER BROTHERHOOD.
WHEN euphemistic sentiments in favor of the
British influence in the incidents in Samoa
were floating through the American press The
Call, while not ignoring any rational cause for re
ciprocal aid arising from the facts coexisting in the
United States and in Great Britain, nevertheless re
j.tated the' warning of Washington against "entan
gling alliances." and urged the retention of an
American policy, based upon our own constitutional
system of government. Among other things it directed
popular attention to the fact that there might be two
sides to the Samoan events, and it failed to accept
the description of those events so industriously cir
culated by the Associated Pre-s.
Our precautions have been more than justified by
the light that from many quarters has recently
streamed upon Samoa, and not only upon Samoa but
upon other regions of the earth where Great Britain
has sought to obliterate the results of our Revolu
tionary War. The detailed reports that have lately
appeared in our columns have done much to
correct the errors of the earlier accounts of the Sa
moan controversy and to confirm the views of Mr.
Lloyd Osborne, who was so long the representative
of the United States in those islands. The design of
Great Britain to establish an elder brotherhood, that
would have the effect of swamping the fundamental
ideas of our national system and of reducing us to a
position in an imperialistic association,
has been most thoroughly exposed.
Our interests in Samoa were small. British in
fluence endeavored to control us and temporarily suc
ceeded, 'out, when the protectorate over the Tonga |
Island? was offered, the United States were not in- |
eluded in that deal. This, however, is comparatively
a small matter. The larger proposition is. the effort
to seduce or to entice us into the imperialistic policy
of Great Britain, of which our own unpatriotic press i
is furnishing evidences day by day. It is only a short
time ago since the London School of Tropical j
Medicine had its annual convocation in the British i
metropolis, which no less a man than Mr. Chamber
lain referred to as one of the modes of promoting an
imperialistic policy, in which the trans-Atlantic
brethren of the British people were expected to join.
Among other facts prominently mentioned in that
convocation was the inclusion of three hundred mil
lions of "colored people" within the British empire.
This is the imperial combination of which the United I
States is to form a part, and it is this domination of I
the inferior races of the world in which our republic. ;
with its elaborate protection of individual rights and
of the sovereignty of man, is expected to participate.
Amicable relations with Great Britain, the closest
association and co-operation not only with that em
pire, but with Germany, so deeply represented in our
population, with the French republic associated with
us by hereditary ties, and with every aspiring aggre
gation of human beings to be found upon the earth.
are fundamental ideas in American civilization. But ;
to be absorbed by the nation from which we wrested j
our independence, to be drawn into a governmental !
doctrine from which we extricated ourselves by force, |

advanced ideas of the human race, after its inherent
supremacy has been established by a hundred and
twenty-three years of history, is not within the com
pass of American intention. The late celebration of
our national anniversary, however marred by occa
sional appeals to the imperial instinct, conclusively
answered the assumptions of our retrogression and
the intolerable pretensions of expatriated specu
lators.
In a recent number of the Preussische Tahrbucher
Professor Delbruck based a calculation on our finan
cial propensities: "The present imperialistic craze
need not deceive us. The Americans have to pay
three, six, even ten, dollars for what we get for one.
Wait until they have to foot the bill."
In this proposition there is an element of truth. But
it is very slight and grossly underestimates the Ameri
can people. The higher ground upon which all im
perialistic alliances will be rejected and the nation
swung back to its constitutional moorings is the
foundation upon which our Government rests and
our saturated belief and confidence in the principles of
the Declaration of Independence, which are coinci
dent with the sovereignty of man and intolerably re
pugnant to monarchy and to every form of despotism.
THE EPWORTH LEAGUE CONVENTION.
i"\ N'E of the most notable gatherings to assemble
J in the year 1901 will be the great international
convention of the Epworth League. The
c at which the convention is to be called has not
been determined, and some of the more active
nbers in California have already arranged to
cc a strong effort to induce the league to select
Francisco as the site for the assembly.
he enterprise is one to which all citizens of in
nce ought to give cordial assistance and help.
: Epworth League is among the foremost of the
many organizations which have been recently formed
among young men and women to aid 'in church
work. Its members are to be found in every land
under the sun, and in our own country constitute a
powerful as well as a numerous and rapidly increasing
body. The international gathering of the league will
bring together thousands of delegates and visitors,
and to the city where the convention is held the en
tertainment of so notable and so large an assemblage
of earnest young men and women from all parts of
the world will be most profitable in every respect.
To those who take no thought of to-morrow 1901
seems far distant. Intelligent people, however, well
understand the value of assuring future as well as
present good. The selection of the place for the
league convention is to be made within a time com
paratively short. The committee that will present the
claims of San Francisco will leave for Indianapolis
1 on the 12th, so that it will be seen there is no time to
. lose in providing the members with whatever aid is
possible in the work that lies before them.
While San Francisco is remote from the great cen
ters of population, and to that extent is handicapped
in its efforts to become a convention city, it has many
advantages to counterbalance the disadvantage of
situation. Conventions are held in the summer time,
and this city has the pleasantest dimmer climate in
America, if not in the world. Crowded convention
halls with us are never sweltering with heat; there is
no debilitation, no danger of prostration from ex
haustion caused by work in overheated rooms. That
fact alone counts much in our favor, and would be in
itself almost sufficient to make this the most frequent
convention city in the Union, if it were better under
stood by the people of the East.
The attendance at the convention is sure to be
large, but we have ample accommodation for all who
may come. No city in the world knows better how
to entertain visitors than San Francisco, and none is
more hospitable in doing it. The attractiveness of
the surroundings make the city, moreover, one of the
he-t pleasure resorts on the continent, and the dele
gates who come here to attend to convention business
will find it a place for a delightful holiday after the
work is over. Strong arguments, therefore, can be
presented to the league in favor of this city as the site
for its international gathering, and it is to be hoped
the committee that goes to present our claims will
have ample backing in their undertaking.
INDUSTRIAL ALfIRM IN ENGLAND.
l~> RITISII manufacturers have 3ent to this coun
\\ try a representative to study our industrial con
ditions and to find out how it is that American
firms have been able to obtain contracts to supply
locomotives for British railways and steel bridges for
ronds in Egypt and in India. Evidently something of
alarm is felt by the manufacturers of the old country.
The industries fostered by protection in the United
Slates have become formidable competitors for the in
dustries of free trade even in the home of free trade.
The alarm is not confined to the manufacturing
class only. British merchants have long since per
ceived that their commerce is losing ground under
the stress of German activity in commercial ventures,
and British ship-builders are noting with something
of uneasiness that German ships are now being con
structed in German shipyards instead of in those of
Great Britain. Thus with American industrial com
petition on the one hand and German commercial
competition on the other, the outlook does not prom
ise any long continuance of the present supremacy of
Great Britain in the commerce of the world. â¢
There is another phase of the subject that causes
despondency in the United Kingdom. The amount of
coal and iron available for industrial use is rapidly
diminishing, and experts are predicting that within a
time comparatively short Great Britain will be de
pendent upon the United States tor her supply of
those articles. That will imply a complete industrial
and commercial dependence upon this country. Nor
does there appear any means by which, the coming
dependence can be averted. Indeed, if a prolonged
war against powerful foes should come upon her
Great Britain might be compelled to become some
thing like a political dependency, as without our aid
she could not obtain the coal and the iron necessary
for her fleets.
The United Christian Party of America intends to
enter the national political campaign with a Presiden
tial candidate, and a platform reading, "What Would
Jesus Do?" There are some questions that involve
the paradox of a self-evident but unexpected answer.
Perhaps the United Christian Party of America
wouldn't like to hear the answer of most Americans
to the query of the new platform.
There seems to be a disposition in the Fourth of
July Committee to "whitewash" T. P. Robinson, the
discredited and expelled grafter of the committee.
Whitewash will accomplish little more than to make
more prominent the black spots on Robinson's hide.
The leading characters in the local domestic com
edy, which seems to have been inspired by the Botkin
tragedy, demonstrate, that the race of fools is not by
any means becoming extinct.
The Spanish have just acquitted Admiral Cervera.

EDITORIAL VARIATIONS.
BY JOHN McNfIUGHT.
So thoroughly has Kipling impressed
himself upon the popular mind that
critics of all s.:zes have begun to use
him as a convenient standard by which
to measure every new aspirant or ama
teui in thf field of letters. Some critics
use Rudyard as a model of excellence,
and when they desire to praise an au
thor they say his style is suggestive of
Kipling's. Others take him as a warn
ing of the depravity to which litera
ture can sink, and when in their turn
they seek to praise a writer they hold
him up as a contrast to that creature
of abomination.
As a result of this condition of the
casual criticism of our day, the reader
must know what a critic thinks of Kip
ling before he can derive any satisfac
tion from his criticisms. For example,
an Eastern critic in reviewing that
most delightful little Californian book,
"Sugar Pine Murmurings," compared
the style to that of Kipling, and proba
bly intended it as a recommendation tf>
the public; but it is by no means cerÂ»
tain it will be so regarded.
George Moore, a critic of reDUte in
London town, is one who would got
read "Sugar Pine Murmurings," if he
believed the critic who said it suggests
Kipling, for Moore looks upon the
rough and ready Rudyard as the liter
ary offspring of all the coarseness of
British insolence flushed by the lust of
empire. He is quoted by the London
Chronicle as having said recently:
"Mr. Kipling, the poet that England
was now celebrating, would not hayÂ»
written the most hideous verses ever
written in a beautiful language if he
had not lived in a specially hideous mo
ment, the moment of the African mil
lionaire, when England, gorged with
wealth, lus-ted for more, whe.n thou
sands of Arabs were phot in the desert
with machine guns â and the general
who commanded in these shambles was
greeted as a hero. In no other circum
stances but the present would Mr. Kip
ling have been a disgraceful blot on
the most beautiful poetic record in the
world."
â¢ â¢ â¢
"Sugar Pine Murmurings," being a
product of the native wit of Califor
nia, should be. studied in the atmos
phere- <>f th" sunny land in which it was
evolved, and not be mixed up with th*
disputations of British fog land. I
have lugged it in only to show
just how far and how foolishly
these Kipling comparisons are car
ried. The speech of Mr. Moore is
the point I am leading up to lazily, a*
befits a day of rest, for that doughty
pen fighter did not denounce Kipling
for the mere fun of denouncing him,
but for the purpose of lauding another
man â a genius of whem we know little,
but of whom, according to Mr. Moore,
',>.â¢â¢ ought t'> know much; of whom we
will know much when a literary sanity
returns to us, and "the Rudyards cease
from Kipling and the Haggards ride
no more."
In Dublin, "the finest city upon the
pay," a number of patriot? of light and
leading have established a "literary
theater" for the encouragement of Irish
genius, and the genius has come. The
dramatic work of a certain Mr. Teat?,
produced at the theater, has cause?
something of a sensation in the United
Kingdom, pride in Ireland and enthu
siasm in the mind of Mr. Moore. At a
banquet given a short time ago to cele
brate the success of the theater, Moore
and Max Beerbohm wore distinguished
guests, and Moore made an address, in
the course of which he said the works
of Mr. Yeats were not as yet, and prob
ably never would be, as voluminous as
those of either Shakespeare or Victor
Hugo, but he could not admit that they
More less perfect. In the art of writing
a blank verse play none except Shake
speare and Mr. Yeats had succeeded.
We must not be afraid of praising Mr.
Yeats' poetry too much; we must not
hesitate to say that there were lyrics
in the collected poems as beautiful as
any in the world.
Here, then, on the authority of a
critic of high repute, we hayÂ« the state
ment that a dramatic writer of trans
cendent genius has arisen in Ireland.
U'hich of our managers of theaters will
be first to reproduce one of his plays in
San Francisco and give us an oppor
tunity to learn what Dublin is doing
for the elevation of the stage and tho
redemption of literature?
What we need in this country is not
so much a redemption of literature as
a wholesale damnation of all critics
outside of California. There be not so
many as ten worthy fellows in the
whole Eastern lot, and they that be
worthy have n<'t virtue enough to
leaven the lump. The quality of the
stuff which under the title and in the
form of criticism is poured forth from
the pets of publishers into the long
ears of the Eastern public may be
judged from the statement of Charles
Johnson, a critic plenipotentiary of
New England, that Mark Twain is "the
greatest writer the New World has yet
seen."
Such a statement expressed as seri
ous criticism is offensive to patriotism,
and moreover is a wholly unnecessary
offense. It implies that while the Xew
World has seen no greater writer than
the author of "Tom Sawyer," the < >ld
V.'orfd has seen greater, and carries
with it the inference that the Old World
has seen more fine sights than ours
has seen. Now, as a matter of fact, if
Mark Twain be greater than H.iw
thorne and Poe and Emerson, then also
is he by an equal ease of assertion
srroater than Shakespeare, Goethe,
Dante, the man who wrote the book of
.lob and the woman who compiled the
Arabian Nights Entertainments. Mr.
Johnson should have said Mark Twain
is the greatest writer the whole world
has yet seen, and then it would not
have been put upon anybody to take
the trouble to write him down an ass.
When Parah Bernhardt undertook to
play "Hamlet," it was a foregone con
clusion we were to have a new Hamlet,
but no one expected it to be "fresh."
Hence there has been more of a sensa
tion in London over the Bernhardt
Hamlet than ever there was over the
theory of a Baconian Shakespeare.
If there be anything on which all
British and all American critics agree,
it is that we understand everything
about Hamlet, except the one point
whether or no he were mad. There is
a dispute concerning the madness, but
on all else there is such harmony as
reigns in heaven. By critics, commen
tators and actors all, it has been
treated as a self-evident fact that
Hamlet was of a reflective disposition,
a doubtful, hesitating youth; one who
did not know whether he loved Ophe
lia or did not love her; who was not
sure whether he ought to kill himself
or somebody else; one whose native hue
of resolution was always sicklied o'er
by a pale oast of thought, and whose
enterprises of great pith and moment
turned awry and lost the name of ac
tion.
Sarah says Hamlet was not that kind
of man at all. She insists he was a
crafty, resolute, determined schemer
like Richard III; hesitating at noth
ing, but sacrificing everything to the
one object he had In viewâ that of re
venge for his father's death.
So peculiar does the Bernhardt preÂ»
sentation of the melancholy Dane ap
pear to the London critics that one
among them declares it to be an origi
nal creation, born not of Shakespeare's
brain, but of Bernhardt's nerve; and
he suggests that the new thing on the
stage be advertised as "The Princess
of Denmark."
â¢ â¢ â¢
For all that Sarah Bernhardt Is a
great genius and a new Hamlet, she is
none the less a woman and has a wo
man's ways. She Insists on the last
word, and he who would deprive her
of it must talk long and talk fast. She
has replied to her critics and showr
herself to be a commentator as well as
an uncommon actor. At any rate, she
is not a "'crushed tragedian" by any
means. Her letter on the subject of
Hamlet's character Is too long to be
quoted in full, but it is only fair to give
at least something of what the creator
of a resolute Hamlet has to say for
herself and her latest new thing in the
drama.
After reviewing the incidents of thÂ«
play and explaining how they reveal
the true nature of Hamlet, she says:
"As soon as he gathers what is in his*
father's mind and learns of his mur
der, he forms the resolution to avenge
him; but as he is the opposite of i
Othello â who acts first and thinks
afterwardâ Hamlet thinks before h& i
acts, which is proof of great strength j
and great power of mind.
"Hamlet loves Ophelia! He renounces !
his love! He renounces study! He reÂ» :
nounces everything in order to gain his
object. And he attains it. He kills thÂ» ,
King while in the blackest and most '
mortal sin; but he kills him only whet*
he is absolutely sure.
"When he is sent to England he takes
the first opportunity of leaping alone
into an enemy's vessel, and announces
his fame that he may be made pris
oner, certain that he will be broughi
back. He calmly sends Rosencrantz
and Guildenstern to death. All this be
speaks a young, strong and determined
character.
"When he dreams. It is of his plan â of
his vengeance. If God had not forbid
den suicide he would have killed him
self in disgust of the world. .But since
he cannot kill himself, he will kill!"
If that be not Shakespeare's Hamlet,
so much the worse for Shakespeare.
Bernhardt will steal the character from
him and make it anew even as he stole
it from some forgotten playwright and
made it to suit his own notion. It is
clear the divine Sarah is every inch a
woman. She will have nothing to do
with hesitating men; or if she becomes
interested in one who has been doubtful
and irresolute, she will instill resolu
tion into him. Whatever be the char
acter she plays, or the man she plays
with, there is sure to be some snap to
him before she gets through with him.
For the rest â there is no reason why
we should complain of her attempt to
overthrow the conventional Hamlet.
Sarah -will soon pass and there will
never be another, but the old Hamlet
will live like the chestnut tree for a
thousand years.

To the Association of American Ag
ricultural Colleges and Experiment
Stations in convention assembled in
this city, there came on the day of the
opening session this telegram: . .
TRAER, lowa. July 5. 1599.
Dr. A. C. True. San Francisco, Cal.: To
the Association of Colleges and Station*,
greetings. From Bea to sea we hail the
workers of ever}' land as brother? and put
our shoulders under their yokes, that
knowledge may increase and plenty rule ]
in all our borders.
JAMES WILSON.
Secretary of Agriculture.
The Beauties of the sentiment ex
pressed in that telegram are many, and
it may be added they are mysterious.
The "we" ' who from sea to sea i
hail the -workers of every land as
brothers are doubtless the agricultur
ists, but just why a farmer should
talk of increasing knowledge and es- I
tablishing the rule of plenty by put- j
ting his shoulder to the yoke of his '
brother is not clear, for the average j
farmer knows that to get a move on a j
stalled wagon the proper way is to put !
a shoulder to the wheel of the vehicle,
and not to the yoke of the beast that
draws it.
It is possible that Secretary "Wilson
In becoming a Cabinet officer laid aside
his- bucolic ox sense when he picked up
the language of official station, but the
chances are the explanation of the
mysteriousness of the telegram is to be
found in the date. When a thing is
written on the day after the Glorious
Fourth, it is not to be critized too close
ly. On that day anything goes so long
as It means well.
From the revelers who in these happy
summer days, straying from the busy i
haunts of care and strife where men
earn money, have gone to the romantic
regions where one can do nothing but
spend it and time, there come strange
stpries. One of these wanderers claims
to have discovered a sort of earthly
Nirvana, a town where the weary cease
from troubling and even the wicked
take a restâ a place where the balm of
Gilead is infused in the very atxnos
phere. The wanderer from the metro
polis, and perhaps from the truth, de
scribes the place as â
-'a dim city lying alone
Far down in the dim west,
Where the good and the bad and the
worst and the best
Have gone to their eternal rest.
The discoverer avers with much as
severation the place is not a. graveyard
nor a crematory, but a city where peo
ple are alive enough to breathe and
have thirsts enough to cause a demand
for drinks. Saloons exist in the com
munity, but they are not hilarious. The
explorer says: "I was in a saloon last
night in which a big phonograph ren
dered 'Nearer, My God, to Thee 1 and
'Where Is My Wandering Boy To-
Night?"'
. There may be people who doubt the
existence in California of a town where
revelers in saloons find their joy In llsÂ»
tening to hymns and temperance songs
of tender sentiment, but I am indiffer-.
ent to the incredulous, as the wan
derer who tells the story is indifferent
to truth. The names of the city and
of the county could be given as an evi
dence of good faith, but that would be
advertising. The story is big enough
to stand alone, and it will have to do so.

"A MIDNIGHT

o r â  -jIS a good thing to be given abad

makes us appreciate our ordinary
living. If all plays -were well
Â£b presented we should never know
the joy of leaving in the middle of the
i last act and getting out under the stars.
â  Sir Walter Scott confessed that he never
'â¢ could repeat a story without giving it a
, new hat and cane.
The perpetrators of "A Midnight Bell
I have been still more liberal. In their
I hands it has become the medium for reci
tation and coon specialties and is less at
â¢ tractive than tilled cheese. The New Eng
i land atmosphere that is the play makes
a half-hearted effort to be present, finds
; nothing to stand upon and falls, like
I Nineveh, never to rise again. I once had
'. a liberal faith in the play. It had stood
i the test of friendship. But last night I'
had an awakening and my thoughts took
I shape in this wise: "Time does many
! thingsâ it ripens green fruit. It also
! makes it mtten." With the exception of
. Mr. Stockwell there is not a Yankee on

I If I had time I could write a book about

! will certainly never tire of good works
j for he will never do anything to fatigue
! himself. He walks through his part w. i
I a most exasperating air of conscious vir
i tue. In the matter of prayer he gives
"one the impression that he might at a
i pinch go through some mechanical sup-
I plication in a selected Delsarte poise war
ranted not to ruffle the sublimity of his
self-esteem or the puffs in his hair. He
i has many an unpretentious virtue, but
' they are swamped in his air of compla

SHf-iiig Francis Yale as Lorenzo in the
"Merchant of Venice." He was splrituel

Miss Pearl Landers, though missing the

Steamer Departs.
INSANE JAPANESE SENT HOME
OREGON BOYS WILL NOT BE
GIVEN LUNCHEON.
Nothing Certain About the Arrival of
the Regiment â The Steamer Del
Norte Gets In From
Dutch Harbor.
The Toyo Kisen Kaisha's steamer Nip
pon Maru sailed for the Orient yesterday, i
Evprj' ounce of cargo she could carry was |
packed aboard, but there were very few j
passengers. The bubonic plague scare was
Bible, as nearly all the travelers
Who had booked to sail on the steamer ;
went by other vessels. Three tugs went
to the Angel Island Quarantine Station
with the Nippon Maru, and while one of
them took the temporary crew off the
mail boa; the others brought the old â 
CTt w from the quarantine station. As j
soon as this was accomplished the j
steamer went to sea. The officers and j
men, who had been in quarantine for ,
eleven days, are not likely to forget this ;
particular voyage to San Francisco. The
cabin and steerage passengers who came
from China -and Japan on the vessel will j
be released next Wednesday. â  j
The entering and clearing of the Nippon â¢
Maru were made early, by the courtesy
of the customs authorities. As Captain ,
Allen was in quarantine, it was imjKissible
for him to gu to the Custom-house, so a 'â 
Custom-house officer was st-nt to him. In |
this way he made the usual declarations !
when the ship was entered, and after the
papers had been fumigated the}' w-re '
given to the officer on thÂ»> revenue cutter
and the Nippon Maru went to the dock.
In the same way a Custom-house officer
went to Angel Island yesterday and
cleared the ship, having the papers with
Captain Allen. When the vessel reaches
Honolulu next week her paptrs will be all
regular and she will be able to present a
clean bill of health.
Before the vessel left the Mail dock a !
number of insane Japanese were put I
abuard. They were brought from the
various asylums throughout the State,
and the practice of sending a few by each
Japanese steamer will be continued until \
all the mentally affected Japanese in Call- â 
fornia have been sent home. The Nippon \
Maru only t""k away eight cabin passen
gers. She will be a little longer at Hono*
lulu than usual, as there are over 800 tons i
of freight to put out which could not be
delivered on the upward run owing to the i
quarantine. t
The America Maru, due here on the j
Htli lnst., will be five days late She also
has been quarantine d at Nagasaki. It is
to l"- hoped that she will not repeat the
experience <>f the Nippon Maru.
ThÂ»- people who are desirous of giving;
a reception to the Oregon boys ar>- in a,
quandary. In the lirst place, they do not
know what hour of the day or night the â¢
transports will K<-t in. and in the second
place they do not know how long they
will remain when they do arrive, it was.

out to the vesesls If they arrive during
the day. but nothing has been arranged
for if they come in at night. Should |
they be sighted at any time between sun- ;
ris-- and sunset the siren on the Eureka
Planing Mills will be blown for five mm- j
utes. Then when the transports an- pass
ing in through the heads, probably half
an hour after the first signal, the siren
will be sounded again, and will continue j
Bounding until the steamers are anchored. !
The Governor and Mayor and a delega- I
ti<>n from the Native Sons will then jro
aboard and welcome the Oregon boys .<n
their safe return from the war. The i
chances seem to be against a parade of j
the regiment, The men will be just off a
long sea voyage and will be In no humor:

LAKE TAHOE AGAIN FAVORED.
The Southern Pacific Announces a
$10.80 Round Trip Rate.
Final action was taken by the South
ern Pacific yesterday on a Friday to
Monday Tahoe excursion ticket, which
as long as the season justifies will be
sold for $10.80. This breaks the record
in point of cheapness, and at once
places that popular mountain resort
prominently to the front as a place to
spr-nd Saturday and Sunday and enjoy
pleasures that are not purchasable at
any price elsewhere.
Tickets at this rate will be good nn
the train leaving this city at 6 p. m.
Fridays, and returning at 9:4u a. m. or
8:45 p. m. Mondays, which practically
rrioans from 10 a. m. Saturdays till Sun
day nights on and around the lake en
joying all the usual privileges.
It may not be untimely to suggest
that those who contemplate going do
not put it off, as there is no way of.
telling how long the season may last.

FORTY DAYS IN JAIL.
Unwarranted Confinement of Two
Soldiers on Criminal Charges.
Andrew Hogan and B. "Whitaker. regu
lars in the United States nrmy. at prf-s
--ent stationed at the Presidio, who were
nrresteri some forty days ago on charges
ot robbery, were released from custody
yesterday by Judge Lawlor on the motion
of the District Attorney. These men, it
.seemed, were haying "a good time" In a
downtown resort and a dispute arose over
t a silver watch belonging to Hogan.
Finally Hogan took it from the hands of
a man who was holding it pending a sale
of the timepiece, and the result was that
he and his friend were arrested on the
charge named. Although there was not
a particle of evidence against either one
of them, through the negligence of the
officials they remained in jail forty days
and yesterday finally managed to secure
a hearing. On hearing the testimony in
the case a motion was promptly made for
their dismissal from custody, which the
; court granted. In discharging them
I Judge I,awlor exonerated both men and
! then turned them over to the military au
i thorities. who will place them in the
guardhouse for a day for being absent
without leave, although their absence was
due to the act of some over-zealous police
men or negligent warrant clerk.

Lwhen JimÃrazell, one of the old-time Vir
ginia City mining contingent, hove in
sight. Jim was dressed in a costume con
sidered the proper thing in the mines
! some twenty or thirty years ago. He had
! a light suit of clothes on. the coat of
which was cut square around and the
i trousers of which came down in peg-top
fashion over a highly polished pair of
boots thai were fitted to the small feet
; they incased to the nicety of a fractional
part of an inch. A flowing tie held his
collar ii. place and his vest was buttoned
at the bottom button alone, allowing a
| highly ornate shirt front to burst on the
: startled vision of the casual beholder with
all the splendor of the western sun shin-
Ing Through a fog bank. To make the
! picture complete a high-crowned, soft,
1 gray felt hat tipped rakishly over one eye
rested on his head at such an angle as to
! throw a shadow half way to the end of
i the quill toothpick which he chewed in a
j nonchalant manner as he tripped along
humming the refrain of one of the late
popular songs.
Jim was a picture. The admired of all
â â  beholders. Jim knew it and was proud
;of the sensation he created. The fact that
| he had dined well. If not too wisely, did
not tend to lessen his self-esteem.
But pride goes before a fall, and just
as Jim passed the party at the telegraph
; window his foot slipped from under him
' and it -was only by the exercise of con
; siderable quickness and agility that he.
j saved himself from coming in violent and
â¢ undignified contact with the floor. As it
was, his equilibrium was considerably up
set. A titter of amusement ran through
the group at the window.
Jim turned, and, approaching the gen
tleman nearest to him, said: "Pardon me,
sir. but probably If you yourself had
fallen you could have recovered yourself
with more grace and agility than did I."
The gentleman, wishing to avoid any
i scene, assured him that the grace he dis
played was all that could be desired.
"Then, sir," continued Brazell,"you may
see something to criticize in the manner
of my locomotion?"
He was told that that was all right
also. .
"Maybe my dress docs not suit yonr es
thetic taste? Possibly you find something
to complain of in the harmony of the tune
; I was humming? Perchance the contour
of my foot does not strike your sense of
the artistic in its proportion, or it may
be the covering that incases it is what
meets with your disapproval."
He was told that his voice was like the
rippling of a mountain brook; that his
foot was a thing of beauty and a joy for
ever and that the boot which covered it
was a rare work of art.
"Is there, sir, anything In my person
ality, my dress or my behavior that you
would wish to take exception to? Can
you find aught in my being or in any of
i the articles that adorn it to provoke your
mirth?"
He was told that he was all right in
every particular.
"Then, sir"âand. doffing his hat, he
made a sweeping bow until Its crown
swept the floorâ"then, .sir, allow me to
Introduce myself to your consideration as
the only modern Cyrano dÂ© Bergerac.
Good evening."
Resuming his Interrupted tune, ha
turned on his heel and walked off, well
satisfied with the impression he had made.

WILL NOT RUN
THE DEPARTMENT
Fire Commissioners
Ask More Money.
MEET WITH SUPERVISORS
SIXTEEN COMPANIES WILL BE
DISCONTINUED.
Conference Which, Does Not Promise
Much in the Way of an In
crease for the Com
missioners.
The Supervisors have sown a good Econ-
I omy wind and they are now reaping
. whirlwinds of prayers from every depart
i mental division of the municipal govern- j
ment. The Fire Commission met yester
day morning to discuss the fiscal appro
| priation of the Board of Supervisors to
I the Fire Department and to advise with
j the Supervisors as to remedial measures.
j The appropriation under the 51 tax limit
i allows the department $9000 monthly for
current expenses; the former monthly al
i lowance to the Fire Department was $27.
--000. At present the Fire Commission is in
I dire distress. They do not know which
i way to turn, as according to their state
; ment the money allowed them will not
i pay the necessary regular expenses of the
j department.
Besides the five Commissioners, George j
! T. Bohen, who presided, Frank G. Ed- i
j wards, Colin M. Boyd, Joseph Marshall
i and R. H. Jones, seven Supervisors and
a number of men familiar with fire insur-
a nce and department affairs were present
; to advise and discuss the straits in which
j the commission finds itself. F. W. Dohr
| mann, president of the Merchants' Asso- â¢
ciation; President Havens of the Under-,
writers' Association, Charles A. Layton !
and R. Jlerold also attended the. meeting.
President George T. Bohen explained
i the condition oi affairs since the resolu
tion of the Supervisors was passed cur
; tailing the appropriation to the Fire De
j partment. In tabulated form a statement
luf comparison was read. It is as follows:
i Actual cost of department last year..?6Ss,7?S 01
j Amount appropriated this year 539,300 00
| Estimated deficit ....$110.496 01
Cost per annum of each engine -S 9,000 00
Cost per annum of each chemical 6,400 00
i Cost per annum of each truck 3,700 00
i Total TZTCO^
Placed out of service, six engines â i 54,060 00
| I 'laced out of service, seven chemicals 37, W0 00
I Placed out of service, two trucks 17,400 00
| Refrain from purchase of hose 5.383 22
Refrain from purchase of horses 4.460 OJ j
I .Refrain from purchase of hydrants â 30,861 4.:
i Total $150,044 67
â  Amount over J3.Â» C 6.
The estimated deficit that would result
if the department expenses were the same
| for the coming year as they were last
! year would amount to $146,496 01. In order
j to avoid this deficit a wholesale slashing
| would be necessary in the management.
The commlsion lias prepared a tempor
ary plan by which the deficit may be met.
This involves the discontinuance of six
teen companiesâ seven engines,, seven chem
] icals and two trucks. It mil be neces
sary also to refrain from the purchase of
hose, horses and hydrants during the com
ing year unless the Fire Department is
allowed a greater appropriation.
The companies to be displaced in case of
! necessity are: Engines â No. 33, Ocean View;

Should this lopping off of companies be
put In force 142 men would lose employ
ment. The entire chemical engine appa
ratus would be unmanned and further
purchases of hose, hydrants arid h..rs>-s
discontinued. Chief Sullivan stated the
needs of the department and put the case
plainly to the Supervisors.
"This action of the Supervisors in cur
tailing the appropriation for the Fire De
gartment is something new." said Chief
ulllvan. "The idea of forcing a cut of six
teen companies and to refrain from fur
ther purchase of necessary supplies is
fraught with danger to the city. It is
simply impossible to keep away from
great danger with this new order of
things."
The seven Supervisors present â Heycr,
Perrault, Larkmann, Byington, Collins,
Deasy and Algeltlngerâ were given an op-
F>ortunity to declare themselves and fight
ree of the entanglements which the Fire
Commissioners attempted to put upon
them in their endeavors to secure a greater
appropriation. President Havens of the
Underwriters and Rudolph Herold spoke
eloquently upon the necessity of sustain
ing the efficiency of the department.
They honed that the dollar limit would
be revoked if the Fire Department was to
suffer from efficiency.
"It Is better to have dark streets than
to have thr-m lighted by great conflagra
tirns." said Herold in answer to Perrault,
who wanted to know if a greater appro
priation were preferred to unlighted
thoroughfares.
The Supervisors, though exhorted to
lift the burden and promise the commis
sion more money, refused to take imme
diate action. They claimed that they
were pledged to the dollar limit and they
could not. as men of honor, go back upon
th<'ir former actions which were ruled by
an obedience to the wishes of the people.
One and all promised that if the Fire De
partment could possibly receive a greater
appropriation and a cut be made on other
departments this would be done. Collins
went so for as to say that he thought
the dollar limit basis of taxation would
have to be revoked In a measure to meet
the demands.
F. W. Dohrmnnn spnke at length upon
the question and stated that the Mer
chants" Association would review the
matter and do all In its power to help the
Fire Commission out of the dilemma. The
matter rests with the Supervisors, as it
stands now. The meeting was adjourned
till â \ypdnesday morning at 10 o'clock,
when final action will he taken.
HIGH-PRICED GAME.
Law Violators Are Being Heavily
Fined in the Country.
The Fish and Game Commissioners are
highly pi* ased with the work of their dep.
utlee and the county wardens in arresting
I and securing the conviction of a number
of lawbreakers recently. In Mendoclno
Cotinty marly $600 in finea has been lm
; posed for killing rWr nut of season. While
; these htintors. who are in no way Bporta-
I men, would have only a week <>r two to
wait for the open season on deer to come
i in they have tnken the chances of arrest,
: arid in most cr-scs paid dearly for their
: game killing. The last punishment report
ied at the Commissioners' office was the
I fining of two hunters $50 each at I'kiah.
Game Warden Ornbaum arrested John
Harms of Layunville and Henry Mohlen
brock of San Francisco, and found thirty
deerhides in a box belonging to the man
from this city. The Commissioners say
j that it is no wonder that deer are report
ed as scarce on the opening of each sea
son wh^n such miscreants as these go
into the hills and commit such slaughter
at times when the law is supposed to
protect the game. This year, however,
there are more sportsmen's associations
for the protection of game than ever be
' fore and their co-operation with the com
] mission is accomplishing much in the en-
I forcement of the laws.
Turned Over to His Father.
Charles H. Johnson, who was accused
of grand larceny for stealing a watch and
$20 from the purser of the steamer H. J.
Corcoran, appeared before Judge
Treadwell yesterday. Johnson had been
taken before the Insanity Commissioners
on complaint of his father, who lives in
Stockton, but he was remanded back to
the City Prison The purser refused yes
terday to prosecute the case, and as *.hr>
young man's father, who was in court,
told the Judge that his son hr.d been ten
years In a private asylum and was not
responsible for hi? actions, the Judge dis
missed the case and turned him over to
his father.

BEST GAME OF THE WEEK
ABOUNDS IN PRETTY WORK
WITH THE IRONS.
The New "King of the Links" For
merly a Football Player of Re
nown on the Princeton
College Team.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ONWEXTSIA CLUB GOLF COURSE,
LAKE FOREST. hi July S. -Herbert M.
Harriman of the Meadowbrook Golf Club
of Hempstead. 12 1., ' -day won the ama
teur po'.f championship of America from
Fir.dlay D. Douglas, who won the ehnm
pior.ship last year. The score was three
up. two to play. The game was by long
odds the most exciting that has been
played in the week's tournament, and
when the old Princeton football player
finally holed down on the thirty-fourth,
bringing the coveted championship to
himself, the crowd broke into enthusiastic
cheering and Harriman was nearly lifted
off his feet by. the crush to congratulate
him.
For the first time amateur golf cham
pionship tournaments have been held in
America an American-born golfer holds
the honors, and this fact was most com
mented on by golfers to-night, who believe
it will go far toward popularizing th
game in the United States. Harriman's
work with the irons during the morning
game was pronounced the prettiest teen
during the tournament, although the
jnedal score (*1 > was one more than that
made by Douglas earlier in the week. But
hi? playing was a marvel of steadiness
and although Douglas almost invariably
I outdrove him the difference was not enough
to materially affect the result, and the
Meadowbrook man's appro; and work
on the greens forced Douglas to play the
odd in nearly every instance. Old golfers
âmen who learned the game* on the links
in Scotlandâ pronounced Harriman's p!ay
Euperior to nny ever shown in a tourna
ment in the United States and fully equal
to amateur playing in Scotland. Douglas
on the contrary, especially during the
morning, was sadly out of form in his
putting, and although during th*- after
noon he made a remarkably game uphill
fight, the handicap of tight down, the
result of the morn play, was too
great for him to overcome.
Conditions were far from favorable for
first-class 1 golf during the morning, the
high wind which swept over the links
rendering good driving extremely difficult
-on the first, second, third, tenth, eleventh,
twelfth, thirteenth and fourteenth holes.
But this apparently did not affect _ tne
; playing of either man. and their drives
were nearly all long and splendidly
placed. Douglas 1 poor short iron work
was fatal. Time and again during the
morning he lost holes or missed oppor
tunities to halve by missing puts of from
one to two yards. During the afternoon
the young Scotchman, with the score
nine-' in favor of Harriman, played
desperately. Playing bogey or better and
taking advantage of any misplay by his
opponent Douelas slowly but surely re
duced the lead.
But at last an error of judgment settled
the question. On the -fourth, the
"baby" hole, where Dougias had fallen in
the morning, h,e used his brassie and
drove far beyond into the trees. Harri
man smiled grimly as he saw the little
guttapercha ball alight in the grove, and.
taking his mid-iron, he lofted his ball to
a beautiful lie squarely on the green.
"With ..... disappeared Douglas' last
chance, for. a moment later. Harriman
holed his ball and the championship was
lost and won.
Mr. Douglas found some consolation in
his defeat fur the championship by win
ning the three-handed tie for the bronze
medal in the qualifying round on Monday.
Douglas' score was forty-two for the nine
holes played. W. J. Travis making it in
forty-four. D. R. Fcrgan gave up at the
eighth hole.
The annual golf tournament ball was
held in the Onwt-ntsia Clubhouse to-day,
marking the formal closing of the tourna
ment of I>&9.
At 2:2." p. m. Harriman teed off for the after- .

Douglas outdrove Harriman five yards for the

The latter played safe to one side, but Harri
man. by a beautiful four-yard put, halved the
hole' in" five. ~ : y-
For the twenty-ninth Douglas a* usual out
drove Harriman. Their maahie approaches laid
them i.-a.l on thÂ« green, but Harriman was

a two-yard put. and EÂ»ouglass went down in

Approaching the thirtieth hole, both were, on

It was almost. a clean run of eight miles
to Needles. Very soon the foresail and
flying jib were broken out with a jib
headed topsail, hoisted beneath ?v bloody
hand on white ground, the pennant of the
Royal Ulster Yacht Club. That was all
the sail she carried during: the spin,
which lasted for seven hours and twenty
five minutes. On the run down the Sham
rock appeared sluggish. Her mainsail
puckered badly in the after leach, but top-

sail, flying jib and foresail were perfect.
Her mainsail; remarkably peaked, attract
ed attention. Â«' ; V
Outside the Needles there was a good
sailing breeze) The Shamrock came about
on the starboard tack, close hauled for
the each to westward. Then, as though
now life had been infused in her. she
started off. leaving everything with pails
standing", only the quickest steamers man
aging to keep level with her.
The wind was now northwest. The
Shamrock, it became evident, was a stiff
boat, standing up like a church In the
strong breeze, and while she was sloshing
up under her bobstay she left the water
very clean. From these facts yachtsmen
can "draw their own conclusions.
Nearing with the boom to starboard.
which, notwithstanding its size, caused
no perceptible list of the boat, and reach
ing back to Calshot, she met a stiff gale,
going straight into the wind toward home
on this last Tacking.
When the Shamrock returned the wind
had effectively blown out all the defects
of the mainsail previously mentioned. It
looked as nice a stretch of canvas as one
would wish to see. setting remarkably
well for the first day. During the spin
the Shamrock was smartly handled, the
spinnaker and Jackyard topsail not being
used. .
At Cowes and Ryde much excitement
was aroused when it was known the

Special Cab!Â» to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1599, by James Gor
don Bennett.
SOUTHAMPTON, Eng., July B.â The
Shamrock, with her light green glis
tening sides, lies off Hythe, which is
almost opposite here, in the bay. just
at the mouth of the Achen. Her pe
culiar color makes her very conspicu
ous. She is the object of constant at
tention. She- lies almost in the direct
route of incoming and outgoing steam
ers. The passengers of the last out
going American steamer lined up and
gave the Shamrock three rousing
cheers, which the crew of the racer re
plied to with re-echoing heartiness.
Yachts in number from Ryde, Cowes,
South Sea and Southampton hover
about the green racer. Opera glasses
and telescopes are raised, with eyes full
of curiosity behind them. The usual
remark after scrutinizing her is:
"What a boom th-' Shamrock has."
On board all is movement. She has
two captains â Wringe and Hogarth.
She needs both. They have their work
cut out. Remember that she has ji n
enormous canvas area of 14,000 square
feet, with its Â» ndlesa tackle and ac
companiments to be looked after and
dealt with. All that canvas is the most
finished work of the creat-st sail mak
ers of the world â Lapthorne & Ratsey.
They are far from being ordinary sails,
but ar^ made of the finest selected sea
Island cotton. They are very, very
dear, but exnense has not been con
sidered in this particular point any
mure than in any .-thtT Whatever
money can get has been got. Never
has a yacht so equipped !Â» s ft England.
Fife, her o>s;ign"r. has put his entire
mind, all his well-known genius, and
th^ full results of his long experience
into tlv- Shamrock. !!>â¢ Jealously over
set a every detail of fitting up.
File- the most silent of menâ will not
speak; having been h^r creator, he now
is silent, vigilant guardian of his prreat
work â its sentinel. Even Sir Thomas
Ldpton's closest friends are not allowed
aboard. But nevertheless were he to
speak, Fife would say:
"We have Â£"t a flyer; we have a
yacht much better than anything be
fore known here. If the Americans
beat us they will have to work hard
for it. Don't let you American yachts
men think that you are going to have
a run-away triumph."
There are at least two persons here
who are much interested and who be
lieve that the Shamrock stands more
than a good chance of bringing home
the cup. That best and most skilful
English yachtsman, known as "Willie"
Jameson, who, like Fife, is a man of
few words, has spoken highly of her.
He is a yachtsman who has so many
times steered the Britannia to victory
and who used to be invincible with the
Iverna.
I^ocal people, who all know a hit
about yachting, are very much taken
with the Shamrock. She is a racer's
craft, they say. She reminds them of
the lines of the Navahoe, but then, of
course, the spars are ever su much
larger. The mainmast is vast, and the
topmast is in proportion. Her llyin?
jihhoom seems to stretch out over forty
feet.
But what strikes one most about the
Shamrock <>n close examination is that
there is scarcely a bit of wood about
her at all. Her entire hull is of metal â
thin metal. What we see below thÂ»
light green paint of the boat-topping
is glistening bronze. The deck is
covered with canvas, but from the
noise it makes when men walk over it
it must evidently be of metal. The
water splashes up against the beautiful
overhang of stem and re-echoes a me
tallic response. But the noise shows
that the shell is thin. Her boom and
gaff, as already known, are hollow
steel. The big mainmast is of steel.
The long spinnaker boom, which is
stowed, as it reaches within a foot of
the topmast, is of steel. The topmast
is of wood and the crosstrees of Ameri
can ash. The jibboom is a beautiful
bit of wood. All the rigging is of wire,
and appears exceedingly light, with
much of tackle of corrugated steel. The
report that the Shamrock has a center
board is pure nonsense.
COLUMBIA
BEATS THE
DEFENDER
Satisfactory Test of the
Speed of the Two
Yachts.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ» Call.
] NEW YORK. July B.â At last the bis
I sloop yachts Columbia and Defender have
I met in a battle-royal that has been satis
-1 factory to all concerned. In a strong and
fairly" steady breeze and smooth water
they sailed over a course of about twenty
six miles to-day, and in covering that
' distance the Columbia fairly and squarely
outsailed the Defender by S^inutes 13
seconds actual time.
If the Columbia, after measurement, is
: found to allow the Defender two minute?
! she will still have beaten her by 1 minute
il3 seconds. That means that she can beat
i her now over a full thirty-mile course by
J at least two minutes, corrected time, and
\ that when she is tuned up. say by the
â  September races, she will easily beat her
[ five minutes, which is all that is required
of her. Â
1 To-day's race was as fine a smooth-
w.-it<>r tf-st as the yachts may ever expect
t< get. Here are the official figures show
ing the times of each yacht:
Boatâ Start. Finish. Time.
Columbia 12:40:53 3:2Â»:03 2:43:16
Defender ... 12:40:41 3:27:10 2:46:2)
On the first leg of the course, a reach
of about four miles, with a beam wind,
the Defender gained two seconds. On the
second leg of six miles, in which there
was some windward work. the Columbia
gained 1 minute 53 seconds. On the third
leg. a three-mile run before the wind, with
spinnakers set. the Defender gained six
seconds. On the first leg the secord time
around the Columbia gained 1 minute, 11
seconds: in the close-hauled work on the
second leg she gained only 36 seconds, and
in the run to the finish the Defender
gained 43 seconds.
The only unfortunate part of to-day's
event was the fact that both of the yachts
sailed the wrong course. It was. In fact,
the feature of the day. and the strange?
action of those in charge of the yachts
kept every one guessing as to the ultimate
result.
The fir-* !<-g of the course n-as to have
been tight milfs long, the turning point
being off Stamford, Conn. Th*> yachtsmen
of the Riverside Club were having a rate
â¢ sound. They set their turning
point un the course the Columbia a-H De
fender wore to sail over, but only four
miles from their starting- point. Whi n,
after an exciting luffing match. Captain
Rhodes saw this mark, he promptly kept
the Defender off and rounded it, and for
a while no one knew whether it was a
r> j al race or not.
C. Oliver Iselin explained matters when
seen aft*>r the race. He said:
"The Defender made the mistake and
we simply followed her to make a race.
It has turned out a good one. We are
very well satisfied with it all around. We
both made a mistake, but it has been the
best all-around race we have yet had. I
am satisfied that the Columbia is the bet
tor boat, but she will go to Bristol and
have her sails recut before she races
again."
The regatta committee says that the
event will be considered as a race and
Commodore Postley probably will award
the cup to- the Columbia.
LARCHMONT. X. V.. July S.â The Co
lumbia, in running in' for her moorings
after to-day's race, fouled the Defender 3
boom .with her port topmast shroud and
afterward by the topmast backstay,
bending the Defender's hollow steel spar
almost at right angles. The Columbia
was uninjured and immediately afterward
caught her own moorings. The Defender
will go to Bristol on Monday, where the
damaged boom will be straightened and
if ntcessary spliced.

resentative of "Kid" McCoy, says the
announcement sent out from Chicago
last nig-ht that McCoy had been match

FIRE AT THEVOLTA
ELECTRICAL EXHIBITION
Defective Wires Cause a Destruction
of the Buildings and Many
Valuable Belies.
COMO. Italy. July B.â The Volta Electri
cal Exhibition was entirely destroyed by
fire to-day, due to defective electric
wires. Many relics of Volta perished.
There was no loss of life. The firemen
succeeded in saving a number of the prin
cipal effects of Volta.
The fire broke out in the marine gallery
and spread with marvelous rapidity owing
to the combustible nature of the build
ings and their contents. Many visitors
fled in a state of panic. Two gas meters?
exploded with a report that was heard a
distance of several miles, and the im
mense column of smoke which arose, was
visible in Milan, twenty-eight miles away.
The insurance on the property destroyed
is light, being only 1.000.000 lyre, exclusive
of what was carried by individual ex
hibitors.

Have Been Added to the Staff
of California's Most Popular
and Efficient Medical Insti-

DR. MEYERS & CO.
Ever in the Lead With Cures. Ever
in Favor With Suffering Men,
This Association of Specialists
Have Recently Brought Skill ard
Experience from the Old World
Which Is of the Utmost Import-
ance to Men Who Are Suffering
With a Weakness op a Disease.
CONSULTATION AND ADVfCE FREE
Not being content with thÂ« largest
and best equipped medical insti-
and the most extensive practice in
America, a large and experienced staff
of doctors and surgeons, the ma: ?
of Dr. Meyers Â£ Co. haw secured the
services of two of the most emin^-i.t
specialists in EuropÂ«, Dr. Holsman and
Dr. Palmer.
The?^ two specialist?, mature inyears,
and experienced in all branches of their
profession, have been making marvel-
ous In England. France an i
many for over twenty years. They are
both graduates from the best schools
of medicine and surgery have be-
come proficient in treating chroni dis-
eases in general.
A BOON TO SUFFERERS.
They have brought with them the
latest and most important discoveries
in the lines of remedii s, methods and
curative appliances the world has
known. A large number of Americans
have gone to Europe to see these spe-
cialists at a cost of hundreds of dollars
and were cured by them.
People can now consult Doctors Hod-
man and Palmer without an expensive
trip across the ocean, by calling at
â ol Market street, this city. The price
of cures has not been advanced by Dr.
Meyers & Co. on account of this addi-
tion to their staff. although this innova-
tion will necessitate an additional ex-
penditure of many thousands of doilarg
annually. No pay till cured.
THE OLD FAVORITES.
In the meantime all the doctors who
have so long been with Dr. Meyers &
Co., and who have cured and restored
so many men on the Pacific Coast, are
still at their post, as willing as ever and
still more capable of healing the sick,
giving strength to the weak and hope
to the despondent.
Ailing men always find it a pleasure
to call on Dr. Meyers & Co. They are
given the most courteous attention and
learn much of value about their physi-
cal condition, even if they do not de-
cide to take treatment.
THREE WAYS OF BEING CURED.
Sufferers may call at the San Fran-
cisco office, consult a part of the staff
when they make th<Mr regular monthly
visits to interior towns, or take the
home-cure treatment. While it is pref-
erable to see patients in many in-
stances, it is not always necessary.
Dr. Meyers & Co. have been using a
successful system for curing out-of-
town patients for many years. Thou-
sands of men throughout the West
have been made strong and healthy in
this manner.
If it is not convenient for you to
see th^ doctors write them a letter.
They will send you free of charge ques-
tion list and give you much valuable
advice. After you learn the exact na-
ture of your ailment and find out the
cost of treatment, you can be cured or
not, just as you pleast*.
DELAY MAY MEAN DEATH.
If you have a symptom don't imagine
that it does not mean anything. Symp-
toms always mean something', as thou-
sands have learned to tht-ir sorrow. If
you have an ailment do not labor under
the delusion that it. will "Get well it-
self." Such things, unfortunately for
mankind, never occur. A sufferer may
feel better at times, but in such in-
stances the deadly enemy is only lurk-
ing in the shadows of a dansr- â 
stimulant or temporary relaxation of
pain to spring upon his unsuspecting
victim like a veritable demon of de-
struction.
A few dollars should not stand in the
way of health, life and happiness. Na-
ture decreed that you should be sound
and healthy. If you are not in that
condition at the present moment, you
are doing an injustice to yourself,
friends and family by not hems cured.
AILMENTS THEY CURE.

John Parnell Whit<_wings Cahill was
also visible to the â  eye dur
ing the afterno'in. Rumor has it that
J. P. \V. has invested in new raiment and
there must be some ' foundation for the
rumor, for he lias suddenly grown proud
and haughty; manifesting a strong deter
mination to break away from the estab
lished rules of baseball and inaugurate
rules of hi* own. It wasn't right, though,
for the crowd to call Patsy's decisions
rotten; that expression is entirely inade
quate. Patsy had to fumigate him
self at frequent intervals as a pro
tection against his own awful judg
ment. While they had no direct bearing
on the general result still they tore th.
hearts out of the visitors, who early
abandoned all hope.
Cahill started in to spread himself dur
ing Watson^ first turn at bat, the
locals in their half having piled up five
runs, four of which were the result of a
missed third strike by Morrow, two
doubles, three singles and a sacrifice doing
the trick. Brockhoff singled and moved
to second on a base on balls to Court
ney. He was playing off the bag when
Fitz suddenly threw the ball to catch him
napping. The ball struck Bmckhoff over
the kidney, knocking him down and out.
He felt across the bag. but rolled over
and off of it. Harper shouted to Cahill
to call game temporarily, but Patsy re
fused to do so and O'Neil ran into the
field, got the ball and tagged the prostrate
and barely conscious man. Cahill prompt
ly called him out and would listen to no
arguments.
After that the game lost all interest,
but Patsy remained at the old stand. In
the second inning Pyne was on second
and Whelan threw to catch him napping.
The ball hit Cahill, who gave the doctor
another base for it. though on what
grounds nobody knows.
Then in the third Pyne sent a high fly
out to Croll. who caught the ball, jug
gled it an instant, but managed to hold
it Cahill. however, declared ( "roll dropped
the" ball, although he was the only per
son in the lot who thought so.
Later in the game Whelan, just to show
.Cahill that he bore no ill will, carried a
schooner of sharp steam out to the um
pire. As Patsy could not accept the com
pliment during the game he fined Whelan
$;> for tantalizing him.
Four hits, no two of which came in the
same Inning, were the sum total of the
stick work off Fitzpatrick. He was ably
supported at all . nts but short, Krug
again having an off day. The score:

AFFRIES AND
COCK- EYE HOGAN
IN A MIX-UP
JIM JEFFRIES is supposed to be
the only man of his kind in the
world. Quite without an equal.
He may be without an equal, but
â¢ after that which occurred at the
Orpheum last night he will never be able
to deny that he has at least one counter
part, as far as countenance and general
physical resemblance go.
George Hayes, who plays "Cockeye Ho
gan" in "The Wise Guy" at the Orpheum,
bears a striking 1 likeness to the unde
feated defeater of the heretofore unde
feated champion of champions. It is so
marked that many who know Jeffries well
have been so deceived that they have
been forced to look twice to assure them
selves that it was not the giant boiler
maker at whom they were gazing.
Jeffries himself has heard so much of
this that last night he made a visit to
the Orpheum for the express purpose of
taking a squint at his double. Meyers
took him in behind the scenes and intro
duced the two men. Shortly after it came
the turn of Hayes to go on and before ac
changed his costume for his act he ad
vanced to the front of the curtain and
bowed to the audience.
The people in the house took one look
and then went wild. They imagined they
were applauding the man who gave Fitz
simmons his "Waterloo. -_.-ââ
As soon as the noise subsided Hayes
made a witty speech and then, introduc
ing Ross O'Neill, Brady's representative,
he gave way to that gentleman, in order
to allow him to present the real article
Jeffries merely bowed and then retired
without saying a word. "When the show
was over every one knew that a Joke had
been played, but there were many who
are still guessing which was the real
thing. â 
TO WORK CLEOPATRA'S MINES.
A London Jeweler's Concession From
the Egyptian Government.
"Yes. we've got a concession from the
Egyptian Government which give? us the
right to mine for emeralds and other pre
cious stones on the coast Of the Red Sea
the next five years." said a well
known Bond street jeweler.
"I have not yet signed the concession,
but It's all right. Egyptian emeralds?
Here's a basketful, or at least of or.- or
talcose schist, from which the env-raliis
â i r- derived. Here's a fine piece of timer
aid now, and here and here."
To the uninitiated eye they were not ex
actly flashing green tires, and the reporter
ted to know if the color was coming
by a later mall.
"Color? Some of these have been lying

Many Hares Prove

SOME WARM FAVORITES LOSE
HUMMER PUTS OUT THE IM
PORTED METALLIC.
The Dogs Nearly Run Themselves to
a Standstill in One of the
Longest Courses of
the Year.
The sport was fast and furious at T'nion
Coursing Park yesterday. The hares were
unusually fast, a number making their
way to the escapes, while others led the
fastest dogs all over the field. The long
est coarse of the day was between Pasha
Kennel's [mported Metallic and E. M.
Kellogg's Hummer. The latter found few
supporters in the betting, although th<>
tempting odds of 5 to i were Laid against
him. The dogs ran for three minutes
and killed as a fresh dog was about to
be released;
To the surprise of the spectators, Hum
mer had nui'h the better of th.- firsi part
of the course. H<=- let Metallic in for a
time and then took the lead in the run
ning. He won ultimately, but was so
thoroughly worked out as to preclude any
probability of his making so good a show
ing to-day.
October Woodcock won his course with
Gold Hill, although he disappointed his
supporters at first. Gold Hill had all the
best of it for a time, but his brindle op
ponent secured the hare and by clever
working ran up a safe score before the
end, when Gold Hill won.
Crawford Braes beat Theron, which had
the best of the run up. once Crawford
Braes secured possession of the hare he
had Theron beaten.

The course between Benicia Boy and

MANEATERS.
Tricks of the Savage Lions in Their
Native Jungles.
"When lions become maneaters these in
ert and treacherous brutes take no 1111
--n." essary trouble to catch men, and
while human being-? are plentiful none of
them undertake perilous enterprises or
proceed on any haphazard expeditions.
They know what to do and where to go
that prey may be procured with the least
amount of risk or exertion. Such a lion is
well aware of who tills this cornfield or
that mealle patch. He has informed him
self of how many men accompany the
village herds, where am- outlying camps
are situated and how they are guarded.
There Is no route by which travelers pro
ceed or traffic Is carrie on that such ani
mals have not studied with reference to
the fac.it its for attack they afford and
their "wn bodily powers. If otherwise
rood strategic positions present natural
dllTU'ulties the lion not only considers how
these can be overcome, but perhaps prac
tices his part beforehand. At all events
he has been watched while engaged in ex
erclses that can only be explained in this
way.
"So puny a creature as man Is, when un
proviued with effective hnplements for
offense stands little chain, . against such
a foe â an assailant having forty times his
strength, backed by marvelous activity
and an Intense passion lor carnage, I'ii
der these circumstances savages can only
shut themselves up or assault their *ne"
my in large masses. On the other hand.
precautions taken by a murderous
lion might not seem to comport with that
bold and often reckless temper attributed
to this species. But such a discrepancy
has no real existence; it only appears
when a -judgment Is made without taking
all the facts into consideration. This ani
mal's Intelligence, developed In maneaters
to its highest point, together with an or
ganic stealthinesF of nature and pro
clivity toward unexpected attacks and
stratagems, fully accounts for everything
a lion does in the way of guarding against
failure-"â Outing.
Bats Overcome by Heat.
Rats on ice presented a novel
spectacle on Wednesday last to some of
xho residents on South Tenth street.
One of these, while carrying In an ex
tra supply of ice to her refrigerator,
was surprised to see a I arse gray
rodent squatting on all fours on top of
a block of ice which had been chopped
in the yard receptacle; nor would he
move at the word of command, simply
winking at her until dislodged by
means of a clothes prop. Even when
chased out of the back gate the rat did
not run away, but, with his gaze on the
iceman, followed him to the next stop
ping place, where he again ensconced
himself on top of an ice block. It is
sunnosed that the extreme heat drove
the rodents to seek this relief.âPhila

CHAMPIONSHIP
FIGHT PROVOKES
LOCAL INTEREST
Sporting Host Anxious
to Have It Here.
MANY REASONS GIVEN FOR IT
JEFFRIES WILL FIRST MEET
MITCHELL.
New York Clubs Will Soon Bid for
the Match Between the Cham
pion and Thomas
Sharkey.
Charles Newman and the CJlr-n Park
management are responsible for the tidal
wave of enthusiasm that Is sweeping over
this city. On every street corner c< I
of men are indulging in fight talk, weigh
ing Shark-y and Champion Jeffries in
their own mental scales and ending ;bÂ»ir
Tsation with ;i hop,, that Sun Fran
cisco will be the theater of the next
heavy-weight championship battle.
Two offers of $40,060 each are now before
the public one fr>>m Charles Newman,
who will pay that big sum of money for
the fight; the other from the Glen Park
Company., who will guarantee the same
amount. Newman has deposited a $5000
check with The Call as an assurai
good faith: the (Jlen Park Company has
done the same and doubled the amount.
The ball has thus been given the lirst
rolling i-tart. Id all probability it will
cross the continent, for the Eastern clubs
have begun offering fabulous sums for
this great fistic event. There Is no
reason why it should not return to this
city and bring: with it the heavy-weight
championship light, of the day. Our local
promoters are in earnest and they will
remain tirm to their offer; an acceptance
will bind the contract.
William A. Brady, who is doing Jeffries'
thinking just a: present, is in England,
and O'Rourke, Sharkey's mentor, is in
N( w York. With thÂ»-se men rests the linal
selection of the club before wliich the
principals will stand and deliver. It is
known that both fighters are willing to
cross mits in this city, and there is no
antipathy to a local ring on the part of
thtir managers. The sporting element or'
this city Is on the alert and all Ou-ir in
fluence will be ex. rted to have the mill
take place here.
There is no other city in the country
which offers better accommodations to
the men who come mil>s to see a gr< :
prize-fight. Our restaurants and I
are known all over the country and p â .-
sess a reputation with the best sporting
nifii foi excellence in quality at a mini
mum charge. The hotel men and the rt-s
--taurateurs are even willing to make spe
menta if the tigr.t will conn- to
San Francisco.* Not a single militating
condition exists. All that remains is a
courtesy oi two from the railroad. This
nu doubt will be shown in the way of
special, reduced rates for transportation.
In the Eastern States there art many
competing lines, ra<-h willing to reduce
rates to meet the popular cry. This city
Itself Is alive with the pugilistic bacilli
and more people would turn out to Bei
big prize fight than in any other city
twice its size. A walk up and unwn the
"line" is all that is necessary to convince
the least ardent fight promoter of this
fact. Even at this early day. when the
first bids iire hardly cooled, the public
of this city is lost in right conjectures.
Whether or not the tight will tak.- place
in San Francisco time alone will tell.
Th^ following telegraphic news was re
ceived last night from The Call's New
York correspondent :
"The Herald says: 'Local club man
agers are not in the Wast disturb' '1 over
two offers from San Francisco of
each for the world's heavy-weigni
championship battle between James J.
Jeffries av.<\ Thomas Sharkey. They have
so far refrained from bidding for the
event. Lan both th<- Coney Island Sport
ing Club and the Lenox Athletic Club will
be heard from in due time.
" 'Al"\ Brown, manager of the Coney
Island Sporting Club, said to-day th.it his
organization would certainly offer a purse
for the contest. "We have," said Mr.
Brown, "not yet decided upon the size
of the purse, but our offer will be as
large, if not larger, than that of any rival
organization. We have demonstrated our
ability to handle big events successfully,
and as we have an ideal clubhouse I think
we can afford to outbid all competitors."
" -The Lenox Athletic Club officials also
said that they will make a big offer for
the battle and will leave no stone un
turned to have the bout take place at
their clubhouse. At the office of William
A. Brady, Jeffries' manager. I was in
formed that although the champion per
sonally favors California as the battle
ground, he will appear before the club
offering the most money. Mark Thall. the
San Francisco theatrical man and a
friend of the officials of the Glen Park
Association, who arrived In this city to
day, told me that Californlans are' de
termined to secure th^ big fight, and that
if pressed by other clubs they will otter
a purse of $60,000 for the- event. Accord
ing to a letter received in this city yes
terday from William A. Brady, who is
now in England. Brady has made ar
rangements for a ten-round bout between
Jim Jeffries and Charley Mitchell, to take
place in the Olympia building in London
on SeplÂ«mber 1.
" "Jeffries will try hard to knock out
the former English champion inside the
limit. Brady states that Mitchell has gone
into training at Brighton. England, for
the contest. Jeffries will soil for Kngland
on July 27. so that ho will have three
weeks in which to train.' "

A BASHFUL KING.
Trials of an Artist in Attempting to
Paint a Royal Portrait.
M. de la Neziere, who is just back from
' thp west coast of Africa, has been spend
ing some months in laborious attempts to
paint the portrait of Samory. the van
â  quished King, under considerable difficul
ties. The dethroned potentate has the
greatest objection to artists in general.
| and in particular deemed it a piece of
' gross impertinence on the part of M. de la
Neziere to want to catch his likeness. His
I dusky majesty had to be coaxed with in
numerable gifts of cigarettes, matches
i and coppers Into giving the painter a sit
! tingr. Among: all thÂ»- presents showered
: upon him. small change, which he used
promptly to put in his mouth as a precau
tion against pickpockets, was what he
liked best.
At last Bamory was mollified, began to
call M. d< la Nealere by the only French
word he knew, "camarade," and gra
ciously consented to sit.
The unfortunate artist's difficulties were
: not yet, however, at an end. When Sa
mory saw his royal features being drawn
upon canvas, he was suddenly taken
i with a bashful fit that lasted on and off
for several weeks. He used every now
I and then to hide his countenance beneath
his turban and resolutely refuse to un
veil. Whenever it happened that Sa
; mory's feelings of modesty were thus un
accountably hurt, the sitting had In
variably to be given up for the day. At
other times the fallen, but still capricious.
monarch used seriously to disturb the
I painter's work by sprinkling him and his
i canvas with water. At last, however. M.
j de la Neaeire succeeded in getting a few
! sketches of Samory. which 'he has
brought back with him. and from which
he intends painting a finished portrait of
j the dethroned King.â Paris correspond

SAILOR'S SIGNAL.
That Showed Him How to Steer for ;
Mate's Shore Ship.
While the J'nited States steamer
â¢ Brooklyn Is beinp; repaired shore leave
is given in turn to batches "f Bailors.
One man. who lives fn this city, on the
! East Side and who was allowed to re
main With his family for two or throe
days, invited a shipmate to take dinner
i with him last Sunday. I'nfortunatelv the
i shipmate lost the address and could re
member only the name of the street.
> Reaching 1 the street he walked up and
down, asking every other person he met
if be knew the house whore a sailor be
longing to the Brooklyn lived. None
, knew. The man. nonplused, was ab Â»ut
to give op iii> search, when he observed
a youth sitting on a doorstep amusing
himself with an old battered bugle. A
thought struck the sailor.
"I. end me that a minute." he said to
the young man as he grasped the horn.
â  Putting it to his ltps he sounded with all
â  his might the dinner call of the Brooklyn.
S:ir>' enough, two or three seconds later.
from a window n.>t fifty yards away, a
li. ad was thrust and a strong, lusty voice
called out: "Ship ahoy: Full speed ahead
up bere. Mesa has been waiting half<an
! hour for you."â New York Tribune.

VISIT THE PARK
AND UNIVERSITY
OF CALIFORNIA
Agriculturists Begin
Their Inspection.
STATE TO BE BENEFITED
J. E. STUBBS EXPLAINS HOW IT
WILL COME ABOUT.
Â»
The Association Will Be the Means of
Directing Many Young Men
Who Will Make Their
Homes Here.
The delegates of the American Associa
tion of Agricultural Colleges and Experi
ment Stations practically began their of
ficial inspection of California yesterday.
In the morning they visited the Cliff
House, after whJ< h they went to the park. ;
Their especial inter* st was eeutered in the
conservatory. Here the section on agrl- â 
culture and botany spent several hours ;
making a-thorouhg investigation of every
thing that was shown them. The dele- 'â¢
gates were loud in their pral.se of the
wonderful floral and horticultural beauty
of tin- park. Many of them had in-ver
anything like it. and when they were
informed that the park had been made
-inn. n ground that was once formerly a
mass of sand bills they were almost in
credulous in their expressions.
In tho afternoon the delegates went to
Berkeley, where they were shown the l"ni- ;
versitj "f California, the various build- I
ln^s and different departments. Every
facilltj whs extended the delegates for,
seeing the work that is being done by the
University. C. B. Williams, chemisi of
North Carolina, said tliat the chemical
department and laboratory was mir of the !
besi equipped In the United States, ile is;
it graduate ol Johns Hopkins University,
which is held t<> have na,- of th>- besi
chemical departments of any college In
this country. H< said that he had also
inspected 1 1 1 Â» â  department at Harvard, but
thai the one at the University of Califor
nia was finer than either of those that hÂ«
mentioned. The major portion of the
afternoon was spent by the delegates at |
the University. They greatly admired .the
grounds and the tree 9, while the garden,
where are raised the many varieties of
Tart- floral plants, excited their chief In- I
t< rest.
J. E. Stubbs, who was recently elected
presid.-nt of the association, in speaking :
of the manner in which California will
i eneflted by the Inspection that will |
be made by the delegates, said:
"There are two very decided ways in
â which tiiis State will reap a benefit. First
let me say that every nun who has visited
. as a member of this association
be talking and writing about the
E c i ontinually for the next six months.
This will mean extensive advertising for
California in every State In t'ne Union.
Nx; when you consider the Influence of
ti:.- members of the association it Is easj
to see where the benefit will come In. All
. in â¢!!.â  either presidents of agricul
â¢ â  directors of experi
ment stations. As such ih>--. wield a wide
Influence, for they are in rios,- touch with
rths of the people of this coun
try. They are frequently appeal c- to for
Information regarding the Interests uf tlie
different States and the besi place for
people to settle. As the heads of colleges
they will direct here many young men
who will make California th.'ir home. The
Influx of young men who come here to
en^a*;" In agricultural pursuits will mean
the gradual breaking up of your large
ranches, which, I think, will ,ienertt the
for where iue farms are smaller
the demand for transportation makes bet
ter railway facilities, and this in Itself
means theopening and upbuilding of any
As a result of the trip of lhe as
sociation to this Star.' many yomiK men.
who are now in agricultural colleges, will
be persuaded to come dir'-ct to California
â to settle.
"The delegates will be able to benefit
California in the matter of appropriations.
They will see the many ways in which the
ice of agriculture and botany and
horticulture can be advanced by this
State having larger appropriations, and
with this association behind It any de
mand that the State may raaÂ»e Congress
will not be long In granting."
The delegates leave at 7:JO o'clock to
morrow morning for I'kiah '<n a special
train tendered them t>y President Paster
of the California Northwestern Kallroad.
Reduced His Force.
Superintendent Hewitt of the Fire
Alarm and Police Telegraph reduced his
force yesterday to comply -with the appro
priation for his office in accordance with
the new tax levy recently passed by the
Board of Supervisors. Mr. .Hewitt will
r.ow try to get along with three ooera
tors, three assistant operators :md one re
pairer. Under the old order of things he
had six operators, six assistants and
eleven repairers.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 9, 1899.
SAME OLD STORY,
"DID NOT KNOW
IT WAS LOADED"
Private Drake Shot by
Private Gassway.
RESULT OF A FOOLISH JOKE
ONE SOLDIER IS DEAD. THE
OTHER CRAZED WITH GRIEF.
Lieutenant Colonel Henry Wagner
Has Left for His Home in New
Yorkâ Colonel W. F.
Randolph Arrives.
The same old story of "didn't know it
was loaded" has had another fatality
added to its already long list of victims.
Private H. R. Drake. Troop F, Sixth
Cavalry, in consequence of the careless
j rn-ss of his friend and fellow soldier, Pri
vate Gassway of the same troop, is in the
1 dead mom of the general hospital at the
: Presidio awaiting burial at the hands of
his comrades.
The tragedy occurred shortly before 10
o'clock in the quarters of the men, and as
is the ruU- in such cases death followed
! closely upon the heels of carelessness and
j a foolish joke. Gassway hod just returned
from guard duty. He had with him his
; pistol, which he supposed was emptied of
all of its cartridges. The men got to jok
ing about a piece of tobacco which Drake
had, and Gassway laughingly told him
that hf would shoot him for it. and tak
ing his pistol out of his pocket he pointed
â it at Drake and pulled the trigger. The
: weapon proved to be loaded. The bullet
struck Drake in the neck and passed
through to the spinal column. The
! wounded soldier fell, at the same time
crying out:
"You have killed me."
Gassway immediately gave thÂ« alarm
and Drake was taken to the hospital. He
â  was completely paralyzed and it was with
1 difficulty that he was able to speak. He
! lingered a short while and died during
i the afternoon. He was a young man,
: about 20 years of age and unmarried.
; Gassway, who was crazed with grief, was
placed under arrest, and taken to the
guard house. Every one acquits him of
i any intention in the 'shooting, but the men
blame him fur his carelessness in not
. knowing his pistol was loaded. Troop F,
which is commanded by Captain Wileox.
only arrived at the Presido a few weeks
ago.
Lieutenant Colonel Henry "Wagner of !
the Fourth Cavalry, recently retired, left,
the Presidio List evening for his home;
in New York City. Colonel Wagner has
seen forty-two years of service In the
regular army. It<- enlisted in April. 1556. I
as a private In the Third Infantry, and
attain. -.1 his present rank July 13, 1898.
General Wallace F, Randolph of the
Third Artillery has reported for duty at
the Presidio, and will assume command
of that post on the departure of Colonel
Freeman, who will leave shortly on the
City of Para for the Failipplne Islands.
Colonel William A. Kobbe, who has been :
appointed by the President to command
one of the new regiments now being
formed for duty in the Philippines, is a

Another deserving appointment was

Second Oregon Regiment Will Not Be
Mustered Out Here.
The people of Oregon want their regi
ment, the Second Oregon, mustered out
in that State and they have pulled the
wires successfully. This fact is shown in
the latest order that has emanated from
Secretary of War Alger. A few weeks ago
it was stated positively that the Orrgon
boys were to be landed here, mustered out
at the Presidio and then sent to their
homes by rail with lots of travel pay to
console them on their arrival there, but
owing to the eagerness of their fellnw
statesmen this is not to be. Now me
order has come that the soldiers are to
remain aboard their transport, whi<-h will
proceed north just as soon as she has
coaled. There will be a demonstration
upon the bay, when the soldiers will get a
taste of the'welcome that the citizens are
denied giving them. The transport with
the Orfgon boys is expected in now at
any time and will certainly be here this
wp'ek It is probable that General Shaf
ter will let the regiment land and march
up Market street if the transport is to be
here some days, so that the populace may

! Father's Attempt to Curb Infant
Rights by an Invention.
New York is fast becoming: a city of
great inventors. The man who recent
ly patented a straw hat that screws on
has just been outdone by Ira H. George
of the borough of Brooklyn. Mr. George
Is evidently a father himself and knows
what it means to have a baby wake up
at 4 o'clock every morning and cry un
til ii is rocked back to sleep. He has
been greatly impressed by the woes of
his neighbors in the borough of baby
carriages. Accordingly he has invented
and just patented a device by the use
of which erring and vociferous infants
may be wooed back to sleep without
seriously disturbing the slumbers of
their parents. The invention consists
of a hammock which is to swing be
tween the footpoatÃ of the paternal bed.
At the slightest symptom of infantile
uneasiness the hammock can be given
a gentle impetus by the paternal" foot,
under the soothing influence of which
the inventor guarantees that all dis
turbing sounds will be hushed and the
drowsy god will once more reign in th*^
paternal apartment. It is understood
that, in honor of his patriotic inven
tion, Mr. George will be presented with
the freedom of the borough of Brook
lyn. â Chicago Tribune.
Inharmonious.
"No, we couldn't agree," sighed the
man. "I said I wasn't worthy of her,
and she said I was. For the sake of
harmony I yielded my opinion and said
I was worthy of her. and she, not to be
outdone in generosity, I suppose, yield
ed her opinion and said I wasn't." â De

NEW UNIFORMS
FOR THE MEN
OF THE GUARD
Inspection Report of
Second Brigade.
THE FIFTH'S NEW COLONEL
SIGNAL MEN WLLL WELCOME
THE MANILA VETERANS.
Naval Militiamen Disappointed on
Account of Delay in the Ar
rival of the Steamer
Badger.
The National Guard of the State Is. ar
o<>nling to orders, to be uniformed and
! equipped at once. Last Friday the new
board on uniforms, Major General Dick
inson, Colonel Cutter (retired) and Lieu
tenant Colonel Geipting, met, discussed
the situation and decided to prepare the
I specifications and issue them next week.
| The AV.tr Department will furnish the
j rifles, haversacks, canteens and belts.
Major Jan sen, brigade inspector of the
I Second Brigade, has forwarded his report
1 of the inspection held in the latter part
!of June to the Adjutant General. The
j brigade, he says in his report, was made
: up at the time of muster and inspection
j of Troop A, the Signal Corps, seven com-
I panics of the Fifth Infantry and four hun
â  dred ir.cn of the. First Infantry, who did
; not po to the front for obvious reason?.
He says that the men who were in the
service during the recent war with Spain
and who have returned to the guard are
â¢ noticeable for their soldierly bearing and
' discipline, and he suggests that captains
! of companies use their best endeavors to
â  retain these men in the guard as their
presence will have a strong moral effect
Which will be exceedingly beneficial. "As
i a rule," says the inspector, "changes are
! too frequent in the companies, and they
U'lid to cripple the guard."
The report gives the details of each
i muster and inspection and attention is
; called to the fact that the men are n"t
! in most of the companies uniformed, yet
in spite the fact that they were not in
regimental blue the bearing of thus.' m< n
who were in the volunteer service was
noticeable and i? mentioned favorably. In
the Fifth Regiment the companies mus
tered officers and men as follows: A, .'>7
1 out of t!4; B, 34 out of SS; D. 44 out of 77;
154 out of 114: F, 50 out of SS; G, 40 out
53, and H, 37 out of 51. The fact that
n were at work at distant points from
armories and the short notice for mus
is given as the reasons for absence.
Â»op A mustered 53 out of 59 and the
nal Corps 35 out of 38.
he inspector reports that Troop A eav
v is short tin- following State property:
j carbine; 21 revolvers, 5 cartridge box
-15 pistol holders. 2 saddles. 2 bridles,
13 saber belts and several other articles.
Captain Burnett dropped these articles
from his report, but the inspector was
unable to have any order produced for the
dropping of such missing articles. Cap
tnin Burnett stated that the revolvers
disappeared while the late Captain Jenks
was in command. Still the Inspector holds
that Captain Burnett, who was lieutenant
at the time, is responsible for t liÂ»- prop
erty, and suggests that a board of in
quiry I)-' ordered to fix the loss. He mado
such a suggestion last year in regard to
(lost property in the troop, but no heed
paid to it.
K. Whit ton. who last week was elect
colonel of the Fifth Infantry, entered
service of the State as a private of
ipany B of that regiment in March.
and in December of that year he was
cond lieutenant of the company.
A year lat< r he was elected captain, and
held that commission until l^ 4 ?, when he
was promoted major, and in April, 1890.
)\f w;is elected lieutenant colonel of the
regiment, and on the 3d inst. was honored
with the highest office the regimental of
ficers could bestow upon him. At the out
break of tho Spanish-American war the
Fifth Regiment was ready to go to the
front, but it was not accepted until there
was a second call for volunteers. Then
Colonel Whitton entered the volunteer
service as one of the majors of the Eighth
California Volunteers. Some time before
the regiment was mustered out
Major Whitton was stationed with his
battalion at the Presidio, and it was his
battalion that was so highly commended
by General Compton, the post commander,
in orders, and when the battalion was
mustered, out with the rest of the regi
ment General Cpmpton expressed his deep
regret that Major Whitton and his men
had to go.
Captain David Albert Smith, who has
been continued by Colonel Whitton as ad
jutant of the Fifth Kegiment, has for
many years been a most enthusiastic and
active "National Guardsman and It has al
ways been ills ambition to have the Guard
df his State rank first as to proficiency,
equipment and appearance. His service
in the Guard dates from the sth of Au
gust, 1872. when he enlisted as a private
in Company D, First Infantry, Remaining

FROM CHINA.
Come Millions of Pounds of Feather 3
to Supply the Trade.
The fierce tiro in a feather foundry
which took place at Newark last week
called attention to the fact that a larÃe
business is 4one In feathers, and that thÂ«
fluffy, bulky article Is an important Item
In the commercial world.
"Of course." said a large Importer of
feathors and down, "most people know
that feathfrs are not made; that they are
simply gathered off the live birds for (ho
market: but there are not many people
who know that nearly tru- whole supply,
which amounts to Beveral million pounds
a year in this country, comes here from
China via Germany. In China the fpath
ers are gathered By small dealers ,\m\
commission merchants through the coun
try, and the stock rinds its way linaily to
Hongkong, where the large packing and
cleaning establishments .-ire situated.
Some feathers are nfade ready for the
consumer there, but the largest part- of
the product Is sent raw to Europe, where
the dusting and renovating take place.
One of the largest plants In Europe is in
Prague, where the factories of the con
cern which had the loss in Newark are lo
cated:"
The duty on raw feathers is ir> per c?n{
and 30 per cent on the manufactured b
cleaned article, and in order to save Â»>
part of the extra 35 per cent factories
have been established here. The raw ma
terial comes to the United States in bales
which have been reduced in size b\
hydraulic pressure and contain about 4(hÂ»
pounds each.
Feathers which remain in Europe are
used to a great extent "for feather be>!rÂ».
but of the material which comes to this
"country the largest part is used for pil
lows and cushions:
"The ordinary pillow." said a. manufac
turer, "eats up 75 per cent of the supply,
and the rest goes to miscellaneous ln<l
ding. and the down which is selected
from the feathers and comes. In some in
stances, already selected, is used for
fancy cushions of the better grade and
for bed covers. Feather beds, the old
fashioned article, which come here from
Germany and Ireland, are going out of
date rapidly, and even the East Slders
make pillows of their beds after they
h*VS been in the country a few years.
New York is no place for feather bods,
anyway, even if the people wanted th:m.
In 'apartments like those in the old-fash
ioned New England homes a mountain
of feathers may be housed, but in flats,
which are so small that the occupants
must use condensed milk, the feathnr bel
can have no place." â New York Tribune.
Making Arrangements.
"I want to get up a popular demonstra
tion." said the Paris agitator.
"When does monsieur desire it?"
"Tn-mnrrow."
"I'm very sorry, hut monsieur's rivnl
has engaged the mob for to-morrow. But
day after to-morrow it will be disen
gaged."âWashington Star.

An Honored Place in the American
Hierarchy Is Predicted for the
Young San Francisco
Clergyman.
Rev. P. C. Yorke. the well-known priest
and lecturer of this city, has been the
center of admiration among the students
and professors of the Irish Catholic Sem
inary of Maynooth. In fact, he has been
the recipient of the warmest congratu
lations from the mosteminent and learned
of the Irish Bishops. He read a paper at
the annual meeting: of the Alumni Asso
ciation of Maynooth College, and awoke
the next morning to find' himself famous
through the length and breadth of the
Emerald Tsle.
Recent copies of the Freeman's Journal,
the most influential and widely circulated
paper in Ireland, which have just been
received in this city, contain a full ac
count of Father Yorke's reception. May
nooth College is one of the greatest sem
inaries of the Catholic church. It has
over COO students, all studying for the
priesthood. Father Yorke sperit some
years there before he determined to cast
his lot in the I'nited States.
The meeting of the alumni at which
Father Tnrke read his jiaper was attend
ed by Cardinal Logue, primate of Ireland,
twenty Bishopa and over 300 priests. The
Freeman's Journal gives the following
account of the San Francisco priest:

read an eloquent paper on 'Certain As
pects of Clerical Education.' He summa
rized his paper as follows: 'Clerical edu
cation was a delicate subject to treat,
but wholesome criticism and candid dis
cussion were the life of the Maynooth
Union. Maynooth should be a center of
Catholic intellectual life and the head
quarters of an aggressive propaganda, of
Catholicism. Do the Irish people hold in
Intellectual matters the place to which
their numbers would entitle them? The
penal laws and the absence <>f a Catholic
university do not fully explain or excuse
our deficiencies; the dearth of Catholic
writers, the defects of our educational
system, the absence of any attempt to
advance popular education, the want of
a sound Catholic tone in public life. In
bettering the condition of things the
priests of Ireland must take the initiative,
and Maynooth must train the priests. The
literary training of priests should be their
training with a view to popular organiza
tion.'
"He advocated a short course for ordi
nary students, a long course for students
of more ability and urged the necessityof
encouraging students to specialize. The
trustees had already made some regula
tions In this direction which was one of
the most encouraging signs of their alma
mater. He had treated the education of
th<- priest from the point of view of a
public man and a representative of the
great church of God. In conclusion father
Yorke said: 'Your glory is the glory of
the Irish race and your triumph is shared
equally by us. We stand under the Amer
ican flag not as strangers or hirelings, but
as citizens who have contributed as many
civic virtues to the brightness of its stars
as any other nation and whose blood has
flown as free that it may stand secure.
But we are no worse citizens of the great
republic because we honor the motherland
from wliieh our race has sprung. Wo
look to >ou with pride. If at times we
peem to chide it is our love alone that
speaks. Ireland never grows old. To the
traveler across the desert sea her holy
hills are ever fresh and fair; her people
an- iike the eagle that renews its youth.
St Patrick has impressed on this land his
own characteristics, and. standing on the
threshold of the new century, you are
girt with strength to run the race und
renew the glory of ancient days. May
these glories grow with the returning
years and. chief among them, the renown
of this college which has taken up the
traditions of Armagh. Bangor and Clon
macredise. and through the gracious
providence and justice of our father's
God is destined to surpass them all.' "
Of the paper Cardinal Lodge said "it
was the most beautiful he had ever
read at a public meeting." Most Rev.
Bishop Clancy said: "It appeared to him
that if other evidence were absent of the
work Maynooth wa.s doing. Father Yorke
himself would be the most magnificent
specimen. He combined logic imagina
tion and eloquence of the highest order.
it was said formerly that light came from
the east. He thought to-day they saw
light coming from the Wept. In the futuvo
he had no doubt Father Yorke would
grace the American hierarchy by his pres
ence, and then his views which had been
so eloquently expressed would prove most
useful in the hierarchy of that country
in developing ecclesiastical systems of
education."
At the dinner which followed, after the
two principal toasts had been prop
the whole body of priests called for
Father Yorke. In consequence of the uni
versal demand Cardinal Logue, who pre
sided culled on the reverend gentleman.
who made a lengthy and most eloquent
address, which was received with the
greatest enthusiasm. One of the profes
sors of the college who contributed a spe
cial article to the Freeman's. Journal on
the meeting says nf Father Yorke's pa
per: "The lecture was full of wondoiful
Bashes of eloquence, which were received
with rounds of applause. It wound up
with a touching reference to Ireland's
past and future prospects and to the love
with which the Irish abroad look across
the ocean to their kindred in Ireland."
Father Yorke will spend some time in
Ireland and then return to San Francisco.
He is expected here in October.
PEPPINA'S DUES,
Or the Way the Italian Queen's Maid
Grew Rich.
The following story comes from Rome;
Queen Margharita has known for a lons
time that her dress bills were enormously
high but, having an old and trusted mud
who did all htr shopping or ordered tho
royal tradesmen to bring their goods to
the palace for her Majesty to see, sup
posed that ph.- wns not overcharged. Kut
on one dark day for the maid she fell ill,
and the Queen, having need of a very
simple frnck. one of her ladies in waiting
was desired to undertake the commission.
"Go to X.," said the maid, with anxiety:
"they always serve her Majesty." And
accordingly Mme. de paid a visit to
th.it establishment.
"A thousand francs for a plain pique
gown? Impossible!"
"1 regret very much, madame, said the
shopman politely, "but 400 francs for the
gown is not excessive, and then there are
Pepnina's dues.'"
"Peppina! Who is Peppina?" Interrupt
ed the astonished lady. "What has th.it
person to do with her Majesty's affair^?
"Everything; she is the Queen's maid,
and always insists on having more than
50 per cent on every purchase."
That night Peppina left the Quinnal a
sadder but wiser woman, but not by any
means a poor one. Her "perks " legiti
mate and otherwise, while maid to her
Majesty, were enormous. Not least among
them was her royal mistress' wardrobe,
which passed to ber so little used that to
the ordinary eye it was without blemish.
Twice a year Peppina had a sale which
was largely attended by Americans, who
gave (.xagpernted p rices to possess a
gown actually worn by royalty.â Now

vnung lady by calling hrr a gentle lamb

THE PRIX DE ROME.
Ordeal for Art Students to Undergo
to Obtain It.
A promise has been made to lodge art i
students competing for the Prix de Home \
in the Palai c at Compiegne, but it has not â 
;i s yet been kept. The ten select*
compete must meditate in cells at the
Boole _es Beaux Arts. The ordeaJ to
which competitors are subjected was be
gun to-day. They are to work in solitary
confinement during seventy-two days, but
the first thirty-six hours are the most
trying The cell is barer than any In a
monastery where the crucifix relieves the
blankness "of the walls. All the furniture
would not fetch 100 francs at the auction
mart It consists of a mattress, pillow â¢
and bolster, a rush mat. an easel, a chair
and a small table. There is nothing else.
As light comes from above, there is no
outlook.
The competitor is thrown completely
upon himself, but especially during the
first three days. He is then deprived of
all communication with the outside world,
and is to all intents and purposes in jail. .
The Bketch of his competing picture must
be made in that time. He may subse
; quently modify his design, but must not
i change the main features. The figures are ;
to keep their original attitudes, no figure
! in to be withdrawn and the design Is to be
I duplicated. One of the two drawings is j
sealed up and sent to a jury. The student
keeps the other. This done, the door of,
the cell is unlocked, the occupant can ko
in and out, pay but not receive visits, and
1 is free to take his meals where he pleases.
He may take his drawing to his master i
and consult with him as to the best means
of hiding general detects or enhancing I
what is meritorious by means of changes
in detail and by effects of color.
It sometimes happens that there is a
triplicate, BO that a copy may be given to i
the professor should he be- disposed to ;
work it up.. But this is against the spirit :
of the rules. In point of fact it is rare
Dot to see the master hand in the Prix de
Rome paintings when they are finished
and ready to be exhibited. The subjects j
are chosen by the jury, and generally are
classical or Historical, and demand what
! is termed here a noble style of treat
' ment. Plutarch's Tacftus and Caesar are j
the great purveyors of subjects. Scenes :
from sacred history are sometimes
chosen. There Is no more uninteresting
exhibition than that of the Prix de Home, j
Seldom, Indeed, is originality shown, or
the promise of future excellence given.
Most of the pictures are, so to speak.
choked according to recipe, wanting in
expression and crude in coloring.
To obtain a Prix de Rome enables the
student to complete his art education in
Italy at the cosi of the State. When
j there h^ lives at the Villa dc Medici, and
is under the special patronage of the
French Erabassador. The stay in Honi'3
: widens his esthetic views, and awakens
perhaps the historical sense, for Rome is
( a museum city. It is of the most service
: to students who devote themselves to re
j ligious arts and portraits. It certainly
helps them to understand Italian art 0%

Both Sorry.
A well-known New Yorker who has
just rpturnpd from Kurope tells the fol
lowing story: ,
"I was dining with an English friend
lin a Paris cafe. A young Austrian
whom I hnd mot in my travels ap
proached the table, and a short conver
sation followed between him and my
self in German. Ho soon excused him
j self and left the place. Then my Eng-
I lish friend spoke â¢'â¢Â»â¢
" 'Awfully sorry for that young chap,
don't you know.'
" 'Why?' I asked.
j " 'Because he couldn't ppeak Kngliah.'
" 'That's very odd.' I remarked, 'for
! he said to me just before he left that
j that it was a pity that you couldn't
speak anything but English.' "â New
lYork Tribune.

had fin. ..l reason to believe Baker was in the Florence House. They were in
structed to make themselves certain on the point, and in a few minutes they
telephoned the Chief that he was there. The Chief detailed all the detectives
on duty to hurry to the Florence House and take all the men they came
across on the way and surround the house, so that Baker could not escape.
Inspector Morrissey, who happened to be at police headquarters, went with
them.
Men wore stationed at all the exits from the house, nnd Detectives Rey
nolds and Ed Gibson went upstairs and asked the landlady to show them to
Baker's room. He occupied No. 39, and when they opened the door Baker was
sitting on the bed reading a book. He had shaved off his heavy black beard,
which considerably altered his appearance. The entrance of the detectives
was a surprise to him, but he did not offer any resistance. He begged Rey
nolds not to put the handcuffs on him, but the detective said fie would take no
chances, and placed the bracelets <:n his wrists. The room was packed with
provisions, (showing that linker was preparing for a long siege.
The unusual number of officers at such a frequented part of the city at
such an hour, between 10 and 11 o'clock, attracted quite a crowd, and all sorts
of guesses were made as to the prisoner's identity when he appeared on the
street handcuffed to Reynolds.
Captain Dugan left for Sacramento yesterday morning in the hope that he
might come a ross Baker there, but as soon as the capture was made chief
I.ees sent dispatches to intercept him. The Chief also wired to chief Inspector
Watts. Bi ston, and received a reply, "Good. Thanks."
Inspector Morrissey said that Baker was a member of the Entries, and in
Seattle that organization provided the funds to fight his extradition. He was
expelled from the organization abdut a mouth ago and the tight was aban
doned. Chief Lees said he was satisfied that Baker's escape was planned be
fore he left the City Prison Thursday evening, and he lias a strong suspicion
thai Baker was assisted and protected by a fraternal body since his arrival
in this city. Baker will probably leave for Boston to stand his trial to-day.

HORSE. DOG AND RABBITâ Torr.
Moro, Or. There never has hern a rec
ord of a race against time hv "horse, dog
and rabbit for a quarter of a mile." nor
is it possible to arrange sucn a race, as
the dog and rabbit cannot be controlled
to follow a course that would be taken by
a horse guided by his rider. Which would
cover the greatest distance in the time
that it would take a first .lass horse to
covei a quarter of a mile would depend
on the conditions, but generally speaking
it is safe to say that for a quarter of a
mile a horse will beat a dog, and a dog a
rabbit.

met you"; the same with the gentleman.
Neither is required to make use of the
words unless really pleased to have be
come acquainted. It' neither is pleased
etiquette does not require either party to
tell an untruth, but politeness requires
that on parting the parti' s should bow or
pass the time of day. as "good day,"
"good afternoon" or "good evening." as
the time may suggest. If a lady, on being
introduced, hears the phrase from the
other party. "I am pleased to meet you,'
and she does not care to continue the ac
quaintance, she should simply bow and
then enter into general conversation, so
as not to appear rude.
CANNING FRUITâ W. B. C, Watson
vllle, Cal. The first great art in canning
fruit is to seal hermetically the vessel m
which it is placed so a> to exclude the- air.
Heat is used to vaporise all air that may
be in the inteistices between the fruit, so
that the natural juices and the solid mat
ter alone remain in the can. After the
fruit is cleaned a syrup should be pre
pared by adding one pound or half a
pound of sugar, as the fruit may be more'
or less acid, to a pint of water. The syrup
is placed in a suitable vessel (clean cop
per Is the best) and it is allowed to coma
gradually to a boil. Then there is put In
as much" fruit as the syrup will cover and
the whole is allowed to come to a boiling
pitch. The fruit is then removed ana
placed in the cans and filled to the edge
with syrup, and the cover Is then put on
as quickly as possible. Some then plica
the cans in a bath of boiling water and
make a small hole in the top of the can.
and when the water comes to a boil tint
heats the contents of the can and forces
out the air, and then the small hole is
soldered. -
POSTAGE STAMPSâ V. R.. City. In
what is known as the "language of post
ape stamps" if the stamp placer] on the
envelope is inverted on the upper right
hand corner it means that the person
written tc la to write no more. If in
verted on the upper left hand corner it
n'tn.is that the writer declares affection
for the receiver of the letter. If tho stamp
ia in the center at the top that means
an affirmative to the question or a ques
tion as the i ase may he. When at the
bottom in the center it means a negative
If the stamp la at right angles with the
envelope, upper right hand corner, it
means "Does the receiver love the send
er?" If in the left hand corner it mo.ins
thai the writer hates the other. The
stamp placed diagonally on the upper
right hand corner means that the writer
desires in* &cqoamtaÂ»se of the receiver,
find if placed in o similar position on the
left hand coraer it means "I desire your
friendship." To place the stamp on a line
with the- surname means on the part of
the writer "Accept my love." If the party
to whom the letter is addressed Is al
ready engaged the answer is Riven by
plai'iusr the stamp in the same position
but reversing it. Any number of com
binations enn be made by correspondents.
The post clerks who have to cancel the
stamps say that when the stamps are
placed on any part of the envelope ex
cept the right upper corner it means tnat
the writers are giving the mail elerka a
great deal of unnecessary trouble.OAKLAND AND SUBURBS
MILLER WHS
ONCE OPPOSED
BY THE MAYOR
H. N. Morse Enters
the Arena.
HAS A CAMPAIGN LETTER
MR. SNOW ONCE SAID, "HE IS
TOO EXPENSIVE."
The Whole Trouble Caused by Some
Politicians to Whom Miller
Lends a Too Willing
Ear.
Call,
: â 
A political sensation was sprung to-day
when ) fairy X. Morse, an ex-Sheriff of
this county, made public some brief cor
respondence he had witli Mayor Snow
prior to election. It explains the whole
situation at the City Hal!.
About a month before the election Mr.
Morse wrote to Mr. Snow; Then Auditor,
asking him that if M. K. .Miller. Superin
tendent of Streets, wen- defeated for City
Engineer, would !;â¢â  (Snow); is Mayor,
vote to reinstate Mr. Miller In his present
position.
Mr. Snow's reply was â written on the
Fame sheet of paper and returned to Mr.
Morse. The complete reply was: "No, he
Is too expensive. Would try to lind a bet
ter man. R. W. S."
The Mayor does not show any desire to
discuss this mutter further than to say
â that he had much correspondence with
Mr. Morse, and. that the published letter
Is doubtless one of the many that passed
between them. Mr. Snow, while not v. â¢I -
coming the publication at this time, says
that if it has been produced with the in
tention of trying to Induce him to depose
Mr. Miller, it will probably have the op
posite effect. -
The Mayor considers that the Miller in
cident has received altogether too much
attention from people who affect to be his
friends. Mr. Snow is on record as saying
that he would probably take favorable
action on Mr. Dow's resolution to re-elect
Mr. Miller when the question shall have
been discussed in committee of the whole.
One of Mr. Miller's very strongest polit
ical friends and supporurs said this after
noon: "I have advised Miller many times
not to stir up this fuss. Miller is a splen
Â«iid Street Superintendent, but an abso
lute child at the game of politics. The
Mayor in his reports has shown that Mr.
Miller has conducted his office on a busi
nesslike basis, and it is very impolitic to
try t" jam the Mayor into voting for Mr.
Miller after hÂ« has" stated that Mr. Miller
is in office and that there is no intention
of removing him."

The Morgue and Its Surroundings
Suddenly Occupies a Promi

Coroner Mehrmann Is not anxious to be
auties of providing a
Morgue. He is the first Coroner who has
publicly expressed himself as. beinK op
posed tii what Is undoubtedly one of the
choici si perquisites of the Coroner's
â 
Next Monday District Attorney Allen
will present to the Supervisors his report
regarding the establishment of a county
Morgue. He will say that there is no
doubt whatever regarding thÂ« authority
of th( county to establish a Morgue, if it
consider such a step desirable. He is not
sure, however, that the Coroner can be
forced to use the Morgue provided by the
county If it does not please him to do so.
Dr. "Mehrmann declares he will be per
fectly willing to accept the use of a pub
lic Morgue should "the county provide one,
but â . The Coroner also says that with
the Morgue there must be a proper num
ber of deputies, proper furnishings,
proper accommodations and a proper
Morgue wagon and horses. ,In other
words; the Morgue will cost the county,
should Coroner Mehrmann have his way.
about three time? as much as it now
costs under the system of permitting the
Coroner to locate the Morgue wherever he
sees fit.
Before election Dr. Mehrmann frequent
ly stated that he wanted the Morgue to
be free of any man's private undertak
ing the establishment. He favored a pub
lic Morgue all the time. In an interview
he says: "If one be provided for me, 1
shall 'insist on getting the things that
ought to go with it. One of these Is a
horse" and d. ad wagon. Besides the
Morgue room proper, there must be an in
quest room of suitable size and a parlor
for the accommodation of visitors. I want
two deputies, also, for one man cannot do
the bard work of lifting bodies in and out
of the wagon." .
An estimate of the conduct of a public
Morgue 'for this 'county has been made
as follows: In addition to the original
cost of about $3000 for Morgue, horses,
wagon and furniture. .
Falary of chief deputy. $100 per mo â $1200 01

TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS.
Humor Produced by Efforts of the
Intelligent Compositor.
The intelligent compositor is something
"f a humorist, and not always an ttneon-
scious humorist either. Some of his great
est feata have occurred in Philadelphia,
where the great editors write a very exe
crably bad manuscript. In one case a
correspondent, who was describing ;i tar
ring and feathering .scene at which he
was present only in a professional ca
pacity, was made to say "getting the
feathers ready for us." Instead of "ready
for use.'" The same newspaper office had
a printer who turned the expression "frnm
alpha to omega" into "from apples to
oranges." and conveyed the impression
that somebody had set the Delaware river
on fire by calling ferry boats "fiery hosts."
A cooking school called the "New (Vn
lurv" was cruelly made to appear as the
"New Cemetery," and doubtless the same
pessimistic type < hanged the "Masque of
Pandora" into the "Morgue of Pandora."
A diver who had found two old bells in
the Delaware went before the public as a
"driver" who had found "two < Id bills."
The scripture allusion to the leaven that
"leaveneth the whole lump" was pervert
ed Into the startling agricultural an
nouncement that the leaven had leavened
"the whole turnip."
A foreign editor who wrote that the
P.ritish lion was "shaking his mane". was
edified th" next morninff with the an
n'Hincemenf, on his authority, that the
national animal in question was "skating
in Maine." A more natural error was
that which called "a member of the leg
islature" a "member of the liquor store."
One of the Philadelphia morning papers,
which formerly gave close attention to
marine news, informed its readers on one
occasion that the bark Bessy Jnne had ar
rived at Honolulu "with an oil well on
board." Investigation proved that there
was nothing in the report except "all well
on board." An old-time Inn named the
"Star and Garter Hotel" was once re
christened by a printer as "the Shoe and
Garter Hotel." A foreign dispatch about
the war between Russia and Turkey con
tained an allusion to transports convoyed
by gunboat p. which was turned into the
novel announcement that the transports
W p re "conveyed by goats."â Harper's
Rotfnd Table.
Why the "Help" Left.
Younsr Mistressâ l don't see why you
should leave me so suddenly. I'm sure
I've done all I could to help you with the
housework, and I have done all the cook-
lnÂ«r-

OAKTjAND, July B.â LÂ»ittle Divining Pamante. the six-year-old son of a
Portuguese laborer residing at Third and linden streets, was attacked by a
ferocious dog this afternoon while playing in the front of his father's home
and his left eye was all but torn from its socket. Fortunately, the savage
animal's teeth did not pierce the eyeball, but both above and below the
eye was a deep and ugly lacerated wound, for which the child was treated
at the Receiving Hospital by Dr. Rowe. The wounds required five stitches.

Senger of the Tniversity of California to
day, lie brought letters from the 'Gov
ernor of New Zealand stating that he was

Dticipates more light from the Ameri

Captain Bourne was shown over the
grounds and buildings of the State in

all the details of its organization and
management, expressing amazement at
the fact that the requirements at Berke

CAN ANIMALS COUNT P
Russian Experimented Declares That
They Undoubtedly Can.
Most, people have seen performing ani
mals in circuses and music halls who are
appan ntly accomplished mathematicians.
Performances of this sort, however, are
Of little scientific value owing to the larji' 1
element of trickery generally involved in
them. A secret sign from the impresario
to the animal frequently proves the sole
explanation of its apparent cleverness.
Dr. Timofi.'ff is a Russian doctor, who
has made exhaustive experiments in ani

In a village of the Government of Po
kow Dr. Timotieff studied a horse belong
ing to a peasant, and found that the horse
always stopped at the end of Its twen
tieth furrow. It did not Stop when tired,
but only after every twenty furrows.
It was so exact about this that its mas
ter reckoned the number of furrows that
he had made by the number of times
that the horse halted. The animal count
ed for the man. one day this physician
was going to Valdai, wnen at the twenty
second verst one of the horses hitched to
the troika (a three-horse carriage)
stopped suddenly. The driver got down
from his seat, gave some provender to the
horse, and drove on.
This horse had been trained by its mas
ter when very young to get food at every
twenty-five versts. There can be no doubt
that ihe horse kept count l>y the posts
along the road, it had made a mistake
this time of three versts. but it was not
its fault. Along the road there were three
other posts besides the telegraph posts
which looked very much like them. Hence
the error of three versts.
This same horse was accustomed to get
its food in a stable near which the town
clock rang at noon. Dr. Timofleff him
self saw the horse pick up its ears and
listen, but drop its head dissatisfied
when less than twelve strokes sounded.
On the contrary, it manifested all kinds
of satisfaction when it heard the twelfth
stroke of the bell, neighing for its prov
ender.âLondon Mail.
Facts From the Philippines.
Commander John D. Ford, just now re
turned from Manila, plainly states that
thp American army now hofds less ground
around the Philippine metropolis than at
any time within the past four months;
that the Filipino lines, pushed back again
and again by brilliant sorties, return to
their original position almost imme
diately and have actually gained on the
Americans at many places. It may be
added to this that no army of the size
of that now battling in Luzon can stand
a drain of fifteen or twenty killed, fifty
or more wounded and as many sick each
day without being soon reduced to a
minimum of effective strength. An army
large enough and effective enough to set

ed as siMiii as possibly. As auxiliaries of

Fender Cushions.
From England comes word of fender
cushions in lieu of -hearthrugs. These
cushions are made Quite two feet in width
and tit around the fender at the floor line
following the curve quite to the jambs of

entered into between Bishop Nichols, the
special committee of the Church of the
Advi nt appointed to secuK the rector's
resignation and Rev. Marshall Law has
Juki been divulged. It cost the Church of
the Advent $40:> &i to get rid of its pastor.
This a/nount consists of his salary for
the months of August and September, the
usual alms to the rector for charitable
purposes and transportation for himself
and his family to Boston. And as yet Dr.
Law's resignation is not in existence, al
though there is a verbal promise that ho
will not come back on the vestry for more.
At the little conference an agreement
was produced, of which there are three
copies In existence. One is kept by Bishop
Nichols, one by the committee and one by
Dr. Law. By its terms the vestry agrees
to pay the stated sum to the rector and
he agret s to go away to Boston on an j
ostensible vacation until September 30,
but befi.ro that date lie undertakes to
send in his resignation. This contract is
not signed by anybody, but was formally ;
agreed upon in the presence of the Bishop, j
so that tin parties to it could back out.
All the mon^y has been paid and the
church treasurer holds the rector's re- .
ceipt.
A letter highly eulogistic of Dr. Law
had been prepared to give him by the
vestry; but he will never receive it. Ow
ing to the opposition shown by the rector
toward she plans of tin- vestry it was
decided that the letter should not be used.
The rector is now at liberty to go to Bos
ton with his son. and transportation will
also be furnished his wife and other child
as soon as he is ready for them to join
him.
Much surprise has been expressed that
.1. .1. Valentine should not have given the
rector a pass and saved him that much
coin. In past years the church circular
has frequently mentioned the fact that
Senior Warden J. J. Valentine "made
transportation easy," ami the rector"s
friends assert that it would nut have hurt
tli.- wealthy president of wviis-Fargo to !
have extended this little courtesy to the
rector, who has been so very loyal in his
admiration for the senior warden.
The Church of the Advent is now look
ing for another rector, although should
one be found he cannot he installed until
the resignation of Rev. Marshall Law has
been received.
CURIOUS EXHIBIT
Of the Novel Appliances Used in Ger-
many for Nursing the Sick.
The practical $=ide of the German na
tion is illustrated in the exhibition for
the nursing of the sick which has just
been opened in Berlin. It is said to
be very complete, and to contain many
interesting novelties in the way of new
medical appliances. It includes a num
ber of model sickrooms fitted up and
arranged for different diseases â a sick
room in the tropic?, a field hospital, a
department for invalid cookery, a de
partment for medicines and nourishing
foods, a department for gymnastic and
orthopoedic apparatus, a disinfecting
chamber, a complete Roentgen ray out
fit, etc. Among the more curious ex
hibits are some tinned provisions left
from the Franco-Prussian war and still
perfectly fresh, a very ingenious mech
anism, the invention of a Roumanian
doctor, to produce deep and regular
respiration by mechanical pressure ap
plied by pads placed around the body
and kept working by an electromotor,
and lastly, a patent bed to hang up be
tween trees, which Its inventor, a.
Transylvanian, declares to be an in
fallible cure for insomnia and also for
throat diseases. It is superior to a
hammock because it can also be used
as a boat, in which case the prater
proof cover is fastened over the lower
part of the frame, while other parts
of the frame are screwed together to
make a paddle. This inventor says that
he has traveled considerable distances
by river in one of these contrivances.

HAMLET PRODUCED
By the Members of Russia's Imperial
Family.
Shakespeare's "Hamlet" has recently
had a more notable presentation than
the one in which Mme. Bornhardt takes
the role of the melancholy Dane. It
was in St. Petersburg, and the cast was
imperial. EvÂ«ry part â of actors, act
resses, prompter and all the rest â was
taken by a member i/f the reigning fam
ily, and these high personages entered
into the work with quite as much en
thusiasm and energy as any company
to whom the proceeds meant bread and
butter could possibly have done. Grand
Duke Constantine, who took the role of
Hamlet, had been preparing for nearly
a year, and his last visit to England
was made for the sole object of con
sulting Irving, from whom lie received
a month's drilling. It is said that Irv
ing expressed himself surprised at the
Duke's progress, highly complimenting
him upon his acting. "Not half of the
actors on the English stage." said Irv
ing, "can boast of your dramatic talent.
To become a trup artist would require
a vast amount of work on your part,
but you are capable of doing it. and,"
he laughingly added, '"whenever your
duked"in is taken from you come to
me; I shall always be pleased to give
you a role." â Chicago Record.
Double Proof.
"Do you believe in heredity, Mrs.
Simpson?"

has I can trace right back to his fath
er."
"Does his father believe in heredity,
too?"
"Yes. He traces Bobby's faults all
back to me." â (TVago Record.
Equal to the Emergency.
"Lend me $5,' said the man who never
repays.

POOLROOMS MAY
RUN UNCHECKED
Marin Supervisors Re
fuse to Act.
M'ISAAC MAKES A VAIN PLEA
DISTRICT ATTORNEY IS DENIED
tjUPPOxIT.
Wants to Bring Civil Proceedings
Against the Gamblers, but the
Board vÂ« ill Not Author
ize the Move.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, July B.â For some
reason the Board of Supervisors of
Marin County has seen fit to throw cold
water upon the proposition to abolish
the poolrooms at Sausalito. In pur
suance of his policy to abate what is
alleged to be a nuisance and a menace
to public morals. District Attorney Mc-
Isaac appeared before the board to-day
and asked that he be given its indi
vidual support in taking further steps
to suppress the poolroom evil. When
he had finished, the board members,
without giving the question any con
sideration, voiced their belief that
"Sausalito is all right and should be
left to settle its own destinies."
In asking for the sanction of the
board to take further action, Mclsaac
drew attention to an act of the last
Legislature empowering the District
Attorneys of the various counties to
take such steps as they 'might deem
necessary to abate public nuisances.
He then presented the following reso
lution and asked that it be adopted by
the board:
Whereas, A public nuisance exists in
the county of Marin in the form of pool
rooms in the town of Sausalito; be it
Kesolved, That the District Attorney is
hereby ordered and directed to bring a
civil action in the name of the people of
the State of California to abate such pub
lic nuisance.
In making his request Mclsaao said
the poolrooms hs conducted at Sausa
lito were a disgrace to any county, and
should be suppressed. He said criminal
actions had failed, but that, in his
opinion, a civil suit would nave the
desired result.
The apathy and indifference manifest- j
ed by the board were so marked that
finally he took his documents and left
the room in disgust.
Chairman Ban- says Sausalito is
capable of looking after itself. He
doesn't know whether or not he would
favor any action by the board, even if
the people there petitioned for an
abolition of the evil. Supervisor Ring's ;
ideas were characteristic. He said:
â â Sausalito is all right. Let her do as
she pleases. It is nobody else's pie.
They have good people down there, and
I am not for interfering if I know my
self, and I think 1 do."
HIS BUSINESS.
Was to Sell Trick Fixtures to Saloon
Keepers.
"I used to be in the queerest business
in the world," said Louis Augustine, a
salesman now traveling for a Chicago
notion house. "1 was an agent for trick
fixtures for bars. About fifteen years
ago there was a craze for that kind of
thing, and saloons "with innumerable
mechanical contrivances for practical
jokes sprang up all over the country.
The house I worked for made a special
ty tif equipping such establishments
throughout and had it reduced to a
science. We pi.'* in trick plants in
Chicago, San Francisco. Omaha, Den
ver, Milwaukee, Cincinnati, Louisville,
Washington, New York. Newark, Buf
falo, Indianapolis, Detroit, Kansas City
and a score of other places. Some of
them were very elaborate, and it was
certainly ludicrous to see a victim
make a circuit of the premises.
"The innocent looking cigar lighter
would spout water instead of fire; the
call bell on the table gave one an elec
tric shock; so did the arms of any easy
chair; an artificial snake popped out of
the telephone box when the re-'eiver
was taken down; the viands on the
lunch counter \v re all made of papier
macho, and the platform of a weigh
ing machine would buck like a kicking
horse. The worst sell of the lot, and
the feature that ultimately led to dis
carding such tricks, was the collapsible
stairway, which would suddenly fold up
under a man's feet and treat him to an
unexpected toboggan slide. It was
usually reserved as a final torture, and
it was only a matter of time when some
victim would land on the floor with a
broken limb. f least half a dozen
cases I could cite resulted in heavy
damage suitn. and in the very nature of
things the popularity of the trick pa-loon
was necossarllv short-lived. At the
outset such a place would be a great
success, for the simple reason that each
fellow who was sold immediately
rushed for a fresh dupe to get even,
but after a while the supply of raw ma
terial was bound to run short and the
jokps became stale and flat. It was im
possible to keep them varied on ac
count of the cost of the apparatus, and
the craze wore itself out in a few years.
At present only two houses of that kind
are In existence In the whole country."
WOMAN'S HAT
Fooled a Judge, and He Ordered It
Removed, But Changed His Mind.
A young woman whose attire included a
crash hat perched jauntily upon her head. !
a White ministerial collar, a bow tie and '
a jacket with wide lapels entered Judge
Stein's courtroom Monday afternoon and i
occupied a chair at a table within the bar |
rail. Soon after the appearance of the !
newcomer Judge Stein happened to glance '
in her direction. The Intervening table
prevented his Honor from getting- a full
view of the young woman. He saw the i
hat, coat, necktie and collar, however.
Motioning to Bailiff H>aly, he said: L
"Go over and tell that young man to re- !
move his hat."
"Why. that is a woman, your Honor," i
protested the bailiff.
"A woman?" queried the court, straight- :
ening op and gazing doubtingly. "Well, )
never mind, then." continued his Honor, |
settling back in his chair and chuckling 'â 
to himself. Old court attaches say that j
Judge Stein seldom smiles, while on the
bench, but this time he laughed softly to i
himself for fifteen minutes.â Chicago j

CHANGING NAME IN ENGLAND.
Applications Granted by the Crown
Only for Good Reasons.
Now. the crown has the absolute right
to grant or withhold at its pleasure its
license and authority for a change of
name, and if all one hears be correct al
most as many applications are refused as
are granted. Needless to say, the re
fusals are not the personal refusals of her
Majesty, but emanate from the home of
fice, through which all petitions pass, and
the home office has assumed to Itself the*
decisijn as to whether or not a case shall'
be put forward for the personal consider
ation of her Majesty. In no circumstance
can any one compel either the home of
fice to put forward a petition or her Maj
esty to grant her license. But, judgin*
from past experience, one is able to in
dicate generally the capes In which an
application Is likely to be successful. To
begin with, no case has ever been known
in which the crown has refused us li
cense for any change or assumption
which is in conformity with either a will
or settlement, so that it may be taken
for granted that any application for -i
royal license in i>ursuanee of either a
will or settlement will be granted with
out the least difficulty beinn raised.
Applicants desiring to assume a name
undor other circumstances must show
what the crown can consider to be good
and sufficient reason why the change
should be effected. The refusals as to
which one hears occasionally do not all
Beem to be Indicated from identical rea
sons, but it is difficult to get exact par
ticulars of such casts, and though one
would hesitate to say that the granting
of a royal license upon a voluntary appli
cation was a matter of the caprice of the
crown or its officers, one cannot, however,
definitely say that such and such a case
would be invariably refused. Consequent
ly one can only indicate the probabilities
of consent or refusal. These will usually
be found to be somewhat as follows,
though, as each caso has its special cir
cumstances, it is naturally difficult to
speak with any certainty.
An application to assume a name where
no descent can be shown from any family
of such name and where it is merely a
mattr-r of personal caprice is almost in
variably refused. An application to assume
the name of a family rrom whom di
in the female line exists is generally
granted if it can t>e shown that the fe
male ancestor of that name through
whom descent is proved was an heraldic
heiress in 'blood, or whpre the applicant
can show that he is an heir of line of any
male of that family. An application put
forward in :i case of adoption to assume
the name of the guardian is usually
granted if the application is made by the
guardian and in his lifetime:- but the mat
ter is on an entirely different footing if
the application is made merely at the ca
price of the ward, and after the death
of the guardian, whon the latter has left
behind him no indication of his wish that
his ward should adopt his name. An ap
plication to assume the particle "De" In
front of a name is usually granted where
unquestionable evidence can be" procured
of descent from an ancestor who so wrote
his name.
The application of a husband to assume
his wife's name is usally governed by the
fact of the heirship or otherwise of the
wife. If she be an heiress in blood the ap
plication is usually granted, but if not,
infrequently refused in cases to the con
trary. But the crown does not sanction
the assumption of a name by the wife
while her husband fs alive, unless the hus
band joins in the petition to assume the
same name.â Genealogical Magazine.

BLONDINED DOG.

"During the occupation of Paris at
the close of the Franco-Prussian war,"
said a veterinary surgeon â¢ ' this city,
"the Frenchmen used to catch the small
white poodles belonging to German of

blue dye and their forequarters in red,
transforming them into animated cop
ies of the French flag, greatly to the
wrath and disgust of their owners. The

Which I have any personal knowledge
came under my observation a few
weeks ago, when a lad brought me a
pet spaniel to treat for an ulcerated
paw. The little fellow was a sort of
tawny yellow, quite different from any
spaniel I had ever seen, but when I
came to examine him closely I found
that he had been 'blondined ' exidently
by peroxide of hydrogen. His natural
color was steel gray, and the fur at the
roots showed it unmistakably. The lady
was an actress, who was passing
through here on her way to New York,
and when she called for her pet I inci
dentally referred to the dyeing. She
laughed, and admitted at once that she
had colored the fur to match a favorite
costume, adding that she had been as
sured by a doctor that the process was
entirely harmless. As far as I could
see, the dog's health was not affected.
He certainly looked very odd, and I
must admit rather pretty. When the
blondine begins to wear off. however,
he will be a holy terror." â New Orleans

Doting Hearts Torn Asunder on
the Way to the Altar.
Lewis E. Bulkeley and Mollie fiordon Start Out to Get
Married -Relatives Interfere and They Co

yesterday morning to run down to

Interfered, and after considerable argu

promised and Instead of going to the altar
went to the -matinee.
Bulk* ami the girl who is so anxious
to be his bride are bofh under age. The
youth, like the maid, claims to be ( 19
years old. but A. R. Cotton, guardian
of >hft would-be groom, declares he has
known but seventeen short, sweet, sum
mers, and Miss Gordon's family makes
similar assertions in regard to her tender
years.
Age is the only equal ground on which
the couple meet. Religion and social
status divide them. Miss Gordon is a
Jewess: and her family desire her. to wed
s. man of the same faitjh as she professes.
Further than that they have no objections
to Bulkeley, who is heir to a vast fortune
and has the entree to swell circles, while
the girl who has captures him ha.= a
humble little home at 654 Minna street
arid earns ?4 â¢ a week In a suspender
factory.
The family of Miss Gordon were- consid
erably disturbed when they discovered
yesterday morning that the young lady
had gone off to set married. Miss I^na
Gordon, Bister of t.he would-be bride,
rushed downtown to find her sister and
met her on Sutler street, near Montgom
ery, where she was awaiting the youth
whose name she hoped shortly to bear.
The sisters had a. spirited argument and
by the time, the -would-be benedict ap
peared on' the scene the police had been
called in to interfere.
Bulkeley proved much more tractable
â than the girl he hoped to make his bride
and at his suggestion the parties re
paired to the Gordon home, where an
amicable discussion ensued. Bulkeley
promised to patiently wait for the hand
of the fair Mollie until he was legally ca
pable of claiming her for his own and then
to show there was no ill feeling craved
permission to escort the young lady to the
theater.
The young lovers spent the afternoon at
the Columbia and amused themselves be
tween acts reading the startling tale of
their morning's escapade in the evening
papers. After the play Bulkeley returned
the girl to 1 .-â¢ Minna-street home and
spent some time in getting acquainted
with her family.

Bulkeloy's frankness is only surpassed
by i;-. modesty. When questioned as to

indulgent smile and in a most off-hand
manner said: "No. I'm not rich. I've
only got about half a million. Just at
present I have between $300 and $400 a

A REMARKABLE FEAT
OF CIVIL ENGINEERING
Valley Boad Officials Congratulate
Themselves on the Work Done
on Franklin Tunnel.
The Valley Road officials are congrat
ulating themselves on the success tha.t
has attended the work In connection with
the Franklin tunnel between Stockton
and Martinez.
Not only has it? 5600 feet of length hÂ«<=n
put through without a hitch and in a
length of Time much shorter than the pe
riod called for in the contract, but such
ha? been the accuracy in directing the
digging of the bis hole that, it may bÂ»
said that the two ends, when they came.
together, met directly "head on."
Engineâ rÂ« will have some idea, of the ex
cellence of the work when it is known
that the deviation in the whole length of
5600 feet proved to be only .016 in line, and
P36 in level. This means that the two ends
came together with only the difference
of a bare two inches on the line and twice
that distance on the level.

A WET BLANKET FOR
BACK NUMBER BOSSES
Republicans Condemn the Kelly=
Crimmins Scheme.
Election Commissioners Are of the Opinion That the
Apportionment Conflicts With Provisions of
the Primary Election Law.
IN every precinct of the city the
people condemn the plan of appor
tionment proposed by Crimmins
I and Kelly for the Republican
County Committee! The Election
Commissioners yesterday glanced at
the unwieldy blanket, and by common
consent resolved to reject it unless the
law clearly required its acceptance.
The board will probably render a de
cision in the matter to-morrow.
The local bosses. Crimmins and Kelly,
are trying to convince gullible Republi
cans that Dan Burns is opposed to the
blanket plan. It is a matter of utter
indifference to the people of fan Fran
cisco whether Burns is for or against
the plan. Outside of several men ap
pointed to office by Gage the Mexican
has no following. If he should put out
a Burns ticket he could not rally a
hundred electors to its support.
The. public, does not forget that Crim
mins and Kelly throughout the session
of the Legislature were ever ready to
do the political work of Burns. It is
true that Gage turned down Crimmins
and Kelly on the Board of Health ap
pointments, but their "turn down" was
in a contest for the spoils after the
election. Bosses may fight one another
for a division of patronage after the
election, but before the battle at the
polls they usually band together. In
the approaching political campaign
IT OTHERWISE.
Burns will be where the railroad places
bim. If the Southern Par i tic managers i
tell him to get In with Crlmmins and i
Kelly hf -wiM obey orders. The Call is
in possession of information which
points directly to the conclusion that
the railroad forces are reaching out for
the control of the Democratic, machine.
Burns may show a hand, but it will b"
a hand raised to defeat the Republican
party in the local campaign.
Everything in the political situation
indicates thai the coming year â¢will be
ji bad one for bossism. There is likely
to be an uprising of The people so earn
est and formidable that bosses and po
litical demagogues will be swept ont

The 1 Republican party is capable of
giving to the people of San Francisco
the best administration of municipal
affairs t-r-'r recorded. The essential
point now at issue is to wrest the party
reins from the hands of ignorant
bosses. Under the primary law some
committee must speak for each politi
cal organization that files a ticket. The.
Republican County Committee was ex
pected to speak for the great mass of
enlightened citizens comprising the
party, but the political doits went to
Phil Crimmins' saloon for wisdom and
inspiration and came out with the no
tion that the people could he fooled into
voting for 306 delegates put up by a
pair of back number bosses. As a boss
Phil Crimmins is little better than a
campaign memory, and Martin Kelly
belongs to the era of the Volunteer Fire
Department.
Republicans of the city perceive the
importance of the first administration
under the new charter, and are now
preparing to elect the delegates who
will comprise the municipal nominat
ing convention. If Crimmins, Kelly and
the County Committee get in the ; way
of the Republican advance they will
be cast aside as obstacles in the march
of reform.
Irving M. Pcott is apprehensive that
various conflicting interests will keep
thf Republican party divided, in reply
to a letter mentioning' him as a possible
'â¢andidrite for Mayor he writes from
New York to the Post of this city:
"There does not seem to hp any sup
port either by the people or press of San
Francisco regarding right principles for
th*Â» good of the whole cityâ only legis
lation suitine individual interests."
The Democratic plan of appointment
filed by the Committee of On^ Hun
dred. Jasper McDonald, chairman, is
under the provisions of section 1370 of
the Primary Election Law. The sec.
tion allows a combination of election
precincts. Tho combinations arranged
by the committee arc numbered from
one to fifteen inclusive. The lowest
number t>t deleÂ£ratr>s accorded to any
combination i-* that, given to number
is. vrherein ten delegates may be rho?

twenty-nine, is accredited to combina
tion No. 0. which embraces primary
election precincts, 46, 47, 4S, 4!>, 60, 51,
52 and 53.
The basis of apportionment Is one
delegate for each 60 votes oast at. the
last general election in each of the com
binations and one additional delegate
for a remainder of SO votes or over.
The convention will consist of 354 dele

Jacob Steppacher. Registrar of Vot

Curry, Secretary of State, that five po
litical parties wiH apply for places on

BLANKET BALLOT DOOMED
Election Commissioners Are
Opposed to the Scheme.
There was an Interesting coterie of poli

Klfction Commissioners yesterday morn

City and County Attorney Lane presided.
Commissioners Wells. Sheehan and Tilton

granted Registrar Steppacher ten addi

lican County Committee was read, ask

setting forth the Kelly-Crimmins scheme
of a. blanket ballot. The petition was
ordered placed on file and Attorney A.
Barnard, who appeared in behalf of the
committee, asked that immediate action
on it be taken. He urged that the time
was short in which to prepare the ballot,
and. the people he represented were anx
ious to have the commission pass upon
the legality of the plan at once.
Commissioners Wells and Elieenan were
not at all anxious to take, the matter up.
and Chairman Lane said that as all the
political parties had not tiled their peti
tions yet. and they had until 5 p. m. in
which to do so. it would be manifestly
Improper to take any action at that time.
He said the matter would be considered
soon, possibly at the meeting of the com
mission next Monday night, but it could
not be definitely decided then.
P. H. Prendergast. secretary of the
County Committee, insisted that a time
be set. He said that Commissioner I^ane
had been quoted as saying that the pro
poped blanket ballot was illegal, and if
the others held to that view the sooner

the County Committee, knew it the better.
The other" commissioners were content to
let Lane, do the talking, and that senile
man again declined to fix a time for the
hearing. He said the Republican party
was well represented in the Election Com
mission arid its interests would be well,
taken care of. â¢ , v.Â«j
Messrs. rrendergast and Barnard had
to be content with the assurance that
their petition would be considered Mon
day night, if time permitted, and the peti
tion of the Citizens' Republican party/
asking for a place on the ballot, was react
and filed. Soon after the Commissioners
adjourned the petition of the. Democratic
County Committee was handed to th->
Registrar. The petition relates that the.
local convention to be held by the Demo
cratic party shall consist of 364 delegates
apportioned among the .eighteen Assem
bly districts on the basis of one delegate
for each sixty votes cast at the last gen
eral election and one additional delegate
for a remainder of thirty votes or over.
After adjournment Commissioners bhee
han and Wells both declared themselves
as strongly opposed to the blanket ballot
scheme. . , ,
" "I have talked with many of the lead
ing Republicans of the city." said Mr.
Sheehan. "and they are all opposed to this
scheme. If it is adopted it will split th*
party wide open, but I don't see how it
can be adopted, for it is certainly illegal.
Commissioner Wells was equally as
outspoken in his opinion that the blanket
billot would not he adopted because of
its unpopularity as well as its illegality.
Commissioner Tilton said he had given
the matter no consideration, but he would
be guided by City and County Attorney
Lane's opinion.
"If he decides that it is illegal, and I
understand he has already expressed that
opinion. I certainly shall not vote for it."
said Tilton.
The commission adjourned to Monday
night, hut before they departed from the
Registrar's office they held a whispered
consultation and agreed to hold an ex
ecutive conference in City and County At
torney Lane's office some time during
Monday, when they will consider what
course to pursue in regard to the blajiket
ballot. â¢ v-
" A] Raisch, the chairman of the County
Committee, was one of those who were
in attendance at yesterday's meeting and
after the adjournment lip sought to up
hold the blanket ballot. in a discussion
with Registrar Steppacher and others.
The primary election law was read to
him and he was subjected to considerable
good natured raflery. Finally the chair
man blurted out:
"Well. I was in favor of the Assembly
district.plan froni the first, but the others
wanted this blanket ballot, so I gave in."

KIPLING'S COMPLAINT.
Says American Publishers Have Made
Him Responsible for a Fake.
. LONDON, July The Author has pub
lished a letter from Rudyard Kipling
which ends by setting forth explicitly the
grounds on which his case against certain
American publishers rests. He says:
"They have made me responsible, before
a public to whom I do peculiarly owe the
best and most honest work I can turn out.
for an egregrious padded fake, and all
these things th^y did taking advantage of
that public interest in my illness when I
lay at the point of death. I do not see
how I can permit their action to pass
without challenge. It establishes too many
precedents which will do evil to the honor
and integrity of the profession that so far
has given me countenance and profit."

DO YOU ON THE BREAKING UP OF CHINA

at Her Feet.
LORD CHARLES BERESFORD has issued his recent survey of
China under the title of "The Break-Up of China." Ho Vow,
who ranks next to Wu Tung Fang, Imperial Embassador at Wash
ing-ton, takes exception to Lord Beresford's statements and has
some startling ideas of his own relative to the question.
Coming from such high authority and one so well posted up
on the diplomatic relations of his country as Mr. Ho Vow. the pos
itive opinions expressed should certainly carry great weight, a"nd
are particularly interesting- upon the eve of an apparently great
crisis in the affairs of the Chinese empire.
Ho Vow has also something to say of the Chinaman as set
forth in Bret Harte's "Heathen Chinee." Besides, he enters into
the subject of future trade relations between the Celestial king
dom and the United States â a matter of the utmost importance to
San Francisco^
r Z^f TALI., wiry man of about 35
f years of age, with an oliv< m
r~~ pWion and the dear, sharp-cut
>â¢ features of the Chinese upper
*â  class, wearing tlir> conventional
qt;eue and a very unconventional,
stubby mustache of ebdity black, at
tired in a drab garment of finely t-x
--fabvic, insignia of his office, this
gentleman sat before me >n a room of
the Imperial Chinese Embassy on
Stockton street and save his opinions
â¢ of Lord Charles Beres
ford's recent survey of China, which are
embodied in his book just issued, called
"The Break-up of China."
Mr. Vow is the next highest imperial
official in ihÂ° United States to the Chi
nese Minister or Embassador at Wash
ington, Mr. Wu Tuna- Fang. Mr. Fang
is, however, the head representative ol
th< Chinese Government for' three na
. thÂ» United S1 Spain and
ntries which might form a
triangle in their geographical locations.
and which would seem to be about as
veniently segregated and situated
for the supervision of one man as any
â¢i the globe of equal area
II be. Still Mr. Fang rules
[fe in the three nations and
Mr. I'ow Is h I in command.
Mr. Vow is a brother-in-law of Mr.
Fang, the latter having married his sis
ter. The family is highly connected in
official circles in China, a brother of
Mr. You at present being a memlv-r of
the â  Legislature and others
holdir.-- if distinction.
Mr. Tow was formerly foreign sec
retary of the legation in "Washington
and was educated in England. He la
widely verged in diplomatic affairs,
Fpeaks the Knglish language as fluently
as one to the manner born, and not
only has keen, practical views upon the
relations of the two countries as re
gards commerce, but is profound both
in political economy and diplomacy.
Mr. Tow is not alone at the embassy,
however, for it is the residence also of
Mr. Shouting 1 , Consul for California,
nnd Messrs. Wong, Chan, Moore, Wang,
Wan and Lao, "wh<> are secretaries Rnd
attaches of the legation. Mr. Shouting
was formerly a member of the Chinese
diplomatic corps at Washington and
has had long experience in foreign offl.
cial life.
Mr. Tow has resided in San Fran
cisco three years. His family is in
China, but will shortly Join him here.
While in Washing-ton Mrs. Tow was
one of the most esteemed ladies in of
ficial society and was foremost at most
of its functions. The paucity of sala
â f Chinese officials, of which Lord
Beresford complains as being the chief
cause of the unsatisfactory condition
of imperial finances, does not obtain in
the diplomatic department. The salary
<;f the Consul General to the United
States is 55000 a year besttles fees.
These latter come not only through of
ficiating in matters of trade, but in
conducting inquests of arbitration
among Chinese subjects. There is no
consular court here, such as is held by
European and American Consuls in
various paj;s of Asia, for the Chinese
are accessible to the courts of the
United States as aliens, but the Juris
diction of these latter cannot extend
outside the limits of the United States.
The effect of the decrees of Mr. Tow
operate over the person and property
of th^ contestants in China, although
as such they do not bind him in the
United States, except as a result of ar-'
bitrament and award in the usual form.
Of social life at the embassy there is

After the arrival of Mrs. Tow, how
ever, this may be considerably changed.
It was formerly the custom for the for
eign representatives in San Francisco
to give a series of dinners to each other
during the year, but for some inex
plicable reason this fashion has fallen
into abeyance. Now the Chinese Con
sul General, instead of having a din
ner, gives a reception on Chinese New
Year, which occurs in February. To
this all foreign representatives and
their families are invited, as well as
the ri\ii and military functionaries of
the city.

What is it going to break up into? The
Chinese empire contains a population
of four hundred millions of people.
They are a race strong in traditions,
exceedingly set in th>-ir Ways, who have
a most Idolatrous esteem for their own
Government and its forms, and who

upon them of ai government by

BAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, JULY 9, 1899.
the Job of administering a government
of four hundred millions of people, who
may be as turbulent as any other peo
ple when occasion arises, is not a thing
to be sought after; especially is it not
an aspiration by European nations,
who may at any time have all they can
do at home. The situation is adequately
presented in the reply recently made in
the House of Cdmmons of England by
the Under Secretary to Lord Beresford,
who criticized the Government's atti
tude upon the Tangtse River. The
secretary said: "England has interests
in China, but It has a thousand times
greater interests in Europe and it must
look to these first.' This is the real
status of every nation of Europe who
is in the East to-day; the only trouble
with some of them is that they don't
know it.
"You must know," continued Mr.
Tow, "that very recently a great
change has come over the face of things
In the Orient. ThÂ» Chinese people are
waking up. They have been in a slum
ber of centuries, but they find that
they have now got to face new condi
tions which have been thrust upon
them by the enlightenment of the
Western world. Japan was prompt to
see this, and she has applied Western
benefits to herself. She utilized these
in the late war. Tt is a hard way for
BClence and knowledge to be injected
into a nation, but it is nevertheless
effective; you have heard of great fires
building cities; and marvelous bene
fits may be acquired to the defeated
nation from the most disastrous of
wars.
"The Chinese need to be taught. They
are hungering now for a knowledge of
western ways. They want western ma
chinery, appliances, methods. No coun
try can furnish these in such a degree
as the United States. Your Invention
and engineering is in advance of those
of any other nation. The country to
conquer China â or rather I should say
convert Chinaâ is not Russia, in many
respects nearly as dark as itself, but
the United States, with all its marvels
of mechanics and its ingenuity in turn
ing the forces of nature to the uses of
man. In such a conquest China ex
tends the welcome hand, for it is one
which would raise our people to a
higher plane, which would lift up the
individual as well as the nation, for
as a chain is no stronger than its
weakest Unk, so it ought to be an
axiom of administrative science that a
government is never superior to the
welfare of its humblest subject. The
exaltation of the Chinese must be ef
fected, and this must be done through
the practical avenues of his material
advancement. The Chinese are quiet,
intelligent and exceedingly industrious.
Honesty with them is a kind of reli
gion. Bret Harte misrepresented us
hugely in the 'Heathen Chinee." I am
sorry to have to believe that the euchre
trickster of Poker Flat, who had
On the ends of his fingers, which tapered,*,
What is frequent in tapersâ that's wax.
nas erected in the American mind an
ideal of Chinese character. There are
tricksters among us, to be sure, but the
Chinese as a people are honest. Joe
Ooetz, a German-American, who owns
this building, owns also about half of
Chinatown. He lends a great deal of
money to the Chinese merchants. I
understand he has now about $600,
--000 loaned out among them. I will war
rant that for not a dollar he has
loaned to Chinese has he a scrap of pa
per to show. He does not require it;
it is not customary among Chinese to
give such. A Chinese asks Air. Goetz
for a loan of -$1000; he wants it at 9
per cent for six months. All right; he
gets it. That is the end of that part
of the transaction. At the end of the
six months the merchant goes to him
and gives him his money and interest.
Among the Chinese the word of a bor
rower is his bond. Ido not believe that
Mr. Goetz deals with other nationali
ties in the same manner.
"This leads me to say that a vast op
portunity now lies open to the Ameri
ca tip in the Orient. You are most ag
gressive people for trade when you once
get started. If you would pursue the
methods of trade getting among the
Chinese in China that you employ
among yourselves, the country would
be at your feet in a few years. We are
not a poor nation; w-e have among us
the accumulated wealth of thousands of
years of continuous nationality. We
have gold to buy and we have domin
ion over a region of the earth's surface
inferior to no like scope in undeveloped
resources. The greatest opportunity
which exists on the globe to-day for a
vast aggregate of people is open to the
Americans in China. Now is the time;
heretofore the minds of our people were
not prepared to receive you; now they
are. I remember only very recently
that a half-dnzen American business
men went to China on a pleasure trip.
They had, no notion of doing business,
but they had. entree into the higher and
official element of the country and
managed to get acquainted with some
of our merchants. When they returned
to the United States they had contracts
aggregating over $5,000,000.
"And, indeed," continued Mr. Tow, "I
am gratified to observe that the Ameri
cans are turning their attention to
China. Through my brother-in-law,
Minister Fang, Mr. Rockefeller hastak
en a concession for a thousand miles of
railway from Canton to Hankow,
through one of the most populous and
cultivated districts of China, and this
will shortly be undergoing construction.
Besides this road there are 2577 miles of
road projected, for which contracts
have been signed, and nearly 2000 miles
of other lines are actually being built,
making in all nearly 6000 miles of new
railroads, which are either building or
contracted to be built, and which will
be in operation within a few years.
This will give you 6ome idea of how
China is waking up, and of the business
there is there for Americans if they will
only go after It.
"China needs thousands of things you
have here to sell. She needs your flour,
your sugar, petroleum, your metals,
implements. glassware and infinite
else. In only one town in China, Hong
kong, Is there a water works; there are
no electric light plants, no telephones
or telegraphs, street railway lines or
factories.
"With all of these advantages offered
Americans in China," continued Mr.
Tow, "we feel that the peoples of the
two nations should be brought closer
together. My brother-in-law has
sought through an eminent Congress
man to secure some modification of the
exclusion act. The United States have
been grossly misled upon the exclusion
of Chinese and they are now pursuing
a wrong policy. You are driving Chi
nese emigrants into Mexico, where
there are no exclupion laws, who would
otherwise come here and help develop
your country- It is a fallacy to be
lieve that a Chinese will work cheaper
than any one else. You cannot get a
Chinese cook to-day in California for
the same money that you can get one
of a European nation. You can see
that the rheap labor fallacy is now ex
ploded. You have no restrictions to
the introduction of Japanese laborers,
except that they come upon contract,
and this obtains as we3l against Eu
rope as apainst Asia. If this law had
been at all times in existence there
never would have been a Chinese ques
tion on this coast, for the cause of it
was the importation of coolies to build
the Union Pacific 1 Railroad. They came
in too Large numbers to become di
gested by the country and to compre
hend their environment. Still there
never was at any time over 100,000 Chi
nese on this coast; there are now about
50.000.
"As I have remarked, you do not have
any restriction upon Japanese immi
gration, and when we ask the cause of
this obvious discrimination we are told
that there are only fifty millions of
Japanese and that only a small per
centage of them can come at all events,
but of the Chinese there are hundreds
of millions and if the gates were not
closed against them the country would
become inundated with their popula
tion. This is entirely erroneous. It is
not commonly known that the Chinese
in the United States are all from the
Kwang Tung pn-vince in the south of
China. They are Cantonese. In this
district there are not more people than
there are in Japan. The Chinese from
elsewhere would not come here. They
could not speak the dialect of the Tungs
nor get along with them and they
would not come. Nor would the Tungs
themselves come in large numbers.
For people to move in armies they must
be marshaled in armies. An agent stir
ring up people to go to a remote region
and accept employment for a definite
Increase of their existing wages may
moVe a vast number; but if they are
left to be influenced only by the gener
ally superior advantages of a country
for residence and occupation, such will
act alone upon the individual and not
upon the assemblage; and you will get
only an emigrant here and there.
"With more Chinese In the United
States the trade of the United States
with China would be greater. Chinese
now here, largely engage in production
and shipment to China. Industry in
these lines would Increase proportion
ately with the increase of Chinese pop
ulation. Trade as it at present exists
with China is on the increase, but you
buy vastly more than you sell us. In
L 897, for instance, you imported from
China on this coast $10,450.0<V) worth
of goods and sent us only $3,556,000 of
goods, the larger part of which was
flour. This condition could easily be
reversed. Your treaty with us, how
ever, needs revision, not alone in its
exclusion clauses, but in other respects,
particularly in the matter of the opium
v trade. Under its existing provisions
neither a Chinese nor an American can
engage in importing opium. Last year
there was a cargo of this product which
came to San Francisco upon which the
duty alone was $150,600. The profits on
that shipment and upon all such ship
ments could not go to Americans. Why
do you elect to deny yourselves the
benefit and throw it into the hands of
Europeans?
"Upon the whole, I wish to say," con
tinued Mr. Vow, "that there has never
been a time In the nistory of the two
nations that all the conditions seem to
favor such close amity as the present.
Our arising development, the existence
of the open-door status of China, the
awakening demands of our government
and our people in the lines of progress,
your genius, enterprise and power In
material fields, from all this va.st re
sults must be achieved. An immense
amount of benefit irPgetting Americans
to understand China has been effected
by Mr. Fang. He is himself thoroughly
in touch with American life and is un
doubtedly the most valuable man for
this mission whom China possesses.
His term expires next year, but he will
in all probability be reappolnted, as the
existing administration in China is
looking first to the capacities and pecu
liar fitnesses of men for prescribed work
and to their personalities and connec
tions afterward. A few years of
drawing the lines closer between the
United States and China, such as has
been done through the activities of Mr.
Fang, will place the reciprocal interests
of the two nations on a far different
footing from what they are to-day."
In conclusion Mr. Vow stated that
he was. with trre purpose of Introducing
American goods into China on some
thing of a complete scale, arranging a
plan to this end. The difficulty In intro
ducing American goods to China has al
ways been that Americans do not know
how to go about It, as the Chinese are
very deliberate and great sticklers on
form. To present American interests
to Chinese, therefore, is Mr. Vow's aim,
and he is thoroughly familiar with the
methods to be pursued in doing this.
Being widely known in China and mov
ing upon a high plane of citizenship
and society, this can be more readily
and perfectly accomplished. The de
tails of tjje undertaking have not yet
been announced, but they will transpire
through diplomatic channels.18

FOR THE
RING.
Â£^=rp T the present time the various
If V\ methods of training are ques-
Ji j\ tions thai are being widely dis
-11 0\ cussed by all who are interested
H v* iti pugilistic affairs. The result
of the Jeffries-Fitzsimmons fight would
seem to warrant the belief that his
method of preparing for a contest was a
wrong one; but Lanky Bob will not listen
to any such suggestions. lli j has his own
explanations to account for his defeat and
his training system does not appear as
one of them. In fact the training ques
tion is one over Which expert opinion dif
fers is greatly as upon almost any con-
ceivable subject.
Charlie White, who has handled many
pugilists in his time, says that Corbett
needed more training than any man he
ever knew. At the same time he is erf
the opinion that the ex-champion over
did the matter. He insisted upon taking
long runs, he made his boxing bouts as
long as possible and discontinued them
only to commence a long seance with the
bag. He wrestled, he ran any distance
without tiring, and yet. after all. he did ,
not have sufficient vital force to enable
him to stand up before Fltzsimmons.
fiharkey, on the other hand, does no
such stunts. He has often said that he
did not think a whole lot of training nec
essary. "I'm usually willing to flght, " he
said, "and I don't find much trouble In

The discovery of the diggings at Cape
Nome seems to have been quite by aecl
d.-nt. Three men in a small sail boat
were blown in there by stress of weather
and thought while there they mii?ht as
well look around. They did so. and struck
what appears now to be the best
pect on the American side. Cape Nome
is situate-.: on Norton Sound, 230 miles

Jeffries does not believe In partaking
of any alcoholic liquors while training,
and, like Sharkey, he enjoys his exercise
bo greatly that his period of preparation
for a tifcht is more like play than work.
His exercise, however, is oftenvof the
most violent order. After a long and
very fast run, ending in a sprint of 800
or 600 yards, he skips the rope before
taking his, bath, rub down and massage

from that of other pugilists.

Tommy Ryan, punched the bag. exercised
with the medicine ball and the wrist ma
chine, ran, played handball, rowed on the
lake, enjoyed long spins on his bicycle and
put in his days in ;i manner highly pleas

to hit him hard, and he used no force in

had displayed more judgment the rank

the supposition would naturally have
arisen that some flatterer was seeking op

claim about mi' twenty-fourth or' Stuart
bio. .(i and then thai is a very liberal al
lowance. Bui in San Francisco and the
State generally we have any number of
persons gayly claiming to be of the rural
house of Stuart. It is true that a man

â¢ clan Stuart was a small clan, and in its

Scottish families are most tenacious
over their rights to family. There is

"llout mon, the Queen must be a proud

MARY LINCOLN DISCUSSES SAVORY
COLD MEATS FOR SUMMER USE.
SOME form of cold meat is particu
larly acceptable daring this month,
and we soon tire of cold boiled ham,
tongue and corned beef, while the
i second serving of roast lamb and veal
; becomes monotonous if they appear too
! frequently. Such meats lack the delicious
i' flavor which is imparted by having va
riety of seasoning materials cooked with
the "meat. The following methods of pre
paring veal will be acceptable both for
cold dinners or luncheons at home, or for
picnics and camping parties:
JELLIED VEAL.
Select a knuckle of veal or any bony
piece that has a large proportion of gela
tine. Wipe, cut in small pieces and re
move carefully any small fragments of
bone They can be seen and felt now
easier than later on in the process. Cover
with cold water, boil quickly, remove the
I scum, then n<ld one onion, one teaspoon
ful of salt and one teaspoonful of pepper.
Let it simmerâ not boil hardâ till the meat
slips from the bones, the. gristly portions
are dissolved and the liqnor reduced to
one cupful. Remove the meat, pick out
all the bones, strain the liquor and sea
son lightly with salt, lemon juice and pap
rika and "very slightly with thyme, if you
prefer Chop or pick the meat apart, add
three tablespoonfuls of powdered cracker
and enough of the meal liquor to make
it very moist. Mix thoroughly, taste and
add more seasoning if needed, and pack
beer and cheese," Is his very succinct
receipt.
Mr. Miller Is keeping house in a
snug little flat on Van Ness avenue.
Mr. Fedris, his manager, is allowed to
enjoy with the star the delights of
home life. Fedris, who is an unusually
stalwart and handsome chap, thinks
equally as well of Miller as a house
keeper as an actor.
"It is not only the 'rarebit,' " said
Fedris, "it is the chops. A trifle smoky
when he gets through with them, but be
eats them and I know he relishes them."
In the Miller flat, however, there is
other cooking than that which is done
by the star. A chef with a worldwide
reputation for several tempting "petit
plats" rules the range.
"Jules," said his master when he went
through the trying ordeal of engaging
him, "I know you fellows always want
the lime light to follow you about and
insist that the spot that marks the cen
ter of the kitchen be sacred to your
gifted personality only. That will be
all ris;htâ when I'm not around. But
when the goddess of the cuisine calls
and you see me coming with the cheese
â you will exit r. v. 1."
Jules knew he was face to face with
the truth in art, and bowed in humble
acquiescence.
The little flat that is to be the
Miller home for the next ten weeks has
already taken on many features indica
tive of the personality of the master.
It is spick and span and neat.
The furniture is substantial and ar
tistic.
There is no superfluous bric-a-brac.
Books are everywhere. The latest
publication, the last celebrated novsl,
historical works and books of refer
ence, are scattered throughout tha
house.
Although order is the watchword of
the home, there is an artistic disar
rangement of things that shows the
house is lived inâ that shows the books
are road and the luxuries enjoyed.
It is the home of an artist and the
artistic atmosphere is round it every
w here.
Miss Anglin. the fascinating leading
lady of the company, declares she keeps
house because nature never intended
her for a housekeeper and she loves a
cup of tea, boiling hot tea, when she
returns from rehearsal.
The clever leading lady, of all the
housekeeping qualities possesses only
the very worthy one of appreciation.
She couldn't boil an egg properly if
her life depended upon it, and is fright
ened at the very thought of attempting
to make a cup of coffee. Miss Anglin
i.rou.eht her maid with her from New
York, and with that worthy person's
ussistanee took possession of her
home before she had secured the ser
vices of the necessary servants. When
there is rehearsal to attend daily very
little time remains for household dutieÃ
and so the securing of domestics had
to be necessarily postponed for several
days.
"In a way it was quite awful," said
Miss Anglin. "Lena, my maid, cooks
after a fashion, but then I patronized
regularly the candy stores and had
plenty of ice cream soda and that sort
to cut my appetite and I was not so
tremendously hungry."
Miss Anglin's home is a "love." Ev
erything about it proclaims the ease
and luxury the fascinating mistress
adores. A dear little garden with a
miniature lawn and a wild confusion
of mignonette and sweet peas steps
right off from the dining-room. It is
here the lair lady of the house sips
There are other resemblances which
have called forth exclamations of sur

VEAL LOAF.
"Wipe and remove the skin and tough
membrane from two pounds lean veal.
Put it in boiling salted water and sim
mer one hour. Remove and -drain, then
chop it fine: -chop also one-fourth pound
of rat salt pork, or one-eighth pound of
bacon. Add four rolled butter crackers,
one teaspoon salt, one-fourth teaspoon
pepper, one-eighth teaspoon nutmeg or
mace, one teaspoon minced parsley, four
tablespoons melted butter, and two well
beaten eggs. Make it quite moist with
the liquor in which the veal was boiled
and mix it thoroughly. Add more salt if
needed, the amount depending upon the
pork or bacon. Pack it Into a brick loaf
pan and bake it slowly three hours, or
pack it in a mold and steam it for three
hours. Serve hot with a border of hot

One slice of veal from the leg cut half

in small pieces. Lay the meat on a hard
wood board, scatter the fat over it and
pound It out very thin, lapping it over
where broken and pound the fat into the
meat. Keep the meat in rectangular
shape with the edges even. Cover the
moat with a thin layer of finely shaved
her afternoon tea and masters intri
cate roles.
If MJsa Anglin does not cook she en
joys the process of cooking. One of
her greatest delights is to wan<ler into
the kitchen, hover round the range and
with infantile curiosity raise iho cov
ers of the pots and kettles and to ask
the cook all sorts of bewildering ques
tions.
When she is tired of the mysteries of
the cuisine she strolls into the dining
room and fingers lovingly the dainty
faience that is her delight and pride.
Miss Anglin's tastes are simple. A!
plain little dinner well cooked, daintily
served, and ice cream is all she de
mands.
In her cozy little sitting-room Miss
Anglin surrounds herself with the
things she loves. The pictures of
mother, brothers, sister and father are
where she can always see them.
"They say I look like father," she
says, and her eyes shine with a pride
that even the tears that dim them when
she looks upon that poor lost brother's
face cannot efface.
Miss Anglin has no desire to master
the intricacies of housekeeping. She
is too engrossed with her art to think
of anything else. Her tastes and her
habits are simple; "Most people get a
totally wrong idea of our life," she ex
plained. "After the theater we are
supposed to indulge in the most out
rageous extravagances. My wildest
dissipation so far has been a car ride.
The other night after the performance
Mr. Miller and I got on a car, rode to
the terminus and camÂ© back without
even alighting. I don't know what car
it was or where we ment. I only know
we enjoyed the ride."
In spite of Mr. Miller's ajid Miss
Anglin's success in Vhe housekeeping
line the palm for housekeeping qualifi
cations must go to Guy Standing.
Standing is a yachtsman, and that ex
plains everything.
Standing keeps house with James
Lindsay and Earle Brown; that is,
Standing attends to the household and
the other fellows enjoy the fruits of
his labors.
"I am a yachtsman," said Standing,
"and I have been married seven years.
Those are my credentials as a house
keeper. I not only know how things
ought to be done, but I know how to
do them."
In the Standing flat everything shines
and has that peculiarly orderly look of
things nautical. There is nothing
bachelorllke about the house. It really
looks as though some thorough "haus
frau" presided over its destinies. The
walls are hung with excellent paint
ings and water-color sketches, all by
the man who amuses the world in the
theater at night and makes the coffee
in the morning.
Nature has been more than kind to
Standing. She has loaded him down
with unusual gifts as an artist, she has
given him a magnificent voice, made
him a more than fairly good actor, en
dowed him with housekeeping quali
ties and let him be the owner of a most
wonderful bull terrier.
And, most of all, Standing loves his
bulldog, who rejoices in the romantic
name of Hugo Belsamo. Music and act
ing, painting and housekeeping are all
well enough in their way, but they
don't weigh much with Standing in
comparison with Hugo. Just at present
the man who runs the best-regulated
flat of all the Miller Company house
keepers has one deep regret â he got to
San Francisco too late to show Hugo
at the dog show.

Y+-S -hoi by the favor of the sods.
* has been bestowed all those
blessings the possession of which gives
one the right tcr active membership In
the aristocratic and exclusive club
which we call society.
That right he has exercised In the
past and his wife and childrenâ fam
ily of whom any man ought to be
proudâ are exercising it still. Between
himself and them, however, as between
himself and the rest of his fellow crea
tures, a wall has been built by his own
hands; a wall that, during his lifetime,
with his consent, shall never be leveled
nor surmounted.
He has brains, education, good line
age, good health and wealth. He has
had, besides these, friends, a happy
home, a loving wife, and beautiful chil
drenâenough to make this earth a par
adise for almost any man. And yet, he
lives, as he will doubtless die. alone in
a House of Shadows, which has for
years been his haven of refuge from
the world.
It was a fine house once, this house
In which a man has chosen to bury him
self aliveâ it would be a fine house still
were it not that it has so utterly passed
under the dominion of neglect and de
cay. A large roomy mansion, square
fronted, with long windows pet deeply
in its massive walls and looking out
upon the street under frowning eye
brows of heavy masonry, it stands a
little back from the pavement with a
bit of lawn Interposed deprecatingly
between it and the world outside.
It is not a sociable looking place.
There is no hint of even latent hospi
tality in the aspect of the rusty Iron
gate and the knobless front door that
has never been known to be opened
during the past five years. The lawn is
a tangle of dried grass, sticks, pieces of
newspaper and all' manner of blow
about refuse of city streets. The door
is covered with successive coatings of
dust that the sticky fog has plastered
over the oaken panels; and the win
dowsâgazing blankly like the eyes of
some poor uncared-for dead creature
are shutttered on the outside by thick
blinds formed of the same fog and dust,
which shut away from the careless gaze

elegantly furnished throughout; but
you will also see that the furnishings
are of the fashion of past days, and
that neglect, utter and systematic, has
been its portion for many years.

woods and beautiful marbles, mirrors

t-yOLLOWS the true story of how
/Smith got the true story of how
got in with the Gaythornes
"1 and the Mullers, and all of those
golden folks up the State.
>k It was In Paris, in the quarter
called Latin, where, by the way, I
never met anybody* who knew any Latin.
It was only three days after Smith's first
arrival ami us that he went to Long
champs, all by himself, to see the races.
He tried to persuade one of us after an
other to go with him, but everybody had
some good reason for staying away, gen
era'ly a financial reason, and it ended in
Smith's going by hmiself. This he did in
a costume that no doubt seemed em
inently appropriate to the occasion.
It is important to note here that Smith
went to the Longchamps races dressed in
a light overcoat, a gray Derby hat, trous
ers of shepherd's plaid, the check thereof
drawn to a rather large scale, and that
he carried big field glasses slung about
him. as if a good view of the running was
r vital necessity of his business.
The make of his boots on that occasion
is also very Important They were bal
morals, with Stout porpoise leather lacea.
That same evening Smith appeared at
our studio, dressed in this name costume,
though not so fresh, of course, as when
he had set forth earlier in the day.
"How much did you win?" Pollard
asked him, entirely without salutation or
preface of any kind.
"Win? Don't talk to me about winning.
I'm scared to death." Smith said.
His eyes, when you got the light on
them, certainly did seem to be popping
out of his head.
"What scared you?" I asked.
He pulled out of his pocket a thing that
looked like a silk sack and flung it down
on Pollard's leather trunk.
"That's what scared me. Don t touch
it for God's sake." ]\
"Snakes'."' Pollard asked, between puffs
at his clay pipe. Pollard was English.
" "If it's a bomb," I said, "you ought to
have taken it to the police. We don't
want you bringing anything like that In
here, you know; and besides, you handle
the thing much too carelessly."
"Look here, fellows," said Smith, stand
ing by the mysterious bundle as jf he
were on guard, "this isn't any laughing
matter. Do 1 look like a thief?"
Pollard told him that In Europe thieves
didn't wear any distinctive uniform. "Of
course" he added, "one wouldn't like to

"You must have been drinking-. Smith."
said Pollard. "You haven't got on any

"No, but I had," he retorted. "It stuck
in th" lace of my shoe as I was walking
through the grass. I didn't notice it until
several sporty looking ducksâ two of them
.had given me a peculiar kind, of look.
Then I looked down to see what was
wrong, and the only thing I could see at
all out of the way. was this piece of
clover."
"Was that the most remarkable thing
you could find in all your get-up?" I
asked.
"Just you â wait," he said. "I didn't
think it anything at all remarkableâ didn't
even take the trouble to pick it out. And

had stared at me came along again, Just

he looked over his shoulder and said in

"Well. 1 didn't want to seem too green,

"Well, he didn't seem to pay any at

was a sort of a rally, and everybody be

and he shoved this thing into my hand

"And you took It, like a lamb?" I
asked.

growled. "1 wanted to be able to swear

Very we)l. We all agreed to examine it
as one man.

silk, which had evidently been very
dexterously snipped with a pair of sharp
ci Issors. [nslde was a neat leather r

with >i German stampâ unopened.
"Hurrah!" Smith shouted. "Don't open
th>- pocketboek, fellows. Here's the old
mans address: "Anthony J. Gaythorne,
Pension Libre, Rue Castiglione.' "
"That's important to remember." said
Pollard. "We shall have to be careful to
give the Pension Libre a wide berth, or
we may run Into Gaythorne. But now to
business."
Pollard pretended to be going to open
the pocketbook, but Smith, who was
lughly takfn in bi his pretense,
grabbed him violently, and It looked for a
minute or two as If there was going to
be a free fight in our studio. However, I
succeeded In restoring order and quiet.
"Pollard," I said, "since my countryman
insists on doing the honest net, I suppose
we must let him have his way, Just this
once. But mind. Smith, if you are going
to get into this push, you'll have to take
up with our ways, and divvy up fair and
honest whenever you make a haul."

Smith still denies it, that we had suc

bpoks and sharing the plunder in their
studios. Smith has always said that he
knew we were guying him all the time:
I only know that' he escaped from our
Btudio In a very precipitate fashion; Pol
lard and I fell all over the studio, laugh
ing as we heard the clatter of thope
laced-up shoes of his on the two flights of
stairs.
Moreover, as I have often pointed out
to Smith, If he had not made up his mind
that Pollard and I were persons of crimi
nal habits, why did he not introduce us
to his friend Gaythorne?
He found Gaythorne that very night,
and it turned out. very much to Smith's
satisfaction, that Gaythorne was an
Americanâ New Yorker. But from nil
I could hear. Smith's satisfaction was as
nothing to (iaythorne's when Smith pre
sented him with his inside pocket and the
letter. Gaythorne allowed Smith the lin
ing of his overcoat, which had evidently
been .treated with hasty surgery. Smith
told Gaythorne the whole story of his
Longchamps adventure. Then Gaythorne
âa lively, fellow of middle age â slapped
Smith on the back and called him a credit
to the nag. and insisted on making a big
fuss over htm. From which we inferred
that the contents of that pocketbook must
have been valuable.
But there was more behind, which we
did not infer, but got direct from Gay
thorne himself, when we ran into Smith
and him having a glorious time at an
open-air cafe a few days later. We sim
ply made ' Smith introduce us to his
friend. -;.-â¢-â¢
"Now," said Gaythorne. "I want you
boys to be good to me," This was in the
expensive humor that grew out of cham
pagne. "You've been uncommon good to
me already. Don't know where I'd have
been If It hadn't beet; for Smith here and

countable prejudices. She hates horse
races and she hates liquor. Now- If she
knew I'd stayed back in Paris to go to
those racesâ see? Eh?"
After thatâ months laterâ when the
Gaythornes and Mrs. Gaythorne's sister,
Mrs. MulUr. got back to Paris, they
looked up Smith, and ever since then they
have stood by him, and Gaythorne him
self has been as good as two business
agents for Smith. Which is the real rea

part of the State to sell any old daub he
wants to at a high figure.

REMOLDED ENEMY'S CANNON BALLS TO RETURN FIRE.
THROUGH the portals of a new

In history one of those martial
figures that, living In one cen
tury, appear to have been controlled by
the daring spirit of a former age. The
pimple headstone informs the Infre
quent visitor to the city of the dead
that beneath reposes the clay of Colonel
Alfred Swingle.
The story of Colonel Swingle's life
discounts the most thrilling romances
of a Mayne Held or an Aimard.
In any one chapter of his varied life
there is material sufficient to furnish
forth the most realistic melodrama. In
his short campaign in Nicaragua In 1857
with Walker the manner of the man is
probably better to be determined than
in any other period of his life. It
stamp*. l him as not only an intropld
and active leader, but as a man fertile
in resources, any or all of which he
brought into play as the circumstances
might rfuuire. At the siege of Rlvas
these qualities were notably exempli
fied. Walker and his men were penned
up in the town surrounded by Innumer
able foes pressing en every side. They
larked provisions and were alnv>3t out
of munition? of war.
Swingle was the great filibuster's
chief of artillery, and, as such, was in
direct chaise of the guns. These were
six -pounders, which he managed with
damaging effect until his supply of can
non balls gave out. Equal to the occaa
slon, he began immediately the manu
facture of substitutes, by making In the
sand holes of the proper size, filling
them with small scraps of iron and
pouring in melted lead. When they
cor.led he had serviceable shot until the
supply of lead and small bits of Iron
gave out. Then ho had to turn to again
and use his off-hand knowledge of
physics. He had enough to enable him
to build a crude furnace with a hot air
blast which enabled him to melt large
pieces of metal, with which he cast the
first iron cannon balls ever made In
Central America. When he ran out of
iron he transformed into round shot all
the old church bells he could find, and
used them as a convincing argument
against the enemy. Even this sort of
ried, and the cad old house learned to
emile now and then, and to be, if not
gay, at least contented looking again.
Old Mr. Keane â rather of a recluse
even when a pretty daughter-in-law
and merry grandchildren tried to make
the world happier for him â died sud
denly one day, and his death brought
the young doctor face to face with a
totally unexpected complication.
A woman, of whose very existence he
was unaware, appeared at the funeral
in the deepest of mourning, and later
put in a claim to half the large prop
erty left by the eider Keane, claiming
to have been for years supported by
him, and to be by contract his legal
wife.
The battle which folio-wed in the
courts was long and severe, and al
though it resulted in a complete vic
tory for the son, the notoriety which
it gave the family, and the manner in
which his private affairs became pub
lic property, made the triumph a dear
ons for him.
He felt disgraced and humiliated by
the whole affair, in -which he was, of
course, altogether blameless, and his
natural shyness deepened Into absolute
mlsanthrcrpy. By degrees he withdrew
not only from the companionship of his
fellow men but even from that of his
own family, and found his pleasure,
during his few leisure hours, in solitary
communion with himself and his mem
ories in the retirement of his own spe
cial apartments.
Later, an a pretext bo slight as to be
trivial, he gave up the practice of his
profession, and then his wife, fearing
what she scarcely dared, for the child
ren's sake, to acknowledge even to her
self, persuaded him to close the town
house, which had always seemed to
harbor within it brooding shadows of
unhappiness and unrest, and come with
her and the children to their country
place in San Rafael.
Willing to please her who had brought
into his life all of brightness that he
had ever known, the doctor for a brief
time tried to content himself among
the roses and sunshine of the pretty lit
tle town across the bay. One day, how
ever, the yearning for the old place
grew too strong to be resisted. He had
grown to hate the encircling hills that
seemed to make his beautiful country
home a prison; the sunlight and the
brilliant colors of the flowers which
blwmed all about him made his eyes
ach* with their insistent brightness; the
glad voices of his children, their music
and laughter and gray good comradeship
disturbed and fretted him beyond en
durance; his wife's assiduous and lov
ingly watchful care filled him with re
sentful distrust, and he longed for the
solitude, the gloom, the quiet and the
personal freedom which he knew would
be his in the "House of Shadows." And
so he came away from all that troubled
him and sought the quiet refuge of the
mansion which he so loved.
The heavy oaken doors swung back
on their creaking hinges and the dark
and silent house seemed to welcome
him as if he were a truant son returned
to his own. The doors closed behind
him, and, so closing, shut him away
forever from all that other men hold
dear.
From that day he has lived there
alone with the shadows. Going and
coming only when necessity drove him
to have commerce'*with th^ world out
side, and then through the back way
only, his presence among them was for
some time unknown to the good people
of the vicinity, and after a while it was
whispered about that there was some
thing weird and uncanny about the
place. There were noises to be heard
there at unusual hours, and dim lights
flitted from room to room sometimes
the whole night through.
N'nw and again, on moonlight nights,
passers-by caught glimpses of a white
robed figure gazing mournfully through
the curtains, or pacing up and down
with wild wavings of upraised arms â
a white shadow talking with the black
shadows that ever dogged its footsteps.
Again the strains of music floated out
on the air between the hours of mid
night and gray dawn; and one man,
more venturesome- than his brethren,
climbing to the drawing room windows
and peering in as best he could, saw a
dim white something clo-udlly visible in
the gloom enshrouded distance, and
straightway grew sick with fear and
went his way proclaiming awesomely â
religious argument gave out when no
more church bells were available, and
the facile artillerist was driven to his
last resort, to send out parties to scour
the purlieus of the besieged town for
the shot with which the enemy had
pelted him and to send them, red hot,
back to him.
Such were the odds against which
Swingle contended at Rivas, and such

when he found voice to speak at ail
that he had "seen a ghosf playing up
on the piano In the desterted house.
From these things a story grew until
even the neighbors began to look un
certainly upon the place, and supersti
tious and credulous strangers visited
the vicinity to stare and wonder and
wait for the happening of fearsome
things. What really occurred was but
a tiny seed from which sprang and
flourished a green bay tree of narration.
Ghost stories of all kinds were dragged
forth and parts of them attached more
or less deftly to the defenseless habi
tation.
At last, however, the truth became
known and then the street settled back
into quiet again. . The residents of that
part of San Francisco are neither med
dlesome nor ill-natured. They are re
spectable, steady going, eminently
practical people, and since their wealthy
neighbor does them no harm by his ec
centricities they see no reason why any
one should even attempt to prevent him
from living his life in his own way.
If he prefers, say they, to live alona
in his mansion instead of selling it or
renting it, and living with his family,
that is entirely the business of himself
and his family. If he prefers to always
enter and leave his abode by way of the
back alley, he can certainly do a? he
chooses in this regard. If he likes his
own society better than that of his fel
low-beings, he is quite welcome to it
for all they care. If he objects to the
use of broom and duster, and mop and
soap and water, within the borders of
the domain over which he â like an
urban Selkirkâ reigns with undisputed
Bway, he has a perfect right to let dust
and dirt and cobwebs accumulate.
If he wishes to promenade over his
own house in his flowing night-mbe,
with or without the accompaniment of
a candle, according to nature's benefi
cence in the way of illumination, that,
again, is his own affair. If he prefers
to play the piano or sing at night in
stoad of by day, the neighbors can af
ford to allow him to amuse hims-lf
occasionally without making unneigh
borly fuss abo-ut It.
He is "a good man" they say, but a
"little qu^er;" and so he lives alone and
unmolested in that desert of unpeopled
rooms. His feet wear threadbare paths
on the rich carpets: his fingers, grown
tremulous of late, touch lovingly the
yellow keys of the once fine piano and
draw from them sorrowful music of
other days.
The moths nest and hatch in the up
hotettered furniture and flit about like
insect ghosts in the stagnant atmos
phere of the unaired "rooms. Spiders
spin their web from corner to corner,
from mantel to bookcase, from balus
trade to doorpost, and dust â "the
bloom of time" â settles down from day
to day on web and curtain, carpet and
furniture, window and wall, thicker
and heavier, and rests there undis
turbed.
Some day or night the end will come.
The spirit that has so chafed at the re
strictions of mortality and circum
stance will be set free. The human life,
which for so many long years hag b">en
the one disturbing element in the silent
solitude of the dreary house, will be
snuffed out like the candle which has
lighted so many purposeless pilgrim
ages of the restless feet.
The white shadow will no longer aa
sert its claim against, and supremacy
over, its dark companions, but will join
with them on equal footing, and the
"House of Shadows" will, perhaps,
never realize that any change has
come, but will shelter and brood over
them all then as now.

Fighters Educate and
Care for Equine
Helpers.
THE Fire Department of San
Francisco, conceded as It is to be
among the finest in the world,
would be nothing without its
horses. Its capable chief and his
skillful assistants would be useless. Its
up-to-date apparatus might as well
rust In Its house?, 'lid not the swift
footed animals Jump a' the first tap of
the bell to place themselves under the
harness, Impatient to fly to the scene
of the conflagrati n. Without them,
under present c< ndltions, it would be
Impossible to get sufficient apparatus
on the ground to fight the most Insig
nificant blaze. Without the apparatus
the firemen would be of as much use as
icemen !n the inferno, and orders issued
to them by even as competent a fire
fighter as Chief Sullivan might as well
fall en deaf ears.
It can readily be seen, therefore, what
a high place the horse must hold In the
economy of fire-lighting. "Without
him," as the song goes, "what's the
band?" That Chief Sullivan and his
aids appreciate the Importance of the
horse in their calculations is shown by
thÂ© specimens of that animal in the de
partment stables, the care that is taken
In their training and the feeding and
housing they get. The work cut out
for them In this city over the steep
grades is hard, and only the strongest
can do it. Such are the horses in har
ness In the engines, trucks and water
rs of the San Francisco depart
ment
It has been the custom to limit the
ages of eligibility of horses for the de
partment to between four and seven
years. In Borne instances, where the
animal is an extraordinary specimen,
the limit is raised to eight, never be

Poor CARLOTTA'. The memory
of her is woven in among the
saddest experiences of my life.

AÂ« a member -a lady in waitingâ of
her court in the City of Mexico, thirty
four years ago, I take up my pen to
inFcribe her story, the parallel of which
is not contained in history, certainly
history-
Carlotta. daughter of Leopold I of
Belgium, wife of Maximilian of Mexico,
and namesake of th- Duchess of
Kent, cousin of Queen Victoria, friend
,genie, sister of the King of Bel
gium, alth'nueh linked in countless
ways to the present time, has yet been
as one dead for a third of a century.
In her own country her name is an un
spoken one. In the City of Mexico
of th" monuments and decora
tions of the city bear tribute to her
memory, while at the rastlo of Mira
ln Trieste, the recent home <>f the
late unfortunate Empress of Austria,
are still many evidences of Carlotta's
nee there.
Born a princess, and educated to wear
a crown, now, although Carlotta has
lived but fifty-nine years, thirty-three
of them have been passed within the
walls of an asylum for the insane. Mar
: ed at 17, a Queen at 24 and a lunatic
â¢ 26, she was bereft of father, hus
band, empire and reason in the short
ppace of eighteen months, and then, by
the irony of fate, forever banished from
human memory. Carlotta's carper was
almost kinetoscopic in the rapidity of
ieila,
its Gaugesâ promising: In its inception,
lificent in its rise, pathetic, dra
matic, tragic in its decline and fall.

Having sized up the candidate's tem

engine or truck, preferably the former,
as It Is heavier, with one of the equine
veterans, his mate in size and disposi
tion, no effort being made to match
them in color. The two are then taken
out ar.d given a run of several blocks,
finishing up with a pull up a steep

that lire horses, unlike poets, are made,

their duty is simple and direct, and in

Carlotta is more In affinity with the
American people than are other daugh
ters of kings, because she came, even
through misguided enterprise, to a land
whose border Is our own, and the study
claims one of these spectators. "Did
you ever see anything like the excite
ment that takes possession of them at
the mere thought of a fire?"
Yen admit that you never did, and
the enthusiastic spectator, who has
of her life and character, her ambitions,
triumphs and utter failure must find
sympathetic response in the heart of
every American woman* If. her star had
reached its zenith later in the century
her memory would have lived, perpetu
ated by her sisters, not for the ambi
tious Empress, but for the high princi
ple of genuine womanhood evidenced by
the good she did and the charities Bbc
dispensed.
The childhood of f'arlotta was ren
dered serious with responsibilities and
tuition beyond her ypÂ»rs. Her mother,
whom history has named the "Holy
Queen," died when the little girl was
ten years old, and for several years the
dark cloud of mourning overshadowed
the palace. Court etiquette and queen
ly dignity, amounting to austerity,
were constantly instilled Into her brain
and heart and made the deepest and
most lasting impressions upon Carlot
ta's childhood. While yet a child she
knew thoroughly the inviolate rules of
court precedence.
Her father educated har to be a
queen. She was precocious, and un
wisely he forced upon her responsibili
ties far beyond her years. At seventeen
she was far in advance of her years in
intelligence, and It was then that she
met her hero. Archduke Maximilian,
younger brother of Francis Joseph.
Emperor of Austria. He was tall and
fair and gentle, of military bearing and
spotless character, and eight years her
senior. . It was a case of love at first
Sight and in two months they were
married. She. ambitious, energetic,
possessed of the executive force of a
man; he, weak, vacillating, trustful In
the goodness of men and idealized into
her hero.
For five years they lived at Miramar
probably made the same observations
a hundred times over to as many casual
acquaintances, rattles on.
"You bet they want to get there.
They seem to know as much about It as
the firemen."
All enthusiasts think the same wayâ
that the fire horse was born to the busi
ness. They see the slashing bays, or
grays, or blacks, as the case may be.
Jump to their places. They see equine
eyes flash and horses' ears go back, the
tails swish and the hoofs stamp in the
few seconds it takes to prepare them
to respond to the alarm. Then, with
the driver in his seatâ "They're off!'
For the moment, certainly, the horse
is transformed. He appears an equine
deity, striking sparks with his iron-shod
heels from the cobbles he spurns as he
races along, his harness glittering and
Jingling, smoke streaming from the
engine. He is the one grand figure so
powerful as to appear irresistible. No
wonder the fire horse Is a popular hero;
no wonder you hear marvelous tales of
his intelligence and bravery.
It stands to reason, of course, that
the animals owned by the department
are of a superior class. If they were
not they would not be in the depa^
ment. The rigid examinations by the
veterinary, followed by the testa of the
trainer, prove that every animal is
pound in wind and limb, at the perfec
tion of youthful strength, and capable
of putting every pound of his registered
weight into the work for which he is
destined. To keep the horse In this
health is the main problem with his
masters. It is only possible with ex
treme care. The animals are washed,
currycombed and dusted unceasingly;
they are exercised at such intervals as
have been found the most profitable;
they are given good stalls, with plenty
of clean barley straw to bed them; and,
above all, they are fed after the most
modern and reasonable fashion. None
of your hard grain for the fire horse.
The day for that has passed, in San
Francisco at least. He gets the best of
hay and oats, but the oats are steamed.
There is no danger that a hard kernel
may get into th*Â» digestive apparatus of
one of the department horses and give
him that excruciating affliction, appen
dicitis. Under this regimen his coat
keeps glossy and his eye bright.
To every driver his is the best horse
in the departmentâ can do everything
but talk. He generally calls him
"Major," or "Prince," or "Dandy," rr.bs
the animal's nose when he has nothing
else to do. and is willing to expatiate on
the equine wonders under his control
till the bell taps or the cows come home.

prodigy, has a name. When he is pa. 1

Maximilian having been appointed
Governor of the Lombard-Venetian
kingdom, and there Carlotta passed the
few untroubled years of her life.
Then, at the very acme of all that
was beautiful and harmonious in her
life, the Goddess of Fortune appeared
with her tempting offer of a scepter
and a crown. It was the story of the
Garden of Eden told again in different
phase, and once more it was Eve who
fell, for it. was due to Carlotta's am
bition more than to the importunities
of the Mexican delegation that Maxi
milian finally accepted the golden apple
of empire and thus attuned the instru
ment which was destined to play his
own and his wife's requiem. However,
to the credit of Maximilian Be it said,
the first offer was unqualifiedly de
ollne-1, but when the delegation came
the second time, bearing what seemed
to be proofs that a majority of all the
people of Mexico joined with them in
the request, he yielded, and the first act
of the tragedy began.
The reception of the embassy at the
castle of Miramar is a tableau which
closes the last act of the drama of
â¢ 'arlotta's life before the curtain rose
upon the tragedy. It presents a picture
which in retrospect seems almost pro
phetic of strife, turmoil, sadness and
despair.
It is not my Intention to repeat here
history familiar to every good Ameri
can. Carlotta was the sacrifice upon
the altar of nations, and she was.ex
actly 24 years of age. Maximilian 32.
when their eyes beheld for the first
time the land where they hoped to re
generate a nation. Their entry into the
City of Mexico was a triumphal one.
The splendors of their court were un
precedented. Carlotta knew how to be
an Empress. I shall never forget her
in her royal robes of state. She was
radiantly lovely, lithe and graceful of
figure, eminently befitted to adorn a
crown.
The royal pair resided at the palace
of Chapultopec, which Is four miles
from the city, on the outskirts of Tacu
baya, at the extremity of the Paseo de
la Reforms, one of the rft ost magnifi
cent boulevards in the world and
which, under the delicate touch of Car
lotta's genius and taste, became, and
remains to-day, the most beautiful.
The palace, or as it was then called, the
castle of (JhapuHepec, was at that time
an uninviting mass of chaotic masonry,
surmounting a gigantic agglomeration
of bowlders which some prehistoric
s"ismic disturbance had projected out
of the level plain.- Tt was practically
in the same condition in which the
Americans left it after the battle
which has made its name historic.
The beautiful park which surrounds
it was neglected, the resort of wander
ing animals and bandits, and Carlotta's
first work was its renovation. Her deft
hand loft its imprint everywhere
among the giant cypress trees in the
park, in the now and winding road
ways, among the new statuary, in the
rejuvenation of Mnntezuma's Bath, in
every vista that the eyes sought and
in every pathway upon which the feet
could tread. Her own. private garden
was. and still' remains, upon the roof
of the castle, and there, among her
favorite flowers, the young Empress
and her husband passed their hours of
leisure. There she tended the growing
plants with her own hands: there no
servant ever entered save under spe
cific directions, and from it even the
Emperor was excluded by his own
order, except when invited to partici
pate in its beauties by its fair autocrat.
There are, to-day, growing trees and
shrubs in Carlotta's garden which were
planted by her own hands, and there is
in preservation a bod of violets exactly
as she planned and cared for it.
Stranger still, in that land of changes,
the gardener who assisted Carlotta
presides over this spot still. Old and
overtaken by any of the ills that equinw
flesh is heir to, there are provided for
him hospital accommodations that can
not be improved upon. He is returned
to the training stables, where, under
the care of Superintendent Harris and
his men, he has everything that would
tend to alleviate suffering and put him
on the high road to recovery. There
are all the attendants possible; the vet
erinary is there for the smallest ail
ment, the dispensary has a full supply
of every drug useful for the horse.
There is the best of ventilation and
sewerage and the softest of lights.
Comparatively, the hospital accommo
dations provided throughout the coun
try for humanity are not so complete
as the hospital for horses maintained
by the San Francisco Fire Department.
When the afflicted animal is convales
cing there is an exercising yard of
warm sand, where he can take his sun
bath and romp and roll till he is himself
again.
One team, above all others, has car
ried to Its separation by death the hon
ors for all its brethren. There were
three of them, "Pup," "Mush" and
"Bob." Their driver. Jack Hayden, is
now stationed with 21 engine, at Oak
and Devisadero streets. At the time of
the first horse show in this city the
horses were stationed at the house of
engine 2. on Bush street, near Kearny,
and there was hardly a minute of the
day when they were on duty that the
sidewalk in front of the engine house
was not filled with admirers.
"Pup." "Mush" and "Bob" were dap
ple grays, big rangy fellows with flow
ing silv( ry manes and tails that were
dreams of flumness. "Mush" was the
darkest, a steel gra'\ and will be re
membered as the off horse of the trio in
the hitch-up. Poor "Mush" went to the
boneyard moons ago. After partici
pating in the highest honors that can.
fall to a horse he fell in the discharge
of duty.
One midnight that the fashionables of
San Francisco will long remember the
bell tap summoned "Mush" and his
mates to answer an alarm of fire just
at the close of a Mardi Qras ball at the
Hopkins Institute of Art. The gray
wonders of engine 2 dashed out of their
house and ran to Dupont, up Dupont
to Pine and then took the heart-break
ing hill, up, up. to Powellâ two blocks
of the steepest grade a municipality
ever cobbled.
Engine 2 got there mainly through
the efforts of "Mush, " who cast two
shoes, so hard did he pull. Afterward
it was found the brave animal had rup
tured an intestine. For two full months
afterward he went on. responding
cheerfully to calls, then suddenly sick
ened and died. His end was so sudden
that an autopsy was determined upon.
It revealed the hidden hurt that had
brought him to his heroic death.
That death broke up the team and
now they are scattered. "Pup" is at
one station and "Bob" at another. Their
driver is at a third, but they are all
still in the department they have served
co well. Their feats will remain ever
fresh in the memory of all within the
fire lines, and many without.
bent, swarthy and forbidding of aspect,
he speaks of Carlotta as reverently as
he does of the Blessed Virgin. He keeps
alive one human heart that has not for
gotten her, and her bed of violets looks
the same now as It did when she last
knelt beside It, unconscious of the fact
that the grand structure created by her
ambition was to fall In ruins and rob
her of everything she possessed save
life.
Carlotta constituted herself president
of the Woman's Charitable Society, and
never during her stay in Mexico did
she neglect the affairs of state, regard
ing which she was at all times her hus
band's chief adviser. There is no doubt
that in the more Important measures
adopted by Maximilian she was the
brains and the potential element.
Then the United States interfered.
Napoleon was ordered to withdraw his
troops. Here again Carlotta was domi
nant. She would go herself to France
and intercede with the Emperor.
What can be more pathetic than the
spectacle of this girl Empress, then but
26 years old, pleading with the Em
peror of France and the Pope of Rome
for the means and soldiers to save from
ruin the empire of her husband, at a
time when Maximilian had been alrerMv
many weeks dead, murdered by the
people he had vainly tried to rule? The
wife, pleading for the husband's pres
ervation weeks after that husband was
moldering in his untimely grave! Tha
Empress struggling against hope for
the empire which had ceased to exist,
for an Emperor who was slain!
Carlotta's ambition and pride were
crushed, her heart broken, and then
God, in His infinite mercy, drew the
veil of forgetfulness over the mind of
this earnest woman, in order that she
might bo spared the agony that must
have been hers with the knowledge of
hen husband's awful death Young â
only twenty-six â beautiful, ambitious,
loving, on the very threshold of youth
and hope, she was seized and torn from
the world by the relentless hand of un
reason, and cast into the midnight of
utter blank.
For thirty-three years she has been
banished to an oblivion that is worse
than death. In Belgium her name is
an unspoken one. but in Palace Lack
en on the outskirts of Brussels, she
has passed a third of a century waiting
for her soul's release from its useless
prison. She believes that she is still
Empress of Mexico, awaiting the re
turn of Maximilian, who has gune at
the head of his army to quell a revolt
against his authority.
Since Carlotta entered her retreat
she has been seen by no one outside her
household, which is conducted in an
imperial manner from the fortune left
her by Leopold I. Every month of the
year Carlotta holds mimic court. The
members of her household, which num
bers more than three hundred persons,
are presented to her in the same cere
monious manner in which Queen Vic
toria holds her drawing room.
She presents them with gifts, which
are formally received â the pictures
takÂ«n from the v alls of the palace are
presented, and then the following day
are restored to their places â merely to
Indulge her demented fancy. Every
courtier and lady of honor plays the
part assigned with mimic dignity.
The grounds surrounding the palace
are not less In i.rea than Manhattan
Island itself, and there Carlotta drives
about daily in her coach of state, with
her cavaliers in attendance. There,
too, she sometimes wanders among
the flowers, planning improvements,
as she did about the grounds of Cha
pultepec, in Mexico.
Poor Carlotta!

*y+ MERICA Is the birthplace of the
f I telephone. Its discovery was made
fâ j generally known In Philadelphia
V. I during June, 1876, at the Centennial
JL Exposition, and the story of Its In
vention Is in many respects the
most marvelous and interesting part of
this one of the world's wonders.
Alexander Graham Bell, the genius who
gave it scientific birth, was born in Edin
burgh, Scotland, In 1847. His father. Alex
ander Mellville Bell, was the inventor of
what Is known as '-visible speech"â a sys
tem of teaching deaf mutes how to speak
by Indicating to them through visible
characters the combinations of the vocal
chords necessary to produce articulate
sounds. To the life work of his father
young Bell decided to devote himself.
After a preparatory training he entered
London University in 1567, but his health
failed him and he left shortly afterward.
In 1670, In company "with his parents, he
went to Canada.
Realizing that the United States offered
a broader field for the work that he had
In view, young Bell In 1872 came to the
United States and settled in Boston,
where he Introduced his father's system
of visible speech for the education of
deaf mutes. He supported himself at first
with private classes.
Meanwhile young Bell had commenced
experiments In that branch of physics and
electricity which embraces sound. The art
of telegraphy afforded an alluring field for
research, and about the time he came to
this country he conceived the Idea that a
system of multiple telegraphy might be
evolved from the principle tnat the va
rious chords of a musical Instrument are
â sensitive to sounds of different pitch.
While In Canada he worked out a system
of multiple telegraphy on this basis, and
upon locating in Boston he interested
Gardiner Hubbard and Thomas Sanders,
two gentlemen of wealth, in his experl-
They had confidence in the young man,
and the three entered a partnership, it
being agreed that Messrs. Hubbaxd and
Sanders should defray the expenses of
the experiments necessary to complete

means of support. He spent all day in the
class room, and when night camÂ© devoted
his time to study and experiment, Borne
time, in 1874 there occurred to him the idea
that possibly the human voice itself might
lie transmitted end reproduced by means
of the electric current. His partners,
Messrs. Hubbard and Sanders, preferred,
however, that the young man should de
vote himself to the completion of his
system of multiple telegraphy, and rather
discouraged his seemingly impracticable
Idea for the transmission of speech by the
electric current.
The year of 1876 dawned dark and
gloomy enough on the struggling young
inventor. After he had completed his sys
tem of multiple telegraphy and applied
for his patent he found that his title to
an original Invention was contested by
the distinguished scientist, Elisha Gray
of Philadelphia. He went to Washington
to look after his interests, and while
there called on the veteran physicist and

secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.
In the course of his interview with Pro

There were aboul fifty swarthy and
powerful peons, or semi-slave, half
breeds, working under me, and I had
.absolute power over them. I also had
a privilege of taking on new hands.
"One day a curious little Mexican ap
plied for work at the mill. He seemed

a bold step. On March IS he wrote to his
father and mother:

studying and experimenting. Meanwhile
the situation had become complicated.
â¢In the course of his association with his
partner, Mr. Hubbard, he had met the
charming young daughter of that distin
guished philanthropist, then Miss Mabel
[Ã¼bbard. They had fallen in love with
one another. The pride of the Scotch
gentleman of small means, which has
been so charmingly characterized in the
novels of Sir "Walter Scott, was exag
gerated in young Bell. The expense of
his actual experiments â¢In multiple tele
graphy had been defrayed by his part
ners in the enterprise. But that or the
telephone experiments fell entirely on
him, and his slender. purse was taxed to
the utmost to meet the calls upon it. He
was unwilling to go to the father of his
fiancee and ask a loan to help him defray
his living expenses, and those incident to
the purchase and construction 01 expen
sive apparatus. Neither was he willing
to turn to his parents for aid; and with
his sole source of revenue cut off by the
dismissal of his classes, he found himself
reduced to the verge of actual want. At
this iuuctnre a friend came forward and
loaned him a small sum of money on the
security of his prospective earnings from
teaching during the coming winter.
With this he struggled on. The date of
the real discovery of the telephone might
be said to be June 2, 1575. On that day
Bell was standing by one of his harmonic
instruments, when his assistant accident
ally tapped the connecting instrument
â with his hand. The slight noise proceed
ing from the nearby receiver would have
escaped the attention of a less skilled ob
server than Bell. To him it sounded as
distinct as the crack of a pistol. Again
and again the excited young scientist
made his assistant repeat the lapping
with his finger on the connected har
monic Instrument, while he stood with
his ear to. the receiving instrument, list
ening delightedly to the sounds that is
sued from it. Within the hour he gave
orders for the construction of exactly
such a telephone as in the preceding fall
he had described to Dr. Blake. The elec
tric speaking telephone was then a prac
tical certainty. ;V- _ .
One hour after the application was filed

goat.

after great difficulty and in the closing

had wandered in "nehind a ledge of rock

Then the man struck a match to find
his goat, when he saw a gleaming cru
cifix In the darkness beyond.
" 'Along on the ledges about him

but the weight of their load had long
burst them, and the floor of the cave
was a vast heap of dust-covered gold

coins and dashed out of the cave and
thence on down the mountain side as
if pursued by demons.
" 'He kept his secret well for five
days; then he came to me, his one
friend and confidant. When I saw the
coins I was crazy. We planned to go
up to the mountain canyon the next
day, and we did bo. I saw that the
man spoke the truth. I drove my hand

Well. In handling the piece there the
pistol went off and shot poor Paolo
through the heart. Dumb with terror,
I seized hat and staff and dashed from
the cave, hurrying below.
" 'For five days there was no search
for poor Paolo. Then my aunt came to
me and said, "Francesco, you have on
Paolo's hat. You must have seen him

Immediately Government officials were

" 'The country was in an uproar over
the discovery. It was thought that

that they were somewhere in the moun

MOST FIENDISH EXECUTIONER
LIVING AT THE PRESENT DAY
A MAN whose boast is that he ha^taken one hun
dred and sixty-two lives and whose proud delight
is to enlarge upon the several and original meth
ods employed in this cold-blqoded butchery can
hardly be believed possible In this civilized close
of the nineteenth century. In the olden days of French
revolution, the Spanish Inquisition and the gory red ax of
robber German barons, suoh characters cut out many a
cruel page of bloody history, but for such a monster to ex
ist in th^se days of mercy and to have ruled at the very
door of our own free country seems almost incredible. Yet
such a one does live and, until quite recently, held full and
brutal sway as "professional executioner" for Maceo in
Santiago de Cuba. This brute, for he Is little else. Is named
"Tien Con." ' He is a burly negro, coal black, with beetling
brows and sunken, beady eyes of snakelike brilliancy, cruel,
cold and seldom blinking. His large mouth, massive chin
and strong white dog teeth give but a hint of his marvel
ous physical strength. His muscles stand out on arms and
shoulders like great ripe cocoanuts. Never has "Tren Con"
been known to miss or take two blows with his keen ma
cheta on a quivering, helpless victim.
Maceo made this black fiend his official executioner with
full discretionary power, and the dark tales of devilish
tortures as well as the negro's own boast of 162 heads indi
cate that h- carried out the duties of his horrible office
well and to the full limit of authority.
"Tren Con" is now in the hands of the American soldiers
at Morro to be tried for murder, and will doubtless soon be
a thing of the past.
He was .captured with thirty other robbers, members of
a band under his own leadership, who had been the terror
of the country people until the boys in blue "rounded up"
the bandits, capturing the thirty aforementioned besides
killing thirteen.
Since his lmprisomnenl he has neve* uttered a single word
of regret for the many lives that are written against his- name
In the book of Judgment; but on the contrary has taken espe
cial delight In- regaling bia guards with sickening accounts of
Ingenious methods for extracting information from political
prisoners and the .proper etiquette governing the office of oub
lic "executions. He seems to fear nothing in the realization of
the fact that he must Boon pay the penalty of his crimes by
himself suffering the death penalty, and in discussing the mat
ter merely says that he could perform the job better than any
bungling American executioner. He is closely watched lest he
should increase his horrible record of 162 lives to 183â with him

soldiers demanded that we go clown to
the city and $et permission of the gov
ernment to pass into the mountains.
This I knew was impossible to do just
then, and we went down in the
direction thirty miles utterly disconso
late, my companion continually calling
to me to wheel round and do the trick
that would liberate us.
"Not da-ring to enter the city, we
ramped outside for flve days, unde

th^iÂ« came a woman on the scene. She

was the only one in the country who
had recognized him as a new personal

about the place, and then the girl dis
with the Commissioner of Patents Elisha
Gray of Philadelphia also filed a caveat
warning Inventors against any attempt to
patent an instrument such as the tele
phone, as he was doing some work looking
to the transmission of speech by the elec
tric current. Had this been filed before
Bell's application, there is a possibility
that he would not have been granted a
patent.
Patent No. 174.465, perhaps the most im
portant ever allowed by the United States
Patent Office, was issued on March 7. IS7G.
to Graham Bell for his original invention
of an electric speaking telephone.
Meanwhile Bell sent the rude instru
ments which constituted his first tele
phone on to the Centennial Exposition in
Philadelphia. They were placed in an ob
scure corner of the Massachusetts ex
hibit, and attracted little or no attention.
Gardiner Hubbard was attending the
Exposition during the latter part of June.
He learned that on Sunday, June 28, the
board of judges of the exposition, includ
ing Professor Henry and Sir William
Thomson, since Lord Kelvin, would. In
company with the Emperor of Brazil, in
spect some of the inventions in harmonics
of the distinguished scientist, Elisha
Gray. As a special favor Mr. Hubbard
obtained from them a promise to allow
young Bell to show his telephone contriv
ance to the party. He then telegraphed
Bell to come to Philadelphia.
Class work at this time was pressing,
and Bell had about made up his mind
to let the night train for New York and
Philadelphia leave without him when
some one announced that Miss Hubbard
was awaiting him in her carriage.
"Why. aren't you ready to go to
Philadelphia?" was the question which
greeted him.
The young man began to explain about
duties which would deter him from tak
ing the trip.
"Well, come take a drive with me."
said his fiancee. He got In the carriage
Immediately and was driven to the tta
tion. There Miss Hubbard descended. Mr.
Bell did likewise.
The New York train was already wait-
Ing on the track, with steam up, ready
to pull out.
"Mr. Bell, you are going to Philadelphia
to exhibit your invention," was the de
cided order that the young man received.
And go to Philadelphia he did.
The next mortilng Bell arrived In Phil
adelphia and prepared to exhibit his tele
phone. Sir William Thomson Professor
Henry and the Emperor of Brazil had
taJten a long time in examining the really
remarkable invention of El!sh,a Gray and
must have felt considerably bored when
young Bell finally gained their attention.
But he had not proceeded far before they
became intensely interested. After ex
plaining the theory of the telephone, Bell
placed Sir William Thomson at one of his
instruments, and stationing another mem
ber of the party at the other, he told them
to go ahead and talk to one another.
"To be, or not to be, that is the ques
tion?" began Sir "William. "Do you hear
me?" The answer came back, "Yes,
quite plainly." The memberg of the party
were simply astounded. The Emperor of
Brazil was then stationed at one of the
instruments and carried on an animated
conversation with Elisha Gray, who
stated his wonder at the marvelous in
vention of Bell.
For a week Sir William, Professor
Henry and others experimented with and
examined the telephone instruments.
When they had satisfied themselves as to
the great scientific and practical value of
the invention, no words of praise from
them for Bell and his telephone could
prove too strong.

"Francesco was like one insane after
that. What tidings the girl brought or
whether he told her his secret or not,
I never discovered. Once more and for

I stood my ground, and the next morn

Bell himself 'discovered that a armor
convenient form of receiver than the
piece of iron attached to a membrane was
one which substituted a circular iron dibK
tirmlv clasped in front of a magnet. This
was found to vibrate in much beuar
unison with the transmitter into which
words were spoken at the other end or
the circuit. â¢,-.-:.â¢ "* 'Â ,_,,.
Although a precisely similar contriv
ance to the Bell receiver, as it Is now
generally called, will serve as a trans
mitter as well, an improved form or
transmitter, known as the Blake carbon
transmitter! has now been generally
adopted. This form of transmitter sub
stitutes for the magnet behind the iron
diaphragm a number of small pieces or
loose carbon placed between a carbon dia
phragm and a solid support. Carbon was
found to be preferable to metal on ac
count of its peculiar properties for trans
mitting sound. So delicate and suscepti
ble to sound is the carbon transmitter
that the footfalls of a fly crossing the
carbon disk produce a perceptible sound
in the telephone. _
The carbon transmitter substitutes ror.
the impulses of electricity, which were
induced in the original form of transmit
ter by the action of the iron diaphragm
on the magnet, an electric current which
passes directly through the carbon dia
phragm and the loose carbon behind it.
In this case, the vibrations of the voice
falling on the carbon disk affect the cur
rent directly.
The electrical impulses are accentuated
by the motion transmitted through the
disk to the loose carbon. In this shape
they are transmitted to the wire, ana
a series of impulses corresponding ex
actly. in rapidity and shape or quality to
those sent out are then reconverted Into
facsimile pounds at the receiving Instru
ment. , ..
The method described Is known as the
battery system, and is in general use at
present on all lines of any great length.
In the most improved instruments thÂ«
Blake carbon transmitter is used In con
nection with the Bell receiver.
Specially contrived batteries are now
used for reinforcing the current on long
distance lines, and magnetic coils arÂ»
used to convert the electric vibrations
caused by the voice into suitable form
for long distance transmission. A thou

The growth of the colony, though
slow at first, became more rapid after
the middle of the seventeenth century,
as its importance began to be more ap
preciated by the Dutch East India
Company. With visiting ships came
men from all nationalities, and loads
of young Dutch women were regularly
sent out from Holland to provide them
with wives. The revocation of the
edict of Nantes, 1685, sent several hun

salaries, which consumed more than
two -thirds of the whole revenue. All
trade with countries >-nst of the Cape
was reserved for the English Kast In
dia Company and heavy duties were
imposed on all goods brought from the
West In other than English bottoms.
The Government fixed the price at
which the farmers should furnish sup
plies to the garrison and ships of war
calling at the Cape, and further large
issues of paper money were made. Op
pressive personal laws, tyrannically
enforced, abridged the liberties of the
colonists and kept them in a state of
sullen discontent. An influx of 5000
British settlers in IX2O-21 was followed
by a decree requiring all official docu
ments to be published in English and
all proceedings in the courts of law to
be in that language, and then that all
memorials and petitions addressed to
the Government should be in English
or have a translation attached. The
outside Circuit Courts were done away
with and aJI criminal cases required to
be taken to Cape Town. In no other
colony has Great Britain ever pursued
such harsh measures as were had in
dealing with the BoÂ«-rs.
The reduction of the value of the
paper money, much of which had been
Issued by the Government, to three
eighths of the face of the notes, and
making English silver legal tender at
that rate of exchange, caused a lose
of some $4,000,000 to the colonists, most
of which fell upon the farmers in the
outlying settlements.
A military police, composed of Hot
tentots under English officers, was .an
other great cause of complaint.
Finally the last straw came in the
shape of the emancipation proclamation
putting an end to slavery in the colony
after December 1, 1834. The "Great
Trek" began in 1835. The Boer farmers,
almost to a man, left Cape Colony and
sought new homes in the unexplored
regions to the northeast.
It was proposed to pay the colonists
for their slaves set free. A commission
fixed their value at about $15,000,000.
Of this amount the home Government
cut off two-thirds actually and the rest
practically, by requiring each claim to
be proved before a commission in Lon
don, and payment then to be made in
3^ per cent stock.
The farmers could not well make the
disloyal to the city as to vote against the
adoption of the ordinance.
This pine tree was first made known to
the world by Dr. C. C. Parry, a noted
botanist and member of the Mexican
Boundary Commission in 1850, who, finding
it "was a new species, dedicated It to the
veteran American botanist. Dr. John
Torrey who may be called the father of
systematic botany in America. This plant,
so far as the United Stattw is concerned,
is practically confined to the locality near
J,a Jolla, though It is said that a few scat
tered trees are found near San Pedro, in
the mountains of Lower California and on
Santa Rosa Island. The tree is known to
thÂ© world only thraurn San. Diego. For
long journey to London, and, selling
their claims for a small fraction of their
face, forswore allegiance to the British
crown, abandoned everything they
could not readily carry with them and
"outspanned" into the unbroken wil
derness.
The exodus began in 1835, and for the
next three years party after party of
Boers, numbering from ten to 11 ft y
families, carrying all their belongings
in huge wagons drawn by ten or twelve
span of oxen each, poured from Cape
Colony across the orange River and
then over the Drakensberg Mountains
Into the more inviting country of Na
tal.
Sir George Napier, then Governor of
Cape Colony, in a proclamation issued
in July, 1838. set forth the principle
which has governed the attitude of the
British Government toward the Boers
ever since. It invited the Boers to re
turn, and at the same time informed
them that her Majesty's Government
was ".determined not to permit the cre
ation of any pretended independent
States by any of her Majesty's sub
jects, which the emigrant farmers con
tinued to be." The Boers protested,
then resisted, but were overpowered,
and in 1843 Natal was proclaimed to be
a British province.
They spread out over what is now
the Orange Free State and some of
them crossed the Vaal River and blazed
the way for a larger emigration that
waÂ« soon to follow.
British aggression followed them into
the Orange country, and in spite of th.^
warnings of Pretorious, their leader,
that the Boers would resist or "trek"
again. In 1848 the country between the
Orange and Vaal Rivers was proclaim
ed to be British territory, under the
title of the Orange River Sovereignty.
The Boers gathered and fought, but
were beaten In the battle of Boomplatz,
near Bloemfontein a.nd most of them
"trekked"' across the vaal, to join th-ir
companions, leaving their farms to
British emigrants from Cape Colony.
Again they formed a new republic,
the Independence of which was formal
ly recognized by the British in January,
1852, by what was called the Sand River
Convention, which "guaranteed in the
fullest manner on the part of the Brit
ish Government, to the emigrant farm

a number of years a wanton destruction
of the grove near La .Tolla had been going

cut dnwn for firewood. Doubtless this
will cease now that the land is to be set
apart as a park reservation.
The wild seedlings <lo not bear trans
planting. A few years ago the County
Board of Supervisors, with a praisewor

of these trees, had a dozen removed to
the Courthouse grounds in San Diego, but
to-day not one Is living to tell the tale.

There has been a great demand on the
part of European botanists and horti
culturi.-ts fur seeds of this pine, and they
have been largely-- cultivated in Europe,
more for their rarity, however, than for
their beauty.
The Pinus Torreyana is a small tree
twenty or thirty feet high and twelve to
fifteen Inches In diameter. The leaves are
crowded at the ends of the thick branch
lets In the axils of lanceolata, strongly
fringed braots, very stout, eight to twelve
lnehÂ«Â« long, young sheaths fifteen to
â¢lghteen lines long, old ones six lines
long (a line Is one-twelfth of an
inch); cones ovate, four to four and one
half Inches long by three and one-half
inches thick, patulous or defluxed on pe
ducles an inch long; umbo short and stout
or sometimes elongated and lnnexed;
seeds oval, eight to ten Hues long, twice
as long as the wing which encloses the
â eed. The Plnus Torreyana Is fifty miles
from any other species of pine. In many
respects It resembles the historic Pinus
Plnea of the ancients, which has-been
cultivated from time Immemorial.
In a paper read before the San Diego
Society of Natural History November 2,
1883 the discoverer of the Pinus Torrey
ana Dr C. C. Parry, tells how he found
the rare and interesting pine tree. He
said- "In the spring ot 1850, when con
nected with the Mexican boundary sur
vey my attention was first called to a
peculiar species of pine growing on the
Pacific Coast at the mouth of the Sole
dad Valley, San Diego County, by a cas
ual inquiry from Dr. J. L. Le Conte, the
distinguished American entomologist,
then staying In San Diego, asking 'what
pine It was growing near the ocean beach
at that locality? Not having any speci
mens to show, he simply mentioned at the
times Its dense cones and its long, stout
leaves, five In a sheath. Not long after
an opportunity offered the writer for a
personal investigation, having been or
dered by Major W. H. Emory to make a
geological examination of the reported
coal deposits on the ocean bluff above
Soledad.
"In making a section of these strata
it was necessary to follow up some of the
â harp ravines that here debouch on the
ocean beach, and here my attention was
taken up by this singular and unique
maritime pine, which, with its strong
clusters of ttrminal leaves, and Its dis
torted branches loaded dow.i with pon
derous cones, was within easy reach of
botanical clutch. From the note? and
collections there made a description was
drawn up dedicating this well-marke.i
new species to an honored friend and in
structor both of Le Conte and the writer,
viz.. Dr. John Torrey of New York, as
Plnus Torreyana, Parry.
Though sixteen years have passed since
Dr Parry read that paper before the His
torical Society, it was' only within the
past few weeks that steps were taken to
set apart the pueblo lands upon which tha
Plnus Torreyana stand for park purposes.
An electric road may soon be running to

extension of the road will be built to the

themselves, according to their own
laws, without any interference on the
part of the British Government, and
that no encroachment should be made
by the said Government upon the terri
tory north of the Vaal River."
The Boers prospered in their new
home in spite of dissensions among
themselves :ind troubles with their na
tive neighbors, and in 1877 the idea of
annexing them to the British Crown
again took definite shape..
Sir Theophilus Shepstone, on behalf of
the British Government, came Into the
country on a visit of inspection, and af
ter consulting with a few of the inhabi
tants, on April 12, 1877, hoisted the Brit
ish Hag at Rustemberg, not far from
Pretoria. An interval of peaceful but
strong protest against this violation of
the Sand River Convention was follow
ed in December, 1880, by an uprising of.
the Boers, led by such men as Kruger.
Jnubert and others, who are still leaders
In Transvaal affairs. The British gar
risons in the towns were besieged and
when a strong force was sent from
Natal, under Sir Evelyn Wood, to their
assistance, the Boers met them at the
border and In four successive engage
ments, defeated them with terriblo loss,
especially of officers, and at small cost
to themselves.
At Majuba Hill, the last and most dis
astrous engagement to the British of
this seven weeks' war, they had every
advantage of position, on the summit of
Majuba Hill, where they were attacked
on February 26. 1881, by an inferior
force of Boers in three columns. Out
flanked and surrounded, the whole Brit
ish force, among whom were the fa
mous Gordon Highlanders, broke and
fled in utter rout, leaving many
dead on the field. A peace dictated by
the Boers, reaffirming the guarantee of
1852, was forced from General Wood,
who withdrew his forces.
The Transvaal Government has no
standing army, and, with the exception
of four volunteer organizations of 1200
men, know little of marching in line and
drilling, but they have some 38,000 able
men ready for service on short notice,
as was seen by the promptness with
which the Jamieson raid was ended in
18!Â»6. In the last three years they have
expended some $8,000,000 for arms and
ammunition, all of the most improved
patterns.
CORNSTALKS FOR NATIONAL DEFENSE
UNITED STATES NAVY WILL CARRY A
EELT OF CELLULOSE ARMOR.
ANEW device in warship construction
baa been found, which, it is believed,
â¢will make the American navy, chip
for ship, the superior of any other In
the world. Curiously enough, the ma
terial for this improvement comes, not
from our seaboard products, but from the
waste of Western farms. ItÃ value lies
in the fact that it will prevent a vesiel'9
fighting ability from beinK destroyed even
after she has been pierced in a dozen
places.
Mr. Lewis Nixon, formerly a United
StateÃ naval constructor, and who Is now
engaged In building warships for the Gov
ernment at Ellzobethport, N. J., says of
the new invention:
"The value of some light substance that
will preserve the stability of light
armored vessels by displacing water that
might filter after a projectile has been
appreciated by naval constructors ever
since we began to build steel armored
vessels.
"To meet this need the French orig
inated the use of cellulose, which, .when
fired into, swells up under the Influence
of water and prevents further inflow.
After various trials It was adopted in
our navy. Thus, In the Columbia, tho
Boers Defeat Gordon Highlanders on Majuba Y\U\-
Since the discovery of the rich gold
fields within their borders, bringing in
a large influx of foreigners, mostly
British, and the gradual cutting them
off from any further "trekking" by
British annexation of the country to the
west and north of them, they have seen
the Inevitable and prepared for a last
and long struggle.
They may be successful for a time.
PREVENTS WATER COMING IN WHEN
PIERCED BY PROJECTILES.
New York and the Olympia, there are
protective decks of ample strength to keep
out the shells of any vessels they are
liable to engage, while their stability is
protected by belts of cellulose several feet
thick along the edges.
"No thoroughly satisfactory cellulose
material for this purpose was discovered,
however, until the pith of cornstalkÃ was
utilized in its manufacture. Corn pith Is a
perfect obturator. It absolutely prevents
water from coming- in by the opening
made by an 8-tnch shell. When chemically
treated It Is thoroughly fireproof and in
every way It meets the requirements of
the situation. , . *
"For keeping out water a celluloÃÂ© belt
of three feet may be said to be about as
efficient as a 6-lnch belt of steel, so that
we can protect our stability, when we
have & good protective deck back of it to
protect the vitals, with 100 tons of cellu
lose, where we should require 1000 tons of
armor."
The use of corn pith for this purpose
was suggested several years ago by Pro
fessor Mark W. Mersden, who had ob
served Its remarkable absorbent quali
ties. Ke brought the matter to the at
tention of the Cramps, and at their sug
gestion de-vised an apparatus for separ
ating the pith from the stalk. In 1595 the
naval authorities were induced to make
a test of the new product. A 250-pound
projectile was fired through a steel coffer

their midst and the might of the British
Empire against them from without all

dam packed -with cellulose three feet
thick. The shell made a hole a foot in
diameter through the structure. The
water was Immediately turned on and
continued for an hour. At the end of
that time not a drop had come through,
and the packing at the hole In the rear
of the plate was not even dampened.
Three factories now In operation are
pmployed In turlng out the product. The
largest of them is at Owensboro, Kv.
The others are at Rockford, 111., and
Chester, Pa.
Sinct- the whole process of this manu
facture is a new one, the machinery by
which It is carried on had to be espe
cially devised. The problems which it
presented baffled the inventor for tome
time, but he has at length succeeded in
perfecting machinery which make it pos
sible to turn out the finished products on
a large scale.
The stalks must be well ripened before
cutting-, and must be thoroughly cured.
After stripping off the ears the farmer
hauls the stalks to the factory, where
thuy are paid for at the rate of $3 per
ton.
The piles of stalks, Just as they come
to the factory, are fed into big cutting
machines, which chop them into short
lengths. Elevating shafts carry them to
the roof of the factory, where they pass
over great screens with fans to separate
the leaves and lighter parts.
An ingenious machine, with upright
knives, strips off the "shlve," the hard
outer portion of the Btalk and the tough
fibers that run lengthwise of the stem.
Only the soft inner portion is left.
From the stripping machines the wholÂ»
mass falls upon long traveling strips or
canvas. The elastic nature of the pith
causes It to bound up and down on the
canvas until it falls' off into a receptacle
prepared for it. The chopped up stalks
and leaves go on to the end of the travel
ing curtains, where they are dumped into
cribs.
The pith goes next to the compressor,
where it is packed to about one-fourth
its former bulk. Even then It is so light
that only about three tons can be packed
into an ordinary freight car. The other
products are carried away for mixture
into the prepared food in which they are
used.
For a new industry the cornstalk busl
nrps is remarkably active. By the end of
a decade the statistics of the cornstalk
industry will probably be counted in mil
lions, and its influence in adding to the
prosperity of the great corn belt should
be very marked.

VICTORY'S SIGN BLAZES FORTH MILES ABOVE THE SEA.
A SIGNAL LIGHT IN THE
CLOUDS.
COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., July
4.â lt has been left to Colorado to
plan and carry to a successful
conclusion the grandest celebration of
our nation's birth and glory ever
dreamed of by the most patriotic of her
citizens.
From time almost immemorial, ever
since war has been a part of human
life, watch-fires and signal-fires, have
blazed on cliffs and hill tops as warn
ings of danger or signs of rejoicing, but
never one has blazed so broad and high
as tho mighty beacon that our State
held aloft in dual celebration of our
country's day of independence and the
reception of that key of victory which
was presented to her by her gallant
son. Admiral Schley, a twelvemonth
since.
Think of a ton of red, white and blue
fire blazing on a mighty pedestal three
miles above the surface of the sens.
upon which Schley won his victory, and
two miles above the surface of the sur
rounding country! Think of it flashing
>ut its message of far-reaching import
lo city and village and hamlet, to
mountain and vale and plain, against a
background of frowning storm-clouds,
amid the blackness of a moonless
night!
This was Colorado's celebration â a
celebration which has never been
equalled, and will, most assuredly,
never be ex< ;!eu.
Pikes Peal:, the goal of wearied
westernbound pilgrims In the past, and
the historic monument of the present,
was chosen to wear, set in Its crown of
summer snow, the glowing jewel sym
bolical of the rejoicing of a nation's
sons over a nation's achievements.
On the summit -the United States
signal service building, the highest ob
servatory In the country, offered its
hospitality, and the over 2000 pounds of
chemicals provided by the loyal-spirited
citizens were conveyed thither during
the eventful day.
LÂ»ate in the afternoon five men were
sent up from Manitou by Manager Sells
of the Pikes Peak Cog Railway to take
charge of the affair, and before night
fall a dozen more came up on a special
engine to assist in making it a glorious
success.
Up they vent on the steeply slanting
cog railway which looks so dangerous
and yet is so safe; up through canyons
and natural parks, through the timber
belt and the arid region where bloom
the briiliani Alpine flowers and email
mosses nestle amid the sharp-edged
rocks. And as they climbed higher and
ever higher il>h BUn'fi rays grew paler
until the low gathering clouds shut it
away altogether, and the breeze turned
to a chilly wind that had become a
raging gale by the time the mountain
i'>p was gained.
Snow and sleet beat upon and blinded/ 1
the brave ninri as they alighted upon
the apex of th-- lonely peak. A dense
sea of cloud shut them away from all
the world; a sea through whose depths
no message could come or be sent. Lit
tle wonder is it that their hearts sank
within them, weighted with the thought
that their journey had been in vain and
that disappointment was to be the por
tion of the waiting people whose bid
ding they had come to do.
Thousands In the towns and villages
on the hills and plains below were gaz
ing eagerly toward the mighty pile of
rock on which they stood in helpless
idleness, expecting with every passing
moment to see a flaring signal rush up
ward into the inky skies to tell the
story of the beginning of their stupend
ous undertaking.
But the signal did not rise. The Storm
King held sway on that bleak Island in
the great cloud ocean, and not until he
bad proven his power and worn himself
out with the violence of his unresisted
rage did he give the human intruders
into his lofty domain the opportunity
they sought.
\Tearied at last, and perhaps feeling
an admiration for and sympathy with
the bravery of soul which enabled them
to withstand hi? attacks in the hope of

duty in such a case as this was their
pleasure, and they plunged onward
through the darkness as merrily as
schoolboys at play. '
At last the long-looked-for moment
came. A system of well-arranged sig
nals between the three groups of op

to be applied to piles of powder at al
most the same moment. Then came a
sputtering, creeping sizzle followed by
a dull, parti-colored glow, â which deep

Down below in the gigantic amphi

center and a horizon of lightning-riven
thunder clouds was the circling wall,
other hearts were beating high -with
expectant excitement.
Far up above the black timber belt,
at the vry edge of the rounding cone

three stars of flame twinkled through
the darkness.

the answering lights flash here and
there, glowing spots' of crimson flame,
shooting stars and showers of scintil

Two Curious Phases of Man`s Freakish Nature
Alameda`s Club and Their
Crusade Against Matri
mony.
THE course of matrimony, like
that of true love, does not run
smooth in Alameda. Every ob
stacle has been cast in its path
way, and if Cupid is not dis
couraged with thy outlook it is
not the fault of those who have found
marriage a. failure. A Bachelors' Club
was formed in Alameda some time ago.
It defied the god of love with much suc
cess for a time, but in the end the sly
Imp was victor and the bachelors dis
banded.
The Alameda Divorced Men's Club
sprang into existence last winter. The
city had experienced an epidemic of
divorce. Society was shocked by each
successive announcement of some
couple â who to the outer world had
basked in the sunshine of each other's
love â seeking surcease from domestic
discord.
Finally the long list of divorces cul
minated !n the announcement that
Captain A. W. yon Schmidt had been
sued by his wife for a legal separation.
Many of the captain's male friends had
been* through the divorce mill. He had
sympathized with them, and during
their matrimonial troubles had taken
much pride in referring to his own
home life as ideal, and to his murried
life a3 one of those matches which are
supposed to be made only in heaven.
Th>e Divorce Club MaKing Merry, Witb Their Ex-Wives' Pictures Turned to the Wall.
When he was forced to defend him
self from his wife's charges of inde
scribable cruelty set forth in detail m
a complaint for divorce, the whole
spirit of the man changed. He was
no longer a defender of the home. Un
declared himself v foe to matrimony
and an enemy of womankind. He
boasted that he would devote his days
on earth to the injury of both. The
weapons with which he proposed to Jo
tliis were th<- divorced men with whom
he had sympathized.
Calling them together, he suggested
the formation oÂ£ the Divorced Men's
Club. He. set forth his ideas fully. To
prevent marriage wherever possible
v.ii.- the paramount object. Every
member of the club could set himself
up as an example of the horrors and
daggers <-f matrimony. Mankind was
to be cautioned against the wile? of
women and the state of "single blessed
ness" was to be painted in the rosiest
huts. Prompted by a feeling of sym
pathy for Yon Schmidt and a feeling of
resentment against womankind on ac
count of their own unhappy expe
riences, these friends of the captain
expressed themselves in hearty accord
with his ideas.
It was thus that the Divorced Men's
Club sprung into life. Yon Scntntdt
was honored by being named its first
president and- Ward Battles was elected
secretary.
AHhmisli the? club's founder closed

his earthly career in a most atrocious
manner while the organization was still
in its (nfjuncy, virtually christening the
association in a deed of blood, the
members still hold fast to his ideas
and are carrying out his plans to the
best of their ability.
A strange feature in'th" gruesome
story of Yon Schmidt in connection with
his ideas as expressed in the objects of
the Divorced Men's Club is the fact
that although he was the loudest Ie
denouncing matrimony he found life
unbearable without the companionship
of his wife and took' her life in the most
cruel and brutal manner because she
would not lister, to hi\ prayers for.for
giveness and return t* him. Despite
his statements that a .woman's love
was not worth having he could not
quench the. spark that smoldered
within him, and when his wife lay dead
at his feet he plunged into his own
heart the blade that was still dripping
with her life's blood.
The progress of the club was not in
terrupted by the death of its founder.
Stanley Stephenson. an ex-Cfty Trus
tee, was elfvat'-d to the position of
president. The members were pledged
to the most profound secrecy, and it
was only by the merest accident that
the existence of the organization be
came known months after it had
sprang into life. While the membership
is stated to be in the neighborhood of
twenty, the names of but comparative
ly few of them have become public
property. Regular meetings are held
in a dingy 1 j tie room on Park street,
into which no gleam of sunshine can
find a way. The furniture is a round
table ami a few chairs. It is here that
the' members congregate to discuss the
welfare of mankind, according to their
lights.
Standing committees are 'supposed to
keep close watch on any outsider who
is Buspeeted of being matrimonially in
clined and make reports to the club.
These reports are considered with the
greatest care. Ways and means of sav
ing a possible victim from Cupid's
clutches are talked over with all sin
cerity and with the greatest solemnity.
After exhaustive consideration the
chairman appoints some member to in
terview the suspect, dissuade him from
his mad purpose and point out to him
the horrors of matrimony and the dan
gers of the divorce court.
The club officers claim that much
good missionary work has been done in
this line and that the war against mar
riage will be continued until Cupid will
find no field for labor in Alameda.
The emblem of the Divorced Men's
Club is a miniature coal oil can. It has
no particular significance in connection
with the objects of the organization.
When the mater of selecting & badge
or other indication of membership was
brought up it was decided that every

member should recite in detail the cir
cumstances surrounding his divorce,
and a badge suggestive of the most or
iginal and unique family fallout would
be designed.
The story related by Secretary Ward
Battles carried off the palm. As recited
to the writer by Mr. Battles, his expe
rience is a story in itself.
"My wife and I had indulged in one
of those "love spats' so common in most
families and had not spoken for a week.
I was fool enough not to appreciate the
v r alue of- a woman's silence then and
so originated a plan to break the spell.
Fixing a hook in the floor under my
wife's bedroom, I ran a long cord over
It, one end of which was passed through
a hole in the floor of my apartment. On
the other end of the string I tied a
couple of coal. oil â¢cans. That nigh* af
ter Mrs. Battles retired I set in motion
the machinery calculated to bring
about a. family reunion. Pulling the
string gently, I raised the tin cans from
the cellar floor and let them drop. There
was a terriflq rattle and bang. Pretty
soon I heard my wife moving about in
her room. She raised th? window and
I distinguished a faint 'Who's there?'
"There was no answer, of course.
When I thought it was about time for
her to be dozing again I gave the cans
another rattle. She screamed this time,
and, running into my room, shouted
that burglars were in the house and
bested me to protect her. I pretended
to be asleep, of course, but she shook
me until I had to wake Â«p. Then she
asked forgiveness for the way in which
she had treated me, told me she would
never get out of humor again ani we'
kissed and made up.
"Everything would have gone along
all right in my family if I had had
sense enough to remove the evidence of
the joke next morning. Mrs. Battles
found the tin cans and the string when
she went into" the cellar and got mad
der than ever. A few days later she
sued me* for divorce, alleging cruelty,
and my tin cans were the principal
items in the complaint."
None of the members could equal
Battles' story, and so the miniature tin
can was adopted as the emblem of the
Divorced Men's Club.
To be a divorced man is not the only
qualification for membership. An ap
plicant must bind himself by a solemn
oath to remain single for the rest of his
days before his name will be consider
ed. Men art wanted who have not only
been freed from Irksome nuptial ties.
but whose matrimonial experiences
have made fv.ture love for womankind
an impossibility.
When a new member is elected a
complete record Is made of the history
.of his married life and the domestic
dfs'cord that led to his divorce. This
record shows that some of the members
have had experiences as lively aa they
are varied.
President Stanley Stephenson enjoyed
married life for many years, and the
white-winged dove of peace hovered
over his household until he got into pol
itics. At first his wife objected to his
staying out nights, then she positively
ordered that he remain at home. Be
ing a man more easily led than driven,
he lost no opportunity to attend a pub
lic meeting or other nocturnal function
where his wife could not go. Failing
to curb his desire to associate with his
fellow-politicians, she forbid him using
tobacco. This, he thought, was perse
cution, and he would have no more of
it. He took the matrimonial bit between
his teeth and no power could hold him.
His wife sued him for a divorce and
he did not raise the slightest objection.
Joseph Maristaney, an Alameda -capi
talist, had an expensive experience
while he allowed his heart to-be a tar
pet for the darts of Cupid's bow. He
has fipured in the divorce courts more
times than any member of the Divorced
Men's Club. He has been married sev
eral times and divorced as tfiany, and it
took him a long timeyto" find out that
a larpre slice of his property went with
each successive wife. It was only after
the Divorced Men's Club was created
that a missionary from the organiza
tion pointed out the hopelessness Â«f his
search for an ideal wife.- Now Mr. Mar
istaney is one of the club's most enthu
siastic members.
Baron Alfred Baroteau, the club
steward, who prepares the refresh
ments for the organization's social ses
sions, married a .rich widow some years
his senior. She undertook to rule him
with a rod of iron from the very start.
The iron burned into his soul, but he
stood it like a martyr. It was always
underetrsod by their acquaintances that
the widow had done most of the love
making before the marriage, but could
not win the Baron until she volunteered
to pay the honeymoon expenses, and
then he surrendered his 4*sart at once.
In after years she reminded him of this.
It was too much for a spirit so proud.
His blood boiled, and one day when his
wife went calling he locked her out of
his house. She sued for divorce and
the Baron did everything possible to
help her secure it.
Speaking of the club and its objects,
Secretary Ward Battles says:
"When we started out we had little
in view but sociability, but we found
such a great field in which to labor that
we decided to advance the welfare of
mankind by dissuading our friends
from getting married.
"We have among our members some
of the best-known men of the city, such
as Stanley Stephenson. James Kellen
berger, Joseph Maristaney, A. Baro
teau, John Fay. B. Steinmetz, Bertram
Hill and a great many others whose
names I cannot recall.
"We never intended that our organ
ization should become known to the
public, believing we could accomplish
more by working secretly. The public
generally look upon such organizations
as ours in the nature of a joke, but we
are serious and sincere in what we hav\
undertaken. We have done a great deal
of good in preventing men from allow
ing love to get the better of them.
Several of our. friends who thought of
getting married have been saved by our
missionaries,, and we do not intend to
allow the -woYk tr> lag."

California City Bachelor Colony
invulnerable to Cupid's
Archery
0 SPINSTERS, pray listen to me.
For you who have grown old
and ugly in the cause of single
blessedness; ' for you who have
spent life's fleeting hours in
meditation fancy free, I have a sur
prise.
I have a surprise.
I have discovered an Eden of Adams
only.
This Eden is a deep-sea harbor on the
Pacific Coast. For one score years and
ten no woman has lived within its sa
cred precincts. Fer thirty years no
child has played upon its beach or lisp
ed an evening prayer.
It is a settlement of the bachelors. It
is a hom<; provided for the bachelors,
and it is a city governed by the bachel
ors.
It is located geographically in the
glorious State of California. Its shores
are washed by the waters of San Fran
cisco Bay.
It is registered on the map as Califor
nia City.
Do you -wish to go there?
If you are strong of limb and long of
breath, try scaling the hills back of
Tiburon until you come to the little
white city in the coveâ then drop down
upon the say Lotharios unawares.
Or if you prefer the Raccoon Straits
in an open boat, and the fates be with
you and the tide, then you may make a
landing the same as the artist I.
There is a universal spirit of defiant
warfare against woman at this set
tlement that bodes Cupid no good. But,
then, much depends.
Diplomatic caution is the only loop
hole of accession to this bachelor king
dom if the visitor be a woman.
The bachelor on guard at the wharf
may be peevish; he may be cynical and
refuse you permission to land just be
cause you arc a woman, and then he
may be the other kind. As I said be
fore, much depends.
There are several varieties of the
species even among the one hundred
who call this place home.
There is the. genial, warm-hearted
fellow who looks you straight in the
eye and at once extends his hand and
says welcome. There is the economical
bachelor who makes you feel that he is
obliged for time and eternity to evade
a woman's smile. There is the Stingy,
greedy and unkempt creature who es
chews manners and even abhors the
use of the obnoxious wood just because
it Is a luxury.
This is the kind who is ever saving
for a rainy day. and it is said that he
spends his holidays counting his gold
and building plans for the future. This
is the kind who can no more be wheed
led, coaxed or coerced into letting you
land than he could be persuaded to
marry, and if I say this specie of bach
elordom be on guard, put to sea; he will
not let you land.
There is the jolly good fellow who
bursts into uncontrollable fits of laugh
ter at the least provocation, he likes
the sound of his own voice and you ir
resistibly join him in the loquacious
gurgle, not because of his wit pure and
sparkling, but because of his Irrepres
sible good nature that beams and bows
at you until you respond. Bachelors
from the bold and defiant to the timid
and shrinking find shelter here.
There are those who skulk along the
wharf and dodge in the first open door
when a woman approaches, and you
may be sure that his eye is glued to
some aperture in the wall where he can
observe you without your knowledge.
If his kind be on guard, then you
may land without protest. He will. see
to it that you do not get near enough
to disturb him.
The coast is yours if you want it
from California City to El Campo.
Bachelors by preference and bachelors
by necessity drift here from all quar
ters of the civilized world, bide for a
time and are gone; but none has ever
been known to enter the field of matri
mony and escape the verdict whose se
vere penalty is ostracism from the
community. Single blessedness is here
a manifesto of inexorable law.
The iron-clad rules that govern a
colony and those that control a bach
elors' club differ widely in their effects.
Mrs. Charlotte Smith of the Woman
Reserve League and her coterie may
work general destruction to rich bach
elors to compel matrimony. By her
time and eloquence she may influence
Congress to impose annual bachelor
fines equivalent to the support of a
family. But the law' that keeps Cupid
at bay in California City is the law
that the civilized bachelor cannot dis
regard and still be a member of the
Eyeless realm.
The man who marries from this com
munity will find his "occupation gono."
"Aye, there's the rub." For in this
port of peace there is but one ulti
matum. The man who commits the
violent crime of matrimony must suf
fer the relentless penalty â banishment.
And what sort of man is proof against
the common wants of bread and but
ter?
Thirty years ago the Pioneer Fish
Warehouse of . the Pacific Coast was
established at this point. Then the
name of California City was applied to
a site further up the bayâ a site whose
foundations crumbled before they were
finished, and so the mythical name de
scended to this fish curing station, and
G. W. Crowell is dubbed the mythical
mayor of the mythical city. In thirty
years every country in the civilized
world has been represented there.
__1^ 'â¢ -
"And why do you employ only un
married men?" I asked Mr. Hough,
who is one of tho bachelor owners of
the fish warehouse.
He winked slyly and said: "Because
they want to be hired."
"But don't the benedicts ever apply?"
"Hardly ever, but â "
"But?"
Mr. Hough thought a moment, looked
wise and replied: "You know, a man
who is unmarrnd has no responsibili
ties .and he is contented to stay with
his work, and â "
'And?"
"Well, most of them are seafaring
men and haven't v domestic inclina
tions."
"Is that your only reason?"
.Now, hear, U bachelor maids: this la
what he said:
"If we had women over there all har
mony would be destroyed; the men
would become dissatisfied and â wellâ .
it wouldn't do; we have had men who
have been married, but â they were
widowers \\hen they came to us."
"And are contented?"
"Just go over ami see."
â¢ â¢ â¢
Our little boat rocked into Bachelors'
Harbor on Wednesday at high tide.
The little white city of mateless men
is not very imposing; the buildings are
small and whitewashed, and into these
scampered several men. They watched
us until we turned to port, then, timid
and tactful, scattered everywhere. But
there was one who stood his ground,
and that one was Alonzo Bates. He
stood on the wharf regarding us with
a cynical smile. His white, neglected
beard, which runs riot over his
weather-beaten face, told more plainly
than registered oaths that a bachelor
he had lived and a bachelor he would
die. He raised a shaking finger and
piped out in his unmistakable Vermont
tone:
"Ye be n't allowed to land here."
This was an unexpected greeting,
which the artist ignored by remarking,
"They're having a big time in the city
to-daYâ celebrating the Fourth and
Dewey."
Oh, lucky speech that opened the
avenues of his pride of nativity!
"I'm right proud of LÂ»ewey," he
drawled out; "he is a Vermonter, too."
The rest was easy. I was famishing
of thirst. Could 1 have a drink of
water ?
"I reckon you'd rather have milk,
wouldn't ye?"
I nodded.
"Then tie your boat and come along."
Mr. Bates is long, spare of build and
slow of speech. He kept his eyes upon
the ground until I asked
"Why did you never marry?"
Then he was visibly agitated and
muttered disdainfully
"Wimin's tarnal fools."
"But did you never find one who
wasn't?"
"Men are tarnal fools, too."
"Oh, are they? When?"
"When they talk to wimin."
And this is what one bachelor thinki
âa bachelor who has sa.ved $30,000 by
rigid economy, and matrimony has not
troubled him for many a year: He
saves his money and patches his
clothes while they are yet new to keep
them from wearing out.
But there are others.
J. C. Caswell is not one of the miserly
kind. He is a spendthrift bachelor. He
is one of the Caswells of Rhode Island
boatbuilding fame and for the past
twenty-five years has built the dories
and repaired the boats at California
City.
"Why don't I marry? 'Cause no one
would have me, I guess. There are no
Mr?. Caudles over here, and I guess we
would make 'em mighty sorry if they
came nosin 01 around now."
And Pietro Piaggi, the bachelor cook,
said: "When I get a fortune I am going
back to the Alpsâ to my home in Switz
erlandâand if the girl I left waits for
me, then perhapsâ but who knows?" i
As for the mythical mayor: "No, I'll
never marry. You see, all of the ladies
are so attractive that I can't make a
choice. I wouldn't even object to pay
a bachelor's fine if the proceeds would
go toward founding an old maids'
home. We are all right without the
ministering angels and sewing circle
small talk. We have three good meals
per day and peace."
Oh. happy community!

PRETTY teeth will do much to
ward redeeming an otherwise
plain and unattractive face.
When a woman is not possessed
of this charm it is frequently
owing to sheer neglect on her part.
I do not mean that the condition of
the teeth depends wholly and entirely
on the care given them, a? many affirm,
for good teeth or bad teeth are gener
ally inherited, and frequently those
that are good to start with give out
entirely before the race is half run,
owing to constitutional weakness or the
use of strong adds as medicine.
If one earnestly wishes fine, beautiful,
white teeth unceasing daily attention
must be bestowed upon them. This care
must begin in childhood, just as soon
as the little baby teeth have pushed
their way through the rosy gums. All
children hate having their teeth
brushed, just as they detest having
their hair yanked and pulled in order to
remove the snarls, or having to sit up,
In a stiff, white pinafore, in the best
parlor when company comes. Who does
not remember the days of childhood
and girlhood, when all sorts of subter
fuges were resorted to to escape clean-
Ing the teeth? No matter how many
threats were held out. or how much
Imploring done on the parts of our
blessed mothers, we just wouldn't
listen, but went <rur way unruffled
and blissfully unconscious of the misery
we were laying up for ourselves later
on.
1 must be of the proper sort and
thoroughly masticated if one does not
wish the teeth tv degenerate. Teeth
were given us for use, and if their mis
is not fully accomplished they will
become weak through lack of work,
and the stomach then being compelled
to finish their work will give out also.
It is an erroneous idea that the first
teeth, because temporary, need little
or no <are. They should be as regu
larly washed and cleaned as those that
come later, and when the little one
reaches th.- age ,>f 2 y--ars a bit of den
tal tloss should be drawn between the
teeth .-very night just before bed time.
This is the time, too, when the teeth
should receive their most thorough
cleansing, for it is at night that fer
mentation takes place, ami all the mis
is wrought. The most assiduous
brushing in the world in the morning
will be of little avail as far as allaying
decay is concerned if this little duty has
l n1: 'glected the night befoi c.
tafci it is that women treat their
teeth to inexcusable abuses, and when
sees a woman crack nuts with her
teeth, or bite thread, or make of her
Ivories an unpatented corkscrew, the
expression "biting ten-penny nails"
does not seem a bit overdrawn.
There is not th-- slightest danger of
us.: th-- teethtoo often. I make
this statement advisedly, for I do not
ihink it at all likely that you will cease
all other occupations ami start in up >n
orv of eternal scrubbmgs, or that the
: â¢ zealous will give her teeth more
than three scrubbings a day, which is
â¢ â¢ uch.
Let your brush be moderately stiff
and not too large. The small brush,
slightly concave, with uneven bristles,
is th<- most efficacious. The teeth should
b<> brushed inside as well as outside, the
!i being not only across th<-> teeth,
but up and down also. Tepid water is
best, as either hot or cold water is apt

to occasion a shock to the enamel which
may result in cracking it.
I>n not use toothpicks to any great
extent, and all dentriflces containing
gritty substances musl be tabooed. Di
luted iisterine makes an excellent wash,
and the mouth should be rinsed with it
the firsi thing upon arising in the morn-
Then brush the teeth well, using
a pure powder, the ingredients of which
you know.
A good one is made by mixing to
gether equal parts of powdered castile
soap, orris root and precipitated chalk.
Or this, which is fragrant and de
lightful:
TOOTH POWDER.
Precipitate chalk, one-fourth pound.
Pulverized castile soap, three-fourth
ounces.
Powdered orris root, one ounce.
Pulverized sugar, one ounce.
Oil of sassafras, one-half dram.
After brushing the teeth, rinse the
mouth well and be sure that your
brush is kept scrupulously clean. When
the sums arc tender and liable to bleed,
a few drops of tincture of myrrh in a
glass of water makes an astringent and
hardening wash.
Never use lemon juice on the teeth.
If they assume a yellowish tinge, a lit
tle peroxide of hydrogen brushed over
them will whiten and cannot possibly
injure them.
< (nee every six months the dentist
should be visited, the teeth thoroughly
examined and small cavities filled. This

Arjswers to Correspor)der)ts.
BELLE â The premature gray hair in
your case is probably hereditary, as
you say you are in excellent health and
have no occasion for worry or anxiety.
The change in color is brought about
almost invariably by the failure of the
mineral ingredients in the pigment. At
the first sign of gray hairs a good iron
tonic, prescribed by a physician, should
be taken regularly, as the failure of the
iron in the pigment usually comes first.
A good tonic should also be applied to
the scalp. Here Is a splendid one: Two
drams tincture of cantharides, six
drams essence of rosemary and
eleven ounces of elderflower water.
Singeing the ends often has a benefi
cial effect on hair that is turning gray.
Roll the hair in small twists, so that
all the tiny ends will bristle out. and
then singe off every split end. Do this
. nee a month, and keep the scalp in a
state of perfect cleanliness.
MARIE HOPELESSâ I cannot guar
antee that by using the ammonia the
little hairs will forever depart, but I
have been told by those who ought to
know that by constant use sued would
be the result. Use the liquid ammonia,
purchased at the drugstore, and apply
it each night.
GERAXiDINE W. â Animation and
good heaith will brighten the eyes bet
ter than anything I know of. Touch
ing the lashes with castor oil will make
them grow. Bathing them in warm
salt water is also good. Blackheads are
best removed by the use of a com
plexion brush, tepid water and oastile
soap. The following shampo.i in lovely
and will make your hair wonderfully
s-f! .".ml glossy: Yelks of two eggs,
beaten to a froth, one ounce spirits of
rosemary and one pint warm \Y,ater.
Put in abottle and shake well. Cleanse
the hair and scalp thoroughly with this
and rinse in several clear waters. If
you prefer a soapy shampoo you will

and will use the orange flower skin food
freely while in the warm climate that
you expect to visit. I am certain that
you will not return with the brown,
wrinkled complexion that your friends
so cheerfully (?) predict for you.
MAREQUITA â The hollow cheeks
can be filled out only by the most
whoiesome diet, the most careful living
an.; a general building up of a depleted
physical system â for few women with
wan, thin faces are really well and
strong. Orris root and . lycopodium is
splendid for perspiring hands; better, I
think than the other preparation you
mention. Wash the hands in hot water
and apply the powder. Prepared chalk,
finely powdered, should be put upc/n the
hands before drawnig on the gloves.
'"Yes" answers your last question.
SALLY S.â Following is the formula
for the orange flower skin food: Sper
maceti, one-half oun<"; refined white
wax, one-half mince; sweet almond oil,
two ounces; lanolin, <-ne ounce; cocoa
nut oil, one ounce; simple tincture of
benzoin, ten drops; orange flower
water, one ounce. The mission of the
skin food Js to plumpen the face and to
obliterate wrinkles. It will refine and
clear the skin beautifully and remove
all roughness and sunburn. Its use, of
course, must- be accompanied by mas
sage. If the ankles are large you
should never wear low shoes.
DOROTHY B.â A good way to invig
orate the hair roots is to gently mas
sage the scalp with the finger tips,
dipped In clear, lukewarm water. This
brings the blood to the surface and re

moves the particles of dead skin. If the
hair is dry rub a little olive oil into the
sralp. Worry, overstudy, ill health or
late hours will cause the hair to fall.
Anything that will give a stronger con
stitution is pretty sure to bring lux
uriant locks. T'se the following tonic:
Eau de cologne, four ounces; tincture
of cantharides, one-half ounce; oil of
lavender, one dram, and oil of rose
mary, one dram. Apply to the roots
with a bit of absorbent cotten once or
twice a day.
MRS. T. â If the spots on your face
come from a disordered liver, first re
move tin- cause of the trouble, and then
apply this mixture at night, washing
away the next morning: Kaolin, four
grams; lanolin, ton grams; carbonate of
magnesia and oxide of zinc, two grams
each. The cucumber milk is excellent.
There is no remedy for whiteheads, ex
cept to puncture each one separately
and press out the contents.
AGONYâ That flabby, puffy condition
about the eyes Is .generally an Indica
tion of some internal trouble, and is
best remedied by removing the trouble
that causes it. Then massage each
night with the orange flower skin food,
formula for which is given in foregoing
reply to Sally S. After the massage
bathe the puffy places in cold water, in
which is a small piece of alum, a piece
the size of a bean being plenty for a
pint of water.
SAL.L.IE RAY â For the red nose and
hands see to it that the clothing is worn
Dose. There must be no tight sleeves or
bands. Then bathe the nose in diluted
witch hazel and apply pure lemon juice
â¢(. thf* red hands, rubbing in a good cold
â ream as soon as the juice Is dry.
A. M. De VEEâ Mount Diablo has
lever, to my knowledge, been in a state
f eruption. It certainly has not been
\ithin the last twenty-five years, nor
:<) I think at any time.
CKESSIDAâ Pure castile soap is fhe
very best in the world. I would not ad
vise the clear cocoa butter for the face,
as it has a slight tendency to make tiny
hairs come. The orange flower skin
food is much better any wa^' for build
ing up the tissues and filling out the
hollow?.'
LOUISE â No wonder you did not
succeed with your cold cream. You
should have stirred it until cold. And
why in the world did you let it boil?
It should merely be heated, so that the
white wax, th^ spermaceti and the oil
of almonds are well melted together.
Then it must be beaten very rapidly
so as to thoroughly mix the oils and
the rose water. You can melt it over
again and get it all right. As vege
table powders will not adhere to your
skin, suppose you try the following,
which is flesh tinted and has a very
pleasant odor: Precipitated chalk, one
OUTFIT FOR
EUROPE
There is a numerous band of tourists
who are going across the Atlantic, and to
them the eternal feminine question of
what to wear with the maximum of com
fort and the minimum of inconvenience is
uppermost.
it is always assumed when one is in a
quandary as to the proper outfit for Euro
in travel that the contemplated .trip ia
:n be a steamer trunk trip, which means
i.iiir distances and short stops. When one
it) going to take the ua'ual tourist voyage,
it couple or three months trip, with one
night and two day stands, it is remark
able with how little in the way of change
Â«,ne can get aiong. Outside wraps for
shipboard and steamer rugs are, of
course, not included in this assertive
statement, for ihe reason that they can
â¢ be left behind witli the steamship com
pany on arrival on the other side, to be
called for or sent as directed.
It is assumed that the steamer trunk
is to contain all one's temporary posses
sions in the way of the wardrobe, and
that one's journey will include Scotland.
Northern Kngland, Northern Ireland and
Germany, whore one is apt to encounter
considerable cool weather, as well as
Swiss valleys. Paris, London and Italyâ
a variety of temperature to cover with a
few articles of clothing.
The most serviceable traveling dress for
such a jaunt is a light weight, close
woven goods, of 'some unshrinkable or al
ready shrunk fabric. Continental coun
tries are proverbial for their uncertainty
of summer showers, and in Scotland every
day nearly sees its rainfall or a thick
mist, so if one does not attend to this
| seemingly unimportant item she may find
] her one gown leaving its prescribed limit
of length without excuse. The traveling
gown should have a close fitting waist
| and filso a silk waist of light, if possible,
washable material. With this and a light
overjacket one is prepared for all emer
gencies.
The shirt waist is a good article to
avoid. Unless freshly laundered it i 3 an

ounce; pure oxide of zinc (best qual
ity), three ounces; carmine, one grain;
oil of rose, two drops. A bit of absorb
ent cotton makes a good powder puff,
although I prefer a piece of soft, white
velvet as a powder rag to everything
else.
CONSTANCEâ If you feel that your
case is hopeless, then fall back on
those nice little corset waists that end
at the hips and have the loose puffed
out busts. It is so difficult to tell some
one whom you have never seen what
colors will best become her. However,
from your description of your coloring,
I should think you could wear dark
blue with a dash of scarlet very nicely,
or rich browns touched with either vio
let or some one of the shades of tan.
S. H. M.â Feet that perspire should
be washed night and morning in warm
water, in which is a little soda. Then
apply this powder: One part salicylic
acid," two parts precipitated chalk and
Beven parts powdered talcum.
J. S.-An offensive breath usually
eo'mes from one of two causes â a dis
ordered digestion or teeth that need a
dentist's attention. If. however, nei
ther one of these is the seat of the
trouble, the following wash will sweet
en the breath: Alcohol, ISS grams; cin
namon, 12 grams; ginger, 2 grams; es
sence of peppermint, 4 grams; cloves,
\<i gram. Mix and leave In infusion for
two weeks in a tightly covered vessel:
then filter through a, covered funnel
and bottle. Put one ieaspoonful to a
glass -of water and rinse the mouth.
Any of the hair tonics given in this de
partment if rubbed into the eyebrows
will make them grow.
GRACE MILLERâ As your hair is
changing color and coming out in such
quantities, ton, I should suggest a gen
eral building up of your physical sys
tem as a remedy. Get a good, pure
tonic and th^n rub olive oil into the
scalp with very gentle massage. Really.
I doubt if you will be able to do away
with the freckles. They seem to be the
natural companions of auburn tresses;
so if I were 7OU, girlie, I'd just let them
severely alone and forget all about
them.
MARGARETâ For the chafing under
the arms, wash with castilp soap and
water, to which a drop or two of car
bolic acid has been added. Then dry

SOD/\ WAJER QIRLS.
Now that the season for the steeling
soda has arrived certain types and traits
of soda-water girls are found together.
For Instance, brunettes take chocolate,
ginger or coffee, just as their country
cousins take sarsaparilla. Golden-haired,
] i r . 5.1. -n china girls take pineapple, lemon
or vanilla, while Titian beauties prefer
raspberry, apricot, cherry or orange
phosphate.
.Demi-blondes, with brown hair, fair
skins and dark eyes, are usually addicted
to mixed llavors. Vanilla and coffee to
gether is subtle and Oriental, while
pistache and lemon suggests butter
flies and apple blossoms, and apricot and
lemon tastes like sweet remorse, or "I
wish I hadn't!" and pineapple and straw
berry recalls La France roses and moon
light tete-a-tetes.
Unimaginative people will exclaim,
"Nonsense!" and drink their vlchy or
chocolate without thinking, but Imagina
tion is half the pleasure of eating and
drinking:.

MRS. G. L. B. â So, you have a cun
ning little baby that insists upon ram
ming its thumb halfway down its
throat i:ir tst every hour in the day.
Dear, dear! these blessed babies cause
their "mom-moms" no end of anxiety
and worry, don't they, and yet what a
lot of happiness and pleasure one gets
out of them, too. The habit of thumb
sucking is sometimes a difficult one to
overcome. It used to- be that putting
a little bitter aloes or tincture of
quassia on the little pink thumb would
bring reform, but these modern babies
are such persistent little creatures that
they simply eat off the bitter stuff and
smack their lips over it, too-. If these
methods fail with your little miscreant,
I wonder how it would do to put little
white cotton gloves on the wee hands?
I really believe that would do it. Sup
pose you try it.
NEW RECRUITâ Am delighted to
welcome you to our ranks; only sorry
that you did not come sooner. The whole
round of health must be attended to.
not only for a dAy, but as the habit of
a lifetime, if one wishes to acquire a
clear complexion. The diet must be
strictly looked after, exercise must be
regularly taken, the daily sponge bath
upon rising in the morning must not be
neglected for a single day. and the
room in which one sleeps must be
thoroughly ventilated. As for the face
itself, I advise a thorough scrubbing
with a complexion brush, tepid water
and castile soap every night just be
fore retiring, followed by a smearin"
with the orange flowpr skin food or any
good cold cream. Let this remain on
the skin a few minutes and then re
move every vestige of grease with a
soft cloth. It will not be necessary to
wash the face again the following
morning â merely wipe it off with a
damp cloth and then dust with some
harmless powder. If you will follow
these simple rules I feel more than
certain that you will see a marked
change in your complexioft in a very
short time." The following cream you
will find delightful. It will give your
skin that transparent look for which
you are striving.
ALMOND CREAM.
Oil of sweet almonds, two and a half
ounces.

MME. HYGEIA.
A BICYCLE
SERVICE
Fyfield is three miles north of Ongar,
and is one of the prettiest spots In all
Essex. The rectorâ the Rev. L. Elwyn
Lewisâ invited cyclists in general for a
special service, which was to be all over
In half an hour. To insure their comfort
he offered to provide tea at sixpence a
head, and to allow the cyclists to stroll
through his ground." and smoke or lie on
the Â«rass before returning home.
The day was a signal success. There
has probably never been a boiler church
parade. At least five hundred cyclists at
tended. The Epping- road was alive with
them. Nearly every club and every
suburb of London was. represented; others
went from < "helmsi'ord and Dunmow,
where the flitch conns from. The cay
was beautifulâ a bright sun, a light
breeze, a clear blue sky and the fragrance
of 'summer in the air.
Every variety of cycle was to be seen
and every variety of cycling attire. There
was a motor tricycle and there was a
lady in rationnl.s. As the Whitsuntide
decorations were still in place the rustic
church was very -bright and pretty. The
wheelmen wore too many for the accom
modation. They packed every seat and
overflowed into the church yard.
It was a simple little serviceâ a few
hymns, a few prayers, a lesson, and a.
sermon five minutes long. The preacher
developed a single Ideaâ as the cycle
requires the spirit of man to guide
It. so does man require the spirit of
God; as the cycle is a means of
progress through this world, so Is the
gruce of God the means of progress to
ward the world to come. And the rectorâ
wise manâ fulfilled his contract. As the
clock struck 4 the "Amen!" of the last
hymn was said.
Then tea in the parish room, consumed
with open air appetites, and after that a
smoke beneath the rector's chestnuts. The
rector is a vicar as well, and he has both
a rectory and a vicarage. This rectory,
a rambling and picturesque old mansion.
was once the manor house, and he has
seven acres of ground .around It. Pho
tographers perpetuated the scene, and all
the viilage came out to see. There has
never been su.-h a busy Sunday at Fy
iield.â London Daily Mail.

GLIMPSES
DEL MONTE. July 7.-"This is ;
the first American place I have ;
seen in America." The speaker
II looked up and down the broad
C y piazza of the huge wooden hotel. i
"How so?" asked his compan- ;
ion. :
"Well," said the Englishman, "I got '
here too late for dinner, don't you know,
and when I went to the dining-room they >
gave meâ what do you beefsteak,
potato chips and ice water; the first real
ly American meal I have eaten. And now ,
thisâ so American!"
The Briton again looked up and down
the long porch, thickly set with rocking
chairs, where white forms swayed to and
fro in the moonlight that flickered through
the leafage of shadowing trees. From the .
ballroom floated the strains of a waltz;
in front bicycles carrying slender white ,
figures glided noiselessly past, and groups
of girls, white clad, bareheaded, strolled
up and down.
"I # suppose," he said tentatively, glanc
ing at the rocKing figures, . from whose
hair or corsage an occasional gleam of
light woke the answering spark of dia
monds,- "that these ladies, out here are
chaperons whose daughters are dancing
Inside?" '.^yJX
"Very possibly," returned his compan
ion. â¢vv: v; ~.v.
â¢The Briton gazed silently a few minutes
into the garden, where other young girls,
their arms twined about one another, con
tinued to pass, bare-armed, heads uncov
ered, lifting with their unoccupied hands
the skirts of costly evening gowns. With
an air of satisfaction he presently repeat
ed. "So American!"
And almost the Briton was right. Del
Monte, with its huge wooden caravansary,
many-windowed? containing hundreds of
roome, where people swarm like bees in a
hive, eating together, dancing together in
the hotel parlors in the evening, lounging
together on the hotel piazzas day and
evening, is far more American in its os
tentation of wealth and drees, and its
unequaled frankness and good humor and
jovial democracy in display than is New
port â that enormous, and brilliant Euro
pean garden, beautiful and stately, but
bo walled and fenced that the townspeo
ple are barricaded even from access to a
beach which from the days of the first
settlement has been their own.
There is very little privacy at Del
Monte. There is no partition through
which one cannot hear. Ten minutes ago
there appeared on my threshold a couple
of children, boy and girl. 9 and 11 years
old possibly, of the progress of whose
toilet as performed in the next room my
ears had for some minutes kept me In
formed. Both were spotless in white
pique, but where the boy glanced at me
with a certain timidity, the girl advanced
boldly, her little round neck lying in
creases of fat, her round brown eyes sur
veying me with audacious curiosity.
"When did you come and how long are
you going to stay?" she asked; then
turned to examine the room before join
ing her mother, a rather young, hand
same woman, with audacious eyes like
the child's, who paused at the door on
her way down to the piazza.
A white taffeta dress was this lady s
porch toilet, with an elaborate effect of
lace in the make-up, and an accordion
plaited sash of pale blue chiffon. A dainty
fichu also of blue chiffon, carried down
with much frilling of lace to a point at
the waist, gave a decided slope to her
shoulders. As she lifted her skirt, I saw
that she wore small white shoes with
blue bows and Louis XV heels. In her
ears were diamonds, and the hands that
held some brilliant trifle of fancy work in
vivid cherry color were covered with
rings. It was like no place but Del Monte
that, smiling to see that the children nad
found amusement, this stranger expressed
no surprise at their tanlng possession of
my apartment.
White was the color of the porch col
ony; white lawn dresses, white piques,
white ducks, white cloth gowns, white
veilings, white dotted Swiss frocks, white
point d'esprits, white book muslins made
of the porch a harmony in white.
Next to white dresses and jewelry the
impressive features of Del Monte are its
large womenâ stout women, 1 mean, of
whom it has more than any other resort
â who promenade the parks and gardens
of the springs, and whose effect in their
white robes is that of snow-clad moun
tains.
All-pink hats are favorite wear with
the all-white dresses, and trying they are
except to the loveliest faces and . most
perfect complexions. "Crowned with
roses"â Brobdignagian rosesâ are many of
the Del Monte girls one meets â for in
spite of the large women there are girls
at Del Monteâ though some of them are
too sallow and some too ruddy to bear
without harm the flowers' proximity. But
now and then one sees a beautiful young
face that looks adorable under its rose
laden headgear, and for the sake of one
such unalloyed success all failures are
freely forgiven.
Duck and pique . skirts dot the fields,
embroidered with fleur de lis and Frenchy
looking bow-knots, for Del Monte has
never resigned itself to being severely
tailor-made. Here goes a girl in scarlet
pique, and there one in blue, but these
are the punctuation marks, the tabasco
sauce; they give variety i and emphasis,
but the 'skirt of skirts is white, trimmed
perhaps with strapped seams in some
vivid color.
With the white skirt a white waist
may be worn in lawn or pique, or per
haps one of sheer, pale blue batiste or
something heavier in blue pique. There
may be, too, a pique jacket, but the spe
cialty of Del Monte is the silk golfing
jacket, shaped like an Eton, of white or
some delicate color and so embroidered
and decorated as to make clear the fact
that, with exceptions, the Del Monte girl
scarcely goes in for "the rigor of the
game." Of course the experienced golf
girl scorns, for purposes of play, a white
taffeta jacket embroidered with thistles
in their natural colors, but at golf
luncheons or at a fete champetre even
she may relent, while in the eyes of the
girl to whom athletics are of secondary
importance, the jacket is a mitigating
circumstance.
There are Del Monte girls who are not
fluffy or white. A smart costume was of
large plaids of lavender and white pique,
worn with a little black, silk Eton jacket
turned over with white and opening upon
a mannish white vest and tall collar. Tho
owner of this costume still stepped in low
heeled bulldog-toed shoes, where the fluffy
girl is wearing high neels and pointed toe 3
altogether.
And the most stunning girl at Del
â¢Monte, straight-nosed but of an English
rather than a Greek type of beauty, wears
dresses that, soft as the fluffy girl's, are
as severely patterned as the tailor made.
Beautiful embroideries are the stunning
girl's hobby, embroidered on cloth, on
veiling, on muslins. Other of her suc
cesses are achieved with hats, large hats
adorned some with plumes and some with
giant roses. One of the pink hats of
which I have spoken is hers, of white
Italian straw and trimmed with pink and
white comet ribbon and pink and white
paradise feathers drooping about the
face on each side.
In evening dresses there are dreams, for
dancing is the oifder of the night, and
every girl who comes brings her trunks
full of laces and muslins. White India
muslin is one of the summer's favorite:?,
dotted with incrustations of lace and
made with the inevitable circular flounce.
A recent success was a gown of white
point d'eaprlt veiled by a tunic of flne
black lace. Mauve chiffon trimmed with
lilacs offered a touch of variety.
â¢ * *
Among the lesser things fashionable,
but mighty in importance, are the buttons
which are now in evidence upon whatever
manner of gown. The new glass buttons
are singularly beautiful.. They are plain
or cut. and appear in every possible shade,
light or richly toned, in blues and vio
lets, pinks and greens, so much liked.
They are used even on muslin, organdies*
or lace, frocks, especially for the long po
lonaises, and are used all the way down
the frontâ the back, as the case may
be. The heart shape is much liked at
present, and comes in pearl or glass. For
lace coats and redingotes the buttons are
a decided feature. Frequently for such
use they are of glass overlaid with gold
filigree or of very handsome pearl.
Speaking of colored glassâ it will be seen
that it forms the handles of the smart
wash parasols, which the tailors build to
order to match the duck, pique or linen
gowns they turn out in such smart per
fection. . These parasols are. by the way.
most fashionable when of five instead of
seven gores. Very smart, too. even for
young women this season are the tiny
second empire carriage parasols, all ruf
fled and laoWlke in effect.
Among small novelties -we learn that In
Paris the long neck chain is now prefer
ably of polished iron. Indeed, iron is a
much favored fad for many of the little
trinkets of the toilet. '
In the fichus line there are elaborate
ones of ribbons and lace, but the plain
soft ones of chiffon are the ones that take
best. They are really the most attractiva
and becoming.
To be worn with delicately tinted shirt
waists, of either cotton or silk, there ara
long chiffon or silk mus'.in scarfs that
go about the neck twice and tie in a larga
bow under the chin. There are two little
frills edged with narrow satin ribbon on
each end of the tie.
Another fetching neck arrangement is
a collar of rose linen edged in lace. At
the front there is a knot of hla<jk velvet
ribbon, caught up by a gold buckle, and
white tulle dotted in black chenille.
A novel cravat of black velvet seems to
,be the winning favor.
Two other sketches show ties that are
much worn with white pique shirtwaists.
These- are made of the brightest of figured
silks, which resemble the familiar ban
dana handkerchiefs in design. One such
collar has a stock of red silk. In front
and caught by a band of red silk there i 9
a square of the figured silk drawn up in
the middle. Another gay silk tie is in the
form of a four-in-hand.
The Panama hats that are sold by one
or two of the leading hatters in the city
are very popular at the resorts. These
are worn with India silk gowns, as well
as with wash gowns. They are trimmed
becomingly only with bows of black velvet
ribbon and one or two little stiff black
wings. In shape they are not unlike the
sailor hats, but the brim curls, up and is
soft. These hats are, of course, expen
sive, but they are said to wear well and
to clean, and. so far as the straw goes,
are in every respect like the Panama hats
that men used to wear years ago. and
that were supposed to last ten years. It
is, however, only a passing fancy, and it
is foolish to invest too much money in
anything of the kind, although, where
economy does not have to come into the
question, it is well to include one such hat
among the others that are bought for the
summer campaign.
RAREST STAMP
The question is often asked. What is the
rarest stamp among the issues of the
United States? The highest price ever
paid for a single specimen of this country
was $4400, which sum was given for the
famous 10-cent stamp of Baltimore, is
sued by the Postmaster of that city in
1545. The design shows the autograph of
President Buchanan, with the value be
low. There are but few copies in ex
istence, and It may truly be said that it
is the rarest and most valuable postago
stamp in America.
Prior to the sale of this celebrated
specimen the highest price paid was $3000.
This was for a fine copy of the 20-cent
"St. Louis," which at that time ranked
as one of the rarest American stamps.
Shortly after it was sold, however, others
were "found, and the price has dropped
considerably.
There are a great many United States
stamps ranging 1 in value from $500 to
fj*>fi. among which are the Beaumont,
Uniontown and Madison (Confederate)
Ttje Girl Wrjo Goes to the Races.
Provisionals, and the Brattleboro. Mill
bury and New Haven Postmasters'
stamps, all of which are extremely
Bcarce. Such rarities as these are seldom
offered for sale, and when by chance one
of them comes upon the market there, are
always many collectors ready and willing
to pay full value for it.
In the way of finding rare stamps there
are great possibilities for those who have
access to old letters and correspondence
between the years 184.3 and 1565. The early
Postmasters' Provisionals w^re issued in
IMS, IS4S and 1547, and the rare Confederate
stamps in 1863. Besides these there aro
many old issues of regular United States
stamps that are rare, and bring good
prices when sold.
The most valuable stamps in the world
are the first issues of the Island of Mau
ritius, a smalt British possession off tho
coast of Africa. Although bet we. n
twenty and thirty are known, the last sold
brought more than SSOOO when of
fered In Paris about :i year ago.

That was the experience of Jake
Aklrlch a few days ago, and he
. says that It Is the tightest box he
ever got Into, and he has been in
a good many. Jake is a prospector who
for over a year has been working out
in the mountains a few miles from Dia
mond Springs, El Dorado County. Near
where Jake has been working is an aban
doned engine boiler, with all the machin
ery including the boiler. The house tha
enclosed the machinery has all bee
blown down, so that the boiler stand
out in the open air. The boiler is on
of the old-fashioned kind without flue?.
Early in the year it stmrk Jake tha
this boiler would be a pretty good plac

perfectly impervious to the heavy rain
that fall in the vicinity. So he took ou

Jake went to bed at his usual time

open.
He went to sleep instantly, but some
hours later was awakened by a queer
sound at the end of the boiler. Rising
in his blankets Jnke reached for his min

he was for a moment blinded by the glare.
Then it flickered and went out.

far end of the boiler. Then he got fright

He felt here and there, all the time con

way. Cold sweat came out all over him
and a frenzy seized him. He wanted to
make a rush for the manhole, but fear

Then he felt for his matches again, and

in America who could not profit by
studying the methods of Morgan. He
is absolutely natural; he seems to
know nothing about the ancient and
dishonorable tricks of stagecraft. He
expresses the emotions as a full-blood
ed you or I would In similar circum
stances In real life. His .reserve and
powers of suggestion are almost as
potent as those of William Gillette;
hla temperament Is warmly magnetic,
ready for any Intense moment and
never exposing Its limitations.
The more I see of Morgan the more
am I convinced that he Is one of the
big actors of our time. Given the good
health that I hear Is now denied him.

ASHTON STEVENS.
Columbia.
San Francisco will be the second city
', in this country to have the opportunity tn
: pass judgment upon the comedy "Lord
and Lady Algy," the play that hoi. is a
record of an entire season at the Empire
Theater, New York, and a run of over
tight, months In London. Charles Froh
nian will present Henry Miller and the
i special company now at the Columbia
i Theater- in the ('urton piece on Monday
[ night and it is promised that the play
i will be given an unusually elaborate
staging.
The story of the play is as follows:
Lord and Lady Algernon <"hetland have
i separated, partly from want of money,
and partly from incompatibility of tastes.
i She has gone to live with her aunt, and he
dwells In the flat. While Lord Algy in
I thus situated, his elder brother, the Mar
quis of Quarmby, prevails on him to
lend his rooms for a meeting with a lady
whose name is not mentioned. Meanwhile
! Brabason Tudway. a wealthy hone boiler
i with social ambitions. Implores Algy to
attend a fancy dress ball, which is to be
given at Tudway's house In Mayfair,
while the proprietor is away in the. coun
i try on business, and remonstrates with
| Mrs. Tudway on her giddiness and general
! indifference to the proprietor. Now, it la
precisely this Mrs. Tudway with whom
I the Marquis is to have the meeting. Algy
goes to the ball, dressed as the great Duke
of Marlborough, but unfortunately gets
tipsy before hr> arrives there. Tudway,
pom'chow or other, conceives the Idea that
it is Algy who has fascinated Mrs.
! Tudway, and Instead of going into the
country the bone boiler repairs to the ball

tume of a highwayman. Algy's muddle
headed attempts to say a few admunitory
words to Mrs. Tudway are taken by the
is husband for affectionate atten
tlons, and he orders Lord Algy to leave
the house. A scene ensues, In which Lady
Algernon figures prominently and Lord
Aigy is conducted to a cab rind sent home.
The last act takes place at Lord Alger
non's flat. Hither comes Mrs. Tudway.
Lord Algy, by a half-humorous exhorta
tion, persuades her to abandon her inten
tlon of elopement ami to return to her
husband. Tudway arrives before she can
get out of the house, and it becomes nec
essarj to conceal her. The bone boiler
feels certain tha v t his wife is on the prem
ises, and makes a fuss. The Marquis ar
dressed for travel, and adds to the
complications. Lord Algy does not know
whai to do. He does not wish either to
betray his brother or to expose the lady.
Tudway insists upon making a Fearch,
and In the midst of the struggle which
- between him and Lord Algy, Lady
â \ln.v arrives. The situation ends In a sat
iry explanation and the happy re
conciliation of Lord andJLiady Algy.

The Lambardi Opera Company.
It is said that the two performances
to be given by the Lambardi Opera
Company at the California Theater to
morrow (Monday) and Tuesday nights
will positively and emphatically be the
last that this excellent organization
will ever give in San Francisco. Ar
rangements have been made for a long
season in Los Angeles, prior to their
return to Italy, and they leave directly
for that city following their "farewell"
here. For the two nights at the Cali
fornia, Manager Prledlander has se
lected the two best operas in their rep
ertoire, and for the reason that many
requests have come to him, for a repe
tition of both these operas. On Monday
night "Mignon" will be given, and on
Tuesday night "The Barber of Selville."
On both nights all the great principals
will be in the casts, including the art
ists, Uepettn, Sosjtegni, Ferrari, Bada
racco, Rubso, Bugamelli, Barducci and
the others, who have made such hits
since their singing in San Francisco.
The orchestra will be augmented and
every member of the company will as-
Fist to make the last two performances
memorable ones in the history of
the Lambardis' engagement. Popular
prices will prevail on this occasion.
That the singers will have ovations
goes without saying. No organization
that hag ever visited San Francisco has
sung operas so true and perfect as the
Lambardis.
Blanche Bates and The Frawley Co.
There have been many Pan Francisco
actressos, but th^re has never been but
one Blanche Bates; we have had any
number of stock companies, but none
that has ever enjoyed the popularity of
the Frawley combination.
The Frawley company and Blanche
Bates were considered as much a part
of San Francisco as the City Hall, and
ten times as entertaining- Consequent
ly when last November they quietly
folded their tents and stole away to
the East San Francisco was for a time
inconsolable.
But when one day there flashed ove>
the wires the glowing accounts of the
way San Francisco's beautiful favorite
had taken New York by storm, the
people of this city forgot their disap
pointment in the pride with which they
listened to the successes that were fall
ing to the lot of the talented woman
who in her genius and charming per
sonality was doing so much to extend
the fame of their fair State.
The people at home were consoled for
their loss and patiently awaited the
time when she would once more return
to her own and delight them as she
did in days of yore. Miss Bates was
as anxious to return as the people
were to have her back, and when an
opportunity to play a five weeks' en
gagement in this rity presented itself
sue grained it with eagerness.
She will arrive here on Wednesday
next and on Thursday evening will
open at the California with Mr. F"raw
ley in their most famous play, "The
Last Word."
Following this will come their othe*
New York hits, or at least as many
of them as can he wedged In the flyÂ»
weeks for which the company la
booked.
The company Frawley Is bringing out
with him consists of over thirty well
known people, among whom are such
stars as Hope Rons. Mac Dohrman.
Manola Mould. Augustus Cook, Charles
W. King and Frank Mathieu.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, July B.â The character of -trad-
Ing In stocks was much confused throughout
to-day's short session of the exchange. There ;
v.ere points of aggressive strength which en
couraged maintenance of prices, but the cer
tainty of an unfavorable bank statement en
couraged the continuance of profit-taking In
pome of the stocks which have recently ad
vanced several points in price. On the .publi
cation of the bank statement the whole mar
ket sold off arid net gains were preserved in
only a few cases. The liquidation was by no j
means heavy and the bears covered short con
tracts at the decline, causing a rally from the
low point. The denials of the reported alli
ance between Pennsylvania and New York
Central led to declines in those stocks, but the
amount was remarkably small. The bank
etatement on Its face presented an extraordin- |
ary condition of affairs. It Is almost unprece- 'â 
dented to have the cash reserves down to with- |
in a little over $5,000,000 01 the 2."> per cent re
quired by law at this time of year.- Yet the
banks expanded their loans during the week |
nearly $7,000,000 when they were already at j
the highest ligure vn record last week. The |
conclusion is unavoidable that the banking i
authorities see prompt relief in certain pros- |
pects. In fact, the easing of money during the i
latter part of the week shows that the re- !
lief is already at hand. It comes in large
part from the release of funds that had been ;
accumulated for the disbursement of semi-an
nual dividends. It. is also taken into consider
ation that Interior points are better supplied I
â with money than ever before, so that the con- I
Victlon is held In banking circles that tight- |
ne-.- in the New York money market â¢ would j
bring funds from interior points to New York-, j
Th- action of the stock market this week has ;
Justified the confidence of those who bought j
securities last week in the rieilef that oppor- \
tunity would be offered to realize profits quick- !
ly. The expected demand for' stocks was forth- I
coming, but it was so freely fed with* offer- I
Ings accumulated last week that the strength- i
ening effect on prices was offset and the tide â 
turned in favor of reaction. Thus in spite of a
Very active market tor the short week after
th' long holiday period, the net changes are
not conspicuous in the majority of cases.
The pruttt taking was most effective early in
the week in Pennsylvania and New York Gen- !
tral and the Vanderbilts. Selling was not |
heavy in either of these, but the large and con
fident buying of last week was discontinued
and prices were not supported. Much stress Is
laid on the large amount of the year's earnings
that have been reinvested in railroad prop- '
erties, resulting in higher efficiency and paving j
the way for future reductions in the ratio of '
operating expenses. There were incidents cor
roborative of the earlier rumors of far-reaching
combinations of control of railroad systems,
calculated to make possible more economical
administration and to facilitate co-operative
measures for conducting traffic. But. In spite
of these factors of strength in the" general out- j
look the tendency toward reaction in the rail- ;
ways prevailed on account of the recent condi
tions. Profit taking was the main factor, but
there was in addition some apprehension that
spring wheat had been damaged by heavy
ra.inÂ« and there were heavy damages to rail
road properties by the Texas Hoods. The most
potent influence toward reactions was the fail- i
ure of the money market to weaken as ex
pected under the distribution of half-yearly in
terest and dividend disbursements. Time money
could readily be had at 'SdjZM per cent, but
call loans were slow to yield below 6 per cent.
In London both call money and the discount
rate fell below 2 per cent, reflecting the re
laxation of pressure for the half-yearly settle
ment. Enormous loans were liquidated both
at the Bank of England and the Hank of
France. The strain on the money market In
Berlin and Vienna was not so much relieved,
exchanges continuing to run against London. !
But confidence was shown that the stringency i
there would also relax soon and that no further
demand would be made on New York for gold.
The easier money conditions in London brought
large buying of stocks in New York for Lon
don account, until money rates there began to
harden again.
The week's trading on the Stock Exchange
has been distinguished by some reawakening
of Interest in industrial Issues, as the market
for railroad stocks fell into dullness on the
reaction. The older dividend-paying industrials
have bcÂ«>n favorites, but some of the newer ore '
and metal combinations have also shown signs
of life, notably the coppers. Amalgamated
Copper has moved up several points in the out
side market, but is still well below the orig
inal subscription price, and Anaconda has been
active and strong.
Bonds have .shown Increased activity and
strength.

NEW YORK'S FINANCIAL CONDITION.
NEW YORK, July The Financier Bays: j
I The associated banks of New York, if their
I statement for the week ending July 8 Is to
[ be accepted as correct, have less surplus cash
on hand than at any time (with the exception
of September, 1896) since the 1893 panic. But
I the current exhibit is so complicated by inci
dents due to July disbursements and also by
1 the system of averages employed In making it
: that its totals would not possess the significance
that otherwise might attach to them. The loss of
I about $10,000,000 in cash, for Instance, is very
I much more than known operations called for,
I and the expansion of nearly $7,000,000 in loans
must reflect previous weeks' business. The
demands for accommodation within the past
two days certainly did not necessitate this vio
! lent rife. As the statement stands it plainly
I indicates that every dollar of the loans has been
1 taken from the banks in cash, and withdrawal
I of deposits has been a similar operation. Mani-
I festly this is an impossible contingency. A more
â¢ detailed explanation shows that of the loss In
cash the National City and the Chase National
banks are responsible for the entire reduction,
the National City's loss having been about
I $6,000,000, and Its increase in loans more than
$6,000,000.
It is interesting to note In this connection
1 that whereas the average reserve of all the
j banks is now 25.5 per cent, a lose of 1 per cent.
1 the reserve, exclusive of the Institution
j named, is 26 per cent. In other wordd,
i sixty-two of the sixty-three banks have
I within a small fraction of 1 per
! cent of as much money as reported at the open-
I ing of July. The refusal of call money to ad
vance perceptibly In the face of the showing
made by the banks proved that the situation
is pretty well understood, and that no fears
: are entertained as to the future. During the
next week the banks will gain heavily in cash.
i not only on Government account, but from
I other sources as well. It is perhaps no exag
j geration to say that at the close of business
; Saturday the various Institutions were in much
I better shape in every way than their statements
would Imply. The maintenance of a 4 per cent
rate on call money is of itself enoueh to mi
i duce a movement of currency in this direction.

HAY AND FEEDSTUFFS.
The Hay market is deceiving everybody. It
is doing Just what nobody expected it would a
month BEO. In the first place, receipts are
light. Secondly, the usual summer demand has
not appeared. Thirdly, prices have neither ad
vanced nor declined. In brief, the market is as
quiet as a millpond, and nobody can tell what
It Is going to do. Old Hay is no longer quot-

BEANS AND SEEDS.
Beans have again advanced under a good de

that the -Eastern crop Is not looking well, and

There seems to be less glut in Peaches, though I
there are plenty here. Plums are piled up high,
and by the way they are coming in are likely
to stay piled. At the same time they are bring- i
ing fine prices in the East. Pears are making
rather more show, and there is no scarcity In
Apples. Grapes are still in light supply. Nec
tarines are coming in. Melons are selling better
at lower prices. A crate of Watermelons from

Buyers have done some nlbblVng at new

A MOST DANGEROUS INSECT.
So Says Professor pucr;s, Curator of Entomology of the California
Academy of Sciences.
THE Menalolestes picipes is one of the most dangerous insects m the whole Pacific slope. It is a
great torment to all workers in orchards and often inflicts fatal wounds. Every year hundreds
of farm hands are bittei and I have known several to receive a number of bites on the backs of
their necks in the same forenoon. The species that causes the most trouble is commonly found
beneath stones and rubbish, although when they become plentiful they are found on trees and bushes.
Any person bitten should apply ammonia at once and the danger will be reduced to a minimum. It
would be a good idea for people living in the country to keep a supply of ammonia on hand all the time.
People whose blood is not in the best of condition have the most to fear.

While sitting in his study one day last

against the walls and draperies, and in
revenge for its unwarranted attack lipon

that had done all the mischief and was to
blame for all the unlovely faces and pain

not phase him in the least. Instead of
that, it seemed rather to increase his am

tern summer hotel keepers, both at
aside and In the mountains, are on
the verge of despair, as it is feared that
the creature, which flourishes equally well
In either environment, may invade their
domains and frighten away timid guests.
The Government entomologists encour
y assure us that the Menalolestes
means no harm; that he is by no
means vicious, but that his habit of prob
ing everything with which he comes in
. ct with his sharp-pointed beak leads
him into unintentional mischief, the bacte
rial poison which he accumulates on his

this view of the question and declare that
the hug stings and stings purposely, and
simply because he wants to, and that he
maliciously injects poison of his own con
coction into every puncture which he
makes. Be this as it may, the fact re
mains th:tt .It is just as painful to be
poisoned accidentally as to be stuns pur
posely, and also just as dangerous. A
boy in New Y->rk has ili<>d from the effects
of one of those insects' seemingly inslg
niflcant wounds, and even the California
Menalolestes has awakened from his past
lethargy and put himself on record along
with his Eastern brother by killing a
poor little playful San Jose kitten.
Under these circumstances one can but
ask again, Are we to have an epidemic
of bug-stings?
THE BUG AS
VIEWED BY
SCIENCE.
INCE the reports from the East
V^. about the fatal, ravages of the so-
V) called "kissing bug." California
Km/ scientists have turned their atten-
A. tion to a renewed study of the in-
seel pesi as it exists here. Califor
nita has long been known as a favorite
resort of the insect in question, although
there have been remarkably few casual -
This, however, may be due to the
fact that this part of the country is not
so thickly settled as the eastern portion.
Professor Fuchs, entomologist of the
California Academy of Sciences, has just
made a search through his collection and
found but one specimen of. the species that
do< 9 all the damage.
"This bug is known as the Menalolestes
p] p< Â»," said Professor Fuchs, as ho
pinned the three-eighths-inch long speci
men up in Croni of the microscopic ram
era to be photographed for The Call.
Then, by a delicate touch by a
pair of tiny tweezers, he twisted and

pulled the legs about in all directions,
gave firm tugs to the feelers and pushed
the head here and there until Mr. Menalo
leste* looked as natural as life and as if
just ready to start off to find somebody
to poke his stinger into.
"That is the position he takes when he
crawls," said the professor, as he contem
plated his work. "Now, this Insect Is a
true bug. He has a large number of rela
tives. In fact his family is one of the
largest In the Insect kingdom.
"This goes under the general name of
Reduvloidea. The- mem ers of this family
are both herbaceous and carnivorous. They
feed on the juices of plants and fruit and
on other insects. They will even become
cannibals should necessity drive them to
it.
"Their particular feed, however, is the
caterpillar. They drive their beaks into
one of the crawling insects and simply
suck it to death by removing every drop
of Its blood.
"No part of this country is exempt
from the ravages of these Insects. There
are two distinct species found in Califor
nla -the Menalolestes picipes and the
Menalolestes ai/dominalis. The latter,
however, does not appear to have ever
been caught in the act of stinging, al
though there Is little doubt but that It
could be as poisonous as the other. Thera
is very little difference between them, ex
cept In the color of the wings. In this re
gard the insect belongs to the species
known as Heteropterous Hemipetra.
"As far as 1 have been able to discover
the Menalolestes picipes makes its home
under stones, falien logs and the bark of
rotten trees. A rubbish heap is a good
place to look for them.
"The habits of the insect place it among
the swift runners, it is very hard to
catch them in the day time and at night
they fly, but of this there is a good deal
yet to be studied, as there is about all
nocturnal Insects. This one is a terror in
more ways than one and I count it as
one of the most dangerous insvcls on the
who!e Pacific Slope.
"The calling of the Menalolestes picipes
the 'kissing bug' is surf ly not right. The
HYSTERIA IN ANIMALS.
That animals are subject to attacks of
hysteria ie a discovery only lately made
by physicians. Tet the two cases re
corded in the Neurologisches Centralblatt
by Dr. H. Higler seem to leave no doubt
about the matter.
The animals that were affected were a
cat and a canary respectively. The cat,
â which was nine months old, 'healthy and
active, was one day deeply bitten in the
back by a dog and immediately fell down
paralyzed. When Dr. Higier first saw It
five or six weeks after the Injury, it
walked only with its fore paws, dragging
its body and hind limbs. There was com
plete loss of sensation In the hind paws
and in the hinder third of the body, both
sides of the abdomen and puck of the
animal being Indifferent to deep punctures
with a needle and to hot applications, but
it always responded ti> gentle touching of
the front half of the body. The tail wan
paralyzed, but none of the limbs atro
phied, as is usual in such cases.
Dr. Higi^r considered that tho cat w.-is
suffering from an inflammation of the
spinal cord, but what occasioned him sur
prise was the fact that the animal gave
no positive signs other than the paralysis.
One day the servant girl, being curious
to see whether the. cat would fall on all
fours, as cats usually do. threw it from
the first floor of the house on to the pave
ment. As a matter of fact, it alighted on
all fours. Immediately ran away and was,
contrary to expectation, completely cured
of its sensory and motor paralysis, which
had lasted for more than two months.
The cat, therefore, really had no lesion
of tli<- spinal cord at all and all its symp
toms were due to the fright experienced
by the bite of the dog. Lji other words.
the cat was manifestly suffering from an
attack of hysteria.
Dr. FJlgler'a second case showed itself
in a canary whose cage, with the bird in
it, waH pulled down from the wall by a
cat. but Dr. Hlgier interposed before the
cat seized it. Tlv- bird lay on the bottom
of the cage, stiff as if dead, but was re
vived by sprinkling with cold water, after
which it was lively, took its food well
and showen no abnormality except that
from having been a fine singer it became
silent.
For six w.-f-ks the bird never uttered a
n"'<'. then this condition passed < >fr" quite
unexpectedly <nd tin- â â¢anary once mnrc
very well. Dr. Hirier.also refers
to shr<->e cases mentioned by i>r. Tou
rette In wliich dogs showed hysterical
symptoms.

SO DEADLY.
fact that people have, been bitten on the
lips with fatal results denotes nothing,
because the bug will bite, or sting, into
any part of a human being that it comes
into contact with. Of course it is only
natural, considering that the insect does
most of its prowling ai night, that it
should fly against people's faces, as that
is the only portion of the body that is un
covered.
"Of my own experience, I have never
known death to ensue as the result of the
bite of the Menalolestes picipes. But I
have heard of a number of fatal cases
and have no doubt that the report was
reliable.
"The worst that I ever knew that hap
pened in California was in an orchard not
far from this city. A farm hand was out
trimming trees. It was early In March
and the day was quite warm.
'â¢Suddenly the man gave a yell and put
his hand up to the back of his neck.
Everybody crowded around and looked at
the place the man indicated, but could see
nothing.
"We all thought at first that it was a
spider that had bitten the man, but he
soon gave another yell and said he had
been bitten again further down the back.
Turning down his collar, we found the
inject that had done the business.
"By this time the first bite had com
menced to swell and become very red.
The man groaned in agony, but we were
powerless to do anything except hurry
him "ff to a doctor.
â¢â¢This naturally took some time, and the
man was in pretty bad condition when
help came to him. For hours the doctor
was unable to afford the least relief and
the man suffered agonies.
"It was several days before the poor
fellow was out of danger, and he needed
the constant attention .of the doctor. At
one time his neck swelled up to nearly
â w ee the natural size and he was a most
awful-looking object. Convalescence was
slow but he finally pulled through and
the doctor said it was about as close a
aye as he ever met with in his practice.
â¢'1 have known of numerous other cases
of men being stung. Orchardmen have
been Btung on the hands, wrists and the
backs of their neoks. Some of them suf
fered agonies and had to take to their
beds, while others merely were incon
venienced for a few hours.
â¢The reason for this I cannot account
for except that it whs the condition of the
. blood. Weak, thin or diseased blood
would naturally have less resistance to
the poison than strong, healthy blood.
And on the Other hand, the poison in
.. c t( d Horn the insect might be of differ
', nt strength at different times. An m
seot 'hat had lain dormant for some hours
would be more likely to eject a stronger
poison than one that had been active for
several hours and perhaps been forced to
defend itself on several occasions.
"There are some who hold to the idea
that the poison that causes so much dam
age to the human race is merely bacteria
that has accumulated on the end of the
insect's probe. In hunting for blood food,
they claim that this probe is driven into
the flesh and the bacteria naturally left
â in the wound.
"But this is not so. The insect secretes
poison ami ejects it at the instant of mak
ing ;he puncture. It has a full set of
poison glands similar to the mosquito.
Were the poison merely collected, as some
claim, it would be of many different kinds
and would produce a result in accordance
with the poison that had been collected.
"I call the Menalolestes picipes a most
dangerous insect for several reasons.
First, because it flies at night, when peo
ple are asleep and unable, or unlikely, to
defend themselves against it until they
have been stung. Secondly, its sting can
prove deadly. And thirdly, few people
think the bug is dangerous. Small chil
dren like its red color and might play
with one with fatal results.
"J'>ut there is a sure and simple remedy.
That is ammonia. If you get stung put a
drop on the wound ami you will not run
much danger of fatal results"
HEAT OF THE EARTH
Professor Agassiz has been for several
years pr^t. with the assistance of Mr.
Preston and C. F. West, making rock
â¢ rature observations while the min
;â¢.'rations of the Calumet and Hecla
my were going on.
They speak as follows: "We have now
attained a vertical depth of 4712 foot and
have taken temperatures of the rock 105
feet; at the depth of the level of Lake
Superior, 655 feet; at that of the level of
the s-ea, 1257 feet; at that of the deepest
part of Lake Superior, 1663 feet, and at
four additional stations, each respectively,
60, SKI and US( feet below the pre
ceding one, the deepest points at wnlch
ti-mpcratures have been taken being 4580
feet.
""We propose when we have reached
our final depth. 4900 feet, to take an addi
tional rock temperature and to publish
the details of our observations. The high
est rock temperature obtained at the
(Kpth of 4550 feet was 79 degrees Fahr.
The rock temperature at a depth of 105
f..-et was 59 degrees Fahr. Taking that
as the depth unaffected by local changes
we have a column of 4475 feet of rock,
with a difference of one degree for every
2-4 feet. The crust of the earth would be
over eighty miles in thickness, except In
places where !t has been reduced by sub
terranean convulsions.
"If there is a rise of one degree for
every 224 feet there is a four-degree rise
every ' MHI feet, or about a twenty-five-de
gree' rise every mile. According to this,
bj penetrating the earth fifty miles the
temperature reached would be 1250 degrees
Fahr. A hole KP miles deep will brir.g the
temperature* up to about 6000 degrees
Fahr."
Costume Rosa Bonheur Really Wore.
There is a widespread impression that
the late Rosa Bonheur was in the habit
of wearing men's attire. This is only par
tially true. She -dressed as a man while
at work in her studio, because this dress
gave her greater freedom of action while
working on her canvases, which were
often of large size.
In pursuit of her studies of horses her
i. vorite subjects, she also found this cos
tume convenient. AVith her strong mas
culine face and short hair she passed very
v.. 11 an a man. ami found that she attract
ed less attention among the horse markets
in this dress than in the usual garb of a
woman. Hence it became her usual at-
V.v- on these excursions.
â¢\t home, on the street and in the usual
walks of lite she wore a plain black dress
without display of any sort. When going
out she donned a plain black bonnet, and
became simply a rather large woman, no
ticeable only for the strength of her ma
tures and the keen penetration of her
dark eyes. She was fond of wearing the
ribbon of the Legion of Honor.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 9, 1899.
The Summer Man and
What He Should
Wear.
IT very frequently happens that the
summer girl overshadows the summer
man. Not In importanceâ far from
that, as he is the mosf important item
ln th._- whole campaign. He is dressed
for, longed for and squabbled for. He
is overshadowed in the matter of clothes.
Those who cater to men and model their
fashions are not held In such high esteem
as those who do the same thing for the
fair sex. Indeed, men are considered just
a wee bit above the frivolities of dress,
and yet, if the truth were known, many
of them are more finicky find fussy about
the s. t of their coats and trousers than
the average woman.
These "lords of creation" have Just as
many infinitesimal changes in tne cut of
their trousers, the length of their coats,
the twist of their scarfs, the brims of
their hats, the shape of their shoes and
the color of th<'ir shirts as have their fe
male relations.
And these little differences, so slight in
themselves uh to be almost imperceptible
to the uninitiated are so marked to the
well informed man that he can detect a
past fashion in a glance. Therefore, it
behooves those who would cater to the
well groomed man to inquire into and
then set forth some of the novelties of
the season for his reading: as well as de
voting pages to the information of his
womankind.
For this season the newest dress shirts
have wide bosoms and two buttonholes.
The cuffs are attached. Gray suede
gloves are still worn, though the prefer
ence now seem to be given to dark tan
Jn handkerchiefs fine linen with narrow
hemstitched border and embroidered ini
tial is en regie for the perfectly dressed
man.
For business wear the ever favorite
double-breasted sack coat is me style
the waistcoat should match. If a single
breasted coat is worn the trousers must
match; if a double-breasted coat the
trousers may be of different material A
derby must be worn with this costume
Colored shirts with cuffs attached are
good form for morning wear, but the col
lar must be of white linen. The Ascot
four-in-hand or "once over" tie is used*
with this costume. The shoes are of rus
set or calf, laced.
For evening wear the little dinner
jacket or Tuxedo is used for informal oc
casions. Twill silk roll collars will be
made on this jacket, and a pique waist
coat is usually worn with it. White twill
silk waistcoats also promise to be pop
ular. *
Three forms of collars are now usedâ
the straight stand up, the stand up with
turned corners, the points of which are
rounded, and the round pointed double
upright.
The golf jacket for this year is green,
which many consider not altogether an
improvement on the old scarlet jacket,
Which lent such a tone of color to the
links. Golf knickers are made tighter at
the knees and less baggy over the hips
than formerly. Thick stockings -of green
tartan plaid are worn, and gaiters are no
longer en regie. L,ow shoes are better for
outdoor sports than ordinary walking
shoes. *
From London the information corn's to
us that there is no change in the shape
of top hats this year. Ttvy are still slight
ly bell-shaped, with the leaf somewhat
less curled than last year. The Prince
wears a broader leaf than is commonly
seen and flatter in the rim than last year.
Frock coats are very much worn in the
West End at present, but when the
weather gets warmer open morning coats
are to be tht; thing. The Prince's heavy
overcoats have velvet cuffs, but that
fashion has not found favor, being of
French importation.
A new fad in underwear is the knee
length "pants." This abbreviated style is
destined to "till a long felt want" with
wheel and golf dr-votees. The innovation
bids fair to revolutionize the trade. Its
advocates reason that there is relatively
no more use for a "continuous per
formance" on the legs than on the arms
in hot weather.
Among certain of the real smart set gold
buttons on full dress waistcoats are af
fected. The wearer's monogram often ap
pears in bas relief.
Black silk and satin broad end ties, with
plain band and artistically embroidered
ends, are much affected. Some new ef
fects in rumehunda neckerchiefs are now
used to complete man's outfit for the gen
tler sports. They are worn as sashes. Bl

cycle hose this year is of the unobtrusive
class. Fancy tops are still proper, but the
colors and designs are quieter and neater.
All bicycle trousers are made with cuffs
which button at the side, but these are
now mad" of the same materials as the
body of the garment. Full suits of the
same material are not worn by the mak
ers of fashion, but light trousers with a
fancy check or plaid are the thing, with a
sack coat of solid dark color.
The stylish shoe is laced low. but not
so extremely as before, the tops being
above the ankles. This style not only pre
vents the accumulation of sand and small
stones in the shoes, but also conceals the
connection between the footless riding
hose and the ordinary socks. Coats are
cut on the ordinary lines of those- worn
(luring business hours, and can be either
square or round cornered.
With the dark coat and light trousers
a light hat is worn. An effort was made
to do away with the bicycle cap and sub
stitute the fedora, but the attempt has
not met with much approval, owing to the
extra weight and consequent heat of the
felt. The best dressed riders still wear
the caps, and have them to match the
trousers.

THE LOWENTHAL lIJRDEH.
The Woman's Dying Declaration Is
Admitted as Evidence in
the Case.
The preliminary examination of the
soldier. M. J. Mochel. charged with the
murder of Mrs. Ida- Lowenthal in the
Campfire saloon on Kearny street, was
continued before Judge Treadwell yester
day morning at 9 o'clock.
Mrs. S. B. Reid, the nurse who attended
Mrs. Lowenthal till she died, testified that

showing the Judge admitted as evidence
Mrs. Lowenthal's dying declaration, which
had been vigorously opposed by the de
fendant's attorney.
Dr. Fitzgibbon. who attended the woman
at the Harbor Hospital, testified that the
wound itself was serious and was not
produced by a bottle but by a sharp in
strument that penetrated the throat. He
had treated 40.U00 cases of that character
during the past four years, 'which state
ment took the Judge's breath away. See
ing the Judge's amazement, which was
reflected in Prosecuting Attorney Carpen
ter's face, the doctor reduced the number
to 10.000. The case will be argued Tues
day morning.
