sea so thick was this smoke fog around j

that navigation was- considerably im- |

From this it will be apparent that the â

of decreasing, and. ; 'moreover, there are j
strong indications that tviiau-ra. intends |
to Join in the display of fiery fountains

The opinion of the many who have
Just returned from the scene of vol- !
canic fire with faces burned and tanned
to the color of the fashionable leather i
shoes is that the flow will continue for '
months, and will be the largest and ]
most important ever known in the
modern history of the islands.
It is a wonderful sight to watch the j
lava as in its steady flow of about half
a mile a day it meets with an obstruc- â¢
tion, halts like a train of ants to re- ;
ga'rd it and then butts against it.
swells up into a gigantic cone from j
which bursts another flow which grand- '
ly surmounts the barrier in its way,
flinging- broadcast fiery tongues and j
heavinar upward massive bulks of rud- j
dy rooks, which fail with a frightful
splash into the never resting rivers of i
molten earth.
It is almost painful to listen to the,
tales of the pioneer explorers ard their
futile endeavors to depict the grandeur j
â¢f the scene. They^haye the "picture in |
the mind's eye. bur they cannot paint i
it. Nature is too grand for them. They \
will go into immaterial details about [
their arduous tabors, the loss' of their j
shoes, the excruciating sensations of |
mountain sickness and the Itrgth of \
the Sow, and then end by saying, *"I [
wouldn't have missed it for ten thou- !
sand dollars, but I wouldn't do it again j
for twice the sum." It is after all one '
of those things that must be seen to i
be appreciated and that description de- â¢
strays.
The latest details â up to the 15th inst. J
â are that the old lava flow running j
toward Kau had stop-ped and that an
other one had broken out running in
tbout the same direction. The now

Advices by the steamer W. G. Hall-
July IS â wer,e to the effect that the
branch of the eruptive stream which
started down toward Kapapaia has
ceased to flow, and the energy of the
eruption is not concentrated upon the
stream which may eventually reach
Hilo. The reports from that side of the
island. wh:Â»:h reached Kau before the
W. G. Hail left, were that the liquid
lava had reached the plateau upon
which is situated the Humuula sheep
ranch, and that a part of the pasture
land had been covered. Nothing defin
ite, however, upon this point could be
obtained, the main views from that
side having been carried down by the
Kinau. The party that started on Juiy
14 for the- source of the flow had not
returned to the Volcano House when
the W. G. Hall left.
Kilauea is, according to reports of
the latest visitors, smoking very freely,
thouch no Sre has yet broken ' out.
Heavy masses are rolling out, of the
southern end of the crater, and the
small cracks throughout the -crater
floor are giving out smoke and steam.
The heat at the sulphur bath continues
to increase, and everything points to
great activity.
Sheriff Andrews got near the source
of the flow from a different direction..
He started from Honokaa and followed
the road and trail from -"Waixnea lead

"'The - cone or hill from which this
stream is flowing is similar in form to
Punchbowl or Diamond Head. In the
day time you can only know it is ac
tive by the fact that it is constantly
changing form, and by the terrific
noise it makes. But at night you can
see it spouting up molten lava. All of
the lava so far thrown up is the lava
which flows with a different movement
from pahoehoe lava, which advances in
a series of waves."
Frank Davey, a photographer, who
returned by the W. G. Hall, had one
of the most interesting trips of any
man who has visited the eruption.
Davey ascended Ma Una Loa on horse
back to the top, passed around the old
big crater at the summit and then pro
ceeded by foot down the side. From
the. top of the mountain to the head of
the lava flow the artist came upon and
examined eight cones or craters. They
were in succession down the side. Ail
were of considerable size, being nearly
as large as the cone of Punchbowl,
with high wails ail around, except on
the lower sides.
The first five were dead, but ap- j
peared to have been active quite re- j
cently. The sixtft was smoking. In the j
seventh was some fire and considerable |
smoke. The eighth was the wonder of ;
the series. It was belching forth smoke ;
and fire, as well as molten rocks of
great size. "The rocks ere as big as
a horse." explained Davy, "and went ;
so high in the air that they cooled be- \
fore falling again to the ground."
From this crater issued the flow that
is making toward Hilo. Mr. Davey says
that from above, where he was. it pre
sented a grand spectacle winding down
the mountain side. The artist went to ;
the very edge of the spouting crater j.
and made several pictures of it.
Davey is inclined to believe the story
that Humuuia sheep ranch is being
burned up by the flow. He says that
the flow was proceeding in that direc
tion and there was nothing to stop it
If It kept on. The speed was sufficient I

INSPECTION OF

HILO, Hawai!. July 14.â After a j
peaceful slumber of about eighteen !
years the- crater - of Mokuaweoweo j
near the summit of Mauna Loa. Ha- j
waii. has awakened with renewed '
vigor. Early in the morning of the 4th |
of July Madame Pele burst from her [
Ion? imprisonment, and lighted a bon- \
fire, perhaps in commemoration of the)
day. upon a mountain almost 14.000 feet I
above sea level. At about 4 o'clock in j
the momin.e a terrific explosion woke
up some of the inmates of the Volcano
House, who. upon looking out of their
windows, saw the sky all â slow and
witnessed then and there the sight of
a lifetime. It was evident that Mckua-
we-jweo was active. No warning' had
been given of an eruption as frequently
happens â there was no earthquake nor
any smoke seen the previous night is
suing from the crater.
a Large party started from Hilo as
soon as possible for the Volcano House,
thirty miles from Hilo, thence, fully
equipped with provisions and water for
a number of days, they rode away to
the eastern base of the mountain, and
over the flow of ISSL Here the horses
were tethered where there â¢â¢as abun

TON. July 2s.â American men-o-f

the Dominican republic.
As a result of a conference between

the cruiser New Orleans to sail at once
from Newport and the gnnboat Machias
to sail as soon as repairs are completed
from St. Thomas for San Domingo. The
New Orleans is expected to reach San
Domingo about Tuesday of next week.
The Machias is having repairs made,
which will require about eight days to
complete.' She is not expected at the
seat of the threatened trouble before
abo-at the sth or <>th of August. No
specific instructions have been given to
either of the naval commanders. The

The New Orleans is commanded by
Captain E-Iwari Long-neeker. a capable
and discreet officer, in whom the de
partment has the greatest confidence.
The commanding officer of the Machias
is Commander Leavitt C. Lc-gan.
Officially the authorities say that
these vessels are bein^ Â«***.Â»*<*< the
Dominican Government sÂ«ilriy as a.
precautionary measure: that the press
dispatches indicate political intrigues
which may result in revolution, and
that as American interests in the little
republic are paramount to those of any
other ccuntry it is the part of prudence
to have ampie force at hand to see that
full protection is ?iven to those inter
â 
. As to the possibility of annexation as
an immediate outcome of the assassina
tion Secretary Hay and Secretary Long
think that it is going too fast to expect
such a result and rather discourage
this kind of talk. They do not deny,
however, that the United States may
be forced to serious responsibilities in
connection "with the future government
of San Domingo. While no detailed in
formation has been received regarding
the plot which resulted in the assassi
nation of President Heureaux it is be
lieved to be probable that it was plan
ned and executed by partisans of Jimi
nez. the revolutionary leader. It is
known that '-'â -- had lived in fear
of assassination for many months. He
had frankly announced that he pro
posed to continue the Presidency as
long as he lived.
German Interests in this republic are
considerable and President Hereaux
was stronzly backed by them. The fu
ture of the republic may depend largely
upon the course taken by the foreign
element in this crisis-. The course of
the German Government in the present
crisis will be watched with considerable
interest by the American Government.
The finances of San Dominsro are in
a bad way and merchants doing busi
ness there have little hx-pe of any ma
terial improvement unless this Govern
ment in some way takes control of
matters.

"While in my judgment the evidence

ever a case of conspiracy t.> commit

it was in this insiar.ee. The supremacy
and dignity of the law, however, has

The policy of the state as inaugurated

BURNING PEAT ON
THE RIVER ISLANDS
Hot Ashes Found to a Depth of
Twenty Feet Beneath the
Surface.
STOCKTON. July 2S.â Portions of Union
Tsland s' â¢ m to be between two firesâ the
pun overhead and the burning peat, un
derneath. A party of surveyors doing
pome work for County Surveyor Quail had
a warm experience yesterday while run
ning pome lines. One of the men declares
that his feet would get so warm that he
would have to fairly dance in order to get
them off the surface. Several times the
thin crust broke through and he had to
make a hasty jump for more stable under
pinning. When he examined his shoes he
found the soles blackened and covered
with ashes.
In driving over one of the roads the
horse broke through the surface and made
speed to get out of the hole. It was
found that its hoofs were burned and the
hair singed oft the fore legs.
It is evident that portions of the island
are steadily burning Just under the thin,
crust-like surface. Recently an Investi
gation was made at one point in order to
ascertain how far down the smoldering
peat f-xtended. After penetrating an
eighteen-incn surface twenty feet of hot
ashes and burning peat were found.
There is little doubt that many of the,
recent field fires were due to the lire get
ting through the crust and igniting the
train. The deposit of ashes left by the
flames makes cultivation the next year
unsatisfactory, as it destroys many of the,
crop producing qualities of the 8011.

of the army intact and adding:

ARCHBISHOP IRELAND
ON WORLD'S AFFAIRS
NEW YORK, July 28.â Archbishop
Ireland of St. Paul arrived on
the steamship Britannic to-day,
after six months spent in Italy,
France, Belgium, England and
Ireland.
Archbishop Ireland's trip assumed
almost international significance, owing
to the generally accepted belief that he
carried a message frcrm the Catholics
of America to the Pope regarding the
probable attitude of this Government
toward the Catholic church in Cuba,
Porto Rico and the Philippines. Added
interest is obtained because the Arch
bishop has been regarded as the fore
most representative of 'Americanism,"
which recently called down the denun
ciation of European ecclesiastics, and
later was the subject of a Papal com
munication. During his sojourn abroad
Archbishop Ireland was received every
where with most distinguished consid
eration. The Pope was specially gra
cious, and it is thought Archbishop
Inland's influence tempered the tone
of the Papal Utter regarding "Ameri
canism" in the church. Many Catholics
in the I'nited States expected that the
American prelate would return wearing
a red hat, but this hope has not ma
terialized.
"During my stay abroad." said the
Archbishop, "I met many churrhm.-n
and statesmen, and every where I found
the greatest respect for the United
States and an earnest desire to obtain
and retain our friendship. Especially
was this true in France, Belgium and
England. The French vie with the

This spirit was especially noticeable in
official circles. This sentiment is go
ing to have a practical effect in Franc.-.
The United States lias been particularly
favored by the exposition management.
A member of the French Cabinet, in
referring to the matter of the unv.il
ing of the statue of Lafayette next
July, said th>- Government would en
deavor to make the event a worthy
commemoration of the ancient friend
ship b.-tween Fiance and America.
â I d.. not think a majority of the
English people are so hot about an
American alliance. What they
want is simply a perfect understanding
between the two nations and an assur
er an Indefinite continuance of

difficulty. The pahoehoe, however, is
frequently crowded with vesi< lea
which are covered by a thin crust too
brittle to support any weight, conse
quently one is sure to break through.
This many of the partj did, as their
hands and parts of their bodies plainly
show. There Is one kind of pahoehoe
which i.s very level and makes' pood
walking, but wears oui shoes with
amazing rapidity, li is therefore Im
perative that any one making the jour
ney should start provided with sandals
or extra shoes.
Two miles beyond the head of this
flow of 1881 is the scene of action; nol
in the old crater of Mokuaweoweo, bui
just below it. Hen 1 you gee a sight
which is beyond description. From a
hole aboul 500 feel in clrcumfen nee
molten lava, in a state of angry agi
tation, is (lowing with the regularity
and persistency of an artesian well,
and out of the center of which foun
tains with an angry roar dart up to a
height <â :" a( leasi 200 feet; and when in
the air the lava assumes the most fan
tastic shapes imaginable as well as a
variety of colors quite indescribable.
As these fountains descend with i
noise like thunder they splash pieces of
flowing lava in all directions, which
dart through the air with a hissing
sound. From the walls of the cone,
which are at least 100 feet high, three
distinct streams of lava are flowing,
two of which, however, are apparently
becoming inactive. The one flow
rushes from the crater at the speed of
a racehorse, and is about fifty feet wide
at its source, but spreads to a width,
<if over a mile, and as it widens the
Bpeed diminishes. This How is now
about ten miles long and has gradu
ally flowed due north and struck the
base of Mauna Kea, where it is slowly
filling up a hollow. Which side of the
ridge the flow will tak>- when the basin
is filled is yet to be seen. Should it
flow toward Hil<> immense damage will
be done. At the present speed, how
ever, it will take some months to reach
the town.
At night the whole flow of ten miles
is visible throughout, like a tongue of
fire and every here and there discharg
ing what look like redhot bullets. From
an adjacent cone â about 100 feet away
â a magnificent view is to be had.
Nearer than this it is impossible to re
main more than a minute or two at a
time, for the heat is so intense. Under
font, through the fissures in the old
lava, you can see the hot lava bub
bling along and making for the mouth
(if the crater at a wonderful speed.
Tlv Bight is so fascinating that you
forget the fatigue of tho journey and
gaze at the ever changing scene tho
whole night through; and it is only the
thought that provisions may run short
and that you are many miles from
water that at daybreak after one last
long look you decide to return.
To reach tin- crater and return is a
four days' journey from the Volcano
House, allowing one night and a part
of two days at the flow, or six days
from Hilo, and it is well worth the
time and expense.

AS WITNESSED
BY C A. GIBSON
Charles A. Gibson, assistant treasurer
for J. D. Spreckels & Bros. Co.. who re
turned yesterday from the Hawaiian
Islands, was a spectator of the volcanic
eruptions on Mauna Loa. When the flow
commenced he was a guest at the Volcano
House, thirty miles distant from the cra
ter, and subsequently approached close to
the scene of the fiery disturbances. Said
he:
"About 4 o'clock on the morning of July
4 we were waked by the cook of the Vol
cano House. He was probably one of the
first persons to notice the eruption, and
his attention was attracted to it by a pe
culiar ruddy glare which burst into the
kitchen of tin- hotel. The sight I shall
never forget. It was grandly spectacular.
From a point two miles distant from the
old crater on Manna Loa, which had been
cool for marly twenty years. Same was
shooting hundreds of feet Into the air. The
idea of disarmament, but the decision
to establish an arbitration tribunal will
be a victory for the United States. Such
a tribunal would do much to abolish
war. As soon as such a tribunal is
established public sentiment will com
pel the nations to appeal to it before
resorting to war. The situation in
P:urope is so delicate that no country
is willing to disarm. That is too much
to ask. But if an arbitration tribunal
is established disarmament will grad-
ually come about.
"I do not believe there is any danger
of a great European war, as all nations
are anxious for peace.
"While in Rome I saw the Pope fre
quently. The Holy Father was looking
remarkably well. His physical condi
tion, though not robust, seemed on the
whole excellent. I saw him both before
and after the operation performed last
spring. His mind is as vigorous as ever,
and altogether he is a wonderful old
man, who will probably live in the full
possession of his faculties for years to
come. He is- still much interested in
public affairs, and he has a hi^h regard
for the I'nited States.
"There is. much interest in Europe
over our conduct of affairs in the Philip
pines. The general impression is that
the United States should lose no time
in restoring order there; that it is folly
Ito procrastinate and temporize. Most
i men in public life regard our possession
, of the islands favorably. The fact that
; we have been unable to secure the re
lease of Spanish prisoners held by the
Filipinos, has, however, created a very
bad impression. They think that since
we have put Spain out we should find
some way to redeem our pledges. This
is a matter much commented on in
Europe. In Rome the belief prevails
that the interests of the Catholic
Church will be better protected under
American than native rule.
"I notice a decided improvement in
the conditions in Ireland," said the
Archbishop. "The plan of elective
county councils is giving general satis
faction and is a decided step toward
home rule. But," he concluded, "this is
the country for me. There is no other
like it, and I'm glad to be home again."
When the Archbishop met a Call re
porter on the steamship his first re
mark was about the death of Colonel
Ingersoll."
"I see you've buried Ingersoll," he
Baid.
"No, they've cremated him," was the
reply.
"Well, well," reflectively, and a deft
turn carried the talk into another chan
nel.
Archbishop Ireland spent a quiet day
at the Fifth Avenue Hotel, where he re
ceived a few callers. He expects to go
to St. Paul in a day or two. It may be
that he will visit Washington on the

ing country, and as the eruption was in
Its Incipient stands the first stream of lava
resembh <i a fiery snake slowly creeping
down the mountain side. The fury of the
firsi volcanic eruption was greater than
i!, se following. Bowlders of incredible
slona were hurled into the air, and
the lava spouted as if from a fountain.
Aftfp a time the (iens.' veil Of smoke
which overhung the lofty furnace added
to Its terrible scenic effect.

On the Â»;tli of July 1 climbed the mountain

lava slowly streaming in th** direction of
tin- table-lands between Mauna Loa and
Mauna Ken. which form an immense tm

"There is no imminent danger. Evc-ry- i
thing depends upon the overflow of the
basin when it becomes tilled. Should it I
break on the eastern side the flow will be
in tin 1 direction of Hilo. but it may never I
reach the town. On the western slope cat
tle ranges are In danger. Before T depart
ed from Honolulu rumors reached the 1
town which caused men to make an imme- i
diate departure to bring the herds to a ;
place of Bafety. Compared with the erup- I
tlons of 1559 and 1881., I have it from old
residents thai the present disturbance la
greater. When we were out to sea I no
t !<â â¢â .! that the action had increased and
the flre was bursting forth from what ap
peared to be a long ridge on the side of
the mountain. While at the Volcano
House I counted at least eight seething
craters."

ESTERHAZY WILL
NOT BE A WITNESS
Refuses to Be PreseQt at the
SecoQd Trial of His Victim,
Captain Dreyfus.
PARIS July 28 âThere is one point upon which both Dreyfusites
and anti-Dreyfusltes are in perfect accord. That is the importance of
Esterhazy's appearance as a witness at the new trial in Rennes. The
disgust is therefore general at the news that he refuses to attend, not
withstanding the safe conduct given him by the Government, which
guarantees him against arrest until after the trial is concluded.
The Matin gives a declaration made by Esterhazy to a correspondent
to the effect that it is not for him to speak, but for the generals for
whom he has openly accused to justify their acts. He is curious to see
whether they will do this at Rennes. But at any rate he is not going to
be present at the trial of his victim,- Captain Dreyfus.
LAW AND ORDER
IN CLEVELAND
Streetcars Are Being
Well Patronized.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, July 28.â
A car returning from Euclid
Beach Park was blown up by
dynamite about 11 o'clock to
night. The explosion took place
a short distance north of the
Lake Shore Railroad, two miles
east of the city limits. There
â were no passengers on board,
and the motorman and conductor
escaped without injury.
CLEVELAND, July 28.â Slowly and
surely law and order are triumphing
over lawlessness and disorder and the
city is beginning to resume its old ap
pearance. To-day the street cars were
well patronized, especially during the
busy hours of the morning and even
ing. This is said to be the best indi
cation that the city government is win
ning in the struggle.
Mayor Farley is well pleased with the
situation, but he has not relaxed his
vigilance one whit and will not until
the last vestige of disorder is wiped
away. The Mayor and Adjutant Gen
eral Axline are at present involved in
a controversy over what the troops
shall do and what they shall not do.
The adjutant general is of the opinion
that the duty of the National Guard is
merely to put down rioting and not t<>
do police duty. Whatever the duty of
the National Guard may be. Mayor
Farley holds that the troops are here
under his authority and they will re
main here until he feels that they can
be dispensed with. The responsibility
of preserving the order of the city rests
upon the shoulders of the Mayor, he
says and he proposes to see that his
plans are not interfered with by any
one. He declares that he is to be the
judge as to when the troops are not
wanted.
There have been several outbreaks
between Mayor Farley and Adiutant
General Axline within the last few
days over this question. To-day the
Mayor refused to discuss the dilneulty.
saying that this was no time, to stir
up any discord.
"I will merely reiterate my statement
of last night." said the Mny.tr; "this is
a time for every man to mind his own
business." 1
The Mayor takes but little interest in
the talk of boycotting merchants. He
believes that just as soon as quiet is
restored and the fever is gone, all such
talk will cease. A boycott, he feels, is
against natural laws; that a man will
not pay 6 cents for an article that can
be purchased for five and a man will
not walk a mile to make a purchase
when he can get what he wants at a
quarter of a mUe.
It is said at the City Hall that there
are quite a number of recent employes
of the street railway company who
would go hack to work if permitted,
but that they are hindered by threats
from some of the more radical em
ployes and the leaders of the strike.

were compelled to lay down their tools
\n effort will be made for an amicable
adjustment of the controversy between
the strikers and the North Side manufac
turers at a conference which has been
cilled by the Chicago Masons' and Build
ers' Association for 10 o'clock to-morrow
morning. All the Interests directly in
volved will be represented. Unless one
side or the other recedes from the position
heW thus far little will be accomplished
it the conference. The strikers st. as
sert that they will stand firm until all the

UEreement, and the manufacturers say
that they will stick it out If their yards

LARGE EXHIBITS
FOR STATE FAIR
Expensive Displays to
Be Made.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, July 2S.â The directors
of the State Agricultural Society are de
termined that there shall be no common
place exhibits at the approaching State
fair. That the exhibits will be more elab
orate and artistic than in former years
is assured. One big mercantile firm in
Sacramento will erect a special structure
for its display that will cost no less than
$700. An Eastern firm will enter the pa
vilion with a display that will cost $1000.
The decorations In the bix exposition
building will be appropriate and tasteful,
and it is intended that the exhibition shall
be in complete readiness on the Sunday
evening before the opening of the fair.
Musical novelties are promised for each
evening 1 by an immense band of accom
plished musicians.
Secretary Peter J. Shields declared to
day that enough applications for space
had already been filed to nil the hall.
Citizens generally commend the season
ticket plan adopted by the directors, and
there is no doubt the attendance from
the outset will be greater than the ex
position has ever witnessed. The mer
chants of Sacramento are holding meet
ings almost nightly for the purpose of
co-operating with the directors in arrang
ing special features for the entertain
ment of the thousands who will attend
the pavilion nightly.
As for the races, it is conceded that
they will offer some of the finest sport
ever witnessed in the West, the purses
being large and the entries in each class
numerous.

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:
The undersigned, a resident of the city or
Dcs Moines for the past thirty-seven year?, de-
sires to bear testimony to the skill of Dr.
Aborn In the treatment of pulmonary ann kin-
dred complaints. About the year 1576 I was
very seriously afflicted with . brononlal ana
lung troubles: in fact, had two or three r its
severe hemorrhages, and my left lung was prac-
tically useless. Dr. Aborn treated me consti-
tutionally and by local inhalation applications,
and within two ninths' time 1- was practically
cured. I continued the treatment for some time
longer and have never Buffered a day since from
any trouble of the kind. And my lunps and
bronchia! tubes have been sound. I believe, -as
any one's could be, and are at the present
time, after a lapse, of twenty-three years. I
have known the doctor and of his successful
practice for the past thirty years. _
During the doctor's practice at that time I
personally knew of a number of people whom
he treated with pronounced success. From my
own personal experience and observation of his
treatment of others. I believe the doctor to be
capable of doing a frreat good to persons af-
fluted with such troubles, jÂ»Â£*Â£gg%
DR. ABORN'S TREATMENT
Gives instantaneous relief, builds up
and revitalizes the whole constitu-
tion, fortifies the system against
colds and catarrhal affections and

SAN QT'ENTIN PRISON. July 23.â
The "cpium ring" has been indus
triously at work of late laying in sup
plies for the next year. Through a
mere accident a discovery was made
yesterday implicating twenty-one men
in the smuggling and sale of the drug,
and to-day the dungeon was so crowd
ed that six convicts had to be placed in
the solitary ceil.
George Barney, a prisoner driving
the commissary wagon, dropped a let
ter yesterday giving a clev.- to the
smuggling methods and â was the first
to go into the dungeon. He had only a
few months more to serve of a seven
years' sentence for grand larceny from
San Francisco and will lose two years'
credits. The only ether convict* under
going- punishment whose name is
known is Frank Marshall, serving a
long term for burglary committed at
i-es -Angeles.
Almost all the smugglers were ar
rested in the jute mill, and the opium
discovered on their persons and in
their cells aggregates a large quantity.
Rumors are flying thick and fast to
r.ighi. of an attempted escape, in which
about ten of the men in the dun
geon are said to have been concerned.
Agnirre adrr.its that a lucky discovery
has led him to believe he will detect the
ringleaders in the opium ring, but de
nfes that any attempt has been made to
escape.
The real reason why so much opium
has lately got inside "the '.vails is that
no euard* feeis sure of staying longer
than August 1. To make places for his
friends Acuirre has discharged Guards
Duffy ar.<: Jessup. A L-:-s Angeles man
was appointed to fill one vacancy to
day. Guard J.^hn Jones' salary was
raised to SIOO t.:-day, which is taken to
rr.--ar> that another man will soon re
ceive the position.
It was discovered to-day that in or
der to help pay Don Jose Aguirre's sal
ary as crV^ra'l 520 has been
clipped off the salary of Chaplain

with his wife and family. He ar
rived on the ->teamer Moana on his
way to Washington. He is not quite
certain "as to the duration of his stay in
this city, but in all probability he will not
leave for the East before Tuesday next.
The Judre. who is a gentleman well ad

riage, willingly granted the following^ in

To this paper he said he was always will

possible for a man in his official position.
as it enjoyed a reputation for correctness
and fair dealing.
When asked for a general resume of the
situation in the islands the Judge said:

the native.* to disarm. The rrbels did s_> j
first. Immediately afterward the govern- \
men: party surrendered its arms also. Al
together there were given up over 4*JO ;
rifles, which is supposed to be. within a :
few hundred, all the arms in the island. ;
All previous tempts at disarmament had
proven failures, and the success of the
Commissioners was due chiefly to their
unanimity of action. [, fact, the success

were taken to the Badgtr. The Com- ;

manner satisfactory and efficient. But >
since then nothing seems to ' â 'â :'â  j

to get the support from the Commission- j
ers necessary to maintain the honor and j
dignity of his court, which is openly [
flouted in the most disgraceful manner
and its commands ar.d decrees laughed !
at, is leaving here to-day, although he j
has offered to the Commissioners, who j
have requested him to continue in orSce. ;
until matters have been settied by the |
three powers, to stay six months if need- j
ful if the Commissioners would grant â aim ;
the assurance that the court would be j
respected and its orders enforced. The
Commissioners had to admit to the Chief
Justice that they could not as a commis
sion grant the requested assurance, and
the necessary consequence is his Honor's j
departure. His enemies and opponents i
assert that he has been recalled, but this
Is not the fact, and President McKinl^y \

go behind that decision. This unanimity
will have the effect of reducing the Com- j
missloners to a mere body of reporters. |
There will be a unanimous report on the
lines "ready published, but at the same
time the Commissioners will each submit I
a separate report to their respective Gov- i
ernments. and It will be found that their j
unanimous report is only" a modification i
of the Berlin treaty, which is recommend

of the Sam difficulty. During- the last
month the Commissioners have visited the
different island? in the group. At Tutuiia \

the Commissioners had done or suggested. j

government under an official appointed by
the three powers. Savaii was next visited.

HONOLULU, July 21.â
United States collier Brutus ar
rived from Samoa on the 17th
and is booked to sail on Surtday
next for Guam. Lieutenant Saf
ford has I â¢â _-:. presented with his
commission as Deputy Governor
of Guam. He reports all quiet
at Samoa. E. "W. Gurr, an Eng
lishman, Is before Chief Justice
Chambers on the charge of hav
ing trampled on a German flag
captured from the rebel forces.
Gurr's version is that he wished
to take the Rag to prevent a dis
turbance, but in the scuffle it fell
to the ground and was acci
dentally trodden upon. The in
cident is causing some excite
ment for fear of consequences.
Malietoana spoke at the meeting' or at
tempted in any way to take a prominent
part thereat, there ensued a tight with
axes. knives and stones right in the pres
ence of the Commissioners. The Mataafa
people, when approaching the Commission
ers with a "taalolo." or food offering,
found the Maiietoa people coming in the'
opposite direction with the same obiect
This enraged some Mataafans. and they
immediately rushed at the opposite party,
severely woun^.ng one man. who is not
expected to live, and several others in
more or less degree. Called upon by the
commission, the chiefs had the eiheute
stopped, and the business proceeded.
Mataafa was a: the meeting. Here the
rebels stated that they would and did ac
cept the abolition of the kingship. They
alpo fell In aril the idea of an adminis
trator or Governor to be the head of the
Government, but they did not want that
supreme facial appointed by the three
â¢-â ..â  to elect him them
selves from amonÂ£ the old and well-known
residents of Samoa who knew the natives
and their ways and customs.
On July 4 word came to town that just
across the Island at Safata there was
fighting. Some Mataafa supporters <Sua
tele's adherents) made an attack at even
ing on a chief's house while the inmate*
were en?a?ed at family worship The
Chief Taamui was badly wounded, as
were two others. Immediately H. M. S
Torch. Captain Preedy, was off "to "the
scene. Suatele had in the meantime rone
to - .fata, and there be and the Ma!iÂ«toa
chief met Captain Precdy and agreed that
the trouble was over: !t was a family
matter, they said, and had no political sig
nlficance. ~i.V
The Torch returned, nothing being done
to punish the offenders. At this the Mali
etoa men at Safata took offense and a few
days later made an attack on Suatele"s
people as they were returning- from
church. One man was killed outright and
several -wounded. Two of the wounded â 
were suatete's adopted sons. He brought
them at once to Apia and took them to
the German hospital, where one ha.* since
died. The warships Torch and Cormorant
steamed again to Safata and arrested two*
Malietoa chiefs and one Mataafa chief,
who are now lodged in the jail in Apia
pending the result of an inquiry into the
matter when the Safata delegates are
through with the meeting at Mulinuu.
Mataafa has never been to Apia since he
visited the Commissioners on the Badger
at the lifat ie agreed to surrender his
arms. He accepts without reservation the
abolition of the kingship.
President Solf took office on June 10 and
immediately ha' trouble with Vice King
Tamasese and chiefs, who considered that
although Tanu had abdicated the kingship
they still constituted a Samoan govern
ment. Bolt at first seemed inclined to be
bumptious and precipitated serious trou
ble. The Commissioners were appealed to
and they requested the Chief Justice to ',
see the 'Malietoa chiefs and try to settle
things amicably. This Soil did. The fol
lowing was his" Honor's speech on the oc
casion:
It was made clear in the proclamation issued
Sir the Hit Commissioners on the ICth d this
month: first that the decision riven by me
on the Zl*l of Eieceraber, ISSS. â ring M&lie
toa Tanumafiii to be the Kin? of Samoa was
valid and cannot be ehansed. Second, that !
Malietoa voluntarily, of hts own free wtll. In- ! '
Suenced alone by what cc believed was best j
for his country and people, dearer to him than
royalty, save* uo the kingship. Third, that i .
this rr.arr.animous sacrifice, which doubtless
cannot be appreciated properly by one who
has never tasted the sweets of royalty, removed
him from all connection wtth any kind of sov
â¢rr.rnent in Samoa: an.i the High Commission
ere exercising authorities grtv^n them by the â¢
Governments of England. Germany and â  the
L'nited ?ta:es. declared the kingahtp abolished.
Fourth, a government was Â«et up by the Hiyh

After his abdication Tanu intended to ero j '
to Sydney ar.d remain there for some time ; '
and th^ Torch was put at his disposal to â  !
carry him as far as Fiji, where his sister, '; '
the Princess Faamiui. is living. The Torch â¢
was under orders to go to Fiji to brine up
an acting British Consul in place of Consul ;
Maxse. and when the Maiietoa chiefs
beard of Tanu's intended departure they ;
got an idea that he was being sent away
by the Commissioners. Their minds were ;
disabused of this, and Tanu Informed his ;
chiefs that he would comply with their i
wish and remain ir, Samoa.
Last week the Chief Justice issued or- i
ders to certain towns in Samoa to appear
before the Supreme Court in certain civil
cases where the judgments of the court !
had not been complied with. Sanati or- }
dered the towns not to appear. The towns
of Safotuafai did not appear, while from â¢
the remaining- ones only Malietoa chiefs
attended. Sanati's orders were to pay no ,

JUDGE FITZGERALD'S
ENEMIES ARE ACTIVE

LOS ANGELES. July - ; âJudge W. F. j
Fitzgerald has wired to friends here that I
he will be in Los Angeles on Monday and j
will at once assume his duties upon the )
Superior bench of Las Angeles County, j
The opponents of Judge Fitzgerald were
reiterating to-day that the new Superior j
Judge could not legally serve as Judge i
Clark's successor and that at the proper !
time Fitzgerald's right to sit upon the I
Superior bench of this county would be j
judicially tested. The promoters of the
campaign against Judge Fitzgerald have
thus far been working mysteriously, it
being difficult to find out their pians. It is
stated; however, that Major Horace Bell
is at the head of a movement to keep
Judge Fitzgerald off the Superior Court
bench. For years the two have not been
friends. Their differences arose over ;
a matter of practice a long time ago.
The enemies of Judge Fitzgerald persist !
that according to section 5S of the Politl
cal Code the Judge is not qualified to sit !
as an appointed member or the Superior :
Court of >-os Angeles County and that [
when the time arrives the legal quest- ,
tion involved will be brought up on quo

Premier Believes That if the Latest
Concessions Axe Genuinely
Carried Out There Will
Be No Clash.
Sp-clal DiÂ«patch to â -â¢ Call.
LONDON*. July 2*.â ln the House of
Lords to-day the Earl of Camperdown
called attention to the Transvaal situa
tion. The Ear! of Burxraven and others
followed, all declaring that any departure
from the recognized policy of the Gov
ernment would be an act of Inestimable
danger to the position of Great Britain,
not only in South Africa, but it misrht
?hake the imperial existence of Great
Britain ... The Earl of Selbourne. Un
der Secretary for the Colonies, made a
statement similar In purpose to that made
in the House of Commons by Mr. Cham
â  - -
Lord Salisbury reminded the hou?
- - - from I
- â  .. | t with tl
jrav* fault ( ptii tisn v " -
Pr â . j - i in the proto

- â¢ f the races, while he has since
- . - â  posil
t being; i - â  â  rate the Ens ... -
nenta to redu
g - â¢ the status of a subjugated
race.
The Premier declared he was not sur
prised that panic overtook President Kru- j
ger at the interruption of the go!- 1 - dig
ging in S6: but he blamed him for not
consulting the British Government as to
how to deal with the phenoraenoa. He j
agreed that if the latest concessions were j
genuinely carried ou the Government
might look forward to a peaceful solution I
of th# crisis. Her Majesty's . eminent i
he naid. had put its hands to the plow
and certainly did not want to withdraw
them.
Regarding the dispatch?? of Sir George
Hamilton, Secretary of State for India,
and L-ord Curzon of Keddleston. the In
dian Viceroy, the Premier said the report
cf the Committee on the India Currency
said the Government had decided to main
tain the closing of the mints and directed
him to take the necessary steps to make
p. sovereign legal tender at the rate of
15 rup<*es to the sovereign.
In the House of Commons to-day the
Colonial Office vote furnished the Liberals
with ar. opportunity for a debate on- the
Government's policy in the Transvaal.
Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman. the Liberal
leader, said he thought that In view of
the negotiations pending reticence and re
serve must rule the debate. While he did {
not sympathize with Boer opposition to
the franchise extension; he saw nothing
from the beginning to the end of the story
to justify intervention. War over South
Africa would be one of the direst calam
ities possible. The speaker pleaded for
further friendly and prudent action
through Dutch sympathizers at the Cape.
He saw no reason why this should not
achieve conspicuous success, as a similar
course had done in Canada in times past.
The Secretary of State for the Colonies,
Joseph Chamberlain, opened his speech in
reply by declaring that Sir H. Campbell-
Bannerman's language was calculated to
embarrass the cctlon of the Government.
The grievances of the Outianders. Mr.
Chamberlain said, were admitted on all
hands to be serious, but the most serious
part was that the outrageous treatment
to which they were subjected was part of
the settled policy pursued by the Boers.
The situation was dangerous to imperial
interests. As regarded the racial feud
coming out of war. race antagonism al
ready existed and was poisoning the com
munity. The danger of disaffection in
Cape Colony and the range Free State
was entirely <\ue to the action of the
Transvaal. It was not a question of a
five or seven years' franchise, but power
and authority of the empire and of the
position of Great Britain in South Africa.
Referring to offers of colonial help. Mr.
Chamberlain said that if the matter were
arranged it would always be a satisfac
tion to think that in time of trouble the
country might count upon the loyalty of
the colonies. Mr. Chamberlain justified
the right of Intervention â firstly, because
it was the right of every civilized power
to protect its own subjects: secondly, be
cause Great Britain had the right of in
tervention under the new convention as
the suzerain power, and thirdly, because
the convention had been broken In letter
and spirit.
Referring to Sir Campbell-Bannerman a
eulogy of Hon. W. B. Schreiner. formerly
Prime Minister of Cape Colony, and J.
Hofmeier. the Afrikander leader. Mr.
Chamberlain said both of them had de
clared that the earlier and illusory pro
posals of President Kruger were entirely
adequate and satisfactory. When they
were quoted as impartial judges, whose
assistance the Government ought to in
vite the House must remember that they
had' been at least a little premature. In
dealing with the latest proposal, Mr.
Chamberlain said: . . _ __, _
â¢â¢President Kruger has invited friendly
advice and the Government has thought
itself justified in appealing to him that &
joint Inquiry should be held. These pro
posals were with the view of determining
what representation will be immediately
given aliens, which can be the only basis
of satisfactory settlement. If the inquiry-
Is accepted experts will be pointed, and
the Government hopes that then it will
be possible to reach an agreement. In any ;
case the Government will press for neces
sary alterations In order to secure the ob
ject' in view. We have undertaken the
cauÂ«e of the Outlanders. and are bound
:to see' it through. We shall not rest un
i til a conclusion satisfactory to us has
i been reached. I anticipate that the ef
-1 forts will be successful, but we will not
i tie our hands in regard to measures that
j may be necessary to fulfill anticipations. "
The House adopted the Colonial OSce
vote without a division, after a protracted
debate upon the South African policy of
the Government.

OFFERS ITS LINE
TO UNION PACIFIC
Northern Pacific Makes
a Proposition.
itch 1 Tbm
TACOMA. July H âPresident C. 5 MÂ»!
--len of the Northern Pacific Railway. In
_â¢ â¢ - â  I the i
-
"We have offered the Oregon Railway
and Navigation Company, which Is the
Union Pacific system, to let It run into
Tacoma over our tracks from Portland
ar.d to give them terminals here, so far
as we have any say in the matter, at very
reasonable terms. They may accept our
proposition. The terms are entirely satis
factory. If they are not we will make
them factory. It would be to our in
terest as well as theirs to let them run in
over our tracks rather than build an ad
ditional line. We would rather divide the
cost and expense cf maintaining one line
than to pay all the cost ourselves. The
traffic between h-re and Portland for
many years can all be done over the one
line "and not be crowded. As for terms,
we* wili make terms that are satisfactory.
â The war between the Northern and the
Union is most in the newspapers. Many
of the stockholders are owners in botn
roads, and where we can save money by
such an agreement it will be made. And
I have no doubt this arrange] will be
made as soon as the Union gets around to
take the matter up. They will have their
own terminals here and be entirely inde
pendent of us, both roads using the same
track. The Northern Pacific wUI continue
to make Tacoma its main terminus on tho
Pacific and the place where the Oriental
commerce is carried on as long as- we
have our docks and terminals here. If we
had the same facilities in Portland and
Seattle as we have here we would take
the business to the town that was the
most enterprising ar.d where the people
were the best hustlers. We have already
acquired large terminals at Seattle. The
deal fcas been closed though it has not
been given to the public. We shall natur
ally utilize the land.
"'lf we had the facilities In Seattle that
we have here we could as well do thr
business there as here. The distance is
no greater. But at Tacoma we have the
term;:: ils already built, and here we shall
continue to do the main bulk of our Ori
ental business as long as we can. ke-;p
room enough to handle it."

ROOSEVELT URGED
THAT GENERAL OTIS
BE CALLED HOME
Dissatisfaction Also Expressed
With Alger s Conduct of the
War Department,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. WEL
LINGTON HOTEL, WASHINGTON
July 28.â The Interesting statement is
made in connection with the retirement
of Mr. Alger from the Cabinet that
Governor Roosevelt of New York wrote
a letter urging his retirement, and also
that Genera] Otis be relieved in the
Philippines, and Brooke be superseded
by Wood as military governor of Cuba.
This letter, it is stated, was written by
Governor Roosevelt to a member of the
Cabinet some time prior to the. last
general outburst of anti-Alger talk,
and several weeks before his actual
resignation, and is said to have been
the cause of a revival of the matter
after xYlger had said several times in
answer to earlier rumors that he would
not resign.
Secretary Hay is mentioned in one
.quarter as the recipient of the letter,
but this the Secretary will not admit.
It is stated that in his letter Gover
nor Roosevelt was very severe in his
criticism of the general course of the :
War Department, and insisted that the !
administration could not afford to be
held responsible for Alger, or to con- j
tinue the military policy in the Philip
pines or In Cuba. He argued for more
vigorous and effective operations. It
is stated thai this letter was shown to
the President at once, as it was intend
ed it should be, and that from this
started the renewal of the demand for
Alger's retirement that resulted in his
resignation.
When the President sent for Governor
Roosevelt, as he did some little time
before Alger resigned, it is said that >
the object in calling him to the White
House was to talk over this letter, and .
to try to reach an understanding that
would avoid hasty action in the matter. â¢

MANILA. July 2^.â ln compliance with
an order received from Madrid the Span
ish transport Alva will proceed from Ma

in order, to repatriate the garrison and the
inhabitants of those islands.
Th-re is great interest in the first
attempt of a cable boat to follow the

end of Lagruna de Sal, this morning.
after making connection with the land
wire and successfully laid eighteen miles
of cable. It is expected that the cable
boat -will reach Calamba to-night.
I there will be a reasonably fair contingent
; of new comers, a large proportion of them
being Investors.
The cleanup is now fairly begun, and
1 promises to realize all that has been cx
i pec ted of it. The old creeks, Uonanza
I and El Dorado, are performing as they
\ have for two seasons past, while the
I branches on both are turning out niarvel-
I ously. Hunker and Dominion creeks and
! Upper Sulphur are turning out better than
I last season, and the benches or hillsides
are here, too. producing more than was
expected of them. Gold Run and Eureka
Creek will add considerable to the general
footing. There has been and is still much
anxiety over the water question. Th
washup began this year fully a week ear
lier than last year, but cold weather set
I in and checked it. The weather has since
' continued cool, and only within the last
! few days has there been a sufficient flow
! of water to warrant me work being un
dertaken in earnest. The dumps are still
frozen, and this makes the shoveling in
heavy and slow. Whether the water will
last for the complete cleanup is the im
portant question. I shall to-morrow start
on a general tour of the creeks and gain
what data may be possible as to the sit
uation and the value of the year's output.
The fire of the 26th of April swept out of
! existence two lilorkst of buildings, includ-
I ing nearly all the dancehalls on Front
street, the big Alexander McDonald build
ing and the Hank of British North Amer
ica on Second street. The bank's vault
was destroyed and all the papers in it
: were burned.
About half a ton of gold dust was sea
tered in the ruins, and the charred earth
! about, the vault had to be run through a
rocker to save the yellow stuff. The bank
will be rebuilt in brickâ the first brick
â  building of Dawson. Clay has been found
. on the hillside back of town, a kiln has
: been built and the . bricks are ben
I burned. The fire stared in the rooms of
a woman of the town, Helen Holden, over
the Bodega saloon, on Front street. The
fire engine, which drew its water supply
1 through a hole in the ice on the river,
\ was over thirty minutes in raising steam,
i and to this was directly blamed the spread
iof the fire. The Governor and his Council
; have thus since been supplied with pier.
: of work. They have been making an ex-
I tended inquiry into the cause of the lire
department's failure, with a promise at
the end of reorganizing it.
A self-appointed Fire Commission ha
summarily dismissed the chief the day
after the fire, but he refused to recognize
Its authority. After an extended Inquiry
into . the cause of the fire the Council
passed an ordinance requiring the demi
monde to move back two blocks further
from the water front, or the business part |
of the town. This was intended to put a |
full block between the business houses ;
and the houses of the scarlet women, in i
which latter most of the fires have had J
their origin. The order at first confined '
them t*Â».wo blocks in the center of the
swamp/and immediately the land specu
lator saw his opportunity. He proposed
to build a great bagnio covering these two
blocks "nnd setting a rental upon each of
its divisions that in the aggregate would !
have beeen better to him than any gold ,
mine in the Klondike. â  â  â 
The Council, however, saw its mistake.
THE SAN FE AN CISCO CALL, SAT UHP AY, JULY 29, 1899.
and gave the women the right to go
wherever they would po long as they kept
three blocks away from the water front.
This had the effect of bringing the rent
down to $2 50 a front foot for land within
the same two blocks referred to, and th< re
the tenderloin, is being re-established. The
women have to effect their removal be
fore June 1.
Following this order of the Council came
another from the commissioner gov. rnor
ring the tenants of the water front
to sign a lease, under which they might
be removed on or after the loth of June,
and requiring them to pay rent in advance
to that time. The occupants of the shacks
along the water front had been petitioning
for an extensionof their leas* hold through
thi coming summer, while many, contend
ing that the grant of the lease orig
inally was illegal, had been refusing to
pay rent and hid yet been allowed to re
main. Tinier threats of eviction, how
ever, they had finally asked for time in
which to appeal to Ottawa, and as a tacit
consent to this the ord< r referred to Mad
been issued. Many fearing that th< y
would be compelled to move in the middle
of the busy season prepared to move now.
and did so, tearing down their buildings
and leaving greal naps in the water front.
Others signed the lease, and as the end in
viewâ that of opening up the water front
for steamboat landings and for fire emer
genciesâhas been in a measure conserved.
they hope to be allowed to remain there
indefinitely.
yesterday afternoon th* first steamboat
from down the river arrived, the John C.
Barr of the North American Transporta
tion and Trading Company. She had been
wintering in the river about thirty miles
below Forty Mile in a very dangerous po
sition and" the odds were laid heavily
that she would be broken up by the ice.
She met with no Injury whatever and re
ports that the Arnold of the Alaska Ex
ploration Company, which was lying back
of an island four miles farther up the
river from her, also escaped injury. The
event, therefore, so much longed for and
yet so much dreadedâ the breaking of the
i ee -_} las passed off and nobody is hurt.
The flagrant scandal just now of this
town of many scandals, the one that
hurts Americans, is the Consul, James
Church McCook. He is a most conspicu-
Hgure in the dance halls and the
water front saloons and has so fallen in
the general esteem that an American Is
loth to be seen on the street with him.
Hia suit for libel against a local paper,
that wrote up one of his escapades, has
not come to trial, but. if it be a Jury trial,
the paper is certain to win. There is a
greal deal of sickness in the city, princi
pally scurvy. The Queen's birthday was
observed yesterday by outdoor sports that
entertained the public throughout the day
and by a grand ball In the evening. Great
numbers of men Were In from the creeks
and public- or official business was sus
pended; the business of the saloons was
vastly increase. 1. To-day the great
scramble for gold is resumed.
CRITICIZE LABOR
COUNCIL'S LETTER
Hawaiian Planters on
Contract System.
BY HORACE WRIGHT.
HONOLULU, July 21.â Some of the lead
ing planters are, not unnaturally, very
angry at the letter of the secretary of the
Francisco Labor Council, but do not
anticipate any serious effects from it, es
pecially after the careful investigations I
made by the officers of the Italian war
ship recently in our port, which, there is
reason to believe, were decidedly favor
able. That the reports of actual cruelty
art - â so far as regards the present flay â j
grossly exaggerated is an undoubted fact. |
The efforts of the present Government,
and especially the frequent visits and j
close inspection of the Government
agents, have put almost an end to the
hideous acts of cruelty which were report
me few y< ars ago.
It la undoubtedly true that compara
tively recently the Government has had |
to warn certain plantations that they !
could not have any more labor permits
until they treated their present laborers j
with more consideration, and it does oc- !
casionally leak out thai here and there i
are plantations upon which some of the
lunas are little superior to ilemls; but
then these men are being weeded out by
the managers in self-defense.
The whole blame of the matter must be '
placed upon the planters for using their â 
a< c to maintain the penal provisions â 
of the contraci labor law. The readers of
The Call will probably remember that the
present Government made the promise of
repealing tnesi laws one of the strongest .
pleas for annexation, and yet willfully
violated its pledges at the nod of the
planters.
fn his report to the last of our legisla
tures the chief Justice shows that In 1594
--i >f the total ol 7108 civil cases brought
â  the courts no less than :>4i>i! were
for "deserting or refusing bound serv- i
ice"; and for 1896-97 OUi Of 6319 Civil cases;
1:17;: were for the same cause. These facts j
al< ne would appear to be sufficient to con
demn the law without entering into the i
criminal record pertaining to It.
To thoroughly appreciate the meaning
and effect of these laws would be a long .
but interesting story. It would be neces-
Bary to peruse it by the light of half a
century ago. when it was first drafted,
and study the many amendments and de
cisions that have considerably modified It.
In brief, it was originally enacted in the ,
days when the whaling trade was the
main industry and .sugar was in its in- j
fancy. The Chinese were not then here, i
and the principal laborers were the Ha
waiian?. However, leaving history alone, !
the more impartially and even generously
this law is studied, the more heinously
and outrageously out of place it appears
to be on the statute books of a land
Christianized and civilized by New Eng- j
land missionaries.
The most obnoxious sections are as fol
lows:
Section 1413. If any person lawfully hound
to service shall willfully absent blmsell from
such service without the leave of his master,
any district or Police Justice of the kingdom,
upon complaint made under oath by the mas
ter, or by any one on his behalf, may Issue
a warrant to apprehend such person and bring
him before the staid Justice; and if the com
plaint shall be maintained, the justice shall
order such offender to be restored to his mas
ter, and he shall be compelled to serve not to
exceed double the time of his absence. In the
discretion of the court, unless he shall make
satisfaction to the master for the loss and In
jury sustained by such absence; provided, al
ways, that such additional term of service
shall not extend beyond one year next after
the end of the original term of service.
Sec. 1420. If any such person shall refuse to
serve according to the provisions of the last
section, or the terms of his contract, his mas
ter may apply to any district or Police Justice.
where he may reside, -.vim shrill Â»>Â» r>nthâ¢-i7.0.i
by warrant or otherwise to send for the person
so refusing, and If such refusal be persisted in,
to commit such person to prison, there to re
main, at hard labor, until he will consent to
serve according to law.
And in case such person so bound as afore
said shall have returned to the service of such
master in and obedience to such order of said
Justice, and shall again willfully absent himself
from such service without the leave of his mas
ter, such district or Police Justice may fine
such offender not exceeding $â 'â  for the first of
fense, and for every subsequent offense there
after not exceeding $10, and in default of pay
ment thereof such offender shall be imprisoned
at hard labor until such fine is paid; and at
the expiration of such Imprisonment, such
justice shall order such offender to be re
stored to his master to serve for the remain
der of such original term of service.
Sec. 1422. All the costs incurred in any pro
cess against a servant under sections 1419 or
1420 shall be paid in the first instance by the
complainant, and if the complaint shall be sus
tained, the master shall have judgment and
execution therefor against the offending servant.
These sections require no further com
ment than the fact that the Stars and
Stripes float over the islands and the Ga
licians are still in prison under this law.
GERMAN FRUIT MARKET.
I
Growing Demand at Hamburg for the
Dried Output.
BUISUN, July 2S.â Four years ago
' Ernest Luehning tried the experiment of
establishing a dried fruit market in Ham
burg, Germany. The first year he ship
ped twenty carloads and in succeeding
years doubled the shipment named. Mr.
' Luehning has this week completed the
â  erection of one of the largest and best
. quipped warehouse* in the State and
will make Suisun his headquarters. The
, quantity of dried fruit this year will be
]i s^ than in former years, but Mr. Lueh
l nlng expects, nevertheless, to increase his
: shipments to foreign markets this year.
He said to-day that since the Hamburg
Exposition the demand for dried fruit had
| greatly increased in Germany and that
!an extensive market would be opened
! there in the near future for California
i products. Orders have been received this
week lor dried apricots ami three car
loads will be forwarded without delay.
TO ROUND UP A
DESPERATE BANDIT
Posse Searching for Tom
Ketchum.
LEADER OF A FAMOUS BAND
HAS ENGINEERED MANY TRAIN
ROBBERIES.
He Is in Hiding in Tom Green County
and the Officers Are Determined
to Take Him Dead or
Alive.
Ppecia! Dispatch to The Call.
AUSTIN. July 2S.â Tom Ketchum, the
most notorious train robber, murderer and
bandit leader known in Texas, is about to
be rounded up in Tom Green County by
a posse of State Rangers and Deputy
X'nlted States Marshals, according to re
liable official information received here
to-day from that section.
Tom'Ketchum and his band have plotted
and carried out successfully more train
robberies than any other brigands who
ever operated in the Southwest. In addi
tion to holding up and robbing the Fort
Worth and Den%*er City passenger train
near Folsom, N. M., recently they have
committed a dozen other equally as des
perate robberies in Texas, Now Mexico
and Arizona during the last four years.
Tom Ketchum is a brother of Sam Ketch
um. who was shot and fatally wounded
in the fight with officers in New Mexico
a few days ago. Tom was In that fight
and the officers say that it was his rapid
firing and unerring aim that did so much
deadly work in their own ranks on that
occasion. After that light the band sen
arated and Tom and two of his men made
their way to their old rendezvous in Tom
Green County.
Their presence in the vicinity of San
Angelo became known to the officers of
that county four days ago, and steps were
Immediately taken to effect their capture.
Four rangers who were ordered there
from San Sana. County and several deputy
United States Marshals are close on their
trail, and it is expected that the final
round-up will occur to-morrow.
Tom Ketchum was raised In San Saba
County, near here. He has wealthy and
highly respected relatives living in South
west Texas. He entered his career as a
leader of a train rubbers gang about lour
years ago. One of their first notable rou
beries was at LoEler, Texas, when they
held up the California passenger train on
the Southern Pacific road and secured
about $40,000 from the through sal
Wells, Fargo & Co. State Rangers and
deputy United States Marshals were soon
on the scene and purued the band through
the roughest part of West Texas for a
distance of four hundred miles. At the
New Mexico line the band separated and
Tom Ketchum returned to Tom Green
County, but the exact location of his
rendezvous there could never be found:
A short time afterward the band got
together again and robbed an Interna
tional ami Great Northern passenger train
near Austin. A few months later they
committed the robbery of the Texas and
Pacific passenger train near Coleman,
Texas. They secured a large amount of
money from the express company in the
latter robbery. Ketchum participated In
this latter robbery, but it is thought that
few of the remaining members of his des
perate gang were connected with it. Tom
Ketchum then fled to New Mexico, where
he committed other successful train rob
beries. Texas officers who are acquainted
with Ketcnum's record claim that he
never belonged to the "Black Jack" gang.
He baa th< reputation of being a dead
shot with a Wln< luster and pistol. It is
conservatively estimated that Ketchum
and his band have secured over $100.u0Q
from the express companies within the
past four years.
PRESIDENT JORDAN
BACK FROM COLORADO
Stanford Educator Pleased With the
Success of the Recent Teachers'
Convention.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, July 2*.â ;
President David Starr Jordan returned to- I
day to the university from Colorado. Dur-
Ing his trip he attended the meeting of
the National Educational Association in ;
Los Angeles, and was one of the principal i
speakers before the Texas-Colorado Chau
tauqua Association at Boulder, Col. While
In Colorado Dr. Jordan was royally enter
tained by the Rocky Mountain Cornell
Association, which gave a banquet in his
honor at the Albany Hotel, Denver. Dr.
Jordan reports having met some STale ni<-n
who expect to attend Stanford next year,
and who will add materially to Stanford's
strength upon the gridiron and diamond.
In regard to the meeting of the National
Educational Association and Us benefit*
to California President Jordan said:
"The meeting of the National Kduca- j
tional Association at Los Angeles was â 
the most successful in its history. The
meeting will have two very Important ef
fects. In the first place, it has given 11,000
teachers, mostly or the East, a better un
derstanding of California and what it is,
and of the reasons why Califomians are
so proud of their State. On the other 'â .
hand it does California a great deal of
good to have so many bright minds from 1
the older States turned loose within her
borders."
President Jordan leaves on Saturday fnr '
Kings River Canyon, where he will spend
the month of August camping. He will
be accompanied by Mrs. .Jordan and by
Professor and Mrs. Elwood I\ Cubberley.
THOUSANDS OF CARP
IN A CLOSED SLOUGH
Tons of the Fish Will Be Left to Die
by the Evaporation of the
Water.
STOCKTON, July 28.â Thousands, seem
ingly millions, of carp are impriPoned in
a closed slough near Fishermans Landing,
on Union Island. It Is a sight worth go
ing miles to see. The fish were deposited
in the slough during the high water, and
when the river went down they were all
left on the wrong side of the levee. The
slough is about thirty feet wide, averag
ing three feet in depth and fully a half
mile long. The fish are so thick in the
place that they can hardly swim about.
They swim on the surface in such num
bers that they could be thrown out on
the bank In a scoop shovel by the wagon
load.
The water is rapidly evaporating un
der the torrid sun, which plays upon the
island, and the carp are growing bigger.
It is only a matter of a few weeks whÂ»n
they will be left in the open, dead and
decaying. Some of the fish have readied
a large size, nearly twenty inches in
length.
Eventually the fish will be left baking
in the sun and a stench will arise that
will call for heroic measures. The dead
fish make an excellent fertilizer, and this
is probably the use to which they will
be put.
Thn plough might be opened and the
fish turned back into the river, but the
opportunity to destroy so many of the
river pe.sts Is not one to be passed by the
people. The carp is valueless as a table
fish and they destroy many of the more
desirable inhabitants of the rivers and
channels.
Engineer Baird Killed.
LOS ANGELES. July 2K.â Word has

FREE PORT IS
UNSATISFACTORY
Canadian View of Boun
dary Dispute.
ARBITRATION IS DESIRED
TRADE WITH KLONDIKE CHIEF
CAUSE OF TROUBLE.
Many Canadians Believe That Seattle
Steamboat Men Have Had Much
to Say in the Nego
tiations.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
OTTAWA, Ontario, July 28.â Whatever
may be the ground for the optimistic dis
patches that have their origin in the State
Department and the British Embassy ai
Washington, neither party in Canada id
satisfied with the hints that England i 3
going to settle the boundary dispute out
of hand without reference to Ottawa and
accept the offer of a free port under
American sovereignty on the Lynn canal.
Canada may have to accept that very
thing in the end, but the suggestion that
she would have to do so would at this
time be very like dropping a can of nitre
glycerin on a brick pavement.
What Canada will be satisfied with, if
it cannot get arbitration, will be the ces
sion of a free port under British sov
ereignty at Pyramid harbor and also the
cession of a strip of territory ten or
tw< nty miles wide leading from Pyramid
harbor to the Canadian Klondike. In the
face of aroused public sentiment ringing
from one end of the Dominion to the
other no public man would dare stand up
and say ho was satisfied with what seems
to be under discussion at Washington.
The whole trouble just now Is over the
trade In the Klondike. Mining is carried
on almost entirely on Canadian territory.
Mr. Sifton, Minister of the Interior, esti
mates the number of American miners at
90 per cent. Sir Charles Tupper estimates
it at 60 per cent.
Tn the opinion of many Canadians Seat
tle steamboat men have dominated all
negotiations and prevented a compromise.
The Premier's figures show that Seattle
alone has 80 per cent of the carrying
trade. The proposition of Canadians to
build a railroad from Kltimat Harbor,
skirting the disputed strip, into Dawson
City, is made in dead earnest. One has
only to figure the cost to realize how
deeply Canada is stirred. Such a railroad
would have to be subsidized for at least
$5000 a mile. It would be 700 miles long.
Thus, in order to accomplish what was
Bought to be accomplished by the recent
negotiations, Canada will spend $3,500,000.

TO THE CREDIT
OF SEARCHLIGHT
Fast Heat Paced at
Cleveland,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CLEVELAND. Ohio, July 2*.â Search
light, In addition to winning the 2:04 race
from Anaconda and Frank Bopash. placed
a now mark to-day for the frlenville track
â2:03%. It was the fastest mile that has
ever been made in harness on the Cleve
land track. The great son of Dark Night
did it in one of the warmest heats that
has been seen in many a day.
Another mark was fixed by The Maid,
when in the second heat of the 2:14 pace
she went the mile in 2:04&, breaking the
record of 2:07^4 for four-year-old pacing
mares in races, made by Much Better at
San Jose last August. The track record
at Glenville was 2:03*4, held by Frank
A gaii.
The fourth day of the races presented
the best programme so far this week, the
Btar attraction being the fast pacing race.
It proved to be in every way as interest
ing as it was advertised to be. With the
horses in good condition they made good
time, and Searchlight knocked the opinion
of the bookies endwise, winning the race
they had scheduled for Anaconda,
Cresceus was the disappointment in the
2:10 trot. After winning one heat he was
hardly heard of except in a wonderful
drive in the last heat. The race went to
Klloree, who got better as the race pro
gressed, and finally won from Tommy
Britton and Cresceus.
A peculiar stat>' of affairs existed with
the 2:14 pace. The Maid was the favorite,
but Will Tranby was placed most against

FORBES WINS ON A FOUX.
Rotchford Strikes the Chicago Man
Below the Belt.
CHTCAGO. July 28.â A repetition of the
fOU] blow that lost for Billy Rotchford
in his fight with Pedlar Palmer in Eng
land a few months ago lost for him again
to-night in the lirst round of a boxing con
test with Harry Forbes of Chicago. The
blow caught Forbes in the stomach just
above the groin, knocking him flat on
his back. He did not regain consciousness
for nearly a half hour.
Both men started out at a fast pace,
Forbes having a shade the better of it
until the accidental blow was struck
Forbes had straightened Rotchford up
with a left jab and came rushing in with
his risnt. Rouhford tried to uppercut
with his right, but Forbes, stepping up
close, caught the blow in the stomach. .
TAYLOR'S FAST MILE.
Paced by a Motorcycle, He Covers
the Distance in 1:32 2-5.
CHTCAGO. July 28.â Major Taylor,
paced by the steam motor cycle, rode a
mile on the Ruvenswood track to-night
in 1:32 2-5. The motor cycle, which is a
rather complex affair, went wrong in its
insides a dozen times before it was patch
ed up sufficiently to make the pace.
The macnine and Taylor started from
the farther stretch and by the time they
had reached the tape they were going like
the wind. Taylor tacked himself close
to the rear wheel, and, fast as the ma
chine went, he stayed with it. The quar
ter was made in :22 1-5, world's time. The
half was made in :44 1-5, also record time.
The three-quarters was a second Blower,

ARRIVES WITH A
MILLION IN GOLD
FROM THE NORTH
The Steamer St. Paul Drops
Anchor in the Stream at
Midnight.
The Alaska Commercial Company's t
steamer St. Paul arrived from St. Mi
chael shortly before midnight last night j
and anchored in the stream.
The St. Paul brought down about 250
passengers, most of whom were miners.
It is estimated that the total amount of
gold on board the steamer will reach close
to the million mark. Of this amount sev
era] hundred thousand dollars is the
property of Messrs. Erickson and Hunt,
two of the best known men on the Klon
dike. The passengers aboard the St. Paul
bring discouraging reports from the Cape
Nome district. They say that the gold â 
there is hard (to find and of a poor j
quality.
The St. Paul left St. Michael on the j
ISth . and made an unusually fast trip )
down.
Two passengers died on the voyage, one
a Frenchman named Israel Desrosiera, j
who died of scurvy, and the other a miner ,
named J. A. Fischer, who had been in the !
Klondike region for several years, died or
locomotor ataxia. The St. Paul will dock
this morning.
SEVERE WINDSTORM
SWEEPS ST. MICHAEL
ST. MICHAEL, July 28.â The most se
vere summer windstorm seen here in
many years swept over this bay yester
day from early morning until nearly mid
night. Boats anchored in the â¢ stream
were torn from their fastenings and
either swept ashore or sent flying si-a
ward. The direction of the wind was
southeast. Fortunately no lives were lost,
as the majority of the vessels wrecked
were small steamers, built in 1597 for the
Koyokuk rush and which since early
spring have been idle at anchor in the
bay.
Their owners In many instances have
either gone to Cape Nome or Golovin Bay,
giving up all hope of selling or leasing
their vessels. The damage will amount
to many thousands of dollars. Beginning
about 6 o'clock in the morning, the ve
locity of the wind Increased until it ap
proached a hurricane at noon. Ocean
craft and large river steamers tugged at
their ponderous anchors firmly rooted in
the mud, but try as he would the storm
king was unequal to the task and turned
attention to the smaller fry with great
success, as the beach for several miles
will testify.
The point of land on which the Alaska
Commercial Company's plant is built got
the full benefit of the wind and consider
able damage would have occurred had
though the major could have gone faster
he was not pushed. The time was too
slow to allow the record to come to Illi
nois, for the last quarter was made In :25.
When Taylor realized that more speed
was necessary he started to spurt and in
the homestretch he had gained the length
of thi- motor cycle and finished a yard to
the good. This record is the best ever
made in the "West.
McFADDEN AND GANS DRAW.

John White called a draw. A majority of
the 5000 persons who packed the audito

the colored lad from the southern city had
made a better showing, but the contest
had been so fast and interesting that
cheers alone greeted the close and the

SOUTHERN PACIFIC
NEEDS FOREIGN TALENT
ATTORNEY C. STEEUE IMPORTED
FROM NEW YORK.
Herrin, the Mysterious, has evidently
found that the burden he is called upon
to bear as attorney for the Southern Pa
cific Company Is more than his frail and
sensitive nature can easily support. There
fore he has called in some one to help
â him. That some one is Charles Steele- of
the firm of Seward, Guthrie & Steele, law
yers of New York. It is not exactly plain
what particular portion of the Herrin bur
den Steele is retained to assume, but,
judging from the secrecy that is thrown
around his advent into this city and the
amount of work that is being done by his
stenographer by the aid of gaslight In
suite 50 of the fifth floor of the Palace Ho
tel, It Is evident that the aforesaid Steele's
share of th* load is to be of no small pro
portion.
When the Southern Pacific Company
start to import an extra attorney into
this State they do it in good style. In the
case of Steele, Mr. Herrin and a private
car were sent on to Denver to meet him
Nothing w|ts said in either the Denver
or the Salt Lake papers about the coming
together of these judicial stars, though
the incident was- of sufficient significance
to cause some comment. The reason for
this silence is possibly better known to
Herrin and the publishers of the papers
than anybody else. However, Mr. Her
rin secured his wise men from the East
and. carefully hiding him from the prying
eyes of reporters, whisked him into 'thfs
city yesterday morning behind the drawn
curtains of his private car, attached to a
local train.
Arriving at the Palace Hotel no less
secrecy was maintained. Mr. Steele was
given suite 50, on the fifth floor, without
having to undergo the formality of reg
istering. His baggage was sent up im
mediately afterward for fear that the
trunks might excite the curious specula
tion of the passerby. All these precau
tions proved futile, however, as it was
nut a short time before it was whispered
around that there was "something doin\"
and a reporter going to the desk inquir
ing of. the clerk as to which room Steele
not the greatest care been taken; as it
was the company lost its lately acquired
tugboat, the Anna Eva Fay, purchase!
last winter at Unalaska. and nearly lost
the fine large river steamer Margaret,
which was swept to sea several miles be
fore m-r captain could get her about.
The Margaret had a successful trip to
the troopship St. Paul, which also belongs
to the Alaska Commercial Company, ana
with a number of passengers aboard
started for the dock about noon. As sha
cast loose from the steamer the wind
caught her square astern and sent her
flying seaward. At that point it was use
less to attempt to put her about, and for
about ten miles she went along faster
than she lias ever gone before. The St.
Paul passengers and several of the crew
were almost washed overboard. During m
temporary lull she put about, and after
fighting the head wind she was driven into
a cove a mile from St. Michael and an
chored there for the night.
The stern-wheeler City of Paris, lately
purchased by the Alaska Exploration
Company, snapped her anchor chain and.
drifted rapidly to sea with two watchmen
aboard. Ah soon as possible the St. Paul
got under way and went to the res
cue, overtaking the Paris about ten
miles out. Owing to the high wind
and choppy sea, it was difficult t<>
get a line to the Paris, but this was finally
accomplished and the stern-wheeler pulled
back to port.
The tug Anna Eva Fay dragged her an
chor opposite the Alaska Commercial
Company's wharf and drifted on the rock 3
a few feet astern of the river steamer
Louise, which was firmly tied to the
wharf. All efforts to get the Fay off were
In vain, and she pounded to pieces in a,
few hours. The river steamer Dorothy.
owned by James Deitrieh, dragged her
anchor and went ashore, but there are
hopes that she can be saved. Along th<Â»
beach several other small steamers ai. i
numerous sloops and Yukon River boats
are total wrecks. Among the wrecked
craft i.s the steamer William MeKinl* y.
The river steamer Ana Wanda is smashed
to bits. _ _ ,
The May West and the . Seig are
also on the rocks. One of the fine new
barges belonging to the Alaska Explora
tion Company was blown to sea with a
Captain Brant and mate of the four
masted schooner Carrier Dove, while try
ing to row to the wharf, were upset, but
were pulled out, narrowly escaping
drowning. __
News of the storm at Cape Nome is
anxiously awaited. The barrenness of the
I. each upon which the city of Nome is
built and the high surf that conttnua y
rolls in will make the storm unusually
fatal to shipping. With such a wind as
prevailed here none of the dozen vi
| anchored off the city could have es-
| caped.
was occupying, that functionary said that
there was" no guest by that name in the
hotel. However, Herrin was later seen
coming out of Steele's apartments.
A subsequent inquiry of Mr. Herrin a=j
to the business of Mr. Steele in this city
brought thn rather astonishing answer
from Herrin that he "knew no such per
son as Steele at all." Be that as it may,
the fact remains that these two gentle
men nave been in close consultation on.
some scheme or other which, whatexer it
may be. is of sufficient importance to
keep a stenographer busy at his desk un
til tho "wee sma' hours" of the morning.
The stenographer, when seen at I
o'clock this morning, said; "Yes, Mr.
Steele did come out here in a private car.
But hp is not on business. Oh. no. He 13
merely making a summer tour of the dif
ferent points of interest on the coast."
The stenographer did not come with,
him. Steele just picked him up en route
as he was crossing a desert with his type
writer under his arm. Stople liked his*
looks and asked him to make the tour
with him. The stenographer was not em
ployed by Steele. He was merely working
at 1 o'clock in the morning because ha
hated to be idle.

The Moana spoke the Mariposa, which |
left here on June 13 at 1 a. m. The!
steamer was slowed down, as Captain j
Havward had not been able to take an j
observation for two days, owing to the !
sun being completely hidden by the smoke J
that arose from the volcano on the -land
of Hawaii. Captain Carey saw the smoke I
in the heavens when the Moana was a '
thousand miles away from the scene. â  |
The Moana brings the news that the ;
ship Hawaiifan Isles, owned in San. Fran- i
ciÂ«co. had a hard time of it during the j
voyage from Chemanius, B. C. to Mel
bourne with lumber. On May 2S she was
caught in a hurricane. All the sail was
off the vessel with the exception of the !
fore and main lower topsails.. But even '
these proved to be too much.' a squall I
struck the ship and at the same time-. a j
huge wave broke over the starboard Quar- j
ter. It carried away the lashings of the
deckload and considerable of the lumber :
was washed overboard. Stanchions were
broken.' the bulwarks forward of the
mizzen mast were bulged out. the bridge â¢
and the topgallant bulwarks were washed '
away and the fore lower topsail was torn
Into ribbons. The Hawaiian Isles finally
reached port without any more mishaps. i
The four-masted British bark Otterburn
arrived at Sydney. S. S. \V.. while the
Moana was "there with the shipwrecke-i
crew of the Italian bark Maria C aboard:
The Otterburn was from Xew York, and
on March 20 Captain Benson saw the dis
tress signals flying from the wreck of the
Maria C. It was blowing a gale, but not
a moment was wasted in heading the
Otterburn for the sinking bark. A boat
was lowered, and. after many narrow es
capes from destruction Captain Seotto (M
Uccio ar.d ten of his crew were rescued.!
As sc-on as they found themselves in
safety on the deck of the Oti-:rburn they
fell on their knees and returned thanks to
Providence for their deliverance. None
of them could talk English, so they signed
â¢ to Captain Benson that there were still
two lives on the sinking craft. One of
the ship's boats was again lowered and
manned and the crew just got it alongside
the Maria C in time to take off a dog and
a cat before the vessel went down. Soon
after ' this i an Italian vessel bound for
Europe was spoken, but the captain re
fused point blank to take his countrymen
home, so Captain Benson had to take
them on to Australia. The Maria C was
bound from Marseilles for Portuguese
Central Africa, but was caught in a series
of gales and would have taken her crew
down with her in another hour had not
the Otterburn come along.

THE SAN FBASCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JULY 29. 1899.
MURDER IS THE
CHARGE MUSCAT
IS NOW FACING
Killing o. c Miss De
Sanchez Retold.
THREE WITNESSES EXAMINED
THE ACCUSED LISTENS TO THEM
CALMLY.
Strong- Probability the Defense Will
Try to Shift the Blame of
the Deed to De
ceased.
Ellas Muscat, the sailor accused of
shooting and killing Sophia B. de Sanchez
on July 2 in the grocery at 301 Broadway,
had his preliminary examination before
Police Judge Mog-an yesterday afternoon.
He was represented by Attorney J. N. E.
Wilson.
The tragic story connected with the
alleged murder is still fresh m the public
mind. Muscat was consorting with the
deceased for me months before her
death and was madly jealous of her. He
met her in the grocery at 11 lock on
July 2. and ... pair had had a
stormy row N. Blanken. who Is "the pro
prietor of the place, heard several pistol
shots. He went into the bar of the
grocery and found Miss de Sanchez lying
on the floor, dead. The defendant en
deavored to shoot â¢ â¢ self, and had a
smoking pistol in his hand, but Blanken
grappled /with him and manaeed to ob
tain possession of the revolver. The ar
- -â¢ of Muscat followed, â -â 'â â  he was
thereafter held to answer to a charge of
murder by the Coroner's Jury.
The witnesses called by the prosecution
yesterday were Peter* Casaviello. N.
B'.ar.ken'and Dr. J. I- Zabala. the physi
cian who performed the autopsy for the
Coroner. Th^ir testimony was exactly in
line with that grfven before the Coroner.
Casavieilo stated that Muscat and the
deceased had lived ii his lodging house
at I3HH& Stockton street for several weeks
before the alleeed murder. They had fre
quent rcws, and defendant one time when
crunk said to witness that he would kill
th* deceased.
N. Blanken, the owner- of the store
where the murder was committed, de
scribed how he heard the shots fired in
the rear of his establishment; his discov
ery of the deceased and his successful
stfugri- with the defendant to obtain the
revolver.
Dr. Zabala went over the gruesome de
tails of the autopsy. The effective bullet
had entered through the mouth and into
the brain. The bullet was called for. Dr.
Zabala had forgotten to bring it with him.
and an abrupt continuance was taken
until next Tuesday at 11 o'clock, when the
bullet will be presented as an exhibit in
the case.
Muscat is a stout, stolid German with
a pitsasant face, who hardly approximates
the traditional idea of the low-browed
murderer. Yesterday's testimony did not
?eem to affect his composure, although
he listened to it all attentively.
The plan of his defense has not been
made ciear by the tactics of his attorney
â cross-examination, although some of
the questions asked yesterday would seem
to indicate that an attempt will be made
to prov-=> that the deceased attempted to
shoot Muscat, or else that he accidentaliy
shot the d.-'c^ased while she was strug
gling with him to secure the pistol and
prevent him from killing himself. These
theories, in the face of the evidence
brought out by the testimony taken be
fore the Coroner's jury. seem hardly ten
able, however, ar.d it" looks as though
Muscat will have a hard legal run for his
life by and by.

DEATH OF A FORMER
CONSUL OF SWEDEN
FM. PETERSEN of the firm of F.
M. Petersen & Co.. brokers and
I agents for the San Juan and
Qulntera mining- companies, died
yesterday morning: at his residence at
1203 Golden Gate avenue quite sudden
ly. Frederick Meredln Peterson wa-3
born in Hamburg in :â¢--: .- â¢ about 23
or 24 years of ac he went out to the
city of Vera Cruz. Mexico, where he
became a partner in a firm engaged
extensively In the Importation of Man
chester cottons, German and French
dry goods, etc. After carrying on a
large business for many years Petersen
retired from the firm, their operations
having 1 been rendered unprofitable
through the depreciation in Mexican
silver. In Vera Cruz he married the
eldest daughter of the late Dr. Trow
*- :_- who was for many years
United State? Consul in that city.
Peter?en himself was for a long time
Consul General of Sweden and Norway
at Vera Cruz, and for his services re
ceived from King Oscar the decoration
of the Swedish order of Wasa. After
leaving VÂ«ra Cruz be accompanied Dr.
â - -,%--â  ..- and his family to Decatur.
111., and thence came to California,
where the doctor settled at N'apa.
Owing to his Intimate knowledge of Mexican affairs and the Spanish lan
guage be became agent in San Francisco for the San Juan Mining Company
of Las Flores. Lower California." and for the Quintera Mining Company of Los
Alamos, In the State of Sonora, Mexico. He also carried on the business of a
custom-house broker. Two years ago. owing to an affection of the throat, he
lost his voice and underwent the operation of tracheotomy, which was to a
certain extent successful. In fact, he advanced so far on the road to recov
er}' that the silver tube which had been Inserted in his throat was removed,
and on Thursday he went down to hie office, at 506 Battery street, and ar
ranged to be there again yesterday morning. On Thursday evening he ate a
good dinner and played some games of billiards. After retiring to bed the peo
ple in the house were aroused by a scream, and entering his room found him
tearing off a bandage from his throat. He expired almost at once in the pres
ence of his wife and the landlord of the house at about 12:30 a. m. yesterday.
His sudden decease will be much regretted by many friends. He had no chil
dren, and his widow has for some time resided with her own family at Napa.
For several years he was associated with Fred Holmes, the ship broker, who
recently went to England to establish his claim to an estate known as Rain
hi!l Tlal! rear LivemOOl.

"Bis; Jack" Fitzgerald, head bookkeeper;
in the Sheriff's office under "VVhelan's ad- S
ministration and recently discharged from i
Assessor Dodge's employ, is the latest !
City Hall employe to go wrong with the â â 
money brokers. It was discovered in the i
Auditor's office yesterday that he had hy- !
pothecated his August warrant for ISC '5 |
with four different money lenders, realiz- j
ing by the transaction something over J

take they have not ... but it is |
likely to be nothing of a more serious na- j
ture than civil process, as it has been j
proved before that there is no law to sus- j
tain a criminal action in such cases.
Fitzgerald has been a unique figure in
Democratic politics for some years past.
His rise to political standing was as sud
den as it was surprising From the posi
tion of page at the Hammarh baths he ;
jumped to the dignity of one of the lead-
Ing lieutenants of the Democratic bosses
h.< well as to prominence in National
Guard affairs. His interest in military mat
ters and his political influence have twice
taken him to the Legislature in the inter- ;
est of National Guard legislation, in which
he has usually been successful. The con
nections he has made, however, have been
of a somewhat expensive character, and it :
is said he has lived a month or so ahead
of his income for some time.
His latest transgression is not his first.
He was mixed up in a similar affair while
bookkeeper under Sheriff Whelan. Short
ly before "Pete" McGlade took his sensa
tional slide down the political toboggan
Fitzgerald was found to be over $!â¢Â» short'
In his accounts, and all that saved him at ;
that time was his ability to make it good
when called upon to do so by the Auditor.
The shylocks who will suffer by his
overdraft in this case are Bier & Riegens

A NEW HUMANE MOVE.
Pasture for Old Horses and Home for
Stray Dogs.
The ladies of the Society for the Preven
tion of Cruelty to Animals are meeting
with great success In organizing the
Bands of Mercy, the movement finding
special favor among- the children of the
public schools. From what has been ac
complished it is believed that within a
very short time every pupil of these
schools will be enrolled with the bands.
At a meeting of the society an interest
in? paper was read by Miss McGraw
which give* some idea of the aims and
objects of the organization, and suggest
ing the introduction of a decidedly novel
feature of humane work in this city. She
said in part:
The Bud of Mercy i 3 to the Society P. C.
A. what the Sabbath-schooi Is to the church,
and it Is became the society realized its pow
erleÂ«sn^ss to reach all cases and all .onus
of cruelty to animals that It has tasen up
thl* form of "humane education. hoping
much in future from the children of the pres
ent ' Th- society has long realized that the
greatest number of cases of cruelty to animals
with which it has to deal are cases arislnsr
from ignorance and thoughtlessness on the
-art of the persons committing the cruei
acts.. We recognize the fact that If we are
going to these children with theories they
re going to examine us to see if we are liv
ing up â¢-, these theories.
It 1<Â« said that the women members of the
society must turn to thetr brother members
about the coursing, the pigeon shooting . and
the vivisection arising in our midst, because
thesÂ« things must be fought and we have long
been told that women must not "fight." so
we appeal to the men of the society to put
down these things and we will educate the
children, open a pasture for tired, overworked
horses and a home for stray dogs. Now this
matter of the pasture and of the home for
dogs is net an impractical idea at all. The
work Is being done in England and to some
extent in the United States, there being a
number of societies P. C A. that have homes
for dogs. But the San Francisco society has
the chance to have the* name, the fame and
the honor of being the first society in tbfl
Vnlted States to - .-â  a pasture for the tired,
overworked, faithful, long-neglected horses.

The San Francisco and San Mateo Rail

expected to attend the Pacific Turn
Bezirk. which will be held at Glen Park
the last two days of this month. The
double track of the road has been fin
ished to Glen Park, into which it runs.
Four very large cars have been received
from the General Electric Company. These
cars will furnish a novelty to the coast
on electric brakes, which re the latest
and most powerful brakes in existence.
While they are very much more expensive
than the other brakes they .are exception
ally effective.
Ten smaller cars have also been ob
tained. As it is not necessary to use eiec
trie brakes on these cars the regulation
brakes have been used. These additions
to the service and the laying of the
double track insure adequate transporta
tion facilities for the big fete day.

MOBS AND MORMONISM.
THE Mormon is a missionary church. Like its
more approved fellows in the family of sects,
it feels the impulse of a mission to carry its re
vs cult among the Gentiles. To this end it sends
every year to several ends of the earth zealous
preachers to spread the doctrines of the Book of Mor
mon. As this is regarded as a sort of third testament,
the Bible is used with it and companion texts are
driven tandem at the heart of the sinner.
At present several of the-..' missionaries are spread
: c word in Georgia, and. as they seem skilled and
artful, they make some converts and promise to trans
i '.ant many vines to the vineyard of the saints and to
bring back to Zion many pious and some buxom evi
dences of their fidelity to their church. But no mis
iry from the time of St. Paul has got on without
tribulation, and these Mormon brethren are no excep-
tion. In Jasper County, Georgia, they were flourish
â  that promised many additions to the
ri mately three of them tripled teams
rt Mrs. Cunnard. The lady was not unwilling
to listen, but while the missionaries were enlightening
her about the Archangel Moroni and the other celes
menibers of their side show, up rode fifty masked
men and a^-ked them to come out and take a ride.
They refused and asked a parley. The narrative of the
n at this point introduce? Mr. Cunnard. accom
panied by a rirle. Then tilings became confused. Sev
eral shots were exchanged and Mrs. Cunnard had her
jaw -haltered. The elders were captured and taken
away, but, according to the latest reports managed to
make their escape in a badly bruised condition by
swimming a creek.
A- Mr-. Cunnard's jaw is shattered she will not be
heard from at pre-ent. We have no doubt that Mr.
Cunnard is glad it is no worse, and as long as she had
to be shattered somewhere rejoices it was in her jaw.
He is thereby assured, for some time, of that domes
tic quiet which is necessary to a Christian gentleman
who stands guard over the religious principles of his
family with a gun.
Such occurrences, by no means infrequent, raise
some interesting questions. American missionaries,
of the standard and approved churches, are sent into
far and heathen lands to preach their Christianity to
natives to whom it is no less novel and revolting than
is Mormonism in Georgia. If these natives, in their
heathen blindness, do lo^s than was done to the Mor
mons in Georgia, our Government is appealed to and
indemnity is demanded ?.nd, if need be, secured under
a threat of war.
The situation of the Mormons, especially, is pecu
liar. Considered merely as one of the numerous
forms of religion, it is entitled to toleration with the
rest. Its polygamous feature has revolted the moral
conscience, and the mass of our people have approved
most drastic legislation to punish its practice. But in
the same day's news that tells of the effort to prevent
the conversion of Mrs. C'urnard, we read of negotia
tions of our Government with the Sultan of Sulu. who
advises his Mahometan subjects that the United States
will protect them in the enjoyment of both polygamy
and slavery, two institutions that are of immemorial
existence in the Sulu Islands.
It may bother the plain mind to reconcile the ex
istence of the twin relics of barbarism, polygamy and
slavery, and the legal punishment of Mormon plural
ity of wives, under the jurisdiction of the United
States. This taken with the mobbing of Mormon mis
sionaries and the fracture of Mrs. Cunnard's jaw in
Georgia, while we are ready to fight if an American
missionary is harmed in China, presents a complexity
of policy and habit and practice, which illustrates the
whimsicalities which attend upon our appearance as a
world power.
It is noted by the street railway men of Brooklyn
and Cleveland that strikes on their lines do not hurt
as bad as they did in the day when the cars were
drawn by horses. In former strikes the companies
had a great deal of expense in feeding the idle horses
and getting them duly exercised, but now when the
strike comes they just shut off the dynamo and wait
for developments.
SLAVERY COMING OGAIN.
THE imperial experiment of Great Britain is
about to break down because it does not pay.
Her West Indian possessions have been an ex
pense since she -abolished African slavery there. Her
tiopical holdings cannot be made to yield except
under forced or servile labor.
The United States is entering the same field, leav
ing behind our constitutional declaration against
slavery and involuntary servitude, which followed the
Civil War and Lincoln's emancipation proclamation.
We have Hawaii, and there under our flag are main
tained practices and a labor system opposed to our
| constitution and laws, and foreign to our domestic
! policy. Involuntary servitude is the only means by
| which tropical labor can be secured, and when it
| ceases in Hawaii production and profits cease with it.
iln the Philippines all surplus producing labor is
j forced or servile, and if we take that diseased part
of the world into our system we must get profit out
! of it by continuing that form of labor.
It is evident that the straits in which British im
perialism .rinds itself and the necessities of American
imperialism, together are starting a revival of the
institution of chattel slavery. A work has just been
issued on the subject, discussing the ethnological
status of the negro. It is written by a clergyman,
printed in parts in a church paper in Pennsylvania
and issued from the printing house of the Lutheran
denoiujnation in Philadelphia. It is indorsed by
doctors of divinity and by presiding elders, and is
an appeal, in the name of God, of course, to the pious
everywhere, to consider chattelhood as the divinely
appointed status of the dark races. In his conclusion
and the clinch of his argument the reverend author
says: "The ways of God are always consistent, when
understood, and always just and reasonable. It is a
curious fact, but- a fact, nevertheless, and fully sus
tained by Scripture as well as by history, and that
fact is t hi- : that Gad never conferred and never de
signed to confer, any great blessing on the human
family but what he always selects or has selected .i
descendant of the Adam, holding slaves, or a white
nation holding slaves, as the by or through
which that blessing should reach them. Why He has
done so is not material to discuss now; but the fact
that He always did so the Scripture abundantly
proves. Also there is the suggestive truth that the
Shepherding church is nearest Abraham, the father
of the faithful in whose seed all the families of the
earth were to be blessed, and Abraham owned three
hundred and eighteen servants. And the Savior of
the world was of the Jewish, a white nation owning
servants and it held them by God's laws, not their
own.
"But what of our nation and government, the United
States? A government acknowledged by all nations
to be the most cosmoplastic of the nations to-day.
Who undeF God's providence organized and estab
lished it and its reformation principles? Let us appeal
to history. The first attack on British power and the
aggressions of Parliament was made by a slave-holder
from a slave State, Patrick Henry. The first President
of the first Congress that ever assembled on this
continent was a slave-holder, Peyton Randolph. The
Secretary of that Congress was a slave-holder, Charles
Thompson. The chairman of the committee of the
whole who reported the Declaration of Independence
was a slave-holder, Benjamin Harrison. The author
of the Declaration was a slave-holder, Thomas Jef
ferson. The Genera] of the Continental army was a
slave-holder. George Washington, who was also
President of the convention which framed the con
stitution. The father of the constitution was a slave
holder, James Madison.
"Whaterfr of peace, prosperity, happiness and glory
the people of the United States have enjoyed has been
under the administration of Presidents who were
slave-holders from slave States. Whenever the Presi
dent has been elected from a free State, from Adams
down to Lincoln, contusion, wrangling and strife have
been the order of the day. Why all this has been so
is not in the line of our subject, only this far, God
will not be mocked. He ordained that the negro
should be the servant of servants, solely. It is in the
Scriptures: to believe less than they contain is infi
delity, to believe more is superstition."
No wonder that in the theocratic revival that has
risen with American imperialism, this book is reach
ing a wide circulation. As it was in the beginning
so it is in the end. Whenever men have set out upon
a policy repugnant to human reason, revolting to the
conscience of man, involving slaughter, cruelty and
every abomination, members of the clerical class have
supported it and put the responsibility upon God.
The instances of this in the early history of the race
have been canonized and stand as the ancient prece
dents, gilded by an assumption of divine sanction,
The torture of witches, the slaughter of heretics, the
holding of slaves, the butchery of people who de
fend their homes from invasion, all have been un
loaded upon God and men have washed their hands
of the blood upon them in the waters of providential
approval!
Tt is so now with imperialism and the breach of
faith and broken promise that go with it. To-mor
row it may be so with the restoration of slavery, the
renewal of the horrors of the middle passage, and the
erection again of the abominations that follow the
chattel ownership of man by man.
NEGRO SENTIMENT ON IMPERIALISM.
A REPORT sent out a short time ago to the
effect that a movement had been started in
Boston to organize the colored men of the
country against imperialism has naturally been the
subject of much more consideration in the East than
or, this coast, but it is nevertheless one which merits
attention throughout the country.
The Washingon correspondent of the Philadelphia
Public Ledger has furnished to that paper the views
of a number of leading colored men at the national
capital on the subject. The statements show that j
while there are some objections to any attempt to i
organize the negroes on that issue there is a very
decided feeling among the eminent colored men of
the capital against imposing a Government upon the
Filipinos without their consent.
Professor Kelley Miller of Howard University is
quoted as saying:
"While I do not think the movement to organize
the colored people into aggressive opposition to the
political policies of the administration will amount to
very much, I doubt whether there is a single intelli
gent Afro-American in the country who has the heart
to condemn Aguinaldo and the cause he represents.
We hear much nowadays about the capacity of the
'backward' peoples for self-government. The truth i;
any people can govern themselves better than any
alien can do it for them, no matter how enlightened
the superior race may be."
Dr. C. B. Purvis, described as a "leader of thought
and action among the colored people of the city,"
said: "I am not in favor of expansion and know
very few of our people who are. The truth of the
matter is, we would dislike to see such a mistaken
policy put into practice over half-civilized races as has
been saddled upon the negro in this country." .
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY. JTJLY 29, 1899.
A. H. Grimke, a former Consul to Santo Domingo,
said:
"From my own observation I know that the expan
sion policy of the administration is very unpopular
with the negro. The absolute supineness of the Chief
Executive on the subject of negro lynchings makes
them shudder for other peoples who may come under
the yoke."
The imperialists have frequently met the public ob
| jections to sending our brave boys to the tropical
! climate of the Philippines to carry on a war against
guerrillas in pestilential jungles, by asserting that
negro troops could be relied upon to do the fighting
and make the conquest for us. Speaking of the senti
; ments of the negroes of the capital on that subject,
1 Mr. Grimke says:
"They feel no enthusiasm whatever for the succ*. s
of the American arms in the Philippines. Moreover,
they would rigorously oppose any attempt to send
colored troops to aid in carrying on the war against
the forces of Aguinaldo. The character of inferior
races is something with which Americans have little
patience, and it is impossible for them to be fair
toward them. We have racial problems enough at
home without undertaking more to add to them."
Thus collapses another of the pet projects of the
imperialists. The white volunteers prefer to come
home rather than to re-enlist for imperial service in
the Philippines, and now the negroes who were relied
upon to undertake the conquest refuse to volunteer.
They have no ardor in a war waged for imperial pur
poses.
BOfiRD OF HEALTH JOBS.
AUDITOR WELLS' decision to audit no salary
claims of the Board of Health for any other
than statutory officers and employes has wor
ried the board a good deal more than the famous dis
covery of the bacilli of the bubonic plague; for, while
the body is known as a Board of Health, the members
I of it by the favor of Gage and the push of Burns are
not in for their health. They stood with equanimity
the menace of the plague, but a decision which shuts
; off their patronage on the eve of a municipal cam
paign fevers their political pulses, gives them chills
in the feet and sends them howling to the courts.
The decision of the Auditor is, of course, right and
proper. He could have taken no other course since
the decision of the courts with reference to the test
case raised by the County Clerk. The two cases, of
course, are not exactly parallel, but they are sufli
i ciently alike to justify the Auditor in refusing to sanc
tion unlimited salary claims issued by the board.
The board claims the right to appoint as many offi
cers, agents and employes as it may deem necessary
to carry on its work. It is well known, however, that
if such right be conceded the board would soon have
en its payroll a host of sinecurists and superfluous
employes, drawing salaries from the county to do pol
: itics for political bosses. The Auditor has wisely de
termined to take no chances. He will audit only such
salaries as are clearly provided for by law, and the
i Board of Health can go to the courts to find out just
| how far it can exceed that limit in acting as a political
I machine to grind salaries out of the taxpayers for the
! members of the Burns push.
The decision of the Auditor is another evidence
of the awakened spirit of reform in the administration
of local finances. The lax system of the past, which
consisted mainly in "hefting" money., has given way
to a careful auditing and accounting. If the decision
of the Auditor be upheld by the courts a great relief
will be obtained for the public revenues. The reckless
, appointment of superfluous employes by the political
â  jobbers of the Board of Health will be checked and
the city will accomplish a marked advance not only
â¢ toward economy, but toward the breaking up of the
[ practice of using municipal and county offices as parts
i of the political machines that disgrace our politics.
THE ELECTION OF SENATORS.
SENATOR STEWART of Nevada announces
that for the purpose of putting an end to dead
locks in Senatorial elections and securing for
each State its full representation in the Senate, he
will propose a revision of the existing law so as 10
provide under certain contingencies for election by a.
plurality instead of a majority vote of the Legislature.
The suggestion is not a new one. A similar propo
sition was before the country last winter and was
widely discussed while the public mind was agitated
by the prolonged contests over Senatorial elections
in this and other States. The arguments for it and
those against it were fully reviewed at the time, and
while it is conceded that much can be urged in favor
of the change, the objections to it are insuperable.
Election by plurality vote will put *an end to dead
locks without entailing the long wait required for an
amendment to the constitution. To accomplish that
change nothing will be required but an act of Con
gress revising the Federal statute which now governs
such elections. That of course is a considerable ad
vantage, for it will take many years to bring about
a constitutional amendment, and in the meantime
deadlocks are liable to occur wherever a Senatorial
contest takes place.
The objection to the plan is that it would break
deadlocks in the interest of the corrupt forces rather
than in that of the better elements of our politics. In
every case where a deadlock occurred last winter it
was brought about by faithful representatives of the
people for the purpose of preventing the election to
the Senate of a political boss or an ally of bosses.
The deadlocks, therefore, while to some extent inju
rious, were necessary to prevent the infliction of far
greater injuries.
The only satisfactory solution of the problem is that
of a constitutional amendment providing for the elec
tion of Senators by a direct vote of the people. By
such an amendment we would get rid of the deadlock
and also of the corruption of legislators by the use
of money, by log rolling, by the distribution of State
patronage and by other and equally pernicious forms
of bribery.
From every point of view it is desirable to relieve
Legislatures of the work of electing United States
Senators. Even when there is no downright fraud
or corruption in the case, these contests disturb the
orderly process of legislative business, delay impor
tant measures and frequently prevent giving proper
consideration to issues 0/ considerable moment. Such
being the condition of affairs it would be better to
enter at once upon the task of amending the constitu
tion by providing for popular elections of Senators
than to tinker with the present statute and by getting
rid of deadlocks open the door for more and worse
jobbery than we have yet known.
According to General Gomez, the distribution of
$3,000,000 by our Government among fhe Cuban sol
diers has had no other effect than that of demoraliz
ing them. Instead of remaining in the ranks or going
home to work, they are hanging about the pay sta
tions clamoring for coin. Moreover, it is a safe pre
diction we will profit nothing by the disbursement.
The very men who get most of the money will be
first to denounce us when that is gone if we do not
,give them more.

PHILOPENA.
When Uncle Sam the Spanish nut so confidently cracked, '
In order (for humanity) Its kernel to extract,
He found that in the shell two kernels lay instead of one,
"Aha! a Philopena!" cried he, genially, in fun.
"We'll give and take, my lady." "Very well," Espagna said,
"I have eaten Filipinos all my life!" and tossed her head. *
Then she whispered to herself, "But they are something of a pest,
For I've found them not particularly easy to digest."
Now, Uncle Sam wan busy and forgot the little jest;
Santiago and Manila, then, were objects of his quest.
He took them. "Philopena! you've both won and lost this game.
And the forfeit you must pay me," quoth the crafty Spanish dame.
Now he has paid. the lady like an honorable man.
But he's tasting fruits of victory not foreseen when he began.

license under an assumed name he was
required to take oath that he would make
true answers to such questions as might
be asked him, and when he swore that
his name was that given by him he com
mitted perjury; and if any one feeling
Interested wished could have him arrested
at any time within three years after tak
ing the oath. If. however, the man
wishes to protect his wife and give her
his true name, he should marry her a
second time and preserve the records of
the first marriage.

A CLEAN CONVENTION
Assembly District Clubs Meet and
Perfect Organization.
Factional Fteht in Democratic Ranks -Fierce Contest
Between the Buckley Following and the Rainev-
Examiner Leagueâ Bosses Assailed.
CLUBS throughout the city are
making preparations for the pri
mary election on August S. at
which delegates will be chosen
for the municipal nominating
conventions of the respective political
parties. The Republicans will elect 305
delegates, the Democrats 334. the Peo
pie's party ~i. Socialist Labor party 36,
and the Citizens' Republican party 125
delegates.
The work in hand at the present time
relates chief.y to make up delegate
tickers in the various districts. Ir.
Democratic ranks there is a red hot
fight. Three factions are contending
: r ;he prize. The Democratic League of
Clubs, or the Buckley faction. Is putting
up a vigorous fight, in which the skill
of organization is displayed. The exec
utive committee of the Committee of
One Hundred is the directing agency
of another faction, known as the Re
form Democracy, of -which Gavin Mc-
Nab and Jasper McDonald are leaders.
The third faction is known as the
Rainey-Examiner L^acue. This com
bine derives its chief strength from the
Fire Department.
Disinterested spectators predict that
the Buckley clubs will elect more dele
pates than the clubs- of any other fac
tion will elect. Last night the repre
sentatives of the Buckley clubs met at
their general headquarter in the Bald
win Annex. They were enthusiastic
nd confident of success.
The Rainey-Examiner Leaeme is
working under cover and perhaps
working effectively. Leading Demo
crats are sent for and promised official
favor if they will stand in with the
Fire Department and Rainey. There
is not much activity at the headquar
ters of the executive committee of the
Reform Democracy, but the leaders
manifest the greatest confidence in the
ability of the organization to control
the convention.
Indications are that the Republicans
â will elect a convention representing the
best citizenship of San Francisco.
Since the boss scheme of a blanket
ticket was overthrown, the bosses have
cut but a small figure in the campaign.
Th^ clubs organized under the auspices
'of the Republican County Committee
are making a special effort to pet the
best men in each district placed on
the ticket for delegates. The Central
Republican Club, of -which Henry T.
Scott is president, has brought forward
many good men who have consented
that "their names shall be placed on the
ticket. The Affiliated Republican Clubs
are coins: good work in bringing for
ward men of character and ability, who
have EigTiiiied consent to serve as dele
pates to t!ie nominating convention.
The rivalry among Republican orsani
zatlons is in the direction of brir.sring
to the front the best men of the party.
The Assembly District Clubs, orzan
iz~d Friday evening of last week under
the auspices of the Republican County
CGmmlttee, met last night and elected
delegates to the Advisory Central Club.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JILT 29. 1899.
MILLIONS IN BONDS
WENT UP IN SMOKE
BURNING $2,500,000 OF WORTHLESS PAPER.
BONDS of the Oakland Water Company to thÂ« value of 12. 500 .000 went up
in smoke in the basement of the Union Trust Company building yes
terday afternoon. No loss resulted, however, other than the actual cost
of the paper and the â -â¢.-..- thereon. The destruction was made neces
sary on account of a legal defect In the issuance of a second 'series.
The bonds destroyed comprised two issues, the first being the orig
inal one of the Oakland Â«/ater Company of 1000 5 per cent gold bonds at a par
value of $1000 each, ..:â â â¢- ali. These were called in recently and
a new issue of $1.500.'Â») was Toted by the directors of the company. This last
Issue was guaranteed by the Contra Costa Water Company, but it appears
that there was a neglect to properly call the board of directors of the latter
concern providing for a meeting of the stockholders to guarantee the bonds.
The meeting took place with all the rectors present, but the legal oefect of
faulty notification was discovered by the attorney of the trust company before
the bonds were issued, thousrh the *- had already been signed by the officers of
the two water companies. This necessitated the issuanceof a new series, after
all the legal requirements had been complied with. **
The new bonds being in existence. It became necessary to cancel the de
fective issue, !n ... original issue which had been replaced; and
this was done by cremation to the satisfaction of all concerned. At the ap
pointed time William J. Dingee. president, and A. W. Rose, secretary of the
Oakland Water Company: A A. Watkinson. president of the Contra Costa
Water Company, and C. de Guigne, vice resident; and I. W. Hellman, secre
tary "of the Union Trust Company, gathered in the fire room. The 25*>J bond 3
were placed in the furnace, each oficiai taking a hand in consigning them to
the flames. The trust company was represented, inasmuch as the bonds were
secured by a deed of trust to the company is trustee, which certified that the
new bonds had been properly issued.
Eddy was elected permanent president,
W H Powers permanent vice president,
and John Hardy permanent secretary.
R^=n;utioris were adopted Indorsing t-.e
â visors for adhering: to the dollar
limit. It was also determine.! that the

Pattosien Returns.
W. J. Pattosien, the enterprising fur
niture dealer of the Mission, has re
turned from an extended business tour
of the East. He has visited all of the
manufacturing centers and states that
business is good with conditions im
proving constantly. He says the tide
is steadily setting toward the West and
in his judgment unusual activity will
soon be. manifest on the coast. Mr.
Pattesien visted the furniture exhibit
a: Grand Rapids, Michigan, where he
purchased many fine samples of fur
niture that were displayed there, as
v.ell as a stock of standard goods that
will require a train of twelve cars to
transport them. Mr Pattosien expects
the arrival of this train about Septem
ber 15.

A Big Chief Coming.
Thomas G. Harrison of Indianapolis,
publisher of the Indianapolis Bulletin, Is
on his way to California and will reach
this city next Monday. Mr. Harrison is
the great junior sagamore of the Great
Council of the Improved Order of Red
Men of the United States, the third high
est chief of the order. He is also great
chief of records of the Great Council of
Indiana and a past great sachem of that
council He will be here at the kindling
of the Great Council fire next week and
will ren'.ain several days.
the game from boyhood and are the pick of the men engaged in it, A year ago a third-rate
co" player visiu-d this city, and, using a wooden paddle, defeated "Jack" Bonnet, "Jim"
Nealon and other noted handball experts. The game requires a court 260 feet long, thirty
flve feet wide, and with a stone wall thirty-five feet high and five feet thick, against which
the ball is driven. Experiments have been made with a brick wall, but one of these
lasted only six days, owing to the fierceness of the play. The ball has a rubber
core and a leathern cover and is wound until much harder than a baseball. Two
players ai ged at one time on a side and, â  â¢â  Ing to the fierceness of the play, can stand
bui one game a day. They are limited to eight balls for a game, and frequently wear these
out. The prarnr is one "!' science, as the players, by a dexterous turn of the wrist, can per
form wondrous feats with the ball. The game is replete with surprises, every hit being a new
play. In Mexico it Is patronized by the most aristocratic people. A court is being built in
London, where the grame will shortly be introduced. A suitable court, can be constructed for
$20,000. It is possible the Olympic Club directors may arrange to Introduce the game here.

STEELHEODS IN
THE EEL RIVER
First Run of the Trout Is Un
usually Earlyâ Striped Bass
Attract Fishermen.
George Weymouth reports the first run
of the steelhead trout has entered Eel
River. On the i'id in.st. Mr. Weymouth's
son took six fish from Weymouth pool,
the largest of which weighed twelve
pounds. This appearance of the Bsh is
unusually early, but will please the fish
ermen who make an annual pilgrimage
to the river. Last year in September over
fifty men went from this city alone.
The striped bass still attract the fish
ermen to Sun Leandro Hay and the tidal
canal. Al dimming. J. K. Orr, A. W.
Wilson, \v. j. McFarland, O. R. Cross,
Colonel Kelihor, C. G. Foung and others
have been successful during the past
week, landing some large fish. W. W.
. Judge Henshaw and other trout
fishermen are anxious to try their skili
on tii.- bass. The lisli range in weight
from 3'Â» t<> 12 pounds, an average catch
being- about twenty Ash to a boat.
From Pelican Bay cuiks Information
that fishing with the spoon is remarkably
good. With the fly it is different, A. L.
Coombs saying that even clever anglers
have had indifferent success. The hotel
is thronged with anglers.
H. w. Keller, the new Fish and Game
Commissioner, arrived from his home in
Loa Aijgeles on Thursday. In company
with Chief Deputy J. P. Babcock he left
yesterday on a visit to the fish hatchery
â¢>n Eel River, Hurnboldt County, for the
purpose "f determining what alterations
will be necessary there. This is the sec

DEL MONTE WILL
DRAW GOLFERS
An Ambitious Programme Is
Being Arranged for the Last
Week, in August.
The week's carnival of ppnrts to take
; ace ..â  th Hotel del Monte from August
21 to 20 will include a golf tournament.
with contests for ladles and men. ihe
management baa offered a prize, to
led the I >â¢ > Monte cup, for competi
tion among th<- men, and the ladles will
contest for a trophy presented by George
Crocker. A committee of two reprea nta
i'-h of the golf clubs around
San Francisco will draw up the pro
:::<â  and arrange the conditions of the
competitions, it is expected that several
members of clubs In Southern California
will c..m'- up to Del Monte to take part
In th' t< urnament. C. E. Maud, president
of the Riverside Polo and Golf Club, is
desirous to arrange for a match betw< m
t< ams representing the north ar.fi south,
thirty-six holes, match play. He wishes
also to make arrangements for a compe
tition for the State championship between
the eight players making the best score
in the tournament.
Last Saturday afternoon there was a
nine-hole scratch and handicap tourna
ment for ladies at the links or the Ban
Rafael Golf Club. Mrs. \V. C. Bush won
the prize for best gross score with S4, and
.Mrs. J. F. Burke won the award for best
handicap score with a gross of 87 and a
net of 81.
The Council cup was an exhibition at
the clubhouse last Saturday and "will re
main there until after the first compe
tition for it, which will probably take
place on Admission day. The winner of
the competition will have his name en
graved upon the cup, and will receive a
small replica of it to keep permanently,
as the cup will not become the property
of any player until the .same person has
won it thrice.
A month ago Frank S. Johnson, at a
mooting of the council of the San Rafael
Â«; â !] Club, suggested the Idea of furnish
ing facilities for bathing. A week ago
sÂ« veral well-equipped bathhouses were
turned over to the members. They are
situated on an arm of the bay running
within two hundred yards of the golf
-â¢â¢. A salt water swimming pond bas
j already been provided and fresh water
Bhower baths will booh he added. Some
i time ago it was said that a railroad sta-
I tion would be erected near the links on
the line of the California Northwestern
' Railway. Up to the present it bas been
necessary to drive to the links from San
Rafael, but President Foster has deter
mined to put the new station in at an
; early date. It will be named Golf and
I will be a great convenience to golfers and
â  -visitors to the links.
The United States Golf Association has
recently amended section 9 of its by-laws
; which row reads as follows: "No person
shall be considered an amateur golfer who
i has played for a money prize in a match
, or in an open competition, or who has
received money for giving lessons or ex
hibitions of his skill in the game of golf;
or laid out or taken charge of golf links
for hire; or who has ever carried clubs
for lire after attaining the ace of l",
years; or who has ever personally made
I for sale golf clubs, bails or any other
' articles connected with the game of golf;
or who. after the adoption of this section
as amended, shall be classified as a pro
fessional in nay athletic sport." The last
clause disqualifying professionals in any
! sport is more strict than the British rule
I for it has been clearly stated by the"
: greens committee of the St. Andrew's Golf
; Club mat the fact of a man being a pro
fessional in another branch of sport in
no way disqualifies him from being an
amateur at golf. On the same principle
1 professional cricketers In Great Hritaia
| are eligible as members of an amateur
i hockey club or of an amateur football
! club. A professional player of football
has also been permitted to play county
I cricket as an amateur. On general prm
j ciples the latter seems to be the reason
â¢ able rule, for a man is an amateur of
whatever sport or occupation he engages
in !<>r love of it and not for gain. In the
United States, where amateurs and pro
fessionals are nor clearly marked from
1 each other by distinctions of class more
rigid oii'mitions are probably necessary
tlinn in Great Britain. The United States
Golf Association evidently adopts the
j maxim, a professional in one sport a pro
-1 fewslonal in all.
GOFF COULD NOT
GET TO WEIGHT
As a Sequence His Proposed Bout
With prank. McConnell Next
Thursday Is Off.
Charley Goff will not take Al Neill'a
place in the proposed boxing bout be
iwren the latter and Frank McConnell.
When McConnell and Goff met yesterday
to agree upon a match they found them
- at variance <>n th>' important mat
ter of weight. Goff would not make the
match unless allowed to weigh in at 158
pounds. As McConnell is down to 148 he
would not concede so great an advan
tage. The negotiations ended right there.
McConnell and Greun will meet this
morning and will endeavor to agree on
a match at 134 pounds, to take place late
in August They will probably reach an
agreement, as both are anxious for an
other bout.
With no match in prospect, the bouts
in the Olympic Club arena next Friday
night take an added importance. The
principals will be: C. S. Vickers and
George Baker. 12!s pounds; George Simp
son and Charles ThuTÃton, catch weights,
and P. Ast and R. A. Woods, 148 pounds.
As all these have established reputations
as boxers, the bouts should prove inter
esting.
WITH ThjE CRICKETERS
In the last communication received from
the secretary of the Los Angeles Cricket
Club the southerner* reiterate the expres
sion of their wish to visit this city and
play a two days' match against the picked
players of Sau Francisco. They can get
together a fairly strong team from the
following: G. Betts, W. S. Belfield. M. G.
Burmester, H. Jones Bateman, R. H. Hay,
â¢Mr. Chapman. E. Cawston, H. Little, J
E. Martin, C. K. Maud. P. Pedley, J.
Scott, H. Wilfrid Walker, E. B. Ward and
W. H. Young. The southerners are clearly
of the opinion that the cricketers of this
city ought to defray half the cost of
transportation for the visitors, saying
that it has been the custom in Los An
geles to pay the full expenses of visiting
i teams, as was done in the case of a Bak
ersfleld eleven visiting the southern capi
tal, though there was at that time no
organized club there. They say that they
wuuld be willing to pay half the expenses
of any San Francisco team that later
may visit Los Angeles and suggest that
the match might be played on an inclosed
ground and gate money charged.
While the San Francisco cricketers
would be glad to provide board and lodg
ing for the visitors during their stay
I here, it is doubtful whether they will see
i their way clear tn pay half their* traveling
; expenses. It is certain that the associa
tion, which still has painful recollections
of the visit of the Australian team to this
city, cannot sustain any such outlay.
A team of cricketers will leave Portland
on August 5 and will visit Victoria Van
couver Nanaimo and New Westminster
playing against the local elevens They
; will return to Portland on Sunday Au
! gust 13. E. D. Severs, a former member
I of the Pacific Club, who now lives in Port

OARSMEN
TO GOVERN
THEMSELVES
FORM A NEW ASSOCIATION
Astoria Regatta the Rendez
vous oP the Coast
Scullers.
The absorbing topic among oarsmen is
the forthcoming rowing regatta to be heid
at Astoria. It is the sixth annual aquatic
carnival held there and will take place
on August 21 and 22. Much progress has
been made toward the formation of a new
organization to be named the Puciric
Coast Association of Amateur Oarsmen,
to include all the rowing clubs from Brit
ish Columbia to San Diego. A coj
the proposed constitution and by-;..-
--the new association has been sent to this
city, and has already been signed by J.
R. Bockman on behalf of the Ariel~. by
\Y. ( . Espy on behalf of the Pioneers, by
A. P. Roihkopf as the representative of
the Dalphins and by S. J. Pembroke for
the Alamedas. It has been handi
Georgo James as representative of the
Olympic Boat Club, and will be s-ant to
J. J3. Budd us president of the Stockton
Athletic Association tor signatures. The
Astoria Rowing Association has --
the document, and copies have been sent
to Portland and also to Victoria and Van
couver, B. <_'. Each rowing dub haa
requested to sena delegates and to name
one of its members to serve on the board
of directors. Inert- was at ftrsl some talk
of opposition from the regatta commit
tee of the Pacific Association of the Ama
teur Athletic Union, which will be shorn
of some of its importance by the new or
ganisation, and which resented th<
chat the promoter? of the new association
did not consult the committee or take it
into us confidence. The opposition, how
ever, r j s faded away and tnÂ«r new
elation may be regarded tin to
come Into existence. Its headquarters
will be at Astoria, and for the Hrst time
there will really be such a thing :ih a
Pacific Coast championship in rowing.
Hitherto th-* so-called "champions of the
Pacific Coast" have been merely cham
pions of the bay of San Francisco and its
tributary streams. The Pacific Asa
tion will now have to confine itself to the
management of track and field events
i which fall properly within its jurisdiction
as a branch of the Amateur Athletic
Union) and of local regattas, over which
It has assumed control by virtue of an
amendment to its constitution.
The coming Astoria regatta bids fair to
be highly successful. The University of
California crew will go, with A] Leah as
trainer, and will probably reach A
early enough to take part in the track
and field games to be held on Augu
in which two or three- Stanford men will
participate. The university crew will
probably row in the Stockton barge. The
Alameda senior barge crew have all ob
tained leave of absence from their em
ployers and will be in excellent condition
for the races. Barge crews of the P-mth
Knds. Pioneers and Ariels will have a
try-out; and the winning four will go to
the regatta. Dr. C. C. Dennis will pull in
shell and outrigged skiff, the use >>f \
fine shell having been offered him by the
Astoria Boat Club. J. Foley will" also
pull In both events.
The pingle-shell race will be rowed in
heats, and if Dr. C. C. Dennis and another
San Francisco man should both win their
heats the use of a second shell can be ob
tained. H. \Vittkopf. who was formerly
shell champion of the bay. is desirous to
go. and C. L. Ochs of the Pioneers may
also make the trip if he can get a boat.
The city of Portland has offered a tine
silver cup as a prize for the single-shell
race, which will be keenly contested, as,
besides the San Francises men. Alexander,
Patton and one or two other northerners
are entered.
The four-oared shell race will also pro
duce a "-ood struggle, for the two Vancou
ver clubs have made up one crew between
them, taking the bent men from each
The executive committee consists of (',. C.
Fulton, president: Harrison Allen, secre
tary, and E. C. Hughes, treasurer. The
committee has announced its intention of
ratifying- all arrangements made on its be
half by its local representative. S. J. Pem
broke, who will be its guest during the
carnival. If the Pacific Association of the
Amateur Athletic Union sees fit to enter
a crew the committee will' be glad to ac
cept the entry.
At the last meeting of the Alameda
Boating Club S. J. Pembroke was chosen
as its representative on the board of di
rectors of the Pacific Coast Association
of amateur oarsmen. The newly elected
officers entertained the members with mu
sic, refreshments and a trip on the estu
ary in launches.
The South End Rowing Club at its last
meeting appointed Dr. C. C. Dennis and
J. Foley Its representatives to the associa
tion about to be formed and gave them
full power to act. If the South Ends ger
their new barge, which is now ready the
"Midgets" may take the northern trip
though it is doubtful whether Frank Du
plissea can go. R. Mac Arthur. Emil Blum
lein. M. J. Breen and George Bates were
out in a barge last Sunday. J. Foley Is
practicing in the skiff, and has improved
in his work. If the South Ends desire to
send R. Mac Arthur to Astoria his case
should be brought up before the registra
tion commissioners, who should definitely
settle the question of his status and either
pronounce him a professional or clear him
entirely. Up to the present time the ques
tion has been shirked. The registration
commissioners have behaved like the man
who pulls the trigger of a gun and then
runs away at the report.
The Pioneer senior barge crew, consist
ing of the Lawaon brothers. O'Neill and
"Wilder, have been out together two or
three times lately.
There are many signs of a revival of In
terest In rowing at Stockton, which pro
poses next year to send a barge crew to
the carnival In northern waters.
A NOTED TERRIER DIES.
Lovers of the dog will hear with regret
that Mrs. H. H. Carlton's famous Boston
terrier, Oakslde Bessie, is dead. Last
Sunday she underwent an operation but
in vain. Two of the most skillful veteri
narians on the coast, Drs. Skaife and
Steers, did all that was possible to .save
her. but their efforts were fruitless. Oak
side Bessie's bench show career has been
one uninterrupted success. She captured
first prize every time she was shown. A
nobler, better tempered or more faithful
dog never breathed. Her intelligent af
fection for her mistress seemed human.

No. 7 threw up his hands. The starter
called and called for the other three crows

fierce, and not one of them dared to give

reinforced by the whistle on board the

into a erand contest between the New

HYDRAULIC WAR
OPENED AGAINN
IN THE VALLEY
The Caminetti Law Is
Assailed.
MINERS TAKE UP THE FIGHT
; SUTTER COUNTY ENJOINS THE
RED DOG MINE.
The California Miners' Association
Assumes the Defense in Behalf
of the Reviving In
dustry.
The hydraulic miners and tho Anti
Debris Association of the Sacrament
Valley have again squared off for a big
legal fight after some years of practical
peace under the restraining influences o
the I Jaminetti law.
Robert T. Devlin, manager and attorney
of the reaWy defunct Anti-Debris Asso
elation, !>ns brought Buits in Suiter Coun
ty t<> !â¢ strain m\m Nevada County hydrau
lie mines fmm operating further, al
these companies have built pri
vt their workings to im .
their tailfngs according to plans <
approved by the Federal engineers com- |
I posing the California Debris Cnmmi.^inr,,
secured the commission's permit to mine
after Inspection of the dams ami have
otherwise obeyed the requirements of the
i Caminetti law.
This law of Congress places the regula
tion of hydraulic mining on the water-
Bheds of the navigable streams of this
! State -wholly In the hands of these Fed
i eral engineers. It is net allege.! that the
Caminetti law has been infracted. The
suits Ignore this ln.w and aÂ«sumt that the
courts may ignore it at their dlscn tion
and stop any hydraulic mining, n gard
bris < "ftmmission's li<
tliat i Blurt â  urt may review the com
mission's acts. This would nullify the
.Cam!;.": law and again practically stop
hydraulic mmli
One Buit has been brought in Sutter
County In the name of that county en
joining the Kate Hayes hydraulic mine of
Neva la County and against the
Red l>ufc mine on <'.:
Y'ju Bet, Nevada County. The streams
: on which these mines are dram into the
â¢ Bear and the Bear Into the Feather. The
i Red Dog company began mining behind
their dam under a permit, according- to
the Caminetti law. in January of last
year. .Their approved log dam is now
i thirty feet high, it having been raised as
; the reservoir filled with tailings. The de
j bris that has gone into the B^nr ha -
| that suspended in the water pouring over
the dam.
The suit simply alleges that the de
fendants have damaged two bridges
across the Bear River near W'heatland
one across the Feather at Marysvi:
j also a hospital, all through filling up the
river. The suit is Bimply to Test the con
stitutionality of the Caminetti law. On
th ir.st. :hp Superior Court of B
County temporarily enjoined the Red Dog
mine In the face of the Caminetti law.
The danger to this law, for which the
miners worked bo hard so Long, has led
the California Miners' Association to
strongly take up the cause of the defend
ants. From the beginning the policy Of
the association has been conciliation, but
now it is fight. The executive committee
held a sj.ecial meeting on the matter at
the Union League ciub Tuesday Presi
dent .T. 11. Nefr in the chair. Many San
Francisco members were present and
among others were John MoMurray of
Trinity County, Harold T. Power of ' Pl
acer, A. H. Ten Broeck of El Dorado, Ma
lor McÃride of Nevada, A. Ekman of
liutte and C. C. Derby of Santa Clara,
James Spaulding. president of the Red
Dog Company, and W. F. Engleb'right,
viry, were present.
During a long and spirited discussion
it was decided to take up the fight in
behalf of all the hydraulic miners and to
mon< v 'M carry on the Mght to the.
A special committee was appointed
lire counsel. Thus a long legal war
seems launched. The battle, however,
â¢ revive the fierceness and hitter
f the old fight, which ended with the
Sawyer decision and the paralysis of hy
draulic mining nearly twenty years ago.
Yesterday's Insolvents.
G. Loeb, C. W. Quilty and L. M. Pinard
of Santa Clara County petitioned the
T'nited States District Court yesterday to
declare insolvent the Azule Seltzer Water
Company of San Jose.
T. Hutton of Oakland filed a petition,
stating his llbilities at $1828 05 and his as
sets at $625.
H. W. Cowell, formerly president of the
foreclosed Stanislaus and San Joaquin
Water Company, filed a petition, stating
his liabilities at $193,815 15 and his assets
at $26,500, most of which assets value is in
land. Arthur Levinsky. Mr. Cowell's at- !
torney, explains that Mr. Cowell's liabil- I
ities are as a stockholder in the bankrupt |
company for the debts of the company, !
under the statute, and not for any of his â 
individual nd personal Indebtedness.
Swiss Shooting Festival.
The Swiss colony of San Francisco,
through Attllio Mona, yesterday tele
graphed to Augustino Solarl, president of
the committee in charge of the target

Switzerland, the sum of 200 francs to be
used as a cash prize to be awarded to
shoofrs. This Is the largest contribu-
L tion frorr any Swiss colony In the United
States. New York sent on 125 francs.
Still More counterfeiting.
The Secret Service has juet unearthed an
i other band of counterfeiters and secured a
large quantity of b"gns bills, which are bo

would never euspect them of being spurious
I Things of great value are always selected for
imitation, notably Hngtetter's Stomach Bitters,

disorders like Indigestion, dyspepsia, constipa

OPERA THAT
IS WORTHY OF
RECOGNITION
j THE production at the Grand Opera-
I house this week wins a favorable
I criticism through its general excel
lence. Faust, Marguerite, Siebel,
Valentine anc he chorus demand recog
nition and receive it repeatedly for both
solo and ensemble work. Marguerite and
Siebel are especially worthy performers,
for both Miss Mason and Miss Ladd have
dramatic ability not too often found in
the operatic world. Many a time at high
priced attractions we have heard .their
parts sung nut half so well and seen
them actedâ not at all. Spinning song,
| jewel song, flower song â all the gems of
the opera come to us with their full
meaning and send us away in a mood
for humming and a humor for remem
bering. Miss Ladd does Siebel from her
inmost consciousness and tills in orches
tral pauses with such natural and appro
! priate action that special mention is quite
in place. This holding the stage while
the orchestra sings on is generally done
with a stride or two, a gesture heaven
ward and chestward, a gulp and a gasp :
and a final inflation of the lungs against j
the approaching solo. Miss Ladd, to this !
traditional business, may ever plead not
guilty and ever be acquitted. The chorus |
at this theater is timed and tuned- and
; modulated by an Intelligent baton and so
! generous in numbers that stylelace shout
-1 ing is never called upon to do duty in
answer to the command fortissimo. The
! public should look to it that they make j
: themselves worthy of this generosity by | ,
i being decently grateful and not compla- i j
ceotly taking for granted what their i ;
past experience has seldom held. The , |
mistake of the production lies in casting i
William Wolff as Mephisto. It is not only
a mistake, but it is not fair to Mr. Wolff, ]
who, when given the right parts, never
fails to impress an audience with his |
! ability. As Mephisto, he is impossible â 
I and comes ever upon the scene an in
trusion from farce comedy. The rene- j
gade, the fallen angel, the subtle, sneak-
Ing Insidious fiend, chuckling over his
successful villainies, find no favor in his '
performance. Such a devil as he, in such ;
rude health, with such a comedian's voice. ;
would kill" the cause he would support '
and magnetic, compelling temptation to
sin would soon become as extinct as the
dodo. Faust, if passionate, was intelli- ;
gent and cultured, and no clown could |
ever lure him to hades. Let us give the
gifts that we have to th opportunities
that lie in our way and if, as part of a
stock conrpany, we crave the things that
should not be, the manager, reading i
aright our erring souls, should give to ;
us what we would ask could we see.
Whatever masterpieces may yet lie hid
den in the soul of William Wolff, and we (
believe there are many, they will never i
reach the light in Mephistophelian form.
The last act is fine. Gounod's music here ,
would stir the soul of a clod, He well ;
understood how to reach the emotions
through tragic melody. Like Mephisto
himself, "though not omniscient, much
to him was known." The electric effects
are good and the scenery clean and fresh â 
and pleasant to the eye from this point I
of view, but the atmosphere of vine-clad
Virginia homes with Gothic cathedral dis
tance effects does not suggest the abiding j
place of Marguerite. A few properties,
wholly unnecessary and quite Incorrect,
coaxed out for purposes of decoration,
should be wheeled back to the niches ;
from which they were lured. Must the
easy, wide and gentle road that leads
to a correct understanding of period for- ,
i ever remain a terra incog, to the man
who holds our scenic fate In his well- j
intentioned grasp? Next week merry

DRIED FRUIT IN NEW YORK.
The New York Commercial says: "Some dis
cussion has been aroused by reported future
Fales of prunes. Aside from that the market
is quiet and sales are limited. AH supplies are
held firm, however, on the theory that stocks
en hand will pass into consumption before the
new crop of any variety comes in.
"Interest has been created in prunes by the
reported Bales of a number of cars for future
delivery at around Wic. The number of cars
1- variously estimated, but practically all agree
that for what Is probably the opening sale it
Is a large one. It is said that some are *or
export while others are for distribution from
this market. Spot trading is not large, but de
mand is reasonably steady, and prices are
practically unchanged. ...Â»,_
* "Apricots attract me attention, and there
may be heavy sales later, though bo far as
known up to date, the quantity purchased for
this market has been small. Sales will be
larger later inure particularly If the reported
output is less than 500 :ars, the latest estimate
given At the prices asked it is said that sales
will be very small In this market. A slight
reduction in price would lead to large sales
â¢Peaches afe in rather more demand, but all
spot supplies are so firmly held that business
Is small. There is seme movement, but it is
necessarily limited. Reduction in price would
clean up practically everything in hand within
a few days."

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. July 28.â T0-day's stock mar- j
ket was strong early and traders generally I
ranged. themselves on the long side. The shorts
took alarm from yesterday's rise and the con- â¢
tlnued upward tendency this morning and coy- j
ered rather extensive lines. London marked
Up prices before the opening here and bought ;
considerable amounts In this market. The j
sentimental effect of this buying was even more j
pronounced than the direct demand for stocks, j
The recovery In French rentes in Paris had a \
Etlmulatlng effect and part of London's buying ;
of Americans was reported to be for the recent j
account. Taken all in all there was sufficient
demand for stocks to run the business up to :
â¢within 20,000 shares of yesterday's total tran-
Factions and considerably over the total for
eume days of this week: Business fell off.
however,' very notably in the afternoon. The
public showed itself still coy about coming for
ward and bull operators in consequence pro
ceeded to take their profits on the advance.
The stocks which had advanced yesterday and
the day before were especially affected and In
a number of cases were carried below last
night's level. Pt. Louis Southwestern stocks.
Kansas and Texas preferred. Lake Erie West
ern and the trunk lines were examples. There
was nevertheless an appreciable increase in
commission house business. This was con
spicuous in the grangers. Burlington leading
on account of the benefit to the crops from
rain. The coalers were notably strong on the
approaching operation of a higher scale of
prices, and Lackawnnna, which in addition
enjoyed the b.nefit of a reported combination
with Now York, (Thicago and St. Louis, rose
an extreme 4 points. Louisville was the leader
of the market, considered as to strength and
activity, It closed at the top price at a net
pain of "if. over yesterday. Since the dividend
<tf 2 per cent was taken off yesterday morning
the stock has risen' 4 * points. There was an
active demand for sugar all day and the price
vent to lCl^g. National Steel was strong on
the reported acquirements of new property
and Brooklyn Rapid Transit rose an extreme
l 3 i. 'here was a belated upward movement In
come of the Southwestern stocks not heretofore
nffected. Denver and Rio Grande preferred,
Southern Pacific, Pt. Louis* and San Francisco
second preferred and the St. Joseph and Grand
Island stocks gained from 1 to 5 points. The
late realizing movement carried prices down
from the best and the market closed dull and
easy. To-morrow's bank â â â¢â¢â â .: is expected
to show another loss in cash, owing to opera
tions with the sub-treasury. Sterling exchange
â¢was weak and lower on account of London buy

! BRADSTREET'S FINANCIAL REVIEW.
â  NEW YORK. July 28.â Bradstrect's Financial |
; Review will say to-morrow: Speculation is i
still without Important movements and the :
activity of trading on the Stock Exchange has j
] been at a low ebb. all week. The professional i
traders supply nearly all the actual Interest. |
1 The public is taking little part and the pools
â  and large operators rest while these condi- â 
tions exist. London has not been a factor and
the market there and abroad is experiencing ;
I the usual midsummer dullness. As far as the j
' railroad share list is concerned the favorable ,
i crop prospects and the large increases in cur
rent earnings reported by some Important lines,
â  to say nothing of confident predictions that j
I tonnage will continue heavy during the re- .
mainder of the year, keep up a steady to
strong tone and facilitate short-lived rallies |
: from time to time. This process has been i
I particularly noticeable In connection with the !
j grangers and Southwestern stocks. A few of
. ' the specialties have been the objects of ma
-1 ' nipulatton and even the Industrials shared to
â  some extent in the bullish influences. The last
, : named portion of the market is, however, on
â¢ the whole, neglected. Foreign exchange has I
! been steady and dull at below the gold point 1
1 and fears of a renewed movement of specie
: to Europe are laid aside. Indeed, as noted
1 elsewhere, the London market and the for
eign financial press are inclined to dwell
1 upon the probability of having to supply a de
-1 mand for gold from this aide in the autumn and
1 winter, when our cotton and grain exports as
sume their expected activity. The unwonted
firmness of the money : market here has cer
, tain!yÂ«been a factor of increasing Importance
[ this week. The market was too dull to say 1
; that this has developed any positive bullish
ness. The fact that the New York bank re
eerves are low. that money does not come back
readily from the Interior and that the supply of
â¢ funds for both call and time loans has been
â  reduced to such an extent that interest rates
1 are decidedly firmer and it costs appreciably
more to carry Stocks are, however, calculated
I Ito affact speculative sentiment. It is apprc
(â  elated that the activity of general business is
1 creating an enlarged demand for money in the
illation and there is an Idea that when
, this Is supplemented by the need arising in
? connection with the crop movement there may
> be a scarcity of funds for speculative pur
, poses. The disposition in some quarters is. in
* fact, to preach conservatism and to regard the
a possible absorption of capital in actual busi
* ness as liable to check further Improvement In
either speculative or investment values. Time
s money has been in Increased demand on the
i street this week, or rather the supply has been
i smaller, and 4Â®4% per cent are the rates gen
? erally quoted, while call money has. held unex
a pectedly firm at 3%^4 per cent.
These rates have not. Indeed, been sufficiently
high to Induce liquidation, but in the absence
â â of any marked augmentation of the New York
bank reserves, they are cited as indications
A that an autumnal "boom," based on good
Â£ crops and railroad earnings, is not a certainty.
1 The subsidence of the street railway strikes In
New York has left the market Indifferent to
2 manifestations elsewhere of the same charac
-4 ter. Reports of coming deals and combinations
4 in the railroad world are for the moment
â  x without decided effect and the speculative com-
/ X munity as a whole appears to be waiting for
l the outcome of the situation, though one Fri
day the professionals evinced more of a dlspo
l sltion to discount the situation, their buying
i. and support resulting In a general rise through
<, out the active stock list.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY. JULY 29, 1899.
however, exercising any particular influence on
prices which display nearly all their old firm
ness, and in fact, show still further advances
in several lines. â¢ Official statistics of -piglron
production for the first half of 1899 point to the
largest production on record having been in
sufficient to offset current demand, and stocks
at the close of the half year are far below
what they were at the opening or at this time
one year ago. Special activity in the iron and
steel industry is reported at Chicago, where
heavy advances have been made in finished
products and numerous shipments are report- .
ed not only to Ohio and Pennsylvania, but as
far east as" Boston. Every blast furnace in the
Birmingham district is expected to be In opera
tion by the autumn, but production for the lat
ter part of the year. 1899. which promises to
be enormous, has all been booked. Ihe glass
trade is reported particularly active and con
ditions in that Industry are said to be the best
O Th > c ca cere af markets note little change in
price, but trade opinion seems to favor steady
demand and few fluctuations in view of admit
tedly large necessary takings by foreigners
Among the metals tin has displayed special
strength, largely In sympathy with heavy ad
vances abroad, claimed to have a legitimate
basis In heavily Increased consumption without
corresponding "output of the raw material. ,
Smaller arrivals and heavily reduced stocks of ,
raw sugar, added to large sales of refined,
have resulted In advance in the former product.
Lumber is strong in price and some bulldin*
operations are Interfered with. Northwestern
shipments of white pine are reported very
heavy for this season. Fall demand for dry
goods Is increasing, but complaints of slow
1 delivery are more frequent. Manufacturers of
woolen poods are purchasing more freely of
fine domestic grades and prices tend upward,
although there Is less speculative buying re
ported at leading markets. .

DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK. July 28.â O. Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade will say to-morrow:
There is certainly room for some decrease 1
when the volume of payments through the
clearing house in July is 47.2 per cent larger
than last year and 59.6 per cent larger than in !
1892, the 1 best of all previous years. So great ;
ati advance would warrant expectation of some
setback under ordinary circumstances. This !
year the unusual freedom from labor troubles â¢
I about July 1 is followed by some signs of a j
1 tendency to strike because great works are
committed far ahead and cannot halt without
loss. But interruption of business by labor
troubles of. all sorts has been less than in any ,
ether July for years.
Nor is the movement of products hampered.
Western receipts of Wheat In July have been ;
15.563.526 bushels, against 7.309.333 bushels last '
year to date, and of Corn 20,485,251 bushels, ,
against 9,173,355 bushels last year, even the '
latest week showing large gains over last year.
Exports of Wheat from both coasts were 9,939,
--2 SO bushels. Flour Included, against 8,833, iy2
bushels last year.
Corn exports also continue surprising.
Copper Is strong at 18M.C for lake, with spot
scarce, and Lead weak at $4 55, but Tin Is
quoted at $31 56, London leading as usual. :
Manufacturers have been buying much Wool,
It is said, but less the past week, although ,
many are taking sample bales. Goods are In
fair demand, but no further change in prices I
Is mentioned. Sales in four weeks have been j
46.779,600 pounds, of which 35,954,500 pounds j
were domestic. In 1897, with a new tariff com- ;
ing, speculation took 46,109,200 pounds, normal
consumption being about half that quantity.
Cotton goods are stronger for bleached, and the
general tone is good In spite of cheap Cotton, j
Shipments of boots and shoes from the East j
In four weeks have been 394,379 cases, against ,
360.539 capes last year, and in 1895, the nearest
previous year, 351.359 cases. Leather continues j
strong and scarce, with a combination of
packers lifting prices of hides at Chicago, ho
that many of the tanners are quitting that
market.
Railroad business for July showed the largest
Increase of any month this year, 16.1 per cent :
larger than last year and 10.4 per cent larger
than In 1892.
Failures for the week have been 151 in the
United States, against 225 last year, and 20 in ; ,
Canada, against 26 last year.

CHIOAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO,. July - 28.â C00l weather, weak
cables and Argentine shipments of. consider
ably over 1,000,000 bushels caused a weak Wheat
market at the opening. September started \*<si
â¢4c off at T0%@70%c, and on selling by longs
fell Immediately to 70% c. The market rallied
Irregularly to 70- .c before noon. Trade was
very light, outside orders being almost en
tirely nil. Reports of fine weather in France
and England caused some selling. Press dis
patches from Bombay reporting the Indian
Wheat crop withering because of the failure of
the â¢ monsoon started shorts to cover. Some
crop damage news from the Pacific Coast
and the Northwest, together with Snow's crop
report showing a decline of from 5 to 15 points
in portions of the Northwest, stimulated heavy
buying by local professionals near the close.
September rose to 71% c and closed with sellers
at that figure, a net gain of %c.
Corn ruled fairly active and higher with
Wheat. The market appeared to have been
oversold during the recent decline. Crop re
ports were generally favorable. September
closed a shade higher than yesterday.
Oats ruled dull but firm. September closed
a shade higher for the day.
i Provisions recovered 'from a spell of weakness
at the opening and closed 15c higher for Sep
tember pork. 10c better for lard and 10c higher
for ribs.

for a fortnight overloads the market. The "lut

to the shortness of the crop and the heavy
exports to the East.

HIDES, TALLOW. WOOL AND HOPS.
The circular of Jacob Wollner says of Wool:
"Our market, in spite of the condition of the
Eastern seaboard markets and Oregon and
Montana. Is not brisk," owing to the fact that
shippers do not like to take hold of wools at
the present asking prices, and scourers ' are
still working on old contracts. It will take
them a week or two yet to clean up.
, "There is still a great deal of wool in this
market unsold, comprising the best kinds,
such as Humboldt. Oregon and Nevada wool.
A good many lambs' wools have come in and
found a ready sale from s@7c.
"The Eastern markets are ' reported very
active, almost amounting to a boom. When the
shippers get up a little more courage and East
ern commission brokers get higher offers for
scoured wool there will be some more busi

Harrison's circular says: "During the week
there have been five deliveries of coal from
Washington of 10,131 tons; four from British
Columbia, 13,746 tons; one from Oregon,^ 460
tons; one from Australia, 2347 tons; total. 2b,
--654 tons. Business in this line Is fair, princi
pally for steam uses, as the demand for do
mestic fuel at this season is always light. The
transports of the Government are calling freely
for coal, which in the aggregate foots- up a
large amount. If the department purchases
their varied supplies relatively as cheap as
they do fuel, the quartermaster locally will
make a good showing. The local supply of coal
in yard is light, as the lack of carriers is be
ing seriously felt; freight rates are high, but
tonnage is unprocurable. We have 'been fill-
Ing such large orders for lumber for several
months past that coal carriers have been di
verted to this branch, and in most cases they
are chartered for long voyages, thus creating
a gap which cannot be filled for the moment.
"Freights on coal from Australia to San
Francisco have been marked up. as Honolulu
Is paying 2s fid per ton more than our import
ers can afford to pay. hence we can expect hut
small shipments from that source for several
months to come." _â \ ,

The Klmhurst Improvement Club in the
- given above concludes a stinging
protest against an editor being made a
School Trustee of the thriving little town

No sooner had the news of the appoint
ment reached Klmhurst than the improve
ment club had a special meeting, unani
mously adopting resolutions ii which was
embodied a vigorous protest against the
action of the County Superintendent in
what the members termed the arbitrary
appointment of Storer.
The preamble to the resolutions recite
that Mr. Storer is "a temporary resident
of Elmhurst and not in any sense a tax
payer or property owner, and, further, a
practically unanimously defeated candi
date for School Trustee at the recent elec
tion held in Elmhurst last month. 1 A
statement that Storer had presented a
petition of "all residents of Elmhurst"
may be true, continue.- the preamble, "but
the petition on its face must be bogus
It is then asked that the matt of the
appointment of Trustee Show's successor
be delayed for at least a week, conclud
ing with the resolution embraced above.
This protest was promptly forward* to
County Superintendent Crawford, who to
day answered the remonstrance briefly
by acknowledging its recoipt and inform
ing- the club that the appointment had
already been made, the vacancy being
rilled by a man who will probably do his j
duty.
"Now. there's nothing more to do about j
this affair," said Mr. Crawford to-day.
"The appointment rested with me. and 1
made it, and ! f^el that the selection was
a good one. Mr. Storer comes well recom
mended. Among thf signers of his peti- '
tion were some of the best men of Elm
hurst. Including School Trustees Flan kin
and Jones. ex-Trustee Ed Hoerst, Post- j
master Gray and It. Lynch. Mr. Storer
has one child in school now and two
others nearly old enough to attend."

MONEY FOR SAN DIEGO.
The County Wins In Its Action
Against Riverside.
The Supreme Court has passed upon the
rase of the county of San Diego againsi
the county of Riverside and de< Ided
against the intter. The action i* similar
to that of Colusa and Glenn counties, re
cently decided. Riverside was created as
a county by the Legislature of 1893 out of
the territory of San Bernardino and San
Diego counties, and the mutual claims
and obligations were Boon alter adjusted
by a commission. Prior to the creation
of the new county there was owing from
the Southern Pacific Company to Ban
Diego County a considerable sum or
money for taxes delinquent for tht; years
1880 and 1887.
In 1894 the Board of Equalization made
reassessments of the railroad's property
for 1880 and 1887, and that part of the
line, tracks, etc., in Riverside County
was awarded thereto. These reassess
ments were entered upon the tax roll* of
the counties interested according to the
erroneous apportionment of the Board of
Equalisation, and the State Treasurer, by
whom the taxes were collected from the
railroad company, paid the same to the
treasuries of the counties. Riverside re
ceiving $7969 65 more and San Diego that
amount less than they would have re
ceived if the whole amount of delinquent
taxes had been awarded according to the
ratio established by the commissioners.
San Diego County was obliged to sue
her sister county in Los Angeles for the
sum mentioned, and won the case. This
decision was affirmed by the higher court
upon the general ground that the taxes
were properly payable to San Diego
County in the first instance, and the por
tion received by Riverside "was so re
ceived only in consequence of a mistake
made by the Board of Equalization and
by the State Treasurer.

BURGLAR SHOT BY A
WELLS-FARGO AGENT
THIEF STOLE W. W. FULMER'S
CLOTHES AND MONEY.
A Lively Fusillade Upon Roadside
Bushes. From Which Groans
Were Heard by a
Neighbor.
The residents of the little town of San
Mateo had a real live burglar in their
midst in the middle of this week, which
caused no end of excitement, for the dis
covery of the criminal was attended by
some lively shooting and a strong belief
that the thief was struck by one of the
bullets. The gentleman whose house the
thief entered is Walter W. Fulmer, the
purchasing agent for Wells, Fargo & ('->.
of this city. After finishing his work on
Thursday Mr. Fulmer went home and in
due time to bed. During the night Mrs
Fulmer was aroused by seeing the outline
of a strange man standing at the foot of
the bed. The first supposition was that
her mother had entered the room, but this
was dispelled hy seeing the fellow seize
her husband's pantaloons and vest and
dart out of the room.
The frightened lady aroused her hus
band, who seized his revolver and rushed
to the front door. Not seeing the burglar,
he fired a shot at random and then began
systematically to shoot into every bush
and clump of vines that grow along the
fence, for a distance of 199 yards. The
reports of the weapon attracted the atten
tion nf a lady living in the next house,
near the end of the block. She raised the
window ami after the last shut was Bred
listened for what would happen next.
While waiting she distinctly heard groans
as of some one in pain about a quarter of
the distance from her house to that of Mr.
Fulmer. After a little theÃe sounds re
ceded and all waa silent.
Mr. Fulmer i.fter emptying his revolver
made an investigation of the premises and
found that the thief had broken into the
house by opening a pantry window. He
removed a large jar of preserves from the
shelf and climbed down over several
shelves of glassware, showing that he was
no novice. After drinking several glasses
of milk arid eating freely of the . good
things in the pantry he visited the room
of the servant girl, which he ransacked
without disturbing her. The next move
was upon the room occupied by the owner
nf the bouse. Mr. Fulrnrr's trousers con
tained $75 in cash, and in the vest was a
valuable gold watch. In the morning the
garment? were found In the road, but the
valuables were missing. The thief in ran
sacking the house did not take any of the
silverware, showing that he desired only
such plunder as could be easily disposed
of. The town marshal made an investiga
tion, and that seems about as far as he
could go; but all of the residents of thd
<iuiet iittle town are now the possessors of
pistols.

During the evening there was the throw-!

PRETTY MATTIE
TYRER ELOPED
AND IS LOCATED
Two Disappearances
Are Cleared Up.
TESLA COAL MINE ROMANCE
SKIPPED WITH A MAN WHO
DESERTED A WIFE.
In the Thriving Coal Town She and
C. L. M. Wolf, a Timekeeper,
Are Known as Mr. and^
Mrs. Charles Leiter.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 2S.
Pretty Mattle Tyrer, aged 19 years, who
mysteriously disappeared from her home
; on Parsons street, Golden Gate, recently,
has been located at Tesla, the thriving
little coal mining town in the eastern part
of this county, where she is known as
Mrs. Charles Letter, and thereby hangs a
tale of romance, elopement, desertion and
two broken family circles.
A clay <>r so after Miss Tyrer'S unex
pected departure her parents. Mr. and
Mrs E C. Atwood, received a hurried note
wherein their daughter briefly Informed
thejn that she had secured a good posi
tion hut was unable to state as yet just
where she would be located.
A few days previously C. L. M. Wolf.
timekeeper for the Judson Manufacturing
Company had suddenly disappeared, de
serting his wife and family, and rumors
were afloat that Mrs. Wolf intended su
ing for a divorce on the ground of cruelty.
It w;ts. moreover, known that Wolf had
been keepiag company with the fair Mat
tie and when she, too, disappeared
friends surmised that the couple had gone
to J.ns Angeles, but nothing cuuld be
learned of them th-ere.
In the meantime the young woman 8
parents had engaged the assistance of
Deputy Sheriff Striker to help locate their
daughter, and he, through A. W. Moore,
superintendent of the coal mines at Tesla,
learned to-day that the missing couple
were living there under the name of Mr.
and Mrs. Charles Leiter, the former hav
ing secured employment at the mines.
The young woman when her Identity
was realized, was asked to return to her
home bur she refused. She wrote a let
ter, however, asking her parents' forgive
ness but declared that she was perfectly
contented with her fate and that Wolf
had promised to legally marry her as soon
a< the Divorce Court could sever his re
lationship to his deserted wife, who is
now living in San Francisco.
Though heartbroken over the manner in
Which his daughter has linked her fate
With Wolf, Mr. AtWOOd expresses a
father's tenderest love for his daughter.
He declares that Mat tie was led away by
the smooth tongue and glittering promises
made by the erstwhile timekeeper, and
s'sb.- has 1" en made Wolf's dupe.
â¢'When this man has tired of the poor
girl " said the father to-day, "she will
rind' her poor old father's arms open to
her and she will be given the shelter and
protection of her home. Had I the power
I would bring this man to justice. Her I
pity with all my heart, for Ikm she is
not to blame for what she has done. She
must not be blamed too much, for her life
lias been an unhappy one for years owing
to illness, and she was no doubt influenced
by bright promises for the future."
Mrs. Atwood is almost broken down un
der the affliction.

GAS INSPECTORS REPORT.
He Explains How Money Might Be ;
Saved.
The report of Gas and Water Inspector
Tupper for the fiscal year just ended
shows that the city has paid for gas and ]
water as follows:
Pan Francisco Gas Company â Gas lamps, :
1173,214 73; gat for public buildings, $9592 32; for â¢
department buildings, $1447 23: electric light for

duction for overcharge $*il<i 91, $244,731 93. â¢
Visitaclon Water Companyâ water lor
hydrants, $24Â«.
The report ends with a .suggestion that
if the water supply were shut off from
school buildings during vacation $12:;T 80
per month could be saved and a saving of
JBSS 74 if it were slim off from public
parks and squares during the rainy sea
son. It further suggests that by abolish
ing street lights- placed too near electric
lights $l'4Hti 60 per annum, could be saved.

TWO OFFICERS
HEAVILY FINED
FOR FIGHTING
MeCloud and Garrity
Found Guilty.
ONE CHALLENGED THE OTHER
POLICE COMMISSIONERS ACT
UNANIMOUSLY.
Both Men Are Suspended and Each
Will Contribute $100 and More
to Replenish the City
Treasury.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 23.
The investigation into the conduct of
Police Officers William McCloud and Pe
ter Garrlty was concluded before the
Board of Fire and Police Commissioners
this afternoon, and as an outgrowth of
the disgraceful fight between the two
guardians of the peace at Seventh and
Market streets on the 19th inst. both were
heavily fined and their suspension con
tinued from the present time until Au
gust L
On the occasion of the set-to it mi
claimed that McCloud had used objection
able words toward his brother officer,
Garrity, who resented them. A fierce
hand-to-hand battle followed, and finally
McCloud drew his revolver.
Neither of the men was very much the
worse for the encounter, but Chief Hods
kins promptly suspended them, leaving
their ultimate fate to the Police Commis
sioners.
At the secret session of the board to-day
Garrity, it is understood, pleaded guilty
to the charges of using vulgar language
and of conduct unbecoming an officer, but
Mit 'loud vigorously denied having used
vulgar language. He maintained that tlvj
only way in which he might have avoided
the trouble was by taking to his heels.
He moreover stoutly denied having drawn
his revolver, asserting that the weapon
fell from his pocket in the scuffle. Ha
stated that Garrity was In full uniform
at the time and challenged him to fight,
while he (McCloud) was on a vacation at
the time and was dressed in citizen's
clothes.
The Commissioners after hearing both
stories fined McCloud $100 and Garrity
$175, regarding the latter the aggressor.
The vote in the board was unanimous.

DRUGGED AND
ROBBED OF HIS
HARD EARNINGS
Desperate Crime of
Two Bunko Men.
JAMES WALKER THE VICTIM
TAKEN IN A HACK TO THE MIS
SION.
Failing to Induce Him to Lose His
Money at Cards, They Placed
"Knockout" Drops in
His Liquor.
James Walker, a recent arrival from
Woodland, Yolo County, is a victim of
misguided confidence. Last Thursday
afternoon he met two well-dressed men
nn Market street, and at thoir sugges
tion they proceeded to a saloon, where
they had several drunks. A game of
cards was proposed, and after several
'hands bad been dealt, Walker became
nuspiciouÃ and started to leave his com
panions One uf the men followed him
and after explaining to him that he was
laboring under a grave mistake, asked
him tÂ«> huve a drink. After partaking "f
the liquor. Walker became dizzy and re
quested the stranger to escort him to his
room in try Winchester House.
Some ume afterward Walker found
him.-elf in a hack, the driver of which
was importuning him t" pay him for his
services. Although stilt daxed from the
effects of the poisoned liquor, U'alker
managed to collect his scattered
and ordered the. Jehu to take him to
police headquarters. After arriving therÂ»
Walker discovered that he had been
rnhbed of hln purse, containing &2S. As
he was still Buffering from the effects of
the "knockout" drops, Lieutenant Martin
had him conveyed to the Receiving Hos
pital, where he was relieved of the drug.
Last night Walker, still suffering from
the effects of his experience, visited the
Central station and gave a good descrip
tion of the men who had robbed him.
He does not think that the hack driver
was a party to the robbery.
"After 1 left the saloon where they gavo
me the knockout drops," remarked Wal
ker, when telling his story, 'I became
dizzy and clung to the arm of my com
panion for support. That is all I remem
ber until I found myself in a hack some
where in the Mission. My purse was gone
and the driver was clamoring for his rare.
Realizing that I was the victim of a des
perate crime, I ordered the driver to take
me to police headquarters." #
To-day an effort will be made to find
the hack driver, as the police believe he
knows the men who "doped" and robbed
the man from Yolo.

but There Was No
Quorum.
There was to have been a double action
meeting of the Boards of Health yester
day. The State board and the local board
were to have met independently and then
In joint session, but neither happened.
Dr. Keeney was summering at Del
Monte and Dr. Coffey was too busy to
get around, consequently there wub no
quorum. It was a matter of employes the
local beard had to consider. Auditor
Wells' action in holding up salary- war
rants of all employes save those provided
for by statute has created a necessity for
some hard figuring. It was the figuring
that was to have been inaugurated. If
there is to be no money with which to
pay employes, heads will have to drop,
or at least the stricken deputies will nec
essarily be shelved until after the court
has decided that the Board of Health may
give out all the jobs the political debts of
its manager require.
The State board was to have discussed
with the local authorities the best means
of getting rid of Dr. Kinyoun and the
other Federal quarantine officials. The
old tight between the State and Federal
offlaers will not down, particularly since
I>r. Cohn was made quarantine officer for
tho State board. The ancient row is on
again right merrily and a corps of ca
pable assistants Is kept at work by the
State board figuring out artistic knocks
to be put on the Federal agent at Wash
ington. However, yesterday the local offi
cials were not on hand to the extent of
a quorum, so the State board called the
business off. It is hardly likely that any
thing more serious than a real indignant
letter will be sent on to the capital.
RIGHT OF FREE SPEECH.
The Street Orators and Sympathizers
Gain a Victory in the Police
Courts.
The street orators and their sympathiz
ers, ten In number, who were arrested on
Thursday night at Fifth and Market
BtreetS for obstructing the street and re
fusing to move on, appeared in the Police
Courts yesterday. A. McGinty, Thomas
Beresford and Pauline Horwitz were In
Judge Conlan'a court, and the Judge, after
hearing the evidence, dismissed the cases.
He said that there was a public meeting
being held, and that the police had no
right to molest the people so long as the
meeting was conducted in an orderly man
ner. The right of free speech was guar
anteed by the constitution uÂ£ the United
States.
Judge Mogan had Joseph O'Brien, "Will
iam Kdlin and G. }i. Benheim before him,
and he also dismissed the cases. He held
that the section of the Penal Code under
which the arrests were made applied to
riots, and the police must show that it
was not a public meeting. This they had
failed to do.
In Judge Treadwell's court J. J. Dunn,
Bessie Kifkin, G. Hatch and Leon Devillc
appeared. On motion of Prosecuting At
torney Carpenter the charge of obstruct
ing the street was dismissed against the
defendants, but the charge of refusing to
move on will be fought out, and the cases
were continued till to-day to give the de
fendants time to plead.
COURT NOTES.
Robert Crinkshank, a teamster, was
charged in Judge Mogun'a court yester
day with fast driving over a street cross-
Ing. He was arrested by Policemen Far
ley and McSorley. After the officers had
given their testimony, Crinkshank wanted
to bet Farley $50 to $10 that the horse
could not run as fast as Farley. The
Judge told Crinkshank that he had better
reserve his bet till to-day, and convicted
him.
As was anticipated, the case of Frank
McFarland, charged with assault to mur
der upon Louis Kirsehbaum at the
Branch County Jail, was dismissed by
Judge Conlan yesterday. Kirschbaum
again took the stand and said his mind
was a blank as tD the assault, and he
did not wish to prosecute the case.
Gladys Daly, the Boubrette who crave
a wine party In ln-r room at the Belmont
House. Turk and Taylor streets, and
spilled some wine on the carpet, got her
personal effects yesterday by order of
judge Slogan. The landlord wanted $50
for iimage t>> the carpet, but the Judge
declui . -liusi him, and all that Gladys
had to pay was $3 50 back rent due.

Spring \ alley Water Works, was yester

arrested early "Wednesday morning on
Kearny street by Policemen Caples and
Howard, appeared before Judge Conlan
yesterday, the woman on a charge of va
grancy and the man for carrying a con
cealed weapon. The woman proved to
be one of the worst characters the Judge
has had to deal with, and was very saucy
In her answers. A murderous looking
knife was found in Bursee's pocket, and
the woman said she bought it for him.
He Bald he carried it. as it might prove
useful. Moth were convicted and ordered
to appear for sentence to-day.
James Fillman, who stole a purse from
Mrs Matilda J. Glover, 25 Hyde street,
was yesterday held to answer before the
Superior Court by Judge Treadwell on a
charge of grand larceny In $2000 bonds.
An old gentleman saw the defendant take
the purse from Mrs. Glover's pocket and
the police would like to hear from him.

Fitch Jr., has sued K. H. McDonald Jr.
and the California Raisin and Fruit
Growers' Association to recover $40,017 on
a judgment rendered in the Superior
Court on August 1, 1894.

ing of the James contest.

order of Knights and Ladles of Honor to
witness the Induction into office of those

According to the Paris police there has

seems they rannot resist the temptations
offered by the displays in the large shops.
ILLEGAL FISHING IN
MARE ISLAND SLOUGHS
CLEANING OUT THE WATERS
WITH UNLAWFUL NETS.
Sportsmen of Vallejo Protesting
Against Persistent Violations of
the L,aw by a Number of
Italian Fishermen.
Some years ago the Napa River and
sloughs whicn cut the marshes whore it
enters the bay were stocked with striped
bass by the Fish Commission, and ever
I since they have afforded sport to the rod
i men and steady occupation for the market
I fishermen. The market fishermen have
been overstepping the limit, however, and
unless stopped they are in a fair way to
clean the waters of that whole section out
of not only striped bass, but everything
else.
The law prohibits the use of "pocket
j nets and all nets with smaller than a four
! inch mesh. This allows all but fish
i weighing three pounds and over to es-
I cape. The pocket net is in extensive use
I around Vallejo, however, and the sports
men of Vallejo and the surrounding coun
try are raising a vigorous protest.
It is claimed then- are no less than eight
or ten boats, each worked by from three
to live men, that are working with nets
prohibited by law and made with ny sh^a
that would hardly let through a ftngerling.
It is known that one of these boats made
a haul of a thousand pounds a short time
I ago. and others have been as illegally
i The flsh are not sold in San Francisco
or in any of the bay towns. To avoid
danger of detection the fishermen ship
I them into the interior of the country to
I the small towns, where they are eagerly
looked for.
The criminal taking of fish is having its
effect upon the stock in the waters around
Vallejo and Mare Island. Where form-
I erly fish used to bite by the score, now
i they do not bite at all. Last year a rod
I and a hook was all that was necessary
| for a fishing trip; this year it requires
: time and a deckload of patience besides,
I and even then the angler must often he
satisfied with a few small fish. This is
â¢believed to be directly due to the wanmn
I destruction of fish of all kinds and sizes
j by the illegal fishermen of the river and
" The matter has been brought to the at
tention of the Sheriffs of Napa and Solano
counties, but so far they have caught no
one. There seems to be no game warden
In <-ithÂ»r county to do any Investigating
1 or arresting, arid the fishermen ply their
I illegal trade without molestation. Those
I suspected are all Italians, and those seen
i from time to time by hunters who haunt
1 the tules have all been Italians. They go
I quietly about their work, but they make
' no secret of it, and they are out in day as
well as night. They have been fishing tne
sloughs since early spring and unless
stopped before the year is up they will
have made a clean sweep of it.

WHOLE VILLAGE
Placed on Wheels and Moved to a
New and Better Site.
The residents of Goldenbridgo. in North
ern Westchester County, moved their vil
lage recently. The entire town, whlcn
Is on wheels, is now one mile farther
east than it was. The town will take an
other jaunt of a mile to-day before it
reaches its destination.
Goldenbrid-ge is. or was. in the north
east corner of Westchester County. Re
cently the New York Aqueduct Commis
i sioner condemned the town and notified
the residents that they would have to
I move.
Several of the old settlers who j*rew up
; with Goldenbridge did not approve of the

dropped one's umbrella in the mud. I
have heard men tell the dreary tale how

conscia recti." over a rival 9 door, offered
to the public "Men's and women'R sibi
conscia recti." I have been myself ac
cused of having no sense of humor be
cause I submitted that that was a dis
mal attempt at humor and "most tragical
mirth " I have met men and women
(but more men) who could sco no humor
in Lewis Carroll or in Edward Lear. I
cannot see the slightest reason for ascrib
ing to women an inferior appreciation of
humor On the other hand, I am in
clined to believe that in the highest kind
of humor in English literature a woman
occupies a very pre-eminent position in

..... . . , Â
ished his investigation of the

which a morning paper absurdly .
attempted to construct a melo-
dramatic master:. The results attain-
cd by Chief Lees are simply corrobora- ;
tive of the facts as published exclusive- (
!y in The Call on July 8. There was. as j
The. Call declared then, no mystery in !
the rase. The box and cherries were j
purchased by Miss Flounce Campbell.
She poisoned some of the fruit, address-

purpose an envelope addressed to her j
by Mrs Rathom and mailed the box to !

opened it and gave some of the cherries ;
to Mrs. Scheib, eating some herself and I
takir.g care that the poisoned cherries!
were out of reach. Neither she nor j
Mrs. Scheib was poisoned, but both i
were made ill by copious draughts of !
mustard. The entire scheme was plan-

she could so frighten Mrs. Rathom that \
she would not use Miss Campbell as j
the co-respondent in the suit for di- â¢
vorce against Rathom. !

disagreeable affair, Chief Lees deter |

discovered certain important facts and j
then confronted Miss Campbell with |
what he had found. She saw that there {
was absolutely no chance of escape and )
confessed the whole plot.- She had been (
caught in her own trap, and while seek- i
ingf to avoid notoriety had been over- i

When seen last evening in his apartments at the hotel the Secretary
proved to be a dignified, courteous : email, a. thorough farmer and a mail
â with a great .store of information pertaining to agriculture. He spoke strong

claims. If persisted in will result In sterility of the soil.
"This continual allowing or the earth so as -Â produce a crop every two
years has been discontinued in all the older farming countries of the world
and should er-asi: in this Slate," Lid Mr. Wilson. "The continual work
ing over of the hoi! will soon greatly exhaust its productive qualities, re
duce its fecundity, and the result will he that in time you will have no -tod

ceased to exist In lowa we would not dream of sowing successive crops of

never fallow your ground at all. It is the greatest mistake possible."
The Secretary also pays there Is a big mistake being made in the manner
in which irrigation is being carried on. He says that too much water is as bad
as too little. When a superabundance is applied to the ground it brings to
the surface an over quantity of alkali, and the result Is a greatly reduced
crop.
"One of the greatest problems you have on your hands '.' continued tho
Secretary. "is the Irrigation of your semi-arid lands. Our department now has
agricultural parks in the Walla Walla and othei valleys of Southern Wash
ington and Eastern Oregon, where we are Ptudving the question of a practical
manner, as well as experimenting with various foreign and domestic grasses
to see which are best suited for forage, purposes to be raised on the barren
ranges thai have been created all through these western and northern coun
tries by neglect and improper irrigation methods."

MILITARY POMP
Fighting First to Be
Highly Honored.
GREAT PREPARATIONS MADE
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE WILL
HAVE FULL CHARGE.
Decides to Make the Home-Coming
of the California Boys a Notable
Event â Grand Military
Demonstration.
The reception which will bo armrdfd j
i the First California Volunteera and the
; California Heavy Artillery nn thrir home
coming promises tfi exceed even the
dreams of the most enthusiastic. Interest
in the arrangements which have already
been made by the Native Sons and
Daughters for the reception of the Fight
ing First was given fresh impetus yes
terday at a conference of the executive
committee, consisting of M. H. de Young. I
A. M. Lawrence and YV. J. Martin, repre- i
â  senting W. S. Leake, with the Native ,
Sons and I >aughters. representatives of j
the military authorities, both national j
j and 1 State; the friends and relatives of!
: the soldier boys and other citizens. The j
meeting was held in the chambers of the
Board of Supervisors, and Mayor Phelan
presided.
In opening the meeting Mayor PhelaJi I
; that its primary purpose was to
j create a spirit of absolute harmony
among the different bodies, committees
and individuals Interested in making the
reception t.> the California hoys an event
in their lives which they shall never for
get.
Patriotic spirit and enthusiasm fairly
! coursed through the veins of everybody
present, and if the plans of those most
deeply concerned in the reception are only
lair realized the celebration over the re
turn of California's gallant regiment will I
: â¢ : â¢ ihaps the most notable event in the
I history ol the Slate.
It was practically decided to have a
grand night parade shortly after the ar
rival (if th.' regiment â¢ that will surpass
jany military demonstration ever held in
ttiis city. Organizations from all the
- hboring towns will be in line.
The lack of knowledge "f the exact time
the Sherman and her cargo of Califor
nia's brave sons will pass through the !
Golden Gate played havoc with all sug
i gestions cone* rning the time of holding
tin big demonstration.
Through General Seaman?, General
: Shatter sent tin- suggestion that it would
be mor< advisable and convenient both
for the military authorities and the troops
to all to proceed direct to tne
Presidio on i ; : â  ; r arrival here, and hold
id.- parade the day after or at any time
in be decided at the discretion of the
I committee.
A large delegation representing the or
ganization of friends and relatives of the
California boys, headed by their chair
man, C. W. Moore.s, was present, and
they stated through him that tiny in
tended to banquet the boys on the morn
ing of their return. If they arrive at j
night or late in the afternoon General I
Shatter will keep them on the transport!
until the next morning. This will give
the committee and the public an oppor- ;
tunity to get matters In shape for their
reception.
Jt was agreed that the relatives of the
boys should have- precedence over all
others, and as soon as the regiment leaves
the transport they will marcti to the* ferry
building, where their relatives will serve
them with a hearty breakfast. Harbor
i Commissioners Paris Kilhurn. Major Har
ney and Rudolph Herold generously stated
! that they would place tne ferry bunding,
I tugs, whistles and, in fact, everything j
that would be of service to the commit
tee at their disposal. Assistant Chief
Wharfinger Dryden. who did much to ,
make the reception of the Oregon troops
a success, displayed marked Interest In
preparations for the reception. Mr.
Dryden has been working like a beaver In I
conjunction with Congressman Julius!
Kahn to a< cord the Nebraskana and the
Utah Battery a hearty reception when
they arrive here either to-day or to-mor
row.
At the suggestion of Nathan Dohrmann,
president ol the Merchants' Association,;
the matter of collecting finances was
taken up. Supervisor Byington, repre
senting the Native Sons, arose and stated
that the Native Sons and Daughters al
ready had a reception fund of $2000, and
they hoped to realize fully $r.n<i more on an
entertainment which will be held in Na
tive Sons' Hall on the evening of August
2. John P. Dockery stated that the medal
committee of the Native Sons and Daugh
ters had alreadj collected jiu'Wij from
downtown merchants.
On motion of Congressman Kahn, the
executive committee was autliorised u>
appoint a special finance committee to
collect fund." to hold a celebration such as
has been outlined above. There is little
danger that this appeal will not be re
sponded to -vali alacrity, as in everj sec
tion of the city a deep Interest is being
manifested in the preparations for the
celebration of the Californa boys return.
The executive committee was also em
powered to appoint all sub-committeea
deemed necessary to makp the celebration
a success and, in fact, assume the entire
responsibility of the celebration.
Samuel Friedlander, the genial manner
of the California Theater, volunteereii to
place the theater and its attraction :.t
the disposal of the commute, any nmlit
that suited its pleasure. A. M. Lawreuce
stated that Mr. Meyerfield. proprietor of
the Orphcum, had informed him that tuo
Orpheum was also willing to give a per
formance for the benefit of the fund.
Moth announcements were roundly ap
plauded.
After the adjournment of the meeting I
the committee members met downstairs j
In the Mayor's ofliee and proceeded at '
once to make arrangements for the recep
tion of all troops due here. They decided
to semi ;l band of music out on the Gov
ernor Jrwin when the tug goes out on her
mission of welcome with Nebraska's Gov
ernor and other State officials, who came
here to welcome their regiment.
At the suggestion of Mrs. Harrington,
president of the Red Cross Society, the
committee decided to purchase a lartre
tent to be erected in t'nion Bauare for
the convenience of returning volunteers
and discharged soldiers. A banking sys
tem will be inaugurated whereby the sol
dier boys can protect their hard earner!
money from their own weaknesses and
the wiles of local sharpers and confidence
men.

The Nebraska volunteers are expected
to arrive on the transport Hancock some
time to-day, and Major General Shafter
has issued orders for all the troops in the
garrison here who can be spared from
their duties to parade in honor of the re
turning veterans. Troop F. Sixth Cav

In hard luck. He Is still behind

breathing all the airs of liberty.
Thomas J. Clisham. alias Davip. the ex

In all of his operations against a gullible public "Brick" McPherson found an

shown tn any of the victims who are now complaining against his chief, but
If Lawyer Harvey Brown ever gets the right line on McPherson it is certain that
McDougail wil go to jail.
the Larkin street saloon keeper, and W.
EC Berry, alias Elmert. the two other
members of the quartet charged by Mrs.
William W. Carroll of having relieved
her ot a sum of money by false pre
tenses, have not as yet been apprehended,
although It is pretty certain that the sa
loon man will surrender himself this
morning. The whereabouts of Elmert is
still unknown to the police.
Intentionally or not, Smoot has lent the
humorous side to the "dope dream" con
spiracy. He dreads life behind the bars.
and, dreading it, is taking even,' means to
make his stay in custody as short as pos
sible. The warrant for his arrest has
been out since the day before yesterday,
â¢but, according to the police, he has not
been seen by any of them. They are un
der the impression that he is out of town,
but believe that he will come In and de
liver himself to-day.
If the police have been unable to see
Smoot since the issuance of the warrant
others have been more observant. Any
number of people have not only seen but
out, but probably 60 per cent will drop off
en mute as their homes arc reached.
The departure, of the transport Indiana
with B<x) recruits for the Philippines has
been postponed until Monday.
Private John F. Gassaway, Troop * ,
Sixth Cavalry, convicted by court-martial
of accidentally killing a comrade, has been
sentenced to four months' Imprisonment

Private John V. Kimball of the army

months' Imprisonment and to forfeit $10
per month of his pay for that period for
being absent without leave.
RETURN OF THE BOYS.
What Is Being Done to Greet the
California Volunteers Upon
Their Arrival Here.
The Invitations to the several hundred
organizations in this cityâ that is. the
subordinate bodies of the various orders
were being tilled out yesterday and were
mailed as .won as possible after they had
been addressed. From the conversations
thai have been had with those in a posi
tion to know it Is believed that almost
every order will be represented in line
and that then- will be a greater number of
people on parade than ever before in this
city.
A great deal of anxiety has been ex
pressed by relatives of men in the return
ing regiment that the proposed banquet
by the committee will interfere with ar
rangements that the relatives have under
wey. The grand marshal assured some
who called at headnuarters yesterday
that their plans would In no way be inter
fered with. It is the purpose of the rela
tives to give the boys a spread at the Pre
sidio immediately after the parade In
this arrangement the committee of the
Native Sons and Daughters will not Lave j
anything to say.
The following named are the committee
that has the management of the minstrel
show to be given to raise funds for the
reception expenses: H. P\ Lilk^ndVy,
chairman; Henry B. Faure. secretary,
and C. H. Turner, treasurer; Mrs. Ella

The programme will include a number
of new features, one of which is being
rehearsed in* private, and even the com
mittee has not been apprised of the char
acter of the surprise that Is to be spuing
on the audience. Among- those who ;ii" to

D. F. Nunan and the Knickerbocker
faiked with him in his p.iloon both yester
day and the day before. Only to the de
tectives has he denied himself. He has
been courteous enough, however, to cheer
them up from time to time with communi
cation* through his attorney, Thomas
Madden, to the effect that he was only
waiting until collection rlay passed, so
that he could Ret his friends together on
his bond and secure release from custody
the moment the warrant is served upon
him. Early yesterday morning Madden
{promised the detectives that he would
produce his man by 1 o'clock in the after-
noon. One o'clock came, and 2 o'clock.
When Madden showed up with an apology
for rhe non-materialization of Smoot, but
with the assurance that the saloon keeper
would he on deck In the morning. On this
assurance the detectives are resting, al
though the general impression was last
night that a descent upon the cellar of
Smoot's saloon would have been rewarded
by the capture of the man.
If Smoot is any sort of a man at all he
will not abuse the credulity of the San
Francisco police force. It is the easiest
thins that^ever came over the pike, and
It would be almost as bad as robbing chil
dren to deceive it again. He should be
grateful for the consideration that has
been shown him and at least appear in
handcuffs.
The cases against Smoot, McPherson
and Cllsham will probably be set Monday
morning for hearing, at least that is the
indication the court gave when it had
"Brick" and the putative "Davis" before
it yesterday morning. The two prisoners
were brought in from their cells shortly

A FILIPINO APPEAL.
The Actors From Manila Ask to Be
Allowed to Land and Pro
ceed to Omaha.
The fifteen Filipinos who arrived on the
Indiana en route to the Omaha Exposi
tion are ehating under their apparently
unnecessary detention by United States
Immigration Commissioner North. They
ciime here as actors to give representa
tions of the songs, dress and customs of
their country, and are surprised that
there should be so much delay in their
ca^e when other bodies of similar actors
have been freely admitted. They have
addressed a letter to The Call, of which
the following is a translation from the
Spanish:
To the Editor- of The Callâ My Dear Sir:
The Filipinos who arrived on the 216t mst. by
the steamer Indiana respectfully salute you
and ki?s your feet. The object of the present
writing is on account of the Imprisonment we
have been -obliged to suffer here without
knowing its cause, and for the purpose of
callins to your distinguished consideration
ourselves with the request that you will have
the kindness to insert these lines in your 11
--lustrous journal In order that they may reach
the ears of the respectable Governor of this
State, who we trust, without doubt, will char
itably grant us our speedy release.
For thi3 reason we ask this courtesy of
you, hoping that you may grant it to the
Filipinos, who are your most humble ser
vants. JOSE MIRANDA,
Representing the Party.
NATIONAL GUARD NOTES.
An Old Order in a New Form Issued.
No Revoking of Discharges.
The question of the power of the Adju-

j assistant adjutant general, as a clerk to
do certain work in connection with the
guard, having been submitted to the At-
I torney General, the assistant attorney
I general, to whom the matter was referred.
â  has -lied an opinion to the effect that the
i Adjutant General has the power to ap
point, consequently the appointment was
legal and the clerk is entitled to his
salary.
The Adjutant General has issued a gen
i eral order that all men who wish to en
list in the guard must undergo a physical
! examination similar to that had for the

Even Judge Treadwell took occasion t
announce early in the preliminary pr<

of the lawyers mentioned in the conspir

the p-irties concerned in procuring that

this occasion to refute utterly the insinu

SOLDIERS WERE THE GUESTS.
Last right was soldiers' night at the
Orpheum and the sick and wounded were
the theater's guests. They came in in two
big squads under the leadership of a hos
pital steward, and they filled a section of
seats that stretched from one side of the
theater to the other and took up ten or
twelve of the rows.
The Crpheum management had extended
to the men who came in on the Morgan
City the courtesies of the house for an
evening. There were at least three hun
dred of them. They came early and stayed
until the last, and they smoked Orpheum
cigars and drank beer at the theater"s
expease. and had a good time generally.
Those who knew nothing of the reception
wore surprised at first at the number of
soldiers in the audience, but it was ex
plained from the stage that the Orpheum
\v;is host and the men were guests, and
then the band struck a medley of national
airw. There were cheers and shouts as
each new favorite was given, and then
at the opening chords of the "Red, White
and Blue" the lines of blue and brown
rose, and the audience rose, too. and the
last 3f the stirring old tune was drown. .1
in cheers. It was the same when the
"Star-Spangled Banner" was played, and
when the flag was unfurled from the stage
the ceiling shook with the din.
After the show the men were marshaled
under the hospital steward again and the
cars took them back to the Presidio.
Town Talk.
The reason the public takes to Town
Talk is because It is always sure to lir.d
all original matter in this weekly. Town
Talk is entirely original, and there is
never a bit of reprinted matter In its '
columns, unless ;i verse from some an- '
cient poet, or a magazine paragraph
quoted for editorial comment. This week
Town Talk contains several original
verses and no less than three clever
sketches, besides many jokelets and bits
of interesting miscellany. The Saunterer's
pages are bestrewn with exclusive news
of social, club and political happenings,
out of town news from San Diego, Camp
Meeker, Santa Cruz and other places, all
written in the entertaining and vivacious
style for which Town Talk is famous.
The worlds of law. literature, stage and
music are well cared for by their re
spective writers, and a number of beau- i
tlful halftones appear in the issue. Ma- ;
dame de Pasquali as Marguerite is on the i
title page. * i
to Clisham. "and tell the court if he is
Thomas K. Davis."
"I don't know," was the reply, made
without even the barest glance at Clish
am.
"Well," said the Judge. "I will let the
matter go over till Monday, and by that
time I can determine whether or not I
will withdraw the warrant."
McPherson and CUsham were then
taken hack to the City Prison, from -which
the ex-policeman was released an hour
later upon the approval of his bond.
During the day M.pherson had a number
of callers, including- Harvey Brown and
('harles McDougall, who was closer than
; mortar to "Brick" in all his schemes, and
who. more than likely, will lie proceeded
agair,>*t criminally before the matter is
dropped. In the evening Mrs. McPherson
called on ber husband and spent an hour
j in his company, most of the time in tears.
At various times during the day it was
i evident to the merest onlooker tnat
! "Brick" was growing weary of detention
in prison, and had ceased to hope that
| any of his fair-weather friends would
come to his rescue with bail money. He
manifested his disgust to Detective Oih
| son, of whom he inquired whether or not
any of the fellows were squealing-, threat
j ening If they did to do a little squealing
himself. He also confided the cheering
1 information to the detective that he had
, given to Attorneys Brown and Thorne not
: less than JlOU.uuu worth of United States
! bonds each.
The story latks confirmation, but the
: police have received some corroboration
; of a part of the story told by Clisham. to
the effect that he had been given a "power
if attorney to collect moneys in China
town for "Brick" McPherson. The cor
roboration came in the mails from the
Chief of Police of Portland. Or., who had
forwarded, among other papers found in
â  the possession of "Davis." or Clisham, the
i following, written by the hand of Tsaac
N. Thorne and signed by A. W. MePher
Â»in. It reads:
Kn.>w all men by these presents, that I. Alex
ander W. McPberson of the city and county of
Pan Francisco, have made, constituted and ap
pointed, and by these presents do make. . . >n-

place my true and lawful attorney for me and,
in my name, place and stead t>> collect and re
ceive and receipt for all moneys and goods n< w
in the hands of Chan <"hlnt?, Kirn Lim. Ah Loy
and Song Wo due to me, to my use and for my
benefit.
Dated this 2Cth day of June. 1899.
In witness whereof I have hereunto set my
hand, the day and year above set forth In
presence of I. N. Thorne.
fSlgned.) ALEX W. McPHERSO.v
The detectives yesterday put in most of
their time in a search for victims of the
"dope dream" gang, the principals in
which seem to be McPherson and Me-
Dougall, and they have a long list of wit
nesses in addition to those already men
tioned by The Call who will take the
stand and testify substantially to the
same effect concerning the operations of
the conspirators.
