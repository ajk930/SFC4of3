MORE TROOPS
REQUIRED IN
PHILIPPINES
General Miles Advocates the
Sending of Reinforce-

SITUATION IS SERIOUS
Miller Also of the Opinion That
a Large Number of Men Are
Needed to Pacify Islands.
Special EHKpatoh to ThÂ« Call.
CALL, HEADQUARTERS. WEL
LINGTON HOTEL, WASHINGTON,
June 25. â Major General Miles is a
strenuous advocate of the dispatch <>f
large reinforcements to General Otis in
the Philippines.
The general declined to discuss the
military situation in the Philippines
other than to say that it was "serious,"
nor would he give his Idea of the num
ber of troops he thought should now
be sent to the Philippines to place the
archipelago under American control.
From tho War Department it is learn
ed that General Miles, as far back as
April, recommended that ten of the
volunteer regiments which the Presi
dent is authorized to raise under the
army reorganization law be organized
and sent to Manila. At that time the
officer? at army headquarters believed
this force sufficient to crush the rebel
lion, but in view of the strength de
veloped by the insurgents they are not
now so sanguine that ten regiments are
enough.
There, will be 15,700 men in ten regi
ments, the advisability of raising which
the War Department is now consider
ing, but well-Informed officers pay the
force of 50,000 men which General Otis
will have when reinforcements are
; 1 at his disposal will not be suffi
cient.
General Marcus P. Miller, who recent
ly arrived from the Philippines, where
he was Governor of Iloilo, has been liv
ing here since his return. General
Miller's views as to the number of men
required for the subjugation of the
glands is very different from that of
.General Otis. He believes 65,000 men at
least are required, 30,000 for the control
'^f Luzon and the remainder for the re
storation of peace and order in the
other islands. General Miller's views
. coincide,, .jvith^ i Qejneral,JLÂ»awtqn<'s_ and
other olflctf'rs subordinate to General
â¢Otis.
There is no truth In the story that
General Miles has applied to be sent to
Manila, It is equally untrue, it is as
serted by Acting Secretary Meiklejohn,
that General Otis has cabled that he
will will bp compelled to retreat unless
promptly reinforced.
DENIAL OF REPORTED
CABLEGRAM FROM OTIS
ADAMS, Mass., June 25.â Mr. Cnrtel
you. acting secretary to the President,
authorized me to state to-day that
there was not a word of truth in the
report that General Otis had sent a dis
patch to Washington, which was re
peated to the President, stating his in
ability to conquer the Filipinos and to
hold the ground already gained.
"The story," said Mr. Cortelyou, "is
a pure fabrication." Ho added the re
port that the President had sent a
message of thanks to Governor Roose
velt for his offer to furnish troops for
the Philippines was equally false. He
Mid the President had no official
knowledge of Governor Roosevelt's of
fer.
President MoKinley passed a quiet
day. He attended the < 'ongrogational

TRAILING THE MAN WHO
ROBBED THE ALAMEDA
Conclusive Proof That the Purloiner
of Gold Has Escaped to'the
Orient.
HONOLULU, Jan.- is.â it is almost
certain that the chest of $25,000 in gold
lost from the steamship Alameda left
the ship at this port. Jn fact. Marshal
Drown has in his possession to-day al
most conclusive evidence that such was
the case. The man who, it is believed,
robbed the ship is also known, but has
fled beyond the pale of Hawaiian law.
He is now in Japan, and eventually
may be caught, for the Oceanic Steam
ship Company has a powerful detective
agency on his tracks.
.. The man is supposed to be Wilson, an
Australian. He has been suspected of
other such robberies between Sydney
and Auckland. When the Alameda
gailed from Australia, this man was a
passenger for San Francisco. He left
t.he boat here on the 2iJth. On June Ist
he sailed by the Gaelic for tho Orient.
.Marshal Brown does not know just
h<>w the thi-f brought his treasure
ashore, but the transfer is admittedly
not a hard matter. It is presumed the
thief had accomplices and they brought
It Â«>ff on a number of visits aboard the
Khip at the dock. The coin would
weigl) abo-ut 100 pounds.
The loss of the money was discovered
when the Alameda was within two days
of San Francisco. The densest cloud of
mystery surrounded the disappearance
of the box. Chief Lees of the San Fran
cisco police too-k a chance shot and
wrote Marshal Brown the bare particu
lars. The latter immediately began an
investigation with the success here re
ported.
By the steamer to-day the San Fran
cisco Chief of Police will be advised
concerning the suspected man and that
he has gone to the Orient and probably
a detective will at once be sent to
Japan and Chita. The supposition here
is that the man will double back and
in a few weeks will be ranching or do
ing something else in an out-of-the
way Australian district.. J

President Loubet Signs Orders
Making Some Most Signifi

FpeÂ«-ial Cable to The Call and the New Toric
Herald. Copyrighted, 1899, by James Gor
don Bennett.
PARIS, June 25.â At the Cab
inet council to-day M. Loubet,
the President, signed orders
making the following changes:
M. Bertrand, Procurator Gen
eral to the Appeal Court, and M.
Feuilloley, Public Prosecutor,
are both removed. M. Bulot,
Advocate General, Is appointed
Public Prosecutor. M. Lombard,
whose dismissal on account of
the Deroulede trial has been
much criticised as unjust, is
appointed Advocate General. M.
Bertrand's successor has not yet
been appoint 1.
General Hartschmidt, General
Roget, Colonel ~Saxe and Colonel
Cobertln are transferred to other
garrisons.
The Premier, M. Waldeck-
Roussc-au, will read a draft of
his speech in Parliament to
morrow, -which will be very
brief, merely announcing that
the new Ministry has no aim
hut to follow out the order of
the day voted on June 12, on
the motion of Joseph Ruau,
Democratic Radical, represent
ing the Second District of St.
Gaudens, which was as follows:
"The I'hamhiT is determined
to support only a Government
resolved to defend vigorously
republican institutions and to
secure public order, and passes
to the order of the day."
PARIS, June 25.â 1t is like building
upon quicksand to try to prognosticate
the fate of the new Ministry tomor
row. _' Still, .the wind seems blowing 1 in
favor of supporting it. As a matter of
fact, surprise at the rather hetero
genuous composition of the Cabinet has
been the much more pronounced senti
ment than hostility toward it, with the
exception of the virulent Dreyfus
section of the pressâ that is to say,
those papers that are pledged up to the
neck to keep Dreyfus guilty. Even the
opposition press has regarded the min
istry with more sorrow than anger.
If you take the vote of the Paris
morning journals as a whole, the result
will be decidedly for the Waldeck-Rous
seau Government. Fourteen papers
support it, eight oppose and three
straddle the fence. Those who favor it
are the Amore and Le Siecle, both re
visionist organs; Le Figaro, conserva
tive; La Fronde, Le Matin, Le Petit
parislenne (which, by the way, be
longs to Jean Dupuy, the new Minister
of Agriculture), and Le Petit Bleu, all
Republican organs; La Lanterne, La
Petite Republique, Le Voltaire, Le So
cialiste, Le Radical, Le Rappel, Le
Dixneuvieme Siecle, all radical papers,
and Le Solell, organ of the Conserva
tive monarchical party.
Those opposing the Government are
LAntorite, Cassaignac's Bonapartist
sheet; LEcho de Paris, Le Petit Jour
nal, L'lntransigeant, all of which dub
themselves Nationalist papers, what
ever that may mean; L'Eclair, Repub
lican; Le GauW,-is, monarchical; La
Libre Parole, anti-Semitic, and Le Jour
nal dv People, which is openly anarch
istic in its doctrines.
The straddlers are L'Evenement, Le
Gil Bias and Le Journal. Therefore,
even if the undecided papers should
I throw in their lot with the opposition,
the Government has three majority in
the morning press. This is not so bad,
and at any rate disposes of the claim
of the Nationalists that the whole press
regards the new Ministry with stupe
faction. The evening papers are di
j vided upon fairly the same basis. Le
I Temps and Le Journal Dcs Debats, be
ing Conservative, support the Govern
ment, though without enthusiasm. La
Pa trie and Le Soir are enthusiastic
enough, but against it.
General De Gallifet's letter to chiefs
of the army made a noticeable impres
sion. Le Siecle says he has laid down
the law in very clear terms. He should
ers the responsibility for the chiefs, but
reminds them' they are personally re
sponsible to him, and he is not the man
to let them forget.
If any officer feels Inclined to reply to
the journalist through the medium of an
order of the day, read to the assembled
troops, with a brass band just lined up
for the ceremony, he may be sure that
punishment will be set rolling down the
line by General De Gallifet until he
lands on the offender's head. Officers
who sinned in this respect have already
had an illustration of this and have
been transferred to other posts in the
provinces as a warning. /
"Spare the rod and spoil the child."
The army is Gallifefs child, and he will
not see it spoiled.
BREST, June 25.â The French first
class cruiser Tage put to sea this even
ing, the official explanation being that
she has gone to experiment with car
rier pigeons. She is, however, a much
larger cruiser than the Sf ax, which is
bringing Captain Dreyfus, and the dis
patch of a big vessel with carrier pig
eons is quite unprecedented. Usually a
torpedo boat is sent, and the opinion
therefore gains ground that the Tage
has gone to meet the Sfax and to take
Captain Dreyfus on board. The pigeons
can be used to announce the transfer,
and the Tage might proceed to another
port to land the prisoner. As against
this theory and as an indication that
the landing of Dreyfus will be effected
here, there is the fact that a large num
ber of gendarmes , from the -â  country
around Brest are arriving or expected
to arrive to-night. The treasurer of the

In the Cherche-Mldl Prison a fortnight
ago. The accuser of Dreyfus and Pic
quart is still held in absolute solitude.
Neither his wife nor his attorney has
been allowed to see him since he was ar

Notwithstanding the precautions, it has
leaked out that De Clam sought to bribe
the guards to get him a pistol or poison.
A subaltern immediately reported this to
his superiors, who changed the whole
guard, placing in charge oid and tried
soldiers, considereu proof against tempta
tions. Later, it is .said, De Clam wrote
to a kinsman that he had always acted
in the Dreyfus case according to the
best information and in strict loyalty to
the orders of military superiors. Never
theless he declared himself a prey to a
harrowing doubt since the revelations to
the Court o f Cassation, and begs piteous

and escape the odium of a criminal trial.

; How effective" and fatal this method of

In the first battle at Bronkhorst Spruit,
near Middleburg, Colonel Anstruther's

HONDURAS MUST PAY
THE PFARS INDEMNITY
United States Government Is Deter-

Delay.
WASHIOTON, June 25.â Official
Washington is waiting with some im
patience for a reply from the Govern
ment of Honduras to the demand of
Minister Hunter for $10,000 for the heirs
of Frank Pears, killed by a Hondurian
soldier in February. Unless the reply
be forthcoming within the next few
days instructions will be sent to Mr.
Hunter to call for an immediate reply.
The administration does not propose
to permit Honduras to be dilatory in
this matter, believing that determina
tion and constant pressure will not only
result in the payment of the indem
nity, but in better treatment of Ameri
cans there in the future.
Honduras sought the good offices of
Guatemala to persuade the United
States to accept arbitration several
weeks ago, but arbitration was not ac
cepted. It js presumed that Honduras
is trying to find a loophole through
which she can escape compliance with
the American demand, but the admin
istration is determined she shall pay
the money, and pay soon, even if it be
necessary to send a squadron to com
pel action.
So far as Nicaragua Is concerned, the
authorities are satisfied that with the
gunboat Vixen at Bluefields the Ameri
cans will be given fair treatment. The
authorities are daily expecting to re
ceive from Nicaragua a demand for the
money the Managua government as
serts was rightfully collected by her
agents from American merchants at
Bluefields during the insurrection, and
which has been deposited with the
British Consul pending a settlement of
the controversy.

REVIEW OF REGIMENT
Memorial Services Also Held, at
Which the Deeds of the Brave
Troops Are Extolled.
Sr>ecial Dispatch to The Call.
LAS VEGAS, N. M., June 25.âMemo
rial service was the first thing on the
Rough Riders' reunion programme to
day. They were held at 11 o'clock this
morning at the Duncan Opera House,
and Rev. Thomas A. Uzzell, pastor of
the People's Tabernacle of Denver, Col.,
preached the memorial sermon. He
said that the soldier who is forced to
remain behind is worthy of praise and
recognition as well as the man who is
at the front. The Rough Riders, he de
clared, have by their acts at San Juan
and in the fighting around Santiago
succeeded in writing one of the bright
est pages in American history. Their
deeds would be read by coming genera
tions and would enkinale admiration for
true heroism.
Lafe Young, editor of the lowa State
Capital, then delivered an address. Mr.
Young served with the Rough Riders
and his recital of the regiment's experi
ence at Tampa and San Antonio found
a responsive echo in the hearts of the
assembled Rough Riders. "The Fourth
of July," he t said, "is our national
Christmas, commemorating the birth of
the nation, but the Rough Riders' cele
bration should be its Easter, for it
marked the resurrection. It remained
for the Spanish war to bridge the
bloody chasm, to put Old Glory every
where, to wind up the late unpleasant
ness with the new battle hymn of the
republic, "There Will Be a Hot Time in
the Old Town To-night."
"On the plains of Cuba," he conclud
ed, "when I saw the sons of veterans
marching beneath the flag which their
I fathers died to save, and the sons of
Confederates clothed in the same uni
i form, bearing the . same arms and
I marching under the same flag, and the
I sons of former slaves accoutered and
I armed like the others, with, the flag
I above them and. the same nun,.
their hearts, and lUO native-burn ruti
i blood Indians selected in the same lines
and aiding the same cause when I saw
these I made a vow to high heaven
never to be a partisan again, that
henceforth and forever all Americans
should look alike to me."
The regimental parade took place this
afternoon at 4 o'clock. The regiment
formed at Camp Cochran and marched
to the tournament grounds, six blocks
away. Colonel Roosevelt rode as com
mander, accompanied by a staff of offi
cers. At the tournament grounds Colo
nel Roosevelt occupied a box reserved
for him and the guests of the regiment.
As the Rough Riders passed and re
passed the grand stand in performing
! their evolutions, Colonel Roosevelt
stood with bared head. Each troop was
preceded by its respective captain, as
far as they were present, on the occa
sion. The scene was witnessed by fully
10,000 people.
While the review was going on rain
clouds were banking heavily in the
north, and Chairman Whitmore of the
local committee on arrangements re
quested the colonel to hurry the move
ments of the Rough Riders, ostensibly
on account of the approaching showers.
Colonel Roosevelt complied with the re
quest, and in another instant the troop
ers were standing at attention in front
of the grand stand. This was a neat bit
of strategy, and before Colonel Roose
velt could realize why he was being
spoken to Hon. Frank Springer, acting
on behalf of the people of New Mexico,
began his speech, presenting Colonel
Roosevelt with a medal.
The medal is pendant from bar
chains, V shaped, with ends attached to
the bar and joined to the medal at the
center. On the bar is the wording,
"Colonel Theodore Roosevelt." Between
the bar and the medal the coat of arms
of New Mexico is engraved. On the
medal proper are crossed sabers, and
above them is the monogram "R. R.
R." Below the sabers is the wording,
"Presented by the citizens of New McxÂ»
ico, Las Vegas, N. M., June 24, 1899."
On the circular edge of the medal
proper are the words "San Juan," "Las
Guaslmas" and "Santiago." The dia
mond in the center is just below the
sabers.
The presentation was a genuine sur
prise to Colonel Roosevelt. Mr. Spring
er handed the medal to his young
daughter. Miss Eva, who pinned it on
the lappel of Colonel Roosevelt's Rough
Rider blouse. The recipient was visibly
affected and responded as follows:
Justice Springer, and to you. Miss
Springer, and to you, my fellow-Ameri
cans'of New Mexico, 1 want to say I can
not express In words how deeply I am
touched by what you have done. I prize
this gift more, than anything else that
could have oeen given to me, coming as
it does and In the way it does and from
those from -whom it comes. For it comes
on the anniversary of a day fateful in the
annals of the West. Twenty-three years
ago Ouster rode to his death with his gal
lant men at the Rosebud, adding his
share in the "winning of the West"â in
the upbuilding of the West, which you
have, all of you upbuiltâ bringing up your
section level in patriotism, level in high
ness of purpose, with all that there is in
this nation. I cannot say how glad I have
been to come here. I never was in New
Mexico before, but I have never felt like
a stranger for one moment among you.
(Applause.) I claim the same right that
each of your sons claim of "lory and take
pride in the name and fame of New
Mexico. I am an American as you are
Americans, and you and I alike have the
right to claim as our own every acre and
rod of country from Maine to Oregon,
from Florida to California. (Applause.)
All I shall say is if New Mexico wants to
be a State you can count me in, and I will
go to Washington to speak for you or do
anything you wish. iLong and continued
applause.)

HONOLULU, Juno IS.â Bubnnio
plague is held by the local health
authorities to exist in tho corpse of a
Chinese steerage passenger on board
the steamship Nippon Marti, lying since
yesterday morning off the harbor of
j Honolulu. For this cause tho Board of
I Health ordered the vessel into quaran
tine for seven days. The alternative ia
I to have the Nippon Maru refused both
I admission into the harbor and the land-
I ing of passengers arid freight.
When tho steamship China arrived,
from San Francisco on Thursday with
out any cable advices regarding the
Nippon after her departure from Hnns;
kong on time, conjectures upon the
cause of the steamer's being six days
overdue were balanced between quar
antine and breakdown. The vessel's
arrival here early yesterday morning
proved the quarantine guess correct. It
als'i brought the community face to
face with the stern duty of self-protec-
I tion against the black Oriental scourge.
The Nippon Maru Balled from Hong
kong on May 21. and Shanghai on the
24th. She arrived at Nagasaki two days
later, and there dispatched all of her
business without. impediment. The
steamer was leaving the harbor of
Nagasaki under a full head of steam
when a Chinese steerage passenger
died. Captain Allen put the ship back
to port rather than take any chances
of having it become a plague ship or
detained under suspicion of being such
at other ports of call ahead.
Although the ships doctor did not
consider it a case of plague, the body
was sent ashore at Nagasaki for exam
ination. The Japanese port physicians,
however, pronounced the death as hav
ing been caused by plague. They de
clared the corpse infested with plague
baii"i. t and by tlvir on )Â»r ft was cre
matea. Trie Nippon Maru wrai ;.t. the
same time ordered into quarantine for
seven days.
Having fulfilled her prescribed term
of quarantine, the steamship sailed
from Nagasaki on June 8. She made
Kobe and Yokohama all right, having
had no further case of sickness.
I and sailed from the latter port for
! Honolulu on June 8. The Rio de. Janeiro
| had sailed for Honolulu the previous
day, but was not sighted here until
yesterday evening â about twelve hours
later than the Nippon Maru. The Rio
| brought a clean bill of health and was
admitted to dock in the harbor. Sh*
sailed at 3 o'clock this afternoon.
Upon the arrival of the Nippon off the
harbor she was boarded by Dr. F. R.
Day, port physician and member of the
Board of Health. She reported the
death of a Chinese steerage passenger
on June 14. The man hud been ill but
twenty-two hours and the ship's physi
cian gave the cause as uraemic convul
sions, due to kidney troubles. The body
had been kept on board embalnird.
Dr. Day at the same time received
an official report of the quarantining
at Nagasaki from Dr. Rokkaku. medi
cal inspector at Yokohama for the
Hawaiian Government. Taking into
consideration this report frmn Japan,
together with the fact that the victim
had died after only twenty-two hours'
illness, he ordered the Bteamship into
quarantine until he came ashore and
reported.
Having made his report to the board,
the port physician returned to the
ship, taking with him Dr. Carmichael,
inspector of the United States Hospital
Marine Service. The two doctors made
a post mortem examination of the dead
Chinaman. They found the condition
of the lungs, the bronchial tubes and
the kidneys, as well as that of the
pericardium and peritonital cavities,
strongly suspicious of the plague. Some
specimens of the fluids and glands
were brought ashore for microscopical
examination, which being made strong
ly supported the diagnosis of the phy
sicians. The only absolute proof, how
ever, is to be found in the cultivation
of the germs. This pro* ess will take
three or four days. As the matter
stands, though, the appearance of the
bacillus is identical with that of speci
mens of the plague bacillus brought
from Japan two years ago by Dr. C. B.
Wood.
These facts were all laid before a
special meeting of the Board of Health
yesterday afternoon. The board pre
scribed a strict quarantine for the
Nippon Maru. It proposed a period of
seven days after disinfection. Should
the proposition bo declined, the ship
will not be allowed to land either pas
sengers or freight.
There are eight saloon passengers for
Honolulu, including Mr. and Mrs. H. F.
Wichman and Dr. W. T. Monsarrat.
Mr. Wichman is the leading jeweler of
this city. Dr. Monsarrat Is the
veterinary inspector of the Hawaiian
Government; who left here in a trans
port carrying army horses and mules to
Manila, under engagement by the
United States military authorities. The
ship has 750 tons of cargo for this
port.
Dr. Wood, a member of the Board of
Health, said to The Call correspondent:
"The necessity for quarantining any
passengers landing here being decided,
the possibility is thereby admitted that
the disease may develop among them at
quarantine. Unlike some other dis
eases to be guarded against. th*Â»
plague is known to be communicable
through the medium of rats and other
vermin. It is absolutely impossible to
disinfect tho ship properly with about
800 people on board. If, however, the
ship accepts quarantine, it must bs
afforded. The passengers would be
fumigated before and after landing at
Quarantine Tsland, and there treated to
the chemical bath, etc., and the through
passengers returned to the vessel when
she had been completely disinfected.
The captain of the steamer does not
admit that it was the plague of which
his steerage passenger died, but the
Board of Health physicians are almost
, positive that it was nothing else."2

WORK OF THE
FISH COMMISSION
Past Year Was a Most
Successful One.
Sl>ecial Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. June 25.â The work of
the Fish Commission is practically com
pleted for this year. According to the
officials of the commission, when th
ports are sent in July 1. they will
that it has been the roost successful year
in the history of the commission. The
great bulk of the work has !â â¢
collection and distribution of th<
fry of commercial food fish, and this year
more cod. white fish. pike, perob,
f.at fifih and lobster have been planted
than ever before.
Fully as many shad have been planted
this year as last, when the high v.
mark in Bhftd propagation was reached.
The gTeat commercial value of thr work
done by the Fish Commission can be best i
illustrated In the case of shad. The catch |
of shad in 1886 was five million. The sys
tematic collection of eggs and distribution
of shad fry since that year have ln.ci
the catch annuatly until this year U
reached 13,006.000; an increase of 150 p*t â 
cent In fo;;: rs. At the same time
the coet of shad ha.Â« been <W
the consumer more than 30 ]".-r cent.
The value of the catch this year was
upward of â  has been
obtained by the commission at a total ex
penditure of $;2.000. For so successful was
the experiment made several years ago
for the introduction of shad and striped ;
bass on the Pacific Coast, thai planting
of those two food fish on that coast lias
been suspended. The shad catch on the
Pacific now ranges between mie and two
million annually. The total cost of intro
ducing the shad into Pacific waters was
but $5000. So plentiful has the striped bass j
become in the Pacific Coast streams since
their introduction that they can be pur
chased in the market? of the coast cheaper
the year around than in the Eastern mar
kets. "When they were first introduced
they brought $1 a pound.
The work at the California stations
this year has been confined to the propa
gation of the commercial salmon and the
sock-eye and steel-head trout. CK'er 40,
--000,000 eggs have been distributed fr>m
these stations. From the five On
stations on the Columbia Rlv I
fry have been planted in the Pacific
Coast streams. The new station at Ba
kers Lake, Wash., established for iik 1
propagation of bluehack and Bilver
salmon will begin operations July 1. In
the Rocky Mountain region there are sta
tions in Montana. Colorado and South
Dakota for the propagation of Eastern
brook trout, grayling, mountain and
black-spotted trout. From th< se sta
tions 6.000.000 fry were distributed in the
Ftrc-ams of Colorado, Washington, Idaho,
Montana, South Dakota, Kew Mexico,
Aiizona and Indian Territory. From me
Middle States stations in lowa, Illinois,
Missouri and Texas for the propagation
of brook and rainbow trout, black bass
and croppie, 1,000,000 fry of all kinds were
distributed tn stocking private ponds and
Btreams and some public waters. From
tho stations on the Great Lakes, where
the white fish, lake trout, herring, pike,
perch and wall-eyed pike are collected,
7n0.000.00n eggs of all kinds were taken
and 500,000,000 fry planted. At the shad
stations at Bullockville. Ga., Edenton,
N. C. Bryans Point. Ya., -Havre do Grace
and Gloucester shad eggs were
collected and 240,000,000 fry planted In all
the important streams from Florida to
Massachusetts. There tffe stations in
Virginia and Tennessee for the propaga
tion of black bass and trout, but these
have done little this year.
In Massachusetts there are two of the
largest marine fish culture stations in tne
world. At these the cod, pollock, flatfish
(flounder) and lobsters are propagated.
river 800,000,000 cod <-t:gs were collected
here and between 150 .
fry distributed. Over -Roooofio flatfish
were planted. Tlir- lobster season has not
yet closed. Over 100,000,900 i-irus have al
ready been taken and it is expected that
50,000.000 more will be taken before the
close of the season.
CLAIMS HE CAN MAKE
GOLD AND DIAMONDS
Indiana Man Displays Splendid Sam
ples in Support of His Con
tention.
KOKOMO, Ind., June 25.â A Kokomo
man claims to have discovered a
process for making gold. The alleged
discoverer Is Dr. Hercules Ogle, a prac
titioner of fifty years' standing in this
community. In the rear of his little of
fice is a dingy shed which the doctor
uses for a laboratory. On the shelves
there are thousands of pebbles of all
varieties, specimens of rocks, parcels of
sandâ in fact, samples of everything
that is to be found in the bowels of the
earth.
"It is all in knowing how," said the
old doctor to a newspaper man, as he
displayed a handful of nuggets. "These
are pure gold and they came from a
point within five miles of Kokorao. Na
ture provides the elements for all good
things, and man is expected to have in
telligence enough to use them, but does
not. I have been prow Hog around
among the elements that enter into the
construction of earth, and while I have
learned a few things there are millions
of other good things waiting for the
hand of intelligence to bring them
forth. The combinations and variations
are almost Inexhaustible.
"These stones you see here have ele
ments of gold, and there are diamond?.
in that pile over there. Here are some
of the manufactured ones, and real
sparklers they are, so a number of Jew
elers have told me. Book chemistry is
all right so far as it goes, but it is the
practical work that counts."
He refuses to inform the public of the
combination of elements that produces
gold and diamonds, but he has speci
mens that have passed the most critical
analysis and numerous letters and re
ports from experts and assayers pro
nouncing them the genuine article.
KRUGER TALKS
PEACE BUT
BUYS GUNS
Continued from First Papc.
to ask for an armistice, and later agreed
t" ,i peace practically dictated by the
Boers. In this fight the British had
every advantage of position on the sum
mit .if Majuha Hi!!. The Boers attacked
early in the morning and under some
desultory firing advanced in three parties
uj> the hill. The British were outflanked
and surrounded and a deadly fire poured
in upon them from all sides. As usual,
all the officers were poon shot down and
General Sir George Colley was killed.
The whole British force, among whom
were the Gordon Highlanders and other
equally famous regiments, the best in
the British army, broke and fled before a
force inferior to their own. Many more
fell as they ran headlong down the hill
under the fire of the sharpshooters and a
large number were taken prisoners. So
disastrous a defeat has seldom fallen
upon a British force.
The Boers then had but few breech
loading rifles, but at the present time
they are supplied with the very latest and
best of arms and munitions of war.
their expenditures therefor since the
Jamieson raid in 1896 amounting, accord
ing to the best authorities, to nearly
$7,000,000. They have no standing army,
hut every able-bodied male between IS
and 60 is liable to military service in case
of war, which gives an available force of
some 38,000 men.
There are two foot and two mounted
volunteer corps, numbering 1170 men,
which are subsidized by the Government,
besides some batteries of horse artillery.
Except these the Boers know nothing of
drill or marching in line or column, but,
after their own fashion, they are fighters
not to be despised.
AMERICAN OFFICERS
START A RIOT IN CUBA
Several Persons Injured During the
Melee They Created to Avoid
Arrest.
CIENFUEGOS, Cuba, June 25.â Three
American officers, who had been creat
ing a disturbance In a house of ill-re
pute and had resisted arrest, entered a
carriage and began firing their revolv
ers, wounding Policeman Ortega. Other
policemen returned the fire and Joined
by a mob pursued the carriage to the
railway station, where American pick
ets were guarding wagons and a safe
containing money.
The troops, mostly recruits, on seeing
that the officers were in danger, en
trenched themselves behind the wagons
and began shooting, wounding two po
licemen and three civilians. A wealthy
planter who was passing in a carriage
with his children was struck by a
Krag-Jorgensen ball, receiving serious
injury.
Senor Frias, the Mayor, the Cuban
General Esquerra and Major Bowman,
commanding the Americans, rode
through the crowd, begging the people
to restrain themselves and ordering the
troops to stop. Their attempts were
finally successful. The corporal in
charge of the pickets says he did not
give an order to fire, but people who
were near insist that they heard him
give such a command.
Indignation runs high, but there is no
fear of further trouble. The offending
officers have been locked up.
NOTHING TO SAY OF
SENATORIAL ASPIRATIONS
Alger Does Not Think His Former
Statements Will Embarrass the
Administration.
WASHINGTON. June 25.-Secretary Al
ger returned to the capital this evening
and said he had nothing to add to what he
said in Chicago regarding his candidacy
for the Senate. He did not intend to re
sign from the Cabinet, as the campaign
for Senator would not begin until next
year. He did not see how it could em
barrass the administration for him to re
main in the Cabinet after he announced
his views on trusts, but that was a ques
tion for the President alone to decide.
He had always been frank with the Presi
dent and the President had always known
he could have his resignation whenever
It would relieve the administration of em
barransment.
He did not pretend to speak for the ad
ministration in his view upon trusts, but
spoke as a private citizen concerning
what he regarded as one of the dangers
of the country. No members of the Cabi
net could commit the administration upon
any question, as was shown by Secretary-
Gage's position regarding currency re
form expressed in his official report, but
which was not indorsed by. the President.
THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JUNE 26, 1899.
COLUMBIA HAS
HER TRIAL TRIP
Successful Beyond All
Expectations.
DISTANCED THE DEFENDER
AMERICA'S CUP CONSIDERED
SAFE FOR ANOTHER YEAR.
Race in an Eight-Knot Breeze Showed
the New Boat Twenty Seconds
a Mile Faster Than
the Old.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEWPORT, June 25.â The first trial trip
of the new America's cup defender Co
lumbia, which took place in Narragansott
Bay to-day, was more successful than
either her builders or her owners had rea
son to hope. Not only dTd the new boat
show herself to be able in every particu
lar but she met the old , racer, the De
fender, in a friendly brush of a mile to
windward and vanquished her Will) tho
greatest ease.
Tho race between the flyers, which w::n
over in rtve minutes, was sailed in an
eight-knot breeze under the same condi
tions, each boat carrying three lower
sails, rvith sheets well flattened. It took
the Columbia about three minutes, sailing
from the Defender's weather auarter, to
blanket her, and in five minutes she ;-is
one hundred yards ahead, going past the
old cup defender as if the latter was an
chored.
Under these circumstances it would
seen) ;is if the Columbia were from fifteen
to twenty seconds faster a mile than tho
Defender, and if she can make the same
gain in a hard blow the safety of the
America's cup will be almost aasureo.
The trip to-day was the builder a trial,
and although the managing owner, I
Oliver Iselin. and a number of his yacht
ing friends were on board, the Colum
bia's designer. Nat Herreshoff, was In
charge, and after the sail down the bay
tii.- boat was towed back to Bristol for a
few minor repairs. It is expected that
she will have another trial Thursday, and
by the end of the week will be formally
turned over to Mr. Iselin. In the mean
time her Interior finings will be finished
and her bowsprit, which apparently start
ed in the socket during to-day's brush
with the Defender, will need some atten
tion. Before the Columbia left for Bris
tol this afternoon Mr. Iselin expressed
himself as being more than satisfied with
her. and it was a happy lot of yachts
man that watched her performance and
went to Bristol with her to-night.
GOES TO EXPLORE THE
"FOSSIL CEMETERY"
Professor Crook to Head An Expedi
tion for Scientific Research in
Wyoming.
CHICAGO, June 25.â Professor A. R.
! Crook of the Northwestern University,
i who in 1887 made one of the first geo
logical explorations of Russia, traveling
as a guest of the Czar, has accepted an
invitation of the Northern Pacific Rail
road to make researches this summer
in the famous tract known as "the
j fossil cemetery of the world." This
j region is part of Wyoming, and lies in a
I many-colored desert north of Laramie,
j a spot rich in various minerals, espe
j cially gold. The professor, however, is
; indifferent to the possibility of opening
up a vein of -yellow mPta!, and has c<>n
[ centrated his hopes 6n finding gigantic
fossils of reptiles, especially thÂ«
stegosaurus, a monster which appears
to be a pet of the professor and which
j rejoices in the possession of a Rocky
i Mountain range of armor plates twenty
i feet in length along its backbone.
To secure this and other scientific
treasures. Professor Crook will travel
300 miles on a bronco," with his portion
of camp utensils slung across his
shoulders. Five sturdy young students
of Northwestern University have been
picked out to share the honors and help
| carry the frying pans of the expedi-
I tion.
"No milk and water men will do on
| this trip," announced the professor.
"From the twenty applicants I have
chosen five men who are good geo
logists, good horsemen, good shots, and,
above all, good natured companions.
Permission to go is a sort of reward
of merit, and all the chosen have dis
tinguished themselves in the classroom.
"From discoveries already made, wo
expect to find in Wyoming the Bronto
saurus, the Atlantosaurus, the Dino
saurus and the platebearing stego
saurus. The geology of Wyoming is
also of great interest, as the geological
i i formations are on a grand scale. The
! valleys of the region are the paleon
. J tological treasure house of the world.
Wyoming has givÂ«Â»n more than any
other spot on earth to the museums of
scientific Institutions. The fossil ceme
â¢ tery. however, is wider than "Wyoming,
and covers Western Nebraska, North
ern Kansas and South Dakota. We
owe to it nearly all our best knowledge
â¢ of the triassic, Jurassic and cretaceous
times."

Venerable President.
OLD CLASSMATES PRESENT

OF HIS OWN GRADUATION.
; As He Addressed a Graduating Class
for the Last Time His Voice
Was Choked With
Emotion.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW HAVEN, June 25.â President Tim
othy Dwlght, the venerable retiring presi
dent of Yale University, to-day preached
his last baccalaureate sermon before the
graduating classes of the academic and
scientific departments. The occasion was
also the fiftieth anniversary of President
Dwlpht's own graduation. Many of his
old classmates were in the chapel. The
graduating class occupied the greater part
of the body of the Battel Chapel. All of
them wore the academic robe, and with
them were many visitors from out of
town.
President Dwight's address was largely
I of a retrospective and personal nature. At
| the close of the sermon he addressed a
' benediction in the most solemn and im
i presslre manner. His voice often choked
with emotion. His words were:
And now. my fellow students, and may I not
almost say my classmates of the class or 18J9,
let me ask you to rise. The words which I
have spoken 'to you have had a very personal
i meaning. So much of the personal was there
in them that they may have seemed more
1 adapted to a friendly conversation than to Dâ¬

For you it 'is still morning.
I have tried to speak to you of what life

i They will meet many of you, and some of you

MOURNED AS DEAD
FOR MANY MONTHS
Frank Connolly, Formerly of the
Keene Dramatic Company, Shows
Up nt St. Louis.
ST. LOUIS. June 25.â The Post-Dis
patrh says that Frank Connolly, who
was acting as treasurer of the Thomas
W. Keene Pramtio Company in the
spring of ISOB, when he mysteriously
disappeared from McVicker's Theater,
in Chicago, has turned up in St. Louis
after a varied experience. It was be
lieved at the time that Connolly had
been foully dealt with, but the police
were unable to find the missing man.
According to Mr. Connolly's story, he
had supper that night with a woman
friend from Pittsburg. After that, un
til two weeks later, when he regained
his senses in a freight car near Mat
toon Ills., everything was a blank to
him.' He was minus $400 in money and
several hundred dollars' worth of jew
elry. He was taken to a hospital,
where he recovered from a severe ill
ness, which was the result of his hav
ing been drugged.
Thinking himself disgraced and fear
ing to fare his friends, Connolly went
to Cuba and acted as correspondent for
a number of papers during the war. He
made no attempt to conceal his identity
and apparently nobody knew him. On
his coming to St. Louis an old friend
of Mr. Connolly met and recognized
him.
CYCLONE'S HAVOC IN
A NEBRASKA VILLAGE
OHAMA, June 25.â A special to the
Bee from Bradley, Neb., says: Early
this morning a "twister" struck this
thriving village and partly wrecked it.
The storm came from the north with a
tremendous roar and aroused every
body from bed. It first struck the two
story brick block owned by Charles
Nash of New York and occupied by a
drug store and general merchandise
store below and the Methodist Society
upstairs. The building was totally
wrecked, entailing a loss, including
merchandise and. furnishings, of $10,000.
Floyd A. Watworth was caught in the
debris and seriously hurt.
Across the street the postoffice was
totally wrecked. The buildin" was oc
cupied by William Miller and valued at
$1000. Corliss' general store was un
roofed, the residence of David Magnus
was badly wrecked. Rev. Dr. Foutch
lost a carriage house and barn and
John Jones a barn. The ground was
plowed up by the wind and some stock
killed.
SMYRNA FIG WILL
BE A SUCCESS HERE
WASHINGTON, June 25.â The Agricul
tural Department has issued a bulletin
treating of the probable success of the
efforts of the department to establish the
Smyrna fig industry in California. It ap
pears that the fruiting of the Smyrna fig
is dependent upon the Introduction from
Southern Europe and the establishment in
California of a little insect which fertil
izes the fig.
Experimental introductions of the in
sect were thereupon begun and some of
them brought over n 1898 have succeeded
in penetrating the closed flowers of the
Capri figs growing at Fresno, making the
first step of the experimental work a suc
cess. The bulletin adds: "Since the in
sect has maintained itself for an entire
year, there is reason to suppose that it
will continue to breed and that California
in the near future will be able to place a
fig upon the market which will possess
the same superior flavor as that which
has given the imported Smyrna figs their
pre-eminent commercial rank."
Death of "Fatty" Walsh.

feature of the saengerfest will be the
performance of the Alms prize cantata,
entitled "Valerian." by Dr. N. J. Elsen
heimer of the Cincinnati College of Mu
sic. The words, by Dr. Gustav Bruehl,
run briefly:
â¢â¢Men are banished from the pleasures of
Paradise through their disobedience to
the Almighty. They are found grief
stricken on the shores of the stormy
ocean imploring the Maker of the Uni
verse for pardon. An angel descends
from heaven to console them. He calls
their attention to the beauties of nature,
that in itself is inspiring the man's am
bition and genius. His words are re
ceived with the greatest enthusiasm, and
his appeal to man's ambition is crowned
with success. For when he reappears
after a seor* of years, he finds the glo
rious work of human skill and invention.
The arts, with joyous pride, praise the
wonderful results of genius; poetry and
music especially are rejoicing over their
mighty influence. The divine messenger
expresses his joy. and hopes that all arts
have found a' home with the nations of
the world. Columbia, the representative
of the greatest nation of modern times,
amid the enthusiasm of her people,
offers her hand to Art. All people rejoice
and praise the mastering influence of the
art that has found a home with the most
illustrious nations of the world.'
At the close of the cantata Dr. Elsen
heimer makes a skillful and highly ef
fective use of the "Star-spangled Ban
ner." ,
FUNERAL RITES OVER
ENSIGN MONAGHAN
Portland Does Honor to the Memory
of the Victim of Samoan
Treachery.
PORTLAND, Or., June 25. â The re
mains of Ensign Robert Monaghan of
the cruiser Philadelphia, who was killed
in the fighting in Samoa, were given
every honor while in Portland, where
he was well remembered by many old
classmates. After lying at the armory
over night, the casket was earned out at
noon to the waiting hearse and taken
to the Cathedral.
First came a platoon of police, then
the naval and military escort under
Captain W. T. Carrol, consisting of the
Naval Reserve Battalion, a detach
ment of the Twenty-fourth Infantry
from Vancouver Barracks and the
guard of honorâ eleven men from Com
pany C, Second Regiment, of Spokane,
under Captain Green, and the Young
Men's Institute.
The First Regiment Band rendered
music and the bells tolled as the pro
cession passed up Washingtn street and
approached the Catholic Cathedral, in
which edifice 2000 people had assembled.
As the casket was borne up the main
aisle a dirge came from the organ,
and the choir rendered a hymn. The
singing of "Nearer, My God, to Thee"
was very touching-.
The service for the dead was con
ducted by the resident clergy, and
Archbishop Alexander Christie deliv
ered an address. The remains were
then escorted to the train, whfch left
for Spokane at 2:10 p. m.

King, the watchman, is missing.
FUTILE SEARCH
FOR BURIED GOLD
Cocos Island Treasure
Not Found.
STOCKTON, June 25.â Captain Geis
sler, the treasure hunter who has spent
seven years on Cocos Island and who
is back in Stockton with no gold, has
his faith in the story of buried millions !
unaltered. Geissler is the man, who, ,
seven years ago, sailed from here in the I
rickity little boat known as the Hay- i
seed, and succeeded with his small band j
of adventurous spirits in reaching the j
little Island off the Costa Rican coast, j
The story of the millions buried on the 'â¢
island by pirates under Del Pedro Ben
ito, in the year of 1821, was founded on
a report generally accepted as being
true, but the value of the interred Span,
ish coin has grown with the passing
years from {10,000,000 to $60,000,000. So
generally believed is the story that the
Central American Government has re
served certain rights in case the treas
ure is discovered, and more than one
passing warship has allowed a crew to
land in order to take a look at the is
land. Many stories have been related
concerning the island, but Geissler gives
the reasons for the faith within him
upon the following grounds:
During the early years of the present
century Cocos Island was the home of
a piratical band, composed mostly c-f
Portuguese. After their raids upon
helpless coast settlements Benito's band
would run for the island, and after car
ing for their booty would again put to
sea. Finally on one of the voyages the
pirate ship went against a stronger
vessel and but two of the cut-throats
were spared. These two men were al
lowed to live in order that they might
direct their captors to the place where
the doubloons were buried. They es
caped, and one of them is believed to
have been John Keating, who settled in
St. Johns, Newfoundland, a few years
later. At any rate Keating seemed to
talk a whole lot about the affair and to
know where the treasure was buried on
the island. He claimed to have secured
this information from one of the two
men who escaped.
Keating interested some seafaring
men in a scheme to recover the gold
and a vessel was fitted out in 1844 to
visit the island. The captain of the
vessel went ashore with Keating and
was never seen alive again. Keating
told a story of how he and the captain,
after securing all the treasure they
could carry, concluded to not return to
the waiting vessel, but to make their
way to the Costa Rican coast in the
canoe and thus escape the obligation of
dividing with the crew, or giving out
information as to what they had seen
Later they were to return to the island
and bring away the money. The Costa
Rican Government, however, suspected
him of having murdered the captain.
The story he told that their canoe had
overturned and the captain drowned
was a little too thin. Keating brought
away $10,000 and with this bribed some
officials and managed to get out of the
country. This occurred, according to
the story, in 1546.
Keating returned to Canada and died
there, leaving a widow, who is now a
Mrs. Brennan and resides at an ad
vanced age in British Columbia She
| says that when about to die Keating
disclosed to her the markings on the
island necessary to a successful hunt
for the treasure. She dreaded a sea
voyage and entered into an agreement
by which Geissler undertook to search
seven years ago.
A year ago the old lady, being dis
satisfleld with Geissler's reports, char
tered a vessel and went to the island.
Time has effaced many landmarks and
! to this is the unsuccessful search attri
! buted. A man named Hartford made
! the acquaintance of Mrs. Brennan dur
| ing her voyage and on learning her
story he interested British naval men.
The Imperieuse, under Commodore Pal
liser, landed a party last year, which
made a search against the protests of
the first comers. The sailors found
nothing.
Geissler says that all that remains to
be done is to prosecute a systematic
search. This may take years. He has a
large plantation laid out, with 20,000
coffee and 2000 banana trees already be
ginning to bear. Mrs. Geissler has be
come a resident of the island and the
two will spend their remaining years
looking after the plantation and search
ing for the buried millions of Del Pedro
Benito.
Cocos Island lies twenty miles off. the
coast and contains about twenty square
miles. Captain Geissler will return to
his island home in a few weeks.
DANGER OF A CLASH
ON ALASKAN BORDER
State Department Notified of the Bit
terness Between Americans and
Canadians.
WASHINGTON, June 25.â A Wash
ington special to the Journal says:
State Department officials are advised
there is eminent danger of a clash be
tween citizens of the United States and
Canada in disputed territory.
The department officials assert that
any clash near the line will be entirely
due to the impossibility of making
laws for a modus Vivendi while the
provisional line is held in abeyance.
Were the provisional line agreed to the
United States and Great Britain â¢
immediately formulate police and
toms regulation- which would guaran
tee protection for Americans on the
Canadian side and Canadians on the
American. The extreme tension of th?
situation is reported to the depart
ment to-day.

Slayer of Alfred Cook Suc
cumbs to the Effects of
an Operation.
SUISUN, June 25.â Jesse Walters 1
trial for the murder of Alfred Cook will
never take place. The accused man
succumbed to an operation performed
on him to-dny. His left leg was am
putated at 11 o'clock this morning, and
Just four hours later he breathed his
last. Dr. W. G. Downing of Suisun per
formed the operation, and was assisted
by E. L. Hennesy of Xapa. Walters re
gained consciousness a half-hour after
the surgeons had finished and was able
to answer some questions. He easily
recognized those about him. Mrs. Wal
ters ajid two sons were at the bedside
â¢ â when tlie end came.
Although h<> rested ensily last even
ing and felt confident then that the op,
oration would save his life, Walters
realized early this morning That the
end was near, and had his attorney
make out dee, is by which all his prop
erty was conveyed to his wife. He was
the possessor of some notes, and these
were transferred in a like manner. The
two sons of the deceased have already
been provided for. They will become
heirs to a life estate of valuable prop
erty held by thÂ»ir father. The real es
tate and notes which go t>> Mrs. Wal
ters are valued at about $10,000. The
remains will be si ;;t to Oakville, Napa

OVER SIX SCORE
YEARS OF LIFE
Indian Woman Dies at
a Great Age.
Special Disi>atch to The Call.
SALINAS. June 25.â The old Indian
woman known as Gregoria and supposed
to be the oldest Indian in this part of the
State Is dead, after having lived more j
than six score years. The exact age of
the old woman is not known, and even
phe was not aware what age she had at
tained. When asked she would become
quite angered and would reply that she
did not know, neither did she care, philo
sophically explaining that if phe did know
she would worry' and would die sooner.
Some of the oldest inhabitants claim
that Gregoria was nearly 150 years of
age. From the records kept by the Cath
olic priests and from other data it is
learned that the woman was at least r,L'
years old. Some time ago, when the old
mission of San Antonio was a spot at
which hundreds of people congregated to j
celebrate a certain anniversary, old
Gregoria wan present The celebration s-o
f nthused her that she divulged a secret |
which substantiated the recordsâ that she
was four years old when the mission w.i^
was an illiterate being, but
â¢was a devout Romanist. During her lons
affiliation with the Catholic church sho
never lost the tribal belief In the happy
hunting grounds" tradition, although In
every other respect she was entirely
Christianized.
Gregoria to no one living now has
told h*r life's history, but it is known it
was filled with true Indian romance and
adventure. She was horn near San An- j
tonlo, and although she lived such a long j
find eventful life was away from the place
of her birth but twiceâ once to Mission
Fan Miguel and on another occasion to
the Mission Soledad. Gregoria never was
known to wear a shoe or even a mocoa-

WOULD NOT RIDE
WITH NON-UNION CREWS'
Passengers Leave Cars in Cleveland.
Lines All Running and No More
Trouble Expected.
CLEVELAND, June 25.â 0n1y one out
l.ri-ak (if violence attended the resumption
of traffic on all the lin.-s of the big Con
solidated Street Hallway this morning.
There wai an objection in some parts of
the city to the retention of the non-union
men who were kept by the company. A
;>;irty of twonty-fivr men assembled near
the Brooklyn bridge, just south of the
city, and whenever a car came along with
,-i non-union crew the passengers were
asked to disembark nnd wait for another
manned by ;i union crew. In most cases
the passengers <liil us requested. Finally
a non-union conductor undertook to argue
with the crowd, :in<l he was promptly
struck on the head with a Hub and he
and the motorman driven away. The mob
refused to permit the car to move until a
union crew came along, and pushed it to
-The barns.
As a rule the old men were glad the
Ftrike was settled, though there was some
grumbling because the non-union men
were kept. It is predicted that all the
non-union men will be glad to leave the
city within thirty days, though the com
pany imposed aB one of the conditions of
the agreement for the settlement of the
trouble that all the new men should be
treated with consideration by the old em
ployes. I

employe had been unduly intimate with |
Mrs. Walters.
Early in December Walters became sus- |
picious that his wife and Cook were in
communication with one another, and
were even meeting clandestinely in San ,
Francisco. Acting on this idea, and en
listing the services of George S. McKen
zie, then and for ten years past Sheriff
of Napa County, a private but persistent j
Investigation was commenced to locate |
Cook and ascertain if the ex-barkeeper |
and Mrs. Walters maintained closer rela- ;
tions than the law permitted. In this al
leged conspiracy of private revenge, the
prosecution claimed, McKenzle, the high
est peace officer in the county, used the
prestige and power of his public office.
He sought to obtain prohibited Informa
tion from the local postal authorities, but
without success, and also endeavored to
secure the aid of the San Francisco Po
lice Department in the search for Cook.
Having at last located Cook, the in
tended victim of a husband's vengeance
was Induced by a letter from Mrs. Walt
ers to seek and obtain employment In
the stable of McKehr.ie.
Whether Mr?. Walters was conscious or
unconscious of the conspiracy the mi
thori'.iÂ»'s were not prepared to say; but
they were strongly inclined to the belief
that she was either deceived or coerced
into asking McKenzic to give employ
ment to Cook, who. she claimed, was her
cousin. ami informing Cook that a place
was open for him at McKenzie's.
It was alleged by the prosecution that
it was prearanged between Walters and
McKenzie to have Cook in the box stall
where he would be done to death on the
pretext that Walters was forced to kill
him in self-defense. The plan was carried
out. but Cook, after Walters had opened
fire upon him. succeeded in drawing a re
volver and Inflicting the wound that to
day resulted in the prisoner's death.
McKenzie was afterward released on
bonds, but Walters was held in the Coun
ty Jail at Fairfield to await trial. From
the time his captivity commenced, it
seemed unlikely that he would ever live
to answer for the killing of the man who
eked his home. The wound In his leg
kept growing worse, and finally the pris
oner's physicians decided that the only
hope for him lay in the amputation of the
limb.
To the last Walters maintained that he
killed Cook in self-defense. Yesterday,
fearing that the operation would end In
his death, he made a deposition, in which
he swore that on the day of the killing
he went into the livery stable, in which
the tragedy took place. ami had no Inten
tion of meeting Cook. As soon as the
two men met Cook fired upon him. the
bullet taking effect in the left leg. Wal
ters reutrned the fire. Walters exonerated
ex-Sheriff McKezie. declaring that Mc-
Kenzie had nothing to do with the killing.
THE SEA SERPENT
IS IN ON TIME
A Monster Seen Off the
Coast of Muscongus.
SpÂ«^-lal Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON, June 25.â A special from Mus
congus, Maine, says that the gTeat "pogy"
industry in the entire New England
coaost has been stopped by a giant sea
Berpent, which carries away the schools
of menhaden.
For several weeks the four "scout"
steamers of the pogy fleet â the Wal
ter Adams, Captain Bert Macomber; the
A. M. Hathaway, Captain Dan Mason;
the Alaska, Captain Martin Leman, and
the L. Brightman, Captain Sam Murray
have been hunting the whole length of the
New England coast Tor the menhaden,
but in vain. They have not been -able to
find a single pogy.
They did find the cause of this state of
things, however. They found the little
Canadian fishing smack Elizabeth M. and
her skipper. Zeke Tarbottom, and all of
his crew stated with the greatest insist
ence that they actually saw the serpent in
broad daylight and at short range.
There, was not a drop of liquor on
board.
As near as they could estimate the
monster was more than ten fathoms long
and its body was about as big around as a
keg of nails. Its tail was tapering and the
captain said every once in a. while it would
lash the water into foam for twenty
feet around. He said the head was queer
looking. It was not like a snake's head
and as near as they could make out it
looked more like a horse than anything
else.
Its body was looped up here and there
he said, like the corkline of a seine, and
it kept Its head moving most of the time.
Sometimes It would stick its head up into
the air four or five feet and look round
and then it would souse it under and wig
gle along for a few yards. It moved very
easy like, lie said, and some of the young
fellows In the crew was all on fin; to row
out in the dingy and see what it was
like, but he would not let them.
CHARGES EMBEZZLEMENT
AGAINST H+S BROTHER
Wealthy Stock - Raiser of Fresno
County Files a Sensational
Complaint.
FRESNO, June 25.â 1n a complaint filed
early this morning in Justice St. John's
court Pille Iriberry, a wealthy stock
raiser, charged his brother, Pedro Iri
berry, with embezzlement. The com
plaint was filed after consultation with
the District Attorney and a warrant was
immediately Issued for Pedro Iriberry's
arrest. This afternoon Constable Pules
ton served the warrant and placed the
prisoner in jail.
The amount which Iriberry is accused
of having embezzled from his brother
was $1275. The complaint sets forth tnat
a check for that amount was entrusted to
Pedro Iriberry last April by his brother
for safe keeping. It is charged the de
fendant. Instead of holding the check In
trust, had it cashed and appropriated the
money to his own use. Only a few days
ago Pille Iriberry learned of this. He
then demanded that the money be return
ed, and up to the time of his arrest Pedro
endeavored to raise the amount.
The brothers are well known throughout
the county. Pille Iriberry is the owner of
several large bands of sheep and controls
hundreds of acres of valuable real eatate

DEMOCRATS STILL
HANG IN THE AIR
; No Agreement at Louis
ville Convention.
â â¦ â
GOEBEL'S STRONG HAND
BUT ONE SLIGHT BKEAK IN THE
STONE-GOEBEL COMBINE.
The Excitement Is Intense and the
Chances Are a Dark Horss
Will Win Out in
the End.
Fnerial Dispatch to The Tall.
LOUISVILLE, June 25.â 1"n to a late
hour to-night there is no sign of an agree
ment betwe* " any two of the Democratic
candidates for Governor, and it seems
likely that the tirsi ballot taken when
. the convention meets to-morrow morn
| ing will result just about as did th 3
eleventh Saturday night. Candidates and
ihoir managers have been on the so all
day out of one conference into another,
1 but so far to no purpose. The 1092 dele
gates In the convention are divided so
evenly that there is not a difference of
thirty votes in the strength of the mree
I candidates, Stone. Gobel and Hardin. Out
of these <socUl is the strongest because
of the soli-Ut y of his support. He controls
liis following absolutely and can vote
them for himself or throw them to cither
'. of his opponents at will. Neither Stone
nor Hardin can do this, and for that rea
â  son neither Is in a position to make ad
\ antageous terms.
There bus been a break in the Stone-
Goebel combination since balloting be
i gan. caused primarily by the action of
Goebel's managers in voting the seventy
votes of Louisville solidly for the Kenton
County leader on the first ballot. The-
Stone people say their understanding was
that the rqte was to be divided equally
between Stone and Coebel, but the lat- j
ter. it is said, produced a written agree
; ment covering the combination of the two
Forces up to a temporary organization,
but containing no mention of the Louis
ville delegation. Chagrined as the Stone
people an 1 at the fair.rre of the comDin.i
tion promptly to effect the nomination cf j
their candidate, it is believed they can in
a spirit of revenge bring about the nuni- !
ination of Hardin.
They threatened to try this when Goe:>el !
showed such surprising strength on the
; lirst ballot, and went so far as to start
a stampede, but Â©oebel's nerve and cool
ness checkmated it. On the other hand, !
! the Hardin people cannot throw their !
str. ngth solidly to Stone, for they are di
vided in the matter of a second choice,!
and, as was the case yesterday, many ;
would go to Goebel in case of a break.
A noteworthy feature of the contest is
the Hardin campaign. Coming Into the
convention with a hundred votes short of
a majority of the delegates, beaten at
every point in the temporary organiza- '
tion and weakened by adverse decisions.
the credentials committee involving
Bcores of seats, the Hardin managers.
with consummate cleverness, jumped Into
the fi^ht when the game seemed iost, |
withdrew the name of General Hnrdin .
'. and left Goebel and Stone to fight it our. I
1 These two fell into the trap and flew at
i each other's throat, with the result that
-when the convention adjourned last
night Goebel and Stone had split and Flar
; din on the last ballot stood" In recorded
votes.
Meanwhile the throf-oornered fi.cht
prows warmer, and the delegates, who
have spent nearly a week trying to nom
inate a State ticket, may yet have to look
outside the trio now occupying the rinp
to find a leader upon whom they can
unite.
DUNHAM'S BONES NOT
ON MOUNT HAMILTON
Murderer Appeared at a Farmhouse
Days After His Crime Was
Committed.
SALINAS. June 26.â The clnfm repeat- ]
! edly made that James C. Dunham, the j
Campbells murderer, had perished In the |
Mount Hamilton hills, is Bcouted by Mrs.
Jennie Bushnell, a well-known resident
!of the Paralso Springs country- Mrs.
Bushnell recently spent a few days In
! Salinas and made the following facts
known: She was personally acquainted
I with Dunham. Three or four days after
] the commission of his crime he appeared
at her mountain home, said that he was
! out on a hunting expedition and asked for
| and was given a meal and a supply of
I food.
The Bushnells live in the most isolated
portion of Monterey County and in a
sparsely settled section of- the Santa Lu
cia hills. They receive their mail at ir
! regular, intervals. It was due to this fact
that Dunham was not reported to the
authorities, as the papers containing ac
i counts of the murder of the McGlincy
family had not at that time reached the
! Bushnell homeâ in fact was not received
i until many weeks afterward.
After remaining with the Bushnells dur
ing the greater portion of the day Dun
ham left, headed for the south.
A number of years ago Dunham lived in
i that section of Monterey County and was
thoroughly- familiar with the topography
lof that portion of the county's most
i rugged mountain range.

WATSON C. GREEN'S
DEATH IS MOURNED
LODI, Juno 2."). â This community was greatly shocked to learn of the un
timely death nf Attorney Watson C. Green, which occurred at the Ger
man Hospital in San Francisco late last night. Mr. Green -ad pone
there for treatment a few days before, and on Thursday submitted to
an operation in hope of prolonging his life. From the beginning the - hysi
cians in charge offered little or no encouragement, although the operation
was successfully performed and a large tumor removed from the intestines.
His wife and child were with him at the end.
Mr. Green was one of the best known men in San Joaquin County, an
upright citizen, a promoter <>f good for his home town and an attorney of
high standing. He was always foremost in all enterprises which might
help his community, and was a good friend to many a poor man who hap
pened to become legally entangled.
The deceased was a son of Rev. Jesse Green, a pioneer minister of this
State and one of the very first settlers in this vicinity when it was only a
tangled thicket. â¢ He graduated from the State University and at once be
gan a legal career, commencing with the early days of Lodi. He was very
successful and built up a large practice.
Mr. Green was always prominent in politics, being at the time of his
death a member of the Republican State Central Committee. He once ran
for the Assembly, but was defeated. He was editor of the Lodi Sentinel and
connected with the Review Publishing Company of this place. He leaves a
beautiful home in Lodi, besides considerable other valuable property near
here.
The interment will take place to-morrow under the auspices of the Odd
Fellows and Knights of Pythias of which orders he was a. member. He was
47 years of a and a native of Arkansas.
MYSTERY OF MISS
SLAVIN'S DEATH
Now Believed That She
Was Murdered.
Special I>ispntch to Thp Tall.
WICHITA. Kan., June 25.â When the
body of Miss Belle Slavin was found :.t
2 o'clock last Thursday morning in the
office of the National Hank of Commerce,
death having resulted from a bullet
wound in the head, it was supposed that
she had committed suicide. Later devel
opments seem to indicate that the young
woman was muni-red. Coroner Mc
laughlin now says her death was not
suicidal, and the police are working on
the theory that murder has br-en done.
Miss Slavin, who was the bank's stenog
rapher, was permitted to take in outside
work and was frequently employed un
commercial travelers and other strangers,
the work of tUts kind often keening her
In the office of the bank until 10 at night
Mr Jones, president of the bank, now
states thai on Wednesday afternoon ;i
strange man came to the bank and asked
to have some work done. Miss Slavin
told him to bring it around after 6 o clock.
Mr Jones says that he observed the
stranger surveying the interior or ihe
bank very critically. While waiting for
the stranger to keep his appointment MJSd
Slavin evidently busied herself by writ
ing letters to friends, for when her body
was found three sealed Letter* were found,
one addressed to a young woman in Kan
sas City, one to S. P. I^>w. Portland. Or.,
and one to Austin Akin of Boutn Haven.
All these letters were written In a pleas
ant vein and there was r.othing to indi
cate self-destruction.
A barber who passed the bank at 3
o'clock saw Miss Slavin standing before
the window, apparently waiting for some
one Another citizen heard a pistol shot
just after 8 o'clock. When Miss Slavln'rf
father, the president of the bank and an
other citizen went to the bank in search
of her at 2 o'clock In the morning they
found the bank door unlocked, papers
were scattered around the floor, the con
tents of several drawers were disarranged
and Miss Slavin's keys were missing. The
revolver found by the young woman's
side was not her "own. Her own weapon
was found in a drawer. The theory of tho
police is that the murderer expected to
secure valuables or money from the bank.
EDITOR BIRD CLUBBED
BY TWO MEXICANS
Lively Affrays at Nogales Followed
Articles Concerning Customs
Officials.
NOGAI.ES. Ariz.. June 25.â An assault
was made this morning upon Colonel Al
len T. Bird, editor of the Oasis, and the
doughty editor was severely beaten with
a club wielded by two men. The tight
grew out of the publication of vnrious
articles concerning alleged corruption in
the Collector of Customs' office at No
gales, Ariz. The assault was made by
two Mexicans by the name of Ullman.
They are both considered "bandidos," or
bandits, and Colonel Bird would undoubt
edly have been killed had not citizens
rushed to his assistance.
A warrant was sworn out by District
Attorney Harlow and placed in the hands
of a deputy sheriff from Crtttenden, as
it was alleged that the warrant would
not be served by the Sheriff or his depu
ties in this town. The Crittenden deputy
authorized W. J. N. McCurdy, an attor
ney, to assist him in making the arrest,
and turned one of the prisoners over to
McCurdy. The prisoner desired to go to
his room to procure some articles before
going to jail. Attorney McCurdy allowed
him to do so, but immediately upon ar
riving at the room the prisoner seized a
revolver and declared that he would not
go to jail. McCurdy thereupon drew his
revolver and shouted "Hands up!" The
prisoner dropped his pistol, and Collector
Chenoweth, who had been following, im
mediately rushed in and attempted to
grab the attorney, who was acting as a
"posse comitatus," but Chenoweth was
also stood off by McCurdy, and the pris
oner was taken before a magistrate.
Both prisoners were bound over to ap
pear under $1000 bonds. Collector Cheno
weth. who it Is alleged had hired these
two men to assault liinl, went upon their
bonds.
BARELY SAVED FROM
BLEEDING TO DEATH
Frank Powers the Victim of a Myste
rious Cutting Affray at
Stockton.
STOCKTON'. June 25.â At an early hour
this morning the police found a man ly
ing at the comer of Main and El Dorado,
streets bleeding to death from an ugly
wound in the neck. He was identified
as Frank Powers, a guest of the Occi
dental Hotel. The man was located by
a trail of blood which the police followed
around three blocks before finding him.
An air of mystery surrounds the affair.
It is believed the cutting took place near â¢
the hotel, as it was there the bloody
trail began. The man must have dropped
exhausted from loss of blood. He was
taken to the Receiving Hospital and the
wound sewed up just in time to save his
life. The jugular veto was missed by
only a fraction ef an inch. All the man
would say was "Gibson did it." and then
he would refuse to say anything more or
tell what the trouble arose over.
The police arrested William Gibson, a
man who works with Powers in the ship
yard, tut he claims he can prove an alibi.
Nothing was found on him connecting
him with the affair, and he was in bed
when the police arrived. They hurried
him to the hospital to get Power's to make
an Identification, as it. was thought the
injured man might expire. Powers posi
tively identified him as the man who did
the cutting, but refused to say what
trouble, if any. caused it. The "infured
man probably will recover. The police
are making an effort to unravel the mys
tery.

STILL AT HIGH-WATER MARK
AGAIN Europe needs our gold, and again we
have got it tor her. Last week $4,000,000 was
withdrawn for export at New York, and it is
said to be for loaning purposes. Exchange and trade
balances indicate this, as tfie United States is not
obliged to export gold at the moment to satisfy com
mercial obligations abroad. So the financiers natur
ally infer that the outflow is in the shape of borrowed
money, especially as political conditions in Europe
just now are such that ready money is needed. Wall
street operators, however, seem to take the opposite
View and to consider it merely the forerunner of larger
gold experts from now on. Their ground is that with
diminishing exports of merchandise, as compared
with imports, the balance of trade is gradually shaping
against this country, which, of course, means ship- i
ments of gold to Europe sooner or later. There
seems to be no basis for the supposition that large re
turns of American securities by Europe are causing
gold export, for the quantity of returned securi
t'cs during the past three or four months has been
small and growing smaller. Again, the New York
money market is <\u'\ct and easy, while the London
and Berlin markets are strong, with a demand for
funds. So the commercial theorists seem to have the
best of the argument.
The trade balance shows 19 per cent less exports
than last year and 26 per cent larger imports, but an
increasing excess of exports is promised for June.
The Government revenues are less than $100,000,000
behind the expenditures for the fiscal year, notwith
standing the large payments for the Philippines,
Cuban soldiers and the greatly increased army and
navy expenses. This showing is considered satisfac
tory. The commerce of the country continues to lead
1898. the bank clearings for the past week being 40.2!
per cent larger than during the same week last year,
and out of twenty large cities only one â Omaha â
shows a loss, and that only 4.7 per cent. The failures
for the week amounted to 178, against 285 for the
same week in 1898. As long as the clearings and fail
ures keep up this fine exhibit the country is all right.
The leading staples are in better position as a rule
than they have been. Iron, of course, is active and
Stiff â that goes without saying. In fact, the usual
summer shut-down in the iron and allied trades will
be ignored this year. Prices for Everything in the way j
of iron have advanced this year, and apparently the
end is not yet. The iron trade never saw such times :
before. The woolen industry is also reported active, j
the manufactured product being in brisk request at ;
all leading centers, while the call for wool has been so i
sharp that supplies are being materially reduced and !
prices are rising all along the line. San Francisco j
dealers calculate that at the present rate of demand
the local market will be cleaned up of wool by the Ist !
of August. Cotton has declined somewhat, owing to
improved crop prospects, though the general market |
if reported in a strong position. Wheat has continued
unsettled, the bad outlook in Southeastern Europe
and a fine foreign demand being offset by ample
American supplies and improved prospects for spring
wheat. Raw sugar is weaker under reports of im
proving prospects, but refined is in heavy domestic i
demand and firm.
Here in California there have been no important j
changes in trade conditions during the past week.
1 he export trade of the coast is fine and freight rates
by sea have ruled firm of late in consequence. Farm i
products have been in quick demand as a rule, owing ;
to Government orders and the call for the northern j
coast of Alaska, which is reported remarkably lively !
this year. This latter demand for fruit and'other farm I
produce has been a godsend to the California farmer
this summer. The canners continue to scour the
country for fruit, and quotations are still higher, while i
the East is taking all the fruit we can send there. This !
is the finest fruit year California has seen for a long j
time.
General merchandise is active and the merchants in j
&]] lines report a brisk movement. The general ten
dency in prices is upward, which explains the in- i
creased cost of living noticed by all housekeepers, i
Harvest wages have advanced from 50 to 100 per cent \
over last year, and there is a demand for men all over |
the State. This improvement in labor conditions is
having its beneficial effect on trade, which was rarely I
better than it is to-day. |
THE CORKSCREW LINE.
THE CALL from the beginning of the contro
versy with the. Market-street Railway Com
pany has endeavored to find and to support a
method of supplying increased railway facilities to
the property owners and the business men in the
northeastern quarter of San Francisco. Much of the
Market-street monopoly scheme has been necessarily
abandoned because the votes essential to its original
adoption could not be obtained. But one part of the
scheme is now being pressed under cover of the rea
sonable and just corkscreWkCxtension, which* is an
unnecessary abandonment of public rights and inter
ests, and open to every objection that has been gen
erally approved.
It was insisted by The Call, which merely expressed
sound public opinion in an intelligible way, that un
less indispensable no new franchise whatever should
be granted to the Market-street consolidation until the
new charter became operative. The plan was to spread
a network of new franchises and privileges over the
north end of San Francisco that would destroy all
possible competition and enable the Market-street
Railway Company to hold the streets in a vise. This
was manifestly unnecessary for the sole purpose to
which the present application has been restricted.
With the trolley reluctantly tolerated upon the Post
street system and its connections, with the new fran
chise for a single block on Taylor street, and, as was
ultimately concluded, the projecting of the Sansome
street track northward to the bay, complete and rapid
communication between the northeast and the south
west quarters of the city, with all necessary accom
panying and connecting facilities, would be estab
lished. When, however, under cover of disused fran
chises on Geary street, it was intended to employ the
trolley on that street from Taylor street to Grant
avenue, a new franchise was proposed on Grant ave
nue from Geary to Bush street, and thence down
Bu^h street to Sansome street, that was certainly un
necessary for legitimate accommodation and would
have had the effect of riveting the Market-street mo
nopoly on a most important and growing business
portion of San Francisco.
It is now designed, and we regret to say with the
apparent approbation of Mayor Phelan, who. on this
as on the gas question, has abandoned his originally
upright position, simply to drop one block of this
extensive and valuable franchise and place the point
cf its commencement at Post street instead of Geary
street. Thus, on the street-railway question as on
the gas question, compromise, as understood by Mr.
Phelan, is a practical surrender of public rights and in
terests in important particulars. A new franchise from
Post to Bush street, on Grant avenue and thence down
Bush street to Sansome street, is a very important
withdrawal of the little franchise capital there is left
to the municipality and a positive and unnecessary
donation to the Market-street Railway Company, the
effect and intention of which are to make that monop
oly virtually invulnerable.
Whatever inducement may have been insidiously
offered, however weakly Mr. Phelan may recede from
positions that in the first instance were probably un
necessarily vigorous. The Call does not propose to
abandon the protection of the public interests, nor,
under the specious pretext of meeting a righteous
demand, to consent to a steal that is as bad in prin
ciple, though less in extent, than the robbery first
projected.
The Call hopes that the Supervisors may stand by
their colors.
THE BOURBON DEMOCRACY.
"T^HE. platform adopted by the heterogeneous
Democracy of Kentucky reads like a catalogue
of relics unearthed from the age of stone. Its
inspissated Bourbonism is its only- characteristic fea
ture. It reaffirms the Chicago platform of 1896
"without the slightest qualification." This alone would
be an evidence of retrogressive stability that no phys
ical, moral or intellectual convulsion could shake.
But its subsequent resurrections and its unconsciously
ludicrous efforts to infuse the breath of life into the
decayed skeletons of dead issues exceed all possible
anticipation. Its language reads like oracular petri
f cation and is colder and more incapable of mastica
tion than of the embalmed speeches of W. J. Bryan.
"Our faith in bimetallism is vindicated by events."
The vindication consists of the fact that every leading
nation in the world has refused to co-operate with the
United States in overturning the Baconian system of
logic by the establishment of a double monetary
standard. Therefore, we are instructed by the inspired
Bourbonists of a State where all whisky is good but
some better than others, that '''relief can only come by
the independent action of the United States," which
means the instantaneous adoption of a silver stand
ard and the scaling of all wages and of all debts by the
exact difference between the bullion value of silver
and the Chicago platform ratio of 16 to 1.
After a long imaginary interval in the celebrated
impersonation by the actor, Jefferson, everybody is
astonished to find that Rip Van Winkle has come to
life, while the bones of his ancient dog have been
actually pelted into fragments by the torrents of years.
The Kentucky Democracy has accomplished a greater
feat of resuscitation in its free silver plank, which
even their immutable leader has only casually re
ferred to of late in tones of blended reverence and
stoicism.
Bat Kntucky voices many other political entangle
ments. It measurably justifies the war with Spain
but damns the expense and charges it to the admin
istration. It has also discovered some mysterious
connection between trusts, against the worst forms of
which the Republican party has not only declared
but legislated, and the demonetization of silver, which
was supposed to have been abandoned as a party
slogan long before the unprocreative fusions of 1896
and 1898. It has poured trusts, protection and cheap
silver into a witch's caldron and concocted a mixture
for which no descriptive name will ever be invented
; and which would turn the stomach of the last sur
vivor of the dreg-swallowers of Bascom's grocery.
The indorsement of William J. Bryan for the Presi
dency necessarily follows. The premises and the con
j elusion are as closely related as the apostolic exposure
of the two domesticated quadrupeds that so promptly
j returned â the one to its vomit and the other to its
1 wallowing in the mire.
The Call accepts the blast from Kentucky with com
; plete equanimity and only regrets that the indorse
| rnent of the repudiated fusionists of 1896 was not in
I some manner fastened upon our State and muncipal
I fusionists of 1898. That, however, will come in due
I time. Republicans can possess their souls in patience
I and they will soon hear the fusion disharmonies, ac
companie4 by the railroad whistle.
SCANDALOUS APPOINTMENTS.
WHETHER the charges against the newly
elected principal of the San Jose Normal
School be true or false, another scandal has
gathered around the appointments of Governor Gage,
for of course the Governor is responsible for the
action taken by the Trustees appointed by him to
manage the affairs of the school, evidently not in the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JUNE 26, 1899.
interests of the institution, but. for political purposes.
From the day when he entered upon his office and
threw aside the mask he had worn during the cam
paign before the people, Gage has been not only an
open but a shameless supporter of the worst prac
tices of politics. Almost every appointment he has
j made has been either a scandal in itself or the cause of
one. When he has not appointed embezzlers to posi
i tions of public trust he has appointed persons hardly
i more worthy. His one object appears to be to advance
the Burns push and the railroad gang.
The appointments by which the welfare of so im- ]
portant an institution as the State Normal School at
San Jose has been subordinated to machine politics
constitute one of the grossest outrages upon our edu
cational system that could be possibly perpetrated. !
â¢ That it has resulted in an immediate scandal is per- j
I haps not altogether to be deplored, since the charges
made against the new principal serve to direct public
attention to the manner in which the Gage Trustees
have entered upon their work of using the school for
i political purposes.
From what the Governor has done with regard to ;
the Normal School, it is evident that no institution i
of the State is considered by him to be an unfit place
for the display of his political favoritism and his devo- \
tion to the Burns machine. It is fortunate, therefore, \
that comparatively few vacancies have occurred in I
I the Board of Regents of the State University for him
;to fill. He would have used the university as he has ;
j used the San Jose Normal School. The new presi- j
dent of the institution would have been the choice of I
Burns politicians and his selection a new scandal to j
blacken the reputation of the State and seriously |
injure the university itself.
Gage has taken care of his friends. All the member';
of his Los Angeles law office, from his partner to the
janitor, have been provided with "soft snaps" and
I good salaries at the expense of the taxpayers. He has
i taken care of the Burns push and of the railroad. To
; their demands he has sacrificed everything. Not only
| the offices which have been long regarded as the
i spoils of politics have been placed at the disposal of
I the machine, but, as is now seen, the great educa
tional institutions of the State have also been sub
! initted to it as a part of the plunder.
It has been the desire of the people of California
that the public educational system from the primary
schools to the university should be kept free from
the manipulation of machine politicians. Gage has
wantonly and defiantly affronted that sentiment. The
scandalous jobbery that well nigh wrecked the San
Jose High School has hardly passed from the public
mind, and now Gage turns over to the same gang that
made that high school a part of the spoils of politics
the control of the State Normal School. There is no
telling to what extent Gage may yet go in his sub
} servience to Burns, the railroad and the political ma
chine which they manage; and it is therefore by no
means to be regretted that an open scandal has oc
curred to call public attention to his unscrupulous and
shameless course.
PHELAN'S GAS RESOLUTION.
OXCE more the public has been given a striking
and costly proof of the frail support on which
Mayor Phelan has built up his pretensions to
be a careful and faithful guardian of public interests.
The resolution fixing gas rates at $i io per thousand
feet has been weighed in the courts and found to be
so carelessly drawn up as to be utterly worthless and
invalid.
In the suit of the San Francisco Gas and Electric
Company vs. William B. Hooper, in which the valid
ity of the ordinance was involved. Judge Seawell dis
missed the issue with something like contempt. Under
the act of March 4. 1878, the municipal authorities are
authorized and required to fix the standard quality
and illuminating power of the gas to be furnished,
and tlio rate and price for each 1000 cubic feet to be
charged therefor, "by any person, company or cor
poration." The Phelan resolution, introduced and
submitted to the Board of Supervisors by his counsel
and direction, regulated the quality and fixed the price
of gas to be furnished the city "by any company or
corporation." The word "person" included in the
statute was omitted from the ordinance, and there- !
fore the ordinance is not uniform in its operation, i
and is consequently invalid.
Upon this showing of a clear and plain breach of j
the law. the Judge did not deem it worth his while
to consider any other of the issues raised in the case, j
After pointing out the defect of the ordinance he j
said: "I make no further comment upon this de
parture from the plain requirements of the statute
than to suggest to the board the propriety in its future '
resolutions of following the letter as well as the spirit
of the statute."
A blunder of such a nature cannot be defended upon
any ground and can be explained only upon the sup- '
position that the Mayor "hefted" the statute instead of
reading it; and drew his conclusions of what it re- i
quired from the way it felt, rather than from what it '
said. This is the second notable instance where the ;
city has had to suffer because of the careless manner
in which the Mayor attends to his official duties.
From first to last the proceedings of Mayor Phelan j
with respect to the issue between the city and the
gas company have been a series of contradictions and
absurdities. Early in March the Gas and Electric
Company declared its willingness to accept a rate of
Si 50 as a fair price for gas, but the Mayor was then
posing as a reformer of the most radical school, so
he set himself against such an agreement and brought
about the introduction of the resolution fixing the rate
at $1 10. He then declared that ordinance to be valid
and was loud in urging the people to refuse to pay
higher rates. Later on he saw a new light from some
source, and a short time ago gave his sanction to
another resolution fixing the rate at $1 50, thus mak
ing a complete surrender to the company and expos
ing the weakness of his pretensions as a "defender of
the public welfare."
The issue now gees over for another year. The
gentlemen who made the fight in the courts to uphold i
the $1 10 ordinance have lost their money, but possi
bly they are wiser as well as sadder men, and have
profited something from the experience.
The British aristocracy is fairly drinking in Ameri
canism these days. At the fashionable Albert Doll
Bazaar in London an American bar was the star at
traction. The Duke of Manchester, Lord Henry
Somerset and other titled swells acted as bartenders
and mixed a thousand American cocktails for their
fair patrons.
Judge Redwine is said to be responsible for the wild
confusion and parliamentary demoralization which
have overcome the delegates to the Kentucky Demo
cratic Sate Convention. Perhaps if the gentlemen
had been true to their friend John Barleycorn they
would have retained their senses.
A peculiar and particularly pathetic form of insan
ity has manifested itself in a war veteran and pen
sioner of Wooster, Ohio. He has asked the Govern
ment to reduce his pension.
Friends of Rear Admiral Kautz are relieved by the
news from Washington that he will not be relieved.
THE MINING FIELD
AND THE EXPOSITION
The general prospects of the mining fea-
I ture of California's exhibit at the Paris
Exposition next year were described on
Saturday by B. XV. .Runyon, president of
the California commission, who recently
returned from a visit of Inquiry to the
East. It is now certain that the Ideas
concerning a large and striking display of
California's mineral resources and indus
try which have from the start filled
the minds of the enterprising mining men
concerned with the general welfare of the
industry, must be greatly circumscribed,
i Owing to the comparatively small amount
!of space obtainable the display must be
small and the efforts of those Interested
in Its success must be directed to making
|it varied, rich and attractive and to the
effective advertising of the California
mining field in connection with the dis
play.
Mr. Runyon learned that the whole Cal
ifornia exhibit cannot be bunched in one
I place. According to the will of the ex
| position authorities in Paris the United
States' exhibits must be shown, according
jto prescribed classification, in special
! buildings or departments devoted to this
i and that industry or interest. California's
â  display must be divided up accordingly
and occupy the space in each United
; States collection awarded by Commis
i sioner Peck and his department chiefs.
Mr. Peck appears to have appreciated the
importance of the mining industry in this
country, which produces nearly ?500,000,000
worth of mineral products yearly, and he
i has mn do special efforts to secure as large
I an amount of space for it as possible. The
United States exhibit will !"â  placed to
| frether in the big Mining building. Pre
liminary diagrams secured by Mr. Runyon
show that the United States has been
given an area of unstated dimensions,
Modern Gold-Dredger Recently
Started on Feather River.
This shows the outward appear
ance of one of the big $35,000 gold
dredgers of the modern New Zea
land type, now multiplying in
California. It is the one lately In
stalled by the Kia Ora Gold-Dredg
ing Company in a tract of orchard
and pasture, nearly three-quarters
of a mile from the Feather River
below Oroville. The surface is
about eleven feet above the water
level. It was set up in an excava
; nearly square, in one of the large central
i aisles of the Mining building- Japan at
one end and Portugal at the other have )
I each about one-tenth as much space. Cal- ;
1 ifornia will get whatever share of this ;
Bpace is awarded t<> it by P. J. N. Skiff of â â 
Chicago, who is in charge of the mining,
feature of the American exhibit. How
many square feet of floor area it will have ;
la not yet known. A portion of the whole
Bpace will be divided anrnnÃ States pro- |
: viding special exhibits, and as California
has made the largest State appropriation
and has the greatest mining record and j
greatest variety of mineral resources it
will douhtlesÃ get more room than any
other State. Then it may contribute a
good deal to the general make-up of the
American display.
"I saw Mr. Skiff at Chicago and got
â  some general ideas on the mining exhib-
I it," said Mr. Kunyon. "He said that j
among other things he wanted California ,
j to send petroleum, borax, asphaltum.
! onyx, rich cold ores and gems. There
| would be no room for showing actual mm- ;
Ing machinery in operation, but small i
working models might be shown. He at
once agreed to accept a working model
i of a California quartz mill, which will
be supplied with a ton or two of ore and
! show the actual operation in progress. !
The California exhibits will be delivered
at Chicago, where the responsibility will
be assumed by them. The running exhibit j
- must be small, but we want to make a
I striking showing. Pictures, topographical
i and other maps and descriptive literature |
| should be sent. Some could be displayed
â  and the rest constitute a supply for distrt
-1 bution. Mr. Skiff agreed that California !
'â  could send a special representative to at- j
i tend its mining display, answering ques- i
tions, etc., and that he would appoint
him an honorary mineralogist on. his own
staff. Each mineral specimen may bear
i the name of the individual contributor,
! the mine, etc. A special representative
of Mr. Skiff's department will be out here
soon and then more will be known."
On Saturday Mr. Runyon wrote Mr.
Skiff in part as follows:
"Since my return to California we have
; earnestly taken up the work of making j
i up the' different exhibits, in which we
I would like mining to be one of the prin
cipal features. I have the memorandum
you gave me regarding the different spec
imens we would like exhibited from Cali
fornia, and within a day of two will see
I one of our manufacturers in reference to
making a complete quartz mill, which we i
would like to exhibit in action. I am not ]
positive that we will be able to make this
exhibit, but will advise you in a few days.
We can, however, give you a very choice
exhibit of ores from our chief mines.
"Can you give me any definite informa
tion as to how much space we will have
in your department? When the amount is
allotted to us we can work much more
intelligently, as you know."
The exposition appropriation bill as
agreed to in legislative committee pro
vided $120,000, and of this the committee
estimated $15,000 for the mining industry.
A strong committee of- the California
Miners.' Association went to Sacramento
and succeeded in raising the appropria
tion to $130,000, with the tacit understand
i ing with the legislators and the Gover
! noi that the raise was for the miners, and
; that $35,000 should be devoted to adver
i tising this great and booming California
I industry. The disposition of the fund is
largely left with the Commissioners alone.
Mr. Runyon says that the amount to be
spent for the mining display and its at
tendant advertising features has not been
decided on. Since the appointment of thi
commission the exposition committee of
the Miners' Association has not yet taken
any steps in the matter. There is a wido
field for effective effort in getting all the
| advertising possible out of the small but
I fine and comparatively prominent exhibit
I and the Paris Exposition provides the
! greatest opportunity in sight for letting
I the mining investors of the world know
what a rich and virgin field for mining
capital California affords.
A number of the mining machinery and
supplies men of Los Angeles and some
others have issued a call for a meeting In
Los Angeles on July 13. when it is pro
posed to form a miners' association for
Southern California. This will be inde
| pendent or and opposed to the promising
â  Southern California branch of the Cali
fornia Miners' Association, organized a
few weeks ago. The circular of invita
tion says in part:
"The object and duties of the associa
tion, when formed, will, in part.be to make
better known the advantages that our
mining districts offer as a field for profit
able investments; also to co-operate to
ward the enactment of such laws as will
protect our mineral lands, and protect the
miner in the ursuit of his occupation
and such other purposes as shall promote
the best interests of the mining industry
of Southern California."
The success of such an investment will
be regretted by many friends of the indus
try, as it would divide and weaken rather
than combine and strengthen the influence
of the miners of the State in securing
legislation and otherwise fostering the in
dustry.
Crude oil has gone up in price and at
i Los Angeles sold last week at from M
: cents to $1 05. The rise in the cost of cas
i ing has checked drilling and checked the
I supply. The strong gushers recently
struck at Fullerton have subsided. The
Loftus-Graham well has fallen from 000
to 200 barrels a day and the big gusher
struck by the Santa Fe Company wIU
have to be pumped.
j Coalinga, in Fresno County, is becoming
! the banner field. The San Joaquin alley
1 oil craze increases. Many new com
i panics are constantly forming and much
! new prospecting work is being started in
i Kern, Tulare. Kings and Fresno counties
especially. San Francisco capitalists are
taking hold of the new fields. The Krey
enhagen field, twenty-five miles south or
Coalinga, has developed oil at 050 feot in
the 800 acres of the Kreyenhagen Oil Cnm
-1 pany. One stratum of oil sand is reported
to be 300 feet thick. A fine quality of
: kerosene has been distilled from this oil
'â  experimentally. The Panoche oil district
in Fresno and the McKlttrick and Elwood
districts, in Kern County, are attracting
1 much attention.
A Placerville dispatch to The Call says:
General Juan C. Alvarado of London is
visiting the Darling mine near George
town to inspect the property. Gen
eral'Alvarado is at the head of an Eng
lish syndicate that recently purchased
the Darling Mine. The mine was a rich
producer in the early higtory of quartz
mining in this State and was worked to
a depth of 200 feet. The mine has been
un watered, and the new owners propose
to continue sinking until a depth of 500
feet has been reached.
XV. C. Ralston, vice president of the
California Miners' Association, who has
returned from an Eastern trip in connec-
tion and 250,000 gallons of water is
pumped daily from the river to
keep up the artificial lake and
operate the machine. The mass
ive machinery and the big movable

New York by President Douglass ami !
I Secretary Rosslter Raymond of the
j American Institute of Mining Engineers
; that over 200 members of the institute j
: would doubtless attend the annual meet- !
| inp in San Francisco in September. The
: total number of visitors will probably
reach a thousand, and among them will
be several prominent foreign mining
engineers.
One of the interesting old mines being
resuscitated la the Valley View copper
mine in Placer County, better known as
the "Whiskey Digging" mine. In past
years three quartz mills have been erect
ed at the mine and removed. A San Fran
â  Isco company is now developing the
property for copper and gold, with good
prospects. According to reliable state
ments this property and adjoining ledges
contain a greater variety of minerals
than perhaps any other one locality
known. Australia has one similar de
posit. Besides gold, silver, copper, zinc
and other ores there are many other in
teresting minerals, Including- molybdenum
and tourmaline.
Agents of the mines in trouble witli
s-trikers at Wallace and "Wardner. Idaho,
have been trying with small success Jo
get California miners to take the place
of the strikers. Special efforts have been
made along the mother lode and at Iron
Mountain to secure men, but California
provides plenty of work for any compe
tent miner now and the job offered j:ad
no attractions anyway.
The American River, near Folsom. is
to have another gnld dredge. Boston men
have secured 100 acres and are prospecting
other properties. They will put in the
biggest and best dredge obtainable and
more are contemplated.
A Boston syndicate represented by C.
D. Galvin has bonded for development
nine copper and gold claims on Squaw
Creek, six miles from Kennet, Shasta
County. Much money will be spent in
the development operations. Many other
similar operations are in progress through
that promising region.
A $3000 pocket gave local fame to the
O'Hara claim at Browns Flat, Tuolumne
County, last week. One chunk of gold
weighed two pounds.
The Pennsylvania mine of Grass Val
ley, as a result of a new 10-stamp mill and
good ore. has declared Its thirtieth month
ly dividend of $10,300, or 20 cents per
share, four times the amount that has
been declared regularly. The stockhold
ers paid $55.000 In assessments before div
idends arrived, and the last dividend
made the cash returns to date equal the
assessments. Now they have a grood mine
and a good Income. That Is what Califor
nia mines can do when money is invested
wisely.
A number of copper properties have
been sold or bonded during the week

The British battleship Hannibal. 14.0W

about six months, recently made a long
distance run at sea. during which she av

forced draught was 17.5 knots, and her
performance under service conditions ex
ceed the expectations by over one knot.
Krupp. by a new system of hardening
armor plates, gives a neater thickness
of hnrdness and a harder surface to the
plates. Thp improvement is effected by
adding 25 per cent more nickel than for
merly. The cost per ton is thereby in
creased to about ?400 per tnn. but this in
creased cost, it is believed, will be offset
by the less quantity that may be required
on account of the improved quality of
the armor.

Startling disclosures of the inefficient
state of the Italian navy have recently)

I of examiners to the Minister of Marine.
j The navy list bears the names of twelvfc
: battleships and nine armored cruisers, the
I oldest built in 1864 and four launched in
| 1597 but still uncompleted. Of the battle
ships the Affondatore. Duilio â¢and ijepttttta
! are only fit for coast guards, and the
; Italia may be utilized as a floating bat

] condemned for sea service and good for

Castelfigardo. Marco Polo. Maria Pia
and San Martino. Of the fifty-two un
j armored vessels, classed as cruisers and
I torpedo-gunboats, five of the fourth class

transports or as coasting cruisers. The
ships of the sixth class and the two of
the seventh class are absolutely useless.
| The five torpedo boats of the first class,

f.\v destroyers would play havoc with
this fleet. In case of -war only three "of

further sea service would be found to re
quire many defects to be made good be

Haunts.
Albert Smith, alias English, who as
\ saulted Policeman Minihan of the South

up in the City Prison. He was arrested .
' last evening on Sixth street by Police Of
j ficer Riordan, who was with Minihan
when he was assaulted.
Minihan was standing at Sixth and Mtn
j na streets, when he saw two men fighting j
on the opposite corner. He placed themun- |
der arrest and started with them for the
nearest patrol box. After ringing in for I
the wagon Smith, alias English, accosted
the officer and demanded of him to release
the prisoners.
By this time a large crowd had col
lected, and urged on by Smith, several
young hoodlums started to assault Mini
ban. Releasing the men he had under ar
rest, the policeman grabbed two of the |
most belligerent of the crowd. At this j
! juncture Smith sneaked up behind Mini- j
ban and struck him in the back of the
neck. As Minihan turned around ihe
vicious fellow smashed him in the face,
breaking his nose and severely bruising
his left eye. Minihan was knocked sense- |
less by the blow, and as he fell to the
Biaewalk two of Smith's friends repeat
edly kicked him in the stomach.
Smith, seeing Officer Riordan approach
ing, took to his heels and disappeared
down Sixth Btreet Riordan managed to
j arrest two of the gang, but not until he j
was also beaten by their companions. He j
received a blow in the right eye and an-
I other one in the back of the neck. Mini

THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JUNE 26, 1899.
CAPTAIN WARE
TO CO BEFORE
A FINAL BOARD
This Is Col. Forwood's
Recommendation.
WARE IS UNFIT FOR SERVICE
FORTS INSPECTED BY CONGRESS
MAN HULL AND PARTY.
Valencia, Pennsylvania and City of
Para Will Be the Next Trans
ports to Sail â Death of a
Recruit.
The board of surgeons that recently ex
amined Into the mental condition of Cap
tain Isaac P. Ware, assistant surgeon,
; has submitted Its report to Colonel For
wood, chief surgeon of the department,
and he in turn has forwarded the report
to General Shafter with the recommenda
tion that Captain Ware be ordered before
j a retiring board. This can mean but one
| thing, and that is that the first board has
' found the young surgeon unfit for further
I service in the army. An account of the
unfortunate officer's condition has already
been published in The Call. He became
addicted to the use of a drug, which he
took at times in such quantities as to
mentally unfit him for the proper per
: formance of his duties. Captain Ware be
! came a slave to the drug by reason of a
I physical complaint. It was to relieve his
i suffering that he first took the drug, but
{ finally it got the better of him.
From the fact that Colonel Forwood has
recommended that he be ordered before a
retiring board it is evident that Captain
Ware's chances of remaining In the army
â¢ are small. The young doctor is well liked
by all who know him, and only the kind
est expressions are to be heard for hrin.
Congressman Hull, chairman of the
Committee on Military Affairs, who with
several other members of Congress and
! a party of their lady friends are nere for
! a few "days on pleasure, were the guests
of General Shafter again yesterday. The
party visited the Presidio in the after
noon, where they were joined by Colonel
Freeman and a number of the officers at
the post. They were taken to Fort Point
and inspected the coast defenses. They
inspected the 10 and 12 inch guns, the
mortar batteries and the dynamite guns.
The party then continued to the Cliff
House, where they were greatly interested
in the seals.
The probable order of the sailing of i.ie
next transports will be the Valencia.
Pennsylvania and the City of Para. It is
not known positively just what troops
they will carry, but the following assign
ments, according to General Babeock. are
probably the order in which the troops
will go on these vessels. The Valencia
will take four companies and the head
quarters of the Twenty-fifth Infantry,
now at Fort Logan. On the Pennsyl
vania will go four companies of the
Twenty-fifth Infantry and three com
panies" of the Twenty-fourth Infantry.
The City Of Para Will take Troops H. M.
D and H of the Fourth Cavalry with
headquarters and a company of 150 en
gineers from WilletS Point, New York.
In adition to the troops named, each ves
sel will carry fmm the casual detachment
a sufficient "number of men to complete
their capacity.
Company B, Twenty-fifth Infantry.
d Lieutenant Allen Parker com
mandlng, arrived at the Presidio yester
day from Fort Wlngate. Troop F, Sixth
Cavalry, Captain Elon F. AYilcox com
manding, from Fort I>?avenworth, is ex
pected to arrive at the Presidio this
morning. This troop may form a part of
the permanent garrison or it may be sent
to Sequoia Park, orders received at the
Presidio yesterday from department head
quarters ate not clear upon this point.
Major Alfred C. Glrard, surgeon, has
been assigned to the command of the gen
eral hospital at the Presidio, and in addi
tion he has been ordered to relieve Major
Matthews of command of the old general
hospital. This part of the order, however.
doea not go into effect until the first of
the month. Acting Assistant Surgeon
Charles H. Steams has been ordered to
report for duty at the general hospital at
the Presidio.
Private Frederick G. Killyn, Company
X, casual detachment, died at the general
hospital at the Presidio on Saturday night
of typhoid fever. His remains will prob
ably be shipped East to his family.

Intention of the Mission people to have
Its share of the good things free of cost
to its own people.
Incidentally with this the federation
discussed some, minor matters appertain
ing to the work of the organization. One
was a resolution introduced by Major B.
McKlnne condemning the municipal offi
cials who have violated their pledges by
joining in an action to defeat the inten
tion of the people who voted for them on
the positive understanding that they were
only elected for one year.
A. S. Lillie drew the attention of the
members to the deplorable condition of
the three roads leading southward out of
the city into San Mateo County, these
roadways are covered with dust and rub
bish, notwithstanding the Supervisors ap
propriate $10,000 annually for keeping the
county roads in condition.
The secretary was instructed to write
a letter to the Sheriff requesting him to
put some of the prisoners in the branch
jail to work with a street sprinkler on the
Mission road. Secretary Griffith intro
duced the following resolution:
Resolved, That the Federation of
Mtesion Improvenment Clubs indorses
the petition of the Mission Five-Mile
Club, the Ocean View Club and the
San Francisco South Club No. 1, ask
ing that the pound limits be extended
throughout the various districts asked
for in the several petitions now before
the Supervisors.
W. J. Cuthbertson, president of the
Market-street Improvement Club, who
acted as chairman of the meeting, in the
absence of Chris Stader, stated that it
would be a good idea for the members
of the federation to attend a meeting at
Social Hall, on Turk street, on next
Wednesday evening, when President
Dohrmann of the Merchants' Association
will deliver a lecture on "Municipal Gov
ernment."
PORTUGUESE MAKE MERRY.
The Annual Reunion at Shell Mound
Park a Big Success.
The Portuguese Protective and Benevo
lent Association gave its twenty-eighth
annual outing at Shell Mound Park yes
terday, and, as usual, the affair was a
big success. The association is a power
in the local Portuguese colony and has
accomplished a great deal of good. It
numbers 250 members, pays out over $4000
yearly in benefits and has $8500 in tne
treasury as a reserve fund.
The members assembled in the morning
at the hall, 510 Bush street, and marched
to the ferry, headed by a brass band.
Over fifteen hundred picnickers gathered
at the pleasure grounds and made merry
until compelled to desist by darkness.
Dancing in both pavilions was the prin
cipal enjoyment and was under the direc
tion of Floor Manager Benjamin Silveira,
assisted by M. Benjamin.
The committee of arrangements con
sisted of J. F. Bernard, Frank Souza,
Frank Almada and John Luis.
The officers in attendance were Presi
dent A. S. Martin. Recording Secretary A.
L. Quaresma, Financial Secretary J. J.
Rafael, Deacon J. J. Collhu and Treas
urer J. Baptlsta.
The Golden Jubilee.
At the meeting of the Odd Fellows' ju
bilee executive committee held Saturday
there were presented reports from the
various sub- committees, which showed
that considerable work is being done and
that the prospects are the three days'
celebration in October will be the grand
est fraternal event that has ever been ar
ranged for in this State.
Presidio Lodge announced that it would
in the near future arrange an entertain
ment to raise money to contribute to the
jubilee fund and that if the sum expected
is not realized the deficit would be made
up from the lodge treasury.

SACRAMENTO, June 25.â Watsonville
played an errorless game to-day and the
veteran, George Harper, assisted by his
stone wall, succeeded in shutting out the
localsâ the first trick of the kind since the
: organization of the club. Harper was an
I enigma throughout and was touched for
I but three hits. Harvey was in fine form,
i but his field was slightly ragged, only one
of the two runs made by the Beet Grow
-1 ers being earned. Harvey was touched
: for only six hits. The features of the
game were the base running of McLaugh
lin and the superior fielding of Plake, Mc-
Carty and Brockoff. Score:

BLUE AND GOLD
OARSMEN WIN
AT EL CAMPO
Show Dashing Style
in First Start.
The rowing regatta hoITI yesterday at
El Campo w;.s a decided success. Thougb
ty was dull and cloudy, ;i large
crowd was ii attendance and the races
were carried out with commendable
promptitude. The water up to 1 o'clock
in the afternoon whs smooth, and thougb
the breeze freshened considerably after
that hour, there was at no time any sea
running. The most Interesting event of
the day was the winning of the junior
Lurge race by the crew from the Univer
sity of California, which came to the
start In good condition, establishred a
lead early in the rare and never lost it.
The victory of the blue and gold was
popular among the oarsmen, and the uni
versity boys w.-re the recipients of many
c ongratulations.
The two divisions of the Naval Militia,
N. G. C, in their ten-oared cutters, rowed
a hard race, which was productive of
much interest. The senior barge race
was wen by the Alamedas, though the
Ariel* made them work for their victory.
The Dolphin intermediate crew, entered
for the senior barge race, was without
Victor Caglieri, the bow oar, and C. M.
Farrell was substituted for him. Every
man in the boat had had a previous race.
A. W. Pape having taken part in the
canoe and relay swimming races; W. O.
Patch having rowed a hard race with C.
C. Dennis in the senior out-rigged sK.ff
event; George Baker having won the
Junior outrigged skiff race against four
competitors, and having stroked the
junior barge crew, and C. M. Farrell, wno
rowed No. 2in the junior barge. The re
lay swimming race between teams of ten
men from the Olympic and Lurllne clubs
was close and exciting, the Olympics
keeping the lead for the first seven or
eight relays, but the Lurlines overcoming
it and winning in the last two or three.
The Olympics were without the services
of J. Hobson and Otis Crable, two of their
best swimmers, yet were beaten by oniy
a narrow margin.
The four-oared barge â¢ race, between
crews of the architectural .class of the
Humboldt Evening High School and Com
pany II of the League of the Cross
Cadets, was won by the latter. In the
senior outrigged skiff race W. O. Patch,
handicapped by a heavier boat, had a
formidable opponent in Dr. C. C. Dennis,
but stuck gamely to his work and made a
very close iinish. Dennis won. The re
sults of the races follow:
Junior outraged skiff raceâ Won by George
Baker of the Dolphins, George Collopy of the
Pioneers second. M. J. Breen of the South Ends
third, Warner Lubbock of the Alaiti'ilas fourth.

Distance, seven-eighths of a mile. Won by
one length. Time, six minutes.
The course was considerably changed
from the one formerly used, and In the
opinion of both oarsmen and spectators
the change was for the better. The start
was made some three hundred yards, to
the south of the landing stage of the
steamer, thence northward three-quarters
of a mile to and around the stakes, thence
about half a mile to the finishing line, op
posite the dance hall on the picnic
grounds. This arrangement gave the spec
tators a full view of all the most interest-,
Ing parts of the race, and enabled the
oarsmen to keep closer In to the shore,
where the water Is smoother. The fol
lowing officials were In charge of the re
gatta:

er; A. M. Stone, marshal of the course: M.

GLADIATOR IS
THE SPEEDIEST
SENT TO SLIPS
Wins the Open Stake
at Union Park.
The open Ftake at Union Park yester
day provided sensational spurt through
out, the day, an unusually high class lot
of flogs being sent to the slips. Gladiator
and Lottie M were the contestants when
the filial round w:is reached, and a grand
race resulted. Lottie M, the great black
and white bitch belonging to H. Lynch,
led from tho time they left tho hands
of Slipper Wren. They raced across the
field after one of the srongeat hares of
the day, with Lottie three lengths in the
lead.
She secured the first turn, but the hare,
turning back to Gladiator, placed him.
He proved too strong and too clever for
his opponent, and lost no ground from
that time on. Before the hare finally es
caped the hounds gave as great an exhi
bition of coursing as was ever witnessed
on this coast. Gladiator's superior work
on the hare gained him the flag and the
stake. The winner is owned by James
Dean, and worked his way into the final
of the Champion slake last week with
his kennel mate, Connemarra.
In the sixth round the talent picked
Young America to beat Gladiator, offering
odds of 5 to 3 1-2. Young America led
almost to the hare, but the latter, turn
ing toward Gladiator, gave him the first
turn. After this he did most of the work
and killed.
The sapling stake for dogs was won by
I. McCabe's Craig Boy after a long
course with Agamemnon.

"DUTCH" NEAL
HAS FOUGHT HIS
LAST BATTLE
Death Follows His
Collapse.
BLOOD CLOT ON THE BRAIN
THE PUGILIST UNCONSCIOUS TO
THE END.
The Fatal Result of His Bout With
Peppers Due to the Poor Con
dition in Which He En
tered the Ring.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, June 26.â "Dutch" Neal, the
St. Louis pugilist, who fell unconscious in
the ring last Wednesday night in the
sixth round of a glove contest with Harry
Peppers, the California middleweight,
died to-day without having regained con
sciousness. Neal's death is attributed to
a blood clot on the brain resulting from
overexertion while in an unfit physical
condition. Peppers was arrested as soon
as it became apparent that Neal's condi
tion was serious, and is now in jail in di -
fault of $2000 bonds.
The battle which resulted in Neal's
death took place at the Ade.lphi Theater
and was a six-round contest for a purs.
Neal was given two weeks notice, Dut
when he appeared in the ring he was so
fat and flabby that his condition caused
comment. There was little fighting be
tween the two, but the agile l'-ppers kept
his stocky opponent constantly on the
move, and when the sixth round was
called Neal was puffing badly.
After a minute's sparring I''ppers land
ed a light right on Neal's ear. The blow
unbalanced the St. Louis man. and as he
reeled sideways one of his feet slipped off
the platform and he fell to the floor of the
ring. Referee George Siler had just fin
ished counting ten when Neal rolled out
of the ring onto the floor, his head strik
ing with a noise that was heard through
out the theater. He got up a moment
later, but soon after being assisted to his
dressing-room he became unconscious and
remained so until he died.
Neal was well known in pugilistic cir
cles Among his important battles Was
a knockout of "Billy" Stift several years
ago. He was defeated two months ago
by "Tommy" Ryan.
Police officials say that no further ar
rests will be made in the case, for the
present at least.

Threw Eggs at a Socialist.
John Speak, a socialistic orator who
gathers a large crowd every night at the
corner of Grant avenue and Market
streets, was treated to a fusillade of rot
ten eggs Saturday, and for a time it
looked as if a general riot was imminent.
The eggs were thrown by unknown per-
Bone from the roof of the clothing store
at the southeast corner of Grant avenue
and Market streets. Policemen Murphy
and Marshall, who were in the neighbor
hood, quelled the disturbance, much to
the Fatisfaction of Speak, who contlnin-.i
his address after quiet was restored and
the supply of eggs gave out.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JUNE 26, 1899.
DEFENDS THE
PRINCIPLE OF
UNION LABOR
Rev. J. N. Beard's
Able Address.
STRIKES ARE JUSTIFIABLE
â * _
A LARGE AUDIENCE AT GRACii
M. E. CHURCH.
He Declares That if Low Wages and
Long Hours Mean Civilization
Then China Is in the
Vanguard.
The Rev. J. N. Board of Grace Metho
dist Episcopal Church held the close at
tention of a large audience last night. His
subject was "The Church and the Labor
Unions."
The pastor dealt thoroughly with the
topic of organized labor. While admit
ting the Inadvisability and evil results of
many strikes, he thoroughly Indorsed the
principles involved in the boycott and the
strike, even the sympathetic strike, as
being legitimate means of waging the In
dustrial war between labor -and capital.
In part he said:
"The interests of labor and capital are
not identical, but they are reciprocal.
! Neither can succeed at the expense of
! the other. Labor seeks equality of bar
â  gaining power, and this it can best effect
| through organization. The organization
j of labor tends to prevent the monopoly of
i wealth, because only the strongest bust-
I ness concerns can stand against the ex
| actions of the unions. On the same prin
ciple combinations of capital necessitate
the union of laborers in self defense. Be
cause we cannot differentiate labor from
man it has a humanitarian aspect. Men,
! even considered as laborers, are not like
, so many hales of hay or bags of potatoes,
to be bought and sold without reference
ito their humanity. Laborers demand a
' living wage, but this does not mean a
1 simple subsistence. We are all interested
â¢ In a high standard of living for laborers
! as well as others, because this is a eon
; dltion of a high civilization. If low wages
and long hours mean civilization then
China is in the vanguard. I cannot be
lieve that any man who must give all his
, waking hours to the struggle for bread is
I a free man.
"All unions are Interested In attaining
i their legitimate objects by conciliation,
â  when possible, but they are all ready to
I report to war. in the shape of strikes and
boycotts, when necessary. Between labor
! and capital, as between nations, arbitra
tion and peace are most probable when
I each is able to care for Itself; in other
: words, to prepare for a strike, by thor
ough organization, is frequently to avert
one. The feeling which prompts the harsh
treatment of non-unionists at the time of
a strike is natural and founded on Justice,
, though not justifiable If It proceeds to
lawlessness.
"While there Is no defense for many
things done under the name of hoycott,
the principle cannot be successfully at
tacked. This congregation Is constantly
recommended to boycott saloons and such
institutions. Concerning sympathetic
strikes, where men with no grievance of
their own strike to assist their fellows. I
can only say that my earliest recollec
tions are connected with the great war
of the rebellion, which was nothing more,
in one aspect, than a great sympathetic
strike. And the same remark applies to
our recent war with Spain. In another
aspect trades unionism is also an active
check on the importation into this coun
try of undesirable, cheap foreign labor."
AUTOMOBILE CRAZE
REACHES THE CITY
Tn the line of accidents It was extreme
ly quiet at the park yesterday, but the
police and hospital physicians are antici
pating a brisk time in the near future.
The automobile, or horseless carriage,
craze has assumed such proportions In
the East that many of the wealthy of
this city have determined to get in line.
In fact, there are a few of these four
wheeled machines in the city at the pres
ent time, but owing to their horse-fright
ening propensities they have up to date
been excluded from the park. San Fran-
Cisco must be up to date, however, the
wealthy say, and the eoulne animals of
this commonwealth might as well prepare
for the worst.
In consequence It is said that in a short
time the Park Commissioners will be
called upon to revoke their order exclud
ing machines from the park calculated to
stampede horses, and allow the automo
biles free access. It is during tr| process
of initiating the horses and consoling
them upon their ultimate consignment to
the canning factory that the police and
surgeons anticipate a busy time, but they
are ready for all emergencies.
M-rrilf Owens, an insurance clerk, who
resides at IS3O O'Farrell street, was ar
rested by the bicycle path policeman for
fast cycling. When taken he was going
at a great speed and submitted to arrest
with apparent indifference. On the way
to the station, however, he met a crowd
of his friends, and the policeman says
that all hands jumped him and endeav
ored to release the young man. When
Captain Thompson heard this he ordered
the prisoner locked up for the offense, in-
Ftead of warning and then releasing him,
as in done when people violate the cycling
law for the first time.
The usual crowd assembled at the
Chutes yesterday and enjoyed the various
features, as did the guests at Sutro
Baths. The results of the aquatic con
tests at the baths are as follows: Fifty
yard dash, noviceâ H. Seehach first. J.
Laird second. 100-yard dash for juvenilesâ
M. Gardner first. F. Faker second. 100
--yard amateur raceâ T. Cook first, C. Royal
second. 100-yard tub raceâ W. Dunford
first. A. Bandain second, C. Augustus
third. High diving for boysâ Won by R.
Cooke, C. Augustus second. Trick and
fancy springboard divingâ Won by C.
Royal, C. Augustus second.

Theosophical Society Meets.
The Universal Brotherhood of the The
osophlcal Society held a meeting last
night in the Academy of Sciences Hall.
H. B. Monges delivered a speech on the
real and Ideal, after which the meeting
was thrown open for a general expres
sion of views on various theosophlcal sub
jects, and some very Interesting and In
structive discussions ensued.
CAMP MEETING OF THE
HOLINESS ASSOCIATION
OAKLAND. June 25.â The Paci
fic Coast Holiness Association
will hold a camp meeting at
Keulah Park. East Oakland,
beginning June 29 and contin
uing over two Sundays. The associa
tion was organized in ISSO by a few
earnest Christians, who felt the neces
sity of more aggressiveness in certain
lines of religious activity. Represent
ative^ were sent out all over the
coast, and many of th<# various forms
of mission activity now manifest had
their origin in the work established by
the society.
The first refuge home in San Fran
cisco that became a permanency was
founded by the society and is now one
of the most successful of the Florence
Crittenton homes. George Newton, the
president, was the first presiding offi
cer. He was formerly a Methodist
minister, beginning his labors on this
coast thirty years ago, and has been
identified with the holiness movement
for twenty years. He will superintend
the present camp meeting. Mr, New
ton has recently opened a benevolence
in Oakland called the Christian Home
for Unemployed Girls, and contem
plates the establishment of a home
for wornout aged people.
HELPED US TO EMPIRE
IN THE PHILIPPINES
When the Pacific Mail steamship City of
Rio de Janerlo docked last evening she
: landed three distinguished passengers
; who have had considerable to do with the
making of history since last their feet
i touched the soil of California.
They are Captain N. M. Dyer, who com
; manded the Baltimore at that famous bat
.' tie of Manila Bay; Captain M. A. Waiker,
I who commanded the Concord, and J. C.
] Wise, medical director of Admiral
Dewey's fleet. The three officers are on
their way home after having completed
: their terms of service on the Asiatic sta
, tion. They will remain in the city but
a few days, when they will proceed to
their several homes, whence they will
report to the Navy Department for duty.
It is not likely, however, that they will be
detailed for active service for some
. months to come, as the department will,
j no doubt, give them a chance In which
! to recuperate and see something of tneir
j families before again calling upon them
! for their services.
When seen last evening at the Occi
-1 dental they were disinclined to taJk. Too
modest to speak of their own exploits and
i âwith the example of the jovial Coughlin
still fresh In their mindsâ too politic to
â  criticize affairs in the Philippines, they
! confined themselves to expressions of
satisfaction at once more getting home
' and inquiries after news of the world
they have been so long shut off from.
When questioned concerning the cap
; ture of Hollo and the protest of Captain
i Wilde of the cruiser Boston against Gen
â¢ eral Miller receiving his promotion as a
reward for taking the place, they had lit
tle to say beyond a statement indorsing
: Wilde's action and claiming for the navy
the credit of the capture and occupation
of the city.
Captain Walker left Manila and went as
far as Hongkong with Dewey on the
; Olympi.i. He reports the admiral in good
th, though considerably run down and.
exhausted from his long strain of anxiety
j and responsibility.
Captain James M. Forsyth relieved
Captain Dyer in command of the Balti
more and Captain Walker was relieved of
1 his command of the Concord by Com
mander Seth M. Ackerley.
WANT THE BERLIN RAIL.
Teamsters and Improvement Clubs
Making a Fight for Bet
ter Streets.
A general movement is on foot in the
city to compel street railway companies
to adopt the Berlin grooved rail, in pref
erence to the T rail now in use. It is
claimed that this rail presents a smooth
Burface and not only adds to the appear
ance of the street, but is a great con
venience to teamsters and drivers gener
ally.
At the meeting of the Draymen and
Teamsters' T'nion held Saturday reso- j
lutlons requesting the Board of Super
visors to compel railway companies to
use this rail were adopted, and similar
action was taken by the executive com
mittee of the Richmond Improvement
Association at the instigation of E. P. E.
Troy. >
Rio Janeiro in Port.
The Rio Janeiro arrived from the Orient !
yesterday afternoon and docked at the
i Pacific Mail Steamship Company's dock.
1 She brought the fumigated mail of the i
Nippon Maru and about forty cabin pas
i sengcrs. among whom were Captain N.
M. Dyer and Captain Asa Walker of the
; navy. No Incidents worthy of mention
occurred during the voyage, and agree
able weather caused the trip to be a very
pleasant one. Mrs. Anna Cummlngs, sec
retary of the C. P. R. R. and S. P. R. R.
Mutual Benefit Association, was also on
the passenger list.
Accidentally Shot.
Michael Monahan was shot while in the
saloon of A. Schwedt at the corner of
Florida and Twenty-third streets last
night by the accidental discharge of a
Winchester rifle. The rifle was upon the
draining board in the rear of the bar, and
in some way while drawing the beer
Schwedt struck it and discharged it. Ine
bullet passed through the counter, also
through Monahan's leg and into the body
of a dog. Captain Gillln had the wounded
man removed to the City and County Hos
pital, where Dr. J. A. Lane dressed the
wound, which Is not serious.
Fractured His Ankle.
W. McMillan of the Journal of Com
merce while jumping from a car at Larkin
and Eddy streets yesterday morning frac
tured his right ankle. He was taken to
the Receiving Hospital and later to the
City and County Hospital.

COL. C. R. GREENLEAF
TALKS OF THE WAR
A good-sized audience filled the First
Presbyterian Church last night to hear
Colonel Charles R. Greenleaf, medical In
spector of the United States army, speak
of his experiences In Cuba and Porto
Rico. Colonel Greenleaf, who is here to
take charge of the sanitary affairs of the
troops returning- from Manila, was the
medical inspector of the Eastern camps,
where the soldiers were quartered after
having served in the tropics. He had
under his direct supervision at Savannah
13.000 and at Harrisburg 6000 returned
soldiers.
The colonel said that during the war
one thought had often occurred to him,
and that was that the people at home had
little conception of the suffering and
misery that was incident to war. He con
tinued: "The first six months or year of
a wnr are very productive of sickness. It
takes about that time to teach a soldier
how to keep his person and surroundings
clean. The prime duty of the medical
staff is to gauge the percentage of sick
ness among the soldiers for the first half
year. We count on about 15 per cent of
sick men to S per cent of those Injured in
battle. The Red Cross societies of Europe
an' organized under more favorable con
ditions than ours. They have the advan
tages of centralization and systematic
distribution. The necessity of these two
things in this work is one of the lessons of
the war."
The speaker described the condition of
the troops when he reached Siboney in a
very graphic manner. He said: "it was
impossible to keep the men from exposing
themselves. They seemed entirely de
void of caution and could not be kept
from the infected houses. One incident
touched me deeply," eald he. "The hos
pital at Siboney was crowded. Every
nurse and attendant had come clown with
the contagion. At my request a captain
of the Twenty-fourth (colored) called for
volunteers from his company to act as
nurses. The company stepped forward as
one man."
After describing some interesting inci
dents of the Porto Hican campaign, the
colonel told of the scenes and conditions
in Cuba. He said that Senator Proctor's
letter before the war does not begin to
express the suffering. He saw more suf
fering, more dreadful misery in tftat
island than in all the rest of his lifetime
put together.

Borne Strong Reasons Given by a
Prominent Citizen Why the
"Home of Infamy" Should
Be Suppressed.
Property owners and residents of the
North Beach district are still up in arms
against the "Hotel Nymphia" project. It
would seem that the residents of the dis
trict in which the proposed hotel is to be
situated are alive to every move of the
men who have Its future in their keep-
Ing. To-morrow, when the Fire Commit
tee, of the Board of Supervisors meets, it
will be confronted by an array of the
leading spirits opposed to the Nymphia.
Rev. Father T. Caraher of St. Francis,
Rev. Dr. I'rmy of the First Methodist
Eepiscopal Church, Captain John Foley,
P. A. Buckley, John J. Dudey, Captain
P. Conni r and Walter Eager, with the
aid of their attorney, John J. Barrett,
will try and convince the committee that
by granting a permit to the owners of
the buildings fronting on Stockton street
from 1108 to IVI2 it will disregard the
wishes of a majority of tlu; residents in
the northern part of the city and will b3
a promoter of vice.
t the foremost objec

Ing adjoining the Hotel Nymphia to s<
cure permission to make alterations on
their property Is an ignoble one and is
simply for the purpose of excavating

SHARKEY THE STAR OF
THE GLEN PARK SHOW
The Ex-Sailor Spars Four Rounds With Spider
Kelly and Makes a Speech to an
Admiring Multitude.
PT'GILIST TOM SHARKEY, the self-styled "champion heavyweight of
the world." was the stellar attraction at Glen Park yesterday afternoon
and no one appreciated that fact more than the ex-sailor. Sharkey was
billed to box four rounds with Spider Kelly at the pleasure resort and
several thousand people swarmed out over the hills to the scene of the prom
ised exhibition. Many of them had never had the honor of gazing- at the
muscular form of the pugilistic wonder and they were determined not to
overlook the present opportunity.
The exodus from the city commenced about noon and for the next four
hours the electric cars on the San Mateo line were taxed to their utmost ca
pacity. Passengers clung to the sides and rear and even clambered upon the
roofs of the cars, and when driven from the latter hung by their hands to the
sign that ran along its edge. Others clung to the window frames and to one
anoth-r until thore was nothing left to cling to. Occasionally a passenger
lost his grip and went rolling and tumbling along the road, but, although sev
eral of the victims received severe shakings up, they invariably refused to
give up thr- trip and retire for repairs.
The "event" took place at 4 o'clock in a 12-foot ring that had been erect
ed on a raised platform in the children's playground. Both boxers appeared
promptly on time resplendent in green tights. Kelly was first introduced by
the master of ceremonies as the lightweight champion of the Pacific Coast.
When the sailor was introduced as the heavy-weight champion of the world
the crowd yelled and Sharkey smiled his thanks. Tim McGrath was next
introduced as the referee and the boxers went to work.
Sharkey looked big enough to swallow his shadowy opponent, but Kelly
ducked and .sidestepped in the most approved fashion and the blows aimed at
his head usually went wide. "Dewey's Destroyer," as Sharkey has rechrist
ened his good ri?ht arm, was not brought into action to any great extent, and
to that fact the Spider probably owes possession of an undamaged anatomy.
The sailor was as live as a cricket, however, and although Kelly was suffer
ing from a severe case of indisposition the exhibition was eminently satis
factory and met with the unqualified approval of the audience. At the
conclusion of the bout the crowd Insisted upon a speech from Sharkey,. and
their desire in this direction was gratified. Sharkey is not an orator, but he
has sufficient "savey" to stop when he has said his say. Here is his speech
"Ladies and Gentlemen:* I am pleased with my reception here to-day, be
ing the first time in a year I have showed here. Now you all want to see the
big championship fight. I am willing to fight here, and if the Glen Park
Club will put up as much money as the Eastern clubs I will give them the
preference.".
"Good boy, Sharkey; you can do him," yelled an admirer in the crowd
and every one, including the sailor, joined in the laugh that followed Man
ager H. I. McGill of the Glen Park Company says he has secured all the
back.rig he needs and is confident of being the successful bidder for the con
test between Sharkey and Jeffries.
"I will post a forfeit of $2500 to-morrow," he said yesterday, "guarantee
ing a purse of $40,000 for the fight. Of course some of the Eastern clubs are
talking of offering $50,000, but they will not put up that amount. Our offer
Is genuine, as the forfeit shows." ,
be erected. The move against the Hotel
Nymphia Is now growing, but no one can
tell what will happen if fhe projectors of
the vile scheme are permitted to carry
their plans to completion. The people of
this vicinity are strongly opposed to the
hotel, and if their wishes are overridden
there is a danger of an uprising not only
of the residents of North Beach but of
the entire city. The alleged North Beach
Improvement Club, which met last Tues
day night in this district, was organized
under the direct supervision of the Twin
Star Company, the corporation fonnea to
house the fallen women, and was brought
Into life for the purpose of giving some
support to the venture.
"Another reason why the scheme should
not po through ts that it is on our main
thoroughfare and the building will have
to be passed by the children on their way
to school. Again, this city gives promise
ofbecoming a military enter, and if the
Nymphia Is allowed to exist soldiers will
congregate around its doors in inebriated
states and no self-respecting women will
dare visit the vicinity. There are a hun
dred and one reasons why tTie Supervisors
should refuse the permit, and we will
enumerate them on Tuesday."
A PANEGYRIC ON
ST. ALOYSIUS
The feast of St. Aloyslus was fittingly
celebrated In St. Ignatius Cathedral yes
terday. Solemn high mass was celebrated
at 10:30 o'clock. The music was beautiful
and highly Impressive. Rev. George Burk
hard, who delivered the sermon on St.
Aloysius, said in part:
If we read the lives of the saints atten
tively, we will \if forced to admit that the
words of the prophet are most suitable to the
saint whose least we commemorate to-day.
The mercy of God has renderd him -wonder
ful during his life and after his death. Won
derful In life for his holiness and the heroic
virtues which he practiced: wonderful for be
stowing uiÂ»m him the graces which made him
BO renowned In the church; wonderful In
heaven where merits raise him to an eminent
degree of highness and glory; wonderful on
e.-irth after his death fur the many miracles,
cures w. irked after the healing of the body and
the Fanrtlfiration of the BOUI.
The virtues and the greatness of St. Aloysius
are too sublime and admirable for us t.i de
scribe. Look at the picture of Aloysius as
represented by sacred art. You will se* the
saint with downcast looks holding a Illy, a
tit emblem ol hi* Bpotless purity. Then you
will see a crown and a skull, emblems of his
utter contempt of the world, and finally be
h"|d a discipline nrid a crucifix, symbols of
his spirit and penance. It represents to our
D Inda the continued efforts of the saint for
acquiring virtue and sanctity and exhorts us
at the same time to follow his example. It is,
therefore, both edifying and instructive to
make these symbols the subject of our con
sideration.
The speaker then went on to develop
these different emblems, showing how the
innocence and the purity of St. Aloysius
was truly wonderful: how from his ear
liest childhood to the day of his death it
characterized all his thoughts, words and
actions. Continuing, he said:
What an example for our admiration and
imitation. Alas, very few imitate him in his
purity and innocence, but all can Imitate his
spirit of penance. This is what the church
calls upon us to do in her prepared address
to the saint. Oh, (iod. distributor of celestial
gifts, who hast united In the angelical youth,
Aloysius, a wonderful innocence to an equally
wonderful penance, grant that we who need
follow his Innocence may imitate his penance
to Christ, our Lord, amen.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JUNE 26, 1899.
PASSENGERS IN
A WRECK NEAR
POINT LOBOS
A Train Runs Off the
Track.
TWO COACHES CROWDED
NARROWLY ESCAPE GOING
OVER THE CLIFF.
More Than Three Hundred Pleasure-
Seekers Headed for the Cliff
House Had a Thrilling
Experience.
For a few awful seconds yesterday
afternoon more than 300 passengers on
the Ferries and Cliff House Railway felt
as if they were hanging in space pre
vious to a frightful fall down the cliffs
overlooking the Golden Gate into the wa
ters of the Pacific, a hundred feet below.
Women and children shrieked In the
agony of fear that their last moment had
come and that they were going to death
beneath the waves over the jagged rocks.
Men shouted in the universal panic, and
some jumped madly for their lives. In
some manner, little short of miraculous,
the catastrophe was averted, and the
frightened passengers live to tell the
tale.
The accident occurred shortly after 2
o'clock to the train that left the Cen- |
I tral avenue station for the beach. It was j
i made up of an engine and two coaches,
the seating capacity of which were test-
I ed by the crowd of holiday seekers going
for an otuing to the sea shore. Just bo
fore the train reached' the tunnel near
Point Lobos the engine, from some un
known cause, supposed to be a spreading
rail, jumped the track and thumped along
on the ties. The coaches followed one
after the otner. jolting frigmfuily and
i swinging heavily from side to side.
The track at the point of departure of :
tlif train was not more than fifty feet
from the verge of the cliff, which ri.ses
more than a hundred feet almost sheer
from the waters beneath. As the pas
sengers felt the wheels under them buinp
i ing along on the ties and realized that i
' the locomotive was plunging ahead wildly. !
1 with no rails to hold it in the prescribed
direction, their minds were filled with
visions of a fall over the face of rocks
!to Inevitable death. It would be impossi- i
: bio to describe the scone that ensued.
i Those who had gained their feet at the i
first bump on the ties rushed wildly to j
and fro in the small spaces between the
seats. Those who were nearest the side*
of the coaches jumped out, unmindful of
the speed of the train, preferring broken \
bones with a rhance of life ashore to
death in the ocean. Others less fortunate
ly situated were forced to keep to the
coaches, which before they could make
up their minds what to do stopped, the
engtfteer having shut off steam the in
stant he felt his wheels slip. From the
Becond he reversed his throttle till the
train was brought to a standstill was ten |
si conds of a suspense which will never be i
forgotten by those present. The mere
fact that the train was approaching a
tunnel accounted for the fortunate cir- I
cumstance that it was not being run at y
a high rate of speed. Had it been going
at its usual ' rate nothing could have
averted the catastrophe.
Alter the cars had come to a stop the
passengers alighted and made their way
afoot to the Cliff House, preferring the
walk to another experience in the coaches
that had nearly proved their coffins.
Traffic on the Ferries and Cliff House
road was obstructed the remainder of the
day while the wreckers were at work
dragging the engine and cars back on the
track. They were still busy at a late hour
last night.
SPIRITISM SHOWN
IN A NEW LIGHT
Rev. D. V. Bowen of the New Jerusa
lfm (Swedenborglan) Church delivered a
H>rmon on "Spiritism in the Light of the
.%cw Church" to his congregation last
evening. He chose for his text Tsaiah
vlii:l9: "And when they shall say unto
you seek unto them, that have familiar
spirits, and unto wizards that peep and
mutter, should not a people seek unto
their God?" In part he said:
During the past week we have had quite a
discussion In uur papers in regard to "Spirit
ism." Two scientists have just found out what
to them is very remarkablo â that spirits can
communicate with m<>n. The Hishop of Sacra
mento, while acknowledging those communica
tions, believes them to be very evil spirits from
angels who made an Insurrection in heaven and
were cast out into hell. Kut this is according
to Milton's idea. It is not taught in scripture.
Now, as it is well known that Swedenborg
claimed to have communications with the
spiritual world, saw and conversed with good
and evil spirits and with angels, and so much
is said in our sremons and in new church writ
ings generally in regard to the influence of
spirits and angels. It Is not at all strange that
one of the first questions asked by those who
are Investigating the claims of the new church
is, How does it differ from modern spiritism,
and in what respect does Swedenborg differ
from Andrew Jackson Davis and other me
diums?
The speaker then went on to show the
teachings in the Bible on the subject. He
said the scriptures showed there were two
kinds of communications, one a direct rev
elatlon and the other unauthorized and
forbidden. The first was composed of the
prophets and apostles, and the second of
necromancers, wizards, soothsayers and
"seekers unto the dead."
"The most zealous spiritist." he contin
ued, "will not claim that spiritism is a
divine revelation. The communication
from mediums are of a mixed character,
good, bad and indifferent. There is noth
ing given by modern mediums more than
was known to the new church 100 years
ago. Swedenborg received his doctrines
from the Lord while reading the word and
meditating upon it. He was a seer, not a
medium. The new church system is the
science of theology, the science of relig
ion and the science of divine and spiritual
influence. These new revelations were
the second coming of the Lord in spirit
and in power. They show how scripture
should be understood. They harmonize
seeming contradictions, clear up absurdi
ties, explain parables, unfold interior
truths and throw a flood of light upon
everything that concerns us as Spiritual
beings."
DRINK PUTS A
HOE IN HIS HANDS
Rev. Dr. John A. B. Wilson gave the last
of his sermons of "The Man With the
Hoe" series last evening. A good-sized
audience filled the Howard Street Method
ist Church. He spoke in part as follows:
You have known from the beginning that
the man with the hoe stands for the struggling,
hopeless, submerged part of our population,
\vli(.sr> roll only enables them to subsist In the
hardest of conditions. It is the custom to blame
capital, to blame our land law.", to blame our
social conditions, and I think with justice. But
I am here to tell you that the degraded laborer
Is also himself to blame for this degradation.
Ills personal habits and the business he pat
ronizes and defends has the most to do with the
degradation of our laboring classes. Liquor, as
the statistics show, is responsible largely for
the condition of many in the laboring classes
to-day. There are other wrongs to be righted,
wrongs that are oppressive. Kill this one, how
ever; grlve us a sober laboring class from top
to bottom and you can trust the workingmau
sober to Intelligently deal with all other oppres
sions.
WANTS THE CHILDREN BACK.
Mrs. C. J. Allen Seeks to Regain Con
trol of Three Girls.
Mrs. C. J. Allen, who about two years
ago had three children taken away from
her at her home, 378 Natoma street, has
consulted an attorney with a view to re
gaining control over them. It is claimed
that the California Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Children took action
in the case on the receipt of an anonym
ous letter and all sorts of allegations
have been made concerning the manner
In which Mrs. Allen waa treated in the
matter. She states that an unfair advan
tage was taken of her, and she desires to
set herself right before the public and
consequently will seek to have the chil
dren given back to her.
The children, whose names are Nellie,
Phoebe and Echo, were left on Mrs.
Allen's hands by their mothers, who had
grown tired of paying for their support.
Nellie Is now with a Mrs. Biter In Mill
Valley.
Several ladies, among others Mrs. Clara
Price. Mrs. A. Lyons and Mrs. M. Norton,
believe Mrs. Alien's story and have en
listed the sympathies of M. M. Foote in
her behalf. " What the nature of the pro
ceedings will be in the endeavor to have
the children turned over to Mrs. Allen has
not yet been decided upon. In discussing
the subject yesterday Mrs. Allen said:
"I love those children as if they were
my own and all I ask is that they be
given back to me. I will acknowledge
that appearances were against me when
the officers cane to investigate The case,
but I had been working very hard to sud
port the little ones and myself and did
not have the time to take care of them.
They had plenty to eat, however, and I
kept them comfortably clothed. The poor
little things had been deserted by their
mothers, and I had not the slightest In
tention of deserting them. I could not
give them such a home as a rich woman
might, but I did the best I could.
"It is peculiar how interested the
officers were in the case. I have heard It
said there was money coming to one of
the children, but which one I do not
know. At all events it looks as if they
would deprive me of any possible benefit. "
CYCLER WASTIE RIDES
A FAST FORTY MILES
Covers the Distance Between Oakland
and San Jose in Record-Break
ing Time.
SAN JOSE, June 25.â E. B. Wastie, a
member of the Oarden City Wheelmen,
lowered the record to-day between Oak
land and this city. He rode the distance,
a shade under forty miles, in 1 hour 46 1 Â£
minutes, being paced by four tandem
teams.
The best previous time made over the
road by a single rider was one hour and i
fifty minutes, to the credit of Eddie O. |
Kragness, the great road rider of Olym- I
pic Club Wheelmen, San Francisco. !
Wastie was delayed en route. The tire of j
his wheel punctured once, compelling !
him to change to another machine at I
.Alvarado. He was stopped three times '
between Milpitas and San Jose by a long j
freight train, which blocked his way.
The tandemites who assisted him were
Fred. Larder, Daniel J. Francis, Milton
Francis, Louis Smith, "Pie" Barnes and
J. C. Smith, all members of the Garden
City Wheelmen. Larder and Francis !
started with Wastie and accompanied him
throughout,

I day at Alameda by the narrow margin of
seven runs. Arthur Diekenson, captain

latter five. J. J. Moriarty and Fane Se
well were the only batsmen to get double
figures, the former scoring 25 and the lat
ter 15 runs. Out of a total of 94 runs il
were extras. After disposing of their

him for .'', and A. Diekenson added but 1
to the total. F. Croll made the best
jscore of the dayâ ST. and H. Bird con

CUT WITH A PENKNIFE.
Result of a Fight Between Patrick
Lynch and Another Pugilist.
Patrick Lynch, an amateur pugilist liv
ing at 32 Chesley street, quarreled with
another fighter at an early hour yester
day morning, and they adjourned to a
stable at Seventh and Bryant streets to
fight it out. How many rounds were
fought Is not known, but Lynch's op
ponent got on top of him, and, drawing
a penknife from his pocket, drew it across
Lynch's thorax.
Lynch was taken to the Receiving Hos
pital, where Dr. Bunnell stitched and
dressed his wound; but he refused to re
main, and insisted on going home. He
declined to give the name of the man who
cut him, but the police expect to arrest
his assailant.

Wigfall was sitting upon his cot and .
'Kiby was across the room from him
blacking- his shoes. .- . â â ::!>â¢ Wigfall took '
his rifle from it? rack upon the wall. This !
did not attract any one's attention, for it '
is a common thing for the soldiers to han- ]

the room saw him slip a cartridge into the
magazine of the ritle. and before the sol

him tak.^ deliberate :iim at Kiby. An in

No one seems to know what caused
Wig-fall to do such a cowardly deed. i
Th^r^ was no bad blood between Kiby and
Wigfall that any of the men know of. I
They are both in the same company and j
have their quarters in the same building.
Some of the Idlers of the company de- j

that he was not sufficiently intoxicated '
not to have known what he was doing.
He was immediately taken to the guard
house, where he was placed in close con

him. j
Major Mosoley. the surgeon of thÂ» post, :
examined Kiby's wound. The bull' en- i
tered the right leg a few inches below th^>
knee and passed entirely through the [
bone. Kiby was so affected by the shock
and pain that the major refrained from
making a thorough examination until to
day. The knee cap is affected, and from
the examination made it looks as if it was
so badly shattered as to necessitate am- j
putation of th" leg. Morphine was admin- I

SAINT JOHN THE
BAPTIST HIS THEME
Rev. F?thnr T. Canher of St." Francis
Church preached an able sermon on the
life of St. John the Baptist yesterday
mornlnp at the 11 o'clock mass. Besides
being- the Sunday within the octave of the
feast of the Saint, it marked the twenty
plxth anniversary of the well-known pas
tor's ordination. The sacred edifice was
crowded as usual. Father Caraher took
for his text: "John is his name: Luke
i:63."
The musical programme was a feature
of the services. Following are a few ex
cerpts from his Interesting address:
The* name of John signifies one favored by
(">â¢<â¢;. Our saint was called John because he
was exceedingly favored and privileged by
God. Our I>ird sunirr.iirir.es the Braces and
privileges of Ft. John when he says: "Amen,
I pay to you. there hath not risen among men
that are horn of women a greater than John
the Baptist."
Our saint is also called the Baptist for the
reason that he preached the baptism of pen
ance and bantized our Lord and many of the
Jews In the Jordan. This baptism of St. John
was not the same as our sacrament of bap
tism, but was only an external rite or ablu
tion that signified by its effects upon the body
the Interior cleansing of the soul by penance.
On the feast of Ft. John's nativity the church
proposes a shining virtue for our meditation,
but I will only dwell upon his virtue, penance
and mortification. The Baptist had not only
preached mortification, but also practiced It
in an eminent decree. In his youth he forsook
the world and the comforts of home and fled
into the deserts of Judea, where he led a
most austere and penetentlal life.
â¢ The speaker then went on to describe
St. John's mode of living and food and
drink he contended with while carrying
on his penance.
The Baptist remained In the desert until his
"thirtieth year and then left his place of re
tirement to baptize and preach penance. The
place where St. John was born is situated
about six miles to the west of Jerusalem. It
belongs to the Franciscan fathers, who have
there an Imposing church and monastery. It
was my treat privilege to celebrate mass in
the crypt of the church where St. John was
born and to administer holy communion to a
number who assisted at the mass. About eight
miles west of the place of his birth is the
- desert where he spent the greater port of his I
life and where he lived upon locusts and wild
honey.
If we aspire to the happiness of St. John
the Bantlst we must practice in some degree
at leapt his mortification in food and clothing
Never yet did a saint reach heaven that was
. not Kiven to penance and self-denial. From
the days of John the Baptist until now the
kingdom of heaven suffered violence and the
violence beareth it away.

IF CHRIST CAME
TO SAN FRANCISCO?
"If Christ Should Come to San Fran
cisco" was the subject of an Interesting
Bermon by Dr. Charles Edward Locks of
the Central Methodist Church last even
ing In Metropolitan Temple. He said In
part:
We are rapidly coming to be a nation of
cities. In the United States there are three
cities with over 1,000,000 Inhabitants; six cities
over 500,000: twelve cities over 300 000 and
thirty-two cities over 100,000; 400 cities with a
population between r.0,000 and 15,000; 360 cities
with over 10,000. and more than 700 cities of
5000 inhabitants. The great problems and pos
sibilities of our nation, therefore, are to a
large extent connected with the cities.
. If Christ Â«hould come to San Francisco how
severely would he rebuke all forms of vice
gambling, profanity and prizefighting, Impur
ity, drunkenness and profligacy. The saloons
with all their diabolical concomitants would
be driven out. Avarice and greed, with all
their cruel and devilish influences, would be
hurled down the steep places into the sea
When I think of the boys that are being
ruined and of the girls that are being de
bauched and the throngs of men and women
that are being demonized and bestlalized; when
I know of the -Bins at which so-called society
winks and In which It largely participates
when I remember the voracious Shylocks who
feed on pounds of flesh, and think of the woes
and privations when sin is everywhere in
flicting, I know that If Jesus were to come
to San Francisco he would kindly but severely
rebuke a lethargic church and a quiescent citi
zenship, and arouse men and women every
where to a mighty crusade against the vile,
vlcioup and cruel modern Saracens that hold
carnivals of vice In what might be a holy
city.
If Christ were to come to San Francisco
he would peek the needy. The needy poor,
and give them bread; the needy rich, and
plve them counsel as he went Into the house
of Zacchaeus; the needy doubter; the needy
cad hearts, and sympathize with them, as he
wept at the tomb of Lazarus. And, hear me, i

mand. A man or woman is not beyond our
obligation to serve or save because he has

The congregation was on the gui vivo,
both at the morning and evening 1 service,
expecting Dr. Locke would make the an
nouncement of his contemplated change,
but they were disappointed, as he did not
allude to the subject The evening serv
ice at the temple will be discontinued

REV. FATHER WYMAN
DISCUSSES ST. PAUL
At the 11 o'clock mass yesterday morn
ing- Rev. Father Wynian of St. Mary's
(Paullst) Church delivered an Interesting
discourse on one of St. Paul's epistles to
Timothy. In part, he said:
"For 1 know whom 1 have believed, and I j
am certain that he is able to keep that which |
] have committed to him until that day."
These words express the intt-nsity of St.
Paul's faith and hope. They were written
during his last Imprisonment; the hand that
penned them was fettered !>y chains and they
were addressed to his beloved disciple and co
worker, St. Timothy, of whom ho speaks most
t' nderly in the snme epistle, and whom he
declares he remembers daily in his prayers.
Th-' faith set forth in these words Is not,
however, peculiar and personal to Ht. Paul
himself, but belongs essentially to all Chris
tians. It might he objected that one who had
experienced ouch a miraculous conversion,
wrought such miracles and had converted such
multitudes by his preaching could thus speak
for himself alone. Bui whatever knowledge
arM grace was grlven to St. Paul belongs to the
church and his personal experiences is one of
hfr strongest credentials. His faith \v;i.~ as
certain as bis hope and charity.

Not Do."
preacher that opinion Is the attitude of intel
lect toward divine truth and conviction is the
attitude of the heart to the revealed modern
law. Such, however, was not the faith exer
cised by St. Paul and is not what the church
requires of her children As a river cannot
rife above its source, neither can hope nor
charity be greater than faith. Ajtain strong
conviction of the truth of the faith cannot be
called prejudice which Is a state of mind
formed without consideration or reason and is
rather an expression of inclination.
Finally, faith does not narrow but enlarges
our scope of knowledge. It is a Rift, for it
is a cir't from the author of reason himself,
and Is Intended to supplement all natural
knowledge.
SHARP CRITICISMS
OF SPIRITUALISM
Rev. W. K. Pugan of Stewart Me
morial T'niterl Freshyterian Church last
evening delivered a lively talk on "Spir
itualism" as a prelude to his sermon. He
said:
An Interest h.ie been aroused In our midst
on spiritualism through a sermon preached by
Pr. Moreland, and many comments by minis
ters of our city have been made. Dr. More
land holtls that we have thÂ»- power of com
municating with evil spirits but not with good
ones. That Idea is absurd, as It srivea the
devil more power with men than It allows God â 
to have. Other ministers argue again* t it be
cause they do not jxiss^ss the power, but that
is the silly argument of Infidelity against
Christianity and carries no weight. Another
Fays good spirit? would not want to come
back even to leave their joys behind for a few
minutes. That argument attributes to good
spirits the vicious principle of selfishness and
must droD out of Ficht; besides, heaven is
not to be looked upon bo much as a place as
a conditionâ yes, a condition which a good
spirit could carry in Its heart to the onds
of the universe. These arguments betray a
weakness of lotlc and confusion of ethics. I
think the argument against spiritualism Is
this: There Is no netd for such a communi
cation between this and the spirit world, and
Q d does not maintain useless things. In the
parable of Lazarus and the sick man there
was no need for one to rise from the dead to
teach Moses and the prophets wore enough.
When we have the life of Christ and the work
of God that tolls us all about the way of sal
vation, why morbidly pry into things God has
concealed? When every blade of grass and
every l^a-f of every tree yea, when the face
of all nature is trembling with th>> truth of
Godâ why plunge to the dark bottom of the
tomb for messages fritn tho spirit world?
Whatsoever truth there is in connection with
spiritualism is so vague and uncertain that
we are not warranted in following it, espe
cially when we have so mu<-h revelation in
the providence of <; o d. Why grope through
the dark tombs with a tallow can.llo when we
can walk the beautiful valleys of tnit' un.ler
the full blaze of the son of righto. .nsness?
I do not know whether these tiu-diumÃ can
communicate with the spirit world or not,
but let us not condemn them ty a process of
false logic and confused Ideas, but point them
to Christ, the light of both worlds.

A FORMER CHIEF OF
POLICE PASSES AWAY
THEODORE G. COCKRILL
THEODORE G. COCKRILL, Chief of Police In the early '70's and at one
time a prominent politician of this city, died yesterday morning at his
home, 1911 Broderick street. He was close upon the completion of his six
ty-fourth year, lacking but one month of that life mark.
About two weeks ago Mr. Cockrill was stricken with paralysis, and since
that time his dissolution was expected momentarily. Hemorrhage of the brain
hastened his end, which came In the early hours of Sunday morning. The
deceased was a pioneer settler in California. In 1552 he crossed the plains,
devoting the first few years of his California life to prospecting and farming!
Latterly he came to San Francisco and engaged in the liquor business on a
large scale.
In 1872 he was elected by popular voteâ as was then the customâ to the of
fice of thief of Police. His political opponent was ex-Chief Crowley, who
succeeded him in the following year. Cockrill proved a potent police director,
and his administration was one of the best experienced In the city. After the
expiration of his term of office Cockrill returned to business, but met with re
verses. After the dissolution of his firm he was connected with Van Bergen &
Co.
Mr. Cockrill stood in the first rank as a successful lodge member. The
highest honors of Masonry and Druidlsm were conferred upon him. He will

DR. WOODS DISCUSSES
THE GOSPEL OF MARK
The second lecture in a course on the
four gospels was delivered last night at
the First Baptist Church by the pastor,
Rev. E. A. Woods, D.D. In part he spoke
as follows:
Last Sunday evening I spoke of Matthew
the first gospel as written by a Hebrew, In the
language spoken by them, and that its pur
pose was to show that Jesus Christ was the
Messiah of the Old Testament. It is the gos
pel of fulfillment. Mark, the author of the
serond gospel, was not one of the twelve dis
ciples, but was one of IVter's converts, and
of him we know but little. He was the
nephew of Barnabas, and concerning him Paul
and Parnabas had a disagreement which re
sulted in their separation. Mark seenifi to have
been Peter's companion for many years, and
it is generally supposed that Mark wrote this
gospel at Peter's dictation, so that it is really
Peters gospel. It was written in Greek, and
seems to have been Intended specially for the
Romans. It bears the stamp of Peter's direct
impetuous temperament. In it many facts
about Peter are modestly omitted, while the
" Limit 01 the New Ecc/esiastic/sm /s a
Pope in Petticoats."
story of his denial of Christ is told without
excuse or mitigation. As the Romans knew
little of the Old Testament, very little refer
ence Is made to the Hebrew worship of the
prophets.
The favorite word with the Romans was
"power." They cared little as to the genealogy
or parentage of Jesus. Their great question
was: "Has he power and what has he done?"
Mark's Kospel is a biography of Christ In an
swer to the Roman question. Its Keynote is
"divine power." Mark presents our Lord to
us as the son of Qod with power, th' Lord
and Master of men. the mighty conqueror, the
destroyer of evil, the founder of an everlast
ing kingdom. It is a pospel of conflict and
of victory. The story of Christ's life Is graphic
and vivid, and In it we see the presence and
all mastering power of the Son of God.
As a prelude to this address Dr. Woods
spoke of Confucianism as the state reli
gion of China.
SAYS CHRISTIAN
SCIENCE IS NOT
GOD'S CREATION
Bishop Mbreland on
the Movement.
WOULD RHPLACE OLD FAITHS
DENIAL OF GOD'S PERSONALITY
A FATAL ERROR.
He Refers to Mrs. Eddy as a Probable
Pope in Petticoats and the
Limit of the New Ec
clesiasticism.
Rt. Rev. Bishop William H. Moreland
preached an interesting pennon on
"Christian Science" at yesterday morn
ing's services in St. Luke's Church. While
ri â c-otj7iizinÂ£ "the beautiful principles" on
which the movement ia founded. Dr.
Mnreland pointed out the errors which
have crept into it, and exhorted his hear-
era to remain steadfast in their faith to
the old church, which has stood for ages,
and not to he inveigled into a new sys
tem, which was replete with fallacies. Dr.
Mor< land began his sermon by quoting
from the Bible. "The Lord has created
medicines out of the earth, and he that is
wisi-' will not abhor them."
"The Lord has created plants, vegeta
bles and herbs," said Dr. Moreland, "and
has endowed thorn with certain curative
properties, and men skilled in chemistry
combine and apply them to the ills and
sufferings of humanity. We should put
our trust in God's mercy through sickness
and ill health, but we should not neglect
the material means he has placed at our
disposal for the recovery of health.
"One of the mistakes "of Christian Sci
ence is that its neglect of the means cre
ated by an all-wise Providence is not a
mark of faith, but rather a mark of pre
sumption and folly. We pray God to give
us our daily bread, but we do not sit idly
by until the fond is thrust in at our door.
Human effort should always go with the
power of the Almighty. "God and man
sin mid always work together.
"When the child is ill we pray God for
its restoration, and glorify Christ by the
true prayer of faith, but we do not reject
all medicine. We fchould not expect the
child to be cured by a miracle.
"The Christian Science way is not the
Christian way. . It Is a part of faith to
employ the skill of a physician and the
nurse and medicine, and in doing so we
are not guilty of any lack of faith or true
religion. It is an awful presumption for
the creature to say to God, 'You must
cure my child.' The scripture itself teach
es us to make use of the material means
and the Ix)rd himself used loaves and
fishes to feed the multitude, and the nat
ural elements, bread and wine, are util
ized In conveying his risen life to man
kind. God has dwelt providentially with
us in giving to us human agencies to ac
complish his will. He can perform mira
cles, but we should not expect miracles
when we discard ordinary means.
"I do not wish to say one harsh or un
kind word against Christian Science. I
have, a sympathetic recognition for the
truth it contains, but I cannot close my
eyes to the dangers and errors accom
panying it. There are good things in
Christian Science. Tt has undoubtedly
made cures, and on many occasions peo
ple have escaped suffering under its in
fluence, and it has restored the sense of
God to many.
"In these days, when people are ob
sorbed in making money and the mind is
almost irresistibly drawn to materialism,
there have been many efforts in opposi
tion. The materialist says there is no
spirit, but all is matter. The Christian
Scientist says there is no such thing as
matter, all is spirit. These, efforts em
phasize the spiritual realities of lite, but
they are not well balanced and cannot
last. They eventuall^ipse strength and
are split into fragmeiW. Christian Science
teaches that disorders of the body spring
out of disorders of the soul. This prin
ciple is earnestly carried out in Christian
Science, which occupies the mind with
kindness, piety and love, and only with
these can you be a well man.
"I would like to dwell on this side, but
there is another. The cures done by
Christian Science have been paralleled by
many systems of metaphysical healing.
They have been produced by the shrines
of the Roman Catholics, the Indian med
icine men, the soothsayers of the East,
the Hindoo fakirs and by all creeds and
nationalities, therefore the good of Chris
tian Science is not original with itself
As a religion, it has not Dorrowed enough
of the Christian faith to keep it alive.
"The other side tells of the harm it has
done and the dangers accompanying it
The denial of the personality of God Is a
fatal error and neutralizes all the truths
It teaches. We have been taught that God
is more than man; he is a being divine
and exalted, and the impersonal principle
of Christian Science disappoints our af
fections and robs us of our father. Chris
tian Science not only contradicts the
Christian doctrine of the Incarnation, but
denies that God is a person.
"Again, Christian Science fails to notice
the providential purpose of pain in the
world, which causes the sufferer to reign
triumphant in the strength of Jesus cru
cified. Christian Science often Inspires in
its converts an unholy sense of superior
ity, which Is assumed in the house and
among friends. Aside from the hurt It
does to character, it confuses the reason
of man to teach him there is no such
thing as pain. It urges Mrs. Eddy's
knowledge of anatomy against the under
stood laws of health. Dietary exercise is
of no consequence as compared with Ed
dy's writings at $3 a volume.
"The intention of Christian Science Is
excellent, but it is a cruel wrong to de
prive an Invalid, especially a child, of the
stored up riches of medical science which
have been accumulating like a reservoir
of mercies. Some diseases may yield to
It, but what shall we say of infectious
sickness, such as diphtheria, scarlatina,
smallpox and the like? It is an awful
responsibility to shut out the doctor with
hla remedial plans.

"The last count in the indictment
against Christian Science is that it offers
itself as a. substitute for the old church
of Christ. It is another form of secta
rianism. Instead of the old church which
has withstood the blasts of twenty cen
turies, it offers Mrs. Eddy's church, which
has Just begun its career. Instead of the
old Bible, it offers Eddy's Science and
Health, which, reading, we cannot under
stand and. understanding, we cannot
love. It offers a new hierarchy of heal
ers and readers, and the limit of the new
ecclesiasticism is a pope in petticoats.
"As a religion, Christian Science will
not do as a substitute for the Christianity
of Christ. The latfer is virgin gold and
the former .is the ore. from which we
must separate the worthless matter. Let
no one take you away from the dear old
church Trust God when illness comes
upon you, but make use of the means he
has provided, and so best deserve the
dear old name of Christians."
HE UPHOLDS
CHRISTIAN SCIENCE
An Enthusiast Takes a Fling
at Bishop Moreland.
F. W. Gale, "chief reader" of the First
Church of Christ, Scientist, while not sur
prised at the opposition of Bishop More
land to thr teachings of Christian Sci
ence, claims that all the bishop gave ut
terance to was Incorrect and not founded
on good reason.
"We have scripture., the gospel and Je
sus on our side," he said yesterday. "You
cannot cite an instance where Christ em
ployed drugs to work a cure. It was by
truth that He healed and the teaching of
it. The assertion that we are not Chris
tian in spirit is untrue. It all depends
upon what your definition of Christianity
is. We follow religiously the early teach
ings of the faith.
"Results speak for themselves. Not long
ago at a big meeting in Boston those who
were cured by Christian Science were
asked to rise. There wore 3000 present,
and a great mass rose to their feet. The
attack on the book 'Science and Health'
may be answered by an actual occurrence
at the same meeting. It was asked how
many were cured by the reading of the
book and 300 people arose. Of course the
mere purchase of the book will not effect
a cure; it is the reading of it."
India-rubber heels are to be attached
to the shoes worn by French soldiers.
It is claimed that they decrease the fa
tigue of marching.
