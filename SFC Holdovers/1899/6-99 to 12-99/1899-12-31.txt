The otiur nlxty years of Frank Cal
mel's life were replete with historic ad
ventures. He was a Frenchman, and .it
the age of 11 went Into the French revo
lution an a drummer-boy. In the. days of
Charles X The delight of his after years
was to relate his boyish adventures In
the French army.
At the age of 24 he came to America
and followed the business of trading with
the Indians, among whom he was well
known and very popular. The tall, en
ergetic young Frenchman gathered about
him a number of companions and organ
ized a company for the purpose of driv
ing bull teams to Mexico In the interest
of traffic In the wild, gay life of the
frontiersman anil cowboy ('almel pros
pered and became a leader among his fel
lows. John C. Fremont. who was then
at the head of an exploring party in Mex
ico, met him and prevailed upon him to
join the expedition. They became faiÂ»t
friends, and when, on the famous 13th of
August. 1646, General Fremont, with Com
modore Stockton, captured Monterey.
â¢ "almel was among the foremost in the
company. He remained with Fremont
until the startling discovery of IS4B In
fused the fever of gold-hunting In his
veins. Then he went forttim -Â«â¦ in
the foothills of the Sierra*- Into the
placer digging* of Mariposa County.
With the rest of the old "forty-niners"
he made and lost fortunes, sought for the
precious gold dust, and with his findings
paid for flour at $50 per sack, participated
In the swift-dealing of early lynchlng
bee Justice, and dropped into obscurity
when the fever had subsided and the gold
fame of California had given place to an
active appreciation of Its fertility in
other lines.
He went Into the charcoal dippings of
Kern County and settled down to dally
labor and quiet thinking. He was some

to a single act of unkindnes? or cruelty
on his part. He was known as
"Frenchy." and was held In high respect
by those win' knew him.
Then the misfortune of unhappy cir
cumstances came to him. His life among
the oaks of Kern was changed for that
of the monotonous prison yard, and his
comfortable rural garb for that of hid-
BOIIS convict strliu'.x. " > V
ThÂ» years drained on until he had been
an Inmate of San Quentin for eleven
year?; then one day a letter came to
him and the heart of the prisoner was
buoyed up with hope, for It was from his
old friend, General Fremont, who had
only then heard of his misfortune. The
letter brought a promise of help, and
coming from so influential a source bore
a strong hope to the" saddened and un
communicative prisoner.
Hut circumstances once more played a
- troua part In the affairs of Frank
Calmet. The letter was dated early In
July. IF9O, and on July IS, 1830. General
Fremont died, and with his death van
ished all hope for the unfortunate Calmel.
That was nine years ago. and no doubt
they have dragged a very weary length
for Frank Calmel. A stroke of paralysis
brought the final release and he now rests
In his allotted space In the criminals'
cemetery on tho lone island which has
been his home fur the last twenty years.
A short time' before the old Frenchman
died he was asked If he would like to
leave the prison. His reply was: "No,
why should I? I have plenty to cat, com
fortable bed, clean clothes every week,
all 1 want to smoke and read and kind
treatment. 11 1 were set free- to-day what
THE SUNDAY CALL.
The letters and things were out In the
woods, alongside of a neighbor's washin'
machine.
"It took us quite a while to realize we
wore a'.ivcâ and when I got to a neigh
h..r's who had escaped, an" looked Into the
mirror I found myself almost grayâ ln
three months my hair was as white aa it
lf> now. I was only nineteen, and I am
thirty-f ; j*;!t now. and I have pot no ri*cht
to sech a head of hair aa this. Y'u can
Me for yourself!"
His hat came off with a *weep. dl!Â«cloÂ»
:ni; :i closely cropped but almost perfectly
uli!t<Â» hiad of hair.
"It was the nervous strain. I suppe-so,"
he eaid, "but there Is one thing about
belrT in peril like thatâ one Is nev*r
afraid of gettln' killed; but you are aw
fully afraid of gettln' hurt. I never
thought about rettin' killed, but I was
skeered to death o1o 1 gettln' hurt and liv-
In".
"There wan *a â¢â  ;it many sliiKui.ir
things happened In that roundup, i seÂ«>
where several milk pans from a neigh

were â¢ irn i away roots and all.
"I noticed a funny thlnu about thn
waggln wheels, too. On one side <f tho
waggln the wheels appeared to have the
spokes twisted off right at the til all
around, and th* hub was perfeckly un
harmed, and the wheels on the other side
COUld I do? I have no home to go to and
I have not a friend or relative throughout
the whole world. I am SO years of age
and helpless. Life outside would offer mo
no opportunities. 1 am happy and eon*
tent."
He paused as he finished speaking, then
bunting into tears exclaimed: "No, I am
not, and I never will be until the world
knows me to he Innocent. If you write
about me say that I swear by all I hold
snored that I am Innocent. If I thought
that my Innocence was established 1 could
dlo â¢;ontent."
The old man whs led awayâ friendless
and old and 111. In the bent frame or the
Iged convict creeping about the dreary
prison grou/ids there was little to suggest
the tall, sinewy cowboy of pioneer daysâ
the robust miner of '49â or the daring
scout of the famous Fremont party: re
signed to an inevitable fate he was tran
quilly awaiting the coming of deathâ
he had not long to wait.
A few days later, while t!io sentries
were going their rounds, they saw the
old man cluing, thinking, in the sunshine,
his long: white hair over his shoulders,
and â  little later they found him lying In
sensible on the hard floor. It wa3 a
stroke of paralysis, and with the coming
of another tun the troubled soul had fled.
That was the way the life of the last
survivor of the famous Fremont expedi
tion was endedâ in loneliness, friendless
ness and disgrace. The other members
of the expedition have long slnco been
laid to rest and their graves are marked
with costly stones of more or less elab
orateness of Inscription, but the burial

"Where I had been werk'.n" I had left

perfeck circle and left it.
"The ol" musket that wo u>t to' keep

t lie lloor of the â ettln' room, and had full
possession- -the floor of the house was left,
you kii'Â»wâ only just the sides and roof
was carried off.
"There was another man on the plat
and he was saved tn â  peculiar way He
was a awful kind-hearted feller and he
was safe In thÂ« mi. hen he spied two
little Limbs a little ways off. lie run out
and grabbed them, and the next thing he
knowed, hÂ«> saÂ». the cyclone was past,
and him a hangln' onto a post set in the
ground, with one arm round the post nnd
one of the lamb* in the other. The other
lamb went to kingdom come, I reckon
He Mid th.it when the cyclone struck him
It Jest whipped him up and down that
post and everlastln'ly whalloped him. but
the post stuck fast and saved his bacon.
"I noticed, too*, afterward, that some of
the soft preen shingles that come off thÂ«>
new roof of the barn had been driven
into the bard, old seasoned rails of the
fence, nearly through thÂ« rails. The
soft wood had been hurled with sech
forre ayajnsl the hard wood that it
didn't pl:a.Â«e It at all. but drove It right In.
"There was a lot of swallows thet ust
to build their nests under the eaves of our
barn, and I guess the cyclone must a-hlt
a flock of 'em because we found a whole
bunch of 'em layln' together on the
ground dead.
"We also found a new barn down In
the end of our field, all set up In Rood
â¢nape, but we returned it to â  neighbor
thÂ«Â»t lived two miles up the road. The
cyclone bad carried it all the way without
damaKln' it a particle.
"No; none of us was killed, hut there
was plenty killed all around US, That
cyclone was a terrorâ it tore up the coun
try for â  space .if two miles wide In some
places, but averaged about a mileâ and It
never stopped still It struck Lake Michi
gan and lost Itself out In the water
"You needn't be 'fraid of exaueratln',
no matter how much you drawed on your
Imagination In wrltln" about a cycloneâ
you can't describe it too vividâ anything
thet you can Imagine Is apt to happen In
a cyclone. Maybe It wouldn't be be
lieved, but I actually saw one house
where the whole thing had been lifted up
and taken away and there was nothin'
left 'cept the cellar and sacks of potatoes
and thing? had been carried out. but
the milk pans was undisturbed and
the cream rlsin' as nice and tranquil as
could be, not even a ripple of disturbance
over the whole surface of the pans.
"Mr. ('handler, a neighbor of ourn, told
me thai when he saw the cyclone coming
he hustled the folks all Into the cellar, and
lust as he was goin" down himself the
whole top of the house went off with a
whirl. He hed Jest helped his mother-in

trap-door, and was goln' down hlsself;
he looked out through the undtr-pinnin"

circulate that possibly all might not be

the Weaver boon had a talk -vlth thÂ»Â»
"commodore." purely financial In charac
ter, but. without monetary returns, Then
Homfthlni? turned un of a rather unex
pected nature. Mr. Perceval confided to a
friend at the â iii. who In turn circulated
It among the other member^*, that at Sin
gapore h<Â« bad loaned the genial Weaver
Â£55.'. and hu.J tak*n a bottomry
bond on ihe No ma In security therefor.
This rather dampened the ardor of other
creditors who had visions of securing
their ins in the same manner, but who
now would wait until Mr. r>rceval should
collect his. For Perceval had further *tn
r.ounced that on the morrow he -was to
meet Weaver nt the ofilce of Mr. Mclvor.

long delayed cash secured by the bottom

to be something lacking, some familiar

is all over, and It Is so much easier to tell
what has happened than to prophesy what
may occur.
Mr Perceval and wife were heartbroken.
So disappointed, surprised and pained at
the actions of their former friend. Perce
val swore he would have the CM If it
cost him â  million, and wired at once to
the Westminster Hank of London for
funds, for .Mr. Perceval Is a. capitalist.
Bui before ten days hud passed states the
sailing of Weaver he became Impatient,
and raising a considerable sum on Mrs.
Perceval's Jewelry sailed for San Frun
cisco without so much as a farewell to his
Yokohama friends. Ills stay in San Fran
cisco will be remembered by the few se
lect who were entertained by him, and by
the public, who will remember the chron
icling in the daily papers of his rather
narrow escape from death by partaking
of poisonous fish in one Of the swell rotls
series. He has now gone Baal and from
there to London.
Meantime Perceval's former dearly be
loved friend the "commodore" and "als
ter-In-law" had had a most pleasant trip
to Honolulu: but upon arrival had been
shocked to Bad that Perceval had placed
the bottomry bond in the hands of Attor
ney Paul Neumann for collection and thÂ»
beautiful yacht Norna was forthwith at
tached and a guard put over her.
The people of distant Yokohama, how
ever, said very cruel things about both
Perceval and Weaver. They had learned
that the yacht Norna had been In other
ports ere this and under similar circum
stances; that Weaver and Perceval were
always together In port, but Perceval
traveled by steamer and Weaver on the
yacht. They said, moreover, that they
"had not really Intended to have that bot
tomry bond hold Weaver In Honolulu, but
the boat had been attached merely to save
it from th*> danger of .Yokohama attach
ments, and that as noon us Percivar."
Weaver & 'Co. saw the other attachments
had been bluffed off the Â£iÂ£S debt would
I.â  canceled- and the boat set free. They
further remarked -with I chuckle that
Weaver. Perceval & Co. had forpottrn
that there was no cable between San
Francisco and Honolulu and that Weaver
mlKht be obliged to remain there ;u while,
for the attorney had acted in good faith
and would makn thÂ«Â» attachment hold.
Be all that a* it may. Weaver was in

In the gentle verses of Philip Henry
Dodge ("Hawaii Fair" and Other Verses)
there Is little to attract the attention ex
cept ihe linen on KHlulanl. The memory
of that sweet and gracious girl lends thorn
true pathos:
Heard ye tho*Â»e. winds which sighed and
swept
From sea to sea. while rain tides wept?"
Though storms fling on and tempest
leaps â
Dark midnight pastâ the Princess sleeps!
Know ye the crownâ no goldsmith art*.
But forged from out â  thousand hearts
For her who midFt the change of state
Was gracious, triumphing o'er fate?
For such the world in homage keeps
A crown, alt hough the Princess sleeps.

The report of the trustee* of the. Fr*Â»Â«
Public Library for the year ending July
1. 1599. should be of Interest to all lovers
of books who are able to interpret the
-statistics of which II is composed. ThÂ«
first point of Importance to attract the
attention Is the extraordinary Increase
In the circulation of library books within
the 5-ear. For example, the bonks taken
home from the main library during the
year numbered 340.f,24, a gain over the pre
ceding year of 27 per cent. The sig
nificance of this Increase will be teen from
the fact th.it the average annual !ncre?iais
at the Bcston Public Library is not over
8 per cent. Mr. Clark, the librarian, at
tributes this Increase to the system by
which readers have acefs? to a portion of
the library c:i open shelves. But as the
branch libraries show the st'.il more ex
traordinary Increase of 32 per cent, and
M the system of epen shelves ' s not new
In them, so far an nppcara, it would seem
that some of the increase laust be due to
the fact that Ban Francicco Is waking up
to the uÂ»cfulne*Â« of the library. Or has
the floatlnu population which wna brought
hÂ«rÂ« by thÂ» war been cf a character to
Influence lhÂ« library circulation mate
rially On thÂ« whole, If ono is euessing

public.

ls*ration 1b the fact that a dollar goÂ«a
THE SUNDAY CALL.
mnrh further now than a fÂ«W yearn ago.
Five year? ajro $1 nuptained a circulation
of aliout eight books, while last year $1
dirt the same work for over thirteen books.
Some of this economy Is due to the merÂ«
fact that In llbrarlen expensr? naturally
do not frrow as fast as facilities. One or
two attendant? are nee<3ed even In a vrv
email library: hut they can serve a pretty
!ar?e one. Fixtures do not need constant
renewal. Light, heat and telephone ser
vice are likely to be pretty constant
sources of expense for a term of years.
But here again. If we pare down Mr.
Clark's figure? to the very quick. we come
upon a lire remainder to prove the ef
ficiency of his management. The state
ments that appointments Â»d promotions
are made for merit only, and that I strict
fiystem of civil service examination Is \n
force, point the way to an easy iindT
standing of the excellence Of Mr. ''lark*
work.
The city of Pan Francisco may congrat
ulate Itself that It ha 50 faithful a public
servant and â  board so wise as to appre
elate him at his true worth.
The figures of Mr. Clark's report afford
a striking exemplification of some ideas
set forth by Mr. TÂ»Â»c?rart. the llbrar'nn
of the Mechanics' Institute. The bonks
of the library number In all somewhat
over 117.000. Of this total 17.000 and some
hundreds are placed In branch libraries,
while of the 100.400 'In the main library
10.000 selected volumes are placed on open
shelves. The total home circulation of
the library is 544.000. Now of this 509 I
and more hooks that were actually taken
out of the library, /v. r BM.OOO came from
the branches, where only 17.000 hooks wore
kept. These figures include no books spe
cially sent for to the main library. They
prove that 100 .000 books supported a cir
culation of only. 340.0^0. while 17.000 selected
books In the branches supported â  circu
lation of 100.000. Nor Is this all. Of the
100,000 books in the main library. 10 M
were selected and placed on shelves. Just
how often tHese 10.000 books go and
come cannot be definitely ascertained, but
during: the month of July .17 per cent r,f
the circulation of the main library con
sisted of these books, nnd only 43 per cent
wan drawn from the flii.OOO other volnrms
on the shelve* Assuming, ns we fairly
may. that this month's experience Is not
far from the average, we shall find f'nt
the 90.000 on the closed shelves circulate
only to the extent of 147.000. that <!â¢<â¢
10.000 on the open shelves had a circulation
of 193,000 and that the 17.600 In the
branches had a circulation of 200.000 In
other words, the books in the main collec
tion went out on an average one and six
tenths times, the books on the open
shelves went out nineteen and three
tenths times and the books In thÂ«Â»
branches went out eleven times and a
fraction. Or. to look at the mntter from
another point of view, the IV per cent on
the shelves produce only T> per cent of the
circulation. If Mr. Clark were to pl.ie*
10.000 more select* d books on the accessi
ble shelves the circulation .of the books
In the main stack would probably be pf-xt
to nothing.
Now the expense of circulating "â â¢â¢
books that go out of the main stock Is by
no means ho smrtl! nÂ«< the proportionate
circulation. The J7..VV) volumes in the
branches cost about, a dollar -piece to
buy, knep and circulate At the sail rate
the 10.000 on the open shelves would eoet
JlO.Ono, and |29.750 would be left for the
mass of silent volumes on the dirk
shelves. At this- rate It costs t% cents to
take a book out of. â  branch, a little over
5 cents to take It off the open shelve*, .and
almost 21 cents to gel it out Of the main
collection.
If the reader has taken thÂ« trouble to
follow this mathematical reasoning he will
Fee that the books on the main shelves
cost more for maintenance and circula
tion than all the rest of the. library and
achieve a third as much: that they cost
proportionately to their circulation at
least two or three time-* as much: that
they go out very little, and that in fine
keeping up the circulation of the body of
books Is a weight on the library.
Does It pay, or would it be better in
select all the "live" books In the stock
as completely as possible, offer them to
the public and maintain the rest of the
library as a reference library for students
who could come to use It?
The trustees have in mind making their
library useful to scholars. Their noble
purchases of great collections which can
he Of no possible use except to scientific
and historical investigators prove this,
and prove that they have the courage to
use their money In this inconspicuous but
generous and useful way. Now a scholar
needs a whole library at Ml elbow. *rA
can work hotter In a library alcove than
at 'â !Â»* if he is given a desk ami a chair
and N provided with fair light, moderate
warmth nnd tolerable air. The ren"''"*'
mÂ«nts of the public are essentially differ
ent. They want book.** to read aloud, to
:imu.-. thÂ»m<elves with, to educate them
selves by. not to refer to. If the JO.OOO
volumes In the main stock are for schol
arly uÂ«e the expense of providing machin
ery for circulating them outside of the
library may be cut off at once, special
provisions mnrte for accommodating stu
denU and something saved for book*. It"
should not be forgotten that the books
Which go Into Kener.il circulation seidom
are fit to become part of a library of
reference. The view which looks at the
numbers of a library as representing thÂ«
accre'ion of years from purchases mads
to suit popular Interests* Is n completely
erropeoii.o one. The principle* which direct
the administration of a reference library
differ essentially from those which direct
the administration of a circulating library
for the general public. The statistics of
our public library here sugg^t the ques
tion whether the two departments should
not be sharply divided.

more quickly by way of Pretoria
and Lourenzo Marquez than by
way of the Modder River and
! Cape Town.
I olonel Baden-Powell, the
British commander at Mafektng,
seems to liavO carried out the
threat Made in his proclamation
and adopted offensive tactics by
attacking the Boer forts. The
Boers say that the fighting was
carried right up to the forts and
: that the British retired with very
heavy loss â fifty-five according
to one dispatch and 109 accord
ing to another. The Boers re
port a ridiculously small number
of casualties on their side â two
killed and seven wounded.
Another highly interesting
item of news at hand this morn
ing is that the Hamburg steamer
mdesrath has been seized by
her Majesty's ship Magicierme
in Delagoa Bay, having, it is al
leged, three German officers and
a number of men on board, who
were on the way to fight with
! the Boers against (ircat Britain.
The Bundesrath had also on
board a cargo of what is de
scribed as contraband of war and
1 has been brought to Durban for
adjudication by a prize court..
This seizure i^ regarded as
most important, not so much
from the value of the cargo,
whatever that may have been,
but from the fact that it shows
that the British authorities are
on the alert. This should have
an effect in keeping back other
craft which are bound to Dela
goa Bay on a similar errand. .
From Ladysmith comes the
i statement that General White

a native runner it requires con
firmation.
The War Office has not yet is
sued anything about either Gen
eral Gatacre's venture or General
White's reported success.
What does seem certain, how
ever, coining as .it does irom
many sources, is in the dis
patches published yesterday
morning that Dordrecht has
been reoccupied by General (iat
acre. This is regarded by mili
tary experts as a move by Gen
eral Gatacre of great strategic
value, opening up as it does
some fifty miles of country hith
erto in full possession of the
Boers.
Nothing further lias come to
hand about heavy firing in the
neighborhood of Stormberg. It
was thought that General Gat
acre might have been engaged
with the Boers. But had that
been so the War Office would
surely have had something to re
port about it by this time.
From General Buller nothing
fresh has come in. It is calcu
lated that he no\V has a force of
about 27.000 men, with sixty
one guns, not counting heavy
naval weapons.
Military experts here are in
clined to think that General Bul
ler may contrive to achieve
something important, though he
is still handicapped by want of
cavalry. It is not believed that
his selection of a time for strik
ing will be in any way affected
by the approach of Lord Rob
erts.'
Lady Sarah Wilson, the in
trepid woman war correspond

tells much of what she heard
among the Boers during her

That Wolfsohn was coming to Los Angeles in respomc
to Public Administrator Kellogg's demands thai he be identi

as he stepped from the train. Wolfsohn refuses to be inter
viewed. He says, however, that he has come here to clear up
the mystery in which his name has SO freely been used. Attor

LONDON. Dec. 30.â Is strange to note
that as the New Year dawns for Great
Britain the greatest army she has ever
put Into the Held remains passive in South
Africa, held at bay by two of the smallest
republics on the face of the â¢nrth; while
at home, in spite of the large volume of
trade and apparent prosperity, her finan
cial tercets are in a state of instability
not seen since the Baring crash. Ail
Europe is yelping at her heels and the
necessity for America's friendship Is rec
ognized on all sides. Papers and persons
that for years have been ready with a
Jibe for America* good will now no longer
make any attempt to belittle the desira
bility of securing her friendship. i
"America," says the Globe, usually hu
morous at the expense of all things trans-
Atlantic, "with a crop of 542,tÂ»M,u'JU bush
els, is especially in a position to lielp us."
ThÂ« economic shoe already begins to
pinch the military footâ not very serious
ly, but enough to suggest grave cogita
tions as to what would happen if Great
Britain were at war with a great power.
The fact that the Government has chur
tered so many transports has resulted in
a rise in tho price Of bread, while coal is
rising by leaps and bounds to famine
prices. It is euch unpleasant results as
these that â Bend the scoffer at things
American and induce such a vituperative
publication as the Saturday .Review to
say:
â¢The Americans have had their eyes
open as to the possibilities of a foreign
policy and are taking a sounder, besides
a cooler, view of the situation. They are
not. less friendly to ua than before! but
tiiu Insincere element has been eliminated
and has left a reliable substrata of good
will."
Which concatenation the Saturday Re
view under different circumstances would
doubtless have construed into damning
evidence of tho Insincerity of American
friendship.
It musi not be Inferred that this view
Is held by many of the sincere English
friends 01 America, who now point to
what they arc pleased to term its great
friendliness as proof of what they nave
always maintained.
With such a serious outlook for ' the
coming year It is hardly surprising that
articles appear under me heading, "Are
We Decadent?" and similar strains. On
the other hand, there is hull a email sec
tion "I the press and public which devoted
its energies to senselessly abusing the
Boers and phophesylng the speedy entry
of the Ilritixh into Pretoria.
Yet on the whole the organs voicing the
better class of opinion face 1900 and Its
eventualities in South Africa with an
even-minded, unhysterlcal determination
that compels admiration.
That there will be it day of reckoning
for some one is a certainty that even the
most guarded and conservative do not
try to conceal. Whether it be Lord Lans
downo. Lord Wolseley or General Buller
It is impossible to tell; but all the infor
mation obtainable at present and the gist
of criticisms point to Lord l*arisdowne
having to shoulder the onus for the ter
rible mismanagement. . vl
While Great Britain feeds contentedly
upon long special cables showing Ameri
can friendship, the Boer agents in Europe
bcllcvo sentiment in the United States
has been gradually turning Boerward un
til the time is now ripe to develop it into
material effect. Under this impression;
the' Associated Press learns, they are
contemplating dispatching a special mis
sion to the United States for the pur
pose of influencing public opinion, pos
sibly by open meetings and by personally
assisting the efforts of those In Congress
whom they believe friendly. Moreover,
they consider It advisable to offset what
they declare has been a systematic cam
paign by John Hays Hammond, the
American engineer, who was a member of
the- Johannesburg Reform Committee, to
influence Washington opinion. If the
plans now under consideration are carried
out the mission will include a very promi
nent Boer agent and a pro-Boer member
of the British Parliament who Intended
to sail this week, but wad prevented by
what Is thought to be a temporary hitch
In the arrangements. Their desire Is to
affiliate themselves with no particular
party, but. Influencing political and public
opinion, to obtain at least an offer of
mediation from the United States.: A
representative of the Associated Press has
made careful Inquiries, but failed to find
any circumstances to warrant the belief
that such an offer, however made, would
receive the slightest consideration.
The British Government Is threatened
with a coal famine, the most serious de
velopment of recent weeks. Unless the
conditions improve many Industrial con
corns depending on the coal supply may
have to suspend operations before Febru
ary, as their margin of profit Is rapidly
being wiped out. The root of the trouble
appears to be the withdrawal of so many
colliers to take\thelr places In the ranks
of the reserves.' Wages have gone up
but labor is hard to find. The normal'
Christmas congestion of traffic aggra
vates the situation, while the Government
need of fuel for transports, war vessels
and depots on the way to the Cape has
created an unprecedented demand.
Thomas Kite, the old parish clerk of

BERLIN. Dec. 30.â The South African
war overshadows everything else here.
The correspondent or the Associated Press
has Just had an interesting Interview with
the Liberal leader. Barth. who Is one
of the most steadfast friends of Great
Britain and America, but who condemns
this war. Dr. Barth said:
"At present It looks as if England
might lose the whole of South Africa. 1
have private information from Africa via
Holland, according to which the rebellious
movement among the Cape Boers has as
sumed much more - serious proportions
than the English newspaper** admit.
There never was a greater piece of politi
cal stupidity than that shown by Mr.
Chamberlain In provoking war without
having made the necessary military prep
arations, If England huu only wailed a
lew years she could have had everything
without war. li England Is totally de
feated this war will bo the best thing for
the world, even for England, it will be a
lesson she will not soon forget. It will
have a wholesome influence upon the Jin
goes of all countries, including thÂ© Ger
man.
"Our navy scheme, which is almost
sure of adoption, must.be understood to
be In connection with the war In South
Africa, all tine phrases offered in expla
nation notwithstanding. The Increase was
decided upon, because Germany has lost
confidence in the men who are shaping
England's policy. The brutality of the
present English policies renders Ger
many's position too insecure. What hap
pens in the Transvaal to-day on land may
happen to Germany, upon the sea to-mor
row. Distrust of England makes it neces
sary for Germany to be so strong at sea
that the English Jingoes will think twice
before attacking Germany. If the Eng
lish statesmen of to-day were of the type
of Gladstone and Morley we should have
no concern; but with such political Jack
o' lanterns as Mr. Chamberlain at the
helm we "don't know what to expect and
must arm for any eventuality."
The German press generally during the
last few days has expressed the opinion
that Great Britain will lose not oniy the
war but also South Africa. A military
writer in the Deutsche Tages Zeltung
fiays;
"It Is no longer a question of whether
England will subjugate the Boer repub
lics, but of whether she will lose Cape
Colony. It is true England will retain the
harbors, for they lie under the guns of
English ships, but the entire interior she
will lose, and Instead of the dreamed-of
enormous British South African empire
England will keep only a number of ports.
This probably will be the issue of the war
if England does not hurry up and con
clude p.eace."
From an excellent authority the corre
spondent of the Associated r*rr;>s hears
that Great Britain has Instructed her Min
ister at The Hague. Sir Henry Howard,
to sign the peace convention, with the res
ervation of article X. all the conference
powers having consented to such reserva
tion.
The correspondent of the Associated
Press learns In Government circles that
Germany does not believe the report that
Great Britain intends to take decisive
steps "Soon at Delagoa Bay. It in admlt
td that Germany would bo informed be
forehand of any serious steps intended,
and the reports circulated are considered

Plan of Stockton and
Sacramento Railway.
Bt*eelal PlÂ«pÂ»tch to The Call.
BTOCTCTOX. Dec 30â C. Harp, rlght-of
way man for the new Stockton and Sac
ramento Railroad, to-day made certain
ttatements regarding the' Intentions of the
company which are Important Inasmuch
as tii'-y <how an Intention to connect dl
rrct with the Santa Fe road. Mr. Harp
â aid In part:
"Our object In coining; In on North- Edl
ton street la to make a straight connec
tion with the Santa Fe Railroad, which
cornea In on South Kdlson. We can also
connect with the coal road on the same
street. Of course we have got to have
connections with other roads, the same as
any other railway must, in order to* ex
change business. Our road will be
equipped with rolling stock, but we ex
pect that Santa Fe trains will run on it
to Sacramento, and that our trains will
use the Santa Fe track to San Francisco.
If we put on a through train to Ban
Francisco from Sacramento wo will run
It to this city and then turn it over to
the Santa Fe, and they will do likewise
with us in running through trains from
the metropolis to the capital city. Of
course the business they pick up here ana
on the road to San Francisco would be
their own. and in like manner we 'would
have what business we pick up between
here and Sacramento for their train. On
thtir through buslneps we would get a
portion of Mio proceeds and vice versa.
"We ehall not have our yards on the
north side of Stockton Channel at all,
but will uce the yards of cither the Santa
Fe or coal roeds on the south side. That
means a bridge across Stockton Channel
If the Government will give its consent.
"As for the rights of way between here
and Sacramento, all but two pieces have
been secured In Sacramento County, and
wÂ« have met with no trouble in San Joa
quin. The people In Sacramento County
are taking great Interest In the road.
There will be no trouble with the pro
posed ranch road In Sacramento County
leading to the river from the main road,
as It will follow a section line.

WASHINGTON. IVc. 50.â The negotia

obtaining v common understanding for a
continued 'Vpcn door" policy throughout
China rave met with gratifying results.
The State Department la unwilling at
present to make public the nature of the
replies received, a* this Information will
be embodied In a special message to Con
greys, tut In other quarters, thoroughly
reliable and In a position to Have trust
worthy and accurate Information, it Is
learned that favorable responses have
l>ocn made by Great Britain, Germany,
France, Itussla (the Russian communica
tion comlr.g as late as yesterday) and
Japan. There la no doubt, It Is thought
here, that Italy, the remaining country
addressed, will make a favorable answer.
If it lias not already done so. The position
of Italy is felt to be assured by the fa
vorable course adopted by the four utl er
great power* of Europe.
The importance of this unanimous ver
dict by all the first-class powers of the
worldâ Great Britain. Russia. Germany,
France. lia!y and Japan, la conjunction
with tii.' United Statesâ can hardly be
overestimated, so far as it relates to t>ie
future of China und the commerce of the

Although much sea was observed In
the transmission of the British answer.
Its general purport soon became known to
the otiter European capitals, and there
was nut â  little Irritation at what was re
garded .is a precipitate response, purposo
ly de.-ij.-iu'vl to embarrass the continental
powers by khowlng Gnat Britain and tile
United States acting in concert, while tiie
rest ol the world held aloof. But the situ
ation was made much more satisfactory
to the continental powers by their deter
mination to act tor themselves. Germany
U said to have been the next power to an
swer in the affirmative. According to the
Information already referred to. me Ger
man answer was rather mere vague than
the one which had preceded it, but its sen
era] tendency wa> favorable, the only tun
...t!mi b'-inj; that any arrangement as to
tree aceeÂ«s to China should be univettai
and assented to by all or the powers.
The French answer is understood to
have come next, ar.d the circumstances
attending it were ruther peculiar and It
was not in the nature of a direct answer,
although the result was regarded a-*
most satisfactory. Secretary Hay's note
had been lorwarded to General Horace
l\>rter. thÂ«- United States Ambassador to
France, who promptly called upon M.
DcJcasse. Minister of Fortlgn Affairs
In the French Cabinet. General Porter
made known his mission, whereupon M.
Deleave showed the raopt sympathetic
spirit and stated that he had already
made ample answer to just such a com
munication, although at th<? time he had
rot Intended it as an answer to the Amer
ican note.
This answer. M. Delcasse explained.
was given In a speech made by him on
Novtmbfr 24 In the French Chamber. The
main point of that speech, in Its rcferencÂ«
to China, was that France desired the
most ample freedom of commerce. M. Del
eave referred General Porter to this
tjx-ech and told him that it fully pave the
tfcsurar.ee which the United States de
rln-d. It is said that the meeting was
gratifying on both sides and that the re
tults were considered to be a favorable
acceptance from France.
The Russian negotiations have proceed
ed less briskly, so that It seemed for a
time that Russia's attitude might not be
favorable. This was dissipated, however,
by the Russian Emhassador. Count Cas
nr.l, In the course of interviews with Sea*
retary Hay. On these occasions Count
Cassinl pointed out that a hurried answer
was by no means the best evidence of a
favorable attitude toward the American
proposition, but that Russia was proceed-
ICC with due deliberation in order to ar
rive, at some aolid ground for a perma
nent undemanding. The Russians were
desirous of weighing the many Incidental
questions Involved, puch as the effect of
the understanding on the territory known
as "fpheres of Influence" as well as on
the territory actually leased to the for

TEACHING OFTHE
CLASSICS BARRED
Report Which the Pope
Will Confirm.
Special Dlipatch to The Call.
ROME. Dec. CO.â The sacred congrega
tion of the propaganda has made Its re
port on the dispute between the heads
of the Christian Brothers in the United
States and the French superiors of the
order relative to the teaching of the
classics in the Brothers' American
schools.
After consideration of the statement of
the case submitted by Archbishop Patrick
\Y. Rlordan of San Francisco the congre
gation rul. s that the American claims to
greater latitude in teaching than li per
mitted In Europe are Inadmissible.. It is
expected that the Pope will confirm the
report at once.
Cardinal Satolll who drafted the report,
said: "Just a? â¢be Americans adhere to
their national constitution, so the Chris
tian Brothers must maintain theirs. That
constitution forbids the teaching of the
classics."
"Th* teaching of the classics In the
American schools of the Christian Broth
ers," said Superior Brother Rubenstein,
the head of the order, "was permitted for
a time, it is true, but only exceptionally.
Now the field of classical tuition is left
open as always to the Jesuits. We have
but supported the fundamental rules of
the order."

RAILWAYS MAY
CLASSIFY BATES
Attorney General Griggs'
Opinion.
ADVERSE TO THE SHIPPERS
NEW FREIGHT SCHEDULE NOT
ILLEGAL.
Chief Counsel of the Government
Holds That No Conspiracy to
Restrain Commerce Has
Been Proved.
F:Â«cial DlÂ»ratch to Th
WASHINGTON.. Dec. 20. - Attorney
General Uriggs to-day returned f.o the In
terstate Commerce Commission the trans
cript of the evidence taken at a hearing
before the commission last week in the
matter of the new freight classification,
with a view to action by the Attorney
I General under the anti-trust law, if bill
! Judgment should warrant it. In his let
ter to the commission, referring to the
demand of the shippers that legal action
against the railroads be taken, the At
torney General says:
You express no opinion on the matter, but
properly leave me to determine whether the
â  acts shown warrant me In applying (or an in
junction to restrain the operation of the new
classification, on the ground that In adopting it
th* railroad companies violated the anti-trust
law.
Discussing the methods of the railroads
in establishing a common classification,
the Attorney General says: â  Â-â 
Then* Is an official classification committee,
composed of some fourteen railroad officer*
from different section*. This committee meet*
in the call of Its chairman and upon the re
quest Of three members. At It.- meetings sug
gested chances are considered. Such changes
as the committee, with substantial unanimity,
recommends are noted by the chairman and In
corporated Into a new official classification,
which I* then submitted to each company for
It* Individual action. Some sixty railroad com
panies thus Independently pass upon the clasM
flcatlon. They signify their adoption to the
chairman, ' who, alter the official classification
has been thus adopted, flies It with the Inter
state Commerce Commission, in compliance
with the law.
Continuing Attorney General Griggs
says that the legality of the method of
preparing, adopting and filing this offi
cial classification has never before been
questioned. In fact, he says, the ques
tion of legality was not raised In this
case until after the railroad officials had
refused, during the course of the hearing
before the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion, to postpone the tlm'e for the new
classification to take effect for sixty to
ninety days. Furthermore, says the At
torney General, it is apparent from the
I protests originally filed with the commis
sion that It is the changes made, and nut
; the method of making them, which Is
1 complained of.
Taking up this question of reasonable
ness of the rates. Mr. Griggs says:
A railroad company may raise Its rates to an
[ unreasonable point: It may discriminate among
It* shippers : It may charge more for a short
than (or a lone haul; but none Of these acts,
however unjust and wrongful, amount to a
j violation of the anti-trust law. To authorize
. the Attorney CSeneral to direct an Injunction
proceeding under this law It must be shown
! that there Is a contract, combination â¢ â¢ â¢
or conspiracy In restraint of trade or commerce
nmong the several States. In the first place
there is no contract, combination or conspiracy
shown There is consultation by representative
railroad turn in committee respecting suggested
change* In classlllcatlon. There Is subsequent
Independent action by railroad companies in
the adoption of the new classification recom
mended by the committee. The testimony
taken does not show that any railroad acted
under compulsion of a combination in adopt
ing the official classification. It must be con
reded that a common classification by railroad
companies operating In the same territory is a
desirable thine. Will it be Insisted that rail
roads cannot consult respecting freight classlfl
tlon? Or, because one railroad company adopts
a certain classification another cannot? The
anti-trust law nays there must be a contract,
or combination, or conspiracy. This must be
shown. And It must he shown to restrain In
dividual action. This Is not shown In the testi
mony submitted.
Moreover, there must not only h.-> a contract,
combination or conspiracy, but It must be in
restraint of Interstate commerce. As applied
to carriers, this means a combination to sup
press competition. It Is only by suppressing
competition and arbitrarily fixing rates that
a restraint '-an be put upon interstate com
merce. The tiling of an official classlflratlon
does rot fix the rates. It i. laces articles In i
certain classes, but the rat's for the classeg
are determined by the railroad companies out
side the classification. If a railroad company
maintains the existing rates, the change of an
article from a lower to a higher class will
increase the rate, but from aught that appears
In this testimony, every railroad company
using th.Â« classification U at liberty at any
time to change the existing rates upon giving
the notice rÂ«*inilred by the Interstate commerce
act. Moreover, each railroad company Is free

SHEEHAN KOT SHORT.
The Auditor Excites Comment by
Consulting With the District
Attorney.
Considerable, excitement was created <n
official circles yesterday over a report
that Tax Collector Sheehan was short In
his accounts and that the Auditor had de
manded a settlement. Humors of custom
ary Inaccuracy were circulated around the
City Hall and the gossips waited for the
expected explosion. It did not come, how
ever, and when the explanation was offer
ed It was seen that nothing mure than an
oversight had been committed.
The i'd-x Collector had not made his set
tlement for November as the law says he
shall do. He covered his mlstaKe in lime,
however, to prevent the Auditor from
taking action against him. The Auditor
evidently was not satlstlea and consulted
the Oisixict Attorney. This conference
provoked a deal of gossip and led to the
lepurt that the Tax Collector was in ar
rears. The District Attorney demon
strated very quickly to the Auditor that
he had no cause for action and the Tax
Collector. In order to silence comment,
deposited with the Treasurer {7323. which
he had held in his own sate until his tlnal
settlement should L-e made. This settle
ment will probably be made on Wednes
day, . though the Tax Collector has un
til Friday In which to make his tinal ac
count.

requested the court to order the payment
of the hill of F. G. Fall A: Co. for bindlne
the exhibits used In the trial of Mr Cor
delia Botkln. who has been convicted of
the murder of Mrs. John P. Dunning, that
the exhibits might be taken before the Su

Cook said that he had bo Jurisdiction 10
order the payment of the bill, as the case
had passea out of the Superior Court and
he suggested that the Chief Justice of the
Supreme Court be called upon to make
the necessary order.
Theodore Kytka. who photographed the
exhibits, said If the Auditor would pass
his demand on the treasury he would
pay the bill and thereby release the ex
hibits, but the Auditor refuses to con
sider his claims until his attorney has
advised bin as to the legality thereof.
In the meantime Mrs. Botkln Is In prison,

Will Be Tried Before a

WALDECK-ROSSEAU'S REPLY
PREMATURE EXPOSURE MAY
CHANGE THE PLANS.
Is Very Confident That His Ar
rest Will Mean the Defeat
of the Government
Party.
PpeclaJ Dlnratrh to The <" a ll.
PARIS. Dec. 30.â There are persistent
reports in nationalist circles that the Gov
ernment has decided upon the arrest and
prosecution of General Merder before a
second high court Immediately. ' Accord
ing to these reports, an Important debate
respecting the conspiracy ca^es and the
charges against General Merder will take
place In the Chamber of Deputies as soon
as the session begins, and It is said the
Premier, M. Waldeek-Rosseau. will reply
to his adversaries by announcing the ar
rest of General Ifercier and his arraign
ment before the High Court. The Nation
alist organs insist that the Government
has decided on the plan, but they suggest
that it may be changed In view of Its pre
mature revelation.
General Mercier at the present moment
is a Senatorial candidate in the I^oire-
Inferieure. One of his friends who was
interviewed on the subject said the gen
eral hud resolved not to discuss the mat
ter, as he was determined not to give the
Government a weapon to use against him.
He was convinced, however, that his ar
rest would sound the defeat of the Gov
ernment candidates in the Senatorial elec
tions, while he himself was certain of
election.
I: 'â¢ expected that the trial before the
Illgr. Court will be concluded the middle
of next week, and M. Deroulede and M.
Guerln will almost certainly be convict*
although some of the other prisoners will
"probably be acquitted.
The Journal lies Debats to-night says:
"The nearer the trial draws to a conclu
sion the plainer the emptiness of the

TOO MANY JOHN
DOE WARRANTS

ARE NOW RUNNING.
Affairs of the Defunct Union Bank
Examined Into, but No In
dictments Could Be
Found.
Social Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE. Doc. 30.â The Grand Jury.
|A. Greenlnger chairman, reported to
Judge Lorigan to-day. The report, after
finding the county Institutions In pood
condition, makes Hevcral suggestions that
are sure to please the taxpayers. The
large number of John Doe warrants Issued
In Chinese cases in the Justice Courts are
condemned. This costs the county thou
sands of dollars yearly. On some occa
sions the same charges will be preferred
against the same men in the two Justices'
courts In this city and at Santa Clara. Tne
Grand Jury recommends that a stop be
put to this business.
It is recommended that an inspector at
beef and milch cattle be appointed and
the public warned against dairies and
markets selling infected milk and beef.
The county representatives in the Legis
lature are asked to work for an act pro
viding for only one Grand Jury each year,
and this at the end of the fiscal year. It
is set forth that this will effect a consid
erable saving to the taxpayer* and ac
complish the same work now being done
by two Grand Juries.
The Grand Jury recommends that no
Game Warden be appointed, and the sal
ary that would thus be expended saved.
.The quarters provided for trial Juries,
in which they re < f ten compelled to spend
a night, are condemned, and It Is suggest- I
ed that better accommodations be fur
nished.
The complaint Is made that all sorts of
gambling is allowed to run openly In Sin
Jose, and lottery tickets are openly .-sold.
The Chief of Police Is requested to sup
press these evils.
The report Is contended by every one to
be the best one a Grand Jury has ever
rendered In the county.
The Union Savings Bank failure was
thoroughly Investigated by the Grand
Jury, but not sufficient evidence of crook
edness on which to base an Indictment
could be found. The books of the Insti
tution were thoroughly Inspected and
witnesses examined, but no vital discov
eries were made. The deeding of the
bank's property to Myra B. Wright was
a subject of Inquiry.
This afternoon a new Grand Jury was
â elected. It Is as follows: K. J. Wllcox
(chairman). Valentine Koch. Thomas S!n
nott. Martin Hobln. A. C. Sterrett. A. B.
Hamilton, C. W. Howard. Milton Camp

Judgo T. origan's charge to the Jury was
a long one. He stated that In Inspecting
the various county institutions It was not
necessary to notify the BunerlntendÂ«nts.
so that chicken dinners could be prepared.
He Instructed them to Investigate the war
waging In Sixth street. Chinatown, be
tween the various factions. There are
continual shootings going on there and no
prosecutions being made. The Chln< ap
pear to be running things their own way,
and the weekly fusillade of shots ex
changed between the factions are a men
ace to public life and property. He also
asked that the actions of Justices and
Constables In Chinese cases be further
looked into. < 'Â' <

INTENSE SUFFERING
FROM DYSPEPSIA AND STOMACH
TROUBLE.
Instantly Relieved and Permanently
Cured by Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets.
A New Discovery, but Not a Patent
Medicine.
Dr. Redwell relates an Interesting ac-
count of what he considers a remarkable
case of acute stomach trouble and chronic
dyspepsia by the use of the new discov-
ery, Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets.
He says: "The patient was a man who
had suffered, to my knowledge, for years
with dyspepsia. Everything he ate seemed
to sour and create gases In the stomach.
He had pains like rheumatism In the
back, shoulder blades and limbs, fullness
and distress after eating, poor appetite
and loss of flesh; the heart became affect-
ed, causing palpitation and Eleeplesenesa
at night.
"I gave him powerful nerve tonics arid
and blood remedies, but to no purpose.
As an experiment 1 finally bought a 60-
cent package of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tab-
lets at a drug store and gave them to him.
Almost immediate relief was given, and
after he had used four boxes he was to
all appearances fully cured.
"There was no more acidity or sour.
watery risings, no bloating utter meals,
the appetite was vigorous and he has
gained between 10 and i- pounds in weignt
of eolid, healthy flesh.
"Although .Stuart - Dyspepsia Tablets
are advertised and sold In drug stores,
yet I consider them a most valuable addi-
tion to any physician's line of remedies,
as they- are perfectly harmless and can
be given to children or invalids or in any
condition of the stomach with perfect
safety, being harmless and containing
nothing but fruit Â«nd vegetable essences,
pure pepsin and Golden Seal.
"Without any Question they arc the
safest, most effective cure for Indigestion,
biliousness, constipation and all derange-
ments of the Stomach, however Flight or
severe."
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are made by
the F. A. Stuart Co. of Marshall. Mich.,

The recent report that a British naval patrol is to
be put upon the North Atlantic coast to stop and
search ships from this country that may carry goods
contraband of war may mean a guard set for quite
another purpose. We have seen in our little Spanish
war the development of entirely unforeseen results.
It led to costly and serious consequences that were
not at all intended, and would have been repudiated
in the beginning. So out of the South African war
may come military complications that were not
thought of three months ago. If the Franco-Russian
alliance still endures, and the mall spark kindled in
South Africa should light a great fire, an allied at
tack upon Canada and a plunge over the Indian bor
der would suit the joint purposes, ambitions- and plans
of France and Russia. With the peppery and volatile
French Canadians aroused in concert with such a
move the conquests of 1762 might well be undone.
The English press is watchful of these probable
moves, and the more conservative papers continually
reprehend the imprudent utterances of Mr. Cham
berlain. They say that intimations of an Anglo-
American-German alliance must be offset by a "gen
tier diplomacy" than England is in the habit of prac
ticing.
It goes without saying that a change to such a
diplomatic tone would only serve to convince France
and her ally that England is saintly because she is
sick, and it might precipitate rather than retard mat
ters.

MIGH SCHOOL WORK
THE most important address delivered to the
teachers of the State at Sacramento was by
President Wheeler on the relation of high
schools to the university.
Since the establishment of the connection between
the two. by which graduates of the accredited high
â is enter the university there has been a pro
> \e tendency to shove university work back upon
the schools. As the university can dictate the terms
upon which the preparatory ichool shall be accred
ited it has practically dictated the curriculum, which
n generally so arranged as to impair the work of
practical education to be completed in the high
school, if found to be suited and sufficient for stu
dents who do not intend to take a university course.
This policy may have been well enough when the
university needed students, but now it has too many
f<>i its facilities. President Wheeler pointed out that
in the laÂ«t ten years the attendance at the university
BCreased .150 per cent, while the income of the
institution has increased only 70 per cent. It will be
Men, therefore, that the service required for the wel
fare of the students is crippled by lack of money to
provide it, and that the State is failing in its duty.
At the same time that this incomplete service in the
university is apparent, there is no "stopping place."
as President Wheeler calls it. in the high school
course at which a student may rest, feeling that what
he has acquired up to that point is a complete and
symmetrical equipment for the work in life to which
his tastes or his necessities incline him. He must stop
short of a finished training, or he must go on through
the university work that is crowded back upon the
high school, in the certainty that when his diploma
carries him into the university he will but add to the
Rhit caused by the discrepancy between the income
the demands upon it. There is a resulting in-
H \ which adds to the ranks of the "half Lar
and deprives the State of the benefit of having
its citizens wholly and completely educated and pre
for tluir duties. As university work has been
crowded into the high schools the proper work of the
latter has been, of necessity, crowded back upon the
mar praties, and the legitimate work of these
has been forced back upon the intermediate grades,
until the whole common school system has been
turned into a siphon with no other function than pre
paring university material and passing it along. Such
tensely artificial and does not square
with pedagogic science.
It is indeed refreshing to all common school teach
er-, to students, parents and taxpayers, to hear the
president of the university declare that. "As the high
school is a course in the development of personality,
a culture course, its mission should not be to get stu
dents into the university. Colleges should accept
as who have taken a high school course, and
should arrange matters accordingly, but it is not un
dignified in colleges to teach the beginnings of
studies. Greek. German, French and other studies
mir:ht well be taught in their beginnings in colleges.
thus enabling the higher institutions of learning to
meet the high schools half way, and weed out from
their curriculum many studies unnecessary to the stu
dent who docs not intend taking a college course."
This is the most important declaration of policy and
I that has ever been made by a State university
'(-â¢nt in the United States. While the general
public, with attention dhcrted to the many issues of
life, and accustomed to accept whatever school policy
be arranged for it. may not at once appreciate
the full weight and high importance of it. all profes
sional educators, whether in the public schools or the
ge faculties, will hail it as the first sign of a
burdens. While it means much to
teachers, it means still more to the generation of
that is in the schools. When its rccomnienda
are adopted, as they must be. the common
I COttrse will again become what it was intended
to be. a culture cour-e in the fundamentals of all edu
cation which cr.n be common to all. The hectic con
ditions which have been upon the schools will pa>s
away, and a better health will fhuh through the whole
system.
Senator Hoar's resolutions are giving the imperial
!<-!- trore worry than they can stand in the holiday
n, and with one accord they arc trying to tin i
relief by declaring they are in favor of them but are
opposed to their enforcement.
THE RECIPROCITY TREATY.
WHEN the protests of Californians against the
proposed reciprocity treaty with France were
first urged at Washington they were answered
by Commissioner Kasson with the statement that the
arrangement was largely to the advantage of the
American people. According to his showing we ob
tain immense concessions from France and give com
paratively little in return.
As KaÂ«.?on negotiated the treaty and is thoroughly
familiar with it, his statement was accepted- without
question, and the only objection urged was that the
gam had been made mainly at the expense of Cali
fornia. It appeared that the Commissioner had
driven a very profitable trade for the country at large
and that his sole error tay in not taking care to pro
tect our interests as well as those of the East.
\ very di.ierent view of the treaty, however, has
been presented to the French people by the French
diplomats. They have been as eager as Mr. Kasson
!" make a record at home, and accordingly they have
claimed that the treaty is largely to the advantage of
France. In submitting it to the Chamber of Deputies
the French Government accompanied the treaty with
a statement in which it was said that only 4 per cent
â¢Â»f American products are benefited by the reciprocal
arrangements, representing a gain of $200,000 an
r'laiiy. while over 53 per cent of the French products
are benefited, these representing a gain of more than
.000 annually.
Of course we can readily understand that such a
statement is merely a part of French politics. The ad
ministration, hiving arranged the treaty, is now try
ing to convince the Deputies that it lias been clever
b 1" gel a fjooij deal for a very little. Never
theless the fact that the French can make such a good
ihowing on their *ide casts some suspicion on the ac
curacy of : figures, lie may have put some
thing of a rosy glow on t h i - treity that makes it look
brighter than it will be found when it goes into opera
tion.
Ka<;tcrn interests that are favored by the treaty arc
;,Rpered by the French claims. They maintain
that even if the French be right it is a good thing to
have the treaty. The Xew York Commercial Adver
tiser, for example, says: "If the reciprocity treaty
with France has been framed with wise regard fax
American ir-tcc^sâ and we ;.rc bound to believe this
of a treaty negotiated under the eye of the President
by mm chosen by himâ it is not against it. but in its
that it admits a larger percentage of French im
to this country than of our exports into Franco.
T!ic<;e figures are, of course, made on present trade.
If the treaty affects imports from France, which we
must take already because they are not our products.
we shall gain in cheapness and lose nothing. If it
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. SUNDAY, DECEMBER 31. 1899.
affects our products now shut out of France we shall
gain a considerable increase, and the comparative
statistics of a few years later will tell a different story."
If that view of the subject be correct â if to admit a
larger percentage of French goods into our market
than of our exports into France be commendable â
then it will be very easy to negotiate reciprocity
treaties. In the meantime it will be worth while for
the Senate to inquire into the treaty and find out
which side has the better of it. As for the worse side,
it seems to be conceded everywhere that California
gets it.
The organs of the jingo Anglo-Saxon alliance con
tinue to assert the American people sympathize with
the British in the war with the Transvaal, but just
the same one of the popular songs in New York just
now has a chorus which runs thus:
"Onward, Boers! Forward trek,
Take the Britons by the nek,
Rule Britannia! Flag and flog her,
Bull and Buller! Lag and laager!"
TrjE DEMAND fOR GOOD ROADS.
SOMETHING of cheer is to be found in the re
newed agitation for good roads now going on
in the East. The new impulse comes from the
increasing use of the automobile. Just as the bicy
clists have been strenuous advocates of improved
highways so that wheeling might be more safely and
more swiftly done, the rich who can afford automo
biles are in their turn demanding better roads, and
thus a new and important factor is added to the side
of progress.
It is pointed out that while the French are by no
means more enterprising than other people they are,
by reason of their good roads, leading the world in
the use of automobiles. According to a recent re
port on the subject there are at present something
more than 7000 registered owners of automobiles in
Europe, and of these about 5600 live in France. It is
noted, moreover, that the use of the new vehicle is
not confined to the splendid streets of Paris, for of the
total number of the machines operated in that country
less than 2000 are in the capital.
In the United States there is a considerable class
cf persons ready to adopt the automobile as soon as
proper roads are provided. It was quite the rage to
have automobile carriaÃes at Newport last season, and
it is said that forty which were there to be let as liv
ery carriages were far short of the demand. The in
crease in their use has been very marked in all of our
lr.rge cities, and it is a safe assumption the use would
be as genet al in this country as in France if the roads
were as well fitted for their use.
The activity of the automobile men has brought up
the whole subject of good roads, and once more the
campaign of education on the issue is being carried on
with all the vigor that marked it a few years ago.
Maurice E. Eldridge of the Department of Agricul
ture has been for some time past coHecting data of the
cost of hauling farm produce over American roads"
and according to a recent report the conclusion he
draws from information Riven by farmers and team
sters is that the average cost in this country for haul
ing one ton a distance of one mile is 25 cents, while in
France the average cost is said to be less than 7 cents.
It is estimated that about $.10,000,000 is expended
annually in this country in patching up and repairing
bad roads. Nearly the whole of that cost falls upon
the farmers, and there is added to it the heavier ex
pense entailed in hauling produce over the roadv It
would be worth while for farmers' institutes and sim
ilar bodies to gather statistics of the cost of hauling
and repairing roads in the different localities of the
State. In that vay our farmers would learn for them
selves what bad roads are costing them and perceive
the folly of continuing the makeshift system.
TI-jE CATHODE RAY OUTDONE.
WHEN the marvels of the cathode or X ray
were made known to the world only a few
years ago, it was believed we had reached a
degree of photographic power that would not be sur
passed for generations to come, and that for the use
of surgeons in locating foreign substances imbedded
in flesh or bone it would be of permanent value. Yet
according to reports of experiments made by Pro
fessor Barker in Philadelphia a short time ago, that
wonderful ray is about to become a back number be
cause of the potency shown by a newly discovered
element known as "radium."
The discovery of the new element is due to M. and
lime. Curie and is the result of investigations stimu
lated by the discovery of the X-ray. They were ex
perimenting in 1898 with uranium and its salts, which
exert a feeble photographic power, when they ob
served phenomena indicating the existence of an un
known factor in the mass. They at once directed
their investigations to the separation of that element
from the substances with which it was associated
and found not one but two new elements. To the first
they gave the name "polonium" and to the second
'â¢radium." The first is believed to have a radiant
power five hundredfold greater than that of uranium,
but Professor Barker estimates the efficiency of ra
dium at one hundred thousand times that of uranium.
For this reason and because of its comparative cheap
ness and simplicity the second of the Curies' discov
eries seems destined, it is said, to replace the costly
and complicated X-ray apparatus in the realm of sur
gery.
The most extraordinary characteristic of the new
element is thus described in an account of Professor
Barker's experiments by the New York Tribune:
"The practicability of deriving one form of energy
heat, light, electricity or chemical actionâ from
some other has long been recognized, but it is axiom
atic that none of them can be produced except by that
method. It is believed that the most man can do is
to transform. It is thought that he cannot, in any
true sense, create. Roentgen obtained his X-rays
only by a conversion of force previously existing in
the form of electricity. But a radiance which will
penetrate opaque bodies and act upon the chemicals
on a photographic plate is secured from radium with
out the apparent use of any known species of energy.
The phenomenon may yet be explained. But at pres
ent it looks very much like what has long been re
garded an impossibility, the spontaneous generation
of force."
The discovery of unknown elements of such mar
velous potencies at this late stage in the investigations
of science is a striking proof of how little we know
of the substances that lie around us or of the forces
that act upon them. There is no telling wlrit wide
and high uses may yet be made of radium, but it is
probable the discovery will be one of the most im
portant gifts which this century v:ill bestow for the
guidance of science in that which is to come

tions alone and directed its energies toward settling

THE PERILS OF EXPANSION
Arthur M. Wheeler
Professor Arthur M. Wheeler la at the head of the Department of History In Yale University. HÂ« hold* high
rank as a scholar and educator.
I AM an expansionist, one of what I call the "common
pense sort." J believe in the sort of expansion the United
States has h;id. It has been our policy to occupy unin
habited territory. We have grown by accretion, net
by annexation. Tht> only exception to this -wns the raid tn
Mexico, and tne onus for that affair is commonly laid at
the door of the slave barons, becaule they wished to ex
tend their â¢power.
There is a widt; difference between our traditional expansion
and that Involved in the Philippine question. I < ar.
analogy between the two. Of course, something depends on the
motive. We assigned our motive to be "humanltarianism" at
the beginning of our raid on Spain. We have now left that
platform out of sight. We justify ourselves by saying that
circumstances havi; changed. That argument will justify any
thing.
We have taken Cuba from Spain, and we say that we are
going to make that Is.and Independent. We are not going to do
anything of the kind. Our records covering three-quarters <.f
the century are fuil of instances on the case. If Cuba has left
Spain the island will fall into our hands. Cuba will never be
independent, but will be Incorporated Into United States terri
tory in some form or other.
In acquiring Cuba we have a problem before us which is
very similar to that we had in the negro question. The gist of
the Spanish trouble In Cuba Is exactly that of the whites In
the South. I do not doubt that to-day the whites in the South
would slaughter every man. woman and child rather than sub
mit to negro domination. In taking the place of Spain In Cuba
we fill the position formerly held in the South by the slave bar
ons.
I anticipate a riot of materialism, of mammonlsm and cap
italism and speculation in r'uba and Porto Rico. If we take
Cuba and Porto Rico we must govern them despotically. Thct
is the only way they can be governed by us. Our men will ?o
to Cuba as the sugar planters went to Hawaii, and. represent
ing large corporations and combinations of capital, will take
Cuba under their political control.
We have no risht to tho Philippines. The war did not give
them to us. The protocol did not give them to us. "We are
to teach the Filipinos self-government" is the latest view. Self
CALIFORNIA HAS
HARD QUESTION
TO ASK KASSON
It Will Be Put to Him
Very Soon.
â â¢ â
NEW POINT HAS DEVELOPED
â¢ â 
WHY DID THIS STATE GET NO
RECIPROCITY P
â¦
Official copies of the reciprocity treaties
negotiated by Knsson and representatives
of France and Great Britain have been
received in this city and they have been
passed around among the exporters of
California produce. The result has been
to make the business men in many con
cerns wonder more than ever what the
United States Commissioner could have
been thinking about when he discrimi
nated against California. The fact is de
veloped that this State, if it has any
share In reciprocity, has so small a one
that it is not visible. On the other hand.
It Is developed by the official text that
the â¢ grossest discrimination has been
practiced against those products which
California has been shipping abroad and
working to make a market for during a
period of years. Some of the exporters
of California dried and canned fruits are
very angry now that they have seen the
treaties, and they will prepare a com
munication that will be addressed to the
California delegation at Washington.
"Here," said a representative of a large
house yesterday, while ne hold a copy of
the French-American reciprocity treaty
In his hands. "Is proof of what we have
suspected. The list of articles upon which
France will reduce her duties if the treaty
Is adopted is as follows: Horses, butter,
lucerne and clover seed: fodder, castiron,
skins and hides prepared, boots and shoes
and parts of the same, belts and cords
and other leather manufactured for ma
chinery, dynamos, machine tools, dynamo
conductors and parts, arc lamps known
as regulars, â near, chicory roots, green
or dried; eggs, cheese, honey, porcelain,
cardboard rough in shfcts.
"Now Just cast your eyes over that
list and see if there is/Â«ny mention there
of prunes or dried fruits. Look at the list
of articles that Uncle Sam will let in at
low duties and you will pee the follow
ing articles in which California is espe
cially concerned: Nuts, prunes, olive oil,
plants and seeds.
"California is a large exporter of
prunes to France and Germany. The to
tal exports of prunes from California
tnis year will amount to about 25,000,000
pounds, which are worth to the purchaser
;> cents per pound on the average. These
are worth therefore at least $1,250,000. Not
all of them went to France, but a largo
share did.. We sell more prunes to
France than -France sells to the United
States. If there was to be a reduction
in the duties on the French prunes there
ought *Uso to have been made a
reduction In the duties put by France
upon California prunes. If the United
States Government is willing to facili
tate the . breaking in of the French to
the American market for prunes It ought
not to overlook the fact that we are also
trying to lind a better market in France.
I do not care to have my name printed,
for this is not an Individual light that
we are engaged in, but the whole State
is concerned. A petition will be pre
pared to go to Washington, nsklrc ihnt
in-- discrimination against California may
be consedered. There is â  German irÂ«ao
reported to be In formation, and also a
Russian treaty. They will also probably
be harmful to us." ; ,

presents them for whatever value they may
have as communications of general Interest.
Editor The Call 1 . Your leading editorial
of last Sunday, a bit of an editorial squlb
let on Wednesday and your editorial page
cartoons of thia morning indicate that
gome minds yet consider our heading an
open Question. The following may help
such:
Tiie question sounds absurd, does It not?
It admits but the single answer. "Of
course mnety-ninc is not one hundred â It
cannot be â no authority can muke it so."
\ei the question "Is the new year, nine
teen hundred, the last of the nineteenth
century or the first of the twentieth?" Is
exactly the same question in another
form.
Any. mind working proof, and willing to
find It, hus only to question itself thus:
Firstâ ln common, everyday counting
does the one hundredth unit belong to the
first hundred or to the second? Does It
not finish the llrst? Could we have tho
hundred without it?
Eh i ondâ lf our units are years does It In
any way alter the fact?
Thirdâ Then is it not plain that the year
ninety-nine could not have ended the first
century, but that only the last minute of
the year one hundred could have fully
completed that century?
L Ami do we not see with equal clearness
I that It needed the last second of the year
one thousand to finish the tenth centuryâ
thi very last instant of eighteen hundred
to finish the eighteenth century, and that
it will take the very lust second of De
cember n, ISM, to completely end the
nineteenth century?
Fourthâ Can an honest debtor fully dis
charge â  hundred-dollar debt with ninety
nine dollars, or cvi n with ninety-nine dol
, lars and ninety-nine cents? Or can this
I ohl world of ours fully discharge its debt
i of nineteen hundred yean to old Father
! Time with eighteen hundred and ninety â¢
i nine years, or even with eighteen huii
: dred and ninety-nine years and three hun
dr-'i ai.d sixty-four days? Those who an

the civil war we had our slave barons. We overthrew that
tnstocracy. Since the civil war thÂ» I wealth na*
arisen. This Is increasing. Observe the I'nlted -
ators worth their millions. All this tends to the absolute con
trol of the PHMfy power In politics.
Another phase of the Philippine question Is this: Whr
should we go to the Philippines for trade when nlne-tenthÂ» of
the trade of the South American nations Is with England? It
is said that the l.uropean nations are going to break up rhln.i
I do not believe It. China has existed for 4CX) years, and siM
will be right here In 4000 years more, whether England Is >r
not. The best thlnÃ for China we can do Is to stir her up. T** M
will awaken her to competition with the Western nations, and
she will drive their goods out with her cheap labor.
One of the weightiest arguments for our keeping out of the
Oriental countries is evident from the recent Parliamentary re
port, which states that fully 5o per cent of the English troops
have to be sent home infected with syphilitic diseases. Do we
wish to send our youne men to the Philippines and run the mÂ«
of a similar experlenc*?
It is hard to find out Just how the public stands on th*
question of retain. ng the Philippines because of the attitude oÂ»
the brigand press. But there Is everything against retaining
possession of the Philippines, and there is nothlnr In favor
of It.
tain that a fact Is exactly so and cannot
possibly be otherwise.
Those who will kindly take pains to con
sider the above, with other familiar illus

hardly fall to see that no other answer
is possible than that this current year
does not and cannot end this current cen

they must also see that the twentieth
century will not. as It mathematically
cannot. begin till the very first second of
the year ML
Thus the present century has yet ono
more full year to run. May yourselves

CIVILIAN'S AND MEAT-A Reader.
City. "Is It a fact that the civilians In
England eat as much meat in one week as
/he civilians of Ireland eat In six weeks?"
Is a very broad question. The correspon
dent does not seggregate the classes of
civilians: but If he refers to the upper
class it is probable that In both countries
the consumption of meat Is about equal.
In the middle classes It is probable that
those of England partake of more flesh
food than do those of Ireland, while
among the poorer classes th.-re is ri >
difference to speak of. If the correspon
dent wishes to draw a distinction between
the upper class of England and th" poorer
class of Ireland, it Is probable that ono
Individual will consume more than six
times the amount of animal food that tha
other does. This answer Is based only
on observation, as there are no statistics
on the subject.

MXJRDEREH BUCHANAN'S PLEA.
Ho Again Seeks ease From the
Insane Asylum.
ThÂ« case of Hugh Buchanan, an Inmate
of the Insane asylum at Napa. Is again
Vefore the Supreme Court. Buchanan |
3 :!Â«â¢<! a man In Yuba County and escaped
trial on â  j>lea of insanity, and he was
committed to the asylum. After remain
ing there for about four years an effort
tvas made to secure his release, his
friends claiming that ho had recoverid
):ls reason. Application was made to the
Superior Court of Napa County to have
lhe court pass upon the man's sanity, and
becaus-e a Superior Judge from Contra
Costa County was presiding on the Napa
County bench at thÂ« time proceedings
were brought In the Supreme Court to
prevent the matter from being taken up
in the lower court at all. the contention
l>c!hg that the court had no jurisdiction
t"q hear the case in the first place, and
t!:at the only one to pass upon the pa
tit Jit' 6 faulty was the physician In charge
< f the asylum. The latter was the main
â¢jo.int. and the Supreme Court decided
that the right of habeas corpus could not
be denied Â«vcn to an insane person.
Th.Â« rÂ«iÂ»ult wajj a lively contest in the
Napa .court, in which the Attorney Go.j
eral appeared to uphold the other State
â¦ilUcvr, l>r. Gardner. The court decided
that Buchanan wa? Insane and he was
ftcat l*ck to the asylum.
Yesterday Thomas A. Bell, an attorney
from Napa, made application to the Bu
prerm- Court on behalf of Buchanan for a
writ of habcats corpus, claiming that the
man. whatever might have been his condi
tion in :... past, is now sane and Is mi
lawfully restrained of his liberty. The
writ was granted and made returnable on
January 4. ut Ua. m. If the petitioner Is
successful he will bo taken back to Vuba
County ard tried for murder.
â  NAI'A. Dec. 30.â When the nevre of the
decision of the Supreme Court reached
Napa this morning It spread rapidly
cmong the residents here and seemed to
meet with jjen-ral approval. When Buch
anan was Inturnvd of the decision he was
elated nt the outcome, and expressed the
hope that he would soon be declared sane
und go back to Marysvill.Â» to stand trial
for the murder of Billy Myles. District
Attorney Ikll Hated to a Call reporter to
day ihkt he felt. whÂ«*n the case was hÂ«-ard
by thÂ»- Supreme Court, his client would
be declared sane. He further etated that
Buchanan would !>e taken to San Fran
cisco next Thursday morning. Since to
day's decision this celebrated caFe Is at
tracting more attention than ever. Mr.
!!â¢ 11 al*o ttaUd that he expected to pro
duce new witnesses In the case and pro-
Ecnt a much Kroncer ca^e than when the
matter was heard by Judge Jones tn Napa
a few wcrks ago. Dr. Gardner takes the
decision very coolly, and has nothing to
fay In regard to the Supreme Court's de
cision.

TOMMY BURNS
AND SONGER
IN TROUBLE
Both Riders Indefinitcl/ Sus-
pended â Three Favor
ites Win.
The last racing day of the year and the
clot-Ing one of the meeting at Oakland
saw a very large crowd In attendance.
Two riders win Me the new year ushered
In with their names under a cloud. Tom
my Burns, the dapper, dashing Middle
VÂ»'est favorite, kicked over the traces and
was Indellnltely suspended by the judges,
arÂ«d Songer, the Canadian drculter, finds
himself in a similar predicament. For
some reason Burns declined to ride Sly
In the last event after having made the
engagement. He was ordered to make
the weight by the club officials, but in
stead made a dramatic exist from the
Jockey room through a window, crossing
; the bay to this side. His saddle work, too,
has not pleased the Oakland judges alto
gether and It is quite evident several ap
parently hard luck rides have been
charged up to him. Bonder's work on two
or three occasions has been disappointing,
but the judges refused to specify which
rides in particular caused the ruling.
Following the usual custom, the sloppy
condition of the track was responsible for
numerous upheavals and upsets, perhaps
the most startling being the defeat of the
crack "mudder" Pat Morrissey by High
Hoe, a 12 to 1 shot. Two other favorites
were also given the long watch.
I/ec Turner, on the 7 to 1 shot San Ma
teo. captured the opening scramble In a
hard drive from Silver Tone, the favorite.
The winner beat his Held away, which ad
vantage earned for him the brackets. Beta
H was third.
Everybody on the course thought Pat
Morrissey a "cinch" for the slx-furlong
scramble following, and the 1 to 3 hung cut
was backed off the boards. Thorpe played
In hard luck from the start, managing to
be led out half a length by the outsider
High Hoe, excellently piloted by Vlttitoe.
Imperious at short odds made an "end
to end"' affair of the mile and a sixteenth
run. Einstein finished two lengths ahead
of Lost Girl for the place.
After receding in th. betting from I to
S to 2 to 1, Eddie Jones on Dr. Bernays
found It no task whatever to down his
field in the mile and a quarter free handi
cap. Driving hard. Meadowthorpe secured
the place by a couple of lengths from
Ixuhlan.
Dr. Rowell made it three straight wh.Â»n
his Morello gelding Sybaris took Dr. Bhep
pard Into camp for the seven-furlong run.
The Doctor enjoyed the honors of favorit
lnn In the ring, but was outfooted from
the start and beaten a length in l:2S\i. a
fast run. Dr. Nembula, of which much
was expected, stumbled at the start, run
ning a close third.
It was just like breaking glass balls with
a shotgun for Afamada to tuck her com
pany away to real In the concluding slx
furlong sprint. Phe ruled an 11 to 10 fa
vorite*, reaching the stand six lengths be
fore Plan. Sntsurna acted badly at the
post and. getting away poorly, was un

Overture shot up and took first and second turns before the former got In for
several oloso exchanges. As they rosn the hill the Irish dog (For Freedom) had
only slightly the best of them, and, Indeed, many thought For Freedom had

prominent Stock Exchange member. It
was $2000 at oven money. Mr. Smith, who
i- an admirer of the Irish champion, took
the Maher end.
Joe Vendlg placed $1500 on Maher at
â¢ veil mon<y with a prominent Wall-street
broker who. for business reasons, did not
wish his name mentioned.
"Honest" John Kelly, who bet Louis
Wormser $2000 against $1600 on Friday
night that Maher would win. said to

OPPOSE SIDE ENTRANCES
TO ALL GROCERY STORES
OHXmCH WORKERS TO FORM AN
ORGANIZATION.
Preliminary Meeting Will Be Held at
T. M. C. A. Hall Next Thurs
day Night.
Next Thursday evening an organization
Is to be effected at Y. M. C. A. Hall which
will have for It* object the closing of side
entrances to groceries and also the sup
pression of the dives. All the minister*
of the city will be Invited to co-operate,
and many have already expressed their
sympathy with the movement and hay*Â»
promised active support. In several of
the churches to-day references to the pro
posed reform movement will be made
from the pulpits.
The Initial gathering on Thursday even
ing will take the form of a lecture and
grand concert, and many well-known so
ciety ladies and church workers havo
promised to assist. The work Is to bo
prosecuted along lines that hare been
found to be successful In the East, al
though It Is already acknowledged that
there Is more difficult", attached to the
work here than Is encountered on the
other side of the continent.
Mrs. Seymour, of 329 Ellis street IB one
of the leaders of tho new movement, and
her statement shows that It is proposed
to conduct the campaign against sldÂ»
entrances and dives on broader lines than
have usually characterized such move
ments.
"This Is not a campaign In the Inter,
ests of prohibition." said Mrs. Seymour,
"but It is a necessary movement In thLs
city, where the grocery-saloon practice Is
rapidly growing. We are not seeking to
close saloons, for the Ran Francisco sa
loon, by comparison with other cities. is
not badly conducted. We are after tho
side entrances to grocery stores and th-Â»
dives. A saloon Is not a deceptive plac-.-;
It is *. saloon and everybody knows It,
and all who enter It do so expecting 10
drink or to be treated to a drink. If a
woman goes Into a regular saloon shÂ»
cannot claim that she did not know where
she was going. With theso grocery
saloons It Is different. Young people k>
Into them and their side entrances ar*
so concealed as to their true purpose that
they are a menace to virtue, and many
innocent people might go Into them not
knowing their nature.
"Many prominent ministers have al
ready promised to take the matter up.
and we expect to Invite the whole of
the churches In the good work. On
Thursday evening we snail enroll mem
bers, and as soon as possible we shall
organise. We are now trying to secure
a noted Chicago reformer to come here
and deliver some lectures. When we havn
reached the proper stage we shall go be
fore the Supervisors and ask for the pas*
t.Hge of the legislation necessary to per*
feet the work. 1 "

Who will succeed Colonel Freeman as
commandant at the Presidio is the all
absorbing topic In local military circles at
this time. Colonel Freeman confidently
expects to be ordered to rejoin his regi
ment, the Twenty-fourth Infantry, in the
Philippines within the next three weeks
and the general impression is that Major
Rucker, now of the Fourth Cavalry., will
step into his shoes as commandant. Major
Rucker of the Fourth and Major Rogers
of the Sixth Cavalry have applied to be.
allowed to swap commands, and as the
request will undoubtedly be granted Ma
jor Rucker will be the. senior officer at
the Presidio should the expected transfer
of several additional troops of the Sixth
Cavalry to the Presidio take place. If the
headquarters of the cavalry regiment be
transferred to this post Lieutenant Colo
nel Wint will become the post command
ant in the absence of the colonel, who is
in the Philippines, hut the headquarters
are not likely to come here Immediately.
This morning the last monthly muster of
the year at the Presidio will be held
There are approximately 1000 soldiers at
the post and they will r ke quite an at
tractive appearance.
The charters of the animal transports
Centenrial and Tartar will probably be
renewed, as there are seven hundred
horses now awaiting transportation to the
Philippines, and orders have been issued
for the immediate purchase of three hun
dred more. The Centennial recently re
turned from Honolulu, where three hun
dred horses were landed en route to the
Philippines. Captain Keeler and Veter
inary Surgeon Williamson had charge of
the horses on the trip and but two were
lost, which is considered a remarkably
good 'showing.

OVERDUE SHIPS
ARE REACHING
PORT AT LAST
Two of the Belated
Fleet Arrive.
CLIPPERTON ISLAND EXILES
SEVERAL OF THEM HOME AGAIN
ON THE BESSIE K.
Two of the overdue fleet made port yes
terday and. as predicted In The Call, both
of them had very heavy weather off the
Horn during the month of October. A
succession of north-northwest gales, ac
companied by a heavy cross sea. made It
Impossible for the vessels to make any
headway, but nevertheless both ships es
caped with but slight damage.
The Marechal de Turenne and the Ra-
Jore were two of the vessels on which the
underwriters were paying 7 per cent re
insurance. Neither ship was ever In the
slightest danger and both had uneventful
voyages, except for the heavy weather
off the Horn which every shipmaster ex
pects. Captain Panniere of the Turenne
was received with open arms by the
French colony on the front. His vessel
made the run from Swansea In 150 days, a
good average passage, while the Nor
mandle Is out 165 days, the Invermay 165
days, the Emille Galline 176 days and the
General Neumayer 179 days from the same
port. Strange to say, the Invermay, a
British bark, is the only one of the quar
tet on which no reinsurance is being of
fered. She was spoken on August 7 last
In latitude 14 north, longitude 26 west, and
is expected to make port any day now.
The Rajore also made a good passage of
ICB days from Newcastle, England. She
beats the Oodiva. which sailed the same
day, the Crown of Denmark. 178 days out,
and the Blackbraes, 210 days out from the
same port. The lattor vessel and the Ra-
Jore were in company off the Horn during
October. The Blackbraes had to put Into
Port Stanly In distress, but Captain Gar
rioch only reports that on October 23, in
latitude 57 degrees south, longitude 72 de
grees west he had a succession of head
gales from the north-northwest, accom
panied by a "fearful high cross sea." The
â hip labored a great deal and heavy seas
broke aboard constantly. The barometer
was down to 28.15 and in consequence the
Rajore was mugged down to a goose-"
winged lower topsail. Even with that
meager spread of canvas the ship made
heavy weather of It and everybody on
board was pleased when the Horn was
passed.
On December 21 the Rajore spoke the I
Godiva in latitude 34 degrees 23 minutes |
north, longitude 132 degrees 0.2 minutes
west. In consequence another of the over
due fleet is accounted for and should make
port at an early date.
Late In the afternoon the ship Peleus
from Cardiff was sighted off the heads.
She made the run in 112 days, beating the :
Australian, on which 15 per cent reinsur
ance is being offered, nearly a month and i
a half from the same port. As stated in
The Call, the majority of the overdue
Beet will reach port, but before they are
nil accounted for there will surely be one
or two disasters to chronicle.
The gasoline schooner Bessie X arrived
from ciipperton Island yesterday. She
brought up a number of passengers, but
only live tons of guano, and as that la the
article upon which the Pacific Islands
Company depends to pay its dividends the
voyage may ho considered a failure. 'I he

went down as superintend) at of the set
tlement on the Island, and his wife ac- ;
companied him. The couple have been on
the guano island for eight months, and it
is safe to say that Mrs. Holman will never
go back there again. She is a very sick
woman, and nothing but her marvel.
courage has kept her allvo until San Fran
cisco was reached. "Oh! the monotony of
the place," said she yesterday. "Nothing
but water for the eye to rest upon. The â 
Island Ik only a fringe of sand covered
rocks. In tho center Is a lagoon about
two miles long by two and a half milts
broad. The latter Is a good place to go !
sailing in. and the water is fresh but a
little brackish. During our stay of eight
months not a sail hove in sight, and day
In and day out there was nothing to do j
but eat and watch the land* crabs. The
crabs are only little bits of fellows, but I
they will live and thrive on anything ox- I
cept sulphuric acid. That kills them, but '
there Is no other known poison that seems j
to fease them. ;\
A. St. J. Oliver was the Pacific Islands i
Company's bookkeeper on Cllpperton. He \
said yesterday that William Freoth and
six Japanese and two Hawailans had been
left on the island to look after the com- â 
pany's interests. He rather enjoyed his
eight months' stay on the island. There
was boat sailing in the lagoon, surf bath
ing in the ocean and hunting the wild
fowl that come to the islands during cer
tain months of the year. The weather
was so heavy that the Bessie X could
not land her boats and in consequence j
she had to return to San Francisco with |
only five tons of guano. Another vessel j
will be sent to'Cllpporton In the spring.
The Gaelic was released from quaran
tine yesterday and went to the Mall dock.
The steerage passengers and all th^ir be
longings were fumigated, while the en
tire crew was subjected to a- risrid exam- j
ination. When the quarantine officer was
satisfied that there was no further fear
of infection he released the vessel.
The Mall Company's steamer Acapulco ;
arrived from Panama and way ports yes
terday. She brought a very heavy cargo,
the bulk of which came from New York,
and a few cabin passengers. The passage
was an uneventful one.
The transport Aztec will sail for Ma
nila with horses on January 2. while the ,
Sheridan will get away for Seattle to
load for Manila two days later. The
sailing of the Aztec has been delayed ow
ing to the bubonic plague scare In Ho
nolulu. The chances are that the steamer
Tartar will be rechartered by the Gov
ernment. There Is a great quantity of
rush freight on hand for the Philippines,
ana as a vessel of the Tartar's capacity
is required the chances are that she will
be secured by the Government for an
other trip.
The schooner Penelope had a narrow
escape from the north rocks last Friday
night. She was coming In from San Pe
dro, when the tide caught her and car
ried her down on the point. Luckily the
anchors held and yesterday morning she
got out of her dangerous predicament
and sailed Into port. The Penelope Is to
be fitted out for a whaling and trading
cruise in the Arctic.

MASSENET WILL WRITE
AN OPERA FOR "NEVADA"
Famous Diva Will Appear in It In

Manager S. 11. Priedlander of tho Cali
fornia Theater received a telegram yes
terday afternoon from Manager Charles
L. Young, who is directing Mme. Ne
vada's American tour, to the effect that
arrangements had Just been concluded by
cable whereby Massenet, the famed com
' poser, would write an opera, in which
Mm.- Nevada would create tho leading
role, the work to bo tlnished early in
March and the first presentation to be
made shortly afterward at the Grand
Opera in Paris.
The announcement that Mm". Nevada
will return to the operatic stage will be
received with the greatest of pleasure by
I her countless admirers. A number of
years have elapsed since the peerless
diva * was heard upon the operatic
stage. li has been known for some time
that should a suitable role be written it
would meet with her favor. No Informa
tion was given to Manager Friedlander
as to the character of the new work, but
judging from the famed composer's last
efforts the result will be looked- forward
! to with the greatest interest.
At the present time time. Nevada is on
a brief concert tour and last night sang in
Denver In the largest auditorium to an
unprecedented audience. In this city she
v. ill sing in two concerts, one Monday
evening, January 8, and one Wednesday
afternoon, January 10. at the California
Theater. She Is sure to renew her early
triumphs. Many, receptions have already
been arranged in her honor, one of the
most notable to.be given her by her old
classmates of the Mills College, which at
a special meeting called by the Mills Club
yesterday afternoon decided to end in
a body, and on Tuesday afternoon. Jan

Burns Refuses to Put Up for the
Fight Against the Charter and
Orders Job-Holders to
Donate.
From Colonel Daniel If. Burns to every
branch of tl><- Kan Francisco Board of
Health th<Â» ultimatum has gone forth
that if the members of that body wish to
hold their Jobs they must provide, out of
their salaries, the expenses of the legal
contest which Burns has ordered against
the charter. Notwithstanding the fact
that the members of the Health Depart
ment fmm top to bottom were appointed
for one service or another rendered Burns,
the astQtC colonel Is not willing to put
up one cent to maintain them In their
positions. The rapidly diminishing: Bums
income is being husbanded against the
expenses of the colonel's next pyrotechnic
attempt to break Into the Senate, and tn
the present case he considers his duty done
to his fupporters now that he and his
expensive attorneys have pointed out to
the health people the way in which they
think the charter may be broken.
The members of the Board of Health
| have been quick to take the tip which Mr.
Burns has handed out. It was announced
| in The Call some days ago that the board
had taken the colonel's orders In the mat
â  and tti" particular clauM
in thf constitution npon which Burns
: his hope of success was given it
that time. The Hoard oi Health was then
<)Un k to a< t upon Hums' suggestion; it
has been Quick to act in the present cane,
and yesterday every person on th- pay
rolls, whether AJmshouse, hospital* or city
office, contributed 10 per cent "f his De
t â¢ mber salary.
Those who yesterday were willing to ta'k
of the matter were re idy to nay that their
contributions were voluntary; that the as
iâ¢ nt bad been agreed upon by mu
tual consent, and thai they considered It
a Hort "i "K'-iii rai protection" rmici, to be
ii.-id in the Interests of every one con
ed; but whether it was "voluntary"
or li"t, it IS a 6SCt that when the em
- ol the department turned up at
i)i<-:r respective headquarters i" demand
their warrants they wen' banded written
notice;- tn lirint; back from the Ttons
lit. r*s office 10 per cent of their pay.
No discrimination was made; the health
ottieer as well as the Janitor was required
to make his little contribution, whether
it wnik'i a hardship or not; and In the
Df many of the men who have fam
ilies ami earn no more than Â£.'>u or $73 a
month a real hardship was worked.
The employs of th<; Receiving Hospital
division were Instructed to make their
payments to Dr. lleintz, iho city physi
cian; those .it the County Hospital gave
up t<> Dr. Hodghead. tho superintendent;
Health Officer Lawlor or Secretary Ed
Ciirroll received contributions at the main
office, and so on through all departments.
The total amount realised by the levy
footed up something over $r>oo; $r>4o, to be
exact, as the payroll for tho last month
figured up $.'.4'io and a few odd dollars
over.
The Board of Health does not propose to
battle for offio . it will
simply refuse to give way to the charter
board, and that organisation will be
I to i>< Kin the necessary proceedings.
"Possession is nine points of the law,"
sai<l Dr. Lawler jrÂ« sterday, "and we will
make no movi to establish our right to
hold office. We will let the other fellows
do the fighting and have the courts de
cide who is legally entitled to tho offices.
They will probably luinji 'iÂ»in warranto

they would serve in some position under
the new charter, but In no case was there
an Intimation of the character of the Job.
Naturally the appointment of the com

to tie a unanimity of opinion that
neither Lees. Ksola nor Wlttman will fit

thorough overhauling of the department

acres of redwood forests, containing some of the finest timber In Northern

Caleb Hobbs and David Pomeroy. The firm became one of the most success
ful and prominent M tho coast. It Is now Hobbs & Wall, a son of Caleb
Hobbs bring the present partner Over 3M men are employed in the firm's
logging camps and hundreds are given employment in its largo mill at Cres
cent City and Its factory on Beale street In San Francisco. Several large
steamers are owned by the company, engaged in hauling Its lumber.
General Wall was a passenger on the General Warren at the time of Its
wreck on thÂ»Â» Columbia River bar. He was one of a crew of nine chosen to
launch a small boat and go for aid. The undertaking was a most hazardous
one. but the nine were saved and the eighty persons on board lost their
lives. The survivors had many meetings until two years ago the last but

Fac-Simile of the White Cap Threat Received by Mr. Delanoy.
"IF I SHOULD
DIE, LAY ME
BESIDE ETHEL"
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, Dec. 30.
, A most pathetic circumstance surrounds
the death yesterday afternoon at the East
Bay Sanitorium of Miss Maud E. Hlne.
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. J. D. Hlne of
1561 West street. Yet in its sadness the
s:ory Is a pretty one of girlish friend
ships. I
Miss Hln< was suffering from peritonitis
when she was taken to the sanitorium a
few days ago and it was found, after con
sultation, that an operation was her only
hope of recovery. She was apprised of her
condition and of her danger and she
bravely submitted to the counsel of her
physicians. The thought of an operation
Beemed a very grave one to her. for but
a few months ago she had sustained the
loss of a girl friend under almost similar
circumstances. .
That friend. Miss Ethel Pratt, daughter
of Dr. Pratt of this city, and a girl her
own age. had been taken to the East Bay
Sanitorium for the removal of a tumor.
The operation was a success, but just as
, the young lady seemed to be out of dan
ger she began to sink rapidly and passed
away before tur heart-broken parents
could realize that she was even danger
ously ill.
Miss Pratt and Miss Illne were fast
friends of long standing, and when the
latter was told of her own danger yester-
I day her thoughts at once reverted to the
; other's untimely and lamented end, and
â¢in sj'"k>- of her tenderly. â¢>
"If 1 should die," she said, "under this
operation, lay me beside Ethel." She did
die, in spite of all the skill that was used
In her behalf, and will be laid to real
Monday. if not beside then very near her
chum, whose memory is still green to
â con of Borrowing friends In this city.
Miss Hlne was a clever and charming
Kirl and had a very strong desire at one
time for the stage. But after engage
ments at the Alcazar and other theaters
she found phases of the work not to her
liking and returned to her home. For the
past two years or more she has been ail
ing, and her fatal Illness was but the cul
mination of a disease that could not be
checked.
Miss Hlne leaves to mourn her, besides
her parents, two brothers, Charles and
Edward Hlne, and a sister. Mrs. Garrctt
son. She was a native of Pennsylvania,
aged but 22 years.

FRED N. DELANOY.
ALAMEDA. Dec. 30.â A strange com
munication was received by Fred N. De
lanoy this morning, and It at once called
forth a denunciatory' reply, published In
th< Alameda evening papers. which
shows that Mr. Delanoy does not Intend
to be frightened by any anonymous
threats. Koth commylcations are pub
lished above.
This threat, which Is only the latest of
a long 6erles that has been sent to Mr.
Delanoy. arrived by the first mail deliv
ery In the morning. It was contained In
an ordinary large sized business envelope
and was postmarked "San Francisco, L>i
â¢â¢emher 2fÂ». 7 p. m." It was addressed in
typewriter to "Fred N. Delanoy. Ala
meda, Cal..** and in one corner It wa*
marked, also in typewriter. "Personal
jiiid Important." It was delivered at Mr.
â y's residence. 2217 Clinton avenue,
and was opened by him when he reached
home for his noontime meal.
Insid. of. the envelope w;ts an Irregular
; of heavy drab wrapping paper, with
the threat written upon it in typewriting.
Jt was folded twice.
"This I.* not the first letter of the kind
that I have received." said Mr. Delanoy.
"hut I am going to try and make It the
hist Oiat will come here. For myself I
rare nothing, 1 " lt It worries my wife, and
a man who will not come out Into th-
open and fight but who worries women Is
â  i oward. i have never done any man a
wrong, and I am willing to face any man
who thinks that I have done so. To re
sort to^the anonymous letter style of
threats is cowardly.
"I think that 1 know the man who is
doing this, and I am going to try and
prove my suspicions and then expose hint.
Until I am thoroughly satisfied I will say
nothing, for 1 do not want to do a man
an Injustice. One of the lirst letters that
I received was written with a pen. and
I have traced the writing. 1 think. When
I am certain I shall expose the scoundrel
who frightens women and who Is not wlll

man who lives in Alameda. but does busi

arises over business differences."

ENGINEER PETERS
RESPONSIBLE EOR
TRE BIG WRECK
Superintendent Agler
Discharges Him.
â¦
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Dec. 30.
Division Superintendent Agler has final
ly located the blame for the triple rail
road wreck that occurred on First street
last Saturday night, and to-day Engineer
Peters of the switch engine was dlF
charged from the service of the Southern
Pacific Company. Mr. Peters has the
right of appeal to the general office in
San Francisco, as a case is appealed to
the Supreme Court of the State, if he so
desires.
Peters was the engineer of the switch
engine that bumped into the San Jose
freight train, that was standing on the
main line. This collision threw two care
of the freight train over upon the Ala
meda track and wrecked the Alameda
local train. This was followed by the
wreck of a second Alameda train later
In the evening, and It was held that all of 1
this was due to the fact that Peters did
not obey the signals that were given to
him and allowed his engine to crash Into
the freight.
This was one of the most disastrous
wrecks that have occurred on the lines of
the Southern Pacific Company for dam
age to the property of the company, but
without loss of life. V -
A wreck occurred near Crockett, on the
Port Costa line of the Southern Pacific
Company's system, when a freight train
. -'Ââ â â â ; -:â â â  â 
crashed Into a landslide. Engine 1675 and
four freight cars were ditched, and traf
fic on this line was delayed for several
hours until the track could be cleared.
Engineer Skinner and Fireman Orr were
in charge of the engine and had a narrow
escape from death.
This is simply one of the many wrecks
that can b,e traced to the bicycle method
of track-walking, for the track Inspection
crew" failed to discover the slide in time
to prevent the wreck, and a considerable
loss of property, Inconvenience to travel
and danger to life resulted.
WEDDED AFTER
II COURTSHIP
OE ONE WEEK
Miss Rix Marries an
Alaska Millionaire.
IRVINGTON. Dec. 30.â Miss Julia E.
Rix of this place was married to Theodore
B. Straven of Dawson City on Christmas
after a remarkably short courtship of one
week.
Miss Rlx is one of the best known young
ladies In Washington Township. She is
the daughter of A. O. Rix of this place,
a pioneer, and one of the large property

any one In this section, but she gave her
self to a. man from the mysterious, gold
sown districts of Alaska after an ac
quaintance of but seven days.
Mr. Straven arrived in Irvington a week
before Christmas and was introduced to
Miss Rix. It was literally a case of love
at tirst sight, for on Christmas day they
were wed at the home (if the bride's
father and they left that afternoon for
L<<B Angeles, where they will spend their
honeymoon. Straven is said to be worth
a gnat d(;il of money in Alaska mines,
but is comparatively unknown here.

POLICE PLAY
CRAPS IN A
COURTROOM
Captain Petersen Ex
plains the Game.
Oakland Offlce San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway. Dec. 30.
Interest In the trial of Thomas Deacon
for gambling centered last night in a
theatrical illustration by Police Captain
PttATMll of the mysteries of "craps." Pet
ersen is a versatile young man and when
he took the stand to testify Prosecuting
Attorney Hynes decided that, in order |
that the Jury might become familiar with
the game, the witness should give an ex
hibition of how it was played. The cap
tain therefore went to a crap table, which
had been brought into court as evidence,
and while Judge, Jury, attorneys and
spectators gathered around the table and
watched with undisguised interest he
went through the ra&Ume contortions of
the game in a way that would have ex
cited the envy of a professional.
The trial of the case has consumed two
days and evenings. The first day was
given over to the selection of a Jury of
â even men to try the case, and last even
ing, although court was held by Police
Judgo Smith from 7:30 till 9 o'clock, only
iwn wIIBBiiM were examined. To-day the
third witness testified and the arguments
wi'iv made, and to-night the case was
given to the Jury. During the trial there
were trequent talks between Attorney!
Frick and Church on one side and Prose
cuting Attorney Hynes on the other, and
several times Judge Frlck attacked the
witnesses, attempting to show that they
had acted without authority in making
the am-st.
Deacon was arrested on December 17 In
a raid on Rosenberg's saloon on Hrnad
way. The raid was made by Police Cap
tain Petersen, Sergeant McKlnley and
Patrolman Pardee, who were the only
witnesses placed on the stand. They tes
tified to having on several occasions
watched a game which was being run In
a rear room of the saloon, from a skylight
on the roof. As the skylight was f rusted
they had to cut a hole in a tin ventilator.
On the night of the arrest they saw the
game in full blast and. descending to the
street, demanded entrance at tho front
door. "When they were finally admitted
they claim the table had been thrown
against tho wall and covered and the
players were in another room. They were
all. however, placed under arrest.
Thfl defense did not nut on any wit-
DSSS6S, its attorneys relying upon their
arguments to secure an acquittal. Every
point in the case was hotly contested and
the arguments were not completed till late
this evening. At 8 o'clock Judge Smith
charged the Jury.
After being out an hour and a half the
Jury returned a verdict of guilty. Sen
tence will be imposed Tuesday.

but it was not until the third trial that
he wus convicted. While in Jail awaiting
an appeal without ball he developed con
sumption, and upon medical testimony

VETERANS ARE SATISFIED.
Charges of Discrimination Against
Them at Mare Island Are
' Denied.
The veterans employed at Marc Island
take strong exceptions to the statements
made at the meeting or the veterans of
the Civil War Association, held at 123
Eddy street Thursday night, to the effect
that the veterans employed at the navy
yard are being discriminated against by
Lieutenant Halllday in pursuance of the
policy of the present administration. Mr.
Runner, who has been employed at the
navy yard for the past three years, vis
ited The Call office last night and an
nounced that he had been delegated by
the veterans of Mar.' island to correct
the impression which he declares is
sought to be created by President Mar
tin of the association and others, solely
for political effect and to injure the ad
ministration.
"There is absolutely no truth In the
charge that the veterans at the navy
yard are being discriminated against,
said Mr. Buttner. "Eight out of every
ten men employed there are veterans and
they have no complaints to make. The
story was made out of whole cloth and
we repudiate It entirely."

close of the year to mnke quite an active
market and Borne Irregularity In prices. The
Baltimore and Ohio stocks after their upward
leap of yesterday were conspicuously affected,
the common falling back nearly "', and the
preferred over a point. The most active of
the specialties. Including Sugar, the Tobacco*
I and the New York City traction stocks were
also inclined to react, although the undertone
was strong and there was a disposition to
hold stocks for the expected demand after the
first of the year. The expectations of this de
mand Is based on the mi i â :. n relapse in the
money rates at all the leading financial cen
ters, the IÂ»ndon discount rate falling below
the bank rate to-day and the IJerlln rate show-
I Ing a further decline. This rives ground for
! hope that the export movement of gold will
be brought to a stop. It Is possible, however,
that the relaxation In foreign money rates
may be based on expectations of further sup
] plies of gold from this country. That being
i the case bankers believe there may be recur
j rences of money stiffness In January- The
1 day's trading demonstrated that the level of
j prices still offers Inducements for Investment
I buying. The sales of small lots of less than
] ICO shares continued even more conspicuous
than on recent days. All grades of stocks
were embraced In this demand down t.i the
nnn-<Jlvld<rnd paying stocks with only remote
prospects of return. The prevailing sentiment
on the exchange was decidedly bullish. The
constant striving of the financial world to an
ticipate events is responsible for the paradox
of a lively recovery In prices of securities and
easy money condition* In the last week of the
year. This tendency of the financial world
Is responsible for the week's event in a two
fold sense. Last week's panic conditions were
the results of preparation for the money pinch
which has long been looked for at the close
of the year owing to the extraordinary mag
nitude of the January l disbursements this
I year. Last' week's forced liquidation overdid
| ltsrlf, as such violent movements are certain
to do. and Wall street found Itself unex
i pectedly flush of funds with prices of securi
ties at the lowest level of the year and a
practically universal conviction that the, be
ginning Of the new year will mark a period
of easier money with the regular reflux of
funds from active use in business to the â 
world's financial centers. The speculative
world therefore executed an abrupt about face
and rushed to buy stock* to anticipate the
good times supposed to be coming with the
new year. The demand was particularly urg
ent from the short interest, which had over
extended itself last week, and worked some
violent recoveries In stock* which had suffered
most severely from last week's panic For
Instance Metropolitan Street Railway, which
closed on Saturday, December 23, at 167, sold
in the panic at US and rallied this week to
17SV4. which, allowing for the dividend de
ducted. is equivalent to over ISO. In fact the
general level of prices has recovered to about
that of the Saturday before the panic. From
the speculative standpoint doubts have arisen
whether the violence of this recovery was not
excessive and there has been realizing by hold
ers, who bought In the panic either to sustain
price* or In â  hunt for bargains and renewed
rhort wiling at the recovered high level.
The following table will give an Idea of the
vlolen.-e of the speculative movement In the
stock market during the past year and will
account for the wide vibrations of the last
two weeks In the attempts to find the equilib
rium of the true values. Tnose stocks have been
selected In which 11." variations have been
widest, but generally speaking they are also
those In which transactions have been largest,
â a that they are fairly representative of the
market.
In the column headed "About January 3"

Associated Banks' Statement.
NEW YORK. Dec. 30.â The Financier say*:
| The statement of the New York Clearing-house
banks for the week ending December 30 shows
I a further decline of $754.000 in the surplus re
serve, the total now standing nt 111. 168,075. As
was the cane during the previous wevk all the
1 cash sained by the hanks went to swell the
I excess reserve, since deposit requirements were
lessened by the shrinkage In that Item. The
statement Is favorable and Indicates that the
Influx of funds from the interior In the past
â Ix days has been quite as heavy as has been
estimated. The* loss of gold to Europe by Sat
urday's steamer does not count In the current
exhibit, but the exports of a week ago figure
to the full extent. The outward flow, therefore,
has been almost made up by subsequent receipts
and the (tain In legal tenders represents the
surplus shipments from the Interior. The banks
have maintained their position so far as cash
is concerned, but they have added little to their
loaning capacity. If the experience of January
last year Is a criterion heavy receipts for the
next few weeks may be expected from domestic
centers, with the difference that whereas last
winter the New York banks retained all the
money that waa forwarded they must now
provide for the demands that i:urope Is now
maklnc tor American gold. Still the present
arrangements with the Treasury are such that
there will be no further drain of domestic funds
Into Government vaults, mi operation that
takes money out of u*e even more effectively
than cold exports. The continuance of the
prerent movement Is Important In thut It de
termines the ext.-tit to which thf banks can
expand their loaiis, and, above that, the rate.l
which they will obtain on them. As the same
factors incident to the transfer of funds which
mark the January period in the United States
are operative abroad conservative bankers are
flruiinc that the n-turn flow of monÂ»y from
various centers Into the great foreign banks
will tend to make rates easier abroad and
u.T. t enhance quotations to the point of stop
pinK nporta of nM froa \>w York. \r huh
Is tÂ»".e case the hanks here will IHOlMtllj r.-
cuperate the!r reiiour'---s. or at lea.<t tli-y will
be In a po?ltifn t<> expand their commltatatii
As It Im loans are now almost stationary
while depot-Its are belnjj reduced. No one looks,
however, for the burst of expansion thai
marked the opening of the great rise In specu
lative prices In January last.

Mind. I
If you have "a good mind to
write to Dr. Pierce" take pen in

avoid the experience of Mrs. M. P.
Davis, of Honaker, Russell Co.,
Va. She writes :
"For seven years I was confined to
bed most of the time. I had ulceration
of internal organs and female weakness.
I had four doctors and they said I could
not be cured After the doctors said
I could not be cured I wrote to Doctor
Pierce for advice I followed the
advice he gave. I feel better than I
ever did. My friends say Ido not look
like the same woman, lam sorry I did
not take Dr. Pierces medicine when I
first began to have poor health. I could
have saved what I paid to humbugs."
No one ever regretted writing to
Dr. Pierce for advice. Many have
regretted not writing sooner.
Sick women are invited to con-
sult Dr. Pierce by letter, /re:, and
so obtain the opinion and advice of

HE MOCKED HER
AS THE POISON
MADE HER ILL
Laura W. Grossman's
Divorce Suit.
SENSATIONAL CHARGES MADE
MINNIE E. TALMADGE SAYS SHE
WAS CRUELLY ABUSED.
â¦
Husband Refuses to Take Her to His
Horne â Several Unhappy Cou
ples Will Find Relief in
the Courts.
Dr. Edward L. Grossman, whose offices
are at 410 Kearny street, has been made
the defendant In a sensational suit for
divorce filed by his wife. L.u.ira W. Gross
man, who resides, with her son. Carl
Spencer Grossman, at 244 Oak street. Mrs.
Grossman's complaint teems with allega
tions of extreme cruelty and it is alleged
that the physician beran his abuse- before
the honeymoon had waned.
By way of introduction Mrs. Grossman
says that she married her husband Sep
tember 1, 1896. Before tHe end of the
month he warned her to keep away from
his offices and then left his home, re
maining: away for three days. Finally he
refused to supply the home with food or
pay the rent and concluded a vitriolic at
tack by taking his trunk and remaining
away from the home for some time.
Later, continues Mrs. Grossman, her hus
band returned and found her ill. lie .id
ministered a large dose of morphine and
when the complainant made known her
sufferings from Its effects he laughed and
Jeered at her and warned her to be quiet
as she disturbed his sleep. Again he ac
cused her of unfaithfulness, charged her
with soliciting on the streets after night
fall and then threatened to blow out her
brains.
At another time Mrs. Grossman alleges
her husband refused to furnish her with
supplies and then abused her for failing
to have his meals ready when he returned
home. She concludes her complaint by
alleging that she can no longer suffer his
cruelty and she prays for a divorce, ali

ORDERED HIS MOTHER
TAKEN TO THE MORGUE
STRANGE REQUEST OF RICHARD
DONOHUE.
Did Not Want the Body to Remain
in His House and Could Not
Afford the Funeral.
An Instance of heartlessness bordering
upon brutality was noted yesterday by
Coroner Hill In the case of the death of
Mrs. Mary Donohue from natural causes.
Mrs. Donohue was 72 years old and lived
with her son. Richard Donohue. a shoe
maker at 4912 Nineteenth street. Accord
ing to the statement of the Coroner. Don
ohue called up the Coroner's office by tel
ephone yesterday and asked that the
Morgue wagon be. sent to take the body
of his mother to tht- Morgue, an he did
not desire to have it In the nouse and was
not able to pay for the burial. The Coro
ner's deputies Informed him that as It
was a natural cause case the matter was
not within the province of the Coroner,
and that he should apply to the Hoard of
Health to have his mother's body Interred
by the, city undertaker in the potter's
field.
Donohue, according to the statement of
the Coroner and his deputies, replied that
he did not care about bothering with the
Board of Health and that the Coroner
should take charge of the remains. When
the Morgue wagon reached the residence-
Deputy Coroner Gately was Informed that
Richard Donohue was not at home and
that the old lady had died of natural
causes. Deputy Gately thereupon declined
to take charge of the body and notified
the health officer of the facts as learned
by him.
