GREAT DREYFUS DRAMA
MERCER'S CHARGE OF
BRIBERY TO AID DREYFUS
Statements of the Discredited General May Cause
the Court-Martial to Be Lost to View and
Create Diplomatic Difficulties.
PARIS. Aup. 14.â 1t looks as though
Dreyfus were In danger of being
lost to view in the Incidents created
by General Mercier's evidence on Satr
urday before the court-martial at
Rennes. Perhaps It would be more
correct to say Mereier's speech, for he
produced but little of anything' ex
cept hearsay twaddle, which one would
be ashamed to have dismissed a ser
vant upon. He harps on Captain Le
brun-Renaud's apocryphal declaration
that Dreyfus admitted hip guilt, as
though the Court of Cassation had not
pricked that bubble. After all. why
should Dreyfus confess?
What, indeed, was the use o-f a con
fession when as many proofs as were
necessary could be forced as fa.st as
they were required? Another detail
of General Mereier's lecture which
seems likely to give him as much
.trouble as he can handle is the state
that M. de Freycinet told General
Jamont, who told Mercier. that England
and Germany alone had subscribed
thirty-five millions to buy off Dreyfus.
The great thing: about all the witnesses
In this too infamous affair is that every
one of them tells about what some one
told a friend <>f his that he had
heard from some myterious personage,
whom it would provoke a foreign war
to even name. In the preseni
ly, the matter of thirty-five mil
lions. M. de Freycinet is for a wonder
.given as the source of the declaration,
has been called to appear, though
the affair, even if true, hap to do
with the guilt or innocence of Dreyfus
is hard to fay. If a hundred millions
have been subscribed by the lovers of
Justice and humanity to defend Dreyfus
it will only prove that there Is rather
philanthropy in the world than ,
â¢ are inclined to believe, but it j
certainly convince any man)
with a grain of common sense that â 
Dreyfus ha? written the fncrirniriating
document which Esterhazy admits he
wrote. The only importance attaching
to the thirty-five million idiocy is that
it was uttered by General Mercier, not
â  3i me journalistic sensation monger.
M. .-Comely devotes his article in the
Figaro to-day to this matter. He is

M. 1': -menceau's irony in the last '
phrase will be appreciated by all save
possibly Generals Mercier and Jamont
i and M. de Freycinet, who will writhe" at
i the more idea that they care anything
: about the truth or its interests. The
object of General Mercier's accusation
\ that a syndicate has bought all Drey
fus* defenders is manifestly to create
the belief that an attempt will be made
,to substitute Esterhazy for Dreyfup.
i He does not say so in so many words.
I but he allows it to be clearly seen that
this is to bo regarded as a clew to the
determination to have the case revised.
As M. Clemenceau remarks, he main
tains that Dreyfus wrote the bordnrau.
By this means he insinuates that the
syndicate bribed Esterhazy to make
! him confess that he wrote it, just as it
.bribed the press and Court of Cassa
i tion and all those who demanded jus
' tice and law.
The lunacy of such proceedings is evi
dent when one remembers that although
Esterhazy owns to having written
the bordereau, he strenuously denies
that he did it with criminal intent. It
' â  ; was done by order, he says, so that
' definite evidence might be at hand to
produce against Dreyfus, who. "so
Esterhazy declares, is a traitor, and had
delivered all sorts of important infor
-1 : mation to Germany and Italy. Now the
syndicate must be composed of abso
lute idiots, or else they would have
bribed Esterhazy to own to being a
traitor while he was about it. It would
not have damaged Esterhazy's reputa
tion, or what passes with him for such,
had he taken the last step, telling the
â  truth and exculpating Dreyfus com

lished by th^ mile by anti-revisionists
papers for the last two years. M. Clem
enceau is probably right In saying that
M. do Freycinet will hardly authorize
Mercier to put the responsibility for
the thirty-five millions invention upon
his shoulders.
As for M. I'aul de Cassagnac, he is
more savage than usual in his remarks
I about General Mercier's frivolity in
sending Dreyfus for trial when he had
nothing more serious against hin than
what he has produced. He says: "The
general does not even appear as a wit
ness, but as a very feeble counsel for
the prosecution. It is alsu likely that
Mercier's eagerness to incriminate the
! German Emperor will create diplomatic
difficulties, though some of the German
papers do say that General Mercier's
evidence Is more a pathological matter
than anything else."
ARRESTS WERE DUE
TO A VAST PLOT
PARIS, Aug. 14.â Slight demonstra
! tions have occurred here this evening,
j but there was no disorder.
The immediate cause of Saturday's
arrests was a police discovery of trea
sonable correspondence in France and
Belgium, revealing an intention to call
a great meeting of Royalists, Nation
alists and anti-Semites to plan meas
ures for the overthrow of the republic.
The idea wan to create disturbances
that would necessitate calling out the
troops, who would have fraternized, so
th>- scheme contemplated, with the con
â ; spirators. Then rushes were to be
made on the Elysee palace and the
Government .offices. Finally a Minis
ter of War named by the Duke of Or
leans v.ns to have replaced Marquis de
Gallifet.
It is impossible to verify thes<
tails, but it is believed that matters
were on the eve of becoming st-rious
and that the attempt uj">n the life of-
Labori was connected witn the plot.
This afternoon a fresh warrant was
issued for the arrest of M. Guerln. Ac
cording to a French statute, his effort
! to evade arrest for a political crime is
punishable with penal servitude.
A strong police force now gtiards the
office of the Anti-Semite League, where
a crowd numbering thousands com
pletely blocks the traffic Windows In
the vicinity are all filled with people
anticipating the storming of th<? build
ing. Shopkeepers near by have i
their shutters.
Whil" a general officer in uniform
was riding along the street the crowd

'"Vive l'Armee" and "Mort aux Juifs."
M. GUERIN YET
BLUFFS THE POLICE
PARIS, Aug. 15. â The assistant chief of
detectives at 4:20 this morning went to the
house of M. Guerin, president of the Anti-
Semite League, with a warrant for his
arrest. He rang the bell several times,
and finally M. Guerin appeared at the
window but refused to oncn the door,
saying: "If you want me come and take
me."
Thereupon the 'detective withdrew. M.
Guerin calling after him: "You want to
fight? Well, we will light. Permit me to
tell you you're doing very dirty business."
Then, turning to his friends, he ex
claimed loudly: "Come, come, comrades,
let us die. They will only take me dead."
Some of the spectators of the scene
shouted, "Vive le i ruerin I"

Papers.
PARIS, Aug. 14.â Figaro cor
respondent at Rennes telegraphs
that three men took part in the
attack on M. Labori.
When M. Labori fell and M.
Cast and Colonel Picquart started in
pursuit of the criminal, two accom
plices seized M. Labori's leather port
folio and appropriated among other
papers a letter from M. Clemenceau to
M. Jaures, and a letter from M. Joseph
Reinach to M. Labori. It is therefore
considered that the attack was pre
meditated.
A bargeman working near the scene,
who saw the attack, declares that he
had seen the criminal hanging: about
for several days, evidently waiting for
M. Labori.
The excitement at Rennes is tremen
dous and the emotion has spread even
to the smallest villages.
It is said that the last anonymous
letter received by M. Labori contained
the fallowing: "We're going to burn
your box and your Dreyfus dossier."
RBNNES, Aug. 14, 11 p. m.â fol
lowing bulletin regarding the condition
of M. Labori was issued at 10 o'clock:
â¢Temperature 37.05. No fever. Condi

There has been, therefore, a slight
improvement during the last few hours.
M. Labori' a mother arrived here this
evening. She had believed him dead
and a most affecting interview ensued.
Later M. Labori received Mathieu
Dreyfus, brother of Captain Dreyfus.
There is some talk of M. Albert Clem
enceau, the younger of the two broth
ers, gaming as a substitute for M.
Labori.- The question, however, will
be definitely decided to-morrow.
M. Clemenceau ' was one of j Zola's
counsel at his trial, and has fol
lowed the Dreyfus affair very closely.
While he lacks the magnetic influence
of Labori in pleading, he is extremely
skillful in cross-examination.

MANY SENSATIONS AT
THE RENNES COURT-MARTIAL
Former Ministers of War of France Trying Hard
to Cause Dreyfus to Be Again Found
Guilty of Treason*
RBNNES, France, Aug. 14.â
shooting of M. Labori, leading
counsel for Dreyfus, robbed the
morning session of the Dreyfus
court-martial of its paramount
Interest. The murderer apparently
chose to-day for the attempt because
it was anticipated that M.' Labor!
would crush General Mercier, the for
mer Minister of War, with his cross
questioning.
The news of the shooting of M. Labori
caused an immense sensation in the
courtroom, where the usual audience
had assembled awaiting the coming of
the Judges. M. Labori's absence had
just been announced when suddenly M.
Jaunay, syndic of the judiciary press,
rushed into the room and shouted: "M.
Labori has been shot!"
All present gave a gasp of horror and
surprise, and every man jumped to his
feet and a volley of questions was
hurled at M. Jaunay's head, who, cry
ing "That is all I know," rushed out of
court again, followed by a number of
his hearers. Those who remained ex
citedly discussed the crime and vigor
ously denounced the authors.
Colonel Jouaust, president of the
court, when the news reached him, sus
pended court until 7:15 a, m. It appears
that Mme. Labori herself broke the
news to the court and informed M.
Jaunay of the crime, having rushed
from her husband's side crying for a
doctor and shouting that her husband
bad been shot.
There was an eager struggle for seats
in court to-day and 640 were seated.
There were the usual military honors.
Immediately after the prisoner arrived
the president announced that in conse
quence of the applause and other ex
pressions of opinion on Saturday he has
decided that if there was any further
interruption the court would be cleared.
During the adjournment of the court
in consequence of the announcement of
the attempt oh the life of M. Labori
the audience engaged in violent alter
cations over the incident.
-M. Mercier, editor of the Gaulois, ex
pressed the opinion that all- the news
papers, ought to regard themselves as
responsible for the outrage, whereupon
.M. Savarrine loudly protested, saying:
"No, it is you who ought to be held
responsible for what has happened."
The clamor finally became so violent
that gendarmes were forced to separate
| the combatants and take away the
sticks of all those present, but calm
was finally restored, and the session
was resumed. .."'.â -
When the court-martial was resumed
General Mercier was confronted with M.
Casimir-Perier, the former President of
France. The latter declared that M. Mer
cier's story, told on the witness stand Sat
urday, of the imminence of war between
Germany and France in 1894 was grossly
exaggerated, and complained of the action
of the Minister of War (Mercier) in mov
ing 60.000 troops to the frontier without
consulting him. As it was M. Labon's
task to take General Mercler in hand, and
M. Demange, associate counsel, was quite
unprepared for the task, the few ques
tions the latter put were practically of
little effect, and Genera) Mercier escaped
cheaply. Moreover, M. Demange was
deeply affected by the attempt to assas
sinate his colleague, and was quite un
able to do himself justice.
General Mereier was recalled, and in re
ply to the president of the court he-reit
erated his belief that Major Count Ester
hazy, in spite of the latter's own decla
ration, was not the .author of theâ¢bor
dereau, which the witness claimed was
written on tracing paper and was found
in an embassy.
'1 ne president asked M. Casimir-Perler
to explain the circumstances of the con- ;
fession Dreyfus is alleged to have made
to Captain Lebrun-Re-naud.
M. Casimir-Perier persisted in his state
ment of Saturday that he had never re
ceived any confidences of this character
from Captain l,ebrnn-Renaud. He add
ed that M. Dupuy, the' then Premier, was
present when Captain Lebrun-Renaud
called at the Elysee Palace. .
"Moreover." said M. Casimir-Perier.
"here is a letter from M. Dupuy which I
ask may be read."
The letter asserted that- Captain Le
brun-Renaud. when questioned by M. Du
puy. replied that General Merrier had sent |
him to the President to receive a dressing j
down for his indiscreet disclosures to the
Figaro.
General Merrier here interposed, say
ing: "Captain Lebrun-Renaud spoke to
me in regard to the confessions in the
presence of General Gonse, who will tes
tify thereto. It was then that I ordered
him to go to the President of the repub
lic "
Referring to General Mercier's declara
tion on Saturday last on the witness
stand M. Casimir-Perier said:
"General Mercier had no right what
ever to intervene in a diplomatic conver
sation. I would have prevented such in
terference. It was I alone who conferred
with the Minister, and I declare the im
pression I derived from the conversation
was one of complete calm: otherwise the :
incident would not have been closed by
the framing of a note. We had no tele
gram from Berlin that evening. It was
in regard to the note the Minister referred
to Berlin. If there had been any news in
regard to the matter on the evening of
the nth we would not have waited until
the 3th to publish the matter. There was
no dispatch addressed to the friendly pow
ers relative to the incident. The Incident
has been magnified. Besides, In the event
of diplomatic complications the President
would have communicated with the Min
ister of Foreign Affairs."
General Merrier replied that he went |
to the Elysee Palace as Minister of War.
He recalled that General de Boisdeffre
could testify in regard to the orders re-

M Casimir-Perier resumed his testi

"I do not wish to answer them." said
the former President. "The circum
stances are too sad and too tragic for me ,
to try to envenom the discussion.".
"I am master of myself and of my con
science " continued the witness. "I would
only state that General Mereier has made
every effort to mix me as deeply as pos
sible in this affair. But I have remained
aloof. I affirm, during the progress of the

"I, who am neither an engineer nor an
expert In handwriting," added General
Billot, "saw in that direction the grand
work lie had accomplished."
Alter this General Billot referred to
Colonel Picquart's proposition to entrap
Esterhasy, whom hr> suspected, but Gen
eral BUlol forbade this. He added that
Colonel Picquart's action was without
authorisation.
ral Billot referred to the eminent
services Colonel Picquart had rendered to
the army, leading to his being intrusted
with a contldentlal mission to the East
and afterward to Tunis. He energetically
protested against the allegation that he
had desired to send Colonel Picquart to a
place from which he would never return.
He explained his devotion to the country
and army, ami said his anxiety respecting
crets of the national defense often
entailed exceptional measures, like resig
nation and going to distant points whence
it was possible i" return with a superior
rank, and where heroism certainly wiped
out everything except treason. (Sensa
tion.)
After justifying hi? course toward
Colonel Picquart, General Billot explained
what he had done In connection with Es
terhazy. He then renewed his protests
against the attack the defenders of Drey
fus made upon him during the trial of M.
Zola, and concluded by expressing a re
gret that while in power he was obliged
to devote mosi of his time to the Dreyfus
affair, which time, he added, ought to
have been given to the guardianship of
the national defense.
M. Demange Invited General Billot to
explain the statements nf MM. Barthou
and Poincalre, former Ministers, that the
general was once so doubtful of the guilt
of Dreyfus that he did not sleep for sev
eral nights.
General Billot acknowledged the state
ments were true.
Answering questions of counsel, the gen
eral said colonel Picquart's revelations
produced doubts in his mind. but. he
added all the same, his conviction of the
f guilt of Dreyfus remained unchanged.
There was a great sensation when M.
Demange mentioned the opinion ex
pressed by M. Barthou that General Bil
loi had been forewarned in regard to the
forgery of Lieutenant Colonel Henry. Th.Â»
gen< nil acknowledged that the Henry
Forgery was among the factors arousing
his doubts.
Continuing General Billot said ne was
Immensely surprised and deeply affected
by the revelation of the forgery, tic said:
""[ never c iuld have believed a superior
officer could be guilty of forgery."
General Cavaignac, former Ministjr of
War was the next witness called, ileply-
Ing to the president of the court, ne savl
he was the first Cabinet Minister to as
sume responsibility to Dreyfus. He had
closely followed the inquiry of the Court
or' Cassation and still he desired to asso
ciate himself with the responsibility of
in 1594 wiio protected the honor of
the army against treason. (Sensation.)
continuing, the witness said that anwns
the principal points upon which he based
his conviction was the confession to Cap
tain Lebrun-Renaud, in support of
which contention he quoted a passage
from an alleged letter of Dreyfus, but
which in reality, was part of General
Gonse's report of the Minister of War on
Colonel Dv I'aty's de Clam's report of the
red confession.
M Cavaignac admitted the possibility
of mistakes in human testimony and said
they ought to be taken into account when
condemning a fellow-man. Bur, he as
â  he was. convinced of tne guilt or
i >â  >yfua because iris accusers wore so en
tirely in agreement as to their testimony.
The witness aiso said he found addi
tional proofs of the prisoner's euilt in the
technical character of the bordereau, and
lie thought the bordereau alone estab
lished the fact that the treason had
emanated from the bureau of the general
Staff and from an officer who was able
to secure all the information desired.
According to M. Cavaignac, even in his
attempts to hue his crime, the accused
had "allowed words to escape him which
In Jsputably established his guilt.
Everything, according to this witness,
condemned Dreyfus, and he .claimed that
in spite of the prisoner s denials it was
established that he had been everywhere
it was necessary to procure the informa
tion in question. It was established, th*
witnc-^ asserted, that thÂ»- prisoner had
copied plans of the proposed concentra
tion of the army. Witnesses, he claimed.
would testify in support of this assertion.
M Cavaignac discussed the denials or
Dreyfus and said his excuses of lapse of
memory were inadmissible. Dreyfus, he
claimed, was aware of the changes in the
bridge corps belonging to the artillery
and also the details of concentration.
Why then, the witness asked, had he de
nied 'this knowledge. â 
Tt was impossible, according to M.
Cavaignac, to credii that Bsterhazy was
a traitor even admitting that the border
eau was written by him. Ksterhazy, he
insisted could only have acted as the In
termediary of an accomplice. The in
quiry "f '<h p ''" urt " f Cassation proved
treason was really committed, and ne km.
Cavaignac) had not based his conviction
of the culpability of Dreyfus solely on the
handwriting 6f the bordereau.
In the secret dossier, he said, there werfÂ»
many ekments for conviction, and he pro
to discuss all the allegations made
by foreigners with the view of exculpat
ing Dreyfus. For Instance, he said there
w ,,uh! be official denials which would
leave plenty of room for the truth to Â«â 
--cane Besides, it was quite possible the
accused was guilty of treason without
having dire<t relations with agents of a
foreign Government, and a certain Em
oassador had admitted that his military
attache had spied under the immunity2
PREPARING FOR WAR

Â© CAPE TOWN. Aug. 14.â A dispatch from Pietermaritzburg, capital â¢
$ of Natal, says that at a farmers' meeting culled there to consider the g j
X defense- of the colony it was resolved that the duty of every loyal, able- A i
It bodied colonist, able to rise and shoot, was to aid in the defense of the *? j
v colony against invasion, and it was announced that volunteers would be g j
<> sent to the frontier in the event of war and the rifle associations would Â§ j
& be left to defend their own districts. Â«3 ;
M The reported shipment of 400,000 pounds from London banks is be- Â£*
& lieved to be due to the enormous purchases made by the Transvaal I

i? ever the latter are still in use. / is
g-'ven to diplomats. M. Cavaignac also
found in the contradictory statements of
forelsn diplomats that Dreyfus was well
known at various chancellories.
Colonel Jouaust asked M. Cavaignac,
â¢â¢How do you explain the Henry for
perv?" and" the witness repeated the
statements he bad already made on the
subject. He dwelt at length on M. < uig
net's long investigation. Â«Â«r,,_Â« *r.
Colonel Jouausi then asked, W hat do
you think of the Henry forgery in rela
tion to the facts now occupying our at
tention?'- -. . Â â â 
â¢â¢The Henry forgery., replied M. <_aA
aipr.i'c "as alleged, was in order io se
cure Jai revision of the case by the Court
of Cassation, and was not even alluded
to. This forgery, therefore, should re
main outside of the scope of the ques
tions submitted by this court-martial.
That Is my ion."
Replying to another question, M. Cav
'elgnac said his statement that Dreytus
went to Brussels in the middle of l s .-4
rested on hearsay.
II Cavaignac introduced during the
course of his evidence a memorandum,
written in German; asking for various In
formation, warned by the embassy,
which appears to have been unearthed
from the archives of the Bureau of In
formation of the War Office. He said he
believed it wad written by a military at
ta M. P bf mange asked why M. Cavaignac,
who was so anxious to incriminate Drey
fus had not produced this document in
the Chamber of Deputies.
The witness replied that he had other
means of reaching the ends. . |
Counsel for the prisoner then questioned ;
M. Cavaignac In regard to his statement
thatiÃoisdeftre was absent from Paris on
November 6 when General Merder de
clares he was there. The witness replied
that! General de Boisdeffre was certainly
absent on that date. .
â  Colonel Jouaust remarked thai this par
ticular would be elucidated when General
hol^?&%tt& told Dreyfus to |
rise and asked him if he had any re
marks to make upon the evidence. _
The prisoner, who during M. Cavaig
nac . arraignment of him had seemed
nervous and agitated, replied In a low ,
X "': ce a *m astounded that the man who pro
duced in the tribunal of the chamber the
Henry forgery can come hero and base
his convictions of my culpability on mat
ters which the . curt of ( assation has a.
ready disposed of." (Great sensation >j
General Zurlinden; also a former Minis
ter of War, was the next witness. He
began by pointing out the obligation rest-,
ing upon those directing espionage to '' '
everything possible to save those serv
ing them when the latter were discov
ered He then declared thai he. still re-:
garded the bordereau as being decisive
proof of the guilt of Dreyfus and sr.id
the crime committed would be impos -.
ble for those who were prosecuting Drey
fus and who should be acting from 'â â â¢â de
dc corps, and it would be as unjust to
s;iy so as to I rove the "odious act
siThisi inquiry Into the honor of the array
had" nothing to do with the affair. Gen
eral Zurlinden then traversed the old {
ground and declared that not anything
not even Henry's confession, had changed i
his conviction. The prosecution of Di , -
fus. the witness asserted, was quit un
foreseen, and â â â :â â¢ the idea ol
machinations was untenable.
The reiteration by General Zuriinuen
of his firm belief that Dreyfus wrote the j
bordereau [created lively excitement. j
M. Demange suggested that if Colonel
Fabro. had not thought or examining the
handwriting of the probationers the my- .
dereau would then have been eternally â 
buried In the archives of the Ministry of '
War; and he remarked: .v : â¢ .
"If this is the case it must be evident â 
thore is nothing in the bordereau which ;
indicated Dreyfus.'.'
General Zurlinden in a troubled voice
acknowledged -his -fact conclusively and
tried to explain. M. Demange, however.
got General Zurlinden to admit that it
was not until niter the condemnation that j
the study of the bordereau seemed to In
dieato that it was the. work of a â  proba- !
tioner.
In reply to further questions General
Zurlli â¢ said that in order to know the
whole truth in regard to the bordereau \
they must have the four notes therein
mentioned. They must be secured.
At this point Dreyfus Interjected: "I
associate myself with those words, my |
colonel." I also desire the truth, i only j
ask- for the â  ruth."
These statements caused excitement in
court. ,
General Chanoine next testified. He
briefly affirmed his -belief in the culpability
at the prisoner.
The appearance of M. Hanotaux, the
fornsf-r Minister of Foreign Affair?, who
followed him in the witness box, reawak
ened the interest of tho audience. M.
Hanotaux declared, he had nothing that
added to his evidence given before the
Court of Cassation. He said he never had
cognizance either as a Minister or as a
private individual of any secret dossier.
He recalled the circumstances under
which ho took office; saying the foreign
portfolios thÂ« presented grave difficul- i
tly;. The negotiations with Groat Britain ;
and: Belgium with regard to Africa. th-> i

NO GAIN FOR DREYFUS
IN DAY'S PROCEEDINGS
RENNEB, Aug. 14.â General Billot's ex
pressions i : i'or Colonel Plcquart
and M. Scheurer-Kestner came as a sur-
Ho only raised his voice when he
explained that he sent the colonel to
Tunis owing to his meddling in manors i
â r. to his duties, but he Insisted on
giving Colonel Picquart a mission of dan
ger and at the same time intrusted him
with a post of honor.
M. Cavaignac gave his testimony in an j
oratorical manner, with marked Intona
tion, and in th<- way he might have deliv
ered a speech In the Chamber <>f Deputies.
)'..â  maintained his belief in the truth of
the confessions of Dreyfus and contended
that his (M. Cavalgnac's) attitude
throughout was that of a statesman.
]'-.< : fus did not create a very favorable
impression when at the conclusion of M.
Cavaignac's testimony he was asked If
he had anything to say. The prisoner re
plied in a declamatory fshion. with his
hand on his heart, that the Court of Cas
sation had already disposed i t M. Cavaig
nac's arguments.
The speech of M. Cavaignac, however,
certainly appeared to make an impression
â in his hearers.
During the short suspension of the sit
xi.-.a of the court, M. Jaures, the Socialist
. who was in court, remarked that
th> arrests made in Paris had for their
sole object the forestalling of a St. Bar
tholomew massacre of the Dreyfusards
and that the attempted murder of M. La
bor! at Rennes w;;s one of the scattered
â¢ the projected massacre.
Dreyfus nn:?t undoubtedly have been
profoundly moved in the attack on his
champion, who. for all he knew, might ;
!-â  dead or dying, but he maintained the
same immovability as hitherto and di<i
not give in court the slightest indication !
of his emotions.
The depositions of General Zurlinden, I
Chamoine and M. Uanotaux were listened
to closely, but the session was utterly d.-- :
â void of any exciting incident, the mass of
!â¢ stlmony being directed against Dreyfus
and the lack of trenchant criticism, 'Â»wins
t>> tli*- absence of the defense's right arm,
naturally left an impression unfavorable j
to the prisoner.
General Mercier was acclaimed on leav
ing the court and M. < 'ajÂ»imir-Perier was
greeted with cheers and counter-cheers!
for the army.
The gendarmes dispersed the most noisy
of the demonstrators, but there was no j
serious disorder.
LABORI'S
ASSASSIN
ESCAPES
Continued from First Page.
Oast. Immediately afterward a man
shot him. His wife arrived while M.
Labor] was lying <m the ground and
Colonel Picquart and M. <ia?t were pur
suing the murderer. M. Labori turned
to his wife and said: "Go to the court
ami ask to suspend the sitting"
Mme. Labori r>>n into the court, gave
the news that her husband had been
slim and ran back to him. She sat
down on the ground beside her husband
and took his head in her lap.
During the Interval while Colonel Pic
quart and M. Cast were pursuing: the
murderer and before Mme. Labori ar
rived, M. Labori, thinking himself mor
tally wounded, uaid to a bystander: "If
I die tell my .wife my last thoughts
were for her."
There were several reports this after
noon that the assailant of M. Labori
had been captured, but they proved to
be unfounded. Detachments of troops
and gendarmes are beating the woods
and scouring the country. They have
been engaged in this work all day long
without success. A great number of
people saw the murderer fleeing, but he
was either too far distant from them or
else he succeeded in cowing them by
threats to use his revolver. A gardener
named Delahaye sot near enough to the
man to clutch him by the shoulder, but
th' 1 fugitive shook himself free and
turning to his pursuer, exclaimed:
"Begone, or I v. ill kill you. I still have
five shots left in my revolver and they
will be for you."
Deiahaye, beingr quite unarmed, re
coiled and allowed the man Ur escape.
Th" attempt made upon the life <>f M.
l^abori was evidently the result of a
plot.
A letter was sent to the Commissary
'â¢f l'ohce this morning; warning him
that it was intended to make an at
te"i ii t Upon the life of General Mercier.
Consequently, the police and detectives
surrounded the general and left the
other principals in the drama unpro
tected.
A proclamation signed by M. Lajat.
Mayor of Kcnnes, and M. Leherisse,

SUSPECT PROMPTLY
PROVES AN ALIBI
TAIiIS, Aug. 14.â A dispatch from
Lcmans, 130 miles southwest of this
city, .says a commissary of police ar
rested at the railroad station a man
named Gallon, a marine engineer, who

whose appearance corresponds with
the- description of the man who at
tempted to assassinate M. Labori. Gal

and was liberated.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, AUGUST 15, 1599.
PROGRESS OF THE SHERMAN
TOWARD SAN FRANCISCO
IN calculating the times and distances of the transport Sherman's runs San Francisco time has always been used.
Thus Ihe cable from Japan announcing the sailing of the transport was dated Yokohama, August 9, at noon,
willle in all probability the Sherman sailed on August 8 about 6:40 p. m.
The reason for this is because of the difference in date of points on opposite sides of the ISOth meridianâ
that meridian of longitude having been chosen by astronomers as the one at which each day shall commence.
Thus two ships on opposite sides of the line marking the ISOth meridian and within hailing distance <>f each
other would be in different days of the week. The one to the westward (the Sherman) would have her date card
correctly set at Tuesday. August 15, while the one to the eastward of the meridian would be equally correct with
her date card set at Monday, August 14. With the ship on the easterly side of the line day is beginning
and with the one on the westerly side it is ending as the earth moves in an easterly direction around the sun. In
consequence the vessel going to the westward or toward, say Japan, will lose a day and will jump from the 14th to
the 15th just as quickly as she can cross the imaginary line. In the same way the vessel coming toward San Fran
cisco (the Sherman) will gain a day and while at one moment it will be midnight of Tuesday, August 15, the next it
will be the morning of Tuesday, August 15. In this way the California boys will have two Tuesdays and eight days
In that week. This will only make up for the day lost in going to Manila, however. The fact that there will be two
15ths at the 180 th meridian or that the Sherman left at 6:40 p. m. of August 8, instead of nrnm on the fnh, does not
make any difference in the calculations given in The Call from day to day. San Francisco time was us--[ a t her start
and will follow her across the ocean so the days of the week will run along as though there was do 180 th meridian.
J. T. McMillan, United States nautical expert, calculates that at noon yesterday the Sherman was in latitude
40 degrees 10 minutes north, longitude 173 degrees east. In that event she had steamed 1655 knots and was a little
over 3000 nautical miles from San Francisco.
A large copy of the above map showing the course of the transport is on exhibition in the wlndov <m thÂ«> Market
street side of the business office of The Call. The map is attracting a great deal of attention, and cro<<rdfl are gathered
about the window to view it from early morning till late at night.

TRIAL OF LADY
BROOME BEGINS
Defendant Unconcerned
in Court.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA BARBARA, Aug. 14.â The trial
of Lady Frances Broome, who is accused
of an assault upon officers who attempted
;â â  remove a hedge In front of her prop- i
erty, was fairly begun this morning, the
juiy having been sworn in late Saturday i
afternoon. Lady Broome was accompanied I
in court by her pastor. Rev. \Y. 11. Flam
gey, and lion. EHlwood Cooper, who re
mained by her side during the day. She \
sat perfectly unconcerned and kept her!
eyes upon a book most of the time, not
turning them away even when the attor
neys indulged in a heated discussion.
City Clerk Alfonzu Crane and exrOlcrk
F. N. Gutierrez were examined ami ide:i- j
tilled several ordinances of the city re- j
lating to the location and direction of city j
streets and lo obstructions and nuisances L
on streets. Ex-Assemblyman James I<. [
Barker, Town Surveyor in I*7l-7:;. showed
that the Haley survey stakes at that cor
ner of Mlcheltorena and Castello streets .
indicated that the correct street line was
Bixt< en feet farther in toward the Broome
property than her fence and hedge mdi- |
cated. There was considerable discussion |
as to which was the official survey and
map of the city, the Norway or the Haley.
Lord Broome bought his property in 1870
and built an evergreen hedge around it
on the Norway survey. L.ady Broome
claimed the hedge was on her land in ac- t
cordance with the Norway survey. Tlio :

When All Are in Safety She Goes
Back After Her Clothing and
Is Cut Off by the -Flames.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
RED BLUFF. Aug. 14.â The Tuscan
Spring! Hotel, eight miles east of Red
Kluff, was destroyed by fire at 1 o'clock
this morning. Miss Belle McKenzie,
an employe there for a number of years,
perished in the flames,, after bravely
' awakening everybody on the second
floor in time for them to escape. She
â was steeping on the porch back of the
kitchen, on the second floor, and' was j
awakened by the smoke. . She called one j
of the waiters and the latter awoke, j
R. 11..I 1 .. .Walbridge, the proprietor. They
took lire extinguishers and went to the â¢
second floor.
The tire . was roaring between the
ceiling of the lower story and the floor
of th second story. A terrific west
wind was blowing up the canyon, and
by this time the flames broke out in
the rooms over the kitchen and adjoin
ing the chimney from the kitchen
range.
The flames spread so rapidly that
eighty or m â :â¢ guests had barely time j
to escape, and very few saved trunks
or clothing. Within fifteen minutes the
entire building, including the new four
s!bry hotel just north of the kitchen,
the clubhouse, three cottages and the
bottling works, were in flames. .
Miss :.â  Kenzie awakened a - great
many guests, and emerged from the j
building unscathed. Then she went
back and when last seen was upstairs
in a closet, getting her clothing. A
guest from Sacramento called 10 her
and told her to let her clothing go and
pave herself. She must have become
bewildered and was cut off by the
flames. Her body was burned to a

Twelve workmen were sleeping in the j
upper story of the new hotel and some*
of them jumped to save their lives.
Charles Honeywell, a carpenter from
Sacramento, was badly burned on hand ,
and head. J. R. Ho well, a painter from
Sacramento, jumped nd alighted on
a tree, which was burning. This broke I
his fall and probably saved his life. His !
hack and- feet were badly burned.
The loss in clothing and jewelry by
the guests was considerable. Many

morning, while others are still at the j
springs. Proprietor VValbridge places j

$10,200. He did not have a dollar of in

JAPANESE REFUSE
TO EMIGRATE TO
HAWAIIAN ISLANDS
BY HORACE WRIGHT.
HONOLULU, Aug. 7.â ln regard to
the matter of the Galician laborers, im
prisoned in Oahu Jail under the penal
labor contract laws, I am now in a po
sition to state, on a basis of authority,
that the statements published l>y a
San Francisco paper are about as base
less as the fake story published by the
saint- paper of the destruction of
Greater Hilo.
It was evidently unknown to the sen
sationalista that as far back as last
April an Investigation was comm<
by the United States Government at
the request of a prominent national
association and that an official report
was forwarded to that association from
the Secretary of State's Department
last month. In its preparation the in- !
jatora were assisted by the local;
government and the consular forces of
the countries to which the men be
longed.
This statement Is not made in justifl- |
cation of the imprisonment and contin
uance In prison of these men. The men I
are there and cannot legally be pardon
ed under the iniquitous laws which are
almost universally condemned in Ha- |
waii in these days.
It is curious and beneficial, however,
to note the change in popular feeling In
regard to these laws since 1872. In that
year they were even tar more Btringent
and cruel to the employe than to-day
when, nominally, at least, the laborer
has some rights which his employer is
bound to respect if he can find the op
portunity to protect himself before an
â¢ court and procure the necessary
witnessesâ not invariably an easy task
in the face of plantation Influence. In
the Legislature of 1872 there was a
small minority of honest, upright, lib- j
eral minded men who risk-! loss of
lif< and destruction of property by op
posing these laws and who suffered
much in wealth, position and influence
In so doing.
Curiously enough in the light of
demagogic attacks upon him by the re- j
irrivals, one of the most promi
nent of these men who aided the brave
minority under the leadership of J. < Â».
Carter was the present Chief Justice
A. P. Judd, who on th>- floor of the |
Legislature denounced the law as "a
slave law."
It is to be presumed that no one is ;
desirous of injuring the staple indus- <
Try of suear. which is the present lif* ,
of the land, but only of reducing the

Day by day the thought is becoming

Hawaii to become Americanized with
so predominant and continuously in

which so large a propSr&m will be
come permanent and antagonistic to
: our ideas and customs of civilization?
. There is too much anxiety for the spec- i
ulative results of the passing hour for
many to devote much thought to the ;
future but our legislators should re
fleet that a powerful Japanese colony
.Â£ Hawaii is as equally dangerous un
der annexation as it threatened to be
under the monarchy.
In connection with this Japanese im
migration a curious thing happened on
the sth inst. The steamer Columbia ar- :
rived in port with only 72 on board in- ,
stead of 700. as anticipated, much to
the disappointment of the planters and
the immigration agents. The excuses
given are that the Japanese Govern
ment interfered and made the passport
regulations SO much more stringent
that there was no opportunity afforded
of getting men for this steamer. Other
reasons are given, such as business
rivalry between opposition immigra

HOBSON WANTS A
REPAIR STATION
Full Report on the Work
Accomplished.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 14.â Naval
Constructor Richmond H. Hobson was
heard from by the Navy Department
to-day, for the first at any length since
he was assigned to duty in charge of
the Spanish ships raised from Manila
harbor and now undergoing repairs at
I Hongkong. His report is unusually in
teresting, dealing in general questions,
such as the need of a large dockyard
in the Orient, the increasing shipping
at Manila and the prospect that Manila
j will succeed Hongkong as the em
porium of the East, the value of Chin
ese labor in all branches of industry.
etc. He says also, the three Spanish
ships which are completed, will be
worth to the Government about $<)b<.
--000, and he contemplates trying to
raise three more Spanish vessels now
at the bottom of Manila bay. The let
ter is addressed to Rear Admiral Hich
born, chief of the Bureau of Construc
tion, and Is dated at Hongkong, July
17. He says:
In compliance with the bureau's direc
tions. I inclose a special report > Â»n the
raising and repairing of the Spanish ves
sels sunk in Manila Hay.
The three vessels under construction,
the Isla de Cuba. Jslu de Luzon and Don
Juan de Austria, are about at equal stages
lof completion, which 1 estimate to I"*
i about SO per cent compared with the ves
sels fitted out ready for sea. The bat
teries and electric plant, which have not
' arrived, will doubtless be the last items. I
! estimate that the time of completion will
be about six weeks after the arrival of
the armament and electric plant.
I estimate the value of these vessels,
when completed, exclusive of armament,
!to be about as follows: Isla ue Cuba-
Hull, fittings and outfit. $140,000; ma
ehinerv, $75,000; total. $215.01)0. Isla de
Luzonâ Hull, etc., $140 .ouu: machinery.
475 000; total, $215,000. Don Juan de Aus
triaâHull etc., $125,000; machinery, $55,000:
totaJ SlMi.ooo. Tota" estimated value of
three vessels, $610,000.
He then shows that the raising and
refitting has cost about $343,000, mak
ing a net gain to the Government on
! the three vessels of $306,000. He gives
the credit for these results to Naval
Constructor Capps, who made the con
tracts.
Mr. Hobson speaks of the general
good condition of the vessels and says:
This is particularly the case with the
i parts that remained eompiet< !y aub-
I merged. Thus large engine parts were
.scarcely injured at all.
This feature has an important bearing
upon the wrecks still In Manila Bay.
' which I expect to examine with divers
i when the vessels now in hand are com
peted. The longer period that they havfl
been immersed may not have seriously
injured the principal parts and there may
lie similar advantage to the Government
In further salvage, particularly as to the
Don Antonio de Ulloa and thÂ° Velasco'.
-istiT ships to the Don Juan de Austria,
which, from all accounts, suffered : sa
damage than those that have been raited.
Mr. Hubsnn then urges the desirabil
ity of a well-equipped United States
dockyard in the Far East as, he says,
the cost c-f private work is very high.
He adds:
There -would be great advantage to the
Government in the establishment In the
Philippines of a yard thoroughly equipped
with docks and a plant capable <>f doing
all the work of docking and repairing of
the navy. The British Government is un
dertaking such an establishment here,
though at great cost. Involving the mak
ing or reclaiming of a large part of the
land required.
Attention should be called, however, to
the fact that the success and advantage
of such an establishment, as. indeed, the
success of any Industrial establishment in
this part of the Orient, would necessitate
the employment of Chinese labor. This
labor is not only unlimited in supply, but
tt la equal to practically all the require
ments of modern industry.

Only Honorable Course to Turn the

Natives.
CHICAGO. Aug. 14.â "This Government

the islands over to a native government."
United States Senator R. F. Pettigrew of j

STEAMER ASHORE ON
CORREGIDOR ISLAND
She Is Believed to Be the United

Hooker.
TiOXDON, Aug. 14.â Lloyds has received
a dispatch from Manila saying that a

ashore near the mouth of Corregidor har
bor; ai the entrance to Manila Hay.
The dispatch gives the vessel's name as

"Queen of the Fleet" Gains Twenty
Seconds on Each Mile of a

Course.
Spa lal Dispatch to The Oa.ll.
NEW POUT, R. L, Aug. 14.â The
yacht Columbia added another victory
r already splendid record to-day
by defeating Defender 13 minutes and
7 seconds over a thirty-efeht-mile
Anaorita defeated Colonia,
ijuizetta and Ariel in the schooner
class, finishing 12 seconds ahead of the
Colonia and winning the race by 1 min
ute 14 seconds, corrected time. The
j>rizes were two magnificent cups, val
-1 $500 and $1000 each for the sloop
and BCho< â â¢-' respectively, of
fered by John Jacob Astor.
Columbia sailed a splendid race and
showed that in light air she is many
minutes faster than Defender. On
every leg of the course she made gains
over Defender, and this was more no
ible on the first leg, whdeh was a
spinnaker run of 13% miles. On the
<1 les, which promised tÂ«> be at the
outset a dead beat to windward of is
miles, Columbia showed again that ?he
could both outfoot and outpoint the
.Oder boat. The wind shifted several
points at a time until it had swung
from northwest to almost southeast.
This did not materially affect the posi
â ti'jris of the racers, except on the wind
ward work, and then a sudden change
from about northeast to east illustrated
â what a great difference a sudden shift
will make as regards the position of
the leader.
After rounding the Block Island mark
the Columbia started to beat to
West Island mark bemt, with a lead of
two minutes and forty seconds over the
nder. The Columbia immediately
tacked to port and headed on toward
The Point Judith shore. The Defender
I in Columbia's wake- and fullo'.v
--i d her for over a half hour.
In the meantime the fmir schooners
had rounded' the leeward mark and
stood out to sea on a port tack. The
iuntered a favorable shift of
j had been sailing about
thiity minutes, on that tack.
The Defender was about six minutes
behind the Columbia when she tacked
under the lee o-f the Columbia. But in-
Btead of following her fast rival, Cap
tain Rhoad.es stood out to sea and
found that there was some advantage
in be gained by so doing.
When the Defender finally came
about on the starboard tack it was seen
that siie had lessened th>- distance be
and the Columbia by
â  two minutes, and later, on this
- . Bhe got another favor
shift, which helped her immensely.
The Columbia made great speed with
- flattened and at the West Island
mark had added three minutes five
Is to her lead.
< <n the home run Defender tried to
cany a spinnaker, but when Captain
dcs found that in order to kec-p
it full he would have to head away off
the course he dropped it below deck
in a hurry. Columbia, on rounding the !
weather mark, set her bLg balloon jib
::nd â¢ it pu ndidly, but in addi
tion to this Captain Barr set a balloon
stay sail, which helped wonderfully.
Experts who fisured out Columbia's
say that she had beaten Defender
at the rat' â¢ :- every mile
<if the course sailed. Columbia gained
( n the first leg 6 minutes i r > seconds; on
the second leg, 3 minut'-s 5 seconds; on
I Ird leg, 3 minutes 47 seconds. Co
lumbia won by 13 minutes 7 seconds.
Any yacht belonging to the club
which had made any of the squadron
runs may sail in cruising trim for the
"wind-up cups." There will be a prize

every heat trotted.
The opening event was the 2:40 trot,
I best three in five, and a purse of $1000
j awaited the winner. "When the bell first '
rang seven horses were under the wire.
i McGregor & Hockin's bay mare, Eleanor
I Ann, by Illustrious-Black Bess, took the
first heat in 2:19 and had several lengths
to spare. She won the second heat in â 
2:19% in about the same manner. Frank !
McGregor himself was up behind her and
as the mare came down the line the Santa
Rosa spectators fairly went wild. When
: it came to the third heat, however, the
little lady was tired and failed to keep
up. J. B. Stetson's mare, Tickets, took
a heat and Charles Clarke's Listerine fol
lowed with two. Tickets got another and '
all except those three were sent to their !
stables. â¢
It was three horses out and two heats j
to each. Each driver had "blood in his
eye." The three racers came down neck j
and neck and had an ideal start. Llaterine !
finished first and took the race. Eleanor ;
Ann came in second and captured second ;
money, and Tickets got third money.
The second race was the 2.19 trot, best \
two in three, for a purse of $1000. Eleven
horses were in the field. W. H. Lums
den's brown mare Myrtle took the first :
heat in 2:13^ without any trouble, but T. i
J. Crowley's black horse Addison took
the nest two in 2:15^4 and 2:19, winning the
race and first money. The Santa Rosa
mare took second money, as she finished :
second in the second heat.
The third and last race was the 2:30 ;
pace, best three in five. For this event j
$1000 had been hung up. Ten side-wheeler* |
started, and when four heats had been
paced it was announced that on account
of the lateness of the hour the race would
be put over till to-morrow.
The spectators certainly had a run for
their money to-day, and great things ore '
expected of to-morrow's programme. The |
races will continue the entire week. The i
city is crowded with strangers, and â  the |
success of the meeting assured. The sum
maries follow;

OLD COMEDY IS
PRESENTED BY
THE FRAWLEYS
"Under Two Fiags" at
â¢the Alcazar.
THE TIVOLI OFFERS "FIDELIO"
i
CELLIEB'S MERRY COMIC OPERA
WELL RENDERED.
The Columbia Repeats "The Adven
ture of Lady Ursula" â New Vau
deville Features â Attrac
tions Well Patronized.
"Glee, glee, mode a living thingâ Nature,
in some frolic mood, shut up a merry devil
In her eye, and, spiting art, stole joys
: brightest harmony to tiirill her laugh,'
I which peals out sorrow's knell. Earth
! seems to laugh that it made a thing: so
glad." This is* Lady Gay Spanker, and
; I-ady Gay Spanker is the pivot of "Lon
â  don Assurance," a comedy still somewhat
â  lusty and vigorous at nearly three-score.
! Not because of its plot, for that lacks in
j terest, but rather because of rapid ac
-1 tion, "smart" dialogue and the possibility
I of unlimited "business." The shabby-gen
teel characters, most of them, have a
! noisy desire for pleasure and excitement,
â  with no moments of collapse and inertia.
! They iire heartless and flippant, they have
: not ft serious thought, and the necessity
i of living down to the hard, even basis of
, their circumstances never intrudes itself
I into their experience.
Lady Gay Spanker is but lightly bal-
I anced on the edge of a rein, but nothing
' could disturb her equilibrium by the
! breadth of a feather. Her description of
the most glorious "run" that ever swept
over merry England's "green cheek." be
; loved of the elocutionist, is her real mi
i troduction to the audience. Here one
gauges the ability of an actress to play
i the part. Miss Bates, in her riding cos
' tume, was quite a picture, and her dehv
-1 cry of the speech remarkably good. It is
the best thing she has to do In the play,
and it is a pity it comes so soon. When
filled with the spirit of the chase Lady
Gay is altogether charming. In her so
berer moments we find her a little dull.
Lady Gay, I mean, not Miss Betes, lor
Bhe is never dull. Sh* marries her Dolly
fur "freedom," but she never seems half
so "gay" as her name. In h.-r horsey
moods she is charming:, and suggests all
manner of possible fescapades. but she
never lives up to her first Bcene, and we
should like the order ot things reversed.
Miss Bates, an excellent Lady Gay. was
weighted by the rather slow movement of
The players as a whole. "London Assur
ance" should go with a dash.

iVr-n It lithe only real stupid part
in the' comedy, and that it fell to her lot
s her misfortune. She looked a picture
in the gown and hoops of the period and
seemed quite at home in them. too. It is
hard to resist the conclusion that had the
part been less stupid one might bave

about her. and who dances quite gayly
in the drawing room with her betters, was
uiven a uuamt picturesque setting oy
Kiss Mould and lingers In the memory as
a rather more important part than it 18,
by reason of her good acting.
"Max Harkaway, a plain man who
speaks his mind, the fox-hunting country
gentleman, the only character in the play
with even a shadowy moral sense of recti
tude, was made a most natural, lovable
being by George Osbourne, who Is ever tne
artist and charms by lar-k of apparent
effort and perfect sureness of purpose.
He never makes a slovenly move. bir
Harcourt Courtley, whose "toilet is a
ceremony Bret In importance, who, while
still the fiance of one young woman,
plans to elope with another man s wile
and then inconsistently closes his shallow
four-act career with a moral lecture to
his son on the attributes of a gentleman,
was quietly but rather colorlessly played
by Charles King. One cannot say he was
not good, but Mr. King is a clever actor
and should have made the shallowness of
the' man more apparent. He was not
an ornamental sort at best.
Charles Courtley, the worthy scape
grace son of his father, tamed a little t>y
love, gave Francis Byron one of the best
opportunities he has had to prove his
ability and he did not miss the oppor
tunity. Ills exaggerated love scene was
done with the vigor of an impassioned
steam engine and was but one of many
good things he found it in his conscience
to favor us with. Dazzle, the quint
essence of "brass," who lived on the best
that could be procured for credit, was the
life of the comedy. Mr. Reynolds caught
the spirit of the part and never for a
moment lost his breezy identity. His per
formance was most creditable and his
make-up an excellent one. ' Meddle, the
attorney, whose business is "snouting out
the dust-hole of society and feeding upon
the bad ends of vice," was made a ver
itable "black spider" by Wallace Shaw.
In costume, 1 mean, and this is as it
should be. He gave to the character a
rather more humorous than despicable
touch, but was the center of the stage
whenever he appeared.
Dolly Spanker, in the hands of J. R.
Armory, was almost the best character on
the stage. It is a small part but full of
chances. In the inebriated stage of his
short career he was inimitable. His only
fault was in disappearing in such a woe
ful state and reappearing a few minutes
later perfectly sober. The play, but for
lirst night slowness, was well presented.
The clatter of censure has but little place
and the sternest sum- total that can be
written is
TivolL
Inasmuch as "Fidello" has not been
given here for almost twenty-five years,
the management of the Tivoli is entitled
to a great deal of credit for affording the
patrons of good music another opportunity
to rejoice in the somber strains of
Beethoven's masterpiece. The company
at the Tivoli presents this difficult work
in a decidedly creditable manner. Of
course the music, being rather of a sym-
Dhonlc character, the main responsibility
of the production rests upon the orches
tra and it is surely no exaggeration to
assert that under the direction of Max
Hirschfeld the musicians achieved a re
markable success. There are in San
i laiu'isco a large number of earnest ad
mirers of the musical art who are ever
lavish to support symphony concerts. It
is well known that these supporters of
refined music consist largely ot the Ger
man element. The management of the
Tivo!< gives this class of music-lovers a
chance to enjoy a noble work, which they
are seldom enabled to hear, and they can
now show their appreciation of this en
terprise by attending the performances
this week.
Throughout the score there is apparent
a certain emotional strain, in the produc
tion of which Beethoven was ever prolific.
This master, more than any other, under
stood how to interpret various moods. Be
sides. "Fidello" Is the only opera Beetho
ven composed that has lived, and it has
never proved an error to contend that the
only successful work of a master is al
ways endowed with grandeur. "Fidello"
is somber and impressive. Its earnest
story tends much toward retaining your
interest, and the occasional dialogue gives
it s varied aspect from other grand
operatic works. The piece is mounted
well and the soloists succeed in eliciting
hearty applause. Mips Mary Ling spe
cially did some splendid work, and for
this "is entitled to the heartiest indorse
ment. Miss Ella Prossnitz will reappear
this evening as Leonora in "Tl Trovatorr."
She is now in excellent condition and will
surely prove an Invaluable acquisition.
ALFRED METZGER.
Olympia.
Although she has been playing at the
Olympia for a week Tod Sloan's sister
continues to be the chief attraction at the
Eddy-street vaudeville house. Reine Vln
ton, the ceadliner of the new bill, made
quite a hit and Armstrong and O'Neil, in
their bag-punching comedy, continue to
be popular.
Grand Opera-House.
The tuneful "Dorothy" has lost none of
Its charm by reproduction. It had an ad
dition in the person of Miss Jessie Fair
bairn from the Castle Square Opera Com
pany. She took the place of Bertha Riccl
and at once established herself as a prime
favorite. Pier character work as Prisciila
Privett. the widow, was worthy of much
praise and she made a decided hit in the
last act. Miss Fairbairn and William
Wolff as Lurcher, the Sheriff, won hearty
applause and Wolff Introduced a topical
song that won several encores. Edith
Mason made a charming Dorothy and had
to repeat the Tally-Ho" song. Hattie
Bello Ladd was equally charming as
I-ydia Hawthorne, and Georgie Cooper as
Phyllis sang and danced prettily. Thomas
H. Persse was Geoffn-y Wilder, Winfred
Go ft was Harry Sherwood, and Arthur
Wooley was Squire Bantam. Goff had to
repeatthe "Queen of My Heart" song and
! Wooley "Chanticleer Hall." The choruses
were well rendered and the orchestra ex
cellent. The costumes were elegant and
the opera well staged.
Alcazar.
Purple calcium lights, turbaned Arabs,
red-pantalooned soldiers and a saucy viv
andiere brought back at the Alcazar last
night the old melodramatic times that
have almost pass"cd into history. "Under
Two Flags" is one of the most charac
teristic of Oulda's works and Bertie Cecil
RoyaMieu Is one of h<T most character-
I istic and Impossible men. White Whittle
i sey played Bertie in a manner so lacka
-1 daisical that Oui.ta herself, had she been
', there, would have called nim before the
' curtain. Such a? it was the play waa
i wall performed and the scenery left noth
j ing to be desired. Florence Roberts dis
played the sterling qualities of the ac
tress in her impersonation of the Inter
esting role of Cigarette; George Foster
Platt was a good Rake, and Juliet
Crosby made so pretty and charming a
Princess Venetia that nobody could blame
Bertie for kissing her. There was a splen
: did house and it seemed to enjoy the im
probabilities of the play equally as well
as the tine acting.
Columbia.
"Lady Ursula," with its quaint conceits
and delightful fascination, was the bill
: at the Columbia last evening. This is the
last week of the Mi'ler Company's reper
toire week and Anthony Hope's charming
! comedy was the attraction as It will also
!be to-night. In Ursula, as usual. Miss
Anglln won high favor by reason of her
dainty femininity, her Intelligence and
rare "art. Mr. Miller was delightful as
1 Sir George and the others of the com
- party repeated their triumphs of the ear
fier production. The house was crowded
and as to-night will be the last oppor
tunity to see the charming "L.ady Ur-
I sula" another big houfe should be in at
> tendance.
Orpheum.
An attractive bill resulted in the not un
â  usual condition of standing room only at
the Orpheum last night, raron and Her
bert, new comedy acrobats, caught ihe
fancy of the audience and proved to^ be
very prolific laugh-producers. The Car
downie troupe of Irish and Scotch dancers
gave an excellent performance of their
specialties. EJsmeralda, the "famous wire
1 queen " established her right to the title.
and Caryl Williams amusingly presented
i his comic episode. Among the holdovers
i who were well received were Alexandra
Dugmnr, the amplf character vocalist;
Harry Linton and Leila Mclntyre. and the
Deonzo brothers, tin k barrel jumpers.
Chutes.
Emil and Karl Glrdell^r, grotesque acro
bats, gave an amazing and amusing per
! formance at the Chutes Theater last even
ing. Pat Kelly, the Irish comedian, kept
the large audience in a roar of laughcer
for nearly half an hour, and the "marvel
ous" Seymours, as they are announced on
; the bill, proved to be astonishing aero
: bats. The Wlllards played new selec
: tions on their unique musical instruments;
Frank and Celia Morris, the strong man!
I and woman, continued their exhibition of
strength, and Zoe Matthews sang a lot of
new conn songs.- A fat ladies' tug-of-war
will be a feature of the amateur per*
formance on Thursday night.

Some little betting was done at Corbett's
poolrooms last night on the McConnell-
Frane^ contest, which takes place at the
National Club to-morrow night. The pre
vailing odds were 10 to 8, with the former
on the long end. The local man has trie
advantage in height and reach over

Â» 4TO9TACE PREPAID*ARION VOICES WILL AID THE
VOLUNTEER RECEPTION FUND
Full House Expected This
Evening* Despite a Poor
Showing* at the Auction.
rTGURES rolled up last Thursday at
the Orpbeum still constitute the
record. Some few were sanguine that
I they would be exceeded yesterday
" at the Alhambra Theater on the oc
casion of the auction of boxes and seats
for the Arion concert in aid of the vol
unteer reception fund. They felt that tne
persuasive powers of Wendell Kaston,
coupled with the fame of the visiting New
Yorkerf. would coax more coin from the
public purse thai; an expert could count
In a week.
They were disappointed. A few dollars
rriore than $400 was the sum realized on
premiums. Fourteen boxes were marked
to "be sold. Two found purchasers. Of
the nearly 1700 seats only 125 were knocked
Sown at a premium. Notwithstanding this
poor start the committee in charge is cer
tain that it will pack the house at the
prices set. $1 50 and $2. So confident were
they of this, yesterday afternoon that they
w â Â»-> ."â  - -^ - - - -.-â .â  T
refused an outright offer to purchase i
every seat in the house remaining- for to
night's concert. Mrs. A. S. Townsend,
who set the pace at the Orpheum auction,
â was v ie lady that made the offer.
"How many seats have you left?" she
â¢ asked Managers .M.jit and Elllnghouse.
'lifter explaining her sorrow that she had
'been' unable to attend the auction. They
figured up.
"Four thousand seven hundred dol
lars." they said, together.
"If you will give them to me now, I'll
s^nd you a check for them."
Neither manager fainted. They both
Ftaggered, however, and it was some sec
onds before they explained that they
would have to consult the committee.
Mrs. .Townsend waited. The committee
paid it. would hardly he fair on the pub
. IJc m sell out by â¢wholesale, but suggested
that Mrs. Townsend be allowed to pur
â  chase the seats in the balcony. Their
price was $1500.
Mrs. Townsend -was on the point of |
.taking Them when she recalled the fact j
that she wanted them for her soldier boys j
â at the Presidio.
" "Th.ere won't be enough to go around,"
she said.
Then came the opportunity of Mott and
â¢Ellin^rhouse. They suggested the forth
coming popular price benefits at the Al- j
hamhra. Mr?. Townsend fell in with their
idea- and announced that she would buy ]
EOOO. tickets for the boys to whom she i
â would distribute them herself.
The lower portion of the Alhambra was
so poorly filled at noon yesterday, the
hour set- for the sale, that Colonel Lyon,
the auctioneer, had to implore those In
-the balcony to descend and fill , up. Only
a few well-known people ere present,
including. Charles Bundschu. R. O.

jQHIXATOWN is imbued with the
spirit of enthusiasm which the
>f enthusiasm which has
prompted the citizens of this city
to contribute so handsomely to the
fund 'or tho reception of the Califor
Â°.Tiia volunteers. Representatives of
"the Chinese Six Companies attended
..'the meeting: of the finance committee
yesterday afternoon, and their spoken
.man stated that more than $3000 would
be contributed by the Chinese mer
chants .of the city. Wong Wai of the
.Yeong Wo Company handed the com
mittee $o2S as the contribution of that
company. The others said they wished
a few more days' time.
. The Chinese stated that they did not
desire to participate in the parade,
"but would give a grand display of fire
works, with considerable Celestial mu
sic on the side, if the committee would
secure for the purpose a suitable loca
tion along the -line of march. The gore
at the intersection of Battery and
Market streets was suggested, but the
Chinese seemed to feel that they
would have no chance in that section
of the city. They wanted the City

after 12 o'clock and, while deploring the
size of the gathering, was inclined to
hope great things from it. He spoke of
the fame -of the Arions and of the cause
in which they had enlisted, and made a
final appeal to the pocketbooks and the
patriotism of those present.
The lack of numbers in his audience
seemed to have a depressing effect "on
Wendell Easton, and he had little to say
and much of the Arions and of the cause
which they had enlisted, and made a

triotlsm of those present.
The lack of numbers in his audience

d much of that.
"The girls," he said, referring to the
theatrical women who officiated at the
Orpheum auction, "have had their in
ning. Now you boys get inâ some of you
haired boys get in and do something.
We want to make this a proper greeting
of the Pacific Coast to the Arions. How
much am I bid for the first seat?"
"I bid $15," said Eisenschimmel, and I'll
take one, two and three"
"Hold on, there are other bidders!"
And Eisenschimmel, whose mind was
disabused of the idea that he would then
and there get three for $15, sat down, a
routed expert. The bidding proceeded.

Ten dollars was the first offer, then $15,
$20 and $27 50. It was finally knocked
down to Judge J. F. HoughtoH for $30,
at which price he tookjwo seats. A rep
i resentative of Mayor .Kneian bought the
! next box for $15, and the price dropped
' to $10, at which a number of seats were

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, AUGUST 15, 1899.
NATIVE DAUGHTERSâ THE FERRY DEPOT GRAND NAY
THE great nave in the ferry building will be decorated with 1000 electric lights for the reception of the Califor
niana Workmen were- busy yesterday stringing the wires, under the direction of Electrician F. E. Wharff, who
has evolved a beautiful idee in electrical decoration. The lamps will be covered with red and white and blue crepe
paper made into tulips. A voluntary committee from the Native Daughters of the Golden West was busy yester
duy afternoon fashioning the paper in the required shape. This committee consisted ot Mrs. Mary E. Tillrnann.
Mrs Arthur D. Ccddington. Miss Esther Ralph. Mrs. C. F. Kapp and Mrs. G. H. S. Dryden. The workmen placed the
paper decorations on the lamps as they attached them to the sockets.
Plans for the naval parade under the direction nf Admiral John D. Spreckels nre rapidly taking shape. The order
has cone forth that only the smaller craft will be allowed in the parade proper. Tho other boats must be content to
remain on the fringe of the line, so all danger of accident* will be reduced to a minimum. Tickets are now on sale for
the Vkiih which will accommodate 1000 excursionists. There was a groat demand for them yesterday at Chief Wharf
inger Henderson's office, and the first eleven were-bouprht by C. T. Swain and Mrs. C. 1.. Bert, who has two sons in Com
uanv F of the First California.

ALL PARTS OF THE STATE
WILL SEND EVERGREENS
Market Street Will Be Transformed Into a Beautiful
Tropic Avenue.
PLANS for the transformation of |
Market street into a veritable fairy
vista as part of the city's garb for
a royal welcome to be accorded the
returning volunteers have been formulat
ed by A. Schilling of the decoration com
mitee. The thoroughfare will be given
the appearance of an evergreen-lined ave
nue by the liberal. use of garlands, palms,
Christmas trees and drooping leaves of
dracaena.
Mr. Martin, chairman of the committee,
and Mr. Schilling met in conference last
night and discussed the . plans, all of
which have jeceived the unqualified ap
proval of the executive committee. In
outlining his plans Mr. Schilling said:
"It is the intention of the committee
to convert for the time being every tele
graph and electric light pole on both sides
of Market street into giant redwoods.
Evergreen trees will be nailed to the
poles, cntir.-ly hiding them from view.
Where such poles are wanting wooden
posts will be set along the curbs every
twenty feet in cement barrels covered
with green cloth and ballasted with rocks.
Graceful palm leaves will be utilized al
ternating with Christmas trees and the
streets which run Into Market street will
be similarly decorated for short distances,
thus giving the effect of a general decora
tion, it will be a spectacle which has
never before been witnessed in this city
and one of unexampled grandeur."
Telegraphic replies to the committee's
request for evergreens are pouring in
froni :ill parts of the interior. In some In
stances carload lots are promised and the
committee fears that It will be so over
whelmed with the magnitude Of the of
fers that it will be compelled to regulate
the amount to be sent by each county.
August 19 ' has been set as the date limit
for the transportation of greens. As there
will ren am but three or four days for
decorative work the committee desires to
Â-,. up all the material so generously
contributed.
The committee feels grateful to the
Southern Pacific Company for its offer
to transport all evergreens free of charge.
1 hereby saving a large sum of money
which would otherwise have to be ex
pended. The members will wait on Gen
eral Mai ager Kruttschnltt to-day to ar
range for picking up the evergreens at the
various points.
The following are some of the charac
teristic replies received by Mr. Schilling
from the Mayors of the towns which, have
aereed to send evergreens:
Hanfordâ "Will send one carload of
palm leaves."'
ganta Cruzâ Will contribute one to five
hundred Christmas trees and come with
Haywards â "Put us down for a carload
of evergreens gathered by the school chil
' 7'.ak. rsfield â"Wo have palm fans in
abundance. How many do you want?"
Santa Rosaâ "We will do our share for
a generous appropriation to the reception
of California's gallant soldiers."
Santa Monicaâ "Our citizens will rn-np
erate n yours. You may expect a llb
eral shipment."
Martinezâ "Will do our best. Tell us
where and when to send."
L,oa Angeles "We are always ready to
respond to the call of patriotism. Let us
know the latest date for shipment.'
Vis.iii;. -"Can furnish carload or more
if necessary."
Riverside -"You may expect one or two
carloads of pine decorations."
Marysville- "Will send all we can. Our
supply is limited."
Orovtlleâ "Five hundred fan palm
leaves are yours; pome from Palermo and
ThermaMto. We have three boys in the
First regiment."
Redwood cityâ "Count on us for our
share."
The (ommittee desires to express its
thanks 1.1 the following florists who have
kindly volunteered to assist in arranging
the dei orations in an artistic manner:

NO OVERFLOW
IS POSSIBLE
Managers Like the Suggestion
but Cannot Carry It
Out.
The theatrical managers at their meet-
Ing yesterday took np and considered the
sugrgestiqn made through The Call that
by reason of the fact that it was Impos
sible to get seats for the Orpheum bene
fit they give an overflow performance the
same afternoon at Morosco's Grand
Opera-house, the use of which was ten
dered. The suggestion pleased the man
agers, but one and all agreed that it
would be impossible as matters stood to
carry it out. The Orpheum has no stage
entrance, the scenery necessary for th^
various acts having to be carried in
through the front door. Once in use
on the Orpheum stage, it w..uld be
impossible even if the expenses
woukl be warranted, to carry it out
through the crowds who will attend the
henef't The managers thanked The Tall
for its efforts to increase the benefit fund,
but decided that they had their hands
full with the combined show.
The Orpheum's rule. "No Beturn
Checks," will be suspended for the
convenience of seatholders at Thurs
day's benefit. This action was de
cided upon by the theatrical man
agers' committee as a mark of .appre-

i A Berkeley Plan That May
Meet With Favor
Here,
Berkeley does not propose to be outdone
by any of her sister cities across the bay
in the matter of contributing to the lund
for the reception to |be returning CaU
fornia boys. The finance committee ovot
there is working with a will, and when
the returns are all in promise that tho
college town will be on the list with a
subscription that will "astonish the na
tives." Business men, university profes
sors ami even the churches have contrib
uted, and the committee has not as yet
completed halt" of its work.
Last Sunday all of the churches of
Berkeley took up special collections f" r
the volunteer fund, and a handsomu
amount was realized. W. L. Overstre- t.
tlic secretary, has suggested to the Pa:?
Francisco finance committee that similar
action be taken by the churches of this
city. The matter will be presented to f :,- :
heads of the various churches and an -t
fort will be made to induce them to make
special collections during next Sunday's
services. â

ESTIMATE OF THE FILIPINOS.
> j â HE last appeal made to the nations by the Fili
= I pinos, which recites the facts, already affirmed
) * by one of Dewey's officers, that they had con
= quested Luzon and Panay single-handcu. and that
: under the laws of nations it was theirs by the title j
â¢ j of conquest when Spain pretended to sell it to us by
i the treaty of Paris, will again rouse what may be |
called a personal interest in these people. To what i
1 stage of civilization have they advanced and to what i
: | extent are they educated are queries that bear for- I
cibly upon their standing and upon the most deplor- j
I able relation we occupy toward them.
There are two recent contributions to the stock of
, ; information on this subject that deserve respect and ;
> : will command widespread confidence. Mr. John j
\ ; Howe Peyton of Pennsylvania, a missionary of the \
Â» Episcopal lay order of St. Andrew, who has been in
service among United States troops since we invaded j
the islands, has written very comprehensively to Mr.

; Mr. Peyton, after describing excursions into the coun- j

, their social and educational status, says: "These peo- j
ple surprise me greatly. A larger percentage of them
: read and write than I found among the country people j

, When the battle of Manila Bay was fought there
stood with Dewey on the Olympia an ex-naval of- j
! ficer, whose offer to volunteer for the day's. service
; was accepted by Dewey. This volunteer was Joseph
j L. Stickney, whose account of the battle written as j
I correspondent of The Call was the first detail to reach
the outside world. Mr. Stickney has remained in the
. Philippines and in touch with every phase of the sub-
Meet ever since, and has just issued a book, "War in
' the Philippines," which begins with the first event
, : and presents with painstaking particularity all obtain
i able documentary evidence on every side of the sub
ject. Its narrative comes down to June 14. 1899. so
that it is a reliable book of days to that date.
The author made the acquaintance of Aguin
, ! and the members of his government. He says that
, Aguinaldo is only _â¢') years old, but is a thoroughly
trained and intelligent leader, is well educated and a
; lawyer of merit. Mr. Stickney continues: "He won
his leadership not by chance but by his own energies
and abilities, joining the insurrection against Spain in j
the latter part of 1896. Spain maintained a strict j
: blockade, making the importation of arms impossible, j
and the rebellion languished.. When it was on its last
! ! legs Spain offered to meet all the rebels' demands for
governmental reform and pay the leader the sum of
$400,000 in gold to abandon the outbreak. Aguinaldo
: was to be paid the first half of the money in Hong- j
I kong, whereupon he was to notify his followers, who
were then to lay down their arms. This was carried
' out at the close of [897, and the treaty of Biyak was
â signed in all solemnity. Then, dealing with the Fili
pinos just as she had with the Cubans in i^"*. Spain
. refused to carry out the rest of the agreement and the
insurgents renewed the hostilities as fast as they could j
: obtain equipment, the $200,000 received by Aguinaldo
going for that purpose. When the United States de
clared war against Spain the new rebellion was well
under headway."
â¢ Here Mr. Stickney quotes General Francis V. .
Grcgnc, U. S. A., to show how honorable was the po- i
sition maintained by Aguinaldo. Though he was sued
. by Artacho, another of the leaders, for a division of
I the money, he kept the sum intact as the trustee of his
{ countrymen for the purpose of forcing redemption of
the Spanish pledge of government reform. This part
of Stickney's narrative, affirmed by General Greene, is
of special importance, since Aguinaldo has been held
I IP to contempt by the imperialist press as a mercen
ary who sold out his countrymen for Spanish gold.
This view of him has been of injury to the people of
the United States, who are furnishing the men an 1 â¢
money to fight him, because it represented him a- â < ;
\ mercenary quitter, a poltroon, who might be expected
. to run at any moment.
Of his officers Mr. Stickney says: "The Secretary 1
of Foreign Affairs is Cayetano S. Arellano, formerly
professor of law in Manila University, a magistrate
and leader of the bar; his assistant in diplomacy is j
Dr. Pardo de Tavera, an author of repute and grad- j
! uate of the University of Paris. The General Director
jof the War Department is Antonio Suna, a bacteriolo- <
j gist, student of Pasteur at Paris and graduate of his i â¢
i institute. Jose Alexandrino is chief of the Bureau of j c
I Agriculture and Fernando Cannon of Public Work;, !
! one a graduate of Ghent and the other of Leyden. ;
The Bureau of Hygiene and Sanitation is in charge
of Dr. Jose Albert, graduate of the University of Ber- ;
lin. Ibarra, Secretary of Home Affairs; I*asa, head of j
the Department of Justice; Alos, Chief of the Police j !
Establishment, and Tangeo. Registrar of the Depart- j:
ment of Justice, are all university graduates and law
yers of distinction. Baldomero Aguinaldo is Sccre- \ 1
. tary of War. Trios. Secretary of the Treasury, is 3j â 
j wealthy merchant, and so are Ledesma, Secretary o!
the Navy, and Romo, Chief of the Bureau of Com- â  >
merce. Pedro Paterna is President of the Filipino 1
Congress and a graduate of the University of Madrid.
! Segardo, Chief of the Treasury Bureau, is a graduate 1
: of one of the English universities."
It i- quite doubtful if any Cabinet in the world his
as large a percentage of educated men as that of the
Philippine republic, while Mr. Peyton's testimony as
to the universality of education among the people goes !
to show that the university men are not exceptional â 
instances resting upon a foundation of ignorance, but â¢â 
the natural outgrowth of the love of a people for learn- j
I ing and the liberty to which it leads.

THE IMMIGRATION QUESTION AGAIN
WITH the return of prosperity under the Re
publican tariff there has been ;m increase in the
number of immigrants hastening from Europe
to profit by the work and the wages which are now
abundant, and with that increase there has come a re
vival of the demand for a revision of the immigration
laws and the enactment of more stringent regulations j
against the admission to the country of undesirable
â  his.
Statistics given out by the Bureau of Immigration |
show that !<>r the year ending June .30, 1899, the num
ber of immigrants that entered our port.-, was .111.
--878, as compared with 220.209 for the previous year.
More than that, the indication-, arc that the coming]
year will show a very large increase over last year, for
Commissioner Powderly states in his report that he
is receiving a large number of inquiries from abroad
as t<> the best place to locate in this country.
Attention has been directed to the fact that the in
crease of immigration is largely from despotic and
comparatively unenlightened countries ct Eastern and
Southeastern Europe.' It is well known the people j
of those section's have a hereditary antagonism to gov- j
eminent because of the oppressions they have suf- '
fere-.! They are saturated with ideas of socialism, or
nihilism, of anarchy, or perhaps have no ideas at all
about government and are simply animated by discon

: tent. They do not'understand our Government or our
i institutions, have but little sympathy with them, and
': come to our shores solely because they have great
; expectations tot acquiring wealth. When those ex-
pectations are disappointed such immigrants will in
evitably join the idle, discontented classes of our great
cities Their lawlessness will complicate strikes and
all other industrial or civil disturbances, and be a con
: tinua! menace to labor and to capital alike.
It is not only desirable but imperative that some re
; striction be placed upon immigration of that kind.
; The recent investigations of the United States Indus
trial Commission show that the present laws are vague
! and lax, and it is almost impossible to enforce them.
Thus it is made clear that something should be done
at the coming session of Congress to revise the
statutes on the subject and guard the republic against i
i a form of invasion which 15 almost as evil as any j
military invasion could be.
The issue has long been before the American peo-
I pie. Time and again stringent immigration laws have
been reported to Congress, but in almost every case
: they have been pigeonholed in conunittee-rooms or
beaten on the floor of either the House or the Sen
ate. Such laws as have been enacted are now shown
Ito be comparatively valueless. The issue, therefore,
\ remains unsettled. It is to be seen whether the in
creasing rush of immigrants noted in the fiscal year
just closed and likely to be even greater in the present j
year will so arouse the people as to compel Congress ,
to t.ike action of an adequate kind without further de- j
lay.
THE PORTO RICO HURRICANE.
DETAILS from Porto Rico show that the hurri
cane which recently swept over that island
caused an amount of destruction which makes
it one of the most appalling calamities of our times.
Lack of communication throughout the island ren
ders it impossible for the officials to gather full infor
mation of the number of deaths or the extent of the
damage, but from what lias been learned Governor
General Davis estimates that upward of a thousand
persons were killed, something like ioo.ooo rendered
homeless, one-fifth of all the dwellings on the island
destroyed and all crops and most of the fruit trees
iuir.ed.
Had a disaster so widespread and so terrible
occurred in any northern country it would have en
triled famine and starvation and" a winter of desola
ticn. No new crops could be raised between now and
ti.e coming of frosts, and the ruin wrought directly
by the storm would be largely augmented by the in
evitable distress that would follow. Fortunately, it
v. ill not be so bad in Porto Rico. The tropics have
many cviK but they are not without compensating
advantages. It will be comparatively easy to erect
sa< h houses as are needed in that climate, and the
fcitilt soil under the ever-glowing sun will soon send
up tcod for the people whose crops have been de
-roved.
The one necu of the island is immediate relief, ati'l
it i: a K f ""i fortune for the people they are now a part
oi the United State?. That prompt and liheral char
ity for which our country is noted will be extended to
them. The Government itself has but little money
avalirble for help, but private contributions can be
counted on to compensate for any lack of governmen
tal ,-issistance. Our officials will go to that island not
with arms in their hands but with food, clothing and
money. The effects of the terrible disaster will bo
alleviated as far as humanity can do it. In Porto
Rico a f any rate, '"benevolent assimilation"' will not
be a mockery. To the stricken people there Uncle
.SrMii \\i!i be truly a helper and a friend in a time of
need. â¢
SOUTH AMERICAN COMMERCE.
CONSIDERABLE information concerning the
commerce of the countries south of us is given
in a recently issued bulletin of the trcasur
bureau of statistics. It has long been the aim of ou
n/ore enterprising merchants and of some of our
greatest statesmen to obtain for the United States the
bulk of that commerce, and it is therefore somewha
discouraging to learn that after all efforts so far we
have but a small fraction of it.
From a summary of the statistics given it appeirs
that while our trade with Mexico and with the West
I tidies is comparatively Rood, we are far behind other
nations in dealing with countries farther south. It is
said of the total imports of all South America, 87 per
cent is taken by the countries bordering upon the two
oceans, and but 13 per cent by those bordering upoi
the Caribbean. Marching down the eastern coast .0
South America, we find Brazil importing, in 1897
goods to the value of over $105,000,000. uf which the
United States supplied about 12 per cent; Uurugua>
and Paraguay $22,000,000. of which our share was less
than 7 per cent, and Argentina $05,000,000, of which
less than 7 per cent was from the United States, while
a tour of the Pacific Coast shows importations into
Chile of $24,000,000: Peru. $8,500,000; Bolivia, $11,
--600.000. and Ecuador, $7,000,000, the proportion from
the United States averaging about 10 per cent. Thus
the northern coast of South America, fronting on the
Caribbean Sea. imports goods to the value of $36,000,
--000, of which we supply an average of 25 per cent
the eastern coast, fronting on the Atlantic, $222,
--000.000. and the Pacific Coast, $51,000,000, of which
our proportion is in each case about 10 per cent.
While we supply these small percentages of the
goods imported into South American countries we
are by far the largest importers of their goods. We
are the chief consumer of the coffee, rubber and other
chief articles of export of Brazil, and of the wool and
[tides of Argentina. Of the South American countries
fronting on the Pacific Coast it is noted the United
States, in 1807, purchased goods valued at $88,408,119,
while her sales to them in that year were but $24,480.
013. or less than one-third of her purchases from
them: in 1898. despite the fact that to the whole world
our sales were double the amount of our purchases.
th< to the South American countries beyond the
Caribbean Sea were still but about one-third of the
amount of our purchases from them.
The explanation of this unsatisfactory condition of
trade is that Europe owns the ships that carry South
American commerce, and as we export more to
Europe than we import from that continent, an
opportunity is afforded shipowners to make profitable
triangular traffic. The heavy exports from South
America are brought to our ports, our exports are
then carried to Europe, and European exports are
taken to South America.
Such a condition of affnirs will prevail as long as
the commerce of the ocean is under control of the
merchant marine of European nations. Our mer
chants and shipowners, no matter how enterpri-ing
they may be. cannot compete successfully with the
lidized ships of foreign nations. The trade of
h America will be ours whenever our statesmen
work for it in the only way by which it can be
mplished. Commercial treaties are of little value
5S there be ships to profit by them. We shall
the bulk of the trade of the countries south of
henever we follow the example of European
>ns and build up a merchant marine equal to the
s of the republic.
MINGLING DIVERGENT MANKIND
i Can the Contact of Two Races in the
Philippines Result Beneficially to
Either?
in.
THUS, it will be seen, the American
people have experienced associa
tion and contact with the red race,
the black race and the yellow
race. Their experience with these
forms of social contact has not
been satisfactory or encouraging. Nearly
all that our people are really ashamed of
: in their history is comprised in the In
; dian problem, the negro problem and the
: Chinese problem. Yet with all these evil
'â â  and even disgraceful results recorded dis
; tinctly in our brief history, the people of
j the United States are now apparently
I considering with favor the proposition of
intermingling with the only remaining
race with which they can experiment.
Having trif-d living with the red, the
black and the yellow, and made a wretch
ed failure in every experiment, they must
new try the brown men of the Philip
pines.
The idea of "expansion." as it is now
advanced in this country, does not merely
mean the acquirement of new territory
and the establishment of greater bound
j aries. A mere extension of area might
I not be necessary, but ft might not b* in
! jurlous. The real danger of the policy
iof expansion is in the new population
which is to be added to and form a part
of our nation.
The condition at present is quite dlf
ferent'from that involved in the â acquire
ment of the Louisiana purchase and the
Mexican territory. In each of these cases
we acquired contiguous territory, thinly
populated by a people whose location
| would have given us as much troublft had
we not acquired the territory as it ac
tually did after we-acquired it. The curse
of race contact did not become greater by
the expansion, although it continued as
before.
The retention of the Philippines, how
ever, will be vastly different. They are
not contiguous to our own country; tfteir
climate is such that they do not become
desirable .homes for the white race, and
their average population to the square
mile is already four tim< a us great as the
United States now sustains. In acquiring
the territory west of the Mississippi we
obtained a fine land thinly populated,
lying in the temperate zone adjacent to
our own country and fitted in every way
for permanent occupancy. In acquiring
the Philippines we do not get a square
mile of territory that a white man will
want to cultivate. We merely acquire the
responsibility and dan^'-r of associating
with 7,'jOO.Q'jO of Malays and Cninese, with
whom we cannot intermarry . and against
whom we will necessarily wag*- inter
mittent warfare till we either sop irate
from them or exterminate them. The re
sults cannni fail to be similar to those
arising oui of our contact with the In
dians, the negroes arfd the Chinese. It is
not a question of location l>ut of race con.
tact, for iÂ» matters not whether the
whites and Malays come together in this
country or In the Philippines., the nsu.i
is sire to be disastrous and shameful to
both.
If we permanently retain the Philip
pines we must either control the people
by despotic military government or Hue
admit thÂ»Tn to participation in our na
tional affairs, lirst as one or more Terri
tories, afterward as States. In the first
cas<' we shall have abandoned, by adopt
ing military rule, all our theories about
the rights of self-government and the
desirability of republican institutions and!
democratic ideals. We shall have as sub-|
stitutes for these the Imperialistic form?*]
of ancient Rome and modern Kngland. j
We shall have become conquerors and
rulers of other men, without any neces
sity for such action, instead of a body of
people maintaining and extending liberal
and progressive Institutions, demanding
freedom for ourselves and extending it to
others. We shall have taken the path
which led t<> the dissolution of ancient
Rome. Our people have fur y-'ars de
nounced the military despotism which
Great Britain has extended over weaker
people in all parts of the world, and 1
lake it for granted that they do not be
lieve thai this is to be their own future.
On the other hand, if we admit the Fil- j
Ipinos to participation in our govern
mental affairs as a part of the republic
we shall lower our average national
standard of intelligence and efficiency by
the admixture of ~ ,000 of Malays and
Chinese, most of them ignorant and en
tirely unfamiliar with the Ideals of our
degree of civilization, our national bound
ary s will b< enlarged to include the
islands and their people, and the result
will l"' not greatly different from admit
ting 7.000,000 of these races as Immigrants,
to become a part of our nation in that
way. ThTe is something curiously ab
surd in the present position of our peo
ple. A U m years ago they were so hostile
to the Chinese becoming a part of this
nation that they were almost prepared
to raise armies and drive tlvm into the
BÂ«a. Now the same people are actually
raising armies for the purpose of com
pelling Malays and Chinese to come into
the nation and unite with us. It should
be obvious to all that we cannot expect
from contact with the brown race any
better results than we have secured from
association with the others.
All sorts of ideas exist with regard to |
our duty toward the Filipinos. There is
the chivalrous American who considers
Agulnaldo a patriotic George "Washing
ton fighting for the liberties of his coun
try. There is ihe money making expan

advantage in the retention of the islands,

ing benevolent despotism, praising his

epaulets, and devoutly expecting the
Malay to acquire as much civilization In
a few brief years as the white race has
accomplished in twenty centuries. There
is the man of intense patriotism who in
sists that "the American flag must never
be pulled down." even though it be raised
over a dung-hill or a nest of rattlesnakes,
and who conceives it to be his duty to ex
terminate the Filipinos first and then
treat with them afterward.
All these have arguments to make along
their varying lines of thought, but it is
impossible for any of them to deny the
dangers and evils that result from the
contact of two divergent races. It mat
ters not what course we take in dealing
with the islanders: it matters not whether
it is right or wrong to rule the Islanders
with benevolent intentions instead of per
mitting them to rule themselves. The
truth still remains that we cannot in any
way bring the white race and the brown
together, either here or there, without
developing the evils which are inseparable
from that condition. What God has put
asunder let not foolish man attempt to
bring together.
It is this feature of the Philippine prob
lem which should make expansionists
pause. Expansion into the Philippines or
even into Cuba, whether with or without
consent of the people of those islands, Is
not merely the procurement of more ter
ritory. It" is- not merely the enlargement
of Uncle Sam's national farm. It is the
admission into our national organization
of several millions of people who can
never amalgamate with our own popula
tion, and who* must be either ruled as
political serfs or else exterminated. W e
have exterminated the Indians; we have
driven out the Chinese; we are now ririing
the negroes as political serfs in the South
ern States in a condition which is a curse
to the whites as well as the blacks and
a shame to republican institutions. "\\ hat
do we propose to do with the Malays of
the Philippines when they become a part
of our national organization by the policy

Slegert's Angostura Bitters.VOLUNTEERS HAVE NO
WISH TO REMAIN HERE
No Fear of Any "Desperate" or
"Idle" Characters,
Most of the Men Have Positions at Home
and the Others Can Get Them, So the
Examiner's Excitement Is Causeless.
BY constant association "with itself
. the Examiner is bringing its people
to the level of its own columns.
Half a week ego it was showering
mm] â ..; on General Shafter for using
the terms "skulkers" ami "riff-rait"
in the same sentence with "volunteers."
Now it has itself blossomed out in quoting
Its own managing; editor to the extent of
a verbatim report; with the terms "des
perate characters" and "idlers," both ap
plied directly to those of the volunteers
who have shown a reluctance to leave this
hospitable State after having been assured
that â¢ hey* were welcome.
Among those who extended the greeting
there was none farther to the front than
the Examiner. So far ahead of its com
petitors -was it that It exhausted its wel
come before tht; first volunteer hove in
sight; there was no steam whistle along
the water front that blew a louder blast
than did the Examiner with ink and
paper; there was less wind in the cheer
that tang from the ferry building to Twin
Peaks than there was in the puff the Ex
aminer cave itself while devoting a few
lines to the returning soldiers; there was
ho type too large, no column too ion no
time" too inappropriate; it was everywhere, [
and, to itself, everything, and from the j
advent of the iirst to the coining of the ,
last the Examiner has posed as the friend '
of whoever would forget himself lor a j
moment . nd talk to one of its men. It re
iKairied for the privacy of a meeting, how
ever to show the true rift of the Exam
lner's patriotism; and even then it would
hardly have come out If it had not been
thought that the words of its managing
editor, spoken at a time when the policy :
of the â â¢iit'er was for a moment lost sight
of. wen .w^rth embalming in the next
morning's issue.
"The railroad company does not
â want idle, desperate men running
around this city, and the citizens of
San Francisco do not want them."
This was the stupendous thought the
managing editor gave to the committee
on the rteeptiun in volunteers, and luiied
by the spell of his voice the paper printed
It in the morning. It would have beta
much better; failing to persuade the man
aging editor to hold his tongue, to have
overlooked this burst of luencc. but
the [Examiner had tit that mom 1:1 ax j
grinding upon the good will of the labor ,
unions of this city, and to secure a bet
ter edge it forgot all the good wind it had
shown' the â  volunteers and it be ray a
them..
What business ha the Examiner to
raise the cry of "desperate" and ' idie
when a halt hour spent at the Preuldlo
would have shown that the volunteers do
not wish to stay there; that they have
positions of their own awaiting them;
that all they are hoping for is a chance 10
get home to their own people; that they
have no desire to rest under the shads of
the Examiner's columns and listen to its !
ceaseless babble; that they are a better 1
class of men than the Examiner can ap- j
prc-ciate; that they are not anxious to I

'â  some who have lived here and whose peo
â  pie are now residents of the State and

: all the others will go. There are no Ore
gon men hanging around, "desperate"
and "idle." Oregon was glad to get tin m
! all back, and Oregon is fully tin to the
Examiner standard of virtue. " Utah wants
i all her nun back.
""We don't want to leave a man," said
Lieutenant Hines, the battalion adjutant,
yesterday, and his words were 4 afterward
echoed by Major Grant and Adjutant
General Burton of Utah. And. the Exam
iner will have a hard time finding a Utah

unless it hunts in the hospital. There are
some Utah men there who will stay for a
while, although they are neither "des
perate*" nor willingly "idle." Adjutant
Scott of the Pennsylvania men says the
same. "We will not leave a man here if
we can help it," he says, "and I am sure
|we can take them all. And even if we did
I leave some of them they are good enough
| citizens for Pennsylvania and we will bo
sorry to go away without them."
Then there are ' others who express
i themselves in this wav:
MAJOR CUTHBERTSON. Tenth Perm-
I sylvania/â can safely say that those
j members of our regiment who will be
; left behind will not be classed under the
: head of dangerous, lawless men. The fact
of the matter is there will" be few Penn
sylvania boys left here. I don't think any
of the boys will stay here and those who
do will not be found lacking in soldierly
bearing and gentlemanly instincts. Our
regiment is composed of the sons of the
finest families in Pennsylvania and every
one of them is a gentleman from' the
ground up.
MAJOR GEORGE NEFF. Tenth Penn
sylvania â volunteer army is com
posed for the most part of young men,
respectable and honorable, and most of
them had good positions when the war
broke out. The insinuation that there
will be left here scores of dangerous
characters is unfair and unpatriotic. The
Tenth Pennsylvania Regiment i;- made up
of men who left colleges, banks, news
paper offices :*.nd law books to enlist in
their country's cause. That sort of men
never make lawless citizens or dangerous
characters. The boys of the Tenth are
all anxious to return home and I don't
think any of them will be left here.
LIEUTENANT HOWARD, Tenth Pen
j sylvaniaâ There isn't a man in the reg
I mc-nt whom the State of Pennsylvania
, will not welcome back with open arms.
; If they are lawless, dangerous or deeper-
I ate characters I'd like to meet a few more
: like them every day. They are as fine a
! Bel of boys as ever put foot In California.
MAJOR BIER.ER, Tenth Pennsylvania
â would feel safer with one of our boys
than I would with anybody in the Ex
aminer office. The volunteers as a class
are a most desirable aggregation of me
Our regiment represents some of th
finest families in Pennsylvania, None of
our boys desire to remain here. I'll vouch
for any one of them who happens to be
so unfortunate as to lose the train.
LIEUTENANT COLONEL FRAN"
EAGER. First Nebraskaâ There will on
be a few of our boys who will remain
here, possibly not more than six or seven
They simply Intend to tour the State.
Our regiment does not contain any of
those dangerous, desperate men who have
caused so much consternation. The vol
unteer army as a whole represents the
better class of people throughout th
United States. The army is a bad place
for a bad man. They soon find him out
and hr- doesn't last long.
PRIVATE BYRON McKEOWN. Com
pany H. Tenth Pennsylvaniaâlt seems to
me the statements are rather rough on
the volunteers. They struck me as be-
Ing a respectable, law-abiding clement. I
know there's not a man In our regiment
who com<p under the head of dangerous
or desperate. A man who is patriotic
enough to enlist In the army and fight for
his country is generally made of the right
kind of material, and it's a shame to at
tempt to blacken his character. They
don't need to be nfraid of any of the
Pennsylvania boys. I can vouch for
every member of the regiment.
PRIVATE GEORGE MEWSâ I can
safely say that no member of our regi
ment can be termed a desperate, danger
ous character. Why. in Company I ajon6
thero are twenty-two lawyers, in >1 f"im
pany there are several doctors and other
profess! men. The regiment as a
â whole represents a high standard of
Pennsylvania's citizenship. I can safely
predict that all of our regiment will re
turn home as soon as the men are mus
tered out.
CAPTAIN CRITCHLOW. Battery P..
Utah Artilleryâ l had not given the mat
ter much attention, but one thing l can
say with Impunity, "I .know of no dis
reputable characters in my battery." The
men have all been well treated since their
sojourn here, and, beyond hearing of one
or two members that have signified their
intention of remaining behind. I think all
of the men will return to Utah.
QUARTERMASTER BURCH of Bat
tery B. Utah Artillery, when he heard of
the allegations that had been made be
smirching the characters of the volun
teers, smiled and said: "Well, I don't
think the people of this city will be trou- j
bled by the men of this battalion. Most, j
of them left good positions in Utah, and j
aside from two or throe members, who,
1 understand: are residents of this State,
the boys will return as a body. If we
h.^ve any hard characters among us they
have vet t<> come to the surface."
SERGEANT. BEZ/.ANT'. Battery A,
Utah Artilleryâ l have heard none of the
men if this battery express a desire to
remain behind. The people of Utah are
proud of the record made by the organiza
tion, and I can recall no "desperate men
or vagabonds" among the enlistments.

us."
CORPORAL JENSEN. Battery B. Utafc
Artilleryâ l have heard that three or four
of our men might remain here upon the
( departure of the battalion, but under
stand they were former residents of this
State. No, 1 don't know' of any rough
characters among us. Of course I have
expected there would be some talk, but
I think the I'tah mm will do nothing to
reflect discredit on the organization.

ple ire" to stay here, but this State is
their home. Some of the battery may
come back here at some future day, but
after being mustered out San Francisco
! will know us no longer.
Private Morton could recall the names
of no thugs or miscreants of any sort in
his battery.
PRIVATE H. G. BEANE. Battery B,
Utah Artillery, know of but one man that
would not return to- I'tah and that ia a
former resident. He laughed and said,
"The railroad companies or labor organi
zations will not be troubled by us fel-
PRIVATE JAMES QUINN of Battery
| B reaffirmed the story of his comrades.
I He was not aware of the presence in the
, battery of any desperate or dangerous
men to pester the populace of this city.
, He thought the mÂ«-n would leave for home
a .In a body.
There a good many of the volunteers
who. after th.-y have spent some time at |
home, will come out here again and settle i
down. Does the Examiner wish them to
stay away? And if it does, will it cancel ,
: the columns of matter it ran while boom- I
i ing the old Half-Million Club of this city? \
: And its frantic efforts to get the farmers j
j to admit that they were prosperous and
able to sell their land and what they pro- ,
duced on it? And its endless wails about :
I the decline of real estate and the need of
! more people from the East to join us?
The Examiner has run an erratic course
for a good many years, but none of its
wild utterances have ever been so wanton j
or as ill advised as its latest cbaracterixa- !
I tlon of the volunteers who might wish to i
stay among tis. To class them a.ll as '
; "desperate" and "idle" Is the worst kind
:Of foolishness. It insults them and it in- i
j suits the city. The city is used to it. but j
j the volunteers are not. They feel hurt
j that anything has been said to sour the |
! taste of their welcome, for that kind of !
: left-handed hospitality is never forgotten.
â  It is too bad the Examiner could not have, j
j refrained from quoting its own managing
| editor. It might, in the little charity it
j possesses, have kept quiet just a little
longer.

The Judge Pays Attention to Men

F. E. Rockstroh. proprietor of a drug
store at Seventh and Howard streets, has
got himself into serious trouble through
violating the law by selling poison with
out a physician's prescription, and also
for conducting the store without having
a registered pharmacist in charge.
He was convicted on Saturday by Judge
Tread-well on the charge of not register
ing the sale of opium to John Keenan,
and appeared for Sentence yesterday. The
Judge took occasion to express in forcible
F. E. ROCKSTROH.
language his opinion of Rockstroh and his
pretended mistake in giving Keenan crude
opium for gum arable. In the course of
his remarks the Judge said:
No man should be permitted in thin city
or in any other city to Fell drugs by prescrip
tion in bulk or in any form without having a
thorough knowledge of pharmacy. There is
no tellliiK how many unfortunate persons have
suffered by the druira compounded and admin
istered to them nt the hands of this confessed
violator of the law. I may add also that this
city and county i- Infested by quacks and pre
tended medical advisers who have .preyed and
imposed upon the public without fear of th.
law they are also n menace to this com
munity by endangering the lives and health
of our citizens. Healers Innumerable, with

knowledge of the great science at medicine or
surcery, are permitted to flaunt their per
nicious and Immoral pamphlets at the door
steps of our families, which is a disgrace to
the community and unfit to be read.
These men have no license, no certificate,
no diploma or any other I^Kal evidence which
would entitle them to practice medicine or
surgery; PtHl they have been permitted to
prey upon the public. We . cannot tell how
many people they have killed or how many
persons henlth they have Impaired by reason
of their incompetency and ignorance of the
AMUSEMENTS.

The. Judge then sentenced Rockstroh to
pay a fine of $300, with the alternative of
130 days in the County Jail. Rockstroh s
attorney gave notice of appeal, and his
bonds were lixed in $2WO. Later Rockstroh
paid the fine.
Rockstroh was also charged in Judge
Conlan's court with selling cocaine to Jo
seph Carter without a physician's pre
scription. When Carter appeared in court
the Judge recognized him as a member or
the company that played "Muldoon s Pic
nic" at the old Bush-street Theater. He.
is a physical wreck through the use or
cocaine and morphine. Carter was charged
with vagrancy, but the Judge released
him on his own recognizance and contin
ued Rockstroh's case until this morning.
Samuel L. Waller also swore to a com
plaint in Judge Conlan's court for Rock
stroh's arrest on the charge of conduct
ing a drug store without having a regis
tered pharmacist in charge, and he was
booked on the accusation. The Judge re
leased him on his own recognizance.

ery Given by Physicians in
Attendance.
Miss Elizabeth Mill?, youngest daughter
of W. H. Mills, vice-president and land
agent of the Central Pacific Railroad Com
pany is lying dangerously ill at her
father's residence, 2800 Jackson street.
Her condition during the past week has
alarmed her parents and caused groat
anxiety among her many friends
The young lady was taken ill last Fn- i
day morning. Her first symptom was a
chill amd Dr. Gibbons, the family p.iysi
cian'for the past sixteen years, was im
mediately sent for, and he prescribed the
usual remedies. His patient continued to
pet worse toward evening, her pulse go
ing up to 14ii and her temperature to 104.
Drs. Ellinwood and Cheney were then
called in as consulting physicians and i
lent their skill with a view to bringing ,
about the recovery of the young lady,
i >:i Sunday their patient's condition was
critical and the doctors held a consulta
tion. The anxious parents were informed
by the family physician that their daugh
ter's case was not hopeless and by Dr.
KlHnwood that there was strong hope
for her recovery. Her Illness is diagnosed
as incipient typhoid fever. Last night
there was a change for the better. Her
mind had cleared, the temperature had
decreased and the pulse registered 20 de
gTees less than on the first night. The
doctors are of the opinion that the fever i
is abating and that if there is no relapse !
she will soon be on the road to recovery, i
During her illness the young lady has
received all the care that affection and
wealth can bring. Trained nurses con
stantly watch her. as do also her mother
and sister. Mr. Mills was not at his of-
Hce jresterday and will not go there to
day unless In- is assured that his daughter
is out of danger. He has allowed his im
portant affairs to stand that he might be
at the bedside of his child and comfort
his wife and daughter.
Miss Klizabeth Mills is but 17 years old.
Her sweet disposition has made her a
general favorite with every one she hns
come in contact with. That her sickness
is deplored Is evidenced by the flowers
thai are left at her home each day by
sympathetic friends. She graduated frnn:
Miss Hamlin's school on the 22d of March
Â«'f thid year and was to have entered the
University of California yesterday. On
finishing her studies at the former insti
tution she was suffering from nervous j
exhaustion brought on by too close ap- j
plication to study.
In company with her mother and sister |
she went on' a visit to a relative in I'nrt
land Or., and after staying for a short
period the family went to Castle Crag,
but returned to the city to attend the
funeral of the late Mrs. Dr. Gibbons.
Later MLss Mills and her mother went to
San Rafael, and on her return from that
place was taken sick.
Her recovery from the severe attack is
anxiously awaited by every one.

Tuesday August 15th
in order to make the necessary preparations
for our
alteration sale
which begins to-morrow, Wednesday.
We have leased the entire building over our
store, consisting of four floors, which are now
in process of alteration.
We intend to entirely remodel our establish-
ment, adding some departments, and enlarging
and reconstructing others.
It is our intention, -in doing this, to avoid
. rehandling and warehousing our stock as much '
as possible.
In order to carry this into effect it will be
necessary for us to dispose of large quantities
of goods. We have therefore closed our
place of business to-day in order to mark down
our stock in every department to prices that are
sure to effect a
genuine clearance
The bargains we will offer during the time
that alterations are going on will more than
compensate for any discomfort or noise that
may be occasioned by the process of recon-
struction. - .. .

â¢â Peaches are unchanged. The price made on
early sorts f.ir August shipment is practl'-ally
unchanged, though some holders insist upon a

buyers an.l sellers prevents libera! sales and
restricts business to small consuming demand.
The size is likely to average smaller than usual,
because shippers of fresh fruit and c;-.nners are
buying all the large stock obtainable.
"Prunes are about steady, and there is some
consuming demand from nearby and loca/

EASTERN MARKETS
Mew, York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Aug. 14. The stock market
Btarted off with something of an upward rush.
Exchange traders and small outside following
had apparently come to the conclusion thai
Saturday's -bank statement indicated that
alleviated problems In the money situation had
been settled and that ease and abundance of
funds wore now nt hand. The first sharp ad
vance in stocks, however, demonstrated th.it
the pressure of some heavy selling would h;>.ve
to be encountered on any general upward
movement. The market thereafter Ian??-! Into
the spotty condition which lias been Its ie
cent characteristic. A small number .>:' stacks
showed very marked strength, but the usually
active and prominent stocks lay practically
dormant throughout the session and showed
a sagging tendency which the strength in spe
cial Instances had no effect toward coun'.tr
cctlng. Tennessee Coal and Iron advanced by
relational leaps an extreme C^i points, giving
color to the rumors of a corner Ii the stock
The tone was feverish below the high level
and the net gain was 3>i. The announcement
of the settlement *of the smelter strike in
Colorado' enhanced the prices of quite a num
ber or Stock*, Including American .Smelting,
which Is most directly affected. Colorado Fuel,
ljtnver and Rio Grande stocks and Colorado
Southern stocks, Gains in the group ranged
from 1% in Denver and Rio Grande to .'.'< In
Colorado Fuel preferred. The smelting i-teck*
rose -3H and 2% respectively. The railroad
stocks to show strength were comparatively
few. Tli/> Chicago Great Western dsbenturea
Marted downward after their notable ri.se on
Saturday and are nearly 2 points iff on the
day. but the preferred â  A" stock is up over
2 points and the preferred "D" . t., k over a
point. Beside these are notable gains In the
I'ittsburg. C. C. and St IÂ«ouis stocks, Louis
ville, Kansas and Texas preferred and * -me
of the low-priced railroad stocks. Confidence
ever the money situation had a relan:Â»e. the
conviction growing ' that the Saturday bunK
statement may not be a fair reflection of Sat
urday's conditions In the market. 1 â  asineea
and depression were also reflÂ«tÂ«d trom
abroad, political disquiet in Franco and ad
vancing money jn London and Bet Ho threat
ening some pressure of liquidation from titrse
quarters should this country's credit? be called
home Whatever ease IS mam in the
money market Is realized to '.c due to the
f|iietude of speculative markets ma woild
over and conservative heads in the financial
world are Inclined to frown upon an outbreak
ot speculation. The closing of the market was
active but extremely Irregular. People's iiÂ«s
mounted above 122 on the announcement of
the acquisition of the Pullman Gas Company,
while other stock tended downward. Net
changes are mixed.
The bond market showed increased activity.

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, Aug. 14â Considerable irregularity
was shown by wheat during the morning,
though prices at all times were above Satur
day's ciosing quotations An opening advance
of .'..! at Liverpool, and a still further ad- 'â¢
vance At 1:30 made the opening here strong. |
September starting at 71*ic, an advance of 'â¢â.â¢â â 
There was some disposition shown to realize 1
at tfie advance and the market wavered for
a short time, September selling at 71V. but .
the strength of the foreign markets, and some
poor thrashing reports from the Northwest gave .
confidence to the bulls, and all offerings were,
readily absorbed. September advancing to 7 1 â¢'â ââ¢. j
A period of comparative easiness followed. Out
side selling orders came In sufficient quanti
ties to depress prices, the decline being ren
dered easy by the favorable foreign crop new*.
A feature of this was the announcement thai
Russia in spite of the famine reports would
have some wheat for export. The market de
clined to 7!'--'' tor September and though rallies ,
were frequent, the tendency until afternoon
was lower. During the afternoon, however, Ihe !
market developed marked strength. The
weather in the Northwest was favorable and
the ca-h demand was poor, but this did not
discount the effect of the crop prospects, and
In the last hour a strong buying movement
set in vAilch "nrried prices steadily ward.
September advanced to 71 "3 72. And closed
strong at 7i ,c
Corn was barely steady. The brilliant crop'
prospects caused some selling, but sympathy
with wheat, ytnall country offerings and a good â 
cash inquiry supported the market. September
closed a shade lower.
During most of the session oats were prac
tically at a standstill and the range was barely
>sc. September closed a shade higher and De
i ember a shade lower.
Provisions were quiet and irregular. The
market was strong early on the sharp advance
in hog prices Declines followed on rather free
selling by a prominent packer, bin in the af
ternoon the market was steadied by the ad
vance in wheat. The close was easy for pork
and lard and steady for ribs. At the close
September pork was unchanged; lard- 2%4f5c

south side of the raise have cut into an old
Btope. The filling exposed assayed $41 60 in
gold per ton. Have extracted from the streak
of ore on the seventh floor, and fillings taken
from the old stope there, eleven tons of- ore
of an average assay value of $100 64 in gold per

187 feet; face In soft porphyry and clay. We
I have just passed through a very hard belt of
vein porphyry. The joint east crosscut, at the
point where the hanging wall (clay) was cut
through, has started to cave and we are now
timbering this part of the crosscut, as we
wish to drift east when the joint west cross
cut has reached the vein or west wall. Sutro

PROGRAMME FOR
EXTRA SESSION
Gage Wants Pledges
in Black and White.
IS AFRAID OF A DEADLOCK
DIBBLE INTERVIEWED MANY ' !
LEGISLATORS.
He Is Confident That Sixty-One Re- :
publicans Are Ready to Enter
a Caucus on the Sen
atorship.
"I am convinced thai if the members of
the Legislature were convened in exUa i
session to-morrow sixty-one Republicans, '
without party pressure or manipulation, :
would go â¢to caucus to settle th Senat r
ship."
Judgo Dibble made the foregoing asser
tinji yesterday, and remarked that he was
willing to be quoted.
"I have no authority," he resumed, '"to
speak for any other person, and do not
know what views Governor Gage enter- â 
tains regarding the topic- 1 have not dis
cussed the question with him, but have
canvassed it with many members of the
legislature who have visited the city dur- '
ing the past m< nth. I have not seen one I
v. ho does not believe thai an extra ses
sion should be called. I do not know i
ivh.cre The Call get.s its Information re- j
bpectlng the impediments m me way of ;
\Â»ie proposed extra session, but II tne ;
{taper is guessing some good guess work is â 
Leiug done.
â¢ 11 is my judgment," continued â ' udge i
Dibble, ''thiit ihÂ«- question ol the Senator- ,
t.iap snouia he .setueu this year, in Octo- â¢
lier or November. The dispute should not ,
Le projected ir.to the next political cam- :
] ;iit;n. \\ r.en the memLieis ol the Legis- j
jaiure went home after tailing to till tile â 
\aoancy in the United States senate their i
coiistliuer.ts assailed them wim this 1:1- 1
qiary: :\Vby in â  did you not elect a. \
teriatorV "j'hc members were not a-sked
way they did not elect Barnes, Utt,
t-.ia.nt or burns, but why they did not j
t-ifct a Senator.
â¢it is auc mat 1 have -â  en many mem
"burs <>t the Assembly and Senate, recently.
Several of tnem caned at my office For
example, Senator Smith of Kern remarked j
ti.ai ne was ready to go into caucus. i !
a. so understand that Assemblyman Me- I
lionaid of Tuolumne is willing to enter j
a .caucus."'
judge Dibble was asked if he had ;;d-
Vlsed Prank Brandon, secretary of trie
Senate,- to prepare for an extra session, i
Heplylng to the question he said:
"X'our impression that 1 so advised Sec- j
retary Brandon is not correct. I 'erhups
he obtained this advice or suggestion from j
some other member.
"It is my opinion, based on Interviews i
-with members of the Legislature,^ repeat- |
ed Judge Dibble^ "that sixty-one Re.pr.-i- |
JUans are ready, in the event of an extra j
session, to enter a caucus. Other Repuh- .
licans would go in to protect their inter? j
Â« *ts, and therefore eighty-nine mem i
would participate. l cannot say when the j
extra session will be convened, or whether
the Governor will call it. I can only ex- i
press my judgment that there should be j
an extra session and the Quicker the |
question of the Senatorshin is settled UiÂ« i
better it will be for the Republican party j
and the State."
Governor Gage arrived in the city Sun- â 
day morning, and there is no doubt that I
lip was advised of the progress made by
Burns In extra session solicitation. It is j
not to be presumi-d that Judge Dibble will
tell The Call of political deals ar.d in- I
trigues behind the scenes. It Is known j
that Gag* 1 protests against being made;
the laughing stock of the State. He knows !
quite well that he would bo held up to j
ridicult, derision and hatred If an extra j
session called by him should become dead- j
locked on the torship. He demands i
therefore that members shall declare in ;
black and white that they mean business !
and not nonsense.
The caucus talk is as plainly In the in- ;
terest of the Mexican now as "it was dur-;
ing the regular session of the Legislature.
Since U. S. Grant and General Barnes j
have renounced Senatorial aspirations. I
and since Irving M. Scott has turned his I
thoughts to the Mayoralty under the new I
charter, the followers of Burns are con- '.
lid en t of controlling the caucus.
Apart from all political considerations,
the members or' the Legislature, without
regard to party, arc extremely anxious to
get on the pay roll of the State and be in
position to place dependent relatives and I
friends on the same beautiful roll.
Onoe enrolled the whole delectable crew |
would smile at the gullible Governor and i
"point with pride" to the superior genius j
rif the Mexican. Judge Carpenter and I
Stephen M. White have told Gage to
"look out."

being unable to Bleep, started to walk
around the hotel grounds, but had not

an â¢ rnbankment a distance of some
twenty feet.
It was a half hour before he was dis
covered and brought to the hotel, where
it was found that he had broken his col
lar-bone and three ribs and had also
sprained his wrist. He was sent home
c and will be confined to his bed ibr
some time. Sergeant Campbell is con

Harry F. Emeric Very lill.
The report oomos from San Pablo that I
Hurry F. Emetic, formerly Statf Kish and
Game Commissioner, is seriously ill at hi a
home there. He has been sufOrinÃ from
a complication of complaints, and tl;
malady being serious his recovery Is con
sidered doubtful. Mr. Emerlc married a '
Miss Barbier. Several years ago, fearing ;
that he would not recover from an ill
ness, he deeded all of his largo e.=tate to
his wife, who in turn deeded it to her i
sister. Myrtle, and thpn died. Miss Bar- I
bier bitterly resisted Mr. Emeric's efforts
to recover the property until recently, i
when the case was compromised. Mr. i
Krneric is the owner of the beautiful San
f'.iblo ranch, which he stocked with all
klnda of game and fish.
Holy Cross Church Altar.
The meeting- of the Marble Cutters' and
Finishers' I'nioji last nnti tt r ht was devoted
to -i dUacussfoa over the importation of
a marble altar for Holy Cross Catholic
Church. The upshot of the discussion
was that all organized labor unions were
forbidden to work on the church so long
as the church authorities shall persist in
having the altar, which was cut, dressed
and finished in Italy, put in its place. A
circular letter was sent to all united labor
organizations in which the above facts
were set out and requesting that for the
present no work be done on the church
by union labor.

of the boys proposed a swim. Two or
three of them stripped and went Into the

possible. Osborne laughed at them and
struck oui Into the bay. Suddenly he
was seen to throw up his arm? and sink.
The boys on the wharf and the men on

they were soon undeceived when he did

drawing sufficiently to send the ship through the water at a five or six knot gait. Following her is a tug
which expects to get a job when th" wind falls light. Several fishing smacks are hurrying in with a good

for some foreign port. It is the must faithful picture of the Golden Gate of the present day ever painted, and should

could to their drowning companion. One
of them dived after him, but was seized
with cramps and it was only with the
greatest difficulty that he was kept
afloat until the boat came. They all got
safely into the craft and the sailors then
began grappling for the body of Osborne.
but failed to find it. The chances are
that the tide caught the body soon after
the lad went down and carried it toward
Red Rock. a ,
Captain Martin was notified and went
at once to Port Costa. All of yesterday
boats from the various vessels lying at
Port Costa were out looking for the re
mains, but no trace of the body could be
found. Osborne was a great favorite
with everybody on the Glenard- and his
sudden death has thrown a gloom over
the whole ship.
The transport St. Paul sailed for Puget
Sound yesterday. She took away about
150 recruits and at Seattle will load horses
and a detachment of cavalry for Manila.
The transport Senator will sail to-day
with 650 recruits, a signal corps and a
numner of officers. The sailors on the
Senator were jubilant yesterday. Their
pay was advanced from $30 to $40 a month.
There are three rates of wages for sail
ors on different transports. Thus the
men on the Pacific Mall steamers and
those on the Indiana. Ohio and Pennsyl
vania are paid $30; the men on the Lee
lanaw, Sheridan and some others of
Uncle Sam's vessels get $35, while the
Alaska Commercial Company and the
Pacific Coast Steamship Company pay $40
a month: The St. Paul shipped her crew
on Saturday at $10, and when Goodall,
Perkins & Co. heard of it they at once
ordered that the men on the Senator get
$40 a month also. Hence the jubilation
among the sailors on the Senator.
The auxiliary cruiser Badger went to
Mare Island for an overhauling yester
day. She will be back in the .-stream about
the end of the month and on September
1 will start out for an eight days' cruise
with the Naval Battalion.
There are tons of fruit on Jackson
street wharf going to waste. The can
neries cannot handle any more and the
farmers are still sending it down the
river in boatloads.' There are hundreds
of boxes and baskets of plums, peaches
and pears going to waste because nobody
wants them. If the Almshouse, City and
County Hospital or any of the charitable
institutions want a wagon load of fruit
all they have to do is to send a wagon
with a properly accredited representative
to McDonough & Runyon, commission
merchants, 408 Davis street, and they will
get an order for all the fruit they can
pack away.
A cable from London states that rein
surance on the overdue British ship Mac
duff has advanced to 50 per cent. The
Macduff is due at Astoria from Calcutta,
and the grain sacks with which she is
loaded are badly needed for this season's
crops.
Beadle Bros.' new steamer Aberdeen
will have her trial trip to-day. She has

DR. McLAY'S DEATH.
St. Andrew's Society Determined to
Investigate It.
The St. Andrew's Society met last night
at Scottish Hall on Larkin street to take
action on the death of Dr. McLay. who
was a member of the society and who
is said to have died of a broken heart due
to severe criticism placed upon him by
the Hoard of Health.
Andrew "Wilkie, in an eulogistic speech,
described McLay as being not only a
clever surgeon, but a man who was al
ways willing to assist the poor.
"It seems an outrage," he tenderly re
marked "that a sifted and honored man
like our dead member should be so severe
ly criticized and even murderedâ yes,
murdered by gossip. I believe in the free
dom of speech as well as of the press, but
I do not propose to stand by and see a
fellow-member assaulted by the foul
tongue of slander."
Bar. Wilkie was followed by John Rfid,
who, after praising the virtues of the de
ceased moved that a committee be ap
pointed to thoroughly investigate the cir
cumstances attending his death. The mo
tion was received with applause, ''hair
man Webster In a short speech declared
that Inasmuch Â»* Dr. McLay has beer.
ndered he thought that the
eonim lid confer with the mem
bers of the medical profession with a view

cer haJ the power to condemn a doctor
who was only doing his duty. The com
mittee will report at the next meeting, nt
which time the true facts in the matter
will be made public.

BURGLAR GAGS
AND DRUGS A
LITTLE GIRL
Daylight Robbery in
Oakland.
BLAKE BLOCK RANSACKED
ETHEL ROBERTS THE MISCRE
ANT'S VICTIM.
She Fights Desperately With the
Thief, but Is Overpowered and
Forced to Drink a Sleep
ing Potion.
OAKLAND. Alii?. 14.â A broad daylight
I burglary, to tho boldness of which is add
e brutal gauging Of a little 10-year
-1 old girl, and committed In the heart of
the city last Friday afternoon, was re
ported to the police to-night, and Detect
ive Holland, who was immediately de
tatled to work on the cane, regards it as
one of the boldest jobs of its kind ever
perpetrated here. The matter was not re
ported until this evening because of dread
ed notoriety.
Mrs. A. Roberts and her little daughter,
Ethel, occupy room 42 on the second floor
of the Blake block, on Washington street,
between Eleventh and Twelfth, and on
last Friday afternoon between 5 and f>
o'clock they planned a stroll about town.
When they rcficiied the ground floor Mrs.
Roberts nent the child back to the room
to get the poetoffice key. Ethel had no
sooner unlocked the door and stepped in
side the room than a tall man, neatly
dressed in a black cutaway suit and derby
! hat. rushed in after her, threw her upon
the bed and before she could make any
i outcry stuffed a piece of silk cloth and
I dress lining into her mouth. The child
â  fought desperately and kicked her assall
i ant In the race, but he easily overpowered
; her. He then poured some red liquid.
probably a sleeping potion, from a small
bottle into her mouth, and she became
unconscious.
Mrs. Roberts found the door unlocked,
j and on entering was horrified to find her
child lying on the bed unconscious and
i gagged. The gag was promptly removed
i from the child's mouth, a physician called
and the little one was finally relieved.
Articles from the bureau drawers were
found strewn about the room, but thus
i far Mrs. Roberts has not missed an arti
i cle of any value, for she wore her jewelry
; at the time and also had all of her money
| in a purse in her possession.
The girl had sufficiently recovered to
i day to give a description of her assailant.
! She says the man was of tall and slen
der build, wore a black mustache, had a
receding chin and rather a short neck. On
one of his ringers he wore a diamond ring
and from his gold watch chain was sus
ptnded a large society charm. She had
never seen him before, and says she did
not realize his presence until he slapped
his hands over her mouth. The roboer
evidently left the room very quietly, for
he attracted no attention â  and escaped
without leaving any clew. His coolness
is emphasized By the fact that there is a
janitor in the halls almost constantly who
would doubtless have noticed him had the
robber made any commotion In hurrying
from the building. The police are entirely
\ in the dark as to the Identity of the bold
i burglar. _____^_______

MATTHEWS WHIPS KERWIN
Chicago Man Shows Himself to Be a
Glutton for Punishment.
NEW YORK, Aug. 14.â At the Coney
Island Sporting Club to-night Matty Mat
thews beat George Kerwin of Chicago
from the start to the finish, which was
reached in the sixteenth round, when th,-;
Chicago man's second threw up the
sponge after their man had taken enough
punishment to make any three men stop
before that time. Kerwln's gameness is
unquestioned. Matthews was ten pounds
heavier than Kerwin.
Matthews swung rights and lefts on his
opponent's bead and body and ripped his
left to the wind with terrific force, but
Kerwin was always on deck and sent
back right swings which puzzled Mat
thews. In the fifth round Matthews
floored his antagonist three times, and it
seemed dollars to peanuts that Kerwin
â would not survive another round. Round
after round they banged away, with Mat
thews landing six blows to Kerwln's one.
In the thirteenth Matthews actually
beat his man to the floor with right
swings over the kidneys. Kerwin regained
his feet as the bell ended the round, and
came up groggy but thoroughly game for
the fourteenth, Matthews opened this
with a left punch on the face, which
forced Kerwfn to the floor. George was
> up again in three seconds, but was sent
back once more with a right swing on
the head. This time he took nine seconds
to get up and by sheer pluck lasted out
the round. Matthews hammered his man
at will throughout the fifteenth round,
but despite some fearful punishment Ker
win was game to the core, and although
he could not send back a good blow he
was still on his feet with the bell.
The end came in the sixteenth, when
Kerwin was put to the floor with a right
swing. When George was down his sec
onds threw up the sponge, but Kerwin
was on his feet and begged to be allowed
to continue. He was forced to his corner
and Matthews was declared the winner.
Otto Seiloff of Chicago defeated Hardy
Lemmons (colored) of Buffalo In lour
rounds.

FAIR CASE REARGUED
Supreme Court Justices Listen to
More Law Upon Trusts.
A year ago tho trust features of tho Fair
will case were argued at length before the
Supreme Court on appeal from the deci
sion and judgment of Judge Slack, who
had heard the case in the Superior Court.
The higher tribunal has given the â â ;Â« â <â¢
much attention and many consultations
of the Justices have been held upon the
complex and perplexing points involved.
At last the Justices agreed to disagree
until such time as more suggestions us to
law and fact could be presented by tho
legal lights interested for the several par
ties involved. , Â
The reargument of the case came up
before the Supreme Court In bank yesti r
,\a\ judge R. Y. Hayne and William
Pierson appeared and represented the
trustees Attorneys Crothers, Goodfel
low Angus and Judge Van K. Paterson
appeared for the minor heirs, children of
Mrs Oelrichs. The children of the de
ceased millionaire were represented by
Charles E. Wheeler and Judge John Gar
'iii his argument Judge Hayne attacked
the decision of Superior Judge Slack, con
tending that it was erroneous and that
â¢he trust made by Fair was valid and
permissible under the laws of this State
Attorney Wheeler contended that the,
trust was void and that Fair had no power
to alienate his property, as set forth in
his win. The argument lasted until late
in the afternoon. The decision will bo
rendered later. .;â¢ '"

PERRAULT ROSE
TO A QUESTION
OF PRIVILEGE
Scored Statements of
Sheehan.
SUPERVISORS HEAR PROTESTS
VARIOUS CITY DEPARTMENTS
ASK FOR MORE MONEY.
Street Superintendent Fragley Af
forded Some Relicf â City Sup
plies Cannot Be Pur
chased Monthly.
Dr. Pf-rrault rose to a question of
privilege yesterday when the Supervisors
came together, and denounced as rank
misstatement a Btory which appeared in
the Examiner of Sunday concerning the
office of Tax Collector Sheehan and the
political differences alleged to exist be
tween him and the Supervisor. Mr.
Sheehan registereu an energetic kick be
cause of the refusal of the Supervisors
to allow him $1500 additional in the tax
levy for extra clerk hire, and alleged that
Perrault, aa chairman of the Finance
Committee, was acting as the agent of
Crimmins and Kelly. This Perrault de
nied yesterday, and Sheehan. expecting
a well-served-up roast, did not appear.
Instead he was represented before the
board by Gavin McNab and Morris M.
Bs'tee, also by his chief deputy, Tom
Hagan. The attorneys announced that
they had come in to talk over the $1500
proposition, but Perrault headed them off
with an inquiry as to whether or no they
were prepared to stand tor the truth of
the matter given the Examiner by Shee
han. They admitted they were not. and
finally gave up the (on entirely and re
tired. There were a number of other
county officials on hand to argue again
for a raise in the amounts allowed their
several offices under the tax levy, but the
board took no action except In the cane
of the Street Department. Superintendent
Fragley reported that the Sixth-street
sewer system was so badly clogged that
the health of the entire district south of
Folsorn street was menaced and said he
would need $10,000 a 1 least to put it in
working order. A resolution was adopted
making that amount of his tax appor
tionment Immediately available. Joseph
Goddard was present aa the representa
tive of County <Me!k Deane, and Presi
dent Crockett of the gas company came
in With C C <!. Miller, also of the com
pany, to mnke a personal request for an
increase of 56000 in the gas fund.
Supervisor Byington's anti-turntablp or
dlnance came up for final action, but on
n of AigeltinÃer was laid ov*r for
week In order that the representatives
. r the several street railways might have
time to present their side of the case.
\ communication from the residents of
Kentucky street stated that the Market-
Btreet Railway Company was taking out
die iron electric poles along that
thoroughfare and substituting in theii
plaee wooden ones, which by no means
enhanced the beauty of the district. A
resolution was adopted denying the right
of the company to proceed and ordering
!t to return the iron poles already taken
The Gaa Inspector said ho could save
$200 per month in City Hall gas bills alone
if ho were given the right to go ahead.
The right was granted him. Supervisor
Collins reported that he had expended
$525 In repairing the Central Receiving
Hospital and that it was in better con
dition than it had ever been. Dr.Coffey
of the Board of Health and Dr. Lawlor,
the Health Officer, reported upon the
frishtful condition of the City and County
Hospital and also said that while the
Supervisors had provided In the levy tor
salaries for attaches at the Harbor Hos
pital no allowance had been mad- for
bandages and medicines. They asked the
board to take some action.
Cty and County Attorney I,ane was
Instructed to take what proceedings hi?
judgment should dictate to assure an
early completion of tho Hall of Justice.
The architects reported that the budding
could not be opened by September 1. The
board also approved the action of the
architects In contracting with Canill &
Hale for four elevators in the flail Ol
Justice and Morgue, buildings at a cost
Â;â¢ $13,300 It was decided that the speci
fications authorised the architects to seg
regate the work and invite proposals
Fin- Commissioner Boyd was granted a
leave of absence for sixty days and As
sessor Podge was authorized to expend
$3000 in August for extra deputies. .
Cty and County Attorney T.ane sub
mitted an opinion which agreed with that
Âf Auditor Wells in that the Board of
Supervisors may not create a commission
to prosecute any public work, but may
appoint cither an engineer or an architect.
Mr 1 ane's op nion was called out by the
action of Auditor W*lls in holding up the
claims of the sewer commission on the
eround that that body was Mescal and the
nroposed issue of bonds would be inval
idated if the commission were not legally
Mr lane ' s.-i id that wnile ho did not
think the bonds would be rendorod in
valid he thought It would be best to fol
low the strict letter of the law in. order
that no question could ever he raised.
By a v>te of seven to five the ordinance
recently adopted upon the advice of the
Merchants' Association which required all
<-itv supplies to be bought monthly in tho
open market upon proposals submitted by
reputable merchants was repealed. The
resolution to repeal was offered by At
tridge, who said that under the new sys
tem it was impossible to buy perishable
Mods needed at the City and County
Hospital in emergency cases.
Postoffice receipts.
The toss receipts of the San Francisco
Postofflce for the fiscal year ended June
â¢!0 were $1,002,470. as against $920,337 for the
year 1897-98. It is the first time in the
history of the office that the million dollar
mark has been reached. The late war
with Snain the presence of thousands or
American soldiers in the Philippines and
the Keneral industrial bnnrovenw'nt In
the country are given as the reasons for
the increase. _

GREEN TELLS A TALE OF
MURDER AND MYSTERY
Brands "Plunger" Hill the Swin
dler of the Century,
In Three Warrants the Australian Is
Charged With Felonies That in Two
Years Profited Him $150,000.
AUGUSTUS HOWARD, thÂ« "Australian Plunger," is no longer
a mystery. He is an escaped convict from Sydney, whose
real name is Charles 3>oyle, a forger and a fugitive from justice.
Chief of Police Lees and W> E. Green, the Denver millionaire. How
ard's erstwhile partner, brand him as a would-be murderer, with
Green as the intended victim. Warrants for his arrest for swind
ling Green out of $150,000 have been In the possession of the
police since Saturday, but were being: held up pending the arrival
of the next steamer from Australia, which is due here on thÂ«
27th of this month with requisition papers for Howard from the
Australian authorities. Howard got wind of his intended arrest and
is supposed to be on his way to Mexico, if he is not already
there.

Howard is probably making extraordinary
efforts to get out of reach of Chief Le^a'
detectives. So far from ordering Green
to "shake down" Howard, Chief Lees has
been patiently preparing a grand coup
â which was to culminate In landing How
ard behind the bars with the net of evi
dence enveloping him so thoroughly that
escape would be impossible.
Grand larceny, obtaining money by false
pretense, felony embezzlement â these are

Medical Discovery is a medicine composed
of native medicinal roots that do no vio-

natural. It simply promotes the natural
processes of secretion and excretion. It
restores the lost appetite, corrects all dis-
orders of the digestion, makes the assimi-
lation of the food perfect, invigorates the
liver, purifies and enriches the blood,
builds new and healthy flesh tissue, tones
the nerves and gives sweet and refreshing
sleep. It is the great blood-maker and
flesh-builder. It cures 98 per cent, of all
cases of all diseases of the air passages that
lead up to consumption. It is a wonderful
medicine for all diseases due to insufficient
or improper nourishment of body or nerves.

uree you to take worthless substitutes for
the sake of a few pennies added profit. .

the barges upon which the warrants are
based. The first of the complaints, all of
which nrÂ» sworn to by Mr. (irei-n. is built
upon a charge of grand larceny. It states
that on or about the Ist day of November,
IS9R, one Charles Doyle, alias Mason, alias
Bowyer, alias Godfrey, alias Simms, alias
Osgood. alia.- Lee, alias AugUStU* How
ard, did feloniously â  take and carry away
and convert to his own use money In the
sum of (166,000, the personal property of
WlUard Reed Green.
The second set? forth that on or about
the same date Charles Doyle and his nu
merous aliases did by false pretense se
cure to his own use and purpose the sum
I of 1150,000. also the property of Green.
The complaint recites that on November
1 Doyle, or Howard, represented to Green
: that he was the owner of and had power
to sell a certain mine ledge known as
Gray's shale beds, situated in New South
Wales, Australia, running: from Lapstone
i Hill across Govetts Leap to the head of
I Bathurst Plains, and approximately 137
miles in length, and sixty odd miles wide,
and that he could deliver a good and suffi
cient title.
That upon this showing Green advanced
the money to make the purchase, but upon
further investigation found that Howard
was not nor ever had been the owner of
the property. The third complaint dates
back to October 1, 1897, a year and a
month prior to the first two charges. The
crime alleged Is the felony embezzlement
of the sum of $13,000 by Howard whilo
acting as agent for Green. . .
Chief Lees had cabled to Australia to
have extradition papers for Howard for
warded, and he was expecting these on
the next steamer. Until that time he en
deavored to keep the fact of his contem
plated arrest of Howard a secret. A |
hint dropped, however, spoiled his plan,
and Howard Is now believed to be on his
way to Mexico via Stockton. That he will
be ultimately captured, however, seems
to be a certainty.
So far from "shaking down" Howard in
the interest of Mr. Green, the Chief has
Pimply been holding off for the opportune
moment. Mr. Green has recovered $58,000
from Howard, but the police had no part
In forcing the latter to disgorge.
In the rooms of. Mr. Green's attorney,
E. S. Plllsbury, in the Palace Hotel last
night, the former made a statement of
his dealings, with Howard which was sup
plemented by another from the lips of
Chief Lees, who accuses Howard of be
in* not only an embezzler and a thief,
but a would-be murderer. Detective Torn
Gibson and Officer Ellis were also, present.
Mr. Pillsbury made the following brief
preliminary statement:
, Mr. Green came here In September, 1597, on
other business and met Howard, who repre
sented hlir.vlf to be a Cnr>tain in the English
j navy, but that Tie had l.^n severely wounded
: at the bombardment of Alexandria and was on
leave on that account. Soon after they 'met
Howard appeared dresser] in the uniform of I
a British -naval officer and wearing: numerous
decorations claimed to have been received for
meritorious conduct. Howard then opened up
a new plan for making pas from borax, shale,
lime. etc."; claiming that by this process pas.
could be made for a very low price. Howard
got Green interested and informed him that
l'Â» also had a secret process for making; this
Eas, and also told him that he was the in
ventor of a ft earn engine which could be
operated at a great saving for utilizing: com
bustion of fuel. Mr. Green Interested himself
in Howard and these matters. After this things
wont on for a While, Howard representing to
Mr. Green that In order to successfully manu
facture the ira? it was desirable to have a
chale bed In Australia which his. brother
owned: that this shale was the best In the
world for the manufacture of this can, and
j If Mr. Green would, advance the money he
(Howard) would go to Australia and negotiate
for the purchase of the same. Howard showed
Green a number of cables from his sister
whose name, he said, was Agnes Faul, tending
to show that his brother owned these lands*.
Mr Green then advanced $13,000 for the pur
pose of making the purchase.
Mr. Green then dictated the following:
He arrived in Australia about the end of No
vember. 1897. He cabled that he had located
hiÂ» brother who owned the land, and that he
was willing to sell it. but demanded an in
creased price, which was Â£25,000, and requested
my assent to the purchase at that price. I
stated that the price wa**too high, and ad
vised dropping the matter, and suggested that
we wait a while, as the land could probably
be purchased more advantageously later.
Shortly after this I received several cables '
from him on other matters. Finally I received
a cable stating; he had purchased the land for
Â£80,000 ($150,000). and had borrowed additional

WITH bis head resting? on the
whlffletree of his wagon and
his feet on a level with the
seat, the body of Joseph .T. Im- '
sand, plugged with buckshot,
â was found early yesterday morning h â¢
few hundred yards from the White
House, Colma. That a brutal murder
was committed there can be no doubt,
and the authorities have fastened their
suspicions upon a colored family by '
the name of Mitchell, who are the
neighbors of Imsand and who have â 
quarreled from time to time with the ,
deceased. ,
Imsand was a hog rancher, owning
less than an acre of land along the
creek which runs to the west of Col- '
ma, and about a half-mile distant from '
the county road. Directly above his â¢
place is the home of the Mitchells,
whose bellicose tendencies have pro
voked more than one quarrel in Col
ma, and whose threats have terrified
the entire community in and about
that little town. Several months ago
a dispute arose between Imsand nd
"William Mitchell Jr. over the boundary
line which separates their respective
hog ranches. The pistol was resorted
to, and Mitchell now wears the marks
of- combat in the shape of a scar on
Ills left cheek. Since that time the
feud has steadily grown more bitter,
and the belief of the residents for miles
around is that yesterday's murder was
its culminating episode.
Not many weeks ago the entire Im
sand family was poisoned by drinking
water from the creek, which flows
through the land of the Mitchells to
the Imsand ranch. It was only by the
timely aid of a physician that their
lives were saved. This crime the Im
sands declare to have been perpetrated
by the negro family. The present Mrs.
Mitchell is a white woman, and she
has made herself a veritable harpy
to the entire neighborhood, threatening
all who have crossed her ways with
utter extermination.
Imsand left his home about 3:30
o'clock yesterday morning, bound for
San Francisco, where he was to gather
swill for his hogs. The trail of his
wagon's wheels can be followed to the
corner of First avenue and Market
street, where the murder was undoubt
edly committed. Slight wounds from
a few buckshot tore the flesh on the
right side of his face, but the mortal
blow was dealt after this. Three shots "
which went through his left shoulder
and lodged in his lungs are what
caused death. vii
Two distinct shots were fired ac
cording to the testimony of many peo-
illllll
%L notary in accordance with the Torrens
mmmm
dence of his statements.

nue Sheriff Mansfield found a shot
gun cartridge that -bore evidences of
recent use and a freshly charred cart
ridge wad. The wagon with the body
was discovered a block away jammed
up against a tree and fence on Second
avenue, one block nearer Imsand's
home and in the opposite direction
from his course of travel. Whether
Imsand turned when first shot and
drove backward, being caught again
by the murderer when he reached Sec
ond avenue, or whether both phots
were fired Invquick 'succession arid the
horse of his own accord attempted to
return home Is a matter over which
the police are now conjecturing.'
Sheriff Mansfield, as soon as he
heard of the murder, drove to the
scene and made a hasty Investigation.
He went to the Mitchell ranch for the
purpose of arresting the entire family.
William Mitchell was not at home, but
Dave and William Jr. were on the .
premises and they were apprehended
and lodged in the Colma jail, from
which they were afterward removed to
Redwood City. At a late hour in the
evening the search for the senior
Mitchell was. still continuing. His wife
said that he had gone to San Fran
cisco to attend to some business af
fairs.
Imsand bore a good reputation in
Colma and was known as a peaceable
rancher who worked from morning to
night without disturbing his neigh
bors. He was married and had rive
children, all of whom are far below
the age of self-pupport. Mrs. Imsand

that he had business pending with other peo
ple from which he would realize large sums
of money and that he would shortly make me
some payments.
PMsbury..Will you please make a statement.
Mr. Green, about any attack that Mr. How
i ard made upon you personally?
Greenâ L'pon my return to San Francisco 1
i was Informed by various people that, during
j my abseme in Australia, Howard had been
1 to them and made varirius statements, the oh
: ject of which eeemed to be to have them re
pÂ»-HtÂ»Â»d to me and the purport of which WM
that I was about to return to America: that I
would be In a great state of indignation, us
I would not have found the lands as he haJ
represented, and that, in all probability, I
would be in for a fight; that he was ready for
a fight and, l<i fact, desired one; that he had
armed hlmseir with all sorts of weapons
against me, and that he had manufactured flc
! ti'tious evidence against me. which he pro
p.B<Â«'l to use if I made any attempts to prose-
I cute him. â¢ ,
PiUstmryâ You learned after you came bad:
from Denver that he had hired men to make
away with you on your way to Australia.
Plltgburyâ Didn't you learn that the night be
fore you left he was down here in the court
yard of the Palace with two men in a hack
to whom he paid $0000 apiece to do you up on
| the dock?
Greenâ That was arranged the night of th?
! calling of the steamer Alameda, the Ed of
July last I was to be murdered on the dock.
The steamer should have sailed at 10 o'clock on
the evening of that day. but owing to the n.m
arrlval of the English mail she postponed her
! departure until the early hours of the following
morning, lmring this time I was on the dock.
I talked with Howard, expecting him to com
plete his preparations to sail by that boat.
i Earlier In the evening, Howard, as I have since
learned had people at his house, where I was
in the evening, and at-the Palace Hotel later
in the night, for the purpose of seeing and
! identifying me. These people were to meet
and murder me. To these people he had paid
fBWO apiece and they were to receive afterward,
or did receive, the balance of $2i},000 for raur
; lierlng me. aa Howard supposed, between here
' and Honolulu.
t'pon returning- to America end talking
! with Howard and taxing him with his decep-
I tlons and frauds upon me. he stated that he
hoped there would be no trouble over it. He
j Â»aid that if any attempts were made to cause
him trouble or to take proceedings against him
ho wanted me to understand that he was per
fectly well oetablished here and. in his own
language, "waa set up to meet anything that
1 could be brought against him." This meant
that he was under the protection of officers of
the law both the police and the courts; and
that he had detective* R"d others in his pay
ar.d thnt th^re were various public officials and
politicians upon whom he could rely for pro
tection and immunity: ami that nothing could
tie dene here to his Injury: also that he had in
fluence with some of the newspapers and that
If I started anything against him I would be
j besmirched in every direction.
I also, after my return to Pan Francisco,
I heard that Howanfl lia'l made iirrangements
| upon several occasions to have me murdered;
! and that he had particularly made such ar
i rangements to have me put out of the way,
both on the evening of my departure for Aos
-1 tralia in March and also while en route on
board the Alameda.
Detective Gibsonâ Howard got nne of Kelly's
| hacks driven by John Fltzpatrick nnd one of
the Kelly boys on the seat, and they started
1 down to the Pala.-e H<tel. First they went to
I a certain bank on Market street and took $20.
--000 out of a nafa deposit box. They then drove
to the courtyard of the Palace Hotel and had
these men in the hack to throw Green over
board. When they got into th>> courtyard of
the Palace the blinds were drawn down on
the hack windows This man Kelly had taken
the t^.OOO previously into a saloon and handed
Howard $5000 of It. After waiting around
there several hours the hack was driven down
to the Alameda wharf. When they got down
there a mar. named Ed Coffman. a witness In
the Foster case stepped up to Howard and
told him he had a warrant for his arrest in
the Foster case; this warrant was "phony."
i Howard made the excuse to Green that he had
to go away. He went to the hack and handed
these men !n the hack $5000. There was some
dispute over the money. It seems that the
men in the hack were to receive $20,000.
Detective Gibson's story was to the ef
fect that the warrant for Howard was an
excuse for him not to sail on the Ala- !
meda with Green, who, he afterward told i
George Adams, had put up a plot with a
man named Mitchell to murder him on

of Mitchell senior has a suspicious
color and Sheriff Mansfield is hot on
tliÂ»> search f<>r the old man.
Tno Mitchell menage and Imsand
have !>âº(â¢:) at war for three years. Last
April a genuine battle with guns was
fought out over tli^ boundary line be
tween their ranches. Latterly the
courts have been called to decide a
property contention In which the two
were concerned and Imsand won the
case. Since that episode of the feud
the Mitchells have threatened to drive
Imsand out of the country.
Wifen the officers searched Mitchell's
house yesterday a pii-iol. shotgun and
rille were found on tii" premises. The
weapons were carried to Redwood
City, the county seat.
The body was discovered by Fred
Snider at about 5 in the morning and
not many minutes after the news
ppre;Ml like wildfire through the town.
No other subject was discussed in
Colma yesterday and there was some
talk of lynching among the loiterers
on the county road rtaort.
"William Mitchell Sr., the one who
is strongly suspected by Sheriff Mans
field of the commission of the crime,
was caught last night while entering
the Alcazar building to attend a meet
ing of the colored Masons. Sheriff
Mansfield and Detective Ryan located
him and made the arrest. Mitchell
was booked at the City Prison,
where his wife visited him. She said
that he left Colma Saturday evening
and was Hying at 158 Fifth street

true state of the case.
The n ; en got Howard's money and then,
to use the detective's expression, pro
ceeded to give him the double cross."
One of them sailed with Green on the
Alameda, the other two pretended to
do so.
After the arrival of the steamer from
Honolulu, Gibson says, the men reported
to Howard that the deed was done, got
their money and went to Chicago.
These two men and the one that sailed
with Green are known to the police and
i are expected in this city at any time.
: I'ntil that time comes their names will
not be divulged. These are the same
men who stood up the Wells-Fargo Bank

Augustus Howard, alias Charles Mason
alias Bowyer, alias Godfrey, alias Doyle
alias aims, is an escaped Australian
convict. While under committal for trial
on a charge of forgery he (scaped from
the Braldwood jail, in Australia this
i king-pin bunko man has a sentence of
i twenty-five years hanging over his head
His rici.nl aa an Australian nook to
gether with bis picture were forwarded to
Chief Lees by the Australian authorities
According to the description given in the
document Howard is a native or America
or London and he was burn in 1566.
Ho arrived In the colonies in 1879 where
Ihe professed to be an engineer. He was
| first arrested by the Central police in
I Sydney on July 20, 1883. on two charges
of stealing. He served a term of five
months, and on being released he grew
too handy with the pen and was arrested
on two charges of forgery and three
charges of gaining money under false pre
tenses. For these crimes Howard was
sentenced to five years' imprisonment
His sentence was subsequently reduced
and on gaining his freedom the' rascal at
tempted to carry on his nefarious busi
ness again. On April 12, ']SSB. he was ar
! rested on several charges of gaininK
money under false pretenses, and sen
tenced to serve another term of 'five
years.
On July 22 Howard escaped and the
Australian authorities had given him up
for dead until Chief Lees wrote to (hem
| requesting the above record of his crim
inal life in the colonies.
In addition to having a startling crim
inal record In Australia Howard is not
unknown to the local police
Detective Tom Ellis, win. assisted Chief
Lees to work up the ease against How
ard, arrested him on January 17 1597 on
a charge of obtaining money under false
pretenses. At that time Howard was
manipulating his Acetyline gas scheme on
Sacramento street. One of his many
dupes, J. H. Blakeway of in First street
swore to the complaint, which was sub
sequently dismissed.
During the time Howard operated in this
city and Oakland he bunkoed fully twrntv
people, Borne of whom he subsequently
paid back to avoid arrest. After gettine
his first money from Green, Howard made
a trip to Honolulu. He returned from the
islands in IKH7-, and practiced deception on
L. Peterson of 226 Market street for the
sum of $30. Shortly after he bunkoed A
J. Starbird, corner of Spear and Market
streets, out of $fioo. Dr. Saunders of Ala
meda put faith in Howard's glowing pic
ture of the untold wealth there was |n
his pet gas scheme, and it enst the doctor

ruined Dr. Saunders. ly

the debt Howard, so Chief Lees claims,
had Mrs. Bowel arrested on a charge or
grand larceny. . __,Â«.'
The warrant was sworn out by his wtte
under the name of Gertrude Howard, ami
she alleged that Mrs. Bowel stole two
hundred dollars from her room. Ihe ease
came up in the Police Court and was ulti
mately dismissed. George Adams who
figured prominently in many of Howard s
criminal escapades, ran away from Aus
tralia some years ago with a woman
named Agnes Canary. ,
Previous to meeting the Canary woman ,
Adams, who is an Australian Jew. lived
with a notorious woman nam^d Charlotte
King. He had a son by the King woman,
whom he brought to America. . This chUd
was subsequently turned over to How
ard's wife, who placed the boy in a pri
vate school in this city, where he still
remains. Shortly after arriving in this
city Afinop Canary gave birth to a child.
the offspring of their unnatural in
tlinacy is recorded in the annals of the
Board of Health as the son of George
Walcom Adams. Miss Bessie Lee. who
has posed as a niece of Mrs. Howard, is
said to be her full sister. Her name is
believed by the police to be Straile, and
Â«he is supposed to have been born in
Brisbane. Such is the record of one of
the most remarkable criminals with j
whom the local police have ever had to j
MJ Pillsbury said that Chief Lees had j
told 'him that in order to get the men ;
implicated ir. the Alameda robbery he did j
not desire to arrest Howard immediately, j
Last Saturday things had come to such j
a pass that Mr. Pillsbury came to the con
clusion that the attempt on Green's life !
was in BOtne way mixed up with the mat- <
ter of the robbery, and that he could no ;
longer delay. He also thought that if ar- ;
rested one of the men would turn State's
evidence. and thus the whole matter would i
be brought to light.
Pillsbury therefore notified Lees coat I
he would no longer hold off and proceeded i
to carry his plans into execution. In ex
nlanatioti "oi the affair in the Palace some
(l-i vs ig'> Chief Lees said that the whole
affaii <>f the detectives breaking into the
room was ;ts follows: Gibdbn and Elus
had been detailed on the Alameda rob
bery case and had gone up to see Green in i
his room. Howard had also gone m> io i
see the same party and had got thero I
first The detectives were waiting in *he ,
anteroom when they overheard the start |
of an altercation in the other apartment ,
which gradually grew warmer and
warmer. Finally Green said: I
"Voi have been acting the traitor all
â¢â¢\Vhat are you going to do about it?" j
Howard replied. "You can't do anything
to me in this city. I have the police and
courts fixed. 1 could ruin you with your !
family. Don't you suppose I know an ,
about* your visiting women of the town.
I have a d-n good mind to kill yon right
herp and now; thpn kill myself after
ward. I would do it. too. if it were not
for mv children." .
The 'man's voice was so impassioned
that the officers, fearing he would put his
threat into execution, broke down the
door and interfered.
In explanation of Green's return from
Denver. Chief Lees said that It was made
In compliance with a request sent by him.
Of the $185,000 acquired by Howard Green j
has received $58,000 back, otice by payment
of $6000 and a little later through the pay
ment of $52,000.
Incidentally there seems to be an ex- |
cellent chance of a conflict between the
police and judicial departments before the ,
case is done with.
