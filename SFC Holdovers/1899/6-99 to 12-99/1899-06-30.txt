DAVIS TALKS OF HIS TRIP
IN THE AUTOMOBILE
HIS ROUTE ACROSS THE CONTINENT.
Motor Carriage on a Crowded Street in London.
NEW YORK, Tune 29.â !
Automobilists In this city;
were greatly interested to
day in the announcement that
Mr and Mrs. John D. Davis will
Â.. A from the Herald building
to-morrow in an attempt to make
the run to San Francisco in a I
motor carriage. Doubts were j
Expressed as to the ability of the !
venturesome tourists to over
come the difficulties that they are
certain to encounter, and opin
ions were â â about equally divided

the run is 'â¢successful it. will open \
â the eyes of. French and English
â ;' enthusiasts as to the ability of
Americans. to make automobiles
worthy of consideration.
That it may result in the first
international, race being held in â¢
tin's country was mentioned. as a
possible outcome of the 3700
--mile run. ..â¢.'â â¢ ;'v : '' :
To people west of the Missis
~ippi River the self-propelling
towing cart will be a revelation.
Like the advent of the steam
engine, its progress toward the
petting sun. will cause a sensation..
So far as is known here, no auto-"

mobile has penetrated- the region,
beyond- the Rocky Mountains,
and certainly none has journeyed
by its own power through, the
wilderness.
Mr. Davis regards his trip as
largely a tour of enlightenment.
Besides furnishing dwellers along
the road with an object-les
son as to the possibilities of
American mechanical ingenuity,
Mr. Davis hopes to demonstrate I
to the world the ' feasibility of
touring in private vehicles on
land as one would cruise in a
yacht by sea. Mr. Davis does
not expect to make the wheel I
journey without accident or mis
hap of seme kind, but he is con
fident thai he can overcome all
difficulties. His experiences on
the road; he thinks, will add in
terest to .the trip, and in order I
tliat-.the public may be informed
as to the progress 01 the auto
mobile westward, Mr. and Mrs.
Davis win make stops at the of
fices of the Syracuse Post-Stand- 1
. ard, tlve Buffalo Courier, the
Chicago Times-Herald, the :
Omaha World-Herald, and the
Denver Republican, and will end \
their journey in front of the San :
Francisco Call building!
Mr. Davis' schedule calls for '
ops over night at Albany. Syra- :
cuse, Buffalo, Cleveland, ' Toledo
and Chicago. In. these- cities J
.rests will be made and fresh sup- j;
plies of gasoline secured. Ai 1
careful record will be kept of the
actual running time and mileage -
made, and bulletins will be sent ! '
to the Call-Herald giving the j â¢
The San Francisco Call.
I start and finish of each day's run.
Data in regard to the roads will
be collected, which will be of
value to autoriiobiiists and bi
cyclists for touring purposes in
â  the future.
.Mr. Davis said to-day that he
'expected to make the best time
over the roads in New York
State. "We shall find stretches
of road,"' said he, "over which
we can make twenty to thirty
: miles an hour, but in order tc
avoid accident-, we shall not use
. the fill! speed of the motor except
where, there is a straight road
"I pf ms clear of vehicles. As
the roads will be new to us most
;of the way, and we have the
whole continent to cross and not
<>ne day's run to make, we shall
be mi. .re or less cautious. We
j shall start prepared for emer
gencies and will have an extra
front and rear tire, and we will
al>o carry some duplicate parts
of the motor. 1 have been to the
factory and watched, the' work
men put. a carriage together, so
.that J am familiar with all the
parts of the machinery.
"In addition to the . regular
foot brake, which acts upon the;
rear axle and is sufficient for all
nary emergencies. 1 have bad
a hand brake put on, which oper
ate 011 the tires, and will .stop
the carriage almost instantly and
hold it on any grade. A lever
thrown forward connects the]
gear and starts the carriage for
ward. Speed may lie regulated
at will and the motor can ; be:
-topped or reversed by moving
the lever back. The gasoline
tank is in the bottom of the car
riage and a water jacket sur
rounds the motor and keeps it
, cool.
'Tower comes from the explo
sion of hydro-carbon gas. from
gasoline, and which is ignited by
electricity in the cylinder. Dry
batteries furnish the electricity.
1 shall take four cells, which are
calculated to last 5000 miles. If
the batteries give out it will be
easy \<^ replace them in any city
: through which we pass.
"I expect to reduce speed
: when we get into the foothills pf
, the Rocky Mountains, as the car
riage, with both of us in it and
lour baggage will weigh 1250
pounds. It has a climbing
capacity that will lake us up 2^
}>vr cent grades or better. In
the mountains we shall follow,
;<s far as possible, the old stage
trails to Denver and beyond. We
may go either to the north or to
the south after leaving Denver.
according to what we learn there
of the condition of the passes.
We shall follow the trail outlined
early in the '40's by trappers to

the Palisades we will enter the
foothills of the Sierras and select
the most available pass to cross
that range into California."
A CALIFORNIA WELCOME
FOR THE TRAVELERS
The most elaborate preparations will
be made at the San Francisco end of
the run to welcome Mr. and Mrs. Da
vis after their adventurous trip across
the continent. They will be given a
specimen of genuine California hospi
tality, and will deserve it.
Their trip will bo followed with
keen interest., not alone by the readers
of Th( Can. but by peopfe' all ovei the
United. States and in Europe. The au
tomobile Is the. vehicle of the future, a
future treading: close upon the present.
In the large Eastern cities, in fact, the
motor carriage . has already taken a
place in everyday .street life. Mr. Davis
and his accomplished wife hope to suc
ceed in. demonstrating that the vehicle
i.< as. well adapted for long distances as
for. short. trips. Their success may
mean a measure; of Independence of the
ereal railway companies, far as the:
transportation of passengers is con
cerned,in .the future and with igoqd
roads it may mean full measure; The
trip of .Air. and: Mr?. Davis/ it will bo

GOOD ROADS WILL
FOLLOW THE TRIP
'â¢Hi! -acm. June 29.â The Times-Her
ald /will say editorially to-morrow
morning: "With the roads "f France
it would be a rhost pleasurable under
taking to cross this country from New
fork to jSan Francisco in a motor car
riage, but with the roads of the United
States the samp journey promises much
weariness of the flesh and pertubation
of mind. Mr. and Mrs. John Davis, '
v. h" are to make the trip under the
auspices of the New York Herald and
The San Francisco Call, may
be regarded a? courageous adventurers.
The test for the automobile will be of
the severest kind. There will be moun
tains to climb and descend, rivers to
ford and the.- difficulties of nature will
be but slightly diminished in many
pli Bby paths that are a mockery.
Even In the Kast the highways will be
found diversified with awful mud
holes find forbidding patchwork. At :
certain seasons of the farmers' your
the ancient ruts are only less terrible
than the 'mending.
"Tho conditions, provoke a reasonable
doubt that the carriage will get]
through, bni If it docs It will prove its
own'* title to be considered a useful con
veyance, and iii any event it will per
form, a public service- In-giving a new
Impulse to the .agitation for better
loads. It: may !>â¢â  said that there is no
practical value in such agitation be
cause good roads are attained through
gradual development With an In
crease-, of population there is Increased
neefl of them, and they will come just
at the tiny when it. is demonstrated
that it is more profitable to put in Im
provements than to avoid expenditure.
[n a- thinly settled country combine, j
capital is not sufficient to enable the
people to establish highways through
their wilderness.
"But the tendency is to accept what
we are used to eyi'ii after the necessity
baa passed, and it is this tendency that
blocks public Improvements of all sorts.
In every, case public spirit must bo
aroused by jolting complacent conser
vatism Kith facts, figures and humili

roads- will undoubtedly be hastened by
discussions resulting from just surh en

; command, on the way. to San Fran
cisco, whence they will go to Manila.
The train stopped here and a party
of the negroes raided a saloon near
the station, wracked the bar and shot
the bartender, Chris Deiss. It is
feared that Deiss will die.
The greatest excitement prevailed.
The station was filled with citizens,
and the local authorities held the
train to find the would-be murderer
if possible. . ;
Major Noble, who was in command,
while not recognizing the right of
the local authorities to delay the ex
pedition, consented that the train be
delayed until a thorough search could he
' made. The three companies were or
dered out twice for the inspection, and
the citizens who had been present when
the shooting occurred closely inspected
each man.
But one was identified, Sergeant '
Smith, who gave a satisfactory expla
nation of his presence in the saloon.
At this point a recruit gave out .that '
in daylight he could identify one of the I
men connected with the robbery. Mr.
Van Duzer insisted that the train re
main here until daylight so that the ;
identification cou 'd be made.
Major Noble would not consent to
this. At 12 o'clock the District Attorney
j and the major came to an issue, and j
; the major gave orders to have the train
j start. A writ of attachment was then '
; secured on the local ticket agent pro-

j to leave San Francisco to-morrow night
for the Philippines has been delayed.

ROUGH SEAS AHEAD
FOR ONE CANAL COMPANY
The United States Will Not Permit
Other Governments to Aid
the Enterprise.
WASHINGTON; June 29.â Rough
seas are ahead for the American
isthmus Ship Canat Company, con
trolled by the Grace syndicate, incor
porated on Monday in Trenton, tf jt
tries to obtain aid from a foreign Gov
ernment to construct an isthmian
canal. According u> a high official, no
other Government than the United
States will have anything to do with
the. proposed canal. The papers of in
corporation state that the new com
pany intends to "obtain aid from- the
T'nited States, England, France, Ger
many or any other Government" in its
work.
The State Department has been too
active in seeking to bring about the I
abrogation of the Clayton-Bulwer J
treaty, under which Great Britain has'
an interesi in the canal, to permit that j
or any other foreign government to
have in future anything to do with the
proposed waterway.
It has been reported here that the
Maritime <"anal Company will poo] in
terests with the new isthmus company,
and if so an embarrassing feature of
the canal question will be revived:
The State Department has not been
taking a band in the fight between the j
two concerns, believing it was best to!
let them have it out between them- j
selves; nor wiil it dry so, though the j
Maritime Company, if it does not com- I
bine with the Grace company, may try
to secure from Nicaragua an extension
of its concession after October next, J
the time of the commencement of the \
Eyre-Cragin concessions.
The administration, it is authorita- !
tively stated, will do nothing in canal
matters until the new isthmus com
mission makes its report. At least a
preliminary report is expected from
the commission during the next acs-
Bion of congress, and the President will
make an effort to secure action looking
to the construction "f the canal imme
diately after this report is submitted, i
FOR COLLECTIONS FROM
STREET LETTER BOXES
Automobiles Expected to Be a Great
Improvement Over the Pres
ent Wagons.
WASHINGTON, .hmo 29.â Automobiles
for the collection of mail from street let
ter boxes and for the transportation of
mails to and from railway stations and
steamer wharves are expected to come
into general Use as Minn as their value for
such purposes has been demonstrated.
This wagon service is performed by con
!r:ic:. and tin contractor -In each <"ity in
at- liberty to propel his wagons by. any
motive force he desires, it is believed at
the Postnftier- Department that the pres
ent nigh price of automobiles will tend t'>
retard their general introduction, though,
it is expected there will lie a material re
duction in ihe price after the manufac
ture, of various types of vehicles becomes
t horoughly established.

BRUSSELS. June 29.â The
storm of verbosity was re
sumed in the Chamber of
Deputies to-day. The Socialists
hurled anathemas at M. J. Van
der Peereboom, who endeavored
to explain the action taken by
the police yesterday, and the So
cialists persistently interrupted
and insulted the Premier, re
proaching- him with being re
sponsible for conflicts between
the people and police. Later it
was announced that King Leo
pold had a long conference with
Van der Peereboom. Bergerem
and Bernaert, the latter being
summoned from The Hague. It
was reported that M. Van der
Peereboom would resign.
Although a vote censuring the
I Government was rejected by 87
to 31, the tumult in the chamber
I was so great that the President
suspended the sitting. The So
cialists then led a ..cheering
1 crowd, shouting "Vive la Repub
lique," to the park, where a con
flict with gendarmes occurred.
: Thence the mob proceeded to the
j by horses, such as are used in Xew York
i and Washington. The chief trouble with
them is that they are too small and men
do not' -have space, enough to properly
â  handle and assort the mail as it is collect
ed. This is especially true when collec-
tions are made in districts where mall

BODY FOUND ON
A RAFT OF LOGS
1 Mystery Surrounds the Death of
Mary Schweitzer, a Pretty
Washington Girl.
SEATTLE, June 29.â The news of a
1 mysterious tragedy was received this even
r ing from the lumber town of Ilofluiam, on
I Grays Harbor. The body of Mary
Schweitzer, a prepossessing' girl of IS
years, was found to-day in a raft of logs
I being' towed down the river. All kinds of
j rumors are rife as to the cause} of death,
t the prevailing opinion being that it was
! ihe result of a love affair. Sensational
i developments are expected.
The young girl has been missing for ten
days. On Sunday evening. June; IK, she
turned home about 9 o'clock "with a
: gentleman escort. She retired as usual,
! but arose and left home during the night.
| A young man claiming to know the cir
cumstances told her parents that .she had
gone to Seattle with money furnished by
others. Her people believed this and were
greatly, shocked when .told that, her
I body had been found.' .
Her gentleman friend; whose name is
! closely guarded, claims to be Ignorant of
any of the facts. Those who have hinted
that they possess Information' will prob
ably be held for examination. 'Several
who have seen the remains claim to have
; found blood on the arm and the appear
ance of the neck and. face gives the im
; pression of choking and foul play. â 
Mary Schweitzer's home was a pleas
; ant one on the banks of- t.he Hoquiam
River. just out of town. .' Her ' parents
came here from Chicago in 1897, and know
of no reason why she should take her
life. She had- a slight impediment in. her
speech, which, it is claimed, once caused
; her to remark that one day she would
jump in the river and drown herself.

When the Chamber reassem
bled to-night, M. Destre, Social
ist, called attention to the riots
which had occurred since the ad
journment, in which he was
struck by a gendarme's sword,
and demanded the man's pun
ishment. Thereupon the Cham
ber at once returned to a state of
tumult. The Socialists, sur
rounding M. Van der Peereboom
with clenched fists, denounced
him. As the tumult' increased
the Chamber rose.
In the meantime the streets
were tilled by a shouting mob,
which eventually gathered in
front of the War Ministry, where
gendarmes with swords attempt
ed to disperse the rioters.
At the conclusion of a great
meeting in the Town Hall this
evening, thousands attempted to
cross the Grande Place, in which
the Town Hall stands. The
gendarmes charged with drawn
swords and the crowd retaliated

GREATER RADIUS AND SPEED.
Irving M. Scott Speaks of Future
â  Warship Construction.
' NEW-YORK, June 29.â1n speaking of
probable changes in the future construc
tion of battleships and cruisers to be in
fluenced by-.experiences and lessons of the
late war Irving M. Scott said to-day:
â¢ "The two great changes which will bo
made in the construction of war vessels
in tile future will be those which will give
greater radius of action and which will
make vessel* swifter. Improvements in
power and steel will enable a decided re
auction to be mail.- in the size of spins,
and therefore, in the amount of ammuni
tion to be carried. This will reduce the
weight of the boat and enable greater
radius of action with the same displace
ment." :., -.:>â ;;;.

DECLARED TO BE
INCOMPETENT, BUT
BOLD AS SHYLOCK
Charges Against McNaughton
While fie Was Supertntend=
ent at Council Bluffs.
I 'MA HA. Juno 29. -The* records of the
School Board of Council Bluffs, [owa,
show that at the September, 1890, meet
ing-Mr. Hunter moved thai James Mc-
Naughton, Superintendent of Public
Scho B, be dismissed. The reason ac-
Blgned for this action was a petition
filed with the board, dated September
15, 1890, preferring charges against Mc-
Naughton. The motion was lost.
On October ltf. 1890, James M< Naugh
t"ii handed t<> the Board of Education
his written resignation, and it was
forthwith accepted.
Following is a copy of the charges
against M-cNaughton:
COUNCIL BLUFFS, la.. Sept. 15, I*9o.
To the Honorable th< Board of Direct
ors of the Independent School District of
Council Bluffs, la.â Gentlemen : Your pe
titioners would most respectfully r^prp
-,â â¢â  to your honorable body that they
are citizens, residents and taxpayers of
the city of Council Bluffs, la. That they
are Interested In the good management
and government of the public schools of
this cits .
Your petitioners further represent and
aver that James McNaughton. the perpon
who la now claiming to be Superintendent
â  it' ~ ; i i â  i Schools, is not a tit. proper or cap
able person to discharge the duties of said
office, ;t n<] that he has be.ni guilty in the
two years last past of such practices and
misdemeanors as that he should be at
dismissed and removed therefrom.
four petitioners for more- particularity
ami Bpeciflcness In the premises prefer the
following charges against the said James
McNaughton, to wit :
Firstâ Your petitioners aver that said
James McNaughton is incompetent for
that he Is deficient In scholarship, us 11
--ited l>\ false syntax and Incorrect or
thography In his compositions; that the
pedagogical method? pursued by him are
antiquated, as illustrated by the work de
manded In the study of the English lan
t:c;iu'.-. using as a textbooic last revised
in 1867; that he is Injudicious, as illusirat
..i for example by his requiring pupils
. from 10 to 12 years old, who have only
been at school" five years, to learn such
geometrical propositions as:
â 'The sum of thr.-e angles of a triangle
!.- equal to two right angles."
T,ot A B C be a triangle. We are to
prove that angle B plus angle B C A plus
angle a equals two right angles. Draw
c E parallel to A H and prolong A C.
The sum of all the angles about a
point on the same side of a straight line
equals two right angles. Now let angle A
equal angle E C F and angle 1? equal
angl< i< G E. Substitute for angles E C
l" and B <" B their equal angles A and B.
Then angle A plus angle B plus angle B
C a equals two right angles.
Second- Your petitioners aver that
I James McNaughton is unfit for the office
â if Superintendent, for that, he is im
moral; that he is insolent, ungentlemanly
and overbearing In his behavior to his
associates and subordinates; i.iat he as
ioclat< B with notorious characters and in
duces them to frequent the public school
buildings during school hours; that he re
sorts to tricks and practices deceit to
, accomplish bis purposes, and that, act
uated by sinister motives, he has in the
seven years he hns been in the office
managed directly and indirectly to secure
the removal of four worthy, competent
and deserving principals of the High
i School, namely. Miss Webster. Professors
! Ballinger, Prouty and Stevens.
Thirdâ Your petitioners further aver
; ihat the said James McNaughton has
been guilty of dereliction in the discharge
of his duties, for that he has been spend
ing a part of his time in the prosecution
of tits private business during school
hours: that he h;is failed to attend and
inspect the school rooms and the teach
.rs work as often :is the interests of
the school requited; mat he has failed
and refused to niakÂ» helpful suggestions
to the teachers or to aid them in the
prosecution of their work; that he has
failed to respond to reasonable and proper
requests of teachers made to him con
cerning school work: that he has com
peii.d substitutes to attend to work
which be Bhould have performed himself
as Superintendent; thai ne in ignorant of
the location of grades in the scnool build
! ings: that he failed to confer at an im
portant period with the teachers'' com
mittee with reference to school work for
;i period of two months.
Fourthâ Your petitioners further aver
that said James McNaughton Is a violator
of the laws of the State of lowa and has
been for two years last past engaged In
nefarious and Iniquitous practices. In that
he has bfMv co-operating with one Ovide
V*ien in exacting and receiving .extortion
ate and usurious sums of money from the
poorand distressed for loans madeon short

That he has exacted and received scores

jewelry, rag carpets, mules, horses,
calves, hogs, fu< 1. bedding, sewing- ma
chines, household furniture, barbers 1 ma
terial, chromos, trunks and second-hand
furniture dealers' stock-in-trade. That to
conceal his identity and connection with
these disreputable practices he has had in
ir.'>st instances the papers made out in
the name of his mother-in-law. .Mrs. M.
A. Wilson, sometimes in the name of.jani
tors ol the public schools and once only
in his own name. The amount he and his
;;ss.iciat"'s received for the use of their
â  monej varied from 3 to 11 per cent a
month. This may be Illustrated by the
tact 1 1 1 ; 1 1 he ainl his associates have re
ci Ived as high as $77 for the use of $100
for a litt!.- over nine months, and the

THE SLOT MACHINES
Sacramento Trustees Decide They Are
Banking Games and Cannot
Be Operated.
SACRAMENTO, June Some weeks
ago an order was issued by Chief of
Police Dwyer for the closing o*f the ni.kel
in-the-Blot gambling machines, with
which the town was so generously en
dowed. Immediately a howl, long and
loud went up from the owners of the
machines. The salesmen called the at
tention of the police to the prevalence of
keno,. and wanted to know why the "law
was not similarly enforced against' that
prohibited game. The police made a
spectacular demonstration in the direction
of stopping keno, but nothing came of it '
and keno thrives as of old. '
"hc-n the salesmen trot up a petition
asking that a license of $2 50 per month be
impose,] v,. l "? on each ' gambling slot ma
chine, which arrangement would net the
city an income of several hundred dollars
a month. It was pointed out that the
prosecutions in Los Angeles against the
machine owners were not had under the
State law but under a municipal ordi
nance and. that there was nothing In the
State law which would prevent the games
from being licensed, provided the local or
dinances against them were repealed
â¢ The Board of Trustees received the 'sug
gestion without much enthusiasm but it
was decided to refer the subject' to the
corporation counsel for an opinion The
corporation counsel has returned his
opinion, holding that the nlckel-in-the-slot
machines are In reality banking games
! and are prohibited by section 330 of the
; penal code, and their operation Is clearly
a misdemeanor under the statute with
out respect to local legislation. The cor
poration counsel adds that if the Cltv
Trustees license the machines they ma'v
be prosecuted for felony under section 337
of the same code.
Here is where the matter now stands
The machines are silent, and nickels are
: so plentiful that citizens are looking to
I product of the steam beer industry as a
; means to relieve themselves of the fas':
; accumulating surplus.

QUAY'S CHANCES
OF BEING SEATED
IN THE SENATE
From a Canvass Made by The
Call and Herald They Seem
to Be Evenly Divided.
NEW YORK, June 29.â Senator
Quay's chances of acceptance or
rejection by the Senate when he |
presents his credentials, signed by
Governor Stone of Pennsylvania,
are at presently evenly divided. A
careful canvass made by the Herald and |
the San Francisco Call of the members i
of the next Senate shows that it is prac
tically a toss-up whether the political '
ruler of Pennsylvania shall terminate his
service in the upper branch of the na- j
tional Legislature with a record of twelve
years, or whether this shall be allowed to !
run on to eighteen.
Many Senators, owing to their long as
sociation and personal relations with Sen
ator Quay, ,-is. well as many of the new
men, absolutely decline to give an Indi
cation of how they will vote. A consid
erable number of others are in Europe
or away from" their homes and beyond |
reach. '
Of thoff who an- set down as for or
against the Beating of Quay not all have
committed themselves, but their standing
in some instances has been inferred from
the'.r previous action or known opinions.
The case in a nutshell presents this al- ;
ternative: Will the traditions and preced
ents of the Senate prevail against Quay,
or will his political and personal connec
tions overcome them and let him in?
Following Is the result of The Call-
Herald's poll of the Senate:
There are vacancies in Delaware, Cali
fornia and Utah, which may be ill led by
appointement. Senator Quay must there
fore receive forty-nine votes to be seated.
Henry W. Corbett of Oregon, whose
I case is the latest precedent, was rejected
by the Senate by a vote nf 50 against him
! to U for him. twenty Senators failing to
vote. He was appointed by the Governor
after the Legislature had met and ad
journed without electing a Senator. This
is what the Pennsylvania Legislature did.
Senator Burrows of Michigan, a rawn
! ber of the Senate Committee on Privileges
i and Elections, said:
"Since the argument in the Corbttt
i case, wherein I took positive grounds
i against his right to the seat, I have seen

The Contest Is Close and Ex
citing to the Very Last
Ballot.
Miss Kate Bentley.
WOODLAND, June 29.â After a
spirited contest, which closed at
10 o'clock to-night and in which
there were a dozen or more can
didates. Miss Kate Bentley was
selected as Goddess of Liberty to
preside at the Fourth of July celebra
tion to be held In this city. The finish of
the contest was close and exciting. Miss
Bentley won her honors fairly over a Hell
of young ladies -acted lor their beauty
ar><l popularity; She will make an Ideal
goddess. â  ...
I nothing to change my mind, and I flo notÃ
believe the appointee of the chief execu-i|
tive of any oj the States where Legiala- I
â  turea have failed to elect Senators. is en- I
titled to be seated." I
"You may state In positive term;-, if I
you please," said Senator Jones of Ne- I
vada. "that I will vote to seat Mr. Quay, I
fur it is my belief that the several States I
I of the Union are entitled to equal repre
sentation in the upper. branch of Con
gress, as provided in the constitution,
and the fact that the State Legislature
! 'ailed to perform its duty should not de
i prive such State of its constitutional pre
rogative."
"On general principles I am opposed to
the seating- of Senators who obtain ..heir
appointments through the favor of the
Governor." said Senator Heitfeld of
Idaho. "There are four cases of that
character now pending, and I do not see
I how we can afford to make an exception
I in favor of Senator Quay. .It is. not a
; partisan question, nor can we afford to
i be governed by personal considerations."
Senator Penrose of Pennsylvania pre
dicted that Senator -Quay would ho seated
and added: "So far as Senator Quay is,
; concerned. I believe he is quite Indifferent
as to what action the Senate may take
upon the question of seating him."
Senator Pritehard of North Carolina
said: "I voted for the Beating of Senator
Corbett of Oregon, who was appointed
by the Governor, believing as I did that
he had the power to till any vacancy that
might exist at a time when the Legislat
, ure was not in session. I am still of the
opinion that such is the proper construc
tion of the section of the constitution
which relates to such cases."
"I have heretofore voted against the.
', seating of Senators appointed by a Gov
ernor after the Legislature of a State has
failed to elect," said Senator Cullorn of
Illinois. "I believe the constitution sus
tains me In that position. In the case of
: Senator Quay there may be circumstances
j which may justify us In going behind the
precedents set by the Senate. There are
four contests of the same character to be
decided, and I . consider the subject of
sufficient importance to warrant the full
est Investigation before a decision is ren
dered."
I Senator McMillan of Michigan, who
[ voted against Seating both Mr. Mantle
and Mr. Corbett, said: "I have expressed
the opinion, based on my judgment of the
probable action of the Senate, that Mr
Quay will be seated. 1 am not prepared;

when the question comes up. I do not
know how far the Quay case may differ
from the Mantle and CorbPtt cases.'"
Senator Slump of Idaho, speaking of the
charges of conspiracy against Senator
Quay, said: "That was entirely a local
matter. A fight was precipitated on Quay
for the purpose of downing him in the
, interest of John Wanamaker. Political
enemies might start a fight against any
man under similar circumstances for the
I purpose of building themselves up at his 1
'. expense. Personally 1 do not believe there i
was any criminal intent in anything Quay
, has done."
! Senator Rawlins of Utah intimated that
i he had not changed his opinions since he
voted against seating Corbett of Oregon
who was appointed under circumstances
! similar to those of the Quay case cIULe!J
"It may be a party question and Â»-ive
rise to other important considerations"
said Senator Taliaferro of Florida
< Doubt a caucus will settle the ques

KEETON CANNOT BE
TAKEN FROM MEXICO
Extradition Denied on the Ground
That He Is Only Charged as
an Accomplice.
AUSTIN, June 29,-The Mexican- Gov
ernment has declined to grant the extra
dition of John Keeton. the fugitive Amer
ican under arrest and in jail in Juarez.
Mexico, changed with complicity in the
robbery of a Texas and Pacific passenger
train, and the murder of the fireman, in
Ooleman County, Texas, over a year ago.
The extradition is sought on the indict
ment of Keeton. which alleges that
he was an acomplice in the crime:
The Mexican Government holds that the
new extradition treaty between the
United States and Mexico contains no
provision for the extradition of a fugi
tive charged with being an accomplice in
a crime. Keeton is under indictment in
Sutton and Valverde counties for sheep
stealing, and It is probable that applica
tion for his extradition will be made on
that charge.

opinion was rendered at a r
the State Board of Eftualizai
morning. It will be foll<ps\>,i :-;,
a written opinion, in which the
ney General will fully set forth hi: n
tention.
The board, in line with tin- Atti
General's opinion, has instructed S<
retary C. M. Coglan to write t<> \\v \
frigerator car companies and r<
them to file a statement under oa
similar to that furnished by the ;
road companies. Should the refriger
tor lines fail to respond, the board
require all tho railroad companies !
report the whereabouts of the ref]
ator cars upon their lines on March I
last. This action is taken under au
thority of Bection 3'J64 of the Political
Code, which requires all the rail'
to furnish the number of each kin<! of
all rolling stock used l>y such corpora
tion, person or association in operating
tht> â¢â mire railway, including the i>'i
within the State; and also the number.
kind ami value of rolling stock used in
the State, but owned by the party mak
ing the returns.
Inasmuch as the board will not meet
until July 17 for the purpose of as
sessing railroads, it will have ample
time in which to secure the informa
tion necessary to force the refrigerator
lines to pay taxes this year. Attorney
General Ford goes even further, and
holds that it is the duty of the State
Board of Equalization to assess not
only the refrigerator cars, but also oil
cars, Including those used for local
traffic and those used by the Standard
Oil Company; brewers' cars, stocti cai
and all cars found in the State â ><â .
March 1 and owned by Eastern roads.
This property has heretofore escaped
taxation and it is certain that, if the
bcirird is successful in enforcing its as
sessments, a vast additional income to
the State will be derived. Some mem
bers are of the belief that the car lines
designated may be compelled to pay
taxes this year, while others express
doubt, saying that the car companies
will probably use every effort to brin-;
about delay and thus thwart the tax
collectors.
PLANS TO REACH THE
ELUSIVE NORTH POLE
A. C. Jackson Thinks He Can Drift
Within 200 Miles of It and
Then Finish the Journey
On Land.
SKATTJJK, June 29.â At a meeting to
night of the Alaska Geographical So^
ciety its president, A. C. Jackson, pre
sented the latest .. and most novel
scheme for reaching the north pole.
Mr. Jackson announced that he pro
posed a* Priding the Congress of Geo
graphical Societies to be held in the
German metropolis next fall. Also that
he had written the president that he
would present a new scheme for north
polar 'exploration. He explained:
"Starting from the north coast of
ska. in the vicinity of Point Barrow
or elsewhere, with three ships provided
with supplies to last five or more years,
I shall propose to go as far north as
the ice will permit and then make fast
to the ice and drift as Nansen did, only
much farther, and when the pole is ap
proached disembark and go over the ice
by means of reindeer transportation.
"Another feature I snail propose will
be to establish telephonic communica
tion between the vesseis and the par
ties traveling overland. If Nansen had
taken 200 miles of copper wire with
him or had had any means to guide
him back t<> the Pram he would have
seemingly had no difficulty in reaching
the pole and would have saved himself
the fearful experiences of trayi
back to Franz Josef Land. After leav
ing the vessels stations might be estab
lish, 'd on the Ice and provisions cached
so that the return from the pole coul :
be nytde in comfort."

Special Dispatch to The Call.
PORTLAND, Juno 29.â Charles B.
Treacott, manager of the Trescott
Packing; Company; was more than sur
prised to-day when he heard of the
story of his wife's appearance on the :
Alcazar stage. The Call's publication '
was sent out by the Associated Press, j
Mr. Trescott was at his packing-house !
at Goble, forty miles from Portland.
When called up by The Call correspon
dent over the telephone Mr. Trescott
said he would he inclined to discredit '
the news if it had been published from i
a less reliable source.
He had no intimation from his wife
or from any one else that she had in
tended to enter a professional career.
While she cared a little for amateur
theatricals, ! just as other ladies do, she
had no fancy for the stage.
"My wife; has been troubled with
weakness of the lungs." said Mr. Tres- !
cott, "and had gone to California for
her health. I I received a letter from her
dated last Sunday, written in a cheer
ful tone, telling me she had been to
church. It is barely possible that her
lung trouble affected her mind a little
and that she took a sudden notion to â 
go on the stage. However, the news is
such a surprise that I hardly know
what to say."
Mr. and Mrs. Treseott were married
about six years ago, she having ob
tained a divorce from Frank Bates,
foreman of the painting department in
the Southern Pacific carshops. She
had a son by her first husband, who is
now about 10 years of age, and lives
with his father.

KOTZEBUE GOLD
NEVER EXISTED
Tale Started by Trans
portation Companies.
HUNDREDS WERE DECEIVED
NOT S5 WORTH OF GOLD FOUND
IN THE DISTRICT.
Prospectors Who Flocked Thither
Weary of Pursuing Chimeras
and Anxious Only to Gtet
Back Home.
Special Dispatch to The <\il!.
SEATTLE. June 29 âThe latest ad
vices from Kotzebup, Alaska, are given
in a letter from Albeit C. Thees, form
erly of this place, who writes under
the date of January 9 that not a bit of
gold has been found where It 1 win
tered on the Ku-Buck River, and the
question with the miners there is how
to pet away. There "were in camp
twenty-three whites and twenty-eight
natives opposite the mouth of the Hunt
River. Mot a cent of gold, says Thees,
has been taken out of the whole coun
try, and they consider they are entirely
3tit of the mineral belt. one man was
drowned, having broken through the
ice while hauling mail into the country
from the roast. A good deal of 'salt
ing" had been done, which has caus< 1
more or less excitement.
Thees says the miners expect to set
out on the revenue cutter Hem-. There
are, he thinks. TOO people in the Kotze
bue, fifty on Wick River and )2~> <>n tlv-
Notoark.
The health of the whites has been
good, but numbers of the natives have
died.
Dr. .1. S. Si .me, a well-known physi
cian, when went to Kotzebue Sound
with a party of prospectors in I*9\ has
written the following letter to the As
sociated Press:
KOWAK RIVKR. Alaska, mouth of
Maun.' i. ink River, .Inn. \ 1899. â A letter
was published on March 31. 1898, written
by niie John Ross to W. C. Ralston in
reference to the fabulously rich mines on
this river he having taken out $.",."., i'<*t in
fifteen or twenty days. Captain Cogan
also reported that in his trips to the Arc
tic after bone and blubber he ha<i an
chored in Kotzebue Sound and had found
gold on his anchor and propeller blades.
This letter was seized by some of the
transportation companies, printed in cir
cular form arid sent broadcast over the
United Stales. Vessels were put in readi
ness and billed ;., leave <â !! a certain date
for "the richest gold fields in Alaska"
"Already Discovered" "No Mountain
Climbing" â "One Day's Boating or Two
Days' Towing From Kotzebue Sound."
As a result some 1500 ixi*>n paid their $200
passage fee, bought two years' supply of
clothing, provisions, etc., and came to
Alaska, only to find on their arrival that
every word containeu In the circular was
falseâ a lie made out of whole cloth.
Even after leaving San Francisco the
passengers on most vessels had to help
out the crews in making sail and the food
we had to eat was execrable.
There has been no gold found on Kotze
bue Sound, on either the Kowak, Notoark
er Selawik rivers, which flow into Hotham
Inlet, a part of the sound, or any of their
tributaries in anything like paying quan
tities to date. Some infinitesimal colors
have been found, which require a power
ful glass to see; but if every single color
found had been carefully saved all to
gether would not have weighed one single
dollar.
Th>- tirst river prospected was the Squir
rel, eighty miles above the mouth of the
Kowak â prospected from head to mouth.
Then the Reed, Salmon. I.abret and Hunt
all further up the Kowak. and nothing
but very fine colors found. Next came the
Ambler, nearly as large as the Kowak.
This was thoroughly prospected ami par
ties crossed over to the headwaters of i
the Notoark. Nothing was found there
but the same fine colors. Other parties
weni up the Shung-Nack. Cosmos, Kogo
luktuk, Pick-kne-Che-ArX. Man-ne-luok
and Par rivers with like results. This |
winter all the tributaries of these stn ams
are being prospected and more than one
thousand holes are being sunk to bedrock, j
which in many places is very deep and
difficult to reach. Frequently the prospect
hole is thirty-five feet deep with no bed
rock and no colors.
After removing the surface moss and
six or seven feet of muck or gravel you
often strike a warm spring of water that j
immediately fills up the hole and runs
over. After this feezes you chop out the :
ice, fire again to thaw the underlying
ground, and after digging a few ivi-r an
other spring breaks forth with like results
and treatment. Finally. bedrock is !
reached and in the majority of instances
not ;i single color is found.
About the ist of November a report !
came from the Allashook. a tributary of
the Koyoukuk, saying that gold in large
quantities had been found there. Imme
diately all was excitement and more than
one hundred of our party loaded up their
sleds and started for the new "El Dora
do." After sixteen days of hard work,
cutting trails and pulling sleds with a
load of 250 pounds, with the thermometer
from 4"i to tiO degrees below zero, these
men arrived at Beaver City, a city of
seven cabins, on the Allashook. to find
all these reports false. They had bt en
started by two men. one a merchant who
had supplies to sell, and the other the
recorder of claims, who hoped to cause a
rush to record claims and to sell supplies, i
All these men have returned and state
that the prospects there are even worse;
than here. Reports from the Koachatnu,
another tributary of the Koyoukuk, have
taken over Zanes Pass several men who ,
are expected back next week. Of the 1500 i
men who came here probably one-half :
returned by the vessels that brought
them. The remainder are here and at
work, all discouraged and only waiting
for the ice to leave SO that they can go
back to Kotzebue Sound and await the. i
coming of some ship to take them back
to civl.zation. Will that ship come?
Do not let these transportation compa
nies hoodwink the people again on mere j
conjecture. If there is anything found
here the -world will know it. This is c
cold, inhospitable country that produces
nothing to save life. There is no game;
nothing raised in the soil. Fish are abun
dant, hut without good, warm clothing
and plenty of provisions no one could live
here. There has not been seen thi.s win- j
ter or since July last a single bear, deer,
moose, elk or even a rabbit. During th~> !
summer a few wild geese were killed, and
tills winter a few grouse. There is practi
, tally nothing here in the shape of animal ,
' lifebut the "Arctic mouse." the most d< -
Btructive animal of its size with which F j
urn acquainted, and as I write this I hear
him cutting into our sacks of provisions.
There are very few birds. 1 can only re
call two that I have seen this winter.
They may migrate to a warmer climate.
Although the thermometer registers from
48 to tit') below zero, I do not feel the cold !
; very much. If one is .out for any length i
of time one must rub one's nose, cheeks
and ears or they will freeze. Many have j
been slightly frostbitten.

stood were foUnd three flattened bullet*.
Two of them fitted the pistols used by
Bache and Anderson. The Chinamen un
doubtedly wore coats of mail, and when
struck were simply knocked, down. This
accounts for the flattened bullets and th-Â»
officers seeing the men fall. â 
After Bache had been attended to th<Â»

ROWDYISM RULES
THE CARNIVAL
Scenes of Rioting at
Milwaukee.
SiÂ»- lal EMs] itch 'to T\ â 
MILWAUKEE. June 29.â This city was
the scene to-nlj rioting and of
rowdyism of siii ! a' ie< uliarly atrocious :
nature that every Mitwaukeean will ever
aft.r blush for shame when he hears nr
if it. â -'.'
midnight forty men had been grath- 1
ered In by the police on a chart;.- of : as
eaulting womei Bedlam reiu:is. and the
authorities.seem powerless to restore or
der. This was municipal day In the w.-.-k
of cirnfvai. â¢
All busii â  suspended that Mil
waukeeans might be Â£r<?e to witness the
masque pageant during tJI * - afterno.on,
and it is estlmai strangers
came t'> swell the throng and join ii
fun.
During the progress of the parade the |
participants were pelted with confections â 
wrapped In brightly tinted papers and .
with artificial flowers, â  li was a pleasing |
feature of the masque and was thor
oughly enjoyed by the pelters and peltees. i
The throwing of : confetti was innocent'
enough and none objected to it, but â  by
nightfall confetti was .too tame for. the
average hoodlums, arid, they substituted
dirt and dust from ; the street, bran,
flour, paint and water.
Women's costly gowns . were ruined,
men's hats smashed, and there was per
, fee; bedlam on the principal streets, the
police seemingly being unable to stop the
â  rowdyism.
Water was thrown In bucketfuls from
the roofs of tall buildings on Grand aye- j
line ana Wisconsin street, and many car- i
'nival costumes were ruined.
. A battle of confetti, engaged In by a
.number of men in front of the First Xa- â¢
â¢tional Bank building, resulted in an as- j
/sault on Alderman Greene. After he had ]
(been covered with the dirt of the street
â tsome, one on top of the building threw :i
i-tubful of water upon his head, and koiiv
-one else covered him with several pounds
t Â»of flour. The city father was a mass of
Mough, bareheaded, and a most forlorn
.looking object.
This was but one of the hundreds of
jcanes. Even Mayor 1; â â â¢'- did not escape
In passing the Hotel Pflster he was spied i
, by a hundred young men, who proceeded '
'to cover him with confetti This was
âºvery amusing to the Chief Executive of
'The city, and he passed on with his high
hat unharmed until he entered the por
tals of the hotel, where the man who al
; ways overdoes the thing stood with a.
i'handful of dirt. This was thrown into j
-Die Mayor's face, which turned his good
nature smile to one of <!â¢â > concern. He
instructed the Police Department to.
double the efforts to stop the rowdyism,
â and several arrests were made.
As night wore on the hoodlums became |
seemingly frenzied. Bricks, stones and |
I paving blocks were substituted ' for dirt
: and dust pepper for lioifr.and ink and
axle grease for water. Twenty women
â¢were brought into the emergency hospi
tals blinded with pepper and other sub- i
stances thrown in their faces. Women
seemed the special objects of the mis
guided attentions of the crazed rioters
They were hugged, kissed and torn :
screaming from friends and dragged Into
alleys, their clothing torn and their hats
like those of the men In the crowds'
. smashed or torn off and thrown into tlio
street: gowns daubed with axle grease or
doused with Ink or other filthy discolor
ing fluids shot at them from horse

positively that he proposed making an ex- I

WILL REDUCE THE COST
OF LIQUEFIED AIR
NEW FORK, June 29.â For the first
time- in this country a plant has been
established and practically operated Cor
the production of liquefied air or liquid^
air, as it is called commercially. This j
plant has been devised and constructed,
under th>- direction of Oscar P. Oster-|
gren and Moriz Burger, arid is located
at 531 W'^st Thirty-third street. It Is I
capable, with 100 horsepower developed
by steam, of manufacturing about 1500
gallons of liquefied air in twenty-four
hours, or about one gallon a minute.
Its practical success is demonstrated
by two facts. It ran produce liquefied
air. comparing equal expenditure of
power, three times as rapidly as the
best apparatus deyised by Professoi
Linde of Munich and at about one
third the cost 'The cist of liquefying
air by the Ostergren process is about
one-third that of the process used by
Charles E. Triplet* of this city. Oster

further the cost of manufacturing lique
fied air from G to 8 cents per gallon, as
at present, to about 2 cents.

LORD ROBERTS'
ARAB CHARGER
VONOLEL. General Lord Roberts' Arab charter, whose death at the age of 29
was published in Wednesday's Call, was a remarkable animal. In a sense
Vonolel was almost n* prreat a warrior as Lord Roberts himself, for the
horse bad participated In the chief victories of bis gallant master. He bore
the general In the famous march from Cabul to Candahar, In the Afghan
campaign, and so nobly did he acquit himself that he received, by special per
mission of Queen Victoria, the Afghan medal with four clasps and the Cabul-Can
dahar star. These decorations he wore on his breastplate on prand occasions, and
it is safe to say that at these times if any one attracted more attention than
General Roberts it was bis beautiful Arab charter.
WILL NOT SIT
NEAR NEGROES
Race War in Stockton
Christian Church.
Spe.-lal Dispatch to The rail.
STOCKTON, June. 29.â The Question
as t<> whether or ii"t colored people
shall be allowed t<> Choose their own
pews is creating considerable fe< linp in
the First Christian Church of this city.
But for the tact and diplomacy of Rev.
Dr. Thomas Boyer, the pastor, the dis
sension would have before this reached
so acute a state as to interfere with
th<* prosperity <>f. the church.
The church membership includes a
number "f Southern people, who have
not accepted reconstructed conditions
so far as to admit of the equality of the
races. Among these is W. D. Miller, a
leader in the church affairs, and one of
the financial pillars. When the congre
gation recently moved Into its hand
some new church edifice on Lindsay
and California streets. Brother Miller
concluded that it would be well to start
out right on the race question* by as
signing to the colored members and at
tendants of the church certain seats
with notice that they would be ex
pected to occupy these and no others.
Dr. Boyer heard of the move and.
knowing the trouble it would cause be
tween the two political factions in the
church, he diplomatically told Mr. Mil
ler that he would Berve the notice, be
lieving that he could do SO in a man
ner less calculated to offend the colored
people.
Now, Rev. T>r. Boyer being a man of
advanced political and social ideas, is
not- burdened with any of the Southern
prejudice against the negro so long as
the negro conducts himself as a good
citizen should. Among the members of
the church are Mrs. Hall and daughter,
colored women. Dr. Boyer went to
them and asked if they would have
any objection to picking out a pew and
considering it as their own. He was
careful to explain that he had no sym
pathy with the idea, but for the sake of
peace he hoped the colored sister would
act favorably upon the suggestion. The
peacemaking pastor labored in vain, for
Mrs. Hall is overly zealous and sensi
tive of her "rights," and she unwound
her tongue and dilated upon the usual
arguments about the black and white
cattle feeding at the same manger.- Dr.
Boyer assured her it w:ls no move to
drive the colored people out of the
church, and that if the people of South
ern ideas did that he would resign the
pastorate and go also. This Dr. Boyer
will do. He Is one of the ablest pulpit
orators on the coast and possesses?un
usual business ability, as is evident
from the fine church building recently
erected. The pastor's statement has
caused a lull in the discord, as the con
gregation thinks very much of him. In
the meantime the colored people sit
where they wish.
This may be temporary only, as thorp
are several more rabid opponents of the
equal privilege idea, who are deter
mined to force the .issue, even though
the colored people are driven out of the
church fellowship.

BONDHOLDERS SUE
THE RAILROADS
Foreclose Central Paci-
fie Mortgages.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, June 23.â Suit was
broughi In the Superior Court of this
county this afternoon by D. O. Mills
and Ogden Mills', trustees for holders
of bonds upon the railroad properties
of thÂ» Central Railroad Company, as
plaintiffs, vs. the Central Pacific Rail
road Company! the United States of
America, the Metropolitan Trust Com
pany of New York, and the Southern
Pacific, as defendants.
The attorneys of record for the plain
tiffs are Paterson, Brown & Slack of
San Francisco.
Judge Paterson, when asked to-day
for an explanation of the suit, said:
"This action was brought to foreclose
the liÂ» m of 'series A" of the first mort
gage bonds of the Central Pacific Kail
road Company, issued July 25. 1865, to
D. O. Mills and William K. Barron, as
trustees. The face value of all the
bonds secured by the mortgage is $6,
--378,000. The mortgage covers the
properties of the Central Pacific Rail
road Company from Sacramento to the
eastern boundary <>f California. The
bonds matured July 1. lSy.">, but on
April -7. IM'.", the trustees, with the
consent of the bondholders, extended
the time for jiayment until January 1,
1898. On August 5. 1597, a further "ex
tension of time was granted until the
Ist day of December, IS9S. The com
pany, having failed to make payment
within the time stipulated, on June 21,
1809. the holders of more than fifty
bonds requested the trustees to cony
ni' hi. foreclosure proceedings.
"As the bonds matured on July 1,
lS9r>. the statute of limit.'itions would
run against the bonds within four
years, thereafter, or on July 1, 1899. It
was necessary, therefore, in the pro
tection of their rights, as against sub
sequent lienholders, that the bondhold
ers should tile this suit to prevent the
running of the statute against their
claims, and the suit is brought for that
purpose <tlone, as I understand it. At
least, we are not instructed to do any
thing more tha*i to file a complaint.
"The action is necessarily brought in
one of the four counties through which
the road covered by the mortgage ex
tends, namely, Sacramento, Placer. Ne
vada a.:id Sierra. We do not expect a
judgment against the United States,
which cannot be sued. The Govern
ment, however, can b^ notified of a pro
ceeding against property in which it
claims an interest, and in that way
we think its equity of redemption may
be determined."
RESTRAINED FROM CUTTING
RIVAL COMPANY'S WIRES
Controversy Between the Inland
and British Columbia Lines
Now in Court.
SPOKANE, Wash.. June 29.â The In
land Telephone ami Telegraph Company
of San Francisco -was sued to-night for
$L':ir,.iiHu damages by the Spokane and Brit
ish Columbia Telephone Company and re
strained l>y order of court from cutting
the la,ttf*r company's wires.
The two companies have parallel lines
from here to British Columbia mining
towns, md each has been doing a iarge
business. The British Columbia, under an
agreement, has been for three years using
the Inland local exchange, having- none
of its own.
It claims that recently the Tnland Com
pany declared this agreement off and r<
fuged to receive messages here, and, fur
ther, that the Inland Company has de
stroyed all the plaintiff company's wires
in this city, cutting them twice between
each pole for a distance of over three
miles and tearing them from the poles.
It i-; alleged that the insulators and cross
aims were also violently removed and
destroyed. It is on thjs account that the
$2iT>.ooo damages are asked.
ThÂ»" British Columbia company also de
mands a permanent injunction to restrain
the Inland Company from in any way in
terfering with the plaintiff's property. A
temporary injunction was granted to
night by Judge Richardson of the Superior
Court. The application for the permanent

ALMIRA IS GUARDED BY ARMED
DEPUTIES.
Disease Broke Out in Farming
Towns and.Was Spread Around
by Transient La
borers.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SPOKANE. June 29.â Eastern Washing
ton is greatly excited over a widespn ad
smallpox scare. In a number of towns all
public gatherings have been prohibited.
Several towns, particularly Almira, Lin
coln County, are under strict quarantine.
Daily reports of new cases continue to
come in from new location?--, and in nearly
every case it is learned that scores have,
been subject to the contagion before th<'
serious character of the disease was dis
covered. This latter condition is largely
I due to the fact that the outbreak has oc
| currcd In small farming communities, and â¢
the disease is mild and frequently pro
nounced chicken-pox or some minor ail
ment. To-day a case was discovered at
Colfax. Whitman County. The patient j
had been wandering about town for days,
I spreading the contagion. He has been
| placed in the pesthouse and everybody is
I being vaccinated. The farmers', dairy
men and livestock convention which Was
to havi> been held in that city for three
I days beginning to-morrow h;is been In
definitely postponed on account of the
scare.
A new case whs reported in Ppokane
to-day, the ninth from among the em
ployes of a local brick yard. ,vJI the pa
tients here are doing well. About forty
have had the disease in this city, with no
deaths. There are several cases at Walla
"Walla, and the citizens are oppose.) to
holding the contemplated Fourth of July
celebration there. Almira is under strict
quarantine by order of the Lincoln Coun
ty authorities. Four armed Deputy Sher
iffs are on guard to prevent persons en
tering or leaving the town. Two months
ago the school teacher became sick. The
ailment was pronounced chicken-pox and
he continued teaching. Now it is learned
he had smallpox. Health Officer Potter
of Spokane, who was called there yester
day, saw seven well developed cases of
smallpox, and declares that hundreds of
persons have been exposed.
An epidemic of the disease is confidently
expected here. A Spokane deputy Sheriff
to-day arrested at Marshall, this' county.
a man badly broken out with smallpox.
Five men who slept in a box car with the
patient have gone to Fairfleld, where nev
er;.! hundred men are employed in the
erection of a beet-sugar factory and cul
tivation of the crop. In almost every
Instance the disease is carried from place
to place by transient laboring men.
Smallpox cases have been discovered
among the railroads camps on the con
struction up Clearwater Valley. Idaho.
and at both the Great Northern and
Northern Pacific tunnels in this State.

LONG TITLE AND
A LONG RECORD
Career of a Princess at
San Rafael.
MANY SORROWING CREDITORS
CLAIMED TO HAVE GIFTS FROM
THE CZAR OF RUSSIA.
She Had a Good Stock of Fairy Tales,
Which Gave Her a Standing
and Unlimited
Credit.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAX RAFAEL, Juno 29.â About two
months ago a woman arived in town
calling herself the Princes yon. Ben
theim. Her full name anrl title was
given ap the Princess Louise Charlotte
Moriana Johanna yon Bentheim, and
after the expiration <>f two months
several people -have learned to; their
Borrow, it is alleged, that the Princess
has a record as longr as her name.
Rev. Father Lagan is the latest person
to suffer at th^ hands of the so-called
adventuress, and he has proved such a
tartar that it is likely the titled lady
will soon seek a chanpe of climate.
When the Princess lirst reached here
she went to the Cypress Villa Hotel for
board and lodgings. There she related
a fairy tale to the proprietor, W. F.
Warburton, and so enlisted his sympa
thies that she managed to get accomr
modations valued at JSQ.for nothing.
Two weeks ago Princess Louise fold
Warburton that her husband and seven
children hud died at Piedmont four
years ago. At her residence there she
claimed to have a costly lamp and a
pair of vases, both of which were r< p
resontecl as gifts of the Czar of Russia.
These, she asserted, she intended to
present Warburton for his many acts of
kindness.
On the same day the hotel-keeper was
astonished t<> discover that the woman
had ordered a lamp and pair of vases
for him from a 'oral dealer, hut had
failed to pay for th'>m. The Princess
left the house alter this expose and
"did the town" to a brown turn so far
as lay in her power. Mrs. Ih-mans lost
a considerable 511 mby her operations.
A few days ago Father Lagan dis
covered that the Princess had taken
advantage of the fact that an enter
tainment is to be held at Larkspur for
the benefit "f the Catholic church <>n
July 3 and had issued circulars for an
entertainment at the same place on the
evening of July 1.
Across the bottom of these circulars
was a statement that the event billed
for July 1 was for the benefit of the
Catholic church. These delusive words
proved a snare to the thoughtless and
a source of revenue to Princess yon
Bentheim until Father Lagap heard of
her venture and last evening verbally
chastised her on the street as a titled
fraud and an Impostor. The woman
quickly walked away and had not a
word to say in reply.
A peculiar thins is that the woman is
really a remarkable musician and had
been secured to furnish music at
Father Lagan's entertainment. In dis
cussing the affair this evening- Mr.
Warburton said:
"Upon investigation I find that this
woman's career is not limited to San
Rafael. She has swindled people in
Sacramento, Pan L,ufs Dtotepo and Mo
desto. ShÂ« claims that she has a
second husband living in Knoxvill.-.
Term. I forced her to leave here, and
have since heard of numerous persons
imposed upon by her. She is a
dangerous woman and should be at
tended to by the authorities."

MISS M'GINLEY WAS
ILLEGALLY DISMISSED
She Wins Her Suit Against the San
Jose School Board and Gets
Back Salary.
SAX JOSE, June 29.â Miss Kittie Me-
Ginley, the kindergarten teacher who was
lismissed last November when the City
Board of Education closed a number of
kindergartens, was to-day given a verdict
in h.-r suit against the city to recover
$-'ju due as salary since her dismissal.
The opinion was rendered on motion of
City Attorney Beasly for nonsuit, which
was denied, and practically Bettles the
matter, as all the points at issue had been
raised. The board closed .-ight kind* r
rartens and dismissed seventeen teachers
last November because of financial re
trenchment. Two months later they re
opened four of the schools and employed
'â ight teachers. Miss McGiniey had been
employed in the Sarah B. Cooper Kinder
garten, and when that school was 're
opened Mrs. Ella Graham, wife of Trus
tee Graham, was employed there. Miss
McGiniey alleged that Graham had engi
â  . ered the matter so as to provide a place
for his wife. Miss McGiniey refused to
be ousted and reported at the school
every day. Suit was brought, alleging
t hat the board's action was illegal in
that a special meeting had been improp
erly called, and her position had not been
abolished, as the school was reopened.
Judge Kittredge decided that the call
tor h special meeting, at which the
â la were abolished, was not sufficiently
â¢ â¢ as to its object. Miss McGiniey
will Becure her old position by the de
cision and get her back salary.
[1 is said that other kindergartners who
lost their positions in the same manner
cannot recover them, as they failed to
make a demand for reinstatement or ap
pear to perform th< ir duties.
STOCKTON'S TANGLE OVER
FOURTH OF JULY PARADE
Some of the Exempt Firemen Will
Not March With Chinese, and
the Trouble Deepens.
ST< '< :KT< IN, June 29.â The Exempt Flre
men at "a meeting to-night called by B. P.
Kohlberg 1 , the president, voted to not
turn out in the Fourth of July procession
unless the committee withdrew the invi
tation to Chinese to participate. It was
a warm meeting, and the cry. "The Chi
must go," prevailed over what
seemed to be the reasonable arguments
advanced by the minority. The Fourth
of July Committee, while regretting the
agitation raised by Kohlberg, will not
withdraw the invitation to the local
Chinese, who did not come into the cele
bration till asked. The end Is not yet, as
a majority of the members of the com
pany was not present at to-night's meet
ing. They openly declare to a man that
they will parade on the Fourth and that
they will bring out the company, properly
in spit-- of Kohlberg, who, they declare,
is an agitator of the worn-out question
and is trying to embarrass Grand Marshal
Koch, a political rival. Some who accept
wild rumors afloat anticipate trouble on
the Fourth, either among the Exempts
themselves or by some violence- toward
the Chinese division in the procession.
The committee is much embarrassed over
the situation, but it is not thought any
other organizations will follow suit of the
firemen, nor does the public take kindly
to Kohlberg's statement that "any one
who parades with a ! Chinese is a China
man.

that the company is organizing a Pacific

"It is not true that we have entered into

ten years or any other period. We arcs

have made no contracts with any one in

Water Getting Very Scarce.
WOODLAND, June ii).â Attorneys for
the Moore ditch property are in Capay
Valley to-day making an Investigation.
The water supply is running very low
and such conditions at this time of the
year cannot be accounted for except upon
the theory that somebody not authorized
to do so is diverting water from Cache
Creek for Irrigation purposes. Under a
decision of the Supreme Court nobody Is
ellow'ed to divert water from the creek
above Moore's dam unless there Is suffi
cient remaining to fill the Moore ditch
bankfull.

JACK KANE IS
TOO MUCH FOR
BOXER INGHAM
Police Bring the Bout
to an End.
â *+â â
LET IT GO THREE ROUNDS
EXCITING SCRAPS AT THE SAN
FRANCISCO ATHLETIC CLUB.
Two Clean-Cut Decisions and Two
Draws Highly Pleased the
Crowd Which Thronged
the Structure. ,
"Jack" Kane volunteered to take the
place of an absent boxer at the exhibition
of the San Francisco Athletic Club last
night. His announced weight was 132
pounds, while that of W. Ingham was
given at Wi. He looked twenty pounds
heavier and was apparently able to
annihilate his opponent. This was be
fore the gong clanged sending them to
gether.
From the start Kane showed remark
able cleverness, coupled With great hit
ting power, and had Ingham in difficulty
at once. In the second round he ham
mered his man all over the ring, knock
ing him down repeatedly: Ingham was
foolishly game. He was up instantly, only
to gu down again. His left eye assumed
unusual proportions and a deep blue
color. The third round was a repeti
tion of the previous ones and it had not
gone far when the police ordered it
stopped.
"Jack" Dean and Ed Toy boxed eight
rounds, throughout which there was
hardly a slow interval. The decision
went to Toy on points. He forced the
fighting throughout, but found Dean will
ing. The youngsters collided in mid-rinif
repeatedly, the crash sounding like a
pair of battering rams. There was lively
gloving at times, when they stood up
and returned blow for blow without any
attempt at guarding.
James Crawford and George Dodson, a
brace of colored boxers, fought four fast
rounds to a draw. Crawford has a
straight left, with which he did consider
able execution. After a time Dodson
threw his arms about like a flail. Every
time his blows landed the sound was like
a resounding whack on a bass drum.
"Jack" McMahon received the decision
over "Kid" Johnson, the latter standing a
lot of punishment.
Henry I,ewis and Torn Monlhan boxed a
draw. The bout seemed likely to end at
any time, each man being in clanger of
going out several times.
Alex Gregguins was referee in all the
bouts.
PETER JACKSON'S BENEFIT.
Great Colored Boxer to Be the Stellar
Attraction at Woodward's
To-Night.
The sporting fraternity has shown a
great deal of interest in the benefit to be
tendered Peter Jackson at Woodward's
Pavilion to-night. The programme in
cludes the name of every boxer of promi
nence in this district, so, if anything.
those in attendance will get a surfeit or
the game of attack and defense.
The beneficiary will don the gloves with
Alec Greggain.s, the best-preserved of the
old guard of heavy-weight boxers. Joe
Kennedy, the new star, will box with big
Soldier Walker, while Gus Ruhlin. anoth
er of the heavy-weight division, Ail. Neill,
George Green and a host of other boxers
will be. ready to appear in friendly bouts.
To leaven the programme with a little
bard hitting two ten-round bouts have
been arranged. The first of these will be
between Emil Dahl, Olympic Club, and
Kid Vickers, San Francisco Athletic Club.
The second brace will be made up of Doc
Flynn. South End Club, and Pete Mc-
Gee, Manhattan Athletic Club.
Green and Goff Matched.
George Green and Charley Goff have
b?en matched to box twenty rounds be
fore the National Club late in July.
CAN MARRY WHEN SHE LIKES.
James Whittle Promises in Court
Not to Molest His Daughter.
James Whittle, the longshoreman
charged with threatening to kill his
daughter Catharine and her betrothed,
William H. Goodwin of 520 Howard street,
appeared before Judge Graham yesterday
morning. He was represented by Attor
ney Glover, and the girl conducted her
own case.
The girl testified to the threats made
by her father, and she was corroborated
by Mrs. Goodwin. Whittle took the stand
ahd said that, when he returned from Ma
nila about two weejis ago and went to live
at the Goodwin house his daughter never
came near him, but was always in the
company of young Goodwin. Ho denied
threatening to kill her or Goodwin, and
promised faithfully not to molest her
again. He wanted her to keep her brother
Edward, a boy 14 years of age, but she
had refused to have anything to do with
him. The boy was in court and added
fuel to the flames by saying that^hin sis
ter was the cause of his mother's death.
Then father and daughter got to wrang
ling in court, each accusing the other of
being cruel to the deceased parent. The
Judge interrupted the discussion n.nd
asked the daughter if she would live, with
her father, but she refused, as she said
she was afraid of him, and on Whittle
again promising not to molest her even
if she got married to Goodwin the Judge
dismissed the case.
THE MEDAL FUND.
Additional Subscriptions â A Design
for a Certificate Adopted.
The following: contributions to the Cali-.
fornla medal fund were received by Sec
retary P. B. Ryan yesterday: N. Clark &
Sons; Nolan Bros.' shoe store and Mount
Diablo Parlor, N. S. G. W., $10 each; G.
H. Young; Carlson, Currier & Co.; J. C.
Nolan & Co.; Williams Marine Company;
C. Haas & Sons; Bullock & Jones Co.; S3.

ville Company; Siebe Shoe Company, and
Court Bay View, A. O. F... $5 each; pro.
coeds of an entertainment gi%*en by Las
Positas Parlor of Livermore, $50 55. Pre
viously received, $5237 80, making a total
of $3380 35.
The general committee met last night
and referred the bids of three firms to
furnish dies and medals to the committee
on medals for further Investigation.
It decided to adopt the design for a cer
tificate presented by 11. R. Hopps. The
motif of the man's design is the greeting
of the Romans to their victorious armies
"a crown for a spear."
The figures on the design represent
"camp life." "marching to the front "
"the Oregon's last shot," "the battle of
Manila Bay," "the Olympia storming a
fort." "defending the ammunition,
wagon" and a "private guarding a wound
ed officer." In the center is the name of
the donators and space for the name of
the recipient, and the branch of the serv
ice in which he enlisted.
A Vicious Drunk.
While drunk last night a laborer named
Harmann Rippe attempted to stab Officer
Herring of the Chinatown squad at the
corner of Kearny and Clay streets. Rippo
had been aggravated by some boys,
whereupon he drew a knife, but was "in
terrupted by the officer. He turned upon
the latter and made a vicious lung-e but
the officer promptly knocked him down
with a club and disarmed him. After be
ing treated at the Harbor Hospital for a-i
abrasion on the side of his head he was
charged with drunkenness at the Califor
nia street station.

OLYMPICS WILL
KEEP THE RELAY
RACE TROPHY
So Ruled by Associ
ated Clubs.
A REMARKABLE MEETING
THE ACMES, BAY CITYS AND EN-
CINALS RETIRE.
The Protest of the First-Named Not
Allowed and Its Representa
tives Declare the Club
Will Withdraw.
At the meeting of the California Asso
| ciated Cycling Clubs held last night in
! the Parrott building the protest filed by
j the Acmes against the Olympic Club
| Wheelmen, charging that the latter ac
i cepted pacing in the last annual hundred
| mile relay race and was not, therefore,
i entitled to the cup, was not sustained.
The vote declaring that the protest was
null and void was 20 to 2. The Acme, Bay
j City and Encinal clubs did not vote, but
j retired just before the vote was taken.
The meeting, which lasted nearly four
hours, was one continual round of un
pleasant personalities that at times
threatened to develop into personal al
tercations. Chairman Nlppert was al
most powerless to preserve order.
\V. H. L. Hynes of the Acme Club, who
attempted the prosecution against the
Olympics, and C. A. Adams of the latter
club, who appeared in its defense, en
gaged in a number of tilts, without re
gard to either their language or insinu
: ations. The entire meeting was charac
! terized by the bitterest feeling and the
lack of courtesy upon the part of the
members of the various clubs who were
1 opposed to each other upon the question
;of the protest. The Acme and Encinal
j club members declared that their clubs
! would withdraw from the California As
: sociated Cycling Clubs.
As soon as the meeting was called to
I order the trouble began. E. F. Fahrbach.,
i president of the Bay City Club, was pres
| fnt as the proxy of F. H. Kerrigan, the
, club's regular delegate. T. L. Hill and
; Hynes endeavored to have his certificate
iof proxy thrown out upon technical
i grounds. .-.ln this they failed, and also In
j the case of the Reliance Club's, delegates.
I This matter alone consumed two hours.
Finally Hynes got down to the. work
of examining his witnesses. Harry M
Kenneday of Oakland, A. E. Miles of
Oakland and M. C. Rambo of San Fran
cisco testified to seeing Bozio of the
Olympic Club taking pace on the eighth
relay. Adams in his cross-examination
of these witnesses attempted to impeach
their testimony and to prove that the
other clubs were also taking pace.
After excessive bickering upon the part
of Hynes and Adams, E. 13. Jerome of the
Reliance Club moved that the protest be
declared without grounds and that the
Olympic Club be allowed to keep the cup.
He made this motion before the Acme
Club had gotten In half of its evidence,
In fact before the case had been given a
hearing. Hynes rose to a point of order
| and said that Jerome's motion was out
of order for the reason that the investi
gation of. the protest had not been com
pleted. The chair sustained Hynes and
Jerome took an appeal. On the vote the
: Acme, Bay City and Encinal clubs voted
i together, while the other clubs of the
, association voted with Jerome, and his
! motion was held to be in order by a large
majority.
This showed what the vote would be
on the motion itself, and Hynes, seeing
that his case was lost, got up and de
' nounced the Olympic Club's abortive use
|of Its majority as "damnable," and
; Adams replied that the Olympics were
! having a turn at the bat, for they had
known what it was in their time to be up
against a majority.
The chair at this juncture was power
less to stop the exchange of nasty per
sonalities. Hvnes. Hill and Fahrbach,
with the members of the Acme, Bay City
and Encinal clubs, left the meeting" prior
to the taking of the vote, first having ex
pressed their opinion of the tactics adopt
ed by the majority.
When the vote was cast the chairman
and Adams voted against it, and it must
be said in favor of Adams that he was in
favor of allowing the Acme Club to finish
its investigation.
Jerome, in addressing the chair prior to
the taking of the vote, declared with a
repulsive oath that the California Asso
ciated Cycling Clubs was going to .
PUNISHING DEER-SLAYERS,
Mendocino County Officials Hot
After the Law-Breakers.
The State Board of Fish and Game
Commissioners Is well pleased with the
work of A. V. La Mott, one of its dep
uties in charge of the fish hatchery near
I'kiah, who is breaking up a gang of deer
killers in that section of the State. For
years it has been the habit of a number
of unprincipled fellows to begin the
slaughter of deer before the opening of
the season, which begins on July 15 and
lasts until October 15. Mr. La Mott in
formed the Commissioners that when
these parties started out this year he
would make things interesting for them,
and the first move to this end was the
appointment of a Game Warden.
Last week the slaughter began and the
first arrest by the Warden took place on
the 25th lnst. The culprit was fined $30
for having deer meat in his possession.
Two days later two more of the same kind
of lawbreakers were gathered in for hav
ing deer meat and hides in their posses
sion, and they were fined $40 each. On
Wednesday Mr. La Mott sent the follow
ing relative to another arrest:
Yesterday our private warden brought in the
fourth deer-slayer, who pleaded guilty and re
ceived a sentence of forty days or $40. This
makes the fourth for the last week and he Is
on the trail of more to-day. The Justice Is
getting his war paint on and declares that
he will raise the fine on every one brought be
fore him hereafter. until he reaches the legal
limit. Hereafter (at my request) all meats,
hides, etc.. will be confiscated. The people are
warming up to their work well. Respectfully
â  ALFRED V. ; LA MOTT. '

NETTED A NEAT AMOUNT.
The Eureka Society Benefited by Its
Initial Entertainment.
The Eureka Society for the Protection
of Children netted a round sum by its
initial benefit entertainment given last
evening in the Young Men's Christian
Association's Auditorium. The hall was
comfortably filled with an appreciative
audience.
Of the many clever people who partici
pated in the entertainment the specialties
contributed by diminutive Dody Scholz
were the best. The sweet little lady won
the hearts of her audience by her clever
ness and she was repeatedly recalled.
Miss Bertha Wadham's singing also re
ceived kind approval and she was the re
cipient of numerous floral offerings. Fol
lowing is the complete programme:
Overture, Professor Graeber's mando
lin guitar and banjo orchestra; address
by ' Charles Montgomery, president of the
Eureka Society for the Protection of Chil
dren; song, selected. Miss Bertha Wad
ham (Professor H. Brrtherick, accompan
ist); orchestra; specialties. Mr. and Mrs.
Stainley; recitation. Miss Mary G. Ingli.s,
pupil of the California School of Oratory;
song. "The Island of Dreams" (Stephen
Adams), Mrs. H. Lewis (Professor Joseph

SHE TOOK THE CORSETS.
Arrest of Julia Van Horn on a Charge
of Petty Larceny.
A well-dressed middle-aged woman
: named Julia van Horn was arrested last
; night on complaint of B. Croner a corset
manufacturer at 231 Powell street an -I
charged with petty larceny. According
to ( roner the woman entered his place of
â¢ bnsiness and asked one of the salesladies
I to exchange a pair of corsets, which =he
had purchased several days ago Shf
placed the newly bought article on the
counter, and being unable to select a suit
able pair she demand, d that the money
she had paid for them be refunded
The saleslady refused to return the
amount, but offered to allow her to search
the stock for a suitable pair of corsets
Just then, it is assorted. Mrs. Van Horn
picked up the corseis Bhe had bought
as well as another pair, valued at $8 50
j and started to leave the place. The sales
lady followed her and, failing to induce
the woman to surrender the goods she
had taken from the counter, seized her.
A short struggle followed, during which
Mrs. Van Horn was scratched on the left
cheek. Policeman Baxter was attracted
to the scene by the conflict and he placed
Mrs. Van Horn under arrest. After being
formally charged she declared her inten
tion of filing a suit for heavy damages
against Croner for false imprisonment
She was at once released on $50 cash baiil

MILITARY USURPATION.
THE army and navy of the United States, even
during our Civil War. with all its necessities and
with all its opportunities, have been singularly
free from dernagogism. The curt incisiveness and
of military and of naval dispatches
ai 1 proclamations have furnished continuous evi
e that there were two branches of the public ser
vice entirely free from the petty rivalries and the
loos< . â¢ passion and to prejudice that fre
quently disgrace politics.
But it seems our smooth and even record in this
direction is to be broken. Already imperialistic ten
dencies have attracted public vigilance. Now a com
mand ral of the American army has clearly
ited official propriety. In a lengthy telegram to
the id - ral, sent from Manila by General
Otis, he makes the following bid for imperialistic
.rv: "The only hope of the insurgent leaders is
Unit id. They proclaim the near overthrow
of th administration, to be followed by their
nee and recognition by the United States.
This is the influence which enables them to hold
â 
This language is reprehensible in every line. Tt as
sumes km if an administrative policy that has
r been avowed, that has been frequently repu
diated, and that would be inconsistent with the prin
ciples and with the practice of the Government. What
the policy of the administration may be is absolutely
no concern of an army officer charged with the duty
eeting temporary military exigencies. But, even
if this infraction of discipline could be overlooked.
President McKinley and his Cabinet have uttered no
word, directly or indirectly, to indicate even a de-ire
to retard the civil independence and the political
recognition of the Filipinos. The Call has often vin
ted them from this unjust aspersion, common
enough in partisan newspapers but not to be antici
-1 from a general in the American service. The
â¢i Democracy has labored hard to fasten the
charge of imperialism upon the Republican party, so
â¢ â¢ monopolize the constitutional side of that ques
in 1900. But all such efforts so far have been
fruitless. The Republican party has adopted no such
heterodox position, and in the State platform in Ohio
has taken the soundest American ground upon the
Philippine situation.
It .vas, doubtless, unintentional but none the less
distinctly unfair and unjust, apart from its breach of
military rules, for General Otis to have thus mis
represented the intentions of the Government, now
controlled under the constitution and the laws by a
Republican administration. But, in other ways, his
expressions were not merely indiscreet, but offensive.
I>i es he suppose that a censorship, presumed to be
momentarily essential to Manila and used as a prece
dent for the usurpations in Idaho, can be extended
over the entire American press, and the whole Ameri
can people? If he floes, then his attitude at least cor
responds to the imperialism of General Merritt. who
declared that our constitutional system had been "out
grown." He should have remembered that Spanish
absolutism has no application to the United States
and that every American citizen in the Philippines,
whether in the regular army or among the volunteers,
stands upon an exact political equality with himself,
rind, though as a soldier willingly amenable to mili
tary discipline, is absolutely entitled to entertain and
it; Miitable places to express his opinion of the rela
tions that ought to exist between his country and the
tic archipelago. When, however. General Otis
virtually denies to our citizens at home the right of
thinking and speaking, within the limits of the con
stitution, with unrestrained freedom, he shows him
self incapable of comprehending an independence that
it cost our forefathers a bloody revolution to acquire
and their successors an immense expenditure of
money and of life to preserve.
General Otis should have been more accurately ad
vised also with respect to the Filipino leaders them
selves. They have repeatedly shown an intelligent
knowledge of American institutions. They are per
fectly aware that an American administration, unlike
a British Ministry, is not subject to "overthrow" ex
cept by the expiration of official terms and through
the exercise of the elective franchise. And it may
be safely assumed that there is not a man among
them so ignorant as to imagine that his native land
will receive from the United States, or from any part
of its population, the only "aid" that could tend to
extricate it from our military and naval grasp.
Spanish pronunciamentos were usually "sound and
fury, signifying nothing." The politics of General
Otis are less harmless and display an inaptitude that
might justify his recall or at least an official rebuke.
Or. Walter B. Coffey seems to have inflicted an
unnecessary annoyance upon himself in being vac
cinated. He appears to have been very thoroughly
inoculated with the Burns virus.
ACROSS THE CONTINENT IN AN
AUTOMOBILE.
AS was announced yesterday, The Call, in associa
tion with the New York Herald, has arranged
for a trip across the continent by the latest i
nchievement of art and science in the way of transpor- |
tatior â the automobile.
The start will be made on July i from the Herald!
office, and every mile of the journey will be made by '
the machine. Its capability for speedy and long dis
! tance traveling will be tested not only on the average'
highways of well settled American communities but j
j across the deserts, where the roads are little more than |
trails, and up and down the mountains, where the
grades are'in many places so steep as to be almost'
I recipitous.
By such a journey the usefulness of the automobile
: will be subjected to a severe and thorough test. The |
' trip is therefore one which will mark the opening of \
! a new epoch in the history of transportation. In its
I way it will be as notable as the running of the first j
I locomotive across the continent. It will demonstrate
the prrnt value of the machine to the American pub- i
i he and go far toward hastening the day when its wide
j and general use will. effect something like a revolu- j
â  tion in our methods of traveling.
It is well known that successive stages of civilization
are marked by improved means of transportation
; m. ire than by any other single factor. In fact, noth- i
' ing else so profoundly or so widely affects the trade,
the industry and the social life of a community as the -
j opening of new facilities for traveling and for the
I transportation of freight Every accomplishment in â 
that direction, from the construction of a wagon road i
through a wilderness to the. opening ;of the great Suez i
canal, has in pr/oportioq to its extent changed the'
whole life of the people affected by it. Something
more than a passing sensation, therefore, will result
from the first transcontinental trip of the automobile. !
The new machine is as yet in its infancy. The test
'â  now to be made will reveal its detects for use in long ;
! journeys a> well as its advantages, and will therefore 1
! be instrumental in bringing about the improvements i
needed to render it more valuable and more conve
i nient than at present. Thus the experiment is of ;
j scientific importance as well as of general interest, and
is sure to lead to important and far-reaching results.
No attempt will be made either by The Call or the
; Herald to exaggerate the daily events of the journey j
into a summer's sensation. The enterprise is not a !
; yellow journal freak. It i- an undertaking for the pur- ;
; pose of testing the availability of the automobile for
! general use in all parts of the United States and on
roads of all kinds. It is. therefore, an experiment in ,
the interests of s the public and will be so treated from s
1 start to finish. Every event of the trip will be re- !
| ported daily with absolute fidelity, and an elaborate
and careful review of each week's journey will be \
1 given in The Sunday Call. Thus the public will be
kept fully posted as to the working of the machine :
i under all sorts of conditions and along all sorts of
highways, and every intelligent reader can thus be in
a position to judge for himself of its practical value.
The automobile to be used for the trip is of Ameri
can manufacture. It has heen constructed not for the
! purpose of racing on level, well paved roads, but for
t'.?e on roads of all. kinds, nnd yet it is expected to
make a speed record that the nation can be proud of.
Mr. and Mrs. Davi>, who are to make the .journey,
are skilled in the use of the machine and can be relied
upon to make the experiment in a thoroughly satis
factory manner. The day for the start will soon
come, and from that time on until the automobile and
its passengers arrive at The Call building its pro- â 
gress will be watched with interest all over the civil
ized world.
FOOD ADULTERATIONS IN ENGLAND.
LJOWEYER varied and extensive may be the
j I adulterations brought to light by the investiga
tions of the Pure Food Committee of the Sen
ate, it is not likely the disclosures will show anything
worse in this country than what has been re
vealed in Great Britain. In fact, the use of chemicals
to give a good appearance to decayed meats and vege
tables is about as wide as civilization itself. Were the
press of Continental Europe as free in its strictures
as is that of the United States and Great Britain, we
should doubtless learn that the manufacture of im
pure foods is as common there as with us. though
such articles are not so openly exposed for sale, ow
ing to the strictness ni the governmental inspection.
The London Lancet, in discussing the manufacture
and sale of impure foods in England, recently pointed
out that revelations made in certain cases which have
been before the public during the last year disclose
that animal substances were actually about to be em
ployed in making meat extracts in which the putre
factive process has made a fair start, and went on to
say: "Of course cooking would destroy most noxious
germs, but their products, the poisonous ptomaines
would remain. Indeed, if the poisonous ptomaines
were elaborated, they would be difficult to destroy."
It is recognized in Great Britain, as here, that the
manufacture of food out of such stuff works the
greater injury to the public, inasmuch as it tends, by
reason of its cheapness, to drive pure foods out of the
market. Thus, if anything like a free field be left for
the dishonest manufacturer to compete with the hon
est producer of good and wholesome articles, the ad
vantages of the competition will be altogether on the
side of the adulterator.
It is said that the exposure of the embalmed beef
scandals in this country injured the entire meat
packing trade, and that the innocent suffered with the
guilty. That, of course, is an evil which every one
regret?. Fortunately, it is likely to be of but short
duration. In the end it will redound to the benefit
of honest dealers and manufacturers, to have the sale
of impure foods prevented by reason of the exposure
of the wrong.
From the experience of Great Britain it appears
there will be required a most stringent inspection and
supervision to suppress the iniquitous business. The
Lancet says: "A system of control should be estab
lished by the State, and imported extracts
and extracts made at home should be ex
amined chemically and bacteriologically from
time to time, while a very vigorous watch
should be maintained on the disposal of offal and all
such nastiness. In any case, on the conviction of a
man wicked enough to attempt to retail a meat ex
tract for public consumption which he knew had been
prepared from putrid substances, the punishment
should be made to fit the crime."
We can hardly expect a comprehensive national in
spection in this country, but it is reasonable t.Â» hope
for something at least in the way of legislation to
check the adulteration of food. It is believed that a
law requiring all packages of food to be labeled cor
rectly as to the nature of the article, the place and
date of packing, with the name of the packers, would
put an end to some of the worst features of the prac
tice, and such an act ought to be provided by Con
gress at the coining session.
There is grim satire in the appointment of a garbage
inspector by the Board of Health. The position, in
all seriousness, is a political one for politicians.
THE SAN FKANCISCO (ALL, FRIDAY, JUNE 30, 1899.
WILL QUAY BE SEATED?
WE publish a canvass of United States Senators
made by The' Call on the seating of Quay.
The first notable revelation of the canvass is
that Jones, chairman of the Bryan Democratic Na
tional Committee; Hanna, chairman of the Republican
National Committee, and Butler, chairman of the
Populist National Committee, all join in supporting
Quay. When three politicians, at the head of the
committees of the three parties, join in such action it
is indicative of some sort of deal in which little
thought may be Riven to any constitutional principle
involved. Of the thirty-three votes slated for Mr.
Quay four are Democratic â Jones, Bate, Martin and
Daniel â and three are by silver Republicans â Teller,
Jones of Nevada and Stewart. This leaves twenty
six straight Republicans for Quay and eleven against
him, with thirteen straight Republicans doubtful or
undeclared. Senator Hoar is the leading name among
the supporters of Quay. He has always held, in case
of like contests, that the constitution, by saying that
a State shall not be deprived of equal suffrage in the
Senate except by its consent, means that the Senate
shall be always full, and that when a Legislature fails
to elect, the Governor has the constitutional right to
appoint, to the end that the Senate may be full and
the State have its equal suffrage therein. So believ
ing, it is a matter of principle with the venerable j
Senator from Massachusetts to support Quay. His i
position raises some very interesting issues. The con
stitution plainly makes the Legislature the represen- I
tative of the State in the election of a Senator, and !
provides that when it is in recess and cannot act the j
Governor may make a temporary appointment, which |
ceases and determines when the Legislature meets !
again.
Now, if the Legislature, when in session, represent
ing the State as the electorate of a Senator, omit for
reasons seeming to it good to elect, the State has
thereby consented to forego, for the time being, its i
equal suffrage in the Senate.
It was not the intention of the constitution that
there should be left open a possible collusion between '
Legislatures and Governors, by which the Senate
could be filled with appointed Senators and the elec- j
torate be practically shifted from the Legislature to (
the Governor. Senators Spooner and Davis have held !
the same opinion as Senator Hoar. Quay himself held ,
the opposite opinion and voted against seating Cor- j
bett.
Senator Shoup of Idaho, who is a native of Perm- !
sylvania and is affected by the party feuds that rage
in his birthplace, seems to pass all questions of con
stitutional construction and jump into the middle of
the personalities involved. He desires to vindicate
Mr. Quay against the charges made by the reform
ers in the Republican party of his State. This view of j
the subject is not tenable, and but few Senators will
admit that their votes will be influenced by it.
It is evident that Quay has not the majority in hand
that was supposed to be ready to seat him. This
being the case, there is likely to be a long fight and
a most interesting debate.
So much attention has been attracted to the matter
by events in Pennsylvania that we may expect the ;
entire subject to be thrashed out For the sake of
the Senate's dignity and the security of the country
it is to be hoped that the decision will rest upon con
stitutional conclusions and not on a desire to seize '
an unnecessary' advantage or to get even with a fight
ing faction in the party.
THE BOARD OF HEALTH SCANDAL
BY a scries of appointments which amount to
public scandal, the Board of Health at its meet
ing on Tuesday made itself known as a part of
the Burns machine and turned its offices over to his
henchmen. After this it is probable the. scandals will
follow thick and fast, for what else can be expected
of a board whose secretary is notoriously disreputable
and whose other appointees are tit associates of that
creature of the tenderloin?
The former Board of Health was notably earnest in
its work and rendered the city important service. The
fight undertaken against the sale of impure food and
carried on with such zeal and success by Food In
spector Dockery was in the highest degree beneficial.
It went far toward preventing the sale of impure milk
and other articles of food that spread perms () f dis
ease among the households of the community, and
thus saved many a family from sickness among it^
members and probably from death itself
The new board, as if with a deliberate intention to
give notice that it will not carry on the work of the
former board â as if to notify dishonest milkmen and
grocerymen that they may with impunity resume the
sale of impure and diseased foods â removes Inspector
Dockery from the office which he has filled with so
much credit and bestows it upon a man utterly un- I
skilled in the work which the office requiresâ one
who has no other claim upon it than that of having
as an Assemblyman voted for Dan Burns for the
United States Senate.
It is not to Burns only, however. that the board has
sacrificed the welfare of the community and the in
terests of the people. The railroad bosses have
claimed their share of the spoils, and the members of
the board, being themselves physicians in the pay of
the road, have been prompt to comply with the claim.
The result is a series of appointments which the pub
lic can regard with nothing less than amazement and
indignation.
As was pointed out in The Call yesterday, two
members of the board. Dr. Coffey and Dr. Payne, are
physicians of the railroad company. Dr. Barbat is the
physician of Dan Burns, and Dr. Kecney is essentially
a political doctor. They have put railroad doctors on
guard at every point under control of the board. The
city physician and the assistant city physician are both
in the service of the railroad people. To the positions
of assistant police surgeons there have been appointed
men who are either in the service of the Southern Pa
cific or the Market Street Railway Company, or are
closely related to physicians that are.
These men are therefore in positions where they can
guard the interests of the railroad company whenever
any victim of railroad negligence or violation of law
is carried to the Receiving Hospital; It is safe to say
they will perform whatever work the railroad or Dan
Burns requires of them, for it is for that they have
been appointed.
From a Board of Health so directed and so offi
cered nothing can be expected of benefit to the pub
lic. The board appears to have organized itself as a
machine to do politics of the lowest kind for the low
est purposes and for tire lowest persons. It would be
folly for the Supervisors to appropriate any consider
able sum of money for a board so constituted and so
open in its contempt for the public welfare. The
health of the city, moral as well as physical, will
suffer rather than be helped by every dollar placed at
the disposal of such a board.
Only one legitimate argument has been advanced
against free tuition at the University of California.
Governor Gage is in favor of it.
The Boers are said to be exceptionally expert in
hunting lions. They are hunting one now that may
be more than a match for them.
THE JURY IN
WELBURN'S CASE
DID NOT AGREE
The Vote Stood Eight
for Acquittal.
A TALE OF BASE INGRATITUDE
ACCUSED MAN HAD BEFRIEND
ED HIS INFORMER.
He Saved From Prosecution William
Davis, Suspected of Stealing a
Sack of Internal Rev
enue Coin.
The jury in the case of Osca M. Wel
burn, the ex-Internal Revenue Collector,
on trial for forgery and embezzlement.
(ailed to agree and was discharged yester
day afternoon at 2:30 o'clock by Justic. de
Haven in the United States District Court.
The jury had been out since Wednesday
evening at G o'clock, and stood eight for
acquittal and four for conviction. It is
said that three of the latter were willing
to vote for acquittal, but the persistency
of Juror William <i. Ayers caused thorn to
stand by their original intention. One of
the reasons ascribed for Ayers' stub
bornnesa Is said to be the chatting he was
subjected to by his colleagues when he
desired to know who "Mr. Jurat was, any
how?" The attorneys had referred to the
"jurat," or sworn oath, several times in
tht! course of the trial. Throughout the
deliberations Ayers was addressed as "Mr.
Jurat.' and became much incensed there
at. Juror Maurice Henry, who voted for
acquittal, was heard to remark in the
hallway after the discharge of the jury
that he knew ex-Deputy Loupe, one of
the witnesses for the prosecution, and he
"would not take his word for anything."
The I'nited States District Attorney in
tends to ask the Department of Justice at
\\ ashington for further instructions in
the case, but it is thought that a new
trial will be ordered. It is quite likely
that ;i second trial will result in an ac
quittal and Welburn will be permitted to
carry out his laudable intention to redeem
himself in the service of his country-
A bald cast- of ingratitude on the part
of a man whom Welburn saved from go
ing to prison has just come to light. It
will be remembered that Welburn was
apprehended on the information of Wil
liam Davis, a negro expressman, who h.is
his wagon stand in front of the Ap
praiser's building on Washington street-
When Welburn arrived In this city from
Galveston in charge of a squad of nine
recruits he was recognized as he was en
tering the International Hotel by Davis'
son. Tiie latter, who was under the Im
pression .hat there was a reward of $S(M
for Welburn's capture, told his father of
Welburn's presence in the city, and the
old man, forgetting the former kindness
of Welburn to himself and son, informed
Hurt Thomas, the special agent of the
revenue department. The ungrateful part
played by Davis and his son in the affair
may be understood from the following
story:
The elder Davis was employed by the.
Internal Revenue < 'trice to haul the coin
receipts to the sub treasury. Two deliv
eries are made daily, one' at noon and
th< other at 4 o'clock. i>n December 1.
1893, Collector Quinn turned the office over
to his successor, WHhurn. and whil â  ill"
transfer was taking place word was
brought to them that a sack containing
$600 had mysteriously disappeared from
the wagon on the noon delivery. It was
known that the senior Davis had driven
the vehicle, and on the seat with him at
the time was his son. The men we-e im
mediately suspected, detectives were
placed on the case and the sack of money,
minus some thirty dollars, was locate"d
under Davis' house.
Hnd Welburn been so inclined he could
have prosecuted the men, but he was dis
posed to be lenient, and actually allowed
Davis to continue- hauling the money,
though he w;is always accompanied by an
officer of the Internal Revenue Depart
ment.
"U'eiburn's kindness was poorly repaid
as is now known. It Is worthy of note
that there was no reward for Wei burn's
apprehension, and so the Davis family
will pain nothing by their perfidy to on.*
who certainly deserved hotter treatment
at thpir hands even from motives of the
commonest gratitude.

Chris Schneider Declares He Was

AROUND THE
CORRIDORS
JIM O'BRIEN and Steve Costello were
sitting in the office of the Fourth of
July Committee one afternoon Just
before the advent of the big scandal,
speculating on the probabilities of obtain
ing a small cold bottle at the expense or
Colonel Robinson, when the boy brought
in a card and handed it to O'Brien.

"I have heard considerable of the power
of these fellows," said he, "but this is
the first opportunity I ever had of testing

The boy departed, and in a few minutes
returned with a well dressed stranger,
who had nothing distinctive about him
except a pair of strangely glittering eyes,
an enormous red beard and a tremendous
length of body from the hips up.
Briefly announcing that he wished to
exhibit his accomplishments for the edifi
cation of the Grand Marshal, he took
from his pocket a seven-foot rattler and
threw it on the floor. Costello and
O'Brien fought with each other for pos
session of the top of the wardrobe,
while the typewriter, executing a giant
swing, landed on the gas fixture, where
she remained, positively refusing the in
vitation of the professor to come down
and fondle his little pet.
The stranger made a few passes and
the snake commenced to perform its
tricks. He made it stand up, lie down,
beg, play dead, waltz and jump through
his hands, finally . compelling it to put
Its tail in its mouth, swallow Itself and
disappear completely from the sight of
the bewildered spectators. Then, with
the bow of a Chesterfield, he picked up
the nothing that remained on the floor
and departed.
The stranger was Stevens, the hyp
notist, disguised in a false beard, and the
snake was his cane, which he threw on
the floor. "When last seen, Costello and
O'Brien were still perched on top of the
wardrobe, signing the pledge, which was
being handed to them by a boy on a
stepladder. â¢ The typewriter has resigned.

How much of the Twenty-fourth In
fantry Is going to the Philippines a- A
how much will stay home is the subject
of considerable discussion at the Presidio
just now. Four companies have gone;
there are eight more, and all of them
have at one time or another been booked
for the islands, but it is considert-1
pretty certain that only two battalion;,
will be sent out and the third will be kept
here as a recruiting organization for fill
ing the ranks of the companies at the
front.
Such a plan is followed by European
regiments, but they are generally of four
battalions. Three of these are put In the
field and the fourth, known as the "home
battalion," remains behind, gathers men
and trains them, and these are sent out
as the fortunes of the battalions on ac
tive service require. This country is tak
ing its first lesson in foreign warfare and
there Is much to learn, but the drift of
events seems to indicate that the Euro
pean plan will be copied to the extent of
the "home battalion."
In. the case of the Twenty-fourth In
fantry, this way of handling the regiment
may mean the retention of Colonel Free
man, who has twice been ordered to Ma
nila and who is still here. His first order
was to go on the Pennsylvania; then he
was ordered off the Pennsylvania and to
the Valencia; then followed an order de
taching him from the Valencia, and it
was understood that he would not go out
until the last of his regiment was on the
way. Now it looks as If the last of his
regiment will remain in this country un
less emergency requires otherwise.
In the case of the Twenty-fifth Infan
try, also colored, companies B and F are
doing the recruiting. Colonel Burt and
250 men of the Twenty-fifth are now on
their way here overland, and these will
probably start for the islands as soon as
possible, but B and F will remain here
until they have both been recruited up
to the numoer required by the last act
of Congress, which fixÂ«*s the strength of
a company at 128 men. It is exptcted that
the recruits will be trained and shipped
on as the Twenty-fifth needs them.
Major C. H. Noble and over 100 men of
the Twenty-fourth are also bound over
land for the Presidio.
The headquarters band and six com
panies of the Twenty-fifth Infantry, with
130 white recruits, have been assigned to
the transport Pennsylvania, which is
booked to sail on the 30th inst. Lieutenant
Colonel Charles A. Coolidge, Xinth In
fantry, will be in command of the de
tachment and ho will have with him Ma
jor W. H. W. James of the Twenty-third
Infantry and Captain William H. John
ston of the Sixteenth Infantry. In addi
tion, eighty colored recruits will be sent
on the same vessel. Acting Assistant Sur
geon Nevil M. Garrett. now at tne general
hospital at the Presidio, has been assigned
to duty on the transport Pennsylvania.
Assistant Surgeon I. C. Fauntleroy and
Acting 1 Assistant Surgeon J. C. Garling
ton, who had been ordered to duty on
the Pennsylvania, have been .detached
from the vessel and have been ordered to
report to the commanding officer of the
Twenty-fourth Infantry for duty with
that regiment and to accompany it to the
Philippines.
Captain M. J. I,enihan. quartermaster
of the Twenty-fifth, has been ordered on
board the Pennsylvania at once to pre
pare for the reception of the regiment.
The Army and Navy Journal has this to
say of the prospects of Lieutenant John
M. Neall. recently tried by court-martial
at the Presidio Tor the misappropriation
of funds:
It was unofficially stated In Washington this
week that Lieutenant John M. Neall of 1 the
Fourth Cavalry, who was tried by court
martial recently on the Pacific Coast for mak
ing way with funds not his own, would be dis
missed from the army. It was stated that the
findings of the court have been approved by
the President and the dismissal of Lieutenant
Neall directed. The strongest kind of political
pressure by Influential Western politicians was
brought to bear on the President In behalf of
this officer, but without apparent effect. Among
those said to have asked for clemency were
Senator Stewart and John W. Mackay.
The Army and Navy Journal may be
correct, but there are many who believe
Neall will be given a chance to redeem
himself while the finding of the court,
which was for dismissal, is pocketed.

The Republican County Committee can
not affcirfi to mince matters In dealing
with .T. M. Chretien. If he does not resign
from the executive committee promptly
and without ceremony he should be quick
ly displaced. If he does not at once re
sign from the general body known as the
Republican County Committee he should
be Instantly expelled. There are some of
fenses that decent citizens will not toler-
Bto or condone and one of these is graft-
IfiK !n the name of patriotism. Chretien
Btanfls convicted of using his position on
the' Fourth of July committee to extort
for his own use money contributed for
patriotic purposes. Prompt expulsion
from the committee followed the proof of
.his guilt.
The members of the Republican County
Commin- . should perceive at once that
Chretiens membership can bring to the
organization nothing but disgrace and re
proach. A clean campaign cannot be ;
conducted by unclean men. Chretien has
no sense of moral responsibility and Is
utterly destitute of patriotic principle.
Fie is an unprincipled grafter, who preys
lpon his friends and rnemlw alike. The
sooner the county committee gives him ;
h's passport the better it will be for the.
p rty and the community.
The meeting- last night was called to

committee. The rollcall showed an at
tendance of fifty-eight, which was a quo
rum, and then the little business of the
evening began. But one committee had
anything to report, and that was only in
the way of labor done for the committee
on the apportionment of delegates.
Ruff acted as spokesman, He said that
the committee had not been able to reach
a unanimous opinion as to a plan of ap
portionment, and suggested that the re
port be laid over for a week. This was j
put In the form of a motion and was !
tarried, ? Savage was called upon for an I
that it should be done away with. At the

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JUNE 30. 1899.
TO ASSUME CONTROL OF
SACRED HEART PARISH
NUMEROUS friends of Father Lagan, who has boon so lonp klentifW
with xhf Roman r.-itholic parish of Snn Rafael, will be gratified to
learn that the popular priest has been promoted to the pastorate <>f
the Sacred Heart in this city. Sacred Heart parish is one of great
importance, and only those of tried ability are ever appointed by the
Archbishop to Its control. Rev. Father Hugh Lagan was born at
Londonderry, Ireland, forty-nine years up.". He received his early education
in the national schools of his native plac, going from there to the Catho
lic seminary at Maynooth, where he wen through the prescribed theolog
ical course and was ordained a priest.
He remained In Inland but a Bhort time ns priest, brine only 2fi years
of age when he arrived in this city and took up his il ut i.s as assistant pas
tor at the cathedral. From the cathedral he \\'i>t to thn parish of St. Jo
seph, whence he was promoted to the pastorate of San Rafael, where 1 ir- has
been for the last nine or ten years.
The ability of Father Lagan could not possibly have been made more
manifestly apparent than It is in the difference between the parish of Ran
Rafael as h< now leaves it and as it was when he first went there.
Then the church was little more than a ham and the pastorate a shed. To
day the church of San Rafael is one of tho handsomest st ih.m u rÂ«>s of its size
outside the city; good schools have been established and there is a convent,
second to no educational institution in the State, which is also the work of
the d( parting priest.
While all will rejoice at Father Lagan's g 1 fortune, yet t.> his parishon
ers across the bay the joy will be tempered with a profound regret at los
ine a spiritual t;i ii<l>- whose numerous acts of kindness have endeared him to
i!i. hearts of every one. There is another community who will miss the
po.ni priest, also a community of outcasts, who by their acts are supposed
to have forfeited all right to consideration or consolation of any kind. Hut
Father Lagan in the broadness of his views could never see it that way. it
is t â  <l<i in Kan 'jut-nthi thai none have entered its gates who were so low
ded as t.i be overlooked and none have yet been 'found who were so
hardened as to withstand the kindness of his charity.

THE MAYOR'S SELF-INTEREST
WHY HE FAVORED THE LOOP
FRANCHISE.
The Railroad Secures From the Com
mittee Every Valuable Conces
sion It Sought Except the
Geary-Street One.
The Street Committee of the Board of
Supervisors took a most unexpected
and, at first glance, mysterious action
yesterday In reference to street rail
road franchises. Investigation subse
quently proved, however, that the com
mittee had a very thoroughly defined
purpose in what it did. Every franchise
asked by the Market-street Railroad
Company, with the exception of that
on Geary street and two unimportant
ones in Richmond, were recommended
for adoption by the board. The commit
tee was in a satirical mood and sarcas
tically urged the representatives of the
railroad to wait awhile and they might
even get the Geary-street franchise.
The members of the committee were
disgusted at an unexpected turn of
events in reference to the franchises.
Mayor Phelan had thrust himself into
the affair and, what appears to be from
a purely personal, selfish motive, had
attempted to gain certain concessions.
The granting of these concessions
meant a jeopardy of the crosstown rail
road and the Street Committee took
such measures as they deemed neces
sary to protect this road to the mer
chants.
"When the corkscrew franchise was
offered for sale the Grant avenue and
Bush street loop was not Included in
the franchise. It was not wanted by
merchants and formed no proper part
of the crosstown railroad. An amend
ment proposing it was therefore de
feated at the last meeting of the board.
Then a sudden revival in its favor took
place. If it can be offered for sale next
Monday it will still be within the power
of the board to grant.
Since the meeting of the board which
was held on Monday a petition favoring
the loop has been circulated. People of
prominence and influence who have no
possible interest in the matter have
been importuned by representatives of
Mayor Phelan to indorse the loop and
expatiate upon its advantages. The
same representatives have sought sig
natures to the petition and it was not
long before the reason became known.
Mayor Phelan has personal private
reasons for urging the adoption of the
franchise. The Phelan estate owns
some property on Grant ayenue and the
loop that will not be of general benefit

surf about half a mile south of the
pier. Around, the neck was tightly tied
a Turkish towel, one end of which was
tiod around the handle of a four-pound
flatiron. The forehead and temples
were scratched from the rubbing
against tho sandy beach, but no other
marts of injury wore discovered on
the body.
Mr. Botcher Is an upholsterer by
trade. He Informed the Coroner that
his wife had been suffering for ' the
past six or eight months- with a break
ing-down of the nervous system. This
brought on stomach trouble also, and
the poor woman was during the
greater part of the time in misery and
subject to spells of melancholia. A
short time ago he took her to her
folks in Stockton, in the expectation
that a change of air and scene would
improve her condition; but she be
came worse and he was obliged to go
to Stockton last Tuesday to bring her
home. They returned on Wednesday,
and, being fatigued with the journey,
retired at half-past 9 o'clock in the
evening. â ..:-: .' <
The dead woman was 33 years old
and was reared and. educated in the
city of Stockton. She was Miss Lizzie
Flland up to five years ago, when she
married Mr. Botcher.
Will be of special advantage to the Phe
lan estate.
Members of the Street Committee
learned of these facts and acted accord
ingly. Since a selfish Interest of the
Mayor could do so much the Street
Committee determined t" do more In
order to checkmate tin 1 Mayor. By
granting 1 everything the railroad people
asked the members of the committee
saw that the whole affair would lÂ«- re
duced to an absurdity aivl the members
r)f the board would give nothing that
was asked.
This policy was accordingly adopted
by the committee at the meeting yes
terday. The members recommended
the following franchises for adoption:
Grant avenue and Post street on Grant
avenue to Hush and on Bush t<> San
some street; Stockton street from Pa
cific street to Broadway; dattery street
from California t" Sacramento stre< .
Stanyan street from Hayes to Fulfc n.
When the committee met the usual
delegation was in attendance. A. S.
Baldwin was there with the long peti
tion and an overflowing enthusiasm for
the Grant avenue loop. He told what
he has told so often and then gave
place to H. H. Taylor, who related
nothing new except that Father tuis
Indorsed the loop. There was practi
cally no discussion. Supervisoi Hol
land declared that since the Grant av< -
nue loop was to be Incorporated in the
franchise he suggested the Stockton
and Battery streets and Stanyan fran
chises.
"Can you think of anything else you ,
want, gentlemen?" he asked, turning
toward the representatives of the Mar
ket-street Railroad Company. 'Just
ask for it. Anything you like. Take the
Thirty-second avenue franchise and
that for Point Lobos. Take them all. |
If you wait awhile and we get some
more petitions y<>u might get the
Geary-street franchises."
The reference to a franchise on
Thirty-second avenue brought Colonel
Little to his feet with a protest. He
represents thÂ«- Sutro estate and the pro
posed franchise interferes with the Su
tro road. Holland was simply in a

test, sustaining Dr. Klnyon and directing
that the passengers be detained on \n

A CHINESE MURDERER
TAKES HIS OWN LIFE
SHEE HOO BEIN, the slayer of
Ng Sou Bheong, was found
early yesterday morning hang
ing by his neck from I lie liars in
his cell in the tanks of the City
Prison. He had committed suicide to
avoid the consequences of his crime.
The discovery of the deed was made
by Sergeant Bid will in making his
customary round of the prison. He
entered the corridor In which She
Hoo's cell was situated at 4:46 o'clock
and saw the upper part c,f the body of
the dead Chinese through the grating
In the cell door. A closer inspection
showed him that the prisoner had tied
one end of a silken sash, which nearly
all Chinese wear around their mid
dles, about his neck, haying previ
ously fastened the other end to a
crosspiece In the grating of the door.
Bidwlll called Policeman Raines
bury, who was acting as prison door
keeper, and between the two the Â«=st ill
warm body was cut down. A call w;is
sent to the Receiving Hospital and
Dr. Rice responded. He prom :â¢:â â . <i
the prisoner d< a.i and the body was
tak( h to the Morgue.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JUNE 30, 1899.
last Tuesday morning as the latter
lay Bleeping in his bunk In a house in
the rear of 227 ('lay street. For months
they had been fellow-workmen In the
cigar factory of Cerro, Howe & Co.,
and they were rivals for the fickle af
fections of Sing Goo, a Chinese slave
girl. : â¢". * : '-
A short time ago Shee lost his posi
tion and XÂ».r You got the place. This
caused a bitterness, which was In
creased when the slave girl, with a
coldly commercial eye. expressed her
preference for the man with a job.
L<'ss than this lias caused blood to
flow In Chinatown, and it was no sur
prise to their acquaintances that Slice
Ho,, Seln should kill Ng You Sheong.
The murderer confessed his crime
when captured, saying that he had
killed a man who had threatened to
kill him. He was taken yesterday
before Police Judge Treadwell. but as
the inquest had not been he.'d on his
victim the hearing was postponed a
week Slice Hoo Sein was taken bark
to his cell, whicti is next to that occu
pied by Wong Fu, held on a charge
of kidnaping his sister from a slave
dealer in order that she could marry
a tri. ii<!. To Wong. Rhee Hoo com
plained that he was lonesome and that
his bones ached. He did not. however,
say anything that the other construed
to indicate an intention to commit sui
cide.
The news of Shee Hoo Sein's tin
timely end wan received with surprise
in Chinatown, especially by the friends
of murdered Ng You. In some way
they became possesed of the thought
thai Shee Hoo Sc-in had not strangled
himself, but was shamming death in
order to make his escape later. Just
how they arrived at this conclusion
of wisdom. It Is said Father Collopy Is an orator, and this is borne out by rlie i
fact that he whs selected as orator of the day at the exercises held by St.
Mary's College during the. Midwinter Fair and the medals he has received for
ability In that art. He Is 28 years of age and a hard student, ills instructors
predict a brilliant future for him.
they did not explain. So firmly were
they of this opinion that a dozen of
thorn, engaging the services of Attor
ney H. C. Schaerrzer, called yester
day morning on Coroner Hill, insist
ing that the supposed suicide had
probably taken chloroform to simu
late death until such time as he might
he rescued by friends and spirited
away.
Coroner Hill was somewhat skeptical
of this information, but, to satisfy the
Chinese, he allowed them and their
attorney to inspect the corpse. They
descended to the cooling room, and
there uncovering the body they sub
jected it to all tests to determine
death known to the Celestial mind.
They worked Ihe lingers and toes of
the deceased, they pinched his cheeks
and ears, they held his arms high in
the air and they opened his eyelids,
but never a move made he, and
the delegation went away satis
fled that Shee Hoo Seln was dead
enough to suit an easy-going Coroner
â¦ike Dr. Hill, who, with a jury, had
just determined that Ng You Sheong
had been murdered by Shee Hoo Sein.

DUTY UNDER DIFFICULTIES.
Policeman's Trouble With a Prison
er, Her Friend, a Special
and a Crowd.
Policpman Charles Murphy created a
sensation on Sixth and Market streets last
night by his attempt* to make an arrest
In the face of unlooked for difficulties.
He had arrested a woman and was
standing with her at the patrol box when
she spied a friend and called for assist
ance. The friend cam.- forward promptly
and knocked the policeman down into a
cellarway and proceeded to kick him un
til Murphy drew his revolver, rh.n mo
man took to his heels down Sixth street
and Murphy gathered himself together
and started after him. He took one snot
but it missed. Murphy caught his man
after a hard chase, and then a man who
said be was a special came up to Murp 1/
and offered to help him.
The offer was accepted. Murphy turning
over his man and telling the special to
take him to the patrol box. Murphy was
in citizen's clothes, but he says he told
the special he, too, was an officer.
The special had not gone far when hia
charge escaped him and Murphy started
on the iving again. He caught his man
after another sprint, but this time the
crowd took a hand and released th pris
oner; the people also took the policeman's
revolver. There being nothing mur" t.j
arrest but the special Murphy took him
In and booked him on a charge of refus
ing to assist an officer. Murphy says the
special released the prisoner himself. The
special is Paul Smith. !!.â  Bays he did not
know Murphy was an officer.
DID NOT GO TO SIBERIA.
Party Reported to Have Perished Is
Camped Beyond Arctic
City.
A story has recently been circulated to
the effect that a party of miners who left
Nevada City some months agro to prospect
In the north had perished of cold and hun
ger in the wilds of Siberia.
The persistency with which the story
kept cropping: up finally led to its publica
tion In several papers and has occasioned
much uneasiness among friends and rela
tives of members of the party.
Mrs. Norval Douglass of this city, whoso
son is on? of the members of the party,
states most emphatically that there is no
truth In the story.
"The party never went to Siberia, nor
had any intention of goinp there." she
said. "As a matter of fact, they are now
camped about 300 miles beyond Arctic
City, with enough provisions to last them
through another season if necessary. It
is true that no messages have be^n re
ceived from them for several months, but
this is because they could not possibly
send one out. I confidently expect to hear
from my son about the middle of July.
I know "that I cannot hear from him be
fore that time."

[ h ahe has undoubtedly passed into
â â¢>i nd 88. She waa not
: :: to disclose her age, which cuts
figure in the case anyway.
The contrast between the two womenâ
me beloved by Charles Kopp, the
hi^ slayerâ was Btrongly brought
- their nearness .it the inquest.
l;H it nil Mrs. Kopp, who was hot
the stand, sat by the side of
her daughter, gazing mostly Into vacancy,
apparently taking no Interest In the pro
ceedings. Shr> looked and acted as one
tired i f lif.- anil waiting stolidly for the
end. On th ther hand, Mrs. Monti took
â¢he liveliest Interest in the proceedings.
he listened Intently while awaiting her
â  '.: the witness stand to the stories
â¢;. 9i who preceded her. Now and
. she gazed in the direction pt the
iw and her daughter, but never for
â¢ ligth of time. When she was called
â  -'^ik the stand readily, and, In ;ill
except where the questions touched
relations with Kopp, she answered
v ill a vÂ» ry sweet voice.
fcan ''oliins testified to the dr
eg surrounding the arrest and
-ion of Mrs. Kopp that sin- had
killed â  husband. Sergeant Shea cor
roboi ate the policeman.
"Mr.-. X >pp told me." ho said, "that
kill him; Bhe wanted him for
â¢ rsflf. '
Amanda X i.p. the daughter of the dead
::ian and the. prisoner, was the next %vlt
if-.ss. She is a bright-looking girl for her
14 ears and answered the questions put
to her without, my- particular display of
â¢motion and had no hesitancy in
ting the details of the tragedy and
'h<- family troubles that culminated in
*':â¢? ; hooting of her father. She said that
[.*\Â°P& had been very cruel to her mother
am, 'herself, often having threatened to
an<. several times trying to choke his
Â«''<'. <)n one occasion the girl testified,
when *hÂ« had < interfered to Have her

"My mother followed them," she said.

Amanda Kopp Bald that while she was
in -he room with her rather and mother
1.. : re the shooting she heard her mother
bog Kopp to return to her and leave that
woman alone.
"My father said he loved that woman " i
continued the witness "and that' she was '
the nicest woman he ever saw and that h<- '
wouid love her to the day of his death " ' '
The next thing the girl knew a shot had
been fired. She saw her mother place a !
smoking pistol on the table as her father i
fell to the floor dead. .
The girl also testified that her father i
and mother had not been living together
for some time before tho shooting, Kopp i
having a room In the house next door,
Â°Â«nilner In every, morning: to his own house I
for the breakfast the daughter cooked for :
him.
.Mrs. Sophia Koben. sister of the pris
oner, told of Mrs. Knpp's visit to her i
home Wednesday night with the story of I
the tragedy. The self-made widow hud '
told her then that she had to do it; that j
they had met the Monti woman. Mrs. |
Roben said that she had known for some
time of Kopp's Infatuation for Mrs.
Monti, he having told her on one occa
sion that he wan in love with Mrs. Monti
and that there was no woman like her.
"He told mo also," sa.d Mrs. R,.hen.
"that if be knew of some man to put on
to Mrs. Monti to' take care of her he '
would do so."
Mis. Roben also testitWi that while 1
Kopp's wife and uaughter were in the
Kast they were unable to set any money
from him for the return trip, and Mrs
Kopp was compelled to borrow.
When Mrs. Monti's name was called all
â ,â¢ cks were craned in her direction. She :
took the stand without the least fear,
and throughout her examination dis-
i played no signs of embarrassment. Her
story Was intended to throw ;t different
light on 'fit- shooting of Kopp than that
let In by the statements of the prisoner
and her daughter. In denying unlawful
â  â¢â ]< with the retired restaurant man.
Mrs. Monti attempted to show by her
testimony that the desire of Mrs. Kopp
â  back property she had deeded to
her husband, and not jealousy of her, was I
the impelling motive for the deed.
Mrs. Moi tl Bald she first mcl Kopp
â¢ nin< months ago in one of the- .
houHi s his wife then owned on Minna
She was looking for rooms at the
time ''! l was Introduced to Kopp by the â 
landlady "f the house. This was shortly
after the death of Mrs. Monti's husband.
The witness said she had accompanied
the defendant once to the Baldwin Thea- !
ter and accompanied him once or ,
to dinner. While Mrs. Kopp and
her daughter were East, Mrs. Monti said
she had rented a front parlor In their
hons,. from Kopp, he occupying the back
parlor, which was shut off by a folding
door. This door, Mrs. Niontl testified, j
was always locked. Several of the tÂ»-n- j
ants of the house, Mrs. Monti said, had
told her to be careful, as Mrs. Kopp was
.i verj jealous woman.
â lie waa the landlord." she said, "and 1
simply the tenant."
"Then," said Coroner Hill, "there wore
no other relations between you and Mr.'
Kopp than those of landlord nnd tenant?"
"I w.n-id have known It if there had
! een," sharply replied the witness with a
saucy toss of her head.
"1 'am Hrtking you for information."
said the Coroner. "Wire there any other
relations?" Mrs. Monti perked her head
at this question after the manner of a
parrot taken l>y surprise and looked de
fiantly at the Coroner.
"I answered that question once," she I
Bnapped.
"Well, answer it again. I want a direct

th'- contrary, the witness said, the wife
had Insisted on her remaining after she
had signified her intention of moving.
Amanda Kopp, recalled to the stand by
â Attorney >Ferral. testified that while her
f.ith'-r and mother were talking before
the shot was (ir-d Kopp had a plug of
tobacco and a knife in his hands. The
evident drift of this question and answor
was to lay a basis for a plea of self-de
fense if the case ever comes to trial. An
tlcipatJng this, Coroner Hill remarked
thai it Â«a? strange that the girl should
have noticed these things and did not Bee

THOSE BROKEN STOVES.
A Protest Agairst Worthless Goods
Being Sent to Manila.
Manager Goodwin of th* 1 Manufacturers'
and Producers' Association has Mnt an
interesting letter to tho quartermaster
general of thp Onited States ;innv :it
Washington, f.-illins his attention to thf
recent shipment of worthless stoves from ,
the ICast to the army at Manila. It will
be remembered that 300 of these articles
came here from the East for shipment to
the Philippines, and when seen at the
wharf they were broken and unfit for I
anything but the srr.-ip pile. Captain !
Batchelder stated that he had no nu
thortty to condemn the Ftnff and they j
were sent on to Manila, notwithstanding ;
facilities for shirping provisions to the
soldiers were- at a premium. A short time
later another batch of 300 damaged stoves :
arrived. After setting forth these facts, ;
Mr. Goodwin says:
"We respectfully invite your attention j
THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, IRIDAY, JUNE 30, 1899.
to the facilities afforded right here in the
city of San Francisco for providing goods
of this character in as short if not shorter
time than from the East, as has been
demonstrated un numerous occasions, and
of a grade and quality ecjiml to tho^e se
cured in Eastern cities. The advantages
of local delivery especially in stoves,
should not he underestimated after the
experience derived from these two ship
ments, for with delivery here every stove
can be placed on transports in good con
dition, delivered and used by the army for
the purposes for which it w:is intended,
a result which hns not been acotnpllshed
in making shipments from the Bast.
"Another circumstance connected with
these Shipments that does not tend to les
sen the evil is the fact that tlje facilities
of the transport service i -i the Pacific
being limited and while all the energies
of tiie quartermasters department are
being directed toward providing transpor
tation for men and supplies destined for
the Philippines the use of twenty to twen
ty-fiv*Â» thousand cubic feet of space on
transports for the earring 1 of stoves
that are known before departure from
ibis port to be entirely useless for array
purposes would seem to be at least a fail
ure to provide for the best interests of the
service. \\v trust that the quartermas
ter's department is fully convinced of the
futility of these shipments from Kastern
points, and while we have no intention or
desire to place ourselves in a position
where it may be inferred that we pro
pose to dictate to the quartermaster's
department how it shall conduct its busi
ness, we do believe that you should know
that the above facts are well known here
and that their recurrence will not have
a tendency to elevate the morale or ef
ficiency of the service in the public mind."

been the custom to rangy the "drunks"

site each name- the order was written
"dismissed." The captain showed that
to dismiss them was wrong, as It looked
on the records as il" they were not guilty.

While laboring under the strange hal

20-year-old Bon of Samuel <?. Whitney, a
collector, last night blew out his brains
! with a SS-caliber- Smith & Wesson pistol,
I the property of his father. The deed was
committed at hia home 24t! Scott Btreet
Whitney was employed bb ni^ht porter \
of the Hotel St. Nicholas but was forced j
to resign his position about a month ago
lon account of ill health. Alter that ho
eerned to gro.w melancholy and frequent
ily hinted at suicide. Last evening he ate
a hearty supper and seemed to be in un
usually ;;",.<! spirits. Coins to his room,
h< dressed himself in his street attire and
Btarted to leave the hquse. His mother
hailed him and asked him where he was
going. He replied that he intended to
take a walk and would return in about
an hour. Ills mother, evidently suspect
ing something wrong, consented to ac
company him. While Mrs. Whitney was
preparing herself for the . contemplated
walk ih>- foolish boy returned to h:s pri
vate apartments and, standing before a
mirror, blew cut his brains. Coronfr Hill
w:is at once notified, but in deference to
the wishes of his distracted parents lie
did not remove the body to the Morgue.
Several days ago Wn-itney complained
of feeling 111 and asked his rather to take
a walk with him. During the short trip
he frequently complained thai everybody
they passed was looking at him.
â¢â '\Vi;y do they size me ui> In such a ;
determined fashion?" h^ asked his :
father. "Is it because I look so funny?" i
l'h.- anxious parent assured him that
he waa not a subject for ridicule, and j
spoke encouragingly of his appearance.
After returning to his home Whitney con
tinued to speak of the supposed annoy

MURDER THEORY IS
BEING STRENGTHENED
PROVING THAT MINNIE ADAMS
PURCHASED POISON.
Story Told by Officer Herlihy Corrob
orated by Oliver T. Cox, a
Geary-Street Car Con
ductor.
The prosecution in the Minnie Adams
case w.is greatly strengthened yesterday.
At the opening of the session OflU'er J. !
P. Herlihy took the stand and for some
hours underwent a severe cross-examina- j
tlon by Attorney Mack, who represents
the accused, but could not be shaken in
the general details ot his story. He was
positive that shortly before 9 o'clock on :
the evening 'preceding the baby Grays
death the accused purchased a bottle of j
carbolic acid in the drug store at the cor- \
n. r of Devisadero and Geary streets. I
After leaving the store, the officer tost I- ,
lied, she >iii wrapped a bottle, tore off a
label and throwing it <>n the Bidewalk
hurried out to catch a oar. The officer
said that he picked up the label, on which j
he saw words poison and carbolic add |
were printed, and took it into the dri'g
store.' He was a little uncertain as to I
the clothing she vni" on the occasion
and some differences between his testi
mony given at the present trial and the |
Police Court examination were brought
out by the defense, but they did not ma- I
terially affect the general story.
Oliver Thomas Cox was the next wit
in ss called, cox is a conductor on tht,
Geary street road, and corroborated Her
lihy in detail. He said that at iwo min
utes past 9 o'clock (>;i the evening pre
ceding the murder his ear arrived at De
vlsadero street. The gripman was .sig
naled to stop and a woman hoarded the I
car. The witness noticed nothing unus- |
ual about the appearance or manner of
the passenger until after the ear started, i
She then turned in her seat and closely:
observed Officer Herlihy., who was stand-,
ing near the drug store. The officer was '
a]Ho watching her, and the conductor said
that he thought the "woman was making
a mash on the policeman."
At Parker avenue, however, the woman
got off and proceeded north. I'pon the i
night In question the witness testified
tbat she wore a brown sailor hat anil a j
dark cape, with fur around the edges. !
lir did not particularly notice her dress.
Subsequently he was taken to the prison
and Identified Mrs. Adams as the woman
in question.
Some time was also spent in an effort
to break down Cox.'s story on cross-ex
amination, but with little success.
EVERYBODY MUST PAY.
Poll-Tax Will Be Raised to $3 After
This Week.
Assessor Dodge and his deputies ar>>
preparing a JlsagTeeable .surprise i, r
those who are delinquent in their poll
tax. i mly two days remain in which fi
can be paid for poll tax. On Monday it
will require S3 to satisfy the Assessor.
This i.s especially important ;o those who
own'l'cai estate and have not paid their
pull tax, for it becomes a lien on their
property. There arc several thousand
capitalists ;ind largo property owners who
have Â« vaiied payment of their poll tax
thus far, but as the Assessor is preparing
a complete roll of delinquents it will be
ent( rÂ«'<l against their real property in
(â¢very case. If the tax if not paid by the
end of the year it will be $4, together' with
the cost of collection.
chief Poll Tax Collector Firmin is of
the opinion that by this procedure all
thdse persons who have heretofore cs
raped payment of poll tax. although host
able to pay it. will find it impossible to
evade it this your. Many people who aM
out of town are remitting their poll tax
by mail. Chl.'f Firmin is getting $5 and
$Â« now from property owners who failed
to pay their poll tax last year.

Is Your Digestion Poor?
A Sample and Full Information Con-
cerning the New Discovery for
Dyspapsia Sent Free to
Any Address.
A great deal of interest lias been ex-
cited recently in the medical profes-
sion by the discovery of h new prepara-
tion, which has made many remark-
able cures in cases of dyspepsia and
indigestion.
This remedy is nut a secret patent
medicine, but is a scientific combina-
tion of pure pepsin and bismuth and
fruit salts, pleasant to the taste, in
tablet form, and sold by druggists un-
der the name of Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets. Dr. Erskine, who tested the
tablets in many cases with marked suc-
cess, states that they act directly en
the food taken into the stomach, di-
gesting it perfectly, no matter how-
weak the stomach may be; they have
no action on the bowels and do not
physic, being purely and simply a cure
for dyspepsia and nothing else.
All physicians recommend them as
being the safest, most sensible, most
effective stomach remedy on the mar-
ket.
Xn dieting or change of habits is re-
quired: eat all the wholesome food you
care for and take a tablet at each
meal, the food will be thoroughly di-
gested, the body nourished, the stomach
rested, that's the whole secret, of cur-
ing indigestion and the whole secret
of the success of Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets: the reason why they have
taken the place of after-dinner pills,
â stomach bitters," "laxatives" and
"tonics."
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are sold
by druggists at fit) cents per package,
or he will order them for you if you ask
him, as all druggists sell them.
A small sample package "f the tablets
will be sent tree to any address if you
will write to F. A. Stuart & Co., Mar-
shall, Mich. Also circulars and testi-
monials.
Catarrh of the Stomach,
A Pleasant, Simple, but Safe and Ef-
fective Remedy for It.
Catarrh of the stomach has long been
considered the next thing to incur-
able. The usual symptoms are a full
or bloating sensation after eating, ac-
companied sometimes with sour or
watery risings, a formation of gases,
causing pressure on the heart and
lungs and difficult breathing, head-
aches, fickle appetite, nervousness and
a general played-out, languid feeling.
There is often a foul taste in the
mouth, coated tongue, and if the In-
terior of the stomach could be seen it
would show a slimy, inflamed condi-
tion. *
The cure for this common and obsti-
nate trouble is found in a treatment
which causes the food to be readily,
thoroughly digested before it has time
to ferment and irritate the delicate
mucous surfaces of the stomach. To
secure a prompt and healthy digestion
is the one necessary thing to do, and
when normal digestion is secured the
catarrhal condition will have disap-
peared.
According t<> Dr. Harlands'm, the saf-
est and best treatment is to use after
each meal a tablet composed of dias-
tase, aseptic pepsin, a little nux, golden
seal and fruit acids. These tablets
can now be found at all drug stores un-
der the name of Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets, and, not being a patent medi-
cine, can be used with such perfect
safety and assurance that healthy ap-
petite and thorough digestion will fol-
low their regular use after meals.
Mr. J. N. Bocher of 2710 Dearborn
street. Chicago, writes: "Catarrh is a
local condition resulting . from a ne-
glected cold in the head, whereby the
lining membrane of the nose becomes
inflamed and the poisonous discharge
JURY CHARGES
DR. WACHEHDORF
WITH MURDER
John Kehlenbeck Died
of Poison.
MORPHINE IN HIS STOMACH
CHEMIST CRACKBON GIVES DAM-
AGING TESTIMONY.
Collapse of the Accused for Want of
Cocaine Occurs During the In
quest and the Drug Is Ad
ministered.
A Coroner's jury yesterday brought in
a verdict charging Dr. C. C. J. Wachen
dorf with the murder of John Kehlenbeck,
who died under suspicious circumstances'
lasi Tuesday night in a lodging house at
SISV& Jessie street The medical and chem
lc;ii testimony was to the effect that
death did not occur from disease or from
what arc called natural causes, and that
there was a sufficient quantity of unab
sorbed morphine In the d'^ad man's stom
ach to have caused death.
Chemist T-. S. Crackbon appeared before
the jury and told them that he had
found a large quantity of morphine in
Kehlehbeck's stomach. This was surplus,
or unabsorbad, and it was positive proof
that the poison in the system had caused
the death of Kehlenbeck and that the
drug had been administered through the
mouth. The chemist had not completed
the quantitative analysis and would not be
able to do so until this evening, so that
he was unable to state the quantity in the
stomach or whether any other poison had
been used.
Dr. Zabala's testimony corroborated the
poison theory. He had made an autopsy,
could llnd no cause for death in the con
dition of the organs and could ascribe
Kehlenbeck'g demise to poison only.
The other witnesses told nothing that
had not been published already. It was
proved that Wachemlorf had been admin
istering medicines, mostly poisons in allo
pathic doses, to the deceased.
While the Inquest was in progress Wa
chendorf, who occupied a seat in the roar
.if the room, collapsed. He was taken
into the private oflicÂ» of the Coroner.
where he fainted away, but was brought
back to consciousness by Deputy Coroaer

Wonderful Power of a New Medical â 
Discovery.
A remarkable preparation for the cure
of dyspepsia, indigestion and stomach
trouble â  -a very recently been made
known and will undoubtedly be of great
! benefit to nine-tenths of the American
. nation, who are notoriously a nation of
dyspeptics; everybody has more or less \
dyspepsia, it seems to be a fashionable ;
disease; at the same time, indigestion |
is by no means a trifling thing, but it j
is well known to all physicians that
consumption", kidney and heart troubles,
, headache and nearly all nervous weak- j
nesses ar<Â» the result, in the beginning j
lof imperfect digestion. Very few pc - 1
pie realize the importance of a healthy
digestion., as it is the mainspring of
happiness in this life. Th* person with
perfect digestion knows nothing of ncr- 1
vousness, sleeplessness, headaches and J
the many disagreeable symptoms of a
disordered stomach. This new remedy !
! is not a secret patent medicine, recom- |
j mended to cure everything under the
! sun, but is purely and simply a stom-
| ach remedy composed of vegetable ea- '
I sences, fruit salts, pure pepsin, bis- t
! muth and golden seal. These valuable
1 remedies are combined in the form of
pleasant tasting tablets and now sold :
by druggists everywhere, under the
name of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets. A I
| scientific experiment made with these :
1 tablets proved that one grain of the di- j
gestive principle would digest 3ooo times j
I its own weight of eggs, meat or similar
wholesome food. The whole trouble I
with dyspeptics is the fact their stom- j
achs are too weak to digest the food
eaten; these tablets digest the food,
I rest the stomach, nourish the body and
I thus give the stomach time to recover
its natural condition, when they are no
longer required. Dr. Showorth, in his
c xperiments, also reports a marked in-
j crease in flesh when Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets were used, which is not sur-
prising when it is remembered that
most people are thin because of poor
digestion; from all accounts it would
appear that Stuart's Dyspepsia Tab-
j lets are a safe, reliable remedy for any
form of stomach weakness and the best
that has so far been discovered.
All druggists sell Stuart's Dyspep-
sia Tablets at 50 cents per package.
Gratifying Results.
Interesting Experiments With the
Ne^ Stomach Remedy â Not a
Patent Medicine, but a
Safe Cure for All
Forms of Indi-
gestion.
The results of recent investigation
have established beyond question the
great value of the new preparation for
indigestion and stomach troubles. It
is composed of the digestive acidsâ pep-
sin, bismuth, golden seal and similar
stomachicsâ prepared in the form of
twenty-grain lozenges, pleasant to the
taste, convenient to carry them travel-
ing, harmless to the most delicate
stomach, and probably the safest, most
effectual cure yet discovered for mdl
I pan, unknown to Wachendorf, substituted
' water for the drug. Wachendorf said he
felt relieved, but the .faith cure did not
last for more than four minutes, at the
end of which time the man's teeth were
chattering and !he . pleaded for another
dose of the drug. . Another grain of co
caine was given him with a quieting ef
fect.
i Me is a slave to the use of cocaine and
morphine and there was no doubt 'in the
minds of the jurors that the use of the
drug has undermined his moral nature.
After approving the verdict Coroner
Hill issued a warrant to hold Wachendorf
i on the charge of murder. In the afternoon
Detective Sllvey took Wachendorf to the
Receiving Hospital for another injection

HEART DISEASE.
SOME FACTS REGARDING THE
RAPID INCREASE OF
HEART TROUBLES.
Do Not Be Alarmed, but Look for
the Cause.
Heart troubles, at least among Amer-
icans, are certainly increasing, and
while this may be largely due to the
excitement and worry of American
business life, it is more often the re-
sult of weak stomachs, of poor diges-
tion.
Real, organic heart disease is incur-
able, but not one case in a hundred of
heart trouble is organic.
The tiose relation between heart
trouble and poor digestion is because
both organs are controlled by branches
of the same great nerves, the Sympa-
! thetic and Pneumogastric.
In another way also the heart is af-
fected by that form of poor digestion
which causes gas and fermentation
! from half-digested food: there is a
| feeling of oppression and heaviness in
the chest, caused by pressure of the
distended stomach on the heart and
lungs, interfering with their action;
hence arise palpitation and short
breath.
Poor digestion also poisons the blood,
makes it thin and watery, which irri-
tates and weakens the heart.
The most sensible treatment for heart
trouble is to improve the digestion and
to insure the prompt assimilation of
food.
This can best be done by the regular
use after meals of some safe, pleasant
[ and ' effective digestive preparation,
like Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, which
may be found at most drugstores, and
: which contain valuable, harmless di-
gestive elements in a pleasant, conve-
nient form.
It is safe to say that the regular, per-
j sistent use of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tab-
| lets at meal time will cure any form
i of stomach trouble except cancer of the
I stomach.

stories were circulated about him. His

Magee block on Fourth street, and the

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. June 2i>.â Weakness characterized
the opening in wheat. Weather was favorable
for the harvesting of winter wheat and the
growth of spring. Liverpool cables .'were some
what disappointing, showing Blight declines In
some futures, and Northwest receipts, though
showing some falling off, were still too heavy
to permit of any bullishness from that source.
Th( re was fn addition an inclination to even
up on trades over the holidays, and these fac
tors ruled the market for the first half hour.
September opened at 74' 4 c, compared with yes
terday's closing priÂ«-e of T4' L ..-. It soon 'de
clined to 74 He, then gradually turned strong,
and though many minor fluctuations occurrel
th.- tendency In the main was toward higher
prices until lute in the afternoon. Reports
from the Northwest were far from satisfactory
concerning growing wheat. Many complaints
of damage, were received, principally from rust,
while from the winter wheat country reports
of Uarvsting operations were disappointing in
some cases. The Northwest markets showed
strength even when this market was declining,
and as this was regarded as evidence of thÂ«
truth of the damage reports, it a d a strength
ening effect on the local market. Russian news
became somewhat of a factor again. Private
advices from Russia declared that country
would not produce over half a crop, and a no
ticeable increase In the buying occurred when
this became known. Shortly after noon the
market turned weak. September declined to
7l' X c and closed at that price.
Corn was dull and heavy. Th" market was
Influenced by favorable weather and continued
large receipts by the continuous July liquida
tion. September closed lie to %c lower.
oats were quiet and easy, the weakness be
ing more marked In July than In September.
September closed, a shad" lower.
Provisions wore quiet and heavy, with more
pressure "ii July products that on the most dis
tant futures. The packer* were the best sell
ers, probably with a view of widening the
carrying charges. Weakness of corn and lower
ling i rices Influenced the market In a degree.

BOSTON ' WOOL MARKET.
â  BOSTON. June 29.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow: The wool
I market has continued active and strong. Dur
ing the past week prices have reached the
I highest figures seen in m ire than a year r.nd
the tendency is at this writing unmistakably
upward. Manufacturers, traders and simu
lators have been operating quite freely, both
the large and small mills â  Ing represented in
the market, and all have apparently come to
the conclusion that it Is no use to stand out ;
longer against the Inevitable rise in wool.
Prices exceeding 50c clean for fine Territory
: wools have been freely paid, choice selected
staple commanding a.Â» much as 53Q<54c Some
large Hi 1 8 of wool have been taken at current
j quotations.
The strength and buoyancy shown by the
market were accentuated by the reports re
ceived from the London wool sales, which '
opened on Tuesday with a good attendance
and offering of 234.000 baler. The continued
strength and Increased activity shown in the
goods market has naturally exerted a strength
ening Influence.
Sales of the week at Boston amounted to
5,408,800 pounds of domestic and 705,000 foreign,
making a total of 6.113,800, against a total' of
j 6,054.400 for the previous week, and a total
I of 1,261.500 for the corresponding week last
] year.' Sales since January 1. 1899. amount to

Some Significant Facts Shown by an
Examination of the Accounts
of the Several Depart
merits.
OAKLAND. June 20.â At nearly every |
meeting of the Board of Works and the j
City Council one, two or more hills are i
ordered paid for gas, water or electricity!
for some branch of lie city government. '
These Mils -ire all paid out of various
funds, there being no such .thing as 9
water fund or a lighting: fund, although
there is a street lighting fund.
Occasionally !r. < â¢. I 111?. such as bill* for
street sprinkling or hydrants, attract gen- [
eral attention. At this time especially is J
this the case, when the t.'ity Council has \
undertaken to examine into the possibility |
of lining a water supply for Oakland.
Little attention. however, la ever given
to the multiplicity of water and pas bills
paid by the â â  ty for the numerous Institu- i
tions which it maintains. These bill-; in j
the ;if::; â  â¢ â ;â  form an immense item of
expenditure, though few people ever Riv:,
a thought to their existence, owing to
their b^ins hidden away in the various ;
funds.
With the asslstnnee of City Auditor
Breed The ( all has pone through every
fund in tl â¢ city government showing th<
detailed expendituri or gas and water
fi r the fiscal year riding to morrow. Tho
figures an â  I m â¢â â  than general interest.
They are as follows:
Water General fund. $13.04190; Police

June, $169 61. Total. $2015 19.
Electricity General fund, $347 60; other
funds, $73,586 43 Total, $73.935 03.
Owing to the deficit in the fiscal year
the ii;is Company deducted fivrivi from its
bills, and tins generosity has received the
warm commendation of tin- whole city.
It Is Included in the list because it logit'i
matelj belongs to the cost of street light
ing. With the exception of electricity all
the other amounts are for eleven months
of the fiscal year that closes to-morrow.
One-eleventh of the gross total has there.

derstanding and should be compelled to
give them up. I shall see Chief Lees on
the matter."

of this city. Over the casket had been
draped in graceful folds the beautiful silk
Amprinn flag of the parlor at the ex- |
-cd. who shortly
passed awa y said :
"I have loved t h. .-tars and strips iill
my life, and 1 want my girls of the parlor
to promise that it shall cover my cask-.-t ;
when I am placed in it."
At the head of the casket was a large !
n.ir. contributed by th. pari'-r to which
Mrs. ('urlk- belonged, and by its Bide was
an American flag in flowers on a staff
i In a bed of white roses, on which :
was the sentiment, "Loyal to the end." ;

.' -â  ed to be present at the services.
The members nf La Estrella Parlor, each
wearing a crape-covered badge, w<-r'?
ranged around the i;iskit. and at tru; ap i
d hour Past Grand President Miss
Marian Bertola delivered an eloquent ,
eulogy on the 1 i f Â»- work of Mrs. Carlie, !
of Ji'-r love fnr the order, which ,
had ti> â  n accentuated by the love which '
her brother, who was one of the early of
ficers of the Native Sons, had for that j
organization, dwelt upon her patriotism ,
und love of country ami State and of her
affection for her only son, who is left
alone in this great city. .The members of
the order who were present then sang the
Initiation ode which Mrs. Carlie had writ
ten and which she had desired sung- over
her l"fly aftt-r her death.
The funeral service of the order was
then read by Miss Bertola, after which
thÂ« Knickerbocker Male Quartet sang an
appropriate selection, which was followed

After the casket had been lowered into
the. grave Miss Bertola read a part of the
burial service, after which Miss McCar
thy offered a prayer and Miss Witten
meyer spoke the closing words of farewell
to one whom every member of the order
loved. As the last words of praise fell
from her lips she dropped upon the casket

golden poppy, her example being followed
by others standing around the grave,
members of the order singing "Abide

CABIN AND PARLOR.
Proposition That Native Sons of Ore
gon and California Meet Near
the State Line.
During the recent session of the Grand
Parlor of the Native Sons of the Golden
West Grand Secretary Lunstedt was In
structed to send a telegram of greeting
to the Grand Cabin of the Native Sons of
Oregon. A few days since there was re
ceived from Eugene D. White, grand sec
retary of the Oregonians' organization,
which is but of recent origin, but already
has eighteen subordinate cabins, a letter
of acknowledgment in which the writer
suggests a joint meeting of the Native
Sons of the two States. He writes:
Your kin.l and cordial message directed to
me as grand secretary of the Native Sons (if
Oregon, expressing in behalf of the Native Sons
of the Golden West the fraternal greetings and
good wishes of that body for and toward the
Native Sons of Oregon, was promptly received
and as promptly read in open Grand Cabin.
The ovation that the dispatch received from
thÂ« members of the Grand Cabin would be a
caution to co, ins. It was received with the
wildest enthusiasm, and I as the grand secre
tary was authorized to acknowledge the re
ceipt and to say that the Native Sons of Ore
gon, through Its grand officers, are thoroughly
In sympathy and harmony with the Native Sons
of the Golden West and are its friends, first,
last and all the time. It Is fervently hoped
that at, pome time In the near future we cap
get together and Indulge in a feast of reason
and flow of soul.
What Is the matter with meeting in the early
' part of 19M near the California line, both grand
I bodies belnÂ£ fully represented, and having such
: a love feast as royalty knows how to have and
enjoy? This Is one of the many peculiar Ideas
I am possessed of periodically. 'Spose you
and others work this thing up. I am In for it.

TO EXTEND THE BOULEVARD.
Supervisors Are Preparing the Way
Through the Almshouse Tract.
The City and County Surveyor had one
I of his deputies out on th*> Alms-house
tract yesterday maklnp surveys and ad
fustlng levels f<>r a continuation of Dewey
boulevard north w.'ird.
The boulevard, which was pushed
through the Sutro property two years ago
from the hind adjoining the Almshouse
tract to the Cerbett road, stopped there
for the time being. It *-as the intention
of the then Supervisors to tack on to the
north section that portion running
through the Almshouse land, but it was
not dune then and no action has been since
taken until the present Supervisors gave
instructions to the Surveyor to prepare
plans for the running of the boulevard
i through the oit\'s property. At the samÂ»
: time it is said the Spring Valley Water
I Company anr ) t he owners of the "Harmon
! property. which extends from Lake
Honda to L street, will prosecute the
| work on that section.
When this work is completed Dewey
boulevard will form one of the best drive
ways on this side of the bay, extending
i from Golden Gate Park to Ocean avenue.
; with the prospects of an additional link
throueh the park to the Presidio by the
proposed extension of the panhandle
j along Fourteenth avenue through Rich
mond.

was th>> most successful ever made by
that vessel during her eventful career.
She made good time both ways and came
from Nagasaki via Yokohama in twenty
six days to this port. The officers and
men were so pleased with the vessel that
not a single man has left her and all will
go out on her again next week. In this
respect the Cleveland has broken the rec
ord, as she is the only transport that has
returned to San Francisco without some
one having "a kick to register."
The officers of the Cleveland are: C. F.
Klitgard, captain; R. Peterson, chief of
ftcer; J. \V. Dill, chief engineer; Thomas
Blackburn, first assistant engineer; and J.
M. Simpson, purser. Along the front they
are known as "the happy family," and

RAABE EXONERATED
BY THE COMMITTEE
NO EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM TO
PROVE EXTORTION.
Blanchard's Testimony Was Weak
and Made Little Impression on
the Investigators.
The investigating committee of seven,
chosen from the Fourth of July commit
tee to examine Into the charges preferred
against Fred Raabe by James M. Blnnch
ard, met at 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon
and after listening to the testimony of
Blanchard decided to report findings
which will exonerate Raabe on the
charges of attempted extortion. â 
Blanchard told how he had approached
Raabe on the 14th of June with an offer
of $20 to secure the right of line in thÂ»)
procession. He said it was an understood
proposition that Raabe was to receive the
money, though no time was placed upon
its payment; neither was there nn as
sent on Raabe's part that he would ac
cept it. Blanchard also said that the Mu
sicians' I'nion wanted to discover some
thing against Raabe. and this, along with
an idea to assist the Fourth of July com
mittee to clean out corruption from its
ranks, induced him to offer the $20 "bait."
Blanchard seemed very anxious to se
cure the right of line, and In order to
make assurance doubly sure he impor
tuned "Jim" O'Brien and Chairman
Fletcher to put in a word or two for him
From Fletcher's statement, Blanchard
had offered to spend $20 to get his band
in front of the line. Fletcher told him
then with a proper indignation tfiat he
had better not offer him $20. To this
Blanchard demurred, saying that he
could not remember aYi incident In which
he had made such a proposition.
The committee then debated upon the
point whether there was any evidence of
extortion. The general opinion was to
dismiss the charges without examining
Raabe. This idea was adopted and Raabe
was called in and notified of the decision.
Mr. Ranbe has decided to bring the mat
ter up before the Musicians 1 Union.
Chairman Fletcher has appointed Z. U.
Dodge chairman of the fireworks commit
tee in place of the deposed Colonel Rob
inson.
On account of the celebration the South
ern Pacific offices will be closed Saturday
afternoon, Sunday, Monday and Tuesday.
SHIPPERS CINCHED.
The Railroad Agents Have Decided to
Pay No Telegraphic Charges
After July 1.
For some time past it has been the cus
tom for the shippers of this city when
ordering goods from the East to take ad
vantage of the privilege offered them by
the roads during their hauling to send
their telegraphic orders over the line,
making them chargeable to the company
patronized.
Tht different roads have heretofore con-
Bented .tv this practice as a matter of
business courtesy, but the matter having
grown from a. trivial to a considerable ex
p. use, for which there is no compensa
tion, they have decided to do away with
it. At the meeting of the local Passenger
Agents' Association held on the 23d inst.
a resolution was passed which provides
that for the thirty days following July 1
no agent will pay telegraphic tolls in
curred by a shipper.
This resolution Is intended merely as a
feeler. The different agents have agreed
to obserw its tiTms during the time men
tioned, and then, if it is seen to work
well, the new rule will be continued in
definitely.
MISS HAAG OBJECTS.
Demands Removal of the Executor of
Her Mother's Will.
It is expected that there will be con-
fslderablt? difficulty in. the administration
of the estate of the late Mrs. Catherine
Haag, who k*-pt a saloon on Dupoiit
street, before her property is finally dis
tributed to her daughter, Emma Haag,
the sole devisee.
Mrs. Haag named Jacob Rnmctsph,
keeper of a saloon at '2"~ Grant avenue,
as executor of her estate. A few days
apo Miss Haag's attorney secured an or
der from Judge Coffey t'> prevent tha
executor from drawing money belonging
to the estate from the hank. It being
claimed that he had already drawn $s(iii
without reason. Fn connection with tho
iT'ier Miss Haap tiled a protest against
Rumetsch'a appointment on the ground
that he was "the keeper of a dive which
was the resort of low and vicious per
sons."
An answer was filed yesterday hy Rum
etsch, in which he enters a general denial
to Miss Haag's allegations, and on these
pleadings an Investigation will be made.

TAX RATE OF $ 1.073 IS FIXED.
"iâ¢"\ll V. Finance Committee of the
' Board of Supervisor:-, has fixed for j
| ti-p nsoal year which v. ill com- }
X rrfeiu-e to-morrow a tax levy of
?Mi73 on every $!00 on an as- ;
Fessed valuation of 5.^0,000.000. The i
recommendation of the committee â  ill j
undoubtedly be accepted by thÂ« board, j
which has pledged itself to the dollar j
limit. The <ity is thus insured one of j
the mo.st economical administrations In >
the history of the municipality. The \
tax levy as it has been prepared by the j
Finance Committee is published in full j
this morning and constitutes news of j
paramount importance to taxpayers.
The Finance Committee has used Its j
knife of economy â  sparingly upon the !
tax-eating departments of the city.
Useless expenditures, which have been
proposed, have been denied- Extrava
gance in many public oflices has been
stopped. Sinecures have been de- !
st roved and a 'financial administration!
modeled upon fair business methods j
and principles has been established, j
Contemplated improvements â¢if a ]â â¢ r- !
nianent character ha iâ¢â  been delayed J
because ot the approaching regime' of
the 'bonding stem. Politicians for
nn'-e have been sacrificed to the pubile |
welfare and thr- taxpayer, for the first
has !" on gi\ en an
â 
Th-> T'innno- Committee in fixing the
rate at SHOTS asks a total revenue
which is fl-.11ti.9T7 ":'â¢ less than it was tor |
thf tiP'i'i year which . -mi- to-day. This j
will givr- y â ;.â¢;!â¢â  idea of the sweeping j
i-'conoir.y which has been observed. It |
is m<st unusual for a great municipal- j
Sty to reduce its animal revenue over
eleven hundred thousand dollars in a j
slnglv year, but this is what the Fin- j
;,nce Committee of \h<* Hoard of Super- |
vtÂ»>ors has done. Th.- amount of money .
appropriated for tho fiscal year which |
!p just ending was $i;. Â«>.\:>. ."..'..". 03. The
amount which musi sutlico for the. com
ing fiscal year is *+.5?35.575.
Auditor Wells estimated that the lo
cal government could be run economic
ally for 55,4Â«8.1 ?2. the sum of S-J.507.195 I
j.. i>e used during the six months which j
will ensue under the consolidation act
and the sum .>f $2,660,947 for the first six j
months under the charter 'I his total |
was &57.413.03 !â¢ ss than was provided
for tiie fiscal yeai just ending. But the
Finance Committee was not satisfied j
with the Auditor's estimates, which, de- j
ducting 51.405.142 to be raised rom j
sources other than taxation, would \
make a tax rate of $] 10 on every $100 !
on an assessed valuation of $350,000,000. j
The Finance Committee believed that !
it could do better than this and the
pruning knife began to work upon the ,
Auditor's estimates. The result is now <
what the Finance Committee recom- 1
men. ls. The Auditor's estimate is cut
from 168,142 to $4,938,578. a decrease of
55-9, f>G4, and a total decrease from the
appropriation for the closing year of
$11116,977.03. Of the $4,935,57S required
by the Finance Committee to conduct I
The local government 51.435.578 will be
raist d from sources other than taxa
tion, leaving J3.500.000 to be raised in
taxes at Jl on every $100 on an assessed
valuation of $350,000,000. Tht? total tax
ation of ?4. :â¢.>.:.â . S is divided into the
sum of $2,506,539 for the six months re- ;
maining under lh.> consolidation act.
and $2,432,039 for the first six months
under the charter.
In tfiis way the Supervisors honor
their pledge to a dollar limit on an as
sessed valuation of $350,000,000. But the
board is also pledged to provide a de- '
licit of Sl.iu.OOO and an appropriation of j
$125,000 for St. Mary's Park. This j
makes a total of $255,000. which will re- ',
quire an additional tax of 7.3 cent;:,
making the total rate $1,073. â¢
In making the enormous reduction
required by their pledge the Finance
Committee have entered with economi
cal purpose into every municipal de
partment. The strictest economy will
be a necessity if both ends are to meet
during the coming fiscal year. The ad
vertising bills have been heavily cut. !
The Assessor is given $35,000 instead of
$80,000 for extra clerks. The fund for
the preparation of the: assessment roll
in the Auditor's â  office ha been di
minished. The contingent expenses of
the City and County Attorney have
been withheld. The Coroner feels the
knife on some of his perquisites. The
exempt firemen's relief fund, which
was enriched this year by 12,000, finds
r.o provision whatever.

Finance Committee appropriated $1,
--200,000 fiat. Something in the nature
I of an ax fell upon the Street Depart

hearts of the politicians glad with $525,
--000. The Auditor decided that for the
I year beginning to-morrow $425,120 will

of the Board of Supervisors says that
the Street Department must get along

In the sir.jde item of street llphting
alone a saving of $^0,000 is made, the
appropriation b'inp: reduced from $350,

instead of $40,000, is made for sinking

Finance Committee accomplishes its
remarkable reduction of eleven hun

In the taMe which follows there are
three main departments. That on the

each office was for the fiscal year Just

Auditor's estimate for the coming fiscal
year, which would give a tax rate of

ommendations of the Finance Commit
te< , which gives a tax rate of $1 on
every $100 on an assessed valuation of
(350,000,000 after th.- revenues derived
from sources other than taxation have
been deducted.
As a matter of interesting compari
son it may be stated that the tax rate
for the fiscal year just closinp was $1,318
on every $100 on an assessed valuation
of $350,000,000.

IMPROVEMENTS MUST WAIT
AT LEAST ANOTHER YEAR
IN considering the tax levy thÂ» Supervisors were confronted with a num
ber of petitions for special improvements presented by people in the
various districts it was hoped would be benefited. They were so nu
merous and the total so large that it was seen at. onre it would be Im
possible to grant them all. and no fair way of choosing: the most de
serving could be decided upon. It was finally settled by including but one of
the appropriations asked for â the one for the creation of St. Mary's park.
It was the largest of all. Among the improvements petitioned for were the
following:
Culvert across Sunnyside avenue at crossing of Foerster street
Extension of Berkshire street to Glenn avenue
Constructing main Intercepting sewer in Sunset district, from 11
Btreet to Fourteenth avenue, to 1 street and Twenty-fifth ave

TRUST TO CONTROL
CALIFORNIA'S WINES
Combination of Dry Wine Makers
Cannot Be Reorganized.
Large Producers, Backed by Ample Capital, Are to
Organize to Protect the Industry From the
Ruinous Low Prices of Former Years
THE big combination of winemakerg ,
known as the California Wlnemak
trs 1 corporation, which has been in
existence for the past five years |
and which embraced about <â¢> l' r;
cent of the dry wine producers of the
* State, will soon go out of business â¢ *"Â»* ;
' is the conclusion of those best qualified to â 
â  size up the situation.
The contracts with the corporation now
I in force will expire this fall and great ef
i forts have been mnde to induce the pro- ,
I ducers to sign again for ar.otb.-r Jive-year â 
i term. To this end delegates from the sev
eral wine districts met about two weeKs
i ago, and after three meetings submitted
1 to the corporation a form of contract to
! be tendered the wine-makers for their ai -
; ceptance or rejection. Those who are the
! most deeply interested in the weltare ol
the combine were very much In dcubt as
to the fate of the proposed agreement, ana
! It transpires that their fears were well
! founded.
The producers of Sonoma County were
' the first to rebel and demand the disso
lution of the compact, and that the affairs
of the corporation bo closed up In a man-:
ncr best calculated to serve the interests
of the members. However, their protests
were ignored and the contracts were sub- ,
muted to the wlhemakers of the various
districts a few days ago.
The Santa Clara County producers were
the first to pass Judgment upon the ton- i
tract, and they almost unanimously re
d it on the ground that they could
do better by staying out of any such ,
K-m-ral combination, this year at least.
At a meeting held in St. Helena last
Wednesday the producers of that section
took similar action, and with their decis
i< n the doom of the California \\ memak-
Corporation was sealed. Other sec
tions may take a different view of the
situation, but this -will have no effect,
upon the result, as the combination re
quires 55 per cent of all the dry wine
makers of the State, and with these three
counties holding out. it is an impossibil- j
ity to control the output.
dissatisfaction of the producers |
dates back several years, and as they:
could not see how the evils were to be
remedied they preferred at this time to 1
remain independent. In the parly part, of
its career the corporal ion got into litiga
tion Involving ovi r $100,000, and this with -
other expenses was very trying on the
exchequer. When the compact was
! formed the price of common sound wine
was i and 5 cents per gallon. The com- i
1 pact raised it to 12M> cents the first year, |
and In the se.-ond prices were forced up
to 15 cents. The magnitude of the litiga
tion that came in the third year knocked
DENNIS O'SULLIVAN
IN "SHAMUS O'BRIEN."
THAT Denis O'Sullivan has not yet
lop- his grip on the theater-poing j
public of San Francisco was amply (
demonstrated at the Tivoli Opera
h iuse last nfg*ht. when thts popular
place of amusement was crowded to the
doors with as cultured and fashionable
an audience as any management could |
expect to see assembled. Of course.
"Shamus O'Brien" is not a stranger to
San Fran' isco, and to say that it did not |
lose a particle of its typical charm and
characteristic melody in last night's ex
emplary presentation at the Tivoli ppera- (
house is but bestowing upon the produc- I
tion that credit which is by right its due. |
Particularly remarkable was the aston- i
ishing improvement of the Tivoli chorus. I
which, instead of its former lethargy, lias
suddenly acquired a vim and dash that
was so much more agreeable to observe
as it was expected. Max Hirsehfeld
seems to have discovered a sort of life
spring from which he gave the chorus to
drink. Be that as it may. the chorus did j
magnificent work last night.
It was easy enough to select tho star of I
the evening from the thunderous applause
that greeted his entrance. A majestic
stage presence does this O'Sullivan pos- j
sess, Â«nd it is surely not to be wondered '
hi that he is the center of admiration of
the fair sex. He fs cut out for the pare
of Shamus. His voice, although not par- j
ticularly robust, contains that agreeable!
flexibility so pleasant In essaying the part !
of a rustic hero. His histrionic accom
plishments are simply superb, and what
by some may be regarded as exaggera
tion Is In reality the intensity ot the
character an<l the dramatic situation of
the story, which needs must be executed
with vigor and emphatic declamation.
This idea! bit of acting deserved there- |
fore the four curtain calls and the beau- :
tiful laurel wreath which was presented
to the fortunate actor-vocalist after the!
first a<i Mr. O'Sullivan certainly dupli- ,
cated his success of last year.
Another new star, as it were, was Rhys ;
Thomas, who appeared in the part of i
Captain Trevor. Mr. Thomas succeeded
in presenting the dramatic execution of
this role with the necessary activity, and
while his higher nctes exhibited a cer
tain staleness not at all agreeable to the
musi.-al car. his middle register was suf
ficiently good to make one forget all |

the producers insisted thai they would

most nothing, and ii the bitt r contest

Hi' 1596 and this is said to be the prii i-k
pal cause for their refusal to sign ' " ,
other five years' contract. Their theotr
ying . ut of the compact is that by

Clara County (t is proposed if necessary
to distil enough wine to do away with
a surplus; but as the demand is good and
the coming vintage will be short there
is little prospei I that distillation will be
necessary to regulate values.
The ether side of the wine situation Is
different. The majority of the large pro
ducers and controllers, foreseeing thÂ«
present crisis, have decided to maintain
an organization which will be strong
enough to kct p prices from dropping
low a certain figure and there is no doubt
that they will be able 10 do so. However,
the new combine will not be a plain as
sociation of growers, but is to be a trusi,
th( business of which will be to control
the wine product <>f the State. The or
ganization will comprise the biggest men
in the business and by reason of th< i
combined assets they will be able to pro
< ure all (he money required to handle tc
vast enterprise successfully.
The prime object of the proposed trusi
is to insure a uniformity of vaiues and '.o
.i they do not drop below a. certain
and the idea at present is to fix
this at 12V. cents. The plan is entirely
feastible for the reason that th*> largest
producers will be incorporated in th^

the industry stated that the failure of the
corporation would insure the establish

about these higher passages. He, too, was
frequently and heartily applauded.
But next to Mr. O'Sullivan Annie Licn
ter is entitled to the lion's share of the
evening's sueess. Her voice seemed even
fresher than usual, and as she sajip she
spoke her lines with a certain abandon
and Intensity of feeling that created a
sympathy in the hearts of her auditors.
There is a j:rÂ«-at deal in realism, and the
beauty about Miss I,iehter's work is that
she plays ncr role without affectation ana
a certain nonchalance that makes it
;i pleasure to follow her. Both from a
musical as well as histrionic standpoint
Miss Llchter's impersonation of Nora wad
an artistic bit of work.
The balance of the cast contributed it^
share toward making' this presentation
a model one. Especially to be commended
is the stage management, which paid par
ticular attention to the smallest details.
All these things combined created a foil
ing of satisfaction among the large audi
. nee present that will no doubt prove of
considerable benefit to the treasury of tho
Tivoli ere this week has come to a close.
While the action of thp play is cleverly
thought out and artistically presented, tnn
composer seems to have missed his op
portunity to make a name for himself.
While the drama itself contains some, Una
climaxes, the music does not at all ri?Â«
above a tame orchestration, and reminds
one much of an organ arrangement. Thero
is altogether too much work for tho reeds
and not sufficient for the brass. It is,
therefore, not surprising that there is
hardly one among a hundred who can tell
you the name of the composer of "Shamus*
O'Brien." Nevertheless, it is a merito
rious piece of work, and some of th
choruses and duets rise at times above
the ordinary character of ihe music
