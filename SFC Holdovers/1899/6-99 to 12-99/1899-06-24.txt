PARTS, June 23. One deduction
will surely be drawn by all who
consider attentively the consti
tution of the new Cabinet. This
is that the republic has been
really menaced. By whom is a point on
which much discussion is possible. On
ihe nne hand the Socialists claim the
menace has been from Caesarism, as
personified In the army chiefs. On the
other hand, the National declare it
is from foreign interference, brought
about by the 'demoralization of. the
Army, w â â¢'! is the aim of the fc-'ooiJil-

The radical Socialists have decided
to support the Government provided it I

cision was made known, M. Charles

a few others, withdrew from the group.
The Temps says: "The composition '
of the Cabinet may appear extraor- j

tranquillity does not prevail In the same
degree. The Cabinet will shortly pro

Having suspended the writ of

is, perhaps, not surprising thai the
men in authority under martial
law in Idaho should forego the
formality of a warrant in arrest
ing men whom it is deemed de
sirable to silence or put out of

of the citizen, clearly, is not of
particular consideration. If he j

WALLACE, Idaho. Juno 23.â
Sensational scenes were en

his motion to set aside the In
dictments against the miners, severely
criticized the action of Coroner France
in summoning grand jurors whom he
knew to be biased, and who had pub
licly expressed opinions as to the de
fendants* guilt.
In support of the motion the affi
davits of the defendants were filed, in
each of which it is alleged that France
is a. bitter enemy of the accused; that
he is an employe of the Bunker Hill
Company; that he refused the defen
dants the right of counsel until they
were brought into court: that ho had

as he desired, and thnt ho packed the

IN AN OLD SCANDAL
SAN JOSE PEOPLE
WILL INVESTIGATE
McNaughton Said When Elected
That Stories Detrimental to
Him Would Be Sprung.
SAX JOSE, June ~">. âA thorough investigation of the charges made
against Professor James McNaughton, the new principal of the
Normal School, was commenced t<?-day by citizens. Prominent
men at Council Bluffs. la., have been communicated with, and as
Boon as they have been heard from a meeting will be called to
consider the matter. The Normal School has been an important factor in
San Jose's business life, as out of fiOO pupils enrolled 400 come fro-m other
parts of the State. These dispense considerable money for board and sup
plies, and the merchants realize that if the reputation of tho school be
hurt they would lose from $500 to $l(V)fl per month. The Trustees who
elected McNaughton are being openly condemned by the people, as is
Governor Gage, who is said to have Mood in with the plan to turn tho
school over to the politicians. Trustee Leavitt of Oakland was the leader
In the McNaughton boom. Trustees Short of Fresno and Brown and
Swelgert of this city also voted for the Arizona professor.
McNaughton is unknown here and was only in the city for a few
h'rurs on the day of his election. At that time he told several persons
stories detrimental to his character would be heard, but if he was given
a chance he would be able to clear them up.
Dr. H. C. Brown, chairman of thr- Normal School Trustees, says no
charges have been tiled against McNaughton and no attention will be
paid to reports unless charges are preferred.
John G. Jury and A. H. Suzzalo, the committee appointed to look into
McNaughton's character, will meet to-morrow morning and start in on
their work. Reports will he asked from lowa and Arizona. They will be
aided in the work by the entire alumni, and it will bo rushed along so
the result can be laid before the trustees at the meeting on July 10.

"The Orange Government is urging
the Transvaal to make further conces

Alfred Milner's franchise proposals are
useless without the granting of twelve
seats in the mining centers and the
right to speak English in the Volks

concisions, the Johannesburgers say
they prefer a treaty providing' security

OMAHA, Neb., June 23.â
The ex-members of the
Board of Education of
Council Bluffs, Iowa, readily re-
call the fight about ten years ago
which resulted in the resignation
of James McNaughton as super-
intendent of the public schools.
They say he. had held the posi-
tion over five years, and that
prior to the time when a fight
was made upon him he was a
very successful instructor and
gave general satisfaction. The
reason for Dr. McNaughton's
resignation in 1890 was. given
this evening by Finley Burke, a
prominent citizen.
"In those days," Mr. Burke
said, ""the School Board was in
a constant wrangle, not only over
the s'uperintendency, but over
the treasurership. This fight was
invariably fostered by the banks,
which wanted to control the de-
posits of the school fund, and in
order to win one faction or the
other would bring the superin-
tendency into the fight, if by so
doing they could gain a point.
McNaughton was not the only
superintendent of schools to get
caught in this snare. For a term
of years the fight seemed to be
incessant; McNaughton was not
the bone of contention, lie was
rather the victim of the local jeal-
ousies incident to getting pos-
session of the school money. The
law. in recent years, has prevent-
ed such disgraceful proceedings,
which did needless injury to
good men other than McNaugh-
ton. My recollection is that
there was nothing in the charges
filed against him that reflected
upon his personal character, and
I never had personal knowledge
of any wrong-doing on Mc-
Naughton's part."
Your correspondent made in-
quiry of other citizens, who told
him that formal charges. of a seri-
ous nature were filed against Mc-
Naughton before the Board of
Education seriously reflecting
upon his personal character,, but
it -was too late to get at these
records.
Still other \'Â°a\ were inter-
viewed, and for' the most part
they had a good word to say for
McNaughton and he apparently
stands well in the community, re-
gardless of the specific charges
made against him.
Mr. Jenkins said: "It is an
outrage that this man should be
pursued in this way for ten years;
the last time they hunted him
down was when lie applied for a
school in Arizona, whither he
went to get out of reach of his
persistent enemies, and 1 told
them that if any man or set of
men should ever follow and
hound me as these men arc
hounding McXaughton I would
shoot them down in their
tracks."2

Opening and Operation of a
Larg-e Plant.
DENVER, June 2:!. -The situation so far
as fh< relations between the smelters and
their employes is concerned seems to be
unchanged. No movement has been made
by either si<l<- toward a settlement, so far
as can be learned.
The Smelter Men's Union held its re^u

principal rr.,;;t-r under discussion was the
proposition to establish an independent
smelter <>n a co-operative basis, it has
been suggested that a donation of $] per
capita from the American Federation of
Labor and the Western Federation of
Miners would be ample to erect and oper
ate a very large plant. The officers of' the
union refused to confirm the rumor, but
it Is stated <,n pood authority that the
matter has been discussed.

cash for their purchases instead <>f th<
usual custom of part cash and the rest on

ha.v< more money than can be well placed
to advantage, and one result of this im
usual condition of affairs is the recent
action of the German Savings Hank In
reducing the amount which it will iccept
from an Individual depositor to $3m>o. This
will seriously interfere with the practice
of many interior banks which have '-.een

SHIPPING FRUIT
BY WELLS-FARGO
Fresno Growers Adopt
an Innovation.
RESULTS OF EXPERIMENTS
FEASIBILITY OF THE PLAN
DEMONSTRATED.
Necessity of Refrigeration Done Away
With, and the Orchardist Is En
abled to Select a Market
Himself.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO, Juno 2.:.â Growers of green
fruit in this county have devised a new
method of defeating the cupidity of the
n frigerator car combine. The plan is
to ship their products by express and
thereby do away altogether with the ne
cessity of refrigeration. An agreement
has been enti red Into with the Wells-
Fargo Company by which the growers
have obtained reduced rates on all ship
ments of grt en fruit.
The plan was devised early in the
season by H. V. Armitage and a number
of the local growers. Small consignments
of green fruits were sent to various parts
of the United States as an experiment,
and the returns left no doubt as to the
feasibility of the plan, it has been im
possible to fill the orders which have been
received during the lost few days.
The fruit shipped so far has been for
the most part apricots, peaches, plums
and figs. Sime of these have been sent
as ;'ar East as Chicago and New Or
leans and were found to be in good con
dition upon their arrival. It is the Inten
tion to send carload consignments of fruit
to Chicago and Minneapolis In competi
tion with the refrigerator companies.
The chief advantage of the plan accrues
to the small grower. Heretofore it has
been necessary under the refrigerator sys
tem to send a whole carload or none'at
all. Un;!<T the express plan a few boxes
at a time may be sent. The result is
that wh'-re the small grower heretofore
has been limited to the local market,
which is often glutted, he now has opened
to him all the cities of the Western
States am! even Chose as far East as
Chicago and New Orleans.
COMPANY C TO MARCH
DOWN THE MOUNTAINS
Will Tramp From Nevada City to

been received at the office of the adjut
ant general that Company C, Second
Infantry, N. G. C, of Nevada City, will
attend the Fourth of July celebration
in this city, and that it will march the
entire seventy miles, stopping at the
different towns along the route.
The members of the company are en
thusiastic over the proposition of a
military march through the mountains,
' and feel that the trip will tend to a
i certain degree to harden them into solr
diers. They realize that the weather is
I apt to be pretty warm, but there are no
; weak ones in the company, and all are
eager for the trip.
The plan is to assemble at the armory j
at Nevada City at 8 o'clock on Wednes- :
day evening, June 28, and to commence
the march at 2 o'clock the following
Thursday morning. The expectation is |
that the company will arrive at Au
burn, flacer County, over thirty miles
from Nevada I'ity, in the evening- of!
Thursday. A reception will be given to :
the soldiers t Auburn, and. it is said,
the tntin town will turn nut to greet
and entertain them. Brigadier General j
T. W. Sheehan, retired, of this city,
Colonel J. W. Gjuthrie and .staff and
Major \Y. W. Douglas and staff of the
Third Brigade >â  iii meet the company
at Auburn in time to take part in the |
reception.
On Friday the company expects to

serving theii eleventh enlistment. The
company will be the guest of the city
arid the general committee on celebra
tion on the Fourth of July.

Some Doubt Cast Upon a Tale of
Suffering in Quest of Riches
of the Sierra

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN ItIEGO. June 23.â J. P. Cantlin of
this city, one of the charterers of the
schooner Thomas S. Negus, has received
a letter from the purser of the vessel. L.
J. Allen, dated June IT. the day the St.
Denis left San Rogue Bay for this port.
Mr. Allen wrote .iust before tl c St. Penis
sailed, fie had .just returned from a
visit to Captain Geronimo Rlberra of the
schooner Albina, which had arrived from
Guaymas, Mexico, with $5000 wÂ«.rth of
merchandise for trading and six passen
gers.
Captain Rlberra brought the report that
! a party of thirty Mexicans who had 1.-ft
s ,- 1 1 1 Ignaclo landing, on the gulf side,
! about forty days before to go overland to
I the mines bad lost Its way. and that the
i entire party had perished of thirst. Their
1 corpses, according to the report, ha! b< â¢ n
| discovered on the desert by another party.
There was a great deal of excitem> i ; at
! Guaymas over the reported discoveries ;it
1 Sierra Pintada. and parties were being or
ganized almost daily to go overland to the
'Colorado River, thence down tne river to
i San Ignaclo Lagunas and overland u> the
I mines. Three other schooner? owned by
i the company possessing the Albina were
on the way to the placers from Guaymas.
' and It is the evident intention of the Mex
icans to make a permanent camp there.
i Mr. Allen wrote that the Negus would
i sail as soon as he could make up a load
! of passengers.
Some doubt is cast upon the report that
! the thirty Mexicans perished, as there
i are no extensive deserts in that part of
1 Lower California. There are numerous
small stretches of pnnd at Intervals, how
* ever, but It seems unlikely that a body
â  of thirty men wou.d be entirely wiped out.

NEW YORK, June 2".â A report was

said to be the connecting link between

No official of the New York Central or

night to confirm or deny the rumor. Sev

ALGER FORMS
AN ALLIANCE
WITH PINGREE
Political Move That May Hasten
His Retirement From the
Cabinet.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLINGTON HOTEL. WASHINGTON,
June 23.â Secretary Alger's jmlitioal alliance with Governor Pinsree of
Michigan will make his retention in the Cabinet more difficult than ever.
Pingree has been regarded us the head <>f an anti -administration fac
tion among Michigan Republicans, while Senator McMillan, against whom
the Alger-Pingree alliance is directed, Is a supporter of the administration
and is expected to head the Michigan delegation to the next Republican
convention, supporting McKinley for a renomination. Unless Secretary Al
ger can bring his new political partner around to an earnest support of
â :. inisti-atii.il. it is difficult to see how he can consent to remain longer
in the Cabinet or how President McKinley can afford to retain him if he
is willing to stay.
Whether any immediate change results from Mr. Alger's combination
with Pingree or not, it is certain that it will lead to a hard struggle over
the Michigan Senaiorship.
DETROIT, June- 23.â Governor Fingree
gav< out a public statement to-daj
to ilif effect that he had com
with Secretary A'gt-r in the int
of Alger's Senatorial candidacy. Gen ral
AJger will not withdraw under any cir
cumstances, nor will he spend any m
in the campaign. The platform of their
campaign will include opposition to trusts
and .t declaration in favor of Senatorial
elections by a popular vote. The alliance
was made at a conf< n nee hel .
at whi.h several of the Pingree SI
leaders and I - erai and the Governor
were present. Said the Governor:
"1 have avoided committing myself
tofore because I wanted an oppor
tunity t.> talk with the general first. But
;ill along General Alger has been my per
sonal eh- lei S< ator. I wired him at
Petoskey asking him if I could see him
in Detroit on his w . back to Washing
ton. In reply he arranged t.> meet mi Ils
evening. <>i course i can't speak for my
friends, but those I have talked with are
Alger men beyond all question. They ean
atoi M :Milian. Thej' cer
tainly cannot be classed as friends of
mine If they do. They cannot forget eight
years of political history In a aay, ti<>r
can they live with the representatives of
'judicious combinations' and unequal tax
ation and pretend at t)i >- same unii- t'i be
friends of equal and just taxation and
foes to t rusts.
"At our meeting last night Genera! Al
ger tol i us frankly the history of, his re
lations with Senator McMillan In the
matter of the Sonatorship. He has deait
with General Alger the same as he lias
treated every one who questions hi.- own
ership of the Republican party.
"<;â¢!!< nil Alger is In the race and to
stay to the end," said the Governor, "and
you can say In the strongest English you
write ! am with him heartily and I
propose to do all I personally and with
my friends to aid his can lidacy. -As
General Alger put it to me, he will be a
date if he lias assurances for no
than one- vote in the Legislature. I
said to Alger that r could ma personally
suppori a man who would not declare
himself on the right Hide of two of the
greatest questions of the dayâ tbos< â¢â¢â¢:

wish to say that the general is absolutely
sound on i.nth these questions."

A Louisville Convention
Breaks Up in Disorder.
.â -â  lip. in! Dispatch to Tho C^n.
LOUISVILLE, June 23.â For the
third time in as many days the Demu
cratic State convention to-night broke
disorder. It will enter upon the
fourth day of its sessii n to-morrow
vilhout having accomplished anything
ih.in temporary organization. The
report of the committee on credentials
*\a.s reached in the order of business
to-night, but its consideration was pre
vented by the disturbing influence of
persons who were admitted to the floor
of thf convention, though not entitled
to se;us. The Hardin people place the
responsibility for this on local sym
pathizers with the Stone-Goebel com
bination, but the latter candidates tiis
claim all knowledge of an attempt to
pack th conventii n and declare the
disturbance was due to loose methods
of the arrangements committee. What.
Influence the occurrence will have on
the chances of the candidates can
hard(y be foretold, but Hardin is most
likely to profit by it. It is thought the
coi vention will get down to work in
earnest to-morrow.
The first i utbreak came this after
noon, after Chairman Redwine had de
clared the convention adjourned until
evening on a viva voce vote and had
refused to order a call of the delegates
by cuunties. This was the fourth time
the cony. ntion had been so adjourned
since Wednesday night.
Judge Redwine left his seat, but not
so the delegates. There were loud pro
tests from the Hardin faction. Charles
Bronston, one of the leaders of that
side, mounted the Stage and made a
speech, which threw the delegates into
an uproar. Finally he said: "But we
we must be patient. Come back at 8
o'clock and let us settle our differences
in this ha'J. If this convention is again
declared adjourned without regard to
the rights of the delegates we will elect
another chairman and proceed with the
business that brought us here."
This brought cheers from both sides,
and after the several minutes of grad
ually subsiding excitement the hall was
cleared. The delegates came back from
dinner much refreshed and with vocal

at present taking life easy at the home
erf his daughter, Mrs. Charles Pike, after
his trip in Northern Michigan and Wis
consin. He gave his platform on the
heels of the announcement by Governor
Pingree, who, commented the Secretary
of War, "always gets in ahead."
"It is perhaps a little early to say that
trusts and trust legislation are to be a
great factor in the coming elections."
said Genera] Alger. "Other issues of
greater importance may arise, but how
ever that may be, it is certain that me
widespread spirit of consolidation of
financial interests is an evil which must
be contended against. lam a foe to those
great amalgamations and believe in the
election of Senators by a direct vote of
the people, and. as Governor Pingree
states, on those planks I will stand.
"The concentration of wealth in trusts
is detrimental to the Interests of the peo
ple. It squeezes the small .dealer out of
business and, worst of all, eliminate?
the middle man and stifles competition.
With a certain commodity controlled by
one man or a coterie of men, they are not
compelled to seek customers. The dealer
must come to the trust, take what he can
get and pay without a murmur the prices
asked.
"Everywhere manufacturers are meet-

for. A Senatorial ticht in a State Legis

who is more the representative of a ma
chine than of the people.
"The contest in Michigan for the nomi
nation will lie a fair stand-up tight. Mr.
McMillan, aided, I believe, by Burrows,
will try for renominatlon. Governor Pin
gree has shown himself very friendly to
me. and especially since the beginning of
the war. â¢ It is too early to make calcula
tions on the strength of the force which
will contend, but there will not be two
Republican candidates in the Held â noth
ing to disrupt the party."
1 chords in good condition for a renewal
of the disorder of the afternoon. The
, first hour was passed uproariously. The
Hardin people 'called attention to a
i number of persons sitting: In the hall,
i who. they charged, were not entitled to
seats. They made frantic appeals for
the ejection of these people, Baying un
complimentary things of the Louisville
police and urging that the convention
j be adjourned to Lexington. One or two
i speeches by cooler heads s< rved to quiet
I things, and nt fl o'clock the credentials
committee was ready to report.
This announcement, for which the
convention had been waiting for three
days, did not meet with the reception
; that might have been expected. Dis- :
order continued and adjournment was
finally taken until '.< o'clock to-morrow
morning. The Hardin nun are very bit
ter over Co-nighfs developments, and,
leaving aside the Question of n-sponsi
bility for the conditions that existed,
the moral effect cannot fail to be dam
airing to the Stone-Ooebel combination.
TREAT IN STORE FOR
COAST THEATER-GOERS
Sir Henry Irving and Mrae. Sarah I
Bernhnrdt Are Coming to
California.
LOS ANGELES, June 23.â Mrs. Harry j
C. Wyatt. wife of the theatrical man
ager, who yesterday returned from an
l Eastern trip, gives information that is
1 pleasing to the theater-goers on the
coast. Mrs. Wyatt says that both Sir
Henry Irving and Madame Sarah Bern
hardt, supported by their respective
European companies, will be seen at the
! Los Angeles Theater next autumn.
Mrs. Wyatt derived this information
from Julius Cohn, the Western booking
agent for the Frohman-Hayman and
Klaw-Erlanger theatrical syndicates.
The dates for the appearance of the
European stars have not yet been fixed.
It is probable the Irving engagement
will extend over three nights and a
matinee, and among the plays present
ed will be Irving's two great successes,
"The Bells" and "Hamlet." "Kobes
pierrc" will, of course, be presented, for |
it is to be the piece de resistance of
Irving's tour.
Mine. Bernhardt, it is thought, will
not present more than two bills in Los '
Angeles. The divine Sarah was here '
seven or eight years ago and made one
appearance in "La Tosca." Seats sold
for $5 on that occasion, but theatrical
times are better in Los Angoles now
and a longer engagement with lower
prices may be hoped for.
Each of these artists will bring a full
1 company, numbering about forty firs;

Special Cable to The <'ali and the New York

iion Bennett.
THE HAGUE. June 23.âTrou
ble concerning the young Turks'
agitation having broken out, I
learn to-night the Turkish dele
gates threatened to withdraw
and return to Constantinople if
Achmet Tiza and other agitators
were not expelled, a measure
which the Dutch Government
shrank from taking on account
of its unpopularity in liberal,
hospitable Holland.
Achmet Tiza and the Arme
nian, Peter Ammeghian, leave
The Hague to-morrow for Paris
without fighting a duel. They
have been quietly prevailed upon
by tht: Dutch Government to
leave and avoid further trouble.
M. de Staal, president of the Peace
Conference, at a meeting of the com
mittee to-day introduced the Russian
proposals looking to the arrest of arm
aments and read a declaration dis
claiming all intention to propose a re
duction of the armaments at present.
But, he added, he was of the opinion
that if a standstill could be agreed up
on a reduction would soon come of it
self.
All the powers, he explained, had
conferred with the Czar relative to the
immense evils of armed peace, and he
(M. de Staal) now appealed to them to
devote their energies toward the arrest
of the continual increase in the cost of
armed peace, w hich, he asserted, cost
more than a ten-years' war;
Count Golinski of the liussian dele
gation moved that the powers should
enter into an understanding for a term
of, say, five years, not to increase th-
effective ness of the peace footing of
their forces, with the exception of the
colonial troops, and not to increase the
amount of their military budgets be
yond their present figure.
The speeches and the resolutions
were ordered to be printed and circu
late-], and the discussion was adjourned
until Monday. A naval standstill reso
lution will be introduced later.
The drafting committee of the arbi
tration committee spent the afternoon
in considering articles 1 and 7 ol the
Russian proposals. All that is left now
is the drafting of regulations for the
board's t>ro< edure.
The information from Germany is
that Emperor William will not separate
himself from the other powers on the
arbitration question, and the German
delegates expect a favorable decision
on that point.
The work is now so far advanced that
the conference probably will take a
holiday after June 28, in order to allow
the delegates to refer to their respec
tive governments for final instructions.
Frederick HoUs <>f the American dele
gation, alluding this evening to the
i ;- rman attitude, said:
"This matter is much exaggerated.
Active negotiations look place, but Ger
many is in no way irreconcilable and
would not hesitate, more than any other
power, to agree to an arbitration court
established on an acceptable basis.
"The Turks themselves state that no
one is able to say that they object to
the arbitration scheme and that when
the proposal has been finally shaped
they will examine it and only then give
nn opinion, referring to Constantinople
if the wording of the scheme contains
points not covered by their instruc
tions."

ING TOLD BY DR. COOKE.
It Will Add Greatly to Scientific and
Geographical Knowledge and
Also Provide New Charts
tor Mariners,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, June 23.â Frederick A.
Cook, surgeon of the Belgica Antarctic
expedition, reached home to-day on the
steamship Buffon from Rio de Janeiro
after an absence of nearly two years.
When seen at the home of his brother,
William L. Cook, 679 Bedford avenue,
to-night, he outlined the results of the
expedition us follows:
"On the whole, the expedition was
exceedingly successful. We were not
in search of the South Pole and so are
not disappointed that we did not bring
it back with us. The most important
results of the expedition were the ob
taining of complete series of magnetic
observations extending throughout the
whole year within ihe Antarctic cir
cle and the making of the first profile
of the ocean's bed to the south of Cape
Horn. We have, besides, obtained an
exceedingly valuable collection of the
fauna and flora of the Antarctic circle.
From a geographical standpoint, two
important facts were ascertained, one
being that Hughes Gulf, supposed to
be an indentation of the coast of Gra
ham's Land, is noi a gulf at all, but a
strait more than two hundred miles in
l. ngth and about thirty miles broad.
It has on Hi. c side Graham's Land and
on the other the islands of an archipel
ago. The second important discovery
was that of a bank, over which we
drifted to and fro, where soundings
slMu ( d ihj.' depth to be in places only
about 45u meters,
"I have about 2000 photographs taken
among the Islands of a newly discov
ered archipelago and among Indian
tribes on an island at the south of Cape
Horn which I visited after the return
of the Belgica.
"Leaving Brooklyn on September 1,
lsy:, 1 Joined the Belgica at Rio de Ja
neiro. We left Kh> in October, passed
Montevideo and Punta Arenas, and
thence westward through the Straits
of Magellan and Beagle Canal to
(Jshina, where we look on our last coal.
We left civilization early in January,
1898.
"The soundings made south of Shet
land Islands showed an unexpected
depth. They were from 3000 to 4000 feet
and the greatest depth attained was
13.251 feet. For the greater part of the
way the ocean bed seemed to be a vast
plateau.
"Before reaching the Shetland Isl
ands one of tli'' sailors, a man named
I Wencke, was lost overboard in a storm.
"We entered Hughes Gulf and made
about twenty landings. The only living
things we found on those islands were
four kinds of insects. We found two
spiders covered with fur. There were
also a few specimens of moss and lich
ens. Passing out into the Pacific, we
turned to the south. We sighted Alex
ander Island, also Adelaide Island. The
latter we found to be much larger than
i has been supposed. We then continued
on tn the south and entered a pack of
ice, finally reaching 70 degrees south
I latitude. We penetrated ninety miles
into the fl<>e and were frozen in in
March, 1898. We remained in the floe
fur about thirteen months. During the
! greater part of the time the floe was
j swept by terrific storms.
"Antarctic night came on in May and
we were in darkness for seventy days.
During that time every member of the
party suffered from anaemia, due to the
excessive humidity of the night, to
lack of fresh food and to continuous
'â  storms. Lieutenant Dance, the mag
netician, died. Our meteorological ob
servations during this time were ex
ceedingly valuable. The chart of mag-
I netic variations we made indicates that
the magnetic pole is probably 2uo miles
east of the location made out by Sir
Jan â  s Ross in his expedition of 1839 to
1843. The aspect of the ice field in the
Antarctic differs considerably from that
in the Arctic regions. The pack is some
: what heavier and 'pans' are consider
ably smaller. Our vessel was subjected
: to severe crushing when we entered the
pack and later as we began to fight
our way out. We drifted about 2000
miles. "With the approach of summer
! the ice field began to open somewhat,
and in March we succeeded in making
i our way out. At the last we were
obliged 10 cut a canal a mile in length
through ice live feet thick. Every man,
from commander to cook, worked at the
saws. Once free, we broke up the
: blocks with dynamite."
Dr. Cook's plans do not include fur
ther Arctic or Antarctic exploration.
lie said that it would take him several
years to prepare f<-r publication the
materials obtained in his various ex
peditions, Arctic and Antarctic.

Firs Sweeps a Grain Field.
WOODLAND, June 23.â A special to the
Democrat says a disastrous* grain field
fire occurred on the farm of Henry Greg
ory, two miles east of College City, on
Thursday afternoon. The flames ran over
150 acres of heavy wheat before they were
ch< eked. The flre probably originated
from a spark from an engine that is op
erating in the neighborhood.

t-aid Judge BldckÃtock to-day. "I have
an idea that the Stockton differenti-il

board made the rate of 3U cents. The
' Southern Pacific people first Insisted upon
50 cents, and later were willing to split
the difference with us and make it 40

Special Dispatch to The Call.
PHOENIX. Ariz.. June
Murphy's official letter published yester
day, warning investors against certain
stock jobbing mining companies in this
Territory who are. booming their stocks
through miserpresentation. and denounc
ing the Val Verde Copper Company in
particular, has brought a horde of tele
grams of protests and requests for re
tractions from Eastern stockholders.
Representatives of some <>f the mining
companies denounced have arrived here
and will try to provr to the Governor
that their concerns are legitimate, and
ask for protection and retraction in their
respective cases. Strong efforts are be
ing made by them to get the Territorial
press on their side. Every indication
shows that the mining companies named
in the Governor's letter will make a des
perate tight ami bring strong pressure
to bear on him for retraction. Vicious
attacks are also being made on Lester
Jackson, the mining expert who exam
ined the Val Verde properties and re
ported them practically worthless, which
report was included in the Governor's
letter. Many mining companies in this
Territory have spent large sums booming
their stocks in the East, selling them at
ligures not warranted by facts, upon
claims of their nearness to and on thÂ»
same vein that well-known diviaend pa>
ing mines are located.
Governor Murphy left for Las Vegas
last night to attend the Rough Riders'
reunion, but gave out that he would not
retract a word. The Territorial press is
standing by him in his efforts to expose
the mining concerns whose only inten
tions are to sell stock at the expense of
the Territory's mining reputation and
thus drive away legitimate capital.
The right between the Governor and the
mining companies is being watched with
much interest in mining and financial
circles.

HAVE FINISHED THEIR
HIGH SCHOOL COURSE
Stockton Students Awarded Diplomas
Earned by Attention to Their
Books.
STOCKTON, Juno 28. â Thirty-eight
bright pupils of the Stockton High School
received their coveted diplomas to-day.
Larger classes have been graduated from
the school, but never one which had
higher averages or more promise. There

comes the senior with the reopening of the
school, contains even more in the general
average.
The exercises were held in the high
school department of the Washington

parents but by many prominent citizens,
who take a keen Interest in the affairs of
the school and pride in the position it haÂ«
attained among similar institutions of the
State.

tion of the class picture to the Board of
Education, the board being its custodian,
r,Â« the picture Is to hang in the class
room. City Superintendent Barr accepted
the picture with appropriate remarks.
Miss Bessie Rosenbaum rendered a solo.
Professor D. A. Moberly made an address
to the class full of kindly recollections for
the past and hopes for the future of those
just entering the practical spheres of life.
The diplomas were then handed to the
graduates by President Holman of the
Board of Education.
The valedictarian- of the class was
Edward Gould. The brief exercises closed
with the class song.
The graduates were: August Pahl. "Wil

Pulmonary Troubles.
Special Dispatch to The Cril.
ATLANTIC CITY. -V. .1.. June T,.â At
to-day's session of the American Institute
of Homeopathy the board of censors rec
ommended the election of forty-two ap
plicants for membership and also report
ed sixteen new applications. This makes
a total "f 213 members elected during the
â nt convention. The committee on
medical education recommended that the
institute encourage medical teaching in
State universities; that colleges should l"
liberally endowed; that instructors should
be salaried where possible: that no teach
j ing should be permitted except from thosi
spi cially trained for the respective de
partments, and that all colleges should
i have uniform curriculum for entrance, m
; terxnedJate and final examinations and
: study. This was adopted.
The resolution warning physicians
against sending thoir patients to opti
riii'.s who have no medical training wa-3
adopted. Considerable time was taken
up in the adoption of a number of amend
ments to the by-laws, after which the
delegates paid a tribute to Dr. B. M. Kel
logg of New York. w!n> has been treasurer
for thirty-three years, and who now vol
untarily relinquishes that position. A com
mittee to present i suitable testimonial
to the veteran treasurer was appointed.

Alonzo Bootnhy of Boston, 1.. F. Bailey ol
Lincoln, Nebr., C. S. Reynolds of Minne
apolis and J. it. Kippex of Chicago were
appointed a committee on tinamc for the
Hahnemann monument fund.
The report of the intercollegiate com
mittee was completed by Dr. Kippex.
1 Among the recomm ndations made and
'adopted was one thai after the present
j year all medical colleges shall have a
course of four years of not less than
i seven months each instead of six months.
The formal announcement of the el'ction
j of officers hell yesterday was made.
Pharmacopeia held the attention of the
delegates for the remainder of the
Bession.
The feature of the afternoon was the
section in clinical medicine and pathology,
in which pulmonary tuberculosis was
thoroughly discussed. The first paper
read was that of Dr. Charles (iatchell of
Chicago cm "Prevention and General
Treatment of Pulmonary Tuberculosis."
Then followed several others papers and
open discussions on tuberculosis in its
various stages and the treatment and pre
vention of tli' disease. Among the speak
ers were William L. Woodruff, Phoenix.
Ariz.; W. H. Uanchctt. Omaha, Neb., and
A. M. dishing. Springfield, Mass. Dr.
j Cushlng said that if the physician would
give the consumptive patient five or six
eggs in lemonade each day he would have
no funerals.
The section in neurology and electro
therapeutics had a special meeting this
afternoon. Dr. W. P. Carpenter of Co
lumbus delivered an address on "auto
intoxication as influencing cases of men
tal depression."
The institute reassembled at S o'clock
to discuss surgery. The first jiaper was
by Dr. S. S. Symthe of Denver, who made
a special address on "homeopathy as re
lated to gynecology."
The graduates of Hahnemann College
of Philadelphia treated the delegates to
night to a "Night In Bohemia."
SCHEME TO LOWER PRICES.
Fruit-Buyers Delay the Making of
Contracts for Crops.
MARYSVILLK, June 23.âHorticultur
ists of iMs section are anxious regarding
the prices they are to receive for their
fruit this season. The managers of the
canneries have told them they had in
structions to make no figure? on fruit
crops before July 8. One grower said to
day:
"I take that to mean that thf> combine
has a Bcheme on foot. It proposes to hold
off until the fruit is thoroughly ripened
on the trees, and. consequently. 'in a con
dition that will force the grower to dis
pose of his product at the first oppor
tunity. Early in the season we were led
to believe choice peaches would bring $45
and JGO a ton, but now we are told we
must consider ourselves in luck if we get
$30 or $35 a ton."
Want r Free Ferry.
TtIO VISTA. June 23.â The petition of
Yolo County residents in the vicinity of
Freeport to the Sacramento Board of Su
pervisors, asking that body not to grant
the De goto ferry franchise, has provoked
a class war in that section. Instead of tie
toll ferry the Yoloites desired a free
ferry, but met organized opposition by
the Sacramttitana residing along the river
who claim they have been unable to oh
tain much-needed improvements, and,
therefore, do not want to pay Yolo citi
zens' ferriage. In the vicinity of Walnut
Grove a bridge is wanted across Geor
giana Slough, but for two years the mat
ter has hung fire. This is given a? a
reason for the opposition to the Voloites.
The proposed bridge would be a groat
benefit to residents of that vicinity. It is
estimated $3000 would cover the entire
coet of construction.
OGILVIE DENIES
RESPONSIBILITY
â¢Royalty Charges Not
Based on His Reports.
BLAMES SENSATIONAL PRESS
STATES THAT HE NEVER AD
VISED THEIR IMPOSITION.
He Has Great Faith in the District
and Holds to His Estimate
of the Output Made
Two Years Ago.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA. B. C. June 23.â A late issue
of the Klondike Miner received here to
day has the following interview with
Commissioner Ogilvie on the Yukon
royalty:
'â¢As to the royalties, I never advised
their Imposition and I do not believe that
my reports have been responsible for it.
I have reported a great faith in the coun
try and stated the facts upon which I
base my faith, and that faith I still Jiuve.
By order in council of July 2S, 1897, the
regulations which pr.vious to that time
exacted a royalty <.f 2 per cent were
amended, making the royalty 10 and 20
per cent, according to the product of the
mine, as is well known. Had my reports
been 'responsible in any way for this the
change must have been made long before.
The last reports which I sent to Ottawa
from this region previous to my arrival
there in person were dispatched about
the middle of January, 1897. I have as-
Berted, not only as the result of my own
observations but those of men upon whom
I can rely, that Bonanza from No. 60 be
low to No. ft) above, will !â â ' good for $30.
--000,000, and thai El Dorado will produce
tin- same sum and that the whole district
in the vicinity of Dawson will probably
yield $100.000,0<>u.
"I do not believe any of these Btate
ments are exaggerations. What really
led t" the Imposition of the royalty, in my
belief, was the grossly exaggerated state
ments in Ihe newspapers of the U'estt m
coast, which papers seemed to vie with
one another in printing the most sensa
tional tales nt th.- w.-alth brought out by
the miners who landed at Seattle and San
Francisco.
'"Most of them were absurd inventions.
If not of th,' miners themselves, then of
the reporters; but they were sent by wire
over the world and were accepted no
doubt by the people <>f Canada as truth,
and it was the wish of the people that the
gr'at expense that this new country was
then piling up at Ottawa should be met
in some measure at least out of these
vast sums that 'he ground was said to be |
yielding up. That is the explanation of
the royalty. It will be removed imme- ;
diately upon this impression being cor- [
rected." I
NORTHERNERS FAVOR
ANTI-TRUST CONFERENCE
There Is a Marked Apathy in the

AUSTIN, Texas, June ::. Governor

nearly all of the Northern and Eastern
States dr. the suiij-et of the proposed
anti-trust conference to he held in St.
Louis and whb a f< w exceptions they an
all in favor of th< movement. The < ;>>v
ernors of th,' Smith- rn a:.d far Western
States are slow i;> responding to the In
vitation vi attend thi i ice, which
is an Indication that they are Indifferent
on the subject. Governor Bayers re
ceived a letter from Governor Frank W*.
Kmmlijm.s of New Hampshire to-day as
fellows:
"I would be giad to attend the confer
ence of Governors, as you suggest, but
owing to other official duties it will be
impossible for m> to do SO."
Divorced From Erring Pastor.
STOCKTON, June 23.â Jennie E. Jones
was to-day granted a decri c of divorce
from K. A. Jones. The decree was given
on a default to charms of desertion. The
defendant will be remembered as a Clem
ents preacher who achieved a wider repu
tation as a lawbreak v than as a minister
of the gospel. He (led when the charge
tiiat he forged the name of Mrs. Putman
was made against him. Since then nothing
has been heard of him. Jones was well
connected in this county, but evil pro
clivities kept him In trouble.

city or town bred man who has all his life
humped his back over a de3k, living an
unhealthy, sedentary life and failed to take
any care of his health, could not stay on
the back of one of these vicious brutes for
more than three jumps.
It takes a whole man to conquer a vicious
animal. People may talk about intellectual
superiority and refinement and good breed-
ing, but every man takes off his hat to
physical strength and endurance. While
the man who leads a sedentary life cannot
hope, in this respect, to rival these sturdy
men of the plains, they can be sound, vig-
orous, healthy men if they will. It is a
matter of care of health while one has it,
and the proper measures to restore it when
it is lost. Most diseases begin with some
trouble of the digestive organs or of the
liver. Troubles of, this nature starve the
body, because they prevent it from receiv-
ing its proper supply of nourishment. Dr.
Pierces Golden Medical Discovery gives a
man an appetite like a cow-boy's and the
digestion of an ostrich. Its great work is
upon the stomach, large inter-tines and liver.
These are the organs that nourish a man's
body. This medicine makes them strong,
vigorous and healthy. It fills the blood
with the nourishment that builds new,
solid and healthy flesh, muscle and nerves.
" I am now enjoying magnificent health, after
having suffered for years with chronic catarrh."
writes Ramon Sanchez, Esq.. of Penasco. Taos
Co.. New Mexico. "By the use of your ' Golden
Medical Discovery' I have recovered my health,
and am now. physically a sound man, attending
to ray business and enjoying life."

STOPS A BIG JOB.
No Money Now for the Panhandle
Extension Titles,
City and County Attorney Lane has
filed an opinion with the Board of Super
visors relative to the necessity of award-
Ins the contract to furnish title insurance
for the property embraced in the park
panhandle extension, which will put a stop
to the plan to pay something over $25,000
a th( present time for titles. Attorney
Lane says, in part:
The board has decided by resolution to con
demn certain property for park purposes. This
i.rop^rtv must he paid for by the sale of bonds.
To ascertain the probable cost of the property
your board has decided to have the property
appraised by a board of appraisers. Upon the
r.port of these experts It may be deemed wise
by your board to all a bond election, or It may
not If you <3n not call such election the pro
ceedings "will there end, as It would be Idle to
b.-Kin pminont domain proceedings without pos
sibility of paying tor the property. If you call
such election the people will then determine
whether they want this improvement, and if
they â iocid* In favor of the bond issue it will
then b" proper to secure abstracts of title or
i ther â¢ .idence of the necessary parties defend
er : ! can see no reason why. the appointment
. â¢ ippraisers should wait upon the securing of
title insurance or abstracts of title. The ap
-1 '.'sfrs must do their work prior to the bond
<-i->.-t!on that the I pie may know how larce
an Issue of bonds may be needed. The city
surely should not expend money now for ab
stracts which would be altogether wasted if
the vote of the people was adverse to the
B'-culsition of the property. I advise that the
contract between the city and the appraisers
be executed if it is your intention to call a
bond election, and that all other matters relat
ing to the contemplated condemnation proceed
ing* be deferred until after the proposed bond

SHOT HER SON-IN-LAW.
Judge Graham Held That Mrs. Bertha,
Pilcher Was Justified.
Mrs. Bertha Pilcher appeared in Judpe
Graham's court yesterday morning on her
preliminary examination for assault to
murder In shootinK her son-ln-law, An
tonio Guatelli, In the neck at her resi
dence near the Five Mile House about a

iJuatelll took the stand and admitted
thai he went to his mother-in-law's house
and broke the windows and door with the
butt end of a revolver. While engaged
in that pastime his mother-in-law fired
a shot at him and the bullet struck him
in the neck. In answer "to the Judge's
questions, he said ho broke the windows
and door as a joke.
The Judge dismissed the case, holding

HIS SHROUD, THE FLAG.
HIS TRIBUTE, MEMORY
THE hody of Lieutenant Philip
I-ansdale. h?r<Â» of Samoa, was
laid away yesterday on the nills
of Cypress Lawn Cemetery. His
prave lies hirrh up on a ridjz'- in
Ip shadow of the peaks of San Bruno
fountain; the west wind sine:? a lulla-
by from the sea among the trees over
his head, and to where a new-made
mound marks the place of his resting,
a Hue rift of the ocean throws hack
a etas, loss farewell to oik- of its ni"st
loyal sens. His shroud is the flag he
served bo faithfully, and the earth that
covers his ashes'is heavy with flowers
strewn on his bier by those who loved
him.
With military promptitude the fu
neral train formed on the wharf. There
was a. detehment of blue jackets and
a detachment of marine? on foot, the
band of the Philadelphia and all her
officers. The unaccustomed sight of
seamen on parade told at once the tale
of the flag-draped hearse and its bur
den, and as the line passed up the
street Hags were lowered to half-nn^t
ar..l men stood uncovered until the
procession had passed. Up Market
street to Golden Gate avenue, out
Golden Gate avenue to Van Ness ave
nue, and then up to the church of SI.
Luke, where the services were to he
held, the escort and its charge Blowiy
made its nay.
The church was dressed as if for a
weakling; the flowers were the same
and in profusion as great as any bride
could desire; roses of red and of white;
lilies, ferns and brakes and corn
flowers robbed the chancel rail of its
bareness and lent their fragrance and
th-ir beauty, and .ilgh over the altar
a single star of flame blazed from the
gref-n of maidenhair and the glint of
crimson carnations. Only a single
wisp of crape threw Its gloom over the
scene ami changed the character and
the meaning of the heaping blossoms.
The wall of the band heralded tin?
approach of the bier and then the
organ took up the sound and filled the.
church with the notes of a dirge.
Chaplain McAllister led the train up
the aisle, chanting the opening words
of the Episcopal service for the dead.
tecting her property from destruction.
Mrs. Pilcher has been suffering from hys
teria since her arrest and yesterday after
noon was taken to the German Hospital.
Youths' Directory Baazar.
The general committee in charge of the
Youths' Directory Bazaar held its regu
lar bi-monthly meeting on Thursday even
ing at 2030 Howard street. Encouraging
reports were received from all the sub-
DWELT FORTY YEARS BEHIND
THE WALLS OF SAN QUENTIN
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JUNE 24, 1899.
Just behind him wero Bishop Nichols
Hnii Bishop Moreland, then came the
pallbearers and then the coffin, borno
by eight sturdy, sunbrowned sailors.
The coffin was covered with the na
tional colors and was smothered under
a profusion of flowers, and across 'it
lay the dead man's chapeati and the
sword he had wielded bravely and so
well in defense of his country's honor.
Bishop Moreland read the lesson,
one from St. Paul's epistle to the
Corinthians, and then all knelt In
prayer, which was led by Bishop
Nichols. Two hymns were sung by
the choir during the service and then
with a benediction it ended. The offi
cers, in their gorgeous uniforms,
formed as before after the casket, the
sailors took up their burden and the
congregation rose in deference and re
spect as they bore it down the aisle
and out of the church.
There was a special train in readi
ness at the railroad station at Third
and Townsend streets, and the few
who went to the cemetery boardfd it
at a few minutes before 12 o'clock.
At the cemetery the ground around
tile stopping place had been covered
with matting and around the edges
were thrown little Bprigs of marguer
ites. Upon this carpet the funeral
trjin formed again and then, headed
by the band, it wound its way up the
hill to where the h< ro was to rest.
Despite the boisterous wind from the
beach officers and friends marched un
covered, keeping step to the melan
committees. Communications from prom
inent citizens proved the lively interest
taken in th>' good cause. As usual most
of the talking waa done by the men. but
they gallantly admitted that In this as In
everything else they would be helpless
without the ladies. Hence most of the
measures quietly advocated by the ladies
were adopted. It seems to be settled that
the bazaar will be held in Armory Hall,
near Tenth and Market streets, during
the first two weeks of October. The next
regular meeting will be hold July 6 at
: 20"0 I Inward street. All ino.mhors of the
I committee have been requested to attend.
Wheelmen Want Flat Bails.
The wheelmen are in favor of the flat
'< rail for street car tracks, as is shown by
i the following petition to the Supervisors:
i California Associated Cycling Clubs, San Fran
clfco, June 23. 1889.
; To the Honorable Hoard of Supervisors of the
City and County of San Francisco â Gentlemen:
i I would respectfully recomr">nd as the chief
, officer of the California Associated Cycling
Clubs,' the adoption of the amendment offered
j by Supervisor Bylngton, compelling the use of
the Berlin rail In the construction of all street
railway tracks for which franchises are to be
choly strains of Chopin's dead
march. It was a melody befitting the
placeâ wild and mournful; filled with
the woes of the living and burdened
with their hopes and prayers for the
dead.
Around the grave the ground wnÂ«
also carpeted. The firing squad of
marines took Its stand at one end,
the chaplain and Bishop Moreland at
the other, while on either side stood
the sailors who had carried the bier.
The grave had been changed to a
floral bower. Marguerites and smilax
lined its walls of earth and disguised
Its yawning opening, and more blos-
Boms lii'l the heap of sod that was to
cover it all.
Binhnp Morelar.il read th" prayer, an
Invocation of mercy on the departed
soul and a plea that it be judged not
by Its deserts, but by heaven's grace;
not by the deeds of the man, but by
what he had hoped to accomplish.
Then the firing squad was brought
up beside the grave, and three sharp
granted in the future Thr> measure is one of
interest to the owners of all kinds of vehicles
aside from wheelmen, and I am confident that
! if those who arc must interested un.l.
and appreciated the advantages that would ac
| crue to them by the adoption of th!s roÂ«n]ii
tlon by your honorable board that you would
find the unanimous sentiment Of the rlty in
favor of the measure. Yer â â  truly yours

Row Over a Horse Deal.
Samuel Aftergut, a horse dealer at
AFTER a residence of forty years
off and on, mostly on, within
the brick walls of the Ban Quen
tin Penitentiary. Lum Ah Hing.
Beventy-seven years old, was again re
leased from that institution yester
day morning and given into the cus
tody of United States Marshal Shine.
He will to-day be deported to China
in accordance with the law requiring
the deportation of Chinese felons.
Lum has an eventful history. lie
came from China to California in 1844,
before the discovery of gold. In lS. r .9
he stole a watch and was sentenced to
six years' imprisonment in the peni
tentiary. Having served his time, he
was released, but prison life was
rather agreeable than otherwise and
he stole something else. He was con
victed five times for as many consecu
tive larcenies. The last time he was
convicted he had five "priors" against
him and received a sentence of twenty
years. He wants to be sent home to
China now.
"I go home; I die bimeby; I die in
China," he said.
Hnrtford street, swore to a complaint in
Judge Treadwell'a court yesterday for the
arrest of "John Doe" Jenkins, a black
smith on Natoma street, on the charge
of battery. He alleged that he went to
the Presidio Thursday to soil three
horses. One was accepted and he got $4." (
for it. Jenkins and a cavalry man later
demanded $15 as commission from him and
because he refused they dragged him off
his horse and his right hand was se
verely cut by holding on to the rope at
tached to the animal.
Killing Small Fish.
Deputy Fish Commissioner John Davis
has fifteen more Chinese scalps hanging
at his holt. Yesterday he captured ten
more Asiatic fishermen, who were violat
ing the law by taking young: and small
fish near Hunters Point. The prisoners
were locked up in the City Prison.

Lansdale, Hero of $
Samoa. â¦
volleys cut the air like a whip lash.
The echoes had not died away before
they were again awakened by the
bugler bidding the seaman's farewell,
and as the plaintive melody of "taps"
rang out over the cemetery, the people
withdrew, leaving the grave with Its
own.
In the church were all the officers of
the Philadelphia, General King and
part of his staff and representatives
of Genera! Shatter, besides a number
of friends and relatives. The pallbear
ers were: Fleet Paymaster J. M. Stan

NATIONAL GUARD VETERANS.
A Loving Cup Presented to an Hon
ored Paymaster.
The Veterans, National Guard of Cali
fornia, have presented ex-Captain Charles
P. Le Breton with a beautiful silver lov
ing cup. Captain Le Breton held the po
sition of paymaster of the corps from the
date of its organization up to the annual
election held last month, when he de
clined re-election.
The corps intends giving a reception to
forty comrades upon their return from
the Philippines. The awakened interest
in militia affairs which the contemplated
reorganization of the National Guard is
creating is bringing new members to the
corps, and many former members who
had dropped out are now returning.
JUDGE MORROW HONORED.
Wabash College Confers Upon Him
the Honorary Degree of Doctor
of Laws.
United States Circuit Judge Morrow
was notified yesterday that the faculty
of Wabash College at Crawfordsville,
Ind., had conferred upon him the hon
orary degree of doctor of laws. Craw
fordsville is Judge Morrow's former
home, and it feels proud of Judge Mor
row's career, both as a Congressman and
as a Federal Judge. The Judge visited
his old home in IS9O and delivered an ad
dress to the faculty and students of the
college.
More Smallpox Patients.
A family consisting of the father,
mother, daughter and grandchild â W. L.
Whiting, Mrs. D. Whiting, Mrs. Belle
Kellogg and Arthur Delmerâ were re
moved from 37S San Carlos avenue Thurs
day to the Pesthouse. They were here
on a visit from Placervllle and were
rooming at the house, where it is sup
posed they contracted the disease from a
Mrs. Elizabeth Slmes, who had been a
patient in the Maclean Hospital and who
died from pneumonia at the San Carlos
house on the 7th of the present month.
This is merely conjectural, however, as
the deceased left the Maclean Hospital a.
week before her death.
Dr. Prior, following the example of Dr
TiUman. volunteered from his interne po
sition at the City and County Hospital to
Isolate himself in the Pesthouse to at
tend to the patients in that institution.

Major General George M. Sternberg,

Lieutenant Colonel A. C. Girard. who is
to have charge of the new general hospi

which are to be turned over to the m.-di-
cal department on July 3, and he expri ss-
I ed himself as being highly pleased with
tho new hospital and the thorough man

General Sternbor:? also inspected the
new camps that ar.> being built, the old
23 ' general hospital and the post hospital: in
â¦ fact, he made a thorough inspection of
â¢Â£> the entire post from a sanitary point. The

â¼ than they are at present under the charge

Â« There are now over 300 patients in the

Â£ one is ready they will be transferred, but
â¦ the old hospital will not be at once turned
â¢" over to the post commander for barrack
â¦ t purposes, as it will be necessary to retain
â¢- I it for the accommodoatlon of the surplus

â¢p : hospital. There are 250 sick soldiers com
â¦ i ing on the ship Relief, and when this yes
** sel arrives there will be at least 600 sick
â¦ men at the post. It la doubtful if even
â¢? both hospitals will be large enough to ac
â¦ commodate the soldiers, and since âºhe

HEALTH BOARD
EMPLOYES MAY
BE DISCHARGED
Such Is the Opinion
of Judge Hunt.
THEY CAN RECOVER BY LAW
MAY HOLD ON AND BRING AN-
OTHER SUIT.
Meeting of the Board Will Be Called
in the Near Future and Doubt
less the Slato Will Go
Through.
When the Board of Health adjourned
Wednesday evening it did so to the call of
the chair. Another meeting would be call
ed, the members said, when they learned
just how good Judge Hunt was going to
be to them in the matter of the suit filed
by several under officials to enjoin the
hoard from dismissing them. Judge Hunt
has been good to the members, as they
wished, and now they may call a meet
ing and doubtless when it convenes the
machete will again sowing and the slate
carried through in tcto.
As anticipated, Ju>ige Hunt handed
down his decision In the case yesterday.
Although Judge Hu.it dissolves the order
heretofore issued restraining tta.fi board
; from dismissing tin plaintiffs, no do^s not
de< iric the merits of ilnir contention that
; they are statutory offic< rs and cannot be
dismissed by the appointing power at
j pleasure. The couri simply holds that the
I action to restrain the dismissal .if the
petitioners is erroneous, and that if they
;:r>- dismissed in violation of law they
may have redress in an action at law In
stead of equity, as -a-. is tho action de
cided yi s terday. The decision of the
court reads:
"The plaintiff is the secretary if tho
j Board of Health and \ic has commenced
j this action to enjoin the defendant fmm
removing him from his position. Upon
I the argument counsel discussed the n<ics
-1 Uon whether the plaintiff was an 'officer"
of the beard within the meaning of the
statute or a mere employe; but in view of
: the conclusion I have reached, it is not
necessary to resolve i'lis Question. It has
1 been decided by the Supreme Court of
the United States that a court of equity
â¢ has no pewer to restrain a public officer
from removing an appointee, even if such.
, contemplated removal were wrongful. Any
wrong thus accomplished a court of law
: can imnly redress, and a party thus in
jured may seek relief in the satutory
i way. The restraining order is dissolv <1."
It is said that several of those who ap
', peared as petitioners in the action de
cided by Judge Hunt have concluded to
. resign their positions before The board
! meets and discharges them, but in event
' their counsel, Peter F. Dunne, decides
: that they may still hold if an action at
law is brought for the purpose of deter
mining that eontemi >r they will enter
into the suit and fight it through to the
i end.

WHERE RAILWAY MANAGEMENT
TELLS.
A SAN FRANCISCAN now on his way to
l, in a private letter from Seattle, under
date of June 17. states that Seattle is doing a
deal more Alaskan business than San Fran
cisco, and notes as an evidence that "six steamer?,
heavily laden with freight and passengers, left on as
many day- this last week." He also noted during his
stay the arrival of a lar^e number of miners and
others from Alaskan ports at Seattle, so it is ap
parent the little city t<> the north of us is getting the
Klondike trade Ruing or coming, while we are re
â  g comparatively but a small amount.
explanation of the abnormal course the
Alaskan trade is taking in going to a small city wh\en
the metropolis of the coast is just as convenient for
- l- to be found in the policy of the railroads
of the one place as contrasted with that of the other.
President Hill of the Great Northern is incessantly
busy in building up the country through which his
road passes, and is particularly zealous in promoting
the interests of it- terminal points. He has offered to
. to immigrants, to freight shippers â in short,
to all classes of pcr-ons in the East who wish either
to come West or to ship goods to or from the West â
large inducements to patronize his lines. Any movc
ilculated to build up St. Paul or Puget Sound
ports finds in him a cordial, a prompt and a power
ful suppi â â¢
Very different is the policy pursued by Huntington
_ r ues of the Southern Pacific with refer
ence i" San Francisco. So far from helping to build
up the trade of the city, they lie in wait for it, as a
bandit lie- in wait for a traveler, that they may levy
tribute upon it by extorting from it all the traffic will
1 ear. having no more regard for the welfare of San
cisco than a blackmailer has for the welfare of his
victim.
So extensively have the railway managers of roads
leading t" Puget Sound ports advertised the facilities
of thi that they arc now in some Eastern lo
< alities better known as trading places than San Fran
ii- ( - larked attention has been given to the
.hi trade, and Eastern adventurers eager to try
their fortunes in the gold fields are induced to go to
â¢ Tacoma to outfit instead of coming here.
In that way the trade is taken away from the metropo
lis to cities thai have less facilities for handluig it,
adequate supplies for equipping it and less induce
ments to otter it.
Nothing fan be expected of Mr. Huntington, but
ite and combined efforts the merchant-- of
San ; ran yet succeed in overcoming the
handicap which the Southern Pacific monopoly puts
upon them Now that the fir-t wild excitement and
the exaggerated boom over the Klondike gold dis
ries have passed away, it i^ clearly to be seen the
kan trade i- one of ; ;reat and growing value.
<â  Ins shown that the climate is by no
Â»ean<; so rigorous as was supposed. Quartz mining
igfi) soon take the place of the surface scraping which
it now going on. and the results are certain to be rich
f< r year.- to come. The trade with such a territory
i- not only worth having but worth working for. and.
pite the railway handicap, can be attained if the
Work be undertaken with energy and sagacity.
The Bateman Brothers, who have long since ex
lau ted the patience of the public with their appeals
for delay, have asked the Supervisors for thirty days
more time on the Mall of Justice. What's the matter
with some court giving them the thirty days or more
in the County Jail?
On account of recent reciprocity negotiations it is
believed that the I'nited States and Portugal are get
ting closer to each other. Not nearly so close, how
ever, as they would have been had Spain not drawn
in her horns when she did.
Admiral Schley is said to be ready and eager for
duty. As lie is between the devil and the deep
<^ea now to reconcile the various theories of how he
whipped Cervera, there is little wonder that he would
accept the sea.
Eternal vigilance is no longer the price of liberty.
It is now marked down on the Idaho bargain counter

THE TRANSVAAL IN DANGER.
THE Dutch w<re the civilized pioneers in South
Africa. While scientific societies were proving
or disproving theories about the physiography
of the Dark Continent, and Great Britain and the
United States were raiding the slave coast for captives
to work under the lash in the West Indies and to till
the cane and cotton fields of the South, the Dutch
were penetrating the wholesome uplands, treating the
tribes like human beings and laying the foundation of
the first free state.
Their original plant spread and grew. The Boers i
built homes, reared families and developed civilized
order by being orderly. When England became con
scientious about slavery and concluded to use her
shipping in something else, because Wilberforce had
touched the national heart by denouncing the traffic
in human flesh, and the destruction of life in the hor
rors of the middle passage, as "the sum of all vil
lainies." she discovered that while she had been
making battues of the natives and driving men,
women and children like cattle to the coast where her
sla\e ships lay. tiie plodding Dutch had created in j
peaceful ways, by showing respect for human rights, j
something worth coveting, and she coveted it.
Since then she has pushed north from Cape Town \
until she has crowded the Dutch across the Vaal, and
there the descendants of the people of William the
Silent and John of Barneveldt have made their last
stand. England, meanwhile, has loaned money to.
Egypi and has followed her coupons, shears in hand.
up the Nile to the Soudan. When she looked across
that blear desert she was thrown into an epilepsy of i
horror by finding some Arabs engaged in the slave
trade! In her merchant marine were ships still in
commission that had been loaded below the modern
PHmsoll line with slaves, in the days when she was
willing to turn an honest penny in human chattelry.
Bui when she caught these Mahometan Arabs doing
the same thing it struck her sympathy as severe a
blow as if it had been the first time men were trapped
like animals and sold in the marketplace. Then, be- j
sides that it gave her an excuse for invading the Sou
dan to abolish the slave trade, to get brave Gordon
slaughtered in Khartoum, and then to send
punitive expeditions to suppress false prophets and |
incidentally steal the country.
Having successfully shouldered the "white man's'
burden" in Africa north of the equator, she i-; now
preparing to follow the Dutch across the Vaal. The
Transvaal is an independent state. It has all the in- |
stitutions and muniments of government. It enforces <
order and protects the rights of persons and property
judicially and is equal to all its international obliga
tions. To protect itself it guards and limits the fran
chise. Men of all nations may enter the Transvaal.
but Dutch it was founded and Dutch it shall remain,
if the Boers can have it so. Emigrants, Uitlanders, j
may come and stay and assimilate and become Dutch
and participate in the Dutch franchises. But they
will have none of the benevolent assimilation that has
overrun religion and language in Poland and Finland.
England, having gone among peaceful people from
the Himalayas to Connemara, to soak the soil in
blood, by oppression to produce disorder, and then,
in the name of civilization, to restore order by more
murder and introduce the pax Britannica at the can
non's mouth, is always moved by a desire to inter
fere in vindication of some right. After we whipped
her in our Revolution she insisted upon the old
monarchical doctrine, "once a subject always a sub
ject."' and. denying the right of expatriation, claimed
the privilege of searching our merchant ships at sea
and impressing into her navy all sailors who could
not prove that they were not born subjects of Great
Britain. This was only eighty-seven years ago. She
was then denying the right of the United States to
admit British subjects to citizenship, and our right to
protect them against her after their naturalization.
This republic had existed only twenty-three years. It
was small and weak and might be crushed. So, for j
admitting her subjects to citizenship, she tried to
crush us, but failed.
Observe now her pretext against the Boers. The
Transvaal Republic is to be overrun and destroyed
for refusing to admit British subjects to citizenship,
and a British square is about to carry the pax Bri
tannica across the Vaal.
It is not her first attempt. She tried it before and
was cut to pieces at Majuba Hill. When that disaster
befell her arms an American illustrated paper, which
is devoted to an increase in the gaycty of nations,
published a cartoon illustrating the humiliation of the
great empire by a people few in number but great in
spirit, and ran under it the legend, "Meets a Civilized
Foe at Last."
It was a biting sarcasm, for the last civilized foe
England had met was Russia in the Crimean war.
After that she had occupied her arms in benevolent
assimilation, and in using the blood of the weak to
manure her stolen plantations in the tropics.
If the god of battles give the Dutch another
Majuba Hill we trust that British suzerainty over thi?
country is not so firmly established as to make it
lese majeste to cheer the Boers.
NO IMPERIALISTIC TRUST.
THF. Kreuz-Zeitung, a German paper of great
influence, has claimed that Great Britain de
liberately planned the Samoan incident in order
to excite ill-feeling toward Germany in the United
States and to promote an Anglo-American alliance.
Lloyd ( h borne, a stepson of Robert Louis Stevenson,
long the American Consul at Samoa, one of the
brightest writers of the day. and well known and de
servedly respected in San Francisco, has taken the
German view of the controversy between the two rival
aspirants for the Samoan throne.
Without attempting to indorse these views, there is
much evidence to show that Great Britain seized upon
the war with Spain as an opportunity for the founda
tion of an imperialistic trust, in which the British
empire would he the controlling influence and could
subsidize a nation greater than herself in order to
dominate the world. As a matter of fact, it has been
published that the entire American interests in
Samoa were represented by twenty-six residents. Yet
the conjunction of English and American sailors and
soldiers in opposition to Mataafa has been paraded as
an illustration of fraternity, of the union of the Eng
lish-speaking races, of the mystic spell that blood
spreads in 'lie name of a common origin and a com
mon destiny, until in the exuberance of their Anglo
phobia, the Asiatic expansionists and imperialists have
almost lost the semblance of intelligence.
The schoolboy declamation of some British and
American newspapers over the events at Samoa would
he supremely ridiculous if it were not so mischievous.
Among other things, ecstatic sentimentalism has been
wasted on the proposition that, since the colonial
wars of the eighteenth century, for the first time
American and British sailors and soldiers had fought
together. In this proposition historical accuracy has
been sacrificed to international gush. It is quite true
that, in the bloody wars of the first half of the last
century on this continent, when Great Britain was
struggling with the French and with the Indians,
British regulars and American colonists stood side by
side. But it is also true that they were one nation
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JUNE 24, 1899.
ality, under one flag, and held together by overpower
ing necessity. Beyond tha,t there was little sympathy
between them and the rising thirst of the colonists for
independence, and their increasing irritation at the
exactions and the disregard for their liberties and
for their rights by the British Parliament and by the
British crown were hardly suppressed in the presence
of a common danger.
The cold fact is that in our American civilization
the German element is as important as the British.
?nd that both are held in the embrace of a nationality
that has an individuality of its own. Sentiment is an
excellent flavor for after-dinner speeches, but it is not
a controlling factor in practical government. The
United States is the principal competitor of Great
Britain in the markets of the world. It has furnished
locomotives to the Central Railway in England. It
has invaded both France and Great Britain with its
agricultural machinery. It has proved a successful
rival against British contractors in the Soudan. In
every quarter of the globe its exports are holding
their own with the products of cheap and unintelligent
labor. It has changed trade balances until even the
capitalization of Great Britain has been overcome,
and New York is becoming one of the metropolitan
creditors of the world.
Our national prosperity is not due to imperialism
but to republican institutions, based upon a written
constitution under which personal liberty, property
rights and the representative principle have been held
intact. Our history and our achievements have re
sulted from the overthrow of British power and the
steady growth of American ideas and of American civ
ilization. We have our own precedents to guide us,
and we need no imperialistic trust to conserve our
power or to revolutionize our policy. Friendship
with all nations is and should be the desire of every
patriotic American, but "entangling alliances" are as
repugnant to our interests now as they were in the
days of Washington.
THE FAILURE OF MARTIAL LAW
REPORTS from Idaho to the effect that persons]
brought from the notorious bull pen at Kellogg j
to attend court at Wallace have in some in
stance? obtained exemption from the indignity of :
confinement in jail by paying tribute to the county '
jailer adds the one thing required to complete pub
lic indignation against the methods which have been I
| made use of by the authorities to bring to punishment
the persons guilty of the crimes committed at the out
j break of the miners' strike.
It has been urged in justification of the action of |
the Governor in proclaiming martial law, and of the j
â subsequent action of the military authorities, that a |
; condition of lawlessness prevails in the mining dis- j
I trict around Wardner with which the civil authorities j
are powerless to cope. Even if the charge were true
it would not justify all that has been done there in i
the way of suspending the habeas corpus act, sup- ;
pressing trial by jury and silencing the press. Still
less would it in any way atone for the license per
mitted to the soldiery to insult women, or to the j
seeming immunity of the jailer in levying tribute
upon prisoners committed to his charge.
It must be remembered, however, that there has
been no proof offered to sustain the charge that the
striking miners either abetted the commission of
; crimes or sympathized with ttiosc who committed
them. No class of the American people have been
more earnest or more severe in condemning such
; crimes than the workingmen of the country, and par
ticularly those who stand as representatives of or
ganized labor. There are ample reasons for believing
> that had the civil law been left to take its course the
workingmen of the district would have cordially co
| operated with the authorities in hunting down the
I criminals, in obtaining evidence against them and in
punishing them after conviction.
From all reports that come to us it appears no op
portunity was given the workingmen to show their
respect for law and their abhorrence for crime. As
soon as the outrages were committed, and the}' were
even more injurious to labor than to capital, martial
law was proclaimed, and tho authorities began to
hunt down and harass the workingmeu of the dis
trict as if they were outlaws. Men were arrested by
wholesale and confined in the "bull pen." and an ef
fort made to establish a rigid censorship which would
prevent the proceedings of the authorities being
made known to the public.
Fortunately The Call managed to obtain reports,
some from the Hon. Patrick Reddy and others from
sources equally reliable, all tending to show the ex
cess to which the new development of imperialism
and martial law has been carried. It is in vain, there
fore, that the press of the district has been silenced.
The truth is becoming known, and the more that is
learned of it the more gross appear the offenses com
mitted against American freedom and American law.
The workingmen of the mining district affected by
the strike should have been given a chance to free
themselves from any suspicion of complicity with
cowardly crimes and outrages. That has been the
attitude assumed by workingmen throughout the
country who have taken action on the subject. No
slightest reason exists for believing that the
Miners' Union, or any other union oi American
workingmen either abet crime or sympatlme with it.
and martial law in this country, which leads to the
insulting of women by negro troops or any other
troops, and to extortion by jailers, can find no justi
fication in anything encouraged by American work
ingmen, either .by precept or practice.
The Washington volunteers bagged eighty Filipino
musicians the other day without so much as turning
a hair. The native band \vas so busily engaged in
rehearsing "When Dewey Goes Sailing Home" that
it was not aware of the approach of the Americans
until the demand for surrender sounded.
Dreyfus is on the very eve of his return to France

THE Dewey monument com
mittee met yesterday in the
office of Mayor Phelan. The
members present were well
pleased with the prospect, having
ing been greatly encouraged dur
ing the past week by the news
from various cities throughout the
State to the effect that local com
mittees were being organized and
efforts would be directed at once
to swelling the fund for Califor
nia's artistic testimonial to the
hero of Manila Bay.

letter from John Barrett, â¢ â \-M:m-H
later to Siam, inclosing a check ' ' I
$25 as his subscription to the rnnn-B
ument. In transmitting the â  â 'â â â â  â  .1
Mr. Barrett took occasion to say:M
"I think San Francisco's idea tnH
erect a monument in honor of Ad-M
miral Dewey is one of the best waysÃ
of perpetuating his memory, and lH
am confident that he will appn>-M
ciate such an honor more than theH
raising of any house fund."
With local subscriptions pouring in at the rate of thousands of dollars each week, the members of the com
mittee are confident that as soon as the local committees in the other cities of the State get to work the whole
sum will be subscribed in less than no time.
Mayor Edwin M. Capps of San Diego is heartily in favor of the movement and will at once endeavor to
enlist the aid of the Chamber of Commerce of that city in the cnt)!rprisc.^^HHHHH|^^^^^HH
To the Editor of The Callâ Sir: I am glad the movement to erect a monument to Admiral Dewey is
meeting with such universal favor. I should like to see a monument to this greatest hero of the war in
every city on the coast, but since this cannot be, what better place than San Francisco to erect our tribute
to the commander and statesman? I think it is pretty generally recognized that Admiral Dewey is no
greater naval officer than statesman. It is to the lasting credit of San Francisco that Â§30,000 was raised
in one day toward the cost of the Dewey monument, and any project beginning so auspiciously cannot fail.
The American spirit of the coast people will not let it fail, and I think San Diego will be heard from be
fore the necessary funds are raised. The City Council, of course, cannot take the matter up, but there is no
reason why the Chamber of Commerce of this city cannot assist in the good work. P :blic and lasting
tributes of this character to such heroes as Admiral Dewey are creditable to the nation, a reward to deserv
ing heroes, and an encouragement to the rising generation. The monument must be erected.

His Pride Was Touched,
LAST Sunday two prominent ladies,
residing; at nn? of our downtown
hoptelries. derided to take advan
tage of the splendid day and make
a. trip to the park. After arriving
th^re they wandered around for some
time, finally bringing up in one of the
bypaths, where they paused to admire
some forget-me-nots that were growing
just beside the walk. Coming down the
same path were three soldiers, slightly
under the influence of liquor. The soldiers
continued to advance until they were
within a few yards of where the ladiesâ
who. by the way. are both remarkably
handsome women, though one is old
enough to possess a con some 25 or 2fi
years of ageâ were stooping over the
flowers. Then they halted, and the fol
lowing floated to the ladies' ears as two
of the men remonstrated with the third,
â who was evidently bent on something
which failed to meet with their approval:
"Don't you do it; you'll get yourself in
trouble."
"What's thp difference? I'm going to
have some fun."
"You'd better be careful. They won't
stand for it."
"I don't care; I'm going to take a
chance, anyway."
By this time the two women had become
alarmed, but while one started hurriedly
down the path toward a more frequented
locality the other continued to bend over
the flowers, though one of the men. de
taching himself from the others, advanced
until he stood directly behind her.
Then the lady, smiling at him over her
shoulder, said:
"How do you do?"
"I'm well," gruffly responded the fellow,
who was surprised at not having to make
the first advances himself.
"I always speak to a man wearing that
uniform."' sweetly continued the lady,
"because I know it always covers a man
and because I have a son in the army
myself."
"Who's he with?" inquired the man.
"He's with the Fourth Cavalry in the
Philippines," responded the woman. "Oh,
isn't that a beautiful rose over there?"
â¢'l'll get it for you." said the man.
"No, don't; you'll be arrested."
"I'll take the chance." And, vaulting
over the wire netting, he plucked the
flower, handed it to the lady and, raising
his hat with perfect respect and polite-

ness, left and joined his comrades.
Some little time after the two ladies
started to take a Hayes-street car home,
arriving at the car just as the three sol
diers were about to enter it. The latter
politely stepped aside to allow the ladies
to get aboard, and then, raising their
hats, started to take seats on thf dummy.
As they were moving off the ladies heard
one of his companions ask the would-be
masher who they were.
"I don't know." was the answer; "but
one of them is a soldier's mother, and.
Bay boys, I'm well ashamed of my
self."

"RICHELIEU"
ANALIZED AT
THE ALCAZAR
"The King must have no mistress but
the stateâ the state, that's Richellau."
This conviction and the errors of his ad
versaries, which are often more profita
ble to us than our finest strategy, were
the foundations upon which the wily, far
seeing, plotting, revengeful but masterful
Cardinal recreated France and made her
a power among nations.
The rise of the curtain at the Alcazar
reveals a pretty stage picture wherein the
clever pantomime of one woman, the cen- !
tral figure, and the dialogue of half a
dozen men acquaint us quickly with the
principal virtues and vices of the century â 
and make the need of a Richelieu pain- i
fully apparent. Poor, empty, worthless
creatures, most of them,- disguised in the
trappings of wealth and rank till th'->y
really imagine themselves great peep's
Lives rotten to the core in sin and pollu
tion set in high places and imagining
themselves other than common clay
Probably no hotter exponent of the great i
character could be found than L. -.vis !
Morrison, who adds to great intelligence
years of study and devotion to a profes- I
sion made honorable and educational
through just such efforts as his in !

Julie de Mortemar, as played by Miss

onic ability, is so winsome and lovable
that we are sure it is not alone appreci

Town Talk.
A three-page opinion tiled a few days
ago in the Supreme Court fa made the
text of some interesting paragraphs from
the Court Reporter's pen in Town Talk
this week, and the too common custom of
putting- the worst possible construction
upon words and phrases is treated from a
legal standpoint. One of Justice Oaroutte's
characteristic stories enlivens the
World of T,aw. There are some- editor'ais
in this issue that will set church people
to thinking, and the Baunterer giv^-s sev
eral exclusive stories about people we
know in society and at the clubs. The
custom of marrying for money serve? us
a subject for a satirical sermon. Irene
Connell has a translation of one oi
"Gyp'B" Parisian society sketches, and
Alfred Metzger and Mary Francis write
entertainingly in the musical depart
ment. The Japanese players and people
who laugh at what they do not under
stand In a play are among subjects
treated in the dramatic department, r.o:-;?

CLERKS CANNOT
BE APPOINTED
BY THE JUDGES
Effects of Supreme
Court Decision.
SEVERAL OFFICES CRIPPLED
â #__
COUNTY CLERK NOT THE ONLY
ONE TO SUFFER.
Strong Efforts to Be Made to Secure
a Modification of the Rul
ing Payment of
Deputies.
Thprf are several municipal officers, in
cluding the District Attorney, Superin
tendent of Streets and License Collector,
who have discovered that they are in the
same boat with the County Clerk, Hn.l
that their office forces have been greatly
curtailed by the recent decisions of the
Supreme Court. None of them have yet
decided upon any plan of action, but tl.ev
are hopinp that a rehearing will be grant
ed, and some modification of the original
decision made. They all declare that th
business of thei rreapective offices ha? In
creased to such an extent that it will be
utterly impossible to properly transact
business with the force provided for by
the law ' of twenty yean ago. All the
offices affected will confer shortly rtnd
reach some agreement as to what course
to pursue to secure a modification of tht
decision.
County Clerk Deane returned from !
Tuscan Springs yesterday morning, and
was met at the depot by Managing Dep
uty Joseph Goddard. Mr. Deane and Mr.
Goddard held a brief consultation .and !
then parted. Later in the day Mr. Deans
called upon Auditor Wells and an agree
ment was reached between them as to
the course which will be pursued under
the decision of the Supreme Court.
"Auditor Wells has agreed to audit the
demands of the deputies in my office up
to the time the remittitur arrives from
the Supreme Court." said Mr. Dean
"The remittitur will not arrive, in o'l ;
probability, until about thirty days. ;md
in the meantime a plan of action can h"
p ( rl â¢ ted. If this decision is final, all T
can do is 10 live up to the law and cut
down the staff under me. in keeping with
the decision. It Will work no hardship
upon m< . the public alone must Buffer it
the work in the office drags, but I can as
sure the people that I will do my best to
keep matters tunning with the limited
force allowed me by law.
"However. I hardly think the decision
will stand as it is now. There has been
â  some talk that the Superior Judges had
authority to appoint such officers as may
be necessary to conduct the business of
their respective departments, but I am
i informed on the best legal authority that j
thej have no power to appoint clerks, and
the Supreme Court decision only provides
[ght courtroom clerks, while there
arÂ« twelve departments. The Superioi
Judges will not submit to this, nor will
the Bar Association. Of course there will i
be an application for a rehearing, and I
rather think that some sort of conference â 
will be held, at which a compromise wi.i !
ibe effected and the decision modified
whereby the County Clerk will be given a
sufficient force to conduct his office with,- !
out interfering with the proper adminis
tration of justice. i
"This decision sets the ( ounty < lerk s
offie â  hack to its condition when the new
constitution went into effect in 1879. A 1
that time therp were only eight depart
ments of the Superior Court and the bus
of the office was nÂ»t to be compared
Â°Miditor Wells said: "I shall honor
: these dermnds the same as heretofore. :
i until the remittitur is handed down. The ,
i clerks and Judges can by that time de- j
i termine what they shall do. T.he law
under which these clerks are employed
< went into effect in lSgn, when San Fran
' Cisco was but a village. I believe at that
time the Auditor and one clerk carried j
on the business of this office. The city j
1 has grown in size since then, however, [
i and personally I do not believe that the
County Clerk has any more clerks than;
! were needed to carry on the work of his I
department. With only twenty-seven I
clerks it will be impossible to do the |
! work. T suppose the courts will order ex- i
tra help and send special court orders for \
! the salaries of the clerks. These I am
I compelled to audit. Except for making
more work for this office. I do not be
lieve the decision of the Supreme Court
will make much difference. We will have,
: to keep two accounts, one for court or
â  ders and the other for the clerks em
ployed by the County Clerk. The remit
titur will probably not be handed down
for about thirty days."
Auditor Wells and County Clerk Deane
do not agree upon one point, for while
the Auditor is of the opinion that the
courts can appoint clerks, the County
Clerk says he has high legal authority
to tlie contrary. The Superior Judges are
expected to take some action in the mat
ter Monday, for one and all declare they
| cannot hold court without a clerk.
RULES ARE FORMULATED.
For the Guidance of the Local Pas
senger Agents' New Association.
The committee of seven appointed to
draft rules and by-laws for the govern
ment of the new Local Transcontinental
Passenger Agents' Association met in the
Southern Pacific building yesterday after
noon and formulated a set of laws which
will be presented to the association for
its acceptance or rejection at its next
nioetinp. which will be held on Tuesday
morning in Wells. Fargo & Co.'s building
on Second and Mission streets.
Major Field Incompetent.
Major Edward Field, an officer at pres
ent located at the Presidio, has been sent
to a local institution for treatment, as ho
is unable to transact business. Yesterday
Judge Troutt appointed his wife Mrs
Minna Field, his guardian, fixing her
bonds at $1000. She will serve until fuch
time as the unfortunate officer has been
restored to mental capacity.

Saturday last saw a great crowd In at
tendance^ md it remained for the bulldog
Searchlight to turn oft til- sensational
performance of the week. In the third
heat of the 2:05 pace the distance flag by
consent of the Judges | was waived, and
Myron Mcllenry announced that he would
Bend the star of the Keating stake a last
mile. Stepping to the quarter in :32 flat,

quarters in 1:.Â°.4-4. and the mile finished out
in I'lOo'i. making the fastest mile trawled
by a harness horse thus uir this year.
After the heat McHenry said he was
positive Searchlight would return to Cal
ifornia next fall with a mark below 2:02.
In this name race Raymond W. the i>ig
black horse owned by Kd Oaylord. showed
i.) much advantage and will prove a hard
one to beat In his class "down the line."
Raymond \V was driven by James Cas
pldy; certainly a wonder in his line. In
c-arlier life an accident deprived CaSsldy
of his right arm anil leg. With the aid f.f
:m artificial limb he sits In the bik**., and
passing â â }Ââ¢ reins around his shoulders
drives with the air of .a veteran. He piles
â¢ the whip in an artistic manner, and if
jits horse happens to make a "jimmy ' he
can pick him up as quickly as a whole
man.
A feeling of gloom prevails around the
Keating stable, for whole-souled Tom y
Keating, who developed the. two pacing
stars Anaconda and Searchlight, will
probably J never again hold the ribbons
over his two pets. Soon after arriving in
Denver Keating was taken ill, being con
lined to his room at the home of Kd Gay
lord. For a time his condition was eriti
Â«:tl in the extreme, but during the past
week he rallied slightly and on Wednes
day departed for Mount Clemens, Mich.,
accompanied by Lew Crellin and wife of
Pleasanton; Cal. The latter gentleman Is
part owner of Searchlight. The local
physicians think that possibly Mr. Keat
ing's health may improve in a lower alti
tude.
The muchly touted pacer Coney started
in the 2:48 class event. on .Thursday last,
ruling an odds-on favorite. The black
fellow won in straight beats, 'taking a
mark of 2:14 Horsemen in general,

he will not prove so much when tossed
among the grand circuitors. Tom Keat

even more successful than that if last

at work and will have the courses cor

be given In the name of the Pacific North

finally considered, will be held next
Thursday evening at s o'clock at room
E62, Parrott JbuUdlng. The Olympic
Wheelmen will then present their side of
the case for the defense, and the dele
gatee will vote on the matter. One thing
Is certain, and that is. the race will not be
'â  run over this year. The trouble and ex
pense is too great. Ti>. delegates might
vote, however, to call this year"s event no
race. All fair-minded wheelmen are of
I the opinion, nevertheless, that the Olym

been won. and that they are justly en
titled to the trophy.

the cranks will have to wait a few days
more before they can ascertain just where
their favorites stand. Jt Is a very pretty
fight among the leaders, and some sur

GERALDINE, THE FAMOUS
SPRINTER NOW RETIRED
A Q\jeer\ of the Jvjrf ar\d Her Offspring.
The Call presents to-day the third of its series of celebrated matrons of th<Â»
turf. Geraldlne and her sturdy young colt by W. 08. Macdonough's horse St.
Carlo. "Jerry," as the great mare was invariably called by her admirers, was
possibly the greatest sprinter on the American turf. Her half-mile record of 4<J
seconds, made at YVestchester. X. V., August 30. ISS9, with 122 pounds up, has
never been equaled. She also ran six and a half furlongs on old Bay DMtiict
track in IS9I in 1:18%, as against the present American record of 1:192-6 by VVern
berg.
She has been raced in many classic events, match races and even at count}'
fairs, hut whatever the race, whatever the pace, whatever the distance, she has
finished, with but few exceptions, tirst. Her ancestors on her dam's side have
been owned by the family of R. Porter Ashe for a number of generations back. His
m:ire Cousin Peggy, mated with E. J. Baldwin's great horse Grlnstead, produced
Geraldine. now 14 years old. Geraldine was a great favorite with the feminine
frequenters of racetracks, invariably carrying their money in all her starts. The
mar.- seldom disappointed them.
There was much of romance in her honorable career on the turf. Possib!y the
crowning episode was the visit of Porter Ashe and his brothers to Bay District
track and the subsequent abduction of the mare, which had passed out of their
hands and for which he and his brothers have always shown so much affection.
Sydney Ashe saddled Geraldine and horse and man were soon swallowed up in
the darkness. Months afterward she was found at the ranch of "Jack" Reos
near Pleasanton.
Geraldine is owned by A. B. Spreckels and is one of the group of celebrated '
matrons on his farm near Napa. The colt foal by her side is by St. Carlo, he by
St. Blaise, winner of the Derby, and afterward sold to August Belmont of New
York for $K>o.ooo. Ruinart, winner of the Burns handicap. Palace Hotel stakes
and other classic events, la also by St. Carlo, out of a sister to Geraldine.
I ternoon. Ewing has secured a new first |
! baseman named Magulre, who is reputed |
ito be a good one and a hard hitter. He
has accepted the hint to try Russell
against the big fellows who annihilate
right-handers but get into difficulty when
ever they face a southpaw. Donlln will
make his last appearance on the Califor
nia diamond this season, for next week i
he starts East to fill his engagement with
St. Louis. He will be in the box to-day
for the visitors. The Oaklands have been
practicing assiduously every day this
week, both in fielding and batting, and are
confident they will more, than hold their
own; The game will be called at 3 o'clock

SILVER CUP FOR
WOMEN GOLFERS
The Prince Poniatowski Challenge
Trophy Gives the Game
Renewed Life.
So many people have already left the
city 1 hat the Presidio links are compara
tively deserted. The following ladles

lately: Miss Moody, Miss Dobeer, Mrs.
H. B. Goodwin, Miss M. B. Houghton.
Miss Benjamin and Miss Sarah Drum.
Among the men who have been over the

greens, or his representative, immediately
after completing the course. The cup will
be awarded to the lady making the lowest
gross score for the two rounds.
More activity is at present being dis
played by the golfers of San Rafael than
by those of Oakland or San Francisco.
For some time to come San Rafael and
Del Monte will be the favorite rendezvous
of golf lovers. J. Melville, formerly of
the Oakland Golf Club, is in charge of
the Del Monte links. Several matches In
response to challenges have recently been
played among the members of the San
Rafael Golf Club. Over the short course:
Mrs. \V. C. Uush defeated Mrs. A. F. Kech

Santa Monica is becoming a favorite re
sort of golfers. There are two linksâ
thi se of the Santa Monica Golf Club ami
the Ocean Park course. The latter was
lain out last year by Messrs. Dudley and
Kinnev and is being put into order for
the season. It is a sporty course, and
was popular last year. It Is intended to
keep the greens in good order through
out this season, which was formaliv
opened yesterday by an open tournament
which will be concluded to-day
Besides the Ocean Park links 'th^-re are
also at Santa Monica the grounds and
house of thf> Santa Monica Golf Club The
instructor is W. Robertson, who has' been
a golfer from boyhood. ha*ing been born
at Carnoustie. which lies across the river
from the famous Scotch links of St \n
drews. For two years he was with "the
Burlingame Country Club, which disputes
with Riverside the honor of having first
made golf known in California. He also
laid out the course at the Hotel del
Monte. Monterey, and was for mor? than
three years the couch of the San Fran
cisco Golf Club. The grounds of the ,-5-iiitA
Monica Golf Club of the North Side lie
between Eighth and Fourteenth streets
and Arizona and California avenues The
"greens"' are not turfed, but are made of
layers of adobe soil and ocean b*>ach
sand, packed and rolled until it is as hard
and smooth as an oaken floor. The lead
ing spirits In the club are Robert Jones
Roy Jones, G. W. Wells. M. J. Burnieste l
and T. 11. Dudley, the last two being well
known cricketers.
Golf is played almost all over Southern
California. Among the now clubs is the
Sar. Buenaventura Golf Club, which was
organized in December of last year The
members, few of whom have ever niayed
golf before, are at present using tem
porary links, as no suitable ground for a
course is available. There is a good
deal of enthusiasm among them. Dr
Hemming is president. Mrs. J. S. Nt'wby
treasurer and Miss Jane Herrlck secre

FISHERMEN FIND SPORT
IN THE YOSEMITE LAKES
Reservation Waters Teen) With All Varieties of Trout.
Movements of Weil-Known Rod-Wielders
on Many Streams.
President Alexander T. Vogelsang of
the State Fish Commission returned some
days since from Yosemite National Park
and is enthusiastic over the magnificence
01 the valley and the attractions it of
fers fishermen. Although the season is
backward, because of the high stage of
the water, tht sport has not suffered.
When the water runs dov i the fishing
should be as good as any to be had In
the mountains.
In four hours' fishing: down stream at
Wanona Mr. Vogelsang secured forty-one
trout. They were not of large size, aver
aging from six to ten inches, but they
were fine, fat fish. Farther down the
Merced River Mr. Vogelsang thinks the
sport would, if anything, inprove. He
met a man with a basket filled to the top,
some of his fish being twelve-inch ones.
Ostrander, Johnson and Grouse Lakes
have been well stocked and are full of
fish. Alder Creek, through the Empire
Meadows, is stocked with Eastern brook
trout. Bridal Veil Falls provides good
fishing and can be reached from Glacier
Point or Wawona hotels. The south fork
of Merced River is fairly teeming with
fish at Wawona and, in fact, throughout
the reservation the same holds good.
To Mr. Vogelsang's surprise he found
not one in fifty of the persons entering
the valley were provided with fishing im
pedimenta. The valley is full of campers,
while the hotels have all the patronage
they could desire.
Al Coombs and wife left on the 20th
inst. for Grants Pass, Oregon. They will
fish the Rogue River until July 1, and
will then goto Pelican Bay. where they
will remain until August IS The stage

RIFLEMEN MAY SECEDE.
After nearly a year of waiting the local |
representatives of the National Schuet- )
zenbund have received a report of the
finances of that organization when the
final settlement of affairs of the last
tournament at Glendale. Long Island. -V.
V.. was made. The riflemen here regard
the report as a case of "Old Mother Hub
bard." so far any benefits they are to
receive are concerned. In the past the
custom has been and the bund laws re
quire that within thirty days from the j
conclusion of each national rifle tourna
ment the officers shall make a complete
report to the member clubs and as quickly
as possible turn over to the new board of j
officers, in whatever part of the United |
States they may be. all funds, property
and archives. When it was decided to
hold the next tournament in San Fran
cisco in 1901 the knowing ones here re
marked that the New Yorkers would
figure out the finances so neatly that no
good Eastern money would be sent to the
Pacific Coast. How wisely they judged |
may be seen from the following synopsis
Of the old officers' report:
The rash left over after the tournament of
1895 amounted to $6206 93, with $j94 06 for in
terest This, with the receipts of the last
tournament for shooting tickets and conces
sions amounted to $2T.ril6 06. The disburse
ments amounted to the astonishing sum of
$Â°7 131 20, leaving a balance of $381 88. The hal
ance was further reduced by a lawsuit "for i
services" by one of the executive board, which I
rut the true balance to $2MÂ» 86. This, with a j
few cheap medals and cups, will be all that
will rome to the new organization. Some of
the principal items of expenditures are peculiar.
The shooting committee spent $16,770 61 in
prizes, while the sale of tickets for shooting
ran up over $20,000. Thp entertainment and
park committee took $42. r >B "0 out of the fund,
while the expenses of the press committee was I
$2*il9 61. Two cheap ai-robats, for thp amuse- â 
menr of quests, cost $1050; music. $1200, and
"entertainment." $260. The account of mis
cellaneous expenses was $3452 27.
This treatment at the hands of the I
Eastern riflemen has developed a matin- |
ous sentiment In the ranks of the local |
marksmen. From twelve to fifteen rifle â 
clubs in this city, Sacramento and San j
Jose are members of the Naional Schuer- I
zenbund, and among them the question !
is being asked. "Why should the members !
of the Pacific Coast support an organize- ,
tion whose Eastern officers have done
such clever financiering that the Western j
members are deprived of the privilege of !
handling any of the funds?" As a fact,
in the past tournaments in the East the
Western riflemen have "shot in" be
tween $3500 and $4000. yet only a little over
$200 comes back to this coast for the
benefit of the national tournament. That
there has been gross mismanagement, i.r j
worse, is the general opinion here. It j
would not be surprising if, out of this un
satisfactory condition of affairs, a West
ern rifle shooting association should
spring. The argument made is that if the
tournament of 1901 proves a financial suc
cess, and the events of Western riflemen â¢
are always successes, the Western marks
men should have the benefit, instead of
sending a surplus to the East to he
squandered. On Monday night the dele
gates to the bund will meet, and some
action on this suggestion may be taken.

SAPLINGS WILL
BE TRIED OUT
Mettle of Some New Stock Will
Be Tested in Competition
To-Day.
The saplings will have their inning at
Union Coursing Park to-day, there being
two stakes â one for dogs and the other
for bitches â on the card. A lot of new
stock will be riven a trial, affording tho
followers of the game a line on their pos
sibilities as future winners of big stakes.
<'hlef interest centers about the Kmin Pa
shaâVan Cloe youngsters, entered by Rob
ert Malcom and J. H. Rosseter. They art
bred for speed and are expected to render
a good account of themselves.
The owners of some of the dogs hava
ignored all precedent and to secure pup
pies have bred non-winners to non-win
ners. Authorities hold that the chances
of getting a stake winner under these
conditions are remote. It shows an abid
ing faith in their dogs when men will
go to all the expense of raising and car
ing for them under these circumstances.
The sires and dams of some of them are
hardly eligible for a beaten dog stake.
The sires whose progeny prove winners
have invariably shown ability at some
time in their career. It is an adage
among horsemen to breed winners to win
ners and this should hold equally good
among the greyhounds, where extreme
speed is desired.
The ciehtv-four-dog stake, which will
be run down once to-day, has been filled
with a high-class lot of dogs. Many for
mer winners of stakes which have" been
in retirement for a long time are being
brought out and are ready to battle for
the prizes.
The directors of Union Park are already
preparing for the next big event, the
Winners" stake, to be decided about the
middle of July. To secure a high stand
ard it has been determined to restrict
eiitries to dogs which have won a first
or a second prize. An entrance fee of $10
will be exacted. The association will give
$1000 added money.
There will he coursing on the Ist, 2d
and 4th of July. The programme Includes
an open stake, limited to eighty entries,
and a forty-eight-dog reserve stake for
non-winners. All dogs which have run
to third money since January 1 are ex
cluded. This does not include the win
ners of extra? or sapling stakes
After the 30th inst. the passes now is

NEW YORK. June 23.â Joseph Wal

don, th" Australian midille-wetKht. at
i the end of a hard-fought twenty-round
, bout before the New Broadway Ath
letic Club to-night. "Johnny" White
was th^ referee.
In the opening round Creedon led a
, straight left, landing on the head, and
j sent his left back to the body. Walcott
: hooked his left to the chin. A ri^ht from
Walcott put Dan's eye in mourning be
fore the bell rang.
Walcott opened the second with a left
' hook to the eye. Dan shooting his right
to the body, following with a short left
to the face. Walcott sent a left hook to
the jaw and a risrht to the body, keep
ing Dan moving around the rins".
Waicott canit- out strong in the third
: and drove his left straight to the
mouth, but was blocked cleverly when
jhe tried his right for the body. Wal
; cott kept pummeling his opponent rap
j idly, receiving occasional counters
which did not seem to have any effect
upon him.
Jn the sixth r>>und a left smash from
Wa'.t tt sent the blood spurting from,
lon's right eye, and after Dan re
ceived a right and left on the body he
lookei very tired. He came up i:; the
next rounÂ«l If -king strong, having evi
dently fully recuperated. Walcott sert
a succession of left jabs to Dan s face,
I much to Creedon's discomfiture, and
I from this round to the finish Walcott
had it all his own way.
Dan made a wonderful rally in the
fifteenth, sending his right over three
times t'i the negro's head. In the sev-
I enteenth Walcott slipped to his knee
:in a rush. Walcott was on his feet in
j a second, however, and both men
1 laughed.
The nineteenth round found Walcott
forcing Dan all over thn ring with
lefts to the body and rights to the
i head. Dan fought back desperately,
j but hi? blows lacked steam. When
' they shook hands for the wind-up Wal
cott rushed and tried hard to land a
decisive blow, but Creedon managed to
â¢'. Ide him cleverly. When the gong
ended the bom the negro turned and
shook hands with Creedon and Lavigne.
Referee White gave the decision to
Walcott.

"DOC" PAYNE KNOCKS
OUT PATSY CORRIGAN
San Franciscan Beaten in a Mill Re-
markable Only for Foul
Fighting.
DENVER, June 23.â At the Denver
Wheel Club to-night "Dor" Payne, who
hails from Cleveland, Ohio, and is the
sparring partner of "KM" McCoy, put out
Patsy Corrigan of San Francisco in the
sixth round of what was scheduled to
have be< n a twenty-round fight. It was
a slugging match throughout and was de
void of anything approaching science.
Corrigan adopted rushing tactics from the
start! am', in the ' >M ; siiins between the
men frequently both fell to the flour. In
the fourth round Payne threw Corrigan
through the rop<'s.
Payne was somewhat unruly when cau
tioned by the referee against striking his
opponent low and hitting in the clinches,
which he -lid frequently, and during the
second round would have struck Corri
gan while the latter lay prostrate on the
mat had not the referee wrestled with
him and pulled him away. In the third
round Payne fought the referee, who
tried in vain to separate the fighters.
"Jack" Grace acted as referee. "Kid"
Mi '".>>â¢ sat back of Payne and coached
him between the rounds.
"Tommy" White sparred J. McNearney,
the New York newsboy, four exhibition
rounds in the preliminaries, which was
followed with a four-round go between
"Danny" McFadden of San Francisco and
"Young Ccrhett." feather-weight cham
pion of Colorado. "Young Corbett" had
trn pounds the better of it In weight, hut
McFadden made it interesting for him,
nevertheless, and in the opinion of the
spectators had decidedly the better of the
last round, landing on Corbetfa face and
body with ease. This bout was scientific
and rapid and prepared the crowd for the
disappointment they were to receive from
the character of the main event.
Leon and Forbes Draw.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., June 23.â The battle,
to-night for the so-called bantam-weight
championship of the world, between Cas

vantage.

SLOSH TO RIDE
TO THE END OF
THE SEASON
False Rumors of His
Retirement.
TALKS OF ASCOT INCIDENT
WAITER WAS DETERMINED TO
CAUSE TROUBLE.
Deliberately Upset the Table at Which
the Jockey Sat and Was
Knocked Down for His
Pains.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, â  1899, by James Gor
don Bennett.
LONDON, June 23.â For the last two or
three days report has been going about
in sporting circles to the effect that Tod
Sloan had decided to give up racing on
this side for the remainder of the season.
The reason given was that it was due to
the row with a waiter at Ascot.
A Herald correspondent saw the Ameri
can jockey to-day. lie said there was" no
truth whatever in the story, and that he
intended to carry out all his racing en
gagements. He then gave his version of
the entire affair, which differs materially
freni most of the stories printed.
"After the last race at Ascot on Cup
day, while 1 was waiting for a friend to
accompany me home, another friend and
1 took a Beat at a ta.ble on the lawn and 4
ordered a small botue of champagne.
"i had not been feeling very well, and
thought that the wine would do me good.
It was absolutely the first drink of wine
or spirits that I had taken In more than
a week. The waiter who served the drink
after leaving the table went and spoke to
another waiter, a man named Winter
born, who was serving the tables near
ours. This man made some remarks
about an American jockey, to which we
paid no attention. To serve his tables he
should have followed the path which ran
back of our table. Instead of that the
next time he passed he crowded in front
of our table and bumped' against us.
"1 grabbed hold of him, but said noth
ing. He then in a few minutes returned
and again bumped into our table. Tnis
time I told him to take care. He mut
tered something and went off a third time.
"As he approached again I said to my
friend, 'This man intends to upset our
v table.' Sure enough, as he got in front
of us he suddenly turned around, placinf
his back to us, and before we could catch
the table he bad upset it and the contents
on our laps. I seized a bottle as it fell
and in the' anger of the moment struck
the man back-handed. The bottle hit him
in the face, but the blow was not at all
severe, and I was surprised to see blood
flow. The bottle was not broken.
"A friend of mine, who afterward saw
Winterborn, found him sitting up in bed
and apparently very little the worse for
the blow, notwithstanding all stories that
have been printed about his being in a
serious condition."
FITZSIMMONS SAYS
HE WILL FIGHT AGAIN
Ex-Champion to Meet "Kid" McCoy
for the Middleweight
Championship.
NEW YORK, June 23.â Ex-Champion |
"Bob" Fitzsimmons says he will soon
fight again. In all likelihood his next !
opponent will be "Kid" McCoy. Dur
ing the past few days several offers
have been made by different clubs for
the match, the Colorado Athletic Club
being the principal bidder, with a purse j
of $20,000. Martin Julian is not inclined j
to go so far West, for he thinks the j
Coney Island Club will give more money I
than the Denver organization is ready !
to 'lunate. Fitzsimmuns Fays he would '
rather box in the East, as he is anxious
to give the sports who lost money on
him when he fought Jeffries a chance
to get even. Julian said to-night:
"Arrangements are under way to
bring about a fight between McCoy and
Fitzsimmons to decide the middle
weight championship. I have received
assurances from the Coney Island
Sporting Club that that organization :
will go as high as any other club and j
the chances are that the mill will b>Â»
settled there some time in September." :
McCoy is now in Denver and has
been communicated with. He says he
is ready to fight "Lanky Bob" and will â¢
tackle him after his battle with Joe j
Choynski, which is to be pulled off in
; Denver on July 2S.
Julian said under no circumstances
would Fiizsimmons agree to meet Tom
Sharkey at the Lenox Athletic Club or
anywhere else. He declares both the \
saih>r and his manager have "roasted" ;
Fitzsimmons all over the country, and ;
that Fitzsimmons will not give them a
chance to make money at his expense.
Fitzsimmons will make his first ap
pearance in the ring since his defeat by
: Jeffries at the Coney Island Club on
next Monday night. He will spar four
I rounds with "Yank" Kenny previous
to the twenty-five-round go between
"Mysterious Billy" Smith and Charlie
McKeever.
ON THE TENNIS COURTS.
The California Tennis Club was the
scene of some good tennis during the
week. ' For the first time in many months
the Whitneys and the Hardys met on op
posite sides of the net. George Whitney,
the best that the local club can offer, and
Sunnier Hardy, the present coast cham
pion, played singles. Whitney literally
dragged Hardy over the ground. The first
set was 6-0 in Whitney's favor. When the
second set reached the stage of 3-0 in fa
vor of the local crack the men called it
off, and the Whitney brothers and the
Hardys then played doubles. The Oak
landers were the victors in this march,
score 6-4, 6-4.
An English player with a reputation
strolled on to the courts during the week.
When he gave the i.ame of Lawford the
local men were ready to fall at his feet
He Is not the great Lawford, however,
merely a cousin. George Whitney was se
lected to meet this visiting expert. One
set satisfied the California Club men that
Whitney is â  superloi man with the
racket," for he defeated the Englishman
i:: a six love game. â¢
Miss E. Chesebrough beat Miss R. Fos
ter, 1-8, 7-5, M. Mlswes Clark. Hall and
Foster were at San KaraH during the
week and played a round robin there, di
viding the honors.
When the Pacific States Lawn Ten
nis Association first announced the
championship tournament in singles,
which will be played on the San
Rafael courts on July 1. a large
number of players came forward
and signified their intention to enter the
lists. Since that time there Ikis been a
change in the condition of things, which,
unless they are remedied during the com
ing week, will produce a tournament in
which there will be but few entries and
uninteresting contests.
The full list to date, and that covers
about all who will piay. is as follows:
Alamedaâ Murdock and. Hunt: California
âHarry Weih. Grant Smith. George B:ad-
Bhaw, Dr. Root, Barclay Henley, MÂ«rle
Johnson. J. M. Cote; Oaklandâ Snm
Hardy. Earl Stone. Paul Selby. Dibcrt
and Brown; Dr. Phillip:; ofÃcno will be a
party in the tournament as 1n former
years. George Whitney is as yet unde
cided whether he will play or not. If the
proper persuasion is brought to bear
Whitney will enter and contest Sam Har
dy's right to the championship. The win
ner of the all-comers will have to meet
Sumner Hardy, the present champion, If
George Whitney does not enter the cup
will go to the Hardy family for a cer
tainty.

battle resulting from a clash of creeds
among the Indians at Port Essington
was received here to-night by the
steamer Princess Louise. That vessel
passed Essington on Saturday night,
and just at that time the light took
j place. A hnlf dozt-n Indians were in
jured, though nut very seriously.
Over 1000 Indians have lately been
encamped ne;:r P^rt Essington. They
I were salmon fishing at the opening of
the season, but went on a strike. The
Salvation Army thought them fit sub
jects for revival services and started
; in with some gospel meetings on the
hill buck >>f the village. Then a Metho
dist minister, realizing what chances
were being lost, started a camp meet
: ing and with the aid of the Eniscopal
; ian clergyman, who took the opposite
| hill, they made quite a mountain of
I song.
Last Saturday the fever of religious
fervor was burning at its highest, and,
as the steamer hove into sight, the In
; dians all decided to show to their white
j friends the results of their awakening.
1 They started for the wharf by trails
j that converged at one point.
The Indians met above th^ wharf,
v . !; re the trail was so narrow as hardly
to let one party pass at a time. A mix
!up followed, and although no worse
: weapons than fists and cluhs were used
i some of the reds were badly cut up.
; r:;."-d flowed freely and thp injured Tn
i dians came down to the steamer for
I medicine. The fighters were finally
| separated by the missionaries, who
: were the most surprised of all at what
! had occurred.
MISER SEEKS HOME
AT A COUNTY HOSPITAL
Search of His Clothing Reveals the
Existence of a Bank Account
in His Name.
SAX ANDREAS, June 23.â Prosper
Blanchard, an old resident of Brandy
Flat, was admitted to the county hospital
on April 3 of this yeat\ Blanchard is 72
years of age and when admitted was. a
dirty, shabbily dressed creature. Super
intendent Burgess, having: heard rumors
to the effect that hi.- pauper had consid
erable money in the bank, concluded it
was his duty to Investigate.
Yesterday morning Burgess instructed
the nurse to give Blanchard a bath and
report tÂ«' him when the man was in the
water. The Instructions were carried out,
and the superintendent entered the room,
ostensibly to see if the patient needed
anything in the way of clothing. Burgess
says that after looking the man's clothes
over he concluded that if the old chap
needed anything he could buy it himself.
The clothes contained $20 2.". in cash and a
statement rendered by the French Sav
i ings and Loan Society, showing a bal
i ance due Blanchard on May 2, 1*99. of
(846 43.
In compliance with the rules and regu
lations of the county hospital Burgess
1 kept $20 for the county, giving the miser
the remaining 25 cents in coin. The rules
do not allow the superintendent to con
fiscate all the money a patient may have
on his person. He has a copy of the bank
1 statement filed away for any future use.
Blanchard was discharged immediat3ly
and is probably preaching poverty among
his neighbors.

SUCCESS.
Advice to Men Who Are Ambitious to Succeed
in BusinesS ; Po 'itcs, War or
Social Life.
THE MAIN TRAVELED ROAD CLEARLY INDICATED,
The road to success is a difficult one
to travel. While a few hundred men,
comparatively speaking, tread triumph-
antly this mui'h-.s ught thoroughfare
its entire length, thousands only get
fairly started; millions never find it.
To reach the end of this highway one
should be well prepared for the jour-
ney. An average allowance of intellect,
sometimes known as "horse sense," is,
of course, necessary. Favorable cir-
â  umstances also lend valuable' assist-
ance, while courage is indispensable.
This latter, however, is seldom pos-
sessed without health and strength.
Vast armies of men annually fall by
the wayside because they are tortured
and worried by weakness or disease.
Such men can ever iind true and
valuable friends at the well-known and
reliable medical institution of Dr.
Meyers & Co. Reader, this may appeal
to you. Do not let Nervous Debility,
with all its attending horrors, dangers
and embarrassments get the u;>pÂ«^r
hand. If your vital power is waning
or gone, if you have unnatural losses,
drains, etc.. confusion of id^as, pain in
the back, palpitation of the heart; or if
you are troubled with absent-minded,
ness, loss of flesh, poor appetite, sleep-
lessness, drowsiness after meals, bash-
fnlness, dizziness and any other symp-
toms of which victims of indiscretions,
excesses, overwork, worry, etc., are
well aware, you should heed suth warn-
ings. They are Nature's cry for medi-
cal assistance and will nut permit of
delay. Â«Men who defy fate must suffer
the disastrous consequences which are
sure to follow. Dr. Meyers & Co. mas-
ter these troubles quickly and perma-

EASTERN MARKETS.
TORK STOCK MAB
NEW YORK, June 23.â The market did not
extend beyond professional bounds at any time
to-,]ay, but the small active element among
the operators were disposed to rover out
standlng short [contrarts, and an a result prices
are generally higher In pome cases
notably fÂ«->. The meeting of th*> di
rectors of the American St. el and Wire Copi
j;ir,y to settle the much discussed dispute as
to whether or not a dividend should be de
ilanj on the common stock was the central
event of interest. After ihe directors went
into session the market waited with eagerness
Hti.l expectancy for the result. Much bitterness
b;irf b^en caused among the contesting elements
over this, but the action of the stock when it
was finally announced that no dividend would
lie declared at present showed that the event
had been thoroughly discounted. The price
closed at the li!th.-~t of the day. ' l â¢ points
above the lowest. The news did not conn- Âut
until with half an hour of the close, and the
f;<rlier strength Of the market then reasserted
itself. The great improvement in thÂ» sentiment
of foreicn stock markets was reflected at the
opening here, notably In Baltimore an. Ohio.
t!:-Â» Vanderbiltis, the grangers, the Pacifies,
Continental Tobacco and a number of other
specialties. Sugar, Tenn.rs.see Coal and Iron,
American Smelting and the distilling group
were centers of weakness at one time, but with
out general effect upon the market. Metropoli
tan Street Railway was up over 4 points at one
time, end Air Brake rose 14 points. Thi gams
in the railroads as i rule were very firmly
held. The announcement of t4.000.00Q in gold
for export to-morrow had no effect on the mar
ket, as the bears had circulated rumors â  ester
day of a much larger amount, and the event
ha.l thus been discounted. London bought
stocks in this market to-dny. Another unfa

BRADSTREET'S WEEKLY FINANCIAL
REVIEW.
NEW YORK. Juno Bradstreefs financial
review to-morrow will say: Irregularity, with
some exhibitions of positive weakness, tins been
I the feature of speculation for the last Fix
days. The stork market has been professional
; to an increasing extent and there was evi
dence that powerful lnflu< noes have been active
on the bear side. Liquidation in certain spe
cialties have been visible, though in some
stocks which were prominent in this connec
tion the selling seemed to be â â 'â¢â â â  unloading of
large blocks by people identified with th*
manipulation. ["here was also a display of
strength in certain parts of the list, as, for
instance, the Vanderbilt Ftocks which might
suggest an accumulation process, and other
groups, notably the anthracite coal sh?res,
were steady and apparently waiting for devel
opments. The short interest, though naturally
; much bigger than it was some weeks ago, be
| trays â â â¢ certain amount of nervousness and a
! decided readiness to cover at concessions, which
| prevented the declines from assuming a steady
or decided character and in many cases limited
them to small dimensions. It would seem that
I the public and the street are incline"! to sus
pend judgment as to whether prices are too
high or not until a more definite conclusion as
Ito the grain crop results can be drawn. Dis
cussion of the crop outlook was. however, less
present than it was a week ago, and among
the chief bearish factors have been the proba
bility of larger gold exports, which are de
scribed in another column, being increased
by the strength of both the Berlin and
London money" markets. It did not escape no
tice, however, but New York money lias been
quiet- and the interest rates continued com
paratively easy, even in the face of require
ments caused by the extremely large interest
I and dividend disbursements failing: duo on
â  July 1.
1 The uncertainty of the Kuropean outlook and
the somewhat critical state of affairs in South
Africa, with Its unfavorable bearing on the
London market, was not without effect, and
the foreign representatives aie in the main
sellers of stocks hen-, while favorable accounts
of the activity and sustained strength of the
i iron and steel trade seemed insufficient to
I interact the Impression of the market that
! ihe capitalization of steel industrials has more
i than discounted ail the possibilities in that
I connection.
I It was also noted that he industrials fur
-1 r.ished the weakest part of the list, the break
! in the tobacco stocks being a feature, while
: the proposed amalgamation of the several
f spirit corporations in the American Distilling
! Company with a capital of (125.000,000 had no
! result so far as the market was concerned;
other than a sharp decline In American spirit
manufacturing. The traction stocks and spe
cialties were â¢ gular and weak at tlrr.ps,
though support was extended to them, and the
j action of a short interest seemed to result in
i covering and rail)
i Bonds have been active and the Investment
, demand already noticed has continued. In the
I early part of the v. ... new high record prices
I were made In a number of prime issues, but
I later u:i there wvro â -' me fi-.ictiunal concessions.
BRADSTREET'S WEEKLY TRADE RE-
VIEW
NEW YORK, June 23.â Bradstreefa to-mor- j
row will say: Less than the average effect ;
of approaching midsummer Influence Is dis- ;
cernible in current trade reports. Prices, too.
show a strength unusual at this period, and
1 particularly In view of recent steady advances.
I This is notably manifest, of course, In the
Iron and steel Industry, where the tendency of
values is Still upward, though the advances
reported are not uniform at all markets, point
ing i" individual instances of business done
; at best possible prices. Where prompt de
livery can be guaranteed, fancy quotations are
' in many capes obtainable and testimony to the
scarcity ot supplies is universal. An unprece
dented weekly out) of coke is coincident with
i statements that the usual summer shutdown
. in Iron and its allied industries will be Ig-
I norrl and claims from Pittsburg or the pla,c
--1 ing oT . -. d breaking contracts for steel rails
for export to Russia, not, however, for lm- !
I mediate livery. Predictions of $20 for Besse
! mer ire well within bight of realization, and
i warnings of overdoing the situation are more
I numerous. Hopes of Improvement in the (
woolen goods industry have materialized in the;
active demand at leading markets lor the man
ufactured product, and simultaneously from
several markets come reports of abnormally
small stocks of light weight goods in dealers'
hands. Wool Is more active and linn In sym
pathy therewith, and Bales arÂ« larger, though
mostly on speculative account. A feature is
heavy sales of high grade domestic woola to
foreign buyers, but whether this wool will go
abroad depends upon next week's London sales.
Improved crop reports are responsible chiefly
lor lower quotations of products declining in
price this week. Wheat has been affected by
' glowing reports from spring wheat sections,
j but more especially by continued enormous de
j liveries of old crop supplies, pointing to the
' 166S spring wheat yield, and. therefore, the
i aggregate yield of the country, having been
I heavily underestimated. At the decline, how
j ever, good buying on export account has de
veloped. Cotton crop pros] have continued
to improve and the raw product is lower on
j the week, with a shading claimed also in
â  print cloths, although cotton goods, as a whole. 1
i are in an exceptionally strong position. Raw |
! sugar is lower on unanimous reports of im- |
! proving crop prospects the -â â â  rid over, but re- I
i fined sugar is in heavy domestic demand and
! firm. In industrial lines generally there Is
1 little more than the usual friction in wages,
the most serious disturbance being the Colo
rado smelting works' strike. The usual sum
mer shutdown of glass factories Is now com
plete. Railroad reports point to an exception-
I ally large traffic doing and earning reports con
-1 tlnue favorable, particularly in the Northwest,
I but passenger and freight rate cuts are In
creaÃlng. Lumber retains all of its early ac
tivity and strength.
Wheat, Including flour, shipments for the
week aggregate 3.765.719 bushels, against 2,T&iÂ»,
--471 last week, 3,799,470 in the corresponding
1 week of 1898; 2,156.246 In 1897; 2,837,631 In IS9Â«,
and 1.946,402 in 1895. Since July 1 this season
I the exports of wheat aggregate 221,769,672 bush
els, against 279.073, bushels last year.
Business failures probably reflect semi-annual

DUN'S WEEKLY REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK. June 23. R. G. Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade will say to-morrow;
The outgo "I more gold this week. $1,000,000 ro
\ far reported, makes it clear that Europe la in
1 need. The French Ministerial crisis has been
grave and prolong d, the collapse of German
speculation in Industrial stocks threatens some
trouble, but perhaps the South African un
certainty rauses most disturbance: Whatever
i the case. Europe needs money and cannot
claim Its own from the west this year, but
: must borrow. Exchange and trade balances
show that this .count! is not called upon to
pay, but the money is worth more to lenders
abroad than it Is here. Home finances are
most satisfactory. Revenues tall behind expen
ditures for the fiscal year less than JIOO.GOO.iM
and hut for $230,000,000 war expenses, Including
payment for the Philippine debts and for Cv
i ban soldiers, the revenue exclusive of that
from the war taxes exceeds ordinary expenses.
Trade balances, in spite of export* from New '
York of IS per cent less than last year's and '
imports 26 per cent greater, still promise a i
large excess of exports fcr June. Nor Is there
j any substance In the idea that large foreign '
I sales of securities are moving gold. The best i
i evidence attainable shows that In January and 1
j February about $8,250,000 worth of securities
I came to thte Bide nnd since February not more
j than 000,000 in excess of shipments, In char
acter transactions have been of the. trading
ur.d not of the Investment sort, stocks are
weakened, but almost exclusively in the in- /
dustrials, which foreigners do not touch, these
declining 5- is per share on the average this
week, while railroad storks have averaged a
decline of only '.'Sc per share. Earnings for the
'â  first half of June are better than for any pre
vious month this year. 10 per cent larger than
I last year and 11.8 larger than In 1892 the
! granger roads gaining most largely over last
I year in srite of the . reduced movement of
f grain. _
In the great staples the;Jf Is a turn for the
better. Exports of wheat, flour Included, for
the week have been 3,643,672 bushels, against
THE SA^ ifItAJN CISCO CALL. SATURDAY, JUNE 24, 1899.
3,800,660 last year, and In three weeks 6,504,262,
against 11,006,738 last year.
Corn exports also continue large, 8,262,966
bushels, against 2,571,723 last year. A sharp fall
in cotton ;i!so encourages exports. These are
facts which preceded orders for gold exports
this week and do not result from them, but
show the. prospect of a larger outgo of mer
chandise in coming months. Wheat receipts
at. the West, 15,60u,658 bushels for the pas>t
three weeks, against 3,483.773 last year and
4.Mf1'.549 in the same week In 1597. show an ex
traordinary movement from the farms for the
season, indicating no suspicion there of short
age. The fall of 2c in wheat and in cotton
â â¢ m 6.31 cto 6.12 c Indicates that speculation
based on the hope of short crops is growing
wears
The textile industries are much behind In
prices, although woolen's are. now steadily ris
ing and are ti per cent higher than at their
lowest In March. The goods are in much
stronger demand and wool has advanced from
l- iic to 18.76 c for domestic, taking the aver
age of 1"" quotations by Coates Brothers,
though the buying Is largely speculative.
In cotton goods the advance has been small.
and though business Is excellent the demand
fairly meets the supply.
The great gain in the volume of business
might seem of questionable safety were it
greater in iron production, resulting from an
actual excess of demand over supply and not
from speculation. Bars are stronger by $3
per ton at the East, ugh Iron Is i\ per ton
easier at Pittsburg. but a difference of $5 per
ton in favor of steel makes the demand for
iron larger. It is Interesting that a 10,000-ton
â  rder for plates for two American liners to be
built by the i ramps has gone to Chicago, the
Eastern works being too full. Orders for fin
ished products show no decrease in quantity,
and for most lines, as for rails, are quite often
refused, speedy deliveries being impossible.
Failures for the week have, been ITS in the
United States, against 2?5 last year, and 18 in
Canada, against 11 last year. .

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, â¢ June 22.â So far as the total
amount of trading: in wheat is concerned, to
day's transactions could easily have ' en
crowded into one hour of the session with
out making it remarkably active. Business at
the close was almost at a standstill, and al
j though news was of a decidedly bearish char
'â  acter, price fluctuations were almost as nar
' row as the usual range in coarser grains. The
opening was weak. September starting at 76Vic,
compared with yesterday's closing price of
7ii"^c. and a few sales wen? made at T. : S '- short
ly alter the .-tart. That proved to be the bot
tom of the .lay. Liverpool was expected to
show strength I day, but declined instead, i
Odessa reported more rain followed to-day by
extreme heat. Rains were also reported at
other points where drouth has prevailed. On
the opening decline there was buying enough
to cause a gradual reaction to 76'7j|tfj'76 â â â .
There was no let up in the heavy primary re
celpts, and as to day's cash and export de
mand showed considerable falling off this was
again a factor in the weakness, which be
fore the close carried September down to ?âºâ /
7 i i4c . gain. September was bringing 76 1 i<376}ac
at ;i â¢ close.
Corn was heavier and lower The cash de
mand was light, and heavy receipts are looked
tor to-morrow. September closed '/jc lower.
Oats were dull and weak, principally in sym
pathy with wheat and corn. September lost
9i#'/Â£c.
Provisions were extremely dull and heavy.
Hog receipts were large and packers were sell
ers in a moderate way. September pork was
I 5c lower, lard a shade lower and ribs 2'^c
lower at the close. â¢

DECIDUOUS AM CITRUS FRUITS.
The ennners are paving the following prices:
Peaches. $20 for fret; and $"0 for clings; Apri
cots, %?,:,â  1 :.:. per ton. according to size, quality
and district; Hartl.lt Pears, $40(iJ50 per ton-
Green and Yellow Plums. $> per ton.
I The upward tendency continues anil the can
! ners are paying better prices for Harriett Pears I
and Apricots, as will he seen above. At the j
same time, Apricots in the southern part of the
State are going as low as 1205/30 per ton, and
some have sold even down to $15. In the cen- i
tral and northern parts of the State, however
: they cannct be bought at any such low prlceal
The local market Is but Indifferently supplied
I with fruit, as the heavy demand for the East
I and North draws the best lots away from this
point. The northern demand for Portland, the
Sound and Alaska In said to be enormous" this
year. In fact, this is one of the best fruit years
. the State has ever seen.
More Cantaloupes came in from Winters and
sold at $1 26Â©1 50 per box.
At present there is not an oversupply of any
fruit on the market, which is something re- 1
markable. 1 -'- ."â  -â â¢" â - -"'. â  'â¢â :

HIDES, TALLOW. WOOL AND HOPS.
I Hides are quiet and the Eastern market has
â  lately fallen off %@%e.
! Jacob Woiiner's circular says of Wool: "Our
W... 1 market Is still active. Mostly all avail
able Wools which were not limited have been
sold. In fact. I can say there are not 6,000.000
; pounds of unsold Wool in this market. This
j year's California spring clip is very Bhort in
Quantity, and it has all been marketed with
tho exception of Humboldt and Mendoclnos. At
the sales now going "n In Vkiah 17^c has been
ofTen'-d. but growers ask from 20i@21C. T/a<t
week ;it the Cloverdale Wool Wools
brought all Hie way from 14@17c. There are a
good rii.iny ( irepon and Washington Wools com
intr Into this market, but those Territories, as
well as Nevada, are pretty well cleaned up.
Prices rule as high, if not higher, in the ooun
try than they do In the seaboard markets. It
is purely speculative, with the expectation that
manufacturers will have to come Into the mar
ket and pay the prices, as we are on a par with
the European markets, so we cannot import
! any Wools. If the I>milnn sales which will
open the 27th Instant advance 10 per cent as
expected, a ereat ninny of our domestic Wools
I will be exported, so it seems that Wool will be
; good property. The only 'drawback is that
manufacturers cannot cct prices for woolens, as
the people still want cheap Roods,, end with the
1 f Wools htjrher, goods have to be raised
â¢j". to â¢" l1 per cent before manufacturers will be
Justified In paying the prices asked for the raw
' material."

Harrison's circular says of Coal: "During:
I the week there have been seven deliveries of
coal from Washington, 14,380 tons; three from
British Columl la, 9769 tons; two from Oregon,
! 4f.Q tons; one fn m Swansea, 3350 tons; two from
: Australia. 6i<W tons; two from Japan, dX,') tons;
â  total, 40,907 tons. These are the largest arrivals
of â  lal we have had Â»ny week so tar this year, j
; Much the larger portion of it will be delivered
t to 1 nsumere, hence local prices will nut
be affected. Two cargoes ol' M(\ji coal from
Japan are at hard this week; it Is a long time
â¢-in .- any shipments Of this grade have been
made here. It is reputed to be a very effective
steam coal, but its high cost at point of ship
' ment precludes any liberal deliveries here.
' Business is reported brisk in the fuel line for
Bteam purposes, with no change of values. As
an cm iblished rate appears to be rlx.rd for the
! moment for grain freights to Europe, but little
i!u tuatiqn may be looked for in inward foreign
1 coal values. It is singular this year the simi
larity of coal freights from Swansea and Aus
tralia which have been ruling; at present they
are botii Identical, about 35s per ton. The pres
ent outlook would indicate that there will be no
I low-priced coal offered on this market in 1899,
there is too much demand for tonnage in other
' foreign ports at full figures for any to seek this
i port with cheap coal, besides coast frrights will
assuredly rule high all this year. This should
leave a good profitable market for our northern
products for several month? to come."

THE STOCK MARKET.
Business in securities was light on the morn-
Ing session of the Bona Exchange, and the only
change was a slight advance in Gas and Elec
tric.
'>n the afternoon call Giant PowdÂ»r declined
to $70 50
Mining stocks continued to rise, with In
creased sales in several mines. The advance
is said to he due to an improvement In the
1750-foot level of the Consolidated California
a.nd Virginia, where a small but widening body
of ere lias been found. The average assay of
this ore is $-15 per ton. The telegram from the
pump said: "The second elevator is running
steadily on one-third time and is holding the
water. The first elevator is being lowered, and
we expect to have it ready for running within
two days."
The annual meeting of the Union Consolidated
Mining Company has been called for July IT.
The official report from the Standard Con
solidated mine at Bodie for the week ending
June 17 states that the usual development work
was done on the ISO, 200, 270, 318, 3SO, 470, 52$
and .-52 foot levels, and in most of the open
ings tair to good ore is showing. The stopes in
the Moyle, New, No. 10 and Fortuna ledges fur
nished the regular quantity of ore, some of
which from the Fortuna vein was of very good
quality. At the mill 265 tons of ore were
crushed for the week. Average assay of vanner
tailings was $10 S4. Concentrates produced were
IVi tons: assay value, $131 84. Plate amalgam
produced, 1525 troy ounces; value per ounce,
$2 81. Tailings plant No. i treated 323 tons of
tailings and plant No. 2 treated 139 tons tail
incs.

Mrs. Thomas Lane of Haywards told a
pitiful and somewhat romantic story to
/iay to the District Attorney to induce
-â¢ .im to issue a warrant against her hus
band charging him nil not providing for
l.s little boy.
There is another woman who- occupies
a leading part In Mrs. Lane's story and
the deserted wife tells with great glee
how she recently had the â¢ .sure of
putting it all over' her.
I Mr. and Mrs. Lane have li\ ed at Hay
wards lor many years. They have been
married over fifteen years and everything
was smooth and merry till Mr. Lane saw
a young lady that possessed more attrac
tions for him than his wife. Then the
troubles began in â  arm st. Lan stayed
away from home at long Intervals, which
gradually increased in number and dura
tion. He passed much of his time at. the
.iisreputable Thalia saloon on the San
Leandro road, which was closed last
we- t -k. Lane thtn had to move, so he
"pened up a second housekeeping estab

lived. Ho installed Miss Lillie Cowan as

what happened, but â¢ her* was a noise as
of an â¢â arth'iuake in the house for a few

Mr. Lane and his wife's rival disap
poared. but his wife followed on his trail
und located the guilty Â«-ouple at Santa
Â«'ruz. There was another scene at that
city, after which Mrs. Lane returned to
Oakland and swore to a warrant for her
husband's arrest:
Mrs. Lane declares that her husband
Is guilty of the grossest Ingratitude and
declares thai whatever he has is due to
h'T industry and frugality. When their
son was but two years old Mrs. Lane
says that she went out to work so that
hfr husband might learn the blacksmith
trade, and he has repaid all her fidelity
by deserting her and flaunting his dis
grace before his family.

OAKLAND OFFICE SAN* FRANCISCO CALL. POS BROADWAY, June
23.â Dr. G. F. Chalmers, the "Mayor" of Niles and a popular physician
of that place, has undertaken a novel crusade and has met with most
pronounced success. The doctor has never been a temperance lecturer
and has always enjoyed a "treat" with his friends. Recently he called Bev
eral of "the hoys" together and conferred with them regarding the feasibil
ity of quitting the treating habit. A score of the most prominent merchants
of Niles agrreed with the doctor that it was foolish, expensive and tended
to produce had habits.
The following pledge was drawn up and is now being circulated,
the merchants having formed themselves into the Niles Anti-Treating So
ciety, with Dr. Chalmers as president:
We, the undersigned citizens of Nil?*, Pal., and members of the N'iles Anti-
Treating Society, do solemnly pledge ourselves not to drink with, or smoke, at the
expense of any member of this society, and further agree not to ask or solicit any mem
ber of this order, whose signature appears herewith, to join us in either a social smoke
or drink. We agree, each and all, to abide by the foregoing, on our honor as gentle
men, for a term of six months from date.
Nlles, Cal., June 20.
Among the signers are: Dr. M. R. Sneden, druggist; E. C. Schleuter,
butcher; John Briscoe, grocer; A! Parsons, assistant station agent: \Y. H.
Champion, farmer: W. H. Hunt, orchardlst: T. 11. Tyson and Frank Nunes.
It has been suggested that December 20â five days before Christmasâ ls a
very diplomatic* date for the pledge to expire.

908 Broadway, June 23.
Some Impatient firecrackers in a store
at Washington and Ninth streets opened
up the 4th of July celebration in this city
to-day, and for some time threatened the
destruction of a large business block.
ThÂ»- st. ire contained Immense quantities

turned In the whole Mock w;is a mass of
smoke and for a long distance rould be
heard the cracking, bursting and shoot

that an necessary to celebrate Independ

ThÂ«> Fire Department lost no time in

and the exhibition pyrotechnics was

packi I out bo: exploding torpedoes
and firecrackers. Assistant Fire Chief
Lawton had a very narrow escape from
being struck on the head by a large iron
pot. It was hung up In front â¢â ! a case
of torpedoes. The whole case went u;> at

store, the handle tearing a hole in the

No one known how the fire started. The
clerks in th Btore were first attracted
to it by seeing a ! it of firecrackers in the

were simpij bursting with patriotism and
off they went. This little exhibition will

GARDEN THIEF REAPPEARS.
He Eludes the Vigilance of the Ala
meda Police.
ALAMEDA, Juno 23.â The thief who has
b( - n despoiling the flower gardens of Ala
meda, carrying away wagon loads of
choice plants, vases, garden ornaments
and everything else movable, has made
liis reappearance. His description lias
been given to the police repeatedly, and
the inability of the detectives to appre
hend him has resulted in severe comment.
A few days ago the premises of William
Pettes, 12M Lafayette street, were visited
and two valuable jardinieres and a num
ber of potted plants taken. Th<> theft was
reported to the police and they promised
to make an Investigation. The detectives
got no clew to the offender until this
morning, whir. E. Spencer, 867 Cedar
eet, reported that his front yard had
been stripped during the night and noth
ing was left of his ueautifu! flower gar
den but the holes in the earth, where the
plants and shrubs had grdwn.
The police promised again to continue
th^ir Bearcfa for the culprit. Detectives
Dennis Welch and Joseph Lawrence have
been detailed on the case.
The thief is apparently in ignoranco of
the exlstenci of the Alameda police force,
fur each successive j"b is nearer the- City
Hall, and it is expected that the next raid
will be mode mi ihe (garden surrounding

GRAHAM SAYS HE DID IT.

Her Change Her Clothes.
ALAMEDA, Juno 23.â Daniel Graham,
who, with his wife, is charged with par
boiling his mother-in-law, appeared be
fore Recorder St. Sure this morning and
pleaded not guilt>. \Vhen Mrs. Graham

to secure her arrest she was prostrated.
She lost consciousness, and for some
hours her condition was critical. She was
too Blck to-day to appear in court. The
cases will not be set for trial until she
rectn 1 rs.
Graham, who is an ex-sea captain, now
artinits that he "hosed down" his mother
in-law on one occasion, but claizna that
he had the best intentions in doing no.
According to his version, the old lady was
Btubborn about changing hrr apparel
when he thought shr had worn it long
1 nough, and to force her to put on new
raiment he got her into the back yard
and soaked her with a stream from the
garden hose.
When she was wet through she was
compelled to change her clothing for her
own comfort, and the son-in-law hud won
a victory.

THE SHOCK MAY PROVE TO BE
FATAL.
Accident Occurred Yesterday Morning
Near the Nurses' Home Which
Was Recently Founded by
Mrs. Requa.
Oakland Office Pan Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, June 23.
Isaac 1.. Requa, president of the Central
Pacific Railroad Company, was thrown
fp.rn his buggy this morning and bus
tained some severe but not necessarily
b< rious injuries. .Mr. Requa wa? driving
to Oakland from his home in Piedmont.
A Bhort distance ahead of him Colonel
and Mrs. Long. Mr. Requa's daughter,
\\>tv being- driven by a coachman.
When passing Keller's nursery Colonel
and .Mrs. Long saw a horse attached
to the empty, broken buggy of her
father dash past. Hastily turning
they found .\lr. Requa being as
sisted by two men to rise from the road.
His head was cut and he said he had
sustained a si vere shock. He was taken
to the Fabiola Nurses' Home, the insti
tution which has been recently opened
by the efforts largely of Mrs. Requa.
An examination of -Mr. Requa' 8 injuries
showed that no bones were broken, but
that he had met with a badly lacerated
scalp, a cut over the eye, three bruised
ribs and a Bevere shock to his nervuus
system.
The Imisc being driven by Mr. Requa
stumbled, and a moment later started off
suddi nly at a rapid gait and ran into an
electric light pole. Mr. Requa was thrown
out a distance of fifteen feet and lande I
on his head. Being a man of heavy build
and of advanced age tin shuck was v-ery
great, and f"i some hours serious fear's
were entertained. A flna) ;h<irough ex
amination by the family physician, Dr.
Ltliencrantz, however, convinced him
that Mr. Reaua was not seriously tn-
Jured. This evening he was able to b^
:â¢ moved to his home. Mrs. Keqna, who is
at Castle Crag, left fur her home this
afternoon.
Frank Kelly, one of the men who as
sisted Mr. Kequa to rise, says it was one :
of the worst runaways he ever saw "Wo
saw a biiÃpy coming violently toward us
its driver sawing and trying to curb the
horse," said he. "As he came opposite
yonder electric pole on the opposite side
of th- road the horse shied into it and !
then shot clear of both buggy and har- i
ness and ran down the road to Rohan's
blacksmith shop, where, we are told, hÂ«
was stopped on the sidewalk.
"The driver at the moment of the col
lision with the electric pole, was pitched
out over the dashboard, striking appa
rently exactly on the top of hrs head. j
When we: reached him he was trying to j
rise, and we were helping him when his â 
people came up. We expected to find him :
dashed to pieces, and were surprised to
hear him speak, saying. 'Oh, my,' or
something like that."
The horse driven by Mr. Requa is a
very fractious animal, and a few days ago I
ran away while Colonel and Mrs." .Long j
were driving .
VOGT CASE NOT ENDED.
An Appeal From Judge Edgar's De
cision to Be Taken.
BERKELEY, June 2Xâ Attorneys Chap
man and Cllft of Oakland and Judge
Edgar of the Berkeley Justice Court had
a disagreement this morning over a point
of law in the rase of Henry W. Vogt,
and as a result the Oakland attorneys
will pot out a writ of mandate to bring
the case before the Superior Court for
review.
Vogt came up before Judge Edgar last
week on a charge of battery upon Patrick
O'Neill. O'Neill is over seventy-three
yearn of ago. residing on Acton street
To the satisfaction of the court it was
shown that Vogt had assaulted the old
man in a most cowardly manner and
Judge Edgar ordered him to appear for
sentence. As Vogt failed to put in an
appearance on the date set Judge Edgar
declared his bail forfeited. His attornÂ°ys
filed notice of :> notion asking that the
order be vacated and this morning they
were present in court to argue in its be
half. Judge Edgar's denial of the motion
led to a long legal discussion, at the con
clusion of which the Judge adhered to his
decision. Attorney Clift entered an ex
m and declares that he will ask for
a writ of mandate.

Annual Agony of the
Board of Works.
MR. SNOW ON UMBURGER
GEORGE CARLTON TO TASTE
DEADLY DRUGS.
Mr. Dow Will Inspect the Soap for
Prisoners and Mr. Clement the
Axle Grease and Horse
Pills.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. June 23.
The rooms of the Board of Works now
resemhle a cheap John store. There is a
little of everything on exhibition from
limburger cheese to horsecombs, while a
few cabbage, lumps of coal and samples
of sulphuric acid are placed in one cor
ner.
When the Mayor entered the office this
morning he did not understand why the
extra tables had been built and such a
conglomeration of commodities were on
view, until he recollected that bids are
DOW AND THE LIMBURGER.
now invited to supply the City Prison, the
City Hall, the School Department, Fire
Department. Police Department and all
the offices with all the matt-rial they may
need for the year commencing July 1.
"This is the most ticklish job I have
struck yet," said the Mayor. "One needs
to be many kinds of an expert to do jus
tice to all the merchants who want to sell
goods to the city. I know but little of
sulphuric acid, and less of blankets for
prisoners. As to potatoes, cabbage and
unions, I feel at home, having for years
been in the commission business. I also
know a little about chickens, but I see
that no chickens are supplied to the pris
oners."
The Mayor took up a little package
very carefully ami called to Secretary
Jnckson to come and open it. The secre
tary has spent mmh or his life in the
mines, and is not easily upset. The little
package, which the Mayor viewed with
suspicion, was the loudest thing on ex
hibition. It almost talked. But every
thing was explained when the secretary,
after a good long sniff, said "limburger."
Monte Clement, the City Engineer, is
better posted on samples of mini from
J,ake Mtrritt than on soap, and he face
tiously remarked that this department of
the samples be referred to Mr. Dow. Th"
engineer, however, is quite willing to fin
ally pass on the merits of axle grease and
the currycombs.
A few small bottles were handled with
great care. They were samples of some
drugs required for the prisoners and tho
horses in the Fire Department.
Not long ago| a special flume was con-
CLEMENT AND THE CAB

' structed from the City Prison to the fresh
i air for the purpose of carrying off the
! objectionable odor of the cabbages that
are fed to the prisoners three days each
week. So offensive w.*re these cabbage
days that the Board of Works and the
I Police Commission arranged their sched
ule of meetings bo as not ti> be in session
i when the prisoners were bt-ing banqueted
with kail broth. The three Commission
ers are therefore very anxious that the
' cabbages to be supplied .the next year
! shall he more tame than those now in
! use. The Mayor, the City Engineer and
1 the City Attorney have each taken pos
] session of the samples of cabbage to be
I tested in their own kitchens. It has been
: decided to have a special report on cab
â  bages with a supplementary report by the
I city chemist, who has been instructed to
analyze the fumes arising from the boil
ers. It 1b expected that all samples will
have been tested so that the board at
next woek's meeting can award the con

HALF THE SHE
OF COLUMBIA'S
GREAT DISPLAY
The Paris Exposition
Small but Fine.
ONLY THE BEST DESIRED
â â â¦ â
COMMISSIONER RUNYON TELLS
OF HIS EASTERN TRIP.
All Exhibits and Each Exhibitor Will
Receive the Same Consideration
at the Hands of the Jury
of Awards.
Paris Commissioner E. W. Runyon, who
has returned from his visit to Commis
sioner General Peck, was received most
cordially. He found the Commissioner
General, as well as the heads of the dif
ferent departments, very enthusiastic
over the large appropriation that Califor
nia has made; knowing that the products
of this State arc such as to make a very
much better exhibit than probnbly any
other State in the Union.
It is the commissioner's idea to make a '
Californlan exhibit in the departments of !
agriculture, horticulture, viticulture, ir>in
bag, forestry and fishing. On acount of the i
large appropriation made by California,
Commissioner Peck cabled the French au
thorities as to wheth-T we could have the
privilege of putting up a State building in
which to have a collective exhibit. The j
return cable came from i'aris to the I f
fect that the exposition was to be not an
interstate but an Internationa] capital ex- I
hibition, and no Stat> would have â  col
lective exhibit. Should we have been given
this privilege, however, we would not
have had the time to send our California j
woods to I'aris and erect a suitable build- '
Ing. After carefully looking over the situ
anon the commissioners thought it much i
more desirable to exhibit the products of
California in competition with those of â 
the world, which means that we will have
our different exhibits together with those
of the world; yet the catalogue will give !
credit to the different countries. States
and individuals from which the exhibits .
have come.
The Honorable F. J. V. Skiff will have
charge of the mining exhibit: Professor!
Charles Richard Doage of Washington,
D. C. has charge of agriculture, viticul
ture and horticulture; Hon. Williard A. i
Smith of Chicago will lock after trans
portation; Dr. Tarleton H. Bean Is di
rector of forestry and fisheries. All of the I
gentlemen named assure us that Califor- !
nla will be given sufficient space for its
different exhibits, and all of the gentle
men are anxious that we should make as i
large an exhibit as possible and assun us
that every consideration will be shown ;
our State.
The exposition will open April 15. 1900, j
and closes November 5 of the same year. I
The grounds are located in the center of
Paris, on the banks of the river S<=ine.
and include 136 acres. This is efjnal to
less than one-half of the area occupied by
the Columbian Exposition at Chicago, but .
it fs the purpose of the exposition not to |
have large displays but of the very best.
By the comprehensive system of ,<ihel
ing." which will be adopted, the name and
address of the contributor <>r exhibitor
and the locality from which the specimen
was derived, will always appear, .mc l , in
the case of State or ether association ex
hibits, special descriptive placards, neatly
framed, will be conspicuously p>aced in or
upon the case in which such exhibits are
installed in order that the contributor
shall derive the fullest beneiit from the
exhibit.
Every exhibitor will receive the same
consideration From the jury of awards as
though he were exhibiting on a space al
lotted to him as an Individual and cover
ing many tquare feet *n area.
The Hon. H. J. Rodders, director of edu
cation, is expected to visit California
within a few days. Professor Dodge will
also have two representatives from the
Kast some time during the month to con
fer with the California eommi.-sioners re
garding erbibitâ agriculture, viticulture
and horticulture.

It was shortly after 8 o'clock last night

which found a vent in numberless mo

due to the vigorous and continual pound

IDA LOVENTHAL'S MURDER.
Woman Killed by Some Person Un
known to the Coioner's Jury.
A Coroner's jury yesterday in the mat
ter of the inquest on the body of Mrs. Ida
Hose I-uventhal returned a verdict to the
effect that sin- came to her death from
an incised wound on the right eht-pk in
flicted with a sharp instrument in the
hands of some party or parties unknown.
W. J. Mochel, a private in Company X
Eighteenth Infantry. U. S. A., was present
at the inquest in custody of a polio- offi

Kearny street, between Washington and
Jackson, got into an altercation with her.
When one of the waiters, J. Clifford,
ran into the room he saw the woman
lying on the lounge and Mochel striking
her on the head with a beer bottle, for the
contents of which he had just paid a dol
lar. The waiter wrenched the bottle out
of Mochel'a hands and broke it upon the
soldier's head. Mochel escaped from the
saloon, hut was caught within a Oiock by
Policemen Thomai K. FTlnn and Mc-
Grayan and Special Officer Tannian and
Daggctt. No knife was found on the
prisoner or anywhere along his path of
flight.
The medical testimony was that the
fatal wound could not have been inflicted
with an unbroken beer bottle and that a
knife must have been used.

TRIES TO END HIS
LIFE WITH A RAZOR
William Seiter, While Temporarily Insane, Seriously Wounds
Himself Before the Weapon Is Wrested From
Him by His Wife.
WII.T.IAM BEITER, who keeps a restaurant at 132fi Polk street, at
tempted to cm himself open with a razor early yesterday morning
while mentally unbalanced through a series of misfortunes. He was
> ki n to the Receiving Hospital in the patrol wagon, and Dr. Tormey
ed and dressed six wounds in his abdomen which he had Inflicted with
B i izor. Two of the wounds, which are In the shape of a cross, are long and
Jeep, but ]>r. Tormey did not think they would prove dangerous.
has b( â¢ ii a sufferer from consumption for the past three years.
._â â¢â¢ he and his family cam) here from Sacramento, and soon
ward his troubles commenced. He went Into a deal for the purchase of a
saloon and dropp â '. $600. Six months ago his stepdaughter. May Matson, 15
years of ace. of whom he whs passionately fond. died. A week ago he pur
. restaurant on l*o!k street, and a day or two later some one stole
â  i the till.
All these misfortunes and others preyed on his mind and. combined with
his long sickness, made him despondent. On Thursday night he acted queerly
and i told his wife that it would be better if they would all die to
be with May. Mrs. Setter tried to soothe him. and he fell asleep.
V ;terday morning, between 5 and 6 o'clock, while Mrs. Setter was In the
ukfast, Setter, who was in bed, took a razor and slashed
\ times. His stepson, John Matson, a boy 12 years of age,
siw him. and ran into the kitchen and told his mother. Together they hur
ried Ini Iroom and wrenched the razor from Scitor.
Owing* to the condition of his mind he will probably I>*Â» examined by the
this morning, although his wif<? is anxious to take
where by kindness and attention he may recover from his weak
balanced state.
TO LOOK INTO

Id and made such ;i fight
for the prize that the tide turned and the
prize seemed destined to go their way.
Then it was charged that the stone to be
furnished by the wise men from the East

ment ordered an Investigation to be made
by a hoard composed of Assistant Secre
tary Vanderlip. Superintend! -it Roberts
and Dr. Whitehead, a Treasury Depart

When se Ly Mr. Vanderlip said
he had as yet received no direct commun

reference to the matter, but was await

Whitehead came In on last night's over

had nothing to say, as nothing definite

in addition to looking into the matter

He will also investigate the matter of

NEARLY WENT ON POINT ARENA
The French bark Amiral Troude had a narrow escape Thursday morning. She was on her way here
from Australia and in a dead calm drifted down on Point Arena. A lucky streak of wind came along just in
time and gave her the necessary offing before it died down again. The Amiral Troude arrived yesterday.
1 of this city are considerably higher than
they are at any of the other branch
United Sfc tea Mints, in some cases the
difference amounting to nearly 50 per
cent.
If thp expected reduction in charges
come to pass it will be hailed with
j delight by returning Klondikers, private
assay offices and all others doing busi
: n< -s in that line.
STRUCK AT THE OFFICER.
An Angry Crowd Threatened to At
tack Policeman Ryan.
Thomas Masterson, a young man. went
into a butcher shop at Sixth and Brannan
streets last evening and stole a knife,
which he secreted in his clothing. Police
man James Ryan followed Masterson as
he left the shop and placed him under ar
rest. He marched the fellow to the near
est patrol box, and while he was ringing
in for the wagon Henry Klein, alias Nick
Ayres, a friend of the prisoner, attempted
to rescue Masterson from the officer.
Ryan grabbed his prisoner, and as he
did so Klein attempted to strike the po
liceman. Ryan promptly knocked Klein
down and then handcuffed him. The
struggle attracted a large crowd of men,
several of whom threatened the officer.
Cries of "Lynch him!" "Hang the
brute!" were hurled at Ryan, and tor a
time it looked as though the sympa
thizers of the prisoners were about to
make a concerted attack on Ryan. Just
then the patrol wagon reached the Â«cene
and the two men were hurridly driven t i
the City Prison. Masterson was charged
with petty larceny and Klein with vulgar
language and resisting an officer.
ALLEGED BURGLARS CAUGHT.
Believed to Be the Men Who Robbed
Marlow & Stoddard's Cigar
Factory.
Fred Cunningham, an ex-convict, and
Pat Murphy were arrested last night by
Detectives Ryan and ODea and locked
up in the tanks pending an investigation.
The detectives are strongly inclined to
believe that Cunningham, assisted by
Murphy, broke into Mario & Stoddard's
cigar factory at 11 Annie lane early
Wednesday morning and got away with a
large quantity of cigars and tobacco. The
burglars used a wagon to carry off their
spoils.
During the past few months the same
factory has been entered several times
and several hundrd dollars' worth of stuff
Stolen. Cunningham, it Is claimed, was
Been driving away from the scene of the
burglary shortly after the place had been
broken into. He has already served three
mis in the penitentiary.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JUNE 24, 1899.
FRENCH FLEET OF
MERCHANTMEN
COMING HERE
Amiral Troude Forms
Advance Guard.
MANY NEW VESSELS BUILDING
â â¦ â
KEELS OF OCEANIC COMPANY'S
STEAMERS LAID.
Four Big Schooners for the Coast
Trade Nearing Completion.
Troops for the Yukon
and Manila.
The French bark A 'miral Troude ar
rived from Newcastle, N. S. W., yester
day after a long passage of eighty-three
days. Light winds and calms were re
sponsible for the delay. While working
his way down the coast Captain Mace
got his vessel very close to Point Arena.
Ivuckily a friendly streak of wind came
from the right quarter and the bark was
got about and stood safely out to sea.
The Amtral Troude is the first of a
French fleet now on its way to the coast.
Two years ago a merchantman Hying the.
tricolor was a rarity In these waters, but
the flag will be seen in ever increasing
numbers from this time on. France is
now paying a heavy mileage subsidy to
its merchant vessels and in consequence
a big fleet has been built and commis
sioned during the past year. Of these
new vessels ten are on their way here
from Swansea, six from Newcastle, N. S.
W., one from Hamburg and one from
Antwerp, while three more are bound for
Pug<H Bound ports.
If the Amiral Troude made a long voy
age the American bark Kufus E. Wood
Is making a longer one. She is now out
ninety-eight days from Sydney, N. S. W.,
but may drop in any hour. Ten days ago
she was only about 700 miles off port.
The overdue British ship Eurasia was
spoken on May 10 in latitude 4 north,
longitude 28 west. The underwriters were
anxious about her ami b per cent premi
um was offered to reinsure vessel and
cargo. The Eurasia left here on Janu
ary 7 with a cargo of barley and wheat
tor England. There were 8942 centals oi
the barley and Captain Hughes consid
ered that so much of the BtufC made his
ship "under." He accordingly figured
on making a long voyage as he would
shorten sail as soon as it began to blow.
The fact that the vessel was tender prob
ably accounts for the reinsurance, for the
F. S. Ciampa that sailed two days, before
her has not arrived yet and no rein
surance has been paid on her.
Henry Peterson got off a new answer
(at Least it is new to the water front) t'>
an old question yesterday. The lulled
States cruiser Philadelphia is lying in
the stream off Peterson's boathousi and
all day long he is besieged with questions
relative to the warship. One bright
young maiden turned to him alter he had
partially satisfied her curiosity and
asked:
"Why do you always call the Philadel
phia 'she.' Mr. Peterson?"
"Because there are so many arms about
her. " answered "Pete," without cracking
a smile. The young lady asked n<> more
questions.
The officers of the United States trans
port Sheridan and the heads of the quar
termaster's department art- in a quandary.
They have the remains of two soldiers
on their hands, and whether to send them
back to Manila with the transport or keep
them here is what is bothering them.
One thing is certain, there has been gross
carelessness somewhere and In a matter
over which the greatest of care should
have been taken. The Sheridan brought
up quite a number of caskets In which
reposed the remains of volunteers killed
while lighting the battles of their coun
try. Two oi these caskets have no iden
tifying mark on them, nor is there any
thing in the ship's papers to show whose
bodies they contain. Until the authori
ties at Manila can be heard from the COf
tins will either have to remain on the
wharf here or go buck with the trans
port. If the authorities at Manila can
throw no light on the matter, then tin
bodies will have to be buried among the
"unknown dead."
The Sheridan and Valencia will pail for
Manila to-day. The former will take
away over 1300 men, while the remain. lei
of the Twenty-fourth Regiment (colored;
will leave on the Valencia. :
Hall lirus.' shipyard at Port Blakeley
has enough work on hand to keep it busy
fur a year to come. Four vessels for the
Bugar and coasting trade are now on the
stocks and will be launched during the
year. One vessel is to be a duplicate of
the schooner Mary K. Foster that ar
rived from Honolulu last Friday. She is
being built for Alien Ac Robertson ol Ho
noluiu. G. E. Billings will be managing
owner of the oilier three, all of which
will be four-masted schooners. One of
them will be called the Winslow, alter
the late Captain Hall, and will be com
manded by 1". S. Hirkholm, now of the
F. S. Redfleld. The other will be com
manded by Captain E. E. Smith, now of
the Marie E. Smith, and she will be chris
tened the William il. Smith In honor of
the captain's father. The third vessel has
not ye! been named, but she will be com
manded by Captain Rasmftssen late of
the schooner Vega. The Vega was pur
chased by C. D Lane last month and is
now on her way to St. Michael with a.
load of lumber.
The Alaska Commercial Company's
steamer St. Paul will sail to-morrow for
St. Michael with soldiers for the various
military stations on the Yukon. Colonel
Ray will be in command and about 430
soldiers all told will go on the steamer'
The members of the Press Club -tnd
their friends will have a most enjoyable
time on the bay to-morrow. The steamer
Sunol has been chartered and will l< aye
Washington street at 9:45 a. m. The Union
Iron Works and Hunters Point dryd jck
will be visited, and at 11 a. m. a lard
ing will be made at Sausalito. The ]â¢;,.
cific Yacht Club has given the use of its
clubhouse, and there the excursionists
will have lunch. From Sausalito the Su
nol will take the party to Army Point and
then back to San Francisco, reaching
Washington-street wharf at 6 p. m.
J. J. McDevltt. the popular and oblig
ing night clerk at the Merchants' Ex
change, is back again at his post. "Mac
and his friend. "Pete" Black, have been
"doing" La Honda. Peseadero, Spanish
town and other places in the vicinity.
During his vacation "Mac" gained ten
pounds in weight, and returns to his work
like a giant refreshed.
THEIR KEELS ARE LAID.
No time is being lost in the building of
the three ocean greyhouds for the
Oceanic Steamship Company. The kecld
of all have been laid in Cramp's shipyard
at Philadelphia, and March next should
see one of them in San Francisco, vhv
new boats are to be called after the coun
ties of Ventura, Sonoma and Sierra. The
keel of the Ventura was laid several days
ago, that of the Sierra was put down yes
terday and the laying of the Sonoma's
keel will be completed to-day.
The new steamers are for the San
Francisco-Honolulu- Apia-Auckland and
Sydney trade and will probably inaug
urate a fortnightly service between Cali
fornia and Australia. They are to be 'JOOO
-ton ships, with all the latest Improve
ments, and will be models of beauty, com
fort and strength.
FIRE DEPARTMENT BILLS.
Must All Be Sent In Before June 28,
Otherwise They Will Not
Be Paid.
The Fire Commissioners met yesterday
afternoon and a request was made that
all bills against the department be sent
in on or before June 28. otherwise they
will not be paid, as the funds must come
out of the appropriation for the fiscal
year just closing.
A petition from residents in the Ingl*
side district asking for fire protection was
submitted and it was referred to Chief
Sullivan to inquire Into and report.
J. P. Goldstein, hoseman of Engine 6,
was charged with insubordination and
was found guilty and dismissed from the
department. Charles r'erguson, engineer
of Engine 11, was fined three days' pay for
leaving the engine house with only one
man in it, and Fred Sharon, engineer, and
John Blythe, driver of Engine 32, were
fined five days" pay for staying away too
long at meals and ordered to bo trans
ferred.

The entertainment committee of La Ks
troila Parlor No. 89 of the Native Daugh
ters of the Golden West, consisting of
Miss Minnie Klevesahl, Miss Mattie Fest,
Mrs. May Hansen, Miss Madge Lessley
and Miss A. Panella, has completed all
the arrangements for the entertainment
and dance to be given in Native Sons'
Hall next Saturday evening. The princi
pal feature of the programme will be a
farce by members of the parlor. In the
past all functions of this bright parlor
have been successful, and It Is likely that
this will be no exception to the rule.

The Servian Montenegrin Literary and
Benevolent Society will hold its annual
picnic at Schuetzen Park to-morrow.
Boats will leave the Tiburon ferry Blip

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JUNE 24, 1899.
SUPERVISORS PLEDGE
THE ONE DOLLAR TAX
Mayor and the Board Will Keep
Their Platform Promise.
They Declare That the City fiovernment Can Be Run
for a Year on Three Million Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars in Taxes.
Â£f-t r-Cs A TOR niET.AX and a ma
//\J/\i - 1 " rit >' of the Board of
II \( \i Supervisors declare that
II J\ >\ they will keep the promise
which they made to the
people that nominat ed and elected them
and will fix a tax rate for the coming
fiscal year at not greater than $1 on a
hundred upon an assessed valuation of
$350,000,000. This means that the Super
visors will not raise by taxation more
than $3,500,000. no matter what the as
sessed valuation of the property may
be. The reiteration of this pledge at
this time is of vital importance to the
city. If the promise be kept taxpayers
will save at least 40 cents on every $100
valuation in their property. The re
newal of the pledge is timely also as
the Supervisors will be called upon soon
to fix the tax rate.
It seems, therefore, that the city has
at last elected municipal officers who in j
one important matter will keep their
pledges to the people. The tax rate last
year was $1 31 on an assessed valuation
of (352,000.000. The difference between
that and what it will be this year may
readily be seen, but the entire saying j
to taxpayers is not all included in the
comparison. Assessor Washington
Dodge has assured the Mayor and
members of the Board of Supervisors
that the assessed valuation of real
property will exceed $350,000,000. It will
be at least $375,000,000, and probably
(400,000,000.
If it be the latter figure the rate to
taxpayers will he SV I ,^ cents, instead of
$1 31 as it was last year. This will be
absolutely the meaning of the promise
of the Mayor and the Supervisors ex
pressed in other terms. A dollar rate on
$350,000,000 means a total taxation of
$3,500,000. A rate of S7*Â£ cents on $400.
--000,000 means precisely the same reve
nue. If the assessed valuation reaches
$400,000,000 the rate will then be 87&
cents. This fact, coupled with the re
newed and absolute promise of the
Mayor and Supervisors, should be a
matter for general congratulation.
In discussing the matter yesterday,
Mayor Phelan and a. majority of the
Supervisors were frank. Both the
Democrats and the Republicans were
pledged liy their party platforms to a
tnx rate of %\ on an assessed valuation
of $350,000,000. They were, therefore,
with three exceptions, absolutely with
out qualification in their promise to
keep their pledge. Supervisor Black
favored keeping his promise, but wan
not surp enough of his ground to ex
press an opinion. Supervisor Kalben
wants to observe his party pledge, hut
is not altogether safe in doing so, ;is
imperative public improvements may
induce him to violate it. Supervisor
Collins considers the whole matter as
a joke, which is certainly justified by
the unfortunate fact of his official ex
istence. With a peculiarly offensive
blackguardism which is his character
istic, he declined with an oath to dis
cuss thr> affair.
The situation in r^fcr^ncf to thf> tax
levy was ably summarized by Mayor
J'hflan In his message t<> tlio Rnard of
Supervisors delivered on th<^ 3d day of
last January. Jn that message Mayor
Phelan said:
The entire Board of Supervisors In
pledged to conduct the city government
on :i basis of SI on each $100 of $350
fMift valuation, which would yield $3.500,
l'lus revenue from other sources, $1,443,515,
' making a total of $4,943,515 for city and
o.unty purposes; to which :i<l(i such Itema
as are probablj outside the pledge. deficits
amounting to $321,000, and for which you
are not responsible; salaries for extra po
lice, $30,600; judgments, Interest and sink
ing fund, approximating $75,000. I esti
mate, therefore, tliii the board can keep
Its pledge and raise the total of these
amounts $5,370,115. As the revenue for
ihe curreni i:-c;il year for city purposes
was $6.089,906 73, a retrenchmeni for the
next fiscal year of $719,791 is necessary.
This will require on your part strict econ
omy, but there is -eason why, at the
same time, any department of the city
government should be crippled, because
you will find on Investigation a surplus
number of employes i" many departments
ami many employes who do not give the*
time for which they are paid to the city.
There is this much elasticity In our fiscal
system, however, thai the same revenue
may be derived by Increasing ihe assess
ment roll and at the same time reducing
the tax rate. There is no limit on this
except that Imposed by law, namely, the
cash value of property subject t>> taxa
tion. The facts arc thai the property
of the small householder is fully assessed,
while the property of the quasi-public
corporations, principally. Is grossly un
dervalued. In a communication to the
Hoard of Supervisors on July it last year
1 showed that seven street railway and
lighting corporations in this city were un
d< rassessed $32,721,199. That represented
| the difference between the selling price*
| of their stock and bonds in thp market
and the total valuation of their tangible
property as assessed. This is due to the
failure of the Assessor to properly a.-srss
the franchises of these corporations which
should l>e. valued according to the rule
' upheld by the Supreme Court In the case
of the Sa.n Jos-t <ias Company vs. Jan
uary. As just stated, the Assessor and
this Board of Supervisors are pledged by
Hieir party platforms to this rule, which
will largely increase the assessment roll
and the city's resources.
The Mayor supplemented his message
yesterday with a renewal of his party
pledge and a reiteration of his belief
that the Indicated tax rate Is sufficient.
"I certainly believe," he said, "that a
dollar rate on each $100 of $.".".0,000,000 is
sufficient to maintain the city govern
ment. By this I mean that such taxa
tion is sufficient for the current ex
penses of the government. In this I
contemplate no permanent improve
ments, such as school houses, munici
pal buildings, hospitals and sewer sys
tem. Jf the people of San Francisco
want these permanent improvements
the city should he bonded. It is ab
surd to build a Hall of Justice out of
one year's taxation.
"I believe, therefore, that $H.r.no.nno is
a sum ample for the administration of
the government."
The majority <>f the Board of Super
visors, irrespective of party principles.
were likewise emphatic The opinions
of each member are gfven, as follows:
SUPERVISOR HEYERâ
I propose to live up to the strict let
ter of my pledge. I am convinced that
the dollar-limit method of taxation
will furnish us ample funds on which
to run the local government. It was
"ii thai pledge that we were elected.
Every Supervisor agreed to the propo
sition when he accepted his nomina
tion, and the fact that we were elected
by the people is ample proof that the
clause In our platform relating to the
dollar limit was wholly satisfactory to
them. It the general public should by
i any chance believe that they should be
taxed more than the amount indicated
In our platform, let them lay the bur
di n of the blame on the Republican
[â arty. You can assure the people for
me that I will stand by my pledge.
SUPERVISOR AIGELTINGERâ
You may quote me as Baying that I
am strongly in favor <>f a dollar tax
limit. It was a pledge I took when I
received my nomination and I d<> not
propose to break it. I am in favor of
everything that is for the best'inter
ests of the people, and as they have
expressed their desire f.>r a tax levy
of one dollar "ii a $350,000,000 basis, T
pmp.. so to carry nut their wishes. The
matter is one of momeni and has occu
pied my mind for some time. I earnest
ly believe that the affairs of the city
and county can be adequately adminis
tered on that amount. When the mat
ter is brought up in board I will stand
by my pledge to my party's platform
and to the will ..f the people.
SUPERVISOR ATTRIDGEâ
1 think 1 ran express the feeling of
the entire board when I say that we
all favor the dollar limit. Personally I
believe we can even get below that
amount, and I intend doing my utmost
to do it. The matter of taxation is one
in which all citizens are vitally inter-
ested, and when they elected us to of
flce it was upon the understanding that
we would cany out their desires. The
platform of the Republican party fav
ored a dollar limit, and as 1 pledged
myself to uphold its planks I will not
at this late day prove false to the
pledge I gave when given the nomina
tion.
SUPERVISOR PERRAULTâ
I went before the people pledged t'>
give thorn a $1 tux limit on $350,000,000,
and having i>oen chosen to cany oul
their behests I for one intend doing
?<â >. l believe that the municipality can
be run on the amount to be obtained
by a $1 tax limit cm a basis of $350,000,
--000. pins the revenues from other
sources, which will amount to about
$1,443,000. 1 appreciate the danger of a
crisis in Â£!>!:,.â  of the* departments of
thp city government, but think they
may be -avoided by strict economy in
public Improvements. If those crises
do come the Supervisors should not be
blamed, us they arc only carrying out
the expressed wishes of their constitu
ents in giving them tho $1 tax limit.
SUPERVISOR LACKMANNâ
I pledged myself to stand by the plat
form of the Republican party, which
expressly provided for a $1 tax limit
on a basis of $350,000,000. and T propose
keeping my promise. I am of the opin
ion that the affairs of the municipality
can be. run on that basis. I feel that
there are a lot of outside improvements
needed, but if these improvements can

SUPERVISOR PHELPSâ
The $1 tax limit on $350,000,000 is
agreeable to me. Judging by Assessor.
1 >odge's statement the assessment could
be raised and the percentage lessened.
I am perfectly willing to do so-. If it is
not done 1 am willing to abide by the
platform of my party and vote for the
best interests of the people.
SUPERVISOR BLACKâ
I have not fully made up my mind on
the subject, but It would seem to me
that a $1 tax limit on the amount men
tioned would be the proper thing. The
matter is an important one and I wish
to examine Into it more thoroughly be
fore expressing my views. I will be
better able to say something in the
matter within a short time, when T will
bo more conversant with the subject.
You can say. however, that I will vote
for whatever will be for the hnnotit of
San Francisco.
SUPERVISOR KALBENâ
There are lots of improvements to be
made within the present year, and 1 ani
afraid that if we limit ourselves to
$::,noo,ooo we will not he able to" carry
on the affairs of the municipality and
mako th^se improvements. I therefore
am not in favor of limiting ourselves to
the sum mentioned, as it is likely t"
be insufficient. With a. $5,000,000 taxa
tion wo could easily do it. I am per
fectly willing to stand by the plat
form of my party, but I am puzzled
to know how we are g"ing to carry out
its plank. However, you can say that
I will be governed by the sentiment of
my fellow members, and will also have
the best wishes of my party and the
People in mind when I vote on the tax
levy.
SUPERVISOR HOLLANDâ
I intend to stand by the people ami
live up to the platform on which they
elected me. I firmly believe that wo
can raise enough money on which to
conduct of local affairs by taxing
property on the dollar limit basis on an
assessed valuation ..f $350,000,000.
SUPERVISOR COLLINSâ
Pamn it; don't bother me. I am
busy.
SUPERVISOR BYINGTONâ
During the campaign 1 stated to the
people I addressed that I stood square
ly upon th^ platforms to which 1 had
pledged myself. The platform of the
Democratic and the non-partisan party
declared In favor of a one-dollar rate
upon a three hundred and fifty million
dollar valuation. I intend to abide
strictly by this pledge and will under
no conditions vote for a rate to. exceed
that amount. I d<> not countenance the
proposition that a candidate for office
<an go before the people and pledge
himself to a. particular line of conduct
and then when in office declare that an
emergency has arisen that justifies him
p>iiiK beyond his pledge â for example,
exceeding the one-dollar limit. I know
of no such crisis having arisen during
the last year and will certainly live up
to my pledge, as 1 have endeavored to
live up to every pledge made at the
time of my nomination.
I believe that if in the letting of con
tracts and in the furnishing of supplies
to this city strict economy was the
watchword, the legitimate expenditures
could be provided for by keeping with
in the one-dullar limit, taking into con
Hales.
i sideration the income from ither
sources. I for one am ready to labor
to see that they do n<>t exceed the
pledge that all Supervisors made to the
citizens of this municipality. At the
same time, I stand for public improve
ments and desire to see this city beau
: tified in every manner possible, hut in
the beautifying the city let its public
j servants keep economy In view anel the
j interest of the taxpayer.
| SUPERVISOR DEASYâ
When I went before the people for
election they were given to understand
that I would oppose any proposition

SAN FRANCISCO STATE
NORMAL SCHOOL PLUM
TRUSTEES MAY ELECT PRESI
DENT TO-NIGHT.
Numerous Applicants for the Posi
tion Are Anxiously Waiting
to Learn Their Fate.
The new San Francisco State Xorma\
School will be organized to-night if State
Superintendent of Public Instruction Kirk
arrives to-day, as expected, to attend a
meeting of the recently appointed trus
tees.
The Board of Trustees recently organ
ized with S. C. Denson as president and
U. G. \v. LÂ»inkelspiel as secretary. Since
then they have been talking over plans
for the new educational institution and
wrestling: with the many applicants for
the "presidency." as the prlncfpalship of
of the State Normal School is termed in
the latest law. The president of the
State Normal School is to be elected to
night if Mr. Kirk arrives, and many am
bitious and anxious candidates await tho
result of the meeting.
Rumor makes it seem likely that the
plum will go to one of three of the appli
cants. These are: Fred Burk. president of
the State Teachers' Association, whoso
last and recently vacated position was
principal of the schools of Santa Barbara;
Mr. Chllds the former well-known prin
cipal of the Shu Jose. State Normal
School, and R. H. Van Horn, principal of.
the Vacaville High School. Miss Laura
Fowler, so long principal of the old San
Francisco Normal School, which the new
State institution succeeds, Is also one of
the aspirants with strong influences at
her bark. If she is not made the presi
dent she will likely become one of the in
structors. _ r _,
Among the other candidates are w . TV.
Anderson of AJameria. Washington Wil
