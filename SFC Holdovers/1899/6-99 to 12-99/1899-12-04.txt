BOERS MASS FOR THE
DECISIVE STRUGGLE
Determined to Prevent the Passage of
Tugela River by Their Foes.
British Troops Must Construct a Pontoon Bridge
Under Fire Before the Crossing of the
Stream Can Be Effected.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York Herald. Copyright, 1899, by James Gordon Bennett.
LONDON, Dec. 4. â There is still a lull in war news. This morning one interesting item is to
the effect that the Boer> ha.i a very bad time at Kimberley on Tuesday. One of their laagers
was captured by Bechnanana land police. Kimberley is now in searchlight communication
pith the relief force at Modder River.
Prom Xatal we hear that on Tuesday the enemy was located at Chievely Station, on the
railway between Frere and Colenso. The general body of Boers fell back on Colejiso and crossed
the river.
It would *eem that the ?reat railway bridge was scientifically destroyed. The Boers are
massed in strength along I on the north of the Tegula River, which they evidently
intend : . ! .it all that it will become necessary to construct a pontoon bridge for
the pa^aqe of the RritiÂ«Â«h troops This operation, unless the enemy be first dislodged by supe
rior artillery, will ha\;e tÂ«Â« be performed under tire and in the midst of considerable difficulties.
It n<>w seems probable that General Clery is working around the enemy's flank by way of
- nen, in which case the Roers may be placed in a very awkward position. Two more batteries
of artillery and two more battalions of infantry have reached Durban. General Clery must now
have at . ;.000 men. counting in the Xatal Volunteers. With General White's o;oo this
makes a tots 500 British troops in Xatal.

and is sure of assistance from the beleaguered town wherever and whenever he chooses to have a

incident. The Boers have fallen back from Molteno.
The transport Lismore. \v:th artillery on board, has been wrecked. All the men are safe, but
the hordes, and. it is feared, the guns, may be lost.
Two thousand rebel Dutch fanners have joined the Boers in the northeast of Cape Colony.

la the announcement that President

and from that time until she was aban

water in her hold. The weatli.r was very
heavy, high southeast Rales, with a heavy
sea. being encountered constantly. On
November 5 a hurricane blew from the
southeast. Many sails were carrt.'l aw iv
and the water In the hold was Increased
to four feet. The crew were utterly ex
hausted by constant pumping. <>n the
morning of the 6th the cl In plates on the
port side were carried away, and toon
afterward the carpenter came rushlni;
forward and announced that the bark mis
foundering A glance into the hold allowed
the now terrified crew that the water was
rising rapidly and after gathering
a few clothes and tossing a t.at; of
bread into the ships boa', they hurriedly
cut it from the davits, and scrambling
into it abandoned the sinking bark.
In the hurry to get away, so preat war
their terror, they forgot to put fresh wa
ter In the boat. When they le.>. the vessel
she was about sixty miles off Cap.' Cook,
near which place the shipwrecked mÂ»n
landed after an awful struggle with the
ocean, a heavy gale blowing from the
southeast. They were two days In the
open boat, during which timo .ill they bad
to eat was a few pieces of sour bread.
Their tongues were nlmost split with
thirst and one man was almost driven to
madness by drinking from the sea. When
they ultimately jjnt ashore after a hard
struggle through the breakers caused by
the heavy ground swells which always
prevail or. the island coast, they wero
without food, for what they had was lost
In the effort to get ashore. After landing
they abandoned the boat and started out
through the woods in search of settlers.
They were three days climbing over t lie
rocks, wading creeks and cutting their
way through the woods without a bite to
eat before assistance, was found. They
came upon three prospectors on the 11th
and the miners shared their provisions
and clothes with them. Then the DTDS*
pectors started out with them In their
boat for Quatslno, at which place the
steamer called and took them on board.
The crew of the schooner Hera did not
suffer from the lack of food so much M
did the BMn of the Llbertad. but they had
a closer escape from death. It was only
j by running at full spcÂ«-d under all the
canvas they could carry In a storm. In
which at another time they would have
run under closely reefed sails, that they
managed to reach the land in time to es
cape from the burning ship.
The Hera sailed from Seattle on Novem
ber 18, with a full cargo of general mer
chandise for Honolulu. She had on
board 1800 barrels of lime. 750 bales of hay.
considerable bottled beer, two carloads of
tin goods, one carload of canned k.Â»mJ^,
ten pianos, wheat, etc.

THE SEATTLE SCHOONER HERA.
Sunday -morning: smoke was seen coming
from the lower hold. She had sprung a
leak and the lime had ignited, setting fire
to the cargo. A heavy southeaster was
lashing the seas mountains high and the
vessel was under a close-furled mainsail.
There was nothing but to run for It and
trust to Providence, for none knew
whether it would "be two minutes or two
days before the flames would spring from
the hold. Captain Warren put the Hera
about and endeavored to get into the
straits. The heavy winds, however, car
ried the schooner up the island coast.
None knew the coast, but when off Clayo
qot they saw an opening and ran for it.
They were twenty-five hours in reaching
the land, and that time was one of ter
rible suspense. It was just forty minutes
after they had left the vessel a mile from
the shore that the flames shot out, and In
live minutes the vessel was a sheet of
fire, showing by what a narrow margin
they had escaped.
Miss Shirk, the owner's daughter, the
sailors say. was a heroine. She was on
deck the whole of the trying time, cheer-
Ins the crew. The vessel burned to the
water's edge and sank In fourteen
fathoms of water.
The rescued sailors of the Hera are
endeavoring to find out the Identity of a
three-masted topmast schooner, lumber
laden, which passed out on Sunday morn
ing and which they say ignored the!- sig
nals for assistance. The schooner was
about two and a half miles away, and
although they flew their jack union down,
a red blanket in the main rigging, and a.
red table cloth In the forward rigging, no
attention was paid whatever.

This article provided that "whenever In the opinion of thedtJovcrnment of
the United States the coming of Chinese laborers to the United State*, or
their residence therein affects or threatens to affect the Interests of that
country, or to endanger the good order of said country or any locality within

this city against the seating of Brlgham
H. Roberta as a Representative from
Utah culminated In a largely attended
mass-meeting in the First Congregational
Church this afternoon. As many promi
nent clergymen of Washington as were
in a position to be present occupied seats
on the platform or in the audience. Dr.
JoKiah Strong, president of the League
for Social Service of New York, under
the auspices of which the meeting was
held, presided. Addresses were made by
Rev. Randolph H. McKim. rector of Epi
pluiny Church; Rev. Dr. Frank M. Bris
tol, pastor of the Metropolitan lurch;
Rev. Dr. ri. ..I Newman, First Congrega
tional Church, and M. F. Schroeder of
Salt Lake City. Several Salt Lake City
clergymen were present, including Dr. T.
C. Illff. superintendent of the Methodist
miff-lons in Utah: Rev. C. L. Martin, a
lTesbyterlan of Salt Lake City, and Dr.
Sarah J. Elliott, wno has lived in Utah
as a Â«lÂ»uconnesÃ in the Episcopal church
for Mven years. Dr. Illff. as president of
a committee In the Methodist church, was
appointed to oppose the eeating of Mr.
Roberts and to disseminate information
in various parts of the country. He has
.lust compM.-d a tour which Included
most of tho States between Maine and
Florida.
Dr. Strong briefly outlined the object
of the meeting v follow?: "We are here
to protest against the representative of
an alien to civilization taking his peat
in our next Congress. We are met to
l>r<itÂ»-Â«t against admitting among our law
makers a man who is on acknowledged
lawbreaker. We are Democrats. Repub
licans. Methodists. Presbyterians. Bap
tists, Episcopalians and others, but are
not mot as BUob. We are here to Join
hands in protecting the sanctity of the
home and thus preserving the life of the
nation. We are not here to oppose the
Mormon religion, only so far as the re
ligion of the Mormons affect the politi
cal interest of one of the United States.
We believe It to be necessary to make It
a crime against the United States. In
order to do so we must have an amend
ment to the constitution. This legisla
tion is. in fact, the llrst step."
SENATE FORECAST.
Financial Measure Among the First
To Be Introduced.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 3.â The flr?t week
In the Senate will doubtless be marked by
considerable lethargy as usual, On Mon
day the new Senators' will be sworn In,
but beyond this noil. will be done. The
receipt of the President's message will be
postponed for a day out of respect to the
memory of the late Vice President.
On Tuesday little will be done beyond
the receipt of the message, immediately
after which, according to the present pro
gramme, an adjournment will be had to
giv*< the Republican Senators an oppor
tunity to hold a caucus over the organ
ization of the committees. â¢ Wednesday
and Thursday will be devoted largely to
the Introduction of bills. There probbably
will be no session either Friday or Satur
day.
Among the flwt bills to be Introduced
will l>e the rtnaclal measure prepared by
the Republican members of the Finance
Committee. It will be offered by Senator
Aldri'-h and will be referred to the whole
Finance Committee, including the Demo
cratic members.
Up to d:ite only one Senatorial appoint
ment has been made by any Governor.
This is in the case of Senator Quay, but
if he Is seated there will be an effort to
fill the vacant seats from Utah. California
and Delaware by the same methods.
There Is unusual Interest In Mr. Quay's
cape, and both his friends and opposing
Senators are already working zealously.
Mr. Quay will make no effort to be seated
on Monday.

GREAT GAINS
Says Democracy Will

VESTo.V Tex.. Dee. Hon. W.
J. Br>-an. who Is hero with ex-Governor
H<KÂ«C on an outing, spoke to-day at some
length of next year's campaign. Mr.
Bryan states that the Democrats will
make great gains next year among large
classes of people.
"These people comprise the wage earn
ers." said he. "This. who have been di
rectly affected by the consolidation of
the great manufacturing concerns of the
country, commonly railed trusts. In this
class Is enumerated day laborers, ofllce
men. drummers, etc. These are the peo
ple who will vote with the Democrats
next year.
â  With a continuation of such an In
crease to our side for the next twelve
months. It will not be a question of
whether or not the Democrats can win.
but how large thÂ«> majority will be. I
have no fear for the outcome. The recent
elections to un unbiased mind plainly In
dicate that the Democrats had the better
of It In nearly all States In which elec
tions were held. In Ohio. Mr. McKlnley's
homo State, Is the Democratic gain more
dearly shown than those anywhere else
except In Maryland and Nebraska. The
vote given Jones was anti-Republican,
and had be not been In the race. It most
umtrcdly Â» iuld have rone to McLean.
Next year, with th'c present ratio of In
crease. Ohio will go Democratic by a safe
majority.
"The Republicans would like, to cover
m*> with the plory of personally winning
Ibe fU-M In Nebraska. They would If
por-Flble. lead tho people to believe that
thÂ»re was no Issues In this election, and
that I was sn personally magnetic as to
lrud the people to the , Us with noth
ing more than myself as an incentive.
The truth of the matter Is the people of
Nebraska have been awakened. They
realize that it Is tim that a change was
being made In the administration of the
affairs of he Government, and they pro
p&fe to throw off the yokÂ« of â  flngle
money standard, a militarism and to
check the avarice and greed that has
almost become the objective of that
party. And not only In Nebraska Is that
the case, but I tlr.d from both personal
Investigation and from th' -. who are In
a position to know that the people In
many sections of other States heretofore
strongly Republican have made up their
minds to Join the free silver forces next
year."

John J. Reed was born at the l*rÂ«.sidi'> on
July li', USJ7, and was brought to Matin
County when only a month old. His
father was riven charge of the old Mis
sion San Rafael, and for that reason re
ceived one of the largest grants of land
ever Issued to a resident of Marin County
by the Mexican Governmentâ over 2000
acres.
When the father died all this land was
bequeathed to his son. The most of it is
rich farming and grazing country lying
between Hilaritn and Reeds station. Reed
later acquired â  gocd deal of land In the
vicinity of Mill Valley, which of late
yeiirs i.a* been used principally for cattle
raising'. A few days prior to his decease
Reed sent for City Attorney Boyd and ex
ecuted a deed of gift In favor of his son
and his wife. Carlotta. by which they
were given possession of 1320 acres of rich
dairy land, valued at JiriO.OOO. A day later
the old man came to the conclusion that
the end was near and again Bent for

So far as the concession granted to the

Nicaragua is known to be quite willing

published a report on the visit made by
the delegates of the company to the
isthmus, where they inspected the works
and studied the best way to finish the
work begun. The report makes full com
parison between the Panama and Nicara
gua routes, and says:
"The Nicaragua canal would pass right
through the volcanic district. Earth
quakes are frequent In the neighborhood
and have several times destroyed the
cltiea of Leon and Grenada. The pro
jected Nicaragua route coincides with
the line cf the transversal fracture par
ticularly liable to such visitations."
The report says the work and material
handed over by the Panama company Is
in a good state of preservation. The
plans which have been adopted Involve
the removal of about 24.700,0uQ cubic me
tres of earth, for the whole cutting of
which 11,200.000 are necessitated by Cu
lebra Mountain. There are now HOI men
on the works. In the first year of active
work the number will have to be raised
to 5000. and there will be as many as 10,
000 at the time of maximum activity. The
number of men engaged must average
12,000 during a period of ten years as
signed for the complete excavation of the
work.
Following is a summary of the ex

execution of the plan:
For work of cutting, 242.000.w0 francs:

LONG RECOMMENDS THE
BUILDING OF NEW SHIPS
In His Annual Report the Secretary
Points Out Ways of Improving
the Service.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.-The annual re
port Of St cretary of the Navy
which has just been made publli\ r
raeadi ti.at Congrwi be raqtMsMd tr au
thorize the construction of the following
vessels:
Firstâ Three armored crullers of about
13,0u0 tons trial displacement, of a maxi
mum draught at deep load not to exceed
26 feet, carrying the heaviest armor an<l
most powerful ordnance for vessels of
their class, to be sheathed and coppered
and to have the highest practicable speed
and great radius of action.
Secondâ Twelve gunboats of about 900
tons trial displacement, to bo sheathed
and coppered.
Thirdâ Three protected cruisers of about
SOOO tons trial displacement, earning the
most powerful ordnance for vessels of
their class, to be Hheathed and coppered,
and to have the highest practicable speed
and great radius of action.
The increase In the tonnage of the last
three named \essels from 6000 tons, as
recommended v year ago, to SiwO tons Is
suggested by the Naval Board on Con
struction aa better adapted to the present
needs of the service. The same board Is
also of the opinion that if any of the fort
going vessels are authorized, the law
should provide that In case satisfactory
bids cannot be obtained for tholr con
struction by contract, the department
shall have authority to construct the
same in the navy yards.
In the opinion of the department, the re
port continues, it would be In tl
of good business organization an<l econ
omy to consolidate the three Bureaus of
trUCtlon and Repair, Steam
. , iipmeiu undti
Each of these bureaus has now. durrg
the construction of naval vessels, it ,
iir.tt" inspectors at each yard. A consoli
dated bureau could, of course, be run
much cheaper than three bureaus and a
tjr*.-a.t savinti nia'ie by a reduction of Ihe
now three separate working forces, both
clerical and mechanical. y In
navy yards. Fewer naval ottii-ert* would
be needed, as there would be but one
staff Instead of three, so that more offi
cers would be available for other duty.
Attention Is invited to the recommenda
tion of the Chief of the Bureau of Yards
and Docks that the grade of assistant
civil engineer be established in addition
to that of civil engineer, and that the
number of officers In the corps of Civil
Engineers be Increased to thirty. At pres
ent the corps Is composed of twenty-one
officers, all of the grade of civil engineer.
This number is not sufficient for the
proper conduct of the work of designing,
building and maintaining the public works
of the navy. There are at present four
graving docks of the largest size and one
steel dock under construction, and others
may bo authorized. Many new buildings
aru lao in process or contemplation of
construction at the various navy-yards,
and a number of new yard* established in
our recently ilred possessions de
mand the attention of a civil engineer.
The duties devolving upon the Bureau of
Yards and Docks, therefore, have been
greatly Increased, and a larger staff of
civil engineers Is necessary If a proper
supervision Is to be maintained over the
Important Improvements, which require
careful watching while In progress and
constant attention after completion.
Several of the foreign built vessels that
were bought by the department during
the Spanish-American war were after
ward offered for sale, as provided by
law, and bid upon, but were subsequently
withdrawn from sale, owing to the fact
that the Treasury Department, acting In
accordance with an opinion of the Attor
ney General, refused, although the bid
ders were American citizens, to grant reg
istry in such cases on the ground that
the statutes governing such matters ex
cluded them trom the privileges granted
to vessels of domestic build.
Therefore, In order that purchasers of
vessels of the kind referred to may be
given the benefits of the shipping laws.
It la necessary that Congress, if it ap
proves of such action, enact a measure
providing that nil vessels hereafter
bought by American citizens from the
Government, no matter where built or
how procured by It, shall be entitled by
virtue of such purchase to all the rights
and privileges allowed by law to vessels
built In the United States.
The department submitted a bill to the
last Congress for the organization of a
national naval reserve, which It is hoped
will be enacted Into law during the com
ing session. The navy afloat has In
creased to such an extent as to make it of
great importance that there should be a
reserve upon which to call in time of war.
The officer in charge of the naval militia
In his annual reports makes certain rec
ommendations in this connection, to
which attention Is Invited. It Is deemed
to lie very important that % h a reserve,
representing the whole country and re
lated directly to the national naval es
tabllsment. snould be fostered and made
ready for call.
The department approves the recom
mendation of the Burgeon general that
provision be made to transfer the eighteen
or nineteen volunteer assistant surgeons
who served during the Spanish war and
are still In the service, to the regular
navy, without limitation as to age. This
Increase In the medical corps is made nec
essary by reason of the large increase in
the number of enlisted men In the navy
and marine corps, made at the last ses
sion of Congress, and the establishment
of new hospitals in the recently acquired
possessions.
Attention Is called to the recommenda
tion of the chief of the Hureau of Equ'n
ment and the hydrographer of that nu
reau that the Hydrographlc Office be au
thorized by Congress to construct charts
of our own coast on the Mercator pro
jection. Under the law. as at present
the work of charting the coasts and wa
ters of the United States Is performed by
the Coast and Geodetic Survey of the
Treasury Department. The department
believes that the work of charting the
wa'ers of the United States should proo
erlv be done by the Hvdrographlc Office
of the Navy Department.
The report declares that thÂ© most Im
portant question pertaining to naval con
struction at the present time and one
that demands prompt attention Is that
of the armor for vessels now building
and for others authorized hut not yet
contracted for on account of the provisfjn
In the act of March 3. 1599, prohibiting
the department from contracting for the
vessels therein authorized until contract
has been made for the armor therefor
within $300 a ton. The price fixed Is one
for which even Inferior armor can not
be obtained and the department has
therefore been unable to Invite prop^als
for the three battleships and the thrÂ»C
armored cruisers authorized by the act
of March 3, IS9O.
It is urgently recommended that n the
early days of Its next session Congress
enact such special legislation, by Joint
resolution or otherwise, as may be ne
cessary to enable the department to make
contract! tarty In the coming year for
730S tons of armor of the best qunUty
that can be obtained in this country f>r
the Maine. Ohio, nnd Missouri, and thÂ»t
the provision of the act of March 3. ISM.
limiting the price of armor to $.- - per
ton .and the. restriction preventing the
armored vessels therein authorized from
being contracted for until the armor
therefor Is contracted for be removed.
Regarding reward of officers the report
says:
The department renews Its recommendations
of hint year for a change In the present law for
rewarding* officer* for conspicuous conduct In
battle and for extraordinary heroism. The In
justice of the present sytitem Is apparent. The
promotion of an officer over the heads of other
officers operates as a reduction of the latter
In rank and also delays them In securing the
lncreaÂ»ed pay which accompanies regular rise
In nt-ad^. In other words, the promotion Is
made not at the expense of the Government,
which should hear It. .but at the expense .if the
unfortunate officer* who are overslaughed and
who are thus punished, although faithful to
every duty and only unfortunate In lacking the
opportunity for conspicuous conduct or heroism.
The spirit of the navy Is so good that I am
sure this la painful to the officer promoted as
well a* the officer reduced. The department
therefore again urges that legislation be enact
ed providing that advancement In rank for
services " rendered during the war with Spain
shall not Interfere with the regular promotion
of officers otherwise entitled to promotion, and
that officers *o. advanced to hicher Km by
reason of war service shall be carried as addi
tional to the numbers In each grnd<Â» to which
they have been promoted. The department sub
mltted to Congress at Its last session a bill
substantially to this effect, which Is printed as
Senato bill No. 6006. and to which attention Is
invited.
While, those engaged in the battle of Manila
fear* been dascrvedijr rewardedâ and no cea
ever deserved reward more richlyâ those who took
part in the operations at displaying
the same conspicuous conduct and â¢ v.ra.. r'..
nary heroism, have received no recognition
whatever for their great service* except the
recommendations lor promotion by the IÂ«resf
dent, which have lapsed, not having been acted
upon by the Senate.
The department believes It due to these tat
lant men to suggest to you that their services
be recognized and equal Justice done them, and
that. in accordance with the statute In such
cases made and provided, you recommend that
the thanks of Congress be given to the com
mander-ln-chlef of the North Atlantic squad
ron and to the officers an 1 men under h!a com
mand, as they were given in the case of thÂ«
commander-ln-chlef and officers a:. men of th>
Asiatic squadron. The North Atlantic squad
ron was charged with great and exacting du
ties. Including the blockade of Cuba, co-opera
tion with the army, and the pursuit. blockade
nr.l capture or destruction of the Ppanlan
c<iundron under Admiral Cervera. all of which
It discharged with signal efficiency. It wu .1
campaign of great scope and enormous respons
ibilities, and was brought .to a successful an)
glorious consummation, which terminated the
war by the destruction of the Spanish â¢Â«â¢
power. It was marked by unsurpassed preci
sion, brilliancy and vigor. That the men who
by such achievements earned their country*
tr.uifi !â¢â¢ have received no reward from its
Government Is an omission which It cannot be
doubted will be cordially and generously re
paired.
If reward by the present system of promotion
Is abandoned, us above suggested, the depart
ment renewa UÂ» BUSKÂ«stI->n nnbodi**! to B<nat^
bill Â£005, Introduced at the last session of Con
gress, which provide* for medals of three
classes one for conspicuous conduct In war.
one for extraordinary heroism and one for gen
eral meritorious serviceâ the first to carry with
It a percentage of Increase of pay. based upon
the rank of the recipient and calculated to [.v*
the piure of the Increase which would be the
result of promotion were that form of rnÂ»trl
continued. It li believed that such a medal,
worn during life and transmitted aÂ« an Inherit
ance, will be far more grateful to a deserving
officer than a promotion In rank at the expense
of a comrade.
Regarding the Mare Island navy-yard,
the report says:
The Importance of rhe Mare Island Navy
yard has been greatly Increased by our recent
acquisitions In the Pac!9c Ocean.
The principal Items of expenditure here dur
ing the pas: year have been for re

to-morrow the State Board of Election
Commissioners of Kentucky will meet to

no one can predict with accuracy tho de

board. The certified turns from the
county boards, now on tile with the Sec

of :M3o, but the Democrats declare that
many of these votes will be thrown out

capable of diverse ruction, and the

November la the Yaquis and the Mexican
military fortes have had sevoral en^age
nieiits. attended with loss of life and a
number of wounded. The first of their en
gagements was on November 18. Juot
north of Cocori, and during the engage
ment there were forty-eight Indiana and
live soldiers killed outright. In ad iitlon
thereto twonty-three soldiers wore wound
ed and something over a hundred squaws
uinl Indian children captured by the mill
t.Â»jy forces. These prisoners will be sent
to Guaymaa by the military authorkws
to hold i? boatacm. Tti<Â« place where this

gaged them. The lighting was very se
vere and lasted most of the day. The
Indians were finally put to flight and this
explains why so many of their woven

in dire confusion and the women became

CUBAN PRESS ON
SECRETARY ROOT'S REPORT
Agents of a Big Plantation, Fearful
of an Uprising, Place Armed
Men on Guard.
HAVANA. Dec. âThe Patrla. discuss
ing the references to Cuba In Secretary
Root's report, pronounces these "very sat
isfactory," and says that "Independence
is safe."
The Nuevo Pals says: "The Americans
evidently still believe that the Cubans are
not lit to govern themselves, owing to
their lack of education, and they still in
tend to educate us until we are fit for
self-government. Mr. Root does not dis
cuss the question of Independence, leav
ing it where it was on January Ist."
The Havana Commercial Company has
placed armed guards on its plantations in
the province of Plnar del Rio. and will
apply to Governor General Brooke for an
infantry contingent. Mr. Merry-Lees, the
manager, says: "The company would not
Co to the expense of arming a number of
men unless this was thought necessary for
the protection of its interests. We do not
believe there is any immediate cause for
alarm, but we do consider that the spirit
of disaffection is spreading, and is liable
sooner or later, to burst into flame when
ever the United States Government .does,
or refrains from doing, something which
the Cuban leaders oppose or desire "

Berlin Money Market Agitated Over
the Advance in the Bank of
England's Money
Rate.
Bp^rial Dispatch to The Call.
BERLIN. Dec. 3.â The Government has
been expecting that the growth of the em
pire's revenue would yield the funds re
quired by Emporor William's naval pro
ject, thus avoiding additional taxation.
In this possibility is the chief ground for
the Government's hope of carrying the
naval bill. If. however, the present de
crease In receipts continues the pa.Â«s;iÂ£Â»
of the bill will be imperiled. For several
months there has been relative or abso
lute decrease, that for October being 3.
500.000 marks, when the receipts for the
month are compared with those of Octo
ber last year. The Government had ex
pected an Increase of 30,000,000 marks an
nually, but the total increase during the
last nine months has been only 500,000.
The opposition newspapers foreshadow a
strong insistence upon those facts when
the bill comes up fur consideration.
Empress Frederick has Just purchased
the Villa Brenzonia, on the promontory

of the most beautiful views.

The advance of the Rank of England's
rate dominates tho attention of the Berlin
money market. At first it was sup;
that this would have no Immediate effect
here, the British balances having been
much reduced of lat.-. but since London
exchange h;ia already shown a rising
tendency, the market reckons with the
possibility that the Relchsbank will soon
raise Its rate to 7 per cent. This unpre
cedented rate would weigh heavllv upon
trade and Industry and would s<>on se
verely check the business boom. The near
approach of London exchange to the gold
point yesterday has Increased the fear of
gold exports.
The Bt&tement of the Reichshank
showed Increased li^-ounts to the amount
of 25.300.000 marks, and a loss of metal to
the amount of 1P.G00.4u0 marks. It In much
more unfavorable than the statement for
the corresponding date last year. Great
pressure Is expected toward* tho end of
the month.
Tho effect of money on market condi
tions has thus far been confined to a
slight weakening In industrial sharos. Re

INDIANS IN WANT.
Subscriptions Taken for Benefit of
Unfortunates on Warner's Banch.
PASADENA, Dec. 3 âMajor H. N. Rust
of this city, formerly Indian agent, has
been interesting himself In the natives of
Warner's Ranch, San Diego County. Ho
says the past dry season haa Impoverish
ed the Indians very much, as they de
pend largely upon the barley crop, which
ha-s well nigh failed them. Public sub
scriptions are now being taken for their
benefit and so that they may enjoy a
Christmas tree. The history of 'Warner's
Ranch has recently taken a turn of Inter
est. Aku.i Callente. or Warner's Ranch
occupies an elevated plain about two by
three miles in extent and supports 10.1^0
head of cattle. Don Warner received his
title from the Mexican Government nnd
later It passed into the hands of Governor
Downey, deceased. In early days the In
dians were useful as laborer*, so they
were allowed to stay. When the native's
uwoke to the realization that their lands
were being gobbled they made a feeble
resistance. The California courts decided
that the heirs of the Downey estate have
a right to dispossess them. Among these
are J. Downey Harvey and the relatives
of Peter D. and Andrew Martin.
The Indians' Rights Association, an
Eastern organization, has taken up the
side of the aborigines and has recently
secured the co-operation of the Depart
ment of Justice at Washington. As a
result legal defense has be?n appointed
for the Indians and the District Attorney
has been Instructed to sue out a writ of
error and to co-operate with the attorney
for the Indians In the appeal of the case.
The hot springs, aqua <alle n tes. on these
lands, make them valuable, and in all
probability the fight for their possession
will be a lively one. Mrs. Jo*ephtuÂ» 11.
Habbltt Is now teacher of the school at
Warner's Ranch. I'ntll her arrlv; ', the
Indians celebrated the Independen % c of
Mexico and recognized the Mexican flag
only.

believed he also received a kick. Mr. Can
iieifi became unconscious and blood flowed
profusely from his mouth and nose. His
family phys.cian and two others were
summoned. It is believed that his skull
has been fractured, but owing to the
swelling the physicians will not be able
to ascertain the exact condition for some
hours. Ills right arm was also broken In
three places.
Dr. Otto stated late thin afternoon that
no signs of consciousness had been seen
and that his condition was most serious,
and expressed little hope of a recovery.

There arc other signs, however, that the enormous

further advance in hardware is reported at a number
cf points. There is still a pood demand for woolens,

of larger receipts of hops and wheat continues its

The money situation remains about the same. The
Hank of England has again been obliged to raise its
rute of discount to keep gold from leaving the coun
try, and it is now 6 per cent. It has risen steadily
fium about 3 per cent. In New York the market has
been eased somewhat by the Government purchase of
bonds, the return of money from the West and the
c-tab!uhmentÂ»of a $6,000,000 surplus by the banks, in
stead of the deficit which has been the rule of late. It
i* thought in New York, however, that while a seri
ous monetary stringency is not to be expected, pres
ent indications do not point to any real ease in money
for some little time to come. The tightness is purely
speculative and confined to Wall street, however, as
there have been plenty of funds for commercial pur
poses right along. The bondholders are still sluggish
in Â»eJHng their bonds to the Government, and thus far
less than $20,000,000 of the â  0,000 asked by th?
Treasury Department have been turned in. This
slowness shows two thing*: First, that there is no
financial stringency in trade, and second that the
bondholders know a good thing when they see it
In this city conditions remain about the same.
Husiness is apparently as active as usual at this time of
the year, but from now on until the middle of January
it will probably fall off. as it does everywhere. Some
lines are already quieter, notably dried fruits, pro
visions and grain, the latter being affected by the
steady decline in wheat. The volume of business is
Mill far ahead of the average, however, so no com
plaints are heard from any quarter. The season is
remarkably propitious, as the State has had a general
wetting, enough to worry along on for sixty days
without inconvenience. In fact, dry weather is now
needed by the farmers, as in many sections they are
unable to plow and Â«ow. Agricultural conditions arÂ»
vastly better than at this time last year and a good sea
son is confidently anticipated in consequence.

In selecting Richardson of Tennessee for their
r the Democrats have acted more wisely than
expected and have done about the best they
! under the circumstances. He has been in the
House a long time, and while he is not a strong de
ror is in any way an aggressive fighter, he is
thoroughly familiar with the rules of the House and
with the members of it. Hi* speeches, while not
eloquent, have the merit of being comparatively short.
It has been said of him by Washington correspond
ents, who have watched his course for years, that
while he is not irresistibly genial nor a "mixer." he
knows the .etter and is better known by it
than any other Democrat. It is to that fact probably
he owes his election. Certainly a man of his experi
ence w ill be a safer and a better leader for the minority
than was the erratic Bailey of Texas, or than the elo
quent Seller, Tammany's candidate, would have been
had the New Yorkers succeeded in carrying the
caucus for him.
In the Republican caucus it was a foregone conclu
sion that Henderson would be named for the Speaker
ship and accordingly there is no surprise over the
fact that his nomination waÂ« given by acclamation.
The feature of the caucus wag the collapse of the
.imitation to bring about a change in the rules by
which the House is to be governed. A motion pro
viding for a in don of the rules was made by
Hepburn of lowa and was supported by Reeves of
Illinois, but so strong was the opposition to it that
liter some debate the motion was withdrawn and a
eclaring it to be the 6ense of the
caucus that the Reed rules should be adopted by the
:-e.
One of the cauÂ«e* which impelled the caucus to sus
tain the rules is the slender majority by which the
Republicans will have control of the House. The
had the singular effect of increasing
Kepublica- .in the Senate and decreasing it
in the House. Instead of the majority of fifty
which Reed had at hi* back in the last Congress,
Henderson will have hardly more than ten over the
combined Democrats and Populists. It would there
uiifestlj Inexpedient to deprive the Speaker
y power at this time, for he will need all that
can be piven him to enable him to carry through the
important me h are to come before Con
gress.
It is to be noted moreover that the Reed rules,
while depriving members of the House of many of
their old-time privileges of speaking and filibustering,
lias been much more crushing upon the lobby. The
ess of the House is now in the hands of a respon
sible committee and the lobbyist has no longer the

there will be a strong lobby in Washington this win
ter to fight the ' ;a bill, the shipping bill and
the currency and banking bill. That knowledge also
had much to do in determining Republicans to keep
to the rules, which have proven effective in the past
against the machinations of that class of people.
Judging then by the results of the caucusing the
outlook for the session is good. We shall probably
have a business Congress and one as free from merely

THE END OF T^E KHfU-IFA.
SEETHING oi the sublime is to be found in
the Â«t<>r> that comes to us oi the <ieath of the
Khalifa Â»" the desert! oi the Soudan. Undis
mayed by the fearful slaughter at Omdurman, unter
rified by the fate which had struck down the Mahdi,
m, he went forth to battle against
the British, to oppose valor against discipline, faith
Lxim guns and religion M^.*iii-t civilization.
What trust in bil God and his dreams, what soar
death-defying spirit flamed within him as he
marched out to buttle, we know not and shall never
know, for of his race there are no poets to express
the aspirations of kings and of people in words so
luminous that none can mistake their meaning. To
men of our race and of our religion, he will be ever
only a fanatic barbarian, a fool and a sav.ige, who went
the way of madmen and perished like one.
Nevertheless there is an element in the death of
the old leader that appeals to the deeper sentiments of
men crrn in our age of scoffing materialism. He
fought with all the skill and wariness of which he
and his Kmirs were the possessors, M long as the-e
was a chance f<T desert strategy to achieve anything.
Those resources failing, lie trusted to valor and to
strength, and with sword tnd spear attempted to rush
the British lines through a death-dealing hail of bul
let* and shells and cannon balls. When daring was
found to be as futile as caution, and the end was at
hand, the old chief disdained to fly. We are told
he spread n sheepskin on the ground and with his
Emirs around him sat down in front of the British
lire and awaited thr end At the close of the fight he
was found shot through head and heart and arms and
legs, literally rid'lled with bullets, and his Emirs lay
, dead around him and his body guard, as faithful as
himself, were dead in front of him.
So cliffs a re'io^us force which haÂ« dominated the
â  n ior upward of twenty years. A force which,
ow.ni- . in to the fervor of an obscure man,
the original Mahdi. si one time threatened to over
run all Northern and Central Africa and did seriously
menace Egypt, thus involving Europe in the strife
and causing those movements on the part of the
British that hive carried Kitchener to the heart of
the Soudan, excited Cecil Rhodes' ambition to con
â¢ a railway from the Cape and Cairo, and thus
indirectly led to the war in the Transvaal
In the sweep of that far-reaching wave of religious
zeal" many remarkable men have been raised high
enough for the world to fee them and to note their
characters well. None of them, however, met death
in a more dramatic or more appropriate manner than
the old Khalifa, with whom the wave subsides and
the story closes. The final scene is a theme for a
great artist of poetic powers. What a personification
of faith in the unseen there is in this attitude of the
old man and his princes and hiÂ» guards, sitting quietly
down on the sands of the desert waiting for death to

THE PfIRK PANHANDLE.
T~) EFORE the growing popular sentiment in favor
\ ci progress and improvement every vestige of
objection to the proposed extension of the park
system ought to die down into the deadness of a mere
silurianism and have no more part in the active life
of the city than the old objections made years ago to
the purpose of establishing Golden Gate Park itself.
The Panhandle is in truth a natural development of
the park, a necessary adjunct to it, connecting it with
the great avenues of the city, and one of the improve
ments most requisite to the work of municipal
progress.
The cost of the extension will be so small when
compared with the benefits derived from it that it
ought not to weigh with any citizen who understands
the difference between economy and parsimony. It
is moreover to be borne in mind that we have just
closed one year of prosperity and arc now upon the
eve of another which has every promise of being
more prosperous than the last. In the very nature ol
things real estate will 6oon take another upward
movement and we shall never again have an oppor
tunity to purchase the lands required for the various
features of the proposed extensions upon anything
like such easy terms. If therefore San Francisco is
ever to have the Mission Park, the Panhandle and the
boulevard connecting the Park with the Presidio,
this is the time to act.
That a large majority of the property-owners, tax
payers and workingmen of the city are in favor of the
improvements is beyond question. The only danger
lies in the fact that to carry the measure it will have
to receive a two-thirds vote, and many progressive
citizens being sanguine of the outcome of the elec
tion may stay away, while the objectors will be sure
to go to the polls to enjoy another opportunity of in
dulging their pet delightâ that of kicking at every
project of municipal improvement.
To obtain the money for the improvements bonds
are to be issued bearing 3 1-3 per cent interest. Every
dollar of the amount will be expended in the city, and,
of course, will set to work earning profits or interest
for those into whose hands it passes. In private hands
it will, of course, earn more than the municipality has
to pay for it, so that while the city will be paying
3 1-2 per cent interest, the money having gone into
circulation will be earning in business and adding to
the general wealth of the community anywhere from
7 per cent up, and the interest charges will therefore
be in no sense a loss.
As for the benefits sure to result from providing
such grand approaches to the Park from the center of
the city at the intersection of Market street and Va 1
Ness avenue, from the Mission and from the Presidio.
they are so apparent that argument concerning them
!is hardly necessary. No community in America or in
Europe has ever regretted money expended for park
purposes. The very men who objected to such pur
' chases have in the end been proud of the parks after
they were opened and adorned. All the progressive
cities of the Union â New York, Boston, Philadelphia.
Chicapo. St. Louis and others â have been wisely lavish
; in providing parks and boulevards and in no instance
has there been a complaint of having too many parks
San Francisco must keep up with other cities. She
stands es the representative American metropolis on
the Pacific and it will not do to lag behind those on
the Atlantic.
GENERAL BULLER'S military censorship over
all reports concerning the progress of the war
in South Africa has been frankly asserted. It
has never been pretended that comprehensive in
fonnatioa regarding the battles or the plans of cam
has been permitted to the public. It appears,
ver, from recent statements in the Westminster
Gazette that the censorship has been applied to mat
ters of politics as well as of war, and that the people
of Cape Colony have we!': founded complaints to
make of the tyranny with which it is enforced.
The Gazette quotes from a letter written by a man
whom it declares to be "of unimpeachable loyalty"
and for whose knowledge of the subject it vouches, a
strong arraignment of the manner in which the
Dutch people of the colony have been treated. The
letter is an appeal to the justice of the better class of
the British people to guard the rights of the Dutch in
Cape Colony. Among other things the writer says:
"Just look at our position. One hundred and
eighty- five meetings were held throughout the colony
protesting against war, and yet these were abso
lutely ignored by the Governor, while every little
league meeting had its resolutions cabled over to the
Secretary of State for the Colonies as the expression
of public opinion here. Now we are not even al
lowed to cable our opinions. Then it is continually
hinted that, when the Free State and Transvaal are
conquered, we shall find our liberties curtailed and
matters so arranged that the newcomers to South
Africa will have the balance of political powers placed
in their hands. The Dutch people have behaved
splendidly through all this trying time, but once let
the opinion become general that their liberties will be
taken away from them and tuch a spirit will be
aroused that it will be the beginning of the end. Now
is the time for all true friends of South Africa to exert
all their influence on prominent politicians in England
to get them really to understand the true position of
affairs out here. We have done all in our power as a
Government and people to preserve the peace of
South Africa. That having been swept away, we are
using all our influence to keep the war from spread
ing into the colony, and you can imagine how diffi
cult this is, with this colony used as the base of
operations against the republics."
This arraignment is the most serious that has been
brought against General Ruller and the Ministry
that supports him. A censorship over reports of
military proceedings, while it may be ill-advisad, is
not in itself unjust and can be readily excused, but
why should the censors deny to the people of Cape
Colony the right of cabling their opinions to London?
The Cape is far removed from the seat of war and
the opinions of the people are not rightly lubject to
military law.
It is well known that if the Dutch people in Cape
Colony should determine to make common cause with
their kinsmen of the Transvaal and Orange Free
State, the difficulties of the British would be vastly
increased. In fact, a general uprising would make a
war of conquest so costly that even the most ardent
rf British imperialists might well shrink from at
tempting to prosecute it. That fact gives a deep
significance to the censorship which Buller has
established over political opinions as well as over war
rews. It may have been designed to prevent the
dissemination of disloyal sentiments among the
Dutch, but it may aUn have the effect of causing the
very thing it was intended to prevent.
In all your talking do not forget to talk of the ad
vantages of the proposed park extension and thut
confirm your friends in a determination to rote for it.
THE BRITISH CENSORSHIP.
MINING BUREAU MIRED.
GAGE AS A GEOLOGIST.
PARALYZED BY POLITICS.
A LAW BY BLACKSMITHS.
The miners of the State will be delight
ed to learn that the State Mining Bu
reau la in an Inchoate and dirty political
mess as the result of a boid but foci
patronage-grabbing play by c few poli
ticians with Governor Gage apparently
playing the rola of chief bandit. This
Important State Institution, from which
the mining Interests rightly expect much,
is paralysed and has been for months, as
mr as its most Important functions so,
as the result of an attack by the r.poils
nien. The bureau has suffered more or
less rrom the curse of practical poll* lrs
before, but now It seems completely mire I
In this familiar slough.

nurcaus at loggerheads with each other

crts with the miners who need IU ai<l
The other is a new one. run by Governor
Gage, fancy free, with $30,000 and all out
doors.
Then there comes Into view In the rear
the Interesting development that this new
gubernatorial bureau of science and In-
Â£ u Â»try Is probably Illegal and that Its
$20,000 will be taken away from It by the
courts Whenever anybody makes a ltg-i!
astault on It. as somebody ls likely to >lo
before it acquires a very long hlitorv.
And while viewing these troubled insti
tutional twins one may hear the poll'i
cal pulls fairly creaking as the mesx
grows more Involved.
This situation has been developed hv
the recent delayed action of Governor
Gags In appointing Stephen Bowers and
W. L. Watts of Los Angeles as field ex
pertg In accordance with the provisions
of the- last appropriation bill supplying
funds for the State Mining Bureau.
It's Just that bill that has made the
trouble. In the last Legislature the rep
resentation of the mining Industry and It-
Influence, through the California Mln rs
Association and otherwise, was strong
and there was no objection to continuing
the $28,000 a year for the support of tho
bureau. But some people thought lhnt
It would never do to let the patr^na*
get away from the Governor and .tls po
litical friends Into the hnnda >f the Dem
ocratic State Mineralogist and the board
of trustees, where It properly belonged.
Keport credits mainly Assemblyman
Valentine of Los Angeles, chairman of
the House Committee on Appropriations,
with the scheme to get away witn th<*
patronage. The general appropriate..'!
Mil as Introduced by Valentine and o;is.Â«<"d
provided $50,000 for the two fls,al years
"for the support of the State Mining Bu
reau." but Included a "provided," etc.
to the effect that $20,000 of this sum shoul 1
lÂ»e spent In scientific and practical exam
inations of the mining districts of the
State. Including the mother lode and oil
regions, this work to be done by compe
tent experts, "to be appointed and their
salary fixed by the Governor."
â¢nmpetcnt scientific and practical f.eM
work is what the mining Interests fcunt.
The thing looked all right from a mMc
away to people not Interested In who got
the Jobs and who didn't go near enough
to smell It or see the bugs In It. Th^
Governor generously favored the miners
with his approval of the measure and
then the year began to age tnd wh-n
July 1 came the miners waited for the
fallows with geological hammers ar.il
notebooks. Late In >Â»ovomber, after live
months of the fiscal year had gone and
the blessed snows and rains had come lo
mountain and foothill, the Governor gave
to the miner? Messrs. Bowers and Watts
>f Los Angeles.
This Is the start of the expenditure of
that $20,000. There has been no announce
ment of how many field experts are to be
appointed, or what they will be paid or
what they are to do. The section of the
appropriation bill at Issue regulates nei
ther the number or salaries of thÂ« "ex
perts." The Governor may apparently
appoint one man at $20,000 a year or a
hundred to work for a few weeks.
When these appointments camo along
the duality of the Mining Bureau showed
up. State Mineralogist Cooper took the
stand that the Governor's employes and
their work was none of his business. He
reasoned that as the law Rave their ap
pointment and compensation into the Gov
ernor's hands they were responsible to the
Governor alone. As executive officer of
tho Mining Bureau he would not be re
sponsible for the work of men over whom
he had no control. Mr. Cooper simply de
clines to know or care anything about Mr.
Bowers or Mr. Watts or anybody else that
Governor Gage makes a field expert. a
nurse In the Stockton Insane Asylum may
IS well send a salary or expense bill to
him or report for Instructions. "Who in
the dickens Is Bowers? He doesn't belong
to the Mining; Bureau." Is the State Min
eralogist's consistent attitude.
So Messrs. Bowers and Watts must re
port for orders to Gage. who. as a mem
ber of the Board of miners, must
audit their bills. So the State Mineralo
gist can't go out and study rocks. Bo Gov
ernor Gage Is at the head of an indepen
dent Institution that he can do as he likes
with. He Is the creator, director and
hoard of trustees of the Geological and
Industrial Survey of California. He says
to Bowers. "Come!" and he comoth. and
to Watts. "Do this." and he doeth It. So
Gage has the outside and Cooper the in
side. Bo the situation would be funny If
It were not so sad.
But people interested. Including Â»â¢â¢*]
authorities, after examining the situation
rarefully. declare without hesitation that
the portion of the appropriation bill sot
ting aside this gubernatorial perquisite 1?
unconstitutional and void, and that It
would be -â¢'o declared by any court before
whom a suitor asked that the State Board
of Examiners be restrained from passing
the bills of the Governor"? mining bureau
The provision is called another piece of
legislative blacksmithlng.
It is pointed out that the State Mining
Bureau exists and is regulated by the act
of March 23. 1893. by which it was reor
ganized. This organic act. which was
drawn by Charles O. Yale. H. .as E.
Browne and John Hays Hammond, pro
vides for a board of five trustees, which
"shall have control of all properties and
fund." of paid bureau." Again It says that
the trustees "shall manage ami control all
the finances of said mining bureau." and
that tho fuml "out of which all the ex
penses of said bureau shall he paid shall
consist of â¢ â¢ â¢ such moneys a."
fr<>m time to time be appropriated by the
Legislature for the use of said bureau."
The State Mineralogist "shall perform
the duties of his office under the control,
direction and supervision of the Board â¢â¢(
Trustees." "The said State Mineralogist
shall have the right to appoint competent
assistants and qualified specialists when
necessary in the execution of his plans
nml to fix their compensation." but sub
ject to the approval of the Board of Trus
tees, and such appointments "shall not
become effective unless bo confirmed and
approved."
This statute thus clearly defines the
manner of control of all funds appropri
ated for the support of the bureau nnd
the manner In which assistants shall be
appointed. The appropriation bill was a
simple appropriation bill, entitled "An act
making an appropriation for the support
of the State government of the State of
California for the fifty-first and fifty
second fiscal years." The Mining Bireau
act wan not repealed or amended and
still provided the government of the bu
reau for which money was approj â¢
The appropriation bill gave "for the eup^
port of the State Mining Bureau for the
fifty-first and fifty-second fiscal years
$60,000." But this was followed by a "pro
vided" clause, which In effect amended
the act of March 23. 1593, by providing a
different way of appointing assistants and
fixing their salaries, and so far nullifying
that act.
The constitution regulates the manner
of amending laws, requiring that "every
ait shall embrace but one subject which
.shall be embraced In Its title"; providing
that If this law be infracted only so much
of an act not embraced In its title shall
h* void, and requiring a revised or amend
ed act to be "re-enacted and published
at length as revised or amended "
It 1b argued that the Mining Bureau
act was not so amended, and that It could
not be amended by an appropriation bill
Hence the Governor has no right to ap
point Mining Bureau experts and fix their
compensation. Perhaps an appropriation
bill could legally reorganlxe the National
Guard and provide that every private
â hould be appointed by the Governor at
a salary named by him. or provide a
dollar for each Insane asylum and a few
hundred thousand for the Governor to
use In boarding out crazy folks and pay
ing his doctors, and then perhaps it could
not. State Mineralogist Coopt-r disclaims
any Intention of flgl. 1 rnor on
these grounds and thy Trustees are keep-
Ing mum, but the interesting tangle will
likely become entertaining soon In va
rious ways. It is held that with the "nr >-
vi<i<-d" knocked out of the law, the whole
appropriation would go to the regular
bureau. This Is the Interesting an 1 doubt
ful tangle that "politics" bad got the
Mining Bureau Into.
As things stand the State Mineralo
gist and trustees have control of but $15,
000 a year. This Is asserted to be only
enough to keep the doors open and main
tain the present Inside force. When Mr.
Cooper took the office he made no re
movals, and that makes his present tlx
more Irritating. The bureau by another
act was allowed $7500 worth of State
printing besides the $50,000. The Governor
will not get a whack at that for print-
Ing reports of his experts without a light.
Mr. Cooper proposes to use It In publish
ing bulletins, maps, county mining regis
ters, etc.. whenever he can get the State
Printer started.
Many people are grinning at the spec
tacle of Governor Gage, M. E.. Ph.B. and
Doctor of Political Pap, as State Geolo
gist, and are wondering what sort of a fist
he will make of It and how he likes It
an far as he has got. But. perhaps, they
are only Jealous, and perhaps he â¢ will
make a record in the scientific world.
Others can't help thinking that If needed
scientific work In this Held Is to be done
It should be directed by the men and the
institution set to do this work for the
State.
Friends of the bureau regret to see It
so completely made a political Junkshop
and are afraid that it will Injure It in
public opinion and make It suffer in the
future.
It Is important that able men be sent
Into the California mining field at the
time of so great an awakening In the min
ing Industry, and when so much helpful
scientific and practical work needs to be
done, but yet the personality of the field
men appointed seems of less Importance
than the principle and method which hare
brought the Mining Bureau to Its present
low estate.
There Is already a howl going up
through the Suite, and It will soon be
louder. A sample one la wafted down
from San Andreas. The Calaveras Citi
zen makes this roar:
"Governor Gage has apolnted one
Stephen Bowers, editor of the Voice, a
Prohibition party organ of Los Angelas,
as Kxamlner of Mines, an office created
by the last Legislature. â¢ â¢ â¢ No min
ing legislation then accomplished created
more comment, and prominent miners
have been pulling wires and exerting In
fluences toward navlng the biggest men
among them selected by the execu
tive to do the work. â¢ â¢ â¢ There
were competent mining men galore
in both the northern and southern
mines who were recommended and who
w<mld have been satisfactory to a ma
jority of those Interested. The position
is an important one and should have been
Klven to a man arknowlÂ«Hlgedly at the
head cf mining affairsâ one whose merits
would have been Instantly recognized all
01 er the State.
"When Bowers' appointment was an
nounced the mining men of Central and
Northern California were dazed, and on
I \Â«-ry irrew indignant. Not only was
titness Ignored, but sectional or geograph
ical courtesies were utterly violated. The
pontaneous question among mining men
w i-<, "Who In Hades is Bowers? And
echo answereth not. Little Is now ex
pected from a measure authorizing the
expenditure of CViOO. and from whlf-h
mining men generally had great expecta
tions."
A Needles dispatch to the Los Angeles
Times says: "A rainfall of nearly .75 of
an Inch at Needles last week and a much
heavier fall in the adjacent mountains
and on the desert has added Impetus to
prospecting. Many old-time prospectors
have been waiting for rains In the moun
tains, so that they could venture Into
therwlse waterless regions In search of
mineral. More interest is being shown In
mining and prospecting than for some
it la estimated that a much larger
number of prospectors will be in the
mountains this fall than ever known be
fore. Capital is also being attracted this
way and information is
from many and distant points regarding
the mining and mineral outlook In the
Colorado River Vallejr."

The French torpedo gunboat La Helre.
recently built at Cherbourg dockyard, has
passed through a twenty-four hours' cor
tinuous trial, during which he avcrag.-i
twenty knots, the engines developing WO
horsepower. The four hours' forced
draught trial had to be abandoned owing
to hot bearings. The vessel Is calculatM
to make twenty-three knots with TOW
horsepower.
Hallebarde. French torpedo gunboat of
300 tons, built by Normand. Havre, real
ized a mean speed of 22 knots during fly*
hours under natural draught, ami 27.2
knots under forced draught during one
hours run. As the boat Is thirty fÂ«*et
shorter and thirty-five tons greater dis
placement than boats of similar type In
England, the performance appears highly
satisfactory.
The British third-class cruiser Barham
of 1830 tons, built In I*B9. has had her old
boilers replaced with Thorny croft water
tube boilers. At th â¢ three hours'
trial she developed 12S0 horsepower
and a speed of 13.21 knots. This
vessel when first built was a
source of great disappointment tn
the Admiralty. She was calculated to
steam 19' 3 knots under forced draught:
after four trials and considerable altera
tions she passed through the <'!ght hours'
trial February 17. !â  'i. with a mean speed
of 17.348 knots on MM horsepower. Bras
sy's Annual credits the ship with 470Q
horsepower and 18. C knots speed.
The Turkish Navy Department has re
covered a considerable amount of th*Â»
treasure sunk off Smyrna In thÂ« battle of
1770. The Russian admiral's ship Tshesm*
and other ships were sunk in waters 00
to 120 fathoms In depth, and the Greek
divers hired to recover moneys and otbtr
valuables lost have had a hard ia k. (or
which, howtver, they have received tho
handsome nun of 5J4.000 thus far. Tho
divers located the Russian ship and took,
out 12.000 golden ducats. 20.000 golden
double ducats and a vast quantity of
other gold and silver coins, besides Jew
elry, Future operations will bo carried
out on the sunken Turkish ships.
Holland is preparing to build a coast de
fense vessel of 4960 tons at Rotterdam.
Its dimensions are: Length. 222 feet;
breadth. 64 feet; draught, 17 feet 8 inch* 1.
The engines of 5300 horsepower are to give
a speed of 16 knots, and with C-0 tons of
coal a radius of action of COOO knots at
ten-knot speed Is calculated. The ship
will have a six-Inch all-around armor
belt, two turrets of ten Inches and a pro
tective deck of two and a half inches. Tha
battery is composed of two 9.4-inch, car
ried singly In turrets; four 5.D Inch quick
firers; four 12 pounders and eight 1.4
pounders. The torpedo arrangement In
cludes two submerged broadside and or.*

The system in sheathing ships DJ
Russian navy Is t
Grantham and differs greatly from |]
White, which Is used in the British ax.d
American navies. Grantham's is fa:
expensive and complicated tn that it em
braces two thicknesses of wood laid on
vertically for the inner layer and c
horizontally by the outer layer, and it
also provides for longitudinal steel string
ers The White system Is that of one
thickness of planking with a heavy coat-
Ing of paint or marine glue on the metal
skin, the planking being securely fasten
ed and tightly calked. The advantage
with this latter system is Its elm;
and Insignificant cost, besides thÂ« â 
to effect local repairs w
off large surfaces of she..'
Russian Admiralty sticks to Ol
system, giving as reasons: First. .
nniteslmal cost; necond, that the In
creased weight of Z per cent dim.:
the speed only 1 per cent: r> ;r\J, that if
properly done it entirely secures tl

fourth, that the il stringers add
to the general solidity of the hull.

who have seen It in the years long pone
I by many changes have taken place there,
but, thank God, they are for the better.
"I saw my native land after being
away from her shores for fourteen years.
The changes were wonderful. It has In

a land where great deeds have been per

Father Yorke told of his voyage across

APOSTOLIC DELEGATE
ON HIS WAY TO MANILA
Archbishop Chapelle.
\ 4 ONSIGNOR CHAPELI,E. Archbishop of New Orleans and apostolic
A/\ delegate to the Philippines, arrive*! in the city yÂ»-stÂ» r<l.iy morning and
IT 1 is now at the Palace, where he will r< main until Tuesday next, when
he leaves on the Sherman for Manila-
Accompanying the Archbishop is Rev. Father T. Stenmans of Holland,
', who goes to Luzon In the capacity of secretary to the distinguished prelate.
Father McKinnon will bo the third member of the party, hut will not have
any official connection with the Archbishop, as has been commonly supposed.
He will go merely as an army chaplain, but his knowledge of the Philippines
and of the conditions obtaining there will be of Infinite value to the Arch
bishop, who will avail himself In a large measure of the counsels of the cx
, chaplain tf the First California Regiment.
The mission of Monslgnor Chapelle is similar to that which carried him
to Cuba and Porto Rico at the conclusion of the 4kir with Spain. Previous to
that difficulty there existed a union of church and state in all the Spanish
colonies, which has been dissolved In such as have come under the sway of
the United States. This change has been productive of all sorts of entangle
ments, which the Archbishop will endeavor to straighten out as far as lies
in his power.
Though a Frenchman by birth. Archbishop Chapella Is in every other
sense a thoroughgoing American. His work In Cuba and Porto Rico speaks
for Itself, and has resulted In his carryinÃ with him on his present mission
the confidence of every well-informed American, irrespective of creed. He
will use his influence to promote the general welfare of all classes In the
islands, and his constant aim will be to do his best to forward the policy
of both church and country.
Upon arriving here yesterday morning Archbishop Chapelle was met by
Father McKinnon and Vicar General Prendergast and taken to the Cathe
dral, where he celebrated mass. At the conclusion of his religious duties he
waÂ« entertained at luncheon at the residence of the Virar General and then
driven to the Palace Hotel, where rooms had been reserved for him.
Though it was not the wish of the distinguished visitor to be Interviewed.
he. consented to receive a representative of The Call. He is a man of great
personal magnetism and with a fund of ready humor that sparkles through
all his conversation and causes one to leave his presence envious of those
who will have the pleasure of becoming his traveling companions on the long
voyage across the Pacific.
the sea like a sentinel wall around the
country.
"But best of all Is that hospitality, that
blg-heartedness that clasp of the hand to
the friend that has come back. No hearts
are so open, no hospitality so generous as
that of the Irish people. The first thing
that struck me when I began to look
about were that the people were so much
more comfortable and so much better
clothed. Everywhere there was evidence
of prosperity. The economic condition of
the Irish people to-day Is equal to that of
any other nationality similarly situated.
â¢It is purely an agricultural country,
the manufacturing being confined to n
small corner. The trouble with agricul
ture there has been that it was twice
stolen from the people within a century.
Twice in that time the land was taken
from those who tilled it. It was such in
tolerance of the British that created the
landlord class that bad no sympathy for
the tenants. Early in the century they
be^an to demand their pound of flesh. I
remember the time when the people car
ried In baskets on their backs sand and
seaweed from the shores to build on the
bare rock the soil in which to raise their I
potatoes, and on this they were charged
rent, and the soldiers and the police stood
back of the landlords to enforce their de
mands. Think of those conditions when
all of the improvements were made by the
people.
"Parnell came then as the savior of the
country- The people rebelled against the
oppression: they stood shoulder to shoul
der and gave their ultimatum to England.
Then the laud became owned by the land
lords and the tenants with equal Inter
ests, but this dual proprietorship Is
gradually disappearing and the people
are buying their own farms with money
advanced by the Government. The inter
est Is less than the rent and the farmers
have the satisfaction of proprietorship."
Father Yorke said that this was one of
the most hopeful signs that he noted, and
be asserted that It was due in a largo
measure to the work of the Catholic
clergy among the people. He denied that
there was any truth in the famine stories
that occasionally reach this country from
Ireland. He .-aid they were founded on
conditions that exist in what Is known as
the congested districts of the island,
which conditions could easily be remedied
if England would show the proper spirit.
England, be said, has always been able
to scatter money like water in foreign
wars, but she is very stingy In caring
for her own subjects. He continued:
"One Of the bad things that I saw In
the country was that the people are not
eating their own potatoes and not drink-
Ing their own milk. Tea and bread seem
to be the chief articles of food.
"The Catholic priests are back of much
of the advancement of the people; they
have not only been looking after their
souls but after their bodies as well. â¢ The
Irish people are not backward, not dead,
not sleeping. If they i id any kind of
government they would be In far more
prosperous condition than they are. They
are still Striving in and out of season to
better their temporal and religious condi
tion, and If the Irish priests can only keep
the train ngolng at its present rate the
future will bring us all what we wish
for."
Father Yorkc said that one of the ffreat
esi dangers is that they have lost their
Gaelic language; that It has been crushed
out of them through the national school
system, find if they do not see the danger
In time they will become little more than
pock*>t editions of Britons.
"One hundred years ago brightness
dawned on Ireland, when the English
were bottled up at Yorktown." he con
cluded. "They went hack across the ocean
again and were Â»rlad to treat the Irish
with kindness. The Fame thing Is now
occurring on another continent. Eng
land's difficulty In South Africa Is Ire
land's opportunity, and I hope that her
people will take advantage of It and then
will come that Independence that we all
pray for. and Ireland will take her place
among the nations of the world."

VI. Tx^F TAMING OF THE SHREW
(Concluded.)
The Play as an Acting Drama.
The dramatic honors of "The Taming if
the Shrew" as an acting play belong to
America. The play Is scarcely known to
the English stage at all. What Is known.
Instead, is a farcical version of it. in
three acts, compiled by Garrlck in the
middle of the last century (17M?). known
as "Katharine and Petruchio." GarrlcK.
though he loved Shakespeare well, and
won many of his greatest honors in re
suscitating Shakespearean plays and im
personating Shakespearean characters.
paw in "The Taming of the Shrew" .iot
the spirit of comedy which Shakespeare
intended, hut the spirit of farce. Aceori
ingly. he made a somewhat coarse and
broad farce out of it. And a coarse,
broad and unfortunately as a rule â  sonip-
ADA REHAN AS KAIHARINA.
what vulpar farce It has for the most
part subsequently remained.
Garrlck is not to be wholly blamed for
this. The play as a comedy U pernaps
the least Interesting that Sh.ik-
Wrote The character of Katharlna Is
not attractive either to players or to spec
tators, at rteast to the players an<l the
spectators of to-day; and the ctaractOT
of Petruchio is less so. Nor are tho mirmr
characters, though for the most part th"y
are well delineated, sufficiently Important
in tho dramatic action of the play to he
Interesting either.
It was the late Mr. Augu~tin Daly who
stated ShakeÂ«ji<>are's play of 'The
Taming of the Shrew" and gave It a
distinction and honor It never knew he
foreâln fact the only rral distinction nnd
honor It ever knew. This he did In l fi Â«7.
Hfl presented "The Taming of the Shrew"
almost as Shakespeare wrote It. Includ
ing even the "Induction," only that he
shortened the play somewhat and amal
gamated some of the scenes In whl^h P-t
ruchlo and Katharlna appeared togstbef
In order to make them more effective.
In addition, he magnificently staged the
play: for example, making the banqu-t
scene at the end an affair of almost rt*^ il
splendor. Kuthermore, ho gave to H a
capital cast. Ada Rehan was the Katha
rlna. John Drew the Petrix hlo and Wil
liam Gilbert the Christopher Sly. An a
result the glamour of a great name, of a
Shakespearean revival In short, together
with Intrinsic merit In every department
of the production Itself, won for his effort
the brilliant honor of both an esthetic
ami a pecuniary success.
Of Ada Rehan's Kaili irina In this re
vival there Ib but one opinion. It was in
every way a complete realization of
Shakespeare's conception. It at
took Its place in the glorious company Of
the world's ldeaJ Shakespearean heroines,
along with Adelaide Nellsnn'* Juliet. i:i
len Terry's Ophelia and Helen Kaucll's
Rosalind.
It Is doubtful, however, if ever there
will be another manager to try throws
with fortune In "The Taml'i* of the
Shrew" as Mr. Daly did. and iher- f re
still more doubtful If ever th< re w'll lÂ»e
another Katharlna equal to Miss Baton's
Katharina.
In England there have been two at
tempts to reproduce Shakespeare's "Tam
ing of the Shrew." One of UMM w i- :v.
ls4Â»>-47. when under the dlifclKm of the
dramatic critic and author, J EL I'l.tn
che. the play was brought out as nearly
as possible like what it would have t â 
In Shakespeare's time. There was no
stage scenery and the changes of seenÂ©
in the play were indicated by the baas>
Ing up ->l placards, the placards nav'ng
the names of the scenes written upon
them. In this reproduction Mm Nlsbeti
(then T^ady Booth) was the Katharlna. and
with her beauty, her vivacity anil h-r
exhilarating humor a very effective X >tn
arlna she was. It is said that her eyes
were as bewitching and her laugh aa
mirth-provoking at Mrs. Jordan's.
The other English production of "The
Taming of the Bhrew" was that marir by
that conscientious laborer In the Bh.-ik- v
perean vineyard. Samuel Phelps of Ba<l
ler'n Wells. In 1856 Mr. Phelps prr - -
the play In Its original form as one of
his series <the tm*enty-nlnth In the series,
we believe* of great Shakespearean re
vivals. But. unlike Plane-he. Mr. I'h-Ips
produced the play as Mr. Daly afterward
did In New York, with a liberal -qu.p
ment of scenery and appropriate .oi
tumes. The remarkable feature In this re
production was the part taken In It by
the great Shakespearian nctor ami
scholar himself. Instead of taking the
part of Petruchlo. which would natural
ly have been his, for he had frequently
played it in Oarrlck'B "Katharine ard
Petruchio." he took th* much humr.l, r
part of Christopher Sly, and this simply
for the purpose of presenting to h:
rons what he conceived to be the true
Shakespearean conception of this very
amusing but minor part. The admirers
of Shakespeare owe a great debt of grat
itude to Samuel Phelps. Without 4mM
he did more toward extending a true
knowledge cf Shakespeare throughout the
play-going world than any other human
being.
Adaptations of "The Shrew" have been
very popular in Germany from the seven
teenth century} In 1&4, out of 70S per
form.Â»rre<Â« of twenty-five Shakespearean
plays in Germany. "The 8hrÂ»"w" was giv
en eighty-three tlmÂ«Â«* by flfty-onc compa
riles, exclusive, of some twenty-five times
In the earlier version of ivj_.
Questions for Research and Review.
1. What dramatic purpose is subserved
by the Induction? Why do we hear no
more of Sly after act I of the play proper?
2. By what means is the drunken Sly
flattered into a "lord"?
3. Can you separate th* three little plays
that make up this comedy? How are they
entangled Into one unity?
4. Does your enjoyment of the play arise
mainly from the quecrness of the charac
ters or from the |INfBW of the situa
tions?
5. Which affords the more extravagant
fun. "The Comedy of Errors" or "The
Taming of the Shrew"? In which one of
these plays are the characters and situa
tions the more nearly normal?
8 What are the aucceaslva stages In tha
taming of R
7. What two characters are most highly
Individualized? What scenes do ftm
â *i'IÂ«T â¢ Is there a relationship . f
cause and eff.ct between the two parti â  f
this question?
I Do I'-truchlo and Katharlna offer
points of contrast? Is Petruchlo assum
ing his character merely until Kathaiin*
Â»*hall be tamed?
9. Do you Imagine Katharlna to be with
out physical beauty? Has she. any excuse
for her actions In the early part of the
play?
10. What role has Rlanca to perform In
the part of the plot that precedes her
marriage?
11. Contrast the Widow. Btanca and
Katharlna as wives. Which character Is
least Individualized?
12. Contrast Hortenslo, Lucentlo and Pe
truchlo as husbands. What traits of char
acter are different In the first two?
13. Compare the repartee and word-play
In this comedy with that In "Love's I.a
bor's Lost" and "The Comedy of Errors"
âboth M to amount and as to keenness.
Is there, In any of these plays, evidence
that the poet restrained his power In re
spect to these things?
14. How do the fathers of the play com
pare?
15. Are you satisfied with the way In
which Oremlo Is disposed of? What In his
character and circumstances tends to rec
oncile you?
16. What are Orumio's strong points?
Tranlo's? Which Is the better schemer?
17. Consider the clowns and servants of
the plays thus far studied. What seem to
be common characteristic* of these
clowns? In what do they differ? Which
is the most capable of them all? And
which Is the most cloddish?

BEST GAME
OF BASEBALL
THIS YEAR
All-Californias Find Eleven
Innings Necessary to Beat
the Champions.
All California 4. Sacramento 3.
With Hughes, the foremost pitcher in
America, in the box, the All-California
team had to play two extra Innings tc de
feat tho champion Sacramento nine. Xot
for many a day has such baseball been
j played in this city. Over 6500 enthusiastic
j Fpectators packed the stands and bleach-,
ers of the Recreation grounds, expecting
to see an exhibition of high class base
ball, and in this they were not disappoint
ed. Tho game was of that Interesting or
der that holds the attention from start to
finish. At no time during the game did
one team have more advantage over the
other than a single run, and during live,
innings the non was tied. The crowd en-
Joyed the sport and excitedly applauded
all of the many sensational featured of
the two hours' contest.
Both Hughes and Harvey pitched great
ball, and the teams back of them gave
their most earnest support. It was a test
as to the relative merits of a team made
up of cracks of the big leagues and the
local champions. Sacramento does not
lose much by the comparison, if their
game yesterday was a criterion.
The California League champions came
first to bat and Harvey â¢cored the lirs.
run of the day. When he walked to the
bat he was received with shouts and ap
plause. A two-bagger evoked greater
noise from the bk-achcrs. On Sullivan's
out Harvey went to third, scoring on
Chance's throw to second to forestall Ea
gan, who had been given his base on
balls. Two nil were made by All-Call
fornla In the nrst. Van Haltren and
Chance coursing the bags.
In the next inning Sacramento sent
Doyle over the plate. Finding Hughes for
a two-bagger, lie went to the third sta
tion on Shanahan's sacritice. scoring on
an error of Johnson. Two all the score
read, and was not changed until the tilth
inning, when the "home returners" took
the It-ad. After two men had been en
tombed. Merles was made a present of
Jlrst base, stole second and on a bad
throw of Stanley to Sheehan crossed the
rubber. In the eighth the score was Mod
by Sacramento. Sullivan earned his first
base on a hit anJ coursed the bags when
Stanley hit to right Held. Johnson allow
ing the, ball to Blip through his lists. Score
three all.
After this ram.- nn < setting two In

DOROTHY DRESSER WAITS
FOR HER TRUANT TOMCAT
T? ITTLE DOROTHY DRESSER,
LITTLE DOROTHY DRESSER,
niece of Captain Marden of the
Jl â 3 wrecked barkentine Jane A.
Falkenburg. If overjoyed at the
news that her big black cat "Budge,"
who was thought to have been
drowned when the vessel met disas
ter, has been saved. "Budge" was
Dorothy's pet- She had befriended
the feline when he was an outcast and
h'iÂ»t him to sea with her uncle on his
last voyage in order to save his life.
The black cat's nocturnal concerts
nad not been appreciated in the neigh
borhood where his youthful mistress
dwells and It was brougfit to her at
tention that there was a frightful plot
on foot to end his promising career
with cold poison.
When the crew of the Falkcnburg
was rescued they took off "Budge" In
the lifeboat, but he escaped from his
Keeper and swam back to the sinking
ship. Dorothy learned of the wreck,
expressed much happiness that her
undo and his crew had been saved.
but her heart was broken when she
heard of the fate of "Budge."
Some days later when the news
reached here that the derelict had
been towed into Esquimau by the tug
Lome Dorothy scanned the papers for
a word about her cat and went Into
ecstasies of childish glee when Mm
read that "Budge" was safe and
sound on board the Lome, only a lit
tle the worse for a lone fast and the
buffeting of an angry sea. She at once
set about devising ways and means
for the. return of tabby to his na
tive land. Miss Dorothy, after much
deliberation, drafted on her slate the
outline of a letter appealing to Cap
tain Locke of the Lorna to take pood
care of "Budge" and send him back
to her. Her letter tells the story:

FALL OF MAN IS ONLY
A BIBLICAL ALLEGORY
Moses Did Not Write All if Any
of the Pentateuch.
Two Startling Statements Made by Rev.
C. R. Brown of the Oakland Con
gregational Church,
The story of the fall of man in the Bible is only an allegory.
We hare no reason to believe that Moses wrote any or all of the
Pentateuch.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
â¢08 Broadway. Deft S.
These two remarkable propositions are
the essence of a talk delivered by Rev.
O.arles R. Brown, pastor of the First
Congregational Church. Tho talk was de
livered after the morning service nt the
formation of an adult Bible class, to
which Mr. Brown had invited his church.
Bible study for adults Is one of the be
liefs of the pastor, and he began a very
Â« xtenslve move In this direction to-day.
The great bulk of his congregation ac
cepted his Invitation to attend the class,
and In opening he made an introductory
address. In which these startling.declara
tions were made.
That the statements were received with
astonishment by some members Is certain.
but the majority of those present had
been. In a measure, brought up to this.
For r. early a year an adult Blb'.e class has
beon studying Washington Gladden'is
"Who Wrote the Bible?" which takos
much the same ground as that taken by
Mr. Brown, and so this was not -luite
njch a t-hock as It might otherwise have
been to tin extremely orthodox church.
BtXt these t-tatements were so unusual and
almost entirely unexpected that socss of
the raore orthodox members received
them In silence.
Mr. Brown has made a profound Im
pression In Oakland rtnee his arrival here.
The raster of an orthodox church from
the Puritan section of Massachusetts, he
haÂ» several timea startled his congrega
tion with the liberality of his views. But.
while he hag made statements about the
lUble and theology which would have
Men extremely sensational coming from
an orthodox pulpit, he has always made
Them without the least desire for pub
licity. He has given his messages to his
congregation and has not courted the pub
lic print*. The study of "Who Wrote the
WMe?" created a mild breere. and when
Mr. Brown declared that some sections of
the Gohpel according to St. John were not
the work of that apostle there r.as au
< ther flutter.
There was a distinct sensation, how
ever, to-day whon he launched Into Old
To^tnmer.t history. HU statements, in
suhstance nnd In part, wore an follow*:
"There Â»re two different accounts of the
creation In tho r'.rst two chanters of Gene
*lsâevidently written by different men
and probably at widely different periods.
Wa have no reason to suppose that Moses
wrote all or. Indeed, any of the Penta

EARNESTLY APPEALS TO MEN
TO ATTEND DIVINE WORSHIP
Rev. D. C. Garrott, rector of St. Luke'n.
delivered a pointed talk to his congrega
tion last night, on the importance of In
ducing men to attend divine worship. His
re-ms were- directed especially to the
Brotherhood of fit. Andrew, under whose
â¢ utrJces the wrvices wre held. He said
St. Luke's chapter of the society was or
panlzed In response to a need; to awaken
to life the laity of the church; to have
the people who belong feel that the
rhur*b did not exist for the educated, the
cultured and for the pew rents, but for
tradltl. r.Â«. taking what seemed to him
th.
'"In r.ne. trees were create.l before the
eun. Now. undoubtedly God could create
trttÂ»s and make them bring forth fruit
without BUD, or perform any other thing
th;it was not wicked, but hÂ«> does not
work In this Jerky method. In one man
whs created Crst. in the other last, bo th.it
there can be no question of reading
t-clence Into these accounts. They repre
sent tho knowledge of the time.
"As fowls were created before fishes In
one account, the question was asked If
flying fishes could not have been meant,
and also If the days referred to could not
have been periods. Mr. Brown said in re
gard to the first of these questions that,
while sometimes one could fudge and jug
gle with wordj and make a point, he did
not think it well to do so with the words
of the Bible. As far as science has demon
strated, reptiles and fishes were created
before birds. The periods referred to
were of twenty-four hours, because It
was fo clearly expressed, and the even-
Ing and the morning were the first second
and third day.
"Man, as far as we know In the pres
ent development of science, was formed
from a long line of ancestors of the lower
orders. When he reached a stage fitted
to receive It. God breathed Into him his
spiritâ a moral nature â and he became
free to choose good and evil. Man was
not created, according to most mytholo
gies and traditions, a perfect moral be
ing. His moral nature has grown, Is grow
ing as his physical nature did. Whether
you believe with the evolutionists or with
the first two chapters of Genesis, the ba
sic truth Is the same. God made man out
of the material at hand. How he gath
ered this together, whether by evolution
or in six days, does not affect the great
central truth that he made man.
"The story of the fall of Adam, as con
tained In the third chapter of Genesis. Is
an nllegory. The serpent, although pic
tured standing upright on tho. tip of hi-:
tall r.n certain Assyrian tablets, has al
ways crawled on his belly; therefore, the
curse pronounced upon him in that chap
ter Is not true. He II represented as talk
ingâwhich Is the usual allegorical form.
The curse of toll pronounced upon Adam
and his descendants here, it lias been
proved. Is not a curse, for toll Is the
greatest blessing given to man.
"The fall of Adam has been read Into
the Bible by that very beautiful poem
Milton's 'Paradise Ix>st.' which, however
beautiful a* poetry. Is very bad theology
I ntil the time of the Puritans it had no
place in the doctrines of the church.
"The fall of Adam Is never mentioned
from the third chapter of Genesis to the
last verso of Malachlâ prophets, priests
kin*- none of them alluded to It Christ
Peter. James. John, newr spoke of it Only
four times Is it mentioned In the New
Testament, and then by Paul as a side
Illustration."
! reaching out to get hold of men who
don tgo to church. He regretted that so
rew men went to church, and he discussed
some of the reasons that kept them away.
He said they should bo Induced to come
by concerts, pood sermons and shorter
services. He also thought It was the place
of the brotherhood to extend Invitations
to the men; to stand by the door and ask
them to come in and attend the services;
I in other words, to show that they wero

that he was in favor of the members of

the purpose of inquiring it. > the action of

Ing Dr. Mayer from his position of visit

marked the proceedings. About â¦"Â»' mem

consider the matter calmly.
On the stage with President pallet
were seated vice President liaoul Char

Kabregue. John Herpes and the others
of the administration committee. Dr.
Mayer was an Interested spectator and
sat in the first row with his counselor
and Interpreter. F. Cadley.
ThÂ» trouble was precipitated after thÂ«
reading of the report or the. administra

dismissed. At this point Aiphonse Bous
quet presented his resolutions providing;
for a vote of contldence In the committee,
sustaining It in Its action against Dr.
Mayer and declaring an Indefinite post

opposed by O. Bozle and P. t.'adley, who
asked that the question be discussed bv

In the discussion and that the doctor bo

stated that Dr. Mayer was not on trial,
and expressed his Intention to put thÂ«

It all could be heard Dr. Mayer's voice
saying:
"I desire to -fend myself."
After wrangling for more than an hour.
Vice President Chartres arose, and as
silence fell over the assemblage he re
quested In the Interest of harmony that
Dr. Mayer bo allowed to speak. Chair

toward the stage and addressed himself
to Mr. Chartres. saying:
"Why do yÂ«>u come nt this late day and

Mrs. Charlton Edholm, well known In

lectures In this city last night, Howard
M. E. Church was the scene of her first
Introduction to people of San FrancUco
who are philanthropic-ally Inclined, and
'"The Traffic In Girls" her subject.
A few well chosen words of Introduction
from the Rev. John A. M. Wilson served
to Introduce the lady to her audience uml
she proceeded to reveal a few home truth â <
without mincing of words.
The lecture evidently produced a pro
found impression and when the speaker
c-allrd on thoso present, who had the
cause at heart and would do all they
could to further It. to hold up their
hand*, there was not a man or woman
that did not comply.
Th*Â» speaker told of her experiences In
Chicago and the large cities of the East,
and of the lives led by those she and her
comrades were trying to save. She laid
the cause of the girls' fall chiefly at the
door of liquor. "Show me a place where
liquor is sold and I'll show you within
two blocks a house of shame. she n.Vd.
Then calling on the men to vote for nÂ«vn
local government she stated that the po
lice of all largo cities arc in direct â¢â¢>n
nlvance with the trarflc. from which thÂ«-y
receive a large revenue In bribes. "An'J. '
the speaker continued, "the police, under
present conditions, even If they wou'd
stop this hideous traffic, could not; for
what can be done to save girls from the
snares of the procurers for men willing
to pay $1000, $2000. $3000 for the possession
of a face or form that has attracted their

"We must organize homes, where *lrl*
who are trying to live honestly on $2 or 13
a week, may be able to make their funÂ«?s
suffice. Hut there must be no appearancA
of charity about It. That word has driven
almost as many women to a life of
shamo as have been dragged down from
any other cause." In conclusion Mrs.
Edholm called on all to contribute their

to mothers, the spirit of revenge It plants

A larv- and important meeting of the

Additional rumors as to the cause of

per head required for each Chinaman tak

a number of years they have failed to
turn any of this money into the treasury
of the societies. It is also said that Satn
Tupa as well as See Yups are against
the merchants, and that they have good
reason to fear for their lives.

INSTANT DEATH
CAME CLOSE TO
ONE QUARRYMAN
Falling Bowlder Just
Missed Him.
â¦ â
OVERDUE SHIPS HEARD FROM
Lee Cook had a narrow escape yester
day from instant death at Gray Brothers'
qunrry on Telegraph Hill. He was at
work on the face of the cliff making a
pa.Â«safje for the men to reach their work,
when a lot of loose stones began to tum
ble about him. Looking upward, he khw
& huge bowlder tottering, ready to fall.
From a cottage on the top of, Telegrapn
Hill a rope drops to the ground below.
This rope Is used by the quarrymen In
going up and flown the hill. Cook sprang
for the rope and v missed It. Losing his
footing he fell twenty feet to the street
below, the bowlder coming tumbling after,
him. Cook struck on hlB head, but had
enough sense left In him to scramble away
on his hands and knees. He had not
moved five feet when the rock fell right
at his side. The injured man was taken
to the Harbor Hospital, where Dr. Mot
rlÃon found that a piece was chipped out
of bis skull and that he was badly bruis
ed about the body. The doctor considers
that Cook had a marvelous escape, lie
was removed during the afternoon to his
home at 1*22 Battery street.
The overdue ship Glory of the Seas ar
rived last night from Comox, B. C. She
was thirty-two days making tho run from
the Sound and experienced some very
heavy weather. A heavy southeaster
blew nearly all the time the ship was out
and Captain Freeman found it impossible
to make any headway. The provisions
gave out and for a time it looked as
though the men would have to resort to
seagulls for diet. Luckily, on November
30. the United States training ship Adams
hove in sight and from her the starving
men got enough stores to last them lor
ten days. Soon after that there was a
slight change of wind and Captain Free
man was able to work his way to port.
The collier Bristol, which arrived yes
terday. spoke the Czarina in tow of the
Holyoke. 100 miles south of Flattery last
"Wednesday. The Czarina broke her shaft
a month ago and is being towed here for
repairs.
There Is no word from the overdue
schooner! Amethyst and S. Danielson.
Both are out over a month and must be
short of provisions. The Amethyst was
supplied by the transport Columbia more
than three weeks ago, but those stores
must have given out several days a^o
unless the men have been on short allow
ance right along. The revenue cutter Mc-
Culloch is now out searching for the
overdue! and may pick up both vessels.
The scow schooner Excedra anchored
over the Postal Telegraph cable Saturday
night. Word was sent to the captain
not to move and a tug would be sent to
his assistance. Instead of waiting the
captain of the scow set his Jib and
tried to raise his anchor with the
result that the cable was broken. This
Is the fourth time this cable has been
broken within a month.
The battleship lowa will go outside to
day for a three or four hours' cruise to
try her engines.
H. D. Bendixsen of Eureka came down
In the steamer Brunswick last Saturday.
The Brunswick towed the Santa Paula
down. The latter is built to carry 7500
barrels of oil and will be towed up and
down the coast by the oil steamer George
Loomis. In case of an emergency (fie
Santa Paula is schooner rigged and can
shift for herself. The Santa Paula was
built by Bendixsen. There is now on
the stocks in Bendlxsen's yard a four
masted schooner for Captain Charles Nel
son. a three-masted schooner for the
McCollom Fishing and Trading Company,
ft barkentlne for Sudden & Christiansen,
â  steamer for the Humboldt Shingle As
sociation and a steamer for Gray &
Mitchell.
The steamer Robert Dollar, now nearlng
completion at Grays Harbor, will go into
the Nome trade In the spring. She has
been chartered by Captain Rathbone. late
with the Oregon Railway & Navigation
Company and v.-ill run between Seattle,
St. Michael, Cape Nome and Cape York.

RECOGNITION IS
ASKED FOR THE
YOUNG OFFICERS
Plan to Send Them to
West Point.
â â¦
A REWARD FOR VOLUNTEERS
A movement similar to one set on foot
just after the civil war is now being un
dertaken in behalf of the yoiing otHcerÂ»
who served in the war with Spain In Cuba
and the Philippines. It Is a plan to have
those officers who are under 21 appointed
to the Military Academy at West Point.
In reward for their appointed at
large, not as district appointments.
The idea, so far as the young officers of
the last war are concerned, originate.!
With Mrs. E. A. Belcher, wife of Judge E.
A. Belcher of this city. She wrote to the
Governors of the various States asking
that they send to her the names and ad
dresses of those officers who served in the
State volunteers and who are under "l. In
the letter the object of the request was
stated, and on early reply was aeked for.
The letter was as follows:
Governor : I desire to obtain thÂ« nimÂ«i,
aet-8 and places of residence of commissioned
officers from your State who Â«erred as volun
teers In the war of '98 and who were under the
age of 21. The object is to introduce a bill In
Congress whereby thete young men will be
given an opportunity to take the entrance ex
aminations at West Point preparatory to tak
ing cadetshlps there. I shall feel grateful If
this can receive you early attention.
The first letter was sent out about the
beginning- of November and within a
week answers began to come In. Now
there are not more than fifteen Governors
to be heard from, and the list of young
officers so far obtained by Mrs. Belcher
is large enough to promise at least thirty
or more when all the States have been
heard from.
When all the ellgibles have been com
municated with and asked to interest
their Congressmen, a bill will be Intro
duced In Congress allowing the appoint
ments by the President. It is not likely
that It will fall. Congressman F. C. Need
ham of Modesto, Cal7, will probably intro
duce the bill. He has taken an active in
terest in the movement from Its Inception
and he will be one of its warm supporters
when it comes before the next session.
Hull of Ohio has also been found favor
able, and there are a great many army
officers who will help In bringing It to a
successful Issue.
At the close of the civil war the same
kind of a plan was favorably considered
by Congress and the result was some
very worthy appointments to the Military
Academy. Several of these appointees
have won distinction In the army since
then, and the experiment Is considered by
army officers to be one that can safely be
repeated. There were not very many offi
cers under 21 In the last war, but there
was a number large enougn to warrant
the interest taken in their behalf. It la
argued that they have shown their will
ingness and their ability to serve the
country, and they are, therefore, worthy
of an opportunity to enter the Military
Academy and to adopt as a profession
the defense of the flag.
SANDBAGGED R. W. SWEET.
Bold Crime Committed on Clay Street
Saturday Night.
Richard W. Sweet, who resides at Z2\
Adeline street. Oakland, was sandbagged
at the corner of Clay and Drumm streets
about 11 o'clock lust night. He was
passing down Clay street in the direction
of the ferry, and had reached Battery
when ho discovered that he was being fol
lowed by two men. At first he dll no
pay any attention to them, and It w.t
riot until Battery street was reached that
he found they were close upon him. As
he turned one of the men struck hi:n on
the head with a focK filled with sand
ar.'l be fell to the pavement. His cries
attracted a citizen, and before the men
could commit rlbbery they were fright
ened away.
Sweet describes one of the men as being
large anÂ«l wearing dark whiskers. !
ported the matter immediately afterward
to the harbor police.

TRIED TO MURDER HIS
BRIDE OF THREE WEEKS
B. Greenhood Attempted to Carve
His Wife With a Razor,
Thinking She Was Untrue to Him He Re
solved to Kill Her and Then Commit
Suicide Saved by Policeman,
IN a moment of frer.zy. occasioned by .
jcaJousy. U. A. Grfriihood, who Is j
well connected In New York, early j
yesterday morning made a desperate j
attempt to murder hit wife, whom he j
married about tl,r"Â»- weeks ago.
The couple lived at &W Grant avenue. I
?uspectir.s that his wife w;us unfaithful to â 
her maniaKC vows Greeohodd procured a
razor from a friend, and going to their
apartments aocused her of paying atten
tion to other men. Mrs. Greenhood em- i
phatically dÂ«*nied the impeachment and
started to leave the room, after threaten- j
Ing to "return to her mamma." Angered j
at her threat Greenhood drew his razor, !
and flourishing it over her head an- I
r.ounred bis determination of -â¢ tiding her
to the Morgue.
Realizing that he meant what he said
the thoroughly frightened bride attempted j
to argue with him, when he tnade a j
flash ai her throat with the raror. For- j
turiately Greenhood's hand nw unsteady j
and the keen weapon passed harmlessly
over her head, lnt-tantly she darted from '
thf room and ran downstairs, lustily call- j
Ing for !â¢'.}). Her screams attracted the |
attention of* Police Ortloer Geiman, who.
was in the vicinity, and he rushed to her j
rescue, : After learning her story the po- i
llcoman went to the apartments of the j
i-ouple and placed Greenhood under ar- I
resU. He denied that be had attempted to j
kill his wife and I* gced not to be locked ;
up. Despite hi.* protestations he was j
promptly h:indcuffÂ«-<l and escorted to the
California-street Mation.
When searched an unsigned note ad- <
dr**ed to the OoronÂ«-r. in which the writer
declared hi.* intention of murdering his ,
wife and then cutting his own throat, was
found in his possession. At the request of '

his wife a charge of threats against life
was recorded against him.
Gre-enhood's rather Is connected with
the firm of Rafael. Tuck, Sons & Co. of
New York. Some time ago the young
man left the parental roof and came to
this city. He had considerable money
with him and spent It with a lavish
hand. A short time ago Greenhood found
himself penniless, and failing to induce
his father to send him more money, he
accepted a position as clerk on the trans
port Newport. About three weeks ago
ho met the woman whom he now calls
wife in the Olympia Theater. He became
smitten with her charms, and after repre
senting that he had "money to burn, he
asked her to become his bride. She read
ily consented, and it was agreed that they
would become man and wife the follow
ing day. Th<* ceremony was performed at
the appointed time and in deference to
the wishes of the bride. Greenhood went
to live with her In the apartments on
Grant avenue.
According to Mrs. flreenhood's story.
her husband the day after their marriage
accused her of flirting with other men
and smote her on the jaw. When she
objected, she says he drew a. revolver and
threatened to blow her brains out. Since
then they have had frequent quarrels,
and realizing that she could not live with
him on account of his intense Jealousy
the newly made bride decided to "call it
off." as she expressed it. She was pre
paring to leave him. when he became des
perate and resolved to murder her and
then cut his own throat.
It Is rot likely that Mrs. Greenhood will
prosecute her murderously inclined
spouse. After his release from prison last
evening she sent him a note, promising
to forgive him if he behaved himself In
the future. Prior to her marriage Mrs.
Greenhood was known as Mabel Pyne.
She Is a prepossessing young woman, "and

ONE THRILL
IN "AN ENEMY
TO THE KING"
A thrill always repays. Physical sensa
tion Is always worthy of patient await
ing, but patience Is sometimes appalling.
and Its reward, when it comes. Is merely
gratifying without being compensative.
"An Enemy to the King" Is not punctu
ated with sensations, which is less fie
fault of the author than of Mr. Frawley's
players, who vaporize the atmosphere of i
romance in which it should be cl>>ir.ed i
and act with occasional emphasis, but â 
without a telling accent. There are cli- :
maxes nullified by overdoing and overbal
anced by periods of lentor that are. inex- ;
cusable .n a drama of romance. Ibe ;
playwright has provided minor opportuni- â 
ties in plenty, but they are not seized by
Charles Marshall as Frojac. a very crude
ly humorous impersonation, nor "by Mr. '
Mathewo as the rodomont swashbuckler
Harbemouche, patently rehearsed, nor by
Mr. Frawley. whose acting makes us re
gret Salvlnl and Joe Haworth. who 's not
dead, but sleeping. Mary Hampton was
negligible for three acts, but at the end
arose to a point of what I must call femi
nine virility, and this brings me to the- i
thrill I was speaking of. The dual scene,
which Is saved for the last act, like an
annual circus in vaudeville, is well worked
up and admirably achieved by Mr. Fraw
ley and Harrington Reynolds, ably assist
ed by the tables and chairs, and it li tils
and this alone that will take us out of tne
present and Into the past.
PORTER GARNETT.
Alhambra.
The Alhambra Inaugurated the new
week with a Swede-Frenchy farce en
titled Mr. Plaster of Paris." One-half
appears to be a reincarnation of "Yon
Yonson." or "A Yenulne Yentleman."
while the other Is very reminiscent of
other farces. Altogether It Is a funny
concoction with considerable horse play
The company presenting this farce Is not
so badâ on the contrary there are one
or two really good players. One of them
la E. J. Bunkall. who Impersonates a
Swedish servant with adherence to the
rules laid down for character work, while
Edward Fell appeared to advantage in an
old man's role, which If specified on the
programme as Ahlnidab Hinks.
There was a slight mix-up in the first
act. It sterns that the company, without
; the knowledge of the management of the
theater. Introduced two specialties. One
of them was a buxom maiden with a two
by-four voice: that is to say. with a
melodramatic soprano. The gallery
seemed to enjoy this part of the per
formance hugely, for it called the young
woman all -sorts of pet names. Then
came a Chinese act. which was the most
aggravating exhibition presented on a
local stage for pome time. It is very
lucky for the Alhambra that these two
specialists received their walking papers
as a reward for their unique accomplish- !
ments. Without these two side shows the
play at the Alhambra Is fairly good.
ALFRED METZGER.
SWALLOWS CARBOLIC ACID.
Disheartened because of th* persistent
refusal of htr husband to contribute a
portion of his waces toward the support
of herself and their 7-year-old hoy, Mrs.
Joseph Hale of -â  Natoma street tried to
end her life by swallowing carbolic acid
at about 7 o'clock last nlpht. She was re
moved to the Receiving Hospital and
prompt treatment counteracted the ef
fects of tho poison co that she was soon
pronounced out of danKT by Dr. Dray
Fortunately comparatively little of the
add had been swallowed, but the unfor
tunate woman's face and breast were
badly burned by the fl*ry fluid.
Joe lie. the husband of the woman Is
an ex-soldier, having served in the Phil
ippines as a member of the First Califor
nia Volunteers. According to her Btory
he began to fleet her before he became
a patriot, and although he wrote her sev
eral letters from the Philippines he never
sent her any money. Since hi* return
from the Orient he has been employed on
t the Government transport dock, but his
wages were Fpent for liquor while his
wife labored over the washtub to support
herself and child. " l
Saturday Mrt Hale learned that her
husband was drinking- In a laloon near
the N.-itonia-streÂ»-t house and spending
monpy ' ply. That was the last straw
and after hroodlnc over her lot for twen
ty-four hours she decided that life whs
not worth tho struggle.
"I would have killed him If I could have
cot hold of him." she moaned a* she lay
on a cot In the Receiving Hospital last
night, "but I could not flnn him.

Boy Stowaways Home

ONE IS FROM MASSACHUSETTS

THE PHILIPPINES.
The Other Is a San Francisco Boy.
Both Were Disappointed Be
cause They Could Not

The transport Grant brought bark f>Â«Â»Tj
the Philippines two youngster* that had
a burning dÂ»-sire to meet death on a
battlefield. The lads stowed away on the
ship before she left San Francisco and
had to be put under a guard at Hollo In
order to prevent them from following
the regiment ashore. One of the hoys Col.
lowed tho Twenty-sixth from Massachu
setts, while thn other one oast In his lot
with the regiment In San Francisco.
Their names are Charley Messenger and
Walter Ehrhorn. Charley*! home Is in
Sherborn. Mass., and Walter's parents
live on Lombard street, this city. His
f.-.th.-r works in a shoe store on Market
Charley wanted to Â«Â»o to the Philippines
to fight. TValter went purely for the snk"
of adventure. When Charley wani<d to

i tain Baker refused to allow him because
he might Ret killed, the 12-year-old said:
"We have all to die. captain, and I
â¢would sooner die In my boots fighting lor
mv country than quietly In my bed at
home. My grandfather was killed fight
! ing for the Union and my father went
with the Fifth Regiment to Cuba, and I
; think now 1 have rome so far you should
i give me a chance to see some service in
the Philippines.' 1 Captain Baker was ob
durate, however, and Charley was placed
under a guard In order to keep him
aboard.
"I always wanted to he a soldier." said
Charley aboard the Grant yesterday.
â¢ My father was a member of Company H,
Fifth Infantry; and fought in Cuba. 1 We
used to talk war all the time and so I
i got It Into my head to form a company of
jmy own. I had one of my father's old
campaign hats, a pair of overalls and a
pair of leggings and with these on I used
to march at the head of my company. One
day we passed my mother and I called
i out. 'All aboard for the -Philippines.' My
mother laughed and said ,'All right, my
boy, goodby.*'. She was joking, but I was
in earnest.
"Next morning' I -dressed myself for
school, but Instead of going there (I was
In the sixth grade of the grammar
school) I took off my school, clothes and
hid them in the bushes and downed my
uniform. I then walked and ran twenty
live miles to Worcester, only to find the
Twenty-sixth gone. I applied. to Lieuten
ant Morris for transportation to dan
Francisco, telling' him I bad missed the ;
train and wanted to join my regiment.
He laughed at me and told me to go
home. I lied to him nnd said I had no
home and the only friends I had in the
world were with the Twenty-sixth.
"When 1 had told my story Mr. Morris

Then he posted the following tag on my
coat: 'Dear conductor. please forward
1 this bunch of humanity to Captain . 'red
, H. McDonald. Company M. Twenty-sixth
i Infantry, Presidio, San Francisco, 'al."
i Captain McDonald was captain of Com
. pany H of the Fifth and my father served
I under him In Cuba, where they became
i good friends. At Springfield. Mass., I was
[ put oft the train by the conductor and a
, Mr. Lyle paid my fare to Albany, N. V
! At Albany a Mr. Balsbury took charge cf
me and brought me to Amsterdam. There
They raised a subscription and paid my
way to San PrandSCO, besides giving me
I an outfit and some money to spend. Fr. m
Amsterdam I went to I'tica. to Buffalo
land then to Chicago. At Green River I
] lost all my pack during the change of
cars and landed in Ogden with only what
I stood in.
"At Ogden I bought a revolver, a round
about, fifty cartridges and a pair of log
gings. I still r- i.l my campaign hat I
met some 01 the boys from the Twenty
sixth, and with them I came on to San
Francisco. They took care of me at the
Presidio, and then. Just before camp

smuggled myself aboard the Grant. After
we got out to sea I was awful sick, and
when the chief officer found me I didn't
I care whether he threw me overboard or
nfit. I soon Â»rot better, and . nen Captain
i Baker, the army quartermaster, got the
carpenter to make Walter and I shoe
i black boxes and gave us an outfit, and
then we made some money shining shoes.
i At Honolulu the captain made us both
l write home, after which we were allowed
to go ashore. We had a good time, but
were careful to be back aboard the Grant
before she sailed.
"At Manila we were not allowed ashore,
and at Iloilo a guard was placed over us
, to prevent our escape. I was upon the
' forecastle head watching the boys fight
their awa** ashore and we could hear the

LAYING OUT
SCHEDULE OF
SCHOOL WORK
Teachers Confer on
the Subject.
INAUGURATION OF A NEW PLAN
FORMERLY PRINCIPALS ALONE
HAVE BEEN CONSULTED.
Superintendent Webster Believes Ex
cellent Results Will Be Gained
by Elimination of Waste
in Studies.
A conference has been held during the
past two weeks, at which Superintendent
Webster, his assistant, A. L. Jordan, and
the teachers in the department have been
present, with the object of adjusting the
work In the new Bchool schedule for the
forthcoming year. This conference is an
innovation, inasmuch as heretofore the
principals aJone of the various schools
have been consulted in laying out the
school work for pupils, and is unique in
the fact that the principals themselves
have requested the Superintendent to call
in the teachers to give their views on the
Important question, so that everything Is
harmonJotlt in connection with the inaug
uration of the new plan.
One of the gnat points that the Su
p< rlntendent has had in view Bince he
first took up the work has been to cut
out the waste In studies. The chief source
of waste in;- been in a *re.it dm asure due
to scheduling work for children th.i
beyond the grade In which the\
placed. The Superintendent has never re
ceived any CO-operatlon In liis endeavor
to properly lay out a course of studies
until the present Board of Education
t-ame into pow< r. This (â¢â  .ipl, compre
hending the object ai.'l it- Importance,
has sustained him In his effortl In this
regard, as well as in other directions.
H. retoforc the failure to judiciously ad
ju.-t the work In the School Department
has bean largi ly owing to not bringing
together the suggestors and execut.
the work for consultation as to the
meth. .ry to accomplish the best
results. Heretofore principals only have
been asked what would be suitable for
the children, but at the suggestion of
the principals themselves the Superin
tendent soon became aware that the best
plan was not to consult the principals
alone.
The first consideration was regarding
the- work prescribed by special teachers.
In the pursuance of his policy for the re
establishment and expansion of the work
relating to what is commonly known as
the good, old-fashioned "Three R's," or
what is practically the rudiments of an
education. Superintendent Webster was
obliged to fix a time limit in many of the
branches. Humane education, physiology
and other nature study he directed to be
given orally and by means of supplemen
tary reading. To music he assigned a
half hour weekly, and to sewing he al
lowed three-quarters of an hour every
week In such schools as taught that
branch of domestic economy.
â In order to adjust the work prÂ»scrlb*4
by the special teachers to the time
limit, the Superintendent Invited the at
tendance, first, of the representatives of
typical primary schools to his office for
the conferences, and secondly, of the
teachers in the grammar grades. At the
came time he found opportunities to dis
cuss the different phases of the work with
principals and heads of special depart
ments. However, the amount of work to
be done In the various grades he per
mitted to be specified by the class teach
ers themselves.
As an example of the method pursued
to eliminate the waste In studies at the
meeting of the primary teachers held one
night recently, a fifth-grade teacher re
quested that some of the problems In
arithmetic in her course be transferred to
a higher grade, but In order not to be ac
cused of lightening the work of her own
class she offered to trade these problems
for some work In fractions that she had
found by experience her pupils could do.
She explained her attitude by stating that
the problems were so much beyond the
capacities of her pupils that where It
consumed hours In grasping their diffi
culties, it would take but a few minute*
when the children were more mature fot
a full comprehension of the problems. The
exchange was agreed to, and thus the
first Installment of waste will be saved.
Another case to show the benefits of the
new method of laying out the course baa
been discovered in the fact that the teach
ers of one grade asked to be given some
of the more difficult work of the grade
below. When asked why they did not of
fer some other work in exchange for that
which they had taken, the statement wan
made that If more work was not given
to these lower grades the teachers thereof
would have the opportunity to give more
drill on the subjects they had. and the
schooling would thus be more thorough.
The prevailing sentiment among the
teachers of the eighth and ninth, or the
higher grades, is that they do not con
sider the amount of work given them to
do, and they are satisfied to have thÂ»
matter taken out of the lower grades and
given to them, provided the children came
to them properly prepared and In good
working mental condition for that which
was about to be taught to them.
"It Is the expression of these teach
ers," said Superintendent Webster. In dis
cussing the subject yesterday, "that by
pursuing the methods enumerated, they
will. if allowed to remain undisturbed,
be able to do at least one-half more work
In the nine grade* of the course In some
of the branches next year and twice the
amount in the year following. That Is,
providing promotions are made by the
department of supervision and sustained
by the Board of Education, on a sufficient
average percentage of the work In the
several grades. After this preparation
has been made I may expect to secure
from the high schools a preparation for
the universities that will enable them to
advance the standard of matriculation
and be supplied with better material thi>n
ever before.
"The teachers who have been Invited to
these conferences have been highly
pleased to take part in what might aptly
be termed "heart to heart talks' concern
ing the Interests of their charges. They
are unanimous In stating that this is the
first time In their experience that the
method has been pursued. I look for ex
cellent results to come from the Inaugura
tion of the plan."
