ONCE MORE OUR BOYS STEP FOOT ON NATIVE LAND
* Â» . * .- Â» Â» Â» . * - Â».. m*i
MY God, ain't it good to feel
California under your feet
a!"
The cry was almost hys
terical as a young soldier
stepped from he big transport Sher- I
man as she lay at Foisom-street wharf
yesterday morning. He was one of the |
first upon the gang-plank and thence ;
to the beard dock. A choking sensa
tion seemed to come in all the bronzed
throats of the boys as they heard him,
and eyes that had borne the blaze of
tropic suns unwinking were moist with
unshed tears as the returning heroes j
were brought to a full realization of
the fact that they once more trod their
native land.
This was the real home-coming. This 1
the end of the long and weary days of j
waiting. California was once more !
under their feet, and' the joy â the glad- j
ness of ii swept away all memories of
hardships of Luzon swamp and field. I
They were home and on the threshold
of the welcoming tribute such- as only
California can pay her sons.
At a very early hour the big trans- j
port swung into the berth and was
docked, ready for the disembarking of j
her precious load, but early as it was
there were many eyes aboard of her
that were open and many phantom
like forms crowded her bulwarks, anxi- j
ous to feel the first tremor of the
tuuch of home land. Just as the strid- j
tftt whistles of the city announced the
seventh hour, the first forms appeared j
in the gangway and the debarkation ;
began. For almost an hour the steady!
stream of humanity poured from . the
vessel's side, and company after com- I
pany lined up along the great dock \
and stood awaiting orders.
No Impatience was shown by the ,
Bturdy veterans. They had been
trained during those long hours at the '<
enemy's front to wait, and that train
ing stood them in right good stead â 
now when they were about to reap the '
fruits of their ' long and wearisome .
campaign. For fifteen months they j
had been away fighting for the honor \
of their country, and in fifteen minutes ;
more they would be in the welcoming
arms of relatives or friends who were
assembled by thousands and tens of
thousands just outside the big fence
also waiting, but with far less pa
tience.
It was a wise decision that precluded
a greeting on the dock, for the brief
â wait gave j time to recover â¢ from the
momentary weakness which had
brought lumps to the throat and tears
to the eyes. After the Governor had
taken from his pocket, and read the
typewritten- address which had been
prepared for him, the pathos of it all
had passed away, and the smart com
mand of -attention" brought the men
quickly into position and the band
swung into place at the head of the
column, which marched with steady
tramp and set faces out toward those
who were waiting outside.
There was little cheering as the
column came in sight. There was a
I thing which was too deep for
cheers which was a more eloquent wel
come than all the huzzas that could
have emanated from thousands of
throats.
â  Yes, it was good to feel California
under foot once more, and when the
little woman with the babe in her arms
recognized the man' who had gone
forth from her fireside at his country's
call a great sigh that was almost a
sob evinced the sympathy of the vast
crowd as army rules and regulations
were set at naught, while husband and
wife were close clasped in each other's
arms and their mingled tears fell on
the wondering face of the child too
young to understand what it all meant.
Then humanity asserted itself and
police regulations as enforced by stal
wart bruecoats were swept aside while
the dun of the khaki was absorbed into
the homogeneous mass of color, as the
immense throng swarmed into the
board roadway and mingled with the
loved ones who had returned from the
jaws of death.
"Jack! Jack! My God. he's hurt.'
What was one fainting woman in a
crowd like that? The poor mother's
pent-up feelings found vent in that
despairing cry. and her unconscious
body was borne through the throng
which had no time for sentiment other
than the selfish one of a struggle to

get close to its own loved ones.
Fathers, mothers, sisters and broth
ers forgot all else except that their
own had come back, and as the swell
ing tide of humanity rolled on toward j
the great depot where heavily laden j
tables groaned in waiting, it seemed |
as if the surging waves would over- j
whelm the stately edifice in their im- j
patience. All semblance of column
formation was lost, and at times it
looked as if no earthly power could
bring order out of the chaos which
reigned in the ' street. But gradually
the excess of emotion exhausted itself,
and BloWly the long line was re-formed
and the steady tramp resumed until j
the steps leading into the grand nave |
of the building were reached. Here
again were the scones of the street en
acted. The thronging relatives could
not bear to be parted even for a few
minutes from those who had been so
long away, and hysterical rushes were
made by women who forget everything
except that they wanted to feel again i
the touch of the dear hand and look
again into the precious faces of those j
who had gone forth to danger and had j
been returned living and loving.
Tears and kissep. sobs and nervous
laughter, hugs and hand-clasps were
the vent of fueling, and slowly the
column was permitted to pass within
the portals where the feast spread by
loving hands awaited it. ';

Eternal Stews of the Transport

THE emotions crowded into that
short march of three blocks from the
transport dock to the Tiburon ferry
stairs were still manifesting themselves
in the faces of the volunteers and their
happy relatives when the presence of
the civil law stepped in to separate the
soldier from his hysterical relatives.
As fast as the company officers could
get their men into any sort of forma

could forget the eternal and infernal
"stew, stew, stew" of the Sherman and
make their first "square" meal in many
a long day. â 
Festooned with sweet peas, pinked
and geraniumed, the returned heroes
ascended two by two to the grand nave, !
to be met by still other relatives than
those from whom they had been stpa
rated below, by brothers and Bisters,
sweethearts and wives; to be kissed and
hugged and patted again and thumped;
to be laurel wreathed and cheered, and

bevies of pretty girls. Home again?
Well, they should smile! Anything
like it anywhere else in the whole, wide
world? Nit!
And while those that had ascended
first were mingling with the happy
crowds, and while still others of the
regiment and the batteries were slowly
parting from the throngs below, the
ladies in charge of the breakfast ar
rangements were putting the finishing
tpuches on the longest tables on earth.
There were six of them, three in the
north wing and three in the south wing
of the eastern corridor, each five hun
dred feet long. In the central space,
connecting with the grand nave through
the great raised doorways, were ar
ranged at right angles short tables for
the officers and for the Mayor and in
vited guests. To the rear of these, sep
arated from the eager crowds in the
! north and south corridors of the great
nave by high grills, was an orchestra.
The tables were artistically decorated.
Cloths of spotless white stretched as
far as the eye could see. Above them
were masses of flowers, festooned ever
greens and drooping ferns. Each of
fourteen sections, marked by a silken
banner lettered to correspond with the
letter of the company or battery for
which it had been set apart, bore in
its center an elaborate floral piece rep
resent ing guns stacked. The table to
the east of the center, reserved for
Colonel Duboce and other officers, was
specially decorated. Hanging on the

and carnations. At the head of the
table itself was an American eagle
above a floral shield, across which had

inscription, "You will find us ready."
The arrangement ol napery. glass and
china was as tasteful as could be. and
the general effect was heightened ad
mirably by the soft morning light
streaming through the wealth of win
dows facing the bay. To serve the
members of each company had been
assigned, or rather had been selected
from any number of volunteers, a num.
ber of pretty young women, relatives
of the soldiers they were so glad to see
again. They were on hand even be
fore the boys had marched on to the
cobbles of East street, making ready
for their coming, and as dearly as they
would have loved to mingle in the
crowd to greet the loved ones they held
their desires in abeyance, comforting
themselves with the knowledge that
they would soon have them for their
very own, for an hour at least, far
from the smothering throng. They
could hear the hum of the happy voices
outside, and they knew their time was
coming. The ladies In charge of the

All things come to those who wait
and a few minutes after 9 o'clock the
mess call was sounded by the company
buglers and the boys, who were none
the less hungry for all the excitement
through which they had just passed.
Bled Into the banqueting room through
the great door at the nortnern end.
Laurel wreaths for the glory they had
won awaited them at the very thres
hold. The ladies of Seven Pines Circle,
G. A. R., had fashioned the circlets of
bay for their heroes, and a committee
composed of Mrs. J. Mary Benley. Mrs.
J. Albert Noble, Mrs. Goodell and Mrs.
Julia Duhen, handed them over to the
pretty girl relatives to bestow. They
did It with a will, many of them with a
hug and a kiss, and not a soldier was
allowed to pass without his meed of
the green aureole of victory.
It took less time than it takes to tell
to seat each company of soldiers. The
great corridor filled up with the flower
covered, brown-clad- men, the daintily
clad handmaidens to the young gods
of war moved in serried lines, there
was a clattering of dishes, a clinking
of glasses, the jingle of knives and
forks and spoons, smoke curled from a
thousand steaming cups of coffee, and
the feast was on.
How the veterans fell to! How they
charged the trenchers and mowed
down the fields of lettuce. They went
at the double quick through the
oysters and the relishes and attacked
the turkey and the barnyard fricasee
en the run, Walsh's band very
thoughtfully playing at this stage of
the sortie, "Who say dat chicken in dis
crowd?"
What appetites they had! What
elasticity was displayed by stomachs
no longer fearful of the "stew" of the
Sherman! It was marvelous, even if
suggestive of a certain bicycle ad.
wherein "digestion waits on appetite
and health on both." It was worth
twice the price of admission, once to
the boys who were experiencing again
the joys of a table in civilization and
pig IPS JBISSPISa?S3RSS?I^^^SÂ§
once for the spectators who witnessed
the onslaught.
There were some late-comers to the
feast, notably Colonel .Duboce and
Chaplain McKinnon, who had been de
tainfd outside by the press of people
desirous of clasping their hands. They |
got through at last, flanked by other j
members of the regimental staff, and !
as they went down to the officers' I
table they were loudly cheered all !
along the line. Notwithstanding their j
rank hunger gnawed at their vitals as
If did at those of the high private, and ;
they stretched their legs undar the !
board with avidity.
At the head of the central table were j
seated Mayor Phelan and A. M. Law

mittee, Mr. and Mrs. John F. Mefrill, j

nearly a year, were guests at tho
colonel's table. Miss Garlick was with
the Californians from the start and
has ministered to them during their
service. Every man in the regimt nt
has a high regard for the little woman
because of her kindness to them whiir*
in hospital. As the volunteers entered
the breakfast hall they greeted her
with handshakes and pleasant words
as if they had not seen her for som-;
time. Although it was their usual cus
tom, their greetings attracted atten
tion to the nurse. *Miss Clarlick was
attired in a military dress of the same
material used in the uniforms of th*
volunteers. Dr. Beere was the first
woman to be granted permission by
the War Department to go to the
Philippines as a nurse. She returned
on the Sherman.
For a full half hour nothing was al
lowed to interfere with the stocking of
the commissary of the department of
the interior, not even the presence of
half a dozen photographers with
cameras as big as Krupp guns. One
course after another was pursued <>n

under the heading of dessert, to the
word "cheese." Being soldiers, accus
tomed to obeying commands, and hav
ing no more holes in their belts to let
out, they did so.
Then from the far end of the cor
ridor came sounds of cheering. "Rah!
rah! rah!" The boys of a company
seated there were cheering the sisters
and mothers and wives and sweet
hearts who had waited on them. The
idea took like wildfire, and down tlio
long line came a succession of cheers
from the other companies for the re
spective groups of younu women who
had feasted them. There is an end to
everything, and the breakfast was no
exception to the rule. At a few
minutes past 10 o'clock the last volun
teer had arisen, fortified for the march
through the city. The Colorado regi-
mental band, which had come in dur
ing the breakfast, played a selection
while the boys were again exchanging
greetings with their new-found friends
and readjusting their belts to the new
conditions beneath. Miss Preciosa
Pracht, whose brother is a member of
Company M, First California Volun
teers, was heard on the cornet in a
number of patriotic airs, accompanied
by the Coloradans.
By this time it was half-past 10
o'clock, the hour set for the starting
of the triumphal march through the
city, and the men, broken up into
groups by their friends and relatives,
made their way downstairs, to be
greeted again by waiting crowds, to
be kissed and patted, hugged and
thumped and pelted with flowers and
cheered and cheered again. It needed
not the sign of "Welcome" on the ferry
front to let them know they were.
THROUGH THE
CITY STREETS
IT is worth a year of war, worth all
the horrors of the trenches, all the
sufferings of the hospital, worth
death itself, to march up the streets of
a city and meet such a welcome as
awaited the boys from across the sea.
No hardship is too heavy, no waiting
too long, if it lead to such a swirl of
wild enthusiasm. It started when the2

ELECTRICAL ILLUMINATION
IS GREATLY ENDANGERED
THE executive committee appeals to every citizen to assist the polio*
detail in preventing the small boys and others from climbing the tele
graph poles along Market street during- the electric illumination this
evening. Aside from the danger of being severely injured or ;
killed from contact with live electric wires there is great liability of
â  damaging the plant of the display.
Yesterday while the parade was pasajng Kearny street the wires were
bj people climbing on the polea and the lamps of one section of the
display were burned out.
Chief Leea has been, notified by the Mayor to give special Instructions to
(he officers who will be detailed <>n Market street to-day to arrest for ma-
Icious mischief any one attempting to climb on the poles. The police clafm
that they will be unable to carry out these instructions without the asfllst
â¢ the citizens, as they will have their hands-: full handling the crowd.
men filed from the breakfast room, and
it had not ended even when the parade
was over and the people had sought
their homes.
From the breakfast hall the men
marched, back to the. dock. There the
line was formed, and at the bugle-call
the pates were opened. a,nd the troops
marched out into the crowd. East
street was a dense mass of people too
tightly packed to move, and through
such a throng the troops forced their
way to Market street It was not a
quiet march. Every whistle -was
screeching, every bell was ringing,
every man, woman and child was
cheering and yelling, and when the
head of the column turned int.-* Market
street friendship would be denied no
longer and the people blocked the line.
It took half the police force to open
the way again, and by. that time the
escort had moved into place and the
column was ready.
Up the street the people were ready,
too. From ; the ferry to Van :Ness
avenue Market street was a sight to
see. Along the sidewalks the streams
of people had long before been forced
to stand. There was no going back
after starting down, and sown there
was no "going forward. The people
worked toward the water front until
the street would hold no more, and
then the police pressed back the crowds
until they seemed one with the build
ings on either side.
At the newspaper corner there has
never been such a jam. The committee
had the stand erected by Lotta's foun
tain, but it absorbed no space, for the
crowd had worked In under it, and,
tearing the drapery from its front, the
people hoisted themselves up among its
supports and hung there until the last
man had gone by. In the triangle be
tween the three meeting streets was a
solid crowd, and across on the Third
street corners there was room for not
one more. On either side there was not
a window but was thick with heads,
and the fire escapes, overhanging cor
nices and fire walls each had their
knots of people. The altitude or frail
ness of the structure was no objection
so long as it afforded a view of the
street and the column upon it.
The overworked police sweltered un
der the strain of their exertions. The
crowd was good-natured but as per
sistent as the flight of time. It was
like pressing a rubber balloon to drive
the crowd back, for when pushed in in
one place it bulged out in another, and
even the ropes stretched across the
cross streets aided the bluecoats but
little. The mounted police had whips,
and it soon became necessary to use
them with unsparing hand, and with
those and the clubs and the horses'
hoofs a thin, crooked line of pavement
was kept open.
At every available place reviewing
stands had been erected, and these were
filled long before the parade hove in
sight There was a large one in the
pace where Battery street runs into
Market. The committee had sent in
vitations to several notable guests, and
most of these were in this stand. Among
the most distinguished of the guests
was Governor Steunenberg of Idaho,
who is here to make arrangements for
the reception of the Idaho men when
they reach home. He was in the stand
with several members of his staff as
the guests of the executive committee.
As a matter of fact, had he^ received
proper courtesy, he should have been
in the parade as the guest of the Gov
ernor. It is etiquette for the chief ex
ecutive of one State to make a visiting
Governor his guest at such a celebra
tion as was held yesterday, for as the
guest of the Governor can he find his
only appropriate place in line. But
Governor Steunenberg has received no
executive courtesies from the Governor
of California, and so he viewed the
parade from the midst of the crowds.
Just below Montgomery street the
head of the escort was waiting, the red
plumes of the artillerymen teasing the
crowds into straining their necks and
spreading premature reports that the
parade had actually started. General
Shafter and his staff, gorgeous in gold
braid and cocked hats, capered and
pranced around upon their horses, while
the people speculated as to which of
the gaily uniformed riders was Colonel
Duboce. Then as they looked the gen
eral and his staff wheeled Into line
ahead of the band, of the Third Artil
lery. The musicians piped the opening
bars of a march, and the .column
moved.
It was supposed the people would get
back and let the leading horsemen
pass, but they did nothing of the kind.
There were no police to head the line;

ev< ry one of them, even to the mounted
pojfce from the park, was earning his
salary in the crowds, so the genera!
and hia staff had to make way foi
themselves. The line came up on the
north side of Market, and with a howl
"f apprehension all those on the south
side ruined across to find a new and
; beitcr position. They left a small wedge
of street, beginning with the general's
staff and ending on the sidewalk in

they stayed. Only the fear of being
trampled upon by the oncoming horses

; well, although frequent halts told at
i difficulties at the head and flying
; horsemen brought forward news of de
; lays in the rear. Twice before they
reached Sansome street the volunteers
had to halt to untangle themselves

them over an hour to Teach Kearny.

followed by the rumbling guns of\the
liMht batteries, with the cavalry com
ing after. Then came the National
Guard, with General Dickinson at its
head, and the Governor following after
with the Legislature. The Legislature
was not appreciated. The people
thought the legislators were but ordi
nary mortals who had been given per
mission to march in the parade, and
unwilling to allow others an additional
privilege, the crowds took aftM- the
1 lawmakers and the police had to draw
their clubs again.
The legislators marched in all the
' dignity of office-holders, scanning the
crowds for friends that they might be
saluted and might salute in return.
They had one chance, at least, for 'as
they passed the "yellow" building they
locked upward and were rewarded by
seeing Mr. Herrin himself sitting in
his office window on the sixth floor.
Thj re was no one to give the order,
but the maneuver was excellently ex
ecuted. With one accord the legis
lators bowed deferentially, and one or
two. forgetting the altitude of the
window, tipped their hats and said
pleasantly "Good morning, Mr. Her
rin." Mr. Herrin bowed affably and
the legislators moved on.
The Fifth Regiment marched well
and with full ranks. Behind it was
the Naval Reserve with a four-gun
battery, the whole under command of
Captain L. H. Turner. They came
steadily after their band, the gold
stripe denoting service in the late war
decorating the arms of the many who
responded to the call. The militia
caviilry ended the escort.
There was an interval in the line
after the escort had passed. No one
tried to hlock the street, no one tried
to force his way forward. It needed
no word to tell that the boys were
coming, for the cheer that started with
them at tho dock was flying on b<
thÂ»m. Down the street the glint of
their brown uniforms could, be Been
among the people, easily distinguished
in the sea of humanity in which they
moved. The lively air the band was
playing was drowned in the roar of
welcome. The drums rolled their
loudest, but they were no match for
the frenzied people. It was not a cheer
nor a shout. It was as a single voice
calling from the heart of the multi
tude, all-pervading, overpowering, and
before it even the shrieking steam
seemed silent.
Colonel Duboce with his staff rode
ahead, and his progress was marked
by the ripple of the handkerchiefs and
flags that sprang to life as the regi
ment moved forward.

was another part of the escort, includ
ing the Colorado Regiment, under
Colonel -McCoy, and behind them
! the League of the Cross Cadets. The
I Colorado Regiment came from the
Presidio early in the morning and were
ready at the dock when the California
boys came back from the breakfast.
â¢>n the way through the streets the
Colorado men were greeted with the
greatest enthusiasm, for there has al
n ays been the friendliest feeling
between them and the California men,
and they have fairly earned the recog
nition they received. The Colorado
I men have taken active interest in the
home-coming of the boys from heVe.
They have helped decorate the streets
and were eager to volunteer for a place
in the escorts. They went out to the
Presidio with the boys and saw them
! safely quartered before seeking their
: own tents.
It was wild down the street, but it
\\ as pandemonium when the volunteers
: reached Lotta's fountain. How BUCfa
cheer-maddened people can ever get
back their sanity is hard to comprehend.
How merely human throats can stand
! such a strain and still be able to tell of
it is a mystery. How the sight of a
!>rn wn-clad soldier, even if he be our
own and just come home, can so com
pletely drive the wits from 10,000 peo
; pie is something too deep for explana
tion. There was no stopping the rush.
|no silencing the roar. Like maniacs
; they pranced nut into the street, swing
ing h;its and handkerchiefs and flags,
and. surrounding the colonel, they held
him and the column behind, until they
! had yelled themselves into exhaustion.
Duboce could not go on, and neither
; could any of his men. Those around
him were not all friends, but he com
manded the regiment, and the regiment
was theirs, and just behind his men
were the men of the California Artil
lery, and they belonged to the people,
too, so tiny howled and yelled to their
hearts' content, while the column be
hind waited and that ahead drew away.
There was no help for it. Duboce had
' to send for assistance, and the regiment
! so long engaged in beating its foes had
to.be rescued from its friends by the
â  cavalrymen. They came on into the
| crowd with their horses, and through
; the meager opening they made the
; regiment passed.
It was a straggling line. Hemmed in
by the crowds on both sides, the ranks
1 dotted with relatives and friends, and
; the cadence of the drums lost in the mad
: tumult, the troops struggled on past
; the committee-stand, until, weary of
their excitement, the people were will
' ing to draw back and give them tho
width of the tracks.
It was so at every gore corner until,
the cavalrymen proving too few t'">
keep the way open, the staff officers
rode their horses over to the sides of
the column and marched along In that
earnest though undignified formation.
At Fourth street there was another
jam and another wait, and then at
Fifth there was almost a repetition. As
the column proceeded the people were
not content with only shouting, sn
small cannon, firecrackers, shotguns
and pistols, and everything strong
enough to hold exploding powder, were
brought into play to swell the undi
minishing chorus. The people In the
old armory of the First Regiment, on
Market street, near Tenth, wore par
ticularly boisterous. It was like a for
tress, for from every window shot
flame and -smoke and noise, and be
tween every salvo the delighted cheers
of the garrison filled the street.
On and on the column went with Its
accompaniment of enthusiasm. Like a
field of wind-swept, waving grain, the
heads of the people would sway and
toss at every fresh burst of sound.
They could hear but not se,e, .and the
wave of craning necks would run up
the street like a willywaw on the
water; then as the volunteers would
come in sight the hats and flags would
leap into life and the cheers would
whirl around the soldiers until it al
most took the wreath-wrapped hats
from their heads.
The St. Nicholas Hotel was alive with
flags, but it was not at them the colonel
WOM looking as the regiment came
along. He glanced from window to
window until on one on the lower floor
his eye rested, and then with a smile
he bowed and raised his hat to where
a handkerchief was fluttering hyster
ically. It was Mrs. Duboce who
waved it.
Behind the First Regiment the artil
lerymen were getting the same recep
tion. There was more than enough
enthusiasm for them all, and Major
Rice and his staff and his sturdy men
were the theme of more calls of wel
come and the excuse for more cheers.
At Van Ness avenue the column
Jurned to the north and marched on be
tween living walls. On the west side
of the street, just in front of Market,
the letter carriers had formed a line,
and they saluted many in the passing
ranks who had been of their number.
It was the children's opportunity on
Van Ness, and they took full advantage
of it. There was not a doorstep but
was full from sidewalk to hallway and
from banister to banister; and the
windows and the cornices above the
j doors, and the fence posts and tele
graph poles, all had their burdens of
people and were centers of noise. The
I prettiest sight of all was the steps of
: the Cathedral. The broad flags of the
: great stairway were covered with a gay
â¢ throng, each with a flag or a handker
-1 chief and all looking for the slightest
; occasion to wave it frantically in the
I air. The looked for opportunity came
with the volunteers, and right royally
! did they respond; and Father McKin-
I non, riding with the regimental staff,
j reined in his horse and looked back at
! the church steps with a smile. There
was none of the solemnity of a house
i of worship; the Cathedral had all the
air of a holiday.
At Bush street was the reviewing
stand, and there Major General Shafter
I and his staff turned out. He wasÂ»
I joined by the committee in a carriage,
i General Dickinson and his staff and
the Governor and his staff. The escort
marched by, and then as the First
Regiment came up Colonel Duboce and
Adjutant Curzon took their places to
tho right of General Shafter while the
regiment was being reviewed. Then
Major Rice took his place by the gen-
eral while the batterymen followed on
after the regiment. Beyond the review
ing station the escort had been drawn
up in line, and as the column passed
the line saluted and every band played.
There were many tunes, but one band
had the tact to select "Home, Sweet
Home," and the boys stopped to give
it a cheer as they went by.
On down Van Ness the welcome was
the same. The cheer was not so loud
nor deep, but it had the shrill, childish
treble that was absent from the roar
of the downtown crowd. All who could
not brave the crush saw the parade on
the avenue, and the crowd there was
brighter, gayer, happier, than that
along Market street. Ladies pre
dominated, and they were dressed in
all the colors of the season. The crowd
that lined the avenue was like the
patterns of a kaleidoscope, like a bit
of a rainbow, caught and held for the
boys in brown. On the vacant lots be
yond Clay street the children held
boisterous sway, and on a high hill on
the corner of Filbert the people had
climbed up and they hung on the
slopes like goats.
At Lombard the column turned west
ward again and headed for the Pre
sidio. Up the street the artillery es
cort was waiting, and as the volun
teers caught up it led the column along.
Discipline was relaxed as soon ac
Ix>mbard street was reached, and
friends, who had been driven from the
ranks after reaching the avenue, were
, allowed to go back again. They crowd
ed among the soldiers, carrying haver
i sack, rifle or canteen as the humor
seized them. The soldiers carried
everything but their blankets, and so
the assistance was not unwelcome.
Then the better to ease the boys route
| step was ordered, and the column
broke into an irregular straggle of
soldiers, citizens and their wives and
sons and daughters.
It was this way until just before the
head of the column reached the Pre
sidio. The band of the Third Artillery
had drawn to one side and the volun
teers straightened their ranks and
came to attention as they passed
through the gate to a stirring quick
step.
Inside the gate there was another
crowd as big as ever. People who had
seen the parade downtown hurried to
the cars and went to the Presidio to
meet the troops there, and they were
packed along the road, on the build
ings and up into the camp where the
men were to go. Through the crowd
the boys forced their way, and they
were halted among the tents that for
a while are to be their home.
They are camped up on the hill over
looking the old parade plain and com
manding a magnificent view of the
bay; up where the west wind can bring
the light back into their eyes and the
flush of health into cheeks grown thin
I and sallow, as pretty a spot as the
' beloved hills of their city can afford
jthem; a place where they can find rest
j and peace after their weary months of
', hardship.
The work of assigning the men to
I quarters took but little time, consid-
e ring the crowds that filled the corh
i pany streets and stood in the way of
the soldiers. The men arrived at the j
camp about half past 2, and as quickly {
j as possible Colonel Duboce had his reg
i imt-nt separate into battalions and each
battalion took possession of its tents.
The artillery men were marched direct
j to their company street and were at
j once at home.
The tents occupied by the California
J men are those to the east of the hill
! camp. The tents farthest to the east
Colonel Duboce considered the best,
j and he therefore assigned Tnis first
' battalion to them. This puts the .right
j of the line on the left of the camp, for
i the camp is regarded from the line of
; headquarters tent. It is optional with
I the commander, however,, and makes no
difference, as each battalion forms in
its own street and the regiment forms
on the parade ground.
As it now is the first battalion is in
the first street, reckoning from the res
ervation fence. The second is in the
second street and the third battalion in
i the third street. Then comes the artil
i lery men in the fourth street.
Camp life will not be onerous for the
boys. They will be able to spend more
time in the city than they will in camj>,
j for they will be given even more lib
erty, if possible, than the other volunv
teers. The other volunteers not having
any homes to go to were able, without
'losing anything, to report twice a day.
j With the California men, however, in
view of the fact that they are residents
of this city, it may be that they will
be given furloughs that will allow them
to practically live at home. This, how-
I ever, is a matter that rests with Gen
i eral Shafter. It may be found that too
much liberty will delay the muster out,
and in that case the liberty will have
to be sacrificed for a little while longer.
The first hours of freedom were not
long in coming, for as. soon as the men
were settled everybody but the small
guard were given a furlough until 10
o'clock this morning. With that privi
lege in view it did not take the boys
long to settle down. They went to their
tents quickly and stowed their arms
and accouterments and were ready for
home. When they were settled they
were let go, and the brown-coated men
lost no time in getting into the city.
Last evening the camp was deserted;
there were no men and no officers, an-1
a small guard from the Colorado men
kept watch over their effects.

DISCHARGED SOLDIERS
WILL BE CARED FOR
SINCE the outbreak of the war with Spain the Red Cross Society of the
United States has done immeasurable good for the defenders of the flag.
In this State the organization has had, the burden of looking after the
thousands of soldiers who have left these shores for the Philippines, and
it has accepted It all without a murmur. A great deal has been
printed about the splendid services the humane society has done the
boys In blue in the Philippines ar,d that the volunteers and regulars
appreciated the many kindnesses extecded them was emphasized at the break
fast reception given by the parents and relatives of the returned Californians.
Mrs. Willard B. Harrington and Mrs." John F. Merrill, presidents respect
ively of the State and local Red Cross societies, were guests at the occasion
and when Major Rice of the California Heavy Artillery marched in a.C the
head of his fine body of soldiers he met The ladies and enthusiastically spoke
of the good work accomplished by the nurses and money furnished by the
society.
The Red Cross Society has not rested on its laurels; on the contrary it is
still busily engaged caring for the soldiers. It has a reception tent in Union
Square, where the volunteers are always welcome. The following notice
signed by Mrs. .Harrington and Mrs Merrill was ordered yesterday to be in
serted in the newspapers:
"All discharged soldiers will receive every care and attention by apDhine
at the Red Cross tent in Union Square." v â¢ s
sympathetic feeling of a common citi
zenship felt and honored the deeper tie
of family. They seemed ea^er to show
their appreciation of the gallant sol
diers, and it was a merry, laughing,
happy rout that made its way from the
military reservation into the city. The
cars were crowded to their greatest ca
pacity. Men and women vied with each
other in showing courtesies to the
bronzed and tired boys of the Golden
State.
Mothers, wives and sweethearts were
proud that their loved ones had come
back from the wars unharmed and
with honors well won. The throngs
chattered nervously, hysterically in a
babel of sound. There were thousands
of questions to ask and myriads of
answers to give. The boys were deco
rated with wreaths and flowers, show
ered with compliments and congratu
lated as they had never been before.
Few of them perhaps ever thought of
the deep, 'serious interest with which
their every movement had been fol
lowed in the long dreary months of
danger and death in the Philippines.
Few perhaps realized until yesterday
that San Franciscans, independent of
ties of blood and friendship, felt an in
tense personal interest in the fortunes
of their soldiers, but the triumphal
march from the Presidio to the homes
of the city proved how deeply had been
impressed upon the minds of San Fran
ciscans the meaning of war when it is
brought to our every doors.
As every car passed from the reser
vation into the city it was cheered
j gladly on its way. Then the crowds
| broke up into little groups each taking
I its separate way to homes that had
] long been waiting in eager anticipation
I and with hope that trembled in fear of
every dispatch from the seat of war-.
Homes gayly adorned for the home
coming, glad, happy faces, aglow with
excitement and happiness told the story
of how California's soldiers passed
back to their plane of citzenship and
prepared to forget what of suffering
and trial they had endured in the ser
vice of their country.
Feasts we.re spread in every house
hold and there the returning veterans j
found the consummation' of what they!
had longed for so long, the reunion that j
the hazard of war made improbable, j
And in some homes there was sadness j
and silence. There was weeping for j
the cherished ones that did not come
home, for those that fell on distant bat- j
tie fields and sleep in far away cities j
of the dead. In the loud acclaims, the .
joyous welcome, the sights and sounds
of happiness that lllled the city there
were pangs of bitter grief for those
whose only pride is the dread one that j
an honored death can inspire.
As the afternoon wore on the soldiers
came again from their homes. They
had been the centers of admiring, ap
plauding coteries of friends, who had
broken into the home circle to inter
rupt its scenes with congratulations
and glad greetings. And then they
flocked to the main thoroughfares of
the city to congratulate each other, to
swell the burden of sound, to mingle
With the great masses Ol humanity
which surged through the streets and
accepted even the suspicion of an op
portunity to cheer and cheer again
Wherever a volunteer of California
appeared he was provocation for a dem.
onstration. It didn't make any differ
ence whether you knew him or not
somebody else, did, and that was
enough for a hearty greeting and well
wishes. All day long the crowds moved
through the streets of the city im.
pelled to catch the spirit of the day
and share its enthusiasm. Then as
twilight came a quiet spread over the
city. The throngs grew smaller and
smaller as the darkness came, until
San Francisco assumed something of
its normal aspect.
Everybody was prepared for the rev.
elry of the night. There was an inter
val of rest and then San Francisco
burst forth again in wild jubilation for
the return of her soldiers. Shortly be
fore 8 o'clock the city was the scene
of a transformation far more -brilliant
than any other in its history. Dark
ness had settled down over Market
street. The street lamps served little
more than to intensify the shadow?.
From every part of the town people
were hastening in eager anticipation
toward Market street. The cars were
black with people, whose destination
was the main avenue of the city.
Suddenly a stream of fire seemed to
start from the water front and waved
out Market street. Streamers of elec
tric lights flashed and glistened from
one end of the street to the other.
Thousands upon thousands there were
of them, illuminating the broad thor
oughfare block after block. It was a
spectacle of gorgeous light. In a mo
ment the watching throngs saw the
great ferry depot emergp from the
darkness a blazing tower of light. Out
lined against the sky was the splendid
dome of the City Hall glittering in
thousands of lights. San Francisco
had surpassed herself In doing honor
to her sons.
And then the babel of sounds was
resumed. It was without parallel. Peo
ple jostled and crowded in good natured
enthusiasm. Wherever a California
Volunteer showed himself there were
cheers and cheers again. . Horns,
whistles, bombs, noise producing instru
j ments of endless variety made a merry
din, and so it continued far Into the
night. The people of the city were glad
beyond ordinary means of expression
that their boys were back again, on
the streets of their own city and in the
homes that probably never will lose
'] them again through the fortunes oÂ£
j war.
SCENES ALONG
LINE OF MARCH
Pathetic incidents marked the lons
journey from the ferry to the Presidio.
Mothers broke through the line to clasp
in loving embrace sons who had long been
absent, and others stood by with tearful
eyes and hands outstretched to give greet
ing to the passing heroes.
Down at the ferry an aged woman gayly
decorated with silk flaps stood, weeping
tears of bitter sorrow as the regiment
swung into Market street. She held in
her hand a bouquet of flowers, and she
tossed thorn one by one into the ranks as
the boys pasted by. They were intended
for her only son, in whose honor her lit
tle home on Sixteenth street was dec
orated.
The brave lad has been sleeping in the
little cemetery at Negros for over four
months, and his mother did not learn the
sad tidings of his death until she went
down to the ferry yesterday morning.
"You'll have to pet <uit of that line,
I madam." said a his. husky policeman to
a woman who was walking along East
street alongside one. of the boys. "Come,
madame, get out of here; this is no place
; for you," repeated the officer in com-
I manding tones, as he iaid his hands on
i the woman and tried to hustle her out of
the line.
"Say, dis is my mudder," retorted the
soldier in a rich south-of-the-slot accent;
"and she kin walk on any ground wot
.holds me. See?"
The policeman "saw," and* the woman
walked triumphantly with her son till
i they reached Market street, where the
i captain ordered her out of the line.
I Out at Van Ness avenue the boys of the
1 old First Regiment assembled to give
I the returning heroes a hearty welcome.
i High up on a pedestal they placed the
i ancient regimental bass drum, on which
| was lettered "First Regiment. N G C."

dated back to the time of Noah.

ECHOES OF THE
MARINE PARADE
â¢ The main topic <->f conversation along
the water front yesterday was the mag
nificent day and night display on the bay in
honor of the returning volunteers. It was
the consensus of opinion among shipping
men that no sYich exhibition has ever been
witnessed anywhere, and Commodore
Bpreckels was the recipient of numerous
compliments fur th<> consummate skill
with which he supervised the water pa
r;ul<-. It was entirely owing to his able
management that tho proceedings went
off without a single accident, and the fact
is noteworthy.
Harbor Commissioners Kilburn, HeroW
and Harney. Secretary English. Chief
Wharfinger Henderson and his assistant,
Of-orge. Dryden, performed yeoman service
in connection with the celebration, and
too much praise cannot be accorded to
them and to Al Pryor of Piper, Aden &
Goodall, whose arrangements for the
"Night on 'Krisco Bay" were such an un
qualified success.
All the gentlemen named rested on their
laurels yesterday, and congratulations
poured in upon them by mall, telephone
and word of mouth, to all of which they
responded with their native modesty.
< "ommissloniT Harold, when asked how
much money would be turned over to the :
executive committee as proceeds from the
excursion boats, replied that a conserv
ative estimate would be between J2OOO and
$3000, and he would not be surprised if the
latter sum would be exceeded.
"v 1 1 the returns are not yet In," said
Mr Herold, "but we anticipate that all
the tickets have been Bold. There were
about 6000 tickets printed, so the sum may
be easily calculated.
"The Harbor Commissioners, In whose
hands the bay display was placed, are
jubilant at the outcome, and they desire
to express their thanks and grateful ap
preciation fo all the shipping men who so

: lnrs* loss to them, but they cheerfully
i turned over the boats and. not satisfied
1 with that, contributed their time and
money to make th,e undertaking the cmi
i nent success that it was.
"The first impression of the royal wel
come which the returning California vol
unteers received was undoubtedly a pleas
urable one. and was but a forerunner of
the elaborate programme to follow, which
has earned for San Francisco an enviable
reputation for patriotic hospitality."

EMPLOYERS ARE
ASKED TO HELP
Members of the committee appointed to
secure employment tor the returned sol
diers are making considerable headway
and are most encouraged by the outlook.
Yesterday Miss Malley and three assist
ants were busy sending out the following
circular to the employers throughout the
city and State: ,
The underpinned 'committee have been ap
pointed to secure employment for the members
of the First California Regiment and the
California Heavy Artillery now returning from
the Philippine*.
We address you as an employer, and ask you
If you cannot lend us some assistance. The
men who have foupht in the war must be
cared for in time of peace.
If you have any vacancy in your estab
lishment or can find employment for any man,
kindly address the secretary of the employ
ment committee, headquarters tent. Union
Square, inserting the character of employment
and the "waÃes attached. Very sincerely, A.
M. Lawrence (chairman), Rev. Dr. Voorsan
ger, A. H. Vail. Captain C. Nelson. Arthur
Kodgera, Robert J. Moore. A/thur L. Whitney,
Bruce Bonny, Llppmann Sachs, Otto L Wise,
W. S. Hochstadter. Charles. \j. Field, W. S.
Davis, C. H. Benedict.
The committee calculates to visit the
camp of the Callfornians during the early
part of next week to complete the data
upon which they hope to secure for the
volunteers the positions they gave up
when they enlisted in the service of Uncle
Sam.
CAVALRY MAY
ASSIST POLICE
If Chief Lees will accept of assistance
In handling the crowd which will unques
tionably line Market street this evening
the executive committee will request Ma
jor General Shatter to order out several
companies of the regulars to do police
duty. Cavalry companies will be pre
ferred. It Is believed that they can do
more effective work toward managing the
crowd than the police, and besides the lat
ter admit that they will be unable to cope
with the throngs. General Shafter has
expressed a willingness to comply with
the request if the Chief will accept of his
services.
THE STARTER OF
THE RECEPTION
All great undertakings have a begin
ning, and the one which for weeks has
occupied the attention of this city and
State â the proper reception of the re
turned California Regimentâ had its be
ginning: In the Mission district. On the
night of the 27th of last February, at a
meeting of Mission Parlor No. 38 of the
Native Sons of the Golden West, Frank
THEATERS
OPEN LATE
TO-NIGHT
ON account of the big parade
to-night the managers of the
Columbia, Orpheum, Tivoli,
Alcazar and California thea
ters have decided to hold their cur
tains until 9 o'clock, thus allowing
their patrons to view the great
demonstration without missing any
of the performance.
The Grand Opera-house and
Chutes will not open at all, but
. the Grand will give a special mati
nee on Sunday in lieu of the evei*
ing opera.
IT Mills, past president of that parlor
offered a suggestion that something ought
to be done by the Native Sons to receive
the First California Volunteers upon their
return to this city, whenever that might
be in a manner worthy of that order, tc
show that the regiment that had in Its
ranks so ninny natives of the State hat
the hearty appreciation of those who re
mained behind and gloried in their
achievements On his motion the parloi
annolnted n committee to take preliminary
action in the matter, and it was also de
cided to invite all the local parlors to ap
pnint a like rnmmittoe to consider th*
proposition. From that nvrtinp sprang
Mi. greal project which culminated in all
the citizens of San FraHcisco and many
of the localities outside of thecity j unit-
Ing in the grandest event in th.> lin* of
receptions in the history of San Francisco,
[n recognition of the faci that Mr. Mills

In his anxiety to avoid any possible
1 hitch in the arrangements for the big
parade which is to take place in honor of

Mr 1j C I'istolesi, Grand Marshal Joint Re

Dear sir We are somewhat surprised to learn
from your favor of yesterday that the gentle
men who have kindly volunteered to attend to
the expenditure of the funds raised by the citi
zens of San Francisco for the reception of the
returning California troops are willing to ac
cept so small a contribution from the Mar
ket-street Railway Company as that made by
â¡lacing three special cars at their service for
the transportation of the officers and crew of
the r S s lowa. We shall, however, take
Pleasure in furnishing three -pedal cars tor the
free transportation of said Officers and crew
from the foot of Sacramento street to the cor
ner of Jackson and Octavia streets, same to
leave precisely at 7:15 p. m.. the hour named in
' Permit toe to call attention to the fact that
the cars cannot be. detained at that point With'
out stopping other cars upon the line and
thereby detaining and Inconveniencing our citi
zens who desire to travel therein. I would,
therefore respectfully request that arrange
ments be mnde which will Insure that the
cars start promptly at the designated minute,
or If it is found thatUhe time stated is either
too early or too late, I would request that you
kindly give me notice not later than 11 o'clock
to-morrow morning as to the exact minute
that would be convenient. Yours sincerely.
E. P. VININO, General Manager.
As soon as the committee had partially
recovered from the shock this unlooked
for reply to what was considered a simple
request of convenience had given them
this reply was dictated to the street rail
way manager, which it is hoped will dis
abuse his mind of the idea that charity is
either asked or expected:

SESSION OF THE
PEACE SOCIETY
Three Thousand Peo
ple Attend.
STRONG SPEECHES MADE
SEVERE DENUNCIATION OF
THEODORE ROOSEVELT.
In His Address the Presiding Officer
Spares Neither President Me-
Kinley Nor Admiral
Dewey.
Special Dispatch to The fall.
MYSTIC. Conn., Aug. 25.-Fully 3000 peo
ple attended the annual meeting of the
Universal Peace Union and the Connec
ticut Peace Society in the peace temple
here to-day. At the morning session Pres
ident Love delivered a brief address on
the Philippine situation. Other addresses
were made by J. H. Earl of Boston, Mrs.
Comegys of Philadelphia and Mrs. Han
nah White of Lebanon. At this after
noon's session the prlcipal address was by
William Lloyd Garrison of Philadelphia,
who took for his theme "No Compromise
With War." Mr. Garrison spoke in part
as follows:
A year ago when, in the interest of peace, we
met upon this spot the war with Spain was In
full blast. Then In the national eye a Spaniard
was the type Of treachery and oppression, and
the Borrows of the suffering Cubans filled our
hearts.
What space twelve months covers. The Span
lard Is no longer a monster, but respected as
a brave and gallant foe. The Cubans, then
patriots and statesmen, now, In the opinion of
military experts and politicians, are people In
capable of governing themselves. A war with
the device Of freedom and chivalry on Its ban
ner has developed into a conflict for conquest
and baseness.
At The Hague the conclave of the great pow
ers was each eagerly engaged- In plundering
schemes of its own.
Is It strange that the International congress
failed? It Is not the armed savagery of the
Philippines that threatens America, but the
savagery that Theodore Roosevelt represents.
Had President McKlnley, understanding the
needleÃsness and iniquity of the war forced
upon Spain, vetoed the declaration of Congress
â¢and avowed his purpose of resigning his high
office rather than to prostitute It by subservi
ence to wrong, he would have made a niche in
the world's pantheon. Had John D. Long, a
man .of finer quality than the President and In
touch w'.th the nobler sentiments which make
his commonwealth exceptional, paraphrasing
the Indignant response of Charles Sumner in
fugitive slave days. "I was a man before I was
a (slave) commissioner," declared . Massachu
' setts manhood more precious than ; the Secre
taryship of the Navy, and surrendered his port
folio, he would have occupied a place In her
love and respect now forever lost.
Had Admiral Dewey. the one man who In
military life, who after distinguishing himself
in hl!> destructive profession, refrained from
self-laudatton hnd Admiral Dewey." in protest
of the Philippine betrayal, retired from the
qitarterde i ; to private citizenship, rather than
abet the outrage, the victory of Manila would
have pal.-d In comparison.
Politiral Independence, however. ha* not been
wanting, as is demonstrated by such party ad
herents as Hoar. B Jtwell and Edmundsâ
honor to them. Bui we look In vain for a sin
gle instance where an office has been sacrificed
to principle. Even the Secretary of state clings
to his position, forgetful of his vow, when an
uniram^k-d bard, he wrote:
â¢â¢For always in thine eyes, 0 Liberty,
Shine?. '.nat high, light whereby the world Is
saved,
And thouifh thou slay us, we will trust In
.â  thee."
Has Liberty lost' lts high light, or has John
Hay lost hit, vision?

COPPER BELT IN
YUKON DISTRICT
Ore Is Plentiful and
Very Rich.
Special Dispatch : .â¢ The Call.
TACOMA, Aug. 25.â Bennett City ad
vices state thai an immense copper l^'H
is known to extend from White Horse
Rapids on the Yukon River to a point
on the Dalton trail forty miles from
the Lynn Canal. Jt is all in British
territory.
Captain Jarvis of the Northwest
mounted police left Bennett last week
for the end of the belt on Dalton trail,
known as the Copper Blowout District.
He was in the district several Weeks
ago, and is returning with Â» large
party. He says the quartz taken out
assays 38 to 53 per cent copper, and
there is apparently an unlimited de
posit. Hundreds of claims have been
staked.
The district is just beyond the Por
cupine placer fields and eight miles be
yond the international boundary. It is
reached by trail from HaineS Mission.
and it is said an easy water grade is
available for taking the product to
tMe water. The White Horse copper
leads are thought to be extensions of
those on Dalton trail. The best of the
find is four miles from the Yukon.
Four thousand acres are staked, and
one company of twenty-two men has
3600 acres. They have filed water rights
at the perennial rapids at Miles Canyon
with the view of working the mines by
electricity. It is estimated that in one
place there are 150,000 tons of .copper
quartz in sight that is worth $60 per
ton. Matiy strikes of silver and gold
bearing quartz are being made in the
Upper Yukon district, but development
is not far enough along to prove the
value of the properties.
ADMIRAL WATSON
IS SERIOUSLY ILL
Suffering From Heart Disease on His
Ship and No One Permitted
to See Him.
WASHINGTON. Auff. 25.-The Army
and Navy Register, in its issue to
morrow, will say:
Recent letters from Manila mention
the p illness of Admiral Watson as the
source of great anxiety to his officers.
The illness is the effect of an accident
which occurred to his launch while he
was on board on July 11. The Balti
more, his flagship, has been for some
time at Cavlte, leaving Manila so as
to escape the full force of the typhoons.
Requiring to make a trip up the river,
the admiral started in his launch. A
strong wind was blowing and as the
launch, the Undine, went under the
bridge over the river, known as the
Bridge of Spain, the strong current,
aided by the wind, set against the lit
tle boat and she was taken out at hi c
course and thrown against a bawser
from a sailing vessel.
This rope carried away the awning,
and, striking the smokestack, took that
also. Admiral Watson, sitting in the
forward part of the launch and wit
nessing the full danger of the accident,
showed no conscious appearance of
having been startled excessively by the
occurrence or in any Avay of having
suffered by it. Later, however, in Tact
before hia return to the flagship, seri
ous heart trouble developed, and in
consequence he was regarded as ex
tremely ill up to the date of the letters
of the 17th. No one but his physician
is allowed access to him and all busi
ness of the fleet Is forbidden. It is
hoped, however, that the enforced quiet
tnay restore him to his previous health.
LOCATE SMOKELESS
POWDER DISCHARGE
Experiments Conducted by the Amer
ican Association for the Promo
tion of Science.
COLUMBUS, Ohio.. Aug. 25.â The next
meeting of the American Association for
the Advancement of Science will be held
at New York June 25 to 30, 1900.
The officers will bo: President and treas â 
urer. Professor Robert Simpson Wood
ward, dean of the School of Applied Sci
ences of Columbia University. New York;
permanent secretary, Iceland O. Howard
of Washington, Government entomologist;
general secretary, Charles Baskerville of
Chapel Hill, N. C; secretary of the coun
cil, William. F. Hallock of New York.
The genera] committee adopted a resolu
tion favoring Denver as the place of meet
ing in IDOO. This, however, does not bind
the association until acted on next year.
Professor K. A. Fessenden to-day read
a paper on the location of smokeless pow
der discharge by means of colored glass.
The powders selected for experiment were
the United States regulation powder and
the Union Metallic Cartridge Company s
smokeless powder cartridge. In .these the
red light predominates. The glass used
was gold ruby, which transmits red light
and cuts off the other colors. The dis
charge was thus rendered distinctly visi
ble as a red light. Vice President Elihu
Thompson, in discussing this method, sug
gested that the enemy might render ob
servations nugatory by burning red fire
at other points.
Professor E. H. Barbour of Nebraska
reported the rapid decline of geyser activ
ity in the Yellowstone region, giving de
tailed comparison of results in his two
visits on August 5. 1895, and the same date
In 1899. There is a decline in all the vol
canic phenomena about the park.

The expert electricians of The Call

to make the following statement:
The San Francisco Call, in order to test
the practicability of wireless telegraphy,
began experiments about seven weeks ago
by Installing a transmitting apparatus.

and ask neither aid nor sympathy. They

above which n vertical conductor of
seven-nlneteen standard cable ninety feet
long- was suspended from a sprit on top of
the flagpole. A receiving station was first
established four miles distant along the
beach, but with imperfect success. An
intermediate receiving station was then
installed at a distance of one mile, at
which signals were received although
shattered.
This latter effect was ascribed to the
proximity of a trolley wire, the occasional
spark from which during the passing of
a car affected the receiving apparatus.
The Tesla oscillator used for sending be

of short length, it was decided to install
a Ruhmkorff coilot twelve-inch spark. The
receiving station was then changed to a
distance of 2Â°oo feet and located in the

signals the instruments were adjusted un
til absolute accuracy was attained in the
transmission i-f messages at this distance.
The vertical wire of the sending station
was at Its lowest point fully lew feet above
the receiving station. The apparatus was
perfected to such an extent that the
aerial wire at the receiving station was
entirely dispensed with, and continued a<-
curacy and results were attained.
The receiving Instrument was th>n
placed on the yacht Lurline and connected
with a wire suspended from the masthead,
about seventy feet. A start was made
from a point "a half-mile off shore, the to
tal distance from sending station being
about one mile. Messages were received,
and by gradually increasing the distance
off shore until eight miles were reached
the zone within which perfect messages
were obtained was passed, and only Big
r.Rls received, Morse characters losing
their Intelligibility.
It was then decided to place the trans
mitting instruments on Lightship No 70,
anchored on San Francisco bar. about
nine miles from the receiving station,
which latter was then established at the
cliff House. The coil was operated from
the dynamos on the lightship, the form
of energy being the same as hitherto
used and adjusted for an eight-inch spar*.
Verticle wire on lightship eighty feet, at
Cliff House ninety -five feet. A conical
( apacity was used at both places and
beneficial. Between these stations
messages were received, which, although
somewhat indistinct, were nevertheless in
telligible, the crude apparatus not being
quite susceptive to the tine adjustment
required for this distance. Improvements
in the instruments now being made justi
fy the belief What perfect Buccess will be
attained at a much greater distance. Dur
ing these experiments for The San Fran
cisco Call it has been demonstrated that
much erroneous matter has been pub
lished on this subject and it has only been
by a stop by step process that success
has been reac.ed. It is proposed to con
tfnue the same line of investigation until
thf various apparatuses used are br
down to the smallest possible e"omp;u;s
and highest degree of perfection.
marked oft at intervals by three water
falls eight or ten feet In height. The
loaded boat was helplessly trapped in the
swirl of waters, and knowing that to at
tempt to make land would only increase
the probabilities of disaster the three men
â  -i their energies t" keeping their
craft in the center <>f the stream.
The tirst cataract was negotiated with
comparative safety, a little water being
shipper! in making the leap. At th*> next
fall the boal almost filled with water, and
as the next leap was made she capsized
with the weight of water in her. The men
swam for th^lr liven, but the treacherous
undertow draped them down so persist
ently that they were not able to make
iand until they had been carried over a
quarter of a mile. The upturned boat was
rescued, and it seemed, providentially, a
sack ( f flour hyd caught by a nail and
held under a thwart of the boat, and this
alone saved them from starvation.
All their outfits were lost, but the dar
ing fellows counted themselves lucky
that the boat did not capsize at the first
cataract, in which case they would un
doubtedly have been lost. They lived for
two months on the bag of flour, doling it
out sparingly, and on reaching Teslln one
of them secured a boat and proceeded
alone toward Dawson, while Levy and the
ihird made for home.
ARTISANS OF THE SHERMAN AS SEEN BY CHARLES C. COONLEY.
Mr. Coonley, a daring member of the regiment, prepared the above sketches on the transport. On arriving here
he awaited his opportunity, rushed the guards and tossed thtÂ» roll aboard The Call tug. It struck on the boat's rail
and bounded overboard.- It was a small matter to haul the little roll aboard, however, and it is now published, even
though the guards were attending strictly to duty.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, AUGUST 26. 1899.
ACTION OF OTIS
ANGERS CHINESE
Peking Government to
Protest.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Aup:. 25.â A Press spe
cial from Washington says: Whether
General Otis' order excluding the CHi
nppo from entering the Philippines
ought to be revoked is a question that
is rer'oivinp serious consideration.
War Department officials do not in
tend to make any recommendation until
< >t in has been heaid from. He is pre
sumably competent to decide, but the
matter would seem to threaten compli
cations. It is estimated that there are
about f>2,000 Chinese in the Philippines.
Since American occupation (Jhinese im
migration to the islands has been on the
increase. Doubtless it was this con
; stant influx which caused Otis to pro
| inulgate the order.
The resentment of- the Chinese Gov-
I ernment probably will be provoked. The
, Chinese Minister, in a diplomatic way,
1 has notified the State Department that.
i if the Chinese are to be excluded from
j the Philippines the United States may
expect a protest from China. He says
i his Government could not preserve Its
! self-re^pt-ct if it were to allow the Uni
ted States to prohibit the immigration
â  â¢1" Chinese citizens to possessions of the
United Suites lying as close to China
as the Philippines. While the Minister
did not indicate what China would do,
i there is no doubt that retaliation is
! contemplated in a restriction of trade
! conditions.
A number of letters have been re
ceived at the War Department from
English and German merchants in the
Philippines who employ Chinese labor,
requesting that nothing be done by the
\ United States which will be inimical
! to this class of labor, as it is the most
', reliable to be had in the islands.
Should the United States see fit to up
hold the order issued by Otis, it is not
unlikely that the English and Germans
would do all in their power to pro
] yoke the Chinese Government to re
taliatory measures.
The Chinese Government has shown

Philippines is different from the China
man known in this country. Thousands
of them in the Philippines are engaged
as peddlers and a large number are
merchants. Some of the official reports,
including those of Admiral Dewey.
have paid high tribute to the work per
formed by the Chinese.
Naval Constructor Hobsrfn has re
ported recently on the value of Chinese
labor in the reconstruction of the
sunken Spanish warships. While Chi
nese labor is highly thought of by the
Americans, the English and Germans in
the Philippines the qualities which have
won for it good opinions from these
sources have provoked the enmity of
the native Filipinos. Being shiftless
and unreliable the Filipinos have found
themselves supplanted to a large extent
in the insular industries.
On the other hand. Mr. Williams, for
mer Consul at Manila, who still remains
there in a confidential capacity, has
written to the State Department that
the exclusion of the Chinese from the
islands would aid materially in bring
ing the war to a close. It may be that
General Otis issued his order for the
exclusion of the Chinese because he
hqlds views similar to those of Mr.
Williams.
HUNTER ATTACKED
BY WOUNDED DEER
Nearly Killed by Ani-
mal's Hoofs.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL. Aug. 25.â John Enos, a
contractor at present engaged in cutting
timber on the headwaters of the Laguni
tas, came near losing his life yesterday
in an encounter with a wounded deer. Two
faithful hounds saved him from death,
but his condition is still serious. Enos
left his camp early in the morning for a
hunt in Carson Canyon, taking with him
two dogs. In the early part of the after
noon the dogs jumped a large buck, which,
in fleeing from them, made directly for the
stand upon which Enos was waiting. Aa
the animal approached he lired two shots.
The first was without effect, but the sec
ond struck the animal in the side, slightly
wounding him. The shot stopped him
for a moment, and then seeing Enos but
a short distance away the infuriated
beast made a dash for him.
Rearing upon his hind legs the deer
pawed the unfortunate hunter, forcing
him to the ground. At this moment Enos'
dogs came up and attacked the buck on
the hind Quarters, thus drawing him away
from their prostrate master. While the
dogs were worrying the deer Enos strug
gled to his feet, and drawing a large
hunting Knife stabbed the animal in the
neck. Jn spite of this the deer continued
to fight the dogs until at last the loss of
blood forced him to the ground, where the
dogs soon dispatched him.
Knos managed to reach the woodchop
pers" camp an hour later in an exhausted
condition. He was taken to his cabin and
put to bed. where he has remained, being
unable to get up. The sharp hoofs of the
deor lacerated his flesh and completely
tore the clothing from the upper part of
his body. It will be several weeks beforÂ»
he will be able to move around.
Enos has led a life full of adventure.
He claims to have faced armed men jof all
nationalities in his day, but never remem
bers to have had so narrow an escape
from death before. He describes the at
tack of the infuriated beast with a shud
der, and says he will carry a vivid re
membrance of the experience to the grave.

snn of Dr. W. J. Sehildge of 254
/r = -\ 'â  Warren street, / Brooklyn, New
O â  \>' York, suddenly disappeared with
out leaving a trace of his -where
abouts behind him. His parents searched
for him diligently, but all efforts were in
vain. One day, however, they received
word from friends residing In Philadel
phia, who had heard of the boy's disap
pearance, that a young chap enlisted in
the army under the name of Herman L..
Smith, whose extreme youth had been
commented upon by the press. This, to
gether with the fact that the Christian
name corresponded with that of Schildge,
convinced the parents that their son en
listed with the Pennsylvania volunteers.
When they heard that the Pennsylva
nians were due here, they wrote to friends
residing in the city, and who knew the
boy. A few days ago the boy was dis
covered in this city.
He said he had changed his name and
gave a wrong age when he enlisted, so
that his friends could not follow him. He
joined the army for the purpose of win
ning glory in the service of his country
and returning crowned with the laurels
of the hero. Upon inquiry, he admitted
that his anticipations were sadly crushed,
and that all he brought with him was a
lot of experience and an empty stomach.
It is expected that he will receive a warm
welcome when arriving home.
He is a fine young fellow, looking more
like 18 than 16 years, and were it
not for the disappointment that is revealed in his features one might find
a strong determination pictured in his face. He has left for the East, where his
arrival Is expected with impatience.

A SALT LAKE OPINION.
Till: Deseret Evening News, which announces;
that it is "The Organ of the Church of Jesus
Christ of Latfer-day Saint?, Lorenzo Snow,
Trustee-in-trust," attacks The Call for the serious of
fenses of "criminality and folly." We come -with all
humility to plead to the charge, in the presence of an
"organ" of such stupendous claims.
( >ur â¢ ffense consists in a recent article in which we
stated tlu- inconsistency of policy within the jurisdic
of th I nited States, which make- polygamy, a
crime in Utali and gives it official recognition and pays
i â¢ exponent a salary in the Sulus.
News, which i- run by revelation* reminds us
â  - of the United States is not the)
tci â¢ the mind of the Lord," and that the j
authority of the Mormon church for polygamy is not
found in the Book of Mormon but in the Bible. For
an inspired nr^an the New- makes the odd mistake
ting that we conceive polygamy to be pro
hibited by the Declaration of Independence. For an !
int< the mind of the Lord Lorenzo Snow.
shows a heat incompatible with his wintry name.
Leaving out the tcuje of badinage in which we
ciothed the pn -entation of what we conceive to be
an inexcusable inconsistency of policy in our Govern
ment, let v- restate our position.
The object of the organization of the Republican
party was to establish, maintain and enforce abso- :
lute equality before the law of all men within the-,
jurisdiction of the constitution of the United States.
This statement of its principles and purpose was an
ni7ed by the slave-holders. That issue was joined
ami upon it they offered battle. The challenge wa.s
â¢ pted, and the sanguinary contest raiged for four !
year-. On many of its battle-fields more men were
killed than the whole number enlisted in our present
military adventure. The result establi-hed the Re- I
publican contention for universal equality before the
law. . ,
We insist upon that equality now. We regard gov
ernment by consent of the governed and equality of
rights to be the essential germ and the vital prin
ciple of this republic. So believing, we insist that if
tins Government authorize and protect polygamy in
the Sulus because it is taught by the Mahometan
religion, it must authorize and protect polygamy in
Utah and wherever there is a Stake of Zion, because
it is taught by the Mormon religion. Mahometan
ism accepts the Bible in both Testaments, and puts
[ssa ben Miriam in its Catalogue of ineffable person- !
alities. Mormoni?m does the same, and presents the
Book of Mormon, like the Koran, as a later revela- i
tion. Equality before the law requires that the be
lievers in either shr:ll be treated alike. It is useless
for the trustee-in-trust of the Mormon organ to mis
represent our position oT to evade the issue which, it.
raises. We cited the case of Mr. Angus Cannon,
member of the Fir>t Presidency -of the Mormon
church, who is awaiting sentence for polygamy, and
contrasted the dolors of his position with the pleas
ant places in which are cast the lines of the- Sulu
Sultan. Mr. Snow say.- that Mr. Cannon has not been
married at al! in the last year or two, and that he
was not accused of polygamy or plural marriage when
arrested. Grant that, lie was, in the verbiage of the
law. accused of "unlawful cohabitation," and his
nse consisted in resuming conjugal relations with
a number of wives to whom lie had been married be
;â¢ re. There is no difference in the offence in the eye
of the law. The corpus delicti is the maintenance of
the polygamous relation as taught by the Mormon
religion; whether derived from the Bible or the Book
. Mormon makes no difference.
The Government of the United States took high
ground under the impetus of the moral sense of the
pic when it entered upon the extirpation of poly
gamy in Utah. It is no answer to that position for
Mr. Snow to say that there are seraglios in San Fran-
O. There are. and their existence is deplored by
morality as a wicked vice, and is frowned upon by the
law. It has not the excuse of being the exercise of a
practice enjoined by religion and is not countenanced
by statutory recognition. Mr. Snow stands for the
contention that a Gentile vice is transmuted into a
Mormon virtue by a. canon of the church. We merely
demand that if this position is recognized by our
vemment in the Sulus, the principle of equality
d< mands that it have equal recognition in Utah.
Finally, Mr. Snow is careful not to deny that poly_
gamy is again practiced in Utah. We make the
charge that plural marriages are by no means sin
gular in that State. Will he deny it?
THE IDEAL FETE CLIMATE.
SAN FRANCISCO has had great parades and
pageants before, but none has half equaled the
.variety and sumptuous spectacular quality oi
i this fete in honor of our returned soldiers.
Its ornate and majestic features have presented
everything that can please the eye. stimulate the
j imagination and make the heart beat faster.
On no other American water has appeared the equal
| in beauty, of the marine procession which escorted the
i Sherman to her anchorage. Squadrons of battleships
have steamed in line on New York Bay, and the
spectators have from either side viewed the scene
! from the decks of all kinds of craft, but no procession
I has moved upon the water that had the impressive
beauty of decoration, precision of formation and im
pressive dignity that charmed every sense, as this
! escort of banner-flying boats steamed from the Heads
j down to the Golden Gate and into the center of the
harbor. The processions in the city, marching be
tween lofty pine and palm, and past walls of the na
j tional colors, arranged in the most tasteful of pa
triotic devices, gave to and took from the scene a
grace inexpressible.
The night scene on the water and in the streets.
: illuminated by myriads of electric lights, has been
more than grand. It has inspired a feeling of awe in
man, standing in the presence of the works wrought
by his own genius.
And it has all been seen through day and night, on
j land and water, in perfect comfort by the hundreds
]of thousands. The spectators have had neither to
â  swelter in the heat nor shiver in the cold. They have
, passed readily and comfortably from the scene of one
spectacle to another. The facilities of the city have
been so ample that none have gone hungry for lack
of a place to feed, nor tired for need of a place to
rest.
No storms have disturbed the crowds and no gales
have tugged at. the splendid decorations. The wide
streets and avenues have rendered a jam and panic
impossible, and good order, good temper and un
bounded patriotic enjoyment have marked the great
function from the beginning.
To our people it has been a needed revelation.
San Francisco is the metropolis of the friendliest cli
mate in the world. In no other great American city
j could there have been such absolute guarantee of
clemency in the elements, such assurance of immun
ity from storm and tempest, such absolute equability
of climate, as to make all these pleasures sure. In
no capital of the Old World, not even in gay Paris
| or Vienna or Rome, can be found such certainty o\
[ the adaptation of weather to such a purpose.
In a high sense these facts and the line of thought
they promote are of the greatest material importance
to San Francisco. They not only teach our people to
make more frequent use in this way of their climatic
advantages, but they impress all with the need of
making permanently the best use of those advan
tages. They lead to a call for the best streets, for the
more general joining of the beauties with the utilities
of architecture. Washington City has in Pennsyl
vania avenue one of the noblest thoroughfares in the
world, but it is ensmalled by the meanness of the
architecture of the buildings which line it. Its
straight stretch has at one end the mighty Capitol
and at the other the classical building of the Treasury.
But between, with few exceptions, are only the cheap
est and meanest of buildings. Sordid fronts, windows
â  stinted in proportion, roofs of melancholy pitch, chill
the spirit that has been raised by the splendors of the
Capitol, the gorgeous art of the Congressional Li
brary an<l the classic front of the Treasury. San
Francisco has in Market street her grand thorough
fare. It already far excels Pennsylvania avenue in
the excellence of its architecture. Every year the
: blunt -laced structures, snub-nosed and lantern
jawed, to meet the economy or the haste of the
pioneer builders, pass away and are replaced by mod
ern buildings, in which the architect's sense of ex
terior beauty is given some scope and play.
As the rebuilding of this street goes on let every
property-owner remember the pageantry that is now
j passing. Let him recall the perfect tone of the sky,
> the softness and hire of the weather, the bright
kaleidoscopic effect of the "welr-dressed hundreds of
thousands, the charm of the decorations,-and remem
ber how art can. come to the aid of nature in pro
ducing these effects, which are worth crossing the
continent to see, and when he builds see to it that he
adds to the attractions of this great street, which is
; the first traveled by the thousands who come here to
! this part of the highway around the world.
Another steamer has come down from Alaska with
a crowd of lucky gold-hunters, but their number,
though considerable, is small in comparison with
that of the crowds that went with them when they
started on the search. The few who strike it rich
come home in the cabin and get their names in the
prpers. but the others either stay in the snow or
come home in the steerage and say nothing.
BRYAN'S FAD.
BOSS' BRYAN has just addressed three State
conventions in Nebraska, the NÂ«w Democracy,
the Silver Republicans and the Populists, and
has dictated their platforms and their fusion nomina
tions. His language in the Democratic platform is:
"Our confidence in the principles set forth in the
Chicago platform has been increased as those prin
ciples have been vindicated by event?. The gold
standard is less defensible now than it was in 1896.
The ratio of 16 to 1 is the natural and necessary
ratio."
In his speeches to the three parties to the fusion
Colonel Bryan put free silver at 16 to iÂ»foremost, and
his orders were implicitly obeyed. ' At the same time
that he was forcing this declaration one of his lead
ing supporters in California. Professor Ross, was de
claring that the silver issue has passed, and that "the
demand of 16 to 1 has ceased to be admissible."
Asked why it is no longer admissible, the professor
s;;id: "For three reasons. In the first place the an
nual output of gpld has since 1806 shot up from $200,
--000,000 to ,$300,000,000. It relieves the monetary
famine and has tended. to< reduce if not entirely wipe
oat the annual appreciation of gold. In the second
place, three or more years of debts have been con
tracted under the gold standard and a corresponding
j mass of old debt incurred under the bimetallic stan
dard has been wiped out. In the third place, there
was a likelihood in 180/ i that certain other nations
I would follow a bold step on the part of the United
States, and thus independent action on our part might
I bring about international bimetallism. We have no
longer any ground for such hope. For these three
reasons a proposal which was reasonable in 1806 be
comes extreme in 1890."
The professor has reduced his abandonment of the
issue to an approximately scientific form. The value
1 thereof is the admission that free coinage of silver at
16 to 1 was an expedient and not a scientific principle.
! The increase in the gold output since 1805, when it
was $200,406,000. has been at the rate of $25,000,000 a
iyear in. order, to .reach the volume for this year as
stated by the professor. But it was increasing in two
THE SAN FRANCISCO CAL.L, SATURDAY, ATJGUST 26, 1899.
years prior to 1895 at the rate of $21,455,600 per year.
.It is somewhat difficult to find any excuse existing
now m tlie increase of the annual gold product for
abandoning 16 to 1 that did not also exist in the same
cause in 1806.
The production of gold fell in 1873 to $96,000,000,
and, according to the professor's theory, being scarce,
it should have been much higher than silver, while
as a fact gold and silver were then closer together
than they have been since. As the product of gold
has risen, the distance between it and silver has in
creased instead of diminishing. If the market price
of the two metals is to be taken as the measure of
their annual appreciation or depreciation, gold is
higher now than when the Bland act passed, for silver
is lower. The great fact is that the Bryan fad had no
scientific foundation, and therefore every prediction
based upon it has failed.
But while the professor is declaring that the issue
has passed, that it is no longer reasonable and' must
be abandoned, the Colonel is proclaiming that it is
more necessary now than in 1896! The professor was
desirous of stability in the standard of value and hails
its coming in the small increase in the average out
put of gold over that increase prior to 1806. But the
Colonel is embarrassed by the multiplication of rea
sons for adhering to '"the natural and necessary ratio
of 16 to 1."
Whether the reasons given will bear investigation
or not, there is no doubt that Professor Ross repre
sents the whole body of supporters of Bryan in 1896
who were at any time in danger of permitting them
selves to think about the silver issue. The spell of
that year and the spell-binding done by Bryan and
Coin Harvey, helped out by hard times, swept many
a man off his feet who has recovered his reason and
is now wondering that he' ever was tripped by such
an airy thread.
The strength of Mr. Bryan was among the discon
tented. Their ranks are always recruited by a pan:c
and hard times. What Colonel Bryan needs now is
an untimely frost that will kill the crops in the Mis
sissippi Valley and a drought next spring that will
leave the seed to dry in the ground. If to this an in
vasion of the bubonic plague could be added, or any
epidemic pestilence, he might succeed in polling
nearly as many votes as before. Without these aids
to his ambition all reasonable men see the hopeless
ness of his fight. Pie will go as General Weaver did.
He was twice the Presidential candidate of the organ
ized discontent of the country and was in his day the
same oratorical wonder that Bryan is now. But the
common sense of the country saw that government
cannot be safely founded on failure and disease, and
turned to the success and health that survived and
built on them.
So it will be now. Colonel Bryan will run and will
be left on the backstretch, as he was before.
It is said that some of the French generals testify
in the Dreyfus case with the affrighted countenances
of men who had just awakened from a terrifying
nightmare. Perhaps it is the threat of a coming
reality rather than a dream which stamps fear in their
faces.
Only three square inches on a two-foot map of

RUSSIAN TACTICS IN FINLAND.
RUSSIAN statesmen are past masters of the art
of holding conquered peoples in subjection by
exciting among them all forms of antagonism
that craft can manage to foment, whether of race,
or creed, or class. They arc now applying such tac
tics in Finland. Recent n ports from the province
announce that the suppression of the ancient constitu
tion, which guaranteed the self-government of the
Finns, has been followed by the appearance of Rus
sian emissaries among the peasants seeking to stir up
an agrarian agitation among the landless against the
land-owners.
According to a recent issue of Finland, a journal
devoted to the cause of the Finnish people, the
peasants have been told that under the Russian Gov
ernment their holdings will he considerably increased
at the expense of the present proprietors. It is be
lieved, however, the Finnish peasants will not be de
ceived by the promise to any great extent, as most of
them are fairly well educated and are familiar with
what befell the peasants of the Baltjc provinces who
believed similar tales from Russian officials when their
liberties were at stake, and who are now repenting
their folly.
It appears, moreover, that in Finland there is not
a sufficiently large number of landholdings to
excite the cupidity of the landless or to give
ri=e to a , widespread antagonism among the
people. According to the latest official reports
there were in Finland 117,704 cultivated farms,
and of these only 2694 contained more than
100 hectares, or 247 acres, the great bulk consisting of
small farms ranging from 20 to 100 acres. Out of the
total .36.559,000 hectares contained in the province the
nobility own but 364,437, or less than I per cent.
On such a showing it appears unlikely there, will
be any predisposition on the part of the peasants of
Finland to the antagonisms the Russian statesmen
are trying to engender.^lt is noted, furthermore, that
the Finns are pretty well aware that about 25,000.000
peasants are now on the verge of starvation because
of heavy taxation and military burdens laid upon
them. They will therefore have no great desire for
a reorganization of Finland on the Russian system..
The Finnish patriots in the meantime well under
stand the danger of such agitations as the Russians
are trying to start, and are doing all in their power to
prevent them. Large land-owners are co-operating
to assist the non-proprietary peasants to acquire land,
it being strongly felt that making every Finlander a
full proprietor in the soil will be the surest way of
keeping the whole people stable and united in the
struggle for the preservation of its ancient liberties
and rights.

BRONZE BADGER FOR THE WISCONSIN.
The bronze badger, emblem of the State, and which is to be mounted on the
battleship Wisconsin, was cast in Chicago last week. The casting was witnessed
by a delegation of Milwaukee citizens. The badger, which is in a crouching atti
tude, will surmount the bronze shield containing the coat-of-arms of Wisconsin.
The entire weight of the casting will 1 be 1200 pounds. It is made from captured
Spanish cannon after a design by Paul Kupper. The figure and shield will be
mounted either on the prow or forward turret of the Wisconsin.
A BOORISH GOVERNOR
AL.IFORNIA has ample cause to feel thoroughly ashamed of her
> present Governor. It would seem as though he is lacking in about
I every essential that belongs to the gentleman. He Is coarse, rude
\^4 and uncivil and rides heedlessly over the feelings of the general run
of people Who come in business contact with him. He is allied with
about all that is corrupt in politics and that is abominable in his advisers.
The people might bear in silence the shortcomings of boorishness and in
patience bide the next election, but his present ungraceful posture is cer
tainly putting the State itself in an undesirable light with distinguished
visiting strangers. At the time of the launching of the Wisconsin, the
press had no criticism to make of the chief executive who appeared at the
Wisconsin banquet in a rough work coat and otherwise exhibited his police
court manners to the distinguished men of that State, then visiting San
Francisco. That episode was passed in silence. But within the past few
months three Governors and two committees from several States have
journeyed westward to greet on American soil their home-coming volun
teers. A Hottentot ruler would have extended some kind of a welcome to
such distinguished visitors. Certainly from a State noted for its hospitality
something was due in the way of acknowledging their presence. The Gov
ernor of Oregon, the Governor of Nebraska and the Governor of Colorado
will return home, however, without knowing that California has a chief ex
ecutive, or, knowing, it will understand that he is lacking in the first
essentials of politeness. On similar missions came delegations of promi
nent men from Pennsylvania. They came as representatives of their State
and were entitled to some official greeting, but they were ignored entirely
so far as the chief executive was concerned. Common decency, the com
monest kind of common courtesy, demanded that the Governor of Cali
fornia, in the name of the State, should extend some kind of a welcome to
these gentleman. At the disposal of the Governor there is a p'ubllc fund for
just such emergencies. There are State tugboats that could, without detri
ment to the public service, have been given over to the entertainment of
those visitors. He could at lf-ast have met them and shaken hands with
them. What did Governor Gage do? Simply nothing. He went into hid
ing with political manipulators, sneaked away from his duty, and acted
like a boorish clown to the everlasting discredit of California.

Especially good are the quintet and chorus
of the third act and the prayer at the

good drop in the opera. The others are

SULU ISLAND MAY
CAUSE MORE TROUBLE
Germany and England Interested by-
Virtue of an Almost Forgotten
Treaty.
Special Cable to The Call and the Now York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1899, by James Goi~
don Bennett.
PARIS. Aug. 25.â dispatch published
in the Herald on August 14 giving an ac
count of the negotiations between General
Bates and the Sultan of Sulu may open
up a somewhat interesting point in Inter
national law.
The trade of England and Germany In
the Sulu archipelago Is regulated by a
convention drawn up between Spain, Eng
land and Germany. As this convention.
dating from the year 1 77. has somewhat
dropped out of sight, the Herald corre
spondent took advantage of the presence
in Paris of Spencer Pratt, former Consul
General of the United States at Singa
pore, to obtain his views on the question.
Mr. Pratt stated the situation in Sulu as
follows:
"Though after the Sulu war of 1876 the
Sultan formally admitted Spain to suzer
ainty over his dominions, this was more
apparent than real and limited to the â  --
tablishment of a Spanish garrison on the ;
islands of Sulu, Sassl and a few other
points of minor importance. Trouble with
'foreign powers began by Spain on the
strength of these garrisons, levying or
endeavoring to levy customs and other
duties on goods landed on other points,
and otherwise hampering trade with the
archipelago. This led to constant friction
and especially with England and Germany |
and in 1577 both these countries protested
with such vigor that on March 11 conven
tion was entered into which defined the
position of these powers in the archipel
ago.
"Spain abandoned the necessity it form-
â :â !>â  imposed on merchant ships bound for
Butu of calling at Bamboa to pay du
tirs and obtain permit of navigation and !
accorded complete freedom of navigation :
throughout the Sulu archipelago.
"In the ports occupied by Spain the Gov
ernment of the King reserved to itself the
risht of imposing duties and sanitary reg
ulations, but on the points effectively oc
cupied by Spain it undertook at the same
time to maintain the necessary establish
ment and functionaries for the necessaries
of commerce.
"Spain's supremacy has now come. to an
end, but the question remains whether in I
the terms of the article of the treaty of
Paris her obligations as suzerain power
have not devolved on the United States.
"The Sultanate of Sulu." Bald Mr. Pratt,
"comprises Sulu Island and some 140 other
islands. The population is estimated at
HO.fNiO Mohammedan by religion and more
or less pirates by instinct. The Sultan, a
man of fair intelligence, has at times had
difficulty in ruling his people.
"This was one of the most powerful rea
sons for dmitting Spanish suzerainty, as
tho presence there of garrisons contribu
ted â¢â â¢ maintain his power. It was for
this reason that, as far back as February
last special information having reached
me to the effect that the Spanish garri
son was about to evacuate Sulu and leave
the Sultan to contend alone against a :
peaceful coalition in order to prevent
civil war, I urged general Otis to at once
dispatch an American force to Sulu to
recognize the reigning Sultan under the
protection of the United States, with such
guarantees as existing conditions might
require, but with as little interference as i
possible with the established Mohamme
dan laws and customs, merely affording !
him means of holding his own against j
those who were or might be contesting i
with his authority. This I consider was |
the only safe and rational policy, and 1
hope that it is. the one our Government â¢
decided to adopt."

BATTLESHIP ALABAMA
READY FOR THE NAVY
New Fighting Craft to Go Out to Sea on Monday
on the Builders' Trial Trip.
PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 25.â From the yards of the Cramp Company the battleship Alabama, the most powerful
vessel of her class in the American navy, will go out to sea Monday on her builders 1 trial trip. Her behavior on this
voyage will be watched with great interest everywhere, for the Alabama represents the latest advance of American
skill in naval construction. Her two sister ships, the Wisconsin, at the Union Iron Works, and Illinois, at Newport
News, are in course of construction.
Her principal dimensions are: Length on load water-line, 36S feet; extreme breadth, 72 feet 5 inches; mean
draught. 23 feet 6 inches; displacement at this draught, 11,525 tons.
The motive power consists of two vertical inverted three-cylinder triple-expansion engines driving twin screws,
estimated to develop 10,000 indicated horse-power under moderate forced draught. The Alabama's armament consists
of four 13-inch breech-loading rilles, mounted in pairs in two elliptical turrets on the middle line, one forward and
one aft of the superstructure; fourteen 6-inch rapid-fire breech-loading rifles, mounted in sponsons on the casement
deck, and a secondary battery of sixteen six-pounders and four one-pounder rapid-fire guns, one Gatling gun and
one field gun.
There will be four torpedo tubes, and the total weight of metal which this namesake of the famous Confed
erate cruiser will be able to discharge in a broadside of her entire batteries will be 2962 pounds; or, if firing from
both sides, 5924 pounds.
The elliptical turrets, which are a novelty in the design of the Alabama, are calculated to afford a decrease in
weight and a better arrangement of interior space for those loading and ir.anning the guns. They also present a
narrower front to the guns of th-" 1 enemy.
According to experts the armor of the Alabama is the most complete ever put upon a battleship. It is of
Harveyized nickel steel. The side armor is 16% inches thick at the top of the belt, and tapers to 9^ inches at the
bottom. In the turrets the porthole plates are 17 inches thick, and other plates 15 inches. The protective deck rises
from the lower inside edge of the water-line belt upward and inside to a level with the top of the belt, and forms
an armored flat, the slope being 4 inches aft. 3 inches forward, and on the flat 2% inches thick.
Another novelty on the Alabama is the placing of her two smokestacks abreast of each other instead of along
the axis of the vessel. In pome respects the Alabama resembles the lowa, though the new battleship is eight feet
longer and several inches r>->.rrower than her predecessor.

Athabasca Landing, where the water
route was abandoned for the land trail by

they ran short of provisions, a horse was
killed and th< flesh eaten. Later In De

Certificates Were Issued.

CALL HEADQUARTERS. WEL
LINGTON HOTEL, WASHINGTON.
Aug. 25. â In addition to th<n question as
to his action in granting a certificate
of ownership to the alleged filibuster
ing steamer Abbey, Dr. Edward Bedloe.
Consul at Canton, will be required
upon his return to Washington to an
swer to charges preferred against him
by the Chinese Government. Just what
their character is officials decline to
say, but it is understood they relate in
some manner to the issuance of Ameri
can certificates to Chinese. Close offi
cial friends of Dr. Bedloe assert that*
he is the victim of a conspiracy.
The Abbey is held at present by Ad
miral Watson under orders from the
Secretary of the Navy, and her release
can only be effected after the Navy
Department has had all the facts pre
sented to it. If she is not released the
question may turn on the action of Dr.
Bedloe in granting her an American
registry without fully informing him
self of the character of the vessel.
Dr. P.edloe's attorneys said to-day
that the Abbey carried only one cargo
of arms and ammunition to the Phil
ippines. "The sale of these arms and
ammunition," he continued, "was made
in the office of the United States Con
sul Genera] at Hongkong, Mr. Wild
man. The Abbey was placed under the
American Hag in the United States
consulate at Canton. The statement
that Dr. Bedloe gave assistance to the
Filipinos is false and malicious. Be
sides, at the time he issued the certifi
cate the United States was not at war
with the Filipinos, but they were prac
tically allies."
It is understood that Consul General
Wildman is connected with the presen
tation of Dr. Bedloe's action regarding
the Abbey to the department.
The suspension of Dr. Bedloe was
only ordered after the department had
fully informed itself of the facts. Dr.
Bedloe was appointed Consul at Can
ton on October 4, 1897, from Philadel
phia, Notwothstanding his strong in
dorsements he experienced much diffi
rulty in getting his last appointment,
as his record for efficiency at Amoy
had not been of the best.

PROTEST AGAINST
DEWEY'S ACTION
WASHINGTON, Aug 25.â The Navy De
partment has received a protest from W.
F. Sylvester of London, one of the owners
<>f the ship Abbey, seized by Admiral
Dewey on the charge of carrying arms to
the Filipinos. He states that he is about
to come to Washington to contest this
seizure on the ground that the Filipinos
were the allies of the United States at the
time these arms were shipped. At the
same time the State Department, through
Consul General Goodnow at Shanghai,
has prosecuted an inquiry into the ship
ment of arms, and a report iÂ« now before
the department. Based on the report, the
State Department is preparing a letter to
the Navy Department which will be the
ground for further proceedings. The own
ers of the Abbey have retained counsel
here to look after their interests, and he
has filed a number of papers both at the
State and Navy departments, and called
to-day to submit documents in the case.
The ramiiications of the Abbey seizure
are engaging the attention of the State.
War and Navy departments and promise
to bave some interesting sequels. It is
Bald at the State Department that the ac
tion taken as to Consul BetUoe, our rep
resentative at Canton, was because he
certified that Mr. Sylvester was an Amer
ican citizen, and on this the Abbey se
cured a registry. A letter just received
here from Consul Bedloe states that he
is on leave of absence and is on his way
home via San Francisco.
eating:. Observing the general aston
ishment, silent though it was, she ex
plained that she always carried an an
tiseptic with her to sterilize everything
that had to do with her meals. "What
an excellent idea," said the hostess.
The story illustrates a phase of the an
tiseptic craze which is now possessing
Washington, another example of which
is the custom now almost universal
among the barber shops of the capital
of sterilizing everything used in the va
rious departments of the tonsorial pro
fession.

â  :. and

In the pavilion every Inch of the
more than three acres of floor space has
been taken by exhibitors, who under
stand that their booths must possess
artistic merit and that nothing com
monplace will be allowed. One exhib
itor alone is expending $1000 upon his
booth; another is expending $700, and
others are going to an expense vari
ously less than these amounts.
The city of Sacramento displays this
year a marked zeal toward making the
approaching event one long to be re
membered. The leading fraternal and
beneficiaJ organizations of the city have
selected a particular da- during the
two weeks of the fair, to be known as
their day, an a pronounced rivalry
has sprung up among them as to which
event shall be the biggest. The women
of Sacrament i will take part in the
opening exercises at the pavilion. No
lees than twenty-seven different asso
ciations, the membership of. some of
which numbers over 100, have signified
their Intention to be on hand. The
management promises the public that
every exhibit will be !n place at this
time, and the intention is practically to
turn the pavilion over to the women.
In the upper part of the north wing,
where the art gallery is situated, room
will be set apart for the use of com
mittees of women, and here light re
freshments will be served to visitors
without cost. On each succeeding night
there will be a musical and vaudeville
programme, which will change daily.
Entries in all departments show that
there will be an immense number and
variety of the very highest class of
California products exhibited in the
Pavilion. The variety of fowls which
will be exhibited in the poultry depart
ment has never been surpassed.
Among the most interesting features
in the Pavilion will be a silo and en?i
/ in operation under the
supervision of Professor Douglas T.
Fowler of the State University. This
model and, to California, modern meth
f preparing and preserving green
food for a winter ration for stock will
be explained In every detail. A com

Among the stock that will be shown
at the park there will be representa

Scecial Dispatch to The Call.
RENNES, Aug. 25.â After M. Ber
tillon, the handwriting expert,
who is at the head of the an
thropometrio department of the
prefecture of police at Paris, had
concluded the first installment of
his so-called demonstration of the guilt
of Captain Dreyfus a prominent Drey
'fusard referred to him as the fin-de
si^cle Cagliostro.
The Dreyfusards refuse to regard him
as anything: but the prince of quacks.
They cover his remarks with ridicule
and protest that the admission of his
fantastic theories as evidence before
the court-martial is a disgrace to
France. "C'est une honte!" was the
remark heard on all sides when the ses
sion closed, and the audience, mainly
made up of Dreyfusards, was being
pressed outside by the gendarmes, who
clear the courtroom as soon as the
court adjourns.
Nevertheless even the Dreyfusards
do not deceive themselves as to
the effect M. Bertilon'sl testimony
or demonstration may have upon
the Judges, who. they fear, will be
gulled by what the Dreyfusards con
sider spurious. All the Judges have
passed through the Ecole Polytech
nique, the highest school of science in
France, and they are thus peculiarly
interested in such "evidence" as that of
Bertiilon. Moreover, with the aid of in
numerable diagrams and specimens of
writing which he submits to them, they
may be able to follow his reasoning in
telligently, which is more than any
member of the audience could do to
day. If the Judges accept Bertillon's
premises â that Dreyfus, as an expert
spy, did not write in ordinary hand- !
writing but in close imitation, even
contriving to give letters the appear
ance of having been traced, in order to
be able to repudiate them as a forgery
if detected â then the structure built
upon the groundwork may be scientific
ally correct. Even Dreyfus, when
shown Bertillon's demonstrations, ad- I
mitted the ingenuity and plausibility of
the system, though he naturally de
clared that it was built upon a false
basis.
A remarkable feature of Bertillon's
deposition was the heat and excite- ''â 
ment he put into what was expected to
be a calm, dispassionate exposition of
his theory. lie thundered, shouted and
waved his arms as though engaged in
some terrible dispute. Once he literally
shrieked, and numbers of the usual j
audience who had been unable to fol- \
low him and were taking the air in the I
courtyard rushed back into the hall,
breathlessly inquiring what had hap- ;
pened and imagining that he was ful- â 
minating some dreadful enunciation of
the accused.
Their excitement turned into hilarity
when they found he was momentarily
impressing upon the Judges the signifi
cance of the exact space, measured in
centimeters, between two words in the
bordereau. The military witnesses, all i
of whom sit in a bunch, leaving Colonel '
Picquart and M. Bertullus severely iso- !
lated, followed M. Bertillon's statement |
with a grave and wise expression of i
countenance, upon which never a sus
picion of a smile appeared, as though
they understood every word. Evidently
they had received a mot d'ordre to pre-.
serve this attitude, for without seeing '
the diagrams they could not have un
derstood any better than 'did the gen- j
eral public.
The Echo de Paris announced to-day â 
that the cousel of Dreyfus had obtained
possession of certain documents men
tioned in the bordereau, in Esterhazy's \
writing, which they would produce in
court next week as a coup de theatre. j
The correspondent inquired as to this
in competent Dreyfusard quarters this
afternoon. He was assured that the
statement was erroneous, but was also
told that the defense intended, in the
event of Captain Dreyfus being re
condemned, to ask the German Govern
ment to communicate these documents, j
proving his innocence, and that they j
had reason to believe such a request
would be granted.

DIPLOMATIC LETTERS

LONDON, Aug. 25.â The Rome correspondent of the Daily Mail says: Italy
and Germany have obtained proofs that diplomatic correspondence passing
between Paris and other places is systematically opened. This has been the
case particularly since the campaign against Dreyfus began, the French
War Office having sought proofs to strengthen the accusations against him.
Questions on this subject will be asked in the Italian Parliament.

M. Bertillon, the noted .-liithropometer,
was called a< th>- next witness. He wore
a dark blue frock coat and carried a high
hat in his hand. ML Bertillon requ<
permission * bring in hi;- diagrams and
papers The request was granted, and M.
Bertillon retired tor a moment, r-tuming
at the heai [uad comp
infantry sergeant and four privates, all
â¢staggering under the weight of Imn
leather Batchels bulging with d
(harts etc., which they deposited on the
stage as a roar .if laughtei â¢
throughout the court. Even the judges
were unable to suppress a smile as they
gazed on M. BertUlon's Btage properties,
Btrewn over half the piatform. A table
was bmught In, upon which thÂ» plans he
was using i ould be placed. The witness
began by saying that only intelligent men
could follow his explanations.
M. Bertillon commenced hia deposition
at s:3" a. m. It occupied the whole of this
session and will perhaps occupy a -
part of to-morrow's session. The court
room presented a curious scene whiii- M.
Bertillon. whom the Dreyfusards in their
most indulgent moments describe as a
"dangerous mania.." Bpent the three re
maining hours of the session In explain
ing in unintelligible terms., his 'Infallib c
SVÂ«tem" of proving Dreyfus the author of
the bordereau. The majority of the pub
lic however, utterly unable to compre
hend M Bertillons theories, had left the
courtroom. Even La Dame Blanche aban
doned her post. In the meantime M. Ber
tillon with gestures and in the shrill,
pitched voice of a quack at a country
fair continued his monologue, producing
every minutr some fresh paper covered
with wonderful hieroglyphics, copies of
which he presented to the Judges, who,
with an expression of owl-like wisdom,
carefully examined them, their heads
clustered together, their eyes gazing on
the" long wide strips of paper, while M.
Bertillon leaned over their table trying to
explain his mystifying diagrams which
were afterward passed to MM. Labor! and
D^mange who, however, apparently did
not derive mu<-h profit from their perusal.
Drevius gazed at the scene with a lo< k
of stupefaction. The clearest utterances
of M Bertillon during the course of Ins
demonstration was that the handwriting
of the bordereau "obeys a geometrical
rythm of which I discovered the equation
In the prisoner's blotting paper."
The witness finally announced that he
would give a practical demonstration of
the writing of the bordereau according to
his system. Then he theatrically cleared
the desk attached to the witness bar,
drew his chair nearer, deposited his high
hat on the floor, and sitting down began
copying the bordereau. The audience
watched him. bent over the desk, busily
drawing letters, the Judgt a gazing at him,
until at. the end of ten minutes the people
and the judges became restlessly impa-
Uent, and Colonel Jouaust remarked that
it was not necessary to copy the whole
bordereau and that a few lines would suf
fice. A few minutes later M. B--rtillon
rose, strode to the Judges' table and laid
before them his copy. The judges, coun

GUERINITES ATTACK
PARISIAN POLICE
PARIS Aug. 25.â M. Guerin and
his followers, who are still be
si'ge-d in the headquarters of the
Anti-Semite League, created some
excitement this afternoon by dis
tributing in the windows of build
ings circulars denouncing the Jews.
When the police prevented the
people from picking up the cir
culars the Guerinites bombarded
the police with bricks.
The police to-day deluged the
walls of the neighborhood of M.
- fort with disinfectants,
owing to the abominable stench
since the water supply was cut off.
At a late hour this evening a re
sorter from the Anti-Juif tried to
evictual the fortress, but was pre
by the police. M. Guerin,
;ncensed,* fired two shots at
man. Neither reached the
alter, but the incident will proba
,,y precipitate matters.
suit The audience watched this strange
spectacle until Colonel Jouaust shrugged
his ildera 'and then the spectators
knew that M. Bertillon had failed to Bat
isfy them. M. Bertillon noticed this and
said more apologetically, "1 was too badly
' M Demange of counsel for the defense
returned to counsel's table, and in re
sponse to a look of inquiry from Dreyfus
whispered a few words to the prisoner,
with a shrug of his shoulders and a smile
on his face. Dreyfus appeared perfectly
satisfied. , . , . ,
Colonel Jouaust then at 11:43 o clock ad
journed the court, and M. Bertillon packed
up his belongings and the soldiers carried
tnem out. The newspaper men who
crowded around M. Labori asked him for
his impressions, lie said there was a
certain resemblance to the bordereau,
"But that is all. M. Bertillon only did
what dozens could do. It only proves he
is a clever forger. That Is all."
Following are the more important pro
ceedings in detail:
M Henri Weiil, a former officer of the
headquarters staff, was then called, but
he was absent and his deposition was
reed The facts in the case were pub
lished April 20. M. Weill's statement in
substance was that Esterhazy told him
in 1&34 that Dreyfus was innocent, but that
this would not prevent his conviction, be
cause he was a Jew. (Sensation.)
A former sergeant, who was at one time
employed in the War Office, testified to
having seen Dreyfus copying the list of
ralroad stations mentioned In the plan l of
mobilization, to which Dreyfus replied,
"It is true, but I copied the list by order
of Captain Besle." (Sensation.)
The evidence of the handwriting experts
followed. M. Gqbert, after testifying to
the facts published April 22 and April 24.
vehemently piotested against the insinua
tion that he was on Interested witness.
The court closely followed M. Gobert's
exhaustive story of his examination of the
bordereau and his interviews with Gen
erals Mercior, De Boisdeffre and Gonse.
M. Gobert asserted that the handwriting
of the bordereau was natural, but that it
was almost illegible, whereas Dreyfus,
even when writing rapidly, always wrote
most legibly.
The witness asked General Gonse if an
envelope accompanied the bordereau, as
he, M. Gobert. wished to see what the
writer's careful caligraphy was like, ex
plaining that the address of a letter was
always In a firmer hand than its contents.
General Gonse refused the request on the
ground that the witness must not know
the names of the addresses. The general
also refused to allow the bordereau to be
photographed, alleging that if the War
Office photographers were allowed to
photograph it all Paris would be ac
quainted with the bordereau the next day.
(Laughter.) Thereupon the witness re
marked:
"General Gonse. this is a very Interest
ing confession. '
M. Gobert then suggested that the work
be Intrusted to the Prefecture of Police,
where M. Bertillon Is the photographer.
Until then, the witness said, he had never
heard of M. Bertillon as a handwriting
expert, saying he became an expert for
this special Occasion, when he was called
into the War Office. (Laughter.)
General Gonse, it appears from the tes
timony, was greatly enraged when he
learned of the result of M. Gobert's ex
amination of the bordereau and visited
the expert repeatedly. The latter always

bordereau, and after a few hours' study !
M. Bfcrtillon positively attributed the
bordereau to Dreyfus
From thai time forward M. Gobert
heard no more of the Dreyfus case. He
was not asked to submit a report, but
described to . the then Minister of Jus
tice, M. Guerin, the circumstances in the
case.
â  "M. Guerin," continued the witness, "in- :
timated that these were soldiers' affairs, !
which did not concern him as chief of !
the civil judiciary."
Colonel Jouaust asked M. Gobert for j
a more definite criticism of the bordereau. I
and the witness replied that he noticed j
certain similarities between the hand
writing of the bordereau and that of j
Dreyfus, but. he added, that here were
important differences which proved to '
him that Dreyfus was not the author of I
the bordereau, and his opinion had since i
been confirmed "because it was now
proved the bordereau was the work of â 
Esterhazy." (Sensation.)
Replying to the court, M. Gobert sug- :
gested that the Judges compare the borde
reau with a letter admitted to be in !
Esterhazy's handwriting, and dated from !
Rouen. August 17, liS4, and with docu
ments written by the prisoner.
"You will then, unmistakably, recog
nize," said M. Gobert, "that the borde
reau is in Esterhazy's handwriting and i
not in the handwriting of Dreyfus." i
(Great sensation.)
The witness at this puricture identified
the bordereau" as the same which was
submitted to him. and he proceeded to '
point out the identity therein with let- :
ters admittedly written by Esterhazy, I
Faying that, while the resemblance was
not apparent in Dreyfus' handwriting, in
Esterhazy's there were marked peculiari- I
ties, of punctuation and the manner of be- j
ginning lines which were also noticeable
in the bordereau, but which were not j
found in the prisoner's caligraphy.
There was a general movement of curi
osity when M. Bertillon, the well-known
anthropometer (or specialist in the meas
urements of the human body) was called. i
M. Bertillon prefaced his evidence by say- !
ing his explanations would be understood
only by a very limited number, and there
fore he asked the court to permit him to j
refer to documents which he had brought I
in order to make his evidence more intel- j
ligible, Laughter. The specialist then'
unpacked packages of photographs, plans.*
etc., and another table was brought in to |
1 hold the mass of papers produced. In
: monotonous tones if. Bertillon proceeded,
in the manner of a schoolboy reciting a j
lesson, to -demonstrate technically how
he reached the conviction of Dreyfus'
guilt, reciting the facts published on April
21. He said he proposed to prove to th-* !
court:
Firstâ That the bordereau was a doc- <
tored document.
Secondâ That it could only have been
manufactured by the prisoner.
Thirdâ That it had been written in a \
free hand by means of a key word placed I
beneath tracing paper in such a way as to
be quite visible. " I
The witness, continuing, declared that I
Dreyfus did not have recourse to imi
tating Esterhazy's freehand writing, be- !
cause it required too long to study, and he !
use . the tracing process because it is '
easier to learn and more likely to be suc
cessful. With a view of frustrating his :
meaning. M. Bertillon handed around pho
tographs or the bordereau, etc. During
the course of the demonstration the spe
cialist advanced to the judges' bench and
with his finger pointed out illustrations of
his theory. MM. Demunge and Labori
the judges and others gathered in a
group around the anthropometer.
Dreyfus appeared to be stupefied by the 1
comparatively incomprehensible jargon '
and many of the audience left the court' !
Suddenly the wonderment of those re-'
maining in the hall was riveted by the i
cryptographic remark enunciated by M !
Beriiilun in loud tones:
"We clearly have before us a fabricated ;
document. The one word always rests on
the other with a diverge of 1.25 millimeters '
and 2.20 millimeters. That is a phenom
enon which is unnatural."
M. Labori watched the specialist for a
few momenta and then returned to his
seat, holding up both hands and exclaim- I
ing. "It is most extraordinary."
M. Bertillon continued his explanation? '
and caused such a whirl in the brains of
hi.Â« hearers that Colonel Jouaust finally j
remarked, "We must have a few minutes'
rest. \

Commandant P. J. Joubert issued to-day a circular to all field cornets cautioning them
against any action tending to bring on a conflict with another power. He declares that not a single
stranger who does not volunteer is to be coerced into bearing arms.
Commandant Viljoen has given notice in the Volksraad that he will ask the Government if, in

In the course of an interview after the session Commandant Viljoen said if war broke out

CAPE TOWN, Aug. 25.â 1n the Cape House of Assembly to-day, anticipating a motion on
the subject by Sir Gordon Spriggs, former Premier, W. P. Schreiner, the President, volunteered an
explanation regarding the transit through Cape Colony of ammunition and rifles for the Orange
Free State.
Mr. Schreiner contended that, except in time of war, the prohibition of such transit would
be a breach of the customs convention. He laid upon the table papers confirming his state
ment as to the details of the war material so transmitted, and then added that if war should
unhappily ensue, he would do his duty as an earnest and loyal subject of the Queen.
Sir John Gordon Spriggs. having moved the adjournment of the House. Mr. Rose-lnnes, for
mer leader of the opposition, asked whether the Governor of the colony. Sir Alfred Milner, has re
quested the Government to prohibit the transit.
Mr. Schreiner replied in the negative. After further discussion, in which Sir John Gordon
Spriggs dissented from the view that the customs convention prevented the prohibition, the sub
ject was dropped.
NEW YORK, -\uer. 25. â George W. Van Si-Hen, a lawyer nf ;his city, has received an interesting letter fro-rn

"Now I will not insist that the Transvaal Goy.rnm<>nt is infallible and perfect, but as compared with Fn

"But this England never will do nor dare to do. The plan of Chamberlain is not to rome to an understands

ASIATICS OVERRUN
HAWAIIAN ISLANDS
Figures Taken From the Official Records
Show an Alarming Increase of
Coolie Immigrants.
By HORACE U/RIGHT.
HONOLULU. Aug. 18.â Denuded
of its delightful romance and
regarded from the serious
standpoint of a political study,
Hawaii is but an insignificant
portion of the sovereign dominion of
the United States; but, as its hurried
acquisition somewhat threatens to
change the forms and principles of
i government heretofore existing under
! Federal rule, there may be some justi
| fication in presenting to the people of
i the United States, through The Call, a
few serious figures for their careful ,
consideration before Congress deter
mines the form of government to be al
lotted to her recently acquired posses
| sions, which may fancifully be called a
I sugar depot and planters' paradise in
the land of dolce far nlente, eternal
'â  summer and luscious life.
i These figures may not be deemed
' encouraging by those who believe that
the predominance of Americans is a
necessary precursor of civilization and
progress under the stars and stripes.
! They will not tend to show that Hawaii
is, under existing conditions, or those
likely to rule tor years to come, un
less an unexpected political and social
i cataclysm overwhelms them, a coun
try much to be envied as the rearing
I grounds of the Anglo-Saxons or Teu
i tonic races. They will only the more
! strongly emphasize the evils inflicted
land to.be laflicted unless a remedy be
' promptly applied upon the white races
.by the immense inbringing of Asiatic
i laborers to create Hawaiian prosper
i ity mainly and to spread broadcast a
superficial knowledge of the English
language and the rudiments of Chris
tianity. 4 . Â
Make every allowance for the noble
â¢ efforts of our pioneer missionaries and
their wealthy descendants in creating
for us Intellectual progress and ma
terial prosperity, but then the figures
1 become all the darker and more
ominous in comparison by the fact that
they are the results accomplished by
those who seized the holm of govern
' ment by revolution in urder to Ameri
, canize "it and give to it the blessed
: freedom for the white man conferred
by the American constitution. These
figures expose the rank hypocrisy of
the annexationists.

ment, Q. S. V-. also wired to the Gov
ernor to send a quantity of carbines
and supply of ammunition for the
BOldiers. Tolonel Lawton was here
this morning to investigate the Situa
tion. After a conference with the offi
cials he returned to Savannah.
When the Governor received the mes
sage from Sheriff Blount he ordered
Colonel Lawton to return if necessary
:u 1 take command of the militia. He
is now here in that capacity and has
j enough men, it is believed, to easily
handle the situation. The Sheriff and
i his deputies continue to make arrests
of the rioting negroes and the jail has
a large number in it, notwithstanding
the fact that the towhoat Iris left
here this morning for Savannah with
twenty-five rioters who had been ar
rested. This was a precautionary
measure to prevent an attack on th>
1 jail by the negro friends of those Im
prisoned and to make room for those
who have been arrested since the re
moval.
Th" situation here is regarded as
critical, although with determined mili
tary control it is thought further
trouble can be prevented. It is esti
mated that the negroes outnumber the
whites in this part of Georgia five to
on<- and the whites aiv consequently
apprehensive. John Delagell, the negro
who killed Deputy Sheriff Joseph Town
send and wounded Deputy Hopkins,
who were trying, to arrest him, can
not be found. He is the son of Henry
Delagell, whose arrest for assault
started the trouble.
The seventy-five members of the
First Georgia, who were left here two
day ago when old man Delagell was
taken to Savannah, are patrolling the
town to-night. All the saloons are
closed. Nearly every n<>gro left town
this mo-rning. and to-night word comes
that they are massed in Delageil's
swamp, twelve miles from town. They
I All othersâ Men, 1782; women, 969;
! children. 323, or a total of 6174.
It will be seen, therefore, that in
; eleven months there was an increase
J in the population of 14,710, but of what
â  character? Chinese, 1659; Japanese,
: 11,280, and of the white races, includ
' ing the Portuguese, only 1771 as against
: 12,939 Asiatics.
Look at it in another light. Of thÂ»
I 2767 Chinese arriving 40 per cent left
j the country; of the 13,128 Japanese only
' 14.7 per cent left, and of the 4524 of
j other races 63.7 per cent left. The total
j departures were 29.6 per cent of the
; total arrivals.
Regarded from another view point of
14.710 persons remaining to increase the
population and to become Americans
the percentage of Chinese was 11.3, of
Japanese 76.7, of Portuguese 0.1, and of
all others 11.9.
The proportion of women to each 100
men was 11 Chinese, 26 Japanese, 53
: Portuguese and 59 for all other races.
I That alone is a calamity, remembering
j the already very' large preponderance
of men over women.
To-day the steamship Toyo Maru
brought us 700 more Japanese, and the
1 pleasing news that the Raukoku Maru
has another 700 and the Carmartheu
shire at the least 200 more. The im
i pression exists that the Cabinet will
decline to issue any permits for the last
1 quarter of the year, but probably when
: the time arrives October will see an
; other 5000 granted beyond the 9300
i granted for the present quarter.
It is now generally understood that
both the Hawaiian Government and the
I Planters' Labor and Supply Association
j will be represented at Washington by
special agents. The names of W. A.
Kinney and W. O. Smith are those most
I prominently mentioned in connection
j with Congressional efforts.

The Hawaiian Census.
HONOLULU. Aug. 18.â Alatan T. Atkin
son, editor <>f the Hawaiian Star, received
by the Moana's mail his commission from
the interior Department census bureau as
i HiÂ».<uril agent of the census bureau fur
j Hawaii, a companying it was a letter
' from tho superintendent of the twelfth
census directing him to proceed to Wash
irurt"ii as soon as practicable to consult
: with the bureau in regard to census con
â  ditiona and in tho preparation of sched
ules. He is requested to bring with him
all available published data In regard to
population, products and Industries of the.
I Islands. Blank schedules used in taking
the last census in Alaska accompanied the

thÂ»- scope: and extent which the census will
I take.
are known to be assembled, and a
posse of citizens left on a special train
for the place at 8 oVlook. They will
maintain a guard over the negroes and
keep them from doing any damage to
night. A telegram was sent to Bruns
wick, urging all white citizens to come
to Darien. A boat was dispatched to
bring them to this city, and a special
train will be ready in case more want
to come. The presence of the whites is
wanted to overawe the negroes, who
are well aware of their superiority in
numbers.
WILL TAKE ACTION
AGAINST THE NEGROES
Militia Will Surround Them in a
Swamp and Proceed to Take
Away Their Guns.
DARTEX. Or., Aug. 26.â A conference
was held at midnight to-niglit between
Sheriff Blount, military officials and a
citizens' committee, and it was decided
to take decisive action at daylight
against the negroes who are masked
and armed in Delagell swamp, twelve
miles from this city.
The Sheriff wired Colonel Lawton,
who is in Savannah, to-night to send
the militia at once, and he received a
reply to the effect that the men are
ready and that the Liberty County
troops will start from Hainesville for
Darlen at 2 o'clock.
The Mclntosh Dragoons are at their
armory here with horses ready. Th^ |
citizens move from Darien on a special i
train for the swamp at 3 o'clock and
the militia, about 150 in number, one
hour later.
The negroes are armed in defiance of ;
the law and the purpose of the militia
is t<! surround the swamp and relieve
the blacks of their firearms and arrest
them. The two special trains are be
ing prepared.
Governor Candler gave Colonel Law
ton plenary power In the matter, and
it was not found necessary to call upon
the chief executive of the State for the
militia.

LOS ANGKLES. Aug. 2o.â Since Monday
last H. H. Kdmunds, compiler of the Los
Angeles directory, has been missing. It
is believed ho has shipped on some vessel
bound for ,< foreign port. He left many
debts behind, it is alleged, and dishonored
checks amounting to $SO. He has a wife
living at 2665 Orchard avenue. She was
suing for a divorce and claims to know
nothing about her husband.
PHYSICIANS TO
BE SUMMONED
AT THE INQUEST
Did Not Report Mrs.
Dunn's Death.
This morning two prominent physicians
âDr. William Boericke and Dr. George
H. Palmerâ will be summoned by Coroner
Hill to explain why they did not report
the death of Mrs. Jane L. Dunn, wife of
James Dunn, the vice president and man
ager of the American Biscuit Company,
to the proper authorities. There may be
a squabble on both sides. The Coroner,
who has possession of the body and who
will hold an inquest to-day, claims the
physicians should have given him notice
of the death, and the physicians, on the
other hand, assert that the cause of death
i as stated by them should not become the
subject of a Morgue Investigation.
Mrs. Dunn unfortunately partook of an
overripe cantaloupe on Sunday evening.
Shortly afterward she was taken ill and
death ensued about ti o'clock on Wednes
day evening, notwithstanding the efforts
of Dr. Boericke and Dr. Palmer, ihe latter
being called on the day of death. Mr.
Dunn and the remainder of the family,
including a servant girl, also ate the
| germ-laden fruit and narrowly escaped
j death. Last night they were all nearly
recovered and the only evidence remain-
I ing of the sad repast is the corpse of the
i mother, which has been refused burial
i until an inquest can be held.
Yesterday morning a representative of
N. Gray & Co.. undertakers, presented a
death certificate to the Board of Health
and asked that a burial permit be. issued.
The certificate was signed by Dr. William
! Boericke, and stated that death had been
! the result of ptomaine poisoning. The doc
' tor certified that he had attended the case
j two days. When the clerks in the Health
Office noted the cause of death they re
fused to issue the permit and notified
Coroner Hill. As a consequence the Coro
ner will subpena Dr. Boericke and Dr.
Palmer to ascertain their reasons for not
notifying the Morgue soon after Mrs.
Dunn expired.
Both the physicans were seen last night.
Dr. Palmer shuffles all responsibility on
Dr. Boericke. saying that it was not his
case, and the latter doctor contends that
; In cases of ptomaine poisoning where the
physician is certain as to what produced
i death It is not necessary to notify the
Morgue officials. Both opinions will be
given an airing at the inq.uest to-day.
A FREAK OF THE SEA.
The Tug Alert Meets With a Queer j
Experience.
While the tug Alert was towing the ;
ship Alden Besse from the Heads last
night a peculiar accident occurred. The
tug shipped a sea and was struck by a
wave which washed over the deck. The ,
â  water gushed through a window In the ;
: deckhouse, and tearing a door from its
; fastenings dashed it against Assistant
Engineer Gus Holtz. who was at his post i
of duty. The man was picked up uncon
scious, but was not seriously Injured.
Shipping men pronounce the occurrence j
as most peculiar and novel.
PICKED UP IN THE BAY.
Body of Thomas Hobarlan, Who Dis
appeared Some Time Ag-o, Found.
The body of Thomas Hobarlan, a black
smith, residing at 116 Pacific street, was '
picked up off the Spear-street wharf ye?- j
terday morning. It had evidently been in '
the water for about ten days.
Hobarlan was last seen on Monday,
August 14. He was drinking heavily and
several times had threatened suicide.
WTiether he slipped from the wharf while
intoxicated cir carried o\:t his threat of
suicide is not known. His body remained
unldentitied for some hours, but it wu^ ;
iin.'illy rt-ct>u:nizod by J. Brown and F. No
vak, barbers at 110 Pacific street. Tin
man was unmarried and about 35 years of
age.
Creelman MaXes Denial.
Bob Croelman. the rare track tout, who
has been anxiously sought for by the
i police in connection with the flight of
i Howard, the gigantic swindler, returned
to this city yesterday and placed himself
in communication with the police. Last
evening he visited police headquarters
and was closely Questioned by Detective j
Tom Gibson. While admitting that he is
Howard's confidential friend Creelman
persistently denied that he assisted him
in getting out of the State. Notwith
standing his denial the police are satis
tied that he not only shared Howard's ill
gotten gains, but advised him to skip
when lie learned that warrants had been
Issued for his arrest charging him with
swindling Capitalist Green.
Robbed of His Gold.
Pearl Hutchingson was arrested last
evening by Police Sergeant Anderson of
the California police station on the com
plaint of D. M. Reese and charged with
grand larceny. Reese alleges that the
woman robbed him of $50, which charge'
she stoutly denies, saving that another
woman took the money.
TRAIL TO GOLD
MINES OF ALASKA
DENVER. A up. 25.â General Merriam. !
commanding this department, has re
ceived advices which had him to the be
lief that before this winter a passable
trail will have been established across ;
Alaska's fields from tidewater to the gold
mines in the interior. The entire road
will be upon American soil.
"Another attempt is h.iriK made," said
the general, "and by the same officers.
I would not recommend any one trying to
go over the road at this time, but I be- ;
lleve the trail will be completed this year, j
The prospects are good." ]
While Genera] M^rrkun was in command
of the Department of the Columbia he
nursed the idea of having the military au- i
thoritiea t-stablish a trail or road from j
tidewater to the gold mines in thÂ» in- |
terlor, the entire route to be over Ameri
can soil. The War Department acted fa
vorably upon this suggestion and thr c
expeditions were sent out. The two last
year left in March and returned in the lat
ter part of October. During the trip
overland First Lieutenant Castner, ac
cording to the report, underwent the most '
severe hardships. Still another attempt
is being madf to push the trail to comple
tion and General Merriam is confident
that by the last of this year the road will
be passable its entire length.

CONSUL BEDLOE
HERE EN ROUTE
TO WASHINGTON
Suspended Diplomat
at the Palace.
Consul Edward Bedloe, who has been
stationed at Canton, China, ever since the
inauguration of President McKinley and
who has been suspended from that po
sition by the State Department and grant
ed permission to return to the United
States, arrived in this city a few daj
and is staying at the Palace. He is on his
way to Washington.
When -Mr. Bedloe took apartments at
the Palace he uid not register, conse
quently the fact of his arrival here did
not leak out until yesterday.
The Consul was relieved by the State
Department for having, it is claimed,
given the filibustering steamer Abbey a
certificate of American registry. Th< Ab
bey was seized last September ;<t Ban
tagaa by tht- United States gunboat Mc-
Culloch whlU' attempting t" land a
of arms and ammunition for the Filipino
a i my.
The authorities at Washington, with
whom Dr. Bedloe has considerable pres
tige, are satisfied thai the Consul was not
implicated in the attempt to land the
stores of war. There arc a few matters
in connection with the affair that the
State Department probably desires ex
plained and for this n aspn i; is thought
Dr. Bedloe has been recalled. His friends
in Philadelphia, many of whom are high
in the favor of President McKinley, nave
implicit confidence in the Consul and the,
fit-! assured that he will be able to ex
plain matters to the satisfaction of the
State Department. While I >r. Bedloe had
no absolute legal authority to grant the
certificate of American ownership to the
filibuster he is authorized to protect and
father the rights of American ship owners
and assist them according to his judg
ment.
In diplomatic circles Dr. Bedloe's sus
pension is believed to be due to a misun
derstanding, which, he c\n easily justify
when he returns to Washington.
Dr. Bedloe is ore of the most prominent
citizens of Philadelphia. He is a writer
of unusual ability and was one of tin'
first to use his pen in favor of American
progress in China. He has written several
books on this and other subjects. Dr.
Hedlne refuses to discuss his affairs foi
publication.

State Fair's Success Assured.
The State Fair at Sacramento, to be
hold next month, promises to be the most
successful in the history of the State Ag
ricultural Society, '.he great pavilion of
the society, covering three acres of
ground, has already been appropriated by
exhibitors. This vast . area will be tilled
with the finest specimens of fruits, grains
and grasses grown in the State, together
with the most novel and modern manu
facturing and agricultural machinery,
which will be shown In motion. A model
creamery, a silo and an art gallery will
be attractive features. A cooking- school
Will be maintained and various articles
will be manufactured in view of the pub
lic.
At the park all breeds of livestock of
finest specimens from all over th' United
States will be shown. Racing will be con
ducted for two weeks. â  Large fields of
the best trained horses in the State are
entered in the various races. ' A splendid
musical programme and entertainments
will be rendered every evening. at the
pavilion. The exhibits are coming from
all over the State, and a large attendance
from all directions Is assured.
AMATEURS CANNOT BOX.
Excelsior Athletic Club Refused a
Permit by the Supervisors.
In future it will be Impbsslble for un
trained boxers to engage in a legal boxing
match. The memory of a recent death in
tin- ring has caused the Health arid Police
Committee of the Hoard of Supervisors to
refuse to sanction further amateur con
tests. The application of the Kxe.elsior
Athletic Club for a permit to hold con
tests was yesterday refused. The reasons
for the refusal are set forth in the follow
ing report:
"The instructions that have been im
posed heretofore have not, in view of a
recent death in a fistic encounter, been
observed, and to allow amateurs to give
such exhibitions is to invite and encourage
contests that may be fatal to one or more
of the participants."
Sheriff Martin's plea for drugs and
medicines with which to fill prescriptions
at the County Jails was then
taken up. The committee, in view
of the fact that the appropriation is
Inadequate to meet the requirements
decided to call upon some public-minded
citizen for the necessary drugs md
pledged themselves to do' all In' their
power to reimburse such citizen in the
future.

by David Cahill of Lexington. Ky., win

Wednesday. Charley Herr, Tomboy aid
Lecco having two heats each. Tomboy,
at the time of postponement, was a ta.lt
favorite, but he was sick Thursday and
to-day he had no chance to win. acting
lifeless. Ilerr became the favorite and
by trotting an honest mile won in almost
a" dead heat with Lecco. The latter broke
three times, but at the end closed up
yards of distance. Through the last eighth
the two horses came almost neck and
neck. It is claimed that upward of $100,000
depended on the event. The track was
quite soft after two days' soaking, but the
Jun dried out the course late In the after
noon.
Of the regular events the 2:07 pace was
the fastest and the 2:10 trot the most split
up.
The 2:l* trot went to Senator L after
Pilot Evans each time had come into the
stretch in the lead. Both finishes were in
doubt until the wire was reached and
Pilot Evans only lost by a head. Senator
L belongs to T. W. Dellinger of Portland,
Ind.
The 2:10 trot, which finally went to the
Toledo stallion. Cresceus, the favorite,
was a rattling affair. Cresceus had been
beaten In two heats through Geers' excel
lent handling of Dare Devil. The latter
seemed to tir* 1 after that and to lose his
feet when close pressed by the field, al
though he had generally benefited by a
good send-off. Results:

Corinthians Will Escort the Home-
Coming Craft to Their Moorings
at Tiburon To-Morrow.
Thp San Francisco Yacht Club contribu
ted its share to the marine parade on
Thursday, the following boats flying Its
burgee at their mastheads: The schooners
J^urline. Aggie. Ramona. Chlspa, Outing
and Rover, the yawl Tramontana and thm
sloop Sappho. The sloop Pactolus, flagship
of the Calif ornias, was withdrawn because
of Commodore Allen M. Clay's serious ill
ness, but the yawl Idler and the sloop Oc
cident represented the club. The Corin
thian yachts towed in the parade were the
sloops Harpoon, Clara, Speedwell and
Elia.
Last Saturday the yawl Frolic joined the
cruise of the San Franciscos to Vallejo,
and on Sunday her owner, E. C. Bartlett,
accompanied by Mrs. Bartlett, started on
an up-river cruise. The San Francisco
yawl Phyllis recently returned to Sausa
llto.
The necessary changes in the rig and
trim of the San Francisco challenger for
the Perpetual cup have been made, and a
trial of her speed will soon tÂ«e had. The
Corinthians are not under any .obligation
to name their defender until the morning
of the race, provided only that they are
ready to defend on some day not later
than September 30. They are at liberty to
choose a boat suitable to the weather pre
vailing on the day appointed. A commit
tee from the Corinthian and San Francis
co clubs will arrange a mating to discuss
details. The regatta of tin Pacific Inter
club Yacht Association, to be held in Sep
tember, will afford an opportunity to try
out the boats which might serve as de
fenders of the cup.
Commodore T. L. Hill will employ to
morrow morning in repairing the t>ack-

Sir Thomas Lipton Says That Is All
He Asks for the Shamrock.
LONDON, Aup. 25.â Sir Thomas Ltp
ton, owner >>f the America"s cup chal

day regarding the secrecy that has
been maintained about the yacht's

about the Shamrock than the Colum

the Columbia had been publicly ex
hibited nor that anything; more was
known about her than the Shamrock.
Continuing, Sir Thomas Lipton said:
"When the official measurer does his
work every detail will be known. It
will be a square race with no imped

make a protest. Mr. Iselin is as deter

â¢ HONOLULU. Aug. 18.â "Washington City Will have a real Hawaiian â¢
O luau, with pol, fish, other delicacies, leis, music and dancing. Prince g

S8 weighing 1,200 pounds, containing all required for putting on an elabor- g
$ ate feast, on the Doric, and left for Washington by the same steamer. g
a The poi, fish, seaweed, etc., were frozen in ice by the Hawaiian ft
Si Electric Company and then securely . packed to keep a month or so. 2S
O From San Francisco the cases will go by express to Washington. They Â«
will not be opened until the day of the luau. q

KEPT PORTUGUESE
FROM HAWAII
Peculiar Procedure of
Consul Jones.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HONOLULU, Aug. IS.â There Is a big
row in Madeira over the Portuguese la
borers ordered by the Planters' Labor and
Supply Company from that country.
Consul Jones, head of the United States
consulates in the group, started the muss.
i At the time lumj laborers had booked for
i Honolulu. When the laborers were get
ting ready to sail Consul Jones went to
them and told them they were going to
American territory and that their con
tracts were not worth the paper they
wore written on. He warned them not to
ship. The laborers flew to the agency
enlisting them. No explanations would
suffice and many of them demanded that
the matter be referred to the Government
at Lisbon.
Consul Jones himself write to the Amer
ican Minister at Lisbon, the matter went
before the Portuguese Government and
the position of the Consul was there sus
: tamed. Most of the immigrants imme
diately backed out.
Immediately after this Consul Jones
wrote tii the Washington Government,
! giving in detail all that had taken place.
' The St;.te Department corrected him in
I several points. One Btatement was that
Hawaii was fully under American terri
torial laws. \ho department stated that
the contracts wÂ»>re in full force and would
,so remain until Congress had extended
American laws to the islands.
Consul Jones' letter was forwarded to
â¢a Agent Bewail with Instructions
that he refer it to the Hawaiian Gov
ernment. The points upon which the
Washington Government had con
Consul Jones were marked. Mr. Bewail
delivered the letter yesterday and it was
before rtie Cabinet this morning. Presi
dent Dole remarked that the letter bristles
with misstatements.
The evident intention of Consul Jonett
was to prevent if possible the departure
of the Portuguese from Madeira. What
his motives were are of course not known.
In his letter to tne Washington Govern
ment he States that the immigrants are
anarchists and cut-throats, and urges the
department to take every precaution to
keep thÂ»-m from landing on American soil,
: for they would be the worst sort of citl-
ZÂ£ This statement will not go far here and
Beema to indicate somÂ» motive behind the
I whole proceeding. Nearly all the Portu
guese in the Hawaiian Islands come Imm
neighborh i of Funchal and St.
Michaels ami are the same class as < on
sul Jones calls -anarchists and cut
throats.' Many of those booked for the
Islands at this time are probabij relatnes
of the Portuguese here.
Little attention will \>o paid by the Gov
r-rnment to the correspondence save to
'< further correct the letter of Consul Jones
and return it to Washington. To cor
rect it however, will be to practicajly
rewrite' it. for there are very few words
of actual fact In it.
The incident is important because it

TROUBLE OVER HAWAIIAN
QUARANTINE EXPENSES
Both the Government and Steamship
Companies Refuse to Pay Claims
of Merchants.
HONOLULU, Aug. 19.â Yap Ah Sap and
Bee Ah Kan, two Chinese who attempted

have been turned over to Chinese Agent
Brown by order of the Supreme Court.
Both men have been deported.
The United Stati-s Government has de
clined to pay the expense attached to the
quarantine of last winter, when a large
number of Chinee, were refused a land

AMERICAN INDUSTRY.
London Statist Prophesies Increased
Prosperity for This Country.
LONDON, Aug. 25.â The Statist, under
I the caption "American Prosperity," will
' say: BOH
"There will be very large exports of
wheat to meet the demands of Western
Europe American farmers are disposing
of their crops rapidly and at toler
ably good prices, and they will be
able to purchase from the East
and from Europe as fully as they
have been doing this year. The United
States has made great progress of late
years in manufacturing and trading, but
ft is still essentially an agricultural coun
try and its prosperity depends mainly on
the harvests. Therefore fair wheat and
good harvests of other productions mean
the continuance of the well being of the
farmers, who are the backbone and life
blood of the country."
The Statist then adds: ,;;
"Under the circumstances, it is reason
ably curtain that railroad traffic returns
and foreign orders for locomotives, steel,
etc.. will continue to Increase."
The tenor of the article prophesies an
Increase of the present prosperity of the
United States. â¢' ;~::r:.; â¢; >â "-'

EASTERN MARKETS,
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Aug. 25.â There was a marked
decline In activity in the stock market to-day,
total sales falling to less than 0,000 shares.
Very little evidence was left of the recent up
ward tendency of securities. The spots of
strength were few and far between, and for the
most part -.-ure and usually inactive
stocks, which moved under the influence of
special causes. Depression from foreign stock !
markets, which was rejected here, and Increas
ing anxiety over to-morrow's bank statement I
were the impelling causes of the
heaviness. Financial centers In Europe
obviously labor under renewed uneasi
ness over the situation in the Trans- '
vaal. There was in addition the pros
pect of a holiday to-morrow on the London Ex- \
change tn discourage new commitments there. I
The buying in New York from thai source was |
discontinued entirely, and sales for London !
account were sufficient to exercise a notably
depressing influence. There was an opening
Kpurt In American Tobacco, which carried It i
un 1U per cent, but this was almost imme
diately lost. The laities were weak for :
the rest of the day. Sugar being under severe
pressure nt times. Its extreme decline was â 
S 1 .* and its net loss only a point less. Brook
lyn Transit and Manhattan succumbed to the
prevailing weakness. There was a notable buy
ing movement in l.'nion Pacific preferred based
on suggestions of a good increase In dividends,
which carried the price about 80. Consoli- !
dated Gas, following yesterday's dividend re
duction and a Feml-official intimation that even
the reduced dividend was not earned, climbed
up an extreme 9% on the urgent demand from
the short interests. Brooklyn Union Gas gained
6*4- There was continued strength In a group
of minor grangers, St. Paul and Duluth lead
ing with a rise of 7 points. Rio Grande and
"Western preferred and Oregon Navigation were
other points of strength. Liquidation was not
urgent In the general list, the market falling
Into Intense dullness with the declining tend
ency. The known movements of money for the
week indicate a loss In cash to the ranks of
nearly 53.500.000, $2,297,000 of which went to the i
sub-treasury. None of the gold which went re
cently to Montreal ha.s been returned and no
gold has come fro.m the sub-treasury on ac
count of drafts from the San Francisco Mint.
Without regard, therefore, to the possible hid
den drain of cash, a sharp decline In surplus
reserves is probable unless the contraction in I
Joans has been much larger than appeared.
The late decline In the money rate to 2 per
cent had little significance. â  The rate was !
quite firm during the day, about 3 per cent. :
Contrary to recent experience, sterling ex
chance failed to weaken in response to the I
firmness of money here, but hardened a frac
tion under the influence of London sales of
securities in New York.
Dealings In bonds were mostly In the specu- :
lative Issues, wijh improved prices. Total sales, ;
jar value, t2.37J.GC0. United States new fours i
declined in the bid I rice.

Bradstreet's on Trade.
j $ . $>
NEW YORK. Aug. 25.â Bradstreefs to-mor
row will say: Strength in prices and steadiness
of demand are still the salient features of the
trade situation. Iron, steel and other metals,
! most of the cereals, leather and cotton goods,
' manifest upward tendencies as to prices. Other
staples, with the exception of sugar and anthra
j cite coal, retain all their old firmness. Fall
demand is expanding at most markets, par
| ticularly good reports being received from the
: Northwest and the section of the corn-grow-
I ing country which this year seems likely to be
notable for surplus production. Aggressive
' strength and firmness is noted In iron and
steel, particularly at central Western markets.
Consideration of next year's needs now seems
to be the most prominent feature of the trade,
as) ie from complaints of slow deliveries on
near-by orders. Foremost in â¢ advancing is
structural material, which has moved up $5 per
ton, closely followed by steel billets with an
! advance of $3 and steel rails and nearly all
! grades of pic iron, with smaller relative gains.
Other metals show sympathetic strength,
! notable in this respect being tin and lead.
Wheat has been quite firm all the week, partly
owing to a whittling down of Northwestern
estimates, but also due to steady demand for
! the cash article alike on foreign and domestic
account. A sudden cut in prices of refined
; sugar has led to the impression that the sugar
â  war will be reopened in all its fierceness. Ad
' ditionally strong features in the general trade
situation are the active demand for lumber at
I mout markets at steady prices and the firmness
, in the higher grades of wool, notwithstanding
less active buying. A supporting feature in
' this latter case, however, is the active demand
I reported alike for men's and women's wear
j woe! goods. Conditions of supply and demand
I seem to be at the bottom of the recent rise in
J beef prices. This advance has attracted in
] creased receipts of grass-fed cattle, and some
: shading i.f quotations is noted, but Chicago
j prices have only been equaled five times in
twenty-two years. There were nearly 10.000,000 j
less beef cattle in the country than there were
seven years ago. and in fact, there are fewer i
cattle In the country now than In any year
I r:nce ICS2.1 C S2. Reflection of the smaller supply of
: hides i- i of the active demand for boots and
j shoes is found in higher quotations for hemlock
I s..le leather at some markets. One Of the least
satisfactorily situated trades is that of anthra- :
cite coal, in which production appears to have
outstripped consumption again, and there is
complaint of price cutting. \

Dun's Review of Trade.
* â Â»
NEW YORK. Aug. 23.â R. G. Pun & Co.'s
! weekly review of trade to-iiinrrow will say:
Nothing Is more eloquent than the facts. Ac
tual payments through the principal clearing
houses were 23 per cent larger than last year
and 56.2 per cent larger than in the same week
In 1552. For the month thus far the dally aver
age of payments is 26.3 per cent larger than
last year and 56 per cent larger. than in 1892.
Tonnage from Chicago in three weeks has been
SO per cent larger than last >ear and 74. per
cent larger than in 1892. It will not be sug
gested by anybody that such an astonishing
Increase over the most prosperous of all past
years except the last was exaggerated. Most
people really regarded last year's expansion
as something like a freak. Wor Is the differ
ence in amount of payments mainly due to
rise In prices, for prices of several kindred
articles actually range lower on the whole than
in August, 1592.
It is a consumers' business also. Perhaps
never before have demands fcr actual use con
trolled business and prices with so little spec
ulation to anticipate higher markets. In fact,
the rise in most articles has gone further than
speculative opinions warrant. Practically all
industries are some months b^iind the require
ments for actual use, and in âany much of
the output next year is already sold.
Iron works which supply Pittsburg are sold
up far Into 1900 and can do nothing, though
prices much beyond what they received are
paid by those who must have Iron this year.
, The enormous demand for luore railroads and
more rails and cars, more vessels, warehouses
and buildings to handle the extraordinary busi
ness in progress cannot be met as quickly as
men would like and work of all sorts is de
layed, from the biggest war vessel to the
smallest factory.
Western receipts of wheat no longer keep
up with the extraordinary movement a year
ago. falling 1,800,000 bushels behind for the
week, but in four weeks have been 15,367,414
bushels, against 14,354,621 last year. Atlantic
exports were slightly larger than last year,
and In four weeks 11,421,322 bushels, (lour in
cluded, against 11.737.255 last year, while Pa
cific exports have been 332.024 bushels for the
week and in four weeks 1,683,353, against 1.531,
--!'f.4 last year.
Failures for the week have been 163 in the
United States, against 179 last year, and 16
in Canada, against 26 last year.

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO. Aug. 25. â At the opening and for
a short time after wheat was influenced by
the strength of corn. Shorts were having a
big scramble In that pit, and their eagerness
to get under cover had some effect on shorts
in wheat. Longs were out of the market for
the time being, and prices advanced for both
September and December. December opened
unchanged at 73% c and advanced to 74@74<-hC.
September opened a shade higher at 1 7!V<
-71%c and advanced to 72c. The demand was
small, however, the news in general favor
ing the bears. A Belling movement set In at
the advance, which was almost entirely pro
fessional at first, but finally brought out
tide longs to the market and induced a
good deal of realizing, resulting In a
material decline nil around. The market be
came extremely dull, and after 11 o'clock prices
kept within a comparatively narrow range.
Hut with sentiment favoring the selling side,
the rallies were invariably followed by fresh'
attacks by the bears. ' Both domestic and for
eign crop news was favorable. Snow's crop
estimate gave the yield of Minnesota and
the Dakotas at about 175,000,000 bushels spring
wheat, and other reports indicated a better
condition of crops In the Northwest than has
been stated. The Roumania crop was also
said to be far better than previously reported.
The. cash situation, however, continued good
and this was a supporting factor to the mar
ket. The market was diligently hammered by
the bears during the last hour, but better sup
port materialized, and after September had de
clined to 71% c and December to 73% c the mar
ket became steadier. September reacted to 71%
(&71'ic and December to 73% c. These were
the closing figures.
There was a big trade in corn, especially in
September. Rumors were current of a squeeze
In that option, mid judging from the anxiety
of shorts to cover, had some foundation. Lead
ing commission houses were heavy buyers. The
excellent cash demand and moderate receipts
strength if .cd the situation. Distant futures
were firm with September, but did not hold
their strength. September closed â >Â«'</ higher,
December closing unchanged.
Oats in the main followed corn. The cov
ering movement In September corn caused like
action in September oats, and that future was
strong and higher most of the session. Sep
tember and December closed a shade higher.
Provisions were slow and practically feature
less. The general tone was steady, but with
out material changes in prices. Packers
bought sparingly of September ribs and lard
and reported a good Jobbing, trade. Selling
was' mostly from the outside. At the close
September pork was 2^c lower, lard unchanged
and ribs He higher.
The leading futures ranged as follows: ; >. .

Harrison's circular says: "During the week
there have been the following coal deliveries:
Three from Oregon, 1350 tons; three from Wash
â  â¢ ington. 5424 tons; one. from British Columbia,
] 40."0 tons; one from Australia. 2504 tons; totaL |
13,328 tons. The amount at hand this week is ;
less than one-half of our actual consumption j
and about one-third of the quantity received j
the week previous. There is no shrinkage of
the coal production of our northern collieries, j
the difficulty lies in securing carriers', and may j
prove a very serious barrier against our secur- |
ing a fuel sufficiency this winter, unless |
some steam colliers come to our rescue in Sep- i
temher or October. Some yards usually carry
a stock of 7000 to IÂ©,ooo tons this month and j
next to provide the trade with their require
i ments; at present they have not 10 per cent
of this amount, besides being largely in arrears
of their contracted deliveries. We cannot ex
pect any relief from foreign sources, when it
is known that there are only thirteen cargoes
that can possibly arrive here prior to Novem
ber next, aggregating about 33,000 tons, less i
than nine days' actual coal consumption."

THE STOCK MARKET.
Â* ; â ! â â¢â .'_-
Yesterday was a dull day in stocks, as the
military parade monopolized public attention.
The Bond Exchange held an afternoon call,
but there were no changes worthy of note.
The mining: stock boards also made a very
poor exhibit in the matter of business.
The telegram from the pump said: "At 8:30
this morning the water was 31 feet 6 inches
below the 1950 level station. No. 1 elevator
has been working continuously."
The Comstock Pumping Association has ap
proved the revised contract for electrical
power with the Truckee River Company. The
special committee reported in favor of the
contract except Mr. Ross, who handed In his
resignation as superintendent of the Pumping
Association. It was accepted and Joseph R.
Ryan was elected his successor.

JOHN DUTTON SUED
FOR HEAVY DAMAGES
OAKLAND. Aup. 23. â Ex-Sheriff Calvin

to-day against John W. Dutton. who was
a-deputy uncW him. and Thomas Prather,
ore o! button's liondsmon, for the recov
ery iâ { $2000 damages claimed to have be^n
"sustained by reason of an erroneous ser
vice of summons in the suit of J. B. Wai
]or against F. K. and Mai Ann Weston.
which was brought in Contra Costa
County in September of 1897. The Wa'
ler-Weston suit was for the foreclosure
of a mortgage for $S4ftf. together with $400
c-iunsel fet-s and costs. Judgment wad
secured and the property was subsequent
ly sold at public auction for JSOOO. Last
March, however, the WestODS discovered
grounds on whio-h they moved that .1: .

Dutton had served the complaint and
summons on C. K. V.'eston, a brother of
the defendant. The motion was accord
ingly granted on the condition that â 'â â¢
fendant pay to Waller $1W costs that thn
latter had liquidate. l. The case wax then
appealed to the Supreme Court and judg

By reason of Button's negligence

ex-Sheriff Whito has been put to a greit

UNION IRON
WORKS HAS A
SMALL STRIKE
Pattern- Makers Ask
Increased Wages.
Labor troubles, which for several
. en impending at the
Union iron Works, have culminated in a
strike, which while not general in its char
kssumes grave importance from the
itrikers are successful, as
assert they will be. behind

ent* of the bis institution may be

OAKLAND
SUFFER HAS
IDEAS ABOUT
TAX LEVYING
â . â
Will Oppose Schemes
of Mr. Miller.
BREED'S FIGURES ACCEPTED
COUNCIL AGREES IN NEARLY
EVERY DEPARTMENT.
May Make a Few Increases Next
Week, but Not Likely to Pass
a Levy That Will Exceed
the Dollar.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
SOS Broadway, Aug. 25.
Less than a thousand dollars will be the
difference between the estimate of City
Auditor Breed and of the City Council for
conducting the government for this fiscal
year. Mr. Breed's figures show some
heavy cutting from the estimates of the
heads of the various departments, but he
has so uniformly adjusted matters that
in order to carry out his financial scheme
it will require exactly a tax levy of $1,
which was promised by the party electing
Mr. Breed.
At the next meeting of the Council many
estimates now in abeyance will be finally
mined. The most Important item
w;ll be that of the Street Department, and
the recommendation of Mr. Miller, Street
Superintendent, will be considered. It is
difficult to see, in view of what the Coun
cil has already determined upon, how
12 additional cents or even 1 cent can be
added to the park and boulevard fund
without the Council violating its prom
ises made before election. Certainly the
Mayor will not approve of any ordinance
axing a tax levy of more than $1. It any
additional proportion of the levy is given
to the park and boulevard fund It will
have to come from some of the other
departments in order to keep the levy
down to its legal limit. As nearly all the
department estimates have been passed on
by the Council, it is not likely that they
will go over the ground again for the pur
pose of carrying out Mr. Miller's sugges
tion. It is the expressed intention of the
Council, having gone through all the fig
ures for the purpose of cutting them
down, to now go through them all for the
purpose of seeing where a raise can be
mafle to advantage.
Councilman Schaffer is strongly opposed
to Mr. Miller's schema of street improve
ment and has placed himself on record
in the following language:
"In reference to the 12 per cent addition
to the taxes proposed by the Street Super
intendent for the imorovement of Tele
graph avenue. I shall assuredly oppose
the step in the Council. My reason for
this opposition is this: The improvement
proposed is one that ought to be obtained
as Other public and general necessities
are obtained, such as water front im
provement, dredging and intercepting
tewers. .All those are public improve i
and at the same time public necessities. In
order to get them it will be necessary, as
the Mayor in his message has early
shown, to bond the city. It will be impos
sible to get them or any of them without
bonding the city.
"I realize that there are seven votes in
the City Council favoring certain im
provements, and they would probably pre
fer Mr. Miller's suggestions to the good,
common judgment of the Mayor and the
rest of the Council, I feel that the recom
mendations of the Mayor's message, if
they can be carried out, will be greatly
to the advantage of the city of Oakland
as an entirety, Including the annexed dis
trict.
"It seems to me that a few men in the
Council are advising Mr. Miller and that
their advice is not Bound. It only tends
to create more discord and friction in the
whole city government. Th.- whole time
of Mr. Miller and these advisers of his in
the Council is taken up with the effort to
hold Miller In office. Let them stop their
political bickering and apply themselves
to the public business, whether Miller is
In or out.
As for the suggestion of a Councilman
that to the victors belong the spoils my
motto instead of that would be 'To the
people of .Oakland belong all the energies
of a harmonious Council and city govern
ment, regardless of political affiliations
and interests.' "
STRUCK BY THE TRAIN

Celebration Notes
A I IMBDA, Aug. 25. â Alameda promises
to be thf- most deserted town on t:.-- coast
to-morrow evening, nearly the entire pop
ulation will be in Ban Francisco to sâ
the big parade. The merchants on Park
street together with those on Webster
str. <-\ have agreed to close up s>. p at
2 o'clock to-morrow afternoon in order to
give all hands a chance to enjoy th<
bration acn Be th< bay. The busii
of Bay street will also rinse at tha.l
â¢ yen a drug store will bÂ»- open In
A number of the merchants
groups outside of the gates and discussed
t he affair. Naturally when the matter
ti'-'amo generally known in the shops
there was more or less subdued ex â 
merit evinced by the men, but there were
no attempts .it violence, and the Btrikers
kept mainly to themselves, finally dispers
ing, the men going their several ways to
their homes.
The officers of the Union Iron Works
have been summoned to discuss the mat
ter, and after this meeting some ulti
matum may be iBSUed to the strikers. In
the meantime the latter will direct thi ir
efforts toward inducing the men who have
nfii y>.-t j"incil In the movemem to .
Immediately. They assert ;'.r,\\. they will
mereli seek to persuade them b> pointing
out thai the demands madi of the man
agement of the Union Iron Works are
just, and that no deeds of violence will be
countenanced. The leaders believe that
they will have the support of the various
associated iabnr bodies in this eitj in the
movement, and confidently declare that
ih^ men uf the several other de
partments of the iron works will lend
th^lr support to insure the puccrtis of the
strike should this become necessary.
The scale of wage." f'>r pattern makers
at the Union Iron Works has heen $3 2j
lâ¢ r day. The saint- rate formerly pr. -
vailed in the foundry. However, a few
weeks ago the foundrymen united in a de
mand for an Increase of 2~> cents per day.
At tirst the demand was refused, where
upon a strike was threatened. The man
agement of the iron works held out as
long as it could, and in every way possible
i to satisfy the men without in
creasing their wages. Finally, when they
became convinced that a strike really had
bees determined upon, t !;â¢â ;. capitulated
and the foundrymen gained their point.
But for a short while only did peace
prevail in the big institution. It was s.p..n
made known among the men that the
foundrymen had secured a raise of â¢â¢â -
This induced the pattern makers to '.â¢â¢ -
lieve that they too could be equally as
successful. Hence the strike that is now
111 progress.
Indications point to the conclusion that i

: the present struggle will be much more
Bharply waged and be much more pro
longed than was the fight instituted by
the foundrymen. The Bcotts have come
to realize that they are threatened with
a very grave danger. The ease with which
1 the fnundrymen gained their first struggle
has emboldened all of the men in the big
shops. At present there are about ">OOO
â¢ employed, and should they all join in a
movement for a demand of increased
wages the consequences would be grave
Indeed.
For several months past there has been
:. 1 disconteni among the men. even
Including the clerks, as to the wages.
Talks of strikes in various departments
have been frequent. Km until the foun
drymen took the initiative nothing defi
nite was done on the part of the men.
Even in the ease of the foundrymen mere
ly the threat of a strike was made. The
I men took the first step only.
The strike of the pattern makers was
set at a very opportune time from their
point of view. Just now the Union Iron
Works is rushed with work. In addition
to the two i'it- r battleships, the Ohio and
Wyoming, that are to be built by the
Union Iron Works, there are to be con
structed for the Government three tor
pedo boats. Th>- patterns for the machin
ery of these \arious vessels still remain
to be made, In addition to which the
, Scotts have contracts to construct the
new ferryboat for the Santa Ft Railway
1 Company and a steamer for the Hawaiian
trade. A strike just now. if of large pro
' portions or long continued, would serious
ly affect the institution. Besides this, the
' strikers claim that good mechanics are

T'nion Iron Works even now has difficulty

Butchers' Association
Will Also Parade.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Aug. 25.
Oakland has completed her preparations
for crossing the bay en masse to takÂ»
part in the welcome parade to-morrow
evening to the returned volunteers.
The order has gone forth that all busi
ness will be suspended at 4 o'clock to
morrow afternoon and after that hour the
policemen and a few stray owls will have
entire possession of this city. All over
town cards have been placed to-day in
store windows with the following inscrip
tion: "Trade early; we close at 4 p. m.
Saturday to join in the welcome to our
returned heroes."
The Merchants' . Exchange took this
matter in hand and after a few hours'
canvassing every store of importance had
agreed to obey the request to close early.'
The Journeymen Butchers held a con
ference last night and decided that all
the meal markets in this city shall close
at the same hour as otner stores to
morrow afternoon. The butchers will be
escorted by the Fifth Regiment Band a.nd
will parade In white caps and white
gowns. All butchers will meet at their
hall, 91S Washington street, at 5 o'clock
and will proceed to San Francisco to take
part in the parade.
Mayor Snow and nearly all the city
officials have expressed their intention of
attending in carriages and have been as
signed places in' the parade. Yesterday
the railroad agents assert that 45,000 peo
ple crossed the bay from Oakland. To
day the number wf<s not so great, but
to-morrow it is believed i?,at fully 60,000
people rum this county will cross to San
Francisco to witness the night pageantry
and electrical display.
The ferry stem has been thoroughly
demoralized for the past two days, me
railroad company being utterly unable to
cope with the situation. Yesterday and
to-day, during certain hours, trains and
boats" ran haphazard, and occasional.
more than an hour would be consumed
in crossing the bay. Last night passen
gers who left Broadway at 9 o'clock die]
not reach the city until 10:20, which is
twice the time usually occupied. Although
all trains and boats have been crowded
to the! 1 utmost capacity yet not a single
accident of any kind has occurred on this
side i-f the bay.
All Grand Army men and old soldiers
of Alameda County are invited to meet
at the City Hall promptly at 4:15 p. m.
to-morrow to . fall in with Company A,
Veteran Reserves, of Oakland, Captain C.
K. King commanding, and take part In
the. parade in iionor of the home-coming
of the California Volunteers. The Mayor
and city officials will also be escorted by
the Veteran Reserves, a place in ue
fourth division has been assigned to Oak
land.
Next Tuesday evening the veterans and
ladies of Lyons and Appomattox Relief
Corps will tender a reception and banquet
to the soldiers who have returned from
Manila and who reside in this county,
The boys will be welcomed by Hon. Mayor

WIFE STEALING
NOT ADVISABLE

John Raven Is Found
Not Guilty.
HE THREATENED HIS LODGER
HIS WIFE NOW SEEKING A
SEPARATION.
Coal Workers Advocate Bullets for
Men Who Lead Their Friends'
Wives Astray â Tragedy
Daily Expected.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Aug. 25.
It is not a crime in the jurisprudence of
the mining town of Tesla for one man to
threaten the life of another when such
threats are induced by the stealing of a
wife's affections
John Raven has been acquitted for the
charge of threatening the life of Antone
Hartman, but it is likely that more will
be heard of the incident, as Mrs. Raven
has flown from the. Raven nest and has
applied for a divorce.
During tht- examination the little story
underlying Ravens desire to decrease the
inhabitants of the mining town by one,
concerned Antone Hartman, a friend
\\h.,m Raven hud boarded at his h
and Raven's wife. Soon after Hartman
commenced to live with the Ravens
â¢ T'lakings were heard between Mr. and
Mrs. Raven. Raven thought that Hart
man was altogether too attentive and ef
fusive in his behavior toward th.- hostess,
and while satisfying himself on this point
Raven became convinced that these atten
tions were not only acceptable, but were
reciprocated.
Hartman and Raven are expert miners.
A few days ago they met in the coal mines
and Raven suggested to Hartrnan that it
would he a good thing to seek lodgings
elsewhere, for if he entered the Raven
nest again there might be a tragedy.
Hartman did not take kindly to Raven's
advice, and the testimony showed thai he
was so angry that he cut up a window
screen in the home "f the Ravens and is
now under arrest for malicious mischief.
This arrest led to more quarreling, and
finally Raven repeated his suggestion as
to how Hartman could avoid dying an
early death. All the sentiment at the
mini's was in favor of Raven, and sony
of the miners who were witnesses in the
case assorted that in their opinion a man
should promptly shoot any other man
who destroyed his domestic happiness, in-
Btead of wasting threats upon him.
The magistrate declined to hold Raven
on the charge made by Hartman. Mrs.
Raven has packed up her personal i>< -
ngs ana left home to obtain a di
vorce. The people in the mining town are
living in hourly expectation of something
occurring, when Haven and Hartman
have their next quarrel.
The divorce case of the Ravens is a
I edition or a divorce case tiled some
time ago by Mrs. I'lkeii, also of Tesla.
in this case" the husband believed he had
cause to be jealous of a fellow miner, and
made life so miserable fur his wife that
she was forced to seek a separation.
Annie Skinner also hied suit to-day tor
a divorce from William Juseph Skinner,
alleging statut< ry grounds.
In the divorce case of H. J. V. Merle
against Florence R. Merle, default of de
fendant for failure to appear or answer
was entered to-day. The plaintiff was
formerly a motorman on the Alameda
electric railway, and he alleges that his
wife deserted him for another about a
year ago.

divorce from Elizabeth Johnson by J
Greene to-day on the ground of Infidelity.

YEARS IN ROMAN NUMERALS.
Only Three Letters Will Be Required
Next Year.
"H.ive you noticed." said the pale math
ematician, "how much easier i: is going
to be, after this year, to write the num
ber of the year in Roman numerals?"
"What do I want ta write the year in
Roman numerals for?" said the ruddy
business man.
"Maybe you don't." the pale mathema
tician answered, "but notice the differ
ence. Tn Arabtc figures U ha 3 taken just
four figures to write the number of th<Â»
year ever since tne year l*)Â»> . and it will
take no more till the- year 999 ft. But in Ro
man numerals the year IflOO was\wricten
with a single letter 'jrl.' We shaH never
FÂ»t back to one letter aguin. Now for

EXTRA SESSION
IS THE TALK
OF POLITICIANS
Caucus Pledge May
Be a Myth.
WILD RUMORS CIRCULATED
HUNTINGTON MAY PULL BURNS
OUT OF THE CONTEST.
Legislators Who Opposed the Mexi
can Have Not Changed Their
Views Since the Last
Ballot.
The multitude of visitors In San
Francisco embrace many members of
the Legislature and well-known poli
ticians from interior counties and the
southern region of the State. Aboard
| the steamship Santa Rosa day before
rday, when tho Senators and As
semblymen were the guests of the
Han Francisco delegation in the Legis
j lature, extra session was a topic fre
quently discussed. It was noted that
Speaker AJden Anderson, one of the
I leaders of Genera] Barnes' Senatorial
I column, was on deck. Senator Cutter,
I the foremost man of Grant's band,
â and Judge Dibble of the Hums follow
â  ing were also in the throng. Demo
crats as well as Republicans expressed
the opinion that the Governor would
call an extra session of the Legislature.
All sorts of rumors were circulated re
garding: a signed paper, btit no member
of the Legislature could be found who
would admit that he had seen a caucus
pledge with signatures attached
thereto.
The story was told that Assembly
man Huber of Pomona had changed
his mind and would agree to a caucus
proposition. The same was said of
[ Assemblyman Merritt of Santa Bar
bara and Assemblyman Works of San
Diego. Assemblyman Lardher of
Placer was also counted as an extra
session advocate who had signified a
readiness to settle in caucus the ques
tion of the Senatorship. No one would
actually vouch for the accuracy of the
MOST SUCCESSFUL OF
THEATRICAL MANAGERS
J HARRY RICKARDS of the Sydney, N. S. W., Tivoli, Here. J
? T T ARRY RICKARDS, one of the best known theatrical managers in Aus-
j^ I â l tralia. arrived from Sydney, N. S. W., on the steamer Alameda yester-
jp I day. Mr. Rickards is accompanied by his wife and two daughters, and
Mr. Marcus, his private secretary. Mr. Rickards will remain some Â±
j^ time in San Francisco, and during his stay will engage quite a number
+ of variety artists for his theaters in Australia. His patrons want the very y.
-j< best in the business and they get it.
.fc The Tivoli Theater in Sydney and the Bijou and Gaiety In Melbourne +
-ft are all owned and managed by Mr. Rickards. The majority of his artists â +
+ usually came from England, but having decided upon a change, the voyage 34
--* to the T'nited States was undertaken in order to procure talent. *â 
+ From here the Rickards party will go to Denver, Chicago, Philadelphia, jj.
Boston and New York, and in all of these places a lookout will be kept for y^.
"stars." After doing the United States, England, France and Germany will jf
be visited, and then about the beginning of next year Mr. Rickards expects jf
to reach Australia again. jf.
"I have not been very well for some time past," said Mr. Rickards yes- 34.
terday, "so I made up my mind to make a tour of the world and mci- >f
dentajly pick up attractions on my way. "With the Tivoli in Sydney I have jf
been connected for years, and it was there I gained my first success as a jf.
manager. It is not like your Tivoli, but Is more on the lines of the Orpheum. jf
Some of the people who played in my houses came on to San Francisco and jf
made successes at the Orpheum hero. During my tour I expect to make *.
jj enough contracts to keep my theaters going for a year to come." Jf
Mr. Rickards and his family are staying at the California Hotel. *
statements, but all seemed to be con
vinced that the members would be
convened in special session early in
November.
The members of the Legislature who
opposed Burns at the regular session
last winter and were never deceived by
the Mexicans" boast of reserved
strength, are still confident that he
cannot win, with or without a caucus.
The Barnes men. Grant's followers
and Scott's supporters still adhere to
I the judgment that a vacancy in the
United States Senate would be more
creditable t . . California than the pres
ence of Burns in that body as a repre
sentative of the State.
Yesterday afternoon at the Palace
court a prominent ex-Senator and a
well-known Senator each wagered a
hat with the other that he could name
the United States Senator if the extra
j session were called. The proposition
was accepted, and both men wrote the
! name of Irving M. Scott. There is an
undercurrent of opinion that Hunting
ton has resolved to pull Burns out of
the contest. Many of th<> politicians
predict that the Governor will aban
don the whole extra-session scheme un
less a direct pledge to elect Burns is
signed by sixty-one members.
Among the members of the Legisla
ture who were here yesterday were
Senators Flint. La Rue. Luchsinger.
("utter, Shortridge, Boyce, Dickinson
and Leavitt, and Assemblymen Bel
shaw, Anderson. Merritt. Lardner, Ath

RAN A MILLION
MILES WITHOUT
ANY BREAKDOWN
Splendid Record of the
Alameda.
HER SIXTIETH VOYAGE ENDED
IS AS GOOD NOW AS THE DAY
SHE WAS LAUNCHED.
Two Steamer Men Injuredâ Scurvy

ward Bound â Big Kaft
Off Port.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's mail
steamer Alameda completed her sixtieth
round trip to Australia yesterday. She
was a few hours behind time through
having to buck a strong head wind all
the way across the Pacific.
Before going on the Australian run
the Alameda made twenty-five round trips
to Honolulu. In all her journeyings from
the time she left the Cramps' yards at
Philadelphia the Alameda has run over
a million miles, and during the sixteen
years it took her to cover that distance
she was not stopped at sea ten hours, all
told, for repairs. She has never been late,
but frequently ahead of time, and there
has never been an occasion when her mall
failed to overland on schedule time. This
is a record that very few steamers afloat
can approach, and is jl great leather in
the cap of American ship builders.
Ol the snip s crew that left Â± J niiadelphia
in ihe Alaineua, only one remains, he is
a D. Little, the chief engineer, ana ne i
says the vessel is as good to-day as when
she came around the Horn in tne record
breaking run of forty-live days. O. N.
Clark, tne chief steward) has been httt-en
years on the Alameda, and Airs. Uranam,
the stewardess, thirteen years. All the.
other members of the crew joined the yes- \
feel at later dates. Clark was the Mrst
American that ever went to Australia as
Chief steward of an American steamer.
He was on the old suit wheel steamer Ne
vada in I*7l, when she carried the "mail
between Honolulu, Auckland and Sydney.
In that ytar and also during IST2-7:! the
Mohonga. Moses Taylor, Montana and
Beveral other steamers carried the mail
to Honolulu and there it was transferred
to the Nevada, Nebraska and Dakota,
Which steamers carried it on to the colo
nies. After the old-timers had served
their turn the Oceanic Steamship Com
pany came into existence and the Ala
mi da and Mariposa were built. These tine
vessels have In turn grown too small for
the trade, and in conseauenct three fine j
(JOW-tun vessels are now in course of con
struction for the company at Philadelphia
by the Cramps, the builders of the Ala
meda.
The Alameda brought over a big crowd
of passi liters many ot whom are theatri
cal people. The Maggie Moore-Roberts
Company stopped off at Honolulu and
after playing an engagement there will
come on to San Francisco on the Austra
lia. "The Belle of New York" company
came back home minus one of its iiura
ber. \V. Gerard died in Sydney of con-
Bumptlon. His widow came back on the
steamer. Mr. and Mrs. Coventry of tho
â¢'Trip u> Chinatown" company also came
back on the Bt< ami r.
Captain Van oterendorp reports that
while the Alameda was in Apia harbor
the Government steamer Abarindo, from
Norfolk, Va.. arrived with supplies for
the naval station at Pago Pago. She also
had the material for the new wharf, so
Healy, Tibbitts & Co., the contractors,
will be able to begin work at once.
Charles Elliott, the British Commission
er to the Samoan conference, came back
on the Alameda. He went to New Zea
land to visit his sister, and joined the
steamer at Auckland. Lieutenant Com
mander Guttner of the German gunboat
Cormorant and James If. Mulligan, ex-
I'nited States Consul General to Samoa,
were also passengers. Mr. Mulligan has
bf( n to Apia adjusting claims for dam
ages done during the bombardments of
Apia and the native villages.
Lieutenant Philip Andrews of the Pen
sacola and his bride were passengers from
Honolulu. Lieutenant Andrews and Miss
Fuller were married as soon as the Mari
posa reached Hawaii on her southward
trip. The happy couple will make their
home in Oakland.
The tugs Relief and Rescue are outside
â¢with the big raft they towed down from
the Columbia. River. Wind and tide wore
against the towboats when they reached
the bur. so they stayed outside all night.
The barkentlne Monitor started for Eu
reka yesterday, but sprang a leak off the
lightship and had to put hack.
George Butler, a deckhand on the
steamer J. D. Peters, fell from the hurri
cane dt-ck to the main deck yesterday and
broke his left leg. He was treated at the
Harbor Hospital by Dr. Rice.
The steamer Grace Barton arrived from
Potaluma yesterday with thirty-three
head of consumptive cows. Health Offi
cer Lawlor examined the cattle and at
once condemned them. The animals were
in the last stages of tho disease. They
will be slaughtered to-day and the meat
destroyed.
F. Harris and his brother Sabin were
passengers for Stockton on the steamer
J. D. Peters yesterday. Both men are
suffering from scurvy contracted in
Kotzehue Sound and are going Into the
country to recuperate. Sabin Harris Sr.
went up to the supposed gold fields with
his sons, but he died on the Kowak River
of henrt failure. The Harris brothers
were brought from Kotzebue to Cape
Nome by the revenue cutter Bear, and
from Cape Nome they came to San Fran
cisco on the Portland. They have not
much faith in the Cape Nome diggings,
as they think everything is being held
for speculating purposes.

Hermit's Feat in Quest

Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA. B. C, Aug. 25.â Among the
recent arrivals from the north Is Bertram
Tennyson of London, England, a nephew
of the late Lord Alfred Tennyson. He re
turned last night from the Cassiar coun
j try, where he has been, in his capacity
as mining expert, investigating various
properties in Cassiar. in the vicinity of
Dease Lake, in the interest of a British
syndicate.
Mr. Tennyson tells of meeting some
strange characters in the north. When he
was journeying out he came across a her

is a hermit and will converse with no one.
Investigations made by Tennyson, who
was curious to l.am more of the hermit
miner, showed that he had tunneled his
property to the length of 2o(K> feet. He has
very rich dirt and is taking considerable
gold out of his deep tunnel. Three big
boxes of dust were said to be buried be
neath the shack in which the hermit lives.
Tennyson learned from others in the vi
cinity that the miner went down to \ic- ,
i toria every two or three years, and while i
' in the city spent money freely for a few ,
1 months. He would throw his money away |
, right and left, and then when his funds
were exhausted would go to his northern
mine and to his hermit life, which he lived
until he got another well filled sack, then
another visit was paid to civilization, and
I for a time the hermit became the sport.
