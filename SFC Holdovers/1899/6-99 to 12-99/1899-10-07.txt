JOHN MORLEY USES
SOME VERY PLAIN WORDS
LONDON, Oct. fi.â Addressing a peace
meeting at Carnarvon this evening John
Morlej asked the country to. realize the
which it had been brought
by unhappy diplomacy and the Bedlamite
counsels of the war press and the war
party.
"If." said Mr. Morley, "President Kru
ger had accepted the franchise proposal
of September 8, with rollance upon the
convention of 1884, )-.-â  would have been
planted behind diplomatic intrenchments,
which by fair and reasonable means
couid not have been for I. Even after
thai refusal there was still room for a
friendly settlement, but just as the
Transvaal made a mistake our Govern
ment capped ft by withdrawing the fran
chise proposals."
Mr. Morley dwelt upon the moderation
and reasonableness '.f t!:.- recent sp< â¢â â !!
of the Duke <>f Oevonshlre, winch proved
that Great Britain did not desire to in
terfere with the Transvaal's independ
ence. The speaker said he had always
pressed the urgency of the Transvaal's
meeting Great Britain half way. He re
gretted the withdrawal of the five years'
franchise, bitt condemned <;r<'i? Britain
fi r now abandoning the franchise which
had hitherto been the foundation of the
Government policy. He dilated upon the
eventual danger of having at the back of
a strategic posl like the Cape a disaf
fected pi pulation held down by force of
arms, and said he f.ii!< -d to sec why the
Transvaal and Great Britain were unable
to come to terms. Mr. Morley spoke deri
sively of the talk of a pan-Afrikander
conspiracy in South Africa.
DUTY OF HOLLAND
TOWARD THE DUTCH
BRUSSELS, Oct. 6.â Some sensation has
been caused in the Netherlands by the
publication of a pamphlet entitled "The
Duty of Holland Toward the Dutch." This
pamphlet, which is written by a promi
nent leader of tho Liberal party, Mr. Van
Houten, asserts that it is the strict duty
of the Dutch Government to interfere
diplomatically in favor of the South Af
rican Dutch republic. He goes to show
that if Queen Wilhelmina's Ministers do
not address foreign powers in order to
bring about their peaceful mediation, In
pursuance of the decisions of The Hague
Peace Conference, they will be committing
a real crime against the Dutch fatherland
Itself; for what threatens the Boers to
day may threaten the Netherlands to
morrow.
It is rumored that Queen "Wilholmlna,
who Is on the point of starting for Ger

the child of the Prince of Wled, has been
urged by some of her counselors to men

William.
FAVORS A REVISION
OF MARITIME LAWS
Testimony of a Ship Broker Before
the Industrial Commission in
Washington.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 6.â Frank L. Neall
of the firm of Peter Wright & Sons of
Philadelphia and N. B. Kelley, secretary
of the Trades League of Philadelphia,
were the witnesses before the Industrial
Commission to-day.
Mr. Neall is a shlpbroker. and his testi
mony dealt with the subject of marine
transportation almost exclusively. He
stated that since the Transvaal question
had become acute Great Britain had taken
at least seventy-flve vessels that were or-
I dlnarily engaged in the foreign carrying
trade of the United States. The result
naturally had been a very marked ad
vance in freight rates, and Mr. Neall de
i clared that the tonnage of American ves
j sels available for ocean traffic did not ex
ceed 300,000, whereas the total tonnage of
i the vessels of the world was 25,000.000. He
I favored a revision of the maritime laws
i of this country so as to permit the pur-
I chase of foreign-built .freight steamers
j for miscellaneous transoceanic business,
i commonly known as tramps. These . yes
â  sols- 'null "be built one-fourth cheaper
abroad than in this country, and wher
ever owned they had proved very profit
able. Within the past two years the prac
tice of leasing such vessels by Americans,
he said, had increased fourfold, and after
paying a profit to the lessees they were
; netting their owners 20 and 25 per cent
per annum. Mr. Neall announced himself
as opposed to a discriminating duty for
i the benefit of American ships built, for
the reason that he believed that such a
system would precipitate retaliatory
. measures on the par) or the other na
tions. In reply to a question he said there
was not a single line of steamers crossing
] the Atlantic that is composed entirely of
American vessels.
Mr. Kelley explained the purpose of the
Philadelphia Trades League to be to pro
tect the shippers of that city against rail
road discrimination. One of the discrim
inations which grave the league most
trouble was found in the misdescrlption
of goods. He announced himself favor
able to pooling by railroads, and assented
to a proposition by Commissioner Far
riuhar that competition is the parent of
discrimination. He would give the Inter
state Commerce Commission authority to
revise rates and otherwise enlarge its
powers.
HELEN GOULD'S VOICE
RAISED AGAINST ROBERTS
Causes Vigorous Resolutions to be
Adopted by the Guardian
Society.
NEW YORK. Oct. (>.â At the meeting
to-day of the American Female Guardian
Society the following resolutions were
read hy Miss Helen M. Gould and unani
mously adopted:
"Whereas, Brigham H. Roberts, who
has been elected n Representative from
tJtali tn the Fifty-sixth Congress is a
polygamist and as surh is attacking the
Band it v ''1" home life,
"Resolved, That wo, the women assem
bled at the call of the American Female
Quardlan Society and Home for the
Friendless, do earnestly protest against
th.- seating of Mr. Roberts, and
"Resolved, That we urge that all men
and women use their influence with their
respective Congressmen to prevent said
Roberts taking his seat."
A number of addresses in opposition to
the seating of Mr. Roberts were made.
Miss Gould did not speak, but at the con
clusion of the meeting she handed the re
porters a statement signed H. M. Gould.
The statement follows:
"I am glad to have an opportunity to
protest against the seating in Congress of
a man who advoHtes and practices
polygamy. Our country has been noted in
the past for the beauty of its homo life
and the chivalry and respect shown by
man to woman. It would be sad indeed
to see a -nan who stands for the oriental
harem seated among out lawmakers. I
earnestly hone that men will feel will
ing to write their Congressmen urging
them to rise in protest against Mr. Rob
erts being seated when Congress opens."
DROVE A HATPIN
INTO HER STOMACH
Polish Woman at Olympia Makes a
Desperate Attempt at Sui
cide.
SEATTLE, Oct. 6.â A special to the
Post-Intelligencer from Olympia says: A
most deliberate and barbarous attempt at
suicide occurred at Bucoda yesterday.
Mrs. Loo Prabuski, a Polish woman, bo
came angered at some little domestic oc
currence and determined to do away with
her life. She procured an ordinary hai
pin six Inches long and drove it into her
stomach through the navel.
Pressing hard against the pin she drove
it until it could go no further, as it had
lodged in the spine. Then with the inten
tion of forcing the pin out at the back
she procured a. rusty darning needle and
drove this into what she thought was the
hole made by th/ 3 hatpin. Not until 12
o'clock last night did she tell any one
what she had done.
To-day Mrs. Prabuski repented of her
act and accompanied the Bucoda physi
cian to this city, when Dr. Red path "re
moved the pin and needle. Dr. Redpath
thinks she will live. She is 48 years old
and has had nineteen children, five of
whom are living.

NOW COMES THIRD
ATTEMPT TO RACE
Cup Challenger Shamrock and Cud
Defender Columbia Ready to
Resume the Contest for
SuDremacij.
NEW YORK, Oct. 7â4:30 A. M.â Under the same
conditions that governed the failures of Tuesday
and Thursday the Columbia and Shamrock will to
day n)aKe a third attempt to complete the course of
fifteen rTjilesjto windward or leeward and return.
The wind is now north-northwest with a heavy sea
running. The indications are that there will be a
fresh wind at the commencement of the race; also a
heavy sea, but that the sea will go down as the race
proceeds.
NEW YORK, Oct. 6.â This has been a
day of rest on board the interna
tional racers. The Columbia was
towed from Sandy Hook to Bay
Ridge to get her out of any danger from
the northeaster. The Shamrock remained
at her anchorage at the Hook, her people
seeming willing to take the chances. The
wind blew up pretty fresh about 6 o'clock,
but there was nothing to threaten harm
to a yacht so well protected by tenders
and tugs, to say nothing of the powerful
Krin.
The feeling on both sides is one of con
fidence. Mr. Iselin thinks he will win.
Sir Thomas Lipton has a nice little corner
in the Erin all ready for the cup. The
public is in doubt, and it must be said
that there is a feeling of indecision among
the expert yachtsmen. The two days of
drifting have furnished almost nothing
on which to base opinions. They have,
however, seemed to strengthen the belief
that the Shamrock is a thoroughly dan
gerous proposition. This is now a well
grounded opinion, and if the two days of
light airs have done anything they have I
shaken that confident feeling that has
prevailed among the backers of the Co- i
lumbia. Those who have watched most
closely every movement of the two yachts
are firm in the belief that there is little
to choose between them in a drift, .and ;
as it is remembered that the Shamrock
people have never asserted that she was
a drifter it can be understood that there
is reason for a rise In the Shamrock stock.
Twice in the two days of racing there
have been times when both boats were
sailing under exactly similar conditions
for an hour after the start on Tuesday j
[and for a like length of time after -the j
! start on Thursday. ' ' Both were sailing \
dead before a light wind. -With the same
spread of canvas. On Tuesday the Sham- (
rock drew away from the Columbia. On
Thursday the Columbia drew away from i
the Shamrock. No one can draw lines on j
the racers from this, and it can safely be j
said that the only change that has taken |
place in the opinion of yachtsmen is one
that tends to Increase the doubt.
With her great mainsail snugly stowed
on the boom under a waterproof cover
the yacht Columbia lay at anchor off the
Sea Beach pier at Bay Ridge to-day, rid
ing out the easterly storm under the lee
of the land. All her other sails were un
bent and stowed below, where they will
be kept dry until needed. Should there
be rain and a strong breeze, however, the
sails will not be spared to-morrow, for
rain or shine, barring accidents, the
yachts will start in their race and make
a third attempt to complete the course
of fifteen miles, to windward or leeward
and back.
When interviewed on board the tender
St. Michaels to-day. C. Oliver Iselin, the
Columbia's managing owner, said:
"We know practically nothing more of
the merits of the boats than we did .on
Tuesday. If anything, we know less, for
we did not turn the outer mark this time,
but I have every confidence in the Colum
bia's ability to" outsail the Shamrock on
all points when we get a steady breeze.
That's what we wantâ wind."
Of yesterday's race Mr. Iselin added:
"When we made that last turn we were
not able to cross the Shamrock's bow, but
in all the windward work of yesterday
there was very little difference in the sail
ing of the yachts. We were In the best
position most of the time, and the Sham
rock was only a few yards ahead when
the race was called off."
Mr. Iselin said the same guests would
be on board the Columbia in to-morrow's
race as were there on previous days.
At sundown the wind jumped around to
the westward of north and blew great
guns for awhile. Captain Barr housed the
Columbia's topmast at once, gave the
yacht fifteen fathoms more cable, and
made preparations for letting go the sec
ond anchor. The weather looked decid
edly dirty from the sailor man's stand
point, so enough of the crew were kept
on board to take care of her In any emer
gency. As she is lying In a berth, with a
shore under her lee, if she should part her
cable in the night or drag her anchor dur
ing the night some quick work would be
necessary to save her from going on the
beach or smashing against the Sea. Beach
piers. Â»Â«./-<
The early rising sailor men of the Co
lumbia heard the whimpering of the wind
at the Hook to-day and they saw In the
rainstorm the prospect of a real day's
rest. They needed it, too, for while the
easy lolling excursion crowds who watch
ed the race figured that the sailors must
be working easier than any men they
ever saw, the fact was that the crew,
to a man, worked three times as hard
as if a genuine race had been sailed.
Eight times the spinnaker was sot and
taken in, while the stowing of ballooners
and topsails was a most momentous oc
casion. When the men turned out to
day they found that their spell of rest
was to he very near a reality
Mr. Iselin decided, for one thing, that
it" would be good to move up to Bay
Ridge. There was a look in the sky
which hinted that some other anchorage
might be better, so the consort was call
ed ahead and a little after 9 o'clock the
tow began. The Columbia was jogged
along easily, like a racer down from the
line. Two coastwise steamers passed her
and the little clusters of storm-clad
passengers gave her a cheer. A little
under two hours from the time she left
her anchorage inside the Horseshoe, the
Columbia was anchored off Bay Ridge.
The wind seemed to have an extra jam
in it then and so after making fast to the
buoy, the anchor was got over as well.
Snugged down at last, the only work of
the day for the white jacketed crew was
done. This was the inspection of the
racer. Aloft and below the Deer Island
men climbed and worked. Every part
had to stand ' inspection. Small chance
there was/ indeed, of any strain haviae
P 111 CE T4^iL^Cg2O^
NEW YORK, Oct. -Afloat
and ashore to-day little else
was talked about than the
failure of the Columbia and
Shamrock to have wind
enough for a race on Thurs
day, and the success of the Mar
coni system of wireless teleg
raphy. Only for wireless teleg
raphy news of Thursday's con
test between the yachts would have
been lacking untiL the return of
the excursion boats. Of this every
one is convinced. Discussing this
phase of the situation to-day the
Evening Post made these editorial
remarks:
"Yesterday's attempt at yacht
racing was again a failure, but the
telegraphic reports of it were a
tremendous success. In fact, the
yachts disappeared in a haze, but
observers on shore had to report
something, and so they proceeded
to draw freely on their imagina
tion. The result was the most
â¢rous bulletins conceivable.
tip to 3 o'clock we had the racers
only five miles or ho from the fin
ish, with a race certain, and then
suddenly came the cheerful an
nouncement that the yachts had
never even reached the outer
ptakeboat. It was not much, con
sidered as racing, but as reporting
It was truly wonderful. Simply
because the Herald saw fit to make
use of Signor Marconi's invention
the press of the city generally has
sulked, refusing to give the new
departure that credit which will in
a short time be forced.*
The Tribune and Times, however,
have been exceptions. The former
had this to say this morning:
"Sigrnor Marconi again proved the
efficiency and practicability of
wireless telegraphy by dispatching
from the vessel upward of 1000
words concerning the yacht race,
besides a number of private mes
sages, and receiving stock quota
tions and dispatches to individuals
on board without a hitch."
Somewhat fatigued by the labor
and worry of the last fortnight,
Signor Marconi rested to-day, see
ms his most intimate friends.
To-morrow he will again be on the
Ponce and the Herald and The Call
will be kept informed of the race
to the minute. There can be no
failure. Communication will prac
tically be direct with the Herald
office, there being: only one relay,
that of Navesink Highlands, which
consumes an average of less than
ten seconds. From the Grande
Duchesse W. J. Clarke will also

Bennelt cable ship.

i whitecapped waves off the Horseshoe,
watched anxiously from the deck of the
Erin by Sir Thomas Upton and his
i guests. The only sign of life upon the
! deck was a sturdy sailor clad in oilskins,
! pacing back and forth, keeping watch.
When Sir Thomas was told the Columbia
! had departed for a more sheltered an
i chorage he asked laughingly if the Amer
j lean beauty could not stand the wind and
weather as well as the Shamrock.
Nothing whatever has been done to the
Shamrock since yesterday's race, as the
light airs which floated across the water
i could not have broken a linen thread, and
I the overhauling of the rigging and the
I halyards was dispensed with. Everything

issue. She is in perfect condition for to
morrow's race, and the last move to in
sure a victory was taken this morning,
when the entire crew, including both
skippers of the challenger, had their hair
cut short, in order, as Sir Charles Rus
sell, a guest of Sir Thomas, remarked,
; that there would be no extra weight on
board. The third set of spreaders, which
were put In position about five minutes
] before Thursday's race, have been re
moved, and in all probability will not be
used at all, as they are deemed unneces
sary and were not even tried in the last.
race.
I Sir Thomas Lipton expressly stated,
when questioned on the subject, that Cap
taii Ben Parker, skipper of the German
Emperor's yacht Meteor, was on board
! the Shamrock pimply as a guest and friend
of Skippers Hogarth and Wringe, and
that, notwithstanding all reports to the
contrary, he took no part at all In sailing
the Shamrock In yesterday's race.
Sir Thomas stated that the Shamrock
had proved herself to be. an excellent
drifter and that he was very much
pleased with her performances In light
airs. He said the challenger was at some?
what of a disadvantage and that she'
could not command the services of Mr.
Fife, who designed her, and who is still
confined within doors by his rheumatism,
while Mr. Herreaboff was always on
hand to give advice and oversee any alter

LANDS IN TEXAS WERE
UNLAWFULLY OCCUPIED
Attorney General Filing Suits Agains
Stockmen for Thousands of Dollars
in Back Rentals.
0 AUSTIN, Oct. 6.â The investigation recently begun by the two State land (
O agents who were appointed two months ago on authority of the Legislature <
** reveals that not less than 18,000,0 if State land are being unlawfully j
i coupled by stockmen in West Texas. A number of suits have already been j
y instituted by the Attorney General against these unlawful occupants for re- â 
'S covery of back rentals. The total number of suits yet to be filed aggre- <
O gates over 400. <
It Is estimated that the State will derive a total of revenue from these j
Â§back rentals as a result of these suits of not less than 1600,000. These State j
lands have been unlawfully fenced and occupied by stockmen, who have j
â¢ been grazing their thousands of head of cattle thereon for many years with- â 
5 the State a cent of lease money. The money derived from these \
â¢ back rentals will be applied to the State permanent school fund.
to carry the cup across the ocean, the j
American yacht which would go across to |
win back the cup would be at as much ;
disadvantage as the Shamrock is over
here. He paid they rarely or never had |
the light breezes over there or the calm
seas which have characterized the first
two attempts at races on this side, and
that a yacht built for such light airs
would stand little chance abroad, where
the breezes were heavier and the seas
more boisterous.
It Is evident that Sir Thomas and his
friends are modestly confident that the
Shamrock will make an exceedingly good
showing against the Columbia in a breeze
and are greatly pleased at her good per
formances in the light weather hitherto
prevailing.
Sir Thomas smiled when he was told j
that the forecast for to-morrow promised j
a fair day and plenty of wind and Bald j
that such a day as to-day, without the |
rain, was what he was longing for. Among i

McKINLEY DEDICATES
A MONUMENT TO SOLDIERS
Most Interesting Ceremonies Occur at Peoria During
the President's Western Tour*
PEORIA, 111.. Oct. 6 - A good part of ;
the population of Peoria, the sec- '
"nd city of Illinois, to-day took j
part In an elaborate demonstration (
to welcome to their city the Presi- |
dent of the United States. The |
| great event of the day was the unveiling !
of a beautiful monument erected by I
Peoria's citizens, as a memorial to the sol- I
diers of the Rebellion, living and dead. \
| The monument is a tall shaft of marble i
ornamented at the base with bronze
groups commemorating scenes of the j
Civil War. It Is erected on an elevation '
: In front of the Courthouse, and by Its j
base had been constructed a platform i
i upon which the President and the mem- i
i bers of his party took seats to review a i
i long procession of militia, veterans of the i
! war and returning volunteers from the !
Spanish war. The concourse of people !
surrounding this platform and pack
ing every street in its vicinity was by far
the largest which has thus far greeted
the President on his Western tour. After
his review of the parade the President
took his seat facing the veiled monu- i
ment, by the side of Hon. Martin Kins
man, chairman of the exert
The monument was unveiled by S. A.
Kinsey, who has been chairman of th>
monument committee since its in
ception in 1883. A great cheer
burst from the multitude as the !
folds of canvas fell away from the J
shaft. The President, leaning on the
arm of Mr. Klhgman, and followed by |
the Cabinet officers, made a tour of the
open space surrounding the monument. In- :

the press of time did not allow more than
an infinitesimal portion of the surging
crowd to be presented to him,. The party I
was next driven to the Corn Palace, a
building wholly constructed of corn, j
where the Peoria corn festival was in
augurated by t' n >- President. An informal

EUROPE'S POSTAL
SYSTEM STUDIED
Congressman Loud Back
in New York.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Oct. 6.â Congressman
Eugene F. Loud, chairman of the House
Committee on Posuoffices and Post Roads,
and Superintendent Victor J. Bradley of
the Railway Mall Service, who have just I
completed a six weeks' tour investigating |
the workings of the postal systems of
! Great Britain, France and Germany, are
! busy compiling a report of their observa
i lions. The principal object of the excur-
I sion abroad was to learn the amount of
; compensation paid railway companies
! there for carrying mails. Results in this
; direction are not satisfactory, as both the
English and Continental systems of book
keeping are different from the American
system. Generally speaking, there is
! hardly a foreign idea that can be adapted
to the American service with beneficial
results. In one respect, that of prompt
city deliveries, London and European
citl?s generally are ahead of New York
and American cities.
London has about three times as many
carriers and clerks as are attached to
New York's postofflce, but the pay of the
men is much less than in this city. Su
perintendent Bradley has arrived at the
conclusion that it takes three foreign car
riers or clerks to do what one American
does.
"In England." said Mr. Loud, "we found
| tho operation of a telegraphic service by
. the Postoffice Department a costly thing
for the Government. During only two out
of the twenty years, 1 believe, that the
1 Government lias operated lines have tlia
never Jacked defenders in every crisis of
Its history. From the revolutionary days
to the present the citizens of the L'nited
States have been ever ready to uphold at
any cost the flag and the honor of the na
tion and to take all the responsibilities,
born of duty, that can never be repudi
ated. Duty unperformed is dishonor, and
dishonor brings shame, which is heavier
to carry than any burden which honor
can impose. My fellow citizens, I thank
you for this more than gracious â¢velcome
and bid you all good morning."
Secretary of War Root, Secretary of the
Navy Long and Attorney General
Griggs also made short but patriotic
speeches.
PEORIA, 111., Oct. 6. -Between Quincy
and Peoria three brief stops were made at
Macomb, Canton and Bushnell. At each
of these stations the President was es
corte*d from the train to platforms erected
for the ocasion. The entire population of
these towns appeared to have turned out
to greet the chief magistrate, and he was
invariably welcomed with boundless en
thusiasm and applause. At Macomb the
President said:
"My fellow-citizens: I thank you for
this cordial greeting and generous wel
come. It is a pleasure for me to look into
your faces, to feel your warm hearts and
to know that you are interested in the
prosperity and honor of the Government
of the United States. These great assem
blages of the people teach patriotism, and
patriotism Is the mighty power that sus
tains the Government in peace and unites
us in war. (Great applause.) The patriot,
loves his home, his family, his profession,
his farm, his books, but he has a great
love which includes all theseâ he loves his
country. (Great applause.) No more
splendid exhibition of patriotism was ever
shown than was exhibited a few days ago
in the distant Philippines. (Appiause.)
That gallant Tennessee Regiment from
our Southern border, that has been absent
from home and family and friends for
more than a year, was embarked on ship
homeward bound. When the enemy at
tacked our forces remaining near Cebu
these magnificent soldiers disembarked
from their ship and Joined their comrades
on the firing line and achieved a glorious
triumph for American arms. (Groat ap
plause.) That is an example of patriot
ism that should be an inspiration to duty
to all of us in every part of our common
country."
The speech of President McKinley at
Bushnell was as follows:
"My fellow-citizens: I thank you for
this warm welcome. I thank the chil
dren of the schools for coming to give me
greeting with the Hag of our country in
their hands. The last two years have
registered not alone our martial triumph,
hut have recorded equal triumphs in
peace. We have not only overcome In the
war with Spain, but we have overcome
the enemies of prosperity and scattered
their forces, and to-day the I'nited States
is enjoying an era of prosperity unprece
dented In our history. No man rejoices
m<>re in that fact than do I, because it
bus taken blessings to the homes and the

MEETS COLONEL BRYAN
PEORIA. 111., Oct. B.â Colonel William
Jennings Bryan sat directly behind Presi
dent McKinley this afternoon at Canton,
111., while the President delivered a brief
address to the citizens of that town. A
street fair is in progress at Canton and
Colonel Bryan had been secured to de
liver a two hours' speech. The Nebraskan
was among the first to greet President
McKinley as ho left the train and ascend
ed the platform. Whea the President ion
eluded his address he turned and neartily
grasped Colonel Bryan's outstretched
hand.
"(Jood-by, Mr. President," said Colonel
Bryan, and the President responded with
a word of farewell. This closed the short
meeting between the former rivals of
1596, as the Presidential train lc-ft immedi
ately. Colonel Bryan delivered his address
after the departure of the President.

Engineers Qlaim That the Ruling of
the Secretary Does Not Follow
the Intent of the
Law.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLING
TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON. Oct. 6.â
The operation of the new personnel law of
the navy, which went into effect on July
1 last, does not meet with the approval
of a large number of Jhe former engineer
officers. One able member of that corps
has already resigned, and others are likely
to follow. The Engineer Corps:, it will be
remembered, was merged with the line
corps, taking rank with the latter, and
the Engineer Corps has ceased to exist.
The duties hitherto performed on board
ship and ashore by engineer officers solely
will In the course of time be distributed
among officers who, without being spe
cialists, show an aptitude and preference
for such service. In other words, it will
be attempted to make the line officer fit
for all-around duty on deck and In the
engine-room, and there are already mis- ;
givings as to the practical working of j
this plan.
Of the 170 officers of the defunct Engin- j
eer Corps there were on July 1 ten who |
became captains and sixteen ranking as ',
commanders. The average ages of these j
two grades were 60 and 56 years, respect
ively; their tour of sea duty has termin
ated, and they will hencetorth perform
engineer duty on shore only. Twenty
eight lieutenant commanders of 49 years !
average age are to perform engineer duty i
at sea or on shore unless they qualify
for general duties of the line by examina
tion, in which latter event they will be
eligible for command and other duties of
the line. Next follows forty-five lieuten- i
ants, of which the hrst twenty-five aver- |
age 43 years and the other twenty about i
40 years, who are in the same category as
the lieutenant commanders. Seventy-one
lieutenants of the two grades and ensigns
are slated to perform iine duty, but are |
required to qualify by examination for j
such duty after March 3. 1901.
General order No. 524 Issued by the Navy !
Department formulates and defines the j
duties of former engineer officers, and
also those of the warrant machinists, of <
which latter a corps of one hundred war
rant officers is in course of formation. A
certain number of the former engineer
officers, embracing seventy-three lieuten
ant commanders and lieutenants, are up
in arms against the new law, claiming
that the Secretary's ruling is contrary
to the intent of Congress. The Secretary
has already issued orders to about thirty
of these officers to prepare for sea duty
and for a course of instruction in line
work. It Is evident that none of the lieu
tenant commanders and at least twenty
five of the lieutenants are suited for such
change- of work, and that it will simply
be a waste of time for men on the shady
side of 40 to attempt to learn a new pro
fession. On the other hand, no line officer |
has as yet been ordered to qualify for en
gineering duty, but upward of seventy of
the recently appointed warrant machinists
have been assigned to ships and will per
form the duties hitherto carried on by
engineer officers. The line officers are evi
dently getting even with the former en
gineers for the lntter's assurance to de
mand positive rank, and the Bureau of
Navigation is doing some artistic Italian
work. The engineers were only after the
rank of line officers, but did not wish to
perform the duties of line officers. Much
against the wishes of the greater number,
they are now forced to go through a
course of line duty instruction, for which
they have no taste, and failing in the
(nullifying examinationâ which the major
ity are surf tn doâ their position is some
what humiliating.
It has always been contended by the ma- ]
jorlty of line officers that the duties of a
high priced and highly scientific officer on
board ship could be equally well per
formed by a warrant engineer at $100 per
month. This is now being done, and i
places the scientific commissioned en
gineer officer on a level with the warrant
machinist. It would appear as if the
whilom engineers made a bad bargain
when they bartered their substantial ex
istence as a special corps for the empty
honor of military titles. As for the war
rant machinists' corps, composed of prac
tical engineers competent to care for and
to run and repair their engines, it is only
a matter of a few years when it will
clamor for commissions as regular officers
in the navy, and It is sure to succeed just
as the recent engineer corps had pro
gressed from plain "greasers" to commis
sioned officers.

ARMY MULES LOST
EN ROUTE TO MANILA
WASHINGTON. Oct. 6.â A cable mes
sage from General Otis to the War De

eral hundred horses and mules on the
transport Slam. The message reads as
follows:
"MANILA. Oct. 6.â The steamer Slam,
which left San Francisco on August 18
with 45 horses and 21!S mule-s, encountered
a typhoon on the 21st in Northern Luzon,
In which all but about sixteen mules per
ished. The animals were killed by the
pitching of the vessel and lack of air
from the necessary closing- of the hatches.
There were no casualties among the pas
sengers. OTIS."
It is stated at the quartermaster's de
partment that the mules which were lost
on the Slam were trained park animals
and considered the most valuable sent to
the Philippines.
MANILA. Oct. 6.â The Siam, which left
Honolulu thirty-one days ago with 300
mules aboard, encountered several ty
phoons early this week. One lasted forty
hours. Most of the forage, which was
on deck, was swept overboard, all the
heats were smashed in. and the steamer
rolled tremendously in the trough of the
sea, although the officers made every ef
fort to bring her about.
The mules were hurled from side to side
and frightfully mangled and disembow
â  â¢ 1. Their legs and necks were broken
and the wretched animals fell in such a
confused mass that the attendants were :
unable to relieve thÂ«n.
In the meantime the deckload was
washed off, the ship lightened and the
rolling Increased.
When the storm abated the injured ani
mals were killed and their carcasses
thrown overboard. When the Siam ar
rived her propeller was high out of the |
water and the wrecks of her boats were j
hanging from the davits.

City Government Will
Be Reorganized.
SDOclal Dispatch lo The Call.
PLACEKVILLE, Oct. 6.â A compromise
has been finally consummated by the
citizens' committee of fifteen and Drury
Melone whereby the city has at last come
into possession of the railroad bonds Is
sued by it in the early sixties to assist
in the construction of the old Sarramento
Valley Railroad to this city. The com
pany failed to build to the city and the
municipal authorities refused to make
any provision for the payment of the
bonds. In 1872 the city government re
signed, and since that time Placervillu
has been without any local government.
The debt, with accrued interest, had
reached a total of $284,300. An effort was
made by Melone at the last session of the
Legislature to secure remedial legisla
tion that would enable him to secure ser
vice upon the city. The bill was fought
bitterly, The Call coming to the rescue
of the city, and was finally defeated. Af
ter the defeal of his bill Melone agreed
to tako the sum of $36,150 25 in full settle
ment of all the outstanding bonds. His
terms were accepted, and ins of the prin
cipal property-holders joined in a note
for that amount, which was given to a
prominent San Francisco bank and the
money used to purchase the bonds.
The city government will be at once re
organized and a new set of bonds sold and
â¦he note liquidated.
The debt has been a great Incumbrance
upon Placerville for more than a quarter
of a century, and every resident of the
city rejoices that the compromise has at
last been completely perfected.

small country schoolhouse, has been de-
Btroyed while not in use. It is believed

bringing with him Albert Kraus, former
manager of a portrait company, who is
charged with seduction under promise of
marriage. The complaining witness is a
prominent young lady of Healdsburg.
Kraus explains his absence upon the day
set for the wedding by saying be did not
and not too far north, thus Indicating the
neighborhood of his former residence and
the club where he had spent a good deal
of his leisure time. First of all he want)
the house at the earliest possible moment,
so that he might "go in and hang up his
hat at once,", as he put it. Of course
that precluded the idea of erecting a
house to meet his special needs. He ex
pressed his ideas as to the character of
the homo he desires and asked that the
house be modest enough in appointments
and cost to permit of the retention of a
sufficient sum of money from the pur
chase fund to defray the expense of fur
nishing it. The committee listened atten
tively to all these wishes and saw no rea
son why all could not be gratified.
The admiral is going to New York and
will Bee the yachts on his way to Shell
burn farm, Vermont. He expects to re
turn to Washington in a week or bo.
Meanwhile the house committee having
invited written proposals on property,
will, so through the list carefully and
hope to be able to present to the admiral
on his return as many as half a dozen
available bouses from which he may
make a personal selection. The fund at
the disposal of the committee now
amounts to about $50,000, and it is earn
estly desired that this sum may be sub

VALUABLE STAMP.

In the year IRSI a twelve-penny black

One of these stamps was sent to the

WANTS TOO MUCH
Opinions of Minister of
Justice of Canada.
BOUNDARY LINE OF ALASKA
ONE OF THE POINTS NAMED
DOES NOT EXIST.
Â»
Hon. David Mills Thinks the Eule of
"What We Have We'll Hold"
Applies in the Boundary
i Dispute.
SpÂ«cial Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C, Oct. 6.â Speaking at
a mass meeting on the Alaskan boundary
question, Hon. David Mills, Minister of
Justice of Canada, said:
"While we are prepared to make con
cessions in regard to trade and to estab
lishing a friendly feeling we are unwilling
to surrender any portion of Canada to the
United States. I have no desire that the
people of this country undertake to ac
quire territory that does not belong to
them, but I would like to adopt the rule
that 'what we have we'll hold.'
"In 1824 the question arose between Rus
sia and Great Britain In regard to the lo
cation of the boundry between the fishing
posts that Russia hud and the trading
posts of England in the interior. The
question was in regard to the territory
north of 54.40. All south of 54.40 was ad
mitted to be the property of the United
States, and the treaty of 1524 was made
for the purpose of drawing a line between
the territory of Russia and Great Britain.
The treaty does not refer to anything
south of 54.40. All it deals with is the ter
ritory north of that latitude. The treaty
provides that the boundary begin at the
extremity of Prince of Wales Island and
from there up Portland channel to where
the 56th parallel touches the shore. But
ascending Portland channel the direction
is not northward, but eastward, and it
would be strange If Portland channel was
Intended. To ascend northward to where
the 66th parallel touches shore one would
have to ascend Clarence channel where
there is a point where the 56th parallel
touches water. There is no such point on
Portland channel. Then the boundary is
to follow the line of the coast range no
matter how high or how low the range
may be. But if the range recedes from
the coast more than thirty miles, then the
boundary is to be drawn at thirty miles.
There are points where it cuts through
the mountains. According to international
law, I say you do not go around such
arms, but from the crests on one side to
the other. The treaty also provides that
ships of each nation have a right to trade
in the waters for a period of ten years.
If the American contention that the line
passes around each arm be correct there
would be no water In British territory,
and that clause would be absolute non
sense.
"According: to the treaty the line must
be drawn so as to leave some portion of
the sea in British territory. We offered
a compromise, allowing the" United States
to ha\e Dyea and and give us
Pyramla harbor. They said 'No. we will
not compromise, and we cannot arbitrate,
for the arbitrators might decide against
us Give us everything in dispute and we
will arbitrate the remainder.'
"We are in favor of a fair and just set
tlement, as,..ng nothing we do not believe
is ours, and If mistaken arbitrators will
decide against us and we are content.
But we art- never content to have our ter
ritory squatted upon and held by squat
tors right of few years' standing."

ABALONE FISHING CHECKED.
Ordinance Adopted by Monterey's
Board of Supervisors.
MONTEREY. Oct. 6.â The Board of
Supervisors of Monterey County has Just
passed an ordinance prohibiting any com
pany or corporation from catching aba
lone shellfish for the purpose of curing

the coast line between a line drawn due
west from the Carmel River and the
southern boundary line of Monterey
County, and making it unlawful to nsh
for abalone except In deep water and by
means of diving apparatus or other deep
sea devices. A license of $60 is also to be
charged in the future for fishing for
abalone.
This ordinance Is the result of a fight
between the city of Monterey, seeking to
stop the catching and shipping out of
the county of abalone or abalone shells,
and the Japanese cannery, that has car
ried on an extensive business at a plant
on Carmel Bay, about six miles south of
Monterey, for the past year, and is in
the nature of a compromise between the

POUNDMASTER SAVED BY
THE DOG HE SPARED
Dan Slinkey of Sausalito Would Have
Drowned Had It Not Been for the
Sagacity of a Dog.
SAL'SALITO, Oct. 6.â Dan Slinkey, the local poundmaster, who has the rec
ord of killing more dog-s than any other man In California, came within a
hair's breadth of losing his life in the waters of the bay lastfnight, and the
fact that he is still in the land of the living is due to a dogâ a poor, miser
able little cur that Slinkey should have killed weeks ago if he had followed
strictly the rules laid down by the ordinance. But for some reason â Slinkey
now inclines to the opinion that it was fate â he spared the dog simply be
cause it looked so lonely and miserable that he had not the heart to put an
end to the creature's life. The poundmaster now thanks his lucky star he
didn't, for If he had a watery grave would have been his portion.
Last night Slinkey came over on the late boat from San Francisco, closely
followed by the yellow dog, which has never forsaken him since he spared
its life and gave it a good meal. As the boat docked Dan got headed in the
wrong direction, and instead of walking off the boat upon the slip ambled off
the other end into the bay. As soon as he hit the water the dog heard the
splash and ran to the edge of the boat. Seeing its friend struggling in the
water the dog uttered a howl and darted back to the restaurant of the boat,
where a number of deckhands were congregated. By howling and whining
and running a short distance away, only to return and make more signs of
â  distress when It perceived that it was not followed, the faithful brute man
aged to notify the deckhands that something was wrong. They followed it
to the end of the boat and saw Slinkey floundering in the water. It was the
work of a few moments to procure a rope and drae the unfortunate pound
master out of his predicament. He was so weak when he reached the deck
of the boat that he sank down exhausted. Dan now freely admits that he
o\ve9 his life to the dog as well as the dog its existence to him, and here
after will see that It never lacks protection if he has to pay Its license out
of his own pocket.
Two years ago Slinkey was found lying close to the railroad track with
his arm crushed. He had evidently been struck by a train and hurled to one
side of the track instead of being thrown under the wheels of the engine. He
has also had a number of other narrow escapes from a violent death.
TWO MEN ROB A
GAMBLING HOUSE
Faro Dealer Held Up
With a Pistol.
Bpeclal Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
PHOENIX, Ariz.. Oct. 6.â The Palace
saloon and gambling house, owned by
Gus Hirschfeld, was held up at 2:30 o'clock
this morning by two bandits and $245 was
secured. Mr. Hirschfeld was behind the
bar when the robbers entered the saloon.
They came in with their faces hidden be
hind handkerchiefs and danced about the
room, brandishing their six-shooters, each
m;m having two guns.
Mr. Hirschfeld thought It was a joke
being played on the place, but when one
of the men approached the faro game and
ordered the dealer to hold up his hands
the proprietor saw at once that the men
meant business. One of the robbers stood
in the center of the room guarding his
pal who was robbing the bank. Mr.
Hirschfeld secured his six-shooter and
fired at the robber who stood guard. The
robber returned the lire, but neither bul
let took effect.
The robber who went after the monpy
grabbed at a pile of $5 gold pieces as the
snooting was going on, and the money
was scattered over the floor in his ex
citement. Both men escaped. There were
but few people in the saloon at the time
of the robbery, and those, who witnessed
it could not give any description of the
robbers, so that the police are working
without a clew.

PROTECTING THE FORESTS.
Work of Forest and Water Associa-

LOS ANGELES, Oct. 6.â W. Q. Kerck
hoff, president of the Forest and Water
Association of Los Angeles, said to-day
in reference to th 9 work of the associa
tion:
"The Forest and Water Association had
in contemplation the thorough explora
tion and mapping of our forest reserves,
but owing 10 the shortage of funds has
not been able to send out a properly
equipped engineering and surveying party.
However, the students of the forestry
branch of the University of Southern
California volunteering to do this work.
the association arranged for J. H. Nicoli
and C. C. Mitnning to go into the San
Gabriel forest through the San Gabriel
Canyon and make a thorough report on
the varieties of timber and brush growing
in the forest reserves, reporting the
growth on each quarter section of the
territory Investigated; also noting the
best possible points for starting replant
ing.
"It is not expected that the association,
with its available funds, can do much In
the way of replanting, but it is thought
that if it can be demonstrated that thia
work can be done at a reasonable cost
that the Government may possibly be in
duced to make appropriations for thia
purpose.
"The association has also been gather-
Ing a lot of seed of the native growth,
as well as the seed of the Sequoia Gigan
tea ol the Northern Sierras, which it in
tends to plant out during the present
fall.
"We were all pleased this year, not
withstanding the extreme dryness, that
we did not have the usual amount of for
est fires, due undoubtedly to the greater
vigilance of the forest patrol. Thia
should be very much increased, and it
should be possible with the proper super
vision of people entering the reservation
to restrict still further the forest fires,
perhaps entirely prevent them."

ful sprinters, hurdlers and jumpers have j
trained as faithfully for the meeting as j
do the men of the colleges for their con- j
tests on path and field. These field days â¢
are never one sided, as the struggle for
first place is invariably in doubt until the .
last event has been decided.
The young athletes, the majority of
whom are yet In their "teens. " always
receive the encouragement of their school
mates. The pupils gather under their own
banner and whenever one of their repre-
Bentatives wins the colors of the school
flash into sight and lend a dash of color
to the whito dresses of the girls and the
more somber garb of the boys.
The championship rests between Berke
ley. Vktah and Oakland this afternoon. ,
Berkeley and Oakland will send the fast- !
est sprinters to the path, while 1 kiah Is
strong in the field events and in the hur
dles At least two records are at the i
mercy of the stout-limbed youngsters, i
HondYickson and Thomas have each run i
120 yards over the sticks in 17 seconds in j
practice. The record is held jointly by
Hendrickson and Hoffman at 17 1-5 sec- :
onds When the spirit of competition stirs
the men in this race there Is no telling |
what time the watches will register.

emio record of 10 feet 3 _ inches and j

Mr. Black heads the list of men who
have drawn positions on the Olympic duck
preserve for to-morrow. The remaining
members of the party are: Fred Feud
ner. W. A. Marshall. L. W. Hartin. Dr.
F. J. Lane. H. B. Rose. Dr. G. W. Klei
ser. E. Hirshfeld. Ed Dubedat and George

The annual meeting of the Olympic Gun
Club will be held on the 25th inst. A reg
ular nominating committee will be ap
pointed at that time to select officers for
the ensuing term.
A part} of gentlemen of this city have
recently returned from an extended out
ing in Nevada and Idaho, and bring: won
derful stories of their experiences in the
field. The party was made up of Attor
ney J. \Y. Dorsey. Judge A. A. Sanderson
G. H. Umbsen. P. K. Gordon. D. R. Ses
sions. E. A. Kefl. Mr. Tucker. Sydney
Smith, A. J. Harrold of Visalia and John
Sparks of Reno. The range over which
the party shot is owned by the last two
gentlemen and is about seventy-five by
100 mil*-? square. It abounds in "deer, an
telope, bears, grouse of every description
and ducks. Its streams are tilled with
brook trout, fishermen of the party se
curing 300 in â ...- morning. They bring
back a niMnber of stories of the" chase.
The most remarkable of these Is to the
effect that a vaquero with the party was
standing on a high bluff and saw a bear
at its base He dropped a huge rock on
his bearshlp, killing him instantly. Judge
Sanderson vouches for this narrative, al
though he says he did not lose any bears
himself and did not seek those reported
in the vicinity of the camp. The bears
are a cross between the grizzly and the
cinnamon. They possess all the ferocity
ot the former with the speed of the lat
ter. In rough going they can travel faster
than a horse.
E. G. Rodolph and Judge Evans left
yesterday for the Eel River country They
go chiefly for quail, but will also avail
themselves of the flsnlng offered in that
district.
A large number of gunmen opened the
duck season at Johnsons, near Brent
wood, and enjoyed excellent sport. There
are no preserves on what la known lo
cally as the Old River, hence its popu
larity. The exact opening of the season
was not observed, as the shooting com
menced on Friday and was continued Sat
urday.
LAST OF THE CRICKET MATCHES
The last match on the schedule of the
California Cricket Association will be
played at Alameda to-morrow between
the Pacific and California teams. The re
suit will, however, not have any influence
on the awarding of the Brown pennant
for 1599, which has already been captured
by the California Club. The Californias
have already won eight out of the eleven
matches in which they have played, so
that their percentage is .727. The Ala
medas have scored six points out of a
possible twelve, their percentage being
.600. The Pacifies have scored three points
out of a possible eleven, making their
percentage .272. Should the Califomiaa
win to-morrow their percentage will be
.730. that of the Alamedas .500, and that
of the Pacifies ."ISO.
The representatives of the Pacifies in
to-morrow's match will be: George Theo

Tibbetts. has been played for in four tour
naments, the victors In which were Vice
Captain P. E. Bowles, E. R. Folger, D.

include competitions on Thanksgiving day
and Washington's birthday.
Secretary H. M. a Miller of th Oak

I make any advance without the coaching
I of a thoroughly expert golfer, who is at

{ military elliptical target at 30 yards on
â an open range. This is without doubt th*
best record of Its kind with a ml!itar>
revolver. The ammunition used was the
new army smokeless powder cartridge.
! One of the remarkable features of the
performance was that during the entire
shooting the weapon was not cleaned.

teams as the gap between them is small.
The loaders may be overtaken in 4 he
coming race if â Hank" Harris' men find
Harvey's curves as readily as they did
Whalen's last week. Sullivan behind the
bat seems to have steadied the local nine.
"With the new order of things San Fran
cisco is a much stronger team than it has
been for several months. The men are
playing in. championship form and will
give the leaders a tussle. Harris thinks
lberg is the most effective twirler he has
when playing against Sacramento.
Two games will be played on Sunday
at Oakland between Santa Cruz and Oak

John Butler is expected home from his
annual fishing pilgrimage to Eel River to

salmon in one day. Mr. Hollingsberry
captured a salmon weighing forty-two
pounds. Mrs. Hollingsberry secured thir
teen in one morning, the aggregate weight
cf which was 15 1 * pounds. Mr. and Mrs.
Hollingsberry were at Capitola for the
Bummer, and went salmon fishing every
morning for one week. During that time
they landed 184 fish. All fishing was done
with trout line, reel and pole. On the
morning when the largest salmon was

left their moorings at Tiburon. intending
to sail up to McNears Landing and drop

Webb, is in good trim and feels sure of
retaining the championship. As the club
has no fast skiffs, it is probable that F.
W. Avers will not pull in the senior skiff
race, but Edwin T. Thorning will enter
the junior event. The Alameda junior
barge crew is made up thus: George
Lewis bow; B. Guild. No. 2; D. Green
leaf, No. 3. and E. M. Hunter, stroke.
As Dr. B. I. Wheeler, the new president
of the University of California, seems to
appreciate the value ot rowing as an ath
letic exercise, it may reasonably be hoped
that he will encourage the sport among
the undergraduates, and that representa
tives of the university may in future be
seen at all open competitions on the bay.
Nothing would do so much to excite gen
eral public interest in rowing contests as
the establishment of a race between th*>
universities of California and Stanford"
It would lead to the best and most in
teresting form of rowingâ in eight-oared
boatsâ and would attract the attention of
a social class which has heretofore al
most entirely disregarded the sport.
HOMING PIGEONS RECORD
In a record fly last Sunday under the
auspices of the California Homing Pigeon
Club birds from the l"ft of William Har J
tery made a new coast record for yount, j
birds. The record had been held by John
Filmer's great bird Hobson, made in a i
flight from Red Bluff. The new record is i
from Redding, twenty miles beyond. Mr. I
Hartery's bird, registered AISB, was re
leased at 7:25 a. m.. and arrived at its '
owner's loft at 12:53:43. The airline dis- j
tance has not been calculated, hence the !
speed per minute is not known at prese-nt. j
The performance of the winner is pro- i
nounced the best ever shown on this coast
for a long distance.
A. Benjamin's bird. "W754, arrived at
12:54, only fifteen seconds later than the
time the winner was registered.. H. Van !
Cortebeek's birds -were not reported.
The second race of the Southern series
will be flown from Tres Pinos to-morrow.
The same birds will compete that were en- I
tered in the race from San Jose two we^ks
since. On that occasion John Filmer's i
bird finished first.
on the next day. The California. close on
the 2Sth. and take the last cruise in squad
ron of IS9S on the following: Sunday. The
South Bay yachts will be the last to fold
their white wings and seek winter quar
ters. Some of the southern yachtsmen
are planning to take their families and
friends for a rambling- cruise to Vallejo,
Benicia. and up the Sacramento and San
Joaquin rivers. October 15 is "commo
dore's day." October 29 is "ladies' day"
and the closing clambake of the seasonis
set for November 12. Most of the yachts
will then go out of commission, but a few
will cruise occasionally during the win
ter. The life-saving boat purchased from
the transport Sherman by the Coykendail
brothers la thirty feet loner and has a
beam of nine feet. She Is being rigged as
a yawl at Alviso and will be towed down
the channel by the gasoline launch A an.)
C. The South Bays expect several new
members, who will build or buy yachts.
The two "no races" between the Colum
bia and the Shamrock have been entirely
inconclusive as to the real merits of the
yachts, but the Shamrock has shown that
she is faster in light airs than even her
friends believed her to be. That she was
better handled than the Columbia on
Tuesday seems generally admitted. In a
hard blow her somewhat heavier build,
greater displacement and stability should
tell decidedly in her favor. In Thursday's
trial she was said to point higher than
the Columbia. She will probably be stif
fer in heavy weather than the Columbia,
and her greater sail area should drive her
through the water at high speed. Fife
seems to have cleverly designed a boat
which, while bigger In almost every de
tail than her antagonist, with longer
spars, greater beam, more canvas and fif
teen tons greater displacement, yet re
ceives time allowance from her-
STANFORD AND
OLYMPICS ON
THE GRIDIRON
Opening of the Winter Series of Foot
ball Games in This
Crip
The initial gridiron contest of the sea
son played last Saturday between Cali
fornia and the Olympics on the Berkeley
. -.v:;s a prelude to \: â  which
will begin t >-day. Stanford will line up
for the first time ag.i Ã¼bmen on
â  w football grounds at Sixteenth and
â 
This time the Olympics say thpy will
md it" form counts for anythii ~g
the clubmen should v.-in out. The team
will be opposed to the Olympics th.a
.. untrained as a team and
is in the pr development. Physi
cally the Stanford eleven will be In much
Ution than the Olympics, as tha
y< men are following out all train
ing rules prescribed. The club athletes
are slowly rounding into shape, but their
work la light and they still lark the actual
practice which comes from game strug-
gles.
California did not disappoint its adher
ents last Saturday. The men played to
gether, showing the effects of last season's
training. What was lacking was the dash
and daring that characterized California's
play during the last few weeks of the sea
son of .ISsSs. The blue and gold is in the
best shape, of all, but Coach Cochran
claims this will prove detrimental to a
corresponding progress in the team's play.
He says that the earn is by no mean 3
formed, picked or chosen, and the men
v/ho are playing in it may and will be dis
placed if they do not continue to improve
and surpass the men on the second eleven,
in effective football work.
Chamberlin and Cochran met last Sat
urday for the first time in two years.
Chamberlin was a spectator of the foot
ball game as Cochran's guest. In talking
over the prospects of the season both
were non-committal in every particular
except oneâ the paucity of good material
on which to work. Neither coach has any
new material which is strikingly good. At
both universities the men who are trying
for positions on the teams are more or
less light In weight and unlearned in the
game. There is a plentiful supply of anx
ious, willing workers, but they are not
the kind whose physiques draw the ad
miration of the coaches.
The Olympics have been taught their
first lesson and it Is but the same version
of the ancient football stor.tâ matter
what the personnel at the team may be, it
must have team action and the men must
be. in good physical condition. The college
athletes had played for a week against
an opposing force and had become accus
tomed to the active work of a contest
With all their superabundance of weight
and advantage of experience the heavy
powerful men on the Olympic team could
do but little against their lighter and
younger opponents. It is almost impossi
ble for the Olympic Club to enlist enough
men in its service to secure regular prac
tice games.
The club team will line up to-day with a
change in the personnel. "Pete" Smith's
injury has put him out of the gam- for
the year, and Bandy will occupy the cen
tral position on the line, while Hobbs will
play left guard, "Gene" Sheehy received
an injury while at practice on Monday
evening, and it is likely he will not be seen
with the clubmen this afternoon his place
being filled by Monroe. Gaylord who
played end last week, has retired from the
game this year, and Crum has not been
playing this week. Thterkauf will return
to his old place at end, and the reliable
the oldest Roman of them all, Feltori
Taylor, will be sten as fullback.
Stanford will play many men, giving
all the likely candidates a chance at the
game. As the Palo Alto team was in an
unsettled state at the beginning of the
season the process of selection and classi
fying is still going on. Chamberlin has
won the support of the college and every
body, player or student, is working with" a
will.
California's coach. Garrett Cochran
will be assisted next week by "King" Kel
ly, whose arrival was scheduled ye<:te*-
day. The rumor is that Kelly will be
coach in chief of the blue and gold next
year, and that is the chief reason of the
engagement for this season.
A sub-league among the preparatory
pchools has been formed. The schools reD
resented are Hoitt's. Menlo Park ~ Palo
Alto High School. Manzanita Hall at Palo
Alto, San Jose State Normal Belmont

The 2:17 Pace at Lexington Results
in a Surprise.
LEXINGTON, Oct. 6.â The crowd tell
off some from that of yesterday, but it
was still large. The October wind had a
biting touch which made overcoats neces
sary. Tho track was in fine condition. The
paeinff Futurity, which should have been
the- feature of the day, was a farce. Glory
broke repeatedly in both heats and so
badly in the last that Lucie May dis
tanced her.
The 2:17 pace was a big- surprise. Tom
AVilkes sold for 25 to 13 in the first heat
and 25 to 10 in the second. He won both
with apparent ease. For the third Wilkes

to going to the post for the race for the

CHICAGO. Oct. b.â Kid McCoy and JoÂ«
Choynski fought six rounds before the
Fort Dearborn Athletic Club to-night.
Both men had agreed to a draw In case
they were on their feet at the end of the
sixth round and that was the decision, as
both wire not only on their feet but com*
tively fresh. McCoy, however, clear
iy outpointed the California*] and scored
the only knockdown of the fight, putting
Joe to the boards with a left hook to
mouth in the third round. The Kid
made a careful fight Â»if it. He took no
chances whatever, consenting himselt aÂ»
a rule with jabbing ChoynskJ with his
left. He used his right but seldom, but
it generally counted hard when he did pui
it in operation. Choynski scored many
times, bringing thp blood from McCoy's
nose in the rust round and once or twice
McCoj considerably with his
right. Many of his blows, however, fell
short.
In the preliminary Billy Kauffman ot
St I.' vis and Jack Robinson of Chicago
I'.iught a six-round draw. Lew Mnnsfielrt
hicago knocked out Jack Palvey of
Chicago in the first round and Jack Hud
son put Jim wuinn away In four rounds.

Three Choices First at

Friday never was noted for being a

not ragged, nor were they high class, but
still they furnished some very fair sport.
The first choices continued to hold their
own by capturing three of the five events
decided, and there was no complaint over
"reversals."
To sulking Grady belongs the honor ot
being the star coin gatherer. The bay
horse was almost entirely overlooked in

15 to 1. Jerid was the market favorite,
and starttd out at a terrific clip. Little
Ryan tried to place him on the back-
Ptretch. but broke it up badly, setting
hopelessly pocketed. P. A. Flnnegan then
tuok up the running, leading to within a
sixteenth from the home plate. Grady
there passed him, winning with ease in
1:42, Donator made a miserable showing.
After a "lay off" of several days Eddie
Jones arrived in town and had his friends
down on The Buffoon to win the opening
two-year-old sprint. The Buffoon was
played from 8 to 34, and Eddie tried hard
to play cushion caroms with the favorite,
My Gypsy, but was beaten out. His little
bJt of pleasantry caused him to be fined
$25 by the stand. Summer ran third.
The mile and a furlong run, decided un
der selling conditions, fell to Opponent,
the post favorite, with Devin up. Mamie
<; at lirst commanded first call in the
ring, but her price receded. Opponent was
best at the close, catching Kapido and
beating him out nearly a length, with
something to spare. Mamie G, under
v>..-;ik riding, ran third.
Pat Morrissey stepped "to taw" without
the asking in the fourth recital, over
seven furlongs. A 1 to 5 chance, he won
in romping fashion from Socialist. Feb
ruary wa* a tired third.
The last race of the day resulted in a
big upset. Novia carried the big money
bet at odds of 3 to 5 and was headed fmrn
tho start by Negligence, a 6 to 1 shot.
Kellas, who rode the winner, left the
maiden jockey class on this occasion.
Campus, a SO to 1 shot, took the show.

THE GHEES ARE FEEDING
THEIR NEEDY RELATIVES
ANNUAL FESTIVAL OF A POW
ERFUL CHINESE FAMILY.
For Four Days They Will Pray and
Play and Eat and Burn Punk
and Sandal Wood.
Spofford alley is a blaze of light and
color; a shuffling, shifting mass of Chi
nese humanity; a turmoil of iiddle and
horn and gong and cymbal; a haze of in
cense and heavy with the perfume of san
dal wood. The Ghee Kung long is giv
ing its annual feast, and the success of
I such affairs is proportionate to the din of
| the bands, the gorgeousness an-.l profusion
| of the color and the pungency of the san
j dal wood. This year it seems to be tx-
j ceeding Us lurmer efforts.
I The feast is given lor all the poor mem-
I hers of the family of Ghee, one of the
I largest and most powerful in China and
! among her emigrants. Twice a day fur
' four days the needy Ghees will be cailed
jin and their baskets and buckets lllied
I with the best of the season from a Chi
nese standpoint. But the hungry Ghees
j are not the only guests to the feast. There
are seveial bewhiskered old gods, good
and bad, sort of pensioners of the family,
who are also bidden to the festal board.
They are brought rigged in full regalia
and hideous as Chinese art can make
them. Most of them linger around in
back rooms for the four days of the cele
bration, and then the whole family of
them is tak^n out and burned with great
rejoicing. The bad ones are burned bt
cause it is good for them; the good ones
because it will do them no harm, and be
sides is the most picturesque way of get
tiny rid of them, and the whole term of
excitement ends in a blaze, some smoke
and a rile of ashes.
The celebration commenced last evening
at 7 o'clock. It took a string of red robed
and ancient priests, with me accompani
ment of several Chinese bands, to start it,
but by midnight it was going in good
shape, and most of the air in the alley
I had given plate to the fumes from the
1 incense pots. Two gods, particularly large
and particularly ugly, were placed out in
the alley under the canopy tnat had been
erected;" half a dozen more spare ones
were placed In under a flight of stairs,
handy In case of necessity, and a few
more with no immediate duties to attend
to were scattered through rooms of the
adjoining houses, for the theater of ac
i tlon takes up not only the alley itself but
' all the houses the Ghees can afford to
rent for the occasion.
The hangings and canopies are really t
gorgeous and the Ghees take pride in the j
fact that they have been sent out from
China for this special occasion. There are
also a number of groups of wax rigures
representing scenes from great Chinese
plays, and there are any number of Josh ;
men. Theso old priests pray as long as i
they can, and then while they rest the j
bands have a chance, which they improve j
with vigor and vociferation.
The needy relatives will be fed in the
mornings and at 4 o'clock in the after
noons. They will not be asked for cre
dentials, so it is safe to say the number '
of Ghees will increase materially until the |
next few days have passed. On Monday
night it will end. and after 12 o'clock the
whole company of gods will have to come
out into the firelight and be burned. Then
the family duty to the poor relatives is
off until next fall.

The Monument League Meets and

A meeting of the executive committee of
the I-incoln Monument league was held
last evening at the rooms of the I'mon
League Club. President W. W. stone
acted as chairman. The members listened
to the reading of the various reports and
1 ho debates on the questions to which they
gave rise.
The committee reported that the design

offered at the last meeting, and which
called for an expenditure of $36,000, was
not accepted, being not in accordance with
I the dignity of the subject. ThÂ» credit of
the State demanded something more or
nate, and the committee decided that $150.
--000 would be about the right amount to
expend in the erection of a monument
; that would fittingly commemorate the
: martyred President.
To this end the committee decided to
issue a circular calling for the organiza
tion of local executive committees In the
different counties of the State, which will
act in conjunction with the committee of
: this city, and do their best to raise their
i proportions of the sum and meet here in
general convention some time in the fore
part of February. It is expected that 2000
delegates will attend.
Many members made speeches, in which
they pledged themselves to do all in th- ir
power to further the interests of the
movement. Senator Morehouse agreed to
answer for Santa Clara County, and Sen
ator McGowan promised that' Humholdt
County would enthusiastically meet all
demands that mipht be made upon it.

The Venezuela boui pute is ended. Vene

nearly 60,000 square miles of forest land. This

THE VENEZUELAN AWARD.
BY* the award of the arbitrators at Paris England
one-third the size of California
and Venezuela gets control of the Orinoco
River. There seems to be genera! concurrence in the
award, and the fact that it was unanimous, the two
American members of the court concurring, makes
the settlement satisfactory to both hemispheres.
A question that has threatened the peace of the
world for nearly a century has disappeared in an
amicable solution by this award. It reached an acute
stage in 1805. when the United States asked England
to arbitrate it and rhe refused. This refusal was in
met by Mr. Clevel â  larkable message
which denned the Monroe doctrine and practically
wrote it into international law. That message said
plainly to England that the United States would not
permit aggression in this hemisphere by any European
power, in a matter between it and an American power,
in which arbitration had been asked id refused
Venezuela being weak, but being within the Monroe
hemisphere, must not be touched. The President
â :pon the right of the United States to ask ar
bitration between England and a South American
power, and to treat refu>al by England as an un
friendly act. He practically warned England that any
attempt of hers to change the status quo would be an
act of war against the United States.
Within four weeks England yielded, recalled her re

A SONG OF WILLOW TIT-WILLOW

AN INVITATION TO DEWEY.
REPORTS from Washing-ton are to the effect j
tl at Admiral Dewcy has about made up his
mind to make an extensive tour through the
country in response to the numerous invitations that !
have been given him. It is assured he will visit Chi
cago, and General Anderson of that city is authority
for the statement that the Admiral contemplates a
Western trip. Moreover, Senator Proctor is quoted
as having said he believes the trip may be extended '
as far as the Pacific Coast
' >n that showing it will be well for San Francisco j
to at one extend to the Admiral an invitation similar
to that given by other large cities of the Union. It*.
will be remembered that when it was known that he
was to return home he was earnestly requested to !
ccme to this port and proceed to Washington over
land. That programme the Admiral was unable to \
j carry out, but it is fairly certain that when he enters j
i upon the tour which is to give him an opportunity to j
see the full extent of the republic he will be inclined j
to come to this coast before turning back.
According to the reports the tour of the Admiral I
will begin early in November and will continue for
some weeks. Our invitation, it will be ~een. should
: be forwarded promptly so as to be in his hands when
he makes his programme for the trip. It is not a mat- i
tc-r which requires much time for consideration, as it i
is certain the people will be prompt to provide what
ever money may be required to make his welcome
worthy of his visit. There is, therefore, no reason !
why the city authorities, together with the Chamber '
of Commerce and other representative bodies, should
j not act without delay and send the invitation imme- j
diately.
There are ample grounds for supposing the Ad- !
! miral has a genuine desire to visit this part of the l
Union. It was on the Pacific Ocean he won the great i
victory that has made him the hero of his country- j
men of this generation and secured for him an Em- '
; mortality of fame, and it is but natural he should <le- i
; sire to visit the chief city of that vast section of this j
! country that looks out upon that ocean. Whether I
he can come or not, however, it will be well to give '
him the invitation. Let us show him that much evi
-1 dence of our admiration for his service, and if he come !
.to us we will give him a welcome that will be '
I memorable.
It goes without saying that, with all the people of
the nation waiting to shake hands with Dewey, the
obliging Admiral would be glad to shake the people.
ITALIANS RESENT THE EXAMINER'S
INSULT TO INVENTOR MARCONI
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Dear Sir: While, in the name
of the Italians of this city, coast and Western States, we beg to thank you
so very much for the splendid response to the gratuitous insult that the Ex
aminer has thrown to our fellow countryman. Guglielrr.o Marconi, we beg to
a^k you to kindly publish the enclosed article, which will appear in our
L'ltalia of to-morrow morning.
Your courtesy would greatly oblige all the Italians of the city and Cali
fornia, who are ail unanimous in the condemnation of the Examiner's vul
garity and approve your defense of the great inventor. Very truly yours,
G. ALMAGIA, Editor L'ltalia.
The Examiner of yesterday has found ,
occasion to throw an abominable insult I
to some one, and this time the object of
its wrath and detestation is Guglielmo
Marconi, illustrious son of Italy, the
greatest genius of this eve of the twen- |
tieth century.
To satisfy a most wretched professional j
rivalry, this paper attempts to ridicule \
the name of the great inventor by "twist- !
ing" Marconi into "Macaroni."
To make the slur more complete, the ,
Examiner should have added, by the way, j
the title of "Dago"â that gentle epithet j
so common among the denizens of slums
and vile taverns.

Mayor Pheian Tells Why It Will Greatly
Benefit the Reading Public by Furnishing
the Best Literature and Means of In

To the Editor of the Call*. I heartily approve your plan for
an educational series by which those who are unable to procure books
will have the advantage of the best literature.
The modern newspaper has to some extent discouraged, by its,
voluminous presentation of the news of the day, the reading of good
literature. Some people are in the habit of reading the newspaper
and nothing else.
By introducing good literature into your columns you will sup
ply the public with the best mental pabulum without any cost and
thus perform a great educational service. Yours truly,

iggage, and he la now out of the
Republican party. The rebellion which
for wnks had been gaining strength
against him reached Its height last night,
ami the Mexican was repudiated absolute
ly by the convention wiii-jj met In Pioneer
Hall. The organization was delivered Into I
the hands of Kelly and ("rimmlns. and |

I tiling session of the cor.- ;
vention was a2i exciting one. In the con- j
fusion which attended the struggle for j
macy tiio convention failed to noml- j
nate a Recorder and a Coroner, but the
remainder of the ticket was filled.
After nominations had been made tho |
followers of Burns attempted to name the i
new county committee by resolution. Tho !
Joker was at mire seen, and after a bitter j
struggle the resolution was rejected and ;
the chairman, who Â»ls antagonistic to j
Burns, was empowered to name the !
county committee. He will announce his i
tlons on Monday.
When tho delegates saw that they had i
it In their power to punish Burns for his
treachery, they relented on his favorite, â¢
"William A. Deane, and nominated him
for County Clerk. The big light had been i
won and Burns was out of the organiza
tion.
Shortly after 8 o'clock the chairman.
Joseph K. Lee, b'!'"""d savagely upon tho
ites and 'â¢ailed the convention to
order. He positively declined to enter- '
trim 8 motion to change the order of busi- :
ness, refused to listen to an appeal from
his decision and asked for nominations
for Police Judges. His supreme contempt
for any suggestion but his own was re
freshing. Before nominations could be
made It was announced that Peter Ham
mond, the nominee of the convention for
County Clerk, had withdrawn and very â 
respectfully declined the honor. The
name of Charles Conlnn was also with
drawn as nominee for Police Judge.
While withdrawals were in order, Dr. T.
H. M'.rri.- was deprived of the nomination
for Coroner, which he had received the
evening before. Affairs were beginning
to simplify themselves and Henry I,
Joachlmsen was nominated unanimously
for Police Judge.
The most Important business of the ses
sion was then In order. It was the nomi
nation of Mayor. Whatever the members
of the convention may think or feel in
reference to their rivals within the party
they demonstrated last night that they
are of one mind on the vitally important
question of a standard he;trer. There was
but one candidate before the convention â
Horace Davis. He was placed In nomina
tion by W. S. Scott, who eloquently de
scribed the attributes of public and pri
vate life which qualify Mr. 1 avis for the
hik.-h office he seeks. Mr. Scott begged the
ntlon to give his candidate their
and their earnesi aid during the
campaign. Mr. Davis, he said, had won
honor in many walks of life. He could
gain no new ones In the position for which
he was named. He had come forth a
pe< pie's defender and at the persistent
â i if the city.
The speaker was frequently Interrupted
by enthusiastic applause, which ended
with a unanimous vote of nomination.
Three cheers and a tiger were given for
ihe nominee. In this affair at least the
Republicans were as a unit.
Nominations came now in rapid f-u~-
There were practically io con
and most of the nominees were
en by a unanimous vote. In rapid
ssion John Lackmann was nomi
nated for Sheriff, Albert Heyer for
Assessor, William A Deane for County
Clerk, Joseph H. Scott for Tax Collector,
Louis Feusier for Treasurer, John Farn- |
ham for Public Administrator, Charles H.
Jackson fur City and County Attorney,
A. P. Black for District Attorney ami
Charles A. Low for Police Judge.
When the name of Asa R. Wells was
presented for the nomination for Auditor,
T. B. O'Brien was on his feel with a pro
test. He declared that Wells had proved
himself a traitor to the men who had
nominated and elected him and should
now be punished. A roll call was de
manded and Wells received the nomina
tion with 5S votes against 21.
An effort was then made to nominate
John Hayes for Supervisor, but he was I
defeated. The following nominations of :
the other Republican convention for Su- I
pervisors were then indorsed: Nathan
Bibo, Charles Bliss, Major Charles Box
ton, Joseph Britton, Colonel Victor Du
boce, Samuel Foster, I). C. M. Godscll,
Thomas L. Henderson, W. C. Johnson,
Milo S. Jeffers, Charlea J. King. George
R. Sanderson, George T. Shaw, Dr. E. N.
Torello, William Watson. C. S. Wright, j
John ].. Kostei and Dr. T. H. Morris.
After the ballots had been taken for ;
Supervisors an effort was made to elect j
a Burns auditing committee. The effort
failed. An attempt was then made to!
elect a Burns. County Committee. It was j
denounced as a scheme of a. man who is i
charged with various crimes, and also ;
failed of success. The convention at this <
time v.as in an uproar and an adjourn
ment was taken to the call of the chair.
The chairman subsequently announced
the following committees: Purity com
mitteeâG. H. Pettio. John Rutherford,
Joseph King, Charles 11. Forbes and T.
H. Leib; committee on vacanciesâWil

SCEXKS were enacted at last night's
session of the Democratic Conven
tion, at Native Sons' Hall, that
rivaled in rowdyism the worst
brawls of the tenderloin. At one stage
of the disgraceful proceedings the police
were forced to take complete charge of
the convention to prevent bloodshed and
quell a threatened riot. No political
gathering ever held In this city could
erpinl the affair of last night. Aside from
being a display of the worst type of
hoodlumism It was a roaring farce as a
nominating body.
Jasper McDonald, the chairman, was at
no time In control of the mob excepting
during the few moments that Mayor
Phelan was on the platform thanking
the delegates for placing him in nomin
ation. Not the least semblance of order
was maintained. Delegations shouted
curses at delecatlons; the lobby hurled
epithets at the speakers, at the candi
dates and the chairman; outsiders voted
in place of absent delegates, and in the
midst of it all Mayor Phelan stood bo-
hind the wings directing^ his programme.
Efforts to break the slate were ineffec
tual, (jut- of the attempts all hut re- i
suited In a riot. This was on the con- )
test for County Clerk. Captain Dennis ;
Geary was the Mayor's candidate and
M. c. Hale} was pui In the light in j
! opposition. When Haley's case seemed
hopeless P. J. McCarthy jumped on
the platform and Jasper McDonald
yielded the gavel to him while he went
behind the scenes to confer with Mayor
Phelan.
McCarthy's appearance was the signal
| for a wild and most disgusting demonstra
tion of disapproval. His reception would
Indicate that he is far from the "whole
! thine" in the Democratic ranks. First
; there was a threatening hum, followed by
j a rumble, that grew in volume and
! viciousness. Encouraged by the number
of their sympathizers, the enemies of Mc-
Carthy grew bold and came out of cover.
Jim Neal was the leader, and he had his
! gang with him.
"You dirty dog! You dirty dog! Get :
1 down out of that! Pull him off of the
platform!" and similar insults were fired
at the temporary chairman by Neal and
his followers. McCarthy cast a glaiu-e at
the disturbing element and hissed be
tween his teeth some hot report.
Quick as a flash Neal elbowed his way i
; through the crowd at the side of the hall i
I and made a break for the platform. His |
; manner was menacing, and from the way
: In which he felt for his pistol pocket it
] was evident he meant business. With a
bound he was on the stage and at Mc-
Carthy. The secretaries attempted to i
throw him back on the floor, but with !
a swing he flung one of the men who mi
i terfered with him headlong into the saw
â  dust. McCarthy in the meantime was
'â â  keeping out of arm's reach of Neal and
; protecting himself from assault with the
i heavy gavel.
Sympathizers of both men caught the
1 spirit of the affair and rushed to the plat
; form to take a hand in the fight. Dele- I
! gates jumped over chairs and tore each
! other's clothing in a mad effort to join in
the fray.
In the midst of it all the police from
the galleries and the rear of the hall
rushed to the front with drawn clubs.
They were far outnumbered and for a
time while the battle raged the fiercest
it looked as if the bluecoats would be
overpowered, but by a mighty effort they
grabbed Neal just as he had drawn his
revolver and began to bustle him out of
the hall. There was a fierce struggle, but
six of the officers took hold of the bellig
erent and carried him kicking into the
street.
The Mayor at once sent a message to
Chief Lees to hurry all the police he could
spare to the convention hall. From that
time until adjournment the officers were
j almost as numerous as the delegates, but
i there were none too many to preserve the
j peace.
McCarthy tried to brave the crowd when
Neal was removed, but he was hooted off
the stage and took refuge behind the
wings, where he remained In peace until
R. Porter Ashe paid his compliments to
him before the convention; and with the
delegates' permission to address them he
called McCarthy a liar and defied him to
come out of his hiding place and face
him.
This Incident occurred -when the second
futile attempt was made to break the
elate. I^'Wls F. Byington had been placed
in nomination, and R. Porter Ashe was
called for. He also was named as a can
didate, and the delegate who placed him
In nomination asked him to step on the
platform and speak for himself. Ashe
was loaded with an inflammatory speech,
and for a time it looked as thousrh the
Neal-McCarthy turmoil would be re
peated.
"I call for P. H. McCarthy to come out
on this platform and face mo," were
Ashe's first words, but McCarthy failed
to come. Ashe then referred to an article
in an evening paper over McCarthy's sig
nature, and said the writer was a liar and
dared not refute it. Chairman McDonald
attempted to choke off the speaker and
the crowd broke Into a wild yell. A vote
was called for. It was close, and for a
moment the chairman hesitated In giving
his decision. "Treat me fair, chairman;
treat me fair," pleaded Ashe. and he was
allowed to proceed.
Chairman Jasper McDonald called the
convention tn order shortly after 9 o'clock.
As soon as quiet was restored Donzel
Btoney asked the chair for information
about a resolution which he was Interest
ed In, but Chairman McDonald was anx
ious to proceed with the regular order of
business and would not recognize Stoney's
appeal. Grattan D. Phillips then jumped
to his feet and asked that a resolution
pertaining to the Trades Council be read,
and after the secretary had read it It was
unanimously adopted. The resolution
pledged the Democratic candidates to em
ploy union labor.
J." Leo Parks then took the pla.tform and
read the following report of the commit
tee on resolutions:
The resolution submitted hy Mr. Brosnan is
covered by charter provisions and should be
loft to the new rity government in the dis
charge of its duties. We approve, however,
of the recommendation to have as murh pub
lic work as practicable done by day's labor
and that no man or firm have more than one
team employed in city work.
In reference to the resolution concerning the
Sanitary Reduction Works, we beg leave to
report that there Is a suit at present pending
against the holders of the fo-calied Sharon
franchise Involving the matters referred to in
said resolution, and the same has nnt yet
been Judicially determined. Should the de
i isiun of ilie courts be against such franchise.
we pledge "ur nominees to carefully investi
s.".tf> the matter and consider claims of indi
viduals and the public rights*.

GAGE IS OPPOSED TO
AN EXTRA SESSION
Is Convinced That Burns Could Not
Win the Senatorship.
The Governor Unburdens Himself and An
nounces That Be Will Not Accept Advice
to Drop the Mexican.
GOVERNOR GAGE has emerged
from an executive session with
himself and putting the gubernato
rial foot firmly down has an
nounced that there shall be no ex
tra session of the Legislature. The chief
reason for this official decision is that his
Excellency would, if possible, make him
self more ridiculous than he Is by calling
the legislators to a session that would be
unwarranted under the law. The sut
sidiary reason is that the Governor wishes
to inflict mild chastisement upon Bums
and show incidentally that the chief ex
ecutive of the State can, with difficulty,
think for himself. This does not mean,
however, that the Mexican has been al
together repudiated. He still has the favor
of Gage and perhaps the commission and
empty honor of a Senatorial appointment.
It was only after laborious deliberation
that Gage made his decision. Then he
conf.ded to some of those that are In his
confidence what he had done. He said
that it was out of the question legally to
call an extra session, and even if it were
possible Burns would gain nothing of
value. The Governor has discovered that
under the constitution he cannot call an
extra session of the Legislature simply
for the purpose of electing a United States
Senator. The call must declare that an
extraordinary emergency hae arisen and
that the welfare of the State demands
immediate legislation. No possible twist-
Ing of motives could make the election of
Dan Burns an element of State welfare
and the extra session will not be called.
There is absolutely nothing in the affairs
of the State upon which Gage can hinge
a call for an extra session.
More than this, the Governor has told
his friemls that he has a personal reason
for not calling the extra session. He is
laboring under an impression that he has
a character to lose and that Burns' dom
ination over him is creating an evil opin
ion of him. "My friends." he said to his
confidants, "are begging me to throw
Burns over. 1 certainly have proved my
loyalty to him, and it Is about time that
I paid a little attention to myself. I think
I need it. and besides Burns knows that
he cannot win the United States Senato*-
ship without me.
"Things have changed in the last year.
Men whom we could control several
months ago are now beyond our reach.
My patronage has all been practically dis
tributed and we have no strings now upon
! Democratic party of San Francisco can claim
i the chief responsibility, aims at making this
Uistinc tion by providing for municipal elections

therefore, be it
Resolved, By this, the first Democratic
municipal convention under the new charter
for the city and county of San Francisco, that
; It shall be the policy of the Detnooratle munlcl
pal organization of this city and county to
confine its municipal platorm and the deliber
ations of its municipal conventions to the dis
cussion of the principles of Democracy solely
in so far as they apply to municipal affairs.
Thomas Brosnan marched boldly up to
j the platform and asked to be heard. When
recognized by the chair he started to
speaK, but the gallery and lobby Invited
him to ascend the platform. He started
to climb over the footlights, and his action
aroused an uproar of laughter among the
j spectators, which continued during the
I time Brosnan occupied the stage. He
I peacefully folded his arms, smiled benevo
lently on "his audience and in a rich brogue
said, "Gintlemin." That was as far as he
got for the time being, as the cheering
and laughter were incessant. Delegate
Coffey tried to cut Brosnan off with a
point of order by saying that the resolu
: tion which Brosnan was trying to present
to the convention had been referred to its
proper committee. Chairman McDonald
sustained the point, but Brosnan refused
to retreat until he had had his say. J. Leo
Park, seeing that a speech from the re-
I calcitrant delegate was inevitable, moved
that the order of business be dispensed
with and this motion prevailed.' Attorney
Van "Wycke, who had been recognized by
' the chair, gracefully yielded to the mem
! ber from the Twenty-ninth District. In
i involved sentences Brosnan attempted to
tell of his search for the committee. He
told of his visit to the California Hotel
' and of his subsequent attempt to meet
! Mayor Phelan. Cheers greeted the speak
er every time he opened his mouth, and he
blushed like a schoolgirl. He said he met
the Mayor in a restaurant and he told
him something, but what it was was lost
' in the shouts of laughter that greeted his
! pathetic efforts to be understood. A few
I more points of order were made, but no
I ruling of the chair would budge Mr. Bros
i nan and two husky sergeants-at-arms
j had to forcibly escort ht.m off the stage.
i Delegate Van Wyek was next to be
; heard, but the crowd was in such good
humor that it had fun with him.
Van Wycke called attention to the fact
I that the resolution had two meanings
: and straddled the question ns to whether
' th? convention should adopt the Chicago
platform of 1896. He aroused applause by
saying he voted for Bryan and asked
i that there be no two ways about it, but
that the convention should adopt it in a
manly way. Delegate Denman was in
favor of adopting the resolutions as a
whole. He said he was a member of
the committee and then went on to ex-
I plain the resolutions.
I ClitU3 Barbour was next recognized
the men we held In line before. lam con
vinced that Burns cannot now control the
votes he had at the late session of the
Legislature, and he would make a sorry
figure of himself at an extra session.
"But still 1 have not yet decided to
throw Burns overboard. He is a heavy
weight for me to carry, and if I were to
follow the advice of my friends from the
south I would discard him. 1 have given
more perhaps than he deserves and I
will not call an extra Besslon for him."
"But what arc you going to do?" asked
the Governor's confidants.
"I am going to wait until the opening of
Congress," was Gage's reply. * r I believe
that Matt Quay will be seated, and when
he is Burns' path will be clear. I intend
to appoint him formally just before the
opening of Congress and then he must let
events take their course. I would ap
point him now, only I am tired of the
howls that have been raised against my
administration and don't want any more."
Gage also left the Impression from his
conversation that Burns already had the
commission and was simply waiting for
an opportune time to spring It upon the
public. There should not be any great
congratulation over the announced plans
of the Governor. He has the remarkable
faculty of changing his mind wn v the
same facility that a weather vane moves
to the wind, and what he thinks to-day
may not be what he thinks to-morrow.
BURNS SAYS OTHERWISE.
Assures His Friends That a
bession Will Be Called.
D. M. Burns talks on the quiet to mem
| bers of the Legislature as if the pro
gramme for an extra session is certain to
be carried out. Last week the Mexican
had an extended interview with a promi
nent member of the Legislature. The
lawmaker, after listening for some time
and perceiving that the Mexican was
taking soundings, decided to call up the
main question. Accordingly he asked,
"Will there be an extra session?" The
colonel promptly replied, "Yes." After
reflecting for a moment he added, "I am
informed that Governor Gage is in favor
of calling the members together in special
session."
Burns was asked by the inquisitive leg
islator if the people favored the extra
session. The Mexican was not at a loss
for a reply. He said the people in some
sections of the State were very anxious
that river Improvement and reclamation
work should be carried on, but that legis
lation was necessary to further progress.
Warming up to the subject, the colonel
gave his views on appropriations and the
tax levy, intimating that the extra ses
sion might reduce the tax levy. He re
marked that the tax levy bill which was
passed at the regular session contem
plated the payment of all the appropria
tions allowed by the Legislature, but
claimed that the levy was excessive, as
the Governor had retired many of the
bills which passed both houses, and there
fore it would not be necessary to raise as
much money as the tax levy contemplated.
The member of the Legislature to whom
the argument was addressed knew that
the colonel was floundering, but did not
go to his rescue. The legislator was fa
miliar with the fact that the revenue bill
which passed both houses directed the
State Board of Kqualization to levy a tax
sufficient to raise a certain amount of
money for the several funds for each
fiscal year and that the extra session
could not tamper with the levy after the
State Board had lixed the rate and the
valuation.
The member of the Legislature, who
had listened without saying much to
the gilt-lined palaver of the Mexican,
finally plumped the question, "How much
notice will you give us of the session,
bo we can fix our affairs to go to Sacra
mento?"
Speaking* of the time limit, the colonel
reminded his small but intelligent audi
ence that Governor Stoneman once con
vened an extra session in this State on
three days' notice to the members and
that Governor Roosevelt of New York in
a recent call for an extra gathering of
the lawmakers of that State allowed only
three days for preparation. The Mexican,
however, fancied that Governor Gage
would be more considerate and allow
more extended notice of the proposed
event. The colonel bluntly said, "We will
give you fellows a week's time to get
ready."
Becoming enamored of his own voice,
the colonel proceeded to touch upon topics
pertaining to the Senatorship, and epoke
of President MeKinley's regret that Cali
fornia had not chosen a Senator to suc
ceed Mr. White. The Mexican professed
to have information to the effect that
! Senator Carter was authorized to Bpeak
I for the President and that the Montana
Senator was strongly In favor of an extra
session. According to Burns' view of the
situation. Carter had succeeded in recon
ciling many of the elements which had
been antagonistic to an extra session of
the Legislature.
I and ascended the platform. His small
j stature and statesmanlike way of hold
' ing his right arm in his bosom was an
incentive to the gallery and lobby to have
fun with him. What he said was not
heard by the delegates, but Barbour
i would not withdraw. Matthew Kelleher
â  of the Thirty-fourth District jumped out
j of his seat and yelled that he hoped the
I chairman would preserve order and fol
lowed this up with the statement that
' "we ought to have the Governor down
here to investigate this matter." This
wild remark delivered by the delegate
| started the boisterous laughter again.
| Barbour in trying to continue yelled:
"You can't rattle me, boys," and a man
in the lobby yelled, "Go ahead, Dewey."
Despite the fact thr.t points of order and
the noise kept Chairman McDonald in a
fever heat, rapping for order and trying
Ito answer Questions on the advice or
Barbour and Secretary Hlckey, the
speaker continued, his remarks being
punctuated with shouts and cheers: "Wo
j are told very correctly ( â¢Hurray') â I am
beginning to think I am in a Democratic
convention. ('Hurray.') In the lan
guage of Colonel Burns ('Hurray') the
situation Is beautiful. ('Hurray/) The
Republican candidate for Mayor told his
constituents last night that the election
this fall would have an influence on the
election that would take place next
year." Cries of "Hurray" and "Sit down"
I greeted this announcement and when a
delegate rose to a point of order the ex
cited speaker inelegantly invited him to
sit on it. Seeing that he could not pro
ceed, Barbour retired to his seat. The
| previous question being called for, the
j motion to adopt the resolutions was put
and they were adopted.
Chairman McDonald then announced to
the convention that Mayor Phelan was
ready to address the delegates, and amid
the cheers of his constituents the Mayor
took the stage and with great rapidity
said:
"Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the
Convention: I am not here now to make
a speech as you have Important work be
fore you and the only thing that is in my
mind is simply to return thanks for the
honor, the very great honor, which you
have conferred upon me. (Applause.) I

that led to the formation of the conven

The schooner Charles Levl Woodbury,
which arrived from Kodlak â  --.. â¢ day
with ninety-nine barrels of salmon, had
a narrow escape from total destruction
on the Alaskan coast. During a storm
tlio was driven ashore and it was only
after some hard work that Captain Faf
man and his crew grot her off. Then she
proved to be In very tÂ«ul shape and leak
ing. It was only by working night and
day that the crew succeeded In keeping
her afloat until they reached Sand i'olnt,
where she was beached. An examination
showed the hull to be badly injured. A
lartje portion of the keel was gone and
the planking w.s . aten into by the rocks,
In Bomo places a? deep as tour Inches.
The tide did not run out far enough to
permit of 1 1 pairs being made and I lap
tain Fa I man v.-. about to abandon the
schooner when she little steamer Kodat
hove In sitrht. .-aji arrangement was en
tered Into and the Kodat towed the Wood
bury to Wood L'Tland, where she was
fixed up in such shape as to be able to
r<-smne her journey. On the way down
she till leaked a little and e'verv now
and then the crerw had to take a spell at
the pumps in order to keep the water
down. The "Woodhury will go on the dry
dock as soon ... she Is discharged.
There is some anxiety over the little
steamer Discovery, now overdue at Beat
tle. â  : 'i' 1 was caught in the storm of Sep
tember 10-n that did so much damage on
the Alaskan coast, and her passengers
and crew never expected she would live
through. Dr. Stone, who arrived here on
the Thetis, was aboard the Discovery,
and be says he never experienced such
weather. For twenty-four hours he was
hanging with might and main to a stan
chion, and when Dutch Harbor was
reached he left the vessel with a sigh of
relief. The revenue cutter was without
ii surgeon, and the officers were as glad
of Dr. Stone's company as he was of the
chance to !_"Â»t to San Francisco Tho
doctor expected to hear that the Discov
ery was on the Sound, but her arrival
has not been reported, so he is growing
anxious.
The Postal Telegraph Company blames
the raft for the breaking of its cable
across the bay. The towing chain of the
big derelict was dragging along the bot
tom, and it is supposed to have parted
the cable. It will cost about $1000 to re
pair the break and the cable company
will expect the owners of the raft to pay
that amount.
The repairs to lightship 70 are com
pleted, and to-day her compasses will be
adjusted on the bay. On Sunday she will
go out to her station on the bar and the
Madrono will come In.
The steamer South Portland Is being

she was moved to the Union Iron Works
She is now on the drydock being cleaned

SHIP PYTHOMENE STORM-TOSSED OFF CAPE HORN.
THE British ship Pythomene, now discharging at Selby's, had a very rough voyage to this port. She left New
on-Tyne October 1 and made lair weather of it to the Horn. <>n May S and 1" a storm was encountered
that carried away a number of th sails, sprung the main topmast and tore out the cranes of the lower topsail
yard. An attempt was mad- to put into the Falkland Islands, but it failed, so the captain ran for Montevideo.
Repairs were made at that port, and on .June 24 the vessel Bailed again. On September 3 she was caught In another
storm, which started the bulwark stanchions and carried away the main toiamast backstay and chain nlates.
PROGRESS IN REAL ESTATE.
THERE is a de< ld< dly ch< erful feel
ing prevailing among dealers i. i
â  ' ft mar
ket Is ample justification for this
â¢â¢ . less. Everything points to
an unusually prosperous fall season.
Th< re is a growing Inquiry for g 1 In
ment properties, and a number of big
sales are now being negotiated. During
the last week several sale: have been
made representing many thousands of
dollars, in addition to a large number of.
smaller i nes. The property on the south
r of Post and .Tones Bti
owned by the Wickersham estate, has
been sold for $27,000, and the Hermann
rty on the corner of Fourth and Mls-
I for something
in the neighborhood of $65,000 or }~
but the deeds have not been recorded,
and the names of the purchasers are be
ing withheld until the examination of the
.mpieted.
Yon Rhein i* Co. recently sold at public

â  SI kton ami I'.<st streets. 80x46:5,

â  - $67,500, t.i D. L. Randolph.
The sale was made subject to the ap
proval of the executors and the probate
court. The executors were dissatisfied
with the price obtained, and negotiations
were continued, with the result that Yon
Kh. In & Co. have obtained a bid from At
.â¢ Arthur Rodgera of $72,500, which
will bi submitted to the proi ite c urt for
approval. It Is likely that the bid will bt

The Real Estate Circular, published by
Thomas Magee <t Sons, says:
The decided change for the better that â â¢â¢â â¢â 
have been looking tor in the real estate mar
ket with the advent of the fall season scorns
to have set In. Some five large Bales of
business properties have been made, and three
or four others are close to consummation from
offers already made. Dozens of buyers have
for a long time been on the point of buying,
but the long dullness and the fact that the
crowd was not buying kept them back. At
present it seems likely that there will be a
movement along the whole line, both of first
and second class business properties, and of first
and second class dwelling real estate. Good
times ore upon us, both in commercial busi
ness and among mechanics and laborers. As
one of ciur oldest builders said to us last
month, every man who wants to work can now
easily got work.
The total number of sales made In August
was 228, of the value Of $1.310. the number
of ulei recorded In September as 239, ag
gregating $976,841. Far more Bales were made
In September than in August, but the tit!.
are still under examination, they therefore
havo net yet 1 een recorded.
O. H. UrabÃen & Co.'s Real Estate Rec
ord says:
Business property la much In demand. The
very choice locations are, however, ho strongly
held that investors are commencing to extend
their views and realty Is now nought which a
few months ago was only regarded as an alter
native. As was to be expected September shows
a healthy Increase in the volume of business
over August. The greatest Increase In the
amount of purchases has been In the Western
Addition, where the sales have me up from
$288,214 to $462,000. Mission property bus also
been more sought after, the transactions in that
district having increased from $43,575 to $134,400,
while the 100-vara district hag slightly im
proved. The records for September show a. fall
ing off in Investments in the 50-vara district,
but several transactions have been consum
mated, but not yet filed, which will bring up
the amount during the present month. The
outlook for the remainder of the autumn Is
promising, and If the hoped for rains fall this
winter a permanent market may be anticipated
next spring.
The excess of loans over repayments during
last month was Â£210,64!. Nearly half of this
gain was made by Individuals and the Illbernla
Hank. In the case of the first named it was
$00,482 and in the Instance of the savings in
stitution it was $42,171. Among other banks
which showed an excess of mortgages over re
leases were the Savings Union, the Savings
and Loan Society, the Security and the French
banks. Among the larger Institutions the Or
man Bank recorded 18723 more in repayments
than In loans.

ring Hip Sing a::d Young Wall tongs.
Over thirty shots wore tired, and abuut
a dozen Celestials, evenly divided, partici
pated. No one was* hit, but there were
several narrow escapes. These shooting
scrapes break out spasmodically about
once a month.
It is said to-day's battle resulted from
an attempt of Young Wan highbinders to
assassinate Charley Sing, a member of
the r:vai company. Three arrests were
made. Charley Sing and Sing Duck,
members of the Hip Sing Society, have
been arrested on a charge of assault to
murder. Sing Duck of the Young Wahs
was also tailed. Other warrants have
been issued.
The Chinatown in this city Is becoming
notorious; for its lawlessness, and a
couple of weeks ago the Chinese Consul
at San Francisco appealed to Mayor Mar
tin to preserve order among his subjects.
(if late many hatchet men from San Fran
cisco, and other towns have gathered here,
and many shooting scrapes and ab
ductions of Chinese women have resulted.
Yesterday Chief of Police Kidward
called a meeting of the Chinese merchants
and warned them that they must see that
order Is preserved In their quarter. He
has also given strict orders that gambling
of all kinds among the Chinese must
cease.

[LETTER TO 11*5. rINKIfAM NO. 41,207]
" Dear FiiiF.xi) â A year ago I was a
great sufferer from female weakness.
My head ached all the time and I would
get so dizzy and have that all gone
feeling in the stomach and was so
nervous and restless that I did not
know what to do with myself.
" My food did me no good and I had a
bad case of whites. I wrote to you and
after taking 1 Lydia E. Pinkham's Vege-
table Compound as directed, I can
truly say that I feel like a new woman
and cannot tell you how grateful I am
to you.
"I have recommended it to all my
friends and have given it to my
daughter â¢ho is now getting along
splendidly. May you live many years
to help our suffering' sisters." â Mrs. C.
Carpexteb, 253 Grand St., Brooklyn,
N. Y.
Over eighty thousand
such letters as this were re-
ceived by Mrs. Pinkham
during 1897. Surely this is
strong proof of her ability
to help suffering women.

The beautiful palace of art looked its
best for the occasion and its brilliant
lights throw into splondid relief the hun
dreds of paintings on the walls and the
groupings of greens added to the tropi
cal aspect of the welcome. A large num
ber of invitations had been sent out, and
Judging from the aba Â»lute jam, none
wore unheeded. There wore few late
comers and every room In the great
building: was crowded. In the east sal
lery overlooking: the main exhibition
room, where the formal welcome was
to be extended, was stationed .in orches
tra under the direction of Henry Hey
man, who, for the honor of the institute
and the university, had arranged a par
ticularly attractive programme!
At - o'clock promptly President and
Mrs. Wheeler, escorted by General \V. 11.
L. Barnes, entered. They proceeded to
one of the anterooms of the salon, where
they received the greetings of many. Mrs.
Phebe Hearst arrived a few momenta
later and joined them. The scene at this
time and for three hours following was
as animated as any ever witnessed within
the four walls of the institution. College
boys ami girls were everywhere, the
young ladies looking particularly lovely
and the young men brimming over with
the spirit of the occasion. In and out,
upstairs and down; there was a constant
movement, with the one desire to get a
glimpse of the new president and his wife
ere the formal exorcises brgau. Even
then man;' were not afforded the oppor
tunity, ;i! V Â£ough all enjoyed it later.
A low d^.is had been raised at the west
end of the main exhibition hall and the
space in front of this was packed so solia
that, when a burst nf applause indicated
to those In other parts of the room nd of
the building that the honored party had
entered, it was impossible to see" their
faces. General Barnes arose like Neptune
from the midst of this sea of millinery,
broadcloth and shirtfronts with the hope
that they could see him. when he must
have known that they really came to hear
him.
"I don't know,'.' he said, "whether I was
brought here as one of the boys or as
one of the old men looking: down from
the cold h<-ifrht of a vanished generation,
but at all events 1 am the baby of the
regents and perhaps it is just ;ls well that
out of the mouth of this regent babe
should come a welcome to our baby presi
dent."
This sally, it goes without saying, was
received with prolonged applause. Gen
eral Barees continued:
You can have little idea, ladies and gen
tlemen and students, of the pains we were
at a.-; a hoard to select a president of this I
â  growing university, the center of the in- {
telligence and intellectual progress and cul
ture ' f the great empire of the West.
Probably no duty more solemn was ever
imposed upon an equal numV>er of men in
terested in educational matters. A list of
names was presented containing thus? of
men â¢i!s-tini;uishcd In literature. In science
an.:l in the marvelous artâ never yet fully
learned, I believeâ of governing; a univer
sity, and when at last Professor Benja
min Ide Wheeler of Cornell was selected for
that hich function we thought that. In
deed, we deserved well oÂ£ the present and
well of the future.
Â«Jur new president comes to us as we
stanJ at the gateway of a new century.
Whatever has been accomplished in the
past is but a faint glimmering <>f the days
that shall be% Science is at the threshold,
art :s in the birth of the exquisite archi
tectural dream that we liave seen come
to us through the splendid g-enerosity of
that blessed mother of the young who loVe
to learn. Mrs. Hearst.
In conclusion, turning to the president,
General Barnes said:
President Wheeler, we are proud to have
you here. We know that you will adminis
ter the great duties imposed upon you as
they should be administered, and, on behalf
of the 1 sard of regents, I saj- to you that
our hands are clasped in yours and what- i
ever you may need of sympathy, of friend
ship nml cordial, untiring support will be
plven you by every member of that board
that, to-day, loves and respeots you, sir.
\V. M. Martin. '00, delivered the wel
come, on the part of the student body,
pledging to the new president their fealty
and co-operation for the success of the
university. Professor C. M. i iayley per- i
formed a similar service for the faculty,
pointing out with much humor some of the
things he. hoped the new president miÂ«ht
do for tn* students, the faculty and tho
university at large. The curtailment of
"joshes" "and the securing of money with
which to carry on the plans of Mrs.
Hearst were among these wants.
President v. :. . ler'a response to all these
welcomes was heartfelt and characteristic
of the man Callfornians are rapidly com
ing to know, lie said in part:
I hardly know what I shall pay. I have
heard about the generosity of the Califor
nia welcome, but I have never felt it so
fully beforp â the Ir.rcent, heartiest welcome
that a man ev< r had. I feel It all around
me. It's In the air. You are too good.
POSTUM CEREAL.
COFFEE HEART.
Many People Think They Have Heart
Disease.
"My husband and I used to drink
Mocha and Java coffee at 40 cents a
pound. made it strong and always
had it for breakfast; sometimes in cold
weather for luncheon and dinner. A
form if heart disease came on to both
of us. Husband complained of his
heart missing a beat sometimes, and
that he could not sleep after drinking
coffee for the 6 o'clock dinner. I had
pains at the heart, and very peculiar
smothering sensations, frequently ac-
companied With sick headache. My
physician forbid the use of coffee, and
we were put on Postum Food Coffee,
with the result that both husband and
myself have fully regained our health
and our hearts are all right and perfect
now.
"I have reached such perfection in
making Postum that husband cannot
tell either by look or taste whether he
la drinking fine coffee or Postum, and
he is a connoisseur in coffee. We drink
Postum two or three times a day and
it never palls on our -taste.
"A good many people make Postum
in a very slipshod manner; that is, they
dash a little into the coffee pot and let
it bubble up a little while and serve it,
but that makes the flattest kind of a
drink. On the contrary, when four
heaping teaspoons to the pint of water
are used and the Postum allowed to boil
fully fifteen minutes after the boiling
begins (not counting after it is put on
the stove, but after the real boiling be-
gins), then one obtains a beverage that
is worth while.
"I have no objections to your using
my name."â Mrs. J. M. Courtright, 800
Third street, S.. Minneapolis, Minn.
Postum is Bold by all first-class gro. j
I am hens to do the best 1 can. but I
know very well what are my limitations.
There are siimo things I can do nr I some
I cannot. General Barnes, I thank you
fnÂ«m the bottom of my heart for the as
surances which you bring me of the cordial
support of the governing board. Professor
Oayley, I thank you for the assurances you
liavo given me of the work you have laid
out for me. There la a lot to be done here.
I came into California last Saturday, tired
out. I besfan Monday morning with a ner
vous headache find for four days the work
BtÂ«>w and I have been feeling better every
hour. [feel better now than I ever felt.
I begin to be bo much at home with your
welcome and good cheer and healthiness
that I begin to regret a trip East 1 have
lnlil out fur January. I don't believe I can
begin to make UDimy mind to go out of
the sunshine Into the dark so soon. And,
Mr. Martin. I thar.k you for th assur
ances! you give me of the feelinn of the
students. I know that we will be friends.

PENIEL MISSION GIRL TO
TALK IN ARAB COSTUME
Miss Mary Lyons, for eighteen months
past one of the two workers in the Penicl
Mission at Port Said. Egypt, among the
Ar;ibs. will tell about that work at the
Sunday afternoon meeting at the Peniel
Hall, 19 Third street, and will wear the
Arab costume, which she uses when
working among the natives.
Miss Lyons Is the only one of all the
Peni< 1 workers, either in the home or
foreign fields, who did not have some
preliminary training here in California.
She was born on Mount Zion, Jerusalem,
her father being the British Consul at
that place and her grandfather was a
Jewish rabbi. She became interested in
the work through meeting Miss Van-
Bant; one of the Port Said workers, on
the latter' s visit while sick to Jerusalem
and. later leaving home and friends,
joined her at Port Said and entered the
work.
Some weeks ago she started with Miss
Vansant, who was in very feeble health,
for the latter's home at Salt Lake. The
latter died at sea on the way me
and Mis:- Lyons brought the body on to
Salt Lake, and then extended her visit
to this coast, the home of the Peniel
Mission work. The meeting will begin
at 3 p. m. and promises to provo very
interesting.
ALP WHEELAN
"MAKES OVER"
"THE MIKADO."
KO-KO has traveled from coasl to
coast, and theatergoers have
deemed him worn threadbare. But
now comes Alf Wheelan, If you
Lse, and he dresses him in
brand new Japanese glints and
glitters, and hless us if there isn't a really
i truly hit at the Tivoll.
If there was a man in all that warm,
smoky, chuckling audience who thought
"The Mikado" an old opera while Alt'
Wheelan was on the stage, then he kept
so rtill about it that nobody knew he was
there. He wasn't worth noticing, any
way. Meanwhile Wheelan continued to be
funny, as the gods grant that only half a
dozen nun in a San Francisco season shall
be.
It was his hands that made the hit.
They are long, twining things, with as
many expressions as his face. They crawl
sinuously when he pleads, and they
clutch, demon-like. th< next minute, and
again they Bap and flutter. Always they
are wraitnlike and bewildering. When
New STork unco discovers those hands it
will be a far cry to Frisco
The Tivoll chorus is looking- a bit weary
days. The new Bcores pile up bo
ne upon another that the snap Isn't
there. They appear to find "The Mill
a very old opera and hardly worth the
singing. Given a chance, they would make ;
the audience think bo too, but the princi
pals take matters out of th'-ir bands.
Ni'ii^ of the principals are poor. What
Ada Palmer Walker lacks in voice she
makes up In flirtation, and what Tom
tacks of the histrionic he make?
up in contagious good nature. He has
brought a right round little voice, t o,
with bis Eastern outfitâ a voii c that
.lit. to save your neck, think of
apart from the chubbiness and the
cnerubness of him.
Besides all these, William Schuster tow
ers pufflly if Poo'-Bah, and Julia I
has a little success all her own a? she tod
snugglee through the part of
Pitti-Sing. Han Francisco worships at the
shrine of grand opera, of course, butâ
well, it gives one a sort of homey feeling
ese Tivoli people in their own
country once more.

Martin Carter Appears.
Martin Carter appeared before Judge
Troutt yesterday in answer to an order
to show cause why he should not be re
moved as the executor of the will of the
late Thomas Carter. It is charged that
Martin Carter failed to include various
erties belonging to the estate of
Thomas Carter in his inventory, and was
lly withholding them. Yesterday
he presented deeds to the properties in
question, which were drawn a few days
prior to his brother's death, and also a
i ... â¢â¢ to decedent'! Interest in the
carbuflding business at Newark. Martin

even If he survived his illness he would
not want the properties back. Tho exam

bills at Twentieth and Illinois Btreets, had
his case dismissed by Judge Mo^an yes

that the handbill did not come within the
scope of the ordinance which was aimed
against advertising.

EASTERN MARKETS
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Oct. -With the exception of
some profit-taking salfs in the last hour of
to-day's market the movement of prices was
upward almost without Interruption. The de
mand was not larg at any time, but the sup
ply of stocks proved small, however, at the
higher prices, except in a few eases, notably
Bouthern Pacific, which met large offerings at
28. The late break was led by Brooklyn
Transit, which was pressed down under a
flood of offerings to 87, an extreme decline of
3%. The profit-taking, which was induced by
this weakness, was most conspicuous in sugar
and tobacco, which lost neariy 2 points each
of the extreme advance. The initial impulse
to the rise came from London, where the
easier money conditions and a hope of a
peaceful ttlement of the Transvaal difficulty
induced large covering by the bears In all de
partments. London bought stocks here to the
extent of upward of 2S.<ioo shares and showed
a special â  sire for Louisville, which led the
active railroad list with a net advance of I*4
after an extreme rise of 2 points. The maxi
â¢ mum rate for call money was 8 per cent to
day, against 12 per cent yesterday and 20 per
cent the day before. The rate fell to 4 per
cent In the late dealings.
This progr â¢ decline In money rate was
en Important element in the strength of
stocks and has awakened expectations of a
good bank statement to-morrow. The expec
tation seems to be based on the fact, that the
bunks are known to have received 12,000,000 in '
gold on account of postofflce i. â¢<â â¢â¢!;. from
Cuba, and drafts from the San Francisco Mint
on account of the Klondike gold deposited
there. The gold engaged lasÂ« week in Lon
don also figured In the consideration of spec
ulators, although it will not be received until
to-morrow and will not Dgure in to-morrow's
bank statement. As a matter of fact the
New Fork banks have lost on the interior
movement so far as known movements are
concerned about $3,000,000. Operations at the
sub-t.r. indicate a further loss by the
banks of 12,608,000.
Allowing tor the $2,000,000 gold received the
net loss in cash to the banks seems to be
upward of 13,500,000. The result may be com
plicated by the effect of money spent here by
visitors to the Dewey celebration, which is
an unknown quantity. The easier rates for
money are largely due to offerings on ac
count of outside banks, which will be of no
advantage to the New York banks in their
weekly showing. The relaxation in London
discount rates to-day resulted in a decline
In sterling exchange at Paris and Berlin. In
strong contrast was the sharp advance in
sterling exchange rate here. This is said to
be due to covering by exchange bankers who
have sold bills in anticipation of a large out
ward movement of cotton and grain. The
chartering of a large number of vessels by the
British Government to transport troops anil
the resulting rise in rates for shipping awak
ened a fear that shipping of merchandise may
be hampered.
The bond market continued firm, but the
movement In prices was upward. Total sales
par value, $1,550,000.

Bradstrcet's Financial Review.
NEW York, Oct. B.â Bradstreet'j to-morrow
will Bay of th.- New JTork stock market: The
attention of Wall street was mainly devoted to
the question of money. The extreme rates for
of 2i to 40 per cent recorded on Monday
ami Tuesday lnst were unnecessary. In fact,
Uure has been some discuss! >n as to whether
puch r?;ures were not the? result of manipula
tion. Yet it is evident from th- bank state
nii nt published Thursday, September 2S, just
â¢ the market entered on the twr> days'
recess for the Dewey reception, as well as from
the known n.oviment of money to the interior,
that the banks were still losing cash and were
. d to ortiact the v..lume of their call
loans to the street. Tax payments in New Y"rk
City anJ other October disbursements also
-itated an extra amount of disturbance of
loans and there consequently was not a little
ire resulting in many borrowers being
â¢ to ijay from 10 to 15 per cent for ac
cumulations, while 6 to 10 per cent was the
easiest terms obtainable. Nevertheless the
market becames less disturbed as the balances
were readjust. >d, and by Thursday 1" per cent
wa,Â« the extreme tor the time loan market and
lenders with unemployed balances had to be
â¢ mient to accept 3 to r, per cent at the end of
the day, and on Friday the extremes were 5 to
8 per cent. Both the money and stork markets
have been to some extent influenced by the
rise in the Bank of England rate to *> per cent
which with the flrmne.-s of the London open
money market and the financial pressure which
Is shown in Germany rendered further Imme
diate importations of (fold improbable, if not
impossible. Relief from this source beinp cut
off, discussion of the domestic financial sltua
:im floes not develop slrns favorable to the
re-lorstlon of the decided ease In the New
York loan market. The activity of trade and
the l lVbuerlty of the country, it is held, will
keep money in circulation during the autumn
and early winter, when, under ordinary cir
cumstances It would begin to return to New
York as soon as the crop movement was well
under way. It, therefore, seems that the stock
market must resifcn itself to a high if not a
stringent money market. In which 6 per cent
WIH be the minimum for both call nnd time
loans. In spite of this tendency and of the
disposition of professional traders to press the
market for sales, prices have behaved well, and
after a pretty general, though far from severe,
decline in the early part of the week, a dull,
irregular recovery set In on Wednesday. This
v.ns partly In sympathy with the improve
ment at London. It was, however, noticeable
that most of the purchasing here was by the
bears, and represented the covering of their
Ehort contracts. In fact, one of the features of
the week was the failure of the high money
market to provide any appreciable liquidation
if li-rng stock. Meantime apart from the dearer
money nmrket nearly all the circumstances
benrinc on stock value* continue to be favor
able, and this activity and prosperity of trade
naturally crealp a certain feeling of confidence
in the future of the market.
The volume of trading fn r the week has been
KniMller thaji usual, and the international yacht
rai c has diverted the attention of a conslder
able section of the Wall-street professional
element from the market. On Friday the mar
ket developed a prood deal of strength on fur
ther favorable influence and from London.

will say: Distributive trade, while smaller at

Industry Is active, railway earnings heavy,

Increase, while failures lessen. Pall festivals

had an appreciable effect upon retail and

are fewer and less costly than in most years
Though lessened by holidays, bank clearings'
swelled partly by heavy October disbursements
and partly by general business expansion, tend
to enlaree as thÂ« season advances. Business
failures are apparently at a minimum and lia
bilities are certainly less costly than for many
years oast. Prices as a whole manifest ag
gressive strength. Farm products are especially
prominent In this direction, the Souths great

weekly review of trade will say:
The grand demonstration ln honor of Admiral
Dewey effectually stopped business of most
kinds for two days at the chief city of the
country and yet the remaining transactions of
the week would have excited wonder a year
ago. At New York, where the interruption was
greatest, payment through clearing-houses ex
j ceeded 000,000 in four business days, a
i record never before approached, and outside
I New York the gain reflects a great expansion
, in the volume of that kind of business which
does not depend on exchanges. It has been a
1 week of remarkable monetary changes here and
: elsewhere. The Bank of England raised Its
I rate 1 per cent before and a half more after
! Its weekly statement, from 3% to 6 per cent,
with the hope that the outgo to New York
might be checked, but the Bank of Germany
lost also.
Germany lost also and raised its rate to 6 i
per cent and the Bank of France lost heavily.
While high rates were paid here for money
required in speculation no stringency embar- I
rassed any branch of legitimate business and j
the stock market has held up surprisingly. With I
Bucn business as the great steel companies are
doing It Is not strange that their stocks are i
firmly held. There have been heavy sales of !
rails deliverable next year, $33 being fixed as
the price after consultation, and about 250.0<XJ
tons, fairly divided between Eastern and West
ern works, were sold. For their protection the
great companies bought billets in large quan
tities, for which It is said $35 was paid by some,
and of Bessemer pl nearly 2C0.000 tons, the
Federal Steel Company taking 110,000 and Pitts
burg works taking advantage of old options,
Other large rail contracts are expected soon,
especially those of the Pennsylvania. Plate
Works seem to be gaining little If any on their
I orders and bar mills are crowded as ever, while
; the renewal of efforts for consolidation of sheet
i mills causes more active buying. But while j
; uessemer ing rose 26 cents ami greyforge at ;
' 1 Ittsburg declined 50 cents, finished products
! were not changed, excepting another rise of 15 i
; cents per keg in cut nails, and there is reported
i some disposition to hold back orders because
I cf J he general rise in prices.
'in l. 'IV,'""' market Is strong with sales of
lu,MtZ,loZ pounds at three markets, prices being
! maintained, although the advance at Lomion
! has been checked.
After advancing about 2 cents, wheat declined
sharply, uncertainty In the Transvaal being
1 used by speculators as excuse for the fluctua
i tion. The closing price is unchanged with At
lantic exports of 3.562,062 bushels, flour Included
a ?^i nl 2 Z : 884033 last year - and Pacific exports
of 397,502 bushels, against 702,414 last year. With
it 18 noted that corn exports were also 2 992 232 i
bushels tor the week, against 2,631,002 last year
the [.rice rising ! cent. It seems not strange ;
j that wheat continues firm and Western receipts .

against 10,539.359 last year. I

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, Oct. âWheat was weak at the
opening. Liverpool failed to show the ad
vance expected in view of the war rumors and !
the effect was discouraging to the bulls. The
! market opened %c under yesterday's close;
: December at 73V/73-V. and May at 76Vi@
76% C. Reports of large Argentine shipments
were also an influence tending to weaken the
I market. An Increase of 1,200,000 bushels in
I the stocks at Minneapolis and Duluth was re
; ported and Snow In his report estimated the
j crop of wheat at 564,0110,000, considerably over
the Government estimate. With these items
j before them the longs began to unload and
j prices declined. St. Louis for some time had
; been a strong support of the local market,
but let go a long line. Important liquidation
was done by local and other outsiders. De
! cember declined to 72Vic. There was some
covering by shorts against puts, causing a
reaction In December to 72% c, but the liqui
dation was too general for the market to
stand up under and December again declined '
to 72^4@72%c, at which it closed. May wheat !
I ranged at 75%@75>*c to 7GV4@76%c and closed
I at 7f,'ic.
! Corn was strong and higher early. In sym
| pathy with the Liverpool advance of %c. The
local price was helped by an impression quite
generally prevailing that crop estimates have
been too liberal. December closed %c higher
at 3OVÂ»Â®3o'ic.
Oats were extremely dull but steady. The I
market lti general followed corn. The entire â¢
range was only J,io. Snow put his estimate
of the crop at 860,000,000 bushels, compared with
his estimate of 799,000,000 last year. Decem
ber closed unchanged.
Provisions barely held their own, showing :
steadiness with hog* which were unchanged I
to 5c up. The cash trade was not brisk. I
January pork closed unchanged; January lard ;

Jacob" Wollner's circular says:. "Although the
London sales now in progress are reported with
a good attendance and extreme prices being
paiU, and although the Eastern markets are
reported strong and active, still our local mar
ket Is comparatively quiet. Generally the local
market goes in advance of the Eastern and Eu
ropean markets. Some wools have been sell-
Ing, but not at extreme prices, and the mar
ket can be quoted quiet, with very little in
quiry from brokers or Eastern ageMs for
either scoured or grease wools at any higher
rates than have prevailed In the last four or
five weeks.
"At the Red Bluff sales last week about 2200
bales were offered and sold at 10@12c, which
was really l@2c per pound more than the mar
ket at present justifies, but as there are about
three million pounds less mountain wool this
year, owing to the fact that sheep were kept
out of the national parks, there is a keen com
petition for all free fall wool.
"There Is still considerable wool in this mar
ket. The country is pretty well bought up,
but very little wool Is coining in on consign
ment.
"Owing to the rise in freight rates to the
East, more wool has been shipped out in the
last three days than for a long time past, both
scoured and In the grease."

METHODISTS IN
FAVOR OF NOT
PAYING TAXES
Violently Oppose the
Seating of Roberts.
- â¦
Oakland Office Pan Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Oct. 6.
The Methodist Church South favors the
exemption of church property from taxa
tion. After a discussion at the conference
to-day on the adoption of the amendment
"to the constitution the following resolu
tion was unanimously adopted:
"Resolved, That we, the members
of the Pacific Conference of the MÂ©th
odist Episcopal Church South indorse
the amendment and cordially commend
It to the favorable consideration of
our people.
"Resolved, That the conference ap
point an advisory committee O. three
v.liich shall co-operate with similar
committees from other denominations
in bringing this measure to the atten-
tion of ihe people."
The special committee appointed by
Uishop Duncan to frame a protest to the
sealing of 'Congressman-elect B. H. Rob
erts of Utah presented the following,
which wits adopted:
"Resolved. That the aggressive atti
tude of the Mormon church with its
3500 Mormon missionaries and her boast
of 7000 additions within the last year
should arouse the peope of this country
and the church of Christ to Increased
vigilance and activity. We advise our
preachers and people everywhere to
be on their guard against these prose
lyting elders.
"Resolved, That the election of B.
11. Roberts of Utah, an avowed polyg
amist, to the House of Representatives
Of the Fifty-sixth Congress is an af
front to civilization. We call upon
every member of the House of Repre
sentatives and of the Senate to use all
honorable means to secure the expul
sion of said Roberts from the House of
Representatives. Also that the Sen
ate and House of Representatives pro
ceed to take proper steps to render by
fit legislation polygamy under any
guise a crime punishable by severe
penalties."
This morning was the time fixed for
tearing reports on the character of mem
bers and the state of work in the various
churches. This part of the programme
Is always very personal and brings out
many interesting and amusing features
of church life.
Bishop Duncan, taking the burning of
the Baptist church in San Francisco as
an example, said that it is not a business-:
Ilk..- policy to Ignore the lnsuranco of
church property. He said there was no
economy ;n saving the price of an Insur-
OJice poncy.
This afternoon the ladies held thoir
conference and discussed home mission
work. To-night Bishop Duncan preached
on missions. To-morrow night the as
signments of ministers for the coming
year will be read by the Bishop.

The Russian colony in this city is highly
elated over the success attending a little
of charity that was done nearly a
year ago. it lias resulted in one of the
unfortunate of their number acquir
ing an Independent fortune and sending
for his family to enjoy it with him on the
Yukon.
ut a year ago B. Ouhwahn was
fighting off starvation for his family of
nine in West Oakland. !!<â¢ was largely
an object of charity and was unable to
procure work. Being a native of Alaska,
Ouhwahn believed that if lie could â â 
tin Yukon h.? could obtain his share of the
gold. li<- could talk the native language
and believed that this knowledge- would
make it possible for him to learn from
the India:. s the location of somp rich ter
ritory that other prospectors could not
find.
His people took the matter under advise
ment, and finally concluded to Bend Ouh
wahn to thi j Yukon and to look after his
children until he should strik<- it rich. He
went north, and last spring he returned
with ( nough gold to remove his family
from th'ir cramped quarters on Third
street to a comfortable resident n Ade
line street. He returned at once to the
Yukon and met with such good luck that
he has Bent down funds for his family to
join him anil to pay back what was ad
vanced him. His family left yesterday
for the north, where Ouhwahn has a pay

CAUGHT IN A
TANGLE OVER
A LAND DEAL
Weller's Suit Against
Barber and Wife.
Oakland Offico San Francisco Call,
MS Broadway, Oct. 6.
The long- delayed deposition of Alvan D.
Brii-k. taken at the National Home for
Disabled Veteran Soldiers at Hampton,
Va., where he is an inmate, was offered
in evidence to-day in the complicated land
case of H. O. Weller against Dr. E. T.
Barber and wife, Matilda Lunt, Barber,
now on trial in Judge Ellsworth's court,
wherein plaintiff seeks to recover two
thlrds of J27.50H, as the proceeds from a
sale of land in Los Angeles County to the
Pacific Improvement Company.
The Brock deposition had been delayed
mainly on account of yellow fever break
ing out at the home several months ago.
Brock is a printer, agod HS years, and ac
cording to his deposition was swindled
out of his land during the boom at San
Pedro ten years ago. and the matter has
been in litigation ever since, Involving
many peopli . besides the Southern Pacilic
Railroad Company and the Pacilic Im
provement Company.
The story of trie present suit is a long
and complicated one. in June, i y< 7. A. W.
Timms sold or bonded t.> Alvan I>. Brock
a certain 704-acre tract in ihc Rancho
Palos Veroes for $;.'." /m". pa\abie in install
ments. A month later Brock bonded to
John \V. Pearson, assigning to the latter
his agreement witli Timms, in considera
tion that Pearson would pay the full
amount of the purchase price and take
title to himself and convey to Brock an
undivided one-fourth interest, free and
clear of inoumbranoes.
Now. according to the complaint. Poar
son took a deed to himself in the name of
his agent, H. V. Burner, and when Brock
demanded a conveyance to himself of his
one-fourth interest Pearson refused.
Brock then bu< d Pearson for a decree that
the latter held the one-fourth interest in
trust. The case went to the Supreme
Court, and eventually, in February, 1891,
Brock got a decree tor one-eighth interest
and requiring Pearson to execute a deed
for that share. In the meantime the Sn u
Pedro Harbor i>ock and Land Association,
the Southern Pacifl< Extension Company,
with full knowledge of the foregoing
factsâso the complaint recitesâ purchased
from Pearson certain interests and were
then made parties defendant. Pearson
still refused to give Brock a deed for his
share, and, being without means to prose
cute the suit. Brock sold his interest
against I', arson to Benjamin F. Atiurton,
who, on February 1850, sold to the pres
ent plaintiff, H. O. Well< r.
Now, prior to the Brock-Pearson case
trial, Weiier entered into an agreement
with E. T. Barber, continues the com
plaint, whereby the latter agreed to un
dertake, and with reasonable speed to ail
just and settle, nil differences between
Brock and Pearson and other defendants;
that he would retain and employ counsel
to press settlement, it was agreed that
the proceeds from the litigation 01
of the property, after all other claims
had been settled, should be divided in
I three parts, plaintiff to receive two part.-,
or two-thirds, and Barber one-third, in
full compensation for his Bervices. Later
Brock also deeded his interest to Barbi r
for the same purpose of carrying out this
same trust agreement between plaintiff
and Barber.
Barber now becoming vested with the
legal title to the tract, In trust, neverthe
less, for plaintiff. Brock, and one L. M.
ton, an Intermediate grantee, the
complaint says he delivered to Stratton
a trust agreement wherein he (Barber)
declared Btratton to be entitled to one
auarter of all moneys or property coming
from the eventual settlement, or from a
decree In the Brock-Pearson suit, and
Btratton deeded to A. E. Davis nil his
interests. Continuing, the complaint re
â¢ That on January 20. 1890, Barber cxc
i a deed to his wife, Matilda I.unt
Barber, conveying all his interests, upon
an alleged consideration of love and af
fection.* * * The deed was recorded
February 18, 1896. * * * Mrs. Barber was
cognizant of all matters and knew of the
or ginal trust deed and knew the deed she
received was in fraud of plaintiff's inter
â  sts and the other beneficiaries. â¢ â¢ * On
March 11, 1597, defendants agreed to sell
to the Pacific Improvement Company the
one-eighth interest for 127,500. They so
sold and received the money, * â¢ * and
subsequently defendants denied and re
pudiated the original trust, denying that
plaintiff was entitled to any right or in
terest in the proceeds of the sale- to the
Pacific Improvement Company."
In conclusion the very lengthy com
plaint recites that Barber willfully disre
garded his obligations under the trust;
that Barber and wife conspired to defraud
plaintiff of his interest and the proceeds
of the sale; that defendants are execution
proof.
In his prayer Weller asks that the court
decree that Barber received the convey
ance In trust; that the deed to Mrs. Bar
ber is without consideration; that defend
ants be required to account for the
proceeds; that they be declared guilty of
fraud: that some disinterested party be
â  inted receiver.
The trial has already occupied three
days, and In all about thirty-seven deeds
have been submitted as exhibits, and more
are promised. The case for ((implications
rivals any that has come within Judgo
Ellsworths scope to hear.
The light thrown on tho complications
by Brock In his deposition is rather hazy.
He appears to know Uttle of Welter's in
terests, and says he repudiated the agree
ment from Athrrton to Weller because lie
deemed It fraudulent. He claims Incident
ally that Pearson duped him and that
Pearson had given out the report that he
i (Brock) had died; that in 1593. while in
San Francisco. E. T. Barber requested
i him to call with him at the Pacific Fm
provemeni Company's office to "show
thÃt the dead had been restored." !l"
wont there and related his circumstanced
a:id relation to the property, and learned
that it appeared Pearson had also swin
dled them ; that I'earson had got off
with $60,000 and secured notes for |150,000,
but that the corporation had corraled
theso notes before Pearson died.
The trial of the suit will be resumed
next Tuesday morning. E. L. Campbell
and J. S. Splllman appear for plaintiff,
and Judge Denson of Attorneys Oatman &
Denson' tor defendants.

ROWDYISM REIGNS AT
DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION
Continued from Seventh Page.
! cratic orgranizatlons of this city. Hence j
the honor at your hands. Gentlemen, I I
have listened to the discussion to-night on >
the resolutions introduced and I believe I
we have evolved a municipal policy in
thifl city which has drawn to its support !
not only every Democrat, but many citi- |
zens who are not tied to any party or
organization. They only want the best j
government and want it conducted hon
estly and in the interest of allâ not Dem
ocrats alone, but in the interests of all !
the people, and our organization is made
the instrument by which the government
may come to the people."
The Mayor then discussed the Chicago
platform and its applicability to munic
pal affairs. He said he could not see any
Inconsistency between the Chicago and
the local platforms, as the former con
tained many provisions which perhaps
would not apply to local affairs, but on 1
th<- other hand it did contain provisions
I which vitally interested the citizens of
this city. He then alluded to the plat
form on trusts and said that the local
eaa and water companies bore a striking â â 
' likeness to the great trusts of the Windy
City. He said he would not care to force
the platform of any city on the voters ;
of this city, but what the party desired
to do was to show them that its principles
are democratic. That the party was op- |
posed to trusts and capital, that it be- i
lit-ved in the power of the rights of the
people and demand of them, no matter!
to what party they belong, to subscribe i
to the I democratic party.
'"iTie candidate of the' Republican party,
in his speech of acceptance last night, as- j
i serted that national issues must be con- j
sidered in this campaign, and appealed I
[ to his convention to get together and arm i
and fortify themselves, for whatâ for the â 
I election next year. Next year? We are 'â â 
not preparing for that election; we are
conducting the election this year. I be- 1
lieve, with all respect to the years of
i public service of Mr. Horace Davis, I say
here that he isâ it is a hard word to use,
but I will use itâ that he is a traitor to
the new government of San Francisco;
that he is false to the charter, when he
uttered that word, when he endeavored
to influence the minds of the people in !
incorporating national issues in a muni-!
cipal campaign, when the spirit of that I
instrument is designed to banish national :
issues from municipal affairs." In con
cluding, the sneaker asked for the support
of all the candidates on the ticket, and
also dwelt on the chances for the im- i
provement of this city. He said that the |
people had cast off its swaddling: clothes
and thought it time to put on a new dress. 1
"Let us have the courage and confident â¢â¢
of a young city, that we are going ahead. I
j Let there be no question of conservatism "
I Thomas Brosnan interrupted the Mayor
i and asked him to give his opinion on the
.street contract Hut the Mayor ignored
the interrupter and quickly finished his i
speech. Again the hall was filled with the
cheers of delegates and spectators and
the Mayor bowed himself into the wings.
! whence he watched the crowning of hU
programme,
Andrew (I. Magulre took the platform
and placed Captain Dennis Geary in
nomination for C -nnty Clerk. He told of
his candidate's service In the Philippines
as a member of the California Regiment
and of his high Btandbig as a citizen. The
name was received with cheers by the
delegates who were in on the programme.
bul many in the lobby and on the floor of
I the convention wanted to know who
Geary was. Charles M. Sioltz followed
and place. l ex-County Clerk M. C.
M. ley In nomination. in a long
speech he called attention to Mr.
Haley's splendid record while in
office and appealed to the delegates to
support him. Thomas J. Ford then fol
â¢ lowed and placed John A. Brown in
I nomination for The office. The nomina
tions having closed, balloting for the can
didates was taken up. As has already
been stated, pandemonium reigned. Af
ter order had been restored another bal

Livingston Jftiks nominated Lewis F.

Bigned by P. H. McCarthy. Ashe had not
proceeded far without cheers, cat calls
and interruptions. The question was put
to the house whether Ashe should eon
! tinue. The "ayes" and the "nr.es" yelled
like madmen. The chair ruled that Ashe
should continue. Ashe then went on. Ho
believed that the convention would Judge
! a candidacy impartially, but he had been
told by William J. BiÃgy that a man rot
on the slat- was a fool to come before the
convention. Groans greeted the state

reform, had told him the same; that he
did not dare to have his name corn*- In -

Gavin McNab.
Here a pandemonium of noises took
place. A young man climbed on the stage
With the seeming Intent to have it out
with Ashe. but he was choked off and
compelled to leave the stage. Ashe then
I took a shy at Charles Wesley Heed, and
said that he had been forced off the ticket
: by McNab.
Sidney Van "Wyck, for about the dozenth
time, interrupted Ashe, and the uproar
was resumed.
When there was another break Ashe.
said that he asked the convention to give
; him a run for his health. He was not
going to seek to get in through the tran
som to the office: If he got in he would
be a fnithful official.
W. W. McNair of the Thirty-ninth nom
inated Colonel Thomas F. Barry. He
j called on Barry to come to the ttage.
Colono] Parry said that his own ser-
I vices had been more eloquent in advocacy
of his candidacy than he could say. if

H. D. LOVELAND CHAIRMAN
â¢
Leading Lines of Business Repre
sented in Central Body, Which
Will Be Increased by Other
Cities.
â¦
The Pacific Coast Traffic Association
<vas called Into existence yesterday after
noon at the meeting of wholesalers, job
bers and manufacturers. An executive
committee was elected and the organiza
tion was further forwarded by the elec
tion of 11. D. Loveland as chairman and
"W. R. Wheeler as vice chairman by the
executive committee. The immediate pur
pope of the association is to oppose the
suit of the St. Louis jobbers before the In
terstate Commerce Commission to put into
offect ffraded rates and to make, other rul
ings which would seriously affect the busi
ness of the whole Pacific Coast.
The meeting was called to order by H.
1 1. Loveland, who nominated Charles llol
brook for chairman. The choice being rat-
Hied, Mr. Holbrook addressed those pres
ent at some length. Nearly every large
business house In the city was repre
sented.
H. D. Loveland said that the business
men of the coast must defeat the Eastern
men or be defeated in business. The
Eastern Jobbers sought to wipe out the
differential between the carload an I less
than carload; to grade rates from the At
lantic board to St. Louis; to do away
with Pacific Coast terminals. Graded
rates would mean that every point wtst
of New York to St. Louis should have
lower rates than New York on Pacific
Coast business. If it was proper to grade
to Pt. Louis it was proper also to grade
to Reno, Cruel and Benicia, and these
points would have lower rates than San
Francisco. The Interstate Commerce Com
mission was the court of last resort.
Grading rates would put the Atlantic
Coast at a disadvantage, for which reason
the Atlantic seaboard should make com
mon cause with the Pacific Coast This
was understood in the East, and com
munications had already been received
from Eastern commercial organizations.
Grading would limit the market in which
San Francisco could buy or sell. Mr.
Loveland also showed the disastrous ef
fect that abolishing Pacific Coast ter
minals would have.
W. R. Wheeler reported a plan of or
ganization which was adopted. This fixed
the name, provided for an executive com
mittee of nine to represent the principal
lines of business on the coast, five mem
bers to be a working body; Los Angeles,
Sacramento, Portland and Puget Sound
cities to appoint additional members; pro
viding also for committees from principal
lir.es to collect funds for expenses also
that the executive committee should ap
point officers. This was adopted.
Remarks were made by A. A. Watkins,
H. D. LOYELAND, Chairman.
Officers of the Pacific Coast Traffic Association Elected Yesterday.

Reconstruction of Post Street From
Cable to Trolley to Eegin
Next Week.
The Market-street Railway Company is
fast pushing its corkscrew trolley line
Into practical Bhape. Ground was broken
yesterday on Sansome Btrc-et, north of
Jackson, over which the trolley line will
extend to the northern tenuous of that
thoroughfare.
Taylor street, from Market to Post, is
finished, as is Sixth street, from Market
to Kraniian, except at a few of the stret-t
crossings, which will be completed within
the next few (Jays. The cars on Post and

Governor Rogers and several members
of his staff, besides a number of ladies,
visited the general hospital yesterday In
search of any Washington men that
| might be there, so they might decorate
the sufferers with the State medal to be
presented to the men of the regiment
1 when it has returned.
There were seven Washington men In
the hospitalâ Nelson Churchill, John J
McNeill, Louis E. Brlttson and C.
H. Hovey of Company H, Robert
E. Bucklin of Company K and
Jesse Arnold and Robert T. Golden of
Company C. Golden was so ill with ty
phoid that no one but the Governor was
allowed to see him, but the others were
ail ready and anxious to see the delega
, tion, and in each ward where there was a
Washington man quite a levee was held.
Governor Rogers himself decorated each
! man, at the same time acknowledging
his service in the name of the State.
The medals are of bronze, In the form of
' a Maltese cross, in the center of which is
j a design of a soldier holding a flag, with
a fortified sea coast in the distance and
cannons and rifles in the foreground, On
the arms of the cross are the name of the
regiment and the dale of the war. The
medal is swung by a tricolored ribbon
from a bar formed by a spread eagle and
two flags bearing the words, â â¢in recog
, nition of service in the Philippines." The
decoration is an exceedingly neat one.
The Governor and his party were taken
through the Hospital by Acting Assistant
Surgeon Bonar, who was officer of the I
: day.
Word has been received that Colonel I
Kessler, commanding the Montana Regi- \
mem, has been made a brigadier general. j
This will allow the promotion of Lieu* i
tenant Colonel B. 11. Cook, Major John i
R. Miller and Captain George W. Roil'.

ranks will be made fore the regiment ;

not come back to this side of the bay,
but will leave its present camp to go on

Letters from the East written to an in

During the past ten days prominent

Dear Sir: A call will soon be issued for a j

What Happened to Jones When He

rough, Indeed. But when the wooing is
a sort of Miles Standish affair and pome
cmi' else is to profit by your devotion then
the unpleasantness becomes akin to pain, j
None know this better than Clarence
H. Jones, an enterprising theatrical man
from Portland, Or., who has only been in
the city a short time. According to the
story of .Mr. Jones, told at the Palace
Hotel, he and another gentleman under
took yesterday afternoon to convey the
solace of affection to two imprisoned of
ficers of the Thirty-first Regiment, at
present quarantined at Angel Island.
This solace was represented by two love
ly young ladies, the sweethearts of the
quarantined officers.
Everything had been so nicely arranged
by letter that there seemed to be no pos
sibility Of a Slip. Jones and the precious
freight he was conveying were to go from
this city to Tiburon, where tht y were to
get a boat and row over to the
island. The officers had subsidized an im
pecunious private in keep watch and no
tify them of the arrival of the boat,
which they were to meet at a certain
place.
Jones and his friend carried out their
part of the campaign to the letter and
all went well until the watching private
gave tlie Mpnal of the boat's approach.
This signal not only aroused the ex
pectant 'iftieers, hut alarmed the guard.
who arrived on the scene just in time to
see the boat within the quarantine line
and the two officers waiting on tne shore
to meet it.
The officers were at once ordered to
their quarters under arrest and the oc
cupants of the boat were directed to land
and bo chained up also.
This they were more than willing to do,
as the plug: in the bottom of the boat had
come out and the ladies were sitting in
water up to their knees with a fair pros
pect of the boat Binking.
Before they had proceeded many yards
landward Jones found the plug and," put
tin? it in the hole, directed his companion
to pull for the Tiburon shore while he
bailed out.
As soon as the soldiers on the beach no
ticed the boat change direction they called
upon its occupants to retrace their course
or be shot. The ladies pleaded for Jones
to keep on and get them out of the
scrape, which hr â gallant fellow that he
isâ did. nor was his speed toward the
Tiburon shore lessened by three bullets
which the minions of Uncle Sam sent
whistling over the boat.
However, the bullets went wide of their
mark, and the whole party escaped to
Belvedere and thence to the city.
Jones, in summing up the engagement
last night, reported the following losses
in his command: Two ruined pair of
trousers, two pair damp silk stockings, a
number of skirts stained by sea water.

hands, one female lying In apartments of

NEW SENSATION IN THE
HITE DIVORCE CASE
WITNESS WRIGHT APPEARS IN
AN UNENVIABLE ROLE.
"Indian Lucy's" Neighbors Testify-
That They Knew Her Only
as "Hite's Wife."
The story of the early life of Lucy Hite,
the Indian woman who is trying to estab
lish the claim that she is the wife of
John It. i lite, the Marlposa miner, was
retold yesti rday hefore Judge J. P. Jones
of Mariposa County, who has moved his
(mum to this city for the accommodation
of some of the witnesses. During the
day's proceedings James Wright, who
claims to be a collector In the employ of
the estate <>f Mark Strouse, surprised the
attorneys for the plaintiff by refusing to
repeal on the witness stand statements
he had made to them during the early
of the case. He was charged with
having -sold himself to both sides of the
cause. Attorney Foote, for the defend
ant, grilled him, insinuating that he w ;s
an opium liend and several other things
that were not complimentary.
Wright was the bellboy at the Hotel j
El < lapitan, Mariposa, from 1873 to 1880. |
When the Hite case first attracted his 'â 
attention he went to Attorney Van K.
Paterson, who wus representing the
dusky plaintiff, and told In detail how
Hite and the woman had gone to the ho
tel during his connection with tne hos
telry and that Hite had registered her
as his wife. The incident had left a vivid
Impression on his mind from the act that
it was such an unusual thing for a white
man to be married to an Indian. '1 he
hotel has been closed for many years,
but Wrignt told Mr. l'aterson where the
dust-covered registers could be found in
one of the rooms and indicated in which I
book the entry of "John R. Hite and !
wife" could be found. The attorneys
found Wright's story to be substantially
correct and expected when he was called
yesterday that he would repeat his for
mer story. But he did not. He stated in
reply to the attorneys' direct questions
that the register story waa based only on
his impressions; that he had no scruples
about telling the original yarn to Mr.
Paterson for ttu- reason thai he was not
then on the witness stand and was not
making a statement under oath.
Attorney Hanldn forced an admission
from \V light that he had discussed the!
case with Sherman Reynolds, wfco is ac
cused of having erased the names from
the register and who admits having re
ceived money from both sides of the case.
Indian Lucy, as the plaintiff in the case
is known in Mariposa, was the star at
traction in the morning. She had a happy
faculty of misunderstanding nearly every
question put to her by Attorney Foote,
but was remarkably ready with her an
swers to her own attorney, Mr. Ilanlon.
She said that Mr. Foote's manner made
her wild and the attorney could not re-
Bist asking her if at that particular
time she was wild or tame and that if
It was not a fact that she understood
Mr. Hanlon so readily because he was a
"big medicine man."
Lucy is not a beauty. She has a com
plexion like a rusty horseshoe and there
is not a characteristic feature about her
to lead one to believe that in her younger
day* she was a belle of the Mariposa
country. She described how she and Hite
had been married according to the In
dian customs by Hite taking her on his
knee and saying in her native tongue "I
marry you." She denied that she had
ever been In love with Sam Westphal or
had call<vl him "her boy" or had told
Perry Holland that Sam was "the father
of her child." She also denied that she
had been the wife of "Yankee Jim." an
other prominent man of Mariposa in tne
days when Lucy was a belle. She was
equally emphatic in branding as a "false
hood" that she had lived with Mr. Gibbs
as his wife. Numerous affidavits were
read from those who knew the plaintiff
only as "Hite's wife." and their tenor
indicated that the ways of the Âiariposa
women in discussing the affairs of their
neighbors are not diff"rent from those
of other sections of the country.
One woman, who claimed that Hite had
robbed her of a mine, thought he was a
real funny man because he went to San
Francisco and bought silk dresses for
Lucy "to deck her out like a lady."
The trial will be continued next Tues
dey morning and the attorneys txpect to
finish the testimony by Wednesday,
