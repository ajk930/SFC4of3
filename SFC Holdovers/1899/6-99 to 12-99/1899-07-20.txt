Out Under Fire.
Special PiFpatch to The Call.
The withdrawal of General Rus
sell A. Alger from the Cabinet is
merely a realization of what think
ing: men have seen to be inevitable
ever since the exploitations of the
scandals attending the character of
th_ supplies furnished to the Ameri
can troops in the Spanish war.
It was made clear enough at the
several investigations that the troops
had suffered more from the character
of the food given them than from the
bullets of the enemy. The blame for
this was not traced directly to Alger,
but as the head of the War Depart
ment Alger was responsible. He has
paid the penalty in part for his re
sponsibility.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WEL
LINGTON HOTEL, WASHING
TON, July IS.â Algerism is at last
at an end. Official ostracism, per-
sistent and pointed, aided by the
sage advice of Vice President Hobart,
has finally brought about the result so
urgently demanded by the country the
resignation of .Russell A. Alger as Sec
retary â  â¢>' War.
The resignation was not voluntary.
Had it not been tendered it would have
been requested.
The. climax in the career of General
Atger as head of the- War Department
came at the White House soon after
noon to-day. when the President de
clined to carry any longer the heavy
load of the Secretary's Inefficiency, al
though the latter suggested means by
which he could be induced to remain
in the Cabinet. This suggestion was
that the President should publicly an
nounce his satisfaction with General
Alger's conduct of his department.
Plainly appreciating the feeling of the
country, and believing that the public
interests demanded that there should be
at the head of the War Department a
man of vigor and judgment, capable of
handling the Philippine situation, the
President, it is said, was compelled to
show General Alger that he could not
do as he desired.
Thereupon General Alger informed
the President that his resignation was
at his disposal and produced a formal
letter of resignatio-n, which he had pre
pared in anticipation of the President's
declination to comply with his wishes.
the resignation to take effect at the
pleasure of the President.
This dramatic scene will probably be
never accurately described. Secretary
Alger declined to speak of what
passed between him and the President,
and referred all inquirers to the White
Hon . for an explanation. At the
White House requests for information
were met with the statement that
General Alger might have something
to say. It can be said authoritatively,
however, thai the President made it
clear to-day that the chief cause of his
desire for a severance of the official
relations existing between them was
the alliance General Alger had formed
with Governor Pingree.
The formal .change of letters
which will close Secretary Alger's con
nection with the War Department will
be concluded with the President's ac
cepts of ':â â â  Secretary's resigna
tion. It is unlikely that this will give
any indication as to the exact reason
for action on either side.
In his last hours of political trouble
Secretary Alger turned to his great
and good friend. Vice President Ho
bart. Upon pretext of going to New-
York to witness the yacht race. Secre
tary Alger visited Vice President Ho
bart and informed him of the trouble
in the President's official family. Pie
urged Vice President I : bart to use his
good offices with the President to the
end that he might remain in the Cabi
net long enough to prepare his annual
report.
Secretary Alger, it is stated, drew
up a provisional resignation on the
lines Indicated and placed it in the
hands of the Vice President. Either the
text or the ibstance of this provi
sional resignation was conveyed to the
President, but it was not acceptable.
When Secretary Alger returned to
the department to-day, after his talk
with the President, he looked like a
man from whose mind a weight had
been lifted. However, although he
must have felt the ignominy of being
practically dismiss,-,! from the Cabinet,
he did not show it to department offi
cials i or to his callers. Yet to his per
sonal friends he expressed himself with
bitterness concerning the treatment he
had received. Outside of the matter of
personal pride, there is no question, that
he is glad he has resigned, and that
he can now retire to private life to ob
tain the rest he needs.
It was stated late to-night that the j
President had not fully determined |
upon a successor to Secretary Alger, i
but that the names' receiving most j
serious consideration at the present]

time are those of Embassador Porter *
and General James H. Wilson of Dela- j
ware. Affairs at the War Department
will in the meantime be administered i
by Assist Secretary Meiklejohn,
who is now- in the West. He has been
summoned by wire.
Harmony in the War Department is
the groat desire of the President now.
I understand that a conference between
the President and Major General Miles
on Monday, the desirability of more
pleasant relations between the major
general commanding and the head of
the War Department was alluded to,
and other War Department officials
have been given to understand that
they will be expected, to show- to Gen
eral Miles in future the? respect the man
and the office demand.
It is thought not improbable that the
Presider.t may take Governor Roose
velt's advice and appoint General Wood
to take charge of the War Department.
It is known that the President thinks
highly of General Wood's ability v:; a
military and executive officer. He Is
personally acquainted' with him. and is
very fond of him.
1 was told to-night that General
Wood is a very strong probability in
case the President abandons the idea
he has had in mind for some time of se
curin ; the best legal mind he can ob
tain *"or the important office. The. fact
that General Wood declined a tempting
business offer to resume his command
in Santiago is thought by many to indi
cate that he elected to remain in the
army in anticipatio: of a brilliant fu
ture in official life.
Mr. Alger's future career in politics
is difficult to forecast. Being relieved
from Cabinet duty, he is now free to
continue his race for the Senate. Those
who enjoy his confidence say he is dis
gusted with the inconsistencies of po
litical life and that he will hold his
Senatorial ambitions in check until he
learns how his friends in Michigan feel
in regard to the treatment he has re
ceived from the President.
The transfer of Attorney General
Griggs from the Department of Justice
to the War Department has been sug
gested by th>se who are figuring on
Alger's successor to-night. It is urged
that the largely increased legal ques
tions which are constantly- coming be
fore th- War Department as a conse
quence of our new possessions makes it
desirable that the executive officer
should be a man of legal attainments
and experience. In this connection the
name of ElihU Root, the well-known
New York lawyer, is mentioned.

(\S A MARTYR
Will Not Decide or) the Sena
torial Race Until Y\e Re
turns to Detroit.
DETROIT, July 19.â General Alger
will not decide whether he will run for
the United States Senate until he re
turns to Detroit in about two weeks.
Friends close to him say that he is dis
gust-d with the hollowness of political
honors, the ingratitude and treachery of
political associates, and deeply feels the
cruel injustice of the assaults made up
on him in connection with the conduct
of the- War Department. They say the
President, in abandoning him, has act
ed in a manner that has been anything
but straightforward and frank.
Alger is disposed to retire from poli
tics altogether and devote himself en
tirely to his great business interests,
but a decision has not been made. It is
felt here that his alliance with Gover
nor Pingree had much influence with
the President. Governor Pingree re
fused to believe that the Secretary had
resigned when made acquainted with
the report from Washington.
"I don't believe it at all," he exclaim
ed. "I won't believe it until I know
more than just your newspaper reports.
The President has stood by Mr. Alger
and I think he should. If Alger hand
ed in his resignation it will not be ac
cepted anyway."
"Did Mr. Alger's senatorial aspira
tions have anything to do with it?" the
Governor was asked.
"No siree. I'd like to knoic Vwhy.

"Was it necessary for him to resign

here?" he as asked.
"I don't know about it." he replied
slowly. "All these newspapers, when
in combination, can ruin anybody."

WORDS FOR ALGER

His Conduct of the War
Department. â  â  '--"
NEW YORK. July 20.â The Herald says;
"That Secretary Alger's resignation â  will
be accepted goes without saying. In the
appointment of a successor a solemn duty
devolves upon Mr. McKinley.
"The vital need of the hour is a war
minister who is a soldier and a patriot,
who will rescue the War Depart
from the decadence into which it has
sunk under Secretary Alger.
"We trust there Is nothing in the re
port that the President intends to ap
point some great New York lawyer to
this high office, which at this juncture is
of supreme importance. It Is not an At
torney General that Is to be chosen, bin
a Secretary of War. Mr. McKinlev Ir
his first appointment made a calamitous
and awful mistake: he cannot afford to
make another now."
The World says: "Secretary Alger has
again 'retired under fire.' Public opinion,
which has been powerless in inducing th-
President to ask for his resignation, has
proved strong enough to force him to re
sign.
'If Mr. McKinley had asked the Secre- j
tary of War to retire a year ago, when
the demonstration of his utter unfitness j
was complete, he would have saved his
administration from the odium of Ale,
Ism. But by retaining and sustaining him
until he voluntarily retires the President j
has made himself responsible for Alger's
offenses and shortcomings. It is too late j
for a scapegoat. Alger resigning under j
'outside pressure' becomes more a victim
.than a burden bearer."
The Press says: "History will undoubt
edly reverse the Secretary's judgment of
his career. Bui its final verdict will be j
that the army was got into as good work
ing order in his time as its antiquated j
and inflexible machinery permitted. This !
is not high praise, but. owing to our fixed
custom of letting all the staff enginery go i
to rust between wars, it is the highest
that can be bestowed on any man' whom
the outbreak of any hostilities has found
in office. And the Secretary can at least
congratulate himself that the army i
rather the peopleâ has under him learned
Its ever-forgotten and ever-recurrent les
son without corruption and without disas
ter."
The Journal says: "Alger is down.
When the wind blows through the orchard
it is the rottenest fruit that falls first.
"Alger now Otis next. Then, perhaps,
Corbin, and then, pattering down too j
swiftly to count, the whole worthless lot
of War Department incompetents and ma
lignants thai have brought the nation to!
shame and smeared discredit on the in- ,
comparable valor of American troops.
"The Journal heartily congratulates the
administration and the American people
on this auspicious beginning of reform.
There would probably have been beef
scandals if Alger had never been inside
the War Department; Shaffer and Otis
would have made their records under any
Secretary and the anti-Scl.ley intrigue was
; worked up in a department that Alger
, never touched."
The Times says: "It will be agreed
about Secretary Alger as it was said about
Cawdor in 'Macbeth,' that 'Nothing In his
life became him like leaving it.'
' CHICAGO, July 19.â The Inter Ocean,
which has upheld Secretary Alger
through the entire controversy, will
say: "The forces arrayed against
Secretary Alger â military, personal
and political â have prevailed, and he
has sent his situation to the President.
Had General Alger resigned six mouths
ago it would have been said the friends of
General Miles had driven him from the
Cabinet. Had he resigned three months
ago it wodld have been said the President
had yielded to the outcry against the War
Department raised by the Mugwump and
Democratic press. Neither of these things
can be said now.
The Record says: "President McKinley's
desire to receive a second term of office at
the hands of the American people long
ago rendered inevitable Alger's departure
from the Cabinet. That departure was
only a question of time and manner. Al
ger at last has chosen to resign, and It Is

Special Dispatch to The Call.
Senator Piatt of New York has
appeared in print as the defender of
the course of the administration in
the conduct of the war in the Philip
pines. The defense is ably presented
by an able advocate. The great fact,
which Mr. Piatt dots not attempt to
controvert, perhaps because he can
not, remains: The struggle of the
Filipinos is for liberty.
NEW FORK, July*l9. Senator Piatt
gave out a carefully prepared
statement to-night at the Fifth
Avenue Hotel on the war in the Philip
pines, in which he says ;
I purpose herein to answer certain
criticisms which are being directed at the
conduct of '.'.â¢ war In the Philippines. I
do not refer to the criticisms of those
who. In the name of liberty and philan
thropy, are advocating a policy of na
tional cowardice and dishonor. Their
ugliness obtrudes from everything they
say.* To make an end of the rebellion, to
bring out a condition of order and peace
in the Philippines, is not their object. On
the contrary, nothing is clearer than the
fact that they want their country's arms

The suicide of Florence Parker, concerning which Coroner Hill sought to

HE TRIED TO JOIN FLORENCE
PARKER IN THE GRAVE
Aged George Bailey Twice Attempted to End
His Sorrow at Her Suicide by
Taking His Own Life.
The Tragedy That Followed That Night of Wild
Revelry at the French Ball Culminated in a
Decidedly Sensational Aftermath,
GEORGE I. BAILEY, one of the
proprietors of the Golden Gate
Stables, 25 Golden Gate ave
nue, tried twice Saturday to
kill himself. The moving
cause each time was the* knowledge
that Florence Parker had committed
suicide early that morning by reason of
his refusal to take her back to his
protection.
For reasons best known to them
selves, the mother of the dead girl and
State Senator Bettman, whose relation
ship to the family is close, although
nowhere recorded in black and white,
tried to make it appear that Florence
Parker died from natural causes.
They appear not to have had the
slightest trouble in inducing Dr. Hill,
who holds the record for being the
greatest make-believe that ever sat in
the Coroner's chair, to believe the same
way. They were not so successful witl*.
Bailey. He believed the report that
Dr. Levison, the family physician,
made to Coroner's Deputy Gately. that
the girl had taken carbolic -acid. A few-
hours before she died she told him it
was her intention to commit suicide,
and when he was summoned to her
side he knew she had kept her word.
Bailey saw the girl twice between
dark on Friday night and the time he
heard of her death Saturday morning.
The first time was at 11 o'clock at
night. She called at his rooms, 110
Jones street, to labor with him to take
her back to that place in his affections
she had lost when she deserted him for
another. He was obdurate. She plead
ed the thoroughness of the horse
whipping she had given him a few days
before as indubitable evidence of the
love she bore him. He said he believed
her, but it was too late; their lives
had separated and he would not be the
one to unite them again. The' girl
cried and took on at an alarming rate,
but the man was firm and laughed at
the threat she threw out at parting
that she would kill herself.
Bailey retired after the girl had
gone and was soundly sleeping when
the girl, her mother, Mrs. Ella Parker,
and Lillie Nelson plunged into the
seething revelry at the French ball.
All the cares of his sixty odd years had
tied from the pillow ereâ the mother
and chum applaudingâ the reckless girl
stood on a table and kicked for their
edification a trayful of liquor into the
nearest crowd of Bacchanalian admir
ers. Bailey did not dream that the im
pulsive girl, whose morals had been
improved neither by association at
home nor in the flat in which he had es
tablished her, was making one mad
night of it before the plunge into eter
nity. He had no reason to believe be

him from his slumbers. His surprise

can be imagined when his sleep was
disturb, about 5:30 o'clock in the
morning by- Florence Parker's summons
at the door.
Bailey ".rose hastily and admitted
her. She pleaded once more to be tak
en back, but he refused. She told him
then, starting to leave, that she intend
ed to commit suicide. Something in
the manner of the girl alarmed her for
mer protector and he commence plead
ing with her to do nothing so rash. She
was firm, however, and Bailey believed
that she would make away with her
self f she was not watched.
"Wait a minute till I dress myself,"
lie said, leaving her to go into his bed
room, "and I'll go with you and talk
the whole thing â er."
He never saw* her alive again. While
he was dressing she left noiselessly and
he found her place vacant when he
went into the room a few minutes later.
alley returned to bed to sleep a
troubled sleep, which was broken the
second time by the arrival of a messen
ger from Mrs. Parker, who said the liv
eryman was wanted immediately at the
house â that F-~rence was very sick. It
took Bailey the shortest possible time
to reach 1410 Devisadero street, fully*
prepared as he was to hear that the girl
had tried to kill herself. He was not
prepared, however, for the announce
ment that met him at the door that she
was dead. The man was completely
overcome and had to be supported into
the room where she lay. He broke
completely down at sight of her body
and wept bitter tears.
As soon as he could pull himself to
gether Bailey made his way to his
rooms, where, as after events proved,
he set about the work of self-destruc
tion. Carefully locking the doors and
stuffing the cracks, he prepared for
death. First of all he wrote a note in
which he admitted that he had killed
himself for love of Florence Parker
and asking that he be buried at her
side. Then he turned on the gas, and
he having placed the note on a table
where it could be seen by the first
comer, he doffed his coat and vest, took
from its place on the mantel a photo
graph of the dead girl and, stretching
himself at full length on the bed, the
' photograph resting on his breast, he
turned on the gas and prepared to die".
Bailey's condition was discovered
just in time to save his life. It was
his custom to appear at the stables
each morning between 8:30 and 9
o'clock. Ten o'clock Saturday morn
; ing having arrived and there being no
sign of him, the attaches came to the
conclusion that he was oversleeping.
It was decided to call him, and one of
the stablemen went over to his rooms
at 110 Jones street for that purpose.
The man knocked on the door several
times, and getting no response, was on
the point' of leaving in the belief that
his employer was not in the rooms,
when he detected a strong odor of es
caping gas. A brief investigation con
vinced him that the .poison was com
ing from Bailey's loom. He hurried
back to the stable and informed the
others of what he had discovered, add
ing that if Bailey was in the room he
must be dead.
This information caused an alarm in
the stable, and three or four of thÂ«
men hurried over to the room in the
hope that they would arrive before it
was too late. They broke in the door
and found their employer at full length
on the bed, purple in the face, gasping
for breath in the last stages of as
phyxiation. On his heaving breast
was the photo of Florence Parker, and
on the table was the note he had
penned before he turned on the gas.
Dr. McNeil was sent for at once,
and upon his arrival went to work
to resuccitate the dying liveryman.
The fact that he was dying had
soon spread among his friends, and
during the morning there was a
large number of callers at his
rooms, among those summoned being
Liilie Nelson, who had accompanied
Florence Parker to the French ball.
She was sitting at the bedside when
the work of the physician began to
have its effect and Bailey opened his
eyes. The man was suffering intensely
and begged to be allowed to die.
Florence was dead, he said, and
he had nothing more to live for.
"I might have married Florence," he
sobbed, "and this would not have hap
pened. I loved the girl, but I could not
stomach the idea of that fellow, Sig
Bettman. for a father-in-law."
His friends talked with him while the
doctor worked away, and shortly after
12 o'clock the liveryman was pro
nounced out of danger. He had calme,>
down considerably, and, although tear
ful., announced that he would not again
attempt his life. He insisted on hold
ing the hand of Miss Nelson and of
talking to her about the dead girl.
Notwithstanding Bailey's protestations
that he would not seek solace for his
sorrow in suicide, it was determined by
his friends that his condition was such
that he might try it at any time. It
was decided, therefore, to place a2
AWFUL ATTEMPT
OF A YOLO FARMER
AT WIFE-MURDER
Scope of Ugly Wounds Inflicted
With a Butcher
Knife a
WOODLAND, July 10.â The farm of
Fred Lederer. near this city, was the
scene of a horrible butchery this morn
ing. The old farmer attacked his wife
with a butcher knife and Inflicted a score
of ugly wounds, from which it Is not like
ly that she will recover; lie then chased
his Utile daughter about the place, in
tending to take her life also, but she
eluded him and escaped to the home of a
neighbor. The general impression is that
Lederer Is not in his right mind, but he
has been a quarrelsome fellow, and his
crime has aroused th, entire community,
even to the -tent that there is talking
of summarily avenging the poor woman.
On July 10 Fred Lederer Si. had his son
Fred rested on a charge of stealing 150
sacks of grain. The old man was sus
pected of being mentally unbalanced, and
when the young man came to Woodland
on July 12 his explanation was of such a
satisfactory character that the case
against him was dismissed. young Le
derer, after consultation with friends, de
cided to swear out a complaint, charging
his father with Insanity. Several days
later Deputy Sheriff Griffin visited the
Lederer farm, but failed to find the old
man. Upon the promise of the young
man to bring his father to Woodland as
soon as he could nnd him, the Deputy
Sheriff abandon* I all effort to serve the
warrant.
On the Lederer farm there are two
houses nearly a mill apart. One of these
has been occupied by the elder Lederer.
The other is occupied by Mrs. Lederer,
hi two sonsâ Fred a;ijl Charlesâ and her I
15-year-old daughter Richie. The farm is j
near Flainfield In hat is known as the
Kgypt district, nine miles southwest of
Woodland.
Last night Mrs. Lederer, her son Fred
and daughter Richie wen at home, j
Charles was with a threshing crow work- j
ing ear Cachevllle. Early this morn
ing Fred Lederer left the farm for Davis
vllle with a load of grain. It was nearly
h o'clock when the elder Lederer appeared
at the house. Nobody but the little girl
can tell what occurred thereafter, and the
awful scene she witnessed has so c m
pletely unnerved her that her story is
unconnected and in many respects lack
ing in detail.
After an angry conversation Lederer
seized a butcher knife and made a move
ment as if to stall ids wife. She ran out
of the house, closely pursued by the
angry man. The little girl followed. The
chase continued about 300 yards. The
poor woman was exhausted and could go
no further. When Leden came up a
struggle for the knife ensued, during
which the woman's hands were hacked
nnd the lingers nearly severed. Shi re
ceived three ct.is on the head, one sever
ing: the temporal artery. One leg was
slaphed in three places. Twelve or fifteen
frightful wounds war- inflicted about the
hips.
Lederer left his wife for dead and
chased the little girl back to the house,
with the evident intention of killing her
also. At the house he chased her around
the wheat pile, In the yard. Thinking
to frighten him away, the girl exclaimed:
"There comes the Sheriff." Ledi ret fled.
watch upon him until the effects of th. |
gas had been thoroughly dissipated. i
For this purpose one of the stablemen I
was instructed to leave Bailey's room
under no circumstances whatever un
til he was relieved by some ether
watcher.
About 5 o'clock in the afternoon, the -
watcher was alone in the room with his
employer. They were chatting away,
when Bailey said hi was beginning to j
feel all right again. "I'm getting hun- |
gry," he said, "and that's a good sign. J
1 wish 1 had some oysters. I guess j
you had better, go and get me some." j
The watcher, not suspecting that this I
was merely a ruse to get him out of the â â 
way. took the money his employer prof- !
fered and started for the oysters. In j
going to the place to which he had been j
directed, the watcher had to pass the:
stable, where he was seen by another of |
the employes, who asked him why he j
had left Bailey. The messenger replied
that he was getting oysters for the liv- !
eryman. The other, hot believing that ;
it was safe for a moment to leave
Bailey alone, hastened to.his room and
found his suspicions confirmed, lie
knocked on the door and. found it lock
ed.- .He tried to force "; the door and
could 'not,: so he ran for help- and. the
door was forced a second time, Bailey
again being found stretched on the bed :
almost asphyxiated.
Two physicians were sent for this
time, and they had their hands full in
bringing the indent liveryman to j
his senses. They did so after the most j
painful efforts, and once more Bailey j
was conscious of the different kinds of
fool he had made of himself. He was
sorry that his efforts had not met with
success, but said that as he had made j
such a failure of the Job he would not
try it again. Again, during the even
ing he had a great many callers, who, ;
while they, sympathized with his sor
row at the death of Miss Parker, could
not refrain from joking with him in j
the hope of cheering him up. Ex-Super
visor Delany, who is still lame as the i
result of a recent stroke of paralysis,
was one of the foremost. tf- ... ."-â¢"â 
'Bailey," be said, "you ought to he |
ashamed of yourself for trying to get
off the earth while I'm spending my
money trying to stay on."
Bailey admitted this and put in the
rest of the evening recuperating, a reg- |
ular, procession of champagne bottles l
entering the room to add to the festivi- j
ties incident on his two narrow escapes j
from death. He never could have j
known in any other way how well he j
was thought of, and this knowledge,
probably more than anything else, re
solved him to make no more attempts
on his life. He was at his stables yes
terday, looking only a little the worse
for the wear and tear of his two expe
riences with carbon-monoxide.
Although Bailey was told by the girl j
that she intended . to commit suicide;
despite the fact that she told several !
others at the French ball that she was
taking one last pull at pleasure's cup
before drinking the dregs of death;
notwithstanding- that Dr. Levison re
ported that the girl had killed herself,
and in the face of the fact that Coroner
Hill did not order the holding of. such
an autopsy as is usual In cases where
poison is suspected, that official pro
fessed to believe as late as last night
that Florence Parker had died from
natural causes.
What influenced him in this belief is
not known -certainly hot an analysis
of the contents of the girl's stomach,
such as should have been made by a
coroner desirous of doing his duty.
Maybe it was the honey in the words
of that fifth wheel in the Parker
wagon, State Senator Sig. .Bettman.
No matter what it was, Coroner Hill
seems to have taken pains not only to
believe the "natural causes" theory
himself, but to have used every effort
to deceive the public into the belief
that Florence Parker was not a sui
side. He had the autopsy at 9 o'clock
at night at the home of the dead girl.
He barred out the reporters on the
ground that they were not relatives' of
the deceased, but he admitted Sig.
Bettman. to the room where the au
topsy was being performed on the
ground that he was. The Coroner was
satisfied on this point without docu
mentary evidence. The Coroner did
! taking the knife with him. The little girl
i then ran over to the residence of Thomas
Brothers: She was so frightened she
, could scarcely talk coherently enough to
make her story understood. She imally
made Mrs. Brothers understand that her
father had attempted to murder her
mother. ?"â 'â  â  _ ,
Mrs. Brothers hurriedly drove to Fred
Sieferman's place and notified Sleferman
of the occurrence. Sieferman hastened to
the Lederer house. When he arrived there
he found Roy Saliag and a hired man al
ready there. The three men found Mrs.
1.. lerer where the old man had left her.
She was weak from loss of blood, but
still able to speak faintly. They carried
i her back home and Al Hawkins, another
. neighbor, drove to Woodland for a physi
cian. Dr. Volsard responded to the call.
The woman was still conscious, but too
weak to give an account of the tragic
affair. . .:'â â 
More than sixty stitches were required
to close the wounds. Dr. V'olsard says in
all his experience he never witnessed such
a sickening spectacle. Th- butchery' of
the woman was so horrible as to be al
most indescribable. â¢
If Mrs Lederer dies an effort will be
made th clear !., derer on the ground of
insanity, but many citizens who know him
! intimately are willing to go on th, stand
! and testify he is perfectly sane, but a
I devil incarnate. On the other hand an
old resident of Yolo County who Knows
something of Lederer's life in Germany,
contributes a bit of information of in
terest just now. Lederer and family came
to the United States eight or ten years
ago. Lederer had been in an asylum in
Germany and had two sons In the army.
The Government offered to give the sons
their discbarge and pay passage for them
selves and (heir father if they would
leave the country. The offer was ac
cepted.
Man;.- rumors are In circulation to the
effect that Lederer's neighbors are In
furiated over his crime and that in the
event of the death of the wife an effort
may he made to lynch him.
At a late hour this afternoon District
Attorney Hush, a shorthand reporter and
Dr. Voisard wont out to the Lederer farm.
They found that Mrs. Lederer had per
ceptibly rallied from the first shock. If
no peritonitis sets in she may recover,
but the chances are considered very slim.
The deposition of the little girl was taken.
No new evidence was gleaned except that
l. derer had repeatedly threatened mem
bers of he family.
Shortly before noon Charles Brown In
formed Deputy Sheriff Brown and Mar
shal Lawson that at 9 o'clock he saw
Lederer on Cemetery avenue. The officers
decided to make a search of the city for
him.
While Under Sheriff Brown was locking
up the office Marshal Lawson walked on
ahead in the direction of court, lie met
Lederer face to face at the southwest
gateway to the Courthouse square. He
was going In the direction of the Court- i
house and the Marshal followed him to
the Sheriff's office, where re- surrendered |
to Under Sheriff Brown.
Lederer speaks so brokenly that but few ]
men can understand him. When asked
to make a statement all he would say
was that his wife made him lots of !
trouble and he hoped she would die.
these things after having relieved his
deputy, Gately, from so delicate a task
as a "natural causes" death, so that he
could engineer things himself.
All things being ready, no reporters in
sight and no deputy to make a report
that might be awkward. Coroner Hill
brought on Dr. Guido Caglieri to tier
form the autopsy. Dr. Caglierl said
last night that, even before he put a
knife to the body, it appeared to be the
general belief of those present that the
girl had died from natural causes. He
examined her liver and found that it
was abnormally enlarged, which condi
tion, he says, betokened the drinking of
aromatic liqueurs. He found also in
flammation of the stomach, which be
trayed the same habit; the heart was
dilated and the liver showed signs of
recent congestion.
The autopsy stopped there, it being
concluded that the girl had died from
these conditions. Although it had been
reported by Dr. Levison that the girl
had taken poison (presumably lauda
num), the contents of the stomach were
not analyzed to determine this fact,
the Coroner, the mother and Sig. Bett
man professing themselves satisfied
that the dilation and congestion had
carried off the young woman.
"If the girl had taken laudanum,"
said Dr. Caglieri last night, "there was
only one way to determine it, and that
was to analyze the contents of the
stomach. We did not do this. For that
reason I cannot say that there was none
in the stomach. If there was, that
probably killed her and not the condi
tions I found."
Coroner Hill still thinks they did all
that was necessary in the case. He
professes to know, although Dr. Cag
lieri explains why he could not, that the
girl did not die from laudanum poison
ing. The Coroner is evidently trying to
live up to the half-yearly rep, he
made Tuesday to the Supervisors. He
concludes it by saying:
I have adopted a plan of holding Inquests nt
the homÂ«"s of deceased persona and find that
it Rive- a great deal of satisfaction to bereaved
relatives and friends. More than one-half of
the Inquests held by me since January 1. when
I took office, have been held at the homes of
deceased persona.
His finding in the case of Florence
Parker was eminently satisfactory to
Sig. Bettman and the other relatives of
the dead girl' hut it does not go down
with George Bailey.
CENSURE FOR HILL.
Board of Health Stops Illegal
Reports of Deaths.
The expose made by The Call yester
day morning of the peculiar action of
Coroner Hill in suppressing the facts
of the death of Florence Parker has
roused the Board of Health to action,
and measures have been taken to ren
der It impossible for the accommodat
ing Coroner to again oblige his politi
cal friends in a like manner. Â'.
, In the report which he handed in
last evening at the meeting of the
Board of Health Dr. Lav.lor embodied
the following suggestion:
"I also call your especial attention to
the absolute necessity of having some
safeguard thrown about the cremation
of bodies so as to .guard against the
possibility of a person dying from un
natural causes being cremated. I
would suggest that the bodies to be
thus disposed of should be so specified
on our burial permits from this office,
and the certificate should be received
at least twenty-four hours previous to
so disposing of bodies."
In support of this he said: "Cases
of unnatural deaths being reported as
natural are becoming altogether too
frequent. - By whose connivance It Is
made possible I do not say, but the
fact remains that several such, cases
have been brought to the attention of
this office. One in particular was told
of in one of this morning's papers the
case of a girl who took laudunum.
The Coroner reported that she died of
valvular trouble of the heart. An at
tempt was made to have her body cre
mated before the true cause of her
death was discovered, and It Is such
illegal action as that I am endeavoring
to put a stop to."
The members of the board discussed
the question at length and unanimous
ly decided that some such rule should
be established. When Dr. Lawlor's re
port was taken un for action It was
passed without dissent.

in line of promotion to commissioned
rank in the event of a vacancy.
Another method of securing recruits is
to offer commissions to men otherwise
qualified who will undertake to furnish
! in each case not less than forty men who
j can pass muster as soldiers and will en
! list for service in the Philippines. There
j have been several cases of this kind dur
i ing the past week.

! back. They want to know why there was
not a sufficient force present In the island
of Luzon to crush out the rebellion upon
, its first appearance and, stirred by sensa
tional newspaper stories and by the re
cent "round robin" of the offended news- j
paper correspondents, they are asking ;
whether the situation is even as good as >
had been reported, whether the Govern- ;
; ment has not allowed itself to be misled I
i and whether the military force -now being
I enlisted will surely be great enough for i
; the task in hand? These are the Inquiries j
j to which I purpose to submit an answer.
It should be borne in mind In the first
place that the Government's means of in-,
; formation concerning what has occurred :
I In th? Philippines are not confined to Gen- j
| eral Otis. The Navy Department has its
\ officers there. The President Is directly
j represented by Mr. Denby, who was for
fourteen years our Minister to China, and
by Professor Worcester, who resided In i
the Philippines for four or five years and â 
who knows the native character and hab
its. The Philippines campaign is receiv- !
ing the President's constant personal at- ;
tention. He Is In direct cable communica- 'â 
tion with Manila and receives daily re
ports from all sources.
The possibility of his being misled about
the facts in the case Is scarcely worth
consideration. The precise fact, as he ob
tains it, not only from General Otis but
from each of a dozen or more of his of
] ficial informants, Is that for a distance of
j fifty miles north of Manila and of twenty
j miles south of Manila and eastward into j
j I.aguna province, our armies hold the
i territory so that the insurgents are scat
| tered beyond our lines in bands of from '
j fifty to 500, their only considerable force I

ing. After loud subterranean noises the crater vomited forth
Sense columns of smoke, which were followed by enormous
X. l_ masses of sand. A strong earthquake shock occurred here at
2:20 o'clock this morning and was followed during the ensuing
fifteen minutes by a number of other severe shocks.
The damage done here by the earthquake shocks was slight, but at
the village of Rocca di Papa, fifteen miles southeast of Rome, it was
more serious. A number of houses in that place fell. A part of a church
was demolished at Castel-Gandolfo, on the northwest side of Mount Al
bano and fourteen miles southeast of Rome. No fatalities have been
reported. His Holiness, the Pope, was greatly alarmed by the shocks.
consisting of about 4000 men, who are en
camped in Northern Pampanga:
The southern army of the insurgents,
possibly 2000 strong, Is badly demoralized
by recent defeats. The Presidents ad
vices report to him that in a number of
Cities within the American lines local gov
ernments have been formed, which are
discharging their functions competently
and to the satisfaction of the people; that
the mass of the people desire peace and
American protection; that they no longer
flee on the approach of our troops, but
heartily welcome them; that the popu
lation within the American lines Is dense
and grows larger nil the while, and that
land cultivation Is going on extensively.
The President Is advised, and on this
point his information comes unanimously
from all the able men whose official ob
ligation is to keep the Government ac
curately Informed, that the only hope "7
the insurgents lies in the efforts that are
making to convince the people that a
change of government Is about to occur
In the United States favorable to the In
surgent cause; that there is general op
position among the American people to
the prosecution of the war and a fixed
purpose on the part of that political party
about to come into power to Withdraw
the American army and to recognize the
Government of Agulnaldo. This Idea la
being assiduously circulated by the In
surgent leaders, and It so far serves their
purpose as to enable them to maintain
their fortes In fairly strong array
There can be no question of the substan
tial truth and accuracy of this informa
tion It comes from too many different
sources -and from sources high and honor
able in character to admit of doubt, and
not even the testimony of the newspaper
correspondents who resent the interfer
ence of General Otis' unimaginative blue
pencil with their sensational stories can
stand against the official representatives
of the President's civil and military ad-
Nor is It an especially optimistic view
of the situation. It shows, Indeed, that a
great work has yet to be done and leads
back to the question why more has not
been already accomplished, and the ques
tion whether the preparations now going
forward will possibly Insure the creation
of a force sufficiently powerful for the
work that remains.
It is perfectly easy to explain why
the Government did not have a great
army at Manila when the Filipinos made
their first attack. It did not because It
could not. It was restrained by two cir
cumstancesâgood faith with Spain and
the laws of Congress under which tin*
army had been created. It must be re
membered that the American people were
not thinking of the Philippines when they
went to war with Spain. They were con
cerned with the affairs of Cuba. The pe
riod of actual warfare, moreover, was
short, and the French Embassador had
appeared at the White House with a pro
posal to end the war almost before tho
army had been equipped to take the field.
Now, at that time. In July, 1898, we had
sent to the Philippines nearly 20,000 men.
Admiral Dewey had advised the Govern
ment that 5000 would be sufficient. It
was General Miles' opinion that 12,000
were surely enough, but the 'President,
acting upon his own wise -judgment, has
dispatched 20.000. The only work then
expected of them was to tight and de
feat the Spaniards at Manila.
Continuing, the statement recalls
the negotiation of the peace protocol
through the French Embassador, re
calls the subsequent battle at Manila,
by which the American forces gained
by force what the protocol had peace
fully conceded, and says:
If, under the terms of the peace protocol,
the Spaniards had quietly marched out of
Manila and we had quietly marched in,
the two forces in full strength peacefully
awaiting the conclusions of the negotia
tions at Paris, we might perhaps have
withdrawn from the Philippines with dig
nity and without the Impairment of in
ternational obligations.- But. having de
stroyed their authority over the Philippine
people and having forcibly placed our
selves in their stead as a Government, tho
status quo became impossible of restora
tion, and from that moment the with
drawal of the American army and navy
would have meant the abandonment of
the island to utter anarchy, misery and
misrule, 'tfyy
This view compelled the course that was
taken by our commissioners at Paris and
justified the President in having assem
bled so considerable a force at Manila. His
power to add to the force was now gone.
The question of the future of the Philip
pinesâwhether they should belong, to
Spain or to the United Statesâ had passed
into the hands of the Peace Commission
and, of course, neither country was at
liberty to change the conditions mtil thj
Peace Commission had acted and its ac
tion had been approved. Further expedi
tions of men to the Philippines would
have been a plain violation of the terms
of the protocol, but. if that wholly suln
cient reason had been wanting, there was
another, and this other involved the most
trying and troublesome condition with
which the Government has had to con
tend, tf-tf.
The men then under arms and available
for use, whether In the Philippines or in
tli<--\\,st Indies, had all been enlisted for
the period of the war. By the terms of
their enlistment they were- free of every
obligation to the Government upon Its
proclamation of peace. The President
knew better than any one else that peace
was assured and that all his soldiers not
only those who stood ready to go to the
Philippines but the t-u.OOO men then there
as wellâ were by law to be mustered out
of the service on the instant when/ he
made official announcement that the
Spanish war was over.
Continuing, the statement reviews
the legislation of April, 1898, by which
38,000 regulars were added to the 27,000
who composed the army in times of
peace, and says:
Hut after the peace protocol had been
signed not a man of them could be used
In the Philippines more than the force
then there. And who could then foresee
that this force was not sufficient? A con
flict with the Filipinos was not then an
ticipated. Their army, it is true, had been
assembled on the outskirts of Manila. But
with respect to the Americans it was gen
erally supposed to bo a friendly rather
than a hostile army. Its leaders had been
ardent with the assurance of their friend
ship and confidence. They had proclaimed
a republic, to be sure, and had asserted
a government, but there was nothing in
the attitude they then assumed that
could justify the belief that their guns
were going to be aimed at the flag that
had set them free.
Even had the President been at liberty,
under the terms of the peace protocol,
to Increase the Philippine army, and even
had the men available for service there
been ready for transportation, no wise
counselor would have advised sending
them. Indeed, the very thing that
brought on the conflict with Aguinaldo
was the dispatch of a small force intend
ed to take the places of those whoso
terms of enlistment had expired and who
had already been brought home.
From the hour when Congress assem
bled in December the President endeav
ored to draw its attention to the situa
tion in which the Government would be
left upon the proclamation of peace. In
one message he delivered to the Senate
the peace treaty. In another he warned
Congress that as soon as the treaty was
ratified and the ratification exchanged he
would be compelled to muster out the
troops at Manila. An army bill drawn
in conformity with the Government's view
was already prepared and was urgently
pressed upon Congress. The country will
remember the bitter opposition it en
countered from the Democratic party.
Democratic members who did not dare to
assume the responsibility of defeating the
peace treaty, who would not even consent
to take the responsibility of opposing the
acquisition of the Philippines, arrayed
themselves with' the rest of the party
against the army bill.
The Democratic leaders in both House
and Senate had the bewildering hardihood
to declare that the increased forces asked
for were to be employed not in Manila but
here in our country. The troops were not
needed in Manila, these leaders said, and
they actually argued that the administra
tion was using the unlikely menace of
war in the Philippines as a means of ex
acting from Congress an enormous reg
ular army for the suppression of liberty
at home. It may surprise intelligent per
sons to know that this sort of talk could
be indulged in upon the floors of Congress,
but there were weeks and weeks of it,
and meanwhile the Insurgents were gath
ering an army of 30,000 men, were growing
more and more belligerent in their atti
tude and every day brought nearer tho
time when peace would be proclaimed
with Spain and the Government be left
without a legal claim to the services of
a single soldier in Manila.
"It was the 2d of March before Con
gress passed the army bill, and the war
in the Philippines had been going on for
four weeks. When the country considers
this fact and realizes that the 80.000 Amer
ican troops then in Manila had been as
sembled there, not at all in anticipation
of a campaign against the Filipinos, but
wholly and solely for the purpose of de
feating the Spaniards, and that the Presi
dent had been told by no less authority
than Admiral Dewey that for the purpose
Â£000 men would be sufficient, surely his
foresight and good judgment will be
everywhere approved."

ANDERSON DENIES
ZIALCITA'S STATEMENT
FORT THOMAS. Ky., July 19â :
eral Thomas M. Anderson, commander
of the Department of the bakes, was
seen here to-day by a representative of
the Associated Press and was asked for j
a statement concerning the Minneapolis ;
Times' report from its Manila corre
spondent in which the Filipino peace
commissioner, Zialcita, was quoted as
saying that General Anderson at a din
ner given in his honor at Cavite had said
that the Americans had not come to
the Philippines for the purpose of tak
ing a foot of territory with a view of
permanent possession, but for the pur
pose of giving th"-> Filipinos their inde
pendence. General Anderson promptly
and decidedly said he had never used ,
any such language. He stated that
when he reached Manila he had no
transportation, forage and fuel, and he
applied to Aguinaldo for these things.
This drew him Into a correspondence
with Aguinaldo. from which the gen
eral soon saw that Aguinaldo's purpose
was to put every obstacle in the way
of furnishing the things needed by the
United States army, and at the same
time lead the United States, through
General Anderson, into some sort of
recognition of the Filipino govern
ment. In -that correspondence the gen
enral says he made it plain to Aguin
aldo that he was there in a purely
military capacity, with no authority
whatever to bind the United States by
any act of recognition; that his inter
course with Aguinaldo was purely mili
tary, both being opposed by a common
enemy. He also pointed out that as no
nation had recognized the Filipino
government, or had given it belligerent
rights, it was impossible for him to do
anything of the kind.
"I want it distinctly stated," said the
General, "that I at no time made such
statement as is attributed to me by
Zialcita. Another matter I wish to set
right. It has been charged- that I -had
clashed with General Otis, and it has
even been said that I was recalled on
that account. There was no clash be
tween me and General Otis. It is true
I made a suggestion with regard to at
tacking Â«he Filipinos because they
were intrenching in our front and that
General Otis did not act upon it. but
this made no clash. General Otis may
have been acting under direct orders
from Washington. As for my recall,
that was dated in January and hostil
ities did not begin until February, so
it could have had no connection with
the active campaign, as suggested."
OTIS OFFERS BRIBES
TO THE FILIPINOS
NEW YORK. July 19.â The World
says: Major General Otis is pursuing
the Spanish policy of bribery to weaken
the Filipinos. He has offered a reward
of $60. Mexican silver (about $30 in
American 'currency), to every native
who shall surrender to the United
States a firearm of any description.
This information came in a private let
ter received in this city from an officer
on duty in the islands.
MEXICANS KIDNAPED,
TRIED AND EXECUTED
Smuggled Across the Boundary With
the Connivance of Ameri
can Officials.
TUCSON, Ariz., July 19.â A Nogales
special to the Star says that the Grand
Jury discovered that four Mexicans
had been recently kidnaped at Nogalea
with the connivance of two officials of
Santa Cruz County and handed over to
the Mexican authorities without due |
process of law. The four men were j
summarily tried and shot by Mexican I
authorities.
An effort to Indict District Attorney i
Harlow on account of the outrage |
failed. It is alleged the kidnaped !
Mexicans were rough characters. This
means was used to dispose of them !
with the understanding that the kid
naping and execution should be sup- i
pressed or the relations between Amer- <
icans and Mexicans on both sides of
the line, which are now very cordial, j
might be disturbed if official action j
were taken by the American authori- !
ties.
SEEKING DEWEY AS
A STANDARD BEARER
W. C. Whitney Said to Have Gone
to Europe to Ask the Admiral
to Bun for President.
NEW YORK, July 19.â A special to
the Sun from Chicago says: There is
talk here of trying to place the name
of George Dewey at the head of the
Democratic national ticket in the next
campaign. Dewey Is declared to be the
hope of the Democrats of the East, who
forfeited their leadership by opposing
the silver issue.
O. H. P. Belmont of New York is au
thority for the statement that Eastern
Democrats are trying to Induce Dewey
to become a candidate for the Presi
dency. He says they have sent "Wil
liam C. Whitney to Europe, ostensibly
to Invite Dewey to a dinner in New
York, but in reality to invite htm to
become the standard-bearer of re
united Democracy. "â

COMBINATION
OF RAILROADS
Trunk Line From Atlan
tic to Pacific.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, July 19.â The Herald
says: While Wall street has been fig
uring out new acquisitions for the Van
derbilts and concocting alliances be
tween the New York Central and Penn
sylvania and Morgan lines, there has
been quietly under way one -of the big
gest deals that has been brought out
for several years. It will involve the
combination of at least four prominent
railroads, and perhaps include two or
three more, making a complete trunk
line from the Atlantic to the Pacific. It
the plans are carried out. a few months
at most will see the establishment of
the first transcontinental system to be
undertaken in the United States, the
combination being on the basis of the
shortest route between terminals.
It is not possible at this time to give
all of the details, but it is now known
that the scheme involves a merging of
several properties in which K. 11. Har
riman, Kuhn, Loeb & Co. and Speyer
& Co. are interested, and with their
friends exert a controlling Influence.
Among these properties are the Union
Pacific, Illinois Central, Chicago ami
Alton, Chicago Terminal Transfer
Company, Oregon Short Line, Oregon
Railway and Navigation Company, and
Baltimore and Ohio, It is asserted in
some quarters that the Great Northern
will come in. but it is considered
doubtful, although James J. Hill is
.closely associated with several of the
gentlemen who are prominent in the
railroads mentioned.
â¢ This combine will give a compact
system and bring about a revolution in
traffic alliances. The Union Pacific is
the keystone. Its closest connection at
present is the Chicago and Northwest
ern, and for a long lime it has been the
prevailing opinion in Wall street that
the Vanderbilts would attach both the
Northwestern and Union Pacific to tic
growing New York Central system.
The Northwestern directors have
hurriedly considered the advisability of
extending their Fremont branch to Og
den to connect with' the Central Pa
cific, which is controlled by the South
ern Pacific. cut off from the Union
Pacific, the Northwestern will find no
road to turn to for Pacific Coast busi
ness that does not parallel it for a con
siderable distance. Thus, with the
Northwestern extending its Fremont,
Elkhorn and Missouri River railroad
! from Fort Casper to Ogden in order to
| fight the Union Pacific, and the North
i crn Pacific forced to protect itself
! against the Oregon lines, which have
! recently been acquired by the Union
Pacific, there is likely to be a lively
time among the great transcontinental
rivals in the near future.
The new deal means that the era of
: exclusive affiliations between the Union
I Pacific and Northwestern is at an end.
: It indicates that while the Union Pa
! cific has been turning most of its east
bound traffic over to one road it may
now divide it between the Illinois Cen
; tral and the Alton. As a result the
[ Union Pacific may be expected to get
I much more westbound business, for
: both the Illinois Central and the Alton
I will turn over the traffic to it.

SPREADS TO GOTHAM
SERIOUS RIOTS
IN NEW YORK
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, July 19.â New York trol- >"â¦>
ley men joined the Brooklyn trolley men *
to-day In their big strike. The center of' i>
operations In New York City was on Sec- " (
SCENE OF THE L ROAD EXPLOSION. '
Early yesterday morning two dynamite bombs were exploded under the Elevated station at Thirty-sixth
street and Fifth avenue, Brooklyn. Considerable damage was done in the vicinity by the force of the explo
sion. General Master Workman Parsons, who is superintending the strike on the trolley lines, denounces
the occurrence and promises to aid the authorities in bringing the guilty persons to justice.
ond avenue. The excitement in Brooklyn
centered in the vicinity of Thirty-sixth
and Fifth avenue, where dynamite was
used this morning in an attempt to blow
down the elevated structure.
The rioting that took place in New York j
this afternoon and to-night was of a ser- j
ious nature, infinitely fiercer than what j
has taken place in the borough across the i
river. Scores of people were severely in- i
jured in the Second avenue district. To
night that great thoroughfare was crowd
ed with a ring, howling mob, almost its
entire length.
The great tenements gave forth their j
work'ngmen residents, who backed up the i
strikers in many a fierce struggle with !
the police, and with the men were many
women and still greater numbers of chil
dren. They stoned every car that passed
over the tracks. They hurled rocks and i
chunks of Iron and vegetables from tno
roofs of houses and from the windows;
they barricaded the reel with paving |
stones, tore up the street irons, choked,
up the slot with wire and spiked and
blocked the thoroughfare; they had many
a hand-to-hand conllict with the 600 pa
trolmen that had been placed along the
line.
Of the injured the exact number cannot
be known. Several policemen were remov- i
ed to hospitals with broken bones and
torn scalps. At least one striker, or strike
sympathizer, ha/1 his skull fractured and
a boy had his skull fractured, Innumer
able passengers on the cars received bad
wounds and it was impossible for passen
gers on Second avenue to go much above
Fourteenth street. The cars that ran the
gauntlet had many windows broken and
were badly battered.
It was the hope of the strikers to make
a deep Impression by their success on
Second avenue, and so far as rioting was
concerned, they and their sympathizers
made it. .. _
On the other lines throughout New
York the strike was not at any time
prominent throughout the day. To-night,
however, the motormen on the Eighth
avenue line to the number of 100 or more I
organized and declared a strike. They !
thereupon set about to persuade their fel- !
low workmen to leave their cars and with j
sufficient success to have running on only
an hourly schedule before midnight.
To-morrow they declare Eighth avenue
will also be tied up. The officials of the
Sixth avenue line made the statement to
night that the cars on this avenue were
moving the same as usual. _
Madison, Lexington and Fourth avenues'
were but little affected to-day. but more
is promised to-morrow. In the borough
of Brooklyn the strikers made some gains
so far as the diminishing of trolley car
traffic was concerned; fewer cars were I
running on the lines. But the dynamite
outrage in the early morning hours was
undoubtedly a severe setback to the strik
ers. The police, in connection with the
blowing down of the two elevated col
umns, moved rapidly and made more than
a score of arrests, sixteen of the men be
ing held by the courts. The strikers deny
any knowledge of the dynamiting, and
General Master Workman Parsons has
offered a reward of $500 if it can be proven
that a striker is responsible for it. Presi
dent Rossiter of tin- Brooklyn Rapid
Transit Company has offered a reward of
$1000 for the conviction of the perpetra
tors. ."â ''
Several thousand policemen are to-night
guarding thÂ« power bouse and the plant of
the companies Involved in the strike. The
police arrangements to take care, of riot
ers have been excellent so far, but the
surging mobs on Second avenue to-night
were too much for them. More than a
hundred arrests were made and probably
as great a number of persons as that
were injured by the free use of the night
stick but even Chief Devery believes, to
gether with his inspectors, that more
forcible measures than that will have to
be adopted. New York has not seen such
rioting in many a day
General .Master Workman Parsons an
nounced to-night that he will to-morrow
issue a call to all the presidents and sec- j
retaries of all the labor unions in Greater
New York to meet Friday night in the |
Grand Central Palace to take some action I
to sustain the street car men in their pres- |
ent fight.
PROSECUTION OF THE
ALLEGED DYNAMITERS
NEW YORK, July 19. -/ There was little
change ln the Brooklyn strike situation
to-day. The Brooklyn Rapid Transit
Company officials claim to have operated
from 50 To 90 per cent of their surface
cars on all lines during the night, but
all cars on all lines were stopped at mid
night and not a car reached Brighton
Beach on the company's line since the
strike began.
The damage to the Fifth-avenue ele
vated structure in Brooklyn caused by the
dynamite explosion was repaired suf
ficiently to allow a resumption of traffic
or: that road early this morning.
Sixteen of the men whose records were
looked up by the detectives were subse
quently charged with conspiracy. An
employe of the Brooklyn Rapid Transit
Company testified that he had seen dyna
mite in their possession. â -..,.-
All the men, Including five previously
committed for examination to-morrow,
were arraigned before Magistrate Bren
ner. The charge of vagrancy against th 3
men was dismissed and the entire party
was held for examination Monday on a
charge of conspiracy. Bail was fixed at
$75"' in each case.
General Master Workman Parsons said
to-day: "I condemn most emphatically
the blowing up of the L structure in
Brooklyn. If done by strikers the guilty
ones will be repudiated by the organiza
tion. This savors much, however, of tho
old tactics employed by companies in for
mer strikes to create public sympathy.
This is not a far-fetched idea. I hay*
no doubt that every extreme will be re
sorted to in order, apparently, to justify
the calling out of the State troops to as
sist in enabling these companies to evade
the law." j'ii!"'*
President Rossiter to-day declared that
matters concerning the strike were pro
gresing satisfactory to the company. *_.ne
strike in New York would have no ef
fect one way or the other on the Brook
lyn Rapid Transit System. He acknowl
edged that he is still in need of about 1500
men to make up his full quota. About 250
men were put to work yesterday. Mr.
Rossiter averred that he did not want
men to come here from other cities to
take the places of the strikers, as there
were plently of experienced motormen and
conductors in Brooklyn to fill the vancan
cies.
There are several disturbances on the
Second avenue line. At One Hundred and
Sixteenth street, a spike was driven in
the trolley slot and the road blocked. The
same thing was done later at One Hun
dred and Second street.
Frank Lalv, a motorman, was induced
to quit work at One Hundred and Six
teenth street and Second avenue. The
motor handles were stolen and tho road
was stalled until assistance could be ob
tained from the depot. A squad of police
dispersed the strikers. Laly was arrested
for disorderly conduct.
"William Askley. employed as an Investi
gator by the Brooklyn Rapid Transit
Company, made an affidavit to-day in
which he said that he had attended a
meeting of the strikers late Monday night
at which the statement was made that
unless the elevated people joined the
strikers they would purchase dynamite
and blow up the elevated structure. Ask
ley affirms that sixteen of the men ar
rested this morning were at the meeting
and indorsed the suggestion with shouts
of approval. The police claim that they
have evidence that these men purchased
the dynamite used this morning.
BIG RUN OF SALMON.
Columbia River Fishermen Making
Enormous Hauls.
ASTORIA. Or.. July 19.â Contrary to ex
pectations, a heavy run of salmon has
commenced ln the river and the canneries
and cold-storage houses are unable to
handle the fish received with their present
force of employes. It Is generally believed
by Ushers and packers that the run will
continue throughout the season and that
the pack will be but little- if any short
of the average.
The present heavy run is & veritable
Klondike for the fishermen. One boat
brought in 4000 pounds of salmon to the
Co-operative Cannery yesterday. Its two
occupants' making $200 on their night's
work. Catches of from 1000 to 2500 pounds
are numerous, while the average Is nearly
750 pounds. The canneries pay 5 cents,
but the cold storages are offering 6 cents
and some of the men fishing for the latter
are making as high as $100 a night. The
quality of the salmon now being taken Is
unsurpassed, * _ <

SOME CARS RUN
AT CLEVELAND
Little Change in the
Strike Situation.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CLEVELAND, July 19.â There was
little change In the street car strike
situation to-day. Cars were being run
at irregular intervals. No violence had
been reported since early last night,
when a switch was blown up on Mur
ray Hill by the explosion of a big
charge of dynamite. President Ever
ett of the Big Consolidated Company
declares that he is well pleased with the
situation.
"There Is nothing to arbitrate," said
Mr. Everett. "There are plenty of men
who are glad to take the places of the
strikers and we shall have their places
all filled within a few days."
Mr. Everett asserted that men were
constantly arriving from other cities to
take the places of Strikers.-;^;
The strikers have announced that
they will make a statement to the pub
lic to-morrow.
The 600 longshoremen who went on
strike at the Erie docks yesterday are
still out. A number of vessels loaded
with Iron ore are tied up at the docks
waiting to be unloaded. A meeting of
the strikers will be held to-day to con
solder the situation. The indications
are that the strike will be of short du
ration. . . -â  " 'â '
CHAMBERS HAS NOT
YET STEPPED DOWN
American Chief Justice of Samoa De
lays the Sending of His
Resignation.
WASHINGTON, July 19.â Chief Jus
tice Chambers of Samoa has not ad
vised the State Department of his In
tention to resign his office, as reported
lin the press dispatches coming from
Apia via Auckland. In fact, the de
partment is so far without official ad-
J vices from Mr. Chambers or any mem
bers of the Samoan Commission by the
latest steamer, which inclines the offi
cials to the belief that the fights said
I to have taken place in Samoa among
; adherents of the late aspirants for the
i throne must have been small matters
'< and without international significance,
las seems to be Indicated by the re
ported co-operation between the Ger
man and British naval commanders in
making arrests of the malcontents.
The report of Mr. Chambers' Intention
to resign, if it should turn out to be
l true, would be no surprise to the offi
! cials here, as It Is pointed out that his
position "was untenable after the con
clusion of the arrangement by the Sa
i moan Commissioners. It is suspected
1 that Mr. Chambers' resignation pos
sibly was dated to take effect upon his

JONES' RESIGNATION
â * â
Said to Have Been Sent in a Letter
to One of the Western
, Members. '%>
Special Dispatch to The Call.
AUSTIN, Tex., July 19.â A sensational
j bit of political gossip is contained in a
I letter received here to-day by a promi
j nent State Democratic politician from a
well-known Bryan Democratic leader now
in the East. It is to the effect that an
element of the National Democratic Com
mittee is seeking- to elect ex-Governor
James S. Hogg of Texas to the position
of chairman of the committee to succeed
Hon. James K. Jones. .
This letter states further that a letter
from Chairman Jones, resigning from the
i chairmanship, Is In the hands of one of
I the Western members of the committee,
and that the reason set forth for so do
! ing is that ill health prevents him from
! entering into the, active work of organ
j izing the party's forces for the great cam
paign soon, to be waged. ..
j i The proposed change of the committee's
I chairman is said to have been urged by
I Bryan, and Hogg is to be rewarded for
I his service in bursting the Van Wycke
I boom at the Tammany Fourth of July
celebration. Bryan and Hogg have been
i intimate political friends for several
J years.
After Hogg's free silver speech and
Brvan's triumph at the Tammany cele
bration. Chairman Jones was made ac
quainted with the situation, and his resig
nation letter came over from Europe on
the next steamer. The letter concludes
by stating that a number of members
of the National Committee will antag
onize Hogg's election, but that it is
! thought Bryan's influence will prevail.
Hogg is now at an Eastern summer re
j sort, awaiting the result of the political
i move at Chicago.
In confirmation of the letter referred to
' advices were received here this evening
that Hon. James G. Dudley, the Texas
member of the committee, offers to resign
| to give Hogg a place, and that the latter's
: appointment will be made.
LINING UP FOR THE
STRUGGLE AT CHICAGO
CHICAGO, July 19.â Acting Chairman
W. J. Stone of Missouri will call to order
the Democratic National Committee at
10 o'clock to-morrow morning in the
Sherman House. W. J. Bryan will prob
ably sit as a committeeman, arrangements
having been made to furnish him with a
proxy. John P. Altgeld holds the proxy of
William H. White of Washington. His :
presence in the committee may cause
trouble, for it Is believed that Thomas ;
Gahan, member of the committee of Illi
nois, may question Mr. Altgeld's right to !
represent a Democratic committeeman.
Apparently Mr. Altgeld Is desirous of
avoiding trouble. He said to-day that he
did not care to sit in the committee if any
of the members resented it, and accord
ingly telegraphed Mr. White suggesting
that some other proxy be named.
"If I do not hear from Mr. White," said !
the ex-Governor to-night, "or if he in
sists that I represent him, I shall do so.
But I have no desire to bring local af
fairs into the committee."
This discord between the Harrison and
Altgeld factions of the local Democratic
party was the salient feature of today's
talk around the hotels. If Acting Chair
man Stone's wishes are carried out, and ;
j apparently most of the committeemen are
with him, the factional differences' local
to Chicago . and New York will not be
1 brought before the committee In any
form. It is probable that a new rule will
jbe adopted to-morrow providing that
i whenever a* vacancy occurs In the j
National the State committee shall j
elect a member of the National
Committee to fill such vacancy. Another
rule which is under consideration gives
the National Committee the right to
judge of qualifications of its own mem
bers. ' Still another rule is being talked of
Which would force ex-Governor Altgeld
out of his position as a member of the
"auxiliary committee," which was orig
inally composed of Mr. Altgeld, Senators
Jones, Teller and Allen and William K.
Stone.
This rule will provide that all commit
tees, auxiliary and otherwise of the Na
tional Committee, shall be made up only
of the big committee. It Is Intimated that
â  the resignations- of Senators Teller and
; Allen and ex-Governor Stone as members
i of the "auxiliary" or Ways and Means
i Committee will be handed in to-morrow.
: Senator Jones' absence in Europe, will
leave Mr. Altgeld the sole remaining
i member of this committee and an at
tempt may be made to force him out and
rcoigamze the committee with only Dem
ocrats as members, leaving out the Pop
ulists and Silver Republicans".
Among the prominent Democrats here
to-day were: George Fred Williams of
Massachusetts, Oliver H. P. Belmont of
New York. Senator Francis M. Cockrell
of Missouri. Colonel L. Victor .Baughan
of Maryland, proxy for Arthur P. Gor-*
I man; Clark Howell of Georgia, William
Goebel, Democratic candidate for Gov
l ernor of Kentucky; William R. Burke,
proxy for Committeeman Dwyer of Cali
fornia, and John F. Shafroth of Colorado.
THREATEN TO FORM A NEW
NATIONAL COMMITTEE
CHICAGO, July 19.â The Tribune to
morrow "will say: Plans have been ar
ranged by the uncompromising silver
Democrats which may lead to the forma
tion of a new national committee. After
several conferences. In which John P. Alt
geld, George Fred Williams, James P.
Tarvln and several other leading bimetal
lists were the principal participants, a
programme for to-day's proceedings was
promulgated. It calls for respective
meetings at noon of the three bimetallic
organizations, having authorized commit
tees, all of whom are now in Chicago,
and of the Illinois and New York Chicago
platform Democrats. Thereafter a joint
conference will be held, probably at the
Unity building, to confirm whatever ac
tion may be taken by those bodies. Then
a committee will apply to the National
Committee for a hearing. They expect
to be treated and given an opportunity
to present their wishes.
No action, however, will be taken by
the National Committee until the visitors
have retired.
George Fred Williams will move that
the proposition of the bimetallists to co
operate with the national committee in
organizing campaign work be accepted.
If the motion is adopted everything will
then go along smoothly and In the most
harmonious manner. If it is rejected they
will be prepared to act independently.
It was said that their plans contemplate
in the event they are turned down by the
national committee the organization at
once of a national committee of their own.
It will be formed before they quit Chi
cago. Then an address will be issued to
the Democrats of the country informing
them that this new national committee
is the one that stands for the Chicago
platform and the only one that should be
recognized by the simon pure silver Dem
ocrats of the land. *- tf tfy ..-â -
William Prentiss, one of John P. Alt
geld's most intimate friends, called on
Acting Chairman Stone of the National
Democratic Committee to-night and de

SECRETARY KEVANE
IS AT WORK UNDER
AN ASSUMED NAME
Trying to Aid Gage in Attempt to
Remove Dr. Gardner From
Napa Asylum.
NAPA, July 19.â investigation into the affairs of the Napa Asy
lum for the Insane was commenced to-day by Secretary Kevane
and Walter F. Parker, expert of the State Board of Examiners.
Whether or not the investigation will be fraught with developments
of a sensational nature is purely a matter for conjecture at this time,
but certain it is. however, that Governor Gage and his representatives are
particularly desirous for political or personal reasons of airing the charges
that have been made against the management of the hospital. Secretary
Kevane, who arrived here yesterday and registered at the Palace Hotel
under an assumed name, spent the day rummaging about town collecting in
formation concerning the management of the hospital from discharged em
ployes. The prevailing opinion here is that Gage is hot after Dr. Gard
ner's scalp. It Is said that Gage is particularly anxious to drop the doc
tor's official head in the basket because of certain rumors which are said
to have reached his ears to the effect that Gardner did not support him
in the recent campaign.
Secretary Kevane visited the asylum this afternoon and had quite a
lengthy interview with Dr. Gardner. After it was concluded Dr. Gardner
drove Kevane to the depot and he took the afternoon train, presumably
for Sacramento. Expert Parker is still here and Kevane will probably re
turn on the morning train.
if the National Committee at Its meeting
to-morrow removed P. J. Devlin from his
position as press agent of that commit
tee the act would be construed by the bi
metallists as hostile to the Chicago plat
form.
Neither Mr. Prentiss nor Mr. Stone
would give the result of the conference in
Stone's room, but the Altgeld men de
clared that P. J. Devlin would not be re
moved and that Thomas Gahen and Car
ter Harrison would not triumph.

BABE STARTED THE FIRE.
How Rancher Harris' Infant Son
Lost His Life.
SALINAS, July 19.â Coroner Muller has
made as thorough Investigation as pos
sible into the circumstances of the death
of Edwin Harris, the four-year-old son
of D. A. Harris, a rancher near San Lu
cas who was burned alive in a granary
fire' last week. The real cause of the
fire can, of course, never be known, but
from Investigation it appears that the
little boy was left in charge of his sis
ter aged 15 years. While she was in the
hov e the baby wandered to the granary,
about 200 feet" away, and from her story
must have obtained matches and thereby
caused the conflagration. She asserted
she heard no screams and In fact did not
know her brother was in the burning
structure until after it had been de
stroyed. â '._..

TO PRESERVE THE
AMERICAN TREE
Forestry Commission in
Session.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, July 19.â The seven
teenth annual convention of the Ameri
can Forestry Association opened in this
city at 8 o'clock to-night. Secretary of
Agriculture James Wilson, who is presi
dent of the association, has been un
avoidably detained. In his absence Ab
bott Kinney, the vice president for Cali
fornia, called the convention to order
and delivered the address of welcome on
behalf of the State and city. Governor
Gage, ex-Senator White and Congress
man Waters were to have delivered ad
dresses of welcome, but letters of regret
from these gentlemen were read.
Three addresses were delivered that
covered the wide range of forestry, the
preservation of forests, the remedy
against fires and the question of sheep
herding. W. S.'Melick said, but two
forestry stations were maintained in
California. Governor Budd had vetoed
the appropriation bill that provided
funds to sustain them and they were
kept alive now in a desultory manner.
"The forest fires are the greatest
menace," declared the speaker, "and
the object of this convention should be
to demand national legislation that
would afford relief. The State should
revise its laws so that the guilty could
be punished and the meritorious re
warded. We should plant trees and
take care of them and study methods
for preservation."
The principal lecture was delivered
by Gifford Pinchot, United States For
ester, upon "Forestry." The speaker
illustrated his theme with two scores of
notable slides.
"California takes more Interest in its
forests than any other State in the
Union except New York," declared Pin
chot, "and it is the duty of Californians
to preserve this reputation. California
can formulate a policy, but it should
also define one. It is stated that in
California not one in a hundred timber
claims is planted according to law. Yet
the Forestry Commission is willing to
send expects to aid the planter of tim
ber. Over 4700 forest fires have oc
curred during the present century, and
these are traceable to the Indians In
most cases. While forest fires are our
greatest menace, the sheep herder is
the greatest enemy to forest growth.
Sheep should be grazed only where tim
bers are not expected to be reproduced,"
J. B. Lippincott of the United States
Geological Survey delivered a lecture on
"The Bitter Root River Forest Reser
vation," and by views showed how the
forests were denuded.
Three sessions will be held to-mor
row. As the Government scientists pro
nounce the plan of water storage feas
ible to reclaim arid lands, memorials
will be introduced praying for national
aid to irrigation and storage reservoirs.
To carry out the plans of the committee
it Is probable an active committee will
be appointed to go to Washington and
lay before Congress the need for the
appropriation of necessary funds.
The delegates present, include Lucius
A. Booth. Oakland; W. W. Everett and
George H. Maxwell. San Francisco; *C.
L. Corey and Charles H. Shinn. Berke
ley; Professor M. H. Buckham, presi
dent of Vermont University; Professor
W. H. Wiley, chief chemist of the De
partment of Agriculture; Edward
Mead, United States Irrigation Com
mission; C. A. Keffer, S. B. Green, A. J.
McClatchle, F. H. Newell and C. C.

AUSTIN, Tex., July 19.â The pistol car
rying habit ln Texas, which has been the

CHOKING CAUSED
AN INMATE'S DEATH
STOCKTON, July 19.â J. W. Thomas, an
aged Inmate of. the Stockton State Hos
pital for the Insane, was found dead In
his room this forenoon, and the . Inquest
which was held this evening developed the
fact that his death was caused by a chok
ing which he had received some time dur
ing. the preceding two days.
No witness could be found who had
known of the man having, been in trou- i
ble, and the knowledge of the cause of
death was obtained through an autopsy
which showed that the cartelages of the
throat had been crushed. The injury
showed that It had been Inflicted some
time before death resulted, as a puss sack
had been formed In the throat which was
terribly swollen.
The man came to the Institution about
nine years ago from Sacramento, and
none of his relatives or friends are !
known. He was 61 years of age and was !
never known to have had any trouble
with either attendants or patients.

Funny Things Seen at Camp Fallon.
approval every time he stopped the
spheroid by falling to the ground and al
lowing it to collide with his rotund form.
The genial medico played left field, and
although he bad five chances he did not
m.ike over five errors. Father Dempsey's
catch of a fly ball set the bleachers ring
ing for fully Aye minutes. Whenever that
popular priest came to bat he was ten
dered an ovation. Three hits, a base on
balls, four stolen base's arid two runs was
his record for the morning. Captain Hop
per was so Impressed with the reverend
gentleman's ability as a player that he
signed him for the season. Captain Mono
ban played she!!, and all those lie let
pass him were taken by the left fielder.
Lieutenant Hanley persisted In going to
sleep in center field and lost many
chances to distinguish himself. He seemed
contented to allow Dr. Morrisey to do the
work. Major McCarthy's graceful form
was seen to advantage on the initial bag.
Some of the ladies thought it a shame
that he should injure his nice hands with
a horrid ball. Dr. Sullivan played hard to
win, as he had a bet with a young lady
from Capitola. Although she lost, the
jolly medico sympathized with her during
their walk back to that famous resort.
Captain Mclntyre's glasses handicapped
him in catching. Lieutenant Kelly's arm
gave out after the second inning and. he
retired from the box in favor of Lieuten
ant Vlnnie Carroll, who gave Innumerable
bases on balls, bit tin- batters and com
mitted all kinds of crimes, but redeemed
himself by heavy batting. Adjutant
"Jack" Duffy was cleverly bunkoed by
Captain Powers. When Puffy reached
first he did not know Powers had the ball
In his possession, and when he stepped
off the bag he was promptly put out. He
was so chagrined at buying the gilded
brick that he went off into a comer and
kicked himself. No amount of kindly
words could bring back the smiles to ills
face the rest of -the game.
In the five- innings played Levy, who
pitched for Captain Hopper's aggregation,
gave, only nine men their bases on balls,
bit four men and had twenty bits made
off his delivery, and -Is proud of his rec
ord. Following was the line-up:

The reception and ball given to-night
under the auspices of the Young Ladies'

friends of the cadets and dancing was
kept up until a late hour. The exhibition

At 2:30 the board met and settled ;
down to business. All was cut and I
dried, and, under the direction of

like a greased slate at a ward primary.
The minutes of the last meeting were
read, and then McNaughton read his
list of nominations for the various posi
tions of the faculty. Leavitt moved its

The report of the Alumni committee 1

came up. On motion of Pierce
it was read in full. During the
reading Leavitt said he had to'
leave to catch a train. At this the
other members demurred. He left, but .
returned In a half hour, having failed \
to make connection with the train.
At the conclusion of the reading a
discussion arose as to the manner of
disposing of the report. Short wanted
it left to the executive committee to re
port at a future meeting. Superinted"
ent Kirk said the charges were very
serious, and he intimated he would like
to hear from McNaughton, who, was
present, but the latter did not answer.
Eli Wright, a member of the Investi
gation committee, said that since the
report was filed a number of letters
were received from Tempe, Ariz., that
tended to substantiate the charges
against the character of McNaughton"
Leavitt intimated the commit to had not
acted in fairness, and had received a
number of letters favorable to Mc-
Naughton and had suppressed them.
Wright denied this, and he also de
nied that he had heard the charges had
been Investigated in Arizona. President
Brown said McNaughton had. in a let
ter to the alumni committee, said he
would demand a full Investigation of
the charges, and asked McNaughton if
he had done so. McNaughton replied he
had not, but would do so right away.
and immediately retired to his private
office. However, it was not done.
After many plans for investigation
were discussed, a motion of Leavitt to
hold it at an open meeting of the board,
to which all persons interested would
be invited, the date to be July 31, at 10
o'clock, was adopted. Professor Mc-
Naughton was requested to present any
evidence that he might have in his own
defense.
The principal changes In the faculty
are the election of Norris E. Daily of
Fresno, to the vice principalship and H.
M. Bland to the* English department,
and the dismissal of Miss < Cornelia Wal
ker and Mrs. A. B. Clement.

COUNTY CLERK
MUST FURTHER
REDUCE FORCE
Refused Rehearing by
Supreme Court.
â *- â
FIRST DECISION WILL STAND
â â¢ â
RELIEF WILL BE ASKED OF THE
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS.
â¢
They Have the Power to Grant an
Additional Appropriation,
Which Is All Tnat the
Office Needs.
Confident thai it? decision was in ac
cordance with the law. the Supreme Court
has refused to grant a rehearing in the
action recently decided, limiting the force
of. the County Clerk. It has been said
that this action on the part .... Su
preme Court has filled the office with dis
may, but this is in error, as County Clerk
Diane; in whose administration the mul
titudinous errors of past regimes have
vent th.-ir effect, has determined to work
within the law; but with what effect re
mains to be seen. It was thought that
on proper presentation for a rehearing
he Supreme Court would find points upon
which to reverse itself, but it has not.
and in consequence the box must again
twirl and the heads of many fall.
Aft.-r Mr. Deane had been apprised of
the action of. the Supreme Court upon the
application for a rehearing, he said: "Un
der the decision of the Supreme Court I
am allowed a force of thirty-two men.
Of this number nine are courtroom clerks
and they must, if possible, accomplish the
work heretofore requiring twelve men.
These men get $175 a month, as do nine
register clerks allowed me, with the ex
ception of three, who will be paid $150 a
month. Seven assistant register clerks
will be paid $!5u a month, one copyitiK
clerk $150 a month, two record clerks $150
a month and three copyists at 0 cents per
folio, whose earnings are not to exceed
$300 a. month. Just how the work is to
be performed under the decision I am
unable to tell. It takes ten copyists alone
to do the work of the two probate de
partments of the Superior Court; so nat
urally, with the reduced force, the public
must suffer.
"An incident, occurred yesterday which
is one of the best illustrations of the evils
which may result from a reduced force.
Mr. Monroe. ;m attorney, called at the
office and said that he desired to take an
appeal from an order of sale of real es
tate in a probate matter. He Informed
me that he could not perfect his appeal
until the judgment was regularly entered
ln the judgment book and recorder, and
that the same could not be done within
ten days; and that, therefore, his appeai
would be ineffective and would result in
great loss to the heirs whom he repre
sented.
"In order to oblige Mr. Monroe and in
order that the heirs might not suffer. I
placed a special man on he matte* and
had the judgment recorded at once so
that Mr. Monroe could take his appeal
within ten days allowed him by law. Now
[the proposition is that this being vaca
tion time and the work of the office slack,
we could do this favor, but suppose there
were several of the same kind of appeals
penchnp, it is plain that the result would
be disastrous. On these lines an effort
will be made to better the conditions by
effort to secure an increased appropria
tion, but whether or not we will be grant
ed the relief sought is another question."
Acting Chief Deputy Goddard was busy
during the day preparing figures and facts
upon which to make a proper showing be
fore the Supervisors next Friday. "Al
though the Supreme Court has affirmed
the decision heretofore rendered." said
Mr. Goddard. "we have another line upon
which to work. The decision of the court,
although limiting the number of officials
of the office who, under the statute, may
draw salaries, it does not say that we
must limit ourselves to that number. It
recognizes the necessity of a larger force
In the office, but sets forth that we must
find a way to pay them. This way rests
with the Supervisors. If the board will
frant us a further appropriation 'he Au
itor will act upon increased demands and
the Treasurer will honor them. This is
all we ask. We ask sufficient funds upon
which to conduct the office In a proper
manner, that the public will not suffer.
The matter brought about by the case in
the hands of Attorney Monroe is sufficient
to demonstrate the evils which may result
through a reduction of the force, and op
such cases we will work. Friday I will go
before the Supervisors and again present
facts and figures to sustain our applica
tion for an increased appropriation, and
I hope for success."

OPEN LETTER TO LEES.
Italians State Their Side of the Mafia
Story and Tell the Chief His Duty.
L'ltalla. the Italian morr..ng newspaper
of this city, publishes to-day an open let
ter to Chief Lees accusing the Police De
partment of holding up the Italian colony
In this city to unwarranted scorn and ridi
cult.
The recent attempted murder on San
Bruno road is taken as an instance of
this. The police are quoted in one of the
morning papers as having said that the
deed was lone by members of the Matia.
Regarding this L'ltalia says:
"If you (Chief Lees) know of the exist
ence of such a society, why do you not de
nounce it openly, arrest its chiefs, reveal
their abodes, their rules and so on? We
challenge you to do so, honorable Chief of
Police, because we know and are firmly
convinced that the Mafia exists solely in
the imagination of certain overzealous
agents who are simply abusing your good
faith. It is well nigh time that such ri
diculous statements as those regarding
the Mafia as well as the unjust vilifica
tion of Italian citizens should come to an
end."
The editorial also calls attention to the
fact that the percentage of criminals from
the Dalian colony is remarkably low and
points to the prison register to prove
this.

that most of the cases of that malady that
have developed hi re were discovered in

Entitle Any Pupil of a Public or Private School In San Francisco to Admission.
and they will he welcomed and treated
in a manner befitting the guests of a
great paper like The Call.
.if course they will all be there;
that's what the invitation is Issued for,
and who is going to refuse an invita
tion to see such a grand spectacle as
that which is being prepared for their
enjoyment? A special programme will
be put on, Including all the main feat
ures of the regular entertainment and
many additional features, in the first
place, the midget artists who have
been nightly winning praise by their
clever cakewalking will parade and
then go through their cakewalk.
Little Frankie Buttner, the 3-year
old wonder from Oakland, will walk
with Maragret Cronin. Blanche Tre
lease and Gladys Montague; Johnnie
Mangles and Cora Davis, Etta Aron
son and Harry Mangles, will walk, as

the children of the Flowery Kingdom
are famous and. accompanied by their
proud mammas and doting fathers,

ing was old and in a great number of
cases defective, and that it had never I.e.
done under the rules laid down by the
Board of Health.
Dr. Coffey moved that the Board of
Supervisors be notified if the condition
of affairs and requested to erect a suitable
building as a residence for the nurses.
The motion was seconded by Dr. Barbat,
and carried.
Dr. Coffey also moved that the present
quarantine be raised from all public in
stitutions, which was also carried. Dr.
Lawlor in his report said that no danger
remained of a smallpox epidemic and that
the few cases left had been gathered to
gether at the Twenty-sixth-street Hos
pital.
A petition from E. Hindi, a leper con
fined at the'Pesthouae, was read, in winch
he recites that his disease has ma no
progress during the last ten years and
that examinations of his blood have dem

disease remain. He asked permission to
leave the hospital and take steamer for
Asia. After considerable discussion his
request was granted with the proviso that
an attendant accompany him to the dock,
that there may be no mistake in his get
ting aboard the ship.
A letter from Auditor ".Veils was rend.

Dv Bell will give an exhibition on the
flying trapeze and there will probably
be a special match between Stewart,
the colored champion cakewalker, and
J. Walker Cole, the white champion.
The grand procession will open the
ball.
Last night another immense crowd
was present and went into raptures
over the many clever and laughable
features of the show. California Par
lor. N. S. G. W.. and Buena Vista
Parlor, N. D. G. "*.".*.. were present as
the guests of the management and oc
cupied a half dozen boxes specially re
served for them.
THE SAN BRUNO HOLD-UP.
Daniel^ Sullivan Arrested by Detec
tive Graham on Suspicion.
Captain James \V. Gillin of the Seven
teenth-street police station is leaving no
stone unturned in his determination to
bring to justice the men who figured in
the daring hold-up on the San Bruno road
ast Monday night. Early yesterday morn
n^ Captain om,n was at the station and
held a consultation with hi-*" two detec
tives-Graham and Fitzgerald. The hold
up and the motives which prompted the
Â« ?v. maske<l men were fully discussed :
Both the captain and his detectives
of the opinion that robbery was the prime
motive. Had the men wanted to shoo!
Ravegno they could have done so from
the doorway, as he was standing with hi*
back in that direction. Hence there would
have been â '"V" '7** for them to enter
the; store and order "all hands up.^as
In addition to Detectives Graham and
Fitzgerald, Officers McKenna and Shee
han were put on the case by Captain Gil
lin. McKenna lives within a block of the
house where the shooting occurred and
on the night of the trouble he entered
shortly after the highwaymen left the
store. In so doing he came near being i
subject for the Coroner, as th.- men who
had so tamely submitted to "hands up"
got their second wind after the affair was
over, and when McKenna entered there
were four pistols leveled at him
The detail from the Seventeenth-street
station scoured the entire San Bruno dis
trict and from certain Information re
ceived / Graham and Sheehan arrested
Daniel (alias "Pop") Sullivan at his home
on Twenty-seventh and Alabama streets
last night at 11:30 o'clock and brought
him to the Seventeenth-street station i
where he was locked up pending further
investigation. Sullivan is looked upon by
the police as a pretty hard case, and from
what was learned by the arresting officers
he knows more about the masked men
than he Is willing to tell. He is known
along the San Bruno road, where he has
been peddling for some time, and it is
thought that he may have heard of the
money transaction at th- store where the
shooting took place.

MUNICIPAL POLITICS.
â  _
Tis quite certain that during the whole hist' Ct
San Francisco, even including the stirring times
* which followed the Vigilance Committee of 1856,
there has never been a period when solid and con
servative Republicans, representing intelligence, in
dustry.and wealth honestly acquired, had the 0pp0r
...,,,.. for patriotic and effective service to their party
and to the community that is afforded by the ap
-..
prbaching municipal campaign.
This surely ought to be a Republican year. The
fusion Democracy, without principle or character, de
feated in 1898, and intimately allied through the Ex
aminer with the most corrupt elements in local poli
tics, has not even a party cry left rough which it
could successful appeal for popular support. In that
organization there is scarcely even a pretense of inde
pendence left. Mayor Phelan, who has been eulo
gized to the skies as a reformer, upon practical issues
l, as repeal len down. The apparent, perhaps
tlie simulated, controversy within the fusion ranks is
not between the machine on one side and intelligent
respectability on the other, but involves only the as
cendency of Lawrence and Rainey, or of the ancient
boss, Buckley, without any appreciable difference in
possible results.
On the other hand, yielding to public opinion and
to the demands of the Republican press, the Cen
tral Committee of the Republican party withdrew its
application for a blanket ticket, and a primary elec
tion is now to be held, based upon precinct repre
sentation within the legislative subdivisions of the
municipality. This plan corresponds to the spirit as
well as to the letter of the primary election law, and
fully meets with the popular demand. But the deeper
question, which no theory can evade, has still to be
met. Who are to be the candidates when the primary
is held? If the best Republicans shirk their duties
and their responsibilities, then the Republican
municipal convention will be a failure. If, on the
other hand, representative men, clear from all com
-1 licit] in corrupt monopoly politics, known for trTeir
conservative intelligence, for their independence and
for their integrity, are placed upon the primary
tickets, a successful convention is assured.
Bui even though, as The Call trusts and believes,
-â  . â¢ _- . .
the Republican municipal convention of this year
should '** the best recorded in our local history, that
alone will not be sufficient to .insure success at the
polls. The chiet element i" the practical reform now
rently in progress is that men to whom office
holding is distasteful and a. sacrifice must consent to
become candidates. No man ought to be nominated
for office to whom the emoluments are the inducing
charm. The laborer is worthy of his hire, but that
numerous class that has lived and fattened on poli
tic-, with no other visible means of support, has been
"- ; ' â ".' ,'â  ' â¢' ' 'tf' .' i â¢ â r" a '
the principal clement in the degradation of American
municipalities.
It is essential, therefore, that when a first-class con
vention ljas been selected no second-class candidate be
proposed, much le-s nominal Business men, who
have some regard for their own interests, which are
identical in many respects with the interests of the
public, must actually realize the necessity of recog
nizing civil obligation-". It is ten.a duty to accept
an othce even at serious personal inconvenience and
though it involves some diminution of income and
some pecuniary loss. It is possible for a local Re
publican ticket to be framed in San Francisco so per
fect from top to bottom as to be impregnable. That
â â â â <-â â â 
is the kind of a ticket that is demanded especially this
year, when the new charter i- about to take effect.
The Call expresses the sincere hope that the quality
. . . Â Â ' . . . ,
of the material before the municipal convention may
not be lowered by refusals of prominent and unassail
able Republicans to stand for office.
The remaining important point in the municipal
convention is the selection of a Central Committee to
which the management of the contest will be confided.
This selection is part of the ordinary business of a
municipal convention, but it is usually slighted. It is
precisely to this fact that the obtrusion of corruption
ist's, or mere boss or monopoly agents, is due, and,
even though in other respects the respectability and
the strength of a party has been vindicated, it is sunk
in popular estimation by the impurities and by the
weaknesses of its governing authority. Against this
tendency to failure it is now essential to throw out
invulnerable safeguards. Let there be absolute cor
respondence in the delegates to the convention, in the
nominees and in the Central Committee, as standing
upon the higher levels of Republican politics and
voicing the strong forces of the community, and suc
cess at the polls will be assured, and there will be a
clean and an efficient Republican administration of
the municipal government under the new charter.
The Call will endeavor to combine and to harmonize
the efforts of all good, citizens for the improvement
of local conditions and to drive bosses and corrup
tionists of every description, into the obscurity from
which they ought never to have emerged. The des
tiny of San Francisco is too great and her material
and commercial supremacy too close to justify the
further toleration of boss or of monopoly domination.
OUR OFFICIAL HAREM.
THE latest news from our oriental affliction is
that" Professor Schurman has visited the Sulu
archipelago, part of the Philippines, and has
called on the Mahometan Sultan who rules the same
to receive his submission to the star-spangled banner.
This Sultan rules about two millions of polygamous
Mahometans. The Koran permits them to have four
wives apiece, and, under certain circumstances, they
may have reinforcements and auxiliaries. As they are
far distant from the Sheik ul Islam, who oversees the
morals and manners of the Mahometan world, these
islanders may overlay the limit, both in wives and
side issues. The reports from them warrant the state
ment that they live up to their religion in both re
spects, and if holy zeal impel them to extremes of de
votion they face the future with no fear that an extra
tally or two will be laid up against them. Professor
Schurman called on the Sultan of these Stilus and
told him the United States desired to be known as the
sovereign of h^ country, and assured him that this
Government would protect his religion and the cus
toms which it permits and enjoins. Of course the
chief of them is polygamy. The potentate said that
he had no objection to becoming a Yankee, if there
was money in it, and his harem was let alone and his
people were permitted their usual plurality of wives.
Professor Schurman assured his Majesty that if any
thing gladdened the American heart it is to see a
Mahometan Sulu sitting under his oriental vine and
fig tree surrounded by his four authorized wives and
auxiliaries suited to his station in life. These assur
ances having passed, the professor agreed to pay the
Sultan $10,000 American gold and an annual subsidy
in the same coin for admitting that he belongs to this
republic, with all his wives and concubines.
The American pulpit has too generally, and not to
its credit, supported imperialism. It has justified the
dishonorable violation of the promise made by this
nation to the world when we warred on Spain by
saying that God ordered things and had made us
faithlessly lie to the world. It has dug up texts
and disgraced its profession by quieting the guilty
conscience of the country with the assurance that the
bloody slaughter of men and children and the murder
and deflowering of women in Luzon was done by
God's command to carry out his inscrutable purpose
of sending to those people the blessings of Christian
civilization! With such blasphemy it has pro
moted a violent adventure foreign to the purpose of
our Government, and in defiance of its fundamental
law.
The people now want to know a few things. If the
hand of God is 'in all this, which hand directs our offi
cial recognition of polygamy in the Sulus? Is God
on the side of the morality of the son of Mary or
the son of Abdallah? Is it Christ or Mahomet?
The pulpits of this country have rung with denunci
ations of Congressman-elect Roberts of Utah because,
according to the custom enjoined by his religion, he
has three wives and each has a litter of children. The
House of Representatives lias been ordered to refuse
him a seat. Our Declaration of Independence says
that we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all
men are created equal and endowed with certain in
alienable rights, among which are life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness. Lincoln made of this equality
a very vital issue. lie declared that if slavery were to
continue it must be made national and not sectional.
If a man south of Mason and Dixon's line were per
mitted to own slaves, the same right must be extended
to every man north of that line, or else slavery must
cease and the whole land be free and every man be
made equal in all his rights with every other man.
Slavery was in the South and polygamy was tolerated
by the National Government in Utah. With that
raised vision which is the gift of men inspired by prin
ciples, the founders of the Republican party in its first
platform denounced those "twin relics of barbarism,
slavery and polygamy." What man would have dared
foretell that the Republican party, consecrated by
Lincoln to equality of all men under the flag and
within the jurisdiction of the republic, and by its high
utterance to the extirpation of slavery and polygamy,
would ever compel the submission of subject races.
and without even the consent of Congress take the
money of the taxpayers to subsidize a polygamous
Sultan and get his harem under our flag by furnishing
the cash to restock it and promising to protect it in
the future!
. What better right has this insular stallion to a
harem than has Roberts of Utah? Roberts has not
asked the taxpayers to subsidize his seraglio, but
maintains it at his own expense. *
What has the imperialist: pulpit to say in the pre
mises?
The people arc going to have something to say, and
if matters go on the Republican party will be their
mouthpiece. When the old farmer goes home at the
close of his day's toil and' is met by his wife, made
plain by a life of labor, they think of their son gasp
ing in the Philippine hell and wonder why they arc
called to give him up and at the same time spare out
of their scant earnings money to gewgaw the women
of the harem of the Sultan of Sulu! They have been
content with each other. Their romance rises ""and
tints the shimmer of the twilight. They have earned
their bread in the sweat of their faces and believed
in God and their country. Let the pulpit make them
believe that the same God and Government is en
forcing eternal justice by sending an American to jail
in Utah for having two wives while indorsing poly
gamy in the Stilus and taxing them to subsidize it.
When the pulpit has 'done this it can prove that Christ
and Belial, God and Mammon, are one, and that truth
and lies are interchangeable.
THE USUAL THING.
REPORTS from Indianapolis concerning the
international convention of the Epworth
League, which is to begin its sessions to-day,
are to the effect that two delegations from California
arrived early on the ground one from San Francisco
and one from Los Angeles and it is added, "These
delegations represent two factions that are contending
for the meeting-place in iooi." _
It thus appears that in this contest the usual thing
is to happen. The delegates from each of the other
States will be united and will work together to obtain
the convention for some city of their State, but Cali
fornia will be divided, and one faction of her delega
tion will work against the other.
That sort of thing is so frequent the repetition of it
in this instance will cause no surprise. It is none the
less to be regretted that it occurs. The Epworth
Leaguers of the State ought to set an example of
harmony and co-operation rather than to follow the
old precedents of sectional divisions and factional an
tagonisms. If all the delegations from the State work
together the chances of bringing the convention to
California will be good, but if they remain divided it
is almost a foregone conclusion some other State will
bear away the prize.
Los Angeles has just entertained with success and
with credit to herself the National Educational Con
vention, and is therefore eager to undertake the en
tertainment of a greater convention still. That is
natural, and yet it is by no means well advised. The
TILE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JULY 20, 1899.
educational convention is estimated to have brought
to Los Angeles 15.000 people. She was able to take
care of that number well and comfortably, and to the
satisfaction of all; but it is said the Epworth League
committee expects to have -30,000 delegates and visit
ors at Indianapolis. Can a city of the size of Los
Angeles provide accommodations for such a gather
ing?
We have no desire to interfere in the internal poli
tics of the Epworth League, but the leaders and in
fluential members ought to see the folly of presenting
themselves at Indianapolis in contending factions in
stead of a united, harmonious body. The California
delegations should be brought together to settle
among themselves the choice of which city should
have the great convention, and then all should com
bine to make a winning contest for it.
THE PHILIPPINE SITUATION.
AFTER the pretensions of Spain to the Philip
pine archipelago had been purchased by the
United States, under the treaty of Paris, for
twenty million dollars, The Call frequently invited the
attention of the Government to the fact that, to se
cure the actual possession of the islands under the
transferred claim of divine right would require an
army of not less than one hundred thousand, and
probably of five hundred thousand, men. It also sug
gested that if the policy of permanently holding this
Asiatic acquisition, either as a colony or as a terri
torial appendage to the United States, should be
adopted, as our soldiers were mainly citizens and had
been educated and trained in the American concep
tion of liberty and independence, it would probably
become necessary to replace them by an army of mer
cenaries.
The cheap labor press, in which the Examiner is
I included, the imperialistic press, which embraces all
1 the agencies of American speculation and of British
pressure, and the humanitarian scrubs who smear
' hypocrisy with civilization, literally howled, roared
and frothed at the mouth over this essentially practU
cal view of the Philippine situation. The idea that the
experience of the decadent Roman republic could be
duplicated in the United States was derided as an in
sult to the Anglo-Saxon combination, through which
j freedom and imperialism were to be forcibly identified
| throughout the world. The Declaration of Indepen
| dence was satirized as a presumptuous assertion of
j principle, contradicted by universal fact. The consti
[ tution was described as a short under-garment,
through which the limbs of Columbia were unduly
exposed. The whole conception of an American re
public, limited in its territorial area to this continent
and spreading the seamless folds of organized human
sovereignty from sea to sea, was treated as a dyna
mitical explosion, of which even the echoes were dy
ing, as the blend of British imperialism and American
democracy spread their rainbow hues over the Asiatic
continent.
The verification of the anticipations of The Call has
been unexpectedly rapid. No one doubts now that it
will take at least a hundred thousand men to drill
American principles into the hides of the Filipinos.
They are an obstinate as well as a numerous people.
When we were disarranging the artistic perfection of
King George's wig they were confronting the im
maculate symmetry of Spanish chivalry. And now, in
1899, they absolutely refuse to acknowledge that they
are our purchased chattels, and in the face of our per
sistent effort to impress them with the necessity of
unconditional surrender to, our canonical boom of
American civilization thrust our own sentimental
declarations into our faces and ask whether our in
dependence was a joke or a reality.
The situation is really peculiar. If climate, soil,
race and all the other elements of Asiatic imperfec
tion are actually to be conquered and subjected for
cibly to our institutions, as temporarily interpreted,
an enormous increase of military force is imperative.
But, as The Call ventured to predict, the citizen sol
diery of our country have no stomach for a protracted
work of subjugation. They have performed wonders
of valor and of endurance. They have proved that
intelligent citizenship can overcome almost insur
mountable obstacles. But the work of assimilating
the Tagals, the Viscayas, the Negritos, the Malays
and the Mahometans, who constitute the mixed
population of our most recent colony, dependency,
territory, acquisition, or by whatever other name it
may be called, riles their good red American blood,
and they unquestionably prefer to be relieved and to
return to their prosaic occupation of developing
American civilization on the continent which has been
impressed with the signet of American liberty and in
dividuality.
Naturally the imperialists have turned to the Ameri
can troops of African descent. If they would only
cheerfully assume the task of subjugation the deadly
Roman parallel would be complete. But they dis
sent. They remember the Civil War, with all its an
tecedents. They have been filled with the magnificent
eloquence of Abraham Lincoln, of William H.
Seward, of Salmon P. Chase, of the great founders
and leaders of the Republican party. They have un
patriotically omitted to forget that by a proclamation,
constitutionally enforced, liberty and equality were
made a universal heritage within the bounds of this
republic. And, while they enjoy and flourish under
American institutions, thus developed to their logical
result, they object to disparage the theory they love
by practices they abhor. They are men and patriots,
and they will do their duty. But they would greatly
prefer to recognize in the Filipinos the same ties of
human brotherhood that have indissolubly united
them to their Caucasian fellow citizens.
To the ordinary human mind the Philippine* situa
tion is perplexing. The only possible solution has
been suggested by the Examiner, the organ of fusion
Democracy, the wholesale and retail dealer in "na
tional policies" and in detailed hysteria. Let Major
General Otis be replaced. If President McKinley
should inadvertently sec the editorial letter that has
been addressed to him and should act upon it, the
problem would be solved.
Meanwhile, however, the American people are
deeply interested in the question whether we live in
a republic or are on our way to empire.
The scandal at the Agnews Insane Asylum inclines
the official investigators to believe that there has
been a looseness of administration in the institution.
Perhaps an application of tar and feathers might make
some of the attendants more rigid.
Perhaps it will not concern ex-Secretary Alger
greatly that in resigning to fight trusts from the out
side he has added the offense of ingratitude to the rest.
It is not beyond precedent that Satan, being detected,
should rebuke sin.
It the esteemed Examiner would only wrap itself
in one of those army overcoats the stubborn boys
from Oregon will persist in not buying for themselves
it might meet the cold jeers of an unfeeling populace
with a great deal more comfort to itself.
The manner in which the Shamrock is putting it all
over the Britannia must be gratifying to the Irish.
MENDACITY OF
THE EXAMINER
IS DENOUNCED
Newspaper Greed Is Satisfied by Picturing the
Oregon Troops as Mendicants.
â â 
Army Officers Resent the Gratuitous Insult Given to the Soldiers
by a Yellow Journal Seeking to Gain Cheap Notoriety.
General Shatter Exposes an Indecent Scheme.
YOU can say as coming from me that clothing is only issued to
troops upon requisition made by either the colonel of the regi
ment or their company commanders; that there is no authority
except an act of Congress which would cover a gratuitous issue of
clothing.
There is a great quantity of clothing here in the city, ten
times as much clothing as could be used by a regiment. The colonel
was told by me the day that he arrived that all the clothing he
wanted was at his service; that he could put in his requisition
for such as he needed and it would be issued at once. He replied
that the men were disinclined to draw military clothing, which
they could not very well wear in civil life, and pay for it just as
they were going out of the service. The suggestion was then made
that they could draw underclothing, which could be worn just as
well after leaving the service as before.
A quartermaster is detailed at the Oregon camp who has large
quantities of clothing in his storehouse and he is ready to issue
it, but there has not been an article of clothing called for up to
to-day. The men in my opinion are perfectly comfortable.
I want to tell you another thing that has just come to my knowl
edge to-day. Yesterday the quartermaster of the Oregon regiment
went to the post quartermaster at the Presidio and requested to
turn into him some extra clothing that he had which he did not
want, but the Presidio quartermaster refused to receive it unless
ordered to do so. The Oregon regimental quartermaster then went
to Colonel Long, the depot quartermaster here, and wished him to
receipt for a lot of clothing that he had on hand and for which he
had no further use clothing that the Oregon troops had taken to
Manila and brought back here with them. One of the items in this
lot of clothing which the Oregon quartermaster wanted to turn in
was SEVEN HUNDRED OVERCOATS, besides a lot of blankets and other
clothing.
While the President has ordered me to see that these men are
supplied with all the clothing necessary for their comfort, he has
not ordered a gratuitous issue; and to make sure that the men were
properly supplied in accordance with the President's wish, and
that there was no neglect, the colonel of the Oregon regiment was
instructed to give the matter his attention in the following order :
Headquarters, Department of California,
% San Francisco, Cal. , July 37, 1899.
Colonel 0. Summers, Commanding Oregon Volunteer Camp: The de
partment commander directs that you make necessary requisition at
once for such clothing and supplies as may be needed to preserve
the health of your men. Please acknowledge receipt.
BABCOCK, Assistant Adjutant-General.
Government property is never loaned nor given away except in
exceptional cases, such as a yellow fever epidemic or a disastrous
flood, or some great calamity where many families are left desti
tute, and in such cases Congress afterward makes the necessary
appropriation to cover such extraordinary expenditures.
THERE are some things even the I
President of the United States may
not do, and one of these is to vio
late the law. It is written in army
regulations that no clothing shall be
issued to troops without being
charged up against each man's clothing
allowance, and the President can no more
j change this than he can suspend the right
of trial by jury. It is a law absolute and j
comprehensive and made to protect the j
I millions of dollars' worth of property han- j
j died by the military establishment, and j
1 not even the Examiner, capering solemnly .
i in its cap and bells and dimming the fires
! of the crematory with its tear-dampened |
I pages, can change it. It is perhaps be
i cause it knows it cannot change matters
! that the journalistic vacuum howls so
loud and characteristically and demands j
at columns' lengths the Presidential ear.
When the volunteers of Oregon came
here from the Philippines they were made j
welcome, and every one saw in them a j
body of men entitled to respect and fair
treatment, a regiment that had won honor
and was going home with its own glory.
It- remained with the Examiner, however, |
to find in them a medium for advertising i
Itself, and it has set about the task with
a will. It has placed the regiment in the
position of a lot of mendicants wasting j
away in the cold breezes of the Presidio,
while within reach of their hands but un- |
der lock and key are piles of overcoats j
! and blankets which the Government re- ]
j fuses to Issue. If the Examiner had any !
! intention of fairness it would have ac- j
j knowledged the position of the Govern- i
j ment and admitted that McKinley as well <
: as Itself knew something of the limits of i
! his office: that the men of the Oregon ;
I regiment were coatless because they \
j wished to save the price of the overcoat, j
not because the Government would not al- j
\ low them to draw one; and it might have ,
learned, too. that the men were quietly j
1 providing themselves with extra under- I
[ clothes, which would do them in civil life
â as well as in camp. But in this course
lay no opportunity for self advertisement, !
j and so the guests of the city, the men en
] titled by all rules of hospitality and senti
ment to the best treatment the press and j
j public can give them, were hustled into |
the Examiner's band wagon while the j
' Examiner gave tongue of its own worth. :
i General Summers was interviewed. Gen- j
eral Miles was interviewed, the President â 
' was interviewed, army officers here and in
Washington, heads of departments and i
; prominent citizens all were led into the j
: journalistic pen of the Examiner and were '
i quoted to show, not how cold were the j
! Oregon men even from an Examiner
standpoint but what a wonderful piece of !
paper and ink the Examiner was. The i
j Red Cross Society was appealed to in one i
j of those hysterical, inexpensive Examiner j
j appeals, and when the society was found
i to have been working on the same ques- i
1 tion rLsrht alone the Examiner Dromrjtly l
! put the ladies upon its staff and claimed
the glory of their work.
It will claim the glory won by any one,
if it can only get a person to read its
columns and believe what he has read,
It Would share with the volunteer the
only reward he has for his hardshipsâ the
I luster of his own courage, but It will win
no fame for Itself; It prefers rather that
I some one else finds the work and the
worry and wins renown, and then, like the
! old man of the sea, it will mount his
! shoulders and fill the air with its brays.
It would be all right if the regiment were
; out in a summer camp, having laid aside
! the arts of peace for a week or two, but
I in this case the victims are volunteers
j coming home to rest and security. They
| have braved the hardships of war and
: the ravages of disease; they should not
' now have to stand the self-seeking
| "friendship" of the Examiner. They
j have earned the gratitude of decent peo-
I pie; they should not be subjected to the
humiliating position the Examiner is will
ing to place them in to help in its wild
hunt for another subscriber. They need
a rest. It would be only charity to pay
j the Examiner what it hopes to gain by
I all its excitement and then tell it to keep
; quiet, for there are more volunteers com
ing.
In his statement to The Call, published
over his own signature, General Shatter
gives a clear outline of the position of
. the Government in the matter of clothes
! for its men. It is so plain it needs only
! to be read, and there can be no gainsay-
I ing it. The Government never could and
j never intended to issue clothing gratui-
I tously, and neither General Miles nor any
I one else ever said the Government would
do so. The clothing is there for the- men
jif they wish to draw it. If they do not
wish to do so, let the Examiner turn its
I wind batteries on something else and let
the volunteers alone.
The Red Cross Society has taken the
! question of clothing the volunteers into
! its own hands, and the first installment
!of overcoats purchased by the society
| was loaned to the Oregon Regiment yes
, terday. More will be- forthcoming to
day. The coats will be issued on the re
ceipt of the men and before they leave
; camp they will be expected to turn them
i back to be used by other incoming volun
teers.
The action of the Red Crops Society
was taken after it was seen that the Gov
ernment was powerless in the matter, and
its effect is not to provide the men with
anything the Government cannot or will
not furnish them, but to save them the
price of such articles, as it would be de
ducted from their pay if they drew the
clothing in the regular manner. Offi- '
cers and men are glad the matter has
been settled in this way. for they have
become tired of being placed in the light
of mendicants. As one officer expressed
it yesterday "the Government i... as
much power 'to issue twenty-dollar pieces
from the mint as to issue clothing gratu
itously," and this the regiment has un
derstood from the beginning. â :â  'â â â -â 
The overcoats furnished the troops last
evening were purchased from the regi
mental Quartermaster. Tuav have all
been stenciled with the name "Red
Cross," and they are the absolute prop
erty of the society. General Warfield
ha.- also renewed his offer of overcoats
and blankets to loan to the men. and it
is possible his kindness may be taken ad
vantage of. It is also announced that
there will be no objection from depart
ment headquarters if the men provide
themselves with civilian overcoats, al
though General Summers says he would
be sorry to see his men do so unless in
cases of necessity, as he fears it will
weaken the military spirit of the regi
ment. He has no objection to civilian
overcoats for trips down town, but he ob
jects to them on guard duty and parade.
Genera] Joseph Wheel and Lieutenant
Bolles, his aid, were the guests of Colonel
Freeman at the Presidio yesterday. They
were driven all over the reservation and
saw everything of Interest. The big guns
in the works beyond Fort Point were
handled for the general's benefit and
some "wind shots were fired from the
dynamite guns. General Wheeler had
luncheon with Colonel Freeman, at whose
quarters he met several of the officers of
the post. He was given a salute of eleven
guns, fired by the men of Eight Battery
C, Third Artillery.
General Wheeler was much impressed
with the strength of the harbor defenses
of this port and the amount of labor and
money expended in bringing them to their
present efficiency. He .expressed himself
as being highly pleased with the post and
everything he saw within it.
Lieutenant Colonel E. H. Plummer ar
rived here yesterday from Vancouver bar
racks to inspect applicants for commis
sions from the Oregon regiment who wish
to remain in the service. The regiment is
entitled to three commissions and the
lucky ones will be determined by Colonel
Plummer upon their examinations and
upon the recommendation they get from
General Summers, their commanding offi
cer.

GREAT INCREASE
IN SALMON TRADE
THE INDUSTRY AMONG THE
FIRST OF THE WORLD.
General Demand for the Canned Arti
cle as an Army Ration Since
the Recent Beef Scandal.
Ff-w people in the ordinary walks of
life have any idea of the enormous in
crease of the salmon canning industry
and the corresponding increase in the
consumption of this food by the people
of the world. Some idea of the industry
may be obtained from the following data:
lii IM*7 the pack of the world was 3,100,000
ca^fs- consumption. 2^00,000 cases; carried
over 600.000 "cases. In IS9B the pack of the
world was 2.300.900 cases; consumption,
2 COO.OOO cases, ln IS"? the estimated pack
of the world was 2.3d") .000 cases; estimated
shortage of the world. KW.OOO cases. The
increased consumption of the world in lb^S
ov-r tho season of 1*97 was 400.000 cases.
The tigurcs obtained from the shortage
this season as between the mated pack
and consumption do not allow for any in
creased consumption, the increase in con
sumption practically meaning a corre
sponding increase in the shortage.
Th<* big increase in th.' world's con
sumption of canned salmon in 398 was
partly due to the' fact that the American
and British Governments put salmon on
the ration list. The reports on salmon as
an article of army food have been so
satisfactory that this Government has
Just doubled the ration, or six times in
ten days where before it was three times
in ten days. Another thing which has
tended to increase the consumption of
canned salmon was the recent beef scan
dal. From the time this scandal became
public the beef trai has declined and
the salmon trade increased correspond
ingly. The average increase in the con
sumption of canned salmon during the
past five years lias been about 200,000 cases
annually.

The Nuptials of Miss /Mice Ames and
JKomas Robbir\s.
YESTERDAY at noon Miss Alice Ames became the bride of Thomas
Hinckley Bobbins of Boston in the presence of a large and fashionable
company at Grace Church.
The wedding was from a social standpoint quite the most prominent
of anycelebrated here for a long time, and the unusual artistic arrange
ments and the rare beauty of the bride and her attendants .made it a
picture never to be forgotten. Promptly at noon, the hour set tor the wed
ding the strains of the wedding march announced the arrival of the bridal
party First came the ushers, walking two by two in the following order:
Worthington Ames and Walter Martin. Bryant Grimwood and Benjamin
Robert Peabody Bellows and Stephen Hasket Derby, Roger Wolcott
and John Hart Polhemus. *â,iââ.âj n-tJi*
The bridesmaids, presenting a beautiful color Picture followed. First
came Miss .'or., Smedberg and Miss Louise Crosby, then Miss Lillian Shoo
bert and Miss Marie Wilson, Miss Norm:. Preston and Miss Mary Polhemus
Miss Edith McÃean and Miss Carrie Little. The bridesmaids were all dressed
differently and wore tulle hats to match their respective costumes. Miss
Smedberg was attired in white and Miss Crosby in lavender and white. Both
Miss Shoobert and Miss Wilson were In pink. Miss Preston was attired in
pink and Miss Polhemus in blue. Miss McÃean wore white and Miss Little

a green tulle hat to match. ' -'tf*"tfÂ»,-
The bride looked stately and handsome in her rich white satin gown. A

pleted the costume. â -. â¢ -
When the bridal party reached the chancel rail, where the groom and the
best man, his twin brother, William B. Bobbins, were awaiting, Rev. Dr.
Foute advanced to meet them, and. according to the solemn Episcopal ser
vice, pronounced them man and wife. After the ceremony there was a bridal
breakfast at the Ames home on Taylor street, after which the happy, young
couple left for a bridal tour, keeping their destination unknown. After a
short stay in the interior Mr. and Mrs. Bobbins will return for a few days and
then leave for the East and sail on August 2."> for Paris, where they will
make their home for the next four years. During their stay In the gay
capital Mr. Bobbins will study medicine and Mrs. Bobbins will .-give her at
tention to music. Mg,aal
Local society in losing Mrs. Bobbins loses one of the most popular of its
belles. Handsome, charming and extremely talented, the fair bride has al
ways been greatly sought after and has entertained delightfully at the home
of her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Pelham Ames, on Taylrfr street. Aside from her
many social qualities Mrs. Bobbins is an accomplished musician, her talent
being far above that of many professionals. The happy groom Is the son of
Chandler Bobbins, the eminent preacher of Boston.
THE SAIN - FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JULY 20, 1899.
puffs away with all the evident joy of
a veteran. The first thing in the morn
ing on awakening Paul cries for his
cigar and his cheroot brings him com
fort just before he drops off to sleep.
In between times be takes a whiff at
his pipe, though the little man declares
he prefers the cigar and only smokes
his pipe "when papa does." Paul's
pernicious habit does not seem in any
way to have Injured his health. He
is unusually large and robust for a
little fellow of his age, active and in
telligent. In other ways he is much
like other children, with the only ex
ception that he is not fond of sweets
of any kind. He talks fluently, abbre
viating many of his words ii} helpful
baby fashion and transposes sentences
to meet his demands. His cigar he
tenderly refers to as "gar," and his
corncob is a "smoke pipe." With will
ing graciousness Paul smoked to con
vince his visitors that really Visalia
has something besides its saddles to be
proud of. The cigar he held daintily
between his first and second fingers,
and, after puffing away for several
moments, declared he had had "a nice
smoke."
Little Paul is the adopted child .of
Point Lobos Improvement Club.
The Point Lobos Improvement Club
elected the following officers at a meeting
held ! .<-' evening: President, George R.
Fletcher; first vice president, Edward
Mr. and Mrs. L. E. McCabe of Visalia.
He was born at Los Angeles, and at
the age of two months was deserted by
his mother. He was three months old
when the McCabes got him. and, ac
cording to Mrs. McCabe, at once
showed a preference for tobacco.
"When he was three months old," said
Mrs. McCabe, "I noticed he enjoyed
the smell of tobacco smoke, and when
his father would take him in his arms
while he was smoking the baby would
at once grab for his cigar. At the age
of one year he began to smoke and
soon developed an inordinate taste, for
tobacco. Since then he has smoked
right along, either cigar or pipe. When
he does not get his cigar he cries and
will not be quieted until he has had
his tobacco. "He smokes the first thing
in the morning and the last thing at
night."
After her adopted child showed
signs of the tobacco habit Mrs. Mc-
Cabe made Inquiries as to his parents
and discovered that the little one's
father was an inveterate smoker. "So
I have concluded," said Mrs. McCabe,
"that the love of tobacco with Paul
is an inherited taste and I consider it
useless to try and curb his appetite
for it."

LOCAL NORMAL SCHOOL
OPENS NEXT MONTH
POLITICS WILL NOT CONTROL
FACULTY APPOINTMENTS.
Graduates of Accredited Schools Will
Be Admitted Without Examina
tion, but Other Applicants
Must Stand the Test.
The San Francisco State Normal School,
located on Powell, near Sacramento street,
will open for the reception of students on
August 14. Graduates from schools ac
credited by the University of California
will be admitted without examination. All
other applicants must pass a satisfactory
examination in the subjects provided for
in the register of the State University.
Frederic .Burk, principal of the school,
will be in his office from 10:30 to 12 m.
every day excepting 1 Sundays arid Mon
days to receive applicants. The examina
tions will commence on August 8.
The selection of the faculty of the new '
Normal School rests entirely with the
principal and, according to him, political
influences will have no effect on the ap
pointments made.
In some ways the school will be an inno
vation in the Normal School system fol
lowed in the State. There will be, for in
stance, a training school, accommodating
100 pupils, who will be required to pay
about two dollars a month for their tui- j
tion. This training school will be taught :
directly by the faculty, but the student
body preparing for positions as teachers
will accompany the faculty through the '
classes and observe the methods used to \
teach the young idea how to shoot gram
matically.
The course will be a strictly professional
one in every branch of pedagogy, and j
graduates will receive diplomas entitling
them to teach in any grammar school in j
the State. â¢
The Board of Trustees of the school con- :
sists of the following members: Judge S. >
C. Denson, president; H. G. W. Dinkle- i
spiel. F. A. Hyde, M. Conney, W. G. Job- j
son, T. J. Kirk and Governor Gage. The j
trustees will meet July 31 to confirm the i
selection of the faculty of the school pro- j
posed by the principal.

RELATIVES TO MEET.
They Will Make Arrangements to
f Welcome the First California
at the Presidio.
To-morrow night there will be a meeting
in the hall of the Armory of the Nationals
at SI.", Ellis street of the relatives of the
members of the First California Begi- j
merit, which will soon be here from Ma
nila. This organization, which was
j started some time ago, when there was
the first talk of the volunteers returning,
represents about two thousand relatives ;
' of the boys who have been in the trenches, I
and' the purpose of the meeting is to make !
arrangements to give them a welcome at j
the Presidio on the day that they shall
land. f tftf. r.
A number of plans will be presented and
the most feasible one will no doubt be
adopted. The executive committee has j
1 waited on General Shafter and he stated !
i that he would give the members of the
j association an opportunity to go to the ;
' Presidio the same day that the men reach j
there so that all may have an opportunity
to see those who have been so long ab- !
I sent from them. ' r.

BED AND BOARD AT
THE CITY'S EXPENSE
SHREWD SCHEME OF JOSHUA
HINCKLEY.
Complained of Sore Feet to the Re-.
ceiving Hospital Attaches Until 1
Arrested for Vagrancy.
Joshua Hinckley, a man 60 years of age,
who is known as "the professional sick
man," appeared before Judge Mogan yes- |
terday on a charge of vagrancy. He was ;
arrested Tuesday night on the complaint |
of Steward Hess of the Receiving Hos- .
pital. Â ,i .
Some months ago Hinckley called at |
the hospital, complaining that he was |
troubled with sore feet. He was assigned
to a cot in the male ward and for two !
days he remained in the cot, getting well j
fed during that time. He called several
times later, and finally was told that if
he did not stop coming he would be ar
rested for vagrancy.
This threat had the effect of keeping
him away till the new administration took \
office arid he again called with the plea
of sore feet, getting a bed and his coffee i
and rolls in the morning. He became so ,
bold that he would sneak into the hos- ;
pital at nights and take possession of a
cot till he was told that his arrest would
follow if he did not keep away. He :
sneaked in Tuesday night and Hess sent
for a policeman and had him locked up ;
in the City Prison.
He told the Judge that he owned prop- i
ertv in Austin County. Nevada, and in
Maine, but his agent was in Europe, and
till he returned he could not obtain any ;
funds. He recognized ex-Judge Joachim
sen in court, saying that he had known -
him in Austin County forty years ago. .
He expressed his desire to go to friends
in Oakland, but had no money. The
Judge gave him 50 cents on his promise
that he would remain in Oakland with .
his wife and friends.
MILITARY HABEAS CORPUS.
Young Richard Windrow Joined the
Army to Go to the Philippines.
Bert Schlesinger applied to United
States District Judge de Haven yesterday
for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf
of Jennie M. de Succa, guardian of Rich
ard Windrow, alleged to be a minor and
to be unlawfully detained of his liberty by
Major P.. H. Bnnkerhoff of the Thirty
fifth United States Volunteers. The peti
tioner alleges that Windrow was born
on August 12. 1878, and that on July 17
of this year he enlisted without her per
mission in the Thirty-fifth.
Windrow's father belonged to the fire
department of this city and was killed
while performing his duty at a fire on
Page street seven or eight years ago.
A fund of several thousand dollars
was raised for the support of the j
two children. Mrs. de Succa fears that
if young Windrow should leave the State
she might be held responsible on her
bonds.
WELLS SUES HIS MOTHER.
Claims She Sent for Him and Then
Threw Him Out.
Arthur L. Weils filed suit against his
mother, Olive M. Washburn, yesterday to
recover $5000 damages for breach of agree
ment. Wells alleges that in July of 1897
his mother, who is worth $200,000, pre
vailed upon him to sell out his business
in Wilmar, Minn., and come to this city
to manage her business interests. When
he arrived with his family, he says, she
took him with her home for a short time
and then ejected him. He has since been
unable to find employment sufficient to
properly support his family, he sets forth,
and sues to recover the sum named.

Call.
NEW YORK, July 10.â The Sporting
Life of London says: Jim Jeffries and
Charley Mitchell are really matched,
but the terms indicate that the Eng
lishman has no faith in his ability to
make a ii^-ht against the champion.
In regard to the match, the decision
was quickly reached. Mitchell, first of
all, stated his terms. Brady then out
lined what conditions would be accept
able to Jeffries. Finally a match was
ratified for the boxing champions of
England and America to contest 10 two
minute rounds, with five- Â» gloves,
on a day to be named during the last
week in August, at a place to be mu
tually agreed upon. The chief bone of
(â¢.intention proved to be the appoint
ment of a referee. Mr. Brady sug
gested several gentlemen for this of
fice, and finally named two well-known
sportsmen to whom Mitchell said he
could offer no objection. This practi
cally settled the business. Articles
were at once drafted and signed, of
which the following is a copy*.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
COWES, July 19.â There was beautiful
weather to-day for the trial of the yacht
Shamrock, challenger for the America's
cup, against the Britannia. There were
big crowds both ashore and afloat to wit
ness the race. The course to-day was
yesterday's course reversed. The start
ing point was -iff the Royal Yacht Squad
ron's house, around the Solent bank buoy,
thence to the Nab lightship, finish!] - at
the spit buoy off Portsmouth.
The Prince of Wales boarded the Brit
annia shortly before the start. There was
a good southeasterly breeze blowing all
the morning, but it softened considerably
toward the time for the starting of the
race. Both yachts carried club topsails.
A good start was effected at '10:12 a. m.,
the Shamrock crossing the line a half
length ahead of her competitor, being
very smartly handled. She "had a new
spinnaker set for the run to the Solent
bank. Her sails seemed to set better than
yesterday. The breeze almost died out
as the yachts stood along shore and the
boats housed their spinnakers. The boats
then headed for the center of the channel
to avoid being becalmed on the lee of the
island. Th Britannia followed Then was
but little air, and the yachts practically
drifted during the next half hour. The
breeze then revived and the Shamrock,
which meanwhile had slightly increased
her lead, secured a start, widening he
gap that rated her from the Brit
annia, and rounded the Solent bank buoy
at 11:17:20. The Britannia rounded the
buoy at 11 .-21:35.
The I oats returned close-hauled up the
port tack. There was only the faintest
breeze and the Britannia was '-getting the
better of it. slightly reducing the gap.
Nearing (Towe's, however, the breeze
freshened considerably and the beat to
the Nab lightship promised to show better
time.
The Shamrock passed Ryde, going to
ward the Nab lightship; a mile and a half
ahead of the Britannia, and finally won
easily--
PORTSMOUTH. July If.â The yacht
Shamrock grounded off South Sea. be
tween Portsmouth harbor and Langston
harbor, but was soon towed off. It does
not appear likely that the challenger suf
fered material damage.
As was the case yesterday, the Sham
rock shot her superiority very soon
after the start was made. Beating to
windward, she ran away from her oppo
nent to the Nab lightship anil went
about in ten seconds, the Britannia occu
pying twelve seconds. The whole per
formance again showed that the chal
lenger is far ahead of the Britannia, al
though ihe unfortunate becalming of the
boats precluded he finishing of the course
before the Prince of Wales was obliged to
start for London. The Shamrock was ap
parently not damaged by the grounding.
The course as originally planned was not
completed. When off South Sea the
Britannia signaled that the Prince of
Wales had an engagement in London, and
requested that the race be considered
over, as he must return to Portsmouth,
The Shamrock was then twelve or fifteen
minutes ahead. She was immediately
turned homeward and directly afterward
grounded on a bank off Horse's Foot Fort.
She remained fast for ten minutes, when
she was safely and easily towed off and
back to Southampton.

LOTTIE M, HENRY LYNCH'S BLACK WONDER.
rhotograph by BOTE & HABENICHT.
The eyes of the leashmen have been upon Henry Lynch's wonderful little greyhound Lottie M for some time past. This
dainty maiden of the coursing field was whelped June I. 1897. On April 21 of the following year, when she was 10 months old,
she~woi a sapling stake. On May 21 she repeated the performance. On June 1 she won again, meeting IS-months-old dogs.
bn~j"une'l2 she was second in a sapling stake, her sister, Lalla Rookh. defeating her in the final. June 26 she won a sapling
stake, and on August 21 captured a beaten dog stake* She ran ten courses to win, three being "no goes." Although still a
puppy until December, she won an open stake November 6. â.-â. . . â, â
She won her first stake this year on May 7. and repeated the performance June 21. She was runner-up to the mighty Glad
iator June 25 and won the open" stake July 9. Her winnings total $1138, and some of the first prizes were small ones. She has
always been 'trained and handled for Mr. Lynch by John Maher. To the latter' rare judgment in conditioning the dog is
considered the secret of her success by her owner. She was bred by John Kerrigan. She never misses an opportunity to
â¢-core and always runs faster the farther she goes. In condition she weighs forty-seven pounds.
cessâ entirely appropriate. So far
as It went the race was a splendid exhibi
tion of drivers' skill, combined with fast
young horse flesh. Kingmond, the strong
favorite of the day, encouraged his back
era by getting a heat. Then the . exciting
tlnish began. M- Henry, in a wonderful
drive in the stretch, pushed Success Into
winning In an almost dead heal finish with
Kingmond. ("cers did likewise with th"
Queen in the third heat. He tried it again
in the fourth, but The Queen failed to
carry out her noted driver's plans.
Wilask gave Kingmond a close race In
the first heat, Kingmond leading almost
all the way by only a neck. In the second
heat Kingmond. Wilask and The Queen
were together to the head of the stretch,
when Success got into the game and won
the heat from Kingmond by the barest of
noses. In the third heat Success and
Kingmond approached the final turn neck
and neck, but Geera came out with The
Queen and justified his reputation by the
manner in which he took the heat away
from the favorite. The bunch came
strongly toward the end of the fourth
heat The Queen and Kingmond were
leading when The Queen broke, while
Royal Baron came to the front and got
his nose first beneath the wire.
Lady of the Manor was played as the
favorite ln the 2:07 pace, but failed to'
satisfy her backers. The low mark of the
day (2:06%) was reached by Pearl Onward
in this event.
Sphinx S, the favorite, got only the
place ln the 2:27 pace, and Dorothy S, a

Payne of San Francisco Criticized
for Being Too Liberal in the
Bestowal of Blue
Ribbons.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA BARBARA. July 19.â Santa
Barbara Kennel Club has demonstrated
the- truth of the old adage that "faint
heart never won fair lady." Having the
midsummer heat to contend with, the
young club has nevertheless scored a sig^
nal success In Its second annual dog
show.
The fudges are Francis T. Underbill of
New York for mastiffs, C. A. Sumner ot
Los Angeles for fox terriers and 11. T.
Payne of San Francisco for all other
breeds.
Mr. Underbill's task was a peculiarly
easy one. The mastiffs were represented
by hut one specimen, and that one so good
that his blue ribbon was well merited.
: Alden M. Boyd of Los Olivos showed thld
: noble animalâ Bismarck, by Royal-Mona.
! With a somewhat shorter muzzle Bis
marck would win from any mastiff shown
i in this State in the last 'tfwo years.
Mr. Payne In the open Great Dane class
(dogs) gave first to Riband II and second
to Viking, though many fanciers thought
i the latter beat the former in head and
legs and was just as good in body. Star,
â < rather weedy specimen, had as much
as he merited with the third prize. In
the open class for bitches, Marjel 11, a
typical Dane, was atone, as was Cham
pion Juanita, in the champion class.
Of the St. Bernard rough coated puppy
: dogs. King Kamehaha, a well marked dog
of good head and type, took first. He
was practically alone, as his would-be
competitor. Prince,, was a black and white
mongrel. In fougd coated bitches. Queen
Regent took first. In novice dogs, Duke
D, a fair specimen, was alone, as was
Orangedale Bute in novice bitches. Or
angedale Bute Is very good In head and
body, but her markings show too much
white. She took third in open bitches.
| In rough coated dogs, Omar Khayyam,
good In head, body and markings, took
first; Barry of Glen Rosa second, al
though Duke D is better in expression,
limbs and head, but the decision should
i not be impeached, as Barry is far the
better mover. In open bitches. Lady Bute
H took first easily. She Is active, good
all over and her expression is typical.
Lorelei II Is almost as good, but Is sway
backed; while Orangedale Bute was
beaten for the second place by her color.
In winners of bitches, Princess Scheher
azade was alone. A red ribbon should
have been given her, but Mr. Payne as
usual was far too liberal with the blue.
Princess is good in body, but lamentably
weak in head. In champion dogs, King
Munlek, a moderately good specimen, was
alone in his class.
puppies were shown, contrary to the rules.
Both were beauties and were awarded the
blue ribbon. Grouse F was alone in nov
ice dogs and competed with Sport W in
the open. Grouse was ludicrously fat, but
was so much better than Sport that he
was rightly awarded the blue ln spite of
his poor condition. Stamboleta. a splen
did bitch, was alone in the open and
champion Qeen of Counts lacked compe
tition in her class.
In bull terriers Daisy was the only bitch.
She has a thick head and was another
Instance of Payne's poor judgment in
awarding a first. In dogs Teddy Roose
velt, a little too fat but very good in head
and body, was an easy winner. Second
was withheld and third was given to
Dewey, a cross between a bull dog and a
bull terrier. \-~- "
Roly Poly, a halfbreed, shown as a
Spitz, obtained a second prize, being alone
In her class. Japie, a perfect specimen of
the Japanese spaniel, beat Fugl Sam, a
good little dog. Waldlne was alone In
Dachshund bitches, as was Rex M in
dogs. Each obtained a blue and was a
good type of the class. Fanny, shown as
a bobtailed sheep dog-, was simply a half
breed collie with a docked tail and was
properly sent out of the ring.
Judging will be resumed to-morrow and
i^obaWy will be coached, |-

Incipient Riot, Incited by
the Rough Tactics of
Jack Ennis.
The solar plexus punch which Boxer
Fitzsimmons used in his memorable battle
at Carson City and the fame of which
traveled around the world was used with
telling effect at the San Francisco Ath
letic Club last night. It. was delivered in
the fifth round of the bout between Ed
Foy and Joe Bell, the latter being on the
receiving end of the battery. Ho had
returned blow for blow with his adversary
until Toy suddenly assumed the aggres
sive and hustled him all over the ring.
Bell's defense was gone and he was at
the mercy of Toy, who fairly rained
blow after blow on face and body. Ser
geant of Police Coogan was about to en
ter the ring to stop the boxing when Toy
landed a short-arm jolt in the pit of
Bell's stomach. Bell dropped to the floor
and rolled over on his back in agony
just as the gong signaled the end of the
round. There was no chance of his being
ready at the end of the minute rest, so
the decision went to Toy. The victory
was not a popular one, .as the spectators
thought Toy resorted to unfair tactics.
The bout between Vickers and Ennls de
veloped an incipient riot. Sergeant Coo

the sixth round, as the principals and sec
onds seemed intent upon making a battle
royal. The boxers had all the lion in them
aroused and for four rounds had* stood up
manfully and exchanged punch for punch.
In the sixth round Ennls was fighting
furiously when the bell sounded. He kept
right on, although Referee Greggains tried
to stop him. The seconds for both men
were a swaying, struggling mass about
the boxers when "the police took a hand.
They cleared the ring and the referee de
clared it "no contest." saying the men
were there to box and not act like bull
dogs.
The majority of the bouts were good,
the spectators getting full worth for their
money. Charley Thurston and Henry
Lewis, Deacon Jones and Joe Dodson
fought draws. Mike McClure received the
decision over Dan Ryan.
MILE RECORD LOWERED.
WASHINGTON.* July 19.-Harry Elkes
of Glens Falls, N. V., the middle-distance
champion bicycle rider of America, to-day
covered a mile In 1:31 flat, thus lowering
the record for that distance, held by
Eddie McDuffie of Boston, of 1:31 2-5. He
was paced by a motor cycle quad operated
by Henri Fournler. Elkes followed the
cycle closely from start to finish, the dis
tance between the two at no time being
more than a foot. There was no wind
shade to lessen the resistance. After the
first ride Elkes rode another mile under
the same conditions in the same time.

The umpire question is agitating the
league at present. At Watsonville last
Saturday and Sunday a change of umpires
was found necessary to satisfy the pa
trons in that town. The last time San
Francisco and Watsonville met in this
city the Farmers swore by scores of holy
books that Cahill was not fair or just in
his decisions. According to schedule,
Cahill went to Watsonville last Saturday
and umpired the game, after which a
storm broke loose that rocked the town.
T. F. Bonnet, who managed the local
team, saw thai the public ill-feeling must
be quieted, though he believed Cahill's
decisions to be absolutely fair in every
respect. He went to Santa I'ruz that
night and persuaded the Santa Cruz team 1
to accept a change of umpires, so Levy
and Cahill interchanged. As soon as j
Santa Cruz had agreed to this they re- I
pented, and rumors began to circulate
that the Lobsters were to be grilled.
Luckily the games were not decided on
the umpire's ruling.
A high old time is in store for the rout'
ers at Sacramento when the Lobsters and
the Senators cross bats Saturday. The
Lobsters are kicking their many legs be
cause the games are not to be played on
home grounds. Early in the season they
agreed to play a series with the Senators I
at Sacramento if the latter team would
compromise by visiting the Lobsters on
July 22 and 23. The Senators will get
both the pudding and the sauce, for the j
games will be played at Sacramento.
Question after question has been asked j
Bonnet why the local team received such
a drubbing from Watsonville.
"it's just this way. said Bonnet.
"Every man in these country towns
makes a coach of himself and how the
visiting teams stand It as well as they do
is a mystery to me. These country enthu
siasts set up a wild-fire josh that Is rat
tling in- the extreme. Why, they hardly
let a man play. If you think this does not
count in a match you are mistaken. When
an umpire gives a decision thai strikes
the home consciousness of opposition a
wild noise orgy is in working order at
once. You ought to see one of those games
to appreciate it."'
Streib is fast overhauling Krug as the
premier hitter of the league.
San Jos.- has signed two new players
this week. Jack Huston, who lias played
on almost every diamond in the country,
will play short and Dick O'Meara, who
played the outfield for Fort Wayne in the
Interstate League of 1896, will play right.
Huston is well known as a pitcher of
more than ordinary ability, having tilled
that position in the Sacramento club,
California League, In 1891, in the Pacific
Coast Northwest League and Texas and
Southern leagues. Of late years he has
played infield, this season coming third,
and managing the Mobile team in the
1 Southern League. He will prove a valua-
I ble acquisition to San Jose, being a splen
did base runner, a good fielder and fine
hitter. BBTtB
Of O'Meara not much Is known save
that he had a batting average in the In
terstate League of 1597 of .347 and was
considered a fair fielder. BwPI
The introduction of this new element In
the San Jose club will mark the retire
ment of Leake and Graham from, the pro
fesslqhal ranks for the balance of the sea
son. These players signed contracts to
play with San Jose until the close of the
vacation, as they will take up their
duties at college, Graham as professor
and Leake as a student. This necessitates
their retirement from professional ball
! playing. qB r *BMMH
O'Connor is looked upon as a valuable
find for the Sacramento club. He is no
doubt a good hitter and understands all
the points of the game thoroughly. 11.
will fill the position of captain for his
club.
Swindell will be behind the bat for the
locals this week, his spilt hand received
in the game a week ago Sunday having
healed. His Injury weakened the local
team in the last series, necessitating a
general change of positions.
Watsonville is looking for talent and
the wires are kept hot with offers to
Eastern players of ability.
Steffanl has proved a valuable find for
the Oakland team. His work against
Sacramento was decidedly brilliant.
From the manner in which Daubendais
is pitching, It looks as if Santa Cruz does
not require an Eastern pitcher.
San Francisco and San Jose will play
an exhibition game by electric light on
Thursday, July 27, at San Jose. This will
prove a decided novelty In the California
Baseball League, although it has been
undertaken with decided success by East
ern leagues. There will also be exhibi
tions of base running, throwing and hit
ting by the players, for which the win
ners will receive cash prizes.
Policemen's Heavy-Weight Race.
Captain James W. Gillln's company, the
pride of the Police Department, is all ex
citement over a foot race which is about
t>o come off between Officers J. T. Edner
and Edward Nolan. Both men are now in
training, while Prison-keeper Frank
O'Brien jingles $100 in his pocket, the re
sult of a bet made by the two men, who
will try each other's speed on the old base
ball grounds at Sixteenth and Folsom
streets within the next two weeks
The bet and the race grew out of an In
cident which occurred last Monday nigh*
when Sergeant Blank detailed four offi
cers to round up a gang of hoodlums who
were annoying the residents of Bryant
and Nineteenth streets. Edner and Nolan
were among those sent out to do the
catching act. While giving chase to the
fleetfooted toughs Edner caught two
while Nolan only bagged one. Over thesÂ«
captures came the challenge as to which
was the best runner. There was only
one way of deciding the speed and this
was to run a race at 100 yards. The match
was made and in order to bind it -tleht
each man deposited $50 with O'Brien and
Officer Charles Barnes was selected as the
referee. " c
The comical side of the race and the
bets Is that both men belong to the heavy
weight squad. Edner weighs 200 pounds,
while Nolan turns the beam at 195 pounds
Both men are now in active training tak
ing their spins when off duty and walk
ing their beats with such a rapid move
ment as to excite the curiosity of the Mis
sion residents, who have been accustomed
to see the "cops" walk at the rate of a
mile an hour.

Expected.
The meeting of Boxers Green and Goff
in the arena of the National Athletic
Club, Woodward's PaviliQn. to-night, is
expected to prove a short and merry one.
The betting men have figured it out that
Green should win on public form and are
placing their money accordingly. Green is
favorite at 10 to 7. The short end is in
demand at these figures, as Goff is con
sidered a likely man by those who saw
him perform with Franey recently.
Referee Hiram B. Cook may "not be
called upon to name the victor on points,
as the bout is not expected to go the limit."
Both men have trained for a bustling fight
and in the exchange either man may go
out quickly. * -,w,

LAW OF THE TENANT
AND THE LANDLORD
The Case Involves a Big City Lot of
the Heydenfeldt Estate Leased
to a Lumber Company.
Supreme Court Commissioner Haynes
yesterday rendered an interesting deci
sion, which was approved by the court, in
the â¢us-* of Charles Ashton, trustee,
gainst the Golden Gate Lumber Com
pany of this city, which has been be
fore the court for over two years. In i***-7
Judge Solomon Heydenfeldt, now de
ceased, executed to Ashton a deed in trust
for a 50-vara lot on North Point and
Beach streets, with full power to lease,
collect rents, etc. One condition was that
in the event of the death of Heydenfeldt's
son, who was to receive the benefits of
-the property, with or without issue, the
trust should end and the property be con
veyed to the Judge, and in the event of
his death, to his heirs. Judge Heyden
THE H. D. BENDIXSEN IN A CALM.
The new schooner H. D. Bendlxsen is now out thirty-six days from Honolulu
and should reach port at any hour now. All the vessels of the sugar fleet have
been making long passages and the chances are that the Bendlxsen has been
delayed by light winds and culms.
Vessels that left the islands a long time after the schooner are beginning
to arrive, and their captains report good sailing weather, so the Bendlxsen should
follow them Into port. The bark S. C. Allen came up in seventeen days and the
barkentine S. N. Castle ln twenty-one days. The barkentine Wrestler is, how
ever, out twenty-seven days from Kahulul.
hit died in 1890 and the son in 1594. In
the meantime Ashton had leased the lot
to the lumber company named for a term
of fifteen years for a consideration of
$21,300, payable monthly, at from $100 to
$150 per month, as the years passed.
As ton was bilged to sue for the rent
ln 1595. The lumber company resisted his
demands on the ground that Ashton's
Stewardship as trustee expired upon the
death of Heydenfeldt Jr., and that there
fore he had no right to collect the rent,
nor was the company under obligation to
pay him the same. In the lower court
judgment went to the defendant com
pany, but this decision was upset by the
Supreme Court, which reversed the same
with directions to the court below to en
ter judgment for Ashton.

LEOPOLD HERINGHI SUED
BY HIS BROTHER EDWARD
Complaint Alleges That Plaintiff
Paid for Four Lots for Which the
Pawnbroker Holds Deeds.
The differences between Leo Heringhi j
and the other members of his family j
which were first made public about a I
month ago have by no means been settled. j
According to the brothers of the Stockton- 1
street pawnbroker Leo has not only failed I
to live up to ids contract wirh his mother,
who mortgaged her home in order to start
him in business, but has also betrayed the j
confidence of his brothers. Aaron is no j
longer his business partner and now
comes Edward Heringhi with a tale- of
misplaced confidence, asking the assist
ance of the court to compel Leo to make
restitution of certain property which it is
alleged he Is holding in trust and refuses
to surrender.
Two suits were filed in the Superior
Court yesterday afternoon by Attorney M.
11. Wascerwitz, representing Edward j
Heringhi, with the above object In view. :
The first suit alleges as a cause of com- ;
plaint that plaintiff in IS9I purchased a lot
ln the University tract of M. McCann,
but ad the deed made out in the name
of Leo, because of his confidence In the
latter and wing to the fact that he was
obliged by the nature of his business to
be away from the city a considerable por
tion of* the time. His idea was that in
case he desired to sell the property Leo,
holding the same in his own name, could
attend to the matter without the neces- j
sity of Edward making a trip to the city. :
In June of this year, the complaint al- i
leges, plaintiff demanded the return of the I
property, which demand was refused by
Leo. Now Edward asks that the court re
store the property to him and afford such
additional relief as may be due him.
The other suit recites that Edward pur
chased three lots of F. M. Grlswold and
William Nichol and wife in 1891 .and had
the deeds made out in the name of his
brother for .the me reasons stated
above, the only difference being that Leo
afterward bought a half-interest in these
lots. Edward asks that his "brother be
compelled to transfer a half-interest in
each of th. lots in question to him.
Attorney Wascerwitz says Leo does not I
deny thai Edward paid for the property
he persists in holding on to and he antici
pates no difficulty in securing a judgment.
Edward Heringhi has also Instructed At
torney Wascerwitz to prepare papers in '
a suit against Leo to recover $Â»Â«'â¢. which

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JULY 20, 1599.
AMERICA MARU
HAS BEEN HELD
IN QUARANTINE
One Suspicious Case
on Board.
â â â
INVESTIGATION TO BE HELD
. â â
TWO PLAGUE PATIENTS LANDED
AT YOKOHAMA
â  â¦
Japanese Was Taken 111 on July 7,
but His Sickness Is Said to
Be Pneumonia or
Pleurisy.
The Japanese steamship America Maru,
a sister ship of the Nippon Maru, arrived
in port yesterday afternoon and was im
mediately ordered into quarantine. At
Yokohama two cases of bubonic plague
caused the vessel to be detained several
days, and on July 7 a Japanese appren
tice was taken ill with what has the
symptoms of pneumonia and pleurisy.
This latter patient is convalescent, but
his ailment is being made the subject of
un investigation by the local quarantine
authorities. Until this investigation is
completed the America Maru will be held
in quarantine at Angel Island. Should
the case develop to be nothing more than
a disease of the lungs, the vessel will in
all probability dock very soon.
The America Maru left Hongkong on
June 13 and Kobe on June 21. Before ar
riving at Yokohama, on June 23, two cases
of bubonic plague developed, which caus
ed the vessel to be placed In quarantine.
Dr. Walker, the ship's physician, had the
two infected Japanese taken ashore and
on the day following its arrival the ves
sel was thoroughly dlsinfectetd. On June
30 it was released and proceeded to Hono
lulu, arriving there on July 12.
On. July 7, and before the America Maru
arrived at the Hawaiian port, another
case of sickness was reported. A Japa
nese apprentice was taken ill and there
were some symptoms of the dreaded af
fliction. The stop at Honolulu was short,
and on July 13 the ship commenced its
voyage to San Francisco. During the trip
across the Pacific the Japanese grew
Utter and has at the present time almost
recovered. When the ship touched Angel
Island last evening it was boarded by Dr.
Klnyoun of the quarantine station, who
commenced an investigation of the case.
At a late hour last evening he had come
to no positive conclusion. The physician
gave the following statement to the
press:
America Maru left Hongkong June 13; Kobe,
June 21; Yokohama, June 23. Two cases of
plague were aboard and the vessel was placed
In quarantine at the latter place and disin
fected. ]>IÂ«lnfection completed June 24, dis
charged June 30, arrived In Honolulu July 12
ami left for San Francisco July 18. Japanese
apprentice taken ill on July 7. Symptoms of
pneumonia and pleurisy; almost recovered,
Vessel will be held as a precautionary meas
ure to await further Investigation.
DR. KIKYOUN.
The quarantined ship carries sixty-five
cabin passengers, forty-one soldiers and
seventy Chinese and Japanese. The case
of the* Japanese is the only one of sick
ness which has been on board since leav
ing Yokohama. Nothing was taken on
shore last night, but the mail will be
fumigated as soon as possible and landed.
VALUES OF MINES ARE
HARD TO DETERMINE
â¢ - -
No Law to Force Statements, Says
the State Mineralogist, Who Is
Preparing a Register.
The State Mineralogist is preparing a i
register of the mines and minerals of the
State, with â¢ Illustrations of the mines,
names of superintendents and route
maps. The register will contain much I
valuable Information, but it will not show
just how much money has been dug out
of the generous gold-bearing earth of
California. Mr. Jacobs, the secretary of
the State Mineralogist, states freely and
unreservedly thai this missing informa
tion would do much to straighten out
rascalities practiced by unscrupulous
mine owners on Innocent persons dis
posed to make Investments. â¢"â¢".:
"We would like," said he yesterday, "to
give the public statistics showing what
the output of the mines of the State ar":,
but the owners refuse to volunteer the :
statements and we cannot force them to
do so. 1 believe an attempt was made
once to introduce legislation compelling '
mine owners to give sworn annual state
ments, but the bill was defeated. The
fact is that the absence of any regula- .
tions In this matter is productive of
frauds upon persons who are led to be
lieve that certain mines are profitable
Investments when the properties have re
ally been 'salted.' I think, however, that
this sort of trickery is confined to owners
of small mines, who make a business in
some instances of buying such claims and
Belling them to unsuspecting people."
The report about to be Issued by the 'â 
State Mineralogist will be first published .
in short bulletins by counties, and when j
the series Is completed the entire matter
will be comprised and issued in a sipgle j
volume.
"Coasted" and May Die.
Joseph Nelson, a schoolboy, aged 15
years," son of John Nelson, residing at I**
I,askie street, met wRh a serious accident
yesterday afternoon while "coasting" on
his bicycle* down Hill street. The boy lost
control of his wheel as be was nearing
Valencia street, and when the machine
reached the rough pavement he was
thrown with considerable force from his
seal onto the basalt blocks. He was
picked tip and conveyed to his home.

REPORT OF THE PIONEERS.
A Splendid Financial. Showing in the
Annual Statement Just Issued.
Fifty-two members of the society of Cal
ifornia Pioneers died during the year end
ed June 30. 1899. The annual report of the
society, just published, gives the Infor
mation. One by one and with painful re
iteration the argonauts and history mak
ers of California are passing away, and
the perpetuation of the stanch old organ
ization is depending with increasing re
sponsibility upon the junior members of
the society. tftf ;
Among the notable deaths were those of
five ex-vice presidents of the Pioneersâ
Dr. Washington Ayer, T. G. Phelps, Henry
Matthews, ex-Governor Romualdo Pache
! co and Justice Stephen J. Field.
The annual report shows that the re-
I ceipts during the past twelve months were
:$ 9 004 79 and the disbursements during the
â¢ same period $32,390 63. The society had a
! comfortable balance on hand nt the com
mencement of the year, however, and tne
: cash remaining in the general fund now
amounts to $26,108 15. The assets of the
society are given as $546,701 48.
The sum of $9241 35 was expended for tÂ»;e
relief of forty memebrs requiring aid.

or without removal. J. Noonan, 1017-1023 Mission.

REVOLUTION IN THE
EXCLUSION PROCEDURE
TREASURY SOLICITOR O'CON
NELL'S RULING.
Act of 1888 Declared to Be in Force
* and Chinese Laborers Will Be
Handled More Rigorously.
Maurice D. O'Connell, solicitor of the
! Treasury, has notified Collector Jackson
I of a new ruling which will revolutionize
I the procedure with regard to the exclu
; sion of Chinese. Solicitor O'Connell holds
i that the act of Congress of September,
j 18SS, is good so far as sections 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
10, 11, 13 and 14 are concerned and that
those sections did not depend upon the
ratification of the treaty, therefore becom
ing operative immediately.
The first paragraph of the act of Sep
tember, ISSB, provides that from and after
the date of the exchange of the ratifica
tions of the pending treaty between th'Â»
' United States and China, signed on March
12, 1888, it should be unlawful for a*"*/
i Cninese person or subject of China or of
any other power to enter the United
States except as provided by the act.
On October 16 of the same year the
i solicitor of the Treasury decided that
i "the act never went into operation and
j is of no binding force for the reason that

it Is dependent on the ratification of the
treaty with China, which ratification was
never made."
By reason of this decision Collectors of
Customs have disregarded the act of 1888
and have worked under the provisions of
the Chinese exclusion act of 1852 and 1884
and the treaty of 1894.
Under the acts and the treaty just men
tioned a Chinese laborer about to leave
the United States and applying for a cer
tificate entitling him to return had to
allege that he had a wife or parent in
this country dependent upon his labor;
that he had property here, or i.-at the sum
of $1000 or more was owing aim. Promis
sory notes were accepted by the Collector
as proof of the debt. Under the new rul
ing the laborer must furnish proof that
he has been married for at least a year
followed by continuous cohabitation, â¢or
that his property or debts are bona fide.
In the case of debts he must prove that
they are unascertained and unsettled, and
promissory notes will be of no value as
proof. He must also make his applica
tion a month prior to the date of his de
parture. It is necessary also for the Col
lector to take the full description of the
applicant, retaining the description in his
own possession and giving on the certifi
cate simply the number of the descrip-
tion. ' . , .
Also lf the applicant has remained more
than a year in China he must produce a
certificate from the American Consul at
the Chinese port of departure to the effect
that the applicant was detained over time
by sickness.

THE POLICE CENSURED.
: Patrick Fitzgibbons Should Not Have
Been Arrested Even for
Battery.
Patrick Fitzgibbons. whose arrest Fri
day night for the alleged attempt to
strangle May Burke, a woman of the
"tenderloin," caused a brief sensation, ap
peared before Judge Treadwell yesterday
on the charge of battery. The woman
and her friend. Maggie O'Brien, told their
stories and the defendant told of the at
tempt to blackmail him. Frank Barrls, a
saloon-keeper in the Mission, and others
testified to the defendant's good character
and the Judge dismissed the case.
"The arresting officers," said the Judge,
"had no right to arrest the defendant
without due process of law simply be
cause two women of bad reputations
asked them to do it. Many a reputable
man *o my personal knowledge has been
unjustly arrested on the complaint of
such women solely with the object of pre
venting their own arrest. In the present
case I am satisfied that an attempt was
made to blackmail the defendant and he
was justified in protecting himself."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. July 19.â Intense dullness
of the stock market continued to be the main
feature of the trading to-day, as for some
time past. Not only was it true of the New
York market, but of the Continental and Lon
don markets as well, and speculation at dif
ferent exchanges in the United States was re
ported in the same dull and neglected condi
tion. The whole speculative world maintained
Its waiting attitude. Many factors which have
been adduced to account for the hesitation
have been successfully eliminated and the hesi
tation still persists. The bears took some heart
from this tinned disinclination to advance
and made a vigorous attack on the New York
market late to-day. Earlier gains in some of
the specialties, were wiped out, notably ln the
tobacco stocks, in s-:*.--.' and in steel and wire,
and the whole market dropped to the low level
of the day. Miss Pacific and Wabash pre
ferred led the decline, the latter with a net
loss of 1%. The grangers ail weakened sharply
end Atchison preferred was notably heavy In
tone. Brooklyn Transit lost the greater part
Of yesterday's gain and Manhattan dropped a
point below last night. Metropolitan Street
Railway, on the contrary, resisted the -lin
ing tendency and closed unchanged. Federal
Bteel common fell away heavily 2 points in the
late trading although the public announce
ment that the judicial injunction against, the
distribution of the dividend declared on the
stock was not made until after the market's
close. New York Air Brake made a meteoric
Sisplay on yesterday's judicial decision affirm
ing the validity of one of its . tents. The
Btock opened up 17 points and then fell 20
points and closed with a net decline of 1
point. The close was at 206 bid and 220 asked.
The market enjoyed a period of .some strength
early in the day. but the transactions were on
such a small scale as to lend little signifi
cance .to the movement of prices.
Bonds were intensely dull and prices moved
Sluggishly. Total sales, par value, $1,861,000.
United States 3's coupon advanced 14, old
I's registered and the new 4's registered "4 in
the bid price.

CHICAGO. July 19.â The price of flour drop
ped 20c a barrel to-day and it Is now cheaper
than for some time. The price to Jobbers fell

upturn. The drop Is said to be due to the
steady decrease in the price of wheat.

HAT AND FEEDSTUFFS.
The heavy receipts of Hay have produced j
the expected effect and prices are declining. J
The circular of Somers & Co. says:
"Hay has been moving off fairly readily, but
the last day or two the market shows some j
signs of weaken ! -g. the decline yesterday be- j
ing especially marked, about 60c per - ton all
around. Many consumers are laying away a
good supply, which is helping to relieve the
market, but In spite of this fact prices can
not stand a continuous rush of hay. An oc
casional day of -heavy receipts will not percept- ]
ibly affect prices, but several days running will ;
surely cause a weakening. Prices are low ;
enough as it is, but there seems to be no limit i
to which prices can drop in the face of heavy
receipts.
"There is not much to be told of the hay
market at the -.resent time. The general qual
ity of the hay now being marketed is very good
âgreen and free from weed, with considerable
of It perhaps a trifle rank. The volunteer j
crop, more notable because of its scarcity last
year, is all very good quality, being for the
most part wild rat hay, line, clean and green. ,
Very little old hay is noticed on the market, j
and what little there is seems to be somewhat
neglected, the brighter appearance of the new j
crop proving more attractive to buyers. Some .
few consumers still demand old hay, so an oc
casional good sale is made other than this
prices-range about the same as for new hay."

MEHRMANN ADMITS
THE SECRET DEAL
James McCarthy Says That Mur- j
der Was Threatened, *
five Thousand Dollars in Gold Coin Was to Have Been
Paid to the Coroner in San Jose- Another
Gun Loaded
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
SOS Broadway, July 19.
THE exclusive publication in to-day's
Call of the celebrated secret con
tract between Coroner Mehrmann
and Messrs. Blair, McCarthy and
Clark created as much consterna
tion among the politicians as if some one
had exploded dynamite on Broadway.
Additional revelations regarding the re
markable county campaign of last fall
ur-^ being made hourly, and a most in
tricate yet pretty series of political con
spiracies have been unfolded. Apparently
I: bi gah last August, when Coroner Bald
win and Dr. Mehrmai were fast friends.
A little deal was agreed upon by which
Menrmanr. was to receive the support of
Baldwin and in return Baldwin was to be
given a fair share of the autopsy work
of the Morgue* A little later it developed
that Dr. Tisdale of Alameda wanted
something, and it was suggested that he
be appointed physician to the County Jail.
Dr. Baldwin was after that place and it
was supposed that he had sufficient votes
in the Supervisors to appoint him. Dr.
Tisdale was to have all the autopsy work
In Alameda but this was not considered
sufficient for him by his political friends.
Finally Dr. hrmann was elected and
several months passed by without Dr.
Tisdale receiving any autopsy work in
Alameda or Dr. Baldwin any in Oakland.
Then the Supervisors mixed up In the
quarrel over ratronage and it is said that
the Coroner made some uncomplimentary
remarks about Will Church which pro
voked a lively discussion with Dr. Bald
win. One thing led to another until the
Supervisors suddenly discovered that I"
Menrmam was overcharging the county
in the matter of fees. Th. th. storm
burst and reached its climax with the
publication of the secret contract to-day,
following on Dr. Mehrmann's ten thou
sand word arraignment of the Board of
Supervisors.
Dr. Mehrmann positively denies that he
ever received money, but freely admits
the existence and the signing of the con
tract. He denies that he ever threatened
to smash Undertaker McCarthy's head if
he divulged the secrets of the deal.
Mr. McCarthy's version of this inci
dent is as follows:
"One morning," he said, "-I re
ceived a telephone message before
breakfast, asking me to go to Dr.
Mehrmann's office. I declined to go
until I had had my breakfast, al
though the doctor told me that the
business was of the greatest im
portance. We went into a room and
the doctor shut the door. He then
held out his fist and said, 'If any one
of you fellows ever breathes a
word of this contract business I will
blow your heads off.'
** 'Sit down, doctor," I said, 'you
wouldn't blow the head off a fly. You
are too much of a coward.' 'Well,
you bet that somebody will get licked
if this thing gets out.' 'Keep calm,
doctor.' I said, 'I am a pretty able
fellow myself, and if there is any
licking going to be done I am not go
ing to be the fellow that will be
licked."
"I then told him that instead of
auarreling we had better get down
to business, and he promised me that
I should have one-third of the busi
ness of the Morgue if I did not squeal
and that if I did squeal the conse
quences would be most alarming. I
told him that, he could not prevent me
from squealing if I wanted to, and
that if I felt inclined I would go out
on Broadway and bawl out the whole
proposition."
This Interview is denied totally by Cor
oner Mehrmann.
To-night Dr. Mehrmann authorized the
publication of the following statement:
I do not deny that a. business contract was
catered Into by me for the furnishing of a.
Morgue such as I consider Â» Morgue, as I had
g..ne through the campaign on the platform
that 1 would get a public Morgue from the
county if I could: . -
This contract was entered into after having
been 'vised by good legal authority that this
county could not furnish a public Morgue. I
had refused to enter Into an proposition with
(lark and Hlatr, as I did not destre to have it
said that I imported undertakers from Sacra
n'.'-nto to take the -Morgue. I then thought nf
either Brown or McCarthy, the latter of whom
1 considered my friend at the time.
I desire to deny emphatically that I was
ever offered or ever received the sum of $5000,
J6OOO $7000 or any other sum for placing the
Morgue. There la nothing in the contract
which in any way compromises *J- n - v of those
agreeing to it. Â" , Â .
It was agreed that the expenditures of fitting
up the Morgue with proper appliances were
not to be less than JSOOO. This was the son-
Blde'ratlon of value on my ; art, as stated in the
contract. This contract would have been con-
BUmmated had McCarthy played fair on the
j. reposition. The arrangement on the part of
the undertakers was something like this: Itlair
and Clark were to each pay McCarthy JBOOU for a
two-thirds interest in his business. McCarthy
was to receive $1000 ea.=h. The her $5000 each
was to be put Into a common pooled fund of
1 17.. 000, toward which McCarthy wok to sub
scribe ?r.OOO. When the time came for thin
<leal to be put through McCarthy insisted on
petting $3000 cash and thai the pool was only
J'jOOu. Blair and Clark refused to come down,
saying $15,000 was the agreement and that $StHX)
was not enough. Finally McCarthy agreed to
take $2000, with a $12,000 pool. Then the other
two withdrew together and when McCarthy
said "I*ll stand in, boys," they wouldn't listen
to him;
My enemies have simply been â -â¢ Ing to whia
per.me to death by saying that 1 accept. $".o*oo
Of th. new Hem and that I tot 17000 from
Brown. 1 have never seen any money. Mr.
Brown has lived up to my proposition to fur
nish me a good Morgue as well as his space
permitted.
A- for the Supervisors being asked to take
the contract off my hand!) I know â â¢â¢thins;
whatever, and as to my exhibiting a pistol or
threat. McCarthy it is a fabrication made
out of whole cloth. When McCarthy and his
associates met in my ofilce and could not agree,
I told them frankly they could do as they
pleased with their contract. Never at any time
was there any secrecy oil my part. Mr. Brown
was tlie first one to know of these negotia
tions with McCarthy. When January 1 ar
rived and he bad no preparations made for the
Morgue. I considered, as did Blair an.l Clark,
that there were no relations between us.
\ threatened expose of this contract has been
used as a means to thwart my report made
Monday before the Supervisors. Had I aught
to fear I might not have made my statement.
As late as Monday a party went to my attor
ney and said i had better go slow.
I have not ucccepted a dollar in the whole
deal. I want to fay that I have another 13
--inch gun to fire, and It is loaded with slugs.
Discussing the matter to-day James L.
McCarthy said:
"I signed th.-- contract in the presence
of Mr. Clark and Dr. Mehrmann. There
was a clause In It agreeing to pay coroner
hrmann $5000 for giving us the Morgue.
Dr. Mehrmann said he did not want the
consideration named In the contract. Mr.
Clark has the contract in his possession.
Tt ii. ; agreed that Clark should pay the
(g^iactii
money in pold coin in San Jose and that
it would then he changed into green
hacks. Mehrmann did not want to take
the money in Oakland. I have several
times demanded the contract from Clark,
but could not get it."
DISLIKED BEING DIVORCED.
Christian Abraham Slaps His Wife
Because She Sued for a
Separation.
ALAMEDA. July 19.â Christian B.
Abraham, whose wife, Augusta Abraham,
sued him for a divorce yesterday, is to
day defendant to a charge of battery. In
which his wife is also the complainant.
He got real mad when the divorce com
plaint was served on him and. it' is
claimed, gave his wife a whipping for tak
ing such proceedings.
The Abrahams have been married for i
twenty years. Their home is at 615 Rail
road avenue. According to the divorce
complaint Abraham acquired the bad j
habit of spanking his wife whenever any \
of the household affairs went awry. When
he received legal notlticatlon that he was
defendant in a divorce suit he concluded ,
that Mrs. Abraham had gone a little too
far. As soon as he could find her he gave '
her a scolding and wound up the inter- >
view by boxing her ears. He was arrested \
by Constable Wahmuth and released upon ,
depositing $100 ash bail.
Funeral of Howard Havens.
i ALAMEDA, July 13.â The funeral of the
! late Howard Havens took place this
morning from the residence, 1031 San An
tonio avenue. A large number of San
Francisco friends of the deceased, Includ
ing many members of the Pioneer So
ciety, were present. The services were
extremely simple and brief, and were con
ducted by Rev F. S. Brush, pastor of
the First* Presbyterian Church. A cor
tege of a dozen carriages followed the
body to Mountain View Cemetery, where
the interment took place.
The pallbearers were J. F. Pinkham,
H. H. Welch, W. G. Doolittle, E. B. Vree
land, for the Society of California Pio
neers; J. A. Donohoe, Isadore Burns, Mr.
I Clark and Columbus Bartlett.
The Jury Was Sympathetic.
ALAMEDA, July 19.â Frank Goldstone
was acquitted to-day of the charge of
participating In the torturing of little
Aristo Rea. The evidence went to show
that Goldstone enticed the lad into La
Plant's butcher shop at Grand street sta
tion where, with the assistance of some
companions, the boy was subjected to
various indignities and was nearly scared
out of his wits. The defendant excused
his action by claiming that the Rea boy
had been a nuisance about the shop and
â â¢ that he was Instructed to scare him so he
i would keep away. A sympathetic jury
' took the latter view of the matter, and
after deliberating for an hour brought in
a verdict of not guilty.
Alameda School Matters.
ALAMEDA. July 19.â Miss Kathryn E.
Stone, formerly teacher of music in the
Alameda schools, has resigned to fill a
similar position in the schools of Los An
geles Last evening the Board of Educa
tion elected Miss Ida Mac Fisher of Ma
dera to fill the vacancy. The subject of
abolishing the system of promoting pu
pils on examinations was discussed. It
was argued that many pupils neglect their
work until near the end of the school
term when they begin to cram for the
examinations. It was suggested to make
promotions on term standing. Superin
tendent Hughes was instructed to make
a thorough investigation of the practi
cability of the proposed change.

DALTON'S ASSESSMENTS
MEET WITH FAVOR
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway. July 19.
The Board of Equalization will meet to
morrow, and as only three days are left
before its term of office expires Assessor
Dal ton Is wondering whether the old fight
of live years' duration between him and
th. railroad is to be considered at an end,
or if Mr. Ryan is to make his annual ap
pearance.
"It would not surprise me," said Mr.
Ballon to-day. "if the Southern Pacific
Company should not appear this year. I
cannot say that I have any Intimation
one way or the other, but In view of the
fact that the Seventh-street local was not
taken off the rolls by the State Board of
Equalization last year, and that it has
since been sold to the State by Tax Col
lector Barber, I cannot see just how they
are going to clear the little tangle. It is
not Tor me to make any suggestions to
them, but the fact remains that the Sev
enth-street local line is now the property
of the State of California until such time
as the Southern Pacific redeems it by pay
ing last year's taxes.
"I have placed the same figures on
THE RISE AND FALL OF SWIFTWATER BILL.
nearly all the railroads with one excep
tion. On the Ist of March the San Pablo
toad and Its equipments were practically
worth nothing The roadbed was being
torn up and there was practically no
street railroad in existence. Under the
law only the actual value of property on
March 1 can be taken into consideration,
and consequently the San Pablo road is
assessed for much less than it was last
year. However, the valuable electric sys
tem they have now Inaugurated has so in
creased its value that next year the
assessment will be much larger than it
has been. On the whole, the assessment
rolls seem to have given almost pel '<
satisfaction to the whole county, as [he
applications for reductions, eliminating a
few . which were merely clerical errors,
amount to comparatively nothing. I can
not but feel gratified that the two water
companies whose franchises escaped tax
ation so long will be forced to pay in
San Francisco, although it would have
been more satisfactory if their taxes
could be paid Into our own treasury, as
they certainly should be."
I PRESIDENT WHEELER
SEES HIS RESIDENCE
The New Head of the Faculty In
spects His Future Dwelling-
Place in Berkeley.
BERKELEY, July 19.â 1t was not gen- j
j erally known among the students of the
! University of California that among other
property belonging to the university is a
J large house at the head of Bancroft way !
i reserved for the president and known as
the president's residence. The house has j
! commonly been known as the Blake resl- !
I dence, being occupied by Mrs. 11. D.
j Blake. It now appears that the building j
; has only been rented by Mrs. Blake, the
real title belonging to the Board of Re
! gents. Ex-President Martin J. Kellogg
waived his right to live there, preferring ,
his own residence at Bushnell place.
Now that President Kellogg Is no longer
the head of the faculty the occupancy of
the Blake house, falls to the new presi
dent-elect. Dr. Wheeler will reside there i
1 while president of the university. The ]
building is situated in a large impound
at the head of Bancroft way, facing Pied- ;
i mont way. and stands between the houses
occupied by Anson S. Blake and Mrs. C.
H. Palmer.
This morning President "Wheeler, ac
companied by Regents Denicke, Rodgers
and Foote. came over to the university i
town and drove at once to the place. The
committee on buildings and grounds of j
! the Board of Regents will have the house
thoroughly overhauled before President !
! Wheeler's return in October, at the same i
j time carrying out a few alterations and

MR. GATES PRESIDENT OF A BIG
CONCERN.
â¦-,
Now Comes the News That He Is
Broke and That His Wealth
Was a Bluffâ His Oak
land Home.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, July 19.
"Swiftwater Bill's" financial collapse, as
described in the statements from Klon- !
dikers who returned to San Francisco yes- i
terday, has surprised many Oaklanders i
who had been tempted to stake a great
deal on Mr. Gates' wisdom and alleged
wealth.
Mr. Phiscator, who with his wife
brought down the largest amount of dust
from the Klondike on the Portland yes
terday, was asked about "Swiftwater
Bill's" prospects. He replied:
"IN. 'Swiftwater Bill' is a financial
wreck. He Is mortgaged for more than he
Is worth, and is hanging about Dawson
virtually doing nothing. Those who know
about his affairs smiled when they heard
of his display of wealth in this city some
twenty-three months ago. He came here
with $10,000 of borrowed money to essay
the role of a plunger. He gave a mort- j
gage of $il'. ! to secure his first loan of
$5000 In cash. Another $5000 in cash he
borrowed and gave a mortgage of $11,000.
In other words, he gave a bonus of $13,000 '
I for the cash he came here with and blew i
, HI." |
Two years ago Mr. Gates blossomed on [
Oakland, carrying a satchel in which
there were said to h $1,800,000. He was
marched around town and paraded by a
: few prominent Oaklanders who put faith
in his promises of what could be accom
plished in the Klondike. Everybody was i
talking of Mr. Gates, and when he pur
chased a beautiful mansion for $20,0*) cash |
in the Lakeside district there was a very
pronounced flutter in Oakland's exclu
sive set. Mr. Gates was to have brought
his dance hall wife with him. and the
width of the swath they were to cut dare
j not be contemplated by Oakland's ma
: trons. .
After he had exploited the purchase of
I the mansion he appeared as the president
; of an Alaskan fortune-making company,
: in which all the investors were guaranteed
enough gold to make them Independent
for life. Two million dollars was the mod
est capital of the Alaska Transportation,
Trading and Mining Company, of which
William C. Gates of Dawson City, N. W. |
Territory, was president and several Oak
landers were prominent in the directory.
The prospectus was Munchausen-Uke
enough to attract even the conservative
people of Oakland. Its capital of two
millions was said to be fully paid, and "if ;
: everything even half meets the expecta
tions dividends of 100 per cent will prob
j ably be declared on this stock before the
year is out."
The year Is out, arid nearly another year
| has succeeded it. and instead of the 100
per cent on "half expectations'' Mr.
1 Frank Phiscator brings the news quoted \
above.

J. Sommers Sues People's Express for
Money He Invested in Ten
Shares of Stock.
OAKLAND, July 19.â John Sommers
filed suit late this afternoon against the
People's Express company, of which he
is a stockholder, for the recovery of $10otÂ»
which he alleges he paid in November,
ISPS, for ten shares of the corporation
stock.
Plaintiff charges "that defendant, with
intent to defraud and deceive him, in
duced him to subscribe for the ten

sented that the corporation was conduct
ed at a great profit to the stockholders,
realizing in July, August, September and
October of last year $200, $400, $600 and
$700 respectively; when In reality the busi
ness was conducted at a loss to said cor
poration.

complaint that he learned last month that
the corporation had neglected to keep
books and accounts of its business, where
fore on June 15 he indorsed his signature

ATTEMPTED MURDER.

She Imagined Her Victim Intended
Killing Her Grandson, Whom
She Herself Had Attack
ed With an Ax.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, July 19.
Armed with a heavy cane and laboring
under an imaginary grievance, Mrs.
Margaret Elizabeth liildebrand murder
ously attacked Mrs. J. Harlan this morn
ing while the latter was on her wav to
the King-Morse Cannery at San Lean
dro, where she is employed.
Mrs. Harlan's screams for help were
promptly answered by other employes at
the cannery, but by the time they arriv
ed the unfortunate woman, who is 72
years of age, was unconscious and Mrs. â¢
liildebrand. who is but two years her
junior, was viciously beating her with
the cane, all the while uttering hopes
that she would die.
After several desperate attempts the
rescuers finally succeeded in overpower
ing the vicious assailant. Mrs. Harlan
was promptly removed to her home at
SaYi Leandro and Drs. K. D. Smith and
J. H. Miller were summoned. The phy
sicians found that the woman's right arm
was fractured and her face and shoul
ders covered with black and blue bruises.
I The physicians are not at all certain that
she will recover.
1 Mrs. Hildebrand was immediately ar
i rested by Town Marsha] Geisenhofer. Her
I relatives, however, promptly made known
the fact that the woman had been men
tally deranged for a long time. She was
taken to the Receiving Hospital, where
Drs. Tisdale and Milton this afternoon
examined her for insanity. Judge Greene
later committed her to the asylum at
Stc'ckton.
Mrs. Hlldenbrand was committed to an
; insane asylum once before. Her imag
inary grievance against Mrs. Harlan is
that the latter recently shot her an.l
killed her dog; that she also intended kill
ing her grandson. Willie Groff, at San
Leandro. So confirmed was the insane
I woman -in this hallucination that about
ten days ago she attempted to kill the
grandson with an ax. solely to frustrate
the Imagined plan of the woman she so
: viciously beat to-day. To the Lunacy
Commissioners Mrs. Hlldenbrand declared
that she had not eat. any food since her
I birthday last August.
Mrs. Louise Groff. her daughter, was
present at the examination, but declined
emphatically to discuss any detail of the
affair. From her It was learned, how
ever, that the afflicted mother has a son.

Anna Mary Gallagher, a spinster aged
52 years, residing at Emeryville, was
'â  also committed to the asylum at Ukiah by
Judge Greene to-day. According to the
testimony taken before the Lunacy Com
missioners her mind became deranged
through over-study. For years she had
prepared to live and die the life of a nun.
A few days ago she became violent and

Receiving Hospital this afternoon for an
infected wound on his right hand, the re
sult of an objectionable osculation by a
kissing bug. "i was walking along the
street," said Mr. Flynn, "when suddenly
I felt something alight on my lower lip.
I brushed it away with my right band
and was stung for my trouble. My hand
began swelling almost immediately and I
hurried to the hospital as quickly as my
legs would carry me, for I instantly re
alized that I had been stung by one of
those kissing bugs. They're a fine lot, but
1 want no more of them." Flynn says the
thought of capturing the bug never en

Â»
Should the Street Superintendent
Now Be Displaced a More Lu
crative Job Would Be
Given Him.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 19.
Tho many friends of Mr. Miller, the
Street Superintendent, who have been ;
working hard for his reappointment,
would now be pleased to have Mayor
Snow name his successor. This Is the
view of the new situation at the City
Hall, taken by some of the politicians.
The two little resolutions introduced
last Monday night, appropriating $5000 for
"a competent engineer" to prepare plans
for a street sprinkling plant ami for sew
ering the annexed district, are said to
be part of a neat little plan to make up
in a measure for Mr. Miller's disappoint
ment at not beirig elected City Engineer. j
There seems little doubt that it is the
determination of the Council that this
work shall be done by City Engineer
Clement. Just whom it will fall to is not
quite clear, but attention is called to the
fact that it would be a very nice appoint
ment for Mr. Miller should he lie tree to I
accept it. . , '
The salary of Street Superintendent for
two years is but $3600, and there is a
great deal of work attached to the office.
The $5000 to be paid for "a competent
engineer" would not entail anything like
two years' work and would he a very
preferable job to the one now held by
the Street Superintendent. â,,,'Â»,.
It is not at all likely that Mr. Miller
will resign from Ins present office, and it
is just as certain that the Mayor will
never vote to put him out of office. 1 nis
new phase of the situation is arousing
much interest among the City liall poli
ticians. 'â -;.â  . ._- ?.;;
It is said that an engineer other than
the City Engineer cannot be employed to
do original work, such as preparing plans,
but that the city can always legally em
ploy an expert to supervise any work
that may be in progress. This point was
thoroughly decided several years ago, i
when Mr. Hering was engaged by the
city to supervise the sewer system then
laid down. ,
Should this alleged programme be car
ried out, Mr. Miller could then be the
overseer of the work of his rival, Monte
Clement.
TREACHEROUS SINK
TAKES MORE ROADBED
A HUNDRED FEET OF EMBANK
MENT DISAPPEARS,
Almost Went Out of Sight While the
Watchman Employed to Keep
Track of It Turned
His Back.
ALAMEDA, July 19.-The Southern Pa
cific Company is experiencing more trou
ble keeping its tracks across the San
Leandro marshes above ground and
where they can be of service for passage
of trains. More than a hundred feet of
the roadbed disappeared this morning in
the treacherous ooze of "the sink." The
appetite of the greedy â¢'sink" for railroad
Iron, ties, piles, boxcars and other rail
road equipage has never been satisfied.
Up to Sate it has deprived but one hu
man being of life, but that the list of fa
talities at the place is not greater is not
due to extra precautions on the part o.
the railroad company or lack ot attempt
oh the part of "the sink.
Within ten minutes after the night
watchman passed over the place th:**
morning and reported it sound over 100
feel of .the roadbed sank out of sigat
in the mud. leaving the rails and ties
suspended in air. At the location of the
present difficulty there was an embank
ment extending eight feet above Lie
marsh level. This has entirely disappear
ed The company was notified of the
disaster at 6 o'clock this morning in tune
to stop traffic over the line. Passengers
to and from Santa Cruz and San Jose
have been taken over the place all day
on hand cars, the company not caring to
run the risk of sending trains over the
temporary . roadbed constructed this
morning. , , Â â
The amount of damage done and the
length of roadway destroyed is nearly
twice that of any of the previous dis
asters To-. lav's sink knocks out com
pletely the theory of the railroad and its
engineers that the ebb and flow of the
tide in the channel along the r tracrf jlwas
responsible for the trouble. The slough
was dammed last April and the tide water
diverted to other channels, and still the
roadbed sinks. V , ' . . ,â¢
A temporary track is being constructed
around the sink, and if nothing can be
dope to keep the sink from sinking the
railroad company will change ifs line en
tirely across the marshes.
LOCAL AGENTS TO GET

The Board of Education Adopts the
Policy of Patronizing Berke

BERKELEY. July IP.â At the meeting
of the Board of Education held in the
Turn Hall last night the School Directors
unanimously resolved that in the future
â¢ill insurance on school buildings within
the city shall he given to local agents of
companies in preference to Oakland or
San Fiancisco houses. The matter was
introduced by Director J. R. Little as
chairman of the Finance Committee in
submitting a report upon the expiration
of the insurance upon the Lorin School.
Director Little called to the board's at
tention the fact that the policy had been
made out from an Oakland office. He
asked permission from the board to have
the new policy issued by a Berkeley agent.
The directors discussed the question at
some length, finally concurring that here
after that plan should be pursued with
out exception.

ALIBI THAT MAY
SAVE CORCORAN
Witnesses Testify for the
Defendant.
â â¦ â
TELL OF HIS MOVEMENTS
â â
NOT IN WARDNER AT THE TIME
OF THE RIOTS. L
â¦
Important Evidence Given in Behalf
of the Miner Who Is Accused
of Having Had a Hand
in Cheyne's Murder.
Special Dispatch to The 'all.
WALLACE, Idaho. July 19.â The prose
cutlbn In the Corcoran murder case is
confronted by an alibi, which traces the;
defendant's movements during almost
every hour of the time when the riots at
Wardner were In prog-re-- More than j
a dozen witnesses have been introduced
who tell in detail where and when they
saw Corcoran in Burke during the hours
that the train left and returned with the â 
dynamiters on board. .
One of the most important was Mrs.
White, who runs the telephone office
there She swore that about 5 o'clock a
call came from Wallace for Mr. Corcoran.
\t that time she could not find him.
Forty minutes later Wallace again called
up and asked if the train was yet in.
Mrs White went outside to see out wuna
that it had not arrived. While looking
for it she saw Mr. Corcoran near tne
union hail, and, calms him over, had him
respond to the Wallace call. ]
Her evidence was in direct conflict wan
that of the Colburr.s. who swore that they
saw him riding back on the train on top
of a boxcar with a gun in his lap.
Another element ln favor of tne pris- i
oner was the evidence of two bra â semen- â 
Dan Conners and Pat E_ee_ur_ They
swore that it was impossible for a man to
*it on the side of a boxcar with his feet
hanging over while the train was travel
ing up such a crooked track as that lead
ing into Burke.
The defense will close its case to-mor
row. -

Pain? and aches come from excess of

THE controversy for possession of
the Democratic works is bring
to the front politician
J. high and low degree. Rainey
and La wrer.ee are arm in arm,
politically speaking, and Jimmie Phe
lan is agitated and alarmed at the
sight of tho Examiner-Kainey combine.
Jaspar McDonald, chairman of the
Democratic Committee of One Hun
dred, hardly knows what to think of
thV- Dawrenee-Rainey fellowship. The
one hundred place-seekers who denied
their authority to boss the party in
the city of San Francisco from the
State Central Committee supposed
that they had letters patent on Mayor
Phelan, hence their surprise and
chagrin to find Lawrence and Rainey
advertising the Mayor as a special at
traction and assuming management of
the Phelan political future.
In days not long gone the Examiner
hi Id up Rainey to public scorn as an
odious boss and ballot-box stuff er. He
was placed so low down in the scale
of depravity that he was cartooned
along with D. M. Burns.
A great change has come over the
spirit of Lawrence. Rainey is now re
garded as Saintly Sam, and his in
spiring presence is daily demanded to
arrange tlie details of the approach-
Ins: municipal campaign. Sam is in the
saddle, and Phelan must ride behind
if he wants to go along with th.- push.
One who cares to study the dim past
may always nml interesting old thing*
in the Examiner. Back in 1892 Rainey
-was denounced in that journal as a
heeler and ruffian.' On October 7, 1892,
the Examiner propounded this Inquiry:
Are the voters willing to see
the election decided by having
the names of thousands of im
aginary men put on the register
and their names voted by a
few hundred rounders under the
orders of Kelly, Crimmins and
Rainey?
October 12. 1892. four days later, the
Examiner had not hanged its tone. It
then said:
The Election Commissioners
know that the gang has neither
authority or reputation. They
know that it represents nothing
but Sam Rainey and his efforts
to carry enough Democratic
votes away from the Democratic
party to elect the plug-ugly
ticket and give Crimmins and
Kelly the city to plunder.
â¢ Â» â¢
The commissioners have no
more right to declare the
Rainey-Long gang of political
highbinders to be the Demo
cratic party of the city than
they have to pick up any con
vict in Quentin and give him
the right to name the candidates
and officers of the organization.
A cartoon went with the outburst, of
rage. Five dangling ropes, each with
a hangman's noose, were pictured over
this text: "AN EXASPERATED
COMMUNITY MAY RESORT TO
EXTREME MEASURES."
It was therein suggested that the
people should hang the Election Com
missioners for recognizing the Rainey
heelers.
Many changes have taken place
since* 1592 when Rainey was so bad.
and the Examiner so good. It is now
the fact that they are together. Per
haps Rainey has ascended the road of
purity and reform to meet Lawrence
at the summit, or perhaps the Exam
iner has gone down the grade of po
litical depravity to meet Rainey at the
bottom.
In October, 1894, the Examiner and
Rainey were wide apart in politics.
Rainey was tht-n cartooned as a ballot
box tuff <"*r in the house of Dan Burns
the taxidermist. Later on the same
year Rainey and Burns were cartooned
r.s wild beasts in a cage, where Hunt
ington, the trainer, reposed. Rainey
was the tiger and Burns the lion.
Speaking of dexterity 77 the stuffing
of votes, the Examiner paid this com
pliment to the incomparable genius of
Rainey:
The rolls have been stuffed as
Suckley in his boldest days and
in the height of his power
never dared to stuff them.
A note of alarm was once sounded
by the Examiner. Here is the note:
""THE CITY IS IN DANGER FROM
THE THUG RAINEY."
The present Sam Rainey, who is do
ing pure politics in company with A.
M. Lawrence, Is the same Sam Rainey
that the Examiner referred to in 1892
and 1894. The Call has investigated
the subject and found that the big boss
is the same old Sam that graduated
from the Buckley Institute of Heelers.
He has simply changed his location
from the St. George stables to the Ex
aminer office.
PREPARING FOR BATTLE
Delegates of District Leagues
Will be Announced Next
Week to the Voters.
The Central Committee of the City Re
publican Leagues met in the Grand Hotel
last evening and discussed the report of
the chairman of the District Committee in
reference to the organization of district
clubs and the selection of delegates for
the forthcoming Republican primaries.
The general opinion among the commit
teemen present was that the delegates
should be prominently announced a week
before the election, although a few mem
bers thought such a procedure would be
playing into the hands of the other ele
ment considered dominant in local Repub
lican politics. There was a lengthy dis
cussion, and the end of it was that defi
nite action was postponed until the next
meeting of the committee.
In the absence of President Henry Scott
the meeting was called to order by Vice
President Joseph Hyman.
Chairman Dodge of the District Commit
-,. reported that no meetings had been
held in the districts publicly, although
organization was proceeding quietly but
certainly in the districts through the sub
committee men in charge.
"Shall we advertise our meetings," said
Mr. Dodge, "or shall we attract support
ers by making a personal canvass; by
meeting reputable Republican voters of
the various districts and inducing them
to join our movement? That is one of
the questions we now have to consider.
Between now and next Wednesday we
I wMll have rlceided upon the names of the
I delegates to represent us at the primaries.
I We must now say whether their names
j shall i". published a day or a week before
the date of the election. The policy of
the regular County Committee has tieen
to publish names of delegates the night
before the primaries. Shall we follow this
example and lead the iters to the polls
like sheep, or shall we feeling confident
; that our men ran stand the test of public j
scrutinyâ announce their names a week or |
! ten days before? Not to publish them in |
: advance si ems to show a lack of confi
dence. To publish them, on the other
1 hand, seems to invite the trickery of the
push element -. Republican politics. No !
j doubt spurious tickets will be Issued, mix- :
ing a few of our delegates with those of |
the regular County Committee. We can j
avoid this danger by exercising due 1
vigilance at the polls. But the question
now -. shall we announce our delegates
openly, in the face of possible dangers
arising from the regular County Commit- j
tee knowing them before the lection, and i
trust to our vigilance to overcome any
strategy used on the other side?"
To bring the matter directly before the
committee, George W. Pennington moved
to publish the names of delegates a week
before the primaries, and the motion was
seconded by Mr. Garrett.
A discussion followed that was partici
pated in by most of the members pres
ent. Dr. W. D. Clark was not in favor
of publishing the names much in advance
of the election. He urged that the work
of the committee should he kept quiet
until the last moment to defeat any at
tempted chicanery on the part of the reg
ular County Committee. He favored the
sending of circulars to the voters, stating
where the ballot tables of the league
â would be In each polling place as an ad
ditional precaution against frauds.
John McDermott took the same view,
arguing that the delegates would be men
of undoubted respectability already too
well known to need announcement in ad
vance.
George W. Pennington answered that I
the element which the league desired to j
reach was of the stay-at-home kind. It
was necessary to announce the names of
delegates in "advance to arouse interest
in the reform movement among these vot- j
ters and offset the work of the "pus!;."
J. B. Whitney arid Oliver Olson spoke
to the same effect. Olson referred to the
dangers arising from factional fights in I
JIMMIE PHELANâ "Say, Mr. Rainey, Let Me Get On Behind?"
SAMâ "Yes, Jimmie, if You Won't Fall Down."
j the districts between opposing leaders,
j and urged the necessity. of harmonizing
i such party discords, "ff we don't," said
1 he, "then look out for the hatchet we
j will get from the disappointed ones."
I. J. Truman saw no dangers in spread
! ing the names of the delegates broadcast.
Neither did James A. Wilson. â¢ "Don't
keep the people in the -dark." he said. A.
R. Smith and James 11. Humphreys were
! In favor of giving the list a week before
j election. It was finally elded that the
I whole matter should be determined at
| the next meeting of the committee, Mr.
I Dodge stating as a reason for postpone
: ment that many of the absent members
j were out organizing clubs and solidifying
the district elements of the league.
I Aft"! adjournment Mr. Dodge stated
'that the work of organization was
.going on satisfactorily, and that by next
Tuesday evening all the district, clubs will
have been formed and the delegates
chosen. ** â â

deputies have had more than they have
been able to attend to and in view 0 '
that fact the Commissioners yesterday
adopted a resolution allowing him ten

Mr Steppacner informed the board that
I it had until August l to either consoli
,l; ie or rearrange the election precincts
of the last election, but at the same time
li,- expressed the opinion that the vote
at the coming election would be fully as
large as at that of last year. Because
of this, he said he would recommend no
reduction in the number of precincts.
The following resolution, which was of
fered by Commissioner Wells, was
adopted:
Resolved. That all political parties- and Indi
viduals taking; advantage of the provisions of
the primary election law permitting the use
of pasters be request- 1 to adopt -a uniform
color, size and type, a sample â¢â ' which may
be procured at the office of the Registrar.
Resolved, That the attached sample, as to
color, size and type, be adopted by the board,
and that the names of delegates on said paster
be printed In brevier type, capitals and small
capitals, with th*> names a uniform distance
apart, the color to be white and its size three
inches wide. tftf'tf
The board adjourned at noon to meet
in the evening, but the only business
transacted was the examination of an
other batch of election officers. Some
difficulty Is being found in getting elec
tion officers who are willing to act, but
us the board has the right to act arbi
trarily in the matter, it will come out all
right. _ -" .v.". â¢-..â â .'-, -- â â ' -."-â¢ tftf â â 'â â
