NEW YORK, July 13.â As
early as 10 o'clock this
morning Herald Square
was well filled with men, women
and children; with bicyclists, tri
cyclists and automobilists, all
eager to witness the Call-Herald
automobile start at 11 o'clock.
Policemen were called upon to
keep the crowds in line. The
clanging of cable-car bells, the
clatter of Sixth avenue elevated
trains and the whir of automo
biles that had come to join in the
escort, all went to make up a
lively scene.
The hands of: the clock on the
beautiful front of the Herald
building indicated 10:55 when
the crowd shouted, "There they
come," and the overland automo
bile ' was seen speeding down
Thirty-fifth street from the direc
tion of Madison avenue, in which
street the Davis' reside. Mr.
Davis had the machine under <
perfect control. He dodged in j
and out and picked his way
through the crowds as carefully
as any pedestrian could have
done it. The automobile re
sponded quickly and nimbly even
to the pressure of' a finger on the
lever bar.
When at the corner of Broad
way and Thirty-fifth street Davis
suddenly wheeled to the right
and brought his machine to a
standstill in front of the main en
trance to the Herald building.
Great crowds immediately surged
around and the police had diffi
culty in restraining them. Al
though the machine was at a
standstill the machinery under
the seat was running at a lively
rate and its whir could be plainly
heard. The engine was throbbing
with energy- while the entire ve
hicle trembled perceptibly. The
Herald editors came down to bid
the venturesome pair "God
speed," and friends pressed for
ward to shake the hands of Mr.
and Mrs. Davis. It was an ani
mated and really dramatic pict
ure. The automobile panted and
quivered like a thoroughbred
fiery steed held in check.
At 11:03 Mr. Davis pressed the
lever and the automobile sprang
forward on its long journey to
The Call building in San Fran
cisco, while the crowd cheered
for the automobilists, the Herald
and Call.
AUTOMOBILES IN A

NEW YORK. July 13.â John Davis
repeated the watchword of the forty
niner.-_as he left this city, accompanied
by his wife, in an attempt to cross the
continent in an automobile to-day. He
took his departure from the Herald
building at three minutes after 11
o'clock this morning. Crowds witness
ed the start and cheered the venture
some tourists as they began their long
Journey, and owners and manufactur
ers, of motor carriages of various makes
united in giving Mr. and Mrs. Davis an
auspicious send-off. In the main par
ade up Fifth avenue were types of
American and French gasoline car
riages and American electric motors,
and regardless of clashing business in
terests the makers of these machines
sent them to accompany the tourists
from the Herald building to Harlem
River.
Herald Square was densely packed

when Mr. and Mrs. Davis, in their
touring car. arrived there. . They were
greeted with cheers, and. a. lane was
made for them to approach the main
entrance of the Herald building. Mr.
Davis displayed great skill in dodging
small boys as he worked through the
crowd. The other automobiles had ar
rived and had been - critically com
mented upon by spectators as they took
position in Broadway to await the
start, but the Davis automibile was at
once recognized as the "real thing." It
had a buggy top to protect its occu
pants from the weather", and' a small
trunk and dress suit case strapped on
behind. Mr. Davis seemed to appreci
ate the difficult task he had undertak
en, but his wife gave the impression
that she was starting for a day's
outing and was as gay as you please
over it. !,^C;._;;..
When the touring cart stopped in
front of the Herald building thousands
rushed forward to get a look at the
machine and its occupants. There were
many women in the crowd. Friends
pressed forward for a final handshake,
and for a few moments there. was
danger of the carriage being over
whelmed. The police eventually suc
ceeded in clearing a small-space.
Two horseshoes suspended from the
front of the vehicle as a token of; good
luck attracted attention, but Mr. Davis
SAN FRANCISCO, FRIDAY, JULY 14, 1899.
explained that he had picked them up
on the road and was not carrying them
to conciliate horse owners".
_ During the brief interval before the
start all eyes were on the automobile.
Except for the speed levers and steer
ing crank and the absence of a horse
in ; front it would have passed for a
physician's gig. Those who were near
the vehicle could hear the motor re
volve when the lever was disconnected,
but- to most of; those in the crowd it
looked like an ordinary' carriage.
â¢ Automobiles were numerous in the
throng that gathered to witness the
start of the longest run for a self-pro
pelled vehicle on record. An Interest
ing -feature of the occasion was the
manner in which. the makers of opposi
tion motors joined in wishing Mr. and
Mrs. Davis â  Godspeed on their Journey.
It was admitted that the successful ac
complishment of the trip would open
up a new feature for American-made
automobiles. There were photographers
ln the crowd, who could "not get good
pictures of the start on account of the
number of neople, and there were per
sons who wanted to shake hands with
the long-distance voyagers so that they
could tell their friends about it after
ward.
At just three minutes after 11 o'clock

opened to form a lane, through which it

a thousand throats as the vehicle
moved into Sixth avenue, crossed the
car, tracks and proceeded in Thirty
fifth street toward . Fifth avenue. It
was escorted -by a string of auto
mobiles. There. was a Duryea trap,
owned by the National Motor Company,
makers of Mr. Davis' touring car. In it
were Arthur S. Winslow, secretary of
the company," Baron Vilaine of Paris,
Henry A. Tuttle and D. F. Graham;
next came Whitney Lyons' electric dos
a-dos trap, driven by A. H. Whiting,
who was accompanied by H. L. McGee;
then there was the handsome theater
bus belonging to - the Rlker Electric
Company of | Brooklyn. The guests in
the bus were Miss Marshall, Miss
White, Miss Tabor and .Messrs. W. L.
Bickwell and H. S. Chapin. A small
Rlker road wagon, upholstered . in red
and with electricity furnishing the mo
tive power, followed the bus. Frank
Duryea, in a surrey with gasoline fur

Captain Whiting, U. S. A., was Mr.
Duryea's guest.

the American Motor- Company joined
the parade in Fifth avenue. One was a
Dedlon tricycle,, in charge of A. A.
Fischer, and the other was a De Cau
ville basket phaeton. Both of these
were operated by gasoline, and, unlike
the American machines, had their mo
tor levers and gears fully exposed to
view; They attracted much, attention
all along the route.
Going up Fifth avenue, Mr. Davis led
â¢the procession at a leisurely pace.
Scores of bicyclists swarmed around his
carriage and handkerchiefs were .waved
to him and his wife. The automobile
moved over the asphalt in Fifth avenue
at moderate speed, owing to the num
ber of other vehicles that were encoun
tered. Above . Fifty-ninth street . the
pace was increased. When up grades
were encountered most of the automo
biles moved more slowly, but the loss
of time was made up on down grades.

The Road Meter Shows -a Run of
Thirty-Seven Miles
Made.

BY JOHN D. DAVIS.
TARRYTOWN, N. V., July
13. â After running three
hours and a quarter we ar
rived here and put up for the
night, intending to start at 4
o'clock Friday morning. So far
the trip has been marked only by
two runaways, many frightened
horses and general ovations from
people along the route. Every
one shows intense interest in the
trip, and we are besieged by peo
ple anxious to photograph the
cart.
The first runaway was near
Kings Bridge and was due to the
driver's carelessness. The second
was just north of Hastings, and
was also due to negligence.
Drivers, as a rule, show more in
terest in the automobile than in
their horses. They allow their
reins to become slack and {heir
horses to gain headway.
Although just from the shops
the motor runs perfectly and has
maintained excellent speed,
climbing hills with ease. The
longest and worst grade was just
north of Yonkers. At Hastings
and beyond we found the best
roads. Care has been taken in
keeping them free - from ditch
holes though Wednesday's storm
has left many ugly washouts.
We were accompanied to some
distance beyond Yonkers by Mr.
Fisher of the American Motor
Company and party, in two of his
motors.
We stopped at Central Bridge
nearly two hours to receive bon
voyage from our escort and an
other stop was made in Yonkers,
luncheon being served in Hast
ings.
In the run to Tarrytown the
road meter shows a distance of
BtrriTW-tttw "â¢' Hfttwx^tr^pt_w*t_psnmÂ»m
thirty-seven miles, and we con
sumed a trifle over two gallons
of gasoline. We stopped here to
adjust the motor, which, owing
to its newness, has a tendency to
become heated, which makes
short runs necessary until the
bearings become properly set.
We will probably not make any
long runs before reaching West
ern New York.

LEXINGTON. Ky.. July 13.â The Repub
lican State Convention adjourned to-night
after being in continuous session since 3
a. m. What was called the Deboe-Taylor
slate was for the most part ratified. Be
fore the convention assembled most of the
delegates were for Taylor for Governor,
and when the nomination for Governor
was reached about all of them were for
Taylor.
The candidates for minor places on the
State ticket were not of the same accord,
so there were contests between the Tay
lor men for the same places. In these
contests there was a vociferous flow of I
Kentucky oratory. In the contest for At- i
tornev General there were forty-seven
speeches by actual count, and during the
day there were over 300 speeches.
After the presentation speech for each i
candidate for the different places there
was such a series of seconding speeches
that it seemed like a ballot would never
be reached. The ballots were not counted
completely. Counties would change their ]
votes to the leading ones or to the win- i
ners and then followed another series of
speeches In withdrawing the names of
those who ran behind.
The presentation of Taylor's name by
his leading opponent. Colonel S. H. Stone,
with the seconding of the same by Judge |
Pratt, his other opponent, was a dramatic :
scene, but the most exciting time of the !
convention was during the contest for
Attorney General. The Taylor men, who
had been making the race for that nomi- !
nation, objected to being sidetracked by
one who had failed for another nomina
tion, and they made an aggressive fight.
Senator Deboe, General Taylor and their
close-friends were active workers in the!
hall during the balloting for Attorney I
General. They wanted Judge Pratt on
the ticket, and they finally nominated him I
by an overwhelming majority. Judge j
Pratt was the favorite of the colored
delegates for Governor.
W. S. Taylor is 46 years old. He was a
poor farmer boy, and taught school'
before he became County Clerk in 1882
While in office he studied law and after
ward was elected Judge. Tic has been a
member of the Republican State Com
mittee since 1886, and was a delegate to !
the National Republican Convention in
Chicago in 1888, He was elected Attorney
General four years ago, when William C. '
Bradley was elected Governor. The lat
ter did not attend the convention here this
week.
GOVERNMENT WILL NOT
INTERFERE IN GUATEMALA
Foreigners Who Bought Central
American Bonds May Lose
Heavily.
NEW YORK. July 13.â A Washington
special to the World says: While the
State Department believes the Guate
malan Government's treatment of for
eign creditors is such as to cause de
mands for redress it Is said that noth
ing has been received indicating that
Germany and Great Britain contem
plate forcible action for the protection
of the interests of their subjects. As
the department has learned that
American citizens are also involved in
President Cabrera's proposition to re
fund Government debts, Minister
â¢Hunter is carefully watching develop
ments in the financial situation and
trying to protect American interests.
An official of the department said that
foreigners who placed their money in
bonds, of Central American republics
expecting to buy them at a low rate and
obtain high interest as compensation"
run the risk of losing all funds invested.
This Government has never inter
fered with financial squabblings of
Central American republics and there
Is no likelihood that it will object to
the naval demonstrations by Great
Britain and Germany, in the interest of
their subjects, provided no infring
ment of the Monroe doctrine is contem
plated.
While expecting a revolution in Gua
temala the State Department does not
take the situation sufficiently serious
to require the dispatch of a ship. Should
fighting occcur or a naval demonstra
tion be made the Vixen will be sent
from Blueflelds and a warship from the
Pacific station sent to the Guatemalan
coast.
A Journal special from San Francisco
declares that a private cipher telegram
from Guatemala says the uprising oc
curred against President Cabrera and
failed. An insurrection took place in
Quezaltenango, led by Feliciano Agui
lar with sixty followers.

CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLING
TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, July 13. â
The mission of General Bates to the Sulu
archipelago for a conference with the Sul- ;
tan is of considerable importance as bear- ,
ing on the future policy of the United i
States. He undertakes the mission on rec- j
ommendation of the Peace Commission,
which was approved by the President. His '
object is to arrange with the Sultan for j
extending American sovereignty over his ,
islands with the understanding that the
present form of government there will i
not be interfered with. In other words,
the Sulu archipelago is to have self-gov
ernment in the full sense of the word.
This is supposed to be indicative of the
policy the administration has in view for
the other islands which will peacefully
acknowledge the sovereignty of the
United States.
Concerning the report that General
Bates will carry $10,000 of Mexican money
as a gift for the Sultan the authorities
are somewhat mysterious, but they say
that the money is not to be offered him as
a bribe.
All they will say officially is that tha
Spanish Government paid the Sultan cer
tain annuities, and General Bates has in
structions wnich contemplate the con
tinuance of the grant, which will be out
of the revenues. The Sultan will retain ;
possession of the pearl fishing and island
trade. The European method of paying
"hush money" to barbarians has always
been repugnant to Americans, and the
coming Congress may have a good aeal
to say about the subject should it be dis
closed that the administration is using
money instead of guns to establish order
in any part of the Philippines.
The President to-day made the follow*
ing appointments in the volunteers:
To be lieutenant colonelâ Robert W.
Leonard, colonel Twelfth New York Vol- (
unteers.
To be majorsâ Francis Ward, lieutenant
colonel One Hundred and Second New

PATHETIC LETTERS FROM
DREYFUS.
ALWAYS IN QUEST OF THE TRUTH
NEW YORK. July Emile Zola may i
be somewhat prejudiced when it !
comes to criticizing the letters of !
Alfred Dreyfus, but it is certain
that the letters in many respects bear !
witness to the truth of his statement, i
This is how Zola described them: "They j
are admirable. I do not know of any ;
pages of a higher conception or more
eloquent. They have attained the |
sublime > in sorrow, and afterward
will endure like an imperishable
monument when our own writings, :
perhaps, shall have passed into oblivion.
For they are the sob itself of all human
suffering. The man who wrote these let- ;
ters cannot be guilty. Read themâ \
them some evening with your family j
gathered around your hearthstone. You ,
I will be dissolved in tears." i
The Dreyfus affair hitherto has been
j like a novel without a heroâ that is, the
hero disappeared in the opening chapter ,
i and it has taken ever since to develop the
J plot and work up a climax which is al- '
| most without parallel for its dramatic
i quality. Enter the hero, mete out justice
i to the villain, and the world is satisfied, j
I These little plays with destiny, the great
. est and most artistic stage manager the
1 world has ever seen, never fail of their ;
! effect, and there is more joy in the world
| over the happy ending in this great his- ;
j toric play, the Dreyfus affair, than could
' be derived from the best novel or short
I story in the world, because the degrada
tion of this innocent man was a thing
I which came home with startling power to
i all peoples. The hero of the tragic story
I was- lost sight of after and in the first
chapter. It-was known where he was, and
i that was almost all. * !
The scene of the story as told hitherto i
I by the newspapers was laid almost alto- I
i gether in France. Cf the scenes laid* in
J l'lle dv Diable, and of the feeling which
; ruled in the heart of a man torn from
1 his family and his honor, the newspapers
; have not" been in a position to speak. It
' had been left entirely to our imagination
to piece out that part of the story until
; the publication of Captain Dreyfus' let-
I ters to his wife closed the gap and com- '
I pleted the sad history of l'affaire Dreyfus. |
The translation of these letters, which j
Harper & Brothers are about to publish
' under the title of "The Letters of Dreyfus
to His Wife," gives us for the first time
; the story in the prisoner's own words;
and it is"a story that for pathos, tragedy,
despair and true Spartan heroism is un
surpassed in the annals of either history i
lor fiction. The arrest, which took place !
I on the 15th of October, 1894, came upon t
' Dreyfus like a bolt out of a clear sky. !
! For* almost two months the liberty of j
writing even to his wife was forbidden,
TELL ABOUT
THE RIOTS
AT WARDNER
Witnesses in the Corcoran
Case Give Interesting
Testimony.
â^â
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WALLACE. Idaho. July 13.â The tes
timony in the Corcoran case to-day was
of the same general nature as that
brought out yesterday. The prosecution
called a large number .of witnesses to
prove the alleged conspiracy. Several
witnesses from Burke and Mullan de
tailed the occurrences of April 29. They
were nearly all members of the miners'
unions, and with few exceptions were
Scandinavians whose knowledge of the
English language was very imperfect.
The evidence showed that on the morn
ing of the 29th the miners at Burke and
Mullan coming off the night shift were
met by a committee who instructed
them to meet at the union hall at 8
o'clock. The day men were similarly
instructed.
At the Mullan meeting the question of
masking was discussed and voted down,
"the men declaring they were American
i citizens and were going to do nothing
of which they were ashamed. The wit
nesses all understood the visit to Ward
ner to be for the purpose of giving
moral support to the strikers. It was
brought cut, however, that masks and
guns were furnished the men in the
union hall at Burke and that the Mul
lan delegation procured a quantity of
arms from a barn while on the way to
Wallace to meet the train.
Dr. 1. S. Collins of Burke gave some
testimony which went far toward show
ing guilty knowledge and intent on the
part of the Burke miners. He was re
turning along the railroad from a visit
to a patient and' had to pass the rioters
train standing at the depot. He was
ordered by masked men to get aboard.
He pleaded professional duties, but was
told that his patients could look after
themselves, and that he might be
needed below. At Wardner he was In
structed to remain near the train, and
If he heard any shooting to immediately
repair to the scene of disturbance. He
obeyed, and after the first volley went
down to the Bunker Hill concentrator
and was directed to the spot where lay
the body of Smith, who expired a mo
ment after the arrival of the physl-
Joe Riddle, a precocious youth of 13
living at Mullan, related how his
mother had told him there was going to
be trouble at Wardner, and that to see
the fun he had accompanied the men on
the day of the riot. Witness proved to
be an intense sympathizer with Union
ism and created considerable laughter
by telling how he had "jacked up" Sin
clair because he had 'promised to send
the youth to school. The boy has been
under arrest for some time, but de
clared he would rather take chances
with the "dynamiters than the Bunker
Hill crowd." - â,_'-,
Companies A and L, First Cavalry,
were today removed to Wardner under
order of Major Smith. Many of their
horses have died here, caused by being
leaded. The concentrators up the can
yon use the river as a dumping place
and the horses became poisoned in eat
ing their food from the low ground
along the river, so that it was neces
sary to move to a better location. ;.

but on ' December 6 the longed-for permis
sion was obtained, and thereafter letters
passed between husband and wife dally,
and sometimes almost hourly, until he
was removed- to Devils Island. The let
ters published .in this volume cover the
period from December 5, 1594, to March 5,
1898. .
It goes without saying that the entire
correspondence should be read to appre
ciate their pathos and the hopeless trag
edy of the writer's lot. The extracts which
this article contains will give some con
ception of their general character. They
also give for. the first time an intimate
insight into the heroic soul of their
author. It will be perhaps best to begin
w_.h the second letter of the series, dated
December 5, 1894, when Dreyfus as yet
had hardly realized the danger that men
aced him.
I am waiting with Impatience for a letter
from you. You are my hope; you are my con
solation; -were It not for you life would be a
burden. At the bare thought that they could
accuse me of a crime so frightful, so mon
strous, mv whole being trembles: my body re
volts against it. To have worked all my life
â for one thing alone, to avenge my country, to
struggle for her against the infamous ravlsher
who has snatched from us our dear Alsace, and
then to be accused of treason' against that
countryâ no, my loved one, my mind refuses
to comprehend it! Do you remember my telling
you how, when I was in Mulhouse. ten years
ago. in September, I heard a German band un
der our windows celebrating the anniversary
of Sedan? My grief was such that I wept; I
hit the sheets of my bed with rage, and I
swore an oath to consecrate all my strength,
all mv intelligence, to the service of my .coun
try against those who . thus offered Insult to
the grief of Alsace. ...
No, no. I will not speak of It, for I shall go
mad.' and I must preserve all my reason. More
over my life has henceforth but one aim: to
find 'the wretch who has betrayed his country;
delegates were shown one of the com
bined reapers and- threshers worked by
means of steam. The lands that have
been reclaimed along the sides of the
river were pointed out as of especial in
terest. . . - -' 'â¢â¢ -'â  -
One of the most interesting events of
the day was an explanation by H. W.
Wiley, "chief chemist of the United States
Department of Agriculture, who a num
ber of years ago was stationed at Union
Island when the Department of Agricul
ture was operating an experiment sta
tion there upon a small scale, upon the
result of the agriculture possibilities of
the land along the river. At that time
Dr. Wiley wan experimenting with a view
of ascertaining just what kind of vege
tation the land was best suited to. and
the very products that he reported could
be raised are the ones that to-day are
the main sources of revenue to the farm
era of the section. Dr. Wiley said that
the richness of the soil of the islands, as
well as the land along the river. Is such
that It is capable of producing anything.
He said that rice can be successfully
raised in this soil, and that when he was
last here he determined the fact by suc
cessful experiments.
Professor Wickson of the university,
who is familiar with this country, also
explained many of its wonderful possi
bilities. The visitors spent the entire day
upon the boat. They were accompanied
by J. A. Filcher, secretary of the State
Board of Trade, who joined them several
days ago and will continue with them
until the inspection of the State is com
pleted. - _ - -_ .; : '-j:;..
WARRANT FOR ARREST
OF LEON M. STRAUSS
Former San Jose Attorney Charged
With Ferjury by W. S.
Allen.
SAN JOSE, July 13.â A warrant was
sworn to before Justice Wallace to-day
charging Leon M. Strauss, until j re
cently an attorney in this city, with
perjury. The. complainant is Waldo S.
Allen, who had some business dealings
with Strauss. During the month of
January Sylvia Allen, wife of the com
plainant, filed a suit for divorce from
her husband and engaged Strauss as
her . attorney. The differences were
patched- up and .'".the suit .dismissed,
Allen agreeing to turn over his .prop
erty an-l money, amounting to about
$1100.
The transferring of this was left to
Strauss, and it is alleged that when
the settlement was completed the bank
account was $400 short. Strauss' ex
planation was that he took the money
as a fee, and Allen and wife were in
luck that he did not take $500. Strauss
was subsequently sued by the Aliens
for $299. On supplementary proceed
ings he declared under oath that he had
no money or property due him. Allen
afterward unearthed a receipt given by
Strauss for some $60 that was due him
at that time. Strauss is how in San
Francisco, where it is said he Is taking
minor parts on the stage at the Alca
zar. A warrant for his arrest was for
warded there.

SANTA BARBARA. July 13.â Yda Addis

Storke Jackson was examined this morning
assault to commit murder. The court
room was crowded, but the sensational
evidence expected did not occur. Y'da
Addis was accompanied by Officer Hop
kins, who brought her down from the"
County Jail, and when they entered the
courtroom she acted as though in great
pain and had to be assisted by the officer
whenever she wanted .to move. When
asked if she had procured the necessary
counsel she stated that It. was an impos
sibility, as she had no funds and no one
would. defend her. , - ;.v
Attorney Grant Jackson; the complain
ing witness, was the first called. He re
lated his story in a short and well defined
manner.' E. C. TallaÂ«t and Officer Shoup,
who arrested the woman, were placed on
the stand. Their testimony was very
similar to that of Jackson, The defendant
did not question either. The last
witness was William Carter, who had
awakened Mr. Talent, but he knew very
little of the circumstances. Mrs. Storke
was asked if she had any remarks to
make, to which she stated that she had
. not. She was held to answer before the
Superior Court and her bonds were placed
at $5000. ' . 'k'A . .

to find the traitor for whom no punishment
could be too severe. Oh, dear France, thou
that I love with all my soul, with all my
heart! Thou to whom I have consecrated all
my strength, all my intelligence, - how could
one accuse me of a crime so horrible! I will
not write upon this subject, my darling; tor
spasms take me by the. throat. No man has
ever borne the martyrdom that I endure. No
physical suffering can be compared to the men
tal agony that I feel when my thoughts turn
to this accusation. If I had not my honor to
defend. I assure you that I should prefer
death: at least, death would be forgetfulness.
Write to me soon. My love to all. ALFRED.
From the letter written on the day pre
ceding his trial it is seen that he was
still, after two months' imprisonment,
sanguine and hopeful, with never a doubt
about his ultimate acquittal. It is in
striking contrast to the letter written
after the trial, when the worst had hap
pened and the nightmare had come true.
Both letters are appended:
At last I am coming to the end of my suffer
ings, to the end of my agony. To-morow I shall
appear before my Judges, my brow high, my
soul tranquil. The trial I have undergone, ter
rible as it has been, has purified my soul. I
shall return to you better than I was before.
I want to consecrate to you, to my children, to
our dear families, all the time I have yet to |
live. ... â¢ - . â¢
As I have told you, I have passed through
awful crises. I have had moments of furious,
actual madness at the thought of being ac
cused of a crime so monstrous.
I am ready to appear before the soldiers as a
soldier who has nothing for which to reproach I
himself. They will see it in my face; they will I
read my. soul; they will be convinced that I am I
innocent; as all will who know me. ,
The letter written after his trial reads
as follows:
I suffer much, but I pity you still more than j
myself. I know how much you love me. Your |
heart must bleed. On my side, my adored one, j
my thought has always been of you night and ;
day.
To be innocent, to have lived a life without a
stain, and to see one's self condemned for the
most monstrous crime that a soldier can com
mit! What could be more terrible? It seems to i
me at times that I am the victim of an awful :
nightmare. It is for you alone that I have re
sisted until to-day: it is for you alone, my j
adored one, that I have borne my long agony. |
Will my strength hold out to the end? I can- â¢
not tell. No one but you can give me courage, j
It is only from your love that I can draw It.
Above all else, no matter what may become
of me, search for the truth; move earth and i
heaven to discover It; sink In the effort, if
need be, all our fortune to rehabilitate my j
name, which now is dragged through the mud. '
No matter what may be the cost, we must wash j
out the unmerited stain. ; -
After his fate was sealed and he had
been removed to Devils Island, his deter
mination that the truth shall be brought
to light is stronger than ever.
In conclusion, if there existed the slight
est doubt of Alfred. Dreyfus' innocence,
the publication of these letters cannot
fail to dispel it. As Zola says, "No guilty
man could have written them."

CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELL
INGTON HOTEL, WASHINGTON,
July 13.â 1t is altogether probable that
the next annual report of the Internal
Revenue Bureau will recommend a ;
number of changes in the war revenue t
act. The internal revenue officials are
of the opinion that the law might prop
! erly be extended in certain directions
! without becoming at all burdensome to
I the public, and in a way to produce
j considerable revenue. One of the propo- '<
| sitions now under consideration i.s to |
j assess a tax on the sale or rental of all \
I patent protected articles. In speaking
! of the matter to-day, one of the officials
i spoke of the telephone companies in ;
j this connection, and at the same time '
j said that there were many inventions
j producing an enormous profit which
i could well stand a revenue tax.
It probably will be suggested to Con
; gress that' express and telegraph com- ,
' panics doing a money exchange busi
â  ness be required to pay an annual tax
j for the privileges. Although taxes are
! now paid on receipts and telegrams re- j
! spectively, it is pointed out that bank- j
! ers are required to pay a yearly tax I
of $50, which is regarded as a discrimi- I
i nation against them. It is probable !
I that each express and telegraph office
I In towns having over a certain popula
tion, if the views of the treasury offi
cials are approved by Congress, will be
required to pay a certain yearly, tax
for the privilege of doing an exchange
business. It is also likely that a modi--!
fication of the law with respect to mu
j tual Insurance companies may be
raised. In the present act there is con
siderable obscurity with respect to the
provisions as to these companies, both
fire and life. It is pointed out that a
number of the leading companies in the
country are operated upon the mutual
plan. Some of these are paying the. tax
without protest, but there is doubt as
to their liability in this respect. It is
believed, however, that Congress clear
! ly intended to make the exemption ap
| ply to local companies doing a strictly
I local business, without surplus or un
j divided profits or money at their com
j mand with which to pay large salaries
to their officers.
Section 20 of the war revenue act. ;
defining what should be taxed under
Schedule B, has been a source of much
trouble to the Internal Revenue offi
cers. For instance, the whole group of
coal tar extracts have- been decided by
the courts to be not subject to the tax. j
A pound of phenacetine costs in Can
ada, it is said, from 12 to 15 cents and
yet in the United States the -price is j
uniformly a dollar a pound.. This drug, ;
it is thought, could well stand a heavy
tax. â¢'â :\ â  '_â¢ 'â :*'â  â¢â¢ " ' '.'. .' Â,. - :". . "
There are several items in the old :
Internal revenue laws which it is be- â¢
lieved should be eliminated or modified,
and it Is not improbable that Congress j
will be asked to appoint an expert com
mission to thoroughly go over the
ground and recommend such changes in
detail as experience has -shown to be
necessary. Under the present law spir
its can only be sold in packages of cer
tain specific capacity. The Canadian
Government, it is said, takes advantage
of this restriction and prohibits the im
portation Into . that country of spirits
except in packages of an unusual size.
The result is that American distillers
are compelled to ask authority to ship
their goods in packages to comply with
the Canadian requirements, thus de
stroying all marks and other evidences
of age that are of value to them.
FATHER LAGAN HONORED.
Given a Reception and Presented
With a Handsome Purse.
SAN RAFAEL, July 13.â The promo
tion of Rev. Hugh Lagan to the pas
torate of the Sacred Heart parish was
made the occasion of a public reception
at the Hall Rafael last night, where the
popular priest was given an ovation by
a large concourse of people, irrespective
of sect or creed. The hall was deco
rated, with American flags and the
stage embowered in evergreens.
Dr. W. J. Wickman officiated as
chairman and on the platform were
seated the following persons, of whom
the first eight formed the committee
signing the resolutions: James H. Wil
kins, A. W. Foster, Judge F. M. Angel
lotti, E. W. McCarthy, Richard Kin
sella, William Caesar, Christopher
Chrisholm, Dr. Wickman, Charles
Bogan, Rev. Father Lagan, John F.
Boyd, Judge M. C. Dufficy, J. J. Crow
ley, Rev. Fathers Egan, Sheehy and
Valentine, E. B. Martinelli and William
Barr. N '
Ex-Mayor E. W. McCarthy spoke in
high terms of Father Lagan's work
among the unfortunates at San Quentln
Prison, and in conclusion presented him
with a draft for $800, which sum Was
raised by popular subscription. He was
asked to accept it not as a gift, but as
a material token of the unbounded es
teem in which he is held.

a voice husky with emotion Father

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, July 13.â The State Lun
acy Commission completed its investi
gation into Mrs. Chaffers' condition at
Agnews Asylum this afternoon and ad
journed subject to the call of Governor
Gage. No finding was reached. [_
The testimony to-day was along the
same linens as that of yesterday. it
fixed the responsibility on Cooper.
As far as the Chaffers matter
was concerned the investigation was
thorough and complete. There were
practically no new developments.
It was shown, however, that the
asylum has been conducted in a lax
manner. Cooper had keys to the female
wards and the daily reports at the in
stitution had been laid around pro
miscuously. Some of these, of about,
the time the offense was committed,
were missing. Rose Ryan, an attend
ant in ward. D, was the first witness.
She saw Cooper assist Mrs. Chaffers
out of a basement window. Patients
had told her they a.su saw Cooper pass
out other patients. Witness had seen
Cooper standing in the basement win
dow talking to patients.
Supervisor H. A. Braden had on. sev
eral occasions found keys to the female
ward on Cooper. Those keys belonged
to Underwood, the basement man, un
der whose direction Cooper worked. He
had also found Cooper on the stairway
leading to the female ward.
Walter H. Davis, third assistant cook,
testified that Cooper frequently boasted
to him of his conquests. Cooper had
intimated that he was responsible for
Mrs. Chaffers' condition and under obli
gations to marry her, but their condi
tions would not allow such a thing.
Frank Logue, the fuel man, produced
a letter he had received accusing him
of having been in a compromising posi
tion with Mrs. Chaffers. The letter was
anonymous. He denied this charge and
his explanation was accepted.
It afterward developed that Cooper
had written the letter because of an
I imaginary jealousy against Logue.
Matron Bambauer was recalled, and
questioned regarding some missing re
ports. After the investigation had ad-
I journed the reports' were found. Medi
| cal Director Sponogle and Dr. Christal
I were further examined. Much contra
-1 dictory evidence was elicited as to when
the offense was reported to Sponogle. ,
Elijuhe Cooper was the last witness
examined. He is a patient at the insti
tution and about 60 years of age. He
said he had seen Logue with Mrs. Chaf
fers on various occasions. He, denied
the charges made against him and as-
serted his innocence. This completed
the Investigation. -
A short executive, session was held
and it was decided to close the testi
mony. An adjournment wis then taken
subject to the.call of the Governor,.'"--/
All the officials in attendance at the
investigation- left for San Francisco on
the evening train.

Â£ Teachers themselves, concede that the formation of
Â£ character is the most important feature of education. This
Â£ is especially true where government is brought close to the
_Â£ people. That the welfare of the individual and of society de
Â£ pends upon an enlightened public conscience we have no
Â£ less an authority than Washington himself. He declares in
Â£ his farewell address that public and private welfare depend
i not upon extent of territory, its fertility or its climate, upon
i trade, commerce, large armies or mighty navies, nor upon
J universal and refined education, but upon a simple, silent
Â£ principle of the soul, namely, a religious conscience.
5 Our relations are regulated by law. Law is made and
Â£ executed by legislators and judges taken from the people.
1 The purpose of legislator and judge ought to be to mete
J out equal justice to all men. The only guarantee that they
J will do so is their conscientious convictions. If these con
-2 victions are not stronger than the temptations to betray
2 their trust they will betray it.
Â£ To form this conscience in the individual, and through
2 the individual to build up a public conscience, man must be
Â£. taught to make conscience paramount to every other char
Â£ acteristic.
Â£ Man is a complex being, physical, intellectual and
Â£ moral, and education, to be perfect, must develop his whole

LOS ANGELES. July 13.â The feature
of the National' Educational Associa
tion sessions to-day was the election
of officers for the ensuing year. C. T.
Corson, formerly Superintendent of Pub
lic Instruction of the Buckeye State, was
chosen to preside over the destiny of the
association . for the next twelve months.
Los Angeles was honored by the election
of Professor J. A. Foshay. City Superin
tendent of Schools, as one of the vice

"If there be no objections to the re
port of the nominating committee as read
the secretary is instructed to cast one
vote for these names," said President ___.
Oram Lyte at noon to-day at the annual
meeting of the active members ot the
National Educational Association in Haz
ard*. Pavilion.
There was a second's pause, and, as
no objections were forthcoming, tne men
that nad been placed in nomination by
the nominating committee last evening
were declared elected without a ballot.
"Whatever politics had been played in
this matter had been kept wholly within
the limits of the nominating committee
that prepared the ticket.
Ex-President Lyte introduced Presiden.
Corson as a native of the Buckeye State
and described him as a man big in body
and big in heart. Â
â¢'I do not propose to make a speech,
said President Corson. "1 will merely
thank you and say that I hope that we
may continue the great work of this as
sociation." . _ _ -_.
The committee which nominated Pro
fessor Corson was in session nearly two
hours last evening. The other two can
didates for the ], residency were Profes
tor J. A. Foshay, City Superintendent of
Los Angeles Public Schools, and Profes
sor L. D. Harvey, Principal of the State
Normal School of Wisconsin. Under the
rules of the association, the past presi
dent, E. O. Eyte, now becomes first vice

After the preliminary exercises. Right
Rev. George Montgomery, Catholic-Bishop
of this diocese, delivered one â¢><.' tbe most
I interesting addresses of the entire session.
His subject was -"l": Religious Element
i in the Formation <â¢:' Character," and it
I was treated with all the eloquent force
j fulness for which this eminent Bishop is
noted.
Prof. G. "W. A. Luckey, University of Ne
braska, next read a paper on "The Devel
opment of Moral Character," in which he
indorsed in part the Aristotlean adage
that "The state should begin the educa
tion of the children before the marriage
of their parents." He believed that com
mon sense in selecting life companions,
proper cultivation of mind and heart, con
feniality of home surroundings and care
ul observation of the laws of health all
tend to strengthen the character of the
offspring. "No one ever dreamed himself
into a noble character," said the speaker,
"but character is active and not passive.
but by patient and untiring effort In- may
make of himself what he will and remain
secure in the face of danger and storm.
Would you overcome a fault substitute a
higher activity in its place and guard
well that there be no reversion until the
new has firmly taken the place of the
old."
The next paper submitted was on "Evo
lution and Ethics," and was read by Pro
fessor S. T. Skidmore, Normal School,
Philadelphia. Practical ethics is largely
concerned in the problem of evil, and the
elimination of evil from the world, and
the speaker urged that its peculiar mis
sion is to set forth the latest, best and
most saving gifts of intelligence to the
world.
"The Scholar and the State" was the
title of the address delivered by Professor
R. H. Webster, City Superintendent of
Schools of San Francisco, in which he
held that there never was an age that
called so solemnly for teachers of right
thought, noble purpose and wise and
temperate opinion.
Professor R. B. Fulton, president of the
University of Mississippi,' read a paper on
"The Growth of Confidence Between
High Schools and Colleges"; Mrs. J. J.
Hermans, Kansas City, one on "The
Spirit of the Classics," and Professor F.
i J. Barnard, Seattle, Wash., one on "The
Proper Classification of Pupils."
At the evning session Dr. F. Louis Sol
dan. Superintendent of Schools. St. Louis,
addressed the convention on the subject
of "Progress in Public Education."
Dr. N. Murray Butler, Columbia Uni
versity. New York, followed with an in
teresting paper on "The Outlook in Edu
cation," and the session was closed by G.
R. Glenn, State Superintendent of Public
Instruction, Georgia, taking as his text
for a more than ordinarily interesting ad
dress "Some Phases of Public Education
: in the South."

LOS ANGELES, July 13.â One of the
most interesting addresses of the day "'.is
delivered in the kindergarten section by
THE SAN FRANCISCO CAM,, FRIDAY, JULY 14, 1899.
How the Mental, Physical and
Moral Natures of Citizens
Are Developed
Professor E. E. Brown of Berkeley on
the subject of "Naughty Children." He
said in part:
Happy is the lot of those children who have
learned to know and love the old. English bal
lads, the aid Scotch melodies, Landseer's dogs
and Rosa Bonheur's sheep and horses; the tale
of Troy. and. better yet, stories of the Old and
New Testament and the nobler hymns of the
church. Their childhood has given them treas
ures which they will only value the more when
their power of appreciation shall be enlarged
and refined. â¢;..â¢ Â r . .
It is not desirable that a schoolroom should
be so decorated as to seem like fairy-land
when the child first enters it. Better that he
should not find it bewilderingly enchanting.
Quiet in coloring, not too great a multiplicity
of things in sight, no matter how good each
may be in itself- a few carefully chosen pic
turesânothing crowded,- nothing hurried, noth
ing overwrought.' Let him find in the school
room thing:- which grow upon him as he con
tinues to live with them. Do not let the effect
of wholesome surroundings be neutralized by
a different spirit In the dally instruction. Let
there be no singing of cheap and catchy songs,
or, worse vet. of excessively emotional melo
dies. Let there be no straining after elaborate
grace or gesture, or undue expressiveness in
reading. Let there be no honeyed sweetness
in the intercourse of the teacher with the
pupils. If art is to have any place at all In
our scheme of education, let it have oppor
tunity of teaching its own proper lessonsâles
sons cf quietness and confidence, of harmony,
of proportion, of clear-grained truthfulness.
COLLEGE EJ_TRJIJK-E
REQUIRE.ME.NTS
LOS ANGELES, July 13.â depart
ment of higher education held Its meet
ing to-day in conjunction with the depart
ment of secondary education.
The committee appointed at Denver in
1595 to prepare a report on I college en
trance requirements presented, through
Dr. A. F. Nightingale, Superintendent of
High Schools, Chicago, its report as
follows:
The committee on college entrance require
ments submitted their report. The committee
was appointed to study the question of col
lege entrance requirements, for the purpose of
harmonizing the relations between the second
ary schools and the colleges, "to the end that
the former may do their legitimate work, as the
schools of the people, and at the same time
furnish an adequate preparation to the pupils
for more advanced study in the academic col
leges and technical schools of the country."
The committee stated: "The study of the Eng
lish language and its literature Is inferior in
importance to no study in the curriculum. It
offers all, or nearly all, the opportunities for
mental training afforded by the study of any
language, and introduces the pupil to the lit
erature of his own tongue, which must al
ways be the true source of his own thought,
inspirations. Ideals and esthetic enjoyment,
and must also be the vehicle of his communi
cation with his fellow men. Hence this study
should be placed ln a position at least not In
ferior to that allotted other languages."
They expressed approval of. the following
principles:
1. .That there should be no difference between
the regular courses and the college preparatory
courses ln English in secondary schools;
2. That the college requirement in English
should be distributed through the four years.
The committee also recommended that four
periods per week for four years be allotted to
the work in English, and that at least one-half
of this time be devoted to the department of
literature.
The following resolutions adopted by the com
mittee put in concrete form the leading prin
ciples which guided it and which, in the com
mittee's judgment, were to be considered as
first principles In the adjustment of relations
between the secondary and higher schools:
Resolved, That the principle of election be
recognized in secondary schools.
Resolved, That the requirements for admis
sion to technical schools should be as extended
and thoroush as the requirements for admis
sion to college.
Resolved, That the teachers in the secondary
schools should lie college graduates, or have
an equivalent of a college education.
Resolved, That we favor a unified six-year
high school course of study, beginning with the
Seventh grade.
Resolved, That while the committee recog
nizes the principle of large liberty to the stu
dent in secondary schools, It does not believe
in unlimited election, but especially emphasizes
the importance of a certain number of con
stants in all secondary schools and in all re
quirements for admission to college.
Resolved, That the committee recommend
that the number of constants be recognised In
the following proportion, namely:
Four units In foreign languages (no lan
guage accepted in less than two units), two
units in mathematics, .two in English, one ln
history and cue In science.
Resolved, That the colleges will aid the
secondary schools by allowing credit toward a
,;oif r ,-.p (or work done In secondary schools, be
yond the amount required for entrance, when
equal in amount and thoroughness to work done
in the same subjects in college. \
Resolved. That for students who have met a
definite requirement In any science, and who
continue the subject In college, it sÂ«-ems to us
desirable that there be provided a suitable
sequel to the school course ln continuation of
tbe study, sue*-, students being in no case
placed In the some clpns with beginners.
Resolved. That we approve of encouraging
lifted students to complete the preparatory
course in less time than Is required by most
students. â¢
Resolved, That In general we recognize in
schools the admissibility of a second year in
advance work in the same subject. Instead of
a second year In a' related subject;- for exam
ple, two years In biology, instead of one year
in biology and one year in chemistry, where
local conditions favor such an arrangement.
Resolved, That it is desirable that colleges
should accept, in addition to the year of United
States history and civil government, at least
half a year of Intensive study of some period
of history, especially of the United States.
Resolved, That It Is desirable that our col
leges and universities should accept as a unit
for admission a year's work in economics, in
cluding under this head a course in elementary
political economy, supplemented by adequate
Instruction in commercial geography and Indus
trial history.
Resolved, That we recommend an Increase
In the school day In secondary schools to per
mit a larger amount of study In school under
supervision.
In connection with courses of study sub
mitted, the committee said:
The opinion is held by good thinkers that we
are living ln an age of excessive individualism.
It is certainly true that the educational system
of the country has suffered, and still suffers,
from the great opportunity afforded by our
system for the play of individual idiosyncrasies.
It it; quite true, on the other hand, that educa
tion, as a whole, has gained vastly from the
freedom offered to individuals Initiative, but
on certain measures of national bearing the
time has come to subordinate some personal
preferences in order to reach an agreement
which shall make for the public good. Such
an agreement does not mean the abandonment
or sacrifice of a principle, but it may involve
the non-insistence on carrying the principle
into immediate practice. The committee dis
tinctly refrains from entering upon the task
of constructing currlculums to be imposed, for
the sake of uniformity, upon the schools of the
country'- Such uniformity is not needed; but
uniformity in courses of study which shall lead
to the establishment of national units, or
norms, does seem to be of so great importance
that both colleges and secondary schools may
fairly be expected to yield, to a large extent,
individual opinions which interfere with its
establishment. While the committee is unani
mous in this opinion, it feels that the opinion
would still be of little value but for the fact
that in the course of four years' work upon
this problem it has become convinced that
there is a widespread sentiment among thought
ful educators of the country which demands
such action. In formulating these courses of
study, these units, or norms, and presenting
them to the public, the committee does not,
therefore, feel that it is leading the way into
a new and untried field, ' making suggestions
which may come to fdultion in after years, but
that it is formulating, crystallizing, putting
Into definite shape beliefs and sentiments that
have already taken hold upon the educational
public. Legislation is largely the official recog
nition of existing facts or sentiment. The com
mittee in this work feels that it Is acting more
ln a legislative than in a pioneer capacity.
What relation commercial studies shall have
to other studies in the programme, and whether
any commercial studies, such as history of in
dustries, history of commerce and commercial
geography, should be recognized for admission
for college, are questions which will soon have
immediate practical importance. The whole sub
ject of commercial education in secondary
schools seems to the committee one deserving
3 â 
f
of special study, one, indeed, for the considera
tion of which a special committee might well
be appointed. . _
The document was somewhat intricate,
and in the discussion that followed the
following educators took part: President
Joseph Swain of Indiana University;
President David Starr Jordan, Stanford
University; President R. H. Jesse of the
University of Missouri; A. J. Smith. Su
perintendent of Schools. St. Paul, Minn.;
Frank Morton, principal of the Lowell
High School, San Francisco, and others.
EXODUS OF TJJE
TEACHERS BEGLNS
LOS ANGELES, July 13.â The exodus
from Los Angeles is on, and the next few
days will see almost as big a scramble in
and about the railroad offices as was wit
nessed when the army of passengers ar
rived here from the East late last week
and early the present one. Every berth
on to-night's Owl was taken before i>:3o
this morning, and the applicants for Pull

knee deep in the Southern Pacific's city
ticket office all day. Nearly all of the
visitors who came via the Santa Fe will
return by one of the northern routes.
I The party of New York teachers which

! left to-night for Portland. The visitors
have their own train of three cars. The
Gillespie party goes to Monterey to-night
in two cars. A special party of Boston
people, consisting of 16S passengers, will
leave here to-morrow for the north."
To-day was San Francisco day at tho
California headquarters at the Van Nuys.
EDUCATION'S TRIUMPH
Â£ The progress of public education, as far as external J
{, growth is concerned, has been stupendous during the last J
k fifty years. The national investment in school houses and $
Â£. property needed for the conduct of schools is enormous and Â£
C is increasing with every moment. The same progress is no- *
Â£ ticeable in the development of higher education. The Euro- Â£
{_ pean standards of university appointments have not only been J
Â£ reached but surpassed. Fast as the material and external Â£
t progress is which has been made in public education the in- J
Â£ ternal progress in instruction and school management has Â£
{I more than kept pace with it. There are two currents which *
{. all popular education has to consider. One is the very neces- Â£
Â£ sary adjustment of education to the practical demands of life *
Â£ and to the march of history which carries a people along to J
* new destinies. Public education must prepare the future *
* citizen to take his place in the new world of state and so- Â£

To-morrow Stockton delegates will be in
charge.
The rush for tickets to see the Chinese
theatrical performance is very great. As
teachers are being complimented by the
entertainment committee at no cost they
are admonished to apply early for tick
ets. The troupe will arrive on Saturday
and will parade through the city escorted
by a delegation of prominent local China
men.
Visiting teachers are taking every op
portunity to view the adjacent places of
inter- st. This morning four carloads went
to Mount Lowe and four tally-ho parties
visited San Gabriel and Pasadena. Over
200 went to Redondo to enjoy the bathing
and fishing. The Terminal Railroad
carried several hundred to the Terminal
Island and Long ['.each. The people of
Long Beach are keeping open house and
welcome the teachers with hospitality.
A party of ISO was taken over the kite
shaped track by the Santa Fe. The party
visited Redlands, enjoyed the beauties of
Smiley Heights and was dined at the
Casa Loma. Later two. hours were passed
in viewing the orange groves at Riverside.
Up to noon to-day the joint ticket office
of the general headquarters had stamped
7000 tickets, and the railroad agents esti
mated that about 7000 more were still un
stamped. This would make a sale of
14,000 tickets, including Eastern and local
tickets, disposed of by railroads. The
local tickets comprise those that were sold
west of El Paso and Albuquerque and
) south of Portland.
Mrs. Hopkins, who has had the experi
ence of five previous meetings of the
National Educational Association, to-day
said that so far 10,000 memberships had
been issued and that at least 2500 would
follow before the close of the season.
Taking these two official figures of stamp
ing tickets and of issuing memberships
as a basis of calculation, the total at
tendance in Los Angeles for this National
Educational Association session will fall
below 15.000, but will exceed the Denver
meeting by several thousand, as the capi
tal of the Centennial State entertained at
the session of 1897 a little over 11,000 dele
gates.
The delegates from among the Chicago
teachers, who are all members of the Chi
cago Teachers' Federation, held a session
this afternoon, the meeting lasting from
2 o'clock until 3:30 p. m. The meeting was
called for the purpose of taking steps to
ward the formation of a national teach
ers' federation on the lines of the Chicago
organization. President Catherine Gog
gin of the Chicago Federation was elected
chairman to serve until a permanent or
ganization is effected, and Miss Margaret
Haley was elected secretary to serve for
the same time".
R. C. Baner, the national supervisor of
Indian schools, said to-day: "I consider
this, gathering of Indian instructors the
greatest success we have ever. had, and a
great compliment to Miss Estelle Reel's
astuteness in selecting Los Angeles as the
place for our meeting." In speaking of
the Indian outlook Ihe said: "The out
look with regard to Indians is that in a
very short time there will ,be no Indians
in the usual sense of the wtird, for all will
be patriotic American citizens. The girls
will make civilized homes for the boys,
and the boys will be ready to carry the
muskets behind the stars and the stripes."
To-morrow will wind up the business of
the regular session. The evening general
session will include an address on "The
Usefulness of the University," by David
Starr Jordan, president of Leland Stan
ford Junior University.

LOS ANGELES, July 13.â The city of
Charleston, S. C. one of the galaxy of
bright Southern cities, is the choice of a
large majority of the teachers now here as
the place for holding the next annual
convention of the National Educational
Association. That fact was demonstrated
at the meeting of the new board of direc
tors held at the Chamber of Commerce to
night. Including Charleston the . cities
that contested for the meeting were Bos
ton, Cincinnati and Montreal. The claims
of each were ably presented, the balloting
being watched with intense interest, lhe
result showed Charleston to have more
votes than all competitors combined, 'that
city led in the contest with 23 directors in
its favor, Boston coming next with 11
votes, and Cincinnati had 3 votes and
Montreal 1. Asbury Park. N. J., and Sara
toga, N. V., did not. contrary expecta
tions^ have their claims presented. Dele
gations from both places have been .-.ere
hard at work, making claims of each and
distributing vast quantities of literature
setting forth the advantages of both
places. It was. however, discovered at
the last moment that neither city was in
it. so far as the present feeling is con
cerned, and it was therefore not thought
wise to enter either place. The South
Carolina delegation is to-night celebrat
ing its victory, which may, however, after
all prove barren of any real results, tor
the reason that to-night's choice is not
final, being only in the nature of a feeler.
The executive committee will not meet
to choose a convention city until late in
the year.

NEW YORK, Juiy 12.â The Tribune
to-morrow v. ill say; A business alliance
of American and English capitalists ha_
betn recently formed which is of un
usual interest and importance, because
of the leading poeitiooa held by th.se
men on both sides of the Atlantic; be
cause of the many millions of dollars
involved in it; because the United.
States Government is ab&at to be asked
to give the compact ofhc.a: sanction and
moral .support; because England has al- ; ;
ready formally approved it, and be
cause the field of its <j_._rat.or.e ds be
yond the jurisdiction of both nations.
Announcement of this alliance was
made yesterday by F. V.'. V.'hit ridge of
the firm of Gary -t Wfaatridge, who ..ow
hlis the place left vacant by the death
of ex-Senator Calvin S. Brice as chair- i
man of the executive committee of the
American-China Development Com-,
pacy. The company is one party to the
agreement and tbe other is the British- i
Chinese Corporation This makes a
combination of the most povrerfol capi- ;
tailsts in the world, and the field of
their activity is China. â¢ *
The concessions which ex-Senator
Brice feecured from the Chinese Govern- ;
ment for the American-China Develop,
ment Com; ar.y consist of the right to
construct a railroad 7Â£K> miles long from
Canton to Hankow, exceedingly vaiu
table coal mining concessions and other
industrial franchises of less individual,;
but great aggregate, vaiue.
ThÂ«^ British company has a contract
to build an eighty-mile railway from j
Canton to Kowloon on the sea coast.
Tbe two resolved to poo! their under
taking and their profit. The British ;
company apparently got the better of
the bargain, but their ability to sell
Chinese bonds in the money markets of
Europe exceeded the ability of the
American company to sell Chinese
bonds in America, or anywhere else, to ]
feuch an extent that the advantage is j
only- apparent.
The American company's engineer,
W. Barclay Parsons of this city, has
completed the survey of the railway
line from Hankow to Canton and an
agent of the syndicate is now in Shang- â :
hai. He reported that the -negotiations j
ut Peking have reached a critical stage
and there Is a disposition on the part i
of the Chinese Government, repre- I
sented by Hheng Tagen, director of
railways, to avoid fulfilling dta part of*]
the contract. This is the cause of their |
appealing .o our Government for moral
support. j
Mr. Whitridge asserts that Lord
Rosebery has already instructed the
British Embassador in China to treat 'â 
the contract secured by the American I
company and shared with the English j
company as if it were a British con- j
tract, and to urge the Chinese Govern- j
.cent to fulfill its terms. The American ;
company sent Mr. Parsons to \Vashing
ton yesterday to make a formal request
that the Government of the United
State- take a similar stand. Such a
demand upon the United States Gov- ]
eminent is probably unprecedented

Sleeping-
CAN' RAFAEL. July 25.â Thomas Green, a brake
man employed by the California Northwestern Rail
way Company, declares that the physicians and ento
mologists may deliver their die-turns as they please â
he was bitten by a kissing bug. The appearance of
the brakeman demonstrate* pretty clearly that he
was stung by some poisonous insect, as his lace
has beer, so badly swollen that for three days he
wa; blind ar.d had to be led home the cay after
he was attacked by what he is certain was the kiss
ing- bug. i.iss Mamie Joseph, a niece of ex-Sheriff
Harrison, wÂ£t also stuns by an Insect, ar.d suf
fered severely for three days. The news of these
occurrer.ces has obtained general circulation, with
the result that the timid are terrorized and
nightly bar their windows tightly at the risk of pay
ing the penalty for the violation of a hygienic taw. THOMAS CREEK.
Last Friday night, while Green was asleep at Petaluma, he was
stung by ar. insert. Ke has a dim recollection of a bug of Borate kind
alighting on bis lip whiie he wa*- dozing. He brushed it away and was
soon soundly eAf-^pinfr. The next morning he looked In a mirror and
noticed a slight puncture Id the lower lip, which was slightly swollen.
In a_n hour his face had swollen so badly that his eyes were closed. A
physician was summoned bo told Green that he had been poisoned
by the sting of some insect. On Saturday afternoon the brakeman
came borne. He was unable to see, and when led to the home of his
father, John Green, presented such a plight that his parents were
alarmed and sent to a pharmacy for medicine. For four days Green
Buffered a good deal of pain, but on Tuesday last the inflammation be-
Kan to subside and yesterday the brakernan was able to return to
work.
Miss Joseph was stung on the left side of the nose while asleep and
the left FiZz of her face became mflamed and swollen, while she was
continually annoyed by shooting pains. No physician was summoned
in her case, arid she has now almost recovered from the effects of her
injury. She doesn't know whether or not the kissing bug is responsi
ble, but she Intends to give "the beast no more chances to cause her
any inconvenience."

CHICAGO. July 13.â play in the
Western championship tennis tourna
ment closed to-day with a quarrel. A
postponement on account of rain of the
semi-final round of doubles, which is
one of the most important matches of
the week, called forth complaints from
players and spectators, and may cause
I a rupture in the tournament. Sectional
| feeling entered into the matter, and as
| the decision favored Western men the
j Impartiality of the tournament officials
; was brought Into question.
'â  Two matches in doubles -were but
I fairly started when a drizzling rain set
lin which grew .... as the play pro
! greased. Two sets were played in the
; wet, both going to the Eastern team.
j When the fourth set was called Referee
â¢ M'.Lellan called a halt and aimed that
j the courts were ln no condition to play.
j With the chances in their favor for win
; ning, the Eastern players entered a
i vigorous protest, claiming the courts
were no worse than when the previous
j sets were played and demanded that the
j match be finished.
It took half an hour to finally decide
â¢ the matter. The rain continued during
! that time and sustained the referee in
I his decision. Hackett and Allen ac
j cused the local management of stop
's ping the match to save the Western
â¢ men, who were decidedly off in their
| game after the rain started. Results:
Semi-final doublesâ Hackett and Al-
I Jen against Bond and Collins, 4â6, 6 â -.,

EMMETT DONAHUE MAY ,
SUE FOR DIVORCE
The Ukiah Society Belle Too Fond of
the Companionship of Young
Harold Hart.
UKIAH, July 13.â When the newÃ be
came commonly disseminated that Em
mett Donahue, a prominent citizen of this
' community, had been forced to separate
I from his wife on. account of her alleged
! infatuation for a son of J. H. Hart, the
j local Western Union operator and agent
I for Wells-Fargo, a sensation was created
j and the affair Is now the common talk of
j the town. Not only is Mrs. Donahue a
| beautiful woman, but the position she
| held as a society belle was not resigned
I after her marriage and she has always
\ been the center of attraction at every
! leading social event.
| Emmett Donahue, who is the son of cx
i Sheriff Jerry Donahue, is one of the mem
bers of a firm handling abstracts of rec
ords, and has always enjoyed an irre
proachable reputation. He was married
about eight years ago to Emma Man
kins, whose father at one time owned a
great deal of land in the northern part of
town. Their union was blessed -by the
birth of a daughter, who was named
Ruth. A few months ago Mrs. Donahue
began to show a marked preference for
Harold Hart, who is several years her
| junior, and finally the tongue of scandal
; began to wag. Lgly stories came to the
husband's ears and he expostulated with
his wife, but ln vain. Things finally
reached a point where Donahue flatly told
; hie wife that her conduct must cease or
; they would have to separate. She seemed
not to care and last week the husband
deeded her their residence and presented
her with HMO in coin. Then he removed
his personal belongings and it is under
stood will sue for a divorce*.
Public sympathy seems to be with Don
ahue, even his wife's relatives declaring
that her conduct has been Inexcusable.

story regarding his relations with Miss
Anita Byrne and the time he became ae
cuainted w-ith her Is flatly contracicted by

Slo" was ill night chief operator of East
o*tce She furnishes some interesting evi
dence' concerning Seaver's record, first as
swuebboard operator and later as man-
r notic h c a m OI the c - papers." said the lady
to-i- "that Mr. Seaver says be became
r couainted with Miss Byrne when he was
manager of East office. This is -true,
F *r more than a year prior to his promo
tion to the position of manager I was
night chief operator of the office. Seaver
wis then simply a switchboard man and
flnrins all this time he was acquainted
with Miss Byrne and used to bring her to
the office while he was supposed to be at
tend In t? to his duties. If he is quoted cor
rectly in saying the relation he sustained
to her was Simply that of a brother, then
he was a brother whom no rent could
trust Many times he entered the office
with 'the girl when both were intoxicated.
Miss Adrianne Reilly. my assistant, often
used to discuss this with me and We ex
pressed sorrow for Miss Byrne, who was
deemed a model young -man before her
acquaintance witn '..,__â¢..
"Freauently he would, while drinking,
try to act familiarly with Miss Reilly and
mvÂ«elf and we both gained his enmity by
"pulsing him. the result being that when
he was promoted to the position of man
aeer he encouraged us to talk to subscrib
ers ring idle moments and then made
trouble for us with the company.
"As manager he was very arbitrary and
once forced a 'day girl' named Toohey,
who lives on Union street, near Hyde, to
work when she was ill and added several
hour' overtime because she was five min
utes late in reaching the office. Miss
Bvrne once told me that Seaver had
promised to marry her and it was doubt
less a refusal to do uo that caused her
suicide.* ! ___

The British ship City cf Tork. which
left "here on April 13 last for Fremantie.

disaster came in a short dispatchto the
Merchants* Exchange yestercay. The full
par*-c"'ar= will not be known here _ntu
the arrival cf the mail steamer from Syd
ney. X- 5. TV. - _
The City at Tork arrived here _rom ___â¢
e-poci with a eeneral cargo on January
__? and soon after was chartered by J. J-
Mocr- & Co. to lead lumber for Australia.
=he lav at the seawall and TC-fl-O feet 0..
redwood, pine and- spruce lumber. 3533
doors and US rolls of paper, ail va.ueci
at S-TdSl. were put aboard her.
There was seme trouble ever the load
iak and a lawsuit is now in progress ever
the matter. The steam schooners Aloha
I and Crescent City arrived about the same I
i time, and both had lumber for the ship. ;
! The Crescent City got alongside first, but ;
I the Aloha came along and her crew, cast- j
! ing the Crescent City off. pushed her into j
| the stream and took her place- j
| After leaving here the City of York had .
I a good run across the Pacific, and on j
I June 10 -was spoken off Goode Island. \
; From there she must have run into the
[ heavy weather that has prevailed along
! the Australian coast of late and finally ;
i piled up on Rottnest Island.
When Captain Jones and his vessel went
ashore she was only ten miles from -her
destination. Rottnest Island is near tne j
entrance to the Swan River, on which
Fremantte is built, nd had she passed
that spot all would have been well. It Is ,
considered a very dangerous locality and I
i shipmasters keep a bright lookout for the â¢
, reefs that extend out from half a mile
; to a mile from the shore. Rottnest Island :
is six miles long by two and a half miles
> broad.
"When the City cf Tcrk was ready to â¢
sail from this port she was ten men short -
iin her crew, and the following were j
! shipped before the British Consul to fill
the vacancies: O. B. Hughes, age 33,
boatswain; W. Stockwell, 25, ordinary sea
man; R. D. Mel. 25, ordinary __*__-__; >
J. Wallis, -" able seaman; S. R. Parry, I

W. Plante. -- able seaman: I- Bonner,
45, able seaman; G. WtoÂ« 56, able sea
man; M. Wortbington, 21. able seaman. j
Besides the above there were the fol
lowing who came to San Francisco on the
vessel: Philip H-. Jones, age S7, master; |
i Pape, SCt, first mate; Baxter. 25, j
second mate; John Connolly, 3D. able sea
man; F. Burk. 50. able seaman: M. Mar- |
j phy. 56. able seaman; Nicholas Termasser. i
j 30. able seaman. The City of York also j
[ carried a carpenter, maker, cook and I
I steward and thiee apprentice boys, whose i
I names cannot be ascertained here.
Third Mate Stewart did no* go out with
I the vesel. He was dying from consump- ;
ftion. so Captain Jones sent him home and !
I shipped a boatswain in his place. Second I
i Mate Baxter is the son of Captain Baxter
1 of the City of Benares, in which vesel j
Captain Jones was ahlef officer for four j
years before taking command of th- City
iof York. The other members of the crew
I were well known here. M. Murphy was
; a great favorite at the Seamen's Institute.
[He hailed from New York and had been
! all through the civil war. During his stay
; in port he gave three lectures on the art
of bandaging gunshot wounds and the
care of the sick on the battle-field and
aboard ship. Murphy has a pension com- j
Ing to him from Uncle Sam. and it was i
| his intention to put in his claim when he j
I came back to San Francisco.
i Captain Philip H. Jones was one of the j
t best liked and most courteous masters
i that came to San Francisco. He was mar- j
; ried about three years ago in Adelaide, I
' Australia, but his wife is now living in j
Coleford, Gloucestershire. England. It
was the captain's intention to give up the 1
sea after this voyage and make his home
in California. He left one child at home
with his wife, and expected to hear of
; the birth of another as soon as he arrived
â  at Fremantle.
Captain Jones was passionately fond of I
his wife, and the night before he sailed
he remained in the office of the Stewart
Menzies with F. G. Wilson until after
midnight^' in the hope that the English!
mail, which was hourly expected, would !
bring him a letter from home. He had j
been six years master of the City of York I
and never met with an accident before.
The City of York was built in 1559 by J.
Elder & Co. of Glasgow. She was lit.. 1
i tons net burden, 222 feet 7 inches long. 35 j
'' feet & Inches broad and 21 feet 7 inches

tropolis in a full dress of flagsâ and a
number of employers have signified their
intention of giving their help a half-holi
day to join in the demonstration of wel
come to the first volunteer regiment from
across the seas.
The reception has taken on an official
tone from the fad that the Supervisors,
the moment they heard the Oregonians
were to be mustered out here, adopted a
resolution to that effect, appointing a
committee of citizens to arrange for the
welcome. This committee went to work
at once and the result will be a busy
day for the men who have been so long
on the transports. After the parade they
will be allowed the afternoon to
straighten themselves out in camp. At 5
o'clock they will start on street cars for
Mechanics' Pavilion, where a dinner ar
ranged for by the committee will be set
for them. The fact that the decoration
of the pavilion and tne tables will be in
charge of the Red Cross ladies of San
Francisco will make them even mor_
beautiful for the "home again volunteer."
After the spread and the speeches the
committee will take the boys to all the
playhouses in town. The managements
of the various theaters have consented to
set apart seats in their respective houses
for the volunteers, who must be "show
hungry" by this time. With the drop

reception will terminate. â ""'''â¢-

an effort be made to induce the military
authorities to postpone the march
through the streets for a few hours . in
order that the volunteers might be given
breakfast at the ferry, but after a con
ference with General Shafter, Major No
ble and Adjutant General B. B. Tuttle
of the National Guard it was decided that
this plan was not feasible.
The committee then suggested that the
Oregon boys be allowed to return to the
city after arranging their, canrp at the
Presidio, in order that the city might ten
der them a formal reception. This plan
met with the unqualified approval of Gen
eral Shafter, and also . of Colonel Sum
mers, commanding the Oregonians. ; The
i committee adjourned to meet ln the
I Chronicle business office at 9:30 p.- m..
when the details of the reception were
arranged. " ',Â» ..-â ..
The programme provides for a recep
tion and banquet at Mechanics' Pavilion
at 6 p. m.,. after which the soldiers will
be escorted to the various theaters for
their evening's entertainment. The duty
i of providing the banquet was assigned
to Colonel A. Huber of General Dickin
son's staff, and the table decorations will
1 be furnished by the ladies of- the Red
Cross under the supervision of Mrs. W.
P. Harrington. A band of music will
1 also be in attendance to enliven the pro-
I ceedlngs with patriotic airs. The volun
teers will leave the Presidio at 5 o'clock,
' an hour before the time set for the re
ception, in order that they may have
plenty of time to reach the Pavilion. They
i will come to the city on the street cars
, and at the Pavilion will be received by a
' general reception committee of fifty citi
zens. Governor Geer will be there to
; welcome them in a brief aduress and
others will probably also be called upon
to speak.
A telegram was pent to Governor Gage
by the committee, inviting him to send a
representative to the reception in the
event of his being unable to be present,
and explaining that the tardiness of the
invitation was due to the fact that the
I committee was unable to sooner obtain
definite information as to when the
troops would land. Invitations to be
present were also sent to Major General
Shafter and staff, all the State and United
States 'officials, both civil and military.

mustered out at this point. They re
sponded with cheers and settled them
selves down to pass the hours until they
again reached firm land. They found
plenty to interest' them, particularly the
crowds of pretty girls that flocked to the
ships In launches. Along the wharves the
boys could see the crowds of people anx
ious for their coming. All the morning
and afternoon launches came and went
and along into the night and the crowds
lingered on the wharves. When the City
of Para pulled out in the evening the re
turned veterans cheered the outgoing reg
ulars and wished them luck.
The boys had notice that their boats
would be docked at 3:30 this morning, and
many of them turned in early to be up
and on the wharf at the first opportunity.
Governor Geen sent a telegram yester
day to General C. F. . Beebe, commanding
the Oregon National Guard, officially in
forming him of. the fact that the Oregon
troops would be mustered out in this city
and that the preparations now being made
for their reception in Portland would
have to be deferred. General Beebe re
plied that the decision of the' troops was
a great disappointment to their relatives,
friends and the people in general, but the
latter would not stand in the way or the
boys receiving the extra travel money by
being mustered out here, and that their
reception would be all the greater when
they did reach Oregon. v."
Adjutant General B. B. Tuttle stated
that the men. will" receive their two
months' pay on Saturday, the muster roil
now being in the hands of the paymaster.
They will remain at the Presidio for three
or four weeks until they are all paid off
and mustered out. Colonel Summers will
endeavor to take them up to Portland in
a body on a special train and they will
be paid off en route for the time con
sumed in traveling at. the rate of one
day's pay for every twenty miles. This
will mean $275 for the colonel in command,
$200 for the majors, scaling from that
down to $32 for the privates. The regi
ment will receive about $30,000 in all. and
this serves to lessen the disappointment
of the people of Oregon at not receiving
the first chance to welcome their boys.
There was a rumor to the effect tnat
the warmth of their home reception would
be reduced on account of their desire to
be mustered out here, but this is strenu
ously and indignantly denied by every
member of Governor Geer's staff. Gov
ernor Geer and his party will- leave to
morrow evening for home. They all ex
press themselves as highly pleased with
the treatment t_Â»ey have received during

PORTLAND DISAPPOINTED.
Senator Simon Thinks the Volun
teers Have Made a Mistake.
PORTLAND, July 13.â The committee
having in charge the reception which it
was proposed to give the Second Oregon
Regiment on its return here held a meet
: ing to-night and decided that, pending
: definite information regarding the place
of mustering out. no further steps. should
jbe taken. The committee : expressed re
gret that the Oregon volunteers should
have made a request to be mustered out
at San Francisco Instead of at Vancouver
' Barracks. . .- ..
United States Senator Joseph Simon, in
speaking of the desire of the regiment
to be mustered out in San Francisco, to
day; said: â  â¢ .%â¢"_â¢
"I- believe the volunteers are making a
great mistake, and I am at a loss to un
derstand their action. Not only Portland,
but the entire State will probably resent
'trfblr action. All will be disappointed.
I Personally. I am very - much disap
pointed.* In my opinion, the boys will not
': gain much in being mustered out in San
t Francisco, as 1 believe they would have
received their travel allowance just the
same had they come direct to Portland.
I had intended to take up the- matter with
the department immediately upon the-ar

How Delegates' Tickets May Be Pre

The executive committee of the Central'
Republican League and the presidents and
secretaries, respectively, of several inde
pendent Republican, clubs held an ani
mated conference last evening* at league
headquarters in the Grand Hotel. The
meeting was called to elicit suggestions
as to the proper plan to be pursued in
making up a delegate ticket In each As
sembly district. The field of suggestion
was wide, embracing hints as to the ad
visability of forming clubs in districts
where independent organization did not
exist. Sentiments in favor of downing
Burns, Crimmins, Kelly and all other
bosses were expressed in forcible and
original terms.
The rooms were crowded at 8 o'clock,
when Zenas U. Dodge called the meeting
to order. The following clubs were repre
sented at the conference:

In announcing the objects of the con
ference Mr. Dodge said it was the deter
mination of the executive committee to
organize a club in each of the eighteen
Assembly districts. He remarked: "The

I to itself. It has no slate and no boss. It
i simply asks that clean, reputable citizens
! be placed on the tickets for delegates,
and it wants your advice and assistance
in this cause." '--â = . -
A suggestion was made by Albert Hess
tha each Assembly district club present
a list of delegates.
A. R. Smith suggested that clubs should
be first formed and in their formation the
precinct registers should be called and
Republicans of known character be se
lected to conduct the organization. He
was opposed to opening the door for
everybody to join, fearing that the Burns.
Crimmins and Kelly push would capture
the clubs. "The moment you announce
a time and place of club organization the

GOODALL DIES
IN ENGLAND
Unexpected End of a
Pioneer.
- â * â  . .
WAS ON A TOUR OF THE WORLD
i â â¢ â
PASSED AWAY UPON REACHING
HIS BIRTHPLACE.
â¦
I Was the Senior Member of the Firm
.v.of Goodall, Perkins & Co. and
a Trustee of Stanford
University.
â¦
Captain Charles Goodall, senior member
of the firm of Goodall, Perkins & Co., died
jin Draycott, Somersetshire, England,
: some time Wednesday. A cable from the
widow to his brother, Edwin Goodall, an
nounced the sad and totally unexpected
event. The news soon became generally
j known and all the ships along the front
i and the business houses set their flags at
1 half-mast and messages of condolence be
gan to pour In upon the family.
On June 10 Captain and Mrs. Goodall
started from San Francisco for a tour of
Europe. The old gentleman was in his
! usual good health, but had been suffering
j from rheumatism. It was the intention
1 of the. couple to visit Draycott, where
Captain Goodall was born, and then go to
I Mrs. Goodall's birthplace in Wales, after
which a tour of the Continent was con
templated. On June 21 they left New
York on the steamer City of New York,
arriving in England nearly three week
ago. Wednesday Captain Charles Miner
Goodall was looking for a letter from his i
father, but instead came the news of his :
death. i
Captain Charles Goodall came to San j
j Francisco early in 1850. After re
! maining here a short time he
I started on a trading cruise to
China, but before going he put all bis
â  spare cash In one of the banks. In the
'â  fall of 1852 he returned to San Francisco,
; only to find that the bank had failed and
all his hard-earned money was gone. In !
January, 1853. he took command of the ;
Sausalito Water Company's water boat
| Rincon, ar.d for years he carried water
from Sausalito to San Francisco. As he
saved money he bought stock in the water
company, and in the course of years ho
and Christian Nelson owned the works
* and the firm of Goodall & Nelson came
' into existence.
Soon after this the firm purchased a
steamer or two and a few schooners,
which they ran up and down the coast.
The business kept on expanding and
George C. Perkins was taken in and the
firm name became Goodall. Nelson & Per
kins. When the Pacific Mail decided to go
'. out of the coasting trade Captain Good
all and his partners purchased its fleet of
steamers and the firm name was changed i
again to the Goodall, Nelson & Perkins I
Steamship Company. This was too long !
a name to suit the business world, so in j
i September. 1876, the Pacific Coast Steam- j
ship Company was formed, with the old j
firm as "agents." A few years later
, Christian Nelson retired from the Arm
I and it became Goodall, Perkins & Co., the
firm of to-day.
Captain Goodall was born in Draycott.
j England. 75 years ago. He left home
i when very young and after a voyage
| around the world and a whaling cruise or
I two In the Arctic he came to California. j
! He was Harbor Master of the port for
I three terms and served one term In the
Legislature. These were his only experi
ences in politics. From 1878 to 1881 and
again from 1887 to 1890 he was a trustee
of the Chamber of Commerce, and at the
time of his death he was one of the trus
tees of the Stanford University and also
lof the University of the Pacific. He was
; a great friend of the Sailors' Home, and
the Ladles' Seamen's Aid Society always
! found in him a champion.
Captain Goodall was twice married. His
, first wife died nearly nine years ago and
in 183. he. married the lady who was at his
bedside when he died. He leaves three
sons nnd two daughtersâ Captain Charles
Miner Goodall. superintendent of the Pa
cific Coast Steamship Company; Captain
Harry W. Goodall, master of the steamer

CLARA FOLTZ RAPS
THE POLICE JUDGES
DENOUNCES THEM AS YOUNG
STERS UNFIT TO HOLD OFFICE.
Animals' Lady Friends Threaten to
Enter Politics in the Interest
of the Brute Creation.
Mrs. Clara Foltz. the well-known lady
lawyer, had an excellent opportunity yes
terday to unburden her mind as to Po
lice Court methods and Police Court
Judges, which she took advantage of. It
was at a meeting of the lady directors
of the Bands of Mercy, a body co-operat
ing with the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals. Two of the ladies
had caused the arrest or a fellow named
Connolly for beating a horse, and while
the evidence of these witnesses showed
that the man had exercised unnecessary
severity in. driving the horse, the Police
Judge before whom the case was heard
1 decided that no creulty had been shown.
; Mrs. Foltz had appeared for the prose-
cutlon. . "<.-"< . '-' , .
The lady made no bones in saying that
the Judges of the Police Courts are unfit
for the positions they hold, because all
of them secure their offices through poli
tics and not on account of any legal
ability they possess. She said: "It is
time for the people to get these young
sters off the bench and elect dignified
gentlemen of ability to fill these impor
tant places." Mrs. Foitz denounced the
very atmosphere of the Police Courts and
said that the places should be kept as
clean as the Superior Courts, and that in
their present condition the Police Courts
of San Francisco are a shame and dis
grace to this city.
The ladies of the board have decided
to give a grand entertainment for the
benefit of the Bands of Mercy, which now
have a membership of nearly 5000 children

AN OVATION FOR THE OREGONIANS.
OREGON'S volunteers, returned from the Phil
ippines, will this morning disembark and
march through the streets of the city to the
Presidio, where they will go into camp until mus
tered out of the service. It is expected the march
will begin about 8:30 a. m., and a detailed account of
the route to be taken will be found in another column.
This morning, then, is the time for San Francisco to
welcome back the heroes who for more than a year
have fought for the" republic in those far-off islands
and have added a new luster to the glory of our mili
tary annals. ,
There is no time to make preparations for any
formal reception or to arrange for any perfunctory
display. The State, the civic and the military authori
ties will of course do their share to give official mani
festation of the honor due to the soldiers of the re
public, but the greater part of the welcome must be
left to the spontaneous enthusiasm of the people. It
must be a popular ovation.
Let every store and shop and office, hotel or home,
?long the line of march, fly its flags this morning.
Let the bells ring, the whistles blow, and the people
cheer. It is a festal day, though it be not a public
holiday. Every feeling of admiration for the brave,
respect for duty nobly done, honor for the loyal sons
of the republic who volunteered to uphold her stan
dard in war, appeals and incites to a full and exuberant
outburst of popular emotion. Let all join in the wel
come.
San Franciscans, Californians, of every party, class,
creed and race, we are all Americans in doing honor
to the men who have fought for our common land.
Spread all your banners to the breeze and give your
hearts full voice in long, loud, triumphant acclama
tions of greeting to welcome the nation's heroes
home.
THE EDUCATIONAL CONVENTION.
WHEN the members of the National Associa
tion of Agricultural Colleges and Experiment
Stations were in convention in this city the
tone of the papers read and of the discussions that
followed disclosed how far agriculture has been
changed from the simple pursuit of tilling the soil
than it was hardly more than fifty years ago. Within
the lifetime of a single generation a revolution has
been effected in the cultivation of farms and orchards.
The agriculture of the past was the oldest industry
in the world except that of cattle-raising. The agri
culture of to-day is so new an industry that it has not
progressed beyond the experimental stage.
Something of the same extraordinary development
has been shown in the profession of school
teaching by the discussions during the educa
tional convention at Los Angeles. School-teaching
is no longer a sirn.ple task of drilling children in read
ing, writing and arithmetic, with a little geography
thrown in. It has become one of the most complex
of professions. Like the new agriculture, the new
teaching is still very largely experimental. It is
broadening in every direction, and will doubtless
eventually include the upbuilding of the whole nature
of the youth of the land, mental, moral and physical.
I'- is at this time difficult to fix the bounds of the
activities of the school-teacher. Wherever the limit
may be placed it will be found that hundreds of enter
piising teachers have passed beyond it. The grammar
schools press upon the high schools and academies,
_ while these in turn crowd upon the colleges and the
universities. Instruction in a hundred things not
dreamed of by the teachers of fifty years ago is now
found even in the country schools, and still the move
ment goes on.
The advance of the profession has been handi
. capped to a considerable extent by the interference
.of politics through school boards. Despite the
jealous watchfulness of the people to prevent the
schools from falling to the politicians as a part of the
spoils of office, many members of school boards
have been better fitted to run a primary election than
a primary school. With all that handicap, however,
the progress and improvement in methods of teach
ing, at well as the increase in the number of objects
to which teaching is directed, have been among the
miracles of human accomplishment in this marvelous
century.
The Los Angeles convention represents the flower
of the best teaching v body in the world. Cer
tain advantages may be possessed by the more thor
oughly drilled teachers of Germany and other Euro
pean lands over our own, but, taken as a whole and
judged by the standard of all that teaching ought to
be, there is no foreign land where the profession of
pedagogy has been raised to so high a level or illu-
mined by such able and faithful leaders as in the
United States. Wheresoever our teachers assemble
they are greeted with honor, and all California joins
with Los Angeles in welcoming the thousands now
with us.
THE BACTERIOLOGICAL CONTRO
VERSY.
THE plain solution of this controversy offered by
The Call has not been accepted by the doctors.
Nevertheless it is probably as nearly correct as
possible under the circumstances. The bacilli, of
monopoly are actually swarming in the Board of
Health, and the bacteriologist of the board must have
encountered them in his "cultures." That they might
easily be mistaken for bubonic missionaries is too cvi-
dent for argument.
But the medical correspondence on the subject is
more intricate than the bubonic plague itself. The
Federal quarantine officer seemed to doubt the quali
fications of the expert fraternally employed by the
Board of Health, and his facilities for the study of the
bacteria that he found to be consumers as well as pro
ducers. Now the Board of Health claims to have
played an ingenious trick upon the Federal quarantine
officer by sending him a slide containing the genuine
bubonic bacteria, which he failed to identify. The
beginning and the middle of the controversy are ap
parently questions of identification. Whether it will
ever have an end or not is problematical.
The bubonic plague seems to have had an oriental
origin, and those most familiar with its history and
with its manifestations doubt whether it could rely
upon- an occidental reception. At all events the conspir
acy of the two Japanese sailors who deliberately com
mitted suicide near the Golden Gate in order to fur-
nish the bacteriologist of the Board of Health. with
scientific "cultures" of bubonic bacilli taken from
their swollen' glands completely failed. The principal
cause for their failure undoubtedly was that neither
of them had the plague.
The Call is inclined to stand by its original theory
and to treat the entire bacteriological investigation as
a study of the Huntington phenomena, working
through Dan -Burns and Governor Gage, out of
which the Board of Health officially originated. If
the "cultures" were followed by thorough fumigation
the heavenly twins* and their close associates may be
for once in a condition to enjoy an interval of com
paratively innocent rest. As the blanket ticket, pro
posed by Kelly and Crimmins, on behalf of their
political sponsors, is over six feet in length, and wide
in proportion, it might be utilized in the only way to
which it is adapted. To see William F. Herrin, Dan
iel M. Burns, Governor Gage and the members of the
Board of Health all lying side by side in refreshing
slumber under its ample folds would be an appro
priate conclusion to the great bacteriological con
troversy. ' .
THE TAX SHIRKER AGAIN.
DURING the discussion on the assessment of
banks held by the Supervisors sitting as a
Board of Equalization on Tuesday a new il
lustration was given of the impudence with which the
Wells-Fargo Company, through its president, John
J. Valentine, carries on the practice of tax shirking.
It shows that the corporation evades State taxes on
its banking business almost as completely as it
evades Federal taxes upon its express business, and
President Valentine has so much contempt for the
public he hardly cares to conceal the fact.
In a statement concerning the difficulty of making
accurate assessments upon some of the banks of the
city, and the obstacles in the way of compelling them
to pay their due share of the public burdens, Assessor
Dodge said: "Wells-Fargo's president only laughed
at us, and he told me that he could come in here next
year and not pay a cent in taxes unless he wanted to,
and I guess he is pretty near right. They simply
unload their taxable holdings among their branches
and we cannot touch them. All that we can assess
them on here is real estate to the tune of $2,172,947
and cash, which they have notified us amounts to
$406,099."
The corporation that thus boasts of ability to shirk
all taxes is one of the richest in America and does an
enormous business in this city. It has its headquar
ters here, and derives most of its profits from the in
dustry that is carried. on here, although it maintains
branches in New York and Portland. It admits prop
erty valued at more than $10,000,000, which it claims
is exempt from taxation. Its president laughs in the
face of the Assessor and mockingly says he will pay
what he pleases, or none at all if he feel like it.
The impunity of the corporation is due to the fact
that it is chartered in Colorado and not in California.
It has thus the advantage enjoyed by the Southern
Pacific of Kentucky. It can carry monopoly with a
high hand in California, because of the charter ob
tained from another State.
The evils resulting from the freedom given under
our. laws for corporations to obtain a charter in one
State for the purpose of doing business in another
have now become so great that an agitation has be
gun in the East for the purpose of devising some
means of remedying the wrong. The offenses of in
solent corporations are far greater in the East than
here, and therefore the first movement to check them
has had its origin there. â 
It will be years, of course, before any sufficient
remedy can be provided for the tax-shirking that i 3
cone in that way. In the meantime each State and
municipality must do the best it can to compel tie
rich tax-shirkers to pay at least a part of what is due
from them in support of the Government which pro
tects their property and their persons. The Super
visors should see to it that since Wells-Fargo has
shirked all of the war tax upon its express company
it shall at least be made to pay its State and county
taxes to the full extent of what- is due.
MAKE WOY FOR THE AUTOMOBILE.
BY the decision of Judge Gibbons of Chicago
that the ordinance passed by the Park Com
missioners of that city prohibiting the use of
automobiles in the parks and along the boulevards is
void, the first step has been taken toward opening a
clear way for the new vehicle, despite the antagonism
which has been manifest in some quarters.
According to Judge Gibbons the Park Commis
sioners of Chicago have, under the laws of Illinois,
no right to prohibit the automobile by name any
more than the bicycle or the dogcart, but it .has the
right, and it is its imperative duty, to prohibit any
vehicle, whether bicycle, horse, carriage or automo
bile, to proceed within the paxks or along the boule
vards at a rate of speed which endangers the safety
of the public.
By that decision the automobile is made as avail
able for general use in Chicago as any other vehicle.
The employment of it for pleasure or for business is
to.be regulated as is that of other vehicles, but is not
to be prohibited.
. .' In addition to declaring the law of the case Judge
Gibbons went on to point out that there is no reason
why there should be any discrimination against the
new invention. He is quoted. as saying it is ''a mat
ter of common observation and scientific knowledge
that there is less danger in propelling an automobile
than there is in driving a horse and buggy," and he
added: "The automobile has com*- to remain with
us and we welcome "it as a great improvement over
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL., FRIDAY, JUI-Y 14, 1899.
horse cars and ordinary street cars. The time is not
far distant when no horse car, trolley car or cable
will be permitted to occupy any of our business
streets. They have served their purpose. They
should be either above or below the surface of our
streets."
There is nothing of exaggeration in the statement
of Judge Gibbons. Hardly a week passes without
bringing reports of some new accomplishment by the
self-propelling carriage, ln France it has just been
demonstrated that by an automobile driven by elec
tricity it is possible to make a trip froil Paris to
Rouen without recharging the storage battery. The
journey occupied seven hours and fifteen minutes,
and the supply of electricity was not exhausted at the
end. It appears, therefore, that electric automobiles
can at the present time be worked at a high rate of
speed for eight hours, the normal hours of a labor
day, without losing time in changing or recharging
batteries.
Of the superiority of the automobile for general
street traffic there can be no doubt. Postmaster Dorr
of Buffalo has recently tested 1 the machine in collect
ing mail, and the results were surprisingly, good. In
the first test mail was collected from forty boxes on a
route eighteen miles long in one hour and thirty min
utes. To cover' the same route with a. horse
wagon required more than three hours. A trial was
made on another route the next morning, when mail
was collected from sixty-three boxes in one-hour and
fifty minutes. The time required for a horse wagon
to cover this route is three hours and five minutes.
Still another test was made on July 4 on another
route fifteen miles in length, with fifty-four boxes,
and collections were all made in ninety minutes.
A vehicle which saves so much of labor and of time
is bound to make its way. Judge Gibbons in the
Chicago case has- simply given a' legal authority to
that which is inevitable. " '.. â 
THE CALIFORNIA WINE TRADE.
HENRY J. CROCKER'S recent offer to enter
'into contracts with. the grape-growers of the
State to purchase all standard varieties of
grapes at $14 a ton has at least had the effect of
arousing the grape-growers and the winemakers to a
renewed consideration of the problems which affect
their industry. It has, therefore, served a good pur
pose, even if it do not result in an agreement between
Mr. Crocker and a sufficient number of the growers
to enable him to control the market and maintain the
price he has offered.
In the meantime it is worth noting that the depres
sion in the wine industry appears to be peculiar to
this State. In a recent letter to the New
York Times reviewing the American wine trade
! generally L. J. Vance, editor of the American
. Wine Press, says it would be hard to match
| the condition of the California wine trade in
j that of any other industry. "At one time," he says,
: "it looked as 'if the wine-growers of California had
â  laid the foundations of a most prosperous and profit
able industry. With an opportunity to supply and
' control (as they should supply and control) the mar
kets of this country, and successfully displace foreign
wines, the California producers failed to grasp their
chance. With every incentive to work together to a
common end, growers and dealers have pulled apart.
Thus, instead of making money, most of the people in
the California wine trade have, for the last few years,
either made no money or actually; lost money." .'(
A very different condition prevails in the wine in
dustry of other parts of the Union, according to Mr.
Vance, who says: "In the wine-growing- districts of
the East â in the South, in New York and in Ohio
there has been no such spirit and methods as entered
j into the California industry. The most prosperous
wine cellars in the country are in the Eastern States.
On this account, perhaps, Eastern wines and Eastern
champagnes are more widely and favorably known by
advertising than the California brands. While the
California establishments were losing, or not making
money, the Eastern cellars have-mostly made money.
.While the Californians were selling their wines at a
nominal rate, the Easterners have often been able to
get double that rate for their goods. Thus, while the
wine production of California has been and is about
five times that of the Eastern States, yet the latter
. brings by far the most money. In fact, the total sales
of the champagnes made in the East, amounting last
year to about 80,000 cases, must have brought as
much money as all the wine. sold in California last
year." ,'
Such statements, coming from such an authority as
that of the editor of the American Wine Press, ought
to have the effect of impressing upon the wine grape
growers and the winemakerÃ of California the folly
of further antagonism and strife. . If the wine industry
of the East is profitable, that of this State, with its
j splendid advantages for the cultivation of vineyards
i and the production of wine, ought to be highly lucra
tive.
The controversy is one in which outsiders cannot
well interfere. It must be settled by the parties at
interest themselves. There appears to be nothing in
the circumstances of the market to depress the indus
try. The outlook, according to Mr. Vance, is promis
ing. He says: "There is certainly a better feeling
in the American wine trade â¢ to-day than for many
years. This is largely due .to ;' "the encouragement
which our winemakers are getting from our wine
drinkers. The old notion that a wine to be good
must be imported is being abandoned, because a num
ber of American wine-cellars are producing still and
sparkling wines admitted by competent judges to
equal in every essential the imported kinds."
. Everything in the situation is therefore encourag
ing, or at least appears so when seen from an Eastern
point of view. There may 'then be some foundation
for holding that if the California wine industry do not
enjoy prosperity it will be largely the fault of the men
who control it.
The Paris has been safely beached in Falmouth
harbor through the skill and energy of the German
wrecking company that undertook the task. Super
intendent Aisbet, in explaining the difficulties of the
work to the Associated Press, gave evidence of won
derment at the currents which he found swirling in
the vicinity of the stranding. If he had read Wednes
day's Call he would not have been so much surprised
at his experience; â¢ the phenomena were explained in
a manner which is usual with The Call â that of ac
curacy.

THE ONLY WOMAN TO RIDE
A QUADRUPLE CENTURY
She Was Taken Exhausted From Her Wheel, but Declares She Is Ready to
Repeat the Ride
THE first woman in the world to ride "a quadruple century" is Mrs. Irene
Brush of New York, who has thereby demonstrated her right to be called
a great woman bicyclist. She rode almost continuously forty-eight hours
to accomplish her great and record-breaking feat. When she had com
pleted her fourth century she was several pounds lighter than when she
began to ride. In fact there was such a change in her appearance that
her acquaintances were shocked. There were great dark rings about her eyes
and she tottered feebly from her wheel. Her pluck had never failed, and she
declared that she was able to make a still greater record. Her physician was
of a contrary opinion, but he nevertheless gave her friends the cheerful as
surance that she was not injured by the unparalleled strain that she had
passed through. When Mrs. Brush was weighed, soon after the ride, she was
astonished to observe that the scales gave her credit for ten pounds less than
she knew she had just before she started on the four-century run. Before
this late feat Mrs. Brush held the record for a triple century ridden by a
woman. â¢ -.'-.
The pace was lively from the start. The task that had been self-imposed
was to cover 400 miles in less than two days. Her husband accompanied her,
and he was as much fatigued as was his wife when the run was over. The
wheel used by Mrs. Brush was a twenty-inch diamond frame, chainless wheel,
82 gear. The handlebars were dropped two inches below the frame. '
At the checking stations there were teams to pace. The run was made on
the same day that Murphy was paced by a locomotive, and Mrs. Brush stop
ped long enough to see Murphy's exploit. Altogether Mrs. Brush slept, four
hours, dozing briefly at intervals. She took bicarbonate of soda and pepsin to
keep her stomach in proper condition. Before she had covered the first hundred
miles she felt tired. She was too plucky to stop, and after awhile her weari
ness went away and she rode in fine spirits. A stop was made for food, which
was sparingly eaten, during the second hundred miles. The second and third
hundred miles were run with hardly any inconvenience and the beginning of the
last hundred miles found Mrs. Brush in good condition and there was little
doubt that she "would succeed. Numbness was unknown alter the first hun
dred miles until toward the end of the last hundred. Then she became drowsy,
but was kept awake. ._â¢*â â â  ...
The Long Island roads, on which Mrs. Brush rode, were in fine condition,
the rain of the previous day having laid the dust. The start was made from
IIS Willoughby street, Brooklyn. The course was by Bath Beach, Coney Island,
and on to Babylon, passing through a score of villages, the turn for the home
ward ride being made at Babylon. There were no serious accidents to mention
on the way. A few punctures were noted. The tire In a rear wheel wore
through and a ball 'in the shaft bearing was broken, so that Mrs. Brush had.
to mount a new wheel at the beginning of the third hundred miles. Twice dur
ing the run she took a tepid bath and was rubbed down. - ;
When the. finish line was passed Dr. Olcott.the family physician, was on
hand to give his services if they should" be necessary. He found that the
plucky woman looked haggard, but her heart" was normal, her temperature was
good and her lungs and stomach were in excellent condition. She was given
an alcohol bath and was put to bed at once. She was allowed to sleep only a
few hours at a time until she had entirely recovered.

IN THE PHILIPPINES
It Is Said to Be Much Worse Than
Official Reports Indicate.
A Returned Array Officer Says It Will Take a Hundred
Thousand Men to Subject the Followers
of Aguinaldo.
cj y\ <~f ry>HAT is the true situation
\\ S\f II in Manila? It is said to I
\Jl\\ll be alarmm S. notwith- j
xi x_/ standing the "reassuring" I
official reports made pub
lic. No transport has returned from
the Philippines for months that its ar
rival has not been followed by disquiet
ing rumors. There are more sick and
wounded, it is said, than there Is room I
in the hospitals or doctors to care for; !
there is more country to be guarded
than can be safely taken care of by the :
troops in the islands; and, stronger
than all and more vital grows the be
lief that it is absolutely impossible to '
subdue the Filipinos with the troops !
now under General Otis. Their num- 1
bers are inadequate and their end. it ;
Is maintained, will be death in ambush
or from disease.
"With the return of the Oregon Volun- j
teers these alarming rumors have been j
renewed so strongly that there is no I
longer much doubt that they are based j
on actual conditions as they exist in ,
the Philippines. For well-known rea- [
sons it Is impossible to get any of the j
returning army officers to stand spon- j
sor over his name for a statement of j
the situation.
"Wait till we're mustered out." sev- j
eral of them said yesterday, "then we j
may be able to tell something. While :
we're In the army it would not do."
The manner of the officers in deliver- 1
ing themselves of this refusal was suf- \
ficient to indicate that they could say I
things if they would and that they
would once they returned to private
life. One man, however, has been
found who knows the conditions. His 1
truthfulness cannot be questioned. He ;
gives an insight into affairs in the |
Philippines that does not fit with the ;
"reassuring" official reports. For the
reason that he still wears the uniform
of an officer of the army of Uncle Sam
he will not allow the use of his name.
In an interview yesterday with a re- j
porter for The Call, he said that the {
Filipinos, in some way, gained the im
pression from Admiral Dewey that he
had come there to give them their free
dom.
"Following Dewey," continued the of
ficer, "came Anderson. He treated Aguin
aldo as head of a republican form of gov
ernment;' also gave him the impression I
that he had but one object there, viz.. to
drive out the Spaniards and then retire.
Merritt on his arrival did all he could to 1
stop that business, and arranged his plans I
so that, going into Manila, he shut them :
out. He treated Aguinaldo as a mere j
brigand who was annoying him by cutting
off his water supply. Merritt was an able
old chap, but he didn't want to stay there.
He wanted to settle things, so he could |
get out just as quick as he could. He |
realized that it was a tough job, and he
wasn't very well equipped to carry on a j

WROTE LOVE LETTERS
THEN TOOK MORPHINE
WILLIAM A. HOUSE WRIGHT,
private In the United States
Hospital Corps at the Presidio,
committed suicide last Wed
nesday night in the Seattle House at
1231 Market street by taking mor
phine.
House - right engaged a room on
Wednesday evening, paying 25 cents
for one night's lodging. Then he spent
an hour or two in writing letters. He
was found about noon yesterday lying
on the bed. The body was cold, and
life had been extinct for several
hours.
The man was undoubtedly Insane.
He labored under the hallucination
that the women nurses in the hos
pital-were conspiring to do him harm,
and that they were circulating lies
about him.
He wrote to Miss Annie Voight, 2514
Green street, tho following letter:
7, 12. '91.
Darling Anna: Why did I meet you?
Since I met you I have had a great deal
of trouble and I am now dying. Please
remember ma ln your hours sometime. I
lpve you so. Good-by. A kiss to you.
Farewell. Those nurses are a terror.
Good-by.
WILLIAM A. HOUSEWRIGHT.
To Miss Lily May Chambers, 22 Perkins street, Augusta. Ga., he wrote:
7, 12, '9Â».
Dearest Lily: I 'am dying. Good-by, my darling. It is the fault of the women
nurses: so good-by, my darling. I am yours in death,
' * â¢ WILLIE HOUSEWRIGHT.
Another letter was to Miss Minnie Hyres of Dumbarton, S. C. It is as
follows: 7. tt. '99.
Dear Loving Minnie: This Is my last letter to you, as I will be cold In death
when you' read It. They are making life miserable for me In the army. The female
nurses are lying. on me and doing everything they can to get me in trouble. They
ought to be kicked out of the service. Look at meâ a big healthy young man who
loves life as. well as any one and who worships his country, being forced to take his
own lire. I have not the time to explain everything, darling, but it is the fault of
the nurses. So my dear darling Minnie please excuse me and think on me sometime
as one who lov.s you dearly now. So one Â»wÂ«>t, loving kiss and one long good-by,
and lam at last cone to meet him who will give me my Just dues. Good-by, sweet.

YOUNG MEDICOS ARE

GRADUATES OF THE COLLEGE OF
PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS.
Annual Commencement Exercises in
the California Theater, Fol
lowed 'by a Banquet.
The California Theater was crowded
Wednesday night, the occasion being the
annual commencement exercises of the
College of Physicians and Surgeons.
*-- Professor J. R. Lame, president of the
board of trustees, acted as presiding offi
cer and conferred the degrees. Dr. Wil
son delivered an address on "The Mercies
of Medical Life," and Colonel Irish spoke
. of. the progress and development of the
science of medicine. T_he invocation and
benediction were delivered by Rev. Mr.
McKelvev. Diplomas were given to nine

dental class.
At the conclusion of the exercises the
newly made physicians and dentists were

republic. He just gave him to understand
that he was a d nuisance and that
he would sit down on him .1 .Â»- annoyed
him (Merritt) too much.
"Otis on his arrival' gave the Filipinos
every latitude. They closed around the
city of Manila and commenced a practical
siege and exacted a toll on every.
that went in or out, and just simply
barred our men from going into their
lines. Tho Filipinos had the freedom of
the city. They even enlisted soldiers in
the old walled city. Merritt's treatment
of the Filipinos had put them on their
mettle, and Otis gayÂ« them every oppor
tunity to form a powerful army. The
Filipinos who were In the Spanish army
were well drilled men. Otis chased these
soldiers out of Manila and they imme
diately went to the Filipino army, these
men would have served with our army;
in fact, they begged to be allowed to join
it, but Otis' action drove them to the en
emy. There were probably low of these
soldiers. '
. "Before the outbreak Otis had treated
the Filipinos as though he was afraid of
them. He used no firmness with them,
and they got the Impression that all they
had to do to take Manila was to come
and get it. Otis' policy was certainly a
very weak one. The Filipino army and
our army were so close together previous
to the outbreak that the outposts of the
two armies were not more than two feet
apart. With these Filipinos in
sulting and abusing our men continually
and accusing us of being afraid of them,
there was but one result that could hap
pen and that was a .fight.
"After the American soldier had been
in the leash so long nothing could stop
him, not even bad generalship. General
King said: 'There goes the American
soldier and all hell can't stop him!' Otis
is unquestionably a great office man.
When it comes down to saving ten cents
he is a great general. He devotes the
most of his time to finding out whether
some clerk is entitled to rations or not.
As a great general of a fighting army
he is decidedly a failure.
"Reports as a rule have been colored
from Manila. The plain fact of the mat
ter is a hundred thousand troops are
needed. That is the very smallest num
ber that can subjugate these Filipinos.
It is an Impossibility that the present
army, which numbers probably 35.000
men, can ever conquer these people. Our
policy of moving through 1 country and
gaining victories without establishing
garrisonsâ merely moving on through the
country and allowing the enemy to oc
cupy again positions we have just taken â
is surely no advantage to us.
"The Hospital Corps has done effective
work considering the way it has been
handled, which has been very economi
cally. There is a large number of wound
ed and sick who might recover and be
fit for duty again if sent to the United
States, but they can never hope to re
cover in that climate. If these men were
sent home It would leave more room in
the hospitals and the corps could better
attend to other patients.
"The" policy of the present government
over there has been to send encouraging
reports to tn. United States, but tacts
have not warranted these reports. Peo
ple of the United States must make up
their minds that these islands will cost
a great many million dollars and the loss i
of at least ten thousand more lives before
the Government ever realizes any profit. I
The number of sick and wounded in the j
hospitals is very large, and something
certainly should be done 10 increase the
hospital facilities." I

A Well Known Specialist Relocates
Here.
After an absence of more than a de
cade Dr. : E. S. Aborn has returned to
San Francisco to resume active prac
tice in his profession. In his specialtyâ
the diseases of the eye and ear, catarrh,
asthma and lung affectionsâ the doctor,
during his absence in the East, has re
peated his prior successes in a quarter
of a century of practice in San Fran
cisco. In this class of diseases Dr.
Aborn ranks with the few great, spe
cialists of the United States.
His treatise on consumption and its
possibility of cure is recognized as one
of the best essays on that dread dis
ease. It is peculiarly fitting and a
source of gratification to residents here
that so successful a practitioner should
choose to round out an honorable
career In the field of his early suc
cesses.

in some quarters, but after all It cuts little
figure in the market as yet. According to crop
reports from Oregon, not half last year's yield
will be produced, and the Quality of those will
be unsatisfactory in many localities, owing to
injury from cold. The California crop appears
to be* doing well and promises abundantly. The
French and Turkish crops are likely to be
short, which will cause a better demand for
American goods abroad.
"No opening prices on apricots were reportea
yesterday and, so far as learned, no sales at
prices to" be made occurred. Exporters send in
numerous inquiries, but no business results.
The output is likely to be more abundant than
was estimated. Spot stocks are closely con
trolled and in second hands. Not a car Is re
ported in firtt hands in this market. The mar
ket on the coast is reported entirely cleaned up.
â¢â¢peaches on the spot are closely controlled
and entirely In second hands. Some holders are
sold out. while others have a few left. Prices
tend upward on old goods but sales are re
stricted in the absence of liberal supplies.
"There is nothing new ln raisins. Trade In
all departments la dead. Some seeders are send
ing in a few small orders, but the supply is so
small that ll amounts to no business at all.
There is little or no demand for foreign goods.
and prices are merely nominal."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, July 13.â The heaviness which
was predominant in the stock market to-day
represented the shifting Wall-street sentiment
regarding the money situation more than any- <
thing else, though it was emphasized by the !
rise in the Bank of England's minimum rate j
to 3% per cent and the acute weakness of the I
local traction stocks, especially Brooklyn
Transit, which dropped over 3% at one time.
Wall street had it that a strike had actually !
been declared, ana the stocks in that group
rallied when this canard was denied. Wall
street seemed to lay more stress on the advance j
in the Bank of England rate than itself. The '
stock market then? was dull, but prices, espe
cially of Americans, were well maintained, in
spite of the rise in the rate of discount. There
was a 6hai_> rally ln British consols and In !
French rentes and foreign markets seemed to j
be relieved from the tension of apprehension !
over the Transvaal situation, but nevertheless '
prices of the internationals led the decline ln .
New York and many stocks had. fallen a point .
in the course of the first hour, the grangers .
being conspicuous. Sugar also developed early
weakness and only partly recovered its decline. .
The Southwestern stocks offered a point of re- ;
eistance, Missouri Pacific leading, as was the ;
case yesterday, and St. Louis Southwestern :
preferred and Texas Pacific following the rise.
Anaconda was also strong, following London's
lead, and was at one time up 2 points. There
was sympathetic â  activity and strength in :
Amalgamated Copper in the outside market,
the shares rising above 39. During the after
noon strength developed in Federal Steel,
American Steel and Wire, American Car pre
ferred and Cotton Oil. which indue. d a gen
eral recovery in the specialties. Northern Pa
cific rose to 51 ln the late dealings and checked
the declining tendency on realizing. New York
Air Brake, after an early decline. Jumped 7%
point*, and Mobile and Ohio rose 5. The local
money market was easier In tone, but operators
who bought yesterday on the prospect of a fa- I
vorable bank statement were Inclined to feel j
that they had exaggerated the prospective bene- ;
fit. There were realizing sales from this ;
source. .
New York Central's Increase In gross earn- '
ings for June of 1560,084 helped the late recov- I
cry' in the market. The close was about steady .
at mixed trains and losses.
The railroad bond market was rather dull i
, and irregular, the Southwestern railroads being '
In good demand. Total sales, par value, 82,825,- j
000.

bid price.

THE LONDON MARKET.
NEW TORK, July 183â The Commercial Ad- j
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The bank rate was raised % to 3% per cent,
and accordingly three months' bills were quot- !
ed at 3%Â©3% c, six months' bills at 3%Â©4 c.
Those rates, however, were really nominal, as
little was done. The loan market was unset- i
tied. Discount houses raised the rate on de- i
posits to 2c at call, 2%e at notice. The mar- ]
ket steadied on the removal of the uncertainty :
about the bank rate, but business was meager,
though the tone was steady. Americans were j
firm till the afternoon when they relapsed on j
New York's failure to buy. New York bought j
at the lower prices, but the close was easy. 1

METALS Developments in metals to-day |
were something of a sensational order bo far |
as tin was concerned, a pressing demand from i
consumers and other buyers sending prices 100 !
Â©102% points higher. The bulge originated in ;
good reports from the West, strong cables and
an unwillingness of holders to make further j
sales pending more definite knowledge on the
situation generally. The other departments
showed sympathetic strength but little price
variations. At the close the Metal Exchange
called:

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, July 13. -Wheat opened weak
and lower at 73%Â©73% c for September, com
pared with yesterday's advance here. This and
the continued large movement of wheat in the
Northwest, seasonable weather and the rather
bearish summary of the Price Current caused
considerable liquidation and a further decline '
to 73% c occurred. This was around put price,
and buying against those privileges arrested
the decline. News in regard to the spring
wheat crop caused considerable apprehension ;
among shorts. Some sections of the Northwest
reported an excess of rain, others too much 1
heat, while North Dakota reported grasshop- '
pers doing considerable damage ln the wheat
fields. This started a general buying move- I
ment and the highest price of the day re
sulted. September reached 74% c and held for
some time at about that figure. The absence |
of demand for cash wheat, unnoticed during the
morning, became a decided weakening feature
In the situation in the afternoon, Berlirt ad- '
vices were to the effect that Russia was offer
ing rye and barley heavily for fall shipment.
As this was contrary to previous Russian ad- |
vices the news was rather discouraging to |
holders and started liquidation, which became 1
heavy toward the close. September gradually
declined to 73%073%c. but rallied under short |
covering to 73% C, which was the closing price.
Corn was moderately active and weak, fol- i
lowing closely the fluctuations of wheat. Sep- I
tember closed %Â©%c lower.
Oats were firm and higher early. Later -the
market weakened somewhat with wheat. Sep
tember closed %c lower.
Provisions were active and Irregular. The
market advanced sharply early on a good gen- I
eral demand, owing to moderate hog receipts
and higher yard prices. Later a heavy realiz
ing movement carried the prices steadily* down- :
ward. The close was steady, with pork and |
lard 2%e lower and ribs 5c lower.

cash demand, and the outlook was for lower

ishing receipts, caused free buying on North

The local market was off a fraction and
quieter on shipping account. Futures were also
lower.

MADE AGAINST
TRUSTEE MORIES
Suit Filed by John R.
Johnson.
â â
SEEKS TRUSTEE'S REMOVAL
â â¦ â
ALLEGES THAT MONEY ON DE
POSIT HAS DISAPPEARED.
â¦
Claims Dr. Mories Misappropriated
Money and a Holy Bible, Also
Two Diamond Shirt
Studs.
â¦
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, July 13.
A Holy Bible is made one of the bones
of contention in a suit filed in the Supe
rior Court this afternoon by John R.
Johnson, wherein the latter seeks the re
moval of Dr. A. H. Mories, an Alameda
dentist, as trustee of the $10,000 estate of
Mrs. Mary J. Clifton, who died in Chi
cago, lli., June 11, 1893. Dr. Mories hcs
been cited to appear before Judge Hall
next Monday. .
Johnson is the only surviving son of
Mrs. Clifton, and under the terms of her
last will, dated October 10, 1892, the entire
estate, consist!) of $1005. on deposit in
the Union Savings Bank; $580 75 other per
sonal property and real property at the
northwest corner of Clay and Ninth
st-eets, worth $SSOO, is bequeathed to Dr.
Mories In trust for the son. Mories is
named as executor without bonds and
with full power to sell. The trustee, who
is also named as executor, is instructed
to reserve as compensation for his serv
ices 6 per cent of the gross income of the
estate, and after all claims are settled he
is ordered to pay all necessary expenses
of the son or beneficiary. The -will was
probated on June 26. 1883. and on October
6 1894, the estate was distributed to Mo
ries as trustee.
In Johnson's complaint, prepared by At
torney J. E. McElrath, grave charges of
misappropriations are alleged. Plaintiff
nvers that since January 1, 1899, Mories
should have received $180 as rent of the
real property and $20 as dividends from
money in bank, but that he has paid him
but $65, leaving $125 balance due, less com
mission. , -._.
Continuing, plaintiff alleges: "That Mo
ries has not any sum In the Union Sav
ings Bank or any other bank to his credit
as' trustee, but petitioner is advised and
believes that said lories has used and
appropriated said money to his own use
and fraudulently pretends that the money
Is In the bank." . ._.___.
Charges are also made that Mories has
wrongfully and illegally and for his own
profit appropriated considerable . silver
ware, gold watches, rings and two dia
mondsâthe latter being now worn by htm
as shirt studs.
Also, "That Mories has as an orna
mental book only, ln his parlor, the Holy
Bible that belong to petitioner's mother,
which Is a book of very exquisite manu
facture worth $25, but the divine precepts
of which said Mori-?- never consults.
"Th it Mories pretended to sell the per
sonal property distributed to him as trus
tee, out instead of so doing purchased at
his own sale, which was private and
without notice, much of the furniture and
property of the estate for much less than.
the appraised value. Also, that he has in
his possession a lot of rare coins, worth
$25, and belonging to the estate, of which
he never rendered an account."
Johnson avers that he is now- sick and
in need of medicine and proper treatment
and clothing, on account of which $500
should be drawn from the principal of the
6StÂ£lt6.
He asks that the trustee be cited; that
he render an account and that he be re
quired to pay the income due petitioner as
provided for in his mother's will, and
finally that Mories be removed as trus
tee.
FUTURE ACQUISITIONS
OF THE SANTA FE
OAKLAND, July 13.â The statement
published in The Call this morning that
the Santa Fe "controlled" the electric
btreet system of Oakland has caused
much comment and brought forth some
denials that, although the ownership of
the syndicate railroad by the Santa Fe
must 'naturally come about in the future,
it is not yet an accomplished fact.
Secretary Taylor of the syndicate roads
admitted to-day that the cars of all tho
branches of the syndicate lines are to be
painted the same color as the cars of the
Santa Fe system; but he also declared
that he took his orders from the transit
company and not from the Santa Fe.
Chief Engineer Story of the Valley Rail
road also says that the Santa Fe has not
yet acquired the streetcar lines of Oak
land.
â frame Manager Bissell of the Santa Fc
was recently in San Francisco and de
clared that owing to the unexpected diffi
culties ln constructing me of the tun
nels on the Valley road the Santa Fe
would not this year at least negotiate for
the purchase of the little California and
Nevada Railroad, which runs from Em
eryville Into Contra Costa County.
Discussing this Important matter the
Enquirer says:
The best that can be Mid of the story is
that It Is a little premature. Possibly the
Banta Fe may some day control the syndicate
system at Oakland street railways. Even now
that railroad corporation may have Its eye on
tbe system But in view of Its refusal to con
sider the matter Of a terminal in Oakland, or
if buying up the California and Nevada Rail
rood's franchise until parly next year, tt
seems Improbable ... local street car sys
tem has been acquired aire:
Th. article In The Call which has cre
ated such Interest was not only based on
certain facts within its knowledge but on
many other conditions, the existence of
which has long been known to Oakland

CORN CROP THREATENED.
Unknown Disease Attacks Bay Farm
Island Fields.
ALAMEDA. JuIy 13.â Horticultural Com
missioner Pryal has discovered a disease
which threatens the sweet corn, crop of
this side of the bay. The discovery was
made to-day during the Commissioner's
visit to Bay Farm Island, where corn is
raised ln abundance for the San Francisco
market. . .
The disease is in the shape of a fun
gus growth, which attaches itself to the
stalk and apparently saps the life out of
the plant. It swells into peculiar forms.
Is covered with a skin of greenish color
and the inside is of a black powdery sub-
stance.
Mr. Pryal says ho has never seen any
thing of the kind In the State, and is at
a loss to account for It. ' It has done great
damage in the cornfields where it has
made its appearance, and unless its
spread is checked it la liable to create
havoc.

AWAIT GREAT
ANNUAL ACT OF
E. BLACK RYAN
Railroad Values to Be
Equalized.
LOCAL LINES ON THE ROLL
â â
THE STATE BOARD OBLIGINGLY
TAKES THEM OFF.
. â¦
The Corporation Has Not Kept Its
Pledge to Take Certain Mat
ters Into the Courts for
Settlement.
â¦
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July. 13.
E. Black Ryan will be on hand next
week to perform his great annual act be
fore the Supervisors. Mr. Ryan's act is
a specialty which no one can perform
with equal grace, agility and equanimity.
It Is the duty of Mr. E. Black Ryan,
tax agent of the Southern Pacific, to
prove that the Southern Pacific Railroad
Company and all Its tentacles are In the
throes of poverty; that they are bank
rupt; that' none of Its bondholders are
making anything out of the road; that
its property Is worthless, and that it
would be a charitable act on the part
of the county of Alameda to remit all
or nearly all of its 'taxes and allow the
railroad company to pursue its poverty
stricken way ln peace.
Mr. Ryan has studied his part so thor
oughly M.at he has long been perfect.
An audience can always be depended
on to witness and decry his performance.
In Oakland his particular efforts are di
rected to proving that the Seventh street
local line, which carries more passengers
than any other seven miles of railroad
this side of Chicago, is not in existence;
that it is simply a part of the company s
main line system, although an overland
train or even a Haywards local has
never passed over It during all the days
of its existence. On the contrary, It is
a street railroad pure and simple, for
traffic over which the corporation sell*
five-cent tickets, only it has them marked
to Fruitvale or to Alameda to evade the
law requiring them not to charge trans
portation within the limits of the city of
Oakland.
County Assessor Dalton always places
these wealthy properties on the assess
ment roll, and in many Instances the
State Board of Equalization has decided
that the local lines are being doubly as
sessed, as it is the province of the State
Board to assess all railway lines in Cali
fornia. _ _
Last year the Supervisors voted to sus
tain Mr. Dalton, but on the part of Su
pervisor Mitchell a signed statement was
made by him declaring that he voted with
the understanding that the railroad com
pany should take the matter into the
courts and test the question once for all.
This has not been done and consequently.
Mr Mitchell is bound to vote to sustain
the Assessor on all disputed assessments.
Sitting as a Board of Equalization to
day. the Supervisors reduced the assess
ment of Irving C. Lewis from $8260 to
$5000 Lewis showed that the property ,
had changed hands within a year for
$6500. ___; _
ROSSETER MUST PAY *
BOARD FOR HIS DOGS
OAKLAND, July 13.â 1n the long pend
ing suit of Sander versus Rosseter,
brought on an assigned claim from Dr.
Diete, an Alameda veterinarian, for
boarding several of defendant's hounds,
Judge Ogden has given plaintiff Judg
ment for $7:. and costs. The defense set
up the plea that Diete was not a regu
larly licensed veterinarian, but it. devel
oped that Diete had afterward secured a
license from the State Board of Veteri
narians, which board was created by the
act of 1893. The constitutionality of this
act was next attacked, and although
judgment was given for plaintiff, the
court ruled, according to the Interpreta
tion of defendant's attorney, that the act
of 1593 is unconstitutional, and that the
State board could not legally give Diete
a license, practically holding the board
to be non esse.

PRETTY WEDDING
IN EDEN TOWNSHIP
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, July 13.
THE prettiest summer wedding
San Leandro has witnessed for a
long time was the union last night
of Emilie D. Leldel and John A.
Holmgren. The ceremony was per
formed by Rev. Dr. Woods In the
large parlors decorated in pink and
green.
The bride Is the niece of L. Palm-,
tag of Haywards, where she has lived
some years and where she is deserved
ly .popular, no social or fraternal
function in -Eden Township being
complete without her. John A.
Holmgren is the son of Dr. Holmgren
an escort In the person of a handsome
officer she changed her mind and began
prattling at random over imagined
fancies, riches and gay lovers, and made
complaint over hotel charges at the
Grand In San Francisco. Captain
Peterson promptly telephoned to the
Grand and learned that the pretty
senorita of twenty-two summers had
been ordered out of the hotel on ac
count of her strange actions and that
she had registered as Miss A. Estava.
She was removed to the Receiving
Hospital. In a lady's bag which she
carefully guarded were found papers
and documents in Spanish, also . a
marriage certificate of Marcos Mesa,
aged 60, and Ruiigio Sanchez, aged 40,
dated at San Jose, June 4, 1877, and
signed by Anthony Gletz. Afterward
she claimed that her parents died
eight years ago at Dos Angeles and
that she had just come from there for
a "good time." But again she would
cry that her father, Don Gonzales
Estava, was living and would kill her
should he hear of her strange experi

FALMOUTH, July 13.â 0n entering the
tidal harbor to-day the steamer Paris, re
cently aground on the Manacles, under
the influence of wind and tide became
temporarily unmanageable. ' Her stern
swung round and struck the end of a
wooden pier upon which a large crowd
had gathered. The pier shook n from end

stricken and made an ugly rush for es

regained and she was safely anchored.
Superintendent Aisbet of the wrecking
companies gave a representative of tit.

of a startling nature to the controversy as

from my husband," said Mrs. Golden,
"because he tailed to provide for me.
A year later I lost my eyesight. Dr.
Cornwall said it was because there
was too much acid ln my system, and
now my mind is gradually weakening.
1 am getting so that I destroy my
clothing and want to get away because
. I imagine men are trying to get Into
my room." All last night Mrs. Golden
sat up in a chair, refusing to lie down,
for she cannot sleep, and the asylum,
where she might be treated, is now her
only hope.
: It was ebb tide, with a northerly wind
blowing, which would naturally take the
vessel south; but we found her getting
nearer and nearer the Manacles until
i within 400 yards of them, whereas we
j ought to have been a mile to the south
ward. Things looked queer for a time,
but we altered our tactics and cleared the
rock. From what 1 have seen during the
past six weeks, I am confident some mys
terious current draws the vessels toward
the rocks. While working on the Paris
we warned numberless vessels of the
danger they were in."
FOUND A NEW-MADE
GRAVE ON HIS FARM
SAN JOSE, July 13.â Charles T. Boots
of the Elmwood stock farm was walk
ing through a brushy part of the farm
late this afternoon, when he saw a man
and woman in the willows on the bank
of the Coyote River, who hurried away
upon his approach.
On going to the spot he saw an open
grave in the loose, sandy soil. It is
supposed if they had not been observed
some one would have been buried there
during the night, perhaps a victim of
foul play, and possibly to save funeral
expenses.

FELL IN AND
OUT OF LOVE
VERY QUICKLY
Aged Mr. Boardman
Is Forgetful.
9
LOVED A SWISS LAUNDRESS
â â¢ â
MRS. GLADSTONE'S CLAIM IS
WITHOUT FOUNDATION.
â¦
The Capitalist Very Much Surprised
That the .elderly Widow
Should Ask Half a
Million.
â¢
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
DOS Broadway, July 13.
The story of aged Mr. Boardman's loves
has not been half told. It has not been
one-quarter told. According to a former
statement of Mr. Boardman and ultimate
developments, only one twenty-second part
of the romances of his affections has yet
been unfolded.
The many acquaintances of the amorous
old gentleman are not surprised that Mrs.
Elizabeth Gladstone should want half a
million dollars for her wounded heart.
They would be less surprised if half a
dozen others should appear, each claiming
a substantial salve for broken affections.
It has now developed that on the very
afternoon of the day on which aged Mr.
Boardman led the handsome young high
school girl to the altar he proposed to
the lovely young daughter of his Swiss
washerwoman. This pretty little maiden
absolutely refused to have anything to
do with the man nearly five times her
age, and said that death would be prefer
able to such a union. Considerably an
noyed with this rebuff, the old man went
back to Miss Walker and hurriedly com
mitted matrimony.
The youthful Mrs. Boardman says that
she Is surprised that Mrs. Gladstone who
is almost an octogenarian herself, should
have brought suit against her husband.
The girl-wife says she has known Mrs.
Gladstone for a long timeâ even before
the death of the second Mrs. Boardman
four months ago. She says Mrs. Glad
stone even came to their house and con
gratulated her on her marriage, hut said
not one word about the fearful crevasse
in her own heart which she now declares
can only be closed by a half-million dollar
plaster. _Â *,
Mr. Boardman. who, like Mrs. Glad
stone, has had three spouses, but, unlike
her, is not the parent of seventeen chil
dren, admits a faint recollection of a
certain Mrs. Gladstone, but he ridicules
the idea that he ever loved her or that
he ever Intended to marry her.
This is partly borne out by Mr. Board
man's oft-repeated statement prior to his
marriage to Blanche Walker, in which he
said that the girl for him must not be
more than 17 and that she must be a
plump little damsel. When he did marry
he calmly said that it would be folly to
suppose that he was drawn into the
wedding by Blanche's mother, because
Blanche was but one of twenty girls any
one of whom he could have for a wife.
Mrs. Gladstone and the Swiss washing
girl make up the twenty-two to -Whom
Boardman made love between February
the day of his wife's death, and June 4.
the date of his third marriage.
Mr. Boardman is not having everything
his own way snee he married. In addition
to the discharging of the men cleaning
the house by the mother-in-law. there
have been other differences of opinion.
Only a few days ago Mr. Boardman pur
chased some shades for his house. With
his usual economy, he bought shades of
a very cheap pattern. This did not suit
his aristocratic mother-in-law, and half
an hour later she appeared at the store
demanding that the shades be changed for
a quality more in keeping with the pre
tensions of a man who is supposed to be
worth nearly half a million dollars.
So far nothing has been heard about Mr.
Boardman having made a will. It is
known that there is one heir in this Stat
and many more in the East, and It is ex
pected that before long the courts will be
teeming with litigation arising from the
romantic marriage of the 75-year-old man
and the 17-year-old schoolgirl.
UNION LEAGUE CLUB
RECEIVES A WINDFALL
Mrs. Stanford's Generosity Relieves
It of a Very Considerable
Debt.
Another act of generosity on the part
of Mrs. June Stanford came to light Wed
nesday through resolutions adopted by
the directors of the Union League Club on
the 21Â»th of last month, which have only
just now been made public.
Many years ago Mr. Stanford subscribed
for llfty $10 bonds issued by the club. For
a time the interest was regularly paid
upon them, but finally, owing to financial
distress, the interest was allowed to lapse
until it amounted to quite a sum.
Just before her departure for Europe
last May the matter came to the notice of
Mrs. Stanford as she was going over her
affairs previous to her leaving. It was as
certained that the financial standing of
the club had Improved and that there was
no necessity to worry about any interest
connected with any of its bonds. Mrs.
Stanford thought the matter over, and
coming to the conclusion that, notwith
standing the club's improved financial
condition, a little present would not be
amiss she voluntarily surrendered not only
the unpaid interest, but the bonds as well,
thus relieving the club from considerable
of its Indebtedness.
The following are the resolutions adopt
ed by the directors of the club to express
their gratitude to their benefactress:
Whereas Mrs. Jane L. Stanford has sur
rendered to this club fifty (50) bonds heretofore
Issued by the club in denominations or sums
of ten ($10) dollars each without any com
pensation therefor, and has also voluntarily re
linquished her right to the unpaid interest
thereon and whereas, the surrender of the
said bonds and the unpaid Interest Is a per
sonal gift of Mrs. Stanford, and, moreover, of
most estimable value, accompanies therewith
her kindest wishes to the club. Therefore be
Resolved That the Union League Club of Pan
Francisco,' through its board of directors,
hereby expresses Its sincere appreciation of the
generosity and kindness of Mrs. Stanford as
indicated by the facts above noted.
Resolved, further. That a copy of these reso
lutions be conveyed to Mrs. Stanford, together
with the good will and best wishes of the club,
and with the hope that her health and happi
ness may be ever commensurate with the ex
alted character of her kind and generous deeds.
Galindo Held for Trial.
Charles Galindo was held by United
States Commissioner Heacock yesterday

were seized at the door for evidence by

The Recent Bitter Misunderstanding
Is Now in a Fair Way to
Be Amicably Ad
justed.
â¦- â .
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, July 13.
An effort having been made to prove
that Mayor Snow had promised to' reap
point Street Superintendent Miller in case
of his . defeat for City Engineer, the
Mayor to-day issued the following written
opinion referring to the subject:
"Dr. Pardee never asked me during the
last municipal campaign to vote for Mr.
Miller for Superintendent of Streets, DOT
since the campaign for that matter.
"We were all taking it for granted that
Mr. Miller would be elected City Engineer
and were working for the election of the
whole ticket.
"No bargain was made between the doc
tor and myself for his support of the
ticket nor for any man on It.
"There was some difference between us
as to campaign methods, and the result
was that the doctor and Mr. Dalton
fought the battle in their own way and I
mine.
"No. I made no statement concerning
Mr. Miller's future to either of the gentle
men. I would certainly remember it if I
did, and I have no recollection of Mr. Mil
ler being mentioned except as City Engi
neer." __ .
Dr. Pardee remains silent. He refuses
to be interviewed on the proposition, de
claring that to the best of his belief there
have been misquotations made in regard
to the question of reappointing Mr. Miller.
Mayor Snow and Dr. Pardee met to
night and discussed the statements oft
repeated that the Mayor had once prom
ised to re-elect Mr. Miller Superintendent
of Streets.
Dr. Pardee called to his honor s memory
what he said was a fact that at a gath
ering at the doctor's home prior to the
last election the matter of Miller had
been discussed. Mr. Miller was then run
ning on the same ticket as Snow for City
Engineer. There was some talk that
Miller might be defeated, and Mr. Snow
said that if he (Snow) were elected Mayor
and Miller was defeated the latter would
retain his job as Superintendent of
Streets. This is Dr. Pardee's statement.
The Mayor told the doctor that he did
not recollect the conversation or anything
that he had said that might be construed
into such a meaning. .._.._.
To-night's meeting was brought by the
Mayor calling on Dr. Pardee.

GROCERS' ALLIANCE
ELECTS DIRECTORS
RETAIL MERCHANTS COMBINE
TO CORRECT ABUSES.
Wholesalers to Help, and the Organi
zation of the Entire State Is
Anticipated.
"Wet" grocers and "dry" grocers, men
with several stores and smaller merchants
with diminutive stocks made up the at
tendance at B'nai B'rith Hall Wednesday
when the Grocers' Alliance elected its first
board of directors. The nine men chosen
from the twenty-one candidates were rep
resentative of every class of trade. Two
keep bars, seven sell liquor, two are tem
perance grocers, three have small stor|_,
two have large establishments and tne
other. four have two or more stores each.
The men chosen were John Lackmann,
Joseph A. Stulz. Alexander Irvine, Daniel
F. Keefe, H. B. Arnold, James West, J.
E. A. Helms, Thomas Cluff and J. J.
The movement Is looked upon as of
great Importance to the trade since the
local Grocers' Alliance' is regarded as
the forerunner of similar organizations in
every large town of the State. Alliances
are expected to accomplish a great deal
in the way of suppressing deadbeats, ob
taining desirable legislation and correct
ing trade abuses since they will be backed
up with the influence of the Associ___ed
Wholesale Grocers, which now Includes all
the wholesale grocers of this city, Sacra
mento, Marysvllle, Los Angeles and San
Jose. .' "---'-'- y - 'â '. â â â 
The Grocers' Alliance of San Francisco
was only recently conceived. It already
numbers nearly 400 members and It is
thought will eventually absorb the two
present warring factions of retailers,
neither of which has been able to ac
complish much since the wholesale gro
cers held aloof from both. The retail gro
cers suffer from many evils which they
expect to overcome by combination.
The newly elected board of directors is
to meet at 4 o'clock this afternoon in the
rooms of the Associated Wholesale Gro
cers, at 123 California street. It will then
proceed to elect officers and take the
necessary steps for beginning active work.

AT ASSESSMENT
Demands a Cut of

â â¦ â
BANKS OBJECT TO TAXATION OF
BONDS.
*
Protests That Aggregate Millions
Filed With the Board of Equali
zation, Which Will Con
sider Them To-Day.
-
The Market Street Railway Company
will lead the long line of corporations that '
will march to-day before the Board of j
Equalization armed with protests against
the assessments Assessor Dodge has I
placed upon their holdings. Henry Lynch,
manager of the Market street system,
filed his "protest with Chief Clerk Russell
at . 4 o'clock yesterday afternon. Mr.
Lynch In his petition denies that Assessor
Dodge has any right whatsoever, under
the law, to assess the company's fran
chise, but at the same time admits thai
he had by applying for a reduction in
stead of a cancellation. . : : . '
Mr. Dodge fixed his figures on the com
pany's franchise at the extremely low fig
ure of; $10,047,569. The company through
Mr. Lynch asks for a reduction to $6,479,
--019, a reduction of $3,568,550. It gives 'no
reason for its figures; - it quotes no basis
or system of calculation by which it ar
rived at them; it" simply says that the
county has no right to tax Its franchise
anyway, but that out of the sheer good
heartedness that characterizes that ami
able corporation it will stand taxation to
the extent it arbitrarily lays down.
Almost as modest are the Spring Valley
people. They go farther than the Market
street crowd, in that they back their pro
test with a reason for it. Spring Valley's
franchise is assessed at $3,500,000; it wants
these figures reduced to $2,500,000. The
pipe line is valued at $3,636,000, which fig
ure it want's pared down to $2,182,000. In
support of its protest it says that when
the water rate was fixed by the Board of
Supervisors the amount of taxes the com
pany would have to pay was figured in
making up the rate schedule, and that the
assessments of Mr. Dodge are in excess of
that calculation. If Dodge's figures are
allowed to obtain, says the company, the
legal income allowed it in the fixed rate
will be impaired, consequently they have
figured their reduction on & scale to con
form to the rates established.
To-day the banks and the money brok
ers will go before the board to show cause
why the assessments on their property
should not be placed at a figure some
where near commensurate with their as
sets. Ten o'clock this morning is fixed
as the hour for them to appear, and 10
o'clock will see the representatives of
more millions that will appear on the en
tire assessment roll on hand to convince
the board that they are one and all on the
verge of bankruptcy, and have merely
pennies where the Assessor says they
have dollars.
By the resolution adopted by the board
on Tuesday every banking and money
broking Institution in the city has been
summoned to appear. A number of them
are already attempting to ward off pos
sible increases in their assessments by
applying for reductions in the figures al
ready established by Assessor Dodge. Of
these the bank of Wells, Fargo & Co.,
which Mr. Dodge classed as one of the
slipperiest customers on his list, has been
first to come to the front. With a sur
plus of over $10,000,000 on a capital of
$500,000 the bank has the supreme nerve
to swear that it is worth in assessable
property only $516,099. The modest figures
,of Assessor Dodge are based on a taxable
valuation of $726,744, but the corporation
in a protest filed yesterday demands that
that amount be decreased by $210,645.
The Hibernia Banking Association, one
of the -wealthiest banking institutions in
the country, asks for a reduction in its
assessment of a cool million and a half.
Assessor Dodge's figures on the bank's
taxable assets are as follows: Bonds of
the Market-street Railway Company, $1,
--127,000; bonds of the Spring Valley Water
Works, $258,750; bonds of the Sutter-street
Railway Company, $168,750; bonds of the
Powell-street Railway Company, $60,500.
Total, $1,615,0Q0.
In addition to these the bank's fran
chise is assessed at $5000 and there is a
United States check for $121,875 for inter
est due on United States bonds and loans
on bonds to the tune of $10,000. President
Kelly claims that these assessments are
not only excessive, but in a number of
cases illegal in that no deduction was
made for bonds held as security on loans.
He asks for a reduction from $2.601,3.. to
$849,002.
The Pacific Gas and Improvement Com
pany asks only a million off on its. as
sessment. Its franchise is valued by the
Assessor at $1,579,721. Its entire assess
ment is $2,445,450. It wants a reduction
to $1,445,450.
The Oakland Water Company, assessed
$400,000 on its franchise, and the Contra
Costa Water Company with a $750,000 as
sessment want to be cut off the list en
tirely, notwithstanding that their prin
cipal places of business are in this city.
A dozen other of the banks of the city,
with bond assessments aggregating $8,
--000,000, filed protests asking that their
bond assessments be canceled upon the
ground of their illegality. They will all
have an opportunity to prove their cases
this morning and to-day's session should
lack nothing of interest.
SOME OF THE SALOONS
WILL HAVE TO CLOSE
DISCRIMINATOR KRUTTSCHNITT
CARRIES HIS POINT.
Southern Pacific Directors Pass an
Order Which Makes Their Man
ager a Censor of Morals
and Collector of Dimes.
Yesterday afternoon the board of direc
tors of the Southern Pacific Company
held their regular weekly meeting and
definitely settled the matter of the now
celebrated liquor order. Notwithstanding
the opposition of the few fair-minded
members of the board the Huntington
push carried the day and succeeded In
having the matter placed entirely in the
hands of the discriminating Kruttschnitt.
This means that, with its usual regard
for the wishes of the business community,
t,he Southern Pacific has decided to ignore
entirely the protests and petitions which
have been presented to it by those mer
chants whose business is affected by the
Huntington reformatory order, and will
close up as many saloons along its lines
as it can without injuring Its own re-
ceipts.
The excuse given that the thirst of its
employes makes such an action necessary
is not only a reflection on the men who
handle its trains, but arrant nonsense,
from whatever standpoint it is viewed.
The whole matter is merely another
catch-penny device to turn into the al
ready overflowing coffers of the corpora
tion the few dimes that help to make a
living possible to those who conduct the
eating houses along the road.
Liquor will continue to be sold on the
dining and buffet cars and at such saloons
along the road as - are owned by those
whom the company, for one reason or an
other, desires to favor. -Trainmen who
long for a drink can get it as cheaply
and easily as ever.
The only people who will derive any
benefit from the order are the stockhold
ers whose annual receipts will be swelled
In exact proportion to the losses sustained
by those who have not sufficient pull to
succeed In remaining unmolested.

FELL THREE STORIES
I AND BROKE HIS SKULL
A False Step Plunged
Ado C. Jacob to
His Death.
â 
A.DOLPH C. JACOB of 1559 Pacific
street, a tin roofer employed by
the Forderer Cornice Works,
" was killed yesterday forenoon
by falling off the roof of a three-story
building en Jackson street, between

Jacob was engaged in putting on a
gutter pipe and missed his footing,
causing him to slide down the steep
roof, from which he fell into the yard.
The injured man was taken to the

soon after he reached that place. An
autopsy at the Morgue by Dr. Cag

GROCER'S CLERK MAY
HAVE BEEN MURDERED
THE recovery of the body of Max
Kabish, a young grocer's clerk,
from the bay near section 3 of
ii the seawall, yesterday morning,
gives rise to strong suspicions
that a murder has recently been com
mitted. According to the 'statements
of persons with whom the deceased
was most intimate, money and a valu
able watch may have been the motive
for a plot against young Kabish's life.
When last seen alive Kabish had both
m his possession, was sober, and so far
as is known had no possible cause for
self-destruction. He disappeared early
on the morning of July 7, and yester
day his corpse was found floating in
the bay. decomposed beyond recogni
tion.
When the Coroner brought the body
to the Morgue a cameo ring with a
Greek head and helmet and bearing on
the inside the inscription "M. Kabish,
S. F., Cal., 1893," remained on one fin
ger. In the clothes of the clerk were
found a 10-cent piece, a bunch of keys,
a constitution and by-laws of the
Llllenthaler Verein, and a broken
watch chain, with the timepiece miss
ing. â¢ . ; :; â¢.'."'.' ..v-'...- ; '.-^.;-;--'-
The identity of the corpse was estab
lished by the ring and chain; also by the by-laws of the verein, which he
had joined but one week previous to his disappearance. H. Larsen. residing
at 706 Mason street, was the first to' make the Identification positive. He stat
ed to the Coroner that a watch should be among the recovered effects. He
also said that he had personally purchased a fine gold watch, costing /Â§7G,
for Kabish some time ago and that the latter had it when last seen by his
friends. He further stated that the deceased had money and was to depart
for Eureka, where he had secured a position as hotel clerk, a couple of days
after the Fourth. When he disappeared his intimates thought he had taken his
contemplated trip. \ Larsen - was followed by several other persons, who sub
stantiated his statement and who believe that their friend has been the vic
tim of foul play. . .
Henry ' Droge. a grecery clerk at the corner of Post and Jones streets,
was a constant companion to Kabi3h. He left the latter early on the morn
ing of July 5 in a bowling alley on Ellis street, and at that time Kabish had
about $50 in his possession and his gold watch. He was happy and talked
much of his prospective trip. He was never at any time out of money, and
Droge laughs at the insinuation that his friend committed suicide.
Kabish was last see*, in Seeba & Bohlen's saloon, corner of Merchant and
Kearny streets, about 1:30 on the morning of July 7. He shook dice with the
bartender and paid for the drinks when he lost. He seemed to have money,
and according to the bartender's story was never broke and never drank to
excess. He was In the habit of dropping In the place about that time every
morning and always produced cash. On the occasion of his last visit he had
possession of his watch and was very cheerful. The other witnesses talked
with Kabish at intervals on the Fourth and all agree that he had his watch,
and so far as they knew money. â  . j .. -! v
The theory is that Kabish was foully dealt with, his watch and money
taken from him and his body thrown into the bay. There is no known reason
why he should commit suicide, and many circumstances point to murder. The
police are working on the case. The body \is so far in a state of decomposi
tion that it Is almost impossible to tell whether or not there are marks of Vio
lence on it.
Kabieh stopped at the Humboldt House, 1309 Stockton street. He disap
peared from there about July 4, and his trunk still remains in the house. He
paid his bills regularly and owes the house nothing.

the Transport Para and Was Not Arrested.
Statement of His Intended Victim.
Â«.. .SOft ordering a colored soldier to
' â _ be less boisterous yesterday after
| noon Policeman Silver of the Cali-
Jj fornia-street station narrowly
escaped being made a subject for
the Coroner.
Silver was standing at the corner of
Pacific and Sansome streets when his at
tention was attracted to four colored sol
diers who were creating a disturbance.
The officer accosted them and asked them
to move on. One of them challenged his
right to interfere with them and threat
ened to blow his head off. The soldier
was armed with a Jorgensen rifle and as
he attempted to use it his comrades seized
him and started to drag him away.
'.' i.inking that they intended to leave the
scene without further trouble Silver
crossed the street, after advising the com
rades of the vicious trooper to take him
to the transport which they intended to
board and which was to carry them and
the rest of the colored warriors to Manila.
As Silver crossed the street the desperate
soldier, after breaking away from nis
comrades, raised his rifle to his shoulder
and with an oath he fired point blank at
the policeman. The bullet passed in dan
gerous uroximity to Sliver's head and he
quickly "reached for his revolver.
Before he had a chance to return the
fire the murderous soldier, followed by his
comrades, ran down Pacific street. Silver
â¢started after them, and after a run of
several blocks he was joined by Police
man McGee. who had been attracted to
the scene bj the shooting. Together they
pursued the quartet, hoping to head them
off before they boarded the transport

the wharf first, however, and straight
IMPROVED RED MEN
RAISE UP CHIEFS
IN FRESENCE OF MANY FADE-
FACES.
An Interesting Ceremony Last Night
in the Assembly Hall of the
Odd Fellows' Building.
Ninety-six elected chiefs, representing
sixteen" tribes of the Improved Order of
Red Men of the hunting grounds of San
Francisco, were "raised up" in public last
night in the assembly hall of the Odd
Fellows' building in the presence of more
than 2000 people.
The acting great chief who conducted
the ceremony of raising up, which in oth
er orders is called installation, was assist
ed o. the owing named district depu
ties "who filled the positions opposite their
names: Thomas Roche, great chief; F. B.
Swan, great senior sagamore; M. L.
Wheeler, great junior sagamore; U. A.
Lewis, great prophet; L. L. Remy, great
chief of records; P. C. Blick. great keeper
of wampum; J. Fowzer, great sannap; H.
L. Stacy, great mishinewa; P. Bellegarde,
great guard of wigwam.
The hall was decorated with rare good
taste and the center of it had been ar
ranged after the fashion of a council
chamber, with the council fire in the mid
dle. The several great chiefs took their
several stations after the kindling of the
council fire and smoking of the pipe of
peace in due fcrm and proceeded with the
ceremonies. The elected chiefs were es
corted into the hall six abreast and pre
sented at the station of the great chief,
who addressed them according to the rit
ual of the order.
The. ceremony was in the amplified
form, in which the great chief of a partic
ular 'rank delivers the charges to those
chiefs in the same rank in the subordinate
councils. These were raised up in the fol
lowing order: Prophets, keepers of wam
pum, chiefs of records, junior sagamores,
senior sagamores and sachems. Each
great chief had his work memorized, and
the charges were all delivered in an im
pressive manner, but notably so by
the great prophet. The ceremonies con
cluded with the proclamation of raising
up and the quenching of the council fire
by members of Manzanita Tribe.
Among Interested spectators who were
on the stage were the following members
of the Great Council of California: George
W. Collins, great sachem; F. D. Brandon,
great junior sagamore; C. F. Burgmann,
great chief of records; XV. J. Smith, great
keeper of wampum; Porter L. Bliss, great
sannap. and P. <i. Seymour, great guard
of the wigwam, and Past Great Sachems
B. F Josselyn, W. M. Betts, H. S. Winn,
James G. Smith, Frederick Brandt and
George XV. Lorie.
Then followed a programme of ten num

men were only a few feet behind them,
and as they attempted to board the trans
Â§ort they were stopped by the sentries,
liver hurriediv explained that one of the
colored troopers had attempted to mur
der him and that he intended to arrest ,
him. The sentries refused to allow him
to board the vessel, and threatened to
run a ba%-onet Into him if he did not move
on. Silver appealed to a lieutenant of
the regiment to allow him to board the |
transport, after informing him of the at
tempt of the colored private to assassi- l
nate him. After considerable hesitancy j
the lieutenant finally permitted him to
board the vessel and arrest his assailant I
If he could identify him.
The officer searched the transport but
could get no trace of the murderous sol
dier. He believes that he was hidden
away by his comrades. After searching
the vessel in vain, Silver visited police
headquarters and made a written report
of the occurrence to hief Lees. In it he
said that the man who took a shot at
him was creating a disturbance and he
cautioned him to be quiet. The desperate
soldier then proceeded to abuse him and
threatened to fill him "with holes" if he
attempted to arrest him.
Silver again advised him to be quiet and
started to ..-alk away just as his com
rades proceeded to drag the soldier down
the street.
"Thinking that they intended to leave
the vicinity," remarked the policeman
when telling the story to Captain Witt
man, "I crossed the street, when sudden
ly 1 heard a shot and felt a bullet whiz
past my head. I quickly turned around
and saw the murderous soldier again
raise his rifle to his shoulder. I reached
for my revolver, but before I had a
chance to use it he and his companions
ran down the street and disappeared
aboard the transport. I did not nre at
him as I feared that I might kill one of
his comrades."

DEATH ENDS A LONG
JOURNEY AFTER HEALTH
Earl Stickle, a Well Known News-
paper Man of This City, Suc
cumbs to Consumption.
Earl Stickle, well known among the
newspaper fraternity of this city and of
Denver, died unexpectedly Wednesday in
the Adirondack Mountains, New York. Mr.
Stickle commenced his newspaper work in
Denver, where he acquired a ready, grace
ful style. He came to this city some sev
en years since and became a member of
the Chronicle staff.
His work attracted the attention of his
employer, who made him New York rep
resentative of the paper. He proved a
model correspondent In his new field, hav
ing the Intuition of a trained newspaper
man and showing extreme skill in the
handling of stories. His gonial disposition
gained many friends for him ln the East
ern metropolis. Consumption, the grim
destroyer, had him In its grasp, however,
and he was forced to abandon his work
and seek a more genial clime. He was
succeeded as representative of the Chroni
cle by M. J. Egan. who returned from
Manila, whither he had gone with the
United States troop*. v ?~-
Mr. Stickle went first to the Adiron
dacks, but this afforded him no relief.
Last December he was in this city, going
later to Phoenix. Ariz. In May he went
to Denver, but the altitude proved too
high, and he again returned to the Adlr
ondacks. The journey proved his undo
ing, however, and he died the night after
his arrival. He leaves a widow, who cared
for him unceasingly in all his journeylngs
after the elusive phantom of health.

"THE LAST WORD" A SUCCESS
â * â
BLANCHE BATES WAS IN HER
HAPPIEST VEIN.
â¦
Home-Coming of Company Marked
With Cordial Greeting From a
Well-Pleased Audience - and
a Speech.
"Well, I've brought her back," said Mr.
Frawley when, after the first act of "The
Last Word," a half-dozen curtain calls
made a speech Imperative. In fact he
has brought them all back and a few
more to outstretched hands and a most
cordial welcome. Could anything more
happily follow an enthusiastic greeting
than Miss Bates' initial speech in the
play, "l think I'm pretty well acquainted
already!" , We, are tremendously sincere
in our likes and Miss Bates is one of our
constancies.
. Is it safe to set eight-course dinners
before a public semi-invalided on a year's
liberal soft diet of dramatic gruels and
simples? We're Just perverse enough,
though, to grow convalescent and wax
fat on them and face our inevitable win
ter starvation with the appetites of
wolves. We have Mr. Miller's company,
we have Mr. Morrison and Miss Roberts,
and now Mr. Frawley brings us a strong
company well worthy of applause. It
lacks but one thing and that is a Frank
Worthing. Miss Bates, Mr. Frawley. Mr.
Hickman, Mr. Cook are old favorites.
The play, too,. is old, yet ever new. If
you have in you a touch of the concern
of the philosopher, for the race you will
see In It a dramatized human grievanceâ
the man Who devotes his life to. guarding
his integrity, as an autocrat, consuming
much happiness and producing nothing,
knowing nothing, feeling ' nothing but
tyranny He is common enough in our
midst, "well fed, tight listed, self-approv
ing, bearing the experience of age but
not a whit of the experience of life. You
can never affix the exact moral tag to his
kind, but you know it is shocking bad
form for him to continue to live. God
pity the world if his dominion were com
plete. Atop of this heaviness come tne
dancing rhythms of the Baroness Bora
neff of the world, who run you Into sun
shine at -the point of the bayonet,. if. need
be Miss Bates' Baroness has grown per
ceptibly in dramatic strength.
It is ever Russian with never a slip of
the tongue.- If I were asked her distinct
ive qualification , I should say tempera
ment It overflows her most effortless
successes : and makes of Vera the very
woman the author had in mind. The au
dience paid a fitting tribute, to her abillty
and in a graceful little speech she easily
expressed her gratitude. Mr. Hickman is
always good and he finds Alexander Airy
an easy vehicle for his talent. Mr. Cooke
as the secretary was most acceptable, ex
cept at the close of the third act. The
climax was one of mistaken vehemence.
The step from amateur to professional is
a long one and Mr. Mathleu does not take
it gracefully, at least not as Boras Bora
neff for he plays, the part rather stiffly - ,
with an unmistakable German accent. Of
the new people, Miss Mould was especially
winning. Without challenging our ap
proval she walked Into it most securely,
and I don't believe she knew it. either.
The role of Faith Rutherell is not a grate
ful one, and so let us reserve our judg
ment of Miss VanÃUren until we see her
again. Mr. Frawley and his company are
worthy our applause and suppport. 'Our
plaudits they have won. We shall speak
that .'last word,' Brave allâ done!

TIVOLrS "BLUE BEARD."
The premier of the'Tlvoll's summer bur
lesque, "Blue Beard," attracted a large
audience to the theater last evening, and
when the curtain fell on the last act the
general verdict of all present was that
the production was one of the most suc
cessful seen at the theater in many years.
There Is a pleasing J freshness in every
part of the production, the lines are up
to date, the most popular music is in
corporated and the costumes and scenic
effects are ln , keeping. . .The entire com
pany was accorded an ovation at the end
of each act, and as for the encores, they
were demanded until the actors -. were
tired out. Edwin Stevens, William Pru
ette, Georgle Cooper, , William Schuster,
Annie Myers, Charlotte Beckwith. Phil
Branson and Ada Palmer Walker and the
rest : of the company made Individual
"hits" with their. songs, jokes and dances,
and the box office of the Tlvoli is likely
to do a rushing business during "the time
that "Blue Beard" is kept in the bills.

novelty, and their dances last evening
were redemanded by the audience . over

Thus declared J. Cavassacook, a sec

DARING EASTERN CROOK
LOCKED UP IN THE TANKS
Broke Into Several Residences and
Got Away With Plunder.
Billy Page, a Noted Housebreaker, Arrested by the
Detectives in a Bush-Street Lodging-House.
Stolen Jewelry Found in His Room.
LOCKED up In the tanks of the City
Prison is a desperate Eastern
crook who the police think Is re
, 1 Q sponsible for at least a half-dozen
burglaries committed" In the "West
ern Addition. His name is William Page,
and according to the police he is known
as one of the most daring burglars in the
country.
During the past week Captain of De
tectives Bohen has received several com
plaints concerning the bold operations of
Page. In nearly every case the desperate
housebreaker succeeded in gaining an en
trance by prying open a window with a
jimmy. Last Sunday night he entered a
house on Sutter street, near Scott, and
got away with a quantity of jewelry and
silverware. The jimmy which he used in
forcing open the window through which
he entered was found in the garden, where
it had evidently been dropped by him.
Realizing that he had an unusually suc
cessful burglar to deal with. Captain Bo
hen detailed Detectives Gibson. Wren.

RESIDENTS PETITION
FOR COOP'S DISCHARGE
BELVEDERE LAUD CO.'S SUPER
INTENDENT NOT POPULAR.
The water troubles of Belvedere are now
an old story, but the troubles of John
Coop, the superintendent of the Belve
dere Land Company, have just com
menced and will probably end in Coop's
dismissal.
It is now nearly two weeks since the
wells of the city among the hills refused
to work, and during that time the best
that the fashionable residents have been
able to get in the way of water has been
a dry shampoo.
They bore their misfortune until pa
tience became a weakness, and yesterday
they concluded that it was time to take
some decided action. The action has re
sulted in a petition, got up by E. J. Benja
man, which sets forth the unhappy con
dition of things and prays the Belvedere
Land Company to remove its superin
tendent, John Coop, and place some one
in charge of Its affairs who is both com
petent and willing, to discharge the du
ties he is paid to perform.
Though the petition appeared only yes
terday morning it met with such popular
approval that thirty-four signatures were
secured before the early boat reached the
city. It is thought that when it is pre
sented to the company only three of the
entire population will not" have their
names attached to it, and these three
are in favor of the movement and are
only restricted by business and social
reasons from openly indorsing it.
The residents of Belvedere claim that
there is plenty of water on the island
and that did Coop properly attend to his
business such trouble as now exists would
not be possible.
The well that was dug last summer is.
they say, capable of supplying the en
tire place, let alone the four or rive others
that are available. But so little labor is
employed in the care of these sources of
supply that they amount to but little more
than caved-in sinkholes. Not only is the
lack of water a great Inconvenience and
discomfort, hut to the land owners of
Belvedere it assumes a much more seri
ous aspect when it causes the value of
their real estate to deteriorate and their
summer tenants to move back to their
homes on this side nt the bay.

efforts In locating him. Last Monday
evening they saw a man answering the
description of the much wanted burglar
walking along Grant avenue.
He was followed to a lodging-house, on
BOsh street, and as he entered his room
the detectives followed him. : ' ':
He was closely questioned and as he fre
quently contradicted himself the detec
tives concluded to search his room. In a
bureau drawer they found several articles
of jewelry which had been stolen from a
residence in the Western Addition. A
"jimmy" and a bunch of skeleton keys
were also discovered in his apartments.
Page was then placed under arrest and
taken to the City Prison, where his name
was registered on the small book. To
day the detectives expect to have suffi
cient evidence to warrant them in placing
several charges of burglary against him.
Page, so the police think, was accompa
nied in his midnight raids by another
crook, who is also well known in the
East. The detectives are looking for him
and are confident of having him in the.
