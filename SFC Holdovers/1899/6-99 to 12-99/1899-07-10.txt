The anti-Semite journals connect the
story with the Dreyfus affair. It ap
pears that about a fortnight ago, Fig

of documents destroyed, declaring that

YDA ADDIS TRIES
TO TAKE LIFE
ALMOST A MURDERESS
YDA ADDIS STORKE.
This notorious woman made an attempt to kill Attorney Grant Jack
son at Santa Barbara yesterday.
SANTA BARBARA. July Yda
Addis Storke, who became noto
rious through, the libel suit
brought against her by the county
for having written anonymous let
ters attacking Dr. Winchester and cer
tain women,- npw appears " before the
"public in the role of a would-be mur
deress. Attorney Grant Jackson, at
one time her best friend, but who
grained her enmity by testifying- against
her in the libel suit, was the intended
victim.
This morning at about 3 o'clock Mrs.
StorkÂ» went to Jackson's house with the
intention of "finishing him up," as she
expressed it. but her attempt was un
successful. She gained entrance to a.
! bedroom through the window on the
southeast side of the house by cutting a
screen. once in the house she sat down
on a bed to arrange her plans. First she
opened the hand satchel she brought
with her and took out a four-ounce bot
tle of chloroform, a bottle of prussic
acid, and a bottle of cyanide acid and
carefully arranged them on the bed.
Then she selected the chloroform bot
! tle, and carrying with it some bunting.
which she had in the valise, she walked
cautiously into Jackson's room.
The would-be murderess stooped over
the sleeping form and arranged the
chloroform bottle in such a. position
that her arm would not tire before her
work was accomplished. The piece of
bunting -touched - Jackson's ' nose and
aroused him. but he merely turned rest
lessly on his couch" and again fell
asleep. He was aroused a second time
by the same tickling sensation and sat
up. He saw the woman standing over
him and asked:
"Who are you?"
"It's me. Grant," Mrs. Storke replied.
"Have you a gun?"
Jackson said that he had. Mrs. Storke
drew a revolver from the folds of her
! dress and Jackson was commanded to
hand over his weapon, Mrs. Storke say
: ing she "had the drop" on him. He
obeyed the command, He asked the
woman what she wanted there at that
time of the night. She exclaimed:
"That's my business. Don't talk too
loudâ you will awaken the rest of the
! house."
They entered into conversation and
Jackson attempted to divert her atten
-1 tion. He watched for an opporunity to
i seize her, but she kept him covered with
; the revolver. Finally his chance came.
1 She reached for her handkerchief which
la-- on the floor, and he instantly
sprang upon her. They grappled. for
ten minutes before Jackson overpower
ed her. He tied both hands behind her
back. Then he called E. Tallant. a
neighbor, who summoned an officer,
and Mrs. Storke was placed under ar
rest. She begged Jackson on her knees
not to arrest her. assuring him that she
would pay him a large sum of money if
he would let her go. She was taken to
GREAT INDIAN POWWOW AT
WINNEBAGO RESERVATION
CHICAGO, July 9.â A special to the Times-Herald from Decatur,
Neb., says: The greatest Indian powwow in recent years began at the
Omaha Winnebago Indian reservation to-day. It is heM at Yellow
Smoke's lodge, five milea north of Deeatur. A great many Indians have
already pitched their tents and great preparations are being made for a
two weeks' celebration. The Indians of the reservations of Northern Ne
braska have been arranging for this .sreat event for months. The chief
tains gave it out to th>- whites that the celebration â¢ this year would
eclipse anything attempted by the Omaha and Winnebago tribes during
the last quarter of a century.
The traditional rites and ceremonies of these ancient tribes will be
Performed. If not prohibited by the authorities, the ' savage war dance
will be indulged in as a grand finale. The chieftains say the evpnt will
draw together no fewer than 5000 Indians.
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
f the County Jail and a warrant for at
| tempt to murder was served. "When In
terviewed she said:
"I have nothing to say. I merely
went to Jackson's room because I knew
! I would find him in a better mood and
| then could talk to him undisturbed. I
i went through the window because I
' have been accustomed to enter that
way. as I have been in the house a
number of times and at all hour's of the
night. The chloroform T had with me
i on account of heart trouble and why I
carry the other articles is nobody's bus
: mess."
Jackson's story is different. During
'â  the conversation at his bedside he ask
j ed why sh^ was th-=>re and she answer-
I ed:
"I am herp to kill you and then com-
I mit suicide; so don't be in a rushâ
! we've both got to go."
"She asked me for my pistol, which
': T handed to her," said Jackson. "I fin
ally succeeded in striking up a conver
! sation and branched off on to another
subject altogether. She has prowled
around the house very often, but
; never seemed desperate in any way. I
saw my chance to grab her. 1 tied her
i hands and threw her on th<Â» bed and
j called for Bd Tallant, a neighbor. In
< the meantime she turned over, seized a
revolver with both hands and discharg
ed it, the bullet going through the floor.
I An officer came and she was placed un
der arrest."
A number of persons have believed
. themselves in danger since the trial for
libel, and the attack upon Jackson will
result in a vigorous attempt being made,
to place Mrs. Storke behind the walls of
San Quentin.
Km. Storke was to have been sen
tenced in the Superior Court to-morrow
for criminal libel. When Mrs. Storke
was searched at the jail she was found
to have a second revolver with her.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY. July 9.â |
Dr. John C. Brauner and his scientific,
expedition have arrived safely at Per- |

tnlned In letters from Dr. Brauner. Ho '
writes that the party sailed from New
York on the -Ist of May and reached Per
nambuco on June S. At the time of writ
ing he was doing his best to get the out
fit through the Brazilian Custom-house.
Dr. Brauner says Pernambuco has not

erican activity.

Arthur W. Grreley.C. F. Oilman. P.ay Col
lins, B. H. Collins and Harold Havens, all
students of Stanford University.
The expedition was sent to Brazil to ex- j
plore the remarkable coral and sand- |
Btone reefs of that region and settle some ;
of the questions in regard to their for- j
mation that have puzzled the leading bel- .
fentlsts of the day. The roofs are off the
Brazilian coast, beginning at Abrolnoa ;
'Island near Rio Janeiro, and extending j
northward a distance of 1400 miles to ( ape I
St. Koque. , .
Dr. Itrauner writes that the party has ,
engaged a vessel at Pernambuco and will .
leave about tne 12th for the reefs. The
whole party is reported to be in good >
health. l:.- work on the reels 1? expected
to last about two months and will con
sist of a careful study and mapping of
the reef and coast lines and the collection ,
of specimens for the Harvard and Stan
ford museums. The sandstone reefs are :
from a few feet to a thousand feet from j
the ore line and parallel to it. forming I
a protection from th* waves and supply- â 
ing where the water Is deep enough a j
pale anchorage for vessels.
The coral reefs are further from the \
Shore. The controversy In regard to their j
formation Is Interesting, Th. theory of j
the famous scientist Darwin is that ,
coral formations are not found at great
depths but thai they have grown up I
from land which was once near or above I
the surface of the water and which has |
gradually sunk with the ages. On the
other hand. Murray., a famous British i
scientist, who sailed around the world
with the Challenger expedition â  few
years ago. contends that they have grown
only from ridges of land under water
which were never at any great depth. It
is to arrive at the truth In regard to the
corals that Dr. Brauner is exploring the
reef?.
The expedition is conducted under the
support of Professor Agassis of Harvard
University and the data gathered will be
published' by that university. Dr. Brauner |
will use some Of it in completing a. work
on coral formations, which he began
while In Brazil during the seventies, when

BRILLIANT BALL

Ludlow's Function Well
Attended.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
HAVANA. July The reception and
ball last evening Riven by General Lud- ;
low, military commander, outshone every â¢
other social function In Havana in recent |
years. Innumerable red. white and blue
electric lights, thousands of roses, hun
dreds of flags and no end of sabers, bayo
nets and rifles, artistically grouped . made .
the scene within the palace memorable.
More than a thousand guests attended.
Music was furnished by two military
bands. All the foreign Consuls were In at
tendance, most of them wearing glitter
ing orders, and many of the women dis
played handsome jewels. General Ludlow
gave the function in honor of Independ
ence .Day, and the representative Cubans
and Spaniards of Havana were present.
American officials here are surprised
at the large number of Cubans now ap
plying in the province of Santiago for a
share of the American gratuity. The Cu
ban officers had assured them that there
were not a hundred men In the province
who would accept money from the United
States, basing tiie assurance on tele
grams which purported to come from
Santiago. Even when it became known
that tnese dispatches were inspired by [
Cuban malcontents here, and concocted
in the Inglaterra Cafe, it was still felt
that these opponents of a rational solu
tion of the Cuban army question might
be able to prevent a large number from
applying to the American paymasters.
Those who knew the facts of the case be
lieved that the Santiago insurgents were
much underestimated on the payrolls, es
pecially as the Cuban generals had al
ways claimed that more than CO per cent
of 'the army was in Santiago province.
It turns out that the jealousy that ex
isted in war times between the eastern
and western troops still exists, and that
those in Santiago Province are more like
ly to reject than accept advice from Ha-
V A?*Banctl Splrltus. out of ISO men mus

TWENTY-SEVEN BCYS
BREAK FOR LIBERTY
Populist Reform School Superinten

OMAHA July 9.â A Bee special from
Plankinton. B. D.. says: The recent
change. In th.-- management of the State
Reform School here, whereby T. H.
TompkJns, a Populist, was put in charge
Instead of a Republican, was made the
occasion for a mutinous outbreak on the
part of the inmates. The trouble occurred
on Saturday and has caused the manage
ment a good deal of uneasiness. The boys
were out on the campus playing hall when
the order was given to fall In line and
inarch back to the building. The young
sters refused point blank and took to
their heels, the shouts of the new super
intendent having no effect upon them.
The guards were at once called and the
Sheriff was called and all joined in the
pursuit. . ,
Twenty-seven boys got away from the
Rounds, and after a long and heatea
chase extending into the flight, all were
caught and brought back except two, a
Norwegian and a big Indian, who are still
at large. On their way ha... the boys
made slurring remarks about the new
"Pop" superintendent and averred that
they had planned to make the break for
liberty with the change of management.

Special Dispatch to The Call. -
DETROIT, July 9.â Although a large
majority of the army of Christian En- j
doav.orers in Detroit utilized the street ,
cars to-day, a considerable portion re- j
framed from reading the Sunday news
papers. Few of the pastors who occupied
the various pulpits went to the" extreme ;
of inconveniencing themselves by walking ,
long distances; as did Rev. Charles M.
Sheldon, author of "In Ills Steps," who \
walked' more than three mile* to preach
from the text "One Is our master; all we ;
are brethren" to a congregation which en
tirely exceeded the capacity of Bethany
Presbyterian Church. Mr. Sheldon spoke â 
optimistically of the signs of the times, ,
especially the awakening of the social con- j
science, with better relationship between
employers and employed; federation of j
the church movement toward civic right- ;
eousness, and an awakening to the stew- j
ardship feature of the Christian life, as to
his money, time and talents.
The features of the afternoon were
crowded meetings for men and women
exclusively and a Sabbath observation j
rally. Thirty-five hundred men filled the
floor and galleries of the Light Guard arm- |
ory at the men's meeting. The men sang
with enthusiasm, and a very large propor- ,
tion publicly pledged that the occasion
would be witn them a landmark from
which would date a better life. Secretary
Baer conducted the meeting and Rev. Dr. i
J. Wilbur Chapman of New York preached
from Job. xvlii:18: "Ye shall be driven
from light into darkness and be chased
out of the world," the theme brought out
being the fate of the persistent sinner as
compared with that of the godly.
Mrs. P. E. Clark, wife of President
Clark, presided over the women's meet- i
Ing, which tilled the Woodward avenue
Baptist Church. Mrs. Joseph Walker of
Queensland. Australia, led the devotional
service. The programme of addresses was
as follows: "'The Women of Mexico,"
Mrs. C. Scott Williams, San Luis Potosi,
â¢Mexico; "The Women of China," Miss
Caroline E. Chlttenden, Foochow, China;
'The Women of Asia," Miss Jessie Ack
erman. Chicago; "Woman's Work for Her
Country," Mrs. Howard M. Ingham, Jet
ferson," Ohio. I
Westminster Presbyterian Church could !
not contain the audience which attended j
the Sabbath observance gathering. An ,
address upon "Sabbath in the Home was
delivered by Rev. Dr. David McAllister
of Allegheny, Pa. He held the religious
development of the family to be of the j
utmost Importance, the family being the
foundation of the civil structure and th*
cornerstone of the temple of worship.
Said he:
"We cannot carry on our civilization nor
keep our young people to the front unless
they are trained in Sabbath-Keeping j
Rev. C N. Howard of Rochester, N. V.,
related at length the story of some al
leged futile attempts made in that city
toward Closing the "side door on bun
davs. He. argued insistently that prohi
bition is the only true solution for th?
saloon question. The closing speech was
made by Hon. John Charlton M. P., of
Lvnedoch Ontario, ."What the Sabbath
May Do for Vs." The speaker's idea was
thai Sabbath observance bad a far more
potent influence in character building and
world development than had commonly j
been conceded in later years. ; -
To-night an additional touch of solem
nity was Imparted to the meetings of tho
Christian End.-avorers. The generalities) :
of religion were in' some measure n^g- !
lected and the evening worship in thirty
one Protestant churches of Detroit and
Windsor took the form of consecration
services. - ,
The participants In these unostentatious
but Impressive services seemed to b3
striving, to make a direct personal appli- j
cation of the tenets of their faiths; many
were the pledges of more exalted efforts
for the coming year and more earnest
Christian service. The capacity of the
churches was taxed, and the rapt atten
tion of the crowds to the one subject of
consecration was Impressive in tho great
est degree. ...
President Francis E. Clark conducted
the consecration services in the wood
ward-avenue Baptist Church.
The big- convention will end to-morrow
night. There will be Junior Endeavor and
missionary rallies In each of the bif
tents a prison work conference and great
farewell gatherings in conclusion.
SUBSISTS FOR WEEKS
ON GRASS AND ROOTS
The Sufferings of a Prospector Lost
in the Mountains Near Roafl-*
land.
SPOKANE, July After having b*en
lost in the mountains nearly three weeks,
with nothing but leaves, grass and root?

MAY CULL THE
PLENARY COUNCIL
American Archbishops
to Consider It.
AN IMPORTANT ASSEMBLAGE
â #
NEARLY TWENTY YEARS SINCE
ONE WAS HELD.
Archbishop Keane Has Left Rome
and Will Arrive in Washington
â¢ in October â Mgr. Martinelli
Is Coming West. ..
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, July 9.â Tt. is said at
the residence of the Apostolic Delegate
that the reports emanating in the West
that a plenary council of the Catholic
church in America would be held two
years hence are doubtless the outgrowth
of the well-known fact that these coun
cils are held about every twenty years,
and that two years hence will. mark the
twenty-year period from the time of the
plenary council of Baltimore, held in '1882.
The assembling of such a council is' an
event of unusual Importance to the
church, as it brings together the entire
hierarchy of Archbishops and Bishops to
frame the legislation of the church appli
cable to this country. Before it can be
held, however, there must be a due de
termination by the authorities in the
countries, then directions from Rome for
the assembling of the council. Prior to
the council of Baltimore the American
Archbishops made a visit to Rome and
petitioned the Vatican for the assembling
of the coifncil. This procedure is not es
sential, though some such formal action
is required, and In case a council Is to be
held In -1902 It is thought the coming meet
ing of the American Archbishops which is
to be held in Washington next October
might consider the matter and frame a
petition to the Vatican. It is not known,
however, whether such a plan is being se
riously considered by the prelates, ' and
the report from the West Is said to be a
conjecture which may or may not prove
true. Except that plenary councils are
held every twenty years and there is a
desire to make this the established period
for their assembling, there is said to be
no special occasion for such an Important
convocation of church authorities.
The question of "Americanism." which
has excited much attention, has been din
posed of finally by the letter of the Pope,
and it Is said this is not a subject which
could come before a plenary council. The
condition of the church in Cuba and other
Spanish-American countries is working
out satisfactorily, and it is said this
would not require attention from a coun
cil, particularly as the Cuban. Porto
Rlcan and Philippine churches are still
outside of the American hierarchy. For
this reason the new Archbishop of San
tiago will not be present at the coming
meeting of American Archbishops, nor
will other branches of the Spanish-Amer
ican churches be represented. Thus far
the American church authorities have
been given no duties in connection with
the church in Cuba. Porto Rico and the
Philippines, the affairs there being direct
ed through apostolic delegates reporting
directly to Rome.
The new Apostolic Delegate to Canada,
Archbishop Franconia is well known to
the church authorities here, and the ap
pointment is regarded as an important
one, owing to the position of the church
in public affairs in Canada, particularly
in the province of Quebec. Archbishop
Franconia was brought up in Allegheny.
Pa., and for some time was connected
with the Franciscan fraternity there.
Later he was Vicar General at St. Johns,
N. P... thence going to Rome and being
advanced to a high place near the Pope.
1 His former residence in this country is
: relied tipon to make his administration
in Canj.'da an auspicious one.
Archbishop Keane has started from
Rome for this country, but hr will pro
ceed slowly, making frequent visits on I
the continent,- and not reaching Washing
ton before October. â¢ i
Mgr. Martinelli. the Apostolic Delegate, |
will go to the. summer school at Madison. |
Wis., the latter part of this month, and i
will make several other visits in the i
West. " ;

JONES NOT OUT FOR

that will enable them to anchor down a
port cf entry into the Klondike gold fields
and all the other parts of the country
thereabouts where concessions are looked
for are of little importance compare.. j
with the Lynn Canal territory, which is
the key to the situation. ;
Senator Fairbanks, when interviewed, j
placed importance on the fact that he
must sit with the Joint High Commission
in August, but declined to state what
lines of argument he would take Up. He
expressed great satisfaction at having
made the trip. Regarding boundary mat
trrs that were discussed during the four
weeks spent in Alaska, Senator Foster
declined to speak. â¢ â  â 
"Personally," he said, "1 am opposed to
yielding an "lnoh of United States terri
tory. A careful Investigation, however,
demonstrates that there may be different
constructions placed upon the treaties in
volved as regards channels, the situation
of lesser islands and the like. But. in the
main the United States is plainly given
a strip of territory north of Portland
Canal, or thereabouts, ten marine leagues
inland except where a well-defined moun
tain range places the boundary nearer the
coast This strip runs up to Mount St.
Ellas Many contend at the passes that
the watershed back of Skaguay and Dyea
is the dividing line. On the one side are
the headwaters of the Yukon and on tne
other the streams flowing into Lynn
Canal are formed. Between these two
districts these is a chain of mountains, ;
thus, in the opinion of some, bringing the
boundary line some eighteen miles nearer
the coast. This seems to be a fair ex
pression of the American view of the
boundary question. By this construction
of the treaty it is held that England will !
receive the benefit of every point that can
be fairly and honestly granted. On the j
other hand, however, the Canadians and |
many of the Englishmen hold that the <
boundary should be drawn thirty miles
or ten marine leagues inland from the j
headlands. By such a construction, of |
course. Lynn Canal would be an inlet !
into Canadian territory and ten marine j
leagues inland from the headlands at the |
entrance would be many miles south of I
Skaguay and Dyea, and hence Canada and :
England would"" have the coveted port of I
entry without a question of doubt. As ,
I look at It. personally, the Lynn Canal Is
Â» part of the sea or ocean. Therefore it |
would be unfair to draw a lino thirty i
miles inland from the headlands at the ;
entrance to bodies of water of that na- i
ture and call it the boundary under the j
treaty. " .â¢â '-â -'

ment to such rule Baron yon Sternberg,
German representative on the Samoan
Commission, has again supported the po

the commission were nearly wrecked by
the declaration of the German Govern
ment that under the treaty of Berlin three
Consuls had to be unanimous before ac
i tion could be taken, and this rule, it was
! declared, should be pursued in the de
i liberations of the commission.
The United States and Great Britain
desired that majority rule should prevail
in the commission, though the necessity
' of unity on the part of the three Consuls
i was admitted: but the German proposi
tion was finally adopted. The fact that
Baron yon Sternberg has agreed to ma

SUFFERERS
Governor Sayers Devises a
Method for the Distribu
tion of Supplies.
WATERS JET RISING
It Is Now Estimate! That the
Texas Crops Are Damaged to the
Extent of Forty Millions.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
AUSTIN, Tex., July 9. â Governor
Sayers spent the day at his office !
receiving reports from the num
erous committees which have j
charge of the work of rescuing ;
and distributing food supplies to the |
flood refugees. The Governor also re- j
ceived many contributions from Texas |
towns and individuals' of Eastern and
Northern cities to-day in behalf of the
destitute people. Blair & Company of
New York City, sent a draft for $500.
The situation is much more serious
than was Indicated a day or two ago.:
It is now fully realized that it is coins |
to be a big task to take care of the ;
homeless and needy until they can be I
provided with shelter and work. A plan ;
of action by which it is hoped an abun
dance of the necessary supplies can be
obtained was perfected by the Governor
to-day. It consists of the formation of :
districts each of which is composed of
counties that v. ere unaffected by the
flood and are contiguous to the inun
dated region. The county Judges in j
these districts were asked to call on j
the people of their respective counties j
for aid and forward the contributions
in the way [food and clothing to cer- ;
tified distributing points. j
The sea of water in Fort Bend, Waller, I
Brazoria and Austin counties did not |
recede to-day to any appreciable ex- j
t<=>nt. A telegram was received here |
this evening from Sandy Point, Bra- j
zoria County, stating that the water]
contlnuued to rise there all last night |
and this morning. Thousands of addi- ;
tional acres of cotton, sugar-cane and
corn were inundated and the property
loss greatly increased, according to re
liable information received from every \
county in the flooded districts during
the past two days.
The first estimates of the aggregate j
loss to the cotton yield will be exceeded ;
several times over. There is no longer
the slightest doubt that there have been \
fully 700.000 prospective bales of cotton \
swept out of existence. The actual loss
may exceed this estimate, when the real
condition of affairs in the bottoms be
come apparent. A careful calculation
made to-day by Judge N. A. Cravens, j
private secretary of Governor Sayers,
from the reports on file in that office
shows that the length of the overflowed
districts extends from McLennan Coun- â 
ty to the gulf in Brazorta County, a
distance of 325 miles. The average!
width of the overflowed bottom or val
ley of the Brazos River is about ten
miles. In some places the water cover
ed the rich agricultural land to a width j
of fifteen miles, while at other points
the width was not more than four
miles. Taking these conservative cal- ;
culations as a basis it will be seen that
the total number of square miles inun- ;
dated was 32,500 or nearly 21.000.000
acres. Estimating the cotton yield at |
only one ale per acre and the value of |
each bale at $20, and calculating that j
only twentieth of the inundated
district was planted in cotton, the loss
from that source alone is $20,000,000.
Estimating the loss to each acre of the
remaining 19.000.000 acres at $1 and the
total of $19,000,000 is obtained, which.
added to the cotton loss makes a grand
total of about 540,000,000.
It is claimed by those who have been
through the inundated region and j
viewed with their own eyes the terrible i
destructi'-n that has been wrought that j
the foregoing estimate is not any too ,
high. I
11. B. Eat<-n of Burleson County was
here to-day to buy provisions out of his
own private purse for the refugee ne
groes on his inundated plantation. He
says that all the planters of his section
who are so fortunate as to have a bank j
accc-unt are showing a generous' dispo- '
sition toward the destitute men, women
and children who were in their employ
when the flood cr.me. In explanation
of how it came about that there are so |
many waterbound negroes in the bot
toms. Mr. Eaton said:
"The- highest flood in the Brazos
River previous to this record-breaker
occurred over thirty years ago. Thej
valley of the stream was at that time j
comparatively sparsely settled and the j
loss of life and destruction of â¢
property was not so very great. i
All along the course of the river
might be seen markings to in- j
die ate the height reached by the flood
at that time. The negroes kepi outside j
the bounds of these high-water marks j
for many years, but finally began to J
grow careless and built their homes
nearer and nearer the river. When the â¢
present great rampage began hundreds ,
of negro families moved their livestock
and household effects above the old
high-water mark. They thought they
were safe there, but the waters contin
ued to come upward rapidly and before
the negroes were aware of their danger
the flood had risen many feet above the
high-water mark erf the last great flood i
and cut them off from all escape. They
then climbed trees, where they endured
from two to three days of untold suf
fering before rescue came."
Ninety-five per cent of the flood suf
ferers are negroes. By this it is not
meant those who suffered loss of crops,
but only those who are destitute of
clothing and shelter. There are many
thousands of well-to-do negroes in
Texas, but they have not responded to
the call for aid which has gone up from
thousands of destitute members of their J
race. The only contribution received I
from negroes by Governor Bayers is $10, j
which was raised by a local lodge here, j

Reports of Violence Said to Be a
Canard to Bolster Up the Claim
That Troops Are Yet Needed.
Special Plspatrh to The Call.
WALLACE, Idaho, July 9.â A
report gained some circula
tion yesterday that a number
of masked men had visited
several non-union miners at
Kurke on Friday night, and threatened
them with death if they did not leave
the country and that two men had
left because of such threats. These
men are said to have been Ellis Hale
and ..n enrineer named Wayne.
After a careful Investigation of this
report The Call correspondent can find |
but little to support it. The only fact |
tending to corroborate it is the '"~ap- j
pearanc of Hale. It is said, however,
that he had expressed an Intention to
leave a week ago. That masked men
could do any such thing as is claimed
seems impossible. A full company of
soldiers lias been stationed at Hr.rke.
and the town is thoroughly guarded.
The town rite I* situated in a canyon
barely wide enough for the two rail
road tracks which pass through it, and
in five minutes soldiers could traverse
the entire town. Citizens here do not
give any credence to the story, and
personal corroboration of it cannot be
found. One i <er says it is a canard
originated by the State authorities to
i...lster up their claim that the troops j
are still needed here. It would seem
the height of folly to attempt such in
timidation.
The struptde between th<> unions and
the mineowners Is now virtually noth
ing more than a game of freeze out. The
State authorities openly avow their In
tention to stamp out unionism in this
district, and union men seem doggedly
determined to flght it out to the end.
They have shown a disposition to obey
the edicts of the commanders of the
military, and in any event an attempt
to resort to violence would simply re
sult in the extermination of the miners.
They know this and seem to have
avoided a clash with the authorities
under trying circumstances in many
instances. On the other hand there
seems to be ground for the assertion
that union men are being run out of
the State.
Frank Shannon, a young man who

movement was started to have the mili

first Bteps in this movemeni was taken bj
the Shoshone County delegation in the
Legislature, all the members of which
we?e elected "n the miners union ticket.
This delegation, live In number, waited
on the Governor and earnestly requested
him to disband the militia He asked
his visitors whether he could depend upon
order being maintained In this section of
the State In the event of his acceding
to their request. They assured him very
Positively that it would contribute to the
interests ol law and order to have the,
military companies disbanded, because, as
they said the militiamen were an aggra
vatlng element in the community, likely.,
by their alleged insolence, to precipitate
trouble at any time. After talking over i
this feature of the subject some time â .
the Governor asked his visitors very
pointedly if they could assure him that
there would Vie no more outrages nk e the

was murdered In broad daylight while

was employed, and two other workmen
were run out of the country. The dele- '.

and he repeated It, and finally brought
forth the respon.se from one of the men
that It was a d)fferent kind of a matter, i
The Governor asked him to explain him- !

deserved to be removed. This statement
astounded the Governor, and lie asked |
why Kneebone deserved to b<* removed.!
He was told that it was because the mur- |
dered man had made himself obnoxious. I
"But how had he' made himself ol x
iuiis?" ask>-Â«l the Governor.
"Well, he talked against the union. He
declared that he could set along with
out belonging to the union."
"And do you mean to say," asked the
Governor, "that a man should be killed
who thus makes himself obnoxious, as i
you call it, to a portion of the commu

plainly slated that that was his meaning
The Governor appealed to each of the

CHILD VICTIM OF

Little Heler) Leersch) Bitten While
Playing in a Trenton
ParK-
TRENTON, N. J.. July 9.â Little Helen Leersch died at her home on
Second street early this morning, a victim of the kissing bug. Three phy
sicans have been in attendance. Little Helen's body was swollen to twice
its normal size before she died, and her symptoms were most unusual.
Accompanied by her parents. Helen went on Thursday ror an outing
in the city park. Owing to the heat Sirs. Leersch had dressed the child
in thin clothes and the girl's neck and arms were bare. While her father
and mother sat an a bench and chatted, Helen romped about, playing in
the shrubbery and on the lawns. Mrs. Leersch, when her little daugh
ter returned to complain that something hurt her. discovered several
bright red spots on the little one's arms and legs. The child's complex
ion was waxen, and after careful examination Dr. Griffith suspected that
ehe had been bitten by a kissing bug.
The little patient grew rapidly worse and Dr. Griffith decided to call
in r,-ther physicians to aid him in treating the extraordinary case. He re
lated the mother's statements about a black bug in the park, and the
three physicians, after further exam inntion of the rhiU's condition and
symptoms, agreed that they were those of a person who had been bitten
by a kissing bug. They decided that the situation was grave and ad
ministered medicines, both externally and internally, but without avail.
Her abdomen hardened and the blood became as thin as water. Before
death she was unconscious.

COMPTROLLER REQUESTED
TO REVIEW HIS DECISION
Letter to the Civil ServiCe Commis
sion to the Secretary of the
Treasury.
WASHINGTON, July 9. â The Civil
Service Commission has made public its
letter to the Secretary of the Treasury
of June 23 last asking, that the Comp
troller of the Treasury be requested to
review his recent decision in the matter
of the alleged illegal appointment of dep
uty United States marshals. In the course
of his decision, the Comptroller said: â¢
I will not km back of . the certificate of ap
pointment by the head of a department or
appointing power where no direct law has been
violate.l and attempt to ascertain whether
such officer in making such appointment has
disregarded some rule or regulation or the civil
service commission or rule or regulation of his
own regarding the classified service.
"prefer to let the responsibility rest where
it rlehtfullv belongs and follow the precedent
of years in my office to recognise the cer
tificate of appointment of the head of the de
partment or ottier appointing power to office
or place, where such appointment is not In vio
lation of law or without authority of law.
You are authorized to pay such deputy If his
account in all other respects Is correct.
The commissioners in their letter -contend
that the appointments under consideration
were made In violation of the express
terms of the law. and quote numerous au
thorities to show that the rules and regula
tion" have all the force and effect of law and
that exceptions to these rules and regulations
can be legally made only In the manner pro
vided by the law. â¢ ' : "^ 'Â'â "
The letter concludes as follows:
Thus from another point of view also we
must arrive at the same conclusion indicated
"the early part of this decision, namely (I)
that the Comptroller does not Intend to hold
that so long as a position in the classified
service is not exceptcd from the requirements
incident thereto, an appointment can be made
to such position without compliance with the
Provisions of the civil service laws and rules
rÂ«fiulrinK such appointment to be made through
examination and certification by the commis
sion and (2) consequently the only question left
at issue Is now, if at all. a position once in the
classified service can be legally executed or
withdrawn from the requirements of law In
cident to its classification.
And It has already been pointed out In the
first Dart of this communication ill that the
aw prescribed a certain definite manner In
which only the position can be thus with
drawn or excepted; (2) that In the case before
the Comptroller the position was not with
drawn or excepted In the manner prescribed,
and (3) consequently the conclusion cannot be
escaped that the appointment to the position
in a manner contrary to that prescribed was
illegal and void and hence the person appointed
was not entitled to any compensation or emolu
ment accruing to the office.

ter J. Shields, secretary of the State
Board of Agriculture, is kept busy tiling |
and answering applications from intend
ing exhibitors in the several departments j
of the annual exposition. The Sacramento
Chamber of Commerce has taken a hand
and has appointed a committee to co-op
erate with the agricultural directors in
providing attractive features for the fair.
Various "days'" are to be set apart and
their observance made popular events at
both the race course and the pavilion.
The agricultural directors have met the j
Chamber of Commerce committee in the
moat cordial spirit, and they will without j
doubt work in perfect harmony for the
success of the exposition this year. Here- :
tofore the local merchants have not taken ]
as much interest as they should in the i
pavilion display, but the belief Is general t
that there will be no further ground for i
criticism against the business men of this
city, who appear resolved to contribute
their full share toward improving the
pavilion features. . -
Had it not been for the loyal enthusiasm
of Mrs. E. M. Shield*, a well known or
chardlst, the county of Sacramento would
have gone unrepresented at the pavilion
display of farm and orchard products last
year. This year, however, the Patrons of
Husbandry, who are strong in this coun
ty, have shown a desire to manage the
county display. Many members of Po
: mona Grange No. 2 appeared before the
Board of Supervisors yesterday and ar
gued that its members should have the ;
control of the county exhibit. It was
shown that other granges In the county
had met and passed resolutions favorable
to the application. In recognition of the
past services of Mrs. Shields, however,
the Board of Supervisors stipulated that
she should be the chairman of the com
mittee of three which it would appoint,
the two others to be members of the
grange. Chairman Curtis then appointed
Mrs. Shields chairman of the county ex
| hibit committee and John A. Read and
i Thomas Walte, both of Pomona Grange,
as the remaining members.
It Is the intention to have a Grangers'
day at the fair, and no doubt it will prove
a noteworthy event.
The State Fair will open on September
4 and continue to the 18th, Inclusive. On
Saturday next entries to the twelve $1000
stakes and two $1500 purses offered by the
Agricultural Society will close. It Is be
lieved the list of entries will be larger
than that of any other association on the
i coast. The entries in the nomination
I purses close July 15, the horses to be
named by August 15. The two $1500 purses
are free-for-all stakes and will, it is be
lieved, bring some of the fastest flyers on
the coast to Sacramento.
ROBBERS' CACHE FOUND
ON STANFORD CAMPUS
Stolen Bicycles Hidden in the Tunnel
Leading Into Frenchman's
Lake.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, July !>.â A
Strange storage place for stolen bicycles
haa been discovered on a remote corner
of the campus. About ten days ago two
bieyM?s were stolen from the residence
of Rev. J. Wt Graybell in Palo Alto and
no tm~e of them could be discovered. This
week the two wheels were found by some
students secreted in the underground tun
nel leading into Frenchman's Lake, back
of the university. They evidently had
been hidden there, until they might be
safely disposed of.
The tunnel is a curious one, having been
built years ago by the old Frenchman,
Peter Couttfl, to whom much of the pres
ent campus once belonged. The use of
the tunnel has been the subject of spec
ulation, and whether it was for the pur
pope Ox developing water, or whether it
constituted an elaborate system of hiding
plnceÃ for defense is not known. A Stan
ford r.tudent two years ago took up the
matter for Independent research, but be
yond Keating one or two new caverns he
discovered nothing.
The present instance is the first known
where the tunnel has been used as a rob
bers' den.

City on the Shores of
Lake Erie.
TOLEDO. July 9.â Plans have been

bers of the colony.
Mr. Johnson states that $WOO has been
pledged to the enterprise, and that $10.
--000 more will be raised to mako the colony
perfectly independent from the start.

HARDSHIPS
OF WAR IN
WET SEASON
Soldiers in the Philippines
Practically Sourrounded
by Water.
BUNKS NOWJFLOODED
Manila Bay Impossible of Naviga
tion and No Vessels Are
Leaving the Harbor.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MANILA, July 10.â It has been
raining and storming almost
constantly for two days, and
the country along the Ameri
can south and bay lines is liter
ally flooded. The soldiers are suffering
great discomfort. The Thirteenth In
fantry Regiment at Pasay is in the
worst position, being practically sur
rounded by water.
The bridges that were used for get
ting supplies have been washed, away
and some of the companies are now
separated by streams six feet deep. In
many cases the men are sleeping with
three f^et of water beneath their bunks,
which are elevated on cracker boxes.
The company cooks, when preparing
the meals, stand knee deep in water.
Some of the roads leading to Pasay
are simply impassable and the rice
fields on all sides are one great lake.
A high wind blew over several tents of
the Second Reserve Hospital.
Manila Bay is impossible of naviga
tion by either launches or canoes and
no vessels are leaving the harbor.
The United States transport Centen
nial Is ready to sail for San Francisco
with discharged soldiers, but the latter
have to sit around the water front all
day drenched to the skin, waiting for
a launch to take them to the steamer.
The river Pasig and all the other
streams arp swollen and city streets at
all low points are covered with water.
FILIPINO LEADERS
READY TO DESERT.
MANILA, July 6 (via Hongkong July 9>.
Friendly Filipinos in Manila have been
the medium of communication between
the American authorities and the military
leaders of the insurrection in I'avite
}T. vince which for some time promised
to result in bringing over a prominent
general and several hundred of his fol
lowers with their arms. If the negotia
tions had succeeded the outcome would
have had a great moral effect, for other
detections doubtless would have followed.
Were the general's name given it might
had to action Similar to that which has
befallen other Filipinos suspected of
friendliness toward th.- Americans. He
hud foreseen the failure of the Insurrec
tion and advised Aguinaldo to make
terms, but it la understood that he has
sent word to the Americans that, having
sworn to support the insurrection, he
must remain loyal to the end.
Similar negotiations are said on good
authority to have been conducted with a
member" of the Cabinet of the "p-called
Filipino Government, who himself took
the initiative. Some form of money con
sideration figured in the discussion with
his friends.

BURIED TREE UNCOVERED.
Struck by Well Borers at a Depth of
Fifty-eight Feet.
STOCKTON. July 9- â Th(> country
around French ramp in this county has
long been noted for its geological for
mations The latest discovery which will
interest students was mad.- last week.
While boring an irrigation well at the
county hospital the auger passed through
a tree a 1 a depth of fifty-eight feet below
the surface. Many pieces were brought
to the surface. They were broken in
drawing them up, but Mr. Peck, the farm
overseer, secured and has on exhibition
one piece two Inches in diameter and
eight Inches lonÃ. The wood is rotten and
spongy, but a portion of the bark still
clings to it.
This is not the first time timber has
been struck at great depths in this vicin
itly Of the several wells which have
been bored on the county farm similar
discoveries have been made in nearly
every instance.
PALO ALTO TEACHERS.
Instructors Chosen to Preside Over
the Grammar School.
PALO AI/TO. July 9.â The School Trus
tees of Palo Alto have elected the follow
ing teachers for the grammar school for

vice-principal, Miss Ilattie Hudson; first
assistant, Miss R. A. Thompson; second
assistant, Miss H. K. Cuthbertson; third
assistant, Miss Mabel Charles; primary,
Mis^ Blanche Horing.
When the board organized last year ef
forts were made to overcome the dis
advantages that the school was then
contending with. The conservative pol
icy of the board baa borne fruit, for at
the close of the term its efforts were re
warded by the splendid showing made
and the complete satisfaction that pre
vailed.
It was expected the Hifjh School corps
of instructors would ho elected the past
week, but action was postponed pend
ing the rearrangement of some of the
courses in the school and the obtaining
of further information in regard to the
applicants for the various positions.

THE MOTOR
CYCLE AS A
PACEMAKER
Linton and Miller Import
Three Naphtha Tandems
From France.
NEW ERfIN RACING
Miller Will Branch Out as a Middle
and Long Distance RiderâAu
tomobiles in Philadelphia.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, July 9.â Motor-paced
cycle racing will receive consid
erable of an impetus in Amer
ica by the return from Europe
of "Tom" Linton and Charles
W. Miller. They bring with them three
French-made naphtha tandems and tell
glowing tales of the success of this
style of machine in paced races in Eu
rope.
Two of the machines brought over
are the property of Linton, whose in
tention it is to meet all comers in mid
distance competition during his Ameri
can sojourn. To assist Linton there
came with him one of the best tandem
pacing crews in the business. They
are August Cabaillat of Paris. France, j
who is claimed to be without a peer,
and Dudley Marks. Before the season |
closes this "pair will challenge American i
pacing crews to a series of races on I
motor tandems.
Charles Miller's purpose in importing |
the French tandem is to begin training
for middle and lung distance races. Six
day contests are too few and far be
tween, says Miller, and and so he in- j
tends to enter the class of which Harry j
Elkes and Linton are the most promi- |
nent exponents.
Miller's debut in this style of racing :
will be made in a match with Elkes at |
a distance of 100 miles. After the lat- j
ter's injured arm permits this race will
take place at Manhattan Beach within
a fortnight.
It is Miller's intention to meet Burns
Pierce and Frank Waller in similar
races later in the season.
Both Linti-n and Miller believe that
races of one hour's duration, open to
all, would become as popular in New
York. Philadelphia and other Ameri
can cities as they are in France. In
races of this kind in Paris, says Linton.
as many as ten or thirteen competitors
have started, each paced by a m< >t<>r
cycle. Linton won the Grand Prix de
Paris at fifty kilometers, with the lat
ter number of competitors. The ma
chines the Welshman brings with him
carried him to victory in seven out of
the nine races in which he has started
this year. Among the noted European
rider's he defeated in these contests
were Walbers. Taylor. Bouhours,
Champion. CISCOC and Chase.
Linton. while eager for a match with
Elkes, will first pay his respects to Ed
die McDuffie. The Boston race follower,
he says, issued several challenges to
him immediately after he had departed
from America last year and at a time
when he could not accept them. He
offers to meet McDuffie at any distance
the latter names above ten miles, but
suggests that a series of three races be
arranged, McDuffie to choose the dis
tance of the first. Linton that of the
second and if a third be necessary its
length to be decided by toss.
PHILADELPHIA, July 9.â Jules
Junker, who is perhaps the most
enthusiastic automobilist in Philadel
phia, said to-night that before the sum
mer is past Philadelphia is likely to
have one of the most imposing clubs
in the country. The chief difficulty, he
said, is the present scarcity of self-pro
pelling machines, but this will be soon
obviated. He has three automobiles
now and has another machine built in
France on its way to this country. Its
cost in Paris was J7OO. and the duty to
be paid will be 45 per cent, thus making
a total of $1200.

Anniversary of the Birth of
Mr. Claus Spreckels.
APTOS. July P.â Claus SpreekHs. who Is
spending his summer vacation at his coun
try residence her*-, celebrated his 71st
birthday to-day. There was quite an as
semblage of members of his family and
intimate friends, who had gathered to ex
tend good wishes for the future and con
gratulations upon the successful rounding
of another milestone in life's pathway.
Mr. Spreckels' unimpaired vigor and ac
tivity wore the cause of much comment
among those who visited Aptos in honor 1
of the occasion, and it was a frequent re
mark that 1h- bore the weight of his three
score and eleven years more easily than
most of the business men of the present
day bear the half-century period in their
lives.
The day was spent quietly at the pleas
ant summer home of the philanthropist,
the guests enjoying to the full the boun
teous hospitality for which the host ! s

I What a Little Faith Did
FOR MRS. ROCKWELL. ,
[LETTER TO MRS. PINKHAM HO. 69,884]
"I was a great sufferer from female
weakness and had no strength. It was
impossible for me to attend to my
household duties. I had tried every-
thing and many doctors, but found no
relief.
My sister advised me to try Lydia
E. Pinkhams Vegetable Compound,
which I. did; before using all of one
bottle I felt better. I kept on with it
and to my great surprise I am cured.
All who suffer from female complaints
should give it a trial." Mrs. Rock-
] well, 1209 8. Division St., Gka>*d

From a Grateful Newark Woman. â 
" When I wrote to you I was very
sick, had not been well for two years.
'The doctors did not seem to help me,
and one said I could not live three
1 months. I had womb trouble, falling,
ulcers, kidney and bladder trouble.
There seemed to be such a drawing
j and burning pain in my bowels that I
could not rest anywhere. After using
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound and Sanative Wash and follow-
ing your advice, I feel well again and
stronger than ever. My bowels feel as if
they had been made over new. With
many thanks for your help, I remain,

TRADE CURRENTS APPARENTLY
SHIFTING.
TRADE still continues above the average all over
country. All the leading staples are reported
active and some are abnormally so for the
midsummer season. As the half yearly returns from :
the different lines come in it is more and more ap
parent that the business of the United States for the
rim six n the year was phenomenal. There
are indicati 'me decrease in the iron trade, a<
many of the numerous orders mentioned so freely of
late have turned out to be the same orders sent in to
mill after mill in a vain attempt to be filled. Thus

abnormally high level without difficutly, and ship

ISO MERCENARIES.
IN Moscow is the great hospital Dom, to which the
foundlings of the whole empire are sent to be

tution boys are reared, knowing no parents, no fam
ily, nothing but the state, to be put into the army as

support of autocracy. The child of the state has no

If the outgivings from Washington are correct. ::s
: methods in this country are* the same as in every land
I where they have been applied.
If this is a republic the people who furnish the
blood and the money required for its maintenance
have a right to the fullest knowledge of all matters,
in war and peace, prosecuted in their name. Early
j in our undeclared war in the Philippines it was said
by soldiers who knew the theater upon which that
war must be fought, and by civilians who knew the
people who must be subjugated by it. that 100.000 to
150,01 rs would be required there. The com

â  time up to the last of Tune, when he said
be over except for the anti-imperialist senti
ment in the United States, and that he must have
more men. The administration is raising the men.
Its method is by recruiting at the regular army re
cruiting stations. A call on the States for volunteers
to be rilled by the National Guard organizations
would be promptly answered and any quota demanded
would be met. It is given out from the office of the
adjutant general that there are various reasons for
refusing the call for volunteers. It is said that regulars
are preferable: State organizations enlist too much
popular interest; in every volunteer regiment there
is sure to be a new-paper man: the operations of vol
unteers, death and disease among them are fully
reported.
the other hand no personal interest is felt in the
regulars. The case of the immunes is cited. Ten
regiments of the-e blacks were recruited as regulars
during the Spanish war, any number of them might
have been kill< ' â¢-â â  tn led or diseased, and no one
would have cared; but whenever anything went wrong
with the volunteers Congressmen, Governors and
even State Legislatures came to the front to demand
of the President and Secretary of War the righting of
whatever was wrong. To rid itself of this popular
interest the War Department prefers a class of sol
diers who do not excite it. In other words, an army
as nearly mercenary a-; car, be found is required to
carry out an imperial policy. With such an army in
â¢ â  Spanish war there would have been no complaint

food at the highest price for the best. The regulars
could have died of eating it and the taxpayers could
have footed the bill and everything would have gone
othly as the most advanced student of addition,
division and silence could desire.
Another reason given for this method of providing
troop? is that it will not be necessary for the people
to know how many are enlisted. As it happens that
the people are paying eight hundred thousand dollars
a day for this Philippine war. it may be found expe
dient to treat them with more frankness. It may be
.- axiomatic that any act of the Executive

THE EDUCATIONAL CONVENTION.
LI IS ANGELES will this week have the "honor of
entertaining what will perhaps prove to be the
most important convention of the year. Even
if the work which it accomplishes, be small in imme
diate result?, the assembly will none the less be a
notable one, for the mere meeting of so large a num
ber of men and women engaged in so potent an oc
cupation as that of instructing the youth of the nation
and shaping the education of the children of. 70,000,
--000 of people cannot be regarded as other than an
event of great moment.
In his work on conditions in this country M. de
Tocqueville said: "It cannot be doubted that in the
United States the instruction of the people power
fully contributes to the support of a democratic re
public; and such must always be the case, I believe,
where instruction which awakens the understanding
iÂ« not separated from moral education which amends
the heart."
That sentiment, written early in the century, is
shared by the closest observers of our institution? to
day. The welfare of our political institutions depends
largely upon our schools and upon the instruction
which i<= given in them. Every educational conven
tion is therefore a matter of public concern, and the
proceedings are watched with a more general and a
more intelligent interest than is accorded to the meet
ings of the representatives of any other single indus
try among us.
When the educators have completed their work in
Los Angeles they should then be provided with a
means of seeing Central and Northern California be
fore they go home. The managers in charge of the
convention of agriculturists in this city very wisely
arranged for the delegates an extensive programme
of travel throughout the State, so that they will be
able to return East with an intelligent idea of what
California is. Something similar should be arranged
for the visiting teachers. The number of delegates
to the educational convention is too large for any
considerable excursions to be provided for al! of them .
in a body, but separate tours might be arranged
that would be thoroughly satisfactory.
ThJEODORE ROOSEVELT.
ST. PAUL made it his aim to he all tilings to all
men, but Theodore Roosevelt is making him
self one tiling to all men and is finding it profit
able. He made a speech to the students of Cornell '
University and lauded culture as the best thing on I
earth, saying amid the cheers of students and faculty
alike: "Our country could better afford to lose all i
the men who have amassed millions than to lose one- â 
half of its college-bred men." Then straightway he
went to New Mexico to meet the Rough Riders, and
in a speech to them said: "I pride myself upon the;
fact that I am an Eastern man by birth, but I want
to say to you that I am prouder of the fact that I am
a Western mar. by cultivation."
Clearly Mr. Roosevelt is a congenial companion to
whatever company he iÂ« in. Before a university au
dience he would rather be a college mp.n than two
millionaire?, and before a mustang audience he would
rather be a cowboy than an LL.D. If there seem to]
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JULY 10, 1599.
be a contradiction or even a variation in such state
! ments it is a case of seeming that is deceptive. The
genial orator is not a man who has made millions.
i but he is one who has graduated from Harvard and
I has lived in the West, so his philosophy is consistent
with his record.
What he has accomplished in the way of remaining
himself and yet making that self equally pleasing to
the classic assembly in the academic halls of Cornell
and the free and easy crowd that greeted him in New
Mexico is slight in comparison to what he did when
in his campaign for the Governorship he managed to
satisfy the exacting "Goo Goos" of New York poli
tics without in any way ceasing to satisfy the machine
and its boss, Senator Platt. An accomplishment of j
that kind required no little tact and proved that the j
famous Rough Rider is a strategist as well as a
fighter.
There are people who regard Roosevelt's activity
in swinging around the circle from Massachusetts to (
New Mexico as an evidence of a desire to work up a I
boom for himself as a candidate for the Presidency :
next year. All reports of any such intention on his
part are promptly denied by him, but he recognizes
that denials do not count for much in politics. There
is no instance on record of any man ever admitting (
that he desired to be a candidate for the Presidency, j
Roosevelt knows that and therefore he adds to his |
denial something in the way of confirmation. He goes
to Washington, becomes the guest of the President
and from the White House itself reiterates his confi- j
dence that his host will be renominated.
So the versatile Roosevelt manages in every june- j
ture to do the proper thing in the proper way. He [
has all the elements that are required to make up j
popularity, and as Governor of New York he may
show himself possessed of the qualities demanded of a 1
statesman fitted for the Presidency. His one danger i
i? that of talking too much and of being too eager to
say pleasant things. A foolish speed; has blighted j
many a career that was once as promising as his to
day.
THE PLEDGE OND THE PEOPLE.
WERE it not for the serious issues that are in
volved the controversy now going on over
the dollar limit tax levy would constitute one
of the most grotesque farces known to American poli
tics. It contains nearly every possible element of
humor, and reveals the fickleness, the contradictions
and the absurdities of human nature in a striking light
and in singularly ridiculous situations.
For years the talking and vociferous element of the
taxpayers of San Francisco has been clamorously in
sistent in demanding the administration of the city
upon a tax levy not exceeding $i on every Sioo of the
assessed valuation of property. So frequently was the
demand iterated and reiterated that "dollar limit"
became one of the most familiar phrases of the com
munity. Reformers shouted it and audiences ap
plauded it. No municipal campaign was complete !
without it. If the conventions of the two great parties
neglected to include it in the platform there was ,
-â¢â¢ ghtway organized an independent movement to ;
push it to the front, and numerous and loud was the
band that helped in the pushing.
One administration after another failed to comply]
with the dollar-limit demand. Republicans in office
refused the popular wish and at the next election they
were retired to private life. Democrats in office
scorned the dollar limit, and they in turn were rele
gated to obscurity. At each successive act fixing a'
tax rate higher than that of one dollar on th? hundred,
voices of strong condemnation were heard in the land. {
They came from the people, from the press and even j
from the pulpit. Supervisors were denounced as be
trayers of trust, breakers of pledges, plunderers of the
public, boodlers and robbersâ and all because they did
not keep their promise and be true to the dollar limit.
At the last municipal election the old cry was taken
up by Mayor Phelan and sounded by him and his sup
porters with unusual clearness and force. Over and
over again Phelan shouted that slogan until it became
something like the universal cry of San Francisco. 1
When the conventions met each party pledged its ;
candidates to the dollar limit. The pledge was made
as explicit as language can be, and a- binding as any
form of promise that can be made. Because he stood,
as the conspicuous champion of the dollar limit, Phe
lan was elected Mayor, although nearly every other:
man on his ticket was defeated. Not a single man of
either party was elected who was not pledged to thnt
rate of taxation. If there be any such thing as an 'â 
expression of the will of the people that expression
was given last fall in favor of a rate of taxation not
exceeding $i on an assessed valuation of $350,000,000. |
\\> have now at last a majority of the Board off
Supervisors who purpose to keep the pledge. They
have announced an intention to be true to the require
ments of their party platforms, to make their per
formance in office correspond to their promises of the
campaign. The Finance Committee has reported in
favor of such a levy and the majority of the board;
stands ready to accept it.
Now for the Board of Supervisors there ought to
be applause and praise. Bands ought to play and â¢
bonfires burn. The citizens have achieved a great !
victory. They have at last in office faithful public
servants. The dollar limit of taxation is assured for ', j
the ensuing year. The reformers, the taxpayers, the
economical administration advocates, the various as- :
sociations for civic improvement, have all a share in
the triumph, and ought to be loud in rejoicing.
Strange as it may seem, there is no rejoicing. There '
is no applause. Many of those who were most insist- j
ent upon the dollar limit are now denouncing the ,
Supervisors for a willingness to grant the demand. ;
Every department of the municipal government is
clamoring for a larger allowance of money, and in !
every case the clamor is supported by a considerable
body of taxpayers and prominent citizens. The Su
pervisors, instead of receiving applause for keeping
faith with the people, are being subjected to a tremen
dous pressure to force them to be false.
Nothing that aristocratic philosophers and wits ever
said of the fickleness of public opinion is any too
mocking to describe what is now going on over this
issue. The very men who demanded the dollar limit
and supported Phelan in shouting for it are now urg
ing the Supervisors to impose a higher rate. The
very men who are now denouncing the Supervisors
for upholding their pledge would have denounced
them just as loudly if they had of their own will
broken that pledge.
There is but one thing for the Supervisors to Jo,
and that is to hold fast to the pledge by which they
won the suffrages of the people. The best way to rid
municipal campaigns of ill-considered policies is to
enforce them. It is time the doll?--Hmit policy
should be tested. The people by a unanimous declar
ation through the platforms of all parties have de
manded it. and because some men have shown them
selves fickle, there is no reason to believe the whole
people are so. If the Supervisors keep faith with the
people they cannot be blamed if the estimates of the
Mayor turn out to be erroneous and deceptive.
The Fourth of July Committee has whitewashed
Colonel T. P. Robinson. The majority of the mem
bers evidently thought he was a "fence."

They thus expect to retatn the business

NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
In the French navy orders will shortly
be issued to build four torpedo-cruisers
of the Faucon type, three of which were
built in 1885-87. They are: The Condor, of
1243 tons; Eperoier, 12SS tons, and Faucon,
1239 tons, and are all of the same general
dimensions. namely. 216.5 feet length. 2?.
feet beam and 15.42 feet draught. Their
speed ranges from 17.7 to 17.1 knots, with
horsepower from 3800 to 3200. These new
boats and four submarine boats are to be
built at Rochefort.
The British cruiser Hermione, on the
China station, collided with a Chinese
fishing junk on March 7 on the coast of
Kwantung. sinking: the junk and drown
ing the wife and three children of the
skipper. The Chinaman sued for damages
and the case was tried in the Hongkong
Supreme Court. The acting chief justice,
W. M. Goodman, rendered his decision on
May 15, rinding that the Hermione was
entirely at fault and awarded $150 dam
ages to the unfortunate Chinese fisher
man for the loss of wife and three chil
dren. As the woman was 2? years of age.
the supposed value of her services up to
say 60 years were thus rated at $3.91 per
annum.' The claim of damages for loss
of vessel has not yet been settled.
An interesting comparison of the Brit
ish, French and Russian navies in regard
to battleships and cruisers appeared in a
recent number of the Nineteenth Century.
All the ships are reduced to a common
standard, five points being awarded to
modern large battleships, three to middle
aged and small modern battleships, two
to completelj" rearmed and reconstructed
battleships and to modern armored cruis
ers. To large protected cruisers like the
Powerful are. assigned I 1? and the ordi
nary protected cruiser one. > On this basis
the summary is as follows:
I Battle-
COUNTRIES. i ships. Cruisers Total.
England 11l 154 355
France ; 120 75.5 155.5
Russia ... 115 31 14.;
'â â¢â¢TN-TRIES.
From those figures the English fleet is
about double that of France in strength
ami somewhat superior to the combined
fleets of France and Russie.
The British cruiser Pyramus of 2135 tons '
-one of eight vessels of that class just
completedâ made her four hours full pow- '
er trial trip on May 31. developing 23.7
knots under 7303 horse power, with 2iU3 '
revolutions and a steam pressure in the i
boilers of -â¢ 1 pounds. The tendency of all i
the naval powers to keep up the speed of j
vessels of all kinds and. in fact, to im- ,
prove upon previously built ships, attracts
attention to the six cruisers of. the Den- i
ver class which have been designed for'
the United Stales navy. In these design? i
there has been an apparent -retrogression I
in speed, for the Cincinnati and Raleigh,
of 3200 tons, were rated at 19 knots, where
as the Denver class, on 3100 tons trial dis
placement, are to make only I6M knot*.
To offset this loss of speed the. normal
coal carried Is 470 tons in the new ships. â 
! against 350 tons in the Cincinnati. Ye s -
; of a somewhat similar type in the British
navy are the Spartan class, of which
are ten, all built in 1890, and long
the shirs had the advantage now
; ,- tnfl use of water-tube boilers.
The comparative data of the Si n
and EX nver class are r.-v

ountries:

An Interesting target practice at sea
took place recently in the Mediterranean.
j A floating target four feet in length and
two feet six inches wide, made in oval
I shape and showing less than one foot
: above water, was towed by the British
i battleship Camperdown at the rate of
j eight knots an hour. This target was fired
I at by the six-inch guns of the battleship
i Royal Oak at a distance of 1200 yards
j and running in an opposite direction at
! a speed of eight knots. The first broad
| side demolished the target, and the Navy
! and Army Illustrated concludes from this
! incident that "the navy still keeps up the
j high standard of shooting which has
i characterized it since the days of the
i Virgin Queen,'" but the conclusion of

CHAMBERS, KAUTZ & CO.
The latest Intelligence received from
Apia makes it vi 'hat the â¢â settle
ment" of the Samoan question is Dot com
' pleted. The business will not be finished
until Chief JuÃtice Chambers is recailed
and reprimanded for malfeasance in office,
to designate his official conduct in tho
it manner possible. Nor can It be
..red at an end before Admiral
â¢ is disciplined for the shameful part
which he played in the wretched drama
ted prior to the advent of the com
mission sent by the three Governments to
31 matters.
There is every reason to believe that tne
unofficial statement of the decisions of
the commission will be materially chang'a
in the official report of their work.
Enough is known of the actual situation
with which the members of the board had
to deal to justify the belief that nothing
short of chambers" dismissal and the for
mal investigation of the acis of our naval
representative win satisfy the sense of
decency of those who in the last analysis
ar- officially responsible for these men.
In advance of the attempts of interested
. . respondents to clear the skirts of
Chambers and Kautz. the methods of
both were honestly portrayed and scath
ingly reprol â  their
acts" not deterred t v s- ntimental n0t!...:?

Ing the truth, our own correspondent on
the ground, who is in a position to speak
with authority, dec]: fes ago
! that the America!: i fft lals in question
being led around I the noÂ» by
British disturbers of the p~ace. This fact
has since been positively verified by other
manly American observers â " events In
Samoa. The coi nt of Th<
by the last steamer from Apia a
.v account of the labors of the com
missi oners and a forecast of the probable
i recommendations that will be included in
: the majority rt port of that body. It ap
pears that the English commissioners at
; tempt to dominate matters as h;i-.
; done by the British Consul and naval
;-:ith"ri"ties previous to his arrival, ran
against a snag in the opposition of his
American and German colleagues. Com
missioner Eliot was in favor of sustain
ing Chambers. Kautz and Sturdee in face
of the most damaging - - Â«ra:n:-t
them but the other commissioners, ac
cording to The Call's informant, would
not listen to a proposal that violated
every reouirement of justice and truth.
It is oorfidently predicted that both Cham.
hers and Kautz will be properly grilled n
fflcial findings of the commission.
The American Consul. Luther W. Osborn.
directed his efforts toward a peaceful so
lution of the difficulties precipitated by
the infamous conduct of the Chief Jus
tice and his British allies, but the London
missionary influence, which it seems was
praamount with the Anglo-American com
bine thwarted all attempts to reach a set
tlement based upon equitable treatment
of Mataafa and the majority of the island
ers, whom they saw fit to antagonize.
The whole controversy was provoked by
the bigotry and insolence of alien func
tionaries, who sought to run things to
suit themselves on the assumption that
the natives had no rights which powerful
usurpers were bound to respect, or even
recognize.â The Monitor.
STURDEE'S EXPLANATION.
"We had to have some fun to keep alivÂ«
in this beastly. God-forsaken country." is
the explanation which the gallant Captain
Sturdee of H. M. S. Porpoise vouchsafes
for the shelling of villages of Samoa in
habited by inoffensive old men, women
and" children. Kautz's exploits In the
same line were Inspired evidently by tha
example of the British captain and as a
guarantee of good faith in the formation
of an Anglo-American alliance for the ex
termination of the natives.â Monitor.

SERMONS ON MANY THEMES.
SOLEMN SERVICES
AT ST. PATRICK'S
The forty hours of devotion was in
augurated in St. Patrick's Church yester
day morning at the 11 o'clock mass with
solemn services. Solemn high mass was
celebrated by Father Cummings. He was
assisted by Father Barry as deacon; sub
deacon, Father Horan; master of ceremo
nies, Father Heslin. At the conclusion of
the mass the procession of the blehsea
secrament followed. Preceding the par
ticipants in the mass were the acolytes,
and behind them little girls dressed in
white. who strewed flowers In the aisles.
In the evening Father Heslin delivered
an Interesting sermon on the origin of the
forty hours of devotion and its meaning.
In part the holy father said:
The services of the forty hours of devo
tion are held in honor of the forty hours our
divine lord's body lay In the tomb. It was
introduced in this country about the year
].-; It lias been practiced in European
count for upward of 360: years. It first
had its origin In the city of Milan = in . I''7l1 ''7 l
In that year a terrible plague attacked the
city and the people were cast into terrible
fear bi-cause of the ravages the dread dis
ease was making among them and ti.e
recollection of a similar plague which de
vastated the city twelve years tore, carry
ing off nearly 120,000 inhabitants. At this
time thÂ« <-lty was torn by internal feuds
and also threatened by an invading army in
command of the King of Naples, which had
surrounded Milan and threatened to cap
ture the city by laying siege.
In the cathedral in Milan there was a
pious priest, a Capucian, named J^^' l! ' Â°*
Fero who. seeine in the state of affairs the
lwnd' of God raised against the People,^
believing thai the vengeance which .the r
sins bad called forth could* be parted by
repenting of their sins a nd by Imploring
pardon nd mercy, like Jonas wit h the
ikinevites. he urged the people to do pen
ance in sack cloth and ashes.
\< a remedy for the evil and as a pro
tection from the threatened vengeance of
heaven, he suggested a devotion of tortv
hours in honor of the forty hours! our di
vine Savior lay In the tomb, while at the
sÂ«me time they could adore the living
Savior in the adoration of the EuchriÃ^pub;
j C lj. posed for that purpose. The inhab
itants for man. s.-eing a release from mis
ery in the wise suggestions of the holy
priest, put his proposal? Into pract fe.Â£* n
front of the cathedral at MÂ«lnp ""'''" ;â¢
sacrament was exposed for adoration ob ft
rlevated place, surrounded by a Kit al .i.ii
ber of lightsj All the inhabitant, of Milan,
the city" officials and the Cardinal Arch
blahOD took part in this devotion, being clad
nil sack cloth'aa a sip of their repentance.
When this devotion at the * cathedral was
con.-Mded it was celebrated in nil tni
churches of the city with as great zeal and
Pie" The effects of this devotion was soon
v sib y felt. Like the Slnevltes, the Ml
lanese by their sincere repentance obtained
pardon for their crimes, their prayers for
mer.-v and forgiveness were heard, the
plague ceased, internal dUsentlona were
changed into harmony and the hostile fee
ings of the opposing kings turned Into feel-
Ings of friendship, war was averted and
peace established.

THE HA:** FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JULY 10, 1899.
interesting sermon to the conprogation of
the Calvary Presbyterian Church yester
day morning. His subject was. "A * ure
tor the Blues." He said in part:
The first half of the text is blue, the last
half bright, but I shall do my best to bring
a bright sermon out of the whole of it.
What a gloriously hoppful book the Bible
is. Hope runs though it like the river of
God whirh I* full of water. The man who
uttered i.ur text was unsatisfied and deeply
discouraged. Hut our text does not teach a
lesson of discouragement, but one 01 nope
fulness. "Ho;>e thou in God. for 1 shall
yet ), raise him." Let us lay the emphasis
on the rijrht word, "yet." We get dis
couraged too easily. I.ast March we were
all cryinjc <>ut, "It is all up with rali
foraia." A few evenings ago a millionaire
farn-.er tnld me he had never seen sU'h
crops In California since '49. The tide is
coming in now for California without a
doubt, but it is coniins in slowly as it
always does and as it should. We must get
hold of the Bible truth that the <;-.d of the
Bible is especially the Ood of the dis
appolnted.
HOW MUCH IS MAN
BETTER THAN SHEEP?
Rev. J. George Gibson of the Emman
uel Baptist Church addressed a large
congregation last evening. He took his
text from Matthews, xii:l2: "How much,
then. is. a man better than a sheep?" He
said in part: â¢
Christ had no Intention to depreciate the
sheep He was too much of a Jew to do
that among Jews. lie knew the value of
the sheep commercially, and he knew its
importance religiously. The sheep was of
much value, but man was of more value,
and man's greater value can only be ap
preciated when we know the good parts ot
a sheep. In the Bible the natural world
and the human are brought together in the
sheep and the man. Almost the first story
speaks of the firstlings of .the nock and the
last on revelation of the lamb before the
throne.
Tbe sheep Is always rendering some ser
vice. It is always living for others. There
never seems to be a moment that it can call
Its own. If it eat, It is li-it after a while
it ay be slain. If it grows old, it Is that
it may give of its wool to keep others warm.
It is at the command of other?, it is at
the service of others. If it receives, it is In
order that it may give. To Itself the sheep
Is nothing. It is in the world for the world s
" Who lives the life of sacrifice willingly?
He is better than a sheep Who work and
lives and grows for ethers because he pre
fers to do so? He is better than a sheep.
But are there many such lives In the world.
yes there are many. There are fathers,
mothers and friends leading humble but
noble lives. Because they are not great
some have despised them. Their glory Is
that they are content to be despised. Pray
God we may have more such men and wo
men. Useful people are more needed than
great people or rich people, for sometimes
the rich are not so good as sheep, for they
live such selfish lives, and the world re
members them not by what they Rave away,
but what they were compelled to leave.
A SERMON ON HOVELS.
Rev. William Racier Discourses on
Their Vast Influence.
The Rev. William Rader delivered his
regular Sunday evening sermon last night
at the Third Congregational Church, tak- j
ing as his, text: "Therefore all thin?.' J
whatsoever ye would that, men should do i
unto you, do ye even so to them, tor this ;
is the": iv.- and the prophets."
The pastor's address was full of inter
est. He spoke of the novel and of Its vast j
Influence. He differentiated the various
classes of novels and discussed, as exem
plifying his text, the late book of uMward
Noves W'estcott, "David Harum. ' He
said:
There Is more religion than we ordinarily
suppose in the commonplace of life. All
saints are not robed and gowned. All the
heroism of the world Is not blown through
a trumpet or thundered In the guns. There
is not a word about orthodoxy or theology
in "David Harum," but his life Is crowned
with the Golden Â»Rule.
Dwelt on "Life."

on "Life" from the text '-Thou wilt shew j
me the path of life; in thy presence is
fullness of |oy; at thy right hand there :
are pleasures for evermore," Psafrns,
xvi:2. The sermons in the Christian
Science churches is not preached by a
pastor in th- usual way. but consists of
selections from the Bible and correlative
passages from Science and Health with
a key to the Scriptures by Rev. Mary
Baker G. Eddy, read alternately by two j
readi rs. '
MRS. EDMONDS
SUFFERS DEATH
FROM FRIGHT
She Thought Burglars
Were in the House.
A DOG SET OFF FALSE ALARM.
SHE DIED JUST AS ASSISTANCE
REACHED HER.
_ â Â« "
Deceased Was a Well Known and Suc
cessful Physician and Widow of
an Ex-Judge of the Su
perior Court.
__ _^.
Death called Dr. Mary C. Edmonds, a
well-known physician of this city, in trag
ic fashion at her home, 913 Bush street,
last evening. The accidental setting off of
a burglar alarm wrought up her nerves to
- such a strain that she suffered death by
fright. Being alone in her home at. the
time, the supposition is that a dog which
she kept for protection started up the
staircase, which contained the little elec
trical- appliance, connected the circuits
and sounded the false alarm, which
brought fatal results. The police were
prompt in responding, but could find no
traces of any intruder on the premises.
About 7 o'clock Mrs. Edmonds was seen
entering her house by Mrs. Mary Comp
ton, who resides at 911 Bush street Mrs.
Edmonds lived alone, and had evidently
just returned from her office at 330 Sutter
street. At 9:30 Mrs. Compton was startled
by the sound of a police whistle in the
neighborhood. She called to her son to
Step to the door and ascertain what the
cause of the trouble was. In the mean
time she went to the front upper window
of her house, and looking out saw Mrs.
Edmonds at a second story window lean
ing out and blowing a whistle.
Mrs. Compton called to the woman and
received the reply that there were bur
glars in the house. Realizing that some
thing should be done immediately, she
called to the unfortunate woman to keep
cool and then summoned help. T. Mac-row \
of 2712 Army street, who happened to be:
passing, and W. H. Kelley, a neighbor
two doors distant, quickly responded and
rushed up the steps to the door. They
found it locked and they were unable to
enter. Mrs. Compton called to Mrs. Ed
monds to come down and open the door,
and that there were friends near who
would render her assistance.
The doctress disappeared from the win
dow and the men waited at the door.
Soon It was opened and both gentlemen
sprang Inside, only to see the hapless
woman totter as if to fall. They caught
her in their arms, but her body became
limp and helpless, and they laid her on
the floor, where she soon expired.
The .sound of the alarm brought a num
ber of officers hurriedly to the scene.
From the Central Police Station came Of
ficer J. W. Davids and Officer William
Rice Both made an examination of the
premises and soon became satisfied that
the alarm had been a false one. There
was but one window open in the house,
I but an examination of the sill showed
| that the dust on it had not been disturbed
WHAT CONSTITUTES
AN IDEAL MAYOR
Roy. J. H. Beard chose for the topic of
last night's discourse the "Ideal Mayor."
Grace Methodist Episcopal Church held a
large congregation, which gave close at
tention to the preacher. He selected
Nehemiah as his model Mayor and de
scribed in glowing terms the pious ;>;>tr:
otism of that time. Dr. Beard spoke in
part as follows:
Most people have been impressed with the
importance and influential position which
cities occupy in our modern life. We have
a parallel in ancient times, in Jerusalem,
and its relation to the Holy Land. In mod
ern times the lines of commerce center In
our citiesâ they are the points of intelli
gence, and so they have come to exert a
vast Influence. The responsibilities of citi
zenship in one of these centers increases ac
cordingly.
Styling Nehemiah, the Mayor of Jerusa
lem, 1 tHke him as my model. He pos
â essed tl â  fundamental requisite of a good
character One of the trreat pmhiems of
modern times is to pet Into positions of im
portance men of character. The failure to
do this is th>- one preat defect of our mu
nicipalities. Seldom do we allow the office
to seek the man. This was strikingly il
lustrated In the array of candidates for
the Senatorship before the last Legislature.
We have had pood men In office in San
Francisco, but their efforts have been con
fined to the narrow limits of their positions.
Courage and competence are other necessary
qualities In a good Mayor.
THE BICYCLE AS
A MORAL AGENT
Rev. W. E. Dugan of the Stewart Me
morial United Presbyterian Church used
the modern bicycle as the subject of his
sermon last evening and for the purpose
of pointing a moral. In part he said:
The wheel spoken of is God's wheel of
Providence, in creation and redemption.
A circle as represented by the wheel Is
the most beautiful figure and most graceful
curve, representing the beauf- of provi
dence. A curve Is also the figure of com
petition, system and harmony ?uch as we
have In the inward workings of the provi
dence of God. The wheel here stands as
a symbol of the chariot of victory upon
which Christ is riding to the millennium
glory.
But let us look at these words in refer-"
ence to the modern wheel, the bicycle. The
bicycle Is a moral agent In that It affords
healthful exercise. It la objected that it
takes people from church, but If people only
come to church because they cannot get
away, they had better stay at home. The
bicycle la a vivid illustration of the power
of a good habit. At first you plunge and
fall You are told to turn the front wheel
in the direction you are falling. You think
and stagger and sometimes go down, hut
by keeping at It after a while you instinct
ively turn the wheel the way you are going
to fall: you instinctively balance and swing
your body. What at first you had to do by
remembering the rule becomes a second
nature to you, so that you do It without
thinking. So with a good habit. At first
you must remember and try and struggle,
but after a while, if you keep on, it be
comes natural to go to church and pray
and do things that at first required a firm
resolution. _.
The wheel calls for individual effort. There
Is no leaning upon the shoulder of another.
In riding a wheel you never stand still. To
ride very slowly is one of the tricks. You
must keep going or fall. So in morals. V
TRADES UNIONS
AND CHRISTIANITY
A larpe congregation filler] Epworth
Methodist Episcopal Church, at Twenty
sixth and Church streets, hist nisht to
hear Rev. W. M. Woodward on the sub
ject of "Trades Unions and Christianity."
The pastor spoke earnestly and convinc
ingly defending in vigorua language the
riph't of thÂ»- workingmen to combine. Ins
sermon was. briefly, as follows:
The word ol God pleads the cause of. no
BDecinl Class, although all classes quote It
in support of their particular theories. The
employer often reads approvingly, â¢Servaati
Obey your masters in al! things, for this
Is right " but fails to see that other pas
sage "Masters, give onto your Bervanta
that which is ju.Â«t and equal." There is
strife between capital and labor bnmght
on by each not recognizing the rights of the
other T'-ere can be no settlement of the
struggle except by the mediation of the
Nazarene carpenter's s >n. The object of
workingmen combining In union is, first.
protection The formation of great trusts
has made trades unions a necessity. It is
. .. for one man alone to ask r.r rictus
from a great corporation, but when a g
army of men make a demand they are
likely to be heard.
and that no intruder had passed in and
nut that way.
Mrs. Edmonds was a very talented and
successful physician 'if this city. She I
was the widow of Judge Edmonds, late of
the Superior <'"iirt. and leaves two s-ons
and a daughter. The latter, Miss Annie
Edmonds, is .i teacher In Berkeley, and
nni' of her sums, Frank W. Edmond?,
who has been connected with the Unii id
States Geodetic Survej for years. Is now
in Alaska. Her other son, Dr. Harry Ki
monds, is a physician, practicing in
Fresno County.
The story of Mrs. Edmonds' adopt! m of
medicine as a profession is a sad and pc- !
culiar one. Her husband, during his lifi -
time. Buffered from a disease which
neither the surgeon's knife nor the physi
cian's prescription could alleviate. The
faithful woman delved Into the science in
the hope that she might administer
proper treatment and ease his Bufferings.
After his death Mrs. Edmonds graduated
from the Cooper Medical College and es
tablished an office in this city, gaining a
large practice, which she has held Cit
many years.
Last evening Miss Kdmonds was sent
for and came to the city from Berkeley j
on a late boat. The Coroner was notified |
and left the body at the residence psnd- j
ing an examination into the cause of i
death to-day. Deceased was Dorn in :
Maine and has relatives in Wisconsin.

HORSESE SHY AT
CHARLES FAIR'S
AUTOMOBILE
An Exciting Spin San j
Mateo Way.
IT STIRS UP THE ANIMALS. !
CURIOSITY ALMOST LEADS TO |
A SERIOUS ACCIDENT.
A Buggy Overturned and Two Boys j j
Thrown Out While Watching
the Approach of the Horse
less Carriage.
Charles L. Fair and his automobile |
caused considerable of a commotion yes- j
terday down San Mateo way. Mr. Fair j
is bood in make a trip to the Yosemite |
Valley with his machine, recently to- | j
Ported from the Bast, and lie is familiar
izing himself with the management of
t â  vehicle In order that he may not gd
stalled en route through lack of experi
ence. At the same time he is famlliariz- â 
mcc the residents of the outlying distrii ts :
with the appearance of the strange vt
hide, which is the precursor of mtiny
others of similar design which will soon
delight the people of San Francisco and
vicinity.
Accompanied by two ladies, Fair went
yesterday for a ride out on the San Bruno
road, his main object, aside from the t
pleasure of the outing, being to try his
automobile on the .grades. The day wr.s
warm and pleasant, and many ii"t ;or
tunate enough to possess one of these
unique carriages were taking advantage
of the perfect conditions for driving,
seated in buggies drawn by horses. As;
in well known the eQuine race, on this
J coast especially. h;is nol yet been for
; mally Introduced to i>s mysterious rival,
i and. judging from their actions, neither
has the majority of bipeds. Whenever
the automobile ranged up alongside a
bi ggy the horse attached to the old-style ;
vehicle shied away, but generally the |
driver controlled it without difficulty.
in several instances, however, serious
accidents were narrowly averted. A horse
attached to ;i buggy, in which was -â¢
an old couple, nearly overturned the rig!
Into the ditch. Another buggy containing
two boys was overturned, ditching its oc
cupants. In this case, however, the cu
riosity of the driver had as much to do 'â 
with the accident as the apparition of the
automobile. The driver was so busily en- i
gaged in watching the silently moving '
hi rseless carriage that he allowed his
i lines to fall slack, and when his horse j
; shied the wheels cramped, overturning >
I the rig. Beyond a few bruises the boys
w re not injure,], and after the buggy was ;
' righted they drove off as though nothing!
had happened.
These were the nearest approaches to I
accidents, notwithstanding the fact that'
hundreds of rigswere encountered. Horses'
unaccustomed n> the strange vehicle wen
naturally restive at its appearance, but as j
Mt makes very little noise they will soon
become accustomed to it and then all!
! danger of accidents will be passed.
The automobile promises soon to be a ,
' feature of th< country i".i,is. and the peo- j
pie residing thereon will soon cease to j
j stare when they see one approaching.
SALE OF AN IRON MINE.
Rockefeller Buys the Texedo Island
Property.
TACOMA, July 9.â The John D. Rocke
feller Interests have purchased th>' only
developed Iron mine on the Padfl< ast,
located on Texedo Island, on the British
Columbia coast. The purchnse was made
by the Monte Crlsto Mining Company,
which Rockefeller controls. It is believer 1 .
Pfesideni Hill of tho Great Northern
Railroad will join Rockefeller in develop
ing Pacific Coast Iron Interests. Hill has
long been planning steps in this direction,
and three weeks ago he had a conference
with Rockefeller at Everett.
The Texedo mines produce hpssemer ore
containing * ;< i per cent Iron. Their product
was v.-cd at th" Port Townsend blast fur
nace until it shut down. It is believed
thai the blast furnace which Rockefeller
will build will be located at Everett,
which townsite he owns, or Tacoma. This
city has the advantage of the only coke
supply in the State and rolling mills
w 1 iicli furnish a market for pig iron.

Cowes the keenest lookout was kept for
the challenger, which it was known would
Btretch her sails.
Every movement was veiled with the
profoundeet secrecy, and owint;" to the
rumors In circulation that her sails were
unsatisfactory the interest was intensi
lied. Newspaper men and photographers
gathered in large numbers and would i
have given anything to Know the pro- â 
gramme, but nothing was given out.
Sir Thomas Upton. deUgnted with his
new treasure, and the Brothers Jameson
were on board the Iverna. John Jameson s
cutter, and Will Fife, the designer of thd :
Shamrock, was much in evidence. :
In Southampton water the Shamrock
presented a magnificent sight. The slight
breeze was lust enough to 1111 her sails,
but she glided syjedily and as gracefully
ay a swan.
It should be understood that yesterday 3
trip was in no sense a test of speed; al
though the Ivema and Satanita accom
panied her. It was .solely for the purpose
of sail stretching. Very soon it became
apparent that there was not a shadow of
foundation for the unfavorable reports.
No doubt a few minor alterations will !â  â¢
found necessary, but the sails were pro
nounced generally excellent.
The helm trials to-day were even more
satisfactory, if possible, us she answered
all demands beautifully and without the
least trouble.
After passing Calshot Castle, she was
directed toward Cowes, where she was
eagerly scanned by crowds of experts al
' ready "arrived for the season. A distin
guished expert and yachting authority
said that the Shamrock was "the finest
yacht ever seen In the Solent."
Starting again she went along like a
shot out of a gun. heaving for the west
channel and Yarmouth. Then she re
turned toward Southampton. As she beat
up Southampton water with gaff topsail,
mainsail an foresail, she developed won
derful speed, although not after anything
regarding pace, finally anchoring off
Hythe, where she remains until to-mor
row, when she will take another spin ac
companied by the Iverna. A member of
the crew- said:
â â¢The Shamrock will do what she is built
for and will beat tne Columbia. She
sailed admirably, without a hitch, and
answered her helm to perfection, which
is one of the greatest considerations. We
are going to win, but it is impossible yet
to judge of the yacht's full capacity."
Sir Thomas Lipton expressed himself as
"satisfied with the spin."
Interest is now centered in the spins
with the Britannia: which will be ready
on Monday for at Last four encounters.
In yachting circles the opinion la general
that the Shamrock must beat the Britan
nia at least a half hour considering the
speed the Columbia developed in the races
with the Defender.

San Francisco Wins
Three Straight.
A SHUT-OUT OVER IN OAKLAND
â â¦ â
AN INTERESTING STRUGGLE AT
RECREATION PARK.
\ Haysesds Lead Off With Five Runs.
but Are Beaten Out by a
Series of Hits and
Errors.
Three straight victories, of which two
were shutouts, tell the story of the work
of Hank's hired men with WatsonvilJe
during the series just closed. There was
never a moment when the outcome was
in doubt in any of the games, and the
locals have amply demonstrated that
barring unforseen accidents they are right
In line for the pennant.
The morning game at Golden Gate was
a farce. The Hayseeds could do nothing
with Iberg. who seemed to have entirely
regained his effectiveness, and their own
bungles materially aided in the general
result.
In the afternoon at Recreation Park
Fireman Fitz officiated at the obsequies,
and after the first inning he was as invin
j cible as he was on the previous day.
There were several changes In the local
team owing to an injury sustained by
Swindells in the tirst Inning, necessitating
his retirement to the Held. Sullivan
donned the air package and demonstrat
ed that he is still fully capable of per
forming backstop work with discretion
and distinction.
The visitors started off with a rush, and
the big crowd of spectators fancied for a
short time that the locals were up against
it. but during the succeeding eight in
nings VVatsonville demonstrated thai it
had sounded a false alarm, and after the
Friscos began to wield their war clubs
there was no longer a doubt as to the
outcome.
Four swats and the fireman's wildness
gave the visitors five runs in the initial
inning, which caused the local rooters to
gasp, but after that they subsided and
did no further damage.
Harris' bunch secured a couple of tallies
in the second, another in the fourth, two
in the fifth and kept stringing them
along through the fifth, seventh and
eighth innings until they had wiped out
the lead of the Hayseeds and were two
runs to the good.
Harper pitched a good game and struck
out the fireman three times. Watson
ville managers are determined to have
a winning team in the field and happily
are not in the least discouraged by tke
latest string of defeats. They are now
in correspondence with a number of East
ern players, and in a short time they hope
to have the team reorganized. . The
scores of the two games are as follows:

JEFF SPARS WITH
"BROTHER JACK"
The Champion Starts for Los
Angeles to See His
Mother,
FIVE THOUSAND people, men women and children, yesterday enioyod
the honor of tramping over the treeless avenues of Glen Park in the
wake of the "only undefeated heavy-weight pugilist living, James J.
Jeffries, champion of the world." The crowd was there early, and it
was there apparently for no other purpose than to see and hear the
champion of all champions, for Jeff had been udvertlsed to make a speech.
They saw, but heard not, for Jeffries has not yet acquired the speech-mak
ing habit and evinces no desire to win the plaudits of the multitude by wag
ging his jaw.
Promptly at 3 o'clock Charles McCaull climbed through the trap door on
to the platform where the exhibition was to take place and announced that
the biggest star of the pugilistic firmament was about to shine for a few
brief moments, prefacing this announcement, however, with the very lucid
and satisfactory statement that Jeffries was more than anxious to tight his
(â¢(lining battle with Sharkey in San Francisco and would certainly do so, pro
vided San Francisco offered a bigger purse than any of the Eastern cities.
As McCaull reached his flrsi period Jack Jeffries appeared at the trap
door and the crowd began to yell, thinking it was the champion. The mis
take was discovered at once, however, and the cheers died away to break
out with renewed energy a moment later when the opening in the platform
was suddenly tilled with what appeared to be a whole bunch of fighters. A3
the bunch slowly squeezed Its way through the opening and straightened up
the cheers developed into a roar of approval and a broad grin of satisfaction
at the warmth of his reception overspread Jeffs features as he crawled
through the ropes.
The exhibition was a revelation to those of the spectators who saw Jef
fries spar for the first time since his return from the East. Jack Jeffries,
despite all his cleverness, did not land a clean blow on his big brother dur
ing the entire four rounds. In fact, the champion played with him as a
cat with a mouse. His ducking and marvelous quickness were astonish
ing, and the prediction was freely made when the bout was over that Shar
key and his "Dewey destroyer" would not be in it with Fitzsimmons' con
queror if the two ever came together.
At the conclusion of the exhibition Jeffries, his brother Jack, Hops O'Xeil
and C. B. McCaull started for Los Angeles. They crossed the bay and
boarded their train without being recognized by more than a half dozen peo
ple. They will return to San Francisco in time for Jeffries to spar at the
Reliance Club benefit in Oakland next Friday night. The trip to Los Angeles
at this time is principally due to Jeffries' desire to see his mother.

Hali Adali May Be Arrested.
CHICAGO, July Jt.-T.. M. Houseman of
this city said to-day that he would on
Monday apply for an injunction before
the United States Court to restrain the ar
pearnce of Hall Adali, the Turkish wrest
ler champion, under the management of
persons other than himself. Houseman
claims to have a two years' contract with
the Turk at a stated salary. The re
straining order, if issued, will' be directed
against Butte persons, who have offered
Hali more money than he is getting un
der his existing contract. An order of
arrest for obtaining money under false
pretenses. Mr. Houseman says, will be
prayed for. Houseman alleges that Hall
asked for and received his July salary in
advance, accepting it after having written
a letter declaring his intention to forth
with return to Turkey.

LOTTIE M WINS
IN FINE STYLE
AT UNION PARK
Her Third Victory in
Six Weeks.
SHE WAS HARDLY EXTENDED
FLUSH GETS INTO THE FINAL,
BUT IS WITHDRAWN.
He Is Slipped to a Strong Hare With
Brutus Previously and Both
Dogs Are Run to a
Standstill.
IT. Lynch's black wonder, Lottie M. won
the seventy-four-dng stake at T'nlon
Coursing Park yesterday as though It
were an exercise gallop f<>r her. This
is the third Make won by her in the past
six wc<-ks. In her only other start she
was runner-up t<> Gladiator.
Lottie M was not called upon to run the
final murse yesterday, as Flush, the dog
she should have met, was withdrawn. In
the tilth round Plush met Brutus, and the
pair were slipped to a strong hare. It
led them back and forth across the field
until the dogs were beaten off, and to
their lives a fresh greyhound was
released. He killed quickly. In the next
round Flush drew a bye and in order to
qualify for the final, which meant at least
second place, was compelled to run.
After a short rest he came out, but
showed by his open mouth and heaving
sides that he was still distressed. Walt
a Little was sent to the slips with him,
and happily kill.-d quickly. After a
straight run-up he snapped up the hare,
rolling over and over like an acrobat.
This course placed Flush in the final, but
he was withdrawn, as in his exhausted
condition a severe course meant death.
Lottie M won the stake in the sixth
round, when she met Twin City Girl. At
the first attempt the hare turned to the
right suddenly and both dogs lost sight
of him. They ran about aimlessly for a
time, but were caught by their handlers
before any harm was done. The second
hare was a strong one and made straight
for the escapes. It was Lottie M all the
way. She led by a dozen open lengths,
the* Girl getting one turn when the hare
turned back just before making good its
escape.
In the eighteen courses run off during
the morning not a single short-ender won.
This is the first time this has happened
since the opening of the park. As though
to make amend- for this, a number of
short-enders raised flags In the next
round. Kmin Pasha, 3 to 1, beat Mialmo
after a brilliant run-up. Candelaria, 2 to
1, beat Master Clair. Master Clalr had
the speed, but was kept on the outer cir
cle of the hare's course and could not
score. Prince Hal. Lowe and Thompson's
big dog, beat Susie at 2 l j to 1. The Flush-
Emm Pasha race was a heavy betting
one, the former leading up and getting
the first turn, while Emm Pasha secured
two wrenches and the kill.
Flush started against Brutus at 5 to 1
and won. This was the longest course of
the day. AVhen Twin City Girl won from
Mac's Melody she was on the short end
at 2 to 1 and nobody wanted her. She
won handily. The detailed results of the
day's sport follow:

Game in Yuba County.
MARYSYILLE, July 9.â On and after
next Saturday, July 15, it will be lawful
to kill cloves and deer in Yuba County.
From all sections come reports of plenty
of doves. The birds are unusually thicic
in the foothills, and almost every scrub
oak bush holds a dove's nest. Now that
harvesting is under way the birds will
begin to work down into the grain fieUU.
As for quail, the season has been a very
pood one. The river bottoms are full of
bands of half-grown birds, and parties
from the foothills say they have not seen
so many young birds in their section in
years. The birds hatched early this sea
son, and by October 1. when the season
opens, they will be fully grown. Pheas
ants, which are comparatively now in
this section, are becoming ouite plentiful.

TRUTH TOLD BY TOURISTS

CANNOT BUILD A CITY ON
CHEA.tÂ» POLITICS.
"Water Front a Treasury the Key to
Which Demagogues and De
stroyers Will Never
Find.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 9.
Somewhere I have read, "Come, let us
reason together." Apparently they obey
this injunction In some places, but never j
In Oakland. This permanent ignoring of j
such sage advice is brought 01:1 prom- !
inently just noxv by reason of the return
of a few Intelligent Oaklanders from the
East. They have seen something greater I
â than Oakland, they have noticed a few:
ideas broader than those prevailing here
and they all tell the same story- God has
done everything; Oakland has loafed.
George D. Met calf is one of these tour- j
ists. In expressing his ideas he used the
following words:
The most common thought that cornea to a.
resident of Oakland who appreciates Oakland |
ana endeavors to compare It with Eastern cities
of the same size or smaller, Is that Oakland is |
beyond all question far richer in natural ad- i
vantages than any of them, but is poverty- j
stricken in what her Inhabitants have done i
her.
Oakland as a city, from location and sur- j
roundings, ought to be par excellence the nioÂ»t
beautiful in the country, but as a matter ot
fact it is twenty-five years behind the times
and is inferior to many Eastern cities of one
half its population in all those things that go
to make an attractive, progressive, live place.
We have all the natural advantages here, but
are woefully lacking in the progressive spirit
of fhe ape. What Oakland needs more than
anything rise is that the people should awaken
not only to a proper sÂ«Â»nse and just appreciation
of what they have, but to the possibilities In
perfecting what they have.
â â â 
Another leading man, John L. Howard,
whose ideas are all commercial, expressed
himself a couple of days ago in language
that is as truthful as it is plain. He said: |
Oakland is the sleeping apart of San
Francisco, and i, seems as If it was poms to '
stay asleep as far as branching out commer
daily is concerned. The people show a lack
of interest In developing the resources of the I
city. I know of no city of a population cf j
70.000 which has the commercial opportunities
of this city that has done so little in that
direction.
For example, Oakland is thirty odd years :
old and there is only one private wharf at
which ships can land. Th? city own? two small I
piers, and that constitutes the entire list of j
our facilities for doing commerce.
The harbor should be â â¢â¢â .: estuary
should be dredged. a retaining wall built and
the water front land reclaimed by tilling in
with the mud trom the dredging.
There is no reason why cargoes should not !
be shipped and landed at this port directly
instead of transferring at San Francisco, as la
dene at present. _
A S. McDonald, who stands in the lead j
of Oakland real estate men. h?.s also just
returned from a larger world than Oak
land, and he voices a few truths as fol- â 
lows:
The prominence given by all the great East- i
err. cities to parks and boulevards is something
that Oakland might note and Imitate with ad
vantage. I should like to transport our City
Council arrl officials and certain taxpayers to
cities where they could see thousands of people >
of all clashes enjoying and using these present !
apparently amrl" public driveways and breath- j
ing placfs, and ihen have them note the move j
ments on toot for more of them. A man en the
returning train asked me what 1 had to show !
him In Oakland. 1 had to reply nothing, except ;
that Oakland is a sort cf park arid garden in j
itself, thr.t nature hnd done much for us while .
we as yet have done nothing.
I come back, though, full of the highest hopes
for Oakland. We are on the threshold of great .
things here. I should be afraid to tell all the i
things that I now foresee for our city and sec- j
tlon for fear of startling people. Still, some j
people need startling. There are such people |
even in Oakland. ;
There are one or two practical or specific con
siderations, besides these general ones, that Ij
bring back to Oakland from my hasty trip |
through the Eastern cities. One is the matter ,
of binding a town for public Improvements and i
for public purposes. Cleveland, not very many !
years ago when its population was 35,000,
bonded itself for $4/<>''.ooo; all of that sum. mini
jÂ»ou, for the purpose of securing, subsidizing, if
you will, manufacturers and transportation â¢
lines. One site, together with a quarter of a
million dollars, was given outright to a single '
manufacturing concern. Well, Cleveland now
has twelve great railroads and its population
is 300.000. Does this look as though Oakland j
ought to lie afraid of Mayor Snow's modest
million dollar bonding plan
"Same old thing." every Oaklander no j
doubt said when he read these gentle- j
men's remarks. The â  expression Is Flgj- j
rificant. It is the same old thing, and j
just so long as this city permits a Creator j
to do all the work and not bear its share j
of the burden it will always be the same I
old thing. It surely is not too much to
expect that people who have as much in- '
telligence along ordinary lines as have
Oaklanders should get together and rea- '
son once in a while. I do not mean gath- ,
er at an official's house, sample his wine,
eat his turkey and spend two or three !
hours debating over the making or break- J
ing of a policeman. What is necessary is
that the men who are. perforce, inter-;
ester] in the progress of the city, where
their money and interests lie; should come >
together and reason in the same spirit ;
and on the same practical basis as would
the partners in a firm regarding any large -I
mercantile transaction.
It seems foolish, as it Is stale, to repeat j
any, if the tremendous advantages that !
exist In this city simply waiting for the \
public spirit to profit by them. Down on I
the water front (which to any other city j
would be a public treasury) a large grain j
firm is now erecting a mammoth ware
house. This move should have been made, !
speaking progressively, the signal for a !
hie civic demonstration, with bands and j
banners and all the legitimate hullaballoo
that modern, wideawake people have of |
calling attention to their Importance. !
Should this one warehouse prove a sue- j
ieessful venture (and he shrewd firm that !
is building it ha no doubt satisfied itself j
on this point), it can only mean one thing!
â one by one ail the large grain kings of
Port Costa, Benicia and Crockett must .
follow suit, and have a warehouse offer-!
ing the same advantages as their compet- 1
itor in Oakland. For yearn shipping men â 
have debated the possibility of bringing <
wharf and rail together at a nearer point
than Port Costa. During the last three j
years this has actually been done in Oak- !
land, and yet probably not one person in j
a thousand in the State of California is j
aware of this fact. At the same time I
venture to gamble that every town in the â 
State, and possibly every citizen, regards j
Oakland as a political bear-garden, with i
no higher aims in view than chasing '
shadows and quarreling over apparitions. j
"Oakland has a grand future," is the
heading, In large type, over a valuable
article in the Tribune. This is the great !
trouble. Oakland is always preparing for
the next generation Instead of determin-
Ing that it shall have a present as well
as a future. Some one else, during tne.
week, called attention to the fact that 1
Oakland is now thirty years old, and yet
its great source of wealth, the water '
front, is about as useful as a means of
producing income as it was when shrewd j
old Carpenter gave his old wharf and |
iolhouse for it. ;
There is but one thing to make a city
greatâ work. The only thing that can
bring work to Oakland Is the development
of the water front by the cstablismcnt of |
large industries. For a generation peo- j
Pie with petty political ideas have sought j
to maks capital out of all manner of agl- j
tations. Had the movements been con
ceived in good faith they would have
proved a benefit, but no agitations pro
fessionally concocted have ever proved a
benefit. It has been the ambition of every
demagogue who has had a hand in con- j
trollng the affairs of this city to be con- j
tented with a policy of destruction Their ;
motto has been. "Pull down^ while no
one has mad.- a healthy, legltimat.
fort to build up. This Is why men go
East and come back expreMing such
ideas as I have already quotea.

PACIFICS WIN.
Californias Lose a Pennant Match the
First Time This Season.
The hitherto unbeaten California Crick- !
et Club met with its first defeat yester
day on the Alameda ground. After send- ,
ing their opponents, the Pacifies, whose (
strength lies in batting, to the bat first |
and getting them all out for the moderate
total of 91 runs, the Californias failed to
reach that number and lost the match' by
eighteen runs.
J. Myers and C. Simmonds went to the
wickets first for the Pacifies and made
no good a defense that 49 runs were reg- ;
istered before Myers was caught off
Dickinson. In the next over Simmonds was
out leg before wicket to Dickinson, and j
no one else made any stand except G.
Theobald 10 and J. H. Harbour 13. Dick- |
inson bowled successfully throughout, j
taking six of the eight Pacific wickets for i
i an average of not quite six runs per wick- ;
et.
When the Californias went to the wick- '
ets E. G. Sloman was run out for 24 runs. I
ar.d A. Dickinson was ( aught off Harbour ,
for 11. A. D. Reynold made a good stand,
scoring 23. but he received no support, and
the innings closed for 73 runs, nineteen
short of the number necessary for a vic
tory. C Simmonds bowled very well,
taking six wicket? for 26 runs.
There being me little time left after
the conclusion of the Californias 1 inning, 1
the Pacifies went to the bat again, J.
Myers and C. Simmonds facing the bowl
ers. Myers was caught after scoring I
seven runs, but Simmonds. nn being joined j
by Coles scored freely, and at call of time

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JULY 10, 1899.
McELROY, THE
DIAMOND THIEF,
IS AT LIBERTY
Mrs. Weld Refuses to
Prosecute.
WILL NOT COME FROM BOSTON
STOLEN JEWELRY NOW IN POS
SESSION OF CHIEF LEES.
Chief Kipley of Chicago Has Been No
tified of the Lady's Decision
and Has Released the
Thief.
Lewis McElroy. ex-porter in the Hotel
Richelieu, who was arrested in Chicago
for stealing $3000 worth of diamonds from
the trunk of Mrs. "William G. Weld, a
guest at the hotel In May last, will not
be brought back to stand his trial for the
crime.
Mrs.' Weld, who is a wealthy widow in
Boston, had gone to' the Yosemite, leav
ing her diamonds in a bag in one of her
trunks. She returned on May 30, and dis
covered that during her absence the
trunk containing her diamonds had been
rifled. -She notified the police. Detectives
Dinah and "Wren were detailed on the
case. McElroy had left the hotel prior
to Mrs. Weld's return, and the detectives
suspected him of the theft. They dis
covered that he had got a friend, J. Mc-
Henry, to ship the parcel, on June 26,
through Wells-Fargo's office in Oakland
to him at the St. Charles Hotel. 15 South
Clark street. Chicago, and Chief Lees got
General Manager Titus of Wells-Fargo
to wire hi? agent there to reship the pack
age to Wm. He got a reply on July 1
. that the package had been reshipped. and
I it arrived here a few days ago, and Is
now in the possession of the Chief. It
contains all the missing jewels. The value
put by McElroy's friend on the contents
was $50.
Chief Lees received a dispatch on July
3 from Chief Kipley of Chicago that Mc-
Elroy had been arrested there, and Lees
replied that as the complaining witness
was not here he would not be in a posi
tion to forward any instructions till he
located her. On July 7 Chief Kipley
wired that he would have to release Mc-
Elroy unless something was done, and the
same day the Chief got a dispatch from
Mrs. Weld, who had returned to Boston,
asking him to forward the jewels to her
i for identification. The Chief replied that
!it was absolutely necessary for her to
come here and testify against McElroy,
otherwise he would be discharged. She
replied that she could not come here, and
did not care to prosecute, and the Chief
on Saturday wired Chief Kipley to dis
charge McElroy. as the complaining wit
ness refused to prosecute.
Mrs. Weld wants her diamonds back,
but Chief Lees Is at present of the opin
ion that she cannot get them unless she
comes here to identify them. It is possi
ble, however, thai some procedure in
court may be taken so that she can have
them without being put to the expense
and delay of coming here.
M'COY TO FIGHT TWO
BATTLES IN SEPTEMBER
One of His Antagonists Will Be
Choynski. and the Other Corbett
or Fitzsimmons.
NEW FORK. July 9.â "Kid" McCoy has
I by the Westchester Athletic
Club to meet any two men during the
month of September. His first fight will
be with .J". Choynski, who has wired
Homer Selby bis aceptance of the $7500
offered by the Westchester Cltrt>.
Tiie date chosen for the light is Septem
ber 2.
Mr. Gray will choose either Fitzsim
mons or Corbett as the other opponent for
McCoy in September, and a most liberal
â  . offer will be made for either
of these men to meet the Indianlan on
Sept 1 mber 23.
In a letter to the club's matchmaker
McCoy says I;*- would be more than
pleased to tight Corbett or Fitzsimmons,
and would allow them to name their own
terms as to a division of the purse. Mc-
Coy has evidently recovered his good
form and is anxious to resume his suc
cessful career in the ring.
This offer will no doubt be acceptable to
; "Lanky Hob," provided the purse is large
enough.
MINOR BASEBALL.
Bakersfield Defeats Fresno in a Close
t Contest.
BAKERSFIELD, July P.â Bakersfield
defeated Fresno in the Valley League
game here to-day by a score of 4 to 3.
The game was the best ever seen on the
local diamond. Until the eighth inning
the score stood Fresno I, Bakersfield 1.
On Millard's wild throw to first and
Eberle's error Fresno got in two men and
the Bakersfleld rooters were attacked by
an epidemic of nervous prostration.
Bakersfield failed to connect in its half
of the eighth and Fresno looked like a
winner. BaKersfield took the stick, tilled
the baser, and Smith dropped a three
bagger near the fence. This ended the
agony. . A crowd raised Smith on its
shoulders and made a triumphant march
to town. Smith pitched an errorless game
for Bakersfleld and won the game in the
last half of the ninth by his tnree-bagger.
Munroe pitched a good game for Fresno,
but was batted harder than Smith.
Fresno's catcher. Swartz. was Injured by
a pitched ball in tne second inning, but
plucklly finished the game with but one
passed ball,

CROSS COUNTRY RUN.
Olympic Club Members Hoof It to
Lone Pine and Back.
An enjoyable cross country run was on
joyed yesterday by a crowd of Olympic
Club cross* country trampers and hill
climbers under the guidance of Captain
George James. They started from Mill
Valley In the morning and crossed the
divide, down Redwood Canyon and over
Willow Camp to Lone Pine and return**;!
to Mill Valley, where they enjoyed a feast
at the expense of the club.
The trail was a rough one and some of
the athlete* fared poorly before the end
was reached. Several of the boys lost
the trail and straggled in in time to see
the advance guard linishing their dinner,
while another brigade which came in
minus the marks of a hard trip was ac

NEGRO STRIKES AN
AGED WHITE WOMAN
Citizens of San Miguel Threaten to
Summarily Punish the
Culprit.
SAN MIGUEL. July B.â That the hand
of a man dare strike a woman feeble anil
bent with the weight of seventy odd
years and the wrong go unavenged for
more than a week was brought to light
to-day by the arrest at Paso Robles of
James Hunter, a colored man, who, up
to within a few days ago, was employed
as cook and runner for the Levinger Ho
tel at this place.
The Levinger Hotel is. conducted by
James I*. Meadows, a man in poor health,
and the main care of the place rests upon
his wife and Mrs. Smith, her mother,
both frail little women. If appears- that
Mrs. Smith and ' the cook 8 . week ago
were in the- kitchen, when a discussion en
sued over some trivial matter. Before the
old lady was aware of her peril Hunter
struck her f a severe blow with the back
of the hand over her right eye. terribly
bruising and discoloring, the right' aide of
her face. Mrs.' Smith grasped at a sink
near by, else she would have been felled
by the blow. , â¢' :
The Meadows were told of the cruel as
sauit," but for various reasons they
preferred to hush the matter up. One of
the reasons, no doubt, was the. justifiable
fear that if it became known outside of
the hotel the brute would have paid for
his dastardly act with .his life, coupled
with the fact, also, thai th" excitement
of such a summary method of meting out
lubtice might have proved fatal., to . one
in so delicate -health at-. Mr. Meadows. â 
Hunter was arraigned before Justice
Perry to-day upon a ' charge of 'assault,
and released upon .bonds. his trial being
set for 'Monday* -morning.' Even .now it
is hinted that the" law may nut be allowed
to take Its rather tardy course. â¢ â  -- â -

FLORENCE WARREN DIVORCED.
Millionaire's Daughter Freed From a
Non-Supporting Husband.
TACOMA, July 9. â A divorce was grant
ed yesterday to Florence Mifflin Warpn,
daughter ol General J. M. Hood, the Bal
timore millionaire, and president of the
Western Maryland Railroad. The wed
ding of the Warrens was a swell society
function, occurring at Baltimore two
years ago. They spent a year in Colum
bus, <>Â moving here a year ago. She al
leged Warren had done nothing' toward
supporting her here and she believed lie
married her with the expectation that her
parents would support them. Her father
objected to supporting Warren without
any effort on his part, and accordingly
supplied only the money necessary for
his daughter's support. Warren naving
failed to get any of his father-in-law's
money they separated in April last. War
ren made no objection to the divorce.
Mrs. Warren's younger sister corrobo
rated her testimony and they took last
night's train for California. Mrs. War
ren resumes her maiden name.
SEAL HERD DECREASING.
Not One-Tenth the Numbe_ of Former
Years.
SEATTLE, July 9.â E. W. ('lark, who is
a special agent of the Government in
charge- of the Seal Islands in Kcrinp Sen,
arrived here to-day. He left the islands
June H. He said:
"The provisions of the Paris tribunal
are totally Inadequate. I nm confident
thai seal life is not one-tenth as great as
in former years. The destruction of the
herd is still progressing- under pelagic
sealing. About three out of every five
killed are recovered, the other two sink
ing. Fully three female seals are killed
to two males."
Mr. Clark reports there were no pelagic
sealers around the islands when he left.
!i\;t he was told that the fleet had gath
ered and was following the seal herd on
Its return from southern waters. He also
reports a big salmon catch along the
Aleutian Islands. â¢
TAX ON PUBLIC UTILITIES.
License Ordinance Proposed by Red
Bluff's Trustees.
REDDING, July 9.â The recent enact
ment of a city ordinance In Woodland im
posing a license tax of $2.50 per annum on
every insurance company doing business
in that city has been followed by similar
action on the part of the Hoard of City
Trustees of Redding. An amendment to
the municipal code carrying an insurance
license of $2.50 a year has passed first
reading and will become a law. Red Bluff
has taken action on an ordinance licensing
telegraph companies at $10 quarterly, ex
press, telephone, electric light and gas
companies at $25 quarterly and water and
insurance companies at $100 quarterly. An
ordinance covering these items will come
up for passage at the next meeting of the

of the view of newspaper men as much
as 'possible.

tion, returned to New York this morning.
GUATEMALA IS
IN THE THROES
OF DISCONTENT
â¦â¢ â
Government Marked
by Disorders.
DEPARTMENTS UNOFFICERED
WRETCHED FINANCIAL CONDI
TION 13 THE CAUSE.
Arrival of Prominent Central Ameri
cans Confirm the Stories of Im
pending Turbulence and
Present Destitution.
â¦ -
The steamer San Juan, which reached
this port, early last evening, had a num
ber of prominent Guatemalans aboard. !
who are of one voice In a tale of govern- \
mental and financial distress and an tm- :
pending public uprising. Stormy times are
ahead for the Central American repub
lics, and, judging from appearances, Guat
emala will again !>â¢ rent by civil dissen
sion and internecine strife.
The presnt distress is said to be the
natural and logical outcome of the finan
cial system of the country. Last October I
arrangements were made t" tl- >n t a paper
issue of 16,000.000. Hills were issued in
January, and from thai time to the pr> s
ent $2,000,000 worth of comparatively value
less paper was sent out. As most of the
business conducted with foreign traders
is don.- through sight drafts on the United
States, that medium of exchange rias
jumped to enormous values. The nominal
ciuotation on United States sight drafts
reaches a *>uo per cent premium, but the
nun who arrived here last night say it is
far above that. Ac<-r>rding to their state
ments a sight draft on this Government is
hardly purchasable with the currency of
Guatemala.
The inflation of paper money, in which
the people place no trust, is at the bottom
of the governmental evil. Tales of puffer
ing and destitution come from all over the
country. One of the most prominent plant
ers, who is now In this city, said last
night:
"The currency, combined with the sur
plus production of coffee, explains the
conditions. Of late years every bit of ara
ble land has been used for the growth of
coffee, with a result that there is over
production. The coffee growers them
selves will not be the great sufferers, tor
they trade directly with America and re
ceive gold in exchangi for their products.
The poorer classes fe< 1 the iron hand, as
they receive in turn money which Is of
no genuine value compared with Its face
denomination. Conditions may be (hanged
in time by the enforced- disuse of many
acres of coffee lands, but the real cause
of the trouble is in the finance.
President Cabrera is now at the helm
in Guatemala and he will have to rid. a
heavy storm before he lands his ship En
a safe port. 11. E. Hockmeyer, I>r. Fran
cisco J. Medina, a banker, and A. Ratter
are the three influential Guatemalans, who
arrived last night. Bach one was lost
in a cloud taciturnity and preferred not
to be interviewed.
Letters received in this city last night
bespeak the tottering of the ('nbrean ad
ministration. It seems that three depart
ments have gone begging for men to MI
them. At present, according to informa
tion received, there arc no Secretaries of
tin Treasury. Foreign Relations and Pul>
lic Works.
Though the bait has been proffered, no
one cerr.s willing to take the hook.
Cabrera is charged with having ordered
the coinage of a silver standard piece,
600 fine in place of 835 line. This brought
a Htorm about his ears and he laid the
blame upon the superintendent of the
mint, who now lfes in jail.
In order to adjust matters ( "abrera
made a demand upon the banks for sub
sidles of silver. This was refused with
the result of the expulsion of President
Rc.cenda Devella of the Hank of Colom
bia r>nd the forced flight of Alexander
Abrahmson of the Rank of America.
Silver has been made contraband. Ail
Guatemalans who attempt to ship it are
apprehended and Incarcerated. Ameri
cans doing so are invited to shake the
dust -f Guatemala off their feet.
News comes from Washington that the
Guatemala!) Consul, Antonio Laxo Ar
riHgo. intends to return to his own coun
try to recover $lS,(tOo back salary. This
will leave his country without a repre
sentative at Washington. Judging from
present conditions Guatemala is on the
brink of a great upheaval.

TACOMA, July Â».â Over 50,000 acres "f
the best timber land in Skajdt and Sno

BURGLARS MAKE
A RAUL IN A
JEWELRY STORE
Enter by Way of the
Transom.
VALUABLE STOCK TAKEN
â -â¢ â
A THIRTEEN-YEAR-OLD BOY ONE
OF THE CULPRITS.
The Police Have a Description of the
Crooks and Are Confident of
Soon Apprehending
Them.
I
One <>f the most daring burglaries re
ported to the police for some time was
committed yesterday morning in a jewelry
store kept by William Schepjrier at ]<>71
Markei street. The thieves succeeded In
getting away with jewelry valued ut $350.
Shortly after 3 o'clock the policeman on
the beat saw a. suspicious looking charac
ter standing a few feet from the .-tore.
He was accompanied by a boy, who,
I catching a glimpse of the police officer,
walked down the street. The man dis
appeared shortly afterward, and conclud
ing that he had left the scene the guard
lan of the peace continued on his beat.
When he returned about an hour later
he found pieces of broken glass scattered
about the entrance, and convinced ti>.it
there was something wrong he proce<?d<?<J
to mak" an investigation. After a cur
sory examination he discovered that burg- j
lars had ent< red the store through tli"
transom and carried off a number of
watches and chains and other articles of
jewelry. He at once notified the proprt-
I etor. who. after examining his stock, es
timated his loss at about $000.
The detectives who Â«re working on the
I case are satisfied that the man and boy
who were seen hanging around the store
committed the burglary.
It is their opinion that the transom was
broken with a heavy cane and the boy
shoved through the aperture by his older
j companion, who waited outside until the
I youthful criminal gathered a? much jew
i elry as he could conveniently carry and
! then assisted him through the broken
! transom.
A citizen who was passing at the time
I saw the pair standing in the entrance of
: the store, but thinking they were wait
ing for a friend paid Kttle attention to i
them.
He describes the boy as being about 13
years of age, shabbily dresned. He did
not get a loofc at his companion, as th<
latter turned his back to him as he pass
ed them.
Last night a description of the stolen
articles were furnished the police, and
every effort will In made to apprehend
the daring crooks.

â¦
Two. groups of boys and a sun they ;
"didn't know was loaded" formed a com- j
Mnation near Hay wards yesterday muni- i
ing, which may result fatally. One of i
ilie lad is wounded "almost beyond hope,
of recovery, another may lose the sight, ut j
an eye and a third is a "prisoner in thej
Alameda County Jail.
Bernard and James Killi..?; an.l John :
Gallagher went to a canyon near Hay- !
wards several days aj:o to camp. Kariy j
yesterday morning Joseph L*Jesh and two ;
companions went to the camp to join the ,
others for a day's sport. They found i
them in the tent lying on the ground
wrapped in blankets. I<oesh took a sun
out of the tent and was handling it,, not j
Knowing it was loaded: It suddenly ex- j
plodedj the charge going through i lie can
vas and striking? two of the lads inside.] ;
.The elder Kiliun was struck on thÂ« fore- I
head and the top of his head was blown
â off. Gallagher was lot in the eye. Jim ; .
Killian wati not injured.
The two victims of the accident were- ;
taken to the County Infirmary anil iater ; ;
Gallagher v. as s. m home. JvililKii was j
unconscious; and the doctors at once said
that death must follow in a short time.
Joseph JLoesh was arrested and taken to
The jail in Oakland to await develop
ments, t :
â¢â We are old friends," said Loesh at the
.iail. "and have known each other a long ;
time. Jimmie and Bernie Killian and John .
Gallagher have been camping there some
time, ami last night 1 went out with Wil- |
lie Wright and jack Rodgers to have a â 
day's fun. We arrived at their tent, a lew i
miles from wards, about half-pi 6
o'clock this morning^ and found the three â¢
boys in bed. We joshed them a few min
ute-; about b<>ing in bed SI â  late, and men ;

gun. so that we could go off and have
a few shots.
"He said he would, anu 1 found two ] â 
L-tins on a box in a corner of the tent. He I
told me that the left trigger was broken;
and that he had lost sumo good shots bo- :
cause of it. He said that the other trigger
was in good shape and that it did goou ',

ed or unloaded, and 1 took it outside the
tent to examine it. i saw it was useless
to try to do anything with the left trig- .
ger, "and then 1 examined the right one.
The- gi:n is a breech-loader and 1 had no I
idea that there were any shells in it. ;
"The three boys were lying on blankets
inside the tent, nut the nap was closed so .
that we could not see each other. \\ c I
continued to talk about the gun; and white {
I was handling the good trigger the gun ;
went off. i thought it was unloaded and
did not know it was not till the shell ex- '
"The shut went through the canvas and
instantly there was a yell inside. V. c,
â¢who were outside, could not see what the
shots had struck; but a few seconds later
Gallagher ran out with his hand over hi?
eve from which htood was pouring.
Jimmie lian also ran out and said that
Bernie was led.
â â I almost fainted with excitement at :
the thought of what i had done, ami i
looking in the tent saw that the top of |
Bernie's head was one mass of blood. He i
could not answer me when 1 spoke; and
1 did not know for a few minutes hat I
â was doing. All I remember was that I
feared I had killed my friend. We rushed
for help as soon as we were able.
"Gallagher could Ik, and he told me
lie was ouite sure that it was all acci
dental.V
The shot struck Killian square li in->i
middle of the forehead and tore off thÂ° ]
top of hi? head. Gallagher will probably i
lose his eye. although the shots may have j
.hit him high enough to save it.
When the infirmary doctors said ihnt |
they feared Killian would die Marshal |
Harhage arrested Loesh. but he has a&- |
Mired him that the shooting was an ai - i
Dr. Clark examined the wounded lad at
the County Infirmary and at once <=:iid
that young Killian had not one chance in i
a thousand to recover. There was a piece
of the scalp as large as the hand blown i
off ami a hole in the skull about the size j
of a half-dollar, through which the brain i
matter protruded.
John Gallagher was suffering from a :
t=evero wound in the left eye. Whet
or not the accident will cost him the si_ h'
of the eye cannot yet be determined.
After his wound had been dressed he was
able to be moved to his home; 836 Tele
graph avenue, Oakland, where his father,
N. Gallagher, conducts a grocery store.
Drs. Hamlin and Brlnkerhoff wore imme
diately summoned to attend 'him. but
found the wound so much inflamed that
it will bo several days perhaps before the
true extent of his injury can be ascer
tained. Hi is 17 years of aÃOâ about na i
old as his companions. He views the .sari ]
nffair as purely accidental, as do his com- |
panions.

the surgeons at the hospital regarded the
case as being beyond medical assisstance
the enterprising steward telephoned to
Coroner Hill, who lives only a short dis

had some important information to im
part to him.
Hill Immediately repaired to the hos

room asked who had telephoned to him.
Cohen did not recognize the Coroner, and
proceeded to ask him his business.
"1 am the Coroner." remarked Hill, dis

satisfying himself that nobody was lis

Cohen, "who is all but out. He's a dead

RICHMOND UP IN ARMS.
_ â
Property Owners Protest Against the
Removal of Their Only Fire
Engine.
A rousing meeting of the residents of
the Richmond district was held last even
ing in Richmond Hall, at the corner of
Fourth avenue and Clement street, to pro
test against the cutting down of the an
nual appropriation for thÂ»Â» Fire Depart
ment.
George R. Fletcher, president of the.
Point l.obos Improvement Club, presided
and William P. Thompson acted as secre
tary. In a brief address outlining the
object of the gathering Fletcher declared
that he had been informed by the pres
ident of the Board of Fire Commission
ers on Friday that as a result of the
action of the Supervisors the department
would have to get along less seventeen
fire companies, trucks, chemicals, etc.,
and '.hat among the number to be dis
pensed with was Engine Company No. 26,
which constitutes Richmond's sole pro
tection against fire. If this was done, the
speaker declared, the Insurance companies
would at once cancel their contracts and
double their rates. He urged that under
the circumstances the Supervisors be peti
tioned to Increase the appropriation for
the Fire Department. He defended the
action of the Supervisors In cutting down
the appropriation as they were only striv
ing to live up to their pledges, but lie
contended that in the present Instance the
people could afford to ask them to disre
gard the dollar limit. â¢..,i-
John J. Cassidy. James H. Dever. Phillip
.1 Ward, J. E. Owens and George Lake
spoke along the same lines, and Mr.
(.â¢wens offered the following resolutions,
which were adopted with a whoop:
Whereas, Owing to the honorable the Board
of Supervisors carrying out of the pledge Â«
acted of them by the people at the last elec
tion to conduct the city on the dollar limit: ami
Whereas, In the currying out of this pledge
it has reduced the appropriation for the main
tenance of the Fire Department to such an
extent that it has virtually crippled this most
needed and necessary department; an.l
Whereas In the conducting of tins depart
ment upon the appropriation allowed them by
the Board of Supervisors, in the carrying out
of this said dollar limit, the Board or Fire
Commissioners has found it a necessity to abol
ish engine company No. 26, among other tire
companies; and
Whereas By the abolition of engine company
No 26 it would deprive this, the Richmond
'District of any and all Ore protection, there
by leaving this large and growing district en
tirely to the mercy of a conflagration; there-
f Mrt i i .<â â¢ it That we. the residents and tax-
Rrsolved That \vp thf resident! nu<l tax
navers of' the Richmond District, in mass
meeting assembled, do petition the honorable
the Board of Supervisor* to reconsider the
pledge taken by them regarding the dollar
limit in so far as the I-'ire Department is con
cerned and we ask that they will add â  suffi
cient amount to the tax levy that the needs of
the Fire Department require, bo as to Insure to
the people that protection ngalnsl this grim
destroyer, fire.
Mr Cassidy moved that a committee
of five be appointed by the chair to seek
the support of the Merchants' Associa
tion and appear before the Supervisors
this afternoon to urge the necessity of a
reconsideration of the appropriation for
the Kire Department. The motion was
adopt and the chair named the follow
ing- ,) J. Cassidy. Ed Ginley. Phillip J.
Ward J. K. Owens and 1- G. McMullen.
It was suggested by Mr. Dover that a
committee of twenty be appointed to act
in conjunction with the committee of five i
when the descent was made upon the
Supervisors to show them that the peo- ',
ple of the Richmond district were a unit j
in demanding protection from fire. This
suggestion was Improved upon by the.
chair appointing everybody present a
committee to wait upon the Supervisors.
Fully a hundred announced their inten
tion of Joining the army of petitioners
which will march to the City Hall to-day.

DAIRYMEN ME
IMPOSED UPON
BY A FRAUD
Charles A. Bennett Is
Arrested.
Charles A. Bennett, whose swindling op- 1
erations among dairymen in Gilroy were
published exclusively In The Call of June
2S was arrested yesterday morning by
Detectives Fitzgerald and Graham and
taken to the City Prison. The Gilroy au
thorities were promptly notified and in the
afternoon Constable John E. White ar
rived and left with the prisoner.
Bennett lived with his wife at 4124 ,
Eighteenth street, where a truck load of
the cheese? he had obtained from dairy
men had been stored. He was careful
not to show himself on the street, as he
knew thai M. McCurrie. assistant secre
tary of the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals, whose father-in-law
was one of the victims, knew him and
would arrest him on sight
Yesterday morning McCurrie and the
two detectives went to the house, but
could not get admittance. They sent a |
boy to the house with a message that :
Bennett was wanted at the telephone in |
a store on the corner. He "â¢bit." and \
as soon as he made his appearance he ,
wns placed under arrest. He protested,
but when he saw the warrant sworn to
by H Brem, one of his victims, he weak
ened and accompanied them to the prison. j
Bennett is under the impression that j
because he we.nt Into Insolvency he can
not be prosecuted criminally, but the j
warrant for his arrest was sworn out on I
July 3 three days before he filed his in
solvency papers. His liabilities are given
as $2599 and his assets nil.
Bennett went among the dairymen rep
resenting that he was manager for the
Western Dairymen's Exchange, 22* Clay |
street, and pot consignments of dairy
produce on that representation. It was
discovered that the. Western Dairymen"*
Exchange was a myth ami that Bennett
had merely the privilege of having his |
mail sent there. The place Is occupied |
by 1 tollman & Co.
Among his victims are. besides R. I
Brem. who swore, out the warrant. George
Schr. pfer. Carlen Willson. R. Eschen- 1
burn and others. Eschenhurg was the j
hrst to discover the fraud, and he came ;
to this city, found out Bennett and after .
considerable trouble succeeded in obtain
ing his money.

aggregate tonnage of 57,556. met with :
