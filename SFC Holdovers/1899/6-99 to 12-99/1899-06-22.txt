for this city, passed out of a lethargic
business life :tt a Sheriff sale on the
Courthouse steps this morning. At its mm
m the company purchased ",2*) acres
of land from Friaco Fisher at the Twelve-
Mile House, south of h<>re. On thla was a
lagoon with a good water supply, several
wells were sunk and some preliminary
work was done. Rights-of-way for s*v
era! miles were obtained and work com

suits had to be brought for rights-of-way
and these blocked progress. An appeal
made to the citizens of San Jose for
contracts at about one-half the rates of
the Ban Jose Water Company, but few
wore received,
The promoters of the company were all
San Francisco capitalists, headed by E.
H. Wheeler. They became tired of the
enterprise and abandoned it. A mortgage
of Jmi.iKHi had been given to Fisher when
the land was purchased. Neither the
principal nor interest has been paid.
To-day the land and rights-*, f-way of
the company were Fold by Under Sheriff
Yarcoe to satisfy a foreclosure of the
mortgage. The principal, interest and
costs amounted to $10.", 252 25, ana the
property was bought In by Fisher for this
amount.
It is rumored that the West Coast

FRAUDULENT
MINING DEALS
IN ARIZONA
Governor Murphy Issues a
Letter Warning In-
vestors.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PHOENIX, Ariz., June 21.â Governor
X. O. Murphy has issued a circular let
ter warning investors against fraudu
lent copper m. ing companies which
are operating in Arizona. He names
the "Val Verde Copper Company, whose
r-.<- -Tioc: a .-p f or ty miles north of Wil
liams. This company claims to be on
the samÂ« vein as the great United
Verde copper mine, which is 100 miles
south. Of er claims are made which
appear ridiculous when the true condi
tions are known. A mining expert was
sent to examine the claims and he says
the ores* contain no more than 1 per
cent copper and are contained in a sur
face layer of lim stone, copper carbon
ate appearing in this formation In
pockets, with no veins at all appear
ing in the development.
The speculation in copper has opened
a great many good copper mines in
Arizona, and unscrupulous operators
have chosen this territory for their field
of operation. The Spenazuma Mining
Company was exposed by George H.
Smalley, mining editor of the Arizona
Republican of Phoenix, and his report
revealed such a barefaced fraud that
Governor Murphy felt It was his duty
to examine officially Into the operations
of other companies whose claims were
reported of doubtful value.
In his letter warning investors Gov
ernor Murphy named the United Verde
Junior Company, the United Verde Ei
â¢ tension Company and the Spenazuma.
1 The former two companies own claims
near the United Verde mine at. Jerome.
He says that stocks have been sold on

MILITARISM IN IDAHO
Orders of the Secretary of War
Ignored and Prosecution of Labor
Organizations Continues
Special Dispatch to The Call.
The order of Secretary of War
Alger to General Merr/am to permit
subordinate commanders to take
no part in the Coeur d'Alene
troubles other than assist the lo-
cal authorities to preserve the
peace has, apparently, had little
effect upon the military gentlemen
who are overturning the cons/titu
tion in Idaho.
The latest outrage consists in
insults offered by the troopers in
blue to white women, instituting a
reign of such nameless terror as
to make men's blood boil.
WALLACE, Idaho, June 21.â
The prosecution of members
of labor organizations still
continues. Despite the fact
that the Secretary of War
has Issued orders that United States
troops can be used only to suppress
riot the military authorities are doing i
their utmost to drive every sympa
thizer with unionism out of the State. |
The Hunter mine, owned by St. Paul
parties, has been running for several
days with union men. Yesterday the
superintendent was told that if he did
not compel his men to sign the infa
mous permits he would be thrown into
the "bull pen." He defied the military
and declared that he would never ask !
a. man in his employ to sign such a i
document. His incarceration is hourly
expected.
Lieutenant Lyons, who is stationed at j
Burke in command of a company of j
negro soldiers, is especially autocratic.
He not only refuses to allow men to j
seek employment until they secure per
mits, but compels union members of |
the Cooks' Union to prepare meals for
non-union men at the point of the bay
onet. â 
His soldiers are accused of insulting
white women and the community about
Burke is in a state of terror occasioned
by the conduct of his troops. The pro
gramme of the Governor and mine
owners, published nearly a month ago,
is being carried out. \
France, the acting Sheriff and em
ploye of the Bunker Hill Company,
packed the Grand Jury with pronounced
anti-union men. even summoning one
of his own deputies. The indictments
returned by this Grand Jury implicate j
less than one hundred persons, yet over
two hundred men. whose cases were in
vestigated by this fixed Jury and
against whom no indictments were re
turned, are still confined in the bull
pen.
A case of smallpox has developed in
a house not one hundred feet from
where the men are confined, and should
it attack those In the prison the death
rate "would be enormous as there are
no facilities for coping with the disease.
Prisoners in the pen are subjected to
the most inhuman abuse. They are
constantly sworn at and reviled by
thHr negro guards, and the food fur
nished is of a disgusting character. A
diary- kept by one of the prisoners says
that nearly all the moat furnished is
decayed and worm-eaten. The County
Commissioners are still kept in prison,
although no indictments have been
found against them, and Sinclair openly
boasts that he keeps them Imprisoned
simply because he chooses to and has
the power.
The Commissioners are highly re
spected throughout the county and can
prove beyond question that they were
at their homes on the days of the riot.
That the military are being kept here
for the sole purpose of destroying the
miners' unions and intimidating all
persons in sympathy with organized
labor is now not denied, and it is openly
boasted by deputies in the employ of
the mine owners that everything has
been fixed "all the way at present" to
keep the soldiers here as long as the
Governor desires.

COMMISSION ENDS SAMOAN DISPUTE
APIA, Samoa, June 14 (via Auckland, N. Z., June 21). â Mataafa has surrendered 1850 rifles,
and the loyalists have given up 2000. After June 20 a heavy penalty will be enforced upon
natives found with rifles in their possession. Mataafa promised to turn in more weapons.
The natives have returned to their homes.
Malietoa Tanu was recognized as king by the Commissioners of the three powers, and the
decision of Chief Justice Chambers in the matter of the kingship was proclaimed valid and bind
ing. Malietoa Tanu then abdicated in favor of the Commissioners, who appointed a provisional
government, consisting of the Consuls of the three powers, empowering a majority to act in all
cases where unanimity is not required by the Berlin treaty.
Chief Justice Chambers continues to hold office, and the various municipal officials are con
firmed. Dr. Wilhelm Solf has been authorized to act as president of the municipality of Apia. The
Commissioners expect to leave on June 28, but they have requested Chief Justice Chambers to re
main. The report recommends the abolition of kingship and the presidency of Apia and the ap
pointment of a Governor, with a Legislative Council consisting of three nominees of the inter
ested powers, assisted by a native House.
Under this scheme the Governor would have a veto over general and municipal laws; tfie
nominees would be the department heads; consular, diplomatic and judicial functions would be
abolished: revenue would be raised by an increase of duties and poll tax; the jurisdiction of the
Supreme Court would be increased, the municipality, under a Mayor and council, would be ex
tended, and the postoffice would be under the general government.
The British cruiser Porpoise, Captain Sturdee, left, via Fiji, on June 8.
Apia and the country roundabout are resuming normal conditions. Americans and British
express satisfaction at the decision of the Commissione rs.
Among the Germans it is rumored that Dr. Solf will be the administrator in the new native
government.

One of the Philadelphia's crew, at
least, was not glad to reach United
States territory. His name Is John
Burns and he has a sentence of five
years to serve for deliberately trying
to murder Corporal J. E. McDell. Burns
and a number of the cruiser's crew had
been ashore in Apia liaving a pood time
and overstayed their leave. A corporal's
guard was sent out to bring them In
and Corporal McDell arrested Burns.
As the latter was being marched aboard
he toid his captor that he would "do
hyn up" on the first opportunity. As
soon as Burns was released he secured
a Colt's navy revolver from the armory
by some means, and, walking up be
hind McDell, shot him in the side. The
bullet passed through the corporal's
body, close to the surface, narrowly
missed the spine and came out on the
other side. McDell was carried into the
"sick bay" and Burns was placed In
the "brig." When it was found that
McDell would undoubtedly recover
Burns was court-martialed and : :n

lose all his back pay and to be dishon

The Philadelphia will remain in port
a few days, after which she will go to

FIRE AT MENLO PARK.
Hard Work Aione Prevents an Exten
sive Conflagration.
REDWOOD CITY, June 21.-Menlo
Park was visited by fire this morning,
and but for the prompt action of the
volunteer fire department at that place
half of the town would now be in ashes.
Within the last two years three hotels
there have been burned to the ground,
two of which have been rebuilt, and less
than a month ago Hoitt's School was
destroyed.
The fire to-day started in the barn
connected with Martin Kuck's hotel.
The barn was surrounded by other
buildings, and had they taken fire the
whole block would have gone. The de
partment has only one available fire
hydrant, its new ones, six or seven in
number, not yet having been put into
place. Only lately has there been any
fire department at all, Menlo having
been dependent upon Palo Alto and
Redwood City for assistance.
The citizens have now become thor
oughly alarmed. They had recently
purchased 500 feet of fire hose but at
the time of the fire had not taken it
from the railroad freight house. In or
der to use it to-day they were compelled
to break into the freight shed to get it,
the agent not being there at the time
The fire department at Redwood was
telephoned to, but by the time it
reached the scene the fire was under
control. The barn was a total loss.

ADMIRAL SCHLEY IS
READY FOR SEA DUTY
He May Secure the Command of the
South. Atlantic or Pacific
Station.
WASHINGTON, June 21.â Should the
President decide, after consultation
with Secretary Long, not to direct any
investigation of the Sehley controversy,
the suggestion will be advanced to him
that the rear admiral be given duty at
sea. Rear Admiral Sehley stands ready
for sea service, and after his return
from Porto Rico applied for the com
mand of a squadron. His application,
however, was not granted, although the
department in the meantime assigned
Rear Admijal Kautz to command the
Pacific Station and organized a South
Atlantic Station with Rear Admiral
Howison as its commander in chief.
Because of the lack of men-of-war the
European squadron has not been re
formed.
Hear Admiral Howison will retire
from active service on October 10, but
will be detached from his command on
OctODer 0, on -rvlik-n dutP thf. Chicago
will arrive in New York. It is sug
gested that Rear Admiral Sehley be as
signed to duty as his successor. It may
be that Admiral Kautz, when he arrives
at San Francisco, will be willing to re
linquish the command of the Pacific
squadron, in which event this duty will
be given to Sehley.

the parade, in which all the Elks here j
participated. Starting at Twelfth street !
soon after noon the procession moved â¢
east on Washington avenue and thence '
through the business section of the city.
Almost every building had been deco
rated in their honor and on Olive street
at Seventh an elaborate arch spanned j
the roadway. Along the line of march
were thousands of spectators, who
cheered the different lodges as they
marched past.
It took the parade <n\e hour to pass!
a given point and during that timÂ»> n t
a car whf-el was turned In the down- I
town district owing to the congestion I
of traffic and business on the streets
was practically suspended. Each lodge
in line had some distinctive dress, j
either uniform or something unique or I
startling in effect. The St. Louis Lodge, ]
with 400 men In line, dressed in gray
and carrying purple and whit umbrel- i
las, made a fine appearance. Owens
boro <Ky.) i...<i^'> Is'o. 513, the youngest
in the order, attracted attention all
along the line. Culling themselves the

<!'<M"'] to hold the n<^xt meeting at
Milwaukee. The meeting is to be held
on the second Tuesday in July, 1900.
The new constitution also provides
for the abolishment of the Australian
system of voting, and orders that elec
ti"!is be made by roll call. No city
of less than 5000 inhabitant will be
given an Elks' lodge, and in each case
the list of charter members must be
submitted to the next nearest lodge.
No city will be given two lodges. New
Turk now has two. because of its con
solidation with Brooklyn.
In future the grand trustees will be
elected for one. two and three years,
instead of for one year terms as at
present. This will make it necessary to
elect but one trust. â¢â  eaVsh year. The
bond of the grand treasurer was raised
from $10,000 to $25,000, and that of th"
grand secretary from $5000 to $10,000.
These bonds must be furnished by an
Indemnity company, the expense to be
borne by the Grand Lodge. Under the
new constitution no one not a member
of the order can be made an honorary
member of the Elks. This action was
tak' ri because a number of lodges have
in the past made women honorary
members by reason of some favor done.
A new code of procedure for trials
and appeals was submitted and a num
ber of other changes made in the old
laws. The constitution will go into
effect January 1, WOO, if it is ratified
by the lodges not represented at the
present meeting by delegates.
SPRING HAD HIS ARM
AROUND A DAMSEL
Thus Detective Curtin Testifies in
the Divorce Trial at San
Jose.
SAN JOSE, June 21.â Further testi
mony showing the alleged unfaithful
ness of H. M. N. Spring was given to
day in the trial (if the divorce suit
brought by his wife. Detective J. P.
Curtin told of the defendant having had
his arm around a young lady at the
bicycle races in San Francisco several
months ago. and told huw he traced
them to various resorts!
Mrs. Emelie T. Spring followed. Her
testimony related principally to the
property interests of herself and Spring.
Her separate property amounts to
about $11,1)00 and consists of real estate,
mostly in this county. She said Spring
valued his half interest, in the clothing
store at $50,000 and had about $8000
worth of real estate. Half of "his $58,
--000 is alleged to be community prop
erty. There are three childrenâJack
son, .Margaret and Dorothy. Mrs. Spring
testified it would take $275 a month to
support herself and the three children.
Here the plaintiff rested.
Attorney Moore for Spring made and
argued a motion for non-suit, claiming
the evidence was insufficient. The mo
tion was denied by Judge Lorigan. At
torney Moore attacked the evidence of
the detectives, but the court took ex
ception to it and said married women
could not be expected to stand around
on the streets at all hours of the night
and watch recalcitrant husbands, nor
ask friends to perform the vigil, and
the employment of detectives in such
cases was perfectly proper. *
The taking of evidence for the de
fense will commence to-morrow.

LOUBET TRYING TO
GET A CABINET
PARIS, June 21.â M. Bourgeois ar
rived here this morning from The
Hague and conferred with Presi
dent Loubet, M. Brisson and
other political friends. It was
announced late In the day that M.
Bourgeois had declined the task of
forming a Cabiuet. M. del Casse. Min
ister of Foreign Affairs In the Dupuy
Cabinet, will now probably be asked to

After a second interview with M.

Bourgeois consented to remain in Paris
and assist in the negotiation if a new
Ministry is formed. He is strongly
urging M. Waldeck-Rousseau to resume
the task and is actively enlisting sup-
port for him.
In the lobby of the Chamber of Depu
ties to-night it is freely asserted that
M. del Casse will not undertake the re
sponsibility, and as Senator Waldeck-
Rousseau Is not disinclined to another
trial he may possibly be Invited, al

ITS BY-LAWS ACCEPTED AT A
MASS MEETING.
Owners of Orchards in the Vicinity
of Newcastle Declare Their
Readiness to Work for
Co-operation.
Special Dlspat.-h to The Call.
NEWCASTLE, June 21.â Fruit grow
ers met here this evening to form a lo
j cal organization to work in harmony
with the State organization for an inde- !
pendent car line. C. H. Kellogg was
I selected to act as temporary chairman
and G. L. Threlkel as secretary. Mr.
Threlkel addressed the growers and !
read the by-laws, articles of incorpora
tion and the growers' contract. The
latter provides that in consideration of
$1 paid by the local organization the j
grower signing agrees to turn over to j
the association 7 per cent, plus 1 cent
! per box, for loading, for which the as- ;
; sociation agrees to market the fruit in
the best possible manner and at the !
I best possible prices. Mr. Threlkel said: ,
Could we obtain forty gTOwers' signa
tures we would then be strong: enough
to commence operations and i-mild guar
antee 120 carloads and could at least be
ready for business early in 1900 ana posai ..
blj this season. Placer must l^ad in this
movement and Placer crmwers ure going
to Bee the movement through at any ex
pense. Although I believe a car line is
not our only relief, as we have fruit
hanging- on the tree? and it must be mar
keted, yet we should have an Independ
ent car line. If we can make the proper
showing we < an obtain concessions, and
if the State association can make a re
duction of Bit per cent in the refrigerator
charges, as claimed, the growers certain
ly cutfht to be able to do business on
those terms.
G. Geraldson said he did not favor
immediate action, as that would neces
sitate doing a commission business, and
he was in favor of an f. o. b. business,
as was the State organization.
"The consignment business is bad
policy," he said, "and as for me, I
would rather feed my fruit to the hogs
than to encourage It."
Charles Carlson favored Immediate
action. After considerable discussion
the by-laws and articles of incorpora
tion were accepted.
"Remember, gentlemen," said Mr.
Threlkel, "we are to work in perfect
harmony with the State organization,
and it should be perfectly understood
by all."
Nm decisive steps for Immediate ac
ti"ii were taken, as it is apparently de
si red to keep the question before the
growers in order to obtain united ac
tion. A majority of the growers favor
the movement and may be expected to
lend their hearty support.

WICHITA, Kan., June 21.â W. H.
Hill, alias Alexander Jester, charged
with the murder of William Gates, near
<â  Paris, Mo., May 2, 1871, arrived here to
night in charge of officers and was
placed in the County Jail. He was de
nounced by his sister, Mrs. Cornelia
â  Street of Shawnee, O. T., who said she
I was engaged to Gates when her broth
er murdered him. William Gates was
the brother of John W. Gates of Chi- (
cage, president of the American Steel
I and Wire Company, and a candidate
for the United States Senate to succeed
Cullom. Mrs. Street said to-night:
"As 1 stand here and look at my
brother behind the cell doors it Is the
( happiest moment in my whole life. He i
i has ruined my life by slaying my lover,
. and 1 have traveled everywhere and
spent a fortune in having him run to
earth. Why, he even sent a man to
me who persuaded me Lo marry him
under pretense he was my brother's
friendâ that was Streetâ and when I
found he was false I quit him. Only
when my brother is led to the.gallosvs
will 1 feel my duty done."
According to Mrs. Street's story her
family and that of William Gates lived
In Alton, 111., thirty years ago. Cornelia
; Jester and William Gates were loveis
and engaged to be married. Her brother
: learned of their engagement by over
-1 hearing a conversation while they were
; out walking one night. Mrs. Street as
serts ber brother then resolved to mur
der dates in order to prevent their mar
riage. Alexander Jester and William
Gates left Alton on a trip into Mis
! souri.
Gates was killed near Paris, Mo., and
his body burned in a brush pile. Mrs.
Street declares her brother was the
murderer. She Bays Jester was ar
rested at Valley Center, taken to Paris,
tried and convicted, but escaped by
sawing out of jail. He then changed
his name and fled, according to his
sister, who says she has since been in
pursuit of him.
Last S.-.ttirday night Sheriff Sim
] mons 7-eceived a letter from Mrs. Street
stating her brother was the real mur
derer of William Gates and she de-
I sired him arrested, -he Sheriff at once
| sent men to Shawnee and arrested
i Jester. He was held there awaiting or
! ders until to-d .y. Jester is alleged to
have confessed he is the man wanted.
Jester is now 80 years old and is known
to have led a respectable life for the
last twenty years. He is quite wealthy
and his arrest was kept quiet at Shaw
nee.
People of Shawnee believe Mrs.
Street Is lying about the affair and say
the /Whole scheme is to get revenge
on her brother on account of disagree
ments on various matters. The officers
here believe Mrs. Street's story is true
and say parts of it are substantiated
by the official records.
TRUSTS ARE UNLAWFUL
UNDER IOWA'S LAWS
Attorney General Rsmley's Interest-
ing Address at a Convention
of County Attorneys.
DES MOINES, la., June 21.âAttor
ney General Remley, in an address to
day to the county attorneys of the
State, in convention here, declared that
trusts are unlawful under the lowa
laws. Ho advised county attorneys to
use their efforts to suppress trusts in
the State. Among other things the At
torney General said:
"There is no question that combina
tions entered into by large aggregations
of capital to increase prices or decrease
production of manufactures and mer
chandise of any kind which administer
to the necessities or comforts of men
are an evil, and nothing but an evil.
There is one criminal law to which I
wish to call your attention. It has been
in force for a number of years, and I
believe there has never been a crimi
nal prosecution under it. Section 5067
provides, among other things. 'It shali
be the duty of the Grand Jury to in
quire into and ascertain if there exists
any pool, trust or combination within
their respective counties.' The same
section says: "County attorneys, in
their counties, and the Attorney Gen
eral, shall enforce the provisions of a
public nature in the seven preceding
sections.' County attorneys and grimd
juries must take the initiative in this
matter. As legal advisers of the Grand
Jury you can do much to bring to jus
tice any violators of the anti-trust laws.
You can do your State no better service
than by either demonstrating the non
existence of unlawful pr-ols and trusts
in the State or by bringing the guilty
parties to justice. I pledge you here
and now that your efforts will be sec
onded by the Attorney General's office
and any assistance which I can give
will he most heartily given."

Spei ia! Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA BARBARA. June 21.â The
jury in the case of Yda Addis Storke,
charged with criminal libel, returned a
verdict of guilty this evening, after
having deliberated five and a half
hours.
Senator Boyce finished his closing ar
gument at 12:15 o'clock. The District j
Attorney then spoke, and the jury re
tired at 4 o'clock. The defendant left i
the court room, which was filled with
visitors, all anxious to hear the verdict
of the jury. At 9:20 p. m. the defend- j
ant returned. At 9:28 the jury, fol- j
lowed by an immense throng of specta- i
tors, entered the courtroom. It is said i
the jury reached an agreement early,
but held back the announcement be- >
cause it did not want to report before j
the crowd that remained in the court
room in the early hours of the evening,
wishing to spare the accused woman
as much as possible. Finally the Coun
ty Clerk read the verdict:
"We, the jury, find the defendant
guilty."
The defendant was given until 10
o'clock to appear for sentence or make
a motion fur a new trial.
Mrs. Storke was indicted by the
Grand Jury in December last on a
charge of sending libelous letters to
Dr. S. A. Winchester. The twon had
been flooded with the anonymous let
ters making charges of the vilest na
ture against Dr. Winchester and Dr.
Martha <'ase, a young woman practic
ing here. Scores of letters were re
ceived in May. June and July, IS9B, and
the postal authorities took the matter
up. A detective traced the authorship
of the letters to Mrs. Storke, but. fear
ing the case could not be made in the
Federal Court, the matter was laid be
fore the Grand Jury.
Th" defense tried, to connect a num
ber of prominent persons here, includ
ing the divorced husband of Mrs.
Storke, with the authorship of the let
ters, claiming there was a conspiracy to
drive her from the city by connecting
her name with the letters. The trial
has occupied the Superior Court, Judge
( Â»ster of San Bernardino presiding, for
three arid a half weeks. Great interest
was taken in the trial, the court room
being crowded at all times.
Y<la Addis Storke was once well
known in Southern California news
paper circles and was considered a
brilliant writer.
Since tho cnmmoneoment of the libel
suit the wife of Dr. Winchester, th>
complaining witness, has instituted
proceedings for a divorce.

| NEWPORT, June 21.â Several promi

The passengers exchanged saluta

AFTER THE BURBANK
LOS ANGELES, June 21.â Notwlth- \
standing the statements of Walter M<>
rosco, it is authoritatively announced
that the San Francisco manager has
not secured the Burhank Theater. Mo- j
rosco's failure is said to arise from a
desire to date the lease from September
L John Griffin, the owner, who de
mands rent for July and August, sent
Morosco an ultimatum to-day that he
must comply with the terms by noon
to-morow or the deal will bo void.
Harry Wyatt, who is in San Francisco,
wired for terms. The Walthers want it;
so do L. Behymer and Walter Mears.
Morosco telegraphed to Griffin to-night
that he bad mailed his statement and
asked him to hold every one off until
it is received.

CALL HEADQUARTERS, WEL
LINGTON HOTEL, WASHINGTON.
June 21.â Surgeon General Sternberg is
â¢ absent from Washington, but I leaxn
j that he received communications from
i South America showing that the Sana
! relli serum was not producing as favor
| able results in yellow fever cases as its
: discoverer has announced.
Surgeon General Wyman of the Ma
rine Hospital service to-day received a
telegram from Dr. Park, the quarantine
; officer at Santiago, reporting the exist fe
| ence at that port of fourteen cases oi?
I yellow fever and four deaths from that
' cause. This is not the first report the
Marine Hospital service has received,
of the existence of the scourge at San-
I tiago.
Five days ago five cases were re
ported. There has not been time for a
' mail report since the outbreak. In ad-
I dition to the number of cases and
deaths Dr. Park's cablegram to-day
conveyed the information that the
American troops had evacuated the
barracks and their bedding and bag
gage were being disinfected aboard the
hospital boat Rough Rider, which is fit
ted with a complete disinfecting plant.
The fact that the season has advanced
thus far with the appearance only of
a few sporadic cases of the yellow fever
; led to the general hope that the im
proved sanitary condition of Santiago,
: Havana and other Cuban cities since
i the American occupation might result
in preventing an outbreak.
The following bulletin was posted at
the War Department:

Numerous Marriage Licenses Issued

SAN RAFAKL, June 21. -The County
Clerk's office did a rushing business to
daj in the Issuance of marriage licenses.
One of the applicants from San Francisco
seemed very eager that tho news of his

;by justice Rodden was formerly Miss
Flattie M. Eaton of SB3 Shi-ndor street.
Hi r father is Arthur J. Eaton, proprii tor

Harry J. Rich, formerly employed as
clerk by the George 11. Tay Company, but
now in the Engineer Corpa at Fort Point.
procured a license to wed Miss Rose Fitz

former sweetheart named Minnie McCar
thy, employed by Lev] Strauss & Co.,
i and Miss Fitzsimmons with William
I Ryan, who works .it the corner of Hyde

Special Dliipatcb to The Call.
LOUISVILLE, June 21. The
cause of free silver in the State
of Kentucky got a jolt in the
Democratic Convention to-day
;ts advocates will remember for
long time. The leading candidate
for the Governorship, General
P. "Wat Hardin, a pronounc< d lÂ»i
--metallist, failed to organize the
convention, which feat was ac
complished after a desperate
struggle by the combined forces
â¢>f ex-Congressman W. .1. Stone
and Siat- Si nator William Goe
bel, als<> aspirants for the Gub
natorial nomination, who have
been openlj charged with being
g'Â»ld standard men. Hardin has
lassed as one of the orig
inal ad tes "l" white metal,
but everything now points to
his defeal notwithstanding, as
the gold forces have seated all
the < ontested
districts, and the present indica
cations are that the committee
solutions to be named to
morrow will he so constituted
thru no mention of white metal
will be mad" in the platform pre
sented. When adjournment was
taken at midnicht there were
threats of a bolt by the silver
men.
LOUISVILLE, Ky.. June 21.â The first
law of heaven had little to do with the
regulation of to-day's proceedings of
the Democratic State convention. On
the contrary order gave place to great
confusion, and after sweltering through
nearly eight hours of tedious hearing
of contests the convention, without
nominating a chairman, adjourned un
til evening in a whirlwind of chairs,
fans, tally sheets and reporters' copy.
Fortunately no one was hurt.
This finale was as unexpected as it
was lively. The sweltering, packed-in,
jammed-together mass of delegates,
politicians and onloc-kers had yelled it
self hoarse, fanned itself pallid. It was
more in a humor to do Justice to a din
ner than a prize-fight.
Feeling was at high tension over an j
argument that was in progress before j
Chairman Johnston over the contested j
ration from Kenton County, the i
home of William Goebel, one of the j
leading candidates for Governor. Con
gressman Ellis of the Sixth District, a
venerable gentleman of much vehe- i
inence. was eloquently presenting the
Ooebel side of the case, and was being
interrupted at short intervals by noisy
I demonstrations of approval. As much
<>f this interference came from the
stage, which was crowded with candi- I
dates, guests, officers of the convention \
and newspaper men, Chairman John- I
ston announced that the platform would
bo cleared at the next interruption. A
-00-pound ruralite, a little the worse for '
his political and spirituous excitement, |
mounted a chair and challenged Major
Johnston to carry out his threat, an
nouncing incidentally that force would
be necessary in his case. Quick"" as a
flash Jim Williams started from the
front of the stage for the intruder in a
businesslike way. Williams is a jovial
character of some repute in gunnery, j
and his activity was the signal for a '
stampede toward the exits. Almost â¢
everybody was standing on a chair j
when the affair occurred, and the re
suit was a general scramble to get out !
of the way of a general disarrange
ment of furniture. Half a dozen men
surrounded each of the belligerents and
the disturber was hustled out. Not i
however, until the crowd had cleared a |
space in the middle of the stage about !
thirty feet in diameter, having a fringe |
of huddled humanity around the edge, !
crouched in corners or behind shelter- I
ing walls. As no weapon was drawn I
this struck the humor of the crowd and !
quiet was restored, but meanwhile
Chairman Johnston had declared the
convention adjourned until evening
Aside from this incident the day's
session was a dull monotony, varied ;
only by an occasional heated discussion
between heads of rival delegations or
an outburst of applause as one or an
other condidate scored an advantage in '
the roll call for: temporary chairman i
For this position the Stone-Goebel I
combination nominated Judge David B. I
Red wine of Breathett County, while
the Hardin men named Hon. W. H
Sweeney of Marion County. When the
roll had been called once Redwine had
r.4o'Â£ of the votes and Sweeney 428 1 / Â£,
but 150 votes had been passed; on ac
count of contests. These were taken
up by counties, and Chairman Johnston
of the State Central Committee heard
arguments by both sides before recog
nizing a contested delegation. This
consumed the entire day's session and
caused changes which left the vote at
adjournment as follows: Redwine,
569%; Sweeney, 528^.
When the convention got together
this evening Chairman Johnston took
the Kenton County contest under ad
visement, after which he decided in
favor of the regular delegates in two
districts and threw out the third.
Johnston then announced the result of
the ballot for temporary chairman, de
claring Redwine elected by a vote of I
551 5-6 to 529 1-6 for Sweeney. This I
marked the success of the first step In
the Stone-Ooebel combination. The an
nouncement was received with tumult
uous applause. Judge Redwine made a
brief speech of thanks to the conven- i
tion and assumed the chair. After em
powering the chairman to appoint com
mittee members of the State at large
the convention adjourned until to
morrow morning.

MILES NOT SENT
TO PHILIPPINES
PRESIDENT
SATISFIED
WITH OTIS
Insurgent Army Takes to
the Hills and Swamps
Beyond Imus.
Sppoial Dispatch to The Call.
CALL HE ADQUARTERS,
WELLING TON HOTEL.
WASHINGTON, June 21.â
It is authoritatively denied that the
President has any intention of send
ing Major General Miles to the Phil
ippines. Major General Otis is con
ducting the campaign satisfactorily,
and the President does not propose
to reflect upon him by dispatching
his senior to relieve him. General
Miles told me to-day tnat he had not
applied for service in Manila, and
he had heard nothing from the Presi
dent to lead him to suppose that that
official proposed to give him orders to
proceed to that point.
MANILA, June 21, 3:21 p. in.â The in
surgent army has taken to the swamps
and hills beyond Imus. The largest
force is supposed to he in the neigh
borhood of San Francisco de la Mala
bon, holding a posrtion more toward
the lake or toward the coast, acnrd
ing as exigencies demand.
General "Wheaton returned to Imus
to-day, bringing three men who were
wounded in yesterday's fighting.
The heavy rains that fall nightly
make campaigning uncomfortable. The
roads are still good, but the rice fields
adjoining them are pools of water.
The Filipinos will not fight unless
they can meet our troops in positions
most advantageous to themselves or
take our reeÂ«>nnoitering bodies in am
bush.
It is impossible to learn what effect
the recent defeat has had upon their
leaders. This should be disheartening,
for they had boasted that the Amer
icans could never conquer the province
of Cavlte, Aguinaldo's home county,
where he always worsted the Span
iards.
General Otis recently received a let
ter signed by native women of the
province declaring that if all the men
were killed the women would still keep
up the fight against the Americans.
Copies of the insurgent organ, Inde
pendencia. show that the Filipinos'
hopes nf success are kept aflame by po
litical movements in America.
The Independencia prints reports of
alleged speeches made at alleged meet
ings in the United States denouncing
the war, and it a-sserts that these repre
sent the dominant American sentiment.
It declares also that the FllipinÂ«rs will
"ntinue the war until the next Presi
dential campaign, which is "sure to re
sult in a decision to withdraw the
American troops from the Philippines."
It is reported that the Spanish garri
son at Baler, in the province of Prin
cipe, on the east coast of Luzon, which
had become reduced to thirty-three
m^n, finally surrendered to the Fili
pinos after holding out for a year. The
Filipinos imprisoned two Englishmen at
Tachbobona. on the Island of Samar.
southeast of Luzon. The British first
class cruiser Grafton steamed to the
point from Cebu and their commander
demanded their release. When this was
refused he landed a force of marines
and cleared his ship for action, where
upon the Englishmen were handed over.

ACQUISITION OF SPANISH
ISLANDS BY GERMANY
BERLIN. June 21.â 1n the Reichstag
to-day, during the discussion of the sup
plementary credits for the protectorates
and the loan therefor, the Minister of
Foreign Affairs. Baron yon Bulow, again
defended the acquisition of the Spanish
islands, which, he said, the Government
i had long entertained, as iuwould tend to
the development of Germany's old pos
sessions. He added that he was no
builder of castles in the air, but had pro
ceeded quietly, soberly and advisedly, as

possessions would prove most valuable,

SENATOR BATE NOT
FOR IMPERIALISM
SENATOR W. B. BATE OF TENNESSEE.
FRESNO, June 21.â United States Senator W. B. Bate of Tennessee, who
has been visiting relatives in this city for the past week or so, left
last night for Los Angeles to visit his daughter, Mrs. Childs, and his
Bister, Mrs. Tyree of that city. In an interview before leaving Senator
Bate expressed his views on public topics quite plainly.
"I opposed Hawaiian annexation," said the Senator, "because it was in
violation of the principles of the Monroe doctrine, and because it represents
a violation of the spirit and genius of our Government; moreover, because
we want no such representatives as the races of Hawaii and the Philippine
Islands would send us. I am equally oppcrsed to the colonial system."
Senator Bate said this system would cause us to follow in the footsteps of
monarchies. It would lead us in the path that led republican Rome to de
struction. Colonization means centralization; centralization means imper
ialism and a large standing army. This last is one of the evil consequences
to be dreaded from the present war in the Philippines.
"The fact that I was elected without opposition," continued the Senator,
"indicates that the people of Tennessee are in harmony with this view.
The people of the South are opposed to expansion. On this coast, and espe
cially in San Francisco. I have found the expansion principle largely fa
vored and advocated by the wealthy classes and wholesale merchants, and
by those who are commonly known as goldbugs."
Bate said a very small part of the Populists will refrain from co-operat
ing with the Democracy, especially if Mr. Bryan Is the leader. Another
thing which is encouraging is that a large portion of the German element In
the Northwestern States, which are doubtful, is in sympathy with the De
mocracy and against expansion.
America and Germany. From the out-
Bet the Minister also said, Germany
could dispense with the costly military
establishments of Spain. During the
course of his remarks Baron yon Rulow
said: ''We hold it to be our first duty to
see that our relations with other powers
are undisturbed by the new acquisition,
and hope that our relations with the im
mediate neighbors of the islands, name
ly, the Americans and Japanese, will only
become more intimate. We have not
thought of placing ourselves in opposi
tion to the Americans in the South Pa
cific, and we as little wish to prejudice
American interest? as America contem
plates injuring us without cause or rea
son." , ,
The Reichstag: subsequently passed the
second reading of the credit for the pur
chase of the islands, with the loan bill
and the commercial convention with
Spain attached.
BARON DU MARAIS
MURDERED BY FILIPINOS
MADRID. June 21.â A dispatch to the
Imparcial from Manila says Baron dv
Marais, a Frenchman, who Avent to the
rebel camp to Intervene in behalf of
the Spanish prisoners in the hands of
the Filipinos, has been treacherously
murdered.
The first report of the murder of
Baron dv Marais was received in New j
York from Manila under dates of May |
11 and May 16. It was announced that
T. B. dv Marais of Philadelphia, a
brother of Baron dv Marais, was seek
ing information concerning the fate of
the Baron. Adjutant General Corbln
telegraphed to Major General Otis, who
replied as follows: "A committee of ;
citizens sent Citizen dv Marais to the j
insurgent authorities to intercede for j
the release of the Spanish prisoners.
The last information regarding him was '
that he was with Luna's forces at Cal
umpit, before the town was captured.
It is the belief of many citizens here
that Dv Marais was murdered. Others j
believe that he is held a prisoner."
INGERSOLL TALKS
AS AN EXPANSIONIST
PHILADELPHIA, June 21.â Colonel
Robert G. Ingersoll, in response to a re
quest for his views on the Philippine
question, said to-night:
"I am an expansionist. This country
has land hunger and expansion is popu
lar. J want all we can honestly set. But
I do not want the Philippines unless the
Filipinos want us. and I feel exactly the
same about the Cubans. We must act
nobly to the Filipinos, whether we got
the "islands or not. I would like to bee
peace between us and the Filipinosâ peace
honorable to both; peace based on reason
Instead of force."

Mary Wanted to Die.
Mary Casnero, a Mexican girl, nineteen
years of age, who lives on Hinckley alley,
attempted suicide last night by swallow
ing a dose of precipitate of mercury. She
was taken to the Harbor Receiving Hos
pital, where she was treated by Dr. yon
der Lelth. She recovered sufficiently In
a short time to be able to go home. She
says that she had no money and preferred
suicide to death by starvation.
Fireman Jumps Overboard.
Harry Lane, a man about 45 years .of
age, who shipped on the tug Rescue as a j
fireman on her recent trip to Coos Bay,
jumped overboard on the trip. His body
was recovered by the sailors and brought
to this city, arriving last night, and was
taken to ihe Morgue.
DENTISTS ACCOMPLISH
GREAT DEAL OF WORK
INTERESTING DEMONSTRATIONS
MADE IN CLINICS.
At the Night Session Several In
structive Papers Were Read and
Discussed at Length.
Much work was accomplished yesterday
at the second day's session of the twenty
eighth annual convention of the California
Dental Association. The morning' session
was devoted to routine business and the
appointment of several important com
mittees, among which was a committee
to examine into the matter of having
dentists appointed to the army and navy.
The matter of appointing delegates to the
national convention of the association was
left to the president. The following appli
cants for membership in the association,
having been approved by the board of
trustees, were elected: "W. R. Linscott,
A. J. Hineker. G. W. Earl, G. H. Kreich
baum, J. Moran Pearce. W. A. Atwood
C R. "Wilcoxon. T. A. Vogel and C. S.
Zelgler. A paper on "Dental Education"
w;ts read by I'r. W. A. Knowles, and one
on "The Choice of Proper Filling Ma
terials" by Dr. J. Foster Flagg. Both
papers were discussed at some length by
the dentists.
The afternoon session was devoted en
tirely to the clinics and proved to be ex
tremely interesting. Dr. S. L. Strickland
of San Francisco demonstrated cataphor-
Fsis and rool canal filling: Dr. G. E. Stall
man of San Francisco demonstrated metal
posts for abutments in crown and bridge
work; Dr. A. M. Barker of San Jose dem
onstrated insertion of disto-ocolusal gold
lining without matrix, using Perry sepa
rator: T)r. A. F. Merrlam of wakland
demonstrated the use of the napkin In the
mouth in gold filling; Dr. E. R. Tait of
' Oakland showed the use of creosoted
charcoal points in alveolar abscess "with
treatment; Dr. A. C. Hart of San Fran
cisco showed treatment for the prevention
of decay in the teeth and ajso the making
of an. antiseptic mouth wash; Dr. Rus
sell Hopkins of San Francisco showed the
process of implantation and the use of
silk ligatures in orthodontla, and Dr C
Deiehmiller of San Francisco gave a dem
onstration of combination gold and ce
ment filling and the administration of
chloroform by means of an inhaler admit
ting atmospheric air.
The night session was prefaced by a
general discussion of the afternoon work
in clinics. This proved to be very inter
esting and gratifying to the members of
the association. The following and ex
haustive papers were then read and dis

Delegates at the Conference Yet Hope

Special Cable to The Call and the New York

don Bennett.
BERLIN. June 21.â Mr. Holls
has been to Berlin, and yester
day managed to see both the
Chancellor and Minister of For
eign Affairs. Not obtaining any
satisfaction, he started off to
find the Kaiser, who to-morrow
arrives at Kiel.
THE HAGUE, June 21.â The best in
formed circles here do not share the
gloomy views of the European press
regarding the peace conference. After
a week's adjournment, the arbitration
committee met for a short time to-day.
Dr. Zorn of the German delegation and
Frederick Holls of the American dele
gation attended. Mr. Holls expressed
himself as satisfied with the results of
the trip he took to Berlin in company
with Dr. Zorn, and the German dele
gates have been instructed to take part
in the deliberations of the arbitration
committee which will now continue
brisk work pending the final decision of
Germany.
The disarmament committee, to
whom was submitted the circular of
Count Muravieff, has considered the
second, third and fourth paragraphs
in .sub-committee, the result being a
negative vote upon all three, on the
ground that it would be impossible to
decide upon a satisfactory plan for
checking the continued improvements
in explosive ordnance. This decision
wlli be submitted to the committee to
morrow. The first paragraph of the
circular, which proposes to arrest the
increase of land and sea forces and war
budgets, has not yet been touched.
The Russians, its is said, intend to in
troduce fresh proposals, and it is not
doubted that the conference will reach
important proposals on the last four
paragraphs of the circular supplement
ing the Geneva convention and the
Brussels conference, and providing for
mediation and arbitration.

Grand Grove Will To-Day Name the
Men Who Shall Conduct Its
Affairs for the Ensuing
Term.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PLACERVILLE, Cal., June 21.â The
Grand Grove of the United Ancient
Order of Druids devoted its forenoon
session to business. Two brothers re
ceived the grand arch degree. A reso
lution making an appropriation for the
support of the Druids' Magazine was
adopted. ..e decisions of the noble
grand arch in the appeals of Mazzini
Grove and B. Pellegini, involving pro
cedure in the trials of brothers before
the subordinate groves, were upheld by
the Grand C .ye upon the recommen
dation of the committee on appeals and
grievances.
The proposition to change the right
of representation from one represen
tative for every twenty-five members
to one representative for every fifty
members provoked the most important
discussion of the session. Numerous
representatives took part, among whom
were Past Noble Grand Arch Goller, in
favor of the proposition, and Past No
ble Grand Arch Devoto against the
change. The proposition was almost
unanimously voted down.
The election of grand officers will
take place to-morrow. The contest for
deputy grand arch is assuming inter
esting proportions. Six candidates are
in the field and it is difficult to predict
who will be the successful one. Hagen,
Lange, Godeau, Schord and O'Donneil
are the leading candidates.
At the afternoon session of the Grand
Grove reports of committees were re
ceived and adopted.
At 4 o'clock p. m. the Grand Grove
adjourned and in a body proceeded to
Union Cemetery, where it held me
morial services at the grave of the late
Frederick Sieg, P. G. N. A., the founder
of Druidism on the Pacific Coast. The
grave was decorated with many beauti
ful floral pieces and wreaths of oak and
mistletoe, and eloquent addresses on
the life and character of Mr. Sieg were
delivered by Past Noble Grand Arch
Devoto and District Deputy Grand
Arch Mayer of this city.
To-night the visitors were entertained
with an open-air concert, a ball at the
opera-house and a banquet at Confi
dence Hall.
FET KEE'S FACTORY
SEIZED FOR FRAUD
CHINESE PUNKS SOLD FOR IM-
PORTED WEEDS.
Internal Revenue Department De
frauded by the Use of Refilled
Cigar Boxes and Uncan
celed Stamps.
Burt M. Thomas, special agent of in
ternal revenue, conferred a favor upon
cig-ar smokers yesterday by seizing the
cigar factory of the Capitol Cigar Com- j
pany at 649 Clay street and placing its
proprietor, Fet Kee. alias Choo Yee. un
der arrest for refilling cigar boxes with
cigars and for placing cigars in old boxes
on which the revenue stamps had not |
been destroyed and for using an imitation
imported label.
Several weeks ago Agent Thomas dis
covered that Chinese-made cigars were
being sold under popular brands of Key
West and Havana firms. These inferior
cigars were sold at $40 per thousand, while
the genuine article which they were re- j
placing were selling at from $S0 to $90 per
thousand.
Mr. Thomas traced the counterfeit j
weeds to a white retail dealer, whose i
name he declines to make public. This
dealer had been in the habit of bringing
the empty cigar boxes to the factory and
having them tilled with the Chinese-made
article. By leaving the old revenue
stamps on the boxes he was enabled to
save the tax, which amounts to $3 <>0 per
thousand. Fet Yee. being in the business
of making and selling cigars, filled the
boxes without question and took his
money with thanks.
The white man was given four of the
empty boxes found in his possession after
they had been privately marked with the
initials of the revenue officials and were !
sent to the factory. Fet Kee filled them
with 4-cent cigars, but the white man had
but money sufficient to pay for two boxes,
which he took away, leaving the other
two in the factory to be called for. They
were called for about an hour afterward
by Mr. Thomas and posse and were found
In the factory neatly filled.
The factory, containing 200.000 cigars, !
besides h large quantity of tobacco, was
seized. The value of the plant and stock
is about $10,000. The penalty for Fet Kee's
offense is the confiscation of the* entire
plant and stock and imprisonment for six
months to two years, with a fine added.
Such cases are usually compromised on
payment of a money penalty.
MRS. PARRY ARRAIGNED.
She Secures Her Release on New
Bonds Which Are Considered
Satisfactory.
Mrs. May Parry was arraigned in Judgo
Graham's court yesterday morning on the
charge of manslaughter )n causing the |
death of her husband. She was heavily
veiled and was accompanied by her
mother, Mrs. Van Valkenburg, and her
attorney. George A. Knight. The court
room was crowded.
She was instructed as to her rights by
the Judge and arraigned, and by consent
the preliminary examination was con
tinued till June 2S. This concluded the
proceedings.

the defendant on a new bond, the sure
ties being Attorney Knight and the de
fendant's mother, who gave further de
tails as to her property in Woodland on

Murder Mystery at Da-
mons Point.
Special nispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, June 21.â Daniel Duwney,
whose residence is on Damons Point,
is in jail at Ab rdeen on a charge of
having murdered his partner, Joseph
rson. According to Downey, An
n started two weeks ago in Dow
ney's boat to sual ten boxes of Quinalt
salmon at the Oychut dock, and never
returned. The boat was found. Last
week Downey was arrested and tried
stealing the fish, liut for want of
evidence was discharged. He then de
clared Anderson had been drowned
while stealing the lish, and that he had
advised Anderson 1 1 â¢â¢ t to pt^al them.
On Saturday Undertaker Beardslee
and Coroner Bush of Westport were
notified that. Anderson's body had been
: The former went to Da
- Point, at the mouth of the har
bor, and after a long search discovered
the body under a log, and covered, as if
It had been buried with mud ami sand.
It was Impossible for the body t>. have
got there, thus covered, without human
agency. The body was brought to
Aberdeen and examined by Che Coro
nter and others. It was found that the
throat >if th>- unfortunate man had
!>â¢ en cut from ear to ear ami the skull
i. rushed.
The theory is thai the partners had
n the lish together and quarreled
ovei the division, the dispute ending in
Downey striking Anderson on the
. and then cutting his throat. The
was then disposed ot under the
ii a place Beldom visited by any
â  i c.
It is learned that Downey an 1 Ander
son were Inclined to quarrel with each
other at times, and it i? reported
th.it â¢ !.Â»â  quarrel went bo far that Dow
threatened to silence Anderson for
dII time. The evidence against Downey
is purely circumstantial, but his impli
\ed to be the only f"lu
t:'in i f ih.- mystery surrounding Ander
son's death. Even then it set-ins im
pn bable thai they would have quar
. cvei a division of th" Btolen ten

to-morrow. IlÂ» Is supposed to be going
under an assumed name, having got
Into a shooting scrape in Oregon. He
has been known as a rough character,
while Anderson always was regarded aa
a law-abiding and peaceful man.

GREAT BRITAIN
AND VENEZUELA
Argument Before Boun-
dary Commission.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, June 21. â The Venezuelan bound
ary commission reassembled at 11 o'clock
this morning, and Sir Richard Webster, I
the British Attorney General, resumed his
speech In behalf of the case of Great Brit
ain. Dealing with the period from WOO to
1637, he said Great Britain was unable to 1
rely on the Spanish records of Venezuelan
control and was compelled to fall back
upon the discovery and circumnavigation,
so called, of the unit of Guiana. Venezuela
arguing that Guiana was a defined area,
that Spain had discovered that defined
area and had taken part, In the name of
the svholi -taking such possession as to J
tntitle them to the whole.
In close detail Sir Richard Webster ex
amined th< work of the various explorers
of the period upon whom Venezuela relied,
claiming that they were not relevant to
the territory of Guiana, adding that the I
statements made before the United States
commission must not be argued against
Great Britain, as frequent deductions were
made which were totally unsupported, as
Justice Brewer, a former memoer of .hut
commission, would doubtless member.
According 10 counsel for Great Britain the
first explorer who really reached viuiana I
was De Berrio, and his expedition was in- 1
tended Sir Richard added, to apply to a
different Dart vi the country ana for a.
different object than that alleged by Ven
ezuela, who fcught to apply it to a small i
district.
Counsel protested against it i><?ine j
pieced on so as to establish this "so called :
Spanish title." He further asserted that 1
"it had failed miserably, as both tne j
Dutch and the Spanish historians agreed j
that then- was one Spanish settlement on 1
the Orinoco before 1720."
As to the Spanish coasting voyages. Sir '
Richard Webster said the Spaniards occa- |
sionally traded, but the Dutch traded and <
Settled. By the truce of 1009 the Dutch j
Bltion was known and acknowledged by :
pain, and, as Motley, the hostorian, had
stated, "t*;e orange flag of the republic
was to ill ..Â« over all America, from Man
hattan Island to the shores of Brazil and
the Straits of Magellan, provided I'hi'Jp
had not had ships and soldiers to vinul
cate with the sword that sovereignty
wrlrh Spanish words and genius bad
once acquired."
Continuing, the British counsel claimed
that discover}', when not followed by oc
cupation, v.as of no value as the basis of
title; Inasmuch as nations had never con
rented to the contrary doctrine. Discov
ery, if accompanied by a certified or noto
rious Intention to acquire, gave a prior op
portunity of acquiring, which opportunity
it would be a violation of the comity of
nations to Interfere with prematurely.
The occupation of vacant Darts of the
world treated as not in the possession cf
a distant owner was a case of transfer of
possession, for there were no parties be
tween whom such a convention could
push. Guiana was vacant. The Dutcn tet
tled and controlled It. while the Spaniards
held one miserable spot on the Orinoco,
which could not control the huge district
lying between the Orinoco and the Essl
duibo. Sir Richard Webster then detailed
the exploits of the Dutch In conjunction
with Sir Walter Raleigh, bringing hi- ar
guments un to the events of 1<537.

ATLANTIC CITY, N. J., June 21.â At

ficers to be elected for tho ensuing year:
President, Charles E. Walton, Cincinnati;

P. Youngman, Atlantic City; registrar,
H. C. Aldrich, Minneapolis. The election
will take place to-morrow.
The Hoard of Censors reported favorably the
names of 110 applicants for membership, and
they were all unanimously elected.
l)r. J. G. B. Custlg of Washington presented
a resolution, the adoption of which was urged
by the Homeopathic Medical *â  dety of that
city. Tho resolution charged the medical de
partment of th<- army with "inefficiency to
i meet the hygienic, sanitary and medical neces
sities' that are Incident to war." and with
ignoring the personal service and hospital con
ditions umler homeopathic control. It was urged
that st*-ps be taken tr. secure recognition tor
Kiiidnates of tho school of homeopathy in the
enactment of any laws and that all appoint
ments to the medical corps of the army and
navy and marine hospital service be after com
petitive examinations.
! The establishment In Washington by the Gov
| ernment of a bureau to investigate the treat
ment of diseases peculiar to the United States
was approved.
Dr. J. C Wood of Cleveland delivered n
special address on HomeODathv as Allied to
Therapeutics." Among other things lv
that as tarly as iv.i Hahnemann recognized
what had ! n done as a strictly modern Inno
! vation in pathology, namely, the ascribing of
disease t i the presence of germ*, in that year
he wrote that "cholera wj~ caused I â  > organ
isms which were ci nveyed by the air." and he
advised the administration of material doses
in order to destroy these pestiferous microbes.
He rave- as a chief characteristic ot modern
medicine the >tudy of organs and invalidation
of promises, thus being again in line with mod
ern thought. Professor Wood n 'tes as a chief
I feature distinguishing the homeopathic from
â¢he allopathic schtx I the fact that the former
deals with manifestations of disease rather
than Its sbsenee.
The section in sanitary science was presided
over by .1 W, Lesure of Batavla, X. Y. The
, -ivist Important address was made by General
M ii Terry of L'tlca, X. V., ex-surgeon gen
eral oJ the National Guard of New York. He

smile and a kiss. To be sure, she looks a
little white and pallid, but she is vivacious
and cheerful in his presence, and he does
not realize that anything is wrong-. If he
had but come home during the middle of
the day, he would have found, instead of
the cheerful wife, a weak, sickly, nervous
invalid, with headache, pains in the back,
"stitches'" in the side, burning and drag-
ging down sensations and utter despond-
ency and melancholy.
In almost every ease of this kind the
woman is really suffering from weakness
and disease of the distinctly feminine or-
ganism. Frequently she does not realize
her own condition. If she does, she
shrinks from undergoing the "examina-
tions" and "local treatments" insisted
upon by the average physician. Dr.
Pierces Favorite Prescription is the medi-
cine needed by women who suffer in this
way. It acts directly on the sensitive or-
gans concerned and makes them strong,
healthy and vigorous. It allays inflamma-
tion, heals ulceration, soothes pain and
tones and builds up the shattered nerves.
It transforms weak, sickly, nervous, de-
spondent invalids into happy, healthy wives
and competent mothers. It fits for wife-
hood and motherhood. It makes "exam-
inations" unnecessary. Honest dealers do
not suggest substitutes for a little added
profit to be realized thereon.
" I had suffered untold misery for years with
ovarian trouble, an exhausting drain, constipa-
tion, painful periods and other annoying troub-
les." writes Mrs. Annie James, of No. 27 Seventh
Street. Memphis, Shelby Co.. Term.' "Thank

MUNICIPAL OWNERSHIP
OF ITS WATER SYSTEM
REAL ESTATE OWNERS CONFER
WITH MAYOR PHELAN.
Fully $800,000 Would Be Saved the
City Annually by Constructing
Its Own Plant.
A number of members of the Real Es
tate Owners' Association held a confer
ence with Mayor Phelan yesterday to dis
cuss municipal ownership of water works.
They were in session for some time and i
the matter was thoroughly gone over.
The Mayor called attention to chapter i
121 of the new charter, which bears di
rectly upon the matter by providing that
within one year after the charter lea
Into effect and every two years thereafter !
until the object is accomplished the City |
Engineer must submit plans and esti
mates for a system of water supply. \
There were two propositions under dis- ;
cussionâthe acquisition of the existing |
water supply and original construction.
Mr. Harris, one of the members of the I
association, was the principal speaker,
and he strongly opposed the acquisition
of the existing work, which he termed a
patchwork system, with no stable supply
of pure water.
Mayor Pbelan stated that if the city
spent $20,000,000 for a water system it i
couM sell its bonds at :;'; per cent, which I
would amount to $700,000 annually for in
terest. Based on the Spring Valley Com- \
pany's own figures on what it cost to op
erate thai plant last year, which are ex
cessive, the cost of maintenance would be .
$4*60.000 making a total expenditure of
51.1C0.000 per annum. It now costs the
city for water 51.9W.000 a year, which
would mean a clear saving of $800,000 to
the city. The Mayor said that $20,000,000 !
would bring water from Lake Tano< or I
the North Fork of the American River j
and distribute it. Engineer Smith esti
mate! the cost at $13,000,000, while Colonel
Mendcll had said it would *ost nearer
i17.000.ii00. so the Mayor had allowed an
even $20,000,000 for the work in his figures. I
The conference adjourned after the mem
bers â  ad promised to agitate the subject
among their friends throughout the city.

RUHLIN IS TO
TAKE THE LION'S
SHARE OF PURSE

HE IS THE STAR BOXER;

KENNEDY HAS TO MAKE CON

i "Will Try to Equal the Brilliant Ex- j
ample of Jeffries De Witt
Van Court Chosen
Referee.
Win or lose on Friday night, Gus Ruhlin
will take two-thirds of the purse offered
by the Excelsior Athletic Club for his
meeting with Joe Kennedy in the arena !
at Woodward's Pavilion. He is the star,
â  and following the fashion set by Fitssim
j mons, demanded the right .to dictate the
terms under which the bout will tako
place. He would not agree to make the
match otherwise, and Kennedy, ambitious I
; 10 meet a man of some reputation, was I
I compelled to accept these terms or look I
elsewhere for an opponent.
The fact that this arrangement exL-stJ
does not carry with it the Imputation that
; the men will not contest every bit of Ihe
way. On the contrary, it has urged the
California!! on to greater efforts and he '
will do all he can to be returned the â¢
victor. It means other matches, where ho
, may perhaps have the right to dictate his
terms. The same agreement was made
in the championship battle at Coney Isl
: and recently, but the spectators saw al>
the sport they desired in those eleven
! rounds of desperate lighting. Ruhlin still
j looms up as a candidate for championship
! honors, and it Is a foregone conclusion he
| will not risk any of the reputation he has
; been at such pains to build up since he |
boxed a draw with Champion Jeffries in j
j Mechanics' Pavilion some three yeard
I since.
Kennedy is not wasting a moment in his
training and although he will be a trifle
high in flesh on Friday night he does not
anticipate it will hamper him in his move
' ments.
Representatives of the boxers met yes-'
terday and selected De AVitt Van Court,
boxing Instructor of the Olympic Athletic
Club to referee. There was an extended
discussion as to the size of the rim?. It
perms in remodelling the present affair at
Woodward's Pavilion the size was
changed Crom the twenty-four-foot square
required by the Marquis of Queensberrv
rules to one of seventeen feet. Billy Mad
den objected to this when sending his bijj
fellow into competition, and held out tor
an increase in the size. After some dis
cussion it was finally agreed to Increase ,
the size to twenty f< et.
Kuhlin is still favorite in what betting
has i..-e!> .lone, at odds of 10 to 7. In the j
preliminary clever Billy (>tts is the favor
ite at 10 to S^

The past week has seen a bunching of

while it still retains the lead, does so
by a greatly narrowed margin, having
dropped two games to the tailenders, Sac

two of its three games with Oakland,
thereby strengthening' its hold on sec

with Oakland close up. Sacramento has

Mike Donlin, the star pitcher of Par.t.i
Cruz, Is going East, and Manager Tuttle's ;
cup of woe is bubbling over. A dispatch
from that city last night announced that
the management of the St. Louis team
wired to Donlin a few days ago, asking
him to name* his terms to join the Per
fectbs. Donlin set his price, which waa
promptly accepted. The St. Louis people
are now negotiating with Manag-er Tur
tle relative to purchasing Donlin's re
s' ase, and the matter is expected to bo ar
ranged to-day.
Tutile. has set a round price for the
twirler's rejea3e, but it will be cheerfully
paid and Donlin will start East next weÂ«?k
to jÂ«un the St. Louis team. Donlin's ca
reer has been phenomenal. Two yÂ«>ars
ago he played Ins first of ball, and
las: year began his professional career
with Watsonville. His departure wili se
riously cripple the Lobsters. I'nder tin:
National agreement Tuttle cannot prevent
him from going East if St. 1-ouip pays the
price demanded for his release, so hI! lint
remains for Tuttle to do is to drive as
good a financial bargain as possible. l>on
ii:i owes much to 'i uttle. and if he has
any gratitude he will refuse to sign a St.
Louis contract unless Tuttle is [.am a sum
far in . xcess of the class rate stipulated
by the Nation.il agreement. Tin- St. Louis i
people have plenty of money and would
willingly pay $1000 for a pitcher who 1.1:1
pull them out of the hole they have falld'.i
Into. Â«
The Senators are going to cans*' the '
other teams some unhappy momenta
hereafter. After winning tv.<> straight
from the Lobsters, Kripp rushed off to
the telegraph office and secured Mike
O'Connor, the star tirst baseman of the
.'.. funct Texas league, and is negotiating
with another top-notcher Inflelder. Wiiii
these new men and Harvey and Doyle .if
to their speed the Senators will come up
with a rush. Tiie Sacramento public is
supporting the team loyally, the last tWO
games drawing Immense crowds.
nig Ed Hut. inns. .n could noi agree upon
t. tins with Manager Knpp and lias re
fused to play with Sacramento any more.
Cal Ewlng is understood to have mad<
Hutch an offer to play tin- bag for Oak
land, ami if it i< accepted the team will
gain a X"".l man.
Pace got just what he has been looking
fni for a long time when lie went up
against Umpire O'Connell at Sacramento
Sunday night. Pace made a cowardly at
tack on O'Connell, rushing up behind him ;
and striking him <'ii t ti â¢ - Bide of the head.
Jack respondej] with a right-hander on the
eye ;:: .! Pace wi tit down. When he got on
his feet again O'Connell planted left and
right, closing the other eye and cutting
Ills mouth. Pace went down again and
held on to O'Conneiis legs to save himself
fi.m further punishment. Later he went
into the hotel, and securing a hatchet re
turned to the attack. O'Connell caught
him with left and right again, and Pace
we,n down crying like a baby. A police
man took him in tow before O'Conneil
could Inflict any more punishment, yester
day th" league directors met and liii'-'l
Pi â¢â â â  $r>(i for his ruffianly conduct. The
tine must be paid within ten days or iitÂ».
will be suspended. O'Connell received Die
congratulations of every member of the
Santa Cruz team for his good work.
Another member of the Lobsters was
Kft "it Sacramento Sunday night with a
pair of badly damaged optics. Monkey
Burge, who prides himself on his prowess.,
induced Truck Eean to don the gloves
with him at the athletic club, and when
Truck got through with him Monkey
needed .â : dog to grutde him t.> his hotel.
The Watsonville team has passed from
the management of I'M Struvc and is now
controlled by a committee of citizens,
which has installed Harper as field man
ager, with full control of the players.
Some new talent is lining negotiated" for,
as it is the committee's intention to make
the team the strongest in the league, both
in fielding and batting. Harper's promo
tion is most deserving, for he thoroughly
understands the game and is an excellent :
tactician.
It might he a good Idea for Manager
Ewing to try Russell in two games
against the Lobsters this week. Their
heaviest batters are left-handers and have
little success against south side twlrlers.
The local team hits hard enough to win
almost any B'amc, but stupid base run
ning costs it many runs. A few judicious
fines by Manager Harris might teach his
men how to act on the plates.
San Jose is now playing an almost per
fect fielding game, but its batting- is lam
entably weak. Chief Borchers ought to
make his men practice batting every day,
sending in his fast delivery himself for
them to work on. With their batting
lamps properly trimmed the Gardeners
will be in it.
Iberg was subjected to the severest
drubbing by Oakland last Sunday morn
ing lv has received since he has been in
the game. Seven hits for six runs was
what be was batted for in the first in
ning. After that he steadied down and
the Dudes seenred only one more run.
Hammond. Oakland's catcher, is laid
up with a bad foot, and will probably not
be able to go into the games this week.
This will necessitate putting THinleavy
behind the bat and Shea in left field.

MARVELOUSLY FAST RIDE
DISTANCE COVERED IN SIXTY
FIVE SECONDS.
The Wheelman Shielded From the
Wind by a Contrivance Built
Upon His Steam-Driven
Pacemaker.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, June 21.â A man on a
bicycle rode a mile to-day faster than
any one ever before traveled the same
distance by self-propulsion. The man
was Charles M. Murphy, and he rode
the mile in sixty-five seconds. It was
done as honestly, cleanly and in as
sportsmanlike a manner as any bicycle
ever was ridden. His sole advantage
was a locomotive with one car at
tached, which set the pace and enabled
him to ride in a partial vacuum. No
straps or tow ropes or harness were
employed. He rode naturally, simply
keeping close to the car by rapid pedal
ing. It was a wonderful performance
and a spectacle of thrilling interest. .
The scene of the ride was the central
branch of the Long Island Kailroad,
five miles long, between Farmingdale
and Babylon.
At the rear of the car a box-like
structure had been built to shield the
; rider from the wind. The sides ex
! tended straight out six feet and down
ward to within two feet of the ground,
where they slanted inward toward the
track at an angle of 40 degrees. The
bottoms of the wind-shielding exten
sion lapped over the inner sides of the
rails, setting close to them like flanges
to exclude all the air and dust possible.
\\ iihin the shielding Fides of this con
trivance Murphy pedaled for more than
i two miles, swerving only for a few
' inches and never losing his tremendous,
I steam-driven pacemaker. lie was bare
i headed and wore no eyeglasses, nose or
mouth shield or any kind of appliance.
He rode a bicycle of the regular stock
racing model, weighing twenty-one
pounds and geared to 112, with ordinary
wire toeclips.
There were three-quarters of a mile
to- be traveled before the real trial be
gan, for the board track was more than
two miles long, and nearly a half-mile
was left for slowing up. The cyclist
pedaled faster and faster, his wheel
never failing away an inch from its
Position and swaying from side to side
only five inches. There were five
planks, each ten inches wide, compos
ing the track. Murphy rode the entl it
distance on the middle c-ne and used
only half of that.
As the starting lino was crossed there
was a slight but perceptible increase In
the speed <>f the engine. "Surely the
rider must be lost," thought tin- watch
| ers; but Murphy, except for a slight
I side swaying, did not change his posi
tion. From start to finish the rate of
I speed varied only by the fractions of
a second in each quarter-mile.
Spectators had previously ridden over
the course in one minute and eight
seconds when the engineer was trying
himself and his engine Then it seemed
lik" a flying leap from one end of the
board to the other, but now with a
cyclist riding there under their feet it
seemed like an hour.
The first quarter was traveled in
:16 2-5; the second in :16 3-5, and the
third in :16 1-6.
As the lust quarter was begun the
car bounded just a little from some
unknown cause. The cyclist then fell
away for the <>nly time in the ride.
He dropped back four or five inches and
every heart stood still, but a second
more and he was back again, his legs
moving like piston rods as before.
When the finish line was crossed the
rider threw up his head and Hashed
a grinning countenance at the watch
ers.
The engineer, as soon as the finishing j
mark was crossed, opened the throttle j
and the train bounded away at seventy
miles an hour, thereby leaving Murphy,
who probably would have been unable
to slow away from the car had this not
been done.
Murphy is convinced he can ride a
mile a minute, and so is every one who
witnessed th< j trial to-day. He will
make the attempt on June 30. at the
State League of American Wheelmen
meet.

AT DYING PUGILIST
"Dutch" Neal Suffers a Hemorrhage
of the Brain While Fighting
Harry Peppers.
CHICAGO, June 21.â 1n the sixth round
of a boxing bout between "Dutch" XÂ°al
of St. Louis and Harry Peppers of t.os
Angeles at the Adelphi Theater to-night
Neal made a wild riprht-hand swing. Pep
pers easily evaded it. and stepping in land
ed a ligrht left jolt at short range on
Meal's Jaw. Neal reeled back and finally
s;mk down, but the blow of his adversary
appeared so light and weak that the
crowd quickly decided the pugilist hrjd
fallen to a soft spot on the canvas and
intended to earn his money more easily
thon is usual. Loud cries of "He's a
fakir! Take him off!" rang from the. front
of the house, and even the "wise men"
grouped r.bout the ring entertained the
same opinion
Lou Houseman, manager of the rliow.
stopped to the ropes and after glancing
at the prostrate man said to Referee
George Siler:
"This looks liko a soft spot for Neai to
fall in. Tell the people in front Xeal has
quit, but Peppers had no hand in what
appears to be a fake. Tell them Peppers
will get both the winner's and the loser's
end of the purse."
Siler mpdf his way to the footlights and
awarded the entire purse to Peppers. In
the meantime "Kid" McGlynn, who was
in Neal'B corner, had picked up Xeal. who
had rolled out of the ring, and carried
him to his chair. At that time Xeal ap

was. perfectly conscious, but when he
heard Siler's announcement he suddenly
and unexpectedly suffered a relapse, and
quickly became unconscious. His han
dlers carried him to a niche in the stage
and began working over him. To all ap
pearances the pugilist was in a bad way.
His own friends were not impressed with
the seriousness of his condition until all
the usual restoratives had failed to bring
him back to consciousness. His body grew
rigid and there was a hurry call for a
doctor.
An examination proved that Neal was
suffering from hemorrhage of the brain
and that he was completely paralyzed.
It is doubtful if he lives till daylight.
Peppers left the theater and the police
are now looking for him. Houseman and
Siler have notified the authorities where
they may be found if wanted.
GODDARD LOSES ON A FOUL.
Strikes His Colored Opponent When.
the Latter Is Down.
CHICAGO. June 21.â Joe Goddard, the
Australian heavy-weight, lost on a foul
to "Klondike." a local colored heavy
weight, in the fifth round of what was to
have been a six round contest at the
Adelphi Theater to-night. After the first
round the men apparently forgot all about
science and went at it rough and tumble.
In the fourth round Goddard threw the
colored man and hit him while on the
floor.

Enterprises of this nd have become common to
the British by reason of the fact that they have long
had a surplus capital seeking investment in all parts
of the world. It is only recently, however, that the
capitalists of the United States have given them even
a casual consideration. Our own country has afforded
such inviting opportunities of ail kinds that we have
imported capital from abroad and have not thought of
ending it to other land; A change has come over
the minds of Eastern capitalists of late. They are no
longer content with the inducements offered by the
West and the South for investments, but are rivaling
the British themselves in the extent to which they are
venturing enterprises beyond the seas.

A VOICE FROM INYO
f~\ S 'hr rn^n to whom the Democrats of the nation
\ for leadership and guidance are apparently
* * too much muddled even to direct their own steps,
murh less those i I ty, the editors of the Demo
cratic â â -â  â  â ' y have to 1 oe their
own row and to preach such gospel as they can de
vise out of their individual faith for the enlighten
ment of their readers.
In this emergency the Inyo Independent comes
forward with a platform and a candidate, each- of
which has some merit, and that is more than can be
said of the dogmas and the tickets proposed by the
organs of Democracy in larger cities and of greater
pretensions.
erning the matter of campaign issues the In
dependent says the "anti-Republicans n^ed but one

plank in their platform to settle the business at the
next Presidential election, the same being anti
administratioa." The merit of that :â .â 'â -. is its
brevity, a thing not to be despised in this day of many
words. It is also one which will command the sup
port of all the calamity howlers in the nation, for it
signifies opposition to a!! the great administration
policies which have â¢â -â --- â¢-:>â¢ at home and
increased our prestige abroad.
On the subject of candidates the Independent says:
"At present no man stands prominent if we except
Bryan, whose financial views will -â . him for a suc
cessful candidate. Gorman, a Southern man, is not
available. Our own State â we will give the ex-
United States Senator the credit for honesty and ca
pabiiities â cannot furnish a standard-bearer. Who
next? Why not Cleveland? Of all the men in the
Democratic ranks he is the one who is on the proper
side of the issues of the times."
There you have it. Grover Cleveland, standing on
a single plank, and representing nothing but opposi
tion to the administration, is the sum and substance
of the politics of the Independent. It is unquestion
ably clear and strong There may be confusion
among the Democrats of all other parts oi the
United States, but there is none in Inyo.

WHAT WE DO NOT NEED.

i, informs Gage. Burr.= and all others
interest! tf there is -c thing more than
another that the State of Califorr.ia doesn't need. '
and can pet along without, it is an ext-a session of
the Legislature."
LeÂ«t th2t sithple notice should not be sufficient, the
â¢ L ' nto -^ay to the Governor, the would-be
set tor and all other- concerned: "We can worry
alone with the Hessian fly, if it comes, the Canadian
thistle, the white, purple and black scale, a dry s<? - a

but considering the experience had with the regular

Then* by way of emphatic conclusion, and for *V
purpose of impressing the gaits <-â :' the extra session
schemers, our warning contemporary adds: "It will
take at least two years to Ret things disinfected up at
the capita!, and the man with the chloride of lime and
â¢ :>eras can should not be interfered with. Let
it? have no more stenche* until they come along in
the regular course of events."
The argument is not long and is so clear that even
the Governor and the man of the <=ide-tracked Sena

rued to be added only that it rer>re=entÂ« the universal
sentiment of the taxpayers of the State. When they

After Professor Cory had finished his
an open discussion occupied the
rime and attention of the association. The
next paper waÂ« read by L. A. Hicks. His
subject wa? "Electrically Driven Centrif
ugal Pump?" He said:
"The drought of the past two years in ,
California has been product great
-ion in the manufaci r< I pumps

cemporaneout .â  ment of numei

that distance comes to be of
decreasing Importance, is favorable
to the continued utilization ol
pumping as a means of supplying -water
for irrigated land, insuring crops in dry
years and so maintaining land \ alues and
load factor?. " The speaker then went
into a technical consideration of centrif
ugal pumps and their value. After a care
ful analysis Mr. Hicks concluded with the
following:
"The application of this philosophy to
the centrifugal pump leads to the con
clufdon that a properly deigned plant of
this type in units up to 5,000.006 gallons
capacity is economically superior to any
other possible installation, and that where
circumstances are favorable to the use
of electricity the simplicity, compactness
and automatic regulation of these plants
are unex<-el!*-d. ' - must

CONSTERNATION
IN THE COUNTY
CLERK'S OFFICE
The Force Must Be
Greatiy Reduced.
The Justices of the Supreme Court yes
terday handed down a decision which
caused consternation in the County
Clerk's office and cast a deep gloom into
the hearts of nearly a hundred employes,
many of whom stand every chance of
losing their political jobs.
The decision was in the case of the
city and county of San Francisco against
William Broderlck, as Auditor. The ac
tion was instituted last year to enjoin the
Auditor from allowing- the demands of
certain assistant registry clerks and copy
ists appointed by the then County Clerk
Curry. The Auditor demurred to the pe
tition and his demurrer was sustained.
The petitioner refused to amend and
judgment of dismissal was ordered, from
which an appeal was taken. Th Su
preme Court says that the principal ques
tion is not as much the right of the Clerk
to appoint as it is of the duty of the city
to pay the salaries of his appointees. The
court says:
Section -â â  â¢'â¢-.â¢ county government act i; I
the section containing the authority -which it is j
contended authorized these appointments. It I
is a general section and read? as follows: j
"Every county, township and district officer, I
except a Supervisor or judicial officer, may mp- i
point as many deputies as may be firmans j
for th- prompt and faithful discharge of tna
duties of his office * â¢ â¢ ." This is 'â¢â¢.-
tainly a grant of power from the Legislature
to the â -.â ??â : en at officers, authorizing then to
appoint necessary deputies, bat the question 1
of the compensation of these deputies when i
appointed, is auite 3 different matter. It does
not fo!!cw that because the deputies may be |
appointed, their salaries must be paid by the >
county. * â¢ â¢ Such a construction would re- â¢
nit in a grievous interference with the coun
ty funds and would come clearly within the
purview of section 13. article XI of the con- '
stitution. â¢ â¢ *
In conclusion the court says:
The County Clerk of the city and county of
San Francisco by the act of February 13, 1880,
is given a fixed salary, and is allowed a fiiM
number of deputies and assistants, whose com
pensation la a charge upon the treasury. He ;
has the Dower under section 6! of the County
Government Act to anoint additional depu
tie? ar.l a c <;star.t<= If the needs of his office so I
require, but in the present condition of thÂ» j
law the compensation of these extra assist
ants and deputies must bÂ« paid for by himself
The Judgment Is therefore reversed, with di
rections to the trial court to overrule the Au
ditor's demurrer
In the case of Harry Piper, as chief {
deputy clerk with a salary of $250 per
month, the court says: "The office here
In question was created by an act of the
Legislature, approved February 14 lg?i
Judgment appealed from is affirmed
Under the decision the County Clerk
is allowed eight courtroom clerks, eight
register clerks, seven assistant register i
clerks, one copy clerk, two record clerks
and three copyist?, a total of twenty-nine
; employes. Under the present system" there
are twelve courtroom clerks, twelve regis- i
j ter clerks, twenty-four assistant register
; clerks, twenty-nine copyistsâ a total of
i seventy-seven employes.
CHARTER TEST CASE.
Demurrer Sustained and the Matter
Now Goes to Supreme Court.
Through an agreement of counsel Judge
Hebbard yesterday made a pro forma or
der sustaining the demurrer of the Elec
tion Commissioners to the petition of the
county officers for an injunction to re
strain the placing of their offices In the
election proclamation and on the ballots
under the charter. From the order made
by Judge Hebbard an appeal will be taken
by George D. Collins, who represent? the
officials, and the matter will be arpned

The Tearful Condition of Defendant's
Wife in Court Led to a Disclos
ure of the Pacts in the
Case.
A woi bathed in tears and har'r:*
three young children beside her aroused
considerable sympathy if. Judge Tr?Â£d
well's court yesterday rnomiiig,- She uss
Mrs. Thomas Fallen, and her husband
was accused of p-etty larceny in stealing
two pool balls from the Metroprie saloon,
on Market street, a week ago. He was
drunk and did not know what he w&3
doing. When arrested his wife put up
Jl5O cash ball for his release.
The case came up for trial yesterday,
and the Judge felt inclined to deal se
verely with the defendant, which cause 1
the wife's tears to Sow. Sosce one touk
pity on the wife and asked her what was
the matter. She told her story, and sail
that she had given two lawyers VM :o
get her nnsfcand out cf his trouble, but
she was afraid he would be sent to jail.
The Jucire was notified and he sent for
Mrs. Fallon. She repeated her statement
that she had riven SIOO to the attorneys,
which siaee^red hid, as the attorney?,
Webb and Caldweii, had told him that:
they were defending the case out of char
ity. Mrs. Fal'.on said that she and her
husband had succeeded in savin? $300 out
cf his eamines as a steam niter, ir.d
that was why'she had the money to pay
the attorneys, who represented to her
that the case was a serious one.
The Judse sent for Webb, and he Snal'y
admitted "that he had got the $100. but
whatever Sre Fallen had to pay woulg te
taken out of It The Judge was lnd!g
nant and demanded that part of the
money should be returned, and $*'â¢ wn*
reluctantly handed over to Mrs. Fallon.
Th* Judee then, after consulting Pro-e
--cutingr Attorney rpent< suspended
sentence for thirty day? and allowed Fal
lon to so on his own recognizance.
It appeared that Fallen had cor.c in:o
the saloon drunk and took up different Â£i"
ti'-lps in a playful manner and replace i
them. The two pool balls he put In h^3
pocket and forgot all aVvut them til' h^
was arrested. For defending him on <=;:Â«-!i
a Bin* charee a fee of tICO was consid
ered out of all reason, but added to that
was the statement that the defense v?\*
conducted cut of charity, so as to set a
nominal fine imposed.

OF URBAN DEMOCRATS
Factions Lining Up for the
Battle of the Primaries.
Usurpation of Power by the Committee
or One Hundred Is Resented.
The Programme Scorned
ACTIVITY in the ramps of the differ
ent political parties is becoming
more and more manifest day by
tiny, and within a short time after
I the coming national anniversary it
will certainly reach the zenith.
Up to date there is greater activity
thown among the Democrats. The r?asor.
possibly for this is that the bickerings
among Republicans for jobs that have
failed to materialize and the bitter ani
mosities caused by the. recent Senatorial
light have inspired the Democrats with
i he belief that this is a Democratic year.
While the VunterrilledV are seemingly
enthusiastic*,: and a? a result two and three
;:hs have been organized by them in
l .eh of the eighteen Assembly districts,
>-t. to use the common political phrase.
there Is "low down" a bitter and fiercely
hostile sentiment prevailing among piem.
All torts of minors till the air. Buckley
clubs here. Committee of One Hur.drt-d
clubs there. Rainey and Lannigan lubs
untl independent clubs elsewhere, can be
heard of on al! sides. The battle is on.
and henceforward r-ntil the primary ia\\
Dii August S. the Democrats are bound to
lino up, and on that day the iire along
the line will be fast and furious.
The un.-u: masses of the local' Demo
cracy have not forgotten the haughty
measures carried through last year, re
eulting ii; the appointment of the Com
mittee of One Hundred. The action of the
new men who control the One Hundred in
I heir manipulation with country members
ct the State Central Committee in depriv
ing the voters here of a voice in the man
agement of their own party affairs, must
be avenged. This can only be accom
plished by a complete discomfiture of the
ticket the Committee of One Hundred will
endeavor to carry through at the ap
proaching primary /or delegates to the
wining municipal convention; Massed up
against tile ruie of the one Hundred are
Bcme of the best and most representative
numbers of the party. It is realized on all
Bides that the domination of the One Hun
dred brought ruin and disaster to the or
ganization last November. To be victo
rious, the large body of the party believe
that the action of last year must hi re
buked by a decisive vote at the primary,
ai.e those leaders, such as the McNab.3;
i Poppers and Braunharts, must be rele
gated to a back seat in 1 he party councils.
These leaders in the promotion of Dem
ocratic discord seem to be doubly am
bitioua this year to continue their reign of
3isorgan:zation and defeat. At the last
meeting of the 100 the chairman was au
thorized to appoint an executive commit
;ee of eighteen; who in turn are to estab
lish headquarters and conduct the pri
mary campaign in the interest of the gen
?ral committee. It is asserted that in the
appointment of this committee of eigh
teen that the programmers violated the
trust reposed in the local committee by
!he Democratic State Central Committee.
The 100 were, appointed by the State
Central Committee, and simultaneous
with their appointment they were handed
a. constitution for their government.
Section 2 of said constitution reads:
"The Democratic City and County Com
mittee shall have no power to delegate to
my r>ther committee or persons any of the
powers hereby conferred on it except as
aerein provided."
Section 3 reads:
"The Democratic City and County Com
mittee, shall have power to appoint all dis
:rict or precinct committees and all sub
committees that it shall from time to time
item expedient, solely for the purpose of
Investigating and reporting to said Demo
:rat!c City and County Committee upon
any matter with regard to which It may
oe directed to investigate and report."
Section 4 reads:
"None of said committees shall con
:inue in existence except for the purpose
5f reporting to the Democratic City and
County Committee beyond the time of the
aext meeting of the Â»aid Democratic City
and County Committee and not longer
than thirty days In any event."
The committee of eighteen was not ap
pointed to Investigate anything. It was
appointed solely and simply for the pur
pose of conducting a campaign in the
Interest of the "bosses," who control the
committee of one hundred. These would
be bosses have discovered that it Is much
easier to manage a small committee of
eighteen than the larger one of 100, which
has already, so it is said, shown itself
unwieldy and difficult to handle. At the
meeting at which this executive com
mittee was provided for by resolution
there were only forty-five members pres
ent, and section 15 of the constitution
reads:
"No action of the Democratic City and
I County Committee or its successors shall
be valid or of any effect except as herein
otherwise provided, unless said action is
taken by a vote of three-fifths of all the
members of said Democratic City and
County Committee."
It will be observed that even if the
100 had the power to transfer any author
ity to an executive committee, then the
resolution creating the executive com
mittee did not have the necessary votes
to carry it. Sixty votes were necessary,
and as only forty-five were present it is
difficult to understand by what process
of reasoning Chairman McDonald de
clared the resolution carried. The Demo
cratic voters were absolutely ignored
when the Committee of One Hundred was
originally created: and now the said com
mittee has absolutely ignored the consti
tution which it was pledged to support.
It is noted that the several factions of
the Democratic party are now extremely
active in the enrollment of voters. The
keenest observers are not able to explain
fully the significance of this early activity.
Buckley's strength in the party is stiil
an unknown quantity. He is working
nitrht and day and constantly receiving
suggestions from lieutenants who were
at. one time rated as successful politi
cians. The problem is still unsolved
whether Buckley is in the field to organ
ize a machine for the future control of
k the party, or simply taking part in th's
I campaign to serve the cause of some big
corporation. Openly he is not oppose I to
the renomination of Mayor Phelan.
Whether his attitude in this respect will
change after the election of delegates to
the convention is a matter of conjecture.
Gavin McKab holds to the opinion that
Buckley will cut but a small figure in
the forthcoming campaign. He regards
the Bui key following as insignificant, be
lieving that the strength of the Buckley
clubs is overestimated. In his judgment
Buckley is simply working the wires to
get some delegates In the convention and
secure the nomination of a few Super-
visors. â â¢"â ' , v -
The Call has endeavored to ascertain
the real strength of the contending looil
factions of the Democracy, and to bring
to light the real purposes of recently or
ganized clubs.
In the Twenty-eighth Assembly District
there are three lbs. The club organ
ized by Maxwell and Hocy undoubtedly
represents the Committee of One Hundred.
There Is a Buckley Club in this district,
and' also a third club. John F. McGov
erri and Larry Buckley have been active
in the organization or the third or inde
pendent clubs, and overtures for- a com
bine have been received by them from
the One Hundred Club and the Buckley
crowd. The district is entitled to fifteen
delegates in the convention. It is proba
ble that two oJKtbe clubs will combine
and each take seven delegates. The dice
can be thrown for the odd delegate.
In the Twenty-ninth District it appears
that the Kainey and Buckley men are
combining to down Senator Braunhart.
A Rainey Club is being organized by Joe
Flannagan and others. Gibney and Tom
Eagan are reported to be active in or
ganizing the Buckley forces. Braunhart
Is the accredited representative of the
â¢I'-'ommittee of One Hundred in this dis
trict. The combine bids fair to wallop
i he Senator.
In the Thirtieth District, P. .T. Tomalty
speaks for the One Hundred. The oppos
ing forces have organized a club and so
Tomalty must put up a vigorous fight to
win the delegates. Whether the opposi
tion represents Buckley is not clear.
Many independent Democrats are pro
testing against the usurpation of power
by the One Hundred and they may unite
with the new flock of lambs in support
of a 'iÂ» legate ticket.

HIT WITH A CRIB BOARD.
Ex-Justice of the Peace Carroll As-
sainted During a Game of
Euchre.
John A. Carroll, attorney and ex-Jus
tire of the Peacp, appeared in Judge Con

over his left eye. He told the Judge that !
he had been viciously assaulted the pre- I
vious r.iKht. and ho waninl h warrant fur

In answer to the Judge he said: "It

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JUNE 22, 1599.
Oa/uLgtLt in a,n Eleotrioeil Storm.
The schooner W. S. Phelps, laden with gunpowder, dynamite and other explosives, was caught in three
thunder and lightning storms during the voyage from San Francisco to Champerico. While the lightning was
playing about the masts and rigging the officers and crew were in momentary anticipation of being blown to
atoms.
HAIR RAISING
EXPERIENCE OF
THE W. S. PHELPS
Lightning and Cargo
of Dynamite.
The crew of the schooner W. S. Phelps
had an experience that they never want
to duplicate during the voyage from San
Francisco to ''hamperico. The tight little
vessel went down in twenty-nine days,
a run that has not been equaled in years.
but that fact brings no consolation to
the sailors, and every time they think of
that voyage their hearts come up in their
mouths and their hair stands on end.
The W. S. Phelps was loaded with gun
powder, dynamite and other explosives.
During that run of twenty-nine days
three storms, accompanied by thunder
and lightning, were encountered; hut
while the wind watt fair the schooner
could never run away from the light
ning. It would burn on the, mastheads
like an electric li^ht and made a must
artistic display on the running rigging.
For a few moments v would be as light
as day and the next it would be as dark
as Erebus. Seas were constantly break
ing aboard and it was blowing a gale,
but the crew paid no attention to those
minor details. AVhat they watched with
breathless interest was the lightning and
each thunder dap was hailed with a sigh
of relief that the danger was temporarily
passed.
On an ordinary occasion Captain Nick
erson of the Fhelp.s would have t nought
nothing of the thunder and lightning
storms, but the accompanying cargo of
dynamite under his feet while the pyro
technic display was going on will make
him remember that Voyage as long as he
lives.
Thomas Gorman and Jerry Connor met
with a peculiar and painful accident on
the transport Sheridan yesterday. Both
are employes of the Fulton Iron Works
and were engaged on the repairs being
made on the transport's boilers. While
they were at work a man named Thomas
Murrey passed over the grating in the
'tween deck with a can of paraffine paint.
He stumbled and dropped the can. spilling
the contents Into the boiler room.
A considerable Quantity of the paint fell
(in Gorman, and on looking up and seeing
what had happened he got from under.
In doing so he stepped "ii a lighted candle
and that set the paint on his clothes
afire. Connor went to his assistance and
got burned in saving Gorman. Both men
were treated at the Harbor Hospital and
then Gorman was sent to St. Mary's Hos
pital, while Connor was s<>nt home. Gor
man was badly burned about the face,
head, neck and arms. <'onnor was burned
aboul the hands and wrists.

TRIAL OF O. M. WELBURN.
Government Closed Its Case Yester
day and the Defense Will
Be Taken Up.
The Government closed its rase in the
Welburn trial yesterday and the case for
the defense will be opened by Attorneys
McNab and Gould at 10 o'clock this morn
ing.
W. H. Dillard. the colored clerk, was
on the stand yesterday and admitted that
he signed Welpurn's mime to reports, etc..
by order of Air. Welburn. He said that
he had also signed the name of E. C.
Akins to checks on Welburn's order. He
knew that he was doing wrong at the
time, but he wanted to hold his position,
and he could do that only by obeying the
orders of his superior.
W. L. Zoller, formerly a. clerk under
Welburn, testified that his salary was at
the rate of $YX.*) per year. The vouchers
were made for larger amounts. He could
not tell what those amounts were, be
cause he hypothecated his salary every
nv'tith. George E. Dabovich gave similar
testimony as to his salary.
A misapprehension exists as to the tes
timony or Agent Thomas on Tuesday with
reference to his breaking open a desk in

desk. l>u! Louoe'S, and the letters "that

MRS. STERETT
RECOVERS HER
LOST JEWELRY
Mysteriously Stolen
From Her Home.
The jewelry and silverware, valued at
, about $2000, which were supposed to have
been stolen from the residence of Mrs.
Emma Sterett, who figured as one of the |
! claimants to the estate of Gustav Wal
j ter, deceased, have been recovered by
j Detective Harper. They were traced to a
pawnshop at lOVz Stockton street, where
I they had been sold for about one-fifth their !
value. The supposed burglary occurred j
in August. WS. Mrs. Sterett had been |
visiting a friend, and on her return she
was amazed to find that her jewelry and
silverware had been taken during her ah- :
j sence. She at once notified the police, and i
Detective Harper was detailed to find the |
stolen property. After a short Investiga- !
tion he became convinced that the house
j had not been entered but that the jewelry
! and silverware had been taken by one of
the family.
By close inquiry the detective soon
I learned that the property had been
! pawned to Aaron and Leo Heringhi. who \
i then conducted a loan office at lo^ Stock- â 
i ton street. Harper told them that the j
jewelry was the property of Mrs. Sterett,
and warned them not to dispose of it \
until he had an opportunity to see her. j
A few days later Mrs. Sterett -visited the
i pawnshop and after identifying her jew- !
airy promised to return and redeem it.
On May 2 last Leo Heringhi, who has
since purchased his brother's Interest in
the pawnshop, sent Mrs. Sterett a writ- i
ten notice. Informing her that unless she \
redeemed the property, it would be sold
:at public auction. Not hearing from her i
| and concluding that she did not want
the jewelry, he sold it on May 17 at a
general sale of unredeemed pledges.
| On learning that her property had been
' disposed of Mrs. Sterett became indig- '
| nant. and at once hunted up Detective
; Harper, to whom she told the story of I
how the pawnbroker had sold her jew- i
elry. Harper lost no time in visiting
Heringhi' 8 place of business and pro- ;
ceeded to call him to account. Heringhi
explained that the articles had been in
pawn since the commission of the al
leged burglary, and that as no attempt
i had been made to redeem them he was '
i justified under the law in selling them to i
, the highest bidder. He readily gave the
j names of the persons who had bought the i
i stuff and, with the exception of a dia- '
i mono collar button the detective has
recovered all the stolen property. The
collar button was purchased by a man j
i named Livingston, who has promised to !
i turn it over to the police to-day.
Yesterday Mrs. Sterett visited lh'?|
I pawnshop and anxiously inquired about i
the diamond coilar button, which she
prizes very highly. She threatens
unless the article is promptly returned to
commence suit against the pawnbroker
for its recovery.
Heringhi. when seen last night, said j
that his brother had taken the jewelry in i
j pawn. He did not know that it was stolen I
i property, as he was given to understand
I by the person who "soaked" it that it
I belonged to a friend who was In need. I
\ He declared that after learning thnt the j
j jewelry was the property of Mrs. Sterett
j he communicated with her. advising her
! to redeem it or suffer having it sold at I
i public auction. Ap she ignored the notice
ho sold the stuff alrn.fr with a number of
other articles at auction.

HEALTH BOARD
SLATE STILL
IS UNBROKEN
Machete Falls With
Monotony.
The burden of this world's woes still
rests upon the hacks of Secretary Dunne
of the Board of Health and his follow
ers, who are seeking to enjoin their dis
missal. From last night's meeting of the
hoard, however, it Is manifest that they
have grave cause for worry and awn it
with anxiety the decision of Judge Hunt
upon their action against the board, for
never was a slate greased more smoothly
than the one on which the favored clan
is now riding Into office. Lasi night the
machete fell With wearying; rhythm, and
when it ceased the. police hospitals were
naked of familiar faces. Other offices
were declared vacant and the vacant
places were tilled with a speed th;iL
proves prearrangement, notwithstanding
the statement of Dr. Coffey and his as
sociates that the Influences which placed
them in power demand no consideration
and are receiving none. If such is the
case, it remains to be seen just where
Dennery lands, If he lands.
-Members of the board were in their
places shortly alter g o'clock, and after a
small amount of routine business was dis
posed of the machete was drawn from its
sheath and began to cleave. The rirst
name to be called up w.ts that of Dr. Wil
liam S. Hereford, City Physician, and,
without s formal address. Dr. Keeney,
who seems to be the leader of the solid
majority of the board, cheerfully second
ed a motion u> declare the office occupied
by Dr. Hereford vacant on the 30th inst.
The resolution was seconded, anil Dr.
Hereford went out. Dr. J. O'Connor was
promptly placed in nomination, and with
out a dissenting voic< was appointed to
rill the vacancy. The matter of vacating
offices and immediately tilling them was
now under way, and with a merry-go
round regularity the members of the
board rose on,, after the other, offered a
resolution declaring an office vacant on
the 30th inst., nominated their men and
gently smiled as he was elected per pro
gramme.
Dr. Conrad Wlel, Police Surgeon, was
removed, and Dr. I". J. Heintz appoint-id
to till the vacancy; Dr. McMurray, Assist
air. City Physician, was removed, and Dr.
William M. Btrry appointed as his suc
cessor, and then in the following order
they went out and came In: Dr. Fitz^ib
b< i.s. Assistant Police Surgeon, removed,
Dr. George 11. Thompson appointed to the
vacancy; Dr. F. Bonnell. Assistant Po
lice Surgeon, removed. Dr. H. E. Mor

Police Surgeon, removed. Dr. G. H. Holms
appointed to the vacancy; Dr. Van der
Leith, Assistant Police Surgeon, removed.
Dr. W. â¢'. Hopper appointed to Mil the
vacancy; Dr. J. C. Spencer, bacteriologist,
removed. Dr. W. F. Barbat appointed Ll >
the vacancy; Frank T. Green, chemi-u, re
moved, A. C. Bothem appointed to thÂ« va
cancy; Dr. W. P. Chalmers, quarantine
physician, removed, Dr. J. K. Conn ap
pointed to the vacancy; Dr. E. 1.,. p.irra
mcre, vaccinator. removed. Dr. George E.
McPherson appointed to the vacancy: Dr.
T. B. Roche, temporary resideni physician
of the City and County Hospital, removed,
Dr. T. Maher appointed to the vacancy;
Will D. Griffin, statistician, removed, Ed
ward Carroll appointed to the vacancy:
W. M. Hickmann. druggist of the City and
County Hospital, removed, James Galwey
appointed to the vacancy.
This ended the removals, but other ap
pointments to vacancies were mad.'.
Thomas Brophy was appointed messenger
of the board. J. R. Quinn porter of the
City and County Hospital and Frank Ce
celio outside watchman at the Almshouse.
The work of vacating and appointin??
done, the board appeared pleased, as
doubtless It was.
Prior to drawing the beheading instru
ment the resignation of J. W. Dwyer. an
under official, was accepted and a batch
of applications for positions placed on
file, as were a large number of instru
ments indorsing James P. Dockery. chief
I food inspector, the indorsements coming
from the most important business organi
zations, firms and corporations and many
prominent business men of the city, and a
petition asking that Miss Mary Patton be
retained in h*-r position as superintendent
of nurses. The matter of refusing to use
the Maclean hospital further as a pest
house also came up. and an order tr that
effect was made, and the application of a
nurse to be allowed to leave the institu
tion was also favorably acted imon. pro
viding that he will agree fo shave his
head and face alike and stand the fumi
gating process used to disinfect and kill
the germs of smallpox.
An application to allow the College of
Physicians and Surgeons the same num
ber of wards and beds and the same rep
resentation in the ranks of visiting physi
cians at the City and County Hospital
was also taken up and passed by the
hoard. Dr. Barhat being the only member
to vote against the application.
When the time for adjournment came it
was suggested that the board again meet
on Monday, but Dr. Kemey suggested
that an adjournment be taken to the call
lof the chair. "We want to see how good
Judge Hunt is going to be to us." said Dr.
Barbat, "before we call a meeting, and as
soon as he decides that the suit brought
by those win.) wish to retain 'heir posi
tions, notwithstanding the hoard, is with
out merit we will meet and resume our
labors." So .nded the meeting with the
slate unbroken.

EASTERN MARKETS
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. June 21.â Transactions in stocks
were of paltry proportions, but this did not
preclude some pretty wide movements of
prices. In fact the lethargy of speculation left 1
the market vulnerable at any spot where genu
ine liquidation was thrown on it. Such liquida- .
tion was undoubtedly made on all of the
Tobacco stocks. American Tobacco suffered
most severely, the extreme decline being 8%.
Continental Tobacco dropped an extreme five
points and the preferred three. Very heavy
blocks of all three stocks running from 1000
to 500 i) shares changed hands In the course of
the decline or the hesitating rebound. The
break in these stocks was due to the rumors,
which have been persistent for several days,
of dissensions in the directory on a likelihood
of, a division of resources and possible de- |
structive competition. Coming on top of the
experience of the last few days in the steel
stocks to-day's events added largely to the
sentiment of disfavor held toward a large
number of industrial stocks. The steel stocks
themselves were pretty firm on account of the i
official assurance that the money for the pr<>- ,
ferred dividend on Federal St.- I had been Bet
aside before the declaration of the dividend
on the emmon, and also because of a preva
lent belief that Steel and Wire is soon to be
entered in the regular listed department of the i
Stock Exchange, which would necessitate a i ,
detailed statement of finances and earnings, j ,
American Smelting preferred showed a good
gain. The genera] market was semi-stagnant, '
but as a rule showed small losses.
Dealings In bonds were small, but prices j
were well held. Total sales, par value, $1,795,- [ '.

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. June 21.â Commercial Ad
vertiser's London cablegram says:
The markets here were disturbed to-day by
flatness in Paris. They hardened finally on a

Spanish fours were 60%@G1%. Tintos, 41%Â®43.
Consols fell to 107 11-16. closing at 107 15-16,
the lowest price this year. This is due to
dear money fears and the suspension of sink

the afternoon by buying New York Central,

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, June 21.â Any hope among wheat
traders that yesterday's late steadiness was the
beginning of a reaction was dissipated before
the opening by ports of much-needed rains
in Russia, improved crop prospects in that
country and an early decline of %d In Liver
pool cables. The effect of this news on specu
lators was partly nullified at first by rain in
the Northwest, where too much moisture has
already put the wheat fields perilously near
the danger line, and after about fifteen minutes
of weakness the market developed strength on
covering by shorts. Opening sales of September
were made at 76^@76%c, compared with yes
terday's closing price of 78% c, and the liqui
dation that started at once carried the price
liown to 7- ,c. On this early break the South
west was a heavy seller, owing to the receipts
of new wheat. Covering by shorts, who saw
danger In the Northwest rains, carried tin
September price back to 76% c. but before 11
o'clock the market again developed extremo
weakness, and from that time until within a
few minutes of the close selling was persistent
and heavy. There was only a moderate cash
demand, while the seaboard reported light busi
ness with the other side, only 22 loads being
taken for export late in the day. Late in the
session, however, the depression was checked by
reports of continued heavy rains in the North
west and by some unfavorable advices from
Kansas. Late Russian advices were not so
favorable, but traders hail apparently lost their
Interest in the foreign situation and had turned
their attention to the domestic crop. Septem
ber declined to 75 1 ,i.fi 7">*se, but enough support
materialized in the last hour to cause a reac
tion to 76@76%c, where it closed.
Corn rympathized with wheat to some extent,
but the narrowness of trading prevented any
material decline. September closed a shade
lower.
Oats were dull but fairly steady. September
felt in a decree the weakness of wheat and |
closed a shade lower.
Provisions were almost at a standstill There
was a little selling; by grain people, but no
pressure from packers. At the close September
pork was unchanged, lard a shade lower and
ribs a shade higher.

BOSTON WOOL MARKET.
BOSTON, June 21â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow: The
wool market is stronger and more active. The
buying is broadening and Is participated In by
manufacturers, large and small, the specula
tors, traders and exporters. Foreigners are
a -a in in the market and have looked at some
lar^e lines of wool, including territories, and
it is understood, have purchased some at this
writing and are negotiating for others. The
demand continues to be plenty for territory
wools, nearly :).4^0.0C0 pounds having changed
hands. The country markets are stilf excited
and many of the largest and best lots of wool
in the interior have been corralled. Buyers
are "lining up" In Montana and there is every
indication that there will be a lively scramble
for the good clips and that every high prices
will have to be paid. The sales for the week
in Boston amounted to 5.500,400 pounds domestic
and 1.104.000 pounds foreign, making a total
of 6,604,400 pounds, against a ti.tal of 4,974.600
pounds for the previous week and 753,600 pounds
for the corresponding week last year. Sales
since January 1. 1599, amount to 118.524,200
pounds, against 53,643,810 pounds last year at
this time.

HAY AND FEEDSTUFFS.
The circular of Somera <fc Co. says of Hay:
"Although we are fairly well along into the
new season, yet matters continue very quiet,
and for some unaccountable reason the usual
June activity seems to be lacking. It is true,
however, that the Fourth of July is a turning
point with many consumers who refuse to buy
new crop hay previous to that date. Ship
ments of new hay have been quite free for sev
eral days past, and everything arriving now
seems to be in good condition. Judging from
what new hay has already arrived and from
reports received from many sections we are
convinced that the new crop is of very good
quality. Most of the new hay seems to be
quite fret from any foul matter, of just about
the right growth and of good color. These
facts alone should help establish a healthy
market here, although we can do nothing with
hay without a demand. The hay crop is a
heavy one throughout the country tributary to
San Francisco, and if our local market can
consume no more than last year we fear for
the future of the market. We learn however,
that the crops are very light down South, and
If they will hut. draw from the San Francisco
market it may help materially in establishing
fair prices later on. There Is a scarcity of
alfalfa at the present time and a fairly active
demand for same, therefore for new crop we
are able to quott; from $5 50 to $7 per ton. New
wheat hay, choice qualtiy, will bring about $10,
while the various good qualities of both wheat
and wheat and oat bring from $N to f.9. New
oat hay and certain qualities of wheat and
oat, more particularly the fine, short wire
bound goods, bring from $7 to $S. The prefer
ence is still given for old crop, although in
about two weeks' time we will see b<t little
discrimination. We are incline to believe, that
by that time consumers will b.> prepared to buy
largely of the new hay, which will enable the
market to run on a fairly steady basla."

FARE iÂ« Â»0.CHILD KIDNAPED BY
A MAN OF MYSTERY
Its Grandmother Ran Four Miies
and Rescued It.
'iucky Mrs. Wittholl's Thrilling Story of
Struggle for Life in an Alameda
Shanty-The Abductor Arrested.
HAKLAND, the Hatchery of the Unexpected, furnished another
** mystery yesterday. A woman told the Chief of Police a
\ story of the abduction of a two-year-old boy that nas more
romantic than the oruinary fairy tale. After grabbing the child
1 the abductor drove off, and the woman, though 50 years old,
foiloweo him for four miles. The chase ended near the tidal
canal bridge, and when the abductor and his captive went into a
* secluded shanty the grandmother followed. The door was
ocked and she and the baby were kept prisoners for an hour,
% auring which time the abductor frequently threatened to kill her
? with a large knife. Watching her opportunity, she rushed out
k Hithjhe child and made her escape. Up to a late hour last
6 night the police had proved the truth of the grandmother's re
-9 markable story, and two officers were on guard all night watch
Â£ ing for the abductor's return. At 2 o'clock this morning he was
> arrested.
The woman is positive that the abductor was either drunk
* or crazy. There is now a belief that the man who stole the
* chiio is the same who attacked H. K. Belden with an ax at
* midnight two weeks ago.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, ,
908 Broadway, June 21. ;
A remarkable story of abduction of a
two-year-old child was told to-day to
Chief of Police Fletcher by Mrs. M. Witt
holl and her daughter, Mrs. F. McGulre,
who live at 1421 Seventeenth street.
The acts of which the ladies told could |
only have been those of a madman, and
Chief Fletcher believes that no other
theory can possibly explain the remark
able incident.
August Walter is a grandson of Mrs.
Wlttholl and a nephew of Mrs. McGulre.
Mrs. Wittholl and the child were on the
â  beach at West Oakland yesterday after-
Tfnoon gathering shells for the chickens.
At Sixteenth and Wood streets they met
an unknown man in a buggy. He said
something in Knglish which Mrs. W'.tt
ho'il did not understand, as she is Ger
man and speaks English very imperfectly.
After a little conversation the man seized
the little grandson by the arm, placed
him in the buggy and drove off.
"The man seemed enraged that I did
not understand him," said Mrs. Wittholl,
"and he seized the child and was driving
away before 1 really knew what had.hap
pened. I followed the buggy and never
lost sight of it. After running what
seemed to me many miles the man turned
Into an open gateway on some street. lie
hitched his horse and carried the baby
Into the house. I was not far behind and
followed through the open door. 1 met
the nan lace to face, and when he saw
nit! is anger seemed to increase, He
grabbed a large knife and threatened to
kill me if 1 made any disturbance. He
went out of doors, where there was some
!:'<i;-e, and as ton as he was outside the
house 1 picked up the baby and ran from
the place before be returned. 1 could run
faster than he could, and got away. I !
do not know where we went, as 1 have
been here less than a year from St. Louis
and am not acquainted with the streets.
i am sure, however, that we crossed over
one bridge."
Mrs. Wittholl said she could easily iden.
tlfy â¢â â¢ man, as she was in the house
with him for over an hour. He is aoout
55 years of age and very broad-shoul
<!<>rp<i standing about 5 feet 6 inches tall.
â The child is the Bon of Mr. and Mrs.
Eugene Walter, who came here from St.
Louis. Walter is a member of the Hos
pital Corps and 1.- now located at the
Presidio. Mrs. Walter lives with Mrs.
Wlttholl and little August is their only
child.
Although the detectives arc convinced
â  i" the truth of Mrs. Wittholl's story, there
are many remarkable features to it. Mrs.
Wittholl says that she followed the buggy
from Sixteenth and Wood streets, which
is almost at the bay shore in West Oak
land, to an old house in Alaiheda, near
the tidal canal. This Is a distance of
nearly four miles, and .Mrs. Wittholl was
kept about two blocks behind the buggy
all the way. She Is about 50 years old, and
yet she was able, after having a struggle
/or her life, to pick up the child and run
away with it. All this happened between
10 o'clock in the morning and 3 in the
afternoon, and yet nobody saw it or was
nsked by the woman to render her as
sistance
Detectives Quigley and Holland, taking
their clew from the fact that the woman
said she followed the buggy across a
bridge, started out with Mrs. Wittholl to
follow the track she thought she had
followed. She led the way toward the
tidal canal bridge that connects Alameda
and Oakland. when just across the bridge
Mrs. Wittholl saw a shanty partly hidden
by trees, and she at once Informed the
detective's that it was the place where
Bhe had been held a prisoner for fully an
hour by the man who had abducted the
child. "Mrs. Wittholl was very positive
and described the Interior of the place
ivith .great detail. After the detectives

woman had described. The knife with

in the event of her crying out was also
In the shanty.
"This Is a peculiar story," said Detec
tive Holland to-night, ""but although
there is much that seems mysterious
about It, 1 urn inclined to think that the
child was actually abducted. The wo
man s story has been verified in every
particular where verification is possible,
and there is no doubt that she was in

she showed us the chair where she sat

that there is no motive of which they
can conceive that would cause any one
to wish to abduct their little boy. The
woman had no difficulty in finding the
house and the fellow who has lived there
for some time has disappeared. His tools
are lying around and it is very evident
that he left In a hurry. We expect him
to return and his explanation of the whole

FIRED TWICE TO STOP
A FLEEING MAN
OFFICER SCOTT'S CHASE AFTER
A COLORED SOLDIER.
An Exciting Pursuit Near the Pre
sidio That Nearly Had a
Fatal Ending.
A member of the Twenty-fourth Tnfan
try. stationed at the Presidio, is thank
ful that his body is not perforated with
a bullet from the revolver of Officer Scott
of the North End station. On Tuesday
night the policeman lired'twice at the sol
dier, who was making frantic efftvrts to
avoid arr.-st, and this he succeeded in
doing by climbing over the Presidio fence
with greater force than ceremony, the
flight being hastened by the uncomfort
able hum of the leaden missile alined at
him.
1 hat the man was not killed is due to
his good fortune and not to the lack of
shooting ability (jf Officer Scott, who in
looked upon as one of the best shots on
the force. Shortly before the exciting
incideni a woman rushed up to the police
man and appealed for protection. She
breathlessly Informed him that a color. 1
man had instilled her while she was
walking along the street, and when she
remonstrated with him he picked up a
brick and struck her in the face, Indict
ing a severe wound. Her statement was
attest..! by the blood oozing out of a
deep gash on her cheek, and the officer,
quickly learning which way her assail
ant went, hurried in pursr.it. The un
known soldier, seeing the policeman,
broke into a run, and Snort started after
him. After repeatedly calling to him to
surrender, Scotr pulled out his revolver
and shot in the air to frighten his man,
but the report only had a tendency to in
crease his Bpeed. The pursued and pur
suer were close to the Presidio gate, but
this only redoubled Scott's desire to cap
ture his* man and he tired again with a
deliberate intention of winging him. But
for the darkness he might have suc
ceeded. As it was the negro went pell
mell over the fence into the arms of the
sentry, who was aroused by the shooting.
Scott, finding himself defeated, hurried
back to the spot where he left the
woman, but was disappointed, as she had
[eft Ib- tii.'d a report with Chief of Po
lice Lees last night in which he narrated
the above facts. The woman who was as
saulted by the soldier visited headquar
ters last night and gave her version of the
affair to the olerk in charge. She ex
pressed a desire that her name be not
mentioned in the affair, as ?he disliked
notoriety. A formal charge will be
lodged with the military authorities to
day with a view of having the soldier
punished for his action. It is understood
he was intoxicated at the time he did it
unii i<s roadv to make amends for it.

LAID ASIDE THEIR
PUNCHES FOR PLEASURE
CONDUCTORS ENJOYED A MUCH
NEEDED OUTING.
An Ideal Day and a Picked Crowd
Made Their Initial Picnic a Bril
liant Success â Who Were
Present.
There was a dearth of railway conduc
tors on the various divisions of this State
yesterday. Every ticket puncher who
could get away from his duties without
danger of tying up his line gathered his
family and capacious lunch basket to
gether and hied himself to Sunset Park
to attend the initial outing- of the mem
bers of his calling: given under the aus
pices of El Capitan Division No. 115. The
Knights of the Punch sat back in up
holstered cars, through which it is their
wont to pass in the collection of paste
boards, and calmly handed their printed
slips to' one of their tribe, and half pitied
the latter fur being compelled to work
on such an auspicious day.
If there was ever a success achieved
by an organization on its first venture
in the picnic line, the railroad conductors
are entitled to their share of the laurels.
Their picnic proved one of the most de
lightful held in Sunset Park, or, in fact,
any other park, in some moons. A per
fect day, a select crowd and not a hitch
in the arrangements made the outing a
memorable one.
Representatives from the surrounding
bay cities were there in numbers, garbed
in their coolest apparel, laden with the
good things that make a picnic pleasant
and without a care but to have a good
time. And they had it. too. If a crowded
dance hall is a criterion and if beaming
faces and merry laughter in other por
tions of the beautiful park are signifi
cant.
Fourteen cars carried the conductors,
their families and their numerous friends
to the mountains. A start was made at
8:45 a. m., and the heavily loaded train
stopped at rarious points along the route
to take on more. Near Mount Eden the
cylinder blew out of the locomotive and
caused a trifling delay. With a series of
jerks and jolts the engine was started
and hurried on to San Jose without fur
ther mishap, but there gave way to an
undamaged locomotive. The picnickers
arrived at Sunset Park shortly after noon
and immediately spread themselves about
the grounds and feasted on the good
things stored In their capacious hampers.
After, luncheon dancing was inaugurated,
and until 5 o'clock Richardson's Sausa
lito band discoursed popular music for
the graceful ones. Strolls down by the
babbling brook that courses through the
grounds were taken by numerous parties
and along its banks were children and
grown people dangling their "Trilbies"
in its cool current.
Among the familiar faces in and around
the dance hall during the day's festivities
were genial Sam Davis, one of the nar
row gauge's oldest conductors; C. D.
Phelps, A. R. Murray, J. D. Moffltt. J. C.
Frelling, George ]Â Colegrove, W. D.
Hartley. A. H. Hoibrook and W. H. Eng
wicht, of the Southern Pacific Company;
W. J. Hunter and J. K. Smith of the Cali
fornia and Northwestern.
W. J. Hunter made an efficient floor
manager and the other members of the
committee of arrangements, consisting of
Thomas Billingslea, Charles D. Phelps, J.
E. Dillon, Oeorgr L. Colegrove and
George K. Smith, also did valiant service
in making the affair a brilliant success.
An instance of the thoroughness In
which the railroad men conducted their
outing was shown on tho return journey,
when it was learned by telegraph that
twenty-three picnickers were left on the
grounds, through no fault of the com
mittee, but due to the twenty-three being
in the canyon when the signal was given
to depart. Without a minute's, hesitation
the committee ordered a special end: 1 ,"
and car to the park and the belated pic
nickers were whirled hr>me In style. Such
courtesy won further words "f aj>>proval
for the conductors and was a fitting close
to a jolly outing.

sessed the San Francisco
National Bank.
The San Francisco National Bank filed
a bill of injunction against Assessor
Dodge yesterday in the T'nited States
Circuit Court to restrain the Assessor
from seizing and selling the personal
property of the bank for $S4'?o I,~> taxes al-
â  leged to be due on its personal property,
stock, etc.
The allegation is made that the tax levy
has been illegally made, and that thp as
sessment to the bank of the shares of

greater rate than is assessed upon other
moneyed capital in the hands of Indi
â  vidual citizens of the Plate of Califor
nia. The l.iiiik furthermore declares that
it has no means of knowing the names
I of its shareholders, for these may have
changed since they were first recorded
t and the further point is raised that the
. Assessor has not deduct.! from the aa
: sessed valuation of the shares, debts un
! secured by trust deed, mortgage or other
i liens owing by the shareholders to bona
j lide residents of the State of California.

Debts Incurred in Violation of the
One-Twelfth Act in Jeopardy.
The Auditor will hold a conference
with the Finance Committee of the
Board of Supervisors in a few days In
regard to the payment of certain claims
that have been incurred in violation of

The former board left bills unpaid to
the amount of $20,773 04, including street
labor claims for the month of December
last, which have heen Ignored on the
ground that they were hot Incurred by
the presr-nt administration. Since Janu
ary 1 b'lls amounting to $122,300 have been
incurred and remain unpaid. If these are
not liquidated before the 30th lnst., un
der the provisions of the law they be
come void.

.Antone Meyers, a saloon-keeper at
Lombard nnd Baker streets, was arrested
yesterday by Detectives Ryan and ODea [
j on a charge of receiving- stolen property i
belonging to the Government. Meyers
hatl been in the habit of supplying liquor
j to soldiers from the Presidio and took as !
i payment articles of underwear and others !
I in payment which had been stolen by
! them.
The police were notified of the fact on
Monday, and Detectives Ryan and ODea
i were detailed on the case. Under their j
! instructions. Captain D. B. Devore swore â¢
I out a search warrant yesterday and, ac- !
i c-ompanied by the two detectives, went to
| Meyer's saloon. Meyers denied having any
of the property and asked them to search
his premises. They proceeded to do so
and when they hail reached h closet on
I the porch Meyers pot scared and fled, but
] was quickly overtaken by Ryan and held
I p'-ndinvr an investigation of the closet.
In the closet was found a miscellaneous ;
collection of stolen articles, all bearing: j

! blankets. L' 2 dark blue shirts, S cotton un- |
dershirts, 1 Red Cross band, 6 pairs white

OIL COMPANY BLAMED
FOR HOLBROOK'S DEATH
BUSINESS MEN RENDER A VER-
DICT OF CENSURE.
Tanks Should Not Be Tapped After
Dark When Lamplight Was
Necessarily Obliged to
Be Used.
An inquest was held yesterday morn
ing by Coroner Hill on the body of
Charles Hoibrook, who came to his death
last Tuesday morning from injuries re
ceived by an explosion of coal oil in the
i works of the Union Oil Company. The
| Jury, composed of business men, censured
the oil company and also the draylng
company for which Hoibrook had been
working.
The testimony on behalf of the oil com
pany was that Hoibrook called at Ihe
works for a load of oil after dark, and !
that the man in charge of the works tit
that hour had his pood clothes on, and
mentioned that fact to Hoibrook. who i
volunteered to fill the package himself, i
He was given a lantern, which he set by'
the Bide of the tank. Some of the oil
bubbled and sputtered upon the lantorn,
settiriK fire to Hoibrook and the tank.
The agents of the company contende-i
at the inquest that it was no part of Hoi
brook's duty to decant the oil. and taat
he alone was to blame, he having volun
teered his services. It appeared. a!.-v>,
that the oil company did not employ a
watchman. The jury returned a verdict
as follows:
That the said Charles Holbrook, a*ed 47.
nativity Massachusetts, occupation teamster,
resilience 334.3 Twenty-fourth street, in the city
anil county of San Francisco, came to his
death at the City Receiving Hospital In said
city and county on the 20th day of June, IK'.t9,
from ihock following burns; and we do further
find the Union Oil Company criminally negli
gent In so far as to allow oil to be taken from
Its premises at a time when lamplight had
to be used. And we further find the Bocarde
Drayage Company negligent In allowing its
teamster to perform the duty that caused his
death.
The following named composed the
jury:
V. H. Coward. 217 Sacramento street;
William Richards. 2nfi Sacramento street;
\V. W. Barton. 212 Sacramento street; J.
<;. Libby. 219 Sacramento street; E. M.
Batchelder, 22S Front street; George New
bauer, L'2ti Front street; W. N. Mack. 213

The meeting of the Socialist Labor

1 police arid the members of the party com
plain bitterly of the way in which it was

brutality anil that language unfit for
| repetition was used. The speaker was
Arthur McQinty; he was taken to the
; Centra] Station and locked up on a charge
of obstructing the sidewalk. When tne
I organizer of the party, Thomas Beres
ford, produced $2n bail, The customary
amount in such cases, he was told the

Lumbermen Organize.
A mass-meetingr of lumbermen was held
in the hall of the Coast Seamen's Union

HENRY T .OXNARD
SAYS HAVEMEYER
MISSTATES FACTS
Answers the Sugar
Trust Magnate.
FALSE ATTACK ON THE TARIFF
WOULD DESTROY THE BEET
SUGAR INDUSTRY.
Says the Big Organization Is Seeking
to Divert Attention From Its Re
fining of Foreign Raw
Material.
Hpnry T. Oxnard, president of the
American Beet Sugar Producers' Asso
ciation, has prepared a reply to H. O.
Havemeyer'a recent argument before
the Industrial Commission, in which he
flatly contradicts many of Mr. Hav< -
meyer's statements and accuses that
gentleman of seeking; to destroy th-
American beet sugar industry in order
to foster the refineries that handle for
eign raw material, besides attempting
to divert public attention from the su
c-ar trust by attacking the tariff. His
statement In full is as follows:
In Justice to tin heir," sugar producers,
and as president of the American Beel
Sugar Producers' Association, ] wish to
â  hII attention to a few of the Inaccura
cies In H. O. Havemeyer's recent and
wonderfully fallacious argument i
the industrial Commission at Y\ ashing-
Mr Havemeyer makes claims which
not in any way substantiate. A fair
sample of his illogical argumeni is found
in the first line, which forms the basis
of his whole argument, viz.: "The cus
toms tariff is the mother of all trusts."
Mr. Havemeyer says that the tariff is
responsible for all larg< trusts, because
they are inordinately protected, except â 
the sugar trust. The two largest, in fact
er trusts in this country, as
every one knows, are th< Standard Oil
and sugar trusts. The Standard oil Com
pany doea not enjoy Its monopoly from
tlic "tariff, and the American Sugar Re
fining Company, according to Mr. Have
: receiv< s onlj â "'â¢;â  per i ent protec
tion. How absurd, tht>n. is it to say that
the tariff is responsible for trusts. But;
right here T wish to dispute Mr. Have- j
c statement regarding the protec
tion afforded to sugar refining, claiming
that it only receives a protection of :â 'â 'â¢ 2 :
iâ¢ :â  cent, in the Dingley tariff act sugar
refining receives a protection of an eighth I
of a cent per pound, and the testimony
produced before the Ways and Means
Committee, of which Mr. Dingley was
< hairman, brought out the fact that su
ic;;'.- in a modern refinery, wyh the best
machinery, well located, can lit- refined
ost of about a quarter of a cent per
We therefore find that sugar re
fining under those conditions is receiving
protection of not ;!'-. but . : ' :i per cent
ad valorem, basert on the o>st of refining
-Micar. The error in Mr. Havemeyer's
argument is that he arrives at the pro
tectlon to sugar refining based on the
value of refined sugar. In other words. :
basing the value at 3 cents per pound
and receiving a protection of only l.'j
< 'â nts. Mr. Havemeyer would be right in
saying that he receives only a protection
of approximately 4 per cent; but Mr.
Havemeyer does not produce the sugar. ]
and his only interest is in the cost of
making raw sugar white, or. in other
words, refining raw brown sugar, and his
â¢ion must I>.; based on what the
< opt is of refining instead of the vaJu
the sugar which brings his protection
from 4 p^r cent up to 10 or 50 per cent.
The protection granted the sugar pro
rs who make the article of sugar
itself is 50 per cent on the cost of raw
sugars to-day, or identical with the pro
tion granted the sugar refining com
panies.
Should Mr. Havemeypr's selfish sugges
tions be adopted it would wipe out en
tirely the American home sugar industry
and all.'W Mr. Havemeyer to continue re
lining foreign raw sugars.
We must look to the reasons which led
Mr. Havemeyer to make this wonderful
and fallacious attack on home sugar pro
duction. In tii*' tirst place, he knows per
fectly well, aiT 1 can read the handwriting
on the wall, which says that the. produc
tion of sugar from sugar beets carried out
on the lines on which the industry is
I. pine developed in the United States will
finally result in producing the sugar con- ,
sumed by the people of thr- United States >
in a thousand beet sugar factories dotted |
all over the Union and render useless the
refineries on the coast. These factories
will employ a hundred m^n where one is
employed to-day by the sugar trust and
givf> the farmers the benefit of a protec
tive tariff on a new and profitable crop,
which is a desirable end to he obtained
for the agricultural classes, who art
usually benefited by any tariff protect
Mr. Havemeyer, a.s president of the
American Sugar Refining Company, !.s ]
perfectly right to do everything in his |
pnwr to protect thr industry he repre
sents, and his suggestion that raw sugars
âwhich -ato his raw materialâ should be
let in duty free is undoubtedly on the lines
most favorable to the sugar trust.
He suggests that sugar be admitted
duty free from Cuba, knowing full well j
that this would at the present tim^ pre- ;
vent the development of the home beet
sugar industry, which is a new industry |
in this country, only having had a prac- i
tical existence since the McKinley act, |
but a most promising one. and one which !
will, if fostered during the next ten or
fifteen years, supply the United States j
with their own sugar instead of sending ;

HENRY T. OXNARD, Who Champions the Beet Sugar Industry
ROBBED MAIL BOXES
FOR AN EASY LIVING
Eugene Franks Boldly Admits
That for Years He Has
Followed This Practice.
EUGENE FRANKS, "â¢>â  - was arrested Tuesday night by Detectives
Dinan and Reynolds, on Bush street, for stealing packages from the
top of .mail boxes, will have to answer to four charges of petty lar
ceny. The postal authorities cannot prosecute him, as the packages were
:iot within the mail boxes.
Franks is a man "2 years cf age and is one of the class Imbued with
the idea that it is undignified to w<;rk for a living as long as it can be done
by stealing. For several years he has made it a practice to steal packages
from the top of mall boxes, and ha* lived by pawning the articles contained
in the stolen packages. About two years ago the postal authorities received
complaints that packages martod had not reached their destinations, and
iho police were notified. Dinan ftÃd Reynolds were at that time detailed on
the case, and they arrested Fi"Â»nks in the commission of the offense. He
was sentenced to six months in the County Jail.
Recently complaints were again received by the postal authorities and the
police were again notified. Dtnan and Reynolds suspected Franks, and they
shadowed him and succeeded in arresting him Wednesday night, while he
was in the act of taking packages from the top of a mail box on Bush
street. Yesterday they went to his room in a lodging-house on Bush street
and Becused a large number of packages that had been stolen and opened.
They were taken to the City Prison, and Postal Inspector Erwln was notified
and obtained a list of the addresses on the packages.
Franks was seen in the City Prison yesterday and frankly admitted that
he stole the packages, and was willing to assist the police and postal authori
ties in recovering the articles he had stolen from the packages and pawned.
He said he had no excuse to offer 'or his conduct, only that it Mas an easy
way to get a living.
The fault of leaving men like Franks open to the temptation of stealing
these packages does not lie with the postal authorities, but with boys em
ployed in stores, as a rule. They are ordered by tYieir employers to post tho
packages in the general postoffice or one of the branch offices, but instead of
doing so place them on top of the nearest mail bo* -and leave them openly
there to be removed by any one who has a desire ti> do so.
tack on the tariff in general, and the
home sugar industry in particular, may
be accounted for by his desire to dlrsct
the attention away from trusts and have
it centered on the tariff. The experiences
of depression following the Wilson act,
contrasted with the prosperity which BUC
ceeded the McKinley law, will hardly fool
the majority of the American people. Mr.
Havemeyer and others having selfish in
u-r.-sis to protect notwithstanding. Mr.
Havemeyer wants raw sugar free, and
favors Cuban planters against American
farmers. This might be an additional rea
son for his suggestion that Cuban sugar
should be admitted free, but the main
and, in my opinion, underlying reason for
his statement rests on the fact that he
sees the final destruction of the sugar re

There is no trust among the sugar pro
ducers of this country, and there never
can be, for the simple reason that the
beet sugar industry can be started in al
most any part of tlif Union.
I conclude by calling attention to the
fact that the home sugar Industry, which
Mr. Havemeyer claims to bo inordinately
protected, is not in a trust, whereas the
sugar refining industry, which he claims
does not receive oni-half of the protec
tion it requires. Is, -vfith the Standard Oil
Company, the pioneer of this new busi

MANY MERRYMAKERS
AT SHELL MOUND PARK
STAR OF THE SEA CHURCH
GIVES A PICNIC.
Father Coyle's Parishioners Have a
Jolly Timeâ Fat Men's Race
Excites Unusual Interest.
The sixth annual picnic of the Star of
the Sea Parish at Shell Mound Park yes
terday was a grand success. Over 1000
' merrymakers journeyed across the bay to
the pleasure grounds, and there was not
one unpleasant incident to mar the enjoy
ment of the occasion.
It was a family picnic, and there wero
I many little ones present who were made
i happy by all kinds of amusements. There
were baskets of good things in profusion,
and after full iustice had been done to
| them dancing:, under the direction of
Musician Blanchard, was enjoyed.
At 2 o'clock the racing events, for valu
able prizes, were carried out under the
personal direction of Rev. Father J. P.
Coyle, pastor of the church. The fat
men's race excited the most interest.
There were four contestants: Officer Hen
ry Pyle, 210 pounds; Customs Inspector W.
P. Johnson, 209; Insurance Agent Harry
Kelly. 180, and Capitalist "Billy" Curttn,
185. In the vernacular, "there was noth- I
ing to it," for Johnson led all the- way and
came in laughing, with Pyle a good sec
ond. Kelly looked as if he had walked
around the track, and Curtin was "abso
lutely last."

GREAT DEMAND
FOR LABORERS
IN THE COUNTRY
Good Wages Offered
for Willing Help.
CHINESE FILLING THE PLACES
MANY ORDERS GIVEN TO CITY
EMPLOYMENT OFFICES.
Strange Situation Presented by Those
Who Would Toil and Those in
Need of Harvest
Hands.
Men walking the streets of the city beg
ging for an opportunity to work or ths
price of a meal and a place to sleep.
Farmers frantic over the prospect of los
ing their crops, representing time, labor
and money expended, because help is
scarceâ almost impossible to secure at any
price.
Such is the peculiar condition of the la
bor market to-day. The laws of supply
and demand seem to have slipped a cog,
thereby stopping the machinery which
moves the prosperity of the State. A
number of prominent land owners holding
properties in several parts of California
have been obliged to send to the city for
Chinese and Japanese help to harvest
their crops because they were unable to
get white men at any reasonable price.
One of them yesterday in discussing the
situation stated that never in his recollec
tion has there been such a scarcity of
workir.gmen in the country as at the pres
ent time. From San Diego to the far
north the same complaint has been made,
and to-day hundreds of orders for work
lngmen are on the books of the employ
ment offices in this city. F. W. Zeile,
president of the Mercantile Trust Com
pany, had his attention called to the situ
ation, and in discussing the subject yes
terday said: "Within the last few weeks
1 have met a number of landowners from
all parts of the State, and they are com
plaining bitterly because they are unable
to secure help to get in their crops. These
farmers do not represent any particular
locality, but come from the Sacramento
and San Joanuin valleys, from the Salinas
and the Santa Clara districts.
"In the big valleys there is hay and
grain to harvest, and in the smaller \ al
leys the orchardists are beginning to feel
the necessity of having a few additional
men to help handle the fruit crop. From
what 1 caji learn, all kinds of good wages
are offered. The common hay and
handler can get from SI 25 to $2 50 per day
and found. The more expert harvesters
can earn more. Order after order has
been sent to the employment offices here,
and still they remain unfilled. There has
been some talk to the effect that the ia
boring men in the city have not the means
to reach tho farms and that is what is
keeping them from going into the country.
Whatever may be the reason, the fact re
mains the same â the farmers are sadly in
need of help and hundreds of irile men are
to be seen around the city every day ask
ing for work."
Inquiry proves that the lack of means to
get to* the places where work is to be ob
tained is not the reason for the idle men
remaining in the cities. It has always
been the custom for the employer to ad
vance the necessary money for the sturdy
worker to get to the country, the amount
of his f.-re bNng dfduetod from the first
money he earns. Whatever may be tine
reason for the worker and tho farmer not
coming together, the fact remains the
sampâ there is plenty of work to be had
In the. country and the farmers are
ohl'gc d to fill th^ places of vrhlte men with
Asiatics. It has been stated that at the
present time the country is overrun with
men seeking work. A reputable gentle
man owning several farms in various
parts of the State asserted that nearly all
who have comn to his places are. nothing
but tramps, who are thoroughly unrelia
ble and worso than useless in any work
at which they can be put. These are the
fellows who are believed to be responstnl*
for keeping many worthy men away from
the country by spreading the statement
that work Is scarce; and "wages low. The
"hobo" is worthless at any price.

C.P.HUNTINGTON'S
FIST CLOSED IN
PALTRY GREED
The Magnate Dislikes
Californians.
AND DISPLAYS PETTY GRUDGE
HE ATTEMPTS TO SQUEEZE THE
OLYMPIC CLUB.
He Is the Only Bondholder Who Re
fuses to Remit the Interest on
His Investment for a
Short Time.
C. P. Huntlngton has given another
Btriking exhibition of his extreme par-
Fimcmy and utter lack of public spirit.
For the sake of a niggardly income of
$250 a year for five years he has earned
the contempt of the Olympic t'lub and
its well wishers. Fortunately the rail
road magnate has done no harm to the
splendid organization, which Is now the
oldest athletic club In the world and
one of the most famous. That no harm
was done is, however, no credit to Mr.
Huntlngton. He did the club all the In
jury in his power and deliberately ac
cepted the proposition that it might go
â¢ ace before he would con
â  to sacrifice his paltry interest on
t "lymplc Â«'!ub bonds. This is another
example of his treatment of idti and
institutions, which explains the opinion
of Californians in reference to him.
He now occupies the unenviable posi
tion C'f being the only Olympic t'lub
bondholder who stood In defiance of the
measure intended to save the club. All
the other bondholders, large and
small, some holding nine times as many
.bonds as Huntingdon and others nine
times less, agreed gladly tv do as they
were ask. d. It will be remembered
that in 1892 the Olympic Club issued
bonds to the value of $"-'25,000, the bonds
bearing interest at 5 per cent. The club
i Itself able to pay interest upon
its obligation up to June, ISSS.
en the interest fell into arrears and
the club now <nves its bondholders
about (12,000. Affairs were not the
brightest under these conditions, and
an agreement \\ ;i s made that if two
thirds of the bondholders were willing
the interest would be remitted for tiv>
lining with June, jv<v A pe
ri was circulated and the bondhold
ers were asked i<> sign it. Mis. Stan
ford not only agreed i<< sacrifice the
interest which v, ;-.s due tv her and will
ue, but ordered all her bonds can
.. thus making the club a n<
gut of $5000.
.J"h!i \Y. Mackay owns $25,000 in
Olympic Club bonds and did not know
the fan until lie was ask'-d to give up
the ii â  five y^:<rs. He readily
1 t<> il" so. The following bond
holders, with the amounts representing
tli' i i- holdings, ha-" agreed tv do the
James 1.. Flood, $20,000; H. M.
Newhall <v Co., $5000; A. \V. roster,
$6000; T. Hopkins, $5250; .1. UcDonough,
. ';â¢ â â¢ -â  ' 'rocker, $5000; Fireman's
Fund Insurance Company, $5000; I>. â¢ >.
.Miils. $5000; \Y. '>!'.. Macdonough, $5000;
Anglo-Californian Hank. $3000; J. Ro
senfeld & Son, $2000; Russ family. JllT.'.';
M. H. de Young, $1500.
All of these bondholders agreed to re
lnit the interest and then C. P. Hunt
infrtnn, who <.\\ns (5000 in bonds, was
;(skÂ»-(l to do tli" same. He refused. He
was told how necessary it la for the
club to receive the assistance which
â was demanded, but Mr. Eiuntington
The i lub could go out ut
existence before he would give up hia
â¢rable $250 a year. H<- declared that
he saw no reason why he should assist
any of the institutions in a communltj
â¢ here he is disliked. Besides ii Is a
business transaction and business is
The club must satisfy its ob-
Mr. Eiuntington. No amount
of pleading would prevail upon th<
mRn and the effort was given up in diS
gUSt.
Notwithstanding Huntington's mean
ness the Olympic Club will be saved.
]n a very few days it is expected thai
the necessary two-thirds <if the bond
holders will have Bigned th>ir names
and the Interest will h>- remitted. This
will mean a total saving of $60,000, or
$1000 a monthâ a tremendous Item in
the expenses of the club. The Fair
estate holds $45,000 in the bonds of th^
rub. but both Herman Oelrlchs and
Charles Fail- have promised to remit
the interest as Boon as the necessary
legal steps can be tak.-n. The execu
tors of the C. F. Crocker estate, which
lias ?]o. (Mm in bonds, have promised to
do the same and this assures more than
the necessary two-thirds. ]t should noi
be forgotten that scores of small hold
ers have signed and deserve fully as
much credit for their action as" the
h * ler holders.
With the remission of this enormous
pum in interest the Olympic Club will
begin a new era of prosperity which
every well-wisher of athletics will iiÂ»
glad to see. And Mr. Huntington prob
ably will invest his $250 so that it also
may earn interest.
Jloft cash will buy you a brand new
piano at Mauvais', 76!' Market street. *

STRANGE STORY
OF LUBELSKI'S
MISSING GEMS
Thief Tries to Get a
Reward.
'Ih" Lubelski diamonds have been
found. A man who Hid not steal them
has broken into prison in his efforts to
prove that ho knew all about a thief who
did. Honesty has been rewarded and an
other police mystery lias been cleared up.
The Lubelski gems disappeared last
Sunday afternoon in the most mysterious
fashion from thÂ»- Lubelski residence, 307
Golden Gate avenue. ThÂ»> lady of the
â  and her husb tnd were dressing pre
paratory to making a few calls. The dia
monds, a brooch and a pair of earrings,

Mrs. Lubelski from their case and plnced

MRS. BEX BUTLER. the Btatellest

Early in the morning the attaches of

called to the rocks by the unearthly
barkings of the dame. She k<'i>i them
up incessantly, and as this vociferous
ness was something entirely out of
line with the Conner conduct of "Mrs.
Ben," much curiosity was aroused. It
\\:is noticed that her barkings wen?
accompanied with convulsive jerkings

reached that i-he had been wounded :;:

and moaning low responses to the atf.i

Mr. "Wilkins and his employes ii; their
belief that some person or persons un
known were potting the seals of the
herd. H is suspected that the guilty
parties are Italian fishermen, who are
taking this means of killing off the
denizens of the rocks, who they

the fish. For several weeks it has been

looking for the gems. She hunted high

the Inexplicable myÃtery of the disappear

that her husband's coat was on the chair

Lubelski searched himself and his over

He heard nothing of it until yesterday,
when a colored man. who gave the name
of Charles Walker and claimed to be a

secure the return of the gems. lie said

doubtedly fell a victim to their aim,
although Seal Expert Moore says that
1 fie wounds on the presidential seal
were gained in a dispute with another
bachelor dubbed "Mark llanna," who
disputes the northernmost rock with
him.
Phil Bekeart, the well-known sports

several friends when he noticed a seal

he was willing to take Lubelski at once

The pawnbroker jumped at the chance,
took $100 from his safe to make the dicker

to find him.

the man wanted could be found. When

man could not pee It that way. He insist

sonally with "Reardon." Walker reluct
antly consented to this and walked his
companion several more blocks on the pre
tense of looking for the man with the
gems.
By this time Lubelski bad arrived at the
conclusion that "Reardon" was a myth.
He declined to hunt longer for him. and

Detective Graham arrived at the store a
few minutes later, and Lubelski Turned
over to him Walker and his story. The
colored man stuck to it, notwithstanding

off (-red to go with him on the search for

Walker, who was as good a traveler as

bacK with him to Lubelski's. Walker
made no demur and started. On the way
clown he expressed a desire for a drink
and stepped into a saloon to get it. In
stead of going to the bar, he walked to
a room in the rear. Witnout his knowl
edge, Graham was close after him. lust
In time to see him throw something in
a cesspool. The detective collared his
man and had the cesspool searched with
the result that several skeleton keys and
a glass cutter thrown away by the negro
were recovered. Walker was taken im
mediately to the City Prison, where he
was charged with vagrancy and carrying
burglar tools.
Lubelski, of course, was disappointed at
the failure of what he had considered a
good lead to his diamonds, and went home
in a poor frame of mind. A surprise
however, awaited him there, when his
wife announced that she had recovered
the lost jewelry. The pawnbroker was
dazed for a moment and thought his bet
ter half was joking. She soon convinced
him otherwise by displaying the treasure
trove.
The stones had been returned by Mrs.
E. Hachmnnn. who resides at 315 Golden
Gate avenue, a few doors from the Lu
belskis. Phe had come into possession of
them Sun. lav afternoon, her little boy
having told her that he had picked tlu-rh
up on the sidewalk. Mrs. Bachmann, not
bfing up on the value of jewelry, did not
think much of the earrings and brooch
and put them away in a bureau drawer.
She does not take a daily paper < r md did
not hear of the mysterious disappearance
of the Luhfiskl gems until yesterday
afternoon, about the time the pawn
broker was engaged in the wild goose
chase with Walker. A neighbor called
on her and told her of the mysterious'dis
appearance of the trinkets.
"Well," said Mrs. Bachmann, "T wonder
If they are not the things my little boy
picked up last Sunday?"
"That was the day they were lost," re
plied the neighbor, "maybe they are."
Mrs. Bachmann got the trinkets, hur
ried with them to the Lubolski residence,
where their owner identified her missing
gauds, told her story of her boy's find
and delivered the jewels to the pawn
broker's wife.
Lubelski was so tickled at the recital
and bo impressed with the romance at
tached to the disappearance, the goose
chase for and the recovery of the dia
monds, that he hurried over to the Bach

mother of the boy who had found the

ASSESSOR DODGE GETS
NAMES OF BANK CLERKS
HIBERNIA DIRECTORS GIVE LIST
OF EMPLOYES.
Officials of the Institution Conclude
That the Demands of the Doctor
Should Be Acceded to.
A truce has been railed and hostilities
suspended between the forces of Assessor
Dodge and the clerks employed in the
Hibernia Bank. The latter will pungle
two big silver dollars each, which the
Assessor demands as a poll tax, and the
charge of battery against the pugnacious
Mr. McGlynn will in all probability be
withdrawn.
The Assessor was very wroth over the
manner In which his deputies had been
treated by the bank clerks Tuesday, and
yesterday afternoon he again marshaled
his forces and led the attack on the rinan
; c-inl Institution In person. The bank of
flciala were expecting him, and the As
sessor was at once ushered into the dl
i rectors' room and pleasantly Informed
I that the directors at a meeting held in
j the forenoon had decided that the mimes
of the employes of the Institution should
; be furnished to the Assessor as requested.
i It was explained that there had never
been any desire upon the part of the re-
I sponsible officers of the Institution to
place obstacles in the way of the collec
tion of the poll tax, the whoie trouble
being due to the unwarranted eftkious
j ness of a subordinate- The Assessor then
i retired to bis oflioe, taking with him the
! coveted roll. He does not anticipate any
â  trouble in collecting the tax, as now that
ln> has the names he can collect from
the bank In case the clerks refuse to toe
the scratch.
Ass<*sor Dodge desires to correct the
statement that was made in "some of the
morning papers to the effect that Mr.
j Tobin ban refused on demand to givo a
i list and was therefore liable to arrest.
I This gentleman. Assessor Dodge states,
: was out oi' town and was not the official
on whom the demand was made, and the
statement that his arrest was ever con
templated was erroneous and does the
gentleman an injustice.
When the case of Charles J. McGlynn,
charged with assaulting Deputy Assessor
Pratt, was called in Judge Graham's
: (niirt yesterday the attorneys for the
i prosecution asked for a cf.ininuance until
( to-day, TMiiieh was granted. Assessor
! IÂ»odge intimated later that he would not
push the case .against the clerk.
