â¢ |\ 26. â Joseph Chamberlain, ;
â * Secretary oi State for the :
Colonies, addressing: the Union- :
','ists of this city thi* evening, re- ;
viewed carefully the Transvaal ;
question. In the course of his ;
speech he said that, owing: u~> the I '
enormous military preparations :
'of the Government of the South
African republic. Great Britain ;
had been compelled to increase
the British garrison in Cape Col
' ony and Xatal. entailing an ad- :
ditional expenditure of 500,000
pounds annual!} .
Mr. Chamberlain said the Gov
ernment had tried to establish
friendly relations with President
Kruger, but all advances had
been received with contempt. He
then proceeded to eulogize Sir';
Alfred Milner. Governor of Cape j
Colony and British High Com- i
missioner for South Africa.
After denouncing in the j
strongest terms the attitude and !
actions of the Boers, Mr. Cham-;
berlain with great deliberation j
and'-emphasis added:
"The Transvaal's enormous
secret service fund has procured
jt friends and advocates in every
country. The way tne British I
subject there is treated is not only 1
a menace to them all but inter
sSvith our prestige among the
s, who now regard the
rs and not the British as the
paramount power.
"Besides the breaches of the
London convention, the Trans- j
vaal is flagrantly violating the
equality that convention was in
tended to secure. Its misgovern
ment is a festering sore, poison- i
ing the whole atmosphere of
South Africa. The Dutch in Cape j
Colony and Xatal would be. in the
â¢ happiest condition, but so long as;
the disease of hatred and sus
picion prevails in the Transvaal
it is impossible to stop the con
tagion.
"Four times since independ
ence was granted we have been
on the verge of war with the
Transvaal. It is erroneous to say
'the British Government wants
war; but it is equally erroneous to
say the Government will draw
back, now that it has put its hand
:to the plow.
"'We hope the efforts that are
now being made will lead to an
amicable arrangement, for Great 1
Britain only desires justice, but
"there comes a time when patience
can hardly be distinguished from
weakness and when moral pres
sure |>ccomes a farce that cannot
be continued without loss of self
respect, i trust that time may
never nun. in this instance, but
if it does Britons will insist upon
â¢ the means to find a result essen
tial to the peace of South Africa."
The speech was warmly â¢ ap
plauded. . In reply to a vote of j
thanks, Mr. Chamberlain said he
felt strengthened and encouraged
by this confidence and support,
..He had spoken from the heart be
cause he believed they had
reached a critical turning point in
the history of the empire and that
the whole world was watching to
see how they would issue from
the difficulty.
"It is my belief," said he, in
closing, "that the country will
show itself not unworthy of its
glorious history and traditions." j

Anothei Dreyfusard meeting, organ
ized bj So lalists. was announced for
this evening In the Salle dv Treillis
h^re. Circulars had boon distributed
during the day calling upon the people
rest tn "defend their liberties pain- ]
ed at the expense of the four revolu- j
tions" ami to "prevent the supreme
shame to humanity of the condemna
tion of an innocent man."
The police took strinpent precautions
to prevent trouble. Detachments of
gendarmes were located in the houses,
in the vicinity of the hall, and the p gu
lar police, which wen also stationed
about the place, doubtless z:iv the pro
prietors of the ball a hint, because
when the organizers of the meeting ar
rived at the hall at 8:30 this evening
headed by a locjtl anarchist leader
named Brousseouloux the proprietor
withdrew permission for the meeting
and a hot altercation without result
ensued.
Finally Brousseouloux and his friends
declared th<ir Intention of creating a
demonstration In the streets and called
upon their supporters to follow them.
The Commissary of Police, who was
present at th^ altercation, Immediately
ordered forty gendarmes to cordon the
streets and cut off communication with
the center of the town. Brousseouloux
whs then kept outside. There was
much talk, but at that time there was i
no disorder.
An hour or bo later a crowd of pome
f>no made a long detour and flocked into
the town by another route. They wer<*
joined by all the loafers in Brest, an.l
overran the whole place, shouting "A
bas PArmee." "Vive Loubet," "Vive
Dreyfus" and "Vive la Social Revolu
tion." i
Such a demonstration had never been
h".-.r<l of before in Brest, whose popula- j
tion was at first thrown into a state
of consternation, but the thing soon be
came farcical. As soon as thÂ»- crowd j
met a few police, headed by a police j
commissary with the tricolor scarf i
around his waist, it dispersed and by
half-past 10 the streets were quite i
calm except for the ragamuffins singing j
the ".Marseillaise" and the "Car
magnole" out of the. hearing of the po- J
lice. The latter only arrested four, and I
t ] ir .<s* will probably be released to- j
night.
Brousseouloux disappeared at the j
first sign of a collision. The truth is
the anarchists and socialists are here
only to further thir own propaganda j
through the Dreyfus affair and thf>re is
little likelihood of serious trouble.

THE SECOND
C OU RT-MARTIAL
OF DREYFUS
KENNES, June 26.â The
stcord trial of Captain Alfrad
Dreyfus by couit-martial on
the charge of communicating
documents connected with ths
national defense to the agonts
of a foreign power, â will take
place in the army service
building here.
M. MLithieu Dreyfus, broth
er of the famous prisoner, has
arrived here.
session when it became known that two
hostile groups, the Socialist-RaoMcala
and the Democratic Left, had decide i
to vote in favor of the Government, and
that M. Paul de Cassaignac had with
drawn his interpellation.
Identical statements were read in |
the Chamber r>f Deputies by the Pre- '
mier, M. Waldeck-Rousseau, and in the i
Senate by the Minister of .Justice, M.
Munis. They were as follows:
"The Chamber of Deputies, in ex
pressing itself resolved not to support
any government but one determined to
defend energetically republican institu
tions and assure public order, has j
clearly defined the task imposed upon ,
the new Cabinet. The Ministry has no
other ambition than to accomplish it. ;
In order to bring about the pacifica
tion of the country and to maintain :
intact our common inheritance, it
s â¢ mcd to us that existing delusions
should be effaced and that the work
we are about to undertake required the i
co-operatipn of all Republicans. When
the aim is definite, though varying ac
cording to the methods of different
schools, accord becomes easier and con
troversies are lost in the presence of.
one duty to\ perform. To end the agl- \
tatlons pursued under disguises easy to
penetrate, against the regime which
iias been sanctioned and will be upheld
by universal suffrage and to require
from all the services, loyal assistance
and courageous assumption of respon
sibility BU( h is necessarily the first ;
dutj of the, Government. It is resolved
to have all judicial decisions respected,
and if the first wish of the country is !
to listen to the voice of justice it will ]
maintain silence and respect while its
decisions are prepared.
"In the front rank of the important
interests of the country, bound up with
the conservation of the dignity of the;
nation, we place the interests of the
army, which the Republic- has con- !
structed on a stronger and wider basis,
and which is synonymous with the
Republic's security and is the pride of
France. We think, with the army's most
Illustrious and surest guides, that in- |
violable attachment to discipline is the
first and essential guarantee of the I
army's own greatness. We intend to
defend it with the same energy against
the attacks and solicitations which
constitute the moat undeserved of in
sults. â¢
"We desire, above all, that appease
ment may be accomplished, and it will ;
come quickly if every one will give up
being a law unto himself and bow to
the law of the land.
"To accomplish the work which has !
devolved upon us, we have need of the
co-operation of Parliament and its j
whole confidence. We ask the widest i
mandate. We take the fullest responsi
bility. We ask for a truce of the ir
ritating discussions, hurtful to the In
terests of the country, and that you will i
vote without delay a law necessary to â¢
the good working of the public ;
services. If our efforts are not sterile,
disunion among Republicans will van
ish and the Republic will soon resume
the path of economic and social
progress."
M. Waldeck-Rousseau accepted aÂ«
order of the day, moved by M. Jules
Perillier, Radical Socialist, reading as
follows: '"The Chamber approving the |
declarations and acts of the Gov
ernment passes to the order of the
day."
Ernest Roche, Socialist, interpellated
the Government regarding the policy
and composition of the Ministry. He
declared It was a government of war,
and violently attacked the Minister of
War, General Marquis de Galifet.
Other speakers followed in a similar
I vein, and the orders of the day were
' moved, only two of them approving the I
1 ministerial statement.
: M. Waldeck-Rousseau replied to the;
i various interpellations, explaining the
I motives animating the formation of a
I Cabinet of somewhat divergent views,
i one of the main objects being to reunite '
â  all â 'Republican.!'. He added that the
j Ministers had already assumed some
I responsibilty. but he thought the back- !
ing of the Chamber was necessary for 1
I further steps and asked what Ministry
could for a moment tolerate acts seem- |
, ing to create the belief that the army
desired to constitute !{Â« clothe .1y : ar'Â» of!
its policy. â¢ He*, further - expressed -the! '
hope that it would not be necessary to j
I take more severe measures and said he
thought ii easy to demonstrate whence j
came the attacks upon the courts.
Explaining the inclusion of the rpti
eral. Marquis de Galifet. in the Cabinet
as Minister of War, he said it was be- |
cause the general had so spontaneously j
supported the constitution, and it was j
, thought the necessary punishment of
certain military men could be some
! what relaxed if emanating from such a
trusted authority as General 'de Galifet.
In conclusion the Premier said: "Our 1
task is heavy. Whatever course the j
: Chamber may pursue, I have done all j
my duty."
The speech of V. Waldeck-Rousseau
was much interrupted. The noise at
! times was deafening and several mem
bers were called to order. At the open- |
ing of the session the extreme Leftists
shouted: "Viva la Comm>*.7)e," and th
I Socialists frequently Interrupted the
proceedings, but M. Waldeek-Rous
seau's statement was much applauded
< by the Leftists and Centrists.
The Senate by a vote of IST to 25 ap
proved the declaration of the Govern
i ment.
INSULTING EPITHETS
HURLED AT GALLIFET
The New Minister of War a Target
for Attack, but He Remains
Unmoved.
Special Cabl* to The Call and the New York
Herald. righted, 1899, by .Tamps Gor
don Hennett. '
PARTS. June V,. By a majority of
tWenty-six the Waldeck-Rousseau Min
istry won its first battle to-day. The
issue seemed doubtful more than once
during the afternoon's sitting. It was
made very plain that a great many
Deputies there had no particular affec
tion for the new Cabinet. They even
said so, and in very unmistakable lan
guage.
Gentlemen who went Into the
tribunes and others- who remained upon
the floor of the house were never at a
loss for disagreeable things to say to
Waldeck-Rousseau with regard to the
"Eiffel syndicate, and found plenty of
material for reaching M. de I-anessan
about Cabinet affairs, but when every
thing else failed, there was always
some insulting epithet that could be
hurled at General de Gallifet. It was
a curious sight to see that handsome
soldier fronting a more bitter enemy
and a more withering fire of outrage
than he ever faced. on the battlefield.
He was the point of attack of the op
position and the center of observation
for everybody.
The new Minister of War might have
been cast in bronze for all the emo
tion he showed when the most hideous
insults ("assassin" was the mildest)
were pouring down upon him like rain
in a tropical storm. Not a muscle of
his face moved. He sat motionless, with
crossed legs and folded arms listening
attentively, as though his adversaries
were paying him compliments.
The only sign of feeling h**- exhibited
was a little impatient drumming of his
sunburned fingers upon the lid of his
desk during M. Mirman's speech, but
General Gallifet quickly repressed even
this little sign of life, and from one end
of the session to the other he gave a
superb example of self-restraint under
outrage. To army chiefs who have
chafed under rather outspoken criti
cisms and comments on the part of the
press General de Gallifet was indeed
a man of moment. As M. Mirman put
it, "the people in their simpie common
sense had already christened the Gov
ernment a Gallifet Ministry." and the
Minister of War certainly served as a
Turk's head f/>r the opposition.

WALLACE. Idaho, June 26.â The |
Missouri miners who refused
to Pign the permits are now
beir.g threatened with the bull
pen. TVie men Â«ren brought
to Burke under a heavy guard.
Xo one was allowed to approach the
train or speak to the men. As soon as
they reached Burke the Missourians
began to make inquiries regarding the
situation, with the result that less than
half cif the original number are now at j
work.
One of the men who returned to Wai- j
lacA to-day says that on his refusal to i
sign a permit he was approached by i
Sinclair, who- said: "Look here. I'm
not going to do any foolins with you.
Now, sign that permit or take the con
sequences."
The man signed it and left Burke last
night, walking to Wallace. He claims
he was induced to leave Missouri by a
telegram purporting to be signed by the j
Mayor of Wallace, stating that there
were no miners here, the union men
having all left the country.
The day in court was consumed in
the argument of a demurrer to the com
plaint against the County Commission
ers. The regular meeting of the board
must be held under the law on the
second Monday in July. Unless the
State authorities succeed in ousting the
Commissioners and getting in a new
board, which would be appointed by the
Governor before that time, they will
have no funds with which to carry on
operations.
The general situation has not altered
during the past twenty-four hours, and
interest Is centered on the effort to re
move the Commissioners and Sheriff.
Should the prosecution be unsuccessful
in this they would receive a severe set
back, for without the credit of the
county they would be seriously
hampered.
The defense asked for time to pre
pare a further affidavit showing cause
why Sheriff Angus Sutherland should
not be appointed ellsor. Judge Stewart
said he thought the defense had mad"
the case, but they argued that they had
no suspicion that Sutherland's appoint
ment was contemplated. The Judge
further said that charges of prejudice
must be specific or tne defendant could
allege prejudice against men as fast
as they could be named, "but I under
stand that the ellsor is appointed by
the court â not by the defendant."
Finally the matter went over until
morning, the defense being allowed to
produce affidavits from parties other
than defendants. After a long argu
ment, the motion to quash the citation
was overruled.
The defense then offered a motion to
quash the Information which met the
same fate. Then they filed a demurrer,
argument on which occupied nearly
the whole afternoon, judgment being
reserved until to-morrow. The real
contention of the defense was that the
action was criminal rather than civil
and that the action was not properly
brought, but the court overruled that
point.
The prisoners at Wardner to-day
voted on the question of giving bail,
deciding by a vote of 371 to 4 not to
give bail. ________ ______ ___

SPOKANE, June 28.â The body of En
sign John A. Monaghan arrived in the
city this morning and is now lying In
state at the City Hall. As soon as the
casket was placed on its resting place it
was covered with flowers, which were do
nated in such quantities as to not only
cover the box containing the body, but
almost fill the entire space inclosed by the
columns of the catafalque. The body will

when it will be taken to the Gonzaja
church, where the burial service will be
held.
EXTRA SESSION WILL
BE CALLED BY GAGE
Proclamation May Be Issued Within
' Sixty Days,
Railroad Agents Are Canvassing the State to Sound the
Legislators on the Caucus Scheme âD. H.
Burns Outlines the Programme.
GOVERNOR GAGE will rail an J
extra session of the Legisla
ture. Gage, Herrin, Burns and
their followers may deny this
assertion, hut the Governor j
will issue the proclamation
when Burns signifies that everything is
in readiness for the event. The Call
knows whereof it speaks whÂ°n it as
serts that Gage will call the special
session. As Genera! Barnes is out 0*
the race for the Senatorshlp and U. P.
Grant Jr. signifies a disposition to re
tire from public life, the followers of
Burns believe that the Mexican can
win out.
Agents of Burns and Herrin are can
vassing the State to sound the feeling
of legislators on the topic of an extra
session. Ten days ago The Call re
ceived authentic intelligence regarding
the route and inquiries of one of the
canvassers. This particular one was
formerly connected with this journal.
When his engagement with the paper
closed, the railroad managers supplied
him with free passes and sent him out
to ascertain how many Republican As
semblymen and Senators would agree
to enter a party caucus, in the event
of an extra session. Several members
of the Legislature, whose sympathies |
are with The Call in its battle to up- |
hold the honor and dignity of the State,
supposed that the man was still con- ,
nected with this paper, and therefore j
gave him their unreserved confidence
In speaking of the Senatorial situation ,
and extrf. session prospers. When
the facts were reported to railroad
headquarters, the agent was specially
commended for his sagacity and enter- ;
prise in obtaining for Herrin and Burns
andiGage certain information intended
for The Call.
Bum* has finally decided that Gage
shall call the extra session this year.
At first the Governor made some show
of resisting the decree of the Mexican.
but the resistance wrs slight. At orre
time Gage eam'e out openly with a
precise statement that he would not
call the members of the legislature to
gether in special session, but his mind
has undergone a change since he made
that declaration. He will issue the
proclamation, probably within sixty
days' time. To some extent the time
will be governed by the degree of
progress made by the Mexican in cor
ralling members of the Legislature.
Burns is so sure of^his ability to master
Gage that he speaks of the session as
if the whole programme had been ac
cepted and ratified.
Last Sunday, Burns, at the close nf
a conference on the subject of State
patronage, said to one of the men at
tending the conference:
"Governor Gage will call an extra
session <>f the Legislature within sixty
days. This has been positively decided
upon. The United States Senate is not
going to seat Matt Quny on the
Governor's appointment. It is all bosh
to suppose that the Senate is going to
reverse itself. A commission by execu
tive appointment would leave me out
of the reckoning. The only thing to do
is to call an extra session. Gage and I
have decided that this theory of allow
ing the newspapers to beat us out will
not go. The papers may crow now, but
we will show them who will do the
crowing at the finish.
"Tn canvassing: the legislators, we j
have not tried to pet them to agree to
vote for me," remarked Burns, but
continuing the Mexican paid: "We
merely asked them to agrer to go into ;
caucus. The United States Senate j
meets early In December, and T want
thirty days for preparation before I go
to Washington. When the extra ses
sion is railed, the Governor will hold
the Senate and Assembly at Sacra- j
mento until they caucus and send mo j
to Washington. He will keep them
there until Christmas if necessary."
Burns 1b further reported as saying
that the Governor would announce in
the call for an extra session that the
main purpose of convening the Legis
lature was the election of a United
States Senator. On this particular
point Burns will probably change
Gage's mind after Dibble has been
heard from. As Judge Dibble is an
expert in convening and adjourning
extra sessions, it is not likely that
Burns and Gage will permit his genius
In this special field to he wasted. There
may be many Legislatures and a band
of Senators, but there is only one Dib
ble. The call for the session may speci
fy the election of a Senator or it may
set forth that legislation to perfect the
work of the Code Commission is
amended.
Herrin. Gage, Burns and th<= Mexican
push generally are deluded if they im
agine that the canvass of the State to
promote an extra session was concealed !
from the press. The Call knew the day j
and hour that Dr. Maggard was inter
viewed by the railroad agent who rep- j
resented himself as a correspondent at- I
tached to a news syndicate. Incidents
of the agent's journey from town to
i town were known in this office. It was
known that Senators Bulla and Cutler
! and Assemblymen Lardner and Raub
S -were sounded, and that Assemblyman
La Baree was invited to talk through
the telephone. It is known further
! that the main office of the news syndi
cate is in the yellow building. It is
known that the agent made it a rule
to talk with Grant's supporters and get
their views on the caucus scheme.
Burns is boasting on the quiet that
sixty-one members of the Legislature,
have promised to enter the caucus, but
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
he says that he will not direct Gape to
iÃsue the proclamation until a greater
number Is enrolled, aa he wants a wide
margin to cover the falling down oÂ£
weak men.
Xo one can quite comprehend why
Burns entertains the notion that he
must have thirty days to prepare to pro
to "Washington. Previous departure
from the State has been made by the
colonel with much less time for prep
aration. Surely thirty days' time is
not required to prepare a speech. Xo
bond is required from a United States
Senator, so it is hard to explain why
the colonel wants thirty days for prep
aration.
The statement made by Burn? that
Gage will call an extra session is not
the only Indication that the {session
will he called. A State Senator who
became somewhat indignant recently
because he did not get desired recogni
tion in the distribution of water-front
patronage wrote that an extra 'session
was impending and that one of the sub
jects to be considered would probably
be the reorganization of the Harbor
Commission.
Trie attitude of TT. S. Grant's friends
is not to the liking of the Mexican.
Rumors come from the south that
Grant may yield to the persuasive im
portunity of his admiring supporters
and re-enter the race. Burns is now
boasting that sixty-one Republican
legislators have agreed to go into
caucus. It is amusing to observe that
Herrin. after the experience of last
winter, is not willing to take the Mexi
can's judgment as to the caucus agree
ment. The railroad politicians were bo
badly fooled at the regular session
that they advised Huntington in New
York that Burns could not be defeated.
Their confidence was .so great and their
predictions so positive that Collis P.
Huntingdon, as wily and wary as he is,
was deceived. Herrin is making his
rrv?n v ca^vsras'th'ts time. "His agents 8 â â 
their instructions and their transporta
tion from railroad headquarters and
make their returns to the railroad
office. Huntingdon is an exacting
master. He wants to know in black
and white just how each member of the
Legislature stands on the proposition
of going into caucus on the Senatorship.
It is Herrin's duty to give him the
straight tip, hence the canvass of the
-State under .railroad management.
T'nder the new arrangement Governor
Gage is practically relieved of all work.
Dibble will doubtless draw up tho
proclamation and* submit it tn Horrin.
The law department will then probably
rail in some lawyer to look it over
carefully, and if the document is all
right it will be handed to Burns. Wh^n
Burns gets it he will take it tn Sacra
mento ar.d tell Gage to sign it. Then
the vaults of the treasury will open to
the raiders.
DESERTED BY KIN AS
SHE NEARS THE GRAVE
Bending Under the Weight of Years,
Mrs. Emily Meller Enters a
Poorhouse.
SACRAMENTO, June 26. â pitiful spec
tacle was presented here this afternoon
when Mrs. Emily Meller. SO years of age,
with form bent anrl hair whitened, was
taken over the rough road to the County
Hospital, there tq- pass the sunset hours
of her life. Back of the Incident is. a
story that is calculated to intensify sym
pathy for her plight.
According to her story she has been
shamefully neglected by her own children,
who are well-to-do, and had it not been,
for a generous woman friend in this city
she would have starved to death. She Is
the widow of George Meller. a contractor,
who laid the mile or. more of stone walk
around the State Capitol. Several weeks
ago she called at the home of Mrs. George
Davidson, formerly the wife of Chief of
Police Dillman. deceased, and Informed
her that her relatives had deserted her
and that she was-penniless and without a
place to sleep. Mrs. Davidson generously
took her in. and the aped woman has
spent weeks in bed under her roof. It ap
pears that she has a son in the person of
John Cox, a farmer on the riverside road,
this county, and she says that he con
tributed the sum of $4 a month to her sup
port This princely contribution, accord
ing to her statement, was augmented by
$3 a month from her son-in-law. E. B.
Thome, a capitalist at 1473 Twenty-third
avenue East Oakland. But this munifi
cence suddenly ceased, says the aged,

VENTILATOR CAR SERVICE.
Proposition Said to Have Been Made
to Wells-Fargo.
NEWCASTLE. June 2'"..â A rumor ;r. in
circulation that a proposition has been
made by the fruit growers to Wells,
Fargo & Co. to put on a ventilator
car fervice for fruit shipments to Chi
cago. St. Paul, Denver, Helena, N*>w
Y'>rk and Boston, the cars to be attached
to passenger trains through to destina
tion. It is claimed that by the use of
ventilated fruit cars and the difference
of time made by the passenger train serv
ice, fruit will arrive at its destination in
us good shape, if not in better shapy,
than by the present system of refrlgern
tion. The charges on carload lots will
l.c brought down very- close to the pres
ent refrigerator charges, and possibly us
low.
The growers believe that, owing to
many instances during the season of di
verting cars caused uv sudden changes in
prices arid overstocking the markets
considerable expense can be saved. The
cars would reach their destination almost
before any sudden changes could cauÂ«e
great harm. Furthermore, there wouM
be bui little chance of overstocking the
markets, as shipments could be better
regulated.
Severn prominent growers have ex
presssed the opinion that ventilators have
be< n used heretofore by slow freight and
it would, certainly he a success now by
express. If the proposition meets the ap"
provaJ of the express company it will
be to the growers' advantage. All ex
press a hope that the express company
will take a decisive action and that the
proposition will be carried through.

t'nrnia :
To the Deciduous Fruit Growers *f
ornia: We, tht> hoard of directors
of the Fruit Growers' Association of Cal
ifornia, elected at a meeting of the Fruit
Growers of California, held at thp city
of Sacramento on June IT. IV#, respect
fully submit for your consideration the
following:
Firstâ We think ii advisable to estab
lish the principal place of business of t.i-'
asEociation ;it the city of Sacrament". < n
. . ; of its centra] location.
Second \v. recommend local fruit
growers' organization's In each locality
where any considerable quantity of fruit
is grown and shipped, such local organ
ization tci be auxiliary i<< aad work in
harm br>y with tn<- State organization.
Thirdâ We believe one of the great
sources of evil in this whole fruit ship
ping business is the truit from the <iif
rerent parts of the State coming into
competition, and to obviate this difficulty
in tn> future we recommend thai all de
ciduous fruit be distributed by the man
ager '>f the State association ai Sacra
mento. I'nder the present systen of
telegraph and telephone communication,
ail Shipping points in tm- State can be in
constant communication with Sacramento
and the shipping destinations can be
quickly sent to any locality where ship
ments aiv made. In this way the glut
in the Eastern markets can be obviated,
because the office in Sacramen'o will
know where every car has gone m] con
sequently an over-supply will not be s-ent
to any locality.
We propose to have our own agents in
the East to see that the fruit is properly
disposed of and to furnish cars for the
transportation of the same, charging for
refrigeration service only sufficient to
cover the actual cost, which cost we
guarantee shall he at least a reduction
of from â¢/â¢ to 70 per cent of present rates.
We believe a plan of this kind will
solve the fruit problem and permit what
profits there may lie in fruit growing to
go into the pockets of the growers instead
of into those of the commission men.
Let every fruit-growing locality in the
State organize and take 'stock in the
State organization, and as soon as the
total amount of stock so subscribed shall
amount to the sum of $300,000 the board
of directors will proceed to incorporate,
elect officers and be ready to transact
business; hut in no event shall the time
for receiving said subscription sum of
$300,000 be- extended beyond the luth day
of January, UhÂ».
Boycott on Techau Tavern.
The following circular has been issued
by the Musicians" Mutual Protective
Union of San Francisco to the various
trade and labor organizations of the city:
On account of the employment of "scab"
musicians, the San Francisco Labor Council
after exhausting all efforts to have union men
employed, have placed an official boycott on
the Techau Tavern, a "resort" recently opened
on Mason street, near Eddy.
Mr. Teehau. the proprietor (who antagonized
several ether unions in the fitting up of his
building), positively refuses to employ union
men. It Is our desire to make this boycott
effective and prosecute it vigorously, ahd you
are therefore earnestly requested to take such
action and pa^s and publish such resolutions
as you see fit tn show Mr. Techau that or
ganized labor Is entitled to recognition. It is
FUggested that a fine placed against any mem
ber patronizing the Techau Tavern would have
an excellent effect, and we would ask that such
action be taken.
A SUSPECTED BURGLAR.
Arrested by Detective Wren in a
Mason Street I/Odging-House.
"Jim" Halliker was arrested last night
by Detective Wren, locked up and placed
on the small book. He is suspected of
having been an accomplice in the burglar
izing of a lodging house on Geary and
Mason streets last Sunday night. The
party accused of the robbery is an ex
convict named Reynolds, who" travels un
<\vr tho alias of "Butts." Halliker, who
is a pal of Reynolds, called at the scene
of the crime last night and was caught by
the detective, who was in hiding. The po
lice expect to capture Reynolds to-day.
Hallikrr admits that the ex-convict com
mitted the robbery, hut says he was not
implicated.
A Work of Art.
One of the prettiest pieces of inlaid
work ever exhibited in this city is to be
sten in the State Board of Trade in the
ferry building. It is a large table made
of native woods by Julius Starky, who is
known a? the Yosemite \ alley artist
There are in all thirty-six different kinds
of California woods In the table and in
color they vary from white to a dark
green It has taken over a year to make
the table, but the gathering and seasoning
of the material has consumed over ten
years. The table will be here until next
year, when Its owner will exhibit it at the
World's Exposition in Paris.

EIGHT HOURS OF UPROAR
DELEGATES PREVENT ANY BUSI
NESS BEING TRANSACTED.
Two Ballots Taken on the Nomination
for Governor, and Goebel Still
Holds His Own Against
the Field.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOUISVILLE. Ky., June 26.â A con
tinuous performance of farce lasting
eight hours, a rare vocal entertainment
with soloists and a chorus of several
hundred voices, declamations and tin
horn tests of lung power, made up the
in'gramme of the sixth day's session
lof the Democratic State Convention,
and it narrowly escaped winding up in
| an exhibition of pugilism and gun fight -
I ing. From 10 o'clock until 6 to-day
Central Music Hall contained without
douht the most uproarious and disor
derly hody of men that ever gathered
for the transaction of political or other
business.
Angered by what they considered an
arbitrary ruling of the chairman in re
fusing to allow an appeal from his de
cision declaring out of order a motion
to remove policemen from the hall, over
half the delegates set about with all the
energy they could command to prevent
by sheer force of lung power the
: trnnsaction of any further business un
' till they secured a vote on the appeal.
This plan was successfully carried out
; until nearly 6 o'clock this evening,
when, principally because of utter phy
sical exhaustion, the filibusters allowed
. themselves to be outwitted, and the
' : vote on nomination for Governor, which
the chair had ordered early in the
' morning and had tried repeatedly to
proceed with, was concluded by having
the county chairmen, or as many as
would, come to the stage and^yell their
! votes at the clerk, who, at a distance
i of a few inches, was able to catch the
figures.
The teeth of recalcitrants having
, been pried open, the bitter dose slowly
trickled down and before they fairly
I renli2ed they were beaten, a second bai
loi was reached, this tipne with ltss
tribulation. These two ballots, both
fruitless. represent the day's work
: -of the convention. After they were
completed all were glad enough to ad
journ until 10 o'clock to-morrow morn
ing.
Behind this noisy entertainment three
c.-indidatos for Governor worked like
beavers. To-day it was clearly Goebel
against the field and the P.enton Coun
ty leader, cold and nerveless as ever,
has successfully defied his two oppo
nents to combine and beat him. They
may do it yet. but so far they have
: .shewn themselves woefully lacking in
ability to throw their vote in any one
direction or keep it silent when it seein
â¢â <] beet to their managers that no vote
he cast Goebel controls the organiza
tion of ih'' convention and through it
the State Central Committee, and they
probably will attack him here too, if
they can get together. To-day's events
will tend to bring them closer, but at
â in the fight is as open and as
fierce ;â ? it has been at any time.
The first ballot of the day resulted as
follows: Goebel. 352 M-; Stc.-ne, 261 V 2 ;
Hardln, 67. The last ballot, the thir
teenth, resulted: Goebel, 320^; Stone,

CALL HEADQUARTERS. WELL
INGTON HOTEL, WASHING
TON. June 26.â Secretary Algf-r
received a dispatch from Gen
eral Otis to-day reiterating his
statement that sn.nof) effective
men will be sufficient to enable him to
control the Philippines situation. This
dispatch was not made public, hut will
be laid before the President when Tie re
turns to Washington to-morrow.
The message from Otis was in response,
I understand, to a cablegram sent from
Washington yesterday' asking again if he
was in need of additional troops. As a re
sult of his statement there is a disposi
tion not to raise volunteers, although, as
the officials with whom I talked said,
this was a matter which the President
alone can now decide, and his decision
will be announced after his return.
In view of Otis' report that 12 per cent
nf his men are ill. it was stated at the
War Department that it was to provide
General Otis with a fighting force of 30.
--000 men at all times that additional regu
lars hflve been sent to Manila. The de
partment was advised to-day of the sail
ing of the transport Sheridan from San
Francisco with more than 1700 men and a
number of officers.
In military circles there is still hope
that the President, notwithstanding Ots'
statement that 30.000 m*-n are all he
i:> > j i!s. will authorize the raising of volun
teers. Expert strategists declare that for
the moral effect the call would produce,
if for nothing else. th*> President ouelit
to authorize the organization of at least
ten regiments.
General Otis, in a reply to a cable from
the War Department asking for informa
tion regarding the situation and condi
tions in the Philippines, to-day cabled a
long reply as follows:
MANILA. .June 26.â Adjutant General. Wash
ington: in the rainy season little inland
campaigning ie possible in Luzon. We occupy
a large portion of the Tagolog country, our
lines stretching from Imus on the south, to
San Fernando on the north, nearly sixty
miles, and to the eastward Into Laguna prov
ince. The insurgent armies have suffered great
losses and are scattered. The only large
force is held together, about 4000, in Tarlac
province and Northern Pampanga. Their
scattered forces are in bands of 50 to 500 in
other portions of Luzon. In Cavlte and Ba
tangas provinces they could, assemble possibly
2000, though demoralized from recent defeat.
The mass of the people arc terrorized by the
Insurgent soldiers and desire peace and Ameri
can protection. They no longer flee on the
approach of our troops unless forced by the
insurgents, but gladly welcome them. There
has been no recent burning of towns. The
population within our lines is becoming dense
and land cultivation is taken up extensively.
The people are kept out of Manila as much as
possible, as the city population is becoming
too great to be cared for. The natives of
Southeast Luzon are combining to. drive out
the insurgents, The only hope of the insurgent
leaders is United States aid. They proclaim
the near overthrow of the present administra
tion, to be followed by their independence and
recognition by the United States.- This Is the
influence which enables them to hold out;
much contention prevails among them, and no
civil government remains. Trad" with ports
not in" our possession, a former source of in
surgent revenue, are now Interdicted. I am
not certain of the wisdom of this policy as the
people In those parts are without a supply of
food and merchants are suffering losses. I
meditate restoring trade privileges, although
the Insurgents might reap the benefits. The
courts here are in successful operation under
the direction of able Filipinos.
Affairs in the other Islands are comparatively
quiet, awaiting results in Luzon. All are
anxious for trade, and repeated calls for
American troops are received. I am giving
attention to the Jolo archipelago and the Pala
wan Islands. The American troops have
worked to the limit of endurance. Volunteer
organizations have been palled In and replaced
by regulars, who now occupy the salient po
sitions. The Nebraska, Pennsylvania and
Utah regiments are. now taking transports, and
the Sixth Infantry has been sent to Negros
to relieve the California. These troops are in
good physical condition.
Sickness among the troops has Increased late
ly, due mostly to the arduous service and
climatic Influences. There Is nothing alarm
ing. Of the 12 per cent of the command re
ported sick, nearly 6 per cent is in the gen
eral hospital, of whom 3 per cent have typhoid
and 17 per cent malarial fevers; 12 per cert
have Intestinal trouble, the remaining 55 per
cent have various ailments, 14 per cent of
which are due to wound injuries. Many of
ficers and men who . served in^ Cuba break
down under the recurrence of the* Cuban fever,
SAYS THE BABY
WAS MURDERED
THROUGH SPITE
Proving a Motive in
Mrs. Adams' Case.
For many weary hours yesterday Wilson
Gray occupied the stand In Judge Law
lor's court as a witness against Mrs. Min
nie Adams, the mother of his illegitimate
son, who is on trial for the murder of
her infant, alleged to have been caused
by administering a dose of carbolic acid.
The accused sat through the day without
manifesting the least anxiety, but at times
a little impatience. If she is guilty of the
crime she. is of a peculiar composition and
worthy of the study of the most famous
All day long the prosecution endeavored
to prove a motive for the crime, the alle
fation belnff that little John Gray, the
cad baby, was the Innocent victim of the
mother's spite against the father. At
length the prosecution delved into Gray's
statement that the accused had threat
ened to leave the bottle of carbolic acid
within the dead child's reach, and had
even gone so far as to threaten to place
it in its tiny hands that it might drink
and satisfy the mother's craving for re
venge upon the father, who was devoted
to his child.
When the witness was finally turned
over to "W. E. Mack, who represents the
defendant, he found himself on the grill
in earnest. Mack started in by drawing
the record of the testimony given by Gray
before the Coroner at the time of the In
quest to prove that many of the State
ments of Gray during the trial were in
consistent with those made during the
proceedings before the Coruner's jury. All
he proved by following this line was that
at the Coroner's inquest Gray testified
that Mrs. Adams had found the baby car
rying around the bottle of carbolic acid
and that she had taken It from him, but
would never do so again if he chanced to
find it, while at the present trial he had
added that she threatened to place it in
his hands that he might drink it and sat
isfy his babyish curiosity.
It was next attempted on the part of
the defeniant's counsel to prove that
Gray was largely responsible for his mis
tress' animosity toward him by his ill
treatment of her and through his habit of
stealing money of her at opportune times.
Gray denied that he ever took any money
from the defendant, and the persistency
of Mack in following up this allegation led
and the regular regiments lately received are
inadequately officered. uns.

NEW BLACKMAILING SCHEME
A Woman of the Tenderloin Imports j
It From New York, but Judge â¢
Conlan Exposes It.
Harry Baxter, assistant engineer at I
the Spring Valley Water Wocks, Sunol. 1
was the victim of a new blackmailing- !
scheme, but through the careful investi
gation of Judge Conlan yesterday he es
caped, and the record of the woman in
the case will be looked into by the police
Baxter was arrested Sunday night by
Policeman Caples on complaint of Myrtle
Powers, 502 Bush street, on the charge
of stealing $17 50 from a powder box in
her room. The evidence shewed that the
woman accosted Baxter as he passed the i
door of the house and took him to her
room. He gave her money to get some
beer, and after she returned she accused
him of stealing $17 50 from . her powder i
box. He denied it. and she called in the
officer and had him arrested.
Baxter proved to the Judge that he
came to the city with over $90 and ex
plained how he had spent the evening
prior to meeting the woman. The Judgf
questioned the woman, and she said that
Bhe went to L.os Angeles a few weeks I
ago from New York and came on to this I
"I think this !. is a J new blackmailing
scheme." said the Judge, "Imported by
this woman from New York. I believe
the story of the defendant and the charge
against him is dismissed. I shall ask the
police to investigate the record of this
woman and keep a watchful evte on her." '
The woman had been charged with vag- '
n^l y Af^ > er case was called before the ;

Ing the facts, dismissed it at the request |
of Prosecuting Attorney Low
JUDGES WITHHOLD ACTION.
Members of the Superior Bench De
cide Not to Interfere in the
County Clerk's Dilemma.
No action was taken by the Superior
Judges at their meeting- yesterday in re
gard to the appointment of clerks for
the various departments of the court. A
communication from County Clerk Deane
directing their attention to the recent de
cision of the Supreme Court in which the
law was construed to materially reduce
the staff of his office was read. Mr.
Deane invited the Judges to decide in
what department the clerks authorized
by law should sit and take upon them
selves the responsibility of appointing
clerks for the remaining departments.
After the reading of the letter the
Judges decided not to take any action in
the matter until it comes to a crisis It
is expected that the appellate court will
grant a rehearing shortly. Auditor Wells
has signified his willingness not to refuse
warrants until the remittitur is handed
down by the Supreme Court.
Judge Daingerfleld will start on his va
cation to-day. During his absence Juris*

ONLY ONE ACCIDENT
Heavy Tugboat Collides With the
â¢j ' Craft Soon After It Reaches
the Water.
'Special Cabl* to ThÂ« Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1899, by James Gor
don Bennett.
LONDON. June 26.â The Shamrock,
the yacht which many expect to
bring the America's cup back to
England, was launched this after
noon from Yarrow's yard at Black
wall. The launch was a most suc
cessful one. The only incident which
. marred the event was the denting of the
forward port bow by an officious tug,
, which, after the challenger was resting
In the water, clumsily ran too near in an
attempt to cast a line for towing pur
j>6s<js".
' .:â  So eager was the desire to be on the
, fepot when the yacht went oft the ways
that some enthusiasts spent the entire
â¢ nig Tit in boats in front of the shed. About
r.;l o-'clock Sir Thomas Upton's guests, who
"" included Admiral of the. Fleet Karl of
Olanwilliam, Countess Clanwilliam, Lord â 
Charles Berecford, the Hon. C. Russell,
â¢ the Marquis of Dufferin and Ava, com
modore of the Royal Ulster Yacht Club;
Sir. George and Lady Faudel Phillips,
Right Hon. Herbert Gladstone, Hon. W.
' Syspjish and William Gibson, M, P., began
to arrive.
â¢ Abput 3 o'clock the christening party
moil] the steps to the stand which had
been erected under the bow. Workmen
i were busy removing the last remnant of
the 'scaffolding-, and soon quiet took the
place of bustle. Then was heard the
merry ring of the hammers upon the
hardwood wedges. It was at exactly 3:33
! o'clock that the faint echo of a cheer,
three times given, was heard from the
tipper depths of the shed in which the
yacht lay veiled.
The eager crowd which had been watt-
Ing- so patiently and so long under the
broiling sun at once accepted that cheer
as ' a token that the christening, which
4 vas performed by Lady Russell, and that
m he toasting of success to the new boat
â  were over, and took up the cheer in right
ihearty fashion, which was doubled In
volume as the yacht was seen to start
moving down. She glided gently at first,
, fining speed but â  ever rushing. Sitting
' t-asily and gracefully on her cradle, with
'Â« crowd of anxious workmen leaning over
her stern, thÂ« Shamrock slid down the
ways:
It had been said that the lines of the
yacht would be concealed from view by
a' curtain till she was fully immersed, but
that was not so. As she slid from the
ehed In which she had been hiding during
the period of building it was seen t&at
only the stern was enshrouded to hide her
from prying eyes and 'from cameras 'ill
she got into the water, and her graceful
I' linos and beautiful shape were revealed.
.It was truly a â : gnii ent picture, 'me
only' paint which showed was a broad
emerald reen band round the upper por
tion of tho hull, with a narrow molded
cord of gold. Then right down to the
keel the bare metal polished as smooth as
a mirror shone In the sun like brightly
burnished gold.
Now the spectators could not but be
Etruck by the trutn of what the expert,
â¢who had bet-n privileged to see the yacht
before, had said that never before has
tuch a beautiful, such a perfectly modeled
pfcimen of a racer been launched in any
of three kingdoms, and that if the Sham
rock does not wrest the much-coveted
cup from Its holders across the waters,
then this country need never try again. In
tthe opinion of an expert with whom 1
talked tho Shamrock revealed herself as
a mixture of British and American de-
Figns. Aft she is Herreshoff, forward she
Is Fife. In her aft <>art she is a Vigilant
over again, and in her bow she is purely
of Fife design.
A few seconds after she emerg?'! from
her shed the Shamrock struck the water,
yet gently and without a splash. So
quickly aird so smoothly did she glide on
to the bosom of the Thames that ihe
boats packed bo closely around hardly
felt any swaying from the wave's
caused by the displacement of the water.
The excitement was terrific, and many
of the workmen in their boats, their coats
decked with emerald ribbons, joined in a
chorus song about "The Dear Little
Shamrock of Ould Ireland" in pure cock
ney accent.
Then there were shouts as a small boat
in some unaccountable manner got over
turned and the Thames police dashed to
the rescue of two men struggling in the
â water. Bui that was nothing to the Â»x
--citement which was created when, as the
Shamrock swung round, the tugboat Kx
celsioi was seen with full steam on, bear
ing straight down upon the yacht to
catch a tow rope. The tug was trying to
turn, but would she clear the Shamrock
In time to save her from disaster? There
were â  shoutsâ yells, ratnerâ horror.
"Back herâ back her," frantically cried
hundreds of voices.
The Excelsion was turning her nose
away at the same time, but it was too
lute to avoid a collision. The shouts
ceased, and people sat tightly in their
boats holding their breams. Was t..e
Shamrock to be smashed at her very
k birth? Then the pent up emotion found
vent again in another chorus of heart
rending yells of mingled rage, dismay and
despair. "The heavy tug Wai on the Sham
rock. She struck her full on the port
bow but not with a crash or crac*., as
would have occurred in a collision with
an ordinary built vessel. It was rather
a dull .sou fid and as the tug backed off
and tin; yacht recoiled from the blow It
. was seen that there was no hole, no
â  break but simply a nasty dent left in
". the plate, revealing the fact that it was
â¢of soft, yet strong metal.
It was a pathetic picture to see the
workmen aboard the yacht, who had
taken such pride in the building of the
"beautiful boat, shouting and wringing
their hands and running aft, shielding
. their eyes to shut out from sight the
â disaster which to their frenzied minds
â¢ for a time seemed so serious. What a
relief It was- to find that the damage was
npt serious and nothing but some ham
mering and polishing was needed to
remedy it. It was surely an exciting but
successful launch.
Lady Russell of Killoween in christen

SATISFIED WITH
THE COLUMBIA
New Cup Deferjder Accepted by
Iselin Without a Further
Builder's Trial.
The New Cup Defender Columbia Under Sail.
gRISTOL, R. 1., June 26. â After a conference among the owners of
the new cup defender Columbia, Colonel Oliver Iselin, the man
aging owner, notified the Herreshoff Company this afternoon that
the yacht would be accepted without a further builder's trial. The
owners expressed themselves more than wuisfu-d with the per
formance of the yacht in yesterday's trial. The formal transfer was
made this afternoon to Mr. Iselin as managing owner of the Morgan-
Iselin syndicate.
The remarkable performance of the Columbia in Narragansett Bay last
Sunday, when she "walked" away from the Defender, almost insures the
retention of the America's cup in this country for another year at le;ust.^The
picture above, representing the yacht under sail, was drawn by W. A. Coul
ter, The Call's marine artist. The sails were drawn from the sailmaker's
draught, a copy of which was received by The Call yesterday, and are neces
sarily correct. This, with an accurate drawing of the hull and spars, made
from a photograph, gives an excellent idea of the flier ad she a pp<
going down the bay from Newport The rig is unique in some respects, and
it Is believed the arrangement of the jibs will prove a great success. Above
the jib proper is jib topsail No. 1; then comes jib topsail No. 2, and above
that ls the baby jib topsail.
| the Shamrock was safely berthed In the
r basin, where her spars are lying.
Thomas l-iipton, who was In inch
spirits, was asked a question regarding
the prospects of the yacht, and he said:
"We have engaged to win back the Amer
i. a's cup. We have fairly extended our
selves and it we are beaten all I >an say
is. honor to th* yacht which Is better than
the Shamro.-k."
William Fife Jr.. designer of the Sham
rock, remarked: "Brains and all that care
i ful thought and knowledge of naval archl
â¢â  ture can put Into the yacht is there.
Every man of us is satisfied that with a
fair field we shall give a tight race to any
opponent. The Shamrock goes around to
Southampton to-morrow or Wednesday
for just those little arrangements that a
racing experience gives, and then for the
Journey which we hope will herald the
Admiral Beresford said: "I consider the
hull of the Shamrock to be a remarkable
triumph of construction. She is built on
original lines. In the water she is â  |
Ftriklng as out of it. In my opinion her
underwater construction is unique. Her
apparent great beam is necessary to sat
isfy the tremendous Bea of canvas. It is
impossible to forecast the prospects. TakÂ«
the case of the Meteor, which Is
era ft, yet she is racing with great suc
cess. The Shamrock's designer and build
l er have proceeded on the soundest lines
! for lightness and speed, and if she ls not
I the swiftest afloat I shall be surprised.
Hut we must recollect that the Americans
know a good craft, and we can depend
that their Invention will run us hard."

he was a thief.

MARKET OPENED TO
CALIFORNIA TUBERS
Golden State Must Supply the Army
in the Philippines With
Potatoes.
T.OS ANGELES, June 21.â Commercial
circles are considerably flurried over the
prevailing condition in the potato market.
The crop of 'Southern California promises
to be larpo and is rapidly maturing. Tu
bers are of good growth and fine quality.
The Hurry arises from the extraordinary
demand that has developed for exporta
tion to the Philippines. The potato crop
in far Eastern American possessions ls
limited. As California and the Pacific
Coast States will be compelled to supply
the deficiency in the islands, an unusuai
export demand has developed.
The fe<-dinK of 35,000 American soldiers
In the Philippines is a matter of deep
concern to the commissary department.
It is understood that Woolz & Co. of San
Francisco will, as they did last year, ship
under Government contract hundreds of
tons of potatoes to Manila during 1599.
A number of orders for shipment to the
north have been canceled. Ten carloads
have been shipped from Los Angeles In
the past few days. "Woolf & Co. will for
ward a shipload of .potatoes to Manila
this week. The demand for potatoes also
extends to Portland, Or., owing to the
poor condition of the crop In that State.
The lateness of the season there, together
with recent rains, did more damage to
the potato crop than was expected.
COARSE ATTACK UPON

French Writer Opposes the Advanced

Special Cable to The Call and the New York

BRUSSELS, June 26.â The Revue Gen
eralc. a well-known Belgian magazine,
patronized by most of the leaders of the
j Catholic party, has consented to publish
| a violent onslaught on Archbishop Ire
i land by the French clerical writer, Rl
cault d"'Hericault. The writer finds Mon
signor Ireland much too advanced. He
says:
"The American Archbishop recently
came to France as a commercial traveler
of revolutionary ideas. The French Cath-
I olics were struck at hearing a foreigner
pretending to teach them how they were
to behave themselves, and at the real
scandal caused by this successor of the
apostles. We offer our congratulations to
i France upon having become a Free Ma
-1 sonic republic, which exiles some of Its
â  priests and sends others into the army,
I and closes convents. Many French pre
: lates looked upon Ireland as a savage.
He has been truly described as a bomb
! shell."
The article, couched in coarse language.
Is causing quite a scandal.

H. G. Denman Declares the Reports
of Sierra Pintada Discoveries
Were Started by Owners
of Vessels.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGEI.ES, June 26.â H. G. Den
man, an attorney of Washington, D. C,
who came to Los Angeles last December
for the benefit of his health, Joined the
throngs that were attracted to the Sierra
Pintada placers during thÂ© recent excite
ment. Denman was among the first to go
to Lower California, and. declaring the
reported rich finds a fako, he is highly in
dignant ami threatens to bring suit
against steamship companies for fostering
what he alleges was an imposition upon
hundreds of honest but sincere men.
"In my opinion every transportation
company wnich in any way encouraged
the gigantic fake that led scores to go and
: seek their fortunes in the San Rogue
placer fields should be prosecuted," said
! Denman to-day. "I am not at all sure
! that 1 shall not return to this coast ;is
j soon as possible and bring suit for dam
ages against one of the companies at least
on my own account.
"While visions of a great fortune quick
ly and easily acquired undoubtedly floated
before my mental vision," continued Den-
I man. In telling of his experience, "I be
lieve my desire to go through the exciter
ment of a mining boom was my greatest
Incentive to make the Journey. I had read
bo much of the wild life of the early min
ing camps of Colorado and California 1
thought it would be a thrilling experience
to be part and parcel of the life of one of
the new camps In San Rogue. I made the
i ocean trip from San Diego on one of the
Bhipa that profited most by the excite
'â  ment and then w.-nt overland to the al
leged placer Melds on horseback. 1 paid

day In San Rogue district was sufficient
to "convince me 1 had been made tht; vic
tim of a gigantic fake. The steamer ac
! commodations were not of the best and
I the trip overland had been hot, dusty and
: disagreeable. . .. T
â¢â¢] am not alone in my indignation. I
found many victims as thoroughly angry
as myself. Many of these were in a much
worse nx. The men had spent every cent
' to get to the camp and were almost pen-;
liil.ss. They had accepted the stones of
; a tremendously rich strike having been
made, and thought that all that was n.-c
--essary to acquire riches was to reach ban
Koque Many of these poor fellows were
working desperately in the almost bar
ren dirt when I left, in hope of grettinz
sufficient gold from the earth to pay then
passage home. But theirs was an almost
hopeless task, and in preference to un
dertaking such a Job, many of the men
who found themselves 'strapped among
the Impoverished placers started to tramp
back to civilization.
"In my opinion the ship owners ami
and transportation companies that were
benefited by the rush to San Roque--or
some of them, at leastâ took advantage
of the fact that a few Mexicans and In
dians were digging from four bits to a
dollar's worth of gold a day each out of
the placers, to spring a gigantic fake. I
think they are liable. A man would have
to take out at least $20 in gold a day at
San Rogue to make the venture a paying 1
one." â¢

TEXAS WATCHING
THE CATTLE DEAL
Officials Say Law Must
Not Be Violated.
NEW ACT PROHIBITS TRUSTS
BUT THE SYNDICATE PROCEEDS
IN SECURING OPTIONS.
Prominent Stockmen of the Opinion
That the Combine Will Benefit
the Great Industry of
the Lone Star State.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
AT'STIN, Tex.. June 26.â Attorney Gen- !
era! T. S. Smith stated to-day that he
would keep his eye on the gigantic syndi
cate that is now seeking to get control i
of all the rattle In Texas. Under the pro
visions of the anti-trust law of the State
the live-stock industry is exempt, but there
Is no such exemption in the new anti
trust law which goes into effect January
31, 1900. If the present combination of
capita] that is securing options on all th.:
available cattle and ranches in Texas in
in the nature of a trust within the mean
ing of the new and far-reaching anti-trust
act, and should it be In operation when
the law becomes effective, it will meet
with a vigorous prosecution at the hands
of the State.
It is the opinion of prominent stockmen
that the operations of the syndicate will
be of benefit to the cattle industry and |
that it will be impossible for them to i
frieze out the cattlemen, who will profit
by the raise in prices. Should the pyndi- |
cate be successful in its present negotia
tions, it is the intention to stock up its |
ranches to the limit and by a concentra
tion of effort to handle the stock on a
mere economical basis than is being done \
at presi nt.
According to reliable information ob
tained here to-day, the great syndicate
has already secured options on the;
ranches and cattle of the following ex- ;
tensive stockmen of the Panhandle coun
try: Johnson Brothers, ('. < '. Slaughter,
Winfleld Scott. Crowder Brothers. R. C.
; "Ware. A. B. Robertson. John Scharliauer
I and a number of other smaller ranchmen.
The aggregate number of cattle owned by !
the foregoing stockmen is about 800,000
head <>r nearly one-sixth of the estimated
total number of cattle in the State.
Governor J. I). Sayers received the fol- !
lowing reply to-day to the invitation to j
attend the proposed anti-trust conference I
to be held in St. Louis September 20. from j
Governor Henry T. Gage of California:
"I would like very much to be with you :
on the occasion referred to, when the im- ;
I portant question of trusts will be und-r
consideration, but am so circumstanced j
that it will be impossible for me to at
tt nd. I trust that much good may be
evolved from the conference."
Governor W. D. Blancham of Florida
writes: "I have had a conversation with
j the Attorney General and hope that he
will be able to be with you at St. Louis
to take into consideration the objects set
forth in your communication. It Is im
possible for me to determine now whether
I can be with you or not. However, if
the Attorney General is there every pur
pose will be subserved."

protection of private property at sea with
the exception of contraband of war in

question of private property at sea and

We will push the matter energetically, in

and that if its competency is doubtful a
liberal interpretation is necessary- We
believe that if the proposals are rejected

plenty of cartridges. People who have ;
known him for a long 1 time Bay that if any j
of the Sheriff's posse that has been out
since dark last night trying to round him ,
up find him there will be a story of
bloodshed to chronicle.
Somers is wanted by the authorities for
having: just before dark yesterday am- |
bushed Christopher Gailbraith. a tavern i
keeper nnd ditch tender on the Washing-:
ton Ridge, ten miles above here. lie
pumped a handful of .small shot from a
double-barreled bird gun into Gailbraith s
face head, stomach and hands at a dis- j
tance of thirty feet. The wounded man
made a dash toward Ids assailant nnd the
would-be assassin lied, his gun being
empty. Gailbraith followed till the blood
from his wounds blinded him. Then he
turned back and. jumping into his sulky,
sent his horse spinning down the road
toward the Central House, three-quarters
of a mile below, where he lives with his
wife.
He had gone a quarter of a mile when
Somers sprang from the roadside and,
leveling a rille, lived at his victim fora
third time. the bullet just grazing Oail
braith. A sudden turn in the road .- that
point took Gailbraith out of sight.
Gailbraith hurried home, got . his own
rille and started back afoot to settle '
scores with his enemy. He had gone but
a hundred feet from the door when he j
I sank to the ground, fainting from the loss â

from- Gailbraith's place, but he did not
heed it. Yesterday afternoon he went
thr-re drunk and .firmed, and wanted; to

challenge. Somers then hastened up the i
line of the ditch, raised a waste gate and |

A CASE OF LOADED
DICE AND MAYHEM
DRTVATE WILLIAM 11. RICE, Company IS. casual detachment, mourns
the loss of his Ipaded dice. This is not all of his trouble, for Just at pres-
I ont his sorrow over the loss of his "lead-pipe cinch" Is accentuated by the
â *â¢ fact that he is nursing- three fingers upon his right hand, which Private
Thomas Clancy, Company 19, casual detachment, chewed into a pulp yester
day afternoon while Hlce was forcibly trying to persuade him to give up the
afon sa d dice. Kiee is a Btudent of the weaknesses of his fellow soldiers, and
knowing the propensity that they have for gambling he made a pair of dice,
which he has since stated, owing to the beautiful way in which they are load
ed, he valued at $25. He inaugurated the game of "chuck-a-luck," and since
last payday he has won a fortune, having got everything in sight On Sun
day afternoon he was conducting the game as usual just In the rear of the
quarters below the adjutant's office. Clancy was in the game and he was los
ing every time the dice were thrown. Suddenly an officer appeared upon the
Bcene.
In the wild scramble that followed Rice grabbed all the money in sight
while Clancy landed with both feet on the dice. Clancy had an eye for busi
ness and he wanted to recuperate his sadly diminished pile. Rice began a
search for his $26 dice, but nobody had seen thorn, so he gave his "tapioca"
bones up as lost. Yesterday afternoon Clancy surprised his companions by
iming out as the full-fledged proprietor of a "chuck-a-luck" game.
Things were coming hi? way, for the dice were rolling to perfection, and
inry was rnking in the dough with both hards, when Rice hove upon the
rind recognizing' his bones demanded them. Clancy stoutly refused to
give up his "good things," and when Rice started to take the dice the two
9 mixed without further parley.
They paid no attention to ring etiquette, but went at each other hammer
and tongs. Rice had scored three knock-downs when Clancy, realizing that
he was at n disadvantage at long range, closed in upon his opponent and
g Rice's right hand in his mouth began to chew with a] his strength.
too much for Rice, and he gave up the tight and began to call
fi r help. When finally some of his c>i r :â¢ i, who came to his assistance,
managed to disengage his hand from Clancy's teeth Rice's three middle fin
gers were hanging by threads of flesh. Rice was taken to the general hos
where his hand was dressed. What became- of the $25 dice deponent

QUARANTINE
OFFICERS ARE
NOT DISTURBED
No Danger Here
From the Plague.
IT CANNOT POSSIBLY ENTER
___^_ â
FAITH PLACED IN HEALTH LAWS
OF HONOLULU.
Usual Precautions Will Be Taken
With the Maru, but Doctors Are
Sure They Will Not Be
Necessary.
Dispatches in yesterday's papers tell
ing of the presence of the bubonic plague
on the Nippon Mara, bound for this port
and now in quarantine at Honolulu, nave
caused no more than passing interest
among I,he quarantine authorities here.
There is no expectation that the disease
wilL enter San Francisco, and every reli
ance sot-ms to be placed in the health reg
ulations of the Islands. The Federal sys
tem of quarantine has not yet been es
tablished at Honolulu, but thÂ« re is a rep
resentative of this Government attached
to the American consulate there, whose
business It is to Bee that so far as this
country .- concerned the quarantine laws
are properly enforced.
Under the laws of the islands a ship
Infected must remain in quarantine for
seven days after being thoroughly fumi
sated. In cases of bubonic plague the
regulations of this port are the same as
those relating to cholera, which require
a detention of fourteen days. A thor
ough fumigation of the vessel, passengers
and freight, with detention of the passen
gers. Is bout all- the quarantine officer?
think will be necessary, even should there
be any more cases on the Nippon Mam,
which" they very much doubt. Dr. Law
lor Health -Officer of the city, does not
see much danger in the present of th
plaguo at the Island quarantine station.
"The disease will not set a foothold
-..,-, ; it cannot." he said. "To make the
disease epidemic there must be the same
conditions existing as obtain In Asiatic
countries. Th( people here do not live
topether like pigs. and they know how to
take care of themselves. In the countries
where thÂ« plague flourishes the domestic
animals occupy the house with the peo
ple. There Is no idea of ever cleaning
th- floor, and when an appearance of
cleanliness â¢- desired all the people do is
to put a new layer of matting on tbo
iloor They have no idea of sanitary
regulations and they foster the plague by
the filthy way in which they live. If the
quarantine regulations are properly en
forced at this port there can be no flan
ger of any case of the plague getting In
here. With the quarantine at Honolulu
In addition to the local precautions, the
entrance of the plague is impossible."

WRECKED THE STAND.
Damage Caused hy a Runaway Horse '
on Ellis St -t.
There was an exciting runaway yester
day afternoon on Mason street. A horse
attached to a cart was being driven down
the treet from O'Farrell street, when one
of th*- whr.r>] s dropped off and the animal
v-ont rushing down the hill, after spilling
the driver out upon the cobbles. The way
was c]oar and the frightened animal
headed straight for the I.aneliam saloon.
Just before reaching that point a passing
vehicle caused the runaway to swerve,
and in bo doing he threw the cart Into a :
bfintb'T^k's stand. "Veto." who presides
over the stand, was asleep on one of his
chair? at the me. while a claret-colored ;
glass indicated what had been used to
promote slumber. Veto did not have time
to ike up when the shock came. He
was thrown bodily upon the sidewalk, and
c.v^r I'im was a fine assortment of wreck- i

In the Freshman Eight-Oared Event
Cornell's Crew Finishes in
Front With Plenty to
Spare.
Pneclal Dispatch to The Call.
POT'OHKKErSIE. N. V.. June 26.â The
four-oared race over the two-mile course
to-day was won by Pennsylvania. Time;
11 minutes and 12 seconds. Cornell was
seeon.l. Time, 11 minutes 14 3-5 seconds.
The freshman eight-oared race between
Pennsylvania, Columbia and Cornell over
the two-mile course was won by Cornell.
Time, s minutes 65 seconds. Columbia was
second, one and one-cuarter boat lengths
behind Cornell. Time. 10 minutes. Perm- :
sylvania was third, three boat lengths be- ]
hind Columbia. Time. 10:10.
At the crack of the pistol the two four
oared crews from Cornell and Pennsylva
nia Mok the water together, but the Penn
sylvania stroke started at 36. while tho
Cornell stroke was only 34. The Pennsyl
vania stroke, while not as prettily rowed i
as Cornell's, had much more go in it, and
before the boats had gone ten lengths the
Quakers had showed their boat's nose
ahead of the Ithacana. Cornell had
dropped down to the Courtney stroke of
33 to the minute, and although inch by
inch the Quakers' boat shoved to the
front, they never increased during the i
mile.
At the hridge a collision seemed almost i
imminent. Both crews had steered rather,
badly at the start, angling In toward the.;
shore. Just as they got undo: the shadow
of the great bridge and when Pennsyl
vania had succeeded in obtaining a lead of
almost a shell length, the ferry boat
crossed the river and threw a heavy
swell. Either because tlv^ Pennsylvania
oar who did the steering felt the effect! of j
the swell and turned toward its (â â¢â¢nter. or ;
else lost his bearings, the ?h>';i turned al
most directly toward Cornell, and to
avoid a seemingly probable collision the
Cornell boat was turned away also, i
Quick as a flash Pennsylvania straight- |
ened oul again, and when they cleared |
the great abuttments it was seen that
Pennsylvania had a lead oxer Cornell of
fully a length and a quarter, there being I
clear water between the boats. From 'â 
this point of the battle to the finish there i
was little material change, unless it may
have been at the ir^ie and three quarters â 
mark, where Cornell hit the stroke up to
34 and started to close up the ;iap. The !
Quakers, who had been rowing from one :
and a half to two strokes per minute â 
faster than the [thacans all through the i
race, seeing that Cornell was spurting,
whipped their stroke to SP, and crossed ,
the line a winner by one length and a :
half. i
The freshmen's race, which was started |
very promptly after the four-t)ared finish, |
was ore of the closest and most exciting
races seen on the river in years, the Co
lumbia crew giving the Cornell crew a!
sharp and pretty fight for first place and
making phenomena! time, considering the
slowness of their stroke. At the sound
of the pistol the crews got away "in a
bunch." hut at the settling down of the
stroke to the crews' usual style it was
that Cornell had poked the pointed
nose of her shell n few feet ahead of the
line. Fnr the first half mile the struggle
was so exciting that the spectators arose
on the press car and in the observation
train and cheered for each 'Tew. Cor
nell was rowing a long, sweeping stroke
of 34. while Pennsylvania was rowing at
the rate of 35. Columbia was rowing a
phenomenally long strokeâ 32 -the wonder
â¢pf all th*> experts on the train, for the
â  â¢.â â¢ went along almost as fast as the
-'.ell boat.
Close together the three boats hung, but
there was something about the way the
Cornell boat seemed to glide over the
water that made Columbia and Pennsyl
vania hearts' go down. As the crews
reached the mile mark the Cornell boat I
was about a half length out from the i
bunch. Columbia began to lose after the j
mile wns passed, and soon Cornell had
a lead of a clear length. Pennsylvania
was in the meantime steering erratically ]
at thn mile mark, going out of the course
badly.
Just after passing the point the Penn
sylvania boat seemed to lose power and
dropped rapidly astern as the Columbia
stroke hit it tip to 34 in an endeavor to
close up the gap between Cornell's boat
and theirs. Cornell responded with a
stroke of :>,*.
When the boats crossed the finish line.
Cornell led with a boat and a quarter
length to spare and Pennsylvania was
three boat lengths behind Columbia. The .
time of Cornell was 9:55, not so good as '
that made by Yale in 1*97â 9:19â 0n the I
same course.

DEATH OF AN EX-SENATOR.
Timothy McCarthy Passes Away Full
of Years and Honors.
"Ex-Senator Timothy McCarthy, who
died Sunday night at the residence of his
j sister. Mrs. .1. N. Driscoll. fi22 Willow ave
nue, has been so Ions: and so favorably
; known in this community that his demise
j will be looked upon by the large number
of those who knew him well as a personal
calamity.
Senator McCarthy came to this State In
'68 from New York, his native city, where
his father was a large builder and con
; tractor and an influential member of the
local Democratic party. Senator McCar
thy, who had been educated in the busi-
I ness of his parent, at first interested
himself in the building trade here. But
i taking naturally to politics, it was not
long before hÂ»: had become a powe; in
municipal matters and was elected to the
position of Supervisor, which place he
filled twice, only relinquishing the office
to serve two terms in the State Senate.
Though Senator McCarthy's life had
been passed almost entirely in a political
atmosphere, yet such was the rectitude of
his character that even his most bitter
political opponents never attempted to
attribute any but the purest motives to
any of his acts.
He was the friend of such men as Stan
: ford and Hearst, who listened to and ac
knowledged the wisdom of his councils,
though they were often forced to follow
1 a different prith.
With, all the organizations of his day
; Senator McCarthy was hand in glove, and
1 there are still left a few of the old timers
who can recall the nights when " 'Mac'
| ran with the old machin'."
Though Senator McCarthy had oppor-
J tunities that would have made a less
scrupulous man many times a millionaire
i he leaves but a comparatively small for-
I tune, which will be divided among his sur
viving children, a married daughter and
two sons.
Mass will be celebrated and the funeral
will take place from St. Mary's Cathedral
on Thursday morning at 10 o'clock.

WHIMSICAL WIT
AND GAY FANTASY
OF LADY URSULA
Audacious Essay in j
Romantic Comedy.
COULD IT BE A SATIRE?
HOPE'S MALE IMPERSONATOR A
FIGHTING ROSALIND:
A Uniquely Clever Play Handsomely
Produced in Spite of Nervous
ness in the Miller
Company.
BY ASHTON STEVENS.
Anthony Hope's trust in our trust
fulness is audacious to say the least.
Here in "The Adventure of "Lady Ur
sula," which Henry Miller and his com
pany played in the Columbia Theater
last night, he takes it for granted that
we will believe that the heroine of the
play, who dresses up In her younger
brother's clothes, makes the hero be
lieve that she 'believes that he takes
â¢her for a man through the better part
of two full-sized acts. Audacity is
hardly the name for it. It is simply
the summit of darodevllment. And yet,
in a way. It wins.
You find yourself getting mightily
Interested in the affairs of this young
Lady Ursula. She 110007-00? ;.Â« real a
creation as the star heroine of your
fairy tale day?. You hear about her
feigning a swoon at the door <>f Sir
George Sylvester's house, just because
he has vowed that no woman shall
cross the threshold; you hear, from her
"\vn lips, that Sir George was equal to
the ruse and politely offered her the
shelter of his porter's lodge, and that
her brother, on finding this out. sends
a speedy challenge to Sir George, whivh
is accepted. And then her brother,
Lord Hassenden, enters the scene him
self and h'-jips no end of acid re
proaches on the head of his sister when
she explains that the whole thing came
about through a wager of hers with
his betrothed that a woman would suc
ceed in entering Sir George's house.
Now the fun commences in real earn
est, for gentle Ursula dons the breeches
of the free-legged sex and beards the
lion in his den. Sir George has been a
deadly duelist, and she fears for her
brother's life. Artfully she plies a
â¢woman's wit, explains the reckless
wager, and in the guise of a loving
younger brother paints a glowing pic
ture of the sister Ursula, and finally in
duces Sir George to call the fight off.
Here the complications commence, for
Sir George is at opce for being con
ducted by his guest to her peppery
brother and to her sister. If not the
guest has the alternative of putting in
thÂ» night at Sir George's. Honors!
Thp be-trousered Lady Ursula takes
the first choice, and while Sir George
is making ready for the journey slips
out into the night and off for London
town ti> her brother's quarters. Here
she encounters a band of noisy blades,
full of punch and tight, and soon the
masquerading maiden is about to par
ticipate in a bloody duel because, by
Gad. sir! she will not admit that the
Lady Ursula has the squints. EnLer
Sir George, who parts the hostilities in
the middle by claiming a previous en
gagement with the young stranger.
She choses pistols, one loaded, the other
empty; distance, across the table. They
take ' their positions. "One! two!"
drones the master of ceremonies. And
then Sir George calls a halt and refuses
to fight. "When the company.retires he
makes many pretty speeches to her and
bids her carry tender messages to
Ursula. And perhaps this handker
chief that bears Ursula's name and
was somehow or other discovered in his
houseâ perhaps, says Sir George, she
will once again invade his monastery
and bring it with her.
Sure enough, the next act finds her
at Sir George's, handkerchief in hand,
and her fighting brother in hot pursuit.
But explanations are given and taken
and all ends with nothing more serious
than the promise of a wedding.
Now set up in the quick type that
follows a performance that gives out at
something like half -past eleven o'clock,
this may read like the argument of a
comic cpera. But "The Adventure of
Lady Ursula" is not a comic opera. It
may be â way down deepâ a satire on
the romantic drama of the day, but
on my soul it Is- not a comic opera, nor
even a farce. It is a transparent, light
waisted adventure into playwriting,
and a cleverly fantastical play. While
it is going an you want to believe in it,
you try with all the good nature that
In in you, and lots of the time you suc
ceed. It is only after the last curtain
is down that you realize just how much
you have fooled yourself. Yuu might
as well try to take Rosalind seriously
as Ursula, who is a matter of picture
and poetry. Indeed. I may say with all
modesty that Mr. Hope, for all that he
affects the sturdy prose of to-day,
comes very near to being Shakespear
ean at times. The spirit of his work is
certainly Shakespearean. This Is not
a novel spirit, but it is one that is sel
dom dealt with successfully. The con
versation is witty in that whimsical
way of Hope's; the action, after the
first act of explanation, is vigorous; the
situations clinch in a very workmanlike
fashion for a fellow's first play; and the
eighteenth century atmosphe; > is serv
ed up with elegance and beauty.
There were waits and hitches in last
night's performance, but not enough to
conceal the excellence of Mr. Miller's
productionâ only enough to show that
the quick assimilation practiced by our
local weekly change of bill companies
does net come readily to actors who are
accustomed to long runs and plenty of
rehearsals. The faults were not vital,
however, and there is no reason why
they should exist after to-night or the
next, night. I cannot recall a single
part that is really miscast, and there
are several notable instances of indi
vidual excellence. Mr. Miller has a
princely part in Sir George, and
even with the occasional touches
of nervousness and insecurity that
marked his performance last night,
he was in my opinion, much more for
tunate than in "The Liars." Those
strenuous qualities of his that show
him at his best are brought into fre
quent play and he is always a picture
in deportment and an adept in what I
may call elocutionary tact.
In a part that is quite as difficult as
that of Rosalindâ more difficult in fact
when you realize that it has not the
tr^nipndons assistance of musical verse
- Mips Anglin was the superlative of
herself. Her work was distinguished
y delicacy, fragrance and an exquis
ite sense of humor. Mr. Morgan pre
sented a boldly outlined Lord Hsssen
den, splendid in its r.-mission of trick
heroics. Tt is a warmly human bit of
work. Mrs. Whiffen, Miss Burton. Mr.
Walcot and Mr. Adlem.in gave ad
mirable performances. The stage set
tings are in themselves a subject for
applause.
Alcazar.
"Frederick the Great." (he historical
comedy by George Foster Platt. was the
attraction at the Alcazar last nipht, and
it drew a crowded house. It met with
ready favor when presented by Mr. Lewis
I Morrison and his talented wife last sum-
I mer at this theater, and they were warmly
applauded last ni^ht. receiving several
' curtain calls. At the end of the second
â  act the stape looked like a florist* store

feld. The play is well mounted.
Orpheum.
The three new turns at the Orpheum
come in a bunch at the tall end of the
programme and are all received with good
favor by the crowd. The J'asqualis (Mr
and Mrs.), aided by local Mr. Abramoff
are the best of the lot in the prison scene
from "Faust." The town has had an over
dose of opera these last few months, so
the value of thin act may fairly be meas
ured by the applause that follows it
Twice was the big trio redemanded. Billle
and Willie Farrnll nre a team of colored
cakewalkers. Willie is a female. Their
singing doesn't amount to much, but their
dancing Is brisk and unusual. The Four
O*Learys, minus two, do some wild and
spectacular feats in tumbling. They are
a winning card. Francesca Redding has
a new sketch that shows her off to much
better advantage than the one of last
week, and the Aliases Melville and Stetson,
too, seoni to have found happier material
for the Becond week. Altogether tue show
is more Orpheumlike than it has been in
some little timo.
Grand Opera-House. â¢
. Perssp as "Mylea Na Cnppaleen" was the
leading figure in "The Lily of Killainey"
at the Grand Opera-house last night. It
fell to his lot to sing the best music in
the opera and that was the songs that
did not belong to it. namely: such old
favorites as "The Cruiskheen Lawn,'
"The Low-Backed Car" and "Believe Me
I Tf All Thoso Endearing Young Charms "
The hit of the oprra was "The Minstrel
Boy" by Hattie Belle Ladd as â¢Yin
Chute. Bertha Ricei as Mrs. Cregfln
Persse as Myles and W. Ooff. as Corrijyan!
All those gems, redolent of the old sod
were encored again and again. Edith
Mason made an attractive Eily O'Connor
and William Wolff as Da'jiny Mann
played the devoted villain to the life. But
the" brogue! Oh! it was awful: And
there was lack of local coloring when
half a dozen Sicilian bandits came upr.n
the stage with bits of flexible hose lor
blackthorns.
Tivoli.
"Orphans and Eurydice" was revived
for three performances in the Tivoli last
night, with the same cast that figured in
the piece several weeks ago. It is, as be
fore, a creditable production. On Thurs
day night the great Irish opera. "Shamus
O'Brien" takes the stage, with O'Sullivan
in his original creation of Shamus.
The Chutes.
At the Chutes Theater Ada Cosgrove, a
London Music Hall singer, made a hit
with her child impersonations and re
sponded* to four recalls. Armstrong and
O'Neill, an athletic trio, pave an amus
ing sketch. "Fun in a Club"; Mac Tunt
son sang pome pleasing soprano solos and
the La Kose brothers, comedy acrobats.

All physicians aprree that 'the element of

of disease.
Firm belief and confidence in a family
physician or the same confidence and
faith in a patent medicine have produced

This is especially true in nervous trou-

Nevertheless, the most common of all
diseases, indigestion and stomach trou-
bles, which in turn cause nervous dis-
eases, heart troubles, consumption, and
loss of flesh, require something besides
faith to cure.

DANGER IN SODA.
Serious Results Sometimes Follow Its
Excessive Use.
Common soda is all right in Its place.
nnd indispensable in the kitchen and for
cooking and washing purposes, but It was
never intended for a medicine, and people
i who use it as such will some day regret it.
We refer to the common use of soda to
j relieve heartburn or sour stomach, a habit
which thousands of people practice almost
daily and one which is fraught with dan-
j per; moreover, the soda only gives fm-
| porary relief and in the end the stomach
trouble is worse and worse.
The soda acts as a mechanical irritant
l to the walls of the stom.'ich and bowels,
and cases are on record where it aecumu-
. lated in the intestines, causing death by
Inflammation or peritonitis.
Dr. Harlanson recommends as the saf-
; est and surest cure for sour stomach
(acid dyspepsia! an excellent preparation

art's "Dyspepsia Tablets. These tablets

thousand and omÂ» pains and aches arising
from poor digestion? No, because perfect
digestion converts the fnod eaten into
pure blood, strong nerves and muscles,
and all the flesh a person needs to have
for health, symmetry anu beauty.
Every person knows whether or not his
or her digestion is what it should be, but
every person does not know what is the
safest and hest way to secure and pre-
serve a healthy condition of the digestive
organs. Tt is not done by the use of any
wonderful secret patent medicine, but by
the use of certain harmless digestive prin-
i-ipl^s. Which, taken at meals, w:ill digest
the food anyway, regardless of the weak
condition of the stomach.
Dr. Brooks recommends a combination
of vegetable essences, fruit salts, pure
asceptic pepsin and Golden Seal, prepared
in convenient tablet form, and sold by
druggists everywhere under the name of
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets.
These pleasant tasting tablets are to be
dissolved In the mouth after each meal,
and, mingling with the four! in the stom-
ach, digest it perfectly. There is nothing
wonderful about this. Any physician or
chemist knows that Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets will do this because repeatedly
tested and proved, and thousands of cured
dyspeptics have found it to be true also.
Dr. Harlandson states that these tablets
Increase flesh because they digest flesh-
forming food like eggs, meat, and ordi-
nary everyday food: for the same reason
they purify the blood and strengthen
weak nerves. In no other way can it be
done, because flesh, blood and nerves are
obtained from the food we eat.
Dr. Jennison once stated that he be-
lieved a 80-cent package of Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets would give more real bene-
fit that fifty dollars' worth of ordinary
doctor's fees.
These tablets can be found at any drug
store.

ARE YCU THIN?
Do You Want to Become FleshyP
A FEW SIMPLE RULES.
Flesh and No! Fat Is What Is Needed
What thin people want is flesh, and not
fat. To be symmetrical and properly pro-
portioned every person should havr a cer-
tain amount of flesh. To be plump does
not necessarily mean to he fat. F;it is un-
desirable; it clogrs and retards the action
of every muscle, interferes with the
healthy action of the heart and limps, and
when excessive predisposes to fatty de-
generation of vital organs, to say nothing
of the discomfort, more or less, resulting
from excosslve adipose tissue.
Common sense would suggest that if one
wishes to become fleshy and plump, the
thing: most needed would be flesh-forming
foods: in other words, albuminous foods
like eggs, beef, oatmeal, etc. The kin. ls
of food that make flesh are the foods that
form the greater part of our dally bill of
fare.
Now, the only reason so many people
remain thin is because their stomachs do
not properly and completely digest and
assimilate the llesh-forming beefsteak and
eggs we eat every day.
There are thousands of such people, and
they are really dyspeptic, although they
may not suffer any particular pain
or inconvenience from their stomachs. Tf
such persons would tak<\ with their
meals, some preparation like Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets, the food would be
quickly digested, and the proper degree of
plumpness very soon secured, because
these tablets are prepared exactly for
that purpose. They Will digest every va-
riety of flesh-forming fond, which Is tho
sole reason why they s.i quickly build up
and strengthen thin, dyspeptic m"n and
women.
Stuart's Dyspe- ia Tablets cure dyspep-
sia anrl every form of indigestion on thin
common sense plan, that they digest the
food promptly, Riving strength to every
nerve and organ of the body, while at the
same time the stomach has a chance tr>
rest and recover its natural vi<~or. Noth-
ing further is required to cure any stom-
ach trouble, or to make thin, dyspeptic
people strong, plump and welL

tured by F. A. Stuart Co., Marshall.

A VICTORY FOR THE PUBLIC.
WITH the full satisfaction resulting from the con
-3s of victory achieved for the public
welfare after a hard-fought contest, The Call
tes the people of San Francisco upon the
the long controversy over the
â¢'corkscrew" franchise.
'] â  the franchise upon the terms re
:pori : the committee, and these are exactly the
â¢ which The Call has contended. There was
ftp compromise on a single issue. It was a clear,
â :\ -cut victory for the municipality against the
ning and the aggressive greed of the monopoly.
â  â '..'â . The preservation of the rights of the public was not
â nod without a fight The struggle over the Du
et loop resulted in the defeat of that part cf
.- the monopoly scheme.
.'.'. An important part of the victory is the concession
won from the Market-street Company that the fran

. .company agrees to bid at least the minimum percent-
: the gn.-s receipts a- required by the new
This concession is also a part of the issue
: as made up by The Call, for as was stated yesterday:
' It Was insisted by The Call, which merely expressed
sound public opinion in an intelligible way, that unless
i.i'l: -;â  isable no new franchise whatever should be

: terests of business men and others who

c should be offered for sale at once under the

treet Company to bid for it under some, at
â¢â . of the provisions of the new charter.
"i : . Issue is now satisfactorily settled. The fight
for the-people as made by The Call has been won at
every point, and the contested franchise, instead of
being an injury, will prove a benefit to the community.
THE DEWEY MONUMENT FUND.
y: "CONTRIBUTIONS to the Dewey monument
â¢i\ .'â â .:'â â  fund for the week ending last Friday amounted
. .v*<^ .to the hahdosme total of $2700. Two of the sub
scriptions are for $500 each, two for $250 each and
twelve for $100 each. The aggregate of the subscrip
tions to the date of the last report is $32,419, or very
nearly one-third of the sum required to erect the
monument upon the scale desired.
Up to this time the contributions have come almost
exclusively from San Francisco. That was to be ex
pected, and it is right it should be so, for the move
ment had its origin in this city, and while it aims tc
provide a monument which shall represent the senti
ment of nil California, San Francisco must, of course
take the lead in providing the necessary funds.
Now that there has been subscribed in the city a
sum sufficient to assure the speedy success of the en
terprise contributions from other sections of the State
may be confidently looked for. Communications pub
lished in The Call from day to day during the past
week from Mayors of various cities give ample evi
dence of the favor with which the patriotic and artis
tic enterprise is regarded. The approval of the pro
ject is, in fact, well nigh universal, and when the whole
of the desired $100,000 has been raised it will be found
â  that the contributions have come from all parts of the
State and from all classes of the people.
. It is not desirable that the fund should be raised
by large contributions only. The monument is to rep
resent the appreciation a great people have of a great
victory which has vastly increased the prestige of
their country, and therefore the contributions to it
should include the dollar of the workingman as well
as the larger but not more loyal or more liberal gift
of the capitalist.
Nearly one-third of the sum needed is now sub
scribed. This week will add another notable amount
to the increasing sum. California will show forth the
patriotism of her people. Dewey shall have his monu
ment.
The Czar's Peace Conference is trying to deter

REPUDIATED DEMOCRATIC TRUST.
THE Democratic Committee of One Hundred
was an original trust, invented and supported
' by the Examiner. Its theory w.as the substitu
tion of one-man power for the representative prin
ciple, regarded as fundamental in our American insti
tutions. This was and is the predominant character
istic of Mr. J. D. Phelan, who, while catering
with a certain degree of raw skill to special interests
in his search for popularity and influence, has unerr
ingly disregarded the underlying conception of gov
ernment for and by and of the people.
This party anachronism was the Democratic ma
chine in the last campaign. Produced and fondled
by the Examiner, while catering to the socialistic ele
ments of our population, it was supposed to incarnate
all the virtues attributed sometimes to aristocracies.
The unity from which its appointment proceeded gave
to it a tinge of imperialism. But the lofty and ab
stract independence of its members and their intense
egotism in their pretentious role of political reform
ers raised them to such a height of sublimity that
ordinary Democratic voters gazed upon them with
an awe that was only matched by their determina
tion to pull them down from their pedestal, inscribed
with the blended names of the Examiner and of Mr.
Phelan.
They appointed the Democratic Municipal Conven
tion, and, on the present authority of the Examiner,
had about a quarter of their own number nominated
for office, with the result that, while Mr. Phelan was
saved by the skin of his teeth and by sacrificing every
one else for himself, the ticket and the fusion it rep
resented were literally slaughtered at the polls.
But the Committee of One Hundred, the Exam
iner and Mr. J. D. Phelan survived. Like the fossil
ized Democrats of Kentucky, they actually announce
their own existence. But what a change in yieir
mutual relations has been revealed! It seems that,
while the Republicans, who are perpetually assailed
by the Examiner as the supporters of every form of
injurious monopoly, have been struggling, and with
a fair prospect of success, for such a thoroughly popu
lar representation of respectability, intelligence and
influence in their municipal convention as could not
fail to command public approval, the Democratic Com
mittee of One Hundred has not only formalized its
rule of self-perpetuation but has determined to reduce
its relations to the masses to the simplest and most
avowed mode of political bossism.
It is of course understood that each member of the
Committee of One Hundred is a candidate in waiting.
If the Examiner's suggestion be accepted and a reso
lution of non-candidacy be adopted, that can be easily
handled by the continuance of last year's policy and
a succession of resignations may be anticipated. But
a Campaign Committee of Twenty has also been ap- \
pointed, so that the power of control may be further j
concentrated, and they are to constitute an active
oligarchy within or on behalf of the aristocratic hun
dred. This simultaneous contraction and expansion,
however, appears to be only a part of the game. As
a great many clubs have been organized in the
eighteen Assembly districts, each presumptively an
exponent of Mr. Phelan's inordinate ambition, the
plan of autocratic government might fail, unless a
mode of natural or unnatural selection were adopted.
Mr. J. D. Maxwell hit the nail on the head. He pro
poses that the Campaign Committee designate what
the Examiner calls '"an authentic club," but what the
inventor of the scheme and his associates described as
'"an official club," which should bear the stamp of
aristocratic indofsement within each Asembly dis- 1
trict.
The simplicity of Mr. Maxwell's plan and its adap
tation to the scheme of political management for
which the Examiner and Mr. Phelan are mutually
responsible certainly commend it to the favorable
consideration of the fusion or Phelan Democracy.
But there are some obstreperous Democrats who have
the audacity to demand the election of a Democratic
municipal convention "by primary precincts," instead
of through the more easily handled Assembly dis
tricts. A Mr. Larry Conlan. who has been known
as the physical leader of the resuscitated blind boss
who so long guided the local Democracy by a string,
is actually malignant in his assertion of the superiority
of the Democrats of Minna, Stevenson, Jessie and
Rrannan streets to the specialized associates of Mr.
Maxwell.
There is certainly a very pretty Democratic or fu
sion quarrel actually raging. Quiet Republicans,
watchful within their own party, can look on with
equanimity. But the tattitude of the Examiner excites
general interest. Why, like Saturn, does it seek to
devour its own offspring? Why does it now practi
cally assail the system it inaugurated? What is the
real milk in this new cocoanut? Have the Examiner
and Mr. Phelan been divorced and has the bond or
their union been violently disrupted or are they both
in the revolutionary movement of which Mr. Larry
Conlan is a forcible interpreter? These are questions
tc which answers will have to be made, although
probably too late to serve any purpose beyond the
gratification of curiosity.
The proceedings of to-night will be observed with- ,
out enthusiasm but with a certain languid interest.
It really appears that the Examiner is about to cease
from its assumed vocation as a factor in Democratic
aft airs.
THE DOLLAR LIMIT PLEDGE.
rROM the extent to which the estimates of the
various departments of the city and county ;
government exceed for the fiscal year those of
the last one it is evident the Supervisors will have to
exercise no little courage to stand by their pledges to
the people an<l restrict the taxation to nn amount not
j exceeding $1 upon an assessed valuation of $350,
--000,000.
A detailed review of the subject given in The Call
of Sunday shows that the increase in the estimates
of the coming year are: For the schools, $59,420; for
streets, $212,130; for Golden Gate Park, $102,000; for ,
the Sheriff's office, $97,720; for the City and Comity
Hospital, $35,000; for fire alarm telegraph, $59,350;
for the County Clerk's office, $17,000. These do not
represent all the increase the estimates will call for,
as it is fairly certain that in some departments, that
j of health for example, there will be a request for ad- !
ditional allowances.
In the aggregate the estimates, as stated, show an j
increase of $582,800 over those of the present year.
There is, however, a deduction to be made for the
decrease in the estimates for elections, which are
$106,100 less than those of last year. Making that de
duction, the net increase in the estimates reaches the
sum of $476,700, an amount which constitutes a con
j siderable percentage upon the total revenues of the
I cit y-
To raise the amount of money required for the esti- \
mates of last year there was imposed a tax of $1.31.20
on a valuation of $350,000,000. That is to say, to meet
estimates much lower than those now made it was ,
necessary last year to impose a rate. of taxation about
25 per cent higher than the one to which the Mayor
and the Supervisors are pledged. To accomplish the
work of the municipality upon the basis proposed will i
require therefore a strict and sagacious economy, but
THE SAX rKAXCISCO CALL, TUESDAY. JUKE 27, 1899.
by the exercise of that economy it can be accom
plished.
The dollar limit of taxation levied upon an assess
ment not to exceed $350,000,000 has long been desired
in San Francisco. In the last campaign all parties
pledged their candidates to uphold the desired rate
and oppose any attempt to fix a higher one. Accord
ingly the Mayor and the Supervisors, no matter by
what party elected, are now equally bound to fix the
tax rate at a sum not exceeding that amount. The
pledges made in the campaign have since been re
newed by the Mayor and a majority of the Supervi
sors in interviews with The Call. The public, there
fore, has a right to expect them to grapple earnestly
with the problem before them, to stand firm for the
welfare of the people and uphold their own repeated
assurances that the city can be well and efficiently
administered with a tax rate not exceeding the amount
named.
THE NEW FRENCH CABINET.
rRANCE has safely passed the crisis brought
about by the resignation of the Dupuy Minis
try and a new Cabinet has taken office and as
sumed the responsibility of directing the affairs of the
country during the turmoil expected to result from
the arrival of Dreyfus to undergo a new trial.
The crisis was probably by no means so great as it
appeared from the reports. In France, as in every
other country, there is a large body of citizens who
care very little about the struggles of politicians, and
who do not get excited whenever one set of officials
go out of office to make way for another set. More
over, a Ministerial crisis in France is not a serious
affair. Since the present Chamber of Deputies was
elected, a year ago last May, three Premiers have
been compelled to resign, and on ea,ch occasion there
was great excitement in official circles and no disturb
ance at all among the people. The new Cabinet will
probably hold its own for about six months. Then
there will be another flurry among the Deputies,
another crisis and another Cabinet.
The inability of any Premier to hold office very
loi.g is due to the fact that no party has a clear
majority in the Chamber of Deputies. Each succes
sive aspirant for the office has, therefore, to organize
a fusion party to enable him to form a Cabinet. Fu
sions, however, are never durable. The leaders of
each faction entering such combinations expect' to
derive profit from them, and when the new Premier
has finished the distribution of offices, trouble begins.
The disappointed members of the fusion fall away
from him and begin to fuse with the opposition, and
some fine day the Premier finds he has no longer a
majority at his back and has to step down and out.
All these storms and changes in officialdom have
no more effect upon the real government of France
than winds and waves have upon the great movements
of the sea. They make a noisy commotion on the sur
face of things, but the undercurrent of administration
is not disturbed. Taxes are collected regularly, the
army, navy, judiciary and all branches of civil service
are maintained, the police continue to make arrests,
and government goes very much as if there had been
no crisis at all.
Everybody will wish the new Premier, M. Waldeck-
Rousseau, success. He has a pretty goo.'d mouth-fill
ing name and his reputation as a patriot statesman is
high. He merits all the congratulations that will be
given him on his accession to power, and when along
about Christmas time his turn comes to give way to a
crisis he will be again deserving of congratulations
on his relief from the burdens of government in time
to enjoy the holidays.
ELECTRIC COHESION.
'HJXPERIMENTS recently made at the Royal
Institute in London by Professor Oliver Lodge
â * are reported to have completely demonstrated
that the passage of an electric current through
smoke, fog or mist will cause the particles of mois
ture or of smoke to precipitate, or "cohere," and fall
to the earth. The experiment at the institute lecture
was made with magnesium smoke. Such fumes re
quire ordinarily a long time to disperse, but it" is
said that as soon as a charge of electricity was sent
through the jar in which they were confined the air
began to clear at once, the smoke particles uniting
and falling in the form of a white snow of magnesia.
The explanation of the phenomenon is said by Pro
fessor Lodge to be as yet beyond our scientific
knowledge. We know at present no more than the
fact that electricity causes cohesion of any particles
that may be floating in the atmosphere. Even that
limited knowledge, however, is expected to be of
considerable use to civilization.
Professor Lodge is quoted as saying the experi
ment does not afford any reasonable ground for ex
pecting it will result in the invention of a method of
eliminating the "smoke nuisance" of great cities. He
does believe, however, it may lead to the adoption
of some method by which any kind of fog. whether
sea fog or a fog arising from the ground, may be
dispersed. "A Scotch mist," he said, ''can be turned
into rain by a suitable discharge of electricity, and or
dinary rain can be changed into the large drops of a
thunder shower by the electric discharge of the light
ning flash. The reason for the size of the drops is
that, owing to the incident of electric 'cohesion,' the
drops are attracted to one another and form conglom
erate drops."
The statement of the professor suggests that the
discovery may be of use to the people of ths semi
arid districts of the United States in their various
rain-producing experiments. There are a good many
sections where the atmosphere holds a quantity of
moisture abundant for the needs of plant life if only
it could be made to fall in the form of rain. All
such attempts thus far have been futile. Electrical
force is becoming a comparatively cheap energy,
easily produced where there is either fuel or water
power, and it will be worth while for some American
inventor to set his wits to work to see if the new
discovery in science may not be made effective for
some such use.
A party of visionary Stocktonites have returned
from a fruitless cruise of seven years in search of
pirates' gold. The party sailed in the appropriately
named yacht, the Hayseed. There is likely to be an
exodus of gold-brick rrten from this city to Stockton.
Ex-Governor Stone of Missouri, the acting chair
man of the Democratic National Committee, is look
ing for a national "organ." He might make a good
beginning with William Jennings Bryan, who is
splendidly qualified to furnish the bellows.
Los Angeles wants all of the big political conven
tions of next year. She might have them and a bonus
to boot if she would promise not to give us another

DR. McNAUGHTON TELLS
HIS STORY OF CHARGES
DR. JAMES McNAUGH
TOX has arrived on the
scene and announces his
readiness to refute the charges
against his ability, morality and
integrity, now being investigated
by the Alumni Association of the
San Jose Normal School. These
charges have been printed in full
by The Call and interviews have
been published with prominent
citizens of Council Bluffs, la.,
where the basis of the charges is
said to have been laid. In justice
to Dr. McXaughton, therefore,
this paper has allowed him to
make his statement of the case.
Dr. James McXaughton, principal
elect of the State Normal School at San
Jose, has arrived Tn the city and is al
ready engaged in preparations to refute
the charges against him now being in
vestigated by a committee of the
Alumni Association of the institution to
which he has been appointed. Dr. Mc-
Naughton got in yesterday morning
from Tempe, Ariz., and is stopping at
the Grand Hotel, where he will remain
until he goes to San Jose to enter upon
his new duties.
The accused principal professes to
have no fear of the outcome of the
alumni Investigation. He says, as he
has .said in previous interviews, that
the charges against him are anonymous
and have been made against him in the
same form time and again and time
and again refuted. In support of this
assertion, he produces a bundle of man
uscript half a foot high, consisting of
letters from former professional and
business associates testifying to his
higiTcharaeter; affidavits from numer
ous persons denyiner absolutely the
charges in former circulars; and reso
lutions from executive boards of two
school governments testifying that the
accusations, after full investigation,
have been proven groundless.
"When a man has been pursued as I
have been," said Dr. McNaughton, "he
finds it well to come prepared."
The accused principal does not pro
pose to put in this proof before the
Alumni Association. He thinks that the
best plan will be to allow the associa
tion to sift the matter and then, if it
finds that there is ground for the
charges and makes them formally to
the Trustees of the Normal School, he
will come forward to refute them. He
purposes, however, while the Alumni
Association is going along with its
work, to let no grass grow under his
feet. In justice to himself, he says,
he wishes that the members of the
Board of Normal Trustees should be
come familiar with the history of the
charges and the fate that has befallen
them, and for this reason will submit
what documents he has personally to
each Trustee he can reach within the
week that intervenes before he as
sumes the duties of his new position.
In pursuance of this plan Dr. Mc-
Naughton called yesterday morning
upon State Senator Leavitt and sub
mitted his papers. He will reach the
others as quickly as possible.
"These charges," said Dr. McNaugh
ton yesterday, "are not new and they
are not true, but they are annoying.
A brief history of them will not be out
of place. I had been unanimously re
elected Superintendent of Schools at
Council Bluffs in May, 1890, as I had
been for seven years before. In Au
gust, 1890, the principal of the High
School, a man addicted to the free use
of liquor, refused to respond to require
ments of the School Board and was
dismissed. Members Lucius Wells and
John Schoentgen of the School Board,
his special friends and associates, were
offended at the action of the majority
and declared that since the principal of
the High School was dismissed I should
be dismissed also, they assuming that
because I did not approve of the con
duct of the principal, that the board
would be divided while I remained. Mr.
Wells said after his faction had asked
me to resign: 'I believe Professor Mc-
Naughton does not want to throw ob
stacles in the way of the schools; he
is an innocent victim.' dr. Schoent
gen said: 'I have the utmost .respect
for Professor McNaughton; I have
nothing to say against him.'
"Immediately thereafter they em
ployed attorneys, who formulated
charges, securing the statements in
questionable ways, on which the said
charges are purported to be based.
There was never an opportunity given
me by that board to be heard on these
charges before a tribunal having au
thority to pass upon their validity, and
at no time was there a majority of the
board willing to give these charges any
official recognition on account of the
notorious fact that they were false and
malicious and trumped up as a justifi
cation for asking for my dismissal, an
act that a great majority of the people
of Council Bluffs were severely censur
ing. Neither was there a majority of
the board willing to permit these men
to sit as judges of the validity of the
charges, which they themselves had
been instrumental in bringing.
"Mr. Hunter of the School Board al
lied himself to Wells and Schosntgen
for reasons unknown to me, thus caus
ing the board to stand three against
three on all questions, and thus pre~
venting an official vindication.
"The position taken in this matter by
James A. Edwards in the December
number of the lowa Normal Monthly,
he to!d to me and others, was due to
intimidation from Wells and Schoent
gen.
"I resigned my position at Council
Bluffs not because of the charges, but
because my wife's health was rapidly
sinking under the torments of my per
secutors and om* family physician de
manded that she be relieved; the
schools were rapidly becoming demor
alized under the personal direction of
"Wells and Schoentgen; there was no
further hope of vindication with half
of the board devoting their time and
energies planning devices to remove
me; there could be no hope of re-elec
tion the ensuing year, since at the next
election the terms of the three hostile
members would not have expired; I
was unable to obtain my salary with
out process of law; I was obliged to re
tain an attorney at no small expense;
I had opportunity for congenial work
where I hoped to be free from persecu
tion."
From Council Bluffs Dr. McNaughton
wont to Mayville, N. D., at the solicita
tion of the State Superintendent of
Schools, John Ogden, and took the po
sitions of City Superintendent of
Schools and principal of the Normal
School. He occupied these places
about two years before he heard of the
Council Bluffs charges again. Then
they were presented to the board un
der which he was working and made
the subject of investigation by each.
"The city board," said Dr. McNaugh
ton yesterday, "took three weeks in its
investigations and then adopted reso
lutions completely exonerating me and
finding- the charges groundless. The
Normal School Trustees took longer
time to investigate, but after four
months of it they adopted similar reso
lutions. I have a copy of them here.
They read:
Resolutions of the board of manage
ment of the State Normal School at
Mayville, N. D., passed unanimously
at a meeting of the board held Novem
ber 25. 1892:
Whereas, this board has received a
communication from J. P. Haber of
this city calling attention to a letter
purporting to have bten written to him
by one Lucius Wells of Council Bluffs,
lowa, and making certain charges
against Dr. James McNaughton, and
also an alleged copy of said letter;
and has also received from saiu J. P.
Haber a copy of the lowa Normal
Monthly issued in December, 1890, in
which is printed and published an
article making certain charges against
Dr. McXaughton; and whereas, the
said J. P. Haber has read and shown
to Hon. E. M. Paulson, president of
the board, a letter purporting to have
been written by one James A. Ed
wards of Dubuque, lowa, and. making
certain other charges against Dr. Mc-
Naughton; and whereas, we have
carefully considered all these charges
and investigated all the allegations
contained therein and have become
satisfied that they are malicious, false
and without foundation in fact; there
fore be it
Resolved, That this board have and
hereby desires to express full confi
dence in the abilities of Dr. James Mc-
Naughton as iin educator, in his integ
rity as a business man, and in his
character as an upright, and conscien
tious gentleman. Further, we hereby
express our disbelief in all the charges
and innuendoes contained in the afore
said magazine article and letters re
ceived.
Dr. McNaughton says he left May
ville a year after the charges had been
disposed of, for the reason that the
Legislature' had failed to make appro
priations for the conduct of the schools.
Since that time he has been at Tempe,
Ariz., in charge of the Normal School.
"The charges followed me even
there," continued Dr. McNaughton,
"copies of the lowa Normal Monthly
containing them having been forward
ed by some interested parties. They
were circulated at different time's
among the Board of Trustees, but no
Trustee could be found who considered
them worth investigating. I remained
in Arizona at the head of the Tempe
school under four Governors and under
six Boards of Trustees, and when I
handed in my resignation in order to
come to California the board unani
mously passed resolutions regretting
my departure, stating that my admin
istration of the affairs of the institu
tion had been pre-eminently progres
sive, and concluding with the opinion
that my work had had a good influence
throughout the Territory..
"Jte I said before, it is annoying to
have these same old charges, baseless
and malicious as they are, digged up
and gone all over again. However, I
have no objection to the investigation
taken in hand by the Alumni Associa
tion. I do not know what it will find,
but if, with the materials it has in
hand, it feels compelled to file charges
against me with the Board of Trus
tees, I shall then ask the privilige of
putting in my refutation, which is at
hand, full and complete. It seems to
me that the fact that the School Board
of Council Bluffs could not be induced
to take up the charges; that two school
boards in North Dakota did take them
up and prove them groundless; and
that no Arizona board would consider
them at all, should be enough to deter
any person or association from prob
ing into them. However, as I have said
before, I have no objection, except on
the ground of annoyance, to any pro
cedure the Alumni Association may
take; and I am as sure as I am sit
ting here that the result of any investi
gation will be another vindication for
me.
"Now, in regard to the charges them
selves, which have been distributed
broadcast, I want to say that there la
no one of them that will hold water.
My work in the various schools to
which I have been attached and th
commendations I have received should
settle once for all my qualification am
competency as a pedagogue. The ii.
nuendo as to Tny immorality is too ar>
surd for mention, but it might be wel!
to say in this connection that prior to
my departure from Council Bluffs I re
ceived unsolicited from the pastor i
every church in the city a letter vouch
ing for my integrity of character. Sine*
1 have left that city I have had letter ;
from five of the gentlemen who? -.
names were signed to the charges to
the effect that my character was of
the best. F. M. Hunter, one of the
School Board in lowa who oppust-d me,
wrote a letter to the Board of Trus
tees of the North Dakota school, in
which he vindicated me. It reads:
He made a strong defense, in <he
fight which was waged against h;m,
and as the board was equally di\
for and against him the contest
came very bitter and persona!, and
many things were said and done wl
never would have been thought of had
the contest been an ordinary one.
While the doctor was connected with
our schools he accomplished a great
work and- was greatly instrumental in
elevating them to the good standard
they are to-day, of which we are all
prmd, but he had done all the good
that lay in his power, and on that ac
count I believed a change desirable.
I took pains to investigate his moral
character and conduct between man
and man. I am pleased to say his
character was above reproach. I might
say that the personal feeling between
him and me is not very congenial. We
have not recognized each other for
nearly two years, although we have
met upon the streets and at large
gatherings, but it is my desire to do
him that justice which is due every
man in thu community in which he re"
sides.
"As the man who submitted his name
for the principalship." paid Senator
Leavitt yesterday afternoon, "I think
that Dr. McNaughton is taking the
right course. I say this, however, with
out having: made any particular inves
tigation of the charges against him or
the proofs he says he has and which he
submitted this morning for my inspec
tion. The matter seems to be for the
present in the hands of the Alumni As
sociation. If it should formulate the
charges the Board of Trustees will cer
tainly hear them and Dr. McNaughton.
If it does not, why I suppose the mat
ter will drop.
"I have heard some comment con
cerning the fart that the board se
lected an outsider like Dr. McNaugh
ton instead of a resident of the State
of California. The reason they did so
was that outside of the. two local can
didates, Messrs. Ohilds and Randall of
San Jose, they could not find a man in
the State completely fitted for the posi
tion. For that reason they went out
side. The local candidates seemed ob
jectionable to the board for the reason
that each was so strongly backed by a
following of friends the result of the
election of either would have left a bit
terness still there and that would have
been bad for the school."

AT BRANCH COUNTY JAIL
Louis Kirschbaum Lying at the
Door of Death.

Now in the City Prison -Cap am Otto Lemcke
Tells the Sio v of the Fight
LOUIS KIRSCHBAUM, a guard at
Branch County Jail No. 3, is
lying- in the shadow of death in
the German Hospital. Burgeons
of the institute and whitecapped
nurses are beside his bed await
inifestatlons of returning reason,
â¢ they may properly diagnose his
hurta and prognos.> their results, \vh!l<
'he dead watch speculates as to
whether it will nave other duties to
â¢1 or not In the meantime Frank
McFarland, Assistant Superintendent
of the woman's branch, occupies a cell
in the City Prison awaiting the out
come of Kirschbaum's injuries, for on
the outcome rests the chares that will
be placed opp< Bite his name.
For many we.-ks Kirschbaum. the <'.y
--ing man, and McFarland have b^en on
unfriendly terms. Not a day passed at
the lngleside Prison that did not see
the?e men plotting against each other.
Which was to blame none carts to
say, but all agree that McFarland med
dled in affairs Th- Interest in which
was not all bis own.
Sunday night the guards were placed
at their stations, and with measured
pace they covered the cells under thMr
care. Shortly after 6 o'clock Kirsch
baum was called from his duty and was
detailed on the office watch, his duties
OFFICIALS IN DEADLY COMBAT AT THE BRANCH COUNTY JAIL
confining him to official headquarters j
when not at the entrance gate receiv
ing the applications of visitors, who,
In their anxiety to visit some friend or
relative, called at the prison after
nightfall. On this watch Kirschbaum
and McFarland were thrown together â
an unfortunate circumstance.
Shortly after 7 o'clock Captain of the
Ouard and Superintendent of the
Woman's Department Otto Lemcke re
to his apartments, but later was
; by the matron on a matter of
ess. Just as he reached the
m's apartments his attention was
â¢..l by boisterous talking in the
of the Jail, but before he ar
-1 there the sounds of a hand-to
encounter echoed through the big
>ng.
itain Lemcke hurried to the office,
le he threw open the door Kirsch
baum and McFarland were standing as
in the ring, swinging with
Lemcke rushed between
them, and when they saw that they
were | each fell back to await,
it seemed, the announcement of the i
referee. Si â¢ tendeni Leincke im
mediately ordered the men to attend to
duty, and McFarland promptly re- j
>ut Kirschbaum did not seem
to realize hia position. He took a seat
In the office, and before many minutes
had passed v. ;.,s in a comatose condi
tion. Captain Lemcke endeavored to
rouse him, and when he found that his
efforts were without aval] he called
some of tho guards and they removed
The injured man to his apartments.
Thinking that Kirschbaum was slm
ply suffering from temporary exhaus- â 
tion, Captain Lemcke applied the u.<ua!
ratives, but at daylight the injured
i was in the same condition. In
consequence it was decided best to
summon a physician, and <Dr. Bau
meister was called to the jail. After a
ry examination of the patient Dr,
Baumeister decided that, inasmuch as
the condition of the jail would not ad
f thorough treatment of the pa
tient, it was better to remove him to
the German Hospital. Last evening at
5 o'clock, in consequence, the prison
ran bearing the unconscious body of
Kirschbaum left the prison and pro
led to the hospital.
The injured man was taken immedi
ately into th 3 operating room and the
labor of diagnosing his case began.
No facts were placed in the possession
of the surgeons upon vvhicn to work,
and the result was that they made a
complete examination of his entire
body, finally locating the injury nn the
left side of the skull just at the point
fit which the temporal and parietal
bones Join, or, in the language of the
layman, just above the left temple.
The patient's head was Bhaved and an
Ice pack placed upon the vmtnd to
allay the Inflammation. This over, he
was removed to a separate room, placed
upon a cot and left to the care of a
corps of whispering nurses. Occasion
ally a physician would enter th>* apart
ment, carefully note thÂ» changes in th<>
condition of the patient and retire.
This morning at 6 o'clock, if no change
for the better is noted, unfortunate
Kirschbaum will again be wheeled tv
th<* operating room and the k>=-en
edged dulls will remove his skull
just above the injury.
Last night, shortly aftpr 8 o'clock.
when sume friends visited him. he
turned on Ms cot as they entered and
lisped who arc all these people?"
Immediately again reason forsook him.
his eyes rolled from side to s;d<- and
he grasped at the coverletE In h.s pain.
The v hite-capped nurses shook their
heads, the physicians bent over him
without words and turned to oth*r
cases demanding their attention. Such
is the condition of the patient, and
whether or not murder is to be charged
to his assailant remains to be seen.
There is hut one account of the as
; sault. and that is given by Captain
uemcke. He says that bad blood hts
existed between the men fur some time
past. They met in the office, harsh
words were passed and at the end
Kirschbaum was bereft of reason. Not
withstanding the statement of th^ <r>r
man Hospital surgeons, Lemcke la of
! the opinion that McFarland lid â  |
j us'"- a club or other instrument with
; which to subjugate his enemy. The
captain does not know whether or not
j the Injured man was jammed againsi
the office railing, but this is immaterial.
If Kirschbaum dies, McFarland must
answer for the murder.
Shortly after the fight occurred in
which Kirschbaum was so seriously in
jured Sheriff Martin was apprised of
the farts. He telephoned to the Jail
and asked that McFarland be sent to
hi? office. In due time McFarland ap
peared, and then in answer to a de
mand made by Captain Bohen he was
turned over to the police. Ho was im
mediately taken to the prison and his
name placed upon the detinue book,
where it will be kept until the result,
of Kirschbaum'B injuries are known.
The sympathies of the officials in the
Sheriff's office are with the injured
man, although it is said that he
talked the loudest just prior to the fight
which resulted in his supposed fatal in
juries. They say that the dismissal of
James Gaitley, first appointed superin
tendent of the woman's department by
Sheriff Martin, was caused by under
hand wt.-rk on the part of McFarland.
They say that he was alway antagonis
tic to those around him and his present
predicament is no surprise to all who
know him and studied his personality.
McFarland did not seem to be partic
ularly disturbed as he prepared for a
night's sleep In his cell. He evaded
every question put to him and finally
refused altogether to talk to his inter
viewers, saying that he did not wish
to compromise himself until he had
seen an attorney.

DOLLIE AND
TRIXIE FOUGHT
TO A FINISH
War to the Knife in
the Thalia.
TRIXIE SERIOUSLY INJURED
â + â
A BREACH OF PROFESSIONAL ET
IQUETTE CAUSED TROUBLE.
Â»
Dollie Enticed Trixie's Good Friend
Away and Then Finally As
saulted Her Friend With
a Beer Mug.
James Schwartz, the proprietor of the
i Thalia, has troubles of hie own. and. In
! cidentally, it may be said that just at
: present he is worrying over the troubles
of some other people. The Thalia, which
Is one of the well-known resorts of the
city, is situated at the junction of Market
and Turk streets. It is one of the cheap
j variety houses along the city's main
! thoroughfare. Schwartz's license for the
! past year is about to expire, and in a
j short while he is to appear before the
j Police Commissioners to apply for a per;
| mit to renew it. These permits are only
i granted upon the stipulation that the
i place shall be run In an orderly manner.
; Schwartz employs a special policeman,
: hut he i.- not keep very good order in
; the TJialia. and more than one complaint
: has been made about the resort.
Last Saturday night murder most foul
; was narrowly averted. Two of the deni
al * o'" i 'â .Â»â â¢ pla<e, Tilxle Cokman and Dol
lie Kellogg, who do a few fantastic steps
and warble a few bars with their nasal
falsettos" became engaged In an alterca
tion, with the result that the former now
lies at her home on Powell street in a crit
ical condition, and. Indeed, it will be no
surprise if another murder has to be
charged id the word of such ques
â  tionable Institutions. Trixle and Dollie
up to Saturday night were friends. Be
; tween their turns and after the perform
' ance the two women were wOnt to use
their wiles in enticing men into the boxes
in the rear of the stage for the purpose of
i drinking and having a good time gener
â  ally. On Saturday night Trlxie succeeded
in 'landing a "sucker, who was rounding
; the beers up at the rate of M a "hot." I 'â¢ l
-1 lie became envious >>/ Trixie's snap, and
I she entered the box and began to parade
; her charms with the result that the fickle
! "sucker" forsook Trixie and followed Dol
'â  lie
; Blind with rage and jealousy. Trixie
went to Schwartz and complained of Dol
j He's breach of professional etiquette.
1 Schwartz decided mat the â¢â¢farmer" be
longed to Trixie and that Doll!* 1 would
have to give him up. Thus the matter
was temporarily adjusted, but Dollie was
. out for blood, so when Trixie had finished
with the "greeny" she began to tell her
friend just what she thought of her. One
word led to another and the two live art
ists mixed it. Tht> hair flew and also the
blood, while the air was thick with small
patches of skin. Schwartz and the entire
male help <>f the Thalia labored for an
hour before they succeeded in separating
the two women. Finally peace was re
stored, and while Trixie was replacing an
eye Pollit; went into her dressing room
and returned wiÂ£h a beer mug. She made
for Trixie, and before Schwartz and the
other m<n could Interfere she dealt her
former friend a severe blow over the head,
breaking the mug. The men grabbed her,
but she managed to strike Trixie again,
inflicting a deep cut on the head and one
over her eye. The woman sunk to the
ground unconscious and the blood spurted
in streams from her wounds.
A physician was summoned and he la
bored over the injured woman for some
time before ho could restore her to con
sciousness. Finally she was removed to
her home. Schwartz issued orders to his
employe?, under the penalty of dismissal.
not to say a word about the affair, as he
was afraid if It became known he might
have some trouble in getting the Police
Commissioners to renew his license. The
affair has been kept quiet up to yesterday,
when some of the friends of Trixie, who
had loarnc-d of the cause of her critical
condition, gave the story away.

DID DEATH COME IN
A PHYSICIAN'S GUISE
Suspicious Circumstances Surround
John Kehien beck's Demise.
Dr. C. C. J. Wache dorf, Attendant Physician and Room
mate of the Deceased, He.il by Police â Money
Affords a Possible Motive for Crime.
JOHN* KEHLENBECK. a native of
Germany and a teamster about 36
years of age, died yesteraav morn
ing at Sin's Jessie street under cir
cumstances which have invoked a
police investigation. Yesterday afternoon I
his roommate. Dr. C. C. J. Wachendorf,
who attended him during his final illness,
was placed under arrest and will be de
tained pending further investigation. The
testimony of several friends and acquain- i
tances of the dead man would indicate '
that he was possessed of considerable
money a short time before his death,
while but an insignificant amount .'was !
found among his effects by the Coroner.
Kehlenbeck has been empio;*eu d.3 a
teamster by several firms in this city. He
met Dr. Wachendorf about two weetcs
ago and was treated by him. The treat
ment in some cases consisted of minis- ;
trations of Indian hemp and chloroform.
Soon after Wachendorf took, his patient '
the latter became seriously 111 and he
called to his assistance Dr. Fehlen. This
physician diagnosed the case of the suf
ferer, found him delirious and boisterous j
and administered chloroform. On â¢he
following morning he was in a fair con
dition.
Yesterday morning about 1 o'clock Dr. j
Fehlen was again called by the following i
note from Dr. Wachendorf:
Dear Doctor: Please come at once and be !
prepared. Don't fail to respond, for the man '
j is suffering from clolnlc convulsions to-night.
i In ense you find it impossible to come your
self fend a responsible representative. 1 am
yours truly.
PR. C. C. J. WACHEXDORF.
315-4 Jessie street.
Concerning this visit Dr. Fehlen stated:
"When I arrived I found that it was not
a case of convulsions, but that the man
was in a deep coma state and close to
death. I did not administer chloroform.
! but gave him a potion of atrophine and
; strychnine, which is an antidote for nar
cotic poisoning. I believed him to have
< been prostrated from some such drug as
! morphine, and treated him by giving him
stimulants.
"I worked with the patient for three
' hours, or until 4 o'clock. When I left at
I this time Kehlenbeck had revived, become
stronger and his respiration was better. I
' told Dr. Wachendorf to continue to ad
minister stimulants and left. At 9 o'clock
yesterday morning I was again sum
: moned, and found the patient very weak
I and almost dead. 1 did not remain long.
: as I had my other practice to attend to.
, but advised that another physician be
called In. At 11 o'clock I heard that the
man had died."
Last night John Kelly and Rodger
Gere, both teamsters and acquaintances
of the dead man, called at the I'torijuo
and informed the officials that Kehlcn
beck had claimed to have possessed $700
in gold coin about ten days ago. He
stated that he had the money on his per
son. His reason for not banking !t. he
said, was o,n account of an old debt which
might cause it to be confiscated by his
creditors. John Winter, proprietor of the
Palace saloon, corner of Filbert street
and Montgomery avenue, who has known
the deceased from childhood, says that to
his personal knowledge Kehlenbeck drew
$-125 from the Overland Freight Company,
by whom he was employed, about one
month ago. He also says that in a con
versation three weeks ago his friend told
him he had considerable money.
Among the papers found in a trunk be
longing to the deceased are promissory
notes. recommendations, deeds, mort

gages and other Instruments which v.cr.ld
iniicate that the man had engaged in
real estate transactions. He paid large
promissory notes from time to time, and
records of lar.d purchases and sales in
San Luis Obispo County have been care
fully preserved. The paper which shows
the indebtedness mentioned by Kelly and
Gere was found. A receipt for $60 given
in payment for medical services to Dr.
Wachendorf is among his numerous p;i-
Ders.
Dr. Wachendorf was brought into the
Chief's office last night by Detectives
Eagar, and Sllvey. He will be detained
until a thorough investigation can be
made.
The doctor, who is a young man, talks
freely about the case and seems to Vie
surprised that the police wave held him.
His story in substance Is as follows:
"I came down from the country about
I three months ago and about two weeks
. j ago met Kehlenbeck, who was suffering
from a complication of diseases. Tney
consisted chiefly of chronic convulsions,
â¢ caused by an inherited dementia. He was
also afflicted with disease. I used the
usual medicines indicated for such cases
â  so successfully thai three days ago l pro
, nounced him free from one of the organic
1 diseases.
"The convulsions- continued, however, to
i such an alarming extent that I was
. obliged to call in an assistant In the per
| son of Dr. Fehlen. His diagnosis of the
1 case was similar to mine, and he made
; but a slight change in the administration
; of remedies. Sunday night my patient
â  became unconscious, and although I did
â  all in my power to resuscitate him. my
j efforts were fruitless, as he gradually
| sank lower and lower until he died."
Dr. Wachendorf claims to have gradu
! ated from a medical college in Ohio about
I nine years ago. and has a license to prac
| tice medicine in this State. He cannot
\ account for his patient lying in a coma
! tose state for such a long time, but thinks
j it due either to reaction from the convul
sions or from hypnotic influence.
He does not think It could have been
; caused by anything In the medicines, al
, though morphine was occasionally ad
: ministered in one-quarter grain doses at
, Intervals of thirty minutes. The doctor's
statement regarding hypnotism is unique
. and interesting. lie claims to possess
1 great hypnotic power and says he has fre
quently been called upon to give expert
j testimony in cases where hypnotism was
i alleged.
"It is possible," he said, "that I may
: have hypnotized my patient unconscious
j ly. He was what I would call a very good
subject. It is just possible that i hyp
notized him into a state of unconscious
! ness without knowing It. This did not
occur to me at the time, or I would have
; tried dehypnotizing. As it was. I simply
i used artificial respiration and other ordi
: nary means, such as slapping the face and
, hands and chafing the wrists."
Besides being a hypnotist. Dr. Waehen
dorf claims to be a physician of both the
! allopathic and homeopathic schools.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. .Tun" 26.â For a few minutes
around the opening in wheat It looked as If
Saturday's sharp decline was to be repeated.
The same Influencesâ heavy receipts, u.ik
cables and favorable crop conditions were
present and Influenced considerable new
liquidation. The opening in September was at
74 ; Â»'u74 1 4c, compared with Saturday's closing
price of 74 1 t4Â®74%c. The market broke still
further at once under heavy selling pressure,
longs liquidating freely and shorts putting out
! new lines, September touching 7:! 7 <,c on the
j decline. Covering by the shorts who were
I satisfied with their profits and buying against
puts then caused a rally to 74Ue. but before
11 o'clock the market started on a decline
which carried it to a point almost under Sat
urday's final price. The decline was so fast
I that sellers became too enthusiastic, and when
â  about 11:30 the liquidation of long wheat let
! up temporarily, the market recovered with a
! suddenness that Indicated that shorts had con
', siderably oversold. There was quite a little
scramble tot cover for a time, the price 'of
I September advancing to 74 l ?iifi74 : t c before noon.
[ The market evened up to some extent, and the
i tendency thereafter was downward. The news
would admit of no other course when condi
tions were normal and prices gradually slipped
I off to 74jÂ»74V&e for September, which was the
quotation at the close.
Corn was fairly active and Irregular. The
â  market was weak during the morning on
â  enormous receipts, favorable weather and the
- break in wheat. Elevator people were free
sellers. The market later became firm and
; more than recovered the early break. The
close was %c higher.
Oats In common with corn ruled weak and
lower early, but when corn advanced oats fol
lowed. September closed %c higher.
Provisions were weak early, due to liberal
, hog: receipts and consequent liquidation by
longs. Excellent cash demand helped the mar
ket later, nearly all the decline being recov
ered. At the close September pork war 2V4c
lower, lard a shade lower, ribs a shade lower.

PORTLAND, Or., June 26.â Locally about the
1 only change noticeable In wheat was a little
: more of a disposition to sell on the part of
the growers, but as shipowners are still very
Independent, exporters are not getting between
I the two forces and the season will probably
drift out. Fifty-eight cents was obtainable for

WHEAT AND OTHER GRAINS.
WHEATâ Heavy receipts and fine weather
i depressed the Chicago market. The demand
was lltjht and chiefly to fill shorts. Toward
the close of the session buying by New York I
and St. Louis gave the market a little better |
tone. Odebsa' cabled some improvement in the
prospects for that district. Paris cabled a
weak market and favorable weather. There
was me foreign buying at New York. Snow
reported a small decline in the condition of the
winter crop since June 1, the falling oft being
; the heaviest in those States which made the 1
I â  -it Bhowing on that date. The county re- |
turns now coming in preclude the possibility 1
of any better yield than is now indicated, as '
the harvest is already at hand.

The report from the Consolidated California
and Virginia for the week is as follows.
"The Comstock Pumping Association has
been engaged in the following work at the
C. and C. shaft: 1400 levelâ The west drift has
been extended 23 feet: total length, 637 feet;
the face of this drift is in heavy clay and
porphyry. At a point 627 feet In we cut Into
water and a heavy clay wall having all the
appearance of the hanging wall of the Com
stock vein. We have yet to run 76 feet be
fore reaching- the crosscut No. 2 from the
Consolidated Virginia shaft. 1750 levelâ From
the stupes 94 feet south of the west crosscut
passing the winze to the 1800, we have ex
tracted fifty tons of ore of an average of
$25 S3 gold value of samples taken from . the
ore cars on the surface. Part of the ore Is
fillings from the track floor, the balance be-
Ing ore from new ground. In raising in this
t t\ew ground we find much better ore. On our,
second floor above the 1750 we have a width
of at least ten feet of clean ore that will assay
$60 per ton. This ore is separated from the
old stopes by a few feet of low-grade ore, por
phyry and clay. I have failed to find any
rceÃrd, either written or mapped, that wouH
Indicate that this ground had been Worked bo
fore. The ore Is ]!>Â« feet south of the old Cali
fornia south line and near what is believed to
be the footwall of th* vein. 1650 levelâNeces
sary repairs are being made on this level. The
air pipe from the surface to the head of the
winze extending from the 1750 to the ISOO has
been connected to the compressed air hoist;
the pipe line Is now being tested and we ex
pect to start work in the winze within two
days. In the shaft from . the 1750 to the 1860
level a three-inch compressed air pipe has
been carried down and this line will be ex
tended downward as the levels are drained,
Our machinery is in good order and now ready
for heavy vyork."
The report from the Ophlr mine for the past
week is as follows: "No underground work has
been done through our shaft during the week.
Central tunnelâ north drift has been ex
tended 31 feet; total length, 368 feet; face In
porphyry, showing some quartz. The survey
referred to last week showed that we had yet
29 feet to run to reach the Mexican line. The
face of the drift Is now in Mexican ground. A
joint east crosscut will 'be started on the Ophlr
and Mexican line on Monday morning. When
this crosscut reaches the hanging wall of
vein a west crosscut will be started and run
to the footwall of the vein. The Sutro tunnel
direct connection was advanced 13 feet; total
length. 209 feet; face In hard seamy rock.
During the week we have passed through a
seam of quarts bounded by clay walls. The
changes in the face are so frequent that we are
expecting to cut Into much softer rock. Work
on the quartz stringers has been continued and
the southwest drift extended 6 feet; total
length, 3s feet The face is in vein .'formation
showing more quartz than at any time since
the drift was started. No ore of value has
been found in this drift."
In the Chollar and Potosl mines the joint
west tunnel has been advanced during the
week 37 feet; total length, 209 feet; face In clay,
porphyry and boulders of quartz which give
low assays. On the tunnel level they have one
man on repairs. Sutro tunnel levelâ The Zadig
drift has been cleaned out and repaired to the
face. At a point 920 feet south from the Sutro
tunnel or 23 feet back from the face, started
a southwest drift and advanced It 6 feet; face
in very hard porphyry.

In Mr. Read's article ; I its the
:
When the workingman requires a suit of
clothes he has to pay cash or Installments to

public school is not pood enough for the rk

private school. Does the preacher? If the

full fare. Does the preacher <>r his family?
The preacher ceftus to have all the advan

The church treasurer is a man who will Ken
orally teli you that after paying the pastor
there Is very little money left for the painter,
thu printer or the Rag man. and these men all
have to live somehow on much lens than the
preacher fails to live on. The maxim that
every man is worthy of his hire Is eminently
true, but in all commercial enterprises re<juir

is always the first to feel the cut. In seasons

Careful investigation by experts in

Mr. Mitchell said that all he knew was
what he had tea' 1 , in the newspapers while
on his vacation. !!â â¢ paid Keating a high

Supervisor Weils said he had nothing
more to Bay, as he was satisfied that
Keating should be discharged afti r hear

S. Wilklns, the United States Fidelity and
Guaranty Company, constable 1". 1,.
White, B. B. White and A. Olander, sure
tlea of the last named; Deputy Constable
Jordan and Ethel E. Anthony, for the re-,
( overy of 125,000 damages for false impris
onment.
\< < urdinp to the r-r.mplalnt. prepared by
Attorney w. J. Oglesby, the original
trouble was occasioned by a roan mare
belonging to Ethel Anthony, who engaged
â  Deputy Sheriff TVilklns and Deputy Con-
Btable Jordan to restore the animal to her;
possession. Woods alleges that she re
fused to pay $27 still due for pasturage,!
and that when he refused to give up the
j horse the two officers exhibited their ,
' stars, telling plaintiff no other authority |
would be necesisary, forcibly took pos- !
session of the animal, restoring it to j
Ethel Anthony on tho 16th lnst.
"Thereupon Wilklns, Jordan and Ethel
; Anthony." concludes th*Â» complaint,
"wickedly contriving and Intending to in- i
jure plaintiff, maliciously caused plaintiff
to be arrested on :i charge of disturbing
Ethel Anthony's peace, causing his Ira- j
prisonment in the City Prison without ;
a,use to be detained there for;
1 more than ten hours, rind from which i
imprisonment ho was released by judg- j

"That by reason of said . Imprisonment
plaintiff was put to great Inconvenience,

to his damage $25,000."
CALLED IT A CINCH GAME.
Heated Words Pass While Supervis-
ors Consider Eicls for Furnish
ing County Supplies.
OAKLAND, June 26.â The Board of Su
pervisors to-day awarded contracts for
furnishing supplies to the county. There
were many bidder? present and a lively
s^ene occurred, owing to the fact that Jo-
Bepb H- rscher of San Leandro, bidder for
furnishing groceries, was the only one
who submitted samples, and Supervisor
Wells moved that no bids be considered
accompanied by samples.
Supervisor Roeth vigorously opposed
this motion, when Mr. Herscher jolted his
memory with the fact that last year
Roeth had insisted on samples being sub
mitted The latter replied rather heated
ly that from the fact that "Herscher was
the only one offering samples it looked
like a cinch proposition."
"I am not currying favor with any bid
der " continued Roeth, "but this is the
worst cinch ever presented to a Board of
Supervisors."
The entire afternoon was occupied with
â¢i thorough consideration of the bids, the
contracts being finally awarded as fol
lows: Teas and coffees, to Joseph Hersch
er and New York Tea company; all gro
ceries of which samples were furnished,
Herscher; liquors, Herscher and Theo
Oier- dry goods, Salinger Bros, and
Herscher; fuel for county buildings, James
p Tavlor & Co.; fuel for County Inllrm
ary Davie & Williams.

RICH SPOIL
OF THIEVES
IS RECOVERED
Oakland Police Make
a Big Haul.
CHINESE "FENCE" IS LOCATED
A WASH HOUSE FILLED WITH
THE STOLEN GOODS.
Â«.
Many Valuable Articles and the
Weapons of Highbinders
Found â A Well-Known
Chinese Arrested.
OAKLAND, June 26.â One of the most
extensive recoveries of stolen property
ever made in this city was effected to
night In a Chinese boarding house at
Ki^hth and Webster streets. Not only
were many valuable articles obtained by
the raid, but evidence was procured to
show that the place Is a den of high
rs. Jt is also suspected that the
Chinese cook who was arrested is in ex
convict who was sent to San Quentin
some years aK'> from Santa Barbara for
assault to murder.
The raid was brought about through the ]
i arrest of Ah Charley, who was recently
discharged from Mrs. Horton's residence
1 at Twenty-sixth aVenue and East Four
teenth Btreet, where h< was employed as '
; a domestic. After he left, the Hortons
â  missed much valuable property and -a
warrant was sworn to charging him with ;
grand larceny.
To-nlghl Deputy Constable Jack Rnb-
Inson located Ah Charley by a ruse and
i ffected his air. -st. and when he had been
spirited off to the County Jull unknown to
his confederates a raid was made upon
the house by Officer Robinson and Detec
tives Quigli y and ! [odgklns.
hi Charley's room were found table
ware, linen, silverware, hat racks, vases,
portieres. Jewelry, ornaments, books and
nearly everything thai could be made into
a small bundle. These articles were in
iges just as they had been taken
from the house. Mrs. Horton Identified
all the stuff as her property.
The police decided to Bearch the whole
house, atid found it to be a regular Chi
; ese "fence." There were pictures, a
chest of Boap, piles of linen and hundreds
of minor articles, evidently from the
houses of wealthy people.
Pome of the stuff was marked with th"
s * . i : . 1 1 > of a Los Angeles hotel. Borne table
ware bore the stamp of White Sulphur
Springs. Miss Josie McDonald and Gene
vleve Wood are owners of Borne of the
property.
There was enough stuff found to fill the
patrol wagon. In an inside room was a
tion of "black-jacks," highbinders'
knives and clubs, and these also were
taken to the City Prison, in searching
Charley's effects a letter was found ad
d to "Chung Yu, San Quentin." The
record of Yu is a very black one, and it
is bellev( d that the convict Is none other
than Charley, who has within the past
year worked in Beveral families in this
city, including Dr. W. < â¢. Auckland.
The recovered pn Perty Is at the prison,
where own< n â¢ an â '.â¢ nttfy it.
THE BOARD OF HEALTH
WILL TAKE ORDERS
LEON DENNERY TO BE ELECTED
SECRETARY.
The Protest Against His ChoicÃ Is
Not Heeded by the Appoint
ing Powers.
The law, as Interpreted by the courts,
gives the Board of Health power to dis
pense with the present force of employes
in the Health Department; hence the
work of distributing the spoils of office
will not be long delayed.
The board will meet to-night and prob
ably proceed to remove incumbents and
appoint their successors. Leon Dennery
Is on the slate for secretary of the board.
The dose is a hard one for the doctors to
swallow, but the powers which directed
Gage to select the men composing the
new Hoard of Health now demand that
Dennery shall have the position.
Regard for the moral health of the
community prompted the board to enter
a. silent protest against Dennery's selec
tion for secretary, but the protest was
not heeded by Burns. The hint has been
given that Dennery Is the right kind of
person to represent Burns.

Coombs will close for the prosecution.
THE CORONER'S
CARPET WALK
DRAWS NEAR
Politics and Reform
Hand in Hand.
PATRONAGE IN THE SHADOW
CHURCH SAID TO BE THE MAN
WITH AN AX.
A New Deal That Has Hung Fire for
Months Because There Are
Two Many "Pulls"
at Work.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, June 26.
Next week Coroner Mehrmann is to
walk the carpet before the Supervisors
and explain certain alleged overcharges
in his monthly accounts against the coun
ty. Many weeks have elapsed since the
county expert reported the alleged over
charges, and when the subject Was dis
cussed by the Supervisors each member
of that body took particular pains to go
on record as not being tho man who in
stigated the inquiry into Coroner Mehr
mann's charges. Jt now develops that be
neath this opposition to Mehrmann's fig
ures is an interesting political feud that
developed during- the last county cam
paign.
Supervisor Church, it is said, did not re
ceive the support he expected In certain
parts of his district, where it was under
stood Coroner Mehrmann had some Influ
ence. It is even hinted that in one corner
of Alameda IÂ»r. Mehrmann was not alto
gether unfriendly to Mr. church's op
ponent. Mehrmann and Church both won
their fights, but Church's majority was
small enough to cause him considerable
anxiety until many hours after the polls
closed.
As soon ns the Supervisors organized
after election an attempt was made to
rearrange the patronage of the doctors at
the Receiving Hospital, County Jail and
Infirmary. As chairman of the Hospital
Committee Church could do a great deal
with this particular patronage. He had a
programme which included l>r. Porter to
succeed ]>r. Btratton at the Receiving
Hospital, bo that ex-Coroner Dr. Baldwin
could be given the place at the County
Jail. I>r. Stratton is Senator Stratton's
brother, and of course Church's attempt
to put out the Senator's brother met with
strong opposition, in which Pr. Mehrmann
was supposed to b< on the side of Strat
ton. It is well known that during Dr.
Baldwin's term nf office he frequently
showed his friendship for Supervisor
Church, and for this reason it is very nat
ural that Church should seek to n ward
him at this time, and if possible should
cause uneasiness for ]>r. Mehrmann.
The Coroner states that he Will bo quite
prepared to â¢ â  x t â  ! : i i : 1 all his charges when
he goes before the Supervisor next week.

WILL SIGN NO PETITION.
General Warfield and His Guests
Strongly Oppose the Contem
plated Franchise.
General Warfield, when seen last night
and asked his opinion on the advisability
of the franchise, said: "I don't want to
see any electric road go down on Bush
street nor does any one of the guests In
my house. Mr. Baldwin seems to fhiuk
it Is a good thing and as he is acting for
the owners of the property 7 suppose they
wish it also. But it Is my business first
to consult the wishes of my guests and
therefore I am most strongly opposed to
it. The situation of the house is such
that it is quiet and away from the noise
of the street cars, and neither 1 nm 1 those
who patronize me wish noisy, sleep-dis
turbing electric cars to go whizzing past
our windows.
"Mr. Baldwin left a petition here to
night praying that the Supervisors grant
the necessary franchises. The only
names, thus far. on the petition are his
own and that of Mrs. Stanley, for whom
he is acting, and they are about the only
names that will go on it from this house.
] don't wish to buck against a Btone
wall and fur that reason am going no
farther in my opposition than to protest.
No, neither I nor any of my guests are
in favor of any such undertaking."
THE SOUTHWELL COMPANY
WILL REMAIN TO CHARM
MOROSCO MANAGES TO SECURE
THE TALENTED TROUPE.
Music Lovers Will Be Pleased to
Learn That They Will Be Able
to Enjoy Good Opera
for Months.
The Southwell Opera Company will re
main m this city and occupy the boards
at the Grand Opera-house for a much
longer season than was at iirst antici
pated, thanks to a sharp business deal
entered Into last week between the mem
bera of the company and Walter M<>
rosco.
Southwell, under whose management
the company came here a few months
ago from the East, leaves to-morrow
night for the Fast again, perhaps to or
ganize a new company, for the one which
has been playing to biff houses at the
Grand Opera-house under his direction
have all signed themselves over to Walter
Morosco, and they will continue to pre
sent popular operas throughout the com
ing fall and winter. Morosco has sue
â  i in securing the services of every
member of the company. En addition Mr.
Morosco has made a contraci with wolf,
the Eastern costumer who lias furnished
the company with the gorgeous costumes
which they hare worn in the production
of the operas which they have thus far
rendered to the local music loving public.
Mr. Wolf is the proud possessor of a
collection of costly costumes f'>r nearly
every opera that was ever presented by
a first-class company. The singers have
be< â â  engaged by Morosco to remain at
the Grand for a period of forty-three
weeks.
Luckily for them, their contracts with
Mr. Southwell had < xpired, and when Mo
rosco offered them flattering inducements
to remain here they readily accepted.
TAX ON STUDENTS.
The Governor Calls a Special Meet
ing of the University
Regents.
Governor On pro has called a special
mooting of the regents of the State Uni
versity for the purpose of reconsidering
their action in taxing each student a
matriculation fee of $2i\ The meeting will
be held on next Saturday.
While there Is considerable opposition to
the proposed tax the governing body of
the institution claims that such action is
necessary in order to overcome the de
ficiency in the fund for maintenance. In
explanation of the action of the majority
of the regents one of thorn said yesterday:
"All we want is an assurance from Gov
ernor Gage that if the regency borrows
the money to pay the Indebtedness the
State will make some provision for its re
payment. We have carefully considered
the matter, and unless the Governor
comes to our rescue the proposed tax will
have to stand."
STOLE A PIPE.
Officer Butler's Lively Chase After a
Petty Offender.
Edmund Rich, a man well known to the
police south of Market street, walked into
the Sunset Bazaar on Third street last
night and when he saw what appeared
to be a favorable opportunity snatched a
pipe and ran. A cry wa.s immediately
raised and Officer Butler started in pur
suit of the man, followed by an excited
crowd. Rich was captured on Second
Street, between Market and Mission, and
taken to the City Prison, where he was
charged with petty larceny and vagrancy.

Rev. Everett M. Hill, pastor of the

East Oakland, caused some diversion at.
the weekly meeting of the Methodist
ministers yesterday morning by reading
a paper on "Cremation Versus Burial."
The paper contained some striking ideas,
and the discussion which followed its
reading proved highly interesting. Rev.
E. P. Dennett expressed himself forcibly,
lie said:
"The niches In the columbarium at the
Odd Fellows' Cemetery have been given
Greek names ami there is no suggestion
that the building is the last resting place
of the dead in a Christian land. The
general effect is that of a heathen tem
ple. I should hate to have the ashes of
one I love left there, where there is no
name or symbol of Christianity. It al
most seems as If It were a wan_m insult
to Christian faith. I am a believer in
cremation, but I would not want to be
put in a place like that when I die."
Rev. Dr. I'rmy favored incineration,
and stated that when he passed away his
friends would oblige him by cremating
his remains. Dr. Coyle was opposed to
cremation. He said it was nothing more
than annihilation, and he could not bear
the idea of seeing the remains of any of
his loved ones "housed in a tin can."
In expounding his views on the subject,
Dr. Hill iirst traced the history of cre
mation as a foundation for his argument.
He said:
Without doubt it is a fact that cremation I
erased in Europe because of the religious sen
timent against It, as It was thought to be an- \
tagonistl* to humanity and to interfere with j
the resurrection and the rehabilitation of the j
body at the Judgment. These sentiments ob
tain to a great extent to-day, and are mÂ«.re j
prevalent than la generally believed. It is |
thought that if cemeteries are in cities or near
residences the gases escaping will contaminate
the air and corrupt matter percolating through
the earth will impregnate the water, which |
when consumed brings on typhoid fever and
many other diseases.
The eyes of science are exceedingly sharp
and we are admonished <>n all Fides to beware I
of the germs that are everywhere in our lives.
Some enterprising silversmith got hold of the
idea ot transferring germs by contact and by
careful and systematic advertising terrified the
people into giving up thÂ» common cup of our
Savior for the stylish individual cups of mod
ern society churches. In fact so horrifying
are the ghosts of imagination that contagious
perms hover over the heads of lovers, that the
agonizing thought is ever present that the ,
delicious art of kissing is to be relegated to
the sweet dream of the heyday past. In fact, ;
the society custom of ladies greeting each other
with a kiss will doubtless ere long be dis
placed by the more hygienic Oriental custom of
rubbing noses.
Probably the Idea "f cremation Is more, than
a fad, though doubtless it will eventually takf
on more the nature of a "â¢fashion." the thought
of the health of the living never entering the
of the vast majority.
The speaker then quoted P>lla "Wheeler
Wllcox. Professor Joseph Le Cbnte and
other well-known people who are believ
ers in cremation. In concluding, he said:
"Bury the dead for the sake of the liv
ing in the most beautiful s]x>t of earth
When it is not needful to burn them for
the sake of the living."
The following officers were elected to
act during the ensuing term: President,
â¢ 'harks Edward Locke: secretary. Rev.
E. P. Dennett; committee on programme.
Rev. J. N. Beard, Rev. A. N. Iseedharn
and Rev. E. M. Hill.
CHANGES IN ASSESSMENTS.
Outlying Districts Get the Benefit of
New Valuations.
Assessor Dodge baa about completed
the real estate assessment roll. It will
show many marked changes in outlying
districts, where for years property has
been assessed for much more than the I
owners thought just. Uniform reductions
made under the new assessment cover an
area embracing three-quarters of the
property in the city and county. The
districts comprising this area are all
homestead tracts and include Richmond,
property south of the park, South San
Francisco, Homer's addition and from
Thirtieth street down to the county hue.
Certain sections of down-town busines.s
property, where rent values have been
steadily declining, have been reduced in
the aggregate $800,000. This total reduc
tion of more than $2,000,000 is more than
offset by the Increase in the valuation of
certain Veal estate. on the chief thorough
fares and in the best business sections, .
where the valuation has been consider- :
ably less than in other portions of the j
city in proportion to the selling price.
It is estimated, however, that the tax
on all real estate, whether the valuation
has been lessened or increased, will be
decreased. This is owing to the fact th:it '
the great increase in the assessment roll j
will result in a lower tax rate. An hi- J
spectlon of the tax roll shows that the
increase in the personal property rolls
has been made through increased assess- j
ments on the personal property of quasi
public corporations, as well as through I
large additions brought about through :n- !
creased assessments on capitalists and
money lenders. It is also estimated that
from $5,0'i0,000 to $10,000,000 will be added
to the rolls by increased assessments of
mercantile and business houses, assessed
last year considerably below the assess
ment on others in the same business.
In the Divorce Court.
Ar.nio K. Lindsay was prantcti a divorce
yesterday from John R. Lindsay on the
ground of extreme cruelty. Mrs. Lindsay
was allowed alimony in the sum of $15 a
month.
Suits for divorce have been filed by
Apnes David against Robert L. David, for
extreme cruelty; Selrto Abramsky against
Isaac Abramsky, for failure to provide,
and Ella F. Loehr against George W.
Loehr, for infidelity.

Captain W. R. Kidd of th* British ship I
Crompton has had more experience with
burning- vessels Ulan perhaps any master
now In port. Last yr>ar he was master of
the Hollinwood and Is now back here for .
: the first time since that vessel was burned
â 
While on her way here from Newcastle.
N. S. \v.. with coal tliÂ«j Holllnwood'a i
r.irgo heated and Captain Ivldd had to put ;
' into Port Lyttleton, X. '/... in distress, j
â¢. After: setting away from New Zealand he i
n-.et the British ship Republic, from New- â 
cnstle, also for San Francisco. She was !
â¢â on fire, and for five days the crew, aided
'by. men from the Hol'.inwood, fought the j
\ â fiamo?. but finally they had to retire
â¢!l>eatnn. Captain find crew went aboard
flit* Hollinwood and Captain Kidd brought!
theni to San Francisco The Republic j
' .bnrned for several weeks and then sunk.
-After loading wheat here Captain Kidd J
; took- the Hollinwood to England, and
'.from There via a South American port to i
Sydney; X. S. W. While in Australia he
,' .voa's -jnarried and his bride accompanied
.â¢.Win .when the inwood once more
reatted for England. She was loaded with |
. ;^oi.il : . tallow, hides, glue, copra and lum- ;
..â¢be.ii7.arid it proved to be a most disastrous
- :i''aFF>; to handle.
â¢ 'â¢-â .\y l ti.en the Eiollinwood was about 300
â¢ mile:*- southwest of the Azores a fire was
â discovered in the fore hatch. Smoke was
coming out of the ventilators and things
â¢â¢jbegari to look .serious. The fore hatch
w.-ir taken off and some of the cargo was
â¢ broken out. A bale of glue pieces was
.' found to bo on lire and it was thrown
â¢.overboard. The danger was over for the
time being; but a careful watch was kept.
:J2lght days later the smoke â¢ ran to come
' out of^tbe ventilators again, and when j
.. the fore hatch was taken off the flames
'burst forth with such fierceness as to
"drive the crew aft.
â¢ The fire was discovered during the night '
â¢nr.ri during the previous day Captain Kidd |
â  had spoken the German bark Pallas and
â  the British ship Pattardale. When he saw
lhat-the fire was likely to gain the mas
tery he began firing rockets and stood
flown In the direction where he thought
the' two vessels would be.
Soon after the fore hatch was taken off i
.thvy copra caught fire and the fore hold
' became a furnace. The heated air blew
â¢Xo: R- hatch off. the foremast began to
settle,,: the water alongside the vessel be
â ': gan- to .'sizzle and the Hollinwood looked ;
vdVuiryed. The men were driven away from
. the.' pumps by tin- smoke, but buckets
. were: procured and the Rght against the
Tin*. ! fiend went on. Captain Kidd tried
: Fpvernl times to pet bis wife to leave the
bi'p in one of the boats, but she would
. ry>t desert him. She stayed by the Hol
'. linwood to the lust and left the vessel
with Captain Kidd.
After fighting the fire for twelve hours
,' Captain Kidd and his crew took the boat a
â¢ nnd boarded Ihe Pallas and â¢ rdale.
: Captain and Mrs. Kidd went on the Pallas
'and on September 13 last reached Eng
land. A Spanish merchantman put Into â 
the Azores before that date and reported
â¢ the Holllnwood on fire and abandoned,
The news was telegraphed all over the
world; and for a time Mrs. Kidd's rela
tives in Australia gave her up for lost. .
A. Danish man-of-war also sighted the
burning ship and cruised around for
nearly a week looking for her boats con
taining the crew.
Soon after be Â«ot hack to England the
owners of the Hollinwood made Captain
Kidd master of the Crorapton; and he at
once took her to Swansea to load for San
Francisco. She arrived here a few days
; . ogo and will load wheat for Europe. Cap
tain Kidd has a host of friends In this
port, as lie has been coming here for the
past -eighteen years as apprentice, third,
â  second and first mate, and latterly as
"master. His new command is one of the
largest and finest steel vessels coming
â  here; She brought 14M tons of coal and
rokf> from Swansea.
k, .".:- THe crew of the American bark Rufus
' E. Wood had an experience during the
voyage from Sydney. X. S. W.. to San
.-.Francisco that they will not forget In a
â¢ hurry. On April 2. in latitude 33 degrees
-.' south, longitude IS-0 degrees west, a shock
â¢'â¢ ! of earthquake made the vessel shiver. The
watch below rushed on deck and every
body thought for a moment the vessel had
â¢ struck a rock. A rush was made for the
hoats, but Captain McLeod Boon recalled
Trffr men to their duty. The pumps were
â â 't.r.ie.H and no leak found, after which an
examination was made. It was then seen â¢
from the general appearance of things !
. that it was an earthquake that had given
â  thÂ« men the scare.

DESTRUCTION OR THE HOLLINWOOD.
Orawn From a Description Given toy Captain W/. R. Kldd.
ON her last visit here, a year ago, the Hollinwood brought in the crew of the ship Republic, burned at sea. On that
voyage the Hollinwood had been herself on fire, but Captain Kldd and his men put It out. From here the Hollin
wood went to England, and thence to Sydney. N. S. W., where she loaded wool, tallow, copra, glue and lumber.
During the vessel's stay in Australia Captain Kidd was married, and his bride failed with him on his outward trip!
The cargo caught fire and was put out. It caught fir? again and the vessel was destroyed. All hands were saved. Cap
tain Kldd arrived here a few days ago as master of the British ship Crompton.

ASSESSOR DODGE
HAS TROUBLE FOR
THE BOYS ON TAP
A General Clean-Out
Coming.
MANY DISCHARGES AT HAND
NEW MEN FOR OLD JOBS IN A
POLITICAL TIME.
The Office Trembles at the Report
That Several Regular Deputies
Will Be Cashiered
This Week.
An Impending- shake-up In the Assess
or's office Is keeping many of the em
ployes on the verge of nervous prostra
tion and creating a good deal of quiet gos
sip among the City Hall employes and
other "pollles."
It Is an open secret that on Friday next
a small cyclone will strike the otHoe. On
that day about fifty employes of the class
known as "outside deputies" will be let
out. These are the neld men, who have
been employed, as usual, In canvassing
the property owners of the city and re
porting on their worldly possessions for
the purposes of the Assessor's roll, and
they will be discharged merely because
their work will be done and their stat
utory time of employment is up. as the
Assessor's roll must be completed and
turned over to the Supervisors by the first
Monday In July.
The relief of these fifty Job holders will
be regular and natural and the cause of
no especial comment, but the trouble will
be that a lot of the regular office force
will be "tired" along with them, and ap
parently for political reasons. A number
of those who were of the lucky small
minority of place hunters who really rot
on the Assessor's regular payroll through
the political pulls that counted after iJr.
Dodge's election will be set adrift, like
chips, In this outgoing tide of "extras,"
and the number is reported to be any
where from eight to a dozen. It will be
alleged, It Is said, that these are incom
petent, and that their discharge and the
appointment of several new men in their
places is simply In the interest of the
highest efficiency of the office.
More Interest is displayed In the ques
tion of who will go in than In the one of
who will go out. The vacancies will af
ford a chance to do politics In a critical
time, and the politicians are wondering
how and through what Influences the pol
itics will bÂ»> done.
BACK PAY FOR TEACHERS.
They Will Get the Drawback on Their
January Salaries.
Warrants for tin- 5 per rÂ»-nt of the Janu
ary salary of the teachers in the Bchool
department held back through an agree
ment of the School Board with the Audi
tor, will be paid this month. All that re
mains to be done is for President Berge
rot of the board and Superintendent Web
ster to affix their names to the demands.
This it is said they will accomplish by
the loss of :l little sleep so that the
precious documents may be In the hands
of the teachers by Friday morning. It is
safe to say that tlvy will all be in the
keeping of the treasurer before he closes
that evening.
Our National Faith.
This evening the Rev. Alexander N.
Carson will lecture before San Francisco
Council No. 14. Order of Americus, in Its
council room In the Alcazar building, on
"(Mir National Faith." Complimentary
tickets can be obtained from any member
of the council.

FRAUD AND FRANCHISES BEFORE THE SUPERVISORS
CORKSCREW FRANCHISE
IS OFFERED FOR SALE
The Valued Privilege Placed on
the Public Market.
Supervisors Ignore the Captious Objections of Mayor
Phelan and Grant the Appeal of Merchants
for a Cross=Town Road.
THTC merchants and property
owners of the northc-ustrrn and
southern districts of the city
have at last won a victory, not
withstanding the antagonism
acl persistent opposition of Mayor
Phelan and Supervisor Kyington. The
1 of Supervisors offered for pale
yesterday the corkscrew franchise, and
will be opened on July 31. The
tet-street Railway Company was
also granted the right to use the over
hi ad system of electricity on its Post
â¢ mad. Both propositions were
ted as they came from the Street
i . immitu-e, the franchise for the loop
on Grant avenue and Bush street being
denied.
I'ntil the very last Mayor Phelan and
rvisor Bylngton offered objections
and technical obstacles, but they were
I down. The Mayor, who had been
hiding behind Bylngton and placing all
risibility upon that official's
shoulders, waa forced to show his hand,
hen he did so the merchants, who
have so much at stake, made their plea
to him. He made no comment and
s-rily had no vote. The franchises
! th<- board without his sanction.
The meeting of the Supervisors yes
was interesting from many
â  ' :â¢ a. As soon as the minutes
had beer read the Mayor exercised an
exceptional privilege In an effort to
p risibility of the gas rate
. which had such an inglorious
usion in Judge Seawell's court.
The. I l" a thousand feet for
leclared illegal because it
rninated against certain classes in
I â  unity. The resolution adopt
ed bj â¢'! of Supervisors had
pared in Mayor Phelan's office
and under his direction. The responsi
bility fir the discrimination rested,
re, upon the Mayor.
Hi nor seiz.-ii the opportunity

he was not responsible for the mistake.

â  ition was adopted in a hurry the
Ice in all probability was Inno

â  : ination of th" Mayor leaves
tter in a more serious condition
than :t was before. The very interest
ing fact remains that the resolution â

;'â¢ After the Mayor had made his expla- '
. .nation: and another mat of public
â¢ Importance, had received attention,
Supervisor Holland called for a con
sideration of franchises out of order.!
â  The same petitioners who have haunted :
â "â  "â  the'rooms of the Street Committee were '
â¢ : before the board. They were deter
: â¢mined this time not to be trapped by t
: - 'the filibustering of the Mayor. They !
â¢ hr"l found his Honor profuse in prom- '
ises but lax in performance, and they
came to fight for themselves. Repre
sentative property- r.'TK, merchants,
â  Improvement clubs ar.fi the Merchants'
Association, all were in aggressive at
tendance and the fight began. The
.â â  franchises as they came from the Street
;.;. Committee were read, and then Super
;".."visof Aigeltinger moved an amend
: â¢ nt.
He urged that the rirant-avenue and
(iiVÃtreet loop he included in the j
corkscrew franchise. Supervisor At- j
tridge- immediately seconded the
i ndment.
Supervisor Holland objected em

husinesa men. workingmen and prop
erty owners," hÂ»' Bald, "want thlrt rrops
town railroad, and do not let us jeo
pardize it by pllinjy amendments upon
it. I^et up dispose of the crosstown
road and then 1 am in favor of the
Grant-avenue loop and not before."
"But." urged AipeltinKt-r, "the Mer
chants' Association is in favor of this
Grant-avenue spur."
"And I see no objection to it." added
Mayor Phelan, who had undergone a
change of mind. "Indeod, 1 see many
advantages In it."
"So do I." interjected Supervisor Hol
land. "I am ready to vote for it after
we finish with the crosstown railroad."
"Since you are talking about amend
ments," Interrupted Supervisor By
ington, "how about my amendment Â°n
the flat rail?" There had been a linger
ing hope that Supervisor Bylngton was
asleep, but he was awake and watch-
Ing. He was representing what subse
quently proved to be the -Mayor's
hobby. It was shown that the amend
m< nt on flat rails had been rejected by
the Street Committee, hh Supervisor
Bylngton, with a persistency worthy of
a better cause, reintroduced it upon the
warning suggestion of Mayor Phelan.
A V'lt^- was then taken on the amend
ment offered by Supervisor Aigeltinger
to provide Cor th.> Grant avenue lo<rp.
ThÂ« amendment was lost. Supervisors
Aigeltinger. Attridge and Phelps aloni
voting for it. This killed the proposi
tion beyond the possibility of revival,
a result that some members of the
board did not realize until it had been
accomplished.
Consideration of Byington's amend
ment was next in order. There was a
long discussion over flat rails, but the
arguments were precisely the same ;<-s
those that had been advanced before
the Street Committe on Thursday.
Prsident Dohrmann of the Merchants'
Association pleaded for the road. He
begged that the Mayor and the Super
visors permit an Improvement, which
has become a necessity. The mer
chants, he said, are willing to accept
the terms of the railroad and only offi
cial objection can block the building of
the road. Others spoke in the same
strain and urged the objectors to give
way.
Mayor Pheian had a score of objec
tions to offer. He said that he could
see no reason why the flat rails should
not be used. HÂ»- had heard no reason
able excuse why the railroad company
should not use Buch rails. He wanted
to h>-ar some practical objection to
them. It was pointed out to him that
tli" rails are not objectionable. They
are as good as those now in us.- on
Marki t strict, and the people who want
the crosstown road are willing to. ac
cepi them. But the Mayor talked about
wheel flanges and other Interesting de
tails. The people of two great sections
of the city were thinking of the '
lit of a new road. The Mayor said the
flat rails were in use In other cities
and the merchants reiterated that they
want a road.
The discussion continued for an hour
and then a vote was taken on Bying
ton's amendment. The amendment was
lost, Supervisors Byington, Heyer,
Lackmann and Perrault alone voting
for it. Th- board then voted to offer
the franchise for sale. The tight had
been won and the Mayor's opposition
had counted for nothing.
The Market-street Railway Company
is expected to be the only bidder, and
in \i< \v of that fact Mayor I'helan se
rured from the corporation a material
â â . ncession.
The franchise act of I*W7 says "no
I'll tiitage shall he paid for the first
rive years," but thereafter at least 3
per cent shall be paid of the gToss re
celpts. But thp charter which goes
Into effect January 1 next says that at
least 3 per cent of the gross receipts
shall be paid during the first Bye years,
4 per cent for the next ten years and 5
per cent thereafter till the franchise
expires.
The board cnuld not, under the ex
isting act of 1597, require any percent
age for the first five years, but the com
pany could, as they did, agree to hid
more than the present law requires.
Just before the meeting of the board
the Mayor asked Attorney Jeremiah
Burke and Agent Lynch of the Market
street Railway Company if they would
respect the charter provisions if the
franchise wt?re granted and they finally
agreed to do so. The franchises are
only grnnt^d for the life of the con
necting franchises, so they will all ex
pire together and be then a valuable
property, with all their feeders.
The agreement which binds the Mar
ket-street Railway Company to re
spect the provisions of tho charter is
as follows:
Board of Supervisors,
June IN, 1899.
We agree that we will bid at least, the.
minimum percentages of the gross re
ceipts as required by the new charter if
the "corkscrew" (so-called) franchise is
offpre<i for s;tle hy the board under the
provisions of the law of 1897, as reported
by thf' ''ommitte-e. on Streets.
MARKET-STREET RAILWAY CO.
Per H. H. Lynch, agent.
This ends the long controversy over
franchises. The city gains a benefit
and the railroad retirr-s profitless from
a raid.
To Abolish Commissions.
At the meeting of the local passenger
aEfnts to-day It will be proposed that the
custom of paying commissions to outnlfio
persona who brinp business to the differ
ent roads be abolished. It has been
the habit of brokers, hackmen, hotel run
ners and others whose vocations bring
them in contact with the traveling public
to divide their commission with the pur
chaser of the ticket, thus to all intents
and purposes cutting the rates.

Dupont, St Mary's. California and Pine
streets. This decision of the board
represents a victory which has been
won after four years of persistent
agitation and endeavor. The crusade
was begun by the Paulist fathers and
was continued through the able assist
ance of all decent classes and creeds
affected by the criminal evil. Rev. Dr.
Foute of Grace Episcopal Church be
came an active and able coadjutor of
Father Otis, and together they have
won a triumph which means an im
measurable benefit to the city.
In the promise now Riven the Super
visors will donate the stipulated sum,
condemnation proceedings will be com
menced, rookeries will be removed and
a park will be created. In setting aside
$125,000 for this purpose the Super
visors will not violate their pledge.
They will still be within the dollar
limit. As Supervisor Perrault pointed
out at the me. -tine: yesterday JSO.OOO
alone will be saved in gas bills. Further
provision will also be made to insure
the money for the purpose for which it
is appropriated.
The discussion of the proposed appro
priation was the Hrst business of Im
portance transacted yesterday at the
meetine of the Hoard of Supervisors.
Supervisor Lackmann moved that the
rules be suspended and that he be per
mitted to Introduce a resolution. Per
mission was granted, and he moved the
adoption of a resolution providing that
$125,000 be set aside in the next tax
levy for the condemnation and pur
chase of the land which is now the
plague spot of the central part of the
city. In moving the adoption of his
resolution Supervisor Lackmann urged
that representatives of the St. Mary's
Park Association be heard.
Rev. Father Otis then addressed the
Mayor and the Supervisors. The rev
erend gentleman outlined the long
struggle that has been going on to rid
the city of the Dupont-street plague.
He characterized the evil as a criminal
pest which has brought shame to the
people of the city and is existing as a
menace to morals and decency. It is a
blotch upon the community%and may
be removed only by annihilation.
Father <>tis showed that the moral
sentiment of the community Is aroused
and nothing but success can end the
agitation. "As long as these shacks re
main," he said, "there is danger of a
revival of the evil. As long as our
petty police courts do as they do, and I
mean In particular Departments 2 and
?., this district will be a menace to the
city. I ask you to help us to destroy it.
We want from you $125,000 and we will
secure the rest."
Rev. Dr. Foute followed in a brief
address reiterating what Father Otis
had said and pointing out the general
public benefit which will follow the
condemnation and confiscation of the
land.
When the reverend gentleman had
conclude d Supervisor Aigeltinger spoke.
"I am not opposed to this resolution,"
he said. "On the contrary I am In
favor of it, but I fear that we cannot
make such a large appropriation and
remain within our pledge of a dollar
levy. I think that $100,000 would be suf
ficient."
Supervisor Perrault assured his asso
ciate that th<- Finance Committee of
the board had considered the matter
and was certain that the levy of $125,
--000 could be made and the pledge Still
honored. Supervisor Phelps believed
that the matter should be referred to
the Finance Committee, but his belief
was not shared by the other members
of the board. The resolution was put
to a vote and was adopted unanimous
ly, even Phelps voting for it. So the
Supervisors stand pledged to appropri
ate $125,000 for the park in the next tax
levy.
PERRAULT EXPOSES A
PECULIAR CONDITION
BIG DEriCIT IN FIRE AND PO-
LICE TELEGRAPH FUND.
Thousands of Dollars Worth of Cable
Purchased in Small Lots on
Requisition.
Supervisor Perrault handed up a nice
little problem for the board to solve at
yesterday's meeting. He stated that as
chairman of the Finance Committee ne
bad a bill regarding which he wanted the
advice of the entire board.
Dr. Perrault explained that Superin
tendent Hewitt of the Klre Alarm and
Police. Telegraph had been authorized to
Bpend $20,000 for an underground circuit.
This had ail been spent and there were
now in his hands bills for cable amount
ing to J.K227 30, which, if ordered paid,
would make a deficiency of $8349 ]6. The
cable instead of being advertised for and
purchased by contract had ail boon
bought by requisition in small lots to keep
within the law. The Supervisor regarded
this as a remarkable proceeding:, but as
the cable had been delivered unless tne
board created a deficiency by ordering its
payment the firm from fhich 1% was
purchased would have to suffer.
None of the Supervisors had any ad
vice to offer Dr. Perrault as to what he
should do and It was finally decided to
turn the bills over to the Fire Depart
ment Committee for investigation.
Supervisor Holland offered a resolution
granting Bateman Brothers an extension
of sixty days on their contract for build-
Ing the Hall of Justice on condition that
FIRE DEPARTMENT
GIVEN A SCORING
Sensational Charges Made by Some
Prominent Business Men.
Contracts for Supplies Ignored and Heavy Purchases
Made From a Favored Firm -Only 10 Per
Cent of Hardware Bid Upon.
AN explosion occurred during the
meeting of the Board of Supervis
ors yesterday, which, if the charges
made by reputable business men in
open session are substantiated, promises
to shake t\\p Fire Department from cen
ter to circumference.
The assertion was boldly made in writ
ing that the grossest fraud exists and has
existed for a long timeâ probably yearsâ
In the purchasing of supplies for the Fire
Department. The assertion was denied
by the heads of the department who were
present, to be sure, but not in a way that
carried conviction to the Supervisors, and
the matter will be given a thorough ven
tilation.
It was charged that although the Fire
Department is supposed to advertise for
anything needed in the way of supplies
not morn than 10 per cent of the articles
actually needed, particularly in hardware,
is actually enumerated in the bids, while
90 per cent is purchased in open market
at prevailing market rates, and that one
firm in this city enjoys a monopoly of
this fat patronage of this Fire Depart
ment.
After disposing of the street railway
franchisee and other Important matters
the beard settled down to routine busi
ness, and among other matters was the
passage t*> print of the t.iils for supplies
for the Fire Department as recommended
by committee. When the bids came up
for consideration by the committee last
week it was shown that tne proposals for
furnishing hardware in many Instances
were excessively high, varying from 60
to 200 per cent above present market.
rat>-s. Moreover, suspicion was aroused
by the fact that the. bids of two competi
tors, while away above market rates,
were tiie .-nine. This was particularly no
ticeable in small articles, for furnishing
winch they were the only bidders. Chief
Sullivan had quietly Bent around to the
various linns, and obtained market price
lists of the various articles bid upon, and
when tile bids were read off a compari
son readily showed tiie discrepancy.
The two firmsâ J. A. Snook & Co. and
J. F. Wulzenâ were accused of collusion
for the purpose of raiding the treasury,
and tiie committee determined to recom
mend tiie rejection of bids for all articles
on which suspicion was attached, award
ing contracts to the lowest bidder only
on such things as were shown to be with
in prevailing rates.
The suspected merchants were present
yesterday, determined to clear themselves
of the imputation of collusion and a.l the
same time exploit certain conditions pre
vailing in the Fire Department that i<_w
outsiders were aware of.
Several bids were passed to print, in
cluding that for hose, despite the pro
test ot the Goodyear Rubber Company,
which claimed its bid was the same as
that of the Bowers Rubber Company, to
which was awarded the contract; and
then the hardware schedule was reached.
Instantly there was a clamor for recog
nition from the waiting merchants. Tijj
rules were suspended in order to givj
them a hearing, and a representative of
J. A. Snoiik & In. read a long statement,
which was afterward filed with the clerk
of xhft board. The statement denied any
collusion with Wulzen or anybody else.
It recited the fact that the bids were fur
a period "f two years; that the market
was constantly advancing and was lik>-iy
to advance much higher, which fact had
to be taken into consideration; that i>n
some articles called for the cost of ad
vertising was actually more than the to
tal value of such articles supplied to the
department.
Supervisor Byington questioned the gen
tleman at considerable length. The latter
stated that his tlrm was vie lowest bid
der on eighty-one items and the fire com
mittee had recommended the award of
but five Items. If the committee's recom
mendation was adopted he would ask
leave to withdraw his bid. He said tne
department did not advertise for any
where near all the hardware supplies, It
required and when Mr. Byington called
his attention to the great difference be
tween his figures and those of Dunham,
Carrigan & Co. he replied that If the
Fire Department would agree to purchase
all the hardware supplies not called for
in the bids from his firm at market rates
he would willingly furnish the articles he
had been awarded free of cost.
Attorney T. D. Riordan, who represent
ed J. F. Wulzen, was next permitted to
address the board. He, too, had a writ
ten statement, the reading of which was
what caused the explosion. There, was
no mincing of words, or concealment of
names, and figures were quoted to sub
stantiate the charges.
Beginning with a sweeping denial of the
charge of collusion and showing how such
would be impossible, it accused tin?
heads of the Fire Department of purchas
ing all of the supplies for hardware not
called for in the bids, and even much that
had bef<n awarded to other firms, to the
Dunham, Carrigan & Hayden Company.
In proof of this assertion the statement
recited that although Wulzen had been
awarded the contract for many articles
last year, his bill against the Fire Depart
they execute an nr<ler for $5000 which they
shall forfeit if the building Is not com
pleted by September 1. The contractors
also agree tr> allow the furnishing con
tractors free access to the building from
now on so that th<Â» structure will be ready
for occupancy on that date.
("nllins offered a resolution providing
that managers ami stockholders of cours
ing parks be permitted to receive
bets and wagers and sell auction pools on
coursing matches in this city ana county
sixty days in the. year. This will open the
parks every Sunday and on holidays
throughout the year. There la likely to
be a lively fight when the resolution
comes up for final passage.
The. proposals called for recently for hy
drants, bends, gates and forgings for the
fire department were rejected because of
their excessive figures. The chief En
gineer was authorized to manufacture
them instead.
The Spring Valley Water Company was
requested to lay water mains and hy
drants alone Q street South, between Fif
teenth and Eighteenth avenues South.
The San Francisco Gas Company was
ordered to move a lamp post at 1373 Eddy
street.
The Tax Collector was authorized to
spend $1500 during the month of July.
A resolution was introduced by Perrault
allowing the Tax Collector $1500 a month
to the end of the year to conduct his of
fice. Tax Collector Sheehan asked for
$2500 a month.
The Treasurer was empowered to trans
fer from the coupon account of the City
Hall construction bonds to the sinking
fund for the redemption of those bonds
$120128 after the amount for the redemp
tion of the bonds and the account' has
been met find provided for. '? ',
The following order was adopted:
Whereas, In the collection of personal
property taxes by the .Assessor amounting
at this time to about $497,348 22, It Is
deemed proper and expedient, as no appor
tionment can be made until the time of
fixing the tax levy on the third Monday In
September, 1839, to empower the Treasurer
to use the moneys bo collected by the As
sessor as and for personal property taxes
on and after July 1, 1*99. for the payment of
salaries; also for goods; wares, merchan
dise and labor supplied the city and county
during the fiscal year commencing: July 1,
1899; and -n the fixing of the levy and the
collection of taxes to apportion .the amount
received to the several funds and accounts
. and transfer from the moneys collected for
city and county purposes the amount due
as State moneys; therefore, â â â ,-.
Resolved, That the Treasurer be and he
i ment for the months of April and May
i amounted to only about $100, while Dun
ham-Carrigan's bill amounted to $1390.
Wulzer would agree to furnish the same
i articles now, even at the advanced mar
', ket price, for $1000, and said he would
â¢ make a good profit on it.
The statement flatly charged that not
; over 10 per cent of the hardware used by
' the department was supplied by contract,
all the rest being bought in open market,
: supposedly, but in reality was purchased
| exclusively of the Dunham, Carrigan &
I Harden Company.
The reading this statement caused a
; decided sensation among the members of
the board, and Perrault called upon Mr.
\\ ulzen, who was in attendance, to sub
: stantiate it if he could. Mr. Wulzen
promptly replied that he had secured the
figures relative to purchases for April and
May from the Auditor's books and they
| were easy to verify.
Perrault demanded to know who was
responsible for these purchases and Wul
zen replied that he supposed Chief Sulli
van was. Wulzen went on to say that
some of the articles that had been award
ed to Snook & Co. last year had been
bought from Dunham, Carrigan & Hay
den by the department at 100 per cent
above the contract price. Dunham, Carri
gan & Hayden. he said, could afford
to give the articles bid on to the depart
ment In return for the monopoly they en
joyed. He reiterated the assertion that
only 10 per cent of the supplies wire
awarded by contract; all the rest were
bought in open market and all went to
the Dunham, Carrigan &. Hayden Com
pany.
Mr. Wulzen produced a bill purporting
to give prices charged by Dunham, Cani
gan & Hayden, among the items being
$1 CO for a single door knob; when a whole
lock could be bought for $1.25. Light T
hinges, which had been awarded to Snook
for 2 cents each Wulzen asserted were
purchased of Dunham-Carrigan for $1 20
each and there were many other exorbi
tant charges given. Articles were con
tracted for but were not supplied under
contract or by the contractor.
Mr. Wulzen's statement read by his at
torney, together with the hill he quoted
â¢ from, were filed with Clerk Russell, and
then Chief Sullivan was called upon for
an explanation. The Chief denied that he
had any authority to purchase supplies
by requisition and said that rested en
tirely with the heads of departments.
Articles could be purchased without his
knowledge. He thought the bids included
about everything needed with a few
minor exceptions and he was positive that
90 per cent was not omitted from the con
tracts.
Peter H. Fleming, clerk of the Corpora
tion Yard, was positive there had been
nothing wrong iii the purchase of sup
plies for his department.. He was of the
.opinion that the hardware purchased in
open market during April and May would
not amount to more than $luO. Not more
than 5 per cent of what he purchased
was outside of tho contract.
John W. Reilly, superintendent of en
gines and machinery, admitted, after
much pressure by Perrault, that many
needed articles were omitted from the
bids and had to be bought in open mar
ket.
Perrault moved that all bids for hard
ware be rejected and the matter referred
to the Merchants' Association and the
board's expert to prepare a new sched
ule. Byington objected to delegating the
power of- the board to the Merchants'
Association, but Perrault called his at
tention to the street sweeping contract,
Which was given over to the Merchants'
Association.
Collins asked if the board under the
terms of the proposal could reject part of
the bids.
Mayor Phelan proceeded to read one
portion of the proposal and construed it
as being against Collins 1 contention, when
he was brought up with a turn by Per
rault, who reminded him that it was his
duty to preside over the board and not
to argue on any matter up for considera
tion. The Mayor then read the last
clause of the award, which expressly
stated that the board reserved the right
to reject all bids, and Perrault accepted
an amendment to his motion rejecting all
bids.
The Mayor said that certain contracts
for supplies had been passed to print al
ready, and Perrault moved that a reso
lution be prepared rescinding such action.
Mayor Phelan said the vote would have
to be reconsidered, and Collins moved
that it be reconsidered at once. It was
ruled out and Collins appealed from the
decision of the chair.
Perrault insisted that the resolution
Clerk Russell had prepared, rescinding
the vote, be acted upon, and finally the
Mayor backed down from his position,
saying it could be rescinded, as the
awards had only been passed to print.
The resolution rescinded the. action pass
ing to Drlnt such awards as had been
acted upon, rejected all bids and referred
the matter to the Merchants' Association
and the expert. It was adopted, but later
the board decided to award such con
tracts as were in reason and not dis
puted and reject all the bids for hard
ware and hose.
There will be an Investigation now and
some startling disclosures are likely.
Is hprehy empowered and requested to lisa
on and after July 1, 1899, the moneys col

property taxes for the payment of sal

amount due an State moneys.
Further resolved, That Dip attention of
the Auditor and Treasurer lu> and is here
by called to the provisions of this resolu
tion.
A resolution was adopted requesting the
Market Street Railway Company to report
to? the board the kind of guards used on
its electric cars, and whether any of the
guards prescribed by Order No. 60 have
been or are now used.
The Treasurer was authorized to pay
S!S7/ 10 out of the general fund to the

street light fund for lighting public streets
