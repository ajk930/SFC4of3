LONDON, Dec. 14.â Tbe Daily Telegraph publishes this dispatcb from
its special correspondent :
MODDER RIVER, Tuesday, Dec. 12.â We attacked the Boers
yesterday. It is estimated 'â¢hat they were 12.000 strong. They are
occupying very strong positions six miies to the northeast in the Ma
gersfontein Kopjas
The Highland brigade advanced before dawn to storm the line of
the Boer trenches. It got to the base of the Kopjes, but was re
pulsed with heavy loss. I regret to state tbat General Wauchope,
commanding th>e brigade, was K'l'ed. Our artillery, consisting of four
batteries and a naval gun, shelled tr;e enemy's position. Methuen's
force then tried to break through th>e Boer's left flank between the
kopjes and Modder River, but tr;e Boers were too strong.
Tbe attack on th>e enemy's front, where th>e higb'and brigade fyad
failed in the rrjorning, was pressed all day. The Gordon Higb'aQders
rr)ade a heroic attempt to retrieve the previous failure. Colonel Down
man with a few of his n)en got within 200 yards of tbe trenches, but
could not get any further. Tbe colonel was mortally wounded.
Tbe brigade having lost very beavily in officers and rr)en retired
and returned this rooming to the general camp bere. The guns and
the Guards brigade covered tbe retirement.
Our losses are very heavy. The Marquis of Winchester is among
the Killed.
Th>e force engaged in tbe battle consisted of tY)e Guards brigade,
Highland brigade, Eighteenth), Sixty-second and Seventy-fifth field bat
teries, a battery of tbe Royal horse Artillery, Ninth and Twelfth Lan
cers and a bowitzer battery.
killed. Their fine fighting quality was
shown, bowever, by the tact that despite
the bad tactics which had brought <lt>,is

position, which had In the meantime bOCP
â helled by three Held batteries, howitzers,

At this point the Boen delivered a
counter ;ittHck on the British tlank and
â¢ Qordoni l r 'st their oolonel and fell
back, i>ut the Boen were met by the
(Guards and artillery and were driven
back. The British held their own until

Delegations from the Qrand Lodges of
every State and Territory. a.Â« w.ll as from
many foreign countries, will attend.
Three lodges will be honored above all
. others in the celebration. These will be:
Alexandria Washington Lodge No. 22. of
which Washington was first inafter and a
'charter member; Predefftcksbovg tVa.)
I Lodge No. 4. Into which he was Initiated;
j and Federal Lodge No. 1, D. of C. which

The Masonic bodies will proceed to

The next clay. Sunday, Impresario Wil
son, leading "his Manila ' Minstrelsâ the
"Century's Cluster <<( Adorable Artists,"
visited the sick ward and the convales
cent ward of the hospital. Songs and
; recitations wen giVen to " refresh and
, cheer the weary and worn. The sick men
manifested their gratitude In many ways.
At a critical moment of the campaign
: the Southern Pacific Railroad distinguish
ed itself for courtesy. It was ascertained
when the column reached Yountville Sat
urday morning that a box of musical In
struments had been shipped by freight
instead of express. Agent Phillips at
Yountvllle promptly used the wires to in
! voice the aid of Freight Traffic Manager
William Sproule. Impresario Wilson also
brought the long distance telephone to
bear on Mr Sproule. The result was that
j the Southern Pacific management located
; the freight car, detached the box and
forwarded the instruments by passenger
' train In time to save the country.
In the handling of commissary supplies
producers and consumers were brought
â  together In the valley. The directors pro
duced the supplies and the minstrels con
sumed them. The outing was a happy one
, all around. The Manila Minstrels have
blazed the way for other representatives
of accomplished society to do something
highly creditable, somewhat novel and al
together enjoyable. The ladies on the
reservation gave a concert at the Home
theater Sunday afternoon, which delight
ed their guests. A little spread given
after the Saturday night performance was
well spoken of by the neighbors.
In recording the achievements of the
outing Uncle George T. Bromley mentions
that the sweetest singers that ever trav
eled sang at one theater. In two railroad
cars, at five stations and on two ferry

they will not cease their efforts to se

tlemen are the membership committee of
; the association. In addition to the an
nouncement cf their intentions concern
Ing the size of the membership they de
sire and think possible they also set forth
a plan of organization work. They pro
pose to establish in every city, town and
village In the State a branch of the as
' sociation, with such organization as such
I branches may determine upon. It Is nec
l essary, they find, that there should be
j 25,000 members, for the money Is needed
and al3o influence as well as membership
fees. Every member of the convention

the formation of a branch. When fifty

When these have been given, he will turn
to the representatives of th.- States from

YELLOW FEVER
ON MANY SHIPS
Hard Luck Stories Told
at Astoria.
EDENBALLYMORE'S PLIGHT
CAPTAIN, MATE AND TWO OF
THE CREW SUCCUMB.
Special Dlipatch to The Call.
ASTORIA. Or., Dec. 13.â Nearly all the
vessels of ;hc fall grain fleet now arriv
ing here from Panama report losses at
â  that port from yellow fever. Two Panama
ships, the long overdue St. â¢ Enoch and
the Edenballymore. arrived to-day, the
former late to-night. The crew of tne
Edenballymore has a particularly sad
story to relate, six of her complement
having succumbed to the ravages of the
isthmian rceurge.
The EdÂ»'nballymore arrived at Panama
i on July 17 and sailed for Astoria on Octo
ber 13. While lying In Panama harbor
twenty of her crew were stricken with
the dreaded disease and of that' number
fix died. The Oral ease broke out aboard
the vessel on August 12. The patient was
a man, who was sent tsboV< for treat
ment. On the ISth he died. Toward the
end of the month Mrs. Way, wife of the
Edenballymorr-'s captain, was taken ill
, and on .September 3 she passed away.
Captain W;.y contracted the disease while
attending Mrs. Way und on September .'â¢
he. too. Â«uccumbed. Between August ik
and September 13 three men of the crew
died. Including the mate. There were two
cases of malarial fever on the ship when
the arrived to-day and she was ordered
into quarantine.
The St. Enoch did not get into the har
bor until late to-night, and pending an
l examination of the ship by Quarantine
Officer Hastings no one was permitted to
board or leave the vessel. Hera has been
a remarkable passage. She left Panama
nearly 1W days ago and has been off the
Columbia for four weeks, unable to make
port owing to the gale. Before she ever
reached thÂ« river she was given up by
many, who thought yellow fever had car
ried off her crew. Since arriving off tho
river several vessels have given the St.
Enoch provisions. Doubtless her crew
has a hard luck story to relate, but It will
not come out until to-morrow.
Ten per cent reinsurance had been of
fered on her in San Francisco, and she
proved a good speculation for the brokers
The vessel reported ashore at Loomla
Station last night proved to be the British
ship Craigmore. which arrived this morn
ing. She had a narrow escape from de
struction. Since the wreck of the light
ship two weeks ago vessels have mistaken
the north head light for that of the light
ship, with the result that several ships
have had close calls. The Craigmore was
almost In the breakers when the captain
got his bearings and distress rockets were
rent up. Tim tug Wallula went to the
rescue and towed the ship safely Into the
: harbor.
The German bark Sfnstern had even a
narrower escape than the Craigmore. for
; she was well Into the breakers when as

been severe both vessels would now oc

Denies That He Has Inflamed the

and the People.
BERLIN, Dec. 13.â 1n the Reichstag to
day there was a continuation of the
budget debate. Dr. Yon Mlque.l. the Min
ister of Finance, replied to the criticisms
of the Emperor's Hamburg speech made
by Dr. Lleber. the Centrist leader. He said
the speech had found a patriotic echo in
the hearts of millions of Germans and had
been â  warning against the excessive
grow th of the power of party politics. The
speaker said he was not responsible for
the speech. This was a case In which th*
hmperor needed no counselor. The navy
bill, as announced, was not beyond the
tlnanctal strength of Germany, and the
t entrusts, he asserted, would ultimately
admit the necessity of it.
Herr Rattler, in'behalf of the National
Liberals, said he hailed with great satis
faction the favorable sentiments of Amer
ica toward Germany, adding:
"Since, however. America formerly went
very far in repressing German Interests. it
is America against whom we must I
strengthen our power."

SUCCEEDS BROOKE
AS GOVERNOR GENERAL
Leonard Wood of Santiago Fame Assigned
to Entire Command of the Island
of Cuba.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 13.â 8y direction of the President. Leonard Wood,
major general of volunteers, was to-day assigned to the command of
the division of Cuba, relieving Major General John R. Brooke, U. S. A.
Major General Wood, in addition to his duties as division commander,
will exercise the authority of Military Governor of the island.
On completion of the transfer of the command Major General Brooke is
ordered to repair to this city and report to the adjutant general of the army for
further orders of the Secretary of War. He will be accompanied by his author
ized aids.
In relieving Major General Brooke the President desires to express his high
appreciation of and thanks for the faithful and efficient service rendered by
that officer as Military Governor of Cuba.
Secretary Root said this afternoon that General Brooke had been ordered to
Washington, but beyond that nothing had been settled with regard to his assign
ment. His presence In this city Is desired by the President for the purpose of
securing information in regard .to the actual condition of affairs In Cuba. Al
though Secretary Root would not admit it. the Impression prevails that General
Brooke will be assigned to the command of the military Department of tho-
I^akes, with headquarters at Chicago, a position held by him prior to the out
break of the Spanish war and known to be agreeable to him in every respect.
General Wood called at the War Department this afternoon and personally
thanked Secretary Root for the honor conferred upon him by his selection as Mil
itary Governor of Cuba. He said that he would start for Havana at once and. if
possible, would leave New York City to-morrow.

WITNESSES HEARD
AGAINST ROBERTS
9
Polygamous Status of
the Mormon.
Â»
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 13.â The commit
tee of the House of Representatives which
is investigating the case of Roberts of
Utah began the examination of witnesses
at 10:30 to-day. A large number of spec
tators were present, including many la
dles. Roberts occupied a seat at the foot
of the committee table, while flanking
him was the delegation of Gentilesâ X.v.
Dr. Illff, Schroeder. and othersâ here to
direct the attention of Congress to the
member-elect.
When Chairman Tnyler of Ohio called
the committee to order and asked what
witness.-* would 1,,- heard Roberts arose
and asked to be informed as to his status
before the committee. He made a short
statement in line with his belief, which
has already been published.
Taylor responded that all of Roberts'
rights had been fully looked after and
protected and there was no proper ques
tion which had not been raised.
Tayler then asked Schroeder what wit
nesses he would call.
"Does .his man appear as attorney?"
asked Roberts.
"He will examine witnesses," explained
Tayler.
"Then I wish to Introduce the court rec
ord relating to him," said Roberts
Tayler .-..id this had already been parsed
on Saturday and Schroeder had been rec
ognised.
Charles Austin Owen was then called.
Â»Ie gave his residence as Salt Lake CUy.
In response to questions by Schroeder lie
â aid ho knew the general reputation In
bait l,ake City of the status ot "Dr. Mag
gie C. Shipp Roberts." The witness i.id
that the general reputation of the status
of Roberts and Dr. Maggie C. Shipp Roo
erts was that they maintained the rela
tion of husband and wlie. While he
questions were being nut as to Mrs. Mag
gie Roberts, Roberts interrupted with the
objection: â¢
"What this lady may have done Is im
material in the absence of any showing
that it was at the direction of IS. H. Rob
erts. ,
Schroeder said later testimony would
"i l^ out the materiality of the questions
and Taylor ruled that the competency of
the questions could be Judged by the sub
sequent testimony. The witness was then
cross-examined by Roberts, whose ques
i tions brought out that the witness had
no personal knowledge as to Mrs. Maggie
Roberts or Roberts based on talks with
them, but his information was general
j and of common repute.
"I want to know," said Roberts, "If the
general reputation you have been testify
, ing to obtains since March 4. ISVJ."
"It does."
"And what is that reputation?"
"That Maggie C. Shipp Roberts is the
plural or polygamous wife of Brighara H.
Roberts." , â¢â  - .-.,.;
"On what acts in this general reputation :
based?" inquired Roberts. ;
"No specific acts, but generally accepted
reputation," responded Owen.
There was considerable testimony on
court prosecutions throughout the State
on which the witness had Information.
As his evidence dosed Roberts asked m
have all this testimony struck from the,
record, as the witness was unable to tes
tify to his own knowledge. The chairman
permitted the testimony to stand.
Arthur McKwen of the Philadelphia
North American was examined as to a
recent Interview with Roberts, signed by
ll m (McEwenj. In this Roberts spoke of
his 'wives." referring to them as "good
and true women," toward whom obliga
tions had been incurred prior to the en
actment of the polygamy law.
"Wan not this conversation in reference
to general conditions?" asked Roberts
â¢on. no, .vir. Roberts." answered the
witness, directly addressing his interro
gator, "You spoke of general conditions
and used your own case to Illustrate."
Captain Ellas H. Parsons of the Quar
termaster Department. U. S. A., testified i
to an Incident occurring in 1S1Â«6. while he
was in Salt Lake City. About Sam i
some one asked him to call up on his
telephone Dr. Haggle C. Shipp Roberts
On going to th.- telephone and calling up*
the house a man's voice answered
"Who Is this?" Captain Parsons' asked !
over the telephone.
"B. 11. Roberts." was the reply.
On cross-examination Roberts asked*
"Do you know M. H. Roberts' voice?"
"I do not."
"Did the answer over the telephone say
'Brtgham 11. Roberts?' " |
"No, simply B. 11. Roberts." \
"Is th.re not a Bolivar Roberts In Salt '
Lake ( 1 1 y . "
"Yes, but I would know Bolivar Roberts'
voice at any time, and it was not his "
Roberts said he would later ask to have
this testimony stricken out as irrelevant
and not on personal knowledge
Rev. Dr. Illft. a Methodist missionary of
Utah, testified that the general reputa
tion as to the status of Cella Dibble Rob- i
crts was that she was the plural wife
of Brigham H. Roberts. â ; '
On cross-examination Roberts Bought to
dhow that Dr. Iliff was hostile to the Mor
mons, the witness stating that his hos
tility was to the polygamous feature or
Mormonlsm. .' .
Dr. Illft went into the historical fea
tures of the content against polygamy, tno
Utah Constitutional Convention, the atti
tude of Governor Wells and the \\ ells-
Roberts discussion on polygamy. Â£>r.
IMff denied that there had been an inten
tional withholding of prosecution in Li Â»n
in order to get up a propaganda in the
Kast and thus increase the contributions
for missionary work.
Rev. W. G. Martin, a Presbyterian min
ister of Manti. Utah, testified as to the
reputation of polygamous status or
Celia Dibble Roberts and Dr. Margaret C.
Shipp Roberts toward Hrigham li. Rob
erts. He saw statements to this effect In
the Salt Lake City papers and heard of no
denials. The polygamous status of Rob
erta was a matter of common repute. It
was reputed thai twins had been born to
Celia Dibble Roberts.
Schroeder stated that was all the evi
dence nt hand until witnesses arrived
from Utah.
Roberts said <x-l'nlted States Senator
Drown, a non-Mormon and a member of
the Republican organization of Utah, was
In town and could furnish Information on
general conditions In Utah; also D. C
Dunbar. clerk of the court at Salt Lake
City, and Mr. Glass Of that city.
Chairman Taylor said the inquiry would
be confined to matters affecting Roberts
and the broad Held of general conditions
In Utah would not be entered at present.
At 1 o'clock the committee went Into exec
utive session prior to adjourning for the
day.
In the course of the hearing TayleÂ»r said
to Roberts that the hitter's demurrer had
been overruled, all questions being taken
into consideration for determination later.

Case.
NEW YORK Dec. 13.â 1n th trial of
Roland B. Mollneux. charged with the
murder of Mrs. Katherine J. Adam.*, the
direct examination of Handwriting Expert
William J. Kinsley was concluded. The ;
proceedings were enlivened by the ap
pearance as a witness of Robert Stephen
Holt, a flour merchant. It was during the |
examination of this witness that the name

the trial for the first time.
Mr Holt had testified that the late Hen
ry C. Barnet. who died at the Knicker
bocker Athletic Club about a year ago.

& Co.; had identified certain letters as be
ing In the handwriting: of the deceased.
a , nd . u on cross-examination by Mr.
Weeks had testified that a lady from out
Of town had called upon him at his Lex
ington avenue residence some time in No
vember.
The object of this particular line of
cross-questioning evidently puzzled As- |
sistant District Attorney Osborne. for he
Immediately seized the opportunity to ex
amine the witness about Mrs. Molineux '
Mr. Holt said that he had known her
when she was Blanche Chesebrough: that !
he had met her several times at the
Knickerbocker Athletic Club. In reply to
Mr. Osbornc's questions the witness testi
fied that on one occasion ho had been in '
Barnets room at the club when Miss
ChesebrotiKh . was there. The witness,
Barnet, Miss Chesebrough and another
woman had been attending an entertain- !
ment at the club and had visited Barnet's
room. Barnet and Miss Chesebrough re- |
mained In the rooms alone together.
The witness remembered that there was
part of a bottle of champ. on the table
when he was there.

TACOIfA, Dec. 13.â Alexander Clark*,
an Englishman, 30 years old, was Instant,
ly killed at Steveston this mornln*. He
was a highly educated, aristocratic Brit
on, who came to British Columbia to!
learn ranching. He was holding a cow be
longing to H. Webber, a butcher, which !
was about to bÂ« slaugntered by Clarke's
friend. Paul Jones. Jones shouted" to '
Clarke to stand ready and. raising ins I
rifle to his shoulder, took careful aim and
fired. The same Instant the cow, prob- 1
ably wondering what It was all about, :
turned head slowly toward Clarke. Al
though the unfortunate Englishman was
five feet away, the bullet, after strik'r.g
the cow's forehead, glanced off and pene- '
trated Clarke's temple, killing him In
ptantly. Coroner McGulgan will hold an
Inquest, but there Is no doubt the killing
was accidental.

Secretary Mason's report of the. condi

City Clerk Lamborn of Alameda. State
organizer of the league, announced that
he had visited sixty-four cities of Cali
fornia In the Interest of the organization,
principally In the line of prevailing upon
them to Join the league and contribute
financial support. Most of the people
whom he approached upon the subject
looked upon It at first as a political prop
osition, and it took considerable explain
ing on hi* part to set them straight
However, he said, since he had Rot the
cities educated up to the benefits and oh.
Jects of the league they could not bo kept
from joining.
Mayor Snow of Oakland followed with
a paper on "The Future Work of the
League." In part he. said:
There Is need of the l<>!iÂ«uÂ». The muni
cipal officer* of this State need It I do
not know how It ik in every cub*, but to
be an officer iii many cities Is to have
honor mixed with opprobrium. The loud
election-day acclaim la i>oon changed to
looks of vexation and surprise. st hI wart
advocates of reform, but with an eye to
the Tin: in chance, are often disappointed
and BOOH â USIIIII the rank* of the po
litical opposition, wishing for and prophe
pylnK th- early downfall of the admlnls
tratlon. There Is atrenirth and. satisfac
tion In the consciousness of duty done,
i.vi the municipal ofllcer needs more up
lift than this to counterbalance the down
pull of the jealous and disappointed. He
needs the strength that comes to every
man by contact with men of like pur
pose*. He needs tliHr support. He needs
to know what they know.
The problem of city government is con- '
â¢ fined to no single city. The experience of
â¢â¢ach and every municipality in our own
State Is of especial Interest to us all aa
municipal officers. Samuel Johnson said:
"Knowledge is of two kinds. We know a
subject ourselves or we know where we
' can find Information upon It." Few of
us. it any. have been trained In the work
which we have bÂ«en chosen to perform.
We actually know but little about it.
Where shall we get â  reliable information
upon It? You know that It Is not uncom
mon to receive a return postal card from
tome sister city setting forth the fact
that the Inquirer finds himself Ignorant,
and almost pathetically begging you. with
300 or 400 others, to tell him upon a postal
card, half as big as your hand, what you

be pitifully slow and unsatisfactory. To

orphan asylums have come to be main
tained by many municipalities as a matter
of course, while other cities of even greater
size have none of these and need the stimu
li.!- of example to undertake them.
Joseph Hutchinson, chairman of the '
board of trustees, suggested needed
changes in 'he bylaws of the league. He
advocated the choice of â  San Francisco
bank as treasurer; that provision should
be made for the compensation for the
secretary, at least; that the selection of
place if meeting should be left to the con
vention Instead of the executive commit
tee. Article 10 of the bylaws should be
so amended, he said, that a committee of
lawyers could be appointed to consider
needed legislation and draft bills to be
submitted to the convention before intro
duction to the Legislature of 1901. He con
cluded with a motion that the chair
should appoint â  committee of three to
draft amendments to the bylaws and pre
sent them for action of the convention on
the last day of the session.
The motion carried, the chair appointing
Mr. Hutchlnson. C. N. Kirkbrlde of San
Mateo and H. A Mason of Santa Clara,
Some very pointed remarks on the Vroo
man act and the police pension act were
made by Mayor Eaton of Los Angeles. In
part he said:
We are so far away down In Los Angeles
that we know nothing of this organisation
until Organizer Lamborn came down our way
several months aS" We could not under
stand fully from him what It was all about,
so I came here to find out. Speaking about
needed changes In the laws affecting mu
nicipalities. It Is my opinion that the Vroo
man act should be repealed. It I* cumber
some and extremely unsatisfactory. One
of the principal objections to It Is that It
Is too technical. A serious defect In It Is
that the Street Superintendent Is placed In
charre of all street Improvements, while
the engineer who designs and plans the
work has nothing to do with its execution.
For years Loi Aneeles worked under an
old charter shaped after the charters of
nome <â '. the Eastern <.-iti**. It was simple
and natlFfartory and we accomplished many
Improvements. As noon as we were forced
to make our Improvements under the pro
visions of the Vrooman act. the cost of
street work went up over M l>*r cent.
The police pension law Is another that
should be repealed. It makes police Jobs
too desirable. 1 have found that the men
who have been most anxious to get the
appointments Â»re the fellows who are hunt-
Ing for a soft thing, and when they get In
office they never make the best men for the
places, The law has had the opposite ef
fect to that for which It was Intended, If
It was prompted by any motives of welfare
to the communities which It affect?. There
Is no renÂ« n why police should be pensioned.
They are in no great danger. Their uniform
Is a protection to them, and you seldom hear
of one of them getting killed while doing
his duty.
Much applause created th*> announce
ment from the Southern Mayor that the
feellnp in favor of State division had en
tirely disappeared in his section of the
country. by Mayor Brooks of Marysville
A papÂ«*r by Mayor Brnnks of Marysvlllo
was read by the secretary. in part it
ran:
ThÂ« meeting In convention of representa
tives from different municipalities, each
with its own peculiar institutions, fitted to
the locn! condition! prevailing at each place,
cannot fall to result in an exchange of Idea*
and methods mutually beneficial to all. and
In giving each city an opportunity to adopt
for Itself the very best practices prevailing
elsewhere We expect our annual meetings
to he largely experience meeting*, and doubt
not that every member In returning to his
home will carry with him more new Ideas
about Rood municipal government than he
ever dreamed of before.
A permanent bureau should be established
with a salaried secretary to collect and
classify and distribute Information about
what our cities are doinc. an. l about the
thousand and one things for which city of
ficial* are constantly In search.
A rampalKn of education Is necessary to
let the public become familiar with our
work and Its value. On. â â¢â  understood, popu
lar approval cnnnot lon* be withheld. Much
(rood work for the benefit of the league ran
be done by volunteer effort.
Through special committees we would ac
complish division of labor, subjects being
assigned to those 'ally Interested In
handling them. If arrangements could be
made for frequent publication of the com
mittees' proceedings, the public would be
â¢ kept. Interested In our work .and a larger
number of people would be reached through
the publications than would ever attend one
of our conventions. ,
Lewis F. Bylngton made a few remarks
on the benefits of cheap streetcar far.
and the rights of municipalities to regu
late them.
George Hansen of Berkeley told of the
opportunities Oakland had to secure valu
able park sites, of which he regretted the
city across the. hay was not taking ad
vantage.
President David Starr Jordan was the
only speaker at the evening session. His
subject was "The Continuing City." The
central Idea of his address was that good
government Is the force that will enable
municipalities to continue. Bail govern- |
ment gave rise to corruption, physical and
moral. The private use .if public utilities
made it an object for some persons to de
sire bad government. While the city
ought to be the best place to live in, the i
fact was that the energy of the cities had
constantly to he recruiter, from the coun
try. He rapped Tammany hard and de
scribed It picturesquely. He dealt largely
with the school system and ridiculed the
practice of giving places to teachers sim
ply because they were in need of employ
ment.
Incidentally he alluded to the Senatorial
situation In Pennsylvania and said that
Quay ought not to be confirmed simply
to give support to the administration.
Speaking of the British Government, he
said that the war In South Africa might
have had Its origin in the tactics of a
certain British statesman who, â¢ when
things went wrong at home, diverted the
public by waving the flag and inciting
their patriotism. He believed that the
best form of city government was .where
there were many Supervisors or Council
men and the Mayor had very large pow
ers. Strong approval was given to con
ventions'of municipal officers, who were
trying to find out the best way to admin
ister municipal affairs. The great. fault of
the American people was a lack of seri
ousness, and that disqualified them from
holding their servants to strict accounta
bility He had several recommendations
for the purification of municipal politics,
which wereâ Civil service rules., making
political corruption a misdemeanor, edu
cating the community. He concluded
with the sentiment that "Vigilance Is the
price of liberty."
The convention will meet again this
morning at 10 o'clock at Pioneer Hall.
FRUIT GROWERS FAVOR
A FREE PUBLIC MARKET
Day at the Convention Largely Spent in Dis
cussing Plans for a Thorough Organi
zation of Orchardists.
SAN JOKK. Dee. U.â Local orchardists
turned oui to force to-day at the
Fruit Orowers' Convention
and when that body convened this
morning there were t>\\ vacant
â oats. There was also an Increased at
tendance of fruit men from abroad.
(Jreater interest was manifested In the
subjects under discussion.
So far no commit!. have been
received and no resolutions Introduced,
but the convention will undoubtedly take
up Its business to-morrow.
Oood results of the meeting are appar
ent on all sides. It has lent an impetus
to the deciduous fruit growers, and at a
meeting this afternoon after the conven
tion it was decided t<> call a convention of
growers of, dried fruit for the third Mon
day In January In this city. At that time
attempts will be made to effect an or
ganization to handle the entini product of
the coast.
The Marysville men are making a fight
to take the next convention to that city.
They are doing some qntol missionary
work and will probably succeed, â 
ramento and northern growers are in fa
vor of it.
The Jamaica treaty will probably be
brought i.p to-morrow and resolutions
condemning It adopted.
IT. si. lent BllWOOd Cooper pr.-.-id.-l at
the morning session and B. M. I/elong
acted as secretary.
The convention promptly got down to
business and from the opening to the
closing the proceedings were most inter
esting. The organization and co-opera
tion among producers, effect of foreign
competition and the establishment of a
free public market for the sale of perish
able products were the topics considered.
The report of Edward F. Adams of
Wrights on "The Free Public Market Pro
ject was the first number. In substance
It stated:
In the autumn of 1595 a commission firm In
San Francisco cheated a widow of Santa Cruz
County out of â¢â¢"â¢ cents on Â» box of grapes, anil
the widow objected. When reproached for Its
act the firm net up In defense. that I? whh
the custom of the trade; they all did It Out
of that ti:inwi. grew up the (treat free
imrk. t controversy. The Widow appealed to
the Santa Cruz (Jranrce. anil the matter was
taken up. The press Joined in the discussion
and a convention to consider the free market
| project was held under the auspice* of the
I Slate â  Board of Hortlcultue in San Franclnco
on April 6. MS; subsequently another conven
tion was held In that city under the auspices
of the Hoard of State Harbor Commissioners.
A law establishing a free market was placed
on the statute books on March 25. IW7. Thin
law was never compiled with. If the pro
divers of the State had even so much a* the
spirit of an angora Koat they would raise
money and attack thÂ»Â» Commissioner* by
mandamus proceedings or for malfeasance In
office.
On East street the State owns some pir>;>
erty and it was attempted to have this proo
erty xiroA as a free market. The Pacific
Steamship Company used th* property for a
coal yard and the Commissioners refused to
oust It to make room for the fruit-grower*.
The two convention* held had ur*ed thin. The
advantages of a free market would b- th*>
regulation of the . market. surrounding trans
actions with all possible safeguards aaainst
fraud hy producers or salesmen and furnish
lnirrtÂ«"dlat<> and dally Information of the. jtate
of the market for the guidance, of Intending
shippers*.
Mr. Adams was given a vote of thanks.
W. M. Alken. Edward Berwick and Major
Coulter wore appointed a committee to
consider thr report and place Its salient
feature! before the convention.
Professor C. W. Chllds read a paper on
"Deciduous Fruits." touching particular
ly upon the prune Industry or Santa Clara
County. He stated that horticulturist* of
California have, been forming combina
tions for mutual profits and protection.
These fruit corporations have generally
been of great public value, a? they are
working In the Interest of producer, con
sumer and merchant by lessening some of
the expenses and decreasing some of the
friction that is usually incident to indi
vidual competition. The speaker explain
ed the effort being made in San Jose to
form â  Pacific Coast Fruit Association to
handle all the cured prunes, apricots and
I peaches on the coast.
a. 11. Naftzger, president and general
manager of the Southern California Fruit
Exchange, spoke at length on "The Or
ganization and Co-operation of Citrus
Growers." He said In part:
Bo much has been said upon the advantages
of organization that It ought to appeal to >â â¢
Organization will stimulate friendly rivalry
among producer*. Goods well graded and
packed are half marketed. A large business
can effect a saving, especially In buying Â«up
plles.
An association can conduct business cheaper
than any one else. The entire expanses of thÂ«
Orange Growers' Association Is only 3 per cent
of Its cross sales. A few years afro our packing
cost us from 35 to 40 cents per box. but this
has been reduced to 24 an.l H cent*. WtiÂ»r# the
expenses of the association rearhed 10 per cent
of (cross rales It Is now 3 per rent This sav
ing results simply because we do a large busi
ness. Another benefit of organization la that It
reduces competition. Dtton organization the
commission men made every grower a competi
tor with every other producer.
If the prune grower* have the spirit of ro
operatlon It will be rfferte.l Siilary should cut
BO figure In Â«*i-uring a proper h>*ad for the or
ganization. The organization should be derlaiv*
in its enaracter. Â« nÂ»n orÂ»pÂ«Â» rrower* nrr*n

the men who holii the supplies, ny â¢'.hint
lion grower* Will eliminate ill the speculative
feature* between the producer an. l the market.
There Is no reason why our products should
pass through the hands of speculator*. ThÂ»
Â»>range Growers' Association sells more fruit
and sell* It for more money In all th* market*
than all the operators combined who ship from
this State. Our market eÂ»tendÂ» fr..m Victoria.
It. C. to Jacksonville. Kin . Montreal to Ista
Angeles, and to 1...r-l I,a*t year our sate*
were Â«:.::â  ">. and In all this business we n-v-r
lost one cent on bad accounts.
California fruit men should co-operate in their
several classes and then cooperate In a rÂ»nÂ«--.i:
association. The time will come when In the
Uric- (Eastern center* we will have house* to
distribute California produrt* of every â â ! iÂ«Â«.
There Is no reason why all the products of xlntt
and tree should not be sold through the mm n
airency. It would place the markets on a ateady
l>asls. It Is perfectly practicable. It I* not nee.
essary to combine at this end of the tine, but
the managing; at the end where the distribution
Is dÂ«mÂ« should be converged Into a common cen
ter In the East. Kxpenses would be reduced to
a minimum, and the sale of our dried and fresh
products would be continually pushed forward.
Vice President Alkcn presided at the
afternoon session. Professor A. I*.
Hnyne, of Berkeley addressed the conven
tion on "Prospective Competition From
the Philippine Islands." if* did not think
wo need fear much from Philippine com
petition. Rice la the most Important ar

or barley Is not raised on account of
climate. The Filipinos do not raise;
enough rice to feed tnemselves. but are
i compelled to Import 3,00">,000 pounds each
year from China.
Adjournment was then taken till to-mor
row to give thÂ»Â» committees time for work.
After the convention adjourned those In
terested in dried fruit met for the pur
pose of seeing If an organization cou'd
not be effected similar to the ralsln-grow

A BREAK IN THE RfINKS
I â IERETOFORE, since the convention of 1896. it
I J has been held as the sacred policy of the Demo
cratic party that it should refuse affiliation to
any man who was not in favor of the free coinage
of s-iher at 16 to 1. 'The divinely appointed ratio," as
one of them named it. was the test of party loyalty.
To favor any other, though the variance might be the
smaller fraction, was to be a goldbug and a rank
outsider.
With all the peculiar tyranny of fanaticism Colonel
Bsyan has judged his fellows by the ratio. No der
vish of the Soudan has ever been in more abject sub
jt-rtion to the Khalifa than Democrats to Bryan on
this issue. So completely has he usurped control of
the party organization that it is felt that any State
will be disfranchised, in the convention of 1900 if i:
refuse indorsement of the ratio. No change in the
economic and financial condition of the country has
been heckd as necessarily requiring an abatement of
the Chicago platform. At best the position of all par
ties on the money question had been dictated by the
view of expediency taken by politicians prior to 1806
Kf publican politicians like Dolliver and Thurston and
even the President himself are now obliged to confess
their derelictions on the money question because in
the past they had omitted to consider it from the
str.mbohu of fixed principle. They are now domi
nated by conditions and have to abandon theories for
fact*, and principles, and they do so frankly Not *o
with the Democracy. They stand in the midst of a
u:mersal demonstration of the error of their position
Every prediction, prophecy and forecast they mad
lias been a failure. On one side is their futile theory;
on the other the cold facts which destroy it But they
still stand shouting that it is night, while the day
shines all around them. Determined to justify their
file as Bourbons, they refuse to forget and they re
fuse to learn. This being the party situation ' the
country is treated to a surprise that ma be â  symp
tom, in the speech of Congressman Drigg s o f Brook
lyn. X. V.. in favor of the gold standard and the finan
cial reform bill now before the House.
Mr. Driggs declares th.it when nominated and dur
ing liis candidacy lie declared himself in favor of such
legislation, and as his Democratic constituency elected
him he proposes to vote his convictions. it i s t h e
first break in the ranks, and as it rani hack to the
preferences of a constituency Mr. Driggi cannot be
addressed as a traitor nor read out of the camp -.c
a bolter, for his people agree with him. It cannot be
paid that he is the forerunner of a change in the party
policy. It is only an indication of the beginning of
other divisions in the party in addition to the great
schism of 1896. His attitude is such an evidence of
the failure of a policy as to humiliate the majority of
his party leaders, and they have no course except to
drown his voice by a clamor for the platform, policy
and candidate of 1896.
THE FOREMOST OMERICON.
ONi: HUNDRED years ago to-day Washington
died. In hi* lifetime he had not escaped criti
e;-m an.l attack. From the beginning of our
constitutional period, which he inaugurated as the
tir-t rrciidcnt. the signs of party division appeared,
and before the dose of his life the rival views of con
stitutional interpretation held by JefTerson and Hamil
ton had already founded the two great schools in
American politics. Washington understood with
great clearness the dividing line between principle and
expediency, Because some of his cotetnporaries did
not dearly make that distinction he was misrepre
sented. This i^uc aro^c with the necessity of abro
gating our treaty with France, which practically
dosed our ports to any but French commerce. That
convention was made in the stress and crisis of the
Revolution. Rut after that struggle was over and we
were in the calm of peace it became evident that re
li.inrc solely Bpotl French commercial contacts Wli a
crave mistake, which would seriously impair the for
tunes and clok the progress of the young republic.
It being apparent that our natural and our greatest
commerce must \n- with Rutland, and that upon ex
ternal trade must be our first dependence for national
advancement, the highest consideration of expediency
requirel a commcrci.il treaty with Great Rritnin. B)
the treaty with France in 1778 it was agreed that we
should not conclude any treaty with another power
without the consent of France. When the necessity
of commercial intercourse with Great Britain became
: parent as to be irresistible we entered into the
commercial convention of 1704 against the. wish and
:t the consent of France. This caused a violent
outbreak of party feeling. Rut the lapse of time has
demonstrated Washington's wisdom, for the treaty of
the effective commercial emancipation of this
country and the final assertion of our independence of
tin- Mi7cr;iimy of France and all other power?. The
partisan* of JefTerson furnished most of the critics,
but the commercial independence secured by Wash
ington was eagerly taken advantage of by Jefferson's
disciples in the embargo incident to the war of 1812.
Rut notwithstanding this beginning of partisan
clamor which somewhat clouded the close of Wash
ington'a life, at his death, five year* after the cause of
attacks upon him. the whole nation stood awe-stricken
and impressed with the belief that the foremost man
in all the world had fallen.
The vivid dtanget and rapid movement of progress
in the century gone since that day have not effaced
nor changed that impression. The history of man
kind, the experience of the world in the change of
governments, the rise and fall of dynasties, and even
in the emergence of peoples into a larger liberty, has
not shifted his place in the esteem of men. In his
farewell address was hi- statement of principle in
exposition of his view of expediency. In that address
his countrymen were given the best definition of their
government. <<t the principles upon which it is
founded and the practices upon which its perpetuity
must depend Laid beside the Declaration of Inde
pendence that address furnishes a complete interpre
â¢ : <>f our constitution, and the two will survive
forever as our reason tor seeking independence and
leH-government and a statement of the national
by which alone they can be made perpetual.
In his patience, wisdom, unselfishness and far for
ward look Washington stands supreme at the head of
the world's worthier. In his mind originated the
Fundamental principles of the constitution, which
were concreted into expression by Madison. That
brief document, on which now rests our colossal
-al structure, could not be made to-day. Com
manding the profound admiration of the world's best
thinkers for a centu-y. if it were swept into oblivion
grow, and the best wisdom of these times
among us were called to the task of substituting it.
the complexities of our modern life would induce a
nr less simple statement of the unchanging principles
upon which rest the rights of man. It reflected the
'â¢city and plainness of Washington's life, and
"tan.'- â  to tl nfidence of his country
men in his stainless integrity and his mighty capacity
resee the institutions of which it was to be the
matrix.
BSidered ns â  man his great virttie was hiÂ« per
fect control. Naturally of quick
and emotional temper, be held this quality in hand
a<- a useful energy and never submitted to it as a
â¢ r. He had to arrest and change history, to un
root tradition, to found new habits >>i thought among
his countrymen There iÂ« evidence that to the mass
of them, even at the close of the Revolution, self
government, the rule of a reasonable majority, were
terms merely, and not comprehended as the rule of
action for a government. If his had been the ordinary
ambition of even great men this country would merely
have escaped the rule of a foreign monarchy to erect
tate and circumstance of in American royalty.
I'm he had wrought and endured, suffered in patience
and borne defeat Without drpre>si.,n and victory witli
\ultation. for quite another purpose than the
raiMiiK of another among the scepters which repre
sented the rule of one over the many. He had in
deed borne all and done all to crown a new kin*?, but
that was not to be a king among the kings â merely
om- more man crowned and enthroned and invested
with authority- but a nation that was to be Icing
among nations, with every man in it a ruler. Around
wis the fulfillment of his perfect irorlc Let u<
â¢st oursehres unduly. Men say sometimes that
Washington was behind the timeÂ«; that he and the
men of his generation never saw a railway, nor tele
praph. nor any of the magic of power and mechanism
which has transformed modern life. That is true.
Rut it is true also that no American of this genera
tion took a naked sword from the Continental Con
gress to fla<l it through the night of seven years'
war for hum. i liberty and the right of man to govern
himself, and at the end gave it back to the Continental
Congress dulled arid nicked and rusted in the task of
carving out a new nation in which all men are ruler-,
equal m right and equal in opportunity. He won for
us that emancipation and enfranchisement which are
the final cause of all we have and are. These thincr*
we boast, unseen as they are by him in the flesh, arc
but the monuments builded to lm memory and per
petuating among men the foremost greatness of his
character and the lasting glory of his name.
MORE POWER FOR THE COM
MISSION.
SENATOR CULLOirS bill designed to amend
the act creating the Interstate Commerce Com
mission by largely extending and augmenting
its powers will renew a contest which has been going
on for a long time, but which ought to be closed at
tins tesctoa of Congress. The object of the bill
is to provide a means of putting an end to those
freight discriminations which seriously disturb busi-
It has been found that under the act as h
stands the commission hai not sufficient power to ac
complish the desired regulation of rates, and the ne
cessity of amending the act has long been apparent.
The problem is that of so regulating rates that rail
- will be able to earn fair dividends upon the
capital invested without having to extort. unjust rates
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. THURSDAY, DECEMBER 14, 1899.
from certain classes of shippers. It is a plain propo
sition that if railways haul goods for certain corpora
tions for hardly more than cost they must make up
their profits by charging other shippers considerably
more than should be done. In other words, when
discrimination is practiced in the commercial world
it results in an injustice that hampers both commerce
and industry, and while one set of shippers pay but
little others have to pay all the traffic will bear.
Railway managers are not altogether to blame for
the extent to which freight discriminations prevail in
the business. Some of them have made earnest efforts
to avoid the necessity of granting discriminations by
arranging pools which would put an end to competi
tion. The pooling system, however, proved worse
than the evil it was designed to cure, and, moreover,
did not cure the evil, for it was soon discovered that
no matter how skillfully the pooling agreements were
drawn up there was always a means by which an en
terprising freight agent could succeed in granting re
bate* or some other form of discrimination to big
shippers. Thus it was noted that one of the railway
companies of New York, finding no way by which it
could arrange a rebate of freight rates to the Standard
Oil Company, made things agreeable to the company
by arranging to purchase a certain quantity of oil
even* year at a price so much in excess of the market
rate as would return to the oil men the amount of
the freight reduction agreed upon.
The Cullom bill gives the commission power to
fix both a maximum and minimum rate or differential
in rates when necessary to prevent discrimination; to
make changes in classification and to amend the rules
and regulations under which traffic is moved, and
makes the order of the commission effective within
the time specified, which ordinarily shall be not less
' than thirty days. Any carrier may within thirty days
begin proceedings in the United States Circuit Court
for a review of the order. Either party may appeal
directly to the Supreme Court, and the case is to have
precedence in the courts. The bill also further pro
vides that the commission shall make and establish
a uniform classification. The long and short haul
clause is made an absolute prohibition except upon
leave granted by the commission. Large penalties are
provided again Â«t carriers in case of departure from
the published rate.
The new bill is not dissimilar tn others which have
! befti baffled by the opposition in Congress and will of
course meet with strong opposition. Sooner or later.
however, some such measure will have to be enacted,
for the evils of freight discrimination are becoming
intolerable, and the sooner it is done the better.
NO better souvenir in the way of a Christmas re
membrance will be offered to Californians for
sending to their friends than the Christmas edi
tion of The Call which will appear on Sunday. The
number will be as artistic from a pictorial point of
view as any calendar or holiday card of the season,
and in addition to its news features will have the in
terest of a magazine of Christmas stories, poems and
sketches.
The salient attraction of the number will be the
lamlsomely illustrated cover?, each of which will pre
sent a picture appropriate to the season and de
signed especially for this issue of The Call. The at
tention of artistic critics can be safely directed to the
themes of these pictures and to the skill with which
they have been worked out by the artists and repro
duced by lithography. Nothing better has ever been
produced by a newspaper, and in this respect the
Christmas edition of The Call will mark the highest
level reached by a daily journal in the production of
genuine fine art.
While the number will be attractive to readers in
all parts of the world by reason of the beauty of its
illustrations and the charm of its literary features the
people of San Francisco and of California general!/
will find it of particular interest and value at this sea
son because of the thorough manner in which it will
set forth bargains in all lines of holiday novelties and
Christinas goods. Persons who find it difficult to de
cide what to choose for their friends will derive plenty
of ideas on the subject from the teeming advertising
columns of this splendid holiday number. In fact.
the only embarrassment that will be felt after RomÂ«
over the rich array of gifts and -ouvenirs of all kin's
noted in the number will be that of determining which
to choose where such a variety of excellence is of
fered.
The Call has been earnest at all seasons in urging
the people of California to patronize home Industrie*,
and only a short time ago pointed out the advantage
that would accrue to the State if Californians sent
to their Kastem friends Californian articles as gifts
for the holiday season. A wide distribution of The
Call of Sunday throughout the Eastern States would
also b e helpful in that way. since it would make
known the abounding prosperity of the city and the
State and attractions which are offered here for home
seekers. As we have said, the number will be attrac
tive and interesting from every point of view and will
be welcomed with admiration and delight in every
cultured home.
From the tenor of the discussions at the Horticul
tural Convention at San Jose it is easy to draw the
conclusion that while individual enterprise can plant
an orchard and grow fruit it is going to take a good
deal of co-operation to pre\ent the railway company
from gathering in all the profit on the crop.
"Cupid" Danforth says there's nothin' doin' these
days at the marriage license office. One day this
week there was not a single application for a permit
to take the fatal plunge. No wonder. How can a
man marry a girl and afford to make her a Christ
mas present in the same month?
Up to this time, at any rate, the British have not
committed any aggressions on the territory of the
Boers. In fact, they have not been able to hold their
own frontier, and might claim sympathy on the
ground that their territory is being overrun.
California will not have to stand alone in fighting
Mr. Kasson's reciprocity treaties, for all the wool and
beet sugar producing States arc getting into line with
us and will help in the battle.
The fact that a turkey eaten by members of the
family of a well-known saloon man contained pto
maines will hardly deter any great number of people
from accepting invitations to Christmas dinners.
General Gatacre seems to have suffered at Storm
berg by obeying the time-honored injunction to con
sult the stars when in difficulty. At any rate he told
his troubles to a policeman.
General Buller will not take his Christmas dinner
at Pretoria, as he expected, for the chances are he
will have a previous engagement for the day some
where near Ladysmith.
The proposed park extension extends directly

of

I.I'NAR ECLIPSE.
Till-: unusual spectacle of a crescent
moon above the eastern horizon In
the evening may bo witnessed on
Saturday. December 16, from sunset
until 7 p. m.
The -mum- of the phenomenon 1b entirely
distinct from that which Irrevocably
awards the young moon to the western
nky of evening ami the waning phase to
the eastern nky of morning. naN fa
miliar monthly glimpses are obtained
WhÂ«n the Illuminated side of the <Â»rb Ih
marly iivi-rt- .1 from our view; but the .ijj
proaching phenomenon t;ikÂ«s place when
the disk, brimming with radiance, la
turned directly earthward; in other words,
at full moon.
In the mld.-n of effulgence a deep shadow
falls on Its path and gradually tho lunar
mountains, plains and valley* are de
prived of their glowing sunlight, only a
i-li-minr curve ii'-ar the south pole of the
moon escaping immersion. Tin- deep
shadow is that of the earth, and for more
than three hours its satellite is to a
greater or less extant partially eclipsed.
The Illustration represents a cross-sec
tion of the rone-shaped terrestrial shadow
und the principal phases an the moon
glides through Its southern portion. First
contact with the shadow occurs before
moonrlse. but at dusk. If tht atmosphere
be clear, a strange looking half-moon will
appear north of east In an erect position
with Its curving side by no means facing
sunward, as In the case of the monthly
en -cents, lint In a southerly direction
The mid position of the lunar disk in the
illustration may be seen at 5:26 p. m and
the third phase, indicated by the direction
of the arrow, occur* about an hour
ward, when thr diurnal motion of thÂ»Â»
heavens tuu brought our satellite to a
convenient altitude almost directly east
Those who art familiar with lunar
topography and nomenclature will ti"d
that the shadow advances from the direc
tion of the east limb beyond Arlstarchus
and that last contact Is near the west
limb beyond Mare Crislum. During the
central phase, when more than nine

the dim gray tinted "old nnon" m.ule via

shadowed disk wearing a copper colored
tint, though the dark side of the earth is
of necessity toward It during a lunar
eclipse.
To appreciate the delicate footing of this
unwonted glow It is well to consider that
the earth In a line between sun and moon
though at the time of totality obscuring
all sunlight, retains Its transparent at
mospheric envelope, which is illuminated
by crimson rays on the borderland of day
nnd night. This aureole, which would
radiate into space but for refraction
curves Its luminosity moonward. thus r*-'
lleving the darkness of the lunar land
scapes. On some occasions, however
probably on account of atmospheric
cloudiness in the twilight circle the
eclipsed satellite remains Invisible.
As total lunar eclipses are not frequent
this coming obscuration will receive more
notice than is generally given to th*> par
tial pnase. ROSE O'HALLORAN.

Granted Permit for
Patent Advertising.
VICTIMS CRY "GOLD BRICK"
GRANTEE CITED TO MAZE EX
PLANATION.
Six month! ago the Harbor Commis
sioners granted to Robert McKUUcan the
privilege of erecting two â¢ advertising
I stands In the depot waiting rooms. Yes
i terday afternoon the board was surprised
|by the story of two menâ H. Rattenberry
and S. Solomonsonâ lntroduced by ex-
Governor Budd, who asserted that they
were losers to the extent of $6100 through
the medium of said advertising. privilege.
The recital of their etory caused the
board to take prompt action, and Mr. Me-
KHUcan was cited to appear at the next
meetln* and explain why the privilege
; granted him should not be declared for
feited. as If If now nullified In fact, be
cause It has passed cut of his hands.
Attorney Budd brought the matter up
I and said It was necessary for the board
to act. as one of Its privileges had been
abupfd. Ho Introduced copies of two
transfers, one from McKlllican to J. W.
Fawl â  and another from Fawkes to the
Scenic Display Company. A search of the
records showed that tne original fran
chise was granted to McKlllican on June
27. and that he was to pay $100 rent per
month when the machines were In ope
ration. One month later the privilege was
transferred to other parties.
President Kllburu moved that McKllll
ran btr ordered to appear and enow cause
â¢ why his privilege should not be revoked.
I 1 his motion was debated warmly. Major
Harncy Faying that to order McKlllican
I to appear upon the facts as presented by
I the two alleged vlrtimu would create an
Impression very unfair to McKillican.
Attorney Budd said that the grievance
of tho victims was not against McKilli
can. who is an honest man and parted
, with his privilege in good faith, but
against a corporation. On this under
: standing a citation for McKilllcan was
Issued, as he is the only party with whom
the board can deal.
Hattenberry told the board that no ma
chines had been built, and that they could
not learn that any were in course of con
struction. It had been represented to
thorn that the profits from the privilege
would be over $30,000 a year, and they
were Induced to enter a corporation capi
talize.! for $100,000. of whom C. E. Snook.
L S. Church. Mr. and Mrs. Fawkes. Rat
tenberry and Solomonson were directors.
Solomonson said he had lost $4600, al
though he had only put $1500 into the con
cern. Th* men stated that they had r<Â»
celved about one-third of their money
back, and that they came before the
board to let it know how it was being
' mocked, and to prevent other 3 from fol
lowing their woeful example.
Major Harney explained that the ap
plication for the privilege had contained
the words "McKlllican and associates."
and that the minutes showed It had been
granted solely to McKlllican, and that
having been transferred without permls-
I slon it Is now of no effect. All the mem
: bers of the- board expressed astonishment
that a matter apparently so trivial had
grown Into an affair of such magnitude.
Secretary Dennlson. representing the
City Street Improvement Company, asked
for an explanation concerning work on
slip No. 7. His firm has a contract for
certain work, and 6ince It was commenced
changes had been made in the original
plan, necessitating the letting of another
contract to the Dur.don Company. The
Dundon contract cannot be commenced
till the oriplnal work Is completed, an.l
Secretary Dennlson thought there might
be a conflict of Interests. It was decided i
to leave the matter to the two contrac- i
tors and the harbor eifglneer to reach an
amicable settlement.
The board ordered the following bills
paid: City Street Improvement Company, 1
work at Bryant street. W. 554; San Fran
cisco Timber Preserving Company, JSIS6.
WILL RETAIN PRESENT FORCE.
Auditor W*!ls yesterday announced that
I he would make no changes In his clerical
i force during his new term of office com
mencing January 8. 1900. The new charter
allows him one chief deputy at J2OO a
month, two clerks at $!25 each and two at
$100 each. The Incumbents of these posi
tions will be retained, though their re
spective salaries are reduced from J2T>\
$150 and $125 by the terms of the- new or-
J granic law of the city. Besides these five
I statutory employes there are two extra
clerks n-jw steadily employed on the as
sessment rolls, which are provided by or
der of the Board of Supervisors.
It Is Ihe opinion of the Auditor that he
will require at least two more clerks to
carry on the additional work Imposed by
the charter on his office. In retlttlnc his
1 present quarters two extra windows nave
Doen constructed, ono of which will be
used by the teachers and other employes
of the city covemment to receive and sign
for ttu-ir salary demands, all of which will
be Issued 1 v the Auditor. Licenses and
fee blanks will also be Riven out at this
window. Another window will be devoted
t- the redemption of property sold for
taxes. Two clerks in constant attendance
will be required for these purposes.
Th" Auditor resrets thai the new char
ter reduces salaries in his office.
"We do a business of $8,000,000 here an
nually," he said yesterday, "and thÂ© head
bookkeeper In any business house down
town which does a business of less than
one-quarter of that amount Is paid over
double what my chief deputy Rets. All
my present force, however, Is anxious to
remain at the reduced salaries and I will
retain It as It now stands."

"IF YOU HANG ME,
YOU WILL HANG
THE HOLY GHOST"
Hunt, the Murderer,
Proves Insane.
HE TALKS WILDLY IN COURT
A JURY PASSES JUDGMENT AS
TO HIS CONDITION.
"I am willing to bang for my crime."
said Robert L. Hunt, the insane murderer
j of George R. Elliott and E. R. Knlppen
berg, as he gently stroked -what looked
| like a paint brush fastened to his chin
on the stand In Judge Lawlor's court yes
terday, 'but I want It understood that on
the gallows I will tell them that they are
hanging the Holy Ghost."
Hunt was taken before Judge Lawlor
and a Jury was sworn In to determine hU
sanity In order that It might be deter
mined whether or not he should be placed
on trial for the murder of his victims.
Hunt Immediately took the stand and la
two minutes he thoroughly demonstrated
the fact that he is a dangerous lunatic.
"Ot course 1 shot Elliott," he said, "but
Kmppenberg and I were both Innocent
parti' s. I shot him because he married
the woman whose *oul was in me.
, Ofttlmea 1 receive Jesus Christ. I get a
1 touch of him in the hand where he was
cruclrled, but it gots away In a few
hours. I usually feel spirited when I re
ceive the Holy Ghost. Elliott baw good
cra'-e In me and married the woman
whoso koul is in me. but I had her soul.
I am not crazy. If I am God Almighty is
crazy, und God isn't crazy. I am glad I
killed Elliott. He deserved killing. I
laid for him and then I walked around
and then into the Young America Ealoon
Â«.n Howard street and pulled out my pis
tol and shot him. The bullet went through
his hf-art nnd then killed Knippenberg.

PROPOSED TELEPHONE ORDEBS.
The License Committee of the Board of
Supervisors met yesterday morning to
consider the proposed orders for taxing

a penalty for defective service. Secretary
K. W. Eaton of the Pacific Telephone and
Telegraph Company addressed the com
mittee and Ptatt-d that after consultation
with Attorney E. S. Plllsbury and others
ho had concluded that the ordinances
wer<Â» illeKal and that the proposed taxa
tion was unjust anct excessive. He claim
ed that the. company had paid on $3w.(A)O
additional assessment by Assessor Dodge
and asked the committee to be consider
ate. The company had dune all in Its
power to oorrect errors and defects In the
service and had been put to the necessity
of discharging numerous girl operators on
account of their Inefficiency.
When Katun had concluded his plea
Supervisor AlÃHtlnser moved that the
committee recommend the passage of the
order by the. board. The motion was not
s- i-onded. and on Supervisor IMack's mo
tion, seconded l>y Chairman Lackmann.
the proponed orders were referred to the
City and County Attorney with a request
that he report his opinion on their legal
ity, upon which tile full board will tuke
action at the meeting next Monday. Su

procedure, hut wns overruled.

Diseased Chickens Condemned.
Chief Market Inspector Witzemann yes
terday afternoon condemned 102 chickens
and four turkeys In a carload which came
from Omaha, Nebr. The fowl were In a
diseased condition and were sent to the
fertilizing works. Similar action was
taken with sixteen of the chickens that
were tr;implcd to death. The carload was
consigned to EL Il'-rkmann of 400 Davis
Htreet. The dead chickens were being put
In a pack to be sent to the store when
Wltzemann appeared upon the scene.
Inspector Witzomann has expressed his
lntr-ntlon of condemning all turkeys or
chickens whose throats are not silt In the
markets preparatory to dressing them for
Bale. Borne dealers, he says, arc In the
habit of dashing tho turkey's head against
the wall, thus breaklnK Its neck. The law
compels "Wltn^mann to condemn a cow
which breaks its neck, and he proposes to
act similarly in the case of fowl.

Thera was an exodus of warships, mail

! round about 4 p.m. five of the largest ves
i sels that come to the port were off the
I Farallonea making their courses. At 2:16
p. m. the battleship lowa and the cruiser
Philadelphia, passed Melggs wharf at half
speed. At 2:33 p. m. the Mail steamer
Australia followed In their wake and ten
minutes later the Coptic put In an appear
ance. At 3:10 p. m. the transport Vic
toria passed along and was within hailing
distance of the rest of the fleet when they
were discharging their pilots.
The lowa and Philadelphia are bound
for San Diego, where they will be Joined
by the cruiser Marblehead. All three yes-
I sels will then go for a cruise along the
coast of Lower California and from thoie

Honolulu. The Australia goes to that port
alone, but with the Coptic the Island cap
ital Is only a port of call. From there the

ports and thence to Hongkong. There
was some talk of a race between the two
steamers, but the Australia Is In no trim
for making speed and no attempt will be

1 The pleasant method and beneficial
effects of the well known remedy.
Syrup, of Figs, manufactured by the
California Fio.Svrup Co., illustrate
the value of obtaining the liquid laxa-
tive principles of plants known to be
medicinally laxative and presenting
them in the form most refreshing to the
taste and acceptable to the system. It
is the one perfect strengthening laxa-
tive, cleansing the system effectually,
dispel] colds, headaches and fevers
gently yet promptly and enabling one
to overcome habitual constipation per-
manently. Its perfect freedom from
every objectionable quality and sub-
stance, and its acting on the kidneys,
liver and bowels, without weakening
or irritating them, make it the ideal
laxative.
In the process of manufacturing figs
are used, as they are pleasant to the
taste, but the medicinal qualities of the
remedy are obtained from senna and
other aromatic plants, by a method
known to the California Fig Syrup
Co. only. In order to get its beneficial

three games, winning one; the locals play
ed two (tamcc, loataaj both. On Saturday
and Sunday Oakland will be given a
chance to show Its mettle when pitted
inraJnct the returned CallfornUtns.
All the pames have been fairly well
played, and one in particular, the Sun
day match between Sacramento and the
Ali-CaHfornlans, was the very best ex
hibition of ball seen on a local diamond
for some years. As the teams stand at
I present, Oakland is a stronger nine than
I San Francisco. In the games Saturday
I afternoon and Sunday Oakland will have
I Its best men. Horchers pitching Saturday
and Steffani Sunday.
Men are being signed or pledged by the
managers for next season. Cul lOwing
announces that he will start the season
with about the same team he has at pres
ent. This will give Oakland a great chance
at the beginning: of the series, for the nine
as now organized Is strong and equal to

nmong the horsemen now racing strings here. On the first day of January three yearlings will
graduate to the two-veir-old division, for which the various racing associations offer valuable purses.

HEAVY- WEIGHT SOUBRETTE LOSES
A BATTLE ON THE BARBARY COAST
THE witness stand in Police Judge Mogan's court
nearly collapsed on Monday when Miss Louise
Marshall planted upon it her ample personality,
preparatory to telling his Honor how the war
broke out on th* Barbary Coast. Her 300 odd
pounds of flesh were concealed In the folds of a double
decked mackintosh and her right eye was In mourning
for the liattle ahe had â â .-t.
At the time of the commencement of hostilities Miss
Marshall was a soubrette In the heavy-weight division at
the Eureka Music Hall on Kearny street. She lured sol
dier boys to the boxes with simps of home and mother
und. once there, found It easy, with her extraordinary
avoirdupois, to flatten their pocket-books. Not another
poubretto or song-and-dance lady or Ingenue could hold
a candle to her. Her head began to take on embonpoint
and her nose assumed Fuch a tilt that It could be Induced
only to the normal level In a champagne glass.

Among the passengers on the ZoÂ«alandla

Otis. He is now at the Occidental Hotel.
awaiting orders from the War Depart
ment.
Major Met lure went out to Manila with
General Merrltt. and since his arrival
there he has handled over eleven millions
of dollars in Govcinrrent money, wnich
means double that tmoui.t In the coin of
the it-tanas.
The premium on American gold is ex- {
actly II 00. but it v.. ? not always so h'.gh, j
and" the attempts of the paymasters to
keep up the premium occupied a good part !
of their time while In Manila.
According to Major Mcdure, American
gold was always eagerly accepted by the
Manila Lanka and by the tradesmen, but ;
they were 6omc-what shy of the American :
silver money. At flm they would rot pay |
the premium, and It was only when It w*a
proved to th?m that tbe value of the sli
ver dollar lay not in the metal of which
it vras madÂ« but In the Btamp it bore that
they would take It at the tamo rate as
gold.
The banks in the Islands and in Hong- j
kong are all run on a silver basis, and
that, too, caused endless trouble. The
banks wculd accept gold from the offi- |
cers and men. but they would accept it on
a silver basis, and when it came to draw- ,
ing money out. if the depositors wished
to have grid they had to pay from 6 to 8
pÂ«-r cent premium for It One of thÂ« cap
tains brought his company fund of %24W
to the Hongkong Bank ii. Manila and was
credited with a deposit of $4!Â«W In inland
money. Next day he wished to draw
bome'out and it was offered to him in
silver. He refused to accept the silver
on the ground that his deposit had been
In gold, but he was told that made no dif
ference; if he wanted gold he would have
to pay 8 per cent premium for it. Then
he demanded his deposit back Just as he
had put It in. but he was refused. Ihoy
I had his gold all right, but he would have
to pay high for it if be wantod to get it
1 out The captain appealed to Major Mc-
Clure and he sent for the provost mar
i shal. Together they reasoned with the
bank officials and finally the captain .got
his money back in gold, less $5 the bank
kept for Itself, for what reason no one
could understand. -Â..,.
It was *o with every deposit. A deter
mined eOort was made to have it so the
1 officers and men of the army could de
posit their gold in the banks and draw 'it
out again, but the banks would not agree
to any such arrangement- They were
working on a silver basis, they said, and
any one who wanted gold would have to
P Vhis Or state of affairs led to the estab
lishment of a safe deposit by the paymas
ters' department. A strong room was
built In the city of Manila, and any offi
cer or man who wished could leave his
mnnev and his valuables there. At one
time there were nearly 1000 depositors.
Kach man's money or valuables were tied
up in a little canvas bag, and whenever
he dr<Â»w any out he had Ui make a note
of the fact on a tag attached to the bag.
There was a clerk to keen track of the
bags but no books could be kept. so each
man had to keep his own. It worked Just
as well as a bank and was much less ex
' pensive.
As a matter of fact whenever the banks
I got hold of any of the army gold It was
1 shipped out of the country at once. Major
Mcclure made a deposit of nearly $200,000
on one occasion, and when he went back
after It a few days later $20,000 had been
sent to Hongkong and $150,000 had been
sent to London. He drew out the remain

without paying the premium, however,
and after that there was not much trou

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 14, 1899.
Jarred severely on the remainder of the female talent, on
none rryire than Josie Dupree. daughter of the proprie
tor. Fortified by the relationship to the house, Miss Du
pree, even If ehe 1b In the feather-weight class, had nerve
enough to remark time nnd again that Miss Marshall
was a female Jumbo and "gave her a pain."
Even a 300-pound soubrette could not stand thatâ no, not
from the proprietor himself, and Miss Marshall sought an
explanation. She got It direct a few nights before
Thanksgiving, when Miss Dupree soaked her in the right
eye with a heavy beer glass, putting her to sleep and can
celing her engagement at the house. The Injured sou
brette swore nut a warrant for the arrest of her assailant.
Judge Mogan heard most of the testimony on Mon
day before putting the case over till to-day. He is
Inclined to the belief, In the face of the fact that Miss
Marshall weighs 3<X) pounds and Miss Dupree only 115,
that the preponderance of evidence Is with the prosecu
tion.
because there need be no advice from the
sub-treasuries a* to whether or not there
Is mom y to pay the drafts. In the or
tlinary oourse of events. If a draft be
pn-sentod to a bank In Manila, as is the
case anywhere else, the llrst thing the
bank must do 1b to ascertain If the man
firesentlup the draft has money to pay It
n the lank upon which the draft is
drawn. It costs money to telegraph from
Manila, however, so It becomes an ex
pensive operation. But in the case of a
draft on the United States treasury no
such advice rh that need be sought, 80
wh'ii Major McClure wanted any cold
Dki in Manila were more than anx
l< in t" accept his draft on the treasury.
He found, however, that the banks werÂ«
hot paying the full premium on American
nnd he determined to use this
privilege of exchange upon the United
States to force the premium up. The
banks were paying 12 03. He demanded
that they ray the m>>n $2 M; If they did
not ho declared he would take no more
gold frrm them. They agreed, but on go
ing Into one of the. banks one day to see
h<>w the agreement was being carried out
ho found them paying only $2 05. The
banks were at once notified that It wan all
off between them and the United States.
an<l the result was another agreement,
thin time an effective one. by which the
banks paid the highest premium. At one
time it was even as high a* $2 06. but It
â  ill n^t remain at that. Major MrClure
ncure.! that by not having to telegraph
for advice and by using the drafts as ex
change, then by not having to have the
gold the drafts represented sent out to
them with a delay of perhaps three
months, the banks saved enough to more
than pay them without having to shave
the premium on the soldiers' pay.
The banking buslnes* with the soldiers
was materially decreased by a permis
sion Major McClure secured before he left
for the islands. Forseeing that a great
many of the men would send hums much
of their pay. he secured permission to pay
such men as would accept them. In
checks. It Is forbidden by the regulations
to pay In anything but gold coin, but the
permission tv pay In checks was granted.
In that way the paymaster's department
r four million dollars, which
waÂ« paid in checks, leaving the gold they
represented to be used In other ways. It
wiu- no uncommon thing for a captain to
come to the paymaster with a list of men
all living in the same town and drawing
their pay In a lump sum. This ' cheok
would be mailed to some bank In the town
with a list of the amounts aad to whom
they should be paid; and all It cost was
the postage ana one-quarter of one per
cent for Insurance. Thousands of dollars
were sent home In this way.
There was another interesting experi
ence with the Introduction of United
States paper into the financial system Of
the islands. At first gold notes were not
welcome, but soon they went through the
same course as had the silver dollars. As
soon as It became known that their re
demption value wan fully aa good as gold
and It was realized they could be shipped
not by freight but by mail, there was a
rush for them, and the banks gathered
them in. It was the Intention to put them
in circulation In the Islands and by letting
them mingle with the currency of tho
country gradually to bring the financial
syst.-m round to what It Is In this country
: and have business transacted with the
American standard as the basis. With
I this object In view $500,000 In gold notes
were sent out as a venture. The Eastern
soldiers, being used to paper money, were
! glad to get them Then the banks, find
ing they were Just the thing for ship
i ments of coin, went after them and before
lonp the |500. "00 in gold notes had disap
| peared. The greater part of It had bÂ»en
sent out of the country. 81nce then there
have been other amounts floated at dlf
f* rent times and now they have secured
1 a foothold.
"There Is perhapn not mw than $1,100,
000 In native money in circulation In the
1 Islands." paid Major McClure yesterday.
, In describing the financial Bystem of the
I new possessions. "Most of It Is debased
silver coined In Spain and sent out to tne
lslandp There Is Borne native mon>-v,
coined in Manila, and the Filipino Espan
ola Bank had the right to Issue notes.
Resides, there Is the MÂ«-xi'-an money.
B very thing down there Is on a silver ba
' sis, and It 1? hard for nny one used to
I the customs of the United States to
I understand the way they do business.
There is no such thing as a small per cent
I down there. What In the I'nltea Rtntos
â  would be half a per cent or at most one
per cent. In the Islands is two and a half,
! five or eight per cent. Gold is at a pre
i mlum of from six to sight per cent, but It
'Is not kept In the country- It is shipped
I out to England as soon as It is taken in.
Of our own money there is now In circu
lation over $3,000,000 in specie and papÂ».r.
I The banks are all paying the full pre
mium and the natives are becoming used
to it.
"The question of places for deposit for
tho soldiers was a vexing one at first, hut
Is was settled by the. payments in checks
I and by tho establishment of the snf* de
j posit. I wns In the army of the Potomac
1 and I remember the way the paymasters
would come to the men and pay them
and then what trouble the men "had to
take care of their money and get It home
if they wlshrd to send It there; and I de
termined then that If ever I reached a
position where I could arrange a bet'er
system I would do bo. As It Is now, the
men In the Philippines can send tholr
money home without trouble to them
selves and fur the cost of a stamp; they
can pay hills in the same way and they
can deposit their money in such a man
ner that they can get at It whenever they
wish. Many of them deposit their money
with the. paymaster, as Is allowed by the
regulations, but they cannot draw it
again until they have been mustered out.
It. therefore. Is necessary that they hayÂ«
money where they can draw upon It, and
this has been arranged for them."
Major MrClure believes the war will be
over within twn months. It may be over,
he sayÃ, before the last of the "troops on
their way to the islands can get there.
The Insurgents, according to him, are a
band of brigands, hated by the people of
the country, wh. are trying to keep *hÂ«
war going until McKlnley has been driv.-n
from office, for they believe a revolution
Is Imminent In this country, with the re
moval of the President for Its object.
Two months more, he is sure, will
settle It

his death Dr. Carbon's sudden Hint--*
was not expected to terminate fatally.
Despite the complication of serious
maladies from which he was a suf
ferer his physicians were confident
that his splendid constitution and the
exemplary '"â¦* he had lived would as
sure his recovery. It was not un il
the lant hour, when he began to
weaken rapidly, that his serfous condi
tion was realised, but it was then too
late to do more than relieve his im
mediate sufferings.
Dr. Carson was taken ill on Monday
night while attending a banquet
given by Golden Gate Commandeiy.
Knights Templar. His affection was
one of ihe heart, from which he ha<l
suffered for some years, but from
which he had never before been sen
ously 111. His death Is unusually sa*l,
in that It came upon him in the mid
dle of his honeymoon, he having been
married but two months ago.
Deceased was a native of Morristown. Term.. nnrt .".1 years of age. HÂ« re

STRAW BONDSMEN
PARALYZED OVER
JURY'S VERDICT
Kelly Confident of
Acquittal.
AN APPEAL WILL BE TAKEN
GANG TO KEEP UNDER COVER
IN THE MEANTIME.
Thomas A. Kelly's conviction for having
knowingly and feloniously, accepted a
"straw bond" for the rel< toe of v thiev
ing negro has fallen Ilka a bomb among
the crooked element that haunts the City
Hall for the purpose of perpetrating simi
lar scandals on the people. They are fly-
Ing to cover in bunches and In the mean
time Kelly la â peculating as to whether
or not he will be given a new trial by the
Supreme Court or whether or not Judge
l-awlor will make an example of him and
give him the full limit allowed by law
lor his crime.
Ex-Judge Dibble, who defended Kelly,
and Kelly himself are confident that re
versible error exists In the record of the
case and that the accused will ultimately
be acquitted. An appeal will be taken
Immediately to the Supreme Court. On
the other hand the prosecution is contl
dent that the conviction will stand and
that the punishment of Kelly will stand
as an example for the rest of his kind.
Although a great deal of credit belongs
to Captain Seymour for his labor In col
lecting evidence against the "straw"
bondsman, more belongs to Judge Lawlor.
Some time ago an attempt was made to
quash the case on the ground that Hellly.
whose name appeared on the band and
who was an Important witness, could not
be found. Judge I>awlor, however, spur
red the police and District Attorney on to
renewed action and the result was that
Rellly was found and Kelly convicted.
The conviction of Kelly has resulted in a
general grill for Judge Lawlor by the
"gang," but thfÂ» Jurist still stands ready
to rule In the same unbiased and fearless
manner, n the event of the arrest of an
other crook of the same stamp, that in a
great measure resulted In the triumph of
Justice In the case just disposed of.
ROBBED OF HIS
VALUABLES BY A
CONFIDENCE MAN
A Victim of Misplaced
Trust.
Until yesterday morning Frederick
: Denges, 1050 Folsom street, had Implicit
trust In the honesty of his fellow-men,
but now he has good and sufficient cause
to change his mind, and he declares that
it will be a long time before he is played
for a "sucker" again.
On Tuesday Bight he was wandering
around the "tenderloin" in search of
amusement, and at Taylor and Ellis
streets i â¢â¢ was accosted by â  man who
asked to be directed to Kearny street.
They started a conversation, and the
Stranger told Dense* that he had only
arrived In the city from the north that
â  morning and was temporarily in financial
difficulties. He talked so glibly that
Denges became deeply Interested in htm
I and Invited him to have a drink. They
had several drinks, and the stranger sug
gested they should call In two of the fair
! sex to Join In their hilarity. The sugges
i tion was acted upon and they had more
! drinks.
After they parted from the girls Denges
Invited the stranger to accompany him
j to his home, and the stranger appeared to
hesitate; but Denges was Insistent and
they made their way to 1050 Folsom street.
. They slept in the same room, and before
retiring Denges took a purse out of his
pocket and placed it on a shelf in the
closet. It contained $102 in coin and three
' diamond ring* valued at about $.*Â«Â«>
When Denges awoke yesterday morning
! his friend had gone, and when he looked
In the closet the purse and Its contents
had also disappeared. He had a faint
recollection that his new-found friend had
. said that his name was Wickler. but he
! could not recollect his Christian name.
Denges hurried to police headquarters and
told of his loss. He was Instructed to
; procure a warrant for the thief's arrest on
1 the charge of grand larceny, bo he ex
plained his trouble to Judge Mogan. and
I the Judge signed the warrant, and the
detectives are now scouring the city for
! "John Doe" Wickler.
The police believe that Wickler Is a con
\ fidence man. and as Denges was able to
give a good description of him they ex
pect to have him behind the bars soon,
unless he has left the. city, which is not at
1 all Improbable under the circumstances.
ANOTHER TRANSFER CASE.
Henry Lefcovitz Arrested for Dis-
turbing the Peace.
Henry Lefcovitz. a newsboy, was arrest
ed last night on the corner of Market r.nd
Powell streets for selling a transfer. The
person who furnished Information is M.
J. Peeples. Judge Tr^adwell released
young Lefcovltz on bonds.
Peoples some two months ago was ar
rested on a charge of disturbing tho
peace. It was on** of his fads to catch
small boys and take the transfers from
thorn. This brought him Into trouble, and
now he Is (ceding his revenge by Inform
ing on the small transfer sellers.
Pecplfs travels under a sobriquet and his
real namÂ« is supposed to be John Horn.
After the arrest a crowd of newsboys
gathered, chased Horn Into the Emporium
and then out again Into the street. Several
thousand people gathered, shouting '!Â«â 
risively at Horn as a Southern Pacific
"spotter." Mayor Phelan appeared on the
scene and was cheered by the crowd when
he expressed words of sympathy for the
newsboy. ;

BY I>R WILLIAM J R'M.KK
"As You I.ik â¢ It" *;.-â  first prints!, so
far as we know. in the Polio of 1625, but
It was probably written In IW It was en
tered for publication In the Registers of
the Stationers' company on the Itn of
August. MM, with Shakespeare's "Much
Ado" and "Henry V and Den Jonson's
"Every Man in Ills Humor The year
Is not appended to the "i August I' in thÂ«Â»
Register, but it Is fixed beyond â  doubt
by other evidence. All four plays were
marked "to be staled"â that is, their pub
lication was temporarily prohibited. The
prim of "Much Ado" and "Henry V"
MIrS JULIA NELSJN AS ROSALIND
was authorized tx-fore th* end of Auk :<Â«t.
and quarto editions of both m
but for some reason "As* You Like It ' uas
not brought out at that time.
The Sources of the Plot.
In this play Shakespeare dramatized a
popular novel (unless, as Home think, he
made use of an earlier play, now lost,
which was bâ d upon the novel), publish
ed In IfH under the title of "Rosalynde.
Euphucs Golden Legacies," by Thomas
Lodge. The book was reprinted in 1592
and at least eight editions appeared be
fore 1643.
Shakespeare followed the novel so close
ly In Its main incidents that an outline of
Lodge's story may serve very well as a
sketch of the plot of the drama. Lodgo
took the preliminary part of the story
from "The Coke's (Cook's) Tale of Game
lyn," which is found In a few of the later
manuscripts of the "Canterbury Tales."
but It is not regarded by the best critics
as the work of Chaucer.
OamÂ»lyn < Rosader In Lodge) has an
elder brother, who. to get rid of him. ln
hlm to enter a content with a noted
wrestler. Gamelyn In Urn virt.ir In the
match, and to revenge himself upon his
brother attacks his house with an armed
band. After a struggle he is taken pris
oner, but 1b released by an old servant,
Adfatn Spenser, with whom he takes Might
to the forest. This much of the four
teenth century tale Lodge adopts with
trilling changes, Rosader < Gamely nj and
his bad brother Saladyn correspond, of
course, to Orlando and Oliver In the play.
Shakespeare's exiled duke Is represented
by a banished King Gerlsmond, wh De
throne has been usurped by Torlamomi.
Rosader contends with the King's wrest
ler, kills him and gains the love of Rosa
lynde (daughter of the depu-v-d monarch >.
whom Torlsmond noon banishes from
court. His daughter Allnda (Celiai tak-n
her part, whereupon her angry father
banishes her also- ThÂ« two fly (KoÂ«alynde
in male disguise) and betake themaelves
to the forest of Arden, whither Rosader
has gone. Like Shakespeare's girls, they
adopt the names of Ganlmede and Allena.
In the forest they light upon an old shep
herd. Corldon (Cortn) and a young swain.
Montanus tSllvlus). who is In love with
the disdainful Phebe. The fugitives buy
a sheep farm of the landlord of Corldon.
uh" Is employed by them to take care
of It.
Rosader and Adam, after wandering In
the forest, become desperate with nun
ger und the former leaves his aXe 1 r. r
Â« hi!" he goes in search of food. H
comes upon CJerlsmond and his company
at their woodland feast, Is welcomed and
goes back to fetch Adam, who is received
with the same cordiality.
Later Rosader falls in with (Janlme l
and Allena, tolls them the story of hi*
love and Is Ml to play at the gam. of
wooing with the supposed youth, the Oi
lando la the play. Alicna proposes the
"Jesting match that after proved to boa
marriage in earnest."
Meanwhile Haladyn. who has been ban
ished by Torlsmond, comes to the forest
and is on the point of being killed while
asleep by a lion, but is rescued by KoÂ»a
der. A band of robbers attempts to carry
off Allena, and Rosadei', who comes to her
aid, Is nearly overpowered, when Saladyn
appears and the robbers are put to fllg'.t.
This Incident, which Shakespeare on,!'-.
makes the sudden love of Saladyn and
Aliena seem more natural.
Ph<be falls In love with Oanlmede and
sends him a Utter by Montanus. Uant
mede finally promises that he will marry
no woman but her. on condition that If
she pefttMS him she will wed Montana*
The novel ends by Rosalynde's throwing
off her disguise and the three pairs of 'ov
ers arc duly made happy, their marriage
being "solemnly solemnized."
Shakespeare adds thÂ»> characters of
Touchstone, Jaqurs, William and Audrey.
He also makes the banished Duke the
brother of the Emperor, but In the novel
there Is no hint of relationship between
Garismond and T.orlsmond.
(This brief outline Rives no idea of Shakes
peare's indebtedness to Lodge for many minor
details of the action and the dlaloru*. ThÂ«
reader who wishes to trace out these will find
the novel In "fchskesr*-are*s Library" (Mas-
Utt's edition, part I. vol 11) anil somewhat con
densed In Furness' "New Variorum" edition
of the play and In the introduction to the
notes of Rolfe's edition.)
The Stage History of the Play.
Strange as It may seem, the play seems
not to have been a favorite with the fie
ater-golng folk of Shakespeare's <liy.
There is no record whatever of any per
formance during the seventeenth century.
The play was written for the stage and,
of course, was put upon the stage, but
the only evidence of the fact, If evidence
it can be called. Is the tradition that the
part of Adam was taken by the dramatist
himself. Oldys, who died In 1761, was col
lecting materials for a life of Shakespeare.
In his manuscripts we find the statement
that one of Shakespeare's younger
brothers, who lived to a good old age.
used to tell of his visit* to London ami nt
gotng to sec his brother WIJI play. lie
said that he recollected his appearing In
one character as a decrepit o!d man Â«mo
â¢roa so ,vÂ»ak that hÂ«- had t<> be "supported
nn<' carried by ftnotbCT person to a tab>,
ut which be wÂ»s seated nm^ns some com*
pony who were mtlng. and one of t.i-m
Kiing v song."
This seems like a penii!ne remlnlÂ«cencÂ«
of the seventh Â»cene of act 11. If It had
be^n an Invention, the author would nÂ«t
uriiiy have mentioned the name, of the
play, or would have plven further details
of the scene.
There waa also a story told in Stratford
that a venerable citizen of th.it town re
membered seeing Shakespeare oneÂ©
brought upon the statrc on another man's
back. The story could be traced through
Kood authorities to the very days of thÂ«
poet, and is not Improbable on the face of
It. It is In keeping with th.- tradition that
Shakespeare actetl the Ohost In "H.tmlet."
From the few contemporary reference* to
his acting that have come down to m wÂ»
may Infer that, though ho was perhaps
good In these minor parts, he certainly
was not a great actor. It may be that ho
would hav<> gained distinction In that pro
fession had not his inspirations as a poet
led him to give himself to the writing of
plays rather than to acting In them.
It was not until 178, so far as theatrical
records give us any Information, that "As
You Like It" was revived, and then it
was only in a wretchedly corrupted formâ
â  piece prepared by a certain Charles
Johnson and called "Love In a Forest."
Many portions of the original piny are
omitted or transferred to other charac
ters. Speeches and scenes, or parts of
scenes, nre Interpolated from "Richard
III." "Much Ado." "Twelfth Night" and
the "Midsummer Night's Dream." ThÂ«
wrestling in act I Is made a knightly com
bat In the lists, and Charles accuses Or
lando of treason. The characters of
Touchstone, Audrey, William, Corln. 811
vius and Phebe are omitted, Jaques makes
love to Olla and mail lee her In the end.
etc. This vile patchwork and perversion,
however, had â  run of only six nights.
In 1740 the original play was reinstated
on the boards nnd was performed for
twenty-four nights, a good run for that
day. It was performed again In Th and
In 1717. when Peg WofTington played Rosa
lind, with Kitty CUve as Cella and Mack-
Hn as Touchstone. II was while acting
In this play that Peg Wofflnjcton was
struck down by paralysis.
Other revivals of the play occurred In
17C7. 1771. 1775. 1779. 17*>3 and 17X3. At this
last named reproduction Mrs. Slddons es
sayed the part of Rosalind. The opinion*

of the time concerning her success wÂ»r*

mon objection to her -hat It was
crly th.- smile of trnÂ«>-.|>. made the ex

seems to me a misapprehension of thÂ«
character. Rosalind Is class.

but the genial critic none th- psh rocog.
nlres the brilliancy of her wit, her "saucy
playfulness." and her "vivacity," char
acterised by "sensibility" and "sweet
ness" rather than by "understanding."
Miss Anna Beward U747-18O9). a noti
erary woman of her day. ami a native,
like Dr. Johnson, of LlchrtHd. though
often astray in her critical opinions, was
probably nearer right tha: when
she wrote In Â»uper-J<>h' - urase:
"For the first time I saw .. cele
brated Mrs. Slddons In comedy, | n Rosa

ing as her frown id moxnltl'-ent, as her
tears nre Irresistible, yet : .: scin

Mrs. Jordan, Indeed, must tmvA been a
veritable Konallnd as the <lr.-im.uist de
pleted her. She first appeared in the part
for her own benefit April LI. 1757. and was
"triumphantly successful." The poet
Campbell declared that Shakespeare him
self would have jrone Mind the scenes
to congratulate hrr. She continued to
play Rosalind as late as 1777.

MEXICAN MORPHY'S
LOCAL TURF CAREER
Nearly Lost His Diamonds in the
Baldwin Hotel Fire â A Plumber's
Reward That Never Came.
Tho acquaintance and friends acquired
en the turf this *lde of the border by
Santiago Morphy. recently sentenced in
the City of Mexico to spend nine rear*
of hi? lifÂ«Â» in prison for embezzlement,
were busy recalling incidents in the cu
rwr of the dapp< r Mexican youth at the
ricetrack yesterday.
Am ' Mexican Morphy" this polished
handsomely groomed and muchly be-
J.-w<led young fellow began his rainbow
rÂ»r<*r on the Eastern tracks â¢luring the
feason of IWV Ho apparently had money
to burn, â¢â¢â¢!>â¢ â¢ pood bettor and very soon
was taken under the protecting wing of
Will Wallace, nt one time â :â¢â¢ running
matf of Rilev Grannan. Finally Morphy
became ambitious to become an owner,
and for a time created consternation
ktnotiK owners by bidding up a number of
winnrrn of celling races which he thought
"in too cheap." Probably the best horses
which sported his colors were Den Hadad
und Estata. With the former In made
:wo or three mild "killings."
Shortly after the opening of the local
racing i*Â«a*on of ISHi Morphy Journeyed
t'-rnuN the continent with Jockey "fikeets"
Martin and was a familiar figure for a
â¢inn- Mt Ingleside and Oakland, being con
'lÂ«JÂ«tiil quite a plunger. Then came the
KaMwin Hotel :ire. Morphy occupied a
room on the second floor of the Powell
<-trÂ«-^t vide of the *tructure. During the
proRTeHS of the flames MÂ«X." who had
.'f+n out dining, made his appearance and
offered the plumber of the hotel 1100 If he
would remove his trunk to a place of
ntU-xy. This was accomplished with the
fcld <>f an onlooker, but the plumber still
awaits the fI(W reward. In a tin box In
the trunk were Jewelry and diamonds es
:lmated to be worth lIO.OM, besides a large

The Orpheum Is always at Its best In

In the vaudeville of yesteryear that lat

oversfiueaml.sh myself, but vaudeville Is
not "for men only." For a lime suggep

composite of wit and buffoonery, be It

excel him in comedy without his fund
of humor. His strength Is In the nice
blending of these two elements, where
fore I propound the paradox that he is to
be admired because he is laughed at.
When Golden was here a year ago I had !
to Und fault with him on th.- score of a
certain pretentiousness. He was fond of
using very big words Without knowing
how. He is not a scholar, and his subtle
assumption Â«of superiority never deceived.
This time I have caught him at his old

SUCCUMBS TO ILLNESS
BERKELEY. Dec. 13.â The Rev. Giles A. Easton, D. D. f passed away
shortly fore 5 o'clock this morning at his residence on the corner
of Bancroft way and Atherton street. Death came as the result of
long illness.
Dr. Easton was very well known throughout the State as one of the oldest
and most untiring worker? In the California diocese of the Protestant Episco
pal church. For almost forty years he has labored In different churches,
sometimes as rector, but In most cases as missionary pioneer In communities
where the service of God had not yet been started. The churches of many
of the cities In and about San Francisco owe their origin directly to his
efforts.
Dr. Easton was born In 1829, In Weston, N. Y. He first studied at Trinity
College In Connecticut, coming to California In 1&0 on a pleasure trip. After
one year as cashier of the Pacific Mall Company he returned to Connecticut,
graduating from his college In 1854. Crossing the plains again he became.
convinced of the urgent need for missionary work In this State and returned
to the East to fit himself for the work of the ministry. He graduated from
the Berkeley Divinity School at Mlddletown. Conn., in lKoSTarid In a few years
came to California once more. Since that time till within a few years ago
he has devoted himself unceasingly to his chosen life work.
Jrom 1562 to 1869 he was In charge of Grace Church, San Francisco, and
principal of Grace Institute. He left Grace Church In 1569 to found St.
Luke's Church in San Francisco. When the work of organization was com
plete. Dr. Easton left for San Mateo. and there became the founder of St.
Matthew's Church. Later he forsook this to start St. Peter's Church of
Redwood City. In IMI he went to Santa Cruz, remaining there until 1875 as
rector of Calvary Church. As delegate to the Episcopal Convention which
met In New York City In 1574 he presented the first petition for the organi
zation of a California diocese. After three years as chaplain of St. Augus
tine's College at Bonlcia Dr. Easton accepted a call to the Church of the
Good Shepherd at West Berkeley, officiating there until I*B3, when he as
sumed charge of St. Mark's Episcopal Church on Bancroft way. Here he
stayed until 1595, when he retired from the active work of the ministry as
rector emeritus.
There survive him a widow, one daughter, Mrs. W. R. Porter, and four
sons. Klmball G.. Stanly A.. Robert E. and Berkeley. The time of the funeral
has not yet been set. The services will be held In St. Mark's Episcopal Church,
the Right Rev. W. F. Nichols, Bishop of California, officiating, assisted by
the Rev. George E. Swan of Berkeley.

OAKLAND. Dec. llâ Mrs. F. M. Smith i

Into any controversy with any one in re-
to her proposition to celebrate New
Years toy by a "revival of an old cus- |
torn." In a most dignified and courteous I
manner Â»he reiterate! her intention of !
celebrating New rear*! day by "keeping
open BOOM to her friends," and at the
same time she refuses i<> make further
â tatementfl as to the programme that she
proposes for that day or the menu that
the will offer her guests. So It Is that
one of the leaden of Oakland societ> \
refuse* to modify any of her plans or, at i
the same time, give to the public more

New gear*! day at Arbor Villa." said Mrs.
Smith to-day, "and so the custom is
: nothing new lor us. I propose to wish my
friends a happy New Your with a dig- ;
nity betutlng the occasion, and 1 am quite '
suy. that there is no one on my list who
does not lespeol the standard which a
bostess chooses to set for her home. You i
will pardon me if I say that any further
discussion of my home or guests seems
to me unnecessary and a trlllo ridlcu
loub."
And so Mrs. Smith has closed the Incl- I
dent as far as she is concerned, but the i
Oakland tongue has been unhinged by It.
and everywhere there is discussion as to
whether the old system of New Year s call
should be revived, and if revived whether i
It will carry with it the attendant punch \
bowls and sideboards which have made â 
New Year's calls the buxt of so many

which Mrs. Smith has put her person

has made the discussion a general and
Impersonal one. and those who have |
spoken do so upon the general proposl- j
tion of tho revival of New Years calls.
â¢â¢Without any referenÂ« e to Mrs. Smith.
I would say that 1 oppose the celebration
of New Year's day when liquor is used,"
said Mrs C. J. Mills of Mills College.
"One of the reasons why New Year's calls
fell Into disuse was because of the abuse
of the occasion. It was well that that
feature of the practice has been dispensed
with, even if the custom of calling had
to be dispensed with."
"The custom of calling on New Year's
day." 6aid Mrs. J. K. McLean. "Is a %â¢ rv
pleasant one. and 1 am sorry that thÂ» j
custom has gone out. Of course It is noÂ»
necessary to abuse the custom because It
is a good one and it in needless to say
that I do not favor the use of liquors."
"I do not see anything remarkable in
the fact that open-house to one's friends
Is to be held upon New Year's day," said
Mrs. Charles Webb Howard. "I think that

QUEER PROCEEDINGS AT
INDIAN MURDER TRIAL
OAKLAND, Dec. 13.â Man's inhumanity to man In a mild form was aptly
Illustrated to-day In the case of seven California Indians'â four squaws
and three bucksâ who for the past two dnys have desertvd their ranch
erla near Pleasanton to attend a* witnesses the trial of Frank Bhenave.
charged with the murder of Frank Florets, whom ho stabbed ilurlng a drunken
brawl at the Indian rancherta several week* aro. Tin- Indians had been sub
penaed by thr prosecution, and they appeared a motley, dusky thrnng a(Â«_^h''y
sat Indifferently listening to the proceedings in Jwlge Ogdcn'fl court yesVr
day and to-day. When court adjourned laat evening they remained half
asleep on the benches In the lobby until Interpreter J. J. Alvlso Inquired of
Court Clerk Baker. "What are you going to do with these witnesses?" Ba
ker remarked that he "did not want them." but the same query nut to Judge
Ogden resulted In an order that they must be provided with food and lodging
over night. D. M. Connor, attorney for the defense, shelled out 70 cents,
enough for f'lerk Baker to pay for a meal around at a Japanese eating
house, and thereafter they were taken to the County Jail. With great diffi
culty were the Seven witnesses persuaded to enter the Jail and lodge behind
the gray walls and Iron bars for the night.
This morning Sheriff Ropt-rs escorted them to a restaurant for breakfast,
and when noon arrival and Clerk Baker was again at-ked to take the Indians
out to lunch he demurred that he was "out of society," So Deputy District
Attorney Harris advanced 25 cents each for their meals.
The murder trial closed for argument this afternoon and the seven Indians
were lined up before Judge Ogden to arrange about their fees, when Attorney
Connor stepped forth with a claim of 70 cents: Attorney Harris vow
wanted $175 advanced for their lunch: Sheriff Rok*ts demanded pay for
eeven meal* supplied at 20 cents each, and matters hi ram.* quite complicated,
when Judge Ogden summarily decided to advance each Indian 25 cent* for
supper and allowed them enough to pay their fares back tfl Pleaxantun.
In commenting upon these Indians as witnesses Deputy District Attorney
Samuels In hip argument referred to their peculiar characteristics of abso
lutely disregarding the seriousness of an oath and of having râptel only for
their living ajid caring not a straw for their dead. The prosecutor said he
did not ask for a verdict of murder In the flrst degree. The case will go to
the Jury to-morrow morning.

do nnd I see nothing to discuss in the
matter.
T he N Â£ w YeR T' raM custom fell Into
disuse â because the serving of liquor be
came, a part of the custom." said Mrs.
J^TSiff 1 Pel i on -. chairman of the press
(ommltt.., of the Woman's Christian
Temperance Union. "The custom was a
good one but the feature of liquor serv
ing killed it and it wan better that a
pleasant custom should fall than that the
Â«,?)?Â« r should 4be Bervetl. It Is not within
our province to discuss Mrs. Smith's home
affairs, for she may belong to the same
class as did the wife of President Hayed,
who never offered wine to a visitor, or
Mrs. Rockefeller, who received calls on
New \enrs day and served coffee or
chocolate. The calling was nice, but the
abuse to which It was subjected was very
harmful.
"I object to sideboards or punch bowls,
but have no particular thought one wav
or the other upon New Year's calls." said
Mrs. 1... R. Webster.
"Sociability without wine Is pleasant
and proper. said Miss Williams of the
loung women's Christian Association
"I read with pleasure that Mrs. F. M
Smith was going to revive the old custom
of New Year's calling." said Mrs. Mar
garet Blake-Alverson. "and then I read
that she was being criticised for her gen
erosity. For that I am sorry. My father,
a minister of the gospel, always set aside
that day to receive his people and his
friends, and I have never In all these
years failed to keep open-house on that
occasion. I suppose that it was not con
sidered fashionable, but It was my day
for receiving old friends. â¢ We cannot all
do as much as dear Mrs. Smith, but we
can do as the Lord has prospered us. We
all have friends, no matter what our sta
tion In life, and at such a time our friends
will find us If they know we are ready for
them. I for one will keep open-house And
I know no one will go from my door reel
ing." .
"I think that It Is a revival of a nice
custom, provided it is revived without liq
uor." said Mrs. 8. C. Borland of the W. C.
T. XJ. "Mrs. Smith Is a great hostess and
has done much for Oakland society, and I
believe that she will do much more by
not serving liquors. Those are merely my
principles and not a criticism of Mr-
Smith, who I believe will act always for
the best." : -:\.
And the discussion has started and Is
apparently without end. : â â Â«â â

FEAR OF LOSING
HIS EYESIGHT
DROVE HIM MAD
Sad Case of Robert
J. Stanton.
Oakland Office Pan Francisco Call,
WS Broadway, Dec. 13.
The fear that he would become totally
blind before he could return to hi* child
hood^ home In Ireland has unhinged thÂ«
mind of Robert J. Stanton, aged 28 nan
who is being detained at the Receiving
Hospital for Insanity. Ilia case Is truly
a pad one.
Stanton came to this country about â¦en
yearn . ago and soon found employment
with the Southern Pacific Company. About
a year a*.,. while engaged in driving
spikes at track-laying in West Oakland
a piece of ilsh plate snapped and struck
him In the left eye. The metal pene
trated to a depth that necessitated the
extricating Of . the eyeball, and since then
" t . on . has been employed In and about
the yards at West Oakland. During tne
FhÂ« l .i f Er , w Â£? ks Â£ c complained tl.-.t
the sight of his other eye was slowly
over it* and he worried a great rt " al
t^n. ll^. fearing that he might become
totally blind, he concluded to apply to the
r ?i lr ? ad ftuthorltlea for passage to his
old home in Ireland. Thla afternoon he
?l a .i to . nay e called on the paymaster to
cann time checks for about $50. and be
was to have received tickets entitling him
to transportation across the continent and
across the Atlantic to his old home; but
continual worrying over the dread fear
that he might become blind before he
could see his parents for the last time un
balanced him mentally, and last evening
on the very eve of his hopes being juiriial
ly realized, he was arrested for lnsanl'y
He now labors under the hallucination
that several men are constantly pursuing
him with the intention of murdering him
then throwing his body Into a vacant lot
they would set up the claim that he was
Insane and committed suicide.
"All night long for several nights now
have i walked the floor of my room "
said Stanton to-day, "and I feel that if I
once go to sleep these men will kill me.
You nay it is alt imagination and that IT
I go to Stockton Insane Asylum the doc
tors may rid me of that horrible idea If
that Is true I most certainly am willing to
go there."
Another man. R. H. Teggart. also
employed until recently by the railroad
as a section hand, was arrested to-day
at the West Oakland yards for Insanity.
Teggart has been out of work for some
time, and to-day threw himself in front
of a switch engine at the foot of Peralta
street with suicidal Intent. The engineer
saw him In time and stopped the locomc
tive before Teggart was struck. At the
Receiving Hospital it was found that the
unfortunate man was In a starving
condition. He declared that he was not
Insane, but nearly starved to death; that
he had not eaten any food for several
days, and hence he had concluded to end
his misery. Teggart Is aged 35 yeans and
will be examined by the Lunacy Com
missioners to-morrow.

FIVE MORE SYMPHONY
CONCERTS NEXT YEAR
TALK OF COMBINING THE TWO
ORGANIZATIONS.
Henry Holmes Chosen as Permanent
Leader of the San Francisco
Symphony Orchestra.
The symphony question has at last been
definitely settled. The new society, under
whone auspices the trial symphony was
given, met on Monday evenln* and de
cfctod to Rive a series of flve concerts, to
begin on January IS. under the direction
of Henry Holme.". So far it Is not yt't
decided where these concerts will take
place, but It will be announced some time
nrxt week. '*P to the time the new
society agreed upon a course of flve con
certs It wax reported that the old society
had the Intention to enKagc Mr. Holmes,
but as matters now stand this plan be
comes useless. The next move will be to
unite the two societies. It is the intention
of the board of directors of the new
society to Invite the old subscribers to
attencl a mass-meeting and proceed to
unite in one large body. This is the story
of this new organization. But some mem
bi ; s of the old board of directors who
have been asked state that It was not
their intention to encage Mr. Holmes, as.
according to their opinion, he is not satis
factory- and that they are still waiting
for a conductor who would make a worthy
follower to Fritz Pcheel. However, the
main point is that there will be more sym
phony concerts, which speaks well for'the
musical taste In this city.
Prince Poniatowski the Fourth.
The third son of Prince and Princess
Poniatowski made his debut on life's
stage last evening:, and the event afforded
pleasure In the household of his parents
and kin. The country residence of the
Prlnc Is EurllnKame, but the younjrster
had tho metropolitan taste to be born In
San Frnnci.sco. The text used to be
quoted by the old families of New Eng
land "that one must be born again to be
M.Yed unless born In Boston." In this era
of expansion San Francisco may be in
cluded In the exception. The event In the
Prince's family took place at the city resi
dence of Mr. and Mrs. \V. H. Crocker.

her from me. On Sunday I went to see
her. She looked upon our separation as a
punishment. "What have I done, mamma,
that 1 cannot live with you?" she said.
Mrs. Wood has no great comfort in the I
midst of all her trouble. She had thought \
the experience of the Indiscretion of her ;
youth would make her few friends turn
from her. She miscalculated the depth of
the friendship of th -â¢â¢ who knew and !
loved her. Her misfortune has made closer
the ties that bound her to friends and
neighbors. Her place of refuge now Is the
home of a friend who for more than live
years learned to know and respect her as
a neighbor.
DANIELS REPUDIATED.
December IS. 1R93.
To the ndltor of Th* Pan Francisco Callâ
Sir: In your Ifsuc of the 12th lnst. you pub
lifh a purported Interview with one B. G.
Daniels. In which Mr. Daniels make* various
assertions about the manner In which Mr.
Heed acquired possession of the property of
which he died potsesErd. Mr. Daniels has talked
with considerable assurance of matters of
which he Is profoundly Ignorant. He pays:
"Mr. Heed In his declining years realized that
In his earlier days when Spanish Â»ran;.-Â«
kr.Â»w not the pritypectlve value of their lands
liÂ«- had taken advantage of Innocence. Ileln*
unable to mÂ»k- restitution directly to those
with whom he <JÂ«*alt. he wiped out the wren*
of former years by restoring part of his prop
erty to the little heiress. â¢ â¢ â¢ When Heed
laid the foundation of his fortune much of
the territory whÂ«-re he Fettled was held by
the Mexicans, and the knavery of Horace Car
pentler, who lmi-errnr.ated a priest In order to
Induce old Don Peralta to deed away his herit
age In A lamed* County, was not unknown on
the other side of the bay. Among those who
are credited with taking similar advantage*
was John J. Heed. but. unlike Carpentler, thÂ«
Ran Hafael c*p!tall?t In the evening of his
life listened to h!s conscience. â¢ â¢ â¢ I have
heard that FWd wns not alt.">gethÂ»r ratified
with the manner In which he acquired some
of his property."
The above statements are the. results of a
very vlvij und mischievous Imagination.
Where Mr. Danifls obtained the Information
which he dlrclriÃÂ»Â»s with such nn air of assur
ance the family of the late Mr. Heed are un
aware. Every one of the above statements
of Mr. Daniels Is false. As a matter of trim.
thÂ« late John J. He<*d Inherited every Inch of
his land I row his father, who acquired it Iv
Krant frum the Mexican Government. Juan
K'-ed. the father of the late John J. Heed, was
an early settler In California, and all his
property was acquired through legitimate nnd
honorable methods. In ISSi the title to the
Heed lards was perfected by a patent issued
by the Unlu-d Slates Government. Mr. Dan
iels It I stranger to every member of the Heed
family, none of them know who this wiseacre
ts, and they take this means of denying his
statements and correcting the false lmpres
flrns they may have created. Mr. Reed never
In all his long life deprived any person un

transactions did Justice to his fellow men.

SHOULD HAVE A GUARDIAN.
William H. Kruse's Case Taken Up
by Judge Coffey.
The application of Edward Krue for
letters of guardianship over the person
of his brother. William H. Kruse, was
taken up by Judge Coffey yesterday. Tes
timony was offered to show that William
H. *Â« weak In mind and body through
prolonged carousals and that It was nec
essary that a guardian be appointed.
Judge Coffey said that In his opinion he
Fhould have a guardian and that he was
willing to appoint the petitioner, but
could not do so until the residence of the
ward had been established. William II
has been living on a farm In Sonoma
County for pome time, and If he has a
legal residence there Judge Coffoy would
have no Jurisdiction over either his per
son or estate. In consequence the case
went over until such time as the peti
tioner can present proofs that William
H. is a legal resident of this city and
sÂ«mply went to live on the farm at the
suggestion of his brother for his health
and to avoid temptation.

TWO MEN USED RAZORS

ing, went out on the bloody and un
hallowed tide of suicide yesterday.
Both usod the razor as the means of

The llrst reported to the Coroner was
P. 11. Walther. an old citizen. He went to

neck.
The second unfortunate took a room at
the Berkeley lodging-house at 18 Mason
street on the evening previous, and was
found yesterday afternoon with hi* throat

Mr. Walther was a barber by trade, but
up to eighteen months ago was associated
in the saloon business at 207 Grant avenue
with J. Rumetsch. He sold his Interest to
his partner. Mr. RumetSCh, and Bince that
time did not appear to be doing anything.
It was ascertained b" the condition of
the body that the deceased took a bath,
then partly dressed himself and smoked
a cigar. Then he spread the towels care
fully alongside the bathtub on the floor
and drew the edge of a razor across the
nape of his neck, severing the spinal cord
und killing him instantly. A bather in an
adjoining room taw something red ooz

broke in the door and found \\ alther
dead. . ,
On the person of the dead man was
found among other things a letter In Ger
man, written by him to his partner. The
letter was in a despondent vein and to
the effect that he had got tired of looking
for something to do and that ho had de
termined to end his life by suicide. The
further statement was made that he had
Intended to be cremated, but that he was
then ready to go to the grave.
The deceased was a member of Herman

ress yesterday. The defense Introduced
a few witnesses In the forenoon and then.
at 10:30 o'clock, announced that the case
was closed so far M Frenna was con
cerned. District Attorney Murphy desired

WOMEN.
Fred Dennis, an employe of the South
ern Pacific Company, was robbed of a
purse containing $102 and two valuable
diamond rings early yesterday morning.
Shortly before ml<J night Dennis, who was
out for a "good time." as ho expressed It
to the police, was walking along Market
street, when he met a well-dressed
stranger, who ask.-.l him to Join htm In a
drink. They visited several saloons and
when about to leave his new-found friend
Dennis was hailed by two young women,
who cajoled him Into buying a drink for
them. After leaving the women Dennis*
companion insisted that he should ac-
company him to his room on Folsom
street, near Sixth. After reaching the
stranger's room Dennis fell asleep, and
when he awakened several hours later his
money and diamonds were gone. A plain
Bold ring, which he had on his left Index
linger, was also missing. Dennis lost no
time In notifying Captain Bohen.who de
tailed Detectives Crockett and Dillon on
the case.
Prom his statement the detectives are
satisfied that he was drugged by the
stranger and then relieved of his money
and jewelry. Dennis described the thief as
being about 24 years of age. well dressed
and wearing a small dark mustache.
One of the rings contained twenty-one
diamonds, and was recently purchased by

the two women whom DenniH met were
pals of the man who was with him. They
called him "Jack" und seemed to on

KEMP CALLS
BERGEROT A
LITTLE CUR
Disgraceful Scene at
Board's Meeting.
AFTERMATH OF THE TROUBLE
PLAN TO PAY TEACHERS TWO
MONTHS' UNPAID SALARIES.
The aftermath of the differences exist
ing between Chairman Bergerot and
School Director Kemp over the latter*!
attempt to pave the way for electing a
batch of new teachers Into the depart
ment by amending sections IC3-9 of the
rules came at last night's meeting of the
Board of Education, and a disgraceful
scene marked the close of the proceed
ings. The trouble was precipitated when
Bergerot culled up for consideration
Kemp's notice to amend. Director Head,
who was absent at the previous meeting,
desired to have read that portion of the
minutes referring to the subject. After
It was dono Chairman Bergerot started
to _puLlhe_ question -to a. vote, when he
was interrupted by Kemp, who angrily
said:
"No. you don't. You played to the gal
lery last meeting night and I'll play 1/
the gallery next meeting night."
"\ou gave notice of consideration at
the last meeting," said Bergerot, "and we
I will take it up now. Mr. Kemp, you are
out of order. I told you once before that I
I would oppose your scheme of foisting '
teachers In the department when they are
: not needed. "
Kemp, recognizing In this an evident de
; sire ot Bergerot to humiliate him again
before the board by voting down his
proposition, as he knew Kemp did not
have the necessary seven votes, re
torted:
"I've got the floor and I propose to keep
It. You're all right, 1 don't think. You're
not half a man."
"I will not stoop to your level, sir," re
torted the chairman, at the same time
loudly rapping with his gavel.
"You are a little cur." said Kemp, and
amid a great deal of confusion Director
Stow moved to adjourn and the incident
came to an end.
Mrs. Garrett was appointed Janltress of
Gartield Primary School, vice Mrs. Kim
ball, resigned. Mrs. Kelly failed to get
Mrs. Black's position as janitrt -ss of the
Everett Grammar School, and Mrs. M. 1:.
McClellan did not have sufficient strengtn
In the board to take the place made va
cant by Mrs..Oarrett's transfer from Gol
- den Gate School. A motion to appoint
Mrs. Shields to the latter position was
lost, but she was temporarily appointed
by Chairman Bergerot.
Chairman Bergerot suggested that the
Finance Committee confer with the Au
ditor regarding the salaries of school
teachers for November and December,
189 S. which are yet unpaid.
"it is not legal to pay these salaries as
such, but now that there are sufficient ;
funds ii may be possible to Increase the
monthly salaries for the next six months
at the rate of two-twelfths of the total
amount due the teachers each month."
The Finance Committee will Investigate
the matter and report at the next meet-
Ing.
Mrs. R. Grennan, who was formerly
principal of the Sunnyvale School, re
quested thai she be assigned to a place
In Borne school without waiving her tights
to a prindpalship in the department. Di
rector Gedge's motion that the matter be
referred :> Superintendent Webster whs
lost and it will now go to the Elementary
Committee.
The South San Francisco Improvement
Club by revolution petitioned the board
for a new school building of sixteen rooms
to take the place of tho twelve-room
school now ordered. The latter will not be
large enough, as there are at the present
time 635 names on the roll and every day
there are new applicants. It will be re
cessary to hire outside rooms, as that
number 'vlll more than nil the twelve
rooms.
It w.is resolved and ordered that the
following a*HlKnment of teachers made
by thÂ« Superintendent of Schools
he confirmed: Miss L. n. Harridan to tiie
Moulder Prln?ary School, new clans; M Â»a
Elizabeth Donald from the day sutjjti
tute list to the Noe Valley Primary
School, new class; Miss J. Miles from the
day substitute list to the Franklin Gram
mar School, fourth Krade, new class; Miss
L,. Radford to the South End School, vi â¢â¢
Miss Gillmore; Miss If. Barrett from tne
day substitute list to tho Hawthorne Pri
mary School, vice Miss E. Smith; Miss
Hertha Dworsasek from the John Swott
Grammar School to the Redding Primary
School.
It was resolved that ninth prade pupils
who have been In said jrrade for twelve
months or more and who have completed
the course of study for said grade may
be examined for Rraduatlon by principals
in the following subjects, to wit.: Spell
ing. 50 credits: word analysis, 2" credits;

transcontlnpnt.il pmâ ngf agents, sched
iil.<l to take pine* In Chicago on the 19th
of this month.
The meeting has been called to see If the
dispute concerning differentials, which
originated a short time ago among the
different Massachusetts lines and which
resulted In rate cutting on the west
bound transcontinental passenger busi
ness, cannnot be bo adjusted as to re-
Ftore confidence and harmony between
the different lines that are now at outs
and whose differences threaten to sooner
or later Involve all their big connections
in a first-class rate war.
It Is thought that the trouble is merely
a litle flurry, which the meeting will have
small difficulty in settling, after which
It wili devote some time to a general dis
cussion of the many different matters
pertaining to passenger trafllc.
