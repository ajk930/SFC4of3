MANILA, T>c 19.â i
eral Henry Lawton ha*
been shot and killed at
San Mateo. He vvas standing in
front of his troops, was shot in
the breast and died immediately.
General Law ton left here Mon
day night, having returned frcm
his northern operations Satur
day to. lead an expedition
through Mariquina Valley, which
has been an insurgent stronghold
throughout the war. The valley
has several times been invaded
but never held by the Americans.
General Gcronimo was supposed
to have there the last organized
force north of Manila, and Gen
eral Otis wished to garrison Ma
riquina. The night was one of
the worst of the season. A ter
rific rain had begun and is still
continuing.
Accompanied by his staff and
Troop I. Fourth Cavalry, Gen
eral Lawton set out at 9 o'clock
in advance of the main force,
consisting of the Eleventh Cav
alry and fine battalion each of the
Twentieth and Twenty-seventh
Infantry, which started from La
Loma ii midnight. With a small
escort he led the way through an
almost pathless country a dis
tance of fifteen miles over hills
and through cam-brake and deep
mud, the horses climbing the
rocks and sliding down the hill.
Before daybreak the command
had reached the head of the valley.
The San Francisco Call
San Mateo wa^ attacked at 8
o'clock, and a three hours' fight
led. This resulted in but few
casualties on the American side,
Â»m the death of < ieneral
Lawton, but the attack was dif
ficult because of the natural de
fences of the town.
General Lawton was walking
g the firing line within 300
yards of a small sharpshooter's
trench conspicuous in the big
white helmet he always wore and
a light yellow rain coat. He was
also easily distinguishable be
cause of his commanding stature.
The sharpshooters directed
several close shots, which clipped
the grass near by. His staff < â¢:'
called Genera] Lawton's at
tention to the danger he was in.
but he only laughed with his
usual contempt for bullets.
Suddenly he exclaimed, "I am
shot!" clapped his hands in a des
perate effort to stand erect and
fell into the arms of a staff officer.
( >rderlics rushed across the field
I >r surgeons, who dashed up im
mediately, but their efforts were
useless. The body was taken to
a clump of bushes and laid on a
stretcher, the familiar white hel
met covering the face of the dead
general.
Almost at this moment the
cheers of the American troops
rushing into San Mateo were
mingled with the rifle volleys.

DENBY AND MILES PAY
TRIBUTE TO BRAVE LAWTON
CALL, HEADQUARTERS. WELLINGTON HOTEL, WASHINGTON,
Dec. 13.â 1 have hoard with inexpressible sorrow of the death of General
j .T* on. I feel It more because, he was an Indianan, and I know how deeply
ndiana will grieve for her most distinguished son. He, was the bravest of
the brave. From the Â»gÂ« of 19 he was a soldier. He rose from the ranks.
7 belonged to the Thirteenth Indiana Regiment, which covered itself with
glory during our own war. I knew him well in the Philippines. I vainly rea
soned with him as to his constant exposure in battle. He told me at that
time that he had hern in 165 fights. At Zapote Bridge he. did as he always
Old. He stood In the most exposed place that could be found. At one of the
bridges two Insurgent Runs were stationed on the other end of the bridge.
at a measured distance from Lawton of thirty-four yards. We had a gun
on our ond of the bridge. He stood there exposed to the fire of artillery and
of sharpshooters and of the infantry of the enemy. Wheaton stood be
side him. The Filipinos had ( .no to church the night before and had regis
tered an oath that no American should ever cross the bridge, which the Span
lards had n*ver boon able to do. Our men loaded their puns into a boat
and pushed it across thÂ« river, swimming, and charged the enemy on the
flank and drove them from their trenches, and Lawton crossed the bridge.
This was only one example of the personal heroism which he displayed
every day. He was an ideal soldier, as careful and prudent of everybody
but himself as he was brave. His loss will be terrible to his family con
sisting of his wife and four children now In Manila. It Is the most de
plorable event that could have happened to our army.
â¢ D. CHARLES HENRY.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 19.â 1n speaking to-night on the late General Law
ton. Major General Miles, commanding the army, said: "I have Just been
advised of the receipt of a dispatch from General Otis, announcing that
while driving the Insurgents near San Mateo. General Lawton wan instant
ly killed. His death is a great loss to the army and the country. He was a
very fine otllcer. He had a splendid record for courage and Judgment In
the civil war. He entered the service at the age of IS as a private soldier
and at the close of the war. when he was 22. he had the rank of lieutenant
colonel, and was a brevet colonel. During that conflict he participated in
many engagements and battles, displaying great bravery and frequently
distinguishing himself. Upon the conclusion of the war he entered the regu
lar army service and took part in several- Indian campaigns on the frontier.
I selected him for the command of one of the principal columns In pursuit
of Geronlmo. and he followed the Indians constantly for three months, cov
ering more than a thousand miles and did more to wear them down than
any one of the other commands. Ho was engaged In the severest part of
the tiring before Santiago, where he showed excellent, judgment and good
generalship,' and he has done the principal fighting in the Philippines. Ho
was a man of great energy, enterprising and fearless In actionâ a thorough
soldier. He was a very kind-hearted gentleman and noble: man. lie could
suffer injustices, but I never knew him to do an unjust act to any one."
WASHINGTON, Dec. 19.â
Admiral Dfwey, speaking of
the late General Lawton, said:
"I knew him and loved him.
He was the bravest of the
brave." It is interesting to
know in this connection the
high opinion held by Lawton
of Dewey. They were the
warmest personal friends, and
the great admiral had no more
ardent admirer than the great
general. In Manila public ad
mir.ition constantly coupled
their names and they were
beau id?als of the army and
navy fighting men.
many a tear fell from the eyes of
men who had long followed the
intrepid Lawton. The entire
command was stricken with grief
as though each man had suffered
a personal loss. Owing to the
condition of the country, which
is impassable so far as vehicles
are concerned, the remains could
not be brought to Manila to
day.
Mrs. Lawton and the children
are living in a Government resi
dence formerly occupied by a
Spanish general.
San Mateo lies between a high
mountain behind and a broad.
shallow stream in front, with
wide sandbars, which the insur
gent trenches and the buildings
command. The Americans were
compelled to ford the river under
(ire. It was while they were > ly
ing in the rice fields and volleying
across preparatory to passing the
stream that General Lawton was
shot. All except the officers were
behind cover. A staff officer was
wounded about the same time,
and one other officer and seven
men were wounded.
After three hours' shooting the
Filipinos were dispersed into the
mountains. Colonel Lockett
took command when General
Lawton fell.

The President's first Intimation of thÂ«
loss of General Lawton was given him by

Force Asked by Buller to Be Quickly
Recruited From Volunteers and
Called the "Imperial Yeomanry."
LONDON, Dec jo. 4:45
a. m. â The Government
ha? at last consented to
mobilize a force which (icneral
Ruller is credited with having
demanded all along as essential
to success in South Africa,
namely. 10.000 mounted infan
try. This morning the War ( of
fice issued an order to the effect
that the Government had decided
to raise for South Africa a
mounted infantry force to be
called "Imperial Yeomanry/
and to he recruited from yeo
manry, volunteers and civilians
possessing the requisite qualifi
cations. Enlistment will he for
one year, or during the contin
uance of the war. The men must
he between jo and 35 years of
age and of equal physique to the
ordinary cavalry soldier. ( offi
cers and men are to provide their
own horses and t<Â» wear neutral
tint cloth shooting jackets, noi
necessarily uniform, felt hats,
breeches and gaiters. All must
be good riders and marksmen.
The same order invites every
volunteer regiment that is linked
with a regular battalion serving
at the front to supply a full com
pany, which will take the place of
the mounted infantry of the regi
ment.
These arrangements are ex
pected to result in a considerable
force. The enrolled strength of
the yeomanry forces, which
originated in the troublesome
period of the revolution, is now
10,433. Their services have never
before been called for in war.
The Lord Mayor of London,
Alfrcil Newton, is raising and
equipping a force of a thousand
volunteers among the city corps.
The large city firms are contrib
uting the necessary expenses.

Vincent, commandant of the
Queen's Westminster Volun
teers, has also offered to raise a
regiment of a thousand picked
marksmen.

The British second class

Lord Kitchener from Egypt to

Special reports regarding the
fighting at the Tugela River are
still filtering through, but all the
newspapers complain that these
are severely censored, and it is
still impossible to get any accu
rate idea of the battle. From the
latest accounts, however, it ap
pears that General Buller was in
personal command.
A correspondent of the Asso
ciated Press at Chievclcy (amp
says the Boers excuse themselves
for firing on the stretcher
bearers by asserting that two
squads of the Connaught
Rangers took cover under
civilian bearers of the Red
Cross, and that this act drew the
Boer fire, three being killed and
several wounded.
Much anxiety is caused by the
fact that the War Office has not
yet received a full list of the
casualties at Tugela River.

Camp, three miles north of Ohleveley,
Friday, Dec. 15.â The action which was

Major Hushes of his staff was killed,
while Lieutenant Hon. F. H. S. Roberts

protect the British flank and threaten
that of th*> enemy.
. The British cavalry and field guns w^r<Â»
stationed on either wing. The naval gun*
were posted In a central position on th*
west ' side of the railway, while Colonel
Long, with his artillery, went to the east
side of the railway on the right of th^

The Boers had evidently fully extended

Tugela River and Fort Wylle. which
stands upon the ridge nearest th? brldg*.
With skill and labor the Boers had built
walls and forts and had dug successive
trenches on the road, commanding every
line of approach from Estcourt to Co

troops, therefore, had to advance, M Tu

The battle commenced before < o'clock

reply to the heavy cannonade which our
bluejackets directed upon them. Few of
the enemy were visible. They lay hidden
behind their hill works, but on our In

Colenso a sharp musketry fire was opened
on them by the Boon from houses on th<*

BRAVE MAN'S UTTER
CONTEMPT FOR DANGER
MILWAUKEE. Wls.. Dec. 19.-General
Charles King, who commanded a brigade
in General Lawton'l division up to Juno
lust in the war against the Filipinos, was
much depressed on .'ring of tho death
; of his former commander. General King
paid a warm tribute to the dead general
! In tho following words:
â "lh<- <:â¢ .r. :i of General Lawton Is a
1 calamity, yet one that I have been in
, dread of ever since ho took command of
: our division last March. In point of dash,
I energy and endurance ho waa our best.
His one fault lay In his utter contempt
for danger. We could not prevail upon
i htm to use 'cover* or shelter of any kind.
Ho wÂ«s perpetually running Into every
I kind of danger, exposing himself to death
or capture when there was no need in it.
He wanted to see everything for himself
I and would stalk out in front of the lines,
the most prominent figure on tho Held.
I We loved himâ we always have ever since
: old Civil War days, when he was the
i hatdest and most daring of all the band
i of young officers that won distinction un
der Crook. Miles and MÂ«rntt. He was
Mackenzie's 'right bower* and his later
work in the Philippines was incompara
1 ble. An a friend and comrade he was an
lovable or ho was great and heroic as a
soldier."
LIFE OF THE GALLANT
GENERAL H. W. LAWTON
Henry W. Lawton wan bom In Manhat
tan, now a part of Toledo. Ohio. In 1843.
His mother was of the famous Oroote
family of Holland ajid his father was of
Knglish stock. An a boy young Lawton
went to school at Fort Wayne. He studied
law for a brief period at Harvard Uni
versity and practiced for a short time
after the civil wax.
"When the civil war broke, out and the

Lawton, then a boy 18 years old. enlisted
In the Ninth Indiana Volunteers, April 16,
He served under General Morris In
West Virginia aa sergeant of Company K.
During the three months he took part In
the battles of Phlllppl. laurel Hill and
Patricks Ford. He was mustered out by
the expiration of service and Immediately
organized a company for the war. and In
September. 1861, he was mustered In ss
llrs-t lieutenant of Company A, Thirtieth
Indiana Volunteers, which regiment was
ordered to the Department of the Ohio,
under General Buell.
Lawton soon showed his military abil
ity, and on the very field of battle in front
of Corinth. May 17, 1562. he was promoted
to a captaincy. He commanded his com
pany In all the operations of General
BuelTs army and the Army of the Cum
berland until July, I*>fi4, when ho was as
signed to duty by General Grose, com
manding a brigade in tho Fourth Corps,
as Inspector on his staff. In this capacity
I-Awtnn served until November. 1W54, when

regiment, he having been promoted -to a

years of age. He was commissioned a

as colonel of volunteers March 13. l v
"gallant and meritorious service during
the war." This boy of 22 had been through
thirty-six battles and was a veteran of
the most terrible war of modern timr-s.
He had served continuously during the
1 whole period of the war, excepting the
few months whÂ«n he was detached as in
spector on the staff of General Gro.Â«e in

LAWTON ALWAYS LED.
An Officer Who Never Told His Men
to Go On.
General LawtOO was one of the most
picturesque characters In tho array. Soon
after tho battle of El Caney. in July, IS**.
Where Law-ton's bravery and gallant lead
ership won f^r him now laurels, a friend,
EL S. Canfleld. wrote of him:
"Lawton reminds mo always of Scott's
Norman liaron. Front de Hoeuf. He has
better morals, of course, as well as a very
pretty taste In red wines and reed birds,
but he Is as bit as the giant slain by
Richard of the Lion Heart. Is as direct In
his methods, and In personal or general
combat every bit as savage. There Is
plenty of the primal man in him. "What
he thinks he says. He has a strong sense
of Justice, but his temper is terrific and he
is not gentle. 11.- requires of his subor
dinates the utmost endeavor, and gets it.
He asks no one to do work that he is not
competent and willing to do himself. Nat
urally a leader, ho goes Brat, and the
more difficult or desperate the undertak-
Ing the faster he goes. Upon the gray
granite slab which covers the molderlng
bones of a Confederate officer who sleeps
on the magnolla-petaled uplands of Loui
siana is an inscription: 'He never told his
men to go on.' That will do for Lawton
when he die*.
"He is Blx feet three Inches high. He
weighs 210 pounds, and nearly every ounce
of ft Is bone and blood and tendon and
muscle. He Is 65 years old and as springy
as a youth. His capacity to go without
food, drink or sleep Is seemingly unlim
ited. 'Macumazahn,' the Zulus called
Quatermalnâ 'the one who has his eyes
open.' Macumazahn Lawton will keep
them open for a week at a stretch, when
necessary, and then walk, talk, eat, drink
or fight a zen men to a standstill. He
has lived a life of peril and hardship. His
only rule of hygiene Is a tub in the morn-
Ing. He has taken no sort of care of him
self, yet so splendidly was he endowed by
nature that there Is no perceptible weak
ening of his forces. Apparently he Is as
powerful and enduring as when I saw him
first. That was more than ten years ago.
He had completed one of the most re
markable feats of strength and persever
ance chronicled In the long annals of the
Anglo-Saxon race, but he was as fresh as
a rose In the morning.
"He stood In the Government reserva
tion at San Antonio surrounded by the
tawny savage band of Chirlcahua Apaches
whom he had hunted off their feet. Near
him, taciturn but of kindly visage, stood
young Chief Xaches, almost as tall as he.
In a tent close by lay Geronlmo, the medi
cine man. groaning from a surplusage of
fresh beef eaten raw. The squat figures
of the hereditary enemies of the whites
grouped about him came only to his
shoulder. He towered among them, stern,
powerful, dominantâ an Incarnation of the
spirit of the white man, whose war drum
has beat around the world. Clad in a
faded, dirty fatigue Jacket, a greasy flan
nel shirt of gray, trousers so soiled that
the stripe down the leg was barely visible,
broken boots and a disreputable sombrero
that shaded the harsh features burned al
most to blackness, he was every Inch a
soldier and a man. To the other officers
at the post the Indians paid no sort of at
tention. To them General Stanley and his
staff were so many well-dressed lay fig
ures, standing about as part of a picture
done for their amusement, but the huge,
massive man with the stubble on his chin
had shown them that he was their supe
rior on hunting grounds that were theirs
by birthright, and they hung around his
lightest word.
"For the tenth timÂ« Gcronlmo's band
had Jumped the San Carlos reservation.
The spring grass .was two Inches high and
the Indian lust for blood was awoke. As

usual, troops were startod upon a perilous
chase. For days they followed the trail
over a country that God Almighty made
In wrath. Farther and farther Into the
vast solitudes they tolled. Volcanic crests
reared about them. Lava tori- the leather
from their feet. They drank from spring*
that gushed thousands of feet above the
valleys. They wandered In canyons <o
deep and darK that through the narrow
ribbon of white far above them thÂ© stars
were -en at midday. They lived upon
animals no wilder than the men they were
pursuing, and scarcely more wild" than
they. Now and then, from a forest of
pines far above- them, a shred of blue
smoke drifted on the furnace air, followed
by the shrill of the bullet's wild singing.
The horses long since had been left be
hind. The cavalrymen were on foot, with
Lawton nt their head, hi* teeth hard set
"We'll walk them down.' he told his ser
geant when the mountains were reached.
He was walking thÂ»m .lown.
"Six weeks afterward an Indian, whose
bones seemed ready to start through his
skin, came to the camp and said that
Oeronimo was ready to surrender. I^aw
ton went alone to the lair of the starving
wolves and received their submission.
Cavernous eyes glared at him. Lips black
from thirst and hunger were drawn back
over discolored teeth. Skeleton fingers
pointed at him. From skeleton Jaws came
sounds of pleadings mixed with wrath.
The poison of bitter racial hatred was In
every glance. 'Even the rocks smelled
like mad Indian. ' he told me. with a
laugh, long afterward. He lounged among
thenr. their master by virtue of superior
courage and strength and hardihood, and
they followed him like sheep to food and
Imprisonment. That Is the story In out
line of the capture of Oeronlmo. physi
cian, wizard, conjurer, orator and mur
derer.
"The man of El Caney Is the man of the
Mogollons. and the man of the Mogollons
is the reincarnation of some shining, hel
meted giant warrior who fell upon the
sands of Palestine In the first crusade,
with the red blood welling over his corse
let and his two-handed battle-sword shiv
ered to the hilt. The race-type persists
unchanged In eye, In profile. In figure. It
Is the race which In all the centuries the
Valkyrs have wafted from the wardecks,
have hailed from the holm-gangs or hel
met-strewn moorlandsâ the white-skinned
race, which, drunk with the liquor of bat
tie, reeled around the dragon standard at
Benlac, which fought with Richard Oren
vllle. which broke the Old Guard at
Waterloo, which rode up the slope at Bal
aklava, which went down wit4i thÂ« Cum
berland In Hampton Roads, which charged
with Plckett at Gettysburgâ the race of
the trader, the financier, the statesman,
the Inventor, the colonizer, the creator,
but, before all. the fighter."

ADVERTISEMENTS.
THE HEALTH HABIT.
Just as Easy to Form as Any Other.
We do not deliberately form our pet
habits, but they are unconsciously ac-
quired and grow as we grow, and by the
time we learn .they aro hurting us. wa
find them too strong to be easily broken.
Then, why not form a good habit, a
habit which will counteract the many bad
ones. In other words contract the un-
fashionable habit of being always well? â¢
The best health habit to get Into Is to
have and keep a vigorous stomach; If you
have a healthy digestion you can drink
your beloved coffee, smoke your favorita
brand of tobacco, with little or no harm:
the mischief begins when these things ara
forced upon the faithful stomach with-
out any assistance.
Form the habit of taking after meals
some harmless but efficient dlgestlvo
which will relieve the stomach of so much
extra work.
Nature furnishes us with such diges-
tives and when they are combined In
such a pleasant preparation as Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets, they give the over-
worked etomach Just the necessary as-
sistance to secure perfect digestion with-
out any of the harmful effects of cathar-
tics and similar drugs.
Th.> habit of taking Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets after meals la as necessary to tha
weak stomach as food Itself, and indeed
to get the benefit from food eaten nothing
better and certainly nothing safer can be
used.
Many famlles consider Stuart's Tablet*
as essential In the house as knives and
forks.
They consist entirely of natural diges-
tive principles without the effect or char-
acteristics of drugs; they hare no ca-
thartic action, but simply go to work on
the food eaten and d!gest It.
Take Into account your bad habits and
the expense they entail and then Invest ' )
cents In a box of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tub-
lets and see If your digestion for the next
month Is not vastly Improved.
Ask the clerk In any drug store the
name of the most successful and popular
stomach remedy and he will aajr
"Stuart's."

SCURRY TO COVER
New York Banks Stay the Panic
on 'Change by Unloosing
a Golden Stream.
NKW YORK. Dec. 19-Ther* was a com
riÂ°'<*. revolution of sentiment In Wall
street to-day, nnd the latter part of thÂ«
KSKlnn of the Stork Exchange witnessed
Kotnethin^ HI;..- a i.ir.k- among: tho bears,
who were making frantic efforts to *e
run* Flock? to cover short contracts, and
bidding prices up on themselves. The
professional traders took the lons tide of
th<Â» ir.arkct and Lid up prices to take the
market away from the hears. Many oi>
â¢rators who had ruthlessly sacrificed their
holdings In the i)and<-monium of yester
day wore also eager buyers. In the hope
of retrieving losses. Besides these ele
ments there was a large contingent of
bargain-hunter*, made up of people with
ready money looking for investment, and
who buy outnght to hold.
Some such revulsion of feeling wap a
natural consequence of the violent decline
of yesterday, which overran Itself. The
Issue of the speculative conflict was by
no means certain until about midway of
the pension, and yesterday's tide" of disas
ter was not stemmed without titanic exer
tions on the part of the most powerful
financial interests in the country acting In
concert. Millions of dollars In money were
forthcoming for the extension of credits
to buyers of securities. The clearing
house bankt* supplemented their yester
day's contribution of 510.000.0D0 by another
<>f the Fame amount to be loaned at the
market rate. The announced determina
tion of the Secretary <<t the Treasury to
increase Government deposits In deposi
tory li.-inks pave promise of relief fr>>m
ti.e start and funds estimated at 17,000.003
became available from this .source before
the market closed.
I'r.d- r the Influence of this abundance
yesterday's parle rites for money were
Â«i no time aj>pr<-achrd. but the demnnd
jvÂ»r loans made inroad? on the supply
with seemingly Insatiable appetite. Ttie
ratÂ»Â« went 10 z:> per cent; but steadily de
clined from that jxiint under the offerings
.if successive millions until U was forced
down t.> â¢; j<r oent, and in the latÂ«Â» after
noon fell .<j 1)4, i>, 3 and at last to 2 rcr

The early hours of th<Â» trading witness
ed very heavy '.: ;::â :..:: â :; In continuance
of yesterday's process of recuperation,
but there was no approach to thÂ« panic
conditions of yesterday at any time. The
extensive and elaborate preparations
made to moot the crisis were evident at
the opening and prlcÂ«* were opened at
large advances all through the list. The
result was helped by the higher quota
tions pent over fmm London, where the
htock exchange had a false rumor of s
jiartinl retrieval Â»>f General Buller of his
recent disaster. The high prlcea for
Americans In the London market were
doubtless due In part to manipulation or
<l'-r> - cabled from this side. In furtherance
of the general plan to sustain and pro
tÂ»Tt thfÂ» market. The opening advance
w.'is mÂ«-t by an avalanche Â«>f liquidating
s-aW, wlilrh promptly drove down prices
Jn !Â«plte <>f the utmost efforts to sustain
them. Not a few FtoÂ«*ks showed evl

two hours of trading were given up to
furious activity and Indescribable con
fUKton of nÂ«Â»ntiment.

The failure of the bank and the rise of
the German rate of discount and interest,
the latter from 7 to 8 per cent, did not
appear to have any serious effect on the
market here. The general feeling on tne
street was that the conditions were btt
ter. This was not a little due to the un
presslon gained from private advices that
Â«n arrangement had been reached in New
York over night to support the market
and prevent a recurrence of yesterday's
panic.
It is hardly thought that the rise In
the German discount rate will cause a
corresponding increase of the English
bank rate.
The transactions on the Stock Exchange
were again unmarked by a serious amount
Of liquidation. There was a plethora of
offers to sell, but buyers were hard to
find. Consequently, many shares were
marked down, though not to such an
extent as yesterday. The lack of actual
transactions was generally due to the.
feeling that the larger houses will do
nothing until it is known wh-ther or not
the French bank rate will be raised. It
is believed in pome Quarters that, if this
occurs, the Hank of England will follow
suit with .1 resulting Increase in the grav

would raise its rate, though It would not
be definitely known until to-morrow.

NO WOUNDS ON
LORRAINE'S BODY
Officers Certain That He
Was Murdered.
Spec! .-. Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, De 19â When Sheriff
Taylor. Deputy Sheriff Miller and Coroner
Eden reached Carson Canyon to-day thy
found the body of Peter Lorraine, the old
woodrhopper. who disappeared on May 1
lust, lying in a clearing on the hillside,
with one hand raised toward heaven, as
if mutely invoking vengeance from the
powerÃ above on the head of his assassin.
I There the body has lain for eight long
I months while searching parties have
j scoured the region in vain. Now that the
! link needed lias been found the man be
lieved to be tho murderer has dlsap-
I peared, and the authorities are forced to
admit that the chances of his apprehen
sion are indeed slight.
The discovery of the remains was made
by Pedro Sals, an Indian who went to
work for John Enos, the foreman of the
woodchoppers' camp, last Sunday. Yes
terday Sals was given the cabin formerly
occupied by Dler and "French Pete and
sent to work In the vicinity of where the
body wus found. He returned and In
| formed Enos of what he had seen, where
upon the foreman repaired to the scene
with two Swedes. Verifying the Indian'!
j tale. Enos returned to his house and
I shortly afterward went to San Geronimo
i and telegraphed Sheriff Taylor.
An examination of the body to-day
' failed to reveal any signs of violence ex
cept a hole In the hat, which might have
been made with a rifle or a club.
The failure to discover any signs of
how the man was killed shows nothing,
|as only the bones remained. Lorraine
< might have been cut in pieces or choked
I and the fact could not be shown. Coroner
Eden brought the remains to town and
took them to the Morgue. The Inquest
will be held to-morrow morning at 10
I o'clock.
rT Taylor brought Bye men here to

Turning to the officers Machlno cx
i plained that he knew Dler and Lorraine
I had frequently quarreled, and that once
I Dler went to San Francisco and bought a
revolver with the declared Intention of
"doing Pete up." The old man was de
tained as a witness.
The place where the body was found Is
j about 1000 yards from the group of cabins
I and 200 yards from Lorraine's cabin. It is
j only thirty- or forty feet from the sled
, road used In hauling wood out of the can
i yon. As Dier was â  strong man and Lor
j ralne weighed only about 135 pounds, It
would have been an easy feat for the sus
pect to carry "French Pete" to the place,
! or more easily to have dragged him there.
As Lorraine disappeared In the month
lof May. when the weather was very
i warm. the officials deem it a surprising
: fact that the odor of the decomposing
: flesh did not betray the presence of the
] body. This fact and others have on
vinced th<-m that Dler may have actually
â  committed the crime, but that he was not
the only person that knew of it. In 1888,
when John Johnson, a cook, disappeared,
EnoF himself was summoned before the
Grand Jury to make explanation* regard-
Ing certain suspicious circumstances.

as it i- believed that if he should be con
victed of the crime he might be able to
furnish the authorities with Information
concerning the previous tragedies which
have given the canyon the name of the
"Black Hole of Marln."
It is believed that Taylor and Eden now
have evidence tending to clear two of
these mysteries, which cannot be thorr
oughly elucidated without the knowledge
of facts Dier Is now supposed to have In
his possession. Knos lends color to this
theory by a persistent refusal to answer
all questions, saying that the Sheriff has
advised him to keep a still tongue.

DECKER ISLAND IS
AWARDED TO HANSEN
BUIBUN. Dec. 19.â The suit in ejectment
riled against Rom Hansen by Hugh Clns
sell was decided to-day by Judge Buck
les in favor of the defendant. The suit
Involved the possession of what Is known
as Decker Island In tho Sacramento
River.
The island has gradually been forming
' In the river since 1855. It is near the
west bauk. and the property on that side
is owned by Glassell, the plaintiff in the
case. Ho never took direct possession of
the Island, although he occasionally pas
tured some cattle on it and erected a few
wire fences. The island gradually in
creased In size until it finally reached
the western shore and became apparently
a portion of the plaintiff's property.
In is. the Island was surveyed and sold
to Hansen as swamp or overflowed land,
and for the last four or five rears he has
regularly employed men to improve it.
On April 10 ol this year Ghussell tiled an
ouster and the case was bitterly fought
In tho courts, with the result that the
decision was rendered in favor of the de
fendant. The Island now consists of about
seventy acres.

PROVING THAT ROBERTS
HAS A TRIO OF WIVES
Many Utah Witnesses Give Testi
mony Before the House Special
Committee,
WASHINGTON, Dec. '/' -A number of
from L'tafa appeared to-day be
the committee of the House of Rep
tlch is Investigating the
case of Polygamlflt Roberts. They includ
ed Mrs. Dr. Luella Miles, a pr;.
â¢ f Halt Lake City; Mrs Mâ¢
â¢ I. B. L. McDaniel and S. 1., i
Mr. R â¢
Wai present and conducted the ci
aminatlon.
.Mr.-. Dr. Miles was the first witness.
She gave her profession as that of a
physician at Salt Lake City and a member
of the Medical Society there. She gave
the details of a call she made at the house
of Mrs. Dr Maggie Bhlpp Huberts on
April 12, i>'j7. relative to some medical^
society affairs. Bhe addressed Mrs. Shlpp*
Roberts as "Dr. Shlpp." whereupon, the
witness saldt she waa interrupted, with the
remark:
â¢Doctor, you can call mo Dr. Roberts."
Mrs. Roberta went on to explain, the
witness said, that aha had been married
to Roberts for several years. She asked
that the medical society mail sent her In
future be add reaped, to "Dr. Huberts," sot
â¢'Dr. Shlpp."
Subsequently the witness called at the
house, and ;i:ter a time Roberts came In
and was introduced. She could not recall
whether there was a specific introduction
as husband or whether his entry was with
such familiarity aa to indicate a marital
status.
When Roberts cross-examined the wit
ness aha repeated ihe same story.
After the witness had stepped aside
Roberts submitted an objection to the ef
fect that thlÃ testimony related to lsl'7.
whereas the Committee had no Jurisdic
tion over him prior to bis becoming a
member of Congress.
"Then you contend," said Chairman
Taylor, "that the testimony should be
coniincd to polygamous practices subse
quent to Mai 1, VS&iT'
â¢'1 do," answered Roberts.
â¢â The objection will be noted," responded
the chairman,
Rev. S. K. Wishard was the next wit
ness, lie gave his business as that of
superintendent of the home missionary
work of the Presbyterian Synod, embrac
ing Utah. He knew Roberts and Mrs. Dr.
Roberts and related his nrst meeting with
the latter in September/ 1897. Tins oc
curred, be said, on the train at Mantl,
Utah. He "a:- in the car with Roberts
and spoke with him. A lady sat beside
him and he beckoned to her and then in
troduced her, saying:
"Mrs. Roberts, Mr. Wlshard."
On cross-examination Roberts brought
out \\ ishard opposition to. Mormonlsm
and then asked:
"Was Roberts drunk when he mado this
Introduction referred to?"
"Not that 1 know of."
"Was he insane?"

Kdward Mi Daniels, former manager of
the .- it Lake Ileruld. waÂ» examined at
considerable length, mainly on the politics
and convention alTalrs pertaining to Bob*
crts' nomination to Congress. In 1896,
while managing the Herald, he had .1 con
versation with Roberts, In the course of
which Roberts told him he had three fam
ilies. Subsequently, in 1898, the witness
said there was another conversation prior
to the nominating convention relative to
rumors against Roberts. Tin latter said
he thought this line of oppoMtion would
not prove effective, as be would court an
attack as to the plurality of wives.
On cross-examination McDanlels said he
hud ; posed the nomination of Roberts.

At thÂ»- afterno d session T. J. Brandon,
lent of Centerville, Utah, where be
had been Postmaster and Probate Judge,
tentifled that he had known B. n. R

Cella Dibble Roberts, lie kneV the <'hu
drÂ«-n ol Louisa Smith Robert] â five or six
, in number. Cella Dibble Roberts also had
lUdren. If he remembered correctly.
He knew thai on the morninp of August
ii 1897, it was currently reported about
i â¢ i.i. i \ llle thai B. ft. Rol
born to him by <v.iia Dibi.it>
Roberts. He had seen them frequently
. then. He als.. k.,\^ circumstantial
details of other children of Cella DlUble
Roberts, who. he Bald, u.>f" recognised In
the town as tin* children of B. H. Roberts
and called for the mal r i Blfa Roberta
and occasionally for B. il. Roberts while
the witness w aa P< â ( nuu
On cross-examination the witness said
he know nothing beyond general repute;
hail not been Introduced to Cells Roberts
'< and had never called at the house, He
said he had attended a town meeting and
made .i speech saying he would vote for
â¢ Roberta. as he was the "whitest" man of
the two sides. He bad voluntarily sepa
rated himself from the Mormon faith.
On redirect examination Brandon told
of â  funenU In the family of Cella Dib
ble Roberts. B. H. Roberts was present
at the funeral. Afterward he saw the
tombstone at the grave of this child,
which read:
"Lena, daughter of Celia and Brigham
H. Roberts."
In reply to Chairman Tayler Brandon
said Cella Dibble Roberta now occupied
the house formerly occupied by Louisa
Smith Roberts, who had moved into a
new house built by B. H. Roberts. i: H.
Roberts owned both buildings, according
to general repute. While Postmaster,
when one of tho Roberts children called
for mall for "father." lie delivered the
mail of B. H. Roberts.
Ray Brandon, son of the former witness
knew Roberts, Louisa Smith Roberts câ¢â¢
lia Dibble Roberts and most, if not ail, of
the children. He said it wan generally re
ported that the twins were born to Celia
and B. H. Roberta, and he had seen them
and talked with them. lie had seen
Roberts about the Cella Roberta house
just â¢'Â»Â» husband and father would be
about, working around the house and
barn. a short time ago, the witness said
he was passing the Leila Roberts houso
when one of Roberts' nieces presented the
twins and said they were the twins of B
11. Roberts. He had seen Roberts with
his coat off around the Cella Dibble house.
He was personally acquainted with the
11-year-old boy of Celia Dibble Roberts
and had talked with him as to the birth
of the twins. The children of Louisa
Roberta called Celia Dibble Roberta
â¢aunt." The usual Custom when such re
lations existed was for thn children of one
wife to call the other wife "aunt."
On cross-examination Roberts- brought
out that the witness was absent at school
for considerable periods. Including the
rammer of last year, and his observations
did not cover those periods. He had no
personal knowledge of the marital rela
tions existing beyond common repuio
When Roberts asked If the witness was
not a gambler he answered In the nega
tive. The witness. in response to ques
tions, said he had been lined twice for
minor assaults.
Bchroeder stated that this closed the
evidence on hand, and would be all unless
the committee wished for further testl
mony. There I ijfntleni^n

LIVES LOST IN
TENEMENT FIRES
Seven Charred Bodies
Taken Out.
Special Dispatch to Th* fall.
NEW YORK, Dec 19. Two early morn-
Ing tenement-house tires In this city re
sulted in the ueath of nt least seven per
sons to-day. The greater loss of life re
sulted from a tire In the Mentor apart
ment house, nt the corner of Third avenue
and One Hundred and Second street,
where five persona were burned to death
and nearly a dozen more or less seriously
injured through burns or .suffocation by
smoke. The dead persons are:
PATRICK BARRETT. H year* of nice.
MKS. PATRICK BARRETT, T. years of
age.
JULIA BARRETT, thHr si
datiKht.-r.
RICHARD NICKERB4 N
mechanic, of Cincinnati.
An unknown woman, about ~> years old
The Injured are: Delia O*ConnÂ» 2S;
Kate Farley, 25; Susan McAdee. Â£); Mary
Barrett. 9; Mamie Scary, Zi; Kate l'ar
rev, 26.
A few hours earlier a deadly ttre at
tacked the five-story tenement on Tenth
avenue, burning to death Mrs Martin
Fox and her child George, two years and
six months old. The charred remains of
both were found after the tire. Mr. Fox
is a hackman and was not at home.
The tire at One Hundred and Second
street and Third avenue la supposed to
have started In the cellar.
The building was occupied by a liquor
store on the first floor and on the upper
floors by families. When the tire was
discovered by â  man named Ward the
flames were coming out of the hallway.
The man could not enter the hallway, but
he ran Into the street and threw stones
at the building. There was no tire escape
in the front of the building. Presently
Ward saw at the fourth floor window n
Woman hanging on the ledge, the tire al
ready having Invaded her rooms. She
proved to i*Â» Delia OVonnell. Her sister
was also Climbing out Of the window and
she had already been severely burned and
half suffocated by smoke
Both women were hanging from â  the
window when a hook and ladder truck
came up. 'l be men at once put up scaling
and extern ladders and firemen
climbed up. At the fourth floor another
woman, Mi Susan McAdee. 00 years old.
was found partly burned and dazed by
pmoke. hanging out of a window. The
firemen tl^d a rope around Mis. McAdee
and let her safely down.
Three firemen caught the O'Connoll
women in their arms, not an Instant too
soon. Both were badly burned. By this
time many men and women were four.d
at the windows, having been driven out
of their rooms by the flame*.
A few of the people escaped by the roar,
where th â¢!â Â«â¢ were tire-escapes.
Hook and ladder Captain Turpenny
scaled a ladder to the top floor, and
found little Mary Barrett holding on to
the window ledge, a sheet of flame had
.struck her In the eyes and burned them
out. Her father, mother and little sister
were burned to death. The doctors *<ay
she cannot live.
May Seaxy was found at onÂ« of the
upper Boor windows crouching In a cor
ner, too suffocated by smoke and too
much burned to be able to help hrrselt.
The loss fin the building was $40,000.
The other (Ire, In Tenth avenue, near
Thirty-eighth street, started In the base
ment and drat floor hallway, and when it
was discovered It had such a headway
thfit It was Impossible to enter.
The families on the upper part of the
house fled to the roof, whence they easily
reached the street The flremen on going
through the house after the tire had been
subdued, found two bodies at the foot of
the stairs on the third floor. The peti
tions showed that the woman had been,
trying to carry her child up the stairs.
The damage to the building by the tire
was comparatively small. .

It Is fitting that San Jose should cele
brate the inauguration of statehood. Hero
the first State Capitol u.;i.- erected and
our first lawmakers met That those pio
neers acted wisely is evidenced by the
general prosperity the State has enjoyed
during its fifty years of statehood. The
celebration will be historical to an ex
tent, and the gathering of the old pio
neers will make it an epoch long to be
remembered. It will probably be the last
reunion of these argonauts and the na
tive sons and daughters. The features
of the parade will recall many of the early
scenes in the young life of the State.
The hospitality of the citizens of San
Jose is extended to all. and nothing will
be spared to make your visit pleasant.
The pioneers and native sons and daugh
ters â¢will keep open boose and receive you
with a glad hand.
Let us celebrate the past fifty years in
a royal manner and then start to work to
make the future half-century eclipse the
past. California Is yet In her swaddling
clothes. During the past two years oppor
tunities have come which were totally
unexpected. Our trade has extended
across the seas to Hawaii and the Philip
pine Islands, and California Is to be the
gateway of an Immense Western trade.
In the name of the citizens of San Jose
I again Invite you to come and participate
in our golden jubilee. A tine programme
of entertainment has been prepared, and
our citizens, aided by their wives and
daughters, the finest in the land, will bid
you welcome.
The past fifty years have. Indeed, been
golden ones for California. Yours In Joy
â¢ua welcome. C. J. MARTIN.

looking 10 the f-stal.lishm.-nt Â«t a Statt-
government In California. The convention
was made to consist of thirty-seven dele
gates, and met at Cotton Hall. in Mon
terey, on September 1. Only ten of the
thirty-seven delegates provided for in the
proclamation were found to be present
and an adjournment was taken for two
days. The convention, with all the dele
gates present, organized on September 4
by the election of Robert Semi as pres
ident and William G. Mai as secretary.*
A few Inquiries were made as to whether
any proposition for a Territorial govern
ment should be entertained, but as it was
apparent that a few delegates from the
extreme southern part of the country only
favored this form of government, the sub
ject was dropped and it was decided that
the convention should proceed to form a
State constitution. A committee was ap
pointed to report the plan of a State con
stitution for the action of the convention.
ADOPTION OF THE FIRST
CONSTITUTION.
On the day following Its appointment
the committee reported a declaration of
rights, constating of sixteen sections. As
soon as tho report was made the conven
tion resolved it If Into a committee of
the whole and discussed the report, sec
tion by section. On September 11 the
declaration, then consisting of. twenty -one
sections, was approved and reported back
to the convention. Then followed .days of
debate, terminating In the adoption of the
first constitution.
On September 26 the question of the lo
cation of the seat of State government
came up on the consideration of the re
port of the committee on miscellaneous
provisions of the constitution. That com
mittee reported the following:
u"T. h^ first J cession of the Legislature
shall be held in the Pueblo de San Joae
which place shall be the permanent seat
of government until removed by law
provided, however, that two-thirds of all
the members elected to each house of the

such a law."

Â» under General Rlley and a member of the
convention from Monterey, offered ihe
following as a substitute:
"The first fsslon of the Legislature un
der this constitution shall be held at Mon
terey, and the subsequent sessions at th*
permanent seat of government, whlrh
shall be the Pueblo de San Jose, unless
otherwise directed by a majority of nil
the members elected to each house of th*
Legislature." Â .â  -
SflN JOSE CHOSEN FOR
SEAT OF GOVERNMENT.
A lengthy debate followed, the delegates
from Monterey representing that they
were willing that the seat of government
should be changed to San Jose after tho
adjournment of the first Legislature. A
delegate from San Francisco moved to
amend tho substitute by striking out thÂ»Â»
word "Monterey" and Inserting "San
Francisco." This motion was lost, as was
also a motion to strike out all after "San
JoÂ«e" In thÂ»Â» substitute. The substitute
was then rejected by a vote of fifteen to
twenty-three, and the section providing
for the first session of the Legislature i<t
be held at San Jose was adopted, becom
ing a part of the State constitution. Tho
vote on this was twenty-three to four
teen. San Jose thus became the tint
State capital.
THE PRESENT STfJTE SEfJL
ADOPTED.
A committee had been appointed to re
ceive propositions and designs for a State
seal, but only one. that which Is In use
to-day, was offered and adopted. Robert
S. Garnet was the designer.
The convention devoted considerable
tin.-- to the discussion of various othT
matter*, and rinding Its labors about

with a request that he should forwnrd It
at the rarllest opportunity to the Presi

NATIVE HEMP TO
BE PLANTED ON
RYERS ISLAND
Three Hundred Acres
for a Start.
INDUSTRY THAT LOOKS WELL
OTHER PLANTATIONS LIKELY
TO BE MADE.
P. Ettlinger and J. H. Thomas of this
city are about to engage In the culture of
hemp on v large scale upon Ryers Island,
In Solano County, opposite Rio Vista.
A tract of 300 acres has been prepared for
seeding and Mr. Ettlinger is looking for
the necessary Hefd. Thin he will probably
procuro in Gridley, Uutte County, where
hemp has been grown for a number of
years. Mr. Ettlinger made tho facts
known yesterday and also talked about
tho prospect for cultivating California
hemp. Ho said that he had been in Grid
ley and had Men the hemp growing some
time ago. Ho had been informed that the
misers of hemp in Butto County were
rolling their product In the raw state to
Eastern people and that they were able
to sell all that they -.<!. This fact
made him of the opinion that the hemp
was of a good commercial quality. ills
first planting will be experimental, so far
as the commercial aspect of the case Is
concerned.
There was no question that hemp would
grow, he bald, in almost any part ol the
State where there Is bottom land. The
*otl at Gridley In of that sort. Such also,
is the soil at Ryers Island. Some hemp
ha* tÂ»Â«:i grown by Mr. ESttllnger and the
product, having been exhibited, was de
clared to be equal to anything raised in
Rutte County. This additional fact has
led Mr. Ettlinger to think that the
chances of failure are very small.
One question was whether the. manufac
turers of California hemp could compete
in prico with those of the East. Accord
ing to advices the machinery to work up
the. fiber was not very complicated. Cali
fornia hemp had recently bÂ«on made into
twine, bags, portieres and even a suit of
clothes. The last-named manufacture
was worn away out of the State by W. J
J. Cunningham of S,U~m. Ore., who ex
perimented with the Jute machinery at
an Quentin Prison to see what he could
do with the home-grown hemp and also
with home-grown flax. Mr. Cunningham's '
conclusion was. after experimenting, that
there was nothing the matter with either
California hemn or California flax. In
deed, he pronounced the hemp superior to
the hemp of Oregon, and mid that there
whs no better grown anywhere. Mr. Cun
ningham was an expert and what he had
said was mother reason for confidence.
Cunningham came down from Oregon at
the request of Mr. Heaney of Qiidley to
manage the hemp plantation on 11 "army's
ranch.

THE SAN FB AN CISCO CALL, , WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 20. 1899.
POLICE OFFICER DINAN
SEES A CHINESE GHOST
' f =^ ARLT yesterday morning Pa-
EARLY yesterday morning Pa
trolman \V. K. I>inan saw a
I f real, live ghost in Chinatown.
It was that of Gee Hop Sing; a
Chinese shrimp-picker. Perched on the
shoulders of Sup Gee. It was out in its
winding sheet for a last airing before
molting Its mortal casing. It was 2
o'clock Olid through the dark alleys of
Chinatown the wintry wind As whist
ling dolefully. Mournful clouds were
drifting over the face of the storm
ringed moon and the chill of the tomb
was in the air. The ghost of Gee Hop
Sing would not have been respectable
had It not shivered. It did, and so vio
lently that the policeman Immediately
came to the conclusion that animated
burglar tools were being paraded on
his beat.
ThÂ»Â» ghost of Gee Hop first dawned
on the vision of Dtnan as that limb . f
the white man's law was exercising
himself on Washington street, near
Stockton. All was so still that even
Sergeant Thomas Samuel Duke might
have heard a hundred players draw-
Ing corks In' a certain Jackson-street
lottery. Not a soul was In sight.
Chinatown appeared to bo "hitting the
pillow."
Suddenly out from one of the low
doorways on Washington street Issued
the figure of a man staggering under a
burden. Dlnan became all eyes. Tip
toeing after, he made out through the
fog a shorted something astride, the
shoulders of the hurrying quarry.
The sheeted something was the
ghost of Gee Hop Sing, still clinging
to the consumption-wasted frame of
the shrimp-picker. The damps of death
were fast freezing it off the earth.
For day* the friends of Gee Hop ha.l
gathered around his bedside, shaking
their heads and going through panto
mime indicative of their belief that
their consumptive comrade was due to
cast his nets In the shrlmp-plcklng
grounds en the beautiful shore. They
kept vigil unerasing until the . fatal
hour arrived, when they dispatched a
messenger for Ah Goon, the under
taker of their tong.
It is ono of the superstitions of
Cunningham wished to ace what could be
done. He first applied to parties In Oak
land to give him a chance to experi
ment In manufacturing. He was not suc
cessful In enllstlnpr co-operation In Oak
land and ho then made application to the
State Board of Trade, asking that lnllu
encÂ© mlcht be exerted to have th* Juto
machinery at the San Quentln Prison put
to work on five bales of California hÂ«Â»mp
and four bales of California flax. This
brought about the desired trial and about
one and one-half tons of raw material was
worked up.
Messrs. Ettllnr^r and Thomas will look
about for machinery. There Is some In
I this city that might possibly bo used.
! Mr. Ettllnger said that he had not yet
! seen It. He and his associates would plant
! In June. The crop will ripen In August.
The State annually imports about 800
tons of hemp twine. Fully 300 tons go Into
the Bewing of bags for California prod
ucts. California Is probably the. largest
consumer of twine of any State In the
Union. The railroad rates upon the raw
product, eoHtbound. and upon the twine
manufactured In the East, westbound,
may afford sufficient protection to make
the homo enterprise of manufacturing
California twine out of California hemp
profitable. The sane also applies to flax.
Useful Christmas Presents.
Traveling sots, valises, bags, pocket- I
"books, bill books and card cases are Die â¢
presents for either lady or gentleman.

JAMES J. FLYNN IS
CALLED BY DEATH
BY PNI-UMOMA EARLY YESTKRD.W MORNING.
JAMES J. KI.YNN, ex-County Clork. ex-Assemblyman and a -well known
figure for twenty years past In local politics, died early yesterday morn
ing of pneumonia at the home of his parents at 3927 Twenty-fifth street.
Death came unexpectedly. Mr. Flynn was taken ill on Saturday night
last with a severe cold, which developed rapidly Into pneumonia, although
not of a serious type. On the night of his death he appeared to be resting
easily up to within a few minutes of his demise, when he began to sink rap-
Idly and pawed away without pain. All of the members of his family were at
his bedside.
Mr. Flynn began his political career In the late seventies. He was a stu
dent of Denis Kearney and rose rapidly In. popular favor. It was he who
saved Charles do Young from a possible lynching at the time of the Kalloch-
De Young troubles in this city. In ISSO he occupied the post of chief deputy
under Sheriff Desmond, and in ISS2 was elected to the Assembly, in which
body he served two. terms. In !M5 he was elected County Clerk by a large
majority over Louis N. Jacobs, and before the expiration of his term was be
lag prominently mentioned for Congress. At that time he was the protege of
James V. Coleman and other millionaires of the day and was very popular.
Since then he has acted as chief deputy under Assessor Nealon and as pur
chasing agent of the Board of Harbor Commissioners and has filled numer
ous other positions of trust with high credit to himself. ,
Mr. Flynn leaves one daughter, his parents and live married sisters. He
was a charter member of Stanford Parlor, N. S. G. W.. and a member of the
Iroquois Club and the Order of Eagles. raKM
Chinatown that it Is bad luck to have
a death in a dwelling house. To ob
viate such visitations "Chambers of
Tranquillity" were added to the Mon
golian undertaking establishments. To
such "Chambers of Tranquillity" the
dying are borne to yield the ghost.
Following out the custom. Ah Goon
dispatched Sup Gee to bring the rapid
ly dying Gee Hop to his Chamber of
Tranquillity. Sup Gee, who is an ex
pressman, did not feel like hitching up
his horse at that hour of the morning,
and on tlndlng that the frame of Gee
Hop had wasted to skin and bone, re
solved to carry the dying man on h : 8
shoulders. He wrapped the body In a
sheet and was on his wav to An
Goon's Chamber of Tranquillity when
spied by Dlnan.
The policeman followed stealthily
after Sup Gee and his burden, tiptoe
ing down to Dupont street, out Dupont
to Pacific and around the corner 10
741 Pacific. where Ah Goon's shop Is
located. Entering almost "immediately
after his man. lie found Sup Gee and
the sleepy Ah Goon bending over the
body. Under the circumstajices Dlnan
had every reason to believe a foul
crime had been committed, and he
made an examination." which, while It
convinced him that Gee Hop was dead,
failed to reveal any marks of murder'
Concluding, nevertheless, that It was
a case worthy of deeper Inquiry, ha
arrested Sup Gee and Ah Goon, charg
ing the one with removing a corpHa
without a permit, the other with re
ceiving -he same without a ditto.
Before Police Judge Graham yester
day the Chinese complicated matters
by testifying that Gee Hop was not
a corpse when ho was removed and
that he breathed his last only after
DARING THIEF IS
CAPTURED BY POLICE
William Brooks Taken Into Custody
After Assaulting His
Pursuer.
William Brooks, a young thief well
known to the police, was arrested last
nlpht by Policeman Sam Roy-ton and
charged at the City Prison with petty
larceny and battery. The prisoner and an
accomplice made a daring attempt to rob
Michalltschke'B cigar store at 410 Market
street, but were frustrated by a bystander
named F. W. Walraven, who Jives at thÂ©
Winchester House.
Brooks' accomplice entered the cigar
store and engaged the clerk In conversa
tion. Brooks then slipped in and grabbed
up a heavy tin of tobacco and ran up the
street. Walraven saw the action and pur
sued the thief, who. seeing himself pur
sued, waited for Walraven, and as the lat
ter attempted to grab him Brooks struck
him in th* face, knocking him to the side
walk. The thief was about to continue
his ilight when Royston grabbed him and
took him Into custody. The accomplice
escaped during the excitement.
George W. Carter Dead.
BAKERSFIELD, Dec 19.â Oorge W.
Carter. Marshal of Kern City, died to-day,
after a brief Illness. He was one of the
oldest engineers on the Southern Pacific
I system.
he had been received into Ah Ooon's
Chamber of Tranquillity. As that con
dition would have knoc ked the police
man's cases higher than ;i cocked hat,
the court asked him concerning: the
condition of Gee Hop when he exam
ined the body.
"He wat as dead as a mackerel.
your Honor," sai4 Dinan.
"That settles it." repllpd Judsre Gra

And so another ghost was laid, pe
culiar only in this that, true to the
Chinese bjrstem of contrariness, :t

no better than walk.

fit the necessity. The sume is true us con
cerns the dock at Mare Island. Senator
Perkins has already introduced a bill to
have a stone dock substituted for the pro
posed timber structure. The Pennsylva
nia's have had experience with a timber
dock and know whereof they speak. A
timber dock was constructed at League
Island in IBU. In eight years the repair*
on that structure have cost f7MKOL This
is at the rate of over |MM) per annum.
This object lesson has had its lull ef
lect. The Pennsylvania delegation in
Congress is unanimously in favor of *
stone dock, The newspapers of Pennsyl
vania are strongly advocating stone, At
tention has been called to i.i>- tact that
the drydccKs to be constructed at Boston
and at Portsmouth will be of masonry,
'i hero are aetalls concerning the timber
cocks at fseveial navy yarus that rein
' â â â  the observations 01 the Pennsylva
nlam concerning the durability 01 wood,
borne of theiie are to bo touna in the re
port of Hoar Admiral Bndicott, chief of
uocks and wnarves, and some are derived
from other ofitcial sources.
Six stone docks in a period of 179 years
have cost J'.'iis â Â«, for repairs, while seven
Umber docks In a period of thirty years
have absorbed the considerable sum of
$4Â£!,:!42 O*J. The average cost of a stone
docK for repairs per annum Is 537. The
cost of a timber dock's repairs is over
$12,000 per annum. Figures are furnished
In detail for Instruction and for verifica
tion as follows: The masonry dock at
Boston was built in 1833. It has cost
13821 IT in sixty-six years, an average an
nual cost of less than $.'iS. The masonry
dock at Norfolk was built in 1534 and has
cost for repairs in sixty-five years the
sum of $9SI '.'â .', or less than $14 per annum.
The masonry dock at the Brooklyn Navy
Yard was built in I>.M and has cost $1815
for repairs in forty-eight years, or less
than &iS per annum.
The timber docks have made a differ
ent showing. The first was built at Nor
folk in 1889 and has cost for repairs $53,
043 34, or over ISSN per annum. Then
come the two timber docks built at the
Brooklyn Navy Yard in 1890. Inside of
ten years they have cost $302,342 14. That
Is at the rate of more than $16,800 a year
for repairs.
The reasons set forth by the Chamber
of Commerce and the Board of Trade of
San Francisco for urging the California
Congressional delegation to work for th*
â tone docks are epitomized below, for
they present the general considerations In
the matter completely: "Concrete and
stone are superior to wood for strength,
durability, safety and cost of mainte
nance. Changed relations with the great
countries lying on the west coast of the
Pacific will make the Mare Island dock
one of the most Important in the United
States. The Pacific Coast of the United
States should have every facility with
which to encourage, protect and foster
trade. The docks, equipment and plant
provided for the construction and main
tenance of our navy should be of the most
enduring and substantial and complete
character, to be in accord with the com
mercial importance of this coast."

FENNELL ESTATE MYSTERY
â¦ â
LETTERS OF ADMINISTRATION
HAVE BEEN GRANTED.
"While the candles flickered and dripped I
quarrymen wrenched the underpinning
from beneath the cottago of the late Mrs.
Winifred Finn. 11, 411 Fair Oaks street.
on Monday night in a vain search for a
last will and testament heirs allege she
left directing the disposition of her prop
erty. Monday afternoon A. Ruef, attor
ney for the J'ublli; Administrator, entered
Judge CoffejT*! court on business. Judge
Coftey was engaged in an attempt to ef
fect a compromise of the various claims
of relatives of Mrs. Fennell, who claim
that the decedent's husband, William
1- â¢â¢nil' 11, has made away with the will, but
on observing Mr. Ruef the- court said
that in his opinion It would bo a good idea
to appoint the Public Administrator spe
cial administrator of the estate during
tho pendency of the present litigation.
Mr. Ruef promptly accepted the offer and
conferred with counsel representing the
various claimants with the result that an
order as made appointing the Public ;
Administrator special administrator of
the estate, notwithstanding the surprise
of Judge Coffey, occasioned by the fact
that his "spark of humor had been quick
ly fanned to a living flame by Mr. Ruef."
Immediately following the completion of |
the order appointing the Public Adminis
trator, Mr. Ruef, after considering the
allegations made by Mrs. Elliott, a sister
of the deceased, that a will was in exist
ence, Invited all interested parties to ac
company him In an inspection of the
premises lately occupied by the deceased
for the purpose of discovering the will if
one existed. Emil Pohli. who represents
Mr. Pennell: Attorney Shelton, counsel
for Mrs. Elliott. Mr. Ruef and all of the
claimants met shortly after 5 o'clock Mon
day evening and proceeded to the Fen-
Dell residence. All of the attorneys, on
arriving at the premise?. Immediately be
gan the search, the curiosity of the ladles
in the crowd being thoroughly gratified
as they delved Into trunks, valises and
wardrobes.
As the will was not forthcoming Mr.
Elliott, husband of decedent's sister, who
claims that she was named as a devisee
in the missing will, insisted. that the base
ment of the house be searched for the
document. As the "basement" is about
three feet from ground to roof, candles
were procured, as well as picks, shove's
and dirt removers. Mr. Elliott and a
lrlend, whom he addressed as "Pat."
crawled under the basement, and. closely
followed by Mr. Ruef, began Investiga
tions. "Pat" finally convinced himself
that he had found the burial place of the
missing document, and after obtaining
Elliott's concurrence began to sink on the
prospect. An occasional fragment of pa
per added to the excitement of the inves
tigation, and every spur, dip and angle
was closely followed by the excavators.
After they had worked out this hole both '
wlelders of the pick discovered that they
were wringing with perspiration, and Mr.
Ruef discovered that he was the vlctlnr. of
a cramp, the result of long confinement
In the three-foot basement.
Mr. Ruff withdrew and Mr Pohll took
his place as guardsman. Elliott and "Pat"
had calculated by this lime that the will
was burled over in another corner. Both
wormed their way to said corner, again
opened excavations and. although the
house showed signs of collapsing for lack ,
of underpinning. they kept up their
work. After having laid out trenches of
sufficient magnitude to hold a division â¢â ( !
the Boer army Elliott and "Pat" retired
from the basement and after a vigorous
consultation decided that the will was In
the woodshed. Consequently the con-
nts of the woodshed were carried to the
exterior, but investigation failed to pro
duce the document.
Then Mr. Elliott decided that as Mrs.
Fennell has many favorite flowers it wns
very likely that she had wrapped the doc
ument In oilcloth and deposited it at the- i
roots of some favorite. As it was 8 o'clock
at night by this time and the candles had \
dwindled low. Mr. Ruef refused to re
main longer and for the time the search
was called off. Yesterday morning, how
ever, an attache of the Public Adminis
trator's office visited the KÂ«nnÂ«Â»ii home
stead and with the assistance of counsel
plowed up the front yard and uprooted the
Bowers, but the will Is still missing. This
fact will be reported to me court a*. Ihe
next hearing. In the meantime, however,
the Public Administrator will labor be
neath the authority conferred by sp?Â«:i:il
letters of administration upon the estate
of tho <!>â¢â¢. a-. and, as there Is nothing
left to excavate, excavations beneath thÂ«
decedent's former home will doubtless be
abandoned and the will numbered among
the mysterious disappears

A SPECULATORS 1 PfINIC.
SEVERAL months ago there was a mad rush to
buy the many trust stocks th* were listed in
Wall street.
Politicians were furiously denouncing the trusts,
while the speculative spirit of the people was tempt
ing them into existence by eagerly taking their
stocks. At that time The Call treated the multiplica
tion of trusts as a result of speculation rather than
i as a permanent change in the industrial methods of
the country- Admitting that the survival of some out
of the many trusts so suddenly created would follow,
still that would mean the permanence of such as had
genuine commercial utility. In that discussion of the
subject we said also that the general rush for trust
stocks, being speculative, was one of the conditions
which implied a money panic and a shrinkage of
speculative values which would affect those which
were non-speculative. This forecast was justified
when the market had to be relieved by the offer of
the treasury to redeem $25,000,000 in Government
bonds, and again by the failures and panic of Monday
in New York.
There is no denying that the spirit of speculative
gambling in this country has been cultivated by the
practice of applying to the Federal treasury for help.
Those who gamble for a living are more reckless
when they feel that the treasury can be depended upon
to sustain gambling values and to ease, the pains of
liquidation by pouring out money in emergencies.
This feeling was the basis of Black Friday, and has
been in every speculative panic experienced since the
fiscal policy of the country underwent the change of
1862.
Financiers have seen clearly that this process has
always entangled the public and private credit of the
country. To some the reasons for Federal relief have
seemed good, because actual values and speculative
valna are not discriminated between when a panic
comes on. Gambling has been ambushed behind le
gitimate business, which it can earn- down with it.
and the Government has rallied to save legitimate
business from destruction.
It is worth noting that the financial legislation
which passed the House on Monday is the begin
ning of the extrication of the public credit from its
I artnership with the private credit of the cour.try.
-oration c.-r. no longer resort to the
treasury for protection there will be leÂ«s of it. When
the treasury can protect itself against depletion of its
pold reserve that reserve may be less in volume, and
such amount as is release ! mil enter into circulation
to serve the financial needs of the country. Without
s as the House bill provides every
speculative panic proceeds to tap the treasury: the
endless chain is put in motion; greenbacks flow int >
the treasury and gold flows out: and the greenbacks.
â¢ 'lately reissued, immediately return, demanding
more gold, until to save the public credit bonds have
to be sold to pet more gold to supply the endless
drain. This amazing scheme is ended by the new
law. When gold is paid out for greenbacks they
stand canceled to all uses except reissue for gold
again. The speculator's permission to eat his cake
and keep it is ended. All men who know the de
sirability ol "g public from private credit will
hail the reform.
When this bill is the law panics may still come.
No financial system, no standard of value, has ever
ented them, and none ever will. Until the lottery
eculation is on such a basis that the holder ol
every ticket gets a prize larger than the ticket cost
these panics will occur, and that means they will rl
ua.vs :t hereafter the holders of blanks can
not demand that the Government cash them.
The ::ts of unsound money are already in
the field citing Mnvdiy's liquidation as an effect of
the Ho-.i<e bill. But these same prophets ceaselessly
law about the crime of 1873, and paint in rosy
â¢ -he conditions that were upon the country be
â  I demonetizing nf silver. They forget
the panic ,_ j n proportion to
the volume of business then existing to be affi
-m. were as destructive aa the two panics that
have occurred since 1R73.
It may as well be made known that the sound
>â¢ sentiment r >f the country pi Â«o co for
â¢ :pliÂ«hment nf c though
every speculative trust si n Wall street go
the barber-shopi for shaving-pr-.per and though the
I who shriek against trusts stand on the
en crying out against sound money measures as
the cause of the downfall of the trusts which they
have just denot:
â¢Ed States Senator Quay is authority for the
admission that he is willing to be denounced as
everything his enemies choose to call him, with one
exception. He still retains self-respect enough to
deny with vehemence that he is an associate of Dan
Burns.
OUR MUNICIPAL ISSUES
GRATIFYING indeed are the evidences of
ilar interest in the approaching bond elec
tions. Xo good citizen should permit the
rush of holiday business or pleasure to distract his
mind from these issues. The welfare of the city is
involved in them, and if the vote requisite to assure
progress and improvement be cast on election day we
can look forward to beginning a new year of mu
nicipal development unparalleled in our annals.
There have been many objections urged against
the various improvements proposed, but they have
not been of a kind to affect the opinions of men who
are desirous of making a larger, a better, a healthier
and a more beautiful San Francisco. They have ap
pealed mainly to those who do not distinguish be
tween economy and parsimony, or perceive that a
community which does not advance must retrograde.
To the progressive elements of our population the
objections have amounted to no more than the usual
Silurian protest against progress of any kind.
To the objections first made that the improvements
would cost too much ample refutation was given by
elaborate calculations showing that the cost would
be comparatively slight and would not materially in
rrr * c the burdens of taxation. To the second ob
jection that the grade of the extension of the pan
handle would require cuts so deep as to destroy the
value of property answer was made by expert demon
stration that an easy roadway can be provided with
out entailing either a deep cut or a heavy expense.
So it has been with all other objections. They have
been refuted one after another by facts and figures
of undoubted accuracy.
It would be indeed a sad blow to the city if the
opportunity for improvement now so promising were
lost either throwph the objections of unprogressive
people or through the indifference of the business
men and taxpayers generally. Other large cities are
expending, or have expended, vast sums of money in
providing parks for their people. If San Francisco
do not provide an adequate park system now she wiM
have to do so later on at an increased cost. Every
year of dehy will add to the amount of expenditure.
Prompt action in this respect is economy.
It is to be remembered that these improvements
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, in A KM HER *J(), 189Â».
made by the public will prompt to other improve
ments through the gifts of liberal millionaires. As
was well said by D. V. Kelly in a communication to
the Merchants* Association Review: "Vote for the park
bonds also because ail such expenditures educate and
encourage civic pride. Can any man say that Sharon
would have donated a playground, Crocker built a
conservatory. Huntington a Stow lake, Spreckels a
majestic music-stand and Sweeney an observatory, if
our citizens had not provided a Golden Gate Park
that suggested these public-spirited gifts? Would we
have a museum if we had no park?"
Such questions carry their answers with them. In
fact, every well-founded consideration of the matter
tends to the conclusion that the purposed park im
provement should be provided. It is as necessary as
the schools, the hospital or the sewers. Let every
voter of true citizenship bear the issue in mind and
work for the cause of progress and improvement.
The Call would suggest to the members of the Uni
vrrsity of California football team that in preparation
for their meeting with the Carlisle Indians they shaw
their heads. Their presence on the gridiron with the
chrysanthemum mops of hair now in fashion will be
nothing less than a flying in the face of Providence
and an invitation to the red men to take their scalps.
TELEPHONE COMPANIES OND ThjE
PUBLIC.
BY the passage of the resolutions imposing a
license tax upon nicke!-in-the-slot telcphon?
machines, and providing that the desired
switch shall be made for the patron before the nickel
can be demanded from him, the Superiors undoubt
edly surprised the telephone magnates. They have s<<
defied the public they had reached the conclu
sion that nothing would ever be attempted to limit
their extortions. They thought they could g;t the
resolutions postponed and put off until the present
Hoard of Supervisors went out of office. They sup
posed that by free wires to back yards or other such
means it would be possible to control a majority of
the Supervisors and have the resolutions either
shelved or defeated. Hence the passage of the resolu
tions was a surprise that pains them in their tenderest
sensibilities.
It is not improbable they will have another sur
prise when the Legislature meets. It is well known
through the clever manipulations of the astute
Mr. Pillsbury, attorney for the corporation, there was
sneaked into the new charter a provision which debars
the Board of Supervisors from regulating telephone
rates. Feeling secure in the advantage obtained by
that trick, the telephone managers have forgotten the
existence of the State Legislature, or have overlooked
the fact that it has power to regulate rates. When
r-.ext the Legislature meets its attention will be di
rected to the extortions of the company, and it is then
that another surprise will agitate the nerves of the
telephone managers, accustomed as they are to jar
ring of the "buzzers" they employ for the torment of
the public.
There is ample justification for a governmental re
duction of the telephone charges now imposed upon
the public. It is true that before the Supervisors, anj
generally when talking where the public can hear,
Secretary Eaton asserts the poverty of the telephone
corporations and complains that the wages of girls
are so high and the cost of wire so excessive there
are no profits in the business. The Call, however, has
information 'that this self-same Secretary Eaton not
long ago urged friends to purchase stock in the tele
phone company, and in the course of his urging
stated that to his knowledge the earnings of the tw I
companies average $250,000 a month, and that 40 per
cent of the sum is clear profit.
When Secretary Ka: >n talks of the small income of
the telephone compary he is talking buncombe, but
when he talked to the friend whom he wished to hav
invest in telephone stock he was talking business.
These and other fact= equally pertinent to the issue
can be shown to the satisfaction of the Legislature,
and in the end it will be found that while the com
pany has profited much by the adroit sen-ice of Mr.
Pfllsbnry in fixing the charter it has not completely
escaped from the supervision of law.
A local preacher has arrived at the conclusion that
man, considered from every point of view that may
be suggested by his necessities, has no need for hell.
That preacher must have heen studying the signs of
the times or reading the reports of the war in South
Africa.
SOME information of a nature sufficiently novel
to be interesting anj probably valuable has
been made pubiic by a suit recently brought
before the United States Circuit Court sitting in
Boston for the purpose of recovering $3710 for an
alleged breach of contract relative to the employment
by one of the theaters in that city of eight girls
technically described as "mascots."
The plaintiffs in the ca<e rue members of a firm in
London whose business v that of supplying chorus
girls to any theater that wishes them. In an account
given of the case by a special correspondent of the
New York Times it is stated the company collects
girls and trains them for the stage. They are taught
, dancing and singing, and as soon as they are con
sidered competent to perform the duties required of
them the company secures engagements for them, in
[ dividually or in groups, in theaters all over the world.
Hundreds of theaters are said to be thus supplied.
I The girls are in a state of virtual servitude, subject to
' the will of their masters, and compelled to go wher
ever they send them. When employment is obtained
for them a large percentage of their salaries goes to
the masters, and is paid directly to them by the per
! son who contracts for the girls' services. The ar
rangement is one sanctioned and protected by law,
and care is taken to accept only such pupils as are
: either by themselves or their guardians competent to
make contracts for the sale of their sen-ices.
Now that is as nice a trade as ever was, and it is
not easy to understand why there has not been a trust
or at least a stock company organized to handle it.
It would be a pleasing variation in the stock exchange
list to have quotations of chorus girls from fair to
middling in assorted lots. Such stocks would be al
ways lively and moving, with an upward tendency
generally, but of course a great slump when the frost
is on the stage and the angels cease to sing.
To the uninitiated the trade will appear very much
like a traffic in coolies, or at least as an importation of
contract labor, but then the uninitiated must not
trust to appearances where chorus girls are con
cerned. They come to us by contract, it is true, but
they come as artists to elevate and refine us. and not
as laborers to work us. All the same the suit of'
the London firm was dismissed from the United
States court on the ground of a lack of jurisdiction,
and there seems to be no appeal to a Police Court, so
the chances of the plaintiffs getting their money, pro
vided any be due them, b slight. All of which goes
to show it is not always safe to trust even to mascots
when dealing with Boston people.

At several little meetings which have
been held lately it has been pointed out
I hat neither of the ladles indorsed by the
Alumnae Association has ever had ex

she wes receiving her own education. It
was argued that as teachers their work
had been In the higher branches and they
had never been brought In close touch
with the children arid their needs. As a

up. anu nis cnances with the Mayor are
couMdered so slim that hi- Is no longer
figured on as a fnctor in the question.
Speculation regarding the Board of
Health hns been revived by the general
report that Dr. Thomas Shumate and Di
Pnul Cox would be called upon by the
Mayor to assist Drs. Williamson and
Bazet In that body. Both are well known
and their appointment would give gtnural
satisfaction both within the fraternity
and without.
The Incoming Supervisors are inclined to
turn over to the Mayor the formation and
appointment of their numerous eommlt
te<s. A caucus at which that question
wl!l be discussed will be held on the 281
inst.. and It Is likely that his Honor will
have the naming of everything save the
chairmanship of the Finance Committee
and the half dozen clerks allowed the
board by the charter. The report has been
circulated that John Russell will soon he
well enough to again take up his duties,
and If It proves true the new board will
tender him hi 3 old position as chief clerk.
If It does not. In all probability that posi
tion will fall to John Kyan. the present
claims clerk. Harry Farquharson Is mak
ing a hard (Urhi for the nlace. but the wlsÂ«
ores say he has not a dead man's chance.
The bond elections are at present taking
all of the time of the Mayor and the Elec
tion Commissioners, ar.d It Is not expected
that his Honor will announce any ap
pointments until after the "h of the

Potrero Club for Progress.
A large nnd enthusiastic meeting of the
residents and property owners of the
westf m slope of Potrero Heights was held
at Reilly's Hall. Rhode Island street, last
night. J. Bardhun, prerldont of the club.
was In the chair. Th- comfortable little
hall was packed to the door by men who
take an active interest In the progress of
the city's growth, as also of their own
section. An example of this interest was
brought forth at the meeting when Attor
ney C. F. Kimball. speaking for the ex
ecutive committee, who waited on the
Market stre. t magnates of the railroad
company, reported that the railroad
authorities more than met the delegates
half-way by sending a ganÂ»r of men to
Bet the conducting electric poles on the
street as rÂ»MiUÂ«stt*d by thÂ« club represen
tatives. The same delegates had called on
Mayor Phelan. requesting his aid at such
time as the franchise comes before him
for his approval. To this he assured them
that he was In favor of the measure and
would support It.
For this kindness he received a vote of
thanks and a promise from the delegates
that the club would unconditionally sup
port the entire l>ond issue.
The Hub elected J. liuodt. A. V. Craig
and Frederick Kimball ns delegates to the
Mission Federation of Improvement Clubs.
Short and breezy sj^eches were made by
Attorney C. F. Kimball, President Bard

and others on the duties of every citizen
to vote for and work In the Interest of the

As the time approaches for the bond
elections the progressive element declares
that its fight !s won. and that all the
bonds will secure far more than the nec
essary two-thirds vote. The doubt that
mlÃht have existed a few weeks ago In
resard to the panhandle extension ap
pears to have entirely vanished, and
Mayor Phelaa has stated that even the
organized strength of the opposition will
avail nothing on either December 27 or 29.
One of the surprises of the dosing days
of the campaign is the mark. -d enthusiasm
that is being shown In the extremities of
the city by the improvement clubs. At
North Beach and Bunnyslde. In the West
ern Addition and at the Potrero and South
San Francisco, in the Mission and In Noe
Valley, there is but one sentiment, and all
are working energetically to lay the foun
dntlon for a more progressive city.
The Democratic Central Club will hold
a special meeting to-night at Pythian
Hall for the discussion of the bond is
sues. Mayor Phelan will address the
members on the necessity of Improve
ments. Charles H. Holcomb, by maps and
diagrams, will show what the park exten
sion will look like when completed and
will speak on the necessity of a new sewer
system.
BUILDERS FAVOR PANHANDLE
The Exchange Adopts Resolutions
Indorsing Proposed Im
provements.
Resolutions favoring the panhandle ex
tension and the construction of a new
sewer system were adopted yesterday at
a meeting of the members of the Builders'
Exchange held at the headquarters, 4"
New Montgomery street. Mayor Phelan
was the only speaker. He was Introduced
by President S. H. Kent .if the Exchange,
who presided over the gathering. The
Mayor wns warmly received by the gen
tlemen representing the building trades of
the city. He said that the need of bonds
for a sewer system, new sehoolhou?es and
hospitals was admitted on all sides, but
that there was some opposition to the
panhandle extension. This he said came
from a body of men who were relics of
the pant, who came to this city originally
expecting to make their fortunes here and
then return to their homes In the Bast,
and who never favored Improvements that
would cost anything. The Mayor argued
that everything that In the least degree
benefited the city would naturally benefit
those engaged In the building trades
At the conclusion of the address Bupor
vlsor-elect L. J. Dwyer presented resolu
tions Indorsing the Improvements advo
cated by Mr. Phelan. The resolutions re
ceived the unanimous support of the
members of the Exchange and were
adopted with considerable enthusiasm.
Similar action was also taken by the
Builders' Association at a meeting held
at the headquarters on Bush street, which
was addressed by the Mayor and Jere
miah Mahoney.

Point Ix)bos Improvement Club has it*
way about the matter. An enthusiastic
meeting of the club was held last evening
at Richmond Hall, during which the bond
project was discussed in all its phases
President George R. Fletcher said th.iÂ»
there was but one side to the question!
and that was favorable to it. Memben. of
the club art- very much chagrined at the
action of the Richmond Improvement

mISS ANNA M FIEDLER,
who as Edith Hall compelled
the admiration of Tlvoll
audiences for several sea

Supervisor-elect William N. McCar

made of the approaching nuptials,
although the wedding has been
expected for many weeks. Both
bride and groom were anxious for thÂ«j
quietest of ceremonies, and not until
a few days ago did they decide thai
the marriage should take place yes
terday.

Mission Heartily Favors Parks.
Residents of the lOaalon give no Indica
tion Of the opposition that is said to exist
against the panhandle extension in their
locality. Under the auspices of the West
of Castro Street Improvement Club a
rousing meeting was held at Duveneck
Hall last night, and for over two hours
the audience showed its entire sympathy
with the practical speeches made In favor
of the Issuance of bonds fur needed public
Improvements. .
f. W. Qunlman. president of the club,
acted as chairman, and in a few words
expressed his conviction that on Wednes
day of Christmas week San Francisco
would decide that it must arouse and take
on a new lea! â¢ of better life than it has
hitherto experienced.
Judge Cooney, In referring to the com
mendable work of the late Frank McOop
nln In helping to acquire Golden Gate
Park, paid that a monument to his mem
ory should be erected at the Van Ness en
trance to the new panhandle.
"There was live times the opposition to
the purchase of Golden Gate Park there
is to-day to the extension of the pan
handle." said he, "but we know how "veil
those early promoter! saw the necessities
of the day In which we are living, If you
think there Is no need to make this .it >â 
more attractive, go to the ferries at the
close of business on any day of the week
and you will <Â»â¢<â  thousands of people leav
ing Ban Francisco and going to their
homes. And where an- their homes? In
Ban Rafael, Oakland. Alameda, Berkeley
and San llateo. ah these people should
live in San Francisco, where they derive
their Incomes, but they will not do so as
long as they can find better homesites in
the towns around the bay. These thou
sands of people are not of any benefit to
thia city. but are a decided detriment, for
they bring nothing here and they lake
much away. They would never take these
long, uncomfortable and expensive trips
morning and night if they would be as
well accommodated where they do their
business."
Judge Lemme made a strong argument
in favor of the park system, and said that
if the park bonds are defeated It may
mean the defeat of all the bonds. "This
measure Is not a local measure, but Is a
matter of concern to the whole city," said
he. "If citizens do their duty on Decem
ber 27 there will be a three-fourths rote
in favor of bonds, Instead of the neces
sary two-thirds."
Judge A. W. Thompson said lawyers
tried to get at the meat of â  case and to
waste no time over points that are con
ceded. "Last Sunday." said he, "at I
public debate everybody conceded that
this Is a good time to issue bonds for
sewers, for schools and for a proper hos
pital. Yet there are some people woo
oppose bonds for parks These are the
men who are not anxious to show the
world that San Francisco has. entered
upon a new era of progress."
Major IfcÃenna said that a year ago,
when the bosses were In control, it would
have been "suicide to vote for bonds to
supply boodle for thieves. Now," be de
clared. "It Is not only safe, but a duty,
to vote for all the bonds."
Charles A. Swelgert also spoke In favor
of all the bonds.
Cheer Advocates of Bonds.
At Masonic Hall. South San Francisco,
C. H. Mills presided over I largely attend
ed meeting at which Mayor Phelan made
a rousing speech.
"There are opponents of the panhandle
extension," snld the Mayor, "who cry out
that the city should own public Institu
tions first, We have answered this objec
tion time and again and have shown that
we cannot have everything at once, but
must get them by degrees. There are
ptill many among us who evidently think
that we should continue in our municipal
Kip Van Winkle sleep, and who deprecate
any attempts that may be made to disturb
those deathly slumbers.
"This Is not a question of luxury, but a
question of necessity. We must have
parks, because parks are a very Impor
tant and necessary* element in modern
cities. If we want to be a modern city
we must prow and we must make our city
attractive. We have a big park, but where
is it? Is It easy of access? Certainly not.
It seems to me that it is an Insult to an
intelligent citizen to ask him. to vote for
bonds for the panhandle extension because
every intelligent citizen must surely be
convinced that it Is now a necessity. No
matter which way we view the matter,
the extension of the panhandle Is a bene
fitâlt will bring our beautiful park to the
people; It will Increase property values; It
will augment business and It will be a
signal to the whole world that San Fran
cisco is wide awake."
Speeches were also made by W. W.
Stowe, principal of Burnett Grammar
School, and P. M. Wellln. Â«"Â»"^
Divorce Suits Filed.
Suits for divorce have been filod by
Lillian F. Blankman against Armand E

WASHINGTON. Do 19.â The House
was In session two hours to-day. largo
number of perfunctory resolutions for
printing; for committees, leave to sit dur
ing session, etc.. necessary to pet the
committees under way, were adopted and
the several portions of the President's
messaÃe distributed la accordance with
the usual custom. Speeches were made
by Grow, the venerable ex-Speal;er of the
House, in defense of the administration's
course In the' Philippines, and by Hell, a
Colorado Populist, criticizing the Presi
dent's utterance upon the prosperity of
the country. Scores of members left

venerablt; ex-Speaker of th.- House, Je
sired to address thÂ«- House for forty
minutes upon the resolution, and it was
arranged that the Democrats should have
iin equal amount of time if they desired
it.
Grow read a carefully prepared ?T>eech
in defense of the polio' of retaining pos

victory In Manila. He said the people of

Club to match them for the main
event of its evening's entertainment.
Both men are clever and are consid-
red to be stiff punchers, and as each

INVERARY
SCORED AT
GREAT ODDS
Ring Laid 150 to 1 About the
Outsiderâ Baldwin Stable
Suspended.
When Frank Van Ness was trainer of
the mighty Morello. the then greatest
racer of the day, he was one of the most
talked about men of the turf. Since the
decline and death of that great horse Van
Ness has experienced many ups and
downs. Yesterday be sent a horse called
Inverary 1 1 to the post at Oakland track,
and again became a muehly-gosslj.eri
about individual. Inverary, a full brother
to Scottish Chieftain, trained by him. was
â  starter In the second event, and Ih6
books laid as good as 130 to 1 againrt the
brown gelding. In a hard drive the dâ
spised outsider, piloted by an ebony-hued
rider called Heinson. reached Mi.- wire a
length before True Blue. Torslda, favor
ite for the race, finished third. Several
cf the books had their sheets spoiled by
taking small wagers on the winner.
i he track was slow, and it proved a
disastrous day for favorite followers.
Timemak^r and Osculation being the only
Ones to land.
Corolla, from the Burns & Waterhousa
stable, was installed favorite for the first
event, a scramble for maiden two-yesir
olds. but failed to get a mark. Billy Ma
grane sent Tuthlll to the post, and the
colt won hands down from Del Vista, La
Amiga ran third.
The second edition of the issue for maid
ens of the two-year-old division saw
Caesar Young go into the starter's hanis
favorite. With Bullman on his back, lie
sulked from the start, never looking dan
gerous. In a bard drive Tommy Burns,
with the leg up on Will Fay, downed Up
percrust half a length. Artilleryman,
badly Interfered with during the tour, ran
a bang-up third.
Uarda, a mare with quite an Eastern
reputation, started for the first time in
the mile selling run. fourth on the card,
and at odds of 4 to 1 won handily trom
Red Pirate. Morse had the mount anl
made all the running. The favorite. First
Call, ran unplaced. El Estro, the stanch
ly backed second choice, after showing
prominently for half the distance, sudden
ly dropped out of It.
Through the superior Jockeyshlp of
Tommy Burns, Timemaker was enabled
to defeat Decoy a neck for the seven fur
long run. The Schorr horse had a pro
nounced call In the betting, and In a
punishing drive earned the verdict.
Decoy would have won could little T.
Walsh have given him mure assistance.
Dr. Nembula was a close third.
Backed from 5 to I to I to 5, Osculation
gathered In the last event almost without
effort. Faunette. from the stable of W.
J. Spiers, took second place from Ping by
three engths. .
Track Notes.
The run of 111 Kstro in th<- fourth event
was such a. peculiar one that the judges
suspended th<- Baldwin stable as well ns
Jockey Eddie Ross. The matter will be
thoroughly Investigated.
Dave Bachman whs one of the "fortu
ri.it.-s" who played [nverarjr.
KrÂ»il Peach took a lc>n(.'. hard fall out of
Xl Kstr,>.
Johnny Coleman nu*\ to bump Time
niakÂ»>r ;ir'd Osculation, and had a long line
after each had turned up winner.
Henry, who rode True Blue, tossed the
away. This Roman-nosed young
man has suddenly become Of Kreat Im
portance to himself and thÂ»> betting public
as well, and is contemplating the Â»*reotion
of a hat factory. If during the progress
of a race he would attend to the piloting
of his own horse and not endeavor to foul
every other starter within a furlong of
him he, would stand h much greater
chance of earning the Victoria cross.
After many trials and tribulations.
"Quill" Morse rode a winner In Uarda.

RUDIE FISCHBECK'S
COWARDLY ASSAULT
PUTS PROFESSOR TOPPING TO
SLEEP WITH A KICK.
Loses His Gracie, Blames His Victim,
and When the Opportunity Ar
rives Vents His Anger.
Rudle Fischbeck, who has long posed
as a master of the manly art. has demon
strated the fact that the 'credit of all
of the fights he ever won was due to the
assistance of his feet after a knock-down
from behind. Last night about 11 o'clock
Rudle worked himself Into a sweat over
the loss of his Grade, and in consequence
Professor A. J. Toppingâ he who wields
the mystic cardsâ whom Rudie blames for
Grade's loss, is wearing his right eye in
mourning.
At the hour named Professor Topping,
accompanied by Frank Murray, manager
of the Prawley company, entered the Cor
onado saloon, Ellis and Powell streeiÃ,
for the purpose of enjoying a talk and
trying to enjoy one of Rudie's drinks. As
the friends walked to the bar Rudle, who
was behind the board, addressed" Murray
and suld that he would not serve his com
panion. Plschbeck then walked from be
hind the bar and invited Topping Into a
side room, under the pretense that he
had Important business which he wished
to discuss.
As Topping stepped to the door. Rudle.
without warning, ripped In a right swing
over Topping's eye. knocking him down,
and as he hit the floor his assailant kicked
him over the right eye. Murray and sev
eral bystanders hurried into tho side
room, carried Topping, who was uncon
scious. Into an adjoining room and up
braided Rudie for his cowardice. Tupping
was soon In a condition to leave the Joint,
and he wits accompanied by friends to
his apartments. Topping vows that ho
will even the Â«core with lit.- assailant, but
he will hunt grounds other than those oc
cupied by Fischbeck, as he is distrustful
of the unsavory gang that haunts the
place after th* night has fallen and tho
police are weary.
SACRAMENTO-RIVER BRIDGE.
The Supreme Court has reversed the
Judgment of the lower court In the case
of the county of Sacramento against the
Southern Pacific Company and the Cali
fornia Pacific Railroad Company. The ac
tion was to recover $13,000 and 20 per cent
damages. The California Pacific Railroad
Company joined with the county in a
project -to build a bridge across the
Sacramento River, which was to be 'ised
by the railroad and the overhead road
way by the general public, the latter to
be maintained as a public highway. The
county agreed to aid the railroad com
pany by contributing $20,000. to be given
in two payments, the construction to bo
finished by December 31. 1595. It was also
stipulated that if the company fallea to
keep Its agreement it would refund the
money paid by the county. The Super
visors were advised by the District Attor
ney that the contract was valid and the
first payment of $15,000 was made. In Oc
tober, l *>>-Â the county, upon the cia'in
that It never entered Into .i valid con
tract with the defendants, brought action
to recover the money already paid ami _TÂ»
per cent as penalty. This was ba.scd
upon the claim that the contract was
contrary to the statutes, which require
plans and specifications to be furnished.
The bridge was completed according to
agreement and has since been used as a
public roadway. In the lower court Judg
ment went to the plaintiff, but the Su
preme Court says: "In the face of the
finding of fact quoted we are at a loss to
see how this money in equity or good
conscience belongs to Sacramento
County." The county certainty obtained
the benefit of the money expended so tno
higher court holds, but if In the future
the railroad company falls to keep the
bridge In repair or closes the thorough
fare, then the county may come In tor
redress.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
MANILA. Nov. 21.â Belated m.ill re
ports have reached Manila of an expe
dition on the island of Cebu last month
by a small force of American soldiers of
the Sixth Infantry which was repulsed
by the insurgents mainly through the de
sertion of native allies upon whom th.j
Americans depended. Two of the Amer
icans were killed and two wounded, and
In the force of native police accompany
ing them one was killed and four wound
ed. No ofllcial report of the affair ha*
reached General Otis, consequently the
censor refused to permit the incident to
be cabled, but the correspondent of th*
Associated Press has obtained an ac
count from a thoroughly reliable source.
The Infantrymen killed were Daniel K.

The American commander at head
quarters ml town of CcbU received In
formation that a force of IndurgentM
occupied the village of Maulbaul on tnÂ«Â»
west coast of tho island, that they wcro
levying heavy taxes and taking food .uul
horses and that the villager* would 'jo
glad to have them driven away. Captain
Walker look a detachment of ten soldiers
i aboard the steam launch Powerful on tho
! 14th of October and proceeded along tho
coast, stopping at the towns of Naga and
Carcal, where ten men were added 10 iha
force from each garrison. At the latter
town a body of 16w native policemen, who
were friendly to tiie Amen wua
mustered Into the service by tneir c-i<
tain, Sunor Majla. These natives wtro
armed with spears and bo. 03 and had but
a few guns among them. On the evening
of the 16th the Powerful reached Maui
baul and her passengers were landed
with dimculty. The- insurgents had re
treated ;o the hills, so tho force camped
for the night. Early in the morning it
was on the march. The Company C de
tachment acted us advance guard and tno
natives brought up the rear. For threo
miles they advanced along a narrow road
with the >â¢ â â â  on one aide and high clIHa
on the other. Finally they were cr:n
pellcd to tnter a rocky pass and ?vero
lorced to "march two abreast. Just as
they entered the im.-s then: Â»a.< a groat
explosion almost in their faces and t'.iey
were covered by a shower of soft dirt.
The Insurgents had prepared a gun
powder mine to annihilate the party, but
the soil in the rocks wiu so powdery that
the Americana suffered no Injuries be
yond bruises. The explosion was fol
lowed by a brief but exciting experience.
Immediately after the report Filipinos
hidden in the cliffs opened tire. Two
i Americans and five natives fell at the first
volley, which cairn from very short range.
The commander of the police was hit In
the hand and a pair of field glasses which
he carried were shattered. Tho polica
were thrown in confusion ami after a moÂ»
ment's hesitation they fell back and be-
K. 'i to run. leaving the few Americana to
bear the attack. This tho men of th*Â»
Sixth did bravely. They retired In g<v>l
I order carrying their dead and wounded,
i and returning the insurgent tiro with such
I effect thai eighteen of tho enemy were
! killed. The party returned to Mnulbaul
and re-embarked fr.r Cebu. whero they

The conduct of the native police found

was sent to the City Prison, where he was
booked for disturbing the peace.
Any number of respectable women have
complained lately to the police of similar

pastime in which he was engaged when

In the Policu Court yesterday morning-,

defendant Just before he placed him under
arrest, swearing 1 positively that there
could have been no mistake In Ockey'a un

The policeman was so busy taking: care of

NEVILLS EXTORTION CASE.
Supreme Court Evidently Not Satis-
fied That Crime Was Committed.
The Supreme Court has reversed the
Judgments in the cases of Elsie Williams
and A. Azhdcrlan, who were convicted of
the crime of extorting: $2000 from W. A.
Nevllls, the millionaire mining man. It
will be remembered that Nevllls and the
Williams woman were extremely friendly
according: to the testimony at the tilaJ.
The two pnrted after a time and 6he be
came familiar with Azhdcrian. who vas
the foreman on one of the mining man's
Fresno farms. The relations between
Nevills and the woman wen renewed at
various times, and- on one occasion he
gave her KHift.
The prosecution claimed that NevJlls
parted with the money under fear, the de
fendants having ,-it. Ned to expose the
relationship between Nevllls and the
woman if he did not do so. Tho de
fendants were convicted of extortion and
appealed to the Supreme Court. In 'their
appeals they laid special stress upon
errors of the lower court In Its instruc
tions to the trial Jury.
On this point the higher court Bays that
the instruction!* given did not correctly
present the law of extortion. A slight
rear on the part of the prosecuting wit
ness was not sufficient. "The statute can
'< only mean that the unlawful use of roe
or fear must be the operating or control
ling cause which produces the consent.
If some other cause were the primary and
controlling one in inducing the consent,
then there would be no extortion." The
Justices of the Supreme Court, however,
seem to take a different view of the case
from that of the trial jury. They review
the testimony, which shows that the

Chairman Bylngton remarked that the

Architects Notify the Supcrr'sor?
That the Contractors Have Vir
tually Abandoned the Hnll
of Justice.
A strong likelihood extsts that thÂ© con
tract of Hat. man Bros. â  on the Hall of
Justice building will be taken away from
them by the city. At the meeting of tne
Board of Supervisors held December 1
the contractors were granted an exten
sion, which expired yesterday, when a
communication was filed with the- Board
of Supervisors by the firm asking for a
further extension of fifty days. As the
Public Buildings Committee did not meet
yesterday no action was taken, and.' con
sequently, the extension has lapsed and
the contract stands forfeited to the city.
The committee will meet this afternoon
to consider the matter. .. _
Chairman "Holland has received a let
ter from Shea & Shea, the architects, in
which it is stated that the building had
been virtually abandoned by the contract
ors, and that then* -yet remained consid
erable work to be done. The communica
tion reads as follows:
Edward Holland, Chairman Building Com
mittee: In reply to your communication
relative to the amount of work performed
upon the Hall of Justice by Bat. man Broth
ers during the last three weeks, covering
Hit- two late extensions of time granted by
your body, we will state that nothing has
been done except the changing of three sets
of doors. The building, since the decision
of Mayor Phelan relative to the locking de
vice, has been virtually abandoned by the
contractors.
There Is a vast amount of work yet to bÂ«
done under the original contract and final
â affluent as follow*: Plumbing, $500;
painting, $800; plastering, WOOd Batch, hard
ware, glass, etc., |S0O; gratings for cell cor
ridors, elevators, etc., $1500; locking devices
for cells, $5500.
This work will consume much time, In
proper execution and demands Immediate
attention at your hands If the costly fit
tings now being placed are to be preserved
from ruin. We therefore ask for instruc
tions and proper authority to act In this
very Important matter. Respectfully.
SHEA & SHEA.
The Mayor is also In receipt of a letter
from the representative of the Jlrm to
whom the contract for the locking device
for the building was to have been award
ed. It reads:
Mayor James D. Pheianâ Dear Sir: Tour
favor of the 13th lnst. to hand. asking If
Bateman Brothers have .1- yet made any
arrangements with me for the locking de
vice for Hall of Justice. They have not
as yet bÂ«*n to see me or made Inquiry of
any kind. I understand from parties with
whom they have talked on the subject that
they do not Intend to purchase any looking
device from the Pauly Jail Company, but
will try a substitute of some kind. Re
spectfully, JOHN T. LONG.
"When the last extensionâ among: tha
many othersâ granted to the Bate
mans, Mayor Phelan stated that it would
be the last, and Intimated that the con
tractors were acting In bad faith.
"It appears." said the Mayor, "that
the firm is endeavoring to make as much
out of the $10,000, which was set aside
to complete the building, as it possibly
can. I understand that the locking device
will bo furnished for $5000. and that Is
practically all that remains to be done.
The Batemaiis evidently desire to substi
tute an Inferior device, but they will
not be permitted to do so. One of my
first official acts was to sign this con
tractânearly three years ago. The build

AN ACTORS INGRATITUDE.
Samuel King Convicted of Stealing a
Pair of Shoes From William
Mohring.
For the next few months the rialto will
miss the attractive presence of Samuel
King, a vaudeville artist at the Chutrs,
will be relegated to-day to the se
clusion of the County Jail by Judge Con
lan.
King and William Mohring of 143 Taylor
street, an actor at the Olympia, used to
do the rialto together. About two weeks
ago King called upon Mohring and ask-d
him to do something for him. as ho w.is
starving. Mohring gave him a pair of
shoes, which he told him ho could "soak"
and spend the proceeds in getting a
square meal. King got 50 cents on the
shoes and obeyed Mohrings Instructions.
A few days later King again felt Ui*Â»
pangs of hunger, but instead of asking
Mohring to help him. he was ungrateful
enough to go to Mohiing's room and
steal- a pair of tan shoes valued at $4 s<t.
which he "soaked" for $1 50. King <1!d
not visit his usual haunts, and Mohring
did not come across him till Monday att
ernoon, wlun he saw him on the rerry
boat crossing from Oakland. Mohnng
waited till King got outside the ferry
building, and then be gTabbed hold of him
and held him until Policeman Ingham <Â»(>

story and placed King under arrest on a
charge of petty larceny.
King appeared before Judge Conlan yes

Much of the writing of the world Â«s poor
because people attempt to write a style
that Is too complicated. The result Is
poorness. Too many want fancy forms â
they need plain ones. It Is the old. old
â tory of wanting things we do not earn
by toll. Ix>ng loops and Intricate capitals
require Krent skill to make look well. No
one but professionals should attempt
them.
Plainness Is always In good taste. Oond
ness is always desirable. Writing Is no
exception to the rule. The forms givÂ»?n

them critically and th*n try then
how round and wide they are. Be patt--nt

H. ARITHMETIC OF THE OFFICE.
Lesson No. 7 â English Money.
English invoices are in pounds, shillings
and pence. To change the values of Eng
lish currency to the values in dollars and
cents is an interesting arithmetical exer
cise. We must first understand clearly
the meaning of the par of exchange and
the variation in currency quotations.
The par of the currency of any two
countries means among merchants the
equivalency of a certain amount of the
currency of the onÂ© in the currency of the
other, supposing the currencies of both
countries to be of the precise weight and
purity tlxcd by their respective mints.
Thus, according to the mint regulations of
Great Britain and Franco Â£1 sterling Is
equal to 25.2 francs, which Is said to be
the par between London and Paris. The
exchange between the two countries is
said to be at par when bills are bought or
sold at this rate. When Â£1 in London
buys more than 25.2 francs exchange is
said to bo in favor of London. The par
of exchange between Great Britain and
the United States Is 14 86 2-3; that is, Â£1
sterling is worth $4 St> 2-3. Exchange is
quoted daily in New York, Chicago and
other cities at 4.67 or 4.57&, or â Â» v, etc..
for sight bills and at slightly towel rates
for sixty-day bills'. Theso axe the two
kind? of bills usually bought. The sixty
day bills are as good as cash when they
reach London, but they are cashed at a
discount from their face values if pre
sented before maturity. It is sufficient
for the student to understand in this con
nection (1) that the value of English
money expressed In dollars and cents may
vary/ from day to day, according to the
condition of the money market; (2) that
to pay an English Invoice we go to a
banker doing a foreign business and buy
a draft on London (called a bill of ex
change) and send it to our creditor; (3)
that this draft may be payable at sight
in London or it may be payable In sixty
days.
Find the value of Â£4 IBs 6d in dollars and
cents when the rate of exchange Is 4.555.
To solve this problem we must first re
duce ISs C*l to the decimal of a pound.
This is done by charging ISs 6d to pence
and dividing by 240, because there are 213
pence in a pound; ISs 6d=222d; that Is,
222-24Qths of a pound, which is equivalent
to .925 pounds.
Then Â£4 Us 6d=Â£4.925. and to reduce
this to dollars and cents we multiply 4.923
by the rate of exchange, which is given
as 4.&50. The work will be as follows:
4.925
i m
mm
m >
mm
19700
24.058625
The result is. therefore. $24 06. We can
save time In such solutions if we adopt
what Is known as the contracted method
of multiplying decimals:
4.525
MM
HIM
3.940
.394
.024
111 1 Hi
The student will notice that the decimal
4.855 is written backward; the 4 Is placed
under the third figure of the decimal of a
poundâ .92s. We multiply by 4 for the
first product: by 8 for the second, but In
multiplying by 8 we omit all figures In the
multiplicand to the rightâ thus: 8 times 3
are 40. carry 4; I times 2 are 16 and 4 are
20; put down 0 and carry 2, and so on. We
simply go one place to the right in each
instance to find out what to carry.
The work of reducing pounds. shilling*
and .pence to equivalent values In dollars
and cents can be greatly shortened by th*
following rule for reducing shillings and
pence to the decimal of a pound.
Write one-half of the shilling* for the
, first figure of the decimal; multiply thÂ«
spacing. ThÂ» pen may bo raised In molt
ing P. n find K. }'â â â  sure you sco % thÂ«
forms clearly before attempting .o rriiike
them.
The plate of O*l shows how these stmpta
forms may be modified In utmost endless
ways. In fart there iÂ» no one way that
seems be3t suited to all You should se
lect or Invent the styles you like best md
then perfect them. Oood writing may
differ and yet be Rood.
Use common-sen** In writing as in
other things. A handwriting is a Ufa com
panion. It cannot be changed as readily
as the fashion and dress. Therefore adopt
a hand that is not based upon some local
or passing fad or fashion. Affectation Is
one of the things to avoid. Do not try to
appear Hater or freakish unless you are.
Do not affect the vertical unless you can
write it better than any other. Frills and
ruffles In dress are all right If well made
and worn with due discretion, so aro
grace line* and compound curves In writ-
Ing, but both demand more attention than
most people care to, or have the time and
patience to. take and use.
Much, however, as you may be Inclined
to writÂ© prettily. It will be well to bear
In mind two things: that writing at Its
simplest Is rather difficult, ami that writ-
Ing Is a useful rather than a fine art.
Both of these facts Indicate that plain -
ness Is doubly desirable. It is much bet
ter to master a legible style than to fail
to master an ornate one. Few people
have the patience or perseverance to
master a fancy style of writing. All ran
master a readable hand. Illegible writing
Is not unlike mumbling or lisping In
speech. Nor Is It unlike stuttering.
One of th#Â» first requisites to good writ-
Ing is good pens (neither very coarse nor
fine), good : 1 ink (black Is I
! table or <leak, not too high, and a
healthful position of the body. The han-1
should not be twisted, nor allowed to rest
heavily upon the side.
pence by 4 for the next two figures; If thÂ»
last product la between 12 and 3* add one,
if between 36 and Â«>Â» add 2. if the â¢hill
ings are uneven add 6 to the second deci
mal figure.
Now let us apply this rule to our prob
lem. We have the following sum In Eng
lish money:
Â£4 Mj Â«d
Â»!>25
Divide the shilling,* by 2; this rives us
9. Multiply the pence by 4 and add 1 and
we have 2a. or the complete decimal. .925.
This is much easier than reducing to
pence and dividing by 240.
Take an example where there Is an un
even number of shillings:
Â£3 13s Td
=3.629
5
i m
The rule say to add sto the second fig
ure of the decimal when thÂ» number of
shillings is uneven.
The student will now proceed to reduce
the following amounts in English money
to dollars and cents:
Iâ Â£2 Ms M; rate of exchange. 4.90.
2â Â£6 12s 4d; rate of ex-hang- 4.87.

Judge Ogden Sets a
Sober Standard.
Oakland Office Ban Francisco Call.
â¢06 Broadway, Dec. 19.
Â»â¢Â£Â£Â°f Judge F. B. Ogden Inaugurated
another Innovation to-day by creating a
new standard of American dtlzenshin
one whose Intent and purpose would ex
clude foreigners who axe too much given
to flirting with the festive bowl that In
toxicates. As a consequence Peter Me
<- askill a Canadian subject of Queen Vic
toria, has failed to achieve the object of
Ms ambition, and In addition he will most
irobably lobe his Job as a ship carpenter
at the Mare Island Navy Yard
Peter McCasklll had been residing at
Haywards for several years, and whether
r..s Government Job In the navy yard
*hould continue Intact depended upon his
ability and qualification to register to-day
as a citizen of the United States.
McCasklll came early to avoid the rush
any possibly unforeseen delays. rea
tf-rday morning he appeared In Judge Og
oen Â« court ready to be ex
amined on questions pertaining, to
nls qualifications for admission to
mizc-nshJp. He was accompanied
r>y his sponsors. Charles Rupprlcht, a dep
uty County Assessor, and J. J. Carthy.
But Judge Ogden was busily occupied
with other matters and Invited the appli
cant for citizenship to appear again later
In the day. McCasklll did so.
Late In the afternoon McCasklll sailed
Into court quite a few sheets In the win.l.
He walked up before the Judge's bench
after the fashion of a nervous passenger
on a boat being pitched by a heavy sta.
Judge Ogden promptly surmised the In
toxlcatt-d condition of the applicant and
as promptly dismissed him from his pres
ence.
To-day McCaeklll, having regained his
equilibrium, appeared in a sober frame of
mind ar.d body to renew his desire to re
rounce his allegiance to the Queen and
become an accredited citizen, when Judge
<Â»gden very emphatically denied him a
liresence.
"I pave you an opportunity vesterlay
to be examined." said Judge Ogden. "and
you appeared In an Intoxicated condition.
A man who would come Into a court of
Justice In that condition Is not a fit sub
ject to he admitted to citizenship In tr-.e
United Statea. I will not entertain your
application any further, nor will I hear
nry testimony. If another Judge- will
hear you. very well, but I will not. and
you cannot become a citizen through this
court."
McCasklll. greatly chagrined, left the
courtroom meditating upon the fata of
his Government Job.
HELD COURT AT SICK
WITNESS' BEDSIDE
OAKLAND, Dec. 39.â There was a novel
proceeding to-day In the suit of W. A.
House against H. A. Maehler for an ac
counting. When the case was called for
trial before Judgo Greene thÂ« attorney
for tho defense moved for a continuance
on the ground that defendant's wife, one
of tho principal witnesses, was too ill to
appear In court. Tho plaintiff raised an
objection, but the Judge compromised the
matter by deciding to hold court at the
bedside of Mrs. Maehler at her home In
Piedmont. Tho Judge, clerk, stenog
rapher, attorneys and witnesses proceeded
to tho Maehler residence this afternoon,
and there Mrs. Maehler's deposition was
taken.

CALIFORNIA BUREAU
TO SERVE COMMERCE
THREE ASSOCIATIONS ASKED TO
FAVOR IDEA.
Action Deferred Until After Proposi
tion Has Been Fully and Care
fully Considered at
Meeting*.
The Manufacturers' and Producer*" Ae
fodation. the Merchants* Association and
the State Hoard of Trade have been re
quested to take up at their meetings to
he held In January the subject of the es
tablishment of a bureau at Washington,
headed by some able Californlan. whoso
business It will bo to watch all Indications
between cessions of Congress that might
iJTect the commercial Interests of Cali
fornia. This Idea was originated when it
appeared that the reciprocity treaties
negotiated with France and Jamaica con
tained provisions that **â detrimental
to this State.
One idea advanced Is that It Is to the
Interest of the State to have California
viroaucts placed under low export rates.
This Is the practice of the large Intercuts,
t<> it is hold, that are largely concerned In
Laving the reciprocity treaties negotiated.
These according to the same view of the
case are American enterprises, like the
Standard Oil Company. Representation
thut there was a chance to widen the
market for any product was probably the
Initial step. The next was to communl
rato with the Government of the foreign
country In which a wider Held was sought.
Then correspondence would follow* but
when ibis na< going on California's knew
nothing of the matters discussed and
were in totnl ignorunco how their Inter
cuts might be affected.
A German reciprocity treaty Is probably
well under way. Minister White told
lcldor Jacobs at Berlin some months ago
that such treaty was under consideration
Ly -son and the representatives of the
German Government.
Mr. Jacobs said yesterday that he was
toon going to Europe and expected to gain
home information there. He was firm in
the belief that the time to do effective
work for the benefit of California at the
national caj ltal was before conditions ad
verso to Californlan interests were con
trived and put into treaties. The pros
perity cf the State, he said, depended
upon the proper distribution of its prod
ucts intended for export- Work of that
port was of the highest value.
Nothing farther will probably be ef
fected toward the establishment of the
proposed bureau at Washington until
af tÂ« r the three associations have had time
to act.

LIVED IN A HUT UNFIT FOR HABITATION.
WHHRE THE SUFFERING MAN WAS FOUND.
57v? LAMEDA, Dec. 19.â Living: In a
/LAX hovel without the necessities,
ft \ much less the comforts of life.
Health Officer Stldham found
William Abjohn, and had him removed
to the Oakland Receiving Hospital,
where the old man Is now dying from
pneumonia contracted In the hut in
which he lived. This discovery by the
Health Officer has disclosed a remark
able and unusual family condition.
William Abjohn and his wife have
lived for years within four doors of
each other, the wife In a house of her
own, and the husband In a little hut In
the rear of the homestead, which has
been placed In his wife's name and
which Is now rented. While they
have lived thus for years. U. wife
never visited her husband and ho
never visited her, unless he got drunk
and then he was always arrested for
his visit.
Health Officer Stldham was notified
last Sunday that the old man was
rick in the hut In which he had been
living, and visiting the place Mr.
Stidham found that the old man was
suffering from Inflammatory rheu
matism and pneumonia, and that the
place where he was staying was not
lit for a well person, much less a sick
man. Ho then ordered him removed
to Oakland, where he is now being
cared for.
Abiohn and his wife have been sep
arated for several years, and so com
plete was this estrangement that she
did not even visit him when he was
taken sick, and the old man told the
Alameda police that he had called at
her house before he went to his hut
and Ehe would not give him a drink
of water.
Mrs. Abjohn does not deny these
statements, but says that she has
been so badly treated by her husband

After tho ceremonies, In the presence of
a very large number of members and vis

floor, where a supper, such as this lodge
always has at Its festivities, a gem of the
gastronomic art. was served. During the
evening E. F. Delger. the retiring master,
was on behalf of the lodge, presented a
beautiful Jewel of his rank, and he In turn
presented the new master. E. J. Thomas

Then followed responses to toasts, by K.

the festive occasion.

of the season was made public yesterday,
when Mr. and Mrs. Sands Forma an
nounced that their daughter. Miss Ger

J. Brander early in January, IS9O.
The announcement of the engagement

of the Drlde-to-be, who for the past few
reasons has been a popular belle. The
happy man is a Londoner and the coast
representative of the wealthy London
shipping concern, the Pacific Island Com
pany. It was not the intention of tho

on advice from the home ofllce making it
Imperative that Mr. Bran proceed to

Australian sojourn, remain in this city for
pome time, their ultimate home will be in
London. The exact date of the marriage
h.ia not yet been Fet and the only ar-.
rangement bo far decided upon is that the
wedding will be a very quiet one.

Mrs. AtiJ hn called at the Receiving
IUJ In Oakland to-nUht for tIM
first time Flnce her husband v. as tak
en sick. Bhe refused to see him and
left orders what to do with him
should he die.
"If Mr. Abjohn dies I would like to
have him sent to St. Mary's Ceme
tery," said an elderly woman, who did
not Introduce herself to Steward Bor
chert to-night.
"But the man Is not dead yet." said
the steward In surprise, "and he must
have some relatives. Are you a rela
tive of his?"
"Not a blood relative." replied tho
woman.
"Well, wo will have to see his wife,"
â â¢Id Mr. Borchert.
"I was his Wife, but we are not liv

"Would you like to see him?" asked
the steward.
"No. I don't care to g-o In." said
Mr*. Abjohn. and she left, having
merely made arrangements for his
funeral while he was still alive.
Health Officer Surinam has ordered
the hovel in which the old man lived
cleaned, and has declared It unfit for
habitation and will allow no one to
occupy It In the future.
"I have very little hope of living
and no regrets If I should die." said
Abjohn to-day, as he lay on a cot
at the Receiving Hospital. "Death
would now he the greatest satisfac
tion of a life that has been full of
mistakes. I would rather be dead ten
times over than ever go back to my
wife. It has been one continual bat
tle between us and It Is well that we
are the only two fools perhaps, for we
have neither friends nor enemies.
Three times she has tried to pet a
divorce, because she says I was cruel,
but she failed. I would not try to
pet one from her. because I didn't
think It worth the while, and any way
all she wants Is the property, worth
about $4000. I bought the property
with my earnings from the railroad.
"But what Is thÂ« use, of talking
about her? It will all be over soon.

WILL DELIVER NO MAIL ON SUNDAYS IN OAKLAND
OAJCI^AND, Dec 19.â The action
of Postmaster W. H. Friend of
Uof Postmaster W. H. Friend of
Oakland In announcing that
Sunday mall delivery at the
Oakland postotUce will be stopped
after January 1 has set a new stand
ard for poatofllce work all over the
country and has attracted no little
comment from all sides. Every church
or religious society In Alarneda County
has taken some action upon this mov<\
and every one of them supports tho
action of the postmaster of Oakland.
"I have decided to do away with the
usual Sunday delivery at the Oaklani
Slot." explained Postmaster
Friend to-day, "because I do not con
sider it absolutely essential for tho
well-being of Oakland. This Sunday
delivery of mall means that one-hn'f
of our carrier force Is compelled to bÂ»
on duty for practically the whole of
Sunday, or. In other words, the car
riers have but two Sundays a month
off instead of four. It Is the policy of
the Federal Government to recognize
Sunday wherever possible, and In my
Judgment It Is very possible in this
case. I can appreciate that in the case of largo cities, where thero is a large
transient population that needs Its mall on Sui.day. a Sunday dÂ»-llvry In
a necessity, but this Is not the case In Oakland. I shall probably arrange
so that the hotels get their mall on Sunday, but this will only require the
services of one carrier on Sunday, or making each carrier glvo up two Sun
days a year Instead of twenty-six Sundays as he is compelled to do now. If
I find that It Inconveniences the puDlic I will change back again, but I will
try It for a while at least."
The Christian Endeavor F.odety, the Epworth League of the Methodist
church and the men's leagues of various local churches, have all passert
resolutions commending Postmaster Friend for his action. The move has
created so much attention that postmasters from all over the coast have
been writing to Mr. Friend to ask his experiences with the new move.

EBELL SUCCESS
Ladies Praise City
Council's Action.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Dec. 19.
The ladles of the Ebell Society are
plated over the action taken by the City
Council last night in accepting their
offer to give to the city a site
for the gnat Carnegie library. This,
together with the discussion that fol
lowed the introduction of Councilman
Har.ntow's resolution accepting the site
.'tt Fourteenth and Grove streets as moat
suitable, was the chief topic talked about
by the ladles to-day.
The action of the Council has won uni
versal praise on all sides, and particularly
from the Ebell ladles. Nor is Councilman
Bchaffer's steadfast adherence to his In
dividual opposition to the last commented
upon unfavorably.
"I am glad to express my heartfelt
thanks to the City Council In the name
of the Ebell Boclety for their prompt and
courteous action 1.i.-t tvining." said Mrs
R. P. Gleason, prenldent of the Ebell, to
day. "The City Council has settle 1 a
vf-xed and long delayed question, and I
BSD sure that the Councllmen, as well as
the community, are happy that It is set
tled. The deed to thÂ« lot will bo given
to the City Council at the first meeting In
January, and it Is surely a great I
to tho members of the Ebell Society to
f< el that their work is so near comple
tion."
Just as soon as the deed to the site at
Fourteenth and Grove streets has b.-*n
tendered to and accepted by the City
Council Mr. "'irnegle will be advised that
itidltlons of his contribution of
$50,000 for a new Free Public Library
building have been complied with, and as
soon as the money is received tho City
Council will probably proceed to have
drawn plans and specifications for the
proposed structure.

Severe on Board of
Public Works.
Oaklard nffl, ,
Councilman Glrard severely censured
the Board cl Public Works at last nlcht'Â«
meeting of the City Council, and took to>
task hla confreres In a manner th,< rrÂ«
ated a flurry of excitement which ended
only after Councilman Strtson called
upon President Howe t.i protect the mem
bers against the attack. It was all tim
way. Councilman Cuvelller had Intro
duced a resolution calling attention to t !*Â«-Â»
fact that although sufficient money had
been appropriated long ago for the pur
pose of making: a complete test of tnÂ»
Roberts wells at San Leandro with a vlÂ«w
of locating a municipal fresh water nip
ply, and notwithstanding the City hn
gineer had fully recovered from his Ill
ness which had caused previous delays,
and finally, although plans had been pre
pared for some time, the Hoard of -"*ubllr
works ha.l failed to advertise for bids to
make the test.
The Cu\-elller resolution aimed to re
quest the l-oard to "{:â¢ a move nn."
Councilman Olrard. however, regarded it
In the light of a censure and declared hi*
intention to vote for Its adoption.
"The people are losing confidence In
us," Bald Mr. Glrard. "There Is no dm In,
delaying Â»hese matters. Suppose we rn<l
â  bond! lng Hoard of Public Works, as wa*
once the case, or suppose the City Kn
glneer should die. should we theretoro
allow the advantage of this option to '.i|>
away from us? We come here and talk
and talk and do nothing. Wo are n lot of
old plnheads. I say th.- people are lo^iric
confidence Ir us. This Is a resolution cen
suring thÂ«* board and 1 favor Its alop
tlon.' p
The severe arraignment brought several
members to their feet. "What are you
doing there. Mr. President?" shouted Mr.
Stetson, his query being directed to
Chairman Howe. "Are you not goln<t to
protect us against such bitter attacks?"
But Mr. Guard would not be stilled by
the gavel until he "had his say." and
that was to the effect that "the Hoard Of
Public Works ought to be censured. I
have accused no one." he concluded, and
the incident closed with the adoption of
the resolution on suspension of .h<> ru!es.
Messrs. Barstow, Mutt und Schaffer vot
ing no.
Later fn the evening Councilman Olrurrl
executed another though a milder !>\nr> &t
the Hoard of Public Works by offering a
resolution requesting that body to Â«>x
plain why the plat between thÂ»Â« E'ghlh
street bridge and Twelfth-street dim In
not being filled by the contractors dredg
ing Lake Merrill, and who are filling In
private property Instead. Chairman Row*
declared .hat while he would not vote ff>r
the resolution he would favor submitting
the matter to n committee for investiga
tion. This view seemed to meÂ«t with
most favor, and Councllmen Stetson and
Taylor, together with President I(nwÂ«,
constitute the committee to Investigate.

There was also an Immense Christmas
tree. Illuminated with red. white and Mil*
electric lights, producing a vrry prttty
effect and showing off to advantage tno
many presents which Santa Claus was to
distribute during the evening. In addition
to these the parlor manifested Its love of
country by the display of hundreds of
miniature American flags on the branch
es of the tree. Judge Frank 11. Kerrigan
was master of ceremonies for ten minutes
and he acted his part well. He was suc
ceeded by A. P. Schlelcher.
The first number on the programme was

Inverted funnel*. They carried bci>r
covers for shields and a feather du^trr
In lieu of a spear. The shout that greet
ed their appearance was almost deafen
ing. ThÂ«Â« ladles went through many pret
ty evolutions, and their performance, was
loudly applauded. Al Schlelcher, who was
the leader of the. march, was attired as
a French cook. Walter Murphy, repre

OGDEN HAS CREATED PANIC
AMONG HUSBANDS AND WIVES
The Judge's Decision That Men Who Stay Out Late Do Not
Have to Explain to Their Better Halves Is Met With the
Womanly Retort That What Is Sauce for the
Goose Is Sauce for the Gander.
c^tp RE you married or do you live
II \\ in Oakland?"
if '^ Once on a DM that was one
way of asking: a pnor devil
whether he was a man or a mou??.
It was meant to Insinuate! that the
Oakland htlbbjr did not wear the pa
trousers. It was
Intended to con
vey the Impres
sion that he ob
served the 8
o'clock ordinance
so religiously
that he went to
roost with the
chickens and
rose with the
batter for the
morning pan
cakes. It con
tained the In
nuendo that he
was a doormat at
the mercy of his
duly wedded rib.
In a few words.
It was the San
Francisco mar
ried man's way
of indicating con
tempt for hl3
Oakland brother
and making him
feel small potatoes and few In the
hill.
"Are you married or do you live in
Oakland?"
Day In and day out thÂ« question
â¢was dinned into the ears of the man
from across the bay. And at night
when lie happened to remain on this
side for the comic opera, low-down low
comedians flung It at him from tho
stage, and whole audiences rose up
and pointed at him as a mark.
The Oakland man felt duly humbled.
Long struggling with the mysteries of
the ferry commutation system hail
taken the rtnrch out of his once proud
spirit, so that once on this side of the
bay. the fear that he might, on the re
turn trip, tread on a railroad corn,
kept him from asserting himself and
defying his detractors. After a time ho
even became cunning and laughed at
the men that put the question:
"Are you married, or do you live In
Oakland?"
He hoped, poor man. to Ella Wheeler
Wilcox the tide of derlelon, but he
hoped in vain. The
San F r a n c 1 s co
married man and
his friend, the low
comedian, w o vld
not desist. Fate
only could save
the Oakland man.
How? When? It
seemed as If thÂ»*se
questions would
never be answered.
Prayers to heaven,
curses deep, all
were of no avail.
The spirit of the
Oaklandcr, crush
ed by commuta
tion, was pulver
ized by insinua
tion. Ills outlook
wan never darker
than at the begin
ning of this holi
day week. Now, It
was never bright
er. The reason is
plain. No longer do*s the San Fran
cisco man jeer and ask, "Are you mar
ried, or do you live In Oakland?" He
asks:
"Are you married and do you live in
Oakland?" N
And should you answer in the affirm
ative, ten chances to one he will fall
on your neck iiKe a brother and begin
getting pointers from you on house
rents in that beautiful city.
"Are you married and do you live In
Oakland?"
If you do, you are th* salt of the
turth, from the Pan Francisco man's

DEAL IN CANNERIES
CAUSING A FLURRY
A PBIVATE DISPATCH RENEWS
DISCUSSION.
Beports on the Street That an Agree
ment Has Been Finally Beached
at New York.
Parties Interested In California canner
ies were stirred up yesterday by the news
thai a private dispatch had been received
from New York r^tifirming the rumor
Prank S. Johnson had concluded, a
deal fv>r the consolidation of three can-
OUtstda of the combine. TI â  -
the California Canneries Company.
Limited, the Golden Gate Cannery and

This news differed materially from that
received some days ago. Then J< I
*\as reported \r> have disposed of
amounting to $700,000 In a new corpora,
tion. intended to absorb the three con
cern? namrni. the sale of the stock being
conditioned upon the acceptance of the
price for the canneries that the Eastern
people were willing: to pay. The later
rumor is that the deal is absolute.
The same denials are met with on Cali
fornia street that were heard a week ago.
Still it appears that all the parties con
r<-rned believe more firmly in the deal
than before. Johnson had options on two
canneries, so the story goes, before he de-
I for the Bast Concerning the third
concern there are conflicting stories and
the truth is hard to reach.
In thÂ»- present combine twenty-two can

is manifested, as the
new combination would bring in some
Mror.K opposition. Johnson, in addition

for the three concerns, concerning
which the stories are afloat, is represent
ba looking for a direct European
connection. Tin? woali be favorÂ©
the merchants who have taken a linai'cial
Interest in the deal in progress.
A business man. who has excellent op
portunities to know the k> n.-rai situation

that If it fhmild be- truÂ«- that Johnson

more canneries in the State than there

1, Who
v.if trying the
case, decided that,
while the fart was
established, it was
not sufficient
ground for divorce.
"When a man
Stays away Crom
home until a late
hour." said Judge
Ogden, In deliver
ing his opinion,
"that is one of the
burdens which the
wife has to bes \
Nor can the wife
compel the husband, under such cir
; nces, to give an account of hl9
â  ii where he hns boen."

hut beâ note th : s carefullyâ but he
doesn't have to give an account of his
actions or, mark this, tell where he
has been. In other words he is lord
and master and doesn't have to tell
the old familiar lies about the lodge,
and the Pick friend with whom he sat
up. or go into details about missing
the last boat and catching a news
paper tug. All he needs Is a pocket
full of keyholes and some self-pos
session.
They will pull him through. they and
the decision, and the next morning he
ran commute over to this side and
ploat over the trouble the San Fran
cisco man has squaring hlmÂ«elf for
the conjugal fictions of which he was
the author the night before. Illah
bismlllah! The Oaklander is great
nnd Ogden Is his prophet, and, like all
prophets, is not with ail honor In his
own country. Al
ready the voice
of protest has
been raised about
his ears. It is a
Mill, pinall female
voice just at pres
ent, but It's grow
ing in volume
every hour and
will soon be &
storm about his
judicial ears. It
Is the voice of
the Oakland mar
ried woman, and
already It con
tains a threat.
"What is sauce
for the goose," it
pays, "ought to
be sauce for thÂ«
pander. If a mar
ried man can
Ftay out nights
without making
explanations to
his w.HfÂ« ti->iÂ»
cannot the- wife
stay out nights without making expla
nations to her husband?"
And that's a question, when you
consider there's not a sphinx this side
of Egypt. â¢
"I am surprised." said Mrs. Sarah
Borland, president of the Oakland
Central Political Equality Club. "I urn
surprised that Judge Ogden should
givo such a decision, because the
Judge is a great friend of the home
and Is so much devoted to his own
family and home. I suppose, however,
that it is the law. But if It is. why
would it not do as well for tho woman
as for the man? What is good for the
gander ought to be good for the goose.
"When one looks closely into tho
matter, could the act of tne husband
really be called cruelty? Of course. It
did not tend to the pearÂ© of mind or
contentment of the wife. Such con
duct, it seems to mÂ«, would cause a
wife to feel that she did not have the
place in her husband's affections or
that she was not worthy of the re
spect to which she thought she was
entitled. I am inclined to think that
GOLD BRICKS GIVEN BY

and cannot legally receive compensation

.â¢ralopipt appoints them officers of the
State Mining Bureau.
The crafty schemes, the cunning dodges
and the line work to get control of the
State Mining Bureau throughout various
regimes constitute an interesting chapter.
For many years William Irelan. sus
tained by George Hearst, the able and
us miner, had free rein in the
management of the bureau. During Gov
ernor Budd'a administration the ad
mirers of asphalt, among them F. 8.

beds failed to give gold and silver ledges

It would not be improper for a hus
band tO confide in his wife to such a
degree as to tell her what has de
tained him away from home, not for
the purpose of satisfying her that he
has not been where he ought not to
have been, but for the sake of show
ing her that he holds her in his respect
and esteem. Of course, I do not think
a man ought to be nagged. I do not
think he ought to be expected to give
up all things done by his lodge or to
reveal all the details of his business.
I would not ask him to do that, but
he ought, in reality, to do something of
that kind for propriety's sake. It
would be only what he would expect
from his wife.
"Suppose a wife should leave her
home nightly and come back at will
or allow herself to be detained away
from home, and suppose her husband
was compelled to await her coming
and then receive no explanation of her
delay, the husband would feel an
noyed, and rightly so, too.
"The effect of this decision will be
felt especially by the wives of hus-
hands prone to
that kind of
treatment, and I
do not know how
it can be pre
vented. For wo
men to retaliate
would not l.r :iÂ»1

hhould exist t* -
tween h a s band
and wife."
Mrs. X I
tIR, prominent In
the equal Â«uf-
Crasjc movemr-tit
!n Oakland, voic
ed similar views.
"As I read
Judge Ogden's decision," she said, "I
could not help thinking that If a wo
man has no local redress for such ac
tion on the part of her husband per
haps the best thing for her to do
would be to treat him In like fashion.
I hardly know whether that would do
to lay down as a rule to go by In such
cases, for so much depends on Individ
ual circumstances, but that was the
thought that occurred to me at the
moment. If such a man was to find
that his wife was still out when he
returned home, and that this contin
ued night after night, I think perhaps
he would look at things in a differ
ent way.
"It seems to me Judge OgtJen has
taken a grave responsibility in giving
a decision which will certainly encour
age bad husbands In their evil ways
and which Is almost certain In this
case to lead to divorce In the end.
"For a man to stay out night after
night for months is certainly a viola
tion of the marriage contract, though
It may not be sufficient cause for di
vorce In this State: at least Judge, Og
den does not seem to think so. In
these cases, however, a wife often
knows more than she wishes to make
public, for the publicity of such a
thing is a dreadful thing for a wo
man.
"Judge Ogden may be right, but I can
not help wondering what he would do
were he to try the shoe on the other
foot; that is, if the complainant was a
man whose wife persisted in staying
out night after night and refused to
give any explanation of her conduct,
but shook htm when he cried about It
and told him not to be silly, but to go
to.bed.
"I wonder, if such a case were to
come, up, what Judge Ogdon would
say?"
Decidedly, the decision opens up a
wide question, so wide that its influ
ence may be felt all over the State, if
Judge Ogden has enunciated good law
for Oakland it is good law from Sls
klyou to San Diego, in all the towns
and cities of California, including San
Francisco, andâ lt may work both
ways.

predecessors, Messrs. Irelan and Craw
ford. It is further asserted that Mr.
Cooper went so far as to refer contemptu
ously If not disrespectfully to the Mother
Lode by asking if the Father Lode and
Sister Lode should not receive some no
t'cefrom the State authorities,
hen the Legislature convened last
W iL nt ?r? r some persons behind the scenes de
cided to punish Cooper for contempt. A
Plan to take appointments out of his
nands and if. direct the expenditure of the
bureau s appropriation was adopted. The
promoters of the punishment scheme
were not familiar with the provisions of
the constitution, hence their plans have
come to grief. The persons bent on pet
ting even with Cooper had the following
provision inserted in the general appro
priation measure:
For support of Ftate Mining Bureau. In
cluding salaries. 150.000; provided that 120.
000 of said sum i"hall be expended In mak
ing a practical and scientific examination of
the mother lode, and other mineral districts
In California, Including the oil districts,
and preparing a brief and accurate history
of i>uch districts and the development, pro
duct, resources, methods of working and
future possibilities of the mining and oil
Industries In California. Such examinations
to be made by competent experts experi
ence.] In California mining, and assistants,
an of whom shall be appointed and their
compensation fixed by the Governor.
The rhaiririin of the Senate Finance
committee. General IMckinson. perhivps
I. lot1 ot kr;ow tÂ»at the constitution >>t
this Stare (section 24. article IV) con
tained the following:
"Every act shall embrace but one
subject, which subject shall be ex
pressed in its title. But if any sub
ject shall be embraced in an act
which 6hall not be expressed in its
title, such act shall be void only as to
so much thereof as shall not be ex
pressed in its title."
There is nothing In the title of the gen
eral appropriation bill pertaining to the
scientific examination of mineral dis
tricts, oil regions, and the "future possi
bilities" of development. There is noth
ing in the title relating to the appoint
ment of experts and the fixing of their
compensation by the Governor, hence the
whole provision is void. The bill contains
this pimple title: "An act making appro
priation for the support of the govern
ment of the State of California for the
ilfty-first and fifty-second fiscal yean "
General Dickinson is not wholly to
blame in the matter. The blame rather
rests on Lieutenant Governor Neff. who
appointed â  soldier Instead of a states
man to the responsible position of chair
man of the Senate Finance Committee.
If this constitutional Inhibition had been
in the articles of war the general, doubt
less, would have observed it.
In the Assembly affairs were not much
better. The Speaker, in making up his
committee, put 1.. H. Valentine, a Los
Angeles statesman, instead of a common,
every-day, constitutional lawyer, at the
head of the Ways and Means Committee.
The bill, with its unconstitutional little
joker, ran the gauntlet of both commit
tees and both houses of the Legislature
nnd reached the Governor's office, where
ignorance of the constitution is real bliss.
Governor Gage approved the bill and in
due time appointed the experts. Bowers
and Watts.
Along in the spring or early summer
somebody told the Governor that the
"joker" was. too thin, hut that didn't Jar
his Excellency. He went right ahead and
recognized Bowers and Watts. Mineralo
gist Cooper cared not a fig for the lev
overlook, because Tom Bishop, who knew
that the State had a constitution, told
him that the Joker wouldn't go. Attorney-
ner.:l Tin L. Ford was also advised
that the "volume of legislation" in the
appropriation hill was void.
In the course of events somebody must
have told Gage that gold bricks had been
passed to Rowers and Watts, becaiuse a
meeting of the trustees of the Mining Bu
l reau was called at T. R. Bishop's office,
and it was arranged that Mineralogist
Cooper and Governor â¢ Gage should be
there. At this session Cooper was asked
to ratify the appointments made by the
Governor, but the Mineralogist refused to
ratify, hence the character of the meeting
took the form of Indignation rather than
of ratification. Cooper stands now where
he stood when the Joker was born. Gage's
plight Is no better than it was when he
signed the bill.
Cooper is serene but firm. He knows
that Attorney General Ford nnd State
Controller Colgan are well posted on the
proposition anc cannot open the treasury
to Bowers and Watts. Cooper also knows
that his own days are numbered. He is
advised that the adorable Walter R. Max
well of Los Angeles has been slated to
succeed him as State Mineralogist. In ap
pointing Mr. Maxwell the Governor ex
pects to recognize personal beauty nnd
make a concession to polite society. Mr.
Maxwell possesses all the qualifications
necessary for drawing a salary and spend
ing it In legitimate and refined channels.
The Governor Is sure that his friend Wal
ter will never speak of the Mother Lode
In terms other than those of profound re
spect and reverence.
