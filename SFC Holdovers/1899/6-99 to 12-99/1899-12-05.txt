FIFTY-SIXTH CONGRESS IN SESSION
Iq th)e hjouse Roberts of Utah Is Refused the Oath of Officeâ Senate Pays
Tribute to the Late Vice President h|obart
WASHINGTON. Dec 4.-Enor
mous crowds witnessed the
opening: Bci-nop In the House to
day. ThÂ« principal Intercut
centered In the disposition of
the care of BrlKham H. Roberts, the Mor
rinn Representative from Utah, Those
who anticipated a eensatlonal denounee
meat wore diEappolnted. The programme
outlined by tho Republican leaders at
their conference on Friday night was
1 artly carried out. The objection to the
:i<!min!rtrjitlon of the oath to Mr. Roberts
*m Â«ritÂ»Ted by Taylor of Ohio, as pre
dicted, and Roberts stepped aside without
}>rote?t except to ask If by ilolng so he
waived any of his rights. To this the
Bpeaker responded In the negative.
There wus not a protest from any quar
ter against the objection to the adminis
tration of the oath to Mr. Roberts, but
en the contrary the only voice raised ex
cept that of Taylor was that Â«>f McÃao,
a lVnwrrat of Arkansas. Mho joined with
Taylor In his protest. Taylor offered his
to refer the case to a special
crrmmittee. and by mutual arrangement
the consideration of the resolution was
jvistponed until to-morrow In order that
the routine business in connection with
the organization might be transacted to
ri ay.
Although Roberts was not sworn In to
day he necured a neat. This, however,
was by an accident pure and flmple. On
the peat-drav.lr.g lottery r.o provision had
VÂ» en made for Roberts, but when the
drawing was completed two others aa well
as himsHf had not been provided with
Frnts jnd th>Â« Speaker asked and secured
from tho House permission for those mem
lerr who had not drawn scats to make
*urh Kf lections v they could. Under this
authority Robert? pot a Feat In an oh-
BCUre portion of the hall. HI? daughter
rat in tho pallrry and watched the pro
cr-f<iinjrs fn>m I>< pinninjr to end.
After the election of Speaker Honder
r-nn and his Induction into office and thÂ«
:ip:Â«ilntment of the usual committees to
v.ait upon tho President the Feat-drawing
contest; with thÂ« usual amusing: features,
vont off without a Mtch.
The only other feature out of the or
dinary was the reception of the Reed
rulejs. The Democrat? knew it was futile
to more than protest against the adoption
ff these rules aftÂ«r the Republican dcci-
Flcn upon th!iÂ« course in caucus, and the
debate upon the resolution to adopt them
I W.I, B. HENDfcIcSON, SPfcAhfc^ oh THE HOUSE;
was very brfrf. They were adopted by a
Hriet party vote.
At 11:30 a. m. a shri'.l-voiced clerk dl
rono<J those not entitled to the floor to
retire, aiid ofllcm and pajjes rapidly
cleared out those already In.
Conspicuous on the floor were the old
veterans Payne of New York, the trader
of the ir.ajorlty: General Gmsvcnor of
Ohio. Hepburn of lowa. Dalzell of Penn
sylvania, KaJley of Texas, McClcllun and
Sulzer of Now York.
As the minute hand of the clock oppo
site the Speaker's- rostrum overtook the
hour hand at noon the gavel of the clerk
'f the last House. Major Mcl â â¢!!. de
: oended with a bang. The Indescribable
linn ceased. The members at once nroje,
.nd the enectaton In the gallery bowed
Â»*ir head*. In this stillness the voice of
ilie ehaplaJn. Rev. Henry idea of
Michigan, was elevated, and his prayer
made the o<ra>i.,n reverent. After the in
vocation the rÂ«.-nlinÂ« clerk tÂ»egan calling
the roll, and k minute later the buzz had
: ma.klr.s a. noisy background
t Â«r the staccato voice of the clerk as he
caned out the names.
Huberts nat listening intently for hi*
r.anr.e. and when it was called he respond
ed "Here!" In.a loud voice. I3ut he looked
nervous and ill at caw. There was no
demonstration during the rollcall. When
It was cr.nclurf.-d Clerk McDowell an
nmineed that :Â£2 members hud answered
to their names- a quorum.
"The next thins in order." announced
the clerk, "is the elect Inn of a Speaker."
Hepburn of lowa offered a resolution,
which was adopted viva voce. providing
that the House proceed to the election of
a Speaker for the FJfty-Fixth Congress.
Thereupon Grosvtnor of Ohio, as chair
man of the Republican caucus, presented
the name of David It. Henderson of lowa.
The mention of the name of General Hen
derson was greeted with a round of ap
plause from the Republican side. Hay of
Virginia, chairman of the Democratic
caucus, nominated James D. Richardson
at Tennessee, and his name drew the
plaudits of the Democratic side.
Rldfirley of Kansas named John C. Bell
cf Colorado a* the Populist candidate, and
Wilson of Idaho placed Francis G. New
lands of Nevada In nomination as the
candidate of the Silver party. Each party
having put forward Its candidate, by
The San Francisco Call
direction of the clerk the roll wan called
ar.d each member voted for the candidate
of his political affiliations.
Morris of Minnesota. Overstreet of In
diana and Carmack of Tennessee were
appointed tellers:
Newlands. himFelf a candidate, voted or
Mr. Richardson, the rollcall resulting:
Henderson. 177. Richardson. 153; Bell, 4;
Newlands. 2. The clerk thereupon an
nounced the election of Henderson, amid
irreat Republican applause. He designated
Richardson. Bell and Newlands as â  com
mittee to escort the Speaker to the chair.
The committee retired to the lobby and
after a short wait the main door of the
portal of the Hou?e was swung open and
General Henderson entered upon the arm
of Richardson, followed by the two other
members of tho committee.
When the Speaker ascended the rostrum
Richardson, -In a neat speech, introduced
him. and in response to the hearty cheers
he addressed the House as follows:
"Gentlemen of the House of Represen
tatives: The voice of the House has called
me to grave responsibilities. For that call
I am most profoundly grateful, and I am
' keenly sensible of the weight of the re
pponFlbilltles that attach to this great
office. I am encouraged, however, by the
thought that no member of this body can
escape responsibility, either to his people
or to his country. All of 111 are under
bonds to do our best.
"The approval of the country, the ap
proval of one's own conscience, the at
tainment of great results are not secured
by petty contests on narrow fields, but
must be sought and won on broad patri
otic lines of thought and action.
"It is my duty, as it will be my aim and
pleasure, to Impartially administer the
laws adopted for our government, but no
Speaker can be successful unless he has
the co-operation of the members of the
House.
"The generous partiality and kindness
that have been shown to me by. the en
tire membership here encourage me to be
lieve that such Imperfections as I may
have will be modified by the considerate
and supporting disposition of those consti
tuting this great body. .]Â£Â£)Â£)
"I am ready to take the oath of office."
In accordance with the time-honored
custom, the oldest member of the House

UNITED STATES SENATE IN SESSION.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. WELLINGTON* HOTEL. WASHINGTON. Dec. 4.-The usual animated scenes marked the
opcr.lns of the Fifty-sixth Congress to-day. The corridors of the Capitol were crowded with visitors long before
the galleries were thrown open, and many, as usual, failed to gain admittance. By 11 o'clock the galleries were
filled and standing room only was to be had. Women, as usual, predominated, and their bright headgear, together
with a profusion of multi-colored flowers on the desks of The members, added to the animation and brilliancy of
th<> picture. In the diplomatic galleries were the picturesque costumes of all nations.
To the casual observer, the general appearance of this season's crop of national lawmakers Is scarcely superior
to that of former years. Indeed, all Congresses look alike. Th. are always all sorts of figures to be seen on the floor.
The uncouth specimens from Kansas. Oklahoma and Texas Jostle their neighbors from fashionable New York: the Ions;
haired, clay-colored, unkempt member from North Carolina rubs elbows with the brisk, quick-stepping Yankee from
Massachusetts or New Hampshire.
In the House, out of a total of 353 members. 106, or nearly one-third, are new. New York State sends eighteen new
members out of a total of thirty-four. Th- now members are from Northern States for the most part for the South re
turns its members from, year, to yw a:' maktta fewer, oliange* *Ji >B â !.Â» â¢',Â» Northern States. The faces and figures
that were missed especially were those of ponderous Reed, diminutive, and agile U h**lor. the voluble and brilliunt Henry
L. Johnson of Indiana, the eccentric an d flashy James Hamilton Lewis: thecourtly Belknap of Illinois, the son of the
ex-Secretary of War; Dlngley. Maine's diminutive statesman: Stone of Pennsylvania, the physical giant, who Is now
(.overnor of the Keystone State: Savers of Texas, the school statesman, who looked not unlike Henderson, and who. not-
Withstanding his Ussor size, was sometimes mistaken for him.
Of the leading men of the last Congress who were returned to this. It may be said that the Republicans have the
advantage in roint of numbers. On their side are such Republicans as Grosvenor. Boutelle. Cannon. Hopkins Dalzell
Dolllyer. Cousins, Hull. Henderson. Hepburn. Mercer. Payne. Grow. Bingham. Loud, Steele. Landis (Indiana) riitt and
Dick. Tho Democrats lost ruch leader as McMUlln, Dockcry. Bayers, Wheeler. Magulre. to say nothing of James Hamil

IMPORTANT SUBJECTS FOR
LEGISLATION THIS SESSION
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLINGTON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, Dec. 4.â No Congress in re
cent years has been confronted with more important duties than those which will devolve upon
the fifty-sixth Congress. Among the most important matters that will come up will be: The ques
tion of whether Mr. Quay's appointment as a Senator from Pennsylvania is constitutional; exclusion of
Brigham H. Roberts of Utah from the House on the ground that the election of a polygamist to Congress
from that State is a violation of the agreement entered into when the State was admitted; a constitu
tional amendment for submission to the States abolishing polygamy in the United States forever and mak
ing those who practice it ineligible for office and disqualified from voting; permanent governments for
Hawaii, Porto Rico and Alaska; construction of submarine cables to the new possessions of the United
States; abolition of the Western Union Cuban cable monopoly; the bill to enact present gold standard
into law with provisions for the ultimate redemption of all United States currency in gold; increase in
bank circulation and possibly the refunding of the national debt; the bill to subsidize the merchant
marine of the United States; various propositions to amend the interstate commerce law to prevent freight
and passenger rate discriminations; proposed constitutional amendments amd bills to regulate or exter
minate trusts, to none of which the party leaders have yet given their indorsement; improvement in army
organization and increase in the ships and men of the navy. Attempts will also be made to pass a Nica
ragua canal bill: a bill for the irrigation and reclamation of arid lands; bill to segregate and classify
California mineral lands.
try under whi> h the claimant to this sent
was naturalized, and that eminent coun
sel asi rt that if this be the record in the
case this claimant is not â  â  it lzÂ»-n of thÂ»*
United States. I offer and express no
â¢ â¢pinion upon that proposition.
"Mr. Speaker, if it were possible to em
phasize the gravity of these charge* and
thÂ«> responsibility that Is at this moment
Imposed upon this House, we will tind
that emphasis In the memorials, a small
part of which could be physically cared
for in this hall, but all of which 1 now
present to this House from over 7.000.000
American men and women, protesting
against the entrance of this Representa
tive-elect from I't.-ih."
At the conclusion of Mr. Taylor's re.
marks. IfcÃae (D.) of Arkansas briefly
expressed his concurrence in the proteM
of Taylor. If the charges hanging ovr
the htad of the Representative -eject were
true, he said his being sworn in would
be an assault upon every American home. [
If true, he said. Roberts was guilty of a 1a 1
violation of the laws of the fnlted States j
and of Utah, and the charges should be
Investigated. If they were proven true,
he said emphatically in conclusion, there
should not be a vote in th<> House In fa
vor of allowing him a seat In this body.
Meantime Roberts had advanced to the
head of the aisle and stood there Irreso
lutely.
"In view of the objection," said the
Speaker, addressing him, "the gentleman
will step aside."
"I do so," replied Roberts, "with the
understanding that by my action I waive
none of my rights."
"None of the gentleman's rights will
be lost," said the Speaker, and Roberts
thereupon retired quietly to his seat.
There was no demonstration either on
the floors or in the galleries. The re
maining members were then sworn In,
after which Taylor offered hi resolution
to ref<r the case of Roberts to a special
committee. The resolution was as fol
lows:
"Whereas. It Is charged that BrlÃham
11. Roberta, a Representative-elect to the
Fifty-sixth Congress from the State of
Ttali. is ineligible to a seat In the Houee
of Representatives, and
â¢â¢Wherras, Such a Charge iÂ« made
through a member of the Hou.-m.- on his re
sponsibility v such member, and on the
basis, as he assert*, of public records, af
liilavli:. a:i<i papen evidencing such iru!l
gibility;
"Resolved, That the question of the
prima facie right of Brlghum H. Roberts
to be sworn In as a Representative be re
ferred to a special committee of nine
members of the House to be appointed by
the Speaker, and until such committee
shall report upon and the House decide
such question and right the Bald Brlgrham
EL Roberts shall not be sworn In or per
mitted to occupy a seat In this House;
and said committee shall have power to
send for persons and papers and examine
witnesses on oath In relation to the sub
ject matter of this resolution."
An agreement was then reached by
which consideration of the resolution
should be postponed until to-morrow after
the reading of the President's message.
The excitement thereupon Immediately
subsided nnd many of the spectators left
the galleries.
The officers of the House selected by the
Republican caucus last Saturday were
then elected. Alexander McDowell of

a short but lively debate by offering a
resolution for the adoption of the rules

Senator Perkins Now Ready to

The constitution provides that the Governor of a State shall have
power when, during the recess of the Legislature, any seat in the Senate
ehall by reason of death, resignation or from any cause become vacant,
to appoint a Senator to fiil the vacancy. So far as I know no vacancy
haÂ» occurred during the r:-cess of the Pennsylvania Legislature, and as I
read the constitution of thÂ« United States and as it has been interpreted
to us in the Senate by able constitutional lawyers the Governor cannot
appoint. None of the vacancies cither in Pennsylvania, California, Dela
ware or Utah occurred during 0 jecrss of the Legislature, and unless the
United States Senate reverses the precedents it has made in ninny other
ensfs it will held that the Governor, under the conditions existing in the
States I have named, cannot fill the vacancies. The Senate decided the
matter in the case of Mantle of Montana and Corbett of Oregon.â This

almost too early In the session to even

sincerely hope that we will bo able to

I would favor the cession of arid lands
to the several States under certain re
strictions. If my memory serves me cor
rectly, the State of California has prac
tically lost Its swamp and overflowed
lands, and comparatively little of this
land has been reclaimed. The cession to
States should be so guarded that only
actual settlers and homesteaders could
take up the land. I do not consider the

conclusion as to what will be done re
garding the Irrigation of arid lands in
California] but I am In hopes that at
10.-ist â  beginning may bo made by the
Government toward the final Irrigation of
all arid lands of th< Northwest. Our ex
perience of the past in the action of dif
ferent States for the irrigation of arid
lands, It seems to me. would not war
rant the ceding of these lands to Indi
vidual States. It seems to me better that
the Federal ' Government should under
take such work, and I believe that we
are warranted in the hope that the final
results v.-ould be much more satisfactory
than if ttfe work of irrigation should be
ttrtcen up by the States. I I do not believe
that such action by ihe Federal Govern
ment would be inconsistent with the for
mer policy of the United States, and a.-Â»
we have plenty of precedents, such as re
clamation of land by the building of
levees on the Mississippi and other rivers.
the Irrigation of arid lands would seem
to be as legitimate as the Improvement
of rivers and harbors, and subject us to
no more criticism of paternalism than
might be expected for the Improvement
of rivers and harbors. The main idea Is
to obtain a successful method, of Irri
gating arid lands in California, and it
seems to me that the Federal Govern
ment Is In the best position to accom
plish such result. I certainly shall fn
vor any action that may he taken in this
direction and sincerely hope that it maÂ»
be successful." >

up some lines In this work during tho

demand considerable attention. It Is too
early in the session to judge of the prob

bill. during the winter. I would undoubt

over rivers and harbors. I am particu

engineer department for this purpose. San
Diego Is one of the best harbors In the
world and II Is of growing Importance. 1
shall also endeavor to get a Sufficient ap
propriation to complete the San Diego
Quarantine station. This is important
considering the fact that an additional
line of steamers has recently been started
between this port and the Orient. I called
at th 3 Treasury Department yesterday
and succeeded in getting an order for the
revenue cutter Bear to winter In San
Diego. Assistant Secretary Spaulding in
formed me the department was thinking
of also having the Rush winter In San
Diego Bay. These vessels have been so
long in Alaskan" waters that it is neces

assignment of these ships to this locality
Is a recognition of the value of the har
bor of San Diego for this particular pur
pose. The Interior Department has rec
ommended the removal of the Indian
School now at Perris. Riverside County,
on account of a lack of water. I am anx

Riverside County, as there are many good
sites for It there. There are many aged and

take up this question and build storage
reservoirs. I don't think that a general
system of reservoirs will be built nt this
time, but work of national Irrigation will
be inaugurated. From my study of the
question I do not think It would be wise
to cede to the several States of the Union
the ari<Â£ lands. Remembering our experi
ence when swamp lands were .â â â¢: to
the States and the gigantic frauds perpe
trated, we do not. want to pass through
any such experience again. Ido not
think that the taking up of the work of
Irrigation by the Federal Government can
be Justly considered as a form of pater
nalism, inconsistent with the former pol

proper exercise of the power to make In

PRESS STILL PRATES OF
YANKEE SYMPATHY
LONDON, Dec. 4.â The afternoon papers
welcome the appointment of Adalbert F.
Hay as United State* Consul at Pretoria.
The St. Jumes Gazette says: "It Is by
numerous small indications other than by
striking outbursts that the real depth of
international sentiment can be gauged as
between the two great countries, who pre
fer making their sympathy plain to one
another to parading it before the world.
The appointment of Mr. Hay is one of
those small but significant important
signs by which the impartial observer can
test the sincerity of good feeling between
ourFflves and the United States."
The Westminster Gazette said: "If Mr.
Chamberlain is speaking to-day he will
undoubtedly turn to Mr. Hay's appoint
ment ah convincing proof that an alliance
exists. We do not make such a sweeping
deduction. It suffices to say it is picas
ant to think that our interests are repre
sented by one whose representations can
hardly fall to be received with considera
tion by the Transvaal."

MODDER RIVER BATTLE
NOT A BRITISH VICTORY
Methuen's Soldiers Mowed Down by the
Boer Fire and Held Back the
Entire Day.
LONDON, T>fc. 4. â The Daily Chronicle publishes the following dispatch,
dated Wednesday, November 29, morning, from 1*- < rr> spondent at Mod
der Klver camp:
"The severest engagement our column has yet had. and probably the
severest of the whole campaign, was foupht yesterday on the banks of
the Modder River. ThÂ«- battio wan v.ag<d fiercely for nearly fourteen hours.
The enemy occupied a strongly intrenched position, their front extending five
mil's ;t!onp the bank of the stream. They were well supplied with artillery and
fmiKht desperately.
"Our force consisted of the Second Battalion of the ColdMream Guards, the
Fir?'. Battalion of the Scots Guards, the Third Battalion of the Grenadier Guards,
th<^ First Battalion <>f the Northumberland Fusilirrs, the Second Battalion of
the Yorkshire LiÃht Infantry Che Kings Own), â  part of the First Battalion
nf the l^iyal North Lancashire Regiment, the Ninth I^incers, the mounted ln
fantry. thrco batt< ries of field artillery and the First Battalion of the Argyll and
Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise's). The lamr rÂ« iufnrced us from Gen
eral Wauchope's brigade, and arrived just In time for the fight.
"The battle itaited at daybreak, our guns shHllng the Boers 1 left. The enemy
replied with artillery. Hotchkiss and Maxims, and the artillery duel lasted some
hours. Th*>n there vat a brief lull In the enemy's operations, of which our gen
eral immediately took advantage.
"Tlif Infantry advanced across the plain toward tho river In two brigades.
The guard* >>n the right were met by an awful hail of bullets from the enemy's
FharjislM.oters. posted c los- t<> the rivor on the opposite side. Ours had no cover
Whatever, nnd wore simply mowed down. It seemed impossible to live through the
terrible tire, but the brave fellows did not retreat an Inch. The Boers' fire was
horribly accurate, and they must have numbered at leaM 10,000.
"The Bcotl Ottarda advanced fiiÂ¥) yards before they were fired on. Then they
ha/1 to Ho down to Â«-sc;i}m> the deadly fusillade, which lasted without Intermission
throughout thf day.
"Tlu- Highlanders made several attempts to force a passage of the river, but
they were expow-d to such a murderous enfilading fire that they had to retire,
â¢ > y had suffered terribly.
"Subsequently a party of the Guards got over and held their own for hours
against a vastly superior force.
"The general opinion of the staff Is that there had never been such a sustained
fire in the annals of th<- British army as that which <>ur troops had to face yester
day. our men fell in doseni while trying to rush the bridge.
"Among th<- many heroic deeds one <,f the most conspicuous was that of
Lieutenant Colonel Codrington of the Coldatnam Guards, Captain Sellpeln of the
Queensland contingent and a dozen members of the ("oldstream Guards, who
jumped into the rtVW and swam nearly to the other side In the face of a steady
Are, but were forced t<> retire, and. Joining hands, swam hack, two of their num
ber being nearly drowned In the retreat.
"The British guns kept up a heavy fire all day, and fearful havoc was wrought
on the Boer positions, the enemy being forced to flee from their intrenchments.
Night put an end to the terrible bloodshed. The infantry brigade was dreadfully
cut up.
"The Bo< rs retreated at night, taking their guns with them, and we are now
occupying their positions. The Â«nemy's k)M wai tremendous."
All the later details received from Modder River show that even the desperate
courage tho attacking force displayed all day long (November 2S) failed to drive
the Boers from their strong intrenchments. and night fell on an undecided
battle. But apparently during the course of the night General Cronje. com
manding the Boers, who are said to have numbered 11,000 men. decided that tho
struggle was hopeless, for the British found the town and surrounding positions
evacuated when daylight broke, and the whole British army crossed the river
and encamped on the Boer positions.
The experts here are unanimous In expressing the opinion that Klmberley's
needs must be very pressing to Induce General Methuen to expose the whole of
his command to the Boer marksmen, sngly Intrenched In a semi-circular po
sition. So deadly was the fire zone that the Scots Guards were compelled to leave
their Maxim guns behind when they were forced to seek less exposed gTound
It was only after dusk that a portion of the British troops succeeded In crossing
the river by a mllldam on the extreme left. When night fell the Boer ar
tillery was still as vigorous as In the morning, but the Boers' retirement In the
night saved the position for the British. The exhausted condition of the British
troops precluded the possibility of the pursuit of the enemy.
The conclusion of the correspondents that the Boers must have suffered
heavily must be confirmed from official sources before It is accepted as fact. la
any case the Boers retired without any sign of disorder, earning off their guns
and equipment. Thus General Cronjes force Is still intact. The fact that Gen
eral Methuen and Colonel KÂ»kewlch are now in communication may cause a re
consideration of the Boer commander's plan to give battle at Spytfonteln, where
he might be simultaneously attacked by both British forces.
It is reported that Modder River bridge has been repaired and that the Brit
ish resumed their march toward Klmberley to-dny.
The fact that the De Beers mill and foundry Is casting shells, while the gar
rison seldom replies to the Boors' artillery. Is said to point to a j-oarplty of am
munition at Kimberley. partially accounting for General Methuen's haste.
NEITHER BRITON NOR
BOER GAVE QUARTER
LONDON. Dec. s.â The correspondent of
the Associated Press with General Lord
Methuen's column, telegraphing from
Modder River last Thursday, says:
"ThÂ« Waterloo of the campaign has
been fought and won. The battle was
conducted with unprecedented stubborn
news on both sides. There was one con
tinuous roar, like the explosion of count
|CH firecrackers. There was no flinching
<>n either fide, and not a moment's pause.
"For live hours the British batteries
poured tons Â«f shrapnel and shells into
the Boer positions. Lord Methuen had
twenty-two guns and each fired an aver
age of 200 rounds. The Boers had an al
most equal number of guns, which, it Is
reported, were mostly served by French
ami liiTman artillerists.
"It is believed that the Boers had oc
cupied the position seven weeks before
and had spent the interval In fortifying
and rendering it, a* they considered, im
pregnable. They did not seem to fear to
spend their ammunition and their guns
were well and smartly handled.
"Owing to the bend In the river on the
jight the Boers had an opportunity of
cross-firing on the the British attack. A
Borr Hotchktss was directed with marvel- '
ous accuracy against a British Maxim, I
killing the sergeant In charge, wounding
an officer and disabling tho j^un. This oc
curred quite at the beginning of the en
gagement. Whenever the Boer fire was |
silenced In one direction it would Imme
diately be reopened in another.
"Owing to the terrific lire nobody on the
plain was out of range. Stretcher-bearers
found It impossible to go forward in the
few cases they were called upon to attend,
and the wounded were compelled. If pos
sible, to crawl out of the line*.
"No quarter seems to have been given
on either side. The British assert that
amid the bullets the ambulance wagons
dtaplagrtd their flags promiscuously to no
advantage. These were repeatedly driven
back and compelled to take refuge out of
sight.
"It Is alleged that the Boers used dum
dums and made especial targets of the
horses on the plain in the hope of hitting
the riders. While the Argyll Highlanders
were pushing across the river they were
fired upon from a house and several fell.
Thereupon the Highlanders stormed the
house, and although the Boers hoisted a
white flag n<> attention was paid to It and
all the Boers were shot.
"It Is reported that General Cronje,
with his contingent, retreated toward
Langeberg at 4 o'clock In the afternoon.
Others followed in the direction of Jacobs
<lahl and the main body of Boers retired
with the guns about 8 in the evening. On
the following morning at daybreak the
British flred a few pholls into the village.
Getting no response a patrol of cavalry
crossed the river and found the enemy's
camp deserted. Dead Boers and many
who were dying were to be seen every
where in the lntrenchments. as well as
numerous new graves. Several buildings
were in smoking ruins.
"Some of the Boer prisoners say that
General Cronje was in supreme command.
He had to whip his men to prevent them
deserting, and despite this many threw
down their rifles and fled."
BRITISH INFANTRY
COULD NOT ADVANCE
LONDON. Dec. s.â Julian Ralph, d?
srriblng In the Dally Mall this morning
the battle at Modder River, says:
"I can testify that the British never
once saw the enemy, yet they were not
able to raise hand or foot without being
riddl-d.
"Despite all this, however, the day be
longed to the artillery. The Infantry
never advanced two paces during this
day of hell. The shells of our twenty
guns were accurately planted in the
enemy's trenches and broke the hearts of
the Boers, for after dark they all re
treated."

LONDON. Dec. s.â The subjoined dis
patch from the Daily Telegraph's special
correspondent with Methuen's column,
although it reached Orange Rlvor at noon
on Thursday, did not arrive In London
until yesterday morning. Evidently It s
only a portion of his message, earlier sec
tions of which were not yet at hand.
The dispatch reads:
MODDER RIVER, Thursday. Now HO
(by train to Orange River).â On both
sides the losses in the engagement must
have been very heavy. So I wrote lafct
night before any returns were available.
This morning I found that the little tovin
by the river had been evacuated, the
Boers having moved off in the dark. Our
infantry has been marching to a position
on the left flank to repel any attack that
might be made from that direction, but
no Boers were about. The town had bofn
severely handled during the engagement.
I have found bullet holes In the walls
everywhere.
I learn that the enemy were 11. 090
Btrong, were under the command <>l
f'ronje and had many guns. The rilxty
second Battery of Royal Artillery
marched thirty-three miles from Belmoni
and went straight into action at 4 o'clock
In the afternoon. My horse was shot
under me during th" battle.
AMERICAN GOVERNMENT
MAY DECLARE NEUTRALITY
WASHINGTON. Dec. 4-Presldent Mc-
Klnley and Secretary Hay still have under
consideration the advisability of issuing a
proclamation declaring the neutrality of
the L'nlted States In the war between the
South African Republic and the Orange
Freo State and Great Britain. None of
the powers of Continental Europe have
issued such a proclamation, and until they
i do fo it is doubtful If the I'nlted States
will act. The slowness of foreign Gov
ernments in taking such action has been
j a matter of some speculation in official
circles, but is presumed to grow out of
the fact that hitherto they have okparvsd
neutrality and they see no reason why
they should formally announce, their at
titude.
During the American-Spanish war Ger-
I many did not issue a proclamation of neu
, trallty. though she remained neutral, but
in diplomatic circles it is recalled that her
attitude at Manila was not very friendly
and her failure to tssue the proclamation
left her free to act as she saw tit. These
considerations may actuate other powers
of Europe in failing to issue a neutrality
proclamation fan the case of the South
African war. This Government stands
re.-xly. however, not only to strictly nb
| serve the laws of neutrality but to issue
a proclamation should such a course swm
advisable.
Official announcement was made at the
State Department to-day of the anpolnt
| ment of A. S. Hay, son of the Secretary
of State, as <*onsul of the I'nlted States to
Pretoria, to succeed Mr. Macrum. who
will be relieved upon the arrival of his
successor. Mr. Hay will start for his post
next wâ¬ek, armed with the fullest instruc
tions both ns to treatment of matters de
veloping In connection with American citl
rens as well as matters relating to British
prisoner* and British interests. Mr. Hay
will gn to PretOfta via Tendon, but it is
not certain that he will visit the British
Foreign Office.
Mr. Hay's appointment Is a matter of
much satisfaction in British diplomatic
circles here, and It is not doubted by the
President that the Boer Cinvernment will
express similar gratification upon Mr.
Hay's reception by the Boer Government.
Webster Davis, Assistant Secretary of
the Interior, left here last night for a trip
to South Africa. He will sail from New
York on Wednesday morning :ind bo away
three months. During the trip he expects
to pay a visit to Pretoria. Mr. Davis"
Journey Is entirely unofficial and has no
connection with this Government.
BRITONS APPALLED AT
THEIR HEAVY LOSSES
LONDON, Dec. 6.â There is a feeling of
disappointment and a continuing: anxiety
respecting General Lord Methuen. The
TimeÃ says editorially:
"The battle of Modder River affords
splendid proof of the unsurpassed quÃll
tles of the British soldier, but while vic
tories won solely by the exercise of there
qualities are indeed magnificent, they are
not war. They fill us with pride, hut
with pride not unmixed with regret at
the persistent perversity of circumstances
which, apparently, prevents us obtaining
equal or greater results by processes
savoring a little of that military science
of which we hear bo much."

SUPREME COURTS
BLOW AT TRUSTS
Decides Against the Constitution 3
ality of the Pipe Manufac=
turers' Combine.
WASHINGTON. Vor. 4. -In the United
States Supreme Court to-day the Addy
stone pipe case was decided. Thi-
Involved the constitutionality of the com
bination of pipe manufacturers which. It
wan charged, was a trust. The decision
was handed down by Justice I*. kham,
and was adverse to the combination. It
was therefore in opposition to Urn trust.
The opinion of the Court of Ajifn als for
the sixth circuit was affirmed.
In revl. wing the case. Justl< c Perkham
said that it had been brought under the
anti-trust act of IX9O. and that an in
junction was asked for to enjoin the cor
porations engaged In the man.ufact
water and gal pipe which composed the
combination from continuing business un
dÂ«-r the agreement by which they h;i-l Â«1 i
vlded the territory of the I'nlted States
among HlWlllâ I MÂ». -and by which they
bad arranged to fix prices.
I'nder this agreement the members of
Urn combination provid'-d for auctioning
off the right to make bids for supplying
with pip.- citlis not allotted territory, the
successful bidder to meet no opposition
from other members of the trust; or. If
other Mda were madb. none of them
should b.- higher than thnt of th* com

bids were asked for in territory ai
to members of th< territory, the agree
ment wai that DO bids should be made
except under the supervision of tbo a m
pany in charge of that territory under the

Tin charge was that Â»ueh a combina
tion wax a violation of the clause of the
constitution regulating Interstate com
nvr<c. The IM-trict Court in which the
case was first beard refused to take this
vi. -w ..f it. tnit it was reversed by the
Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit,
which held the combination to be antag
onistic to the constitution, ordering the
guns on Pulwana Hill, which has thus
far been thrlr-e silenced."

VAN ALEN FAILS TO
ASSIST THE BRITISH
LONDON, Dec. 4.â J. Van Alen. the
American millionaire, nan had an unsuc
cessful experience. It se,ems, in attempt-
Ing to render aid to the British wounded
In South Africa. He first offered the War
Office an ambulance, fully equipped, to
the extent of Â£10.000. to be officered and
manned by the English army, on condi
tion that he be allowed to accompany It
to the front. The "War Office replied, ask
ing In what capacity he could go, and
this produced the offer from Mr. Van
Alen to go in any capacity, however mod
est. The War Office was compelled to de
cline.
Mr. Van Al^n then offered the ambu
lance to the Maine hospital ship commit
tee. The latter, finding the ambulance
adapted to land uses only, consulted with
thÂ»' War Office and eventually Inform^ 1
Mr. Van Alen that the committee would
be triad to take him to South Africa as a
guest, but that on arriving at Cap.- Town
It would be necessary to turn him and thÂ«
ambulance over to the army. In which
evrnt the two would became a hospital
section, possibly having to remain In
Cape Town.
Mr. Van Alen refused to become a mere
hospital MCtlOll and withdn-w his offer.
His main object. It is bellfved, was to
get to the front, and It is thought that
he had no special desire to do hospital
work excrpt in that circumstance. An
unconfirmed report is In circulation that
he will make a similar offer to the Boers.

Committee. . â¢. :
BERLIN. Dec. 4.â The Reichstag to-dar
discussed the Government's currency bill
{ providing for an Increase of silver coins
until the amount reaches the proportion
1 of fourteen marks per head of the popu

1 perative, adding that other pieces would
at the same time be withdrawn from cir

Imported 40.000.U00. and in 1Â£99. up to Sep

Regarding the maintenance of the sold
standard and the stoppage of the gold
output of South Africa, he asked what
would be the result If the war lasted
longer than a year. Ilerr We!tzÂ°len. Con
servative, remarked that the Boers were
not only gallant defenders of their lib

deposits, and might cut off much of Ger

Hcrr Koch, director of the Reichstag,
pointed out that all thÂ« great states had

Dr. Arendt. secretary of the German Rl

that there was absolutely no prospect of

SEEKING COMPANY
Trying to Prevent the Return of Un-
opened Letters Sent to the
Franklin Syndicate.
NEW YORK. Dec. 4.â lt 13 expected
that a petition will be made by attorneys
claiming to represent a large number of
depositors who were caught In the Frank
lin Syndicate crash to Judge Thomas of
the United States Court, enjoining Post
master Wilson of Brooklyn from return-
Ing to the senders the mass of letters sup
posed to contain a large amount of funds
received In his office since the collapse of
the syndicate and held there by moan:; of
a fraud order from the Government pro
hibiting the delivery of mall to Miller's
concern. The motion will be based on an
affidavit giving the fist of an interview
with Postmaster General Wilson. In
which he Is said to have set tho value of
the money-bearing letters now in the pos
session of the P<wÂ«tofnce Department at
from $75,000 to $100,000. with an average of
$20,000 coming in each' day.
It will be urged that the senders of
money by mail did, by so sending, become
creditors of the concern known as the
Franklin Syndicate and are therefore en
titled only to such share of it* assets as
a regularly appointed receiver, acting
under the bankruptcy laws of the United
States, shall be able to distribute to them.
The attorneys for the depositors claim
that the United States postal authorities

INDIANAPOLIS. Dec. 4.â Ex-President

"Overtures have been made to me by
persons connected with the league, but
they were merely tentative. I was asked
If I could assist the league. 1 replied
that my time (I having Just returned

me to go Into the case. The matter was
not pressed."
"What is your opinion of the case?"
"As for myself. i share with the whole
country the feeling that to allow a man
who is living with plural wives to sit In

HOW CONVICTS
SMUGGLE OPIUM
Drug Cleverly Concealed
on Their Persons.
to The Call.
SAN QUENTIN PRISON, Dec. 4.â ln
their desperate efforts to smuggle opium
and morphine Inside the prison walls the
convicts have resorted to methods that
have caused the officials amazement, ac-
customed as they are to exhibitions of
Ingenuity on the part of the prisoners In
the endeavor to obtain their regular sup
ply of the baneful drug: Warden Agulrre
has lately been kept keenly on the alert
and has succeeded in baffling the plans
of the "fiends" and their accessories, with
the result that large 'quantities of opium
have been seized within two weeks, the
value of which will aggregate more than
$1000.
About two weeks ago the Warden found
a quantity of opium, worth nearly lIOUQ,
cached near San Clemente, where the
"road gang" has been at work on the
Tlburon boulevard. It was put up in such
a manner that the men could easily con
ceal it on their persons.
Last Saturday evening, as the same
gang of prisoners was passing the Ward
en's office on the way to their cells, he
noticed one of the convicts throw his right
hand carelessly about. As all prisoners
are under orders to keep their hands
clasped, t^iis movement excited the offi
cial s suspicion. He ordered the gardener
to make â  search. A small quantity â¢â¢*
opium, done in in tinfoil, the package
being of the circumference of a 25-cent
piece and about three times as thick, was
found. A watch was kept ami a box of
these packages was unearthed where It
had been cached near the line of the bou
levard. There was enough opium in the
box to be worth POO. The man who threw
his arms about was placed in a strait-
Jacket, and on the second day of his
punishment confessed that the package.*
had been made of a size convenient to
hold in the mouth and that â  few of them
had been smuggled inside the prison be
fore the Warden discovered the trick.
Further investigations have discovered
the fact that the convicts have been car
rying opium through the gates in small
quantities by gluing small packages un
der the armpits beneath their clothing. A
copy of an Eastern paper was examined
the other day and found to contain a
goodly quantity of morphine. The con
victs are not allowed to read coast papers,
hut the mailing of Eastern publications
to them by their friends is permitted.
hero the different sheets of this particu
lar paper had been glued together the
space glued was an inch broad, and be
tween the two lines of the mucilage was
contained the morphine.
Since these discoveries the Warden has
issued orders that every convict work
ing outside the walls shall be stripped
and searched before being allowed inside
the gates. This innovation began yester
day, and a startling discovery was made
on the occasion of the first search. One
of the convicts had been supplied with a
pah* of artificial pads for the calves of
his legs, and enough opium was found in
side the pads to have supplied the prison
for a week.
"We have kept a close watch on the
smugglers." said "Warden Aguirre to-day,
"and are confident that we nave discov
ered who is supplying or trying to sup
ply the 'fiends' with the drug. He Is an
ex-convict named James Harrison, who

make them feel' that the risk of smug
gling is too great for the continuance of
the practice."

NEW FRATERNITY HOUSES.
Sororities Will Erect Two Handsome
Building-s at Stanford.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Dec. 4-
Two new fraternity houses will soon bÂ«
added to those already built on LftMMfl
street, the avenue which Mrs. Stanford
has designated as her "fraternity row."
The curious part Is that both parties who
are planning to build are Sororities, or girl
fraternities, as they choose to be called.
The Delta Gammas will probably begin
building llrst. as they already have an
architect engaged In drawing up plans.
and active work will commence shortly
after the beginning of the new year.
The other party of ambitious girls Is
the newly formed Alpha Phi Sorority.
Though they only received their charter
from the national fraternity last May
they are already one of the largest and
strongest of the girls' organizations .it
Stanford. It is rumored that their house
la to be the most elaborately planned of
any of the fraternity houses on the -.m
pus. Work will commence within a few
months, as the location Is definitely set

Next Year's Captain.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Dee. 4 â
The football men will meet next Thursday
night to elect a captain to lead them next
year. Burnett's Is the only name men
tioned for the place, and It Is likely that
the giant tackle will be unanimously
elected on the first ballot. He Ik the only
player with the credit of having played In
two Thanksgiving game* who will be in
college next year. This. together with
the fact that he Is a general favorite with
his fellows, makes him the logical candi
date for this the greatest of all college
honors.

Mr. Ellis waived his hand In assent and
after a short talk with Augustus Wilson
of Louisville, the attorney acting for the*

around, remarking:
"1 will waive the point. Mr. Ellis: her*

This was practically the only argument

FIREBUGS AT
WORK IN NAPA
Torch Applied to Many
Buildings.
Â«
Sj*clal Dispatch to The Call.
NAPA. Dec. 4.â Firebugs were rating
In this city Sunday night, and an attempt
was made to destroy the Central Public
School building, a handsome structure,
situated In the center of the city, by ap
plying the torch to the â oath side of
it. I: was an unsuccessful attempt, how
ever, and the fire Beads' efforts were frus
trated by the prompt action of the Fire
Department. The department was called
Into service three times In as many hours
and the entire population of the city mi
aroused to excitement because of the
great rapidity with which tires were being
started m different parts of town.
The llrst alarm was rung In at about C:3)
p. m. The lire was discovered to be in the
loft of E. Bigg's barn on Randolph street.
It had gained no headway an. l was qulck-
Iv extinguished by the lire laddies. The
firemen had Just housed their apparatus
, when a second alarm was turned in. The
scene of the blaze was at the school build
1 ing. The tire had been started in a wooden
box that was lying outside on the south
side of the building. It whs discovered
by a llreman who was returning home,
and he quickly extinguished it before any
damage resulted.
At :15 o'clock the third alarm again
brought the Fire Department Into service.
A stable, the property of George Head Sr..
a bush. m.in of Napa, was discovered
to be ablaze. A valuable horse was
burned, but the fine dwelling of Mr Head,
only a few feet from the names, was
saved by the hard work of the firemen.
Excitement by this time among the people
had reached a high pitch, and there was
no doubt that the tire tlend was at work.
The Sheriff and local Constables at once
set out to investigate the mysterious
cause, and to-day were able to find a
clew.
Enough evidence has been secured from
many prominent citizens who saw a man
' running away from the schoolhoose after
he had set the flre there. The individual
was seen later running up Callstoga av
enue. The ofllcers are confident that they
will land the guilty party behind prison
bars In a day or two, as there nave been
, several mysterious characters hanging
around town for the last few days.

was victorious in each, but through the
treachery of members of my Cabinet, and
particularly of my Vice President, the
insurgents were allowed to approach the
capital Knowing that If they once en
tered the city all nope would be gone, and
deciding that the most patriotic act I
j could do would be to leave the country.
i I did so. thus preventing the unnecessary
bloodshed of my faithful and patriotic fol
lowers.
"Since I have been In San Juan a part
of Cnstro's following has deserted film.
I and. under Jose Hernandez, alias "I>a
Hoc*,' a revolution within a revolution
has been started. I have foreseen this
state of affairs, and It will be years before
the country will become settled. Venezu
; ela is now on the verge of anarchy. Up.
risings will occur here and there" every

schooner Coqullle of Empire City, 25 days
from Coqutlle river, badly In need of provi
sions; was given a liberal supply of flour,
potatoes, meat, sugar and coffee, also oil.
Matter reported schooner leaking some, but
did not consider it dangerous, and required
no further assistance.
Latitude 40 degrees 17 minutes north, lon

Latitude 40 degree* 7 minutes north, longi
tude l.'i degree* 17 minutes west, kpoke
schooner Letttla of San Francisco, 23 days
from Grays Harbor; master requested pro
visions, and his wants were supplied. See-
Ing that there wan a woman on board the
Letltla, the officers Of the MeCulloch made
up a bundle of magazines and papers, among
them reveral copies of The Call, and sent
them in the boat to the distressed vessel,
ami they were much appreciated by the
plucky wife of the captain, who had aeoom
tutnled him on his perilous voyage.
latitude 40 decrees l minute north, longi
tude 125 degrees 16 minute* went. upoke
schooner Seven Sisters of San Francisco, 14

but desired no assistance.
December 4â Three miles south of the
South Farralon, spoke schooner Rio Hey of
San Francisco. 3 days' from Eureka- all
well.
None of these vessels from northern ports
had heard anything of or had seen the
schooners Amethyst or Danielson, so long
overdue, nor hail they seen any vessels In
distress or requiring assistance. Had light
northwest weather, with clear skies until
this morning; long southwesterly swell and
smooth sea.
During the cruise of the McCulloch a
most vigilant outlook was kept night and
day and every sail that hove In Bight
wan spoken. \ cry grave fears are felt for
the American Girl. Amethyst. Antelope
and S. Danlelson. The Amethyst and
Danielson have been spoken and supplied
with provisions, but that was peveral
weeks ago. and the crews of all four
schooners must be In desperate straits
by this time. There Is always the chance
that some vessel better supplied with
stores may have relieved their pressing
wants, which fact will not be known un
til one or the other of the vessels makes
port. For instance, the steamer Grace
Dollar arrived at Grays Harbor Sunday
and reported speaking the schooner Vo
lantc. 30 days out from San Francisco
for Coqullle River, short of provisions
and supplied her wants. The Volante
was off Cape Foulweathcr when spoken.
Some of the coasters now out from six
to fifteen days may have spoken some of
the overdues In a similar manner and
given them a share of their stores. Nev
ertheless many of the old ship captains
are of the opinion that the sailors are
faring like the men on the Wing and
Wing were when spokenâ living on sea
gulls.
The boat picked up by the steamer Geo
Loomls turns out to belong to the Naval
Reserve at Santa Cruz. It was washed
out of the davits during the southeaster
and carried to sea. The boat was origi
nally a man-of-war cutter and was not
much damaged by its battle with the ele
ments.
The Oregon Railway and Navigation
Company's steamer George W. Elder
sailed for Portland yesterday In com
mand of Captain Clem Randall. As the
vessel passed along the front every tow
boat on the bay saluted Captain Ran
dall. The new master of the Elder was
formerly captain of the tug Relief and
this is his first command of a passenger
steamer.
Rafael Rahos, a fireman on the steamer
San Bias, was nearly asphyxiated at 301
Montgomery street Sunday night. He
went to his room drunk and turned the
gas out and then on again. He was
nearly dead when Officer C. Peters found
him. Rahos was taken to the Harbor
Hospital, where Dr. Morrison worked
over him for an hour and gave Rafael a
new lease of life. He will be able to so
out on his steamer.
The United States training ship Adams,
which returned from a cruise to Seattle
a few days ago, went to Mare Island yes
terday. The battle-ship lowa went out
side during the morning.
The transport Sherman will sail to
morrow with the third battalion of the
Forty-ninth Regiment and 150 recruits.
Chief Steward Robinson Is sick, so J. J.
Fallon. formerly of the St. Paul, will 50
out In his piece. Mr. Fallon and his
crew made a mcdel transport out of the
St. Paul, hut unfortunately he had a
private difference with the first assistant
engineer and refused to sign with him.
Every one of his assistants also refused
to go out on the ship and a new set of
men had to be procured. Mr. Fallon and
all hands stayed by the St. Paul up to the
hour of sailing and helped the new
comers In every possible manner to got
acquainted with the ship. Mr. Fallon left
the St. Paul with the good-will of ercry
member of the Alaska Commercial Com
pany and all of them are glad to see him
appointed to the Sherman. Many of the
ola St. Paul men will go out with him on
the Sherman. - '/.,. : ~ ' ;

FATHER M'KINNON'S
FINAL STATEMENT
OAKLAND. Dec. 4 ChaskaJa Father
McKlnnon. who leaves to-morrow to re
sume his post of duty In the Philippines
as a chaplain In the regular army, de
livered his farewell lecture to-night at
St. Francis de Sales Hall In Oakland. He
was received In a most cordial manner
and by an unusually large audience, and
he made his la.xt statements in th.
troversy thai lia- arisen ..v.-r thÂ«- chnrge
that the I'iilted States volunteers looted
the churches of the islands.
His Interesting lecture, accompanied
profusely by â tereoptieon views, was on
"The Conditinns an.i <'harac-terlstlcu In
the Philippines," and mi for the most
part the samr he has delivered In several
other rlti.-s. touching briefly the history
of the war and many steMS and Incident*
he wlUWllli at the front; dwelling also
upon the resources of the archipelago;
the character of the natives and their In
stitutions ami what may be tatpm led
through future development.
"With a |OOd ttberal American Govern
ment." said Father McKlnnon. "these
Island* can be made the most valuable
on the face of the earth." in his conclud
ing remarks he dosed the Funston church
looting controversy. "Frequently I have
been asked the question now long the
war in the Philippines will last." said the
speaker, "and. as 1 stated on my return
from the Islands, the war was almost over
then. The criticisms I heard are most
unjust. Nowhere has a soldier striven
harder to achieve victory than ha* Oen
er.il Otis. Niw that he has a sufficient
number of troops he has succeeded, and It
will only h. i -hort time before the war
will terminate.
"Regarding the reports of churches des
ecrated. 1 say again that it Is an undenia
ble fact that where ehurchei irere dese
crated and looted such outrages cannot be
laid at the (< et of the American soldiers
This looting was chiefly the work of In
surgents and Chinese. I was in most of
the battles; my eyes wen- wide opÂ«>n: I
had the interest of my church at heart
and I received particular orders from the
generals to tee that the churches w.-i.
not looted. Whatever I found In these
edifices I placed In the sacristy and a
guard was put there.

The generals did their utmost to pre
vent all looting, and the American Gov
ernment and army are not to blame It
Is to be expected that there arc alway*
some who have not the higher sense of
duty but I will say without fear of con
tradiction that less of that work was dona
by the American army than by any army
that .-â¢â â¢ fought a foreign foe.
"As to the church of t.'alnocan. I found
this church occupied by Insurgent* *Â» .
barracks. They hail occupied It since Au
gust 13, and remained until the rupture on
hebruary 7. 1 found they had removed
statues and nearly every sacred article.
A three-Inch gun had been mounted In thu
place, and It looked more like a fortTCU
than a church.
"There Is one charge â the chargo
against one of the bravest and noblÂ«-*t
generals In the armyâ I hope the sensible
people of this State and country will not
credit, for 1 place no confidence in the
charge against General Frederick Fun
Â«tcm. General FunÂ»t< was broad-minded
and liberal to a fault, lligotry found mi
place In his composition. Knowing him
a " Ââ¢ l S eei aggrieved, more than I ran
explain, that charge* xhould bÂ»Â» brought
nrainst one of the bravest and most fear
less generals of the army.
"How some of the editors open their
mouths like ducks and -.wallow every
story of church looting that Is told passes
beyond my comprehension.
"No matter whether you thought tho
war ju.Â«t or unjust, these bravo men gave
up their dully vocations, went there lo
fight for their flag, and they rirÂ«<er\v h*t
tor treatment than they hnve received n
your hands. While you were enjoylnjr
peace at home they were undergoing
trials and hardships abroad.
"After witneaslnx the cloning ficen-si of
many brave lives there. It grieves me to
hear harsh criticisms at home WÂ»-e it
not for 'he criticism indulged in at Some

THE ISTHMIAN CANAL
CONCURRENTLY with the re-examination of
l the Nicaragua canal and with the attempt oi
Mr. Hepburn to pass a bill appropriating $115,
000.000 for its construction comes the report oi Â«i
French commission on the Panama canal and its
route. '
This French report raises a new question entirely
which may be well worth examination. The French
commission has studied the track of the severe earth
quakes which visit the isthmus and commends the
Panama route as being away from the line of fracture
along which runs that profound disturbance which
oestroyed the cities of Leon and Granada, The re
port states that the Nicaragua route lies on that frac
ture. It is easily seen that a canal within the line of
jireat earthquake disturbance is in peril of destruction
of such parts of it as to render investment in its con
struction very risky. Of course there may be noth
ing in this French contention, but this should be
demonstrated before the very imposing sum necessary
is invested in the work. Perhaps this French report
is intended to lead to a proposition that we purchase
the Panama canal.
The report say* that to complete that canal will re
quire an expenditure of 51.2,000,000 francs, or $102,
400,000. This is a surprise to those unfamiliar with
the whole plans and with the extent to which the
work has been pushed. Three thousand men are now
engaged on it, and if increased to a force of twelve
thousand the work can be completed in ten years.
If all these climates and statements are correct it
would appear likely that the construction will be
well toward completion before we pet started on the
Nicaragua project at the rate we arc going now.
Admiral Walker's commission has informed our
Government that it cannot report until December,
1000. So that no . tilling can possibly be nearer
than two years from this time, wMci exhausts one
fifth of the time estimated for completing the Panama
ditch.
It is understood that Mr. Hepburn admits that
there is no prospect of his bill passing at this session,
so it if not probable that there will be any action
in advance of the report of the Walker commission.
ft is within probability that before that report is
made we will hear of propositions to purchase and
finish the French work. In this view it is well that
those interested begin to investigate that work and to
estimate its probable value.

While there may be many causes of earthquakes,
including electricity, they are no longer quite the
mystery they were. It seem? to be settled that when
an upraise in the earth's crust is in progress a fracture
therein causes a slip on one side. When the upraise
goes on a long time before the slip the side that
falls has farther to fall to reach equilibrium, and the
destruction of course is greater. Our California!)
earthquakes are not very destructive because of their
frequency. There being many slips the BUSS does
not decline very far.
In the Eastern States the New Madrid and Charles
ton earthquakes seem to demonstrate a long con
tinued upraise and an infrequent slip with very ap
palling consequence*.

Brail rest
The South African press censor has been guilty of
another slip of the pen. A week ago he had General
Joubert traveling in â  hearse. Now the distinguished
Boer is hustling through the country in an omnibus.
Whatever he may be traveling in he seems to be very
much alive, "-XiS
THE AFRICAN ISSUE.
THE ghastly death roll of the Boer war length
*idl each day. Mr. Jo Chamberlain is
opening bii mouth frequently and putting
his foot in it every opening. Mr. Choatc and the rest
who represent and misrepresent both Eng
' land and America are saying their several says, but
i nothing has occurred to justify England's assault on
! the two republics, and nothing can justify any warmth
toMrd her in the matter from any official source in
-Uiitry. As we have said before, Mr. Chambcr
>nd Cecil Rhodes succeeded admirably in con
| the mind of the world as to England's suzerain
tl in the Transvaal. Those rights were practi
boi i-.ttle more than the United States would
have under the Monroe doctrine. The Transvaal was
limply barred From making treaties with foreign m
â¢ the approval of Great Britain. Mr.
Chamberlain has stretched this sole right into a claim
I that England was suzerain in the internal affairs of
vaal. and coutii therefore rightfully demand
changes in the d<>r i tatotes of naturalization,
even to the extent ; Croat Britain
a Transvaal franchise without forswearing their al
legiance to her.
The awful bloodshed in the war is in behalf of this
claim. For that the murder of the two republics is
proposed. Foe that the attempt is made to array the
Strong with the strong, the mighty with the mighty.
-t the weak to tk>-tr<>y them. For that it i - '
in European capitals that the people of this republic
rafall of the republics in South Africa.
The claim is a lie, and it is the most pitiful sight
c century to sec brave men dying on the veldt
in defense of a lie.
Mr. John Hays Hammond has appeared in this

THE KAISER AMD THE BRITISH-
AP.'U'T the time public attention in Great
Britain was ' idl
ing : . r a race was run at the
November Derby in which a horse hearing the name
â ; Chamberlain beat another horse named Ger
manicus. and. according to the Westminster Gazette,
a number c an interest in politics
I drew from the victory the conclusion that
in the diplomatic n< - that would be carried
ring 1 I the imperial Germanicus, the
â¢ . 'me tin- best of Joseph Chamber
bin. -. I now the most conspicuous figure in
â 
Without considering how far it may be possible to
â¢ liplomacy by thr results of horse races it is
â¢ ;ig that the return of the Kaiser to Ger
hai been followed immediately by an address
from Chamberlain frankly declaring that Great Brit
; no longer remain isolated in Europe, and
that her natural alliance is with Germany. He spoke
with 'â¢â¢'me warmth of an "understanding" with the
I'ni: Si n<i then added: "I can foresee many
things in the future which must cause anxiety to the
: urope, but in which our i::tere<ts are
clearly the same a* Germany's, and in which the un
whieh I have spoken with reference
â¢ ii extended to Germany, do more
pi than any combination of arms to preserve
the peace of the world."
Such a speech on such an occasion is sure to give
rise to a tl of speculation concerning the
motive that prompted it and the understanding that
i' back of it. The Kaiser's visit to Great Britain was
:sly set forth as a private visit to the
Queen. The world was informed again and again
that the German Emperor was going to London
! solely because of a yearning to see his grandmother.
v noted, however, that he was accompanied by
â¢ \ â¢ : ; â¢. and diplomatists wondered what
the Count would be doing while the Kmperor wab
talking to his grandmother about the children or to
his uncle the Prince of Wales about pigeon shooting.
That the British believe they have it in their power
to make an alliance with them of more value to Ger
many than any other the Kaiser can arrange is made
abundantly evident by the tone of their press. The
\aniple, recently said: "Ger
many d"cs not want to see France in possession of
.\!ur.>cco, or Russia made pre-eminent in Turkey.
If. then, we were to say to Germany: 'If you refuse
to hi HOW wt- shall let France take Morocco,
1 sod allow Russia to dominate all Asiatic Turkey;
â¢l stand by us we will secure Aria
Minor to you, and it France fights us will give you
an^ your Italian allies all Northern Africa from th
â¢laic Peninsula t< Cape Spartel (i. c., the whole
.cm coast of the Mediterranean) as a colonial
empire." Germany could hardly refuse. In a word,
;; France and Russia were to a>k for 'compensation'
of a kind which we thought unreasonable we could
rrithont difficulty make offers to the Triple Alliance
which would put Germany. Austria and Italy on our
:i.lc."
The Mtuation iÂ« in every respect an interesting one.
It was nnly â  little while apro that pood reasons were
by experts to prove that the ambition of the
K:ii>er is to form an alliance with France Â«o as to
make something like a union of all Western Europe
strong enough to hold off Russia on one side and
Great Britain and the United States on the other.

I in considering the crooked course of European dip
lomacy, it is just as well to draw conclusions from
, horse races as from anything else.
THE Wf?R REVENUE ACT.
OWING to the excellent condition of the Fed
eral treasury and the prospect of a speedy end
to the war in the Philippines some authori
ties on national revenues are of opinion that when
Congress undertakes the revision of the war tax law
it will be found expedient to eliminate from it a good
many of the more vexatious and burdensome of the
taxes.
It is noted that since the act was passed the rev
enues derived from it have rapidly increased with the
increasing prosperity and business activity of the
country. The receipts under the act were for the
fiscal year closing last June about $470,000,000, against
$320,000,000 for the previous year, and every month
t.f the present year shows an increase over those of
last year. This increase, taken in connection with the
fact that the Government has not expended the sum
obtained by the war loan of 1898, has given the treas
ury ample money for immediate use. and it is there
fore argued the war taxes might well be diminished.
A writer for the New York Sun suggests that the
Government without much loss of revenue might
drop the little stamp taxes which are of considerable
annoyance to the public but yield comparatively small
income to the treasury. Among these he includes the
taxes on proprietary medicines, chewing gum, bottles
; of wine, telegraph and telephone messages and ex
press receipts, checks and bills of exchange. Of
the two last-named taxes the writer says: "The re
ceipts from this source, under the act repealed in
1577, were not separately reported, but at most they
could not have been more than $1,000,000 or $2,000,
000 a year, and they are probably not much greater
now. The imposition of taxes on checks discourages
the keeping of bank accounts, which ought rather to
be promoted, and requiring them for bills of ex
change is a burden on commerce which it is bad
policy to retain."
It will certainly be gratifying to have the war
taxes lightened at the time the law is revised, and
with most of the suggestions made the public will
a^jree It is not desirable, however, that any tax
should be repealed which has given rise to a question
of law if by the repeal the issues be terminated without
In ing decided by the courts. The controversy be
tween the people and the express companies, for ex
sfnple, as to whether the companies or the shippers
are bound to iffix the stamp to the express receipt,
ought not to be summarily disposed of by abolishing
the tax. Ever since the law was put into effect the
express companies have compelled the public to pay
the tax. Suit after suit has been brought to test the
and ilciM<ion after decision has been given for
the plaintiffs against the corporations, and at last
the people are in sight of victory. It is therefore not
, desirable that the express tax should be repealed this
winter. That fight should be carried to a finish and
1 nothing should be done to relieve the corporations of
the duty of paying taxes just as the courts are about
to compel them to do so after two years of shirking.
For the rcÂ«t the suggestions made with respect to
repealing the lesser taxes are pood. The tax on bot
tles of wine, for instance, \-- grossly unjust, since it
i- as heavy on a bottle of table claret as on one of
the costliest brand. There are other taxes equally
unfair, and all such should be repealed.
THE PROPOSED NAVfIL PROGRAMME.
SECRETARY LONG'S recommendations con
cerning the programme of ne*r vessels to h:
constructed for the navy will reawaken the ol<l
controversy over the comparative merits of battle
ships and cruisers The Secretary, following the
recommendations of the Xaval Hoard of Construc
tion, requests Coi ure-s to provide for the building
of three armored cruisers of about 13.000 tons trial
displacement, three protected cruisers of about 8000
tons and twelve gunboat- of about 900 tons. It will
be seen that not a single battle ship is asked for.
The advocates of battle ships point to the expe
rience of our navy in the Spanish war as an argument
for that class of wai The record of the Ore
gon in her voyage a: rand the Horn proved the
American battle-ship, at any rate, is a good sea
poing vessel and therefore can perform much of the
duty of a cruiser, \\h â¢ a cruiser cannot be counted
OH to take the place of a battle-ship in a hard fight.
In fact, it is asserted the United States is really a
battle-ship nation, since her navy has been first to
show the world what battle-ships can do in the way
of making long voyages and of destroying hostile
fleets, and that to turn away now from the battle
ship type is to be to some extent false to the records
of our own hisory.
There can be no question of the soundness of these
statements. During the Spanish war our battle
ships completely refuted the predictions of those who
declared they would be uiim aworthy, and thoroughly
justified all the most sanguine expectations of their
supporters. It may be fairly said they overthrew
every argument urged against them and confirmed
all that had been said in their favor. It is therefore
a matter of some surpri-e that neither the Board of
Construction nor the Secretary of the Xavy recom
mends the building of even as much as one at this
time.
It is to be noted, however, that the cruisers pro
posed by the programme are to be much more for
midable than the largest now afloat and will hardly
be inferior to battle-ships. In tonnage displacement,
in fact, they will exceed the battle-ships. The largest
of our armored cruisers now afloat, the Brooklyn, baa
a displacement of only 9215 (ons, and even the battle
ships Maine, Missouri and Ohio will not equal the
proposed cruisers in that respect. The Oregon, for
example, has a displacement of but 10.228 tons
against the 13.000 tons of the armored cruisers which
the Secretary recommends.
The controversy over the relative merits of the
two classes of ships is one which experts will continue
to carry on indefinitely. The public will be satisfied
with the judgment of the Board of Construction and
the Secretary. The new vessels will add greatly to
our naval strength, and, wliile they will not carry as
heavy batteries as battle-ship^, their offensive power
will nevertheless be formidable. They will have great
speed and coal endurance, and their guns will be
heavier than any our cruisers have hitherto carried.
The most significant feature of the programme is the
illustration it gives of the rapidity with which the
size of war ves-d- is increasing. When cruisers are
constructed with a displacement of 13.000 tons it h
certain that the next battle-ships will have at least
15,000 tons displacement and be floating fortress
in magnitude and armament as well as in name.
After bÂ«ring of the overwhelming opposition to
himself in the House of Representatives- Congreta
man Roberts is inclined to the belief that the members
have prejudiced the case against >im. Perhaps he
would have been closer to the mark if he had said
that the case had prejudiced the Congressmen against
him.
DISCUSSION ON THE NEW CHARTER.
Attorney George D. Squires Answers Attorney Henry M. Clement on the
Construction of the Article on Civil Service.
( The Call does vot hold itself responsible
for ths opinions pub nhed m this colnmn, but
presents them for whatever vjlu* they miy
have as communications of general interest.)
To the Editor of The Call: If you wffl
permit me once more to trespass upon
y.ur Space, I would like to say that the
"answer" of Mr. Henry M. Clement, pub
lished In your issue of Sunday, to my
"answer," published in your Issue of the
linn Sunday, proves merely that the
author is an expert w^ai dodger, and that
ll all. Mr. Clement says that "one of the
fundamental rules .if construction is that
if there arises a doubt as to the meaning
of a law it must be read and construed
AS A WHOLE, so as to accomplish. If
; We, the. legislative purpose and In
tent in its adoption." Hut this Is exactly
what h>- declines to do. In fact, he not
only does not read article XIII as a
Whole, but he oven refuses to read sec
tion 10 in that way.
1 am satisfied that if Mr. Clement could
be induced to read article XIII "as a
whole." or even sections 10 and 11, he
would at once perceive that the clauses
which he wrenches out of those sections
and sets up as arbitrary enactments beat
no such construction as he places upon
them. If he declines to do this, bow
erer, but insists upon violating his own
â¢juoted rule of construction, what is to
be done with him? It is manifestly use
less to argue with one who co deliberately
deceives himself.
I claim that article XIII sets up a civil
service system, the basis ol which is
CLASSIFICATION. Until the offloes and
plat < s or employment under the new
charier are "classified" the comm
appointed by the Mayor will have 1
thority over them. What would li

There Is. however, another omission in
article XIII which It Is not so easy to
get over. Section 12, already referred to,
says: , ..
"No deputy, clerk or employe in the
classified civil service of the city and
county who shall have been appointed
under said rules shall be removed or dis
charged except for cause, upon written
charges and after an opportunity^ to De i

This establishes permanent tenureâ tne
life and soul of civil service reform, wltn- ;
out which. Indeed, merit and fitness ex
aminations are unnecessary and a us**"*"
expense. But when Mr. Clement took
this section from the New Tort law and
pasted it up he evidently overlooked sec- i
tion 16 of article XX of the State â¢â¢"Â»Â«- j
"When the term of any officer or com
missioner Is not provided for in this con

Are persons examined or appoint* d un
der civil service rules In raunllMlle
"officers" within the meaning of thl sec
tion? If so. section 12 of article XIII of
the new charter is unconstitutional
If Mr. Clement will consult the case of
People vs. Perry. (79 Cal. 1OÂ») he will Â»nd
the following remark appended to a bu
preme Court decision: ''The n..-mi of
the Beard of Health of the city and
county of San Francisco are officers
within the meaning of article XX, â fftlon
lt>. of the constitution; and a statute fix
ing their term of office at live years Is un
constitutional, and leaves the duration
of the term unfixed and subject to the
pleasure of the Governor, who may ap
point an Incumbent at any time. '
The constitution of i*>i'' (section â¢. arti
cle XI) provided that "when the duration
of any office Is not provided for by this
constitution it may be declared by law.
and if not so declared It shall he held dur
ing the pleasure of the authority making
the appointment; nor shall the duration
of any office not fixed by this constitution
ever exceed four years.' ,Â¥lll, Â¥lll
Chief Justice Murray. In People vs. Hill
(7 Cal. 97) construed this section (which,
as we have seen, is substantially repro
duced In the present constitution) as fol
lows: "By reference to lexicographers It
Will be found that the word 'duration' sig
nifies extent, limit or time. When, there
fore, the time of holding is not fixed thÂ»
tenure of the office Is at the pleasure of
the appointing power. The power of re
moval cannot be divested or taken away
except by limiting the term."
The word "term" is used in the prexent
constitution instead of the word "dura
tion." Webster's Dictionary defines
"term" as follows: "In law, a limit; the
whole time or duration of an estate."
In the case of Vaugn vs. English (8 Cal.
40). Justice Terry thus defined an officer:
"The term officer, in Its common accepta- i
tion, is sufficiently comprehensive to in
clude all persons In any public station
or employment conferred by govern
ment."
It thus appearing that section 15 of ar
ticle XX of the constitution applies to
all "officers" of the city and county of j
San Francisco to be appointed under the I
civil service rules, and that, therefore, !
none of them can bold for a longer term
than four years, it may be ask' d how
Mr. 'Clement proposes to enforce civil ser- .
vice reform at the City HalL If the
practical politicians are to be allowed to
scramble for the offices once In four years
Instead of once In two, as at present. In
what respect are their morals to be im
proved and the Government benefited?
Will Mr. Clement please Inform the
large number of civil service reformers
In this city who are not looking for of
fice why he did not neutralize this con
stitutional limitation on terms of public
employment by providing for the reap- j
pointment every four yean of those who ,
passed the examinations? This could
have been done. Why .is it not done?
As article XIII stands. It Is manifestly <
a farce. It lets the "push" in on Janu- I
ary 8 in a body and retains them Indefi
nitely, or at least until the officials who
appoint them retire from office. The con
stitution limits the terms of all appointees
under- civil service rules to four years,
thus taking the very pith out of the whole
merit system.
The article, however, will serve one very
useful and beneficlent' purpose. it win
provide three Civil Service Commissioners
with comfortable places at $100 a month
each, and give a chief examiner, a clerk j
and a bailiff a chance to earn a good
living at doing nothing. If it is godlike |
to care for the needy, the civil service I
reformers who have placed their faith
in Mr. Clement's work ought to be happy
in the thought that they have at least ;
thrown the mantle of charity over a few
more tax caters. Very respectfully.

BOND SUIT WON
BY SANTA CRUZ
ON THE APPEAL
Decision Agreed in by
Ross and Hawley.
Circuit Judges Gilbert and Ross and
Ulstrict Judge HÂ»wley. sitting as the
linked States Circuit Court of Appeals,
Landed down two opinions yesterday In
the case of Albert H. Waite vs. The City
of Fanta Cruz. The majority opinion by
Judges Ross and Hawley reversed the
Judgment of the United States Circuit
Court and remanded the case, with direc
tions to enter Judgment for the defendant.
The minority opinion by Judge Gilbert
FUFtalns the action of the lower court and
gives precedents and reasons therefor.
The majority opinion goes on to Ray
that the action was brought to recover the
amount alleged to be due on nine refund-
Ing bonds and 2Â« interest coupons at
tached to the one and to other refund-
Ing bonds Issued by thÂ« city of Santa
<ruz. That city had an outstanding
bonded Indebtedness of JZ7l.O<Â£>. and was
also the owner of certain water works
purchased by it from the City Water
Company of Santa Cruz. The water
works were subject to a mortgage to se
cure the outstanding bonded Indebtedness
of that corporation la the sum of SW.uOO
and interest.
A f pÂ«daS election was held for the pur
pose of refunding the outstanding bonded
indebtedness of the city, amounting to
liTl.ooi and c-lphty-nlne first mortgage
t.ond* of the City Water Company ot the
denomination of $1000 each, bearing inter
est at 6 pjer cent ih.t annum. The bond
proposition was carried and an ordinance
was adopted in accordance therewith.
No bids having been made for the bonds.
William T. Jeter. Mayor, and J. Howard
IJaliey.-F. J. Hoffman. E. G. Green and
F. W. Lucas, the Common Council of the
city of Santa Cruz, accepted a proposition
made by the firm of Coffin & Stanton to
tnke all the bonds at par value, less 3 per
cent, without othÂ«T consideration than
their promise to take up the outstanding
bonds, which were to be refunded, and
forward the same "from time to time to
the city for cancellation." After the de
livery of the bonds to Walter Btanton of
the firm on April 24. 1834, the firm sold the
bonds to other parties. Coffin & Stanton
Mr. Gould believes that the issuance of
bond* tor school buildings, sewers, hos
pitals will enhance local values. He says
that our school buildings would shame
Fresno, and would be used. If they were \
good enough, by Stockton for stables. It
will be by its schools that San Francisco
â ball be Judged.
The speaker spoke at length In earnest
support of a policy which will beautify
the city, equip It with splendid parks,
substantial public buildings and progres
sive citizen*. When he had finished M.
Cooney read a report of the committee
on literature. While the report was be
ing read Mayor l'helan entered the hall
and was received with a storm of ap
plause. The literature report was a well
written document pleading for public 1
support for the proposed bond Issues. It
enters minutely into a discussion of the '
many reasons advanced for the proposed ,
extension of th<- park panhandle.
P. H. McCarthy, president of the Build
ing Trades Council, followed In' a. brief
aoÂ«lress. in which ho declared that the |
extension of the nark panhandle Is beyond |
question one of the most vitally Important
measures proposed by the people of the
.-;;>â¢ and should be heartily indorsed by
all public-spirited citizens. If we are to
have a park, he said, we ought to have a
good one, and to have a good one we
must begin the extension. We must be
gin now when property Is as cheap as it
ever will be. And labor will be with the
movement, as it has been with the char
ter and everything else that means prog
ress and prosperity to the city.
Mayor Pnelan was next called upon, and '
received his customary welcome. He was ]
cheered time and again before he had an
opportunity to commence. He gave what
was unquestionably the best exposition
of the proposed bond Issues. He urged
that the city be Improved and benefited
by the expenditure of public money for |
the public good. He said he knows that
the people of the city have awakened to
their possibilities. The charter Is but
a vehicle by which the city may do good
for -if. The questions be fore the people j
are pimple. One is to decide If the pro- ,
posed improvements are desirable and the
other is to determine if the present is the
proper time.
Realizing that there Is a practical unan
imity of opinion in regard to the issuance
of bonds for schools. sewers and hospitals,
the Mayor confined himself to a discus
sion of the panhandle and its extension,
including the Mission park and the boule
vards from the Mission and from the
Presidio and around the water front. The
problem Is simply to complete our old
irk, not to find a new one for the city.
It will bring the park to us when we can
not go where It is now. We speak of
needing hospitals. It Is not hospitals we
want, but health. It Is said that this is
an Improvement for the rich. The rich,
you know, spend their summers and much
of their winters out of town. They say
there is a Chinatown In San Francisco
and a California colony in New York. We
want a place for free recreation and
pleasure for the poor, for those that labor,
for â¢lose that have no vocation.
Having demonstrated what he believes
to be the clear duty of voters in the mat
ter the Mayor then discussed the need
and Ivantam of the city owning what
are Indubitably public utilities. This phase
of the subject, however was not dwelt
upon, as ft Is present subsidiary to the
main Issue. In conclusion the Mayor
begged tho people of the city to be wor
thy of their destiny, to rise to their duty
to make the city one of beauty.
Irving M. Scott was the next speaker.
He declared that ho Is emphatically In fa
vor of all of the proposed public
Improvements, particularly the proposed
extension of the park panhandle. Ho de
clared that while the Improvement will
not be exclusively for the rich. it will be
the rich who will pay for it. Anything.
the speaker urged, that will lÂ»eautlfy the
city, keen its people employed Improve
thÂ«m ana give them pleasure should re
colve every encouragement. The park to
day 1p the wonder and admiration of
every tourist. Let It be finished, made
more beautiful and more useful. Let us
make the city more attractive, tha; wo
may find row citizens, and give to thÂ» city
tho position It was destined for by r.n
ture. It Is the firm belief of Mr. Scott
that every Improvement demanded will
he granted If the extension of the park
panhandle be authorized first.
Colonel Hecht followed In an enthusias
tic advocacy of everything proposed. Un
bays that the first chapter in the obituary
of sllurlanism Is written and an era of
Improvement has begun. President Ber
perot of the Board of Education added his
:r.ite to the discussion, particularly In fa
vor of wwen and schools. The meeting
then adjourned. It is the earnest wish of
the officers that the secretary of each 1.-n-
Erovement club â end to room 76, Flood
building, (he date of each meeting night.
Â»>*caniÂ«Â» Insolvent and never paid the city
v <I"i;ar.
The majority opinion ffoes on to say:
Conredlni: that under the constitution and
laws of California the bond* and coupon* sued
on could only be paid "'it of the special fund
provided for by the act under which they were
issued. If the act and bond* be valid (question*
raised and contested In the milt), no presump
i tion can be Indulged that there are. no money*
In the fund provided for. On the contrary. If
the act be valid, the presumption Is the other
"â¢ay that the taxes provided for were levied by
the officers charged with the duty of levying
them, and that the moneys so raised were In
the fund. It wan not necessary that the com
plainant Â«hnuM show the levy of euch taxes
and the existence of moneys in the special fund.
In such cases, where the plaintiff recovers, and
there ..re no moneys In the fund out of which
: an execution Issued upon the Judgment can be.
rxtisfl'-d. end this because of the refusal of the
proper cfHcers to levy the taxes, the Federal
courts will lMue a writ of mandamus In aid of
It* already acquired Jurisdiction. This Is quite
distinct from an original proceeding for the Is
suance of a writ of mandamus, which. It Is
well settled, cannot be maintained In the Fed
1 eral court*.
Judge Gilbert's dissenting opinion lays
down the proposition that the power to
refund the city's own Indebtedness was
clearly within the letter and spirit of
i the act. The .<Â«,.. of the first mortgage
I bonds of the water company, while It
represented the outstanding indebtedness
Of the city, for which the city was lia
11. and for the payment of which It
might have borrowed money under pro
ceedings therefor. and the refunding of
which was within the spirit of the pro
visions of the act. was nevertheless not
evidenced by the city's bonds and war
rant*, and was therefore not within the
letter of thÂ« law. To that extent the pro
posed application of funds which was to
be realized by the sale of the refunding
bonds was Illegal.
Judge Gilbert quoted several authorities
, on this point and went on to say:
"In the case of Santa Cruz City, from
.ill the transactions culminating In the
delivery of the bonds, It Is clear that the
oincern of the" city acted in the utmost
good faith. There was no fraud, misrep
i resentation or concealment. I submit
1 that tho city Is estopped to deny Its lia
bility, and that the Judgment of the Cir
cuit Court should be affirmed."
Judge James G. Maguire. one of the at
torneys for the city of Santa Cruz, gave
the following general review of the case
"The suit entitled City of Santa Cruz vs
A. 11. wait* was a proceeding by writ of
error in the United States Circuit Court
of Appeals to review and reverse a Judg
ment rendered by the United States Cir
cuit Court on September 29. IS9S. against
the city of Santa Cruz upon certain mu
nicipal bonds and Involving the validity
of what is known as the refunding bond
Issue of April 16, 1594, amounting to 5300.
000.
"The decision rendered to-day holds
that he entire bond Issue In question was
void upon the ground that a considerable
portion of the Indebtedness sought to be
refunded was the indebtedness of the
city Water company of Santa Cruz, a
private corporation, and that the refund
ing act of March 1. MS3. under which the
bonds were Issued, provided only for re
funding municipal Indebtedness evidenced
by the bonds or warrants of the city; that
THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL. TUESDAY. DECEMBER 5. 1899.
ail purchasers of the refunding bonds
were therefore bound to take notice of
the limitations Imposed by the act and
were bound at their peril to examine the
ordinance and notice of election on the
question of refunding by which alone the
Mayor and Common Council obtained Jur
isdiction to issue the bonds.
"That ordinance and notice of election
contained statements and recitals showing
that the bonds were issued in part for an
Illegal purpos-e, and as It appeared from
the findings of the Circuit Court that the
bond issue lor the purposes provided for
by law couia not be segregated from the
bonds issued for the illegal purpose, the
Court of Aj. peals held the entire bond is
sue to be affected by that illegality and
therefore void.
"ThÂ»- city of Santa Cruz never received
any consideration whatever for the re
funding bonus: they were delivered to the
firm of Coffin & Stanton upon a nominal
sale, but really to be sold by that linn
for the city of Santa Cruz.
"Coffin <ft Stanton, being at the time In
falling circumstances, proceeded at or.cc
to sell and hypothecate the bonds for ac
count of thÂ»Â» firm and as collateral se
curity for the firm's debts, appropriating
the proceeds and making no return to tne
city of Santa Cruz.
"At this Juncture the firm of Coffin &
Stanton failed, leaving debts amounting
to about 52.000.000 and assets worth about
one tenth of that amount. The city of
Santa Cms Immediately repudiated the
bond issue on several grounds, including
the ground on which the Circuit Court of
Appeals has adjudged the bonds Invalid.
Most of the bondholders then formed a
pool and assigned their bonds to Albert
H. Waite. who commenced a suit, in
which the decision has Just been rendered.
This decision Is final unless the bondhold
ers shall secure a reversal by the United
States Supreme Court."
REJOICING AT SANTA CRTJZ.
BANTA CRUZ. Dec. *.â Santa Cruz peo

PRESIDENT WHEELEtt AT THE
CHANNING AUXILIARY.
â¦
While ipeaking on the contrast between
the religion of the Greeks and the relig
ion of Americans before the Charming
Auxiliary yesterday, President Wheeler
of the University of California Interjected
many clever sayings that brought forth
frequent applause from the large audience
of ladle?. The speaker said at the begin
ning that it would be almost Impossible
to convey an idea of the beauties or In
terest of the old Greek religion, except
by contrast, and without once bordering
on controversy, he drew very clear pic
tures of the Athenian religion, which he
spoke of as fitting the Individual "like a
kid glove," and the modern religion,
which he said is a department of mod
ern life rather than something which is
born with the individual and is a part
of it.
"The Greek did not give one day In
seven to his religion," said President
Wheeler, "and begrudge an extra even
ing during the week. He was with it all
the time. He had no creed, no tolerance
and no morals, because all were so com
pletely a part of the religion that he in
herited that he had no ne*d of special
codes or creeds. Modern religion par
tajces of so many elements that the dis
penser of it reminds me of a man dis
tributing mail In a postofflceâ he puts a
missive in the moral box. the religious
box. the tolerant box or in any other box
which his fancy may dictate. Not so
with the Greek. There was no such thing
as religion belonging to the individual;
it was a feature of the body politic."
Without committing himself to any Im
plied indorsement of a religion and state
union. President Wheeler painted a glow
ing picture of the smoothness with which
the liaison worked in ancient Greece,
when ethics were oheyed by all and when
an Irreligious man was considered a
traitor.
"It has been said that there is a simi
larity." Bald the speaker, "between the
trials of Socrates and Dr. Briggs, because
they were brth charged with heterodoxy.
This is absurd. Socrates was charged
with advocating religious doctrine that
had a tendency to undermine the state,
and was executed for high treason, which
was a very different condition from that
surrounding Dr. Briggs."
Referring to the division of the month
Into four ports and laying off every sev
enth day for Sunday. President Wheoler
exploded the old meteorological fallacy of
the changes of the moon being responsible
for the weather. "The Greeks divided the
month Into ten parts." he said, "and paid
no attention to dividing time ..f the moon.
You can quarter the moon If you likÂ«, Lut
the moon does not grow by quarters, but
steadily f rom new to full, ani knowj no
changes, so called."
Prior to the address of President
Wheeler the auxiliary held its regular
meeting. The nominating committee re
ported the following nominations for offi
cers for ihe ensuing year:
President. Mrs. P. B. Cornwall: first
vice president. Mrs. Frank W. Sumner;
second vice president, Mrs. Wendell Eas
ton; recording secretary. Mrs. Robert Col
lier; corresponding secretary. Miss Kate
Atkinson: treasurer. Miss Kate Beaver;
busines secretary. Mrs. Ellsha Ransome.
Rev. Horatio Stebbins. D.D.. was re
quested to sneak by the chairman, Mrs.
Lloyd Baldwin, but he simply proposed a
vote of thanks to President Wheeler.

afternoon at Trinity Church. An Inter
esting feature of the session was a report
by Bishop Nichols on the meeting of the
Missionary Council and the House of
Bishops, which took place last October in
St. Louis. The Bishop was a member of
the first meeting, which was held at St.
James Church, Philadelphia, at the time
Bishop Nichols was rector of the church.
The report was one of encouragement
to the workers in the missionary field.
The Bishop said that he went to the con
vention with the idea that more attention
would be given to the missionary work
abroad than at home, and was agreeably
surprised to llnd the home work take the
first place.
One of the important matters discussed
at the meeting was the missionary work
In the Orient, and in this regard the Phil
ippine Islands came In for their share of
attention. Referring to them, the Bishop
said that it was still an open question
as to whether or not they belonged to the
United States.
"The President has not learned his
geography lessonsâ nor any one else, for
That matterâ sufficiently to know yet
whether the Philippines are a part of this
country or not," said Htshop Nichols.
During another part of his report the
reverend gentleman said that the alert
ness of the church prompted it to follow
tho nation wherever it planted the. flag,
but that it would move with extreme cau
tion.
The convention will meet in San Fran
cisco in 1901. and Bishop Nichols believes
that the effect of the whole power of the
church on the community will be to give
tho city a breath of a new religious at
mosphere.

NEWS OF THE BIGGEST SPORTING EVENTS OF THE DAY
ONE SHAKY
START DID
THE DAMAGE
Put lie Lost Confidence When
A;amada Was Left at Tan
ioran Park.
Soni" people think the) recall flag on a
rare track is a (food thing, and others
that it Isn't. It all depends on how one
)a* his money bÂ»t. On Saturday last at
Oakland Jim Ferguson developed the fact
that the flag can bo abiistd, and >Â«â¢
terday, the opening day at Tanforan
I -ark. Jim Caldwell showed plainly
tnough how the public's money can be
â¢ a:.r. .u-tM by not using the bunting to
bring the horses bock. This Is how the
mistake occurred. Afamada ruled an
oddjÂ»-on favorite for thÂ» six furlong
sprint, third on thÂ« card, and It did look
a -down." ThÂ» mare was plunged on
at short odds. In a false breakaway half
of the horse** Including the favorite,
on which VlttMoe had the mount, started
to pull up. Just then dwell released
the barrier. Loving Cup, aloto 1 shot,
looked a winner to within a few yards
of the wire, where Jack Martin, on Mo
corlto. the second chotoe, got up In time
iâ > win by less than a length. The favor
i:e never had a chance.
A* ton of the six choices were barreled,
the books reaped a harvest. The tnrck
*as East, and the weather perfect for
racing purposes.
Dlomed was best of th.c Et&rters In thÂ«
opening run for two-year-olds at seven
furlongs, but Martin, on Advance Guard,
<nutro<le nson. astride the brother to
r-lggs. getting the deÂ«clKlon by over two
lengths. My Gypwy. the favorite, looked
her old time speed.
Lothian, with Henry In the saddle, wot.
the mile and a sixteenth run. Silver
Tone had the call, but after leading for
iK*vrly a mile began to cult and was
beaten two lengths. Castake, a 20 to 1
chot. was third.
Eight lined up In* the mile and a fur
long handicap. Through clever riding
Dcvln, on Opponent, landed â¢':â .Â« 7 to 1
chance winner over Dr. Nembula by a
length. Morlncl ran third.
I >uke of York won the hurdle handicap.
The Jumper ruled a 5 to l shot, and in a '
drive lea Granp^r. the favorite, out a
reck. Major B ran third.
Oorritrnn's horse G. B. Morris made a
gallop of the final mile and a sixteenth
celling run. The -ay home was Installed
favorit*. and he had only to romp to
boat Tempo eight lengths. Fleming, a
Â« to 1 chance, ran third.

AMATEURS WILL BATTLE
FOR FISTIC SUPREMACY

If the contests are carried out with as much neatness and dispatch is the
Initial programme there Is every possibility that the Columbia! will meet with
the approval ct the sporting public.
Matchmaker Murphy of the club has arranged a splendid card for Thursday
right. James Ryan, a lightweight, who comes from Montana with a record f>r
grit and victories won. Is matched to fight Charles Vleksrs, a local amateur w w .o
is rapidly rising to the top of the h<\np by reason of his cleverness and hit

of the contestants. Ryan is strong and willing, and the snim- can be said of
Vicker?. Rynn has been trl^d out slid found to he a worthy aatagomsi f.Â»r Vlck

PUTS BURNS
TO SLEEP
Californian Knocks Out the
Cincinnati Lad in the
Eighth Round.
Special Mspatcb to Th* CML
BT. LOUIS, Dec. Frank McConnell
of San Francisco knocked out Charley
Burns of Cincinnati in the eighth round
of what was to have been a twenty-round
bout, in ihe arena of the St. Louis Ath
letic Club at the Fourteenth-street Tliea
ter to-night. The men fought at catch
weights.
Much had Wen written regarding Me-
Connell's wonderful ability as a rini? lac
tician, and a good-sized crowd turned out
to witness the contest. The Oalifornian
had no difficulty in taking Burns' meas
ure, and his work fully justified all that
had been said of him. ICeC tnnell was
trained to the hour, but Burns did not
seem to be up to a bruising mill. Mc-
Connell was very cool and calculating Â«ml
his side-stepping and ducking weru su
perb.
The men t!ld not begin fighting ham un
til well into the fifth round, when Mi-Con
nell drove right and left to the head, forc
ing Burns to the ropes. Just before the
bell tapped McConnell sent a left to
Bump' head, sending him to his corner
decidedly oggy.
Burns recuperated quickly and put up a
good article of llKht in the seventh, put
tine his right hard to the jaw at the
belt.
In the elgl-th McConnell put 3urns
down with a hard right to the jaw, but
he wan up quickly and retaliated by driv
ing .i stiff right to IfcConnell'i stomach.
He followed this blow by a rlght-turnd
swing to Mac's head, which Jarred him
badly. McConnell cut lons*-, and after a
series of nifT exchanges, In which to
had much the better of It. crossed Hums
with a left to the Jaw. Hums was duzod
by the .blow and the Callfornian, seeing
his* advantage, crossed his right like a
flash to the point of the Jaw. bringing
Burns to the floor flat on his tack, where
he lay mot'.onleÃs after he was couuid4
out.
I fennel] helped carry his beaten ad
versary to his corner. It was some time
before the Cinclnnatlp.n recovered pos
session of l.is faculties.
Tim Hurst ref freed the contest.
MARIN GAME LAWS
CAUSE MUCH STRIFE
i
Sportsmen and Lawyers Object to Su
pervisors Discriminating Against
Repeating Shotguns.
SAN RAFAEL, Dec. 4.â The wrangle
over the Marln County game laws on ac
count of their Intrinsic absurdities and
the antipathy Ronerally felt toward thÂ«
Board of Supervisors, has reached a
point where the County Fathers realize
that some derisive move must be made.
It Is confidently expected that the session
of the Supervisors to-morrow will be In
teresting in consequence, but If the board
follows out the Intention stated by Indi
vidual members the controversy will be
come more heated than ever. It Is now
commonly admitted that the board made
a mistake in rejecting the proposed game
laws submitted for Its consideration by
City Attorney Boyd, which contained
none of the objectionable provisions lead-
Ing to co much strife.
The clause resulting in the most trou
ble has been thÂ«. provision excluding the
use of "pump" guns, a well-known make
of repeating shotguns, on the ground of
claas legislation. Capitalist Marshall
fought this clause and apparently proved
it to be unconstitutional on the day when
Attorney (_narle:> S. Wheeler accused Jus
tice George Redden of being a "weakling"
and asked for a certified copy of the dis
missal of the case. This clause. Is re
garded as an absurdity, because another
provision of the ordinance makes It un
lawful to kill more than twenty-five
quail In one day.
Instead of seeing it In that light, how
ever, the bonrd intends to Interdict the
use of all repeating shotguns. Several
wealthy sportsmen, among Hiem Mar
shall, affirm their determination to fight
such a law to a finish, and a delegation of
sportsmen and attorneys will be present
to-morrow to protest against such action
being taken by the Supervisors. " ":â¢.-.

ONG YONG THREATENED.
Overall Manufacturer Complains to
Police of a Price on His Head.
Onjr Yong. a manufacturer of overalls at
618 Merchant street, complains to the po
lice that he is afraid of his life, and asks
protection. According to his story he has
refused to employ men at the dictation of
the Chinese Tailors' Union, and that body
is out for his scalp. About one week ago
a price of $600 was placed on his head, and
Saturday night It was raised to $800. The
trouble all arises out of a difficulty which
has been Roing on among the Chinese

JOE KENNEDY MAY BE
MATCHED WITH RUSSELL
Manager Charley Long of the Western
Athletic Club is making an effort to bring
Joe Kennedy and "Big" Russell together
in the ring !n the latter part of this
month. Russell has shown a willingness
to make the match, but owing to t)
senoc of Kennedy, who is In Sacramento,
his wishes cannot be learned. Long has
proved himself an astute manager, and
he is confident that the two heavy
weights would draw well. He calls at
tention to the vast improvement shown
by Russell since his memorable bout with
Van JJuskirk, whin the latter partook of
the big Fellow's ear. and also to t h<- ile
stre on the part of local fistic followers to
see Joe Kennedy perform stoot hi.
ii t th<- Lands of Peter Maher.
It would not take fit her man long to
get Into condition. Russell baa im;
himself greatly t>> boxing with Aâ  i
(ircKgalns and some clever amateurs who
have been in training at the San Fran-
Slsco Atht-ltlc Club. As Is already known.
Kennedy has just defeated 'Soldier"
Walker at the capital and is in rood
fettle.
Manager Long haÂ« practically matched
Jimmy Lawler to tight jimmy Maxwell
as a preliminary to the foregoing bout.
It is Bald Lawler Is stronger to-day thai
ever before In hit ring career lie was
anxious to go on again with Rufe Turner,
with whom he fi. tight twenty stiff roundi
at Btoekton. a- the latter Is match, l
to tight "Kill" Parker l-.-fore the Na
tional Club he expressed a willingness to
go on with Maxwell. The latter is
anxious tn again light the colored man,
and he has hopes of petting a second
meeting by defeating I.awler. Both lads
are willing and aggressive rlngsters. and
such a preliminary wmild prove a drawlnir
card.
On the evening of December 12 thÂ«Â» San

"I hope you will say for me to the foot

they made a gallant tight, and tha,t it
was especially gratifying to the depart
ment that, certainly so far .1- my ob
servation went and bo far as I have heard
from others, nothing could have been
manlier or handsomer or In better spirit
than the way In which the two team*
made their fight, and that thÂ« absence of
any brutal, unbecoming or ungentlemanly
conduct was especially noteworthy.
"Tell them that the department docs
not forget that they are Just as brave.
Just an manly, just as faithful to their
duty, and have given Just the same as

O'BRIEN AND
ERNE FIGHT
TO A DRAW
Both Men Covered Wi'h
Blood at the Close of
Their Combat.
Special Dispatch to Th.
NEW YORK, Dec. 4.â Frank Erne of
Buffalo and Jack O'Brien of N'.-w fork
fought twenty-five rounds at 133 pound*
at the Coney Island Snorting Club ti>
night, and at the end the referÂ»-Â«e. tkorgu
Slier of Chicago, declared the bout a
draw. This decision was fair and Just,
but It did not satisfy a number of persons
who had picked a favorite.
O Brlen forced the fighting, but Erne's
work was of a cleaner and mort Bclentltlc
character. O'Brien's blows ft-II with a
force that was not behind Erne's. It was
the old en!" 1 of a clean boxer against a
hurricane tighter. Of the two O' Brim's
face bore the worse mark*. Both his eyes
were bndly damaged, und his muuth and
nose were puffed up. Erne's left eye wm
Â»ma.Â«hrd. but this will not hurt htm half
as much as the punishment he received on
the body during the mill. O'Brien Invari
ably got In piledrivlng blows on tho stom
ach, ribs and kidneys, and the frequent
visitations of his fists left red wvlu on
the Buffalo man's body.
O'Brltn was an even-money favorite
about the fifteenth round, while beforo
the tight began I'M to 7u was laid against
him. During the fight O'Brien scored
three knockdowns, while none was record
ed against him.
Both ni- were In fine condition, but it
is Just possible that Erne was drawn a
bit line to get down to the limit. A* tha
mill drew to a close so eager was each of
the contestants for a /avorable decision
that they fought like furies. Erne 1.a. . .
the call on points, possibly, and O'Brtr.i
Inflicting the worst punishment. The f.nal
round whs furious, blows coming thick
and fast. They hugged each other and
punched in the clinches. They wrestled
and pulled and dragged each other la
their efforts for supremacy, and a de
scription of the blows would be Impossible.
Both were covered, with blood, but
O'Brien's face was the worst- looklrm,
both eyes being bunged up and his moutti
badly puffed.
When the gong finished the bout neither
man heard it. and the house was In an
uproar. There were cries of "Erne!
Erne!" and "O'Brien wins!" from th
partisans, of the men, while the moro
level-headed said a draw would be a Just
decision. As soon as the noise had abated
somewhat the master of ceremonies an
nounced that the referee had declared tha
bout a draw. â¢
DIED IN A STREETCAB.
Sudden Demise of Edward J. Haas
While on His Way to His
Home Last Night.
Edward J. Haas, who had been connect
ed with the Capitol Flour Mill* for tho
past sixteen years, died In one of the Cas
tro-street enrs last night at 6:30 o'clock
while on his way to his home at B Eu
reka street.
The deceased had boarded the car on
Market street after quitting his days
work, and rode to Twentieth street, his
accustomed place for getting oft. Having
been a regular passenger on the Castro
street line, he was well known to all th*
conductors of that line, and when the car
approached hlÂ» destination the conductor
noticed that he had not moved from hla
seat. He was approached by this official,
who had thought that Haas had fallen
asleep. On attempting to uwake him It
was found that he was dead. The car ran
on to the .-nd of the line at Twenty-fifth
street, where the deceased was removed
to the carhouse. and ht.< widow was at
once notified. She hastened to the place
and was given hi- effects. In the mean
time Police Officer George Farrell camÂ»
upon the scene and remained with tho
body, and at the same time notified tho
Coroner's office. Deputies IÂ«acombe ami
Smith went after the remains with the
Morgue wagon. On their arrival a further
search of the dead man's clothing was
had. when It was found that his watch
was ml.'sing. The watchchnln which wm
supposed to be attached to the watch van
In place on the vest, but there was no
watch to bo found. As, according to th-Â»
statement of Mrs. Haas, her husband had
carried a watch, what became of th*>
timepiece remains a mystery. The body
whs removed to the Morgue pending nn
Inquest. Heart disease Is supposed to da
the cause of death, as the deceased ha<l
b**Â»n suffering with neuralgia for somo
time past.

SOME ATTRACTIONS AT THt FRENNA MURDER TRIAL.
WILLIE WALSH
ACCUSES FRENNA
IN OPEN COURT
Declares He Saw Him
Draw a Pistol.
HEARD A THREAT TO KILL
SENSATIONAL TESTIMONY IN
THE MURDER TRIAL.
The specter of a pibbet haunted the
shadows of Judge Carroll Cook's court-
room yesterday during the trial of Joseph
P. Frenna for the murder of James F.
Turner. It was a trying day for the val
iant barber who is endeavoring to convince
a Jury of intelligent men that although
he was insane at the time he got behind
Turner and filled him full of lead he
was acting in self-defense. Frenna's at
torneys have already indulged in soir.e
extraordinary gymnastics in their efforts
to save their client's neck by setting up
this Joint plea of temporary Insanity and
self-defense, so that nothing they may
advance in the future should occasion
great surprise.
Willie Walsh, the much-sought messen-
tighten UM t Tur
ner's tÂ»]a\..r, was thÂ« lirst wiiv
the stand :n the morning, and hli
nKiiy on dlr. â â â¢
: . but ha: than
the facts brought out (j.i cross-examina
tion, when the efforts of the attorneys for
the accused In attempting to show that
{hÂ« had made conflicting statements re
garding what he saw and heard on the
fateful morning of the 29th of August
on the third floor of the Crocker building
' only resulted in creating a suspicion of a
job to coerce a \.ltnes3.
The young vagrant from San Bernar
dino looks not unlike hundreds of other
boya of the same age. who are neither
specially good nor particularly bad. HÂ«
gave his age as 17. and his manner while
on the stand created rather a favorable
â¢I Impression. He told his story clearly and
unhesitatingly, and there whs no trace of
studied preparation. He had heard little
that had â  direct bearing on the tragedy
and had seen but little, but what lit. did
see ai:d hear was very damaging to Fren
na's cause, and was told with a can
dor and positlveneea that were very con
vincing.
The boy's recital, barring one or two
Interruptions by counsel, was listened to
â¢ with breathless interest by every one in
the courtroom. In response to questions
by District Attorney Murphy. Walsh said
that on the day of the shooting he was in
the employ of the Western Union and
American District Telcsraph companies.
About 9 a, m. he was called to the ninth
floor of the Crocker building, and after
completing his business there he started
to walk down the stairs. Just before he
reached the third floor he heard the voices
of men wrangling.
"What else did you hear?" asked Dis
trict Attorney Murphy.
'â¢I heard somebody say. 'You ,
I'll kill you.'
"I was about six. steps from the foot of
the stairs at that time and could not see
the men. When I got to the foot of the
stairs I saw a man with a light overcoat
pull a pi&tol."
â¢ Where was that man standing when
you saw him pull a pistol?"
"He was standing near the corner of the
corridor where you turn to go down onto
the second floor."
"Did you see anybody else?"
"No, sir."
â¢'Well, you saw the man draw the pistol
From what pocket did he draw It?
"I can't exactly nay."
"In what direction did he point it?"
"Toward the north elevator."
"Well, then what did you do?"
1 When he pointed the pistol I turned
and ran upstairs. I don't know exactly
what floor It wan. I was three or four
steps from the fourth floor when I heard
the first shot fired."
" Did you come downstairs again after
the. shots were fired?"
"Yes. sir. I came down in the elevator
There was quite a crowd on the third
i floor when I got there "
"Who is the man with the light over
coat on. whom you saw draw the pistol?"
asked the District Attorney. "Ig he here
In the courtroom?"
"It seems to me that is the man sitting
over there." pointing toward Frenna.
"Kindly ask Mr. Frenna to stand up,"
said the District Attorney, addressing At
torney Barnes. As the barber arose to
his feet, Mr. Murphy continued:
"Is that the man?"
"Yes, sir That's the man."
This concluded the direct examination
of the witness, and he wan turned over
to the tender mercies of Attorney Hos
mer for cross-examination. After a few
preliminary questions, the latter asked:

HIE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBEE 3, 1809.
"Didn't you tell District Attorney Daley
of San Bernardino that what you heard
that morning on the third floor of the
Crocker building was:
" 'you . Frenna, I'll kill
you' ?"
"I told him the other statement first
and he told me it would be better to put
Frenna's name in." replied the boy
quietly.
This unexpected answer caused a per
ceptible stir In the courtroom and all
eyes were bent to catch what might fol
low. Attorney Homier sought to secure
an admission that Walsh himself had
first made the statement of what he had
heard with Frenna's name Included, but
the boy strenuously denied that he had
done so. The attorney then demand** to
Know if the boy had not visited his oflVÂ»
on September â¢> before he left the city and
left â  note addressed to him reading as
follows:
"All that I seen was half the man tnnt
shot and I heard some loud talking.
That's all."
This was admitted, but it is difficult to
â Â«Â« wherein the admission Is of any ma
terial beneflt to the defense. Walsh was
finally excused and the prosecution an
nounced that the people rested. Hosmer
then consumed an hour In reading nis
opening statement to the Jury. It was a
voluminous document, and In It tne ae
fense claimed that it would prove that
Turner was a very bad man and that he
had not only swindled Frenna but that
he had threatened to kill him. this threat
having been first made as far back a*
IS!>5. Every financial transaction In whlcn
Turner and Frer.na were Jointly involve
was recounted, and the attorney for the
defense contended that Frenna had be
come so wrought up during the pastine
years In trying to secure a settlement
from Turner that his mind was affected.
â¢'Then you set up a defense of insanity,
do you?"' Interrupted Mr. Murphy.
"Well er y-e-s; temporary Insanity and
self-defense." replied Hosmer. hesitn:
inKly. "We will show that on the morn
ing of the killing Frenna was not in his
right mind." continued the attorney more
positively. He then proceeded to detail
what occurred In the Crocker ; bmldln*
immediately preceding the shooting from
the standpoint of the defense.
"When Frenna stepped out of the ele
vator and saw Turner, said Mr. Hos
mer â¢he said to him. 'What have you
done with my land?' Immediately upon
his asking this question Turner, who bad
passed him. started back. and. putting
one hand behind him. said. 'You â - â .
Frenna. I'll "how you. At these
words Frenna. who had secured a permit
to carry a revolver because of Turner s
repeated threats to kill him. drew his
pistol and fired."
F B Daley of San Bernardino, who in
the' capacity of a Deputy Sheriff, brought
Willie Walsh to San Francisco, was then
called and the boy Identified him as the â 
man at whose suggestion he had changed
his statement. inserting Frenna name,
"so it would sound better. Court then
took a recess until 2 o'clock for lunch
Charles Kaston. a butcher or. Polk
street was the first witness to take the
stand for the defense. He was followed
by Richard Wood, a grocery Charles
Snohn. a saloon-keeper, and a. triedman.
a clear dealer. Their testimony all re
fated to having seen Freiins .at about 9
o'clock on the morning of the tragedy,
before he came downtown. They all tes
tified that he appeared to be in good
spirits E*ston was particularly sure on
this Point, as he said Frenna told hi in
that he had received an addition to hie
family and "was feeling good.
The star witness of the afternoon ses
sion was former District Attorney Daley of
Berna-dino. He testified that Walsh had
made a statement in the presence of him- ,
self and Sheriff Rouse in which he had
said that Frenna's name was mentioned
in the threat heard by him just previous
to the shooting in the Crocker building
He said the boy had made the statement
under oath and signed it. but that upon
reconsideration asked that Frenna a name
be stricken out. This statement was after
ward destroyed and another with Fren
ria's name left in was prepared which
Walsh also signed. Daley admitted that
the second statement was made at tho
HUCR'-stlon of the Sheriff and himself, but
he declared positively that they had not
suggested what language the boy should
use They had simply urged him to tell
the' truth. The affidavit was put In evi
dence, no objection being made by the
prosecution. Daley denied on cross-ex
amination that he was in any way In
terested in the case, but he finally and
with evident reluctance, admitted that as
soon as he secured young Walsh's state
ment be had tried to reach both Attorney
Barnes and Attorney Hosmer over the
long-distance telephone. Not being able
to communicate with them at once by tel
ephone he had sent a telegram to H. A.
Keller, a friend' of his residing In Ban

ant's attorneys and inform them that he
had some good evidence In favor of the
defendant.
The only other witness examined was
Bernard Blenenfold, who has an office on
one of the upper floors of the Crocker
building. Mr. Bienenfeld testified that
Frenna was In the elevator that carried

ONE DEAD FRUIT
SCALE ALARMED
THE INSPECTORS
German Officers Were
Very Strict.
CALIFORNIA PEARS REJECTED
QUEER STORY THAT TRAVELED
IN LETTERS.
A queer story has comÂ© to this city
within the past few days in letters from
Germany addressed to exporters of Cali
fornia dried fruits. The essence is that
one little. insignificant San Jose scale,
and that one, sole representative of a do
generate clans .of Insect life, had been
considered with* sufficient seriousness to
bar a largo lot of California dried pears
out of Germany. All the letters i|ni
There was only one scale and that one
was dead. The natural supposition *Â»a3
| na t a dead scale would be harmless.
"No," said the stern and acute German
officials, "it will not do. Where there
is a dead scale there may also be a live
scale. True it Is that we have not dis
covered a live one nor even another dead
one, but one is enough; indeed too
many." Consequently a whole lot of
fruit, after crossing the width of one
continent and one ocean, was ordered out
of the country.
H. Schacht of J. K. Armsby has re
ceived a letter telling the fact. Mr.
Schacht says that he has heard that sev
eral lots of California dried pears have
been held up in Germany during the
present season. He had heard of only
one scale to account for this. That wae a
dead scale. Indeed. Mr. Schacht did not
pee how a live scale could get into Ger
many on a dried pear, in view of the
treatment the ntars received before they
were shipped from California. Instruc
tions were recently sent broadcast
throughout Germany from Berlin, enjoin-
Ing great care in the admission of drie-J
and green fruit alike.
"The German officials," said Mr
Schacht, "do not wish to annoy us un
necessarily, but they wish to get perfect
protection against the scale. We do thÂ»
same thing when we throw overboard
fruit trees from Japan that are infected.
California needs a law that will provide
for an inspection so thorough that no
scale shall get out of the country. Fruit
that Is free should be entitled to have a
certificate to that effect. That, being offi
cial, ought to be accepted as prlma facie
evidence in Germany.
"Eastern men have certificates for their
apples, and those are accepted as proof
that they are all right. We tried to get
an Inspection law and It was passed but
Gage vetoed It. The matter Is serious
to the whole State. Germany promises
to be of as much value to California, un
der proper conditions, as a dried-fruit
purchaser as the whole of the Eastern
market of the United States. Our im
portations of dried fruit to Germany this
year will amount to nearly 2.000.000
pounds. The steadily Increasing popula
tion of European countries provides for
the consumption of all the fruit they can
raise In its green condition. They must
therefore, get their dried fruits .rom
abroad and largely from California "
A. W. Porter of Porter Brothers had
also received a letter about that one dead
scale and the effect that its discovery
had upon California dried fruits then in
Germany. He said that It would be Im
possible to Identify the lot that was con
demned. The goods were exported from
New York to Germany and to other Eu
ropean points in large quantities, es
pecially to Hamburg and Havre. He hud
not heard that any fault had been found
with California prunes. About one-tenth
of all the prunes exported from California
have gone to Germany this season
J. F. Ullrich, who has large dealings
with Germany in the California fruit line
said that he had heard of two lots of
pears that had been rejected. As soon as
an inspector discovered one scale even if
that was a dead one. he would hold up
the entire lot In which the solitary scale
was found. The German inspectors
claimed that if there was one dead scale
there might be one live one. The care
that the German authorities had exerted
during the past season was greater than ;
they ever had displayed before. Mr . Ull
rich had already received two letters
There have been seizures in Berlin and In
Hamburg. None having been made In
Bremen. Inquiries have been sent to that
place on tho suspicion entertained by the
German officials that the inspection had
grown slack at that place. Hereafter ho
Mr. Ullrich said, the California producers
might count upon having a very sharp in
spection at all German points. There had
been very few. rejections of California
dried fruits this year. But the rejection
of a lot for one dead scale was indica
tive. â¢

LOCAL BELLE

ON THE STAGE

Lyceum Company.
SHINES IN A THINKING PART
IS A GRANDDAUGHTER OF A
PHILANTHROPIST.
â¢
Stunning Figure nnd Pretty Face
Capture the Manager, Who Signs
Her Without Investigating
Her Ability.
There has been a-buzzing and a-hum
ming over the teascups in local swell Jew
lsh circles ami all sorts of reasons have
been advanced to account for Miss Ger
trude Lewis' desertion of the ballroom
for the stage.
On Monday evening last the local belle
made her debut with Frohraan's Lyceum
company at Daly's Theater, New York,
playing a small "thinking" part in the
latest English Importation, "The Ma
neuvers of Jane." On the programme Is
the comforting Information that Miss
Lewis Is playing the part of Miss Bow
ater. The newspapers reproduced the
programme In their respective critic's re
view of the play, and that Is all the no
tice that the metropolis has taken of the
local belle.
Friends of Miss Lewis who were fortu
nate enough to witness the opening of the
Lyceum Company say her part is insig
nificant, but that the debutante looked
lovely and that her gowns were stunning.
Miss Lewis Is the daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. William Lewis and granddaughter
of the well known and greatly loved
philanthropist, W. S. Levy, president of
the Associated Charities and of the He
brew Orphan Asylum.
As far as the knowledge of Miss Lewis'
friends go her determination to adopt the
stage was both sudden and unexpected.
No preliminary studies were Indulged In
and none of the usual preparations made.
The gossips have fitted round her debut
a pretty tale 'in which Miss Lewis has
rather more to say than in the play in
which she is assisting. In It a lieutenant
of the United States Volunteers makes a
taking hero. There is a stern papa and
indulgent mamma and the sweet heroine
herself. The strong scene of the touch-
Ing romance In real life is reached wh**n
the heroine says if she cannot wed the
lieutenant she will go on the stage, and
the parents, choosing the lesser evil, out
fit the beautiful, headstrong daughter for
a life behind the footlights.
Miss Lewis' people declare that the only
truth In all the tale is the outfit. The
beautiful girl took with her to New York
the most exquisite gowns the local work
shops could turn out, and. arrayed in all
her splendor and accompanied by her
papa, she called upon the great New York
manager.
Frohman saw the California beauty and
for a moment he was stunned. "I want to
go on the stage," she Bald, and when the
manager got his breath back he grabbed
a contract blank and handed Miss Lewis
a pen. "Sign, " he said; "you're a mem
ber of the Lyceum Company."
Miss Lewis has written to her family in
this city of her easy entree In the dra
matic world and her determination to
win for herself, by hard work, a place
of honor in the life behind the footlights.

Attorney Curtis talking to the witness in
the corridor, and the Judge became angiy
and ordered Captain Blunt to ..ake the
stand. The captain denied that he had
t<>:.l the witness to ke< % p away. He a. id
asked him why he did not report at
reveille and ordered him at once to go
to the Presidio and report at quarter*.
"Did you not know? asked the Jmlce.
"that he was regularly subpenaed to ap
pear here?"
The captain replied that no papers weie
perved on him at the barracks, and the
Ju<lge retorted: "I want you to under
stand that the soldiers at the Presidio are
under the Jurisdiction of the courts, and
if I learn that anybody, officer or private.

Justice I Bhall punish him severely."
Attorney Curtis was also called to the
Btand and Fhlfted the repsonslblllty upon
the captain.
Corporal Morris testified that the de

a shooting scrape the previous night.
Then Policemen Alexander and Stanton
testified as to the shooting, and positively
identified the defendant as the man.
The case was continued till Thursday,
and the Judge Issued a bench wa.-rant
for Daniel Jackson'B arrest, fixing .its
bonds at $1000.
Daniel Jackson was taken Into custody

VII. SIR ANTHONY VAN DYCX.
BY ARTHUR HOEKKK.
The history of art presents no more ro
mantic or attractive figure than that of
Sir Anthony Van Dyck, the (feat Flem
ish painter, who In a life of only foity
two years managed to accomplish the
work of several ordinary careers, and
who, with all the enormous amount of la
bor entailed In his work, yet found time
to enjoy most of this world's pleasures,
to live en prince and to spend money with
as lavish a hand as the greatest noble In
the land, to have the patron:'.?" of roy
alty and of the nobility, and to leave be
hind him at his death a reputation that
has Increased with time, until to-day Mi
name Is a synonym for all that is mag
nificent in the art of portrait painting.

Jng on her favorites nearly all the glfis
she has to offer, and Van Dyrk came 'n
for her special providlr.?. Th
that come to the average patrter wÂ«re
never his. He wax born Â«>f proepi
parents .md was one of twelve children
of a successful merchant In silks ard
woolens in Antwerp. He came Into ".tie
world on March 22, 1" f <9. 1 h*> Â«
burgher, his father, saw very MOB that
he had a remarkable son. am! he took all
possible pains to hayÂ«- him properly edu
cated. His mother, too. was of a m<>*t
artistic temperament and gave str
tentlon 10 the training of the lad 1..-
fortunately. however, she died wh<>a be
was only 8 years of age, and the
his father had charge of him. He km
sent to the studio of a historical painter
at the age of 10, being then an excellent
draughtsman, with some <-xperience m
color, and with this man, llendrik Van
Baler. . he remained for five y.
It is hardly necessary to say that he
surpassed all the other stiidcilts Imme
diately; when he was between 15 and 18
years of ape his work attract***! the aÂ»
tentlon of Ruben*, who was thrn the
great painter of his epoch, as he rerriirr.*
to-day one of th* greatest of all tlmÂ«, and
he entered his studio. Here again he took
first place, and how he progressed the
following anecdote will perhaps show:
Rubens was In the habit each day. after
his morning's work was done, of tnkin<
a long ride In the country, and while he
was away the key to his studio was in
trusted to an old keeper. The StttAsfcta,
desirous of seeing the master's work !n
an Incomplete state that they mU'it
study his methods, occasionally preva.i-d
upon the custodian to let them In during
the absence of Rubens. On one occi
sion several of them were thus surrep
titiously permitted to enter, and amon*
the party was young Van Dyck. Some
skylarking ensued, and by accident one
of the students brushed against a newly
painted canvas on which the colors w~re
still wet. The action completely wlf .i
away the throat and chin of the figure.
Everybody was aghast, for It meant thut
their escapade would be discovered. io
say nothing of the master's anger when
he should acÂ« hie work destroyed. la
despair one of the pupils suggested that
as there were still some hours of dav
llght left they should ende-ivor to repair
damages, and he named Van Dyck as the
one to undertake the Job. By night An
thony had restored the canvas to its
original condition, and so faithfully had
he done his work that when Rubens re
turned he remarked that he had not rv
allzed how well he had painted the throat
and chin. Later, however, he discovered
the cheat, but he was so delighted with
the dexterity of the young man that he
forgave the rest and paid even greater at
tention than ever to his remarkable pu;>!l.
The admission of Van Dyck, before he
was 19. Into the Guild of St. Luke was
unprecedented. He at once branched out
for himself, painting portraits and taking
now and then a religious commission. One
of his pictures about this time Is "Christ
Bearing the Cross," which may be seen In
the Church of the Dominicans at
Antwerp- Again he was called upon
to assist Rubens in some of his
decorations for church work, and
through his master he met the distin
guished patron of the tine arts, an Eng
lishman, the Earl of Arundel. by whom It
Is supposed he was Induced soon to make
a trip to London, although he was urged
by his master to go to Italy for a course
of study of the masters there. The Eng
lish visit was of short duration, and he
soon started for home, after painting pos
sibly a portrait of the King, although this
Is by no means certain. However, he
went away and stopped at the Invitation
of Frederick of Nassau, Prince of Orange,
in Holland. On one occasion at Haarlem
be dropped in to see Franz Hula, announc
ing himself as a wealthy patron of the
arts. As usual, Hals was at the tavern,
but he returned post haste on heating of a
distinguished visitor. Van Dyck repre
sented that he had only two hours to
spare and asked to have his portrait
painted. This was done by the grÂ«*al
Dutchman In his most approved manner
Then Van Dyck proposed that he should
try the work. To this Hals wonderlngly
consented, and was amazed to set thÂ«
stranger handle hlÂ» materials In so m.i -
terly a manner, for the nlleged painter
did the work even more rapidly than had
Hals. 'The man who can do that." said
the Dutchman, "must either be the devil â
or Van Dye It r
The Illness of the artist's father re
called him to Antwerp, when he arrived
In time to receive his blessing and to
promise him to paint a picture for tho
chapel of the Dominican Sisters, who had
attended the elder through his sickness.
In seven years the promise was fulfilled,
resulting In the great "Crucifixion." which
now belong!* to the Academy of Antwerp.
The father dead, the Journey to Italy was
resolved upon, but the painter did not Ret
farther than the little town of Bavcnthem,
near Brussels, where he lingered some
time. Some claim that a romance kept
Van Dyck here and that the woman In thÂ«
case was Anna Van Ophem. who occupied
the curious position at court of mlstres*
of the Infanta Isabella's hounds Van
Dyck was by no means above the dictate*
of love and pave ample evidence of the
frailty of human nature when It came to
a question of the fair sex. It Is said that
he painted the Archduchess' hounds here,
He certainly did a couple of composition:!
for the parish church. Possibly he amuse<l
himself with the above-mentioned fair
lady. It was like him to seek consolation
with beauty and youth.
TheM> two parish church pictures, how
ever, have quite a history. There wer^
several efforts made
to steal them, to
purchase them or to
obtain them at all
hazards. They were
taken by the
French, but return
ed by th" victorious
allies In 1815. and It
Is said that an
American once brib
ed a sane of thle-res
to pot them for him.
but they were nn
rucco a a ful. Van
Dyck finally scot to
Venice, where he
lived the pace and
ran ahort of fun**
very quick! He
was naturally *
spend thrift and
careless about com
missions: what with
dally visits to the
galleries and plung
ing Into social gay
etles he had little
time for original
and re m uneratlvo
work. To his credit,
however. It should
be said that he hnd
studied with great
ser! ouÂ» nc s .â¢â¢ the
works of the mas
ters. The necessity
for ready cash be
coming pressing, ha
betook hlrnseli to
Genoa, where he re
membered that
some years pre
viously his master
Rubens had been
cordially received.
Once there he found
to hi* delight that
his reputation had
preceded him. The
Genoese evidently
appreciated go o v
work, for commissions poured In from thÂ«
lirst and richest people of the city. It was
with difficulty that he found time to ac
commodate all his would-be patrons, and
his work to-day remains the pride of the
galleries In Genoa. Among the more Im
portant things he painted here are the
two famous portraits on horseback of
Antonio Glullo Brignole and Giovanni
Paolo MalM: Hplnola in white armor; Pal
lavldno In his robes of otllce as Embaa
sador at the papal court, and. best of all,
the Marchioness of Durazzo and her two
daughters. Ho also painted a few classi
cal and nacrrd pictures.
From Gtnoa he wÂ«>nt to Rome: this was
In 1623, and he stayed there nearly two
years. For a while he was the guest of
the great historian and diplomatist. Car
i dinal Bentlvogllo, who had once been
papal nuncio at the court of Brussels, ami
who was a great patron of the Dutch ar
tists. Van Dyck painted hi portrait,
which hangs In the Plttl Palace at Flor
ence, and is a masterpiece. Other mem
bers of noble families sat to him, and his
purse was soon full to overflowing. As
ever the man of elegance and fashion.
Van Dyck cut a swath here In a social
I way and attracted much attention, even
, among the reckless Roman society. From
i Italy the painter went In a sailing vessel
to .sjciiy. where again he met with a flat
tering reception and found a number of
sitters among the great people there, but
1 In the midst of his enjoyment of this visit
a plague broke out and Van Dyck went
back to Genoa, and so on to Antwerp,
where he arrived about the end of 1428.
Although he returned laden with hon
ors after a most successful trip, he found
In his absence he had been supplanted by
others. First of all. the fame of Rubens
was so great and so overpowering as to
make that master stand quite alone, the
peer of any of the men In the country;
and among the great patrons It seemed
to be either Rubens or nobobdy. Tho
other painters. Irrespective of their mer
its", were apparently grouped In a class
by themselves, and although Van Dyck
was a master, his talents were lost sight
of In the terrific vogue enjoyed by his
teacher. For a while he was put to it to
know what to do; no patrons came his
way, rave perhaps one or two s' vulgar
and purseproud that Van Dyck declined
to consider their commissions. It was
Rubens who came to his relief, first of all
by purchasing liberally of his pictures
and secondly by taking his departure on
a diplomatic mission to the courts of
Madrid and London, thus leaving thÂ«Â»
field to Van Dyck, easily the next beat
, painter of the time.

SCCW TnnK. Dec. 4.â Th* weakness of,
stocks to-< Jay wai a rcFpon?e to the world-wide
tightness in money. a marK effect wn also
produced by the Supreme Court decision. In
the Addystone pipe case, involving an Infringe
ment of the anti-trust law I. industrial com
bination*. Strenuous effort! were m.-. by
professional operator* to belittle the force of
thli decision on the ground that the party to
the case rÂ«Â« a particularly flagrant Jllustra
tlrn of a trurt forrnatlon and the points In the
ca*e could not apply to the general run of ln
<!uMr!al combinations, but the acute effect
produced on the securities of Umm combina
tion* argued an apprehension on the part of
the holder* that tliiir value would be impaired
by the decision, stocks of the- industrials fell
anywhere from 1 to 4 or 3 imlnu, and showed
but a feeMe rallytn* power.
In fact there seemed to be no resistance at
any point In the markrt. There wan ecme early
strength In Ilurl'.r.gton. tomr of the iron and
â¢â¢Ml stock*. Pacific Mall. Great Northern pre
ferred sjjd Unsred. but with the downward
court* there was practically no lnterruptkn
and the close was Â«t the lowert. and the ma
jority of the active rtorks thowed net iJJjL
of a point or over. Hupar was conspicuously
weak and is over 3 points lower on thf day
There was some thnrt felling among the in
durtriala on the stn-nrth of the Supreme Court
decision, but protu-takln* waa larrtly
for the lonÂ« account .-,,; waa very manifest
from the marked weakness in stocks which
have recently advanced notably the trunk
line,*, 'â 'Â»â¢ Pacifies and Sugar. The apprehen
â¢lon over money affairs turned prlncli>ally to
Joretcn markets, especially to Berlin and
lam The advance in the sterllnr rate at
those points to very near the gnld export level
marked the influence of the rtank of Eng
land' â¢ measures to attract funds. The ster
ling exchange rate In New York also ndvanced
liut the mrney rate both in Paris ar.d Kerlln
remained quiet, contrary to th* fear* of the
speculative world. The stacnatlon of ejjecu
latlon at those centers probably had to dn
with this remit. In New York, on the con
trary, the money rate stiffened es the day
progressed and Curried to 1J pÂ«r cent, at which
point it closed. No loans were made betiw 6
per cent. Some of the borrowers, coutuias
upon an easy money market following Satur
day's strong bank statement, delayed supply
lnjr until late m the day and so bid up the
late Ihe strength of Saturday's bank state
irent li seen to t.e traceable to a single in
> tltut'.nn. as was the care latt week. Moreover
'he *Ã¼b-Trearory operations, from which the
whole of last week* rash recuperation was de
rived, chows rains by the sub-Treasury at
the expense of the banks since" last Friday of
f1.2T4.000. Offerings of bonds for redemption
at the sub-Treuury have fallen to so low a
point as to afford only a cllcht offset to the
absorption of funds In the taking up of the
surplus revenues. On the other hand. Interior
exchtxecs moved alicbtljr In favor of New
York. The speculative putt!:, however, hat
al-and I hope of any easier money condi
tions until after the end of the year.
Ra'.lroad bonds were easier In sympathy with
â trckn. United Elate* 2s. new 4s and Ss ad

WHEAT- Futures did better. In sympathy
with Chicago. The spot market was undis
turbed.
Chicago was dull, but the feeling was some
what better. Futures at Liverpool and Paris)
were weaker, but later cables were firmer.
There was no pressure to sell. A decrease of
(.8,000 bushels In the visible supply, while small,
was a change from the weekly increase of the
post few months. There was besides a decrease
of 1,700,000 bushels on passage. The world's
shipments for the v.Â»-*k were 5.600,000 bushels.
Heavy shipments for export from Duluth and
the Canadian lake ports were reported, and 50,
000 bushels were taken at Chicago. There was
also a better cash demand.

the side of the prude, and men. wagon and
horses rolled down the embankment to
gether. McVea. who was driving, was
pinioned in the narrow creek bed under
one of the horses, their bodies thus dam
ming the stream, which speedily formed a
pool in which the young man was nearly
drowned before his half-dazed and badly
shaken up companions were able to ex

Alameda County News
THE LITTLE BOY WHO WAS
ARRESTED BY HIS FATHER
T ITTLE Willie Erlckson Is still in the Oakland City Prison upon the
I charge of petty larceny preferred by his father, City Prison upon the
charge Â«'f petty larceny preferred by hli father. Police Judge Smith
I and Prosecuting Attorney Abe P. Leach have taken an Interest in the
boy, and an effort is to be made to find him a home whore he will be
given an opportunity to prow up without the stigma of a prosecution for
theft against him. !$â¢?&Â« â¢ â 
This case Is remarkable not alone for the fart that it is a prosecution of
a child by his own father, but because of the tender years of the boy. He is
not yet 10 years of age. and he is afraid to go home to his rents and afraid
to go to the Whittler Reform School, to which place his father is seeking
to send him. All of the officials at the City Prison and the Police Court
have taken an Interest in the lad, and they are using their jjreatest endeav
ors to save him from a disgrace which might injure him in the future.
When the case was called In the Police Court this morning Police Judge
Smith refused to allow the boy to plead guilty, which he was ready to do.
11. â¢ admitted taking the money from his father, but the Judge refused to allow
him to *-iitÂ»-r any plea, and after letting the boy tell his story on the stand
he continued the case a day.
"Yen, I took the money," said the little fellow, looking up at Judge Smith
and screwing his list into his eyes with the beginning of a Whimper. "I took
the money to get clothes with. I wanted to get clothes enough to be able to go
to school, and I spent the money for Just that. George Wright told me how
to break into the trunk, and we got 520. George took $10 and I took $10.
Out of that I bought a suit that coat $1 25. but it wasn't any good and tore.
1 paid 25 cents for a cap and 25 cents for a tie. and 50 cents for a shirt and .
$1 50 for shoes. Then my brother got 14 60, and the rest I spent at the Stee
plechase in San Francisco.
"Papa don't give us enough clothes or enough to eat. He beats my
mother and throws knives at her. and make* her Bleep out in the barn with
me. He nearly broke her arm last Christmas. He threw one of my Bisters out
of the house, and she Is now working in a family. One of my brothers helps
support the family, and he tried to throw him out I don't want to go to
Whittler. I want to go to school, and I'll be a good boy if you'll let me go.
I won't take anything moreâ honest. I won't."
The father was around the City Hall this morning, but he did not make
his appearance anywhere during the proceedings. He wants the boy sent
to Whittler.
"The boy. is hard to manage." said Eriekson. "and I want 1 him sent to
Whittier. He steals things and runs away, and I took this step because I was
forced to."
Policeman Kyte was detailed to Investigate the case, and reported that on
the night that the boy was arrested the mother slept out in the barn on an old
sofa, just as the boy stated, and the boy slept under the sofa. The family
seems terrorized by the father, for one of the children was crying for some
thing to eat. and the policeman found a. bag of apples. "Give one of them
to the child." he suggested. "No. don't," replied the mother. "Those apples
belong to him. and he may have counted them."
Judge Smith thinks that a home in the country can be found for the boy.

NEW YORK, Dec. 4.â The actual trial

"MOTHER EARTH"
WARMLY RECEIVED
AT THE ALCAZAR
Features of Francis
Powers' New Play.
In the production of Francis Powers'
j "Mother Earth" there was the promise of
. Importance, for we had not forgot the
promise of his "First-Born," yet must I
; say that "Mother Earth" was a success
j beyond my hopes, for while it proves that
I the author persists In his faults it proves
i too that he knows the value of his virtues.
| Undoubtedly Francis Powers has a man
ner; his touch is unmistakable. He has
originality, though without scope, which
lack is manifest in the frequent reminders
'of "The First-Born" that occur in
l "Mother Earth." The development of his
plot depends largely upon the gossip of
minor characters, a dangerous expedient.
He is given also to the pantomimic epi
sode, which, in excess, distorts rather
: than harmonizes. A first performance is
properly the moment for suggestion, and
â¢ If Mr. Powers will take to bed with him
' these friendly hints I shall not have writ
ten in vain.
One may overlook the incongruity of the
language in which he makes his charac
ters speak, for Mexicans in Mexico
speaking broken English Is not precisely
consistent. A semi-literal translation of
' the southern tongueâ always within the
limits of dignityâ may be used to advan
tage to preserve the color and tone of
scenic environment. l would state, how
ever, that such transpositions of adjective
I and noun as "the friend distinguished"
do not assist one in the serious con
sideration of a serious play.
The first performance of this last effort
of Powers' was painstaking and honest,
and I may sprinkle praises on the cast
without fear of falling amiss. Ormonde
in the part of Manuel Quinterro was re
1 moved from his usual primacy, though
not so much from any failing on his pad
as by the general excellence of his fellow
players. His Is not â  big part, nor, mi
i deed, are any of the parts monstrous, and
i when I say that the best acting wfcMkme
in the slenderest roles I may bo giving
some idea of how admirable is the per
formance as a whole. â 'â¢ â  - .
Miss Crosby was Carmenesque as Caro
! lina and Miss Fallon as an old Mexican
woman was In excellent character. Frank
Denithorne overacts and is too conscious,
but ho may be tamed in time. This ap
plies also to George Webster, though
there are credit marks duo to both of
these
A part of the programme that I was
nigh t.i passing over was the Incidental
! music by Emlle Bruguiere. which served
i no Important purpose (incidental music
never does) and was lacking in character
and Intel . , Â«
"Mother Earth" was preceded by a
farce, "Up to Watkins." which should not
keep any one away from the Alcazar.
PORTER GARNETT.
Grand Opera-House.
/ Once more the Grand Opera-house gave
hospitality to the work of local compos
, ers. This time It was the comic, opera
entitled "His Majesty." by H. J. Stewart
'â  and Peter Robertson. While it is rather
difficult to forrfl a decisive opinion from
a firs*, hearing, and especially when this
i first hearing was at a first production, it
: was easy to observe that the music and
libretto were worthy of earnest approval.
In fact, the idea which underlies this
story Is exceedingly ingenious. â¢ An al
most bankrupt country advertises for a
cheap king (S6O per week), who because of
this insignllicant stipulation is hardly
able to exist. In the midst of his starv
ing condition the crown prince of a
wealthy empire is announced, and there
Is no court to receive him. Fortunately, a
stranded opera company arrives in the
capital, and the king promises to be pres
ent at the performance as a drawing card
provided the company acts as his court
during the option of the crown prince.
With this there is Interwoven a love story
which it is not necessary to discuss.
The gist of the plot lies in the idea of a
hired king, and this naturally gives room
for many humorous situations, which
Robertson was careful to emphasize, bo
we find in the second act the king and
queen "cleaning house." And yet the ma
terial is so good that there could be Still
more fun Introduced, especially in the
first act, which seems rather long drawn
William Woolf as the king did not do
full Justice to the splendid role be as
1 sumed. Neither could Ilattie Bell l>add
grasp the exceedingly delicate character
istics of a stranded "prima donna asso
luta " This in itself is a role which could
bo made exceedingly humorous, but which
in the hands of Mis* l.add lost all bur
lesque quality. Far better than the con
ception of Miss l.a.'.d was the Work of
Ethel Strachan. who impersonated the
soubrette of the opera company with
much ingenuity. She ought to receive
1 more prominence in the Grand Opera
house company. \
Bessie Fairbairn as the queen; Edith
Mason, Winfred Goff and Thomas liersse
gave very satisfactory renditions of their
respective roles. The music is throughout
"chic." I want to call especial attention
to the finales and to the ensemble music
in general. 1 am now .more than eve con
vinced that Mr. -wart is leaning t yard
the serious side of composition, andfj am
sure he would make a success of grand
opera. Jl
The best points in this opera are the se
rious passages. The quartets, qu \ *"*-'
and trios and one or two arias, toj \
with the finales, prove the truth o j
assertion. A Very funny idea wa. ;
burlesque of the opera company, wl
a great credit to Stage Manager . j
The same may be said of the march
pages, which the music by Mr. Bu-
I fits admirably. The piece is well n *
ed and In .one or two more days y \
t doubt become a very favorite entt J
ment. It is really worth while see s

DRINK PREVENTS A CRIME.
R. A. Jordan, a former citizen of Baa
Francisco, has been arres.ed in the City
of Mi xico on a charge of attempted
murder. One night last wÂ«ek he called
Mrs. Hegeman, widow of a Mexican rail
road contractor, to her bedroom door, and
drawing a pistol lired twice at her, both
shots failing of thÂ»ir effect. Jordan met
Mrs. Hegeman several months agn while
on a baslneM tri]> in Mexico. He and
lira. Jordan, who accompanied him, Oo
not seem to have got along very well to
gether, and .1 short time after their :ir
rival his wife left for her home in this
city, giving him to understand that she
should institute divorce proceedings.
After his wife's departure Jordan paid
marked attentions to Mrs. Hegeman, and
thi-ir marrlagi was set for October, when
the widow received a letter from Mr.;.
Jordan, which was the Oral Intimation
She baa Of that lady's existence. Upon
this she postponed the marriage, and this

started him to drinking. Half crazed by
bad whisky he attempted to kill the
woman he loved l>ut could not marry.
When Mrs. If.ppman saw his des]
intention she Red to the street, and her
cries attracting the gendarmes, Jordan
w;is placed In jail, where he ts now
awaiting trial.
Previous to Jordan's attack on Mrs.
Hegeman he had made a will leaving *aif

HUNTINGTON FINISHES
A NEW GIGANTIC DEAL
Buys an Enormous Block of Stock
From General Hubbard.
Financiers and Railway Men Wonder
What May Be the Meaning of the
Sensational Purchase.
The Two Men Who Handled the Sale of the Last Big Block of Southern
Pacific Stock to the Huntington Interests.
NEW YORK, Dec. 4. â The Hunting! Speyer syndicate which purchased the Crocker and
Southern Pacific stock has closed another immense deal.
It cÂ« light that General Thomas H. Huhbard f representing the original Mark
: which passed into the | m of Edward Searles, has sold to the syndicate one
hundred and forty thousand shai Southern Pacific Company stock at a price approximating
per shai 1
.tions were begun at the time Mrs. Stanford sold her stock, but the transac
nducted with the utmost secrecy, (ieneral Hubbard still represents as many shares
of stock as he - the syndicate, and will not relinquish his position as first vice president ot
mthern Pacific.
â¢okcr will leave here in a few days. IK- will go to San Francisco via Xew Or
:rncy inspect the property of the Pacific Improvement Company.
ThÂ« fnregolng message, received nt a
Into hour last night, was corroborated by
r>rivatÂ« dispatches from New York. Th*
â¦ xact figure which Huhbard received for
the Sea.rlÂ«-s stock is not given, but it va
ries only a fraction of a dollar from ?40.
It Is clear, therefor*, that the syndi
cate orgar.li.-d hy Speyer and Hunting
ton ha* Invested an additional lum of five
and a half million dollar* in Southern Pa
cific,
In well posted railway circles it is said
that CV>l!ls P. Huntington regards Gen
eral Hubbard as an exceptionally able
man. whoso services cannot well be
spared. ThÂ« general's superior ability was
displayed In i-lar.nir.g ttnd executing the
reorganisation schema. No doubt It is Mr.
Huntlngton'n desire that General Hubbard
âº hail recall a big block of stock, and con
tinue his service 1n the management of
thÂ« bis corporation.
VThen tno stock owned by th<Â» Crocker
Estate Company was bought by the
Speyer pyndlcai<\ the public conjectured
that C. P. Huntington simply desired to
pet In position to manage affairs of the
company to suit himself, hut when The
Call published exclusively the Intelligence
that tho syndicate had purchased all of
Mrs. Stanford's stock In the corporation
It became obvious to the popular mind
that the Frhome represented something

New York will Involve an Inspection of
the town sites, coal mines, hotels, lands

Pacific Improvement Company. The af
fairs of the company will be closed up

Mr. Crocker, whose Interests are merged
with those of the Crocker Estate Com

HORSEFLESH IN
PUCE OF BEEF
IN THE BOLOGNA
Sausage Dealers Are
Guilty.
TWO MORE IN POLICE COURT
HEALTH BOARD CHEMIST TES-
XIIIES AGAxNST THEM.
Charles 'Wachter, a sausage manufac
turer at 247 Third street, and Louis Laub
ccher, keeper of a delicatessen store at
161 Ninth street, were found guilty yester
day morning In Police Judge Conlan'B
court, the one for manufacturing sausage
out of horseflesh, the other for keeping
such sausage on sale.
Wachter and Laubscher are brothers-in
law, and, as was explained on the stand,
have a family agreement that all sausages
sold in the Ninth-street delicatessen store
shall be purchased from the Third-sir--'
factory. Both men were arrested last
month by Officer Butterworth of the
Health Department, following a seizure
made at their places of business by City
Veterinary Surgeon O'Rourke and Health
Inspector Stewart.
On v " the stand yesterday O'Rourke and
Stewart testified that they had seized
sausftge supposed to be bologna and
frankfurter in Laubschsr*S store, and had
taken from YVnchter's factory some
minced sausage-meat, two pieces of meat
not minced and two sausages in casings.
All these seizures they marked for identi
fication and turned over for analysis to
Dr. Bothe, chemist to the Board of
Healui.
Dr. Bothe, on taking the stand, said that
he haa analyzed some of the seizures and
in thÂ«Â»n had found glycogen and was pre
pared"to say that these samples contained
â¢flesh. Glycogen, he explained, was
I In the livers of all animals, but in
esh of only oneâ the horse. He had
ted the meat samples to the only
n chemical test*â nitric acid and
â and had found it present. He was
directly whether he would say posl
that the samples in which he had
thÂ«Â» glycogen contained horseflesh.
s, Fir. he answered; "they con
i horseflesh." N
-ross-examlnation the attorneys for
jfense tried to shake his testimony
ding him if it was not possible that
might have been chopped up in thÂ«
but he said again positively that he
not be mistakenâ ft was horseflesh.

â scher admitted that he worked for
e-maker Dutche. who recently

esh for beef in sausages, but denied
I had ever purchased or taken any
â¢â¢ from Deutche's factory to sell at
ire. Wachter denied that he had
manufactured any sausage from
esh.
the defense had submitted several
s for dismissal of the charges and
â¢errulod by Judge Conlan, the cases
Ã¼bmitted without argument. Tho

BALDWIN HOTEL
SITE BOUGHT BY
JAMES L. FLOOD
Nearly Million and a
Half Paid.
The Baldwin Hotel site, concerning the
disposal of which there has been so much
talk and speculation during the
year, has at last been sold by Thomas
Maget & Sons, representing E. J. Bald
win, to James 1,. Flood for H.425.00Q
When Mr. Baldwin refused to ratify the
first sale or agreement to sell made some
WÂ«l ks an", it was feared that a long an-i
vexatious lawsuit would result. Thi3
possibility has been avoided and the wait
Just consmmated was largely the
of the efforts of Judge Tobin of the
Hlbernla Bank, which Institution holds a
mortgage on Baldwin's properties for
ll.tioti.wi. Judge ToMn urged a com
promise, and his advice has been listfiieii
to with the result that an arrang<
satisfactory to all parties Interested in
the deal has been perfected.
By the terms of the sale as finally
agreed upon Mr. Flood becomes the pos
sessor of the entire site formerly occupied
by the hotel, having a frontage of 20j feet
< n Market and Eddy streets, IT.', feet on
Powell and 137:6 on Ellis street. By the
terms of thÂ»* first agreement, whicn Mr
Baldwin refused to sanction. Mr.
was to pay J1. 100.000 for the Market an.i
Eddy street fn ntage and 175 fe-t on
Powell street. Mr. Baldwin retaining tht
Powell and Ellis street corner, with a
100-foot frontage on the former and IJ7:<>
en the latter.
As the matter stands now, Mr. Baldwin
surrenders all his interests in the prop
erty mentioned, but retains the property
known as the Baldwin Annex, which he
has all along refused to put on the mar
ket.
Mr. Flood could not be seen last night,
but It is stated on the highest authority
that he will at once begin the erection of
a fine modern building on the site that
will he a credit to the city and fully in
keeping with the splendid location he has
secured. There have been numerous ru
mors as to the character of the build
ing he would erect provided the deal went
through, and the one that has received
the most credence Is that he will put op
h magnificent hotel hufdtng to cost In the
neighborhood <.f 0,009,000.
Whether the structure that will adorn
the site be â  hotel or office building, how
ever, the fact remains that the unseemly
eyesore that at present defaces the corner
of Market, Eddy and Powell streets will
soon be wiped oat of existence.

A BEGGAR IN LUCK.
His Case Dismissed and a Subscrip-
tion Raised for Him.
Henry Moore, a gray-haired old mnn,
appeared In Judge Graham's court yes
terday to answer a charge of begging,
He was arrested Sunday at Butter and
Polk streets by Policeman Collins. The
old man told the Judge that he was at
one time wealthy but had been unfor
tunate in speculating in stocks. H e had
two sons In the Klondike and he ex
pected them home soon with lots of
money. The charge against him was dis
missed and a collection was taken up in
court for him. He went away happy
with $1 '<â¢> in his pocket. *
This is not the first time that Moore has
been arrested for begging. Policeman
Leonard on May 21 last arrested Moore
and charged him with vagrancy, and In
Judge Mogans court the next day the
officer testified that Moore was in the
habit of standing In front of the Occi
dental Hotel and the Lick House and so
liciting alms from the people passing in
and out. Moore told Judge Mogan â¦he
same story that he told Judge Graham
yesterday, and the Judge dismissed the
case on Moore's promise to keep away
from Montgomery street.
â  On the day Moore's case was dismissed
Judge Mogan received a letter from
Frank Van Tassel. 26S Eleventh street
which said. "Please send Colonel Moore
to me and I will assist him, as I know
that he Is telling the truth." Moore
peemed pleased, and got Van Tassel's ad
dress from the Judge and promised to
call on him.

NOT STARVED TO
DEATH IN THE
TARTAR'S CABIN
End of the Collins
Sensation.
INVESTIGATOR'S REPORT IN
DISPOSES OF ALL THE SEBIOUS
ALLEGATIONS.
The Investigation into the treatment of
Mrs. Collins upon the transport Tartar
Is finished. The report of Major Galla
gher, in whose hands the investigation
was left, is in. and it punctures the cheap
sensation it was hoped could be built upon
the affair. There was no starvation;
there were no blows nor bruises; there
was no neglect and there was no mis
treatment. There was no occasion for
charges, and there will be no courts-mar
tial. The attempt to make a sensation
out of the whole affair has ended as so
many other such attempts have failed,
and for the same reason. There was
nothing in it from the start.
It was true- Mrs. Collins did not eat
much on the transport; but neither did
any of the other Beasick passengers, all
of them in much better health than she
was too. And after Mrs. Collins came
ashore and was provided lor at the houae
of Mrs. Brett, she did not eat either,
and food had to be forced upon her. It
was true Airs. Collins did not have the
constant attendance of a trained nurse
while she was on the transport, but it
Is also true she refused, in a manner that
left no opportunity for further advances,
all offers of assistance from the other
ladies on the vessel. She had on her per
son Jewels and money to the value of
many thousands of dollars, but these
were taken in charge by the captain of
the transport, and by him were turned
over to her relatives after she landed.
She was not robbed of $300 as was stated.
Major Gallagher examined a Miss Kerr,
Mrs Clay, the stewardess of the Tartar;
Dr Glrard, commandant of the general
hospital and the physician who attended
Mrs Collins after she arrived here. Dr.
Everetts. Mrs. Funston, who came homo
on the Tartar: Lieutenant Colonel Bay
llss of the Tennessee Regiment, who gave
up his stateroom to Mrs. Collins, and
others. Their testimony was all of the
same character.
The charges or complaints did not come
from Mrs. Brett, as people were led to be
lieve but from a Bister of the dead
woman. That they were unfounded no
one who knows of the conditions obtain
ing on board a crowded transport ever
doubted. It was a mistake for the woman
to travel on the vessel at all. but if she
had been left alone In Hongkong, sick in
body and sick In mind, more serious
charges even than those preferred would
have probably gone on to "Washington. She
could not be left behind, no she was taken
along and the best care possible on a
transport designed to carry only well
men not sick women, was accorded her.
That the transport Itself was not the best
was a misfortune, but the result would
have been the same. That Is the drift of
the report, and that is practically the end
of the affair. ......
The last of the Forty-ninth will leave
the Presidio this morning, and with them
will end the era of volunteers that has
made the Presidio so attractive to the
many ever sine** the war with Spain made
the canvas cities spring up. The Forty
eighth, tied up with smallpox on Angel
Island. Is still to go. but It will not come
over to this *lde again. It will be em
barked from the island.
Just when this will be is a problem, but
one that will be solved within twelve
days, for In that time. If there are no
more cases, the quarantine will bo de
clared off. There are seven cases now.
and it is nine days since one has devel
oped, so twelve days more without an
other case will free the men. The situa
tion at the dententlon camp at the Pre
sidio remains unchanged.
Father McKlnnon, now a chaplain in
the regular army, has been ordered to
proceed to Manila by the transport Sher
man, which will sail to-day.
The trial of Chaplain Shields did not
proceed yesterday, as was expected, for
neither side of the case Is quite ready. It
will probably go on to-morrow.
