LONDON, Nov. 1. â An ominous curtain has again de
scended upon affairs in Xatal. No dispatch except the
official telegrams ot General Sir George Stewart White
has thus far been permitted to mention the disaster at Lady
smith Monday, and no telegram from Ladysmith has been re
ceived in London since the advices from the British com-
mander. Thi rise to a belief that communications have
already been cut. in which event some time must elapse before
details regarding British losses are received.' If the War Office
officials have received information on this point they have re
frained from publishing it. General White's estimate that the
British losses were about ninety is evidently quite separate from
the probable losses in killed and wounded among the captured
battalions.
After the receipt of General White's report of the disaster to
the British arms and the capture by the Boers of two regiments
and a Mountain Battery all sorts of reports were circulated
here. One report, which tame from Gape Town, stated that
fighting was resumed at Ladysmith yesterday (Tuesday). This
report stated: "A battle is proceeding at the foot of Umban
bane. a few miles from Ladysmith. Seventy shells have dropped
into the town."
Varied speculations are made in the newspapers as to the
British losses by the Ladysmith disaster. An unofficial state
ment places the number of men at fully 2000, while other re
ports cut the figure to 1460 and point out that both the cap
tured regiments had been in action before and had lost many
men. Then great hope is pinned to the fact that the paucity of
officers officially reported wounded does not indicate the num
ber killed, but would show that the "losses are not extreme.
( > r.e special from Ladysmith says the Boers suffered se
verely during the engagement, some estimating their loss at
900 killed and wounded.
Another report is current that General White may retire to
Pietermaritzburg while the railroad is intact. There is much
divergence of opinion in military circles as to the advisabilitv of
such a step.
Still another rumor is that General White is to be relieved
of the chief command in Natal.

WHITE'S CANDID REPORT OF THE DISASTER
FOLLOWED BY CONSTERNATION IN ENGLAND.
LONDON, Oct. a.â The War Office received a dispatch from Lieutenant General White, commanding
the British forces at Ladysmith. reporting that the Royal Irish Fusiliers, No. 10 Mountain Battery
and the Gloucestershire Regiment wore surrounded in the hills by Boers, and after losing heavily
obliged to capitulate. General White adds that the casualties are not yet ascertained
Appended is the text of General Whites' dispatch to the War Office:
LADYS/VHTH, Oct. 30, 10:45 p. m.-I have to report a disaster
to the column sent by me to take a position on a hill to guard the
left flank of the troops. In these operations to-day the Royal Irish
Fusileers, No. 10 Mountain Battery, and the Gloucestershire Regi
ment were surrounded in the hills, and after losing heavily had to
capitulate. The casualties have not yet been ascertained.
A man of the Fusileers, employed as a hospital orderly, came
in under a flag of truce with a letter from the survivors of the col
umn, who asked for assistance to bury the dead. I fear there is no
doubt of the truth of the report.
I formed a plan in the carrying out of which the disaster oc
curred, and lam alone responsible for the plan. There is no blame
whatever to the troops, as the position was untenable.
General Whit* In a subsequent dispatch says:

BRITONS STAGGERED BY THE NEWS OF THE DISASTER.
LONDON, Oct. 31.â While minor reverses were not wholly unexpected, nothing like the staggering
blow General Joubert delivered to General White's forces yesterday was anticipated. The full extent of
the disaster is not yet acknowledged. If it Is known at the War Office. The loss in effective men must
bo appalling to a general who is practically surrounded. Two of the finest British regiments and a mule
battery deducted from the L,adysmith garrison weakens it about a fifth of its total strength and alters
the whole situation very materially in favor of the Boers, who have again shown themselves stern fighters
and military strategists of no mean order. The disaster cost the British from 1500 to 2000 men and six
seven-pound screw guns, and as the Boer artillery is already stronger than imagined, the capture of these
guns will be a great help to thÂ» Boers.
Further news must be awaited before It Is attempted to flx tho blame where It belongs. Genera!
White manfully accepts all the responsibility for the disaster, which apparently was at least partly due to
the stampeding of thu mules with the guns.
From the Jist It will be seen that forty-two officers were made prisoners, besides a newspaper corre
spondent. J. Hyde.
Tho interest in tha news was universal, pervading all classes and conditions of London's populace
The newspaper extras were eagerly read in business houses, in the streets and by women in their car
riages.
Then there was a rush to the War Office, which by noon was surrounded by private carriages and
hansoms, while many of the humbler class of people came on foot, all waiting and watching for the names
they held dear. Never was the old saying. "Bad news travels quickly." bettor exemplified here than to
day. By noon gloom and bitter Borrow prevailed throughout the British metropolis.
At the Government offices no effort was made to conceal the feeling of dismay prevailing. One offi
cial said to a correspondent: "It is inexplicable, and T am sorry to say that its moral effect is inestima
ble. We have lost heavily In many wars and have had regiments .almost wiped out; but to have regiments
captured, and by the Boers, it is terrible."
The disaster had an Immediate effect on the Stock Exchange, where consols fell %. South African
securities dropped heavily, Rand linos falling two points. Rio Tintos fell %.
The throngs of visitors at tho War Office remained all day. Anxious people practically fought
their way to the notice board. Most affecting scenes were witnessed. Many women were hoard to
gasp, "Thank God. he"s alive, at ;uiy rate: 1 v they found the name of some beloved one on the' list of
prisoners. The sidewalks were packed with solid masses awaiting their turn to enter.
There wns a continuous stream of callers at tho War Office until a late hour, everybody anxiously
Inquiring regarding yesterday's casualties, but the War Office declared that nothing had been received since
Sir George White's dispatch communicating the news of the capture of the Royal Irish Fusileers and
the Gloucestershire regiments.
This delay In getting further Intelligence is attributed in part to the breakdown of the East Coast
cable; but it stands to reason that the War Office must be possessed of further news which it is nrohahlv
not thought advisable should be published yet. ' uÂ»uiy

Sir George White's honest admission of full responsibility and the terms of his dispatch are re
garded in some circles as virtually placing his case in the hands of the home authorities and it Is
even rumored late this evening that the War Office has already decided to supersede him The report
however, is discredited In well informed quarters. ******
. About 6000 fresh troops will arrive at Cape Town on Sunday next from England and will be avail

of next week 28,000 troops will have been landed in South Africa. These men are Intended for General
Sir Redvers Buller's army, but they will undoubtedly be sent to Natal if the situation there should be

* TREPARATIONS TO CALL OUT SECOND ARMY CORPS.
LONDON, Oct. 31.â The War Office has sent the following dispatch to General Buller:
"Three extra battalions of foot and one mountain battery with reserves will leave England dur
ing the course of ten days to make good the casualties." ,
The commander-iri-chlef, Field Marshal Lord Wolseley. has Issued an order for the mobilization b-
November 6 of the reserves of the Suffolk, Essex and Derbyshire regiments, which will be added to the
South Africa forces. ' .
LONDON, Oct. 31â The War Office has ordered the Second Army Corps to be in readiness to be called
out. . . â¢
The military officials have not yet decided whether the consummation of the plan will be necessary
but they are determined to have everything in readiness either for a demonstration in Europe of Greet
Britain's capabilities or for sending even a larger force to the scene of action.
Until the receipt of the news of the Lady smith disaster the latter course was considered out of the
question, but now there is no knowing what steps will be decided upon.
The preparation to call out the Second Army Corps, taken In conjunction with the extraordinary naval
activity here, has again aroused the belief in British circles that the Government has good reason to
anticipate European hostility. No reason to justify this latest reiteration of rumors "of Russian. French or
German Intervention can be found, however. It was learned on good authority that the motive consists to
quote an official. In wanting to "show the other fellows what we can do," and is on a line with calling
out the militia, a purely precautionary measure dictated by the necessity of bringing up the home mili
tary force to Its normal strength, or rather a strength proportionate with the necessities .of a nation en
gaged In a foreign war. Still it is doubtful, whether the Second Corps will be actually called out That
development depends on two circumstancesâ the attitude of European nations, as evinced by this
first serious British, reverse; second, upon the judgment of General Buller. who. finding the conditions not
50 favorable as expected, may demand the troops. ,
It does not follow that the entire army corps, even if called out. will be sent to General Buller It
Is more probable that It will be kept home to supply the places of units sent out in consonance with
General Buller's wishes. Upon the present organization these home forces are supposed to be capable
of raising at short notice three army corps. Should the War Office decide upon raising a second corns
It will necessitate the calling out of more reserves. v
draw upon Colenso. If the order is not
given it will be because a removal of the
stores would be too risky."
The Morning Post calls attention to Sir
George White's use of the word "capitu
lation," remarking that It suspects the
word was used carelessly. It says; "We
prefer to assume that the column fougnt
until it was cut to pieces and .all the am
munition was pone. Capitulation is a
word of shame. Troops in the field cannot
capitulate without disgrace, and disaster
is not necessarily diÃhonor."

considerable reverse. It is for the nation
to show that it can bear ill-fortune with
courage and dignity."

Chief Executive Speaks of the Nation's Present Pros=
perity and the Brilliant Outlook for
the Future.
AS THE SHUBRICK WILL APPEAR WHEN COMPLETED.
RICHMOND, Va., Oct. 81.â The tor- I
pedo-bcat Shubrick was launched
here to-day In the presence of
President McKinley, many mem
. b<>rs of his Cabinet, Governor Tyler
' of Virginia and an immense out
| pouring of people. The demonstration
was marred in some of its features by a
heavy rainstorm. The civic carnival i
parade had to be abandoned until to-mor- j
I row owing to the weather, and the deco-
J rations of the buildings presented a be
draggled and woe-begone appearance.
: Bui the people, residents as well as
i visitors from other Virginia cities and J
\ points outside, who came to witness the .
j launching and see the President, were ;
j enthusiastic.
' .The Presidential train arrived on time,
' and ns it rolled through the suburbs of
! the city '.he Howitzer Battery fired a
I Presidential salute. At the Elba station
|at the west end, where the Presi
| dent debarked and took a carriage, he
| was formally welcomed by Mayor Taylor
; and responded with a brief speech. Im-
I mediately after this ceremony the Presi
j dent and party were driven to the Jetfer
; son Hotel and held an Informal reception
j in the Franklin-street lobby of the build-
I ing. It is estimated that . 1000 persons
| shook hands with, him before he would
; permit the police to clear the way for
j him to go to his private apartments.
A little later 'luncheon was served in che
dining-rooms of the hotel, some 300
, persons sitting down, and then the Presi
; dential 1 party was driven to the shipyard,
i the President being cheered warmly along
the route. At the yard an immense crowd
I had assembled. -; The President, having
been introduced from the stand by Mayor
! Taylor, spoke as follows: ."-..-â '

BROUGHT IN MANY
SICK PROSPECTORS
Revenue Cutter Bear
Arrives at Seattle.
Special Dispatch to The CaJl.
SEATTLE, Oct. 31 âAfter a cruise in
Alaskan waters as far north as Point
Barrow, the United States revenue cutter
Bear, Captain Jarvis, returned to Seattle
to-day. She had sixty odd sick and desti
tute prospectors, gathered up at various
northland points. At St. Michaels, which
point she left October 8. the Bear took
aboard ten United States prisoners, five
of whom are accused of murder, and con
veyed them to the United States peni
tentiary at Sitka. Fifteen men who had
been ordered out of Cape Nome by the
local authorities were also brought to this
city on the Bear.^They are accused of no
particular offense other than tljat they
had no visible means of support and were,
It is said, regarded by the Cape Nome
officials as desperate men.
The Bear railed at St. George Island, on
the coast of which the steamer Laurada
lies beached. Captain Jarvis says the
Laurada's upper works are nearly all
gone, and ho thinks it improbable that
the vessel can be saved in anything like
her entirety.
MESSENGER ASSAULTED
BY A TRAIN ROBBER
DENISON, Texas, Oct. 31.â T0-night
while theMissourl, Kansas and Texas train
from Sherman, Texas, was In the city
limits, a train robber made a murderous
assault on Express Messenger Concannon,
dealing him a blow which, it is thought'
will prove fatal. When the train arrived
at the depot Conductor Romer discovered
the messenger on the floor with blood ooz
ing from a ghastly wound.
The express car was robbed of a con
siderable sum of money, but the agent re
fuses to give the amount. The Sheriff and
posse are en route to the scene of the
robbery. It Is rumored that a package
containing $5000 was taken and the olH
cers say that fully $10,000 is missing.

their efforts to increase the trade of the coun
try and find new and profitable markets for
their products. Manufacturing was never so
active and so universally enjoyed throughout
all the States.. Work was never so abundant.
The transportation companies were never so
taxed- to handle the freight offered by the
people for distribution. The home and for
eign markets contribute to our prosperity.
Happily the latter has increased without any
diminution of the former. Your locomotives
go to Russia, the witch cases from my little
city of Canton to Geneva, the bridges of Phil
adelphia span the Nile and the products of
the American farm and factory are carried
upon every sea and find welcome In most of
the ports of the world.
In what respect would we change these
happy conditions, with the promises they give
of the future? The business activity in every
part Of the country, the better rewards to la
bor, the wider markets for the yield of the
soil and the shop, the increase of our ship
building, not only for Government but for
purposes of commerce; the enormous increase
of our export trade In manufactures and agri
culture the great comforts of the home and
the happiness of the people, the wonderful up
lifting of the business condition* of Virginia
and the South and of the whole country, make I
this not only an era of goodwill, but an era of j
good times.
It is a great pleasure to me to stand in this
historic capital and to look Into the faces
of my countrymen here assembled and to feel <
and to know that we are all Americans, stand-
Ing as one for the Government we love and
mean to uphold; united for the honor of the !

- My Fellow Citizens: Two' great historical
events, Veparated by a period of eighty-four
years, affecting the life of the republic and
of awful import to mankind, took place on the
soil of Virginia. Both were participated In by j
Virginians and both, marked mighty epochs. in
the history of the nation. The one was at York- '
town In 1781, when Cornwallls surrendered to j
Washington, which was the beginning of the j
end of the war with Great Britain and the !
dawning of Independence and union. The great i
Virginian, page and patriot. Illustrious com- '
mander and wise statesman, installed the re
public in the family of nations. It has with

or within, experiencing its gravest crisis in
the Civil War. The othjr. at Appomatox. was;
the conclusion of that crisis and the beginning 'â 
of a unification now happily full and complete,

of one toward another of all the people. Wash

OPENING OF THE
SUISSER TRIAL
Only Five Jurors Have
Been Secured.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAIJXAS, Oct. 31.â The Superior Court I
room was crowded all day to-day with â¢
I resident* of Monterey County, who were
i interested in the trial of George Sulsser, ;
I the young man who on the night of Sep
tember 18 tried to annihilate the Dolaney
family, attempted to murder Constable j
Allen and committed arson on the De- j
| laney premises and did assassinate Sheriff
Henry R. Farley. Suisser has probably I
the best attorney in the county, but j
nevertheless the evidence is strong and i
public opinion so great that it is asserted !
that the Jury will not dare under oath to !
give other than a verdict of murder in
the first degree.
At 10 o'clock the case was opened and \
from that time till 5 p. m. the various at- j
I torneys and the Judge battled with jurors '
i In an effort to get twelve competent and '
i unbiased men. At the time the court
| closed for the day only five had been se- ;
1 cured. The people were represented by
District Attorney Andreasen, Deputy
I Thomas J. Rlorda'n and Thomas Renison, I
while C. F. Lace? and G. A. Daugherty !
represented the defendant.

I good jurors as the attorneys were and '
the examination was exhaustive and per
tinent. Seventy-five men were summoned, :
but from the present outlook a special

The seed of discord has no sower and no soil

Thou hast united us:

Associated with this great commonwealth
are many of the most sacred ties In our na
tional life. From here came forth many of
our greatest statesmen and heroes, who gave
vigor and virtue and glory to the republic.
For thirty-seven of the sixty-one years from
1789 to ISSO sons of Virginia occupied the Pres
idential office with rare fidelity and distinc
tion a period covering more than one-fourth
of our national existence. What nation can
have a greater heritage than such names as
Washington, , Jefferson, Madison, Monroe and
Marshall: their deeds inspire the old and the
young. They are written in our histories. They
are a part of the education of every child of
the land. They enrich the school books of the
country. They are cherished In every American
home, and will be so long as liberty lasts and
the Union endures.

the blood of the men of the South and the
North at Manila and Santiago and in Porto
Rico, have lost none of their force and virtue,
and the people of the United States will meet
their new duties and responsibilities with un
failing devotion to these principles and with
unfaltering purpose to uphold and advance
them.
Standing near the close of the century, we
can look backward with congratulations and
pride, and forward Into the new century with
confidence and courage. â  The memories of the
past Inspire, us to nobler effort and higher en

The launching: which followed was a
groat -success, the boat being christened
by little Carrie Shubrick of Rocky Mount,
N. C, great-ftrandniece of Commodore

was a side launching, but the boat took
the water like a duck, amid enthusiastic
cheering and the tooting of steam
whistles.
On the christening stand were little

boat: her maids of honor, Miss Mary

Americans.
Frederick J. Cross of the firm of Catton,
Neill & Co., engineers, of Honolulu, who
is now in this city, has closed a contract
for an American company in Hawaii. Al- :
though many engineers regarded the con
nection of the five islands by cable as
impracticable, because of coral reefs, on
which a cable is soon covered with a ooral
growth, which renders breaks frequent,
and repair exceedingly difficult, the Amer- |
lean company had about decided to at- j
tempt it, as the needs of telegraphic com- 1
munication had grown most urgent. Then
Signor Marconi's achievements were
heard of and Mr. Cross was sent to this
country to view the workings of his sys
ten^as used by The Call and Herald dur
ing the international yacht races. He
found that the Marconi system would cost '
much .less and be more practicable in
many ways than a cable. A regular tele- !
graph business will be done by the com

distances over which communication will
be established will vary from eight to six- !

MADRID, Oct. 31.â A sensation was

POLICE FORCE
IS REORGANIZED
Changes Made by Chief
Glass of Los Angeles.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LÂ£)S ANGELES, Oct. 31.â The long: her
alded Bhake-up in the Los Angeles Police
Department was this morning accom
plished by Chief of Police Glass, who is
sustains! by a majority of the Police
Commissioners. This reorganization hal
bepn expected every day for weeks, in
fact, has been on the tapis for years, and
came with no notilication and no warn
ings. The chang.-s in the personnel of the
officials of the force are radical and have
created additional bitterness and widened
the chasm that has existed in many cases
between the Chief and his subalterns.
When the orders \vr> read at this
morning's weekly meeting of the Police
Commission a debate waa precipitated
that will long be remembered in the an
nals of the body that is supposed to pre
side over the destinies of the department.
Early was it apparent that Chief Glass
would be sustained in the reorganization
of the force, as Mayor Eaton and Cora
sioner Goss openly Indorsed the Chief's
action, while Commissioners Parker and
Scarborough as openly opposed the
changes. Commissioner Pancoe took no
part in the proceedings, even declining
to vote upon the question to table the
matter for one week. While Pascoe was
with the Chief in spirit, with .subdued
mien he listened to the even-handed war
fare that raged over the contemplated re.
organization, yielding In the end and
voting with the Mayor and <soss.
That the changes were programmed by
the majority of the board is evident as
the new orders were posted on the police
station blackboard half an hour before
the contemplated changes were broached
by the Chief to the Police Commission.
By this order, now known as fatal 13
Captain W. C. Roberts is mndc sergeant
and succeeded by Officer J. A. Smith; R.
E. Cutler, secretary of police, is suc
ceeded by Officer C. R. Moffatt; Clerks
of Police S. P. Hensley, J. a. ltcan and
D. E. Grldley are deposed, and Sergeants
S. G. Morton and W. T. Jeffries suffer a
similar fate. Officers I^enhausen, Berg,
Hnk.-r and Broadhead succeed the de
posed members.
Captain Roberts has bf*en on the force
for ten years and others almost as
long. The most of these men are well
known to the members of the San Fran
cisco department.
Captain Ludlow Betires.
"WASHINGTON, Oct. 31. â Captain
Nlooll Ludlow has been retired with the
rank of rear admiral in the navy on his
own application after thirty years of

DECEASED WAS THE SON OF A
MILLIONAIRE.
â¦
Man Who Did the Killing Assaulted
by Men Who Wanted Free
Refreshments â of
the Shooting. x
Charles Hall, formerly a member of the
First Nebraska Regiment and later cook
on the transport Hancock, which Is lying
at the drydo.ck, was shot and almost in
stantly killed last night about 10 o'clock
by C. R. Dodge, an aged saloon-keeper.
Whose place of business is at 214 Fifth
avenue South, near Hunters Point. The
latter was arrested an hour later by
Lieutenant Anderson and Officer R. .T.
llanley and removed to the Central Police
Station, where a charge of murder was
placed against his name.
The prisoner, who is 73 years of age,
admitted having fired the fatal shot, but
states that he did it in self-defense- Ac
cording to his story, nine men entered
his saloon about 9 o'clock and called for
drinks. With the aid of his son Charles,
aged 21 years, he served the men with j
beer. After the second round of drinks |
had been partaken and paid for, more
liquid refreshment was called for, and for
this they refused to pay. The men be
came violent at this juncture and ordered
more liquor', but Dodge refused to serve
th<>m unless he was paid for what had
been consumed. One of the crowd vented
his ill feeling on the son by knocking him
senseless to the floor with a heavy blow
with a chair.
Th>> old man became wildly excited, as
he believed his boy had been killed, and
he started to get behind the bar where
his pistol was concealed. Another of the
crowd Beeing his Intention struck Dodge
in the mouth with a heavy instrument
and knocked a number of teeth down his
throat Although dazed by the blow the
saloon-keept-r reached his gun and lev
eled it ami fired at the man, who he
thuugnt had killed his son. At that mo
ment the crowd became frightened and
rushed out of the saloon and Dodge
slanimefl the door to and bÃrnv! It to his
assailants. The gang of roughs then be
gan to vent their anger on the old man
by stoning thn building. Every window
in the establishment was broken by the
missiles hurled by the men.
Hall was standing In the doorway of the
saloon when struck by the bullet and he
fell to the sidewalk. The leaden missile
struck him on the loft side, between the
pectoral muscle and the shoulder, and
passed through him. The pistol used by
Dodge was an old-fashioned Colt's of
forty-four caliber, and is now in the pos
session of the police.
Dodge was not aware he had killed a
man until the officers came for him. He
claimed he fired because he thought his
boy had been killed and his own life was
in danger.
The deceased is said to have been the
son of C. A. Hall, a millionaire cigar
manufacturer of New

HERSELF IN COURT
SAN JOSE. Oct. 31.â Mrs. Ruth E.
Gnetz, who is being surd for d : vorce by
her husband on the ground of cruelty,
created a scene In Judpre Hyland's depart
ment of rhe Superior Court this afternoon.
The case had been submitted and the
court was proceeding to review it. He
had reached a point where he said that
Mrs. Qoetz was 31 years old and her hus
band 24, and from the testimony it seemeu
they could not get along together, when
Mrs. Goetz sprang from her seat with a
piercing .shriek "I want my Fred! Give
me my Fred!" and before any one could
restrain her, took a two-ounce phial of
laudanum from her reticule and drank
its contents.
There was tremendous excitement in
court for a few moments, but doctors
were called, who with a stomach pump
soon pronounced the woman out of
danger.
The woman was formerly the wife of
an attorney here, but there was a divorce,
this being her second marriage.
She and her present husband have neen
in Police courts, she charging him with
battery, and he was fined. She is said to
be highly excitable.

DAMAGING EVIDENCE
AGAINST THE MINERS
MOSCOW, Idaho, Oct. 31.â The most
damaging evidence yet presented against
the men on trial for obstructing the malls
was given to-day by the witnesses for
the prosecution. Objections by Colonel
Reddy, counsel for the defense were
numerous. He exercised all of his in
genuity in cross-questioning of witnesses
In order to have them modify their state
ments and put the evidence and credulity
of the people testifying in a prejudicial
light before the Jury* The tendency of his
efforts was to impress the jury that the
witnesses we+e employes of the Bunker
Hill and Sullivan Mining Company and
depended en that corporation for a liveli
hood, and consequently deemed It policy
to give evidence in accordance with the
wishes of ibeir employers.
MURDER SUSPECT
HANGED BY MOB
Negro Strung Up to a
Telephone Pole.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WEIR CITY, Kan., Oct. 31.â Gus Me-
Ardle. a bartender in Berry Janes' resort,
was killed at 10:30 last night, and in less
than two hours his supposed murderer,
George Wells, a negro miner from Scam

reled with Wells in the saloon, after
which the negro left. Shortly afterward
a shot was fired from across the street,
the bullet striking McArdle squarely in
the forehead. He died in a half hour.
A few minutes later Wells came up In
the crowd that collected and inquired the
cause of the gathering. A spectator to
the previous trouble pointed Wells out to
an officer, who arrested him on suspicion
and lodged him in jail. Another specta
tor shortly afterward identified him as
the negro who had quarreled with Mc-
Ardle. and the report quickly spread that
Wells was identified as the man who did
the killing.
A mob formed quickly and marched to
the Jail. Securing Wells without much
trouble they dragged the frightened negro
from the building and strung him up to
the nearest telephone pole.
Before the rope was placed about his
nock Wells admitted he wan with the man
who shot McArdle, but denied that he had
done the shooting.
Intense excitement prevails and a race
war is predicted.

GENERAL TRACEY
ON THE STAND
Testifies Before Mazet
Committee.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Oct. 31.-The Mazet in
vestigating committee resumed its hear
ings to-day. General Benjamin F. Tracey
was the chief witness called and he was
examined by Counsel Moss, Committee
man Hoffman and President Grout of the
Boroue-h of Brooklyn. General Tracey
said in answer to Mr. Moss' questions
that he had been connected with the
Ramapo Water Company since 1887; that
he was its president in 1896, and that ho
had never received a compensation except
650 shares of its stock, which he had
since sold. General Tracey went on to
say that he was president of the charter
commission and was an ex-offlcio member
of the committee on drafts. He had
nothing to do, however, with the draft
ing of any part of the charter relating
to water supply.
Among other reasons he gave for re
signing the office of president of the com
pany was that he felt that no company
could advance the necessary capital to
develop it so long as one man, Mr. I^a
mont, who had induced him to become
a shareholder, retained control. In ad
dition he said that the newspapers had
begun to abuse him and to vilify him
for his partnership with Senator Platt's
son.
"I thought that, as a whole," he said,
"I would not take the responsibility of
being the head of a company that, how
ever honest it might be, would be abused
if it made a contract with the city."
Committeeman Hoffman questioned
General Tracey regarding his relations
with the Ramapo Company, in the way
of a cross-examination, and as to his re
turns as a shareholder with other com
panies. General Tracey answered all the
questions, but protested against them.
In order to ascertain just how much
money the firm named Platt, Boardman &
Tracey received from city corporations
and public departments and city officials
Mr. Hoffman requested that General
Tracey produce the books of the firm.
This General Tracey said he would not do
unless the committee requested it, and
Chairman Mazet refused to make such a
request.
MURDERESS BAAGO
DESTROYED HERSELF
SAN PABLO. Oct. 31.â The remains of |
Mrs. Anna Baago, the Sheep Island
murderess, was found this afternoon
about 2 o'clock by A. P. Anderson, a
friend of the deceased. Anderson had
been on Sheep Island for a few days look
ing for the remains, and to-day at low j
tide discovered the feet of the woman
sticking out of the water near a small
wharf from which she jumped.
Around the neck of the woman was I
found a rope, to which was attached a
piece of iron weighing twenty-five or
thirty pounds. Thp knots in 'the rope |
were very secure, but could easily have j
been made by her own hands. The re
mains were not disfigured beyond recog
nition.
Coroner Curry was notified and took
charge of the body and brought it to San
Pablo. A jury was summoned and re
viewed the remains this evening. It is
the general impression that it was a case
Of Bldride. The inquest will be held
Thursday at 2 p. m. at San Pablo. The
body was taken to the Morgue at Martinez
on the 9:30 train this evening.
Drank Strychnine.
MARYSVILLE. Oct. 31.â Thomas Mc-
Carthy, sometimes known as Wilson, a
barber, who came to this city five years
ago from Grimes Landing. Colusa County,
committed suicide in the Golden Eagle
Hotel last Saturday night by swallowing
a decoction of gin and strychnine. Tiie
body w;u discovered last evening aid an
inquest was held by the Coronor. Mc-
Carthy was despondent as a result of an
extended rpree and the morphine habit-
POLITICAL.
CITIZENS'
NON-PARTISAN
PARTY.
FOR GOOD GOVERNMENT.
To the Voters of San Francisco: The Non-
Partisan party was organized seven years ago
to wrest from professional politicians the con-
trol of municipal affairs and to separate en-
tirely from national politics the selection of
city and county officials.
I It has at all times opposed machine politics,
| and sought to elect worthy men to office by in-
dependent nomination or indorsement.
The last Legislature passed a law expressly
aimed at the "unwelcome Interference" In
public affairs of non-partisan organizations.
The Rickard act forbids any information on the
ballot concerning the indorsements that a can-
didate may receive and makes it impossible for
a man to be nominated by two parties. Such
a creditable occurrence as the nomination last
year by the two great parties of John Lack-
mann for Supervisor could not be repeated.
We regard this law as pernicious In principle
and against public policy, and we intend to
vigorously conteEt it.
The adoption of a non-partisan charter, the
result of the last primary election, and the in-
dependent character of the recent Republican
and Democratic conventions, clearly indicate,
however, that the friends of good government
have awakened to their duties.
With these changed conditions we feel that
there Is no occasion for an entire Non-Partisan
ticket at this election.
It Is. however, a fundamental principle of
this party to support those nominees who have
faithfully and fearlessly filled their offices and
are renominated for the same office. We would
fall in our obligations were we to leave this
I work undone.
We therefore unqualifiedly remmmend for
I your suffrage at the coming election:
For Mayor JAMES D. PHELAN
For Assessor. WASHINGTON DODGE
For Auditor ASA R. WELLS
For City and County Attorney..-
FRANKLIN K. LANE
I To each of these faithful servants of the
I people there is certainly due a generous meas-
I ure of credit and encouragement, for the ablÂ«
and honest manner In which they have ful-
filled their public trust.
This committee, furthermore, realizing the
difficulty for each Individual voter to Inform
himself as to the qualifications of the many
candidates for the Board of Supervisors, has
given careful and Impartial study to th>- rela-
tive merits of the nominees on the several
tickets.
As the result of continuous work by this
! committee, extending over a month's time, re-
| garding this Important dppartment of the city
! government, we feel Justified In recommending
for your support and vote. Irrespective of
party lines, the following eighteen citizens, se-
lected from the Republican and Democratic

j visors under the new charter:

FRANK MASKEY'S LADY ROD'S CHAFF READY FOR QUAIL.
THE canyons of Marln County will reverberate with the
sound of exploding gunpowder to-day. November 1
marks the opening of the season In which quail may be
killed, and many members of the shotgun brigade will
avail of the first opportunity to secure some of these most
beautiful of game birds. Marin County will undoubtedly attract
the greatest number of gunners, as from all accounts quail are
to be found there in large numbers. A large party of Country
club members left last night for the scene of action in their
private car. The preserve of tho Tamalpais Sportsmen's Club
and that of the Olympic Gun Club will also be well patronized.

the challenger would be gratified if he
could return u> his native heath with the
winged "O's" maestro's scalp on his
belt.
Signor Pavese is acknowledged to be
one of the greatest swordsmen In the
world. He defeated such experts as Dun
can C Ross. Professor McMahon and
Captain Oscar, and is now the possessor
of the championship belt and a score of
medals as (evidence of bis prowess. Some
years ago the Italian wonder gave a prac
tical test of his endurance by fencing
for twelve hours without rest. On the
occasion mentioned he withstood the at
tack of a number of experts with credit
to himself and to - the astonishment of
thousands of spectators. A short time
ago the Italian master of the sword met
five men in succession and defeated them
all They were Professor Gerald, for
merly of the United States army; Profes
sor James Sullivan, formerly of the
United States navy; Dr. Roessler. A.
Schlauenberg and F. Eppeson, all of the

you to General Lee and Captain Sigsbee should
not g.i unanswered by the American people,
hereby agree to meet you in mortal combat,
with either sabers or foils. Neither General
Lee or Captain Slgsbee can possibly accept
your challenge because, of their duties In the
present struggle between the United State, and
Spain ami 1 as an Italian-American and nat
uralized citizen of the United States, dcs re to
put myself In the place of the great gentlemen
whom you have challenged. Should you fall to
notice my willingness to satisfy your wish for
revenge I shall stigmatize you as a coward
and challenge any other Spaniard the wide
world over who dares to insult the American
"There ought to be one among the sympathi
zers with Spain to accept my challenge; but if
not I consider you all as a grand lot of chatter-
I had the pleasure of challenging Tour Ex
cellency some days since, and offered to go to
Canada; but as yet I have received no reply.
To this second overture I hope you may be
pleased to make some speedy reply.
I subscribe myself your servant,

Gains Ten Points on Slosson in the
Second Night's Play.
NEW YORK, Oct. 31.â The second
nipht'p play in the professional cushion
carom billiard match wa.Â« a close strug
gle and the small crowd that braved tho
rain to see the experts were well repaid
for their trouble. Bchaeffer outplayed
Btoraon by Just ten points to-night, but
Slosson maintained the. load gained last
night to the end.

Ing stood '''Â«' to <96 in Blosson'a favor.
The final block of 800 points will be playe.l

brace gives his admirers ground for hop
ing that he may yet win.
SlOMon began with a lead of 115 points
and he steadily increased this until he
held an advantage of 100 caroms after
one hundred innings had beet) played.
goon after this, however, Bcha<'ffer began
slowly to overhaul his adversary. In
seven innings he gathered in no less than
ninety-six points, including one run of
thirty-five, the Highest of the evening,
and for the first time in the evening the
"Wizard" seemed to be in the hunt again,
his total being only 112 caroms behind
then.
The "Student" finished strong, however,
niiii ran the night's total out in his one
hundred ami fortieth inning with a good
beat of twenty-two wf-11-executed caroms.
His advantage was 105 points and Schaef
fer will try to make up this difference in
the final evening's play to-morrow. The

OSTLER JOE
IN FETTLE
ONCE AGAIN
Black Horse Captures a Sprint
at Oakland â Four cf the
Choices Win.
The old favorite Ostler Joe came out
from his seclusion at Oakland yesterday,
capturing a purse l for Billy Randall at
skori Odds. The race, a six-furlong sprint,
looked like "oil from the can" for the
black horse, but he was given a very
m iff argument by Alaska. On Thursday |
i ' the latter mare ran an Indifferent I
fourth in a cheap five-furlong spin with'
Coburn up, after receding In the betting'
from <i to ID. Yesterday, piloted by
Thorpe, she brought Bonder astride Joe
I" ;i bard <irlv<-, finally succumbing by a
neck only. Schiller, with Tommy Burns
in the Raddle, afeo made his first appear
.in. i- ilil.; season, finishing a fair third.
A In ivy track <li<l not seem to seriously
retard the progress of the favorites, as!
four 'â : sis s'-h 1 to the starting post were
returned winners.
I 1 A Pfanegan disposed of an ordinary
buhi h of plat i ra in the flrsl recital, a dash ;
over tin- Futurity course, without ap- I
parenl effort. With Thorpe up the chest
nut horse closed a 'â  to "> chance, winning
i<y fiv<- lengths from Honda. Master Lee
led Judge wofford, the mount of Tommy
Burns, out for the show.
For some unknown r<-nson High Hoe!
was made favorite over Jennie Held for !
ih.- six-furlong run following. The lat- j
ter man possesses more class and after
Johnny Woods extricated himself from a
pocket she won In ;i big gallop. The:
favorite to<.k the place just aliout as eas
ily from Tourist.
<>M Lovdal scored his third successive
victory in the fourth chapter, a seven
furlong jaunt. Kight to five was laid about
him in Uio ring and he paraded home,
three lengths in advance of Ringmaster. ;
Ailenna, the two-year-old, was about as
much at home in thrÂ» going as a tramp at ,
a pink tea social, finishing among the
"also rans."
(jauntier, from the Burns & Waterhouse
stable, made away with the fifth purse.
The distance was the short six-furlongÃ
and the uncertain chestnut colt won all
the way. Eight lengths away Sallie Good
win led Tullamore out for second place.
A hot tip pervaded the atmosphere on
Thorpe's mount. Mountaineer, to win the
closing five-furlongs for two-year-olds.
The Montana youngster beat the barrier,
but failed to last, cashing in early. Eddie
Jones rnd^> an almost perfect race on The
Buffoon, winning cleverly at the wire
from Bamboulia, the third choice.
TRACK NOTES.
Jockey Henry had a narrow escape from
injury in the third event. He had the
mount on Shannonette, and below the
furlong pole from home the mare swerved
across the track, breaking the inner rail,
and tossing her rider over the fence. The
boy escaped with nothing more than a
severe shaking up. and in future the en
ery of Shannonette will not be received at
Oakland.
On the way to the post for the opening
sprint Starling ran away with Garcia.
Thinking the old mare may have joined
the light artillery, her entry was also re
fused by the stewards.
Some too inquisitive visitor to the pad
dock got too close to the heels of Ostler
Joe, and now regrets it. During the pa
rade on the tanbark between bells the
black fellow let his feet By, catching the
stranger on the shoulder, placing him
hors de combat for a time.
After the sudden improvement shown
by Alaska, the entries of that mare, Snips
and February, comprising the stable of
J. S. Gibson were ordered refused by the
officials in the stand. All have been very
inconsistent performers in the past.
Jockey Coburn, who rode Alaska -tn her
race on Thursday last, was ruled off.
Bob McGlbben, the rosy-cheeked, clar
ion-voiced caller of Oakland track, has
been engaged to fill the same position at
Tan for an Park. Bob is without a peer in
this particular branch of the turf.
Tommy Burns had four mounts and was
unsuccessful in landing any one of them
over the wire first. In all fairness to
Burns, none of them looked to have a
very rosy chance, and his followers had
no "kick" coming. The Western rider's
contract with the firm of Burns & 'Water
house stable goes into effect to-day.

A representative audiences of commer

noon to listen to Colonel George \\\ Bell.
United States Consul for Sydney, N. S.
W., deliver an Interesting and Instructive
address on "The Commercial Opportuni

gentleman was introduced by Charles
Nelson, president of the Chamber of Com

-which he referred to the fact that Colonel
Bell had been selected by New South

trial Congress in Philadelphia, and ihis
of itself was sufficient to determine the
worth and ability of the man who had
been so highly honored. Mayor Phelan

After a brief review of the present com
mercial and maritime conditions that pre
vail in this country Colonel Bell said:
"Forty years ago this country built the
finest ships that over breasted the ocean;
and 75 per cent of the nation's products
were carried in American ships, amount
ing to one-third the tonnage or the world.
\\ c now carry less than 11 per cent of our
own products! We have banished our
selves from the ocean; and my patriotism
revolts at the conditions of to-day. v\ ny
is it that your commercial m*n pay al
most $300,0u0,W0 a year 10 foreign ship
owmrs to carry their products to the
point of competition?
"Why have we abandoned the seas? I
will teU you. When we were a great peo
ple and 'when the finest ships and the
American Has were found everywhere
gold was disco vend in far off California.
It was then that shipmasters and sailors
deserted their ships and plunged into the
mines. Commercial people left off all
ideas of foreign trade and crossed the land
in search of pay dirt. Industry was ex
erted in interior development and we
opened our arms to all the world. Now
that the interior has been developed bet
ter than any country in the world a
change in the old policy is required. We
must look abroad to -improve industrial
conditions. The great American stomach
will not hold the American crop. We pro
duce one-third more of the utilities of life
than docs England. But we are not the
only nation that produces a great sur
plus. We must specialize, organize and
concentrate in this age of progress. While
we are (Striving to get into other markets
we must remember that other nations are
doing the same thing. Without a sail to
carry the surplus the people who produce
it must remain Idle. In this war of com
petition it is absolutely necessary to get

CAHILL'S MISFORTUNES.
Bereft of Wife and Child Within the
Short Period of Three Weeks.
.T..hn Cahill, whose 2-year-old child,
Margaret Cahill, died from sickness and
â¢ at 920 Bryant street last Monday
morning, made a pitiable exhibition of
himself in thÂ«^ corridor outside the Coro
ner's office yesterday morning. An in
was being held on the body of the
baby, and Cahill, maudlin from the ef
â â â !' liquor, was wailing and lamenting
his loss so loudly that the Coroner was
obliged to postpone the inquest until this
morning at 1 11 "'clock.
Cabill was more pitied than blamed by
the bystanders when they learned that
his wife had die.l only three weeks ago.
He was so much affected by his loss that
he took to drink and had not recovered
from the effects of the debauch when the
1 misfortune came upon him. Mrs.
l >r. Judell was called In last Friday and
found the child seriously ill and In want
of many necessaries. She provided some
erps and Other food and made provision
ts ''are. The father at the time was
helplessly Intoxicated. When the baby
died Dr. Judrll reported the case to the
t Joroner.
The remaining child, a boy, was taken
sick yesterday. CahiH'a friends promised
the Coroner that they would try to gel
â  him sober by this morning, so that he
Vi testify at the Inquest.
An autopsy was performed on the re
: mains by Dr. Zaoala lasl evening. The
ment that the child had been ne
â¢ d and starved to death by an in
human parent was verified and inanition
was Riven as the cause of death on the
; autopsy certificate.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 1, 1899.
PARALYTIC BERRY
CREMATED IN BED
WILLIAM BERRY, so badly paralyzed as to he unable to stir a finger
to save himself, was burned to death in his bed yesterday morning
at the residence of his brother-in-law, Frank White, 2612 Lombard
street.
Mr. White is a soldier at the Presidio, several blocks away, and was do
inp sentry duty at the time the house was burned, Between 7 and 8 o'clock In
the morning he was notified by a neighbor that his house had been on fire
and that most of its contents had been destroyed. He was relieved to learn
that his wife Catherine and his 4-year-old daughter has escaped unscathed.
Mrs. White attended the inquest held by Coroner Hill yesterday morning.
She seemed heartbroken over the loss of her brother, and Matron Harris was
called upon more than once to console the affltcted woman. She said that
she took her brother home from an asylum at Stockton last Saturday. She
wanted him with her because she thought she could take better care of him
than he was getting in the institution at Stockton. Mr. Berry was paralyzed
so badly that he could scarcely articulate, and he was brought to the house
on a stretcher in a hospital ambulance.
A bed was made up for him in a small room adjoining the kitchen which
was covered with a shed roof, and on last Monday he appeared to be gaining
strength. On that night before retiring Mrs. White built a coal fire in the
stove for the double purpose of taking the chill off the air and of drying some
flannels that she had hung on a line in the kitchen. She occupied the front
room with her little Rlrl, and at 5 o'clock in the morning they were aroused
by some one knocking on the front door and shouting that the kitchen was
on fire.
Mrs. White took her daughter from the bed and placed her in safety
outside with a neighbor. Then she ran into the blinding smoke and tlame
and caught hold of her paralyzed brother and tried to drag him out of bed,
but he was too heavy and she could n<>t succeed in moving him. The unfor
tunate man was then unconscious, and Mrs. White, frantic with apprehen
sion, rushed out of the burning building for the purpose of calling for some
one to help her, but It was then too late. Several men who had been awak
ened by the outcry ran into the room and bore Berry's burning body away,
but he had beer, already roasted to death.
The fire was caused by a defective flue. Mrs. White usually burned wood
in her stove, and the coal fire overheated the stovepipe and set fire to the
shed roof. The jury returned a verdict of accidental death.
WHITTELL HAS
BEEN CHARGED
WITH FRAUD
His Sister-in-Law the
Complainant.
â¦
George Whittell now rests under the I
odium of a charge of fraud preferred yes
terday by his sister-in-law, Mrs. Ellen A.
Fife, wife of George S. Fife, in an action
filed in the Superior Court by which the
plaintiff seeks to recover judgment
â  against Whittell for the sum of Jiyo,3tj2,
' with interest from September 17, li>l>4. Mrs.
Kiio is a daughter, heir at law and dcvi
! see ot the late Nicholas Luning, who died
August 11, 1890, leaving an estate valued i
at about $10,000,000.
The will of the deceased, the complaint
alleges, was admitted to probate on Au- I
gust 29, 1890. and Whittell and Marion B.
Langhorne were appointed and Qualified j
as executors. Subsequently after all
devisees and bequests had been settled
and a residue of f?,2Gu,000 remained Whit-
I tell advised that the various heirs of the
i estate having an interest in the residue
! form a corporation to be known as the
"Liming Company," in order that great
j loss would not be sustained by the prema- i
! ture sale of the assets of the dead cap!- !
: lalist's estate. Having full confidence in
| the integrity of Whittell, Mrs. Fife's ;
' complaint continues, she agreed to the
: proposition, all interests in the residue ,
! were pooled, a corporation was formed
j and by order of court the interests of the
\ heirs were transferred to the corporation, '
j of which Marion B. Langhorne was ap
j pointed secretary.
In September of 1594 Mrs. Fife alleges
she was taken ill, and believing that she
was about to die applied to the corpora
tion for leave to sell her interest In the
corporation that she might make inde
pendent investments for the benefit of her ;
children. Upon the receipt of her appll- ;
I cation Mrs. Fife says that Whittell rep- '
j resented tn her that the value of her stock
j in the Luning Company was worth $700,
--000, and he agreed to purchase it for that
price and would in addition surrender a i
promissory note held by him against Mrs. j
Fife for the sum of 138,638. Believing that !
Whittell's statements were true and that
the sum named was a fair price for her ;
stock. Mrs. Fife accented the offer and '<
I the note was transferred to her, together !
; with four pieces of real estate alleged to '
be of the value of $700,000. Now Mrs. Fit>
1 says that the property transferred to her j
' Is not worth more than 1671,000 and that
her actual interest in the Luning Com
pany was worth fully $1,400,000, which :
fact, she claims, was kept from her
knowledge by the fraudulent representa
tions of Whittell. Tn consequence she â 
| asks for judgment in the sum named and |
costs of suit.
PHELAN'S LADDER.
Unlike That of Jacob It Was Fatal to
the Carpenter Who Trusted
His Weight Upon It.
Mayor Phelan appeared at the Coronpr's
office yesterday as a witness at the In
quest upon the body of John 11. Dunster,
the carpenter who was killed last Satur
day by falling from a rotten ladder on a
house at Thirteenth and Mission streets, i
The house belonged to the Phelan estate i
and it had bern reported to the Coroner !
that Agent McElroy and Mr. Phelan had
been notified of the dangerous character
of the ladder and had failed to put it In â 
order.
Mr. Phelan said that the property be- |
longed to the estate of the late James !
Phelan. his father, and that he was the
I executor. He had never been Informed that ,
I there was a ladder on the house, or that |
it was defective. R. D. McElroy. the i
agent in charge of the property, knew
more about it than he did.
Agent McElroy swore that he had never
been notified that the ladder was weak
or defective in any way. He had ordered
certain leaks in the roof to be stopped, and
presumed that the deceased had been sent j
by Robinson & Oillespte. the firm doing '
Mr. Phelan's work, to repair the leak.
Messrs. Robinson & Gillespie denied all ;
! knowledge as to the condition of the lad- !
der. They thought that Dunster must
have caught hold of the rung of the lad- !
der with both hands and leaned his whole j
weight upon it.
The jury returned a verdict of accidental
death.

Lizzie Downe, an unsophisticated Eng

Mormon cruelty and duplicity.
She was enticed from her home In Eng

Arthur Gardiner who promised that he
would give her a situation to do house
work in Salt Lake City at wages from
$8 to $10 per week. When he got the girl
in his clutches far away from her home
he tried to induce her to join the Mormon
church, and because she refused to obey
his bidding he deserted her and left her
to battle with starvation.
The young woman and her sister, Mrs.
Martha Paternoster, of 28 Marlow road,
Kensington, W., appealed to British

he was dragging it over her carpets she
: asked him to carry it, but he declined
j and when she tried to stop him he pushed
her aside. , , , ,
Frank testified that the trunk weighed
200 pounds. He could not carry it, so he
i dragged it over the carpet. Miss Horgan
1 planted herself in front of the trunk, and
' as he continued to shove it alone she
! iumned on top. He gently pushed her
from the top of the trunk and continued
j to Bhove it along till he got to the top of

The Judge thought that a charge of bat

ADVERTISEMENTS.
A TEST EXPERIMENT.
Peculiar Power Possessed by a New
Medicine.
| Of new discoveries there is no end. but
' one of the most recent, most remarkable
and one which will prove invaluable to
: thousands of people, is a discovery which
| it is believed will take the place of all
I other remedies for the cure of those com-
mon and obstinate diseases, dyspepsia
and stomach troubles. This discovery is
I not a loudly advertised, secret patent
, medicine, but is a scientific combination
j of wholesome, perfectly harmless vegeta-
i ble essences, fruit salts, pure pepsin and
! bismuth.
! These remedies are combined in lozenge
â  furm, pleasant to take, and will preserve
; their good qualities indefinitely, whereas
i all liquid medicines rapidly lose whatever
good qualities they may have had as soon
! as uncorked and exposed to the air.
! This preparation is called Stuart's Dys-
per.sia Tablets and it is claimed that one
| of these Tablets or lozenges will digest
from 300 to 3000 times its own weight of
meat, eggs and other wholesome food.
â  And this claim has been proven by actual
experiments in the following manner: A
hard boiled egg cut into small pieces was
1 placed in a bottle containing warm water
heated to ninety-eight degrees (or blood
heat). One of these Tablets was then
placed in the bottle and the proper tem-
perature maintained for three hours and
a half, at the end of which time the egg
was as completely digested as it would
have been in a healthy stomach This
experiment was undertaken to demon-
strait that what It would do in the bottle
it would also do in the stomach, hence
its unquestionable value in the cure of
dyspepsia and weak digestion. Very few
people are free from some form of indi-
gestion, but scarcely two will have the
same symptoms. Some will suffer most
from distress after eating, bloating from
gas in the stomach and bowels, others
have acid dyspepsia or heartburn., others
palpitation or headaches, sleeplessness,
! pains in chest and under shoulder blades,
i extreme rervonsness as in nervous dys-
! pepsia, but they all have same cause,
! failure to properly digest what is eaten.
The stomach must have rest and assist-
ance, and Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets give
it both by digesting the food for it and in
I a short time it is restored to its normal
i action and vigor. At same time the Tab-
j lets are so harmless that a child can take
i them with benefit. This new preparation
! has already made many astonishing
j cures, as, for instance, the following:
I After using only one package of Stuart's
j Dyspepsia Tablets I have received such
i great and unexpected benefit that I wish
;to express my sincere gratitude. In fact,
i it has been six months since I took the
i package and I hava not had one particle
lof distress or difficulty since. And all this
I In the face of the fact that the best doc-
i tors I consulted told me my case was
! Chronic Dyspepsia and absolutely incur-
â  able, as I had suffered twenty-live years.
; I distributed half a dozen packages
I among my friends here, who are very
. anxious to try this remedy.

FELL INTO THE HOLD
AND BROKE HIS SKULL
OAKLAND, Oct. 31.â Captain S. Low
berg, aged 50 years, fell through a hatch
way and down into the hold of the con
demned ship Professor Moss, lying off
Hay & "Wright's shipyard, to-night, and
sustained a iraeture of the skull that will
probably prove fatal. Lowberg was for
merly captain of the Moss, which was
condemned as unseaworthy about a year
ago. after battling several storms at sea.
She is now being dismantled.
Captain Lowberg has a wife and several
children residing in New York State. The
physicians at the Receiving Hospital ex
press very slight hnprs of his recovery.
HITE CASE.
Judge Paterson Completes His Long
Argument.
Judge Van R. Paterson finished his ar
gument in the Hite case yesterday after
noon after speaking for two days on the
plaintiff's side. His argument was con
fined to the legal issues of the suit and
many cases were read in full. It was
thought that Judge Paterson would end
his argument by noon, but by courtesy
he was allowed the afternoon in which to
complete his case. All of the argument
yesterday was confined to the citation of
rases dependent upon purely legal issue 3.
W W. Foote will begin his argument
this morning and many sensational fea
tures are promised.
Guy Chick's Successor.
BERKELEY, Oct. 31.â Superintendent

Maloney. In consequence of an appoint
ment in the engineering department of
one of the big Eastern railways Mr.
Chick recently tendered his resignation

La Estrella's Festival.
Prior to last night La Estrella Parlor
of the Native Daughters of the Golden
"West had been rather quiet in the line
of entertainments and it was thought
that the members were no longer in the
field of social functions, but the Hallow
een party last evening, in the banquet
hall of the Native Sons' building, gave
proof that the merry young ladies of that
parlor are still strictly in it. The hall
was decorated with the time-honored
pumpkin lanterns, and there were apples
suspended from the chandeliers. The
many who filled the hall were entertain
ed with a short programme that had for
features a song and dance by Melville
Coakley; Cakewalk by Juliette Turpin
and William Martin, and vocal solos by
Jack Robinson and Mrs. Keys. Then fol
lowed a pie-eating contest, ducking for
apples, the game of the loggies and other
games Incident to the festival, all of
which were productive of enjoyment.
The affair was a great success in every
sense and after the games there was
dancing. Miss E. Mclnnery. Mr?. M.
Katz, Mrs. J. Seward, Miss Minnie
Klevesahl. Mis? M. Hansen, Miss J.
Vasselin and Miss G. Behlow were the
committee on entertainment.

THE SEATING OF QURY.
THE announcement' is made, with every appear- |
ance of authority, that a poll of the Senate
shows that Senator Quay will be seated on the
appointment of Governor Stone. A new element has
appeared which perhaps has aided toward the result,
i: the report of the poll be true. Utah failed to elect
a Senator. It is said that Governor Wells, elected as
a Republican, but a Mormon, is pledged to appoint
ex Senator Frank Cannon to succeed himself, and
that Cannon has brought a number of Silver Demo
crats with whom he acts in the Senate to the support
of Quay in exchange for Republican votes to seat
Cannon.
Four States failed to elect Senators, their Legisla
tures adjourning after long and futile balloting.
These are Pennsylvania, Delaware, Utah and Califor
nia. Governor Tunnell of Delaware is a Democrat,
and if Stone's and Well?' appointees are seated he
will doubtless appoint a Silver Democrat. If an ap
pointee from California appear the net result of
changing the old policy of the Senate as to executive
appointments will be the seating of two free silver
Senators and two Republicans, bo that as to the great
iesuc which secured a Republican majority in 1896
there will be a stand-off.
But there is a view of the matter that goes farther.
Six Northern Republican Senators are from States
with Silver Democratic or Populist Governors. Some
one has said that the statesman who leaves death and
physical disability out of his calculations for the fu
ture omits one of the most certain factors. With the
rule established that Governors always have jurisdic
tion over a vacancy some quite interesting results
might appear.
But. aside from merely interesting speculations, if
the Senate change its precedents and policy in respect
to executive jurisdiction in filling its seats further
changes of great moment may be expected to follow,
which will go through our whole system of govern
ment. When that body settles the issue in favor of
continuance of jurisdiction in the Governor after the
Legislature fails to elect great momentum v.ill be
given to the policy of taking the election of Senators
away from both Legislature and Governor and giv
ing it directly to the people. Then, when a vacancy
occurs by resignation, death or otherwise, in the lan
guage of the constitution, the Governor will of neces
sity have extended to him the power to call a special
election for Senator, as he does now for Representa
tive when such vacancy occurs in that office.
The advocates of the seating of Quay, which will
permit an appointed Senator from California, Utah
and Delaware to pass in by the same door, hold, with
Senator Hoar, that every State is entitled to have its
two Senators always in commission.
We regard this as an erroneous view, with all due
respect to the distinguished gentleman who origin
ated it. It is based upon that clause of the consti
tution which says that no State shall be deprived of
its equal suffrage in the Senate without its consent.
We have never seen any difficulty in the construc
tion of that clause. The Legislature is the electoral
body representing the State in the choice of a Sena
tor. When that electoral body chooses not to elect a
Senator that is the consent of the State to temporary
deprivation of its equal suffrage in the Senate. There
has been no compulsion in the matter. The State-;
consent must be expressed through its official per
sonality. The people as a whole cannot express
themselves otherwise. If the calculations which jus
tify the prediction that Quay will be seated are cor
rect the matter amounts to a decision of all three
political parties in the Senate to change an interpre
tation of the constitution. Senators Hanna, Jones
and Butler, chairmen respectively of the National
Committees of the Republican, Democratic and
Populist parties, arc known to stand together in the
matter in favor of the change.
The Cnll need only Bay that it stands where it did
in the former di -*f this matter, in lint* with
â  jurisdiction to appoint depart^ from
the Governor when the Legislature meets and does
by the failure of that body to elect.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 1. 1899.
GOING INTO DEBT.
IT is an old stying, and true, that Governments and
bts in good times to be paid
in bad times.
San Francisco may not be able to boast of much
in the way of municipal improvements, but she can
SI entire freedom from municipal debt.
With this immunity from the burden of debt, how
! ever, die has also the finest public park in. the world,
and her far-stretched streets are bordered by as fine
-, ...... â¢ , t as any city can boast.
No one objects to a reasonable expenditure for
â¢ r public improvements, nor to a reasonable bond
i SSUC â¢ â¢ the peculiar campaign made by
Phelan seems to ambush a sumptuous and
- programme and gay carnival to be enjoyed
on the proceeds of a mortgage to be put upon the
the amount of many millions. The volume
lebt suggested runs from a minimum of say five
millions to a maximum of twenty-five millions, and if
the project be entered upon it is more likeiy to be the
greater than the less amount. If that be its volume,
it will be seen that the interest to be paid annually
is a sum so large that if it were devoted directly to
needed public improvements, without issuing bonds
at all, it would, if levied -annually during the same
period as the life of a bond issue, produce more
money for public use than the original principal of
the bond issue itself. While we are not opposing any
ready means that will effect such improvements as are
needed, we desire to call attention to the most
economical method of effecting them.
The Democratic programme is singular in that* it
defeats one of the purposes to which it gives first
Mr. Phelan advocates public ownership of
r r.blic utilities, which are gas and water works and i
street railroads. To buy these public utilities, which
are already in existence and belong to their stock- j
lers, or to create their equals in capacity to serve !
the public in their several ways, will require an out
many millions of d>
If this outlay Le added to an existing bonded debt
id for the purpose of public improve
ments, which under existing law must be made by the
city, there will appear a bonded debt on San Fran
cisco sufficient t<. satisfy the most extensive fancy.
We are of the opinion that the people will require %
a trial of the experiment of public ownership of many
ar public utilities. Public opinion runs that way
and has much argument to sustain it. But when that
policy iÂ« installed there will occur two things. These
public utilities as they now exi-t are contributing tax
payers. Then they will cease to contribute, except j
through their revenue ;.s business plants. If the Â«cale
of rates upon which they are ran is set at the point
of profit to the city, the surplus they will yield will
to the public treasury. But it is hardly to be ex
â l that thi> scale can be sue! -to fully recoup
the treasury after paying interest r.pon the investment.
Their operation by the city government will be of
course political, and our dollar limit experience shows
that party platforms will leapfrog each other in prom
;-ing to the voi cr rates for water and gas and
tear fares. Whatever deficit is left, between tho
these utilities and the present taxe= de
rived from th- course be made up by taxa
tion of private property.
So when imj â¢- and public ownership of
public utilities are discussed it all comes back to the
â  taxation. Just how far can a city go in con
tracting debt before the benefit derived from the pro
ceeds of bond* is nullified by the rate of taxation is
a question always of vital interest and needful of cool
deliberation.
Politicians who are candidates for office get heated
in the running and frequently over-promise beyond
the capacity of the city to perform and protect its in
terests One thing is -'.ire. The experiment of pub
lic ownership of public utilities will be tried fn San
Frann~~<*. and it will be tried under circumstances un
favorable to its uccess if it have to be added to an
existing load of large bonded indebtedness. There
fore proposed policies should not be permitted to
neutralize each other, nor should the mere tricks and
tactics of politicians be permitted to confuse the pub
lic mind ?.Â« to the straight way to all that is required
by the public interests.
The Boers have offered 300 acres of fertile land for
the head of Cecil Rhodes, dead or alive. This is
perhaps the highest price ever offered for a deadhead.
WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY.
OUR contemporaries, which for reason? satis
factory to themselves ignored the feats of
wireless telegraphy accomplished first by The
Call in obtaining a report of the arrival of the trans
port Sherman off the Golden (rate, and later by The
Call and the New York Herald in reporting the inci
dents of the yacht races are going to have some diffi
culty in catching up with the news of the day, for
wireleÂ«< telegraphy, either in its achievements or by
experiments to be made with it, is to furnish some of
the mn-t important news items of the time.
Dispatches from New York announce that naval
officials are taking great interest in the tests with the
new system of telegraphy which are being made
under the direction of Marconi. The tests will be
continued for some time, so that the system can be
tried in all sorts of weather and under all sorts of
conditions. It is also announced from London that
the British are to make use of wireless telegraphy in
the South African war and have already made prep
arations for putting it into service.
The experiments by our Government and the tests
made in actual war will give to wireless telegraphy
a prestige which even yellow journalism can no
longer afford to ignore. It will he in vain such jour
nal* resort to fakes to match the accomplishments of
science and invention. The marvels of truth cannot
long be suppressed even by the falsest of journalists,
and ere long the very pnpcrs that mocked 1 at the new
triumph of human ingenuity will be giving up whole
pages to exploiting i's achievements. It is to be
note'! that the Kxamincr recently admitted to its
columns a dispatch from New York giving an, ac
count of the te?tÂ« made by the Navy Department, and
saying: "While the board has set the seal of official
secrecy on it? verdict, there is no denying the fact
that wirelrÂ«s telegraphy is an ftnqualified success."
The new system of telegraphy, moreover, is to
serve other than war purposes. It is not in war
offices only that its possibilities are being studied.
At the present time two important projects basel
upon wireless telegraphy are under consideration by
men of means and enterprise. One of these is a plan
to arrange for communication among the islands of
the West Indies by the system, and the other, more
far-reaching still, is a scheme for opening communi
cation along the coast of Labrador.
The latter enterprise is one of more than ordinary
interest. Every year a fleet of sloops and smail
steamers from Newfoundland go to the coast of Lab
rador, where they engage in fishing. It is said that
some 12.000 fishermen of Newfoundland embark
every year in the venture, and there has long been
a demand for some means of communication be
tween them during the fishing season, which lasts
from early in June until late in October. So large
arc the property interests involved that a land line
would have been established up and down the coast
had it not been for the difficulty of preserving such
a line from destruction during the winter.
Wireless telegraphy offers a solution of the
problem. By means of it communication can be es
tr.blished along the coast and notice can be thus given
where the best fishing is to be found at any particular
season and also where shipwrecks occur and men arc
in need of assistance. At the invitation of the New
foundland Government Marconi's principal assistant
has undertaken to study the problem, and ere long
preparations may be begun to put it into effect next
summer.
These are issues of the day, and sooner or later
every newspaper in tke country will have to give
some space to them. Wireless telegraphy can no
longer be ignored.
HOT ABOUT WATER.
WE are still surprised by the heat shown by the
National Irrigators against the coming water
storage convention.
A snowstorm of tracts, letters, papers, periodicals
and pamphlets is falling all over the State, in which
the supposed projectors of the convention are de
nounced as lawyers and other things, to be regarded
with suspicion.
These letters advise the people that national irri
gation means irrigation without debt, for its plan is:
"Federal reservoirs for the storage of flood waters,
to be built through appropriations under the river
and harbor bill, as recommended in the Chittenden
report." We are not favored with a copy of the Chit
tenden report, but we favor it. The convention will
favor it. If something can be had for nothing, Cali
fornia will be the last State to refuse it. But while
the promoters of the convention feel that spirit toward
the national irrigators, the latter are making the wel
kin howl with attacks on the convention. They have
issued a circular which reads like a penny dreadful
and is as lurid as one of Cobbett's lampoons, in which
they say to those who receive it by mail: "Will you
not secure the necessary appointment (as delegate to
the convention) immediately, so that you may attend
this convention, and write informing me whether you
can do so, and whether we may have your support
and co-operation in the national movement? Should
you be willing to attend the convention, and not be
able to secure an appointment under the call, please
advise immediately and some arrangement may be
possible which will secure for you the desired right
to attend as a delegate."'
This is a cold-blooded proposition to pack the con
vention with the inflexible adherents of the national
plan. Its impropriety will be seen when it is known
that the convention is called not to antagonize that
plan nor to indorse it. but to consult upon a subject
of vast interest to California, leave open the right of
way to all plans and see whether the day of storage
of waste water cannot be hastened by some other than
the modes that have been a long time in action with
out catching any water.
We desire to c ay that a packed convention, in the
interest of Federal appropriations, will harm only the
mtere-t that is spending rhetoric, denunciation and
Cash to secure it.
The National Irrigators seem to be full jeweled.
They maintain offices in Chicago, Washington, St.
Louis, San Francisco and Los AngeleÂ«. They have
| a treasury that supports a costly propaganda. All
this honey may come out of the flowers which are to
bloom on the nationally irrigated lands in the future,
â¢ its lavish u<e now suggests inquiry as Â»to its
source.
Mr. Phelan's attempts to induce Republicans to
vote crooked while the Democrats vote straight has
j had no effect thus far except to make himself crooked
BRITISH WAR REPORTS.
SHORTLY after the publication yi official dis
patches announcing the success of the British
forces at Glencoe, near Dundee, there came
from Pretoria a report giving the Boer version of
the affair. The Pretoria account of the results of the
battle were widely different from that sent out by the
British, and The Call in commenting upon the dis
crepancy stated that the events to follow in the next
few days would show which report was the more
accurate. There is now no longer any doubt on the
question. The Boers were not defeated at Glencoe.
Their advance has been continuously forward, and
the British, despite their claims of victory, have had
to fall back from every one of their advanced posi
tions.
Notwithstanding the retreat of his army, notwith
standing the imminent danger of complete defeat
which threatens it at Ladysmith, General White con
tinues to send boastful dispatches to London an
nouncing victorious attacks on the Boer lines. These
dispatches are doubtless designed to be reassuring,
but they have ceased to have that effect. Reports
from London show that the people are in a high state
of anxiety concerning the situation, and compara
tively little trust is put in the official assurances that
all is well.
The unreliable nature of the official reports given
to the public was exposed in Parliament during the
short session called to vote money for the war. On
the floor of the Commons it was openly charged that
the Secretary of State for the Colonies was suppress
ing or misrepresenting dispatches from the front.
The charges were indignantly repudiated, but the re
pudiation only shifts the responsibility a little further
back. Clearly the truth has not been told, and if the
Ministers in London have not altered the dispatches
thru the general at the front has misrepresented the
facts.
Judged by the results, Weyler's dispatches of vic
tories over the Cubans were not more false and mis
leading than those which the British authorities in
South Africa have sent out concerning the battles of
the present war. They have claimed successes in every
engagement, have repeatedly asserted that the Boers
were driven back from point after point with heavy
loss, and yet the movements of the campaign show
that it is the British who have hnd to retreat, the Brit
ish whose losses in killed, wounded and prisoners
have constituted the serious features of the fighting,
and the British who are now in peril of being forced
to surrender their army to save it from annihilation.
Over and over again British critics have denounced
the censored reports sent out from Manila under the
orders of General Otis. Over and over again they
have assumed a superior virtue in lecturing the Amer
ican people upon the misrepresentation of news.
Never, however. ha<= there ever been committed by
the officials of this country, whether civil or military,
any such wholesale and extraordinary misrepresenta
tion as that which is now being carried on by the
British general in his reports from the seat of
war. It is not surprising to learn that even his own
countrymen do not believe him, and, despite the best
efforts of the Government to reassure them, the feel
ing in London continues to be one of intense
anxiety.

PROPOSITIONS ON THE SCHEME
OF NATIONAL IRRIGATION
W. S. Green Says the Plan of Raising a Fund by Renting Our Arid
Lands for Ten Cents an Acre Is All Humbug.
Editor Call: I have been criticized for ;
saying that the National Irrigation Con- [
gre*s was a magnificent humbug, and one '
paper says that it whs this congress that j
brought out the point "That if all our i
arid lands were rented or leased for a !
terna of years at 10 cents per acre, i
this amount would create a fund thai
if applied to the purpose of building â 
reservoirs, would build all that was re- |
quired," etc. This congress, through its
authorized spokesmen, announced an in- j
come of $500,000 from these 10-cent lands, i
Now I udd "magnificent humbug," and
If I do not prove it take my head for a
football. Let us first see about this 10
--cent business. This congress presumes to
be a teaching body, and should be toler
ably correct in Its statements and calcu
lations. Who is to rent this land at 10
cents an acre, which superficially looks
cheap?
Land is worth in Europe Its rental value
for from thirty-five to forty years; In the
| Eastern States the value is placed at its
I rents for about thirty years, and in Call
i fornia it Is certainly worth its rental
\ value for twenty years. Ten cents an acre
| for twenty years is $2. Now, money on
: long loans can be had at 5 per cent por
annum, but who would take the chances
; on any kind of a loan if he could pur
chase land at $2 an acre rented out at 10
! centP, or for a rental that would pay for it
in twenty years, getting his income every
I rear? This is, of course, unimproved
! land with no expenses whatever on It.
jTo assume, therefore, that we have
five millions of acres that will rent right
; away for 10 cents an acre, we must as
| sume that the land is worth as it Is, wlth
i out any speculative future, $2 an acre
I Is there 2(5,000 acres of land in all Call-
I fornia except timber lands, not in private
hands worth $2 an acre? I think not.
There is certainly not five millions.
But we will all admit that land is worth
: what it will rent for In ten years, for
this Is 10 per cent Interest.
Xow, a fair sample of the lands that
1 would be for rent is the unentered lands
: on the line of the Southern Pacific, be
i tween Bakersfield, and say. Saugus
' Every little water place Is of course- in
! private hands. Now, if you had "money
: to burn" would you give $1 an acre for
I all the Government land in sight of the
i road? You are to take it. De it remem
bered, without any speculative value, but
! you are to make your money back In rent-
Ing it or using it in its present 'ondltlon
I Do you think there is a single quarter
! section for which you would give 5160
! cash under such conditions? If you were
going into the sheep business would \nu
; take all the unentered !hu<l for ten miles
each side of the road, between Lancaster
and Saugus, for nothing? If you did you
â  could easily be sent to the lunatic asylum'
| Yet that, nnd millions of other such ac.-es
I would have to come in on the l',-cent
proposition.
Then to pet their $500,000 a year they
must find D.n00.000 acres or 7Sil square
: miles worth $2 an acre without the
; privilege of taking off any timber! A
< great teaching body, that is going to en-
I lighten all the United States, is barred
out from pleading the baby act by savinr
I It was a guess.
Apropos of estimating the value of
i grazing land, I know of some parties who
thought it a good speculation to locate
some "lieu" on some grazing land toler
ably high up in the mountains. The land
is well watered and will grow potatoes" In
great abundance and all other things
that will mature at an altitude
of 5009 feet. They located it and
paid the State fees, but could not
make the first payment, so it is State
land. Knowing of this 1 gave a rich
stockman of the same county a map of
it and told him he could get it for $1 23
an acre. He examined it and said it
would not pay. Now one acre of this land
is worth a whole section of some of the
land one can see from the car window
between Lancaster and Saugus, and yet
if it can be rented for 10 cents an acre
the StatÂ»> would not keep it long.
The wild ranges of California are used
up to their utmost now, and yet little
valleys and watering places in the moun
tains that have commanded range have
not sold for much more than $2 an acre
We must count on sheep from which to
pet our revenueâ our $500,000. Suppose we
assume that one-third of our three mil
lion sheep arc fed on Government land?
We would have to get :>0 cents a head out
of them for the use of the land!
Now I admit that riuite a revenue might
be had from leasing the Government
lands, but these people have told us 10
cents an acre and $500,000 as the result,
and they must not be permitted to plead
th* baby actâ they are great teachers.
If the lands should be rented to the best
advantage it would be to large syndi
cates, who would crowd out smaller
growers, and this would be an evil; an
evil bo great as to make it a debatable
question as to its policy on that ground
alone. If the Government should enter
on a scheme of land leasing it would have
to make different prices on the land, be
cause there is a vast difference in it and
this would give rise to fraud and favorit
ism. Then to mako it all one priceâ lo
centsâ everybody would have to be kept
off Government land who would not pay
that price, because if not nobody would
rent, and then all land not worth $2 an
acre would not be used, and that would
be to the detriment of the State and its
people.
Then the authorized spokesmen of the
congress tell us that they are going to
build reservoirs in the mountains and
t)<en have no system of distribution other
thin voluntary co-operative companies'
That is a thousand fold worse than that
10-ront humbug. They are going to build
reservoirs up on the headwaters of such
a river as the Kings, with say 200 square
miles to be served, and let a lot of little
voluntary co-operative companies go after
it as best they may! No law to protect
the rights of those too weak to protect
their own, no laws to make those pay who
ought to pay! The congress, or the prin
cipal part of it, made money fighting the
district plan of distribution, and it all the
time announced that that work must go
to the wall in order that the fee may be
earned. If it is provided that all must
pay who get benefits and all in the range
of benefit shall have a right it comes to
the basis of the district system, and the
fee pr id the congress would not be
earned! Alongside this sort of humbug
gerv the 10-cent price falls into utter
nothingness.
It is said that there were a whole lot
of good men in that convention. Of course
there were, but take the proceedings and
| see that a very few run it. We have all
! been in conventions of the sort. A few
i prepare a programme and all the rest
think they know what they are about and
the programme goes. For example, In all
this talk about this 10-cent rent *ho has
taken the trouble to analyze it and even
think to himself what a magnificent hum-
other points yet that ought
to be showed up. but I have exhausted
your patience. Â«â¢ S. Ohbt^.

"YELLOW JACK"
MAY BE ABOARD
THE ST, ENOCH
Is Now Long Overdue
From Panama.
â â¢ â
The British ship St. Enoch Is now out
112 days from Panama. She is coming
here for orders, but when she. will arrive
off the heads is problematical and the
underwriters are paying 5 per cent to re
insure the risks they have taken on the
vessel. Yellow fever seems to be more
feared in this Instance than storms and a
rock-bound coast. Shipping men are
afraid that the dread scourge has broken
out among the ship's crew and* that she
may be drifting around helpless In Cen
tral American waters.
In July last the British ships St. Enoch
ami Edenballyraore and the QerniUi snip
Coriolanus were all in Panama. Early in
September the Panama steamers brought
the news that yellow jack was prevalent
on the isthmus and that some of the ships
named i.ad lost near.ly.all their crews.
The St. Enoch got away on July 18 and
has only been spoken once since. Then
she was still in the Gulf of Panama and
had made very little progress toward San
Francisco. The Coriolanus lost fifteen of
her crew from yellow jack, but secured
men to take their places, and on August
15 she made a start for Victoria, B. C.
Soon after getting away from the Isthmus
the fever broke out aboard the ship and
when five of the crew died the captain
, decided to put back.
On August 25 the Coriolanus reached
Panama and was placed in quarantine.
On the Edenballymore the fever had
claimed the captain's wife as a victim
and many of the crew had died. When
the City of Panama left Panama the
Edenballymore was still In port. After
being released from quarantine the Corio
lanus made another start for Victoria and
reached there last Monday. When her
story was made public the underwriters
immediately began figuring on the chances
of the St. Enoch, and the probabilities
are that the reinsurance on hor will take
a lump during the next few days.
The British ship Scottish Hills, now at
Calcutta from Port Blakeley, had two nar
row escapes during the voyage. She left
Puget Sound lumber laden on April 23 last
and seven days later encountered a storm
that started a number of the stanchions
and caused the vesel to labor so heavily
that Captain Blackmore, in order to save
his ship, jettisoned the deckload. After
that all went well for a time, and then
a tornado was encountered that blew the
sails out of the bolt ropes and threw the
ship on her beam ends. She sprang a
leak, but luckily it was not a very serious
one, and port was made without any fur
ther mishap.
David Walk, a carpenter, made a des
perate attempt upon his life in the saloon
on the corner of Howard and Main streets
yesterday. With a penknife he cut his
wrists and both sides . of his neck and
stabbed himself twice over the heart. At
the Harbor Hospital Drs. Morrison and
Dorr attended to him and as none of the
wounds are serious he will probably re
cover. Henry Steffens, barkeeper in the
saloon, says that Walk was on the verge
of delirium tremens when he attempted
to kill himself. He thought people wero
chasing him to take his life and armed
himself with a pistol, which Steffens took
away from him. While the barkeeper
was out of the room for a few minutes
Walk started hacking himself and when
Stcffons came back the carpenter was
trying to hammer the knife into his heart
with his right hand, while he held the
blade in position with his left. Walk had
j secured a Job at Livermore and was to
; have left for that place yesterday.
The steamers Curacoa and Flintshire
made port yesterday. The Curacoa came
from Mexican ports and brought up con
| siderable ore and treasure, but vorv few
i passengers. The Flintshire is from Yoko
| naraa in ballast. She is to carry wheat
from here to Europe for G. W. Mr-Near
The Government was negotiating for her
j with the intention of using her as a trans
i port, but as quite a number of vessels are
i due from Manila and . several are now
; nearly ready for troops, the chances nre
I the Flintshire will not be chartered The
big tramp was here about three years ajro
and took a cargo of general merchandise
to London.
The German gunboat Geier went out for
a run around the Farallones yesterday
and came back to her anchorage during
. the afternoon. A new chief has taken
j charge of the. engine-room, and it was to I
; give him a chance to inspect the working
i of the machinery that the trip was made i
Captain Alex Swanson, the pilot, took '
I the Geier to sea and back again. t

MEN TO WATCH
THE FIGHT IN
THE TRANSVAAL
Four Officers Ordered
to Africa.
The Forty-fourth Infantry has arrived i
from Fort Leavenworth, Kan, Two bat- â¢
talions came in Monday night and '
marched to the Presidio yesterday morn- â 
Ing. They were the First Battalion, under !
command of Major H. C. Hale, and the
Third Battalion, under Major 11. B. Mc-
Coy. Major McCoy will be well remem
bered here as the colonel of the Colorado
regiment that was mustered out at the
Presidio last September. His appoint
ment as a major In one of the new regi
ments fs in recognition of his efficient ser
vice with the volunteers of his State. The
Forty-fourth Rtgiment is quartered in the
old camp of the Colorado men, just inside
the east gate of the post.
Recent orders from Washington show
that this Government is not letting any
military opportunity slip through its
fingers. By the orders four officers of the
army were detailed to accompany the
British troops in the Transvaal to inspect
the maneuvers and report upon them. The
Government was notified, however, that
four officers were too many, for if that
number came from each power there
would be trouble accommodating them
all, and it was requested that not so
many be sent, co some of the lucky ones
will have to stay at home; which ones
will stay is so far not known. The offi
cers detailed in the order are Colonel
Samuel S. Sunnier, Sixth Cavalry; Major
John P. Story, Seventh Artillery; Cap
tain William W. Gibson, Ordnance De
partment, U. S. A., and Captain Stephen
I'll. Slocum, Eighth Cavalry. The in
fantry is not represented, but it is prob- :
ably because the infantry has just now i
all it can do in the I'hilippines and in
Cuba and Porto Rico.
Captain J. D. Leitch, Twenty-fifth in
fantry, recently ordered to join his com
mand at Fort Houston, Texas, has been
appointed to the examining board to meet
at that post.
An examining board to meet at the Pre
sidio and examine officers for promotion
has been appointed with the following
membership: Lieutenant Colonel Wallace
Randolph, Third Artillery; Lieutenant
Colonel Marion P. Maus, inspector general
of volunteers; Major Robert Gibson, sur- j
geon; Captain Sedgwiek Pratt, Third Ar
tillery; Captain James M. Kennedy, as
sistant surgeon, and First Lieutenant
Rogers F. Garden.-r. Third Artillery, re
corder. The ofiii ors ordered to appear be
fore it are Second Lieutenant Alvln R.
Ileiberg, Sixtli Cavalry; Second Lieuten
ant Ethelbert L. D. Br'eckinridge, Seventh
Infantry; Second Lieutenant Theodore A.
Baldwin. Twenty-fourth Infantry, and
First Lieutenant John H. Wholley,
Twenty-fourth Infantry.
Lieutenant Wholley is just now the
colonel of the First Washington Volun
teers, to be mustered out to-day. But
he has even more luck than being pro
moted to a captaincy in the fegular army
â he has been notilied that he has been
appointed a major in one of the new
regiments to leave soon for the Philip
pines by way of the Suez canal, and as
soon as his regiment has been mustered i
out he will join his new command. It is
probable that he will be examined for his
promotion In the regular service before
he goes Bast. He announced the fact to
the regiment yesterday, and the an
nouncement was received with cheers as
well as regrets that he could not be in at
the reception awaiting the returning
troops.
It has not even yet been settled how
â¢he Washington men are going home.
They will be mustered out to-day, and if
the old programme be adhered to five
companies will go home by way of the
ocean and the remaining seven by rail.
yesterday a telegram was sent to the
reception committee asking if it could
not secure transportation by rail for the
five amphibious! organizations, bui
answer was received. It will come In
time, however, the men feel assured.
A bell captured by the Washington
regiment and afterward used as a call
bell by Colonel Wholiey has been pre
sented' to Whitman College by those of
the Washington regiment who have grad
uated from that institution. It is suit
ably inscribed with the names of the men
who attended the college and afterward
joined the regiment, and it sneaks well
for the. regiment that nearly twenty
names were on the list. Whitman Col
lege is at Walla Walla. The two cannon
captured ny Company H of the Washing
tons have been given into the custody or
the captors by Colonel Wholley. Prop
erly speaking they belong to the regi
ment, but Company H was alone in their
capture and the colonel yields the spoils

SAN FRANCISCO. Cal.. Oct. 30, 1889.
Editor Call: In your Issue of this morning
nnpenrs a communication from Captain F. W.
Hunt formerly of the First Idaho volunteers.
In which that gentleman takes occasion to Call
me to task for some statement alleged to have
been marie by me respecting the Thirteenth
United States Infantry. I wish to say once
for all that no such statement as that credited
to me was ever made by me at any time, nor
at any place, nor under any circumstances.
Such being the case no comment Is necessary
on my part. The. alleged statement was Riven
birth by a newspaper reporter endowed with a
vivid imagination, and who at the time was
laboring under the hallucination that he was
e'oinir to create a sensation. Respectfully yours,
B B .1 .T. WEIBENBURGER,
â¢ Major First Washington Infantry, U. S. V.
SHE CAME FROM MARTINEZ.
A woman about 40 years of ape, who
gave the name of Mrs. Maud Clark of
Martinez, a school teacher, and said she
was stopping at the Grand Hotel, created
! a sensation in the neighborhood of the
City Hall yesterday afternoon by quar
; reling with E. M. Carlston. a hack driver.
They were taken to police headquarters,
â  where Carlston alleged that the woman
had been driving In his hack all day
! and refused to pay the proper fee. He
was told to leave the woman alone and
she left on that understanding.
Carlston did not keep" his promise, and
when the woman jumped on a Larkin
street car he drove after the car in his
hack and kept shouting at her that ho
wanted his money. She got off the car,
and Detective Dillon and Policeman Pyle
' arrested Carlston and he and the woman
i were again taken to police headquarters.
' She claimed that she bad been robbed of
; $190 and a gold watch, but declined to
i charge the hackman with the robbery,
i and he was booked at the City Prison on
; a charge of disturbing the peace.
I Carlston said that the woman called for
i a hack at the T, in-line Baths yesterday
i morning and he responded. He drove her
all over the city and to the Presidio,
where she met some soldiers and spent a
â  lot of money In buying drink for them.
i She visited a number of saloons during
the day and finished up In Mike Smith's
I saloon on Larkin street, opposite the City
I Hall. Tf she lost her watch and money
i it must have been in some of the saloons,
i ns he knew nothing about it.
Police as Patrol Drivers.
Since the resolution dismissing- * patrol
wagon drivers and substituting members
of the police force in their stead was
parsed by the Board of Supervisors, a
[lumber ..f applications have 'been handed
to the Police Commissioners for the occu
pancy of the vacancies. The positions at
the California-street station have bten
filled by Officers James Connolly and
James McGovern. Both were appointed
on their merits. having been long In the
service and each bearing an enviable
record. The old drivers weÂ« dropped
from the payroll yesterday, and their suc
cessors handled the ribbons for the first
time last night. -

I. NEW WORDS AND HOW TO
USE THEM.
(Concluded.)
Most people fail In expression rather
than in thought. We have too few words
â  which are really our own. It should not
I be a difficult matter to add at least one
j new word a day. The new words se-
I lected for thf>se studies are simply sug
j gestive of what students can do for them
i selves. The list cannot be continued be
yond to-day's lesson. When In your read- |
ing- or conversation you meet a "choice" \
word which you have never owned get I
possession of it and use it as your own
property. Note the following:
Debonair â Pronounced "deb-o-nare,"
with the accent upon the last syllable.
A person who Is courteous, affable, well
bred In manner ami bearing is properly
described as debonair.
I Chefâ Pronounced "shef." A male head
cook; applied especially to a French cook.
The chief cook In the larger and more
expensive American hotels Is commonly
called the chef.
Grotesque â Pronounced "grow-tesk." A
thing is grotesque If in form or outline
It is ill-proportioned, fantastic, uncouth.
This word is applied to anything of odd
or extravagant shape or character. A
circus clown is grotesque In his make-up.
Entreeâ Pronounced "ahng-tray," with
the last syllable accepted. An entree Is
a subordinate dish brought In between
courses or along with or before a prin
cipal dish at dinner. The name is com
monly used on bills of fare to represent
I side dishes.
Repartee â Pronounced "rep-ar-tee,"
with the last syllable accented. A per
son is said to be good at repartee when
ready, witty or apt In reply; when ques
tions or accusations are met by quick,
' sharp rejoinders.
Piqueâ Pronounced "peek." A feeling
'< of slight or irritation usually caused by
| envy or wounded pride. We may say that I
a person is piqued when his self-love or
vanity is wounded.
Cultureâ A people are cultured who are
educated and refined, as shown In their
habits, inclinations, purposes, conversa
tion and aspirations. A man of culture
is not only a well-read man, but one
whoso knowledge has broadened and
strengthened his view of life; he Is gen
erous In spirit and large of heart.
Estheticâ Pertaining to the science of
taste or beauty. An esthete loves the
! beautiful or artistic. The name Is some
i times applied In a cynical way to desig
nate pretended artistic taste.
Neeâ Pronounced "nay."' The literal
meaning is "born." This word is some
times placed before a married woman's |
maiden name to indicate the family to !
j which she belongs. Mrs. Jones, nee >
j Jackson, would indicate that Mrs. Jones' j
i family name before marriage was Jack- i
son.
Protege â Pronounced "pro-tay-szha,"
with the accent on the first syllable. It
means one who is under the care or pro
tection of another. If Mr. Brown is

tion or a salaried position. Miss Smith i
is said to be a protege of Mr. Brown.
Sedentary â Pronounced "sed-â¬n-tary," !
with the accent upon the first syllable.
A man whose work confines him" to his
desk or keeps him sitting a great deal is
said to be of sedentary habits.
Fastidiousâ People are said to be fas
tidious if they are hard to please or easily ;
repelled. The word means nearly the
same as particular or overnice.
Volatileâ Pronounced "vol-a-till," -with i
the first syllable accented. This -word
means "evaporating rapidly," and is prop
erly applied to that which is changeable

I. ARITHMETIC OF THE WORK- i
SHOP.
I/esson No. 3.
The young mechanic may find it conven
ient to be able to measure triangular sur
faces. In the illustration here given the
triangle BCD (shaped portion) ia one-half
of the rectangular figure ABCD, and the
triangle KGM is one-half the rectangular
figure EFGH. Then, to find the area of a
triangle we multiply the base of the per
pendicular height and take half the pro
duct. In the atfst figure the base is CD
and the perpendicular height DB; in the
second figure the base is GH and the per-
pendicular hettrht is EG or KM or FH
There is a proposition is geometry which
pays that "triangles upon the same
and between the same parallels are
equal.' In the illustration the triangles
ARC and DBO are equal; all triangles
having BC for a base and of the same
perpendicular height are equal. For in-
Btance, the triangle EBC is of the same
area as ABC or DBC. Each triangle is
one-half the area of the rectangle. Note
the following exercises:
1. Find the area In square inches of a
triangle the base of which is 1 foot 6
inches and the perpendicular height 11
inches.
2. A piece of board is the form of a tri
angle, with one angle a square angle. The
sides containing the square angle are 3
feet 8 inches ar.d 2 feet 9 inches. The
board is 4 inches thick. How many board
feet does it contain?
3. An office is of the shape shown in
the figure. BC is IS feet and AD la 15
! feet. Find the value of the inch flooring
i required at !'â _â¢ cents a foot, adding 10 per
i cent (one-tenth) for waste in cutting.
4. Two streets running- east and w-^st
and north and south cross at right angles
at A. A point B is 2 miles due north of A,
and a point C is 4 miles due east of A.
! How many acres in the trianglar piece of
land represented by the figure ABC?
(Noteâ There are G4O acres in a square
mile).
5. An office building Is of the shape
ABCD. It has a frontage" (BC) of 48 *eot
on one street, and the corner D is 50 feet
or fickle, or easily affected by circum
stances.
Regimes-Pronounced "ray-zheem." The
word regime is used to designate a sys
tem of government or management
throughout Its existence or throughout
the active life of Its head; as, the Glad
stone regime in England.
Versatileâ Pronounced "verse-a-teel." A
man who can very easily turn himself
from one kind of work to another is said
to be versatile. Commonly applied to
people who can do a great many things
and do them well.
Suaveâ Pronounced "swahv." A suave
manner is one which is smooth, pleasant
and gracious, but with an undercurrent of
deceit. The word suave is really synony
mous with courteous or bland, but in its
common usage there is the added meaning
of deception or shallowness.
Cuisineâ Pronounced "kwee-zeen." This
name is commonly used to signify the
entire cooking department of a hotelâ the
actual food served, the style of cooking,
the cooks, the service and the entire culi
nary department. We say that a partic
ular hotel is chiefly known for Its excel
lent cuisine.
Causticâ A thing: Is caustic which burns
by destroying the tissue of animal sub
stances, hence this word is used to mean
cutting or severely critical; as, a caustic
remark. We say a sour face, sharp words,
bitter complaints, caustic wit, cutting
Irony, biting sarcasm, a stinging taunt,
harsh judgment. The caustic utterance is
meant to burn, but purposely to burn out
the bad.
These are all very common words, and
few If any of them may be new to you.
They will, however, suggest the kind of
word which we advise you to look vp â
words which are common in conversation
and which you know in a general way,
but which you are not sure of.
Let us now look at a few word com
parisons. Take â¢'custom" and "fashion"
as examples. Custom is authoritative: it
stands in the place of law and regulates
conduct. Fashion is arbitrary and ca
pricious; it decides In matters' of trilling
import. Customs are as unchangea)
fashions are variable. "Necessary" and
"expedient" aro also examples of words
which, though similar, are yet different.
A thing is necessary when "it cannot be
avoided or omitted : the expediency of a
thing is a matter of discretion an<l"calcu
lation. It may be expedient for one per
son to consult another, but it may not be
necessary.
"Character" and "reputation" are words
often confused. A man's character la
what he really is; his reputation is merely
people's opinion of him. Gossip may in
jure a man's reputation, but it cannot af
fect his character. A man may have a
pretty good reputation and yet a' very bad
character.
These comparisons are interesting. Take
the four words, "fanaticism. " "bigotry,"
"Intolerance" and "superstition." They
are all of the same family, and yet they
are very different in their application. A
fanatic Is one who is extravagant and
foolish in his zeal for a particular cause.
A bigot is obstinate and unreasoning in
his attachment to a cause or a creed.
Fanaticism and bigotry include intoler
ance, which is an unwillingness to tol
erate any belief or opinion contrary to
one's own. Superstition is ignorant or
Irrational faith, such as believing in
omens or magic. Bigotry is narrow,
fanaticism is fierce, superstition is Ignor
ant, intolerance is severe.
Look up "insurrection" and "rebellion,"
"justice" and "equity," "option" and
"choice," "counsel" and "admonish."
"shun" and "evade," "usually." "gen
erally" and "ordinarily"; "accurate"
"exact," "precise"; "delusion" and "illu
sion," "zeal" and "enthusiasm." "foreign"
and "alien." "abstain" and "refrain."
"vicinity" and "locality," "defective" and
"deficient." You will find the exercise a
good one.

EASTERN MARKETS
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Oct. 31.â Prices of stocks fell
at the opening to-day and under the weight
of selling for London account. The market
at that center was In a state of semi-demorali
zation on tho news of the loss of a considerable
force of British troops by capture from Lady
emith. The sales for foreign account In New
York ran up to nearly 60.000 shares. The re
sulting loss In prices reached a point or more
In several prominent stocks, notably among
the Southern railroads, which have been recent
favorites for a rise. The experience of yes
terday left no one disposed to buy stocks and
the London offerings were poorly taken. Ac
tive selling of some of the prominent stocks
ad.lfd to the weakness. After the opening de
cllnu, however, s.jnie support was forthcoming,
which Feomed to bo based on the hope of a
relaxation in the money stringency but quo
tations for money at 30 and 25 per cent again
turned prices of stocks downward. The specu
lative liquidation seemed to be concluded about
noon and there was some recuperation during
the latter part of the day. which was en
couraged by strong spots in the list. The iron
and steel stocks became especially prominent
led by Federal Steel. The strength in this
group was attributed to a demand from a large
outstanding short Interest. The rise in Fed
eral Steel reached SVi nd in Steel and Wire
3%. There was nympathetlc advances in Na
tional Steel, Republic Steel, American Tin
Plate, American Smelting and other iron ana
FtfÂ»el shares running from a fraction to 2};
the latter In National Steel. There was a
good demand for a number of other prominent
specialties, but railroads, especially those in I
the Southern group, retrieved a good part of
their early losses. The Wisconsin Central new
stocks were conspicuous for an advance to
about v above last night's level. The mar
ket closed firm, generally at small net losses
The call money market was very feverish all
day. receding several times, but recovering
violently and suddenly. The last loan was
at 6 per cent, the low level and the rate ranged
above that to 30 per cent, the demand being
apparently urgent and targe. Loans were
called by the banks on an extensive scale. The
demand for time money was good and lenders
demanded 6 per cent on choice collateral. The
extensive calling of loans is attributed to needs
for the first cf -November settlements, and
there is a demand reported also for payment
of subscriptions to some new Industrial com- i
bination*. The rate for sterling exchange de
clined further in response to the Iff money
rate and without regard to the hardening of i
the money market In London. New York ex
change at some Southern points weakened
sharply and the sub-treasury was a creditor
at the clearing-house to-day to the extent of
1126,000.
The tone of the bond market was better
than that of stocks and a number of middle
and low-grade mortgages were In good demand.
Total sales, par value, $1,970,000.
United States bonds were unchanged in the
bid quotations.

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, Oct. 31.â "Wheat opened firm ami
during the first few minutes advanced mod
erately. Higher cables and a drop In British
consols, due to the English military reverses
at Ladysmlth, made shorts apprehensive for a
time, but as foreigners were reported heavy
sellers at the seaboard this feeling soon dis
appeared and a slight reaction took place on
prof't-taklng. Reports of an important In
crease In the German duty on Wheat en
couraged liquidation, but as the session pro
! gressed the market became extremely dull,
with long pauses between trades. Enough con
i fidence was manifested In 'December "Wheat at
I around 70c, however, to prevent any material
decline until an increase of but 1,190,000 bushels
' In the visible supply was posted where double
that amount hail been expected infused a lit
tle animation Into the trade. Shorts covered
freely in the late trading, under which the
market took a. sudden upturn and -closed strong
within a fraction of the best price of the day.
December opened %c higher at 70>i@70%c, ad
vanced to 7OV4c, declined to 70>/gc and closed
| with buyers at 70% c.
Corn was active but somewhat unsettled.
The market declined under heavy liquidation,
owing to a slack shipping demand and dis
appointing cables. A decrease of 469.000 bushels
in the world's visible, coupled with enormous
clearances, forced shorts to cover near the
end and the early loss was fully regained,
the market closing strong. December closed
at 31% c.
A good cash demand strengthened Oats and
the October option got on even terms with
December, scoring an advance of U@%c. The
other futures merely held their own. â¢ Decem
ber closed at 22% c.
Provisions were dull and Irregular. Packers
sold Lard and Ribs owing to continued heavy
receipts of hogs and lower prices at the yards,
but Pork ruled strong on account of the un
certainty about the proper interpretation to be
put upon the amended rule concerning barreled
Pork. January Pork closed a shade higher,

Harrison's circular says: "Since the Mariposa
left the following cargoes of coal have arrived
from Australia, viz.: Westminster, 1500 tons;
Pathan, 2512 tons; Helensburg. 2469 tons; Wil
liam Tlllie. 2910 tons; total. Â»331 tons. Of the
above four arrivals two are steamers which
have been chartered to the Government for
transports. Any unsold cargo of Colonial coal
would now come to a good market, as the yards
have but little on hand and are offering same
very sparingly. There are reported on the
chartered list from the Colonies for here, twen
ty-four vessels, with about 67,000 tons capacity.
At this time last year there were thirty-three
vessels. 98,000 tons capacity. This appears most
singuar, when the inducements for tonnage to
seel; this port are so much greater now than
in IS9S. The Honolulu demand has been the
principal factor in diverging Colonial freight
from this port and is still continuing to do so,
as they are ottering over five shillings per ton
more for freight on coal than we can afford to
pay. Our local fuel market is about entirely in
the hands of our coast collieries, so that busi
ness with them this year is exceptionally profit
able. They have not marked prices up, BO that
foreign producers have not become as generous
shippers of 'coal as if the local market had es
tablished high figures, which can readily be
done at any time, where so few persona con
trol the entire output of the coast and the
stocks on hand are so extremely small. Now
that outward grain freights have reached a
maximum figure we may assuredly look for an
Increased loading list from Australia."

TALKS OF PUNS
OF SOCIALISTS
Against Labor-Saving
Devices.
CLAIMS THEY CAUSE ALL WOE
THE LABOR AGITATOR TAKES
BRIUHT VIEW OF FUTURE.
Addresses an Immense Audience
Metropolitan Temple Which
Gives Evidence of Sympa
thizing With Him.
hi (i.-.NE V. DEBS.
Eugene V. Debs, the labor agitator, ad
dressed an audience last evening that
filled every available bit of space In Met
ropolitan Temple. That some were at
tracted there by curiosity there Is no
question, but that the great majority
"were in hearty sympathy with the theo
ries advanced by the speaker was also
amply evidenced.
There is not much that is musical in the
address of Debs. He is not an orator,
and makes no pretense of being one. At
times in his talk he wanders far from his
subject, and at others he places no more
expression in his words than a schoolboy
speaking his first piece. But he has the
happy faculty of appealing to an audience
of workingmen, and that is his stock in
trade.
The train that brought him here yes
terday from Seattle was late, and he did
not reach the Temple until a little after 9
o'clock. He is a tall, young appearing
man, well groomed, and having the ap
pearance.of being well fed. He is any
thing but a living example of the misery
tli.it he pictures as existing among the
working classes.
In opening his address he apologized for
causing the. audience to .wait Tor him,
claiming that the trouble was caused by
a crippled engine on the line of the South
ern Pacific Company.
"If I had had the power of a Federal
Judge.'- he aid, '"I would have issued an
injunction against the connecting train,
restraining it from departing without
ni'-." Debs spoke at length on what he
claimed to be the evil of labor-saving de
vic-is. ikying to them the blame for all
iho r, a i or imaginary troubles of the
ivnrkinpnian.
"In days of old the laborer controlled
the tools with which he worked and he
received the fruits of what he produced,
Then there were no millionaires, no
i ramps, no workingmen in enforced Idle
ness. I have sympathy for the tramp, for
he is a victim of our nefarious latter-day
system; in the creation of which he- took
no part. The tramp is a living rebuke to
our bruited Christian civilization."
Mr. Debs dented that the country is en
joying an orn of prosperity. Hi- claimed
that the wnges of the laborer were never
at so 1"W an ebb as they are at present.
He spoke particularly or the coal miner,
"without whose labor the wheels of In
dustry would cea?o to revolve," whose
wage?, he Bald, averaged but 11 per day.
"Life is a curse for him from the cradle
to the grave. He creates wealth which
he is not permitted to enjoy. While we
â¢ â ialm to be a Christian people we are not
half civilized.
"The railroads are sain to be extremely
prosperous, yet the man who does the
most work gets the smallest pay. The
section hand receives for his labor on an
average but SI 10 a day. You cannot cross
the continent on a railroad train if the
section hand is not Ing his duty and
on duty. The railroads are operated
purely for private profit. They pay their
president $60,000 yearly and his chief duty
is to see that the section man gfrts no
more than $1 10 a day. These railroads are
\ho greatest irrupting power of modern
times."
Th*Â» aker impressed on all who sym
pathized with the socialistic movement to
stand true to their colors, and not be led
n-.vay from their party by alluring'prom
ises of politicians. He said that the only
way In which they could accomplish any
thing was by the ballot and that it was a
useless weapon If they used it for parties
in hose principles they did not believe.
He said the future appeared bright and
that the lay was not far distant when the
people would rise up in their might and
claim their own.

Unitarian Church. In a letter to Colonel John P. Irish, chairman of the
board of trustees, Mr. Mills saya he is so improved with the "noble

their pre.it cordiality and hopeful enthusiasm," that lie has decided to
preach on Sunday morning from now on until the first of March next year.
Rev B Fay Mills, over his signature, made public a statement to-day in
reply to Rev. Dr. DHle'a remarks of lasi Sunday nipht. when the Methodist
minister severely arraigned his old friend. In this statement Mr. Mills Â«ays:
"So far as Dr. DiHe Is concerned, I have for him nothing: but the kindest

OIL DISCOVERED
NEAR ORINDA PARK
BF.RKFI.EY. Oct. 31.â Oil has been discovered near Orinda Park, about
ten milrs from this city, and tne residents of the district are in a fever
of excitement over the prospect of turning their ranches and farm
land? into a region of oil wells. The lucky find is the result 6t an ex
tenflive Bystetn of boring; which has been carried on for some weeks on the
Miner ranch. For Several years the presence of oil has been suspected in the
vicinity, but no systematic effort had been made ta push the search forward.
Wells to the depth of some 300 and 3<*l feet had ben dug, with little encour
agement. ht-weVer, to indicate the existence of the fluid.
The recent discovery in the San Joaquin Valley of oil at the depth of 2000
feel prompted a further investigation of the attempts once abandoned at
Orinda Park. Horing apparatus was secured with the intention of carrying
the excavation down to 2<X>o foot if necessary. Toward the close of last week,
at a depth of 300 feet, the fluid sought for was found in a well on the Miner
ranch.
The Prctoloum is very dark in color. Its presence at such a depth, to
gether with the conditions attending its discovery, encourages the prospec
tor? to believe that it exists in the region in sufficient quantities to be
worked rind put upon the market. On the Miner ranch boring will go on till
the 2(*>o reel mark has been reached. Similar explorations are to be made in
all the land adjoining.

One Man Killed and Another Fatally
Injured.
RED BLUFF, Oct. 31.â As the result of
a railroad accident which occurred here
shortly after 9 o'clock to-night, one un
known man was instantly killed and his
partner, Charles Staples, is fatally In
jured. Both were stealing a ride on the
westbound freight, which arrived here
about that time.
As the freight reached Cone & Kimball's
warehouse the men' left their positions
under the car and rode on the side to the
Kimyon warehouse. At that place there
is a side track, on which several freight
cars were standing. The men did not
notice" the cars in time, and as there was
not room enough for them to pass they
were knocked off and under the wheels.
The unknown man was cut in two, the
wheels passing over his abdomen. Staples
had both legs cut off above the knee. The
former was taken to the Morgue and the
latter to the hospital, where he recovered
sufficiently to say that he came
from Nevada County, where he had a
family. He did not know anything about
his partner except that his name was
Fred. Both are younp men. Staples gives
his age as 30 years. He will die.
RILED CUPID AND WAS
STABBED WITH A FORK
OAKLAND, Oct. 31.â Fred Rodulett, a young laborer residing in Fruit
vale, has come to a sad realization that it does not pay to interfere in
the matrimonial troubles of a sister or her love affairs. Because he so
interfered he received a stab In the left cheek and another on the top
of his pate from a table-fork, which, he declares, his sister, Mrs. May Ed
wards, viciously manipulated. Moreover, he was arrested on a charge of dis
turbing the peace, preferred against him by his sister, and he was taken to
the County Jail by Deputy Constable Harmon, after his wounds had been
dressed at the Receiving Hospital. And it all came about in a most pe
culiar manner.
Mrs. Edwards is the wife of Robert Edwards, a telegraph operator of San
Francisco. The couple had not been living together in the sweetest hap
piness, and so the wife had recently returned to live with her mother at
Fruitvale. At the unseemly hour of 1 o'clock this morning Fred Rodulett
heard sw r eet murmuring* in the parlor and, suspecting that his sister and
her husband had made up, he stepped into the parlor and turned up the lowly
flickering lamp light. Intending to congratulate them upon the reconciliation.
He was horrified to find his sister sitting in the lap of a man. whose name
he does not know. The stranger hurriedly took his leave. Fred chastised his
sister for her actions, when, he claims, she rushed to the kitchen, procured a
table fork and stabbed him In the cheek and on the head. She then gave
alarm and summoned an officer to arrest the brother for disturbing her peace.
In the tussle with his sister Rodulett's left thumb sustained an abrasion and
his right thumb was sprained, and at 2 o'clock he appeared for repairs at
the hospital in charge of Harmon.

and through her generosity." The bal
ance, he said, he sold. The exact amount
realized he did not remember, but it was
between $12,000 and $14,000. because the
lady wanted to raise some money. He ad
mitted, too, that he had sold the shares
she gave him for about $23.0*10 and said
that though she was ill a great deal of
the time and sometimes not in her right
mind she was in her perfect senses when
she made him a present of the bank
stock. Finally Wakeman declared that
his fee at the time amounted to $IJ>.<Wt.
The money realized on the lady's bank
stock he said he disposed of according to
the orders of the lady herself in different
ways, and even the $5000 lost on a hook at
the races he said was in accordance with
her instructions.
An objection by MePike to the question
of the lady's mental condition at tne time
of the race track Instructions was sus
tained and the citation was dismissed.
There is still a suit pending in San
Francisco by Lady Yarde-Buller against
Wakeman for the recovery of property
she claims he is withholding from her.
MASKED ROBBERS
INVADE A SALOON
OAKLAND, Oct. 31.-Three masked
men, all armed, held up the proprietor,
bartender and another man in the Bay
City saloon shortly before midnight and
made a haul of nearly a hundred dollars.
The robbery was conducted in the reg
ular style. Peter Christensen. the owner,
and A. Boyson, bartender, were balancing
the cash register, when the robbers en
tered. "Throw up your hands," cried one.
and Christensen, thinking It all a joke,
replied that the bluff would not work. A
second command and the exhibition of
three guns persuaded the proprietor to do
as he was ordered. One of the robbers
then pulled the telephone off the wall.
while the other two ordered the victims
to stand facing the wall, which they
quickly uid. Christensen was ordered into
a corner by himself, and while one robber
helped himself to the money in the open
till anrl on the counter another took every
cent that was in Christensen's pocket anil '
the third busied himself pointing hi? gun
first at one and then at another and in
giving orders to his pais. After ordering
the three men not to turn around for sev
eral minutes the robbers hurried off.
"The whole business took less than
three minutes," said Christensen, "and
the fellows had evidently laid their plans
The first thing they did when we had all
held up our hands was too pull down the
telephone. The fellow who seemed to be
boss called the other two off when they
had gone through me and told them not
to bother with McKee and Boyson They
got the drop on us so we did not attempt
to do anything that they would not like
Altogether they got away with over 180."
The Ray City saloon Is situated at Sec
ond and Washington streets, on the water
front, and after dark is a very lonely
locality.

NO DANGER
OF POLICE
INTERFERING
Jeffries and Sharkey May
Punch at One Another
Without Molestation.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Oct. 31.â There will be no
interference by the authorities at the
Jeffries-Sharkey heavyweight champiun
ship battle to take place at Coney Island
on Friday night. Chief of Police Devery
is authority for this statement. The Call
correspondent asked him about the ru
mor to the effect that he would stop the
big battle.
"There is absolutely no truth in it."
said the Chief. "1 have no idea of stop
ping- the bout. The Fitzsimmons- Jeffries
affair, held in the same clubhouse, was
properly conducted, and I have assur
ances from the oiilcials of the Coney
Island Club, which is a regularly incor
porated organization, that everything
pertaining to the match will be strictly
according to the Horton law. The po
lice arrangements will be very similar to
those that prevailed at the Jeffries-Fitz
simmons contest. I will probably take
personal command of the men at the ring
side."
Chief Devery's statement insures a fair
and square contest, with the decision go
ing to the bettor man.
To handle the crowd on Friday night
special trains will be run on th* Elevated
Road from the New York side of the
bridge, beginning at 6:30 o'clock, and will
run on a ten-minute headway. Trolley
cars on the New York side of the bridge
to the club's arena will be run every two
minutes. Especial provision has been
made by the trolley lines and the ele
vated road to care for those returning
to the city after the contest. ~
The clubhouse on Friday night will be
lighted by the apparatus operating the
moving picture machine. There will be
400 incandescent lights shedding brilliancy
on the ring. It was found in experiment
ing with the lights to-night that they
greatly enhanced the view of the men
in the arena- Â
In the contest with the sailor Jeffries
will occupy the northeast corner, the one
he occupied when he defeated Bob Fitz
simmons for the championship of the
world. Sharkey will bit in the southeast
corner, the one occupied by Fftzsimmons
when Jeffries knocked him out. This
was agreed to at a meeting between
O'Rourke and Brady to-day. O'Rourke
wanted the southwest corner, because he
considered it a lucky one, as all of his
men fighting in that corner have proved
successful. As Jeffries won the cham
pionship from Fitzsimmons in the north
east corner he was very naturally pleased
with O'Rourke's selection.
Jeffries will be seconded in his fight
against Sharkey by Will Delaney, Tommy
Ryan, Dick Dolan. Jack Jeffries and
Brady. Sharkey's advisers will be Tom
O'Rourke, George Dlxon, Bob Armstrong
and Tim McGrath.
Both Sharkey and Jeffries have agreed
to weigh in before the battle begins so as
to let the public know exactly what each
man weighs. Jeffries probably will fight
at 212 pounds, while Sharkey probably
will weigh seventeen pounds less.
The big fight will be preceded by a ten
round bout between Kid Goulette of
Rochester and Tommy Moran of Brook
lyn. They will light at 128 pounds. Time
will be called at R:ls o'clock.
Jeffries and Sharkey have agreed to be
in the clubhouse at 9:15 and to enter the
ring at 9:45. The California Hercules will
come up from his training quarters at
Allenhurst on Thursday and will attend
the battle between "Will Curley of Eng
land and George Dixon of Boston, to take
place at the Broadway Athletic Club. On
Friday afternoon Jeffries will attend a
matinee at one of the local theaters,
leaving Immediately after thf> perform
ance for his hotel at Coney Island, where
he will remain until called to enter the
clubhouse.
Betting- on the big fight opened In earn
est at the Aqueduct race track to-day".
The biggest bot recorded was $1000 to $SOO
between Eole Pursall and Fred Walbaum,
the former laying the odds on Jeffries.
On account of tne storm to-day Jeffries
had to abandon his road work and confine
himself to training in the gymnasium at
Ashury Park. His exercises consisted as
usual of sparring, rope-skipping and bag
punching. Jfffrics worries little ab<>ut his
fight with Sharkey, feeling confident that
he will have no trouble in disposing of
the sailor.
Dr. F. F. Coleman of Asbury Park ex
amined Jeffries to-day and said he w.is
one of the best-developed men he ever'
saw. The doctor further said the Call
fornian's wind was good and his heart
sound as a bullet.
Little credence is given the report that
Jeffric-s has sent a commission of $5000 to
this city to bet on himself. He told me
only a few days ago that he would not bet
a cent on the fight, and gave these reas
ons: That if he lost, which he did not
think likely, although such a thing was
possible, he would be out the amount of
the figure, and might see the time when
he would need tho money. If he won. a
few thousand would make little difference,
as he would have money enough without
the bet.
Delaney was in New York to-day on
business connected with the fight. His
plans have not been made public, even If
they have been matured.
Sharkey, at bis training , quarters at
Newdorp, to-day put in mrat of his time
bag-punching and boxing -with Armstrong.
He doea not s^m to need another hour's
preparation, and is in as fine trim as any
pugilist that ever entered a ring, so far
as the eye can tell.
If he is as well trained in science as he
is bodily, he ought to put up a groat bat
tle. His handler? are all as confident as
their principal, and their talk is of the
kind that seems somewhat calculated to
make the former sailor overconfident. He
does not appear to have succumbed to
this, however, and says he knows he has
a hard proposition on his hands when he
pits himself against Jeffries, but Insists
ne will win.

VICTORY FOR HORACE DAVIS IS ASSURED
Phelan Tries to Hush

Shameful Betrayal of the

that they were losing ground

test, they resolved to aban

having been assured that ha will not be
disturbed in the management of the Fire
Department If Phelan wins out. The, new
contract between the fat boss and Phelan
perhaps extends to the management of
iblic schools under the new charter.
Phelan balks at nothing in the path of j
his political ambition. He denies all !
knowledge of the preconcerted plot to j
hound Horace Davis, and hlB denial is
given for what It Is worth. The Call Is !
In possession of Information directly at j

that he was not Informed by Rainey in 1

Examiner and Phelan as the most odious j
and ignorant b< ss that ever brought dis- I

the special confidence of the Democratic j
nominee for Mayor. Phelan. Dodge and I
Lane get out before the people and make j
anti-boss speeches, promising good gov- j
eminent under tlie new charter, but the i
real business of the campaign is done at
the St. George stables, and Stun Rainey

Mayor Phelan Is busily engaged between

A straight story is told by Colonel ,
William MacdonaJd and George W.
Turner that places Geary in a sorry j
light. Through Colonel Macdonald's
influence Geary, who was a good drill j
sergeant and a Democrat, was kept in
the Mint for a long time by General !
W. H. Dimond, the Republican super- I
intendent. When the force at the !
Mint was diminished and Geary had
to be let out he was taken into i
Colonel Macdonald's insurance office i
and given employment. Subse
quently Geary sought to sell to Mr.
Turner, the manager of another in
surance company, information ob
tained in Colonel Macdonald's office.
When Geary was confronted with the
facts of his treachery he confessed
his g-uilt.
Will Phelan now confess?
The Call believes from all the facts I
obtainable in the case that delegates !
in the convention were endeavoring !
to present Mayor Phelan the trus j
history of Geary's record when the \
Mayor impatiently waved them
aside, uttering the remark: "Geary i
may be a scrub, but we must do poli- i
tics and put him on the ticket."
Colonel William Macdonald, the
manager of one of the insurance com
panies concerned, and George W.
Turner, the manager of the other,
were positively informed that the
protests were made to the Mayor
the night Geary was nominated.
The Call knows that Phelan sent
for one man to smooth over this
transaction, and knows further that
strenuous efforts are being made it

with the facts.
Mayor Phelan cannot plead ignor

POLITICAL. ________
THE WELFARE OF OUR CITY.
Horace Dav!s deserves the support of every man who has the welfare of the
city and the State at heart, Irrespective of party. He is a man of exceptional
ability, la thoroughly in accord with the necessities of the municipality and emi-
nently quail to undertake and execute the many public improvements under
contemplation. As a leading member of the charter convention he is thoroughly
versed in the provisions of that instrument, and, therefore, fully able to In-
augurate the new system of government. There is a further reason why every
Republican should remain steadfast to the party principles at this time above all
others. Wen the Democrats to have the naming of the army of appointees un-
der the charter it would intrench them bo firmly that California's position in
the Republican column would be Jeopardized In 1900.. There must be no back-
eliding this year.
Will MakeJJodel Mayor.
I cannot Indorse the candidacy of Horace Davis for Mayor too strongly. His
life has been a model that every young man should strive to follow. With him
directing the destinies of San Francisco the people will be assured of an honest,
clean progressive administration. The nomination of Horace Davis appeals to
cverv Republican with especial force; there will not, must not, be any hesitancy
in rallying to his support. Political exigencies alone, without consideration of
his personal worth, demand his election. Too much is at stake to intrust the
" municipality in the hands of our opponents any longer. By allowing them to put
Into operation the new charter it would make their position in the city and State
Impregnable for years to come. Republicans must work this year as they have
never worked before for the success of their ticket.

WATER-FRONT VOTERS
CHEER HORACE DAVIS
HORACE DAVIS and his fellow candidates on the Republican ticket never received a heartier reception than that
accorded. them last night at Sailors' Union Hall. East and Market streets. That particular vicinity has long
been regarded as the center of a Democratic stronghold. When James G. Magulre addressed the voters tnere
last year they fairly raised the roof for him. Last night they raised It for Horace Davis and the Republican
party. The particular reason, as voiced by one of the speakers, was that James G. Magulre this year was not mi-
Ing "his voice for the Democracy advocated by the opponents of Mr. Davis and the other Republican candidates.
"Where is James G. Magulre In this campaign? Where is William Broderick and Harry Creswell and others wno
pleaded the cause of the Democrats last year?" were the questions asked. "Are they advocating the election ortne
Phelan ticket?" and the answer came from the large audience, "Not much! 1 ' That is why Mr. Davis and his ienow
candidates were cheered by the men who voted last year for James G. Magulre.
James E. Murphy, one of the many men that have worked for Horace Davis, furnished one of the pleasant Inci
dents of the meeting, when he arose unsolicited to tell of the good deeds done for the poor by Horace Davis.^ Mr.
Murphy Is no orator, but no orator so far in this campaign has made such a telling plea to the working classes ror
"I'm working for Uncle Sam now," he said, "and he's the best man I ever worked for with the exception of Hor
ace Davis."
And the stories he told of Davis 1 generosity to the poor fully bore out the statement.
In opening the meeting Chairman J. J. Donahue paid a splendid tribute to the Republican candidate for Major.
"Horace Davis," he said. "Is the man who fought our battles for us in the halls of Congress when Chinese im
migration threatened our shores. You owe it to yourselves to elect him. If we do not we'll die In his debt.
"Well do it!" "Never fear!" "Rah for Davis!" and no signal was necessary to start the three rousing cheers
that grÂ«Â«ted the name heading the Republican- ticket. â¢Â».â¢â¦
Colonel T. V. Eddy, who was the first of the speakers of the evening, began his remarks with the statement that
In his opinion this was the most important municipal election in the history of San Francisco. Mr. Phelan ana nis
organs were trying, he continued, to make the people believe that there was only one question at issue, and that was
me "Thei"r statements to this effect," he said, "are nothing but fustian and subterfuge, cheap claptraps of dema
gogue politicians. Does Mr. Phelan pretend to say that San Francisco will be deprived of home rule if so be that
the Republican candidates shall be elected? No; he knows better. No; he knows that is false pretense ban t ran-
Cisco has always had home rule, and If at times that rule has been corrupt the blame must rest upon the shoulders
th "What^s the issue In this campaign? It is not home rule-it is the question who shall rule. It is a question
whether or not you will place the administration of this city's affairs in the hands of James D. Phelan and his party, or,
on the other hand, you will trust your affairs In the hands of Horace Davis and the Republican party.
"Horace Davis "is the foremost citizen to-day of San Francisco. He has fought always the battles of the people
without fear or favor. In the halls of Congress he fought for the law against Chinese Immigration, although by doing so
he was threatened with the loss and did lose his trade with the Orient, amounting to no less than $250,000 a year From
the day he voted against Chinese immigration to this he has never sold a pound of flour in the Orient. He Is your
friend; he Is the man I ask you to vote for! Will you do it?"
A chorus of "We wills" swelled Into cheers for the Republican candidate for Mayor in answer to the question.
"You should." replied Colonel Eddy, "and I firmly believe you will."
In conclusion the speaker called attention to the attitude toward the Phelanltes of men formerly high in the councils
of Democracy. , ,Â«_.Â».Â« tâ¢,,
"I want to ask any Democrats that may now be in this hall." he said, "where your leaders are to-night? Will you
tell me where that great, able leader of the Democracy, Hon. James G. Magulre. is to-night? Is he supporting Mr. Phe
lan In this campaign? Not much. Where Is William Broderick and Harry Creswell and other distinguished Democrats,
who were wont to be in the forefront of battle? Why are they not behind Phelan in this fight? I will tell you. It is
because they know that James D. Phelan does not represent Democratic principles in this campaign. It Is because he
represents Phelanlsm. not Democracy." "
Congressman Julius Kahn. who was received with great applausf. spoke only a few moments. He said that while the
Phelanltes decried the raising of national issues, the people of San Francisco could not forget that this city's present
prosperity was due to the policy of McKinley. He asked if the voters of San Francisco were prepared to slap that ad
ministration In the face by failure to return the Republican candidates,
A new speaker appeared in the campaign in the person of James E. Murphy, a painter on the Government trans
ports' who worked eight years for Horace Davis and came voluntarily to testify to the warm heart the Republican can
didate for Mayor had and has for the poor.
"I am a laboring man," he said, "painting transports for I nele Samâ and let me tell you now that Lncle Sam is a
mighty good man to work for. He is the best man I ever worked for with the exception of Horace Davis. I worked for
him Herht years, and I know."
When cheers at the heartfelt utterance had subsided, Mr. Murphy drew more and more with his stories of the good
deeds be had seen performed by Davis, whose hand was ever ready to help the poor. The speaker was nut polished in
his remarks, but his story appealed to his hearers.
"I worked for him eight years." he repeated, "and I take pleasure now in recommending him to every man in San
Francisco. He knows our necessities. He's born a laboring man; he has earned many a dollar with his coat off; he
knows the wages a working man needs to support wife and babies and he's always paid them. He is in touch with us.
He has always been a friend of the poor."
Mr. Davis, John Laekmann, Charles 11. Jackson, A. P. Black, William A. Deane and other candidates addressed the
meeting, which did not adjourn until after 10 o'clock.
men told him that Geary -was a
traitor to his employer and benefac
torâtold him that Geary had be
trayed a trust and offered to sell the
secrets of his benefactor, but Phelan,
the boss programmer, pushed them
aside with the declaration, "We are
doing politics now and must put a
man with shoulder-straps on the
ticket."
The Call submits the proposition
to thâ¬ conscience of every good citi
zen whether Phelan did not in his raw
work of forcing the nomination of
Geary for County Clerk under these
circumstances betray the people cf
the city in order to advance his own
political ambition. Phelan had
knowledge of Geary's bad record, but
he thought he could suppress tha
truth, fool the people and catch the
soldier vote.
Mayor Phelan ran talk in a gracious
?tvl""to a meeting of citizens, but when
it comes to doing practical politics behind
the s=cenes of a convention n<- is the raw
est programmer that ever cracked a whip.
He can crack the whip over cringing
Democrats and line up the weak. l>ut he
makes a mistake when he attempts to
swing the lash over the heads of Repub
licans. The arrogant declaration that he
would if chosen Mayor, exclude from the
municipal commissions under the new
charter all Republicans who introduced
national issues in the campaign, was the
threat of a tyrant. Wbere does Hielan
get the right to tell the 80.000 Republicans
of San Francisco what issue they shall
Â,i>Mder "On what meat doth this our
CaeÂ«nr feed that he has grown so great?
Ho defines every utterance in favor or up
holding the magnificent administration of
President McKinley as treasonable, and
calls every Republican who fails to march
under the Phelan banner a traitor to the
row charter. He gete this notion of raw
politics from the St. George stables.
It may be well enough for Democrats
who have lost their manliness and inde
pendence to vote for Phelan and a ra-es
taUishment of the Rainey regime, but for
Republicans to countenance or consider
the proposition to vote for the boss-in
fected nominee for Mayor on the 80-Called
Democratic ticket Is worse than folly. San
Francisco business men may contribute
materially to the prolongation of the
city's prosperity in a commercial sense by
voting for Horace Davis. On the con
trary a vote for Phelan will block pros
perity. The election in San Francisco
next 'Tuesday will be accepted throughout
the T'nited States as an index of the po
litical sentiment of California. If th<*
Democrats win the result will be pro
claimed far and wide as a rebuke to the
Republican party from a great city that
THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL. WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 1. 1899.
REPUBLICANS SHOULD
BE ON THEIR GUARD
The people who are Interested
in the prosperity and development
of San Francisco are rallying to
the standard of Horace Davis.
As the campaign progresses the
prospects of Republican victory
brighten. Tt is the judgment of
impartial spectators of the can
vass that Horace Davis will win
out. The Republican leaders are
confident that Mr. Davis will be
elected by a handsome majority.
The greatest danger in a political
campaign is over-confidence. Ten
days before the election last No
vember Democratic leaders and
speakers were confident that
Judge Maguire would carry San
Francisco by 8000 majority, but he
lost the city by 3000. It is true
that he was the victim of a politi
cal sacrifice. Mayor Phelan ob
tained Republican votes, which
should have been cast for Charles
L. Patton, in return for Demo
cratic votes for Gage, which
should have been, under rules of
party fidelity, cast for James G.
Maguire.
Republicans should be on their
guard against trading In this elec
tion and they should exercise spe
cial vigilance in watching the
count. The truth Is now manifest
that Sam Rainey, the notorious
Democratic boss who was once
cartooned by the Kxamlner as the
chief of taxidermists, on account
of his dexterity In stuffing ballot
boxes, Is now Phelan's confiden
tial political agent. Republican
watchers, therefore, should be or
ganized in every district, so that
every precinct may be watched
during the count.
The people have confidence In
Horace Davis. He is clean, noble
and upright. All of his life is
open to the people and his place
of residence is accurately given In
the Directory.
has derived an exceptional measure of
prosperity from the Republican adminis
tration. The Republican voter who fails
to cast his ballot next Tuesday for Horace
Davis and the Republican ticket will fall
short of his duty to his country, his home
and his party.
Joseph Britton and George K. Fitch
have lined up with R. A. Crothers of the
Bulletin and Sam Rainey of the St.
George stables in support of Phelan. It
may not be amiss to remind the people
who succeeded through the agency of the
Stratton primary law in downing the
bosses that Britton and Fitch went into
court to defeat that law.
ROUSING RECEPTION
IN PRECITA VALLEY
Republican Nominees Assured
01 Handsome Majorities.
Graham's Hall, on Alabama street and
Preclta avenue, was crowded to Its limit
last night with the Republicans of that
portion of the city, who came to extend
to thp Republican nominees a most en
thusiastic welcome. John T. Graham
spared no pains in having his hall hand
somely decorated for the occasion. The
chair was occupied by F. W. Warren, the
president of the regular Republican Club,
and a band of music waa in attendance
to enliven the meeting.
W. A. Deane, the popular nominee for
County Clerk, was the lirst speaker of the
evening. Mr. Deane met with one <pf
t hose warm receptions which was a fore
warning of the number of votes which
the Preclta Valley freemen will deposit
for him on election day. In his short ad
dress he outlined the duties of a County
Clerk and convinced his hearers that he
1h Just the man that knows how to con
duct such an Important office in the inter,
est of the taxpayers.
J. L. Nagle, nominee for Police Judge,
followed In a brief address, which was
well received.
Charles L. King met with a most eordlal
reception. Mr. King is the Republican
nominee for the office of Supervisor, and
from the manner in which he was greeted
by the voters of Bernal Heights and its
vicinity it is but fair to surmise that he
will receive a most flattering vote.
A. P. Black, the Republican nominee
for the Important office of District At
torney, received a warm and enthusiastic
reception.
Dr. E. Torello, one of the first settlers
of the valley under the heights, was quite
at home with his audience. They all
knew him and loved him for the many
acts of kindness extended to them and
their families in times gone by. The peo
ple's votes are sure for Dr. Torello for
the office of Supervisor.
Dr. A. D. McLean, nominee for Coroner,
in his short address assured his hearers
that if elected the remains of the dead
should be respected and their living
friends will not be annoyed and mortified
by having a half dozen undertakers
squabbling over the remains, as has been
done under former Coroners. He was well
received.
On the conclusion of the addresses by
the nominees the meeting was addressed
by Ed W. Close and E. Myron Wolfe.
Dan Sullivan, an old resident of Preclta
Valley, closed the evening's entertainment
by a happy address complimentary to the
Republican party, that did so much for
the whole people's prosperity, not forget
ting his friend and neighbor, Graham,
who was one of the most persistent Re
publican residents of the valley and whose
nail was at all times at the disposal of the
party free of expense.
The meeting dosed with three rousing
cheers for the success of the entire Re
publican ticket.
NORTH BEACH VOTERS
WELCOME MR. DAVIS
Candidate for Mayor Receives
Enthusiastic Reception.
Voters of the Forty-fourth Assembly
District congregated in large numbers in
Washington Square Hall, Stockton and
Union streets, last night and shouted for
Horace L>avis and the other candidates
on the Republican ticket. Dr. C. A.
Glover called the meeting to order and
introduced F. X. Schoonmaker of New
Jersey as the first speaker. The distin
guished visitor aroused a great deal of
enthusiasm by his clear and convincing
discussion of national issues. The men
tion of the President's mime brought
forth loud applause, as did also the re
cital of the good work done during his
administration. Thomas L,. Henderson,
candidate for Supervisor, pledged him
self if elected to look after the interests
of the northern part of the city. Abe
Kuef Introduced Albert Heyer. candidate
for Assessor, and also told of the splendid
services rendered the city by the Super
, visor. Owing to the illness of John Farn
ham, Ralph L. Hathorn dwelt on his !lt-
I ness for the office to which he aspires.
i>ouis Feusler, candidate for Treasurer,
was heartily greeted when introduced.
L,. G. Carpenter, Dr. T. H. Morris and J.
H. Scott were also present and addressed
the meeting. Frank Kingwell spoke for
A. P. Black and Abe Ruef delivered a
stirring speech In behalf of Mr. Davis. In
the midst of his speech the candidate for
Mayor entered and was given a noisy
greeting. He addressed the meeting and
in a sincere and convincing manner told
his listeners what he would do if elected
to the office. He said he was not in favor
of ornamental improvements, but im
provements of a practical nature. If
elected on Tuesday next he would see
that the city had good schoolhouses, good
sewers and other important improve
ments necessary for the health and wel
fare of the citizens of this city. When
tho speaker concluded the audience
cheered him and then dispersed.

EVOKES ENTHUSIASM
Mission Republicans Hold a Big
Rally in Thirty Third.
One of the best rallies of the campaign,
both In point of numbers and the enthu
siasm displayed, was that held last night
In Maennerbund Hall, on Potrero avenue,
near Twenty-fourth street. The Repub
licans of the Thirty-third District gath
ered In large numbers to show by their
presence the conscience they have in the
ticket headed by Hon. Horace Davis, the
bare menu <n of whose name during the
evening was suffiek-nt to cause hearty
cheers to resound throughout the large
hall. The audience was composed mainly
of tollers, who have donÂ«- so much for the
upbuilding of the community, and these
listened with liitelliÃe. t attention to the
forceful remarks of several distinguished
orators.
J. MrXamara acted as chairman of the
meeting and introduced the various
speakers in complimentary terms. Among
the candidates who appeared were: A. P
Black, candidate for District Attorney,
who made an earnest and dignified appeal
for the suffrages of his listeners; William
A. Deane, who pointed to his good record
as County Clerk as a just reason for his
re-election; Dr. A. D. McLean, nominee
for Coroner; John Farnham, represented
by J. D. Kersey, who bespoke for the for

Judge M. Cooney, who, in addition to ex
plaining tjie fitness of Mr. Scott for the
office, also delivered one or" the telling
speeches on the political issues of the day;
J. L. Nagle, nominee for Police Judge,
who promised to give a just and fair ad
ministration of the office and spoke a good
word for his fellow candidates; Charles J.
King, nominee for Supervisor, who pre
dicted a great future for this city if the
municipal government were placed in the
hands of the Republican party, and W. C.

Among the other speakers were: A. P.
Y;in Duzer, who disproved by statistics
the false claim of Mayor Phelan that he
had been the "watchdog of the treasury";
J. Goldman, a young orator, who clearly
elucidated the issues that affect the pres
ent campaign; C. F. Kimball, president of
the William A. Deane Club of San Bruno
road, who spoke eloquently for Mr. Deane
and honest John Lackmann, whom he
characterized as the next Sheriff of San
Francisco; and E. Myron Wolf, who paid
a glowing tribute to the sterling worth
and character of Horace Davis.
STANCH RICHMOND IS
FOR HORACE DAVIS
Earnest Republicans Heartily
Indorse Their Candidates.
Crowded with enthusiastic men and
womÂ«ii was Richmond Hall last night,
when Horace Davis addressed the For
tieth District Kepuhlicans. Bands nor
bonfires, though both were there, were
needed to key the audience up to the
cheering point.
Mr. Davis delivered a short, plain, busi
nesslike talk, in the course ot which he
said, remarking on .Mr. Phelan's opinion
that politics were at a discount as com
pared to citizenship in this election:
"It is impossible to separate party spirit
from this campaign. No man who wishes
to be ioyal to the administration which
has done so much for the building up of
this city can avoid voting the Republican
ticket. Not only by our protective policy
have we built up the internal trade of this
country, but this prosperity has followed
the flag to the Philippines and the Orient.
This city more than any other in the
Union has profited by this policy. I ask
you, in conclusion, to keep up a burning
spirit of enthusiasm, and on the day of
election we will roll up a good poll of
votes for good government, McKinley and
protection."
At the conclusion of Mr. Davis' speech
a voice from the packed lobby shouted
"Three cheers for Horace Davis!" and
they were given with a will. Other can
didates on the ticket who spoke were S.
Foster. Cyrus S. Wright. Charles Bliss,
Emmet Barrett and Leon Prescott. Wil
liam Watson made a hit when he called
on the audience to vote for the head of
the ticket. "Never mind the footâ that's
me," he said. "Scratch my name off, but
vote for Horace Davis, our next Mayor."
PHELAN ATTACKS THE
REPUBLICAN ORATORS
Roasted Schoonmaker and Called
the Charter Democratic.
James D. Phelan went before the Demo
cratic voters of the Twenty-ninth District
at Pioneer Hall last night and explained
to them in his peculiar way that the new
charter was essentially a Phelan instru
ment. Ho was ably assisted by Franklin
K. Lane and Assessor Washington Dodge
and "charts."
Every seat In the hall was occupied
when Chairman J. J. Sweeney introduced
the first speaker. There was a good band
.â unl a good quartet, but Mr. Phelan was
the whole show after several candidates
for Police Judge and Supervisorial jobs
had been heard. The Mayor's speech was
purely personal. He roasted everything
in the fight that was not Democratic and
varied his usual style by a vicious at
tack on Hon. F. X. Schoonmaker, the ora
tor who has lately been heard in behalf
of Horace Davis and the Republican
ticket generally.
Assessor Dodge proved to his hp. *-ers
that he had saved them thousands oi dol
lars whether they paid taxes or not, and
brought his well-known maps and charts
to prove his contentions. He held up the
fact that if any one than himself were
elected Assessor John D. Siebe would bo
the power in office and, although he made
no direct charges, he insinuated pointedly
that only disaster and crookedness would
result.
Franklin K. T.ane made an excellent
speech and was followed by Alfred J.
Fritz. Edward Mogan, Georgo Cabaniss
and other aspirants to office.
