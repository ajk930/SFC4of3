TO SAVE KILLARNEY FROM
VANDALS.

NEW YORK, Junv C. -President
Jarr.es J. Coogan of the borough
of Manhattan was highly en
thusiastlc when asked about the
plan to purchase XHlarhey and
make it a national park.
"It would be a rand undertaking
by the Irish-Americans of this city,"
he said, "and I can see no reason why
the scheme should not prove a great
success. It would mean thousands of
dollars yearly to dwellers' and inn
keepers in the neighborhood of Killar
ney and would lend an added charm for
visitors from this country.
"I will subscribe $1000 or $5' % 00 if nec
essary to insure the success of such an
undertaking, find I know of several
other New Yorkers who will gladly do
likewise. It would be a splendid idea
to ask the Herald to be custodian
erf subscribed funds and publish the
amounts received weekly. This would
incite the younger people to action, and,
in my opinion, the results would be far
beyond what might he expected.
"I believe that $lf.o.ono_ could bo raised j
in Greater New York fur such a worthy j
purpose in less than a week's time. We '
must preserve the beauties of Killarney i
for present and future generations."
Sheriff Thomas Dunn said: "A capi
tal idea. By all means let the Irish-
Americans of Greater New York get
log^ther and preserve the historic in
terests of beautiful Killarney. I will
do all in my power to aid the movement |
to make the place a national park to
be presented to the. people of Ireland
and maintained by purchasers of the |
historic spot. There should be no hesi
tancy on the part of any Irish-Ameri
can citizen of this city to help such a
grand movement, for many of our
younger folk will want to visit this ro
mantic country in years to come, and
the only way to make such visits pos
sible is to preserve the lakes and their
surroundings in their original condition.
Let every true lover of his â  other
country put his shoulder to- the wheel
and make Killarney Park, Ireland, a
lasting monument of his remembrance.
I am heartily in favor of such a plan,
and I am ready to contribute whatever
A MURDER MYSTERY
OF THE MOUNTAINS
OF MARIN COUNTY
Peter Lorraine, Woodchopper,
Disappears and His Partner Is
Arrested for Killing Him.
Ejv^clal Dispatch to The can
PAX RAFAEL. JunÂ» B.â The record
of Carson Canyon for miirrtcr myster
ies, already as dnrk as the shadows
lurking in its gloomy depths. has been
jT)rr<-a=r-'l bj the addition or what is
hollpv-pd to be another terrible crime.
Peter Lorraine, a woodohopper. is
missing under circumstances pointing
to foul play. ;md the finder of sus
pirion points bo unmistakably at a
companion named James T>i<-r. that hÂ»'
vfls arrested to-day, brought to this
rity and r.lH>.d j n confinement by Sher
iff Taylor.
Lorraine was a Frenchman, apod |
about 60 years, who had been employed i
by John Enoa for the past twelve
months. Bnos lives In Carson Canyon,
which is situated near Lakf> Lnerunitas,
ten miles from Pan Rafa<l. Down it
sweeps the i^aÃunitas; Creek, which]
unites with (ho San Geronimo noar th<
mouth of th<- canyon to form Paper
Mill Creek. Dier has been in Bnos'
f-mploy for about two y> .us, and is
about 45 years old. Both woodchoppers
lived in the same cabin, their rooms
being separated by a partition. Ever

"French Pete," wenl to work in c';. i -

bad terms and quarreled frequently.
Their i ompanions lived In

account of the fact that the nai

able, and their records while in Enos'

amount is considered to be my share to
insure its success, whether it is $1000
or more."
President Maurice F. llolahan of the
Board of Public Improvements was
also enthusiastic over the idea of mak
ing a national Irish park of the lakes
of Killarney and the surrounding hills
and dales.
John F. Carroll had this to say on the
subject: "You may count me in on that
scheme from the beginning. I consider
it a very broad-minded idea and one
which can only result in good to all
Irishmen and Irish- Americans. "We
should take steps at once to acquire
the property and waters and to pre
serve them as they now are â one of the
wonders of the world. I will willingly
subscribe any fair amount to insure
the perpetuation of Killarney."
John D. Crimmins thought a Killar
ney national park a feasible scheme
when I called on him last night. He
thought there was a wide field here yet,
however, for the betterment of Irish
men, but he said he thought the plan
would result in bringing the needs of
the Emerald Isle closer to the hearts of
other nations.
"Killarney Park would be a splendid
monument of loving remembrance from
Irish-Americans here to those at
home," Mr. Crimmins said.
Justice "Wauhope Lynn, Councilman
John T. Oakley, Councilman John Mur
phy and Aldermen McEnern.ey, Har
rington and Mclnnis were equally en
heard of him slwe. His clothes and a
small sum of money were left in his
room, and nothing showed that he had
;my Intention of taking "French leave."
When he did not appear the next day
Enoa Inquired of Dier where Lorraine
and with a great sh.>w of agita
tion the latter answered:
"Oh, he'll be back all right in due
time."
As the days passed on ;m<] no sign of
Lorraine appeared the men began to
talk and make ugly remarks over Dier
and Lorraine having quarreled ;i day
or two before his disappearance. Things
finally reached such a pitch that Enoa
notified Sheriff Taylor last Sunday.
After an investigation that officlai be
came satisfied thai Dier wa,s guilty of
murdering the missing man and ar
rested him to-day. Dier declared the
arrest unwarranted and made a great
ado when the manacles were slipped on
his wrists, but grew quieter when they
reached jail. He is an evil-looking fel
low, with a heavy mustache, bushy side
whiskers and ratty eyes, deep-sunken
in their sockets. His reticence in re
gard to his previous whereabouts con
vinces the authorities that he must
have a reason for keening his record
unknown. All thnt could be learned
from him was that previous to g<-ing"

employed by a man named Miles

chase Killarney by popular subscrip

A correspondent of the Dublin Free
man writing to that journal says:
in a few weeks !)!>â¢ Muckross estate,
which includes the greater p;irt "f the
land and water making up the beautiful
of Killarney. will be offered for
s;ili'. 1 havi the strongest reason for be
lieving that a syndicate hits boon formed
for the purpose of buying the Muckross
c and working the lakes ;it a profit.
The syndicate believes thai by -cutting
down the One woods on Ton* Mountain a
large immediate return would be obtained.
Valuable wood also exists In othor parts
of th<- demesne.
It Is proposed to utilize the water power
of Tore waterfall by converting it by a
turbine into electrical energy and convey
ing the same to Muckross House, which
is to be used as a factory for extracting
the valuable chemical compound, carbide
â  lum, from the limestone with which
the estate and the country around
abounds. There Is a large sale of the
calcium caTbide for the manufacture of
acetylene pi^. It is believed that further
cal â¢ m rgy caa be obtained from
the How of the waters from the upper
lake.
Kfforts will be made to acquire Innis

out as a tÂ»-a garden (probably with negro
minstrels, merry-go-rounds and other
amusements, such as prevail in similar
plaoes on the English coasts. l>inls Isl
and will be similarly treated.
Steam launches will be placed on the
lower lake and will make the rounds of
the lake every half hour.
It is believed that a large additional
revenue can be obtained by the company
from a substantial increase in the tolls.
It is proposed to charge two shillings for
passing from tne gap to the lakes, one
shillinp for admission to the Tore water
fall, two shillings for admission to Muck
ross abbey -thus doubling the present
charges- and two shillings for every boat
passing up under Hrickeen bridge, the re
turn journey to be frÂ»v-.
As the whole of Muckross I^ake will
pass to the syndicate, one idea which is
at present under consideration in to fit
out a flotilla of boats and allow no others
to pass through the lake. It is also pro
posed to tit out a small electric tramway
to make the rounds of the Muckross
demesne, to which no ordinary cars will
be admitted. A funicular railway will be
erected to the summit of Tore and fre
quent firework displays will "be given at
Muckross abbey.

pers' ramp and was never heard of
again: in l^ii the same was true of
William Shields, and in lKf>2 Antony
Lujar was sent to Kan Quentin Prison
for stabbing Marfus I'isa to death.
Tt was in a hollow tree in this canyon
that recently Henry Hazen Abbott,
whose life has been recounted at length
in The Call, almost buried himself from
the sight of man for thirty years, after
fleeing from Contra Costa County to
save his life.
The chief credit for the evidence dis
covered leading to Dier's arrest belongs
to Bertha Stedman. the young daughter
of the overseer of the Shafter estate,
who learned of a quarrel over money
matters occurring between the prisoner
and the missing man a day before he
disappeared. She also learned that Lor
raine was Jast seen on a lonely path
leading from the store kept by Enos to
the woodchoppers' cabin. He was on
his way home when last seen. Dier has
failed to account for his whereabouts
at this time.
Late to-night Dier sent for Sheriff
Taylor and while sticking to his story
that he is innocent of any crime him
self endeavored to accuse John ESnofl
by innuendo. He told the Sheriff that
Enos appeared last Sunday with the
key used by Lorraine and entered the
latter's cabin.
"How did Enos get this key if he
knows nothing of Lorraine's where
abouts? " queried Dier. Several years
ago Enos and Frank Bernard, another
woodchopper, were brought before the
Grand Jury in connection with the dis
appearance of the cook, Johnson, but
nothing incriminating could be elicited.
Lorraine's knife, which was manu
factured out of a file with the an
nounced determination of killing a man
known as "P"rench Charley." has been
found near the cabin. Developments
are coming so fast that Sheriff Taylor
has set a man to watch the cabin with
Instructions to permit nothing to be
touched. District Attorney Mclaaac
secured the services of a San Fran
cisco detective to-night, and in com
pany with the Sheriff the two will visit
tiie cabin tc-mbrrow. The authorities
fully believe they are on the track of
What will prove to be a premeditated
assassination, which may afford a key

APIA, Samoa, June i (via

June 6 .) â Mataafa and thir
teen chiefs and their followers, in
fifty-two boats, met on ihe
United States transport Badger
on May 20. They promised to
submit to the decision of the joint
commission.
The British gunboat Pheasant
and the Badger went to Malic 10
--day to disarm the Mataafans,
who have 2000 rifles. The com
mission will probably compen
sate the natives for their arms.
Malietoa Tanu will then dis
arm his followers, and they will
withdraw to their ships.
The new civil government has
commenced operations. It has
been simplified, and strong, eco

will probably be recalled.
The question of indemnity is
being considered. It is estimated
at $200,000. The kingship is
still undecided. It may be decid

NEW YORK, Juno 6.â A conference i
of Republican Congressmen of New

for the Speakership of the Houa
Representatives was held at the Fifth
Av< nue Hotel to-day, and resulted in
a d( cision to support David 1.. Hen

:. after this those in the confer

said that Mr. Henderson ol Lowa, hav

man. An informal discussion followed
and it was decided to support Mr. Hen

Representative Sherman was request
ed to telegraph Mr. Henderson, notify- !
ing him of this action. The conference I
then adjourned.
The conference was attended by six
of the Kepublican Congressmen of this
State and six of the other were com
municated with by telephone or other
wise, so that twelve of the New York
delegation of fifteen had decided for
Henderson. Mr. Payne, before leaving;

The naval authorities and the mis
sion societies have submitted their
views to the commission, and the lat
ter, by proclamation, fixed May 27 as
the date for the natives to surrender
their arms. Mataafa, however, asked
for an extension of the time until to
day, when he surrendered 1800 guns on
board the Badger. The Maiietoans are
now disarmed.
The United States cruiser Philadel

Queen's birthday was celebrated with

British Consul and naval officers. The
procession visited the graves of the
British and Americans and tlv-n

over the German graves.
The natives are gaining confidence

The natives brought here from other

The residents of Apia express dis

consider this a bad precedent, but it is
admitted this is too early to criticize
the action of the commissioners.
The American engineering staff has
arrived here and will proceed to erect

Judge Mullan, the former American

ing supporters, Burton of Ohio and
Babcock of Wisconsin, have declared
That it will be his policy to preserve
the House organization as it stood in
the las; Congress as far as possible.
There will, of course, be some changes.
Men who have earned the right to pro
motion to more important committee
assignments will receive them and the
individual wishes of Representatives
will be consulted as far as possible, but
as .i rule, ac< ording to Burton and Sab
cock, there will be few changes in im
portant places. Of the Republicans
who were chairmen of committees in
the last House thirteen fail of re-elec
tion, leaving vacancies at the heads of
that many eo-minitteee.
In addition to these, the chairman
ship of the Judiciary Committee will
be vacated by the promotion of Mr.
Henderson, while Mr. Payne of New-
York was chairman of both the Ways
and Means and Merchant Marines and
Fisheries committees after Mr. Ding
ii y's death. It is probable there will
be only one Elections Committee In the
next House, so that Mr. Henderson
will be able, to promote thirteen men
to chairmanships without displacing
any one who was chairman of a com
mittee in the last Congress. There are
four vacancies on the Committee of
Appropriations and two on the Com
mittee of Ways and Means, which are
considered equal or superior to unim
portant chairmanships. There is a va
cancy on the Committee on Rules, thus
giving Mr. Henderson twenty places of
rtance to dispose of. Some of the
Republican Representatives think it
very probable that Mr. Reed will con
tinue to represent th" First Maine dis
trict in the House. In that event there
car. be no question of the position he
would occupy. He would take the
chairmanship of the Committee on
Ways and Means and would be a mem
ber of the Committee on Rules and the
Republican leader on the floor.

"A FAKE" THEY SAY

Greatly Exaggerated.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA BARBARA, June
6. â A letter received from
Clarence Libbey and Joseph
Price, who left here three
weeks ago for Lower Califor
nia, says the stories of the
new gold fields at San Rogue
are fakes. It costs $350 to lo
cate and it is impossible to
work a claim three months.
They found the reported dis
coveries exaggerated and have
left the country.
LOS ANGELES, June 6.â A party
of Los Angeles gold hunters is
to start for the new placer dig
gings in the Sierra Pintadas,
Lower California, and expects
to reach the gold field within the
next six days. The party was organ
ized by Captain Don Orril, an experi
enced placer miner, who has been in
the Klondike, and by James Irving &
Co., assayers of this city. With Cap
tain Orril Will go E. L. Bntler, R. E.
Dean, S. Collier, D. B. Low, T. L.
Stringham, Mert Evans, \V. T. Elliott,
A Comer, N. R. Miller, W. H. Kern,
E. L. Hall, Ben Barney, Whiteside and
Hoffman.
The party will sail from San Pedro
on the schooner Rambler, Captain
Crosby commanding. First it will go
to Knsenada to clear and next to San
Rogue, the landing nearest thÂ»* dig
gings, which are twenty-one miles from
the coast. The gold hunters will be
fully equipped with dry washers and
all necessary tools and supplies pur
chased here. They will tak^ two burros
and a mule to do their packing over the
desert. Irving & Co. sent a man to the
diggings a week ago and they are daily
expecting information from him. In
stead of waiting for advices from their
own representative the refining firm be
lieves the current reports of the re
glon's richness and has assisted in
equipping this party.
Antonio J. Florres. who is an attache
of the office of the Mexican Consul in
Los Angeles, has just returned from
Ensenada, where, he says, he saw and
heard the official reports of the consu
lar department there. To-day he re
ported the facts to his chief, General
Ouillermo Andrade, the Mexican Con
sul. When seen to-day General An
drade said:
"There is not the slightest doubt
about the present richness Â»>f the Sierra
Pintada placers. How long it will last
I cannot tell. No one can tell. It may
be for long, it may b* for a little while
only. There is gold there in plenty. It
only remains to be tak<-n out. There
are other regions of the peninsula that
are just as rich. The problem of water
has kept back development, but that
Is to be remedied. There is plenty of

placers." ___^__^^^__

terday he was put under arrest on his

other officer called to see him, when he
suddenly pulled a revolver from under

ADMIRAL DEWEY IS
NOW HOMEWARD BOUND
HONGKONG, June 6.â The United
States cruiser Olympia, with Admiral
Dewey on board, left here at 4 o'clock
this afternoon. There was no demon
stration. It was blowing and raining
hard at the time of the warship's de
parture.
Consul Wildman remained on the
Olympia until the last minute, with a
few friends of the admiral, who
on board to bid him farewell. At 4
o'clock sharp, the ensign was hoisted
at the main. The Olympia moved off
with the marine guard drawn up on
her poop.
While passing the cruiser Powerful,
the band of the Olympia played the
British national anthem and gave a
bugle salute. There was no firing. The
Powerful replied with a similar salute
and her band played "Hail Columbia."
As the Olympia passed the Italian ad
miral's ship the Olympia's band played
the Italian national anthem and gave
an admiral's salute, which compliments
were returned.
Then the Olympia's band played
"Auld Lang Syne," and the band of
the Powerful played "Home, Sweet
Home." Admiral Dewey Is apparently
anxious to avoid all demonstrations.

BRIGANDISM IS
ON THE INCREASE
THROUGHOUT CUBA
Most of the Desperadoes Are
Negroes Who Come From
Eastern Provinces.
HAVANA, June 6.â Brigandism Is on
the increase in the country and a reign
of terror prevails in towns where no
United States soldiers are quartered. The
so-called bandits are mostly negroes who
came from the east with the Cuban army
of invasion. They have taken full posses
sion of towns outside of the railroads and
are living there during the day and rob
bing at night.
Mariel is a town of 2000 inhabitants. At
the close of the war twenty negroes took
a school building for their quarters. Eight
of them raided a grocery next door Fri
day night. They fired at the proprietor
and took his safe containing $5000 into the
street and tried fur two hours to shoot tt
open with rifles. Finally they carried it
away on a truck. Other soldiers left tho
town on Saturday and probably joined
the bandits in the mountains. Four cat
tle were stolen on the outskirts last night.
Citizens have appointed eight resident
Cuban soldiers as police, but they have
little faith in the soldiers' ability to pre
serve order. No work is being dune on
plantations, and those who started work
have had their cattle stolen. Since the
robbery on Friday Spaniards have se
creted their valuables and barricaded
their doors day ami night.
Mayor Quaintana came to Havana to
night and asked Governor General Brooke
for protection. The Spanish Consul ca
bled the Spanish Minister in Washington
to-day advising taking action against the
1 nited States, holding the Americans re
sponsible for the death of Jose Lobregat
at San Antonio on Sunday. Lohregat was
killed by a mob of Cubans infuriated over
the fact that he was formerly a Spanish
guerrilla. His funeral occurred this af
ternoon. Feeling in the town is very bit
ter against former Spanish soldiers. A
Cuban soldier told me this afternoon that
when the republic was formed It was the
intention to kill all the guerrillas. Gen
eral Krooke sent to San Antonio a com
pany of the First Infantry- ytuuerday and
a company "f the Seventh Cavalry this
morning. General Rivera says there is no
fear of further trouble, but the Span
lards want a larger force and also gairi
sona in all towns.

SECOND BUTTLE
WITH OUTLAWS
Sheriff Joe Hazen Is
Killed.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHEYENNE, Wyo., June 6.â A sec
ond battle with the dynamiters of the
I'nion Pacific express train has been
fought in the mountains, forty miles
north of Casper, by th.; Sheriff's posse
which has U't-n in pursuit since Sun
day morning, and as a result one man
and probably more lie dead. The first
battle was fought Sunday on Teapot
Creek, thirty miles north of Casper.
No one was wounded during this en
gagement, but several horses were
killed.
The second battle was fought last
evening at a point ten miles farther
north and in a wilder country. The
robbers, being closely pressed, made a
determined stand behind some rocks in
a deep ravine, and when the posse put
In an appearance, opened fire at close
range.
Sheriff Joe Hazen of Douglas, Wyo.,
fell at the first fire, being shot through
the stomach. The officer was removed
to a safe place and afterward brought
to Casper by two cowboys, arriving
at the latter place this noon.
General Manager Dickinson of the
Union Pacific, who has been at Casper
since Monday, directing the work of
hunting down the robbers, tendered the
use of his private train, and Hazen
was taken to his home at Douglas. A
telegram from there this evening states
that the officer died shortly after reach
ing his home.
The posse resumed the fight as soon
as Hazen had been removed, and was
successful in a short time in driving
the robbers from their strongho-ld and
away from their horses, which were se
cured. The robbers retreated to a nat
ural fort among the rocks, some two
miles away, where they intrenched
themselves and prepared for a bitter
fight. The posse quietly divided up.and
surrounded the place, and when a
courier left the scene the officers were
lying on their arms with the robbers
completely surrounded and hemmed in.
An urgent request was sent in for re
inforcements and a supply of food and
ammunition.
In response United States Marshal
Hadsell of Wyoming, who had Just
reached Casper from the western part
of the State, where he had been hunt-
Ing for the other three train robbers,
started out with another posse and
with arms, food, ammunition and
horses in plenty.
The capture of the three robbers who
are hemmed In In the mountains forty
five miles north of Casper is now
thought certain, but whether they will
ever reach the railroad Is another
question, as there is intense excitement
in Casper and In Douglas, and talk of
lynching the robbers, if caught, Is plen
tiful.

fully, to attend to necessary private business. !
A parting word to the people (or whom I have
sacrificed thirty years of my life and to my
friends in the army just disbanded, which ac
tion should have been taken Instantly after the
removal nf the bloody weight of Spain's mercl- j
leÂ»R regime. We armed ourselves, and, ther>-- <
fore, we now no longer want soldiers', but m n
for the maintenance of peace and order, whlcb
are the basis of Cuba's future welfare.
It is necessary to understand that the naiMn ;
in this epoch, the most difficult In Its history.
should avail Itself of the opi>ortunity to show
that it possesses virtues in spite of the fleet
caused by colonial government and the harsh
ness of warlike life We wanted and depended
upon foreign Intervention to terminate the war.
This occurred at the most terrible moment c,f
our contest and resulted in Spain* defeat. But
none of us thought this extraordinary event
would be followed by a military occupation of
the country by our allies, who treat us as a
people incapable of acting for ourselves, and
who have reduced us to obedience, to submis
sion and to the tutelage imposed by forct of |
circumstance. This cannot be our ultimate fate I
after the years of struggle, and we should Aid
by every pacific method in finishing the work
of organizing, which the Americans accepted in
the protocol, and which is as disagreeable for
them as fcr ourselves. This aid wilt prove use- â 
less without concord among all the- it-landers. :
Therefore, it Is necessary to forget past dis
agreements, to completely unite all elements !
and to organize a political party which Is |
needed In any country.
It Is always said that countries have the gov- I
ernment which they merit .and Cuba will have '
that which her heroism entitled her to. To- I
day she can only have one party in Cuba, with '
one object, that of obtaining the aspiration of i
years.
We must devote ourselves to pacific labors,
gain the respect of the world, and show that .
though our war was honorable, our p-^aoe mvn j
be more so. We must make useless by our be- â 
havlur the presence of a strange power In the j
island and must assist the Americans to com- j
plete the honorable mission they have been '
compelled to assume by force of circumstances
This work was not sought by those rich ;
north.-rnf-rs. owners of a continent. I think :
â ioubts snd suspicions are unjust. We must |
form Immediately a committee or a club to be
ii nucleus of government. This will serve
Cut.a.
I, as one of the first Cubans, although one of
our last soldiers, and nut far from the grave, j
without passions or ambition, called on you
with the sincerity of a father and urged a
cessation of the superfluous discussions and the
creation of parties of all kinds which disturb
thf country and tend t" cause anarchy. In this
country there should not be one man whom we
consider a stranger. To-day we no longer have
autonomist* or conservatives, but only Cubans.
My mission having ended. I will absent my- |
self temporarily to embrace my family, but I J
will return shortly to Cuba, which I love as I
much as my own land. My last words for my
soldiers are that, as always, where my tent Is
the Cubans have a friend.

RUSSIANS SLAY
ELEVEN JAPANESE
Alleged Spies Lined Up
and Shot.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C, June 6.â
According to news received from
Japan by the Empress of Japan, which
reached port this evening, something
occurred about three weeks ago which
may hasten the conflict between Japan
and Russia. The arrest and summary
execution without the faintest suspi
cion of a trial of eleven Japanese, al
leged to be spies, which is reported
from Toshong, a Russian garrison town
on the Liaotung Peninsula, has so
wrought up the Japanese Government
that, although not yet ready for a great
conflict, it may slip the dogs of war.
The eieven Japanese, who were
accused of having been spies, are said
by the Japanese press to have been a
party engaged in scientific research.
They were landing from a small sloop
a few miles from Toshong when cap
tured.
They had just pulled the sloop up on
the beach and were securing it when
a number of armed Russians appeared
from behind a clump of rocks and
Belied them. Surveying Instruments
and scientific apparatus and several
cameras, which ih.> Japanese had with
them,- were instantly confiscated. Some
cases with a lot of data and plans were
taken from the sloop.
The prisoners were chained together,
marched to Toshong and imprisoned in
the barracks. Their confinement was
of short duration, for the next morn
ing, soon after sunrise, they were
marched out to the parade ground and
lined up at the foot of a bluff about
twenty paces from a squad of Russians
with their Krag-Jorgensens loaded
ready for the slaughter.
The Japanese pleaded earnestly for
their lives, but the only answer vouch
safed their outcries was the rattle of
the firearms of the Russians and the
eleven Japanese lay deadâ murdered,
for a trial had not even been spoken of.
The Japanese press is greatly excited
over the massacre and caJls upon the
Japanese Government to avenge the
dead scientists.
BATTLE FOUGHT BY
GERMANS AND CHINESE
jA,aid Upon a Temple Leads to a Con
flict in Which Many Mongo
lians Are Slain.
VICTORIA, B. C, June 6.â Advices
are brought from the Orient by the
steamer Empress of Japan that on May
is a sanguinary encounter took place
in the vicinity of Kiaochau between a
vast army of Chinese rioters and rebels,
said to have numbered between
and 25,u00, and German soldiers. Chi
nese telegrams to* the Jijl Shimpo of
Japan say that the conflict was the out
come of the action of the Germans in
ransacking some temples. A band of
Germans out on a foraging expedition
wandered into a temple, and, driving
out the priests and attendants, camped
there. They built a ftre on the brick
floor and disarranged the temple gen
erally. Some of the idols were broken
down, two being totally demolished.
L.ater in the day a number of Chinese
came tack to the temple, headed by
the priests. The Germans, deeming dis
crerun the better part of valor, fought
their way through the advancing Chi
nese ?nd fled. The Chinese pursued
them for some distance, but the Ger
mans, with the exception of two, man
aged to distance them. The two un
fortunates who were not as speedy as
their fellow Teutons were killed by the
excited Chinese.
The demolition of the idols caused
great excitement throughout the prov
ince. Proclamations were posted every
where calling upon the villagers to
arise and avenge the wrong done their
gods. Kiu, a rebel leader who has led
two big risings, then came forward and
planted his standard in the troubled !
district. Thousands rallied around him,
their avowed intention being to drive
the foreigners into the sea. When about
20,000 or more had gathered, the corre
spondent of the Shimpo says, a body of
German soldiers came from the Kiao
chau garrison to disperse them.
The Chinese moved several small old
brass cannon into position and opened
the conflict, but a charge from the Ger
mans soon silenced their ancient bat
tery. The charge also altered their in
tention to fight the Germans. They
broke and fled, the Germans pursuing.
About 200 Chinese and three Germans
were killed. Kiu and his lieutenants
have fled. It is said they are at the |
yamen of a magistrate of a village
about thirty miles south of Kiaochau,
who promises them protection. Further
risings are feared.

Special Dtypatch to The Call.
ASBFRY PARK, N. J.. June 6.â
Despite the extreme h<>at to-day, thr
mercury at times reaching iÂ«0 degrees,
Jeffries worked hard and put himself
Into bettor condition, if that were pos
for his coming: fight with Fitz- J
V' mmons. This morning his trainers
:lod to dissuade him from doing his
usual amount of road work, but the bie
boilermaker had no fear of the broil
ing sun and set out for Elberson in |
company With Ross O'Nell, who repre- j
sents William A. Brady, O'Nell riding
his bicycle. Jeffries was content to J"Â£
along beside him. When Jeffries re
turned to his quarters perspiration was
running off him in rivulets. A
rub down and a bath made him feel
better and he ate a hearty dinner. This
afternoon the aspirant for champion-
Bhip honors reeled off several miles on i
his bicycle. For the n^-xt two days he
will do more or less sprinting In
that he may become as active as pos
sible and at the same time Improve his
wind, which seems already as sound as
a dollar. Jeffries believes he will re
main here until the day of the fight SO
th.M he may avoid any excitement
â which would be bound to follow his ar
rival in New York. At the training
quarters it \\:>s said to-day the tight
probably would be sharp and decisive.
"If Jim' can get in a knock-out
punch on 'Fitz' early in the contest."
said "Jack" Jeffries, "he is going t"
giv<= it."
Those who have visited Jeffri?s'
training quarters within the last few
days s.iy thej do not s. â¢â  how he .an
lose, for he has youth and strength in
his favor and is equally as scientific as
Fitzsimmons.

Brady, McVey, Delaney and
Others Praise the Cali
iornians Prowess.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NE"W YORK, June 6.â William A.
Brady came to New York from Asbury
Park last night. When seen at his
to-day he said:
There is not the slightest doubt in the
I world that Jeffries will win. and in my
opinion he will defeat Fitzsimmons In
four rounds. Persons who do not know
have no idea of the force of the bjows
Jeffries can hit with, both fists. I have
: nothing to say derogatory to Fitzsimmons,
{ because he is ;t wonder; but 1 say Jef
i fries Is his superior in every way. "Jim"
an hit "Tommy" Ryan wherever and
whenever he wants to. "Billy" Delaney
went down to Asbury Park the other day
i" teach "Jim" some points, and "Jim"
made a monkey of him and then showed
him some points. If Jeffries ever hits
"Fitz' on the head he will break it open.
Fitzsimmons says he does not care any
thing about pictures and that he will tin
: ish the ti^ht in a few rounds. If Fitz-
I slmmons attempts to force the fighting
'"Jim" will knock him out In one round.
Jeffries has never been knocked down in
his life. He has never b< â¢ n hit on the
head by anybody and has never borne a
mark there. He Is 6 feet l Inch In height.
11.- has the longest reach of any man In
the ring, and he Is every way the superior
of Fitzslmmons.
Then- is no question about the result
in my mind, but If Fitzsimmons by any
chance should win he will have proved
himself to be the m"st wonderful man
in th.- world.
Popular opinion is with "Fitz." That is
because Jeffries was badly managed (or
a while just after he came here two years
ago. He undertook to fight two men at
the Lenox Athletic Club In one night.
The second man was "Bob" Armstrong,
who Is the hardest man In the world to
put out. Jeffries split his right hand in
the tirst round, bui he fought ten more
rounds, injured as h< was, and heat Arm
strong then. But because he didn't knock
Armstrong out everybody said he was no
good.
Connie McVey, who trained Corbett
for all of his fights and who spent a few
days last week with Jeffries at Allen
hurst, N. J., where the latter is train
ing:, is a great admirer of the bo-iler
maker. To a reporter he said:
\\*hi!e I have never been in the hai
boasting about fighters' chances I can
not help stating that Jeffries will sum 1/
win and will he our next champion. I
never saw a man in such wonderful con
dition, so active and who has shown such
preat Improvement as Jeffries has. n.>
lihs youth, strength and vitality with hin
in this fight, and as Fitzsimmons has not
fought in two years 1 cannot sei 'i iw
Jeffries can
Hilly Delaney, who trains Jeffries, |
has issued a card, which follows:
To TVhom Fr Mny Concern: I notire in
thfs morning's papers that Fitzsin.tnons
i ; tims he will "go the pace" and put
Jeffries out in a round. Every man wh â¢>
ever fought Jeffries, with tile exception
of Peter Jackson. Instead of fighting him j
ran away from him. Bharkey mad*
same kind of a Least and when the bell
rang: he took to swinging tactics and con
tinued them until the finish of the fight
If there is any running away doni on
next Friday night Mr. Fitzsimmons will
be In the lead, with Jeffries a close sec
ond. I leave the public to Judge a.ft< r
seeing both statements which one is
right. Yours truly,
WILLIAM DELANKT.
ASBURY PARK, June 6.â â¢Tommy"
Ryan had this to say to-day:
I believe from the bottom of my heart ;
that Jim Jeffries will heat Fitzsim
mons, ami I base this calculation on my
kl owledge of Jeffriesâ of his skill and en
durano- thai I have witnessed every day
for the past six weeks. Never have '[
i man improve and catch the tine
points of his business as readily as .li-n
Jeffries. On the road and in the arena
hÂ« Is equally effective, and does !.i> work
with conscientious regard to the require
ment? of the big contract before him.
I will say this much further, that if
Jim Jeffries cannot whip Fitz now. he can
â¢'â â¢â  80, 1 auso ne will never again, j
to my thinking, reach the same state of
physical perfection which he has attained '
ince he began training for this fight.
My prediction is that the fi-ht will not
last mor* than ten rounds, and that Jef- !
fries will land a left-handed knock out
somewhere on Fitzsimmons' anatomy as j
a closing memento of the battle.

HANNA DECIDES
TO STEP ASIDE
NEW YORK, June 6.â The Washington correspondent of the Herald
telegraphs: If Senator Hanna Is chairman of the next National Repub
lican Campaign Committee it will be against his present intention and
desire. Mr. Hanna has already informed his close friends that he does
not care to take charge- of the Presidential campaign. His reason, as
his friends state It, is entirely based upon the state of his health. He
Is by no means a well man, and is to sail in a few days for Europe in
the hope of gaining his physical strength. He will go directly to the
baths at Aix Ips Bains for treatment to rid him of rheumatism, which
has taken a desperate hold upon him.
In addition to his bad health Mr. Hanna finds the time which he is
compelled to devote to political matters is making costly inroads upon
his private interests. He realizes that when he returns from Europe
the Ohio campaign will again demand his attention, and this will be
followed by the long session of Congress. If at the close of Congress
he continues to be chairman of the national campaign committee the
drain upon his vitality will be such as to neutralize all the good effects
of his trip abroad. Besides this he might as well close up his private
office.
In addition to these matters of health and private business Mr.
Hanna, as he told a friend recently, has had no opportunity to indulge
in any recreation. There is reason to believe, however, that there Is
more than ill health, business interests and a desire for relaxation at
the bottom of Mr. Hanna's wish to retire from the chairmanship of the
national committee. No one realizes more clearly than does Mr. Hanna
himself that he is looked upon as the special champion of trusts and
combinations, which will probably be made the leading issue in the next
campaign, and that he might bo a heavy load for the Republican or
ganization to carry. He desires Republican success and re-election for
McKinley more than any personal glory that he might get by manag
ing the campaign, and he will not hesitate to step aside.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALX, WEDNESDAY, JUNE 7, 1899.
SILER SAYS
'TWILL BE A

Referee Believes Jeffries
Will Give a Good Ac
count of Himself.
Bpecial Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, June 6.â George Siler,
who will referee the fight.between Fitz
simmons and Jeffrie., arrived in this
city from Chicago to-day, accompanied
by Mrs. Siler. When asked if he in
tended to confer with the principals
about the rules governing the contest,

he said that the articles were very clear
and did not need any interpretation so
far as he was concerned.
"The articles of agreement," said Si
ler, "provide there shall be no hitting
in breakaways. I shall see that the
articles are observed by both fighters.
Neither man can expect any favors
from me. I will be there to see that
they fight according to rules, and each
man can rest assured that he will see
fair play. Personally I have no choice.
I think it will be a great fightâ much
better than people imagine. If all re
ports circulated about Jeffries' condi
tion are true he should give 'Fitz' an
interesting argument. I think the
champion is a wonderful fighter. He
has beaten all kinds of men and nobody
has ever hurt him seriously. In Jef
fries he will meet a man who is much
younger than himself, considerably
heavier and very shifty with his hands
and feet. With both men in good con
dition a battle royaÂ» should be wit
nessed."
Slier will visit Jeffries at his training
rjuart'-rs to-momm and have a talk
with the <'alifi -rnian about rules and
other features of the battle. He takes
the trip also for the purpose of viewing
the boiler-maker's work and judging of
his condition. On Thursday the ref
!â¢!â â¢ â â  wiil call at Fitzsimmons' quarters
and have a, (hat with the champion.
Speaking of the suggestion that he ref
eree the fight from r.-utside the ropes,
Slier Bald it did not suit him at all.
"I believe in the American way of
Judging a fight," said Siler. "The only
way to judge a contest properly and
thoroughly is for the referee to be In
side the ropes. He is then In a posi
tion to keep close to the principals and
judge every blow. If the referee stands
outside the ropes a palpable- foul might
be committed. The referee might not
see it and a great injustice might be
done to the man injured. With the ref
eree inside the rones such an occur
rence is impossible."

TROUBLE
AHEAD FOR
MANAGERS
Coney Island Athletic Club
Building May Be De
clared Unsafe.
Pp<^ial Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. June 6.â There may be
trouble ahead for the "managers of the
big fight at Coney Island. Building
Commissioner John Guilfoyle of Brook
lyn Borough and some of the employes
of his office will inspect the Coney
Island Athletic Club building to-mor
row and decide whether it is a safe
place for such a gathering as is likely
to assemble there on Friday evening.
Mr. Guilfoyle received information to
day that the place is not only unsuit
able for the accommodation of a large
crowd, but it is unsafe. It could not
be learned who gave him this informa
tion, but it was said that it came
through the mails to-day. Mr. Guil
foyle decided to act promptly in the
matter. He will to-mnrmw visit the
club with his superintendent, one of
the engineers, two special inspectors
and the regular inspector of the dis
trict. The inspection will be thorough
and the building will be examined from
foundation to roof.
One feature of the inspection will re

the aisles. The building laws provide
that every seat except those in the
boxes must be nailed down. There is
another provision that the aisles must
be three feet wide at the nearest point
to the stage and must gradually widen
toward the exits. Some persons believe
that eight thousand persons cannot be
seated in the building without violat
ing these provisions of the law and Mr.
Guilfoyle and his assistants will try to
ascertain whether the aisles are to be
blocked with seats.
Mr. Guilfoyle will Issue orders that
all of the building laws be obeyed and
it is possible he may require changes
in the present arrangements. If the
building is found to be unsafe he will
order that it be strengthened immedi
ately. Failure to obey tho orders will
be followed by an application for an
Injunction from the Supreme Court re
straining the managers from conduct
ing the fight.

New York's Chief of Police
Says There Shall Be
No Slugging.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, June 6.â Chief of Police
Devery gave out the following state
ment relative to the action he will take
in case the Fitzsimmons-Jeffries fight
next Friday night resolves itself into
a brutal slugging match:
â¢ From certain published staterm nts of
experts on prize ring and boxing matters,
and from various sources, it would ap
pear that the two would-be pugilistic
champions who are down for a sparring
contest at the Coney Island Athletic ( lub
on Friday night next, or their backers or
managers, intend to have under the guise
of the Horton law not a sparring con
test but a genuine, old-time slugging
match or prizefight. If no such slugging
match is intended, then the inference is
that these statements and impressions are
spread for the sole purpose of gulling and
imposing on the public.
Considering the parties to the contract,
their respective weights. 210 and 156
pounds, and other attending circum-
Btancea and conditions, it is almost a
physical impossibility f"r the two indi
viduals referred to to carry on a lawful
contest for points on the coming occa
sion. The very nature of things tends to
an out-and-out prizefight.
I shall be present at the contest and, as
Chief of Police. 1 shall personally see to
it that the letter and spirit of the law
relative to such contests are obeyed, and
that there will be no slugging or heavy
hitting; nothing but a clean-cut, lawful
sparring exhibition for points. Any per
son who permits himself to he gulled or
imposed upon by thinking otherwise will
tind himself very much mistaken. It will
1..- well for the public to understand that
the first heavy blow struck will mark the
end of the contest.
COLORED GIANTS FIGHT.
Armstrong Knocks Out "Ed" Martin

NEW YORK, June 6.â At the Ignore f

Armstrong of Chicago and "Ed" Martin
( Denver. Martin had decidedly the bet
ter of the early part of the iirst round, as |

CHAMPION
CONTINUES
HARD WORK
Despite the Heat, Fitzsim
mons Does Not Let Up
in His Training.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, June 6.â Although the
contest between Fitzsimmons and Jef
fries is only a few days off, Fitzsim
mons is still working hard at his P.ath
Beach training quarters. It has been
the champion's custom when training
for a battle to let up considerably in
his work as the contest drew near,
but in the present instance he has dis
regarded precedent, and, although it
was pretty hot at Bath Beach to-day,
the champion cut down very slightly
the programme of work he had mapped
out for the day. "Fitz" said he needed
all the exercise he could take between
now and the time of the fight.
"Hard work," said the champion, "is
just what I need and I intend to keep
myself busy with all forms of athletic
exercise until to-morrow night."
On account of the extreme heat Fitz
simmons selectee] the tent for his exer
cise, instead of the barn. In the tent
Fitzsimmons enjoyed his usual amount
of sparring exercise, exchanging blows
with "Jack" Everhardt, "Yank" Sulli
van and "Dan" Hickey. He did not go
at his men as viciously as on former oc
casions, giving more attention to side
stepping, dodging and parrying blows
than to hitting exercise. This work
consumed about a half hour, and at its
conclusion Fitzsimmons tackled the
punching bag. He banged away at the
sphere in energetic style, and, although
covered with perspiration when he quit
j twenty minutes later, he did not appear
in the least distressed and his wind was
perfect.
Later the champion went for a spin
ion the road, covering five miles. He
finished in good style and immediately
received a good rubdown. The rest of
1 the day he spent leisurely loafing ,
I around his training quarters. Fitzsim- !
] mons said he was not in the least dis
| turbed by the desertion of several well
known sporting authorities from the
i ranks of his supporters. He said the
j opinions of the people counted for very
little. It was the work that the man
I did in the ring that won or lost the
j fight for him.
"The opinion of any set of men,"
j said Fitzsimmons, "never bothers me.
| They never win fights for any pugilist.
I It takes skill and good hard blows to
i win out in any fight. Talk cuts very
little figure."
The champion said he noticed Cor
bett betting on Jeffries at odds of 1 to 2.
"If Corbett," said Fitzsimmons. "will
take even money I will bet him as
much as he wants thai I will win.
"The weather," he added, "does not
I bother me at all, but I think it will
j worry Jeffries considerably."

Political Enemies Worry

HILLSBORO. N. Mcx.. June 6.âPro

was manifest t -.lay when Maj >r VV.
11. H. Llewellyn appeared for cross-ex
amination by his political enemies. Wit
had a bad memory, which he attrlb-
Illnese !.â  gave negative an
swers to questions as to his connei
with plots to murder Attorney Fall and
â  Lee. He admitted that he had
employed detectives after turning th(
â  â¢v. r iv the Sheriff. 11-- stated that the
graphic record of his former state
ments in some particulars was erroneous
and made .some corrections.
Fall's first, question was: "You testified
twice that the track in Las Cruces was
not the same as any of the three near the
blood ."
"He did not," interposed Attorney
Catron.
"When you state that you say deliber
ately and willfully what you know is
false," said Fall. "You are seeking to
post your witness."
tron then addressed the court and
continued to state what the witness had
taid yesterday.
"Now you have posted the witness as
you intend* d," said Fall.
"As to my language l v ill apologise to
the court, but n< I .. sir." said Ca
tron.
Refer* nee to the record was passed tem
porarily.
Witness paid: "Several measurements
were taken of horse and bool track- and
kept In my office but I don't know where
re now."
During a legal tilt Attorney Fall said:
We proj.. â ... that it was not the
original intention to prosecute the de
fendants, but that they were after me:
wanted to accuse me: but got In this and
' get out."
When the court refused (o allow th*
â¢ to ask Major Llewellyn this afler
ncon who prosecuted the Government's
suit against him while he was Indian
Agent at the Mes< alero Reservation,
Albert Fountain, eld st son of th* mur

the first party to find blood, and in
his excitement he thought be recos
bis father's hoot track near the blood
soaked spot, but was probably mistaken.
Some of the rm-n measured the tracks
, for future reference.
This was the last of the evidence for
the prosecution. The measurements of
tracks Beveral witnesses had mentioned
had not l>Â«-Â«-n produced.
Attorney Childers, for the prosecution,
asked to make a statement, and was
sworn in order to be cross-examined. He
explained that the last heard of them
i they were in a box in an office > Las
eS.
(in cross-examination, he said he fljd
not remember why the measurements
Were not produced -i; McNew's prelim
inary trial.
Attorney Barnes th,:: explained that he
had been directed by th.- possessor of the
trements to find them In a. box with
papers concerning the Fountain
case, but they were not there. The ; 1
cution thÂ«-n announced that the case was
in.
The defense moved that the court in
struct the jury to find a verdict of not
guilty. Attorney Dougherty cited that
th.- controlling feature was the bloody
find, and no evidence showed this was
; human blood, and it was not found within
:: week after Colonel Fountain's disap
pearance.
The court refused to hear argument.
and said he could not entertain the mo
tion. He might do so if it was the last
chance, but not under present conditions.
The defense asked an adjournment, say
ing they had much good evidence not
considered necessary, and could save
time by a conference this evening on what

in an adjoining field, saw the struggle
; and, unhitching one of his horses, armed
himself with a pitchfork and rode at full
speed upon the maddened creature. An

into the beast's haunches and fought a
battle that was worthy the efforts of a
matador. Other neighbors, through the
efforts of Anderson, were enabled to cap

SECRET WORK
IN THE CAMP
OF DEMOCRATS
A Scheme to Control
Local Nominations.
THE DETAILS OF THE PLOT
COMMITTEE OF ONE HUNDRED
WILL MEET TO-NIGHT.
Buckley Is Somewhat Reticent, but
Is Keeping Well Advised of Po
litical Deals and Talks of
the Past.
Everything on the surface of the local
Democratic party seems placid ;m<i se
rene, but there Is agitation In the depths
of the organization. The meeting of the
Committee of One Hundred at Native
Sons' Hall to-night may furnish a genu
ine surprise for A. M. Lawrence, who re
cently went forth for another vacation.
He had a programme nicely cut and dried
for recruiting the committee to the orig
inal maximum strength of one hundred,
and then eliminating seventy-five of the
members from the organisation.
i:.v this process he designed to place in
the hands of the remaining twenty-five
the entire responsibility "f providing the
party with B municipal ticket. The plan
contemplates the out-and-oul indorsement
of Mayor Phclnn's administration and the
renomination of tin .Mayor. It was f.in
cied by tin- clumsy manipulator that the
followers of Phelan nad no interests in
municipal affairs beyond gratifying the
Mayor's desire for another term. It was
expected, therefore, that they would fall
into line readily and accept the Lawrence
programme of Dodge for Assessor. ESsola
for Chief of Police and a lot of selected
material for minor places.
Late last night word was passed around
that influential and independent memtnrs
of the Committee of One Hundred had re-
BOlved to reject the Lawrence programme
and give to the nominating convention
the privilege of selecting the Democratic
municipal ticket. There is nothing in tne
proposed revision that threatens Phelan'a
prestige on the committee, but the friends
of Phelan maintain that his popularity
shall not be used as a means to give Law
rence and Rainey the control of the
works.
By general consent precinct apportion
ment will be recognized. The advice or in
structions of an executive committee of
the Democratic State Central Committee
will in this regard be respected- in fait
it cannot !>.â  ascertained that the Com
mittee of Qne Hundred ever contemplated
the plan of spreading out a blanket
ttvket. Assembly apportionment was
thought of, and the Mayor himself fan
cied at one time that Assembly sub-dl-
Vjslon was sufficient.
A plan which will be presented to-night
will provide measures for learning the
party strength in each district. It is not
proposed that representation In the con
vention Shall be based upon the highest
number of votes cast in the precinct for
any Democratic candidate, but the avt r
age vote will be put forward as the true
scale for ascertaining the representation
to which the precinct is entitled.
When details of this kind are adjusted
steps may be taken to appoint from each
Ass< mbly district ttiree wr-il-known Intel
ligent and Independent Democrats to act '
;is ;m auxiliary committee to assist the .
: I Committee of. < >iiÂ»j Hundred. There
ark no open siKns of a break between
Phelan and Lawrence, but the tatter's
clumsy methods and raw work In the in
teresi of. blemished and discredited poii- j
tlcians have alarmed the Muyor's friends
and Induced them to caution thÂ»- Mayor
against reposing faith In cither the sin
cerity or skill of Lawrence. Vigilance
will be observed at the meeting to-night
to detect signs of the Lawrence pro
gramme which proposes to distribute gold
bricks to seventy-five members of the
Committee of One Hundred and pive to
twenty-five men the power to name the
ticket.
) â â  . kUy, surrounded by his staff, is oc
cupying temporary quarters in the Emma
Bpreckels building, while the rooms in j
the Arcade, or Baldwin Annex, are in \
process of renovation. He receives daily;
reports regarding the work of the club
organization in the various Assembly !
llstricts. .Many of his followers are old
timers, as one readily learns by listening |
to the general talk at Buckley headquar
ters, yet they manifest much enthusiasm
In talking of the success of this or that
club. They are going about the work of
organization In a methodical manner,
noting that this man should be seen be
fore the club in his district meets, as he
has promised to "brinK in three of the
boys" who live- in his house. Ten or
twelve man were waiting to see the boss
when he arrived at his rimms yesterday
afternoon. They were admitted, one -by
urn-, to the inner ur conference room.
Buckley dwells with especial delight on
the record for economy in municipal af
fairs which was made during; the years
that Washington Bartlett and E. B. Pond
were respectively at the head of the city
government. Referring to the past, the
bo-s remarked:
"In 1881 the city was in a chaotic* con
dttion. The present situation of affairs
municipal reminds me of the condition
then. The local government Immediately
following the adoption of the new con
stitution was extravagant. The expense
of maintaining the County Clerk and As-
Bessor department was enormous. The
Supervisors, from whom much good was
expected, disappointed the public. When
the time came for selecting a new set
of officers Washington Rartlett and Jo
seph Clarke called on me at my office on
Bush street and wanted to know If some
thing could not be done to bring about
better and cheaper local government. I
invited them to sit down and talk over the
subject.
"In the course of the conference I sub
mitted tiie plan that the Democratic State
Club should recommend the Democratic
State Central Committee to appoint a
committee of twenty-five and that the
Democratic County Committee should
appoint an equal number. It was pro
posed that these fifty men should submit
a plan fur the reorganization of the
Democratic party in San Francisco. Out
of this grew the plan of forty-seven
clubs. 1 was in favor of placing John S.
Hager at the head of municipal affairs,
but the plan was changed and Washing
tun Bartlett made Mayor. Not only was
the dollar limit observed but the rate
was reduced to iÂ»8 cents. The debt in
curred by previous extravagance was
liquidated, the streets and sewers were
cleaned and good government was se
cured in all departments.
"We had a good deal of discussion over
water rates," resumed Buckley, "but we
managed to obtain material reductions.
Mr. Pond was not ready to accept the
nomination for Mayor when we proposed
a 10 per cent reduction of water rates.
The corporation objected strongly to the
proposed reduction, but I advised the
company to accept it. The corporation
resisted, and the result was the adoption
of anr order by the Supervisors reducing
the rate 16 per cent. The courts were
then appealed to, and while the right of
the Supervisors to tix the rate was con
ceded, the court held that the corporation
should have been heard, and so the order
was sent back to the board. The. com
pany was then ready and eager to accept
the 10 per cent reduction which I had
recommended. Another order was passed,
but the Mayor vetoed it on the ground
that the reduction was not sufficient."
In speaking of party bosses. Buckley
remarked that Hlgglns was the ablest one
that he ever met, and added that he had
met many of the most noted leaders in
New York and elsewhere.
MRS. HUMPHREY QUITS.
Suit for Breach of Promise Against
Capitalist Brown Is Dismissed.
The suit of Mrs. Alta Humphrey against
Capitalist C, Elwood Brown was dis
missed in the United States Circuit Court
yesterday morning upon a stipula
tion signed by Mrs. Humphrey and Mr.
Brown to the effect that the suit should
be dismissed, and th:*t each party should
pay his and her costs.
Attorney Crandall of counsel for Mrs.
Humphrey was in court, and said that
he had not been consulted in the matter
of the dismissal, but that if his client and
the defendant had signed the stipulation
he could not object to the dismissal.
The suit was brought about a year ago
to recover $100,000 damages for breach of
promise of marriage, the plaintiff being
a dashing widow resident of Chicago. She
represented that she believed Brown to
have been a single man and that, there
fore, she accented his attentions. She,
was in this city a short time ago, and it
is believed that the stipulation was
formulated while she was here.
As the counsel profess to know nothing
about the compromise, the particulars
could not be learned. The sum stated is
said to range from $5000 to $20,000. There
are rumors that Mrs. Humphrey had in
tended to bring a criminal charge against
Brown, but the rumors could not be sub
stantiated.

DEMOCRATS OF THE FORTIETH.
They Have Opened the Campaign
With Three Full-Fledged Clubs.
Democracy is above par out in the For- I
tleth District. There are throe clubs al
ready in the field and time for any num
ber beyond that to be formed. One mot
Monday night, another met last night,
and there will be a meeting of the third
next Monday night. "Ed Rock's Club" is
suspected of having Rainey affiliations.
It has among its members all the < >1 > l
timers who have served the party in the
Fortieth so long and so profitably. Last
night the second club, called for want of
a better name "our club," met. It is
"affiliated with no man and no faction"
Its managers declare, and the speeches
which smote the air from where it met
had for their theme Independence of ac
tion. Its president is Charlie Heggerty,
vice president, I >r. < '. V. Cross; corre
sponding secretary, Matt Brady, and Its
financial secretary, George. Kelly.
At the meeting last night there was
more than a hall full in attendance and
a full share of oratory and enthusiasm.
Ex-Judge Ferral, Henry Hogan of Napa,
who made such a g i ease out of such
a bad one in the Clark murder trial; Sid
ney Van Wyck and Joe Kelly were the
speakers, and they kept things lively un
til after 10 o'clock. There are over two
hundred on the club-rolls now and the
managers predict more to come. The
third club in the district belongs to M.
C. Hassett. It is a committee of on<
hundred dub. and BO far seems to have
earned the friendship of itself alone. The
other two dubs have no use for it, be
cause they say it represents the un-
Democraric principles of the committee
of one hundred. The Rock Club has
earned a bad name because when the club
was formed these most interested came
her and made themselves chairmen,
secretaries, committees and general man
agers and then they sent out invitations
to all the faithful asking them to com
in and make up the membership. The
dub which met last evening has no
faults according to its officers. Yet with
all three in field the Fortieth promise.- to
be a lively Democratic district before the
campaign is well on.

ADVERTISEMENTS.
RUPTURE,
One of the Worst Afflictions
of Mankind,
Cured Without the Use of
Knife by Dr. Sweany.
Varicocele and .Hydrocele Quickly Cured by
the Great Specialist.
Science and Skill, Coupled With Experience,
Again Proves a Godsend.
During the month of May nearly three score
of people who had all but despaired of â¢v. r
being cured of that dread affliction, rupture,
and many of whom were pronounced as hope-
less by other physicians, were made happy and
permanently cured by the celebrated specialist.
Dr. F. I;. Sweany, at his office, 737 Market
street. The doctor's treatment of rupture is
the result of that deep study and research, a
trait, which, with his knowledge art; experi-
ence' in medicine and surgery, '8 the main
cause of his extended and prolonged successful
practice on the Pacific Coast. The treatment is
known to but few physicians In die United
States, and is altogether different from that
employed by the old school of physicians of
the darkened M^es.
Varicocele, which drains vitality, makes life
a burden and forces early decay of the manly
powers. Is another of the diseases which Dr.
Bweany makes a specialty of. His scientific
and successful treatment of this disease has
proven a great boon to mankind. Thousands
have been cured by the doctor during his
twenty years' residence on this coast. "
Hy.lrocele and all swellings anil Impediments
are other specialties which Dr. Sweany attends
with unfailing success. Weak men are made
strong and old men made young. Organs of
the body which have been weakened or shrunk-
en are restored to full power, strength and
vigor. Contagious blood poison and all dis-
eases of the blood thoroughly eradicated from
the system.
ELECTRIC TREATMENTS.
The latest Improved static, faradic and gal-
vanic electrical appliances known to science for
the treatment of all nervous and chronic dis-
eases. Rheumatism, acute and chronic, Lum-
bago, Gout and all aches and pains quickly
succumb to the doctor's combined electro-
medical treatment. The miraculous effects In
the treatment of the above-named diseases are
to say the least, wonderful. Patients who for
months were unable to walk erect without go-
Ing through tortures and suffering excruciating
pains In the back, side and limbs, after one or
two treatments, stand perfectly- straight with-
out effort and walk without the use of cane or
crutch: DISEASES OF WOMEN.
Dr. Sweany takes special pride in the suc-
cess which has attended his efforts in the treat-
ment of diseases of women. Permanent and
satisfactory cures In ailments produced by ab-
normal or unnatural conditions of the female
organs, painful menstruations, irregularities,
barrenness, inflammation, hysteria, pain In the
back and loins, neuralgia, dullness of vision,
smarting pain and itching of the parts, bearing
down, leucorrhoea or whites and other com-
plaints which often result in great prostration
and nervousness. His combined electro-medical
treatment In all diseases of women really works
wonders. â  . â  . .
One of the features of Dr. Sweany's practice
Is that he will guarantee cures In all cases
which he accepts where his instructions are fol-
lowed out.
" The offices of Dr. Sweany are located on the
second floor at 737 Market street. â  -â â â â¢

FOR THE DEWEY MONUMENT
The Handsome Souvenir Certificate That Is
Being Prepared for Subscribers.
SINCE the meeting of the
Dewey monument committee
last Friday afternoon there
hns be^n turned over to ex-
Mayor E. B. Pond, the treas
urer, several thousand dollars
additional subscriptions, and every
member of the committee is still at
work with unabated enthusiasm. The
fund is growing day by day more rap
idly even than the most ardent sv.p
porters of the movement had hoped
for, but there still remains a large
sum to collect before the ideas of the
committee can be put into effect. It
is against the policy of the members
to announce the exact amount of sub
scriptions except at the regular meet
ings: consequently the total on hand
will not be known till next Friday,
when the committee meets again, but
from the way in which communica
tions have been pouring in from all
parts of the State it is quite evident
that the count ry. as well as the city,
has been aroused to prompt action and
is making speedy returns of its pa
triotic offerings.
Probably the most appreciated com
munication so far received from out
side the State is the message to Mayor
Phelan from John Barrett, ex-Minister
to Siam, who has recently returned
home after having spent several
months with Admiral Dewey during
the most critical period in the Philip
pines. Mr. Barrett is on the most in
timate terms with the "hero of Ma
nila" and probably understands and
appreciates the admiral's feelings as
well as any man in the country. Al

The members of the committee,
knowing of the friendship existing be
tween Admiral Dewey and Mr. Bar
rett, regard this telegram as the high
est possible indorsement of the pro
ject they have in charge. Moreover,
now that it has become so thor
oughly advertised throughout the
Fast and all eyes are turned to
ward California to see what the Gold
en State will do to honor Dewey,
when their own plan to give him a
house seems to be making little or no
progress, the local oommitteemen feel
additional pride and responsibility in
the success. California must not fail
to meet the expectations of the East,
for the statement has been spread
broadcast over the land that the mon
ument to the American navy and Ad
miral Dewey to be erected by Califor
nia is an assured success, and that
$100,000 will soon be raised for the pur
pose. The monument is an assured
success, but the committee is work-

members to have it ready for unveil

âº brutally kicked his wife last Sunday
5 night, endangering her life, appeared be

D the charge of battery against him. He
âº pleaded guilty, making the excuse that he
was drunk at the time and did not know
âº what he was doing. The Judge ordered
1 him to appear for sentence this morning,
âº and he will get the full limit the law
;- allows.
V The police regret that a more serious
I ' charge could not be made against Ward.
! as farts have come to light showing that
' ; his conduct in the past to his wife was
; i more than brutal. Two years ago she

EMIL SAUER AND THE PIANOLA
THE GREAT VIBTTJOSO PREDICTS
A FUITJRE FOR THE AGE
END PIANO PLAYER.
The Famous Pianist Visits the Ware
rooms of the Aeolian Company
to Hear the Pianola.
Mr. Saver, accompanied by Mr. Ernest
Knabe. Mr. William Knabe and Mr. Vic
tor Thrane. after listening to and playing
the Pianola, submitted to an interview
which is accurately reported as follows:
"It is really wonderful. I can freely say
the Pianola gives me more pleasure than
I have had from thousands of so-called
treats of pianistic effort.
"I have heard a great many musical in
ventions, but the Pianola is the first
â¢which has a reason for existing.
"It is sure to have a future. This is my
candid opinion. You know an artist often
has to assist a struggling brother with
words of praise a little exaggerated, but
in this case it is different. When I say
that the Pianola has a musical future I
am talking about, something I really be
lieve in.
"It plays 'La Campanella' of Liszt, and
other pieces which call primarily for tech
nical evenness, in really good style and
with a technique fairly astonishing. No
pianist could approach it.
"Of course in romantic or sentimental
music, in what I should call erotic music.
It must be less satisfactory, as the per
sonality or individuality of the player
counts for so much more in music of this
class.
"As I say. it will have a musical future.
I want you to send one to my home in
Dresden." Here is a card which gives ray
address: Hahnelstrasse 8, Dresden. Ger
many. As soon as it arrives I shall give
a reception to all the best musical people.
No musician can help admiring It."
Do won think there is anything to be
said about its usefulness to musicians and
composers and for musical purposes gen
erally?
"I certainly do think there is a great
deal to be said. Why. it will be of prac
, tical service to me. and I fully intend to
employ it in that way. You see. I often
have to practice a piece for two weeks
a.nd get it well under my hands before 1
can tell whether or not I can create an ;
effect with it. Sometimes I find that no
satisfactory effect can be produced, and
so lose my time and labor. For it is la- .
bor. Now. the Pianola would tell me this
In two minutes." \ â -;-;-
Mr Saver was much pleased with the
rendition of his 'Am Bache." but com
plained that the "Espenlaub 1 could not
be played rapidly enough. It was then
tried oh another instrument with a faster
j motor and played at correct tempo.
"I wish you would cut my 'Murmures
de Vent ' '' added Mr. Saver. "and also
my Galop de Concert.' They ought to be
lust the things to be effective. You also
might to have Balaklrew's Oriental fan
tasJe 'Islamel.' It is a horribly difficult
work, but the Pianola would play it beau
-1 tifully ."
Mr" Saver was asked what he thought
ibout the usefulness of the instrument to
;omposeps.
"I can see how your Instrument must
aid the cause of the composer." he re
plied "In disseminating a knowledge of
hie music. As It is now, hundreds. of mer
itorious compositions cannot get a hear
ing, consequently no one knows anything
jibout them. Some of these pieces get one
hearing. But that is not enough. Real
music to be appreciated must be heard
again and again."
Before leaving Mr. Saver expressed his
appreciation again, congratulating the
company for having produced the first
successful musical invention, and added,
humorously. "You American inventors
will kill our profession. The artists of the
future will have a hard time of It. In ten
years there will be no more virtuosi. No
player can do what that Instrument has
just done. It is not possible."
On Sunday afternoon a representative
of the Aeolian Company played for Mr.
Bauer in his rooms at the Hotel Savoy
and strengthened the impressions of thÂ©
previous day.
Statement of Emil Saver:
"I have examined all the pages of this
article with care. With some alterations
in the order of the statements, It agreÂ«3

any rate it expresses my views with ac
curacy." (Signed) EMIL SAUER.

from Acapulco. She is commanded .by
*';:pta!;i Betbeder, has ten officers, forty
midshipmen and 358 men. The Sarmifiito
entered port shortly after 12 m.. and was
boarded by the Federal quarantine officer.
Dr. Brooks. That ofliclal made a most
thorough examination of the warship and
kept h^r in the quarantine grounds fur
two and one-half hours. Consul W. V.
Loalza of the Argentine Confederation,
and Consul Estenos of Peru, who were on
the tug AWt. were unable to gro aboard
owing to the doctor'.^ orders.
Consul Loaiza expressed much indlgna
tion as to the length and carefulness of
the quarantine inspei tion, and thinks it
was extremely discourteous on the part
Of Or. Brooks to subject a warship to the
snitii' scrutiny that ie would a coasting
schooner which carries no medical man.
The war vessel will stay here ten days,
then go to Honolulu and thence around
the world. She is well equipped and her
arms are of the latest invention.
The barkentine \V. H. Pimonrl, which
arrived frnm Honolulu yesterday, had a
very rough time of it on the night of
June i. A heavy sale was encountered,
and tli" vessel was hove to. At 6:30 p. m.
a heavy sea struck ihe Dimond on the
port side near the fore rigging. Tt broke
aboard carrying the bulwarks with it and
smashed in the forward house. Three of
the sailors on watch below were washed
into the scuppers and got a number of
nasty cuts from the boxes and lumber
that was floating around the deck. The
gale then subdued and the Dimond
reached port without further incident.
The rush to the Sierra Plntada placer
gold mires from San Francisco promises

Among the many who have been seized
with a severe attack of the Lower Cali

to San Diego. He will take a large outfit
with him and is prepared to thoroughly
exploit the new gold fields.
The Fourth of July will be duly cele

aquatic exhibitions. Among the events
is ro be a rare of Whitehall boats, for
which there are twenty-five entries. Thir

There will also be a barge race, but the
prettiest of all these trials will be the
single scull races. Percy Henderson is

Raabe is on that of music.
The steamer Homer, operated by the
Alaska Exploration Company, left for
Cape Nome, via St. Michaels, yesterday.

THE MONUMENT TO DEWEY.
BEFORE the present week close? the subscrip
to the Dewey monument fund ought to
reach the sso,ooo mark. Reports given at the last
meeting of the committee show that nearly $30,000
have been already subscribed, and with that amount
to build upon the contributions to the enterprise
rapidly mount upward to the sum required to
carry out the undertaking upon the scale that has
been designed.
- any undertaking in California received
a warmer or a more general approval than has been
given to this. From one end of the State to the other
the word- of commendation have been spontaneous
and cordial. Even in the East the subject has been
favorably commented on and a due appreciation
shown of the fitness of San Francisco as a site for a
commanding monument to the admiral whose great
victory has given the United States a dominant pres
tige on the Pacific Ocean.
It is not the design of the promoters of the move
ment that the monument shall be the gift of a few
rich men. It is intended to stand for ages as a mani
:i of popular regard and admiration for the
tnd to its construction therefore all classes of
- are invited to contribute. The sum of Sioo,
--000, though considerable, is not a large one to be
raised in a commonwealth so rich and so populous as
California. Nearly one-third of it has been already
subscribed, and yet the work of collecting contribu
has hardly begun.
As the people of the East began to collect con
tributions for the purpose of erecting a mansion in
Washington for Dewey about the same time that the
nia movement was started to erect a monument
to him in this city, there is something of rivalry be
tween this State and the populous East to see which
will the more speedily and the more effectually ac
complish its work. California at present has a good
lead and the chances are will have the entire, amount
in Hght long before the East raises more than
â â : what is aimed at there.
There should be no delay in making contributions.
There 1- nothing in the situat.on to cause any one
to hesitate. The direction and management of the
enterprise are in good hands, and a sum sufficient to
virtually guarantee the success of the movement has
been subscribed. Every feature of the patriotic un
dertaking gives assurance therefore to the public that
money contributed to the fund will be promptly ap
plied to the purpose for which it was donated. There
is not to be any of that long delay that wears out
popular interest in public enterprises. If the con
tributions are given in as promptly as they should be
the erection of the monument will be a matter of the
immediate future.
The plan suggested by prominent Irishmen in New
York for the purchase of the Lakes of Killarney and
contiguous country for an Irish national park appeals
to more than members of that race. The Lakes of
Killarney are more than Irish. They are poetry's gift
to an entire world.
Judging from the cable dispatches. Tod Sloan is by
long odds the most important personage in Europe,
and if K-iiser William do not get him a new uniform
or make another war lord speech very soon people
will forget he lives op that continent.

the rank-* of the benefactors of mankind. He an
nounce- that he will soon introduce to the public a
biace of deaf and dumb prize-fighters.
The world will not weep at the fate that overtook

FAIR PLAY FOR THE NEW CHARTER.
I"*HE CALL vigorously and consistently opposed
the adoption of the new charter. It was under
discussion for months, not merely in respect to
: the plan of municipal government upon which it was
based, but also in its segregated features and in its de
tails. The opposition of The Call was pressed upon
grounds of policy, and, in some particulars, for con
stitutional reasons, and was supported by a multi
plicity of facts and by strong and consistent argu
ment.
The Freeholders, by whom the new charter was
I framed, were carefully selected, embraced many repre
sentative and intelligent citizens, among whom able
lawyers were included, and as a body they were ob
viously devoted to the public good. They deliberated
for months, and received and considered numerous
suggestions from official and unofficial sources. When
cnmpleted the instrument embodied their settled con
clusions, reached without undue liaste and as the re
sult of earnest and protracted labor.
The new charter was most exhaustively considered
by the community in every phase in which it could bo
presented, and with unusual acumen and intelligence.
Members of the Board of Freeholders made numer
ous public speeches and wrote many communications
in its favor. Its opponents were equally energetic
and thorough. The publications on both sides of
the controversy were exhaustive and were widely cir
culated. After all this preliminary debate, at a spe
cial election, where there was no other question to
distrart public attention, it was adopted by a majority
of 2364, out of a total vote of 26,969. It was also
unanimously ratified at the last session of the Legis
lature.
We live under representative institutions, and when,
after dispassionate and mature investigation, in con
formity with the constitution and the statutes, the
new charter was thus enacted into law it became and
it is the duty of every American citizen to acquiesce,
to the extent at least that the new scheme of local
government is consistent with the Federal and State
constitutions. This is the present attitude of The
Call. It is proper and essential that, at the right time
and without unnecessary delay, constitutional ques
tions arising under various provisions of the instru
ment should be raised and determined. Rut it is not
proper and it is not essential that the railroad
monopoly should be facilitated in raids, which have
no relation to any conceivable public service, and are
designed solely to relieve the Southern Pacific Com
pany and the Market Street Railway Company from
limitations upon franchises and from other practical
conditions that are manifestly legal and just in them
stlves and that stand in the way of such wholesale
robbery as was recently attempted through corrupt
members of the Board of Supervisors. The people
are entitled to the benefit of every clause by which
I their rights are protected, and all patriotic citizens
and independent taxpayers will rejoice if it should
turn out that at last a check has been effectively in
terposed to the commission of acts under nionopo- j
listic direction that but for the fixed locality of the
public streets would combine every element of lar- ]
ceny.
For municipal officers to attack the new charter,
whether at the suggestion of the railroad or purely on
their own account, in order to prolong their terms, is I
I indecent and not susceptible even of palliation. These
gentlemen accepted their nominations and conducted
! their canvass with the distinct understanding that, if J
elected, they were to serve for one year. Every vote !
cast for them rested upon this proposition. They hold
their offices by popular indorsement for the circum
scribed period. They are actually pledged to support j
the charter and to vacate their positions when new
officers are chosen, unless they should exhibit such
1 efficiency and integrity as to become their own sue- j
J cessors. They have no right as an afterthought and
' through technicalities, if they exist, to enforce upon
the community, without its consent and against its will, \
new contracts for extended service. There are some
of the present incumbents of whom The Call does not
believe that they would voluntarily act as catspaws for
the railroad, and yet that is the exact attitude into
which it is proposed to seduce them.
The Call has no apology to make for its antagon
ism to the new charter. It has no desire to interpose
obstacles to a fair and prompt test of any of its
features that can be plausibly attacked upon consti
tutional grounds. But it insists that the instrument
shall have fair play and that its full operation shall
not be impeded by corrupt railroad designs, in the
! interests of local or State monopoly, or for the un
<â  juit prolongation of official terms.
THE PORTO RICAN PUZZLE.
THE statement made on Saturday by the Com
missioners from Porto Rico lets some light on
the situation in that island. They represent
industry and trade suspended, the people generally in
want land many starving. These hard fates are upon
them because they are practically isolated. Their
I government by the United States army is complained
lof as oppressive and distasteful. Their former advan
j tagcous commerce with Spain is cut off by the trans
! fer of the island to the United States, while the tariff
of this country shuts them off from trade here. In
their hunger and distress they have made the unhappy
discovery that trade has not followed the flag. The
imagination of our people has been somewhat inflamed
Iby the usual tale of "immeasurable wealth" in the
i island. The fact is that, like most tropical countries,
it is poor. It produces the perishable fruits of the
torrid zone, but is incapable of exploitation agricul
turally in the sense in which temperate zone lands can
jbe used. The physiography of the island is well
I known. It is largely mountainous, with but tew
j plains, and these limited in area. Its former noble
forests have mostly disappeared. Its many mountains
j streams are torrential in consequence. The soil is so
j soaked by the almost perpetual rainfall that unless
j 1 ' rses are provided with broad platforms to stand on
their hoofs speedily rot off. The whole island is
infected with tuberculosis, due possibly to the humid
iity. and perhaps planted originally by invalid pil
grims, ill with the disease, who mistakenly sought it as
a sanitary retreat because it was tropical. Once planted
there the disease has flourished in its damp environ
ment until not many are free from it, and, in view of
its infectious and communicable nature, it presents an
additional peri! to North Americans who may attempt
jto sojourn there. The zymotic diseases also abound
i at all seasons.
The physical features of the island fit it only for
the kind of people who are there now. The popula
tion is noisomely dense, 230 to the square mile.
There is no room for any more. In spite of the raoid
THE SA!N FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JUNE 7. 1899.
growth of certain tropical products, the people are
usually in squalor, and famine-smitten. As the whole
area of the island equally apportioned would give
each only two acres and a fraction, if it were all
arable, life would be maintained only by a struggle.
But so much of it is rough and mountainous that the
arable land is less than one acre per capita. Much of
it is tilled under very great difficulties. The steep
slopes to which the people have been compelled to
resort in order to live are so hard to cling to that
during many generations bred upon them the people
who live on them have developed a peculiarly formed
foot and other physical changes 'due to clinging to
their little patches on the mountain side. Ninety-five
per cent of the people are totally illiterate.
The island has no coal, iron or other minerals of
any consequence, and its manufacturing possibilities
are limited.
When its government is arranged for and its
products are admitted free to our ports they will com
pete with that which we produce at home. The
principal exports are tobacco, of a grade about equal
to our North Carolina leaf, sugar, and such fruits as
oranges, bananas and limes. The orange export will
be quite formidable, and will be felt by the Califor
nia citrus orchardists.
THE KILLIN OF SEA LIONS.
AN order from Washington suspending the
authority given to kill sea lions along this
coast is by no means creditable to the officials
at the capital. It argues an absence of anything like
a clear knowledge of the subject and implies a will
ingness on the part of the officials to comply with
whatever is desired by the last parties who have the
privilege of addressing them. On representations
from California authority to kill sea lions was granted,
but before the killing had well begun certain Eastern
sentimentalists object and the authority is recalled.
The subject has been thoroughly discussed on this
coast. All classes of persons having any kind of ex
pert knowledge of the matter, from fishermen to
scientists, have taken part in the debate, and every
feature of the problem has been well considered. The
conclusion has been that the existence of such large
herds of sea lions off the coast has been prejudicial
to our fisheries, and that the general good demands
a diminution in the number of the herd. It was
therefore upon good and sufficient reasons that the
authority to kill them was granted, and, that being
so, it is not easy to see how there can be any reason
whatever for revoking the authority so speedily.
At the present time the Government is expending
a good deal of money to increase the salmon supply
of our waters and to protect the fisheries from in
jury. The Federal officials have been actively aided
in the work by the State Commission, and their joint
labors have resulted in much good. While the com
missions are working to protect the fish, the sea
lions are destroying them by thousands. To prevent
any check upon the unlimited increase of the number
of sea lions is therefore about as absurd as it would be
to protect wolves in a community where we are try
ing to develop a sheep-raising industry.
It is gratifying to know that a prompt protest
against the order of suspension has been forwarded
to Washington calling the attention of the Secretary
cf the Treasury to the facts that a large expense has
been entailed in fitting out the expeditions against
the sea lions, with the permission of the Government.
Also that the movement against these sea animals
has received the indorsement and approval of the
commercial and scientific men of the coast. And,
further, that the State and the United States are
spending thousands of dollars every year to foster and
build up the salmon industry, into which the sea rob
bers are making such disastrous inroads.
With such facts before him. the Secretary can
hardly fail to give the subject a reconsideration. The
sea lion is distinctly a local problem, and the solution
of it can be safely left to our authorities.
THE CANADIAN CONTROVERSY.
ACCORDING to a dispatch from Washington of
yesterday, Secretary Hay has taken steps
toward arranging a temporary agreement with
Great Britain regarding the Alaskan boundary dis
pute, so as to prevent any conflict of authority along
the line while the subject remains a matter of con-
trovers}-.
Such an agreement is in every way desirable, since
it seems likely the dispute will go on for years to
come. Were any ftther nations engaged in such a dis
putation over an important boundary line there would
be imminent danger of a war. In the present case,
however, there is not even a suspicion of such a dan
ger. The Canadians, indeed, seem to be very much
j irritated over the subject, but even among them the
irritation is mainly felt in the neighborhood of Vic
toria. We may be sure the people of Ontario and
Quebec have no desire. to start a fight with the United
| States for the sake of upholding a claim to an Alaskan
harbor.
Despite all that has been written about the subject,
the exact status of the controversy is not known ex
cept to the Joint High Commission and to the offi
cial dignitaries at Washington and London, to whom
the commission reports. That much is made evi
dent by the conflicting nature of the rumors started
sometimes in this country and sometimes in Canada.
At one time it is announced that Canada will not
agree to a settlement of any of the questions before
the commission unless her claim to Pyramid Harbor
and a large part of the Alaskan panhandle is granted.
I At another time it is said Great Britain will force the
Canadians to accept any terms which the imperial
Government arranges with the United States. A
| third report follows to the effect that the British
authorities are despondent, while the Canadians are
aggressive. And now comes the announcement of a
scheme for a temporary settlement.
In the end the iÂ£sue will doubtless be submitted to !
i arbitration. Our representatives at the Peace Con- j
I ference have united with those of Great Britain in
! urging the conference to recommend the adoption of
I arbitration as a means of preventing wars, and both
j Governments are therefore more or less bound to ',
j follow that course in the present instance. Canada
will hardly be permitted to permanently block the |
i effort of the two nations to reach a satisfactory basis
OD which to submit the case, but some Victoria papers i
are talking as if they thought Canada can whip Great j
Britain and the United States put together. Thus, for"!
1 example, the Victoria Globe recently stated as a warn- j
j ing to the British Ministry: "Canadians will not
peaceably submit to further humiliation from the |
United States, and the sooner the Government recog- '
nizes the fact and acts accordingly the better it will ''
be for the country."
It will be seen that, however indifferent we may be
to the question, it is a very lively one for our neigh
bors. Fortunately, while Canada can make a good
I deal of noise, she cannot do much damage, and the ;
| temporary settlement now being arranged will be fol- I
lowed in due time by a permanent one without a fight
or even serious friction to any one except the jingoes
j of Victoria.

CALIFORNIA
CANNOT ARRIVE
BY THE FOURTH
Regiment Has Not as
Yet Left Manila.
SUCH ARE THE INDICATIONS
THE SECOND OREGON REPORTED
TO HAVE SAILED FOR HOME.
Five Soldiers Buried at the Presidio
Yesterday â Large Assignment
of the Casuals Made to Dif
ferent Commands.
In the past few days the idea has
gained general prevalence that San Fran
cisco will have the First California Regi
ment home in time to participate in the
celebration of the Fourth of July. From
the present outlook such is not the case.
No news was received at department
headquarters yesterday to indicate that
the First had yet left Manila. If they
have not left as yet, the regiment can
not arrive here in time to join in the
'festivities of the Fourth. Colonel Long,
the depot quartermaster, is notified of
the departure of every vessel from Ma
nila, and up to yesterday he had received
no notification of the departure of any
vessel upon which the regiment could
have sailed. The last transport that left
Manila was the Conemaugh, -^hich sailed
on May 17, but Colonel Long does nnt
know what this vessel had aboard. It
was reported around headquarters yester
day that the Second Oregon had left Ma
nila, but this could not be confirmed. If
such is the case and the First had not
left, then the War Department has
changed its programme of returning the
volunteers in the order in which they
wf-nt. The First California was the first
of any volunteer regiments to go aboard
a transport for Manila.
Then' we're live soldiers buried at the
Presidio yesterday. The remains of Ar
thur Jobbing, Company H. Eighteenth
Infantry; James Healy. Company I, Eight
eentta Infantry; William D. Griffin, Bat
tery G, Sixth Artillery, and Walter J. Mc-
Li an, Company L, First Montana, which
were brought from Manila on the Zea
landia, were taken to the Presidio on
the steamer McDowell and interred in
the cemetery there. Claude W. Payne of
the Engineer Corps, Who died of con
sumption at the general hospital, was
the fifth soldier buried yesterday. The re
mains of the other soldiers which were
brought up on the Zealandia were sent
East.
The War Department has not yet de
cided upon the retention of the City of
Puebla and the Zealandia as transports.
Colonel Long received no word yester
day in regard to them, but it is generally
thought that they will be held by the
Government, especially the former. Just
at present transports are being needed,
and it will take very little time to put
the necessary repairs upon these two
vessels.
General Shafter has issued an order
distributing 4W soldiers of the casual de
tachment among the following com
mands: Fourth Cavalry, 125 men; Third
Artillery, 25 men; Sixth Artillery, 6 men;
Fourteenth Infantry, GO men; Eighteenth
Infantry, 50 men; Twentieth Infantry, 50
men; Twenty-second Infantry. 50 men,
and the Twenty-third Infantry, 100 men.
Major Henry R. Krinkerhoff, Third In
fantry, has been ordered to take charge
(if the recruiting station in this city, re
lieving Captain Robert H. R. Loughbor
ough, Twenty-fifth Infantry.
Major J. M. Thompson, Twenty-fourth
Infantry, has been relieved from the tem
porary command of Alcatraz Island and
ordered to report to the commanding offi
cer of the Presidio for duty at that post.
During the temporary absence of Ma
jor Edward Field, Third Artillery. Cap
tain Robert H. Noble, Third Infantry,
has been detailed to take charge of the
offices of the inspector general and artil
lery Inspector of the department. *

TOWNSEND'S
TALE OF WOE
IS GRIEVOUS
Sues His Wife for a
Divorce.
CRUELTY IS THE CHARGE
THREATS OF MURDER CITED
BY PLAINTIFF.
When He Was 111 His Stepchildren
Amused Themselves Throwing
Boxes, While a Nephew
Played the Piano.
If the various allegations of William S.
Tcwnsend, the candy man of note, are
based on fact, he committed a grievous
error when he married his present wife
and took into his home her four children
by a former husband. Suit has been tiled
in th# Superior Court by Mr. Townsend for
divorce from his wife on the ground of
cruelty, mentally inflicted, and several
specific charges are set forth, which from
the complaint it is obvious the plaintiff
believes to have been well pr#]
schemes to deprive rum of his constitu
tional right to be happy.
In Introduction of his complaint, Mr.
Townsend alleges that he married his
wife, Olivia K. Townsend, October 15, 1895,
and took into his home her four children.
Since that time she has been cruel to a
marked degree, her must common mode
of punishment, however, being to hurl
opprobrious epithets at plaintiff to his
grievous mental suffering.
Continuing, the plaintiff says that of late
he has been in poor health, and after re
turning from his factory would try to rest.
While so trying to rest in his room, his
fcur stepchildren would appear- upon the
scene, and they would throw boxes and
other objects at the ceiling for hours at a
time, causing Mr. Townsend great m
suffering. After the children had tired
of their box and other object throwing
match, a nephew of Mrs. Townsend would
take up the labor of annoying the plain
tiff and for hours would play the piano.
Requested to desist, he and Mrs. Town
send would retreat to the garret over Mr.
Townsend's room and amuse themselves
throwing boxes and other objects around,
which made a gr?at and unbearable
noise, "all of which arts contributed to
the grievous mental suffering of the
plaintiff."
Again Mrs. Townsend would charge her
husband with Infidelity without cause, it
is alleged, and charged him with consort-
Ing with "chippies who labored in his
factory. Again she would threat*
kill him, suggesting aoison as the means
of murder, in consequence of which Mr.
TowTisend says that further residence
with his wife is dangerous to his life and
would add to his already grievous mentifl
suffering.
Mrs. Townsend has a sister in East
Oakland, plaintiff further alleges, with
whom his wife is wont to visit for weeks
at a time, never coming near him to gi\~t
him the care he needs to his failing
health. Mrs. Townsend, plaintiff says, Is
constantly harassing him for money for
herself and relatives, and threatens, in
event he does not produce all she desires,
to pawn her jewels and use Mr. Town
send's credit for her needs. The evil in
fluence of the sister if- in a measure re
sronsible for the trouble, it is alleged, but
Mrs. Townsend threa*ens to kill the plain
tiff if he makes an attempt to evict her
and other relatives who call and con
tribute schemes to add to his woe. All in
all, if the allegations are based on fact,
Mr Townsend, when at home, is bet wen
the influence of his Satanic Majesty arid
the deep sea, and hence he seeks re
lief in never ending separation.

POLICE COURT
CLERKS ARE TO
BE DISCIPLINED
Must Comply Strictly
With the Law.
ARE
GIVEN TIMELY WARNING
DISMISSAL THE PENALTY FOB
DISOBEDIENCE.
At Its Meeting Next Monday the
Board of Supervisors Will Issue
a Formal Notifi
cation.
The strong hand of the B< ard nf Super
visors Is to be laid on the clerks of tha
Police Courts in the for ;mely
warning that unless they perform their
duties as required by la- L be
dismissed from the employ the city.
This action was decided o y at
a meeting of the Judiciary I ommluee of
the Board of Supervisors, and at the next
regular meeting- of the board there will
be adopted a resolution formally : tting
forth the warning and the penalty for dis
obedience.
The action taken yesterday grows out
of the recommendation made by the
Grand Jury at the time it indicted Police
Court Clerk Kelly for complicity in the
Issuance of straw bonds. Attention was
called to the fact that the clerks are not
in attendance at their respective court
rooms during the hours required by law
and that they have made a practice of
establishing headquarters at different
places about town, where they accept
questionable or worthless bonds upon the
payment to them of a consideration in
The law governing the conduct of clerks
of the Police Courts requires that they
"shall be in attendance at their respective
courtrooms or offices attached thereto
from 'j o'clock a. m. until 4 o'clock p. m.
every day in the week, Sundays and holi
days excepted, to perform the duties im
posed as required by law. The clerks
of the Police Courts shall also alternate
so that one clerk In turn shall be in at
tendance at the courtroom or office at
tached thereto every evening in tne week
from 7:30 to 10 o'clock, and on Sundays
and holidays from 1Â« o'clock a. m. until
t o'clock p. m., for the purpose of taking
bail bonds, when the sufficiency and quah
fication of the sureties are examined into
proved. The clerks of Police Courts
shall not accept sureties on bail bonds
except within the places and within the
time prescribed by this section."
Th^ provisions of this law have never
complied with by the Police Court
clerks for the very good reason that its
observance would prevent them from ae
manding pay for the acceptance of bail
bonds at all times when they are not in
their offices. The occasions when a Police
Court clerk can be found in the City Hall
after the noon hour are extremely rare,
and they are never to be found there at
night As a consequence, persons who
are placed under arrest are put to an
infinite amount of trouble and unneces
sary delay and expense in searching ror
some one who is competent to accept a
bond and when a clerk is found in some
resort downtown the payment of a fee
is demanded as a condition for the issu
ance of the desired release.
This condition of things is now to be
changed. Unless the clerks comply with
the law in this and all other matters com
plained of their refusal to do so will be
considered as just cause for their Im
mediate discharge from the employ of the
city The resolution to be recommended
for 'passage at the next meeting of the
Board of "Supervisors will put an .end l to
what has fur years been a disgraceful
evasion of the law and a prolific source of
criminality.
BEHIND IN HIS WORK.
Meredith Left the Chinese Bureau in
a Very Unsatisfactory Condition.
When 15. E. Meredith left the Chinese
Bureau at the request of the Secretary
of the Treasury, he was away behind in
his work for reasons which have not yet
developed, and he left to his temporary
successor, Chief Fle3h, an heirloom of
unfinished business which has not even
vÂ»-t been disposed of. Consequently, when
Chief Dunn entered upon the discharge of
his dutii s he found the business of the
office a last year's birdnest. and in order
to catch up with the work, which was
accumulating at a rapid rate. Collector
Jackson appointed William Gassaway and
John R. Dunn as assistants to the Chinese
Inspectors in the bureau, temporarily.
Two interpreters were added also. Carl

with Dr Gardiner, three interpreters.
Assistant Dunn is a son of Chief Dunn,

Daverkosen's unfortunate crime
causes him more pain than the sud
den access of wealth is capable of
giving him joy. In a well-worn wallet
which never leaves his person are the
various newspaper clippings that tell
of his crime. Over these the unfortu
nate man pores daily, and he never
folds them away without tearfully
muttering: "I deserve it all! The
guilty must be punished. 1 had no
right, though I was starving, to steal."
In telling the story of his petty
crime Daveikusen seems not to shield
himself. "1 was hungry," he said,
"and 1 stole to get food. Food for my
self; not my wife and children. The
crime is mine and the cause is mine,
mine alone."
On the 17th of last January Daver
kosen, who was gaining a precarious
existence as a painter, traveling
around the country towns and doing
odd jobs at ridiculously low wages,
found himself alone in this city and
penniless. In his travels he had
earned some $60, which he had sent in
several remittances to Iris wife, who
was living with her three little ones
in WatsonvlUe. Daverkosen. in his
desire that his loved ones know noth
ing of the many hardships he was
enduring ur.d in consideration of the
joyous Christmasiidt . sent nearly all
his savings to his family.
Days w-t-nt by and though he eagerly
sought for work, work was not to be
found. Then he met a man who told
him of "the open poor box at St. Jo
seph's Church." "There is always
money in that box," said the man.
TO RECORD HISTORY

Santiago de
Cuba.
A HANDSOMELY bound copy I
of the constitution and by- I
laws of the Society of the I
Army of Santiago dc Cuba. I
with a historical sketch of the I
same, was received from Washington I
yesterday by General Shafter. Th!s I
society, which has a most interesting I
history, is the outgrowth of the late I
war, and it is destined to take Its I
place with the Loyal Legion and other I
Similar army organizations. It was I
organized July 31. 1898, in the Govern- I
or's palace in Santiago. The badge of I
the .society in exceedingly handsome I
and effective in its design. It repre- I
sents the American eagle pr-rchf-ri upon I
the top of a Maltese cross. The bird
has his wings outstretched and is I
holding in hip claws a broken chain to I
indicate that Cuba's bonds of servi- I
tude have been broken. The circular intenoror^meeroF^eoniains^WelMfS

Around this is the name of xh>' society with the date of its organization.
The Whole is suspended by i,. nbben of Spanish colors, while the badge
proper is done In gold and green enamel.
The organization of this society is to commemorate the deeds of the
American army in Cuba. It had been considered before the expedition
sailed for Cuba, and was discussed in the camps at Tampa and on board the
transports during the voyage. Tt wns not. however, until after the fierce
battles of July, culminatimr in 'hr> surrender of Santiago, that the matter
took definite shape. General Shafter having approved of the organization cf
the society. General Lawton addressed a letter to the several division and
subordinate commanders, asking them to meet for a discussion of the matter.
In answer to General Lawton's letter seventy-five officers met in the Govern
or's palace on July 31 and the society was organised.
The following officers were elected to serve for one year: President. Major
General W. R. Shafter; first vice president. Major General Joseph Wheeler;
Pecond vice president. Major General J. Ford Kent; third vice president. Ma
jor General H. W. Lawton; fourth vice president. Major General John C.
Bates; secretary and treasurer. Major Alfred C. Sharpe; historian. Major G.
Crelghton Webb; registrar general. Major Philip Reade; first division regis
trar. Captain L. W. V. Kennon; second division registrar. Captain James T.
Kerr; third division registrar. Captain Charles Morton; and fourth division
registrar. Lieutenant Colonel John Jacob Astor.
The following officers were elected members of council of the society:
Major Generals S. B. M. Young. H. S. Hawkins, A. R. Chaffee, William Lud
low and S. S. Sumner: Rrigadier Generals Albert Ames, Wallace F. Ran
dolph and Chambers McKibbln; Colonel Theodore Roosevelt and Lieutenant
Colonel John D. Mlley.
According to the constitution the purpose of the organization is to record
the history and conserve the memory of the events of the campaign which re
sulted in the surrender on the 17th day of July. 1898, of the Spanish army, the
City of Santiago de Cuba and the military province to which it pertained. All
officers and soldiers of the United States army, including acting assistant
surgeons and authorized volunteer aids, who constituted the expeditionary
force to Santiago de Cuba, and who worthily participated in the campaign be
tween the dates of June 14 and July 17. are eligible for membership in the so
ciety. The fiscal year of the society begins September 15, upon which day
its constitution was formally adopted. No entrance fee 1b required, and the
dues are $1 a year.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JUNE 7, 1899.
"I'm hungry," said Daverkosen.
"11l take it."
For weeks previous St. Joseph's poor
box was being systematically pilfered,
and traps were laid for the capture of
the thief. The "man" led Davcrkos-n
into the trap. The box was open and
there \v:is ::â¢< cento in it. The hungry
man put out his hand fnr the coins
all markedâ and John Mclnerney. the
sexton, pounced upon him .md handed
him over to the stern hand of the law.
For this offense Daverkosen was
sentenced to six months' imprison
ment in the County Jail. On account
of his eagerness and willingness to
work the prisoner has never been con
fined in a cell, but has utilized his
tradeâ painterâ for the Improvement of
the prison.
Immediately upon his release from
jail H is the prisoner's intention to
leave for Holland. "First to Holland.
to get possession of my money, and
then Germany, all over Germany," he
said. "My wife is in Germany. I want
to rind hÂ«*r and beg her to forget, to
forgive and to return to me."
Daverkosen is a native of Holland,
but was educated in Germany. When
the Franco-Prussian war was declared
he was a lieutenant in Holland's army,
but went over to Germany, offered
his services and was appointed a staff
officer under Yon Moltke.
Besides the wealth that comes to
him from the old country it is said
that the man who tried to take 30
< i :it r- from the poor box of a church
will upon the death of his stepmother,
who lives in the immediate vicinity of
this city, inherit something like
$300,000. When asked why he did not
appeal to his relatives when in dis
tress Davorkosen replied "I was too
proud."

for trying to end her husband's life with

to show little concern over her action,
she could not repress the tears that
welled up in her eyes when she narrated
the cruel treatment accorded her by the
man who is in law her husband, but who
pf-rsists in telling people that the un
fortunate woman who bears his name is
not his wife.
| James M. McCarthy was driven hurried
ly to the Receiving Hospital, suffering
from a terrible push in the back of his
neck, which be 'asserts was inflicted by hi 3
wife. Numerous stiti hea were necessary
t' close Up the gaping wound, and Dr.
Tormey, the physician or. duty, said that
had the razor wielder been a trifle surer
in her stroke, stitches would have been
unnecessary, as the wounded man would
have succumbed before- reaching the hos
pital. McCarthy refused to speak about
the affair, not because he might do his
wife an injustice, but because he might
lose his position. Officer Harry O'Day.
who arrested ihe woman, subpened the
injured man, but it is unlikely that he will
put in an appearance in court this morn
ing, as he lias no desire to prosecute his
better half.
"He dare not prosecute me." his wife
vehemently said, when giving her reasons
for attempting the life of her husband.
"I'll have him arrested, the brute, for
ill-treating me. and he will get the worst
of It. Why. last night he came home un
der the Influence, of liquor, and because I
paid something to him he caught my head
uiÂ«der bia arm and nearly choked me. He
caused me so much pain that when I got
up this morning 1 could hardly move my
neck."
To prove this statement, the prisoner
Showed the marks on her neck. She also
said her husband was an artesian well
borer, and was extremely powerful. Hi 3
appearance bore out the latu-r statement.
"He has beat mo." she continued,
"starved me. said vile things about nu-.
until I had no otiier recourse than to
either kill him or myself. He has been
going around with other women, and has
even flaunted it in my face. Why. lust

"I found a razor sticking out of his

WHEN HOPE
! â¢ HAS FLED
Life Becomes a Burden That
Many Cannot Bear:
NO MAN KNOWS THE TORTURES OF DE-
spondency unless they have experienced that
molt deplorable condition of the human mind.
A man without hope is at the mercy of the de-
mon of insanity and may at any time become a
victim of the suicidal mania. Any man, young
or old, married or single, who is afflicted with
a weakness or a disease cannot possibly feel
that buoyancy which is necessary to success
and happiness. DR. MEYERS & CO. have long
been noted for giving to debilitated men new
hope, new life, new courage and new ambi-
tions. If you are not as strong and as well
as you should be consult these great specialists.

Ben Fisher's Luck.
Ben Fisher, an experienced miner, well
known in Plymouth, Amador County, Bo
die, Mono County. California; Virginia
City and Silver City, Nevada, writes to
his brother-in-law in Alameda that he
struck a very promising quartz ledge
sixty miles east from Circle City, which
Is from 5 to 7 feet wide, runs north and
south, and tips east in a slate formation.
It prospects $122 of free gold to the. ton,
and is rich in sulphurets. The ledge
runs through the richest gravel mines of
the Circle City mining district.
Withstood a Fearful Shock.
Suit was filed yesterday against the
General Electric Company by Edward J.
Crawford, who seeks to recover $11 .WK)
damages for personal injuries. He al
leges that while employed in the South
ern California Power Company's works in
Santa Ana Canyon, which were then un
der the charge of the defendant corpora
tion, owing to the negligence of the com
pany's agents and employes he was
thrown in contact with a live wire which
registered 18,000 volts. The current en
tered his head and burned out through
his heels, he alleges, injuring him for life.

The way women trifle with health
shows a degree of indifference that is
past understanding. Happiness and use-
fulness depend on physical health ; so
does a good disposition. Disease makes
vomen nervous, irritable and snap-
pish. The very effort of ailing women
to be good-natured makes them ner-
vous. Write to Mrs. Pinkham, she will
help you to health and happiness.
It costs nothing to get Mrs. Pinkham's
advice. Her address is Lynn, Mass.

DRIED FRUITS IN NEW YORK.
The Nfw York Commercial pays:
"The situation in prunes is unchanged.
Holders of spot stocks are firm in their views
nnd refuse to make concessions of importance
e\crpt uoon lots out of storage, which it is
rot deemed profitable to hold for high prices.
I/ate reports from the coast are to the effect
that this year's crop will be up to the average
In most localities, but here and there the yield
promises less than last year. Almost none are
left in first hands In California, and supplies
in second hands ore much reduced. Jobbers
here have all they care for at present and
there is little further demand probable.
"Raisins are quiet. There are occasional car
pales, but in the main sales are of small lots
fcr presont consumption. . Prices are steady.
Particulars of the recent sales have not been
made public, but according to the best infor
mation available the ;irice realised was close
up io market quotations. Foreign goods are
flat. No sales of importance have occurred re
< ently find buyer? refuse to make any bids
fnr gon.if at present.
"Peaches are quiet. Little trading Is done in
rid g.â¢.ls nd cpentng prices on new have not
boon made though dealers expect the an
ii-.unr-pment every day. The crop shortage
over practically the entire country has a
tendency to keep the market firm, even under
light offerings. It Is thought that opening
jirjrcs will be higher this year than ever be
forr-. . '
"Apricots are firm. There are but few In
market of the old stocks and opening prices
tn new grvods have not been made. The trade
is uncertain as to the future, but there ap
pears to be a well-grounded impression that
prices will he higher than last year."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NETV YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, .TunÂ» 6â Business was r>n far \
too small a scale on the Stock Exchange to
day to warrant any well defined conclusion as
to the general temper of speculation or a Just
reflection' of business and financial conditions. !
But there was a very notable hardening of I
values in railroad securities, which was fol- I
lowed up as the day's business progressed by !
a rise in prices which embraced pretty much '
every railroad stock dealt m. This Strength i
started buying In Louisville, which was Â«>Â»Â«
--dentlj bought for London account. The bid
ding up of the price In this stock In the course
of executing buying orders imparted strength
to the whole group. Southern Railway pre
ferred and .Norfolk and Western preferred being '
the first to respond and the Grangers, Pacifies :
â¢ sterns ani even s .me of the trunk lines
following this lead. Pennsylvania and Pitts- I
burg. Chicago. Cincinnati. Cleveland and St
Louis rose from 1% to s> . the latter stock, how
ever !oÂ«!nr all but 1H of the advance. The
motive assigned by the buyers was the possi
bility that a more liberal policy toward stock
holders and less Insistence upon reinvestment I
or resources In equipment mleht follow the
change in administration made necessary by ;
1 resident Thompson's death. But the trading
for the most part was profoundly apathetic
and ere were minutes at a time when no tape
rame from the ticker. The action of profes
sional traders was all centered In Sugar and
the Utterly erratic movements of this stock were '
due to the enure uncertainty regarding to-mor- I
row s clvidend action. Advocates of the regu
lar dividend and of a reduction seemed equally
confident and equally numerous, so that the 'â 
ftock dipped below last night's level and re
bounded far above it. The extreme ran was
4-, points and the close was at a net gain of
1\ and within half of the top.
An ir.cldent of the trading to-day was some
targe wagers on the one hand that- to-morrow's
Mipar dividend declaration would be at the
regular rate and offers on the other hand to
sell ,'â  â â  dividend on large amounts of stocks
lor less tlian the regular rate. The same dis
trustful attitude is maintained toward the iron
and steel Mocks, notwithstanding semi official
intimation a* to! the rate of coming dividend
declarations and Informal assurances that cur
rent earnings are far in excess of the proposed
dividend disbursement. Even the preferred
stocks of industrials, however regular may
have been their dividend records, continue far
below the prices of ordinary dividend-paying
railroad stocks which made the name, returns 011
money Invested. This distrust of Industrials
teems to be the most important element in the '
present dullness and heaviness or the- market'
A further small shipment of gold to-day was
as wholly without Influence in the stock market '
as well as In the foreign exchange market as I
those that have preceded It from the same in- !
Mltution. The conviction Is general that tne
outflow is the result of special conditions and
no longer an exchange situation.
The bond market was dull and generally firm i
though there were a few yielding spot! " Total '
eales. par value/ $2,210,000. United States old

CHICAGO' GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. June 6.â Wheat at the opening
still showed the weakness that characterized
the market late yesterday. Much wheat was
i offered on account of the. favorable crop condi
tions prevailing and in addition early news was
! all against prices. The result was an open- ;
I ing decline In July of from %Â®%c, July start
! ing at 76VtÂ®76%c. This was (.lose to "put"
1 price and buying against those privileges
, caused a temDorary reaction to 76% c. That
demand satisfied, the market again declined) |
and for the remainder of the session was de- !
cidedly weak. Liverpool cables showed l%d '
decline. During the afternoon liquidation, 1
which had been steady from the start, became
very heavy. July at one time showed 2c d.
dine, but recovered slightly at the close. July
opened at 76 1 : V, advanced to 76% c, de
clined to 74% c and closed at 75c.
1 Corn was remarkably firm considering the j
â  weakness of wheat. It showed some weakness
i at the start, partly from the favorable weather
i and large receipts, but at the decline there
I whs a good demand from shorts. The market
closed steady at V4Â®Vic decline.
. Oats held fairly steady on a small amount of
trading. July left off a shade lower.
Provisions were very quiet but firm. ling
receipts were light and yard prices higher.
Packers were moderate sellers, but all offer-
Ings were absorbed by shorts. At the close
July pork was 2%Â®5c higher a.nd lard and ribs
each Cc higher.

with suicidal intent, although Dr. L. F.

A f>w "lays ago Mrs. Laferme received

mother's .serious illness. This sad news
POSTUM CEREAL.
WOULDN'T BE PUT OFF.
Went to the Kitchen and Made It
Herself.
Husband said to me one morning,
"It seems to me,, my dear, that it will
pay you to make a trial and see wheth-
er it may not be true, as your physi-
cian says, that the cause of your per-
lia and head trouble and
palpitation of the heart is coffee."
]}â¢ said, "Suppose we stop coffee and
try thla Postum Food Coffee:" I
agreed to it, and so a package was
up that day.
j- the morning we had the new food
coffee, and after filling my husband's
cup I filled my own. I sipped a few
sful, and I am ashamed to say
thai my eyw filled, too. I could not
drink it.
Husband suggested that inasmuch
as thla was tho first trial the cook had
not made it properly.
I took the coffee pot to the kitchen,
poured it out and examined the pack-
irefully, then followed directions
tly (an easy thing to do, by the
way) arid ;ifter I had got the coffee
iÂ»>t to boiling T left it in the cook's
charga, saying that I would send out
for it in fift'-en inin\it> s.
When it came in and I poured out
some fresh cups for husband and my-
self, what a revelation! 1 could not
have believed it possible that there
was such a difference between an ar-
ticle poorly prepared and properly pre-
]-m 1. Here it was, a black brown,
clear and delicious. The addition of a
little cream, turned It to that perfect
color that an epicure delights in.
This was several months ago, and I
attribute my gain in flesh and my per-
fect health to the use of Postum, as it
has served me as an ideal food. My
friends frequently say something like:
"I never saw you looking ho well.
What are you taking?" I reply: "I
a:u taking no medicine, but I am
drinking hard Just now, drinking iv.s-
tum Food Coffee," and the results are
very real indeed to husband and my-
self. Mra. Jennie Knight, Washlng-
t - D. C.
also added to her despondency, and this
morning Mr?. Laforme did not arise at
the usual hour. Inquiry at her room re-
Bulted in her declaration that she was
very HI. By noon her condition became
alarming, and her friends thronged about
her couch after summoning Dr. Herrick,
who Immediately gave the patient a hy
pod< rtnlc injection of morphine to relieve
her agony and pain from which she ap
peared to be Buffering. An hour later she
made th<' exclamation noted, and throw
ing back her head of luxuriant black hair
breathed her hist.
"Mrs. I.aferme gave us nn inkling that
she intended to commit suicide," said C.
A. Tyrrell, at whose home the dead
woman roomed. "She complained of be
ing sick this morning, and I could see she
was really sick, not In spirit at all, but
in body. 1 believe she has had a great
deal of trouble and worried considerably,
but 1 have my doubts that she took her
own life. Why. she expected to goto the ;
great exposition in Paris in 1900. She was
a most lovable little woman, and had
with us hardly a month. We have ;
conducted a thorough inspection through
out her room, but have been unable to
discover any trace of poison, and the
case is really mysterious."
I>r llerrick also is at a loss apparently
to determine the cause of death, and an
autopsy will be hHd to-morrow, when
, perhaps the true cause will be revealed.
"When T first examined Mrs. Laferme,"
said Dr. Herrick, "1 thought she was suf
fering from an exaggeration of hysteria
and I Injected s.>nv- morphine t" ease her, â 
but her condition did not seem to im- !
I cannot say that the symptoms ;
were those of poison, and am yet at a
â  v whether the woman com
mltted suicide."
Deceased was a petite brunette, aged
â  ars, and so far as known had j
! no relatives In this city.

CLERK LAMBORN DEFIES
THE CITY FATHERS
OBJECTS STRENUOUSLY TO A
PRESS CENSORSHIP.
The City Clerk Grilled for Throe
Hours for Giving Information
to Reporters.
1 AL.AMEDA, June The City Trustees
! attempted last night to establish a strict
press censorship on all municipal matters
that pass through the office of City Clerk
| Lamborn. That their plans miscarried is
due to no fault of theirs.
The City Clerk was grilled by the Trus
tees for three hours because he had not
hidden from the newspaper reporters
every official document that had been Bled
in his office since the new Board of Trus
tees took office. This board has been
making a record for star chamber meet
ings, but a little bird has reported all
their secret sessions and the public has
been informed of the proceeedings
through the papers as promptly as pos
sible.
Not being able to close the leak the
members undertook last night to make
an order forbidding the City Clerk m
open any official letters or allow th â  re
porters to inspect official document 3
until the board had looked them over in
executive session and decided whether or
not they were proper matters for the tax
payers "to know. -. . " Â«,
The resignation of J. 0. Messer, ex-en
gineer of the electric light works, was
printed in the papers while the Trustee*)
were giving out the statement that th..'
employes of the city light plant were as
happy as turtle doves and that th.- story
of Mesaer's resignation was a fairy tale.
Thut was one of the incidents that pre
cipitated the row last night.
After Chairman Brick had warmed up
to the situation he glared down upon the
City Clerk and in the angriest tones at
his command said:
"Sir, I want to know by what authority
you gave out to the newspapers that
Messer had resigned, and I want* to know
how they got a copy of his resignation
before I knew it was in existence. This
Bert of thing must stop right now," and
the chairman upset a pitcher of -water as
he pounded on his desk to emphasise his
marks. "Hereafter I alone will open
letters addressed to this board, and
nothing must be given out to the news
papers from your office In connection with
our business until we have first considered
it in executive session. Do you hear, sir?
These are my orders."
Trustee Alexander Mackie was also
against publicity in the management of
public affairs, for he agreed with Chair
man Brick. He wanted communications
addressed to the city dropped into a
sealed box, to be opened only In executive
sessions.
Mr Brick cooled off after he had his
say and gracefully admitted that the
City Clerk would be a pretty good fellow
ii he would not talk to the newspaper
reporters.
Mr, La inborn was not crushed by the
grilling, and when he was given an op
portunity to be heard he did not waste
words. He said:
"1 want it understood that the City
Clerk of Alameda has a mind of his own.
and is not afraid to speak It out. I have
dene nothing with the idea of satisfying
personal ends. Regarding my treatment
of the newspaper reporters, I insist that
every document that comes into my office
becomes public property as soon as it is
lilt.l and as such it is open to inspection,
and will continue to be. There has been so
much tomfoolery around this board that I
am naturally suspicious of everything
that is done. I want you to understand
that 1 am a free-born American citizen,
and always hope to enjoy the privilege of
free speech, and will not be muzzled."
The Trustees scolded until they grew
sleepy, when they adjourned and went
1 To-day City Attorney Taylor advised the
City Clerk that his course with regard to
public documents was correct. . â â â :

LOOTED TELEPHONE BOXES.
Samuel T>. Button, a young man of re
â pcetabla family, who has earned the
name of the "telephone-box flend." was
yesterday held to answer before the Su
perior Court by Judge Mogan on a charge
of burglary in $2000 bonds.
About six months ago Button was ar
rested and It was conceded that he had
robbed' forty-three telephone, boxes. Two
charges were preferred ngainst htm and
he was convicted on each by Judge Mo
gan. The Judge sentenced him to six
months on each charge, hut owing to the
plea of the telephone company and the
young man* parent! to be merciful the
Judge suspended sentence and allowed
him to go on probation for slk months.
A situation was procured for the young
man in a real estate office, but he was
discharged about six weeks ago. Almost
immediately afterward reports were re
ceived by the telephone company of boxes

again he tried for a place upon the
intercollegiate team which argued the
question of the retention of the Phil

conceded that an expert was at work

the telephone company and hooked on a
charge of burglary. !f successful in de

THE NEW PLAY
WITHOUT A TITLE
By Arthton Stevens.
Mr. Kelcey ;ind Mr. Shannon are ad
vertislng for a title where really they
should be advertising for a play. The
best title in the w.>r!d will not carry this
Dew and as yet unnamed comedy by Eva
r Klggs.. J tp Intention is daring and
clever, but Mrs. Kipps lacks the crafts
iip to carry out her idea.. Mrs.
EUggS lias a. p. id of a subject in the girl
who mistakes the man who loves her for
her long lout father, but Â»he is not comp
etent to handle it. She exhausts herself
and the plot in the first act After that
there Is no Invention, no enterprise â only
a series of obvious sequences.' Condensed
to the proportions of vaudeville. I can
imagine this piece a unique success, but
In its present form I can predict nothing
less than disaster for its producers.
Mrs. Kiggs' play, while avowedly one of
atmosphere rather than of action, ieals
in a subject that requires action. A great
deal of pretty deportment and sentiment
underlies h.-r writing, but nevertheless
her whole scheme is farce; and farce re
quires the deed to fit the word. She has,
with Horn.' sentimental embellishments
tr>-:tt'-d the subject from n purely farcical
standpoint. The only right standpoint:
for a serious, realistic working out of a
theme which revolves on the something
more than filial affection for the man
whom thÂ« woman has believed to be her
father would be nothing short of ibs^n at
his heaviest. Mrs. Riggs Is not an Ibsen
nor even an (bsenlte, so far as on<> may
judge by this piece, and she nas written
In i h.- purest Bplrit of fare?, relying on
tin- long arm of coincidence and a trust
ful public. And she has overdone the
trustful part "f it. There are no sur
prises. tin suspense, after the first act.
The piece is carried alongâ and then only
after a fashionâ by the excellent uctlng
that is lavished on it.
Beldom have i Been a bad play better
acted. That the atmosphere of the
South the play is Southern in its lo
caleâls not more poignant, is no fault of
the aeturs. They do much more than
their author has done for them. BJffie
Shannon i> simply delicious \h the South
ern heroine. On her shoulders falls the
most of the burden, and she carries i*
with delightful buoyancy and ingenuous
ness. Mr. Kelcey is not so well fitted In
the role of the lover who by circum-
Btances is compelled to pose as a parent,
but what any actor could do with the
part he does. In fact Hie entire cast Is
to b< praised, nnd the scenmg is admira
bleâbut the play! that is another story.
Miss Cotte's Success.
Miss Julia Cotte, the talented daughter
<>r s.ui Francisco, appeared last night for
the first time before an audience In her
native city as a professional singer. The
Grand Opera-house was well Oiled when
the curtain went up on the first act of
"The Pirntes of Penzance," In which
charming operetta the management of the
Southwell company bad chosen to pre
sent its new prima donna. Before Miss
Cotte made her entrance it was plain to
be seen that half the house was made up
of friends, mostly members of the French
colony, in which her parents have lone
been prominent figures. She had not been
five minutes on the scene when she had
captured in r hearers.
The tuneful melodies that fall to the lot
of the lovelorn Mabel In the operetta
perfectly fitted the voice of the debut
ante, who, thanks to careful training and
a previous experience with an Eastern
company, betrayed none of the methods
of trie novice. Jler petite figure and
pleasing face were as though made for
the part, and the gracefulness of carriage
of the one and the mobility of the other
did almost as much as the voice for the
unqualified success of the young San
P"rani tscan.
The quality of the voice, however Is
what tells in opera, and this Miss Cotte
possesses in a high decree. It is a clear

GOVERNMENT
UNDERTAKERS
PASS THE LIE
An Exciting Scene at
Sixth and Mission.
TROUBLE NARROWLY AVERTED
SABER RHEINHARDT GRILLED
BY WILLIAM SEARS.
The Former Said to Be Besponsible
for the Failure of the Under
taking Expedition to
Manila.
The expedition -which Veft here for Ma
nila several months ago fully equipped to
exhume the bodies of the brave soldiers
who fell on the battlefields In the Philip
pines resulted in a dismal failure, and the
several undertakers who were sent there
by the Government are back again in the
city. The failure of the expedition was
due, bo the men claim, to mismanage
ment on the part of Saber Kheinhardt, a
local undertaker who was placed in
charge by Major Long. Two members of
the expedition, William Sears and W. C.
Pratt, returned recently heartily dis
gusted and sorely grieved over the man
ner in which they are alleged to have
been treated by Rhelnhardt. They have
decided to put in a claim against the
Government for several hundred dollars
apiece which they claim Is due thorn for
back wages and transportation fees to
and from Manila. When the men left
here it was understood that they were to
receive $100 per month and expenses for
their services. On arriving at Manila
General Otis decided to delay the work
of exhuming the bodies and thf> men were
forced to take quarters in the beleaguered
city and support themselves. As they had
not received a cent of money from the
Government this worked quite a hardship
on them. To make matters worse. Khein
hardt, who had been very friendly with
the men previous to his being placed in
charge of the expedition, attempted to
display his authority in a way that made
matters extremely unpleasant, and rather
than submit to his unbearable demeanor
toward them they packed their bag and
baggage and came home. After they left
Manila Rheinhardt communicated with
Major Long in this city and charged Sears
and Pratt with insubordination. Rhein
hardt returned home on the Zealandia,
which arrived last week, and yesterday
afternoon he met his associates; Pratt
ami Sears, at the corner of Sixth and
Mission streets, and had It not been for
the timoly interference of friends serious
consequences might have resulted.
"The charge which you made in your
letter to Major Long Is wantonly false
and I'll shove the words down your
throat, you swell head," exclaimed Sears
angrily.
"It was not." returned Rheinhardt.
"You're a liar." retorted Sears, and the
exasperated undertaker moved threaton
! ingly toward his accuser. Several m<-n
who' were attracted to the scene by the
loud talking and animated gestures of the
nun rushed between them to prevent a
; mix-up.
When seen by a f'nll reporter Sears
! said: "I have no desire to say anything
jin connection with this matter. Mr.
1 Rheinhardt did all he could to make mat
' ters disagreeable down at Manila. He
was afflicted with an aggravated case of
! swoll-head and he did not treat us boys
right. Not satisfied with that, he mis
represented facts to Major Long. If he
had acted properly everything would have
I gone along smoothly."
POLICE CONFISCATING
DEADLY TOY PISTOLS
Twenty-Six Weapons Captured at
the Different City
Schools.
So many accidents have occurred from
the careless use of toy pistols In the hands
of schoolboys during the past week that
the police have at last determined to Btep
In and put a stop to them so far as pos
sible. I>nst Sunday two boys were in
jured and yesterday afternoon John
Flynn. a little fellow living at 420 Union
street, burned the leg of a playmate,
Chesri Tanoggi, with one of the toys.
Lieutenant Bsola instructed his men on
both watches to confiscate any and all
pistols in the bands of children and ar
rest the men who Bold tl:eni. The officers
visited the schools on th.-ir beats yester
day afternoon and the result is thai twen
ty-six pistols are now in the hands of the
police. All are of the sum- pattern. They
are nude of cast iron, with a brilliantly
polished barrel, and retail at the popular
price of l.". cents. Although the pistols are
only intended to shoot blank cartridges,
they will rilso carry a -2 ball. If the boy
who is wielding them Is desirous of fol
lowing in the footsteps of Diamond Dick
Jr., .less.- James or Nick Carter he can
put a wad of pap< r or a few nails In
front of the cartridge and the "toy" then
becomes a deadly weapon. If used at
short range without these accessories it
will Inflict a painful, if not serious, burn,
and the police have determined to sup
press it.
An ordinance was adopted by the Board
of Supervisors In ISS7 making it a mis
demeanor to sell one of these weapons to
any boy under 19 years of age. On the
strength of the testimony given by boys
Whose pistols had been confiscated A il
11am Taylor, a clerk in the employ of
Shreve & Harker. 537 Kearny street, was
arrested last night by Sergeant Chris
tiansen and Officer Hutchings and
charged with violation of the ordinance.
He was afterward bailed out by one of
his employers, and the police are looking
for other vendors of the "toys." The
penalty for th* 1 offense is a fine of JIOOO
or six months' Imprisonment or both, and
Lieutenant Ksola Is determined to prose
cute the cases fully before somebody is
killed or maimed for life.
MORE SMALLPOX PATIENTS.
Two Young Women Nurses at the
Maclean Hospital Contract
the Disease.
Two new cases of smallpox developed
at the Maclean Hospital yesterday. The
patients are Miss Zerelda Pitzer and Miss
Katie I.evis, both nurses employed at the
hoapltal during the time Roy Winchester,
the young man who died from the effects
of the disease a few days ago, occupied
one of the sick wards. The young wo
men were removed to the cottage in the
rear of the hospital, where the two malo
nurses who were stricken with the dis
ease Monday are isolated.
Health Officer O'Brien and City Physi
cian Hereford visited the institution yes
terday and after a consultation with the
hospital authorities decided to place the
entire hospital in quarantine until the dis
â¢aaa has been stamped out. Accordingly
yellow nags and placards were placed on
"the building and no one will be permitted
to enter or leave the place until all dan
ger from Infection has passed. Deputy
health Inspectors and special policemen
will be on watch at all times of the day
and night to enforce these regulations.
MIRED IN THE BOG.
Dozens of Fine Beef Cattle Starving
to Death.
In Monday's Call was an account of a
lot of cattle that had been mired In the j
bog about ten miles below Stockton and
are starving to death. While it is out of
the district of the Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Animals, Secretary
Holbrook made an inquiry as to who is
to blame and offered to assist in any way
possible. From N. S. Johnson, mate of
the river boat Dauntless, he learned that
the cattle were landed from a barge on
the island. The San Juaquin Grand Jury

Mate Johnson describes the scene as the
most shocking and pitiful he ever wit

in the bog, many so deep that only their

ground. From the deck of the river boat
many can be seen In this condition, and
though the men are working with a will

the new Warden of San Quentin Prison,
came to this city last evening as the
guest of Prison Director James B. Wil
kins and did not return to San Francisco
until this morning. The two officials dia
cussed questions of prison policy at some
length, but the ostensible reason for
Aguirre's visit was to have Director "Wil
kins approve his bond.
â¢'Mr. Aguirre informs me." said the di
rector, "that he intends to make no radi
cal â  hanges in official positions, but will
bring his brother and ex-Under Sheriff
McClure of Los Angeles to San Quentin

friends with whom he can sustain con

commissary, but it cannot be learned
whether or not he has been successful.
McClure will take the position of either

there would be no changes at present in
the personnel of the guards.

PREPARING FOR THE ANNUAL
OUTBURST OF PATRIOTISM
Loud Will the Eagle
Scream This
Year.
THE Fourth of July Committee
is now fully organized. The
officers have been chosen, sub
committees appointed and the
real work has begun. The past
year has been a notable one in the
history of the country and it is the
intention of the promoters of the city's
patriotism to make the eagle scream
louder this year than ever beforeâ not
to be a faint echo of that screech
which will begin as the day breaks
over old Maine and her companions of
the "original thirteen," but one loud,
continuous roar that will echo and
re-echo from the new possessions in
the west to the mother States of the
East.
George R. Fletcher, whose hand has
guided other committees and whose
brain has helped plan other celebra
tions, has been chosen chairman this
year, and his fellow-workers have
WILL ERECT A
TWO MILLION
DOLLAR HOTEL
Handsome Structure
on Baldwin Site.
CORPORATION" WILL BUILD IT
HALF OF THE AMOUNT HAS
BEEN SUBSCRIBED.
Eleven Stories of Iron and Stone to
Be Erected in Plac% of the
Present Charred
Ruins.
The eye-assailing ruins which mark the
site of the destroyed Baldwin Hotel will
give way to a structure of iron and stone,
perhaps the most magnificent in this city.
Unless present plans, which are on the
point of consummation, miscarry, a hotel
â will be reared >in the corner 'if Eddy and
Market streets which will vie with the
most famous buildings of Its kind. Two
millions of dollars will be expended in the
construction of this magnificent edifice,
in which the besi features of modern ar
chitecture will find materialization.
Ever since the fateful night when the
old hotel was laid in ashes schemes for
the rebuilding of what was left of tho
Baldwin block have been as prolific as
they were chimerical. Kirst it waa a
theater ami a Mr hotel which would
adorn that part of the city. Then Bald
win himself would come forward with
plans for a low two-storied huilding, and
on the following day he would announce
to the public thai be had Thanked his
mind and would permit investors to
beautify the city by building a multi-
Btoried hostelry upon his land.
Tin- present BChem< has received the at
tention of a number of local capitalists
who have formed a corporation for the
jiurpo.se of building a hotel which in ar
chitectural beauty and practical utility
will far surpass any other hotel in this
city. It will lie eleven stÂ»ries in height,
the ground floor to he a -series of large
stores with a frontage on Powell. Ellis
and Market streets. Th< intention of the
builders is not to have a theater in the
. utilizing the entire building space
for rooms.
Baldwin was forced into the business
end of the scheme, and it is said that he
gave mi unwilling acquiescence to the de
mands of the capitalists who have joined
together and formed a corporation. Ar
chitects have been engaged to prepare
)>lans for the new building, and that part
of the work is now progressing. A mil
lion of dollars has been subscribed for
instruction of the building. The sec
ond million will bo forthcoming when the
time arrives. This, together with the
12,500,000 valuation on the land, will make
a $4,500,000 property out of the corner,
which is in the core of the city's traffic.
Baldwin has left the city for the south.
All that remains to make the deal a cer
tainty is the signing of a few contractual
agreements which have been prepared al
ready. It is expected that the entire mat-
been everywhere congratulated on the
happy choice. Mr. Fletcher is well
known, not only in the outlying dis
tricts where, his interests are, but
throughout tho city and State.
Robert W. Dennis has been chosen
for the position of secretary of the
Keneral committee. Although not as
old in years or experience as Mr.
Fletcher, he has already shown his
capability in many ways. James S.
Devlin is not new to the position of
treasurer. He has already filled it
several times, and there has never
i murmur of discontent at his
method of handling- the finances. The
other committeemen are well known
in the city, and they have entered into
the spirit of the day with a zest that
promises great things.

C. W. FREESE A WHARFINGER.
Solitary Appointment by the Harbor
: Commissioners. '
The Harbor Commissioners were ex
j pected to make a . number of official
changes at the meeting yesterday, but
they failed to materialize, with the ex
ception of one which Commissioner Har
ney slipped in during a lull in the pro
ceedings. This was the appointment of
C. \V. Freese. a relative of Captain A. C.
Freese, ex-Public Administrator, to a
wharfinger's berth in the place made va
cant by the expiration of the term of !
service of J. S. Wiggins. The expected I
! appointments will come later in the |
i month.
The Southern Pacific was on - hand '
through its paymaster, J. M. Hanford, to
protest against the charges on slips, both I
ferry and freight. Its protest was not so I
much against what it was paying, but
, against alleged discrimination. For the i
i landings in front of the ferry building i
the company says it pays an average of
$1060 a month for each slip. It alleges
1 that the two adjoining slips are rented to
the California and Northwestern Railway
for $480 and $600 a slip. The company also
: objected to the payment of $19,200 a year
for the Second street freight slip it is now
j using.
The- board's stated reason for the varia
tion in the charges is because the South- |
crn Pacific finds much more use for slips
than the other companies, and taking pat
tern after C. P. liuntington. it is charging
"all the traffic will bear." It was de- !
I cided to set aside a time for the hearing
of the petition of the company and settle
the matter.
The engineer of the board reported that
Broadway pier 2 was being overloaded by
Goodall, Perkins & Co. The dock will
stand a load of about 250 pounds to the i
, square foot, and the steamship people are ,
; said to be piling nail Kegs, weighing 100 |
pounds each and occupying an area of ,
about one square foot, in tiers six feet j
high. Six hundred pounds to the foot was ;
beyond anything the wharves could stand. :
the engineer said, and he suggested in j
that connection that wharves should be!
, built to stand more of a load than has j
been the custom in the past.
Captain Goodall was on hand to explain
i matters, which he did by urging press of ,
business, and as a result he was given j
i more space on section 4 of the seawall.
SEVERELY WOUNDED.
Private Julius Crow Is Shot Through
the Right Lung.
Private Julius Crow, Company D, cas
ual detachment, now lies in the General I
Hospital at the Presidio suffering from a !
wound that may prove fatal. He was <
shot in a most peculiar manner on Sat- j
urday morning while at target practice, j
The soldier was engaged behind the tar- i
get in keeping the score. In some way j
the bullet after it struck the target was
deflected downward and struck Crow un- |
der the right shoulder-blade, passing en- |
tirely through him and perforating the j
lung. The bullet was tired from a Krap- i
Jorgensen rifle and at long range. No one !
seems just able to explain how the acci- j
dent happened, but it is supposed that
the soldier was standing up at the time '
behind the butts of the target, and that j
the bullet struck the base of the target
and probably hit a piece of the iron
framework and glanced.
When Crow was first taken to the hos
pital his death was momentarily expected, j
out owing: to his wonderful vitality he

PORT WARDENS
WILL NOT YIELD
UP THEIR SEATS
Governor's Appoint
ees Must Go to Law.
A LIVELY CONFERENCE HELD
PROVOST AND ATTWOOD RE
FUSED TO RESIGN.
Senator Braunhart Will Not Yield.
Gage's Men Begin to Think He
Has Given Them a Gold
Brick.
Governor Gage's appointees alon&
the water front have not succeeded in
dropping into their seats as easily as they
anticipated. F. S. Chadbourne is on the
outside waiting for Rudolph Herold Jr. to
vacate his position as Harbor Commis
sioner, and now come the new Port
Wardens, whom the gentleman from the
scuth has selected, and who, judging
from what trajisplred yesterday, are
likely to pose for many a long and weary
month as "select men."
(Yesterday Charles Spear and Senator
V. W. Burnett, Governor Gape's men,
waited on Percy Henderson. Sam Braun
hr.rt and Captains N. Provost and H. R.
Atrwood In conference, and Rpear and
P.urnett expressed their anxiety to per
form the duties of Port Warden at once.
These gentlemen presented their creden
t'als from the Governor, and formally
asked Captains Provost and Attwood to
vacate their scats. This Is exactly what
these gentlemen have no Intention of
doing-. They claim, and with considerable
earnestness, that they were appointed for
the space of four years and that not till
their four years have expired will they
abandon their posts. The -credentials of
Messrs. Spear and Burnett, they politely
Intimate, are so much waste paper, and
say that they will pay no attention to
what Governor Gage lias done In the mat
ter of appointments now.
They argue with some show of reason
that when Governor Perkins went, into
office he created three Port Wardens, who
were to hold for foar years. His ap
pointees held for four years, though the
Governor himself only held for three
years, owing to the adoption of the new
constitution. Ever since the office of
Port Warden was created the appointees
have held for four years, and neither
Captain Provost nor Captain Attwood
feels Inclined to break this time-honored
rule.
There were arguments for nearly two
hours, thn newly appointed Port Wardens
desiring to impress upon the stolid under
standing of the present holders the all
embracing power of the Governor and
how futile it was to buck "against the
Governor." The four holders, however,
entertain quite a different opinion as 'to
bucking the power of the Governor," in
somucn that Samuel Braunhart, whose
term of office has expired, also announced
his Intention of refusing to vacate his
seat.
â¢â¦What?" asked Charles Spear in tones
in which the accents of astonishment
and fear struggled hard for the mastery,
"don't you intend to resign and let your
successor have your seat?"
"Not much," replied Samuel, as he lit
a fresh cigar. "Not if I know it. The Gov
ernor hasn't got the right to make any
appointment, and I'll tell you why. He
had the right, but he's so precious smart
that ho didn't seize the opportunity, and
now that he has lost it he's going to lose
Both Burnett and Spear asked for fur
ther information.
"It's this way," said Braunhart. "My
term as Port Warden expired while the
Senate was in session. The Governor had
the right to name my successor and let
him be confirmed by the Senate, but he
didn't, and now he's got no right to name
a man. Oh. we'll teach them jays from
Los Angeles that they don't know every
thing. We are tin de siecle, we are, here
iin San Francisco. We ain't no back num
bers, and so the man who wants my seat
can whistle for it."
And thus the matter stands. Captains
Provost and Attwood are determined
t to stay out their term of office, while Sen
ator Braunhart declared he has the law
with him. and the Governor's man Oick
ell) can stiind and wait or make a light
in the courts. The present holders are
serene and smiling; the men who haye
been appointed are on the warpath. In
their rage they are ready to blame Gage
for having given them a gold brick. All
they have at present received is the
merry ha-ha.
During the discussion the Port \\ ar
den's secretary. John Harrigan, duly
noted the demand of Messrs. Spear and
Burnett for their seats, an.l also placed
on record the fact that Messrs. Provosi
and Attwood refused to yield up their
seats. Tli.- meeting then adjourned with
', victory perching on the banner of the
i present board of Port Wardens. Governor
Gage's appointees will now have to ap
peal to the courts.

SUPERVISORS TO MEET
AT THE MAYOR'S CALL
Strange Crisis in the Affairs of the
Municipality.
Phelan Is on the Horns of a Dilemma â Important
Issues Dependent on the Legality of the
Supervisorial Session Held Last Monday.
AMOPT unusual complication has
Hris.-n in the Supervisorial situa
tion and recourse may yet have
t.> ]>â -> had to the courts to bring
order and legality out of what is now
practical chaos. Mayor Phelan and the
minority members of the Hoard of Su
pervisors are determined to protect
what they have already won by their
strategy and to Insure the success of
the new propositions they have on
hand. The majority members of the
I are equally determined to carry
through the schemes which their cor
ion masters insist shall be ac
complished. The Mayor and his faith
ful allies are seeking to force the ga.s
company to terms, yet the majority
stand pledged to bow to the will of the
company if a meeting of the board be
called.
Mayor Phelan is therefore between
two tires. If he calls a meeting of the
rviÃors he Jeopardizes his fight
against the gas company and gives the
rity members of the board an op
mlty to pass gas bills and defeat
Mayor's purpose to bring the cor
poration to terms. If Mayor Phelan
not call a meeting Of the board
until the thst Monday in July a great
injustice will be done to tradesmen and
hants and distress will come un
3sarily to hundreds of municipal
employes.
While the Mayor has not yet reached
a final conclusion in the matter he has
practically decided to call the Super
visors together next Monday. If he
this he will try to force from the
majority members an agreement that
none of th" mooted questions before the
board will be discussed. If this prom
â  given and the Mayor still con
siders it a necessity to call the" Super
visors together every possible effort
will be made, as In the franchise cases,
feat the plans of the majority by
parliamentary mea ns.
N- ,i:ly every important feature of the
controversy will turn upon the legality
of th( held last Monday by the
majority members of the board. As
these members will meet next Monday
the Mayor in all likelihood will issue an
official call and assemble the entire
board. This action, however, will not
unravel th-- legal tangle. After as
sembling th.- board will have to pass
ally upon the last meeting. The
serious question of what was legally
th- last meeting will then arise and will
have to be determined. The majority
members of the board will insist that
the revolutionary meeting held by thorn
on Monday was the last regular meet-
Ing and a demand will Vie made for the
adoption of the minutes of that meet
ing.
If these minute? be adopted official
and legal Indorsement of the revolu
tionary meeting will he given and
Mayor Phelan will he forced tacitly to
admit that a legal meeting of the Board
Of Supervisors may be held without his
authorization. Such an admission <>n
the part of th<> Mayor and the minority
will he a sacrifice of one of their strnng
ntentions in the controversy. The
majority members of the board may
then proceed to d<> as they please with
in the prescribed limits of the con
solidation act.
If. on the other hand, the Mayor and
the minority contest the adoption of
the minutes of the revolutionary meet
ing and insist that the last regular
meeting of the board was held a week
ago last Monday, then another compli
cation will arise. When thf majority
members met on Monday they adopted
the minutes of the previous meeting.
thus Riving absolute legality to the
proc linirs of that session. If the
Mayor and the minority succeed in con
struing the revolutionary meeting to be
illegal, then the minutes <>r the previ
ous meeting will stand unapproved and
the majority members will be in a posi
tion t<> question every action that was
then taken.
This is a contingency of such serious
Importance that the Mayor knows

hardly what to do. At the meeting
held a week ago last Monday bills ag
gregating several thousands of dollars
were indorsed and ordered paid. Under
the strict letter of the law the legality
of the order of payment is not com
plete until the minutes of the meeting
have been adopted at a subsequent and
legal session of the board.
A cloud will therefore be thrown
over the whole affair. The majority
members of the board will not on Mon
day agree to adopt the minutes of the
meeting held last Monday a week ago
on the ground that they have already
been adopted. The minority members
will not agree to adopt the minutes of
the meeting held on Monday on the
ground that the session was illegal. It
is a question of the most serious mo
ment to determine at the present time
just where a point of agreement In the
controversy can be reached.
There is very little likelihood that two j
of the must important measures before |
the board will be Involved in the mud- i
die. The tremendous steal of the Mar
ket Street Railroad Company has for- \
tunately been prevented. If the greedy '
corporation asks for anything it will
confine its demand to the "corkscrew \
franchise" or crosstofwn franchise. The :
blanket- franchise, Involving so many
enormous thefts, will beabandoned. The
anti-bookmaklng law appears also to
!â â¢â  sate, as the majority members of I
the board have decided to postpone in
definitely all further discussion of the j
repeal. The only remaining important
question is upon gas rates, and that. It
appears, cannot be evaded.
Some incidental Interest attached
yesterday to the official quarrel because :
of the actions of Supervisors Keyer and !
Byington, both members of the minor
ity. Supervisor Heyer is chairman of :
the Fire Department committee. Sup
porting the contention of himself and i
the Mayor that the meeting of the ma
jority members of the board, held on;
Monday, was illegal, Supervisor Heyer j
refused to call a meeting of the com- :
mittee of which he is chairman. He 'â 
insists that there was nothing before I
his committee to consider, and. there- j
fore, he did not call a meeting. The i
other members met, however, and tran- j
sacted routine business of no general
Importance.
Supervisor Byington's action, how- i
ever, was different. He is chairman
of the Judiciary Committee, and pre
sided as usual yesterday at the regu- j
lar meeting of the committee. The in- i
cident had no special significance ex- !
cept to demonstrate that the minority
members of the Board of Supervisors |
have not yet determined in their own
minds whether or not to consider the j
meeting of Monday legal.
HASTINGS LAW COLLEGE
TO HAVE A NEW DEAN
DR. E. R. TAYLOR TO SUCCEED
JUDGE C. W. SLACK.
Latter Resigns Owing to Pressure of
Private Business but Will Con
tinue as a Professor.
Ex-Judge Charles W. Slack has handed
in his resignation as dean of the faculty
of the Hastings College of Uw and his
resignation has been accepted, though re
gretfully, by the trustees of that insti
tution. Dr. E. R. Taylor has been ap
pointed to succeeed Judge Slack as dean
and will assume the duties of the position
at the opening of the college in August.
Judge Slack was appointed dean <>f the'
faculty in !*!)"> and his administration has j
been a marked success. Since his retire- |
ment from the bench, however, his pn- j
vate practice has grown to such propbrr
tions that he felt that he could not devote i
the time to the college that his position
as dean of the faculty demanded, hence j
his resignation. The trustees, while loth
to accept his resignation, were forced to '
take that course, as he informed them
that his resolution to retire was (irmly
fixed.
I >r. Taylor is one of the. leading mem- I
I" rs of the San Francisco bar and enil- j
nently qualified by education and training !
to fill the position satisfactorily. He has
been a resident of this city for nearly
forty years and is very highly spoken of
by his associates in the profession ol th>>
law. He is an active member and former j
president of the liar Association, and was I
one of the leaders In the movement to ae
cure the passage by the Legislature of
the bill for the remodeling of the jury
system.
At the urgent request of the trustees j
Judge Slack has consented to continue a.a
one of the assistant professors of the col
lege and will continue his course, of lee- |
tures on pleadings and practice, which
have attained great popularity among the
students of the institution.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JUNE 7, 18TKJ.
WAGERING ON
OUTCOME OF
THE BIG FIGHT
Fitzsimmons Rules a
Warm Favorite.
SPORTING MEN AT VARIANCE
OPINIONS EQUALLY DIVIDED AS
TO CHANCES OF MEN.
The Comishman's Ringmanship Is
Expected to Offset the Angeleno's
Advantages of Superior
Weight and Youth.
If It Is the difference of opinion that
makes horse racing a recognized sport
throughout the world something of that
same quality must enter Into the same of
boxing. On Friday night Fitzsimmons
and Jeffries will meet in the ring at Coney
Island and will battle for what is con
cAled to be the â¢ championship of the
world. This, properly, should be decided
in a. contest to a finish, but as that kind
of a meeting; is prohibited the only sub
stitute is the limited bout.
The difference of opinion as to the out-
come of the forthcoming battle Is strongly
defined among the men who are. recog
nized authorities on boxing. Here is a
line-up taken haphazard: For Jeffries -
Alex Greggains. Eddie Graney, Harry
Corbett. Billy Jordan. Tom Sharkey if
fight lasts twelve rounds. For Fitzslm
monsâJack Btelzner, Tim McGrath. \V.
J. Kennedy, \V. K. Wheelock, Johnny
Farley Joe Harvey, Johnny Humphrey,
Billy Nolan and Mike KatzenFtoin.
The betting commenced in earnest yes
terday, interest in the contest bating,
seemingly, just awakened. The odds in
the local poolrooms were 10 to 7, Fitzsirn
mona ruling favorite. In tho. IsaÂ«t tli-*
Cornishman was a 2 to l favorite. The
wide difference in tlv odds wns readily
explained by Harry Corbett. "There arc\
several reanons for effrles being in greater
demand here, than in the Kast," he said
yesterday. "Jeffries Is a Californian,
which in itself would appeal to the bet
tors here. To accent this both he and
Billy Delaney, his trainer, are writing- Jot
ters to friends here- keeping them in
formed of His training and his prospects
"Another reason is that the bookmakers,
who are the heaviest bettors, are in the
East attending the races and their money
is going in on Fitzslmmons. as they in
variably; play the r favorite. , If they y were
here nituu" of ; them , would -be influenced
by local conditions and their money would
have tended to shorten the odds on Jef
fries.
"The persons who favor Jeffries are
chiefly the small bettors, who risk $5 or
$10 at the outside. The Fitzsimmons peo
ple play big money, seldom less than $100
or $130. One of the many reasons that
Jeffries is played by the small bettors is
the fact that three short-enders won at
Woodward's Pavilion last Wednesday.
This is a small matter, but many men
will be influenced by it. playing the short-
enders until some favorite breaks the
spell. The betting has been steady, and
ii the volume continues we will handle
$60,000 on the outcome of the fight."
Tim McGrath; who is one of the shrewd
est handlers of boxers, sees no one in the
fight but Fitzsimmons. The difference In
the weight of the men cuts no figure in
the outcome according to his view of the
impending struggle. He thinks if Jef
fries stands off and spars he will get the
worst of it, while if he mixes things Fitz
will find a weak spot under his guard.
McGrath is of the opinion that Jeffries*
poor showing with Bob Armstrong in the
East has influenced the betting there.
Jeffries' stock went down noticeably when
he made so poor a showing with the
negro. â  *
Opposed to McGrath is Alex Greggains,
a master at the art of boxing. Two
things will beat Fitzsimmons," he paid
yesterday. "Lack of weight and the fact
that Jeffries has been boxing with Tommy
Ryan. Jeffries has always been quick for
a man of his weight, and boxing with
Ryan must have improved' him. >To man
can give away the weight Fitzsimmons
has been asked to do in this case and
hope to win against so good a man. Jef
fries is game as a pebble. I have seen.
Henry Baker hit him a ripht-hand- punch
that ought to stop any man. Jeff only
shook his head and sailed Into Baker. It
takes a game man to go after his oppo
nent when he is beinp punished badly.
In the paris mutuela at Corbett'3 the
bulk of the money so far wagered Indi
cates that the majority of the dollar hot
tors pick Fitzsimmons to win in the first
half of the fight. After that Jeffries has
a slight lead, especially -on the line from
1" to 21 rounds. The complete table fol

J. Smith, a visitor to the city, living at

the dice. One of them in alarm shouted
that the police were coming and said to
Smith, "(live me ynur purse, quick,'' and
Smith obeyed. The men then disappeared.

NEW ELECTRIC
COMPANY LETS
A BIG CONTRACT
It Means Work for a
Thousand Men.
FOR ELECTRIC WIRE CONDUITS
CLAUS SFRECKELS' AGREEMENT
WITH GRAY BROTHERS.
The Latter Firm to Do the Under
ground Work for the Inde
pendent Company â Will
Bequire a Year.
The Independent Electric Ught and
Power Company is rapidly perfecting its
arrangements to enter the field in active
competition with existing concerns en
gaged in the same line of business. A
contract for the construction of an under
ground system of conduits, involving an
outlay of $1,250,000, has just been entered
into with Gray Brothers. The work will
be commenced immediately and hurried
to completion.
The magnitude of the undertaking will
be in a measure realized when It is stated
that the enterprise will require fourteen
months of continuous labor and will give
employment to a thousand men. The
amount of money that will be expended
for labor will alone approximate $1,000,000,
and as money thus expended is put Into
immediate circulation, the direct benefit
to San Francisco can easily be estimated.
The contract was signed by Claus
Spreckels, president of the company, and
Gray Brothers a week ago, but the fact
j did not become generally known until
yesterday. The statement is made by a
member of the firm of Gray Brothers
that employment will be given to from
800 to 1000 men continuously as soon as
the work is fairly under way and as the
, te.iring up of the streets will begin within
the next four weeks the laborers have not
long to wait.
"We are already engaged in the prelim
inary preparations for the beginning of
the work," said Harry Gray last night,
"and will get started in about thirty days.
We estimate that the contract will take
from twelve to fifteen months. We have
contracted to put in a million feet of con
duits, and nil the work is to be completed
by the time the plant is ready to start up.
, We will have, our part done in time. The
work will be of a most substantial ohar-
I acter and all the material used will be
produced in California. The main con
duits will be of terra-cotta and the lat
erals will lie of iron pipe. They will be
laid on a bed of concrete to insure the
greatest possible durabilUy and stability.
We propose to push the work will;
all diÃpatch consistent with good
workmanship. The city will be divided
into districts in each of which a gang of
men will be at work at the same time, the
\ entire force aggregating probably a thou
sand men."
The fact that contracts for miles of
wire and the great boilers which will he
used In the plant have been let has al
ready been published, and the engineers
â  are now engaged in the task of selecting
the most approved dynamos and other
machinery. Plans are also being prepared
for the power-house, which will ne located
on the water front near the old sugar
i refinery, occupying two entire blocks. As
Boon as these plans are completed con
tracts for the construction of the build
ing will !"â¢ let. and it is expected that the
i plant will be in operation in about
i eighteen months.

ASPHYXIATED BY GAS,
A Loose Stopcock Caused the Death
of Miss Kate Cunningham, a
Young Domestic.
Miss Kate CunninÃham. a domestic 24
years old. employed by E. Barnes at 809
Fierce street, came to her death some
time during last Monday night by being
asphyxiated with illuminating gas in her
room. The. stopcock of the gas jet was
so loose that it could be turned with a
mere touch of the finger. There were no
unusual conditions about the room and
Coroner Hill, after a personal investiga
tion, expressed his opinion that it was a
case of accident.
The unfortunate girl had laid the table
in the dining-room ready for yesterday
morning's breakfast and the kindling
wood was placed under the stove. She
retired on Monday night in a cheerful
mood and there was no reason discover
able that would load to the belief that she
had committed suicide.
The body was removed to the residence
of her parents, 1345 Pierce street. Miss
Cunningham was a sister-in-law of Po
liceman J. Cullinane.
