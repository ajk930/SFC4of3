with the Santiago campaign President
McKinley, 1 understand, proposes to con
tinue Major Genera] Shatter in command
ol the Department of the Pacific with his
present volunteer rank after the time is
reached for his retirement on the 14th of
next month.
Under the law his reiirexnant, after

concerned, and there are some who ques
tion the authority for assigning retired
officers to command under the volunteer
rank. But the President. I am told, has
been looking into the matter and believes
that there is nothing to prevent General
Shatter from continuing in his present
command under his volunteer commission
of major general so long as authority for
keeping up the provisional army exists.
The President proposes to renew his
recommendation to Congress for some
substantial recognition for General Shaf
t< r's services in the Spanish war, and it
Is hoped that by continuing him on the
active list with his present rank of major
general legislation may be secured which
will permit him to retire with at least
that rank when it comes the time for
mustering out the provisional army.
There is one precedent for the proposed
action in General Shafter's case. General
Graham, who was in command of (.'amp

teer i â â mmand for several months aft^r
he had reached the age for retirement as
an officer of the regular army. The ac

the time, but subsequently decided to al
low him pay for the time he served under
his volunteer commission.
When thf time comes for General Shaf
fer's retirement next month an oppor
tunity will be offered for rewarding one
of the Philippine heroes wfth a brigadier
ship. Major General Lawton, who has
only the rank of colonel in the regular
establishment, will, according to the pro
gramme as at present arranged, be made
brigadier general of the regular army.

Wheaton, colonel of Infantry, Is booked

Merriti retires. The retirement of the
latter officer will also open the way for
the appointment of a major general in the

Mrs. Foltz claimed it should have read
"An assault with intent to commit mur

crime as attempt to murder mentioned In

SAN FRANCISCO, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 6, 1899.
CASEY SWEARS HOWARD
PLANNED GREEN'S MURDER
James Kelly, Another of the Clever Band of Sneak Thieves, Is
Caught in a New Daring Robbery, and Is Now Held Pris
oner in the City of Mexico.
The Arch Conspirator Howard Has Been Traced to Canada, Where the
Police Authorities Expect to Apprehend Him at Any Moment-Sen
sational Developments in the Criminal Conspiracy That Found Its
Center oi Operations in This City.
THE mystery of the ftidvementa 1
and operation;; of the criminal .
conspirators whose leader and
dominating spirit la Augustus
Howard has practically been
solved by Chief of Police Lees and his
officers. A second member of the dan
gerous band. James Kelly, is in prison
in the City of Mexico under the name
of William Watson, and is likely to pay
the penalty for a Berious and daring of
fense. He is the thi<-f irho was repre
sented by his fellow thiof James
Casey, as being dead and buried in a
New Orleans cemetery. The arrest ol
Kelly has prompted ;h'.- police to toll
all they know of the manipulations of
tho Howard gang and the story reveals
another nest < f experienced, clever
bank sneaks and safe robbers, whose
operations have been international,
whose ability has been dangerous to
every community in which they moved
and whose eseapo from justice has
been most remarkable.
All of them, according to Chief of Po
lice Lees, from Howard to the least ex
perienced of the crowd, have either
been under arrest or have worn con
vict stripes. There is every moral con
viction to warrant the accusation that
they robbed the treasure box of the
steamer Alameda and were engaged in
several other daring thefts. In this
work they did r.ot stop at plans of mur
der and did not scruple to stc-op to
petty larceny. Bigamy, forgery, rob
bery and grand larceny are registered
against their names.
And now James Casey, who is under
arrest at the City Prison, adds a cli
max to the registry of their crimes by
declaring that he was paid $5000 by
Augustus Howard to murder AVillard
F. Green and throw his body overboard
from the steamer Alameda. This monej
was to be divided among Casey, Kellj
and Murphy in equal shares. The
money was paid, so Casey told a Cal.
reporter last night, by Howard the
night before the Alameda left this port
This admission has given the police the
chief reason for wishing to capture
Augustus Howard, the head and front
and master spirit of the conspiracy.
When Howard fled from this city he
went north and is now known positive
ly to be in Canada, where his arrest
Is expected any day. The career of
these criminals has been a strange one.

dangerous men, but their traffic in San
Francisco is at an end.
Two of them are in Jail, but the other
three, including the arch conspirator,
Howard, are at liberty and the police
derlare that they will not cease their
efforts until they have placed him be
hind the bars. â¢
The criminal record of this crowd is
interesting. The first trace of it, as far
as the information of (he police goes,
begins in Melbourne, where, in the mid
dle of 1898, Casey, Kelly and Murphy
were arrested for robbery of a ware
house. The dangerous trio did not re
main long in jail, for on October 20,
1898. they succeeded in escaping and
made their way to Auckland, where
they prepared immediately to turn an
other criminal "trick." On November
27, 1898. the branch of the National
Bank of Auckland was robbed of Â£235,
and suspicion fell upon Casey, Kelly
and Murphy. The authorities did not
possess sufficient evidence to arrest,
but now that they have it from the
police of San Francisco, they indicate
no very earnest desire to prosecute.

RAY PLANTS GUNS
ON YUKON'S SHORES
Commander of the American Troops in
Alaska Erects Cannon Fortifications
at the Town of Eagle,
Special Dispatch to The Call* ' =
TACOMA, Wash., Sept. 3.â Two
big warlike cannon point out over
the banks of the Yukon from
Eagle. They stand on a broad
plateau rising thirty feet above
the stream, commanding the mighty
river for miles. This interesting infor
mation is brought 1 by S. A. Warren,
just arrived from Eagle. One might
imagine, he says, that the American Yu
kon metropolis was going to war with
British Dawson, a few miles across the
line up the golden Yukon. Colonel Ray,
commanding the American Yukon sol
diery, completed the erection of the
two cannon a few days before the
Warren left Eagle, August 8. Several
salutes were fired in honor of the
event. There are 150 soldiers at Eagle,
and Colonel Ray is pushing work as
rapidly as possible on the Government
barracks, which are to cost ?200,000. He
wishes to get the men housed before
known as T. Lewis, and of whom the
police have little knowledge, registered
at the Palace Hotel, occupying the
same apartment. Mrs. Kelly and her
child went to the Russ House, register
ing under the name of Mrs. Reid and
child. Kelly secured rooms elsewhere,
but was very frequently at the Russ
House. Murphy found quarters in a
hotel on Third street.
As already indicated, the police
know very little of Lewis, with the
exception that he was in constant as
sociation with the rest of the gang
and came to this city with them on the
Maiiposa. Lewis also left on the
Mariposa on April 20, 1889. with Mur
phy, for Sydney. Murphy on this oc
casion gave the name of J. W. Win
ton. On the return trip on the steamer
Alameda a man who called himself a
mining man returned under the name
of Albert Lewis. Whether this Albert
Lewis is T. Lewis the police have as yet
been unable to determine. These asso
ciations and connections oL' Lewis and
the rest of the crowd are particularly
significant in relation to the robbery
of the treasure box on the Alameda. It
has been established absolutely that
Murphy was in Auckland two days be
fore the robbery of the Alameda took
place, and Lewis was supposed to be
in Sydney at the time of the robbery.
With Casey and Kelly definitely lo
cated in thiF city, tho circumstances
connecting all of these criminals with
Ihp robbery are very strong.
After this robbery was commute-]
thr> police directed their suspicions to
Kelly and Casey, of whom very little
was known at the time by the police
authorities. In this investigation the
police succeeded, quite unexpectedly
to themselves, in establishing the fact
that Casey and Kelly were two of the
men who had robbed the Auckland
Bank. On February 16, 1899, the Chief
of Police received a letter from J. R
Tunbridge, Commissioner of Police of
Wellington. New Zealand. This letter
detailed the circumstances of the rob
bery of the bank and gave a descrip
tion of the notes which had been
stolen. It will be remembered that the
fact had been definitely established
that Casey and Kelly arrived in this
city on January 11, 1899, from Auck
land. In the local investigations of the
police it was discovered that the very
notes which had been stolen from the
branch Bank of Auckland had been
disposed of in this city by two men
answering perfectly the description of
Kelly and Casey. The notes were sold
to Sutro Co., Goldberg & Co., and
Neville & Co., on January 13th and
25th. Two crimes had thus been fas
tened beyond dispute upon Casey and
Kelly.
The police were in a much better po
sition to trace the criminals than be
fore. Photosraphs of the malefactors
were obtained and local officers re
newed their vigilance. On March 30,
1899, a wagon of the Anglo-California
Bank stopped at the express office of
Wells, Fargo & Co. on New Montgom
ery street. The wagon contained $10,000
in gold coin. A moment after the ve
hicle came to a standstill a well-

The cannon fortifications command
the river for some distance above and
below the town, which is now a port

will be fired at them. There is still
another very interesting sight at
Eagle just now. Three hundred tons

dressed man engaged the driver.
Waters, in conversation and inquired
the way to the Grand Hotel. While the
driver was talking to the stranger a
thief abstracted the coin, from the
wagon and escaped. The driver has
been shown the picture of James Kelly
and identified it positively as the pict
ure of the man who engaged him in
conversation on the morning of March
30. The other man who stole the
money is supposed to be either Casey
or Murphy, although the police have
nothing in their possession to warrant
more than a suspicion. Casey and Kel
ly remained in San Francisco for some
time, although they made one trip to
the Sandwich Islands shortly after the
twbbery of the wagon. During the stay
of the conspirators here Mrs. Kelly
and her child changed their residence
from the Russ House to a private home
on Devisadero street.
On May 23, 1599, Casey and Kelly left
this city for their Southern trip, which
has resulted so disastrously to both of
them. They went from here by way of
Los Angeles to New Orleans, and from
there to the City of Mexico. Casey re
mained but a very short time, when he
returned to San Francisco, arriving
here on August 25. Shortly afterward
he was arrested, and when asked what
had become of Kelly declared that he
had died of typhoid pneumonia in New
Orleans. When Casey was arrested the
police captured a trunk and several
satchels marked by the name of Wat
son. Casey insisted that the bag-grape
belonged to him, but the police very
soon discovered that he was lying. In
the trunk was a picture of a woman
and a child, who Casey declared were
his wife and baby. The poMce did not
believe him, and upon investigation
proved that the pictures were those of
the wife and child of Kelly. This led to
the trail of Kelly and to a knowledge of
his disastrous manipulation in the City
of Mexico.
In that city Kelly and a confederate
who, the police are almost absolutely
certain, is Casey, committed another
daring daylight robbery which in every
particular resembles the crimes that
have been established against the two
men. On July 29. at the National Bank
in the City of Mexico, a man by the
name of Jose Rojano was robbed of
$10,000 in notes at the paying window
of the bank. Rojano had placed the
bunch of bills on the counter and was
en gaged in counting a small amount
of silver. While doing this he was ac
costed by a stranger, who asked some
question. Rojano answered the query
and turned to find that his bunch of
bills had disappeared. Another man,
evidently in collusion with the inquir
ing stranger, had snatched the notes
and was making for the door. An
alarm was given and the chase fol
lowed. The robber was caught after a
flight of a few blocks and the bills were
found in his possession. He was ar
rested and taken to jail, and gave the
name of William Watson, the alias
under which Kelly had manipulated so
often and so successfully.
James Kelly had been caught again.
After remaining in prison for some
time he was visited at his own request
by the British Vice Consul at the City
of Mexico. Kelly begged the Consul to
believe that he was a British subject.
He declared that he had just received
a letter from his wife from Cornwall,
England, and that, made desperate by
her representations of distress, he had
committed the crime. This fictitious
story made an impression, but shortly
afterward Kelly received a telegram
from George D. Collins, an attorney of
this city, who is now defending John
Casey in the Police Court. In the
meantime Chief of Police Lees had
been corresponding with the police au
thorities of Mexico, and had establish
ed beyond precedence the interesting
face that William Watson was James
Kelly, one of the most accomplished
bank sneaks in the world. The zeal of
Collins had done much to betray the
whereabouts of his client.
While Casey and Kelly were engaged
in their operations on this side of the
Pacific, Murphy and Lewis were not
by any means idle on the other side.

Murphy and went on to Sydney. On
June 2, 5000 sovereigns were found

The two men had, therefore, ample op
portunity in which to commit the rob

PRETORIA, Sept. s.â The Volksraad to-day accepted Mr. Coester's motion to fix the debates to grow out of the
Interpellation of the Government as to the assembling of British troops along thÂ« Transvaal borders for Thursday
next. In presenting his motion Mr. Coester referred to the Jameson raid and other outrages and murders "committed
by British troops" aa leading him to distrust the present concentration. He declared that the convention of i^s4 did
not contact the suzerainty stipulation, and he maintained that Mr. Chamberlain had broken that convention by in
terfering in the Internal affairs of the republic. Other Burghers supported Mr. Coester, saying that while ne
gotiations were proceeding, all the British colonies were offering armed assistance. "And must the Transvaal remain
silent," exclaimed the Burgher. "It Is opposed to Christianity to conduct friendly negotiations and yet mobolize the
troops. We must know why the British troops are on our borders." The motion to wait until Thursday for the Gov
ernment's reply was agreed to unanimously.
CAPE TOWN, Sept. 6. â Arrangements are being completed for safeguarding the telegraphic communication
with the Cape in case of war with Great Britain and the Transvaal. Refugees to the number of 147 have arrived
here, and a million cartridges have been forwarded to Pefermaeritzburg, capital of the British territory of Natal.
Many Dutch Farmers are leaving Bechuanaland for the purpose of forming a laager across the frontier.
LONDON, Sept. B. -Sir Henrs M. Stanley, the African explorer, has written a letter to a friend on the Trans
vaal situation, in which he declares that th< only sensible course for England to take is to trust in Joseph Chamber
lain, the Secretary of State foi the Colonies, who la now on trial before the nation and world. "If," Sir Henry
writes, "these complications and wearisome iterai obÃ and unceasing repetitions will not soon terminate, they
must pass to tho next Government, and Mr. chamberlain will then have proved no better than the mediocrites
who mad-- Krugerism possible. The British nation is also on trial before the world, and if we shrink from compell
ing that old man in the Transvaal to deal justly with "ur countrymen we shall sink below zero in the estimation
Of the world, and the decline of our influence and authority in South Africa will be hastened."
Right Hon. John Morley, Liberal member of Parliament for Mi ntroseburgh, addressing his constituents this
evening at Arbreath, dwelt upon the necessity of bo shaping the British policy In dealing with the Transvaal as to
carry the friendly judgment of the Dutch population in South Africa and not to divide the white races. "There
said Mr. Morley, "a more insensate example of human folly than a war that would bring added
burdens. We do not wish ( > be a pirate empire, and war with the Transvaal would mean deep dishonor."
The Times, which comments editorially on the gravity of the situation that necessitates a Cabinet Council
at such an unusual period, says: "It would be unpardonable folly to shut our eyes to the suspiciously dilatory
i resident Kruger's diplomacy and to the energy with which he fs simultaneously preparing for war.
It Is well known thai General Sir Henry Butler has been selected to command ttv British forces, should war un
fortunately come, but it is the clear duty of the Government to take other steps besides the choice of a com

The Presidential party drove past the
historic State House. As he passed the
President took off his hat. The party
reached the reviewing stand at 10:10
o'clock, and the President waited in i
the rooms of the Director of Public
Works until the head of the procession
reached the stand, when he again made
his appearance.

Missouri, Kentucky, West Virginia,

in line.
The visit to the fleet was decided on
this morning, when Admiral Sampson
called upon the President at the Hotel
Walton. It was the intention to have
the chief executive remain here until
Friday to review the naval parade arid
visit the squadron, but the President's
desire to return to Washington to
night caused a rearrangement of the
programme. The visit of the Presi
dent to the squadron proved to be the
greatest marine spectacle ever seen
here. It was the intention to have
Mr. McKinley visit only the New York*
but he grew so enthusiastic over the
great fighters that he visited the flag
ship New York, cruiser Brooklyn and
the battleships Indiana", Massachusetts
and Texas. There was almost a con
tinuous roar of guns during the one
and three-quarter hours that it took
to inspect the vessels. In all 482 guns
were fired by the squadron in the
President's salutes.
Enthusiasm was rampant to-night.
Wherever President McKinley ap
peared he received a tremendous ova
tion, particularly at the Academy of
Music, where the Grand Army was of
ficially welcomed to the city and State
by Mayor Ashbrldge and Governor
Stone. The President was introduced
as "Comrade" McKinley. He said:
It has given me great pleasure to asso
ciate with you to-day. I have been deep
ly touched by many of the scenes which
all of us have witnessed. With the Joy
ous side of the glad reunion of old com
rades who fought side by side in a com
mon cause ana for a common country,
there was the other sad side that so
many of our comrades who two years ago
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 6. 189 S.
had marched proudly with you throusrh
tht city "f Buffalo are no longer in the
ranks. The circle is narrowing. Ah the
years roll on, one after another is not
present at our reunions:, but accounted
for. They have gone to .ioin the great
majority of our comrades who sleep to-
MiKl't beneath the low green tent whose
curtains never outward sway.
But with it all. my comrades. 1 could
not but inquire as I witnessed the vast
procession of old veterans and heard the
plaudit." of the people. I amid not but
ask the question. "What has endeared
this vast army to the American people?
What enshrined you in their hearts?
What has given you a permanent, unper
ishable place in history?" The answer
comes that you saved the nation. It was
because you did something; aye. you sac
rificed something. You were willing to
give up your lives for civilization and lib
ertyânot for the civilization and liberty
of an hour, but of age?. That has given
you the place in the nearts of the Amer
ican people.
Oreat and good deeds nVver die, and
the Grand Army of the Republic is to be
congratulated to-night that th.- Union )t
saved and the peace it secured at Ap
pomattox Courthouse more than a third
of a century ago is stronger, better and
dearer to the American people to-day than
ever before in all our history. We are
once more and forever one peopleâ one In
faith, one in purpose, willing to sacrifice
our lives for the honor of country and the
glory of our flag. The blue and the gray
march under one flagâ we've got but one
flag nowâ the same that our grandfathers
lifted up, the s&me flag which you kept
stainless and made triumphant forever
more.
1 may be pardoned for paying in this
presence that this has been one of the
happiest days of my life, looking in t\\p
faces of my comrades. They are getting
a little too old for war, but they are ail
right. That dv.ing last year and this
summer, we were able to convene 860 000
of the best young men in the United
States, was due to the example of your
patriotism and the inspiration of your
example.
The Presidential party retired from
the hall and drove directly to th> j
Pennsylvania railroad station, where
the party boarded a special train and
left for WashingtoVi.

INVESTIGATION
MAY BE MADE
Inquiry Into Bentheim's
Story.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 5.-The officials
of the State Department have been much
interested in the remarkable story of the
artist, Bentheim. at Atlanta of his con
nection with the German secret service.
The point in his narrative that particu
larly attracts attention at this time is the
allegation that the deputy and Vice Con
sul at Sonneberg has been serving as a
German agent to convey secrets relative
to war material stolen from the French
Government anil that the official has used
the United States consulate and the ofli
cial letterheads and envelopes of the con-
I sulate to further his ends.
The records of the department show j
thai Alvin Florschultz was appointed vice i
and deputy United States Consul at Son
neberg in 1888. He had been connected
with the banking business in the town
and resigned the place of cashier of one
of the largest banks to accept the po-
Bition in the consulate. When the con
sulate was removed from Sonneberg to
Coblenz, Florschultz went along. Ho has
eiven satisfaction at every point and has
1 frequently discharged the duties of Con- ;
sul during the absence of that official.
I lie still holds his place. Inquiry made
Into the accuracy of the detailed state
ments made by Bentheim appears to con- i
firm most of them. His claim that ho I
was a soldier in the Two Hundred and
Second New York Regiment and dis- j
charged in Washington is borne out by
the War Departrbent records. Notwith
standing this the officials of the State
Department discredit Bentheim's state
ments, though now that they have been
given such publicity it may bo found ex
pedient to quietly investigate the matter.
The Qerman embassy treats the Bon
theim story lightly and while the offlciall
say there are a number of circumstances i
referring to his alleged employment in the j
military service at Berlin which are In
consistent with the established system !
there, yet they, will not dignify the story j
by going Into details.
Sculptor Trentanove. who is mentioned
as the one who will be visited by Ben- |
thoim in Washington, has gone abroad. \

DEATH OF GODFREY,
THE WATER WIZARD
Located SubterraneaQ Streams
Througf) the Possession
of Straoge Power.
PASADENA. Sept. s.â Captain John S. Godfrey, renowned nationally and Â£
locally as the "water wizard," died of heart failure at 2:30 o'clock this morn- j.
ing at his homp on North Marengo avenue, aged 72 years. During his long J.
life he has located thousands of wells, solely by the strange power which -$â¢
his friends declare he possessed. He began during the war. When the water Â«j*
in the streams was too muddy to be drunk the soldiers would come to him. V
The captain would walk along over the ground until suddenly he would begin T
to tremble and the perspiration would stand out on his brow. Then the J.
wizard would declare water existed under his feet. It was always found. â¢[â¢
For a time Captain Godfrey was employed on the Gage Canal at San â Â§â¢
Bernardino to locate leaks under the surface. While there President y
Painter of the North Pasendena Water Company heard of him and sent for T.
him. The wizard has been in the employ of the water company for a de- .s.
cade. His sole duty was to locate wells by means of his power. The water j.
company's entire system was located in this manner.
Many tests of the man's power were made. A year or two ago a reser- Â£
vnir was believed to be leaking. Captain Godfrey walked around it and t
located the leak. A shaft was sunk 140 feet and a narrow stream of water J.
was struck. Just where the captain said it would be found. <r
Four yer.rs ago President Painter drove in from Monrovia, ten miles west y
of town. Captain Godfrey walked through the fields near the road and de- V
dared that an underground stream existed at a certain place under foot. T,
The place was in a dry arroyo. Avcriil had. sufficient confidence in the cap- i.
tain's majjic to expend $30,000 to find i.he stream and develop it with an elec- 4.
trie plant. Thf> re.-ult is that he new has many more inches of flowing â¢Â£
water than has the entire town of Monrovia. X
There are thirty other wells, reveial of them pumping water by means T
of electric: plants, that were located by the now dead wizard. One of these j.
was purchased by Millionaire J. W. Hugus of Altaden& A neighbor thought 4.
to cut off Kugus" supply by dinging a well abovp. Captain Godfrey laughed r*
and said that the underground current 190 feet below the surface branched *|
just above the Hugus well and that the proposed well -would prove a failure. **
Such was the result. The well, sunk some thirty feet lower than the ..
Hugus well, never produced a drop of water.
Captain Godfrey was born in Hampton Falls. New Hampshire. He was *r
quartermaster sergeant of the Second New Hampshire "Volunteers.

MODUS VIVENDI
NEARLY SETTLED
Fixes Alaska Boundary
Temporarily.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLING
TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, Sept. 5.â
Unless Canada again interposes obstacles,
negotiations for a modus Vivendi defining
the temporary boundary line between the
.Dominion and Alaska, will 'je concluded
within a few days. Secretary Hay is
naturally very much gratified with the
prospects of an early, though temporary,
settlement of this vexatious controversy
ar.d it is not going too far to say that the
solution is entirely due to the lact and
discretion he has displayed in the nego
tiations which have been In progress ever
since he succeeded Mr. Day as Secretary
of State.
Facts which rarne to my attention to
day show that the Secretary has con
vinced Great Britain of the impregnable
character of the position he has assumed
and that Great Britain's friendliness for
this country has caused her to make con- |
cessions which enablt- an agreement to be i
reached ap to the location of tlm tempo:- !
ary line. The proposed line, 1 understand, |
will be located at the fork of Ohilkat i
River, just above the Indian village ol
Kluckwan. Other points where the line
will be located were agreed upon sitmi
months ago and are not under discussion
at this time. The effect of tin- location of
tin- boundary line as fixed by the Secre
tary and practically agreed to by Great
Britain will bf- that the entiro Lynn Canal
will he under American control and that
Canada will not, under the t'-mporary
agreement, have a port on that water
way.
The question of the Canadian port on
the Lynn Canal will be left to the
tiations for the permanent settlement of j
the dispute. It was reported to-day that j
the modus vlvendi would end in Novem
ber, 1900, but this was specifically denied j
and it seems that so far as the negotia- |
tions have now gone there Is no date fixed
for the termination of the agreement.
The temporary line will cease to exist,
of course, when the permanent line is
agreed upon. The object of the temporary
line, as has been stated, is to determine I
the points where the customs houses of
the United States and the Dominion shall |
be established and the territory which i
shall be patrolled by the police of the i
respective countries. The locution of a |
line will naturally result in preventing j
conflict between Canadians and Ameri
cans which might have given a very seri
ous aspect to the dispute. The high joint
commission will have nothing to do with i
the Alaska boundary question, though the
American members will undoubtedly con
sult with Secretary Hay. Jt seems to be
understood that the commission will not j
re-assemble until the boundary contro
versy is disposed of. as the British Gov- I
ernment In the past has indicated that
the boundary dispute must be settled be
fore the remaining questions can be ad-
Justed. __^_______^_^^^
CALIFORNIA PRODUCTS
FOR THE PARIS FAIR
State Commission Making Splendid
Progress in Collecting the
Exhibits.
LOS ANGELES. Sept. s.â The California
Paris Fair Commission is making com
mendable strides in endeavoring to collect
material tor the display to be made next
year by this State at the great exposi
tion. Secretary Wiggins received orders
from the commission to arrange twenty
five jars of fruit for the exposition proper.
These are now being prepared. They
comprise pears, peaches, watermelon,
apricots, etc., in their natural colors,
slightly heightened by the prepared liquor
in which they are pickled, and present a
most tempting appearance. It may be
possible these twenty-five jars will be
placed on exhibition in the Chamber of
Commerce before they are shipped to their
destination. The chamber has been au
thorized to collect samples of ornamental
woods that abound in this section.
The State commission requests that all
f-xhibits reach San Francisco by Septem
ber 15. Secretary Wiggins says this will
be impossible, as only the wine, cereals
and a few samples of dried fruits will be
in readiness at that time. The southern
portion of California is doing its full duty
toward enhancing this foreign exhibit.
Secretary "U'lrgitis to-day reports that C.
H. Clayton of Lang and J. H. Mclntyre
of Sespe have furnished beautiful samples
of extracted sage honey: Loud & G-urling
of Pomona have forwarded a fine exhibit
of Hemskirke apricots; Ackermann &
Tupley. San Diego, make a creditable ex
hibit of olive oil.

TO KAISER AND KING
Dreyfus' Counsel Asks the Rulers of Germany
and Italy to Permit Schwarzkoppen and
Panizzardi to Testify at Rennes.
RENNES, Sopt. 5.â M. Labori this
afternoon ti-legraphed personal !
appeals to Emperor William
and Kinp Humbert to grant
permission to Colonel Schwarz
koppen and Colonel Panizzardi, Ger
man and Italliin military attaches in
Paria In 1894, to come to Rennes to
testify in thp trial of Captain Dreyfus.
This is the news of the day and the
chief topic of conversation in the cafes
and resorta of the journalists this
ng. The appeals were couched in
eloqueni t< rms, invoking the assist
ance of their Majesties in the name of
justice and humanity. They were quite
supplementary to the formal applica
tion that will be made by the Govern
ment commissiary, Major Carriere.
The demand of M. Labori that the
court-martial should issue process
subject tn the approval of the two sov
ereigns came like a thunderbolt at to
day's session. The step is fraught with
momentous consequences, as it affords
Emperor William an opportunity again
to assume his favorite role of arbitra
tor of the destinies of the world. No
one will be surprised If Colonel
Schwarzkoppen, in the name of the
Kaiser, makes a declaration that will
practically decide the results of the
trial.
Both Pchwarzkoppen and Panlzzardi
must consult their respective sover
eigns before starting, but the counsel
for Dreyfus fully expect them to ar
rivÂ«' here, if they come at all. in time
to give their testimony on Thursday,
in which case the trial would probably
conclude this week and the verdict be
dcliv. â !â¢â¢â <! on Friday or Saturday. This
is the view that obtains this evening,
differing somewhat from the feeling
r in the day.
Jouausi told Demange at the
of the session that If he received
itification that Schwarzkoppen
szardi were coming to depose
he would be prepared to adjourn the
trial pending their arrival. An adjourn
eight hours would prob
ably give them time to get here. A
[max, and one that is sig

morrow's session will begin with
closed doors, to hear from Cernuschi,
the Austrian political refugee, the name
of the foreign attache he has already
mentioned as admitting that he had
received treasonable documents from
Dreyfus. The remainder of his evi
dence will be given in public.
Cernuschi will be subjected to a
searching i ross-< xamlnatlon. The pro?- ;
ecution relies upon him as a last straw.
He was interviewed this evening by
several journalists, and asserted that
he has in his possession documents to
prove every â â â¢â â¢â â  d of his statement yes
terday. According to a rumor now go
in- the rounds, the name of the foreign
agent who, as Cernuschi declares,
showed him documents from Dreyfus
revealing French military secrets, is
Ger.schel). The latter is said to be an
Austrian officer who passed three
months in Paris about the time that
Dreyfus was arrested.
Senator Trarleux, who testified to
day will probably be confronted by j
Generals Mercier, Gonse. De Boisdeffre |

TELLING TESTIMONY
IN DREYFUS' BEHALF
REN'XES. Sept. 5.â M. Cernusohi, the j
political refugee and reputed scion of j
P<r\i.in royalty, who appeared yesterday
before the Dreyfus court-martial as a
witness for the prosecution, was not ex- I

amined by the court during the time it j
sat behind closed doors on this, the sec
end day of the fifth week of Captain Al- |
fred Dreyfus' trial on the charge of trea
son in communicating army secrets to a
forelgr, government.
The examination of the secret espionage
dossier mentioned by Captain Culgnet
during yesterday's sitting of the court
martial occupied the greater part of the
secret session of the court.
When the open session began M. Labor!
presented a formal application to the
court for an order upon Major Carrier?,
the government commissary, to request;
that interested foreign governments,
through diplomatic channels, communi- j
cate to the court various documents velar- !
Ing to the bordereau. M. Laborl ex
plained the purpose of the application by
citing the fact that the court was now in
an extremely delicate situation and add
ed tint he had pointed out to Major Car
riero Colonel Schwarxkoppen and Signor j
Panizzardi as witnesses he deemed neces- ,
sary to summon. M. Labor! said he
thought this step would worry nobody
and that it was in conformity with pre- '
cedents.
Major Carriere replied that he did not
think the government could ask another i
government for the restoration of the doc
uments. He suggested that the defense
could obtain and submit the papers offi
cially to the court. He saw no objection
to hearing Colonel Schwarzkoppen and '
Signor Panizzardi if they consented to
come. .. Â
y. I'aieologue said that while M. La- I
bori's request appeared quite logical and I
just there were diplomatic considerations |
which made it Inadmissible for the gov- |
ernment io take such initiative as was
proposed by counsel for the defense.
Colonel Jouaust said the court would J
decide the matter later and meanwhile
proceed with the taking of evidence.
The first witness called to-day was Re- j
porter Bassett, whom the Matin sent to j
London to interview Major Esterhazy,
Th.% witness deposed that Esterhazy con
fessed to him that he wrote the bordereau
Voider order* from Colonel Sandherr, who^
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 6, 1899,
was the <"'hief of the Secret Intelligence
Bureau. The order Esterhazy receive I
was to catch the traitor at th^ general
headquarters, who Esterhazy afterward
said was Captain Dreyfus. Major Car
riere here burst out with an extraordinary
protest apainst Major Esterhazy's insinu
ations against Colonel Sandherr.
"I protest," he crier], "in the name an-i
memory of Colonel Sandherr, against the
insinuations introduced against him!"
M. Labor! ignored this protest, which he
styled a ridiculous pretension.
M. Labor! < ailed upon General Roget to
testify in regard to letters he hart receiv
ed from Major Esterhazy since the open-
Ing of this trial. General Roget to-<l:iy
looked the fih.ist of his former assertive
self, iiis face was careworn and show d
little of that righting spirit which flrÂ«rt
characterized his appearance upon the
stage, He replied that he only open- d
one letter from Major Esterhazy. which
he had forwarded to Colonel Jouaust.
General Roget added that he had declined
to rect i\ â¢â  i>t her letters.
M. Labor! then asked Colonel Jouaust
to have the letters read. Colonel Jouaust
at first declined, but M. Labor! Insisted
so firmly thai Colonel Jouaust, after
wrangling v while, gave way and consent
ed that the letters should be read later.
Colonel Jouaust explained that he oppos
ed the reading of the letters because they
only contained personal attacjes upon va
rious i>;irties and would only lead to a
prolongation of the trial.
Geneial Roget then read the one Ester
hnzy letter which tie admitted having
opi tied In this leter Major Esterhazy
said he could not prove the existence of
the alleged syndicate organized in the in
terest of Dreyfus and complained that
the general staff had refused to give him
a fair hearing.
M. Labor! then put a series of questions
Intended to bring out the fact that the
gem ral staff had made use of Esterhazy
even after he was known tn he unreliable.
General Roget said he had not consid
er-! Major Esterhazy' S avowals to be of
anj value.
M. Laborl sought to question General
Roget more doselj on his statement that
none of the generals of the genera] staff
had any relations with Major Esterhazy,
but Colonel Jouaust declined to allow
further discussion. Tnin led to another
scene between the president of the court
martial and counsel for the defense, M.
Labor! declaring that General Roget, who
came more as a public prosecutor than
as a witness, refused to reply to probing
questions,
M. Demange asked General Roget his
opinion of Major Esterhazy.
"I have an absolute conviction," replied
General Roget. amid cries of "Oh" from
the audience, "that Major Esterrftzy is a
stranger to treason."
General Roget then delivered a short
discourse in reply to the statement that
M de la Fond Lamotte on Saturday that
the phrase in the bordereau, "I am going
to the maneuvers," showed that Dreyfus
could not be the author of the bordereau.
General Roget maintained that Lamotte
was wrong.
Captain Dreyfus in a clear voice em
phatically Insisted that the circular of
May 17, 1894, announcing that the proba
tioners could not go to the maneuvers,
was written in the clearest language,
â¢which the court would see if it were read.
He reiterated that he had never asked to
go to the maneuvers, lor he was abso
lutely convinced that such a request
would not be granted.
M. Defies, a reporter for the Temps,
testified that he saw Major Esterhazy in
London and that the latter confessed he
was the author of the bordereau. The
witness added that he raised the question
of the letters of Mme. Boulance and
brought away the impression that Ester
hazy wrote the "Uhlan" letter.
M. Trarieux. formerly Minister of Jus
tice', was next called. He made a long
deposition in favor of Dreyfus, reviewing
the history of the case and his own part
in connection therewith. M. Trarieux is
an excellent speaker, with a good pres
ence. His deposition closed the public
session. He made a very telling speech,
describing how his original belief in the
guilt of Dreyfus was first shaken and
then completely changed to conviction of
innocence by subsequent developments
and the noble conduct of M. Scheurer-
Kestner, formerly vice president of the
Senate. The letters exchanged between
General Gonse and Lieutenant Colonel
Picquart also strengthened his conviction.
M. Trarieux spoke of the machinations
against Picquart and said he accused no
body. He believed, however, that the
chiefs were deceived. M. Trarieux re
counted a conversation with a foreign
Embassador, who declared in a tone of
the greatest sincerity that Dreyfus never
hud relations with him nor with any offi
cer of his country, while, the Embassa
dor added, he possessed documents prov
ing the guilt of Major Esterhazy.
M. Trarieux delivered a very impres
sive speech, recalling the execution of the
English Admiral P.yng on the charge of
treason who was afterward found to have
been unjustly condemned. ML Trarieux
said that Frenchmen might well dread to
have such a blood stain upon their his
tory as, through the execution of Ad
miral Byng, mars the history of England.
M. Trarieux said General Kuget and Cap
tain Cuignet were wrong in the conclusion
that they had drawn from the correspond
ence of Agrents "A" and "B" that Drey
fus was guilty. The former Minister of
Justice declared in an emphatic tone
which made a deep impression upon his
hearers that no parallel ought to be
drawn between a model officer like Drey
fus and Major Esterhazy. who had not
even the soul of a Frenchman.
M Trarieux, on alluding to the bor
dereau, was interrupted by Major Car
riere, who said that while he opposed
direct official application to foreign Gov
ernments for documents mentioned in the
bordereau, yet i!' by a side wind the doc
um< nts could be produced be certainly
would be personally much pleased i
This is practically an invitation to Ger
many to voluntarily communicate the
documents in question.
At the conclusion of M. Trarieux's tes
timony, which apparently had made an
impression on the judges, the court-mar
tial went behind closed doors and exam
ined the secret espionage dossier.
The court also deliberated on M. La.
bori's request that application be made to
Germany for the documents descrihed in
the bordereau. The decision was unani
mously reached to reject the application
on the ground that the court was incom
petent to invite the Government to take
diplomatic steps to obtain the documents
in question. It was also decided to hear
M. Cernuschl behind closed doors to-mor
row.
CASEY SWEARS HOWARD
PLANNED GREEN'S MURDER
Continued from First Pasre.
child did not remain long in this coun
try after their consorts had formulated
their daring scheme. The police have
discovered the very interesting infor
mation that Mrs. Kelly and Augustus
Howard had the unusual faculty of
banking at the same houses and using
the same safe deposits. In this way
another connection between Howard
and the rest of the gang is established,
but it was early in the campaign that
Mrs. Kelly and Mrs. Adams found it
expedient to leave here for Sydney, and
on February 24, 1599, they departed on
th<' steamr Moana.
As already indicated one of the most
daring and atrocious crimes planned by
the conspirators was the planning of
the murder of Willard F. Green, which
is charged by the police to Augustus
Howard. The most damaging evidence
against Howard in this connection is
j furnished by John Casey, who is now in
the City Prison. Casey declared to a
Call reporter last night that he had re
ceived $5000 from Augustus Howard to
murder Green. In support of this alle
gation there is the established evidence
that shortly before the Alameda sailed
from this port on March 22 Howard
took $10,000 in gold which belonged to
him from the safe of the Palace Hotel.
Casey says that Green was pointed out
to him and to Kelly at the Palace Hotel
and the compact was made to murder
Green on the downward trip of the
Alameda. The money, so Casey says,
was taken to the dock by Howard In
a hack and there delivered to Murphy.
The three men went on board and then,
just as the ship was leaving the dock,
jumped ashore.
In outline these facts constitute the
criminal history of Aug-ustus Howard
and h!s confederates, and there is
every reason to believe that most of the
men will escape conviction for their
crimes. They certainly will do so for
the offenses committed in the Antip
odes. The Mexican authorities do not
want Casey, as they have no definite
evidence against him. The American
authorities do not want Kelly, as they
are in the same predicament as the
Mexican people. The officers of Aus
tralia and New Zealand want neither
Casey nor Kelly, as the expense at
tached to the extradition of Butler has
made them chary of renewing the ex
periment. But when Howard is caught
there is absolute certainty that he will

There is an unusually charming effect

"Jackie" Casey, with his many aliases,
appeared before Judge Mogan yesterday
on his preliminary examination on the
charge of grand larceny by trick and de
vice. The Judge, after hearing the testi
mony and arguments of counsel, reserved
his decision till this afternoon at 2
Felix' Bloch, the tailor on Sutter street,
testified that Casey, under the name of J.
Angus, had, prior to May 15, obtained a
pair of trousers and a suit of clothes
which he paid for. On May 15 he ordered
another suit and an overcoat, and one day
sent a messenger boy with a note that he
was sick and to send the articles by the
messenger and he would pay for them,
but he had not done so. They were valued
Charles Kushler, who was then a cutter
with Bloch, but has since been dis
charged, testified to having sent the goods
by the messenger, who did not return
with the money and was believed to have
been a "dummy." He was asked if he
had ever asked Bloch for authority to
send the clothes to Casey without pay
ment, and he said he had, but Bloch made
no reply. He was authorized to give
credit to customers who had an open ac
cont. Blnch denied both statements.
It was also shuwn by Detectives T. B.
Gibson and Ellis that two days after
Casey got the suit and overcoat he left
the lodging house at 911 Bush street where
ho had been stopping and disappeared.
They found the goods in his possession,
but 'he had changed the buttons and had
destroyed the labels. He told them that,
he had bought the suit in Sydney and the !
overcoat in London. When arrested he
pave his true name as John Casey. The
clothing was positively identiued by
Bloch and his cutter.
Ex-Judge Louderback for the prosecu
tion argued that Casey went to Bloch's
with a felonious intent and by trick and
device obtained the goods, which was cor
roborated by his denial to the detectives
and the alterations he had made in the
garments.
Attorney Collins argued that it was to
all intent's and purposes a case for the
civil courts, and the Judge said he would
render his decision this afternoon at 2

To-night's programme of special feat

dicated wonderful adaptability and su
perior training.
The entertainment by the musical Wil
lards was the most pleasing and enjoyable
of to-night's features. They played on
five different kinds of musical instru
ments, the character of which is unfamil
iar with most people. There was a cake
walk by Eugene Coffin and Lola Frosl
of San Jose, who have won honors in their
city. This was followed by more acro
batic feats by the Schenck brothers and
ladder pyramids by the junior athletes.
The programme concluded with a trapeze

twenty-mile course, ten miles to wind

ward mark I minutes and S3 seconds
ahead of the Defender, besides making up
a handicap at the start of 31 seconds. On
the run home, with spinnakers set, she
gained 3^ seconds over her rival. The
winds was about eight knots from the
Boutheast-by-aouth at the start, and
freshened steadily as the afternoon wore
on, so that the boats finished in a twelve

offered by Colonel William God!;-. of j
Providence.
The Columbia this morning put on a new
n:ains;iil of lighter weight canvas than
any she had previously used, and it was to
test the new cloth that the race was
Bailed. She also bad a new forestaysaJl

was the finest fit the Columbia has ever
had. It is a little lorger at the hoist than j

longer on the boom or gaff than the other. 1

Champions of Atlantic Seaboard
Easily Dispose of California
Talent at Dei Monte.
Special Dispatch to The Call. .
DEL MONTE, Sept. s.â "The West is the
West and the East is the East." and the
twain will not meet for some time as far
as tennis Is concerned. There is a gap be
tween the playing of the Eastern and the
Western champions th;it can neither be
filled nor bridged. The time may come
when the Pacific Coast champions may
put their Eastern rivals on the plane of
an equal contest, but that time is not yet j
here.
At the opening of the National Tourna j
nient at Del Monte to-day the pride an.i j
flower of Atlantic championship tourna
ments found the westerners "easy game" j
for their strung racket-wielding arms. But
one local court dtvotee proved metal !
worthy of their steel and he was Sumner j
Hardy. Hardy won the single Western j
victory and ma .â â¢ Malcolm D. Whitman, j
the champion of the United States, drink 1
stimulants before their match was j
finished.
Eight matches were played, seven of
which placed new feathers in the belts of !
the Eastern quartet. The tournament be
gan Its course about 11 o'clock, when !
Robert N. Whitney and M. I). Whitman |
shed their coats to begin action. Whit- j
man won the match, 6â3, 4â6, 6â2, 6âl. |
The second set was appropriated by
Whitney, who seemed Infused with a
righting bacillus of the tennis order, for
he ever played such an excellent game
before. His good exhibition proved fruit
less, however, against the man whose con
sistent and accurate playing, Infallible
strokes and superb eye has made him the
greatest tennis player in America. Whit
man's scientific, cool, calculating and per- j
feet tennis in the morning was a revela
tion to the spectators thai lined the
courts.
More vigorous, brilliant and dashing is :
AT THE DEL MONTE TENNIS TOURNAMENT.
Dwight Davis, second on the list of the
country's tennis kiii^H. He smashed the
with force enough to punch holes in
the courts. From the time he begins play
he ia at his rran with a B wish and banp,
and never lets up. even fur a breathing
space. In three easy bets he took the
measure of George Whitney, who was ex
- in one court, while "Brother"
Robert was breathing his last on an
other..
The Western champion. George Whit
ney, was not himself to-day. None of that
Ufic playing which dial d him
at the last San Rafael tournament was
exhil Ited. Davis' force and vi^or, dash
and war horse charges left George Whit
ney dumfounded.
Ana Whitney was not the only food for
Davis' appetite for In the
afternoon he waded right through Sam

6âl.
Western hopes and anticipations vrorÂ«
irketable v terday, but there
is not enough â  ther to raise a
now. Whitman was conceded a
winner and Davis a probable one. but
the locai men counted on certain victories
ovt-r Ward and Wright. It wus another
on of fond hopes that went a glim
mering. Ward won both his matches, de
: g Sam Hardy this mr.rmng and;
X I crt N. Whitney in the afternoon.
"Weil, if we can't beat Ward, we can
beat Wright." said ihr- local men,
Sumner Hardy did beat him, but George
Whitney fell into an abysmal pit when
he r:if r the youngest of the visitors, hut !
one set being his portion. In this match,
as in that with Davis, Whitney was not I
himself, astonishing friends and foe by j
his erratic playing.
Every guest In the hotel and many from I

tournament was in the nature of a con- J

the afternoon he appeared again, this j

four. The score of the next game was

man pulled himself together and won the !

Hardy, with the s< ore "f six games to
three. Then Whitman braced again, win- !
ning the third set, 6 â l, but Hardy forced '
him to play until the perspiration rolling

HOHENZOLLERN
FIRST FOR THE
FLASH STAKES
Defeat of Mt McGregor II at
Sacramento Puts a Crimp
in Many Bank Rolls.
Special Pi=ratch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. s.â The big crowd
at Agricultural Tark to-day witnessed
some gr< at sport and many close and ex
citing finishes, but the speculative ele
meni wis badly worsted in the battle
with the books. Beginning with Dakan
D, the top-heavy choice for the two-year
old pacing stake, every favorite right
down the line contributed toward sepa
rating the talent from its coin. Neeretta
was looked upon in the nature of a finch
â¢;â¢ 2:16 trot, but the dilatory tactics
j of Brooks enabled H. Hogoboom to land
: honest-going Our Lucky winner in two
straight heats.
Then followed in the running events the
i crushing defeats of Aft. McGregor 11,
favorite for the Flash stake; The Scot
! and Libertine. On the latter horse the
b ks were besieged with oom. until they
finally turned their Blates toward ihe
walL
The weather was warm and balmy and
the track somewhat faster tor tin- har
nesa horses than on the opening day.
There were no perceptible hitches in the
programme, the crowd leaving lor borne
el . 6 o'clock.
Promptly at 1:30 the judges' bell tapped
out the three starters in me baby racing ;
event. In Dakan D, v shapely bay young- j
ster by Athadon, "Farmer" Owen of
i resno was supposed to possess another!
i Joe Wheeler and 3 to 6 \va.- laid against
the two-year-old. Volita, the Santa Kuan !
â â¢: Farm's candidate, was well sup
ported at even money, with Waldstein Jr.
the ra:ik outsider. They shot away to a
perfi i t start and Owen led the way with
the favorite until well :;ito the stretch,
where the pace told and the little fellow I
left his feet. Abies, behind Volita, then
had a lazj drive of it home, winning by
three lengths in 2:H. Waldstein
was not a contender.
The odds now shifted about, Votita en
plai c of honor In the books.
Once more "Farmer" Owens set a wet
sail with his youngster, but choppy
weather struck him again at the stretch
I turn, and, taking the l<--ad, \ olita won
I about as she pleased in 2:28%. Jn this
heat Waldstein Jr. grew very leg weary,
getting the distance Hag.
The downfall of the crack black mare
Neeretta In the 2:10 trot, two in three, was
wholly unexpected. The field was a largo j
one, and as the lavorite drew near tne i
outside position the wise ones concluded i
to play Our Lucky, the pole horse, for
the "opener." The latter closed favorite, j
while the price against Neeretta drifted
from evens to ?, to 2. The move was a
Wise one, for after Sable Francis had led

laid away among the tail enders until
striking the stretch, where the mare came
fast, nnishing a close third. Daymont and
Sue were distanced.
With her improved position In the heat
to foil >w. and her recent victories at Oak
land and Santa Rosa fresh in mind, the
talent now unleaded 'on Xeeretta at odds
of 3 to 0. Our Lucky's price remained at
6 to 5. In this heat Driver Hogoboom
showed himself to be a "teamster" above
the average. Rushing Our Lucky along,
he was first at the quarter by nearly a
length, trailed by Bonsaline. Neeretta and
Mamie Riley. When the half was reached
Sable Francis had dropped out and the
favorite moved up a peg. Turning into
the stretch. Hogoboom went wide with
Lucky, carrying Nperetta out into the
deep going. It cupped out under the lat-
I ter and Our Lucky again won cleverly by
I a length in 2:14%. Mamie Riley was a
: fair third.
The track was now given up to the run
i ners. Thi- Flash stake at six furlongs at-
I tracted a varied assortment of speed to
: the post, with the Burns & Waterhouse
t entry Mount McGregor II carrying 107
I pounds a 3 to 5 favorite. Of the other
starters, Novia and February were in
trusted with the most coin. To the
Btr< teh it was a two-horse race, the
favorite and Bamboulia setting: a heart
breaking clip. The latter snapped first. )
and a furlong from home Jones on Novia
tried to pasa McGregor next the rail. He I
was cut off. and while extricating him- I

winning hands down. The first choice I
lasted long enough to beat Novia a neck !
for th" place. February was well played, i
but Tulfett managed tn gf-t almost left at i
the post, not -in infrequent trick of his.
The winner was but slightly backed.
In the two-year-old scramble at five and
one-half furlongs, the j)ast clever pr-r- '
formances of Bathos were overlooked, the
big money going into the books on The |
Scot, with little Walsh up, at odds of 3 to \
5. If The Scot was possessed of any speed.
Walsh was utterly unable to make him â¢
â bow it, for he was nevr among the:
leaders. Duffy, astride Bathos, bustled
the Montana colt away in front, and,
stalling off the challenge of Midity in the
run to the stand, earned the verdict by a
neck. The last-named filly, a daughter ;
of Midlothian, will evidently bear watch
ing. Eddie Jones, on the BufToon, took
show honors.
The concluding number on the card, a
peven-furlong run, was a fierce betting !
affair. In the overnight betting, Alaria
was quoted at 3 to 1, but the tip on her
roved so contagious that at the track i

MEN WHO SAVED
THE CLUB ARE
NOW IGNORED
Nominating Committee of Bay
City Wheelmen Make a Ciea-
Sweep of the Old
Officers.
The nominating committee appointed at
the recent annual meeting of the Bay City
Wheelmen, met last night to select a
board of eleven rectors for the ensuing
; year. The committee la composed of
seven membersâ Henry L. Day Frederick
Boeckmann. W. 11. Welch, Benjamin Ray
naud. "Waiter McDonald, Theodore C,
Dodge and Thomas S. Hall. They got
down to business quickly, and, in spite of
the fact that the past year has been th.;
most successful the club has enjoyed
since 1592, proceeded to oust the entire
preceding board of eleven, with the ex
ception of four. The nominating commit
tee then elected three of its own person
nel to serve on the new board â Messrs.
Bopckmann, McDonald and Day, though
it must be said to Mr. Day's credit that
he urgent!v requested that his name be
left â .:'. The entire board was finally se
lected, as follows: Frank 11. Kerrigan.
Frank H. Waiters Jr., Archie Reid, Henry
L. Day, Frank W. Smith. George Star.g
i enberger. Frederick Boeckmann Jr., Wal
ter McDcnald. Austin Kanzee, S. B. Vin
cent end Edward D. Mendell.
It will be a matter of extreme regret
among the better class of members of the
club that President E. F. Fahrbach, Sec
retary E. N. Creigh and Captain A. J.
Menne, who managed the club so success
fully during the past year as to take I*.
out of debt, put money In th bank and
increase the membership 10 per cent,
should have been overlooked by the nom
inating committee in its wild pursuit
for office: but it is only another example
of the lack of gratitude the members h-r. â¢
always shown toward the club's most
ardent workers.
There is still one hope left for the club,
and that is that Henry L. Day will consent
to serve as president. Under his guidance
I its affairs would run along smoothly, but
! it is certain that neither Kerrigan. Wal
! ters nor Reid of the old board will take
the office-, and none of the new members
1 are suited for the position. The club's af
| fairs have apparently reached a crisis.
The Bay Citj, Wheelmen held a five-
J mile handicap tandem road race last Sun
i day from San Leandro to Haywards, in

rice Lowenstein, John H. Grady, L'
F. Bartlett, P. H. McCarthy and A. i
Thompson, comprising the committee '.
seven recently appointed to select Demu
cratic nominees for the Board of Super
visors, met last night at the Columbian
tuilding. The session was slightly In
formal and in no sense secret. Several as
pirants for nomination, among them Au
gust Tillman. P. M. Weilin, I. L. Houser
and Clitus Barbour, attended. The com
mittee has not yet determined whether
only eighteen names or a larger list will
be presented to the convention. It is
noted 'hat. there is no rush of leading
business men for the honor of serving the
city on the Board of Supervisors. Special
effort may be required to get the most de
sirable men to accept nomination.
â r.el William J. Bryan of Nebraska,
accompanied by Colonel \V. W. Foote of
California, will arrive in the city this
forenoon. Preparations have been made
by the Iroquois Club and other Demo
cratic societies to give Colonel Bryan a
rousing reception. The c.vent has awak
ened much interest in Democratic po
litical circles, as neariy allSof the states
men of that faith predict that Bryan will
again be the nominee of his party for the
Presidency. Colonel Bryan will address
the people at Woodward's Pavilion this
evening.

LAST YEAR'S ROLLS STUFFED
TWO NEW SCHOOLS ADDED AND
FOUR ABOLISHED.
Department Has Four More Teachers
a Ye.-.r Ago. but Eighteen
Are IT a assigned and Draw
No Salaries.
Superintendent of Schools R. H. Web
ster filed his annual report with the
Board of Supervisors yesterday. The re
port contains a vast amount of informa
tion concerning the School Department of !
this city, and the facts are arranged in i
a remarkably clear and comprehensive
form. The report shows, among other
things, that San Francisco now conducts
but ninety schools, whereas las year the
number was ninety-two. The change in ;
these figures is the result of abolishing I
four evening schools and the establish- j
ment of one new grammar and one new
primary schcol.
The total enrollment this year is 45.570,
an apparent decrease from the enroll- j
ment of a year ago. but the stuffing of
the rolls by the old board, or with it* !
sanction, was so notorious that the com
parison signifies nothing. Again, the fig
ures give the total number of pupils be
longing to the schools last year as 0T,225.
with an average daily attendance of 3.5,11(5.
This year the total number of pupils :
actually attending school is S>.lC*l. and the j
average daily attendance is G6.?40.
The average monthly wages of the men
teachers in the grammar and primary
grades is 5134 and for women teachers
S7Â£; in the high schools the average for
men is $!â¢Â£ and for women $121. Four
principals of grammar schools of eighteen
classes receive $?Â» each per month, and |
four high school principals receive $250
each per month. There are 1015 regular
teachers with classes in the department;
thirty-six substitute day teachers, five
substitute evening school teachers and
eighteen teachers who are una^signed md
draw no salaryâ a total of 1074 as com
pared with 10TO a year ago. During the i
year two teachers resigned, â '-â  dree
were dismissed, fourteen were dropped "
because their positions were abolished.
two were placed on the retired list and
two died, cringing the total number ia
the department down to IW7. From June
30, 1898, to June SO. I*9o. sixty-seven new
teachers were elected, making the total
number of teachers of ail classes <includ-
Ing the eighteen unassigned teachers) up
to 1074.

FRENNA'S COOLNESS
SURPRISED A WITNESS
PRELIMINARY HEARING OF J. F.
TURNERS MURDERER.
Four Witnesses Examined, but Noth
ing of Importance Added to
What Is Already Known.
The ; reiiminary examination of Joseph
P. Ftt-nr.a. charged with th< murder of
James ' 1 real estate agent, in
the Cr - r lilding, was resumed before
:ay, Attorney
:;ns appei- --^cial
tor I Attor â  mer for the
Nothing â¢ â¢ was
â  - â¢
r testified to having
been called from his office on the fifth
floor to examine Turner's body.. When he
reached the body Turner gasped once or
twice and died.
Walter J. Andrews, a manufacturer's
agent, whose office is on the third floor,
near the elevator, testified that he was
dictating letters to his stenographer when
he heard a shot, followed by four others.
The first four ere in rapid succession,
but there was a slight pause between the
fourth and fifth. He went out of his
office and saw the defendant standing in
the corridor, and Turner or. the floor.
lying on his face. Some one turned the
body over.
John R. Keefe, superintendent of the
building, testified that he heard the five
shots, and when he reached the scene
there was a cloud of smoke. Turner was
on the floor and the defendant was stand
ing near the body. The defendant was so
very cool that witness looked around to
see who had done the shooting, never sus
pecting him. The defendant said: "I did
ft to defend myself." Witness ran for Dr.
Spencer, and on his return saw the de
fendant give a pistol to Policeman Ross.
Archibald 'all urn, whose office la in
room 27 with A. B. Paul, the witness who
testified on Saturday, testified practically
the same as Paul. Witness asked the
defendant, as he pointed to Turner's pros
trate body. "Who is that?" and the de
fendant replied: "That is Turner; he
said he was going to k:ii me and I had to
protect myself." Defendant asa him to i
keep 'a letter for him. which was intro
duced in evidence, and proved to be a
letter from a surveyor ImLassen County
as to certain lands being in Shasta Coun
ty owing to a change in a recent survey
of the boundary between the two coun
ties. In cross-examination he said that
defendant had been in the habit of coming
to his office to see Mr. Gregory in !
the mornings. from 9 to 9:30 o'clock. The
examination will be continued this morn
ing.

BEAR FLAGS ARE
ASTIR FOR SONS
OF CALIFORNIA
Santa Cruz Decked in
Gay Attire.
DUBOCE A GUEST OF HONOR
CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS WILL
BE IN ATTENDANCE.
Transportation Committee of tha Na
tive Sons Makes an Important
Change in the Leaving of
Saturday's Special.
Colonel Victor Duboce. command
ing the First California Volunteers.
Major Boxton of that regiment and
Major Bice, commanding the Cali
fornia Heavy Artillery, â¢will be the
guests of honor of the executive
committee of the citizens of Santa
Cruz during the celebration of the
Native Sons of the Golden West in
that city. The invitation, which was
brought to this city by Milton Besse,
grand marshal of the order, was con
veyed to the officers at the Presidio
yesterday by L. F. Byington. presi
dent of the joint committee, and
James P. Dockery, marshal of the
San Francisco parlors. Several hun
dred of the volunteers have also sig
nified their intention of witnessing
the State's big birthday party, and
will leave on Friday in a special
train.
If Grand President Frank Mattlson and
Grand Marshal Milton Besse are to be be
lieved everyone in Santa Cruz has quit
his usual occupation and gone to getting
gloriously ready for the Native Sons. All
sorts of red. white and blue tales of what
Santa Cruz and her hospitable citizens
intend to do when the big special train
gets In there on the evening of the Bth,
have been floating this way since the ex
citement started, but nothing in the way
of a definite announcement had been made
until Grand Marshal Besse, who Is also
Sheriff of the County, got up here Wed
nesday night and declared himself. The
sale of round-trip tickets since that time
has doubled Itself.
The Santa Cruzans have not taken into
their calculations that the Natives are
going to provide a considerable part of
their own entertainment but have gone
ahead Just as though they were expected
to do the whole thing. They have Just
finished dumping several thousand dol
lars Into the mouth of the San Lorenzo
and the result is that that stream has
been converted into a lake which, after
it has been strung over with thousands
of vari-colored Incandescent lights, will
be lie scece oX lie big water carnival I
which la scheduled to take place on Mon
day night next.
Just who is to be queen of the carnival
is not yet determined; Miss Anna Lm
scott, the beautiful daughter of J. A.
Llnscott. Superintendent of the Schools of
the county, and Miss May Baldwin,
daughtet of L. K. Baldwin, the Santa
Cruz banker, and a prominent Native
Daughter, are running very close together
in the lead and only the last of the week
will teU the story.
By Friday evening Pacific avenue, the
main street, will be aflutter with flags
and eav bunting. Under the direction of
R. H. Pringie, chairman of the decora
tion committee, and Enoch Alzina. that
w rk has already begun . â  ey 13
being spared upon It. Carl Kratzenstein,
~rnan of the accommodation commit
u wired ar. assurance to this city
that no native need cast about for an
empty dry-BO" â > xp r vacant lamp post;
will be rooms for everyone and no
danger of a repetition of the unhap: x
perience of some of those who did not
take their lodgings with them to Santa
Crux's first carnival. The work of getting
guests to their rooms will fall upon Mr.
Kratzenstein and H. J. Bias, chairman of
the reception committee. The city has
been divided into eight districts and a
force of small I to act as guides
in each section. The financing of the
ne has faHen largely on the should
â¢' Mayor Lamb. W. D. Haslam. cash
ier of the City Bank, and L. Foster Young
of the Bank of Santa Cruz County.
The programme at the Santa Cruz end
of the line - ' â  *â¢* arranged is as tol-

the Venetian Water Carnival on the
Lagunlta.
Lewis F. Byington and Grand Marshal
Docker\- spent yesterday in closing with
lifroad company final arrangements
; "- trans] rtation. Th-ir visit to the b!g
building resulted in one important change
the notice of which every
orie v* tends going to Santa Cruz oil
Saturday morning should cutout and paste ; '
in his hat, or on his valise, or somewhere I
else where he will see it often enough to
bear it in mind. All of the posters that ;
have been issued, and the tickets them- '
selves, state that the special train on '
Saturday morning will leave at 7:43 '
o'clock. The hour has been changed to
6:43. just one hour earlier, and no matter
what the posters and tickets say the train
will leave at that time.
This change was made necessary by the
fact that the parade in Santa Cruz will
form at 11 o'clock, fully an hour before
the morning' train would have arrived. !
The revised schedule is as follows:
September Bâ From San Francisco: All I
trains, broad and narrow gauge, also spe- '
cial train from ferry landing at S:3O p. m.
From Oakland and Aiameda: All trains
narrow gauge, also special train from
Fourteenth and Franklin streets at S:3G
p. m.
September &â From San Francisco: Via .
narrow gauge. 6:45 and 8:15 a. m. ; via
broad guage. Third Street Depot, 9 a. m.
From Oakland and Alameda: Morning
narrow gauge trains.
ATHENS IN LINE.
Alam?da's Baby Parlor Prom- j
ises Something New and
Novel,
Athens Parlor. No. US, N. 8. G. W., is !
the youngest parlor in Aiameda county.
At the last celebration the parlor created i
1 a decided sensation by the novel features j
it introduced in the parade, and the boys '
of Athens were complimented on the fine
appearance they made. This year they I
do not propose to be outshone by any of â¢
the local parlors and will be recognized
in the parade by reason of the novelties I
they propose to have in line. From the i
enthusiasm manifested the committee
feels that the entire membership will be
in line.
The following costume has been sub- I
mitted by the committee for the consid- j
eration of^he members. White duck coat !
and trousers, white golf cap. blue vestlet
and blue bow tie. The members will also
wear with these a white shirt, standing
collar and white shoes. Each member
will carry a white parasol with poppy rib
bon trimmings. The regulation poppy
color badge will also be worn. A band of
I twelve pieces will accompany the parlor
I to Santa Cruz and help entertain their
I many friends at their headquarters at the
I Pacific Ocean House.
The Ninth of September Committee
from Athens Parlor consists of J. N. I '
Fogarty, chairman, and Benjamin F. '
Woolner and F. A. Losh, and are working '
zealously to make Athens' part in thÂ« 1
celebration a success. (

STEEL FAMINE
AFFECTS NAVY
A Marked Advance in
Prices Noted.
SHIP - BUILDING IS DELAYED
CONTRACTORS UNABLE TO FIN
ISH THEIR WORK.
Several Firms Make Applications for
Extension of Time and New
Bids Exceed CongTess'
Limit.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Sept. s.â The r.avy is
beginning to feel seriously the effect- of
the heavy advance in the steel market.
To-day the shipbuilding firm of Laily &
Co. of Boston asked for a year's exten
- : from October 1 in building the tor
pedo-boat? Delong ar.d Blakeley. now un
der construction in their yards. The Nlx
â¢ - at F";zab<cthport. N. J.. who are
; building the torpedo-boats Nicholson and
j O'Brien, have stated to the naval officials
! that it is impossible for them to get forg
-- ... - : its and :â¢ Is expected that
: they will ask for an extension. There are
, twelve of the torpedo-boats and destroy
; ers under construction in various yards,
: and all are affected by the "steel famine"
i and the heavy prices, so it is expected
j that extensions will be asked on all these
craft.
The prospect is that the bids on the six
protected cruisers to be opened on No
-r i will be much higher than was
expected when the appropriation for them
was made. It is roughly estimated
that the steel in hulls has advanced
it 50 per cent, in engines 40 per cent, in
I boilers 3>> per cent, and the average ad
vance on all classes of steel used in ships
Is about 35 per < - I
The engineering bureau has also felt the
advance, not only in increased prices but
in an inability to get material and build
ings inside the limit rixed by Congress.
On a recent purchase of electric cranes
the advance was found to be about 25 per
cent. In the contracts for material for
â¢wer plant at New York the increase
i ranged fr â¡ I 60 per cent, the latter
applying to engines.
The bureau of yards and docks is un
able to proceed with a number of building
ecta at navy-yards and stations owing
to the advance in ste*J. This is the case
as to the large buildings at the New York
N ivy-yard, all the bids being in ex
the amount allowed by Congress. The
: same is true of the ordnance shops at the
L^agrie Island yard. Philadelphia, and of
ral lesser projects.
Civil Engineer Cunningham of the bu
reau of yards and docks says structural
â tee! has advanced 100 per cent and in
some cases 390 per rent. Admiral O'Neil
of the bureau of ordnance says ordnance
is about the only branch not affected by
:~e in steel. Gunmetal is used only
by the army and navy, so that there is
no commercial demand to send up the
prices.
COME TO REVIEW THE
ARCHITECTURAL VIEWS
HEER JUNGHAEXDEX IS HERE
FROM BERLIN.
The Famous Expert Emphasizes the
Importance of the Competition
for the University of Cali
fornia Buildings.
The interest which the international
competition for the Phebe Hearst plan of
the University of California arouses in
America as in Europe ie manifested by
the presence In this city of Herr Max
Junehaendel, the architect and author
from Berlin. He came in compliance to
the request of leading European art re
views to criticize the results of the com
petition. Herr Junghaendel has perhaps
traveled more than any other architect
and has seen nearly every architectural
creation of importance which Europe, the
Orient and America have produced. He
had to see them with the eye of a critic,
having to select the best for the costly
works he edited and which, for the care
ful selection and artistic reproduction of
the objects, are considered the foremost
of their class. Herr Junghaendel is at
present engaged in the preparation of a
large work on the achievements of mod
ern American architecture, which is in
great demand in Europe and which he
believes will be the most interesting one
he ever edited. He gained his spurs by
the excellent criticisms he wrote twelve
years ago on the international competi
tion for the facade of the Milan Cathe
dral. With reference to the present com
petition, he said yesterday:
"As an architect I am naturally highly
Interested in it. There is no doubt that
this competition is the greatest one to
which architects of all the world ever
have been invited. It is as much the
magnitude of its design to create the larg
est and most perfect university in the
world as the unusual generosity of its
execution which make this competition
for surpass any other one. Never be
fore were architects confronted with such
a gigantic scheme and had to puzzle with
THE ZMPOBIUM.

such a vast array of buildings and re
quirements. It was surely unique. that
the prize-winners of the preliminary com
petition were invited to come to San
Francisco at the expense of .the origina
tor in order to study the site and the
local building conditions before making
the more definite plans for the final com
petition. It is furthermore unparalleled
in the history of architectural competi
tions that the leading architects of Eng
land. France and Germany, as members
of the jury, are also brought half way
around the globe in all possible comfort
in order to be treated here in a more
than royal manner. That is simply grand.
That shows American enterprise and
greatness of conception, generosity and
hospitality in a glorious way. More than
any achievement on the fields of war can
this peaceful event contribute to alter the
queer ideas of America which are still
current, even among the better conducted
classes of the Old World.
'"It is the purpose of my stay in Amer
ica and of my intended work on Amer
ican architecture to show to the world the
great achievements on the fields of peace.
It is. therefore, in my line to pay espe
cial attention to this competition. I sel
dom write for journals, but in this case
I thought it to the interest of my profes
sion, to the honor of Californiaâ nay.
Americaâ to emphasize the importance of
this competition. Quite a number of lead
ing reviews eagerly expect my reports
and criticisms. I hope that my own ex
pectations will be fulfilled and that this
competition will bring forward a plan
which may fully reward the great exer
tions and generous expenditures made to
create it. I sincerely wish that an Amer
ican architectâ Germans are not in itâ
may carry off the prize, and that in the
at a future hi? first creations can be re
produced in my work as the beet exam
ples of modern American architecture."

NEW ENGLAND BIMETALLISTS.
PROVIDENCE, Rhode Island, is the scene of
the first meeting of the New England Bimetal
lic League, and the public will learn with
something of surprise that the chief of the New Eng
. â  . ts â  â  â  Illinois, Tillman of
S.-r.th Carolina, Lentz of Ohio and Judge Tarvin oi
Kentucky. Those men at any rate were thi
lings of the first day. and
it would appear, therefore, that the Bimetallic i
id enough New Englanders to
speak in its name and welcome visitors to the con
ference.
Another curious feature of the occasion i- that the
first meeting was held on Sunday, a day that New
nd dec -rum sets apart for churchgoing and
meditation upon treasures laid up in heaven. A po
litical assembly on that day may be held in New
England, but hardly by natives who have a due re
ir tradition and the respect of their neighbors.
Finally, to complete the surprises of this extraordin
ary league, the convention gathered not in a hall
where it could discuss grave questions with dignity
and sei but in a certain resort called Cres
cent Park, where, as we are duly informed, the voices
of the orators were frequently lost in the blaring of
brass bands and the noise of "money-making at
â  -is."
Despite the surprising nature of these features of
nference, it may be they are but natural and
perhaps inevitable attendants upon such a gathering
in that part of the country. A clamor lor frei
could be hardly better located than in a park where
idle revelers go on Sunday to spend the week's earn
â : merry-go-rounds, Punch and Judy shows
and dime museums. It is at such a place free silver
rs are most likely to get a hearing. As the
people witl not attend silver conferences, the confer
ust i- 1 " to the people, and as the congregations
in the churches would not sanction such oratory the
speakers are in a manner forced to the picnic re
sorts where it may be readily supposed they find
many persons eager for cheap money and plenty of it.
The discourses of the day were about as lurid as
hioned hell-fire M-rmons, and no doubt consti
'ttrnctions in harmony with the two-headed
calf, tin. bearded lady, the African gyascutas and other
freaks and sensations of the picnic. Mr. Tarvin of
Kentucky made hi- debut as a New Englandtr by
declaring the demonetization of siiver "concentrates
wealth, makes tramps and criminals of men and sui
ind prostitutes of women." Tillman, who rep
a section of New England
in th< <;ri'd his hearers he would use his
pitchfork before- the convention closes and use it with
effect Mr. Lentz of Ohio was even more thrilling.
ar,d to! "We look to New England
with amazement when we see the cringing servility
of i l -. masses to that plutocrat! oligarchy wl
nore arbitrary and more inconsistent than any mon
arch in Europe."
The speech of the occasion was that of Altgeld. It
showed traces of a genuine Xew England spirit, in
asmuch as it was confined almost wholly to a discus
sion of New England condition- nd paid but little
attention to the affairs of the rest of the country.
Any one who rends it will perceive that had Altgeld
been a resident of Boston itself instead of a dweller
in such a remote suburb as Chicago he would have
been a Puritan. He declared that with free silver
every mill in New England would be running day
and night, there would be abundant market* for all
produce, and wage-earners would have money to
i] â  nd as well as money to save.
Altogether it â¢ â  â  rrious picnic occasion, and
the first day of the first meeting of the \- â 
Bimetallic :-â  ;i Sunday picnic ;
neighborhood of Providence will be loi
1,. red by all who were present and alternated between
tb< speeches and the merry-go-rounds.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 6, 1599.
INTEMPERATE UTTERANCE.
'np'HE Oakland Tribune praises the patience of the
imperialists with their opponents, and d< dares
that those who oppose conquest have put to
ire te^t the endurance of those who favor it.
We have no sympathy with any who descend to
: personalities in the great controversy, nor with those
who use it merely as a means to get office. But when
discussion turns upon intemperance of utterance it 1,
i not to be forgotten that it began with the advocates
of imperialism. The President is himself responsible
for the anti-imperialist sentiment. He was its tr-t
leader and exponent. His declaration that forcible
' annexation would be criminal aggression, opposed to
our national code of morals, was the most extreme
expression that has been uttered. It was in plain
terms the denunciation of conquest as a crime. The
conscience of the country accepted it. and has
1 not readily changed with the President, who now
< ffers another example of extreme statement by de
nouncing as "rebels" an alien people who are re
sisting forcible annexation. The reason why people
who accepted the President's first expression have not
'â¢â red to his second is to be sought in the style
chosen by imperialists in the beginning of their advo
cacy of their novel policy. When General Merritt
admitted last January that that policy was in opposi
tion to the constitution, but declared that the country
had outgrown the constitution, which was no longer
worth discussing, he alarmed the people. That alarm
was not lessened when Whitelaw Reid, one of the
Commissioners who made the Paris treaty, said that
the time had come to teach the American people the
absurdity of the Declaration of Independence.
The Tribune i< wroth because an audience in a
church in Cincinnati, facing Murat Halstead, gave
utterance to sympathy for Aguinaldo; but is silent
about that other audience in a church in Chicago,
h hist April heard approvingly their pastor. Hen
son, denounce the Declaration of Independence as
'"the most damn:. Me iie ever invented by the devil to
deceive men."
The Cincinnati audience was guilty of the offense
of passionate utterance upon an issue that can be de
cided only by the temperate and sober mind. The
Chicago audience was guilty of a position that strikes
at the very vitals of republican liberty. All over the
country for weeks the sentiment favored by the
Tribune declared itself in contempt of the constitu
tion and in enmity to the Declaration of Indepen
dence. Tho-e declarations were abhorrent to every
sentiment of patriotism and to every aspiration of
liberty. They were in rebuke of the men who died
for the establishment of the republic and of the other
countless thousands who fell in red war that the
Union might be perpetuated. The men who were
most moved to action by these sinister and alarming
expressions of venom against the principles of our
Government were Republicans of the school of Lin
coln. In ail his utterances he went back to the
Declaration of Independence as the rock on which
the republic is founded. He gloried in its statement
of the fundamental truths of civil government, and
declared that when tyrants and traitors assailed the
principle of the equality of men the masses would go
back forever to that Declaration as to their title to
the guarantees of the constitution.
We have read no apology for Merritt, Reid and
Henson. The imperialist-, instead of repudiating
their venom against the' constitution and the Declara
tion, have defiantly adopted it into their creed.
Having done so, they turn upon the anti-imperial
ists and impeach their motives because of intemperate
: and passionate expressions by some who believe that
forcible annexation is criminal aggression, opposed
: to our national code of morals.
The anti-imperialist sentiment does not need to take
refuge in epithet. It represents the sober mind of
the country, which will finally decide the i^sue. It
resorts to no legend nor motto beyond the words of
President McKinley himself, which we have already
quoted. He stated the case of anti-imperialism better
than any other has stated it. In his statement the
whole case is carried. Eulogies of Aguinaldo are un
necessary. Let him stand where the President's
phrase put him as the victim of criminal aggression.
In that character his personal merits and demerits
are lost sight of. Above all things, the soldiers of
the country are deserving of all honor. They have
done their best and highest in obedience to their duty
and their oath. It is the President himself who has
described them as engaged under orders, in criminal
aggreâ >sed to our national morality. Xo
other has gone further in characterization. All the
greater sympathy goes out to the troops that they nrc
sent to a duty so described by the same President
who orders them to it.
The war of conquest should be speedily closed, for
only when it is over does the experiment begin for
which it was undertaken. The nature of that experi
ment is revealed in the commercial expectations of
the imperialists. These have had their latest expres
sion in the utterances of Senator Carter, an earnest
imperialist, who says: "The Republican party will
retain the Philippines as a matter of business profit.
This is a practical age. We are going to deal witii
this question on the basis of dollars and cents. If the
American people believe that the Philippines are
going to help us. they will never let the islands go.
If, on the other hand, they find that the Philippines
mean a constant drain and small returns, you will find
the people against permanent retention. Neither re
ligion nor sentiment will have much influence in de
termining the verdict. The great question is, 'Will it
pay?' "
We suppose the Tribune will admit that this is the
first time in our history that Americans have been
asked to go beyond seas, in a poison climate, to wage
a war for mere dollars and cents and to make a con
quest in order to see whether it will pay when made.,
and to give it up if it doesn't.
The anti-imperialists have no need to use epithets
nor devise arguments, for their opponents supply all
thai they need to use.

GETT ING AHEAD OF THE PROCESSION
GEORGE FRED WILLIAMS, the silver leader
of Massachusetts, and C. T. Callahan. chair
man of the Democratic State Committee, to
gether with certain followers and supporters, have de
vised a scheme which is giving the conservative Dem
ocrats of the State more pain than they can cure with
a bottle of Bourbon. In accordance with the scheme
the Democratic State Convention called to nominate
candidates for State offices in the campaign this fall
elects also delegates to the National Convention in
1900. By this plan a solid silver delegation, with
Williams at the head, is assured from Massachusetts,
no matter how great may be the opposition of the
rank and file when the issue arises next year.
Mayor Quiricy of Boston lias taken the trouble to
enter a formal and vigorous protest against the plar
and to him Mr. Callahan has replied, in effect, that if
the conservatives do not like the plan they can do the
other thing. Such a reply from such a source leads
the Boston Herald to declare the silver men to be a
set of incompetents who do not understand the rudi
ments of politics. The leaders of a minority party, it
argues, ought to try to conciliate voters in order that
the party may have a chance to win. A willful irrita
tion of public opinion and a contemptuous disregard
of the wishes of those who are inclined to support
the party are evidences of asinine leadership, and tlvc
Herald angrily adds that in Massachusetts the aver
age citizen would rather vote for a party led by
knaves than one led by fools.
Whether that judgment be sound is not for us to
say. It is certain, however, that in no State do the
voters look favorably upon such political tricks as the
one proposed. David B. Hill tried it once in New
York for the purpose of sending an anti- Cleveland
delegation to the Democratic convention of iÃq.?, and
he succeeded in getting such a delegation, but the
final result was not to his liking. A strenuous pro
test was made by other Democrats in the State, a
contesting delegation was sent to the National Con
vention, and, as the world knows. Cleveland was
nominated and elected. .Mr. Williams can hardly be
lieve himself an abler politician than Mr. Hill or
think his machine stronger than that of Tammany,
and if he and Mr. Callahan be not as incompetent as
the Herald declares them they might with advantage
study the experience of the New York men.
It is not easy to understand why the silver men
should undertake a snap judgment on the voters of
the party in Massachusetts unless it be they are veri
table incompetents in authority. The Massachusetts
vote in a Democratic convention will not have much
weight, for no one expects the State to support the
ticket. About all Williams can gain from the trick is
an assurance of his election as a delegate, and if he
be certain the rank and file of the party are with him
he is foolish in not leaving the party free to elect him
in the regular way. About the only conclusion to be
drawn from the performance is that the New England
silver leader.^ are afraid to trust even their own party
and are willing to resort to any tactics to obtain n
temporary advantage.
It is announced in all seriousness that the transport

EXCESSIVE AND VICIOUS LEGISLA
TION.
SENATOR MANDERSON, in giving a review
of the legislation of the past year, in the course
of his address at the recent meeting of the
American Bar Association, summed up the results of
the work of the State Legislatures in this statement:
'"I doubt if in any twelve months since the foundation
of our State governments has there been so much
legislation. Forty-one of the States and Territories
have held legislative sessions. In some of tlie States
the session laws for 1899 fill over 1000 pages, and the
average number of pages is much over 500. The
quality is not sufficient warrant for the quantity, an 1
if it be true that "the country is governed best which
is governed least,' then, indeed, most of the States are
in a sorry plight. A critical examination of these laws
will not only force. the conclusion that we are gov
erned too much, but the character of much of the
legislation, with its socialistic tendency, its destruction
of individuality, interference with personal liberty.
encroachment upon property rights, making of the
State not only a fostering father but a nursing
mother, will affright every true lover of liberty."
There is of course a rhetoric.;! exaggeration in trre
statement that the legislation of the year will affright
every true lover of liberty. It is well understood by
intelligent men that the vicious or harmful legisla
tion upon the statute books of the various States is
the result of carelessness or of ignorance rather than
of any deliberate attempt to interfere with liberty or
to injure property. As soon as a statute is found to
be bad, public opinion turns against it, and it is either
repealed at the next session or left unenforced.
There is nothing to affright patriots in our laws,
but there is a great deal that interferes with business,
prevents progress, checks development, disturbs in
dustry and engenders discontent. There is. moreover,
a good deal of it that tends to incline the thoughtless
into the belief that the ills of civilization, the evils
resulting from individual deficiencies, can be reme
died by statute. Thus one bad law, even though it be
promptly repealed, leads to the enactment of another
just about as bad, and we pass from one folly to
another with each successive Legislature.
It will not be easy to eliminate these offenses of
legislation from our governmental system. Where
popular government prevails the statute books must
necessarily reflect the opinions of the dominant ele
ment in politics. The majority of men elected to our
State Legislatures are not fitted for the task of deal
ing with the complex problems of modern statecraft,
and yet they have no hesitation in undertaking to do
so. Thus we have every year a sort of jungle of
statutes through which the courts have to clear a way
for business.
The only remedy for the evil is that of ridding the
popular mind of its errors regarding the scope and
the possibilities of legislation. When the voters are
no longer subject to the promises of agitators, dema
gogues, visionary reformers and others of that class,
when they elect as legislators none but men of a high
order of sagacity and a broad knowledge of the
limitations as well as the effectiveness of legislation,
we shall have fewer laws and better ones. In the
meantime we must get along as best we can. Ameri
can common sense makes short work of silly laws, and
in all the confusion of the statutes, while there is much
to annoy, there is nothing to frighten a true lover of
liberty.
A young lady in a Massachusetts town has been
struck dumb by eating an apple. Some friend of his
fellow men might benefit humanity by importing
some of those apples and feeding them to a set of
local street orators.
President Schurman of the Philippine Commission
hopes there will be an early end to the Filipino war.
It is remarkable how some people can divine the
thoughts and express the wishes of the American
people.
It begins to look as if death will reap a rich harvest
before Great Britain and the Transvaal realize that
they were both wrong and that votes are not always
more valuable than lives.
FORCING AN EXTRA
SESSION ON THE PEOPLE
The Mexican Candidate and the Governor Have the Law and
Public Opinion Against Them, butâ,
EDITOR of The Callâ Kir: To those
who read the signs of th.- times,
there can be no question thai the
M< xlcan candidate for United
States Senator, with his usual
dogged pi rsistency, will, if pos
sible, through the unstinted use of the
Governor's patronage, endeavor to pur
chase, cajole >>r threaten enough men
Into a promise sufficient to elect him if
ority of th? whole of the last
Legislature will ay roe to go Into caucus.
The fact that the iast Bessicn of the
Legislature wan frittered and wasted by
his ridiculous aspirations does not s em
to disclose to thÂ« mind <>f tha would-be
statesman any reason why there should
not be another session which he may
use, regardless of cost to the people, as
a stepping-stone to lift himself into the
saddle as a United States Senator. The
obstacle is ilia; then- will be no regular
session of the Legislature until the first
week in January, 190 L It therefore be
comes necessary to attempt to prosti
tute the extraordinary powers vested in
the chief executive of the State ami to
persuade or cajole him into calling an
extra session of th'- Legislature.
This can only be done by a flagrant
violation of the law and by trampling
under foot every principle crystallized
in the constitution of the State of Cali
fornia. The entire trend of constitu
tional limitation of past years has been
in this State, as well as in others, to re
strict the powers of the Legislature and
to limit the time when that body, in
stalled in the State capital, might sup
port itself from the public treasury.
Recognizing that nothing is so fraught
with danger, the constitution provides
by the second section of its fourth arti
cle that no pay shall be drawn by a
member after sixty days from the date
of the commencement of the session. It
also provides that no bill shall be in
troduced after a period of fifty days
from tn>' 'i;tt.' of the commencement of
the session, thereby stopping the regu
lar business and tne pay or the mem
bers tor tiiÂ» purpose of provoking an
early adjournnn nt.
owing to the fact that the sessions
;n,. biennial, and that during the long
period between them th. re- might arise
some exigency which v.^uld require im
mediate attention at the hands or the
of the State, the constitution, in
it- definition <>f th< powers of the Gov
ernor, gives to th;.t official by section 'J
of the rtfth article the powet to call by
proclamation an extra session Ihe
language may well be repeated here
verbatim:
"H<- may on <xtraordinary oc
casions, convene the Legisla'ure
by proclamation, staling the pur-
P : jsl-s for which he has conv< n< <t
it and when so convened it shall
hive no power to Legislate on any
subjects other than those speci
fied' in the proclamation, but may
provide for ih.- expanses of the
session and other matters inci
;l thereto."
This language would seem plain to the
ordinary mind, but it has been held that
arts of the Legislature which were not
|i I islative might be performed in a
special sesaion, Buch, for instance, as
confirming an appointment made by the
Governor, and, by the Burns people, it
is claimed the election oi a Lnlted
States Senator is also not legislative
and nÂ»ed not be embraced in the
proclamation and could not be the ob
ject of a special session.
So, then, the extraordinary occasion
must be sought H must be created.
And because a Superior Judge in an in
terior county has given a construction
to a decision of the Supreme Court of
the United States, this is to be made an
extraordinary occasion for the exercise
of the power by the Governor under the
section quoted! It must be evident,
however even to the infantile mind, to
say nothing aboul ihHt of the dis
tinguished Jurlsi who now occupies the
chair ol the chief executive, a man who
is a lawyer by profession and claims to
rank as' such at the head of his local
bar that a matter which was in exist
ence before the hist I. eerislature convened
and which as such existed through the
entire session, cannot be an extraordi
nary occasion under section 9 of article
5 of the constitution. It would be sup
posed when the question of extra ses
sion is discussed, that the Norwood
case of the United States Supreme

CHAPLAINS BANQUETED.
The clericus of the Episcopal church
entertained as guests of honor at a dinner
given Monday evening in the Occidental
Hotel Chaplain Flemming of the Colorado
Reg-iment and Chaplain McAllister of the
United States cruiser Philadelphia. Tha
dinner was an excellent one and the even
ins was pleasantly passed in listening to
reminiscences of the groat happenings
that have tilled the country with their
glory during the last eighteen months.
Bishop Nichols and Bishop Moreland
both were present, as was almost every
prominent Episcopal clergyman in the
city. The Bishops made a few remarks
and then gave way to the peaceful men of
war. who entertained the guests with
stories of adventure by flood and field.
A number of complimentary things were
said by the different gentlemen present ot
the appointment of Rev. D. C. Garretl
to the pastorate of St. Luke's Church.
That gentleman replied to these kindly
words of welcome and in a few well
chosen sentences assured those present of
the appreciation he felt for the compli
ments they had showered him with.
Court is a recent discovery, but that is
not true.
During the entire time that th.- Legis
lature of this State consumed in banot-
Ing foi a i nited States â¢ nator, last
January and February and a pan of
March," this decision was open iuw to
any one who chose to reau ti, because
it was decided upon the l^tn day of
December, 1898, and appeared in pamph
let form early in January. Fhe bar of
the State will await u:e proclamation
(or an extra session in a condition of
amused expectancy, which, when the
noted case is read will change :nt.> a
roar of laugnter; Jur the Norwi
do. s n<>T decide anything which the
Burns people claim for it, and it is so
foreign to the plea under which the
extra session is to be called iha: one
need not be a lawyer to kn iw how
flimsy the pretext and to what desperate
straits the politicians v.ii. attempt to
adopt it must bi driven. Norwood
against Baker Is not a street assessmi ni
case, nor Is i; a street improvement < ise
within the meaning of the Vrooman act.
The law relating to local assessment
for the purpose of improving a street,
that is, sewering, paving, sidewalklng,
grading and regraamg, has long been
settled, both In this btate, in tne At
lantic States and by the supreme Court
of the I'nited States, and do one may
question it, not even a political lawyer.
The street law has been framed undei
a section of the constitution which has
been in existence ever since California
was a State, copied from ;he constitu
tions of the older States, repeatedly and
consistently construed judicially, and
to-day the Vrooman act is as good and
street improvements are as constitu
tional as they have ever been in the State
of California, and there is nothing to
question the doctrine in the case of Nor
wood against Baker. Norwood against
Baker is not a stieet improvement case;
it was an action for eminent domain
for the condemnation of land, by which
the estate of the defendant was sought
to be taken from him and appropriated
to the purposes of a public street, and
it was attempted to charge him not
only with the benefits which it was said
his remaining land would receive by tak
ing away from him one piece of his
land, but it was also sought to tax htm
with the very costs of the condemnation
suit.
When you divest a citizen of his prop
erty by condemnation or under the doc
trine of public use, the constitutional
questions at once become very grave
and serious, because from the early
days of the Knglish-speaking race, from
the time that the common law received
its recognition in England, the Anglo-
Saxon has at all times been Jealous of
the rights of personal liberty and his
right of property. It is easy to see that
the taking away of a piece of land from
a man and causing him to pay a sum
of money for having: his land taken
away from him, should naturally jostle
and jar the Ideas of the average Anglo-
Saxon about property rights. And so
when the Governor of the State, should
he decide to call an extra session, comes
to look at the question, he will find,
flrst. that the conditions called "extra
ordinary" existed before the last ses
sion convened, and that an entire ses
sion of the Legislature passed without
taking any notice of what is now called
an "extraordinary occasion." He will
also find, if he takes the trouble to read
the case of Norwood against Baker,
that there is nothing in it "which in any
wise changes or checks the existing
street law of the State. If he will stop
to think and read the handwriting on
the wall, he will conclude that the tem
per of the people will not permit the
using of a flimsy pretext like this, un
founded in law and fact, to place the
Legislature of the State at the service
of an unscrupulous politician.
In conclusion I would respectfully re
fer the Governor to the last two para
graphs of the decision rendered by the
Supreme Court In the Norwood case,
which are as follows:
The judgment of the Circuit
Court must be affirmed, upon the
ground that the assessment
apainst the plaintiffs abutting
property was under a rule which
excluded any inquiry as to special
benefits, and the necessary op
eration of which was, to the
extent of the excess of the cost
of opening- the street in question
over any special benefits accruing
to the abutting property there
from, to take private property
for public use without compensa
tion.
It is so ordered.

CHANCE FOR DISBARRED
ATTORNEY PHILBROOK
OFFENSIVE PETITION STRICKEN
FROM THE RECORDS.
Horace \V. Philhrook, the disbarre/1 at
torney, is waiting far the verdict of the
Supreme Court to find "where he is at."
As published recently, he has made an
effort to have the disbarment judgment
set aside, ?o that he may follow his pro
fession again. This is now in the court
under advisement. It will be remembered
that in ISHS Philbrook was prohibited by
the Justices of the higher court from
practicing hereafter because of his con
duct in the Levinson case. Last January
he made a motion to have the case re
heard, but his petition was in such lan
guage that the Justices refused to con-
Bider the matter, whereupon he filed his
petition formally in court. Then he set
about to prepare a brief in Bupport of the
position lie had assumed.
The brief was a rabid attack upon the
court and many attorneys of this city
While he presented a copy to all inter
ested parties he has not filed the docu
ment in the court as yet. This was com
piled to be made use of in the event of
the court giving him a chance to discuss
his case. Yesterday the motion calendar
was heard, but Philbrook's case was not
down on the records of the day so the
court had nothing to consider. However
Philbrook made an ex parte motion to'
which attention was given. In his pre
amble he recited the nature of the judg
ment of disbarment and applied to have
the same declared null and void and set
aside. In substance it was very similar
to the one made in January, but in milder
language.
Chief Justice Beatty stated that the
motion as it was presented was not in
such form that it could be immedlatelv
considered by the court, which however
would take the matter under advisement'
He then directed that the clerk strike
from the records of the court the Deti
tion made by Philbrook in January This
is the one to which the court found such
objection regarding the language

A CHRISTIAN GREETING
TO THE SOLDIER BOYS
The Epworth League Alliance or tma
city tendered a reception last evening at
the Grace M B. <"hureh to the Methodist
volunteer soldiers now stationed at the
Presidio. The event was one of the most
successful and elaborate ever undertaken
by the local leagues and the attendance
was large. Appropriate decorations were
everywhere In evidence. From the coil
ing over the pulpit hu^e streamers of the
national colors were gracefully festooned
ami on all sides were decorations of the
Stars am! Stripes;
two hundred of the soldiers boys
were entertained. As they marched down
the aisles to the front of the church the
audience rose and sang "America," wav
ing miniature flags. C. K. Perkins of the
Simpson M. E. Church was master of
les. He stated that thr> purpose
of the gathering was to extend a Chris
tian welcome to the soldier boys. The
address of welcome was delivered by
was common. He d'd not see any of
them approach the wagons and was
unaware of anything unusual occur
ring until informed of the accident
by a man who hailed him when about
a block off. He stopped his horse and
went back to where the hoy was lying
and had assisted In carrying him into
a house and then hastened off for Dr.
Torello, who lives near the Five-mile
house, and sent him out to attend to
Pratt.
He thought the injuries were slight,
as both wagons were empty at the
time, and that no serious damage was
done. He had intended to deliver him
self up to the police when approached
by Detective Fitzgerald.

at Ocean View, but rooms near the
place of his employer, Adam Ifanna.
who visited him while in prison and
gave him to understand that he would
befriend him through his trial.
Rev. John Hannon of Alameda, a veteran
of the Confederate Army. His remarks
were replete with humor and wit and he
kept the audience in an uproar of laugh
ter from the time he was Introduced until
he bowed himself off the platform. He
said that. Nature joined with the people
in shouting a welcome to the returning
volunteers. "Even up the Sacramento
Valley," said ho, "the malaria stretches
forth its hands in welcome and says
'Shake.' The girls are reaching' out their
arms in welcome also, but I tell you
boys if you ever get those arms around
yen. your fat.- will be sealed."
Charl-s Jacobs, fourth vice president of
the Epworth Alliance, extended a wel
come in behalf of the league and the
Christian Endeavorers. He deplored the
fact that in all tho great celebration ar
ranged by the citizens of the city there
was no mention of a religious greeting to
th<- soldiers.
Other numbers on the programme were-

FIRST VISIT TO
THIS COAST OF
THE MARBLEHEAD
Over Four Months
Getting Here.
The United States cruiser Marblehead
arrived from New York via the Straits of
Magellan yesterday. She has been over
four months getting- here from the Barba
dos, but was only fifty-four days at sea.
All the rest of the time was spent in port
coaling or overhauling.
The Marblehead, in company with other
vessels of Sampson's fleet, rendezvoused J
at Saint Lucia in April last and on the
29th >>f that month the Newark and Mar- I
blehead were ordered to San Francisco.
The Marblehead had to stop thirteen
times on the way for coal, while the New
ark had to recoal only four times. Owing !
to her delay in the Straits of Magellan j
the Newark was the last to reach Callao. I
She was just making port as the Marble- I
head was leaving. She heat the Marble- i
head Into port, however, owing to her j
greater coal rapacity.
The voyage of the Marblehead was an
uneventfui one. There was no sickness j
and no accidents occurred, but twenty- i
two ut the men made things lively at i
Montevideo by deserting. They thought
they were cut out for cowboys so they
ran away and all of them succeeded in
reaching the interior. At Punta Arenas '
another man deserted, so the Marblehead '
lost twenty-three of her men, during the
voyage.
The sailors did not like the trip around
the Horn. T.hey had throe winters 'nside
of four months and that was running the i
extremes of heat and cold too close to j
suit them. In the Straits ot' Magellan '
they rearly froze to death while in the
-â  they were melting. There are a
number (>f time-expired men aboard the j
cruiser and they will be glad to receive |
their discharge. When she came into
port the Marhlehead anchored in the fair
way and in consequence she had to be i
moved. Rear Admiral Kautz's flag on the '
lowa â was then saluted with thirteen guns i
and the battleship replied. The officers of
the cruiser are Commander H. G. O. ,
Colby Lieutenant Commander J. A. <
Nkkells, Lieutenants fl. 3. Willets, C. F. j
Williams and W. G. Hretherton, Passed
Assistant Surgeon S. G. Evans. ' Passed '
Assistant Paymaster H. A. Dent, Naval
Cadets W. P. Cromar, and R. B. White
and Pay Clerk W. P. Atwell. She carries
a crew of 218 men.
The Marblehead is a sister ship to the
Detroit and Montgomery and was built
at Boston in 1892. She has a speed of
seventeen knots and is a good, handy ves
sel. During the war with Spain she was
principally employed in bombarding small
places on the coast of Cuba.
The sailors on the British ship British
Isles had sonic- hard-luck stories to ;â¢!.
yesterday. The vessel made a smart run
of 118 days from Cardiff, but the nun say
they w< re treated like dogs. They assert
that they did not get proper food and the j
supply of water was limited, while in |

Captain Dunbar reports that off the
Horn the British Isles was in heavy

beach bow on. The tugs Reliance and '

How Mrs. Pinkham
' HELPED MRS, (lOODEN.
[LITTER TO MRS. FINKHAM NO. 12,733]
"I am very grateful to you for your
kindness and the interest you have
taken in me, and truly believe your
medicines and advice are worth more
to a woman than all the doctors in the
world. For years I had female troubles
and did nothing for them. Of course
I became no better and finally broke
down entirely. My troubles began
with inflammation and hemorrhages
from the kidneys, then inflammation,
congestion and falling of the womb
and inflammation of ovaries.
" I underwent local treatment every
day for some time ; then after nearly
two months the doctor gave me. permis-
sion to go back to work. I went back,
but in less than a week was com-
pelled to give up and go to bed. On
breaking down the second time, I de-
cided to let doctors and their medicine
alone and try your remedies. Before
the first bottle was gone I felt the ef-
fects of it. Three bottles of Lydia E.
Pinkham"s Vegetable Compound and a
package of her Sanative Wash did me
more good than all the doctors' treat-
ments and medicine.
â¢'The first remark that greets me
now is 'How much better you look!' and
you may be sure I never hesitate to tell
the cause of my health." â Mbs. E. J.

Dried Fruit in New York.
The New York Commercial Bays: "There is
no charge in the dried fruit situation. Sales
are chiefly of small lots for Immediate con-
Btunpflon or to complete broken assortments.
There Is no change in futures. "While rumors
ere plentiful enough regarding sales. it 18 im
possible to find that any of the reported trans
actions have been closed. Buyers and sellers
alike are firm in their views, and until one or
the other makes concessions trade will be light.
"Prunes remain practically unchanged. There
are unconfirmed rumors of large sales, but co
far as known none has been consummated.
Quotations ranee from sic for 40-60*8 down to
Ec for small sizes. Outside goods have been
bought lees than Be, but the quantity has prob
ably been insufficient to really make a mar
ket". The crop promises well, and It is said
that young trees Doming into bearing this year
will yield enough to make good the shortage in
"Washington and Oregon; No important export
business has been done yet, and inquiry from
the other sine is reported light.
"There are report? that prunes have been or
fered below quotations, but confirmation is im
possible There is a suspicion that some parties
are trying to force the price down by persist
ently circulating these reports. Conditions are
unchanged, and if any quantity of new goods
has been offered under the opening quotations
the particulars art- beins kept very secret.
'Teaches appear to be stagnant. The asking
nrlce is Cv64c for Immediate shipment, but it
Is said that a few sales have been made below
that figure. Holders are reluctant to â¢ force
business by reducing quotations, and buyers do
not care to invest much money at present
prices, with the possibility of a drop staring
them in the face.
"Apricots are nearly all gone from first
hands, and holders are stiff in their views on
prices The shortage in cans hurt apricots less
than peaches, because canning was about done
before the shortage developed.
"Opening prices on raisins are expected dally
and until they come little or no business will
be done. Some sales are being made subject to
association figures, but In the main trade in
all positions 16 very quiet."

EASTERN MARKETS.
Nnv York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Sept. s.â The buoyancy of a
handful of individual stocks gave an appear
ance of considerable strength and activity to
the stock market, but outside of these few
Stocks the market was narrow and apathetlo to
the last degree. Shortly after the opening
Northwestern was marked up sharply and the
usual response was made in other numbers of
the Vanderbilt group. Union Pacific also fol
lowing the lead. As was the case last week
the heavy offerings of Union Pacific brough
out on the advance checked the enthusiasm of
the buying, and operations in that particular
group were for the most part discontinued.
Northwestern' extreme rise was 4%, the pre
preferred 8 points above the previous sale;
Omaha 8: Xew York Central and Union Pa
cific over a point. New York, Chicago and St.
Louis stocks advanced from I*4 to 4 points on
a rumor that Judicial aid was to be sought to
enforce asserted rights to dividends. The coal
ers were In good demand, Lackawanna leading
with a rUe of 3%. Gains in this group were
not maintained entirely. Other railroad stocks
which roue a point or over were St. Paul pre
ferred, Colorado Midland preferred. Wheeling
and Lake Rrie second preferred. Hocking Val
ley and Chicago Great Western preferred A and
B. Transactions elsewhere in the railroad list
â were quite Insignificant. There was a Blight
response In the early dealings to the depres
sion In tho London market. The bulk of the
trading was in the more volatile specialties.
Tennessee Coal was the most cons;jiauous fig
ure In to-day"B markets. After dropping a
fraction, it was aggressively Ufti-d by suoces
slvb stages 9 full points, and closed at 108. the
ton price.. Colorado Fuel apparently sympa

EH There was good demand for Republic Steel
at "an advance of 2*4, and Federal Steel rose a
â point Otherwise the Iron and steel stoclt3
showed but a slight response. The New York
municipal stocks, Including both gas and trac- j
tion stocks, were quite buoyant and show gains \
of from 2 to 6 points, the latter Metropolitan
Street Railway. American Tobacco rose an j
extreme 3 points and Sugar 1%. Chicaro Ter- |

Chicago Witeat Market.
I CHICAGO, Sept. 6.â The first Impulse of
' traders in wheat was to buy slightly higher,
i quotations from Liverpool overshadowing for
â  the time the heavy receipts elsewhere. The
i result was an opening: advance of about %<Â§)
1 140 In December and *ie In September, De
i cember starting at 71%<&71% and September at
! 69 T 4c. A short period of realizing followed,
during which December declined to 71*60, but
' the steadiness displayed by corn and some
i rather bullish reports on the condition of the
' spring wheat crop sent the price back to the
opening figures, where they held for a short
time. Everything else In the way of news fa
vored the selling side, and before 11 o'clock
the market began to weaken, and from that
! time to the close deferred futures exhibited
more or leas weakness. September, however,
; was quite steady. The elevator people were
i buyers of September on account of the small
carrying charge, and the premium between
i September and December was reduced to l*4o.
Marked weakness developed in the northwest,
and a good many selling orders cams from
' that section, which influenced the real trad
! ing.
Both Duluth and Minneapolis declined fart
' er and further than Chicago, and predicted
'â â  a continuance of heavy receipts. This, with
I the poor cash demand, had a marked influence
1 on trading in December and May, and made
: those options thÂ« object of considerable
: liquidation and short selling. Speculation at
: times was nearly at a standstill, which made
; the cash weakness more apparent. Toward the
1 close there was a tendency to cover by shorts
i who bad sold earlier In the day, and this
: caused slight rallies. December declined to
70% c and advanced -to 71 Â©71 Vie, where it
closed. September closed at Â«9Slo.
Corn showed considerable firmness In view
1 of the enormous crop estimates, and after a
i period of weakness, early, ruled higher to the
1 close. The weather in the corn belt was dry
j and hot. and there was apparently some ap
; prehension of damage, complaints of which
were numerous. - September was especially
strong. December closed at Vl<ff%c higher.
Oats were steady, but very dull, prices keep
ing within a narrow range. The market in
general followed corn, and closed at a slight
1 advance. There was some buying by Septem
ber shorts. Thf> shipping demand was fair.
December closed a shade higher. September
closed He higher.
Provisions were steady, notwithstanding
lower cables and reports of yellow fever at
Key West. Belling was l*Â«ht and scattered,
and the demand fair. The utrength of corn
helped the market, everything closing firm
at an advance. At the etose October pork was
7*4 c higher, lard 7*4 c higher. t> ribs TVi^lOc
higher.

Harrison's circular says:
"Since the Moana left the following coal
cargoes have been delivered here, viz.: Jacques,
2490 tons; General Fairchild, 2300 ton?; Flor
ence, 2214 tons; dwell, 2090 tons; Bretagne,
2710 tons; Wachusett, 2468 tons; Palmyra, 1895
tons; Lamoriciere. â  2504 tons; total, 18,671 tons.
There are at present only twenty-four vessels
under engagement to carry coals here from
Australia, with a carrying capacity of less than
CO, OOO tons, fully 30,000 less than the same
period in 1898. But lew names are being added
to our loading list in the colonies, as the num
ber is diminishing monthly, i. c., vessels that
are arriving here are not being replaced with
others at the Newcastle side. Every cargo
that arrives has passed out of first hands long
since, and in some cases has changed hands
several times, each time at a profit Evidently
coal tonnage must be scarce in the colonial
ports, as Importers here are willing to pay full
rates without effecting charters. Honolulu is
a formidable competitor for coal carriers, as
20e per ton is offered for early loading at New
castle.
"There will assuredly be a shortage of coal
fuel locally this winter; there Is no question
as to the ability of our northern collieries to
produce any required amount, but we are In
urgent need of carriers, both steam and eail,
to bring same to market. In the Interim the
market prices are strong and sellers are loth
to make contracts, except for Government sup

FOR NOVELTY
TURN TOWARD
THE ORPHEUM
WIAT a hungry surface of human
ity, with never a vacant chair,
one looks down upon at the Or
pheum. Hungry for amusement,
of course, and sure of satisfaction. No
ordinary "teams" worthy but a modest
fodder pull the fun chariot this week
most of them would pass the test of
thoroughbred. One can scarce go a
thought too far in praising the little
dancers, Arnold Grazer and La Petite
Hazel. Wonders of mites they are with
strength of toe and voice beyond their
years, amusing with rapid changes for all
the world like their elders. The male in
eptitude for handling a skirt finds no ex
pression in little Arnold's handsâ perhaps
because he has come to it young. Little
Hazel's specialty seems to be the cake
walk motions. She must be a most Ob
serving little sunbeam, for she has appro
priated about lh< best that cake walkers
have to offer. Like Moliere, perhaps, she
has taken her own where she found it
and this art of recognizing one's own Is
but little understood even by the brain
of the old and wise. I wish the children
a happy and profitable career in the
vaudeville world. Montell looks so little
like a juggler that his work surprises
one. Playing with fire is a pastime for
him and a beautiful satisfaction to his
audienceâ the brands look like flying
meteors. A woman close at my elbow
complained bitterly because he dropped
one. It might be well to remember that
Paderewski plays a wrong chord occa
sionally and that "Correse once sang a
false note." Who is the other man ii"t
down on the bill and hence, I suppose,
not charged for? He of the Cyrano
make-up. I mean. He creates the laughs
and I. for one. should like a printed In
troduction. The sarcasm and clever
home thrusts in the new sketch "Behind
the Scenes" are so satisfying and the
conception such a clever one that I could
wish the structural needs of the play
were a little better looked to. Felix Mor
ris always infuses his own artistic per
sonality into any part and a Frenchman
is his golden opportunity. I wonder If
Miss Wood Intended her costume as Miss
Bharpless, the authoress. If not. she has
builded better than she knew, for it Is the
real "Sunday best" of the literary lady.
Miss Mary Townley does the part of
Rose Dufard with a quiet Intelligence
thai, makes one suspect possibilities, and
the personality of Miss Ethel Harrison,
the leading lady, is most attractive.
Charley Case needs material. His songs
are good, though most of us will have to
adjust ourselves to his method before
they arc appreciated: He says some very
good things in his monologue and some
that I am sure are not recognized, his
delivery is so quiet. Still I think It Is
better material and not a change of atti
tude that tie needs. The attitude Is
fetching because original. The Hungar
ian Hoys' Military Hand, augmented in
numbers and t;esh and trim in costume,
h.js come back to us better than it went.
The boys have a larger repertoire and a
smoother method. Their leader is the
most earnest and the most modest
1 have \et seen. If he looked
once in a while, at a useful moment, he
would reailzp that some of the applause
Is meant for him. With Apollo, the
Moulieri Sisters and the biograph, who
shall find the Orpheum a field for savage
criticism?

GOOD PERFORMANCE
OF GOUNOD'S OPERA
Barron Berthald and Anna Licuter
Essay Romeo and
Juliet.
1 The success of "Romeo and Juliet" de
penda of course mainly on the artistic
i qualifications of those vocalists who essay
the leading- rules. Gounod attempted a
very different task when endeavoring to
put Shakespeare's highly dramatic story
into music. That he (lid not do justice to
tlx- theme is generally conceded and yet
If two artists Join forces in a truly ro
mantic version of the parts they will be
well able to interest their audiencea.
There are, no doubt, greater artists and
vocalists than those at the Tivoli on th<
stage to-day who are heard in this opera,
hut hardly any of them will go through
their work with more sincerity than Bar
ron Berthald and Anna Lichter, who were
chosen by the Tivoli management to play
these roles. I
Until vocalists have studied the vocal
score with exceeding care and render it
conscientiously. Mr. Berthaid fosters be-
Bides an agreeable tenor a capacity for
acting that is very useful to him in the
portrayal of romantic characters and his
intensify of action Is so strong that Miss
Lichter, who is usually not very fortunate
in complying with the elecutionary part
of her Work, was carried along and did
really some remarkably good acting at
times. That the opera is not as popular
as "Faust' must be ascribed to a mo
notonous treatment of the theme which
Beems to repeat like phrases in almost
every n^t. In other words, the composer
omitted to introduce a variety of themes
according to the variety of dramatic in
cidents.
Next to the commendable work of Mr.
Berthald and Miss Lichter the orchestra
is deserving of some attention. Mr.
Hirschfeld, whose seriousness us a musi

cess of this present grand opera season,
does not shun any effort to give the San
Francisco public the very best rendition
of great musical works that can possibly

disputed that those who attend the grand

ACCUSED OF AN ATTEMPT
TO BLOW UP A HOUSE
KESWICK, Sept. s.â Mrs. J. 11. Plumb,
who came so near to being blown up with
her children Sunday morning by an explo

caused the arrest of William H. Snyder
of this place, whom she believes is guilty
of having caused the explosion. Snyder
was arrested here late last evening and
taken to the county jail, where he lingers
in default of 12000 ball.
Snyder is a barkeeper, long a resident
of Keswick. and has borne a good repu

her disgust, and that he has repeatedly

ALAMEDA COUNTY NEWS.
A CHILD CREMATED
BY BURNING GRASS
BERKELEY, Sept. s.â Sparks from a passing engine of the California
and Nevada narrow-gauge road were responsible this morning for the
tragic death of a little five-year-old child in Lorin. Shortly before
noontime Alma Christlanson was playing in some dry grass with two
companions Stanley Rose and his younger sister. As the train passed them
live coals set fire to the grass, which in turn caught the child's clothing,
and before help could arrive the little one was literally burned to a crisp.
The scene of the accident was in the vicinity of Irwin and Ix>well
streets Vacant lots covered with dry grass line the railroad track for some
distance and small grass fires are almost of daily occurrence In the neigh
borhood. To-day as the train went by a blaze started as usual, but this time
before its force was spent it took with it a human life.
Screams from the burning child first called the attention of the neigh
bors The family of C. C. Bishop, on Irwin and I,owell streets, were the
first to be attracted by her cries. From a window In the upper story of his
house Mr Bishop looked out to see the little one enveloped in flames. Be
fore he could reach the spot all the girl's clothing had been burned off the
body and the little form was almost lifeless as he ran with it to the par
ents' home. Although physicians were summoned immediately, nothing could
be done After an hour of terrible agony the sufferer passed away.
John Christianson. the father, is employed in r lead factory in San Fran
cisco. The family, which includes six young children, is very poor, and the
neighbors have started a subscription for the funeral.
TURNED THE TABLES
ON HIS HOUSEKEEPER
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, Sept. 5.
Up to about last May Adelaide Bade,
single and forty, reigned as cook and
housekeeper in the domicile of Charles L.
Stevens, a widower and rancher of Pleas
anton. Now they never speak as they
pass by nor do they put themselves out

farm life after two years' experience,
Adelaide Bade hied her to livelier scenes
in San Francisco and soon tiled suit
against her former lord and employer for
the recovery of $4i<3 si balance claimed
due for services rendered. And now the

dainties and attentions he provided Cor
her during their happier days, and for
having her washing done.
The Bade suit was re^ntly transferred
from San Francisco to the Superior Court
of this county and to-day Stevens

Continuing the crosa-complalnt recites:
"That during the two years last past

which plaintiff was compelled to give his
entire attention to defendant inasmuch as
she was sick and unable to leave her
room: during which time he was at con
siderable expense, in producing and pro
viding her wth edibles and delicacies
suitable to her condition, and that during
these times he had her washing done.
"That said room, board and services
rendered were reasonably worth $I."> per

Dunham's bones lie bleaching In the
Pacheco Hills a kindly fate has effectual

his party have been unable so far to find
the slightest trace of them. From sun
rise to dark the officers rode the hills to
day, looked into ravir.es and underbrush,

This morning Keener endeavored to get
his bearings by entering from the Los

the country, but not the place he wanted.
They worked over the whole country,
through which Keener thought he had
passed The posse stretched out in a
long line At dusk they returned and
the -ack 'the Sheriff carried on the back
of his saddle to receive the bones of
Dunham was empty. The hunt will be
resumed to-morrow.

CRIPPLED BY THE
CARS AT FRUITVALE
OAKLAND, Sept. s.â "l'd much rather
be dead than this way. Here 1 lie with
one leg off and my other foot crushed. It
will have to be taken off a-s well, and then
what'll I be good for?" The speaker lying
on the operating table at the Receiving
Hospital was Martin Wyatt, aged 22
years, employed at the Penfleld Steel
Works ;ind residing with his sister, Mrs.
H H Griffin, at 114% Turk street. San
Francisco. Hi s remarkable constitution
and vitality were the wonderment of Drs.
"tratton Rowe, 'Wilcox and Pratt, who
were preparing for the painful operation.
The young man, now crippled for life
and his hopes of recovery by no means
bright had crossed the bay this afternoon
Â, se c some friends off to Stockton. It
had been his intention to leave them at
Frultvale but he had no idea that the 5
o'clock Stockton train speeds past Fruit
vale without stopping, and when he saw
his mistake he attempted to jump from
the train. He held to the iron railing a
second too long and was dragged and
thrown beneath the cruel wheels.
RELIC OF THE BIG
RAILROAD STRIKE
I OAKLAND, Sept. s.â Judge Ellsworth
' to-day handed down a decision giving
; Samuel W. Elliott judgment for $700 and
'â . costs against the Southern Pacific Com
j pany.
i The Bult has been in litigation for near
ly five years and grew out of the fact that
Elliott was expelled from a train when he
i had in his possession a limited trip ticket.
He resided at Fleasanton in July.
1894 when the American Railway Union
strike occurred. He bought a round-trip
ticket from his home to San Francisco,
the terma allowing him to return to
Plfasanton within three days. Owing to
the strike he could not return within that
time, and when the trains began running
again he attempted to ride on the
! strength of his ticket and was ejected.
The suit was first tried before a jury,
i but a disagreement resulted, and latterly
the matter was tried before Judge Ells
< worth.

scones in backrooms of restaurants and
lively transactions at dances were de
scribed by the witnesses. Tho paternity
of a child is also an element in the suit,
which will probably occupy several days.

a crack an inch wide was made in the
structure, extending from the top of the
rear entrance to the gable.
For several weeks timid residents of
Mill Valley have told of rumblings seem
ingly proceeding from Mount Tamalpais,

SAYS HUSBAND
TAUGHT HER TO
DRINK LIQUOR
Mrs. Watson Answers
Divorce Suit.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. 5.
Mrs. Lulu Watson, who is being sued
for a divorce by i- r husband, James "Wat
son, <mi the m-'nnui of desertion and ha
i'ii:ial Intemperance, to-day filed an an
swer ami cross-complaint of a rather sen
sational nature, virtually declaring that
thÂ«- shoo is on the other foot ami openly
i pharging her husband with inducing ncr
to acquire the liquor habit.
Her answer Beta forth that they were
married in April, 1893, at which ume she
was the proprietress of a fashionable
boarding-house in New Haven, Conn.,
and was worth $I'Vhw In money and
jewelry.
Her cross-complaint goes on to recite
that ho r husband "induced her to drink
in order that he might extort all hei
money ami jewelry from her"; that after
he had accomplished this he deserted her
in the streets of Chicago eighteen months
agn.
While in Chicago, says the cross-com
plaint, Watson struck her in the face with
his list, knocking her down, blackening
I her eyes and bruising her face; then he
1 locked the room and left her there alone
: all night. Later relatives sent Mrs. Wat
i son to a "White Plains, N. V., gold cure
establishment, and While she was under
treatment there, so the wife claims, Wat
! son called on her intoxicated and brought
j her whisky which he "induced her to
i drink, thereby destroying the effects of
i the treatment Bhe was receiving for a
' liquor disease that Watson caused her to
I contract."
The wife alleges that her husband is
receiving $250 per month salary as buyer
for wholesale houses and she asks that
I he be ordered to pay her $60 per month
' alimony and $150 to retain an attorney
pending the action.
In the divorce suit of Mary Dinslaga
against Herman Dinslage, plaintiff to-day
I applied for an order of court directing
defendant to pay her a reasonable amount
for co3ts, attorneys fees and for support
and maintenance of self and infant pend
ing the trial of the divorce suit. Mrs.
Dinslage avers in her complaint that in
! August lSitS, her husband calne home and
"punched bit and kicked her," and locked
her out of the house. The parties were
married in San Francisco two years ago,
I but their lappiness was of short dura
' tion for accon'rtng to the complaint,
! shortly after the marriage Dmslage
caught his wife talking to a French
baker, when he struck her in the face.
Divorce suits were commenced in the
; Superior Court to-day by Josephine M.
Dickson against Albert M. Dickson and
G L Noble against Harriet R. Noble,
desertion being alleged in both cases as
1 the grounds for cause of action also
Gertie M. McLane against Charles H. Mc
i Lane on the ground of cruelty, and Emma
Ketchum against G. H. Ketchum for fail
ure to provide.

BEAUTIFUL SERVICES USHER
IN THE JEWISH NEW YEAR
Rabbi Nieto Delivers the Rosh Hoshonah Sermon at Sherith Israel.
ROSH HOSHONAH was celebrated
splendidly yesterday morning in
the Jewish temples of the city.
All were crowded to the doors
with devout worshippers pouring
out their thanks to God for the |
ijtssings and asking his forgiveness for
he errors of the past twelvemonth. The
sound of the shofar was the signal in j
learly every place of worship for a musi- j
cal programme of unusual excellence.
At Temple Emanu-El, the congregation |
vas distinctly fashionable and seemed to
â¢vince tho most lively hopes for happi
less during the new year. The service
lad been planned on a grand scale and j
he sermÂ«m was by no means the least
nteresting feature. Rabbi Voorsanger j
lad chosen for his subject "The Lion
md the Vine. 1 taking bis text from* the
lineteenth chapter of Kzekiel, where that
prophet likened the Princes of Israel of
lla time to lion's whelps taken captive in I
i pit, and Judea to a wasted vine. Under
bat head Dr. Voorsanger took to ta^-k
.hose people of his religion who seemed |
;b accept that religion merely from habit
Â»nd tradition, pointing out to them that
heir duty was to stand forth as the lion's
.vhelps, and aid their aged mother in her
aour of need. He said In part:
Ezekiel addresses himself to s.,prlnca,
who was â¢ too weak to hold the scepter...
and tells him: "What a lioness was. your
mothtT." Her ambition was that- you should
become a lion, but the nations set up
atalnst you, and they put a. ring Into your . I
oose ana led you captive Into Egypt.";
1 say to you this parable of Kztltlel Is a ;
perspective of history. We are of the chil
dren ol the lioness. rhc heavenly sign .if
Judea i- the lion. A rampant lion is j
Ju'Jpi, not crouching: and waiting for the ;
.-Injil The heavenly sign of tin; lion is one â 
oi strength, power and dominion, which
has neon borrowed trum .ludea by other
nations, who HkewUe strive- for succens
by ihe sign of the Hon. A lioness Is our i
mother. We belong to her and she feeds
v..- She roams the earth to seek for sus- !
tenance lor us; and the matins of if. .
lion and the lioness of Judea and Judaism
has produced power and >'. minion and
Avorld-conijuering iilc^p. .
Wo are the children of the lioness, but
t'.ir.i: of us take her i complacently, as a
matter of course, t>f tradition and train
ing. &he la our mother, and, of course, a :
man does not want to investigate ins
mother. Although 'that mothor may be '
growing elder, me of us do not pee it.
This day comes to us as a day of glad- j
ness. The shofar sounds the message:
'â¢Make the best of yourselves; be the !
best you can be; contribute your best to ;
society: contribute to the Happiness of ,
mankind; Corset yourselves tor a while
and study the conditions of the eternal
progress that is man's part through the ]
ages."
Shall a man love his faith merely be
cause it was his lather's? Shall the ex
istence of Judaism be determined merely
by the fact that we are descended from
Jewish people? 1 am bound to tell you
that taking such questions Is piaying into
the hands of the anti-Semite. The anti- I
Semitic philosophy Is that the Jew cannot !
lie anything else. They say that his rellÃ- j
lon is a matter of birth, habit and educa
tion; that he cannot change himself; that !
nature has made him what he iiÂ«. and.
therefore, he cannot be other than a Jew.
Shall 1 express my loyalty to my faith
merely because my mother did It, or my 'â 
lather did it? Is my religion merely a j
/oree of habit? Is my faith merely a tra
dition? Is it a fact that I am merely con
trolled by circumstanceâ that I would have I
no right to choose? Suppose that my rea-
Eonlng and logic come to different con
clusions, what am I to do?
What Is the ansWer to such questions? j
The answer to them . is "Thy mother was
a vine planted by many waters, her boughs
extending and her tendrils closing around i
her trunk so high that they overtopped all
other vines." There is within her every
source for satisfaction, She is the source
net only of the power of her own children,
but of the wisdom that runneth through
the centuries. Â.
' Such questions proceed oftentimes from
people who are not quite willing to say j
what their duty to their mother isâ the i
people who have forgotten that the vine of I
Israel la still planted by many waters, and !
that its rich clusters are still envied â by |
many neighbors. They prefer the other
*ldfcf the picture. There are two pic- i
ture* of the vine. One is a vine rooted '
deeply, >x tending Its fruity riches to the
world. The other picture Is the vine of â¢
Ifracl planted in the desert, its fruit
wasted, the simoon blowing upon it and i
scourging it; its trunk withered, no longer I
to become thi scepter of nations. There are
nlentv of people who flatter themselves
that that tfi the fact We know them..Lis
ten 'to these complacent gentlemen, who
eeem to remember no more where their
m Yn h v r know the lioness has lost sen*
tpeth: and yon know that. hex eyes .do not
rhine as brightly os of old; and you know
that there ere many people who look upon
her with some degree of contempt: aaÂ«J ]
you know that they have endeavored time
and again to put a ring- in her nose and
lead her captive In the streets .\nd thor
oughfares of the cities, in order that they
may deride the old lioness who seeks ffr
hpr prey all through the world.
I tell you that is just the time when
she needs her children. Do our mothers
need us when we are babies? No. They
need us when we are strong 1 and they are
weak and old. That is the time when
these complacent gentlemen will turn their
backs and say: "That is all nonsense.
Give us the principal issues of the day.
Let us struggle, let us endeavor to suc
ceed, and let us try and make the world
forget that we belong to these children ot
the lioness. Let us try to ohiige our
Bpeech and try to alter the fashion of i ne
logic so that the world may, at least as
far as we are concerned, fors^t that we
belong to the old mother.
Gentlemen, the world will never fors't
it. You may try to hide in the bowel? or
the earthâ the world will never terse: thai
the old lioness has children in 1" ,'yi't and
in Babylon, In France and Italy and in
America. Make no apologies for your
mother. Stand with your mother to-day.
- and tell the world that the old lioness is
still alive and hopes under God to con
tinue her mission.
And "unto those that may auk such cow
ardly questions I would say they are mis
taken. They flatter themselves that Juda
ism Is a rotting tree, a thing of contempt
that n^eds to be burled in the sands of
time. She is a vine planted by 'nany wa
ters, fhe is rejuvenating herself. She la
expanding her boughs, and unto her chil
dren â¢ she will be the same nourishing
: mother that she has been in the past.
The musical portion of the service was
magnificent. The keynote in -which the
Jewish, festival services are- pitched con
sists of the musical portion of the wor
ship. "While the language of the! prayer
is frequently changed into the tongue, of
the people in whose midst the service is
held, the melodies which form the under
current to the songs have never* been
changed and are handed down to pres
ent generations intact just as they were
sung centuries ago and without having
been defiled by the revolutionary spirit of
the times. Naturally modern improve
ments in Instruments and voice culture
demand embellishments of the traditional
chant, and Cantor Stark of Temple
Emanu-El took it upon himself to com
pose a musical service' apparently new.
but never for a moment deprived of that
Oriental color which is so thrilling In
Hebrew worship.
Besides the traditional hymns, Mr.
Stark composed entirely original pieces,
among which, an orchestral work. "Song
of Devotion." stands out boldly. Thu
>â â  mposer exhibited the fine judgment of
impressive melody by assigning to the
cello the guiding strains. No other in
strument can embody the spirit of de
votion in such a realistic manner as this
one, which is nearest in character to the
human voice. The "Song of Devotion" is
ally a cello solo with orchestra accom
paniment. ...
Another composition which was of ar
tistic value was the "Sen Sheorim" (un
fold the portals). Herein Cantor Stark
showed his advanced knowledge In theory
and harmony. It contains not only a
splendid figure, but is arranged with so
much taste and such a strict adherence
to the slightest detail that it becomes a
classical work. The traditional character
of the music was particularly manifest in
the recitative "Elohentl," wherein the
dramatic barytone of Cantor Stark had
an opportunity to exhibit its full force.
The chant was rendered with a dramatic
fervor and impressive â¢ execution which
embodied the ideal of devotion.
Inasmuch as the Shofar service is the
emblem, as It were, of the Hebrew New
Year's worship, the music embodied
therein must be erjiipl to the importance
of the occasion. The Shofar (ram's horn)
was represented by the more modern
trombone. While this substitution of the
modern instrument destroyed the tradi
tional wail of the ram's horn. Cantor
Stark endeavored to bridge over this
change by a striking chorus erected upon
the unique sounds of the shofar.
Before the sermon Schubert's "Great Is
Jehovah", was sung by the choir, and
Rhys Thomas rendered the tenor 1 solo
with much taste. The choir consisted of
sixteen members, among whom were the
following soloists: Miss Daisy Colin, Mrs.
J. Kelly, Rhys Thomas- and Homer â  S.
Henley. W. A. Sabln presided at the or
gan. An orchestra of twelve pieces as
sisted in the service.
At the Temple Sherith Israel. Post acd
Taylor streets, the congregation was no
less fashionable than at Emanu-El, and
the musical service, conducted by Cantor
Davis. was of a high order. - Rabbi Nieto
delivered the New Year sermon under the
title "Agitation la the Camp," and dealt
largely, after an introductory explanatory
of the day. its hopes and duties, with the
question of Zionism.. On this subject he
said: - â  â¢â â St.;:; 1 ; â â¢ . < â '-

Hi :â â¢ Hebrew lÂ» the cry on one hand,
while on the other the plea la for prayer
In a language that is intelligible to the
pei pie. One faction declares that the
foundations of our faith are being torn
away, while those complained of seem
anxious to build up a pure religion free
from all meaningless contrivances and ar
chaic formula.". Every section of the com
munity is on the tiptoe of expectation.
All seem to apprehend the advent of some
dire catastrophe. Whence will it come?
Krom without or within? Will the national
question, under the euphonious title of
7.\< nism, or the ritual and ceremonial yarl
a'.nnp precipitate the unfortunate crisis?
Shall we ourselvea hurl faction against
faction to no profit, or will the non-Jew
fatten upon us the responsibility of some
matter outside our consciousness and rsn
dir us anew martyrs to the cause of jus
tice?
It is all very well to take a survey of
the conditions at any particular period
and descant upon them. Discovering popu
lar diseases prevalent in any era is as old
as the hills. The more Important duty
should be to so thoroughly diagnose . the
disease that we may decide beyond the
shadow of any reasonable doubt the cause
or causes of the fevered condition. To pre
scribe palliatives Is but to pniUpone the
fearful ravages of a dlsf-ase strengthened
by neglect.
Our duty Is to determine the causes that
have produced this feverish condition In
the Jewish community and remove them,
or, falling their removal, to adopt such
measures as shall nullify their effects and
render them Innocuous.
The Synagogue Beth-Israel, on Geary
street, between Octavla and Lagnna. was
crowded yesterday morning with mem
bers of that congregation to attend the
Kosh Hpshonah services. In the congre
gation were a large number of Jewish
soldier boys who had served their coun
try in the" Philippines. Rabbi Levy's ser
mon was entitled "Sayings of the Sages."
He said in part:
"Blffsed art thou, O Lord God, sover
eign of the world, who hast kept us alive
and sustained us to enjoy this day."
This benediction was always recited by
Israel on the approach of a new season,
and if ever the necessity existed for such
a benediction that occasion Is ours to-day,
for notwithstanding the dark clouds that
occasionally obscure the sun's brightness
the fanatical hatred is melting away, tol
erance manifests Itself in religious circles,
and the dawn of a better and a purer de
cade is looming up before us.
While It is an indisputable truth that
much of the misery that exists Is beyond
man's control, still It is reasonable that
as dependents on the grace of God we
should congregate to supplicate that hid
den power and pray to the author of cre
ation to continue in unfolding and devel
oping that which is noblest und best In
the human mind and heart and soul.
If during the past ;.<;ir conditions de
prived us of the privilege of more con
stant communion with the universal Father,
It la no degradation to our better natures
to entreat our Father and our King to
grunt us strength to try to do good.
Oh, may the advent of this new year
(jul'^kcn and strengthen within us an
earnest resolve to make it one of true
life. In the book Which God opens to-day
ea< - h may write his name; every act of
kindness, every thought of pity, even" dis
position to be merciful, will be claims to
registration. I,et us, therefore, try to
live, that if we could revise this book we
should find nothing to change. Let the ln
apiratlon of the day cause us to offer with
thankfulness and Sincerity this benedic
tion: Blessed art thou. o Lord God. sover
ereign of the world, who hast kept us
alive and sustained us to enjoy this day.
At the Bush-street synagogue Rabbi
Isidor Myers delivered the Rosh Jlos
honah sermon. Jle. said in part:
At tliiÃ season of the year the Jew is re
minded by the sound of the trumpet to
niustfr on his side the three armies and the
banners bearing respectively the words
"Penitence," "Prayer" and "Charity."
These and these alone can defÂ»nd mail from
his cn-atest enemies.

THREATENS TO LEAVE
SCHOOLS IN DARKNESS
COMPANY SHUTS OFF GAS
UNTIL BILLS ARE PAID.
Compromise Is Finally Effected by |
Auditor Wells Offering to Settle
for July and August.
The gas was turned off in every school
building in the city yesterday morning by
employes of the San Francisco (las and
! Electric Company, acting under orders
from President <"rockett. The latter
claimed he had been instructed to adopt
this course by the directors of the gas
company because their bills against the
School Department for the months of
July and August, amounting to $900, had
not been paid and because the estimated
appropriations for the present fiscal year
were not ample to pay their bills against
the city at the ordinary rate of con- j
sumption.
Mayor Phelan attempted to induce
President Crockett to rescind his order
and to defer further action in the matter
until after the 18th of this month, when
the tax levy for the year is to be tixed,
but the latter was obdurate.
Finally a conference was arranged be
tween representatives of the gas com
pany and the city, which was held in the
office of the Mayor during the afternoon.
President Crockett and Attorney Bishop
represented the corporation and the
Mayor and Auditor Wells the city. At
! this conference it developed that the
pressing grievance of the gas company
was that while its bills against the School
Department for July and August had been
| passed by the board) they had not been
sent to the Auditor and therefore the
company could not get Its money. Aud
itor Wells suggested an easy way out of
the dilemma by offering to pay the bills
If they were sent to him. Mr. Crockett
said if that were done the gas In the
school buildings would again be turned
on. The Mayor then sent for the biÃs
and handed them to the Auditor. Last
night the schools were lighted as usual.
But while the gas company succeeded
in collecting its account against the
School Department for the two months
referred to. thf-re is still a sum in the
neighborhood of $7000 contracted previous
to June 30 which it has not collected and
cannot collect because there is to money
and will be none with which to pay it.

EXTRA SESSION
OF THE REGENTS
TURNED DOWN
Gage Crumpled Card
of Colonel Denicke.
ANTICS OF THE EXECUTIVE
AN INCIDENT OF RECENT OCCUR
RENCE AT PALACE HOTEL.
One pi the University Trustees Will
Know Next Time How
to Approach the
-* Governor.
Colonel E. A. Denicke, regent of the
State University, companion of the Loyal
Legion, comrade of the Grand Army, and
ail around business man of excellent at
tainments, Is not yet fully posted as ;o
current events in the political world. A
few days since Colonel Denicke desired to
see the" Governor of California on import
ant business connected with the Stale
University. The regents deemed it emi
nently proper that a special meeting of
the board should be held to make fitting
arrangements to receive the notable
architects composing the jury to pass
upon the designs in architecture submit
ted under airs. Hearst's competitive
plans, and therefore Colonel Denicke was
authorized to see the Governor ana ask
that the regents be convened to consider
the subject. Â
Colonel Denicke sought by the ordinary
method of sending his card to the Gov
ernor's apartments in the Palace Hotel
to obtain an interview with the chief
executive officer of the State, but no
attention was paid to his card. The colo
nel, slightly annoyed but not discouraged
in his efforts to secure a special session
of the board, resolved to try another ave
nue to approach "His Excellency. Ac
cordingly he enlisted the co-operation of
a State officer of high standing. This offi
cer was asked to convey the colonel s
card and telephone number to the Gov
ernor and also to express briefly the na
ture of the business on hand. Present. y
the Governor emerged from one of the
recesses of the Palace court. Behind
him glided Ed Niles and not far in the
rear distance was Al Lindley. The State
officer perceived an opening and at once
went forward and delivered to Gage the
earnest request of the regent and also
the card bearing the telephone number.
The Governor apparently listened to the
message, and for reply crumpled the card
in his hand and Bald: "I am going to
take the train for Los Angeles this even
ing "
In the matter of crumpling the card
and dismissing the topic! without the cour
tesy of response the Govejmor displayed
his individual force of character and
tirmneSÃ of purpose. He acted in the
premises without seeking the counsel of
Herrin or soliciting the consent of the
Mexican. When the touts saw him crum
ple the card they exclaimed:
"Gage has a mind of his own."
Certainly it would have been the proper
and graceful proceeding 'for the regents
in their official capacity to have welcomed
the eminent architects, but Colonel Dtii
ickp. versatile as he is. and as well verw <1
withal in the proprieties of social and oiii
! rial life, was not posted as to the proper
method to pursue in seeking an audience
with the present Governor of Californ.a,
and therefore the plans for official wel
come miscarried.
Had Colonel Denicke kept pace with
the administration he would have known
before the Incident closed that the assis
tance of Ed Niles or Al Lindley should
have been Invoked to obtain an audience
with "His Excellency." Next time he will
know better, but when that time comes
the regent may not care for the company
of the Governor.
Gage's recent antics here caused so
much unfavorable comment that oven
Judge Carperiter has been constrained to
apoligize for the Chief Magistrate. Car
penter's apology is not what would be
called a labored exposition of the case.
He simply explains the situation by the
remark: "Gage is a damned fool." Car
penter, it seems, will never correct the
unfortunate habit of saying what other

I grand generalissimo, left this city for
Louisville, Ky., for thÂ« purpose of en
gaging headquarters for the California
Templars, who will attend the triennial
conclave to b^ held in that city. While
there they were received by De Molay
! Comfna naery . and on the night of the
27th ult. were entertained in the Scottish
Right Cathedral. They were, welcomed
by about 150 Sir Knights, who had as
] sembled to do honor to the visitors from

PLUCKY SCHOOLTEACHER
DEFIED THE RAILROAD
Maintained Her Rights as a Passenger, De
clined to Be Ordered About and Would
Not Yield Her Seat.
The men who are now managing the
passenger traffic of the Southern Pacific
Company are either indifferent about the
comfort and convenience of the public
or else they are incompetent to discharge
the duties of the positions they hold.
The presence of so large a number of
visitors from the interior in San Fran
cisco during the week of festivities in
honor of the returned California volun
teers seemed to completely demoralize the
train service. On some of the divisions
in the vicinity of San Francisco trains
were frequently as much as two hours
! late, and passengers were crowded into
1 cars without ..ny consideration for their
! rtentp and comfort. It is reliably stated
i. -at the company had an unpleasant ex
perience with a Cplusa County teacher
who knew her rights and was determined
to maintain them, and as a result of halt ,
an hour's parley the corporation uncon
! dltionally surrendered to the plucky
I young woman. .. _,
Sunday afternoon, August 27, the Sac
â  ramento train was nearly an hour late
In leaving the Oakland mole. It consisted
of three iirst-c-lass passenger coaches and
ten second-class coaches, all of which
were well tilled. Just before the train
arrived at Port Costa the passengers In
the last three cars were directed to va
cate and find seats or standing room in
the remaining seven cars But few of
those ordered io move could nnd seats.
The aisles were crowded and some were
compelled to stand upon the platforms.
The Colusa County school teacher refused
to leave the cars to be cut out of the
train unless the conductor provided her
with a seat. The conductor, who was
acting under orders, was very considerate
and polite, but a bmkeman was threaten
ing and blasphemous until the teacher
threatened to report him, after which he
j subsided. Tho conductor reasoned, impor
j tuned and expostulated, _ut all to no
| purpose, as the young lady refused to
i budge except on the condition above
named.
The pretense was made that the car
needed repairs, but as two other cars
j were also cut out of the train she was
quick to perceive that this was' a mere
pretext to gain a point. The car was
finally sidetracked and the door locked,
! but ihe conductor was warned by the
I teacher that if she was left she would
I sue the company for damages. The con
â  due-tor went away but came back again
i and after another short but ineffectual
1 parley a switch engine pushed the car on
' ! the ferry boat and it was again coupled
to ihÂ«' train.
The surrender was complete and un
conditional. The young lady knew her
rights and was plucky enough to insist
that, having purchased a ticket and ob
: talned a seat at the OaKland mole, she
I was entitled to hold it to her destination.
1 After the uusual episode was over the
â  passengers who were witnesses crowded
â  about the young woman and warmly con
' gratulated her upon having achieved so
. notable a triumph.
