CAPE TOWN, Wednesday, Nov. 8, night.âDis
patches from Kimberley show that the town was vig
orousiy attacked ut two different points. It is re
ported that one of the British force and six Boers
were killed. It is believed here that the Boers sur
round the town in force.
DURBAN, Natal, Wednesday, Nov. Bâ The war
ships have landed a naval brigade with twenty guns
for the defense of the town. The brigade marched
through the town amid the greatest enthusiasm,
LONDON, Nov. 1 1. â As each day and each week of the war
draws to a close without a decisive action at Ladysmith
probability that the Boers will risk an assault upon that
garrison becomes, it is said, more and more imminent, in fact
it i^ claimed that the campaign seems to have reached a stage
where it is absolutely necessary for the Boers to deliver a telling
â¢ke. Unless they decide to do this their only alternative is to
retire within their own lines and strengthen themselves against
the impending onslaught by superior numbers. That the latter
course will be followed without first making a determined at
tempt to oust or capture General White seems beyond all rea
son, for the methodical isolation of General White's force indi
cates that the campaign has been carefully prepared and the
main objective definitely fixed. Even if the Boers have already
' ivered that they have underrated General White's capabil
ity of resistance it is thought scarcely likely that they will give
up their expected supremacy without a desperate struggle. It
is too late for them to change the main objective. .Mobile as
are the Boers they could scarcely transfer the body of their
forces, which are at present concentrated about Ladysmith, to
any other vulnerable point without running the risk of encoun
tering superior numbers, which are already pouring northward.
Moreover, any weakening of the Boer force at Ladysmith would
give General White a splendid opportunity of attacking, and,
even against overwhelming odds, he has shown no hesitation in
accepting every opening for assuming the offensive.
The Boers must know just as well as the military authori
ties that twenty-three transports will arrive in South Africa be
fore November 18. They must also realize that their time is
short, for in the present emergency it is believed General Bul
ler will not wait to organize an army corps, but will content
himself with rushing to the front every regiment he can dis
of.

Among the military rritics what is most

this score the Naval and Military Record

AN EXPERT'S
OF THE WAR SITUATION
LONDON, Nov. 11.â Reviewing the mil
itary situation as it stands to-day the
military expert of the Westminster Ga
zette says:
"It is hardly too much to say that the
attention of the civilized world is now
fixed on the situation at Ladysmith. On
the developments of that situation in the
immediate future rest our hope of speed
ing the conclusion of the war. If Sir
George White can maintain his position
up to November 26, or pertiaps a day or
two longer, the danger in Natal will be
ended. Should he fail to do so he will
be compelled to abandon his guns and
stores and r^tiro with heavy loss to the
southward, only to be brought up by
broken bridges and Boer forces In posi
tion on Tugela River.
"It is impossible to predict what may
happen. In considering the situation, to
put it shortly, the weak point in White's
position is that our men and horses must
be enduring daily an ordeal which can
not improve their fighting efficiency.
Though we are told provisions are in
plenty, yet there is danger that the am
munition, especially ammunition for his
big guns, may run short.
"Pnder these circumstances it is now
clear that Sir Redvers Duller has deter
mined to send Lord Methuen's division,
consisting of the Guards Brigade, under
Sir. W. Colvllle, and the English Brigade,
under Major HiMyard, to Durban, with
orders to break through the Boer south
ern OUtpoats at. Pietermaritzburg or at
Colenso, and joia hands with General
White. Unfortunately, the assembly of
this division at Durban will be a matter
of some little time."
In discussing the reported acts of
treachery on the part of the Boers, the
Westminster Gazette's military corre
spondent proceeds:
"When an act, which must necessarily
brand the perpetrator with infamy, is de
liberately committed with no possible ex
cuse of hot blood or 'if turmoil and con
fusion of a great battle, we are entitled
to assume that such obloquy would not
be incurred without some prospect of
great and immediate advantage. What
possible advantage could the Boers gain
from the destruction by artillery fire of
a number of refugees whom they had just
handed over to our charge, doubtless with
tlie object of embarrassing General White
with a number of additional mouths to
fee,!? It must also be remembered that
these Boer gunsâ for the allegation is dis
tinct that the outrage was committed by
guns and not by riflemenâ are mounted
BULLER REPORTS THE KILLING

ALIWAL NORTH DESERTED
AND DEFENSELESS
CAPE TOWN. Nov. 7â lt Is reported
that a Boer force from Smithfield has
crossed the frontier at Bethulie. It is
estimated to be 4000 strong, with field
guns. The latest advices are that the.
Boers had not entered Aliwal North yes
terday, but that the Besstekral force of
Boers was momentarily expected. It is
said the Boers have already captured
some police and others on the nut skirts
of the place and that Aliwal North is de
serted and defenseless.
The railroad has boon cut at Vryburg,
two stations south of Aliwal North.
Another Boer force is reported to have
marched past Burghersdorp toward
QueenÃtown.
The Transvaal contingent, which was
expected to joint the Free Staters be

ABSOLUTELY DESERTED
ESTCOTTVT. Natal, Tuesday, Nov. 7.â
An armed train manned by an engineer

Fuslleers under Captain HetlSley returned
here to-night. It reports that it found tho
stores at Frere looted, apparently by Kaf
lirs, and met. cyclist patrols, who r< ported
that the Boers were on the Springfield
rond, five miles away. The train pro
ceeded cautiously and found the Blue
spruit bridge intact.
Tin' train frequently stopped and Cap
tain Hensley examined the road ahead be
fore proceeding. Nearing Colenso, t'ap
tain Hensley inspected Fort Nicholsen
and proceeding found the line cut a mile
south of Colenso. Two lengths of rail on
each line had been lifted and placed out
of gauge. From information obtained
from Kaffirs, it appears that the Boers
left the vicinity of Colenso early this
morning, proceeding in the direction of
the Buluwan Mountain, and that Captain
Hensley found Colenso absolutely de
serted. A balloon was observed for sev
eral minutes hovering over the Boer posi

QUEEN VICTORIA TALKS
TO DEPARTING SOLDIERS
LONDON. Nov. It.â Sunshine so bril
liant that it compelled Queen Victoria to
resort to a sunshade for protection greet
ed her Majesty's return to Windsor this
morning, when she inspected three de
tachments of the Household Cavalry
hound for South Africa. The Royal Horse
Guards and the Second Life Guards had
journeyed up from London, joining the
First Life Guards. Amid scenes of great
enthusiasm the troops formed in two
lines, unmounted, in khaki uniform. An
immense crowd of people witnessed the
assembly. Brigadier General Trotter, the
district commander, with his full staff,
conducted the inspection. After the march
past the officers were ordered to the front
and the men were formed in a mass, close
to the royal carriage.
Then addressing Colonel Need, in a
voice plainly audible to the officers, the
Queen made a speech. She said:
"I've called you here to-day, my sol
diers*, who are always near me, to say
farewell before you cross the seas to a
distant r^art of my empire to assist your
comrades who are fighting so bravely for
your sovereign and country. I know you
will always do your duty as heretofore,
and 1 pray God to bless you and give you
a safe return."
After tlie speech h<- Majesty beckoned
to Colonel Need, and when be advanced
the Queen shook hands heartily with him.
The colonel assured lit r Majesty that she
: could depend on the Guards to uphold the
1 honor of the Queen and the country. Col
; onel Need then led three cheers for the
Queen, and 500 helmets were raised high
on the points of swnrds and carbines. The
cheers were repeated again and again,
and the band struck up "God Save the
Queen," her Majesty driving off amid the
cheers of the spectators and the troops

News From South Africa Indi
cates That the Boer Invasion
of Northern Cape Colony Has
Been Commenced in Karnest.
Detachments Go Around to the South of Ali-
wal North and Destroy Communication
by Cutting the Telegraph Line and
Tearing Up the Railway.
LONDON, Nov. ii. â To-day's news from South Africa in
dicates that the Boer invasion of the eastern part of North
ern Cape Colony seems to have begun in earnest last Tues
day. On that day a Boer commando was moving in the neigh
borhood of Aliwal North. Detachments had gone round to the
south of the town, as the telegraph line had been cut and the
railway torn up, destroying communications. Boers were seen
close to De Aar on the same day. Colesburg also reported the
invading forces approaching.
Confirming this advance of the Boers come dispatches to
the Secretary of State for War to-day with news of a skirmish
near Belmont, eighteen miles north of the Orange River station,
on the Kimberley line, in which Colonel Cecil Keith-Falconer
was killed and four lieutenants were wounded. As Belmont is
fifty-three miles south of Kimberley as the crow flies and eighty
six miles north of De Aar by the same measurement, it would
appear that a strong force of Boers has established itself on the
main line of communication from Kimberley south to Hope
town, De Aar and Cape Towti.
The wounded officers include some of the North Lanca
shire Regiment. It is not stated what was the British column's
strength, but it is believed it was probably a full battalion com
posed of the North Lancashire Regiment and Northumberland
Fusileers. This information is the first that has been received as
to the whereabouts of the Northumberland Fusileers since they
landed. It is clear that the Boers are assembling on the Orange
River in great numbers, and everything points to this district
becoming eventually the theater of fierce encounters.
The absence of fuller news from this region is taken to in
dicate that something important is happening there. It is quite
likely that before long developments there will throw the Lady
smith situation wholly into the shade.
Durban is now the center of preparations for the relief of
Ladysmith. A naval brigade from the cruiser Terrible has been
landed. Other warships either in port or expected shortly will
do the same. Within a week fully six thousand men will arrive
on transports and the forward movement to reinforce General
White will begin.
No news of any further fighting in Ladysmith has been re
ceived so far. As is known Ladysmith can hold out as long as
required. It is stated that there are unexpected stores there,
which will astonish the Boers when they deliver their attack. In
the meantime the guns sent up to defend the town are silent,
either because they have not been successfully mounted or from
a desire to husband ammunition. Efforts are being made to
restore communication by means of the heliograph.
loaders are claimed to be of a superior
character and expected to be particularly
serviceable in removing the Boers from
the hills.

LONDON, Nov. 11.â Tho raising of the

bidding fair to be successful, has been
marked by some division of feeling in the
American colony. It has been learned
that several Americans have declined to
contribute, for while sympathizing with
the object, they said they believed the
methods of raising the subscription had
resulted in much obnoxious social, busi

official in London said to a representative

LONG LOST DAVIS
WILL IS FOUND
Was in the Custody of Miss
Wilson, Who Now Offers It
for Probate.
OMATIA. Nov. 11.â The lons-lost will of Multi-millionaire Andrew J. Davis of
Butte, Mont., came to light to-day. This will has been sought for ten years
almost, and will now be offered for probate in the courts of Butte, Mont. There
is a woman in the rase, and she is after her share of the Davis millions. Her
name is Mary C. Wilson and she resides in <"'hicago. The case is given to the
public through an Omaha attorney, W. A. Saunders, who leaves here to-morrow
fur Hutte to tile the will for probate.
Mr. Davis was one of the wealthiest men of Montana, and when he died In
the spring of 1890 his estate was valued at $6,000,000. The latest will found was
dated In LB6&, and the heirs immediately plunged into litigation. The case was
in the court more than six years and some of t lie most prominent lawyers of the
country were engaged on each side. James M. Woolworth, president of the
American liar Association, and Colonel Robert G. Ingersoll were engaged on the
i] some time. In^ersoll 13 said to have received more than $I<XI,OOO as his
fee. Various bequests are made in the will just brought to light. One provides
for (100,000 for ;i public library in Butte, Mont. Several relatives of the million
aire are mentioned for like amounts, among them being "My dear friend, Mary
C. Wilson of Chicago."
Miss Wilsons connection with the case extends back to 1889, when the alleged
ns paid to handsome young Miss Wilson by the 80-year-old millionaire
the talk of the town. Affairs came to such a pass that It was represented
is thai provision should be made for Miss Wilson and a lineal descendant.
Then it was that the will was made and intrusted to the care of the young
woman. Miss Wilson has made her home in Chicago for some years. No reason
is given by her for not filing the will earlier.
Other bequests under the will are made to Henry A. Root, a nephew, residing
in NÂ«-w York: Erwin Root of New York, $100,000; Mary Louise Dunbar, residing
near Springfield, Mass., $100,000; and $200,000 to Calvin Davis, a brother, supposed
to live In San Francisco.
The light for the property under the old will was carried on from ocean to
ocean, and now bids fair to have been for naught. Many side litigations eman
ated from the parent suit, and some of them are still In court
With the tiling of this will at Butte application will be made to admit It
to probate, and the appointment of an administrator will follow as a matter of
form.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLING
TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, Nov. 11.â
In order to prevent the escape of Agui
naldo from Bayombong, General Otia will
b end a tibn to capture Aparri, on
the north â  Luzon, ami, after es
tablishing Ita base at this port, the ex
pedition will be conveyed in cascos and
light draught vessels down the Rivar
Cagayan and Its tributary to Bayomboug.
<,r to whatever point at which Aguinaldo
may have established his headquarters.
This expedition probably will be under
command of Brigadier General Wbeaton,
who has occupied San Rafael ami is un
der orders to proceed against Dagupan.
Before dispatching him to Aparri General
Otis will reinforce his command, so that
it will be able to destroy any bands of
hostile natives that it may meet and have
ample force to crush Aguinaldo's army
when it is finally brought to bay.
erals Lawton and .due Arthur will so ar
range their lores as to keep Aguinaldo in
the north of Luzon until General VVhea
ton gets into position, when the three
commanders will bring their forces to
bear upon the point at which Aguinaldo
may be located.
Genera] <>Us is expected to send sev
eral tinclads with the expedition, as they
will be useful in protecting troops during
the passoge down Cagayan. It had been
expected that General Wheaton's expedi
tion would make a short cut across moun
tains to get to the north of Aguin
but General Otis lias concluded iliai the
wiser plan i.s to st-nd his command by
transports to tiie north of Luzon and to
have Generals Mac Arthur and Lawtou
guard the smith.
It has become evident to the officials
that it will be extremely difficult to catch
Agulnaldo. It is pointed out that with
the long coast line of the island it would
be an easy matter f.,r him to enter a
small sail boat and get away and naval
that if he is captured it
will be by the navy and nol by the army.
The departure of Aguinaldo from Luzon,
officials believe, would simplify matters,
as he is recognized as the head of the
insurrection and his absence would un
doubtedly greatly disorganize the rebels
and render the suppression of the Insur
rection all the easier.
Consider;) iiW- dl -atisfaction is felt by
the War Department at General Otis'
conduct with reference to the cable with
which it is Intended to connect Manila and
the military posts in the I'hilipplne archi
pelago. Although Brigadier General
Greely, chief of the signal service, began
preparations a year ago for laying a cable
In the Philippines, actual work has not
yet commenced.
The cable ship Hooker, carrying a cable
valued at $90,000, and cable instruments
valued at $26,000, was wrecked off Correg
Idor Island last June, and General Otis
cabled that she could be saved. Part of
the cabl<> was removed, but the remainder
and the Instruments were allowed to re
main in the ship, and it is believed here
that the Instruments are ruined. After
the vessel had lain on a reef for several
months General Otis finally made a con
tract for raising her. The work of the
wreckers is stated in this dispatch from
General Otis to-day:
"Impossible to save the Hooker. Con
tractor will save cargo. Quartermaster
will remove fittings of value. Sell wreck
at auction "
\\ I ether General Otis will place the
cable and cable instruments, If the latter
are still Qt tor service, on a transport
and direct thnt the work of laying the
line be commenced, the authorities do not
know.
The necessity of a military cable In the
Philippines is appreciated by the War De
partment. To the posts this Government
has established in the Sulu Islands mail
is sent only once a month, unless trans
ports be proceeding in their direction, and
this delay In communication is often most
embarrassing, and would be more so.
rtment officials say, if the insurrec
tion in Luzon :-h tuld extend to the Sulus.
Had General Otis, immediately after thÂ«
as wrecked, taken the necessary
precautions to save the valuable cable in
struments and to lit out another vessel to
lay the line, the officials believe that the
work by now would have been com
menced, and It would not have been long
before the cable would be in operation.
General Otis has not communicated his
plans respecting the cable to the depart
ment.

SANTA CRUZ POWDER
MILL AGAIN BLOWS UP
Patrick Hughes, a Workman, fll iss
ing, and Was Probably Killed.
Special Dispatch to The Coll.
SANTA CRT'Z, Nov. 12. -The people of
Santa Cruz were awakened this morning
early at 12:15 by a terrific explosion at the
powder works. Swinging doors and creak
ing of glass plate windows occurred. The
report was the loudest ever experienced
by the people of this city, as the glaze
mill, where the explosion occurred, Is sit
uated in the lower flat, a mile below the
Othi r v.orks.
â¢ â  c man, Patrick Hughes, Is missing.
He Is the only man at work at night in
this part of the powder works. He is
night watchman, and as the glaze mill
almost runs itself it is his duty to visit
it only at stated times.
About five thousand pounds of blasting
powder went up, as this mill is where the
finishing touches are put to the powder.
It is hauled from the Corning mill in the
upper flat to the glaze by tram cars for a
mile. There is always on hand one cylin
der of powder, which consists of forty
barrels, and each barrel contains 125
pounds.
GENERAL OTIS TELLS OF
MOVEMENTS OF TROOPS
WASHINGTON, Nov. 11.â Three impor
tant dispatches from General Otis were
ed at the War Department to-day,
showing the hardships and difficulties en
countered by our troops in their advance,
and giving a captured insurgent dispatch
showing the line of argument put forward
to sustain the insurrection. The dis
patches are as follows:
"MANILA, Nov. 11.â Severe typhoons
over Panay the last two days impeded the
marcn of General Hughes' troops. His
column Is several miles north of the west
of Iloilo. The insurgents have aban
doned sirnng defenses In that direction."
â â¢.MANILA. Nov. 11.â Lawton is pushing
troops through on the Lupadlmgan and
San QuenUn roads, but the country is
submerged. The bridges and recently
constructed rafts were washed out, and
wheel transportation cannot move. His
reliance is on cavalry, a few infantry
mpn and native scouts living mostly in
the country. Mac Arthur commenced an
early advance this morning. Yesterday
two companies of the Seventeenth Infan
try, under Chynoweth, making a recon
noissance on the Malalong and Concep
tion roads, struck a battalion of the en
emy, which left twenty-nine dead on the
field. Our casualties are reported as three
wounded."
'â¢MANILA, Nov. 11.â A number of offi
cial in.surgt nt dispatches were captured
yesterday by General Young's troops in
the north and forwarded by Lawton last
night. They indicate the directed aban
donment by the enemy of the country in
the vicinity of Cabanatuan and San Jose,
and hurried movements by way of Tay-
Ing over the mountains to Bayon, thence
to Afiirra. Among the dispatches the fol
lowing appears:
" 'TARLAC, Nov. s.â Otis did not accept
mir proposition. The enemy attacked out
posts because Otis promised McKlnley to
take Tarlac to-day. Think they cannot
)'iÂ»-;ik through. Take care of the prison
ers, as therein lies our great hopes, espe
clally for our wives. The Spanish Com
missioners tried to deceive us, dealing
with us as insurgents. Our government
sent them away and they withdrew
greatly displeased. The quadruple alll
ance between Germany, France, Russia
and Spain is a fact. Before December we
will know our fate. Throughout Europe
there Is sympathy for our cause, and the
American Democrats are clearly in our
favfjr. They are sure of Bryan's triumph
at the next election. Pay attention to
your affairs and never mind the rest.' "

DEGENERACY DUE TO
FOOD ADULTERATION
Professor Hart Tells a Senate Committee
That the Human Race Is
Retrograding,
NEW YORK, Nov. 11.â Senator W. E. Mason of Illinois, of the United
States Senate Committee on Manufactures, began a session of the committee
here to-day. The committee adjourned until Monday at 10 a. m., when Sena
tors Wetmore of Rhode Island and Harris of Kansas, the other members of
the committee, will be in attendance.
The subject of to-day's examination was the adulteration of beer, ale and
porter. Only two witnesses were called. They were Gallus Thomann of the
local Beer Brewers' Association and Professor Herbert W. Hart. Mr. Tho
mann said that the brewers of the United States were much opposed to any
adulteration of beer and spoke of the disinclination of the brewers to send
exhibits to the forthcoming Paris Exposition. They argued, he said, that
without using preservatives it would be impossible for them to send beer
that would compete with the product of local brewers.
Questioned by Senator Mason Mr. Thomann said he believed that the
foreign beers imported here in bottles were preserved by antiseptics, prob
ably salicylic acid. Mr. Thomann said that the sale of beer so preserved
was forbidden in Bavaria, but there was no law preventing the preserva
tion of beer for sale without the country.
Professor Hart declared that every college should have a chair of dietet
ics. He said the persistent adulteration of all classes of food was respon
sible for the present degeneration of the race and would be responsible for
a future generation of idiots.
White bread Mr. Hart declared to be the scourge of humanity, and he
said he would sooner eat the cheapest bread made in the dirtiest part of
New York City than the best aerated bread manufactured. He advocated
the use of whole wheat bread and said that the appetite for beer was a
result of the craving of the system for the life-giving elements that are taken
from wheat by its manufacture into white flour.
Mr. Hart said that he would prohibit the use of glucose in beer and
that he would suggest a law compelling brewers to tell on their bottle labels
the component parts of the liquor in the bottles.
When the explosion occurred the lights
in the entire works, as well as the elec
tric lights in Santa Cruz, went out. and
the entire mill closed down. The work
men went to the place where the explo
sion occurred to remove the debris, etc.
The shock in the vicinity of the powder
works was very heavy and a number of
panes of glass in the windows of the ele
gant Peyton residence were broken.
Around the yard where the mill is sit
uated was a high board fence about fif
teen feet high, which was knocked flat
by heavy concussion.
This mill was a frame structure and
blew up a few years ago. At that time J.
Brown was in the mill and was killed.
The mill was situated within one hun
dred feet of where the Sacramento com
pany of California volunteers were en
camped when they guarded the powder
works during the Spanish war. It 1b
thought that Patrick Hughes was killed
in the explosion.

Feet Above the Ground.
Wlille out coon hunting- one night re

of branches by the aid of a pair of
climbers.
Ditton reached a branch almost at the
tnp of the tree, and attempting to adjusc
one of the climbers dropped it to the
ground nearly 100 feet below. He called
down to his companions, but they had
nothing with which to aid him. It was
bitterly cold up In the big tree, and Dit
ton's hands became so numb that it was
feared he would fall before help could be
summoned. While one of his companions
remained at the foot of the tree shouting
up words of encouragement the other
started off for assistance to the nearest
farmhouse, two miles distant.
After much searching another pair of
climbers were secured and with a long
rope the relief party started back. They
were lost in the woods, however, and it
was necessary to wait for daylight before
the imprisoned man could be reached
One of the party then ascended a neigh
bouring tree and managed to swing the
climbers across to young Ditton. who was
so cramped that it was with the greatest
difficulty he eventually reached solid

dry weather has made this pest Buffi
ciently vigorous to enable it to become
dangerous, whereas it would not be so
under different climatic conditions. Its
particular preference for alfalfa fields the
entomologists of Nebraska are not able
to explain. They do report, however, that
the pest does manifest a decided prefer
ence for this character of vegetation. The
body of the regular army worm, for in
stance, is smooth and devoid of hair, but
the "fall" army worm has sparse hairs
growing out from small black spots on
his body, giving it a much rougher ap
pearance. The fall army -worm also pos
sesses a whitish Y-shaped mark on the
head and differs from the other species
also by being a third smaller.
The State University has advised farm
ers to plow as deeply as possible in those
sections of the State where the new pest
has made its appearance. The worm or
dinarily eats the alfalfa down to the roots,
and many farmers fear the very root of
the plant Is rendered worthless by them.
There is some apprehension that this
worm will prove very damaging to the
winter wheat that has been put in. On
this point the university scientific men
have agreed and advised the farmers of
the State to be sure to keep the fields
free from weeds, that the moth may have
as little opportunity to propagate as pos
sible. This insect passes the winter, they
explain, in little cells just below the sur
face, and the breaking of these cells re
sults in the destruction of the eggs de
posited. -It is impossible to do anything
of this kind in the alfalfa fields unless the
farmers are prepared to lose in one sea
son the fields they have cultivated for
several years. Alfalfa culture has reached
enormous proportions in Nebraska the
past three years. To-day it is estimated
that of the 300.000,000 tons of hay pro
duced by the State this year, one-half
of the product, or nine-tenths of the cul
tivated grasses, was alfalfa. This indi
cates the importance of the crop that is
being threatened by the fall army worm.
In the sugar beet fields the worms have
been destroyed in large numbers by spray
ing the plants with paris green in strength
of one pound to 150 gallons of water. This
has been found very satisfactory, and,
would have been done in the alfalfa fields
had it not been found that dragging heavy
rollers over the fields appeared to produce
better results. In many counties of the
State both of these remedies, however,
have been tried and still the worms seem
to prosper, traveling from field to field in
their efforts to find something to eat. The
indications are that they will spread all
over the State unless stopped by cold
weather.â Correspondence of the Country

A DOG THIEF.
Strangely Enough, He Has a Pen
chant for Newspapers.
The Warren-avenue station police are
hunting for a thief that steals news, and
according to present indications it will
take the whole available force to catch
him.
The description of the culprit Is: "Tall,
four legs, two drooping ears and a long
tail." Residents of the neighborhood have
been annoyed by having their morning
newspapers stolen from their doorsteps.
Complaints became so frequent that a
special detective was detailed to watch
for and catch the thief. Wide awake and
alert as the detective was, it was a long
time before he learned how the newspa
pers were really stolen.
One morning as lie was watching the
residences near Oakley and Warren ave
nues, which is the locality where the pa
pers had regularly disappeared, he saw
a dog dash for a paper and run swiftly
away with it. So astounded w^ls he that
he forgot to give chase until the criminal
succeeded in getting away with his booty.
To the thefts of the dog the poiice now
ascribe all the complaints of newspapers
missing from doorsteps in this district. â

Recent Inventions.
A resident of Italy has patented a de- i
vice lor me prevention oÂ£ seasickness, ' i
comprising a belt to be strapped around :
the waist, with triangular pad attached ;
to the inner face, to prevent undue mo- i
tion or' me internal organs when the ship â 
rolls.
Onildren will find much pleasure in a
new go-cart which has a pair of oscillat
ing levers pivoted to the sides of the seat,
with rods leading to the front wheels lor :
attachment on me spokes, whereby the
operation of the levers .turns the wheels
anu propels the cart.
Electricity is used to operate the type
bars of a new typewriter, which has a
magnet set in position to operate the |
levers when the Keys are depressed a I
short distance, making it unnecessary to i
force the Key down for the full stroke.
An Improved piano stool can be raised
or lowered as desired without the neces
sity of revolving it to turn the screw, the
spindle being hollow and containing one
end of an i_.-shaped lever, which lias a '
head to lit in holes inside the vertical
base, in which the spindle slides.
By me use of a new key old railroad
spikes can be used in old spike holes, the j
key being formed of a strip of spring steel j
crimped along a portion of its length, to '
press alternately on the spike and the j
side of the hole, thus binding the spike !
in place.
Small change Is easily carried in a new
coin holder, which is formed of a piece of j
metal bent into V shape, with slots cut j
along the sides to tit the different sizes
of coin, a spring wire being placed across
the opening to prevent the coins from fall
ing out.
A New York woman has patented a
shirtwaist attachment which securely
holds a skirt in place, comprising a metal
plate to be screwed to the waist at the
ripht height to receive a pair of hooks at- :
tached to the opposite flaps of the skirt.
A German has designed a pocket knife !
which lias a lock to hold the blade in an
open or closed position, the pivot pin hav
ing a head at one end. In which is mount
i (1 a wire loop adapted to turn the pin in
either direction to lock or release the
blade.
How She "Guides Tnem."
There is a jolly mother in Brooklyn
who has several grown-up sons boarding
at home with her. and they declare she
want? to "boss" them all the time just
as if they were children. She laughingly
repudiates their charge, and declares
that she merely wishes to advise and
guide them, but has long ago ceased to
role them. Here is an example of the
way ?ho "guides" them:
At dinner the other night a bier meat
pio and a small roast duck were brought
on together. The duck was Intended for
the father, principally. The boys wi re
death on duck, their mother well knew
but it would not make a mouthful apiece
for them, so addressing the boy who sat
nearest her. she paid. "Which will you
have, Bobbie, duck or pie?"
"Duck." .said Bobbie promptly.
"No. Bobbie." answered his mother
cheerfully; "you can't have duck, dear.
Tak.-> your choice, my son, take your
choiceâ but you can't have duck!"â is'ew

LUTHER AS A HUMORIST
His Geniality Tempered the Acri
mony of His Zeal.
Zeal tipped with humor is what made
Luth.-r bo effective, says Samuel M.
Crothers in the Atlantic Magazine. He
struck heavy blows at the idols men
adored. But he was such a geniai. whole
souled iconoclast that those who were
ked at him couldn t help but
like himâ between times. He would give
a smashing blow at the Idols and t:
warm har.u-grasp and a hearty "God bless
you" to the idolater, and then idolater
and iconoclast would be down on the
her, trying to see if there were |
of the idol worth saving. It was ail so
shocking and yet su unaifectedly religious
, surprisingly the right thing to do,
that the upshot of it all was that people
went away saying that Dr. aMrtin wasn t
Mich a bad fellow after all.
Luther's Tabie Talk penetrated circles
which were well protected against his
theological treatises. Men were conscious
of a good humor even in his invective; tor
he usually gave them time to see the
kindly twinkle in his eye before he
knocked them down.
In order to engage Karlstadt In a con
troversy he drew out a florin from his
pocket and cried heartily: "Take it: At
tack me boldly:" Karlstadt took it, put it
in his purse and gave it to Luther. Luther
then drank to his health. Then Karl
etadt pledged Luther. Then Luther said,
"The more violent your attacks the more
I shall be delighted." Then they gave
each other their hands and parted.
One can almost be reconciled to theo
logical controversy when it is conducted
in a manner so truly sportsmanlike.
Luther had a way of characterizing a
person in a sentence that was much more
effective than hip labored vituperation <in
which it must be confessed he was a mas
ter). Thus, speaking of the attitude of
â i. "Erasmus stands look
tion like a calf at a new door."
It was very unjust to Erasmus, and yet
the picture sticks in the mind; for it" is
Filch a perfect characterization of the
king of mind that we are all acquainted
with, which looks at the marvels of crea
tion with the wide-eyed gaze of bovine
youthfulness. curious not to know how
that door came there but only to know
whether it leads to something to eat.
Americans Are the Most Polite.
A little party in the Michigan Central
station the other day fell into quite a se
rious discussion of manners, while they
waited for a train. One asserted that the
Frenchman is the most polite man on
earth. lie was contradicted by the second,
who stood up for the manly politeness of
the Englishman, while the third openly
declared that the American holds the
palm.
At this the others laughed. "The Amer
ican hasn't time to be polite," one of them
said.
Have you ever seen people of different
countries cross a muddy street and no
ticed what their manners are when they
meet a lady in the middle."
"No," they both replied.
"Well, this is what happens," went on
the third man: "The Englishman simply
bows and plods right alone through,
splashing mud all over the woman's skirt.
The German doesn't see her at all, but
plods and splashes; while the Frenchman
takes off his hat, bows low, with his hand
over his heart, and apologizes, but he
keeps right on splashing by. nevertheless.
Now, with the American It's different. Ho
looks up. sees the woman, steps to one
side in a puddle and stands very still until
she has passed." â Di troit Free Press.
Most Extraordinary Club
Mrs. Ada Brown Talbot of New York,
editor of the Clubwoman, says that the
extraordinary club sne ever ran
across is conducted by a demure and dig
nified little woman of 7, the daughter of a
club president. hTe editor called one day
and was received by her little friend with
open arms.
"At last I've got a chair,' she said.
"I am very glad, my dear," said the ed
itor. "I hope it is comfortable and pret
ty."
"Oh. it's not for me: it is for my club."
"I didn't know you had a club."
"Of course I have^-just like mamma.
My dolly is president, and I got the chair
for her. You see," she explained in a
whisper, "there's only dollies in It, and
the dolly that makes the most noise Is
president, just like mamma's club. That's
my dolly. She talks when you push her
back. I broked the spring, and now she
talks till sh-'s runned down. So she's
president. Dono't you think that's nice?' 1
And Mrs. Talbot said she did.âPhiladel

TWENTY-SIX INJURED
IN AN IOWA WRECK
Gravel and Work Train Come To-

Curve Near Dennison.
DENNISON, lowa, Nov. 11.âTwenty
six men were injured in a wreck on the
Fort Dodge and Omaha Railroad nine
miles north of Dennison this afternoon.
A gravel train, running extra, and a work
train containing 180 men came together
around a sharp curve at a deep cut in
the road.
Two of the injuredâ Ed McKee and Dan
OHrienâ are not expected to live through

fatally hurt.
Not a Success a Second Time.
In a well-known town in the Midland

very fond of practical jokes, and boro
the character of being "two cute 'uns."
Thfir cleverness, however, did not save
them from being "landed" with a bad
two-shiling piece.
A consultation took place between them
as to how to get rid of the false coin.
"Let's go to the theater," said one; 'It's
only sixpence to the pit. I'll try it, and if
I yet in all right you can pay and fouow
mo; we shall have our night's amusement
and be a shilling to the good."
"Agreed," Bald the other. No. 1 ten
dered his counterfeit coin at the doors of
the temple of the drama, which was taken
without examination. Is 6d being given
in change.
No. 2, seeing his friend had safely pass
ed the money box, went up gleefully and
put down the first coin he could take* from
hits pocket. It -was half a crown.
Imagine his consternation on receiving
the changeâ the bad two-shilling piece.â

BIG TRANSFER OF
TIMBER LANDS
Northern Pacific Rail-
way Sells Holdings.
EASTERN SYNDICATE BUYERS
WILL START SEVERAL MILLS
IN A SHORT TIME.
It Is Generally Believed That the
Effect of the Deal Will Be to
Advance the Value of Tim
ber Land.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, Nov. 11.â Standing timber of
Western Washington is wortli millions of
dollars more to-night than it was a week
ago. During the pasi week the Northern
Pacific Railway has sold to an Eastern
syndicate headed by Frederick Weyer
Hauser of Wisconsin its entire land hold
ings m Western Washington, consisting
of over a million acres of best timber land
in tho world. This is the largest sale of
timber lands ever made and will be far
reaching in consequence,
The immediate result is to take this
timber wi the. market, thereby limiting
the timber available for the present needs
ol sawmills. The purchase price has not
been made public, but undoubtedly ex
ce< ds $10,000,000, since there are single
townships m .Lewis and Chehalis counties
whose Umber is worth over $40u,(w0. The
purchase was made by the syndicate as
an Investment H will later start several
sawmills, including a large export mill
here.
The land is located in Snohomish, King,
Pierce, Lewis, Chehalis, Thurston, Cow
litz and Pacific counties, and is practi
cally all the patented timber lands owned
by th> Northern Pacific west of the Cas
cade Mountains. The deal has been on
for several months and many times has
been reported as consummated, only to
be denied by both Interested parties. In
Northern Pacific circles oven yesterday it
wa? claimed that the sale had not been
made, but that It was in process of negoti
ation. This assertion, however, may in- s^t
at rest, as in a telegram from Ashland,
\Vis.,.\ir. Weyerhauser confirms the report
i an interview says the transaction ig
simply in the nature of an investment. He
believes that timber is bound to advance
in the West and that he will realize Im
mense profits. This proves that the deal
has already bevn closed and the greatest
individual lumber transfer in history will
very i oon be mad< .
Local lumber men express much sur
prise regarding the price, which they con
sider far below the actual value of the
land. The acreage, it is said. Includes
some of the best timber in the State, and
is worth several times what Mr. Weyer
hauser is reported to have paid for it.

FOREIGN DEMAND
For American Apples Will Increase
the Shipments Enormously.
American apples are rapidly increasing
in favor abroad, and though as yet the ex- !
port figures show no increase over those
of lasl year, prices are up 60 per cent, and
tin-- trade is looking for enormous ship
ments that before February l mny break
the record ol the former Beasons. Apple
exporting t'i Europe does not start till
early In August, and tho comparatively
small figures thus far reached are no cri- .
terlon. Last year the Canadian ports i
shipped nearly twice as many barrels as I
New York, Boston and Portland together.
"This year," an apple exporter said. "New
York, Boston and Portland will ship three j
times ns many as Montreal and twice as i
many as Montreal ami Nova Scotia."
The situation is exceedingly pleasing to
the apple growers of America, in great
part Because of the small demand for
apples here. It is a famous fruit fall, and
there arc grapes and pears In abundance,
to mention no other fruits. The pear crop
la especially tino, and thus apples are ;
not In their usual domestic favor. As a
crop the apple yield promises about the ;
average, hardly more. It was thought
that it would be below last year's figure,
but later reports indicate much better re
turns than were expected in Western New
York, for example, and elsewhere. Vir
ginia Is getting to be the foremost apple
State, producing nowadays some of tho i
finest apples. Some of her trees yield six
and seven barrel fuls, where two barrelfuls |
is the average for a tree. There is a reo
ord of two Virginian trees having yielded
thirty-one barrels between them.
Exporting apples abroad last year was
far from being a success. More than a
million barrels went abroad, against a
trifle less than a million the year before
(the export record being 2,919,846 barrels
in 18HS-97, twice the figures of any other
season), but the shippers in many cases
lost heavily. The bulk of the shipments
(approximately 700,000 barrels) went from
Canada and Nova Scotia, and many own
ers of American orchards did not ship at
all.
"Canada kept on exporting all last
year," the veteran New York exporter,
Josiah Rich, said the other day, "because
she has no other outlet for her apples. She
cannot Bend them across the frontier to
this country, because the duty of 75 cents
a barrel eats up all the pront. Most of the
apples sent abroad last season were
Canadian. I advised all my principals not
to ship at all on account of the poor
prices."â New York Tribune.

A STRANGE AFFECTION
It Crop 3 Out Among Society Ladies
of the Afternoon Tea Habit.
There is a nervous diseaseâ the result of
the 5 o'clock tea habitâ which afflicts
many women, says the New York Herald.
Said one bright woman, lately:
"I never remember finishing a sentence
which I have commenced at one of these
functions. Before 1 have a chance to
round It off I am interrupted, dragged
away or confronted with a new face to
whom lam introduced. I begin again, to
have the experience duplicated again and
again. I have the same trouble with my
cups of tea. I put them down half
emptied to greet some new arrival, to find
them whisked away, and each one repeats
the history of its predecessor.
"I leave these 'bun worries' with a trail
of unfinished phrases and undrunk cups
of tea behind me. I go homa in a
thoroughly unkempt frame of mind, with
a tendency to leave off everything I un
dertake and start something fresh. It is
really a disease, a sort of 5-o'clock-tea
paralysis. Just listen at any of these re
ceptlons and you will agree with me. The
women talk in spasmodic, staccato gasps.
You never get tho point of a story or the
telling point of a biography. Every one
has her eye on the door for the new ar
rival, who may prove more interesting or
desirable than the one she is talking to.
'Pardon me.' seems to be the excuse
for every form of conversational rude
ness. I believe this form of nervousness
is one of me many symptoms of the- na
tional unrest, or lack of poise, of which
foreigners so bitterly complain."
By the time the average man gets old
enough to have good common sense he is
too old to use U to any advantaeo

DEMOCRATS LOSING HOPE

GOEBEL NEWSPAPERS (TEASE
MAKING CLAIMS.
>
Courier-Journal Says the Result Will
Be Determined by the Settle
ment of Questions of
Irregularity.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOUISVILLE, Nov. 11. â The official
â  count was resumed to-day. In about
sixty-five of the 119 counties it was com
pl< ted last night, and official returns were
; made. These, in net results, show a gain
I for Taylor. According to advices to the
Commercial (Rep.), he has a plurality of
2681. Chairman Long says the plurality
j will be over 3000. In Democratic circles,
i however, there is no disposition to con
j cede the Republican claims. Goebel says
â¢â  his plurality will be about 5000, and ad
vicea from the headquarters at Frankfort
I are to the effect that reports received
there from the count progressing bear out
, this claim. The Courier-Jaurnal, however,
; makes no claim of a plurality for Goebel.
I It says:
"The official count, as will be seen from
the returns published, makes many
Changes in the ngures heretofore reported,
and makes the result so close that the is
sue may be determined one way or the
other by the settlement of the various
questions of irregularity raised in the
I count. The count in some of the larger
j counties of the State has not been com
pleted, and in no cases have the boards
yet passed on contests."
The Times (Goebel Democrat) to-day for
the first time since the election omits the
publication of a claim that Goebel has re
ceived a plurality. The Post (anti-Goebel)
: asserts that Taylor will have a pluraliti
es frorp 3000 tv 4000. These figures are
il the same as the estimate made by
Staie Chairman Long.
FRANKFORT, Ivy., Nov. 11.â United
Siat.-.s Judge- Evans notified Commissioner
Chapman here that a special Federal
(s r.uid Jury will be convened in Louisville
to-day lo try ail cases of persons brought
. before it charged with Interfering with
, negro voters. Wingate Thompson, iiuford
Williams and Coleman Carr were hold
' over here in (1000 bonds on this charage.
They were Democratic election officers.
"Goebel by 1200 to 1600" is the claim
made at Goebel's headquarters to-day.
Several county boards adjourned yester
day until Monday, and it is claime-d that
they hope to make sufficient gains to off
set losses Goebel sustained in his own
and other counties yesterday. Chairman
Young. Democrat, wires that he has dis
covered gross frauds affecting the whole
vote in several mountain counties and
precincts In other counties, and on these
i it is supposed a contest will be made be
i fore the State Hoard if the final returns
from the counties should show Goebel not
elected.
LOUISVILLE, Ky., Nov. 12.â The Cour
ior-Journal at midnight figured out a plu
ral.;y of 15.". for Goebel. Thia is uased on
il reports from ninety-eight counties
ami unofficial from the remaining twenty
one. The County Commissioners of Nel
son, according to the Courier-Journal,
have thrown out 1198 votes enst for W. P.
Taylor Instead of W. S. Taylor.
Reports have been received by the Com
mercial (Republican) up to midnight from
11] of the 119 counties, giving the official
count. These give Goebel pluralities of
17,169 and Taylor pluralities of 13,4:45; Goe
bel's net plurality 3734. The eight unre
ported counties are: Rowan, Jefferson,
Knox an<! Harrison, in which the can
vassing boards have adjourned until Mon
day, and Johnson, Menofee, Cumberland
: and Letcher. which have not yet sent in
â  their official counts. These eight coun
ties, according to the unofficial figures
heretofore received by th>> Commercial,
give Taylor pluralities of 6666 and Goebel
pluralities or K'32; Taylor's net plurality
5624 Deducting from this Goebel's plu
rality, 3711 in 111 counties, loaves Taylor
a plurality in the whole State of ISW.
The Democratic unofficial returns from
the eight unreported counties show a net
Taylor plurality of 4052. Using those fig
ures with the Commercial's official plu
rality of 373! from 111 counties, it still
leaves Taylor a plurality of 1218.
BRYAN ON THE ELECTION.
Democratic Leader's Summing Up of
the Results.
LINCOLN, Neb., Nov. ILâ W. J. Bryin
this evening gave to the press an ex
tended statement summing up the results
of the elections in different States.
In Massachusetts and Pennsylvania,
where the Democrats reaffirmed the Chi
cago platform, he finds that they have
made Rains, while in New York and New
Jersey the Republican vote shows a fall
ing off. Maryland, he declares. Is now
safely Democratic. On the Kentucky
election hf pays:
"The result In Kentucky does not give
any encouragement to the Republicans.
The latest returns show that the contest
between Mr. Goebel and Mr. Taylor Is
very close. The Democrats claim the
election of Goebel and the entire State
ticket by small pluralities. The Legisla
ture Is safely Democratic in both bran, li
es, nun the election of Blackburn to suc
ceed Lindsay is assured. No one who has
watcbea the contest will doubt that with
the Democracy united on national issues
Kentucky canhe relied upon for a major
ity of 20.000 or 30.000."
( >hk> is summed up as follows: "What

DOES THE WORK.
No Surgical Operation, No Pain, Tri-
fling Expense â A Simple, Harm-
less Remedy, but It Does
the Work.
There are some people who have piles
as frequently and regularly as other peo-
: pie have colds.
: Any little bowel trouble will bring them
on, any extra exertion, as in lifting 1 , will
produce them, and in fact will often ap-
pear without any apparent provocation.
Piles, however, are much more serious
j than a cold, as the tendency Is always to
I grow worse until the trouble becomes
deep seated and chronic, or develops into
I some fatal rectal disease.
While there are many pile remedies
i which give relief, yet there Is but one
: which not only gives Instant relief but at
! the same time makes a permanent cure,
I and that Is the well known Pyramid Pile
I Cure.
This remedy is composed of simple,
harmless vegetable ingrodicnts, but com-
binrd co effectively and acts so promptly
and thoroughly that It cures every form
of piles, whether itching, blind, bleeding
or protruding.
In long standing cases the Pyramid Pile
j Cure has proven to be the only certain
cure except a surgical operation, and its
advantages over an operation are many,
\ as it is painless, causes no delay or Inter-
ference with daily occupation, and last
I but not least, it is cheaper than any sur-
gical operation could possibly be.
The cases that the Pyramid Pile Cure
' will not reach are so few that physicians
; are doing away with operations for piles
and depending upon this cheap but effec-
tive remedy to accomplish a complete
| cure, and it never disappoints except in
cases beyond the reach of medical skill.
The Pyramid Pile Cure is prepared by
! the Pyramid Drug Co. of Marshall. Mich!,
and for sale by druggists everywhere at
60 cents per package. Each package con-
tains a treatise on cause and cure of piles
together with testimonials from every
I section of this country.

a signal victory. Their candidate. Judge
Hnlcnmb, carried five of the Congres
sional districts out of the six and lost the
remaining district, the First, by only 1000.
The fusionists made a gain of three Dis
trict Judges and a large gain in county
officers."
Mr. Bryan continues: "Taken as a
whole, the election returns from all the
States give encouragement to those who
hope for the overthrow of the Republican
party in 1900. It is evident that those who
believed In the Chicago platform In 1896
stitll believe in it. It is also evident that
the hostility to the Chicago platform
among those who opposed it is not as
pronounced as it was in 1896. It is ap
parent also that there Is a growing hos
tility to the monopolies which have grown
up under a Republican administration. It
is safe to say that the American people
would, by a large majority, pronounce
against the attempt to raise the standing
army to 100,000, and it is equally certain
that upon a direct vote on the issue a
large majority of the people would pro
nounce against an imperialistic policy
which would develop here a colonial sys
tem after the pattern of Eurogean gov
ernments.
"If the rebuke administered to the Re
publicans at the polls had been more se
vere the prospect of remedial legislation
at the hands of the Republicans would
be brighter. While it was sufficient to
indicate that the people are not satisfied
with the Republican policies, it may not
have been sufficient to stay the course of
the Republican party toward plutocracy
and toward the European idea of a gov
ernment built upon force rather than
upon the consent of the governedâ a gov
ernment relying for its safety upon a
large standing army rather than upon &
citizen soldiery."
CALDWELL ELECTED.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, Nov. 11,â Chairman

All Germany Pleased Over ihÂ« Terms
of the Settlement of the Sa

England.
Coprrirbted, XSH, by the Aisodated Preaa.
BERLIN, Nov. 11.â The long expected
agreement on the Samoan Question and
the visit of the Czar to Emperor William
at Potsdam were two events which
â brought Joy to the hearts of the Ger
mans, for they were both construed as
favorable to the empire and Government
aud the press did everything to assure
the Cxar a hearty welcome. The corre
spondent of the Associated Press learns
from eye-witnesses that the Emperor
and Empress accorded a most cordial
â¢welcome to their gruests, -which was fully
reciprocated. The press dwelt especially
upon the fact that the Czar and Emperor
"William were always exerting themselves
tor peace and that the presence of the
Czar at Potsdam on the Â«ye of Emperor
"William's- departure for England at a
moment when Germany had entered Into
Â» friendly understanding: with Great Bri
tain regarding colonial policy was tanta
mount to an additional guarantee of
peace.
After the Czar's departure the press In
dulged In the wildest guesses as to what
the monarchs might have agreed upon,
especially during the ten minutes' quiet
talk while alone in the mausoleum of Em
peror Frederick, when the doors were
â closed and all others were excluded. Some
papers went to the length of reporting the
exact words of the monarchs during these
ten minutes.
The correspondent of the Associated
Press learns from an excellent source
that after a silent prayer at the tomb of
Emperor Frederick, they as silently shook
hands and left the mausoleum. At din
ner, where Count MuravieiT. Count Bulow
and Prince Hohenlohe were present, an
exchange of ideas on the political situa
tion occurred, but Informally. There -was
r.o compact whatever made.
It should ba remembered that the Em
peror has distrusted France since M.
liourgcnis, in 1k96.l k 96. seized the opportunity
â¢when Great Britain was wroth at the
Kruger telegram to further France's in
terest In tha direction 01" the idea of a
"revanche."
AVhile no specified agreement was en
tered into. Identity of opinion was found
to exist regarding the present and future
policy In China, South Africa, the Bal
kans, Greece and elsewhere. The cor
respondent learns also that the Czar and
Emperor informally conversed during the
course of the day on a number of matters
likely to occupy Germany and Russia in
the i:Â°ar future. Including the renewal or
the commercial treaty. The monarchs
separated sure of one another's pacilic
and friendly intentions.
On the whole the correspondent Is In
formed on good authority thr.t the visit
of the Czar makes for good, lie left with
the conviction that Germany and iiu3sia
may remain pood friends, even If Ger
many is improving her relations with
Great Britain.'
One subject of the conversation of the
monarchs and statesmen accompanying
them, â¢ the correspondent is credibly in
formed, was the phenomenal progress of
the United States as a potent factor ev
exywhere on the globe. This subject is
raid to have caused a lively discussion, as
jthe ideas on the subject by no mean 3 tal- ;
lied- â 
From personal observations the corre
spondent is able to pay that the Czar pre
sents the appearance of a man in fair
â hfalth. Ills motions and speech are rapid
and :unaffected. Of course, precautions
for the safety .of the visitor were of the
most minute and comprehensive descrip
tion. The train conveying the Czar tiav
. ded only twelve' miles an hour and
>topped frequently while a pilot engine
rwp.v â¢ ahead was examining the grade.
[Detectives shadowed every step of the
Czar while at. Potsdam, even when alone
with the German Emperor in a dogcart,
\chlle the later drove through the park of
6a:is Souoi. â¢ '
. ." The newspapers, -with few exceptions,
express lively satisfaction at the Samoan
settlement. There Is no doubt that Count
yon Bulow. has gained tremendously in
favor, hot only with the Emperor, but
with people of almost all shades of opin
ion. He receives the whole credit for the
agreement. Even the hostile Kreuz Zei
tunfc admits he has thereby deserved well
Of the country. The price paid for Samoa
Is not deemed too high. All the papers
except a. few of-, the pan-German variety
express conlldence that the United States,
ha the owner of Tutuila Island, will prove
a peaceful and accommodating neighbor.
In the Joint Samoa settlement the war
in Somh Africa has nearly been lost sight
of. The dispatches from, there have been
but little commented upon.
The Reichstag will meet on November
24, and- it is probable that the session will
be most lively. There are throe very Im
portant measures about which great di
versity of opinion exists. They aro thÂ«
enti-?trike bill, the naval bill and the re
newal of the commercial treaties. The
f.rst Is not likely to paÂ«?s, unless the
Government accepts radical changes. The
naval bill is more than likely to succeed.
Regarding the treaties, everybody, includ
ing the Government. If at pea. all the pre- ,

for its power to purify the blood. It
absolutely eliminates the corrupting ele-

blood-making glands, and so increases
the quantity of pure blood supplied to
the body.

Besides these of special interest to
America is the meat inspection bill, which
will come up for its second reading at an
early day. The shape in which It was
left by the committee is not acceptable
to both Governments.
The correspondent of the Associated
Press learns from a reliable American au
thority here that If the bill, as expected,
passes with the clause amounting to the
prohibition of the importation of American
Bausages and canned meats the United .
States will not be satisfied and will Im
mediately retaliate with prohibitory
measures on German wines. The result
will be a regular tariff war.
Soon after the Reichstag meets an In
terpellation on the foreign policy of the
Government will be discussed. Nearly |
every party represented will express con
fidence in Count yon Bulow's conduct of
affairs.
The correspondent of the Associated
Press learns that Prince Hohenlohe has
not yet made peace with the Emperor
about the publicity given to his Majesty's
naval projects, and it is strongly probable
that he will have to resign, although
there is still a chance that another truce
will be patched up. It seems certain that
Count yon Bulow will be Prince Hohen
lohe's successor. The Emperor Is deeply
impressed with the skillful manner In
which Yon Bulow conducted the Samoan
matter and managed Russia without giv
ing offense either to Great Britain or to the
Czar, yet obtaining substantial benefits
fur Germany.
The naval plans Incorporated In the
naval bill preserve to the Reichstag the
right of annually granting the precise
sums needed.

same paper says that as Ion? ago as
r. while at the Kiel Naval
Academy, formed the plan of making the
German navy adequately offensive.
The Government press daily eulogizes
the naval programme. The feeling on the
' subject was voiced by General Posen. who
sed as the motto for the colonial so
ciety, "A first-class empire and a ftrst
class navy-" The Emperor Is immensely
pli asei] at the accumulating evidences of
liar approval of his pet idea. The
| Secretary of the Navy, Admiral Tirpltz,
I explained the scheme at a special meeting
iof the Prussian Cabinet. He said that
â  after some opposition he had carried his
i object. Anyway, it Is reasonably certain
I that the Bumiesrath will pass the bill In
! time for the first reading to take place in
I the Reichstag before Christmas. In spite
I of this the Agrarians, Socialists and part
: of the Freissinnige and a majority of the
Center party continue to protest through
their orgrans, suggesting that the Reirhs
! tag had become "a club of nodding rnp.n
r.ikins under the endless screw of the
naval plans."
The csnal bill has been reconstructed
for another Introduction into the Diet. It
now involves a total expenditure of 400,
--â¢ marks, instead of 260.000.000 marks,
as heretofore. The new features h

TEN LIVES LOST WITH
THE WILLIAM M. BIRD
Two Almost Famished Survivors
Picked Up Off the North Caro
lina Coast.
PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 11.â News has
been received here that the Philadelphia
schooner William M. Bird, from Charles
ton, S. C, to New London, Conn., was
wrecked In the October hurricane off tne
Frying Pan Shoala, North Carolina, and
THE EMPOitJUM.
ten of the crew. Including Captain Bar
rett, perished. Two survivors, George 'A*.
Loud, the mate, and George Robinson,
Mamon, have been landed at Salisbury,
Mil., by the schooner Samuel T. Beachem,
from Jacksonville, Fla., which vessel
rescued them on the afternoon of Novem
ber 3, twenty-nine miles southwest of the
Frying Pan Lightship.
The survivors had been without food
or water for ninety hours and Buffered
great hardships, having chewed tae
leather of their shoes to keep from starv
ing. They have not recovered sufficiently
to tell just how their comrades perished,
but they state in an Incoherent manner
that the lost men were swept off one by
one from the wreck, as their strength
grew weaker, and were drowned.
CHARLESTON, S. C, Nov. 11.â The
schooner William Bird, which was
wrecked near Frying Pan Shoals, on Oc
tober 30, only two of the crew surviving,
was of seventy-six tons burden and
cleared from this port October 29 with
lumber. She was built at Camden, N. J.

JAPAN CLOSELY
WATCHES THE WAR
Army Officer Will Be
Sent to Africa.
Bpedal Dispatch to The Call.
PORT TOWNSEND, Nov. 11.â Advices
received by the Oriental steamship Saint
Irene, arriving to-day, indicate that the
Japanese Government is taking a great
interest in the South African war. Upon
the recommendation of the general staff
of the Japanese army an officer will be
sent to the scene of hostilities for the pur
pose of gaining a practical knowledge of
the strength and tactics of the British
army. This move on the part of Japan,
according to the Kobe Chronicle, is indis
pensable for the reason that Japan may
be forced to rely upon the assistance of a
British army at a distant date.
The Russian Minister in Seoul has cre
ated considerable stir in the diplomatic
circles of Japan by making a demand to

spective powers in Korea denned and has
made a proposition to this effect to the
Ministers of the various powers through
Germany's representatives. Japan strong
ly opposes the move, and it is claim-.!
in official circles that Russia has evolved
a plan to counteract Japan's influence ir.
Korea.
An official gazette of Japan announces
that the time allowed for the exchange oi
notes issued by the One Hundred and
Twenty-sixth National Bank of Osaka and

in the gardens of the cities.

lest there might be another drought like
nt years has vanished. Thus far the rain
northern and central parts of the State has
passed that of the corresponding period of
last year, and, while the south has not been so for
yet the prospects even there are good.
The plowing season has begun with an activity
1 recalls the abounding energies of boom years.
All reports agree there will be a larger acreage
planted than ever before in the history of the State.
The great grain farms will be worked to the limit
and the most improved and potent machinery' will be
employed to speed the task. There will be new
orchards and new vineyards set out, and the cultiva
tion cf olives and of nuts will be undertaken on a
more comprehensive scale than ever. It is to be a
year of. progress for rural industry, and every sec
tion of our diversified State from mountain sides to
valleys will exhibit evidences of the beauty and the
thrift that are. to follow industry.
It is not in a material sense only that the rains
have brought us blessings. They have revived the
bloom and the verdure of the landscape and infused
a beauty into every rural vista that cannot fail to have
its effect upon the minds of the people. The tourist
â who comes to California now from out the threaten
ing skies of the East, where morning frosts and chill
Mn<=ts forebode the coming of blizzards and dreary
drifts of snow, will find himself as he descends the
western slopes of our mountains entering something
like an enchanted land. From the purple glow upon
the mountains to the emerald green of the grass
covered hiils and valleys there will be before his
eyes as rich a combination of gorgeous colors 3?

pir with their white splendor and geraniums climbing
almost to the eaves of the cottages and brilliant with
scarlet flnwers.

THE SHIP-BUILDING SYNDICATE.
ONE of tlie most gigantic combinations of this
day of giant enterprises is that which has now
been organized to take control of the great
ship-building yards of the country. The story of the
deal, which was published exclusively in The Call
yesterday, was the most important news item of the
day, and is of interest to every portion of the United
States.
It is not to be denied that the passing of so great
an industry as that of the Union Iron Works from the
control of local capitalists to that of a syndicate hav
ing its headquarters and its chief irterens on the
other side of the continent is to a certain extent
menacing to our welfare. So long as there is suffi
cient work to employ all the shipyards at its com
mand the syndicate will of course maintain the Union
Iron Works up to the present measure of capacity
and will keep it running. Whenever it becomes ad
visable, however, to shut down any of the works it
is almost a certainty that the yard in this city is the
one which will be closed. There are many reasons
why it should be so, for ship-building material is
cheaper in the East than on this coast, and the con
trolling capitalists of the syndicate, being Eastern
men, will be naturally inclined to favor >their own
section. Thus there is a possibility that an establish
ment which has become the pride of the coast, and
which has constructed such masterpieces in naval
craft as the Oregon, will dwindle in importance and
become eventually hardly more than a repair shop.
Fortunately there is no immediate danger of any
diminution in the activity of the Union Iron Works.
Enough work is now on hand to keep a large num
ber of men employed for a long time. There is now
i:i process of construction there two first-class battle
ships, the Wisconsin and the Ohio; three torpedo
boat destroyers, the Paul Jones, the Ferry and the
Treble; and the monitor Wyoming. Some of these
ships are quite well advanced, but, none the icss. a
sreat deal remains to be done when all are taken into
consideration. It is well known that in addition to
the construction of vessels for the navy the Union
Iron Works has much work on hand for private par
ties. It is therefore safe to say that for at least two
.t'.'.rs or more the syndicate will find it necessary to
run the works at their present capacity, and perhaps
before that time cl< >es there may be such an expan
.merican commerce on the Pacific as to keep
tiie works in continuous operation.
An intei ture of the condition in the ship
building rradc brought about by the organization of
the syndicate and the combination of all the ship
yards of the country under one control is the effect
it will have upon the price.- the Government will have
to pay : v the construction of naval vessels. There
nger any competition. The Government
must pay whatever the syndicate demands or it must
go abroad for ships or extend the operation of the
national navy-yards so that it can construct its own
shi;>~ From whatever point of view the subject be
considered it is clear this combination is one of the
most potent that has yet been formed, and the result
of it will be watched with close attention both it
home and abroad.
There is more than one way of snatching victory
from defeat and more than one method ol con
struing out of failure a success. The Washington
authorities have decided that it i e not necessary to
capture Aeuinaldo in order to crush rebellion in the
Philippines. It would be easy to guess what Uncle
Sam's soldiers would do if they found a chance Â»o
grab the island rebel.
Imperialism, expansion, paternali = m and high
sounding platitudes on the brotherhood of man are
leading Uncle Sam into dangerous places. A com
bination of enterprising American bankers want him

CONGRESS AND FINANCE.
THE position of Senator Allison in the bod}* of
which he has so long been a leader gives weight
to any expression he may choose to make on
public issues.
1 1 is townsman, General Henderson, who is to be
Speaker of the next House, by reason thereof not
only but because of his long sustained leadership 01
the Republican side of the House on the floor, is not
listened to lightly when he speaks of public affairs.
President McKinley on his campaign tour con
cerned himself almost entirely with the issue of ex
pansion and imperial domination of races not fit to
govern themselves. He seems satisfied that we can
succeed in taking by force territory that carries with
it an indignant and hostile population, and, with an
optimism that is most admirable, sees those popula
tions in the future becoming more American than
Americans themselves. His inattention to the burn
ing issue of 1896, sound money, would cause some
uneasiness and apprehension were it not for the ut
, terances of Allison and Henderson, leaders respec
tively of the Senate and House.
General Henderson during the lowa campaign de
clared in plain terms for financial reforms, on the line
of the platform of 1896, as expounded by the Indian
apolis monetary conference. He indicated with much
directness <>f speech that if other matters before Con
gress had to wait on financial legislation they must
wait.
While he did not give in detail the financial pro
gramme which, in the Speaker's chair, he will have
the power t.> put through, he plainly indicated his
purpose to go to the extreme of the committee con
ference of last summer and beyond that extreme. He
seems to understand that it is hard to be too radical
to suit the patient and long waiting sound money
sentiment of the country. This speech of General
Ilender-on was delivered at Waterloo, in Black
Hawk County, the home of ex-Governor Horace
H(iie>, wliu^c financial vagaries have made him cele
brated even beyond the fame he acquired by being
the only Democrat elected Governor of lowa since
Stephen Ileamstead's election in 1851.
Senntor Allison's financial speech was made at
Cedar Rapids, one of the centers of sound money
sentiment in the State. Both Allison and Hender
son seemed to feel that something was demanded to
satisfy the country and fill the gap left by the Presir
dent's inattention to the subject. That they performed
an essential service for their party and their country
by the certainty and clearness of their utterances is
felt by all Republicans who believe that it is good
party policy to redeem old promises before making
new ones.
The sound money sentiment of the country should
prepare to make itself felt in support of these two
champions of its cause immediately upon the assem
bling of Congress. The committees of both houses
are to be re-formed, and the membership of the
House Committee on Banking and Currency and of
the Senate Committee on Finance becomes of in
stant importance. The energetic but impracticable
Mr. Walker of Massachusetts is no longer in the
j House to be a stumbling-block head of the Banking
Currency Committee, and in the Senate the sil

ver members are outnumbered beyond the possi
bility of obstructing legislation. The situation leads
the country to entertain .great expectations, and it
should not be disappointed.
The application of civil service rules to the admin
istration of municipal affairs has overwhelmed many
a hard-visaged, beetle-browed political heeler with
consternation. The violent change from the manipu
lation of ward wires to an intelligent understanding
of "the three r's" has wrapped "the push" in almost
unspeakable woe.
THE WORLD'S GOLD SUPPLY.
TZZJYER since the outbreak of the war in South
Africa there have been dismal predictions of
j â * the effects it would have upon the finances and
commerce of the world by reason of the interruption
it would cause in the working of the gold mines ot
the Transvaal. It was estimated that upward of
$100,000,000 of gold would be obtained from that re
gion during the current year, but it is now fairly cer
tain the war will be so prolonged that no gold can
! be expected from the Transvaal for at least a year to
come. The argument of the pessimists has been that
so large a diminution in the annual output of gold
will be felt throughout the civilized world and that
the consequences are likely to be serious.
By way of meeting these predictions and showing
the insubstantial base upon which they rest the
Treasury Bureau of Statistics has recently issued a
statement of the gold production of the world since
Ihe discovery of America, so tabulated as to exhibit
the rapid increase in production which has taken
place in recent years. From these appears the
fact that of the $9,833,059,600 gold produced since
U'M. $5,341,855,600, or considerably more than one
half, has been produced since iB6O, and $2. 540. 260400,
or more than one-fourth, since 1885.
The following condensed table shows the average
annual gold product from 1493 to iB6O, and by decades
from IS6O to the close of 1899, adopting for the cur
rent year an estimate recently made by the Director
of the Mint, but deducting from it the temporary
loS: likely to result from the suspension of production
in the Transvaal during the closing quarter of the
year. The original estimate of the Director of the
Mint for the year 1899 was $350,000,000, and deducting
for tbe suspension of work in the Trans
vaal during the closing quarter of the year, would put
the rSoo production at $325,000,000. The statement of
the world's gold production for the period 1493-1895,
therefore, stands as follows:
Average Annual
Production.
: 193-1600 $4,644,815
1 31-1700 Hi""." 150
1701-1800

! â  ide 1881-1890 10fi.005.560
1691-1899 204,773,555
Another table is given showing the annual output
â  fold from the Transvaal since 1885 in comparison
with that of the world. From that table it appears
the gold output of the world excluding the Transvaal
is now double that of the world including the Trans
vaal a decade ago. It i* not worth while quoting the
entire table, but since 1805 the record stands:
Other parts of
Transvaal, the world.

LS37 &5.f159.561 181.844 9
LS9D 79.213,953 i 1,647
Tt will be seen from these tables that the world is
in no danger of a gold famine even should the Trans
vaal mines be closed for a year, or two years, for that
matter. The gold districts of the rest of the world
are furnishing far more than the average annual out
put of past years, and will therefore be quite able to
supply the demand for that metal. It is to be noted,
moreover, that the closing of gold mining in South
Africa will increase the activity of the industry else-
where, and thus increase the production.
Hypnotism seems to be becoming a popular ex
planation for marital infelicities and delinquencies.
Another Oakland woman, who wanted to run off
with the other fellow, has discovered that she was
"hypnotized."
ONE of the things for which Philadelphia de
serves credit is that of having made a success
of the experiment which Pingree tried in Dt
trcit when he started his potato patches on the vacant
lots of the city. For three years the Philadelphia
Vacant Lots Cultivation Association has been in
operation, and the results have been better with each
succeeding year.
The beginning was made on 3 small scale and the
work of the first year was regarded as hardly more
than an experiment, but the persons to whom the
lots were assigned took hold of their cultivation in
earnest and produced crops which led the association
to widely extend its operation in the following sea
son. The aim is to obtain unused lots in or
near the city for the free use of the poor for raising
vegetables. Seeds and implements arc supplied by
the association without cost, and the only condition
imposed is that the lots shall be properly cultivated
and cared for.
The results of the work during the past season
were exceptionally good. Commenting on them the
Philadelphia Public Ledger says: "Two hundred
and sixty-eight families were given plots of a quar
ter of an acre each, and how faithfully and success
fully the work was performed is shown by the results,
which are between 3000 and 4000 bushels of potatoes,
10,000 to 12,000 baskets of tomatoes, 60,000 to 70,000
heads of cabbage, 10.000 to 12,000 ears of corn, 10,000
to 12,000 stalks of celery, 4000 to 5000 bushels of tur
nips, besides large quantities of other vegetables, in
cluding egg plants, carrots, cantaloupes, watermelons,
beet";, peppers, onions and radishes."
It is to be noted the Philadelphia movement differs
from that started by Pingrce in Detroit inasmuch as
it hns never been under the direction of politicians.
Whether it would have been so profitable had it been
undertaken by the municipal government is doubtful.
As a means of encouraging the poor to help them
selves it is, however, one of the best yet devised,
and the Philadelphia society has good reason to be
proud of its work.
The Governor has positively declined to tell politi
cians or newspaper interviewers whether or not he
intends to call an extra session. This is another
very clear indication that the Man from Mexico has
not yet dropped a nickel in the slot.
London newspapers incline to the belief that Great
Britain has been squeezed out of Samoa. It wouid
be a perfectly safe prediction that our clever cousin
squeezed everything else out of the islands before she
herself left.
People firm in the belief that marriages are made
in heaven will be pained to learn that a couple of
Angells were divorced in this city recently.
Ladysmith is a very appropriate name for a town
besieged by so many gallant men and defended by
so many others.

New Colonel for the Sixth Infantry.
Change in the Matter of
Naval Militia
Drill.
The men in the National Guard are
marreling at the action of the uniform
bourd, consisting of Major General Dick
inson, Colonel Cutler and Lieutenant
Colonel Geistlng, in the recent awarding
of contracts for blouses. At the meeting
held on the 25th of October the bids pre
sented were as follows:
Brown Bros., J4 30 each for blouses and JS 95
for osercouts.
I'ettibonc & Co., $3 54 for blouses, ?S 69 for
overcoats.
.1. M. I,itchfleld, J3 74 for blouÂ»es, $9 io for
overcoats.
Manriol, Purse h & Wiener, 13 S2V4 for blouses
and H 24 for overcoats.
At a subsequent meeting of t.ie board
the contract for the blouses was by voto
of Colonel Cutler and Lieutenant Colonel
Geistinf, General Dickinson voting in the
negative, awarded to two of the bidders,
one-halt' of the 4000 blouses to be fur
nished by the Pettibone Bros. Manufac
turing Company of Cincinnati, Ohio, at
$3 ji per blouse" and the other half to be
furnished by Mandel, Pursch & Wiener of
this city at"s3 92% per blouse.
The Guardsmen are of the opinion that
each nr;n must have furnished sam|iÂ«
that came up to the Specifications
griven assurance and bonds that the goods
to be delivered would be up to the stand
ard required, cisc the two linns named
would not have been awarded the e<>n
tract; but they want to know why the
majority "f the board should vote to pay
3!5Vi centa more to one linn than to the
other for presumably exactly the same
kind of garment. They want to know
why the fund set apart for uniforms
should be diawn upon to the extent of
to procure from the second named
flrm exactly what the tirst named tirm
will furnish for that much less moi.*-}'. j
The reason that Colonel Geis^.nsj. lias
given for i:ls action is that he wants to
patronize home Industry. The Guards
men think that this is a very peculiar
state of affairs. There Is a possibility
that the ettention of the Governor will
be called to it and that there may be
some delay in furnishing uniforms to the
Guard. The contracts call for the deliv
ery of trousers, blouses, overcoats and
caps sixty days after the order is given,
and the orders have b^en given for all
but the blouses. If there is any unusual
delay in regard to them the men will, for
an additional period, be without uniforms,
lor without blouses the trousers, over
coats and caps will not uniform them.
It seems as if it is not the duty of any
one to care for the property of the State.
In liis inspection report two years ago
Major Jnnsen, Inspector of the Second
Brigade, drew the attention of the then
adjutant general to the fact that a certain
amount "f property that had been in
trusted to Troop A, Including twenty -two
pistbls was missing. The value of that
property was considerable. The pistols
b new, we.re worth about $300.
Time passed and no action was taiken in
regard to this loss of property. Last June.
in his report of inspections, the major
again called attention to missing- property
of ihe State lit Troop A and specified it as
follows: "One carbine, 21 pistols (one hav
ing turned up since th^ previous report),
r> cartridge boxes. IS pistol holders, 2 sad
dles 2 bridles, * meat cans, 43 saber belts,
26 saddle blankets, T saber slings and 6
canteen straps." In his report he sug
gested that the matter be Inquired Into
and that it be ascertained who was or Is
responsible for the loss of this property.
He also stated that Captain Burnett, com
manding tin- troop, hud informed him that
the pistols were lost while the late Cap
tain Jenks was In command. The major
added: "Captain Burnett was senior lleu
tenant at that time and he ought to know
what became of the pistols and the other
property." 1 This report was presented
last June, and up to this time no action
lias been taki n In regard to the lost prop
erty. It is true that Captain Jenks is
flead, but if the matter had beeen acted
upon during his lifetime he or his bonds
men would have had to make the loss
good to the State. V rom the apparent in
difference of the previous adjutant gen
eral ami the present one to the loss of
State property it is fair to infer that
neither read the report of the inspector
of the Second Brigade or else neither
car> il or cares what becomes of the prop
erty of the State even if its value runs
up Into the hundreds. Possibly it's a case
of "the Sta*e is rich and the commander
in chief or hi? factotum don't care."

Wife, Who Was a Daughter
of Spain.
Ladygmtth, which lias been brought Into
puch prominence since the outbreak of
the Boer war, wns named after the wife
of General Sir Harry Smith. Tils mar
riage was a rotnance of the Napoleonic
wars. When the British under Sir Arthur
Wellesley. afterward Duke of Wellington,
wore driving the French out of Spain
Henry Smith was a captain in the British
army. One night he and another young
officer in a Spanish town which the' Brit
ish had just occupied were visited by two
beautiful Spanish girls of high rank, who
begged thflr protection In the alarming
circumstances In which they were placed
The protection was. of course, given, and
Captain Smith fell desperately In love
with one. of the girls and subsequently
married her.
Afterward he became General Sir Harry
and she Lady Smith. Sir Harry was em
ployed In South Africa after it became a
British possession, and his name is per
petuated by the town of Harrysmith, just
across the Orange Free State border from

HOW A NAVAL OFFICER
WAS SPOILED.
THE recent death of Commodore
George H. Perkins, U. 8. N., recall 3
an Interesting episode in his naval
history. He joined the navy in 1861
and was a lieutenant In 1861 when the
rebellion broke out. During the following
four years Perkins rendered gO"d service
and was almost constantly on active sea
duty, having 9 years 8 months' credit Tor
sea service up to January 1, 1866. During
the period up to October 1, IS9I, of 25
year? 10 months his total service footed
up only 5 years 8 months, his shore nor
vlce 6 years 9 months and unemployed 13
years 4 months. Promotion, however,
wont on Just the same, and he became a
captain In March, 1882, and retired alter
9 years' service in that grade with a sea
service of 11 months during that period.
It was not that Perkins was incapacitat
ed to perform his share of duty, but Â«im
ply because his private affairs required
so much attention. Jin managed to shirk
fluty for a long time until Secretary
Chandler brought him to time, in May
ISS4, Secretary Chandler ordered him to
t.-ikr command of the Hartford on the
Pacific station. As This older was not
to the captain's liking he called upon the
Secretary With a view of having the or
der revoked.
"See here, old man," said Perkins
"can't I get a change of orders? I am
willing to go to sea or perform any duty
that is necessary, hut it would be a great
hardship nn me to go to the Pacific Coast
just at this particular time. Three ships
on the Atlantic seaboard are to have now
captains and 1 ask as a particular favor
to be assigned to one of them."
"No," leplied Chandler, "you must go."
"Then I'll have to resign from the ser
vice, " said Perkins.
"You -vlll do nothing of the kind "
roared Chandler, "for I'll court-martial
you if you attempt it."
Perkins started a few days later for the
Pacific Coast, Joined the Hartford and
after serving eleven months returned to
his domicile in Boston. Chandler having
given place to Whitney, who had more
consideration for captain Perkins 1 pri
vate affairs. Tho latter received his un
divided .utentton during the following
five years and a half, w*en he was
shocked by an order to loin the Omaha In
the Asiatic station, lie managed again to
obtain leave of absence with privilege to
retire upon completion of fort-- years'
service. October l. 1881, he was placed
on the retired list of captains
Five years later Senator Hale had a Mil
passed promoting Captain Perkins to
commodore.
The cause which led to these years of
duty-shirking was that his wife was \>rv
wealthy and their little daughter had In
herited a fortune of 17.000 I 'oo from a
grandfather Incidentally there was some
litigation about the Inheritance. This
great wealth naturally made him a so
ciety star and under the circumstances
he was much occupied. The service was
forgotten or ignored so far as its duties
and responsibilities were concerned; he
remained on the active list apparently
only for the honor it reflected and await
ed "his promotion to commodore before
retiring.
ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
GOVERNMENT BONDSâ A. O. S.,
Nlles, Cal.- The amount of bonds Issued
under the McKlnley administration was
1200,000.000. A circular offering these bonds
was issued by Lyman J. Gage, Secretary
of the Treasury, June 13, I*9B, and in a
very short time all were subscribed for.
Tff; no ATSâ A. S., Santa Rosa, Cal. If
you desire a position with the tugboat
company named send an application to
the office of the company, giving name,
ape, residence and such details as would
enable the company to determine if you
would be a suitable person to enter Its
service.
ETIQUETTEâ A. F. S.. City. If you
will call at the Free Public Library, City
Hall, reference room, you can there con
suit "Hill's Book of Forms," "The Ency
clopaedia of Business and Social Forms"
and a number of books on etiquette
which will Rive you such information as
you may desire on the subject of business
forms and etiquette.
AT HOME CARDSâ A. L., City. If a
newly married couple have Eent you an
"at home" card upon their return from
their wedding trip etiquette demands that
you should pay a call, but if for any
reason it is impossible for you to call
send a letter of regret and at the same
time extend congratulations as you would
iif you called in person. Your personal
card would not be sufficient.
RAIN GAUGEâ P.. Jamestown, Cal.
There are different kinds of rain gauges
and many of these are called '"standard."
Instructions for using accompany each
gauge. Without knowing the name of tne
one you have, it would be impossible to
tell you how to read it. "An inch of
rain" means if thpre was a perfect level
enclosed space and no absorption there
would be in that Epace water to the
height of one Inch.
IN MEXICO-C. M.. Oakland. Cal. It
Is a remarkable fact that not a gazet
teer, book of reference or guide book
gives the territorial area of the City of
Mexico. One book says that the city is
square, about three miles each way; that
would make the area nine square miles.
San Francisco includes within Its terri
torial limits the county as well and
Its area is given as forty-one and three
quarters square miles. A gentleman who
but recently returned from Mexico says
that that city is about as large as what
is generally alluded to as the city of San
Francisco.
In Mexico, the capital of the republic
of that name, business life, living and
other conditions are not the same as it
is in the large cities of the United States,
but like the conditions in Guatemala and
other large Central and South American
cities.
An American workingman who went to
the City of Mexico in search of employ
ment would find great difficulty in ob
taining such if unable to speak the Span
ish language. He might find work with
some American firm, but he would have
to take his chances.
The population of the City of Mexico
is about 400,000. The next largest city In
the republic is the City of Puebla, which
has a population of 95,000.
HELEN CAMPBELL-S. A. J.. Spreck
els, Cal. Helen C. Campbell, author and
editress, was born in Lockport, N. T.,
July 4, 1839. Her ancestry is Scotch on
both sides. Her father, who was a promi
nent lawyer of New York City, died in
1890. She married at the age of 20 to an
army surgeon named Weeks, and with
him lived in various parts of the United
States. At the age of 23 years, under her
married name, she began writing for
juvenile publications, "Riverside" anf
"Our Touag Folks." After that she wrotÂ»
a number of novels which attracted at
tention, then devoted her talents to works
on housework and cooking. Then she
wrote "Problems of the Poor" and other
works which dealt with the poorer classes
and attracted the attention of the New
York Tribune, which appointed her its
commissioner on the condition of the
women wage-workers of New York, and
the result of her investigations were pub
lished under the title of "The Prisoners of
Poverty." She extended that work to
London, Paris, through Italy and Ger
many, and what she wrote had much to
do with drawing attention to the con
dition of the wage earners of the
countries she visited. She has written a
large number of useful books. In lSfn
she received a prize from the American
Economical Association f<->r a mono
graph on "Women Wage Earners."

Fpeclkl Dispatch to The ChII.
Washington, Nov. 11.â George Rice
Of Marietta, Ohio, who described him- I
eelf as- a "moderate producer of oil." was j
beforo the Industrial Commission .to-day. j
Mr. Rice had prepared in advance a state- j
ment of his views, which he had copy- ,
righted. The pamphlet the com mi j
refused to receive as such, but Mr. Kice !
was allowed to proceed under the rules j
of the commission, using the. pamphlet j
as the basis of his statement.
In hla formal statement fore the con
mission,' Mr. Hice accused the railroad
companies generally of conspiring In con- (
nection with the Standard Oil Company
to drive independent reiineries out of the ;
field of activity. He gave alleged in- 'â 
stances of discrimination by the railroads :
In favor of the Stanard Oil Company, pro- ;
\ious to the passage of the interstate â 
commerce law. lie asserted that in onÂ» j
case, many years ago, a discrimination ot ,
160 per cent had been made for the Stand- i
tird Company, and added that rates on I
his products from Marietta were advanc
ed in IS>5 to the extent of from 48 to lw
per cent; whereas, ho paid, no advance
Mas made In tho rates of th â¢ Standard
Company.
Replying to the statement of John D.
Archibald of the Standard Oil Company |
that his'- company had made no dlscrlml- :
natory freight rates since tho interstate
commerce law went Into effect, Mr. Rice |
gave numerous Instances of what he
characterized as discrlmlnatlona made in i
the interest of the Standard Company |
since that date. He made charges of j
cuch favoritism against the Southfrn la- ;
clfic, the Union I'aciilc, the Missouri I'a- i
cl:lc and other railroads, saying that the :
charges had been proved by him before I
the; -Interstate Commerce Commission.!
Mr. Rlcp said he had become satisfied
of the efficiency of the Interstate Com
merce Commission and had instituted no
proceedings before it since I*S?.
Mr. Rice said h" had not a particle of
confidence in the truth of the letters from
numerous railroad managers, saying ;
ther^ was no discrimination in favor of
the Standard Company, which were read
to the commission by Mr. Archibald.
Speaking of his personal experience. Mr.
Kice said that his refinery at Marietta !
had ;been closed for the past three years j
ns a 'result of these discriminations.
"I: have," he said, "been driven from
pillar to post, from one railway line to
nnoth.e.r. lor twenty years in the abso- |
lutc-ly. vain endeavor to jr't eaual and just |
freight rates with the Standard oil trust, |
fo as to- be able to run my refinery at j
anything approaching a profit, but this I I
have been utterly unable to do."
lie assorted that the Standard Company
was .represented in the directorship of !
railroads controlling one-fifth of the rail- i
road mileage of the country. Mr. Rice
stated 'his conclusion to be that "our Gov
ernment is a failure, because of non-en- !
forcement of our laws against this plrat- i
leal crew who infest our inland com
xr.f-ree under the secret cover of unlawful i
rebates and combinations and thus rob
the people of hundreds of millions of dol- ]
lars."
He. thought the laws sufficient for the â 
protection of the people, but the difficulty j
was found in the failure of the officials '
to enforce the law. The responsibility, he !
eald. lay with the Attorney General." He i
thought the. Government should own the I
railroads, and that the protective tariff
ehouM be removed from the articles used
by the" trusts. In case of Government I
ownership, he would have the railroad
employes disfranchised in order to take !
the roads out of politics. I > thought that ; '
The money recently spent in conducting |
a "useless foreign war" could have been 1
much mor<? profitably used in the pur- i
chase cf the railroads.

GREYHOUNDS
COURSE IN
THE STORM
Over Two Hundred Dogs in
the Running at Three
Parks.
: The sport at Union Coursing Park yes-
I terday Â«as but little more than a curtain
i raiser for the : â ;:-â¢ programme arranged
j for to-day. The run-down of the reserve
; stake was disposed of, and provided an
: interesting afternoon of coursing, not
! withstanding the depressing condition of
I the weather. The hares did not run as
! they iliil when the Held was dry and they
i fed -on grain and other solid foods.
The biases t upset of the day was the
â  defeat of J. Hurley's good dog 0 X Cap
: Itoi by Maher & Reid's Uncle Fuller. The
i two dogs first ran an "undecided" extend
; ins over 1 minute 26 seconds. The second
: hare to which they were slipped was not
i a strong one. Uncle Fuller led up and
' killed, .shutting out 0 X Capitol pointless,
'' after fourteen seconds' running. Beer
' Brewer beat The Fram at odds of 1 to 2;
Hair Brain beat Imperial and Maid of the
â  1-1 111 beat Glen Roy at the same odds.
The tid-bit of the programme to-day is
I the match between the Pasha Kennels'
I Recording Angel and D. J. Henley's Sis
quoc, best two out of three courses. There
is a delightful difference of opinion among
coursing men as to the relative ability
of the two youngsters, which means
1 heavy wagering on the outcome of the
: contest. L'iV. ,
The complimentary stake has eight high
; class dogs running. In the long odds book
' they were held yesterday as follows:
' Luxon 3 to 2, Brutus 3 to 1, Crawford Lad
4 to 1, Emm Pasha and Master Clair C to'

SAN RAFAEL. Nov. Wesson
Wandr, a prisoner in the County Jail
serving thirty days for petit larceny
committed in Bausallto, made his third
attempt to escape from custody to-day.
â \Vandy came near being scalded to
death and created such a scene that for
a brief period the excitement was as In
tense as during the trouble caused a few
days ago by Mary Cuneo and Michae.
Murello. Several days ago Wandy tried
to elude the vigilance of Deputy Sheriff
Lucas and yesterday made an attempt to
fool Sheriff Taylor and regain his free-
< This evening he pulled down the Â§ steam
pipe passing through the "ghost cell,
presumably with the Intention of using
a pifoo of it as a bludgeon to knock the
jailkeeper senseless and make another at
u-mpt to escape. Instantly the hot team
tilled the cell and the prisoner was se
vorelv scalded before lie could retreat to
a corner and throw himself on the floor.
His screams of terror and pain set the
three tramps in an adjoining apartment
to yf-lling and beating their cells and the
jailkeeper ran to the prison door to see
what was the trouble. In a few minutes
the whole jail was dripping with water
and clouds of steam rose to the upper
floor through the hallway. Wandy was
dragged outside almost unconscious, the
firos wero banked and the escape valve
turned on. Things soon quieted down,
but Wandy had to be wrapped in a wet
sheet and given medical treatment.

bt-ek he boasted that his Imprisonment
had cured him of the cocaine habit. It
appeared that he had actually rallied
from the hold the vice had made on
him, and the fact was commentr-d
upon by the press. It now appears that
his return to the use of cocaine was
coincident with his release from pris
on, and his attempt upon his life was
due to despair over ever overcoming
the habit. Drs. Holmes and Dorr
worked over him most assiduously,
however, and saved his life after a

EARLY IN THE FIELD.
Harry Edwards Announces Himself
Candidate for Mayor of San Jose.
SAN JOSE, Nov. 11.â Next spring's city
election, the first under the new charter,
promises to be an exciting one, for al
ready there is a stir among; prospective
candidates for Mayor. To-day Harry J.
Edwards, manager of the Electric Im
provement Company, announced himself
as a candidate for that office. This was
at the solicitation of a number of citizens.
The early launching of the Edwards
boom is somewhat of a surprise. The elec
tion does not occur until May, and this
gives Edwards' forces nearly six months'
time to prepare for the election. Edwards'
platform is a short one. It Is for a greater
San Jose, economical city government,
and such beautifying and improvement of
the city as to attract, nomeseekera Ills
ami-gang proclivities' will secure him
much support, and as he is very popular
be will make a hard fight. Edwards' com
pany has been the means of cutting the
gas and electric light rate in half and
this will give an impetus to the boom He
also stands on his reputation as Park
Commissioner.

CLARK'S AGENT
UP FOR BRIBERY
The Montana Senatorial
Scandal Reopened.
SUPREME COURT'S HEARING
Legislators Testify That He Sought
to Buy Their Votes for the
Millionaire Mine-
Owner.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ANACONDA, Mont., Nov. 11.-This week
the time of the Supreme Court of Mon
tana haa been taken up with the hearing:
of the charges against John B. Wellcome,
one of W. A. Clark's attorneys, who was
Clark's confidential man during the Sen
atorial election last winter and who iB ac
cused of having distributed at that time
i large sums of money in the alleged bri-
I bery of members of the Legislature in the
interest of Clark. The process pending in
i the Supreme Court is for the disbarment
! of Wellcome.
i Last January in joint session of the Leg
islature $30,000, chiefly in bills of the de- ;
: nomination of $1000, was passed to the pre- ;
I siding officer's desk. The testimony then
l taken was that Wellcome had given this
money to three members of the Senateâ
Whiteeide, ClarÂ«. and Meyers. These
three declared that they took the money
for the purpose of exposing the bribery.
Other members of the Legislature were
Involved in the exposure. The matter j
passed to the Grand Jury, which was \
! asked to find that either there was bri
bery in the Interest of Clark or a con-
I splracy against him. The Grand Jury
i brought in a non-committal report.
Soon after the Legislature adjourned an
action was started in which the Supreme '
Court was asked to hear evidence under ]
disbarment proceedings against Well- I
come. The preliminaries were thoroughly |
argued at several sittings of the Supreme i
Court, counsel for Wellcome strenuously I
denying the court's jurisdiction. Weeks i
passed. At length tne Supreme Court an* |
nounced that it would try the issue and j
j the hearing began last Monday.
Whiteside testified to having had direct
I dealings with Wellcome in several trans
actions involving the purchase of votes.
, State Senator Clark of Madison County
; testified that on appointment he was in |
Wellcome'a room at the Helena Hotel: j
that Whiteside was present: that Well- '<
:' come counted out ten $1000 blils; that these \
were put in an envelope and marked by
; State Senator Clark with his initials In
the presence of Whiteside and Wellcome;
: that Wellcome proposed that the money
thus placed in the envelope and marked
be put In Whtteslde's care, the bargain
being that State Senator Clark was to
t vote for W. A. Clark as long as Well
come should request him to do it.
Senator Meyers of Ravalll County testi
. fled that the $10,000 in the envelope mark- j
; ed with liis initials, which was also de
, posited with the State Treasurer last win
ter, was given to him as he supposed for
the purchase of his vote for W. A. Clark.
Speaker Stiff of Missoula County testi
fied that from one of Clark's agents he
was urged to accept $10,000. he to retire
from the Speakership contest and vote for j
Clark for Senator.
The impression is, under the ruling |
made to-day, that the Supreme Court will ;
confine the testimony strictly to the i
| charges that relate directly to the ac- j
1 cured, Wellcome, whose lawyers are mak- !
Ing a sturdy defense. The hearing will l
probably consume the court's time for an- i
other week. The case gets Its especial
Interest from the fact that all persons j
concerned regard it as the preface to the j
proposed action to have W. A. Clark's :
in the Federal Senate declared va-
I cant on the ground of bribery.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C, Nov. 11.â Japanese I
papers received by the steamer Saint
â  Irene from Yokohama contain an inter- ;
, viÂ«w given by Li Hung Chang to an
i American soldier correspondent at Peking. :
â¢ The Japan Advertiser, which obtained
â  the interview from the correspondent, I
1 says:
"Tn discussing the question of the war j
in the Philippine Islands the old Chinese
statesman said the United States should
not now be fighting there. He blamed
the United States severely for having de â¢ J
I serted its traditional policy, and assured '
j an American officer who accompanied the
correspondent that had President Grant
been alive now the country would never
have entered on such a policy as that
which induced the struggle now going or.
. in the Philippines. He prophesied that it [
! would be disastrous to the United States
j if It continued to enforce such a policy."
When asked If China would object to
the raising of several regiments of Chi
nese mercenaries to fight the Filipinos, he
said China would not object if they were
enlisted In the Philippines and with the
knowledge and consent of the Consul
I there. "In my opinion," said Li Hung
] Chang to the interviewer, "the best thing
the United States can do Is to sell the
Philippine Islands to Japan, who, I have
reason to believe, would readily buy them
for the sum paid to Spain for them.
Then, with the question disposed of bet
ter than it ever will be under the present
! policy, the United States should clear off
home, and, dropping the idea of a Philip
pine Island colony, attend to Its own busi
ness." If this course was not pursued,
the next best way, he thought, was to
buy Aguinaldo out.
The Saint Irene brought the largest
â  cargo ever carried out of a Japanese port.
I She brought 6000 dead weight, or about
\ 10,000 measurement. News was brought
by her that Hongkong raised a corps of
fifty volunteers who were offered to Brit
ain for service in the Transvaal. Manila
also offered a corps. Neither was ac
cepted by the War Office.
A Japanese paper, referring to ihe
Manila corps, says: "It is a well-known
j fact that there are at least 2000 British
I subjects fighting for the United States In !
â  the Philippines." i

CAUGHT IN THE MESHES OF THE LAW
CAPTAIN HENRY KILLED
BY THE CHIEF OFFICER
Murderer Takes Advantage of
a Storm Off the Horn.
Ship Cyrus Wakefield Arrives With but One
Member of the Crew That Was Aboard
When the Tragedy Occurred.
<\7? <" /AB r ' a P ta!n F - T - Henr y of the I
\\.- v/ /V A '"' r '"'â 'â  ship Cyrus Wakefleld I
VoVVi/7 murdered Â°^ ape Horn, or
aXi was he killed by being washed
by a sea off the poop to the \
deck: below
The Wakeneld arrived in port yesterday j
tuid the log shows that "on June 15, about j
I-.ZQ' p. m., shipped a heavy sea on the j
etarboard quarter, which tick Captain j
Henry and knocked him off the after- ;
house down en the dork. He struck I
ngaiilst some iron and received some ter- j
rible injuries to his chest, back and hips, j
nr.d his head was cut to pieces. We car
ried'him' Into the cabin and did every- I
thing In our power to restore conscious
ness, but failed, and Captain Henry died
at Sf2o p. m." Thin entry was made on
the log: by First Mate Williamson.
Thomas Yisiga, the steward of the Cy
prus Wakefield, is the only man left aboard
who knows anything about the tragedy,
and he says Captain Henry was mur
tdered. Furthermore, he says the killing
â¢was done by Mate Williamson with a
hammer,- and that the man at the wheel
and other witnesses of the tragedy were
, till paid off at Port Stanley and are now
'scattered to the four quarters of the
globe.
The Cyrus Wakefield left New York for
Ban Francisco on April 4 last with a gen
eral earj-'tj. Captain F. T. Henry was in
command, and his first and second officers
â wore 11. Williamson and A. Johnson. The
vessel had fair weather to the Horn, and
then in' a succession of pales the vessel
Vegan- to leak and the pumps broke down.
Captain Henry and Mate Williamson had
been quarreling almost from the time the
chip left New York, and on June 15 J when
the captain was killed; the mate decided
to put into Port Stanley; In the Falkland
Islands. There he paid off the five men
who had been on deck when Captain
Henry was killed, and left the ship him
self. The American ship John R. Kelly
had been wrecked in" Port William, near
port Stanley, just before the arrival of
the Cyrus wakefleld so Captain Chap
man took command of her, and finding
her to be very much trained can to
Fan Francisco via the Cape of Good
[op* .
The tale of the killing of Captain Henry
Is thus told by Steward Thomas Visiga:
"The captain and mate were always quar
reling," said be yesterday. "Mate Wil
liamson did not like the old man, and told
him so on numerous occasions. On the
night -of the killing the mate got a ham
mer from the carpenter nt a quarter to 7

wheel when the captain and mate were
quarreling near the wheelhouse. He also
paid off the four men who took refuge in
the rigging just before ihe sea broke
aboard and who had seen everything that
took place. Then he left the ship him
self and Captain Chapman of the John R,
Kelly took command. Captain Honry's
head was terribly battered and I am cer
tain he never got the wounds by being
washed from the after-house to the deck.
I think the mate tried to kill him with
the hammer and finished him with a dose
of !audajium."
The remains of Captain Henry are now
aboard the Cyrus Wakefleid and an au
topsy may show whether the wounds on
the head were accidental or inlllcted
with a hammer.
Captain Chapman, the present com
mander of the Cyrus "Wakefleld, is ac
companied by his wife and daughter and
Mis.-- Lydia F. Keene, who is acting as
governess and companion Tor Miss Chap
man. They all left New York for San
Francisco In the John K. Kelly and had
a delightful voyage until Cape Horn was
reached. There very heavy weather was
mtered and the vessel sprang: a leak.
Captain Chapman decided to run into Port
Stanley for repairs and reached Port Wil
liam in safety on May 24. The next day,
accompanied by Mrs. and Miss Chapman
and Miss Keene, he went ashore at Stan
ley to enter his ship. The party had not
been an hour ashore before a sudden
storm came up and the Kelly parting her
anchors was driven ashore on a reef.
Almost before the watchers on the beach
could express their consternation the
ship's back was broken and the waves
were washing: over her fore and aft. The
men took to the ringing and were flna^y
rescued, but the snip became a total
wreck.
Everything that the captain and his
family owned in the world went down
in the wreck and Just as they were pre
pared to taice passage for Valparaiso the
Cyrus Waketield put Into port with Cap
tain Henry dead. Captain Chapman then
took command and brought the Wakefleld
to San Francisco. lie reported to the
owner? that the ship was strained and
that he would come here via the Cape of
Rope. The voyage from Stanley
vim un< ventful except that a young man
named David Dean fell overboard a week
ago and was drowned. He was a great
favorite with everybody on the ship and
officers and crew have not yet recovered
from the shock caused by his death.
WEDERINTY FINED.

Oregon T. Wedekind was sentenced yes
terday mornjng by United States District
Judge de Haven to pay a fine of $100, or,
in default thereof, to remain in Jail until
the fine shall have been paid. As the sen
tence would be equivalent to life impris
onment in the case of a poor man like
Wedekind, the law has wisely provided
that the Indigent prisoner may be. set free
at the end of thir'y days, the unpaid fine
to stand against him aÂ» a judgment to be
collected by execution should he ever
cmc into poss*3Bion of anything worth
attaching.
Wed' kind's offense was in sending to his
wife through the mails several obscene
letters accusing her of conduct unbecom
ing a lady of high or low degree. She had
separated from him, and his evil genius
induced him to vent his resentment by
means of pen, ink and paper arid a post

Judge iLawlor Grants Her Bequest
and Sentences the Inhuman
Criminal to Ten Years'
Imprisonment.
Miguel Esqueda, the Inhuman murderer
of his wife, Soledad Esqueda, who was
convicted of manslaughter by a lenient
jury in Judge Lawlor'a court, was sent to
San Quentin Prison yosterday for a term
of ten years, the limit allowed by law fur
the offense committed. During the trial
of the convict it developed that he wu a
perverted monster. Without cause hÂ«
locked his wife, then in pour health. In a
room of their dwelling at 1317 Powell

her down with lists and bludgeon, and as
she pleaded for mercy kicked her on the
abdomen until unconsciousness ended her
misery. Some time later she- was found
by other occupants of the huuÃe and car
ried to her deathbed. Restoratives were
administered and she came back to con
sciousness just long enough to make a
statement of the brutal abuse she had
suffered at the hands of her murderer
and then succumbed.
The trial of Esqueda occupied several
days, but the doubt raised as to whether
or not the wretch meant to kill his wife
resulted in n verdict of manslaughter,
which is defined as the unlawful killing
oj" a human being without malice. Es

HIGHBINDERS WIELD THE
HATCHET IN CHINATOWN
Lee Ah Ling the First Victim in
a Heathen Factional War,
Assaulted in a Dark Hallway on Washing
ton Street, but His Assailant
Eludes the Police.
Câ'râ i HE long-impending hlg-hbinder war
broke out in Chinatown last night,
with eerious results. Lee Ah Ling,
|i a member of the Lee family, fell a
I victim of the hatchet-wielding
Chinese in a lodging-house at the corner
jof Rosa alloy and Washington street.
: That he was not literally hacked to pieces
j is due perhaps to the fact that the assault
took place in the front hall of the bulld-
J Ing and close to the street, and it is pre
j sumed that the would-be murderer was
| frightened away before he could finish his
"!y deed.
Ling occupies a cot In the City Reeelv
; ing Hospital, with five severe gashes on
! the forehea.il and scalp, two on the right
1 nrm, another under the eye and two fln
! gers have been chopped from the hand.
> The police did not arrive on the scene
; until a few minutes after the deed was
j done, and have no clew to Its perpe
j trators., As th* victim of the assault is
j a member of the See Yup society, as well
, as certain highbinder organizations, there
! is a suspicion that the attack may have
i grown out of certain bad feeling existing
ovi :â  the festival held by the See STups
! this week and which terminated Friday
morning.
About JO o'clock last night Lee Ah Ling
was either entering or coming out of the
building or, Washington street, where he
has lodgings. He was attacked by some
unknown batchetman at the foot of the
stairway. The blade of the weapon was
presumably aimed for the head at first,
fur a lar.^e gash was found in the China
man's hat, which fell to the floor. The
n^xt five blows were evidently struck
. while the victim was facing his assailant,
after which the former started to retreat
and was struck twice in the arm from
behind, h â  mi:st have arrived
: at this Interval, lor as Ling sank to the
I lioor in a pool of blood at the foot of

i the attack dropped the hatchet and es

J. "W. Arnett of Lassen County was
charged with having assaulted Mrs. Be
linda Arnett with the intent then and
there to murder her. A Jury returneu a
verdict that he had assaulted the woman
with a deadly weapon, whereupon the
court sentenced him to be imprisoned in
the State Prison for two years. Arnett
appealed and the Supreme Court ordered
a new trial, holding that "It is well settled
that under an indictment or Information
for an assault with an intent to commit
murder which does not charge that the
assault was made with a deadly weapon,
the defendant cannot be convicted or an
assault with a deadly weapon" and the
court had no Jurisdiction to sentence for
the latter crime.

A Good Catch Made by the Whaler.
Smart Run of the Ship Columbia,
A Drunkard's Double
Escape.
The revenue cutter Bear and the whal
ing bark Alice Knowles both got home
from the Arctic yesterday. The Bear
stopped at Seattle on the "way down. On
her way down from the Sound she ran
iiuo a heavy southeaster and for two days
was hove tc^ A thunder and lightning
fctbrm 'playetT around the cutter while she
was hove to, and a number of the crew
I got electrical shocks. | The oflicers say
that many .an electric ttofm has been
their portion in other pane of the world,
but this is the first one they ever expe
rienced on the coast of Oalifornia.
â \Yhile the Boar was at Nome the peop'e
v.'.>re Very much exercised over the non
arrival of the steam-r Lauradu. She hud
many passengers and a full eargx) of pro
visions aboard and was lons overdue. The
news of the wreck of the vessel was
known here, but not at the gold fields.
The Bear made an- extended search and
found the wreck on St. Georges Island.
The creWibqd got all the ship's stores; all
the passengers baggage; about fifty tons
cf cargo, 500 sheep axd -several steers
athore. AH the passengers were landed
und Knany of thcmwenvto Nome on the
Cleveland, while . the women cause back
home' on the Cor win.
The story about chains whalers and
firing shots* -after them because they had
Hciuor- aboard is laujrhed at by the officers
â Of the. Bear. They say that a few In
dians were arrested for illicit distilling,
but no whalers' were chased. Quite &
number o-f criminals were; picked up along
the Alaskan coast and transported to
Fitka. -but' the tales d* their crimes were
told long aj?o in The Call. The Bear, in
company with the McCulloch, will go
fro;n hvre to -San Diego and winter there.
Tha Alice Knowles had a successful sea
pnn in "the frozen- north. She brings back
056") pounds of whak-bone. 470 barrels of
sperm oil arid 430 barrels. of whale oil.
There were no casualties during the
cruise. â¢ '
There' will he a number of changes in

morning. At 6:.w a. m. he was brought '.
in from the corner of Bryant and Second

AN TTNTTSTTAL CASE.
.Supreme Court Passes Upon, a Propo-
sition of Toll-Road Pees!
A ca^-e somewhat out of the ordinary
was parsed upon yesterday by tho Su
preme Court. WT. C. Bedell brought ac
tion against J. B. Scott of Placer .County
t : -> coJlect an assigned claim for tolls al
leged' to bo.' due' plaintiff's assignor for
the passage of animal.B and vehicles over
. county highway. The lower court found
the road in â¢â¢-tion to be a free public
highway. The authority to collect tolls
is found tn the statutes' and Supervisors
may authorize such collection whenever
in, their judjrment the eacixsnse necessary
to oj/erato and maintain such a road Is
too great to Justify the county In keeping
it in condition, . .c. :;" . '
â¢ Such a rljrlit .0/ license was granted in
this case' and Si;>it lost in the lower court.
The higher court reversed, the motion for
a new trial upon the ground that the
records of the Supervisors of Plact-r Coun
ty faJled to show that the board had re
ceived evidence and made such determina
tion. In fact the records failed to- show
th-nt the. road was a free public highway
#nd ono so fatally- defective that the
plaintiff cannot collect the toll 3 claimed.

"Chinese dot?s are taught to subsist
upon bolledjrlce with a little milk, and
t become so placid that- thty will not
even bark,' says Dr. Oswald.
This seems to. demonstrate, the fact
that a. largely vegetable diet inclines
to quiet the nervous system, where, on
the contrary, a diet composed largely
of flesh is ultimately irritating, par-
ticularly to one confined mostly to men-
tal work. .:>â ,.->;
Grape-Nuts was placed on the mar-
ket for the v.so of brain workers. It Is
a concentrated nourishing food, con-
taining In its make-up minute particles
of phosphate of potash obtained from
the field grains. This, when combined
as nature combines it in the human
body with albumen, makes the gray
mat of the brain and the nerve cen-
ters : therefore, the use of Grape-Nuts
Fiipplies the brain worker with steady
renewal of the daily losses from his
employment. Grape - Nuts do build
brains, as can be demonstrated by ten
days' or two weeks' use. There comes a
rteady, sturdy feeling of independence

TRUE TALE OF
TWO SYMPHONY
ORGANIZATIONS
Secretary Wheeler Is
Interviewed.
BThere seems to be some misunderstand
ing in regard to the two symphony so
cieties now in existence in San Francisco.
Bo in order to ascertain the true state of
affairs the secretaries of both societies
were asked in regard to this matter, and
the following was the result of the in
quiry: Harold Wheeler, secretary of the
old Symphony Society, stated that at the
end of last season a meeting was called
at which forty of the 900 members mado
their appearance. In fact, Mr, Wheeler
contends that this number is about the
largest ever attending the meeting's and
all of the society who take real interest
in these matters. At that meeting the
board of directors presented their report,
which, not being quite completed, was de
ferred until the next meeting, which, 30
far, has not taken place. There is in the
treasury $1800, which lay idle because the
society has not been able to secure a
leader. Notwithstanding the funds and
the membership of 900 of our best citizens
the board of directors have not made any
efforts to commence the new series sim
ply because, as they thought, there was
no leader to whom they could intrust the
baton. Mr. Wheeler lurther states that
several musicians applied for the position,
but that none was sufficiently known to
authorize the board of directors to en
gage him. The officers of the old society
are now awaiting the result of the con
cert to be given by Henry Holmes at the
Grand opera-house next month, and if
the gentleman proves successful he will
be engaged by them.
Officers â¢â ' the new society claim that
they are an entire separate body from
the old Symphony Society, that they agi
tated this new movement because the old
board of directors did not seem to find
it worth while to begin a new series, and
that according to their opinion Mr.
Holmes is the best man for the position.
The concert at the opera-house has noth
ing to do with the old society and
I In case the board of directors should not
' find Mr. Holmes worthy to be engaged
! after he has proven his success the new
j society will proceed to induce the old sub
j scribers to j>>in the new society. So far.
â  however, there is no desire for antagon
i ism and the new society is perfectly will
i ing to abandon its purpose, provided the
I old board of directors shows visible inter
-1 est in the movement

FROM CABLE TO TROLLEY.
Work to Commence Immediately on
the Reconstruction of Howard
and Post Streets.
The longr-contemp onstructioo
of the Howard and Post street cable lines
iiitn a trolley system is about to ma
terialize at last. By to-morrow morning
a gang of men will be put at work under
the supervision of Chief Foreman T. B.
Egan of the Market street combine to
effect the change on Howard street frum
the ferry to Tenth street. While this
branch of the roau 1b being reconstructed
all cable cars of the Howard street line
will stop at Tenth street, to which the
Ijas.sriigers from the Post and Leaven
worth street lines will be transferred v
usual and carried from Tenth to Potrero
avenue over the present route.
On the completion of this the first sec
tion the cars will then be run from Tenth
street to the ferry and the services of the
Mission street line will be invoked to
carry passengers southwest with the aid
of the Bryant street trolley line. The
passengers patronizing the Howard street

system will be carried to East Mission
along Twenty-sixth street.
Immediately on the finishing of the
Howard street line the work of trans
forming rhe lines on Post and Leaven
worth str?t-ts will be commenced.
Valencia street cable will soon follow
into the rusty pile of castaway wire ca
ble. It is only a question of time, and
brief at that, when cable service through
the Mission will be a thing of the past.
In addition to the changes mentioned
there arc- a few more which will be
hailed with delight by the residents of
th<> Mission road. In future between 5
and S:3O a. m. and from 4 to 7 p. m. cars
will be operated every six minutes to Chi
na avenue. Every other car will run to
Ingleslde, which will give the people of
that section a 12-m!nute schcdulo. r'rom
Twenty-ninth street to the ferry a three
minute service will be maintained. From
8:30 a. m. to 4 p. m. there will be a six
minute service to Twenty-ninth street
and a 12-minute service to China avenue.
Better rervice. both by faster time and
more frequent trips, has been scheduled
for Folsom street. The travel over this
line since the trolley service was extend
ed along: the San Bruno road Justifies a
better service than formerly.
D'ANCONA'S ELIGIBILITY.
Willing to Waive His University
Fees to Be Supervisor.
A etory has gained currency that under
a provision of the new charter there is a
question touching the eligibility of Dr.
A. A. d'Ancona, Supervisor-elect, to serve
in that capaoltv on account of his connec
tion with the State University of Califor
nia.
The provision declares that any person
holding a salaried office under the city
and county, whether by election or ap
pointment, who shall, during his term <if
, hold or retain any other salaried
office under the Government of the United
a or of this State shall be deemed to
have thereby vacated the office held by
him under the city and county.
Dr. d'Ancona, when seen last night by
a (.'all reporter, said that he did not con
i salaried officer of the
"The Legislature appropriates a
certain amount of money to deffiay the
f the University of California,
of which I am a medical examiner," said
the doctor, "and the Regents pay me J2
ich examination I make of students
Ing the university to test their fit
ness to pass for a course of physical cul
ture. The fee is paid to me not as a sal
aried professor but as a practitioner.
"I do not wish t<~> evade- the spirit of the
law, and now that I have been elected
â  -visor it is my ambition to serve the
people in the right way and not in any
manner violate any provision of the char
ter. 1 am willing if necessary to waive
my fees, which 1 do not consider a salary,
in order to avoid technicalities. However,
I will consult my attorney, and if he con
siders It necessary that I should give up
my position at the university In order to
?uallfy as a Supervisor of San Francisco
deem it my duty to the voters who hon
ored me with thHr votes to give them my
undivided services."
Teachers' Back Salaries.
In reply to a communication sent by
F. H. Oiark, chairman of the committee
for collection of teachers' salary claims,
as to when the Stanford collateral inheri
tance tax would be available for the pay
ment of teachers' demands for Novem
ber and December, IS9B, Treasurer Tru
man says in reply:
"I desire to say that thi? office has no
separate fund into which the Inheritance
tax is paid in an identified shap* as school
funds. The money which has been re
ceived from the Stanford estate, when it
reaches this office, will have been inter
mingled with the State property tax, poll
tnx, interest and other funds available
f..r Ftate purposes. It will be Impossible
to ascertain what portion of It is Stan
ford money. Consequently unless the
money from the State comes to this of
fice this iyear in a different form than in
the past we will have no funds from that
source which we can apply to the salaries
of November and December, 1898."

DENIES SCOTT'S ELIGIBILITY
â â¦
A THREE- CORNERED FIGHT IS
THE FIRST BILLED.
Â« â
Rumors Regarding Proposed Attacks
on the New Organic Law and IÂ£s
Civil Service Provisions
Circulated.
Â«
Contests are inevitably born of elec
tions, but the last battle at the polls will
doubtless result in a series of actions
to determine title to various offices of I
greater .merest to the people than any !
i that have occupied the attention of the
| courts for decades past. Among those
that will be filled the most exciting prom
ises to be a three-cornered affair for the
office of Tax Collector. Edward I. Shee- >
nan, the incumbent, from a casual view
of the affair, seems at present to hold
the trump card. Mr. Sheehan has an
nounced to his friends, those closest to
the official ear and confidence, that a
contest between Richard I. Doolan, Dem
ocratic candidate for the office, and Jo
seph H. Scott, the successful Republican
candidate, is at present In course of pre
paration. The ground of contest as an
nounced will be that Mr. Scott was not
an elector of this city and county five
years next preceding his election. Doo
lan's forces claim that they can prove
this allegation and that after proving: the
disqualification of thÂ« elected candidate
the office will be the property of the con
testant. On the other hand. Sheehan
purposes holding the office until the title
thereto has been definitely settled, which
may be many monthsâ that is, unless the
Mayor takes advantage of his prerogative
and fills the office by appointment pend
ing the outcome of the litigation. Scott's
friends, nowever, point to the lact that
heretofore many officials whose right to
the offices they occupied was being con
tested took the oath and assumed the du
ties thereof pending a decision, and are
confident that the first of the new year
will see Scott on the Inside and the con
testants out. 'â¢
If rumor, long-winded and persistent,
and semi-official assertions are to be re
lied upon, litigation to Invalidate various
provisions of the charter, if not the on
tire lntrument, is yet In the embryonic
state. It is claimed by many of the wise
politicians that infest the City Hall that
the United States courts will be appealed
10 in event the Supreme Court of this
State hands down an adverse opinion in
an action which, It is said, will be |
brought Dy officials In office, among them
a few Supervisors, one city official and
two of the so-called county officers, to
hold their jobs.
Just what points will be raised in the
action before the United States courts
are not in the possession of the rumor
circulators, but they say it will be based
on the provisions of the Federal consti
tution guaranteeing the people a republi
can form of government, which they say
are plainly violated by the working of the
new municipal organic law, which throws
them cut of office before their terms as
provided by law at the time of their elec
tion have expired, and this. lnstead of be
ing republican, is nothing short of an
archy.
These rumor circulators also claim that
the Supreme Court of this State did not
finally pass upon the right of the present
officials to retain their offices until the
expiration of the statutory period lor
which they were elected. The Supreme
Court, they say. simply adjudged that the
charter had been legally adopted, and the
Justices refrained from passing upon
points submitted to them as to the legal
title to the offices, that the record might
not be hampered by extraneous matters
not in issue In the case at bar. On the
other hand, however, it is the consensus
of opinion among prominent attorneys
that the action brought by the county
officers to" enjoin the Registrar from put
ting their offices on the ballot finally dis
poses of the matter, and that those elect
ed under the charter will assume the du
ties of office on the first of the year.
Although the contest of officeholders to
retain their positions has failed as yet to
assume a more formidable status than ru
mor, semi-official acknowledgment and
official silence, it is almost certain that
the civil service clauses of the charter
will have to stand the test of the law.
Prominent counsel have informed various
under-offlcials that these provisions are
unconstitutional, beinc in conflict with
section 16 of article XX of the State con
stitution. This section reads: "When the
term of any officer or commissioner is not
provided for In tht* constitution, the term
of such officer or commissioner may be
declared by law: and if not so declared,
such officer or commissioner shall hold
his position as such officer or commission
er during the pleasure of the authority
making the appointment, but in no case
shall such term exceed four years."
As every official, whether State or mu
nicipal, is considered by law to be an of
ficer, It is claimed that as the civil ser
vice provisions lpso facto make certain
offices subject to life tenure or during
Rood behavior, the limit of four years
placed by the constitution is violated, and
hence the provisions must fall.
A test of the validity of the provisions
may be made in various ways, but it â will
most likely be made by some deputy who !
fails to meet the requirements of the com- j
mission and whose demand upon the
treasury is subsequently repudiated, he
having been declared disqualified, but at
the same time allowed to remain in office I
for the purpose of making the test. Man
date â¢ proceeding's will follow and a de
cision on the point secured.
THE SUPPER ROOM.
A New Feature at the Palace Hotel.
The Palace Hotel management will
on November 18 open their new supper
room for the accommodation of those
who desire refreshments during the
evening.
The room to be devoted to this new
I feature has an entrance from the main
| office and another from the grand court.
When completed the luxurious furnish
ings, the artistic finish, together with
the display of tropical palms, will make
it one of the most beautiful rooms in
the hotel. Myriads of incandescent
lights will be employed to show the
color effects and the harmony of the
decorations.
* Each evening between 9:30 and 12
o'clock orchestral concerts will be ren
dered by the best musical talent under
the direction of Mr. C. H. Randall.
Among the distinguished performers
1 who will assist are Signor Pietro Ma
reno, Messrs. Ford and Regensberger.
f The concerts are to be of a high order
and will be greatly appreciated by the
patrons of the supper room.
The tapestry room adjoining is being
refurnished and will be converted into
| a cloak room, where a maid will at
tend to the comfort of the lady pa
trons.
The conservatory will be fitted up as
! a waiting or lounging room, and smok-
I ing will be permitted there as in the
j supper room.
The perfection of the cuisine and ser
vice, combined with the moderate
charges that have given the grill rooms
at the Palace an international reputa
i tion, are to be In evidence in the supper
i room, which in itself is sufficient to
, justify us in making the prediction that
I the new departure will be a success
i from the start.
A BRUTAL HUSBAND.
Thomas Carr, a Laborer, Charged
With Beating His Dying Wife.
Thomas Carr, a laborer living at 13 !
Michigan street, Potrero, has a wife al- j
most dead from consumption. He gets j
drunk and amuses himself by sitting on
the side of her bed and slapping her face.
Thursday night he slapped her so hard
that she was unable to sleep all night.
Ho repeated the performance Friday
morning and she sent word to Lieutenant
Anderson, begging him to arrest her hus
band, as she wanted to be left to die in [
peace.
The lieutenant arrested Carr Friday
night, and as his wife could not be
brought to court to testify against him
a charge of "drunk" was registered op
posite his name. He appeared before
Judge Mogan yesterday and explained
that he only slapped his wife for fun. He
hoped the Judge would not send him to |
Jail. The Judge ordered him into custody
and continued the case till to-morrow.
Mrs. Carr died last evening, and Thomas
Carr was charged with manslaughter.

"there's no fool like an old fool. I feel
that I have been euch a fool in this mat

Mr. Kankin's smile was a flag of truce.
He came to settle the case brought
against him by the internal revenue of
ilc*:rn for failing to pay hla theater license
In Ban Jose for the years 1898 and 1599.
He had treated Deputy Collector Flan
nery with contumely, had affected not to
know him nor his official station and had
rudely requested him to "go to," whither
deponent Bayoth not. McKee had been
held for trial and the revenue officer
was after his scalp with a dull toma
hawk, but the wily tragedian executed a
flank movement-hoisted a flag of trues,
â¢wrote to Deputy Flannery a letter of apol
ogy each as one gentleman on the stage
might with propriety write to another
gentleman oft the stage, and expressed
his willingness to pay his back license

my doubts about that, and I am tired of
the whole affair and am willing to settle
with the Government, penalties, costs and
all, for my sine against it."
Mr. Thomas has sent to Washington Mr.

cepts it Mr. Rankin will pungle, and the

FEDERAL OFFICIALS'

â¢while he was occupying the office was dis
missed yesterday by United States Dis
trict Judge de Haven under the decision

In the Kelly case the Court of Appeals

courts all jurisdiction of suits brought by
United Statf-s officers against the Govern
ment for fees claimed by them, irrespec
tive of the fact whether Buch suits had
been filed bf fore or after the passage of
the act of 1537. The United States Court
of Claims has been adjudged to be the
only tribunal having jurisdiction of such
suits.
The decision is very unfortunate for ex-
Marshal Long, for he cannot go before
the Court of claims, his cause of action,
which was bftrun before the passage or
the act of 1597, being debarred by the
statute of limitations. Genera] John C
Carey, ex-United States District Attor
ney, is In a similar predicament, he hav

ELECTION BILLS PAID
Official Canvass of Votes to Begin
Monday Morning.
The Election Commission cleaned up Its
election accounts yesterday by ordering
paid claims to the amount of $31,000. Of
this amount $24,240 represented the salaries
of election officers. Commissioner Lane
announced that there was but $21,000 left
in the election fund, but said at the same
time that the law gave the commission
the privilege to draw on the general fund
for all it needed.
Commissioner "Wells admitted the law,
but took occasion to remark that there
had been no evident desire on the part
of the commission to economize, and that
it must remember that $20,000 more must
be drawn from the general fund next
month to defray the expense of the bond
elections.
The commission will on Monday morn
ing begin the official canvass of the bal
lots cast at the late election. It is fig
ured that the work will require at least
two weeks.

OUR BIG FIGHTS
ON PACIFIC COAST
FIGHT FOR THE
COAST TRADE IS
ABOUT TO BEGIN
Proceedings to Open
To-Morrow.
EXPLANATION OF SITUATION
â¦
LARGE INTERESTS DEPEND ON
THE ISSUE.
â¢
Attempt to Deprive Seaboard Cities
of the Only American Trade Ter
ritory on the Mainland
They Now Occupy.
The opening session of the Interstate
Commerce Commission to consider the
suit of the St. Louis jobbers a*ainÂ«t tne
transcontinental railroads for the purpose
of compelling the practical abandonment
of carload differentials and the establish
ment of what are known as graded rates
from the Atlantic seaboard as far west
aa St. Louis on Pacific Coast traffic will
be held to-morrow. What the issue means
to San Francisco, and also to all the oth
er seaboard points on the Pacific Coast.
was neatly voiced in the words of a lead-
Ing business man:
"Please remember that the Pacific Coast
is our all. if not all ours; that we can
not retaliate and Invade the vast terri
tory of the Middle West jobbers east of
the Rocky Mountains. We have no terri
tory west of us to compensate for a loss
of territory east, and if deprived of our
geographical rights we will be driven, if
not to the wall, at any rate into the sea.
We do not believe that you will take
from us even the little that we have, giv
ing it to them who have already mu.-h.
These are the concluding words of the
argument made by W. B. Wheeler before
the traffic officials of the Great >,orthern
and Northern Pacific railways at St. Paul
last May. They are equally applicable
now, for the present situation is fairly
described by them.
The extreme importance of the issue to
the Paciiic Coast and the nearness of the
proceedings may make some present ex
planation acceptable. The men who have
gone to St. Louis in defense of the trade
of the coast are: Traffic Manager Love
land, Attorney E. S. Plllsbury. Charles F.
Tay, President Wakefield Baker and Ja
cob Banich of Los Angeles, all represent
ing the Pacific Coast Jobbers' and Manu
facturers' Association. The transconti
nental roads are defendants to the com
plaint. The Interest of the Southern Pa
cific Company is to hay? the suit adverse
ly decided, for the reason that if the rate?
to the Pacific Coast are made lower from
St Louis and Chicago than they are from
the Atlantic seaboard the Sunset route
will be at a disadvantage.
At present what is known as t c "post
age stamp rates" are in vgue by which
New York, Chicago and St. Louis are
equal rivals for the traffic of the Paciiic
Coast. It is argued by the coast Jobbers
that the principle of graded rates on
transcontinental traffic, being once estab
liPhed, will in time, and in a very short
time, '-destroy or neutralize the advan
tages now enjoyed by reason of geo
graphical position. If rates are graied
westbound there must be grades east
bound. That would Imply that any point
east of Ban Francisco, Portland. Tacoma
or Seattle, Los Angeles or San Diego,
would have lower rates than the coast
towns, which now have such rates be
cause they are on the seaboard; also it
would mean that any point ear~t of the
seaboard could have better rates east
bound than the seaboard for products
and for manufactured goods. This is in
line with vhe persistent effort of the Mid
dle WesH, which is trying to kill sea com
petition upon both the Pacific and the
Atlantic coasts.
As to the abolition of the existing dif
ferentials it is held by coast Jobbers that
the Middle West Jobbers entered this ter
ritory under the war tariffs of 1894, '95
and '95, and that now the Westerners are
claiming as a right what was forced
formerly as a measure of expediency.
Marysvilie, Sacramento and Stockton
have an Interest in graded rates because
they are terminals on account of their
water frontage. Probably the hearing,
after the testimony is in for the Middle
West jobbers, will be continued upon the
Parlnc Coast in San Francisco or else
where.
SOLDIER WHO THREW
SHINING GOLD AWAY
EPISODE IN A STREETCAR THAT
MADE A STIR.
The Martial Creosus Hailed From
North Dakota and Was Only
Just Out of Hospital.
A soldier of the North Dakota volun
teers, who has remained behind his regi
ment in San FYanciECO, being: sick In the
hospital at the Presidio, electrified a car
conductor on the California street line
and a carload of passengers night before
last. lie had been drlnkla* and was
hilarious. The car was No. 47 and was
running extra. Just after it turned into
O'Farrell street from Jones on the way
down to the Market street terminus the
North Dakotan rose from his seat in
steadily and delved down in. his trousers
pockei and Drought up * handful <>f shin
ing twenty dollar pieces that he had re-
I upon his discharge Irom the hos
pital.
"Whoopee!" said he, with a chuckle.
The word was accompanied by a sudden
upward motion and the gold pieces soared
toward the roof of the car and then
fell backward in a jingling shower and
rolled upon the perforated covering of the
floor. "Whoopee!" Once more the soldier
man hoped to rid himself of his earthly
dross, hut he had only silver dollars and
small change to send glimmering into the
air.
The car conductor was in the car ajid
picked up all the money that he could
find. There was $100 In gold pieces and a
small sum in silver.
"I don't want the money," yelled the
excited soldier when the coin was handed

Here was an interesting situation, and

Â»
California Practically Outside of Con
ditions Upon Which Government
Aid Is Predicated in Consider
ing Arid Land Question.
Irrigation history will bo made for Cali
fornia at the convention to be held this
week in this city. Letters received yes
terday indicate clearly that the advocates
of the national idea, as opposed to the
State plan for the impounding of flood
waters of the State, have been working
In many localities to develop strong oppo
sition on the floor of the convention.
George H. Maxwell, who is looked upon
aa the chief advocate In California of the
idea that the National Government will
provide the means for the necessary
storage reservoirs, will be present as a
delegate from Sonoma County, he having
been named by the Sonoma County Su
pervisors. He will strongly oppose the
State plan. Delegates from some south
ern counties, especially 1-oa Angeles, will
coma with instruction* pledging them to
oppose the work of the California State
Association for thÂ« storage of Hood waters.
Agents of certain ditch companies are in
opposition also. The advocatt-s of having
the State provide the way for the con
struction of dams are numerically strong
and Influential.
Elwood Mead, irrigation expert for the
United States Government, will be pres
ent. His attitude may be Judged by ex
tracts from letters Uiat he baa written to
members of the California State Asso
ciation for the storage of flood waters.
In one of these he says: "1 have always
believed that the Lord helps those who
help themselves, anil I think It a mistake
for any State to sit down and wait for the
Government." In another ia this passage:
"I see no necessary conflict between your
movement and the extension of aid by
the General Government. In fact, I do not
believe that the General Government will
do or can do all that is to be done. If
the convention should desire I will explain
the work of the irrigation investigation
of the Department of Agriculture relative
to the irrigation development in the sev
eral States."
Against the claims of the National Ir
rigation Association will be set forth that
the conditions in the report of Chittenden,
a rlvll engineer, upon which the nation
alists reply, do not apply to California.
His reasons for having the General Gov
ernment provide for Irrigating arid re
gions were that the -water supplies of the
arid States were complicated, but he ex
pressly excepted the Pacilic States, be
cause their water supplies are independ
ent; also, that the United States Is the
principal owner of the land in the arid
States. This is true of Wyoming, for In
stance, where the General Government
owns 90 per cent of the land. In Califor
nia the Government has very little arid
land. Also, It will be urged against the
Idea that the rental from the Govern
ment's arid lnnds v/ould be sufficient to
provide storage reservoirs â that the facts
contradict the theory. The United States
will not rent its forest reservations. Graz
ing lands in Nevada, superior to any arid
lands in California, bring very low rent
als, 175 beins the price for three sections
in one Instance.
A lively convention is certain.

ONE MILLION EACH FOR
IRVING M. AND H. T. SCOTT
Inside History of the Gigantic
Combine of Shipbuilders,
Entire Stock of Union Iron Works in
Escrow at Anglo-Californian Bank,
Big Figure Paid by Seligmans,
THE story published exclusively In
yesterday's Call that the Union Iron
Work â  had been absorbed by a gi
gantic ship-building syndicate organ
ized by the Sellgmans produced a pro
found impression in San Francisco. To
day The Call is able to place before its
readers a complete confirmation of the
story and supply many of the details con
nected with the negotiations which wero
not obtainable night before last.
Preliminary steps to consolidate under
one general management the leading ship
yards of the Atlantic coast and the Union
Iron Works of the Pacific were taken last
summer. The negotiations were conduct- ;
ed with extreme secrecy. It now trans- j
iplrei that before Henry T. Scott left this \
city on his recent Eastern trip all of the j
6took of the Union Iron Works was placed
â In escrow in the Anglo-Calif ornian Bank ,
of San. Francisco. This bank is the j
agency 1 of the Seligmans in California.
Some interesting- facts come to light re- j
Fording the price or prices of the stock, j
for as a matter of fact two prices were ,
considered and accepted. The active man- ,
agers of the works received a much larger
sum per share for their stock than was
paid to stockholders who had not par- '
Ticipated in the active affairs of building j
i^hips. All of the stockholders, however, I
acquiesced in this twofold arrangement. ]
Or.c reason assigned for giving to the !
active managers a big price for their hold- ;
Ings was the consideration that they were
in the enjoyment of lucrative salaries
and would therefore be called upon to
rinke great pecuniary sacrilices in gelling
their stock at the ordinary valuation,
Under the terms of the agreement the
<->rdinary stockholders receive $250 per
Fhare of stock. The favored holders, or
the active managers, receive for their
i-idings $s^o per share. The number of
shares of stock in the concern is 20,000,
hence if all the stock were sold at $2f<o per
share the aggregate price would he $5,
--000.000.
The original capital stock was $2,000,000,
and of this amount $1,250,000 was paid up.
The par value of the stock is $100 per
share.
The Call Is assured that all of the
Ftockholders are satisfied with the ar- I
rangements of the syndicate. The '
transaction is closed, barring the actual !
payment of money and the transfer of I
property. No doubt exists as to the ability
or design of the syndicate to execute ita ;
written obligations.
In deciding to sell out the stockholders
took into account that they had derived
large profits from the construction of !
ships for the United States navy. It is ,
paid that the Union Iron Works made a |
clear profit of $500,000 in the building of j
the coast defender Monterey. They :
reasoned further that Uncle Sam was now j
provided with a first-class navy, and i
building enterprises in this branch of
â¢work would not be brisk until some fu- i
ture time.
The stockholders of the Union Iron.
Works are: James 08. Gunn, Irving M.
Scott, Henry T. Scott, George W. Dickie,

Glee Club rendered "Hull, California" and
a snappy sea ballad. In introducing: Presi
dent Wheeler, Professor Bacon of Berke
ley s.'iid the former was just the kind of
man tho university wanted to turn out.
He paid a neat tribute to President
Wheeler in the following: words:
"When I say this I do not mean that
our main ambition is to turn out great
Greek scholars, though President Wheeler
is a great Greek scholar; neither is it our
ambition to turn out great historians, and
President -\\ hreli-r comes pretty near
being a great historian. He is the kind of
a man we want because he is an all-round
man, a man who is In sympathy with
every human In) -i, and we hope he is
going to help us turn out such men "
When Professor Wheeler stepped for
ward he was tendered a great welcome
from the large assemblage, and through
out his highly Interesting iecture he was
given the closest attention and hearty ap
plause. J l
At the outset the speaker traced the
history of atheltlcs, told of its importance
in Kngland and dwelt humorously on the
effort being made by the French to copy
their English neighbors. The mention of
Baron Coubetan i, Kr eat Frenchman
who conceived the Idea of holding thÂ«
Olympian games, was the signal for an
plause. The speaker told of the congress
that was called In 1894 and of the motion
of an American thai prevailed that the
iirst games be held at Athens, where It
had its baptism. A map of Greece was
then thrown on the canvas and the lec
turer gave a short description of the
country and a history of the games.
For almost ten centuries, he said the

NEW YORK, Nov. 11.â The Herald
Fays Jefferson Seilgman would give no j
explanation of the report from San ;
Francisco of a syndicate to control all
leading- shipyards of the country.
"There is nothing to be said now,"
said Mr. Seligrnan, "not a word."
"Is it true," I asked, "that the ship
yards mentioned are to be brought to
gether in one combination?"
Mr. lipman replied: "Just at this
time I will not discuss the matter. I
might say, perhaps, that the subject Is
not ripe for discussion at this time. I
am always willing to oblige the Her
ald, but we can say nothing now."
Henry Seligman affirmed that he
knew nothing about the plan to con
solidate shipyards.

SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 12, 1899.
DRINK-CRAZED PRISONERS PLOT
TO MURDER ON THE INDIANA
INCIDENTS OF HOME-COMING OF THE TENNESSEEANS.
THE transport Indiana, with tho I
First Tennessee Volunteers and 101 i
military prisoners from the I'hilip
. arrived in port yesterday |
morning after a voyage of thirty- '
three and a half days from Manila. Th*Â»
trip across the ocean was replete with
exciting Incident^, among which were the
â  the prisoners to take posses- i
sion of the ship and the startling discov- ;
cry w ssel was still five days
away from port that the supplies were all
but exhausted. The Indiana arrived off
of the Farailones Friday evening, but the
fog and ni'st were so dense that the offi- ;
c-rs decided not to run the risk of pass- .
ing into the harbor until yesterday morn- i
ing.
A* sonn as the ship was sighted the
Tennessee delegation which has been
awaiting the home coming of the troops
for several days went out to meet them
In the State tug Governor Markham, ae
companled by the Citizens' Committee on
the Governor Irwin. At the sight of the
people from their own State the boys
crowded to the rails and cheered and
otherwise gave expression to their pleas
ure at once again being in sight of Amer
ica's shores; for these boys have had
enough of the Philippines, and they are
probably in as good a position to Judge
the country across the seas as any of
the troops that have gone there. Not one
of them has a good word to say of the
Islands, or their future, and not one of
them will ever return there of his own
volition.
The citizens' Committee, the Tennessee
ption committee and many friends
and relatives of the soldiers kept along
side of the Indiana until she dropped an
i nor in the stream off the Government
dock. Then they rushed aboard of the
port, and for the rest of the day
had possession of the ship. Troops could
not possibly wish for a more sinccregreet
lng than those Tennessee boys received
from the people who had traveled across
the continent to meet them at the Goiden
Gate.
When the Indiana was off Alcatraz the
military prisoners were transferred to the
island on the tug: Fearless and their de
parture from the ship was a great relief
to the officers and every man on board.
From the time they were taken aboard
at Cavite they have been a source of con
tinual worriment to those in charge of
the ship. Lest Monday night the trouble
with them reached a climax, when they
broke through the bulkhead separating
their quarters from the commissary store
room and secured several cases of
whisky. Had they been moderate in con
suming it the theft would probably not
have been discovered until after the I
transport had docked, and the melee that ]
followed might have been averted.
The prisoners, however, attempted a
race against time in consuming every
drop of jpiritÃ in the storeroom. They
made Borne headway and about 10 o'clock
at night they became veritable demons
and broke loose. With a sudden rush
tiny splintered the wooden bars that
formed the front of their prison and scat
tered over the ship. The onslaught was
PD sudden that the guards were taken un
awares and the situation became serious.
The mon are reported to be of the most
desperate classâ criminals and outlaws
who managed to join the army without
the recruiting officers learning of their
true characters. With their vicious na
ture intensified by the liquor, they be
came bloodthirsty and vengeful and ran,
over the ship threatening to kill any one
who dared to check them. When the offl
eera became aware of the situation all of
the available men were called to duty
and a fearful hand to hand combat en
sued. The drunken prisoners fought with
virlousness. It was an act of providence
that they had not secured arms In their
mad run over the vessel, for there was
murder in them, and they would not have
hesitated to kill.
Commands to surrender seemed to make
them more determined to take possession
of the transport. They rushed at ihe sol
diers with their fists and had to be
clubbed back with the butt ends of rifles
and pistols. The orders had been given
to the soldiers not to shoot, unless as a
final resort, and the rebellious men had to
be literally beaten into insensibility be
fore they were quelled. A dozen or more
of the ringleaders of the revolt were put
in irons, while the rest of them were
placed in solitary confinement and kept
on a diet ct bread and water. What fur
ther punishment may be meted out to
thc-m when their action la formally re
ported to the authorities is problematical.
The pathetic incident of the trip oc
curred shortly after the Indiana cast an
chor in the stream. Private Frank F. Mc-
Neal of Company D, who had been sick
with dysentery but whose condition was
not considered serious, took a turn for
the worse eaxly in the day, and In. the
Break Loose on the Vessel That Brings the
Returning Tennessee Volunteers â¦
afternoon, when all was joy and gayety
among the troops, the word was |
that the man had died. During his lil
ness his one wish had been to see his rel
atives before the â¢nd came. The sur
ppoiiri assured him that he was In no
danger, but no matter how sincere they

The remains of five of the Tcnnessee
ans who lust their lives in the Philip
pines: were brought back on the transport.
They are those, of Private Orvill. Men ur,
who" died of typhoid August 30, 1893; Cor
poral J. C. BulliiiKton, killed by the in

B. Price, the victim of an awful mistake
September 12; Private William Hanley,
killed in the charge at El Pardo Septem
ber 22. and Private William Parrish, ac
cidentally killed March 19.
The story of the death of Corporal
Price has many tragic features. He was
one of the bravest of the brave of the
Tennesseeans. One night while his com
pany was camped near El Pardo, Cebu,
he rushed from his tent in his night
clothes and passed the picket lino before
he was noticed. He had a red cloth
wrapped around his head to protect him
from the mosquitoes, and in the darkness
had the appearance of being a Filipino.
When he was noticed beyond the lines
he was mistaken for an Insurgent and
shot by a member of the Sixth Infantry,
who was doing guard duty. Price's pecu
liar actions were explained by the tact
that he was subject to nightmare, and in
ono of thest delirious periods left his
ten".
The charge at El Pardo, where Private
Hanley lost his life, gave an example cf
the f.ghtlng stock of which the Tennessee
boys are made. The greater part of the
regiment embarked at Manila, Several
of the companies were at El Pardo. and
the Indiana stopped there to pick them
up.
The day of their arrival it was dis
covered that the insurgents had in
trenched themselves in a strong position
back in the hills. The soldiers, who
thought they were through with active
service, were ordered to assist In dislodg
ing the Filipinos. It needed no second
command. As soon as the Tennesseeana
learned that there was fighting to be done
they were eager to get at it. They made
a rush up the mountain side and, with a
yell that made them famous through the
campaign, scared the Filipinos into (light
and took possession of their position.
They were determined to exterminate
| every man in the trenches, and undoubt
edly would have done so had not the
enemy lied.
When they were packing \ip, making
ready to resume their journey home, a
lone Filipino who had hid in a tree shot
Hanley through the head. The Filipino
never had an opportunity to tell his com
rades what he had done.
The men on the transport complain that
they have been poorly fed on the voyage
and state that live days before reaching
port they were put on short rations be
cause It was discovered that the stores
had almost been exhausted. The officers
deny this and claim the story originated
from the natural tendency of the soldier
to find fault.
The Indiana Is in charge of Captain M.
H. Morle; J. D. Forbes, first olllcer; W.
A. Morehouse, second; George Toon,

and crossed the continent in three sec

IT, 1898. I; sailed tor Manila in two de
tachments, one under Colonel W. C
Smith coins- on the Zealandla, October 30
and the nth^r. under Lieutenant Colon*-
Grany Child ers, going on the City o:
Puebla, November <?. The two detach
ments arrived at Manila on November 2S
and December *>, respectively, going into
camp on the Paseo d<- Santa Lucia.
During the night of the insurgent out
break, February 4, the Tennessee boys
i stood under arms at the Punta Espana,
ready for any emergency, whether in the
city districts or on the tiring line. Early
the next morning, by order of General R.
P. Hughes, their brigade commander, the
i First Battalion, under Lieutenant Colonel
: Childers, reported to General Anderson, in
; the Paco district, south of the river: the
i Second Battalion, under Colonel Smith
i and Major Cheatham, to General Hale, in
; the Santa Mesa district, where the light
ing began, and the Third Battalion, under
Major McGuire, to General Mac Arthur, in
the Tondo district. Of the gallant work
of the three detachments throughout the
fighting of the sth and 6th of February,
the press reports spoke In the highest
terms and none too highly. The sons of
the sires who were in the "forefront of the
American line on the bloody field of Mon
terey and who won a place for the stars
and stripes on the bristling heights of
Chapultepec, proved on numerous occa
sions that they were worthy representa
tives of the "Volunteer State." But,
though in the very front of battle and in
flicting heavy losses on the enemy, who
numerously opposed them, not a man was
struck by a ball throughout the whole of
the two days' fighting. The loss of its
gallant commander, Colonel W. C. Smith,
a veteran Confederate soldier and the
hero of many a well-fought field, who
was stricken with apoplexy just as his
men were entering the fight and soon af
ter expired, was mourned by the entire
regiment.
On February 9 of this year the regi
ment sailed from Manila for Iloilo, Panay
Island, where It arrived at 11 p. m. oh
the 10th. The next day, after a short
bombardment of the place by the war ves
sels which accompanied the expedition,
the order for landing was given, and
within the space of an hour and a half the
whole regiment was on shore, and, in con

CHADBOURNE'S DREAM
OF OFFICE IS OVER
Gage Orders the Suit Against
Herold Dismissed,
The Governor Has Refused to Permit His
Victim to Keep the Gold Brick as a
Memento of Deceit.
Governor Gage has given another proof j
to the public that he does not possess
within him an element that will force him
to be true even to his friends.
M^re than this, California's chief execu
tive has demonstrated that after he has
sold a friend a gold brick he will rub the
friend of even the grim satisfaction of
keepir.gr the brick as a reminder of official
duplicity. Colonel F. S. Chadbourne is
the latest victim of the Governors deceit.
The colonel is smiling painfully at the
raillery of his associates and accepting
with patience and resignation the jokes
of his acquaintances. He thought that he
had won from Gage a remote reward and
a dubious honor. Ho has awakened now
to the interesting fact that he has re
ceived neither. The feelings of the colonel
have been trifled with, and after months
of weary waiting and anxiety his dream
of dominion on the water front has I n
dispelled. He will not receive the c
position hfld by Rudolph Herold Jr. as
Harbor Commissioner, and Gage hns not
even deigned to tell his victim of thi
ceit. which outsiders have already discov
ered.
Tho story of the colonel's burst bubble
is interesting.
During the gubernatorial campaign Col
onel Chadbourne rendered to the Republi
can party services which the managers
and seme of the leaders considered val
uable. The colonel naturally considered
that he was entitled to some reward. His
tastes are not averse to the flavor of po
litical loaves and fishes, and his hands
were extended in natural eagerness for
them. He had been a Harbor Commis
sioner and his friends supported his
claims for reappointment. His successor
was Rudolph Herold Jr., and the colonel
smiled gleefully in the prospect that he
would return to the board. With his hope
| of returning his ambition soared and he
I laid plans to be appointed president of the
j board of which he had been a member.
Then came the first disenchantment.
1 There was a question in ref. r< nee to the
: number of leeal vacancies in the Board of
Harbor Commissioners. To the ordinary
I mind there was only one vacancy; to the
VICTOR AND VANQUISHED.
legal brain there was a suggestion of two.
Rudolph Herold Jr. had been appointed
by Governor Budd and confirmed by the
State Senate several months before there
was a vacancy.
There was therefore a chance to ques
tion the legality of his appointment. Gov
ernor Gage seized upon the chance as a
good opportunity to present Charlbourne
with a gold brick. While Chadbourne
had. he thought, done something for his
party he was not as close in the affec
tions of Gage as Dan Burns. The man
from Mexico demanded that Paris Kil-
Pages 11 to 20 !
burn be given the presidency of the H^ir
bor Commission, and Cage, ; is a matter
of duty, obeyed. Chadbourne was dum
founded, and ins dismay increased when
he learned that he i. Belected by
Gage to contest the position occupied by
Hi rold En â¢â  lo" of securing a rich prize
he had been given a number in a legal
lottery that might not win. lie finds now
that the number not only did not win,
bui it was bogus. The gold brick wad
not even gil<
The Governor had taken this cheap
method with which to get rid of tt
nial colonel, wl dered such gal
lant service on the staff of Governor
Budd. Gage declared that Heroid's ap
pointment, being made and confirmed -o
many months before the expiration of his
predecessor's term, was Illegal.
He therefore appointed Chadbourne to a
lawsuit. The colonel accepted the gift
and then face,; another difficulty. He
could not even bring suit against llendd
without permission of the Attorney Gen
eral, whose consent must be obtained In
actions where the State seek:-; to become a
plaintiff.
The consent of Attorney General Ford
was nut difficult t" obtain, (lage com
manded him to give It, and he did so.
And thus Colonel Chadbourne, in his own
interesting self, became the people of tho
State. Suit was instituted in April, and
Knight & Heggerty became attorneys f<T
Chadbourne. The colonel was almost
crushed, lie referred contemptuously t"
Kilburn as a "chairwanner" and thought
longingly of the chair he would 111
keep from getting cold. Week .ifter week
ined. The colonel's
lawyers were the most accommodating
in the world to their opponents.
.Meanwhile Chadbourne was becoming a
political heretic, and took no pain;, to
disguise his opinion that Gage was a.
stuffed political prophet. This heresy
came to the ears of the Governor, and the
chair in the Harbor Commissioners' office
v. as lost to the colonel forever. The Gov
ernor began to speak disparagingly of the
colonel's political prowess, even sneering
at his ability to bombard the enemy with
the artillery of his lungs.
The fact that the colonel has adorned
the staff of Governor Budd became
picious. Gage lost neither time nor op
portunity to indicate that Chadbourne had
fallen from his high estate. These symp
toms of gubernatorial biliousness were
not lost upon the friends of Herold.
They went to Gage and begged him to
permit the Hart "r < 'ommissioner to retain
his place. The Governor was not adverse
'to the proposition. He said that he was
sorry anyway that he had appointed
Chadhourne, and he would not have done
so ha;l he not confused Herold with some
one else of the. same name who had
fought him.
With this encouragement the friends of
Herold worked with renewed energy.
Time for action was growing short, and
the legal determination of the issue in
court could not much longer be postponed.
Every legal subterfuge for delay had been
used and Gage was asked to "end it all.
He did so by commanding Attorney Gen
eral Ford to withdraw the consent of tho
State to the suit instituted by Chadbourne
and to order the dismissal of the action!
Ford has done so and the sad news will
be broken officially to-day by the attor
neys to Chadbourne. The suit will prob
ably bo dismissed to-morrow in Judge.
Murasky'e court, where it is now pending.

ground to-day. West Point played a good
frame, but was unable to prevent her line
being- forced and her ends circled for tell
ing grains. Weeks especially excited the
wonder of the spectators. A light, steady
rain prevailed, which made the ball hard
to hold, and fumbling was a marked fea

ends wore unable to cover the ground
and Columbia continually ran back for
good gains, while on the other hand La

CALIFORNIANS VANQUISH OLYMPICS IN
A SENSATIONAL FOOTBALL GAME
State University 15, Olympics 0.
ajyZ SWEEPING victory for Califor-
II \\ nia was the result of the foot
/ \ ball gai â¢ aft
cJ V> ernoon on th th and Fol-
som street -
during the entire match were the Olym
pics near the scoring point, and not for
a moment did the game lag in interest.
It was easily the best contest of the
season both from the football point of
view and the picturesque variations fur
nished by a field that was beyond corn
paripon.
The twenty-two athletes who made hu
man toboggans of themselves and wal
lowed on a gridiron soft and rich with
oozing mud bi came metamorphosed ob
jects two minutes after the fame began.
Never was any Held In a w rse < inditlon.
Without exaggeration the mud was knee
deep and of that soft consistency which
makes duck? happy philosophers. By way
of swamp variation a few puddles studded
the gridiron, and those served from time
to time as bftthing places for the be
grimed and bespattered athletes. Every
tin:'- the rival teams came together there
was a squirting of a muddy solution
through the open spaces in the pack. Now
and again cakes of earth would fall from
the players, and to eyes dimmed with
lumps of slimy earth it was mistaken for
;^skin. That is why California made
so much ground on the Olympics.
T! c game began with a kick-off by
Kaarsberg. Thirty yards away the fresh
and yellow ball dropped Into the hands of
ErskJi were wet and he
d the pigskin and a California end
fell on it. All the players, seemingly jeal
ous of the blue and gold man's mud bath,
followed suit. After ;hat twenty-two dis
tinct identities were merged and mud was
the name of the composite. Then Cali
fornia started to slide and slip down the
field.
Through the mud the college boys cut
their way, and in a very few minutes of
play Smith I out the first ti
down of the game. No i^a! was kicked.
Mr. Cadwalader kicked off from the
center to Bills, whom no quantity of mud
could stay, and he covered twenty yards
before being slapped in the mire. The
next signal ended in a punt by Kaarsberg,
CARLISLE'S
ELEVEN IS
SHUT OUT
Indians Fail to Score in a
Hard-Fought Game With
Princeton.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Xi;\V YORK, Nov. 11.â The Prlnootnn
football team took the Carlisle Indians
into camp on Manhattan Hold this after
-1 1 in, 1 ut had a difficult time doing it.
Princeton scored two touchdowns, one in
half, and Ihe goals wore successfully
kicked, making the total at the finish 12
to 0 in favor of the Tigers. The result,
while not unlooked for, was a crusher
Just the same for ihe red men. Their vic
tory over Pennsylvania and tlu-ir double
against Harvard warranted a hot
ter showing for the Indians, but, although
beaten, they put up sun-h a formidable
that they proved themselves worthy
of the respect which is paid them in the
football world.
The paid attendance was between 3090
airl 7000, the majority of whom carried
Princeton colors. Fully twice that num
ber witnessed the game from
points cf vantaKe.
At the call of time the teams lined up,
I'riin i !â  n !. â¢ Ing the ball. Wheeler kicked
off to Metoxen, and after lour minutes'
play Knight, right halfback for Prince
ton, skirted Carlisle's right end for a
fortjr-flve-yard run and planted the ball
behind the lino with the assistance of
magnificent Interference. The l>all when
n turned v/as away to the north sli
the KriOiron, making a pnnt-ln necessary.
This wap clone successfully, and Wh
kicked a goal, making the score G to U in
favor of Princeton.
Then Princeton enthusiasm let loor,e
and bedlam reigned for a minute. Some
300 Princeton students in one of tin
Btands sang their university anthem, at
the conclusion of which the cheers broke
out afresh. From thi3 to the end of tne
first half the game was stubbornly con
tested, and the Indians held the Tigers
so closely that Princeton was unable to
pass Carlisle's fifteen-yard line. All the
galus that Princeton made were accom
KAARSBERG OF THE CAUFORNIAS BREAKING LOOSE FOR
A RUN.
I but the Olympics could do nothing with
the ball, and Cadwalader was forced to
punt again. For a month the enthusiasts
! have been looking for Percy Hall to show
I himself in old familiar style. The next
! play satisfied them. He was passed the
; ball and, heavy as the field was, he
, skirted the Olympic left end and dredged
i his way for thirty-five yards before hlx
face was clogged with boggy earth. The
goal line was within range, and five yards
at a slide came the California scoopers.
: Within a step of another touchdown the
I blue and gold fumbled the ball and It
' went to the Olympics, soon to be put out
of danger.
But the touchdown was what California
wanted, and the Olympics were battered
against until their ten-yard line was
: reached. Here they stuck together, and
"Looomotor" Smith failed to puncture the
j line, the ball going to the clubmen.
Again Cadwalader punted, but Kaars
berg -"Peter, the Stanford Eater," as his
sobriquet runsâ made the pigskin a part
of himself and didn't stop running until
he had covered twenty-five yards of the
choicest uiiiu that ever adorned a grid-
Iron cr a farm. Not a moment elapsed
before California's team wa.s on foot and
ready for the touchdown that was but a
yard off. A turtle back play through
Eraklne netted the second touchdown of
the game, and the wildly enthusiastic
rooters on the wet but clean grand stand
Bhouted in real football ecstacy. Five
minutes more of oscillating play ended
the first half.
It would have been an Augean labor to
free the twenty-two mud-shedding pig
skin chasers from the swamp fields

the Indians were weakest.
' The second half was productive of nu
merous casualties, several men on both
Hides being forced to retire. Both teams
suffered, but during the intermission none
of the Indians left the Held. A few of
them lay down on blankets, but the ma
jority stood on their feet, while all of
the Princeton players had to resort to
massage treatment in the clubhouse.
When time was called the Indians were
just as frisky as ever, albeit one or two
of them limped slightly. The Tigers lined
up as in the first half, looking none the
worse for wear. Substitute after substi
tute was called upon on both sides owing
to the fierce play In this half.
After a series of end plays the ball was
landed on the Indians' five-yard line.
Hodgman was pushed over for Prince
ton's second touchdown and Mills kicked
the goal, making the score Princeton 12,
Carlisle 0. From this time to the call of

CAMBRIDGE. Nov. 11.â Harvard beat
Dartmouth to-day on Soldiers' field by a
packed around them, so the trainers did

sponges on their faces.
Calwalader, with a temporarily clean
face, started the last lap by a kick-off
| for thirty yards and Ellis caught the ball,
1 bringing It back to the center. Kaars
; berg then punted for about the same dis
tance and Dinsmore was downed where
!ho stood by the California ends. Once

After this the Blue and Gold did every

kicks and Cadwalader's "charley-horse"
thigh forced him to quit the game.

i together and they all aid their work.
Beaten but not disheartened the Olym

score of 11 to 0. A drenching: ratn fell be

was a mass of mud. Harvard played a
wretched game after the first two min

counting li.c many times it was dropped
and recovered by the quickness of Har
vard's own players.
Hallowoll's punting was good In spite
of slippery ground and poor passing from
center. He continually outpunted I'roc
tor and had none of his kicks blocked.
From every point of view the game was
discouraging. The tackling was careiess
and loose, allowing the Dartmouth hack
to gain often after they should have
downed. Toward the close of the flrst half

Pennsylvania Wins by
Single Point From the
Western Team.
Special Ittspatch to The Call.
PHILADELPHIA. Nov. 11 -In the
fiercest game played on Franklin field
this year the University of Pennsylvania
football team this afternoon defeated the
University of Michigan eleven, 11 to 10.
The game was a battle royal from start
to finish and was marked by brilliant and
poor playing by both teams. Pennsyl
vania earned her victory, because she
had to play harder for her two touch
downs than did Michigan. The Michigan
team made most of its gains on runs
around Pennsylvania's left end, which
was lamentably weak, while Pennsyl
vania had to pain her ground by fierce
plunging through the line.
The game was a beautiful one for the
spectators. Both teams were about as
evenly matched as they could be. The
Quakers excelled in line bucking and
kicking, while Michigan far outplayed
Pennsylvania when it came to skirting
the ends. McLean, Michigan's left half
back, was almost invariably used for end
running. The interferences accorded him
were almost perfect and this in a great
measure helped him in gaining ground.
Pennsylvania showed her old-time form
in line bucking and Michigan was seldom
able to hold the Quakers in their terrible
plunges with the aid of the guardsback.
In the kicking line Coombs had no
trouble in outpointing Street, who did the
kicking for Michigan. The duel between
Cunningham and Overfield, the center
rushes, was interesting. Both are high
class players and they played with a dash
that was inspiring. Cunningham had
much the better of it during the first
half, but in the second period Overfield,
through better staying qualities, made
big holes through Michigan's center.
Both teams fumbled badly and at criti
cal moments. Pennsylvania was the
worse offender and probabiy would have
made another touchdown in the first half
had not one of the men let the ball slip
through his fingers. The Michigan team
was frequently penalized for offside play
ing, in fact, more than any two teams
that have played on Franklin field this
year. The game, however, was a fair
and clean one.
The game ended with the ball In Penn
sylvania's possession on Michigan's
forty-five yard line. The line up:

BIFLEMEN AT THE HANGE.
Many Clubs Preparing for Their An
nual Turkey Shoots at Shell
Mound Park.
There are to be several Important rifle
shooting events on the Shell Mound range
to-day. The San Francisco Schuetzen
Vereln, in addition to its regular â¢ class
medal contests, will have a turkey shoot.-
The iir.st three shots, possible 75 rings, on
the medal string will count for turkeys.
Those making th best scores in the three
will secure me larger birds. The Nord
deutscher Schuetzen Club also hoi a
turkey shoot in connection with its bulls
eye contest for cash prizes. The members
of the Qerxnania Schuetzen Club will like
wise contest for their Christmas dinners,
best scores counting for largest fowls.
In accordance with his custom Captain
L. Siebe, proprietor oi the Shell Mound
range, will give a prize shoot- at the close
of the season on the 26th inst. Ten tur
keys, live pigs and ten geese will be com
peted for by riflemen.
Next Sunday Captain Fred Schueman,
manager or" the California Schuetzen,
range near San Rafael, will give a turkey
shoot as a wind-up of the season, and his
offer is so liberal that every rifleman will
have a chance to secure a bird. The Cali
fornia Schuetzen, Grutll and Eintracht
clubs will hold turkey shoots on the same
day.
In many places in the East for years
past the riflemen have held on election
day what is known as a rifle match for
individual championship, 100 shot 200
yards, off hand. In 1893 In New York Fred
C. Ross made a score of 2194 rings, Ger
man, 25-ring target int. In ISOS-6-7
Ross was again high with 2222, 2225 and
2215. The highest ten-shut string In these
contests was made in 1893 by G. W.
Planted, who made 233 rings.
A number of marksmen of the California
Schuetzen Club met in an individual
championship match at Shell Mound on
election day. The results of the 100-shot
runs in 10-shot strings were as follows:
F. E. Mason, 215, 213, 233, 255, 223, 21S,
226 214 213 219â2209. F. P. Schuster, 2209,
231, 224, 230. 216. -lv 218, 220, 209, 229â2204.
D ' W. McLaughlin, 221, 229, 217, 220, 224,
216, 202, 227, 226, 199â 2181.
F. W. Be.knap and C. M. Henderson
also shot in the match, making 196S and
1991 respectively. A comparison of the
scores of Mason with those previously
submitted shows that in the past six
years the 2209 rings of the Western marks
man were excelled but three times, and
then only by probably one of the best
riflemen in the world. In Mason's 235
rings in ten shots he beat Plaisted, who
previously held the record ten-shot string
in Individual championship matches. In

I'ully applied some of the money, receipts

own Individual use arid In excess of the
*hare either of them was entitled to, and
that by reason thereof they have become
indebted to the copartnership and im

tober 1 defendants have fused to per
mit plaintiff to employ himself about the
business or to share in any or the re

that Davie Is not now nor ever was In any

DEADLY WIRES
ABE DISOWNED
BY EVERYBODY
One Victim Asks Aid
of the Mayor.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
Broadway, Nov. 11,
Dangling telephone and telegraph wires
will probably be made the subject of local
legislation as they will certainly be of
local litigation after the serious accident
which befell young Partington and John
Y. Green of the Street Department a
week ago.
Green called on the Mayor this morning,
showed him his badly burned hands and
arms and asked for a reference to the
City Attorney, so that the latter might
bring suit for damages In his behalf
against the company owning the wire
which caused the accident. The Mayor
decided that he would suggest to the
Council the passage of an ordinance
which would prevent a recurrence of such
an accident by imposing heavy penalties
on companies leaving loose wires and un
used wires hanging down so that they
may kill or maim human beings or anl
mais. . .
"I would be frightened to walk across
the top of the City Hall." said the Mayor,
"because of the supposedly dead wires
hanylng around and which are likely at
any moment to become alive."
From Intimations given out by the tele
phone company It Is plain that it intends
to disclaim responsibility for the maiming
'artlngton and Green on the ground
that the wires causing the damape v. -u
not owned by the corporation. The wires
thit burned Partington and Green were
not in use at the time of the accident, and
i across the electric railroad wire at
once became charged with the deadly cur
rent. The telephone com], any v. as notified

wires that caused the frightful accident.
One of thos< - ted with the company
lias said that the wires formerly belonged

although they were placed on Its poles.
Within the next two weeks the trial of

QUEER LEGAL TANGLE
GVER NISSEN ESTATE
Question of Whether Husband or Wife
Perished First in a Shipwreck
Undetermined.
OAKLAND. NOV. 11. -A petition for the I
distribution of the estate of Captain Hen
ry Nissen, who with his wife and children
perished in the wreck of the American
bark C. C. Funk off the coasi of Tasmania
In August, 1898, was denied by Superior
Judge Hall Co-day because of the Insuffi
ciency of th" evidence as to whether the
captain or his wife perished first The de
tails of the. case were fully reported In
The Call several months ago.
While the law presumes that where hus
band and wife perish la the same calam
ity, bom being between the ages of 15 and
60 years, the wife succumbs first belnK
d the weaker, an attempt is belnS
to show that the captain was 4u
years of age at the time of his death and
er, a Bist< r of the wife, testified
that the latter was also 40 years of age
The question of whether the captain per
ished first will determine whether his S4iWÂ»
estate shall bo distributed to his six
brothers and sisters, or to Mrs Nissen's '
two sisters.
The latter claim that two survivlnr
sailors testified before the Insurance ad- I
Juster at Melbourne, Australia, who sur- '
veyed the wreck, that after the captain '
bad been swept overboard and drowned '
tlu> wifi> a in! children were .se<-n eline-ine i
to the bark's rigging. To establish^ the :
correctness of Mrs. Nlssen's Ulster's con- I
tentions Judge Hall ordered commissions I
to issue to take the insurance adjuster's
deposition at Melbourne, also the deposi
tion of Mrs. Hnmm and six hi-irs in Perm- '
sylvanla. It has been impossible to locate I
tlio two surviving sailors. Peterson and
Krug. The case will again come up be
fore Judge Hall on December 2S.
NEARLY MURDERED BY
A BOLD HIGHWAYMAN
OAKLAND, Nov. 11.â John Harrington

went to the Receiving Hospital, and it

gash on the back of the head and neck
Inflicted by the robber's knit..
Harrington and a friend were driving
Into Oakland :'n>m San Pablo, and when
about one mile outside of West Berkeley
a stranger halted them and asked if they
would take him aboard. They said they
had all their rig would carry, and while
they were talkimr the fellow drew a knife
and quickly made a lunge, at Harrington's
head. Bofore the assailant could make
another attack the horse was lashed up
and the two men did not stop until they
reached the hospital. Harrington is a
painter and lives in West Oakland. He
baa no doubt that his assailant's motive
was robbery.

KUCK'S LICENSE
MAY ESTABLISH
A NEW RECORD
Some Members Are
Seeking Cover.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Nov. 11.
Next Monday evening there will be one
of the periodical battles royal over the
' granting of a saloon license which oc
i cur about every three months. This time
I the cause of trouble is tho renewal of
| the license of Kuck's saloon on Twelih
street, and although the *oui members
] of the License Committee voted last night
1 to deny Mr. Kucks a renewal there is
much doubt as to whether six "-otes can
be obtained to vote against him on Mon
day night.
The members of the Council v!<--w with
j dread these license squabbles, as it al
ways forces them to "go on record." This
going on record Is never pleasart and on
Monday the lines will have to be drawn
very straight. Messrs. Barstow, Upton,
! (Jirard and Stetson will of course oppose
' this license, and they depend upuii tne
â  votes of MeeÃe and Rowe or of Cuvel
lier to prevent its renewal. Mr. Mott. 'he
j other member <>f the License Committee.
i has already stated his position, which la
; that so long as Kucka obeys the city or
; dinances n<> will not show any discrimina
j tion as between one saloon-keeper and
another.
Councilman Cuvellier stated la<=t wÂ»o|;
! in meeting that he agreed with the ideas
of Mr. Mott, but since the very powerful
i showing made last night by Rev. Dr.
Coyle, Rev. <". H. Hobart, Rev. C. R.
; Brown and the delegation of ladies, a
! special effort Is to be made to induce
Mr. ''uvilier to change his mind. It is
well known that Messrs. Shaffer, Kramm.
Mott and Taylor pretty well a^ree upon
th>i proposition that so long as the nty
Issues licenses there should be no dis
crimination.
One Councilman makes his defense upon
the fact that when th*Â» question of clos
ing the saloons was submitted to the peo
ple two years ago genf-ral interest was
shown by th*> large vote polled, a total
of 8835 votes being recorded out of abmit
10,000. On this occasion the question was.
j Shall the Faloons be closed all he time?
: and the result showed that 3732 voters
favored (.he measure, while ."ins voters op
â  poped it. showing a majority of 1371 in
favor of licensing saloons in this city.
This is na id by those, anxious to justify
their conduct in granting licenses to be
a Justification of thf-ir action, provided
thr- Police Department does not make
cnmplaint that an individual saloon .s
not living up to the letter and spirit of
the city ordinances, and it does not ap
pear that this has been done in the case
of Kucks.
WILL CONTEST ELECTION
OF DISTRICT ENGINEERS
AT.AMEDA, Nov. 11.â Frank A. Mess
n(-r, foreman of the Thompson Hose
Company, has filed with the City Clerk
a notice of appeal from the acti, n of the
Hoard of Foremen and Engineers who, on
the evening of October 12, declared tnat
F. K. Millington and A. E. Cumbers were
duly elected assistant engineers of the
lirst .and second lire districts, respect
ively.
In his complaint Messner alleges that
the election of the district engineers was
conducted in an irregular and wholly
illegal manner, and asks that the Eoaid
of City Trustees order another election
in order that it may be properly and
rightly determined as to who are entitled
to the positions of district engineers
Messner claims that previous to the
election in question he, being a duly
elected and qualilied member ot the Board
of Foremen and Engineers, moved that
the "iflces of district engineers Bhould be
declared vacant before their successors
could be chosen and that he was ruled
out of order by the chief, who was cnair
man, and the election was carried out
with technically no vacancies to be iHied.
It Is also alleged that both Millington
and Cumbers were allowed to vote tor
themselves for the posistions >>f assist
ant engineers, while this privilege was
denied both their opponentsâ George T.
Morris and H. Eckstein. Cumbers, it is
alleged, ;vas not a duly elected and iuÂ«ili
ried foreman of any company in the de
partment and was not then a member of
the Board of Foremen ami Engineers.
Papers setting forth the grounds of con
test have beÂ«n served upon Millington
and Cumbers and a copy of the same
filed with the City Clerk. The matter now
rests with the City Trustees for adjust
ment. The Trustees will probably tfike
away the nower of election of assist ml
engineers from the members of the de
partment and make the office an appoint
ive one, as was done in the matter of The
election cf the Chief of the Fire Depart
ment.
HER SQUABS WERE
SOLD BY A "BARON"
OAKLAND, Nov. 11.â In the suit of
Eliza Scnomberg against C. M. Day.
formerly an Alameda Constable, for the
recovery of the price of several hundred
squabs and pigeons sold by one "Baron"
Baroteau, an ex-Deputy Constable, under
attachment, judgment for 1125 and costs
was given by Judge Ogden to-day in favor
of the fair plaintiff, who gained consid
erable notoriety some months ago when
she caused the arrest of R. Mott, a motor
man, on a charge of assaulting her with
a revolver at the othce of her attorney in
the Blake. & Moffltt building. The present
suit was an appeal from Justice Larue's
court, and the trial occupied several days,
requiring the testimony of numerous pig
eon experts. It appears that in January,
L 897, -Miss Mary Walker sued C. V. Fitch
for a feed bill. An attachment issued and
was levied on 893 pigeons and squabs, and
these wero sold on execution. Later MiftS
Schomberjt sot up a claim of a half In
terest in the pigeons, suing Day for $299,
the value she placed upon the birds.

ised to be the beginning of a venture which offered an opening for any
capita! which might be put into its development. Although fairly sanguine
in their hopes, the men who were putting their capital Into the scneme ex "
pected their return to come altogether from the oil, in which the wens 01
the locality were found to abound.
To-day the news comes from Orinda Park that a still further discovery
has been made. Aside from oil. gypsum and a crude asphaltum. the region
has been found to contain an unexpected supply of natural gas. In just what
quantities it exists, and its adaptability for household consumption, has not
yet been determined. The experts on the ground, however, are said to have
stated that enough is present of sufficient good quality to supply household
illumination for the three cities of Oakland. Alameda and Berkeley.
The American Oil and Refinery Company, which is conducting the ex
cavations for the sake of the oil In the region, look upon the discovery as of
sufficient Importance to Induce them to withdraw all the unsold stock which
was being put on the market for the sake of developing the oil Interest. It
1b rumored that sufficient capital has been advanced from private sources to
enable them to turn toward the natural gas. with a view of ultimately put
ting that commodity upon the market In the cities on this side of the bay.

Opium, laudanum or yen she addiction cured. Cured without? pain or suf-
fering. Cured without the slightest injurious effect, and CURED FOR LIFE.
The remedy does the curing by antidoting every atom of the drug In the
system. That cures the habit and all desire for the drug and makes the cure
PERMANENT.
GI YONG YEN,

That marvelous Chinese specific is nature's true antidote for the drug
habit. It is the only known antidote In the world. All others are simply
"reduction" cures. They all contain morphine and require from two to three
months. They leave the system loaded with the drug, and sooner or later the
desire for it drives the patient back into his habit.
In Gi Yong Yen we have the only perfect, the ideal, cure.
No. 1 Cures in 3 to 5 Days.
No, 2 Cures in 14 Days.
No. 2 contains the full antidotal properties of the No. 1, and therefore
cures every case of the morphine or opium addiction without the possibility
of failure. The patient may deposit the fee in any responsible hands, and I
will deposit an equal amount with it. In case I fail to cure the habit thor-
oughly, without pain or suffering, harmlessly, with all desire for the drug
completely removed, and In three to five days, the patient will take the
whole amount. No patient Is restrained in any manner, but enjoys his full
liberty. He is not ill or confined to his bed a moment. There is no purging
or other unpleasant symptoms. And the cure is absolute in any and evwy
case, no matter how bad. There is no excuse for any person to continue in a
habit that is destroying both his own and his family's prosperity and happi-
ness. Call or write in confidence. Hours â 10 a. m. to 4 p. m., and 7 to S p. m.

BITTER CONTEST OF
THE PRYALS DECIDED
OAKLAND, Xov. 11.â Judge Ogden to
day rendered a decision in the content
over valuable property of Mrs. Mary A.
Pryal In favor of the surviving husband,
A. D. Pryal.
Mrs. Pryal died about three years ago,
having previously deeded all of her prop
erty to her eldest son, William A. Pryal.
The other children sought to have the
deed set aside, alleging it to be held in
trust for all the children, and the hus
band next set up a claim to the property
on the ground that a considerable portion
of the same was a homestead, which
should revert to him, the remainder being
community property. The contest waged
was very bitter, and during its pendency
members of the family have figured in
minor court trials brought about by con
flicts that at times presaged a serious
end.

SCORES THE GRAND JURY.
Father Caraher Declares That That
Body Is Making Itself Liable
to Arrest.
Editor of The Callâ Dear Sir: My attention
has been directed to a most Â»urpriÃlng article
In your Journal of last Friday headed: "Hotel
Nymphla In Favor With the Grand Jury; Be
! lleve It Should Remain Open." As I thought
that the Jury might have bean unintentionally
misrepresented I have waited for a comradic
' tlon of the action and statemerts with which
they have been credited, but as no such contra
' diction haa appeared I now feel constrained to
! deal with the case.
At the outset let me etate that It Is my belief
' that In the history of Grand Juries In thlÂ«
I rei.ub.lla no such conduct Is to be found as
â¢ that which Is attributed to San Francisco' â 
! present body, and that seldom. If ever, has
there been a greater cause fcr a Judge to dis
charge a Jury abruptly and dishonorably. The
j urora are represented as favoring the Nymphla
bi'nth'el and as taking steps to keep it open.
they so grossly ignorant as not to know
that they are sanctioning a cr'me condemned
by the laws of God and of man? Are they
bo devoid of all legal knowledge aa not to
know that thpy are acting In violation of the
i statute of the Legislature whl^h they have
sworn not only to observe but also to preserve
Inviolate? Are they so purblind ss not to see
t lit they are abetting prostitution, which Is
! condemned by the code, and thus making them
selves llabie to arrest for a misdemeanor? Let
them make their fa\ rable report of the
Nymphia. as they ari> alleged to have pr. -
posed, but we will stand them In the dock as
we did the notorious directors of the Twinkling
Htar Company, nnd we will pillory them before
the public as the promoters ar.d Incubators of
shameful and sickening Immoralities.
This Grand Jury has gone far beyond the
j sphere of Its duties. Its duty is to take cog
nizance of the violations of the law a
call the attention of the court to these rio
lations. But instead of discharging their
bounden duty they are abettins and further
â  ing the violation of the law. and th->y are in
! terferlng and tampering with a case that is
1 already in two of our Superior Courts. In the
, name of Justice, of law and of morality I ask:
; the impaneling .Tudpc to take cognizance of
! these men and to render them puwtrless for
! evil.
The Jurors are represented as having unani
mously declared that the revolting Nymphia is
"a necessary evil." They might as" well de
clare that burglary, garroting and murder are
necessary evil? and the law makes no distinc
tion between these crimes and those committed
in the Nymphia, except In degree. Prostitu
tion is> condemned by a section of the code, it
! hap been condemned by the decisions of the
, Supreme Court, and as a consequence no con
| tract made with the managers and inmates of
houses of ill-fame, as such, is valid. If the
I Nymphia be necessary, how have New York
i Boston and th" cities and towns of this repub
lic existed without similar cesspools? Chief of
: Police Byrne of New York was hurled from
office a few years ago, because he was said to
wink at the existence of the ordinary houses of
ill fame, and the Chief of the Detective Depart
ment of a certain Eastern city, who visited
; San Franr-isco lately, exclaimed in amazement
: when he saw the Nymphia: "Is It possible that
; Sa-n Francisco can tolerate and stand for such
a place?"
f According to the press report the Jurors are
] to Invite a number of business men and liberal
â  clergy to 00-oj.prate with them" In their fath
| erly care for the Nymphia. The fetid den has
i been already unanimously condemned In court
I by a Jury of upright business men who brought
â  in a verdict of guilty against its directors; It
. has been declared a nuisance by the Board or
I Supervisors -md it has been denounced by every
pure and moral man and woman In Sari Fran
cisco.
"The liberal clergy will be Invited to co-op
erate!" Degraded and vitiated, indeed, must
be the clergyman that would approve of the re
volting Nymphia. A loud cry of indignation
has been raised against it by the clergymen of
every crÂ»>efi and color in this section of the city
and a louder and bma.ler cry would have been
raised had it not been generally believed that
the sickening den were sooner to b;> closed
But the jurors will reccommend "that the
i city levy a tax on thÂ» Nymphia's business and
Insist upon the resort being conducted under
; rules framed by the authorities." That Is, they
; will reccommend the legalizing and licensing < '*
crime and will court impea^hm.-nt. "U'e will
calmly and fearlessly await their action.
And now, Mr. Editor, let me re-state some
. of my reasons and those of my brother clergy-
I men of all denominations for the crusade
j against the Nymphia. Firstly, this abomina
, tinn exists In violation of the laws of God and
of the State, It Is a disgTace to civilization and
in its eigantic form is mining morality In this
city. Had it not been checked in its Infancy
t would be now treble its present size for S
P. Blumenberg declared when selling stock that
: he Intended to pack In this vicinity all the
fallen women Âf Pan Francisco. To deceive thÂ«?
public the loathsome resort has r<?*n called a
"hotel," an<i on the business cards that are
freely distributed, beside the words "Nymphia
Hotel, ' is a red cross on the left upper corner,
showing that the managers have stolen the
livery of heaven to serve the devil in! I say
that the unwary and Innocent will be deceived
and entrapped by this lying card and led Into
ruin.
Secondly, the Nymphia Is situated at the
Junction of the two principal thoroughfares of
this section of the city, and Its hideousness
nnd rottenness must be encountered by the In
habitants who 'ravel from north to south or
east to west. o r vice versa. It is passed morn-
Ing and evening by thÂ» little children attending
ihe Day Home on Powell street, by our hoys
and girls who attend the day nnd night I
and children of tender years are allowed to
enter it and gaie upon Its ghastly horrors
Thirdly, a." foreseen, this neighborhood has
become uninhabitable for pure, decent men ar.d
wnmen by reason of the Nymphia It has be
come the rendezvous of hundreds of drur.kt n
and lecherous soldiers and sailers, who are
attracted to the Nymphia as turkey buzzards
to a carcass.
Finally. Mr. Krtitor, I have no doubt about
the near and permanent closing of the Nymphia
Morality, religion, decency and self-respect are
too strong In th<* community to permit mufti
longer its existence, the present and incoming
officials regard it with horror and the corrupt
power that has kept it so long open will ->oon
disappear and dissolve. T CARAHER.

quite a favorite in the Philippines, where,
under a warm sun. its intoxicating effects
are fully appreciated. A gun barrel is
generally used by the natives in prepar

vailing that the drink thus compounded
absorbs some of the peculiarly effective
fighting qualities of the gun and gives
strength accordingly.
More deadly than rice wine is barley

been brought to grief by a couple of
glasses of this palatable intoxicant. It is
sometimes mixed with lemon Juice to
deaden the effects, but for the average
American the fascinating flavor is de

Lazuli as if he were a pedigreed poodle
In order to' protect his own life; so says
the horoscope. Then Lazuli, finding the
King to be his successful rival in love,
threatens suicide. Was ever a more ex

HE IS NOW A
CHAPLAIN IN
REGULAR ARMY
Father McKinnon Is
Back Again.
â¦ â
WILL PROCEED TO MANILA
â¢
HE TELIiS ABOUT ARCHBISHOP
CHAPELLE'S MISSION.
Rev. Father William D. McKinnon ar
rived In the city yesterday aiter a. six
weeks' visit to Washington, D. C, and
other large Eastern cities. Father Mc-
Klnnon was recently appointed chaplain
of the regular army by the President and
has been ordered to proceed to Manila and
report to Commanding General Otis for
assignment to one of the regiments now
stationed in the Philippines. He will re
side with his mother at 1809 Stelner street
until the time for his departure, which
haa been fixed for December 10.
During his stay in Washington Father
McKinnon paid his respects to President
McKlnley, who asked him many questions
i regarding the prevalent conditions in the
islands. The reverend gentleman, who as
chaplain of the First California Volun
teers had acquired valuable information,
was enabled to enlighten the chief execu
tive on a variety of topics concerning af
: fairs in Manila. Father McKinnon also
met the members of the Philippine Com
mission, but unofficially, and he states
; that his conversation with them was not
iin the nature of testimony. He lectured
in various cities on subjects relating to
I the war in the Philippines and was greet
ed by large and enthusiastic audiences
I wherever he appeared.
Father McKlnnon's principal work was
in his association with Archbishop Cha
pelle, apostolic delegate to the Philip
â . pines, Cuba and Porto Kico. The Arch
bishop will arrive here on December 5
and will proceed to Manila on the same
transport with Father McKinnon. The
i latter in discussing the proposed mission
: of Archbishop Chapelle said:
"1 have no doubt that the efforts of
Archbishop Chapelle in the Philippines
; will ultimately result in bringing about
; pacific relations between the Filipinos and
the United States. His prime object, of
course, will be the settlement of church
affairs and the straightening out of in
ferences that have arisen between tne
friars and the Filipinos. This, I am pos
itive, will serve to establish a better reel
ing toward this nation.
"I was engaged with Archbishop Cha
pelle in arranging the preliminary work
for his mission, in fact, acting as his sec
retary, and I must say that he is a man
of rare tact and wonderful ability. His
success in a similar capacity in Cuba and
Porto Rico will undoubtedly be repeated
iin the far-off Philippines. He will have
; absolute authority in church matters, this
having been delegated to him by his
Holiness the Pope.
"He acquainted himself thoroughly with
the conditions as they exist in the Phil
ippines having consulted with the mem
bers of the commission on many points.
I communicated to him the result of my
observations there and he will be -well
; equipped to handle the situation. He
speaks Spanish fluently and is at present
â  mastering the intricacies of the native
â¢â  dialect. He was formerly pastor of one
of the leading churches in Washington,
D. C, and while there he renewed some
' of the friendships he had formed before
becoming Archbishop of New Orleans,
which exalted position he now holds."
In discussing the stories of the looting
of churches in the Philippines Father
McKinnon vehemently characterized
them as absolutely untrue.
"If there was any looting, said Chap
lain McKinnon, "it was not done by tae
American soldiers. Why, I would hold
â  myself personally responsible for .my
1 such reprehensible acts, because after
every battle I was instructed by the com
i manding general to select the guards I
! nf-eded to protect the churches. 1 picked
i out the best soldiers for the work I could
lind and we Invariably discovered that
' the looting and desecration had already
I been* accomplished by the insurgents
whom we had driven out. Whatever had
been left or overlooked by the insurgents
was stolen by the Chinese, who sold the
sacred articles for what they would
bring. I myself have purchased a num
ber from them. There may have been a
few individual cases of our soldiers who
appropriated articles, but I am certain
that they were very tew. Discipline in
that particular was rigid and a soldier
! who committed any such breach would
! have been shot. ,
"As far as associating the name of
General, then Colonel, Funston with
those practices, why, the charge has no
foundation Ln fact. I know General Fun-
Bton to be one of the bravest, cleverest
and most broad-minded of men. It Is do
ing a grave injustice to Funston, who has
done so much for his country. He nad
too many other things to attend to on
that memorable 7th of February to bother
himself about religious ornaments in
Caloocan church. It is a fact that this
church was occupied by the Insurgents
! from October 25, 1888, until the day it
was captured. I was one of the first to
enter the church and I saw nothing of
â¢ a religious character lying around. All
'â  the church ornaments had been removed
i long before by the Insurgents.
"As to the accusations against Captain
rnathy of the Third Artillery having
looted the church in Pasig 1 know posi
tlvely that he was never in Pasig. His
company was stationed all the time on
the northern line, while Paslg was on the
south. When Pasig was retaken by tha
Twentieth and Twenty-second regiments
Iwe found everything in the way of
i church ornaments boxed up, but the in
surgents had no time to remove their
plunder. In all cases I turned over the
property to the Archbishop of Manila.
Furthermore, not one of the churches
â¢was interfered with by our soldiers in
Manila, which was also stated in the pub
: lished reports. The daily devotions went
on uninterruptedly and not a single arti
cle was disturbed. I. consider the publi
i cation of 'he charges as unfortunate and
not borne out by the facts."

POISON IN THE
HASH SERVED TO
THE VOLUNTEERS
Fifty Privates Made
Deathly Sick.
BELONG TO FORTY-SECOND
SOLDIERS OF COMPANY X ABE
STRICKEN- WHILE AT DRILL.
Fifty privates of Company X of thÂ«
Forty-aecond Volunteer Infantry were the
victims of ptomaine poisoning yesterday
morning, and eighteen of them are now In
the General hospital at the Presidio slowly
recovering from the effects of their sud
den indisposition. The report which was
circulated through the camp of the regi
ment shortly after S o'clock that the en
tire company had been poisoned caused a
small panic, especially as it was strongly
intimated that some one had put polaon
In the men's food. This last rumor, how
ever, was soon known to be false, but the
fact remained that the boys of Company
X were very sick.
The first Intimation that there- was any
thing wrong came a few minutes after the
m< n had lined up for the morning drill,
n one of the privates suddenly
dropped his rifle and staggered from the
ranks, retching violently and evidently
suffering intense agony. Almost instantly
another rifle rattled to the ground and
then the whole company was apparently
! with convulsions. The soldiers
d from the ranks like drunken men,
look at their white, drawn faces
â¢ nough to show that they were suf
a something more serious than
Lulgence In spirituous liquors.
Surgeon Major McCall was hurriedly
summoned, and, assisted by the company
eded to treat the sufferers.
Idlers were found to be in
ous condition and they were
rushed off to the general hospital. They
were soon followed by fourteen others
â¢â¢ condition was but slightly less
is. The other thirty men were found
to be less .seriously affected and quickly
rallied after being- treated, although the
feeling of nausea did them for a
long time. Nearly every man in the com
pany showed symptoms of having eaten
something that did not agree with him.
Major McCall said yesterday afternoon
that the men were undoubtedly sufferli g
ptomaine poison, which was :
ably contained in the hash which formed
the morning meal. The cook of Company
X is regarded as the best In the regiment
and the company mess enjoys ii like repu
tation, so much so that the non-commis
sioned officers joined In it whenever
sible. The Ingredients for the hash had
been prepared by the cook on Friday af
ternoon, and consisted of fresh vege
aiM meat which had been
â  red during the afternoon. The
ingredients were not mixed to
gether until yesterday morning, in order
that there might be no danger of fermen
tation if the hash were allowed to stand
night. But although the hash was
noi mixed until morning, the fermenta
that had I â  ref ully guarded
t occurred nevertheless. Major
U is of tii- opinion that this may
hHve been one to the dampness and the
â¢â¢;;it there was no Ice in ramp for
the more perfect keeping of food stuffs.
However, there will be no more haÂ«h

wlnle that regiment remains at the Pre-
If poison had been placed in the food
â¢ n would have be-^n made sick al
â  after partaking, but no
symptoms of poisoning appeared until a
full hour after breakfast As soon as the
â  Ing was reported at army head
quarters General Shatter appointed a
board, consisting of Major A. C. Girard.
Burgeon, U. S. A.; Major P. F. Harvey,
surgeon, U. S. A., and Captain W. 6.
;, assistant surgeon. I. S. A., to
â¢ an Immediate investigation of the
r. The board met at 4 p. m. yester
day and will probably mafvft a forma!
r< port on -Monday. At 5 o'clock yester
day afternoon all the poisoned soldiers
were pronounced out of danger, but the
eighteejr most seriously affected are still
in the hospital
The provost guard of the Forty-sixth
Regiment has been doing good work
during thÂ« past two days rounding up
soldiers who had remained In town after
absence had expired
practically all the recalcitrants
were in camp hard at work drilling. Only
men are In the guardhouse, and
c says the report a of the
trouble have been greatly exaggerated-
He admits that a large "number of his
men, who received their pay on Monday
got drunk and failed to return to camp
until brought back by the provost guard
but he truly says that that failing Is
common among the men of all the regi
ments. A provosi pruard from the Forty
sixth was in town la.st night to gather in
any members of the regiment who might
take it into their heads to leave camp
without the formality of obtaining per
mission. Provost guards from several
r regiment? were also roaming about
town on a similar mission all day yester
day.
The parade and Inspection of the volun
teer- regiments at the Presidio by Gen
eral Miles, which was to have been held
yesterday, was postponed on account of
the weather until 10 a. m. Monday. This
will undoubtedly prevent the departure
of the Forty-sixth and Forty
fifth regiments on that day. as s he.lule'd
a' though they may be ordered aboard the
transports Monday afternoon. Orders
w< re issued yesterday directing that the
number of recruits to Bail on the Sen
ator be increased from twenty-five to
fifty. Second lieutenant Henry C. White,
Eleventh Volunteer Cavalry, will accom
pany them. In addition to Captain James
M. Arrasmith, Thirteenth Infantry.
Captain S. M. Foote will suil "on the
transport Benmohr to rejoin his battery
N of the Sixth Artillery, stationed at
Honolulu. Th* Renmohr'wlll also take a
detachment of twenty-two recruits for
the Sixth Artillery, at* Honolulu. At that
port the transport will take on board bat
teries A and H of the Sixth Artillery
which have been ordered to Manila.
Colonel Chark-s R. Greenleaf. assistant
surgeon general, has been ordered to thÂ»
Philippines. He will sail on the transport
Hancock. A number of surgeons and ns
sistant surgeons, together with a detach
ment of enlisted men of the hospital
corps, vill sail on the transports which
are to tiike the Forty-fifth and Forty
pixth regiments to the Philippines.
General Miles m;ide a formal call on
Generrl Bhafter yesterday morning, and

PLOT TO MURDER
Continued From Eleventh Pace.
tlngtiishing the fires kindled by the bom
bardment and savins much valuable prop
erty.
After the capture nnd occupation of the
city and suburbs, the troops at Iloilo saw
but little of the enemy, except in the way
â  t frequent outpost skirmishing, until
February 26, when a reconnoissance In
force v.ap made through Molo to the
town of Mandurraio, .some nine miles from
Iloilo, up in the foothills. The detach
ment, consisting of four companies under
ommand of Colonel Cnilders, who
had succeded Colonel Smith In command
of the regiment, found the enemy in
strong force and well posted just beyond
Mandurraio. These were soon driven
from their position and pursued for sev
eral miles by the handful of Tennes
seeans, losing some thirty killed and
many wounded. But as at Manila the Tf n
nesseeans escaped without the loss of a
man.
On March 16 they were again In battle,
assisting to repel a large body of the in
surgents who attacked the town of Jaro,
which was hold by five companies of the
Eighteenth Infantry. Four companies of
the First Tennessee under Colonel Chil
ders and Major Cheatham were sent to
their assistance. Crossing: the Jaro River
and coming in on the enemy's right flank,
they soon had them routed and running'
from the field, with a loss of lit) killed and
a proportionate number wounded. Again
the Tennessee boys came out unscathed.
Frequent short brushes with smaller
bodies of the enemy filled up the rest of
the time of their stay on Panay, but they
never again hud the satisfaction of having
any considerable body stand and make a
fight. The eagerness of the boys to fight
was shown by the incident which elicited
such warm praise from President Mc-
Kinlcy. The part of the regiment at Tloilo
had been taken on board the transport,
which then called at Oebu for the de
tachment Btationfed at that place. All
wore aboard and the vessel, which was
about to start for Manila on its way
home, when they learned that an expedi
tion was about to hv undertaken against a
large force of the insurgents strongly in
trenched in the mountains near El Pardo.
Their proffered services being accepted by
General Snyder, the whole regiment, dis
embarked and again took the neld. Tha
Insurgents were soon dislodged, two forts,
with several cannon and a number of in
trenched positions being taken. In his
cable report of the affair General Otis
pays: "The Insurgents overwhelmingly
defeated, Tennesseeans taking prominent
part." The work being finished, they le
turned to Cebu. re-embarked on the trans
port and started again for home, grudg
ing nothing of the extra duty which they
had assumed.
The regiment has been most fortunate
In the matter of casualties, having lost but
two men on the field, but up to the time
of nailing for home there had been
twenty-five deaths in Its ranka and ono
man killed by mistake, two-thirds of the
deaths occurring before it left the United
States and eight In the Philippines, in
cluding the cHaplaln, Captain l^ewis J.
LelaniT, who, with six of the men, Oied of
smallpox.
The men of the Tennessee Regiment
have received nothing but words of
prnise from their commanders and their
comrades. Besides General Otis and two
division commanders, they served under
the immediate command of four different
brigadier generals, and one and all have
officially given them the very highest
commendation as men and soldiers. The
Kansas boys and others with whom
they camped, and the Nebraskas, the
T'tahs, volunteers like themselves, as well
as the Fourteenth and Eighteenth Regu
lars, with whom they stood on battle line,
and all others who came in contact with
them, whether in camp or in the field,
have nothiiip but praise for the "Tennes
see boys." They have done and well done
| their full duty. They have won new
1 glory and honor not only for their own
State but for their whole section as well,
for the First Tennessee was the only
regiment from the South that went to the
Philippines and the only one from the
South that got Into the field of action be
fore the peace protocol was signed, and
the whole South shares with Tennessee
! the feeling of honest pride for the gallant
record of the First Tennessee Regiment.
The Tennessee Regiment mustered 1000
men and fifty-eight officers when it land
ed at Manila in December la.st. It num
] bered forty-three ofA.cers and 619 men
I when It boarded the transport to return
home. Major 13. F. Cheatham, with a
i number of line officers and 153 of the
men, remained In the Berviee of the
T'nited States and in the Philippines.
\ forming, with some additions from the
i Eighteenth Imantry, a battalion of one of
the new regiments commanded by Colonel
i R. B. Wallace, late of the Twentieth
: Kansas.

The Hay Market.
X.
The circular of Soott & Magner says:
â¢ "Receipts of Hay during the last six days
have been SOU tons. The market opened up
the first of the week fairly good, and on about .
thÂ« 6aiue lines as the end of last week. The
damaged Hay that still continues to arrive
sells slowly even -it extremely low figures.
There has also been more of the better grades
of dry Hay arriving, co that there Is enough
to fully supply the demand for such. k!ndÂ«>.
The continued ralna this we>.-k have nearly
stopped business In the handling of Hay. For
three days it has been lmpobsible to hare our
regular market sales. A large quantity of Hay
has, therefore, accumulated on tha trarks here,
as the rain has made it Impossible to handle
the Hay oft of the oars.
"ArrivaJs of Alfalfa Ray still oor.tinue to be
of those kind that have been damaged In the
bales or damaged in the stack. There haa been
no first-class dry Alfalfa Hay on the market
this week. Damaged Hay is selling very slowly
an.l at low figures. No. 1 Alfalfa Hay, dry,
will sell readily at top quotations.
"Straw has been In better demand this week
on account of the eicecdlnly light arrivals.
Considerable is Mpectivl in, but It has been
delayed on account of th rains. Therefore, the
market at present writing is firm at a little
advance over last week's figures."

EASTERN MARKETS
New York Stock Market.
JCBW YORK. Wot. 10.â To-day's bank state
ment proved rather worse than the moit ex
treme estimate had foretold. The loss In tht
cash reserves ran up to J5.217.4C0, whereas thÂ«
extreme estimate had been for only $4,500,000.
Some sanguine persons had hoped that the
cash loss would be offset by a loan contraction
as high as r.2. .000. Instead at that the de
crease In leans reached only $7,151,300. AÂ« this
only reduced the reserve requirements to the
extent of $2,7w>.500, the caah losiÂ«eÂ« have re
sulted in Increasing: the deficit below the legal
requirements of $i!, 755.&50. It was not to be
expected that so formidable an encroachment
on the already depleted reserves or the banks
should be without effect, and prices gave wa>
all around. The losses In the railroad list are
etrlkingly email, in spite of a large volume of
dealings. This department offered a stubborn
resistance to the pressure and there were evi
dently heavy buying orders to be executed. In
tha specialties, especially those recently active
In speculation, th losses were more severe. In
Eugar the Coalers, the local traction stocka,
eepeolally Manhattan, Tobacco and Tennessee
Coul there were wide breaches In prices. Even
in" these the bears were eager- to cover at the
decline and come eharp rallies were achieved.
As loans made on Friday on the Stock Ex
change carry over till Monday, the day's money
market was nominal. Liquidation was in an
ticipation of Monday's money market and was
not forced by actual calling of login. Tester
day's latf calling of loans Is probably not fully
reflected in the statement, bo that the actual
condition of the banks may be slightly better
than indicated, but the course of the money
movement makes the necessity of further loan
contraction a practical certainty. The foreign
exchange market, like the money market. Is al
most wholly nominal on Saturday, but the
nominal rates for sterling were marked down
en additional half cent.
Traders In stocks generally seek to anticipate
t
a certain amount of outside buying which
comes Into the market after an election, owing
to the relief from the unsettling Influences on
business of a political campaign. There- was
isional buying of stocks on Monday with
this object and a resulting advance in prices.
There was also some outside demand on
Wednesda- as was expected. But it proved in
sufficient to absorb the offerings. The large
buying by the bear element during the previous
week had resulted In eliminating much of the
short Interest from the market and Its techni
cal position was thereby weakened. The course
of events In the money market demonstrated
that the hopes of a relaxation during the pre
vious wee* had been illusive. New York ex
change, which had hardened at various points
and at Chicago, had risen to 10 cents premium
I per 1000, eased off again in the latter instance
to a discount.
The activity of trade is making extraordinary
uses for money in all the countries of Europe
and In England, and in England this need is
aggravated by the war expenditures and the
cutting oft of the Transvaal gold supply, so
that a withdrawal of this country's credits
would have a widely unsettling effect on foreign
financial markets, with an effect on our own
market. For this reason the calling home of
credits is considered undesirable. But it Is the
conviction that in the event <>f any actual dis
tress for money In the country the world would
! have to pay its debts to us. The active and
I profitable use of money in trade even to the
exclusion of speculation on credit, is not felt
to constitute a threat to real values, even of
stocks and securities, but so long as expansion
continues in the country's use for money and
the Sub-Treasury continues to make demands
on the New York banks, it is evident that the
banks must continue to call loans to meet the
encroachments on their reserves, while the re
serves continue near the border of legal re
quirements. Stocks held with borrowed mone>
are thus reed to sale and fall into the hands
<j* those who have money in hand without the
need to borrow.
Bonds have moved slightly in sympathy with
slocks, but changes have been narrower.

Associated Banks' Statement.
NEW YORK, Nov. 11.â The Financier says:
"The Associated Banks of New York City
are now $2,788,960 below the required 26 per
cent reserve. The week's operations, as dis
closed by the statement of Nevember 11. show
th.it the decrease of cash was $5,217,400, of
which loss $3,386,900 was in the form of specie
and $1,830,600 in legal tenders. Deposit contrac
tion : eve requirements only about
two and three-fourths millions, so that half
the cash loss came out of the reserve on hand.
atement J..es not differ much from what
haJ been expected. The banks in their week's
operation with the treasury were debtors to
an amount approximately three millions and
the Interior took nearly, or yuite, two million*
additional. In the face of a temporary spurt
in the. stock market transactions the â ;
of $1,151,100 In loans is interesting. The loan
item has shrunk since the opening of July
about $105.(A>o,000 and now stands at about the
same point reached at this time last year. In
i other words, the banks have lost in loans
all that they had previously gained as the re
sult of twelve months' active business. They
n the other hand, getting a higher rate
on their present commitments. It Is difficult
â¢ future operations, but khe very
lack of money In New York now must bring
â¢ b â¢n. The Inter:
iked to to supply the usual fall r
If! ment, but as yet there ar-^ no signs of aid
in this quarter. Specie Imports are not Im
probable, with exchange tailing. The third
Ltive Is advice from the treasury which
an al m rblng heavily from the banks all
B immer. Washington officials suy that they
It present no Intention to furnish funds
to banks through public bond purchases and
the. only remaining form of relief, if indeed
relief be needed, in to allow Internal revenue
to remain on deposit with the bank do
rlea, The situation, however, is not to
garded as critical for the simple reason
that the present conditions are due more to the
iperity than anything else. The
demands ol business in all quarters have
it ;L-ht to bear on New Y^rk a pressure for
that is unprecedented. This money,
aside from what the treasury has taken, Is
not being hrÂ»arded. It is In active use some
whore, and in the course of time will return
to Its logical center. Just now Its absence Is
severely felt. Were It not for excess In the
treasury payments at New York It is not
probable that there would be much of a strin
gency at any point."

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAOO. Nov. 11.â The story of wheat to
day wan one of continuous liquidation based on
the bearish tone of statistics. The down
heartened bulls let their holdings slide In a
despondent stream. The decline wns In spite
of Liverpool. The openlsg was a shade lower
at 67*<3'67*fee for December and May at 7!Vi'3!
71% C, This was the highest price of the day.
Receipts in the Northwest werÂ» liberal and theiv
was a prospect of an increase in the visible
of 2,000.000 bushels, and In local stocks of
1.000,000. The cash demand was small. Witii
this array of figures as an Impulse, the market
eased off from the opening, going %o under I
puts. December to 67% c and May to 710. There j
was a momentary rally of a shade on buying I
against puts, but it was merely a straw in j
the downward rush. At the close there was j
continued buying against puts and some cov
ering by shorts, which put closing figures at
67\Â»c for December and 71% c for May. The
market was dull and a belief that the price
would sink still more Monday, when statistics
are expected to be bearish.
Corn stubbornly opposed traveling parallel
with wheat. In this it was assisted by the
statistics. There was a report of damage from
frosts and dry weather in Argentine, and Liver- |
pool was firm. There was a difference of opin- |
lon concerning country offerings, but a major- i
ity apparently held that they were still small :
and not increasing. December closed at 31Vi@
31% c; May at 32%@32%c.
There was quite a good trade in oats, the
selling of May by professionals and commission
peopls being the feature. The â  demand was
sufficient to consume the offerings. December
closed at 22%522%c: May, 23Â«i@23%0.
Provisions were a dull market and the price
tended downward. January pork closed 7%c
lower, January lard 2%0 lower and January
ribs 6<3 lower.

Harrison's circular says: "During the week
there have been thÂ« following deliveries of
coai, vis.: two from Washington. 7500 tons;
four from British Columbia, 8038 tons; one
from Australia. 2304 tons; total. 17.542 tons.
If double this amount had arrived there would
have been an Immediate outlet for It. Judging
from the lines of teams awaiting their loads
from recent arrivals from the north. Our late
rain storms have largely Increased the demand
for household fuel, which Is In very light stock
here at present. The steamers -*-hlch are coal
carriers on the coast are beating records In
making their round trips, as they are loaded
and discharged at an average of over 1000 tons
per day. Prices generally have not been dis
turbed for domestic grades, and steam coals
have advanced but little.
"Coal freights from ail foreign sources have
been marked up, aa tonnage Is scarce every
where. This must lead to better prices ruling
later on. Honolulu is still In the market for
fuel from Australia and British Columbia. This
trade Is diverting a large majority of our coal
carrying sailing ve-sets from their regular ports
and causes a temporary scarcity here. Our
seasonal rainfall to date will cause our ship
owners to head their vessels In this direction
later on."

HOW!
CONDUCTED
DIVINE SERVICE
ON THE
FIRING LINE
AT MANILA
Â£"" T'VO serve Christ at the front In war Is
\ somewhat different from occupying
a pulpit in civilization.
There ia little in. battle that could
JL â be said to have a christianizing In
fluence upon the Individual. .
What' ver Is accomplished In this line
must be done through sheer persistence.
iho flring'line it fs scarcely wise to KM
the resiment at any given point
bhould bo Bred uy*>ar yet â  â  mem
or'.fv. of cur sermons under tire are recol
lections which .time can never dim.
Thrbugh persistence find bullets w*
â¢a able to conduct perhaps the most
â¢xtraordii./iry services yet recorded.
r my i ..: ment- I- endeavored to
Y</.-\ gospel services. â whenever a few could
:ojivtne<lâ many times ever. , In thÂ«
trenches and some-times when the insur
gents were actually keeping up a desul
tory lire on our- line.
f course such ser'vlc<*Â» were entirely
Informal, for at different times the bullets
fr m the enemy's gur.a dropped pretty
dose to us.
Uut we have held ;iÂ» many, as Â»evÂ«n of
these during one Sabbath day and torn*
i:; â  .; had a congregation of thirty.
In the first place, my environment* wÂ«re
Â«o changed arid my duties so altered my
actions took on the. color of my surround
ings; my thoughts flowed in other chaa
r> . --â¢. ray whole nature; to ba pf use to my
Master, had to undergo a radical change,
which left me more a. man of action than
of theory. .- â¢
I lived with the soldiers and waa one vt
them When they were overworked or
overc c by th<- h'-at â it -was my duty
to rest them by standing- guard. tlomlllM
would have weakened rather than
â trengthened my influence. 1 etrovo to
teach by constant example' in my daily
<- â¢ rishlp with my' fallows. At a
Â»â¢ n pathizer and a sharer with them In
t: r dangers and trials It was that I
could appeal most strongly. .
Instead of thi clerical habit which cus
tom has decreed as the parb of the clergy
man I donned the uniform of the soldierâ
the pistol In my belt In strong conlraat tÂ«
the Bible In my saddlebags.
I can tell you about how. we were sltu
atÂ«'f'. uni v.-liat we did on such occasions.
Our r^chnont was holdlr.jr a line of ln
tren'cl rr:r!:ts about a mile and a half
long, with ten companies equally dividing
the distance. Two companies were held
In ManUa to .truard General Otis" quarters,
and th'.-sf were cl^anged with those- on thÂ«
line, so that *-ach company, got to the city
â¢.bout every ton deys.
It was not an e.-usy matter to g^t a con
irrocation. because there n.ro always du
ties f'>r soldiers to perform. They work
In reliefs; to be sure, but there Is policing
of quartors, cleaning of srras and cloth-
Inp. details for guard duty, orderlies for
generals and commanding officers, and
many things to be done, which, together
With tbi regular end unexpected duties,
keep the men quiU: busy, ev<?n when In
quarters. Yet in the face of the greatest
difficulty and gravest dangers, with the
crack of the enemy's rifles In our ira and
the "ping-" cif their bullets as they whls
tied byâ even th>-rp, the :i.ame of Christ
was powerful enough to ho!d the attention
of our weary and footsore soldiers.
Every day I visited some portions of the
lliK?, If' not nil of the companies, and I
â¢.Iway? carried with me â on the back of
my faithful pony Billyâ writing paper, en
velopes and all of the reading matter I
could secure. (lathering the outgoing mail
and stumping it. .soldiers' it-ttors, and de
livering on tho liring line any that came.
On Sunday, besldps these, 1 carried sever
al copies of gospel hymns in my haver-
Back, and usually introdufÂ«d the nubject
cf services by saying, "Weil, boysâ this is
Bunday. Shall we have a little sing to
gether?" The boys entered heartily into
the singing, and I often wondered what
the insurgents thought of such proceed
â¢ Ing 3in the midst of war. For we were
not at all diffident about making a noise,
and we mado the welkin ring.
But the scene would have been Interest
ing, Indeed, to an onlooker from home.
Here were the boys, scattered about, some
â¢tanding. others sitting on the grass In
the shade of a bush or tree, or under their
â¢helter tents, or lying in the trenches, or
looking out over them, with guns by their
aides and ready to usÂ« at an instant's
warning. The chaplain, standing among

Bang the louder.
We were quite fond of Binding "Glory to
His Name." "When the Roll Is Called Up
Yonder," "Onward Christian Her," and
others of the more familiJir gospel hymns.
But our doxolog y was always "America."
I think, however, that the favorite song
was "When the Roll Is Called Up Yon
der." The boys fully appreciated Its sad
significance. Each Sunday some of their
brave comrades had answered that higher
roll call.
"When the roll Is called up yonder, I'll
be there," rang out from their lusty
throats, and frequently the sound was
augmented by the hissing Mausers that
beat upon the ground about us.
At such times some of our boys uttered
remarks not Intended as an adjunct to
religious ceremonies.
I was thrilled with the intensity of the
hour and filled with a spirit that never
possessed me while preaching from our
modern pulpits.

was' "Thou wilt keep him In the perfect
peace whose mind is staid In thee, because
he trusteth In the*-."â lsaiah, xxvi:3.
Staying qualities, obedience, faithful
ness, trust or confidence, alike essential to
the soldier as the Christian, were Borne
of the lessons that I strove to Inculcate
in the minds of my hearers.
Though In the midst of the stern and
harsh realities of war, these little ser
mons were oases to us.
Here we stopped for a few moments to
think of the dear ones at home, of God
and his love, and our duty to both,- and I
know we were made stronger; better, by
them.
We will realize this more as the years
pass. My diary shows the number of
services held In the trenches for eight
consecutive Sundays, as follows; First, 4
services; second, 2; third, 6; fourth, 2;
fifth, 7;_Bixth,J; seventh., 2; eighth, 4. and

Two or three Sundays we had constant
fighting or marching, so that none could
be held. Other Sabbaths we held as many
as conditions would allow.
Whenever and wherever we met we
knew that many prayers were being of

were n< ver to be forgotten days. The plc

for who ran comprehend what that terri

â a it poured In upon our reg-lment? Whlla
deployed as skirmishers it marched coolly
and with military precision across the
wide plain from Maycanayan into the
very Jaws of death.
And then with superhuman strength
made its heroic rushes across the rice
patties until within that range where the
Springfield could do execution. Those few
moments seemed hours. The fire from
the enemy was terrible. They had found
our range. They were shooting low.
Durintr this engagement and la all oth

splendid service.
They were on. the firing line continu

heartrending the scenes they witnessed;
and our boysâ oh, they are grand sol

battle. They forded streams, marched in
Intense heat, fighting: the enemy at every
move. The dead and dying Americans
and Filipinos were continually In our
midst. In the battles I, was everywhere
on the field seeking the wounded and car

thick and faÂ»t. but Qo4 wonderfully cared
for and protected me. It was my mission
to listen to tender farewells and bear last
messages to heartbroken mothers.
When our adjutant fell mortally
wounded, I was at his Bide soon enough
for him to know me. He seemed so iflad
when I said to him, "My dear boy. this

were on the advance to Malolos we could
not bury our own dead, but Chaplain C.
C. Price of the regular army had the care
of those who fell on the field; for all were
taken to Manila by train for burial. But
before? this we attended to these sad rites,
our band always furnishing music, with
the command of the deceased In attend

Our services were simple but Impres

was furnished and a neat black clotn
covered coffin, over which was laid the
fat;. On several instances the command

afterward placed a neat headstone at the
grave. One of our burials occurred In the

In the Philippines.
THE now American Sultan of the
Bulu arcj.,pelaKo, in the Philippine*,
Is said to have a pillow case full of
pearla, which he keeps carefully
guarded In one of his big Iron
chests. Whether this Is true or not
no white man knows, but It has been one
of the laws of the Moros for centuries
that all big pearls go as tribute to the
Sultan, as well as one-fourth of all the
finds mini' by his subjects. So the Sultan's
pearl revenue has in the past been a very
substantial one, and there Is every reason
to believe that during his rei.^' he has
owned enough pearls to nil several old
pillow slips 'f h" pn desired.
There ma be millions for Americans In
the pea shell fisheries of our new pospes-
Bior.s when the complete pacification ot
the bloodthirsty, warlike Muro comes to
pass. Neither exocrts nor laymen,, nor
even the Moros themselves, are familiar
with th" extent of the pearl shell bankj
alonpr the hundred or more small islands
of the southern port) of the Philippines.
That they are scattered over a largi terri
tory is testified to by the natives, who sell
Â«mal! quantities of shell and many pearls
to Borneo and Chinese tni.Ws. That som*
banks an very extensive lias been well
determined by the rich Chinese merchant,
Capain Tiana, of Jolo, who has for eight
years held the exclusive concession from
the Sultan to fish for pearls by means of
diving suits In the Sulu archipelago.
A commercial man will naturally auk
why the beds have not been worked, If
they represent such â  submarine mine of
wealth, to a greater extent in the past.
The, answer is apparently a simple cneâ
because nohnrlv h;is dnrer!
The sovereignty of the islands was os
tensibly Spain's; the real sovereign was
the Sultan. To make pearl i.shlng pos
sible for foreigners or Spanish subject*,
It would have required a double conces
sion and boats armed with Gatltng guns.
Spain would not give foreigners who had
the daring to Bah concessions, because,
"dog in the manger" as she was, she
feared to lose a good thing she could not
herself develop. She dared not work them
herself or give concessions to Spanish
subjects, as that would have provoked a
war with the Sultan, who claimed the

would never trust himself on a long voy
age in such a craft.
The crew were Tagalogs and Morn?.
The divers were L'agalos, both pinched
faced, hollow cheeked fellows, who looked
as if their lives were being squeezed out
of then by inches. Such Is literally the
truth. For ten years of comparative afflu
ence, at the enormous salary the
Bast ot sixty pesos, or $30, a month,
they forfeit their chance of a longer life
and undergo, it is said, the most fright
ful torture day by day in a watery,
close-fitting mold, which crushes the
life blood back upon the struggling heart.
Twenty-five fathoms under water, in a
rubber diving suit; with only the head
protected from the grinding pressure of
the ocean's grasp by a copper helmet
THE PTTNPAT CALIi.
Even yet the significance of this state
ment is not felt, until it is said that these
men work at the wonderful depths of a
hundred and forty to a hundred and
sixty feet, for ten or fifteen minutes at
a time, under the most overpowering
weight of water, exerting a pressure of
from sixty to seventy pounds upon every
square Inch of their flesh. The craving
of the human heart for wealth Is amaz
ing! '
Not only do these divers, in their
nfty-pound copper shoes, which hold
them to the bottom, go down, through
green depths Riled with the monsters of
a tiopical sea, confronting daily the
danger of Immense fish making direct at
tack or appropriating their air tubes for
bait, but they walk along an uneven
ocean floor for hundreds of yardsâ a floor
overgrown with enormous coral groves,
in whose shadows lurks the giant devil
fish with his outspreading tentacles from
whose embrace it is well nigh impossible
for pigmy man to escape.
The boat comes to anchor and the diver
begins his initial preparation for a
descent by rimming a thick red blanket,
which encasi s his whole body in its eoft
folds. A great bag comes next, with
arms and legs to it. open only at the neck
where the heavy brass collar plate sup
ports the helmet, and at the rubber wrist
lets, through which the hards are pain
fully thrust. It is no easy task to get
Into a heavy, unwieldy sack of this kind,
made of alternate thicknesses of canvas
and pure red rubber, and two men work
â¢Â«a tupsle to get thl* muffled object of
red flannel shaken down Inside. At iast
he Is In, and the hands are squeezed
through constricting rubber ring* ut f he
wrists, which hermetically seal th.mt
selves on the soft il^sh, but over which,
as a further precaution, are snapped
heavy rubber band?.
Perspiration begins to pour down the
diver's face and trickle Into his eves as
; :i.- assistants strut rle again with the gro
tesque metal shoes, much like a large pair
of Dutch wooden shoes. Now the metal
neckyoke is slipped over his head, with its
encircling row of perpendicular bolts
which are sin ed through the holes h

be called an artistic ruffle, this throat en

suit makes a water-tight joint between
tiie two metal rings.
The. front bull's eye of plate glass la left

equipped with a dorded basket for Bhells

work on a Rood bank of shells, bring up
a dozen or even more at a trip, but a
hundred shells a day is excellent work
and a mint of money. On this exhibition
trip, over barren ground, he had but a
single fair sized shell, some six inches In
diameter, and half a dozen of the curious
spiny star fish of these waters.
A big shell, whose Inside nacre la beauti
ful even in its unpolished condition, will
measure a foot in diameter, though the
majority of the shells do not average six
or seven inches.
The price of pearl shells, which weigh
several pounds apiece, fluctuate between
30 and 60 cents a pound, depending: not so
much upon demand, which Is always
above supply, as on size, luster and color;
but it will be seen that with a crew of six
men, who receive ?10 â ; month and cheap
rice for food, a diver at $60, and a man
afi.er for all the ten boats at $100 a month
the enterprise is a money making one It
should be remembered thai these prices
are Eastern silver ones, or Mexican dol
lars at 50 cents piece.
The precious pearl is not found in every
shell; and not very often in a hundred
shells Its pursuit Ie a game of change
entirely. Now and then great finds r,re
made, and again during a whole month
I'm a dozen of the milk white drops help

immense pearls found in MOl waters
pearls which bring $10,000 after polishing
by native hands. The average fine large
pearl of perfect color, and they are very
rare, does not bring much above 2500
pesos, while but 10 per cent of the finds
bring over 250. The other 899-10 per cent
grade Into large pearls of bad shape or
color, smaller pearls of perfect shape, but
off the pearl white tint, and hundreds of
tiny fellows, good, bad and worthless.
There arc numbers of yellow pearls
which are quite as handsome as the
lighter colors, but on the open market
they bring poor prices, as yellow pearls
are not the fad. The black" pearl found
in another shell is much in demand, but
the mollusk its, is rare.
The oearls which Tiana secures far
more than pay the entire running ex
penses of his boats and the hanging and
shipping of the shells to Singapore.
Pearls are doubtless lost now and then
by theft, but in view of the fact that each
boat has a crew who watch the opening of
the shells with the greatest Interest, and
thai where pearls are found they have to
be carefully cut from the meat of the moi
lus.k, it is difficult for a single individual
to cause them to disappear. The China-,

They are wondrnul judges of the worth
of pearls, estimating by the eye and touch
within a few dollars of a large specimen.
Native Moro divers are far more Inter

down to greater depths. Stories are told
of how naked natives swim down a sheer

there five minutes and finally come up

Such tales are gross exaggerations, hut

One of San Francisco's millionaire
bachelors prefers books to young ladies.
He has 13,000 of the former. Ten thou
sand of these are law books that line the
walls of his Nevada Mock offices with
buff and scarlet. "I don't know anything
about them except that they're here,"
Mr. Lloyd said. "Ask that young man;
he's the one that knows."
Mr. Lloyd retired once more to the

He Is, however, a very up-to-date ghost.
"The law library is rare only because
of Its numbers," said the proxy. "It is
merely an extra big collection of law

books here, too."
The library that Mr. Lloyd himself
wades In Is in the Folsom street house.
It is made up of voyages and travels,
Californlan literature. Persian and Indian
history. He has a tasie for queer vol
umes as well as curios. There is an illus
trated volume upon the Queen's Balmoral
home. There is an early work on 1 psy
chology. Perched upon "his shelves are
queer carved things that leer. Mr. Lloyd
is not conventional in his collecting.
Mr. A. P. Hotalingr's library is made
up of 6000 miscellaneous works. There
are novels and poems and scientific works
and reference books, like Mr. Buck

Chief Leesâ lsaiah Lees to those who
know him outside of his professionâ lives
up on the Pine-street hill with lO.fiOO
books. "Voyages are just as much my

he was only safe when I could pull the

There is one curious library in town
which is largely made up of works on
grapes and wines. It belongs to Arpad
Haraszthy, and is apropos of his busi

about wine-making," said one of hi 9
friends. "He even studies the classical
side of his work, and knows the whole

wine was Invented s.ime time before
telephones or even printing. Haraszthy
thinks that the making of It was In

But his literary tastes do not stop at
wine history. He has travels and philo

But now the roar of cheering and the
blare of martial music had reached the
very gateway. The broad portal? were
thrown open and, In blue and brown,
crushed and squeezed by the attendant
throng, the head of the column of in
fantry came striding on to the pier. The
band, wheeling: to one side, stood at the
entrance, playing leas in, the rafters
ringing to the stirring strains of "The
Liberty Bell." They were still far down
the long pier, the sloping rifles just visi
ble, dancing over the heads of the crowd.
No time was to l" lost. More tables were
to be carried, butâ who but thatâ 'that
little army woman" could give the order
bo that it would be obeyed? Not one bit
did the president like to do It. but some
thing had to be done to obtain the neces
sary order, for the soldiers who so will
ingly and promptly obeyed her beck and
call were now edging away for a look at
the newcomers, and Mrs. Frank Garrison,
perched on the carriage step and chatting
most vivaciously with its occupants and
no longer concerning herself, apparently,
about the Red Cross or its tables, had the
gratification of finding herself approached
quite as she had planned, by two most
prominent and distinguished women of

that minute half a dozen boys in blue were

on the crowded side of the dock, and
others still were bearing oil stoves, urns
and trays. In less time, than it takes to
tell it the entire Red Cross equipage was
on its way across the pier, and when the
commanding officer of the arriving regi

planned to occupy with his band, his staff
and all his leers, there in state and

under the young' soldier's mustache. The
colonel pan.- oil one moment, shook his
head find concluded ho, too, would better
grin and bear It. Taking the paper in his
hand again he heard his name called and
paw smiling faces and beckoning hands In
an open carriage near him, but the sight
of Stanley Armstrong signaling to him
from another, farther away, had some
thing dominant about it. "With you In a

summoned him. "What is it, Arm

"I wish to present you to some friends

CHAPTER VII.
Billy Gray was indeed In close arrest
and the grim prophecy was [gdflUea^
Colonel Canker was proving an> thing
but a guardan angel to him The whole
regiment, officers and men. barring on y
the commander. was practically in
mourning with sorrow for him and chag
rin over Its own discomfiture. Not orii>
one important prisoner was gone, but
two: not only two. but four. No man in
authority was able to say just when or
how it happened: for it was Canker s own
order that the prisoners should not oo
paraded when the guard fell in at night.
â [â¢ , v were there at tattoo ano at taps
"all secure." The officer of the guard,
said several soldiers, had quite a long
talk with one of the prisoner?- young
Mortonâ just after tattoo, at which time
the entire guard had been inspected by
the commanding; officer himself. But at
reveille four most important prisoners
were gone and, such was Canker's wrath.
not only was Gray In arrest, but the
sergeant of the guard also, while trio
three luckless men who were successively
posted as sentries during the night at the
back of the wooden shell that served as
a guardhouse- were now in close confine
ment in the place of the escaped quartet.
Yet those three were men who had hith- -
erto been above suspicion, and there were
few soldiers in the regiment who would
accept the theory that any one of the
three had connived at the escape. As for
the sergeantâ had served four enlist
ments in the teenth. and without a
flaw in his record beyond an . occasional
aberration In the now distant past, due
to the potency of the poteen distilled by
certain Hibernian experts not far from
an old-time "plains fort," where the regi
mont had rested on its march 'cross con
tinent. A? for the officersâ but who would
suppose an officer guilty of anything of
the kindâ a flagrant military crime? And
yetâ men got to asking each other if it
were so that Bugler Curran had carried a
note from the prisoner, Morton to Mr
Gray about 2:30 that afternoon? And
what was this about Gray's having urged
Brooke to swap tours with him an hour
later, and what was that story the head
quarters clerks were tfllir.g about Mr
Gray's coming to the adjutant and ber
glng to be allowed to "march on" that
evening instead of Brooke?. It wasn t
lonp before these rumors, somehow rot
to Canker's ear. and Canker seemed to
gmv: as big again; he fairly swelled w'th
indignation at thought of such ttirDi*
tude on the part of an officer. ThÂ»n ne
sent for Gray-it was the afternoon tol
lowing the sailing of the ships with the
big: brigadeâ and with pain and bewilder
ment and Indignation in his brave blue
eyes the youngster came and stood before
his stern superior. Gordon, who sent the
message, and who had heard Canker's de
nunciatory remarks, had found time to
scribble a word or two-"Admit nothing
say nothing; do nothing but hold your
tongue and temper. If C. insists on in
sv.ers say you decline except in presrnc"
of your legal advftcr." So th^re was a
scene in the commander's tent that after-
i The morning had not been without its
Joys Along about 10 o'clock as Gray Bat
writing to his father in his little canva*
home, he heard a voice that sent he blood
leaping through his veins and filled his
eyes with .light. Springing from liis ca-xm
stool 1 and capsizing it as he did so he
poked his curly head from the entrant-!
of the tent-and there she was-^nly a
dozen feet away-Major Lane in cour 'ecus
attendance, Mr. Prime sadly followt - n
and Miss Prime quite content with the de
votions of Captain Schuvler. Only Â»

him with frank smiles and sympathy n

poor Billy never heard , or cared what 'the
others said, so absorbed was he in drink
. Ing in her gentle words and gazing Into
her soft, dark eyes.
No wonder he found it difficult to re
lease her hand. That brief visit, tilled
with sweetness and sunshine, ought to
have been a blessing to him all day long,
but Canker caught sighi of the damsels
as they walked away on the arms of the
attendant .cavaliersâ Lawrence. more
than once smiling: back at the incarcer
ated Billyâ Canker demanded to be
informed who they were and where they
had been, and Gordon answered they were
Miss Lawrence of Santa Anita find rMiss;
I'rimf.- of New Yorkâ and he "reckoned",
they must have been in to condole wirli'
Mr. Grayâ whereat Canker snarled that
people ought to know better than .to' visit
officers in arrestâ it was tantamount to
disrespect to the commander, was
marvelous how- many things :n Canker a
eves were disrespectful; â¢
So he heard these stories with eager
ears and sent for Gray, and thought to
bully him Into an Admission ozJeonfeasion,
but ' Gordon's words had -stiffened the
little fellow to the extenfcsoi braving (.-an
ker's anger and telling him he had said
all he proposed to say when the colonel
called him up the previous day. Ihe-re
sult of that previous interview .was h?s
being placed in dose arrest and informed
that he should be tried by genera! ourt
inartia! at once. So he had taken
as was his right, and "counsel foiuade

"Then you refuse to divulge the con

But there were other things that might

contemplated them with sinking heart.
Taking prompt advantage of his position
as officer of the guard, he had caused the
voting prisoner to be brought " , l?l
the guardhouse, and as a heavy, dripping
fog had come on the wings of the night
wind, sailing in from the sea, he had led
the way to the sheltered side, which hap
pened to be the darkest one, of the rude
-little building, and had there bidden him
tell his story. But Morton glanced un
easily at a sentry who followed close and
was hovering suspiciously about . _â¢'! can
not talk aboutâ the affairâ that fel
low spying," be said, with an eager plea
in his tone and a sign of the hand- that
Gray well knew and quickly recognized.
â¢â¢Keep around in front. I'll be respon
sible for this prisoner." -were his orders,
and. almost reluctantly, the man left.
He was a veteran soldier, and his man
ner impressed the lieutenants with a
vague sense of trouble. Twice the sentry
glanced back and hesitated, as though
something were on his mind that he must
tell but finally he disappeared and kept
out of the -way during the brief Inter
view that immediately followed. . The
prisoner eagerly, excitedly began his ex
planationâswiftly banishing any linger
ing doubts Gray might have .entertained
as to his innocence. But he had com*
from a stove-heated guardroom into the
cold sea wind off the Pacificâ into the
floating wisps of .vapor thai sent chill to
the arrow. He was far too lightly, clad
for that climate, and presently he began
to shiver. â¢ â 
"You are cold," Raid Gray, pityingly.
"Have you no overcoat?"
"It's at my tentâ l never expected to
spend this night here. I've been before the
summary court, fined for absence, and
thought" that would end it, but instead
of that I'm a prisoner and the- man who
should be here is stalking about -camp,
planning more robberies. ; Yet I'd rather
associate with the very worst of the-de
serters or dead beats inside there,'-' and
the dark eyes glanced almost in horrorâ
the slender figure shook with mingled re
pulsion and chillâ "than with -that
smooth-tongued sneak and liar: There s
no crime too mean for him to commit,
Mr. Gray, and the men are beginning to
know it, though the colonel won't. For
God's sake, get me out. .of this before
morning" And again the violent
tremor shook the lad from he- to foot.
"Hereâ get inside!" said Gray impul
sively. "I'll see the adjutant at once, .and
return to you in a few minutes. 'If/you

"It would be â " vehemently interrupted
Morton, then breaking .off .short, as
though at loss for descriptivem-ss of

â with passion as he clinched his fists and
fairly stood upon hi= tors an instant; his
Btrong white teeth grinding together. "It
â¢would beâ simply he!H" he burst in again,
hoarse and quivering. "It -would ruinâ
everything. Can't the general give the
order to-night?" he asked with intense
eagerness, while the young officer, taking
him by the arm. had led' him again to the
light of the gi;ardhou'se lamps at the
front. The servant and a group of" sol
diers straightened up 'and faced-- them,
listening curiously.
"It may be even impossible to- see the
general."" answered ray doubtfully.
"Take Morton into the guardroom till I get
back, sergeant, and let him wu.rm himself
thoroughly. Don't put him with the- pris
oners till I return." and so"' saying lie had
hastened away. Gordon., his friend and
adviser, had left ramp and gone visiting

the innocence of the accused soldier. Gray
knew ii was useless to appeal to the col

of the lad for immediate release. Another

What could be the reason â it was not
that, though innocent of the robbery of
the storehouse, or of complicity in the
pale of stolen ponds, some other crime lay
at his door which the morrow might dis
close? All the loyalty of a Delta Sip was
stretched to the snapping point as Gray
raused irresolute in front of the adjutant's
tent, his quest there unsuccessful. The
sergeant major and a sorely badgered
clerk were working late over some regi
mentaJ papersâ things that Morton wrote
out easily and accurately.
"I suppose, sir, it's no use ask - to
have the prisoner sent up here under
guard," said that jewel of a non-commis
sioned officer. "Yet the colonel will be
savage if these papers ain't ready. It will
take us all night as things are going."
Gray shook his curly head. "Go ask. if
you like, but â Morton's in no shape to
help you"
"Has he been drinking, sir?" said the
sergeant-major In surprise. "I never
knt-w him"
"Oh. it isn't that," said Gray hastily,
"only he's â he's other matters on his
mind. Brir.g me his overcoat. He said
it was In his tent," and the young officer
Jerked his head at the patch of little
"A" tents lined up in the rear of those
of the officers.
"Get Morton's overcoat and take it to
him at the guardhouse." snapped the staff
sergeant to the e'erk. "Be spry now. and
no stopping on the way hack," he added,
well aware how much in need his as
sistant stood of creature comfort of some
surreptitious and forbidden kind". The
man was back in a moment, the coat.
rolled on his arm.
"I'll take it," said Gray simply; "you
needn't come." " â¢ .
"Go on with It!" ordered the sergeant as
the soldier hesitated. D'ye think the
service has gone to the devil and officers
are rrrnnin' errands for enlisted men? An*
get back inside two minutes, too," he
added with portent in his tone. The sub
altern of hardly two months' service felt
the implied rebuke of the soldier of over
twenty i years and meekly accepted the
amendment, butâ a thought occurred to
him: He had promised Morton paper en
velopes and tamp* and the day's news
papersâthe lad seemed strangely eager to
pet all the latter? and vaguely Billy re
membered havlug heard that Canker con
sidered giving papers to prisoners us

"Take it by way of my tent," said he as
they started, and once there it took time*
to find things "Go back to the sergeirit

"Mammon & C 0.." by E. F. Benson, the
author of "Dodo," is a novel of the
"smart" sot in London society and of
the high finance which uses the smart
fiet for advertising purposes. Mr.
AUngton was a financier, a floater
of Australian mines. He was a large
man, with a look in repose of heavy
respectability, like a butler, in animation
usually of serene benignity, like a hlunt
featured saint. His hair was rather thin
and light, with a bald spot In It like a
tonsure. "Sobrietj shone from his large,
mild eye and the lines of his firm, some
what full-lipped mouth expieesed steadi
ness in every curve." About his room
hung a few exquisite pictures. His tastes
In eating and drinking were dainty almost
to asceticism. He would stop a conver
sation on the most engrossing financial
topics to call attention to the beautiful
line drawn across the sky by a flight of
birds, or to the serene charm of the even
ing light on the hills. When he had with
absorbed attention worked out the details
of a great money deal, h^ would rest him
self by playing Bach's St. Matthew Pas
sion music, alternating from vibrant pas
sion to the most delicate reticence and
sobriety with the skill and feeling of a
gre.ir musician. Then he would kneel at
an old oak prayer desk, thanking God for
his "health and wealth, his perseverance,
his brains, his power of appreciating
beautiful things" and praying for their
continuance.
Then he would get Into bed and sleep
soundly.
When it was necessary he could bribe
an editor, and he was master of the art
of manipulating shan B.
This man of genius had pome mines to

Mr. Alington Is the most individual and
powerful figure, while Jack and Kit are
the subjects of the story. And Jack's
money making and Kit's, mad dance in
dangerous places are not in the least con
ed. A more profound weakness Is
that the characters are described; they
are made to act. but do not Beem to act
from Inward necessity. Alington's music

are not part of him. Kit's repentance is
not analyzed and made credible. Repen

The Forestry Division of the United
States Department of Agriculture has
published the first part of a Primer of
Forestry, by Gilford Pinchot, in whirh ;.n
exposition is made of the most essential
facts of forest life. A second part will
contain ;tn elementary dlÃcusslon of prac
tical forestry. Mr. Pinchot baa shown
great skill in presenting scientific concep
tions in a popular and Interesting but
exact manner; and the large number of
well-chosen illustration? which accom
pany the text of the book make his m>an
ing clear evtu to those who have no
previous knowlege of the subject.
The primer describes the way In which
a tree takes food, breathes, grows, forms
wood, strives for a foothold, striiggl'-s
with its fellows, helps its neighbors md
is helped by them, grows old and becomes
ripe for the ax, and tells what enemies
It has to fear. The most interesting part
of the primer is the chapter on the life
of a forest, j
"A forest tree is in many ways as much
dependent upon its neighbors for safety
and food as are the inhabitants of a town
upon one another. The difference is that
in a town each citizen has a special call
ing or occupation in which he works for
the service of the commonwealth, while
in the forest every tree contributes to the
general welfare in nearly all the ways in
which it is benefited by the community.
A forest tree helps to protect its neighbors
against the wind, which might overthrow
them, and the sun, which is ready to dry
up the soil about their roots, or to make
fun cracks in their bark by shining too
hotly upon it. It enriches the earth in
which they stand by the fall of its leaves
and twigs, and aids In keeping the air
about their crowns, and the soil about
their roots, cooler in summer and warmer
in winter, than it would be if each tree
stood alone. With the others it forms a
common canopy under which the seed
lings of all the members of this protec
tive union are sheltered in early youth,
and through which the beneficent Influ
ence of the forest is preserved and ex
tended far beyond the spread of the trees
themselves. But while this fruitful co
operation exists, there is also present,
just as In a village or city, a vigorous
strife for the good things of life. For a
tree the best of these, and often Uae hard-

est to get, are water for the roots and
epace and light for the crown. In all but
very dry places there Is water enough for
all the trees, and often more than Â©nough.
as, for example, In the Adirondack forest.
Tho struggle for space and light Is thus
more Important than tha struggle for
water.
"The story of the life of a forest crop
Is then largely an account of the competi
tion of trees for light and room, and al
though the very strength which enables
them to carry on the fight is the result
of their association, still the deadly strug
gle, in which the victims are many times
more numerous than those which survive,
is apt alone to absorb the attention. Yet
the mutual help of the trees to each otner
is always going quietly on. Every tree con
tinually comforts and assists the other
trees, which are its friendly enemies "
It Is by this mutual relationship that
clear lumber is produced. As the growth
of the trees advances their tops meet
The lower branches, deprived of light and
air, grow sickly and die. The new wood
as It forms squeezes the bases of these
branches and they break off. The hole
Is soon covered, and the trunk of the tree
forms wood unbroken by any knot. It is
a bare pole, which in time will form logs
of solid lumber.

taken so that its place shall in time be
filled again by another noble trte, to be
cut in Its turn? Finding the right answer
to these questions is forestry
The Forestry Division of the Bureau of
Agriculture is engaged In finding the right
answer from a practical point of view.
There is no eubjecl more misunderstood
and misrepresented than the act'vities of
this division. It is not esthetic or senti
mental or possessed by a mania for keep
ing forests untouched. It is as hard
headed about a forest as a hullpuneher on
a ten-yoke team. The practical side of
its work la shown by the fact that large
owners of timber lands in the Adlron
dacka are operating their property under
a system recommended by tho Govern
ment export, and that owners of redwood
lands on ihis coast are co-operating with
the Government in support of a scientific
investigation of tho besl method Tor ad
ministering those lands. Cramped for
means, as the division is, It has done
much :isi fu! work, arid it shows wisdom
in issuing such little manuals as the one
under consideration, with a view to public
education.
The peculiar importance of forestry in
this State Is the justification for nving
this little book so much attention In these
columns. The ruin of our forests, even
the clearing of our brushlands in some
places-, would be a sheer act of financial
suicide, in somi parts of the State the
preservation of woodlands to act as
storage md distributing reservoirs is a
mutter of life and death, a? Mr. Kinney
says. Farmers and I'ruit -growers know
what water is. The miners of Idaho have
learned by cruel experience how im
portant the forest is to them; the minors
of California ran profit by Lheir lesson.
The torrents which flow over a deforested
country can\\ great Quantities of mud,
which silt up rivers and shoal mrbors.
For the lumberman himself, if lie owns
land, the preservation of the forest is of
importance. In short, all and every in
habitant of this State has a direct interest
in forest preservation. To some it menus
all. to some a little, to most it moans
much. The public-spirited energrv of the
Department of Agriculture should be sup
ported by the whole commonwealth of
California.
The primer is distributed free of
charge and may probaMy be most easily
obtained through the local Congressman.
Maomtllan & Company have published
new editions of F. Marion Crawford's
"The Ralstons," and of Horace Annesley
Vaehell's "A Drama in Sunshine." The
fundamental soundness of public taste is
shown by the uniformly high excellence
of books that obtain the honors of a re
print. To-day's admiration may be a
craze; to-day's neglect blindness; but
yesterday's admiration that lasts to-day
is pretty sure to be well founded. Katha
rine LauderdÂ».le will look out from the
pages of "The Ralstons" alive, charming
young and beautiful for many a long day
yet. And it will be long before "A Drama
in Sunshine" ceases to pulsate with life.
The book is, of course, the more interest

period In California, at the very end of
which we are standing. (The Macmillan

"Cattle Ranch to College," by Russell
Doubleday, Is the story of the life of a
boy in the "Far West"â that is, in Da
kota, Wyoming and Montanaâtwenty
five years ago. It is practically a true
story. The Impression of monotonous
and "dreary hardship, and still more mo
notonous and dreary ideas and amuse
ments, produced by the account of one
bitter struggle and barren sport after an
other, is .pathetically confirmed by one
or two little touches of the boy's life.
What a picture of family life in the
father's jeering at his son for being beat
en in a fight with a grown man. What
an Iliad of deprivation In the words: "Of
baseball, marbles, tops and all the games
of skill and strength dear to the town
dweller our boys knew nothing; their
amusements were akin to their work â to
ride well and to shoot straight was a
matter of business as well as pleasure
for them."
The book Is painfully Illustrated with
photographs. Their hard perversions of
sunlight and color make them wearisome
to the eye, so that -ihe little marginal
sketches," mere hints of grass-tufts or the
outlines of a lamp, afford an extraordi
nary relief by their touches at art and
grace. The bock Itself suffers from a
similar monotonous hardness of effect.
It Is impressive, however, as a record of
th** stubborn resistance to every kind of
obstacle which gives theÂ» American, like
like the Scotchman and the Englishman,
bo much power and force. (.Doubleday &
McClure Co., New York, $1 50.)
"The Mickey Finn Idylls," by Ernest
Jarrold. is one of the best of the long
list of books dealing with the home life
of the Irish laborer. It is composed of
a series of disconnected stories, each giv
ing an account of some interesting epi
sode in the life of Mickey Finn. Although
the main part of the book is full of pure
Irish fun and humor, it contains also a
charming element of pathos and love for
nature seldom found in this class of
books. One of the prettiest of those is in
the chapter where Mickey is described as
finding his mother in tears because she
could secure no shamrock for her birth
day "to mind her of the vale o' Glen
more." Mickey resolves to go to the
woods in the deep snow to a rock where
he knows some "Yankee shamrock"
grows, "to put it aroun' the sugar bowl
agin' the mornin'." His return home with
the arbutus through the snow and storm,
against which he plodded until he leÂ»l into
the road exhausted and freezing, offers
one of the prettiest touches in the book.
Of pure fun perhaps the best chapter is
on Mik< Welsh's ram. This ram, recent
ly brought to Coney Island, proved to be
a dangerous one. It happened that Pat
soy Fogarty was passing through the
field, when the ram furiously charged
upon him. As a measure of safety, Pat-
Bey seized him by the horns and was
stiM holding him when Mike Welsh, the
owner, came by. "Lave go o' that ram!"
shouted Mike, running up. "Is It tryin'
to stale him ye are?" "Devil a stale
him," replied Patsey; "I was just seem'
had he any strength In his neck. Come
down and hoult him a minute, Mike.
Faix, he's stronger nor a bull." "Is that
so?" replied Mike, jumping over the wall;
"give me a hoult of him. till I see is he
that sthrong." Patsey then went cheer
fully to the fence and laughed at Mike,
whose face was dripping with perspira
tion, while the whole village soon assem
bled on the fence, offering comforting re
marks, and Mike still held on. struggling
violently. He was not released until
Mickey Finn came along, seized the ram's
tail and aided Mike to throw him over
the fence.
Mickey's accounts of the wonderful
things he learns in his history and geog
raphy are very amusing, as is also the
story of the taking of the census. The
whole book is indeed cleverly written and
very entertaining. (Doubleday & McClure
Co. $1 25.)
To read "California Fruits," by Profes
sor Wlckson, Is to smell the perfume of
the apple blossoms and the orange flowers
in the orchards, the scent of wild sagp
and manzanita blooms from the hills, and
almost imagine that you have a largo
sized check from the Fruit Growers'
Union in your inside pocket. It is a book
for the fruit grower to read, study and in
parts commit to memory.
It Is thoroughly Californlan In every
line, and not a rehash of some pamphlet
on "Truck Gardening" that was written
by a man who lived In the New Jersey
swamps and had to drain things in sum
mer and blanket them In winter to make
them grow.
Why failures have been made by some
in attempting fruit culture Is plainly
shown In Professor Wickson's writing. It
is a very simple matter to raise fruit
when you have such a plain guide, and It
13 difficult to do so when you do not know
how and have to do three times as much
work as is necessary, and then perhaps
see a two-year-old orchard die -without
possibility of relief, by reason of some
fatal mistake that could not be rectified
after planting.
There is nothing left to be imagined or
guessed at, the book Is complete, nnd be
sides that, while It is technically correct
and goes into many Interesting minutae
and details of description, there is nothing
involved or complicated In the style of
writing.
It begins at the beginning, takes ihÂ»
mountain slope covered with manzanlta
and chaparral and leads step by step
through each part of every process of
clearing, planting and tending the orchard
or vineyard until the grower receives his
bill of lading from the railroad, for his
shipment of green or dried fruit.
A list of some of the subheadings of the
book makes pleasant reading to one who
has been through the experiences and
finds his own conclusions verified or im
proved upon, but it is even more pleasant
to those who have the delights of antici
pation, for with this book you may sit
down winter evenings at home and plan
out every twig on every tree with the
kind of "tree and its location and what
sort of soil it shall be in and what fertil
izer and how much water It shall have.
In fact, it gets farming, or rather the
frult-ralslng part of It, Into something
more like an exact science than the lot
tery which it has heretofore been.
Under the head of general information
Is given the climate of California and its
local modifications, ranging from the tor
rid region about Indio, where the sun ever
shines on burning sands and the date
palm and pineapple grow with the banana
in the oases, to the edge of the glaciers
on Whitney, where nothing but the hard
iest apples and kindred northern fruits
can ripen. These, of course, are only the
freaks of climate. The great bulk of the
State is temperate and produces the fruits
of both extremes. Why the California
climate is so specially favorable to ihe
growth of fruit is shown to be largely by
reason of the lack of humidity in the air
allowing the full benefit of the sun's rays
to act upon the leaves and fruit.
Fruit soils of California make an impor
tant chapter for the man who has ttill
his selection of land to make and in a
lesser degree to the man who has not yet
planted his fruits and can get those which
best suit the soil already owned.
The chapter on wild fruits of California
shows the natural tendency of the Slate
to fruit production and takes a Califor
nlan back to the time of boyhood, when
he climbed over the green carpeted ridges
of the Sierras picking wild plums and
cherries to make marmaladeâ and black
berries, raspberries and strawberries for
An interesting description of the Mission
fruits, those planted by the Spanish mis
sionaries, concludes the historical part of
the work, and then commences the solid
work with grubhoe, plow and spade. The
cultural division of the volume is very
complete and in full of new wrinkles for
old hands as well as for the beginner.
Its sub-headings are as follows:
Clearing land for fruit.
The nurseryâ budding and grafting.
Preparation for plantingâ planting the
trees.
Pruning orchard trees and thinning 1
fruit.
Cultivationâ fertilizers for fruit tree*
and vines.
irrigation.
Part third is devoted to a description
and habitat of each of the many Cali
fornia fruits with all their advantages
and peculiarities.
Grape propagationâ planting and care â
occupies a division by itself.
Semi-tropical fruitsâ the date, fig, olive,
orange, lemon and limeâ are treated at
length, and in shorter space the banana,
guava, juiube loquat. persimmon, pine
apple, pomegranate, prickly and alligator
pears all make interesting reading and
arouse an intense desire in the reader to
get land aid tools and set to work.
Economy is given prominent place all
through, for in a business aa large as
fruit-raising, with its many ramifications,
becomes, rmall economies are a source of
large profits Five acres under cultiva
tion as illustrated by Mr. Wlckson would
in most cases pay more net profits than
lf.o acres planted to hay or grain in the
old way.
The book is a treat for every one In
terested in nature, whether from the
standpoint of practical money-making,
scientific investigation or mere romantic
interest, and will be a standard library
book. (Pacific Rural Press, San Fran
cisco. $2 50.)
Mr. Sebastian Evans has translated Into
English the earliest record of the activity
of St. Francis of Assisi from the rather
recently discovered Latin manuscript of
the Mirror of Perfection, by the saint's
beloved companion, Brother Leo. No
where else is there so clear a picture of
St. Francis' simplicity, of his whole-heart
edness. of his freedom from the fear of
man that maketh a snare. The simple
energy of this record is such that it
strikes a reader as very inappropriate for
Mr] Evans to translate it into an artificial
old English, speaking of the "sick and
heal," instead of the sick and well; call
ing: a physician a leech and In general
artitkializing Brother Leo's quaint but
crabbed and honest Latin into a pseudo
quaint pretended old dialect which affords
no pleasure to any but a sentimentalized
lover of affectation. The effort, though
made on a false basis, is carried out with
very great skill and some scholarship. (L
C. Page & Co., Boston.)
There is no social force more subtle and
therefore more powerful than art. Not
merely in subject but in manner it exerts
an influence more profound than would be
supposed by those who have not thought
about It. Paradoxical as it may seem
to say that the quality of a line, the plac
ing of patches of light and shadow, the
cadences of a line of poetry or the turn
of a phrase may tend to elevate or debase
a whole character, it. Is certainly true.
Art neglected or taken lightly will have
Its revenge. The sense of this intimat*
connection between art and life has Im
pelled the French critic, M. Brunetiere, In
nls lectures on "Art and Morality" to an
earnest warring against the view of art
often taken in our day, that it is a thing
apart from conduct, living- in a world of
its own and directed by laws indifferent
to ordinary laws 01 morality. Wildly as
we may differ from Individual judgment*,
or even from general conclusions of the
French critic, the soundness of his atti
tude In this lecture must be iidmitted by
every one who beiieves there is such a
thing as right and wrong in human con
duct. Human life is a whole, and thÂ«
claims of righteousness leave no depart
ment of life outside of their boundsâ least
of all the most refined and the most dis
tinctively human of all departments of
life. Professor Beatty of the University
of Wisconsin has translated the lecture
with ingenuity, delicacy and force. (T. Y.
Croweli & Co., New York; 35 oents.)

WHAT THE
VOCALISTS
THEMSELVES
HAVE TO
SAY ABOUT
CHOIR WORK.
Â«=p=3HERE Is a training school for
' opera sinners in our rr.iost. It is
j[ the church choir.
Tell this to the choir directors or
the ministers and they will probably not
be nice about it. The choir director will
Eay that the height of art is reached In
sacred music, nr.d the minister, if he does
not call you wicked, will at least say
"flippant." Nevertheless, if you run over
the rames of our grand and comic opera
singers you will find more than you can
count on a good many times your ten
fingers whoso first public appearance was
In the church quartet. Names like Helen
Bertram and Jessie Bartlett Davis are
among them] Furthermore, go among the
choir singers of this city, and after a
confidential talk with each one, ask her
casually if she ever thinks of going on
the str^ge. She will flutter a little and
murmur something about "Of course, one
always hopes," or she "Can't deny she
has had an idea of it."
Ask them and see. And if It occurs to
you to find fault, Inquire Into the salaries
that the church.-s of San Francisco pay
their singers, and then consider. One
must live.
In New York SICOO per year is a fair sal
ary; â $2*,00 is the highest known to be paid
and 11 â â  minimum In any church is $25 per
month. C'mpnre that minimum with the
maximum of San FrnneiFeoâ s3o. Not a
pretty comparison. !s it?
There are some artists In our local
church choirs, but wo cannot expect to
have many nor keep them long on such
salaries.
"The singers leave and go East at their
first opportunity." says Miss Xena Rob
ert?. "They can't make a living here
unies? they do something else to help out.
I teach kindergarten from 9 until 2 five
days of the week"; then I go to to choir
rehearsals on Saturday and sing at two
Sunday ' Ices."
Miss Roberts is the contralto at Ply
mouth Congregational Church. She lives
far out on Howard street in a fiat where
one Is faced by a musical instrument at
every turn. She has brothers who twang
and tinkle, and she likes the piano herself.
'.'Talking about salaries," she said, "I
â went to one of the largest churches In
Oakland some time ago to apply for a po
sition. The choir director looked me over
carefully, and finally announced, 'Now,
I'll tell you what I'm after. I want a hun
dred-dollar singer for twenty a month.' "
Miss Grace Davis Is one of the cholÂ»
singers who doubles her Income by work
in? in a Jewish and a Christian church on
Saturday and Sunday. She rehearses at
Geary-street Temple on Friday, sings
thore at the forenoon service next day. re
hearses in the afternoon at the First Con
gregational and goes to morning- and
evening service there on Sunday. "I sing
a great deal In concerts," says Miss Da
vis. "You see. I don't have much time to
waste. The church singing la not espe
cially easy. Many who have excellent
voices lack the training required. In the
large city churches a singer must be ex
perienced enough to get along without
much choir rehearsing. Once a week is all
that Is customary. "We must read quickly
and accurately. The work is pleasant and
excellent practice." .
Miss Davis smiled her bright soprano
smile and appeared to have thoughts of
her own. Practice for what, don't you
wonder?
Trinity Church, on Bush street, has al
ways been known as a place where good
music attracted many lonely Sunday peo
ple who had no other inclinations church
ward. Mrs. Eva Tenny and Miss Millie
Flynn are sopranos there, and Mrs. J. E.
Birmingham the contralto
SAN FRANCISCO`S
BEST KNOWN
CHURCH
SINGERS
Miss Flynn ifl paid to bave the highest
range of al! our sopranos. She Is a busi
ness-like young person, who knows tho
value of her voice In terms of the cold,
cold world. She has been said to put a
very firm foot down In regard to salaries,
but it is only a I%A foot, and there are so
many voluntary singers.
Mrs. Tenny makes a home for herself
and little son, and it's a cozy home, too.
There an pictures In it -portraits of mas
ters who have guldod Mrs. Tenney's work
and to whom she Is grateful.
"Miss Flynn nnd 1 both sing at Satur
day service?, " she said. "She at the Tay
lor street Temple and I at Bush street;
It keeps us busy."
Yes, busy; and there's another phase
of the matter. A New York paper Is
eaylnpr that the synagogues are having
the best of the bargain In such case 3,
and tho same thing holds true hero. "ThÂ«
Sunday churches are getting only the fag
end of the singer's voice," says a writer.
"What with Friday rehearsals for tho
synagogue, Saturday's elaborate and dif
ficult service there and Saturday night's
rehearsal for Sunday's service, the singer
arrives at the Christian service Sunday
morning pretty well worn out."
Mrs. Birmingham has come back to uÂ«
with method refreshed by European life.
Her dramatic personality and voice qual
ity suggest "La Traviata" or "Santuzza"
far more than Episcopal anthems.
One of Henschel's pupils Is Miss
Ella McClosky of Holy Cross Church and
Taylor street Temple. "There was such
a little time to study with him." she said
regretfully. "But I tried to make the
most of every minute. He was kind and
encouraging, too, although he has a
frankness that Is German In its complete
ness. I know that I owe a great deal to
even the little time that I could study
with him, for the man's personality Is an
Inspiration."
The soprano of St. Mary's Cathedral
is Mies Katherine Black, who Is known
on weekdays to educational circles. She
divides the rounds of our Beventy-two
public schools with one other special
teacher of music, and on Sunday she la
bors with the elaborate music required In
the cathedral.
"The first tlma that I remembered
Binglng v.-as when I was 12 years old,"
Miss Black Bald. "I Fang a solo in church
and I had on a beautiful red dress. I
wasn't a bit afraid of anything except
that some one might think I was afraid,
and I paid much more attention to keep-
Ing my kneea still than 1 did to the solo.
But my knees would waggle, no matter
how hard I tried to stop iHem."
Miss Black's mother interrupted, "No,
that wasn't your first singing, my dear,
though it may be the first you remem
ber. When you were three years old w>
used to put you on a table to sing foÂ»
company, and you remember old Mr.
Smith of the Mint? He would give y<<\i
money to sing, and after you were once
started you enjoyed your voice so that
he had to give you more money to get
you to stop."
Miss Black recalls a lone Interview with
THE SUNDAY CAIjI^
Melha when the great Marguerite vlsltefl
San Francisco: "That was three years
ago, and I was so discouraged at the
time because I could not go to Europe.
But Melba said that it would je time
enough when I was almost thirty. If I
would keep on in concert and church
work In the meantime I would be mature
enough and able to make the most of my
study then. She tried my voice, playing
the accompaniment herself."
Mrs. Susie Hert-Mark is the soprano of
Calvary Church. She inherits a love for
music and says she cannot remember
when she did not sing. "I used to put
the atlas on the piano stool and the "In
ferno' on top of that and sit working
out my own musical ideas by the hour.
It must have been that as a child I as-
Eociated the high tones with heaven, for
I have always had an idea that the
angols sing in soprano voices. It is Â«uch
nonsense, but you know how an impres
sion clings."
Miss Daisy Conn, soprano of Emanu-
El, lives at home. "The salaries paid
are a help to a girl who has a home,"
Bhe says, "but they are not enough in
themselves to live on. Concert singing'
and teaching help out."
A new contralto In church musical
circles is Miss Isabella Van Pelt of Cal
vary Church. Her voice 1b young and
has a good deal to learn, but It Is worth
teaching.
A home out on Pacific avenue Is as full
of music as the day Is long. It belongs
to Mr. and Mrs. Don Pardee Riggs. Mrs.
Riggs sings In the First Presbyterian
Church, where her experienced soprano
contrasts the youthful, velvety contralto
of Miss Cecelia Decker.
"The work Is hard in Dr. Mackenzie's
church," says Miss Decker, "but I lova
it. I always wnnted to sing In a great
church's chnir, and now I am doing it.
I remember being around our little
church at home when 1 was a mite of a
girl, and hearing the choir rehearse one
day. I .<tole in close to the organ and
listened, and I thought it must be the
happiest thing on earth to sing there.
"I make $S0 a month, and that is a good
salary as they go here. Weddings and
funerals are extrn-^ss apiece. We hava
been very fortunate latelyâ l mean un
fortunate? â that is, a great many people
have died and have had funerals."
Miss Decker blushed. It's a dellcat*
matter, isn't it?THE SUNDAY CALL.

Substitutes for Meat.
*^"f LL animal food has advanoed tm
f I price. Beef alone, for which there
I I :? the heaviest demand, has ad
\^ I vanced 25 per cent. In many houae-
J^ h :ds where appetites are keen
and the amount to supply them with
limit â¢ ::s a reduction In quan
tity or the substitution of other food
which as far c la will take the
of meat. Both the animal and tho
vegetable kingdom supply these. In
wheat, peas and beans of all kinds there
Is a great quantity of nitrogenous ma
terial. Milk, eggs and cheese, particular
ly the two former, are perfect food.
Cheese some people can live on while to
others it Is harmful. Swiss peasants, and
they are a hardy class of people, live
mainly on cluc-se and broad. Those who
are active workers can eat and digeat a
large if cheese, but people who
lead sedentary lives should never eat of
It too heavily or too often. Our markets
having the whole year round such a va
riety of vegetables and otlvr food house
keepers should h;ive no trouble in nnd

recipes contain almost as much nitrogen

Breakfast Pishes.
What one should eat for breakfast Is a
subject which has been discussed time
and time again. To my way of thinking
every one knows, or at least should know,
what is the best food for him in the
morning. One writer says: "It is a fear
ful mistake to eat a heavy meal after ris
ing. The system is tired and not in work
ing order; lungs, stomach and liver have
left over tasks to perform, and until they
are performed good work should not bo
expected from the brain or that finer na
ture which, for want of a better name,
we call the soul. Give nature a chance;
make haste slowly; tax the machinery of
digestion llghtJy and by noon the physical
household will be better able to fight the
battles of life." Perhaps she is right, but
few people can work six hours on one
small cut) of coffeo and a dry biscuit It
Is true that the French have but a cupful
of coffee after rising:, and also true that
Instead of our two or three meals a day
they have six.
Don't try to rernlate yonr diet to con
form with the Ideas of writers on that
subject, for If you do Just expect to be a
confirmed dyspeptic within three months.
Eat what you like. Nature will soon tell
you what Is not good and to be avoided.
If you are hungry in the morning eat, and
eat what Is wanted, coffee and toast or a
four course breakfast.
Oatmeal porridge Is called the national
breakfast of America, and for those who
can digest it it is one of the cheapest and
most satisfying foods. It contains a great
deal of protein and fat and therefore can
be eaten daily without Injuring the appe
tite.
To make It properly the rule is: To a
half pint of whole grained oatmeal add
one quart of cold water and a small tea
spoonful of salt; place it in a double boil
er and cook slowly for two hours and a
half. Stir every now and then and when
done it should be creamy. Oatmeal can
bt cooked one day and reheated for the
next morning's breakfast.
TOMATO TOASTâ Pour the contents ot
one can of tomatoes- into a saucepan, add
one tablespoonful each of butter and
sugar, one teaspoonful of salt, one-half a
teaspoonful of pepper and cook ten
minutes. When hot thicken with corn
starch which has been moistened with a
little water. Butter the toast, trim and
put on a dish or on Individual dishes and
on each piece put two or three tablespoon
fuls of tomato and one poached egg Lay
pieces of bacon on the side of each plato
and serve.
CORN CAKESâ Into a bowl sift one pint
of yellow meal, one pint of flour, three
tablespoonfula each of sugar and baking
powder, one heaping teaspoonful or
salt and one largo tablespoonful of but
ter. Mix as for pie crust, add the beaten
yolk* of two ergv and one pint of vattX,
Mix well and add lastly the beaten
whites. Butter the muffin pans, dust
with meal, fill with the mixture and bake
In a quick oven. Berve as Boon as done.
CUP EGO ON TOABTâ Butter as many
small cups as needed, dust with bread

cups into it, cook until the whites art

But my Lady of Leisure, she who sips a
cup of chocolate at midday, must needs
wear a negligee that is the quintessence
of beauty. A petticoat fluffy with laces
end ribbons may be worn with a chic
little matinee, or a flowing negligee clings
fmm head to feet:
The evolution of the negligee Is as In
structive as it is interesting. The negli
gee was once a combing jacket; then It
graduated into a "matinee" and finally
evoluted into a negligee.
Each of these transformations likewise
marks an epoch in society. In the comb-

pimple tastes. Each bonny bride num
b'-rr-d in her trousseau a half dozen comb
ing Jackets, all unadorned. Their use was
exactly what their name signifiedâ a
Jacket to be worn when combing tho
When society began to put on frills the
combing jacket discarded its simplicity
for furbelows. It crept out of its chrysa
lis of flannel into lawn and silk and rib
bons and laces. It took unto Itself a new
name borrowed from la belle Parislenne,
who had alv/ays worn these dainty little
From th.Â» matinee to the negligee was
a short step. The first born of the negli
gees wen not the "creations" that their
descendants are. They ere simply loose
wrapperlike gowns and not particularly
beautiful. The negligee of to-day Is a
soft shimmering affair with billowy laces
and dainty ribbons. One must possess a
half dozen of these going up the scale
beautiful, until a drr-am in loveliness is
reached. The gorgeous ones are for the
afternoon.
Slippers and stockings are a serious
consideration with the negligee, for the
feet "like little mice peep in and out,"
and If they air- not daintily shod the har
mony is destroyed.
A pretty woman never looks as well in
anything as in th<-s. negligees. It is the
half-concealing, half-revealing charm of
these gowns that makes them so tanta
llzingJy beautiful. Just how fetching they
are the accompanying photographs Illus

A petticoat which in its richness and
simplicity makes one think of brides and

1Â« cut in points, edped with the lace and
finished with a tiny, double-pinked ruffle
of plain Mack taffeta. Two rows of black
velvet ribbon run on to follow the shape
of the points of the flounce, and above
each point the lace leaves appli<iued; the
top of the flounce is finished with a double
ruffle of tho plain black taffeta.
The satin petticoats are just too lovely
to be covered, and one especially makes
one wonder how any one could have the
courage not to show it. It is pule pink bro
caded satin, the flowers a deep rose color
and pale green rose buds strewn here and
there over it. The flounce is made of four
rows of cream-colored lace, finished Â«vith
a puff of chiffon. Above the chiffon Â«irÂ©
two rows of insertion, one of pink em
broidered chiffon and the other to match,
the lace. The skirt was lined with soft,
pink silk.
Another Is a soft preen, with flounce
of the same cream-colored lace, and fin
ished off with a puff of white chiffon.
A pale pink matinee* made of tucked
taffeta and trimmed with white lace and
pink satin ribbon makes one happy Just
to look at it.
A dainty blue-gray one trimmod with
ruffles of white bobinet and ribbon with
forget-me-nots, is odd as well as pretty.
It is made short In back like a bolero
and has two long paniers on each side,
reaching the top of the flounce, edged
with the bobinot and ribbon. Another odd
matinee is made of cashmere and em
broidered In black, a trailing design run

pretty. Pink seems to b^ the favorite
color. Tight-fitting in back and trimmed
with Insertion and accordion-pleated
ruffles.
The prettiest and perhaps the most per

Turk running across, edged with lace,
forms the yoke, and white lace put in

ORIGIN OF THE WEDDING RING.
ACCORDING to legend. Jupiter sent
to Prometheus in honor of lils de
liverance by Hercules a ring In
which was set a piece of the stone to
which Prometheus had formerly been
bound in chains.
In Northern mythology the ring: sym
bolizes the bridge from this world to the
next, or, according to another idea, the
rainbow symbol of eternity. Hence it is
plain that from most ancient times the
ring was a symbol of remembrance and
#iÂ»rnai recollection. Since the earliest

weight of opinion among tea experts la

the two.
"The garden is mostly situated on a
knoll, but a portion extends down into
moist low .rind. The soil la a clayey loam,
with a rather stiff clay subsoil. It lias
been heavily enriched every spring with
a high grade fertilizer, at th< rate re

acre. Each summer cowpeas are sown,

soil, as well as to prevent its being

Tho custom of wearing the wedding ring
on the fourth finger of the left hand
goes back for its origin to the Egyptians,
from whom the Greeks borrowed the cus

fourth finger was dedicated to Apollo, the

that the crop of this year from the South
Fms. r garden will exceed 500 pounds, or
250 pounds per acre.
"As a yiehl of 200 pounds per acre is
qultr exceptional in China, the r<>puli is
very encouratfngr, especially as there is
no reason to believe that this garden has
reached its maximum production. It is,
of course, quite impossible to predict
what the ultimate yield may be. A crop
Â< 200 pounds to tho acre is quKe re

Another theory is that the ring was the

for the wedding ring also, being worn on
the right hand until the marriage, when
it is transferred to the left. In Spain the

ADMIRAL DEWEY`S
NEW HOME
rf yon walk Aorwa Rhod* Island ave
n-nÂ« In the city of Washington
you will see a certain square, solid
house, which look* for ail the world
Ilk* the rest of the hou*ee In the
block. ThÂ« only thing: that distinguishes
It la that Admiral Dewej- Is to live In it.
There Is a great. great difference be
t-ween this hotxae and the admiral's old
home. P<*rhapÂ« In the bigness and com
pleteneae of the capital dwelling he will
think a bit longingly now and then of the
sprawling, vlney old place on a quiet Ver
mont street â a place where elms stretch
their branch** over the peaked roof, and
where green shutter* ; inclose twelve
pan ed windows. If he ever feÂ«ls any little
sensations of this kind he can excuse hlra
celf for a moment from officers and
â¢aateeman and steal out to his back yard,
It is the only spot about the new home
that can ever suggeet Vermont demure
ness.
It ]Â» as green a patoh of ground as
faithful sprinkling has been able to make
It: Weeds have been hunted down and
made way -with, except for two dandelion
plajits that are putting out late flowers
even now In honor of the returning hero.
The old gardener who has charge of the
place ha* chertahed those and allowed
them to keep four yellow stars blooming
at a timo.
Grapovlr.es, once heavy with purple Isa
bellas, hang over the back door. The
whole Is a snatch of country sot down In
ptatfly Washington. If the admiral will
pardon x.a, wÂ» will drop In at this low
back door now that we are here. Inform
ality is so pleasant, you know.
The kiich'-n is a place to gladden the
h*>art f,f Mrs. J)>-wey. It is the most mod
ern and approved or kitchens, with gloam
ing white sinks and tilesj and cupboards
that fit into all sons of. corners. The pan
try is almost as big as the kitchen, and
has a sunny window opening upon the
yard. The outfit has all been made com
plete, even to the cans labeled cinnamon
and cloves.

A wide ilreplace Is snuggled In between
bookcases and gives promise of Rood
cheer for snowy evenings Here privi
leged people who are not confined to the
more precise drawing-room can be com
fortable and tell stories or listen; There
is a wide and a deep chair of golden
brown brocade, meant especially for the
fireside and the admiral; and there la an
other. Just as wide and just as deep, for
a lucky guest.
Above the fireplaceâ higher even than
the picture moldingâ stretches a panel of
stained class thai will catch the after
noon light and trickle colors across the
carpet. The opposite Ide of the room is
dark, and a cozy corner, knee deep in
cushions, is half hidden there. Gleams of
yellow throughout the room relieve the
brown-yellow cushion, yellow lamp shade,
yellow table scarf. Ragged yellow chrys
anthemums are growing in the west win
dow in a big Japanese jardiniere
From the dim, restful library the draw
ing-room opens, sunny and brightly fur
nished It is Frenchy in blue and gold,
with little Louis chairs that are spin
dling and airy, and big Louis chairs that
are firm and courtly. A wreath and bow
knot design glitters on the poarl-iintcd
wall and the pictures are pastels and
broader more cheerful canvases set in
gold and white enamel. There are flow
ered satin tete-a-tetes and dainty tables
for ornaments and a marble Faith on
ebony pedestal.
Between heavy lace and blue velvet
glimpses may be caught of the solemn
street. The ' front window Is a three
faced bay that lets in a flood of sunshine
when sunshine there i.Â«. Near the win
dow stands the piano an upright in light
wood, draped in an embroidery of white
dahlias on blue.
The fireplace" was designed for the
house's new occupant. It Is set in en
dollthlo marble and is inconsistently co
lonial in form. ' It gleams merrily with
aa much brass as uses can be found for
fire dogs dud fender and tongs and all
rifS. In the mantel are bisques
and small marbles and Venetian glass.
Out through the hall and upstairs to
th<' apartments above, it isn't easy to
hurry through the hall, though, for it Is

open fire and warm red walls. Raised

Two or three sea views hang on the wall,
which is covered with a hard pattern In
. old colors. The one home-like place on
tliM second floor is the admiral's private
_ room opening from his chamber.
Tt is furnished much like the library be

other bedrooms are on both second and
third floors, and Lieutenant Crawford has
a small office over the front hall. Ser
vants' quarters and bathrooms, store
rooms and linen closets complete the
house. A red cedar clnset, such as would
d. light any housekeeper's heart, fits
neatly Into the space under the upper
stalls.
All this comfort has the $Â£0,000 sub-
