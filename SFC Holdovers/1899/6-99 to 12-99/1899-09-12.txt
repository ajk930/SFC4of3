Group of Tuaregs of the Air Country, Where the Mission Is Re
ported to Have Been Massacred.
TRIPOLI, Sept. 11.â A courier who has arrived here reports that the French mission, headed by
I Fr. Foureau and Major Lami, has been annihilated. He says the mission was attacked by an im
â¢ mense body of Tuaregs, who, after suffering terrible loss, killed all the members of the mission
by force of arms.
On March 22 of this year a dispatch was transmitted from Algiers to Paris that a party
of Tuaregs had attacked a European expedition on its way to Air, in the Sahara, killing 100 men
and capturing a part of the caravan. It was said that the expedition attacked must have been
the Foureau-Lami expedition, but on March 23 official dispatches reached Paris from Biskara, 247
miles southeast of Algiers, that the Foureau-Lami expedition had arrived at Agadez months ear
lier, and that it could not therefore be the party killed by the Tuaregs.
The Poureau-Lrfunl mission started
from Algiers in tho summer of 1898,
with the intention of crossing the Sa
hara Deseri by way of Assime, Air and
z to the Lake Tchad country
which had shortly before, by agreement
with Germany and Great Britain, been
included within the French "sphere of
Influence."
The expedition was a large and lm
tg one, comprising over 250 Spa
his, tirailleurs, picked riflemen, several
1 undred caravan men and a very large
number of animals.
All the larger garrisons, Fort Mac-

republic, through General Lucas,
the commander of the army corps at
Rennes, their sincere desire that Drey

PARIS, Sept. 11.â A serious fire broke
out this evening in the Rue Barbey,
which was recently Invaded by an
archist rioters. A large warehouse
filled with upholsters' materials has al
ready been destroyed. When the po-lice
attempted to-clear the streets they were
hooted by roughs and several firemen
were severely Injured.
Later in the evening an attempt was
made by a band of men shouting "Vive
l'anarchie!" to break into St. Jo
seph's Church. The sacristan, armed
with a gun, appeared in the doorway
of the church and threatened to blow
the brains out of the first man who en-
I tered. The crowd then retired.
Shortly afterward a force of police
appeared and cleared the streets. Dur
ing the struggle a revolver was fired
at the officer in command, but no one
was injured.

shouting "Down with the Jesuits!"
threatened the French Consulate. The
police interfered and a fight ensued, in
which many persons were hurt. Twen

AGITATION TO ABANDON PARTICIPATION IN
THE PARIS EXPLOSION.
Injustice of tfee Verdict in tfee DpeyfuÂ§ Case Will Cause Public
and Private Attempts to Retaliate IDpon
Fpanee,
WASHINGTON, Sept. 11.â It is
believed that when Congress
assembles there will be con
siderable agitation of a prop- I
osition for this Government
to abandon its participation in the
Paris Exposition. It is known that ex- J
pressions hostile to the exposition i
quoted from Senator Stewart are very â¢
widely sympathized in, and it is
thought that if the conviction of Drey- ;
fus is permitted to stand there will be
very little friendly feeling for France ,
among members of either the House or i
Senate.
Such a move, however, would be a i
grave one. It is pointed out that to !
withdraw from participation in the ex- !
position would be regarded as an offl- '
cial insult to France. No further legis
lation on the part of Congress is needed
to carry out the plans of this country
for the exposition. About $1,200,000 has
been appropriated for the expenses of ,
the commission and the Government !
exhibit. The commission has been ap- j
pointed and the space desired for the
exhibit from this country has been se- j
cured.
There are now only two ways in which i
Congress could interfere. One would j
be to revoke such part of the appro- j
priation as has not been already ex- i
pended in the xpenses of the commis
sion and the other would be to pass a
resolution declaring that on account of j
the unsettled conditions the valuable
Government exhibits should not be sent j
to Paris. To do either of these things '
would be sufficient, it is believed, to j
break off all friendly relations between
the two countries. Congress and the !
State Department may look at the mat- \
ter from different points of view. The j
President and the State Department, j
having the responsibility for maintain
ing our relations with foreign govern- |
ments, cannot be expected to find in |
this affair a reason for involving the j
country in an international complica
tion, and it is likely that the executive
branch of the Government will use
what influence it can to prevent hasty
action.
Unless Congress expressly forbids it |
this Government will proceed with the j
preparations for the exhibition and will
send to Paris such Government ex- ;
hibits as are decided upon, but this will
be done with a realization of the proba
bility that much of the space secured
with such difficulty for private Ameri
! can exhibits will be left vacant. Little
doubt is felt that the latitude allowed
the private citizen will be quite ex
| tensively availed of to withdraw from
' participation in the exposition.
Another difficulty in the way of an
i effort to prevent participation in the
i exposition, however, will be found in
j the fact that before Congress has been
assembled much of the Government ex
hibit probably will be packed and on
its way to Paris, if not actually there.
! The exposition opens in April and the
work of transporting and preparing the
exhibit will have to begin some months
I before that time. Up to this time, it
! is said, the preparation of the Govern
| ment exhibit has not been begun, but
the work will proceed as soon as the
i Government officials are ready.
WAR FEELING YET RUNS
HIGH IN THE TRANSVAAL
PAPE TOWN, Sept. 11.â Four trains
containing refugees from Jo
i hannesburg have arrived here.
\ / Four hundred refugees have also
arrived at Durban. During the i
past week the relief committee of Jo- j
hannesburg assisted 2000 cases of dis
tress reported throughout the Trans
vaal.
PRETORIA, Sept. 11.â Excitement
prevails here pending the decision of
the Cabinet. Secretary of State Petizo
has left this city for Johannesburg and
Cape Town. The likelihood of war is
much discussed. The coming of British
troops is not regarded as meaning cer
tain war, but merely as making up for
the paucity of troops in South Africa,
much commented upon during the past
month.
The burghers of this place are of
fering the Government gifts of meai.
The town has a deserted appearance.
The British diplomatic agent, Conyng
ham Greene, has made a representation
to the Transvaal Government regarding j
the recent arrest of Mr. Pakeman, edi
tor of the Transvaal Leader, and the
Government is sending a reply.
President Kruger has issued a notice
warning burghers who intend to go
shooting beyond the River Limpoo,
which forms for many miles the north
west and north limit of the Transvaal,
that they will be severely punished un
less they first obtain permission from
the local authorities.
The tension remains high pending
the receipt of Mr. Chamberlain's dis-_
patch. It is asserted on excellent au
thority that the Transvaal Govern
ment with a view of keeping the min
ing industry, has decided to protect it
in every way. As a first step the Gov
ernment has notified the Rand com
panies that their men will receive pro
tection as long as they remain peaceful,
and should war unfortunately occur the
men will be given a reasonable time to
leave the country if they desire. It is
officially announced that the article in
the gold law about the confiscation of
claims and mines belonging to people
convicted of treason or conspiracy
against the State, which was last year
eliminated will be re-enforced. The
article also gives the Government power
to order that the mines be worked, and
provides that if this instruction is dis
regarded the Government may work
them through its own agents.
lommander General Joubert denies
that the War Department is ordering
heavy ordnance and rifles. He de
clares that he is anxious for the preser
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 11.âAs
semblyman N. P. Conrey of this
city to-day stated that there is
a quiet movement on foot among
the Jews of this city to influence
legislators, provided an extra
session is held, to ask the Gov
ernor to request the Legislature
to repeal the act of the last Leg
islature appropriating $130,000 for
the Paris Exposition.
Representative Hepburn of lowa said
that he had ceased to marvel at the
methods of French army justice after
observing how the trial of Dreyfus was
conducted. No such trial or verdict
was possible in the United States. He
did not think it would in any way af
fect diplomatic relations between this
country and France, nOr did he think
it would interfere with United States
exhibitors at the coming exposition.
NEW YORK, Sept. 11.â Congressman
J. M. Levy announced to-day that as
soon as Congress meets he will intro
duce resolutions in the House with
drawing the support of this Govern
ment from the Paris Exposition on ac
count of the Dreyfus case.
NEWCASTXiE-ON-TYNE, Sept. 11.â
W. D. Stevens, a shipowner and royal
commissioner to the Paris Exhibition,
has declared that as a result of the
Dreyfus verdict he will not put his
foot on French soil. He adds that
thousands of his countrymen will take
the same attitude. Several important
firms have already declined to exhibit
at Paris.
BERLIN, Sept. 11.â The private agi
tation against the exposition is begin
ning to find vigorous expression. The
VossischeZeitungsays this evening that
,a number of the largest German firms
have pledged themselves to withdraw.
The Berliner Tageblatt says the Ber
lin Council at its next session will con
sider a special motion to withdraw the
Berlin municipal exhibit.
On the other hand the correspondent
of the Associated Press learns on the
highest authority that the German
! Government considers the Dreyfus case
now, under all the conditions, done with
j and does not intend to relinquish official
representation at the exposition. The
official responsible for this assurance
Mklfl that it should be borne in mind
I that despite the Dreyfus case the offl
! cial relations between the two govern
! ments have steadily improved during
recent years.

It is not surprising, therefore, that the

ZOLA DECLARES THE
TRUTH WILL APPEAR
PARIS, Sept. 12.â The Aurore pub
lishes this morning a long letter from
Emile Zola, the novelist, which Is a
pendant to his famous "J'Accuse" let
ter in the early stages of the revision
movement. It concludes as follows:
The Ministry which it.s agents have be
trayed, the Ministry which had the weak
ness to leave big children with muddled
minds to play with matches and knives,
the Ministry which has forgotten that to
govern is to foreseeâ has only to hasten
to act if it does not wish to abandon to
the good pleasure of Germany the fifth
apt of the drama, the denouncement be
fore which every Frenchman should
tremble.
It is for the Government to play this
fifth act as soon as possible in order to
prevent its coming to us from abroad.
The Government can procure the docu
ments. Diplomacy has settled greater
difficulties than this. Whenever it ven
tures to ask for the documents enumer
ated in the bordereau they will be given,
and that will be the new fact which will
necessitate a second revision before the
Court of Cassation, which would be this
time. I hope, fully informed and would

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Sept. With their
accustom enterprise, the New "York
Herald and San Francisco Call, ever
quick to make use of the latest devel
opments of (nee, have made arrange
ments by. which the progress of th"
races. between the Columbia and Sham
rock win be reported by utilizing 4 the
Marconi system of wireless telegraphy.
Recent experiments in Europe have
demonstrated that it is quite possible
to accurately and rapidly communi
cate between distant points. The first
experiments attracting world-wide at
tention were conducted in the spring
of the present year, when messages,
sent from Folkstone, in the south of
England, were received at Boulogne, on
the ' French coast. The experiments
were eminently successful, and imme
diately the Herald and Call, foreseeing
the great advantage to be obtained by
use of this system during the yacht
races, entered into negotiations with
the Wireless Telegraph Company of
London, which controls Signor Mar
coni's patent. As a result the Herald
and Call have secured exclusive rights
of the Marconi system for the yacht
races.
Signor Marconi, with four trained
assistants, sail from Liverpool to-day
on â¢ the Cunard steamer Urania with
all necessary Instruments for use in
reporting the races. The work will be
done under the personal supervision of
Marconi himself, and his assistants are
the same who have been engaged in the
mission of wireleesa dispatches
across the British Channel during the
last six months.
Tin- transmitting instruments will be
placed upon the large ocean-going
Plant line steamer Grand Duchess, up
on the upper "de^R of which a tali pole
extending sixty feet in the air above
the water line will be placed. Signor
Marconi and two of bis assistants will
be on this vessel and a running account
of .he race will be telegraphed. On
bo;.~ d the cable ship anchored near
Sco.i.ind Light a similar pole will be
er&ctfed and here two expert operators
will be si.aioned to receive the message
after it has Sown through the air from
the twift-moving Grand Duchess.
From the cable .-hip a message will be
Hashed by means of submarine and
land wires direct to the Herald office,
thence to The Call.
Some idea of the great possibilities
of the Murconi system was obtained
during the recent British naval ma
neuvers wiien messages were received
and transmitted between scouting
cruisers and the flagship over a dis
tance of more 1 ban forty miles. This
was even more remarkable in its way
than the sending of messages between
New Haven and Dieppe, a distance of
almost eighty miles, as in the Brat place
both receiver and transmitters were on
swift moving ships at the time com
munication was established. â¢

RICH LEDGE OF QUARTZ
FOUND NEAR REDDING
William Wilson Locates What Promises to
Be One of the Most Valuable Mines
in the State,
REDDING, Sept. 11.â A veritable bonanza in the shape of a .-rich goia
be&rtDg ledge has been discovered by a mnn named Wilson. The find is
located about twenty-five miles east of this city, about half-way be
tween the Afterthought and Bully Hill mines. The stories of the rich
nesÂ§ of the ledge seems almost fabulous, but are vouched for by reputa
ble citizens who visited the strike.
The ledg- is clearly outlined for fifteen feet and is three feet thick.
Thr- ore.te literally hanging together with stringers and iibbons of free
gold, some of which are as large as an ordinary s^sed human finger.
Wilson's method of working the ledge is t.. pick off a little of the ore.
then to htnrmteT ft out in a hand mortar. With that primitive and plow
method of working he secured a pint tlneupful <>f the precioafl yellow
metal as the result of on." -lav's unassisted labor.
Dan McCarthy, proprietor Of a Keswick hotel, was nn^ of those who
have seen the veritable mint. He became excited at sight <*f the Im
mense ledere streaked with tha dull yellow metal for whleh men work,
fight and die, and offered the owner $*ofti> for his mine on the spot. Wil
son declined the offer, saying he had that much in siÃht, and he has.
The find characterizes the usual luck attending tenderfoot miners.
as Wilson had no previous experience in either prospecting or mining.
He first discovered a pocket, from which h<= took out several hundred dol
lar*. He followed the lead and in a distance of twenty feet has un
covered the ledge. If it holds out for even a few feet in its present
dimensions and richness Wilson has one of the greatest mines ever dis
covered in Northern California.
COWBOYS SHOOT
DOWN OFFICERS
They Seek to Liberate a
Prisoner.
ARRESTED FOR SMUGGLING
Â»
MAY CAUSE INTERNATIONAL
COMPLICATIONS.
â¦
Mexican Guards Have a Hot Fight
With Cattlemen Who Make Their
Escape to the American
Side.
Â«
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BISBEE. Ariz., Sept. Saturday
afternoon a shooting affray occurred at
N.i. ... nine "miles from here, and as a
result serious international complications
may arise.
James Herron. a cattle man and a resi
dent of La Morita, Sonora, was arrested
by Mexican guards for smuggling horses,
and was being taken to Nogales for trial.
While at Naco a cowboy named Bob
Clayton, an employe of the Erie Cattle
Company, asked permission to go with
Herron to Nogales. The guards assented,
but told Ciayton he would have to disarm
himself and was given thirty minutes to
do so.
In the meantime Clayton had taken
several drinks, and when the guards
asked him to surrender his arms, he re
fused, and drawing his revolver he be
gan to shoot, at the same time backing
towards the American side of the line.
The guards, seven in number, returned
the tire, and two other cowboys, one
named Franco and the other an unknown
man. cam< to Clayton's rescue, Clayton
escaped to this side of the line, not, how
ever, until he had received a bullet from
a Â©-Winchester through his stomach,
from the effects of which he died here
last night.
Captain Molina of the guards was
wounded twice, one ball passing through
his right thigh and another through his
arm. Franco was arrested by the guards
and is now in jail at Naco, while tue
other cowboy escaped and is now on
American soil.
Shortly after the shooting three guards
who had started to Nogales with Herron
were overtaken near San Pedro Custom
house by four American cowboys, who
opened lire on them, killing one guard
and wounding another. The third guard
escaped- unhurt. The cowboys then re
turned to this side of the line, being
pursued by other guards. Herron refused
to return with the cowboys and continued
to Nogales, where he surrendered him
self.
He chose to face the charge of smug
gling rather than risk being taken by of
ficers here, who hold a warrant for him,
he having escaped from the Oklahoma
penitentiary after being sentenced for
twenty-five years for murder. Late Sat
urday night another cowboy named Lee
Ramsey, who conducts a saloon on the
Mexican side of the line, was arrested by
the authorities, charged with being im
plicated in the affair, and is now in jail
at Naco with Franco.
The cowboys, since the fight, have been
gathering horses and their friends and
are heavily arming themselves, prepara
tory, it is said, to an attsrnpt to rescue
Ramsey and Franco. There are now in
this city and at points near hero and
Naco over fifty of them armed with Win
chesters and six-shooters. The Mexican
guards .ii Naco have been re-enforced by
the addition of a body of twenty-five cor
dtidos under Lieutenant Colonel Koster
litzky and they now have an armed force
of nearly a hundred men guarding the
line and the jail In which the Americans
are confined. Should the attempt at res
cue be made a most serious battle will
result, as both parties are worked up to
fever heat over the killings.
The cowboys who attacked the guards
in Sonora are well known in this city and
are here to-night, not having been placed
under arrest. Their movements are be
ing watched and they will not be allowed
to leave the country. Mexican Consul
Bavito is arranging matters at once to
have the authorities here arrest and hold
them until the proper papers can be ar
ranged for.

HONGKONG, Pept. n.â The United
i States transport Tartar has arrived here
from Manila carrying soldiers to San
Francisco to be discharged. The men j
complain bitterly of their treatment i
aboard the ship. They allege gross over- j
crowding, there being more than 1200 |
S"ld;.Â»rs on board, when, they assert,
there are accommodations for only 750.
They complain also of the ship's lilthy :
condition In consequence of overcrowding.
It is asserted by the men thut the food
is insufficient In quantity and lacks va- '
. riety. The heat is excessive and men pre
i fer to lie in unfrequented roadways rather
than on the transport.
The > onduct of the American soldiers
1 ashore has been excellent, winning high
est praise. Soldiers are fraternizing
i freely and officers are being privately en
; tertained.
WASHINGTON. Sept. 11.â No informa
, tion has been received at the War Depart
ment respecting the charges of ill treat
ment and crowding made by returning
. soldiers on the transport Tartar, now at
Hongkong. Lieutenant Charles Bird,
who has charge of transportation under
dirt ction oi Quartermaster General Lud
i ington, said the Tartar had hitherto taken
out practically the same number of men
she now has on board, and complaint of
lovercrowding had never been received. ,
â  On her last trip from San Francisco to
Manila the Tartar carried forty-five offi
> cers and 115*3 enlisted men. General Otis
loaded the ship with forty-five officers
and 1208 men belonging to the Kansas reg
iment and general service, all of whom
are returning to San Francisco for dis
charge.
When the steamer was bought the de
partment was advised that she could com
fortably accommodate more than ISM men
and the officials say they have always
: been careful to be well within this figure.
; If food is lacking in quantity or quality
department officials say the commissary
on board is responsible and he will be
called to account when the vessel reaches
San Francisco, providing the allegations
1 are substantiated.

Sept. 11. â "Now York. 2Sth. Dewey."
-This* dispatch was received this morn
ing from Admiral Dewey, Bled just be
fore his departure from Gibraltar yes
terday. As- interpreted by the de
partment officials, it means that the
Olympia will not reach New York un
til September 28, and that the eighteen
days the vessel will be at sea will be
utilized in making a slow voyage. As
the Herald stated this morning, it is
the presumption of the department that
the admiral will .follow the great circle
route, stopping at the Azores.
Washington is making treat prepara
tions lor the Itfwey cciebrailon to be
held here upon the admiral's arrival. A
number of Governors of States have in
dicated their purpose to participate in
the ceremonies, the /atest being (iov
ernor Woloott of Massachusetts. The
suggestion has been advanced, and may
be adopted, that the <J<>vern<rrs of vari-
OUs States and their staffs and any
State troops that may accompany them
be invited to act as an escort to Ad
miral Dewey to and from the Capitol on
Octo-ber 3, when lie will be presented
with the nation's sword.
In making preparations for the pre
sentation of the sword and parade the
committee has been very much assisted
by President McKinley, Secretary Long,
by prominent Senators and Represen
tatives and ranking officers of the army
and navy, all of whom are exceedingly
anxious that this national demonstra
tion shall in every respect represent
the people and be known and considered
as the expression of their voice and
wishes.
It is to this end that all who are
engaged in making the necessary ar
rangementa are working and when the
demonstration takes place it will be
found that people of every grade and
class will be represented. Particularly
true will this be of tin- parade, which
will be composed of United States
troops and naval forces, the National
Guard of the District of Columbia, mil
itary bodies from many States, Gover
nors and their stuffs, organized socie
ties in the district and colleges.
The city will be gorgeously illuminat
ed on the night of October 2 and Penn
sylvania avenue will be a blaze of fire
works. The parade will be reviewed by
Admiral Dewev and President McKin
ley. The day following will be a great
holiday for Washington and it is be

COLLECTOR MAKES TO
DEADLY THREATS
Vain Endeavor to Strangle News
paper Publicity Regarding a
Peculiar Legal TraQsactior).
SAN RAFAEL, Sept. 11.â M. F. Coughran, a local bill collector, who 4
earned considerable notoriety by withdrawing from the bonds of Henry .
Young, the alleged fire fiend of Tiburon, a day before the latter fled Â£
the country, was threatened with arrest to-day on the charge of con- jj
splracy by Attorney Charles Smythe of San Francisco. A similar threat i
was registered against Justice George Rodden, also of Young-fire-case i
fame, who already has troubles of his own in standing off Secretary Case J
of the Marin County Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. .
Coughran was given a bill of $79 05 to collect from Mrs. Helen M. <
Ournleau of Manzanita by the Harris Construction Company. A con- â¢
stable went to the house with a writ of attachment and Mrs. Martin Es- \
pinosa. the lessee, became so frightened that she borrowed the money >
from neighbors. The constable turned over the money to Coughran, j
but concluded he had made an error and asked that the money be given *
to Rodden. Instead of giving back the money Coughran gave the con- S
stable a check, which was placed in Rodden's hands. Coughran then <
had the case dismissed and the check was torn in pieces without judg- \
mt-nt being rendered.
Attorney Smythe came to town to-day and demanded the money '<
from Rodden and was told to see Coughran. He refused, saying that the i
affair was clearly illegal, that Mrs. Espinosa had been made a victim c!
of legal jugglery and that he intended to have all the parties to it ar- Â£
rested on a charge of conspiracy. Justice Rodden turned pale and .'
tremblingly replied that he was innocent of any wrong intention. C
Coughran declared to two responsible citizens this evening that he jjjj
would perforate with bullets any newspaper correspondent who dared to Â£
publish anything about the affair. One of the correspondents named by <
him said that he intends to have Coughran arrested for threats against r
life, Â§j

BUCKLEY NOT IN
THE SAN MATEO DEAL
Says He Was Never Consulted Re
garding the Proposed Incor
poration of Colma.
LIVERMORK, Sept. 11.â Christopher
A. Buckley made the following statement
to a Call representative in Livermore to
day regarding the Colma incorporation
and coursing park mat tors:
"I was much astonished to hear my
name connected with the San Matcu mat
ter. The first intimation that I had of
the incorporation of the town of Colma
was from the columns of The Call. I wh?
never consulted concerning the matter and
know nothing whatever about it. In re
lation to the coursing park at that place,
I am not in any way interested in the
project nor in any other proposition in
San Mateo County.
"My name has from time to time been
connected with propositions of this kind
in Sausalito and other places. with which
I have had nothing whatever to do. I
have always labored under the impression
that The Call is in favor of fair play and
never have known it to knowingly' take
undue advantage of any person, and 1
| feel sure that if the paper will thoroughly
investigate this matter it will be found
that I have nothing to do either directly
or indirectly with this scheme either in
San Mateo or elsewhere."

MAY COMBINE
AGAINST THE
UNITED STATES
Possible Action of Various
Republics of Central and
South America.
OFFICIALS ALARMED
Feeling of Distrust Existing: on the
Part of the Latin-Americans
Has Been Strengthened.
Special Dispatch to Thp Call.
WASHINGTON. Sept. 11.â The rumor of
possible combinations among the States
of Central and South America directed
against the United States are received
with some concern by the officials here.
Nearly a year ago ?!iis .-jiirit of distrust
on the part of the Latin-American people
was first exhibited in the semi-official dis
cussion by the press of the United States
of Colombia of a proposition to combine
the nations of South and Central America,
In that case the ostensible purpose waa
to resist unjust demands for indemnities
by foreign states. But incidentally during 1
the discussion it appeared that th.> scope
of the combination would be broader than
this, and there was more than one inti
mation of a deep-seated distrust of the
United States.
Two or three events have occurred since
that discussion to strengthen this feeling.
First there was a decision averse I
lombia in the Cerrutl case, and as Presi
dent Cleveland was the arbitrator that
unpopular decision was charged against
the United Statts. Then last spring came
the cruise of the United States gunboat
Wilmington up the Amazon and the Ori
noco. These voyages were undertaken
from the most innocent scientific and com
mercial motives. Commander Todd of the
Wilmington found that there were nc
charts of these vast rivers and conse
quently was obliged to take soundings as
he proceeded. Incidentally he was en
abled to make rough running charts of
the river that may be of value to com
merce hereafter. His actions were, haw
ever, misinterpreted by some of the na
tives, though in the end Captain Todd
is believed to have perfectly satisfied the
Brazilian officials as to the rectitude of
his purpose. It is said at the department
that there is not the slightest foundation
for the story that secret agents of either
the State or the Navy department have
been sent into South America, and it is
quite certain that there have nev. â :
any negotiations with Bolivia respecting
the acquisition by the United States of
lands in the interior of South America.
\s for the visit to that continent of Wil
liam E. Curtis Chief Clerk Michael of the
I State Department is authority for the
statement that Mr. Curtis' visit is abso
lutely without official authority or direc
tion. ___âÂ«ââ -

TRAIN ROBBERS
Posses Searching tne
Hills for Them.
Special Dispatch to The CaJl.
LOS ANGELES. Sept 11.â The west
bound Southern Pacific express which
â¢was held up and robbed near Cochlse,
Arizona, on Saturday night, hfs arrived
In this city. The express car looked as
though it had been struck by a cyclone.
All the windows and doors are smashed
and the roof has several "loles blown
through it. The floor is strewn with
broken timbers and fragments of iron
and the safe is utterly demolished.
Mall Clerk C. J. Adair, vho Is also the
baggageman, says: "On the night of Sep
tember 9. at 11 o'clock, we were just ready
to pull out of Cocblse, vhen the door of
the car was thrust open and a man with
a dirty colored mask covered me with
his rifle and yelled "Throw up your hands.'

jolly and cracked jokes all the time.
"They then told the mail clerk to un

that he did not know how, and they made
the fireman do it. As soon a? it was done
they marched us on board and ordered the
engineer to ike the express and mail

of time for their worjfa

F"e what they were doing very well on ac
count of thÂ»- darkness. After they got
through plundering the car they told us
that we had better not go away for fifteen
minutes and they started co walk bark
toward Cochise ::bout seventy-five yards
from the track. Just as they left some
<ne fired five shots. These were the only
shots that were Bred during the holdup.
S. H. Butier. local agent for a â  is-
Fargo, will not s give the exact value of
the booty tak^n by the robbers. !I- said
it amounted to only a nominal sum.
PHOENIX. Ariz.. Sept. ILâ Oeorge Scar
borough, the well-known ranger, who has
bt-en very successful In the Southwest in
running down outlaws, is on the trail of
the bandits who held up the Southern
Pacific express on Saturday night a! Co
t hise. 'â 'â  arrived at Cochise yesterday
and soon found the trail of the robbers,
lie is accompanied by his son. Constable
Alvord of Willcox and Deputy Stykcs are
also on the trail and another posse has
been organized by Sheriff Scott Whit of
Cochise County and Is in pursuit.
A special dispatch from Willcox says
that the bandits came from the Sulphur
Springs Valley and rode through 'Wiflcox
the evening of the holdup. The engineer
of the train that was held up saw two of
tho robbers, and from his description they
aro believed to belong to the Folsom gang.
One of the men described is an outlaw
mimed McOlnnls who is well known in
Southern Arizona.
The bandits crossed the alkali fiats and
went toward the Chiricahua Mountains.
The officers in pursuit are confident that
they have the right trail. Colonel Kos
terlitsky, the gendarme of Sonora, ha.Â«
been notified of the progress of the rob
bers toward Mexico and he will probably
take the trail with a squad of Mexican
cavalrymen.
BUSH NEGROES
IN BLOODY WAR
Savage Conflicts in
Guiana.
Correspondence of the Associated Press.
KINGSTON, Jamaica. Sept. s.â The
"bush negroes" of Surinam. Dutch Gui- â 
ana. have just been calling attention to
themselves, in a rather sensational exhi
bition of savagery, according to a news
paper published at Nlckerle, in that
colony. These people are to-day what
the Maroons of Jamaica were a century
or more ago. with this difference that
they are the descendants of fugitive
slaves who have completely relapsed into
*a vapory, making <;n*Â»jaba and other ter
ritories occupied by them counterparts
of Equatorial Africa.
The Dutch Government long ago con
cluded to let them alone. The trouble that
has just brought them into prominence
prow out of a fishing: dispute. Some
neighbors of the Goejaba community poi
poned the fish in a creek that appears to
have been common to both parties. The
<ioejabans thereupon went on the war
path but apparently got the worst of it,
fnr their village was burned and they lost
s-lx warriors killed and many wounded.
It is not improbable that later advices
will â ring further details of a general
scrimmage in that district:
The incident is important as furnishing
the Dutch authorities a pretext to Inter
vene and bring the natives under subjec
tion to the laws of the colony, whose
pea^e thf-y occasionally menace. As an
ethnological study, illustrating the possi
bilities of the negro when left almost en
tirely to himself, these "bush negroes'*
have perhaps not had the attention they
deserve.
DAIRYMEN IN SESSION.
Tuberculosis in Cattle the Chief Topic

this morning, about a score of dairymen

ance the morning was devoted to a gen
cr.il discussion. In which outsiders as well
as members took part
Tlip principal topic discussed was the

eradicate it. A man from Vermont made
tetnent that he was in California for
laughter's health, as she had taken
motion through drinking diseased
milk Others acknowledged the great
dence of tuberculosis in dairy stock,
while others refused to acknowledge it
and dÂ«elared that even if it were true, it
should not be discussed, on account of the
bad effect it would have on the industry.
Tt was through the efforts of R. D. Steph-
Sacramento that the discussion was
precipitated. _

CELEBRATION CLOSES
IN A BLAZE OF GLORY
Carnival on the San Lorenzo a Fitting Close to
the Grand Celebration of the Native
Sons and Daughters.
Scene at the Santa Cruz Water Carnival.
SANTA CRUZ, Sept. 11.â The cele
bration closed to-night with the
carnival on the lake. A heavy
fog rolled in early in the evening,
but the glare of myriads of in
-1 candescent iights and the blaze of fire
works dispelled every vestige of it. F^r
! I the three hours following S o'clock the
: '< improvised lake was wrapped in a fiery
] canopy. Thousands of people wit'
the fete and every p int of vantage was
occupied.
As a spectacle this year's carnival
exceeded those of ivm and 1896. There
was lacking, of course, the thous
who were in attendance at those events,
but from a standpoint of iloats and
fireworks and tinkling cymbals the
record established four years ago was
cracked beyond recognition 7 . It wa
an event of tinkling cymbals, however,
but of sounding brass and booming
mortars from the time Queen May and
her suite went aboard the royal barge
to the time they came off and the last
j light was extinguished. The lagunita
itself was a dream of fairy land and
I a marvel of art and any one of a half
j dozen other good old similes that the
pioneers made use of before th>> birth
of the first native son was heralded, i
The picturesque San Lorenzo was
stopped in its course by a dam that
took hundreds of dollars out of the
pockets of the citizens of Santa Cruz.
It broke once or twice this year, bul
was in good working order to-night and
the hundred and odd gayly decorated
boats that gave color to thÂ» scene had
all the water they needed to sail in.
Nearly every prominent citizen of the
city had a float or a boat on the lake.
San Francisco was represented in the
pageant by Sequoia Parlor of ;he Na
tive Sons and the Modern and Inde
-1 pendent Order of Lobsters. The deco
rations of the Lobster tiny were, to
say the least, unique. The association
had a number of San Francisco Eagles
as its guests and the craft and the
whole menage were in command of
Grand Exalted Ah^o Thomas Eckert.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 12, 1899.
It was just 8:30 o'clock when Hast
ings' Band struck up the National
anthem and a royal salute was given by
a battery of mortars across the river
from the tribunes. It was a signal to
the populace that Queen May was about
to board the float of honor, attended
by her maids, and the populace stood on
its Beats or in tiptoe to see the open
ing event.
By an ingenious arrangement the
royal barge was lighted with electric
lights. They were concealed in the
canopy over the royal head and the
footstool under the royal feet; they
were stuck in below the water line and
abc-ve it and concealed among the
great pots of tropical plants. Under
the canopy sat the queen in the person
of .Miss May Baldwin. She was at
tended by Miss Stella Finkeldey. Miss
Adele Bennett. Miss Alice Culvenrell
and Miss Annie Linscott as maids of
honor. As the barge sailed down the
river the band played "God Save the
i." while hundreds of rockets
were sent up.
The line of march was taken up In
the direction of the beach. It extended
to the dam and back to a point oppo
site the northern end of the tribunes
One by one the bigger barges fell into
line in oTder of their size and In shorter
time than it takes to tell it every barge
boat and canoe on the lagoon had got
ten into the parade and was busy un
corking colored fires and Roman
candles. The battery of fireworks <-n
the other side of the lake turned loose
and for two hours there was no need for
electric lights or lanterns or anything
else. Bursting bombs and rockets split
through the fog blanket and showered
stars over everything. A good sec
tion of the audience had come well pro
vided with fireworks of its own and a
bombardment was begun between the
b..ats and shore. Everybody joined In
the excitement and everybody cheered
the queen and her suite and everybody
else until a final fusillade from the Â«tar
batteries sent royalty ashore and sig
nal, d for lights out B
San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose
did not provide any great portion of
the audience. Those of the six or eight
thousand who were there were towns
people or from the sugar beet sections
uatsonville and Salinas. Cal Ewing

\V. Pioda, Ralph Thompson and a
i dozen others of those who generally
I get behind things down here and push
; them through. Therf was no hitch in
it of any sort, and it made a fitting
and brilliant end to this year's celebra
j tion.
The day has been a lively one from
I the time Ralph Miller opened up the
! clambake at the beach this morning
and let ten or eleven hundred people
1 in to eat mussels and baked corn and
drink beer. Fifty thousand and odd
juicy mussels gathered from the rocks
around Monterey were thrown into
thre^ brick-lined pits and there cooked
until their shells popped. For three
hours during the morning and two
; more to-night they were served up pip
ing hot.
In the afternoon Cal Ewing's con
stellation of baseball stars handed out
to the Santa Cruz Sand Crabs a few
more tips on how to find a pitcher. The
score was 3 to 2 in favor of the Oak
landers; not so fierce a session as yes
terday, when Ewing's men turned out a
, score of 19 to 3, but had enough to
; make the Crabs feel like lobsters. Tho

DARING DAYLIGHT
BURGLARY AT REDDING
Thieves Enter and Ransack a House
and Carry Off Their
Plunder.
REDDING. Sept. 11. -The first bure
lary In Redding for a great length of time
occurred Monday afternoon at the hnmo
of Charles K. Penner. It is centrally
located and surrounded by residences.
While the family was absent burglars
gained an entrance by forcing a window
and ransacked the house. They tonk
four suits of Mr. Penner's clothing one
of thorn being his wedding suit An over
coat, shoes, hat and a valise full of na
pers valuable only to the owner were
among the numerous articles stolen How
the burglars escaped with all their
plunder in broad daylight is a wonder to
the officers who are working on the case.
JUSTICE'S JURISDICTION.
Superior Court Decides He May In
flict Heavy Penalties.
REDDING, Sept. 11.â That a Justice of
the Peace in this county has a rig-ht to
impose a fine of $50) or in lieu thereof
imprisonment of 800 days has been de
cided in the affirmative by Superior
Judge Edward Sweeny. The decision
grew out of the case of Dan Stofer.
Stofer pleaded guilty before Justice W.
E. Herzinger of cruelty to animals. His
was an aggravated case and the Justice
Imposed the sentence named. The
severity of the sentence attracted con
siderable attention.
Through his attorney Stofer applied for
a writ of habeas corpus on the ground
that the Justice had exceeded his juris
diction in imposing a sentence of 500
days' imprisonment, the contention be
ing that a Justice of the Peace could im
pose a term of Imprisonment no greater
than 180 days. Judge Edward Sweeny
denied, the writ Monaay.

land on the Case.
Special Dispatch to The CaJl.
SAN JOSE. Sept. 11.â Medical Director
Sr.onogle is again ousted from the man
agement of Agnewa Insane Asylum. This
time it is on a decision rendered by Judge
Hyland on a writ of review asked by Sen
ator H. V. Morehouse, counsel for Dr.
Sponogle, on the proceedings of the board
of managers, whereby Sponogle was re
moved at a mooting on August 23 last at
the Palace Hotel.
Dr, Sponogle refused to quit and a writ
of review and temporary Injunction were
secured. He claimed the board had no
power to discharge nini without a hear
ing, and that he bad been elected for four
years. Dr. Stocking, the first assistant
physician, was placed temporarily in
charge, hut on aavice of Attorney Gen
eral Ford he gave the keys over to Dr.
Sponogie until the matter in court shouid
be settled.
Judge Hyland's decision covered all the
points raised, and cited numerous deci
sions by ill" Supreme Court to sustain his
decision, which in point is as follows:
That the term of office of the plaintiff as
medical superintendent of the Agnewa State
Hospltai v. .-i I by the constitution of
this Sun--, nor declared by law; that the plain
tiff's term of office continued only during the
pleasur ard of managers of said hos
pital, and that they had jurisdiction and au
thority u> remove him from his position as
medical superintendent.
The ; - of the defendants in relation
to the matters at issue herein are affirmed.
The order hereinbefore made restraining de
fendants from proceeding further with the
matters reviewed, or in any way interfering
with plaintiff a* medical superintendent of said
ApnewF State Hospital, is set asi.i>-.
Let a formal judgment be prepared and en
tered accordingly.
When the matter was decided Chairman
Curnow of the board of managers at once
telegraphed to Dr. J. H. Crane at Ala
meda, who was chosen as a successor to
Sponogli-, to come down and assume con
trol of the institution.
There promises to be further trouble
when Crane arrives. Sponogle declares
he will not allow Crane to enter the build
ing, his attorney having advised him to
hold the fort.
An appeal will be taken to the Supreme
Court and a stay in the proceedings
asked. Senator Morehouse is confident
thnt Sponogle will win, and a long legal
battle must be fought before Sponogle is
finally ousted.

A SURPRISE AT
SACRAMENTO
Promising Colt Wins the Califor
nia Annual Stake in Good Time,
Toying With His Field.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 11.â Close, murky
weather, a large attendance and some ex
cellent sport characterized the seventh
day of the meet at Agricultural Park.
Notwithstanding that Dr. Frasse's Sister,
Psyche, Monrovia and February, all pro
nounced choices in the betting, came
home in front, the books enjoyed a win
ning day. The win of the California An
nual stake by San Tomas, which prom
ising coil toyed with his field, was about
the biggest surprise of the afternoon.
The Stanford stake, trotting, for foals
of 16%, did not furnish much of a con
test, Dr. Frasse'e Sister winning in
straight heats. The game filly, driven by
Bunch) and a stanch choice both in the
auction pooling as well as in the books,
had but one actual competitor, the big
11 own colt Direct Heir, piloted by Walter
Maben. In the final heat the lilly tired
Âui)y the last eighth of a mile, but Direct
Heir was himself so groggy that he broke
ipposite the paddock, losing whatever
â nance he had of snatching victory. Ele
vator, Loe Hoy and '1 ia Juana finished
third, fourth and fifth, respectively, in
..ten of the heats trotted.
Prior to' the race the winner and also
Direct lieir were protested. The former

boys are to have a percentage of the
"picture privileges" in addition to the
purse of $10,000, of which $7f>oo goes to the

AN IMPRESSIVE PROCESSION

HONOR THEM.
At the National Cemetery and Also
Upon the Streets Many Thou
sands of Spectators Were
Gathered.
The remains of two California heroe*,
Captain Reinhold Richter and Sergeant
Maurice Justh of the First California
Volunteers, were placed under the sod of
the National Cemetery at the Presidio
yesterday afternoon. All that martial
pomp, sweet music, earnest and tender
"W'-rds and the assurance of the sympathy
of myriads of surviving companions at
arms could lend to alleviate the deep sor
rowfl of the mourners were there at the
grave side. Thousands of sympathizing
citizens lined the struts through which
the double funeral procession passed.
Many eyes were wet with tears. The
P"lu:.r.-s of Minnesota Joined with the sol
diers ot California to do honor to the dead
As the line marched in solemn
mood through Van Ness avenue little
children rais.d a cry that might have
sounded discordantly in the ears of the
I rners under any other circumstant-'.p.
"Hurrah for th-- soldiers!" cried several,
rs for the â  â ; 1 as the living!
Why not. Had they not won the plaudits
of their countrymen? Plaudits that sfhall

a year?
It was about 2 o'clock when the pro
cession escorted the two caskets enfold
ing the remains of Captain Richter and
:;it Justh out of Mission into Fifth
.-r<iwd of spectators
numbered thousands. Along Fifth street
to Market they stretched. When the line
â  \ Market street and turned west
ward the curbs on both *i>ies of Market
street for many blocks were lined. Men
with uncovered heads while the
caskets passed by. Women looked serl-
I i Bad. At Gulden Gate avenue, out
which the funeral procession moved
from Mark'-t street, another crowd had
gathered. No funeral in years has at
same amount of attention.
All along the entire !in^ of march marks
of sympathy and respect were bestowed.
There were no funeral services at the
irlora at 946 Mission street.
The mourners and their friends gathered
[1 had been arranged that the final
should ;ak'' place at the cemetery.
T< nderly and with exceeding care, while

stood with heads bared. Then the pro

were to conduct the services at the grave
Fide, came next in a carriage. Serious of
mien and treading slowly, the first of the
Mini- Company I of the Thir

Then the caisson wheels rumbled and

Once or twice a year the good house-
wife has a thorough house cleaning. The
house has been swept and dusted every
day in the year, but the housewife knows
that in spite of vigilance dust accumu-
lates in cracks and corners, and is only
to be removed by special effort.
It's the same way with the body. You
look after it every day. You take all
the ordinary precautions of cleanliness
health. Yet the body needs its
special cleaning to rid it of the accumu-
lations of waste and poisonous matter
which invite disease. Doctor Pierces
GoMen Medical Discovery, taken regu-
larly once or twice a year, would save
many a sickness. It purifies the blood,
strengthens the stomach, and cleanses
the body of poisonous accumulations.

MINNESOTA'S EXECUTIVE
ARRIVES WITH HIS STAFF
GOVERNOR JOHN LIND, WHO CAME TO MEET HIS TROOPS
GOVERNOR JOHN LIND of Minnesota, who loft his home with the J 1
intention of being here to welcome the troops from his State upon their ji
return from the Philippines, has at last arrived and is quartered at the
Occidental with the members of his staff. ,
The party arrived from the north this morning and were met by a *
delegation of their own people and escorted to the hotel. There another lot 8?
of officers from the Minnesota regiment had congregated and the Governor's JJ
appearance was the signal for a greeting which was an ovation. Shortly gj
after a magnificent breakfast was served and everybody sat down to discuss "
the good things and the good news that each had to communicate to
the other. *"
When seen yesterday and questioned as to the plans that had been Â£
proposed for the entertainment of the volunteers Governor Llnd said that gj
beyond free transportation home nothing definite had been decided upon.
That the men would be overwhelmed with courtesy at Minneapolis and St.
Paul and given at both places receptions which would live forever in the *
history of the State was a foregone conclusion, and the money necessary to 8?
carry these pageants to success had already been collected. But thu smaller JJ
details and minor particulars had yet to be drawn up. gj
Business permitting. President McKinley will be present at both functions, j.
There are about 150 students of the Minnesota State University in the "
regiment, and these men will be presented with medals by the university *<
commemorative of the sacrifices they have made for their flag. Possibly g<
the State, at the next meeting of the Legislature, will make provision for
a State medal to be given to every man who enlisted for the war with Spain.
Those with the Governor are: Generals George Lambert, Gustave Schoole, â¢<
Gjertsen and I.udwig, Colonels Hartley, Stanton, Hawthorne, Hawkins, S"
Bergmeir, Paulle. Bobleter and Van DrylL Beside these gentlemen there g>
are a number of ladies in the party, including the wife and daughter of the g<
Governor and a long list of civilians, relatives and friends of the soldiers Ci
and a number of newspaper men. ' t
Dickinson, namely, Colonels Cluff, Milea,
Barere and Huber.
The line of march was along Fifth street
to Market, to Golden Gate avenue, to Van
Ness avenue, and Lombard street to the
Presidio. On Van Ness avenue the cais
sons and the companies of Californians ,
were in two lines. At the Lombard-street
gate of the Presidio were gathered many
of the officers and men of the First Cali
fornia Regiment. The band of another |
regiment was just then playing a lively !
tune in the Presidio and cheers were
heard, but the sounds were hushed quick
ly. The dirge of the First California band
succeeded the rolling of the drums as the
procession moved sadly on to the ceme
tery
There were thousands of spectators
gathered around the riewly opened graves.
On the burial plats stocxl mute evidences j
of the love and memory of comrades and
friends of the fallen. A huge floral de
vice stood by the open grave of Captain
KJohter It told its own story in these
words: "Our beloved captain, First Cali
fornia Volunteers. At rest." Other de
vices were also there. By the grave of
Sergeant Justh were several floral de
vices. Two of these were American flags,
one from the company to which Sergeant
Justh belonged and the other from the
Foresters. On one were the words: "Rest,
brave Maurice." On the other was the
inscription, "Brave Maurice Justh."
The band led the way into the space
in which is the grave of Captain Richter. \
His official and other comrades and the
firing squad of the Thirteenth Minnesota
Volunteers followed. A great crowd i
pressed forward and gazed upon the
spectacle. The firing squad was at the |
east of the grave. The comrades of Cap- i
tain Richter were ranged around the sides ,
of a large inclosure described by the lines
of spectators. When the casket was taken
to the edge of the grave, followed by I
Mrs. Richter and her little family, the I
band played softly, "Nearer, My God, to
Thee." The services were very simple.
There was no eulogy. Rev. Charles M.
Daley, chaplain of the First South Da
kota Volunteers, read some passages of
Scripture:
"If Christ be not risen," he said, "then
your faith is in vain. If Christ be not ,
raised ye are not raised. There is a j
natural body and a spiritual body.- Behold
I show you a miracle." So he read on,
repeating the words that have given com
fort to k<> many at the brink of the grave.
The casket having been lowered, the
soldiers took their part in the services.
Thrice the firing squad volleyed across
the dead captain's grave. When the echoes
had died away 11. C. Pavson, the trum
peter of the old company in tho California
National Guard to which Captain Richter
belonged, now a bugler in the First Cali- j
fornia Volunteers, raised his bugle and
"taps" sounded, sweetly and pathetically
The mourners turned from the grave and
services were over.
At the National Cemetery the casket
containing the remains of Sergeant
Maurice Justh was lifted from its position
on the caisson and the pall bearers with
solemn tread moved toward Its last rest-
Ing place. Following in the wake of the
remains came Rabbi M. S. Levy, Mr. and
Mrs. H. Wehser; "William Wehser, Ser
geant of Company E, First California
Volunteers; George A. Lazar, United
States Navy, and G. Wehser, the only rel
atives? of the dead soldier in this part of
the country. Following them were the
members of Court Palo Alta. Foresters
of America, and the firing squad of four
teen men from Company A. Thirteenth
Minnesota Volunteers. Numerous friends
and spectators crowded around the grave
to witness tho ceremonies.
The casket was deposited on some sup
ports above the grave. Chief Ranger L,
J. Pinkson of Court Palo Alto read the
beautiful funeral service of the order and
on concluding "With the leaves of the
forest we leave you," deposited an ever
green on the lid of the coffin.
Dr Levy then took up his position .it
the head of the grave and solemnly read
the nineteenth Psalm. At the conclusion
of the reading, the rabbi delivered a
touching eulogy on the heroic soldier
whom he personally knew in life and to
whom he paid a beautiful tribute in
death Above the quiet of the cemetery
rose the voice of the speaker and as his
Ploouent and pathetic words of praise
were heard by those surrounding the
crave many wept. Dr. Levy took for hia
text ""O Lord, what is man that thou
nre mindful of him? and the son of man,
fhat thou visited him?" From this text
v,Â«Â» addressed the assembled multitude.
'â¢Comrades, citizens and friends." he
Mntd "the painful task has been assigned
tn me of committing the moral remains
r,f our departed comrade, Maurice Justh,
?o the earth whence It came. Be
fnrm doing so. I consider it my privilege
to- sneak of the loyalty and sincerity of
â¦ his young man's life, commencing with
i'^ime he joined the army, of the faith

been reared so large a percentage of those

to be found in the First California Vol
unteers. The lesson of early youth, im
parted by his parents, to love the land
of his birth and to seek the welfare of
the land whither he might go, was beau
tifully illustrated in his response to the
call to armsâ he having left a most lucra
tive position to take up his future in the
rank and file of army life.
"As a soldier he was brave, courageous,
loyal; in commercial life he was honest
and truthful and In domestic life compan
ionable, modest and loving. All these
traits were prominent in his character,
for which he was admired, honored and
respected."
The doctor referred to the deceased's
great love for soldier life, and of his oft
exprpssed wish prior to his leaving for
the Philippines, and while at the Philip
pines, that if he should die he be gi%'en
a soldier burial.
"In obedience to that expressed wish."
continued the doctor, "we have brought
him to the National Cemetery to-day,
where there is no distinction between Jew
and Gentile; where burial is given to the
honored dead of the nation.
' "You who are still in life may take
from the life and death of Maurice Justh
a lesson strongly to heart. Liove your
country with all your soul, with all your
heart and serve it under all conditions.
Be ready to give up your life as he the
first of the California Regiment gave up
his life in the service of the country that
he loved so dearly. You may still further
take to heart the great lesson of life that
when you die some noble deed, some good
thought, some loving action of loyalty to
the country In which you live may be left
behind in this world; that the world may
see Ihat it is not an idle boast that deeds
nre greater than words, action greater
than creeds. Because in this cemetery
the nation knows no creed. She only
cares for the man who will serve her
when she nerds his service, and he should
be as loyal and honest and noble to the
cause a-s was the life and death of
Maurice Justh."
The rabbi then concluded with a prayer
for the repose of his soul, that he might
be "bound in the bundle of eternal life,"
that God might be his inheritance and
paradise his reward. This the rabbi fol
lowed by reciting the committal service:
"For dust thou art and unto dust thou
must return, the body shall be given to
the earth from whence it came, the .spirit
shall return to God who gave It. Sleep in
peace, honored, beloved of the Lord."
The speaker then threw three handfuls
of earth on the coffin as it was lowered
Into the grave and then repeated
"Kadish." the solemn and beautiful
burial prayer of the Jew. The members
of Company A fired three volleys over the
grave and then "taps" was sounded uy
Regimental Bugler J. Aitken, and the
services were ended.
Among the handsome floral pieces at
the grave were two American nags, one
the tokpn of Court Palo Alto and the
other from the employes of Meyerstein ot
Co., where the deceased was employed

15th Inst. and October 2, so there will be
busy times in the quartermaster 8 de
partment from now on. The Belgian
.King will lead the way. She is expected
to sail on Friday next with thirty-four
officers and 900 men. She will be fol
lowed on Saturday by the Aztec and the
Relief. The number of soldiers that the
Aztec is to take has not been decided
upon, but the Relief will not carry pas
sengers. On her arrival at Manila she
will be used as a hospital ship, taking
the convalescing men for short cruises
out to sea in order to fit them for the
voyage home.
On September IS the Grant will go out
with seventy-three officers and 1836 men.
and the next day the Centennial sails
with two officers and thirty-six men and
700 hon-es. The Tacoma with thirty-one
officers and 786 men will also go out on
the 19th inst., and on the 20th the George
W. Elder and the Sikh are expected to get
away. The Elder will Ake forty-six of
ficers and 612 men, and the Sikh twenty
five officers and 700 men.
On September 21 the Sherman and the
City of Rio de Janeiro are expected to ge.t
away. The Rio only got in from the
Orient on Sunday last, and in order to
get her away on the 21st inst, the worl"
of transforming her into a transport will
have to be rushed. Troops have not been
assigned to either of these vessels, but
the Sheridan, which is expected to get
away on September 24, will take sixty
eight officers and 1842 men. After that the
Glenogle will sail on the 27th, the Va
lencia and Charles Nelson on the 2Sth,

Nevada cavalry. The Wyefleld, Conne
maiitfh. Indiana and City of Para are still
at Manila, the Ohio is on her way to
Nagasaki to bring on the troops which

WORK FOR VOLUNTEERS
Committee Will Soon Begin
Systematic Action.
The soldiers' employment committee
j met yesterday afternoon at the headquar
ters tent and accomplished considerable
business.
C. S. Haley of Heald's Business College
offered twenty-five free scholarships to
the most worthy and physically incapac
itated of the discharged California Vol
unteers, the committee being the trib
unal which is to pass judgment and make
i the selection. The employment committee
j to a man was in favor of accepting the
offer and will recommend such action to
the executive -committee.
The committee recommended that Miss
'Garlic, the Red Cross nurse of the regi
! ment, be recompensed for her charitable
and benevolent services. If the execu
tive committee agrees she will rcelve $250,
which sum will go to the equipment nec
essary to carry on her profession as
j nurse.
At the camp to-day Colonel Duboce will
| issue a circular to all the companies re
! questing men wanting employment to
make known the fact. Books will then
be made out and the committee will be
gin systematic labors for the securing of
employment for the discharged men.
The following circular will be sent to
the retail buyers who come to San Fran
cisco for the purpose of purchasing goods
and supplies for country business:
Dear Sirâ We are advised by the Manufactur
ers' and Wholesalers' League of your arrival
In this cl<y. and take the earliest opportun
ity to ask your earnest (â¢â¢-operation and abie
assistance in procuring situations for the re
j turned California volunteers.
! These young men arrived from the Philip
j pines en August 23, and will be mustered out
! of the United States service on the 21st day
jof this month. Most of them enlisted in this
| city, but some came from nearly every county
In the State, and also from Nevada, Utah,
Idaho, Arizona and Montana. We are, there
fore, gratified to have this opportunity of ask
ing every merchant coming to this city under
the auspices of the Manufacturers' and Whole
i salers' League to assist in putting these S"!<!i-r
| boys into prosperous positions as Boon as they
| are discharged.
All applications for heir filed with our sec
retary at I'nlon Square tent, or with any mem
ber of this committee, will have careful and,
we hope, satisfactory attention. Our supply
of help coming from the California volunteers
is made up of laboring men, mechanics of
every trade nnd young men schooled in every
branch of business and professional life.
Should you or any of your friends be able
to give employment to one or more of these
splendid younK fellows who have shown their
mettle In their country's cau.^e, we believe
you will find your reward In the faithful serv
ice as well as the gratitude of every soldier
to whom you lend a helping hand. Yours very
truly. A. M. LAWRENCE, Chairman.

Company M of the National Guard will

Page-street Armory in honor of Company
M, First California Volunteers. A splen
did programme of vocal and instrumental
i selections is now being prepared and re
i freshments will be served in abundance.
! A good time is assured to all who attend.
â  The details of the affair were decided on
:at a meeting .icld last night in Page
street Armory.

j ing untiringly to insure the success of the
I entertainment: George Ferris, M.
O'Keefe. I. Crosthwaite, Harry Spillman,
George Buhlinger, J. Tyson, \V. Muentner,

j ing has been called for Wednesday night
I to make final arrangements.
TROOPS WILL BE
PLENTIFUL FOR
SOME MONTHS
Six More Regiments
on Their Way.
RECEPTION TO GOVERNOR LIND
MINNESOTA CAMP DECKED IN
GALA ATTIRE.
Changes Among the Officers of the
Various Commands at the
Presidio â Camp
Notes.
The last of the Thirtieth Infantry ar
rived at the Presidio yesterday morning,
and the whole regiment has gone into
camp in the old recruit quarters on the
hill near the Pacific-street entrance to
the post. The Thirtieth -will not remain
long, for it is booked to sail for Manila
on the transport Sherman, which is to
leave September 21. It was the intention
to send the Sherman away on the loth,
but repairs have delayed her until the
21st, and the Thirty-first Regiment, which
was to have sailed on the Sherman, has
been assigned to the Grant, which will
leave September 18. The Twenty-seventh,
which is also awaiting transportation, will
be divided between the steamer Tacoma
and the George W. Elder. The Tacoma
will sail on the 19th inst. and the Elder on
the 20th.
This would clear the Presidio of west
bound troops were it not for the fact that
the Twenty-sixth Infantry and the Thirty
third are now on their way here, and the
work of recruiting the battalion of the
Fortieth Infantry to be organized here
will begin in a few days. After that will
come the first of the new regiments to be
formed, so there will be no lack of troops
for some time to come.
The loss from the fire in the officers
quarters on Saturday morning has been
estimated at about $10, (JW. A board of
investigation consisting of Captain West
(Sixth Cavalry), Captain Bennett (Third
Artillery) and First. Lieutenant Gardener
(Third Artillery), has been assigned to
the case; but so far it has not been able
to discover what was the cause of the
fire. The flames started in a set of quar
ters which were unoccupied. It was dis
covered by one of the servants in the ad
joining quarters, who saw smoke curling
up from the empty rooms. The building
destroyed cannot be replaced for less than
$12,<X10, and there were repairs recently
made which cost $5000.
There was great excitement at the camp
of the Minnesota men yesterday after
noon. The committee of citizens of Min
nesota, now here to oversee the welcome
of the troops, decked itself out in its
badges and escorted Governor L.md out
to the Presidio, where he was received by
the regiment with a characteristic wel
come. With the Governor were several
members of his staff, besides General
Keeves and Mayor Gray of Minneapolis.
The regimental band was called up be
fore the headquarters and between sere
nades the members of the party were
asked to speak. Among those who re
ceived cheers was Colonel Ames, com
manding the regiment, and he was given
a double quantity before the men would
agree t<> quit.
Robert Lane, a recruit, who has been
in the hospital for some time, died yes
terday His trouble was bronchial asthma.
The et'le.ts of Lynn Carroll, Company
X, of the Minnesota regiment, were de
stroyed by the hospital authorities yes
terday. Carroll is now in the hospital
suffering from diphtheria. He was re
ceived Sunday, and yesterday morning
the hospital people sought out the tent
where he had been quartered, and taking
out all the effects they burned them. The
tent also will be destroyed unless, in the
judgment of the surgeons, there can be
found a means of thoroughly disinfect
ing it.
Surgeon Captain Isaac P. Ware, now
awaiting the decision of the retiring
hoard that has considered his case, has
been relieved from duty at the Presidio
and has been ordered to proceed to Beni
cla Barracks to await the outcome of
the hoard's investigations. The reason
for the order is that quarters are scarce
at the Presidio, particularly since the fire,
and the quarters now occupied by Ware
are needed by officers who are on duty.
Ware has been doing no duty since the
board was calTed to consider his retire
ment.
Captain Walter B. Elliott, Fortieth In
fantry, has been ordered to proceed to the
Presidio to assist in the organization of
the battalion of the Fortieth to be re
cruited there. Captain James J. Mayes
and Captain James C. France of the
Fortieth have also been ordered to the
same duty.
Acting Assistant Surgeon Andy Hall
has been assigned to duty aboard the
transport Aztec. Acting Assistant Sur
geon P. S. Kellogg has been assigned to
the transport Centennial.

The members of Company A, First Cali
fornia Volunteers, will be entertained at
a banquet next Saturday night at the Cen
tral Dining Rooms on Ellis street. The
hosts will be the members of former com
panies A and E of the Third Regiment,
N. G. C, better known as the Emmet and
Wolfe Tone Guards.
At a meeting held last night in the Page
street Armory with Captain Robert
Cleary presiding, it was decided to issue
Invitations to Mayor Phelan, Senator
Perkins, Congressman Kahn, Colonel Du
boce, Colonel Charles Quinn and Colonel
J c O'Connor. The three Red Cross
nurses who returned with the regiment

committee having the affair in charge.

night to make final arrangements.

THE NEW GRAND JURY.
\ MTH the impanelment of a new Grand Jury
\ \ / there ence more revives a hope on the part of
â  * the people that corruption in office will be
bare, dishonesty exposed and the wrongdoers
indicted, prosecuted and convicted. Such
hopes arise with each successive Grand Jury, and
te the frequent disappointments of the past they
sanguine and earnestly expectant.
It i- the belief of the people that sooner or later we
have a Grand Jury that will not be easily turned
by seeming difficulties in the way of obtaining
legal evidence to convict guilty officials of whose
there is a moral certainty. When cor
ruptioti becomes so open and notorious as to be the
â  I common talk, there must be some way of
to light the facts of the case and proving
in a court of justice. When bribery, the sale of
age, unlawful collusion between offi
ders for municipal contracts and other
forms of malfeasance in office become intolerable, the
mand action on the part of the law officers
ppression of the* wrong and the punishment
(Tenders. Such a condition prevails in San Fran
time, and it is for that reason the im
the new Grand Jury is noted with satis
m.
The late Grand Jury retired from office after filing
a report in which it was stated the members were
lly certain of the prevalence of corrupt practices
in s trtments of the municipal and county
nistration, but were unable to obtain evidence to
C< nvict any one. It was a good Grand Jury, but it
did nothing. The people now expect to find in the
new panei a good Grand Jury that will do a great deal.
It may be difficult to get evidence against rascals, but
it is not impossible. No band of official knaves was
ever so cunning as to be able to completely conceal
Frauds., Corrupt officials have been
convicted again and again in other cities under vir
. the same laws as ours, and what has been done
I ere can be done here. /
The Call has already set before the new Grand
Jurj a matter which demands its investigation. It has
pointed out that Dr. H. E. Gedge. chairman of the
ply committee of the School Board, has informed
at least one reputable citizen that he received $2000
for permitting the specifications for bids for school
supplies to be changed in the interest of a particular
firm, and has also said that of the sum received he
to his fello-.v-committeeman, J. J. Conlon,
who. he alleges, agreed to the fraud and was a party
tr, it. Thf protnpi investigation of that case is im
peral t Â»ould appear that evidence sufficient
t<. convict in a court of justice can be obtained if the
Grand Jury unflinchingly and pcrseveringly seek it,
regardless of any consequences save those of justice.
We cite that c.sc because it is now a part of the
current news of the day. It does not stand alone.
The late < 'â rarvi Jury claimed to have been morally
certain of guilt elsewhere, but could find no legal evi
dence. It is the duty of the new Grand Jury to seek
that evidence. Something more than a general re
port of condemnation and expressions of moral cer
tainty are expected of the present body. The people
demand that something be done.

LINCOLN ON MONARCHY.
IN his speech in this city Mr. Bryan took pains to
introduce himself to the party Mahatmas present
as the reincarnation of Jefferson and Lincoln. He
represented the Republicans as celebrating the birth
day of Thomas Jefferson, in Boston in 185Q, and
Lincoln writing them a letter in which he said the
Republican party believed in the m:tn above the dol
! lar. The anti-slavery people of Boston did celebrate
Jefferson's birthday in 1859. in honor of Jefferson's
I opposition to slavery, discussing which he had said:
"I tremble for my country when I remember that
God is just." Lincoln discussed the ownership of
man as a chattel slave for the profit of his labor. The !
dollar was the coin that bought human flesh and com
pelted the toil of slaves who had no share in the
wealth they produced.
Continuing Mr. Bryan said: "That was the doc
trine of Lincoln, and in the early days of his ad- :
ministration he sent to Congress a message, and in j
that message he warned his countrymen against the ;
approach of monarchy. What alarmed him, he stated
in that message, was the attempt to put capital upon
an equal footing if not above labor in the structure j
of the Government and in that he saw the danger of â 
! returning monarchy." Nothing can better serve to j
; illustrate either Mr. Bryan's carelessness of facts or
I his intellectual dishonesty than this juggled quota
tion from Lincoln.
In his first regular message to Congress, delivered j
! December 3, 1801. Mr. Lincoln discussed the origin of ,
I the rebellion and the state of the military operations H
I had forced upon 'the Government, and then entered ,
j upon an examination of certain principles involved :
J and the difference between the tendencies exhibited by :
j the people of the South and those of the North. Upon ,
this he said: "It continues to develop that the insur- '
i rection is largely, if not exclusively, a war upon the ;
first principles of popular governmentâ the rights of ;
' the people. Conclusive evidence of this is found in \
I the most grave and maturely considered public docu
ments as well as in the general tone of the insurgents. 1
In those documents we find the abridgment of the ;
existing right of suffrage and the denial to the people
all rights to participate in the selection of public
officers except the legislative boldly advocated, with
labored arguments to prove that large control of
the people in government is the source of all political
evil. Monarchy itself is sometimes hinted at as a pos- !
sible refuge from the power of the people. In my
present position I could scarcely be justified were I to
omit raising a warning voice against this approach
of returning of despotism." Then followed a di?
cussion of the origin of this symptom observed by
j Lincoln as existing in the Southern Confederacy.
{ which he found in the desire of the slave-holding
States to have the dollar own the man.
Now, what must one think of Mr. Bryan's honesty
in the light of his misrepresentation of Lincoln? It
was in the South, among the present supporters of
Mr. Bryan, without whom he could not have reached
the nomination in 1896 and cannot reach it again, that
1 Mr. Lincoln found signs of the approach of mon- â 
archy. Bryan drew a considerable part of his speech 'â¢â 
from this palpable misstatement. Lincoln was draw
ing attention to a condition developed in the Demo
cratic States of the South, then in rebellion against j
the Union, where a monarchical spirit had been fos- j
tered by the ownership of chattel slaves. He made no
reference to the North nor to any tendency in the free :
i States, where labor owned itself and its earnings. Yet
1 Mr. Bryan represents him as "warning his country- !
j men against the approach of monarchy, and fright
ened at the attempt then in its inception to place
capital upon an equal footing with labor in the struc
ture of the Government!"
The only government Lincoln had in mind was the
rebel government, founded on slavery, dedicated to i
the ownership of man by the dollar, in which there j
i should be no free labor. Against that government !
and its structure Mr. Lincoln was making war, and
he continued to its overthrow. Its hosts were over
thrown, its hopes defeated, its purposes destroyed and
those who cherished them were scattered, to make
their next rally in support of Mr. Bryan. They con
j tinue to declare that their cause, characterized by Mr.
Lincoln in 1861 as the return of monarchy, was a just
cause, and they seem to select Mr. Bryan as its latest
representative.
Every thoughtful man sees that if Mr. Bryan had I
quoted Mr. Lincoln truthfully, and had let his audi- \
ence know that the message named the Southern '
Confederacy as the seat of avowed monarchical ten
dencies, a considerable part of his speech would :
I have been hissed instead of cheered by his audience,
which was not one to listen patiently to what it would
have considered abuse of the late Confederacy.
If there is any value in what Lincoln said it is in
the fact that he warned the country of an attempt of
the Democratic party in the South to expel the people
from power and establish a monarchy.
The misuse made of it by Mr. Bryan is therefore '
dishonest to a degree that impeaches his morality and
I marks him an unsafe public teacher and a trcky
j leader.

Enthusiastic New Yorkers intend to petition the
French Government to pardon Dreyfus. If any no
i tice is taken of the petition it will probably be that the
French Government is quite able and perfectly satis
fied to attend to its own affairs.

says France changes her Cabinets as we take off and
I put on our coats. The distinguished Frenchman must

BOYCOTTING FRANCE.
THE Dreyfus verdict has a momentary effect
disastrous to France. The whole world ha;
been lured and enchanted by the preparations
made for the great industrial exposition set for next
year in Paris. It has been planned on a more ex
tensive scale than heretofore known. France had de
termined that it should not only be an exposition of
the world's progress in industry, science, art and
knowledge, up to date, but should be such a spectacle
as to invite to Paris millions of money-spending
visitors. No nation understands spectacular art and
its value as thoroughly as France, and she has coined
profits out of it, not only on the occasion of these
great expositions, but by continuous attention to the
creation of every charm that can attract the stranger.
Whether this feature in the Parisian exposition de
tracts from its economic value or not, it serves its in
tended purpose and leaves in France hundreds of
millions of money.
If the Dreyfus verdict destroy the charms of next
year's exposition, and nations intending to be pres
ent boycott and withdraw, the loss in money to the
French people will be enormous.
There is no doubt that Germany is keenly affronted
by the verdict at Rennes. In every possible way it
had been made known, on the word and honor of the
Kaiser himself, that his Government had had no deal
ings with Dreyfus, had received from him no informa
tion in violation of his duty as a soldier and a French
man nor any other kind of information. It was
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 12. 1899.
naturally expected that this German disavowal would
affect the court-martial, since the charge against
j Dreyfus gained its gravity because it assumed that he
had betrayed the military secrets of his country to
| Germany as an enemy of France.
To have accepted the German disavowal was to go
i a long step toward re-establishing cordiality between
\ the two countries. The Kaiser had announced his in
' tention to visit Paris during the exposition, and his
'â . presence there would have furthered the French pur
pose to provide every attraction that could add to the
,' pageantry of that occasion. Now, of course, he will
; not go. The Austrian Government takes sides with
â  him. Even Russia is profoundly stirred. The astute
J Muscovite feels keenly the error of an apparent mis
carriage of justice. Russia's French ally has made a
mistake, a disastrous and weakening blunder, and has
therefore diluted the importance of the alliance to
Russia. Italy, as a member of the Dreibund, will un
i doubtedly sympathize with Germany and Austria.
. The activity of the Jesuit party against Dreyfus has
rekindled the embers of aversion between the Italian
state and church, and has not affected favorably the
internal peace of Humbert's Government.
England is not pleased. The Fashoda incident and
i national rivalry in Africa have cast a shadow upon
| the relations of the two countries, and England, like j
Russia, abates any good opinion she may have cher
ished for her neighbor.
The discussion of the trial and the verdict reveals
â  everywhere the rising respect for the orderly processes
of the law. The apparent disregard of the rules of
evidence at Rennes, and the awful condemnation of a
man whose guilt was not proved according to any
civilized rule for getting at guilt by the taking and
â¢ weighing of evidence, have seemed to pass a gloom
, over the modern world such as comes with the pro
found shadow of a total eclipse of the sun.
In the present temper of the nations the first effect
: of the verdict threatens to be the failure of the great
; exposition. If this result is realized it will be put
among the causes that men will plead for a revolu
tion in France. The Government of President
' Loubet will now be profoundly tested. Just what are
his authorized resources for averting the force of the
; blow the outside world does not fully comprehend.
i The extent of his executive jurisdiction over the case
after the court-martial drops it with the sentence is
not clearly marked out in the constitution of the re
i public.
He may find a way to save his countrymen from
the consequences invoked by their passionate course,
and if he do it will place him among the world's lors
' most statesmen. To do justice to a probably innocent
nvin, save his country from revolution and reinstate
her in the world's respect is a task calling for the
highest statesmanship, and the nations will wish him
'â  well as he enters upon it.
An incorrigible young Oakland thief complains bit

THE GAMBLERS AT COLMA.
REPORTS from Colma are to the effect that the
gamblers have by no means abandoned their
scheme for incorporating a town in that dis
trict and making it headquarters for their gambling
i hells. The exposure of the scheme by The Call
! directed to it the attention of the people of the county
and at once there was an outburst of indignation and
earnest protest against the nefarious plan. Before
that expression of popular sentiment the gamblers re
: coiled, but they did .not retreat. It appears they are
but waiting for the storm to blow over and in the
meantime are quietly but persistently working to win
over to their side as many of the more credulous resi
dents of Colma and the vicinity as they can.
In a contest of this kind the people must be con
tinuously watchful. The gambling trade is nefarious,
but it is profitable. There are thousands of dollars to
â  be made by any set of men who can get a chance to
; maintain anywhere within the vicinity of San Fran
cisco poolrooms and other gambling devices open to
the public and free from police surveillance. When
the Ingleside track gamblers had their races and pool
rooms running in full blast they had something like a
bonanza, and thousands of dupes, women as well as
men, contributed to their enrichment.
Where so much money is to be made without risk
i and without the exercise of industry or of skill there
j are sure to be many unscrupulous men eager to take
advantage of it. They can afford to work a long time
on the scheme and they can afford to pay out large
sums for the concessions they wish. Even if one set
of gamblers abandon the scheme another set will
come forward to take it up. The contest against
gambling is, in fact, one that goes on from generation
to generation, and the attention of the gamblers be-
I ing now directed to Colma, the residents of that at
tractive suburb will have to be on guard continu
ously.
The tactics now adopted by the schemers is that of
dividing public sentiment at Colma and arraying one
set of residents against another. Should they succeed
in doing so it will be easy to make the contest appear
as a local controversy over incorporation, in which
the residents of other sections of San Mateo County
have no interest. T?y such means they hope to con
ceal their own activity in the matter and lead the pub
lic to believe that no question of gambling is involved.
Such tactics are cunning. They will be used to the
utmost to get the Supervisors to call an election on
the issue. When the election is called the gamblers
and all their political push will show themselves. The
genuine residents of the district will be overwhelm
ingly outvoted. The danger, it will be seen, is still
menacing. The people of San Mateo must be on
j guard and see to it that the Supervisors stand firmly
j against the efforts to corrupt the community.
There have been many people unkind enough to
say that San Francisco is jay, particularly with re
gard to fashion. They will have to take it all back
now. A cat belonging to a local milliner got into
the show window the other night and was so deceived
by the birds and plumage designed for female adorn
ment that she destroyed $100 worth in an effort to
obtain a toothsome meal. After that it would seem
that San Francisco is up to date on millinery, at any
rate.
Oakland is to have an exhibition this week of bird
less hats. The local milliner whose pet cat played
havoc with every stuffed bird in a valuable collection
of bonnets is certainly qualified to deliver a feeling
address on the subject.
In an answer to a suit filed against it for damages
the other day the Southern Pacific denies practically
everything except the interesting fact that it is still
on earth and a menace to its patrons.
A SHIP OF THE DESERT IN HARNESS.
In many of the Australasian colonies the camel is to a largo extent used for all kinrls of transportation. While in Africa
and Turkey and Asia poods are generally transported on camels' backs, In Australia, and especially in the colony of West
ern Australia, tho camel is mostly "harnessed," and has to do the same work as any other rlraft animal. The illustration
shows such a "ship of the desert" in harness used in the streets of Kilgoolie, the center and chief city of the flourishing gold
mining districts of Western Australia.

OF "BILLY"

near to having "lately deceased" and "re
mains" added to his other titles. And the
best of It is the death he so narrowly es
caped was that of a burglar and general
; all-around criminal, litre is the story of
| the gallant captain's adventure:
Barnes had been retained in the Mitchell
murder case at Colma, and his presence
was necessary at the preliminary examin
ation of the defendant.
He telegraphed to his father-in-law, D.
IC. Delmas, that he would pass the night
at the Delmas home in Mountain View
and then dismissed the matter of lodging
from liis mind. He passed the early part
of the evening in convivial pursuits in
this city, taking the owl train down to
the country. He arrived at Mountain
View in comparatively good condition and
walked out to the Delmas residence. But
upon arriving there he found the house
dark and deserted. No. one was at home.
Billy figured on the proposition for a little
i while. He remembered the many valuable
| hints he had received from professionals
1 during his career as District Attorney,
but, unfortunately, the men who had
1 given them to him were of smaller bodily
habit than the corpulent Native Son of
the Golden West. Suddenly, however, he
remembered some large double windows
th.it opened on the porch, and prying
these open he was soon inside. The niai
j ter of linding a bed and turning into it
Was only a minor detail and soon accom-
I pllshed.

who had been attending a small-and-early
I down the road, returned to the parental
roof filled with the â¢ xuberance of youth,
the glory of the night and a mixture of
various florid decoctions. He walked up
1 to the house and noticed the open window.
He at once thought that the place had
been entered by burglars who had ran
sacked it and left. As they had left he
decided to enter. So with a gun in one
hand and a candle in the other he pro
ceeded to Investigate. His shoes made
some noise on the stairs, and this noise
awakened the slumbering Billy. "Ha!"
said he, "burglars! I will escape while
yet there Is time." So softly he stole
from his bed and toward the door of his
room. Opening it suddenly, he came face
to face with his armed brother-in-law.
There was a dual gasp for breath and
then two rigid forms were stretched upon
the carpet. They had both fainted.

more than any one other influence to de- j

lucrativeness of prize fighting is purely a j
matter of newspaper advertising. The ;
Examiner has taken the initiative in the !

SODA OF CELERY HARMLESS.
Charles Hutchinson's Death Was Due
to a Disease of the Brain.
Chemist Crackbon reported to Coroner
Hill yesterday that there were no poison
ous substances In the "Soda of Celery"
which Charles E. Hutchinson had been
taking to cure a headache just before he
died. September 7, at the laborers' camn
on Nineteenth avenue, between X ana
L streets. The harmlessness of Soda of
Celery was also testified to by Dr Sliver
mon and Dr. Bradley Plymier The au
topsy showed that death had been caused
by hemorrhage of the brain, and the tes
timony developed the fact that the de
ceased had suffered from headache for a
long whileâ the result of the disease. The
jury rendered ;i verdict of death from
natural causes.
A representative of the Ferry Drug
Company, which pal up the Soda of Cel
ery, swallowed a triple dose left in the
bottle from which the medicine had been
taken by Hutchlnson. This was done in
order to show the Coroner and the jury
that the preparation is not harmful.
HEALTH OFFICERS CLASH.
Inspector Gans and Surgeon O'Rourke
Differ About Immature Veal.
There is a clash between Market In
spector Gans on one side and Veterinary
Surgeon O'Rourke and Officer Butter
worth on the other, and it may be neces
sary for the Health Board to take a hand
in the controversy to arrive at a satisfac
tory settlement,
It is all caused by the arrest of Jesse
Meyer by O'Rourke and Butterwnrth last
I Thursday. Meyer was apprehended on the
â  Mission road as he was bringing in a load
inf veal. O'Rourke pronounced the calves
i immature and two charges were placed
against Meyers, one of having immature
veal in his possession and the other of
slaughtering outside the limits.
Gans visited the t ity Prison where the
two calves were held as evidence and. on
examination, pronounced them whole-
Borne. In the face of this, however, J. C.
Witt, a rancher of San Mateo. says that
he sold the live calves to Meyer when
they were only three days old. They
were slaughtered by Meyer on the day he
bought them.
Gans claims that O'Rourke is invading
his official domain, while the latter de
clares that if Gans s^ys that the two
calves in question are over three days old
hi is not competent to perform his duties
and should produce some valid reasons for
his conclusion.
The case will not come up until the lat
ter part of the week, when Judge Conlan
will decide between the opposing Health
em pi (â ' \ es.

nineteenth century.
MAJOR GENERAL AND BRIGADIER

who is Commander-in-chief. The adjutant
genera] on the staff of the commander-in
chief ranks as a brigadier general, but
be has no authority of his own volition to
issue any order to the major general. If
he gives any orders to the major general
be does so as emanating from the cora
mander-in-chief, delivering them just the
same as an aid, orderly or messenger
! would. But the brigadier general would
be bound to obey any order Issued by the
major general, despite the fact that he
! is adjutant, general.

or may hereafter be coined at the
mints Of the United States, or any foreign
gold or silver coins which are by law
made current or are in actual use or cir
culation as money within the I'nitetl
Suu. .-. shall be Imprisoned for not more
than two years ami fined not more than
$2800." A man may have a number of
coii s of the I'nited States or coins such as
described in the section of the- law quoted,
and if he feels inclined to have the same
melted tor the purpose of converting such
into either bullion o-r jewelry he is per
fectly Tree to (to so. The money, if he
came by it legitimately, is his own and
he is at liberty to do whatever he pleases
with it: but he is not permitted to deface
t!ie coin or to lighten its weight and then
try to pass it as genuine without In
curring the penalty. A man. if he was
foolish enough To do so. could cut or cho:>

Refuses to Reduce July and August
Accounts to Bring Them Within
the Appropriation as Per
rault Suggested.
There Is every reason to believe that the
city may af ft in darkness If the
â¢ the San Francisco Gas and Elec-
I 'ompany for lighting the streets and
buildings . :â â¢â  not paid. President
â v. in a communication sent to the
re yesterday, reiterates
ii threat he made in August last that un
the bills of iiis company art paid the
- of the municipality will be shut m(T.
The company is disposed to resort to re
taliatory measures in order to force the
â  paj the bills.
The communication is in reply to one
sent by Chairman Perrault of the Finance
Committee accompanying the bills for
August, which were returned to the com
pany because they were $533 over and In
excess of the appropriation pursuant to
the tax levy adopted by the Supervisors,
and calculated according to the one
twelfth act. Chairman Perrault requested
Mr. Crockett to scale down the bills so
they would come within the appropria
tion. Incidentally Perrault stated that
according to Gas Inspector Tupper the
streets had not been lit on one nignt when
they should have been, and he asked that
the charge be stricken out.
In reply Mr. Crockett refused to com
ply with both requests and took occasion
to refer the board to his letter of August
12. This accompanied the bills for July.
which had also been returned by the Fi
nance Committee because they were $1400
in excess of the legal appropriation. This
Is the letter in which threats were made
to row the whole city and the public
buildings in /darkness unless the bills were
paid as originally presented by the gas
company.
The matter is now in abeyance, and it
Is a clear-cut issue between the Supervi
sors and the gas company. Perrault and
his colleagues on the committee have no
intention of king down from their po
sition, anil say that unless the bills are
reduced so as to come within the appro
priation they will not be paid. Whether
the corporation intends to make good its
threats or whether it is only running a
iarge-sized bluff to coerce the Supervisors
into submitting to its dictates remains to
be seen.

the Derelict.

THEY WANT AN ADVANCE OF

Dead â The Steamer Cleve
land Short of Coal.
The collier Czarina arrived last night
from Puget Sound without her tow. She
i lost the big iVXVfoot raft off the coast of
â  sfendodno nearly a week ago, and ever
i since has been searching for it. The tug
I Fearless was sent out to assist her, but
I since she passed out through the (Jnlden
. Oate nothing has been heard of her. The
general Impression is that the Fearless
' has picked up the raft and Is towing It
into port.
A number of vessels have reported the
derelict, and the ship Oriental and the
steamer Umatllla nearly ran into it. Yes
terday the steamer Crescent City came
I in and reported having lighted the raft
and the captain said he thought it was
towing;. This was twenty-five mtles nortli
west of Point Reyes and the fog was so
thick that nothing could be seen dis
tinctly.
In his report Captain Seamen of the
Czarina pays: "Left Seattle on August
28 with log raft in tow. All went well
until September 7 at 6 a. m., when the
hawser parted in a heavy sea. We were
then twenty-eight miles west by north
one-half north of Point Arena. Lost the
raft in a heavy fog. I put into Point I
CAUGHT IN A HEAVY NORTHEASTER.
THE brig W. G. Irwin had the roughest voyage of any of this month's sugar fleet from Honolulu. For three days she
was buffeted by a northeast p-ali and Beveral of her sails were blown away. The doors of th< forecastle were stove in
and the sailors were nearly drowned out A heavy sea carried away the brig's figure-head, while another took every
thing movable on deck overboard. The Jrwln may be delayed a few days in discharging owing to the strike among
the 'longshoremen.
Arena twice in search of information nnu |
have kept circling around the place where
the raft went adrift in widening circles,
hoping to pick it up. On the 9th Inst we
spoke the 'tug Fearless, and as she was
going to continue the search I put into
San Francisco."
It is to be honed the Fearless picks up
the derelict and brings it into port, as It
is now a menace to navigation. __ t __
Strikes seem to be epidemic on the water
front JuPt now. Boiler-makers, carpenters
and painters have gone out at different
times during the month for either shorter
hours or more pay. and yesterday the
longshoremen followed suit. They are
paid by the hour, so naturally it is an
advance in wages they want. The strik
ers are the "outside" longshoremenâ that ,
is- those not connected with the union
arid they demand 50 cents an hour. Some
months ago they were satisfied with 33
cents an hour, then they demanded and
got 40 cents, and now they want 50 cents. <
The vessels principally affected by the
demand are the cannery fleet and tJu !
sugar boats. The Roderick Dhu and the
Edward -May had to get the sugar out
and the agents agreed to pay the extra
money. At noon yesterday the longshore- ,
men went to work discharging them. The
other vessels are holding out, and as there
are plenty of men they will probably have
no trouble in getting their cargoes out.
There wan a serious stabbing an air
among the Italian fishermen In the/Co
lumbia Market yesterday. Pietro Quillici
was standing at stall 79 doing some busi
ness and near by was Guiseppe Garattl,
an old man and quarrelsome. The
younger fishermen had been teasing him
during the morning, and about noontime
some one In the crowd called him a foul
ram" Garattl thought It was Quillicl
who used the epithet and, drawing a
knife he stabbed him in the back. Officer
T J 'Bailey was called in and he took the
two' men to the Ilarpor police station.
There Garatti was charged with an as
sault with a deadly weapon. At the Har
bor Hospital Drs. Robinson and Murphy
found that Quillici had a deep and serious
wound over the left kidney. Old man
Garatti had documents in his pockets
Showing that he had several thousand
dollars in bank.
William A. Imperil, chief engineer of |
the steamer Aurora, died suddenly aboard
the Pride of the River from a hemorrhage j
yesterday morning. He was talking with
his son when taken sick. The*latter se
cured an ambulance and had his father
conveyed to the Harbor Hospital, but
when Drs. Robinson and Murphy ex
amined him he was dead. The Morgue j
was notified, but after an examination the
Coroner allowed the body to be taken
to 1228 Golden Gate avenue, the family
residence of the deceased.
The steamer America Maru sailed for
San Francisco from Yokohama on the!
10th inst She was delayed by a small ,
lire in her coal bunkers.
The steamer Cleveland was late in
netting to Seattle owing to running short
of coal Her charterers sent her out for St.
Michael with a short supply and no |
coal could be got at Dutch Harbor when
the vessel called there. In consequence
all the bunks in the steerage had to be i
torn out â '" used for fuel, while the <

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 12, 1899.
CHRIS RYER DIED ON
THE SURGEON'S TABLE
CHRISTOPHER B. RYER. one of
the best known liquor drummers
on the coast, died suddenly yes
terday forenoon on the operating
table of the Golden Gate Sanitarium.
Mr. Ryer returned to this city a week
ago last Wednesday and on Sunday
morning went to the sanitarium to be
treated for a disease of the bladder.
He was advised by his physicians, Drs.
A. <;. Doardorff and J. P. I,e Fevre,
that a simple surgical operation would
relieve him. and he consented to sur
render to the knife. He did not think
it necessary to notify his family that
an operation was about to be per
formed, and the news of his death
came to them as a sudden and over
whelming shock.
Yesterday morning he was placed
upon the operating table and r>r. Le
Fevre proceeded to administer an
anaesthetic, when Mr. Ryer went into
a convulsion and expired. The physi
cians reported to Coroner Hill that
they did not believe that Mr. Ryer
inhaled much if any of the anaesthetic,
and that his death was largely due to
sudden nervous depression caused by
fright.
Mr. Ryer came prominently before the public several years ago as a contest
ant of the will of Dr. Washington Ryer. a pioneer of this city, claiming to be
a natural son of the doctor. The case was finally compromised out of court
by the payment to young Ryer of a snug sum, a part of which he invested in
residence property in Richmond.
The deceased had been employed by the wholesale liquor firm of Joseph
Premer & Co.. at 310 Sacramento street. He was a large, fine looking man and
weighed more than 250 pounds. He left a widow, two daughters and a son. the
elder daughter being Mrs. A. Cohen of Oakland and the younger Miss- Mabel
Ryer of this city. C. Blalne Ryer, the son. is employed by Bremer & Co.
vile stuff and dumped it Into the hay.
Had it not been for the vigilance of In
spectors <;nns and Barwn the rotten fish
would have been tnken up town and sold
to the cheap restaurants.
A telegram received from London by
the Merchants' Exchange states that the
chances of getting the Morgan City off
the beach at the entrance to Nagasaki
are good. Divers have been engaged to
patch up the hole in the vessel's hull.
Mike Keddy, an old timer on the front,
died in the City and County Hospital yes
terday. Mike knew every ship captain
that came into port during the last
twenty-seven years and was a walking
encyclopedia wh^n !t came to ships.
SENSATION PROMISED
IN RULOFSON CASE
OPPOSING COUNSEL INDULGE IN
WORDY WARFARE.
Eisner Charges Checkering With Un
prcf^ssicnal Conduct â Witnâ¬ss?s
Testify in Claimant's Favor.
A sensation in the trial of the action in

adopted son of the late Captain Winslow
G. Hall, in which the deceased seeks to
recover decedent's estate by virtue of
his relationship, Is in course of develop
ment, yesterday morning Attorney
Eisner, who is prosecuting Mr. Rulofson's
claim, accused opposing counsel. Attorney
Ohickering, before the court convened,
of having been guilty of unprofessional
conduct, in that he had caused certain
witnesses for th> claimant to be ap
proach.'d and after deceiving them with
the assertion that he. ('nickering, wap
confidential counsel for Rulofson obtained
what Information they possessed.
Mr. Ohickering denied the assertion
with warmth, and an argument that
threatened to culminate in blows was
being indulged in by counsel. When
Judge Belcher entered the courtroom the
trouble ceased. Eisner got In the last
words in the argument and said that he
would produce three witnesses to prove
his assertion. Judge Belcher then took
the bench and the taking of testimony
was resumed. M. Hart and Julius Hart.

JUSTICES' FEES.
The Supreme Court Determines Their
Legal Limit.
The Supreme Court decided yesterday
j that a Justice of the Peace may not
j charge more than $2 as his fee in a civil
I action for issuing; a writ. The charge I
I hitherto has been $3 50 and the change!
may result in a diminution of the force in
the Justices' Clerk's office.
The decision was reached in the appeal
: of the case Kosminsky vs. Williams, con
-1 firming a decision by Judge Seawell. The
i original case was brought on mandamiiH
proceedings instituted by Kosminsky
through his attorneys, Samuel Kosfiiheim i

Clerk Williams to accept $2 as a fee for
issuing a writ. The Supreme Court de- !

DEPOSITORS PAY
NO COMMISSION
TO UNCLE SAM
No Tax on a Receipt
Given a Bank.
MUST PRESENT PERSONALLY
IF OFFERED BY THIRD PARTY
IT MUST BE STAMPED.
'â  .'nternal Revenue Collector Holds :
That Non-Negotiable Paper Is
Exempt Irom Operation of
War Revenue Law.
â¢
It will be of interest to the general pub
lic to know that there are some things
1 which the war-revenue tax does not tax.
This information will especially interest
those who have small sums on deposit in
the savings banks, but are not in the for
tunate position of being able to employ
the advice of able counsel to protect their
Interests. It appears that a man with a
bank account may draw upon the same
without being compelled to make a forced
contribution to Uncle Sam's income, pro
vided he makes a personal visit to the
bank to get his money. In other words,
the depositor is not obliged to pay a com
mission to the Government for the privi
lege of using his own money, as has been I
generally supposed was the case.
This welcome fact has been brought to
light through the attention of Internal
Revenue Collector Lynch being called to
the action of a bank In Suisun, which has
been for some time past issuing un
stamped receipts to depositors, to be j
signed by them when they desired to draw
money from the bank, a practice alleged
to be in violation of the war tax law
which provided that all checks, drafts,
etc, must bear a two-cent revenue stamp.
Collector Lynch says the bank in ques
tion Is acting strictly within the law and
he further says that the savings banks of
this city are using the same methods and
exact a revenue stamp only when the re
ceipt is presented by a third person. This
opinion Is in accordance with a decision
rendered by the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue after consultation with the At
torney General. The decision was the re
sult of a communication from the cashier
of the Bank of Lancaster, S. C, and is as
follows: ,'-.
Treasury â¢ Department,
Office of .Commissioner "i Internal Revenue.
WASHINGTON. D. C Oct. 21. IS9S.
Sir: I have to acknowledge the receipt of
your letter of the 2tith hurt., In which you
request the ruling of this office as to whether
a receipt In me following form:
i LANCASTER, S. C,
Received of the Hank of Lancaster, of Lan
caster, P. C. dollars on account. .
filled out in the handwriting of an official
of the bank an.l signed by a depositor on .
calling for and receiving money. is liable to
stamp duty.
In reply you are advised that, in accordance I
with the advice of the Attorney General, this ;
office holds that a receipt given to a bank
by a person to whom th.- bank is Indebted
as a depositor or otherwise, or for whom it
holds funds, is do more subject to a stamp
than a receipt received or given for any
other debt or demand.
The purpose of the law Is to require stamps |

Instruments. A check, however, Is not required
to be in any particular form. If it i.Â« In a
form sufficient to constitute an order for the .
payment of money and assumes the character '

It is subject to the tux. â¢'.
There is much banking done, especially in
savings banks, without the use of checks at
nil. the depositor having a book In which the
bank denotes the amount deposited on one [
side and the amount drawn out on the other.
Of course, the depositor In such case draws
the money out of the bank, but he does it in
such a WRy as not to subject It to stamp duty,
because he does not give a check. So. if a
person does not give a check he does not I
have to pay taxes on it and If he goes to the
bank and the bank pays him upon He dues
to him and he gives a receipt such receipt
does not require a stamp; but If he Issues a
receipt BO that it will be good In the hands
of another person to draw upon his deposit
for the amount of It then It loses the character
of a receipt and becomes a check or draft and
is subject to tax. Respectfully yours.
G. W. WILSON. Acting Commissioner.
The commercial banks have â  not yet
adopted the receipt plan, according to Col- {
lector Lynch, but pay out money only on
checks or drafts which must be stamped
or they will not be accepted. Collector
Lynch* further says he started to round
up the banks in this district that were
using these receipts several months ago.
hut when the decision in the case quoted
was promulgated he was obliged to stop

TAX OFFICE RECORDS.
Old Volumes Are in Bad Condition
and Must Be Repaired to Avoid
Complications.
Tax Collector Shcehan will shortly pe
tition the Supervisors to provide for the
preservation of some of the old tax rec- i
ords in his office which have been stored
in the basement of the City Hall for
many years. Some of the volumes are
torn and without bindings and unless they
are cared for they will be completely
ruined Mr. Shcehan says that unless
enough money is appropriated to rebind
the records he will be compelled to deny
searchers of records the privilege of re
ferring to them. He realizes that this ;
may result in a suit against the city, as,
the' records are public property and all
citizens are entitled to see them. I
Many pages in the volumes have al
ready "been torn out or stolen and the Tax
Collector, to prevent further damage, has
locked some of the records in the vault. '
Certain maps in the books are exceedingly ;
valuable and it would be impossible to
replace them should they be destroyed.

The New York Commercial Bays:
â¢'For the past ten days there has been an
Improving tendency, and prices on some vari
eties are firmer and higher than they have
been. Prunes show this Improvement more
than other sorts, but none of the others have
been co badly down. Trading: Is beginning,
but very few large pales have been made, and
those at unnamed prices. There is reason to
Ink, however, that about full figures have
been obtained, though in the absence of defi
nite information no positive statement can be
made. Negutiatlons for a large number of
enle-s are pending, but bo far buyers and sell
ers' have been una to agree upon terms.
"Apricots are firm and prices tend upward,
though no quotable change In price has oc
curred recently. Holders are firm and refuse
to make concessions, even on round lots. The
r.eÂ« quality commands 16c f. o. b., but other
frrades range down to lie. The market has
been slow since the season opened, and buyers
have nut taken hold with any enthusiasm; but
n:ore activity is expected, and some dealers
think trade will be much better within the
r.rxt week.
"Peaches continue easy, more because of un
certainty than because of a surplus. To be
cure, the surplus Is indicated, but the condi
tions warrant no definite predictions at this
time. The season opened with prices firm, but
there has been a weakening ever elnce, and
now prices are a, matter of negotiation."

EASTERN MARKETS.
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Sept. 11.â Forced liquidation
was In evidence all day on the Stock Exchange
lie the conseouence of the efforts of the banks
to reduce their deposit liabilities by a reduc
tion of loans. Saturday's bunk statement re
veaJed the fact that the surplus reserves were
approaching exhaustion, with the Imminent
prospect of Inroads being made upon the legal
retor\e having prepared the speculative pub
lic for come such development. The continued
demand from interior sources for money and
payments for taxes in the sub-treasury to-day
confirmed the expectation. The market went
down under successive floods of offers. At
various times during the day the pressure of
s-'lling teemed to have exhausted Itself. The
rally in prices at such times was feeble, and
the trading became very -dull, the demand be
Ing at a minimum The standard stock suf
fered in an equal degree with the more specu
lative industrial*. This feature was doubtless
due In tome part to the recent disinclination
on the part of money lenders to accept the In
dustrials as collaterals for loans. It was, there
fore, the standard stocks which were thrown
upon the market by the calling of loans. Aside
from a few of the Iron and steel stocks, which
have been under manipulation for a rise, the
lamebt losses of the day are in such stocks as
the grangers and trunk lines. There were a few
BpetÂ» In the railroads that were relatively firm,
notably Louisville, Southern Pacific, Union Pa
ciilc and Northern Pacific. The bears seized
the opportunity of the prevailing depression to
put out extensive short lines. Brooklyn Rapid
Transit was a notable sufferer, and was raided
down to within a quarter of the recent low
level and within a half of par. The stock
closed only a fraction above the lowest. Met
ropolitan Street Railway was also acutely af
fected and lost 4'Â» on the day. Tennessee Coal
and Colorado Fuel rose In the early dealings,
but fell 2 points below Saturday's level before
the close. Sugar was only slightly affected.
American Steel and Wire, Republic Steel, both
common and preferred. Tin Plate preferred.
Continental Tobacco, Pullman. National Steel.
Manhattan and People's GaÂ» were especially
weak. The net losses on most of the active
railroad stocks ran*?e bKween 1 and 2 points.
The quotations for ordered lots ranged above
a full lot quotation In most cases, indicating:
the presence of bargain hunters during the de
cline. The market totally ignored the tend
ency to recover on foreign stock markets, al
though London bought some 20,000 shares In the
early dealings. Call loans were made at 6V4
per cent Boon after the opening, but quickly
ro?e to C and then 7 and even S per cent, drop
ping to 'â¢> Per cent after the day's needs had
been practically all met. Possible measures I
of relief for the money market were the sub- i
ject of discussion in all circles. The leaving
on deposit of payments for taxes U considered
the most available relief, and the presence In
â Washington of an influential financial leader
â¢was generally believed to be with the object
of urging such a measure.
The present high price of Government bonds,
Which must be deposited with the banks as se
curity for Government funds left on deposit
â with them. Is a possible drawback to this plan,
though It Is asserted that the banks will be
able to borrow Government bonds to use for
this purpose. The sterling exchange raY failed
to yield In spite of the tightness of money and
buying for London account, but exchange on
Paris did fall a fraction.
Bonds weakened In sympathy with stocks,
but the selling pressure was not severe. Total
sales, par value, $2, 299,000.
United States bonds were unchanged in bid
quotations.

Chicago Grain Market.
a, â¦
CHICAGO, Sept. 11.â Wheat opened weak at
j a decline of about Vie from Saturday. Every
| thing In the way of news favored sellers, and
a distinct inclination to liquidation was shown
'by longs for a short time after. Liverpool
i quotations showed a decline of %c, and world's
shipments were 6,810.000 bushels, or about 200.
--000 bushels over estimated weekly require
ments. Receipts at all points were large, and
I the seasonable weather prevailing everywhere
; augured a continuance of a bis country move
' ment. December wheat opened at 70% c, com
'â  pared with yesterday's closing price of 71'*c.
j It sold at 70%@70%C, and then slowly rallied
j to 71c under a moderate covering movement,
I but this demand satisfied, the market dropped
' again. The price got under puts and stayed
there most of the time until late In the ses
sion. The Government report was expected
1 this afternoon, and pending its publication
] traders did not care to do much either way.
I contenting themselves with evening up as
j much as possible. As a result, prices for long
| peril were practically at a standstill. Eu
ropean crop reports were more favorable than
i of late, and this Induced more or less scat-
I tered liquidation, especially early in the scs
i sion. New York reported an advance In freight
rates was interfering with export business.
I About thirty loads were taken ..or export.
! Late In the day the market was stiffened by
i tips that the Government report would show
! a big drop. This caused enough buying to
! advance the December price to 71% c, where it
, closed. September closed unchanged at 70% c
I after selling at 70c.
I Corn was dull and Irregular. Weak cables
I and heavy receipts gave the market a down
ward tendency, but a demand from shorts for
deferred futures held prices steady. There was
I Home commission-house liquidation of Septem
! ber and prices of that option declined slightly.
December closed unchanged. September closed
I %6'ic lower.
Oats were quiet but firm, though opening
I lower In sympathy with other grains. Shorts
j were good buyers and the shipping demand
I was good. December closed with a gain of
%@*4c, and September rose He.
Provisions early in the session suffered a
little from the spread of yellow fever In the
South, which caused some outside selling.
Packers were good buyers and the slight de
, cline was recovered. The cash demand was
I good, and there was some talk of a shortage
iin young hogs. At the close October pork
was 5c higher; lard and ribs, unchanged.

A CHORUS THAT IS NOT QUITE
UP TO DATE.
Columbia Will Have a Week of
Darkness Preparatory to the

Modjsska.
The characteristic inability of melo
drama to leave anything unsaidâany
thing to the imagination is very restful
to the brain, 'specially after a season of
dramatic eplgrauÂ», "The Wages of Sin"
Js unquestionably a melodrama. You
can calculate to a hair who is to make
the next entrance and whyâ you feel the
shadows before the: cast them. No, not
always the shadowsâ sometimes the
gleams of sunshine. Nothing in the action
<jf lite, Is cut that can be slowly and pain
tully unur-d, the unaccustomed side of a
lact i.Â« never presented, the most im
possible things happen, the most unlikely
people hob-nob and yet if you lot your
eelf go with tne action hither and" yon,
stionlngly you will find the evening
far from dull. I have never seen any
one overcome the soliloquy of melodrama,
the intolerable lengths of dul explana
tory conversation, better than Eugene
Ormonde. To make love in the open ten
feet from a door marked "office " and not
v. stone's throw from a busy mill, is
neither a natural nor an easy task. He
made it seem both. He was never for
a moment melodramatic But after all,
Why should he be? There is nothing es
pecially melodramatic In a pure ambition
or in a life devoted to it. He looked well
in clerical garb, too, though not like a
clergyman. Still 1 snatched this verse
from the iipa of an impromptu poet be
hind me:
O, Ormcnde, Eugene Ormonde â
You were born to wear thÂ« cloth.
'Tis life, old man, you're giving vs â
Not actingâ by my troth!
He gives a painstaking, lingering treat
ment to the pathetic parts, but he does not
overdo em, and he never strives for a
pose that shall be scrupulously becoming.
Mips Foster wao a quiet, effective Ruth
Hope and Miss Helen Henry a dainty
ltose Deane. She selects her business
charmingly. Mi*s Juliet- Crosby as Juliana
liloggs, tho coming Juliet, did her best
work in the stage-struck vein. Miss Howe
had an excellent make-up as the mother
whose dull visions of a lost Utopia (the
coal and "tater" husiness) rose ever be
tween her and the fame of dear Juliana.
She carrier 1 her sorrows most commo
dlously and effectively. Those ho had
much to say said it knowingly, from a
melodramatic standpoint, and the smaller
ones did their no less important duty.
What Is the exact office of melodrama Is
a question for the wisest. Perhaps its
object is what Mrs. Bloggs said was the
object of Juliana's benefit: "To get - as
many people into the 'ouse as the 'ouse
will 'old." If so. it generally succeeds.

FOOD ECONOMY.

Concentration.
Grape â  Nuts.
Diec -issed Bc'ow.
Th" question <~>i obtaining a high
food at a moderate i>ri<< e is of in-
â  .-.â¢ housekeeper and pro-
vider.
Some food la so bulky that even at a
very low price per pound the actual
food value ie BO little that it is really
expensive; on the ether hand, there are
concentrated foods, like, for instance,
the famous breakfast food known as
â¢'Grape-Nuts," that yield in food units
co much value that but little of the food
bhould be used at a time, and in reality,
when properly used, the expense la
above one cent per meal.
, It Is a common mistake to use too
'much of the food Grape-Nufs. Its taste
is crisp, with the delicate sweet flavor
of grape sugar, and one Is inclined to
eat double the proper quantity. A lady
writes from Indianapolis. Mrs. A. L.
Wilson: "We have been using your
Grape-Nuts now for two or three
weeks. l cannot tell you how much I
lind it has benefited me. My husband
is a physician and he not only uses it at
each meal, but like* it at bedtime."
i ing the food In this way, some
families might be impressed with the
co&t, but after all, good food, which
keeps the family in prime condition of
health, at a moderate cost, is very much
more profitable, so far as dollar* and
centÃ ,re concerned, than to make use
cf low-grade, bulky foods and from
time to time call in a physician to help
out;
The use of "Grape-Nuts' in reason-
nble quantity costs one cent per meai,
and the food stands without an equal
in point of nutrition and value in build-
ing up the nerve centers and tissues of
the tody. The crisp, delicate, sweet
taste come* from the grape sugar which
is produced by transformation of the
starch Of the cereals, and this grape
HUgar is presented to the system, ready
for immediate assimilation. Grape-
Nuts a-o sold by all first-class grocers
and made by the PoFtum Co. at their
lactoric* in Battle Creek, Michigan. j
\A agnerlan characters. Mr. Berthald
lias been steadily rising In the estima
tion of the public, and his Lohengrin j
has brought him an ovation which will
nx his reputation as a first-class artist
forever in this city.
Mary Linck proved, as was to be ex
pected, a most acceptable Ortrude. The
role seems to be exactly within the range
or her resonant contralto, and her |
dramatic temperament has ample oppor- j
'-unity to reveal itself. Her work in
t Lohengrin" together with her Amneris :
In "Aida" was certainly the best she has i
done during the present season, and In :
the success of these two roles she has ;
! demonstrated that she is fit to appear in !
I grand opera.
Miss Prossnitz's Elsa was one of the !
gratifying features of the evening be- j
cause of her sympathetic and serious
conception. William Mertens' Telramund
breathed the atmosphere .of the trained
musician. The orchestra did some excel
lent work, and it will net be an exag
geration to admit that Mr. Berthald and
I the orchestra are sufficient compensation
â for those who desire to hear really good
: music. Mr. Hirschfeld is entitled to a
! large amount of credit 'for the artistic
; achievement of his orchestra.
i The only drawback of the evening was
the male chorus. At times it was simply
abominable. There is one Individual
who should be surpressed, for he is abso-
I lutely unable to sing in tune. Harmony
and tempo seem to be unknown quan
tities to some of the "lobsters" in that
chorus. Perhaps after this first night a
change will be noticeable. It ougnt to ]
be improved at all events.
Altogether it was an excellent per
formance, especially as far as the solo
ists and orchestra" are concerned. This
evening Othello will be given.
ALFRED METZGER.
Orpheum.
The brave volunteers from Minnesota
and South Dakota were well represented
at the Orpheum last night and the man
! agement gave them a big bill. "When the
: stars and stripes were unrolled from in
i front of the proscenium the audience
arose and cheered the Hag again and
again as the orchestra played the "Star-
Spangled Banner." The boys who wore
the blue so gallantly were equally en
thusiastic wh'/j the biograph snowed the
I vv. York SJf.ty-nlnth at Tampa, Fla.,
: and a battle scene from Cuba.
' The Orpheum has an exceptionally line
bill this week. The new people were
warmly received and repaid the warmth
! of their reception with the excellence of
their performance. The Crawford sisters,
character change comediennes, are pretty,
j dress prettily and do the Cakewalk well.
i White and Harris are a speedy team
â  White being an Irresistibly funny Irish-
I man afflicted with Swede-ophobia. while
i Miss Harris is decidedly up to date.
! Grand Opera-House.
1 Yon Suppe's charming comic opera,
"Fatinltza," was the attraction at the
Grand Opera-house last night and all the
; principals were in the cast. Hattie Belle
Ladd was the young lieutenant who mas
queraded as Fatinitza, and she seemed
i to lack her usual vivacity and several
; times forgot her lines. She was so ill In
the early part of the evening that it was
feared she would not be able to carry
out the part, but she struggled bravely
through it to the end. William Wolff as
â  the Russian general was in his element
! and stormed and raved to the satisfaction
of everybody. Edith Mason was Princess
I,ydia and sang with her usual charm.
â  She Introduced the song "Because I Love
i You" and had to repeat it. Thomas H.
Persse was the war correspondent and
I WB.s encored for his song, "My Native
] Land." The shadow pantomime in the
i harem scene was well executed. The cos
| turner were elegant and the choruses
j finely rendered.

NEWS OF THE REALTY WORLD
NO real estate transactions of rote

week, but there 1? a marked and

ment property, especially In the
wholesale district, and a number of good
Â«ized deals are being negotiated, with
tvery prospect of early consummation.
Septembers poor showing thus far is in
a large measure due to the fact that there
have been too many holidays, the effects
of wnich were felt In all lines of business.
\Vi at with Labor day, the Jewish re

The work of laying the rails for the

present terminus at Jackson street will

There has been a noticeable falling off
in the number of building contracts, but
ten having been recorded during the
week representing an aggregate outlay of
$47 432 The largest contract recorded dur
ing the week was that of John F. Boyd
with J W- Miller and Ingerson & Gore,
to make a four-story out of a three-story
buiid'ng on the northeast line of Steuart
street 1X3:4 feet northwest of Mission
street' for $'.Mi 7. The next largest con
tract was that of A. A. Russell and J. J.
Stahl with Jullu Sullivan, to erect two
two-story buildings on the north line of
Seventeenth street, 110:3 feet east of Guer
rero street, for $y4.",0. Mrs. Rosalie
Qreenebauxn contracted with J. Round
tit-.. F C. Jones and J. G. Peterson for
work on a house on the east line of
Franklin street, 75:3 V, feet south of Wash
ington to OOStÂ«fT4oa Felix Marcuse con
tracted with Marcuse <te Remmel for a
two-ntory frame building on the west line
of Stanyan street, 50 feet south of Par
nassus street, to cost $GOOG. jha other
cor tracts of the week ranged in value
from $1450 to $4240.
Undoubtedly the principal reason for
the falling off In the number of build
ing contracts is the present unusually
high price of building material. On this
sui.ject the following Hum Thomas Ma-
K e^ & Bon's Real Estate Circular will be
of Interest:
"The prices of building material have
rapidly advanced of late. Lumber han ad
i about 'Â£< per cent within the past
two years. In IMS rough lumber was
110 SO per thousand while on August 1,
18M it was from $15 to $16 per thousand,
and" now Its price is about $18 per thou
sand surface lumber is from $30 to $35 pe.r
thousand; pine stepping is $38 per thou
sand A landlord told us the other day
t'-a't "had he built a building for manufac
turing purposes a year ago he could have
saved about $6nou, but that he had been
repaid for wailing because he had been
able to make a favorable lease lately,
whereas a year ago he would not have
been able to lease at all.
"The price of iron and plumbing mate
rials has also advanced 40 to 70 per cent
in the past two years. Bricks have ad
vanced from about $6 per thousand to
$v 50 per thousand. Lime and cement have
advanced about 20 per cent within a year.
The urlce of glass has greatly advanced.
There Is no material advance in mechan

getting *3 P er da^ and bricklayers $5 per
"""Hut if the boom In building material has
bad a temporarily depressing efTect, Au
gust certainly held its own with a record
of 111 contracts filed, representing an ag
gregate outlay of 5A36.650. which has been
exceeded but once during the present
year when the contracts filed represented
nn outlay of $671,953, and which ia the

WORKS WONDERS

Big Gain in Dues and
Initiation.
â â¦
RESCISSION OF THE BONDS
POLICY OF THE NEW ADMINIS
TRATION IS PROGRESSIVE.
Amendment Carried Which Empow
ers the Board of Directors to
Fix Dues and Initiation
Fees at Will.
"Gretr Harrison is the only man who
could have done it," was what old mem- \
i bers of the Olympic Club said last night \
1 when the meeting which was called to
: amend the section of the by-laws relating
to Initiation fees and dues was finally ad
journed. Greer Harrison accomplished
more In the short space of a single hour
last night than any other man In evidence
1 could have done with tho Olympic Club i
I members in two years of constant of- !
fort.
The members by a unanimous vote j
'passed a resolution which empowers the j
board of directors to nominate the amount :
1 for initiation and dues. At present the
; Initiation fee of the Olympic Club is $10
and flues $3. By the action of the mem
bers in special meeting the directors have
I been given full sway to increase both
Initiation and dues, but there was a ;
j pledge made last night that the amounts
I would not exceed |25 for the rirst and $o ,
: monthly fur t he second.
Installation of officers was the first I
i number on the programme. Retiring
President John C. Kfrkpatrick occupied
ill" chair of honor and in neatly trimmed
1 speeches Installed the entire new board
, of managers. By clever arrangement the
I new president, Greer Harrison, was not
; introduced until the last. The warmth
I and arder *f all other demonstrations
was aa nothing to the reception which
Harrison's name provoked. Mr. Harri
; son had something to tell the members,
i and he reeled oft his tale with most tell
j ing effect.
Ex-President Kirkpatrlck had painted a
! picture of the club's financial condition,
in which he worked well up into the fore- I
ground the SiXUiAi debt which Is due the ;
i-"ir-H National Hank and spoke uf the in- !
> come, which was $47;""'. and the expenses,
which reached within a few hundred dol- !
; lars of that amount. When he mentioned :
! the recisiou of bonds, an effort inaugu
: rated by the last board, the club members
awoke and KJrkpatrick was roundly ap
plauded.
The officers were installed us follows:
! Vice president, H. K. Mann; secretary, I.
J. Hassell; treasurer, H. H. Russ; direc
tors Hammersmith, James. Rama leu, i-.i-
Hott Shea and Burns. Then came Q
Harrison and he .iudged his time well.
"We have a debt of over $32,000 without
a reasonable hope of paying It oft," he .
said "unless some great change is made
in the financial workings of the club.
1 That is why we have called the special
meeting to-night which, if the members
are In with the directors, will end
: in an amendment that will be a panacea
I for nil our ills."
after that President Harrison took his
1 audience back to ancient Home in descrip
i t'ions of the new hathing arrangements
i which the directors wanted to give the
members. This would cost $Imhx). New
handball courts where the men would not
< gel steam baths from their own perspira
tion and which are to cost. s2ooo were
promised.
"The club must be built back to Its old
I athletic, efficiency," continued Mr. Harri
'â¢ son "and to do it we will have all kinds
iof athletic entertainment. We will bring
1 the best amateur atbletes from all over
', the world and make this club a Mecca
of true amateur sport."
About this time the new president had .
' his men well in hand. A telegram from
Herman Qelricha, which promised a can- j
cellatlon of $40,000 bonds held by the :
i Fair estate, was the tlrst big bomb ex- j
year since 1595. During the first eight
months of the present year the value of
the contracts exceeded by nearly 1800,000
the value of those filed during the'corre
; sponding period of last year.
That a prosperous season is ahead for
i San Francisco is the tlrm belief of the
real estate dealers of the city almost
; without exception, and their faith Is by
no means shaken by the dullness of the
: summer months. This feeling of confi
dence cannot perhaps be better expressed
I than by again quoting from Thomas Ma
gee's Circular. It says:
"Perhaps the best evidence that better
! times are with us. and that an improve
ment In real estate sales and prices may
j now be looked for, exists in the fact that
laborers and mechanics of all kinds are
so busy that it is difficult to get enough
of them to do the work on hand. A prom
inent builder said last month that he had
hunted for a day to find two hodcarriers.
Planing mills, foundries, brickyards and
hardware houses are all pushed to exe
cute orders on time, and are so crowded
that they seldom succeed. Certain work
on a store, for the execution of which
I thirty days were thought to be ample,
: will not be finished Inside of sixty days.
There Is no speculation or over-building
: In what is going on; it is but legitimate
growth and advance that causes it. But
for the excessively high price of all build
j ing materials, of iron and brick work
â  especially, much more work would be
under way. Materials of iron and steel
have gone up 65 per cent and brick from
,$6 to $9 50 per thousand. The good time
coming has long been lame in both feet,
' short of breath, wheezy and therefore
! slow-paced, but events have acted like a
good liniment and a cure all, and desir
i able, and we hope permanent, progress
: la at last being made."
Referring to the condition of the real
| estate market the circular says:
"There were few large transactions In
i city real estate In August; medium priced
I transactions prevailed, ranging in value
j from $5000 to 110,000 mostly. Many lots
! worth $1500 to $4000 were also sold. The
localities in which these latter lots were
sold were mostly on Presidio Heights
and between vallejo, Union. Fillmore and
Broderick. Five sales were made on
Union, between Devisadero and Brod
! erk-k, an unusual number in one month.
"There is some demand for lots on
â â  First and Second, between Mission and
I Folsom. Lots on Mission, between Fre
j mont and Third, can be sold, but at rea
! sonable prices only. 'Warehouse and fac
; tory lots on Brannan and Townsend, be
tween Third and Sixth, are being some
what inquired after. There is better .In
quiry for lots by the Panhanuie of the
] park. These lots have the best car ac
commodations of any suburban district
! of the city. The street work is all done,
I the neighborhood well built up and prices
j are exceedingly low. An increase of prices
i there may reasonably be looked for. The
total number of sales made In August
| was 228 of the value of $1,340,846."
Banks and private capitalists took in
; more money last month than they loaned.
i The total number of mortgages was 2%.
of the value of $1,254,523; 220 releases of
! mortgages were recorded, aggregating
1 $1,390,710. Although the Hlbernla Bank is
I now lending at C per cent, it paying the
mortgage tax, It only lent $632,400 in Au
! gust, wnlle it released $711,750. The Ger
man Bank last month' lent $100,000 more
I than it released, while the Savings Union
I lent $83,100 and released only $39,425. The
! loans of the building associations and pri
vate capitalists amounted to an aggregate
of $321,905. and that was $SO,OOO leas than
was released by them.
Money continues to pour Into the banks,
and although tthe total loans of 11,234,080
i in August were the largest of any month
i this year, and the savings bank rate for
I money on realty has been practically es
tablished at 6 per cent, the. releases In
August exceeded the loans and amounted
to $1 3G4,355, against $961,329 for a corre
; sponding month in IS9S, and $670,351 for the
i same month In 1807.
The amount loaned on real estate by the
! banks, loan associations and private capi
talists was $.321,906. against 1246,575. The
ploded. Another of the same tenor was
read from James D. Phelan, who prom
ised to concel the bonds of the Phelan
estate. The names of Mackay and Flood
were then mentioned, and President Har
rison assured the members that these
men had promised to cancel their big I
blocks of bonds if the club members
would take a small burden on their own
backs and go into their own pockets. If
they would pass the proposed amendment
Mr. Harrison pledged that the $2*t,oiX> debt
would be paid and the bonded indebted

DESTROYING FOOD FISH.
San Joaquin River Infested With
Many Illegal Fishermen.
Deputy Fish and Game Commissioner
Kercheval has been making things lively
for the illegal fishers up the San Joaquin
River. A week <>r so ago he and Deputy
0. A. Vogelsang destroyed a wire fence
Obstruction In the river in Stanislaus
County. A few days ago Kercheval found
a similar obstruction in the same
river below San Joaquin City. It
\\;.s constructed with a bagnet
In the middle. so that every
fish running either way was sure to be
caufrVit. This time the deputy was fortu
nate in discovering the owners of the fish
trap, which was on the land of a man
named Gerlaeh. The illegal fishers were
Frank Winters and A. J. White of Crows
Landing and < '. L. Toyer of Lathrop.
They were taken to Stockton, a distance
of thirty odd miles, and thrown into the
jail In default of bail. Their cases will
be heard to-morrow before Justice
Clarker. On the 9th inst. Kercheval found
a:. nT her wire fish trap In the river near
Crows Landing which was similar to the
others. Any one of the three traps was
enough to ruin the run of salmon and
shad by preventing spawning in the head
waters of the stream. Every effort will
be madf by the commission to convict and
punish the culprits as a warning to others
who hold the fish and game laws lightly
there.

LITTLE GIRL'S
CRUEL DEATH
MAKES TROUBLE
Undertakers Write to
Supervisors.
â Â« â
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, Sept. 11.
The burial of the infant daughter of the
Chrlstiansons of Berkeley, who was
burned to death last week in a grass fire,
brought out a new phase of the keen com
petition between undertakers that has
been maintained for years in this city. A
firm of Berkeley undertakers sent the fol
lowing letter to the Supervisors:
Offlflce of Durcfn & Hleakley, Berkeley. ;
Sept. i, 1899.â To the Honorable Board of !
Supervisors of Alameda County: On the Oth of ;
September a little child, Alma Chrit-tianson,
was so badly burned that she soon died. We
(I)urgin & Hleakley) were called In to take
charge of the funeral arrangements ami In
formed the family that an Inquest would be ;
necessary. While there, the deputy coroner,
notified by Ã¼b, i-arne in and made arrangements ]
for the inquest, telling the family that as soon
as the Inquest was over we cuuld go on with j
the funeral arrangements.
With this information we secured from Mr.
Mitchell orders on the county for supplies for ;
burial and for grave, as the futility Is*, as far ;
as we could learn, practically penniless. After
the inquest Dr. Mehrmunn telephoned to us
that he had turned the case over to another
undertaking firm, as it was a Coroner and I
county case and neither we nor the- family had
any rights.
We were just going dawn at the time and
thought we would learn the reason for the I
change. We knew that while we might have :
no particular hold, still the family does have a ;
right as had always been conceded.
The family told us this: That they still |
wlphed us to take charge, but they had been ,
offered a funeral by the Coroner an.l Deputy
Coroner, not only at the county's expense, but
with two hacks also free, and said if we could I
do the same they should still prefer us.
We told tiiem that we would Secure a grave, I
furnish a coffin, etc., free of expense to the
county, but il|d not feel like furnishing two !
hacks, and also telephoned to Supervisor Mit
chell that we would bury free from expense to
the county. Reepf-rtfiilly submitted.
DUROIN & BLEAKI/EY,
P. B.â At the request of Mr. Mitchell we re
turned orders to Mr. Mitchell.
Supervisor Mitchell explained the mat
ter to the board and said that when the
family, who were penniless, had given ;
their consent to the burial by the Coroner.
they did so because he offered carriages
and* everything else free.
A discussion followed as to whether the
Coroner should be paid for the funeral of
the little Indigent, and it was agreed to !
wait to see if a bill were presented.
It is said to be the practice of several
undertakers to gratuitously provide many
things for the funerals of indigents, which
are largely In excess of the allowance
made by thp county in such cases.

CYCLERS POSTPONE
THE RACE FOR A CUP
The annun! twenty-mPe race of the As
sociated Cycling Clubs, scheduled for
next Sunday, has been postponed for
three weeks. Chairman W. 1... Loos of
the racing board states that.this action
was rendered necessary because the San
Leandro triangle course over which the
| race is annually run is at present torn
j up by contractors who are laying sewer
I pipes. The date has therefore been
| changed to October 8. Tlii.s will give the
i various teams an opportunity for more
training and should result in a better
race, particularly If a ruin falls to lay the
dust.
The rules governing the race have been
issued by Chairman \V. L. Loos of the
racing board. They differ In one material
respect from those of previous years, .n
! the clause, "Unlimited pacing is al-
I lowed." This privilege is orlti tne <.i UDS
have been seeking for some time in all
the association inter-club events, and the
. forthcoming race will evidence whether a
race conducted with unlimited pacing la
: equally fair to all the clubs.
The Reno Wheelmen have challenged
1 the Acme Wheelmen to a ilfty-mile relay
â  race to be held on the Reno track on Bun
-1 day, tho -4th lnst., and the Acmes have
I accepted.
Secretary E. N. Cretgh has sent out
: ballots for the annual election of the Bay
City Wheelmen, to be held on the 15th
inst. The nominating committee is still
busy trying to explain to the members at
large why it turned down some of the
best men in the club for the sake of giv
: Ing office to three of Its own committee
! and their Intimate friends. A futile at
tempt was made to strengthen the ticket
by putting on it the names of four old
directors, two of whom have passed their
! usefulness anil the other two are not
1 seeking the honor. As a whole the "regu
/ lar ticket" is far from satisfactory to a
I majority of the members, but there is not
sufficient interest taken In the club now
adays to afford any probability of an op
position ticket.
The California Cycling Club is far more
prosperous than its quiet demeanor of
late would signify. The larger clubs have
thought that the Californians were fol
lowing the San Franclscos and Imperials
i down the "toboggan." but on the con
; trary the big Mission organization has
! been merely cleaning out its delinquent
i members and is on a strong, paving
basis. The lease on the club rooms at
I Folsom and Twenty-second s.reets has
recently been renewed for six years and
preparations for socials and road events
; are now being made. The club boasts of
having sent more men to Manila during
the war than any other cycling organiza
tion in the city. Six of them gave their
; services to the country: C. Holneman, C.
B. Thorp. Q. Seyfried. A. Loudeman. E.
Ward and John Uurke. Burke was pax
ticulnrly prominent in cyel.ng affairs
: here. He enlisted in the Third Artillery
and on his return, together with his fel
lows, will be given a warm reception.
Captain R. A. Coulter has recently been
elected secretary, vice William Reid, re
signed because of absence from the city.

CONTEST BEGUN OVER
THE DUNMIRE ESTATE
IGNORED NEXT OF KIN NOW
DEMAND SHARES.
OAKLAND, Sept. 11.â Mary Randall
and John York to-day filtd their threat
ened contest over the estate of their
sister, Kate Y. Dunrr.tre, who died in this
city on August 15 last, objecting to the
probate of the will filed recently by W. K.
Barnard, who is named as executor in
the instrument. In the alleged will Mrs.
Dunmire disposes of her estate, valued at
over $10,000, but her next of kin, the con
testants, are wholly Ignored, testatrix ex
plaining that they "have sufficient of this
world's goods."
Contestants assail that will on the
ground that if the instrument was ever
signed by deceased, the subscription
thereto was not made in the presence <->f
any attesting witness; that at the lime
Mrs. Dunmire was not of sound mind and
that she was incompetent to make a will;
being at times unconscious owing to her
great suffering from an affection uf the
Contestats further allege that at the
time of making said will Mrs. Dunmire
was acting under fraud and undue in
fluence of Mrs. Ursula L. Platt. one of
the legatees but no relative of decadent,
and that decedent, when in health, often
expressed her dislike for said in
who with certain other parties, contest
ants believe, "designedly, and m > oiitra
\ ention of the expressed wishes and de
sires of decedent, inserted m said pre
tended will the false statement that other
relatives of dacedent were well provided:
for In property they now own.
Contestants ask that the estate be dis
tributed to them according to their legal
rights, as if there were no will.
WEIRD TALE OF
DISTANT MURDER
OAKLAND, Sept. 11.â Fred Nelson, a
lad 15 years old, who was arrested last
night in company with a tramp named
Oliver Lavigne, has told the police a sen
sational story that has all the earmarks
of a dime novel.
This is Nelson's narrative:
"I met Lavigne In Nebraska in August.
1898. My parents are dead and when
he asked me to accompany him I readily
consented, a 8 he told me how easy it was
to make a living on the road and bow
much better it was than working for any
body. We left Nebraska together and I
begged for my companion along the road.
"All went well until we reached Lara
mie, Wyo. It was some time in Septem
ber,' J think, and we were boih waiting in
the railroad yard for a train to pull out.
Suddenly a boy about my own age climbed
out from the truck of a car near us and
Frenchy recognized in him a lad who had
been his beggar before he got me. There
were some words between the two, and
Frencny pulled his knife and commenced
stabbing the boy. When the little fellow
fell Frenchy picked up a coupling-pin and,
without saying a word, crushed the boy's
skull. Then he threw the pin away, said
â¢Come on' and we lied in the darkness.
Since then we have been ruining West all
the time, and have been in many jails, bui
there was never any question about the
crime In the Laramie railroad yards. A
few days ago Frenchy picked up another
boy in 'San Francisco named Joseph Wil
son and 1 then thought it would be my
turn next. That is why I said when ar
rested that I was glad to be taken.
Lavigne laughs at the boy s tale, but
Chief Hodgkins will investigate.
J.AKAMIK. Wyo.. Sept. 11.-The story
told by Fred Nelson at Oakland, Cal., of
the murder of a boy here in September,
1898, is denied by the police and coroner.
Tluy say no murder was committed here
ut the time mentioned.
CUT IN HALVES BY
A FREIGHT TRAIN
OAKLAND, Sept. 11.â Laurence Souya,
a boy 7 years old, was cut in halves by a
freight train this evening. Death was
instantaneous. The lad was crossing the
track at First and Chester streets, which
id in the vicinity of a cannery in which
his mother was working. lie got off the
track on which the Alameda local was
approaching, but in doing so stepped on
a track on which a freight was Lacking.
The brake-man on the freight train sig
naled to the engineer to stop instantly.
He obeyed the signal, but not before one
pair of trucks had passed over young
Souya. Another lad was playing with
Souya and when he saw the freight he
laid or was knocked down in the middle
of the track and escaped with a slight
wound on the neck.
MEMBERS GET ACQUAINTED.
New Deaf, Dumb and Blind Board
Holds a Short Session.
OAKLAND, Sept. 11.â The new board
of directors of the Institution for the
Deaf, Dumb and the Blind at Berkeley
held a brief session to-night, President
George W. Reed, Brewton A. Hayne and j
John H. Grindley being present, Henry
Pierce and William S. Wells absent. No
changes were made and there was but j
one application for position, that of M.
K. Iloughton of 533 lay street, Oakland,
for appointment as watchman.
The meeting appeared to be more for
the purpose of giving the new members
of the board an opportunity of familiariz
ing themselves with the business methods
employed in the management of the in- ;
stitution, and this feature was compre
hensively explained by the superin
tendent. Warring Wilkinson.
The Institution now receives a monthly
appropriation from the State of J4H7O W.
and its pay-roll aggregates 53100 monthly
for both administrative and educational
departments. Its only other source of
revenue is $300 annual tuition received
from each of those pupils outside the
State, there being at present, among the
â¢>lO enrolled, seven from Nevada and thrre
from Arizona. Superintendent Wilkinson
explained also that the letting of con
tracts for supplies every three months
instead of yearly has proved most ad
vantageous.
Formerly the institution did nearly all
of its printing, but the last Legislature
provided that all printing must be per
formed at the State Printing Office, so
that at present only the California News,
the asylum paper, is printfil at home.

"STRICTLY BUSINESS,"
SAYS EXPERT WILLIAR
Explains His Transactions With
Gedge and Conlon.
Man Who Boasts of Bribe-Taking Hires a
Bodyguard â Secretary Simpson At
tempts to Cover Up School Board
Crookedness.
THE School Board scandal Is now up
to the Grand Jury, which will be
Impaneled to-day by Judge Daln
gerfield. District Attorney Murphy
says that he has no official Informa
tion of any crookedness, and will
not take action In the matter until he
lias, but asserts that there Is no ques
tion but that the charges published in
The Call will be among the first matters
that the Inquisitorial body will take up.
Director Gedge, who so boldly acknowl
edged his crookedness, found It con
t yesterday to seek the protection
of a bodyguard to spare him the embar
rassment of answering many pertinent
questions the newspaper reporters were
anxious to put to him. The guard occu
pied the outer apartment of the doctor's
B. The tfrst thing he wished to as
certain from every caller was If he was
a reporter. An answer in the affirmative
elicited the Information that the School
Director, who ndmits that he accepts
bribes, was not In. Further than this the
guard would say nothing.
J. J. Conlon, Gedge's colleague, whom
the latter says received a share of the
money, will not admit that he Is a

thing of the kind. He says that life Is too
short to pay any attention to stories pub-
I in the newspapers, and that he has
mnde up his mind not to worry about
them. According to what he is reported
to have Bald, he Is fairly aching for aJi
Investigation.
H. R. Williar, the expert, whose name
has been connected with the School
scandal, was seen yesterday at his

BALDWIN TO BE SOLD OUT.
The Baldwin Hotel site, held by its
owner at a valuation of $3,000,000. will be
sold under the hammer by Sheriff Martin
on October 3 to satisfy a judgment of
eleven hundred and some odd dollars, un
less K. J. Baldwin succeeds In raising the
isary cash to liquidate the claim of
Ickelheimer Bros., plumbers, at 20 Geary
street, before that date. Legal notice to
that eff.ct was published yesterday and
the Sheriff must sell Baldwin's interest in
the property, unless a settlement is made
before the time mentioned.
Baldwin, it appears, has been pro-rating
all the money he could get hold of among
his more persistent creditors ever since
the fire that destroyed the hotel. Ickel
heimer Bros., however, were not among
ihe forunate ones and all they could get
was promises. They finally assigned their
claim to Attorney Joseph EC Sien. with
Instructions to bring suit against their
debtor. Judgment oy default was ren
dered agalnsi Baldwin on April 27 of this
year, and an attachment levied on all real
estate owned by him in this city.
Before Baldwin departed for the Santa
Anita ranch ten days ago he was waited
f ,n by Attorney Bien and Informed that
the judgment must be satisfied at once or
the 'hotel property would be sold. Bald
win replied that he had no money, but
expected to be able to liquidate the claim
upon his return from the south. 1 ;â¢:â !
heimer Bros, were incensed at the manner
in which they had be. :i treated, however,
and the judgment was placed in the hands
of the Sheriff, with instructions to sell
the hot--! property under attachment.
Attorney Bien saiu last night that the
Bale would surely take place as advertised
unless the claim was paid.

Death of A. S. Barney.
Alfred S. Barney, grandson of the late
Colonel J. D. Stevenson, died yesterday
at the Waldeck Hospital as the result of
an operation for appendicitis. Deceased
was 46 years of age and a native of Nan
tucket. He had lived in California since
1875 and for many years had charge of
the' office business of Colonel Stevenson,
when the latter was United Slates Ship
ping Commissioner. He leaves a widow
and one daughter. Miss Marion Barney,
who is a member of the Frawley com

not treat, for I never get business in that
way.
"I am willing to admit that that partic
ular brand of paper is manufactured by
the firm that I represent on this coast. ;
Brown & Powers did not ask me to fur- |
nish them with that brand, so that they
could comply with the specifications in
making: their bid. I do not know either
member of the firm, but had they come to i
me it would have done them no pood, for |
1 would not have sold them any of the
paper called for. "We manufacture it as j
a special brand for Payot, Upham & Co., j
and it would not be business courtesy for
us to sell it to a firm that was going to j
bid against our customer."
The altered specifications are being i
carefully guarded by the secretary of the
Board of Education. Mr. Simpson is pre
sumed to be aware of the fact that they
are public documents and open to public
inspection, but to head off a possible de- j
mand to scrutinize the tell-tale papers he ;
conveniently stays away from his office, j
According to the statements of Simpson's
deputies the machinery of his department
reaches a full stop whenever he passes
out through the front door. He is the |
whole thing, and his deputies can not
even sneeze without he takes the snuff.
If Mr. Simpson is the only pebble on the j
beach it behooves him to stay where he ;
belongs, and give a little of his attention
to the business which his deputies are !
afraid to transact.
A demand to see the specifications yes
terday met with a refusal. The deputies
stated that Mr. Simpson. was out and that j
in his absence they would not dare to al- |
low the inspection of any public docu- .
ment. Mr. Simpson may have no interest
in keeping from the public information !
concerning the. latest school board
scandal, but, even though he is reported
to have told his friends that Gedge was
all right, his actions in the matter are j
somewhat peculiar, to say the least.
The appended communication has been
received from Cunningham, Curtiss &
Welch. The statement referred to was
made by School Director Kemp, but it is
evident from the stationery firm's expla
nation that Kemp was enjoying one of his
alcoholic trances at the time:
The firm of Cunningham, Curtiss & "U>lch

First Verdict of the Jury Not Ap

of Death From Natural
Causes Received.
Coroner Hill held an inquest yesterday
morning upon the body of Mrs. R. de la
Fontaine of 1321 Natoma street, who died
last Friday morning. The deceased had
been attended by Mrs. Achard, .1 mid
wife, who had administered some simple
remedy to relieve vomiting. The autopsy
showed that cirrhosis of the liver had
: death and that there were no cvi
â  of malpractice or of even any ne
cessity for it.
Mrs. Achard testified that in her ex
â¢ of thirty-eight years as a mid
wife Mrs. de la Fontaine was the only
patient who had died i.i her care, biie
bad suggested that a physician should be
called, but Mrs. de la Fontaine refused
to allow one to be summon- d, as she did
not believe her condition to be serious.
The jury returned a verdict that death
bad been caused by neglect, on the part
of some person unknown, to summon
cal ass, stance, bin the Coroner re
fused to approve of the verdict and the
â  use was reopened and additional evi
dence Introduced.
Autopsy Surgeon Zabala assured the
jury that death was due to disease and
even if a physician had been called in a
few days before her death It waa
doubtful whether he could have bucc li d
in saving her life.
The jury returned a verdict of death
from natural causes, and the verdict was
approved.

KELLY IS STILL
AWAITING TRIAL
IN MEXICO
Chief Lees Informed
of His Crime.
CAPTURED AFTER A CHASE
â¦
A MYSTEBIOTJS WOMAN BEING
SOUGHT FOB.
â¦
It Is Claimed That She Assisted in
the Now Famous Robbery of
the Box of Sovereigns
From the Alameda.
Chief Lees yesterday received a letter
from the Chief of Police of the City of
Mexico corroborating: the story that Kelly,
alias Kilty, alias Watson, who Is wanted
for complicity In the robbery of the specie
room of the Alameda, was under arrest
there for snatching (10,000 from a depositor
in the National Bank. The letter stated
that Kelly's victim had placed the amount
on the counter preparatory to depositing
it, when the Australian crook, after dis
tracting his attention, grabbed the bunch
of greenbacks and ran from the bank. He
was pursued for three Mocks and finally!
caught in an unoccupied house, where he
had taken rtfuge. The stolen bills were
found on him. His trial will come up next
month. The writer of the letter informed
Chief Lees that Kelly was doomed to
serve at least Biz years for the crime.
It is known that Detectives Gibbon and
Ellis are anxious to find a woman who
was a passenger on the Alameda when the
strongbox was robbed. Her identity is
wrapped in the deepest mystery, but it is
known that the police are making every
effort to tind her. It was first thought
that the mysterious woman was the wife
Of Kellv, but later developments show
tbat the latt. r was not aboard the Ala
meda when the st> amer was robbed. Two
other men, who are said to be Australian
crooks and whose true names are not
known, are also being sought for by the
police. It is claimed that they assisted in
getting away with the "swag."
They accompanied Murphy to Australia
and are supposed to be in the Antipodes
at tiie present time. Chief I.ees admits
that he has placed himself in communica
tion with the Australian authorities with
a view of apprehending the much-wanted
crooks, and expects to have them in his
clutches within a short time.

A TALENTED SINGER
RETURNS FROM ABROAD
MISS CLARA KALISHER.
MISS CLARA KALJSHER, a talented singer, who has been studying
abroad, returned to this city a few days ago. The young lady is well
known in local musical circles, where her voice has charmed all who
have heard her sing. Miss Kalisher is. the possessor of a contralto
voice of great depth and purity. She has been in Paris and London
during the past four years, cultivating it under M. Jules Granier, G. W. Hen
schel and Henry J. Wood, a well-known orchestra loader.
Miss Kalisher won great applause from one of the most critical and se
lect audiences in London when she sang at the concert given in honor of the
Queen's birthday last May in St. James Hall, Regent street.
She has received many excellent offers both for operatic and concert work
in Europe and New York. She is to appear in the American metropolis this
season with Paur's Symphony Orchestra.
The following flattering notice was given the young lndy by Le Matin, a
leading daily of Paris: "Mile. Kalisher, the young American singer, whose
beautiful voice and incomparable diction have been so much admired this
winter at the most select musicales, has just left here for the London sea
son."
LARKSPUR CITIZENS
DENOUNCE A SLANDER
Another Examiner Fake Made
From Whole Cloth.
Reputable Young Men Reviled and Estima
ble Women Slandered to Gratify a
Petty Personal Spite,
to
- attract the attention of the people
I of Larkspur to its existence. Last
A Sunday it succeeded. Almost an en
-*- tire page of its meretriciously
colored supplement was given
over to an account of a so-called
"bacchanalian revel" in the redwoods of
â Baltimore Canyon, in which according to
the writer,
Five hundred men and women
enjoyed themselves, with little or no
restraint, many of them behaving
like the creatures of the Nymphia,
drank like Bacchanalian Satyrs,
danced the can-can and the couchee
couchee, dispensed with bathing
suits at the bath, caroused all night
| and made the peaceful redwoods re
sound with their unseemly jests and
songs.
Until the attention of the dwellers at
Larkspur was called to the article they
were not aware that such a state of af
fairs has existed for three months In
their midst. They did not know that
satyrs had become so up-to-date a 6to
dance' the couchee-couchee and the un
canny can-can right under their noses
without being noticed. They did not
Imagine that Amaryllis, multiplied an
hundred fold, had recklessly displayed
lingerie unfit for publication even in the
unspeakable Examiner.
They were horrified at the state of af
fairs "set forth in the head lines: they
were shocked at the Police Gazette
pictures that accompanied the article;
they were absolutely dumfounded when
they read the conglomeration of mixed
metaphor, sophomoric striving, bad taste
and worse English that followed. It took
them fully twenty-four hours to recover.
When they did they exclaimed with one
voice:
"It's another page of Examiner lies!"
That was self evident, but the people of
Larkspur were at a loss to understand
why that paper should single out their
llttlo paradise, for pollution from its
ulimy presence. A little inquiry satisfied
them on that point. Robert D. Duke,
who has made Larkspur his home for
seven summers, and who, Immediately on
the publication of the story, sent a letter
to The Call refuting the slander, let
them into the secret of the attack.
"That story was written," he said, "by
F. Bailey Millard, the Sunday editor of
the Examiner, to vent a personal spite
he has against the members of Occidental
camp. There is not a word of truth in
it from beginning to end. It's all lies and
fake and even if ihe Examiner can af
ford to be used in that manner, to
slander good men and defame the char
acters of the women of Larkspur, I do
not propose to let tho matter rest.
"The reason Millard wrote, or had writ
ten, and inserted that article in the Ex
aminer is as plain as a pikestaff. He has
a residence and a couple of acres of
ground at the head of Baltimore Canyon.
About 200 yards from him was Occidental
camp, the ground for which was leased
to the young men by Foster Azevedo. Mil
lard's premises are supplied with water
from a spring on the Forbes-Coleman
tract, controlled under lease by Azevedo,
who charges Millard $4 a year for the sup
ply. Under their lease from Azevedo the
Occidental campers were also supplied
with water from the spring.
"Some time ago Millard, who seems to
dislike til.- Occidental campers, wrote
them a letter saying if they did not pay
him $4 for the use of the water he would
send around a plumber to shut off the
supply. He accused them of felony in
I using It and threatened them with term 3
|in San Quentin. All this, mind you, when
I he had not the slightest shadow of owner
j ship In the spring, for the use of the water
I of which the campers were paying Az>i
| vedo, the lessee. The members of the
i camp laid the matter before Azevedo,
who, having been vexed previously by the
eccentricities of Millard, resolved to shut
him off from the spring and gave him no
tice that he would do so on September 1.
"Now, for the animus of last Sunday's
article in the Examiner. Millard, who dts
i played such eagerness to get $4 from Oc
cidental camp for water he did not own
found that, as soon as Azevedo cut off his
supply from the spring, he would have to
go to an expense of several hundred dol
lars to connect with the Larkspur sys
tem. He laid it all to the Occidental b.pys
and, if you will notice, he lays it on thick
when he refers to them.
"As a reporter for the Examiner he
calls thf-m 'vandals,' 'hoodlums,' 'dissi
pated wretches.'
"Under the guise of 'a cottager' he re
fers to their camp as a place where 'it
seemed as if hades had broken loose.'
"As 'a resident of Baltimore Canyon,
who lives on the hillside just above the
camp grounds.' he calls them 'young
Cools' and 'hoodlums rampant.'
"As the whole trinity of complainers, the
cottager, reporter, resident rolled into
one, he says they yawped and bawled and
yelled and held awful orgies. In every
line he lies. In every line ne is trying to
g*-t even for the expense his own busy
body methods have put him to. To show
you part of the falsehood in the story
1 will give you the names of the members
of Occidental camp. Will he dare come
out in print and accuse any one or all of
these young men of being hoodlums ram
pant, or of being participants in such
orgies as he describes? Hardly. Here
are the names." Mr. Duke handed over
a paper containing the following:
Will Moore, business manager of the
Monitor.
George Hammersmith, with Thomas
Mapee & Sons.
Arthur Baring, with C. Craig & Co.
Ernest Furst, with W. W. Montague
& Co.
William Wilson, in the United States
engineers' office.
James H. Wheeler, with Brown Bros.
Dr. William C. liopper, former assist
ant police surgeon and captain of Com
pany A, League of the Cross Cadets.
Louis Haven, with Lilienthal & Co.
Harry Hopper, with the Deere Imple
mf-nt Company.
William Judge, with Bauer Bros.
Chris Bernhard, with Sherwood & Sher
wood.
Edward Moore, with the City of Paris.
Philip J. Eisenman, with Dunham, Car
rigan & Hayden.
Herbert Ely, secretary of the Yukon
Mining and Trading Company.
Harry Wood Brown, teacher of vocal
culture.
Charles Hopkins, with Payot, Upham
&. Co.
"If these young men are hoodlums,"
continued Mr. Duke, "I'd like to know
whert you get your gentlemen? Maybe
Millard can explain. If they are hoodlums
the people of Larkspur will be glad to
have thefn next summer, as they had
them last, to visit Occidental camp and to
entertain the boys at their homes. Do
you think that any one reading that list
of names would believe fur a moment the
story written by the spiteful Millard?"
Several members of the Occidental Club
also voiced their disgust yesterday at the
urticle.
"It's worse than the Police Gazette,"
said James H. Wheeler.
"He couldn't even let our piano alone
without maligning it," said Will Wilson.
"Called it 'that old discordant music ma
chine.' It was brand new, at that."
" 'Bacchanalian orgies,' sounds strange,"
said Will Moore of the Monitor, "espe
cially when one knows, as 1 know, that
the must stringent rule of Occidental
camp was the one forbidding the use of
liquor. None ot the party are drinking
men and at no time was there a disposi
tion to violate the rule. As Mr. Duke says,
Mr. Millard, or whoever was the writer of
that article, is using the Examiner to vent
a personal spite. In doing so he has re
viled the characters of gentlemen and de
famed estimable women.
"Mr. Millard has taken occasion before
to interfere with Occidental camp. We
rented the ground, water included, from
Mr. Azevedo for the season. We made our
connections with the pipe and a week or
two later received a lengthy letter from
Mr. Millard in which he stated that in
using the water we were committing a
felony and were, therefore, liable to be
sent to San Quentin. He also said we
were not gentlemen in not having con
sulted him.
"As we did not recognize Millard in the
premises we ignored his letter. About
three nights later he visited our camp
and we told him then that we did nut
want to have anything to do with him;
that we didn't rent tne grounds from
him, and that if he had a grievance he
could go and have it out with Azevedo.
1 do not Know whether or not he went to
Azevedo, but when 1 saw Azevedo 1 told
him of Millard's visit. He was very much
put out about it. lie immediately doubled
the price of the watej; to .Millard and gave
him notice that it would be disconnected
after the Ist of September.
â¢â¢Millard. who \\:is only paying $4 a year
for his water, stnt us a lull for $4 for the
season for use of water in our camp and
told us that unless the bill was paid he
would send his plumber to disconnect the
water.
"As far as the story in the Examiner of
the 'Bacchanalian revels' is concerned,
â¢â¢ill I can say is that 1 knew nothing about
any such proceedings and never heard of
them until my attention was called to tho
story. 1 certainly would have known had
they taken place, and so would a number
of others at Larkspur. So far I have
been unable to locale any one who saw
them. 1 know, however, that the young
men of Occidental camp are gentlemen;
that they were gladly received in all the
homes of Larkspur, and that on one oc
casion during the summer they gave a
minstrel performance for a church and
raised $325. That does not look like the
action of Bacchanalian revelers."
Mr. Moore referred the reporter for The
Call to the residents of Larkspur for a
refutation of the Examiner slander on
Occidental camp and for certificates of
the general character of the members of
that camp.
"As far as T know." said James Cos
tello of O'Connor, Moffatt & Co., a prom
inent resident of Larkspur, "the young
men of Occidental camp are gentlemen
They have that general reputation, at any
rate. As, far as the story in the Exam
iner, of which they complain, all 1 can
say is that 1 never heard of any such go
ings on. My observation of the young
men was that they wre neither noisy nor
hoodlumish and always conducted them
selves properly."
"It's a rank fakeâ a pack of fakes "
said Anton Shula, whose handsome resi
dent is as close to Occidental Camp as
that of Millard. "The Idea of the whole
yarn is preposterous. No better hehaved
young men ever camped at Larkspur "
The opinions of a number of others were
to the same effect. All accused Millard of
a palpable attempt to use his paper to
vent a personal spite. Not one was found
who had ever seen the alleged petition
which, according to the same story, was
being circulated for signatures to be
presented to the owners of tho land ask
ing them to refuse campers permission to
occupy grounds in Baltimore Canyon. The
suspicion is that Millard, or some one
under his direction, manufactured the pe
tition out of the same piece of cloth from
which the whole story was cut. They are
confident that, if ever presented, it will be
signed by
"A COTTAGER,"
"A RESIDENT ON THE HILLSIDE"
"AN EXAMINER REPORTER."
In support of the suspicion that Millard
was moved to publish the story by the
unsuccessful issue of his first deal in
water, is the fact that its publication
coincides with the conclusion of his water
lease from Azevedo. According to his
own story, the revel had been in progress
for the preceding three months. Amaryl

He not only did that, but to support ,

they desecrated the sacred shores of

THOMPSON BRIDGE CO.
SECURES THE CONTRACT
TWO FERRY SLIPS AND WHARF
FOR THE VALLÂ£Y ROAD
Resume of the Work in Progress and
That Which Remains to Be
Accomplished on the New
Line.
Yesterday the directors of the Valley
Rood placed the contracts for the ferry
structures at Point Richmond with the
Thompson Bridge Company.
These contracts call for the construc
tion, â within a reasonable time, of two
ferry slips and a wharf which will ex
tend from Point Richmond 800 feet into
the waters of the bay. One of the slips
will be used for the passenger boat which
will run from its Point Richmond termi
nal to the Union ferry slip at the foot of
Market street in this city. The second
slip will be utilized for freight. There
the cars will be loaded on floats which
will carry them to the company's depot
at the foot of Bryant street.
From Antioeh, hatf way between Stock
ton and Point Richmond, the road is now
being pushed toward the Alhambra Val
ley, at the upper end of which will be
erected the much talked of 1700 foot, steel
viaduct. Between these points are situ
ated the five tunnels which have all been
put through and on which the workmen
are now busy with the timbering.
The rails have been laid two miles west
of Stockton to the San Joaquin River,
over which the bridge has already been
erected, and is so near completion that
another week will see the track laid
across it. When this is done the work
will, be rushed over the twelve miles tnat
intervene between the stream and the
Middle River. Though the bridge across
this waterway is well along, it will prob
ably be over a month before it is finished.
Trade Unions Jubilant.
Trade unions all over the city are
jubilant over the prosperous condition of
the labor market, together with the fact
that wages have been kept at the
standard rates. Carpenters, painters,
bricklayers and stonesetters are finding
all they can do in and about the city.
The union rates and the eight-hour rules
are being obeyed, and as a consequence
there are no murmurings at the union
meetings. The last of the unions that had
a difficulty In getting employers to recog
nize the established rate of wages was
the painters, but now they have but very
few complaints against uoss employers.
An active employment market adds num
bers to the roll of Initiated members at
every night's meeting. As an example of
this increase in new members, Painters'
Union No. 73 initiated twenty-three mem
bers at its meeting last night and re
ferred eighteen applications to Investigat
ing committees. A corresponding increase
can be noted with the Carpenters' Union
and, in fact, with all other unions.
The principal trouble of the organized
unions at present is that of getting the
T'nlted States Government to smooth the
way on work on the transport vessels
which are being fitted out and undergoing
constant repairs at the Union Iron
Works. Between the contractors and the
Government agents the workmen are un
decided as to who is responsible for vio
lating the eight-hour law as passed by
Congress, and they are still trying to
solve the puzzle.
