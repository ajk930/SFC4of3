Special r>iapatrh to ThÂ« Call.
There seems to be even less
than the usual excuse for the dis
astrous tram wreck on the South- i
crn Pacific on Monday morning.
A special, carrying delegates io
the meeting of the National Edu
cational Association, sent out by i
the Burlington rjad, but having i
the right of way, crashed into a
freight train on the main line at a
regular station â a train which by
all the rules of railroading, and
apparently by its orders, should
.have been safe on a siding ten
m.les away. This was a gross
blunder, in giving or in receiving
orders.
Worse even than this, in making
up the special the Southern Pacific
opera: ing department violated the
oldest rule of railroading by put
ting a light tourist sleeper next
to the engine without the custom- j
ary protection of a baggage car
to shield the sleeper in case of
just such an accident as this.
When the collision came, death to
some of those in the sleeper was
inevitable. The tender of the
locomotive, with the force of the
whole momentum of the moving
tram, was driven back through the
tourist car. It is little short of
marvelous that there were no
more latahties.

morning on tho Southern Pa

of the railway station at this point.
A special, made up of an engine and
â¢ : eight tourist coaehep, carrying dele
gates to the National Educatioi Con
vantion at Los Angeles, running at
forty miles an hour, struck the rear end
of a combination train, which had
â¢ibeen brought to a standstill at the a
r'ter tank. The express shed through
1a baggage and day coach on the train
ahead, smashing these to splinters, and
Betting the wreck on fire. The same
impact telescoped the tender into the
first sleeper of the special, bringing it
up with a jerk that threw every occu
pant out who had not been jammed in
a berth by the crashing of the timbers.
Twenty-two passengers were sound
\ asleep in the telescoped car, and twen-

their lives and a few injuries. Two of ]
them, Mrs. Thomas and Miss Harris, ;
who were in the end berth next to the
tender, were killed outright. Mrs.
Thomas' neck was broken, and Miss
Harris, who faint*-! from the shock,
was asphyxiated from th-- smoke which
; up in volumes from the burning
v\ reck.
Suddenly roused out of their sleep,
thf lights all extinguished and water
pouring in on them from holes in the
tender, the surviving passengers, some
of them pinned sei urely in their berths,
in a frightful state of panic. The
tirst thought of many was tliKi they
plunged through a bridge and
rapidly sinking into the wal
an unknown river. They screamed for
help, until the few that found their
senses struck matches and lit up the

telescoped Bleeper, in which it was sup-;
posed any number of killed were piled
up.
The illumination in the sky brought
out tht- volunteer Fire Department of :
Newman and the men battled bravely,
assisted by the train hands and fully j
recovered passengers, against the on- j
cominy flames.
A new alarm was added by the dis- '
covery that a tank car on a sidetrack >
within a few feet of the blazing wreck
was full of oil and would probably ex
plode at any minute.
The scantily clad passengers who .
had been rescued or made their way j
out of the telescoped Bleeper were so
terrified at the possibility of such an I
occurrence that they scampered, hat l
]>-hk. coatless and barefooted, many of
them, as far away as they could pet :
from Their ill luck.
A call of the mil >>f the occupants <>f
I the car made at this time showed that
half a dozen were not accounted for,
and the rescuers went to work to pet
them out. fully convinced that four or
five dead bodies would be found. Faint
cries from the sleeper gave indications
that one or two of the missing might
be saved.
Axes were used on the top of the
sleeper nearest the tender and the
searchers came upon Miss White,
daughter of Mrs. Lena Thomas, and
Miss May Oliver, both of whom were
wedged in between the tender and the f
roof of their car. Th< y were extricated j
without much difficulty. Miss Edna
Thomas was cut nut of another berth
with a saw.

but not held by any of the crushed
timbers. They were taken out and sent |
tip the undertaking parlors of .Charles
Schank. An examination of Mrs. '
Thomas showed that her neck had been
broken by the end of the tender being
forced Into the berth. Miss Harris, it
is believed, died of fright or by smoke :
asphyxiation. Her face was lacerated j
but not seriously. She was 30 years of
age and Mrs. Thomas about .". The in
jured people were taken to the Russ
House, where they were cared for by
the railroad's surgeons; T>r. Armistead
and I" - . I >owle and Stratton.
While all 6f the unfortunates com- j
plained of various pains and aches. the
physicians state they could not find any
very serious Injuries, bruises, ]â¢â â 
tions and sprains being the majority of
the ailments.
It was daylight before the flames
were extinguished and not till they had
devoured two cars and all the wood
work on the engine.
Of the accident but one story is told
here. The special was coming up the
valley at the rate of forty miles an
hour. Opposite the station on the main
track stood the combination freight
train, its engine at the water tank.
Only six minutes had elapsed since it
had stopped. The station signal light
showed the white, which means "clear
track." The engineer <>f the special
gave the customary two long and two
short blasts of the whistle, and seeing
the white light kept right on. Sudden
ly he epied the stationary train, the air
brakes were applied, the lever was re
versed, but the speed was so great that
nothing could stop the special and a
crash followed.
The special's engine ploughed half
way through the freight train's last car
and the force behind lifted the engine
and hurled it over on its side.
Engineer R. B. Allen and Fireman
W. P. Creigh at this moment jumped
from their stations and wore uninjured.
T'le condition of the station lights is
en using mm h comment. Several of
those who were out at the time of Wi*
collision state that when the freight '
train pulled in it was given the white j
light on the main track to indicate that
everything was clear on these rails.
When the special's whistle for sig
nals was heard a glance In the direc
tion of the station showed that the !
white light for an open and clear track |
still shone brightly, and Watchman J.
H. Madden remarked:
"'I knew that those two trains were j
going to get mixed up and somebody
get hurt."
Station Master Edgar Hartwell was
questioned as to the condition of these
signal lights, but ho declined to discuss
the accident or any of Its feature*. He
' said:
"The station signals were out correct,
and if there is any blame it lies with
those In charge of the trains. My re
port will be made to my superiors and
to no one else."
He declined to even state whether or j
not the red light should have been dis
played with a freight train on the main
track and a through special due at any
moment.
If the story told by Ben Livingston, j
a plumber, and Frank Homer, be true, I
some one disobeyed or failed to under
stand orders. Both reached the wreck
soon after the crash, and near the over
turned engine one found a paper, the
order to the engineer of the excursion
train. In substance it was an instruc
tion for him to pass the freight train
at Inpomar, eight or nine miles ahead,
the freight train being instructed to.go
upon a siding so as to let the special
pass. The same order, so the men say,
mentioned other trains to be passed
during the night and where they would
turn out t" let the excursion train
go by.
Railroad men subsequently got hold
of the engineer's orders.
One of the most remarkable escapes
from death among the many was that
of Calvin Bullock, the porter. He
I went to the front platform for a
breath of fresh air and was obliged to
grasp the railing when the air brakes
were put on. The shock of the first
impact threw " < porter clear off the
cars and high into the air. He landed
all in a heap just outside of the danger
line and sustained only a few sprains
and bruises.
The Coroner came from Modesto and
had the bodies of the victims viewed by
a jury. The inquest will be held on
Moi day at 3 o'clock in the afternoon.
The Injured left for San Francisco.

cases, were too large for their wearers.

daughter of Mrs. Thomas, and Robert B.
Mills, a banker of Lake Preston. S. P.,
' who joined the 111 fated special at Salt
Lake City. All of them told the same
story of the wreck, that threw them out
j or jammed them In their berths, extin-
I guished the lights in the cars and flooded
| the floors with water from the tender.
; They were al! occupants of berths on the
first car of the nine that made up the
special. Which had not the usual baggage
car buffer between it and the engine. The
officials of the Southern Pacific Company
profess to believe that the absence of this
baggage car made no difference as to the
results of the wreck, but they will have a
hard time convincing the passengers of
' that fact. They believe firmly, and it
: seems to stand to reason, that had there
' been a baggage car between the first
j coach and the engine Mrs. Thomas and
Miss Harris would not have been killed.
Mrs. Thomas occupied the berth num
bered lower 14 on the first coach. In up
per 14 was her daughter. Miss White. In
lower 13, just opposite, were Miss Addie
Harris and Miss Oliver. The berth above
them was unoccupied. These berths were
' in the front end of the car, next to the
locomotive tender, and how any of the
occupants escaped with their lives is little
| short of a miracle. The neck of Mrs.
Thomas was broken and her death must
have been instantaneous. Miss Harris'
i body when taken out ''f the wreck showed
i no wounds, and it was supposed for, a
! time in the excitement that she had died
of the shock. The other occupants of the
car are positive now that she was asphyx
iated from the smoke that rolled into the
J car from the burning coaches and engine
j ahead. Her features were badly distorted
and it is certain that she must have died
an awful and a lingering death.
The escape of Miss "White and Miss
Oliver is nothing short of wonderful and
cannot be accounted for. As it was. Miss
White was unable to extricate herself
when help arrived and the lights were lit,
and It was necessary to use axes to set

All stories of the survivors agree that,
after the first confusion following the
crash and the extinguishing of the lights,
there was. not the slightest panic in the
coach. The men behaved like heroes and
th<-> ladies were self-possessed and helpful.
They ;Ui got into what clothing they could
find In the darkness, intensified by the
striking of matches, and sloshed around
in the water and out on the earth as
quickly as possible, the blaze from the
fiercely burning cars of the freight train
showing them the awfulness of the death
they had s<> narrowly and, for most of
them, so cheaply escaped.
The passengers of the wrecked sleeper,
who imagined a moment before that they
had crashed through a bridge and were
about to be drowned in the waters of a
river, received a second shock hefore they
hardly had time to feel themselves on the
solid earth. The Fire Department of
Newman, with the help of the. oc
cupants of the other coaches of the spe
cial, was busily engaged in stopping the
progress of the flames in the wreck, when
the alarm was passed around that an
"il tank on a fiatcar on another track
within a few feet of the burning locomo
tive was full of coal oil and was likely
to explode at any moment. With one ae
e.ird the scantily clad passengers ran na
far as they could to some place where
iheir lives would be sate, if only for a
moment till they could catch their
breath. Agents and physicians of the
railroad arrived on the scene in a short
time and soon were busy caring for the
passengers until the wrecking train
should arrive. The survivors of the
wrecked coach were taken to the Russ
House at Newman, where physicians
made a hasty examination of their inju
ries, while others assisted the firemen to
cut out from the wreckage the bodies of.
Mrs. Thomas and Miss Harris.

Oakland, another train was made up for

ADVERTISEMENTS.
A more pitiful sight than a mother and
her child, both captives and shackled in a
dungeon, could not well be imagined.
There are thousands of .mothers and their
babes who lie shackled by disease in the
dungeon of death.
Without knowing it. or having the faint-
est comprehension of it, the fault lies with
the mother. Too many women enter upon
the responsibilities of wifchood and moth-
erhood while suffering from weakness and
disease of the delicate and important or-
gans that make wifehood and motherhood
possible. A woman who suffers in this v,\iy
cannot be a capable wife and a competent
mother. Before entering upon the duties
and responsibilities of these positions, she
slr.ould see to it that her health, both gen-
eral and local, is thoroughly restored. Dr.
Pierces Favorite Prescription is the best
of all medicines for this purpose. It acts
directly on the sensitive organs concerned,
making them strong, healthy and vigorous.
It promotes regularity of the functions,
allays irritation and inflammation, heals
ulceration, checks unnatural and exhaust-
ing drains and soothes pain. It tones and
builds up the shattered nerves. It ttirns
the dangers and pains of maternity into
safety and ease. It is a medicine that is
intended for this one purpose only and is
good for no other. Dealers sell it and no
honest dealer will suggest a substitute.
"'Dr. Pierces Favorite Prescription did me so
much good that to-day I am well again and
stronger than I have "been for years." writes
Mrs. Alex. Lockie. of Wise. Isabella Co. Mich.
"I have a baby one year old and as fat and
heaithv as one could wish to see. I took two

Miss May Oliver, who lay by the ride
of Miss Harris, who was killed, sustained
Injuries to her back and a sprained ankle.
She was in the most dangerous part and
sh.- regards her escape as miraculous.
"The first knowledge I had of the acci
dent." said Miss Oliver, "was when I ;viia
awakened from a deep sleep by a f<

I immediately discovered that the lower
part of my body was pinioned down by

AT ARCHANGEL
Ready for the Start to
Polar Regions.
Special Cable to The C^ll and fip New Fork
Herald. Copyrighted, 1839, by James Gor
don Bennett.
ARCHANGEL, Russia, July 10.âUn
wonted animation prevails in Archangel I
on account of the simultaneous presence |
of two Princesâ Grand Puke Vladimir and
the Duke of Abruzzi. Grand Duke Vladi
mir, accompanied by General Vasmount
and Captain Bilaeff, has just opened at
Ekaterininsk a now port, to which great
Importance is attached, for maintaining
the fleet and mobilizable during winter. j
It is also of great commercial importance
as a depot for the hide trade with Siberia.
It is situated at the extreme north of the i
Russian possessions, where by a strange j
freak of nature the gulf stream keeps the i
water open during the winter, while the j
more southern ports remain closed by ice. j
Grand Duke Vladimir arrived at Â£>
o'clock in the morning on the steamer
Nicholas 1. -and had a magnificent recep
tion. The weather was fine. On the Qua!
Duvina were all the high officialsâEngle
hart. the Governor: Prince Gortschakoff,
Vice Governor; Hoevelaken, Mayor; Kril-
Itschevsky, Hilde, Marquis de Beauvo'?',
Comte de Gregueil and the whole of the
consular body, besides a great assemblage.
of -people, including mayors from the ut
termost ends of the province, which is
larger than France and England together.
There were maneuvers in the country
outside of town. The garrison was re

manded with a most martial air. ThÂ» j
troops had meals served to them in camp. i
The other Prince, the Duke of Abruzzi, '
attended service this morning at the
Catholic church to Implore divine protec- i
tion on his expedition to the pole. .The |
Norwegian crew and Italian Alpine i
guides, mostly manly looking figures, |
were present, and created much interest
before facing their rough campaign in j
the polar solitude.". The congregation in

The Duke's ship, the Stella Polare, of
the type of the Norwegian three-master. ',
Is painted brown, and will be ready to ;
sail to-morrow. She carries provisions for ] .
several years and is loaded with cases of ;
cod. fur garments of Eskimo pattern, ; ,
material for balloons, which are intended > i
to lighten the burden of transport, and '
many sleighs.
There are besides 140 Siberian dogs. ; !
which live exclusively on fish. They have ;
been chosen from the best breeding ken- ;
nels in the government of Tobolsk, and
cost OOuO rubles.
One mouse gray dog, which was pre- â 
sented by Dr. Nansen and was born on
board the Fram, is looked upon as a mas- '
cot. The Prince expects to land a part of I
his provisions in three weeks' time at |
Cape Flora, and then to reconnoiter |
northwest to Franz Josef Land, which
has not yet been explored. He hopes to
meet the" "Wellman expedition, which has
been on the Ice without ship for more
than a year, and he will perhaps try to
reach the pole.
The arrangement of the Prince's cabin
is practical. There is no porthole, and on
account of the small space everything is
devoted to science. A contract was made j
in Paris while the Duke was in Rome, !
two years ago, for the manufacture of ;
special instruments of precision in Paris. â¢

has made preparations for ascending the j

Edwin D. Luckey, who was on the in

MONACO REFUSES TO
FIGHT COSTELLANE
The PriQce Declares That Aqqo
Gould's Husband Is a Bogus
Count.
NEW YORK, July 10â A Journal rable from Paris says: The Prince
of Monaco has declined to fight a duel with Count Bonl de Oastellane on
account of the Dreyfus case. In his reply to Castellane's challenge, the
Prince of Monaco openly gives as his reason for the declination the fact
that Castellane Is beneath his station. He says that he has reason to
believe that Castellane has assumed the title of Count when he is not
entitled to it. Monaco says that under the circumstances the challenge
from Castellane is an Impertinence, and is not entitled to notice.
The challenge grew out of the active sympathy for Dreyfus and Mm**.
Dreyfus on the part of the Prince of Monaco, which greatly incensed
Castellane. After Monaco had writfpn Mme. Dreyfus and invited her
husband to visit his palace, the royalist husband of Anna Gould openly
insulted the Prince.
The Sleeks one of the leading Dreyfus organs, has taken the matter
up, and is conducting a severe personal campaign against the Count,
whom it accuses of being a bogus count. It has announced its intention
of soon publishing a biography of Jay Gould, the father of the Countess.
ROYALISTS MIXED UP
IN THE DREYFUS CASE.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York Herald. Copy
right, 1899, by James Gordon Bennett.
PARIS. July 10.â M. Andre Buffet, a representative of the Due d'Or
leans' political bureau, was interviewed by the Figaro in regard to the report
which the prefect of police presented to the Government on the Orleanist
party, and which La Gazette de France, the Royalist organ, published yes
terday. The report says the League of ' Patriots and Anti-Semite League
were in communication with the Duke of Orleans, who, it is said, sent 5000
francs to M. Deroulede, and other large sums to Jules Guerin. Altogether
the Royalist party is said to have spent 300,000 francs in organizing the at
tempt at a coup d'etat at the military barracks. M. Buffet says: "The best
thing we could do in reply to recent reports of the plot was to show up
what our adversaries are. We therefore published the principal document of
the prosecution with which we were threatenedâ a report of the prefect of
police â and now let them prosecute us."
In regard to the truth or otherwise of the report, M. Buffet refused to
reply to many statements made. However, he declared them inexact; for
instance, those regarding money alleged to have been given to MM. De
roulede and Guerin. M. Buffet further denied that he was the representa
tive in France of the Due d'Orleans. M. de Haussonville was the repre
sentative of the Oomte de Paris. He resigned on 'the death of that Prince,
and since then the Due d'Orleans desired no further representatives.
M. Buffet is the representative of his political bureau. His royal high
ness wishes to have supreme control of his party and employs various per
sons according to their aptitude.
As to the authenticity of the report on that point there is no doubt. La
Gazette de France obtained it by perfectly legal mean?. It formed part of
the dossier in the recent persecution of the Jeunesse Royaliste. As to the
society, "Sapher Royal," M. Buffet declared that until he road its name in
M. Blanc's report he had never heard the name. As for the "Alouette Gau
loise." it is a Royalist group at La Villette, and as to the existence of
which no mystery was ever made. "Gamelle" is probably a Royalist meet
ing held at Durand's restaurant under the name of Poule au Pot. Another
Vrror in the report is regarding M. de Plas, the administrator of the Ga
zette de France. Everybody knows M. Janicot is the sole proprietor and di
rector of that journal. Everybody knows, too, that the Due d'Andiffret-
Pasquier gave his resignation to the Comte de Paris long before M. Du
fenille, who gave his to the Due d'Orleans.
"You can think what you like." added M. Buffet. "It would really be a
pity to reply to the ensemble of the report and then prosecute us, and we
will reply. For the moment I know nothing."
It is rumored that as a result of the revelation of the Inhuman cruelty
practiced upon Dreyfus while on Devils Island, M. le Bon, the Minister who
was responsible for the orders sent to M. Deniel, while in charge of the
penal settlement where Dreyfus was confined, will be proceeded against,
the Government not confining its action to yesterday's dismissal of M. De
niel. M. Bertillon, the handwriting expert who testified before the <'ourt of
Cassation that Dreyfus was the author of the bordereau, still remains at the
head of the anthroi.ometric department of the Prefecture or Police, but has
boen deprived of his official duties.
Baron Baulny, another of the aristocratic promoters of the demonstra
tion against President Loubet at Auteuil, has been pardoned. It is under
stood that M. Loubet also desired to pardon Baron Christiana, who made
the assault upon him, but the Cabinet decided that this was quite out of the
question.

INTENSE EXCITEMENT
AMONG WE DELEGATES
Teachers at Lrs Anje/es Anxous
About Friends on the
' Wrecked Tram.
LOS ANGELES, July 10.â When the
news was received to-day that a wreck
had occurred on the Southern Pacific, and
that Bfcveral teachers have been killed and
wounded, there was intense excitement
amon? the visiting delegates. Many had
friends on the train, and they besieged
the general headquarters of the National
Educational Association for particulars
of the wreck and the names of the dead
and injured.
Report* at first were grossly exagger
ated jss to the extent of the accident, and
when it was learned that the fatalities
were L'mited the excitement subsided, but
the news, nevertheless, cast a gloom over
the visitors. Ther^ were many expresions
of lndigration at such an aparently inex
cusable accident, and it seems probable,
that action may be taken by the National
Association or the board of directors of
that body.
Secretary Irvin Shepard. when asked
about the matter to-night, said: "The
board or directors of the National Edu
cational Association meets to-morrow
morning at 10 o'clock. The directors may
then take some step in the matter, but I
am lot now prepared to say what, and
would dislike to make any statement in
anticipation of their possible action."
Dr. C. L. Howard of the Columbia
School, St. Louis, spoke this evening in
eulogistic terms of Miss Addie Harris,
one of the ladies killed in the collision at
N<wman this morning. The deceased was
about 30 yeara of age and was second as
sistant at the Madison School, St. Louis.
Edwin D. Luckey, who was one of i.ie
Injured, was the principal of the Ellerds
ville School, St. Louis, and was in charge
of the party.
LAST LETTERS SENT
BY COUNTESS HASSALL
Tell a Pitiful Story of a Proud
Woman's Struggle to Obtain
a Living.
STOCKTON, July 10.â The last letters
written by Lillian (Countess) Hassall, the
aristocratic English woman who shot her
friend. Mr?. Will Ilickman. and herself
on May 1, disclose a life filled with sad
romance. Mrs. Hassall was seen to mail
some letters a few hours before the trag
edy. Until to-day all efforts on the part
of those interested to locate the recipients
failed. One of these letters went to Mips
Edith Cox. who received it in Oakland nt
2 o'clock the following day. It was this
young woman to whom she left the rem
nants of her once magnificent wardrobe.
Across the first page of the letter is
written. "Silence if golden." The writer
reminds her friend that she had promised
to let her know if anything unusual took
place, and says:
"I am determined to end this wretched
struggle for existence."
It recites her disappointment at some
length. Portions of the letter were with
held, but the recipient's comments there
on are sufficient to Justify the presump
tion that Mrs. Hassall wrote the letters
I just before the tragedy, and consequently
it follows that when the two women went
I to their room both had determined to end
their lives.
Miss Cox has a series of letters telling
j of a proud woman's struggle- with hunger
j and privation. On February 2 "the Count
ess" thanked her for the loan of |3. and
i toid how she had been selling her silver
ware to buy food. March 15 she declared,
"Thank God, I have work at last. Only
$3 a week, but enough to buy food."
The letters indicate that Mrs. Hassall's
character was altogether different from
j that pictured at th* time of the double
murder.
REVIEWING THE CASE
OF CAPTAIN CARTER
Mr. McKinley Said to Have Asked
the Attorney General for an
Early Report.
NEW YORK, July 10.â The Sun's special
from Washington says: The case of
Captain O. M. Carter of the Engineer
Corps of the army, convicted by court
martial of irregularities in his accounts,
probably will be finally decided within a
few weeks. The papers are in the hands
of Attorney General Griggs, who has been
reviewing the case by direction of the
President. The Attorney General has
given much time to the findings of the
court and the evidence submitted. He
has personally examined every phase of
the case. To give him complete data all
the acounts of Captain Carter were sent
to the Department of Justice.
Briefs have been filed both for and
against Captain Carter, but to give him
self a complete understanding of the case
Attorney General Griggs has had an ex
pert bank examiner go over all of Captain
Carter's accounts and make a report. He
has consumed much time, as the papers
till two boxes about five feet high and
four feet square. Attorney General Griggs
has nearly completed his review, however,
and is now engaged in summing up state
ments of counsel and the reply of Colonel
Barr.
The World's Washington special says:
It is said to-night that President McKin
ley has at last shown a disposition to take
action in the case of Captain Carter, con
victed by court-martial of embezzling
$1,R00.000 of Government funds while su
perintending harbor work in Georgia.
President McKinley instructed Attorney
General Griggs to hasten his review of the
case and report not later than the last of
this week, that the President may an
nounce by that time his final determina
tion. The Attorney General to-day had
a Government bank official from New
York here giving a comparison of Captain
Carter's private bank account with his
official account.
Governor Roosevelt's recent visit to the
White House is considered by some to be
the chief cause of the President's deci
sion to take up the case in earnest. It is
said that th*Â» Governor told the President
frankly that his dilatoriness was bitterly
resented by the people

\V II Leo. C. I). Johnson. T. P. Iveegan,
P. A- Brush and Charles F. Roher. About
130 carriages, provided by the citizens of
Santa Rosa and the adjoining county,
were in waiting at the depot. The dele
gates separated into different parties and
for two hours were driven to the many
points of int. rest about the town. The
Grosse olive orchards and Rincon Heights
were visited. From the latter the visitors
were afforded an excellent view of the
Santa Rosa and Rincon valleys. The
Fountain Grove vineyards were inspected
and many enjoyed the beauties of the
famous Walnut avenue drive.
To the members of the section on bot
any and horticulture the private experi
mental grounds of Luther Burbank, the
California wizard of horticulture, who has
a world-wide reputation, proved of the
greatest interest. After the drive the

D N. Carithers. Mrs. B. Hendrickson.
Mrs P Coldin, Mrs. A. (l. Burntette and
Mrs E. H. Light, who were assisted by
a number of charming young girls. There
was one unanimous sentiment expressed
by the delegates, and it is best told in the
concise words of Charles S. Murkland,
president of the New Hampshire College,
who said:
"We have read and heard of California,
hut we are only beginning to know her
limitless resources. Here are the future
homes of thousands when the State's
great and varied wealth is known. Who
is to blame that the true resources of
California have not been told as they

the upper course of the stream the de- â

people of that county the Governor was j
unable to comply with the appeal for j
further aid. The negroes of Robinson and <
counties of that section where the flood
subsided nnd that their little homes were i
completely devastated by the flood, and in |
many Instances the tour of the val- i
lev has: been so changed by the raging
waters as to completely obliterate planta
tion boundaries and sites of former resi- .
dences and plantation buildings. Many ot
the negroes refuse to return to the bot
toms. They are afraid another flood will
come t'.nd sweep them to destruction.
Governor Sayers to-day completed his
work of organizing the State into dis- i
tricts of from six to eight counties each j
for the purpose of securing systematic
co-operation In the work of raising sup- j
piles for the aid of the sufferers. A re- :
ceivlng and distributing agent for each
district was appointed, it is expected that ;
this method will result in fully 200 car- i
loads of food supplies and clothing being
raispd and shipped 10 the destitute people
wihin the next three days. Each county
in the State is expected to contribute not
le;-.s than one car of necessities. The rail
roads are hauime the supplies free of
freigm charges.
1 ne work of rescuing waterbound peo- I
I>!e in Fort Bend and Brazorta counties
â was carried on on an extensive scale to- j
day. Several hundred boats, including a \
number of Government craft, sent from
Galveston and Velasco; plied the turbu- I
lent waters all day, and several hundred
negro families and a few whites were j
taken from ireetops and little knolls of
high ground and conveyed to regions
where they were provided with food and
shelter.
Among the larger cash contributions re
ceived oy Governor Sayers to-day to be
expended in behalf of the refugees was
JKn.lO from the Western manager of the
Waters Spice Oil Company of St. Louis.
Relief commit tees have been organized In
nearly every city and town in the State,
and wonderful generosity is being shown
by the people in contributing money, food,
supplies and clothing for t lie needy. A
proprietary me licine company of St. Louis
wired the Governor to-day asking if help
â¢was nee,'...: from persons outside of Texas
for the sufferer.-:. The Governor replied
that all such contributions would be ac
ceptable. Among the telegrams received
by the Governor to-day regarding the
situation in the flooded regions was the
following from John P. Bell, county
Judge of Austin County:
"There are 1200 flood sufferers in this
county north of Mill Creek, 1000 south of
Mill Creek, including Wards Bend, and
3.'W at Wallis. The people of â  llvllle have
cared for those north of Mill Creek up to
Saturday without aid from any other
source. Sealey and San Kilipi have re
ceived from you $500 and 1600 rations.
Wallis received 1000 rations. Bellville,
with her 1200 people, has received no aid
vet, but bought $500 worth of meat and
bacon, expecting to pay for it out of the
$1000 to be received from you. Wallis will
be in need of food again to-morrow."
The Governor received the following
telegram from Lewis R. Bryan and others
of Velasco, at the mouth of the Brazos,
in Brazoria:
"The water has reached its highest
point, and Vela&>to is all right and able
to take care of such of her people as may
Meed assistance. The channel is deep and
we wish your aid In getting Government
engineers to let the contract for work
on the jetties at the very earliest moment,
as it serves the trustees the double pur
pose of saving much dredging, and will
also give work to many people and have -i
good moral effect on the people of this
and adjoining coui.ties by helping to re- j
vive and steady their hopes and spirits in
this time of destruction and demoraliza
tion."
S. Tallffero, chairman of the Houston
relief committee, wired Governor Savers I
as follows:
"Please wire the Mayors of towns
named below, asking the immediate do
nation of cotton seed for replenishing In
flooded districts. Must be immediate to
be successful: Brenham, Austin. Hous
ton Waco, San Antonio, Temple, Bellton,
Bryan Corsicana, Waxahachle, Dallas,
Hiflsboro, Brownwood Palestine, Groves
ton, Groesbeck. Ennis, Wortham, Sher
man, Paris, irkana, Denison, Flatonia,
Luling, Hallettsville and Weimar. In ad
dition to cotton seed the flood sufferers
need black-eyed peas and sorghum seed
and Kaffir or other quick maturing corn
to plant as soon as the flood recedes."
The Governor complied with the request.
W. E. Hunnlcutt wired the Governor th.it
the flood sufferers of Falls County are
being cared for by the local aid commit
tee. Colonel Ike Btanifer of Sherman
â¢wired that he had organized all the towns
in Grayson County and the work of gath
ering contributions has commenced. Swift
,v Co. of Kansas City wired that they will
contribute 5000 pounds of bacon for the
sufferers. The half -famished refugees at
Bunnyside, in Waller County, were partly
relieved of their hunger to-. lay. A tele
gram was received from R. K. Hanna of
Hempstead stating that a consignment cf
food supplies was sent from that place to
Sunnysfde to-day and that there are about
COO needy people there.
State Health Officer "W. F. Blunt has
gone to the flooded region to investigate
th* health and sanitary conditions.
In response to an inquiry as to whether
outside assistance is needed for the des
titute people Governor Sayers replied this
evening:
' "Texas is not asking help, but will
greatly appreciate any assistance ren
dered." _, Â .
The distress in the Brazos Valley if very
prrpat, indeed. The average length of the
flood Is 300 miles, and Is fully ten miles
wide, sweeping everything before It A
telegram was received from J. W. Fel.cer

Grimes County; stating that help Is
needed to feed 500 people there.

LOS AXOET.ES, July 10.â The full
force of the honor of being a
convention city was felt to-day
by the citizens of Los Angeles.
There are now upward of 9000
teachers and their friends added to the
population, the influx of to-day being
estimated at 1500. At a late hour to
night the committee on reception and
hotels received bulletins that to-mor
row eighteen trains would arrive and
on Wednesday as many more would
unload their burdens of kodak-laden
and badge-bespangled schoolma'ams.
The wisdom of those persons that
insisted upon making extensive ar
rangements for accommodating a
large crowd of National Educational
Association delegates and visitors was
tested to-day. The facilities, great as
they were last week supposed to be,
did not exceed the actual need. The
general headquarters was packed
with people during the morning hours.
The departments for stamping tickets,
enrolling members and assigning
rooms were rushed with business and
some difficulty was experienced in
keeping the crowd moving. The large
exposition room was thronged and but
a small proportion of the crowd could
get at th*> big registry book. The of
ficers of the National Educational As
sociation were gratified over the con
firmation of the prediction they had
made.
However great the crush, the ar
rangements are so complete that not a
murmur of discontent has been heard.
The limit of rooms has not been
reached, as there is an emergency list
of 1000 rooms, provided by leading citi
zens, that so far has not been called
Into requisition.
The delegates to-day had their first
experience with true Californian hospi
tality. The entertainment committee
set apart to-day as Los Angeles day.
The parlors of a leading hotel had been
thrown into one and been profusely
decorated with a wealth at bloom and
potted palms. Forty local women
teachers acted as hostesses and
dispensed a rare punch, thai combined
the aroma of a dozen varieties of
fruits.

stantaneous flash, over 10,000 incandes- |
cent and 500 arc lights twinkled wel
come to the multitudes that lined the
principal streets. And thes were in ad
dition to the ordinary city lights and
the efforts of the merchants, who have
in very many instances lighted up their
premises with lights in variegated i
colors. The park, upon which the pa- I
vilion faces, and wherein the general j
sessions of the convention will be held,
was made as bright as day. and a band
entertained the throng that filled every j
avenue.
The orange orchard at Tropico will
be thrown 'open to the delegates to
morrow. This orchard has been en
gaged for the pleasure the teachers may
enjoy in personally picking the fruit
and observing citrus growth and cul
ture. Another object lesson is provided
in a trip made to-night, and to be re
peated to-morrow night, to Mount
Lowe, above the clouds, over the rail
road recently purchased by Valentine
Peyton of Danville, 111. The great
searchlight scanned the valley and the
party of delegates was photographed in
its rays. Professor Swift, at the obser
vatory, lectured upon Saturn and her i
rings, and. with the aid of the tele
scope, afforded sn opportunity for the ;
study of astronomy.
The meetings of the National Council ;
of Education were continued to-day. !
The first morning session was taken i
up by the report of the special commit- j
tee of the department of superinten- ;
dence on school hygiene. The report i
was made by Hon. W. H. Harris,
United States Commissioner of Educa- i
tion, Washington, D. C. A discussion
followed the reading of the report, with j
the result that a committee was ap
pointed to present to the board of di
rectors a request from the superinten- j
dents of the different departments ask
ing that the former recommend an ap
propriation of $1200, to be used as pre
miums for prize essays on "School Hy- j
giene," and for the purpose of defray
ing the expenses of further investiga
tion along the line of proper school- i
room ventilation. The committee ap- \
pointed Is as follows: Professor A. R. j
Taylor of Emporia, Kans., the presi
dent of the National Council; Dr. Har
ris of Washington, D. C. ; Dr. George P. â¢

and Dr. Aaron of Colorado.

MEETING OF TEACHERS
principal of the High School at Holy
oke, Mass., on the differentiation of the
American school. Havi t indicated
what differentiation has obtained in !
practice, and hinted at the Justification
for each type of school Professor Keyes
proceeded to draw a few warrantable
conclusions. Said he:
The existence of so many courses is due
to the conviction that there Is no warrant |
for the assumption that either the same \
order or some combination of studies is i
the best means to the highest self-realiza- i
tinn for all pupils. Judged by the com- I
pleteness with which they help those who j
receive their training to make the most of
themselves, these courses may be said
to Btand on nearly or quite equal foot
ing. As preparation for life's work, the
course of a good Latin school, that of an
English high school or that of a scientific I
school seem equally efficient and equally
deficient. The power one gets from his- j
tory and science another gleans from clas- ]
si( s and mathematics, and so on. The
failure that one makes of Latin another |
makes of mathematics, and still a third
of history. The reasonable deduction is j
not simply election of courses but election
of subjects.
Must not the ideal high school cease to
nr< scribe any but the essential tool of
ss? If Its business is to give the pu
pil four years of opportunity "to make the
it" i of himself." in a high sense of the
expression, must it not content itself with
Insisting that he shall do four full years

The report of the committee on State
Normal schools presented by Professor
Z. X. Snyder, preÃident of the State
Normal School at Greeley, Colo., dealt
with the function of the normal school
in relation to the faculty; those pre
paring to teach, the child, the social
mind or society and the subjects to be i
studied. Valuable statistics were em- !
bodied in the report, the data on the!
several subjects dealt with represent- ]
Ing the labor of all the members of the j
committee. In concluding Professor
Snyder said:
'J he preparation of teachers for the ele
ry schools has everywhere been re
garded "as the special function of the State
Normal Schools, although where the
means were at hand very excellent work
â¢ een lone In the preparation of teach- :
e-rs for high schools and academies. Some
have made provision for a general
system of normal schools: others have;
centered their efforts upon one large insti
tution. The latter plan has made it easier j
â¢A a satisfactory standard of admls- j
sion, but from the nature of the case it
has faihil to BUpply teachers in sufficient
numbers for ;ill the rural schools. The
States with v system of normal schools
have thus far not succeeded in furnishing
:m edequate supply of teachers trained
at normal schools. Now York has pone
farthest in the direction of requiring can
didates to avail themselves of profession
al training.
Professor L. D. Harvey, State Super
intendent of Public Instruction, Madi
son, Wis., read a pap*r on the subject,
"Do We Need a University Trust?" in
which he summed up the problems of
fering for solution:
1. How to secure to the people of the
respective States the highest grade of in
structional work possible in the regular
collegiate courses, and at the same time
t<> convince the people generally that this
is the lirst duty of the university.
2. To organize those deportments of grad
uate work fnr which there is the greatest
demand, not from the professors', but
from graduates from the collegiate
< ourses, to the extent to which the funds
available will warrant, after provision is
made for carrying on the undergraduate
work at the highest degree of efficiency.
3. To limit tiie number of lines of grad
uate work offered so as to make it possi
ble to offer facilities for doing whatever
work is attempted as well as It can be
done anywhere without increasing the de
mands for appropriations so as to weaken
the support of the people through their
I representatives in the Legislature.
At the evening session. Dr. E. C.

THEIR MISSION
THE UPLIFTING
OF THE INDIAN
Second Annual Institute of the
Teachers Who Labor for
Poor Lo.
LOS ANGELES, July 10.â second I
annual convention of the Indian j
Teachers' Institute, that to-day met
in session in this city, marks a new
epoch in the Indian service and from it
will date a radical departure from former
custom, In the holding of yearly gather-
Ings of those who art: consecrating their
lives and ambitions to the upbuilding of
the Indian race.
These Indian Teachers' Institutes are
the outgrowth of the energy and execu
tive force of Miss Estelle Reel, the hrst
woman to hold the office of National Su
perintendent of Indian Schools. In dis
charging the duties of her office Dy in
specting the Indian schools in Kansas,
Oklahoma, Arizona, New Mexico. Wash
ington. Oregon and California during l v ;Â»7.
Miss Reel became familiar with the needs
of the Indian and as a sequence endeav
ored to bring about a broadening of the
minds that directed the educational
branch of the Indian service. Having this
in mind. Miss Heel recommended that an
institute for Indian teachers be held
where, emulating the practice of the
teachers of colleges and normal and pub
lic schools, these Government teachers
could meet, become personally acquaint
ed, exchange ideas and offer suggestions
that would prove beneficial in their voca
tion. The convention last year was held
in Colorado Springs, Col., and demon
strated the wisdom of establishing thes^
institutes.
To further aid the teachers in the In
dian service Miss Reel suggested to the
department that the institute for ISÂ»'J bd
held in Los Angeles at the time of the
National Educational Association conven
tion. The central idea that governed this
impulse was embodied in Miss Reel a
language: "We believe that every teacher
can learn, and 1 think that when the
teachers who come from every section of j
the United States meet In session it will
be possible for the teachers employed In
the Indian service to be able to study
method, by hearing eminent scholars dis
cuss pedagogic questions. The Influence
is for the better, and our teachers will be
made stronger and become Imbued with
a higher conception of their calling.
Hence the Indian Teachers' Institute will
this year become, during the daily ser
vices Of the National Educational Asso
ciation, a part of that natioual body for
instruction, advancement and improve
ment."
The second annual session of the In
dian Teachers' Institute was this morn-
Ing called to order at 10 o'clock by Miss
Reel, who introduced the Hon. Thomas J.
Kirk, State Superintendent of Public In
struction. Professor Kirk delivered an
address of welcome on behalf of the
State. Hon. Fred Eaton, Mayor of Los
Angeles, welcomed the teachers on behalf
of the municipality, while Dr. George W.
White, president of the University
of Southern California; Dr. E. T.
Pierce, principal of the Normal School,
and Professor J. Forhoy, Superintend
ent of the public schools of Los An
geles, welcomed the delegates on behalf
of the school Interests of the city, county
and State, the welcoming addresses con
cluding with, an address by Dr. Irvin
Shepard, general secretary of the Na
tional Educational Association, who wel
comed them on behalf of the teachers of
the nation, and bade them a hearty wel
come to the National Educational Asso
ciation convention. â :â â â > -â¢ -.
The responses were made in a happy
vein, and when Hon. A. C. Tanner. As
sistant Commissioner of Indian Affairs of
Washington, D. C. replied, he did so on j
behalf of the Government, and expressed â¢
gratification that the teachers in the di
rect employ of the nation should be wel
comed to the Golden State with a hos
pitality that was characteristic, distinc
tive and pronounced.
Major R. H. Pratt. Superintendent of
the Carlisle (Pa.) Indian School, spoke in
behalf of the Eastern schools, and S. M.
McCowan in behalf of the Western In
dian schools.
The musical programme reflected great |
credit upon Miss Gertrude Carpenter, su- i
perintendent of music of the San Francis
co public schools, who had it in charge.
The band from the Indian school at Per
ris, and also the girls' mandolin club from
the. same school, won credit for the sev
eral selections rendered. Several of the
boys have recently been selected to form
part of the band the Government pur
poses sending to the Paris Exposition. .

MISS ESTELLE REEL.
Woman Educator Who May Become
Wyoming's Governor.
Miss Etetelle Reel of Wyoming, who wa3
appointed Supe rintendent of Indian Schools
by President McKlnley, has a personality
and a career well calculated to give joy
to the man- or woman who is hopeful for
the future of the gentler sex. Miss Reel
is the kind of woman voter and woman
reformer to which the equal suffragist of
either sex delights to point. Pretty, gen
tle, educated, broad-minded, progressive,
she is possessed of a healthy egotism that
stands up for its own rights, while it is
never forgotful of the rights of others.
The new Indian School Superintendent is
first of all amply able to fill this Impor
tant government post.
It must be remembered that woman suf
frage is no bizarre idea in the upland
country of Wyoming, where the breezes
blow fresh and the men are more honest
than they are in the Eastern cities and at
low elevations. In Wyoming a woman is
regarded as capable of being as sensible,
as wise :m<l as learned as a man. The
idea of woman's equality may be said to
be organic there. That is why Miss Reel
is si widely admired and why she has so
much Influence.
That fact, too, explains why the people
Of Wyoming have seriously considered
Miss Keel for their Governor. Two years
ago she had a grand boom for the nomin
ation for Governor of Wyoming. That is
t" say, her friends then laid plans for her
nomination during the approaching fall.
Ir 1896 Miss Reel was ineligible for the
position of Governor of Wyoming. The
Governor must be at leasi 30, and at that
tim.- Miss Heel was only L'P. Sh>' has now
the age qualification and her friend.s be
lieve she has all the other qualifications
as well. But Miss Reel herself takes a
sensible view of the mutter. She disclaims
the ability to manage the affairs of a
State as well as the best man that Wyom
ing can find. She says that she does not
desire to be Governor. According to her.
the women of Wyoming (who poll half the
vote of the State, by the way) will be
satisfied with one of the six State offices
fi Â«r some time to come. This Is the office
of State Superintendent of Public In
struction.
Miss Reel prepared herself for the pro
f. ~sicn of an educator in the schools of
Chicago, St. Louis and Boston. She did
no little work in that line in Chicago be
fore coming West to grow up with the
country. She began her career in Chey
enne Â»k a teacher In one of the public
schools there, and her talent brought her
rapidly to the top. She was promoted
first to be the Superintendent of Instru â¢
tion for Laraxnie County â the most im
portant under-position of its kind in the
State. For foui years she filled that posi
tion admirably. Then she was made Stata
Superintendent, and now she is given the
highly Important post of Superintendent
of Indian Schools.
In her capacity as Superintendent of fr>
stri:eti< n fÂ«>r Wyoming Miss Reel has hell
the r.x tiflÃciO position of secretary of tne
Ht.tti> Board Of Charities. The duties of
th ; s board ait to conserve the State chir
[tnble and penal institutions. She has also
served ex-ofÃcic as secretary of the State
Land Board, which has charge of the
grants of land made to the State by Con
gress. Miss Reel has been very active :n
the matter of this land, and has fathere'l
several plans for its utilization. As sem
inary and register of the board she har
distributed several hundreds of thousinds
of dollars, received ns rent from public
lands, among the charitable and educa
tional ins-Miutlons of the State. When she
became register the office was paying into
the State treasury about $100 per Veek;
In the course of a year or two she had
brought the returns up to $1000 per week.

Judging by her past work Miss Reel will
accomplish much good in her new and
trying Jield.
Such has been the public life of the
new Indian School Superintendent. It is
a certainty that these Institutions will
profit by contact with her active mind
find her large sense of duty. She will
shake things about wherever she goes,
and if there Is anything wrong with the
Indian schools she will seek out the cause
and never rest until the evil shall have
been remedied.
Miss Reel believes the Tndians capable
of great development. The Government
is doing great things for them in the 500
scl Is sÂ«-t apart for their use. Of tlr>
E 100 Indians in th^ United States oO.oO.)
are of school age. What is needed most
is manual training, nn>l it is needed in
every grade of the schools. Miss Reel is
now introducing this feature of work. In
talking of Indian schools Miss Reel said:
â¢â¢The Carlisle school In Pennsylvania and
the Haskell school in Kansas are the best
known Indian institutions. Their grad
uates make good m<-n and women, and
they do not return to the blanket after
being graduated, as has been said. There
may be a few sucb cases, but statistics
show that 78 per cent of the graduates
make good use of their knowledge."

OFFICERS OUSTED
Decision Against Sheriff [
and Commissioners.
JUDGE STEWART'S RULING
HOLDS THAT THE CHARGES
HAVE BEEN PROVED.
; Close Guard Kept Upon the Jurors
Now Trying the Case of Paul
Corcoran on a Charge of
Murder.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WALLACE, Idaho, July 10.â Judge Stew- j
I art this morning- rendered his opinion In ;
' the actions brought by the Attorney- Gen- ;
â  eral for the removal of the County Com- ;
: nilssioners and Sheriff. He held that the i
charges had been proved to his sausfac
tion, and ordered their removal from of
fice. There were a number of charges
against the Commissioners, the chief
anmng: which was that of approving the
official bond of the Sheriff and that of the
Tax Collector in a sum less than that pro
vided by law. A few of the sureties on '
these bonds did not appear upon the as
sessment roll, and some had allowed their '
; taxes to become delinquent. In each case ;
legally qualified sureties were upon the
loads for more than the amount required
by law, but the court held that the suro
tlea must qualify In double the amount.
required, and that therefore the Commis-
B had not performed their duty in
accepting the bonds. There were several
other charges but they were of a trivial .
nature.
Judge Stewart rendered a lengthy opin
lon, i ov< ring eighteen pages of type-writ
ten matter. In the case against the Sheriff
. the charge was failure to prevent the. riot
' uf April 29 and refusing to Identify par
ticipants therein. The Sheriff has main
tained that he was unable to recognise
any one in the mob, but the court thought
otherwise and ordered his removal from
otnee for failure to perform his duty.
The Commissioners have been allowed
the, llbertj of the town for several days,
but the Sheriff has been confined in the
Wallace jail, and is still kept there. An
appeal will be taken to the Supreme- Court
of the State.
Governor Steunenberg has been here for
several days and will at once appoint
Commissioners to till the places declared
vacant by the court. The Commissioners,
under the Idaho law, will appoint a Sher- :
Iff.
The trial of Paul Corcoran began in
earnest this afttrnoon. Acting Prosecut
ing Attorney Forney made his opening
statement to the jury before luncl
outlined the ca- State. He stated â¢
| that the prosecution would prove a con- |
Bpiracy on the part of the members of '
the union, acting as such organisation, .
to destroy the Bunker Hill mill and i\r { .\â
out of the country all non-union men em
: ployed by the â¢ â¢â  that in pur
e of this conspiracy puna and masks
were placed In the vi lon halls In Burke,
Gem and Mullan; that on the morning
of the "lUh the union miners at Burke
repaired to their hall, where they armed
and masked and marched to the depot,
where they captured the train which took
them to Wardner; that they were met
at Gem and Wallace by delegations from
i the other unions and at Wardner by
. members of that union. Forney premised â 
' to show that the defendant was a raov
ing spirit in this conspiracy, and that he
! was one of the men who shot at Chi
for whose murder he 1b now being tried.
In the afternoon but two witnesses
wore examined, one of whom. Sheriff
, Young, refused a number of times to i
: testify on the ground that he was In the
custody of the military authorities and
I did no"t know what charge might be
1 placed against him, and that his answer
might incriminate him. He only answ< .-â  d
questions on being ordered so to do by
the court.
The other witness. Thomas Ames,
prover rather favorable to the defense,
stifled that he was a member of the
â  Wardner Miners' Union, and that h<
be< n told by certain members >>f the
union to keep away from the train on ;
the day of the riot because he cou
â  : account of a muti
lated hand.
On cross-examination he said that the
Instructions of the officers of the union
! were never to destroy property or molest
i any one and that he knew nothing of any
contemplated riot, and did not believe
â  any member of the Wardner union knew
i of'it. Witness did not go to the scene
i of the disturbance and had no personal
I knowledge. He also testified that he had
been discharged by the Bunker Hill Com
' pany because he was a union miner.
Bedfl have been placed in a hall adjoin
ing the courtroom for the jury, who are
i not allowed to receive papers or letters |
i or speak to any one without permission j
from the court. The trial cannot be
finished short of ten days.

The United States Local Inspectors
at New York Refuse to Accept

Him for Two Years.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, July 10.â The report of
Captain Watkins of the stranding of the
American steamship Paris was made pub
lic to-day by the local Board of Steam
boat Inspectors. Captain Watkins makes
no attempt to evade responsibility for th.c
accident, but on the contrary says frank
ly that the stranding of the. ship. was the
result of an unaccountable error on his
part. The accident, he says, was not
due to any want of thought or anxiety
about his vessel, but resulted from a mis
take he made in calculating the position
of the ship.
The local inspectors have suspended
Captain Watkins' license as master of
ocean steamers for two years.
Captain Watkins Is still in charge of the
Paris and is acting in the interests of
the underwriters, to whom the ship was
turned over by the American line offi
cials.
Captain Watkins' report was made un
der oath. After reciting the incidents at
tending the striking of the vessel, the
rescue of the passengers and crew, the
saving of the valuable cargo and the sub
sequent efforts to tloat the steamship, the
captain says:

Captain Watkins makes a statement of
his sea si rvice since 1851, during which

departure from Cape Lra Hogue at 7:38,
when he was actually abreast of the Cas
nuets at that time, a distance of about
sixteen and one-half miles. This of course
would put him sixteen and one-half miles
ahead of his reckoning, but would not ac
count for his In ing set into the northward
of his course seven miles, allowing his in
tention to pass the Lizard at a distance of
three miles. As Captain "\Vatkins does
not make any mention of making allow
ance for tide, we are of the opinion he had
not taken that matter into consideration,
whereas, when he approached the English
coast he must have encountered the flood
tide on his port bow, setting him toward
the land. In addition to this he makes no
mention of having used his lead and he
only discovered it was thick over the land
when the ship was ashore.
"Giving all due consideration to these
matters, we are of the opinion that Cap
tain "Watkins has not acted with the ne
cessary care and attention requisite in the
navigation of his vessel which a master
should have used and we therefore sus
pend his license as master for ocean
steamers for a period of two years."

CONSIDERATION
POSTPONED
Attorney Archibald Barnard of the
Tfr-pubHcan County Central Committee
appeared last evening before the Elec
tion Commission and, speaking for the
committee, nested that considera
tion of its petition for a blanket
ticket be deferred until such ti ...ft as the
entire commission could be present. T.
J. Peridergast, also of the committee.
agreed in this with Mr. Barnard, and
after some little discussion the com
mission consented to postpone it to 11
o'clock to-morrow morning.
In making his lues.t Mr. Barnard
said: "It is the desire of the Central
Committee, for which 1 speak, that
consideration of its petition be deferred
until all of the members of the com
mission are present, but at the same
time we do not want to wait longer
than Wednesday, and i would ask that
that day be set."
Commissioners Lane, Wells and
Sheehan, who were the only members
on hand, consulted a moment, and Lane
announced that Mayor Phelan would
not return from his vacation until Sat
urday, but that- he would set Wednes
day as the day.
"I want to ask Mr. Lane if he is still
of the opinion that our plan is not fea
sible; he so expressed himself to me
the other day," broke in Pendergast.
"I am certainly of the same opinion,"
retorted Lane. "I don't think your
scheme is feasible, and don't think it
will go.".
The commission then took up the se
lection of election officers, and a discus
sion, which gave every promise of be-
Ing heated, was staved off un
til to-morrow.

JEFFRIES WELCOMED HOME.
ENGLAND'S IDEA OF SHAMROCK.
LOS ANGELES
WELCOMES THE
NEW CHAMPION
Jeffries in His Old
Home.
â¢
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS AXGELES. July 10.â It has been
a long time since Los Angeles sports
have had an opportunity to welcome a
champion, and to say that they did not
do it to the highest degree of perfection
to-day would be a misstatement of
facts. James J. Jeffrie?, the champion
heavy-weight of the world, is again in
the city that for eighteen years he has
called "home." The champion arrived
at 2 o'clock, forty minutes later than
was expected. Thousands assisted in
the welcome, and the big, bashful
champion bowed right and left as he
was whirled through the crowded thor
oughfares from the Arcade depot to the
Hollenbeck Hotel.
As the champion stepped from the
rear of the train President John Brink
of the Los Angeles Athletic Club and
Tom Darmody entwined his neck with
a huge wreath of flowers, composed of
the national colors. The blue flowers
were "bachelor buttons," and the red
and white flowers were roses and car
nations. The train that bore the young
boilermaker was filled with teachers,
and the presence of thousand:- uf per
sons that surged around the depot
caused a murmur of comment, but
when the instructors heard the cheers
for Jeffries a college yell and a Vassar
<-ull were mingled with the huzza of the
sports of the older school. Jeffries was
received as a hero. He was escorted up
town in a buggy that was preceded by
the Seventh Regiment band and fol
lowed by a dozen tally-hos. As soon as
he could escape from the crowd, short
ly after 3 o'clock, "Jim," with only one
thought in his. mind, hurried to his
East Los Angeles home to greet the
woman that is more to him than any
thing else in this world â his mother.
"Brother Jack" accompanied "Jim,"
and the meeting between the sons and
the mother was sweetly pathetic.
To-night Jeffries was serenaded and
later driven to the Burbank Theater,
where the champion boxed four rounds,
ar.d then with his brother, '"Jack" Jef
fries," gave an illustration of the tenth
and eleventh rounds of his battle with
Robert Fitzsimmons, including the
knockout blow.

SHAMROCK WINS
One Pound a Week
for Life.
Special Cable to Th? Call and tn* N>w York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1S0&, by James Gor- j
d'.n Bennett.
SOUTHAMPTON. July 10.â Rumor
has it that Sir Thomas Lipton has
promised each of the crew one pound a
week for life if the Shamrock wins.
The sailmakers have to-day been busy ;
on board the Shamrock making many
j trifling alterations to the canvas which
Saturday's spin showed to be neces
i sary.
People are talking and writing a
great deal about the coming trial of
the Shamrock with the Britannia. Now.
let me tell you on the best authority
that Mr. Fife is' not going to allow
these trials to give any indication of
what the Shamrock is capable of doing.
People will know as little after these
i p. '-called trials as before. Independently
j of the care that Mr. Fife will take to
i ward this end, there Is the facfthat the
i Shamrock, as she Is now, is a different
boat from what she will be when she
sails at New York. Now her inside is
stiff' nt-d with steel girders. These will
not be removed until she gets ready
for her races in New York. This change
i will entirely alter her conditions at sta
bility.
The cleverest yachtsmen here â those
closely connected with the Shamrock â
express themselves with the utmost
skepticism regarding the trials between
the Columbia and Defender, holding
that such trials cannot possibly have
been held with the object of making
any real race between the boats. If it
were so, they maintain, it is lack of pol
icy, but they conclude that the trials
have been for negative purposes, such
as those that will be made here in a
few days; in fact, rather as "a blind,"
Anyhow, the next time the Shamrock
&,<â :<' out we shall at least have the
pleasure of making the acquaintance of
her jack-yard, topsail, flying jib, bal
loon foresail and spinnaker, which up
to the present have remained on the
hulk of a schooner lying alongside of
the Sh mrock, upon which her crew
lives. With these set we shall be able
to judge a little better whether she is
as stiff as she appeared on Saturday.
The schooner opon which the crew
lives lies on the port side "of the Sham- -
rock. No one sleeps on board the
yacht, although there is a constant
watch throughout the night. There is
no accommodation aboard the racer.
Here, as well as in New York, the
hands will live away from the cutter.
Here they are dwelling very comfort
ably on ;ir, <>M hulk. In New York they
will be on a sort of house boat, where
they will live without shore liberty un
til the races are over. This all the men
understood, and although they have
not signed their indentures yet, they will
do so, including the conditions named.
most willingly, such is their enthu
siasm.
A nattier crow it would be difficult to
find. All are bright, alert young fel
low?, with mastheadsmen among thorn,
nimble as cats, picked so that they
stay at the masthead throughout an

MOTOR CYCLE CRAZE GROWING.
BASEBALL IN THE EAST.
MOTOR-PACE
FEVER ATTACKS
BICYCLE MEN
Many Want to Follow
Machines.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, July 10. â Cycle racing
men have been attacked by the motor !
pace fever. Just at present its
ravages are confined to. professional
riders, but later it promises to grip <.y
--cle race patrons in even more virulent j
form. Its sudden outbreak is coincident '
with the sudden coining of Miller and;
Linton with their Parisian naphtha
tandems, and of August Cabaillat, the
most expert steersman of motor cycles
in France.
With a suddenness that proves the
force of the fever a score of American ,
professional riders, who have made rep- ;
Utations in other distances, have an- i
nounced their candidacy for the mid- â¢
die-distance paced honors. As many
more riders of scarcely less repute have
as promptly offered their services on !
the motor machines that have already
been negotiated for the promoters
caught with the infection have hurri
edly altered their programmes of the
immediate future,- and one concern, the
Atlantic Athletic Association, an
nounced to-day that a big motor record
race will contribute to the feature at
each of its meets at Manhattan Beach
during the remainder of the season.
A factor in the races will be Linton
and his crack French tandems. His ma
chines differ from those of American
make, and Linton claims that they are
faster. His crew has had experience
in navigating motor cycles, whereas the
American crews will enter the lists
comparatively raw. Cabaillat, the
steersman, is referred to as "The Devil
<>n Wheels" on the tracks of his own ;
country. He will take his machine ]
through to port in a crowd that scarce- j
ly another rider would attempt. He
holds a certificate from the French
authorities attesting his capability t.>
drive racing cars of fifteen-horse power
over the roads of that republic.
With Cabaillat rides Dudley Marks,
whose knowledge of mechanics makes
him a safe engineer. Marks, occupying
a rear seat, is able to coach Linton be
hind him. Cabaillat and Marks assert
that they can drive tandems at the
rate of thirty-six miles an hour. If
Linton is able to follow them at that
,rate he will beat the world's record for
distance, held by Elkes, by nearly two
miles.
Ltnton's tandems differ slightly from
the motor machine brought over from
France by Henri Fournier. The cogs
in that of the latter are replaced by
chains in Linton's machines. Like
Fournier's tandem, Linton's motor cy
cles have two horsepower capacity.
Miller's tandem is exactly the same
as those owned by the Welshman. Both
Miller and Linton were greatly exer- j
cised because they were forced to pay i
a duty of 45 per cent on their motors
when they landed In New York. They
had expected to bring them in on the
same ground as theatrical effects.
TOSSES AWAY THE DECISION.
NEW YORK, July 10.â Matty Matthews
i of Brooklyn defeated Otto Zc-iloff of Chi
cago in the ninth round of a vicious right
at the Coney Island Sporting Club to
i night. Matthews was by far the cleverer
1 and used both hands relentlessly on his
j opponent's anatomy. In the ninth Zeiloff
: staggered helplessly and Matthews
dropped his hands as he said to George
i Edwards, the referee:
"I don't want to hit him any more."
Edwards took the hint and stopped the
bout right there by orderfng the men to
i their corners and declaring Matthews the
â  winner.
Frank Patterson of Brooklyn and Solly
: Smith of Los Angeles fought a twenty
five round draw at 122 pounds. The men
fought savagely, but were strong at the
finish. Patterson was frequently cau
tioned for hitting low and was disquali
! fled in the twenty-third round for repeat-
Ing the offense. Smith begged the referee
to lot the bout go on and so lost, a favor
-1 able doclelon. The attendance was 6000.
MYSTERY OF A
PHYSICIAN'S
SUDDEN DEATH
Dr. Schlarbaum Dies
in a Lodging-House.
USED A FICTITIOUS NAME
DEADLY POISONS FOUND IN
THE ROOM HE OCCUPIED.
Deceased Had Been Suffering From
Asthma for Many Years, Which
May Have Ended His
Life.
Dr. John Christian Benedictine Schlar
baum, a physician prominent in lodge
| circles of this city and Oakland, was
'â  found dead in a lodging-house at 119 Third
street yesterday afternoon. There Is somo
doubt as to the cause of his death, ami
the Coroner has ordered an investigation.
The presence of deadly poisons In the
room would Indicate suicide, but the. fact
I that the man had been suffering from
asthma for many years strengthens the ,
belief that he succumbed to the disease.
On Sunday evening Dr. Schlarbaum
registered under a fictitious name at the
hotel and apked for a room in the upper
portion of the building.- He said that he
had been suffering from asthma and was
in a very bad condition. He went to bed.
but did not appear next day. and at 3
o'clock his room was entered by the clerk,
who found him sitting in a chair, dear!.
i From all appearances he had been vomit-
I Ing and had been In a distressed condition.
When the t'oroner arrived he found a
bottle of cyanide of potassium and one of
muriatic acid concealed in a bureau
drawer in the room. They were about the
only property belonging to the deceased
â  which could ho found. Investigation
i proved that instead of being J. B. (illes.
| as whs on the register, the body was that
of Dr. Schlarbaum. This was ascertained
J. C. B. SCHLARBAUM.
from the name on a number of lodge
receipts found in his pockets and from
the initials on his shirt front.
Among the other papers were several
prescriptions for morphine tablets filled
at a local pharmacy. Inquiry at the drug
store corroborated the statement that
the doctor had been suffering some time
from asthma.
Dr. Schlarbaum graduated from the Cal
ifornia Medical College in this city on
December 12, 1888. He practiced medicine
for some years and had an office m the
Nevada block. Recently he abandoned
his profession on account of his health and
took up mining. A few days ago he re
turned from San Jose, having been to the
Interior portions of the State on prospect
ing trips. The presence of the poisons in
the room can be accounted for by the fact
that both are used in certain milling pro
cesses.
The doctor became a member of Live
Oak Lodge No. 61, F. and A. M., in ISS7.
â He was also a member of Rio Grande
Chapter No. 4, Royal Arch Masons, of
Albuquerque. N. M., and Pilgrim Com
mandery, Knights Templar, of the same
place. He was a member of the Independ
ent Order of Odd Fellows and also of the
National Eclectic Medical Association of
Forest. Ohio. He was about 55 years of.
age and leaves no known relatives.

THE BUBONIC BCfIRD OF HEALTH-
WITH the abortive attempt to create a scare by
a report of the appearance of the bubonic j
igue in this city, the Board of Health ap
reward the followers and to serve the pur- ;
- of Dan Burns and the Southern Pacific Com- ,
n it? career and gave the public an illustra
:' the tactics on which it relies for success.
The board cannot be accused of a lack of energy nor
of a lack of audacity. Scarcely was it in office when it
:. looking around for a chance to serve its mas
ters and to gain prestige for itself. It did not wait
lÂ«.r an opportunity to come. It made one out of what
was virtually nothing. It did not restrain itself in
moderation in exploiting of the manufactured op
portunity, but set about starting a panic with the au
dacity of men who have no scruples and are reckless
hat may be the consequences to others so long
mething be gained for themselves.
. Dr. Barbat, who serves Dan Burns as family phy
sician and as representative on the Board of Health,
a brother who has a laboratory and who is ser
viceable to the board as a '"bacteriologist." The will
ing germ-hunter examined the bodies of two Japan
ese aho were drowned in trying to swim ashore from
the Nippon Maru and declared he found evidence that
they were infected with the bubonic plague â the most
dreadful pestilence of the pestilential Orient. Thus it
was made to appear that the plague had reached San
Francisco, and the board got ready to profit by the
which was expected to follow.
Two advantages were to be gained from the panic.
In tl ice a great and valuable service was to
xhv I'acihc Mail Steamship Company
iuring a rival line. If the public could be per
ed that the competing line of steamships brought,
[ence to the city, Huntington would have on the
n something like the monopoly he abuses on
That far the service was rendered to the rail
road bosses, and no doubt the bosses appreciated it at
its true worth.
The second service was to Dan Burns himself. Had
the board and its bacteriologist succeeded in causing
a general alarm, it could with more pretension ask |
from the Supervisors a large appropriation, ostensibly:
for the purification and the protection of the health of'
the city, but really to make places for the idle and;
worthless members of the Burns push. Thus the .
board would have increased its prestige in the city
and augmented the strength of the Burns ring.
The attempt to create a scare was abortive, but it
none the less succeeded in doing the city considerable
harm. In the East the character of the Board of
Health is not understood, nor are its purposes com
prehended. Therefore the story of the bubonic plague ',
in this city has been widely published there and ex
aggerated. Many a tourist who might have come to
San Francisco has been turned away by this false
rumor started for the purpose of making business for
the Pacific Mail and doing politics for Dan Burns.
Thus the first effect of the operations of the board has
been to injure the whole community to an extent
which it is not possible at this time to estimate.
From the way the board has begun it is easy to
foresee how it will continue. The welfare of the com
munity is to count as nothing. The main object is to
devise a means of forcing the Supervisors to increase
the appropriations for the board. Fortunately, the
first move was so gross a blunder that the people can
readily perceive the nature of the trap that was pre
pared. Hereafter the public will be wary. It will take
something more than a report from the bacteriologist
Barbat to start a scare or induce the Supervisors to
intrust more public money for the pay of the Burns
push.
Oom Paul is said to be fencing diplomatically with
British statesmen to gain time until the rainy season
sets in and military operations in the Transvaal will be
doubly dangerous for British troops. Oom Paul must
be reading the reports of General Otis from the Phil
ippines.
Mrs. Yda Addis Storke of Santa Barbara must
think that Attorney Jackson has four or five lives.
Prussic acid, chloroform and two pistols certainly
ought to silence an ordinary lawyer forever.
Senator Gorman's friends claim that his health is
poor. It is not half so poor as his chances for the
Presidential nomination.
MR. BARRETT, DIPLOMAT.
DURING Mr. Cleveland's last term everybody
was surprised by his discovery of Mr. John
Barrett, and his appointment of that person
as Minister to Siam. Mr. Barrett's experience in
diplomacy consisted of inexperience in journalism,
which honorable profession he had failed to adorn as
a reporter for a paper in Oregon. He moved on the
land of the white elephant, and longed for great
things. Our British brethren have been for years
carefully cultivating the spirit of imperialism in all
American Consuls and Ministers in Asia. Colonel
Denby was carefully coached in that line by the Brit
ish Minister in Peking. He had not been there long
until he sent up a loud and bitter complaint about the
quarters furnished him to live in. The British Min
ister had a compound all to himself, and servants in
livery and raiment that tied honors with the yellow
jacket and peacock feather of old Li Hung Chang.
Colonel Denby stayed in Peking twelve years and saw
the British Minister lord it over the Celestials until j
he longed to represent an empire and take np the
white man's burden of kicking some poor devil
smaller than himself. The same influences were '<
around Diplomat Barrett at Bangkok. The English
newspaper there received him with a flourish of head- j
lines and immediately acquired an American circula- j
tion, for he sent marked copies to everybody in the
country of whom he had ever heard. The Bangkok
Times and Barrett were like organ and organist. He
settled ah American's claim against Chulalongkorn
for killing an elephant and burning a woodpile. The
Times hailed it as a diplomatic triumph that would
have roused the envy of Hastings and Clive and that
had made all Asia tremble with fear while not thrilled
with admiration. To Mr. Barrett the Philippine war
was an opportunity. Having been taught by his Brit
ish tutors in Siam that the people of Asia are not to
be treated as human beings, he was a tool filed and
fitted to the British need of some one to keep the
English imperial policy in countenance. He has re
turned to his own, his native land, like Denby, to mi
i struct the mere American taxpayer, who only fur
j nishes the money and merely sends his sons to be
j killed or rot alive under a vertical sun, in his duty to
! violate the constitution in order that Barretts and
I Denbys may have whole compounds and liveries and
!do diplomacy in Asia up to the British standard. He
j has been, and probably still is, raising his voice in the
j Eastern States in favor of imperialism and in convey
i ance of gross misinformation about the Philippines.
j His representation of the beauties of a tropical cli
i mate and its adaptation to our race is the result either
;of great ignorance or unbridled mendacity. Races
j are found planted by nature where the physical condi
tions are adapted to them. Our race was placed in
j the temperate zone, and the tropical races were
I planted in the torrid zone. When Mr. Barrett can
i point to any estimable number of temperate zone peo
! pie born in the third generation in the tropics, he may
'' relieve himself of a suspicion of being either a fool or
I a falsifier.
But it is when he discusses the politics of imperial
ism that Barrett shines with all the brilliancy of a '
mud nimbus. He declares that we must keep the
Philippines because we bought them from Spain, and
must hold them, no matter what may be the objection
of the people. In discussing alternatives he says:
"We cannot honorably sell the Philippines, for we will
be bartering away 8,000,000 natives, unless they them
selves favor said sale."'
That illuminates the Barrett intellect. We may make
war on Spain because she governed people against
their consent. We bought the Philippines without
consent of the natives, and are making devastating
war on them to establish our government over them
without their consent. Yet, cries Barrett, "it will be
dishonorable to sell them without their consent." Is
it more dishonorable to sell than to buy people with
out their consent? Mr. Barrett has at last furnished
an imperial standard of honor. It is honorable to buy
an unwilling people, to make destructive war upon
them and to answer their cry for mercy with the de
mand for unconditional surrender, to call them rebels
because they resist being sold to us, but it would be
dishonorable to sell them to another buyer unless they
are willing!
Long may Barrett's diplomatic tongue wag as an
imperialist tocsin!
THE MAYOR AND_THE: PLEDGE.
\ VIGOROUS and persistent efforts are now being
made to induce the Supervisors to increase the
appropriation set apart for the Fire Department
in the estimates for the coming year recently reported
by the Finance Committee. Protests against any re
duction in the effective force of the department come
from all quarters, and it is not to be denied that in
many respects the arguments of the protesters are
well founded. If, however, the estimate for the Fire
Department be increased there must be a correspond
ing deduction made from the appropriation of some
other branch of the municipal administration, or the
dollar limit pledge must be broken.
To obtain counsel and advice as to the best means
of providing adequately within the dollar limit for the
needs of all departments of the city government, the
Supervisors have referred the estimates to the Mer
chants' Association for consideration. The judgment
of that association will undoubtedly be valuable. The
members of it are men who have long taken an active
interest in municipal affairs and are strenuous sup
porters of progress with economy. They desire to see
an efficient administration of the city, a liberal policy
of improvements in streets, sewers, parks and other
public works, and they also desire the maintenance of
that dollar limit pledge to which most of them are
bound by their public declarations as clearly as are
the Supervisors by their campaign promises.
The Merchants' Association, however, is, after all,
an unofficial body. It has not been charged by the
responsibilities of office to make a thorough and com
prehensive study of the relation of municipal finances
to the work of administration. The counsel it will
give will doubtless be excellent, but it cannot be final.
The Supervisors, after receiving the report from the
association, should hold it for the consideration of the
Mayor. That officer, as chief executive of the city, is
charged with the duty of investigating all such mat
ters, and his advice ought by all means to be sought
and obtained by the Supervisors before they fix the
estimates and the appropriations for the year.
The expediency of consultation with the Mayor is
exceptionally strong in this case by reason of the fact
that Mr. Phelan is not only Mayor of the city, but is
and has been ever since he entered office the most
conspicuous advocate in public life of the dollar
limit. He has repeatedly asserted that a revenue de
rived from a tax rate of $i on the $100 on the basis of
an assessed valuation of taxable property of $350,000.
--ooa, would be amply sufficient for all the needs of the
municipality. He has insisted that it would provide
not only for the maintenance in unimpaired vigor of
all departments of the government, but for such im
provements as the progress of the city demands.
It was because of public confidence in these asser
tions made by Mr. Phelan after two years in office
that he was re-elected Mayor in an election in which
his party suffered overwhelming defeat. To him,
THE SAX FRAy CISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JULY 11, 1899.
therefore, does a considerable body of the people look
for counsel in the problem now confronting the mu
nicipality. The Supervisors should obtain his aid in
shaping the estimates. He should not be deprived of
any of the glory of a successful solving of the com
plication, nor should he be permitted to shirk any of
the responsibility should evil result from reductions in
the appropriations asked for by the heads of depart
ments.
As for the Supervisors themselves, their duty is
clear. They were elected upon a pledge to limit the
tax rate to one dollar on the hundred. Let them keep
that pledge in letter and in spirit, and the public will ,
have no right to condemn them. â¢
THE COMING YfJCHT RfICE.
REPORTS concerning the trials made by the Co
lumbia and the Shamrock give reason for be
lieving the coming yacht race will be the best
ever sailed. Both the challengers and the defenders
seem well satisfied with their boats, and apparently
' : have good reason for their satisfaction.
The Columbia not only made a successful run in her
trial trip, but since then has been matched with the
De;'tnder, that held the cup against the Valkyrie, and
| has shown herself to be a fleeter and a better yacht in
| everj respect than that famous and victorious craft.
The last contest between the two was in some re
bpects unfortunate, inasmuch as both yachts sailed the
wtcng course, but the error did not in any way pre
vent a fair test of the comparative merits of the two.
The race was sailed over a twenty-six mile course,
: and in covering that distance the Columbia outsailed
the Defender by three minutes and thirteen seconds.
Granting the Defender a time allowance of two mm:
-: utes, the Columbia will still have the victory by more
than a minute. From the results of the trial experts
draw the conclusion that since the Columbia wins
over a twenty-six mile course by that much time in
her present condition, she can, when properly tuned
iup by next September, beat 'the Defender over a
thirty mile course by as much as five minutes, which
is all that is required of her.
While the Columbia is thus satisfying to the expec
tations of Americans, the Shamrock has given hardly
less satisfaction to British yachtsmen. She has not
yet been tested in a race against a fleet yacht of the
first class, but her trial trip has been remarkably suc
cessful. One of the experts who watched her is re
ported to have said: '"We have a flyer. We have a
yacht much better than anything before known here.
Ii the Americans beat us they will have to work hard
for it. They are not going to have a run away
triumph."
From all reports it appears the Shamrock, much
more than the Columbia, is a novelty in the way of
yacht construction. In this contest the Americans
! are the conservatives and the Irish challenger is the
! radical innovator. It is said there is scarcely a bit of
wood about her. Her entire hull is of thin metal.
The mainmast is of hollow steel and all the rigging is
of wire. No expense has been spared in fitting her.
Her sails are not made of common canvas, but of cloth
woven from the finest sea island cotton, and represent
the best work of men who claim to be the foremost ;
sailma"kers in the world.
For all that she has been constructed in a British |
shipyard, the Shamrock will be essentially an Irish
yacht, as her owner designed her to be. Her crew
is Irish, and in the recent trial trip their work elicited
no little praise by reason of its swiftness, its efficiency
and the clock-like regularity with which every portion
of it was performed.
All that yacht builders can do to make the great '
race a satisfactory contest between the two foremost
racing and sponing people in the world has been done. ;
The rest remains for the yachtsmen and their crews.
The irritation caused by the Dunraven outbreak over
the last race has passed away from both sides, and the j
public can look forward to a contest of friendly rivalry
in skill and seamanship.
DOMESTIC SERVICE IN BOSTON.
â¢ "ROM a time so remote that the memory of man
runneth not to the contrary there has been a
sound of lamentation in the United States over
the problems of domestic service, and the burden of
the wailing has been that American girls, through a
false pride, object to such service and refuse to per- 1
form it. Now, however, there comes from the East
a story of a nature so contrary to the old one it has
all the interest of a genuine surprise party.
In a recent number of the Independent Mrs. Eliza
beth Stuart Phelps Ward, who lives in the vicinity
of Boston, asserts that in "the present chaotic condi
tion of American society many a woman in domestic
service may be as well born and as well educated as
her employer. Hundreds of women are ready to en
ter kitchens and serve in dining-rooms who would not
have considered such a step possible fifteen years
ago."
In proof of her assertion Mrs. Ward cites her own
experience and says: "Some time since I advertised
for a woman to do the housework of my family and
received eighty applications, of which not more than
two or three were from professional servants. Dress- j
makers, clerks, saleswomen, widows, nurses, stenog- j
raphers, respectable American women by the score, :
were ready to ask admission to a home where they
would be well treated, and perform its roughest du
ties. The widow of a physician, a well-bred lady, her
self accustomed in her past life to her own servants, j
applied to a suburban household for permission to j
carry on its domestic work. The same day brought a !
similar request from a teacher educated in three of our
leading institutions â one a college."
This story is proof of much more than of the point
it was cited to prove. It is an evidence not only of
the breaking down of former prejudice against domes
tic service, but also of the increasing severity of the*
struggle for existence in the older States. When an i
educated teacher, a graduate of three of the leading !
institutions of New England, and manifestly indus- ;
trious and willing to work, has to seek and almost
beg for employment as a servant, it is evident condi
tions have changed since the days when even the
poorest American girl scorned to be a servant and
would hardly consent to be a "help."
Mrs. Ward's statement is a surprise indeed, and the
surprise is not a pleasant one. It changes the aspect
of the servant girl problem, however, in an important
respect. Since college-bred girls have taken to
service for a living, it is clearly the duty of the em
ploying class to meet them half way and make the
living worth having.

CAPTAIN E. H.
PLUMMER GETS
A PROMOTION
Made a Lieutenant
Colonel.
JOINS THE THIRTY -FIFTH
GENERAL SCHWAN ARRIVES EN
' ROUTE TO MANILA.
Lieutenant Colonel Maus Assumes
His Duties as Inspector General
of the Department of the
Pacific.
Captain Edward H. Plummer, senior aid
1 to Major General Shaft er, was agreeably
surprised yesterday to receive a telegTam
from Assistant Adjutant General Carter
| informing him that he had been commis
sioned lieutenant colonel of the Thirty
fifth Infantry Volunteers. Captain Plum-
I mer's promotion la well deserved and
comes without solicitation on his part, !
although it is said the appointment was I
recommended by General Shatter. As
: Colonel Kobbe of the Third Artillery, who
, has been â  appointed to command the i
Thirty-fifth, is now at Manila, the or- j
ganization of the regiment will probably i
be left entirely with the lieutenant colonel.
The regiment will he organized at Van
couver barracks and will be recruited en
! tirely from the Pacific Coast.
Captain Plummer is a native of Mary
land and is regarded as one of the most
efficient officers of the regular army. He i
entered "West Point July 1, IST3, as a cadet \
J from Maryland. On his graduation on j
June 15, IST", he was appointed a second
lieutenant in the Tenth United States j
Infantry. On November 29, 1894, he was j
promoted to the first lieutenancy in the !
same regiment. He was commissioned a
captain in the Tenth on April 26, 1888. At
the outbreak of the war with Spain he
was assigned to the Fifth Army Corps
under General Shafter. During the cam
paign around Santiago he was quarter
master at General Shafter's headquarters.
The proficiency with which he performed j
his duty as quartemaster attracted the !
most favorable comment from his superior i
officers and ultimately obtained for him
the position of senior aid upon the staff
of General Shafter. When General Shafter j
returned from Cuba Captain Plummer ac- i
companied him, and since that time he
has been the general's principal assistant. !
Lieutenant Colonel M. P. Maus has ar- i
rived and assumed his duties as inspector
general of this department, relieving |
Major Edward Field. Major Robert H.
Noble has been attending to the duties |
of the position since Major Field's illness. |
General Schwan, who has been ordered ;
to Manila and expects to sail on the City I
of Para, is in the city and is being enter
tained by Major Noble. General Schwan
commanded a division of General Miles'
army at the invasion of Porto Rico, and
since the war has been acting as assist
ant adjutant general.
Captain Joseph B. Bachelor and Captain
Crane of the Twenty-fourth Infantry re
ported for duty at the Presidio yesterday.
Surgeon Major Mosely says there is a I
noticeable improvement in the class of re- i
cruits being received at the Presidio since i
the Government made the rule holding j
all recruiting and medical officers respon
sible for accepting recruits who have sub- â 
sequently been rejected. The latest batch !
to be discharged as unsuited for the I
service are: John Hair. Samuel Hayward, j

DISCUSSED TEMPEBANCE.
Rev. John A. B. Wilson Sharply Crit
icizes Supporters of Saloons.
In a discussion on "Temperance" by
the members of the Methodist Episcopal
Ministers' Union yesterday morning Rev.
; F. D. Bovard of Santa Rosa f*nd Rev.
! John A. B. Wilson of this city delivered
! forcible arguments on the subject. The
I former criticized the, attempt of Henry J.
Crocker to form a wine trust, which, he
! contended, would injure the cause of ter
n perance in his section. Dr. Wilson criti-
c ized the administration and condemned
| the canteen system. In part he said:
I have no controversy with my brethren on
the question of temperance. We all believe In
the prohibition of the liquor traffic upon prin
ciple. Our difference is upon the met.- 01
applying these principles. I take the position
that it is a great politic*! question as well
as a moral one. and it must have a great â 
political party in back of it. and no part> can
take it up because Issues make parlies, noi
parties make issues. ' , ..
The exeat issue of tariff has divided the
whole country into two hostile camps for years,
and yet the difference between the two bills _Oj
the various parties would not pay the drink mil
of the nation for two months. Twelve hundred
and fifty million dollars goes over the counters
of saloons every year for the debauchery of our
people. Nine-tenths of the crime is due to this
cause and 150.000 men are slain every year
through its evil effects. There is a hue and
cry and a national investigation because 01 |
the unsanitary camps in which 6000 of our sol
dier boys have died horrible deaths, but no j
investigation as to the ruin, dishonor de
bauchery and the final slaughter of the LAOtO
men through the drink question. And no man
In . politics .lares to fay one word in criticism
of the infamous traffic, from the- President of
the United States to the town Constable, fof i
the reason that the liquor men cast their votes
in "blocks" for the men who favor them in :
legislation and administration.
The diplomacy of the administration requires
that Protestant missionaries should not go to â 
Manila for their work, but has admitted 400
saloons to be opened in the city limits for the
debauchery of our soldier boys, who, respond
ing to their country's call, go out there in i
patriotic fervor, and who will come back to ua
ruined, not by the bullets of the Filipinos,
but by the sajoons supported by the adminis- ;
tration for their destruction.
Rev. 'Franklin Rhoda read a paper be
fore the Presbyterian Ministers' Union
entitled "Are We Limiting the Holy One
of Israel?" It proved a learned discourse.
A general discussion followed the reading
of the paper, in which Rev. Messrs. Bur
nett, Landon. Herriott. Clark. Reynolds, i
Fraser and Hunter participated.
Rev. G. B. Hatch addressed the Congre- :
gational ministers on John G. Whittier.

Row With the Federal Authorities
Still Goes Merrily
On.
Leon Dennery. secretary of the Board ol
Health, will make common ca use with
the Fire Department to-night and appear
i before the Finance Committee of the
Board of- Supervisors to urge upon that
body the necessity of an expansion of the
tax apportionment for the expenses of the
Health Department.
When the old Board of Supervisors fixed
the amount that the Board of Health was
I to receive it was not known that so many
! of Dan Burns' henchmen were to be un
foaded upon it. and all the figuring of
which Dennery _ls capable has failed to
make it go round. Consequently Mr Burns
has decided that the taxpayers will have
to put up the difference, and that hi 3
political debts may be paid Dennery will
to-night appeal to the Supervisors.
Dr. Barbara microbes are still giving
rise to some rather warm correspondence
between the municipal and the Federal
Health officers. Dr. Kinyoun of the Ma
rine Hospital service last week ad
! dressed a letter to the board in which he
severely criticized the findings of Dr.

anese from the Nippon Maru. Dr. Barbat
declared that he bad discovered and made
successful cultures of 'the true germ of
the dread bubonic plague from saliva
taken from the glands of the two Japan
ese Dr. Kinyoun ridiculed the statement
and criticized the methods by which Dr.
Barbat arrived at his conclusion, les

When this petition had been read
Supervisor Perrault said that he wished
to know if the speakers favored the ',
dollar limit. The board had been
pledged to this limit and he could not
see how reductions were to be made
and the pledge honored. The Mer
chants' Association had pvomised to
submit estimates an.! Supervisor Per
rault wanted to see them. He urged
that the whole matter be referred to
the Finance Committee. Supervisor
Uckmann placed this recommendation
in a formal motion. Before a vote was
taken Fire Commissioner Bohen and
Chief Sullivan protested, hut the mo

THE SAN FBA:N CISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JULY 11, 1899.
Committee will listen to the discussion
to-night.
ROUTINE WORK.
Petitions and Objections Keep
the Supervisors Busy.
The Board of Supervisors met in regu
lar session yesterday afternoon. The May
or was absent and Supervisor Collins oc
cupied the chair. Regular routine busi
ness gave way to the reading of petitions
from many districts against the curtail
ment of the appropriation for the Fire De
partment. After this question was disposed
of the regular procedure was taken up.
The North End property owners, fearful
that the $1 tax limit will be rescinded, ad
dressed the following letter to the board:
To the Honorable Board of Supervisors-
Gentlemen: As taxpayers and voters of the
city, we hear with dismay the fact that
the proposed tax rate shall be $1.07. We
have reason to believe the members of your
honorable body will carry out and live up
to the solemn pledges you took when elect
ed to your offices. There is absolutely no
good reason why the tax rate should not
be 94 cents, as stated by the Assessor;
certainly not more than $1. Useless offi
cials, clerks who do nothing, large, fat con
tractors and rake-offs can be dispensed
with easily and without loss. Every on*
of the taS -eating officials should be re
stricted to what an ordinary business man
can easily run his businessâ fair amount
without provision for a lot of parasites
who eat out the substance of the munici
pal treasury.
The so-called St. Mary's Square scheme,
panhandle scheme and similar schemes for
filching the taxpayers should be abandon
ed and the schemers compelled to foot the
bills. The taxpayers should not be com
pelled to pay a lot of real estate agents
j who find themselves with a lot of unsal
able or unrentable property outrageous
prices for their holdings in order to in
. crease our tax-paying burdens by estab
lishing useless squares or panhandles. We
have enough squares, and Golden Gate Fork
end the Presidio afford all the recreation
ground and are even then only Infrequently
utilized, though we pay hundreds of thou
sands of dollars to maintain them. We
earnestly hope the board will strictly ad
here to the dollar limit without going bo
yond It for any special purpose whit-iver.
Let the tax rate be $1 or less for ill pur
poses, which, with the extraordinary State
rate, about (estimated) 58 cents, will be
sufficiently burdensome.
North End Property Owners' Association,
J. WILLIAMS. Secretary.
A petition "raying for the creation of a
free employment bureau to be maintained
by the city and county was referred to
the License and Ordinance Committee. It
was signed by several hundred of the
leading business houses of the city.
The Board of Appraisers appointed to
find out just how much the panhandle
scheme will cost submitted to the board
an estimate of the coin it will need during
the year to come and a request that it be
provided for in the tax levy. The sum re
quired is 115,000, of which 112,810 is to be
used "for salaries of members of board
and attaches," and another 51000 for "ad
ditional clerical assistance and incidental
expenses." The petition was referred to
the Finance Committee.
Supervisor E. 1.. Perrault introduced a
resolution that all supplies hereafter fur
nished any municipal department should
;be awarded by contract. The resolution
â  was killed.
I The surplus of $33,000 from the street
liKhtinsc fund was turnr-rt into the general
fund and the Treasurer ordered to make

ACTION TAKEN ONE DAY AHEAD
QUARANTINED PASSENGERS TO
BE RELEASED TO-DAY.
All Express Themselves as Highly
Plenscd With Their Courteous
Treatmentâ A Baby Girl
Born in Quarantine.
United States Surveyor of the Port
Chauncey M. St.. John took a force of Cus
tom-house inspectors, examiners, apprais
ers and laborers to the quarantine station
on Angel Island yesterday afternoon and
released the baggage of the passengers of
the Nippon Maru. who have been unwill
ing sojourners there for the past two
weeks. Early this morning the quaran
tine will be lifted by the Federal authori
ties and the grateful prisoners will be al
lowed to leave a spot whi'h will always
have rather unpleasant recollections for
them.
It was entirely owing to the courtesy of
the Custom-house officers that the bag
gage was examined to-day, and the work
was done expeditiously. But two hours
were consumed in handling a mass of
packages which covered the wharf, and
many were the encomiums passed upon thÂ«
officers for the creditable way in which
they performed their duties. Inspectors
of Immigration H. H. Scheil and A. de la
Torre were on hand, but had little to do.
The brunt of their labors will come to-
I day. when the steerage passengers are
released.
The people who have been sequestered
in the interest of public health were pro
fuse in their expressions of thanks to the
steamship company and to Dr. Klnyoun,
Federal quarantine officer, for their earn
est efforts to make their enforced stay on
the island as pleasant as possible under
the circumstances. The days have passed I
agreeably enough, and the courtesy of the
Custom-house authorities in passing the
baggage one day ahead was deeply ap
preciated by all concerned.
An event which served to add interest to
the isolation was the birth of a little girl
two days ago. The mother, Mrs. May
â Jackson Hill, was attended by Dr. Kin
youn and Mrs. 1 >r. Annie Walter Fearn,
one of the passengers. ;ind a medical mis
sionary. The mother is the wife of a
royal engineer in her Majesty's service in
the Orient. Considerable entertainment
was afforded in the naming of the baby, i
A request was made thai she be named
"Quarantina Angelina." but the mother;
compromised on Margaret Frances.
George Newhall and Thomas D. McKay,
Oriental passenger agent of a dozen lines,
were jubilant at their unexpected release,
and expressed themselves as highly
pleased at everything except the fact that ;
they were obliged to sleep In one room,
where there were thirteen iron beds, and :
they rather thought that the cubic air
law had been violated.
STRUCK WITH AN IRON BAR.
Hung Dung Chow, a Chinese Mer
chant. Attacked by Two High
binders.
Hung Purer Chow, a Chinese merchant
at 60S Jackson Btreet, swore to a com
plaint In Judge Mogan'a court yesterday
for 'he arrest of Lee Wee Too and an
other highbinder on the charge of as-
Bault with a deadly weapon.
The complaining witness has been in
terested in a civil suit for damages
against a Stockton boat, and yesterday
morning the two highbinders called at
his and demanded indemnity from
him. . When he refusc-i one of them
struck him on the head with an iron
bar, which he had concealed under his
blouse, knocking him Benseless. He had a
lump on hl.= head ns hiK ;>s a man's fist.

Mrs. Elizabeth Lung filed answer yes
terday to the complaint of her husband,
l>r. George A. Lung, surgeon of tho
cruiser Philadelphia, who seeks a divorce
on the grounds of Intemperance and
cruelty, in which she enters general denial
to the many allegations of the complaint.
She denii s that she has been guilty of in

cruelly: that she was ever incapacitated

that she caused her husband great mental
suffering. She asks that a decree of di

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW y<"-i:k stock market.
NEW YORK July 10. â The continued tight
ness in the money market precipitated liquida
tion of the speculative accounts to-day wh!di
resulted in losses in value ranging from $1 to $3
a share in all the principal active stocks traded
In. Heavy selling: for London account marked
the opening en the Exchange, and as the day
progressed the successive calling of loans re
sulted in the raising of the loan, rate to 7 per
cent. This rate forced many speculators on the
loiig side to close out. There were important
points of weakness besides in one or two prom
inent stocks, of which the boars were quick to
take advantange. and which was a patent influ
ence in the tendency to decline. Most conspicu
ous of these was People's Gas. which opened
at 117. against 120 V on the last sale Saturday.
There were heavy offerings of this stock, but,
determined support worked a quick rally of
I\. Afterward it fell below the opening price
and closed with a net lass of nearly 3 points.
The motive of the selling was the reported
plan cf a rival company to organize a com
peting service upon the expiration of the pres
ent agreement. The demands made upon the
Metropolitan Street Railway Company on be
' half of its employes and the danger of a
costly str.ke caused the stock of that com
pany to drop ?A S at one lime. The dealings in
it v.ere not heavy and the tone was feverish
throughout, the last sale showing a net loss
or 2 1 -. All the local traction stocks were af
fectea sympathetically, Manhattan losing 3
points and Br.vkiyn Transit over 2 on the day.
Sugar was a.so notably weak, the selling being
credited to realizing by speculative holders.
The combined wt-aknes.s of these influential
eto< ks was sufficient to cause a demoralized i
feeling throughout the group of industrials. In
the railroad I.st the weakness was more re- j
Ftricted to the stocks which have beei re- I
centiy (>UÂ£hed up by speculative manipulation, i
Pennsylvania. New York Central. Atchison j
preferred, Burlington. Reading first preferred !
and other stocks equally prominent in the
.speculative world were at one time 2 points or
more below Saturday's price.
The grangers generally, the coalers and the !
trunk lines declined from 1 to 2 point? Trie !
Southern and Southwestern stocks as a rule |
Ehowed resistance to the decline and their net I
losses are for the most part srcall fractions, j
The steel stocks also were a little affected by [
the prevailing weakness. The break in prices â¢
was due to the miscalculation of operators as j
to the period of relief expected in the money \
market. The d>?lay in this matter seems to be j
due to uneasiness causd in foreign centers by ;
the situation in the Transvaal. France was
an eager bidder for gold in the London market
to-day and the rate of discount in London was
marked up a fraction, although'ca'l money was !
easier thcrv. Thf- cnll loan rate went to 7 per i
cent in New York, but the only effect on the |
sterling ex.hange market was a fall of a frac- !
tlon In the rate for long standing. The pres- j
sure on London was from Parir. and was re- !
fleeted here in sales estimated as high as 50,- |
C*Ki shares. The shrinkage in values, coming on I
the lew level of the New Yor* bank reserve,
necessitated the calling of loar.s.. which in
many cases It was found difficult to replace
with other accommodations. The market i
showed very feeble rallying power and closed
very slightly above the lowest. In the early
dealings there was a large demand for he
Southwest seconds, which gained \. all of i
which was subsequently lost. Bonds generally i
were wÂ»ak Tntal sales, par value. $2.7.J7,0X>.

adequate to the Imperial Government, but It l
is declared satisfactory to the. Cape Premier.
: This suggests the possibility of serious trouble >
with the Cape. Money also was dearer and
consols went down U. Americans were weak
throughout the day. Th" New York bank j
statement was not liked, and it is fearfd a
worse situation is coming. The market hung '
under parity until the afternoon, hen Ni w |

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JULY 11. 1899,
! 72%Â©73 c ranged from 72%072T&C to T3Sc and ,
closed at 73c bid. The unusual anxiety over |
the approaching Government crop report was
| evident at the beginning and put a damper on
trade The seaboard reported a continued
export demand, putting the engagements for .
to-day at 40. The market showed consider
able weakness during the early trading, and
the lowest prices of the day were recorded
In the first hour. Besides the apprehension of
i a bearish Government report, the market was
! depressed by lower English and Continental
! cables and by favorable weather throughout
â  the Wheat belt. The constantly ncreas m !
world's visible supply was not at all encour- ,
I aging to prospective buyers. The increase last
week was 422 000 bushels. The world's shlp
! ment amounted to 7.663.000 bushels. After tne
I market touched T2%@7Bc a better feelins mani
fested itself. Shorts bought moderately and a
Blow advance took place, the price rallying to
73Â»ic before the demand â  eased. The shorts .
apparently had a good deal of confidence in
their position, and support from that source
was more or less prominent on every decline.
The market ruled very dull during the after- ,
noon and gradually declined to 73c. It was
b-inglng that price at the close
Corn was dull and weak all day in sympathy
with Wheat. September closed J*Â®^. LÂ° we J- . ;
â¢ oats were Influenced entirely by heat and i
Corn. September closed â -â¢.â ,â  lower.
Provisions were slow, but firm. Hot re
ceipts were heavy, but outside support was
good and selling by shorts restricted. Prices
kept within a narrow range, slightly higher
than Saturday. At the close September Pork

The official report from the Consolidated Cali
fornia and Virginia mine for the past week
reads as follows: "The Comstock Pumping
Association has been engaged In the following
work at the C. and C. shaft during the pa.st
week; 1400 levelâ west drift has been ex
tended IS feet; total. 67S feet. The face is in
soft porphyry witlj seams of clay and occa
sional spots of quartz. The clay walls that
we have yet passed through are crushing the
timbers so that we had to relieve them during
the past week. We have to run 35 feet to
make connection with crosscut No. 2 from the
Con. Virginia shaft. 1650 levelâ Necessary re
pairs are being made on this level. 1750 levelâ
ThÂ« stopes have been extended one set south
and one set west, and in doing so we have ex
tracted 66 tons of ore of a gold value of $18
per ton. From the second floor we axe follow-
Ing: the clay wail to the southwest with a drift.
This clay "wall having shown spots of ore, we
will, as soon as possible, cut through it .and
see what Is beyond. On the sill floor at the
north end of the ttopes we ran a crosscut.
23 feet east; face in porphyry and quartz assay
ing Jo per ton. We have stopped this crosscut
and we are now sinking a winze on a hang-
Ing wall clay in this east crosscut. The winze
is now down rive feet in quartz, with streaks
of clay and porphyry and some ore. 1960 levelâ
The station on this level and 30 feet of the
south drift has been cleaned up, the face of
the later being in caved rock. We cannot tell
the condition of the drift beyond the cave.
We found It necessary to put In a small pump
to drain the seepage water out of this level,
said water being held back by the slime. Since
reaching the station we had occasion to make
but. two short runs with the pump, and for
the last twenty-four hours we have not run ,
the pump at all. We may, however, find a lit
tle water in the drift as we go south. All work
In the mine was suspended between the morn-
Ings of the 4th and sth. The machinery on the I
surface and underground is In good order and :
working nicely/
In the Ophir mine no underground work has \
been done the past week through the Ophir |
shaft. Central tunnelâ The joint Mexican east \
crosscut was extended 26 feet; total length, 46 j
feet: face in porphyry. At this point the east
crosscut will be stopped until the Joint west
crosscut has been driven to the footwall of the
vein. The joint west crosscut will be started j
this forenoon, Sutro tunnel connectionâ
Sutro tunnel direct connection was extended
22 feet: total, 228 feet: face in hard han-ing
wall rock. The formation in this drift for 14
. feet west of the vein, mentioned in last week's :
report, is clay and soft porphyry- The ground
will have to be retimbered. We are putting
in a switch and air pipe connections so that â¢
the vein may be prospected north . and south ;
as soon as the main west drift has been fid
vanced far enough not to interfere with the j
work. Work has been continued In the south- j
west drift and the drift extended 7 feet: total
length, 54 feet: face in quartz containing spots |
of ore. This vein, while improving as we fol
low it. is still irregular in form.
In the ('hollar and Potosl mines thÂ» Joint
west tunnel has been advanced during the week .
32 feet: total length. 273 feet: face in city, ;
porphyry and boulders of quartz. On the tun- i
nel level they have one man on repairs. The I
Joint Bullion-Potosi west crosscut has been i
advanced 12 feet: total length. 240 feet: face I
in clay and porphyry. Sutro tunnel level â ]
The Zadig drift has been advanced 10 feet I
during the week: total length. S4S feet; face j
In very hard porphyry.
In the Hale & Norcrnss mine "ie H *â  V

SENTENCED
FOR LIBEL
To Be Imprisoned One Year
in the Santa Barbara
County Jail.
HER MIMING WAY
Yda Addis, the Once Brilliant
Writer, Believed to Be Now
Verging on Insanity.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ» Cull.
SANTA BARBARA, July 10.â Yda Addis
Ptorke, the once brilliant writer of stories,
chiefly relating to Mexican life. Is expect
ed to become a raving maniac at any mo
ment. She appeared in the Superior Court
this morning: to receive sentence on a
charge of writ and mailing libelous
letters to R. F. Winchester, and for which
a jury found her guilty. A large crowd
assembled to see how she would boar up
Tinder the prolonged strain. She came in,
being conducted by Sheriff Stewart, very
slowly, and plainly showed the effects of
the struggle she had on Saturday night
with Attorney Grant Jackson in an at
tempt to murder him. She was quite
lame and several times had to ask for
assistance.
When court was called Senator John J.
Boyce, her attorney, arose and said
that he had prepared a bill of exceptions
and a motion for a new trial, which he
would submit without argument. These,
he said, he had prepared with the aid of
his client, the defendant. Immediately
upon submitting the bill of exceptions and
motion for a new trial Boyce s&id.tha*
the action of the defendant since ihe tfjarf
had been such that as far as he vas per
serially concerned he would have nothing
further to do with the case, but that
hereafter Attorney Carrier, his associate,
would conduct the case. Carrier was ap
pointed to defend Mrs. Storke by the
court, while Boyce entered the case volun
tarily at a later date. Boyce conducted
the case himself, Carrier not being heard
at all. Senator Boyce'a decision came as
a surprise to the defendant, who al
though she has abused him on the street
for the result of her trial, hardly expected
him to desert her.
After a short conversation with Attor
ney Carrier, Mrs. Storke began: "If it
please the court, I will remain seated, as ]
1 am suffering too much pain to stand.
She went on with a. long argument In
well chosen words, principally to the ef
fect that she had secured further testi
mony which would prove beyond a doubt j
that F. N. Guiterrez was the author of
the libelous letters, and that in order to
corroborate this several reputable citizens,
although hosiilo to her, would swear to
affidavits implicating the said Guiterrez.
Senator Bovce arose at this time and
said that he 'was the only attorney that
had been consulted since the trial, and
that no such affidavits had been placed
in his hands.
Mrs. Storke said that she had informed
Boyce that she would swear to such affi
davits.
Judge Oster listened attentively to her,
and at the close stated he believed the
verdict a correct one, and thai the pen
alty for such offense to be utterly inade
quate. He then sentenced her to the full
jjeualtyâ one year In the County Jail.
Tho woman simply said: "I have vio
lated no law." She was then taken to
jail, and there began abusive talk about
her former attorney.
This afternoon Mrs. Storke was taken
to the Police Court for arraignment, un
df-r the charge of an attempt to murder
Grant Jackson. She appeared even
weaker than she had in the afternoon.
Judge Wheaton asked her to give her true
name, and she replied: Yda Addis
ritorke-Jackson. There may be sonic
doubt to the Jackson; but that will Lo :..;
issue in this case."
She contends that a contract "marriage
exists between her and Grant Jackson,
and that she visited his room yesterday
morning not with intent to murder and
commit ar^uult upon him, but as a right |
as his wifo.
Mrs=. Storke's examination will take
place Thursday, and she was required to I
give $suoo bail.
Two six-ehooters, a large bottle of
chloroform contained in a bottle stamped
"fiotica del Aguila Chihuahua Emillo
Tafon," a small bottle containing pruH.sic j
acid; a knife and some cord were taken to
the scene of the attempted murder by
her. Jt is believed by many that it was
her intention, to chloroform Jackson,
which she partially succeeded in doing,
and then mutilate him. After this she
undoubtedly intended to destroy her life
on the spot. This theory is borne out by
the fact ttiat everything necessary for I
carrying these things into execution were j
present; and also because she hovered
about the house all night long waiting for
an opportunity to enter, which she did at
daylight. She admitted to Jackson that |
she had been near the house all night,
stating that .she saw him enter rather
late, light the gas, read some time and
then retire.
Late this afternoon Mrs. Storke ap
peared to have become completely col
lapsed, but her physicians were sum
mon.- . in time to lend aid. It is believed
that the woman i.s about to become a rav
ing maniac. SI â  will allow any one to
interview her, and talks freely about her
case. !

A man may try all sorts of drugs to

"food cure" is the method intended by

Any one can prove the efficacy of the
food cure by making use of the follow-

A dish containing not more than four'

enough good, rich cream to go with
them, some raw or cooked fruit, not
more than two slices of entire wheat
bread, and not more than one cup of j
I'osturn Food Coffee, to be supped, not
drank hurriedly. Let this suffice for
the breakfast.
Let one meal in the day consist of an
abundance of good meat, potato and
one other vegetable.

MORGUE NOW IN POLITICS
County Officials Hold a Session for
the Purpose of Playing Their
Old Game, "Pass the
Buck."
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, July 10.
Now it is the Morgue. Last week ft
was a flagpole. There Is always some
grave issue in local politics.
This morning Supervisor Roeth was to
have received In op< n session of the board
.-.. positive Statement fnrni District At
torney Allen regarding the establishment
of a County Morgue. Mr. Roeth has been
working a great deal In his mind on pub
lic morgues and recently he brought the
mutter up officially. He believes that one
half of the evils of the politics surround
ing the County Coroner will be banished
forever if there be a public morgue. The
District Attorney was ordered last week
to look up the law regarding the Coro
ner, the Morgue and its location. He did
so very fully and thoroughly and now
the Supervisors are just as wise aa they
wt-r.- a week ago regarding the point at
issue, although they are elaborately sup
plied With the law bearing on the sub
ject.
Mr. Allen, scenting the political element
In the agitation, refused to be enticed
into anybody's parlor, and, In the jargon
of the street, he determined to abide by
the letter of the Supervisors' request and
to remain on the fence as regards any
political Interpretation that might be de
rived from the statutes.
In his opinion he told the board that
they had a right to designate where the
office of Coroner shall be located, but the
law .says nothing regarding the location
of the Morgue. Sections and subdivisions
of statutes were quoted at great length
and the Supervisors were informed thai
there is a county official called the Coro
ner- that he must have his office at the
county seat: that the Supervisors must
erect -such public buildings as are neces
sary for the purposes of the county prov
ernment; that the law provides no office
hours for the Coroner, and that he must
summon not less than nine nor more than
fifteen iurors, etc., all of which the Su
pervisors have known since the days of
their political childhood.
Quoting from the wise derisions of the
Supreme Court, the District Attorney
read something about San Joaquin vs.
Budd, in which the august body says that,
it Is the duty of Supervisors to erect and
furnish a Courthouse and to provide ne
cessary offices for county officers, and to
designate the rooms they shall occupy.
Mr. Roeth listened patiently to the re
port but could not get. any satisfaction
from' it. He asked the District Attorney
the blunt question, "Has the board power
to determine the locality of the Morgue?"
"Gentlemen," said Mr. Allen, with his
softest smile, "I have given you the law
regarding your duties. It le not for me to
instruct you what to do."
"Have we the right to provide a pub
lic Morgue?" asked Roeth.
"1 have given yon the. law on the sub
ject " said Mr. Allen, with another smile,
"and I cannot presume to take to myself
your powers of judgment."
* Supervisor Will Church came to Rocth's
assistance and said the board had a right
to get just such an opinion as it desired
from the District Attorney, to which Mr.
Mitchell quickly replied that Mr. Allen
was there to quote the law, and that if
some members of the board wanted him
to sit ac a Supervisor they could elect him
to that office.
Deputy Constable Missing.
OAKLAND, July 10.â Deputy Constable
Roy Torres of East Oakland has been
mining for the past severul weeks and
is Hupposed to have departed for pas
turt-s new. He was wanted in Justice
Larue's court to-day on a charge of bat
tery preferred by \V. L. Gommo. Con
stabie White, who had appointed him,
however, declared that he lost sight of
his deputy for several weeks, and a sub
pena issued failed to bring Torres Into
court. Torres had also sworn to charges
of resisting an officer against A. and W.
Clommo. They appeared in court, but ow
ing to Torres' non-appearance the cases
were dropped.

NATURAL GROWTH, NO BOOM
Fees of Becorder's Office for One Day
Beach Over One Hundred Dol
lars â Unprecedented in
County's History.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 10.
The County Recorder's office has broken
Its record. Not only was last month the
! busiest since January, 1895. but on last
Saturday there were more deeds, re
leases of mortgages and other papers filed
i than on any previous day in the county's
: history. The total fees for the day
' summed up $101 50. Exclusive of about
i ten or twelve gift deeds and deeds of
' trust, mortgages and reconveyances, the
following named tiled deeds of actual
bona fide sales:
G. H. Merrill to Ellen J. Baker, John
P. Beckett to John W. McKenzie, Ed
! Salz to James McKeown, Theodore Wag

Simon Keegan to Charles J. Selby, S. C.

liam C. GfllM to M. Marks.
A large majority of all papers relate to
the great improvement that is gradually
taking place in North Oakland and other
parts of the territory recently annexed.
There is nothing in the nature of a
' "boom" about this steady progress, but
It Is a healthy development of a large
i area that has been held back for lack of
the facilities that are only to be ob
tained by a large municipality.
"Most of the property* that changed
hands in the deeds filed Saturday," said
Recorder Grimm's chief deputy, Robert
Leckie, to-day, "is in the district between
Grove street, San Pablo avenue, Tele
graph avenue and Piedmont. It is all
â¢ice property. Last month was the
highest for the number of deeds and
papers recorded since January, 1895. That
alone Is most wonderful, in view of the
fact thf.t the months of May, June and
July are supposed to be the most quiet
in "the year. The total receipts in our
office for June reached $19$n, while the
total fees for last Saturday was $101 dO.
This month will prove a stunner, 1 verily
believe.
"1 can hardly account for it. There has
been no boom. It is a kind of natural
growth and healthy increase in the real
estate market.
"It seems there has been a great deal
of picking up of cheap properties as well â
where people have been compelled to sell
fur various causes. Rut. withal, present
indications are most gratifying. Oh, Cali
fornia is the greatest changing place in
the world." continued Chief Deputy
Leckie, as he grinned gleefully over the
day's record.
GRACIE FRATES
FATALLY BURNED
OAKLAND. July 10.â Oracle Frates, 4
years of age, was fatally burned this
evening at her homo In San Leandro. The
little girl was playing on the front step
and had taken advantage of an opportu
nity to go Into the house and procure
some matchup. A few minutes later Grade
was In flamed. Her elder brother, who
was playing with her, tore the clothes off
her and" was himself badly burned.
The girl's screams attracted the mother,
who was in the rear of the house, and she
rushed to her assistance and helped ex
tinguish the flames. The child was fear
fully burned and flesh was falling from
many portions of her body. Dr. Tormey
was summoned and did everything possi
ble for the little sufferer, but he pro
nounced her Injuries fatal.

KISSING BUG SCARE
REACHES ALAMEDA
ALAMEDA. July 10.â John McCulley is laid up at his home, 1437 Cottage
street, suffering from fright. He believes that he was attacked by a
kissing bug Saturday night, and in his desperate fight to defend him
self from the poisonous bite of the famous insect he became exhausted
and loHt consciousness. When he regained his senses he was in the arms
of Policeman Ed Hadley, who was wondering what the trouble was with his
fellow officer.
The attack occurred at Morton-street station, where McCulley was wait-
Ing for a narrow-gauge train. McCulley says the bug was not quite as large
rs a blackbird and yet too big to be an Alameda mosqfUo. It flew into the
station nnd made straight for his face. All the kissing oug stories that have
appeared recently flaphed through the officer's mind, and visions of instant
death presented themselves to McCulley in rapid succession. His hands flew
about his head like a windmill In his efforts to ward off the bite of i.c bug,
and when he thought the kisser was about to get in an uppercut under his
guard he gave a yell and fell unconscious on the station floor.
Officer Hadley was attracted by the noise, and thought murder was being
committed. When McCulley regained consciousness the two policemen made
a search for the bug, but were unable to find it. McCulley insists that the
thing was black and unlike any insect he had ever seen before. He is not a
drinking man. He was so overcome by fright that he had to be taken to
hie home, and it may be several days before he Is able to resume hiÂ» duties.
CLAIMS A PART
OF SAN RAFAEL
Duncan McNee's Suit to
Be Prosecuted.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, July 10.â Nearly a year |
| ago i)uncan McNee of San Francisco filed j
: suit in the Superior Court of Marin Coun- J
j ty to obtain possession of valuable prop- j
I erty comprising about an eighth of the i
town site of San Rafael. As time wore j
j on and no summons was served on any of |
I the numerous defendants In the case Mc
! Xee's suit came to be regarded as a gl- j
â  pantlc "game of bluff," and so little was j
thought of It that even those most vitally j
Interested ceased to give it further atten- j
tlon, believing that if the plaintiff made !
any further move It would be simply to j
see if the suit could not be compromised, j
While in this frame of mind the defend- |
ants, one and all. were suddenly thrown j
I Into a state of surprise and consternation j
| to-day by the long delayed summons be- j
i ing served by an agent of plaintiff's at- I
i torney, W. W. Mclntosh. This evidence ]
| of a desire to push the suit to an issue |
I has convinced the interested parties that j
; McNee think* he stands a reasonable â 
chance of winning his case in the courts, j
! and while they are of the opinion that j
their titles are clear there is a good deal ,
of speculation as to whether or not Me- ;
Nee may play a hidden card.
The property concerned in the suit nea ;
: along the line" of the narrow gauge rail- j
way south of B street, and includes the i
i stations of the San Francisco and North
Pacific and the North Pacific Coast Rail
way companif-f and the plant of the San
Rafael (ias Company. McNee claims to ,
i have inherited this valuable property from .
his grandfather, who is alleged to have
held it under the terms of an old Spanish
Among the other defendants, there be- ,
ing fifty in all. are the following: A. F. j
i Hotallng. Beihool Trustee William F. Ma
gee Aaron Shaver, C. O. Jensen, Joseph !
Hoxie and John and Catherine Mangin.
As Aaron Sharer is deceased his widow.
Margaret, probably will be drawn into the j
suit.

Sergeant McCann Stabbed.
- Sergeant William McCann of the Third
Artillery got into a dispute with a large
number of soldiers at California and Du-
no.it streets late last night and was
stabbed in the back, arm, lei? and head.
He was picked up by a policeman and
removed to the Harbor Hospital. The
wounds are not serious. The assailants
ran way immediately after the cutting,
and up to an early hour this morning had
not been arrested.
Curious Custom.
In China it is the custom for guests at din-
ners to run around between the courses. This
Is supposed to keep the diner's digestion in,
good condition, but the nervous, hustling
American needs something else, and there la
nothing better than Hostetter's Stomach Bit-,
ters. If a man or woman is suffering with,
constipation, indigestion or any stomach
trouble, it's their fault if they don't get well.
Hostetter's Stomach Bitters will cure them.

day. The matters considered were the re

The Transport Tartar, Chartered From the Canadian Pacific Railroad.
Santa Fe to communications that the
commission had previously addressed to
these roads, inquiring why they had not
adopted the new grain schedule that is
now in operation on the Southern Pacific.
As the replies showed that the old rates
in the district of the Valley road and
south of Tehachapi, the country tapped
by the Santa Fe, had not been changed
and as the California and Northwestern
is not a grain-carrying road and therefore
not affected by the new rate the replies
were merely read and placed on record,
as they called fur no action by the board.
A .communication from some meat com
panles acroM the bay, complaining of
transportation charges made by the
Southern Pacific, was answered by refer
rins the companies making the complaint
to the Southern Pacific, as the pattern
complained of did not come under the
jurisdiction of the commission.
In th.> early part of next month Com
missioners Blackstork, Kdson and Lau
meister will go East as far as Denver
to attend the annual convention of Rail
road Commissioners that is to be held

Oregon's Soldiers.
TRANSPORT TARTAR ARRIVES
UNDER CHARTER FROM THE
CANADIAN PACIFIC.
Two Men Who Went Egg Poaching
Have Been on the North Far
allon Rocks for Nearly
Six Weeks.
The steamer Tartar, chartered by the
Government from the Canadian Pacific
Railroad, arrived in port late Saturday
night. She will be fitted out for a trans
port at the Government wharf and will
sail for Manila about the 20th inst. with
a regiment of regulars.
The Tartar was formerly on the run
between Southampton. England, and the
("ape of Good Hope, but when the Klon
dike boom was at its height the Canadian
Pacific people bought her for the Van
couver-Stickeen route. "When the bottom
fell out of the boom the railroad was left
with the steamer on their hands and noth
ing for her to do. She was then put upon
the Vancouver - Yokohama - Hongkong
route as an extra boat in the Empress
line, and made a number" of trips. When
the news was made public that I'ncle
Sam was very much in need of transports
to carry regulars to Manila and volun
teers home the Canadian Pacific sent an
agent to San Francisco, and aftor some
dickering succeeded in chartering the
Tartar to the Government. She was at
once sent to Nanaimo, B. C, to coal and
came down here in three days.
The Government will dispatch two
transports this weok. The Connemaugh
will get away this afternoon or to-morrow
with a lot of supplies for the army and a
deckload of cavalry horses. She will be
hurried back, as mounts for the cavalry
are urgently needed In the Philippines.
The City of Para will get away next
Thursday. Nearly all her freight is now
aboard, and Thursday morning the sol
diers assigned to her will go aboard. The
coffee season is now nearly over, so the
Mail Company can spare the vessel and in
consequence she will probably remain in
the Government service until all the vol
unteers have been brought home.
The Government officials and the people
generally have been looking for the trans
ports Ohio and Newport since Friday last.
The two steamers have the Second Ore
gon boys aboard, and the crowds who
want to welcome the soldiers have been
making the lives of the people in the Chief
Wharfinger's office miserable. About
every rive minutes the telephone bell rings
and when Chief Wharfinger Henderson
or Assistant Chief Wharfinger Dryden an
swers it the question almost invariably is,
"Have the transports with the Oregon
soldiers aboard been sighted yet?"
The chances are that both the Ohio and
Newport put into Nagasaki for coal, and
as The Call said before it will in conse
quence be to-morrow before they get in.
On their last voyage from Manila via
Nagasaki to San Francisco the Ohio was
twenty-eight and the Newport twenty
mi days making the run. To-morrow
both vcchcls will be twenty-eight days
out from Manila and until then they will
not be fully due. Of course if they did
not stop at Nagasaki they may pop in
at any moment From now on.
The Governor of Oregon does not ex
pect them before to-day. He will arrive
from Portland this morning and will ta-Ke
up his quarters at the Occidental Hotel.
Major Wilson, who recruited the regiment
In Oregon, is also here and he will go out
to meet the transports on the tug Gov
ernor lrwin with the Governor of Oregon,
Governor Gage and Mayor Phelan.
Everybody will know when the trans
ports are sighted, as the siren on tho
Eureka Planing Mills will blow for live
minutes without stopping. Again, when
the steamers are passing in through the
heads, the siren will take up her refrain
and will keep It up until the transports
have come to an anchor. The party on
the Governor lrwin â will then board tha
vessel that carries the headquarters of |
the regiment and welcome the boys back
In the names of Oregon and California.
The colliers Washtenaw and Progreso
had an interesting race down the coast. j
They left Puget Sound together and there |
was never more than a mile between them â¢
all the way down until the lightship was |
reached, when the Washtenaw made a j
spurt and beat the Progreso into port by !
about four miles. The Washtenaw came
from Tacoma and the Progreso from ;
Seattle. . , j
Wheat and barley are on the move and
in consequence several vessels have se- <
cured good charters. The Cypromene was ;
taken yesterday at 35s to load barley and
the Kenilworth and Ross-shire at 32s t:d .
to load wheat for England. The Hecla !
has been chartered' to load lumber on
Puget Sound for Australia.
H. Wood, an old man who keeps a cloth
ing store at 609 Clay street, was found al- !
most dead in bed from gas asphyxiation !
yesterday morning. He was hurried to
the Harbor Hospital, where Dr. Thomp- ;
son worked over him for quite a while :
and finally brought him back to life ;
again. The old man's sons pay it was
an attempt at sufcide, but the police seem
to think it was an accident. There have
been three deaths in the family of late !
and the old man has been very despond- j
ent. He was removed to the Lane Hos
pital during the afternoon.
About six weeks ago two men went out
to the North Farallon rocks (about eight
miles from the Farallon light) to poach :
sea fowl eggs. They landed on the rock
all right, but although two attempts have
since been made to take them off both j
have failed on account of the very rough â¢
weather. The men had enough provisions
to last them for some time and the eggs
would keep them from starving, but the
question is how could they exist without
water? Their supply must have given out
long ago and the chances are that they j
may have perished from thirst.
No one seems to know their names. I
They were both Telegraph Hill boyÂ» and. I
went out on the sloop Clara, Last week
the boat manned by Bob Spear and -Jack
Healy went out to the rock, but could
not get near enough to even hail the men.
It came on to blow and the men had to
run back to port. Another expedition
started out last night, and it is thought
that if th* men are still alive they will
be taken off and cared for.
PREPARING FOR APPEAL.
Pro Forma Judgment Sustaining the
Charter Entered by Judge
Seawell.
A pro forma judgment in favor of the
defendants in the action brought by Mar
tin Fragley against the Board of Election
Commissioners to test the validity of the ;
new charter was entered by Judge Sea- j
well yesterday morning. The judgmnt
waa entered upon an agreed statement of j
facts in order that a decision of the s>u- >
preme Court upon the issues involved ]
m Were b wÂ« .ome e argument preceding the ''
entering of judgment an the facts whteb
were to be included in the bill of excep
tions to the judgment, but finally it v-a*
agreed to enter all the facts which will
hereafter be found by the court *or the
purpose of the appeal. During tho heai
ing yesterday Deputy Registrar Rickarl
was put upon the stand to prove the U
uw)n which the proclamation for the
charter and the election of the Instru
ment were held. This over the agreement
stated was reached, and as soon as the
facts have been found the case will De
carried to the Supreme Court for de
cision.
Favors the Fire Department.
The Mission Business Men's Associa- ,
tion at a meeting held last night at Turn
Vereln Hall on Eighteenth street adopted
the following resolution regarding the
dollar limit and the Fire Department:
"Resolved, That the Mission Business j
Men's Association at a meeting held on
July 10, while appreciating the action of
the Supervisors in their desire to live up
to the ple-dge of keeping the taxes down ;
to the dollar limit, yet this association
deprecates what it terms a false economy â 
Of restricting the utility of the F'reDe
partment by shaving the appropriation to
*uch an extent as would cause with
drawal of several companies now in tlis
service; therefore be it
"Resolved, That we appeal to the 5U- i
pervlsora to make such an appropriation
as will permit the retention of all the
companies now In the department. rn<s
dissolution of any of the companies would ;
In the opinion of this association leave
the outside districts without amplÂ» pro- |
tection against fire and be the meeans of
subjecting property owners to double in- j
Burance rates."

CHILD TELLS THE STORY
OF HER FATHER'S MURDER
jPreliminary Examina
tion of Mrs. Kopp in
Conlan's Court.
THE story of the killintr of Charles
Kopp by his wife, Mrs. I/miisa
Kopp. nn the IMh of Jupe was told
In detail yesterday afternoon in
* Judge Conlan's court. Mrs. Kopp, pale
I and haggard-looking, dressed in black
* and wrapped in the folds of a long
!â¢" sealskin sarque. sat beside her attor
i" ney, ex-Judge Robert Ferral. A hack
r Ing couph told the secret of her ill
C health and shrunken frame. Phe was
â¢â¢ too overcome by prief to pay attention
!â¢ to the testimony offered for and
|" against her, and it was not until Mrs.
* Bertha Monti took the stand that the
accused ceased her violent sobbing and
Â£ listened with dry eyes to the testimony
|Â« of the woman whom her liusband pre
- ferrpd and who is supposed to have
* tif-en the direct cause of thi> Kopp fam
, ily trouble?.
TYif> testimony of Amanda Kopp. the
* 13-year-old daughter of the murdered
man and the woman who t^ok his life,
was convincing, more from the manner
in which the child gave it than for the
mere matter it conveyed. Little Aman
da never hesitated for a word. She
h:\>\ her facts well in hand, and her
tone more than her words showed the
sympathy she had for her sick mother
and the contempt she felt for the mur
dered father. T-ike one weighted with
she dwelt upon the lark of re
snect her dead father showed her

ferred his affections to Mrs. Bertha
M When the little witness referred to
"Mrs. Bertha Monti" her eyes flashed
and her quivering nostrils dilated: oth
erwise she was calm and collected dur
ing the recital. But little questioning
was necessary to bring out all the

concerning the killing. .ââ,_â nf

WINTERS MUST HANG,
SUPREME COURT SAYS
GUILTY OF THE MURDER OF AN- i
DREWS AT BADEN.
His Hope Had Been xhat the Supe
rior Court Had ErredâRe
view of the Crime.
The Supreme Court has decided by the
close margin of four to three that Harry
Winters must hang for the murder of
Charles A. Andrews.
on November LT, 1897, C. H. Raymond
and Winters entered the Grand Hotel at
Baden, a village south of this city, with
burglarious intent, and were interrupted
in their work by Andrews, a boarder;
both robbers fired at Andrews; several I
shots took effect, and Andrews died with- j
in an hour. Raymond was arrested the
same night, was found guilty of man
slaughter, and was sentenced to impris
onment for life at Folsom. Winters wa3
arrested Borne time afterward; a Jury
I him guilty of murder in the Bret
degree, and he whs sentenced to he
hanged. The trial proved that it was
Winters' bullets that killed Andrews,
h-'iioo the lighter sentence of Raymond.
Winters was* taken to Folsom to be exe
cuted but his attorneys secured a wilt
robable cause from the Supreme
I Court, pending appeal, which stayed the
tJ The defendant claimed that the court
! erred in its instructions for the prosecu
tion, in that tb/jy were injurious to the de
fense and that the refusal ol the court
to admit an Instruction asked for by the
â  '.nit relative to th( law oi alibi, the
defense of Winters, was highly prejudi-
C1 justice Garoutte wrote the prevailing
opinion of the court, hoi, imp: that no error
had been committed by the court. Thi3
i was concurred in by Justices Harrison,
1 McFarland and Van Dyke. This decision
i upholds the lower court in refusing to
1 admit the instruction of the defendant rel-
I ative to his claim of alibi, in that the
word "reasonable" did not precede the
! word "doubt." Jii^i*''' Henshaw differed
I from this conclusion, maintaining that the
court erred in its refusal, and that the ab
sence of the word "reasonable" was rot
of so great moment as to exclude â¢ the
I Instruction, in that the entire Instruc
tion should be construed together instead
of being segregated. In this opinion he
was upheld by Justice Templo and Chief
Justices Beattv.
In cases where the decision is as close
as this a petition for rehearing is always
filed and the defendant will ask for a re
opening. If no rehearing Is granted the
renal ttitur will go down to the lower court

she said, for T remained at the table.
"When we came out from dinner,
8h" continued, "papa was outside wait
ing for us. He walked home with us,
and when we came home mamma
begged him not to go with Mrs. Monti.
He laughed at mamma and told her he
loved Mrs. Monti and it was useless
for her to expect him to give her up.
Then I said to him: 'Papa, why do
you torment mamma so? She ls_ ill.
Why do you not console her? Then
he grabbed me by the throat, and after
a struggle I freed myself from him.
"After that mamma and he went into
the next room. I heard papa ask her
a card, and I saw her leave the
room to get it. I took up a book and
began to read, and the next thing l
knew was when I heard a pistol shot
and looked up. Papa was lying on the
floor and mamma had ,lust placed a
smoking hot pistol on the table.'
The child's testimony in part corrob
orated that of the arresting officers,
Collins and Shea, who took the woman
in charge after the murder.
Mrs Bertha Monti, in widow weeds,
mournfully jetty after a six months'
wearing, was the star witness oi the
afternoon Her testimony was mainly
noteworthy from the fact of her con
venient memory for forgetting things

APPEAL TO WINEGROWERS.
i Paris Commissioners Issue an Inter
esting Circular Relative to Ex
hibits at Paris.
The Paris Commissioners are Just now
bendrog their energies to waking up the
winegrowers of the State to the oppor
tunity that is offered to gain a worldwide
reputation at the Paris Exposition. To
this end they have issued a circular an
nouncing that sufficient space nas been
allotted to have California wines exhib
ited as they have never been before. The
circular specifies every requirement of the
Commissioners.
The exhibit is to be of commercial wloes
and information Is required as to whether
or not the wine Is made from one grape
or blended; whether sold under the vine
' yard's name; of the roil In which the
grape was grown; of irrigation, sun ex
posure, annual productlpn, etc. Those
facts should be sent to W. H. alcNeil at
the Occidental Hotel. Photographic port
folios are to be made containing photo
, graphs illustrating California methods of
winemaking. â¢
The Commissioners have rented a ware
house on Mission near Now Montgomery
street and the work of gathering in the
i xhlblts will be rapidly pushed from now
on. _

and her lark of understanding. The
witness found it difficult t" understand
what was meant by "improper rela
tior.s existing between man and
woman." and the phrase had to be ex
plained in detail to her. Even then th
question, "Were the relations existing
between you and Kopp Improper?"
brought forth the qualified response.
"If you ''insider going to the Cliff
House with a man improper. T suppose
they were: otherwise they were not."
Mrs. Monti denied that Kopp was in
love with her, and also that she knew
that Mrs. Kopp was jealous of her.
She told how Mrs. Kopp had railed
upon her, and although it was the first
call she had ever paid her she re
mained from 9 o'clock in the evening
until 1 in the morning reciting to her
her marital woes. She said:
"Mrs. Kopp's principal grievance
seemed to be that Kopp would not deed
back to her the property she had given
),,m previous to her departure for the
Bast. 'If he doesn't deed it back to
me,' she told me, "he will not live to
enjoy It.' "
Mrs. Monti's cross-examination
brought out the fact that during Mrs.
Kopp's absence in the East she (Mrs.
Monti) had rented apartments in the
Kopp residence, on Lewis street; that
Bhe and Kopp occupied adjoining
apartments and that they took their
meals together In the kitchen of the
residence.
"Just like man and wife?" questioned
Judge Ferral.
"No," said Mrs. Monti. "Mr. Kopp
did the cooking."
Fred Jacobson, a neighbor of the
Kopps. told of frequent quarrels in the
Kopp household, and how he had fre
quently seen Kopp and Mrs. Monti to
gether in the Kopp kitchen during Mrs.
Kopp's absence in the Kast.
Mrs. Johannab Le Contl. another
neighbor, testified that Mrs. Kopp had
told her she was anxious to get the
property back that she had deeded to
her husband before her departure for
the East, and that she feared he would
give ii to the Monti woman.
The ense will be continued thiÂ«Â» morn
ing at 11 o'clock, when Mrs. Kopp will
take the stand In her own behalf.
CABRERA MAINTAINS
HIMSELF BY FORCE
GUATEMALAN DICTATOR BOTH
HATED AND FEARED.
An American Banker Exiled for Re
fusing 1 to Loan Money â Political
Prisoners Shot by Guards.
Mall advices from Guatemala confirm
the reports of an approaching crisis in
the Central American republic. That the
dissatisfaction will lead to a revolution
against the administration of President
Cabrera scorns hardly likely in view of
the fact that there is no money in the j
country to organize anything 1 approaching ;
a formidable insurrection. Uprisings In j
the cities are, however, expected, and
while they may not result In Cabrera's
downfall they will cause great loss to in
vested capital.
It is by no means unlikely that foreign
g-overnments. especially the Vnited States
and Germany and possibly Knglsuid, may
be called upon to interfere, if they have
not been requested to do so already.
f'abrera appears to be maintaining' him
self In office purely and simply by force.
Numerous tales of political- prisoners be
ing shot to death by their guards acting
under his orders are being circulated.
Among those said to have been murdered
in this manner by order of the dictator
are the following: Colonel Mateo Paz and
his brother Vincente, shot down while be
inp taken- to prison at Zacapa; Jose Ma
Ãbizo, assassinated by his guards on the
way to Chato: Don Hcrachio Trejo, in
San Marcos; Hoh Guadenrio Morales. In
! the Rancho Pan Augustin; Don Adrian
] Victoria, in Tecuhitan: Don Filadelfo
Pais, in Costa Cuca, and many others
whose names are unkown.
Five thousand refugees in Salvador and
as many more in Mexico and Honduras
are ready to take up arms against Ca
brera. The creat majority of the people !
of Guatemala detest him and would like
to see him deposed, but they also fear
him. The seriousness of the situation lies
in the fact that there is no money In the
country, and it is believed that a revo
lution, even if unsuccessful, would result
in hopeless national bankruptcy.
His Spite Costs Him Six Months.
James Johnson, who smashed two plate
glass windows in a store at 121 Montgom
ery avenue through spite because he had
been discharged by the company in which
the windows were insured, appeared for
sentence before Judge Conlan yesterday.
The Judge gave him six months in the
County Jail.
LORD AND LADY

genial Role.
SOCIETY WENT AND SMILED

AT THE ALCAZAR.
"Carmen" at the Grand, "Mignon" at

mer at the Orpheum.
Notes.
Society reserved its best showing for
"Lord and Lady Algy" and turned out
liberally in numbers and brilliantly in
costume at the Columbia Theater last
evening. Society on this occasion seemed
to know intuitively a gocxi thing before
seeing it. for "Lord and Lady Algy" is
not only a good thing In the way of
modern comedy, bnt it is one of the best
of the good things in that line that have
coma to Sun Francisco.
As the piece was presented at the
Columbia last night it was elaborately
staged and superbly 'costumed, the gowns
of the ladies In the fancy dress ball in the
second act being a shimmering dream of
beautiful fabrics. These scenic elabora
tions were the. framework for clever dia
logue, and funny situations that arose
naturally and glided into place without
effort. The act comes to an almost pa
thetic climax, when, after I^ord Alger
non, tipsy and almost maudlin, is or
dered out of the house by Brabazon Tud
way, Lady Algernon places her arms
about him and lovingly escorts him from
the room, loyal enough and womanly
enough not to desert, her husband in his
disgrace. , .
There was the stillness of intense mter
est in the crowded house as the curtain
rolled down upon the tableau, and then
the audience forgot its dignified reserve
and applauded again and again.
Henry Miller has a role that fits him.
He acts it with a naturalness and repres
sion as delightful as novel. The tipsy
scene, the most trying and risky of all.
because one so easily overdone, was i
played just to the limit and not a hair
breadth beyond.
Margaret Anglln's portrayal of the
good-hearted and volatile Lady Algernon
was artistic. H.-r naturalness and spon
taneity were refreshing. C. I>eslie Aliens
1-traba'znn Tudway was a good make up
for a caricature of Senator Mark Hanna

the spots Th<-r<> he seemed to forget nis
earnestness and his Jealousy and wan

land of burlesque. .

hit of the seasonâ and of a very good sea

Alcazar.
â â To the health "f Camille." So say
the guests at table in the early scenes
and so say the theater-going public. May
the masterpiece of Dumas tils forever
nourish despite the philosophers who tell
us we must laugh to be happy. 'Tis tears
we ;Â«m to want, and In â â¢Camille we
shed them in plenty. 'Tis said that
Dumas pere, reading the early acts, be
came irore and more fearful lest senti
ment should, in the end. wreck a great
play and when he found that death was
the chosen climax he gathered his son
triumphantly to his breast and called
I a true child of his father. A very
pie of broken hearts is the play, and
night, when Monsieur Duval was
,g his duty as he saw It and stealing
the sunshine from Camille s life, the
f . bird sang merrily In its cage on the
sta.ee as little birds do In the trees when
hearts in the world below are breaking.
H^re Miss Roberts does her great work.
The tenderness, the pathos, the infinite
sadness of. the scene work so upon the
Imotionc that even the stoutest heart
overheats and tears spring to eyes where
they have long been strangers. All of her
work l- beautiful, and in future when we
r P Jak Of our great CamUles, let us put
her name high upon the list. Of Mr
Whittlesey's Armand I cannot say too
much Lwas noi surprised at its strength
but I 'think the public was. In the fourth
act iiis work was greeted with a perfect
storm of applause and four curtain calls
showed him his artistic work had not
been in vain. It is unquestionabjy a sre^t
Xw< '.'tTe'd'i'f a piece of work in the third

capable of roles she has never been trust
ed with" 1 think she is. A dainty piece
Âf mosaic was tli.' Nannie of Miss
krmsby and Mr. Platfs Gaston was the
best thing we have seen him do. Mr.
Montaine's Monsieur Duval is not a good
niece of work. It savors too much in tone
of the minister, and becomes monotonous.
Miss Howe does very good work as Pru
bul dresses she part more outland
'than is necessary. It offends the
eye too much. The other roles were well
susl uned by the Alcazar Stock c.om
nany In conclusion, it may not be amiss
to say that when an audience sees lit to
laueh in a pathetic scene at a trifling
state accident we ar.e reminded that
Goethe in his wisdom, has said: There
is nothing in which people more betray
their character than in what they find to
laugh at " "Camille" will no doubt play

Grand Opera-House.
The production of "Carmen" at the
Grand Opera-house last night proved a
most agreeable surprise to the large audi
ence. If any doubts existed as to the ca
pability of the clever company to give a
creditable performance of the opera they
were quickly dispelled and the audience
showed their appreciation by liberal ap
nlause and curtain calls. Hattie Belle
Ladd in the title role scored a pronounced
Buccess She was the daredevil coquette
to the life and charmed her admirers.
Fdith Ma=on as Michaela shared the hon
ors with her and sang with her usual
facility and sweetness. Thomas H.

To-night the Lambardi Grand Italian

That San Francisco has neglected the

That it regretH it there is also no ques
tion It has been announced that the
company will be reorganized, however,
and under the management of S. 11.

An excellent programme is offered the
theater-goint; public by the Orpheum
i management this week. Miss Minnie
Palmer made a d. Tided hit with her clever
play. "Rose Pompom." In her rendition
of her varied part she displayed old-time
ability. As the nun Miss Palmer is a bit
i tno tragic, but when she discards the
vestments of her religious calling and as
| BUmes the part of Rose Pompom, the gay
soubrette, she is in her element, singing
! and dancing in true music hall style. The
i Rixfords do some wonderful head bal
i ancing. and disrobing while in that awk
ward position. George Wilson* mono
logue is extremely funny. His laughing
pong and jokes are extra good. Millian
and Shields, the "tragic comedians," do
a turn that is decidedly ridiculous. Hayes
and Lytton are still favorites In the farce,
