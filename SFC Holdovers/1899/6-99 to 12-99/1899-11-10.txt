MRS. HAZEN BECOMES THE
BRIDE OF ADMIRAL DEWEY
After a Simple Wedding Ceremony at Washing
ton the Happy Couple Journey to New
York, Attracting Much Attention.
WASHINGTON, Nov. <> -Admiral
â¢â¢â  Dewey and Mrs. Mil
dred Hazen were married
quietly at the rectory of St.
Paul's Catholic Church In V
ir Fifteenth, this city.
shortly before 10 o'clock this morning,
mony was performed by Rev.
James F. Mackin, pastor of the church,
assisted by the Rev. Joseph H. Fole as
sistant pastor, and the Rev. Sidney Hurl
but.. The ceremony was of the simplest
character, according to the rites of the
Catholic church, and the only witnesses
besides the officiating clergymen were,
Mrs. 'Washington McLean and Mrs. Lud
low, wife of Admiral Ludlow, mother and
pistÂ£r respectively, of the bride, and Lieu
tenant Caldwell, Admiral Dew< secre
tary.
The. arrangements for the wedding were
made with all the secrecy which has at
tended the whole affair. After procuring
the license for the wedding yesterday,
Lieutenant Caldwell , lied on Father
Mackin of St. Paul's, of which- church
Mrs. Haze;] is a communicant., and ar
ranged for t-he. wedding this morning. As
Admiral Dewey is not a Catholic a spe
cial.dispensation was required for the per
formance of the ceremony, and this was
procured by Father Mackin from Bishop
Curtisj vicar-general .of the diocese of
Baltimore, who granted it in the absence
of Cardinal Gibbons, who is at present in
New .Orleans. Father Mackin went to
Baltimore for this purpose yesterday
afternoon.
At 9:45 this morning two carriages con
taining the wedding party drew up before
the modest red brick rectory In the rear |
of St. Paul's. The general public ad no
Intimation of where the ceremony was to
take place, and not a single spectator was j
present as the party alighted. Admiral
Dewey and Lieutenant Caldwell quickly
stepped from their carriages and the ad
miral assisted the bride-elect and her
mother and sister from the other car- j
riage. Mrs. Hazen was gowned in a
pearl-gray silk, over which she wore a
loiig stylish black wrap trimmed with bll
ver.fox and lined with lavendar silk. The
admiral wore a black frock coat, gray
trousers and a silk hat. Upon entering
the rectory they were ushered into the
reception room, where Admiral Dewey
was presented to Father Mackln and th"
two clergymen who were to assist in the
ceremony.
Upon being presented to Father Macktn,
the admiral said that he had heard that
Father Mackin had in his early years
been a sailor, and It gave him additional
happiness to know that' he was going to
be married by a clergyman who had at
one time followed the sea. Father
Mack replied happily that when he j
found he could not become an admiral he
determined to become a priest. Mrs. Ha
zen removed her wrap, and she and the
admiral Immediately took their places in
the center of the little reception room,
where -the ceremony was performed which
made them man and wife. Father Mackin
and his assistants wore simple black cas
socks. Before the ceremony Father
Mackln addressed the contracting parties
as follows:
"Before pronouncing the solemn words
which will bind you forever together, it
may be' well to forget for a moment the <
things that are around us and to look
upward. We are the children of God and
we have a right to call upon Him In joy |
and in sorrow. We need his help in both ;
extremes, and never more than now, for,
although the promises you are about to :
make are easily made and tie work of a
moment, their fulfillment Is '.he work of ;
a lifetime. We call upon God to witness I
and to bless this union, of which He is
the author and which He made sa- j
cred. No matter how gencrou* and de
voted you may be to each other, there
are in every life momenta of trkl, when
we In our weakness need the hrlp that
comes from above, and this helmwlll be
given In its fullness in return tor the
faithful fulfillment of our obligations.
The higher your positions In life tin more
Incumbent upon you is the faithful ful
fillment of your obligations and the more
rigorous the accounts that will !,Â« ex
acted The neglect of these obligations
will cast Its shadow upon eternity. J'.ut
this hour, we hope, marks the beginning
of a career which will make' you wiser,
better and more useful to your fellW
natures In this life and the life beyord,
and when death at last shall break tie
link which binds you, as death alone cauj
The San Francisco Call.
1 break it. may that last hour find two j
,- as fondly clasped and two hearts
ns closely joined as they are to-day, and .
may the joys of this life be a foretaste of
the ji>.\ s that are to come."
Thi ceremony \\.-is performed with the
rinÂ£. according to the nuptial rites nf tin-
Catholic church, [ncluding the address of
Father Ma. kin. it consumed less than five
i minutes. Father Maokin was the liist to
! hail the l>ridÂ«- as Mrs. Dewey. Congratu
lations and felicitations followed, and the ;
ling party drove directly from the'
rectory to the residence of the bride's
mother. Mrs. McLean, where a wedding
bn akfaat was Berved.
After arriving at Mrs. McLean's resl
â  Admiral Dewey was driven to his
own bouse. There he changed his trav
*u)t, returning to the McLean
â  'in fooj. The wedding breakfast
â¢â¢ i an hour. There were present only
ride and groom, Mis. McLean, Mrs.
if, Lieutenant Caldwell and Fred
Bugher. The table was elaborately dec
: with bride roses.
About 1:20 Admiral and Mrs. Dewey left
th< McLean residence for the Pennsyl
a depot. Mrs. Dewey had changed
the gown in Which she was married for
ii k traveling suit. Less than a dozen
le had congregated at the depot, and
was no demonstration as they
d hurriedly through the station to
the train. Secretary Hoot boarded the
train Just before it pulled out and offered
his congratulations in person.
Admiral and Mrs. Dewey left at 12:45
fur New fork.
NEW EORK, Nov. P.â Admiral and Mrs.
Dewey arrived In New York to-night from
Washington. They were driven direct
from the West Twenty-third street ferry
to the Waldorf-Astoria, where they are
; the guests of Mr. Boldt, the proprietor of
that hotel. The admiral and his bride did
not register.
Admiral Dewey and Mrs. Dewey will
probably spend a day or two at the Wal
; dorf. The admiral and his wife reached
the West Twenty-third street ferry at
6:30 p. n.. They were driven directly to
the Waldorf, where they spent the even-
Ing. They did not leave the hotel during
the evening.
Admiral and Mrs. Dewey got away from
Washington without attracting any at
tention. They came to New York in an
ordinary "hair ear. Passengers who came
over. Secretary Root among them, said
I that the adir.lrnl and his bride were not
generally! recognized by the other p
gers unt'l after Philadelphia had been
passed. Then there was a general desire
on the part of everybody on the train to
Bee them. People bought chair car tickets
! for the purpose of being In the same car,
and others who did not get chairs walked
through the car for the purpose of seeing
the !>ride and groom.
At the suggestion of one of the passen
gers a collection was taken up in the
Other cars to buy some (lowers to present
to the couple, but a conference with the
ednductor showed them that no flowers
could be obtained until Jersey <'ity was
reached, and the project was abandoned
and the money refunded.
A gToup of the passengers got around
the admiral, however, when he left his
seat for a few moments near Elizabeth.
and a silk handkerchief with an American
flag embroidered on it and a handful of
cigars were presented to him. Hu. ac
cepted them in a good-natured way. One
old man grasped his hand and said to
him: "Admiral, I saw you oa tliÂ© Olyja,
SAN FRANCISCO, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 10, 1899.
pia and In the parade. I want to say to
you, may the Lord bless you."
The admiral saw the man's kind feelings
an.) was visibly affected. He said:
"That's good. I tliank you. I'll go and
tell my wife."
Shortly before Jersey City was reached
Secretary !;i">t. who had Intentionally
avoided the bride and groom duriner the
t rip. knowing" that they would appreciate
biiiiK together, went over and spoke to
them.
There was a considerable crowd in the
! Jersey City station when the train rolled
In, waiting to see the admiral and Mrs
Dewey. The boats were coming over with
commuters and there were more people
outside the fence that separated the train
shed from the general waiting-room. As
the train stopped the admiral rose from
his seat and started with Mrs. I)ewey out
of the car. The crowd was waiting for
them down on the platform and as he
stepped down from the ear he was
I cheered. The men in the crowd all doffed
i their hots and the admiral lifted his. As
he walked down the platform additional
cheers and additional greetings were
given. The admiral looked the brlde
, groom. His (ucp. was Hushed and he
smiled bark at the crowd nnd answered
their greetings by lifting his hat again
; and again. Mrs. Dewey also bowed and
| smiled.
The station master escorted the couple
from the train to the Twenty-third street
ferryboat. The crowd gave a final cheer
as the admiral and his wife went down
the gangplank to the upper deck of the
ferryboat and .many of them rushed
aboard for a moment to get a better look
at them. The admiral took Mrs. Dewey
around the deck, outside the big cabin
and stood with her out In front of the
pilot-house, .hoping to be alone. The
crowd of passengers followed. They
gathered in a semi-circle about the newly
wedded couple and at times cheered the
admiral and his wife.
A newspaper man apologized for intitul
ing and remarked that this wÂ«i3 an em
barrassing situation. To this the admiral
assented. He Bald that he would rather
be excused, under the circumstances,,
from telling what his plans for the honey
moon were. After Jive minutes in this
semi-circle of curious people the admiral
and Mrs. Dewey walked into the cabin,
which was almost, empty, and sat to
gether do-wn on one side of the benches,
away back in the stern of the boat. They
wire alone only a few moments, however.
Then one by one persons began to wal.t
aiound the cabin and to take seats op
posite. In five minutes all the seats were
crowded. The admiral appeared slightly
â embarrassed, but he talked on uncon
cernedly to Mrs. Dewey, trying, evidently,
to appear unconscious of the curiosity of
the other passengers. He took it all
good-naturedly.
When the boat reached the Twenty
third street ferry-house the crowd hurried
out to the street in front to see the dis
tinguished passengers walk to their car
riage and to give them another cheer. A
big policeman, learning who was coming,
opened a wide pathway through the
crowd. â¢
The admiral did not come out the way
the crowd expected, however. Apparently
he did not attempt to evade the curious.
He simply went down with Mrs. Dewey

CONTEST IS
CERTAIN IN
KENTUCKY
Victory Claimed by Both
Republican and Demo
cratic Candidates.
CHARGES OF FRAUD
Legislate Which Would Settle
the Dispute Is Believed to Ec
Strongly Democratic
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MIDDLESBORO, Nov. 9. â For
two hours to-day there was in
tense excitement here, caused by a
clash between the Ball and Turner
factions. The Balls nre Democrats,
but espoused the cause of Taylor
for Governor. Charles Pridmore. a
Turner follower, and C. D. Ball
met and began ahootlng at eai b
other. Their friend* assembled and
surrounded them. A long-range
street fight took place, in which
fifty shots were exchanged. The
factions have been at war for many
months, mid it is feared then- will
be trouble when the vote is can
vassed. Lee Turner returned to-the
outskirts of the town with a large
body of men, but as yet no demon
strations have been made.
LOriSYILT.E, Ky.. Nov. 9.â A con
fusion of claims and counter-claims
to quiet which the official count or
perhaps a contest before the Leg
islature will be necessarj is all that
is left of Tuesday's election. Above it all
vehement cries of fraud, committed or
contemplated, are heard. Bach side claims
the election of its ticket by a plurality of
ahout MOO and presents figures to back up
the ciaim. These figures in some counties
; vary widely, and It is Impossible to tell
which side, if cither, has accurate returns.
Chairman Long of the Republican cam
paign committee, when asked for an es
timate of the vote on the Gubernatorial
race, said:
"I have no estimate to give, but I can
â¢â  furnish the actual figures. On the face of
I the returns Taylor's plurality is 4136. All
the precincts have been heard from.
Twelve counties are not official, including
the returns from Kenton and Breathitt."
General Taylor said he was sure of hia
eelction by a majority that will not be
less than 4000. General Taylor said that
i official and semi-official returns from
nearly every precinct In the State showed
| that he had been elected.
A special from Frankfort quotes Gover
' nor Bradley as saying: "Taylor has been
elected by at hast 10,000 majority and he
will he the next Governor of Kentucky."
On the other hand, returns from Demo
cratic sources show a plurality on the
face of the returns of about 2000 for
Goebel. This they claim is to be effected
by returns from some missing precincts,
where the Democrats can hardly do worse
than break even. Mr. Goebel and Sena
tor Blackburn in interviews at Frankfort
to-day openly charged the Republicans
with fraud in the Eleventh District, from
| which the returns are coming in very
slowly.
The indications point more strongly than
ever to a contest before the Legislature,
which, there seems no reasonable doubt!
will be controlled by the Democrats.
Whether or not the members belonging to
that party will stand together on Ques
tions affecting a contest cannot now be
foretold. The county boards of canvass
ers, which meet to-morrow, simply count
and tabulate the returns. The State Board
of Election Commissioners then reviews
the work and decides all questions affect
ing contested ballots. This commission
certifies to the Secretary of State the elec
tion of officers receiving the highest num
ber of votes after the decisions of the
commissioners on contested election re
turns have been recorded. Under the
Goebel law the duties of the Secretary of

BULLER'S FIRST TASK
IS TO RESCUE WHITE
Failure to Receive Reports Concerning Fight
ing in Vicinity of Ladysmith Causes a
Most Gloomy Feeling in London,
This picturesque headland stands on the southern side of the entrance to the harbor of Port Natal. Its crest is 271
feet above the water, and on it stands an iron lighthouse eighty-one feet high whose light is visible for twenty-eight
miles. There are on it also two strong batteries of modern garrison guns. The British cruiser Terrible, with a
strong naval contingent, intended for defense against the Boers, is now due at Port Natal, where her sister ship, the
Powerful, and other war vessels already lie.
LONDON, Nov. 10.â Thje Cape Town correspondent of the Standard
says: Trje Ministerial papers h;ere are giving currency to infamous
charges of British) cruelty to prisoners and the treacherous use of tr;e
white fiag. It is asserted that thje British have bound prisoners to the
wheels of Maxiro guns and dragged trjem along.
fit Constantinople it is ruroored that Lord Cromer, British diplo
matic agent in Egypt, Y)os received instructions to arrange witb the
Egyptian Cabinet for tr;e dispatch of 5000 Egyptian troops to the Trans
vaal, but the report is discredited rjere.
LONDON, Nov. 10, 4:30 a.' m.â
scanty and conflicting news from
the seat of war and the fact that
General White has not yet said a
word about the alleged fighting
around Ladysmlth are again producing a
feeling of gloom. It may be that General
; White has Bent news and that General
; Buller has thought best to keep it to him
! self. Indeed, this is the version that is
beginning to be believed, as it is held to
ihe impossible that the news of heavy
, fighting brought by Kaffirs in such cir
i cumstantial detail cannot be wholly
; groundless. If this be so, it is ominous,
! for there could be no ground for conceal
; ing favorable news.
The Boers, if they ever entertained the
Idea of .'i real Invasion of Cape Colony,
have probably now abandoned it and will
devote their whole energies to reducing
Lady smith. Th< y have only about a week
to do this. The fart that they are rather
inactive indicates that they are waiting
for something which they feel sure will
justify their delay. The latest Estcourt
dispatches seem to hint that the parrison
| is nhout to retire further southward.
The first transport, the Roslin Castle,
carrying reinforcements, has arrived at
Tape Town and has hern ordered to pro
coed immediately to Durban. Other trnns
i ports are expected to arrive in the course
of a few days and will he directed to
proceed to the same port. This dispatch
of troops direct to Natal will evidently
interfere with General Buller's original
plan of campaign. At least one division
will he needed to extricate General White.
Tf the emergency is extreme the troops
can be sent up piecemeal from Durban
to the front as they come in but if there
' is no need for haste a whole division will
' probably he assembled hefore the for
ward movement takes place.
It seems clear that the first operation
of General Buller will he to set free Gen
eral White. The position of T,adysmith is
not critical, hnt it Is dangerous, from the
fact that the Boers are evidently bring
ing up numerous heavy puns from Johan
nesburg and without many heavy pieces
to reply to them General White is likely
tn find himself in difficulties, hut if a
column of 8000 or !W>o men can he swiftly
sent up from Durban the Boers In Natal
may he hadly defeated and these great
guns captured.
An official dispatch issued at the War
Oftice says that a slight bombardment of
' Kimberley has commenced. This is the
tirst notification that such a step is
taking place. The general in command
gives no details. The Boer force outside
<>f Kimberley does not exceed 6000 i and
they have never shown any special ag
gressiveness.
Orders have been received at Woolwich
and Devenport for the mohilization of a
siege train, which, it is supposed, is in
tended for the purpose of shelling Pre
toria. The force manning it will approxi
mate to the strength of eip:ht batteries.
Its armament will be thirty howitzers,
fourteen 6-inch guns, eight 5-inch puns
and eight 4-lneh Runs, the whole train
weighing more than 3000 tons. This will
be the first employment of a modernized
siege train by any European army, and
the progress of the reduction of the forts
by lyddite shell fire, a preliminary to
storming by infantry, will be watched
with interest and curiosity by all profes
sional soldiers.
Three large steamers have just been
chartered at Liverpool to convoy the
10,000 troops of the divisions which Lord
W"olseley yesterday announced would be
mobilized.
STALE REPORTS FROM
THE SCENE. OF BATTLE
LONDON, Nov. 9.â The Colonial Office
has received a telegram from the Gov
ernor of Natal giving a copy of tlio
pigeon post message received oy the
Premier from the commandant of volun
teers. It is as follows:
"LADYSMITiL Tuesday. Nov. .'.âl sent
THE BLUFF AT PORT NATAL
yi in November 3, by native mesF^nger, a
report of the engagement that day, but
I am not sure if it reached you, as the
messenger has not returned. Major
Taunter ai d Serg< >nt Mapsone of the
Natal Carbineers were killed. Captain
! of the Border Mounted Rifles was
wounded. Nine were wounded, il slight
ly, and are doing well. There has been.
nothing important since. The hospital
was removed to a spot on the railway
three miles south. All was quiet on San
day and Monday. The enemy renewed
the bombardment to-day, but no damage
has been done."
The War Office has received th> follow
ing dispatch from General Buller, dated
tap.. Town, Wednesday, November S,
11:50 p. in. :
"Colonel Kekewlch telegraphs from
Kimberley, November 8, that all is well
there, and there hag been no serious at
tack as yet A Blight bombardTiem did
no damage. Information from Alafeking
shows that place was safe October 27.
Colonel Plumer hail a successful engage
ment near Fort Tuli October 27.
"General White reports by pigeon post
that the wounded and some civilians
from Ladysmith have been removed four
miles down the railway by an arrange
ment with Coloinl Joubert to a neutral
vine, to save them from the bombard
ment. Ninety-nine wounded from Dun
dee have been sent in under tlag of truce.
They are all doing well, including t-e fol

Boultbee, Captain Dibley, Lieutenant c.
N. I. run, Lieutenant, C. A. Wortham,
Major W. Davidson and Lieutenant D.
E. Welder. The bombardment was dis
continued November 4 and B, and it Is
expected to recommence November 6."
SAYS LADYSMITH IS
SAFE FOR SOME TIME
LONDON, Nov. 10.â The Telegraph has
received the following from its corre
spondent at Pietennaritzburg:
"I have some hesitation in accepting the
rumors of heavy fighting near Ladysmith.
The Boers are evidently trying to effect a
lodgment around the place whence they
can shell the town and camps, but General
White's batteries are able to prevent them
from closing in too near. Owing to the
fact that Ladysmith lies and the
Boers have unluckily been' permitted to
occupy Mount Bulwan and other of the
surrounding big hills, attempts to open
up heliographic communication have
â 'â  a failure.
"As regards Estcourt and Pietermaritz
burg. they are safe. So is Ladysmith for
a long time to come. Two white men,
Messrs. Barnard and Hoenkins, who, ow
ing to their knowledge of the district,
were able to escape from Ladysmith Sun
day night, arrived at Estcourt to-day,
having traveled by way of Frere. They
rode west, following the Kaffir paths.
They report that tho Boers have guns
north, east and west of the town, namely,
on Signal Hill, Mount Bulwan and lvp
worth Hill. Beyond killing a few Kaffirs
and coolies their shells have done little
damage.
"General White, they say, wrote to
General Joubert, asking permission to
send away the non-combatants. The Boer
leader's reply was that the women and
children would be received under tho guns
at Mount Bulwan. All others in the place
and the town guard would be prisoners of
war. A meeting of the townspeople was
held, under the presidency of the Mayor,
and declined to accept these terms. The
audience enthusiastically sang the na
tional anthem."

which carried two companies of the
Dublin Fusileers ilnder Captain Romero,
sighted r.ear Colenso the Boers in con
siderable r "orce near the line, '."he Fusi
leers immediately opened a brisk fire, to
which the Boers replied ineffectively, and
as they were suffering loss, they quickly
retired out of sight. But as the train
cautiously advanced, the Boers were
seen moving round on its left flank, their
presumed object being to take the train
in the rear. To avoid this the train re
tired. It was seen that the Boers had
no Intention of attacking, but were in full
retreat over the road and bridge. Im
mediately r. strong detachment left the
train and entered the town, while the
train slowly advanced to the station.
Several volleys at long range were fired
on the retreating enemy. The British
also succeeded in entering Fort Wylie,
near Colenso, and brought back four
wagonloads of shells, provisions and
stores.
BOTH SIDES SUFFER
SOME HEAVY LOSSES
ESTCOT'RT, Nov. fi.â Fighting is pro
j ceeding daily. On Friday three separate
j engagements took place. The main at
tack was on the Boer batteries at -iula
| wana Hill. The British casualties were
about l&J men in killed and wounded, but
accumulating reports show that the
enemy suffered far heavier loss -.
COURAGE IS ADMIRED.
TAPE TOWN*. Monday, Nov. 6.â There
is no doubt that the feeling prevalent of
admiration for the courage of the Boers
during the recent fighting is a good au
gury for a future peaceful settlement of
the existing trouble. The Boer prisoners
on the British cruiser Penelope pay high
tribute to the British artillery.
Reports from Kimberley seem to Indi
cate that the investing force has been
greatly -weakened for the purpose of send
ing detachments to the eastern and south
ern borders. The threatened widespread
Boer invasion of Cape Colony has not ma
terialized. Doubtless the swollen river
and the possibility of their retreat being
cut off has had some effect.
The work of laying a new cable to St.
Helena will be commenced Tuesday. ,
BRIDGE BLOWN UP.
BURGHERSDORP, Cape Colony, Nov.
There are no signs here of the Boers,
though it Is asserted that they will in
vade Burghersdorp to-morrow morning.
It is said that a large Boer force has
traversed Jamestown, going in the di
rection of Queenstown. Their signals
were plainly visible at night. The police
have returned and reoccupied Storm
burg and Nauuwpoort. The Boers have
blown up the Achterlang railroad bridge
and have cut the wires.
DISABLED TRANSPORT.

her thrust shaft broken and other
damage done. She was picked up by a
tup close to some rocks and was towed

CITIZENS ORGANIZE
TO PREVENT FRAUDS
LEXINGTON, Ky., Nov. -Twelve
hundred citizens of all parties met at the
opera-house to-nighi to devise methods to
prevent alleged election frauds. Judges
George Denny and R. A. Thornton made
addresses counseling force if necessary to
prevent it. Colonel W. C. P. Breckinridge
and J. C. Bronston were more temperate.
The former pointed out how Bradley may,
under the constitution, continue Governor
until his successor is qualified or until the
Federal court settles the question. One
thousand dollars was contributed to
prosecute aHeged frauds in this county.

GENERAL OTIS UNDISTURBED BY
THE RAIN OF CAUSTIC COMMENTS
Side Lights on "the Rings" and "the Bosses"

Philippines.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
MANILA, P. 1.. Sept. 20.â The equa
nimity of his excellency, the mili
tary governor, General Otis, has
been undisturbed by the moun
tains of reproach and piles* of
odium that have been heaped upon his
devoted head bj the hosts >>f volunteers
and press correspondents that have either
returned to the United States or remain
in these Islands. And as the administra
tion, it seems, Is determined to retain
him in his post, why, Indeed, should such
trivial matters annoy him? The publi
cation of cables from Washington an
nouncing the "full confidence <>f the Presi
dent" was a feature of the las; week,
hut then the local sheets are obliged to
print all fulsome news, and none of a
<:â¢ rogatorj t> p<-.
The charges that have boon made, not
only by volunteers, hut also by cor
respondents, "that our troops have shot
down and killed in cold blood the poor in
nocent Filipino" are a pack of lies. The
truth is that these scoundrels have been
treated too well and far too leniently by
the American authorities. In fact. Otis
and his officers Beem to have l"-e;i afraid
of the criticisms that might have devel
oped into charges of cruelty on the part
of some missionary and other organiza
tions, who have the "welfare" of the
poor nip^t-r at heart. Your Fj
knows ii" such a thins a? kindness, and
the trite saying hem "that fur every
Filipino lorn a rattan is created" is an
axiom that is true and appropriate.
The Filipinos are cruel, treacherous
and unreliable and only kept in order md

â¢ .if justice and firmness. Although,
as I have s; Id, General Otis has been the
â  â¢ of every species <>f criticism and

position with the authorities to impress
their countrymen with. the idea that Gen
eral Otis will (Jo anything they counsel
and to which they give their approbation.
The principal person recommended by the |
individual mentioned is a doctor nameo.
Pardo de Tavera, a fellow whoso past
career is known to every respectable for
eign resident in Manila, none of whom
are willing to trust him beyond ken. An
other of these counselors is the proprietor
of large distilleries here and an ex-mem
ber of Aguinaldo's Cabinet, who saw that
to pretend to sympathize with the Ameri
cans was the best way to remain in Ma
nila and sneak into favor with the powers
that be to obtain news that might be
useful to his countrymen, at the same
time keeping himself from harm. His
name is Hector Legarda, and his con
stant companion in daily drives is Com
missioner Worcester, whose sole aim is to
establish municipal governments and ap
point the respective Mayors, who after a
while are invariably found to be colonels
in the insurgent army.
Dally the Filipinos appointed to posts as
Mayors and head men in the villages
where Commissioner Worcester has ,made
his rounds are reported, after hiving
taken the oath of allegiance to the United
States, to be insurgent officers or in sym
pathy with the cause. And still this- man
Worcester is vain enough to imagine that
through his efforts the future regenera
tion of the Filipino race is to be accom
plished. His constant companion, as men
tioned, is Hector Legarda, and there is a
shrewd suspicion afloat that the "Mayor"
appointments are made by Worcester
upon I/egarda's recommendation. ,:%â ..
Just what qualifications Worcester. had
that caused the administration to appoint
him as Commissioner must be a secret to
all in the Philippines, for beyond his
career as a bug and bird hunter and his
launch into literature his ability to grasp
such important questions as have . pre
sente.d themselves at this juncture are
very limited. But then there is a deal in
looking wise and saying little. Consen
sus of opinion, if freely "expressed in the
army and navy and among civilians', who
from iong residence among these islands
are entitled to have. knowledge of affairs,
is that the labors of this wonderful" com
mission will be of but little value. : .

supposed to be pre
eminently suited to be
one of the elect. No
doubt his legal
knowledge and ex
perience with affairs
stamp him as ihe
most capable man of
the party. He and
Dewey and, now, Watson may be classed
as the bright minds of this remarkable
Junketing commission that are supposed
to be giving McKinley and the nation at
large an insight into how the Filipinos
should he governed.
I venture to state that Admiral Dewey
and the Officer who is now In command
of the naval forces, John C. Watson,
could and would make a. better report
upon the entire Question and all its
phases than any civil or military member
of this commission. Fancy three men,
each one needing a private secretary,
a special disbursing officer, a secretary
and four or five assistants, all drawing
salaries from the fathomless pocket of
Uncle Sam, under the "appropriation for
national defense"; carriages and horses
at their disposal, house rent free; and
an allowance for entertaining that has
been utilized but once in a public manner.
And what has resulted from this^com
mission's labors? So far as Otis is con
cerned as a member of the concern, naught,
for he rarely attendeditseittlngs, while, if,
the truth is known, Dewey. simply:, went
to the sessionp as a matter of duty. The
whole show seems to have been run by
Schurman and Worcester, aided by the
trio or rather quartet of Filipinos intro
duced into prominent notice as "amigos
de los Americanos."
To make some show, in view of the
presence of this commission, Otis has es
tablished petty courts of justice (or
rather a travesty), over which Filipino
shyster lawyers recommended by the
"amigos" preside.
Fancy a court in the South, presided
over by a negro judge, and a white man
ns the prisoner! What Justice would he
obtain? And this Is the state of affairs
here. An American soldier or .-ailor, a
civilian or any European has scant
jest i.e. 'They are fined ten or twenty
times more than a Filipino for the same
offense.
The intricate, obsolete, annoying
methods of Spanish procedure are still
in vogueâ modes misty and unfathomable,
that are beyond the comprehension of
not only the learned judge advocate of
the army, whose only experience has
been at the army post, but beyond the
power to unravel of the majority of the
so-called lepnl lights who have hung up
their shingles as "Abogados Ameri
canos."
Not content with consulting the alleged
"amlgOS," the commission through Otis
has subsidized a paper

And y.-t these two editors and their as

As a sequel to this religious war sus
tained in the papers edited by Filipinos
and the Dominicans, the Spanish resi

have no love for the rule exercised over
the islands in the past by the Friars,
they have respect and veneration for
the tenets of their religionâ and, also, it
must be remembered that in this Eighth

Special Dispatch to Tho fall.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 9.â The Secretary
of the Navy is not entirely satisfied with
the present conduct of affairs at the Mare
Island Navy-yard, having more especial
reference to the construction and repair
department. In order that ho might more
thoroughly be conversant with matters
he quietly had Naval Constructor Taylor
visit the Pacific Coast a few weeks ago
and report to him in person. The con
tinual wrangling among the working
force and Naval Constructor Frank W.
Hibbs, coupled with numerous letters
from State Senator Luchslnger, Congress
man Victor Metcalf and several business
nifii of Valiejo, has rendered him not at
all agreeable when discussing matters
about that locality.
Labor unions in San Francisco have for
warded him any number of documents
bearing on the recent reduction of wages
at the y;ird. He realizes the fact that
in order to accomplish the best results
complete harmony should exist between
the employes and tho her.d of each de
partment, and he is seriously considering
a relief for Naval Constructor Hibhs, al
though nt present there seems to be no
one available to fill the position.
Hobson, who is now in Manila, has ex
pressed a desire to return a little later
on. and he may be given the duty in rec
ognition of his past meritorious services.

passage to Manila on the transport Nan-
Hhan, as he had been ordered to return
here hy his superior. And so the merry
religious war goes on.
Commissioner Worcester Is very much
to blame in the matter, for not only in
his book on the Philippines but since his
arrival here he has exhibited the utmost
dislike and hatred to all connected with
the Catholic church, and in lieu of acting
as a conciliator, he has fomented in every
way the bad feeling dormant among the
natives. His "amigos" are wpII posted on
the value of the, property of the various
religious orders and are hopeful, with his
aid, of obtaining their lands if some meth
od is devised to sell them on orders from
Washington.

ceedings are practiced against the owners

by the church and the
various orders by the

protests, he pays what rent he pleases (in
many rases retaining payment for several
months until it suits his conveni
ence to pay) and in some instances
the buildings are forcibly entered by
armed guards that take possession. An
instance, of this kind took place last week,
with regard to a large building under the
care of the. Archbishop's office. The de
tails and forcible entry have been sent to
Rome and no doubt the papal legate and
some of the Catholic clergy in the United
States will bring the matter before the
President.
Raymond Sulzer Is an assistant quarter
master here and his lot is far better than
If he had remained in New York as a pet
tifogging attorney. Since his arrival he,
in common with all the officials connected
with the administration department of
the army, except perhaps Major Bralnard
and Major Sam Jones, have shown an
open preference in all bids for public
works and supplies to patronize English,
Chinese and, in fact, every nation except
Americans.
This Sulzer shares with the captain of
the port. Lieutenant Braunersreutherâ j
the hero of Guamâ the odium of dislike, |
not only of civilians but also of ninety per j
cent of the army and navy, with whom |
they come in contact. With regard to the j
latter, opinion is unanimous. No one has j
a good word for him. He cannot be civil
to any one except his superiors, to whom i
he cringes. Public gossip is severe anent
this captain of the port, as his salary as j
a- lieutenant in the navy is not at all j
commensurate to maintain his style of j
living. He rides a splendid Australian â 
horse that at the present rate of horse- I
fltsh cost at least $1000, while the dash
ing carriage that his wife and daughter |
use. accompanied by a coachman and j
tiger in buttons and a cockade forsoothâ
to ape the styles used by the foreign Con
sulsâcost a good round sum. The inter- j
preter of his office, who was miserably
poor when the American occupation of j
Manila took place, now rides around in a j
swell turnout and sports diamonds, on a ;
salary ot 200 Mex's monthly. From all \
these incidents conclusions are drawn, j
Merchants and shipowners are wishing j
the return to the office of captain of the
port of an officer like Captain Henry j
Class or some one of his type, so that the .
discourtesy shown by Braunersreuther !
and his immediate Inferiors would be at
an end.
The various correspondents have devot- j
ed themselves to denunciations of Otla
and his shortcomings, but have refrained
from noticing the various officers who de- \
serve far greater scorching for their in- j
capacity and uselespness. To give a list :
would occupy a column, but prominent â¢
for getting credit for work that is done by
his immediate subordinate officers and
men is the depot quartermaster. Major
Devol. His men, Captain Walcott, Lieu
tenant Haisch, Civil Engineer Mead of
Kan Francisco, Transportation Chiefs
Norton and Harvey and others do all the
work, and Devol, Looking wise and assum
ing an air of knowing everything, gets the
credit. Not a line of praise has been
vouchsafed to the members of the pay
corps under Colonel MacClure, an kudos
hns given the people of the United States
the idea that Major Brainard and his
corps of officers and men of the subsist
ence department have worked themselves
nigh unto death, despite all the obstacles
placed in their way by Devol, whose spite
against some of the members of the sub
sistence department was always a matter
for comment. Paymasters, few in number
considering the large body of troops here,
work day and night, incur danger when
out on the lines in performance of their
du'ies, but of whom no mention is made.
That efficient officer. Captain Martin of the
Fourteenth Infantry, whose duty it is to
keep the streets of Manila in order and
attend to sanitary matters, has never
been deemed worthy of notice. And in
deed if any man is worthy of praise Mar
tin is that man. Considering the filthy,
disgusting state of the public and private
residences, and offices, the dirty streets
and byways of this town, that had been
uncleansed for more than a year, and look
ing with impartiality at the resistance
of the inhabitants to sanitary methods,
Martin has accomplished a work that, in
view of the annoyances and obstacles
prevalent, seems almost superhuman.
The work of Major Kilbourne, as the
general treasurer of the islands; of Major
Kehleher, as chief paymaster of civil
funds, has never been given a word of
praise, and yet these men, while never
catering for newspaper notoriety, like
Devol and others, are worthy of com
mendation.
Then, too, there was the gallant Miley,
whoso desire to conduct the extra work
imposed upon him by the cheeseparing
policy of Otis resulted in an attack of
brain fever that ended In death. Others
who get all praise c:in ride around in
carriages paid for by Uncle Sam, whose
purse is evidently unlimited in capacity.
It may be thought that in this letter I
have indulged in personal feelings. On
the contrary, my object in writing has
been to let the public of the United States
know of matters and events that the cor
respondents of the various newspapers
are ignorant of and have little desire to
make public, devoting their attention to
military rather than civil subjects.
In my next it will be shown how these
wily Filipinos sought to entrap Otis into
assuming the presidency of the cutthroat
Katipunan Society, and also to show the
restrictions, the burdens, the unjust im
positions that Americans are suffering
under in common with Europeans. One
word in conclusion, it is better to be a
Chinaman. Filipino or Englishman, or,
Indeed, any nationality at present, than
to be an American, for under this Otis
regime and in combination with the
course pursued by some of his subordi
nates American merchants and those
who desire to settle here and aid in de
veloping the islands are subjected to the
grossest insults ana injustice.
As this mail leaves the news, welcome
to otis and all the military world, is to
the effect that the commission is ordered
home. Jt is no secret that thoir return in
an official sense is not wished, as now
military operations can be entered into
without seeking advice from Worcester
and his amigos. FLOWEK.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 9.â The report of
Quartermaster General Ludington, made
public by the War Department to-day,

DENOUNCES THE
TRANSVAAL WAR
Andrew Carnegie Favors
the Boers.
Disi ntoh to Tho Call.
NEW FORK, Nov. o.â Andrew Carnegie
and Mrs. Carnegie were passengers on the
Whit. - mship Oceania, which ar
rival to-day from Liverpool. Mr. Car
negie appears to be in good health. He
said to a reporter that the reports that ho
intended to become a citizen of Great
Britain were without foundation, for, he
said, "where a man's treasure is, there
his heart is also."
Speaking of the present war between
England and the Boers, Mr. Carnegie
said: "The war against the Boers is most
infamous and unjust and it is brought
about by P^ngland's hist for domain and
is on a par with our attack on the poor
Filipinos. These two attacks are a dis
grace to both branches of our race.
"The people in the Transvaal and the
Orange Free State have a right to rule
themselves. One war is an attack on an
existing and the other on an embryonic
republic, _Â
â¢'lt is worse for us to attack the Fili
pinos than for England to attack the
Boers, for we fail from a greater height,
as \v.- believed In government by consent
of the governed. The best men in Eng
land have spoken against the war in the
Transvaal and everywhere it is deplored
excepi by those whose Interests are
served by it. They are a small clique of
jingoes, beaded by a statesman, 1 am sor
ry t<i say. who set In the war a chance to
fortify his position."
Mr. Carnegie entertained decidedly opti
mistic views "f the business outlook and
the prosperity of the country. He said:
â â I ran only look at the business outlook
here fmm abroad, which Is sometimes a
g 1 point of view. Bui I believe that no
thing can stop 1900 from being a year of
great prosperity, always provided that in
view of â¢' excited state of the
world and the danger of war begetting
war. the United States keeps out of the
struggle. Now that this country has for
eign possessions there is more danger
than ever."
Mr. Carnegie declined to reply to a ques
tion as to whether it were true that the
syndicate headed by H. <"\ Frick had
failed to organise thi ' company
to purchase his steel -â â â¢' Iron properties.

Premier Salisbury Makes One Slaniflcant
Statement While Speaking of He
South African War.
LONDON, Not. 9.â At the Guildhall I
banquet to-night the Marquis of
Salisbury, Lord Wolseley, Mr.
Ritchie. Lord George Hamilton,
Lord Halsbur>-, the Lord Chief Jus
tic*, the Duke of Marlborough and a few
minor diplomats were present. Mr. Cham
berlain was absent. Lord Salisbury and
Lord Wolseley were warmly cheered as
they passed from the reception In the li
brary into the banquet hall. The Lord
Mayor proposed the "Ministers" in a
â¢peech in which he vigorously denounced
'the Ignorant arrogance of the invader."
dwelling on the fact that Sir Alfred Mil
ner, in spite of herculean exertions, was
unable to "prevail with the overbearing.
corrupt oligarchy, therefore other of our
Champions have the business in hand."
During the course of the banquet Lord
Wolseley announced that orders had been
Given to mobilize another division for
Bouth Africa and that the Government
was quite prepared to mobilize a second
army corps.
Replying to the toast "The Army," pro
posed In warm terms by Alderman Tre
loar. Lord Wolseley said:
"Every day applications are received
from volunteers in all parts of the em
pire who wish to be sent to the front. I
am proud of the sailors, soldiers and vol- '
unteers, who are among you. We have
bard work before us, for our foe is brave
and it Is no mimic warfare in which we I
are engaged. When one reads of the work I
which our local forces in Natal have done !
In the past few weeks one must deem
Lh-em worthy of standing side by side with
the best regulars. We at present have
mobilized only one army corps, consisting
of 55,000 men, of whom 44,000 are already
on the way to the Cape. To-day orders ;
have been sent to mobilize another divi
â ion, and if called upon by the Minister to
knobilize another army corps we are quite
prepared to do so."
Lord Salisbury, rising at a quarter-past
D to reply to the Lord Mayor, was greeted
with intense enthusiasm, prolonged cheer
. ing and a general waving of handker- j
chiefs. . The Premier said:
"I have had to answer for many years ;
6imilar.kind receptions in this hall, but j
never before under conditions that justi- ,
fied me in appealing so confidently to your
sympathy and support as in the present |
grave state of public affairs. Before turn
ing to this s-oriuus point, my duty la to
Inform you that our situation in South J
Africa is the only part of our relations ;
â with other nations to which any term of
apprehension or doubt can be applied.
"For several years our relations with i
and cordial feelings toward our kinsmen
;on the otiier side of the Atlantic have
been constantly growing, and though 'â 
neither we interfere in the affairs of their
country, nor they interfere in the affairs
of ours, we feel we can always look for
sympathy and a fair hearing among those
who share with us so vast a mission for
the advancement of mankind.
"But perhaps you think I am sanguine j
in saying that on the continent of Europe
we have no hostility to fear. There is '
undoubtedly . a certain acerbity of tone
among the writers for the foreign press, j
but I Ho not believe that the trend of this '
opinion "affects the peoples of foreign na- ;
tions. I am quite certain it does not af
fect their Governments and I will say that
1 have noticed, as one of the cheering
symptoms of the present time, the happy
relations existing between the United
States and ourselves (cheers) and the
sympathy with which we watch their ap-
I'rn;u:h jo the same great problems that
we ourselves have had to solve. That is
not to say that I do not feel the greatest i
sympathy with their late antagonist, the
kingdom of Spain. We entertain the high
est hope that out of that war a blessing
in <H.'-sui?e will growâ an abundant
growthâ civilization and culture in that
ancient md most interesting monarchy. '
"This morning you had intelligence of '.
an agreement between ourselves and one
of the groat continental States, with
which fur many years we have enter
tained relations of sympathy and friend
ship beyond others. Samoa is not in It
self a very important matter, but it was
Important because it constituted a subject
of difference between ourselves and a j
nation whose goodwill we prize very high
ly. I do not know entirely the reason why
the German people and Government at
tach so much importance to Upolu, but ;
they do and we are very glad to find the ;
means whereby, without in the least di- ,
minishing the rights and advantages of
England, we are able to gratify their j
views and sentiments. The agreement is
â¢somewhat complicated, but, roughly, It
may be said that the Germans had great !
interests in this island because they have j
invested large amounts in its cultivation
and because they have constructed a !
great commerce of which they are proud.
The islands, therefore, are of great value
to them. To us, on the other hand, isl
ands are generally only valuable when
they furnish good harbors. Upolu fur
nishes a very bad harbor. You will re
member the great hurricane when a Brit
ish man-of-war escaped and when Ger
man and American men-of-war were
driven ashore. Well, in these circum
stances, we were glad to accept a renun
ciation of the treaty claims and rights of
Germany of another inland, Tonga, where
there is an admirable harbor. We took
the harbor and Germany took the terri- ;
tory in which for many reasons the Ger- !
mans are Interested. I believe we have
arrived at a remarkable' phenomenonâ an
agreement which Is agreeably pleasant
and advantageous to both powers, but
this is Interesting particularly because It
indicates that at the present moment our
. relations with the German people are all i
we could desire.
"The great subject that interests all of j
us undoubtedly Is this war, adorned with |
so many splendid teats of heroism and j
skill, but saddened by so many losses. 1
have great difficulty in dealing with the
war and, if I attempted to deal with thÂ«
future 1 should be undertaking a task in i
prophecy from which the hardiest would i
ehrink. If I speak at all it may rather
be to deprecate criticisms and statements
which I think unfounded than to attempt
to pass Judgment on what still depends
upon the future for its full determination.
" "Respecting the feeling expressed twice i
or thrice that tho want of troops Is dua
to a want of action on the part of the
home government, I would point out that
there have been two or three voices. Two
or three months ago we were told by the
most authoritative voice outside the Gov- j
ernment that there was no occasion for j
military preparation* Since then we have
been blamed because there were no mili
tary preparations. But neither of these
'criticisms Is at all relevant to the events
which have been taking place. It has
been often said, especially abroad, that
we are a strong nation attacking a weak
one, but so long as the principal part of
our' forces is separated by an Interval of
live or six weeks from the field of action
It would rather be* true to say that we
are a weak nation fighting a strong na
tion. Elements of distance are very es
sential In this matter. \
"It would have been nothing to ( the
purpose for issuing proclamations for, the
reserves some weeks earlier. For what
was the cause of the war and what was
the cause of the ultimatum? It was not
LORD SALISBURY. THE
BRITISH PRHMIi:R,
"Whose utterances at the I.ori
Mayor's banquet on the Transvaa
question will engage the attentioi
of the world.
because of any demand wÂ» had made.
Tt po happens at the moment the ulti
matum was issued we had withdrawn our
demands and there were no demands be
fore the Transvaal Government. I r was
because we had taken measures to in
crease the amount of our forces In South
Africa. But if that hnÂ«l !â¢â  i few
months sooner exactly the same result
would have taken place. The moment
you had shown signs of raising your force
to an equality with the force of South
Africa, that moment the ultimatum would
have been Issued and war would have
begun.
"It is not, therefore, rlpht to say that
there was not adequate military prepa
aration. The evil dates farther back.
It dates to those unfortunate arrange
ments in ls^l and IS^4 by which we delib
erately permitted a community obviously
hostile to enjoy the unbounded, unlim
ited right of accumulating munitions of
! war against us. Year after year an ac
cumulation of munitions was male which
! could only be directed against us. Ham
pered by these arrangements It was im
possible that we should avoid the in
terval of trial and danger necessary to
. intervene between the moment when war
was declared and the moment when our
forces could accept the contest and ap
; pear upon the field.
"That interval has nearly passed. Our
troops are beginning to arrive. Foreign
' nations have, complimented us upon the
j raininess with which we have received
the intelligence of occasional checks.
Whatever strategy there might be, we are
well aware that the beginning of our con
flict with the Boers must be marked by
a retirement of our troops from positions
they are not strong enough to occupy.
It Is necessary that we should wait for
sufficient reinforcements. I do not at
tempt to forecast the future. I only say
i that my faith in the British soldier Is
unbounded, and I am deeply gratii
feel that he Is In the vigorous, sagacious
hands of Genera! Buller.
"Regarding the future T will only dep
rer-ate some very strange assertions that
T see occasionally in the Continental press.
Only the other day I saw it asserted
not by a chance writer, but by a man
who has been a member of the French
Governmentâ that this war had for Its ob
jects the gratification of the lust of
greedy lords, who desired a partition
among themselves of the gold and dia
monds of the Transvaal. Now, I beg; to
assure this gentleman that her Majesty's
Cabinet have nut had a farthing from the
Transvaal or from any other H'<\r\ fields.
There is the Yukon, about which there
is no contest. If there bad been any
chance of our gaining advantages these
Yukon gold fields should have yielded
something; but I appeal to my friend,
Ty->rd Hamilton, to know if the Cabinet
ever had a farthing from her, (Laugh
ter.)
"I go further. England as a whole
would have had no advantage from the
possession of gold mines except as her
Government conferred the blessing of
good administration upon those engaged
in the industry. All industry breeds com
merce and all commerce has produced is
to the advantage of England, and all in
dustries and commerce flourish better un
der her Government than any other
regime in the world. But that is the limit
of our interest.
"What we desire is equal rights before
all men and all races and security fur
our fellow subjects and our empire. The
, hour for asking hy what means these
results can be obtained Is not yet come,
but these arc the objects and the only ob
jects we seek. We do not allow any other
consideration to cross our path. I tiave
seen it suggested -and It seems to me a
wild suggestion that the other powers
will interfere with this country and in
some form or other dictate to Lhose who
are concerned in It as to what Its upshot
had been. Don't let any man think it
is in that fashion the conflict will be con
cluded. We shall have to carry it
through ourselves, and the interference
of anybody else will have no effect upon
It. (Cheers.) In the first place, because
we would not accept that interference,
and In the second place because we arÂ»
convinced that there is no such idea in
the mind of any government in the world.
"Within my recollection Ihere have
been some five or six great wars, involv
ing in their close great territorial
modification, but, except as provided Tor
by treaties and except In the case of
treaties, in none of these wars !ms a
third party ventured to interfere be
tween the combatants, in none of these
wars has nny nation claimed a ri^lu to
demand what the issue of the contest or
Its terms should be. They have not
claimed That right because they cannot.
It is not in accordance with international
law that they should possess it. There
fore such dreams should he set aside.
"Wherever we are victorious we shall
consult the vast Interests committed to
our care. Vast duties lie upon us to
perform, find, taking council of the.uni
form traditions of our colonial Govern
ment and of the moderation and theequal
Justice to all races of men which it has
been our uniform practice to observe. I
do not doubt we shall so arrange that the
issue uf this content will confer good gov
ernment upon the area where It rages
and give the security sorely needed
against the recurrence of any such
dangers and the necessity of any future
exertion and for the restoration of peace
and civilization to that portion of the
world."
I,orrl Salisbury resumed his seat amid
a tremendous ovation.

PRESS COMMENT ON
SALISBURY'S SPEECH
LONDON, Nov. 10.â As waa anticipated,
Lord Salisbury In his speech at the Lord
Mayor's banquet last evening said prac
tically nothlne that would throw light on
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, FRIDAY. NOVEMBER 10, 1899.
; the ultimate fate of the Boer republic.
. The speech was of the commenting rather
; than of the informing order. The pro
-1 Boer Daily Chronicle rather hastily Inter
prets his phrase, "We seek no gold, no
territory," as meaning that the national
rights of the republic will be respected In
the final settlement. It thinks his words
i "will fall with soothing effect on Dutch
men in South Africa," and even goes so
far as to say that if they had been
spoken sooner they would have prevented
! war altogether. "This is quite an iso
lated view. Every Cabinet Minister has
' made the same profession both before and
since the war began, and Lord Salisbury
distinctly disclaimed any idea of defining
the ultimate settlement. The Important
points in his speech, which attracted uni
versal attention and gratification, are his
references to the friendship of the United
States and Germany and his plain state
ment that there will be no European In
tervention. Such assertions coming from
Lord Salisbury will do much to restore
the confidence of the country."
The Daily News, dwelling at some
length upon" Lord Salisbury's reference to
' the. United States, says: "When we are
told to bow our heads in shame before the
' tirades of the Continental press we may
be excused for preferring the unbought
opinions of our colonial fellow subjects
and our American friends. Lord Salis
bury's remarks upon the 'vast mission'
we share with the United States may be
taken us an expression of his sympathy
! with the new task in which the United
States is engaged."
The Times says: "Lord Salisbury spoke
in a tone of gravity, which, far from In
dicating depression and still less dismay,
marks the frame of mind becoming cour
; ageous and thoughful men during a period
; of anxious suspense."

TRAIN DELIBERATELY
WRECKED IN MICHIGAN
Ttiree Persons Are Seriously Injured and Ten
Others Are Suffering From Bruises and
the Severe Shaking Ud.
TOLEDO, Ohio, Nov. 9.â Michigan Central train No. 310, from Toledo to Detroit, was ditched by the spreading of raits
between Alexis and Vienna. Mich., about 8 o'clock to-night. Three persons were seriously injured. They were: John
McKay. Indianapolis: John O'Neill, Detroit, fireman; William Hamilton, engineer. Ten other persons were painfully
hurt and fifteen or twenty others badly shaken up.
William Hamilton, the engineer was thrown through the window of his cab and, though perhaps fatally injured,
he retained sufficient presence of mind, when he recovered from the shock, to hurry to his engine and draw the fire, thus
preventing an explosion.
The accident was the result of a deliberate piece of work by unknown train wreckers and happened at a point Just be
yond a short trestle. U here the rails spread It was found that the bolts that had held the fishplates had been unscrewed.
The nuts were lying on the ties and the threads of the bolts were not marred in any way. A couple of big wrenches, such as
section hands use. were found lying beside the track, indicating how the rails had been loosened.
The early reports of the wreck were nlarming. and the railroad company summoned every available physician from
Toledo and elsewhere. A special hospital train was ordered from Detroit and the injured will be taken there.
EASEMENT MAY
BE COMPLETED
Sacramento Chamber of
Commerce Takes
Action.
â¢ Special IMspatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Nov. 9.â Ever since
the rendering of the Supreme Court de
cision which had the effect of abolishing
the office of Commissioner of. Public
Works, held by E. E. Leake of Wood
land, the taxpayers and business men
of Sacramento and Yolo counties have
been concerned over the preservation of
the easement constructed at Elkorn up
the Sacramento River by Commissioner
Lcake.
It is thought by some legal. authorities
that the money remaining in the original
legislative appropriation could lawfully
be applied to the completion of the ease
ment and jetties constructed on the Sac
ramento and SanJoaquin. The Sacramento
Chamber of Commerce has Interested the
Governor in the matter, and he, after a
visit to the easement, described It as a
splendid piece of work, and one which
would prove of great value to navigation
and the farming Interest*
As Indicating the public anxiety to have
the Elkhorn easement properly cared for,
the Board of Supervisors of Sacramento
county at yesterday afternoon's session,
unanimously adopted the following reso
lutions:
Whereas, The preservation of the rivers Is
of paramount Importance to the producing and
commercial Interests of the State, and whereas,
the harmonious relation that existed between
the United States Government engineers and
the State Commissioner of Public Works and
the auditing; board during the last two years
greatly expedited the work on river improve
ment,'and whereas, the improvements inaugu
rated by the Commissioner of Public Works
and prosecuted by the auditing board on the
Sacramento River have proved to be of great
benefit to the commercial Interests of the Sac
ramento Valley and to the land owners and
producers on either side of the river, and
whereas, the weir near Elkhorn and the jetty
at Xewtown shoals were somewhat Impaired .
by the htch waters 'of last winter and should
be repaired to prevent' further Injury to said
works if not their total destruction 'by the

Resolved by the Board of Supervisors of Sac

DIPLOMATS DISCUSS
"OPEN DOOR" IN CHINA
State Department Visited by Russian,
French and Other Foreign
Representatives.
WASHINGTON. Nov. P.â The diplomatic
representatives of every nation directly
interested in the Chinese Question called
at the State Department to-day. Tt was
noticeable that the calls of the Russian
Embassador, Count Casslnl, and the
French charge d' Affaires, M. iThiebaut,
on Secretary Hay lasted longer than
usual, and the Chinese Minister. Mr. Wu,
extended his call to include Assistant Sec
retary Hill, who has been giving much at
tention to the subject of the trade rela
tions of the United States in the Orient.
The interest of the Chinese Government
in what is going on between the tni'-d
States and the European powers is In
tense, but it is believed that tiecretaiy
Hill has relieved the main apprehension,
which was founded upon a suspicion that
our Government, in the event that the
European powers failed to give the formal
assurance of the maintenance of the
"open door" that it seeks, would take
possession of a section of the Chinese
coast before it is nil taken up by other
powers. So confident are the officials of
Buccess that it is Intimated they have not
even gone to the length of framing a
policy to meet the event of defeat. No
answer has been returned by France to
our Inquiry as to a formal assurance Of
the retention of trade privileges. Tt Is
scarcely expected that the French stipu
lation will apply to Tonquin and the sec
tions of China that have been under
French influence for a long time past
but so apply to any extension of French
holdings.
Trouble With Chinese.
VACAVILLE, Nov. 9.- War is threat
ening agiin in Chinatown. Since the
shooting of a merchant named Capay
Tnm. Chinatown has been ablaze with
posters warning the Chinese that there
will be more shooting. This it is
thought, Is for the purpose of Intimidat
ing Chinese witnesses. Chinatown is now
patrolled nightly by officers and their
deputies, who fear an outbreak any
moment.

STATE TRIAL IN
FRENCH SENATE
Crowds About Luxem
bourg Palace.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS. Nov. 9.â Crowds began to as
semble in the vicinity of the Luxembourg
Palace about noon to-day In anticipation
of the opening of the state trial in the
Senate. The police formed a cordon
around the building. Traffic was almost
interrupted. The police prevented fac
tional gatherings around the leaders of
the anti-Semites, Nationalists and anar
chists who were present. There was a
slight incident in the appearance of Henry
Rochefort, who received an ovation amid
shouts of hostility for the members of
the High Court.
The fifteen men accused, who had been
convoyed to cells in the Senate House dur
ing the morning, were all conducted to
their places by Republican Guards.
When M. Fallieres, president of the
Senate, followed by law officers, took his
seat at 1 o'clock the names of the Sen
ators were called. Fifteen failed to an
swer. M. Fallieres then called the names
of the defendants and all replied in loud
ton< s.
M. Deroulede, replying to the usual
question as to his profession, said: "De
fender of the rights of the people "
An usher then read the long indictment,
to which the audience paid little attention.
The Senate adjourned the public hearing
until to-morrow, and deliberated behind
eloped doors on the question whether the
Senators who were absent at the. opening
of the sitting could be allowed to take
part in the future proceedings. It was
finally decided by a vote of ISO to 160 to
exclude the absent Senators.
During ihf session to-day the witnesses,
â¢who number 400, having created an up
roar, werp expelled in bunches of ten. The
spectators left the palace without any un
toward incident occurring.

MORINEL IS
GAME BUT
UNLUCKY
Away Poorly, She Gave Dr.
Sheppard a Hard Rub.
Tanforan Events.
For a time during the pMBTCM of the
mile and a sixteenth run at Tanforan
Park yesterday the backers of the 1 to 5
favorite. Dr. Sheppard, felt very uneasy.
Away none too well, Mortnel, wfth 107
pounds and Morgan in the saddle, went
at the big horse, and at the paddock he
began climbing. The little mare about
this stage cracked, and the Doctor, groat
ly to the. relief of his admirers, won by
a couple of lengths, with Tommy Burns
trailing. El Estro from the Baldwin sta
ble was the only other starter.
The track was slower than on the pre
ceding: day and the mud larks were right
at home. Of the other favorites < himura
and Marcato earned brackets.
The Raclne-Mlnetta gelding was a warm
tip for the opening i ,-ear-old Bcram
bif.' After being played from 5 to 3 his
price again went to fi, and in a drive
Devin landed him winner over Burdock,
the favorite, by half a length. Giro had
a large following In the ring, but Burns
managed to get away from the post poor
ly, and ran unplaced.
To the splendid riding of Eddie Jones
was due the victory of the 10 to 1 shot
Campu in the sprint following. Getting
away from the barrier first, he hustled
the Kingston colt out in the lead, and
when challenged by Castake, with T.
"Walsh up, and Stromo ridden by Burns,
he rode a desperate finish, beating the
lirst named nurse a nose on the post.
Sorrow, the favorite, showed intermittent
bursts of speed, finally landing among the
also rans.
The mile and a sixteenth run was only
a gallop for Corrigan's Chimura, the post
favorite. There were only two other
Hart â¢ â  Roadrunner and Balista, the for
mer taking the place.
In the six furlong handicap, with but
tour starting, the Ryan pair, Marcato and
Afamada, rated prohibitive 1 to 8 favor
ites, coupled. Rio Chlco led Into the
stretch, where Marcato passed him, win
ning in a gallop. Afamada ran third.
The crowd unloaded on Tullamore, the
mount of Burns, to win the closing five
furlong: dash, and Votente struck the wire
two lengths before him. Tommy lost half
an acre of ground by a sweeping turn into
the straight for home, while J. Walsh, on
Potente. cut cross-lots, winning cleverly.
riamaway, a 50 to 1 chance, backed down
to S, ran into the show.

A force of forty men under command of
Union Pacific Detective T. JefT Carr is
patrolling the railroad yards to-night to
prevent &ny movement on the part of the
strikers to destroy property or intimidate
m< n still at work. The precaution is ap
parently needless, as the strikers afe very
Qulei and orderly. Beveral secret meet
ings were held this afternoon and to
nlght, but a definite conclusion was not
arrived at. If any work is sent from

demand will be made of labor unions to
call a general strike along the line. Some
of the leaders state that by to-morrow
niprht the men In the North Platte shops
will also have struck, but the statement
Is deemed exravajrant by those posted on
the situation at that and other points on
the line.

GOOD BALL
PLAYED BY
OLYMPIANS
Initial Indoor Game Proved
Highly Interesting and
Exciting.
A shattered window and a broken chan- I
delier are .-vldences that a game of indoor j
baseball was played at the Olympic Club j
last night. If the "fans" who go to
Recreation Park twice a week had .seen
the opening game of the club they would
have weeped for joy. Such an exhibition
has rarely been seen on this coast. The
two teams played with a ball as large as
the ones Admiral Dewey used in his
memorable sea- fight, and the players '
Juggled it as if they were doing a turn, j
at a variety theater. There was also j
enough kicking at the umpire's decisions
to make that much abused official wish
he were elsewhere.
The initial game was arranged by Cap
tain James and proved highly amusing
and exciting to players and spectators
alike. Phil Wand and Arthur at. Stone
chose sides, and sixteen members, attired
In costumes of every shade and descrip
tion, were picked to play the game.
Wand's team was known as the "High- i
balls" and Stone's aggregation played !
under the euphonious title of "Lallapa
loosas" and succeeded in scoring
twenty-two runs to the "Highballs' " six
teen. Nine- innings were played in one
hour and fifteen minutes, but the time
would have been much less If George j
Knell, Official Scorer Joe Stapleton and â 
"Jack" Gleason had not disputed over
the umpire's decisions. "Handsome Kee
gan" Monohan outshone the electric
lights as a "twlrler." His arm gave out !
in the fifth Inning and he retired behind
the bat. Some spectators thought Mono
han could catch cold better than he could
a ball, unless it was handed to him on a
tray. Eddie Boyle was attired In a
beautiful creation, but no ladies were
present to view his costume. Charley
Derham caught everything that came his j
way and batted himself Into tho hearts :
of the spectators. C. Pray pitched for |
the "Highballs" and in nine innings neld ,
his opponents down to twelve hits, gave |
three bases on balls, and hit four batters,
and W. Haley knocked enough home
runs and two-baggers to make himself
and friends happy. The teams lined up
and scored as follows:

ARRANGING FOR THE
COMING CONVENTION
San Francisco Members of California
State Association for Storage of
Flood Waters Hold Pre
liminary Meeting.
The San Francisco delegation to the
! convention to be held r>--xt week under
ill of the California State Association
fur the Storage of Flood Waters met last
evening at the Palace Hotel and made
preliminary arrangements for the conven
i tlon. It was decided that the convention
should be called to order at 10:30 a, m.
next Tuesday, and that Mayor Phelan
should deliver an address of welcome to
tho d< legates. The following committee
was named to arrange for the hall and
j other preliminaries: President Thomas,
; F. W. Dohrmann and T. C. Frledlander.
, A recommendation was also made that t (l e
rs of the convention should consist
j of a president, two vice presidents and
I two secretaries.
Incidentally the subject of the opposi
' tlon of the delegates from Southern Cali
fornia to the State plan was discussed,
and President Thomas made some re
' marks, lie said there were points in the
National Irrigation Associations plan
Upon which the advocates of the State
plan could agree. 11>- believeo that all
were agreed that it was advisable to get
from the Government all that the (Jovern
ment would give, hut he reiterated that
the Government has no ownership of the
water In a stream, nor does it own the
bed of the stream, and that all its right,
constitutionally, in the matter is to regu
late navigation between States and with
foreign countries; also that If the Gov
ernment were to construct storage reser
| volrs for the purpose of maintaining the
levels of rivers there could be no help for
i irrigatora from that Bource. The meeting
whs well attended. Chief Justice Beatty
presided.
The fact being recognized that there
will be many delegates at the convention
Who have not reached definite conclusions,
It will probably be advocated upon the
floor of the convention that a permanent
organization shall be formed. P. W.
Dohrmann is the choice of the San Fran
cisco delegation for temporary chairman
of the convention.

The Alaska Exploration Company's !
ptraraer Homer arrived yesterday from j
Cape Nome, via Dutch Harbor, with
tighty-one cabin and ninety steerage
passengers' There was not a great
amount of treasure on the vessel,
about $200,000 worth of dust being In the
vessel's safe for the company and the
passengers having about $30,000 more
among them. The richest man on the
steamer was R. B. Dawson, a saloon
keeper. He started In business in a small
way and sold out just before the Homer
Balled for $30,030.
W. W. Hatch, who went to Nome In
June. LS9B, says of the conditions up there:
"The prospects at Nome this winter are ,
very poor. Hundreds of men are afflicted
with typhoid, and the death rate Is about
two or three a day. After the Cleveland !
and Albion leave there will be about 2000
people left to pass the winter at Nome.
Provisions are scarce, owl] to the wreck *
of the steamer Laurada. The vessel car
ried supplies for the soldiers, and when
they were lost the army people bought
a large amount of provisions at Nome.
Flour is now â ;> a sack, potatoes $12 a
crate, while meais cost all the way from
$150 to $2 50. Fuel is also scarce."
Three of the Homer's passengers were :
left at Dutch Harbor suffering from ty
phoid lever. When the steamer left Nome
the Cleveland and Albion were there and
expected to sail for San Francisco in
about a week. The Homer left the steam
'whalers William Baylies and Alexander

There is still no news from the bark
Ferris S. Thompson and schooner Ameri
can Girl. They left here in a howling
northwester on October 8 for Puget Sound
and the chances are both stood off shore.
Then the wind chopped around to the
southeast and has been blowing strong
from that quarter ever since. The
chances are that both bark and schooner
have been driven away past the straits
of Fuca and have been unable to beat
back.

FATHER YORKE WELCOMED
BY HIS COLLEAGUES
RECEPTION IN SACRED HEART
. . COLLEGE.
The Returned Priest Is Toasted at a
Brilliant Bmquet â Responds
Feelingly to Words of
Praise.
It was moot that the first reception to
be-tendered to Rev. Father Yorkc should
be given to him by his colleagues in the
Catholic church and the banquet given in
his honor last night by the pastors and
p.<*is!ant pastors of the churches In the
State in the Assembly Hall of Sacred
Heart College! was a splendid success.
Kvery* parish church In this city and a
number; in the interior â ..,-. represented,
and the distinguished clergyman who has
done ?o much in the interest of the faith
of which he is a powerful exponent was
. toasted and welcomed In a manner that
must 'have done his heart good.
The committee of arrangements which
d-id all- in Its power to make the affair the
success that it was consisted of Rev. Fa-
thers J. M. Melvin, chairman; C. E.
O'Neill, secretary; H. Charles, W. Lyons
r,f St. Peter's, P. Heslin of St. Patrick's
P. Griffin of St. James, and J. J. Cranwell
of St. Mary's College, Oakland. Father
Heslin presided at the feast, which was
prepared by one of the most competent
caterers In the city, and during the dis-
cussion of the elaborate menu there were
speeches of sincere welcome to the hon-
ored guest.
â¢The first speaker was Father .Patrick
M. Ivin, who said that the best wishes of
every one had been with Father York-
through' all the stages of his long Journey
and now that he had once more returned
to the scene of his former labors the beat
SHIP ALEXANDER GIBSON OFF CAPE HORN.
FOR months past American and British ships have been having a terrible time of It rounding the Horn. Only a few
days ago dispatches came from London saying that two had been forced into Stanley and two more to put back to
Montevideo and Rio through stress of weather. Nevertheless, the Gibson made the run from 50 degrees in the Atlan
tic to 60 In the Pac ttc in ten days, and all Ball was carried duiing the trip.
Tliis is Captain Holmes' eightieth voyage around the Horn and on no occasion has he ever been longer than twenty
five days. On that occasion he was master of the clipper ship Haze and the delay was due to the breaking of the truss
foreyard. i; took a fortnight to mend the break so that sail could be carried on the yard. The quickest passage
aroupd the Horn made by Captain Holmes was in the Seminole. The run from 50 to 50 was made on that occasion in
nine days.
tain Holmes made his first visit to San Francisco In lS.'.p and has come here every year since except on two occa
sions. When he made his ound the Cape the natives were all cannibals. Now there are two missionary
and relief stations and the na..- that they render ready assistance to shipwrecked men.
The above picture shows thi Gibson oft' Diego Ramirez Islands, whichare Just south of the Horn. The nrlncipal island
Is higher than the South Farallon. yet Captain Holmes .-ays the waves will roll up one side, over the saddle back and
down the other side of the island.
s for his future success in his chos
en field wen
â \v-- very much fear," said Father Mel
vin, addressing himself to Father y/orke.

Reception to Father Yorke
On Monday evening next Rev. Peter C.
F/orke Will be tendered a public reception
in Metropolitan Temple by the Catholic
Truth Society. An address of welcome
will be delivered by E. P. Murphy, the
room are valuable cloth of gold vestments, belonging to
St. Mary's Cathedral, as well as the vestments of the
Greek Church, loaned by Bishop Tikhon. The crown was
presented to the Bishop by Czar Nicholas 111. An ex
qul.site piece of work is an embroidered dress of drawn
work done in pineapple cloth, made in Spain, seventy-five
years ago. A coat made In China in IS4I and brought to
this city on the ship Heber, in 1849, is an object of inter
est, as well as the "Forll Embroideries" made for the
Marquis Alblcini by twenty-five famous embroiderers,
who began their work in 1659 and finished it in 1705. A
tapestry woven In the Royal Atelier at Aubusson, France,
by Claude Joseph Vernet, in the eighteenth century, is
remarkable because It is probably the only one' treating
of marine scenes in existence.
Other exhibits Include an immense piece of embroidery
made 1 for the imperial family of China; four handsome
tapestries belonging to Mrs. Hearst; a piece of work on
pilk entitled "The Creation," made in the thirteenth cen
tury and loaned by Mrs. C. C. Caswell; some rare an
tique lace loaned by Mrs. K. S. Howard of Oakland.
A refreshment room has been fitted up and during the

RECEIVE THEIR
ORDERS TO SAIL

on Saturday.

MEMBERS OF THE FORMER ARE
BEING DISCIPLINED.
Colonel Schuyler Sends Out Provost
Guards to Bring in Strayed Sol
diers and Revokes All
Leaves of Absence.
The Forty-sixth United States Volun
teer Infantry Regiment will sail for the
Philippines to-morrow afternoon on the
transports City of Sydney and Pathan.
The Forty-sixth will be closely followed
by the Forty-fifth, which will sail Mon
day on the transports Senator and Ben
Mohr. Orders for the departure of the
two regiments for the scene of hostilities
were issued yesterday af tern Don and will
be somewhat, of a surprise to th<; Major
ity of the officers and men concerned, as
' the general impression around the vol
unteer camps was- that none of them
would get away before the middle or la^t
of next week.
Colonel Schuyler of the Forty-sixth
took vigorous measures to curb the wan
dering propensities of his men and at tho
j same time give them a taste of army dis
cipline yesterday morning by revoking all
leaves ot absence from camp and sending
out provost guards to gather in those who
had overstayed their leaves. Two hun
dred and , thirty-five men who were given
'â  temporary leaves of absence on Monday,
on which day the regiment received its
last month's pay, failed to show up at
; assembly and Colonel Schuyler at once
' ordered out the provost guard. Every
two hours during the afternoon three 01
--licers and thirty-six men left the camp on
* iive-nour detail to arrest and bring in
the recalcitrants. Several bunches of
Forty-sixth men who happened to be en
joying themselves in the resorts just out
side of the reservation were warned of the
approach of the provost guard and
scampered over the hills toward town. In
several instances the guard gave chase
and captured the runaways, although as
a rule the latter got away. All last night
the work of rounding up strayed soldiers
was continued and a large number of
them were gathered in. A goodly number
are yet at large, however, and it will le
quire hard work to get them all together
and ready to board the transports.
The Fortieth is next to the Forty-sixth
the greatest sufferer from the vagaries of
soldiers with temporary leaves of ab
sence, but the Thirty-eighth, Forty-fourth
and Forty-fifth also have their troubles.
Eight men of the Fortieth were yesterday
sentenced to do penance for absenting
themselves from camp after the expira
tion of their leaves.
Paul A. Perugia of the casual detach
i ment at the Presidio was yesterday \aken
i to Alcatraz Island to serve a sentence of
four years imposed by court-martial and
approved by General Shatter for disobey
ing the order of his superior officer and
threatening him with a revolver The
sentence also includes dishonorab ; e dis
charge from the army and forfeiture of
all pay and allowances.
The Nevada volunteer cavalry will be
the guests of the citizens' executive com
mittee at the Orpheum next Tuesday
night, arrangements to that effect having
been completed yesterday. B
The Tennessee volunteers are expected
to arrive in port from the Philippines on
the transport Indiana some time to-day
and aside from the welcome they will re
ceive from the delegation from their home
State upon their arrival Mrs. Mary a
Townsend has arranged to give the entire
regiment a banquet in Mechanics' Pa

be Saturday night. f-wauij

COMMISSION SIDE LIGHTS.
WE publish to-day a report sent to The Call by
a well known San Franciscan in Manila. As
it is testimony from the imperialist camp it
throws a useful side light upon the report of the Phil
ippine Commission. The reader will observe its
, ferocity of expression toward the natives and that
the writer criticize? everybody who has "not trampled':
! them with a hard heel. While he has no use for the
' natives, except to drive them, he paints a picture of j
ii in American administration there which j
may be usefully contemplated by those who pretend
that we are going to "educate"' the natives in pure ;
upright American ways. The writer is thor
oughly responsible. He knows what he is in Ma
nila for, and is a rugged type of the class of Ameri-
I cans who wait impatiently for the fruits of conquest.
While it may be said that his letter reflects personal
feeling, all Californians will interpret it fairly be
cause of the just estimate he puts upon officers like
tain Henry Glass of the navy and gallant Colonel
Milev, who succumbed to the attack brought on by
lr> unselfish and unmentioncd discharge of duty and
* rests now in a suldier's at the Presidio.
The writer, who happens to be neither Catholic nor
Protestant, draws an admonitory picture of the re
: Hgious situation and justifies the forecast of what is
â  'tut that has been made by many people in this
tntry. The ecclesiastical tenure of nearly all the
!r>.:uls that are worth tilling in the islands is but a
companion picture to the absorption of such lands in
, Hawaii by the missionaries and their descendants,
but as it is ecclesiastical the qnestion is a Pandora's
( box full of evils and troubles for this country long
after the natives have been subjugated.
The seething scene of slaughter, oppression, official
rascality, administrative incapacity and personal greed
ribed by our correspondent is evidence of the in
firmities of administration at such a vast distance
from the wholesome restraint of public opinion at
home. It is Yerres, Hastings and Give over again,
and so it will be to the end of this weird chapter.
When this letter is read in connection with the offi
: cial report to the War Department which we exclu
sively published last month, and both are considered
in connection with the proposition of Senator Davis
of Minnesota, chairman of the Committee of For
eign Affairs, that Congress shall at the next se-sion
keep hands off Porto Rican, Cuban and Philippine
affairs, and give to the Executive and the army free
rein in each of those dependencies, there arises a pros
pert that mi; â¢ â¢ every American who feels
ler of his country's honor. Yet the -Senator's
| proposition is a suggestion of the inevitable. In
this external administration over peoples so radically
ferent from our own, forced by military power out
of line with their own aspirations, and upon whom the
*-am experiment is being tried of whipping them out
of their racial characteristics, emergencies are inevit
with which Congress cannot deal, in regular or
ession. These must have executive treatment,
be it good or bad. and this will require a great ex
p nt of power to the President. This
tetul thing to contemplate, but it shares that
lity with nearly everything connected with the
subject
A YELLOW DISCOVERY.
T]IV. Examiner has discovered t!ie men whq blew
up the Maine. One of them offers to tell it all
for $20,000 and a chance to live in retirement
outside of Cuba and the United States. His story is
verified by a yellow correspondent at Havana, who
says he knows it is true because he can see the
wreck of the .Maine from the place where he is writing
his sti iry !
What could b< r confirmation! What ex
quisite detective skill! It is as if a San Francisco de
tective should declare that a man is murdered be
cause his name is in the dired
We have no doubt that Cuban woods are full of
men who will confess that they blew up the Maine
for a consideration of $20,000 and a chance to retire
to some chosen retreat to enjoy it. Rut what has
become of the Examiner, reward of $50,000 for the
miscreant? When the Maine \>. ti yed the Ex
aminer was twenty- fou,r hours behind its contem-
poraries in getting the new-;, but it used the wreck
for advertising purposes and announced that it had
notified all the crowned heads of Europe that it would
give $50,000 for the men who did the dastardly work.
Just which of the crowned heads it suspected of the
l ciinie has never transpired, but it worked the wreck
I for all it was worth ps an advertisement.
It? return to the subject now seem* to be a con
on that other means of sensational advertising
have hern exhausted, and rather than go at legitimate
journalism and newsgetting it takes another fall out
of the Maine.
In line with its policy the Examiner should pro
ceed to hire a man to confess, tell the names of ac
complices who are men of straw, then ostentatiously
pive him a check of which the payment has been
stopf. *i in advance, tb.cn photograph the check and
the wrt, *t and its own unutterable emotions, and then
pat itself . ti the back.
The Examiner has fallen so far behind as a news
paper that si ime time there may be public interest in
who wrecked it, and a reward of a nickel may pro
duce the man, provided he is protected from the en
thusiastic expression of hilarity and gratitude which
will be sure to accompany his appearance.
THE "CLUB HOUSE" GAMBLERS.
CREDIT is due t<Â» the police for the promptness
and skill with which the raid was made upon
the gamblers whose so-called social club was
i exposed by The Call last Friday. As a result of the
; raid a considerable number of gamblers are under
i arrest, and evidence is in the hands of the police to
prove the charges against them.
Since the police have done their duty the i^sue
in the case is for the courts to decide. The question
is whether, by organizing a "social club" it is pos
sible for gamblers to evade the statute forbidding the
maintenance of gambling-houses and the conduct of
gambling games. If the contention of the gamblers
be upheld by the courts we shall have practically
unlimited gambling until the Legislature amends the
law under which social clubs enjoy immunity.
As the matter is now before the courts for deci
sion it is not worth while to argue the validity of the
claim of the gamblers or the construction of the
statute. It would appear, however, that there ii
nothing in the law which can support their preten
sions. It is quite true the courts have thrown around
social clubs a great deal of protection, but they have
never gone so far as to declare that such clubs could
be legally used for the purpose of evading the statutes
of the State and for perpetrating offenses which are
punishable by fine and imprisonment.
Whatever may be the results of the trial, the police
have done their duty. They have raided the club
exposed by The Call and found there a number of
men engaged in gambling and a full faro layout. They
have therefore made a test case which will result in
determining the meaning of the law. For that they
THE SAN FRANCTSCO CALL, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 10. 1899.
deserve the commendation of the public. If gam
bling be carried on hereafter under the form of an
amusement of a social club it will be due to a defect
of the law and not to a fault of the police, and the peo
ple will know how to provide a remedy for the evil.
THE LAW AND TAX SHIRKING.
THE- express companies of the United States in
shirking their war taxes have been favored by
the law's delays probably beyond their fondest
expectations. The act requiring them to stamp their
receipts and bills of lading went into effect on June
13. 1898. It is now November, 1899, and although
shippers, Attorney Generals and Judges all over the
country have been working manfully for a year and
five months to enforce the law they are as far away
as ever from compelling obedience to it.
In Illinois a Court of Equity decided over a year
ago that the express companies are legally liable for
the tax; in Michigan the Supreme Court many
months ago issued a writ of mandate ordering stamps
to be affixed to receipts and bills of lading in that
State, in accordance with the statute; in California
the Superior Court in an action for damages has
placed the same construction upon the law. Here,
however, the law's delays have worked most potently.
Two cases removed to the United States Circuit
Court which involve the question have been under
submission on a motion to remand since June last,
and a decision of the Superior Court on a writ of
mandate has been on appeal for months and is not
likely to be decided for a year.
Certainly a sufficient number of cases have been
decided against the express companies to admonish
them that ultimately they are certain to be compelled
to pay the tax, but the burden amounts to between
$200,000 and $300,000 a year to each shirking com
bination, and all are consequently emboldened to
dispute the law to the end. Every day that passes
there is transferred from the pockets of the shippers
and placed in theirs between $3000 and $5000.
On Thursday a case involving the construction of
the law was argued in the United States Supreme
Court. The lawyers for the plaintiff, a shipper, intro
duced the same points on which all the previous
cases have been decided. The same answer was made
as in the suits against Wells, Fargo & Co. in this
city. The Adams Company, its attorney averred.
c-.rrir-; 28,000,000 packages annually, upon which the
law, if the plaintiff's contention is established, will
impose a tax of $280,00^), or 2 J 3 per cent of the
nominal par value of the corporation's stock. '"Th:>
is an unreasonable burden," argued counsel, "but if
it is paid by the shipping public it will not be felt."
Here is entertaining corporation logic. Shippers
do not feel the burden of taxes. They may be held
up and robbed of a million or so a year by the ex
press companies without producing in them the
slightest sign of pain. Rut the moment Congress
a>=ks a corporation to aid the Government in waging
a foreign war to the extent of a single cent rank in
justice i- perpetrated and the courts are appealed to
to prevent the outrage.
Evidently the corporations doing an express busi
ness in this country need disciplining. At its ses
sion next month Congress ou.ulit to take hold of
them and not only reimpose this tax but double it,
nnd forbid all thoÂ«e carrying on an interstate busi
s from increasing their rates. This would teach
them a le-son in patriotism which would not be lost.
OUR INTERESTS IN CHINA.
rOR some time past reports have been in cir
culation that the great powers of Europe wouH
soon call upon our Government to define its
nese policy and state how far it claimed a right
to trade in those parts of China which have recently
sed under the domination of Russia, German}' and
France. It has been stated that Count Cassini, tlv
Russian Embassador to this country, -.vas engaged
during his recent visit to Europe in discussing the
question with the different powers interested, and
would, upon hi-* return, open negotiations with Sec
retary Hay upon thr subject.
The Count has now Tcturned, and in our dispatches
of Wednesday there was given a summary of an in
terview with him in whirh he is reported to have
talked frankly and to have denied that he has any
intention of asking the United States what port or
"sphere of influence" they desire to occupy in China.
He is reported as saying:
"I saw many prominent public men while in
Europe, including Count Murafieff, and I assure
you that this is the first time that I have heard that
such a proposition was to be submitted to the United
States. In my talks at St. Petersburg, Paris and else
where many phases of the Chinese subject were di;
cussed, but nothing â absolutely nothing â occttm.l to
warrant any report Jthat I individually, or with others.
have any special inquiries to make concerning China.
To be sure this and all other current topics are in
formally discussed, but it can be stated positively that
I return without any special mission to perform and
without instructions relating to China. So far as
Russia is concerned her door stands open. The great
commercial port of Talien-Wan has been made free
to the commerce of the world by formal proclama
tion."
Count Cassini is a diplomatist, and a Russian dip
lomatist at that, so the public will receive with some
incredulity the statement that he "talked frankly."
I Still it is quite probable he told the truth when he
j stated he has not been charged to make any propo
sitions to 'our Government with regard to China. In
the first place no European power, nor combination
of powers, is in a. position to ask us to define our
Chinese policy, for not one of them is prepared to
define its own; and, in the second place, the Chinese
; problem has not yet reached a point where any defi
j nite solution of it is practicable.
There is in the situation, however, much which
tends to support the belief that sooner or later we
will come into conflict with those powers that claim
to have special interests and rights in what are called
their "spheres nf influence." The United States do
not claim jurisdiction or influence over a single acre
of Chinese territory, but they do claim the right to
opportunities of trade on equal terms with other na
tions in every part of China from north to south
and as far into the interior as any nation has a right
to trade. How our right to equal trade in all parts
of the empire can be reconciled with the aggressions
of European powers remains to be seen.
It will be noted Count Cassini states Russia has
made the port of Talicn-Wan free to the commerce of
the world. That is all right as far ns it goes, but the
question remains whether Russia could shut us out
if she chose. At present Russia has extended a
"sphere of influence" over two Chinese provinces,
Germany over one, France over an extensive region
in the south, and Great Britain claims influence over
the whole Yangtse Valley and its coast frontage. If
such claims go on Unchecked the time will soon come
when the whole sea front of China will be under
European influence. It will then be imperative upon
us to define our policy, whether we are asked to do
it or not. In fact, there are breakers ahead in Chi
nese waters, and our own ship of state is likely to be
involved in them.
MONSTER STRAY TURTLE
FOR A WATCH DOG
STRAY turtles, measuring four or five foot in length, do not often wander
unmolested through the streets of a thickly populated city. But not
long since a well-known family in Honolulu, H. 1., received a visitor
of this kind. Xobody knows where the great beast came from; he
simply appeared one day at the garden gate and, forcing an entrance,
proceeded to make himself at home on the premises. He was promptly ex
pelled by the astonished family, to wander once more on the city street?â for
they did not know what else to do with him. The turtle had different idea?,
however; he Viad found a comfortable home and meant to stay in it, he had
very likely led a life of hardship and intended to end his days in peace and
security, so he returned, but was again turned out. upon the cruel world. The
turtle had a will of his own ami was determined to live in that particular
spot, so he crawled in again the next time the gate was open. The family
gave up in despair, and allowed thp uninvited giu-st to remain a few days be
fore they turned him out again. But he returned once more. This perform
ance was repeated a number of times; if they shut the gate on him he would
rear up on his hind legs and put his fore feel <>n the topâ like a great dog.
It was necessary to accept the inevitable. The people to whom he wished
to attach himself began to feel a certain superstition, and allowed him to
take possession of the garden which he had so long coveted as his abode.
There he crawls about in the daytime and sleeps at night, and is given his
three good meals a day of bran and water, and scrap:- from the table-. He
is a perfectly harmless old fellow, and the children have groat sport with
him, two or three at a time riding on his back. It is only dangerous to place
a hand on the side of his neck, for. as he contracts his neck Quickly with
in his shell, it is likely to be drawn in and injured. But his funniest charac
teristic developed after he had been fairly accepted into the family circle:
in return for the kindness lavished upon him he took upon himself thoÂ«
functions of a watch dog. The poor beast Is not able to bark, but when a
straiiKt-r enters the gate he gives forth such loud and formidable hisses as
to fri^htf-n the most courageous until they discover that his hiss is worse
than his bite.
It is estimated that this great turtle is very old. While not of a rare
aprrios, he has grown to an unusual size. His neck Is beginning to shrivel
and take upon itself the drawn look of extreme age. It is thought by some
that he is the famous turtle that belonged to Kamehameha I. 11<> was the
gr< atest conqueror and King of th<- Hawaiian Islands, and lived over 100
years ago. The animal remained for generations in the custody of the royal
family, and last belonged to the queen dowager, Kaplolani, who died "n
June 24. Some time before the Queen's death the turtle disappeared. But
whether this queer old beast, with its almost human Intelligence, has Buch a
romantic history or not. it Is to-day one of the must Interesting sights of
Honolulu, though few visitors know of its existence.
RIGHTS OF HABEAS
CORPUS ARE SACRED
NEW POINT IN LAW DECIDED
BY SUPREME COURT.
Superior Judges Have Power to In
quire Into the Sanity of Asylum
Inmates Held for Crime.
The Supreme Court yesterday handed
down a decision involving the question
of habeas corpus in which points were
raised that have never been judicially
passed upon before. In the Insane Asy
i lum at Napa is a man named Hugh
Buchanan, 'who had been committed by
the Superior Court of Yuba County pend
ing his trial upon a charge of murder. A
friend of Buchanan named Muller pre
sented a petition for habeas corpus to
Judge E. D. Ham of the Superior Court
of Napa, setting forth that the patient
had recovered his sanity and was entitled
to be discharged from the asylum and re
delivered into the custody of the Sheriff
of Yuba.to be placed on trial. Judge Ham
issued the writ, making it returnable be
fore the acting Judge of the court, who
was Judge Joseph P. Jones of Contra
Costa County.'
1 Superintendent Dr. A. M. Gardner of the
Napa Asylum made return of the writ,
showing the commitment of Buchanan,
who in- alleged had not recovered his
sanity He ciaimed that Buchanan can
not be delivered to the Sheriff of \uba
County except upon the certificate of the
superintendent of the asylum showing
' that the patient had recovered his sanity.
Judge Jones decided that the superintend
ent's point was not well made and insisted
upon the command of the writ being com
plied with. Dr. Gardner at once applied
to the Supreme Court for a writ to pro
hibit Judge Jones from entertaining juris
diction in the habeas corpus case. Dr.
Gardner took the position that the Supe
rior Court of Napa County is without jur
isdiction or authority to order him to de
liver Buchanan on habeas corpus or oth
erwise under the statutes relating to the
commitment and discharge of insane per
sons. The Supreme Court, in discussing
the authority of the medical superintend
ent, the jurisdiction of the lower court
and the statutes, says:
A fair construction of all the : provisions of
the statutes on the subject letids to th- con
clusion that In a case like this the superin
tendent of the State Hospital may discharge
the patient and If he falls or refuses to act
| the Inmate may Institute the Inquiry Into his
sanity by the process of habeas corpus. â¢ â¢ Â«
Where he refuses to act ami resort is had to
the court we think the Judge has the power
not only to adjudge the patient to be sane,
but to order him redellvered to the Sheriff to
be dealt with under the Penal Code.
The opinion was written by Commis
sioner chipman, and Justice McFarland,
in a concurring paragraph, adds that the
right to the benefits of habeas corpus is
sacred and cannot be abridged.
SUPERVISORS' SALARIES.
Important Decision Involving the
Payment of County Officers.
A matter of law which has never been
passed upon by the highest State court
w.-is decided yesterday in the Supreme
Court. John W. "White is a Supervisor
and at the some time Road Commissioner
of his supervisorial district in Kern
County. Ilu presented a bill for salary
and mileage ninnunting to (1803 50, which
issed by the Supervisors, who or
the Auditor. B. A. Hayden, l<i draw
I for the same on the salary
county. This the Auditor re- I
to do. Next th â  order was to draw
rant on the road fund, which was'
also ;ru-i with a refusal. It was necessary ;
for White to sue and the case went to !
the - Supreme Court, his contention being
that the wages of Road Commissioner
Bhould be classed as "salary" and should
be paid out of the salary fund. The Su
preme Court upholds this contention, and :
as Its decision affects nearly every county [
"ARE YOU AX EXPANSIONIST?"
in th( â  principal point made is
worthy of quotation:
Whether the duties are performed in his
legislative or Judicial capacity while pitting
â¢with the hoard or whether acting rx-offlclo aa
road commissioner he is performing duties de
volved upon him by law as a Supervisor. As
he is a county officer and as there is a salary
fund created out of which county officers are
to be paid, we see no reason why he should
not be paid his entire compensation allowed
by law as Supervisor out of that fund. '-Sal
ary and "wages" are synonymous. Both
mean a sum of money periodically paid for
services rendered, and It Is immaterial how
the value of the services is ascertained

undivided, entire confidence of all the |
colonial circles in the Fatherland.
L<>NDON Nov. 9.â The afternoon
papers here express satisfaction at the
Samoan settlement. They are especially
gratified at the evidence of the continued
good feeling between the three nations.
The acquisition of Tutuila is regarded as
setting tlio seal on the expansion policy of
the I aited States and a great develop
ment of the I'nited States navy is antici
pated and welcomed.
PARIS. Nov. <i.â The Journal dos De
pats, winch finds the Samoan agreement
â¢ very significant from the view point of
Anglo-Oerman-Amerlcan relations," says: j
Discussion ns to whether our diplomacy !
might not have been able to prevent this
Situation avails as nothing. We can only '
take note of the material fact of the ex
istence of a new and important factor in
international Jollcy."
WASHINGTON. Nov. 9.â So far the
State Department has received no official
statement of the agreement between ;
Great Britain and Germany as to Sa- !
moa. However, the officials do not doubt i
the accuracy of the press report.
Hie chief interest of the United Statfs |
in the Samoan archipelago was the pres
ervation of our rights in the harbor of
P&go Pago, a leas,- of which was secured
to us by the treaty of 1878. This did not :
give us any absolute property In the
Islahd. it was provided that It was to
remain In force for ten years from its
date, and was then terminable on twelve
months' notice by either party. By a
similar treaty in the year 1579 "the Ger
man Government had a right to the esÂ»- !
tablishmenl of a naval station in Salua
fata harbor, Island of upolu, and in the â 
year Great Britain acquired the!
right to establish a nuv^l station on the :
shores of a Samoan harbor to be here-'
designated by the British Govern- '
ment. This privilege did not apply to the
harbors of Apia or Saluafata. nor to that ,
part of the harbor of Pago Pago to be |
hereafter selected by the Government of
â  Ited" Stairs as a station under the
treaty with Samoa.
By the arrangement recently made be
tween the Governments of the United
5, Great Britain and Germany the j
United States becomes possessed of all
the Islands of the Samoan group which
lie east pf the one hundred and seventy- '
firs* meridian of longitude. These Islands
comprise Tutuila. where is situated the
harbor of fago Pago, and further oast
Manua, Oloosinga, 0100 and Rose islands.
Outside of Tutuila in this group there is
no harbor and but one anchorage, situ
ated on the northwest side of Mnnua. In j
only one harbor for ships,
tv, exposed at all seasons;

SALOON-KEEPER HELD UP
BY TWO MASKED MEN
Forced Him to Place All His Ready
Cnsh in a Sack and Drove
Away.
COVELO, Nov. 9.â News was brought to
Covelo by the United States mall carrier
of the Overland Stage Company of a bold
hold-up at Usal, forty miles southeast
of here. Michael Freltag, a wealthy sa
loon-keeper of 1 't-al. was banqueting with
a number of his friends when two strang
ers drove up. They alighted and walked
up to the bar as if wishing refreshments.
Freltag stepped in from an adjoining
room to wait upon them, when he noticed
to his dismay that they were masked. In
a muffled voice one demanded his cash
and emphasized the request by covering
him with a revolver. The other desperate
man covered the door of the poker and
banquet room, terrifying the guests with
the careless maneuvers of his pistol.
Freitag was stunned by the unusual oc
curence, but was brought to his senses by
the stern command to be quick about pil
ing up the chsli.
To hurry him up the robber shot at- the
defenseless nun, slightly wounding him
in the left arm. This had the desired ef
fect of making Freitag place all the avail
able cash in the drawer and on the poker
tables In a sack which was handed to him
by one of the highwaymen.. They then
cautiously withdrew, backing away to
v.iird the door and to their buggy and
drove off at a keen clip. The officers of
{'sal, \Vestport and Laytonville are in
pursuit, headed by Deputy Sheriff Steven
son.
The highwaymen are reported headed
for Round Valley and are looked for all
along the line. The hold-up sensation Is
exciting the residents of all the coast and
interior towns in this section. Xo clew
to the Identity of the criminals can bo
obtained. They are apparently strangers.
DEPARTMENT DISTRUSTS
THE SHIPWRIGHTS
Believes That They Were Not Sincere
in Their Offers to Return
to Work.
WASHINGTON 1 , Nov. 9.â The Navy De- J
partment has not as yet completed In
vestigation of the wage scale for Mnrp !
Island Navy-yard. The belief at the de- 1
lent Is that the demand of the ship
wrights for an Increase from $4.20 to $4. R0
per day wap for the purpose of forcing
[he Government to accede to thHr il<?
mands and after half completing th n
work on the Hnrtford to withdraw and.
a? they thought, leave the department in â .
the lurch.
Later three sam>Â» strikers were, bo the ]
department states, willliig to return to j
work at the old rate. The department '
finds, however, that the Btrlke Is more of
a benefit than otherwise, as almost all ,
tlip work at the yard is near completion.
tary Long, who arrived to-day car- j
rled all the papers in the matter to his
residence to-nlxnt, and it is probable that
a decision will be, reached by him to-mor

WASHINGTON, Nov. 9.â The War De- ;
partment definitely located Agulnaldo to
day as on Ills way to the town of Boam
bang.about seventy-five miles northeast of
Tarlac. The recent calculations have been
that the insurgent leader was in thp town
of Bayambang, not far from Tarlac, in :
which case the several forces under Gen
erals Mac Arthur, Lawton, Young and
Wheaton would have had him practically j
surrounded.
There has boon some doubt, however,
as to the name Hayambang.and to-day this
was cleared up by definite information
fixing- Boambang Instead of Hayainbung
as the place 01 Agutnaldo's refuge. A
dispatch from General Otis mentioned
Boambang, and at the same time reliable
information came through other channels
that Lieutenant Gilmore and other
American prisoners were at Boamhang, in
the mountains far to the northeast of
Tarlne.
It is expected that the insurgent capital
will be shifted to Boambang, and the ef
forts of the American military forces uMil
be- directed toward that point. It is in
the mountainous country of tho north,
and apparently out of the fertile and
populous regions, where Aguinaldo thus
far has conducted his operations. It is
said to ho accessible from the south by
way of only one route, along a river
which Is a branch of the Rio Grande.
This leaves the rebel leader little or no
opportunity of communicating with the
coast or getting tn supplies. He has also
left the i allri ad behind.
It Is said at the Wnr Department that
the columns of General Young and Gen
eral Wheaton will push on to the north,
following up the insurgent leader and his
scattered forces

NOT TO BLAME FOR
THE CHILD'S DEATH
Gripman Beggs Exonerated â Testi
mony Showed He Could Not Stop
the Car in Time.
1 Grlpman William Beggs of the Howard
I street car line was exonerated yesterday
; by the Coroner's jury from all blame in
| connection with the death of Lizzie Dun
nigan, the â¢ 17-months-old daughter of
; John Dunnigan of 921^2 Howard street.
i The little girl was jammed under trie
fender of the car last Saturday in front
of the store kept by her mother.
The Dunnigan children- were in the habit
of playing in the street, according to the
statements of the witnesses. The little
girl got on the track so close to the car
that the gripman was unable to stop it
until the child had been pushed under
the fender.
Gripman Bees? testified that he nad
been working for the past ten years as
gripman, and that he does not use intoxi
cating liquor. On the lfith of last March
a child belonging to the same family ran
on - the track in front of the car, and he
stopped the car in time to prevent any
injury to the little one. Last Saturday he
noticed that children were playing: in '.he
street In front of Mrs. Dunnlgan's store.
He saw \he deceased about twenty feet
from the car and about seven feet from
the track, running toward the track.
He was ringing the bell at the time to
warn the other children, and as soon as
he saw Lizzie he put on the brakes with
all his force, .but the rails were slippery
with the mud and the rain and the car
did not stop until the child had been
struck by the fender. :'â ':
HOTEL NYMPHIA
IN FAVOR WITH
THE GRAND JURY
Believe It Should Re
main Open.
The Hotel Xymphia is to receive a
; favorable report from the Grand Jury.
; During a long session held yesterday one
I of the subjects discussed was the notorl
i pus resort and it was the consensus of
opinion among the jurors that it was a
' necessary evil. The decision reached was
i to appoint a committee of jurymen, who
will be instructed to invite a number of
business men and liberal clergy to co
â  operate with it and thoroughly inspect
the place.
There is no dispute among the jurymen
as to the nature of the report that will
', be made. All agree that the recommenda
-1 tion will be that the place should be al
lowed to continue with certain restric
tions. It will also be suggested by the
jury that the city levy a tax on the
Nympnia's business and insist upon the
resort being conducted under rules framed
by the authorities.
Another matter that was under con
sideration was the bringing of an Indict
ment against Oscar Newhaus on a charge
of forgery made by F. Wiltsee, the mil
. lionaire mining man. While the evidence
taken by the jury was positive in Its na
ture It was impossible to get a sufficient
number of the jurymen to vote in favor
; of bringing a true bill against the ac
â  cused. But eleven of the members ex
pressed the belief that Newhaus was
; guilty, while it takes at least twelve to
i decide In favor of indicting. It is openly
charged that some undue influence has
I been brought to bear in the case
The school hoard scnndal was not taken
up at yesterday's meeting, but will be

majority of the jurors are In favor of In

COURAGING REPORTS.
Julian Liebes of the Alaska Explora

"We have received such splendid reports
about the Cape Nome district by the
steamer Homer which arrived yesterday
morning.'" said Julian Liebes last night,
i "that the directors of the Alaska Ex
ploration Company have decided to pur-
I chase at least four passenger steamers to
i meet the exigencies of the situation. We
have been negotiating for lhi.se steamers
in a somewhat perfunctory way, not
knowing of the wonderful possibilities ill
! the new gold district, but the Homer has
j brought such encouraging advices that we
j have definitely placed the orders for th-sc
steamers, which will be first-class in
every respect. They will be of a tyoe
; never seen in Alaska before. We intend
! to nave them heavily sheathed in order
: that they may break through the Ice and
i we expect to have the first, <jnÂ£ on the

there, namely, not later than the first
week In June. - ;
"We learn that the beach at Cape
Nome, which Is about twenty-live miles in
' length, is paying prespectora from $20 a
1 day up. This year there has been taken
I out from $50,000 to $150. by Individual
! workers, who merely stripped the ground
I on Glacier, Anvil. Snow and Sweet Cakes
' creeks, and next season at least three
; times that much will be taken out. There

develop them to the fullest extent. An

j cil City, on Golovir^ Bay, are both ex
j periencing a boom.
; â¢'There is so much gold there that in
our two stores we were positively forced
to the necessity of refusing to lake any
more. Both our safes were full and we

steamers which we recently sent up there

1 $5,00u.000 taken out of Nome district dur-
I ing three months this' year and it Is the

i much will be taken out.
"There were six thousand people In tho
district before the winter *xodns begun

There are two churches in the district,
one Congrayatlonal and the other Pres

i of these churches to be used as a hos

NO TEACHERS DISCHARGED.
School Board Failed to Investigate
Charges Against Pedagogues.
The Board of Education whs to have
met last night to consider incompetency
and kindred charges against a half-dozen
teachers in the department whose qualifi

The board, however, did not meet. Only
Eels, Brandenstein, Gedge and Bergero't
appeared., and, there being no quorum,
an adjournment was taken to next Thurs
day night.
That there will be no quorum next
Thursday is beyond the peradventure of a
doubt. The present board has made itself
popular with the teachers, and has no do
sire to do otherwise at the last moment.
Discharging teachers, for whatever rea
son. is not popular among the pedagogues,
and as the programme is now the board
will pass all such matters over to Its
successor. Â<

IV. GrOUVENEUR MORRIS.
BY JOHN WILLIAM FKRRIN, PH.D.
Gouverneur Morris was one of the most
remarkable and admirable men of revo
lutionary tiir.t-s. If we except Benjamin
Franklin, who really belonged to a
ceding generation, none of his contempo
! rariea possessed bo many rare qualities.
| He was a distinguished statesman, a bril
liant lawyer, an able financier, an orator
of great eloquence, a philosopher and "a
fine gentleman, who had a sharp wit and
a keen sense of humor." He delighted in
the study of men, and in his Intercourse
with them was always self-possessed. He
himself has said that he "never knew the
sensation of fear, inferiority or embar
rassment." He was self-confident in his
opinions; jet James Madison tells us that
he was ever ready to surrender them
when discussion convinced him that they
had been too hastily formed.
Mr. Morris was born in 17'i2 at Morris
ania, in the province of New York. He
wan carefully educated and graduated with
honor at King's (now Columbia) College
in 1765. Then he studied law and was ad
mitted to the bar in 1771. His political
career began almost immediately. When i
GOUVERNEUR MORRIS.
but 23 years old he became a member of j
the Provincial Congress of New York, j
where hfs great abilities, prodigious in
dustry and competence !n law and politics |
soon gave him an enviable reputation. The i
extent of his knowledge of finance, in
which he was already an expert, was a
surprise to his associates. As early aa \
IT6SI he hail published anonymously -an j
able series of articles on this subject that j
had been widely read. Now the confidence
reposed in him by the Congress enabled
him to devise wars and moans for de- â¢
fraying the expenses of military opera
tions. In May, 1776, the Continental Con- ,
press advised the colonies to organize new
form= of government. Morris took the
lend in the debates that followed in the j
New York Congress, and in iha following
August, when the State constitution was i
made, he was a member of the commit- \
tee that drafted It.
He was elected to the Continental Con
gress In 1778. His reputation for business
capacity led Congress to honor htm on
the very day he presented his credentials
with mi appointment on a committee to
examine with General Washington into
the condition of the army. The result
was the preparation of a plan for the re
organization of the army. It was while
he was a member of this committee that
the intimate ami lifelong: friendship ex
isting between him and Washington be
gan. In the next February he was made
chairman of a committee of five "to con
sider and report" upon propositions sub
mitted by Lord North for a reconcilia
tion. In these propositions the English
Government agreed to abandon the old
and vexed question of taxation and to
send commissioners to treat with the colo
nists. The report was written by Morris
and was unanimously accepted by Con
gress. It declared that the United States
could not treat with Great Britain until
the British military and naval forces were
withdrawn and indrpender.ee recognized.
In this way the principle on which peace
was to be negotiated was determined, and
when the United States finally appointed
commissioners It was Morris who drafted
their instructions.
Mr. Morris was not returned to Con
gress when his term expired. His defeat
was due primarily to the accusation that
he had sacrificed the interests of nis
State for those of the General Govern
ment. He now took up his residence in
Philadelphia and resumed the practice of j
law. He did not remain long at the law,
however, for his intimate knowledge of
finance led Robert Morris, the Superin
tendent of Finance, to appoint him as nis
assistant. Now ho planned the first bank
of the country, which Congress incorp
orate! as the "Bank of North America,"
with a capital of 5400.000. While in this
Office, too, if Thomas Jefferson is right,
he suggested the idea of decimal nota
tion, which afterword was made the basis
of the coinage of the United States.
When the war was over he' retired to pri
vate life and again took up the practice
of law.
The Federal convention assembled May
25, 17*7. Mr. Morris had now resided In
Philadelphia for seven years, and was j
chosen as one of the delegates from Perm- j
sylvania, lie attended the whole session
except a few days in June, and entered :
with his usual zeal into the work of the :
convention. He was opposed to a de
mocracy. Probably he went farther in j
his opposition to this form of government '
than any other delegate except Hamilton,
with many of whose views he was strik
ingly in accord. He .-ought to establish a ;
vigorous central government. Ho favored
a President and a Senate for life and a |
hold suffrage. He opposed slavery
and denounced the system as a "nefarious
institution, the curse of heaven on all .ne |
States' in which It prevails."
It was .Mr. Morris who made the final
draft of the constitution. James Madison
lias said: â¢'The finish given to the. style
and arrangement of the constitution
fairly belongs to the pen of Mr. Morris.
A better choice could not have been made,
as the performance of the task proved.'
The talent and taste of the author were
stamped on the face of it." While the
constitution did not meet with Mr. Mor
ris' approval in all respects, he neverthe
less believed in it. A little time after the
convention bad adjourned he wrote as
follows to a gentleman in France:
Ycu will ere this have seen the constitution
proposed for the United States. 1 have many
reasons to believe that it was t,he work of plain
honest men, and such, I think. It will appear'
Faulty it must be, for what is jfcrfect? Should
it lake effect, the affairs of this country will
put on a much better aspect than they have
â jet worn, and America will soon be as much
respected abroad as she has for some time past
been disregarded.
In the struggle that followed in the
States over the ratification Hamilton in
vited Morris to become one of the writers
of the Federalist papers. His correspond
ence does not explain why he did not
accept this invitation and thus connect
his name with those famous publications;
it docs make clear, however, that it was
not from lack of Interest in the result.
Morris spent m si of the winter of
1787-88 in Virginia superintending mer
cantile affairs in which he was â¢ gaged
with Robert Morris. The next year these
interests took him to France. He sailed
from Philadelphia December 18 and
reached Paris on February 3. He soon
became a favorite in the salons of Paris.
The revolution was now at hand, and
through his connection with Lafayette he
came into contact with the revolutionary
leaders. At first sight Talleyrand im
pressed him as a "sly, cool, cunning, am
bitious man." He quickly discerned that
the weakness of the Abbe Sieyes was his
egotism. He tells us the Abbe descanted
"with much self-sufficiency on govern
ment, despising all that had been said
or sung on. the subject before him." He
regarded Mirabeau as "the most unprin
cipled scoundrel that ever lived," and
thought, that M. Necker was without the
talent of a great minister. He declared
that Necker's financial writings "teem
with that sort of sensibility which makes
â HHHHHHHHfI tno fortune of mod
lt.'r:i romances." 'He
â did justice, however,
â  ; Mirabeau's great
H;i!'iiiti'-s. and gave
IN' i k> r much credit
Hi'"i' serving "at his
â  own expense in an
â oi'ice which others
l&rck for the purpose
â "> enriching them
â st.ives." If Morris'
â jiiiignH.-nt.s are not
â always profound,
â they are at least in
â ter< ting and nearly
â J;>l^a\>- instructive.

ington appointed him Minister to France.
He held this office til! August, 1794, when
he was succeeded by James Monroe.
The latter years of Mr. Morris" life were
as useful as his earlier career. - fter his
recall from Paris he made an extensive
tour throughout Europe. He visited the
various capitals and made many valu
able acquaintances with statesmen ai.l
other distinguished men. While in
Vienna he made strenuous efforts tor the
release of Lafayette, who was then con
fined in the fortress of Olmutz. Latfe in
the year 179S he returned to the United
States. /He had been absent ten years,
and he was received, he says, s if he
were "not an unwelcome guest in his
native country." Soon after his return
a vacancy occurred in the United States
Senate from New York ' and lie was
elected to nil it. His term extended from
May 3, 1800, to March 4. 1803. When Jef
ferson became President Morris went to
Washington "'determined to support the
administration" if he could do so
honestly." But Jefferson's message dis
pleased him; convinced that the Presi
dent's purpose was "the destruction of
the General Government." he united with
the Federalists, The Democrats were es
pecially hostile to the Federal courts, and
in the session of ISOI-1802 they determined
to peal the judiciary act. A motion for
this purpose was made in the Senate on
the Sth of January. Morris made two
speeches against itâ one on the day it was
introduced and the other six days later.
For the remainder of the sessio.i he
worked diligently on- various Senate bids.
He opposed the repeal of the internal
taxes, and "labored hard over the proper
steps to be taken respecting the repeal
of the judiciary.'' In the next Congress
he favored the purchase of Louis
and save this measure of the administra
tion his support.
When his term in the Senate expired
he retired to Morrisartia. For the re
mainder of his life he occupied himself
In agriculture and in the management of
his ample fortune. He still retained',
however, a lively interest in public af
fairs, and when New York's great canal
project was proposed he became one of
its most active advocates. In 1810 the
State Legislature appointed seven com
missioners to explore the proposed route.
Morris was a member of the commission;
he was elected its chairman, and held
the office till his death. Late 'n his life
he was married to Anne Gary Randolph.
The ceremony took place at Morrisania
on Christmas day, 1909. Mr Morris lived
but seven years longer. He died Novem
ber 6, 1816. at the age of 64. It is -aid
that on the day -of his death le asked
concerning the weather; when he was
told that the day was beautiful ms mind,
like Daniel Webster's, turned to Gray's
"Elegy," and he replied: "A .-â¢eaut.'.ful
day, yes, but
"Who, to dumb forgetfulness a prey.
Thin pleasing, anxious being e'er resigned.
Left the warm precincts of the cheerful day.
Nor cast one longing, llng'ring look behind?"

The Hay Market.
The circular of Somers & r*n. fpits of Hay:
"Receirts of Hay for the past week amount
to pomething less than 3000 tons, somewhat
more than for the week preceding. Damaged
Hay still continues to arrive quite freely an.l
sells it about th( tame price as before. The
demand for good, sound Hay 13 quite brisk,
a: d because of this the warehoused are being
broken Into Quite freely In order to supply
the demand.
â¢â¢Or. all this Hay there Is extra expense In
the way of storage. Insurance, etc., and must
be sold here for at least enough to pay this
expense. Other than this advance we note no
change In prices. It would be almost Impos
sible for prices to advance materially, for If
such a thing should liappen immediately ship
ments would become very heavy and in all
probability prices would drop back again.
"The demand In the country for cars for the
shipment of produce has lessened somewhat:
thus we note the arrivals of Hay by rail are
somewhat heavier than they have been for
several weeks past.
"Arrivals of Alfalfa during the week have
been quite light, only about 400 tons corning
In. Quite a little of this was damaged and
Eold for low figures, hut the sound Hay went
very easily and at good ; rices We think
that a cargo of choice Alfalfa In good, sound
condition would bring ?? per ton on our mar
ket to-day. The demand for sound -Alfalfa
!s very good, but It Is with much difficulty
that the wet and damaged Hay Is worked off."
New York Money Market.
SAID TO BE HAMTERED BY LAWS CON
TROLLING THE LEGAL RESERVES.
The New York* circular of Henry Clews says:
â¢ "nankin? opinion very generally Inclines to
the conclusion that the fall return to ease
will bo much later this season than In ordinary
ye.-irs. From such symptoms as are In slffht
bankers doing an Interior business are expect
ing little lending below 6 per cent between
now and the flrFt of January- Unusual causes
are at work in the money market.' the breadth
and for<-e of which It Is not easy to measure.
Fomethlns more than the movements Incident
to this crop seas have to be calculated upon.
Crodlt operations have been radically influenced
by the industrial revolution incidental to the
great trust creations of the last tan months.
Since January 1 corpo rations with a total of
no less than }2,000,000,000 of capital Issues have
been organized. D â â¢â  transformations have
V.i?en attended with Immense temporary dislo
cations of capital. The negotiations have In
volved large loans destined" to run until the
new Issues have been distributed and until
the underwriters have effected their liquida
tions. The national banks have doubtless par
ticipated to but a very small extent In these
operations: but many of the trust companies,
private bankers and other financial Institutions
have probably made advances to the extÂ«*nt
of hundreds of millions of dollars, with the
consequence that these credit resources are
lorKfly withheld from uses to which they or
dinarily contribute at thin season of the year.
In addition to this special employment of
credit the. demand for the ordinary purposes
of business has far surpassed all precedent.
The extraordinary development Id. our manu
factures, our farming, our mining and our ex
porla has placed an extraordinary pressure
upon the credit resources of the country.
There is a" limit to the extent to which this
sudden vast expansion of our credit require
ments can be promptly ponded to. It is
not merely that we have no power to expand
our currency proportionately to these enlarged
wants. Restriction falls equally upon the much
larger clr.ss of credit operations that are car
ried on without the employment of moneyâ '
the ordinary loans and discounts of the banks,
which are placed under sharp limitations by
the banking laws. The ability of the banks
to lend is regulated by the amount of lawful
money they can control as reserve against their
df-poslts; and yet the activity of the retail
trad" and the Increased requirements for pay
ment of wages are keeping the greenbacks
and gold in active circulation outside the
banks. Had we an elastic bank currency sys
tem, which would enable the banks to dis
tribute their notes under conditions like these
instead of paying out their reserve money we
ehould have a twofold source of relief which
we have not now ln the first place a. larger
resource of retail circulation and In the next
p!a.-<Â» a larger ability of the banks to discount.
It '.bus appears that the prevailing stringency
la due, more than anything else, to the legal
mitrictions. upon banking operations and to
tln> artificial regulation of our currency sys
tem. How far the Injury from these restraints
Will be further developed under the present
conditions It Is difficult to definitely Indicate.
It seems only too possible that some Interests
ji.ay suffer which, under freer conditions,
might safely and properly be accommodated.
The nature and causes of the stringency are
not suggestive of early relief and make urgent
uppea! to Congress for the earnest considera
tion of these credit and currency questions."

EASTERN MARKETS
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Nov. 9.â A general disposition
to liquidate In speculative holdings whs mani
fest In the stock market to-day. Early in the
day strength was manifested which was due
primarily to the hisher quotations cabled from
London, an.l which was aided by strength In
special stocks, but the growing: stiffness of
money and the total absence of any outside
buying demand discouraged the bull element
and they were Kellers of the whole list as the
day advanced. The weakness of slocks was
very well distributed, except for the tpeeial
collapse in Leather, and affected all depart
ments of the list. The declines in industrials
and in the specialties are rather greater, be
cause the commitments for the long accounts
In those stocks were larger. There was heavy
. Eelllng throughout the railroad list, and a large
number of prominent stocks in that depart
ment show immediate declines of a noint or
upward. In the special the average runs
between 1 and 2 points in the leading stocks.
An execution should be made of the iron and
steel stocks, several of which offered rood re
sistance to decline. Steel and Wire and Ameri
can Hoop were examples. Attention was al
most wholly centered in the money market out
look. The continuing demands on the New j
, York banks are regarded as foreshadowing a '
still further decrease in the propurtion ol cash
reserves in the next bank statement. The em
phatic utterances of the Treasury officials
against any further measures of relief by the
Government dissipated the hopes that were
prevalent In Wall street yesterday. As the
banks have lost already to the Bub-Treasury
â¢ thing like $3,000,000 since last Friday, the
attitude of the trade is Important. Shipments
by the New York banks to their interiur cor
resoondents ore reported to be on as large a
scale as last week. New York exchange at Chi
cago fell again to-day to 10 cents discount,
compared with 10 cents premium at the open-
Ing of the week. The continued expansion in
the Interior need for money and the absorption
by the Treasury by means of the surplus In the
revenues is met by the calling in of loans
placed In the stock market on stock collateral.
There was a sharp fall In sterling exchange
to-day partly due to the firmer local money
market and partly to an Increased supply of
cotton bills, which are now coming forward in
larger volume. But the weekly statement of
the Bank of England phowing a progressive
decline In the proportion of reserve to liability
precludes the hope of relief from that quarter.
The recuperation shown by the Bank of France
In Its weekly statement relieves apprehension
of the immediate rise In that Institution's rate
i of discount, but this is small palliation for
, the generally hardening tendency of the world's
money market. ThÂ» closing of the stock mar
i ket was easy and near the low price of the day
â  for most stocks. An Incident of the day was
I he demand for silver certificates at a sharp
advance.
The bond market was weak In sympathy with
stocks. Total sales. par value, 12.530,000.

Chicago Grain Market.
\ CHICAGO, Nov. 9.-The weakness of Liver
pool was the paramount factor in the open-
Ing of wheat. Initial prices were unchanged
from yesterday's close. December at 6S l i' 368 I sio |
] and May at 72% c, but sellers were In the ma- j
1 jority and the price eased off to 87%0 for De-
I cember and 71Mi72c tor May. Shorts and those
: trying to protect puts got into action at these j
figures and their buying forced an advance, j
December climbing to SB%c and May to rzc.
The Increase in stocks and the lack of foreign
demand added to the Influence of Liverpool
: were too much for the market to hold up
i under, however. Liquidation became quite ,
i general and the price sagged to a point lower
: than at any time during the present decline.
December slumped to G7V"'"-\c and May to
71% c Late In the session the strength of corn
and good export engagements at New lorK
brought better support to the market. At tne
bottom figures shorts became active buyers ana
December advanced to 68%@68%C and May to
72c bid. at which it closed.
Trading during most of the day was with
-1 out animation. Statistics were generally bear
ish. The Price Current said winter wheat was
; doing well; although Ohio and Michigan re- :
ported some Inroads made by the Hessian n>. j
! Com held Its own well throughout the scs
i sion, save for a little weakness With wheat at
i the opening. The bull feature was the ab
i sence of country offerings. December closed
at 31>4ir-SlHc. May closed at 82% c asked.
Sympathy with corn and some buying; by
; shorts held oats firm. December closed at ZZVt
i Provisions-Hogs at the yards were 6 cents
, higher, a fact to which was due the strength
: in provisions. Trading was extremely dull and
fluctuations were within a narow range, me
close was a a gain Â«if 2Â»ic all around.

SUFFRAGE THE
PATHWAY T O A
HIGHER LIFE
Mrs. Catt Argues on
New Lines.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Nov. 9.
Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, chairman of
the National Organization of Women's
Buffragists, addressed a large audience
to-night ih the First Unitarian Church.
The edifice was decorated with potted
palms and flowers to receive the speaker
and the coterie of notable women who
had seats on the platform during her dis
course. Mrs. Catt made as a strong ar
gument for the giving of the ballot to
women the Idea of cross inheritance. She
Eaid in part, after having been Introduced
by the Rev. J. K. McLean:
"It was once thought that children In
herited all their qualities from their fath
er. -Their- mother was credited with hav
ing given .thorn life but not tenderness of
a moral, spiritual or intellectual charac
. ter. '.This was many years ago. A change
came when. a distinguished German sci- |
entist discovered that boys inherit ten- I
dencies chit-fly from their mother, and
girls Inherit from their father. And this
â will be found to be true In the vast ma
jority of cases.
"I a-sk thenâ if this be accepted by sci
entists and intelligent people generally â
the .fact that motherhood mean* a great
deal -more to children than mere mother
hood in the. physical sense, why we should
not give to women all the educational
and political advantages given to man?
Why not give to her the responsibilities
that will develop her that she in turn
may impart strength of character and
purity of purpose to her sons?
"In looking forward to greater progress
along all lines wo must realize that that !
progress will be made only as men and
women rise together. We must have a
grr-aW-r.' motherhood and we must have
a greater Fatherhood. Then there will
rise a great ice. Advance wfll mean
greater welfare and greater welfare will
come through the ballot, since the better
ment of the nation, its stability and Its
H.ifeguajd, Is the main function and pur
pose-of the ballot. The ballot is the na
tion's best weapon. It should be in the
i miff of every citizen."
Mrs. Catt reviewed history briefly in
her introduction, pointing out that while
a\\ tjie other centuries have been marked
by militarism, this, the nineteenth, is
noted for its industrial progress. This
progress has meant the putting of women
into business life. And the going of
wirhen from the home to the factory, the
office, .the school and the platform has
been the result of "man's invasion of
woman's territory," In, for instance, the
making of cloths by machinery, where
spinning and weaving at home once pre
vailed; and that women have not invaded
man's territory.
She grave a clever humorous history of
woman's progress in intellectual advan
tages, alluding to the time between J7 V 9
and 1^22 when girls were not permitted in
the public schools.
"The platform privilege came later,"
went on Mrs. Catt. "At lirst women were
m*>t with mobs and bad eggs when they
mounted the platform. But later thing's
changed. Lucy Stone told me that she
was met by mobs and eggs, but that the
eggs were good ones. So you can see by
this thnt public opinion had undergone a
delicate change in favor of woman's
lights."
Miss Hay gave a short address follow
ing Mrs. Catt, but it was of a more local
and fiscal character. On the platform
with the speakers were Mrs. John F.
Swift, president of the California State
Suffrage Union; Mrs. Lloyd Baldwin,
president of the Alamerta County I'nlon;
Mrs. Emma Shafter Howard, Mrs. J. c.
Waymire, Mrs. C. L. Wood, Mrs. M.
Chapman. Mrs. William Keith, Mrs. J. C.
Campbell, Mrs. M. S. Kcene, Miss Carrie
A Whelan and Mrs. McClees.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 10, 1899.
WAITING FOR A
CALL FOR AN
EXTRA SESSION
Alamedans Expected
It Yesterday.
Oakland Office San Francisco nail,
908 Broadway, November 9.
Many members of the Alameda County
Legislative delegation wore disappointed ;
to-day. They firmly expected to hnve |
heen ordered to convene at special see- '
slon in Sacramento next Monday for the ]
purpose of electing Colonel Burns to the
United States Senate and for such other J
business as the Governor might dictate.
But the sprvlal call did not conic, al
though the politicians gathered in little
knots on Broadway to discuss the expect
ed summons. For the first time in I
months Assemblyman Joe Kelly was In i
evidence, and he said he had heard hat
the call was to be issued the day after
the San Francisco election, but that so
far hÂ» knew nothing of it.
Senator Leavltt was asked if four days
would not be too short a notice in which '
to convene the Legislature, and Baid he j
did not think it would. "1 heard the '
rumor," said he, "that Governor Gage
was about to form an extra session, but
how true it is 1 know not. Although a
friend of Colonel Burns, 1 cannot say that i
1 am any better informed on this special ,
session matter than anybody else. It
would not surprise me if one were called. ;
and to be truthful. I expect that one will '
be called in time to handle the Senatorial
question before the meeting of Congress.
The Governor, under the constitution,
does not need to give any particular
length of time in which to get ready for
a special session. The constitution pro
vides that a special session shall bo called
whenever Important business of an
emergency requires it, and, for instance,
if it should be Decessary to call a Bpecial
session for any particular purpose In time
of war. no time could be wasted. There
fore tho matter Is left to the Governor's
discretion, and If he should issue a call
to-day he would not legally have to give
a longer Interval than would be neces-
Bary for the most distant legislator to
reach the capital after being told of the
Governor's intention."
The local Senatorial question is also in
teresting the active politicians, and all
are greed that the situation has simmered
down to one pomt â that the nest Senat >r
to succeed Senator St ration will be a man
favorable to United States Senator Per
kins In 1902. As that is the year for a
Gubernatorial election, it is plain that
Stratton's successor will be named by
either Dr. Pardee or Senator Perkins, or
both, presumably both. Although Super
visorial and Assembly combinations will
i :t a little figure in this particular
the larger questions of Governor and
United States Senator will entirely over
shadow the smaller matters.

TRIED TO MURDER A
WOMAN FOR HER MONEY
THOMAS JONES, who gives his occupation as a longshoreman, attempted
to murder Otllia Reias with a pair of shears in a house of ill repute at
11 I'lnckney place late yesterday afternoon. His motive, according to
his victim's statement, was robbery. The woman, who is Spanish, re
ceived several severe Jabs from the sharp weapon, badly shattering the bones
of the nose. Before Jones could finish his dastardly work help came and
he was taken to the California street police station, where he was booked
for assault to murder.
Jones came Into the room occupied by the woman, and after locking the
door demanded money. Upon being refused, the woman says, he declared he
would take her life, and seizing a long pair of shears with one hand grasped
her throat with the other. He then directed several stabs at her face, nearly
tearing off her nose. By this time the Keias woman had succeeded in turn
ing the key in the door, and several other inmates of the house -who had been
summoned by her screams rushed In. Jones then sought to escape, but was
held by several other women until the arrival of Officer J. F. O'Brien and
Special Officer Otip Burge, who took him to the police station.
JoneÃ was not drunk when he committed the act. but after spending a few
hours In the tanks feigned intoxication and disclaimed any knowledge of
the affair.
ALAMEDA COUNTY
BURGLARS NOT
IN FAVOR OF A
NEW CHARTER
Present System AH
They Desire.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Nov. 9.
While burglars are at large and hlgh
waymen are snapping their fingers at ef
forts \<< catch them, and while dozens of
desperate criminals are swelling the psc
ords for arrests by being taken in fur rid
ing to the High School on a bicycle with
out a bell, or for making cuspidors of the
sidewalks, the Police Department Is rent
in about three sections, any two of which
is working earnestly against the third.
For the past three months nothing has
been done in the Police Department but
politics, and the present condition of the
Police Commission is solely responsible
fur the situation.
The men who are supposed to be lead
ing these various sections are not to
biame. Bach one is ambitious and each
is fully cognizant of the fact that If he
nigh politics he can, under the
present charter, gain his point and do up
the other fellow. Merit and good be
havior count for nothingâ the politician Is
the successful man on the force. So thor
oughly is this recognized that there are
many men In the department who make
no secret of boasting of their contempt
for certain of thHr superiors. The con
stitution of the Board of "Works is such
that all three members are of necessity
active politicians and a little more pres
sure brought on any one of the three
members can turn the Police Department
upside down or Inside out at a single
meeting called at an hour's notice.
Under these conditions nothing else can
bo expected than that which now prevails.
Members are making secret reports to
their favorite Commissioners, ignoring
their superiors and t"'i;.'iiiK their knees to
curry favor. Chief of Police tiodgklns Is
doing his best under the circumstances,
but with such internecine troubles he can
not do what Is expected of him. Captain
Peterson is conscientiously trying to hold
up his end. but there are men on his
watch who an not In sympathy with him
and who to a certain extent tie his hands.
The day watch, under Captain Wilson, is
no more harmonious and it Is even said
that an officer a few nights ago actually
four Buspected robbers within his
grasp, but let them go on a very flimsy
explanation given by them.
All agree thai thorp can be no Improve
ment till t: â  re Is a charter that will take
the department out of politics.

VESSEL BURNED
AT ANCHOR IN
OAKLAND CREEK
Schooner Kadiak Is
Badly Damaged.
AL.AMEDA, Nov. 9.â The schooner Ka
diak of the Alaska Commercial Com
pany's'fleet was nearly destroyed by tire
this morning in Oakland Creek, oft Hay
& Wright's ship yards. The vessel ar
rived from Alaska last week and after
discharging was taken to the Oakland
harbor to remain during the winter.
Shortly after the men at the ship yards
reported for duty this morning Mr.
Wright noticed smoke issuing from the
Kadiak's forecastle. From a hasty Inves
tigation it was found that the whole in
terior of the chip was in flames. A
bucket brigade was organized and went
out to the vessel in small boats. By he
roic work the fire was kept in check until
the arrival of some of the apparatus of
the Alameda Fire Department, which hail
been summoned by telephone.
â  A line of hose was carried from the
ship yard wharf to the ship by means
Of several rowboats which were lashed
together and the hold of the Kadiak was
flooded and the flames extinguished. The
damage to the ship is considerable. Her
forecastle is gutted and her nose is
burned away. The decks were cut up ny
the axes of the firemen and many of the
timbers of the after hold are charred and
will have to be replaced. Had it not been
for the prompt action of the employes
of the ship yards the Kadiak would have
been burned to the water's edge and
would have become a total loss. SI c was
in charge of Hay & Wright at the t! r.e
undergoing repairs and there was no
watchman aboard. It Its believed that the
fire was due to spontaneous combustion
of rags and refuse that had been left in
the paint chest.
JOSEPH MARISTANY DOES
NOT WANT TO DIE ALONE
OAKLAND, Nov. 9.â Determined not to
live through his declining years in soi(
tude and loneliness and notwithstanding
his third matrimonial experience proved
exceptionally stormy -and disastrous finan
cially, Joseph MariÃtany, aged 12 years,
and reputed at one time to be one cf the
wealthiest property owners in Alumedu,
was to-night quietly married for the
fourth time. Annette Freimann, aged 42
years, and perhaps more familiarly known
as Mine. liarbidge, being the bride this
time.
The marriage, which will create 'inl
versal surprise, was solemnized at the
home of the bride and groom, corner of
Alameda avenue and Oak street, in the
Kncinal city, shortly after S o'clock this
evening, Rev. W. 11. Fulton, pastor of the
United Presbyterian Church of that city,
oifiriating. The affair was unostentatious,
only a very few close friends being in
formed and invited.
Barely four weeks ago Mine. Harbldge
took a year's lease on the two-story build
ing at Alameda avenue and Oak street,
owned by Marlstany, and opened in it
the Alameda ladles' cloak and suit par
lors, removing from San Francisco. The
upper story was fitted out as living rooms
at a considerable expense, defrayed by
Maristany, who incidentaJly retained or
rented one of these rooms from Ainu-.
Harbidge for himself. The new tenant's
cloak and suit business seemed to llourish
and Maristany soon found himself com
missioned as a special messenger and
buyer of silk goods for the madaxne.
Suspicion was aroused to-day when
Maristany. In rather an excited frame of
mind, called upon several Alameda mln-
Isters, among them Rev. W. W. Scudder
of the First Congregational Church and
Rev. F. S. Brush of the First Presbyterian
Church, asking them to officiate at his
marriape. Scudder and Brush had prt >-t-
OUB origagf-nvrHs and Rev. Mr. Fulton
was recommended and secured. Late this
afternoon Mr. Maristany called with a
friend at the County Clerk's office and
took out the marriage license. His ?\ge
and that of Mme. Harbidge was given as
above, his nativity Spain and hers Jn
dlana. He was solicitous that the strict
est secrecy be observed. He is well
known on both sides of the bay and did
not wish his acquaintances to learn of his
latest matrimonial step.
"I am fretting old now," he said, "r.nd
don't propose to pass my remaining days
in singleness, without a friend or rela
tive to care for me should I become si-'k
and infirm. It's nobody's business out
our own."
The aged groom's previous marriage re
sulted in a sensational divorce. Ho had
married Mabel S. Sperry, an accomplished
young -woman said to be well connected
in the East. Their married life provsd
short and stormy, and finally about three
years ago, after a sensational trial, in
volving valuable property rights. Mabel
B. Maristany was granted a decree of di
vorce, together with several houses and
lots and not less than $25,000. Maristnriy
at the time claimed that as a precaution
'in the event of the death of himself or
â wife he had had executed two sets of
deeds to his property, one conveying from
him to her. the other from her to him,
the survivor to record the deeds wherein
he or she was named as grantee; and that
the wife, after their troubles began,
proved very much nlive by recording her
deeds. The' court, however, awarded her
the property, she having established that
it was giver her as a Christmas present.

OLD SHOTGUN
SHELL PROVED
BAD PLAYTHING
Leo Lynch Severely
Burned.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. Nov. 9.
An old shotgun shell left carelessly ;y
--ing about In a back yard is responsible
for the eerious injuries sustained last
evening by Leo Lynch, the six-year-old
son of John Lynch, employed in the otllce
Of the Commissioner of Immigration in
San Francisco.
The boy had found the shell, cut it
open and set tire to it, when th â¢ powd'-r
flashed, setting his clothes on fire,
destroying hi? long locks of hair ami
burning him seriously about the face and
hands. His eyelashes were serred and
bis tongue did not escape the heat of. the
flames.
The littles fellow's agonizing .creams
brought his mother and sister out into the
back yard, and to their prompt action
and BUCC9M in extinguishing the names
Is due the fact that the child was not
burned to death.
The lad, unconscious, was carried 'nto
the house and Dr. William Kergan sum
moned. The burns about the eyes were
found to be particularly serious. It is
feared that the eyesight has been im
paired, but the real extent of the in

LACK ADEQUATE
COALING PUCES
Serious Condition for
Our Warships.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 9.â The urgent
necessity of adequate coaling stations for
our warships is dwelt on by Rear Admiral
Bradford, Chief of the Naval Bureau of
Equipment, in his report to the Secretary
Of the Navy. He relates the difficulties
encountered during the war with Spain
in securing coal, transporting it and get
ting it aboard the ships. While these ef
forts were successful, the admiral says:
It was due almost entirely to the near prox
imity of the theater of war to our own oo:\st.
Admiral Bradford says that a United states
llr.-t. it called iil'"n to ;i<'t at any point across
the Atlantic, must encounter even greater diffi
culties thnn were found by Ailmiral Cervera.
As a matter ol fact (continued Admiral Brad
ford), it may be stated without fear of contra
diction that at present it would be impossible
for a United Stutes fleet to carry oft active op
erations ihiriiif? Â» w;ir anywhere about the coast
ef Europe, Africa, a large portion of Asia, and
s.-.uth America, for want 01 coal. This; country
has assumed a position of j?reat responsibility
In connection with the maintenance of the sov
ereignty in the territory of the Smith American
republics agHln?t any aggression on the part of
;Â» European nation; yet there in not a single
port where coal or supplies may be obtained in
time ..f wiir by a Tuited States ship anywhere
on the eastern er western coast of South Amer
ica, In the West Indies and the Pacific I tcean
we are somewhat better off. It is of paramount
importance to establish a coal depot on each
Bide of the J?thmus of Panama, near the ter
mini of the Isthmian (.'anal.
The report says under "strategic posi
tions" a coaling station should be estab
lished near the Yucatan Passage, the
Windward Passage, Mona Pasage and
Virgin Passage, all being important stra
tegic locations. The importance of a coal
ing station on each side of the Isthmus
of Panama cannot be overestimated.
Guam, it is stated, probably will In the
near future be a cable station, and it is
?roposed to store 10,000 tons of coal there,
n the survey of the Pacific cable route
twn huge obstacles were encounteredâ one
a sub-marine mountain, lying between the
Midway Islands and Guam, and the sec
ond, the deepest sub-marine abyss yet
found in the world, about 500 miles east of
Guam, and sinking more than 1900
fathoms. The soundings from Honolulu
to Luzon have shown the route to be en
tirely practicable. A branch will run
from Guam to Japan.
CYCLEWAY BEGUN.
First Concrete Piers Placed 2-Tear
Raymond Hill.
PASADENA. Nov. 9.â The first concrete
piers for the California cycleway between
this city and Los Angeles were placed
yesterday at Glenarm street, near Ray
mond Hill. This means that active work
hns been begun on the superstructure of
Th*' tirst enterprise of this kind in the
world, it Is very certain that others of
the kind will be built in other sections.
for President Dobbins, the promoter of
the concern, is in constant receipt of in
quiries on the subject from persons who
In mind building elsewhere. They
often drop their plans, however, when
they learn that a special act of the Legis
lature is necessary to put the thing
through. Two hundred and eighty thou
sand feet of lumber has arrived and a
large force of men Is busy unloading it at
various spurs. The tirwt was unloaded
yesterday. Next week the pillars will be
set on the new piers and the structure
will loom into the air.
It consists of an elevated wooden path.
! with asphalt, Btained with creo-
Bate, walled by screenâ the path being
wide eneugh to permit four cyclists to
ride abreast. The work will now be
pushed verj rapidly. A steam sawmill
was purchased yesterday and will be set
up at Glenann street this week. All the
lumber will !'â â¢ i:u: and fitted by this mill
and all the holes will be bored by Its
power. The paint for the structure hns
arrived, and as fast as the bents are put
together they will be painte.i or stained.
Within two weeks people can see wh.it an
elevated cycleway is like, and the pro
moter is confident that by the first of the
year, when the annual tournament of
rosr-s takes place, a mile of cycleway
from Raymond Hill to town will be in
operation. A portable derrick will help
build the path at the rate of 300 feet a
day from now on.
Fitch Convictetd.
REDDING, Nov. 9.â George A. Fitch,
who has been on trial for the past week
fur assault with a deadly weapon with ln
tent to commit murder, was this evening

with a deadly weapon. The jury recom
mended men-y on the part of the court.
Sentence will be pronounced later. On
October 27. 1898, Fitch and Howard Shoe

road, quarreled over toll charges. A shot
gun in Fitch's hand was discharged,

Fitch pays the weapon was accidentally
discharged. Ills first trial resulted in a
hung jury, standing 9 to 3 in favor of
conviction.

MAJOR GENERAL NELSON A. MILES, WHO IS NOW
OUR GUEST.
MAJOR GENERAL NELSON A. MILES, accompanied by his wife and
daughter, his niece. Miss Hoyt, his aid de camp, Colonel Mlchler and
B. Frank Hall of Philadelphia, arrived In this city last evening on the
train from Portland, Oregon, and Is now at the Palace Hotel, "where he
will remain until Monday or Tuesday next.
General Miles Is here on a tour of Inspection, which embraces all the
principal military posts of the West. He has Just completed an Inspection
of the defenses at the mouth of the Columbia River, and after visiting the
Presidio and the fortifications on the different Islands in the bay. he will
leave to look at the works at San Diego and return thence to Washington via
New Orleans.
The general was met on his arrival here by Colonel Maus and Captain
Wilson pt General Shafter's staff, who extended to the distinguished soldier
the usual courtesies. To-day will be spent In the Inspection of Angel Island,
Alcatraz and the different military posts about the bay, and to-morrow the
general will visit the Presidio, look at the new defenses where the high
power guns have been recently mounted, give his attention to the camps, bar
racks, and in fact to everything pertaining to the discipline, comfort and
efficiency of the troops now there and will finish the day by reviewing all the
soldiers, volunteers and regulars, who are either stationed at the Presidio,
staying there en route to the Philippines or on their way to their homes
after having done their share of campaigning amid the fever Infested
swamps of Luzon.
When seen at his hotel last night the general positively refused to pass
any' criticism on the campaign In the Philippines or on the probability of
General Otis being relieved by General Merrltt or some" other officer. In re
gard to the probability of the new volunteer regiments being eventually
mustered Into the regular army the general said that In his opinion such
would not be the case. These new regiments were merely raised to meet an
emergency and when the emergency had disappeared the regiments would
disappear with It He said that he could not exactly say what Wies the new
army reorganization would take, but he did not think that the regiments
now on their way to the Philippines would be maintained after their term of
enlistment had expired. This does away with the hope of getting into the
regular army for many of the new officers who have been figuring on even
tually enjoying the prestige that Is supposed to go with the uniform of the
regular.
In a recent speech the general said that peace in the Philippines was pos
sible under certain circumstances. When asked last evening what these cir
cumstances were he declined to answer, saying that he preferred to say
nothing more on that matter.
To-night the Loyal Legion will give a reception and supper at the Occi
dental Hotel, at which General Miles will be the guest of honor. Nearly all
the army and nary officers In or near the city are expected to attend and the
result will be one of the largest military entertainments that has ever taken
place in San Francisco.

vestigation the detectives suspected Bal
lard and they concluded to watch him.
Last evening he was seen to enter an
auction house on Kearnv street, near
Pine, and offer for sale some diamoi da
which he had stolen. The detectives,
after waiting until he had concluded tne
bargain, entered the store and placed
him under arrest. He was at once taken
to police headquarters and placed in the
tanks pending further Investigation,
The auctioneer, . when questioned,
readily admitted that Ballard had been
in the habit of visiting his place of busi
ness and offering for sale various ar
ticles of jewelry and silverware. Several
days ago he purchased from him some
diamonds, which were identified by the
defectives as being a portion of the prop
erty taken from a private residence in
the Western Addition. In adtlition to t..e
stolen gems the detectives found in the
store a quantity of silverware, various
articles of jewelry and several otgunSj
all of which had been stolen by Kallard
and sold by him for about one-tenth their
value. The stolen property was removed
to police Headquarters, and to-day efforts
will be made to have the articles
identified.
Ballard is not unknown to the police.
Some time ago he and a companion vis
ited a saloon on Third street, and after
representing that they were commercial
travelers, induced the aged proprietor to
have a drink with them. While his atten- j
tion was temporarily distracted Ballard, j
it is claimed, slipped a "knockout drop |
into his glass. The unsuspecting victim, |
after wishing the two strangers good
luck " drank the drugged whisky. Shortly j
afterward he became unconscious, and
was carried into a rear room by the dcs- j
perate pair. They then opened the till
and got away with the contents, amount
ing to $32 50. Both men were arrested for
the crime but were afterward acquitted,
as the prosecution failed to establish a
case. A few weeks later Ballard robbed a i
printer of a gold watch after drugging \
him He was arrested after considerable
trouble and charged with robbery. Sub- j
sequently he was allowed to plead guilty ,
to petty larceny, and was sent to the |
County Jail for a' term of six months. The I
police are now working to locate his part- I
ncr As he is well known, they expect to
have little difficulty in landing him be
hind prison bars.
PAUL DE BAUGE TELLS
A TALE OF BLOOD
He Was Made the Victim of the Panei
Game â Woman Attacked Him
With His Own Dagger.
John Tracy, residence 14 Turk street,
took the stand yesterday morning in
the office of Coroner Hill and swore
that for the past year he had been
supported by Delia Tracy, alias O'Connor,
alias Reynolds, who was murdered last
Tuesday morning by Paul de Bauge.
Tracy said that he was a barkeeper by
occupation, and that he had n<>t worked
for a whole year, during which time he
had been living with the deceased.
The prisoner was present during the in
quest, with his counsel, John B. Carson
and James Long. His face is scratched j
from his encounter with the dead wosnau
and his right eye is blackened, the result
of his tussle with the arresting officers.
By advice of his attorneys, he declined
to make any statement.
Nothing new was developed by the in
quest except the statement made by the
prisoner in the office of Chief of Police
Lees on the day after the arrest. The
(statement was read to the jury by Otto
Heynemann, secretary to the Chief. It
appeared from the document that the wo- :
man robbed Bauge of $10 and shoved the i
money under the door, so that her accom
plice in the hallway outside could get it. |
When he demanded his money the j
woman ordered him out and threatened
to call the police if he did not go. Upon j
his refusal to go the woman scratched his
face and bit the little finger of his right
hand. In order to make her let ko of
his finger he choked her with a cord.
She then seized him and caused him I
such excruciating pain that he was driven
wild, and when she snatched his dirk out
of his hip pocket and attempted to stab
him he pulled it away from her. leaving
the handle in her hanfl. and stabbed her
to make her let go. Then, as she was
faintly crying "murder," he placed a pil
low over her mouth until she died.
The jury returned a verdict charping
De Bauge with murder. The prisoner was
arraigned before Judge Mogan in the
afternoon and the preliminary examina
tion was set for the 14th of this month.
