Six weeks ago Charles Baettge
â  T T
of the New California House -on
l^Tit cn tr a ir ed Frank Mar
tif and Joe Costa to go to the '
N^.nh Farallunes to gather sea
fowl eggs for the local market.
The men went to the rocks
under contract to supply Irvine
Bros., the grocers, with 5000
dozen of the eggs, but although
repeated attempts have been
made to take off what they had
gathered and supply the men
with water and provisions, only
twice was the attempt successful.
On the first occasion 120 dozen
01 eÂ£T2"s were taken ft, and again,
twelve days ago. the house
keepers on the South Farallones
got some water and provisions to
the imprisoned egg hunters.
For five days Martin and Costa
had not a drop of water to drink.
For three days and three nights
they were drenched to the skin by
the spray that broke continuously
over the rock,- and during this
trying experience the wild fowl
eggs served as both meat and
drink for them.
Monday last it became general
jv known that the men were in
danger of dying from thirst un
less assistance was sent to them
at once. The morning and even
ing papers wasted a great deal of
sv'mpathy â¢on the unfortunate
feilows imprisoned upon the
rocks, and also considerable space
in informing their readers that
water is what the marooned men
need." While all this stuff was
being put in type Martin and
Costa were, .thanks to The Call,
enjoying long draughts of the
much needed water. Incidentally
they were also enjoying a much
needed change of diet in the
shape of hard tack and canned
beef, also supplied by The Call.
Directly The Call management
heard of the plight in which the
unfortunate egg hunters had '
been placed., a tug was commis
sioned and a relief expedition I
organized. The instructions were j
to get the men off the rock if
possible. If that were impossible 1
to see that water and provisions
were supplied them in sufficient
quantities to sustain life until the
men could be taken off the rock ;
in safety. There were no in- j
structions in regard to the size or '
kind of a story that was to be
made out of the incident, but
simply the broad injunction,
"Save the men." :
The instructions were followed
to the letter. The weather was
such as to make a landing on the
rock impossible. The men would
not leave behind them the 1000 j
dozen of eggs gathered with
much care and tribulation, more |
particularly as a sloop was lying
at the South Farallones awaiting
a smooth sea to take them off. j
This sloop, the Ma Belle, lost I

THE CALL CARRIES AID TO MAROONED EGG HUNTERS.
When it was made public that two egg hunters. Frank Martin and Joe Costa, were marooned
on the bleak and inhospitable rocks of North Farallon Island, and had been for weeks without
water or food other than the eggs they had purposed to steal. The, Call lost no time in idle specu
lation as to the chances of the men being rescued, but immediately sent out the tug Reliance fully
provisioned in aid of the castaways. Notwithstanding the fact that the waves were running so high
that it was almost worth a man's life to attempt to approach the island in a boat, the sturdy and
brave men in charge of the tug succeeded in getting provisions and water to the suffering men. and
left them with the assurance that they would be looked after and taken off as soon as the waves went
down sufficiently to permit a landing.
Three times had the employers of the men attempted to succor them, and each time tnÂ°ir
efforts were made unavailing by the force of the storm. Three battered and stranded boats decaying
on the drear rocks tell the story of those attempts, but The Call's boat successfully fulfilled its mis
sion, and while the other papers of the city were telling the public that unless something ware done
quickly the men would die, The Call was landing provisions and water to the almost famished unfor
tunates.

lowed them to the rorks in order to
gather in the eggs for home consump
tion. "Farallon eggs." as they are
called, soon came into great demand,
owing to their cheapness, among bak- j
era and cheap restaurants, and in con- i
sequence the nests were systematically I
robbed to supply the market.
The raiding became so great that
fears were entertained that the mews
might become extinct, so the Govern- j
ment forbade everybody from taking j
eggs from the islands with the excep
tion of one individual, who was allowed
to take so many and no more. Even
this restriction did not give the desired
relief, so a few years ago the taking :
of eggs from the rocks was entirely !
prohibited.
When seal hunting was prohibited by j
the Government seal poaching began
and when the taking of eggs from the
Farallon rocks was stopped egg poach
ing began. Six weeks ago the season j
I for "Farallon eggs" opened and Frank ]
Martin and Joe Costa were quietly !
landed from the sloop Ma Belle, Com
! modore Baettge master, on the North
i Farallon rock.

fowl and thousands of sea lions make
their home (here, and as this is the
breeding season the lions are very fero- ]
cious. Several of them attacked the j
; egg hunters and on one occasion Joe j
! rvista would have lost his life had not j
j .Martin driven the sea lion off with an
i iron rod, which he poked into the in
furiated hrute's eye. It seized Costa
hy the leg, threw him down. and then !
1 mounted guard over him. Martin '
I grabbed an iron rod used in climbing
! the ciiff arid went to his companion's
assistance. A vigorous poke in the eye
caused the 11 to lose its balance and
go tumbling Into the breakers below.
This desolate island was the spot
i upon which Martin and Costa were to
j live until they had gathered in 5000
j dozen of eggs. Had all gone well no
i one would have known where the mar
ket supply came from, but then all did
not go well. The men were put on the
j rock in a dead calm and with provi
j sions sufficient to last them a week.
I For several days the calm continued
i and when the Ma Belle returned to the
city she carried 120 dozen of eggs with
her. On taking his leave Captain Bob
S Spear promised to return with water
I and provisions inside of four days. The
Ma Belle was back on the appointed
date, but in the meantime a storm had
come up and it was impossible to.com
municate with the imprisoned men. An
1 attempt was made, but directly, a skifX^

When the wind went down he re

a heavy sea was. running that noth

nates signaled .frantically that they
wanted water, but no water could be
given thorn because no boat could live
anywhere near the breakers. Another
storm came up and the sloop was near-
Jy swamped and had to run for San
Francisco.
Again the Ma Belle was provisioned
and this time she went out as a rescue
boat. Bad luck st' ' followed her and
when the Farallones were reached an
other storm was raging. The men had
now been without water or provisions
for a week and were reduced to living
on raw eggs. Their only covering from
the blinding spray was an old sail be
longing to the sloop and their resting
place was a cleft in the rorks. The Ma
Belle had again to run before the gale
after losing another skiff In a vain at

As the sloop disappeared in the dis
tance the two unfortunates almost gave
way to despair. The fact that their
plight was known gave them courage,

Despite the Fury of Wind
and Wave Relief Was
Sent (o the Suffering
Unfortunates.
While the Ma Belle was In San Fran
cisco being repaired and made ready
for a third attempt at rescue, the light
keepers on the South Farallon got an
inkling that all was not right on the
most northerly rock. From a remark
dropped by Spear they came to the con
clusion that some men were weather
bound on the rock, so on the first fine
day they launched a boat, provisioned
it with water, bacon, potatoes, onions,
two rabbits, several loaves of bread and
whatever else they could spare. When
they reached the rock Martin and Costa
were almost dead from thirst and ex
posure.
The lighthouse men are experts at
rigging up a trolley from the shore to a
boat, and it was not long before the
things they had brought with them
were passing over a heaving line to the
shore. Some charcoal brought from the
lighthouse was also sent ashore, and
with it Costa did not take long to make
a fire. The weather was such that the
men would have risked their lives to
leave the rock, but on receiving this
welcome installment of aid, they waved
farewell to the lightkeepers and turned
to the first cooked meal they had seen
in weeks.
This was a fortnight ago and the sup
ply of provisions given them by the
lightkeepers lasted only a little over a
week. Again they were reduced to an
; egg diet, and until The Call's relief ex
pedition arrived eggs had been meat
i and drink to them. It was easy to ap-
I pease their hunger.' but they were al
ways thirsty and toward the end the
desire for a drink of water was almost
maddening.
When the tug Reliance approached
! the rock they pointed to their parched
! throats and motioned that water was
j all they wanted. It was finally got
ashore to them in a five-gallon milk
; can and those poor fellows drank until
they could not hold the can to their
lips any longer. They were offered a
passage back to the city, but refused,
saying they had suffered the tortures
of the damned in order to secure the
eggs they went out for and now they
were going to take them to the city or
stay on the rock forever.
Enough canned meats, hardtack and
bread to last them a week were put
ashore. This will be more than enough
to last them, as the sea was rapidly
going down yesterday and by to-day or
to-morrow the Ma Belle will be able
to take them and their eggs off the
rock.
It was 6 o'clock Tuesday morning
when the tug Reliance with two Call
men aboard started for the North Far
j allon rock. Captain Gilbert Brokaw
i had made all the necessary arrange
ments and was ready for any emerg
ency. The skiff Vigilant was lashed on
deck and in it Captain Brokaw' said his
mate. J. Olsson, could make a landing
anywhere.
No one on the Reliance knew on
which of the three 'rocks forming the
North Farallones the' men were, so a
systematic search had to be made.
They were discovered on the most
northerly one of the group. A rope fas
tened to the pinnacle of the rock and
falling to a landing place near the base
revealed their whereabouts to Captain
Brokaw. On this spot were collected
! thousands of eggs, some in sacks and
! some in tin cans, but the majority lay
loose on the rock. The rope had been
used in scaling the rock to secure the
eggs.
Martin and Costa had been sheltered
from the wind in a fissure of the rock,
but a hail from the tug soon brought
them forth, when they made a panto
mime appeal for water. The skiff Vigi
lant was lanched from the deck of the
Reliance and a five-gallon can of water
j put in it. Mate Olsson and one of The
Call men got aboard and started for
the rock. It was impossible to make
a landing owing to the swell, so Mar
tin threw a rope to the boat and Olsson
| made it fast to the milk can. To make
I sure there would be no mishap, he fas
tened a second line to the can and held
it in his hand, paying out as Martin
hauled in. It was lucky he did so. as
the line Martin was hauling on parted
and both can and water would have
been lost.
The precious can was hauled back
aboard the skiff and again Martin
threw his line aboard and again it was
made fast to the can. This time Costa
got down on the rock and kept it from
chafing, so the water reached the rock
in safety. It did not take long to g<\
the lid off and then each man took a
long draught. As long as their weak
ened arms could hold the can up they
kept it to their lins, only to sit down

Both men were emaciated, but not as !
much as one would expect from what j
they had pone through. They were I
dressed in brown overalls and each had j
a sack around his shoulders. Costa j
lost his hat in the fight with the sea j
lion and was wearing one that he had
manufactured out of a piece or canvas j
Martin wore a black hat which showed j
traces of frequent contact with the
rocks. Both wore climbing- slippers
made of canvas and rope, and while
Martin showed a bountiful six weeks*
crop ef whiskers, Costa looked as
though he had been shaved a couple of
days ago.
By very careful handling Mate Ols-
Fon kept the skiff near enough to the
rocks to carry on a conversation. It
was not carried on in a stage whisper
and was occasionally drowned by the
"squawk! squawk!" of the myriad of
birds that circled overhead and the
"bark! bark!" of the sea lions.
"That is the first drink of water we
have had in five days," said Martin in
answer to a question. "We have used
eggs as meat and drink so long that j
the sight of one almost nauseates me
and I will never be able to look at a
murre again without disgust. We have
had several fights with the sea lions, j
and on Saturday, Sunday and Monday
we were drenched again and again with
the driving spray. We live in a hole
in the rock, but it is desperately cold
and we have not had a bit of fire since
the men from the lighthouse station
brought us some coke along with a sup
ply of provisions.
"No, we won't go back wijth you,

bring us in, because it is just like the

you see the Ma Belle will be here as
soon as the swejl goes down and that
will be to-morrow, I think, and we are
bound to get these eggs to market. We
have been out here a mighty long time
and Buffered considerable getting these
things gathered, and if we go away
now all our time and labor will be
wasted. We wouldn'.t have a cent to
show for all we have gone through. A
wash and a clean bed to Bleep in would
be worth more than the money, but
now we have stayed this long with the
venture we'll stay to the end.
"ThÂ« first time he was out here in
the Ma Belle, Spear stayed six days,
trying to make a landing, and the next
time he stayed a week. I never saw
such a run of bad weather and we got
the full benefit of it."
Just about this time the skiff Vigi
lant began to leak considerably and the
bailer had to be used freely. Mate Ols
son therefore roved back to the Re
liance and got the provisions Captain
Brokaw had fixed up. These were
taken back to the rock and safely got
ashore, after which no time was wasted
in getting the Vigilant back aboard the
tug. It was a wet. disagreeable Job,

ENGINEER AND
STATION AGENT
WERE AT FAULT
The Blame for the Newman Rail=
road Disaster Is Fixed
Upon Two Men,
R. B. ALLEN.
The engineer of the wrecked teachers' special, "upon whom blame is placed
for thi disaster.
OAKLAND, July U.â Engineer Allen and Conductor Fassett of the
Hl-fated train v.-recked at Newman yesterday returned to their homes
in this city to-night. They both feigned the strictest reticence when ap
proached by a reporter.
"I would not care to make any statement for a day or two." said
Allen. "I haven't been subpenaed to attend the inquest as yet, and
then will be time enough to talk. I would not lay the blame for the
wreck on any one, but I do feel there is no blame resting on myself or
our crew: I do not wish to state whether the lights at Newman indi
cated a clear track or not. I am sorry, but I will no.t give my version
of the affair until the proper time."
Conductor Fassett. when seen at his home, .863 Willow street, to
night, declined at first to speak, but finally volunteered a statement in
dicating that he regards the freight train crew responsible.
"I saw the lights at Newman just after the wreck and they were
for a clear track ahead, but of course lights may be wrong, just as peo
ple are sometimes wrong, and we are expected to use some judgment in
such matters. I would not place the blame. However, the freight train
was behind time, and it was my intention to hold my train at Newman
at least six minutes, because it is a rule that trains are not allowed to
follow each other within less than ten minutes, except in case special
permission is granted. I realized that we were nearing Newman sta
tion and I felt my train slacking down in speed. A minute later
there was a crash. Â®It was awful.
"I have not been subpenaed to the inquest yet. That is generally
done through the company. They attend to those matters. I can't feel
that our crew was to blame for the terrible wreck."
NEWMAN, July 11.â The bodies of Mrs. Lena Thomas and Miss Addie Harris,
who were killed in the train wreck here yesterday, were sent north on the
early morning train to-day. After the coffins were, placed in wooden boxes
a number of the ladies of this place called at Schank's undertaking parlors
and attached to' the rough boxes many beautiful floral offerings.
The wreckers have about finished clearing the wreckage from the .tracks and
placing it to one side to be hauled to the scrap-iron yards in this city.
The officials of the Southern Pacific Railroad have made a partial investiga
tion of the accident of Monday at Nswman, by which two women were killed and
many injured, and have fixed the blame upon Engineer Archie Ben Allen of the
teachers' excursion train and E. C. Hartwell, the station agent. With the latter it
was an error in the use of the semaphore signals, and with the former it was a
criminal blunder in running ahead of his time when he must have known that ha
was close to another train.
This is the judgment of J. A. Fillmore, manager of the Southern Pacific Rail
road Company's system. All day Monday the officials of the road were calling for
reports from their subordinates who were interested in or knew of the circum
stances attending the wreck. Mr. Fillmore, in discussing the sad- accident, .iesis
nated the freight as regular, No. 245. lie said the orders issued were that No. 'jls
should keep the main line and be passed when overtaken, and, according to cal
culations, this would occur at Ingomar. ten miles from where the wreck took
place The orders to the special excursion were that the train should keep out of
the way of all regular trains. By the signal system of the line this could havo
been done for at almost any one of the stations additional orders could be given
and received if there were any. According to the manager the regular. No. 245,
arrlvi '1 a.t Newman two minutes ahead of time, and the engineer, seeing by the
sigi al on the semaphore that there were no orders, the locomotive was stopped at
:ii. vater tank to take on a supply for the boilers.
When there are no orders the arm of the semaphore is down at an acute anjrla
and the white light is exposed. This was in condition when the regular, No. 245,
was standing at the tank, and the statijn agent could not put up the red light and
the extended arm while this train was there. When the special came In eight Sta
tion Agent E. C. Hartwell turned the semaphore to the red light, and upon En
gineer Allen whistling for signals Hartwell dropped the arm, showing the whita
light This was the- fatal mistake, and his excuse that he thought the excursion
would take the siding and pass the freight train seems to have but little weiyht at
headquarters. ' , .
The report of Engineer Allen of the special is that he was watching the
signals on the semaphore, for which he whistled, and did not drop his eyes to
the track ahead of him. Consequently he failed to see the lights on the rear
end of the regular freight until too late.
"Is there any question about the lights being on thÂ© rear of the freight
train?" was asked. . , .
"None whatever. The usual lights, were there all right, and, more than
that, tho brakeman, seeing the approaching train and fSaring that it was
likely to get too close, â¢grabbed the first lantern that he could getâ a white
lightâ and rushed down the track about 400 feet, waving it to attract the atten
tion of the engineer of the oncoming train," answered Mr. Fillmore, who went
on to say that the fault of Engineer Allen was that he had no business to have
been so near another train. The rules of the road require that a special
should be at least ten minutes behind regular trains.
"The blame for this sad accident," continued Mr. Fillmore, "lies with the en
gineer of the special and with the station operator. Allen was at fault for be
ing six minutes ahead of his time without having his engine under control.
That he reversed the lever and put on the air brakes to avert a collision when
he saw the lantern and the lights on the freight train is a fact, but that did not
lessen the damage. The station operator was at fault for giving a 'clear' sig
nal when the regular freight was standing on the main track at the station."
Mr. Fillmore said lhat the freight train was composed of about forty cars,
and, with the exception of the man on the extreme endâ he who ran down the
track with thf pignal lanternâ none of the crew knew of the seriousness of the
collisidn for several minutes. The engineer was first attracted to the occur
rence by a slight jar to the engine, for the train was so long that the shock
was lost before it reached the front end. To the engineer of the regular no
blame is attached by the railroad officials.
Engineer Allen has been suspended, but whethpr temporarily or permanent
ly is not knov â â¢. Tie has been running trains over that route for many years.
His first start in railroading was in 1888 as a fireman, and until the accident
of last Monday he has been rated as a careful and trustworthy employe.

COVELO, July 11.â Excitement due

' Marks frequently halloed and waited j
I for an answer, hearing only the echo j
'of his own voice. As he approached
a rocky divide in the canyon he was
startled by a roar from a huge pan- j
ther, which he quickly dispatched with j
his rifle. He became fearful that this
beast had perhaps devoured the girl,

land kittens close by it, he. was more
hopeful for her safety.
Men of every calling are mustered
into the search, and although un

none of them have proved authentic.
CONVICT CLAIMS THAT
JOHN W. GATES LIVES
Offers Aid to a Man Arrested for a
Murder of Twenty-eight
Years Ago.
MEXICO. Mo., July 11.â James Lee, an
inmate of the Missouri Penitentiary, Jef
ferson City. Mo., writes to a newspaper
here that Gilbert Gates, brother of John
W. Gates of Chicago, and for whose mur
der twenty-eight years afco Alexander
Jester is under arrest, was alive in 1894.
The letter In full follows:
I have noticed the publications In re
gard to the Jester case and will kindly
ask you if a deposition from me .vill
be given consideration, as I am well
acquainted with Gates and know that
he was alive and well in August. 1594,
and living in Arizona under the name
of George Dorsey. If you will write
to Monahan & Murphy, who run a
general store in Needles, Cal., they
will remember him. for we were min
ing and prospecting partners and often
bought supplies from them. If I can
be of service in the case I will give
you all the information I can. _ Jours
truly JAMES LEE.
Box 47. Convict No. 14.388.
Jester refused to-day to talk about the
convict's letter. He is growing stronger
every day and seems confident that he
will be cleared of the charge. He still
denies that he is the man wanted.
PROMISES MADE BY
DEWEY TO AGUINALDO
Admiral Said to Have Admitted That
He Was Aided by the Fili

BOISE, Idaho, July 11.â A. Mueller,
a wealthy brewer, has Just returned
from Manila. He was at the Philippines
before Dewey's victory. He makes a
sensational statement, quoting Dewey,
to the effect that Aguinaldo and his
men aided Dewey in running the fleet
into harbor, in pursuance of a prear
ranged plan, the promises made Aguin
aldo coming from Washington. The
promises never were kept, and that is
one of the reasons for Aguinaldo's bit
terness. Mueller is president of one of

ELECTIOTT AT BOISE.
Republicans Score an Overwhelming
Victory.
BOISE, Idaho, July 11.â The city elec
tion here resulted in a complete vic
tory for the Republicans. Judge J. H.
Richards, a former Coloradoan, was
elected Mayor, and six of the nine
Councilmen are Republicans. The Re
publicans also elected the Attorney,
Tax Collector and Treasurer, losing the
Clerk and the Assessor. Women Clerk
and Tax Collector were elected. Ex
cept on the head of the ticket the Re
-1 publican majority averages 250 out of
a total of 1563 votes cast. The vote was
nearly 1200 short as compared to that
of the last general election, there be
ing almost that many stay-at-homes.
In 1896 this city gave Bryan a ma
jority of 916 votes. The head of the
Republican ticket was slashed because
in 1896 Richards left the Republican
party, coming back last year. He re

PATRICK KERVIN DIES
UNDER SURGEON'S KNIFE
Mining Expert Succumbs, to the
Effects of an Operation for
Chronic Pneumonia.
SAN JOSE, July 11.â Patrick Kervin,
one of the best-known mining men in
the West, died at the O'Connor Sani
tarium in this city at 7 o'clock this
evening of pneumonia. He came to the
sanitarium on June 13. Previous to
this he had been in the Waldeck Hos
pital at San Francisco for a month.
Kerwin was a native of County Wex
ford, Ireland. 61 years of age. He came
to California in ISR3 and engaged in
mining, which he had followed success
fully since. Kervin was superintendent
of the Consolidated Virginia, Best &
Belcher, Gould & Curry and Utah
mines. He was also interested in these
and other properties. For a number of
years he was superintendent of the On
tario at Park City, Utah. He returned
to California eleven years ago and be
came identified with the Comstock
mines. A widow and three children
survive him.
As Kervin gradually grew worse the
pneumonia became chronic and the
only hope of saving his life lay in an
operation, which was performed this
afternoon. He never rallied.
Kervin was a practical miner, and
his judgment was greatly sought by
corporations. He aided in developing
many mines and did much to advance
properties undm his superintends'!!' y.
He is reported to have had a consider
able fortune. Arrangements for the
funeral have not yet been made.

Thomas J. Kirk, State Superintendent
of Public Instruction of California, after
bidding the educators welcome to Cali
fornia, said in part:
On this western shore, separated by the

the last ten years; secondary and higher edu
cation have had unprecedented growth. "With
the beneficence of Senator Stanford the great

students. Its endowment Ib over twenty
millions. "Within the same period the colleges
at Berkeley have Increased their enrollment |
from &<> to 1700. Including the professional
colleges located in tian Francisco our State
University now ha.s an enrollment of 5438. Hut
numbers do not tell the whole story. There
has been an enlarged curriculum to meet the
growing demands of modern life. And yet we
have tallen short of our Ideals. We realize
that we are still giving the masses of children
inadequate preparation for the beat citizen

of these problems. You bring the experience of
older States joined to your own wisdom and

Dr. Elmer E. Brown, a professor of the
University of California and State Direc
tor, on behalf of the State management,
followed with the assurance that never
Viefore has Los Angeles 60 deserved its
name, as the city is now full of angels of
education. He assured the visitors that
their attentiveness to all chat is said to
them induced the telling of big stories, a
temptation that is hard io resist. The
speaker said that here will be found the
best system of county schools that can be
found anywhere outside of ' Massachusetts,
a reference that provoked a storm of
handclappinga from the New England
delegates. He reminded tne people that,
though they had come across the desert,
they find that California is not wholly
isolated. His praise of the teachers as
members of a great profession was fol
lowed by his expression of welcome to the
delegates.

were made by N. C. Dougherty, Superin

ferred to the first meeting of the associa
tion in Philadelphia, when thirty-eight
members were enrolled, and compared it
with the enrollment of more than 10,000 In
Washington last year. He also spoke of
the progress made in other respects
by the association. The National Educa
tional Association is aj.i organization
through which the educators of the coun
ry can reach large bodies of teachers. Ho
referred to several minor school problems
which should be considered in the near
future by the association, . mong which he
emphasized "continuation schools."
Dr. Lyt ecpncluded his address by ex
pressing the hope that "the present meet-

EDUCATIONAL POLICY
OF NEW POSSESSIONS
Ideas Suggested by United
States Commissioner of
Education Harris.
LOS ANGELES. July 11.â The evening
session was as largely attended as had I
been the one in the afternoon. In addi- j
tion to the Woman's Orchestra, the Aoe
dean Club, under the direction of Mrs.
G. B. Parsons, supervisor of music in the
public schools, enlivened the proceedings
by the very happy rendering of several
â¢ lons.
Dr. W. T. Harris, United States Com
missioner of Education, delivered a most
appropriate and decidedly interesting ad
dress on the subject of "An Educational
Policy for Our New Possessions." One
remarkable statement that apparently i
passed unheeded was that we took 11 for
granted that both Cuba and Porto Rico
would be under United States armed con
trol for several years. The States of
! modern Europe all seek to obtain a reve
! nue from their new possessions. This is
| all right so far as the ends of just gov- |
ernment are subserved. Up to a certain i
point there is an altruistic effort on the !
I part of these modern nations to uplift !
these new peoples. From the United ;
States one looks for a new step more al
truistic. It is a strong dash of this Idea
that has created the party of anti-expan
sion. They believe that none should be
admitted to the rights of citizenship who
are unable to govern themselves. The
admission of peoples unable to be ad
mitted to citizenship seems to be a de
parture and to threaten some of our
cherished Institutions. Expansion in
some form is seen, however, to be un
avoidable. In view of the fact that other
nations are dividing up the world, some
people think it our duty to show what
we can do. In concluding, he said:
The United States can uplift whole nations.
Is not this better than to build a Chinese wall
about our liberties? It Is absurd to say that
we will tyrannize over those incapable of self
government. We must accept the charge of such
colonies as come to us and give them the bene
fits-of civilization. But it lÂ£ asked what right
have we to give other people our civilization
by force. In other words, is ours a high civil
ization and what is the highest form? A people
is civilized when it has formed institutions
which enable each Individual to benefit and
prosper by the thoughts and deeds of all his
fellows and In turn benefit them. Civilization
enables man to conquer nature and make it his
servant. There is no tribal civilization on the
face of the earth an.l never was that compares
with modern nations. A nation may be very
far advanced in its control of the forces of
nature and get the benefit of past experience
and yet give those benefits only to the few. The ,
highest Ideal of a civilization is that which
is constantly lifting lower peoples to a higher ;
plane and Increasing the individual effective
ness and that cannot be paid to exist in a
tribal form or even in some far advanced na- !
tionalities. If we cannot come into contact ,
with lower nations without exterminating them I
we are still far from the goal. We must take
th. from the civilization of tradition and
force upon them the civilization of the printed |
page and make them capable of local self-gov- ;
ernment and able to master nature and Its ;
forces. In Its ability to do this our civilization
proves itself superior and the question Is
answered, In our new possessions all must
be educated, not only in letters, but industrial
arts. For Cuba and Porto Rico good school
supervisors should be appointed. Instruction
in English should be carefully and slowly In- j
culcated, but without the evident desire to â ,
force the constant use of English, the knowl
edge of such a desire always preventing Its
acceptance by new peoples. In this way new
benefits will be given them, they will become
masters of the forces of nature and become
fully conscious of the meaning of the brother
hood ol man.
Mrs. Emma L. Dilllngham was to have
dealt with the Hawaiian school question
to some extent by giving an address re- i
viewing the history of the existing schools j
in the islands. Owing to her unavoidable I
absence this phase of the subject had to
be foregone, but Henry S. Townsend, in
spector general of schools of Hawaii,
made a thoughtfully conceived address
upon the subject of "The Educational
Problem in Hawaii." He said that minds
in general develop In accordance with cer
tain fixed and ascertainable laws, yet the
first principle's of the science imply that
no two men think, or feel, or will, or de
velop alike, since no two have the same
temper and environment. 1 In like man
ner, he continued, it follows that different
races and peoples develop differently and
hence have their own educational prob
lems, which are but modifications of tho
world's great educational problem. Con
cluding Dr. Townsend said:
The environment nnd the temper of th*
children of Hawaii are especially diversified,
although this environment of things Is com-
Varatively homogeneous. This Is due largely
to the diversity of races, with all that that im
plies. The ends of the earth meet at Hawaii,
and no one race is predominant In numbers.
Present indications are that the generation
next to be born in Hawaii will consist of white
persons and Hawaiians In almost equal num
bers, and of still large numbers of Asiatics.
These latter will not be assimilated with the
other elements of our future population so as
to form one people, though It is possible that
the whites and the Hawaiians will thus unite.
In spite of radical racial differences. One prob
lem involves at least two races of men In
nearly equal numbers living side by side within
our narrow boundaries without uniting. Poly
nesians and Asiatics cannot be made to think
and feel as Anglo-Saxons by the simple process
of teaching them the English language, or by
any other process which does not Involve evolu
tion through nations. Yet, in the meantime,
we must live together. "What, then. Is this
great race Droblem In Hawaii? It is this: To
develop a truly Christian civilization, a civ
ilization which like the love of Christ Is broad
enough to embrace all peoplesâ so broad that all
the races may find prosperty under its benign
sway. Our Hawaiian civilization should be
based upon broad charity and universal good
will.
The civilization which the active race haÂ«
developed and in which it has been trained,
based upon an assumption of universal selfish
ness, has precipitated a struggle in which the
passive race is at a great disadvantage. It is
a melancholy fact that the influence of the
white man and his civilization In contact with
the aboriginal races is generally the Influence
of the fable of the upas tree. From the lime
of the ancient Hebrews, who shut from the
blessings of their civilization practically all
other peoples, down to the time of the Amer
icans, who have not yet developed a civiliza
tion sufficiently broad and sufficiently Chris
tian to bless the white man and the red, cornea
the same monotonous story. Here the native
Hawaiian* were born and here they will die.
They call for more than toleration. Who are
we that we should tolerate this remnant of the
people to Whom God gave those fair isles fresh
from his creative hand and who for nearly
fifty generations have known no other home?

selves, and for these reasons their silent appeal
to their neighbors of the active race is es
pecially strong.
Now that the convention has settled
down to business the question who shall
be the next president and where the next
convention shall be held Is uppermost In
the minds of the delegates. One provision
of the N. E. A. constitution provides that
the retiring president becomes the lirst
vice president, hence all idea of succession
is precluded. The office of president usu
ally seeks the man. ;.s Secretary Shepard
declares there Is n" politics and no special
buttonholing in the N. K. A. Still it is
conceded that the presidency will come to
the West and with that concession a <iuiot
little boom has been launched In behalf
of Professor A. J. Foshay, Superintendent
of the lx>s Angeles Public Schools. This
may be a compliment to the educator be
cause he resides in the present convention
city.
Amonp other Californians spoken of is
Professor Klmer K. Brown of Berkeley,
who is a great favorite among a large
number of northern delegates. His.
chances were to-day slightly improved by
being- elected vice president of the Na
tional Council of Education.
Another Californian who is very promi
nently mentioned by the Oakland and San
Francisco delegates is Professor H. H.
Webster. City Superintendent of the San
Francisco Public Schools. The quiet at â 
titude of his friends leads many to think
that he Is stronger than he appears upon
the surface.
The extreme Northern and Central
States have two candidates In l>. D. Har
vey. Superintendent of Public Instruction
in Wisconsin, and Charles M. Jordan, Su
gerintendent of the Minneapolis Public
chools. It is to-night said that Jordan
is so popular with the delegates of tho
Mississippi Valley that if he will permit
the use of his name he will be the next
president. This feature does not suit the
Wolverines, and they have begun a hunt
that may result in winning the prize for
their candidate.
The cities that are in the running: for
the honor of entertaining the National
Educational Association in 10iX) are Cin
cinnati. Charleston, S. C, Asbury Park,
N. J., Saratoga Springs, N. V., and Mon
treal. The contest practicaly has narrowed
down to Cincinnati, Charleston and Mon
treal.
The Carolinians have sent a strong dele
gation, headed by F. G. O'Nell, president
of the Hibernia National Bank, and W. M.
Wlleon, president of the Chamber of Com
merce. They have opened headquarters,
and are dispensing the courtesies of the
South with a characteristic hospitality.
The Porkopolites concede nothing, and
claim that as the association was created
in that city In 18f>8. and that as it has
never returned to its oradlp since its natal
day, no greater honor could be conferred
than to have it go home and receive the
paternal blessings.
To all this the Canadians enter a demur
rer and plead that no fairer and more
pleasant city can be found to entertain
guests in summer. This whole question
will be decided on Thursday morning,
when the nominating committee meets in
annual session.

PAID DEARLY FOR
THEIR LEGAL STRIFE
MILL. VALLEY, July 11.â In a de
cision handed down by the Supreme
Court of the State last Thursday is
written the end of a famous contro
versy between two wealthy residents of
this place, which has been fought cut
in the Superior Courts for a period of
nearly fifteen years. Thousands of dol
lars have been expended by both liti
gants and long ago the expense of mak
ing the legal battle footed up a great
deal more than the value of the prop
erty which was the bone of contention,
but both men were too stubborn to
yield.
The two litigants are Jacob Garde
ner and Ebenezer Wormouth. Years
ago the trouble between them origi
nated over the ownership of forty acres
of land, valued now at about $1000 an
acre. They went to law and for six or
seven years the case was pending in
the Superior Court of Marin County
and then passed on to the Government
Land Office. The Supreme Court has
finally decided in favor of Wormouth.
The victory proves a costly one, as
between the two men about $50,000 is
computed to have been spent in liti
gation. One man alone made $1000 sim
ply in publishing the legal notices re
quired by the case. Both men are cele
brated characters. It was about two
years ago that Wormouth was sand
bagged and robbed at night, and last
summer while he was absent in Sausa
lito his house was looted by a burglaj-.
Gardener recently had a disagreement
over the ownership of a piece of land
with another citizen, which was settled
by his opponent building a shanty on
the land and holding it with a shotgun.
FLEES TO AVOID
PAYING ALIMONY
SAN JOSE, July 11.â Henry M. N.
Spring, Councilman and clothier, has
disposed of his interest in the firm of
T. W. Spring & Son and gone to
Chicago, presumably to avoid paying
his former wife, Mrs. Emilie Spring,
$200 a month alimony. A few weeks
ago Mrs. Spring obtained a divorce
from her husband on the gTound of in
fidelity, two San Francisco young
ladies being named as corespondents.
She was awarded the custody of three
minor children and given $200 a month
alimony.
Spring went on the witness-stand and
said he was penniless. This was a sur
prise, because his interest in the cloth
ing house of Spring & Son was esti
mated to be worth about $40,000, and,
besides, he had other property.
TOday bill of sale was JJle<J, J>y
which Spring transferred one-half In
terest in the clothing house to Fred "W.
Moore, his brother-in-law, the con
sideration being given as $8000. At the
same time two deeds were filed trans
ferring his fine residence and the ad
joining lot at Seventh and San An
tonio streets to Marcella S. Moore, his
sister. It states the transfer is made
for "love and affection" and "also for
better maintenance, support, protection
and livelihood of the grantor."
Spring represents the Third Ward in
the City Council. It is said his resigna
tion is now in the hands of Mayor
Martin.

temper and "talking back" at Commls-
Bloner Scarborough and a delegation of
citizens at a meeting of the Board of Po
lice Commissioners two weeks ago. The

in the Police Commission, and the inci
dent which came so near costing the
Chief a suspension from pay and duty,
may be said to be closed so far as any
particular action on it by the Commis
sioners is concerned.
GRAND DUKE MICHAEL
TO BE THE SUCCESSOR
Czar Nicholas of Russia Names His
Brother as Heir to the
Throne.
ST. PETERSBURG, July 11.â The Of
ficial Messenger to-day publishes an im
perial manifesto worded as follows:
"Our beloved brother and heir to the
throne, the Grand Duke George Alex
androvitch, died at Abb;\s Tuman,
June 28 (old style). The illness which
attacked him might, it was hoped,
yield to the treatment initiated and the
intluence of the southern climate, but
God willed otherwise. In submitting
without a murmur to the decree of
Providence, we call our faithful sub
jects to share our deep sorrow with us
and to offer fervent prayers for the re
pose of the soul of our departed
brother.
"Henceforward, and so long as it may
not please God to bless us with a son,
the right of succession to the throne
devolves, according to the precise defi
nition of the law of succession, upon
our beloved brother, the Grand Duke
Michael Alexandrovitch.

Miners Will Get Their Pay.
SAX ANDREAS, July 11.â As was pre
dicted in Saturday's dispatches to The
Call, the late difficulties of the Fort
Wayne Gold Producing Company of In
diana arc about at an end. Ten days ago
the works and cash in bank at Stockton
wore attached by the striking workmen,
who ha<] two months' wages due them.
This was owing; to the company not pro
ducing on pay day, a-^ some difficulties
existed between the local management
and the Eastern stockholders. J. F.
Clapp, manager and promoter of the
property for many yearn, will be super-
ceded. The miners who attached the
property have agreed to pay costs if the
stockholders pay back wages for two
months. This was mutual, and a perfect
understanding seems to exist. Work will
be resumed at an early date.
WIDESPREAD PLOT
TO REMOVE MILAN
NEW YORK. July 11.â The Sun's cable
from Vienna says: The Politlsche corre
spondent says that an inquiry into the
recent attempt to assassinate ex-King
Milan of Servia shows that it was a part
of an astonishingly widespread conspiracy
and was intended as a prologue to the
overthrow of the dynasty and the entire
present regime.
Other reports indicate that the persons
arrested in connection with the attempt
include three ex-Minlsters. three ex-Sec
retaries of State, two Judges of the Court
of Appeals, nine members of the Skupsh
tina, or parliamentary body, nine pro
fessors and a sprinkling of military and
police officers, priests, students and civil
servants.

NO RELIEF YET FOR
THE FIRE DEPARTMENT
The Finance Committee of the Board
of Supervisors met last evening and failed
to do anything more than preserve tha
status quo of the pretty little game ol
politics just now being played by the Firs
Department. Representatives of nearly
every improvement club in "the city were
on hand to speak either for or against an
increase in the department's allowance in
the tax levy, and there was a good bit ol
mighty spell-binding done. The commit
tee, however, suddenly broke off Its de
liberations and adjourned to this after
noon at 2 o'clock without taking action.
Fire Commissioner Bohen was heard
first. He merely said he had come to get
an answer from the committee to the
j propositions that he had made. Chairman
: Perrault replied that the committee had
j thought that it could take a portion ol
the amount asked for by the department
i out of the police fund, but had discovered
later that it could not. "The only other
I thing we can do," continued Mr. Perrault,
"is to take $9000 out of the urgent neces
sity fund."
Chief Sullivan got up at this and said
that $!K)00 would carry the department
over the month of July very nicely. Asked
by Perrault if the amount was to be used
for salaries, he replied that it was not,
that the salaries were provided for and
that the $9000 would be used for fodder
and the general expenses of the depart
ment.
A parley among: the members of the
committee ensued at Perrault's d^sk and
he subsequently announced that some of
the members were not In favor of ex
tending even the temporary relief he had
suggested, and that the meeting would
have to go over for a day or so. Al
though Sullivan had expected a decision,
and so had the half dozen heads of im
provement clubs who had been got into
line, be made no objection to postpone
ment, and it was so ordered. The ques
tion will come up again this afternoon at
2 o'clo; k.
Chief of Police I,ecs was called upon to
show cause why his department allow
ance should not be slashed, and he did so
by informing the board that most of his
apportionment was provided for by stat
ute and could not be cut. He also pointed
out that under the new charter the park
police would be made a part of his de
partment and incidentally he took occa
sion t<> say that tlie general expense of
government would bp greatly increased
by the provisions of the charter.
Colin M. Boyd appeared to protest
against any reduction in the public
library fund, and Treasurer Truman and
Joe Goddard, chief deputy under County
Cl^rk D.-ane, came In for the same pur
pose. Dr. Barbat appeared for the Board
of Hf-alth and waved the yellow flag of
quarantine wildly In an attempt to con
vince the committee that his department
would need iKiT.ISu to pull through the
year with. He held up smallpox and the
possibility of an epidemic of It as a very
strong probability ami wound up by read
ing the rather extensive list of employes
to whom the hoard is now paying salaries.
After bearing rt pr< sentatives of differ
ent improvement clubs in protests against
curtailing the Fire Department, adjourn
ment was taken to this afternoon.

while In Dr. Burkes sanitarium at Santa
Rosa and passed away a few minutes aft
erward. The deceased was known
throughout the West and the news of his
death will be received with regret by all
who enjoyed his friendship. He came to
this State in IS6S and established a coffee
and chocolate business. His fame as a
business man was widespread and he en-
Joyed a lucrative income from his splen
did Investment.
He was a generous man and many poor
families owe their relief from starvation
to his kindness. During- the critical
period in Monterey County recently, when
the residents in that vicinity were suffer
ing on account of the drought, Mr. Guit
tard quietly and unostentatiously spent
his money and brought sunshine to the
homes of many needy ranchers.
The deceased was prominent In Masonic
circles and up to the time of his illness
took an active part in the order. Ho was
also a member of the French Benevolent
Society. Merchants' Association and kin
dred organizations.
Mr. Guittard was 61 years of age at the
time of his demise. He leaves a widow
and eight children to mourn his loss. The

CALIFORNIA WILL GET
ONE-HALF THE SPACE
The Paris Commission yesterday re
ceived a letter from G. B. Brockett, head
of the division of pomology in the United
States Department of Agriculture at
Washington. D. C, notifying the Com
missioners of the allotment of space that
had been made for the display of canned
and evaporated goods from California.
The space given to this State, though
circumscribed. Is one-half of the total
space allowed the United States. The
area of the compartment, however, Is
quite sufficient to allow the best of our
products in this line, and none but the
best will be accepted, to receive ample
notice. It is 15 feet in length, 6 feet in
depth and 10 feet in height.
There has been no space given for the
display of fresh fruit preserved in glass
in its natural state, but in the cases of
a few exceptionally fine specimens room
will be made somewhere.

STRANDED LINER PARIS
HAULED OFF THE ROCKS
Removed From Her Critical
Position and Will Be Towed
to Falmouth.
LONDON, July 11.â The salvagers have moved the American line
steamer Paris astern for a distance of 150 yards and have
shifted the vessel's position slightly to the eastward. They
hope to be able to get the after stoke hole fires alight.
The Paris is now clear of the rocks. The sea la smooth,
but a heavy fog prevails to-night. The intention of the salvagers was
simply to slue the stern of the liner so as to facilitate the operations
of the divers, but it was found that she moved more freely than was
expected. Three salvage boats alone practically removed her from a
critical position unaided. She still has a distinct list to starboard and
cannot be assumed out of danger. The tugs are preparing to tow her to
Falmouth harbor.
The German salvagers are elated at their unexpected success in
floating the Paris. She had been weighted with nearly a thousand tons
of granite at the stern, with a view of hoisting her bows free from
the rock. The divers had difficulty in getting at the rock, and this
was the reason for the tentative effort to move her. Several tugs from
Falmouth proceeded to the scene, but the Germans were not anxious
their assistance, offering the largest tug only $25 for towage, an offer
which was promptly refused. It was then decided that the vessel, be
ing in a position of comparative safety, should remain where she was
for the night and that the divers should continue their work of patch
ing the hull, so as to minimize the risk of towing. Unless something
unforeseen occurs, the Paris will be towed to Falmouth to-morrow, and
if on inspection her condition warrants it she will be taken to South
ampton or to some other dock for repairs.
The weather late this evening is rather unfavorable, the symptoms
being rain, fog, a falling barometer and a slight wind from the south
east. An increase in the wind might prove serious. Every precaution
has been taken to anchor the liner securely. The coast guards are
keeping a close lookout.
Captain Watkins, the other officers and twenty members of the
crew are still on board. The pumps are coping with the water and
there is no danger of the vessel sinking. It is understood that the sal
vagers are the same parties who floated the Peninsular and Oriental
steamer China, which went ashore in March last year on Azadea point.

SIX CONVICTS DROWNED
I CONDITION OF AFFAIRS IN TWO
INUNDATED COUNTIES.
i Cotton Speculators in East I'ake Ad
vantage of Loss of Crops, but Gov
ernor Sayers Will Not Enter
a Gambling Controversy.
Special Dispatrh to The Call.
AUSTIN, Tex., July 11.â Not less
than 20,000 hungry men. women and
! children in the flooded districts of
Texas were fed by the bountiful hand
'' of charity to-day. It is probable that
there were a few thousand sufferers in
the remote districts of the blighted re
gion who did not receive their quota
of food, but this was through no fault
of the many committees who have ac
tive charge of the relief and distribut
ing work.
The worst condition of affairs in the
; inundated region now exists in Brazo
-1 ria and Fort Btnd counties, and it will
I probably be several days before there
Is much improvement in that section.
Six State penitentiary convicts lost
their lives in Fort Bend County yes
terday by drowning. The penitentiary
! board of directors will meet here to
i morrow to take action in regard to tne
heavy LOSS Of crops and property on
! the convict plantations in Fort Bend
County, which are still under water.
Governor Sayers received a telegram
to-day from W. Gerard of Baltimore,
i Md., stating that the extent of the
: damage to crops, and the Buffering ol
the people is being belittled for cold
blooded mercenary reasons, and that
the New York cotton speculators are
heavily short on the market for that
reason. The telegram concludes by ask
-1 ing the Governor to discredit the re
! ports and let the world at large knew
the true condition of affairs. The Gov
ernor replied by wiring Mr. Gerard that
'< he would not allow himself to become
involved with the gamblers in cotton
on the one side or the other. The Gov
ernor does not hesitate to say, however,
; that the loss to the cotton crop is as
great as has been estimated in any of
the published reports. The loss will
considerably exceed 500,000 bales.
S. Taliaferro, chairman of the Harris
County relief committee, wired Gover
nor Sayers to-day as follows:
"Our advices show enough supplies of
! bacon, flour and corn meal at points
'. from Hempstead down to supply ac
tual necessities to points east of the
river for about three days. There is a
I congestion at some points and a mea
: ger supply at others. I have sent men
i out on the line of the railway to rem
! edy this. Our goods are very low. Col
â¢ leeting committees are still out. We
i are having negrroes held at distribut
ing places so they can go to work when
the water recedes, but they will have
; to be fed and assisted when they re
turn to work as well as while at dis
tributing points."
It is estimated that over 100 carloads
of food supplies and clothing were con
tributed by the people of the State for
the sufferers to-day. A number of
large cash contributions were received,
; among them being $10,000 from the C.
P. Simmons Medicine Company of St.
, Louis, through their Texas customers.
ASTORIA'S GREETING TO
OREGON VOLUNTEERS
Big Marine Procession to Meet the
Transports Newport and
Ohio.
ASTORIA, Or., July 11.â The several
patriotic societies of this city are mak
ing extensive preparations to welcome
the returning Oregon volunteers upon
their arrival here.
To-night Mayor Bergman wired to
General Summers, who is returning
with the troops, asking him to allow
the boys to land here for five or more
hours, the intention being to banquet
them. The Mayor also wired Governor
(Jeer asking for his co-operation. It is
the purpose of the people of this city to
get up a monster marine procession and
meet the Newport and Ohio at the
heads. The troops will be brought
ashore and banqueted and otherwise
entertained if General Summers' con
sent to the arrangements can be ob
tained. Without doubt the request will
be granted, as several hoursâ perhaps
a dayâ will be required to transfer the
troops from the transports to the river
steamers.
The coming of the transports will be
signaled to Astoria from Tillamook
Rock, and the marine procession will
immediately leave to meet them.

CLARK CHANGES
HIS TESTIMONY
Cannot Positively Iden
tify Corcoran.
TELLS ABOUT WARDNER RIOT
ONE SENSATION SPEUNG AT THE
MURDER TRIAL.
It Is the Attempt of One of the
Owners of the Standard Mine
to Compel the Witness to
Stick to His First Story.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WALLACE, Idaho, July 11.â In the
trial of Paul Corcoran for the killing of
James Cheyne the prosecution this
morning called John Clark as a -wit
ness. Clark testified that he had been
recording secretary of the Burke union,
but had n<ii attended the two meetings
prior to the day of the riot. On that
day he was at Mace, where the Stan- i
dard mine is located, and when the â 
train, bearing the men from Burke
came along he boarded it and went to j
Wardner. He went up into the town of
Wardner and did not witness the law
less acts perpetrated on that day, but
returned to Burke on the train which
bore the returning rioters.
Witness said that when the train was
nearing Wallace on the return trip he j
believt d he saw the defendant sitting
on t"' of a boxcar. At the time tho i
witness testified before the Coroners
jury he swore positively to the Identity
of the defendant, but since that time he !
had come to believe that he might be
mistaken, and could not now identify
Corcoran as being the man he saw on !
the car, although he had been ac- '
quainted with the defendant for more
than three years.
The entire morning session was oc- i
cupied with the examination of Clark. !
In the afternoon the same witness told '
of his whereabouts since the day of the ,
riot. He had been arrested and con- j
fined in a barn then used as a prison
until after he had testified before the j
inquest, after which he was released,
but was rearrested three weeks ago
and was now held in custody by order
of the representatives of the Govern- j
.ment.
Somewhat of a sensation was ere- j
ated by the witness stating that he had i
been taken into a private room imme- j
diately after being brought to Wallace j
from the bull pen yesterday and there
interrogated by Mace Campbell of the j
firm of Finch & Campbell, owners of
the Standard mine, who told him that
he had better stick to the story he told
before the Coroner's inquest and posi
tively identify the defendant. Clark
said that he had not been approached
by any one in the interest of the de
fendant, but now he doubted that he
had seen the defendant on the day of I
the riot because of the facts which had
come to his knowledge since that time.
Manager Burbidge of the Bunker Hill
Company testified to the troubles bey
tween that company and its employes,
as did Superintendent Burch, who was
under cross-examination when court
adjourned.
That the State authorities have not
ceased persecuting men Is shown by the !
fact that Commissioners Simmons and \
Boyle were confined all night in the i
jail, preparatory to being removed to i
the bull pen, from which they were
saved for the present by a subpena j
from the defense. Simmons had not j
been arrested prior to yesterday, and
there is no charge against him.
Governor Steunenberg to-day apv j
pointed J. E. Gyde of Wardner, Scott I
Anderson of "Wallace and Fynis Gor- '
don of Delta County Commissioners t<v
fill the places of the deposed members.
Gordon is a rancher, Anderson a merÂ»

Ice Plant for Marysville.
MARYSVILLE, July 11.â A New York !
capitalist is in this city with a view to :
selecting a location for an icemaking ma
chine and cold-storage plant, and from
his observations he has concluded that
Marysville presents a good opening for
such an undertaking. He represents a
company to be incorporated with the
name of the locality selected. The town
will be required to make a donation of
the site, situated so that a switch may be
run from the railroad. It is proposed to
build a ten-ton ice plant, the product to
be sold at not to exceed three-quarters of
a cent a pound. The cold-storage build
ing is to be 50x300 feet, the entire cost of
the plant to be $30,000. A meeting of the
improvement association has been called
for next Tuesday evening to discuss the
advisability of giving the bonus. ..

GALUNEER IS
NOW ON TRIAL
Alleged Violationof Civil
Service Law.
RESULT OF CAMPAIGN WORK
OFFICE HOLDERS SAID TO HAVE
BEEN ASKED FOR COIN.
Former Governor Busiel of New
Hampshire Makes the Charges
. Against the United
States Senator.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CONCORD, N. H., July 11.âRepresenta
tives of the United States Civil Service
Bureau began a sitting here to-day for
the purpose of investigating charges pre
ferred against Senator J. H. Gallinger of
Concord by former Republican Governor
Charles A. Busiel, alleging violations of
the civil service law during the last cam
paign in this State. The specific charge
is that Senator Gallinger, as chairman of
the Republican State Committee, distrib
uted circulars appealing to Republican
office-holders for contributions to the
campaign funds.
Civil Service Commissioners J. B. Har
low and Mark S. Brewer, who arrived
here from Washington, were in charge ot
the investigation. Senator W. E. Chand
ler was among those present as a party
Interested, though whether as a prose
cutor of defendant is somewhat uncertain,
in view of the charges and counter
charges made. The only witnesses at
hand when the session opened were Post
master Knox of Manchester, National
Hank Examiner Carroll of Warner and Â£.
F Clifford, who was Assistant Secretary;
of the State Committee during the cam- |
This investigation is held to allow the i
Commissioners to examine the evidence!
and to decide if it warrants the further
prosecution of the case. If they decide
that it does the United States authorities,
of the Department of Justice will be
called on.
At the conclusion of the morning ses
sion it was announced by the Commis
sioners that Mr. Busiol detailed the cir
cumstances which attended his making
complaint to the Civil Service Commission
last October and the correspondence be
tween him and the commission.
Senator Gallinger asked the commission
if he was to understand that the real
complainant was ex-Governor Busiel or
Senator Chandler, and was told he might
draw his own conclusions.
Governor Busiel read a long statement
as to his reasons for action in the mat
ter saying that he was animated by a
desire to see the civil service laws, in
which he believed, enforced. He consid
ered that the lavish use of money in elec
tions was a menace to our national insti- !
tutions He was not actuated by any un- j
friendly feeling toward Senator Gallinger ,
in prosecuting the charges and he had no
d< Bire for revenge.
Senator Chandler desired to make a i
statement, but the Commissioners in- ;
formed him that he would have an oppor- ,
tur.ity later. j
The principal feature of the session was -
a long sttement by Senator Chandler, pre-
Vtouel to which, however. Colonel Rufus ;
N Elwell Collector of Customs at Ports-;
mouth, stated that he had received a cir
cular letter from William b. Thayer,
treasurer of the Republican State Com- j
mittee, asking for a contribution to carry
on the committee's work.
Senator Chandler then came forward
with his statement, which he prefaced by
a short history of his connection with the
political committee. He said he retired
from the Republican National Committee
in 1884 and from the State Committee in
IS9O. Senator Chandler continued:
'â¢1 said to Senator Gallinger in lS&o and
again in 1596, that he ought to leave the
State committee for reasons connected
with the civil service law, but he would
not do it. In IX9B. much to my surprise,
he took the chairmanship of the State
committee. After- 1 had recovered from
my surprise 1 went to him to endeavor to
co-operate in the work of the campaign.
We talked over the means of raising
money, both agreeing that very little
would be needed. We spoke of individ
uals of nominees for State offices, but
nothing was said of Federal officeholders.
This was on October 10. Between that
time and October IT I heard that an as
sessment circular had been sent to Fed
eral officeholders. Governor Busiel asked
me If I knew of this assessment. Ho
said that he had reason to believe that
a circular for assessment had been sent
i,, officeholders and he produced a cir
cular which had been sent to State oftt
cers and said that some of them had
been sent to Federal officeholders. We
had a long conference, the result of which
was that he said he would complain to
the civil service commission unless some
other way could be found to prevent these
officers from being assessed. Accordine
iv Governor Busiel, with my knowledge,
asked the commission about the terms of
the law He came to me later and said
that he had determined to make a com
' plaint In this I concurred and the letter
i of October 24 was prepared, containing
! the names of those to whom it was be
lieved that the circular had been sent. I
did not go again to the commission during
I the campaign. The report of my con
nection with the business was all in the
correspondence with the commission. I
called on the commissioners when I went
to Washington last fall and told them I
would be at their service. This is sub-
Btantially all I wish to say. If I find that
! the Federal officeholders who have been
' requested by the commission to appear
i here do not come, or if they come and do
1 not testify 1 shall tell t"he commission
all I know about the matter."
At the conclusion of Senator Chandlers
statement he exchanged some warm
words with Senator Gallinger on his (Sen
ator Chandler's) contribution to the party
, fun. ls in 18M and 1596.
James O L>yford, naval officer at the
I port of Boston, was the last witness and
testified to receiving the circular from
Treasurer Thayer. He also stated that
the assessment circular was sent to Fed
-1 eral officeholders in 1896. The commission
| then adjourned until to-morrow.

DAWSONITES GLAD
TO FLOCK TO THE
NEW GOLD FIELDS
Tactics of the Dominion in Re=
serving the Best Claims Drive
Many to Cape Nome.
By SAM W. WALL.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
DAWSON, N. W. T., June 20.â Reports
of rich findings of gold at Cape Nome,
near the mouth of the Yukon, which
reached here only a few days ago, are
attracting great numbers of prospectors
from this place and from all along the
river. Readier credence is given the story
than would be the case were not the
hitherto unsuccessful prospectors so
.thoroughly disgusted with the shifting,
uncertain but always burdensome regu
lations that govern here. It is of course
the unsuccessful prospectors who are
leaving, in the main, but many also who
have met with a considerable measure
of success here are joining the stampede.
It may be said that news that might be
absolutely relied upon reporting rich dig
gings on the American side would almost
depopulate this city and these diggings
so entirely disheartened are the long
suffering and patient miners here. The
peremptory withdrawal of El Dorado and
Bonanza creeks from location by the
public has brought an armj' of prospect
ors to town, who have been employed
along the hillsides and in the pups and
gulches of those two creeks. They would
have remained digging and searching
along the margins of these rich pay
streaks all summer, but, almost to a man,
these people have bought tickets for
down the river. The town and the entire
diggings, especially the diggings, the
backbone of the whole thing, are in a
state of nervous prostration resulting
from the reports that follow one another
in quick succession and which gain ready
credence since this remarkable order, at
first laughed at as Impossible of belief,
has been certified by the authorities as
a fact. It is reported that other creeks
are about to be closed and the latest is
that after a certain date no more miners'
licenses or renewals of claims will be
issued. The authorities here, being ques
tioned, can only say that they know of
no such proposed changes, but inasmucn
as they did not know, or say they did not
know, of the order closing El Dorado and
Bonanza until they tore open the en
velope in which the order was contained,
this is not satisfying. The demoralizing
effect on the camp can hardly be overes
timated. . , m ..
What substance there is back of the
story that comes from St. Michael or
Cape Nome I do not know. The geneial
disposition is to charge it to the trans
portation companies, which are aheauy
benefiting so largely by it. Three steam
ers that have gone down the river since
transportation opened were crowded. Tho
up-river traffic has opened disastrously.
The James Donvllle. under charter at

IN SYMPATHY WITH
ANTI-TRUST MOVEMENT
Attorney Generals Who Favor the
Proposed Conference at St.

AUSTIN. Tex., July 11.â Attorney Gen
eral T. S. Smith received a letter to-day
from Attorney General F. 8. Monett of
Ohio, in response to an Invitation to at
tend the proposed anti-trust conference
of Governors and Attorney Generals to
be held In St. Louis September 20, as
follows:
"I am heartily in sympathy with this
movement or any other movement that
may tend to alleviate the present evils
or destroy the power of monopoly by pro
viding adequate remedies with which to
meet these questions. I hoped to be
present at this time, but will be on my
summer vacation. Smith W. Bennett of
this office, who has been associated with
me in the line of work that will be dis
cussed at the convention, will be present
and prepared to take part in the pro
gramme, and \v\\\ represent me In what
he may say."

The Canadian has since arrived from
the lakes bringing about two tons of mail,
the first to arrive since the trail over the
ice became impassable.
Fire has made another terrible visita
tion to the city, this time attacking the
cabins of the residents on the hillside
back of the town. Something over sixty
cabins with their contents and caches
were entirely destroyed. The blaze ran
through the moss and underbrush from a
campfire and spread over 200 acres, de
stroying nearly all the buildings in the
area. Many of the owners of the cabins
destroyed were absent at work in the
mines, and some probably do not yet
know of their loss. Among the sufferers

ARMY TRANSPORTS
WILL NOW BE ARMED
NEW YORK. July 11.â A special to the
Sun from Washington says: The Navy
Department has consented to turn over
to the Ordnance Bureau of the army six
teen six-pounder rifles for use on army
transports engaged in carrying troops to
and from the Philippines. The troop
ships have been "entirely without arma
ment.
It was said to-day by army officers that
if the Filininos had been enterprising
enough to mount on a ship some of the
guns they took from the Spanish gunboats
at Zaboango they might have captured
or destroyed some of the army transports.
One officer hinted that word had been re
ceived that the Filipinos were arming
some vessels and that this was the real
reason why the army transports were to
havo modern rifles.
The guns are at the Brooklyn Navy
yard, and will be shipped immediately
to the Washington ordnance factory for
some slight alterations before being in
stalled on board the transports at San
Francisco.
MRS. RICH CLAIMS TO

Mexico, was recently completed before |
the United States Commissioner at El â 
Paso, the case now being before the !

the information find papers hearing on the ,
case which had been placed in his hands
by Mrs. Rich, with the request that they j
be given careful and weighty considera
tion before judgment is finally passed on
the guilt of the accused woman. Mrs.
Rich claims that she is the object of
prejudice and persecution and that a plot i
exists to turn her over to the Mexican au- \
thoritles, regardless of her guilt or inno
cence. In order that she may be finally
bereft of her jewels and other property !
valued at several thousand dollars, which
are now in the hands of the Mexican au
thorities.

SECRETARY ALGER
IS YET DEFIANT
Needs More Than Hints
to Retire.
IGNORES OFFICIAL SNUBS
DENIES THAT HE HAS BEEN
ASKED TO KESIGN.
General Francis V. Greene of Hew
York Mentioned as a Probable
Successor to the Head of
the War Department.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALX. HEADQUARTERS, WELL
INGTON HOTEL, WASHINGTON.
July 11.â A member of the Cabinet said
to-night that Secretary Alger will be
probably given time to finish his an
nual reports, and that if he did not
voluntarily retire by that time, his res
ignation would be asked for.
However, Secretary Alger wants
something more than hints and official
snubs to induce him to give up the
War Department portfolio. He will re
fuse to consider many instances of of
ficial ostracism, so apparent to every
body, as an intimation that the Presi
dent desires him to volunteer his resig
nation, and he told a friend again to
day that he would not resign until he
had a direct statement from the Presi
dent that such action on his part would
be desirable. Under such circum
stances he said, he would not of course
refuse to resign, declaring that like
other Cabinet officers, his resignation
was always at the disposal of the Presi-
Concerning the recent situation in re
gard to his retirement, the Secretary
refused to make any public statement
beyond this one brief sentence: "I deny
emphatically the report that I have re
fused to resign or that the President
has intimated to me that he wants me
to resign."
It is apparent from this that the Sec
retary does not yet fully appreciate
what all of his colleagues in the Cabi
net do, and that is that the President
would gladly welcome his resignation.
He persists in declaring that some of
his enemies in the Cabinet are at thÂ»
bottom of all the reports circulated
about him. There is no doubt that
pressure to get the Secretary out of
the Cabinet will continue, and it is dif
ficult to see how the Secretary can
stand it much longer.
NEW YORK, July 11.â General Fran
cis V. Greene, according to a report
current here, may be asked by Presi
dent McKinley to succeed General Al
ger as Secretary of War. General
Greene conferred with Governor Roose
velt and Senator Platt to-day, but it
could not be learned whether his possi
ble appointment was discussed.
It is expected that the Secretaryship
will be given to New York, which has
had no representation in the Cabinet
since Secretary Bliss resigned.
HATRED OF CHURCHES.
William Steel's Will Gives Bitter
Token of His Prejudice.
SAN RAFAEL. July 11.â William Stool,
the late manager of the London ,and San.
Francisco Bank, during his life was noted
for the fervor with which he hatea
churches of ajl denominations and tUosÂ»
actively concerned in furthering their wel
fare. Two weeks ago Steel passed to his
final rest in Mill Valley, and. consistent
In his belief to the last, left behind him a
remarkable document in the shape of a
will, filed for probate to-day, which form--*
a monument to his undying detestation of
all that pertains to the external rites of
revealed religion.
The whole of the estate, valued a tSK"O.
--000, is left to his widow. Isabel. Steel, and
at her death what remains is to go to the
daughter of deceased. In the event of the
death of both the wife and daughter tha
property is to go to a Mrs. Little, a sister
of Steel. â ; Â«
In conclusion the body of the peculiar
document reads as follows:
And I make the special request that
my body be cremated, and that not one
copper coin of the income of my estate
"be expended upon or in any chapel or
church, or upon the support or encour
agement, directly or indirectly, of any
so-called minister of the gospel or mis
sionaries of any sect, for the whole of
which tribe I entertain a sincere and
well-founded and unconquerable aver
sion.
Attacked His Stepfather.
SAN RAFAEL. July 11.â Edward T. An
derson was arrested in San Francisco to
day by Constable Thomas Sutton on com
plaint of J. F. Boggren, his stepfather,
who charges the youth with assault with
a deadly weapon with intent to kill. The
principals in the affair live at Novato. It
seems from the story of the arresting offi
cer that young Anderson threw a stick of
stovewood at his stepfather as the out
come of a quarrel and struck him In the
head, inflicting a severe injury. Anderson
was taken before Justice C. Dahl at N'o
vato and his bail fixed at J250. In lieu of
this amount he was brought to this city
and placed in the custody or" Sheriff Tay
lor. He pleaded not guilty and will be
tried on July 2.".

REDDING, July 11.â The kissing bug
â that terror to timid women â is
spreading dismay in this "city. Three
cases of ugrly bites, or kisses, have been
developed in as many days, I^ast night
Maud Perry was stung on the lower
lip while in bed, and by morning her
lip was swollen to four times its nor
mal size. She did not know at the time
what stung her and a diligent search
failed to reveal the cause. In the morn
ing she arose and was stung a second
time, her right eye receiving th" pois
onous hite. She saw the bug. but be
fore she could kill it she was stung
again in the arm. Her flesh began to
swell so alarmingly that a physician
â was hastily summoned.
Miss Perry had crushed the bug to
a pulp, but from her description of rhe
insect Dr. A. 1.. Price unhesitatingly

STOCKTON. July 11.â John Herd Jr.,
son of John Herd, the capitalist who is
heavily interested in reclaiming projects,
is confined at Clark's Hospital here under
treatment for a mental trouble. Young-
Herd has been causing a vast amount of
trouble of late at Clifton Court, on Vic
toria Island, which is the headquarters
of the Old River Land and Reclamation
Company, of which hi? father is presi
dent. On Saturday night it was reported
a pitched battle was in progress between
him and some employes of the place, for
several of whom he had conceived a vio
lent hatred. Officers were sent to the
scene from both Martinez and Stockton,

Contra Costa County and, armed with
a pistol, threatened to kill James Oliver,
the foreman. Trouble was averted for a
short time. He then went to the other

but had McKinney had a rifle he prob
ably would have killed Herd.

had charge of it, refused to carry certain
people for whom he had no liking.

SHOWN POINTS OF INTEREST
ONE IMPORTANT RESULT OF
THEIR VISIT.
Elwood Meade May Be Sent by the
Government to Investigate
California's Irriga
tion System.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO, July 11.â As a result of the
visit of the Association of American
Agricultural Colleges and experiment
stations to this place there may be
brought about In California a complete
revision of the present irrigation sys
tem. Elwood Meade of the experiment
station. United States Department of
Agriculture, now stationed at Chey
enne, Wyo., is a Government expert on
irrigation. A committee of prominent
citizens of Fresno is considering the .
feasibility of getting the Government
to detail Meade to make a thorough in
vestigation of the State with a view to
having him make recommendations as
to a systematic improvement in the
present irrigation system, and also as
to whether the irrigation should be
under private or State ownership. The
matter is being conservatively discuss
ed by the citizens' committee, and it is
understood Meade will make his in
vestigation without any preconceived
ideas and report to the Government the
result. Mr. Meade says:
"In event of my being detailed to do
this work. I shall make an impartial
and disinterested investigation into the
conditions of the present irrigation sys
tem with a view to making recom
i mendations for a conservation and eco
i nomieal distribution of the water sup
ply, which I understand is not had at
present."
The private train of seven Pullmans
i having on board the delegates arrived
i here shortly after 8 o'clock this morn-
I ing. The visitors were met by Presi
dent Albert Lachman of the Califor
nia Winegrowers' Association and the

I which they were taken aboard another
| special train to the San Joaquin ice
factory and creamery. A short stay

which the visitors inspected the Malt
ermoro Company's St. George vine
yards, where they partook of light re
freshments.
A second special train conveyed the
delegates to the Caiwa Winery, where
{ they were tendered a luncheon by the
: California Wine Association. Presi- j
! dent J. E. Stubbs of the Agricultural

j moved a vote of thanks, which was
! unanimously adopted. William Han
i ford of the California Wine Associa
tion responded to th^ vote of thanks.
, Arthur R. Briggs on the part of the
| citizens' committee also expressed the
pleasure it had given the people of
Fresno to entertain the association.
In the evening a third excursion was
made to the Minnewawa Vineyard and
Kearney Ranch, which were inspected |
\ with gr^at interest by the visitors, j
The members of the association have \
been the guests of the Chamber of
Commerce, which is bearing the ex
pense of their entertainment here. The
delegates are praising California hos
pitality in the highest terms. F. S.
Scribner. agrastologist of the Depart
ment of Agriculture, Washington,
D. C. says:
"California, from all I have seen, \s
j the empiie State of the T'nion. It is a
i principality that could flourish inde
pendently ol the rest of the world.
Her*> you have everything in the
world."
The delegates remained at Fresno
until 10 o'clock to-night. \vh"n they left
for Â« Moville. which they will reach !
early to-morrow morning. Marys ville
and Woodland also will be visited to
morrow.

TRYING TO CONNECT MRS.
STOfiKE WITH MURDERS
Santa Barbara Authorities May Ac
cuss Her of the Killing- of the
Richardsons.
SANTA BARBARA, July 11.â The Santa
Barbara Authorities am about to take !
Btepfl to fasten the murrler of the Rieh
ardsons. three yeara apo. upon Mrs. Yda
Addis Storke, who yesterday was sen
tenced tQ San Quentin upon conviction nf
having libeled Dr. Windiest- r. Mrs.
Richardson and her daughter Ethel were !
murdered at their beautiful Mont eel to
home, ("ynis Bnrnard, an* employe at the
place, was killed while resisting arrest as
a suspect. The authorities believed at
that time that with his death the murder
was avenged. Now they are of the belief
thai Mrs. Storke planned the murder and
Barnard was her accomplice.
At the time of the discovery of Miss
Richardson's body In a field, on the morn- :
inp following the crime. Mrs. Storke was
almost thfv first person on the scene. She
declared she was there in <he role of a
detective and that she had been sent by
a citizen named Ivison. The latter de
clares that he never talked with her re
garding the crime, and that at the time
she appeared at the Richardson place he
did not know the murder had been com
mitted. The. recent attack by Mrs. Storke
upon tJrant Jackson is regarded as evi
dence that the woman is the victim of a
murderous mania.
More Union Bank Litigation.
SAN JOSE, July ILâ Suit was brought
to-day by H. A. Marckres for himself and
on behalf of all the depositors of the
J'nion Savings Bank to en.ioin the direct
ors and secretary of the bank from selling
the delinquent *tock on which assessment
lias been levied and is unpaid, advertised
for next Saturday. This sale, by taking
Stock from the hands of present holders,
would not o fly prevent collectirm of as
sessment but remove liability for $70 per
share still unpaid on the subscription con
tracts.
Tassajara Without Mail.
PLEASANTON. July 11. -A general tie
up of the Tassajara mail exists,- owing to
the fact that the contract made by J. A.
Harris a year ago expired on July 1. This
mail is transported by carrier between
I'leasanton and the Tassajara postoffice
dally, the distance being about twelve
miles. The contract was sublet to Harris
last year by the original contractor, re
siding in Sedalia, Ohio, who has the con
tract for a four-year term. Harris refuses
to renew his contract and no one else
cares to take it at the figureâ s24o a year.

THE DOLLAR LIMIT.
THE CALL has repeatedly invited the public at
tention to the fact that, in the municipal cam
paign of 1898, each political organization and
every candidate for a municipal office was pledged
to a rate of taxation for this fiscal year that should
not exceed one dollar in the hundred on an assumed
valuation of three hundred and fifty millions. This
pledge, simple, intelligible, incapable of evasion, was
emphatically the special capital of the fusion candi
date for Mayor and of the organ that supported him.
Every political idea that was incorporated into the
fusion platform was stamped into dust by the heels
of the voters. The one thing that lifted Mayor Phe
lan out of the crash and the ruin that befell his party
was his economical pledge, backed, as he expressed it,
by his official experience for two years.
There can be nothing simpler than a man's word.
He either keeps it or he breaks it. This was evident
ly the view of Mayor Phelan when he delivered his
second inaugural before the present Board of Super
visors. Now what is the meaning of the concerted
effort, pressed from a dozen quarters, to force a vio
lation of this pledge? The Republican members of
the board, fully sustained by the Republican press,
have refused even to consider any proposal to recede
from the obligation, either in the letter or in the
spirit. But the Democratic members show an in
clination to fall down. And Mayor Phelan, the Jupi
ter Tonans of the dollar limit, is oft on his vacation,
and. however much he may be entitled to rest, at a
' most critical moment palpably evades a situa
tion which, beyond all other public officials, he has
assisted to create. He has been invited, over and
over again, to reconcile his promises of public im
provements with his economical declarations, and to
make practical suggestions so as to avoid the emas
culation of any department of the municipal service.
But at the precise instant when he is wanted, just
when he could prove the reality of his position by re
ducing the generalities of a canvass to a business
level, he is absent.
The situation, especially on the fusion or Demo
cratic side, is unique. The Democratic Assessor be
lieves that under the new charter a rate of eighty
five cents on the one hundred dollars or thereabouts
ought to produce all the money that the municipality
needs to raise by taxation. The Republican Auditor,
Mr. Wells, thought that, in view of the frauds con
stantly perpetrated in the purchase of supplies, it
might be impossible to observe the dollar limit and
meet the exigencies of the various departments for
the present fiscal year. The real question seems to be
one of equalization, not only as respects the tax
payers, but in the division of the taxes. No citizen
is desirous to see the Fire Department, which has
done such excellent work in the past and upon which
the community so largely depends, reduced to a pov
erty that would impair its efficiency. But, on the
other hand, no citizen who has studied the facts con
siders that this is necessary. Let business methods
be employed, let the purchase of supplies be regulated
by ordinary rules and not used as a mode of sur
rendering public money without a just equivalent,
and, as Mr. Wells has logically proved, the appro
priations of past years can be largely reduced.
The fact is, and the community is impressed with
the belief, that this municipality can be easily run
within the dollar limit upon the valuation of three
hundred and fifty millions. There is no actual need
for all the fuss and disturbance that a simple proposal
to be commonly honest has engendered. The Super
visors themselves, with the aid of other municipal
officers, can scale down and apportion the appropria
tions so that the last half of this year and the first
half of next year will signalize a new departure that
involves' neither more nor less than decent treatment
of the people by the officers they have elected.
But the fusion organ and the fusion Supervisors
ought to stand up to the rack. And, in some way,
even at the expense of a slight curtailment of his va
cation, the benefit of Mayor Phelan's experience
should be obtained and he should be afforded a full
opportunity to fulfill his ante-election promises and to
prove that he has not done his political talking
through his hat.
Leon Dennery, true to the instincts developed un
der the wing of Dan Burns, has carried the habits of
the hoodlum into the offices of the Board of Health.
He tried a few of them yesterday on a caller. Now he
is having his face mended,
THE TRUTH ABOUT CUBA.
WE have recently referred to the attitude of the
United States, toward Cuba and to the opera
tions of the Cuban-American League, with
headquarters in New York. Much light is thrown on
this subject by an article in the current number of the
North American Review. The writer withholds his
name and signs himself, "One of the Army of Occu
! pation in Cuba."
He is evidently an army officer of high intelligence
| and one who clearly comprehends a soldier's duty to
| involve the upholding of his country's honor, in bat
' tie, in pledge-keeping, and in administration.
He says: "There can be no doubt that the pacifi
| cation of the island is now accomplished. City for
; city the towns of Cuba are more peaceful and or
j derly than those of the United States. There never
; was a more docile, quiet people. All the reports of
; brigandage are zealously forwarded to the United
; States, and half of them are lies. The Cubans can
! and will give themselves as good a government as
! have the petty republics of Central and South
â  America. They are impatient to undertake the con
i trol of their own affairs. The irritation of the Cubans
j against Americans and American military rule is daily
I increasing, and will inevitably presently find vent in
a revolt. To conclude, we are in a false position in
Cuba, a position which in its outcome may result in
| wounding our national pride. We have the choice of
two alternatives: Shall we drift, or shall we decide?
To decide; to carry out our promise at once; to take
our troops out of Cuba, leaving the people to gov
ern themselves until such time as they may prefer
annexation â that seems to be our proper course. To
drift means a struggle with a tremendous problem
J under disheartening conditions, trying to help this
people in the face of daily increasing opposition, in
gratitude, irritation, suspicion. It means the postpone
i ment of the settlement of problems connected with
! the material prosperity of the island. It means a
failure to fulfill a solemn pledge. Judging from what
we know of the ease with which revolutions are got
ten up in Spanish-American countries, to drift may |
eventually mean a revolt. And no matter how large
or how small a revolt against us in Cuba might be (it
often happens that the smallest bands are the most
! difficult to deal with), no glory would be ours in
: quelling it, whether we lost in the struggle tens, or
i thousands, or, like the Spaniards, tens of thousands,
: of men. And it will be time then for the enemies of our
1 republic to laugh, for the' Spanish will seem to have
I made good their claim that the war of 1808 was one
j o; pure aggression, inspired by the lust of territory.
It is certain that the question of Cuba overshadows in
gravity any other question now confronting this
country."
Coming from an officer who feels that the least
glorious of wars is that in which for greed the strong
crush the weak, these words of warning should be
J heard and quickly heeded.
Within a month The Call has presented a similar
i view of the same situation. The Cuban-American
League is using a bottomless fund of money in blunt
ing the American -conscience, and, as this soldier
says, by lies, seeking to make justification for viola
tion of the promises of Congress.
One of the highest evidences of the capacity and
cesirc of a people for self-government is their revolt
against military rule. That ours in Cuba is as dis
tasteful as that of Spain, to an unwilling people, is
proved by every sign visible on the island. This
member of our army of occupation sees it and feels
it, and sees that the most distasteful duty of a re
publican soldier is the holding of a protesting people
%in subjection until their friendship is turned to en
mity.
It is evidently the plan of the American pledge
breakers, who seek to tarnish their country's honor
in order to fill their pockets with spoils, to drift until
a revolt shall give excuse for establishing a pseudo
electorate, which will support annexation, while the
majority of the people are pinned down by American
bayonets and denied a voice in the disposition of their
country, their persons and their property.
It is time that those who have the power only to
carry out the orders of Congress and not to disobey
them should make a plain declaration to our own peo
ple and to the Cubans. We are already openly violat
ing the spirit of the Congressional declaration in
Porto Rico and the Philippines. Are we to add to
this the immeasurable dishonor of violating its letter
and spirit in Cuba?
Eighteen months ago great meetings were being
held in our cities, from Boston to San Francisco, in
favor of free and self-governing Cuba. Money was
contributed to free a people whom we are now hold
ing in the slavery of military rule. Would it not be
well to read again the speeches that were then being
made and the fervid resolutions then being passed,
and reassemble those patriotic gatherings to renew
the pledge we took for the independence and self
government of Cuba?
THE QISASTER AT NEWMAN.
BY the disastrous train wreck at Newman we are
brought once more to consider how far careless
persons are to be held responsible for the con
sequences of their carelessness. No one planned the
collision by which two people lost their lives and
thirteen were injured. It was an accident. There
remains, however, the question whether the accident
was unavoidable, or whether some one is to blame
for it.
Pursuing its usual policy, the railroad will of course
exert all its powers to prevent the public from learn
ing the truth of the circumstances under which the
accident occurred. The press will of course gather
evidence as best it can. It has already gathered
much, and doubtless will make known. all the essen
tial facts of the- calamity, but that will not be enough.
There should be a legal investigation, by which there
should be brought' out under oath testimony showing
exactly how the disaster occurred and who is respon
sible for it.
Two features of the accident show negligence car
ried to the extent of recklessness. First, the special
train was made up with the tourist sleeper next to
the tender of tliÂ£ locomotive, not a single baggage
or other car being interposed between them to break
the shock upon the sleeper in case of just such a col
lision as that which occurred. Second, the freight
train stood unflagge<J on the main track, with the
locomotive at the water tank, and the station signal
showed white, which means "clear track." Somebody
is responsible for the reckless way in which the train
was made up, and somebody is to blame for the dis
play of a clear track signal when the track was not
clear.
When questioned by a representative of The Call
as to the condition of the signal lights, the station
master said: "The station signals were out correct,
and if there is any blame it lies with those in charge
of the trains. My report will be made to my su
periors and to no one else.'.' He declined to even
state whether or not the red light should have been
displayed with a freight train on the main track and
a through special due at any moment.
It is not to be doubted that other officers and em
ployes of the road will do as the station-master has
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, WEDNESDAY, JULY 12, 1899.
done. They have stan-ding orders to that effect. Re
ports will be sent to the railroad managers. The in
vestigation by those officials will be a secret one; the
public will be kept in ignorance as far as the railroad
can do it. It is not unlikely they will try to get the
disaster disposed of as an "unavoidable accident," for
! which no one is to blame, and for which the railway
management cannot be held responsible.
It is against public policy to permit serious dis
asters to be set aside in such a summary way. No
one can have any desire to condemn any of the sub
ordinate employes of the road, who have the misfor
tune to be involved in the calamity, but who are in
r.o way responsible for it. For the purpose, there
fore, of ridding innocent persons of unjust suspicion,
the law should use its powers in disclosing the truth
and compelling the railroad officials to reveal what
they know of it. A comprehensive and penetrating
examination ought to be a part of the Corojier's in
quest. The cause of a calamity so dreadful should
not remain the secret of a railroad bureau.
THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES.
BY the force and the universality of the protests
made against the policy of voting a blanket
ticket at the primary elections the members of
the Republican County Committee have been duly
informed of the extent of their blunder in devising
such a policy. It is not too late for them to correct
the error. When the petition for the blanket ticket
comes up for consideration by the Election Commis
sioners the committee can withdraw the petition and
leave it for the Commissioners to arrange for the
elections in accordance with law.
â¢ If such a course be adopted the committee will go
far toward setting itself right before the public, and
it is but reasonable to presume it will do so. Noth
ing can be gained in politics by defying public
opinion. There is no profit to a party in alienating
the confidence of the rank and file on the very eve
of a campaign. At the time the blanket ticket scheme
â¢was devised the members of the committee -may not
have been aware of the opposition to it within the
party ranks. They are now, however, fully aware of
it, and not to withdraw it would be to persist in a
blunder even when known to be such.
In addition to the popular antagonism to the
scheme there is the further consideration that in the
opinion of many able lawyers a blanket ticket would
be invalid. That issue will be raised before the Elec
tion Commissioners if an attempt be made to uphold
the petition. There is no need for raising it. The
whole matter can be cleared by a withdrawal of the
ill-devised petition and a request that the Commis
sioners provide for the election by Assembly districts.
When once the blanket ticket scheme has been dis
posed of, the interest of the public will center in the
choice of Assembly district candidates for the county
convention. The very fact that the election of dele
gates is to be made by districts will tend to bring
about the election of truly representative men. It
â will not be so easy to procure the choice of unfit men
ct machine politicians by district voting as it would
have been under the blanket system. That is one of
the chief reasons why the better element of the party
has demanded election by districts, and it now re
mains for that element to profit by the advantage.
Every municipal election involves some issue of
notable importance to the community, but this one
has many such issues. Upon the officers who are to
be elected will devolve the duly of organizing the
government under the new charter and inaugurating
the new system of administration. It ' cannot be
doubted that it will be to the best interest of San
Francisco if that duty be intrusted to the Republican
party, nor is it to be disputed that the independent
"voters will gladly support the Republican candidates
if they are truly representative of genuine Repub
licanism. They will not support the ticket if it be
made up of men who represent only the domination
of the railroad and the cunning of Burns.
A clean ticket means a clean victory, but any other
kind means foul defeat. Let us have delegates to the
convention chosen by Assembly districts, worthy rep
resentatives of Republicanism, and a strong and
trustworthy ticket. Then the contest at the polls
need not be feared. In this issue the Republican
party can afford to defy the railroad and the bosses,
but it cannot afford to offend the people.
CALIFORNIA hardly needs make any elaborate
preparations to welcome the Oregon volunteers
when they arrive on their return from the Phil
ippines. â¢ The spontaneous enthusiasm of the people
for the heroes of the war with Spain, their pride in
the manhood of the Pacific Coast, and their general
delight in hospitality, are in themselves sufficient to
assure to the returning Oregonians, if the Govern
ment permit them to land here, a welcome that will
be notable in the annals of the city â one that the vol
unteers will talk of in their northern homes for years
to come.
Hardly less intense, and none the less cordial, than
the welcome which awaits the volunteers is that which
is extended to the Governor of Oregon and his mili
tary staff, who. have come to this city to receive the
heroes on their arrival. As Governor Geer has made
his visit informally, there will be of course, in ac
cordance with his wish, no public demonstration in
his honor. From the National Guard of the State
and from the State and civic officials, as \<fcll as from
private citizens, however, he will receive abundant
courtesies and hospitalities to attest the honor with
which California regards Oregon, and to prove the
thoroughness with which we sympathize with the
mission that brings him here.
Pacific Coast men, no matter from what State they
h,ail, can never feel other than at home in this city.
As the metropolis of this large section of the world,
San Francisco draws to herself enterprising men from
all the surrounding States, and they bring with them
the patriotisms of the localities from which they come.
Thus there is a strong . Oregon sentiment in San
Francisco, and Governor Geer and his gallant staff
can feel the influence of it in the welcome accorded
them. The record made by the Oregon -volunteers
during the war has added much to the prestige of the
Pacific Coast, and California, as the empire State of
the coast, can have nothing but welcome and hos
pitality for the volunteers themselves and for their
honored Governor.
Dispatches going the rounds of the anti-Alger press
teem with innuendo. A recent one, announcing the al
leged determination of the President to rid himself
at any cost of the Secretary of War, is headed, "He
Will Take the Bull by the Horns." Why will some
people not refrain from casting up that old beef
scandal?
The boy that didn't know it was loaded should be
made to pay the penalty of idiocy, if not that of crime.
With the fear of that punishment he might point the
gun at himself first.
The Kelly and Crimmins blankety-blank ticket is,
like charity, designed to cover a multitude of sins.

GENUINE SEA SERPENT
IN NEW YORK AQUARIUM
As the Sea Serpent Looks in the Tanks of the Aquarium.
Sketched From Life.
THE real thins in a BÂ«a serpent was added yesterday to the collection of fish
and reptiles at the aquarium in Battery Park, says the New York World.
It is known as a preen moray. and is the first of its kind ever exhibited in
this part of the country. In the West Indies, where it makes its home
among the coral reefs at the bottom of the ocean, it is known to the natives as
the devil's terror. They stand in great awe of these creatures, which are as
ugly as they are powerful and which are believed by many to be superhuman.
Curator 1,. B, ST>encer of the aquarium received the sea serpent yesterday
with nearly 100 other varieties of fish sent from the West Indies on the steamer
Orinoco. It was placed in one of the exhibition tanks in the afternoon and was
surrounded by a crowd Until closing time. The serpent is ahout seven feet lons
and about twenty-four inches in circumference. It has a sharp snout and nar
row jaws with small eyes set well down toward the point of the snout. Its
teeth are iike needles and slant backward, so that once it has its prey in its mouth
there is no escape.
The great strength of the beast and its, quickness and speed in the water lie in
a bmad dorsal tin extending the entire length of. its back. It belongs to the eel
family and lives mostly on smaller fish and crustaceans. The head in . certain
positions suggested the typical witch's head.
"We had great difficulty," said Curator Spencer, "in securing a green moray
because the natives of the West Indies stand in such terror of them. As it was,
we only got this one by offering a bonus for its capture. I am not sure how it
was caught, but I presume it was in a trap built on the same principle as a lob
ster pot. It showed the wonderful strength of its jaws while being transferred
to the steamer by snapping off the end of a plank that was placed over the tank
to prevent Its escape. The natives claim the bite of the fish is deadly poison,
but I am not so sure of that. We shall know more about the creature after we
have hnd him a little -longer."
Of the other specimens received many were rare. Their colors were as bril
liant and varied as those Â«f the birds of the tropics. Some were extremely oddâ
the' Scotch porgle, with his plaid skin; the cowflsh, with square, horned head,
and the "surgeon," who carries a sharp knife of horn in a groove in his side,
which he shoots out viciously when angered.
"It is the finest shipment of specimens we have ever received," said Professor
Spencer.

THE BAD LUCK OF THE PARIS
By an American Sean>an.
Capyrigh'ted, 1599, by Kate Elise Boyns.
Yesterday we were favored hy the East
ern dispatches with news of Captain Wat
kins' explanation of his great misfortune
in the loss of his command, and two offl
cors of the Federal Government have
aired their views as to his desert for the
accident. .
It seems to me I have a right to be
heard in Captain Watkins' defense. It
seems to me that I have a right to ask thÂ«
removal of the incompetent individuals
who punished himâ not because they pun
ished hlm-w-but Instances of gross lncapa
' bility should call for an iron hand.
This article is written by one who
knows a few more inches of that particular
part of the English coast than the ignorant
British admiral who declared that "an in
dividual who could not navigate any ship
from Cherbourg around the Lizard was
incapable of navigating anything any-

He has written up the story 'of the

to navigate a ship from Cherbourg: to the
Lizard with certainty, and to Squire
Thornton Stratford Lecky, the distin
guished author of "Wrinkles in Practical
Navigation"â a work which is supplied to
far more ships than "Sea Power"â l am
content to leave my right to Insult a non
sea-going admiral and to speak one word
In behalf of a badly treated man.
Of all the navigable channels in the
world the English is the most treacher
ous. That is why a couple of grand steam
ers lie on rocks near where I spent some
of my earlier years. The English Chan
nel is a funnel. When it has been blowing
hard from the north, from the south,
from the east or from the west for days
the currents in it ran no more oe depended
on than the top that a boy spins can be
depended on to land anywhere in par
ticular.
Let me Illustrate: A few years ago
(possibly fifteen) I was In command of
a steamship bound "up the channel.
Off Ushant a course was set for. Start
Point, a distance of, roughly, 125 miles.
At sunset the position was determined by
both stellar observation and a sounding
(that Godsend to the marftier the Sir
William Thomson's sounder being at my
disposal). The chief officer of the ship
quite as well, indeed better, locally ac
quainted than myselfâ rejoiced at the an
ticipation of a good run to Dartmouth
(for coal). In the early morning hours
it clouded over, but fog was not in evi
dence, and so I did not "bother the
bridge." When the Start light had failed
to make its appearance when due I wor
ried a little and when the watch was re
lieved at 4 a. in. binoculars were begin
ning to get polished every thirty seconds.
I decided to take a sounding and as was
my habitâ not a bad one, my marine
friendsâ l hied me to the chart room to
find 'out exactly what water we should
be In. Scarcely had my rulers got on
the chart when I heardâ almost concur
rentlyâ "Hard-a-starboard" and "Land
ahead." It took about a second to get
nn the bridge, and when the ship had
completed her semicircle the engines
were, of course, stopped. A sounding was
being taken by the chief officer and I am
open to confess until he brought the
"bottom" to me I knew not whether I
was near Alderney or on the English
coast. (It may be explained that red
sand is always found to some extent on
the southern side of this vicious channel
and never on the northern.) Where" was
I? Absolutely insklo Start Point and al
most on top of Bolt's Tail!
My experience In crossing the channel
it has been greater than that of any ten
admirals or seven inspectors of Bteam
vessels isâ that once inside "the race" off
Falmouth when it has been Mowing (and
it is not necessary that the gale has been
on the day immediately preceding) is that
it is "good-by" unless you use the lead.
If Captain Watkins did not use the load
he certainly is to be blamed, but why
Judgment should be passed on him by
men who aver that the "tide" must have
struck the Paris on her port bow Ch*>r
port stern and a â  trifle of the cur
rent having gone below for a rest pre
sumably)âwhen they show their ignor
ance of localities by not knowinc that
the Lizard lights in line lead absolutely
clear of the Manacles (they are about 230
feet above high water and cannot be seen
many a time and oft from where the
Paris lies), I think it right to ask why
are not competent naval officers appoint
ed to posts which they could and would
creditably fill?
It is fair to state that it was high water
at Brest, the standard port for that part
of the channel, at 0:32 and 6:4fi a. m. on the
morning the Paris struck. Whether she
struck at 1:15 or 7:15 (accounts differ)
matters not, but in any case it appears
to have been at nearly high water. It
may be that not quite a sufficient allow
ance was made for the inset.- but the al
most certainties are that one of the rushes
of water into that corner of the channel
(where I have marly lost my life a score
of times) is responsible for Captain Wat
kins' accident, and not carelessness or
bad judgment.
To conclude: These "Inspectors of steam
vessels" assert that his report is "meager
in detail." I wonder how he made a con
nected one at all. This man, whom I have
met but once and yet highly respect, is
an excellent seaman. He is to-day at an
utter loss to explain how he got his ship
where she unfortunately is; but I am
willing to gamble my reputation as a
marine critic â and that I value slightly â
that the milk in the cocoanut is in thia
article. _^__________
NEW PRESIDENT
OF STATE UNIVERSITY
BERKELEY, Cal., July 10. I*o9.
Editor The Callâ Dear Sir: As r.n.
alumnus of the University of California
and a reader of The *Call I wish to thank
you for the right stand you have taken
on the question of securing an able pres
ident for the university.
I hope that you will continue to assist
the members of the Board of Regents,
who are endeavoring to invest the presi
dency with adequate powers, and that
you will lose no opportunity to impress
on the recalcitrant members that by their
actions they are forcing the people of the
State, whether justly or unjustly, to re
gard them as reserving the power of ap
pointing for the benefit of their friends
and followers.
It is but reasonable to suppose that a
president whose whole time is spent in
overseeing the work of the faculty will he
better acquainted with the qualifications
of individuals on that staff than will be
a Board of Regents whose time and at
tention are absorbed in matters of their
own business.
Moreover, as his whole reputation de
pends on the effectiveness of the corps
which he directs, he may safely be trusted
with the best 4nterests of the university.
Yours respectfully. " CALIFORNIAN."

General Miles was present. There was
also a special board appointed by the
War Department at the request of the
chief of engineers to determine wheth
er the Lewis range finder is affected by
the blasts of near-by guns. A gun
was placed at a low angle and was
fired out to sea. The shell, emerging
from the rifle at a velocity of 2300 feet
a Becond, skimmed along the surface
of the water, thrice ricochetting with
out exploding. As the rifle was dis
charged some of the officers almost in
voluntarily dodged, and as the shell
struck the water General Miles ex
claimed:
â¢Why. it didn't explode!"
In ordinary warfare the shell would
be fitted with a detonating fuse, which
| would have exploded it on contact with
j any object, but the risk of blowing up
1 any vessel that might happen to be in
i the vicinity was considered too great,
'and. instead of the detonating fuse, a
plug was used. Heretofore with guns
firing explosives such as those on the

ENACTING THE GOLD
STANDARD INTO LAW
; It Is Believed That Democrats in Con
gress Will Champion the Sil
ver Issue in Vain.
! WASHINGTON, July 11.â Another Con
i gressional contest over the silver issue
i will be the result of the determination
I of the Republican caucus committee to
) report in favor of enacting the gold stand
' ard Into law. Among the few Democratic
; politicians now at Washington it is de
, dared that the issue will be cheerfully
| mot. Followers of Mr. Bryan will be
cularly pleased to have the issue
brought to* the front again, and there is
every pr^pp''""! of a heated debate in both
bouses of Congress.
Though Senator Chandler has declared
i his unwillingness to support any measure
i that makes the gold standard a law and
! takf-s it out of the power of the Demo
i cratlc or Populist President to bring the
; country to a silver basis, it is believed he
I will have few followers among the
[ straight-out Republicans. Some Senators
[ may insist on a declaration in favor of
the remonetization of silver by interna
tional agreement being incorporated in
any measure passed, and it Is highly
probable that such declaration may be
put into the proposed bill, but it will have
no effect in law and will be nothing more
than an expression of opinion.
The chances for an international agree
ment which were slim at the beginning
of the present administration, have grown
much less. The enormous increase in the
gold production of the world and evi
dence* that the increase Is to continue
have removed the strongest argument
that free silver men had that there was
not enough gold in the world to form the
basis of money systems.
Another Revere blow to the advocates
of' an international agreement is the an
nouncement from London that the British
Parliamentary committee on Indian cur
rency has reported in favor of the estab
lishment of a gold standard In India.
HARDSHIP ON SHEEPMEN.
Stanislaus Reservation Law Is Bit
terly Denounced.
SAN ANDREAS, July 11.â Assemblyman
Harvey S. Blood of this county, who waa
In San Andreas to-day, spoke unsparingly
in his denunciation of the Stanislaus res
ervation law. This law is provoking se
vere criticism by sheepmen and cattle
men. Alpine, Amador, Calaveras and
Tuolumne counties are the ones made to
suffer by this discrimination. Company A
of United States Cavalry is upon the res
ervation and mounted guards are contin
ually traversing the line, ordering back
the sheepmen. Cattlemen are allowed to
pass this year, but are warned against
coming next year. As the valleys will not
sustain the surplus herds of sheep and
cattle the law will cause hardship. Stock
men say they will go out of business, as
they will not be allowed to feed their
stock upon their own grounds in the
mountains. The Government has offered
to exchange land with those who are de
prived of thia right for other Government
laud outside the reservation. I

PUBLICATION OF TAX LISTS
SUPERVISORS MAY PATRONIZE
EACH PAPER.
Judge Lorig-an Decides They Have
the Authority to Place the
Printing With Whom
They Choose.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
I SAX JOSE, July 11.â The delinquent tax
I list will be "farmed out" among the varl
; ous weekly papers of the county by the
I Board of Supervisors. This was declared
to be a legal charge against the county by
Judge JLorigan to-day, and the proprietors
of some fifteen country weeklies will be
gainers of sums ranging from $16 to over
j $50. The decision was given in a suit
t brought in the Superior Court by S. T.
! Moore to compel County Auditor Morrison,
to pay a claim of $16 assigned to the
plaintiff by George A. Edes, proprietor of
I the Morgan Hill Sun.
For several years it has been the custom
! of the Board of Supervisors to order the
i publication of portions of the tax list of
I various townships in papers located in the
i townships, in addition to the publication
lin the county official paper. Some of tho
! taxpayers have objected to this, and this
i year they called District Attorney Camp
i bell's attention to the matter. This oili
i cial notified the Supervisors that it could
j not be made a legal charge against the
county, and warned the Auditor against
paying the claims. Moore then sued out a
writ of mandate compelling the Auditor to
pay the claims of the Morgan Hill Sun.
in his decision Judge Lorigan says:
"I nder the statute the Tax Collector ia
charged with the dut^ of publishing such
1 entire list as the official and legal publica
i tion but his duty to so select and pub
i lish is not exclusive. It does not preclude
the Board of Supervisors from directing
such further publication as will in the
i judgment of that body further the pur
i pose of giving notice to the taxpayers of
! their delinquency. A little reflection will
â¢ make it apparent that the printing of por-
I tions of the delinquent list in papers pub
lished in the various townships of tho
county is in harmony with a full discharge
of the duties of the Board of Supervisors,
and for the benefit of the county.
"The country has a particular interest in
seeing that its revenues are collected by
the taxpayers paying their portion of the
I assessed taxes, and as notice of delin
quency most, likely to be brought to the
attention of the taxpayers is designed to
accomplish that result, reasonable efforts
made in that direction by the Supervisors
are proper. It is obvious that this object
is best accomplished by the publication in
those papers which are published in tho
immediate vicinity of the residence of the
taxpayers, and the location of the prop
erty upon which the taxes are delinquent.
I am of the opinion that the Board of Su
pervisors had power to order the publica
tion."
Great interest centered in the case. The
Board of Supervisors had placed the price
of publication of the tax list at 86 cents
per name.
Nickel Machines Must Go.
SAN RAFAEL. July 11.â The nickcl-in
the-slot machine is doomed in this city.
A few weeks ago an ordinance was drawn
up by City Attorney Thomas P. Boyd and
Attorney Henry Eickhoff and presented to
the Board of Town Trustees for its con
sideration, making it a misdemeanor for
any person to have a slot machine about
his place for public use. It is said sev
eral business men who made use of the
machine were in favor of the adoption of
the ordinance on account of the demoral
izing effects of the machine on the youths
cf the community. Last night the ordi
nance was unanimously adopted by the
board, to go into effect next Thursday.

DENNERY MIXES
MATTERS WITH
ALFRED PATTON
Disgraceful Brawl at
Health Office.
NO BLOOD WAS SPILLED
QUARREL OCCURRED OVER A
SALARY DEMAND.
The Enraged Secretary Gave the Ex
rood Inspector Three Vicious
Slaps on the Wrist and
Friends Broke In.
In the picturesque but inelegant lan
guage of Port Warden Kenneally, hi.-;
friend Leon Dennery, secretary to the j
Board of Health, has "slopped over." The j
hot Dennery blood got the upper hand y> B
terday, and the hero of a dozen Tender
loin brawls sailed into ex-Food Inspector
A. T. Patton, struck him in the face with
a wad of paper and slapped him fiercely
on both wrists. The affair might have
been worse, but friends intervened.
Patton went to law over his discharge i
by the last Board of Health and got a j
verdict from the court ordering the board I
to reinstate him. The board, however, j
appealed, but Putton, as a matter of best !
policy, continued to report for duty in
the morning and leave his salary demand
at the end of the month. i
He turned up yesterday morning and of
fered his usual demand to Dennery. Den- j
nery declined to receive it. Then Patton
went to Garret McEnerney, who said he
would write a note to the secretary In i JC
planation. In the afternoon Patton again
went to Dennery and, tendered his demand. ;
It was again refused, and he tossed it on |
Dennery"s desk and turned to leave tho j
room. i
The fire-eating secretary came to the â 
conclusion that it was time to make
known that the dignity of the push could
i not be trifled with, and grabbing the de
i mand he leaped at Patton and with the ;
i folded paper slapped him a heavy blow on !
the left ear. Patton turned to see wl at
was going on, and saw Dennery arranging
his necktie for another swat. He antici
pated it with a stiff punch on the Jaw.
Though Dennery's breath was coming in
short pants from his first exertion he waa
by no means out, and succeeded in return-
Ing a hard right and left on each of Pat
ton's wrists. The battle was carried Into
the hall, where a crowd of jeering onlook
ers quickly gathered. No one interfered
until Dennery attempted to foul Patton
with a short-arm jab on the ankle, when
friends stepped in and put a stop to fur
ther damage.
The spectacle was hardly edifying from i
â  any point of view. The angry secretary |
] made use of about all the billingsgate he [
could muster after his late campaign with
Colonel Burns, and Patton was not trail- j
ing far behind him. Even after the two !
men were separated they continued to j
curse each other until dragged away In
different directions. That the row did not <
take on a more serious aspect is remark
! able, as Dennery is known as a vicious
! lighter under certain circumstances.
There were no arrests.
A NOTABLE EVENT
Monster Family Excursion to Santa
Cruz.
SPLENDID TRAINS OF FIRST
CLASS COACHES AND A
VERY LOW RATE
OF FARE.
A Good Opportunity to Enjoy the
Many Attractions of the City
by the Sea.
The Southern Pacific Company an
nounces that Sunday, the 23d inst., is
the date set apart for the great annual
excursion to Santa Cruz, and which
will enable excursionists to visit this
beautiful city by the sea during the
height of the summer season and par
ticipate with the thousands of other
visitors in the enjoyment of swimming,
boating, driving, etc.
Another very important attraction at
Santa Cruz at this time will be the
beautiful camp of the League of the
! Cross Cadets, numbering over 500.
As heretofore this great excursion
will be under the personal supervision
of Colonel William H. Mtnton, the
I well-known excursion passenger agent
of the Southern Pacific Company, who
will see to it that the excursionists are
well cared for.
These trains (the excursion being
run probably in three sections) will be
| run over the scenic narrow-gauge route
through the famous Santa Clara Val
ley and along the beautiful streams
which wind through the magnificent
redwood forests of the Santa Cruz
Mountains.
The round-trip rate for this occasion
has been placed at the very low price
r.f $2. and special excursion tickets will
be placed on sale at the Grand Hotel
ticket office on July 19, 20. 21 and 22.
and at the depot ticket office on the
morning of the excursion. Those in
tending to avail themselves of this op
portunity will take the 7:45 a. m. boat
from the San Francisco ferry landing.
Train leaves Fourteenth and Franklin
streets at 7:45 a. m. and from Alameda
(Park street) at 8:20 a. m. Returning,
excursionists will be landed at San
Francisco at 8:05 p. m.
SECURED A NEW TRIAL.
Supreme Court Awards Tax Collector
Johnson of Mendocino County
Another Hearing.
Ex-Tax Collector J. R. Johnson of Men
clno County was granted a new trial yes
terday by the Supreme Court. As Tax
Collector of the northern county it is al
leged he collected three thousand dollars
which was not turned into the county
treasury. Suit was brought by the coun
ty to recover the amount from his bonds
men and a decision was rendered against
the official. He appealed and the Supreme
Court reversed the judgment because the
court excluded evidence of certain sums
of money that he paid into the treasury,
which were shown by the Treasurer's re
ceipts. The reason given by the lower
court for excluding the testimony was
that it would not do the defendant any
good, because the plaintiff could by
amending his complaint charge and credit
the plaintiff with all sums collected by
him and paid into the treasury and there
would still be the three thousand dollar
item unaccounted for.
The Supreme Court held that the rejec
tion of evidence that was admittedly com
petent could not be satisfied by any such
ground. It, therefore, granted the ap
pellant a new trial.

Bidden Godspeed.
A FAREWELL RECEPTION
BIG GATHERING AT THE CEN
TRAL M. E. CHURCH.
Northern California's Representatives
to the Convention at Indian
apolis Listen to Words
of Advice.
The delegates from Northern California
to the session of the international conven
i tion of the Epworth League of the Mctho
| dist Episcopal Church, which convenes In
i Indianapolis next Wednesday, were given
an enthusiastic- farewell at the Central
Methodist Episcopal Church on Mission
street mar Seventh last evening. The
California delegation as a whole will work
. to secure the convention of 1901 for Call
! fornia, the question of whether it shall be
j held in San Francisco or Los Angeles to
be left for future decision as a matter of
I secondary importance.
The vestry of the church, in which the
j meeting was held, was well filled, among
those present being a number of Leaguers
from the towns on the other side of the
bay, Napa, San Jose and other places in
the interior, all anxious to testify their
interest in the movement and furnish in
spiration to the delegates on the eve of
', their departure on their important mis
sion, both by their presence and their
1 words of cheer.
C. H. Perkins presided and opened tne
! proceedings with a felicitous address
; which ;>ut everybody in good humor and
prepared the way for those who followed
him. Nearly all the delegates, with the
j exception of the Rev. Dr. W. W. Case,
j who is in the East, were present and oc
: cupied st-ats near the platform.
Rev. Dr. John A. B. Wilson was the
| first speaker and he declared that Cali
fornia, as one of the strongholds of the
leaguers, was a good place to hold the an
nual convention, and he had no doubt that
: the effort to bring it here would be suc
cessful if the proper amount of energy
' were expended in that direction. He was
j followed by Vi. H. Waste of Oakland,
!Dr Bovard, Mr. Morton of San Jose,
Mr Alexander of Livermore. T. B. Hutch
inson and Dr. "Williams of Napa. Dr. Ftl
i ben. Dr. J. N. Beard and Dr. Locke, All
the' speeches were short and all were
brim-full of eloquence and aroused un
bounded enthusiasm. Dr. Beard urged
everybody who was interested in the Cal
| iforriia branch of the league to give the
i delegates every assistance in his power,
I not only in words of encouragement be
fore their departure, but in letters of en
i eouragement after their arrival on the
' rield at Indianapolis.
Mr. Perkins announced that although
I Dr. Case was not present he had sent
word that the Leaguers of the Northwest,
or that part of the country formerly
known as the Northwest, up around St.
Paul and Minneapolis, were going to the
convention shouting "California and 1901."
and the announcement was received with
a burst of applause.
The delegates from the northern section
of the State are: Dr. W. W. Case, Dr. J.
N. Beard, Dr. Thomas Filben, Dr. J. C.
Simmons Dr. Thomas Boyers, Henry
i Morton, T. B. Hutchinson, Louis Norton
i and W. H. "Waste. Four of the delegates
! will leave for the East to-night and the
i remaining delegates will get away the last
j of the week.

Grand Secretary Lunstedt responded to
"The Native Sons." and his eloquent trib
ute to the members of the order was fol
lowed by the sing-ing of "When Dewey
Comes Home" by L. J. Johnson, all pres
ent joining in the chorus. Deputy Grand
President Pernau favored with a few re
marks. Dr. Bryant responded to "The
Ladies." who. by the way, were not pres

Ogilvie entertained with a vocal duet and
the last on the regular list was an expres

the members and the singing of "Just One

Stanford Parlor boys.

bout before the Olympic Club to-night.
Dlxon led the fighting from the sixth

comment of all. He would bring it from

In the first round Dixon forced mat

There was no damage. ,- <Â»â-â.â '
The second round was very fast, George

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JULY 12. 1599.
IN THE WORLD OF SPORT
THE SHAMROCK
IS PLACED IN
THE DRYDOCK
Preparing for Her
Trial Races.
NEEDED ALTERATIONS MADE
EACH MEMBER OF THE CREW
KEPT BUSY.
Sir Thomas Lipton Denies the Report
That the Challenger Has
Been Found
Leaking.
Special TMspateh to The Call.
SOUTHAMPTON, July II. â ThÂ« Britan
nia having left tho drydock. the Sham
rock has taken her place. All that can
I,? <spon of the cup challenger is her tow
ering topmast, which stands higher than
tho factory chimneys adjoining:. Sh.i is
jealously screened from all observation by
canvas coverings brought over irom Kat
sey's at Cowes.
The sailing spin with the Britannia will
take place one week from to-dny. Th-2
Prince of Wales' yacht has taken the up-
per moorings at Cowes, The people are \
becoming excited about the Shamrock.
All sorts of reports were about to-day,
nearly all of which were false. The crow
had been heard talking, and it was stated
that the yacht was going out again yes
terday, but nothing of the sort occurred.
She had two anchors down all day just
below Meteor, and within easy hailing
distance of her auxiliary, which is used
for the hands to sleep on and as a gen
eral storeroom.
Fays launch was running from the
shore to the Shamrock and back again
most of yesterday, bringing all kinds of
linings which have been found necessary
and the crew was kept hard at work stif
fening up the stays, shrouds and so forth,
and in a general way acquiring the high
ly necessary qualification of becoming at
home and making an Intimate acquain
tance with the ship.
I met a man yesterday who has seen
the construction of her steel mast. He
said it was made In plates fourteen feet
long, each plate- being in half circles and
then welded like the plates of a boiler.
They were polished and then painted. He
says such a mast Is unbreakable, and the
same applies to the gaff and boom. The
mainsail. It Is said, weighs a ton.
Sir Thomas Upton, aboard the Erin,
has taken his guests, Ix>rd and Lady
Clanwilliaxn, Lord and Lady Lovelace and
others away on a cruise. The Britannia
' was away yesterday afternoon, having
1 been recoppered and the gaff and boom
of hollow steel shipped.
The press continues to maintain the
fallacy that the trials between Britan
nia and Shamrock will be very signifl
cant. They will be to those who have an
Inside understanding in the matter, but
not to the public generally. Fife wishes â
and is clever enough â to baffle any pub
lic curiosity.
LONDON, July 11.â Sir Thomas Lipton
this evening informed the correspondent
of the Associated Press that there wa3
absolutely no foundation for the report
that the Shamrock was leaking. He says
she has been docked merely to have her
hull repolishpd, preparatory to the trial
with the Britannia.

SIX SAGEBRUSH
WHEELMEN MAKE
A RAPID JOURNEY
I Record Lowered Over
the Sierras.
CARSON TO SACRAMENTO
, ARE MEMBERS OF THE CARSON
ATHLETIC CLUB.
;R. J. Kelly, George Tranter, Tom
O'Hallorhan, Henry Burlington,
Al Karge and Jacob Mul
ler Tell Experiences.
Six wheelmen of the Carson City Ath
letic Club arrived in this city yesterday
morning yellow with mountain dust, after
having lowered all previous records of
bicycle trips from Carson, over the Sierras
!to Sacramento. The party consisted of
Reuben J. Kelly, George Tranter, Thomas
O'Hallorhan, Henry Burlington, Al Karge
i and Jacob Muller. All are expert wheel
< men and Kelly holds many championship
medals for racing events which have
taken place in the Sagebrush State.
Leaving Carson City. Nev., on Sunday
night about 10 o'clock the boys dismount
; ed in the capital city of California Mon
; day night shortly after 9 o'clock. The
exact time en route was twenty-three
hours and forty-two minutes. They cov
ered a distance of over 200 miles, follow
ing the railroad from Reno over the
mountains. The same journey has been
made before by way of Placerville, which
is a much easier route, by H. B. van Etten
of Carson City in exactly twenty-four
hours. The cyclers, who are in San b ran
cisco, will go on record as having eighteen
minutes advantage over all previous ef
forts between the two points.
In speaking of the trip the iNevadans
say that the poorest road encountered was :
a stretch of thirty-five miles in length be
tween Carson City and Reno. The road
bed forihe remainder of the way was lair
and easy on wheels. The steep climb to
Summit 'up the eastern slope of the moun
tain range consumed most of the time,
the drop clown the western slope over the
foothills being made at a rapid pace with
but few stops. The boys rode almost In
cessantly for the twenty-three hours, ;
without sleep, and hesitating only long i
enough to secure food. The citizens or
their native city turned out to witness
their departure and at Sacramento they
were accorded a royal reception by the
wheelmen of that town.
Each of the tourists wore the natty uni
form of the Carson City Athletic Club,
and when they passed up Market street
early yesterday morning, mounted on
their wheels, their paraphernalia was the
object of much admiration. It consists of |
pale-green Jerseys, on which is the em
blem of the club, with leggins to match, |
a white soft felt hat, bound with a green â 
ribbon. : " â  - .. ,
Before returning to Nevada the boys
will make a tour of the southern part of .
the State on their wheels. They are all
enthusiastic over good roads and are in
terested in a movement which will result
in the improvement of Nevada highways
for cycling purposes. They made a leis- ,
urely trip from Sacramento to Stockton
and thence to this city. The express sat
isfaction at the condition of the roads in

JEFFRIES WILL NOT BOX.
Refuses to Meet Jeffords and Stop
Him Inside Five Rounds.
The attempt to bring Champion J. .T.
Jeffries and Jim Jeffords together in a lim
ited-round boxing bout has resulted in :
failure. J. D. Gibbs, matchmaker of the
National Athletic Club, went to Stockton j
for Jeffords and returned to this city with
him yesterday.
Upon arrival here he found the Jefrms
people unwilling to make the match. It
was intended to hold it here next Tues- ,
day Jeffries to knock out his opponent in !
five' rounds. If the latter -stayed to thÂ«
end he was to receive $500. Jeffords is one >
of the big fellows. Stelzner, who has ;
boxed with all of them, pronounces him
the strongest of all the heavyweight box

The next monthly exhibition of the San !
Francisco Athletic Club will be held on
"Wednesday, the 19th inst. These affairs
are growing in popularity, the gymnasium
of the club proving incapable of holding ,
those who wish to witness the bouts. The j
principal event will be between Ed Toy
and George Baker, ten rounds. The
eight-round bouts are between Charles |
Vickers and Jack Innis; Henry Lewis and :
Charles Thurston, and Deacon Jones and
Snowball Crawford. As usual, Aleck
Greggains will referee.

will be held to-night in Pythian Castle.
The Winners' Stake will be the tid-bit of
the programme, bringing out the best
dogs in the champion class. The Reserve

the attraction. With the number of fast
youngsters coming up every day some
surprises are expected.

ARRIVES TO BID THE
OREGON BOYS WELCOME
GOVERNOR T. T. GEER.
GOVERNOR OEER, accompanied by his staff, arrived In this city by
rail yesterday morning. The purpose of his visit is to greet the re
turning Oregon volunteers. Immediately on the arrival of the Gov
ernor Adjutant General Beamans of California and Colonel J. F. Bur
gin welcomed the Governor and his staff and extended to them the
hospitality of the State. The distinguished party visited the Bohemian
and Union League clubs, and also paid its respects to General Shatter at the
headquarters of the Department of Caifornia.
In speaking of the proposed welcome to the Oregonians by the people of
San Francisco Governor Geer said he would be _ pleased if the soldiers were
given an opportunity to march through the streets of San Francisco, but ob
served that the question of leaving the ship was one that would have to be de
cided by the military authorities. He remarked that he would consult Colo
nel Somers when the troops arrived, and thought the prospects were good for
the troops leaving the ship for a short time.
Governor Geer said his State was proud of the record It made In the war.
It was gratified by the achievement of the Oregon volunteers in the field, and,
moreover, Oregon was highly delighted by the splendid record made by the
battleship named after the State.
Adjutant General Tuttle, chief of staff of the Governor, has held that
position for several years, having served under Governor Lord aa chief of staff.
Accompanying the Governor are the following members of his staff: Ad
jutant General B. B. Tuttle, Colonel D. M. Dunn, Colonel A. B. Gillis, Colonel
S. C. Spencer, Major J. M. I. Wood and Captain K. C. Mearns.
Last evening Governor Geer and bis staff were entertained by the members
of the staff .if Governor Gage, and to-day they will be_ offered such courtesies
as are compatible with the close watch they are keeping for reports of the
returning transports that are bringing home the brave boys of Oregon whom
they have come such a distance to greet.

THE LAMBARDI
COMPANY BIDS
THE CITY ADIEU
WHEN the curtain fell on the
"Barber of Seville" last even
ing at the California Theater
it marked the passing of the
Lambardi Grand Italian Opera
Company, for the presf-nt at least. That
it will soon return there is no doubt; in
fact arrangements for a return engage
ment have practically been settled by
Manager Friedlander of the California.
Saji Francisco awoke to the realization
last night that it was going to lose this
company, which has so favorably im
pressed the lovers of opera of this city,
and the first full house that has greeted
the company since it opened practically
unannounced in the Alhambra and began
Its peregrinations from theater to theater
gathered at the California. Never were
players greeted more warmly than those
of the Lambardi company last night. It
was an ovation, applause from the be
ginning assuming the volume of a din.
The impassioned, graceful singing of Sig
norina Repetto, who assumed the role of
Rosina; the full, round bass of Travaglini.
the spirited tenor of Russo, the clever
acting- of Bergrami and the mellow bary
tone of Vizzardelli threw the audience
into ecstacies. Through the evening the
admirers of the players togged a wealth
of flowers on the stage. Three curtain
calls was the rule of the evening and
the singers, inspired by the appreciation
of their listeners, sang as they have not
since they reached the city. Of
Rossini's opera, "The Barber of Seville,"
much has been said and the people know
the argument weli. but doubtless it will
be many months before it is sung again
in tnis city with such spirit and approval,

MRS. B. MONTI MIXES
THINGS ON THE STAND
NAUGHTY WIDOWS TESTIMONY
CONTRADICTED.
Lewis Street Residents Tell of the
Unhappy Relations Existing
Between Mrs. Kopp and
Her Husband.
Mrs. Bertha Monti has a bad memory.
What she testified to on the stand in the
Kopp murder case she is apt to forget
less than thirty minutes later, thereby in
volving Judge, attorneys and herself in
much useless argument. Mrs. Monti tes
tified yesterday morning that the only
time she had taken dinner with the mur
dered man was on the evening when Mrs.
Kopp had met them in the restaurant to
gether, the self-same evening that the
wife took his life because she "wanted
him for herself."
Mrs. Catherine Caganelli, proprietress
of the restaurant where Kopp was din
ing with Mrs. Monti on the fatal even
ing, testified that the widow came in fre
quently with Kopp to dinner. In fact,
they came in so frequently that the wit
ness learned to know them.
After Mrs. Caganelli left the stand
Judge Conlan recalled Mrs. Monti to ex
plain the testimony of the witness. "I
dined with Kopp many times," Mrs.
Monti said; "but only once since Mrs.
Kopp'a return from the East."
Mrs. Caganelli was recalled and posi
tively testified that she had seen Kopp
and Mrs. Monti "more than once and

a Pitchfork Into His Horse's
Leg.
Thf police are searching for Ben Sid

NO NONSENSE IN
DR. WHEELER'S
REQUIREMENTS
Wants No Log Rolling
With Regents.
HE INSPIRES CONFIDENCE:
CHATS WITH OFFICETtS AND
FBIENDS OF UNIVERSITY.
Belief That the Cornell Professor
Will Accept the Presidency of
tie Institution at
Berkeley.
Dr. Benjamin Ide Whaler, president- i
elect of the University of California, ar- â 
rived in the city from New York early ;
yesterday morning and attended a ses
sion of the regents In the afternoon. He j
will be in and about San Francisco for a j
week or ten days and during that time ;
will acquire facts concerning the uni- ,
versity and acsertain what views the ;
regents hold regarding the future man- j
agement of the institution. He may run
down to Los Angeles and pass a day with ;
the school teachers there assembled. Next i
Sunday he will be the guest of Mrs.
Hearst at her country home near Liver
more. She arrived in the city yesterday.
but did not attend the regular session of
the board of regents.
Dufing the forenoon yesterday Dr. j
"Wheeler met several of the regents at
theft respective offices. He chatted for a j
considerable time with General Barnes,
Judge Wallace, Arthur Rodgers, Judge
Waymire and Judge Slack. It is readily
acknowledged by the regents that Pro- i
fessor Wheeler is an impressive and In- I
spiring man. General Barnes fancies that
the students of Berkeley will be delighted j
with the Cornell professor. Before his
present visit ends Dr. Wheeler will in- j
form the regents whether he will accept
or decline the presidency of the uni
versity. In the minds of the regents there I
is hardly a doubt of his acceptance, but j
he desires to talk over affairs personally |
with each member of the board. Of course
these conversations will be In the nature
Of "heart to heart talks" for the good !
of the cause of higher education on this '
Bide of the continent. Dr. Wheeler is in '
no sense destitute of that quality known
as personal magnetism and if he pursues
his plan of campaign, which contemplates j
a personal Interview with each regent, I
he will surely capture the whole board, j
In general conversation yesterday Dr. I
Wheeler remarked: "My requests placed
before the regents are by no means un- |
usual. I do not believe that there should
be any logrolling on the part of any mem
ber of the faculty with the regents in
order to hold his position. I think my
requests have in a measure been misun
derstood. I do not believe in wholesale
decapitations. It is not the question of
one man's place or even two men's places.
Politics should not enter into the question
at all. So long as politics govern ap- |
polntments there will be no peace, no
quiet, no effective advancement."
General Barnes presided at the session
of the board yesterday. The Regents' at
tending were: Hallidie, Denicke, Budd,
Houghton. Wallace. Lieutenant Governor
Xeff, Speaker Alden Anderson. Rodgers,
Slack, Foote, Pardee and Barnes.
The board adopted the following reso
lution:
Resolved, With the concurrence of
the president of the board. Governor
of the State and the Speaker of the
Assembly and the consent of the State
Board of Examiners that the Commit
tee on Audit and Finance is hereby
authorized and directed to advance
from that portion of the university one
cent fund, set aside for permanent im
provements, so much as may be neces
sary to make up any deficit that may
occur in the revenue of the univereity
for current expenses, and to report the
same from time to time to tfct board.
A communication from Professor Wil
liam Cary Jones was received, wherein
was offered a donation of $3000 from Mrs.
Cornelius B. Houghton, to be used as a
scholarship. Mrs. Houghton expressed
the hope that at least $130 per year be
derived therefrom. The donation was ac
cepted and the board tendered its thanks
to the donor.
Director Keeler recommended the ap
pointment of three fellows at the Lick
Observatory, naming Messrs. Coddington,
Palmer, Rays. On motion of Regent Slack
the three gentlemen named were appoint
ed at a salary of $100 per year.
Dr. Pardee moved that General Barnes
be made chairman of the Lick Observa
tory Committee. The motion was carried
unanimously.
The board adjourned to meet next Tues
day, July IS, at 1 p. m., and confer with
Dr. Wheeler.

DRIED FRUIT IN NEW YORK.
The New York Commercial says: "During
the pa*t week there was some additional de
mand for old crop peaches. Some holders are
entirely cleaned out, and buyers appear to be
experiencing some difficulty in filling their re
quirements. There has been no increase In
price but everything new on the spot is heid
firmer, and the tendency of prices Is upward
on all grades. No sales of new crop for for
ward are reported. There Is an Impression
that the opening will be 6*@6*c, but this prlcÂ»
is not given as official.
"Spot apricots are In more active demand
and prices tend upward, though no quotable
advance in price hae yet been made. There
are few in first har.ds. except a few which
were reshlpped from France, and It ls Ba a
those are controlled by one or two firms. Â«oui
lng new has developed in business for forward.
There are offerings at about previous ranee or
prices, but it ls not known that any business
has been done. It seems to be generally con
ceded that there must be some shading or
prices before sales of any Importance are
"Prunes remain quiet and steady, with trade
suffering, because of competition with fresh
domestic fruits which are liked at this sea-
Croo reports do not vary much from
will' be larger, but Oregon and Washington
previous statements. The California output
trill have few to send out this season.
"The exports of prunes during the year end
ing June SO, LS9B, were 15,940,791 pounds. For
the first ten months of the year ending June
30. 1899, the export was 5,461.026 pounds, a
shortage of 10,479,765 pounds, or 440 cars. The
quant'ty r.ow held on the coast is estimated
at 300 cars or nenr that. These figures prove
that had the export demand been as large
as usual not a car would now be left. The
latest estimate on the IS9B crop in France is
23,000,000 pounds . compared with RS.OOO.OOii
pounds actual)'.- harvested last year. The 18W
crop was about 80.000,000 pounds. The indi
cations are therefore, that this year's de
mand will be quit- as large as in 1897. wnlch,
asbumir.g the present estimates of the prob
able output of Oregon and Washington to be
reasonably correct, will put California's pro
duct In an exceptionally strong position this
fall. '
"Trade in currants ls small. There is some
Inquiry for small Jobbing lots, but they do not
amount to much The retention law passed
to its third reading last week, but whether
the proposed banking clause was retained is
a question still undecided. The Cape Comorin
Is on the way with KWO barrels, which has
given the market an easier tone, but no quot
able change in price has occurred in spot
goods.
"Drought has injured the Smyrna fig crop,
and estimates are reduced to 80,000 came] loads,
a falling off as compared with previous esti
mates of 601 â¢ camel loads. The 30,000
loads 'will bÂ° about half an average crop, but
will be much better than last year."

FRUIT AND SALMON IN ENGLAND.
"California fruits continue In good demand
at firm rates. For the 1599 pack canners have
â¢withdrawn their offers, but resales have taken !
place at hardening rates," says the London j
Grocers' Gazette, and reports the salmon mar- i
ket aa follows: "There is no quotable change in !
this market. The consumptive demand has im- i
proved Flight!}-, but the Inquiry from first
hands is extremely limited, and as a matter
of fact dealers are in some cases offering at
Jower prices than those demanded by packers'
agents. The position of this market ls at the
present time a somewhat curious one. On the
r tip hand nackers state that prices must go
higher In consequence of the increased i
production, while the demand from the United
States for all classes of tinned provisions ls
at that packers can get their own prices
from that market. Many of the dealers and
wholesale houses here, however, take the op
posite view, being of opinion that the market
ls at present too high, and they support their
opinion by selling' from the stocks they hold
on hand at less than they can purchase at the
present moment."

EASTERN MARKETS
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, July 11.â stock market
â¢trlklngly demonstrated its Inherent strength
to-day with a practical recovery of yester
day's losses. The closing prices to-day were
only slightly below these or Saturday and in
some exceptional cases sharply above. The
only conditions in which any change had taken
place were purely technical. These were the
elimination of a weakly margined long ac
count and the creation of a short Interest.
London began to sell stocks in New York at
the opening to-day as it did yesterday, but
Instead of coming upon a large amount of
nearly exhausted margins, as was the case
yesterday, the opening decline Invited buying
to cover the short contracts put out yesterday.
The buying from this source afforded the prin
cipal support to the market In the early deal-
Ings It - was particularly marked In Sugar
and the New York Traction and Gas stocks,
â which suffered most severely from bear raid-
Ing yesterday. By the time this short Interest
had " been covered the market came to a
standstill, the bulls apparently lacking cour
age to push their advantage in the face of ihe
continued firmness of the money market, which
held quite firmly about the legal rate for call
money. Slightly before noon, however, a de
termined buying movement developed In the
great trunk lines and with occasional Intervals
â preadlnjr from out group to another
until It embraced pretty much the whole
other until It embraced pretty much the whole
list. The agreement among the trunk lines to
restore rates on grain to the seaboard was ap
parently the cause of the origin of the buying
In that group. St. Paul's increase In gross
earnings for the first week In July of $203,822
prompted .the buying of the Grangers. North
ern Pacific scored a brilliant advance, recov
ering more than its dividend, which was taken
off to-day. After a fractional reaction on pro
fessional profit-taking, prices were marked up
again to near the best In the closing dealings.
Bonds rallied somewhat from the early weak
ness in sympathy with stocks, but are slightly
lower on the day. Total sales par value
12,080.000.
United States new 4s registered declined %

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET. .
CHICAGO, July 11.â September wheat opened
about 4c lower, at 72%@73c. sold between 72% c
and 734 c, closed unchanged at 73c. Fair
weather In the wheat belt and continued large
primary receipts caused a degree of easiness at
the 3tart, and a decline followed the opening.
The decline was soon recovered. There was
irregular buying: by the less confident shorts,
who feared the influence of the Russian crop
failure, fresh confirmatory news of which was
received to-day, and the absence of Belling
pressure of note was sufficient to sustain
prices. The market, however, was exceedingly
narrow and price changes small until after
noon, when trade broadened out somewhat.
Bradstreet reported 178,000 bushels decrease In
the world's visible... and reports were received
of damage to Wisconsin's spring wheat. The
price was advanced to 734 c, the highest point
of the day. Trade became dull again toward
the close, and the pit at times was half
empty, with the easiness usually a feature of
narrow trading.
Corn was dull, but fairly steady. Prices fol
lowed wheat, September closing unchanged.
Oats were extremely dull, but steady. Sep
tember closed Vsc lower than yesterday.
Provisions were firm and fairly active.
Speculative demand, both local and from out
side, was good, and prices averaged slightly
higher all day. Packers were again in the mar
ket. At the close Sectember pork was 10c
Wisher and lard and ribs 5c higher.

BOSTON WOOL MARKET.
BOSTON, July â The wool market this
week continues strong and values are fully
maintained. The demand Is fairly good, but
represents speculative purchases by dealers as
well as buying for manufacturers. The bulk of

Including California, Texas and Oregon. The
total sales of these wools for the week footed
up to about 3,500,000 pounds, and the price ob
tained Is better for the good wools. For good
lots containing a fair amount of staple the
market is quotable on the scoured at 48@50c
for fine medium and fine, with choice staple
lines at &2Â©54 c. , ._.._,
Fleeces are quoted higher and some sales
have been made at the advance, but Territory
wools have had the bulk of the business for
many months past. Washed fleeces are quoted
about 1 cent higher in sympathy with other
: wools. Pulled wools hold firm, with prices
hardening on the finer grades, but coarser
wools are yet quieter.

WHEAT AND OTHER GRAINS.
WHEAT FREIGHTSâ market Is very
stiff and rising. Wheat Â«hips now command
?2s id, and a Barley ship has been taken at j
355. The demand for tonnage is good, and the |
situation is largely with the ships. The cnar- ;
tered Wheat fleet in port has a registered ton
nage of 41,600, against 9500 tons on the same ;
date last year; disengaged, 7600 tons, against
18,300; on the way to this port, 212,230 tons,
against 222.250. , â
WHEATâ The Afon A!aw takes for Cork .3,

The market continues tame and uninterest
ing. Chicago was dull without guiding indi
cations. The bears had the advantage and
hammered the market more or less. The bear
sentiment seems to be growing on account of
the lack of speculative support. The casn de
mand is poor. .
The local situation is governed by thÂ« otnera

HIDES, TALLOW, WOOL AND HOPS.
Hops can be sold at 12%0 for future delivery,
but the growers decline to accept this figure.
The advance in Wool has checked the de
mand, and the market Is quieter. Several de
scriptions are marked up, as will be seen.
The circular of Sumner &. Co. says of Hides.
"The Hide business has been quite acme
during the last month. Sales have been made
readily at advanced prices, and tanners have
bought freely, and as the inferior and lower
grades of Hides have been shipped to the east
ern market, there is little or no surplus stock
in the market. Harness and skirting leather
have 'been selling readily for the past few
months, and the better grade of Hides those
that are well taken off and free from brands
and damage, command liberal values. Â«et
Salted Heavy Steers are in demand _ for har
ness and. skirting leather. Wet Salted Medium
and Light Steers are active. Wet Salted Cows
tell readily at full prices. Wet baited Kip
Veal and Calf are very firm and rule at tun
rates. Dry Hides are firm. The prices for Dry
Flint Hides are very close to the values which
are obtainable In the East. Deer Skin* are
more active and values are made at higher ng
ures than before. We quote the summer and
medium skins in demand, and the winter poor
and thin skins are fairly active. Goat Skins ,
are very quiet, but small quantities come to
this market, and at present rew Goat bKins
as a rule are tanned in California.
â¢â¢During the past month Tallow has been
somewhat weaker, owing to large supplies com
ing in from California and the neighboring lo
calities. The market, however, la well sus
tained and prices firm, and In all probability
the present values will continue for some time

Harrison's circular says: "Since the Ala
meda left the following vessels have deliv
ered coal cargoes from Australia: Benares,
2365 tons; Springburn, 4131 tons; Amiral Troude,
2577 tons; Kufua E. Wood, 2120 tons; Hecla,
2132 tons; total. 13,325 tons. The number of
vessels chartered in Australia to load coal for
here Is about the same as when the last mall
left, footing up about 92,000 tons capacity. A
number of these will not arrive here this year.
The principal activity in the fuel line for the
moment Is the demand from Honolulu, engage
ments having been made this week for sev
eral vessels to load Colonial coal for Honolulu
into May. 1900. This strongly evidences the
scarcity of tonnage for early loading there,
and will divert orders to the British Columbia
collieries for early loadings to Hawaii, for
which extreme prices will be procurable. Busi
ness locally Is fair, and prices are well sus
tained. Coal freights from Newcastle and Syd
ney are firmly held, so that any cheap fuel
from those sections cannot be looked for for
several months at least. Outward grain freights
are strengthening, which should in ordinary
seasons cause an Influx of low priced coals,
but there seems to be a very active demand
for tonnage all over the world, hence this will
not be the year for low freights from any
sections." ' . '

LIFE SECRET
REVEALED BY
A BURGLARY
A Deserted Wife in
Distant England.
Penitence and Affection Breathe in
Every Line of a Letter Thrown
1 Away by the
Thief.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, July 11.
"â¢That's a chapter of ray life that I
wished to never hear of again." said
Harry Kelly as he walked into the police
station to-night.
And the uphappy romance was all
brought to light by a little robbery that
took place at the Dewey Theater five
mor.ihs ago.
This afternoon a bundle of letters and
an old coat were found near Adams
Wharf. It was at once assumed that they
belonged to some one who had committed I
suicide and were taken to the police sta
tion, where policemen and reporters
delved into the secrets of the owner, who
was supposed to be at the bottom of the
bay. The story of the mystery of the
wharf was soon heard of by Harry Kelly,
property man of the Dewey Theater. He
at once detected som^ similarity between
the recovered articles and - me he had
!'-.st months ago. Especially he remem
bered a letter holding the secret of two
lives and commencing "Dearest Harry."
One glance at the apparent trash was
enough for Kelly. He at once identified
it as that which' was stolen from him.
One Of the letters possessed a strange
fascination for him. He looked over it
carefully and said: "That Is from my
wife. I wanted that chapter of my life
kept a secret."
And this is the letter:
3S Chalkfarm Road. London. N. W.
Dearest Harry: I was so glad to
â¢ hear from yon. I have been worried
while you are all those miles away.
Th^re Is no telling what is happening
to you. The enclosed I cut out of a
paper, and nothing could make me
forget it, for I thought it must be the i
place- where you were. I have gone
aeaily silly thinking about it. Often
'. lav and think of you and cry nearly
tll night, and then I feel so ill and
worn out in the morning, and there is
no or.c I can speak to about it only
Lizzie. You ask me if,l am ill. I am
in mind, and that i? worse than being
ill in body. I am not bodily 111. but I
have r.ot the strength I used to have.
I want to ask you something. Dear,
will you come to me? Only think,
Harry, what It would mean "â  us
bothâ an end to all this misery of be
ing- rated. Picture to yourself a
comfortable home with a loving wife
to do all for you that she is able to
do* and more even, to make up for all
past wrong. For my sake, dear, give
me some hope. Send me a promise.
I will help you all -I can. Do take care
of yourself, and I will try to do as you
tell me and cheer up. but I shall watch '
for a letter. I should like any style
of photo. Do write by return mail.
Harry, if I could only put my arms
around your neck and kiss you a_s I
used to, I think you would grant the
wish of your ever-loving wife.
EMMA.
With a little encouragement â  Harry
Kei'y told the rest of the unhappy ro

COLGAN REFUSES TO
SEND COIN FOR TEACHERS
OAKLAND, July Alameda County
schoolteachers may have to wait for their
pay. The deadlock is due to Assessor
Dalton's action in deducting about $600
from the taxes due the State, claiming the
money as commissions due him.
The situation is an interesting one and
will probably have to go to the Supreme
Court, unless the Assessor yields up the
withheld money under protest. Mr. Col
fan will not settle with Alameda Count
because be claims more coin than the
County Treasurer tendered. Alameda
owes the State $61,342, but the Controller
refused to receive it when County Treas
urer Feidler took It to Sacramento. It
â xas brought back to Oakland and is still
in the county treasury.
Yesterday State School Superintendent
Kirk apportioned the money to the vari
ous counties. Alameda's share Is JSI.TSI,
and Mr. Colon has refused to draw the
â warrant until Alameda County has paid
the full amount which he declares is due.
Mr. Dalton says that his attorneys have
sd vised him that he is entitled by law to
the commissions he has deducted and he
proposes to retain them.

Cruel Treatment of

eighteen years old. Aa a n suit of the
treatment he received and fright which
followed the threats of the torturers the
lad is temporarily deranged and con

There is no apparent reason for the
J brutality shown by Hanlan and Gold- ;

i lan began sharpening h!s knife, the in
: human pair keeping up the while a con

of their vtctitn.
Telling him that his ears would have
to go first, Hanlan passed the back of
j his knife across the flesh. The boy's
sensations can better be imagined than
ribed. He thought he had been de
prived of his ears and gave a piercing
yell. Fearing that his screams would at

over the boy's mouth and Hanlan pro

mornir.g. They pleaded not guilty to the

The Rea boy has not yet recovered
from his fright. He is almost a mental
wreck. He refuses to go outside of'
1 his father's house and insists that some
i member of the family be with him contin

Goldstone and Hanlan claim they had

OAKLAND
Gracie has endured the most fearful
bgoay. From fully half the surface
of her body the flesh was so badly
burned that it fell away, and the lit
tle 4-year-old girl bore her suffering
heroically.
It is a mystery to her parents how
Gracie procured the matches which
caused her death. They have always
been kept cut of the children's way.
and yet the little girl had a handful
on the steps in front of the house last
evening. She was playing with her
older brother when some of the

Young on Clay street and taken to the
California-street station. The information
of his capture was telephoned, to the
County Jail and Captain of the Guard
Louis Sartoris of the Broadway Jail re
moved him shortly afterward from the
station. Bradv's escape was a clever one,
it being through one of the hospital win
dows on the very day when the authori
ties were about to remove him to the jail
to serve his sentence. .

HANNA NOT IN DISFAVOR.
NEW YORK, July 11.â A special to
the Herald from the Isle of Shoal?. N.
H.. says: H. C. Payne, the Wisconsin
member of the Republican National
Committee, said to-day when asked
about Senator Hanna:
"I have observed some discussion in
the press in connection with Senator
Hanna on the management of the next
Republican national campaign, the in
timation being thrown out that there Is
some feeling against him in the na
tional committee. If there is I am not
aware of it. There has been no meet
ing of the national committee, hence no
opportunity for official discussion, and
anything that is said concerning the
sentiment of the committee is purely
conjectural. I have no sympathy with
the criticisms or attacks that have
been made on Senator Hanna. I would
not want to be chairman of the com
mittee."
Oil to Be Used on Roads.
BAKERSFIELD. July 11.â Th- Super

for roadmaking. A mile of the worst
road in the vaÃey will be thoroughly
sprinkled with crude oil to set if it ivill
lay the dust and prevent dry rut 3. Some
wells in this county produce heavy r. II
â with asphalt base. This will be used in
the belief that it will form with the dust
and sand on the roads a sort of bitu

County, where oil was used this
summer, indicate that it ia a success.

SHE MAY COME
BACK TO SEEK
BLOODY REVENGE
Madame Montague Is
Coming West.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
MC Broadway, July 11.
Madame Florence Montague, the very
romantic lecturer and former president of
the Oakland Psychic Society, is expected
to return to the coast in a few weeks. One
of her friends, with whom she has con- â 
tinually corresponded, says that the ma-l
ame, who has been to England, might be :
here within a month.
When Madame Montague-Yates arrives
here there is likely to be trouble. Since
she left she has, according to her own
statements, been divorced from Mr. Yates
against her will. There is reason to be
lieve, however, that the madame. when
making these statements, as she had done
very forcibly in her correspondence, has
been romancing, for since her sensational
letter was published in The Call a few \
months Ago, the fees of the attorneys and
the court connected with her divorce pro- i
ceedings have all been paid, which would
not have been the case had the lady not ;
consented.
Am matters now stand, according I
madame's signed statement, she has re
joined her husband from whom she has
been divorced, and she Is harboring
vengeance against those who manipulate!
the separation. Acquaintances of hers in
Oakland and San Francisco, who know
her well, think that her remarkable letter
berating her former friends and declar
ing that Judge Hall was induced to issue
a decree by reason of fraud, must have
been written subject to some "inspira
tion" which does not conform with the
facts.
Madame Montague's attornoy. George
de Golia. says that the legal bisiness has
been closed up and the lady has settled ;
ail the expenses of the contest and that j
he is totally at a losjs to understand what !
she meant by her strange statements.
Should the madame return to Oakland |
her homecoming will be the signal for
, some lively incidents, and it has been pre- {
dieted that her excitable French dispo- j
sition may prompt her to do a little gun- i
nlng. y
SURETY MUST PAY.
Judge Hebbard Decides a Case of In- â¢
terest to Builders.
A decision of interest to laborers and I
material men was handed down by Judge
Hebbard yesterday in the action of Wil
liam Shaunessy and N. Parrish, under
thr firm name of N. Parrish & Co..
against the American Surety Company.
In fche complaint it was set forth that !
on August fc IM. C W. Tuttle entered !
into a contract with Herbert A. Smith, in
which the former agreed to erect a build- :
ing for the latter in Colusa. the price
being $6600. To insure material men and
laborer* who constructed the building
Smith gave a bond for $lÂ»i50, on which
the American Surety Company appeared
- - ret}-. The building completed, the i
equalisation of accounts showed that '
Smith was indebted to N\ Parrish \
fir the sum of $1217 for material fur- i
nishPd. As this bill was not paid by j
Smith, suit was tiled against the surety â 
company to recover. Aft^r a long tech- i
nical fight the case finally went to trial '<â 
rday, and Judge Hebbard after the i
claim had been proved gnve jud^m^nt for !
the plaintiff for $1217 and costs of suit. I
The surety company must now look to ;
Smith for payment.
The points involved in the case, it is
â aid, were never decided in the courts of '
this city before, and hence considerable

OAKLAND POLICE
ARE PUZZLING
OVER A MYSTERY
Jack Stanton's Skull
Crushed.
Injured Man Walks to the Hospital,
but His Lips Are Sealed and
He Is Unable to Give Ac
count of the Affair.
"Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
SQB Broadway, July 11.
An air of deepest mystery, surrounds
the case of Jack Stanton, a roaming
waiter and cook, who at about 7 o'clock i
this morning walked into the Receiving
Hospital to be treated for a compound j
fracture of the skull.
How he sustained the injury that may
prove fatal is not known. When asked
by Steward Borchert, Stanton tried to
speak, but his lips seemed sealed, for the
injury to his brain had affected the nerve
controlling the power of speech, and he
seemed semi-unconscious, though he pos
sessed the presence of mind to hasten to
'. the place where relief might be afforded
him.
: On a slip of paper he slowly wrote these
words rather unintelligibly: "runaway
was in Oakland. J. Stanton." Then his
strength failed him and he dropped the
pencil.
From a wound at the left side of the
head bicod trickled down and was satu
rating his clothes. The case so puzzled
the hospital steward that the latter
promptly summoned Dr. Porter and later
Drs. Milton and Rowe.
After Stanton was put under the influ
ence of anesthetics Dr. Porter laid open
the scalp, when the seriousness of the
Injuri23 appeared. The doctors found very
little hemorrhage. The skull was badly
fractured.- while the wound through the
scalp appeared only as large as a silver
quarter. There was also a slight wound
on the top of his head, It was found nec
essary to remove several pieces of the
shattered bone and about an ounce of
brain matter. The operation lasted over
two hours and the doctors express little
hope for his recovery.
There are many conjectures as to how
Stanton received' his injury, which bears
the appearance of having been inflicted
with a hammer. Then again, it is thoiight
that he fell out of a wagon, his head
striking upon a sharp, small rock. Others
go so far as to say that the element of
murder may be involved.
Stanton was later in the day identified
by Dave Smith, a waiter at the Philadel
: phia restaurant on Broadway, where the
i injured man had been employed in the
same capacity several months ago.
"Stanton was a drinking man," said
Smith "and when in his cups he was ex
ceedingly quarrelsome. I feel almost sure
that his injury is the result of an early
morning right. I had trouble with him
at the restaurant when he worked there
for a short time and that's why he quit
Chief of Police Hodgkins has detailed
Detectives Holland and Quigley to inves
tigate the case, but after working all day
on the matter report it difficult to gather
any facts. No runaways have been heard
of and thus far no one has been found
who can give any facts further than those
already related.
Stanton is about -4 years of age. It is
said that he has a wife living in this city,
but the name "J. Stanton" does not ap
pear in the directory, and he is supposed
to have come here recently from Santa
Cruz, where his father is a printer on the
I Sentinel, and where his mother conducts
the Duncan House. Judging from the
i notes in a diary, found on Stanton, giving
a record of his doings and travels, he has
been wandering all over the State. In his
pockets were also found a comb, cake of
soap, razor and strap, in short, the com
plete outfit of a wanderer of the road.
At the hospital he appeared in a neat
suit of clothes and there was no dirt or
dust to indicate that he had rolled in the
roadway. ,

CORPORATIONS
ARE CITED TO
SHOW CAUSE
Must Explain Small
Tax Payments.
WELLS-FARGO HOTLY GRILLED
SUPERVISORS SIT AS A BOARD
OF EQUALIZATION.
Protests Against Erroneous Assess
ments Coming la in Bunches,
but in Most Cases Assess
or's Figures Stand.
The banks and quasi-public corpora
tions are to be hard put to it to explain
just why they should not shoulder their
just -share of the taxes that are this year
to be paid into this city and county. It j
| is the opinion of Assessor Dodge that he
; has about everything assessed that can
j be touched under the law or which has
not been converted into drafts and de
i posited temporarily with foreign eorre
j spondents of local banking institutions,
but the Supervisors have an idea that
they may find a way to go him one bet
ter, and to this end they yesterday
adopted a resolution citing about every
banking institution, public or private,
and money broker of importance in this
city to appear before them while sitting
as a Board of Equalization and show
cause why their assessments shall not
go up.
"Tackle it if you want to," said Asses
sor Dodge to them yesterday. "I have
spent the better part of a month in go
ing over their books, and in some easeg
i they have openjy laughed at me. I have
got them assessed as close as they can
! be, considering, of course, legal exemp
j tions and their ability to evade taxation
ion certain classes of collateral. Its the
I private banking firms we are afraid of.
The man around the corner who may be
using $3,000,000 or $4,000,000 in his busi
ness but who renders a statement to me
of only $100,000, the law does not give
me the right to inspect his books and I
j can do nothing with him."
The board agreed with Assessor
Dodge that he probably had every
thing charged against the corpora
i tlona that he could find, but at the
I same time thought it would be as
j well to have them all up and question
; them as to their franchises. Consequent
ly Mr. Algeltinger offered a resolution
calling upon them to appear on the morn
ing of the 14th and show cause. Only
Lackmann and Heyer voted against it.
Assessor Dodge made one exception in
his list of untouchable banks. It was
that philanthropic institution owned and
operated by Wells, Fargo & Co. The
Wells-Fargo people, although' maintain
ing their headquarters in San Francisco,
are Incorporated under the laws of Colo
rado. They have branches in New York,
Utah and Portland. They have a sur
| plus of $6,712,000 on a capital of $500,000.
j but that vast amount is farmed out
I among their branches and cannot be
! taxed in this State, notwithstanding that
the company's chief place of business is
here, for the reason that under the law
such funds can only be taxed in the home
I of the corporationâ the place under the
laws of which it is incorporated.
""Wells-Fargo's president only laughed
at us," said Mr. Dodge, "and he told me
that he could come in here next year
and not pay a cent in taxes unless he
wanted to, and I guess he is pretty near
right. They simply unload their taxable
holdings among their branches and we
cannot touch them. All that we can as
sess them on here is real estate to the
tune of $2,172,947 and cash, which they
have notified us amounts to $496,099."
The Assessor said that there was just
one way of getung at the company and
that was by raising the assessment on
their banking franchise, which he has
already assessed at $10,000. and this prop
osition the board will consider.
In considering protests against this
year's assessments the board is for fhe
most part backing up Mr. Dodge's fig
ures, although few reductions have yet
been requested. Nearly all of yesterday
was given up to considering reductions
ranging from $50 to half as many thou
sand.
Two representatives of the Callagham
Estate Company came in to order a re
duction in a valuable triangular piece of
| property at West Mission and Potter
j streets. It was assessed last year at
$125,000; this year Mr. Dodge voluntarily
reduced it to $115,000. The estate wanted
it cut down to $57.000 and bandied not
many words in making its wants known.
Investigations developed that there was
every probability that the city owned the
| property and that the holders were little
I more than squatters. The assessment
was promptly raised to last year's figures
and the Callaghams retired disgruntled.
Property owners, or plausible rep
i resentatives, came to the front to
I swear glibly that their holdings were
not worth half the assessment, but
when asked as to their insurance it
developed that in most cases they car
ried policies for amounts far in excess
of the assessment. As insurance com
panies take risks only on about 60 per
cent of the actual valuation of the prop
erty, there was nothing left for the board
to do but deny. the petitions.
The Columbia Savings and Loan So
ciety sent in a representative w T ho was
loaded up with unkind things to be shot
at the Assessor. Dodge assessed the so
ciety's franchise at $2500, and the soci
ety's representative said that when he
i asked the Assessor upon what he had
based his calculation that official was
unable to tell him and referred him to
I "his expert." "If he based it upon the
number of our depositors." said he, "then
the assessment of the Hioernia Bank
should be raised a hundred or so times
what it is to be in proportion." The so
ciety's kick was well delivered, notwith
standing rather a severe struggle with
! modern English on the part of the ora
' tor. but it had no effect upon the board
I and the assessment remained at the origi
nal $2500.
The board will continue its considera
tion of property at 10 o'clock this morn
ing. _________Â» _

The Harbor Commissioners yesterday
decided to take no action on the request
of the local Board of Health for their
co-operation in refusing to allow vessels
! to dock unless they had a clean bill of
health. Two weeks ago a communication
was received relating to the subject,
which was referred to Attorney Budd for
his advice as to the powers of the Com
missioners in the matter, and he recom
mended that the communication be filed.
He argued that the Harbor Board could
not act except in a specific case whera
there was no doubt of the presence of
infectious diseases on the vessels and that
the Federal, State and municipal health
authorities were competent to deal with
the contingency.
Commissioner Kilburn presented the
names of two men for appointment as
collectors and Commissioners Herold and
Harney voted favorably. Eugene Sulli
van, former Assemblyman of the Forty

morning, thirty days from Hilo, with four
I passengers. She went to Long wharf,
i Oakland, to discharge her cargo.
Angus Beaton, a re-enlisted soldier
! waiting for assignment, was brought to
the Harbor Hospital yesterday to be
treated for an ugly wound on the right
side of the head. Beaton, who was per
fectly sober, claims that he was struck
on the head With a revolver by Officer
Davis, a new member of the police force,
I who was not in uniform, and without any
provocation. He says he was walking
I along near the Hotel Nymphia with a
friend, another soldier, whom Davis
! kicked and followed it up by striking
I Beaton. The latter was charged with
I disturbing the peace. Dr. Rice dressed
his wound.
Four minor cases were treated at the
Harbor Hospital. E. Moore, a teamster,
sustained a compound fracture of the
hand v.hile loading a boiler on Mission
i and East streets. A. Haven had a piece
of steel extracted from his right index

CRUEL TO HIS CHILDREN.
Otto Gross, a Tailor, Accused of Mis
treatment â Eureka Society to
Investigate.
Otto Gross, a tailor, with place of busi
ness at 1217 Polk street, will be prosecuted
by the Eureka Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Children if he does not con
tribute to the care of his children by hi 3
divorced wife. The latter brought Marie,
aged six, and Carl, aged eight, to the
rooms of the society yesterday and
showed Secretary Wadham their meager
appearance and wretched clothing. She
undressed both children to show the terri
ble condition of their bodies, due to the
ill care given them by their father, with
whom they have been living for the past
year. The mother stated she had been
divorced from Gross for over a year and
although she wa3 awarded the custody of
the children and $32 a month alimony, she
allowed Gross to have them, he promising
to feed, clothe and educate them prop
erly
That he did not carry out his part of the
contract was apparent in the condition of
the little ones. The little girl is suffering
from blood poisoning brought on by being
vaccinated, the dirt being allowed to lodge
in the little one's arm. Their mother
claims that Gross used to lock them up in
the back of his store and go downtown.
During his absence the children would lie
in bed and rob their hearts out for a pro
tector. The mother learned of their plight
and although she is poor, has taken them
in hand and will do her utmost to bring
them back to health. Secretary Wadham
s-tates he will visit the cruel parent to
day and if he refuses to contribute to the
support of the children he will swear to
a warrant and take him Into custody.

Whereabouts of the Embezzler

WHlard Baker, the fugitive embezzler
â¢who escaped officers at the ferry depot,
â¢was betrayed to the police by Dr. John
H. Porker, a d< ntlst, who has an office in
the Phelan building. Decker learned that
Baker was in hiding- in a room in the
Florence House at Ellis and Powell
streets and seeing a chance to make some
"easy money," as he expressed It, he con
cluded to inform the police. Going to the
office of Chief Lees he announced that he
the whereabouts of Baker, but de
manded $100 fur the Information. Lees re
ferred him to Inspector Morrlssey of the
Boston police, who was in the office anx-
Jously waiting for some news of Baker's
â whereabouts. Decker, after introducing
himself, told the inspector that he had
j Ive information that the much want
ed embezzler was In a certain lodging
â¢iiouse.
"It is to your interest to get him. I sup

ing dentist. "Come up with a hundred
dollars and I'll put you next."
Morrissey proceeded to question Decker
and after satisfying himself that he knew
the whereabouts of Baker he offered him
fcorty dollars to betray his hiding place.

After he van safely locked up Decker
was paid the amount agreed oa for be

It developed yesterday that Decker

through a conversation he overheard in
it Powell-street saloon. Baker, prior to
his arrest In Seattle, was one of the lead-
I in the Order of Eagles. Con
\ . . his innocence the members of
Seattle lodge made a vigorous fight
vent the Boston detectives, who had
j fter him, from taking him
back to the scene of his peculations. He
finally turned over to the Boston au

GEORGE GREEN IN
THE ROLE OF HERO
DANNY KEEDHAM had a narrow escape from drowning out at the
ocean beach, where he Is training George Green for his coming fight
with Charlie Goff, yesterday morning, and the fact that he is still In
the land of the living is due to Green's nerve, combined with rare
presence of mind and flrst-clasÃ. swimming ability. Green's training quarters
are located at the Seal Rock House, and each day before starting in to
work off his surplus fiit and harden his muscles for the coming battle it has
been his custom to take a stroll along the beach in company with his
trainer Yesterday morning, immediately after breakfast, the two athletes
started from the"ir training quarters tt>r the usual hour's lounging. They
walked out to the end of the Olympic Club pier, and while Needham pre
pared to catch a few fish Green sought a comfortable seat and was soon
engrossed in a perusal of Kipling's "Vampire."
Needham dropped the line overboard and waited patiently for a bltft. The
fish were shy, however, and after fifteen minutes the amateur fisherman
hauled in his line for a fresh cast. The splashing surf had soaked the string
ers of the pier, making the footing rather precarious, and as Needham made
his cast he stepped on the edge of the slippery structure and the next instant
was pitched headlong into the water. As he disappeared from view an in
voluntary co' escaped from his lips, and Green looked up just in time to
catch a glimpse of his vanishing form. Knowing Needham to be an expert
swimmer, Green was not greatly alarmed, thinking his trainer would experi
ence no difficulty in rescuing himself from his predicament. But there was
a big sea on, and when Needham came to the surface and struck out for the
pier a huge wave caught him and dashed him with considerable violence
against the side of the structure, rendering him unconscious.
Green saw his daager and as Needham sank beneath the waves he
stripped off his coat and plunged in after him. A moment later rescued
and rescuer came to the surface together some distance from the pier.
Needham was still unconscious and it required all Green's skill as a swim
mer and all his strength to keep himself and his helpless companion afloat.
After a heroic battle, with the waves and the outrunning tide, he succeeded
in reaching the pier -with his burden. Holding on to the pier with one hand
and keeping Needham afloat with the other. Green called lustily for help.
At that hour of the day there are very few people in the vicinity and his
cries were unanswered. Finally, -when almost exhausted by the strain of
"his exertions, (Jreen succeeded In restoring Needham to consciousness and a
moment later both were safe on the pier. They hurried to the Seal Rock
House, and Needham waa given a strong dose of whisky and put to bed.
Green was none the worse for his exciting experience, and after a good rub
down went for his usual spin along the beach.
A few hours' rest sufficed to put Needham on his feet and in the after
noon he was about as usual, declaring that he felt all right. This makes
the fourth escape from a watery grave for Needham within a year. Last
summer while on his trip to Alaska he was twice pulled out of the Yukon,
and again at Dutch Harbor he was rescued from drowning by a hair's
breadth Green's bravery and coolness under such trying circumstances
have doubled the admiration of his multitude of friends and added many
more to the list. He modestly disclaims being entitled to any particular
credit but the fact remains, and is generally recognized, ihat he performed
a feat that has been the making of more than one hero in the past, and
those who were informed of the occurrence yesterday were enthusiastic In
singing his praises.

extremely interesting, the speeches of the j
leaders in the movement to remove the
evil h.'iiifr full of strong and condemna
tory language.
In Introducing Father Redihan of the
Italian church, the chairman. Rev. W. S.
Urmy of the First Methodist Episcopal |
Church, said: "We are not here to offer j
Insults to the Supervisors, to charge any j
wrong-doing on the part of the Police â 
Commissioners or any public official, but j
we are here for the purpose of protesting i
in a gentlemanly and citizen-like maniit r
against this terrible evil which has^nrung
up in this fair section of the city."
That statement was the trend of the
meeting and every speaker who addressed I
the large audience had the thought con- j
stantly before him. Father Rudlhan de- !
nounced the evil and his words of protest
' against it found a responsive chord In the
hearts of his audience. Rev. Mardon D.
Wilson, an Episcopalian minister, fol
lowed with an equally strong speech
against the hotel. John J. Barrett, the
attorney for the leaders of the movement,
presented the legal aspects of the case.
His speech was full of fire and eloquence
and his audience were kept continuously
I applauding him. He stated that the
Twinkling Star Company got their incor
poration papers by misrepresentation and
in passing Bald "it Is our business to see
that the star dees not twinkle." He told
of the work of the committee before the
Board of Supervisors and of its partial
success. He said the Police Department
was with the residents of the North
Beach district to suppress the Nymphia
and said within the week the committee
would have the men who compose the
Nymphia Company arrested and brought
to the Police Courts for trial for conduct
ing a nuisance and on other legal grounds.
Rev. Dr. Slocum of the Green-street
Congregational Church followed, and
caused quite a little sensation when, in
speaking of the evil, he said the comm

unity must do the best it can for the
fallen women. "Go<i has made a hell for
such places." he paid, "but when it comes i
to Xnrth Beach we say to hell with it.
Not to hell with the women or the boys
who are enticed into flueh institutions,
but to hell with the temptation; to hell
with the evil itself."
Rev. Father T. Caraher, the prime
mover in the fight to close the Nymphia,
received an ovation when introduced. His
speech was full of power and greatly im
pressed his listeners. I, ike the preceding
speakers, he condemned the institution
and told how it should be suppressed. He
spoke of its dangers and suggested that to
impress, the Supervisors with their in
dignation the citizens of the district
should march to the City Hall, and If
they passed his house the sweetest music
to his ears would be, "We are coming,
Father Caraher, with at least two thou
sand strong." In conclusion, he said if
the Nymphia were closed the North End
district would be prosperous, morality
would flourish and It would be a virtuous,
respected community.
Speeches were also made by T. B.
O'Brien and A. Antonivich. The former
advocated the formation of a club and
[ made a motion that the Supervisors of the
| Second and Fourth wards be asked to de
! Clare the Nymphia a nuisance and to call
the Board of Health's attention to It
and have it closed as they would a pest
house. The motion was unanimously
carried. Mr. Antonivir.h's speech proved
a surprise to his listeners. Resolutions
were read and adopted denouncing the
hotel and instructing Attorney Barrett to
bring legal proceedings against the Nym
phia with a view to having It condemned
and also to have the directors of the
Twinkling Star Company arrested for
maintaining and conducting a house of
ill-fame.

L. W. Smith, superintendent of an
Alaska company, has been inquiring for
Miss Myrtle Sloan's address. Smith has
a touching note from the fickle damsel,
asking him to' write, but as she failed
to mention her street and number, he
has been obliged to seek police assistance
so that he may respond to her request.
This; is the second time within the past
few weeks that the millionaire superin
tendent has had to apply to the sleuths to
find the lady. â¢ .
A few months ago Myrtle rushed up
north to an old flame, George Barrett
who had just been released after a long
trial for the killing of Frank \\ ill lama
in Portland. Smith followed the faithless
damsel, found her in Seattle and Induced
her to return here with him.
Shortly after Myrtles return, Barrett
came to town, and also engaged apart
ments at 613 Bush street. Barrett s pres
ence developed in Miss Sloan a decided
business taste and she induced Smith to
purchase from John Ellis the lodging
house at 842 Post street, paying lor the
same $1000 and giving Smith a chattel
mortgage on the house as security for his

days and within the very week she pur
chased the house she sold it back to
Harris for $9uo and disappeared with Bar
rett and the coin.
When Smith discovered that he no
longer owned a lodging-house, he sought
the assistance of Captain Bohen, who de
tailed Detective George Grahnm on the
case. Graham did excellent work In the
matter and in short order located Barrett
and through him the woman. Smith met
Myrtle in the captain's oflicv. At Smith s
invitation, Myrtle went with him to din
ner to talk the maÂ«ter over. No definite
arrangement was made, and it was de
cided that Smith and the woman meet
again the next day at dinner and con
clude the business in hand.
The dinner grew cold and the lady came
not. The night grew late and still no
lady. Finally Smith returned to his rooms
at "the RUBS, where a note from Myrtle
awaited him. Humbly the writer apolo
gized for not appearing at the dinner, ex
plaining her absence by the fact that
sirice the detectives had ribught her out
at the lodging-house she had been the
observed of all observers and as she was
too modest to stand the rude stare of
strangers, she had left the town. In a
P. S. she added: -'Write soon"
Smith, it is rumored, is still willing to
forget and forgive.
When seen last evening Mr. Smith ad
mitted that he knew Miss Sloan. He said
she was a Portland girl and was a mem
ber of a well-known family in that city.
He said he was an unmarried man and
could go with any woman he. pleased.

he continued, "but it is my business. I
never lost any money through her. She

THE SEMI-COMMUTER IS TOO
SWIFT FOR C. P. HUNTINGTON
IN the language of the street, C. P.
Huntington is "a wise Indian."
Many times has he ridden the over
land trail and never yet has he
been detected by a lost quarter or
a single scent. For years he has har
ried the gentle savages of the Com
muter tribe resident in Alameda Coun
ty and ever and anon he has cinched
the suffering San Francisco public un
til it has come to be accepted as a
fact that the aged S. P. chief is the
cleverest manipulator of wampum
alive.

AN AMADOR
MAN FINDS HIS
LONG LOST SON
Duggan's Search Is
Ended.
MEETING AFTER MANY YEARS
EACH THOUGHT THE OTHEB.
LONG SINCE DEAD.
A Casual Remark Leads to the Meet
ing of "Billy George" and
the Author of His
Being.
A father and his son,, strancrers for
twenty-five years, each considering the
other dead, met a few evenings ago in
this city. The father is Theodore C. Dug
gan, one of the solid citizens of Plymoiun,
Amador County, and proprietor of two
stage lines running from that point. His
newly discovered son, who has long gone
by the name of Willi.tm George, is better
known to the one-time frequenters of the
old Baldwin billiard rooms as "Baldwin
George."
The meeting was arranged by James
Orndorf, one of the proprietors of the
Baldwin Annex, and took place last Fri
day in front of the bar of that resort.
"Billy," said Orndorf, presenting the
young man to an elderly gentleman, "this
is your long lost father. Mr. Duggan,
your son, Billy George!"
The reunited pair clasped hands, took
a good look at each other and shook.
"Have a drink." said the long-lost
father, releasing the hand of his new
found son long enough to reach into his
pocket for the price.
"Gimme a' little rye," said the young
man in response to the inquiry of the bar
tender as to the nature of his tipple.
"What's that?" exclaimed the father,
hastily placing on the bar the bottle from
which he had just poured a couple of stiff
lingers. "What's that!"
"A little rye," replied the young fellow.
Orndorf couid see from the glint in the
eye of the elder man that ho did not like
the Idea that his son was drinking whisky.
He saw th:u the happy reunion might be
disrupted if he did not act promptly.
"Don't you worry," he said to Duggan,
"because your son is drinking a little
whisky. I've known him for. fifteen years
and never saw the sign of liquor on him
yet. You two just go over there, sit down
and have a good talk. You'll find the boy
knows how to take care of himself.
Father and son Bat down at one of the
tables. They had not been talking two
minutes before Orndorf raw I'ug.ean ex
tend his arms and with tears streaming
from his eyes clasp the young man to
his breast. Time and again during the
half hour they sat there the father was
visibly affected, and when he arose to
accompany his son to meet an entirely
unsuspected daughter-in-law and two
grandchildren, he was as proud as Punch.
On the way to the home on Sixth street
he hecamo BO demonstrative in his af
fection for the newly discovered son that
a policeman was on the point of arrest
ing him. The bluecoat did stop them, but
satisfied with their explanation of the
reason for the Joy allowed them to pro
ceed on their way. Duggan met his son's
wife and hugged his children and spent
{ill of (Saturday with the family. return-
Ing to his home at Plymouth Sunday. He
would have taken the entire family with
him had not Mrs. George been too ill to
stand the journey.
The separation of the elder and younger
Duggan took place at Monterey more
than a quarter of a century ago, as the
result of the divorce of his father and
mother. Duggan left for parts unknown
to his former wife, and the boy, upon the
remarriage of his mother to a man named
George, took the surname of his step
father. The father went to Amador
County and there married a Miss Millie
Hayden, who is the mother of his two
other sons and two daughters. The boy,
as tha years passed, considered his father
dead. He wandered over the face of the
country, locating permanently In this city
some five years ago. From time to time
for that. although it is probable he
has existed for more than a year. As
near as can be ascertained, he is a
half-breed, a cross between the resi
dent of Oakland or Alameda who
daily crosses the ferry to this, city and
the San Francisco public. He looks
and acts and moves like other men,
but is not. He is a Frankenstein
growth of conditions established by
Huntington and has returned to de
stroy his master.
The method of the semi-commuter
is simple. In the lirst place, he lives
on this side of the bay, but has busi
ness that compels his presence in Oak
land or Alameda a dozen times a
month. Twelve round trips at 20 cents
figure up $2 40, which the semi-com
muter dislikes to drop in the S. P.
wampum belt. Wherefore, he has set
his cunning to work and now has mat
ters so planned that, while he makes
the necessary journeys across the fer
ries in the choo-choo canoes, he never
pays more than two-thirds of the
tribute.
First of all, the semi-commuter, in
tending to go to Oakland or Alameda,
buys a one-way red tinted ticket to
West Berkeley. That's 10 cents. As
he passes through the depot the gate
keeper punches two F's in the ticket,
â which is not taken up, as the fatuous
S. P. people imagine the wayfarer will
present it to the conductor on the

after the separation from his first wlfe^
Dugean made inquiries for his son. who
he thought might be groin* by the name
of George, but without success. On nis
last trip down to the city he sp , ok tJ2
Orndorf about a son he had been looKing
for. remarking casually that his name
might be Billy George.
"I'll bet I know him. exclaimed Orn
dorf. who became acquainted with the
young man while he was at the Baldwin.
Berkeley train. He does nothing of
the kind. His destination is Oakland
or Alameda, and at tho mole he boards
his train, on which tickets are never
taken up. By reason of this oversight
the semi-commuter has a punched
ticket in his pocket which Huntington
fondly imagines he can never use
again. The traveler knows better. He
is compelled of course to pay a 10-cent
fare hack to the city, but once on this
side his ticket is soon in as good shape
as ever to pass the gateman.
The semi-commuter takes any old
kind of clean paper and reduces It to
a pulp. This pulp is forced into the
F punch holes and pressed firmly in
place. When it is dried, a little red
Ink colors the supplied parts with a
color so similar to that of the remain
der of the ticket that, if his patching
is well done, it can be used over and
over again, a saving of 10 cents each
time.
It is estimated by one of these gen
tle half-breeds that there are no less
than a thousand of his kind in San
Francisco. Let Huntingto-n weep when
he casts up the figures. A thousand
semi-commuters paying $1 50 a month
when they should pay $2 40 is a clear
loss to him, at 90 cents for each, of
$900 a month.
Wow! But there'll be trouble for
somebody when Chief Who-Never-
Dropped-a-Quarter hears the news.
The two began comparing notes, the re
sult of which was that the room keeper
agreed to arrange the- meeting. Next
day, which was Friday, he approached
George.
â¢'Would you like to meet your father?"
he asked.
"Of course I would," replied the young
man, apparently not a bit surprised at
the question. The two sat down and com
pared notes, the meeting: took place on
schedule time and Theodore Dupgan of
Amador clasped to his breast his first
born. ___________
