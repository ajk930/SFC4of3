SOME OF THE AMERICAN ATHLETES
LONDON', July 22.â After nearly
three hours of such intense ex
citement as has seldom heen
known at an athletic meeting.
during which the final outcome
was always in doubt, representatives
of Oxford and Cambridge at last won
the coveted odd event; in the great In
ternational track and field sports at
Queen's Club this afternoon. As ha I
been predicted by nearly all experts,
the victory was secured by the win
ners of an odd event alone. The Amer
icans showed up to their best form in
all the events but one, and to-night
have nothing to complain of either in
regard to the manner in which the
games were conducted or In respect to
the effect which the English climate
had upon their condition. Burke, the
star performer of "the Harvard team.
â was far from being in shape and col
lapsed in the half-mile race, but with
this one exception the Harvard-Yale
men in every instance did all that
could have been expected of them.
From a spectacular standpoint the
meeting could hardly have been sur
passed. First the wearers of the dark
blue of Oxford and the light blue of
Cambridge and then the American uni
versity men were in the lead. When
the last event was ailed each side had
four â ins to its credit and the sensa
tional race which decided the day will
never be forgotten by those who were
present.
The contestants in the first events
were warmly applauded on entering the
grounds, followed as they were by the
judge.-, referees and timekeepers. The
jump was, made just in front of the pa
vilion and royal box, while simulta
neously the hammer throwing com
menced at the center of the grounds.
It soon became evident that the events
would tie, and wh< the English flag
rope for the jumpers and was followed
by the American success in the ham
mer throw, both sides had a chance to
give vent to their cheers.
The three mile was the deciding

seen that Workman of the Oxford -
Cambridge team would win and Eng
land thereby gain the odd event, there
, was a scene of wild enthusiasm, con
servative Englishmen and women rush
ing on the field to acclaim the victory.
A dense crowd instantly surrounded
; Workman, and it was with great dif
-1 ficulty that the stewards succeeded in
i making a way for him to the pavilion.
Here another scene of frantic excite
ment took place, members eft the Eng
lish team rushing forward and crying,
"Well run. Workman!" while on the
field the crowds cheered and waved
hats and handkerchiefs.' â  Workman
was led to the top balcony of the pa
vilion and therÂ§ bowed to the enthusi
astic thousands, while cries of "Hur
rah for Old England!" and the song
"For He Is a Good Fellow" rent the
; air.
Just behind the densest crowd, with
a few American and Yale and Harvard
flags marking the spot; the defeated
American runners '.were led to the;.,
room by their admirers. Both English
and American cheered the plucky los
ers, and amid a triumphant blaring of

crowds slowly dispersed.
The spell of hot weather was tem
prarily broken last night by a heavy fall
of rain, followed by a somewhat gloomy
morning, causing apprehension for the
interuniversity sports. At noon, however;
the sun was again shining and the heat
was tropical. This left London under a
hot mist, but dispelled the fears of rain.
The gates of the Queen's Club grounds
i were thrown open at 2:15 p. m. to take
crowds that were already surrounding the
entrances. The American and English
flags were flying from the center of the
i field, while the clubhouse and long rows
of stands which Inclosed the remaining
sides of the grounds were brilliant with
flags of all nations and the colors of
Yale ami Harvard, Oxford and Cambridge.
The announcement in the newspapers
that the Prince of Wales would not wear
a frock coat or top hat caused many to
follow the Prince's example and tne
grounds bore a purely holiday appeal
The rain had resulted in putting tne
track into excellent condition and the
microscopic care with which every super

EARTHQUAKE
SHOCKS IN
THE SOUTH
Strangely Coincident With
the Volcanic Eruption
in Hawaii.
SOME DAMAGE IS DONE
â â¦ â
Residents of Southern California
Cities Startled by Temblors of
Unusual Severity.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
There is, perhaps, a problem for !
the scientists in the remarkable co- |
incidence attending reported volcanic ;
disturbances of titanic magnitude on i
the island of Hawaii and the series j
of temblors that have shaken the I
whole California coast south of the
Tehachapi and as far inland as the ;
Colorado River during the past two |
days. Geologists are agreed that the I
California coast, geologically speak
ing, is a new country. The Hawaiian
Islands are, in the same sense, like
wise new. Whether there is a sub
terranean and fiery connection under
the sea between the coast and the
islands is a question of grave impor
tance, but one that is to the lay mind,
of course, unanswerable.
LOS ANGELES, July 22.â Los An- '
gelcs? was to-day startled by an
earthquake shock that has no i
equal recorded in years, and old
timers assert that they do not |
remember a similar occurrence. The j
I exact time of the visit of the temblor i
! is recorded by the big timepiece in the i
j local weather observatory in the top |
J story of the Wilcox building that j
', stopped the pendulum at 12 o'clock 37 j
I minutes and 28 seconds this afternoon. J
| The officials of the Weather Bureau say !
j that three shocks were experienced, but ;
â  that they followed in such rapid sue- j
I cession that the entire movement of |
j the earth's surface seemed as one mo- |
; tion. The duration was not timed, as |
; the excitement was too .great,- but a :
! comparison of watchfes !>>y a number of
persons agree upon fully ninety sec- i
i onds. The shock came from a few de- j
I grees east of north and extended in a j
j direction a few degrees west of south. j
. The greatest damage, so far report- .1
j was at the City Hall. The massive j
| building shook, trembled and vibrated.
J The building is the home of the public
j library and all the city departments.
i The occupants of these various divi
sions were thrown into consternation
| and rushed to the corridors.
The excitement was heightened when \
bricks, mortar and terra cotta were !
| hurled from a height of ISO feet to the |
i sidewalk The swaying of the build- j
i ing had loosened the fancy work sur- j
j rounding a part of the southern dor- \
, mer window, and it fell to the street. i
Judge J. Beardon, who had been stand- j
i ing by the pillars of the entrance of |
i the building, attempted to rush to a j
! place of safety and stepped upon the t
! pavement just as the falling debris hit j
j the flagstones. At th*' same moment
j the second shock, which seemed the i
j most intense, came, and it knocked
, the Judge down. At the moment it;
| seemed as if Beardon had been crushed j
}by the dismantled articles. Aside from
| being stunned, he was not injured.
The hook and ladder apparatus was
I called into service to remove the re-
I maining dangerous bricks, and later
! ropes were stretched across the side- ;
I walks and around the entrances to pre
| vent danger to pedestrians from any
| article that might be loosened and fall.
The next greatest damage is found
In the Wilcox building, where the
Weather Bureau is stationed. The
walls in the upper story are cracked
j for six feet, and all the plateglass win
| dows in the railroad offices are cracked.
The same is reported in the Hollen
beck Hotel and the Bradbury building.
I The residence portion of the city did
not escape. Damage to minor articles
is reported, while clocks stopped, pic
tures fell, and in some cases crockery
and dishes were smashed.
Two more shocks were felt this even
ingâone at 7:22 and the other at 7:50
o'clock. The atmosphere, which has
been very oppressive for several days.
is more congenial to-night, and the nu-
m erous temblors, which at first fright
ened the more timid, are now looked
upon as a matter of course, and a dis
cussion of the sensations experienced is
the topic of the hour. The damage was
confined to the displacement of a few
cornices, numerous cracked walls and
the breakage of some glassware.
In several localities the earthquake
was a benefit to the fruit-growers, the
fruit being shaken from the trees, thus
saving the expense of picking.

Another earthquake shock struck the
city this afternoon at 12:31. It was more
severe than the one yesterday. Clocks
stopped all over the city. The vibra
tion yesterday was east to west, but to
day it was north to south. There are
several cracks inside and outside the
: walls of the new Courthouse. A brick

The Masonic building was cracked
from the foundation to the roof. Sev
eral chimneys were shaken from build

Seriously Injured,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NASHVILLE, Term., July 22.â The I
Chesapeake and Nashville train
which left Gallatin this evening 1
for Scottsville, Ky., was wrecked ;
seventeen miles east of Gallatin. '
Two lives were lost, several persons re
ceived injuries of a serious nature, and
the damage done to railroad property
was large. The train consisted of six
cars, three of which contained freight. |
While the trestle between Bledsoe and
Westmoreland was being crossed a
portion of the structure gave way and
the train fell sixty feet to the ground.
The engine had passed over, when the
cars tumbled in a heap with a terrific
crash, carrying the engine with them.
There were quite a number of passen
gers on board the train, and most of *
them were injured.
As quickly as possible information of
the accident was sent to Gallatin and j
Nashville, and at 10:30 o'clock to-night
a special train conveying physicians
was sent to the scene, preceded by a
train from Gallatin with other doctors.
Mr. Bird, residence not known, said to
be the representative 'â¢:' a show, was
pinned in the ruins and burned to
death. Charles Speakman, a brake- 1
man, is missing and it is supposed that j
he perished. John M. Rogan, owner of j

THIS TIDAL WAVE
FOLLOWS EARTHQUAKE
ASHLAND, "Wis.. July 22.â tidal
wave raised the water of Chequamen
gon Bay and on the south shore of
Lake Superior three feet this forenoon.
It is the highest rise of water reported
for several years. It came nearly to
the top of some of the docks, flooded
roads and hacked up so high that sev
eral sawmills were obliged to shut
down. The water ran over many of
the lumber docks and into the boiler
rooms of mills. At 11 o'clock the water
began to recede and at 3 o'clock was
9 inches below normal. A strange thing
about it is the wind was far off shore.
Vessel captains report the same phe
nomenon on the Apostle Islands. The
water backed up in streams, flowing
into the bay, flooding and destroying
crops.
The simultaneous occurrence of the
earthquake in Los Angeles and the
tidal wave in Lake Superior are con
sidered to bear an important relation
to each other, as there hive been known
to be similar happenings in previous
earthquakes. The city of Lisbon, Por
tugal, was visited by an earthquake on
the morning of November 1, 1755, and
it was felt at the same time in cities
almost as far distant as is Lake Supe
rior from Los Angeles. A rumbling
sound which, precedes most earthquakes
was immediately followed by a great
shock, which threw down the principal
portion of the city. The sea retired,
leaving the bar dry. and returned in a
minute as a great wave or breaker
fifty feet in height. Sixty thousand
persons perished in six minutes.
The waves of the shock reached Scot
land, probably passing under it, causing
temporary changes in the waters of
Loch Lomond, which suddenly rose
more than two feet and then fell to
below their usual level. This is ex
actly similar to the tidal wave which
is reported from Lake Superior, and
which was undoubtedly the result of
the earthquake shock at Los Angeles.
There arc numerous other Instances on
record which substantiate the theory
that an earthquake will affect a large
body of water, even thousands of miles
away.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CLEVELAND. Ohio, July 22.â
party of strikers hidden in the
bushes of East Lakeview Ceme
tery fired on a westbound car at
10:30 to-night. Bullets hit the
car and went dangerously close to pas
sengers, but no one was hit.
Dynamite was placed on the Euclid
avenue tracks at Case avenue, but was
discovered in time. Two Broadway
cars, accompanied by forty cavalrymen,
were stopped by obstructions at Can
ton street. The soldiers drove the
crowd back, and started to remove the
obstructions. This action was the sig
nal for a general assault on the sol
diers. Stones of all sizes, bricks and
clubs were used, and the soldiers re
treated, leaving the non-union men and
police to battle with the mob.
The non-union men were armed, and
drawing their weapons made a bold
stand. The mob thought the show of
bravery was a bluff, and intoxicated
with the victory over the militia,
rushed upon the cars, only to be met
with a withering volley from the big
forty-fours of the conductors and mo
tormen.
The mob was disagreeably surprised,
and halted as another volley was fired,
and three members of the mob fell
wounded. At this some man among the
rioters, maddened by the sight of the
blood of his fallen fellow rioters, as
sumed the leadership and attempted to
rally his men to renew the attack.
That he had had military training was
evidenced by the manner In which he
issued his orders, but his training stood
him in no stead as his followers couldn't
understand him. He advanced toward
the cars, followed by about a hundred
men, but the motormen with their
faithful '-bulldogs," were still op guard
and poured another volley into the
* row*!, sending three more of them to
grass. This volley was followed by an
other and still another, each time
wounding on* or more men.)
Just at this juncture a squad of police
rushed up and with a yell charged upon
the crowd, bring their revolvers and
clubbing right and left with their
"heavy timber." The mob broke and
ran and the obstructions were removed.
An attempt to get the cars to the
barns was r -.ewed and they were final
ly taken to Petrie street, where a mob
was again encountered. By this time
a company of infantry had been sum
moned. With fixed bayonets they forced
the mob into side streets and formed
about the cars, but it was decided to
make no attempt to get them farther,
as it was seen that it would be simply
one long dr? out battle with the mob
which could only end in bloodshed. Sol
diers were detailed to guard the cars
just as they were.
The action of the militia in running
away from â¦'<â  mob may result in an
appeal to-morrow to tin President to
send regulars, on the ground that the
militia sympathizes with the mob and
is incompetent to establish and main
tain order.
'With the 5"! troops under arms to
back the police force, ami with more
troops in reserve if they are needed,
the authorities to-night believe they
have control of the strike situation.
The calling out of four companies of
infantry and a troop of cavalry to re
inforce the two battalions of Naval Re
serves, win* were ordered under arms
yesterday, was prompted by the out
breaks of anarchy last night and to
day. The companies of troops are on
guard to-night at the barns and power
plants of the company.
The press committee of the strikers
issued to-day an appee' to the public
w .ich, among other things, contains
the following: "We believe that force
can be applied in many instances, and
that it is absolutely essential in th-;
present case."
"The Government protects life and
property, but does not regard labor in
any light whatever. When great aggre
gations of capital defy law and wipe
out competition, thus minimizing the
demand for labor, they must be met by
an element strong enough to render
their organization futile."
A man named Fred Schneider was
shot through the arm by a policeman
to-night for throwing eggs at a car on
Cedai avenue. Schneider was ordered
to stop throwing eggs and he started to
run. The officer commanded him to
halt, and on his refusal to obey the
former fired. Schneider was arrested
' and his wound was dressed at a police
station.

OTTAWA, i int., July 22.â 1n tbe Com
mons to-day Sir Charles Tupper
brought up the question of the Alaskan
boundary. He said the United States,
ln refusing to submit to arbitration, j
well justified the decision Oreat Britain
and Canada had reached in declining ;
to allow the question to go before the i
Joint High Commission. He believed
the Government and the Commission
ers of the United States had lost con- |
fidence in their claims to the strip of j
disputed territory-
Sir Charles suggested that the Gov* [
ernment Introduce into this Parliament
two billsâ one providing for a railway
arm by Teslin Lake to Dawson, and the j
other providing for protection of Brit
ish and Canadian interests by enacting
that no license to mine in the Yukon
district shall be granted to any other I
than a British subject.
Premier Laurier, in reply, sympathiz- '
ed with much that Sir Charles Tupper
had said, He stated he had little hope I
now of a compromise, and was very'
sorry to say negotiations had not ad- |
vanced the position one iota from that :
of January last. The alternatives, he
gravely stated, were arbitration or war,
but nobody for one moment could seri
ously entertain the "pinion that the lat- j
ter would ever by any possibility arise,
unless the people of the United States, j
by their recent victories on the field of
battle, had become military mad and
bent upon a departure from well-estab
lished principles of republicanism.
Arbitration, he emphatically declar- i
ed, must come, nnd. although an agree
ment upon the terms of arbitration had
not yet been reached, he held that Can- '
adas wisest course was to exercise fur- |
ther patience and forbearance.
The propositions advanced by Sir
Charles Tupper, however, would be se- I
riously considered by the Government. I
WASHINGTON, July 22. â Senator
Fairbanks to-day announced that the
conference of the Joint High < !ommis- i
sion, which had been called for August
2. had been declared off. The Senator I
is in correspondence with Sir Wilfred
Laurier, and it is hoped a meeting can
be arranged for the earl;.- fall.

nine: smoothly and without Interruption.
The strikers are returning to work on this '
line, which practical] was the only one ;
affected in New York.
The most Important incident in Brook- :
lyn to-day was an attempt to cause an
explosion under a Seventh avenue car. A |
package containing two sticks of dyna- i
mite, with fuse attached, was found, but
it was a bungling effort and no damage
was done. ' -'â ; j
To-night the authorities were on the
gui vive for trouble, and policemen were
posted to the number of three to the block '
on Seventh avenue, the scene" of nearly
all the late disturbances. It was expected
that a meeting would be held to-night at
Clermont Rink. A squad of policemen
was posted at the hall to. prevent a gath
ering, but none of the strikers put in an !
appearance.
Bate to-night Chief Devery sent a large
body of mounted policemen to Brooklyn,
augmenting the mounted force there. He
also sent a barge number of the bicycle !
squad and detectives. Brooklyn is â  pa
trolled to-night by mounted men, and the :
detectives and police have been detailed
to watch the lines closely for dynamite, j
It was rumored that outrages would take
place. The police are taking every pre- I
caution to preserve order.
Judging from' the manner in which the
traffic was handled to-day, the officials of
the various lines, both in Manhattan and
Brooklyn, are confident of ending the
strike to-morrow.
SOUTHERN PACIFIC MAKES
AN OFFER TO SCALPERS
LOS ANGELES, July 22.â The railroads
are seeking to effect a compromise with
their foes, the scalpers. A story current
to-day was that the Southern Pacific hay
made overtures to take from the brokers
their stocks of National -Educational As
sociation tickets, which it would be con
tempt of Judge Shaw's department of tho
Superior Court to sell to the general pub
lic. The brokers seen to-day insisted, that
-such an offer had been made to them di
rectly by. Assistant General Passenger
Agent LuCe, arid that the 'offer had been
taken under advisement. The brokers ara
to meet on , Monday .and .decide ..what' i^
best for them to do.
Subordinate officials of the Santa Fe, it
is alleged, wired to headquarters at Chi
cago for instructions in the premises.
Some brokers contend that Judge Shaw's
injunction is not so serious as the decree
*.!' court appears "ii its face, for the rea
son that the writ, while prohibiting cer
tain individuals, who are named, from
dealing In National Educational Associa
tion tickets, cannot be made to apply to
any one else. "When this alleged fact was
called to tiie attention of the Santa Fe
law office the statement was character
ized as rubbish, for the reason that the
court's ruling prohibited not only the
several brokers mentioned by name from
handling tabooed tickets, but also any
and all of their employes.

PARIS, July 22.â Automobile tours
are becoming very popular. This
growth of touring seems likely to re
store prosperity to roadside inns that
railways appeared to have destroyed
forever. It may also revive the mori
bund art of cooking. Trips are now or
ganized to the most out-of-the-way
spots, the roads in this country being
so universally excellent that the only
thing to be considered is the place
where a good inn is located. An a.uto
mobilist here, speaking to me this
morning about the trip Mr. Davis is
making across the American continent,
said dryly: "In planning a tour here
we look out for a place for a good din
ner. In the United States you seem to
have to look out for places where you
can get your automobile repaired."
There has been quite a series of ac
cidents of late, not only to automobiles,
but also to automobilista There was
really a dramatic incident connected
with the accident that placed Mr. Wil
liams hors de combat in the great na
tional race. M. de Knyff was whizzing
past at breakneck speed trying to
catch up the quarter of an hour he was
then behind Marquis de Chasseloup-

Charron was leading him, when he
caught sight of the insensible chauffeur
lying in the road bleeding and generally
battered to pieces. It was a cruel di

The grounds were now completely filled
and presented a beautiful picture. The
great quadrangle was banked on - four
sides with tiers of seats, where gorgeous
summer toilettes were displayed, while
the sunshine was just strong enough to
emphasise the perfection of the scene. As
the stands filled up masses of blue and

white "V" center surrounding the Ameri

second place and drew even, but after
a few yards Dawson again passed him

All the men were greatly exhausted and

had to be almost carried to the pavilion.
Hunter won by thirty yards.
In the hurdles Fox led from the start to
finish and won by two and a half yards,
there being a half yard between Paget-

that Fox had equaled the British ama

In the half-mile run Streuben led for
the first lap, followed by Adams, Graham
and Burke ln the order mentioned. As

The automobile came into collision with

; As a general thing they are due to the

timid are afraid to cross the roads in
spite of all police regulations intended
to Impose a check upon reckless auto
mobilists. â 
The Temps a couple of nights ago de

spoiled child of fortune, but the time
had now come for the rigid enforce

led, but shortly afterward retired and
Smith took up the running just ahead of
Workman, with Clark and Palmer a
couple of yards behind and Foote torty

denly plunged head foremost on the track,
leaving Palmer to take up the contest
with Workman. Shortly after this Smith
fell in front of the pavilion. The race
was now left to Workman and Palmer.

that the two English universities contem
plate a return visit to America next year.
The dinner, which was given at the Ho

American Embassy, and John R. Carter,

SYRACUSE, N. V., July 22.â vex

terly impossible to proceed further this

open with us throughout."
While Mr. Jackson was talking Mr.
Wendell, who had charge of the American
team, came up and shook hands with Mr.
Jackson, saying:
"I heartily congratulate you. We could
not both win, and lam sure to-day's con
test will cement the friendship between
the universities, and that our athletes will
always be good friends."
It was learned that Burke has been
troubled with his stomach ever since the
arrival of the team in England, although
Mr. Wendell managed to keep the secret,
and the athlete was by no means himself
to-day. . . yf.-f
The Prince of Wales was especially de
lighted with the hurdle race, and sent a
message of congratulation to Fox, the
winner of the event.
Steward S. Brooks of Tale, who held
the Yale quarter-mile record, said at the
conclusion of the games: "The friends of
Yale and Harvard are satisfied that the
team lost the games on merits. Of course
Burkes failure was the crucial test. That
is where we went down. That was due to
causes that could not have been prevented
and we have no explanation or excuses to
offer. It was evident when the race was
half run that Burke was not in the form
we anticipated. We expected to have
lost the hurdle race and the dash rather
than the half-mile, but that only shows
how difficult it is to determine specific
results on the day before a race."
E. J. Wendell, the Harvard steward,
said: "No word of explanation or excuse
can come from any friend of the Ameri
can team. We met in the handsomest
spirit and lost fairly on our merits or
demerits. Certainly no one can say more
of English hospitality or sportsmanship,
and no friend of Yale or Harvard has a
word of complaint to utter."

CALL HEADQUARTERS, WEL
LINGTON HOTEL, WASHINGTON.
July 22. â Formal announcement of
Elihu Root's appointment as Secretary
of War was made to-day. He notified
the President of his acceptance early
this morning, and it is expected that he
| will come on to Washington to confer
I with him about the middle of next
week before he starts on his vacation.
It is also understood that he will be
here to formally relieve Secretary Alger j
on August 1, though it is probable !
that Assistant Secretary Meiklejohn j
will be left in charge of the War De- |
partment for a short time to enable
Mr. Root to close up his private affairs
before permanently taking hold here.
Mr. Root is personally known to most
of the members of the Cabinet, and his
appointment is heartily Indorsed by all
of them. The President's personal ac
quaintance with him. however, is lim
ited. He has always had a high regard
for his legal ability, however, and con
siders that he will be an acquisition to
the Cabinet from a social and political, j
as well as a legal standpoint.
Secretary Alger was one of the first
to congratulate Mr. Root upon his ap- |
pointment. He wrote him yesterday,
urging him to accept the appointment,
and wired him this afternoon congratu- j
lating him and thanking him for doing j
so. Alger had expected to make this
his last day at the War Department, as
Mr. Meiklejohn is expected to-night,
but it is understood that he has decided
to remain during the coming week in
order to close up a number, of impor
tant matters to which he desires to at
tach his signature before retiring to
private life. He is also at work upon a
statement in defense of his administra
tion of the War Department, which he
purposes giving to the public on the
day he becomes a private citizen.
Alger is uncertain as to his official
plans. I was told by one of hfs close !
personal friends to-day that it was by
no means certain that he would go Into
1 the coming Senatorial contest, and that
everything depended upon the state of
his health and the political situation
in Michigan during the coming fall.
Senator Burroughs of Michigan said
to-day: "I regret exceedingly the re
tirement of General Alger from the
Cabinet. I know of nothing in con
nection with his administration of the
War Department which would reflect
upon General Alger's integrity or pa
triotism. I think he has given to its
administration his best thoughts and
has conscientiously discharged his
duties, It must be, therefore, that he
retired for some personal reason of
which the public has no right to in
quire." .
Senator Burroughs spoke quite as en
thusiastically of Mr. Root's appoint
ment as he did regretfully of Mr. Al
ger's retirement. "Mr. Root is a splen
did constitutional lawyer," he said,
"and that is just the kind of a man
that the War Department needs at the
present time. We are nearing a point
when it will be necessary to establish
civil governments in the colonies to
.take the place of the military. The
change will involve many intricate

ROOT'S CAREER
AS AN ATTORNEY
NEW TORK, July 22.â Elihu Root is
one of the most successful corporation
lawyers in New York. Born in Clinton,
a small town in Oneida County, N. V.,
fifty-six years" ago, the son of Professor
Oren Root of Hamilton College, he sup
ported himself by tutoring while study
ing law in the New York University
Law School. He was admitted to the
bar in 1867 and has won for himself his
practice, which is said to bring him an
income of $50,000 a year. He first came
into prominence as one of the counsel
for William M. Tweed in 1873.
Richard Croker in the campaign last
fall made a savage attack upon Mr.
Root. Croker asserted that Root had
received from Tweed four lots on Mad
ison avenue "at a nominal considera
tion of $20,000," and from Thomas H.

BRONCHITIS and CONSUMPTION
SPEEDY RELIEF AND RADICAL CURE.
Speedy and radical cure of NASAL CATARRH, THROAT DISEASES,
BRONCHITIS AND AFFECTIONS OF THE LUNGS, and all complaints
that lead to CONSUMPTION.
By DR. ABORN, 554 Sutter St.
All who are suffering from Catarrh of the Headâ that loathsome disease,
so prolific of evil consequences â can be speedily and permanently cured if
they apply for treatment in season. There are thousands of cases of Throat
Disease, Bronchitis and Consumption due solely to Catarrh, to say nothing of
its less terrible consequences; Impaired Sense of Hearing, Smell, Taste and
Sight, the Loss of Hair and Teeth, the disgusting Effluvia of the Breath, the
Dingy Complexion. Dyspepsia, Neuralgia, etc. These are, in numberless
cases, caused solely by Catarrh of the Head. The disease afflicts thousands
who have never suspected its presence. Its symptoms are so diverse in dif-
ferent individuals as to often mislead the sufferer and his medical adviser.
The only safe and proper course is to have an examination from a physi-
cian competent to make a correct diagnosis, and to cure the evil when found
to exist. Dr. Aborn cures this loathsome disease after the ordinary modes of
treatment have failed, no matter how severe or aggravated the case may be or
of how long standing.
OVER 30 YEARS DEVOTED TO THE TREATMENT OF DISEASES OF
THE HEAD, THROAT AND LUNGS.
DR. ABORN'S TREATMENT
Gives instantaneous relief, builds up and revitalizes the whole constitution,
fortifies the system against colds and catarrhal affections and averts the ten-
dency or predisposition to consumption, and thereby prolongs life. Â'y

I Ingersoll, who was convicted with
j Tweed, one lot for "a nominal consid- j
' eration of $10,000." When Mr. Root
was asked if he had any reply to make
he said: "Not a word. I shall have
nothing to say now or at any other i
time. I shall ignore the whole mat- '
ter."
Mr. Root in 18S6, when the Senate was
! investigating the Broadway franchise ;
j steal, was counsel for C. F. Frothing
i ham and others who had invested in i
i the securities of the Broadway road.
: The franchise had been granted illegal- ;
| ly, and the question was whether it be
longed to the people or to the investors,
and it was suggested that bribery,
i fraud and general corruption had been :
I employed. The securities finally passed j
Into the hands of the Metropolitan
Traction Company, of which Mr. Root !
is chief counsel.
Among the noteworthy cases in which
Mr. Root has appeared was that
against the whisky trust in 1892, when
an attempt was made in Massachusetts
to have it declared illegal. Mr. Root '
appeared in defense of the trust.
Mr. Root has been an independent
Republican in local politics, and for
many years was one of the leaders in
the fight against the Piatt machine. He
is still attorney for the Traction Com- j
'â  pany, and its counsel have given Mr. *
' Vreeland opinions to the effect that the â 
i ten-hour law is not worth the paper
that it is written on, and pointing out
ways of evading it.
Politicians fear that Mr. Root will b<*
a heavy load for the administration to
carry next fall, as labor leaders declare
that the ten-hour law will be made an
i Issue in the campaign, and that Presi
dent McKinley must answer for his sec- \
retary.
Mr. Root was mentioned prominently
for Embassador to Great Britain when j
Joseph H. Choate was chosen. Mr. Root j
has never had anything to do with mili- .
tary affairs. He is reserved and digni
fied in his manner, and is an eloquent
and convincing speaker.
DELEGATES ADOPT THE
ARBITRATION SCHEMf
The Third Committee of the Interna
tional Peace Congress Con
cludes Its Labors.
THE HAGUE. July 22.â The third com- '
mittee of the International Peace Con- ;
ference held a session to-day under the j
presidency of Leon Bourgeois of the I
French delegation and adopted article 9 ;
as modified. The article now reads: "In
International disputes involving neither
country's honor nor essential interests,
arising from a divergence of opinion on!
points of fact, the signatory powers deem i
it advisable that parties which are unable \
to agree by diplomatic means shall Insti
tute, so far as circumstances will permit,
an official inquiry, whose duty It shall be â¢
to facilitate the solution of these disputes
by clearing up the questions of fact by
means of an impartial, conscientious ex
amination."
After adopting article 9 and passing the >
second reading of the five articles dealing
with commissions of inquiry, the commit
tee adopted, with slight verbal modifica
tions, articles 36 to .it* of the arbitration
scheme, and then adopted the scheme as
a whole, bringing the labors of the com
mittee to a successful conclusion.
Count Nigra, head of the Italian delega
tion, on behalf of his colleagues thanked ;
M. Bourgeois, who. Count Nigra said, had !
directed the discussions "with distinction, j
authority and impartiality," and in a con- ;
ciliatory spirit.
The committee will meet formally on
Tuesday next to read the minutes of its j
proceedings, and afterward a plenary
meeting of the conference will be held for
the final acceptance of the arbitration
scheme. - .; . .." ; . ~'~ : " .
The entire proceedings are expected to
be brought to an end by the latter part of '
next week. The technical delegates are

MORE TROUBLE FOR
UNION BANK OFFICIALS
Depositors Threaten to Institute Pro
ceedings on Criminal
Charges.
SAN JOSE, July 22.â There is a possi
bility that criminal proceedings will be
commenced against the Board of Di
rectors that was in charge of the Union
Pavings Bank when it failed. For
some time depositors have not been
pleased with the way the settlement
has been turning out. Although the
old officials assured them they would
receive dollar for dollar, it is said the
depositors will not get over 40 cents on
the dollar.
At a largely attended meeting of de
positors to-day a resolution was intro
duced authorizing the chairman to ap
point a committee of five to investigate
the advisability of commencing pro
ceedings against certain members >â¢!
the old board of officials. The resolu
tion carried unanimously, but there was
a hitch in the selecting of the commit
tee. This committee will be named at
a meeting to be held next Saturday.
The report of the expert on the bank's
books showed there was negligence for
years in the institution's bookkeeping
The report virtually states that the
| system of keeping books was so mixed
! that the expert was unable to tell
whether there had been any crooked
| ness on the part of officials or not. It
is said the depositors propose to inves
-1 tigate and they declare If there is any
wrong-doing the guilty ones will be
punished.
The management committee of the
depositors consists of H. A. ; Marckres,
Page Hollister, G. B. Hurlburt. F. Man
hire, G. McÃrier, J. D. Shafter. F. F.
Button, Luis Argues, E. T. Pettit. A. E.

It is from this committee that a sub
committee will be appointed to conduct
the investigation.
RURALES FOR CUBA

The United States to Organize a

MONTEREY, Mexico, July Lieuten
ant Powell Clayton Jr. of the Fifth United

where he is military attache on the staff
of Minister Powell Clayton. Lieutenant
Clayton is returning from "Washington,
where he presented to the War Depart

The United States War Department pro
poses to form a similar military organiza
tion for service in Cuba and Porto Rico,
and Lieutenant Clayton was instructed
about two months ago to make a study
of the Mexican rurales and submit a re
port on that organization to the War De
partment at the earliest possible moment.
Ramirez, chief of the rurales, rendered
Lieutenant Clayton much valuable assist
ance in his work. There are seven regiÂ»

PORTLAND. July 22.â Wells, Fargo
& Company's bank got a knock-down
blow in a decision rendered to-day by
Judge Alfred F. Sears Jr.. in the State
Circuit Court, in the case of George H.
Williams, Henry Welnhard. Cleveland
Rockwell and others versus the Com
mercial National Bank, which ls the
predecessor of Well, Fargo & Com
pany's bank in Portland.
Judge Sears' decision gives compen
sation to stockholders who were frozen
out two years ago by the Commercial
National Bank (practically Wells. Far
go & Company, who owned a controll
ing interest).
The suits were brought to recover
the value of stock sold because Of the
non-payment of an assessment of $50
per share. The assessment was levied
because the bank alleged that the stock
was impaired. The plaintiffs contended
that the assessment was levied con
trary to law. for the reason that it was
not first authorized at a shareholders'
meeting.
Th- bank, in Its answer, claimed the
plaintiffs were estopped for the reason
that at the meeting of the sharehold
ers, held January 12, 1897, a report was
made to the meeting that the directors
had made a levy on the stock, and no
protest was made by the stockholders;
that if a protest had been made, plain
tiff's stock would not have been sold.
It was also alleged that no claim was
filed by plaintiffs after the bank went
Into liquidation, and that the bank as
sets had been sold to Wells. Fargo &
Company for $250,000. and the money
distributed to the stockholders.
To these answers, the plaintiffs filed
a demurrer, and Judge Sears to
day sustained the demurrer, holding
that these answers are no defense, arid
that the bank is liable for the value of
the stock. The value will have to be
ascertained by a jury.
Between $60,000 and $70,000 of the
stock was confiscated by the bank at
the time mentioned, and though the
suit just decided does not include all
of the stockholders who lost their
stock, yet all who were zen out will
get the benefit of the decision.

prejudices and some times, as in
the case of the shooting of min
ers at Hazelton. refuses all ex
planation of and satisfaction for
the lynching.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLING
TON HOTEL. July .-.-With the assur
ances already informally made by the
State Department, coupled with expres
sions of regret, that the United States will
take proper action relative to the lynch
ing of the five Italians in Louisiana there
is no reason to tear any serious Interna
tional complications between this country
and Italy. So formal demand has been
made by the Italian Government, and
none will be made until all the facts are
known. If Investigation proves that the
men who were lynched; or an of them,
were Italian subjects Italy will undoubt
edly- make a .demand for indemnity.
Two conferences were held to-day be
tween Count Vinehi, Italian Charge d Af
faires; and Assistant Secretary of St^e
Hill. The Italian representative laid be
fore the State Department this dispatch
from the acting Italian Consul In New
Orleans: "Our Consular agent at \ icks
burg reports (ive lynched at Tallulah. ile
has gone there to investigate.' - Thiswas
he only official information Count V incni
had to'give the department, but he ex
pressed the hope on behalf of his Govern
ment that th*- United States would as
speedily as possible take steps to investi
gate the case and to punish the offenders.
The Count's manner was diplomatic and
.... - Later in the day he called to
inquire" for any further information tne
State Department hau received.
He was assured that prompt steps had
been taken to ascertain the facts, and
with this assurance the Count returned
to his offlce and cabled his Government
that proper reparation might be expected.
Count Vlnchi stated that he had no
doubt whatever that a satisfactory ad
justment â¢ would be secured. Dispatches
from New Orleans this afternon state
that some of the men had applied for nat
uralization papers. Copies of the court
record will be called for by the Depart
ment and if it is found that any of the
me-i are Italian subjects the department
will probably follow the same course as
in the Mafia'cases in New Orleans in 1S?0.
In theÂ«=e cases recommendations were

The Governor has named A. C.
Freeman, W. C. Van Fleet and George
J. Denis to be Code Commissioners,
and The Call begs to submit that one
more of its prophecies concerning
the action of Mr. Gage has come true.
LOS ANGELES. July Governor
Gage, who Is in this city, to-uay an
nounced the following appointments:
W. F. Fitzgerald to succeed the late
Judge W. H. Clark as Superior Judge of
Los Angeles County: A. C. Freeman. W.
C. Van Fleet and George J. Denis to be
Code Commissioners.
Governor Gage cast a bombshell among
â¢ the local lawyers by appointing cx
i Supreme Justice Fitzgerald. Although the
: Governor for ten days had his mind made
! up to appoint Fitzgerald there was
' scarcely a lawyer outside of the favored
i circle who was even so much as aware
: that Judge Fitzgerald's name had been
! suggested. The general opinion among
I the attorneys of this city was that the
! ermine was about to be thrust on the
' shoulders of Bradner W. Lee. Judge
'â â  Variel could have had the position, but
j his private practice is so large that he
i would not have been justified In accepting.
In fact. In the race there were twelve
i Ixis Angeles attorneys. It is conceded
here by Fitzgerald's friends that he has
: never been one of Governor Gage's friends
> and has been regarded as a bitter enemy
of Dan Burns since ISM. Some think that
I Gage wishes to show his gratitude to Fitz
gerald for having retired from the guber
j natorial nomination. A few others think
; that George Denis, Colonel Tom Lewis
i and R. B. Carpenter turned the trick for
; their friend Fitzgerald. But the lawyers
i of this city say that Gage would hardly
slap the local bar In the face to do a
: kindness to three friends. The rumored
: reason for the appointment that is abroad
j to-night, and one that finds more adher
! ents, is that it Is an attempt to placate
Harrison Gray Otis of the Times and

FERRYBOAT SAN RAFAEL
ALMOST IN COLLISION
Barely Escapes Crashing Into the
Leader While Backing Out of
Her Slip.
SAUSALITO, July 22 âA threatened col- i
i lision between the ferryboat San Rafael
and the Stockton river steamer Leader i
j this evening caused a panic among the
passengers. From the statements of per
â  sons aboard the San Rafael It would ap
| pear that a disaster was narrowly averted.
The San Rafael started to back out of !
her slip to make her regular 6 o'clock trip
! to Sausalito just as the Leader backed
! out of her slip, two piers to the north.
As the ferryboat is a '"single ender" she
has to swing around In a circle to head to
ward Alcatraz. The stern of the San Ra
fael in turning about was swung across
. the stern of the Leader, something which
: the passengers assert appeared to be un- I
expected by the captain of the Leader. i
1 For a half minute it looked as if the j
: Stockton boat was sure to back into the I
: San Rafael, and everybody aboard hustled ;
about in lively style to prepare tor the
worst. Full steam was put on the San
Rafael by Captain McKenzie, and the !
speedy little ferryboat shot past the !
stern "of the Leader with only a few feet
I to spare.

LEVEE CAVING AWAY.
Serious Situation at a Point on
Feather River.
MARYSVILLE. July 22.â The condition
of the levee along the Feather River at
the lower part of Nicolaus is becoming
serious. For several hundred feet the em
bankment and levee are gradually caving
into the stream. The current at that
place sets Into the bank with considerable
force and the lower strata of sand soon
washes out. allowing the top crust to
cave. This has been going on for some
time. An effort has been made to get the
Government engineers to take hold of the
matter but with little success.
In the Interests of navigation and the
preservation of the river, the Government
or State should repair the damage done
and put the bank In good condition. Sev
eral plans have been considered, such as
piling the bank, building the levee around
the place or putting ln wing dams to turn
the current in another direction; but any
of these would be too costly for the local
levee district to be asked to- defray the ex
pense and it is earnestly hoped substan
tial aid can be obtained to repair the dam
i age done the bank and levee before the
i winter season.
STRUCK BY LIGHTNING.
Two Men Narrowly Escape Death in
Modoc County.
MARYSVILLE. July 22.â J. H. Brock
man, a cattle buyer, who recently re
turned from a trip to Modoc County, gives
an account of a singular experience his
party had in a thunderstorm last week.
Four of the men had gone out after a
band of sheep, leaving at the camp one of
the drivers and another man.
A thundershower came up. The camp
was under a large tree, and the two men
were seated near the trunk, when light
ning struck lt. burning the trunk and
scattering the bark in all directions. A
wool sack which covered some mutton was
hanging In the tree and was burned, with
about twenty feet of rope. Leaning
against the tree was a spade and the
handle was shattered and broken In many
pieces A do_r Ivlng near the spade was
instantly killed. The two men were
stunned for several moments, and they
consider themselves lucky to have es
caped with their lives.

Recommendation Recently Made by

Special Dispatch to The Call.
MANILA. July 19, via Hongkong, July
22.â Chief Surgeon Woodhull considers
that the increase in the military force in
the Philippine Islands will necessitate
the employment of forty additional sur
geons. Surgeon "Woodhull's recommenda
tion to that effect has been disapproved
by Major General E. S. Otis, command
ing the United States forces here.
There are nearly 3000 soldiers in the hos

GERMAN COMMENT
ON THE CAMPAIGN
BERLIN, July 22.â The Philippine cam
paign has been alluded to frequently this
week in the newspapers. The Kreuz Zeit
ung says the Americans are making no
progress in spite of exertion.
The Boersen Courier, referring to ef
forts made in Washington to raise new
troops, says: "The United States is ap
parently developing into a military state,
after the example of European countries."
Newspapers here print a letter from a
German at Manila giving the following
account of things there:
"American officers hold brilliant recep
tions in private houses and in the Casino
at Malate, to which they invite prominent
Filipinos. The last week in June there
was a great festival and which ended with
a ball and fireworks. Four-fifths of the
guests were Filipinos. All the ladies were
invited to appear in picturesque native
costumes. But while the American civil
officials are leading the Filipinos into
fraternizing and feteing the two armies
are constantly fighting. Everywhere the
Filipinos have strong corps pushed close
upon the American lines, and wherever a
patrol leaves the main body it finds Itselt
in the presence of the enemy and threat
ened with being surrounded.
"The Americans take revenge by having
ships fire upon Filipinos wherever a few
show themselves in order to bathe. How
helpless are the Americans outside of
Manila is shown by the capture of two of
ficials of the hospital ship Relief. This
vessel took a short sail under the protec
tion of the cannon of the warships oft
Paranaque. and was suddenly surrounded
by native boats, and the natives captured
them." _______^____â

LONDON, July 22.â The close of . the
most dreary sessions of Parliament with
in the memory of men now living is in
sight. The members of the House of Com
mons expect to flit about August 1, in time
to reach the \ moors for the opening of |
grouse shooting, which begins August 21. j
The Government has met many rebuffs '
in both houses of Parliament, and the
reduced majorities with which they have i
carried some pet measures have consti
tuted mora] victories for the opposition. !
The Conservative leaders, in short, have
displayed their usual vaceilation, inde- i
cision and feebleness in resisting the de
mands of the "classes against me
masses." Lobbying has been more preva
lent than ever before. Unfortunately for ,
the success of tiie Liberal party the l* ad- j
ers on that side have shown little aptitude j
to score off the numerous shortcomings of j
the Tories or to profit by the rebellious
ness that several Government measures
awakened in the ranks of Lord Salisbury's
adherents. in short, the Liberals have
shown themselves rather demagogical op- ;
posers than initiators of a new line of
policy. Otherwise they might more than \
once have forced a dissolution of Parlia
ment and appealed to the country with j
success.
The determination of the admiralty to j
Improve the gunnery of the navy has
come none too soon in the opinion of ex- J
perts, and tliere is general satisfaction
that the authorities have decided to foi
low the example of the United States
navy and double the allowance of ammu- â¢
nition for firing practice. The recent "un- â 
pleasantness" between the United States
and Spain, demonstrating the admirable j
gunnery of the American navy, coupled
with official returns just Issued and show
ing tiiat the best British gunners failed to
hit the target seventy out of every one i

miralty to the necessity of mending mat- j

Britain sends a fleet to Intercept that of

lies upon numerous torpedo boats issuing

relies upon torpedo boat destroyers to
cope with the torpedo boats and give free
play to the seagoing ships. The real test

What President Kruger declined to
yield to the petitions of the I Itlanders
and the arguments of the British High
Commissioner of South Africa Sir Alfred
MllnerJ lie seems inclined to yield to the
more forcible hints of the war Office
comprised in unobtrusive but obvious mil- :
itari preparations. The sudden change of
lront by the Volksraad In adopting the
seven-year franchise proposition on last ,
Tuesday is a forcible demonstration of me
claim that President Kruger can and does
yield when the proper pressure Is ap
plied, but not otherwise. As Mr. Cham- ;
berlain said in the course of bis speech
in the House of Commons on Thursday
regarding the modification of the franchise
law in tne Transvaal the concessions do
not ond the difficulties, but merely offer i
a basis for a pacific settlement, and for
mer experiences with the Transvaal have
taught the Government that it is mad- â 
visable In any way to relax pressure un
til the contract is concluded. The mili
tary preparations, therefore, have been in
no way relaxed.
Th*-r*- is a general suspicion in city cir- ;
cles that the Curzons are in some way
mixed up with the arrangement under
which. Clinton I â  iwkins, financial member â â 
of the Indian Council, is to become a
member of the firm of J. P. Morgan &
Co.. and American capital will hereafter
find a larger field for investment in India.
Some find confirmation of tliis idea in the j
strenuous support being given by the j
Government of India to the employment
of electricity as a motive power in the |
great factories for military requisites
which it is intended to build at Jubbul- i
pore. Officials are said to want Ameri- !
cans to duplicate the works at Niagara
Falls, claiming that the falls of the Ner
budda and Godavery are fully equal t*. j
those of Mi agar a.
Englishmen are also greatly excited
over the published announcement that
the New York Airbrake Company, fol- j
lowing the example of the Westinghouse
Company, intends to establish factories j
in Europe.
Following the lead of their more enter- .
prising brethren in the I'nited States,
the medical world of Europe is eagerly

Berlin and Paris of American success In

THE LAST DAY AT
CAMP FALLON
Young Cadets Vie With One
Another in Supplying
Merriment.
LAST-DAY SCENES AT THE CADETS' CAMP.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, CAMP
FALLON, SANTA CRUZ, July 22. -
The last night in camp was a mem
orable one to the cadets and the
large number of visitors who thronged
Its confines. The young soldiers vied
with one another In decorating the streets
and supplying entertainment for the vis
itors. Companies H. R and M used hunt
ing and Chinese lanterns to beautify
"Bolo" avenue. The company sat before
Captain Hopper's decorated tent and
drew crowds by singing and merriment.
Company D decorated "Cullen" boulevard
in pretty style and supplied an excellent
programme. The visitors were enter
tained with a grand concert by the band
under the direction of F. E. Neuberger.
To-night being the last in cam] the
boys did all kinds of "horse play." Early
in the day the faces of sleeping mpan
i ions were blackened clothes stuffed or
! hidden and Innumerable tricks played.
: Previous to the arrival of visitors Com
pany E held a wake over a stuffed man,
"Kelly by name, who died of eating too
much pie." At midnight the tents were
thrown down, the sleepers dumped from
their couches and enough wickedness
done to make sleep for the night impos
sible.
The "Owls" returned the courtesies of
Santa Cruz ladies by entertaining them
at headquarters during the evening.
Colonel Sullivan is a very "sore" man.
He paid express charges on a beautiful
gold brick sent to him from San Fran
cisco. He has a clew to the sender and
vows vengeance.
The cadets are not anxious to go home.
They claim their fun is iusl beginning
and "are willing to stay another week.
Notwithstanding th 'that the cadets
who participated In last night's minstrel
show for the benefit of Father McNamee's
schools had not had a rehearsal, the per
formance was a creditable one. The pro
gramme proved excellent, and was greatly
appreciated bj the large audience which
filled the opera-house. Musician Steve
Douglass and Sergeant "Pot" Mahonej
scored the hits of the show by their sing
ing and "horseplay." F. E. Neuberger,
j the leader of the band, ted in the capa
city of musical director, and Musician Ar
' tigues presided at the piano. Some of the
jokes sprung on the good-humored audi
i ence were a trifle old. but their telling
aroused great mirth. The cakewalk of J.
H Saunders and Sergeant Robert Gleason
I was an artistic success. Both boys were
i graceful and showed familiarity with all
; the pose's and steps used by professional
; cakewalkers.
Dr Warren, "which I have sent to I
America for experimental purposes. The
greater liberality of the vivisection laws ;
at home has given an advantage to the
I'nited States in the preparation of
serums, so that scientists like Professor
Erllch of Berlin have imagined that
Americans have discovered means of con
centrating serums that are unknown In
Europe The consensus of scientific opin
ion ln Europe confirms the belief that the
bubonic plague, cholera and yellow fever
can be controlled by the serum treat

The reception given by the Duke and

THE SAIN FBA3SCISCO CALL, SUNDAY. JULY 23, 1899.
Father McNamee expressed his aprpeci- j
ation to the cadets for their assistance in j
the cause of charity, complimented them
on their splendid showing, and expressed
a wish that they would return next year
to Santa Cruz. Colonel Sullivan responded
with appropriate remarks.
While the officers of tit" regiment were
at the theater the cadets held high car
nival in camp. The officer of the guard
and his assistants seemed powerless to
stop their fun. which was fast and furi
ous. Companies H. R and M held a grand
powwow on 8010 avenue, which is a fancy
name for their street. A large bonfire was
mad** in the street, and the members of
the three companies surrounded the
camplire. sang songs; joked and had a
glorious time. Father Dempsey, Lieuten
ant Gonzales, Captain Powers, Captain
Curley and Captain Mclntyre were guests
at the affair. Shortly after taps was
blown refreshments were served. They
consisted of good things brought away
from the feast given by Mayor Phelan to
the. regiment In the afternoon. After these
had been consumed the usual tent-wreck
ing performance was given. In their wan
derings they found Lieutenant Charley
Flynn asleep in his tent. Four of the
"Bolos" grabbed the cot and gently car
ried him down to the campflre, and after
blackening his face with charred sticks
they awakened th" officer with their tin
ea r'thlv veiling. The arrival of Colonel
Sullivan put a stop to the" merry-making,
ami the "Bolos" retreated to their wig
wams.
Dr. Sullivan essayed to guide a party of
ladies and officers "to town last night, and
managed to get lost. When they arrived
on the main street of the town it was
nearly daylight.
An enioyable evening was spent at tbe
residence of the Misses House last night
by Captain Joseph Wesplear, Lieutenant
J." E. Hackenbrtck. Lieutenant T. J. Cur
tin Sergeant J. Dougherty. R. Gleason. A.
Rossi. Private Saunders and Corporal A.

J. H. Cain, a commission merchant of
San Francisco, accompanied by his wife,
visited the quarters of Company D yester
day. Mr. Cain presented the company
with a number of boxes of oranges and
lemons.
The last night in camp was a joyous one.
Every man in the regiment remained
within the lines and helped entertain the
many visitors who were present. At head
quarters the band played selections, and in
the company street the cadets sat out
side their tents and sang and entertained
generally.
Mrs. John F. Merrill, president of the
Red Cross Society of San Francisco, her

that the traps could not be raised, A
drunken Japanese threw a Chinese
from his bunk Into the street. Chinese
rushed to the aid of their countryman,
while the Japanese rapidly received re
inforcements.
The battle raged ln the middlle of
the street, where rocks, slabs and slab
piles were handy. When the police final
ly separated them it was necessary to
send two chines., to the hospital and
a number of others looked as though
they should be there.
At the opening of the cannery this
morning hostilities broke out anew. In
th* melee one Chinese was struck over
the head with a bar of solder and
knock". l insensible. The fight was
growing fast and furious when the po
lice, foreman and other white over
seers heated long iron bars and suc
ceeded in getting the belligerents apart.
At noon all of the Japanese em
| ployed were discharged, with the hope
[ that peace would be restored. At 2:20
; o'clock a force of Chinese issued from
' the cannery, armed with axes and
I knives, and went on a run to their
i bunk houses, claiming that they be
lieved the Japanese were trying to burn
their dwellings. The rumor was un
founded, however, and the police per
i suaded them to go back to work.
The police are guarding both night
and day the neighborhood in which the
bunk houses are situated.

The Belief Growing That the Girl's
Body Was Concealed in the
Park After She Died From
Natural Causes.
SrÂ°-~ial Dispatch to The Call.
PORTLAND, Or., July 22.â The most
remarkable feature of Clara Fitch's
murder is that neither the police nor
the girl's relatives can advance a rea
sonable motive for the crime. There
were no new developments to-day.
Frank McDaniel has been closely con
fined, and as he has not engaged a
lawyer no one is permitted to see him.
The belief is growing that the girl
died a natural death while she and Mc-
Daniel were in the park together, and
that the young man, fearing her fath
er's anger and vengeance, concealed
the body as best he could under the
brush and ferns. The marks of violence
are faint, and it is possible the slight
bruises were made in concealing the
body after death.
The Coroner's investigation, which
was to have been resumed this after
noon, went over till Monday, owing to
the absence of witnesses.
MONTENEGRINS TO GREET
THEIR FUTURE QUEEN
Great Preparations Being Made for
the Marriage of Princess Jut
ta to Prince Danilo.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1899, by James Gor
don' Bennett.
BERLIN, July 22.â 1t is seldom that
a German princess marries outside of
her country and for this reason the
coming wedding of Princess Jutta of J
Mecklenburg-Strelitz to Prince Danilo
of Montenegro is attracting an unsual
amount of attention. Her Highness
has already left for her future king- j
dom, going first to the little town of j
Antivari, where her conversion to the
Greek church will take place to-mor
row. This, it may be said in passing.
Is to the great indignation of the Kai
ser, who, as temporal head of the Luth
eran church, is most indignant at such
apostasy, When she changes her re
: ligion the bride also alters her name
i from Jutta to Miletca.
The marriage is a very romantic one.
As the little Montenegrin principality
is very badly off for means of commu
nication the Princess will be required to
ride on horseback from Antivari via
Virpasar and Rjecka to Cettinje. The
other royal .guests will, however, take
a more convenient route via Cattaro.
Ail the male population of Montenegro,
armed to the teeth, have poured into
the capital to greet the German Prin
cess and their future Queen.
The Princess' witnesses at the mar
riage ceremony, which will be cele
brated Wednesday, will be the Prince
of Naples and Grand Duke Constan
tinovitch of Russia.

SINCERITY MAY
SAVE INGERSOLL
Such the Opinion of
Some Ministers.
â â¢ â -
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, July 2.'. Much interest
is aroused by the comment of ministers
on the death of Colonel Ingersoll.
Rev. Dr. D. J. Stafford of St. Pat
rick's Church. Washington, said: "Poor
Boh Ingersoll; I hope he was honest.
If he was, there is a chance for him."
Clergymen were asked their opinion
of this view of an agnostic's future, and
some of their replies follow:
Rev. George H. Hepworth said: "The
question you ask me is something like
this: Admitting that Colonel Ingersoll
! was sincere, and admitting also that
he was in the wrong, can he be saved?
How can any sane man answer that
question except in the affirmative? We
judge a man by his actions, which very
frequently misrepresent the man's
heart. Our judgment therefore is
faulty and often unjust. God judges
a man by the standard of motive, and
therefore a great many people whom
we would damn because we don't know
enough to save them will sit in a high
place in the hereafter. For that mat
ter, when we get to heaven we shall
find some there whom we never ex
pected to see, and we shall not find
others whom we may look for."
Rev. Sidney Herbert Cox, pastor of
Lee Avenue Congregational Church,
Brooklyn, said: "An honest man has a
right to salvation."
Rev. Dr. Henry Abrams, pastor of St.
Agnews Roman Catholic Church, con
sidered Ingersoll a fakir who traded in
his infidelity to make money. "Mr. In
gersoll was an ignorant man," he said.
"He had wit and talent, but he spoke
of subjects which he had not studied
and ridiculed things which he knew
only by half."
Rev. Daniel McDermott of St. Mary's
Catholic Church, Philadelphia, said:
"Our Lord said of those who crucified
him, they should be forgiven, for they
knew not what they did. The first
thing I would have to excuse ingersoll
for would be his sins against truth.
God condemns no man who supposes
he is in the right, nor do we hold a
child guilty for the sins of innocent
ignorance."
Rev. William B. Bodine, rector of the
Protestant Episcopal Church of the
Savior, said: "1 do not know why an
agnostic, if honest in his beliefs, should
not enter the kingdom of heaven."
Rev. Charles W. Bickley of the Mari
ners' Methodist Episcopal Bethel said:
"I cannot believe that an all merciful
Father will punish his erring children
when they unknowingly disregard his
divinity."
Rev. Dr. William Lyons of the First
Unitarian Church of Brookline. Mass.,
said: "We must all come to the truth,
and Ingersoll, no matter what his be
lief, has come to the truth in the life
hereafter."
Rev. A. A. Berle, Congregationalist,
Boston, said: "Ingersoll was a brave,
chivalrous, high-hearted man. resolute
in his championship of what he be
lieved to be true, infinitely more to be
respected than certain clerical infidels
who discredit both the gospel and Bible
by covert insinuations. Peace to his
ashes."
* ASBURY PARK, N. J. July 22.â 1n

saved if sincere?" Bishop James N.

, Church, St. Louis, who is spending the

BOSTON, July 22. Rev. Herbert J.
White of Bethany Baptist Church said:
"Sincerity is not enough. Ingersnll
will not be saved if the Bible is true."
Rev. George L. Perm of Every Day ,
Church said: "Ingersoll will be saved,
of course, for God loves honest men."
Rev. Herrick Johnson, professor in

Ingersoll. A man may go. to hell with
a clear conscience."
Working to Free a Robber.
AUSTIN. Tex., July 22.â An effort to ob
tain the release of Charles A. Beeler, in
jail at San Antonio, Tex., under sentence
of five years' imprisonment in the peni
tentiary for the robbery of the Wells-
Fargo express of $50,000 cash, was made
here to-night in the form of an applica
tion for a writ of habeas corpus, which
was presented to Judge J. T. Henderson
of the Court of Criminal Appeals by Bee
ler's attorney. The ground is that the
court records at San Antonio show that 1
mistake was made in the name 01" the
prisoner, that of J. T. Evans instead of
Charles A. Beeler being contained in the
record. Judge Henderson took the appli
cation under advisement.

of wedded couples, otherwise happy, fall

and makes them strong, healthy, vigorous,
virile and elastic. It allays inflammation,
heals ulceration, soothes pain and tones
the shattered nerves. It fits for wifehood
and motherhood. It quickens and vitalizes
the distinctly feminine organism. It ban-
ishes the maladies of the expectant months
and makes baby's introduction to the world
easy md almost painless. It insure? the

HEALDSBURG, July There was
a large gathering of the vineyardists
of this section in Healdsburg to-day to
consider Mr. Crocker's proposition to
take control of the wine output. Hon.
W. W. Moreland was chosen chairman
of the meeting and F. W. Cooke secre
tary. A. Sbarboro, secretary of the
Italian-Swiss Colony, was the principal
speaker. He strongly favored the ac
ceptance of Mr. Crocker's offer, not
only as a grape grower but as a wine
maker He believed Mr. Crocker had
not only the financial ability to carry
out his plans, but the integrity as well.
The grape growers of the State have
had practically seven years of famine,
and in accepting Mr. Crocker's offer
they would be assured of seven years
of plenty. The price, $14 a ton, would
pay them 12 per cent on the capital in

above all expense incurred in producing
their grapes. Mr. Sbarboro read a copy
of the following letter, which had been
sent to Mr. Crocker by the Italian-

" ITALIAN-SWISS COLONY.
A. SBARBORO, Secretary.
Other speakers were J. R. Miller, PI.
C. Hodges, Mr. Dewey, P. C. Rossi, I.
Fredson and A. McPeak.
A standing vote was taken on Mr.
Crocker's proposition and it was unan
imously accepted. Most of the growers
present had already sent to Mr. Crocker
notice of acceptance, but the signers
at the meeting represented 1000 tons.
SANTA ROSA, July 22.â meeting
of grape growers of this section held at
Horticultural Hall this afternoon dis
cussed Henry J. Crocker's recent offer
to purchase the grape crop upon terms
with which the public already is fami
liar. , a
The gathering was well attended, and
as a result of the consideration and dis
cussion a resolution was adopted de- |
claring it to be the sense of the- meet
ing that Mr. Crocker's offer be in
dorsed and recommended to the grape
men of Sonoma County. The resolu
tion in addition asked for an early in
spection of the contract.
The meeting was called to order at
2 o'clock. Jonathan Roberts, president
of the horticultural society, acted as
chairman, and Herbert Slater was
elected secretary. After stating the ob
jects of the meeting the chairman read
an article from the pen of John Bailiff,
a. Mount Olivet grower. The article
strongly favored the acceptance of the
Crock proposition and brought on
considerable discussion. Among those
taking part were Victor Piezzsi, Wil
liam Ross, A. Frel. John Bailiff and F.
Balniina of St. Helena.
The general sentiment was that the
proposition was a good one, but sev
eral speakers devoted considerable en
ergy to making it clear that their ac
ceptance would depend entirely upon
the fairness of the contract with which
they were presented. Among those
taking this position were R. J. Suther
land of Bennett Valley, Mr. Litchfield j
of Sebastopol, George Dohn and L. E.
Ricksecker of this city. The resolution
was draw n by Victor Piezzsi.
From interviews with grape men of
this vicinity there seems to he small
doubt that Mr. Crocker's offer will be
generally accepted if the contract he
presents is a fair one and binds Mr.
Crocker as well as the grower.
EL AG INCIDENT AT HONOLULU.
Action of the United States Approved
by Germans.
BERLIN, July 22.â flag incident at
Honolulu on July 4 has been very sensi
bly treated by the German _?ress. The
swift punishment of the offender is re
garded as proof of the correct attitude
of the United States toward Germany.
There was not a single Jarring note in
the press comment. Most of the papers
did not regard the incident as of such
importance to notice.

' Announcement That Chief Justice
Chambers Is to Leave Samoa
Received With Satisfaction
at Berlin.
Copyrighted, ISD9, by the Associated Press.
BERLIN, July 22. The week has been
almost devoid of political events. The
newspapers have been threshing over the
old straw of the canal, anti-strike and
| other bills, but without saying anything
j new. The hill for protecting the rights of
! authors, composers and artists was pub-
I lished this week. It is a tentative meas
j ure, put out for the purpose of drawing
! criticism, which will hp taken into ac
! count when the bill is presented in the
| Reichstag. Several points have already
called forth strong criticism, such as the
I provision to punish the publication of pri-
I vate letters without th* authority of the
j writers. The printing of unpublished pub-
I lie document* is also made punishable.
! Many of the newspapers assert that these
I provisions are aimed at the Vorwaerts,
i which has shown surprising ability in the
| direction of securing public documents and
1 letters
Berlin is in the midst of a vacation
j season. The exodus to the mountains and
I seaside continues in the usual proportions,
I those going by night train.- to Switzerland
finding it almost impossible to secure
sleeping berths.
The week has been unusualy hot and
humid. Heavy rain and hail storms have
occurred in various parts of the country,
â  inflicting much damage to the crops. Many
' people have been killed by lightning, two
| such cases having occurred in' Berlin. A
j number were also injured in Berlin. The
river Havel at Pottsburg has been filled
j to its banks for several days, and thou
\ sands of fish were killed by lightning.
; Floods are reported in the Spreewald, and
i in the lowlands of the Vistula the hay
! crop has been ruined for the second time
I this season. In Wurtemburg the crops
i have been almost totally destroyed. The
'â  thunder at Hanover was the most severe
! experienced for thirty years. Many peo
! ple in that district were struck and killed
!by lightning. In Riesingebeirge, Silesia,
! some deaths from sunstroke were also re
! ported. One hundred draft dogs in Ber
! lin were sunstruck during the week and
j brought to the veterinary stations by the
â  police.
The announcement that Chief Justice
j Chambers is to leave Samoa is received
with great satisfaction by all sections of
I the German press. The newspapers have
all along represented Chambers as the
tool of E. B. S. Maxse, the British Consul
at Apia, and especially hostile to the Ger
mans in the island. His retirement there
fore had been regarded as necessary to
I the restoration of normal conditions. With
! the retirement of Judge Chambers the
I newspapers say the new officials at Apia
I will have an easier task. -S
The Chamber of Commerce of Upper
Franconia has petitioned the Bavarian
I Minister to use his influence with the
Government to secure lower duties on
i looking glass in the United States when
commercial treaties are arranged and
asks for a reduction of 20 per cent. The
chamber points out that the exportation
of looking glass from the Fichtel-Gebirge
region has diminished more than half
since the Dingley tariff went into effect
; and expresses fear that exportation will
Â«oon be crushed out of existence.
! Germany has been excluding cattle so
rigidly that the difference in prices has
i now become so great as to offer a lucra
tive business for smugglers, who are most
active on the German-Dutch frontier. The
i Agricultural Society of Kast Frieda has
1 called the Government's attention to the
' danger of the disease in German herds
from smuggled cattle. It is announced
that the Government will further
strengthen the customs guards.
The Kreuz Zeitung returned this weak
to the attack upon American meats, call
i ing them loathsome and highly dangerous
to health. , -__
The Agrarian Deutsche Tages Zeitung
sharply attacks American Insurance com
panies in Chicago. If. a letter signed by
Ernest Benninghoven th*- Government is
| advised before admitting American com
! panics with reckless business methods to
i inquire of German companies whether
such methods would not prove destructive.
' "The degenerating methods of great
American companies," says the writer.
! "would have a corrupting influence qn the
I Insurance business of Prussia. The Gov
i ernment is therefore asked to keep them
! out of the country."
The newspapers have revived the so
called American duel story. A medical
student hanged himself in Gruenwald the
other day. leaving a letter to his parents
in which he conveyed the impression that
he had been under a sort of obligation to
take his lit*- by a certain date. This con
stitutes an "American duel," in which all
Germans believe. -â¢ 'â â¢:â 
The first, new war vessel constructed un
der last year's naval bill was launched
this week. It is a scouting cruiser, with
engines of 9000 horse-power and a speed of
21 knots.
Tho Chamber of the Grand Duchy of
Henz has passed a law legalizing crema
i tion.
The bicycle costume has become so pop
; ular with Berlin ladles that a society is
i being organized to encourage the wearing
of "rational" dress on the streets.
The total German exports to the United
States for the fiscal year just closed
amounted to $83,744,791, against $74,228,487 in
1898. The < Jot ha Chamber of Commerce's
report says the toy Industry of the duchy
I is suffering seriously because the usual
>. orders from the United States have fallen
1 off. The diminution was first noticed in
! 1898. Prices have been reduced.

ADJOURNED COURT TO
EARN WEDDING FEES
SAN RAFAEL, July 22.â The unusual
spectacle was witnessed here to-day of a
Justice of the Peace adjourning court and
granting a recess in order that he might
perform a double marriage ceremony and
secure a fee which would otherwise have
fallen to the lot of a hated rival. As soon
as the knot was tied the judicial dignitary
calmly returned to his seat on the bench,
and after announcing that everything had
been serenely settled proceeded to call
court and go on with the trial.
Justice George Redden received a mes
sage by telephone at 10:30 o'clock this
morning stating that two couples had pro

cured a license to marry and were await
ing his presence at the courthouse. At the
time a number of persons were being ex
amined as regards their eligibility to act
as jurors in the trial of four Chinese
charged with illegal fishing off San Pedro
Point. For a minute after he got the
message the Justice sat in deep thought.
The attorneys were eager to secure a
jury on the one hand; on the other a vis
lon flitted acros his mind that Recorder
Gardner, a rival with whom Rodden has
had frequent and heated quarrels over the
performance of marriage ceremonies,
might secure the fee. The pressure proved
too heavy. and Justice Rodden adjourned
court, with the statement that he would
grant a recess of fifteen minutes.
Hastening to the courthouse he took the
principals into the Supervisors' chamber
and there married them. The persons
united were William H. Campbell and
Mrs. Margaret L. Howes, and A. C. Camp
bell and Mrs. Rosa Rowe. Receiving his j
fees, the Justice returned post haste to '
court and proceeded with the examina- j
tion.
Later in the day Walter F. Plunkett,
son of the well-known attorney, whose of
fices are in the Mills building, procured
a license and was united to Miss Ida A.
Marsh of 928 Capp street. The bride was
(if age. but as Walter was only 18 years
old his mother. Mrs. W. A. Plunkett. who
accompanied him, was obliged to give her
written consent before Clerk Graham ;
would issue the license. '

charge of a blast in the waste rock quarry
at Iron Mountain this morning. Worth
Brown was so badly injured that he died
within five minutes. Foreman Smiley of
the blasting gang had part of one hand
torn off and his eyes so badly injured that
it is doubtful if he will ever regain his
eyesight. William Nye got off more for
tunately, his injuries being not of a seri
ous nature.
The accident occurred at 3:30 o'clock
this morning. The night shift was at
work in the quarry. William Nye and
Worth Brown were putting in a blast of
black powder. Foreman Smiley was
standing near. Nye was tamping the
charge with the ordinary wooden tamp.
For some reason he changed and took a
bar of steel with which to do the tamping.
It was a fatal error. Just after he
changed tamps the explosion occurred.
The steel bar probai ly struck a flash of
fire from a rock, thus setting off the
charge.

THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION.
ALE arrangements have been made for hold
ing the Republican primaries in a manner that
will secure to every' member of the party his
right to cast an honest ballot and have it honestly
counted. That much has been gained by the energy
and the resolution of the rank and file of loyal Repub
licans in combating the schemes of would-be bosses.
It is now time to consider the next step that must be
taker, toward the accomplishment of Republican suc
cess at the polls and a good administration of munici
pal affairs.
To assure the nomination of good men it is neces
sary the convention should be composed of men who
are resolved to make such nominations. 11 is, there
fore, the duty of Republicans in every Assembly dis
trict to elect to the convention men of approved worth
and of known civic as well as party loyalty. That is
the next. step in the march to victory and good gov
ernment. It is the step which must now be arranged,
prepared for and made certain.
One of the points to be insisted upon in choosing
delegates is that no office-holder should be among
them. Of course office-holders have all the rights of
other citizens, but in this case propriety dictates they
should stand aside, and if they do not they should be
put aside by the voters. The holders of office may
rightly enough take an active part in the primaries,
but not one of them ought to hold a seat in the con
vention. The body that is to represent Republicanism
in nominating candidates for office must be composed
of men who have no personal favors to ask, or wires
to pull. They must be delegates animated by the sole
object of nominating as the candidates of the party
men who can be relied upon to be faithful in office to
every duty and responsibility intrusted to them.
Nor is that all. In addition to nominating a good
ticket, the convention must elect a body of energetic,
honest, able, reliable men as a County Committee. It
will be of little avail to nominate a strong ticket if the
committee intrusted with the management of the cam
paign be not equally deserving of public confidence.
Its membership should be carefully considered. No
man suspected with good cause to be a servant or an
ally of would-be bosses ought to have a place among
the party managers, or be intrusted with authority in
the party council during the campaign. .
These, then, are the issues before us: to elect to the
convention good men, not one of whom is an office
holder; to assure the nomination, first, of a strong
ticket and, second, the selection of a trustworthy
County Committee. To attain these desired ends it
will be necessary that the business men, the property
owners, the taxpayers and the intelligent workingmen
of the party shall from this time on give attention to
their political duties and take an active and an earnest
part in the primary elections.
The time has come for the better elements of the
people to assert themselves in the management of poli
tics. San Francisco can start her career under the new
charter with a good administration if the people so
will it. The Republican party has opened the way for
honesty to triumph and if corruption win it. will be
solely because the taxpayers have neglected their po
litical opportunities and civic duties.
A bearded lady in New York is afflicted with a dis
ease, the particular manifestation of which consists of
a swelling of the head and hands. Physicians can
readily understand how the ability to raise wdiiskers
would swell the head of any woman, but they cannot
for the life of them see how it would puff her hands.
The proprietor of a hotel at Suisun caught a man
the other day in the act of stealing his cash register.
The fellow explained that it was a joke, but the hotel
man is still of the opinion that, if he had not stopped
him, the joke would have been carried too far.
Lombroso, the great criminologist, who has been
making a long-distance study of Lieutenant Hobson
of the Merrimac, is inclined to the belief that the
y .ung naval hero is the greatest of all kissing bugs.
Superstitious people will hail with delight the news
that a trust has been formed to control the opal mines
of Mexico. No one will object to a corner in bad
luck.
THE FAMILY OF NATIONS.
â  * * .j-j ___* â¢*-* Â« l-TWOT' \J
THE United States, we are told, have incurred
certain obligations as a member of the family of
nations, and that these require that we act in
matters external by using all the powers which belong
to any sovereignty.
The objection to this view is that it ignores the char
acter and purposes of our Government. It throws
away the good example of exact justice and strict
national morality which it has been our mission and
policy to show the world. When we began govern
ment under the constitution we found that every other
sovereignty in the family of nations claimed absolute
ownership of its people, as its subjects, and denied to
them the right to cast off that ownership and transfer
themselves to the ownership or citizenship of any
other sovereignty. A necessary doctrine to the exist- j
ence of the divine right of kings was: "Once a sub- |
ject always a subject." The sovereign could sell the j
allegiance of the subject to another, but the subject
himself could not forswear or transfer it. Along
with this went the doctrine that might makes right.-
Under this the stronger sovereignty could, by cause
less invasion and conquest, forcibly seize the alle
giance and ownership of the subjects of the weaker
and the church absolved them from any sin in submit
ting to their new owner, who had the divine right to
take them if he could.
Our first great international action rose in denial
of this doctrine that might makes right and that gov
ernments own men and can deny them the right of
expatriation and the privilege of choosing their domi
cile. Persistently for more than fifty years we pressed
the right of expatriation. We ofTered not only a domi
cile but our own birthright of free citizenship to the
thralls born under the European system. We fought
the war of 1812 mostly in vindication of that right,
and in the Martin Kozsta affair declared our willing
ness to make war on all Europe in defense of a single
naturalized citizen.
We have in sentiment always denied the right of
England to hold the Irish by conquest and voice the
protest of Ireland against seven centuries of subjection
to an alien power.
We have in like manner decried the butchery of Po
land and our literature and politics are full of depre
cation of the crime by which she was mutilated like a
carcass hacked for hounds, by the powers around her.
because she was weak and they were strong. We were
in. full sympathy with France when Germany parti
tioned, her by conquest and lamented that the victor
did not satisfy herself with the great money indemnity
exacted, rather than assert the old doctrine of the
transfer of allegiance by conquest. In all of our
treaties acquiring Louisiana, Florida and what we
took from Mexico, we consistently abided by this po
sition and offered the subjects of France and Spam
and the citizens of Mexico our birthright of citizen
ship, or the full protection of all their rights if they
chose to depart and go to the flag under which they
had been subjects.
It was this position which made this republic the
hope of the oppressed and brought to our shores the
freedom-seekers of every nation. We were in the fam
ily of nations as a republic, denying every monarchical
theory which fettered the person or withheld the rights
of man to self-government and the privilege to seek
its establishment on the soil that bore him, or depart
to its enjoyment where it was already administered.
It will be seen that imperialism abandons this
wholesome principle so necessary to the continuance
of liberty! And it will be seen, also, that our position
in the Philippines is an aggravated and radical asser
tion of the ownership of man by a sovereignty, and
the right to dispose of his allegiance without consult
ing his wishes!
Therefore when we are told that we are under obli
gations to the family of nations which require our im
perial policy, it is the equivalent of saying- that we are
not permitted any longer to appear in that family as a
republic, the friend and promoter of freedom, but
must in that association recognize the thin imperial,
principles of divine right; that might makes right and
man has no personal control of his civil allegiance,
but is a rebel if he refuses to be sold or to submit to
conquest.
We have reversed ourselves, and have in one year
admitted all that we have denied since we issued the
Declaration of Independence.
DEMOCRACY AND IMPERIALISM.
BY cleverly dodging the extreme silver men, and
by carefully confining itself to what was hardly
more than clerical work, the Democratic Na
tional Committee managed to get through the meet
ing at Chicago on Thursday without taking sides with
any of the wrangling factions of the party. It was the
unexpected that happened. Instead of storm there
was stagnation.
There was no lack of opportunity for a row if the
National Committee had felt in a humor for one.
The fight between the Harrison and the Altgeld
gangs in Chicago was in full evidence during the pro
ceedings, and the committeemen were again and
again challenged to take one side or the other. Much
sad experience has taught them wisdom, however,
and they kept out of the wrangle. The result is that
so far as the National Committee is concerned no
declaration has been made as to what course the
Democratic party will take on any of the issues be
fore the country.
In the meantime the movement of the influential
leaders to get rid of Bryan goes steadily forward. It
matters not to them which way they move so long as
the course takes them far from the Chicago
platform and its champion. Senator Morgan, who
speaks with more authority than any other single
man for the Democracy of the South, has once more
declared himself in favor of new issues, and has
cheered his followers with predictions that such is
sues will be forthcoming.
In a recent interview he announced that the cam
paign of iooo would be made not on one issue, but on
many. He is quoted as having said: "The more
there are the better for us. The Congress that as
sembles in December will, in providing for the gov
ernment of our new possessions, have to modify the
tariff, which will materially strengthen the Demo
cratic position. Sugar will give you issue enough.
We can no more place a tax on sugar from Porto
Rico, Hawaii and the Philippines than we can from
Louisiana. Then, in providing for the government
of the islands, will come the arranging of a financial
system. Silver has been the only money there, there
, fore the remonetization of silver will be again de
manded by the Democrats. If we can't get free coin
age we will say give us five hundred or a thousand
millions. Once we make an inroad, the rest of the
party way will be cleared."
As if those issues were not enough to build hopes
upon, the Senator added: "Then, again, the issue
will be injected of the income tax, which no effort
has been made to collect. I shall as soon as Con
gress assembles introduce a joint resolution to require
the President to collect this tax, which will no doubt
throw it again into the Supreme Court. Still another
issue will be brought out by the reapportionment by
Republicans in Congress under the new census, and
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL., SUNDAY, JULY 28, 1899.
the action to be taken on the fourth and fifteenth
_a&vej_.dments to the constitution, as far as it relates to
States like Louisiana, for instance, which has dis
franchised the negroes. As to trusts, both parties will
denounce 'them in the strongest terms, and neither
do anything inimical to them."
There is a certain frank cynicism in that last state
ment which is characteristic of the man. "Both par
ties will denounce trusts in the strongest terms, and
neither do anything inimical to them." The state
ment is not strictly accurate, for it is to be noted the
Republican party has made no pledges concerning
anti-trust legislation it has not fulfilled. The impor
tant feature of the interview is the advantage the Sen
ator expects to gain for his party out of the im
perialist programme. Imperialism means free trade
in sugar, fruit, tobacco, rice and all the products of
the tropical islands. It also means an opening for
the issue of more fiat money. The Senator is an im
perialist. The people, however, are well aware of
those dangers and are not likely to walk into the snare
that is set for them. Imperialistic Democracy is no
more attractive than Bryanite Democracy.
SAN FRANCISCO fJND MER LIBRARIES.
SAN FRANCISCO is the only American city of
metropolitan rank that is ill equipped with libra
ries. In that respect, she is so far behind other
large cities of the Union that any comparisons on the
subject would be odious to her people. That much is
well known and understood, ami it has been the desire
of many of the more earnest leaders of the intellectual
life of the city to bring about a better condition of
affairs.
The desired end is not impracticable nor even diffi
cult of solution, and if it be sought in the right way
and by the right men may be accomplished within a
time comparatively short.
The key to the situation is the Mercantile Library
j with its handsome building, its valuable collection of
; books, its heavy mortgage and its location out of
reach of the class of people to whom .such a library
j appeals. If the Mercantile Library could be consoli
dated with that of the Mechanics' Institute there
would be at once established a large downtown library
of the first class with a patronage sufficient to main
tain and to develop it into one of the foremost of its
kind in America. The Mercantile Library building
could be sold for a sum sufficient to pay the debts of
the institution, so that the consolidation would impose
no burdens on the Mechanics' Institute.
Nor is that all. It is well known the Free Public
Library is not only inconveniently but inadequately
housed at the City Hall. The Mercantile Library
building is in a good situation for the Free Public
Library, and if purchased by the city would furnish
the Free Library at once with just the sort of edifice
it needs for its books and its work.
There are, of course, sentimental objections to
i breaking up the Mercantile. It is the oldest library in
' the city, has a history of which its supporters are
I justly proud, and it is natural many of them should
I hesitate to disestablish it. Such considerations, how
ever, are mot well supported by reason nor by a right
respect for the object of the founders of the institu
tion. The pioneers established it for the purpose of
providing San Francisco with a great subscription
library that would be of use to her scholarship, her
culture and her general education. Such was their ob
; ject, and events have brought it about that the object
I can be attained much better by union with the Me
! chanics' Institute than by maintaining the Mercantile
j as a separate institution.
San Francisco requires two libraries, one free and
public, the other maintained by subscription; the one
centrally located and distributing its books through
subordinate reading rooms in different parts of the
city, the other located downtown where the business
of the community is carried on and readily acessible
to its patrons during business hours or during the
evenings. The Institute Library is ideally situated
for the uses of business men. It is just where such a
library should be. while the Mercantile is out of the
Way. It is at the Institute Library, therefore, the
great. subscription library should be built up. By as
sisting in that work the object of the founders of the
Mercantile can be best carried out to a speedy realiza
tion and San Francisco be supplied with a library
worthy of her rank among the cities of the republic.
No doubt Mr. Chambers can keep up a reasonable
degree of courage down at Samoa by saying to him
self over and over again that the President does not
want his resignation of the Chief Justiceship, but let
us give pause. Is it of record that the President has
ever been asked?
There must be a mistake in the dispatch from
Montevideo that announces the presence of the
United States gunboat Wilmington off the mouth of
the Platte River. It cannot be that Bill Bryan has
sneaked into South. America!
LflW TANGLES fIND WAR PROBLEMS.
A CURIOUS sidelight is thrown upon the per
plexities of the administration by the decision
of the President to confide the direction of the
War Department to a lawyer rather than to a man of
military training or of executive experience. It ap
pears the legal tangles of' the Philippine imbroglio
are much more harassing than the war problems.
The selection of a lawyer for the office is not in
itself a matter of surprise. Several lawyers have occu
pied the position in times past, and one of them, Ed
win M. Stanton, proved himself during the Civil War
to be one of the most efficient organizers of military
administration the world has ever seen. None of the
former War Secretaries, however, was selected pri
marily because of a need -of a lawyer in the depart
ment. The choice of Mr. Root has been determined
01. that ground solely. It seems to be a law case and
not a campaign we are conducting against Aguinaldo.
If this view of the situation be correct, General Otis
stands blameless for not prosecuting the war more
vigorously. It may be that he is in the situation of a
bailiff who has gone out with a very large posse com
itatus to arrest Aguinaldo and his followers for
trespass "vi et armis" upon certain town lots, subur
ban tracts, farms and jungles purchased by us from
Spain. Naturally he does not wish to exceed the legal
powers of a bailiff and therefore desires counsel to ad
vise him how far he can go and where he must stop.
It would also appear that Alger's resignation was
due to no lack of administrative ability, but to ineffi
ciency as a counselor at law to the bailiffs in the field.
It will be remembered that some years ago when the
exigencies of British politics raised a lawyer to the
office of First Lord of the Admiralty Gilbert's facile
pen very neatly satirized the appointment and made it
contribute to the gayety of nations by the well known
song of the admiral in "Pinafore": "Stick close to
your desk, and never go to sea; and you'll get to be
the ruler of the Queen's navee." It was' a good song
and a merry one. Our politics now points the same
moral and the Hon. Elihu Root will have the satis
faction of serving as a- reminder to every clerk in art
attorney's office that by due attention to the practice
of law he may become the director in chief of great
imperial wars and Asiatic conquests.
EDITORIAL VARIATIONS,
BY JOHN McNfIUQHT.
From the loud expressions of delight
over the Increase ln the assessments of
the property of corporations In this
city, a casual observer would suppose
we had solved the whole problem of
taxation for municipal purposes, and
had achieved justice to all and an am
ple revenue for the city at one stroke.
The casual observer, however, would
be mistaken. Our prevalent joy and
universal congratulation is due to the
fact that we are paying more atten
tion to the one corporation brought Into
the taxation fold than to the ninety
and nine that escaped and are still
gamboling In a comparatively untaxed
freedom.
The problem of how to compel each
citizen to pay his due share of taxes,
without exacting from him one cent
more than that, remains unsolved. In
deed, its solution has never been se
riously attempted on this side of the
continent. It is different in the East;
they have more tax solvers over there
: than taxpayers â almost as many as tax
shirkers; and as a consequence, the lit
erature on Eastern tax issues ranges
from grave to gay, from lively to se
vere, and in bulk is sufficient to fill up
a library, or a junk shop.
Some years ago George H. Andrews,
Tax Commissioner of the City of Xew
York, contributed to the gayety of the
discussion of the tax problems this
summary' of a few of the Incongruities
of the tax system of that State:
A has $100,000 of imported goods, and is
exempt.
B has $100,000 of miscellaneous goods,
and is taxed.
C has $100,000 of goods consigned, and ls

D has $100000 of goods owned, and ls

E has $100,000 of goods manufactured ln
New Jersey, and is exempt.
F has $100,000 of goods manufactured In
the city, and is taxed.
G has $100,000 of goods for which he bor
rowed capital on United States bonds, and
Is exempt.
II has $100,000 of goods which he sold
United States bonds to pay for, and ls

I has $100,000 in ships plying from this
port but registered in Boston, and ls ex

J has $100,000 ln ships plying in the Pa
cific but registered here, and is taxed.
X has $100,000 in mortgages on New Jer
sey property, interest paid in Jersey City
and mortgages deposited there, and is ex

L has $100,000 in mortgages on city prop
erty, and is taxed.

To that list running from A to Z of
the absurdities of i New York taxation,
! Commissioner Andrews added: "If the
alphabet had been longer, my tale had
been stronger." Since the statement
1 was made many of the incongruities
specified have been removed, but
' enough remain to fill the list again, in
: case any one should desire to do so;
! and California is in as bad a plight as
; New York was before the reform move
j ment started itself and then started all
the . big personal property owners to
J moving their domicile to New Jersey.
Taking State taxation as a whole
I throughout the Union, it will be found
! that the burdens rest mainly upon
I those who are either too honest or too
I stupid to evade them. We tax honesty
! and ignorance rather than property,
I and consequently whenever we catch
something neither honest nor ignorant
and compel it to pay taxes, we feel like
, making a civic holiday and shouting
j for joy.
A universally satisfactory solution of
j tax problems is not likely to be at-
I tamed by this generation. The people
know what they wish, but they do not
know how to accomplish it. We have
achieved smokeless powder, wireless
: telegraphy, horseless vehicles and
! lightless photography, but what we are
; most earnestly yearning for is a tax
! less government.

. Yachting experts, and persons who
i expect to make big bets on the coming
j contest for the America's cup, are
; watching the trials of the Columbia
! and the Shamrock with something mor*
I than ordinary curiosity. They are
j seeking for facts on which. base an
' estimate of the relative chances of the-
I competitors; and a good many of them
I believe they have found it.
The races at Cowes between the Bri
j tannia and the Vigilant are taken as a
j basis for the calculations. The two
! yachts were about equal, taking one
i kind of wind and sea with another. The
j Vigilant returned to this country and
j went into trial races with the Defen
! der, the result of which showed the
I Defender could beat the Vigilant in a
thirty-mile race by an average of five
minutes and fifteen seconds. From
that record the conclusion is the De
fender is about that much superior to
the Britannia, and therefore if the
i Shamrock can beat the Britannia by
! six minutes she is clearly in the De
| fender's class.
Now the Columbia is being tried out
| in a series of races with the Defender,
j and the Shamrock is being tried out
I against the Britannia; and as a conse
j quence the results of the matches will
afford a fairly good basis upon which
to found an estimate of the compara
| tive merits of the two competitors.
Despite the seeming .simplicity of the
problem, however, there are wide di
vergences in the estimates. A British
expert figures out the Shamrock must
beat the Britannia twenty minutes in
a thirty-mile course in order to have
a chance- to win, while a New York
authority estimates she will have a
chance if she can beat the Britannia
by .fifteen minutes. There are others
who- assert the two yachts are about
equal and the victory will go to that
which is best handled in the race. The
j only unimpeachable conclusion to be
drawn from lt all is that it Is safest
not to bet.

over the kissing bug is a striking illus
tration of the old proverb, "We always
see what we look for." The American
Union existed for more than a hun
dred years, and ln all that time no one
of the vast population within its wide
domain ever saw a kissing bug. Now,
in the height of the summer, which is
so justly called "the silly season," there
comes out of the East a story that a
kissing bug has made his appearance
at the watering places along the At
lantic coast, and all at once the crea
ture appears simultaneously all over
the United States; and every commun
ity has its thrilling tale to tell of the
terrors of the creature's kiss.
Is there any such thing as a kissing
bug?
Lots of creatures of various kinds and j
sizes have been taken by various kinds |
and sizes of people to various kinds and j
sizes of entomologists, and each ento
mologist has been assured by each vis
itor that his or her particular speci
men is the bug that does the kiss
ing; and the entomologist has been gen
erously informed that if he would name
it he could have it. In every case the
creature thus submitted to the investi- j
gation of science has been found to be ,
a very old sort of thing, and in no case '.
has any scientist indorsed one as a kiss- I
ing bug.
â¢ â¢ â¢
The sensation has not been anything
like so severe on this coast as in the
East. With us it is but a nightmare; j
with them it is a delirium tremens. j
Comparatively few bugs have been sus- j
pected in California, but along the At- I
lantic coast all kinds of creatures have |
been arrested and charged with being I
guilty of stinging kisses.
In Philadelphia a story got around j
that entomologists and the professors
of the Medical College would pay $10 I
apiece for the kissing bug, and for days :
thereafter lt almost rained bugs on
every scientific man in town. It is said
the insects offered were of all varie
ties, including such harmless and well
known things as katydids, grasshop
pers and undeveloped butterflies.
To an interviewer, seeking informa
tion on the subject, Mr. Samuel Hen*
shaw of the Agassiz Museum at Har
vard admitted that he didn't know any
thing of the creature and .could give
no information to a public yearning for
knowledge. He said he had been asked
a great many questions regarding the
mysterious insect, and "had examined
several specimens of horseflies pre
sented to him for critical opinion," but
he had not found anything like the
kissing bug of the summer resort tales.
Professor Chope of the Field Museum
in Chicago has also had occasion to ex
amine a varied selection of insects sent
in by a wild populace, but he, like the
rest, has found no kissing bug. The
most frequently accused creature is the
bug bearing the learned name of Me.
lanolestes picipes. but Professor Fuchs,
entomologist of the California Academy
of Sciences, told a writer for this paper
that, to term that creature a kissing
bug "is surely not right."
Thus from the Atlantic to the Pa
cific sea, science knows not the kissing |
bug. and it is safe to bet he is no more
than a humbug.

Daniel F. Leary, who announces him
self as a toiler in a mill, grinding ink
and paint, has found in the rhythmical
beat of the machinery and the melody
that sings through its noises an inspi
ration to poetry. He says: "A paint
factory is not the best training camp, '.
and yet there may exist an unseen tie
between the grinding of printer's ink
and the grinding of verses; and if so,
thirty-five years at the paint grinder's
art, with brain a swinging to the swing
of my mills, should place my mind ir. I
the majestic 'swing of the Pleiades,'
said by Mr. Markham to be beyond the
reach of a 'Man With the Hoe.' "
As an evidence of his faith in the mill
muse, he submits to the judgment of
the public these verses:
LOVE AMONG METAPHORS.
Birth is a curve, love, and Death is its !
mate;
And Life is the clause, love, that's held
at low rate;
And minor the key is; 'tis rung in by Fate.
This world would naught be without it.
â .'â  â¢. rf 7 ' "
Between these two curves, love, together j
we two,
So close to my heart I would swing, sweet,
with you:
And your eyes would be heaven forever
In viewâ
My life, love, is worthless without you.
And Time is a sea, love, and Life is a !
wave,
And Birth is the starter; the goal ls the j
grave.
â¢Tis mighty rough riding, this billow we
crave
The ride, love, is lonely without you.
And Hope ls a truant who swims all the
. day;
"With the last as the first, love, he's ripe
for the fray; ./â¢;
And he'll keep on a-awimming till the last
fade away
But life would be flat, love, without him.
And Birth is a gate, love, and Life ia the
way;
And heaven a playground, I've heard peo
ple say;
And Death is the fee for admission we
payâ
Your love would be pass-key without it
Is Birth, too, a 'bus, love? And Life is the
inn
Where Revel and Riot so oft raise a din.
But the lover and loved are safe snuggled
in â v.- 7
My life is a riot without you.
This life is a riddle, and Love is the key.
To unravel the riddle, love, labor with me;
And, Love need a breeches, we'll raise a
fig tree â
For Cupid's so nude, love, without It.

If there be not merit and a musical
lilt In those verses, I know not the dif- !
ference between genius and a gram- |
marian. The last stanza is something i
of a puzzler from a poetic point of view,
but there's humor in it, and .something I
of realism, for in this prosaic world I
love may "need a breeches'' occasion- j
ally; and fig leaf trouserings would be |
at any rate better than an Examiner !

Life would be duller without It.

Â»$ Those who ad
. * AVOTHFR t mire the modesty
AINUintK and re ticence of
GREAT the Examiner are
cyaMIVPp heaping eulogies
EXAMINER on that gheet for
1 RESCUE. the diffidence it
? A *.? displays in not
â¦* " heralding to the
world its latest effort at rescue and the
alleviation of human suffering. They say
that while they cannot help applauding
the noble self-abnegation that has always
characterized that conservative and non
sensational publication, of fireside fiction,
yet in justice to itself it should make
known to the public its heroic efforts in
behalf of those unfortunate hill tribes
who, amid the mountains of Belvedere,
have been undergoing all the awful suf
ferings of a prolonged thirst.
The story of the drought, of the demon
stration against Coop, of the hardships
endured and the fortitude displayed by
the residents of the Sahara of the Pacific,
who for days subsisted with nothing over
their heads but a roof, and nothing around
them to drink but hard and soft liquor,
has already been told in these columns.
Here is the story of the Examiner's latest
rescue.
Among the curious things incident to
Belvedere is one of those wonderful in
sects catalogued by naturalists under the
general head of "Special Commissioners
and Embassadors Extraordinary of the
Daily Examiner."
When the water famine came he saw
his chance, and standing upon the high
est mountain top he, like Moses of old,
promised to find for them a paradise and
water in the desert.
The day before yesterday the special
embassador, awakening from his slumber,
proceeded to the top of his house and
gazed into his tank. He found It as dry
as the columns of his own paper. Swear
ing softly to himself, he took the boat for
this city, his head sunk upon his breast
with the weight of the stupendous scheme
his brain was evolving. Arriving on this
side, he proceeded to his paper, where
a special meeting of the heads of the de
partments was called while he unfolded to
them his massive Idea. They listened and
were overcome by its magnitude. But
what can stop the Examiner when rescue
is the slogan?
The idea was adopted, and a short time
afterward a sprinkling cart filled with
clear, cool water and drawn by two mag
nificent horses was seen to go on board
the Tiburon boat. It arrived at the other
side and. guided by the Extraordinary
Embassador, it proceeded* to his house.
There it halted while he mounted to the
roof and again gazed into the tank. Be
hold! It was filled to the brim with
water.
The explanation is simple. Water has
been running in Belvedere for days. He
simply did not know enough to turn on
the cock. The Examiner has a watering
cart and a span of horses it will give
away to the next person who will send in
a prepaid subscription for one month.

For Motormen to Use in Calling

Edward C. Bates of Boston, Mass., pro
poses to transfer the duty of calling out
street names from the conductor to the
motorman of a street car, whose attention
is not diverted by collecting fares and
making change. In order to make this
duty convenient for the man on the front
platform a hinged mouthpiece, is fixed to
the under side of the car roof, on the end
of a tube leading into the interior of the
car. He has only to call out the street
as It is approached, and his words are car
ried into the middle of the car, where
every one can hear them. When it hap
pens that this particular end of the car
is being used by the conductor the mouth
piece is turned up but of the way.

HOT WATER PROFITS.
Uncle Sam's Income From His Ar
kansas Reservation.
By ar. act of Congress, passed in April.
Â£832 when Arkansas was still a territory,
the Hot Springs, with four sections of
land, were sot aside for the future dis
posal of the 'En. ted States. By the act
of March. 1577. the appointment of Com
nLisllorier? was authorized to lay out into
lots an*! streets certain tracts of land in
Carkr.nl County, a part of the Hot
Spf'ngs reservation. The levying of a
special 'ax on water taken from the hot
springs vas authorized; tho money aris
ing from water rents to be used In im
proving the reservation. By the act of
June. I^SO. these divisions of the _ Hot
Sprinrs reservation known as North
Mountain; West Mountain and Sugar
oat - Mountain were dedicated to public
u?<_ as paik: on a permanent reservation,
aggregating 900 acres.
The hot water issues from tho base and
side of the Hot Springs Mountain, and the
actual quantity is not known; thai which
is under control and hoing used to supply
*he bath houses amounts to about 600.000
gallons daiiy. and the amount collected
osd passed through the impounding res
ervoir about 350.000, making a total quan
tity of hot water under control of about
.SO'.OOO gallons daily. The Hot Springs are
not only under Government control, . ut
are directly managed by the United
States Government, which has an Invest
ment in them in excess if $500,000 As
shown by tho last published Treasury re
port' the total receipts from bathhouses
and hot water rent at the hot springs for
the fiscal year ended July 1, 1898. was
515. 171. The disbursements by the super
intendent for salaries, superintendence,
repairs, fuel, light and water fcold) were
$12 388. This represented a profit to the
I'nited States of $0000.
A large number of patrons of the **ot
springs are indigent persons who. unable
to pay the ordinary hotel charges or to
avail "themselves of tho paid bathing op
portunities, are supplied free. There is,
moreover, a free disoensary under direc
tion of a United States army surgeon.
The tota! number of patrons Is about 6000
a da. though the facilities of the Hot
Springs allow, as at pros.nt arranged, for
Â«000. .."The resident population of Hot
Springs is about ROOO and the average
;iumhÂ»r of persons in town patronizing
the seventy hot water springs Is about
7'"'oo additional.
The hotol bathhouses in Hot Springs re
not run by the Government directly; but
are sublet to individual proprietors, and
the rair.e course is adopted with the
"oaths not connected with hotels, the pol
irv f.f th* Government being to operate
so far as practicable tho hot springs
wiihout I'JSr- and without any large profit
By act of Congress passed in Ootober.

a system of reservoirs, piping and pumps
necessary to tho collection and economical

I veterinary surgeon, left for Oregon last
I night for the purpose of purchasing some
I hundred head of horses for use in the
! Philippine campaign. Carloads of horses
will soon begin to arrive from the East
; also. As there is but room at the Presidio
! to stable some 1000 horses the work of
transporting them must begin soon after
the first arrivals.
The results of the late war on the
I health of the soldiers are just beginning
Ito be felt at home. Eleven men from the
Indiana, incapacitated through illness,
have been removed to the hospital at the
Presidio and arrangements have been
! made to send two insane men to the
i Government Hospital for Insane Soldiers
lat Washington. y ,
Several men. among them being three
; privates of the Third Artillery, four of
the Tenth Pennsylvania and one of the
First Colorado came in on the Indiana,
having been authorized by General Otis
! to receive their discharge here. The num
ber of men who will thus arrive for mus
tering out will soon increase, although
the men prefer to leave the service at
Manila. By so doing they become en
' riched to the extent of about $500 travel
pay but as the Government chooses to be
as economical as possible the majority of
men will first be transported to the United
' States and then discharged. The matter
of the home-coming of soldiers is at pres
ent receiving less attention from the de
partment than the shipping of men to the
seat of war and hence but little is said
of the straggling arrivals from Manila.
The appointment of . Captain James
Lockett. Fourth Cavalry, to the office of
colonel of the cavalry regiment now or
ganizing at Manila has caused many ex
pressions of satisfaction among the blue
coats at the Presidio. The officer is well
and favorably known here, he having been

ART IN VARIETY
ON VIEW
AT THE ORPHEUM
Â£â EE most obstinate believer in the *
â 'Wise Guy" class of entertainment;
must, after seeing th*- travesty on
jt 'Ingomar" given by Hayes and Lyt- j
ton at the Orpheum, be convinced
that there is a clever way of being
funny and yet keeping within the ken i
of the multitude. Whoever is respon- j
sible for that travesty Is an artist.
and deserves to be told so. 'I- lifts
us to the highest flights of the romantic
and legitimate and drops us without a
scruple into the puddle of the choicest
slang, from which we emerge laugaing
and good-natured, ready for a higher
flight and a longer fall. .Mr. Hayes hav
ing been schooled In the legitimate is just
the one to give the travesty its full hu
morous value, and his inamorita has no]
excuse for calling him a "spoiler of good
parts." Th*' cakewalk exit, which they
have the good taste not to repeat on de
mand, is a situation not to be bettered
Time was when the loss of a limb wad
an ever-to-be regretted accident, but me i
Browns would tain convince us thai i
leg is an insignificant unit obstructing th 3 |
wav to vaudeville fame, and if you ara j
wise enough to lose a left while your j
neighbor loses a right you have but to
shako hands and may; jump and dance
yourselves Into a fortune. At first they j
are pathetic figures, but they seem so
happy in Cheli infirmity that they saon
make us feel we are wasting our sym
pathy. Kilpatrick and Barber, in their j
wonderful trick bicycling act. are the
perfection of grace, agility and daring I
athletic strength. Such bicycle possibili- j
ties the uninitiated would never dream
of. George Wilson has the gift of obser
vation and turns it to good account in
his monologue, telling us the funny things j
that pass unnoticed under our very noses.
1* takes a mighty clever audience to ap- j
preciate some of his jokes, and the fact
that a few of the best are lost in silence.
Is no proof that they are not immensely
clever. His political jumble of fact and
fancy ami beautiful sarcasm, if used to
stump the country, might i.*- a powerful
democratic weapon.
The Pasqualis are not happy in "Caval- !
leria." The duo loses its meaning when
separated from the score, and the spirit
of the thing is missing. Although the j
prayer compensates in a measure for
what the rest lacks, their "Cavalleria"
will never make us forget their "Faust."
Houdini is inexplicable. We might ac- .
cuse him in our own minds of trickery,
but we are forced to acquit him for lack
of evidence. He is the king of handcuffs
and the prince of hoodwinkers.
Minnie Palmer, the Rixfords and the j
tragic comedians complete an excellent
programme. This week many new at
tractions are promised.

â * â -
HOME TEAM MAKES SIX RUNS.
â â¦ â
IBERG PITCHES NINE INNINGS
OF GOOD BALL.
Â» . '
Few Hits Off thÂ© Local Twirl er and
Some Pretty Fielding Charac
terize the San Francisco-
Oakland Game.
San Francisco 6, Oakland 0.
The suburban Dudes tore up the Recre
ation Park diamond yesterday ln a vain
endeavor to score. Six times the gong
sounded for the local team; the Dudes
returned home without the memory of a
ring.
Good ball marked the entire game yes
terday. There were few errors on either
side and close, fast work was ln order
from beginning to end. Iberg pitched ex
cellent ball, only five scattered hits being
secured off his delivery. Moskiman was
not so good. Nine hits were registered
against him. and they were productive,
with the assistance of an occasional er
ror, of a half-dozen runs. But for an ex
ceptional error the local stiek-wielders'
fielding work -would have been perfect.
Fine base-throwing and quick, snappy
play satisfied the enthusiasts ln the
bleachers,, and the local following exer
cised lungs and throats on every occa
sion.
Neither side was able to score in the
flrst three innings. In the beginning of
the fourth a Moskiman shell found a tar
get In the small of Muller's back, which
sent the latter capering nimbly to the
initial bag. Krug. the smasher, rapped
out a double and Muller coursed the bags
for the first run of the day. Krug made
third by a jugglery of his long fly. When
Sullivan drove a long, high sky-stabber
to left field, which was th*' death of him.
Krug beat the bail in from third, thereby
adding another line in the score column.
In the fifth Fitzpatrick went to first
a-walking, found second on a passed ball
and chased around third bag to the haven
when Hilderbrandt let drive to deep cen
ter for a single. Riley and Sullivan
crossed the rubber in the sixth. Sullivan
found himself twisted up with another
of Moskii - spirals and he wen: to
first limping. Then Riley banged the
spherlod which would not allow its career
to be suddenly ended by Lange' s envelop
ing fists, and the fumble gave Riley a
safe position on top of first base. Sulli
van, who had stolen second, then went to
third. Swindells was next to shake the
stick, and the ball cut over third, forcing
Sullivan and Riley over the platc^berg
scored in the seventh, after which there
was no further tallying. The score:

NOVEL HIDE
Of Twenty-five Hundred Miles, Using
Thirty-six Hundred Horses.
"The most novel ride I ever experi
enced." said Count Cassinl, Russian Am
bassador to the United States, at the
Waldorf-Astoria last night, "was a jour
ney of about 2500 miles through Mon
golia, In October and November, 1897, just
after I closed my term as Ambassador at
Peking. I had decided to travel overland
through China and Russia to St. Peters
burg, a distance of 8.000 or 10,000 miles.
Two thousand live hundred miles of this
was through Mongolia, and the Chinese
officials planned my journey. They pro
vided sixty horses, and at each changing
point they had sixty horses, mating in all
Â§600 for my personal use. At the end of
each portion of the route elaborate prep
arations were made for my entertain
ment.- The roads of Mongolia are excel
lent, and we made remarkably quick time
to the. Russian frontier. My hardest ex
perience was in crossing the River Obi, one
of the greatest rivers of Siberia. The
thermometer marked 50 degrees below
zero, and the river was full of floating ice.
I ghudder yet at the thought of that river
trip. I don't know how we ever got
across, for I thought I should die with the
cold. I afterward learned that October
and November were the worst months in
the year to make such a trip."â New York

War Panorama
Is one of the war books which is likely
to be in continuous demand. It is a
panoramic record of the triumphs of
Yankee Doodle. The eagle flaps his
wings on every page, and "Old Glory"
â waves around and above every scene.
Prominent officers connected with the
war are here portrayed, as well as
many of the "men behind the guns."
Military life is pictured to the eye, from
recruiting to guard mount and skirmish
line. Nor is the ludicrous omitted. The
company cook receives the' - attention
due to ills importance; the mess is
;fho\vn; cavalry scenes are given; the
hospital arrangements are depicted; the
heroines of the Red Cross service are
displayed; street scenes in Havana,
Santiago and elsewhere are unrolled,
the new citizens or subjects (which are
they?) of Uncle Sam appear and dis-
appear as the leaves are turned.
In a word, the gazer visits the new
localities and sees the tumultuous new
life, without the risk or expense of a
sea voyage.

The little steamer Is only 60 feet long, 10 feet beam and 3 feet draft,
JL and will be well boarded up so as to prevent her from filling up and
going flown. The great difficulty will be in regard to fuel. The ves
sel can only carry a small quantity of coah and will have to stop at several
places on the way down to replenish her supply. The Magic was to have as
sisted the McDowell in carrying passengers to the military stations in the
bay, but as her builders have to turn her over at San Diego before August
1, Quartermaster Marshall will have to get another boat.

OTIS WILL BE RELIEVED
IF ROOT DESIRES IT
i NEW YORK. July 22. -A World Wash
ington special says: The new Secretary of
War will visit the President at the Hotel
Champlain during McKinley's stay there
and thoroughly discuss the military situ
ation. Plans for tin- future campaigns in
â¢the Philippines will be discussed.
It will then be determined whether Gen
eral Otis shall remain in command or
whether Root desires to make any radical
changes In the army in the Far East.
Any changes that the new Secretary may
desire to make will be favorably regarded.
Root could only secure thÂ» removal of
Genetal Otis and the assignment of an
other commander of the forces in the
Philippines through an order of the Pres
ident, as the army regulations provide
that the President shall assign command
ers to the Territorial departments. The
relations existing between the President
and the Secretary of War determine very
largely to what extent i..c headofthe War
Department is permitted to share in the

BIDS FOB, GOLD DEMOCRATS.
Bryan Makes a Plea That They Re
turn to the Fold.
ST. LOUIS, July Hon. W. J.
Bryan to-night handed to the Associ
ated Press a letter written to Urey
Woodson, National Democratic com
mitteeman for Kentucky, bearing. upon
the factional differences arising In the
ranks of the Democratic party in Ken
tucky through the nomination of Wil
liam Goebel for Governor at Louisville
several weeks ago.
Mr. Bryan goes on at length to show
Mr. Goebel's loyalty to the Chicago
platform 'and expresses a desire that
all gold Democrats shall return to the
party fold, provided they will accept
the Democratic platform and support
candidates pledged to it.
"Certainly, a victory won upon the
platform adopted by the Louisville con
vention cannot do harm, but what shall
we say of a defeat? If the Republican
State ticket is elected the Republicans
In Kentucky and elsewhere will be en
couraged and the fight of 1900 made
harder. If the Democratic State ticket
is defeated, a Republican Senator may
be elected from that State."
He then goes on to show the cause
of silver would be injured by such a
result.

the girl and beat and bruised her so that
â¢die was seriously and permanently
maimed. Mary Garcia at that time waa
only 15 years old. Since then she has

Transports Ready for Manila"De
tention Camp" on Angel Island
Ready for Returning Sick
Soldiers.
The Alaska Exploration Company's
steamer Del Norte and the Alaska Com
mercial Company's steamer Portland
sailed yesterday with passengers and
freight for the Klondike and Cape Nome
and the Alaska Exploration Company's
Homer arrived from St. Michael with one
hundred passengers and nearly a million
dollars in treasure.
The vessels going north did not carry
many passengers. The Portland took
' away about twenty and the Del Norte not
so many. The travel to Dawson seems. to
be nearly all via Skaguay and Dyea. The
Del Norte took up a deckload of cattle
; and a very valuable cargo of mining sup-
I plies. The Portland carried all the freight
] she could pack.
The Homer brought. down six boxes of
' gold dust consigned to the Alaska Ex
ploration Company and three boxes con
signed to the Bank of British Columbia.
The value of these could not be ascer
tained, but probably in conjunction with
what the passengers brought with them
the steamer carried from $750,000 to
$1,000,1 . .'â 'â¢â¢â -:
G. Ai derson is a speculator and his
speculations must have turned out well,
for he brought back with him $50,000. J.
Burke and B. Murphy have good claims
on El Dorado Creek. They brought down
i $35,000 and $15. respectively. C. E. and
I O. Letonaneau brought down $20,000 with
! them and Mr. and Mrs. R. G. Patterson
\ made $10,000 at Grand Forks running a
! restaurant. They have come here to en
j joy a well earned holiday. Mr. and Mrs.
I O. Hoffman, Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell, Joe
! Hub] v. Frank Francis and George W.
j Taylor all did well and brought more or
| less cash with them.
These people presented the bright side
I of the story, but there were plenty among
'â  the Homer's passengers who never want
| to see Alaska again. Some of them were
i minus fingers, others had lost pieces of
i their ears, while many bad parted from
I neariv all their toes from frostbites. Mrs.
I E. J.Latta. M. I >. . was so sick that she
! had to be carried from the steamer to the
i wharf. L. Brown sold his claim for $50.
--! 000 and brought the money down with
him. He was frostbitten during his stay
i in the Klondike and all his money would
' not tempt him to go through the experl
j ence again.
The work of coaling the transport Indi
i ana was begun yesterday and the vessel
; will be got ready to send back to Manila
|as quickly as possible. To-day she will
I take the Tartars place at the government
! wharf, where she will be painted white.
. The Newport is nearly ready at the Mall
I dock and will probably*' sail Tuesday.
Captain John Barneson, superintendent
of the government dock, got into a row
with one of the wharf hands and was
: arrested In consequence. A man named
C. F. Bradley became impudent and Cap-
I tain Barneson gave him a much needed
j lesson. The captain was arrested on a
; charge of battery, and at once gave $50
fash bail.
The "detention .camp" on Angel Inland
is now ready for use, and should any if
the tranports have to go Into quarantine
all the m>-n on her can be cared for in
I the new camp. The otlicers' quarters are
; ready, the hospitals are equipped, the
[tent floors are down, the cooks' quarters
; are ready and all the safeguards against
contagion have been provided. There is
! ample accommodation for -1500 men. and
that Is as many as any- one transport will
bring in.
Should a vessel arrive with some con
tagious disease aboard the soldiers and
crew will be landed at th*- detention camp
and the vessel will go to the quarantine
! hulk to be fumigated. After being fumi
gated she will dock and be got ready for
another voyage to Manila. Over 200 men
have been working night and day to pre
' pare the' camp. Last night Peterson's
I launch Sybl went over and brought about
: fifty of them to the city, and this morn
! ing took them over again. The "deten
j tion camp" is near the quarry, a hill" sep
arating it from the quarantine station.
The wreck of th*- American ship John
R. Kelley. which went ashore in Port
Stanley, F. 1., has been sold for $1000.

SOLITUDE A CONVICT.
SAX QUENTIN PRISON, July 22.-Not
until to-day did the fact leak out that
the William Phelan who was sent to the
incorrigible ward at the meeting of the
Board of State Prison Directors last Sat
urday was the convict who was concerned
in the plot which resulted in the stabbing
of Guard James McDonald by Convict
Jacob Oppenheimer. It required a change
of Wardens to effect justice in the case
of a man who is known to be a desperate
and abandoned character, a prisoner three
guards had petitioned to have placed in
the dungeon because of his threat against
life at a critical period.
Shortly after Oppenheimer stabbed Mc-
Donald, Phelan and "Frisco Slim" threat
ened the lives of Guards Leahy. Yoho and
Morrow. These men went to Captain Ed
gar and were unable to obtain relief. They
managed-'to interest Captain Birlem, and
Birlem made a personal appeal to Warden
Hale, who sustaiue.! -'the- stand taken by
Edgar. It was prophesied at the time that
it would only be a short time until one or
both of the convicts tried to take human
life.
A few days before the Prison Directors
met this prophecy was proved to be
grounded on a good acquaintance with
the prisoners in question. Phelan got into
an altercation with a fellow inmate and
struck him on the head with a roller
bobbin, laying' open his scalp and inflicting
so ugly a cut that the victim was sent to
the hospital. Warden Aguirre investigated
Phelan's record and told the board he
should be sent to the incorrigible cell.

CLOSE OF THE ASSEMBLY.
PACIFIC GROVE, July 22.â One of
the most successful Chautauqua as
semblies ever held on this coast closed
at this place to-day after an unusually
busy two weeks' session. The board
of managers feels that never before
has the work of the Chautauqua been
given such an impetus toward greater
progress on the Pacific Coast.
To-day was given up mainly to Evan
gelist Sam Jones of Georgia, two lec
tures being delivered by him for the
final "Forum Hour." The subject un
der discussion was "Sloyd Manual
Training." The classes and schools
held their final session this morning,
having completed brief but creditable
courses along all the lines undertaken.
While the work of the assembly
closed to-day the final exercises will
occur to-morrow, and the day will be
one of the most interesting of the
Chautauqua term.

There are many ins and outs of married
life that bachelors wot not of. But they
ar*> not of the sort now being experienced
by Mrs. James B. Steele of 307. N'oe street.
Mrs. Steele was out; she is now in, and

Mrs. Steele was a Miss Nash up to two
days ago. then submitting to the blandish

his and took up her residence at SO3 Noe
street. Now -Steele is keeping house for
himself, awaiting the time when the law
shall relinquish its grasp on his bride and
allow her to go forth from the prison cell
where she now languish! It all came
about in the following fashion:
Mr. ami Mrs. Steele started out to call
on their many friends and receive those
congratulations which they knew would
be theirs as soon as their acquaint
were made aware of the new relation that
existed between them. They called at
many places, and nowhere were they dis
appointed. No; only did they receive Con
gratulations" but other things which are
generally put up in black bottles were
showered upon or into them as well,
These did not mix with the humidity of
th.- atmosphere; and the result was that
which in the vernacular ol the day is
known as a "rosy jag" was acquired by
both the groom and his tender bride.
The jag of Mr. Steele, was merely an or
dinary'; everyday one. thai had none of
the ornate trimmings which go so far to
make these peculiar; incidents events in
the life of the average mortal. Bui Mr
Steele made up for all that was lacking

two officers and a patrol wagon to quell.
Arriving at the station Mrs. Steele was
booked for being obfuscated, and refusing
to remain quiet was cast into interior
darkness to ponder over the bobtail flush

SANTA BARBARA, July 22.â
National Educational Association week
at Santa Barbara was brought to a fit
ting close by the .exciting and well
contested races and polo game at the
Agricultural Park to-day. All of the
counties around were represented.
Francis T. Underhill drove a magnifi
cent four-in-hand of sorrels, and Wil
liam Oothout Jr. and Charles Stillwell
divided honors for. the best tandems.
Among the spectators were Judge
Daingerfield of San Francisco and his
mother, D. Stephenson, Mrs. Stephen
son and Miss Rice of Los Angeles; Mr.
and Mrs. Norman J. Stewart of Aro
mas, Mr. and Mrs. J. P. Norman of
San Francisco, Mr. and Mrs. William
Oothoul and Mr. and Mrs. Francis T.
Underhill of New York. J. A. Boyd of
Los Olivos and many others of the no
tables of Santa Barbara and vicinity.
Dr. Park ami his young son rode ovei
from Montecito and Dixey Thompson
loomed up on his $5000 saddle.
The events commenced with a trot
ting race of three-quarters of a mile
ami repeat between Otto Wood, alias
Mysterious Joe, owned by H. A. Wil
liams and driven by J. A. Cody, and El
Moro^ owned by H. T. R. Vail, and
driven by "Peachy" Manchaka. The
latter is a Directum horse, and the
former by Silkwood. out of Racotta.
The first heat was won by El Moro in
1:47 by ten lengths, Ottowood breaking
shortly after leaving the post. The
second heal was a repetition of the
first, except that El Moro won in a
walk by forty yards in 1:48. The stake
was $300 and quite a considerable
amount of money was won and lost.
The next race was for a trophy of
fered'by E. Dunn of the Arlington Ho
tel. The competitors were C. T. Thay
er's Gypsy Girl and Charles W. Ea
land's Rosebud. The terms were the
same as in the first race, viz.: three
quarters of a mile and repeat. The
first heat was very exciting and a close
finish resulted. Rosebud broke imme
diately after the start, but Mr. Ealand
pluckily hung on, caught his opponent
at the distance and came in a winner
by a head. The second heat was one
not frequently seen in matches. Rose
bud again broke shortly after the drop
of the Hag to an even start,, but Mr.
Ealand immediately began to make up
tii*' lost ground.
lie was rapidly lessoning the distance
between himself and the leader, when
his mare again broke and the heat
seemed irretrievably lost. Neverthless,
Mr. Ealand hung pluckily on ami at
the distance flag but a foot of daylight
separated Rosebud from the leading
sulky. Thou, with a rare burst of
speed, the game little mare caught up
to Gypsy Girl, ran neck-and-neck for a
moment, and passed the wire a scant
nose ahead. A tremendous outburst of
cheering greeted the winner, and Mr.
Ealand was seized by some admirers
and carried to the judges' stand.
A quarter-mile running race succeed
ed, between a horse owned by Mr. Cal
lahan and one owned by Mr. Ealand,
the former winning in twenty-five sec
onds.
The concluding racing event was run
after the polo game, in which Messrs.
Botner, Redington, Stillwell, Fernald
and Ealand took part, the competitors
riding their own polo ponies. The race
was a furlong dash and was won by
Mr. Betner in it seconds, C. W. Ealand
second and Reginald Fernald third.
The polo game was between two
scratch teams, [covering green and rod
sashes for contradistinction. The first
was composed of W. S. Betner of Riv
erside, Captain L. Redington, W. Colby j
and C. Stillwell. The rods consisted of
C. W. Ealand, Dr. Smith. F. Wilson
and J. Rogers. The members of tic- \
team not playing to-day are J. Fith- '<

but eight times and its showing: to-day i
was quite creditable, but it will have
to work hard before it can hope for.
success against such veterons as its
opponents.
Mr. Ealand would become a very fine !
player, but he lacks coolness, and his
play, though brilliant, is not steady. ;
Withal, his judgment is good and he is;
quick of decision in emergencies. Some j
of his drives were worthy of a veteran.
The first ten-minute period was a
very one-sided affair, the greens win- â 
ning three goals. Mr. Betner made a
remarkably well-aimed drive of thirty j
yards for one, and achieved the second
by a steady and scientific dribble over
half the field. The third was a "fluke"
hit by Stillwell. In this first hall of
the game the four greens were opposed
by practically only two reds. Ealand |
and. in a lesser degree. Dr. Smith, the
other two seeming to be everywhere '
where they should not have been. It is. j
however, only fair to them to say that j
the judge, Roland Thomas, appeared I
to greatly impede their efforts, possi- j
bly the result of Ignorance combined
v. ith a weight too heavy for his pony to j
carry.
The second half of the game was sig- '
nalized by the brilliancy of Ealand's j
play. Once, when a goal seemed im.
minent, he rushed in and carried the i
ball to the off .if the red goal, securing
thereby a free try which carried the j
ball into the enemy's ground and near
iv effected a goal.
Some of the drives in this half were
magnificent and had he received effi
cient backing or had the greens had a ,
less efficient player than Betner for
their captain, a win for the reds would
inevitably have resulted. As it was,
only the Vail of time saved the greens
from the loss of a goal. Mr. Betner is
coaching the Santa Barbara team al
ternately with Mr. Moore of Riverside I

COMPLAINTS OF CANADIANS.
Object to the Seizure of Boats and
Fishing Nets.
VANCOUVER, B. C. July 22.â There is
much indignation among Canadian salmon
fishermen at what they consider the arbi
trary action of the United States fishery
Officers in seizing a number of boats and
salmon nets, detaining the men at Blame
several days and confiscating the nets.
The cause is allege fishing in American
waters, which arc nine miles each side of
Point Roberts. Fishermen complain that
there are no buoys or lights to mark the
line.
it is claimed that the Americana are
pursuing the policy in retaliation for the
new alien laws, whicii prevent Americans
from taking out fishermen's licenses. The
Canadians also declare thai alien fisher
men are harrying the halibut banks In
British waters and destroying the indus
try. The Canadian Government is being
asked to put on a fast fisheries cruiser
and seize American poachers.
Trampled Upon by a Horse.
SAX QUENTIN, July 22.â Mrs. Ada
O'Connor, who lives at 12 Madison street,
San francisco, was severely injured in an
accident to-day while on a visit to rela
tives. She had just alighted from a cart
when the horse suddenly backed and
threw, her to the ground. The unfortunate
woman was unable to arise in time to Â«-
i.ii"' being trampled upon and . was
dragged from under the animal's feet In
an almost unconscious condition. Dr.
Casey, the prison physician, found that
two of Mrs. O'Connor's ribs were bro
ken. She Is* now confined to her bed, but
will be able to return home in two or
three weeks unless internal injuries were
received.

The cakewalk carnival Is a thing of the
' past, and the thousands of spectators who
; have thronged Mechanics' Pavilion every
night for the past week must now seek
other sources of amusement and enter
tainment. The wind up of the carnival was
fully as brilliant, as the opening, while the
attendance was greater by* far than on
; any previous night. Kig audiences have
been the rule, and there have been no ex
ceptions, but last night the spectators
swarmed into the mammoth building in
droves. Tiny filled the seats and the
'. aisles, crowded into the galleries four
deep, and even invaded the big band stand
'in their efforts to secure places from ,
i which they could view the spectacular
: panorama being enacted on the floor be
low. A conservative estimate of the. num
ber present is 7000. and every one of them
was equipped with a well developed pair
of lungs, which were kept working *11 the -
evening.
The uproar of applause began the mo
ment the grand pageant, headed by Mis.-:
Pearl Hickman as drum major, made its
entry, and there was hardly a moment
from thai time forward when some one
of the many cakewalkers was not receiv
. ing evidence of the approval of the audi
ence. The principal interest was. of
course, centered in the finals of the cham
pionship contest and in the juvenile art-,
ists' exhibitions.
The former was between J. Walker Cole
and .Miss Georgiana Brown, ami R. Mc-
Mahon and .Miss Annie Kelly. Each
couple was allowed ten minutes on the
floor to show what they could do. All
four had been on every night during the
week and those In the audience who had
seen them before thought they knew
about what kind of an exhibition to ex
pect, but they were shown some steps
that they had never dreamed of. Each
couple had something new to spring and
the applause that greeted their efforts
showed how well they were appreciated.
. The judges. after long deliberation,
awarded the lianasome diamond cham
pionship medal to Mr. McMahon and Miss
Kelly on the ground thai their exhibi- i
tion came nearer to being the genuine
i plantation cakewalk, hut they announced
! thai if the contest had been for the most
! graceful walkers the prize would have
â¢ been awarded to Mr. Cole and Miss ;
I Brown.
The juveniles gave an excellent exhibi
tion, which was followed by a special con- j
I i.si between Harry Mangels and Etta
; Aronson. winners of the firsl prize Pri
â  day night, and Blanche Trelease and
Cladvs Montague. The judges awarded
1 the balm to the former couple, thus:
i clinching the decision rendered on the
I previous night. All the little folks were \
I then presented with prizes, those especial- :
i lv favored; in addition to the two couples \
above named, being Frankie Buttner and
Marguerite Cronin, Johnnie Mangels and
Cora Davis, Freddie Keene and Irene
Wilson.
The society amateur cakewalk was won
b> Harry Caro and Bernie Dougherty, John
and Margaret Steward, the colored cham
pions of ih*-. Pacific Coast, issued a chal
lenge to the winners of the professional
contest. The Stewards then gave an ex
hibition of the genuine article that
brought down the house.
The carnival closed with a grand pa
rade of the winners in the various con
tests and a social dance. The unqualified
success of the carnival has been a sur
prise to the general public, but it was not j
altogether .-* surprise to those who were
familiar with the enormous amount of
work In preparing for the affair which
was performed by . those having it .in '
corner of Sixth and Market streets
and the driver. Sam Tomsk., got off
the wagon to urge him along. The
horse kicked him In the stomach and
got one leg over th.. shaft. Tomsky
threw the reins to a passer-by and the
latter, becoming frightened, let go of
them and the horse dashed on the side
walk, which was crowded with people,
and made for the show window. The
terror-stricken promenaders fortunate
ly got out of harm's way.

REPUBLICAN BOSSES
ESTABLISH A COLONY
Desperate Attempt to Stuff the
Twenty=Eighth.
Notorious Brick Dolan Had His floward=Street Resort
Crowded With Illegal Voters When Discovered
by the Election Commissioners.
C. 3HE corrupt bosses are not hold- j
ing off their fight to control the j
primaries until the day of elec-
I tion. That it is begun and that
the men who are engineering it I
| realize the desperate strait the activity
of the anti-boss element has put their ,
cause in was demonstrated yesterday,
when a scheme, already in operation,
to colonize the Twenty-eighth and j
Twenty-ninth Assembly districts was
discovered by th*- Election Commission
ers. The job was uncovered by the in- .
' advertence of the notorious "Brick"
Dolan, one of the bosses' most disrepu
table lieutenants and heelers, who had i
gone into the Registrar's office with a j
! bunch of colonists from his hotel in j
tow.
As a result of it. I "dan was thrown
: out Of the office and the game of the
machine is to be blocked by an investi
gation to be set on foot Monday by the
â¢ Commissioners.
Dolan conducts a 10 and 20 cent lodg
ing-house at 675 Howard street. II :S
place has been the chief resort for |
every heeler in the district since that
[combination first went into politics, and
| on the occasion of every primary for
years past has been used as a coloniz
ing center by the gang. Pursuing the j
I same tactics this year, the bosses' j
I henchmen have been rounding up
everything In the shape <*r a vote that
| had no place in which to sleep, and it
has been the duty of Dolan to lodge I
them, coach them on how best to avoid
discovery and then attend to the trans- i
i fer of their registrations.
It was with a ragged, drunken crowd j
j of these he came int.* the Registrar's j
I offii yesterday afternoon. He got his fol- j
' lowing into line and stayed with them
! as they worked their way up to the j
j desk to help them out if they should â¢
I get into difficulty during their exam- !
i ination. He was immediately spotted i
i by Registrar Steppacher and Officers
Steve Bonner and James Aiken, who j
i had been especially detailed to watch
for such work as Dolan and his crowd j
i were attempting.
"How long has this gang been in the
precinct, Dolan?" asked Steppacher.
, "Thirty days," replied Dolan.
"What room in your house are they
in?" And then the gang got rattled j
and wanted to stampede. Dolan calm- j
j lv answered that they were in rooms
10 and 11. and a glance at a list that
had been kept showed that there were
' already over thirty good votes trans
ferred to the same two rooms. The of
ficers promptly grabbed Dolan and
threw him through the door into the j
I corridor with an injunction not to re- i
I turn.
On Monday Dolan will be cited to ap
pear before the Election Commission *
and account for every lodger in his
house, and a thorough inspection will I
j be made of every lodging house in the
| district, as it is known to the commis- ;
I sion that the same work is going on all

G Ames-Robblns wedding was
th.c only ripple on the surf.. <,f
the social wave that has rolled
in during the past week. All
ii pleasures and joys and delights
that the select indulge in these days are
those that are associated with the swell
resorts arid fashionable country homes,
and the social programme mapped oat
for the next two months all tends in the
same direction.
Already extensive preparations are be
ing made for the week of oony racing it
Del Monte, and the indications an that
the August -week of sports will surpass
by far the <>ld days when the "pigeon
shoot" whs the thing.
The Pacific Coast Pony .Racing and
Steeplechase Association has decided to
extend its three days' outing at Del
Mont.- to a week, commencing on August
21. in order to make room for al! the
sports now on the programme. Its own
especial day wil be the last, which will
be devoted entirely to pony racing. '< it
be/ore that will come polo, baseball,
cycling, pigeon shootlrg. racing-
for wb'ch Harry Simpkiris will nominate
his netv bor.;. Diike, E. A. Wiltsee will
nominate hir schooner and at least two
other entries will be madeâ ar.d golf. I:t
the last named sport, in addition to th"
George (.''rocker enp. which is to bÂ»? won
in an open hand-cap tournament for !a
dies, other prizes will be offered, and a
prominent golfer in Southern California
is agitating the project of an interstate
tournament in which a team from ih .
north shail contest with a team from the
south.
The Burlingame -â :--. Club has de
cided to bold its ope-n-a'-r horse show in
the first week in Scpto-mr-or. a decision
which will in all ability set a* rest
the project of reviving the horse shows
that have heretofore been held in town in
November or DeÂ«*errber
Some of the leading spirits of the club
think that it should be more than a hors â 
show. Similar country clubs in the East
hold annual fairs, where are shown no*
only fine horses and brilliant equipages^
but cattle, sheep, poultry and other live
stock. The gentlemen alluded to see no |
reason why the Burlingame Country Club
should not be as broad .-is its Eastern pro- |
tct.ypes. arid they hop* to make it so.
They aim to extend the club that It shall
include all the property owners and farm
ers in its neighborhood, and that its an
nual exhibitions shall do as much for all
livestock as the horse shows have done
for horses and horsemanship.

WHY GRAFTERS GET MUNICI

â â
Association Advises the Supervisors
to Buy Fire Department Sup
plies in the Open Market,
on Monthly Estimates.
The Merchants' Association has sub
mitted to the Board of Supervisors a
plan of procedure to be followed by the
city in purchasing supplies for the Fire
Department. It is a plan laid down
along solid business lines and on the
same business principles which the
hard-headed members' of the associa
tion have rigidly adhered to in build
ing up their own successful concerns,
It does away entirely with the present
ill-conditioned and extravagant method
and instead of yearly schedules and
contracts suggests monthly statements
and an open field for all reputable mer
chants.
The communication accompanying
; the plan, which was filed yesterday,
' criticizes severely every detail of the
i system now in vogue. It points out the
! innumerable weak spots and tells
pointedly why it is that scarcely one
; reputable merchant in the city will do
business with the municipality. As an
: explanation of why city business has
i fallen Into the hands of grafters and
i brokers, who get from two to six prices
for everything ordered, it is complete
i and thorough.
The communication as filed is ap
pended:
Firstâ We find that it is Impracticable
and inadvisable to prepare a schedule
containing all the articles required by
the Fire Department during the year.
Secondâ We believe that it is not ad
visable to advertise for bids and contract
for duplies for as long a time as one year.
Thirdâ believe, after considering the
question thoroughly and giving due
weight to the troubles which have arisen
over this nfatter heretofore, that the en
tire system of purchasing supplies in
vogue "at the present time is unbusiness
like, is not. economical and is opposed to
. the 'public interest. ry >: . . -
In support of these conclusions we beg
to call the attention of your honorable
'board to the following facts:
First -The schedules as heretofore sub
â  mitted for bids do not specify in any way
: the probable quantity required of each
article. It is perfectly evident that in
| many of these articles the quantity re
quired to a great extent determines the
price. To ask a firm to bid intelligently
i for an article when it is not known
| whether there will be required a gross or
only half a dozen is to ask an impossibili
ty, and the city undoubtedly suffers from
such a method.7, â¢ -:
Secondâ contracts at present not
only .all for an Indefinite quantity but
also require the successful bidders to fur
nish the articles at a specified price at
any time during a year's time. It is well
known that the cost of many goods, par
ticularly In the hardware line, varies
greatly during a year's time. A price
which" may be perfectly fair now may be
very much too high or too low in six
i months from now, according to the chang
j ing conditions of the market. The result
is that dealers, in order to protect them
selves from loss, are compelled to bid
higher prices than the articles are worth
at that time, which is unfair to the city.'
Thirdâ uncertainty of securing pay
ment for goods supplied. In the past mer
chants have in several Instances lost
heavllv on the city because orders were
given for which no funds were available.
At other times payment has been unduly
withheld for trifling errors or apparent
difference in prices. Merchants know of
these facts but do not always understand
the reasons and cannot afford to give suf
ficient time to watching the state of the
treasury or the technical question in
volved. Hence many merchants refrain
entirely- from competing for any business
done with the municipality, while if the
ordering for the city were properly done
the city should enjoy the .best of credit
and command the lowest prices. - 7 ,7- ;

Fourthâ There will always be some arti
cles quired from time to time which are
not included in any schedule which can be
made for a year's supplies. Purchasing
these in open market, as is done at pres
ent, leads to charges of favoritism upon
the part of the party doing the purchas
ing.
We find that on account of the above
reasons many of the leading hardware
houses have declined in the past to bid
for these supplies and they emphatically
state that they will not bid in the future
under such .conditions.
We submit to your honorable board that
such a feeling should not exist. The pur
chasing of supplies is a purely business
proposition and should be conducted in a
business-like manner. The present offi
cers of the city government were pledged
by the different parties at the last elec
tion to conduct their departments in an
economical and business-like mariner, and
our recommendations are solely to enable
them to do so. ';-_'.
In view of the conditions enumerated

MERCHANTS" ASSOCIATION.
As a plan to be followed hereafter
the .association submitted the .follow*
ing: | -ff
Firstâ attempting to make an v enor
mous schedule containing all supplies
needed during an entire year and- Jixing
no Quantities the heads of each depart
ment should once a month prepare a
requisition of the supplies which will be
required by that department during the;
next ensuing month. These .requisitions
to have the different articles divided Into
classes so that each bidder need consult
only the class containing the goods in
which he deals. Exact quantity desired
for that month of each article should be
stated. These requisitions should be sub
mitted to the chief engineer for approval,
after making such changes as to quan
tity, etc., as in his judgment seems best,
and refer them to the Fire Department
Committee of the Board of Supervisors
for approval.
Typewritten or printed copies
of those lists in the form of proposals
should be sent to all. or at least not less
than three responsible firms carrying
stock of such articles, inviting them to
submit bids on a certain date. If it I*
made the rule and is known that tnese
list* will be sent out on a certain day in
each month and a copy is posted on tha
Official bulletin board every dealer in
town can. if he desires, ascertain what
supplies are wanted and procure a copy
of the proposal from the clerk in case
one has not been sent to him.
Thirdâ These bids should be received
only from legitimate licensed firms car
rying stock of the supplies desired, as
provided in present specifications. Bro
kers who simply bid on contracts and de
pend upon purchasing supplies from
wholesale houses as they are required,
should not be permitted to bid.
Fourthâ bids should be opened on a
fixed day in the presence of all bidders
who may attend by the Fire Department
Committee, who will award the order for
each item to the lowest bidder.
The advantages of this method are:
Firstâ Oniv one month's supplies being
required, except in the case of small arti
cles rarely used, the heads of depart
ments can easily and closely estimate the
ouanl ities required.
Secondâ Bidders, knowing the quantity
and that [1 is to be furnished within
thirty days or at once, can bid intelli
gently and at the lowest market prices.
Thirdâ lt will be necessary for dealers
to inform themselves concerning the con
dition of the funds only when bidding.
Fourthâ ln cases of emergency, or If
during the month some articles are re
quired which were not in the monthly re
quisition, a special list of these can be
gent at any time to not less than three
leading houses, and such order given to
the lowest bidder, and thus avoid exces
sive prices, charges' of favoritism, and
pressure for patronage, as is frequently
the case when goods are bought In open
market from some house especially desig
nated for this purpose. -. " : â¢'-.â¢
Fifthâ Such a method will save the un
necessary expense of . advertising the
award of contract for each of over 700
articles, many ok which are used in small
quantities and perhaps only two or three
times during the year. '._-â  -->
Furthermore, in support of these
recommendations we beg to report that
we have discussed this entire matter with
members of the leading wholesale hard
ware houses in this city, and they unani
mously approve this proposed method of
furnishing supplies, and state that If the
city will adopt such a system they will
regularly bid on the monthly supplies and
will guarantee the city fair prices. â 
Consequently we strongly recommend
that the system herein outlined be adopt

Oakland Offlce San Francisco Call, i
908 Broadway, July 22.
Where ls E. Black Ryan? What bu
happened that Is keeping him from the
Alameda County Board of Equalization?
Inquiry has been made, and it was
learned that he ls not sick, and that he is
in San Francisco attending to his duties
as tax agent for the Southern Pacifio
Company, but he has shown no inclination
to come to Oakland to fight Mr. Dalton,
as ... yore, nor has he sent any intimation
Of whether he will come or not, an.i Mon
day will i,,. the last day the board can sit.
It Is very unlike the railroad company
to submit to taxation of any kind without
protest unless it realizes that there is
nothing to be gained by protesting. Hith
erto It ha gained largely by making pro
tests in Alameda County, always being
able to convince at least three out of nvu
Supervisors.
Mr. Dalton says he has assessed the
property the same as in former years. His
enemies" say ho has made large cuts and
has not seen ma improvements which
the company has made. This Mr. Dalton
denies, but it is a fact I hat in two in- ;
stances there have been material reduc- j
tions. Mr. Dalton's explanation of these
reductions was made in this morning's
Call. It may be that with these reduc
tions the railroad company is satisfied,
and that it will not give the equalizers
any further trouble, all of which is very
strange to people cognizant of the Inner
workings of the railroad company and of
Alameda County politics.
All morning the Supervisors sat sullenly
awaiting the arrival of th.- little man who i
can smile away a big assessment more
sweetly than any other man on earth, but
he came not, and all the county is won
dering why.
District Attorney Allen advised the
board that the weight of legal authorities
seemed to hold that the assessment of
bonds of railroad corporations and quasi
public corporations is valid. Attorn
John Yule and George Reed protested
against the assessment of bonds held by
banks; but by unanimous vote the assess
ments were "upheld.
Th.- Havwards electric road asked for
a reduction of $76,000; but this was denied,
although its ires were reduced $45,000,
the same as last year.
M. G. C. Myer of Alameda asked for a
reduction on six acres of land from J5575
t*> 54125. It transpired that Myer was re
ceiving a revenue from his property equal j
to S per cent of its assessed value, and his J
motion was denied.
Mrs S. T. Yale has a house insured for
fIOOO. It is assessed for -â  -Â and the Su
pervisors agreed to reduce it to $390, Mr.
Wells alone voting no.
This concluded the business of the ses
sion, and as Mr. Ryan had not appeared
at 1 o'clock the board adjourned till Mon- ,
day morning^

OVER HUNDREDS
MISS JOSEPHINE PATTERSON, THE NEW CONTRALTO.
ALAMEDA, July Miss Josephine Patterson of this city has won the
coveted place of contralto soloist of Gilmore's military Land, in competition
with some of the greatest vocalists of New York City. She left Alameda last
autumn for the metropolis to complete her musical studies. Those who at
tended her farewell concert were thrilled by her astonishingly strong voice,
and predicted a great future for the local songstress.
There was a long list of applicants for the position which Miss Patterson
has won, most of whom were well-known New York vocalists. The hall ln
which the voices were tried has a seating capacity of 10,000 persons, and to sing
successfully there Is considered the most severe test to which the voice can be
put. Miss Patterson sang a selection in English, one in French and one in
Italian, and was engaged at once. E. A. Couteurier, the conductor of the
hand, stated that her first song won for her the prize. She will travel with the
organization throughout the United States, and will visit San Francisco in
February.

ALAMEDA, July 22.â After a vain
search from Colorado through Los An
geles to Alameda for a faithless lover,
Maud Fuller, penniless and without friends,
was forced to appeal to local charity to
assist her to get back to her hum*-- in Colo
rado Springs. Miss Fuller's story is the .
oft-told tale of the trusting maid and
olly-tongued scoundrel. Hack in her Col- â 
orado home six- met a young man who !
passed as Alvin Pratt. lie was an adept
at love making, and being what might be
termed handsome soon won the heart of
Miss Fuller. There was a promise of mar- j
riage, and the young girl, to her sorrow,
placed too mUc-h faith in her lover's pro
testations of everlasting affection.
Repeatedly she appealed to him to make
Rood his pledge and save her â  from dis- ,
grace, but he kept putting her off, until |
driven to desperation she confessed to her j
parents and begged them to avengo the
wrong that had been done her. An an
gry father went gunning for Pratt, but ;
the deceiver had flown. It was learned
that he had gone to Los Angeles.
Miss Fuller's parents sold their house
hold effects to provide her with funds to i
search for the man who had disgraced
her. She arrived in Los Angeles only to
find that Pratt had learned of her com- ,
Ing and had departed for Alameda. She ;
hastened on after him, reaching here ;
early last week. Being unable to locate
Pratt, she placed her case in the hands
of the local police and tearfully begged
them to make diligent search for the fel- <
low. Miss Fuller said her means were
exhausted and that she could continue the ;
chase no longer. She was taken in charge |
by Mrs. S. A. O'Neii of the Alameda â 
Charitable Association, who has since
cared for the unfortunate girl at her I
home, 2221 San Antonio avenue.
The police heard that Alvln Pratt had
been in Alameda and was here at the time
the girl arrived, but he managed to evade j
them, and his present whereabouts ls not
known.
To-day Mrs. O'Neii, on behalf of the
girl, asked the Supervisors to assist her j
to reach her parents. As a result she will '
go back to Colorado Tuesday.

Senor Sacury Sends a Dispatch That
I Exposes a Scheme to cause An
noyance to the Consul
General.
â¦
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 22.
A dispatch from Guatemala received in
Oakland to-day exposes a very clever plot
: that was prepared in San Francisco about
a week ago and which was intended to
disrupt the friendly relations between Fe
lipe Galixia, the Guatemalan Consul, Man
uel Morales Saenz and President Cabrera
of Guatemala.
â¢ A few days ago there appeared in several
| newspapers a statement saying thai Man
uel Saenz was to succeed Felipe Galixia
as Consul General owing to certain differ
ences existing between the Consul and the
â¢ Guatemalan administration. This infor
| mation was said to have been received
! "by private telegraphic advice," but it
is now said that no such advice was ever
received other than that put forward at
a little dinner at which the plot to annoy
Consul Galixia was hatched.
An interesting and somewhat romantic
story is behind the attempt of certain
Guatemalans in San Francisco to annoy
! the Consul General. Prominent among
! those who are not friendly to Galixia are
Antonio Barrios and Senor Castillo. These
j two men left Guatemala on account of
differences with their Government and the
dispatches stated that Castillo left dis
; guised as a woman. This story he has
since denied, but there are others who
vouch for its veracity. These men came
to San Francisco and were not received
by Consul Galixia with becoming dignity,
according to their ideas, and consequently
they were aggrieved. They made the ac
quaintance of the leading Spaniards in
San Francisco and Oakland society and
on one occasion were Invited by a promi
nent Spanish lady to lunch. Having ac
cepted previous Invitations it was readily
supposed they would accept another one.
But they sent no excuse nor did they ap
pear When asked later why such an in
sult had been administered they declared
that they bellved the' lady was a spy in
the interests of the Guatemalan Consul
General and that the lunches were part
of a plot to find out if they were schem
ing against the administration of Presi
dent Cabrera, which was responsible for
their leaving Guatemala
One afternoon there was a heated con
versation at the Occidental Hotel, in
which these Spaniards were told very
plainly that they were a long way from
being" gentlemen and men of honor, to
treat a lady in such a fashion after once
having broken bread In her house as
' 5 So me time later, it is now claimed by
the Consul's friends, a little dinner was
â¢ arranged at which some dissatisned Span
iards put up a scheme to annoy Consul
Galixia. Their alleged private advices
' were given to a Spanish newspaper man
I who translated them and' then supplied
the information to different newspapers.
It was to the effect that Consul Galixia
was to be removed ami that Senor Saenz
was shortly to leave Guatemala to repre
sent ihat republic In San Francisco.
Senor Saenz and Consul Galixia are
very warm friends and the Consul was
i Kreatlv surprised that President Cabrera,
Who appointed him. should have under
taken to remove him without notifying
him or giving him any suggestion that
any such humiliation was intended.
Senor Saenz, when the news was pub
lished, was on his way from New \ork
to Guatemala. Dispatches were sent,af
ter him asking him as to the truth of
the story. He at once replied that it was
absolutely false; that there was no inten
tion whatever on the part of President
Cabrera that Galixia should be removed,
as his consulate was giving entire satis
-1 faction to the Guatemalan Government.
This denial from Saenz was received to
day and in the meantime the rest of the
1 little scheme has been discovered.

Oakland Offlce San Francisco Call,
â¢ 908 Broadway,- .July 22.
The detectives are completely mystified
over a robbery of diamonds and jewelry
that was discovered last Sunday by Mrs.
B. G. Gordon, who resides at the Colusa
House,- 1010% Washington street.
The stolen jewelry includes one gold ring
Bel with five diamonds, one pair of gold
bracelets, one gold band ring, one pair of
gold ball earrings, one pair of gold sleeve
buttons, a pair of gold studs and some
smaller articles. The whole are valued at
not less than $1000.
There are many peculiar features con
nected with the robbery that lead Detect
ives Quiglev and Shorey to believe that It
is the work of some one who is well ac
quainted with the house and with the fur
niture in -Mrs. Gordon's room. Part of
the jewelry was taken from one bureau
drawer and part from another, and in
each Instance the cases were closed and
placed in their original positions, so that
the theft would not be detected until Mrs.
"dor w"Uld need her Jewels.
The theft was discovered last Sunday
morning an.l was at once reported to the
police Detectives Shorey and Quigley
were put to work on the case, but have
not vet discovered the slightest clew to
the robber. They are of the opinion that
the thief was a woman and certainly an
amateur This view of the case Is taken
because a pair of lady's gloves was stolen
and a pair of red leather slippers.
The Colusa is one of the most reputable
houses In Oakland. There is no transient
trade and nearly all the rooms are rented
to housekeepers. Mrs. Gordon and her
son have rented their present quarters for
a year and cannot think of any one who
would be likely to rob her. Her son is a
train .dispatcher at the pier. He discov
ered the robbery last Sunday morning
when he opened his dressing case to take
out a razor. He found that it was gone.
A general search was mad*- and then it
was discovered that jewelry had been tak
en from many cases.
The thief evidently was very discrimi
nating; everything that was gold or that
contained diamonds was taken, but a set
of solid silver souvenir spoons, several
pieces of solid silver plate and a valuable
revolver that was in the same drawer as
some of the jewelry were not disturbed.
Mrs. Gordon believes it must be the
work of some one whom she has received
in her rooms, but she has gone over the
list of her few friends with the detectives
and cannot derive any light from that
source as to the thief. â¢"â¢'-â  v b
It Is believed that the robber has also
operated recently in San Francisco, as the
police there are investigating a similar
case If a woman the detectives say that
they cannot see why she should steal a
razor, and If a man why he should steal
ladies' gloves and fancy slippers.

COMPLICATION OVER
TIDAL CANAL BRIDGES
OAKLAND, July 22.â letter was read
at the meeting of the Board of Super
visors to-day from Major Heuer of the
United States corps of engineers sta
tioned at San Francisco regarding the
construction of the projected bridge at
High street to span the tidal canal. The
major declares that not only must the
Federal Government keep all bridges
spanning the estuary in repair, but it
must build an additional bridge for high
way as well as for railway traffic at
Washington avenue.
"As I cannot build two combined
bridges starting from a common point
(Fernside station, on the south bank of
the canal)," says the letter, "without
great additional" expense, I request that
* â¢ â¢ you pass a resolution * * * to
the effect that in consideration of the
United States building a suitable and sat
isfactory bridge at Fruitvale avenue that
will accommodate all highway traffic at
that locality you waive the construction
of any bridges for highway traffic across
the canal other than that proposed at
Fruitvale avenue, between Park street
and High street bridges."
The letter was placed on file for future
consideration.

four* Chinamen working In the laundry j
house on the corner of Shattuck avenue

such practices as those commonly carried [
on at the Chinese wash-houses. Marshal '

cautioned the men about the habit, but
they have not heeded the warning. Last I

of the men in the laundry violating the I
ordinance, and - this afternoon placed '
them under arrest.

Bacon May Have Been Wading Out
to the Buried Bullion When He
Met His Death Eight Years
Ago.
' Oakland Oflice San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. July 22.
Lake Merritt is a veritable silver mine.
j The brick brought up by the dredger was
| cut in halves to-day, carefully assayed
I and found to contain thirty-eight pounds
I of silver, worth $275.
How the brick got into the lake is. of
course, a mystery. l ' is an ordinary silver
I bullion brick, on the bottom of which is
| th* brand. "J. L." The -action of the mud
' on the outside of th*- brick shows that it
had been in the lake a long time. The
contractor believes that at some time or
Other a robbery of bullion was committed
I and that it was thrown into the lake to
avoid detection and could not afterward
: be- located. He expects to find quite a
number of bricks, and after making a
chart showing the exact location where
the brick was found he moved the dredger
. away so that the treasure hunters would
not "know where to go hunting for silver
bricks.
Many years ago an employe of the Mint
lived in Oakland, on Tenth street, near
; Castro, and -when the house he occupied
: was pulled down long after his death
much gold and silver bullion was found
j buried beneath it. It is not at all unlikely
that the silver brick may have come from
the Mint and have been thrown into the
lake. It is certain that the brick was not
part of the outfit of the bogus Indian and
the gold brick men who manipulated their
i little game in the hills north of the lake,
I for they used brass bricks and in their
possession did not have a single silver
I brick.
About eight years ago a man named
Bacon was found dead in the mud of Lake
i Merrltt. No one knew how or why he got
! into the lake, but it is now supposed to be
likely that he was wading out to recover
some buried treasure and that the suction
of the mud drew him down and he was
drowned. It was said to be a case of
suicide, but there was no known reason
why he should have taken his life.
Ever since the Spanish occupation there
I have been weird stories told of buried
treasure in Lake Merritt. though just why
the Spaiards should always have been
anxious to bury treasure in every part of
the country has never been made plain.
Contractor Peterson is now analyzing
the mud he has pumped up during the
: past week to see if he can find any nug
gets, gold or silver slugs or any more
treasure. He has lost considerable money
so far on his contract to dredge the lake,
but ii he can discover a few bricks of
refined silver and perhaps one or two gold
ones he will come out more than even.
There has been much rivalry among
contractors to obtain the contract of
dredging the lake, and it is said that some
of the contractors who made bids were
aware that there was treasure buried in
the lake and this led them to make such a
bitter fight against Peterson, even after
i the contract had been awarded to him.

the market, though there may not be a
week from now. What do you think of
pineapple with cherries? Very good,
indeed, I assure you. Your pineapple
must be grated or choped fine, and the
cherries pitted. Then the pits are boil
ed in a very little water, and after they
have been strained out the sugar is put
Into this liquid to dissolve for the syrup.
There must be equal parts of the fruit.
and the white cherries must be used to
keep the preserve colorless. Allow half
a pound of sugar to a pound of th.*
fruit Into the syrup put the pineapple,
and let it boil until it is nearly clear.
Then add the cherries and boil until
quite clear, which will take usually
from six to eight minutes. Put up hot
in sealed jars as other preserves."

Judge Mogan Insists That a De
fendant Is Innocent Until
Proven Guilty.
J. Ohatterton, a teamster, appeared be
fore Judge Mogan yesterday to answer a
charge of having obscene pictures in his
possession and the Judge dismiss* th .
ca=:e on the ground thai the ordlnan* Â«_
under which the charge was made is un
constitutional.
Subdivision 5 of section 20, order 1597,
provides that the defendant must show
that he had the pictures in his possession
innocently or for a lawful purpose, throw
ing the onus of proof upon him and be
ing directly opposed to the dictum of the
constitution that a man is presumed to
be innocent until he is proved .guilty.'
"Th* same objection," said the Judge,
"applies to the ordinance regarding lot
tery tickets, and I have instructed Prose
cuting Attorney Joachimsen to bring the
matter to the attention of the Board of
Supervisors so that the ordinances pay be
amended to conform with the law."

I The field officials of Union Coursing
Park accomplished a remarkable feat
yesterday. They decided sevehty^one
courses in two hours and thirty-five min
utes during tho morning. They then
.-lowed down and ran off forty-four
courses during the' afternoon. Either
number represents a big day's work. At
one time during the morning there were
eleven braces of dogs in the held. Usually
the digs are not slipped until the field is
cleared.
The upsets in form were not numerous.

up. St. Anthony won, but was drawn in
the succeeding round. Rona and Rowdy

NEW YORK. July 22.â A special to
the Press from Omaha says: Cham
pion Jeffries to-day said that his fight
with Tom Sharkey would come off in
New York.
"I .j. .'â  care about these $00,000 \
offers, he said. "1 want reputation
and money and a fair iha rice. I've
seen some places where I could get
some of these, but I can get all of them
m New York. Of course, being a West
erner, I like the West, but when it !
comes right down to business no other
place is In it with New York. I' >s
oh the level and you always know that
it does a thi.ig big. Besides, when you
lick a man (here you lick him all over
the earth. Everybody knows about it
ami there isn't any yawping and there
isn't any suspicions. It's got to be on
the level there and you get spot cash, ;
â¢md the whole of it. if you win."

MIKE DWYER COLLAPSES.
Famous Turfman Has Run the Course
of All Plungers.
NEW YORK. July 22. Mike Dwyer has '
collapsed. The spectacle of this man, only
a few years ago the greatest of American ,
plungers, so prostrated by such a petty
incident as the bidding up of one of his
horses that it was necessary to assist him
from the trackâ this was what spectators ;
at the Brighton Beach racecourse wit- I
nessed to-day. Broken In body and spirit,
the once famous plunger, who has run the
course of all plungers, collapsed com
pleted' and was assisted from tne track
by Al" Havman, his betting commissioner.
and Charlie White, the referee and trainer
of pugilists.

DOCTORS BRING SUIT
TO OBTAIN DIPLOMAS
Action That Will Determine the Con
stitutionality of an Idaho
Lav/.
BOISE, Idaho, July 22.- Dr. E. G. Brow
and Dr. L. F. Inmai of Lewis ton, through
their attorney, have instituted proceed
ings here for a review of the action of
the State Board of Medical Examiners In
refusing to grant em licenses to prac
tice, 1 .'.â  plaintiffs nave been practicing j
for years, but the college in the East
where they too their diplomas is not
recognized as a regular and qualified In- j
stitution, and the Urd therefore refused â 
them licenses. Two years ago these sam â¢ :
two doctor;, wore refused licenses and
went into court, demanding heir rights.
Tic- court then declared In their favor
and pronounced the iaw unconstitutional.
The law was re-enacted by the last Leg
islature.
The doctors in their petition for a re- j
view claim that at the time they began
practice in this State they complied with
every law in existence governing their
actions. Such compliance put them Into I
possession of certain vested rights which j
the State has not power to withdraw, nor
can it enact subsequent laws which will
deprive them of right! obtained under .â _ !
previous law. When the case comes ur
for hearing, it is said, sensational charges '
will be made -against the board, which
will come back by showing the character
of diplomas the two doctors, hold.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEWPORT, R. 1., July 22.â After a
night of expectancy among the yachts
men, it was announced by Oliver C. Ise
lin this morning that there would be
no race between the Columbia and the
Defender to-day. Th*- reason for the
j change in plan was not given. The
broken link of the main sheet blocks
lon the Defender was replaced this
morning, and Captain Rhodes .it 8
: o'clock announced that as far as he was
concerned the Defender was ready foi
i the race.
Mr. Duncan of the Defender called
I on Mr. Iselin aboard the Columbia, and
j after a consultation stated that they
j finally had decided to go outside for a
: little "scrap,", and while there would be
1 no formal race, they would start from
j the Brenton Reef lightship and run
j down on the Point Judith course If the
j conditions were favorable.
At 11:45 th - Columbia left her moor- â¢
: ings and stocks down the harbor under '
i mainsail, working topsail and jib. The ;
j Defender preceded the new boat about
i fifteen minutes and moved slowly down I
i under three lower sails, baby jib, top- !
| sail and club topsail. The wind was I
j light from the northwest, having I
shifted from the south-southeast. The J
! boats lost the breeze below Fort Adams j
for fully a half hour and drifted about
with sails tlajvping idly. The Defender
touched her bottom on the rocks off
the cemetery at Fort Adams and was |
aground for several minutes. Captain ;
j Rhodes ordered her jib topsail down .
and a naptha launch came alongside, i
j took a line and pulled the Defender off I
into deep water. The boat was not in
jured, apparently.
At 12:20 the breeze picked up a bit
and the tw * big yachts slipped along
i slow!..- toward Beaver Tails lights.
Then the wind came in fresh from the i
south. The Columbia; getting the shift |
j first, set her jib topsail and made good j
I speed out to Brentons Reef lightship, i
I The Defender followed the Columbia :
down past the lightship without mak- I
ing any attempt to cross the line or j
make the racing start until both boats i
were a half-mile beyond the lights. !
Then they came together and stood off j
in a southerly direction for a couple of
miles. Both tacked in shore and final -j :
ly me about, heading for Point Ju- , '
dith. Large jib topsails were set and ! '
the yachts reach over to the point ! '
with the Defender in the lead. The ; '
Columbia was towing a tender and car- !
ried a working topsail. Honors were i (
about even. i ,
At 2:20 the yachts came about ami ] (
headed back toward the lightship, then j 3
about four miles away. The easterly ! <
breeze was freshening and great speed j *
was made. The Columbia was to wind- ; i
ward, and when tin luffed up at i <
Brentons Reef she had worked out i I
ahead. They sailed the four miles in j -
about twenty minutes and came up to j '
their rings at 3:30. i

Proposition Made to the Colorado j
Smelter Men.
DENVER, July 22.â An attempt was j
made this morning to reopen the Globe
smelter, the old schedule of ten and i
twelve hours being maintained in all
departments and wages Increased 10 per
cent. Very few of the former employes
applied for work, the Smeltermen's Un
ion having voted to adhere to the eight
hour proposition. The State Board of
Arbitration Will endeavor to bring
about an agreement between the smel
termen and the managers of the trust
smelters. â  ,--â  '-f-ff-
A meeting was held this morning at
which both sides to the controversy
were represented. J. B. Grant, chair
man of the operating committee of the
Smelting Company, offered to give all
the information in his power, but could
not say that the company would abide
by the board's decision. Attorney Co
hen for the union promised to adhere to
the decision of the beard in all particu
lars. President Wright of the Smelter
men's Union was examined regarding

KAISER'S TELEGRAMS
CREATE A NICE BREEZE
Boasting That May Lead Up to an
Acute Conflict With the
Reichstag.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1.9-, by James Gor
don Bennett.
BERLIN, July 22.â When the Kaiser re
turns from his Norwegian journey he
will probably flnd a nice little storm brew-
Zing In the empire, due to his latest
achievement in the way of peremptory
telegrams. Most of his Majesty's gov
ernmental troubles come from either his
post-prandial oratory or the fatal fas
cination which the telegraph form pos
sesses for him. If Dr. yon Lucanus could
only manage to forget those useful but
dangerous sheets of paper when William
II starts on his journey the imperial
Chancellor's cares of office would prob
Smith, great keeper of wampum, San
Francisco; Josiah Sims, great repre
sentative, Nevada City; George W.
L,ovio, great representative. Redwood
City; C. F. Burgman, great representa
tive, San Francisco; P. L. Bliss, great
sannap, San Francisco; L. C. Benin,
great mishlnewa. San Francisco; P. S.
Seymour, great guard of the wigwam.
San Francisco; S. i. Richards, great
guard of the forest, Grass Valley.
Under the practice of an unwritten
law the second and third chiefs are
advanced; consequently E. B. Wilson
of Sacramento will become the next
great sachem, and F. !i. Brandon of
this city the great senior sagamore.
There will be a contest for the posi
tion of great jimior sagamore, as that
is the one that leads i.i the highest
oflice: but as yet no one has announced
himself publicly for tne place. The
greatest contest will be for the posi
tion of great chief of records. For
this place there are the following can
didates: B. F. Josselyn of Sotoyome
Tribe. San Francisco, past great sa
chem; Great Sannap Porter L. Bliss
of Modoc Tribe. San Francisco; Great
ably be diminished by half. The present
' storm has been caused by what is known
! as "the Hlnzpeter dispatch." a telegram
sent to a professor of that name, his for
mer tutor. His Majesty twelve months
ago declared in one of his after-dinner
oratorical efforts his intention of making
it a matter of penal servitude for any
"tic of his subjects tV* strike. In pursu
ance of this idea he caused the now noto
; rious "yuchthaus gesetz" to be Intro
duced in Parliament, when lt was prompt
ly rejected by an overwhelming majority.
This, however, only raised his Majesty's
lighting instincts, and he has now as
sured Professor Hlnzpeter that he pos
sesses the quite unbending will of his an
cestor, the great Elector, and thai noth
ing will turn him from his purpose, so
that an acute conflict with the Reichstag
is now in prospect.
Like the famous Krtgor and Schaum
berg-Lippe dispatches, this raised a -term
throughout the empire. The independent
press is showing all its Ingenuity in crit
icizing the Imperial utterances without
committing itself to the dread crime of
"les.: maj - c." The Berliner Tageblatl
has particularly distinguished Itself by
giving a list of monarens with "unbend
ing wills" who "came croppers" in conse
quence.
BONHAM SEEKS TO
ANNUL THE MARRIAGE
! Grows Weary of a Nuptial Knot Tied
on a Yacht Outside the
Heads.
SANTA ROSA. July 22.â "John P.
Bonham vs. Elizabeth McDonald,
known as Elizabeth Bonham â divorce."
This is the innocent-looking entry ap
pearing upon the civil register at the
office of the County Clerk here, but in
vestigation shows that back of that
every-day entry is a story of much
more than ordinary interest. An ex
amination of the complaint reveals the
fact that the case is not one In proceed
ings for divorce, but rather that It is
one seeking the annullmen! of a mar
riage contracted on board the pleasure
| yacht Hattie B on August 11, 1596.
While the waves dashed merrily off
the heads of San Francisco Harbor
I Captain W. E. Gage of the Hattie B
' got out his little book and spliced the
j couple hard and fast, but the voyage
I begun so gayly baa ended in disaster.
Th* seas of matrimony proved rough
sailing, and now young Bonham would
have things back the same old way. As
a reason for asking that his marriage
be annulled, the plaintiff alleged that
when he and Elizabeth McDonald were
wed the latter was a minor and scarce
ly 16 years of age. He also alleges that
! such a marriage Is contrary to the pro
visions laid down in the Civil Code of
the State, and that the voyage outside
the heads was undertaken for the pur
pose of evading the statutes providing
the manner in which marriages may
be contracted and solemnized.
Elizabeth McDonald, or Elizabeth
I Bonham, whichever the courts may de
| cide her name to be, Is the daughter of
I Angus McDonald of San Francisco.
Prophet and Great Representative
and Past Great Sachem F. A. Whipple
of Sani Tribe, Fort Bragg; Great
Guard of the Wigwam P. S. Seymour
of Osceola Tribe, San Francisco, and
Deputy Great Sachem F. B. Swan of
Osceola Tribe.
This term the Great Council will
elect an additional representative, so
that it will choose two Instead of one
as in the past. One of these chiefs
will be the outgoing great sachem, and
it is possible that the honor of being
the second will be conferred on Wil
liam J. Smith, the great keeper of
wampum.
During the session of the Great
Council there will be a contest for a
prize of $100 for the best rendition of
the warrior's degree work, and the
tribes that are to contest nre Modoc.
Osceola, White Eagle. Bald Eagle,
Altahmos and Monadnock.
A prize of HOO offered to the tribe
making th*- greatest showing of adop
tion of palefaces during the great sun
will be awarded to Altahmos Tribe, it
having had 136 adoptions.
The Degree of Pocahontas has in this
! Bonham is a resident of this city and
, resided in a cozy cottage in Pippers'
'â â  Addition. Ever since the wedding the
i couple have been living together as
man and wife, and in his prayer ask
ing that his pretended marriage be de
\ clared illegal the plaintiff asks that he
i be given the custody of a bright-eyed
youngster who arrived about a year
and a half ago at the Ron ham house

LEDERER'S WIFE TELLS
OF HIS BRUTAL ATTACK
Insanity Will Be the Plea of the
Would-Be Murderer When
He Is Tried.
WOODLAND. July 22.â Mrs. I.corn
has so far recovered from the effects of
| the brutal attack by her husband, the
1 knife wielder, thai the attending physi
, cian consented that she make a state
( ment to the District Attorney. Her btory
! differs materially from the statements
heretofore published. The stabbing oc
* curred in the kitchen. The woman was
, washing the dishes when her husband
â¢ unexpectedly came in and began up
braiding her for an alleged attempt to get
away with his property. While she was
lining Lederer suddenly drew the
butcher knife from his clothing, - Ized
Mrs. Lederer and began slashing her
body.
The screams of Mrs. Lederer for help
brought her little daughter in from the
1 yard. Lederer turned his attention to the
little girl and made a desperate attempt
to kill her. While he was chasing her
around a wheal pile In the corral the
j mother made her escape into the field
and fell fainting from loss of blood,
where she was afterward found.
Young Fred Lederer explained to the
District Attorney all about bis father's
I incarceration in an asylum for th? insane
|in Germany. Lederer was not regarded
: as actually insane. He was squandering
! an estate and was arrested upon a charge
!of Incompetency. He was confined in the
asylum while the matter was heard. After
1 the appointment of a guardian he was
immediately released and soon afterward
left for the United States.
The next move will be to procure the
proper affidavits, after which District At
torney Bush will charge Lederer with as
sault with a deadly weapon with intent
1 to commit murder. Arthur W. North will
be Lederer's attorney, and a plea of in
, sanity will be the defense
,

to-day. F. A. Joseph and F. C. Hood of
Detroit lowered the world's amateur two

treasuries of the various councils an
aggregate of $1500, and its assets
amount to $4000. This order was insti
tuted at Philadelphia in 1887, and has
now a membership in the Union of 35,

Freedom, friendship and charity.
The present chiefs are: Hattie
Whipple, great Pocahontas: Annie E.
Bishop, great Wenonah; Mrs. E. J.

A. E. Gill, great keeper of wampum;
Louisa Bran, great Minnehaha; Fannie

ent great Wenonah, Annie E. Bishop,
will at the coming session be promoted
great Pocahontas. She has been a
member of the degree for six years,
and through her energy has advanced
to the fore rank. Her membership in
the order gave her the opportunity to
bring out latent dramatic power that
she possessed, as she had occasions
numerous to give evidence of her
powers of elocution. She is now a
member of the Vroom-Addison com

name of Miss Leona Leigh.

JOHNSTON'S ESTATE
IN A LEGAL TANGLE
Canadian and American Administra
tors Both Claim the Right
to Act.
SAN JOSE* July 22. Some interest
ing complications are promised in the
estate of Samuel Johnston, who died
while an Inmate of Agnews Asylum,
on December 20, 1897. A few months
previous Johnston came here from
British Columbia. He left an estate
valued at $7100. M".-i of this money
lies In British Columbia banks as fol
lows: British Columbia and Invest
ment Company, Victoria, $2326; Bank
of Montreal. Victoria. $1563; Bank of
British Columbia $1000: Bank of Brit
ish North America. $2050.
Johnston's only heir is a sister. Sarah
Buck, residing in Ontario. Letters of
administration have been granted to
Public Administrator Kell. Now comes
the information that the British Co
lumbia officials also are administering
upon Johnston's estate as regards the
deposits in Canadian banks. Just
which administrator will gel the hand
ling of the money is a question that at
torneys will eagerly watch. Anyhow,
the estate will be obliged to pay th -
charges of both administrators. It i-â¢
not known that such complication hi :
ever arisen before. It is said the only
emergency through which the estate
might lose money would be on a break
ing out of war between the two coun
tries, in which case this and other
American money would be confiscated.
RECOVERED TAX MONEY.
SACRAMENTO. July 22.-Judge John
son to-day rendered a decision in favor

property taxes which it had paid under
protest. It was contended by the bank
that It was exempt under its charter from
that character of taxation. In the light
of a recent decision by the Supreme Court
Judge Johnson rendered judgment in fa
vor of the bank, which will now get its
money back.

ONE MINERS LUCK.
After Hope Had Left Him Ha
Stumbled Over a Nugget Worth
About $8000.
This man had reached the very last of
his resources without linding a speck of
gold and although men in such extremity
are.always kind and helpful to each other.
he could not expect any one to share his
fast-dwindling stores with him. There
was nothing for it, therefore, but to turn
back on the morrow, while a mouthful of
food was still left, and to retrace his steps
as best he might to the nearest port, lie
dwelt with a good deal of rough pathos
on the despair of that last day's trust
less work, which left him too weak and
exhausted to carry his heavy tools back
to the- spot they called "camp." So he
just flung them down and, as he said,
"staggered" over the two or three miles
of scrub-covered desert, guided by the
i smoke of the eampflre. Next morning
early, after a great deal of sleep and very
little food, he braced himself up tc (go
back and fetch his tools, though he care
fully explained that he would not have
taken the trouble to do this if he had not
felt that his pick and barrow were about
his only possessions, and might fetch the
price of a meal or two when it came to
the last. j ._, â 
I have often wondered since If the im
pression of the Divine mercy and good
ness which was so strong in that man's
mind just then has ever worn off. Ha
dwelt with self-accusing horror on how
he had railed at his luck, at fate, at
everything, as he stumbled back that hot
morning over his tracks of the day be
fore. The way seemed twice as long. for,
as he said, his "heart was too heavy to
carry." At last he saw his barrow and
pick standing up on the flat plain a little
way off. and was wearily dragging on
toward them, when he caught his toe
against a stone deeply Imbedded in the
sand, and fell down. His voice sank to a
sort of awestruck whisper, as if he w*rÂ»
almost at confession, as he said:
"Well, ma'hm, if you'd believe me. I
cursed awful. I felt as if it was too hard
altogether to bear. To think that I should
go and nearly break my toe against the
only stone in the district, and with all
those miles to travel back! So I lay there
like Job's friend and cursed God and
wanted to die. After a bit I felt like a
passionate child who kicks and breaks
the thing which has hurt him, and I had
to beat that stone before I could feel
quiet. But it was too firm in the sand
for my hands to get it up. so In my rage
I set out briskly with the pick to break
up that stone, if it took all my strength.
It was pretty deep set in the ground. I
assure you. ma'am, but at last I got lt
up, and here it isâ solid gold and nearly
as big as a baby's head. Now. ma'am, I
ask you, did I deserve this "
He almost banged the rather dirty-look
ing lump down on the table before me as
he spoke, and it certainly was a wonderful
sight, and a still more wonderful weight.
He told me he had searched about the
neighborhood of that nugget all day, but
there was not the faintest trace of any
more cold. So. as he had no time to lose
on account of the shortness of the food
and water supply, he just started back
to the coast, which he reached quite
safely and came down to Perth in the
flrst steamer. The principal 'bank had
advanced him Â£800 on his nugget, but it
would probably prove to be worth twice
as much. I asked him what he was going
to do. and was sorry to hear that he in
tended to go back to England at once and
set up a shop or a farmâ l forget whichâ
among his own people. Of course, it was
not for me to dissuade him, but I felt
it was a pity to lose such a good sort of
man out of the colony, for he was not
spending his money in champagne and
card-playing, as all the very few success
ful gold finders did in those flrst days.â

London's Meat.
Little more than a half of the bill that
London settles every year goes Into thÂ«
pocket of the English farmer. Prom the
ends of the earth comes this vast supply.
This great ogre of a city of ours, before
whose gastronomic efforts the feats of all
the giants of legend and fairy tale fade
into insignificance, has taken his toll of
the wild ranchers from boundless Western
prairies, of the beautiful chestnut colored
herds of the Andalusian Mountains, of
the piebald coated cattle that the honest
Dutch tend as their own children, and of
the sturdy oxen of the North German
plains. Canada and Australia send us
lambs and sheep, the River Platte our ox
tongues. Hamburg and Rotterdam our
pigs. What an advertisement for tha
Navy League! What an object lesson for
those who declare our fleet is overgrown!
It passes human comprehension to think
what would become of London if our com
mand of the sea were lost and the foreign
supplies failed! If the 150.000 live cattle
from America that swell the metropoli
tan cattle herd during the year never
reached their destination; if Holland's
half million of sheep were forced to re
main on the home pasturesâ in short, if
the 140,000 tons of meat, neither bred nor
fed in these islands, that London annually
consumes, ceased to appear in the butch
ers' shops in the metropolis.â Cassell's

EASTERN MARKETS,
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, July 22.â T0-day's stock mar- I
ket was an unimportant, even an Insignifi
cant affair. I^ondon manifested some contln- :
ued interest In American securities, irking
up prices rather above the point reached on {
this side even on the opening rise. The open- |
Ing advance here finally succumbed to the j
sympathetic Influence of a reaction in Sugar,
which lost over a point. Heaviness in other j
Industrials helped to hold back the market.
The bears were no more disposed to operate
than the bulls. The bank statement brought a ;
realizing movement which carried prices off
ln pome cases a point from the best. Rock
Island and a few- other stocks which have been
going up for several days being most affected.
The offerings were well absorbed and the short i
session ended with quotations not far from
last nighfs prices. The oppressive heat pre
vailing had something to do with the extreme
lassitude cf the trading. Fort Worth and Den
ver Citj' first mortgage bonds rose 1% on the
acquirement of traffic rights between Denver
and Pueblo by the Colorado and Southern,
which controls the roed.
Net changes ln prices of stocks for the week
are mostly small and showed both gains and
losses. There were some sharp losses in the
early rart of the week and the movement
after that was irregular. It was the smallest
week's business of the year. Even dealings
by professional operators had dropped to a
minimum- Lovking back over a period of a
month lt Is taX*-' to discern that the best judges
failed to correctlj- estimate the world's needs
for money, nnd the release of large sums
which Â«as confident! j- expected after Julj- 1 has |
been successively delayed from daj' to day an.l
from week to week. Large loans were repaid
to the Bank of England in the first days of
Julj', but before the week was over the mar
ket was again a borrower from ' - - bank and
has been ever since at ratÂ«-s up to 44 per cent.
as against th.c bank's ortlcisU minimum of 34 ,
per cent. Onlj- In the last three days has there
been anj" remarkable relaxation In money
ptringencj' at the British capital. It has been
obvious as the situation developed that Lon
don and the Continent wer. going to be more
dependent on the United States for r?lief than
was contemplated and the continued hardness
of monej- here has aroused doubts as to the
avail.-i'ilitj- of that relief. The situation is
conclusive evidence of the continued strong
Influence of America In the money markets of
the world. The Industrial activitj' In Ger
many, especially in iron and steel, and th"
speculation of the Berlin bourse have -*.;â :
monej- hi^h at Berlin. In GrÂ«-at Britain itself
there has b-en expanding trade and Interior
demand for monej- beyond what has been j
counted upon, and the call of a portion of the
Japanese loan pinched the London market. In
the face of these conditions, when London saw ,
the monej- rate In New York holding high and
very slow to yield, the speculation in securi
ties came to a standstill, not onlj- in London
but on the Continent and In New York.
The street railway strikers in Brooklyn and I
Manhattan boroughs of New York aroused \
seme anxletj' as a possible sj-mptom of gen- i
eral unrest among wage earners. This has
been an Important factor in discouraging act
ive operations In the stock market while so â¢
manj' favorable conditions seem.d to presage
a rise In prices.
Dealings in bonds have been dull and .om.
Issues :ell au_y ln price, but other moved up- !
ward on active demand. United States regis
tered 3s and 5s advanced 4, the old 4s reg

NEW YORK'S FINANCIAL CONDITION.
NEW YORK, July 22.â Financier saj'S
this week:
i The reduction of 000,000 In the deposits of
i the New York banks last week tightened re
. serve requirements about $3,000,000. The Insti
. tutlons, however, according to their current
i statement, lost $1,164,100 cash, and for this rea
! son the increase in surplus reserve was only
J1,356,550, which brines present holdings $12,
--* 055,600 above legal requirements. The decrease
'. in loans have contracted outstanding Pan obli
; gations no less than $28,000,000. In the same
time deposits have b--en decreased nearly $27.
--i 500,000 while the cash in bank has remained
' stationary. It will be seen that reserves have
i been strengthened at the expense of outstand
! ing commitments, and tho process does not ap
' pear to have reached an end as yet. There is
! no question, however, that th* banks are now
' gaining cash, even if the statement does Indi-
c ate otherwise. The known operations -' money
! last week were decidedly In favor of the instl
-1 tutlons. the loss of $75'\000 to the treasury hav
ling be'Â«n offset by the gain of something like
$2,000,000 in the interior. The current exhibit
\ does not reflect this, but It ls to be said that
â¢ the losses shown can 1..- traced to two or three
' large banks, the remaining members having
; really strengthened their positions. As to the
. outlook, the opinion is that there is nothing In
' the situation at present to warrant an undue
expansion In bank figures. The . liquidation
which began with July has run Its course to a
j large extent, and while the present Is a mid
season period the movement of money will
! probably continue this way for some little time.
; Foreign exchange authorities agree that gold
I exports except as special transactions are at
; an end. and while the crop season is near at
hand It Is not anticipated that the demands
this year will cause much of a drain from New
Ycrk Interior bank reserves are above the
! avenge an.l this, coupled with easier rates
for money abroad and the certainty that ex
; change will rule in favor of New York With
the :,-.:ng grain exports, sterns to favor a re
', taxation rather than a. rise in rates here ror
; the time being.

ent state. September began at an advance of
lc, with the bulk of trading at 70% c. A fur
ther advance was scored Immediately to 71S4c
A cool wave was sighted by the leather pro

reports of damages from rains ln parts of the j '
WeFt and Southwest. The seaboard reported a' 1
good export business. Selling against calls and ; 'â 
official predictions that the cool wave would j .
move southward soon checked the rise.
Shorts recovered from their fright and resum- , ;
el selling with such success that at the end I .
of the short session %c had been clipped off
the September price. September closed at *04
Â®70 ic, a net gain of %c.
Corn opened strong In sympathy with wheat. j
Reports were uniformly favorable for crop i
prospects. September closed unchanged.
Oats ruled dull and easy, closing unchanged.
Provisions opened strong, with hogs 10c up. I
The weakness which later developed in corn
was communicated to provisions and the early
strength was dissipated. September pork â  :
closed unchanged, and lard and ribs closed
steady at about yesterday's closing prices.

DRIED FRUITS, NUTS AND RAISINS,
There seems to be some confusion as to the
situation In Prunes. A wire from New York
reports Visalia Prunes offering there at 2%c
for the four sizes, while In the Santa Clara
Valley the driers are bidding $30 for the raw
fruit; which Is equivalent to *4<" for the dried j
product. The large size of the fruit this year
may account for this apparent discrepancy, but
the gap between the two figures Is wide, to say
the least. Possibly there is a mistake some-
The only change In quotations is a decline
in Evaporated Apples, which are expected to go I
still lower- on account of the size of the crop. ,
Honey is" Arm at a slight advance.

A Suggestion That the Second Bri
gade Turn Out to Receive the
Fighting California
Volunteers.
â â¦
There Is some complaint that â¦'" orders
from headtjiiart ersâ that Is, the general
licrs â are very, very slow, and that of
od deal of.inforn.ation that would be of j
crest to guardsmen Is given out so that j
the time it reaches those entitled to ]
:e ive the same it is like ancient history,
is claimed that an effort is being made
superior headquarters Jo pattern after
i United States army headquarters, but
ise who Icnow the workings of both of
?s say that, the patterning Is after, but
ong way after, the regular my. They
.o say that promptness in all matters
inected with the guard is another of
ise matters that the adjutant general
11 have' to take lessons in.
n 1595 there was passed a law which
I â¢ _3"4des that "there shall be a board of
ree officers; to be detailed by the com
mder-in-chief, which board shall meet
im time to time, but at least once a
ar. for the purpose of considering Mild
â ommending to the con.mander-in-ehief
iat; ih their judgment) is most urgently I
luired for uniforming and equipping th- !
ard from time to timel',-' l'nder that act J
> then commander-in-chief on -â¢ item- |
./-_. detailed Colonel Currier; of the di
:ion staff. Colonel Fairbanks of the
fth Infantry and Colonel Nuhan of the
;th Infantry. This board organized, held
-etings. and presented a report on the
ii of that month; but it is said that
such a board no longer exists, for all the
officers are but of the guard, two of them
for a considerable length, of tune. None
<*f the officers of the guard in this city
have any recollection of any order dis
solving that board and appointing another
to take its place, and there are none who ;
can call to mind any meeting in a year
past h.-ld for the purpose of recommend
ing what, in their judgment; is most ur
gently required. There are a number of
guardsmen who want to know if the j
board, like many other things in the j
guard, lias simply been dropped.
Jt was suggested to some of the com
manding officers of companies of ihe Sec-;
ond Brigade that the companies ought to
bo ordered out to receive the First Cali
fornia upon its return from Manila, as
the lighting regiment is part of the bri
gade. Those who were spoken to favored
the suggestion, but declared that they
have not the means to meet the expense
of transportation and subsistence while on
that duty. The matter has been called to
the attention of Brigadier General War
field of that brigade, and he stated that
he would give the subject consideration;
3t is possible that some means may be
found to bring the men irom San Jose,
Santa Rosa. San Rafael. Petaluma and
other points to take part in tne big pa
rade.
The Signal Cor; of the Second Brigade
has decided to discaru the yellow trim
mings heretofore worn and auo-.t the
same trimmings worn by that branch of j
The service in the United Stat* army,
which is black. An order for the change :
has been Issue**.
At a recent meetine- of tl.*> Signal Corps
in the armory on Ellis street the mem
bers were visited by Sergeants Jurs and j
Knapp of the First Company. United
States Volunteer Signal Corps, who re
turned with the Oregonians. Both were |
members of the local corps at the time i
sif enlistment, and th* make four of the |
five who enlisted from the corps and have :
returned to this city. The fifth. Emmett
Jones, was at last accounts till at the
Philippines. Some time during the week
the two returned volunteers will be ten- I
dered a reception at the armory. Ser- j
geant .lurs was the engineer of the" famous
tlnclad steamer Laguna de Bai, which i
Was such a terror to the Filipinos.
There has been a cleaning up of the j
Tolls of the several companies of the Fifth
Infantry; and as a result tifty-eight men !
Jiave been discharged from the service for
various causes.

PAST FOURTEEN YEARS.

Work of the St. Vincent de Paul So- !
ciety to Be Reviewed at a
Conference To-Day.
For fourteen years the society of St.
j Vincent de Paul of this city has relieved
the necessities of the needy Catholic pa
rishioners of San Francisco. In that time
the sum of at least $100,000 has beert dis

day the society will hold its quarterly
meeting in the Catholic Orphan Asylum
at San Rafael.
By special dispensation of the spiritual
director of the organization, Very Rev. J.
J. Prendergast, the members attending
the meeting will be privileged to receive
holy communion in their parish churches
in place of having to approach the secra
ment of the eucharist in a body at one
church, which is the usual rule of the so
ciety.
The Archbishop will he present at the
quarterly conference. Reports will be read
from thirteen branch conferences show

parochial charity.
This organization has many thousands
of branches all over the world, and is the

BARLEY FOR EUROPE.
Continental Malsters Looking to This
State for Their Supplies.
A recent letter received by- J. A. Filcher ,
1 of the State Board of Trade leads to the j
j belief that the time is not far off when
.the maltsters of Europe will be calling
j upon 'he growers of this State fur a part :
j of the barley necessary for their Conti
l nental business. As shown by reports
j from various parts or the world, the
j cereal crops have failed or are not up to I
I the average.
In the past but little barley has been
purchased here by the European jobbers,
i hut the short crops of Russia. Australia, .
â  Canada, etc.. have made It necessary to I
! look in all directions for this cereal. The |
letter referred to comes from C. J. Mur
phy, one of the Commissioners represent
ing the United States in Europe, who is !
looking after the food product interests
of this country for the Government. He
writes front Brussels, stating that several
: of the big maltsters of that country have
requested him to furnish them with the
names of some of the large shippers and
dealers in barley in California. Their
object is to negotiate for a considerable
portion of the Pacific Coast crop. The i
i desired information was given by Mr.
i Filcher.
ALMSHOUSE REPORT.
Pacts About Wenders Over the Hills
to the Poorhouse.
The superintendent of the Almshouse
has prepared an interesting report setting j
forth the history of the institution for the
fiscal year ended July 1, which will be
read at the next meeting of the Board of
Health.
It appears therefrom that during the
year 598 persons have wended their way to
the municipal home for the neglected and
Impecunious. Of this . number . rÂ»S were
males and 100 females. There were 990. in
mates in the institution on July 1, 1898,
so that the total number to be accounted
for for the present year is 15SS. Three
hundred and thirty-nine inmates were dis
charged at their own request during the
year, S3 ran away without permission, 67
were discharged for declining to perform
their share of the work allotted to in
mates and 139 died during the twelve
months. This left 960 inmates in the
Almshouse at the finish of the fiscal year.
The appropriation for the year was $95,- !
550, am! the expenditures $94,608 19, leav
ing a balance on hand of $941 Sl. Thirty
three people are employed on salaries
averaging $1815 per month. The total num
ber of officers, employes and inmates on a
daily average was 1014, and the cost of
maintenance daily was 10 19-100 centsâ not
an extravagant amount for three meals a
day.
Among- the loading expenditures for the
year were the following sums: For sala
ries $21,213 40; for provisions, $37,739 39; for
dry goods and clothinp. $33,446 6S: for to
bacco. $956 55: for medicines, $1884 41; for

The Railroad Loses.
In 1.93 the Sierra Ice Company had sev

were insured in \he Liverpool & London
& Globe Insurance Company for $21,000.
Three of them were burned and the com- *
panv paid the amount of insurance there
on, amounting, to $15,000. The cause of the .
live was sparks from one of the loco- I
motives of the Southern Pacific Company,
which had a spur track to the ice com
pany's piaj^t. The insurance people sued 1
the railroad for the amount of the insur
ance paid, setting up that the company
was to blame fcr setting the fire by the
means of a defective smoke consumer or
arrester on the engine, which started the
blaze, In the lower court the insurance
people won and the case was appealed to
the Supreme Court, where the decision

First Woman to
Walk Through
the Sowers
of San Francisco.
WHO has not read Victor Hugo's
"Les Miserables," and, having
read it. who can ever forget the
picture of Jean Valjean stum
blinig through the sewers of
Paris under the weight of the body of
Marlus?
The sewers of Paris were high ar.d wide;
but the distance was lor.g, the windings
tortuous, a-nd brave Jean Valjean came
cut under the blue sky well nigh as life
less as the motionless human burden he
was carrying.
These many thousand miles away from
Paris through the sewers of San Francis
co stumbled a man weighted by the cling
ing form, of a slave girl. This modern
prototype of Jean Valjean was a China
man. The gir! was an unfortunate slave
â who thus escaped from a brothel in Chi
titown and through the sewers was car
;ie_, :. the mission, which shelters such
moon-fa I unfortunates.
A month later, in this same sewer, two
Chinese highbinders stowed selves
away while the police vainly sought them
in their usual haunts.
A.. 01 which reads stranger than the
fiction of Victor Hugo. The sewers of
Paris may be broader and higher but they
do not wind through a Chinatown. And
in ways dark and mysterious the heathen
Chinee has used the sewers of San Fran
cisco as the "sans culotte" never dreamed
of using the sewers of Paris.
Mr. Kenney is more at home in the
sewers than he is above ground. He gives
an address on California street, but dur
ing the day he can only be found In the
sewers. He has business there. The sew
ers are constantly in need of repairing.
For twenty j'ears and months to boot
Mr. Kenney has spent the better part of
his- days underground, repairing 'he sew
ers of San Francisco.
Strang- things happer. above ground in
San Francisco. Who will not bear wit
ness to this?

Stranger things happen underground.
P. Kenney will bear witness io this.
The strangest journey that a woman
can make is underground. I will bear
witness to this.
You may have sailed over the bay in
any or every craft that can plow ihe
water; you may have shot through the
clouds In a parachute; you may have
traveled over San Francisco in bob-tall
car or automobile; but I am the only
woman who ever walked underground in
San Francisco.
The Chinese girl was carried through.
- I took this journey for several reasons.
We are not accustomed to think of the
sewers of San Francisco as navigable
places. 1 ..ey are not. like t.ie sewers of
Paris, constructed for strolls, where
friends may promenade two or three
abreast. Workmen go down into them,
repair them and get out as ; quickly as
possible. That is all save Mr. Kenney.
I wanted to go Into the sewers with
Mr. Kenney and find out just how well
it pays him to forego the green earth for
the gray .ewers.
Then, too, while the Chinese slave girls
are constantly being rescued, but once in
the annals of the missions is it written
that the sewers were the avenue of es
cape, I wanted to see just how this was
accomplished. â â â¢"â .'â â '
The history of Chinatown is a history
of hatchet-men and highbinders. In the
Pacific-street sewer several highbinders
escaped the arm of justice. I wanted to
look upon the place which sheltered these
wily Mongolians from the police.
I saw al! these things and many more
besides.
â¢ â¢ â¢
It was Thursday afternoon, July â , by
the calendar and 4 o'clock by the cab
driver's timepiece. He pulled rein, by
order, at the corner of Pacific and Dupont
streets. I opened the door and jumped
out. Mr. Kenney was there before me.
SAN FRANCISCO
JULY-23-1899
Strand Things
Happen
Underground.
p â  iy HERE is a man in San Francisco who could release a pris
| oner from the Broadway Jail as easily as you or I could
crawl under a fence. He isn't the President of the United
States nor yet the Governor of California nor even the Mayor of
San Francisco. He has neither -'influence" nor "pull." Yet if he
chose to give a prisoner his freedom he could do it more easily
than any of these dignitaries. There would be no need of cutting
red tape, no necessity of petitions or pardons. He could do it with
out so much as a "by your leave" to any official in the land.
He would not be in the slightest danger of detection. Not
though they put the united police force of Christendom on the
case.
He hasn't a set of keys that will unlock strongest bolts or
bars. He need not carry knife or gun. Nor sharpest warden nor
shrewdest "trusty" would ever be aware that he was giving the
prisoner his liberty.
The man who is able to do this is neither a magician nor a
hypnotist. He is not a visionary who imagines that the power is
his. He is a plain, practical working man. Moreover, he has made
good his boast to Captain Spillane of the police force.
He has shown Captain Spillane just how he could release a
man from the Broadway Jail if he chose. He has proven that with
the use of his limbs and the aid of a lantern it would be an easy feat.
The man who possesses this extraordinary power is Patrick
Kenney. It is his neither by divine nor official right. It is the
power of knowledge a knowledge of the sewer system of San Fran
cisco.
There is not a twist nor a turn in the entire sewer system that
Patrick Kenney does not know of. There is a twist and. a turn in
the sewer leading to the Broadway Jail.
Patrick Kenney is the only human being in San Francisco
who could crawl from the main sewer into that leading directly into
the Broadway Jail. Patrick Kenney is the only human being who
could tell a prisoner, no matter where his cell was located, how to
join him in" a certain turn of the sewer and thence on to a manhole
and liberty.
Patrick Kenney could do this if he would. But the police need
not fear, the Broadway Jail prisoners need not hope. Patrick Ken
ney is a law-abiding, order-obeying citizen.
We walked toward the open manhole
"It's a girl and she's going down Into
the sewer," yelled a youngster on the
curbstone.
"Nit!" was the decisive denial of an
other tyke. "It's a boy!"
"Huh!" said the first. "Til bet it's a
girl; look at her hair!"
O, traitor locks, that despite careful ar
rangement had betrayed my sex!
The red flag fluttered from the open
manhole. A shaky looking ladder led to
darkness beneath. I looked at the dank
->..-,.--.,- Below, I looked at the blue sky
above, and I hesitated. Then I looked
at young America, brimful of youthful
jibe's. ready to ridicule me. I chose the
sewer, shut my eyes and followed Mr.
Kenney down the ladder.
The splashing of water against my roi -
ber boots and I knew that I stood in a
sewer. I suppose I had the seven senses
accredited to the normal human being, I
was conscious of but one â that of smell.
I felt nauseated; mv brain was reeling;
I felt mv feet slipping from under me.
"It's all imagination." said my guide.
"Now don't cut up any fainting capers
down here. I had the hole open for an
hour before you came and the air is all
rieht. You just imagine it."
Now, by all the saints, P. Kenney may
have been right. I had prepared to out
rage my nostrils, and had Mveen led into
a garden of roses that d_V ' doubt not
I had sensed unpleasant oaors.
"Sit down," commanded Mr. Kenney,

spanning the width with a narrow board
cut to snugly fit the sewer.
Mr. Kenney sat down facing me. We
were at the foot of the ladder. The form
of the man above holding open the man
hole was dimly visible to my blurred
eyes. The din of the city, the voices of
the children questioning him, grew faint
to my throbbing ears. The blood was
pounding through my head; my feet were
very chill. Then a merciful blackness shut
out sense and sight and sound.
"Damn!" said a voice. I' came back to
realization with a jerk. Mr. Kenney's
hand was on my shoulder. "I thought
you were going to keel over," he said.
"It's not Patrick Kenney who'll interfere
with a lady if she wants to faint; but It's
Patrick Kenney who's a-telling her she's
a fool if she does. Who's to pack you up
if you do?"
"Not Patrick Kenney," I said.
"Shure, that's the way to talk: keep up
your spunk," and he sat down again op
posite me.
I felt his critical eye on me. I knew the
d was spluttering on his lips, and I did
not dare to faint.
"You're a daisy, all rig!:?." said he,
"but your color is sorter green. Look at
me: am I cutting up any shinanegans?"
I looked at him. His head, with its
bushy shock of gray hair, rested on his
hands, his elbows pressing his knees
where the rubber boots ended. His small
blue eyes peered at me. now with a twin
kle, then with a challenge lest I weaken
again.
I looked at him long and steadily. Then
I drew a quick breath, and for the first
time i dared to glance at my surround
ings. I saw the egg-shaped sewer laid in
uneven stones, a checker board in green
and black grime. The slimy water washed
over my boots wetting them several
inches above the ankle. I shut my eyes,
looked again, and yet a third time. There
was nothing horrible, nothing revolting.
WHAT CAPTAIN SPILLANE THINKS.
THE SEWER AS A MEANS OF ESCAPE FROM THE BROADWAY JAIL
Captain Spillane, when questioned as to the possibility of using the sewer as a means of escape
from the Broadway Jail, said: 'Mr. Kenney has often spoken to me on this subject. He is a man who
should know a great deal about the sewer system of San Francisco, for he has spent a great many years
in them.
"It is a well-known fact that a man can get through an opening as large as his head. If he can
put his head through he can with more or less difficulty draw the rest of his body through. So If there
is a sufficiently large opening connecting with the main sewer a prisoner might escape through It.
Mr. Kenney says the hole is sixteen inches square. If this is so a man could undoubtedly crawl
through it. He would have to have an accomplice to let him out through a manhole. Otherwise he
might not get out of the sewer. I do not think there is much danger of a prisoner attempting this.
"The same scheme was tried in San Quentin, however, and came dangerously near succeeding.
A prisoner was missed at lock-up. They searched for him everywhere, but could not flnd him. Finally
some one noticed that the grating of the sewer in the prison yard was slightly open. The official im
mediately blocked up the sea end of the sewer.
"Sure enough, the convict was dragged out of the sewer. He had been in an hour and \raa
making his way to the sea, which meant liberty. If he had heen able to entirely close the grating it
would probably never have been discovered that he was escaping through the sewer."
The imagination had played uglier tricks
than the reality warranted.
"Pretty buttons those are!" I followed
Mr. Kenney's gaze to my outstretched
palms, where the buttons on a discarded
pair of suede party gloves showed soft
and shining as pearls.
"You're all right now." said Mr. Kenney.
"Get up and I'll show you how to walk in
here."
. . .
Mr. Kenney taught me how to walk in
the sewers, very much as McFadden was
taught how to waltz.
"One two, three! Balance with me;
You're quite a fairy, but you have your
faults.
While your left foot is lazy.
Your right foot Is crazy;
But don't be onazy, I'll teach you to
waltz."
The sticks which had served as seats we
now used as balancing poles. Mr. Ken
ney walked along as unconcernedly as
though he were pacing the green sward,
I swayed from side to side like a wind
blown bough. My feet slid about in bor
rowed rubber boots at least six sizes too
large. The bottom of the sewer was full
of unexpected holes, and I lurched into
each and every one of them. If I managed
my hands properly my feet insisted on
getting mixed up with every hole. If I
manipulated the boots according to direc
tions. I swung my arms at a wild angle
and lost my balance.
I sat down again. "How many blocks
have we gone?" I asked.
"Blocks!" exclaimed my guide in dis
gust. "Blocks, did you say? Sure, It's
never a block you've gone, and never a
block you will go if you flop down every
five minutes."
I arose and again tried to walk. I see
sawed along for perhaps a quarter of a
block. The sewer here had even more
holes than further up. some of them so
large that my feet caught in the crevices,
and it was with difficulty that I extrica
ted them.
THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 23, 1899.
Tt was hit or miss with the balancing
stick; more by good luck than good wit
when I landed the stick on the sides of
the sewer and did not serai"- the palm ot
my gloved hand as well.
Gases were rising from the mud which
I stirred up. Mr. Kenney punctuated his
gait with encouraging remarks and admo
nitions to "keep up your nerve." The
gases were getting thicker. I felt a
strange premonition of coming evil, but 1
did not. want to betray my fears. Sudden
ly Mr. Kenney turned and faced me.
-We've stirred up too much gas. Don't be
frightened if â â "
He never reached the period. There was
a terrific noise thai to my affrighted ears
boomed louder than the report of a hun
dred cannon. A red light danced before
my eyes. The sewer seemed to stretch
before me a blood-red pillar of flame. I
felt a hot breath on my cheek. I heard
a voice urge, "Run; run, run; the other
way!"
1 turned and fled. I did not know wheth
er or no he was following. Once I looked
over my shoulder. The lire was whirling
through the sewer like a thousand crim
son devils playing tag. No need of bal
ancing stick now. Wildly I stumbled on,
beautiful green and purple lights dancing
before me.
Then 1 felt a hand on my shoulder.
"It's till right here," said Mr. Kenney.
"Sit down."
I rubbed my eyes. The green and purple

which laconic explanation Mr. Kenney
handed me the stick again and we turned.
We walked about half a block In silence,
then Mr. Kenney stopped and said,
"You're a bird, you are; you're brave, you
are; that's all I have got to say to you."
A half block more and we came to a
turn In the sewer. The one we had been
walking In was five feet by three. This
one, which led into it, was three feet by
two. and about twenty feet long. At the
end was a board.
We sat down at the opening.
"See thai heard there?" said Mr. Ken
nev. "Well, that board is a part of the
building on the northwest corner of Pa
cific and Dupont streets." It was easy to
see how the highbinders had escaped
their pursuers.
It is not hard to remove a board, es
pecladv if it be In an underground wall.
l* is not difficult to hand food through
this same opening. It is not Impossible

Hut it is taking chances on running into
Patrick Kenney.
"What did you say to the highbinders?''
I asked.
"Seeing as we don't speak the same
brogue our conversation was not exten
sive," replied Mr. Kenney. "By the tine
I got back onto the street to get help the
rascals had crawled back again into the
building, boarded up the place and es
caped to some other part of Chinatown.
The monkeys In the building pretended
not to know a thing about it. Now I'll
show you the place where the fellow res
cued the girl."
We walked along a quarter of a block.
Here was a similar opening into the
building. Through this the Chinaman
crept, and with the prostrate form of the
terrified slave girl on his back he made
his way, groping Mindly, until he reached
another building which had an under
ground opening into the sewer, then out
under the blue sky until the mission was
reached.
Three months afterward there was a
Chinese wedding In the mission. Pretty
little Ah Loo, in pigeon-English, promised
to love, honor and obey the Celestial gal
lant who had carried her through the sew
ers of Chinatown to a Christian home.
"I guess you've seen all you want to.
haven't you?" asked Mr. Kenney. "We'll
go back to the manhole."
1 was more than willing to return, but
I had not vet seen all that I wished. I
had been told on good authority that Pat
rick Kenney found not a few things well
worth keeping in the sewers of San Fran
cis* Yet I had not noticed a single
thing, nor had he once stooped to pick
up anything.
Once or twice on our way down I had
started the subject, but he Invariably
pretended not to understand what I
meant.
Mr. Kenney Interrupted a plan I was
concocting to make him give me the do
sired information by stating that _*â¢
would "put me onto" the way of finding
valuables in the sewers as a sort of re
ward of merit for what he called my
pluck.
"We won't have much time," he said,
"to look, but I guess we'll flnd some
thing. Whatever we find is yours."
Mr. Kenney turned upon me fiercely
when I suggested that I did not care to
deprive him of- anything he might find.
"I've said it's to be yours, and Patrick
Kenney never goes back on his word.
You see. I've been in here so much I
know just the holes where things collect."
Every moment or two Mr. Kenney would
stop, put his hand down into a hole and
bring up a handful of pebbles, but never
a sign of ring or pin.
. "We'll flnd something yet; don't you
worry. Never been down in the sewers
in Chinatown yet that I didn't get some
thing If I hunted. It's the best place in
townâ anything you find here is sure to
be good. Chinamen don't have imitation
jewelry. You can bet their rings and ear
rings are all solid gold. When you find a
diamond in another part of town you
never know but what It's paste.
"I can't complain, though, for in the

I've found thousands of dollars' worth of
Jewelry. Just last month I found a ring
that I sold for $200. When there is no
repairing to bo done I come down here
just to look for things. You've just got
to put your hands down in the holes be

QUEER FACTS ABOUT FISH.
IT Is not too much to say that In some
ways the love of salmon passeth
that of women. To reach the objects
cf their affections they perform feats
and undergo hardships greater than
any man could do or bear; and to main
tain It they fight with a courage and fury
which might make many a soldier en
vious.
The salmons' trials begin when they
first leave the sea, on their long upriver
Journey to meet their sweethearts. Pres
ently, perhaps, they meet a high water
fall. Then the salmon backs away as
far as possible, makes a locomotive
rush and leaps for the top. He actually
whizzes through the air, his tall is mov
ing like lightning, his scales shine liKe
-enamel. Perhaps he fails to reacn
the top by a foot, but he catches the
water, hangs suspended for a moment,
and then with a miraculous strength
forces his way up and reaches the quiet
water beyond.
Perhaps the next waterfall is five feet
higher, and the salmon leaps in vain.
Then finding the feat impossible he ac
tually climbs the sides, Jumping up from
ledge to ledge and resting in little pools
until the river above Is reached. Then
he goes on pushing through rapids, and
floundering over shallows, until the
spawning ground is reached. In many
of the larger rivers of this continent the
salmon is no beauty when he reaches his
Journey's end. His scales, perhaps, are
worn off, his fins torn and his body a
masa of bruises. But, nevertheless, he
woos his lady love boldly, caresses her
tenderly. fights his rivals fiercely and
wins his bride liko a soldier.
But all fish are not so romantic. The
codfish, for instance, is unsentimental
and actually ridiculous. He is a great,
gray, ugly lish, and his name itself Is ab
surd. If there were such a thing as sub
marine humor he would figure in it as the
goat does in our own comics. The cod
fish has, in fact, an appetite which makes
the goat's look pale, and when fishermen
cut the fish open they assert that they
often find such things as scissors, sus
pender buckles, horseshoes, potato par
ing, oil cans, doorknobs, marlinsplkes,
corncobs and lndlarubber shoes.
Anotner startling story told by fisher
men Is that in heavy weather codfish eat
stones to ballast them, but It is more
likely that these rocks are taken In while
attached to sea anemones, of which the
codfish are very fond. It may be In
ferred that codfish do not object to nibble
the fingers or hands of human beings,
because the wedding ring of a drowned
woman was once found ln a cod's sto
ma, and the finder got $250 reward for
Its return.
Oysters and clams in the shell are very
popular with the codfish, and there are
vast heaps of dead shells in the ocean,
"nested" together like strawberry boxes,
which are believed to have once been In
the stomachs of codfish. The appetites
fled with the plain homespun name of
Samuel J. McMillanâ no high-sound
ing "strong man" name for him, he
says. His own fits him well enough.
In "fact, it ha* only been within the last
few years that Mr. McMillan's re
markable strength -has dawned upon
him. Of course, as a boy he was able
to equal the best man in feats of mus
cle, but he thought little of that. Now,
however, that he has reached man's
estate he is but 33. and can perform
marvels that surpass the combine ef
fort of six menâ he has gradually real
ized his superhuman strength.
At first glance McMillan would
scarcely impress one as a man so far
above the ordinary In muscular power.
You would notice, probably, that he has
a remarkably small head and massive
jaws and that he is a large man; but
his height and weight are so evenly
proportioned that he seems hardly out
of the ordinary to the passing glance.
It is when he is In the costume of the
athlete and performing some prodigious
of these fish are Insatiable. They will
fill their stomachs. All their gullets and
fill their mouths with food, and still try
to get more.
If people knew more about the fish they
eat. it is possible that a slice of "baked
blue" migr.t fill many a man with shud
dering horror, for the Blueflsh Is perÂ«
haps the most terrible and bloodthirsty
thing in all nature. The tiger has a sweet
and cheerful disposition compared with
the blueflsh, the shark seems a phleg
matic and amiable creature, and the wolf,
by comparison. Is positively mild. Tha
blueflsh make - menhaden their especial
pre-. When a school of these fish per
ceive blueflsh near they swim away with,
such hasto that the ocean foams under
them, but the blueflsh cannot be dis
tanced. They rush among the helpless
menhaden biting, tearing, thrashing and
even throwing them into the air.
They do not stop to swallow their prey,
but kill purely for the love of slaughter.
The sea Is reddened with blood and dotted
with dead fish, but the blueflsh kill on
until exhaustion stops them or until the
menhaden get into such shallow water
that 'he blueflsh do not care to follow.
times these helpless fish are so blind
with terror that they swim ashore and
are piled up ln windrows a foot deep.
The blueflsh do not eat one-tenth of thâ¬
fish they kill, although when surfeited
they are believed by some people to dis
gorge their food in order to take In an
other meal. It is estimated that during a
fair season 1,000,000 blueflsh are caught
between New Jersey and Monomoy, and
that about 999,00) remain uncaught-
Thirty or forty fish are sometimes found
In the stomach of one blueflsh. but plac
ing a blueflah's kill at only ten per day
lt will be seen that during their four
months' yearly stay on the New England
coast they destroy about 1,200,000.000,000.00fl
fish, and that is excluding the vast num
bers of minute fish eaten by little blue
flsh which are not Included in the esti
mate. Carried into avoirdupois it Is cal
culated that 2,500,000,000 pounds of fish are
eaten daily by blueflsh. Nevertheless,,
they are handsome and graceful fish. Very'
little is known of their other habits, but 1
they are so nervous while ln captivity'
that they develop corns on their noses by
trying to push the latter through the
glass sides of their tanks.

0"f B a "strong woman" Miss Char
f I Intte Dunphy, the 17-year-old
(âj daughter of a "West End avenue
V" II millionaire, is the latest marvel.
It was only last June that Miss
Dunphy was graduated from the Insti
tute 0 Holy Angels, at - Fort Lee, a
physical wreck, as so many young girls
who aim for high honors find them
selves at the close of their school days.
It was thought that she was going into
a decline, and many specialists were
consulted, but there seemed no organic
disease, simply a strong tendency to
ward nervous prostration. Drugs were
ineffective, walking was exhausting.
Ordinary gymnastics, such as are
usually practiced in schools for girls,
did not seem to do any good.
More in a joke than anything else
Miss Dunphy called at the studio of a
professional athlete just three months
ago and informed him that she wanted
to be a "strong* woman." It did not look
very promising, as she was slight,
weighing less than ninety pounds, and
was weak and ill. But there is noth
ing this athlete will not try, and so he
put her through his twenty-flve differ
ent sets of dumbbell exercises with the
lightest bells, adding to their weight
as her strength increased, . until she
could swing five-pound bells with per
fect ease.
Taking a set of bells home. Miss Dun
phy began exercising before breakfast,
and soon found the work delightful and
easy; her appetite increased, and she
began to long to do greater feats. For
variety's sake her instructor allowed
her to learn several weight lifting ex
ercises, and found to his astonishment
that she could actually do them, and
do them gracefully and firmly. From
one feat to another she went, until now
she has mastered every sort of strong
woman feat, and her teacher himself
gazes on her with astonishment.
Miss Dunphy has a most wonderful
back, and the . luscular development of
the entire body c.mes to its support, so
that she does Max Unger's tricks. One
of these is the lifting of a big barbell
from the floor with one hand, turning
lt and holding it high above the head
without a tremor. This same barbell
she then places upon the floor and lies
down flat on her back with the bell at
her head, and raises lt with both hand-,
until it is straight above her head, then
holding it with one hand only, rises to
a sitting and then a standing position
with the bell high above her head still.
Another feat Miss Dunphy does with
the same bell in connection with the
"Roman chair." This chair has a strap
across the seat, into which she slips
her feet, then she leans over the back
until her head rests on the floor, reaches
over her head for the bar and rises with
it to a standing position on the seat of
the chair, with the bell high over her
head, then descends in the same man
ner and lays it on the floor above her
head again. These feats require enor
mous strength, as any one can easily
ascertain by trying them. â¢ yyfy

while his foot is very small. He wears
a No. 6 shoe.
He has teeth the like of which have
never been known. Not regular teeth
nor beautifully white, but long, strong
yellow teethâ that can literally
bite through iron. His Jaw and neck
seem one and part of his broad shoul
ders, so firmly are they set.
The best proof of his power in jaw
and teeth is shown in the feats he per
forms, several of which he has had
photographed for The Sunday Call.
He takes an ordinary three-eighths
round iron a yard long and, using his
teeth as a vise, twists out letters of the
alphabet.
With a rod of iron ten feet long and
one and one-eighth inches In diameter
balanced in his mouth, he braces him
self squarely on his legs and then al
lows the rod to be bent by the com

THE GENEROSITY OF WOMEN.
Â»-* WRS. RUSSELL SAGE has
f\/\ reached some very definite
I y I opinions regarding men and
\* I women as a result of her many
_i_ years of work in the field of
charities. She has been en
gaged recently in raising a fund in
crdar that tha Wo____a__ , '_Â» Jios3ltal may
Have a splendid new building. The struct
ure will cost $400,000. Mrs. Sage has raised
$300,000. She expects that early in the fall
she will obtain the remaining $100,000.
I had a chat with her a few days ago
on the subject of generosity. The wife of
the great financier is an interesting con
versationalist. She talks in a measured
way, but she cannot be described as slow
of speech. Mrs. Sage may begin a sen
tence very deliberately, but you will soon
realize that when she gets into the middle
of It the words come quickly.
"In my experience," said she, "I have
found that men look too much on the tem
poral side of affairs, while women look to
he eternal. This is a rather severe dic
tum, but my observation leads me to that
belief. Of course, there are exceptions.
"Women labor for great moral ends.
Men do also, but I must say that the
secular side of their nature is stronger
than in women. It would be much better
in grip and arm to straighten
out the curve and literally pull
the metal asunder. But driving a nail
in by a blow of the hand, protected by
the slight covering of a handkerchief,
is the most marvelous of all. This he
really does, as shown in the photos
herewith, and moreover, he can break
the nail off with his teeth or draw it
from the board with equal facility.
McMillan first realized that he was a
bit beyond the ordinary about three
years ago. He was in a small town,
where Jack Donohoe was giving some
exhibitions in dumbbell work and hap
pened to be In the theater one night
when Jack offered $20 to any man who
could put a 107-pound dumbbell over
his head with one hand.
McMillan's friends persuaded him to
try and he won the 520 so easily that
it opened his eyes.
He is a blacksmith by trade, does not
believe In training, nor in the usual ex
ercises of the athlete and eats and
drinks what he pleases.
if the men paid more attention to the
eternal things than to the temporal."
During the conversation, however, Mrs.
Sage cited the case of one woman who
was inclined to lean to the temporal side
of affairs. The woman is very wealthy.
Mrs. Sage had heard often of her love of
money, so she determined to ascertain
whether it was so strong that an appeal
in the name of charity would be disre
garded.
Mrs. Sage sent a pencil note to the
wealthy woman. Inclosed with lt was a
printed circular requesting contributions
for the new building of the Woman's Hos
pital. The woman returned the circular
without any comment, and also without
any subscription.
Before the conversation closed Mrs.
Sage made one reference to her husband.
"Mr. Sage would rather give money."
she said, "to women than to men. He pre
fers to support them in charitable w_*r...
He has great confidence in women."
Oom Paul's Spies.
Xo one ever denied that Oom Paul,
President of the South African republic,
was an astute old statesman. Time and
again he has beaten our British cousins
in diplomacy and has proved his worth
as a diplomatist.
At the time of the Jameson raid it
caused Dr. Jameson and his associates
considerable surprise that their plans
were known to the Boers almost as soon
as they were conceived. The British were
met, fought and defeated by an ambushed
body of men almost at the beginning of
their, attack, and it was believed at the
time that one of their number had turned
traitor and given the plans to the Boers,
but now the secret is known.
The old warrior enlisted the services of
the barmaids of Johannesburg ln the po
litical secret service. Through them ho
learned that new men were being enlisted
ln the Cape police and that new guns were
being shin.cd. week after week, from
England. Through the same source he
was informed of the attempts that ware
feeing made by English politicians to forco
the hands of the Government of the Or
ange Free State in case war should be
declared by the British Government
against his country. The Englishmen
babbled all this over their cups, and the
barmaids' winning smiles and bright eyes
never gave them the suspicion that they
were telling secrets of vital importance.
No sooner had the pretty barmaids en
ticed from the sturdy colonists their im
portant secrets than Oom Paul was in
formed. The old statesman knew how to
parry blow with blow. To the amazement
of the British, no sooner had they in
creased their force of available fighters
by means of secret enlistment than they
were Informed that Oom Paul had en
listed a still larger number of men. XO
sooner had their guns arrived from Eng
land than they found out that the Boers
also had obtained from a firm in Germany
a larger number of weapons of still bet
ter manufacture. By means of always
being forewarned Kruger warded off war.

with tiny silk figures in it. It is literally
a daisy dress, designed for a dear friend
of th Countess de Castellans, who Is to
visit the Countess this' summer at lier

This dotted dress, which is for feeding
the lucks and doing the homely garden
maid tasks which the French think it is
so smart to copy for a few months In th:.
summer, is lined with a thin wash silk
of pale pink, which shines through the
white mull. The waist is the same with
a broad band of plain white silk down the
middle of the front.
A very coarse flounce of lace is set upon
a Ik_H of arbutus pink velvet, and at the
neck there is a small bow stock of the
dame velvet. Certainly a very neat dress
for the country maid.
The p'alnneHS at the shirt waist is much
relieved by the stock with stole ends,
which Is .becoming more popular. The
most becoming of these are of wide white
lawn, double and stitched along the entire
outside edge, even the â¢ points being
stitched. The lawn is tied in a bow with
short loops, leaving ends that hang to the
waist line. This* same becoming stole is
made from lawn of all colors, and as it
can be laundered ls deservedly a popular
feature of the summer wardrobe. In
making this style care should be taken to
narrow the neckstrip to a width of not
over two Inches; the ends arÂ© four or
flve inches wide.

reform also. Circulars have been distrib
uted calling for gloveless and hatless con
gregations. In Chicago the matter is be
ing discussed on a plane of higher criti
cism, one preacher declaring that "the
attractiveness of a woman is cruelly ob
scured, distorted and minimized by her
hat and toggeries. With these she ob
scures her beauty, and her nobility is in
timidated and" driven inward, if not
wrecked.'.''
This has an ominous sound. Measles
an.l other complaints have a vicious habit
of "striking in," and always with unpleas
ant results. If the- wearing of a hat and
"toggeries" is going to Intimidate, strike
in and ultimately wreck the nobility of
womankind, the anti-hat reform cannot
be taken too seriously.

narrowest black braid was the simple

lapels that were faced with heavy deep

The sunbonnet is Intended more for the

What is the use of worrying over it?
We cannot very well Instruct old Grandpa

Think of the dear old lady, with soft,
silvery locks, gentle and sweet-faced, who,
after the varied and trying experiences of
existence, while patiently awaiting the
end, is devoting herself with loving un

her own pleasure.
Then let your fancy roam to the artifi

There Is really nothing more grotesque
than the futile effort some women make

us raise our voices to high heaven and
pray that none of us shall ever become so
deluded.
But, dear me! we started out to discuss
gray hair, didn't we? : -".:'"_.
Gray hair is not always the result of
years, for frequently we see a youthful
face framed in silvery threads, In such
cases the prematurely gray hair ls usu
ally an inheritance, although it may be
caused by dissipation. or ill health, anx
iety or too Intense an application of the
mind. Anything that disturbs the brain
or affects the nervous system will cause
the hair to become dull and lifeless and
white.
The failure of the hair pigment is near
ly- always the cause of the change In color.
Each little hair shaft contains, besides an
oily substance which is necessary for its
or heavy linen, or they are transparent.
The transparent goods of this year are
not the X-ray patterns of last year, the
openworks, canvases and coarse grain
fabrics, but are line sheer goods - that
show the lining like a haze.
White shirt waists which display the
underwaist In the old-fashioned style, but
still becoming, like some of Miss Grant s
trousseau, those which -are now being
made in Paris, are said to be so thin as
to require the most elegant corset cover.
One of these waists has a corset cover
which was made for it. , The cover or vn T
derwafst is of Mechlin lace as fine as a
cobweb. The waist itself is "pineapple"!
net so thin that it is a mere web.
Notwithstanding the rage for all things
American there is a tremendous amount
of exploring being done. Prosperity sea
son in the United States has brought
prosperity season to Paris. The trousseau
of Miss Grant is the most talked about
thing in Paris just now: and the order
which the Prince has sent to a Bond
street jeweler is the gossip of the Ameri
can colony.
It Is a tiara of pearls, and diamonds,
such a wonderful thing as was never seen

nourishment, a certain amount of mineral
Ingredients. The failure of one of these
minerals will cause the hair to lose Its
color.
Very fair hair contains magnesia: chest
nut and brown -hair is rich in sulphur, and
In very dark and black hair iron predom
inates. The supply of iron pigment usu
ally falls first, and for that reason black
or dark hair is wont to turn gray earlier
than any other.
Sometimes, with, a view to restoring the
color to prematurely whitened hair, iron
or sulphur is taken internally. As to the
merit of this treatment I cannot speak
positively, but of one thing I am quite
certainâ no outward application will Im
part a permanent 'color to the hair. It
stands to reason that this cannot be so,
for the natural coloring matter of the hair
is inclosed within mlriute. tubes overlaid
by imperceptible scales, and this coloring
matter can be thrown from the roots of
the hair through these tubes only by a
physical process. .'â¢â â 77
. So beware of all so-called hair restora
tives. Shun them as you would a grip
microbe. They are dyes, pure and sim
ple. They are unclean and often danger
ous. The only sensible thing to do is to
take th" gray hairs in 'hand when they
flrst make their appearnce. Not literally
in hand, for you know the old saying.
''For every white hair pulled ten will
come to its funeral," but after the first
ones have begun to peep out from among
the glossy locks start right in and follow
the rules of sensible, practical hygiene,
and you will be .able to retard the others
ln their mad onslaught. -
Gray hair can be avoided to a certain
extent if taken in time. The health must
be well guarded. Get out doors and ex
ercise; rest as much as you. possibly can;
eat nourishing foods, and see to it that
the scalp and hair, as well as the body,
are kept in a state of absolute cleanliness.
in the Cantacuzene family before. Miss
Grant, it Is rumored, is to bring an im
mense dower to her Prince. Surely he will
not have to buy silk dresses for her for
many a day to come, for the trousseau or
iel that has been placed with one house
alone includes twelve beautiful silk
gowns, all tight fitting, with sheath skirt,
i::<; elaborately trimmed bodices, many of
them with the tunic. They are in all the
delicate new shades .with three of the old
ones, namely, a navy blue, an olive brown
and an old-fashioned pearl gray.
So many skirts are required this season
that the coutourieres have graciously
provided for the emergency. They supply
a skirt, seamless and ready to be sewed
upon the hand. It comes all in one piece
and the seamstress has only to sew It up
in the back, open the sides to form a flap
placket and to put it on the band, when
it will be found ready to wear. These
can be purchased in the shops and you
see women of fashion purchasing a dozen
or so skirts to be quickly made at home
by the seamstress, who can make six or
eight in a day. There is only one seam
up the back and a handâ no binding, no
fitting, no anxiety about the hanging.

So & bid thee all a briyht

Another excellent preventive Is keeping
the hair clipped or singed. To do this
properly the hair should be rolled In amall
twists and rubbed up the wrong way, so
that all the tiny ends will bristle out.
Then singe every split end. The hair
splits at the ends because of insufficient
nourishment at the roots, and the singe
ing takes away- the dead part and invig
orates that which is thriving. Do this
every month, following with a shampoo.
A disease of the scalp will Induce white
hair quicker than old age. The scalp
must be kept perfectly clean and free
from dandruff. Sunning and airing the
hair are of benefit also, and the following
shampoo will be found delightful:
Beat the whites of four eggs to a froth.
Apply to the hair, a little at a time, until
the scalp Is well saturated. Then rub
gently with the finger tips. Pour some
dissolved castile soap over the head and
rub until the scalp is free of dust and
dandruff. Rinse in several clear waters.
Dry with warm towels and sit ln the sun
light for twenty minutes.
To keep hair that is already white from
becoming yellow, wash it often with cas
tile soap and rinse in clear water in which
are a few drops of bluing. This is said
to keep the hair a beautiful silvery
white.
Curling tongs should never be used on
white hair, as they will discolor It.

my doubts about it being such a success
as a wrinkle eradicator. It may benefit
the flabby condition of the skin. Suppose
you try It a while and see.

than happy to pass along to you. She
says it was given her by a noted beauty
specialist, and that it is particularly e.fl
r-acious in the treatment of blackheads.
Nice of her. wasn't it? It is to use com
mon table salt when washing the face.
Merely fill the hand with salt, dampen
with water and with it scour the face and
neck until they are all In a glow. It may
irritate the skin a bit at first, but never
mindâ keep It up. The salt acts as a
stimulant to the pores of the skin and
will assist them in throwing off the waste
matter' that clogs them. I have not a
doubt in the world that this Is a very ex
cellent-thing. Suppose you try it on those
persistent little black specks before yon

Lemon juice is as strong an acid a.-* any
one should ever apply to the. face. A
little borax added makes It more effec

the greatest consideration.
The rcadbed problem was solved by the
building of a tunnel through the Contra

great many ways this is the most wonder

pleted one night last week. The last tim

Brown had charge of the work at the tnn
nel and gave his best efforts to bring
ing it to a successful conclusion.
"We consider this the most remarkable

after the las- timber was pal in place.

THE SAX FRAKCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 23, 1899.
The story of the building of the Valley
Road tn -â¢"'-- the Contra Ccsta
hills is indeed a remarkable one. The ap
proaches or cuts before the tunnel proper
commences are each several hundred feet
long and cut through a very- loose earth-
Work on the approaches was com
menced Thanksgiving day, Mil. Accord
ing to calculations and surveys 'here was
about eO.O-O cubic feet of earth to -be
moved. This, however, was fir Gram what
was event taken out.
" From the day the work was commenced
nntll the last timber was in place there
was not a single day's cessation. Night
and day. Sundays and holidays, the la
borers kept . king away, and '.he engi
neers were equally hard at It working out
plans to meet the different exigencies that
cropped up. Even on the Fourth of July
the work went on and the only semblance
of celebration was the explosions of the
powder used for blasting the loose earth,
so that it ccuid be shoveled into the dump
cars. But the laborers did not consider
It celebrating, because the work was the
same that they had been doing for days
and days.
As the earth was taken out of the cuts
o* the approaches, on the lines laid down
In the survey, trouble began. The earth
proved .-: it --re fragile than was ex
pected. Caving of 'he banks was fre
quent and after a certain rainstorm the
entire cut was filled up nearly level. Of .
course the approach was widened In ac
cordance and made a complete change
necessary in the plans. The work of re
moving the landslide earth took several
days and was most severe on men and
horses who had to work knee deep In
mud. All th'S delayed the work, but in
time everything was accomplished and
work on the tunnel proper commenced.
.This was In May of last year.
Work was commenced at both ends of
the tunnel at the same time. The Marti
nez end was the flr3t to get well under
way.
At this end the first few hundred feet
of the work was through a hard sand
atone. Then came a hard, flinty rock that
was close to the bottom and made work
stow.
After that trouble commenced, for a
sort of black adobe slate was struck that
proved about as manageable is a lump
of quicksilver.
As fast as the work went along the
timbers were put in. While the cut was
being made through '.he rock the timbers
stayed where they were put as Mi as
the rock of Gibraltar. But when the black
adobe slate was struck things were dif
ferent.
About -. hundred feet of timbering had
been put in of the same style A3 that
in the stony section. It looked all right
and everybody was congratulating them
selves on the great progress being made.
But one day Engineer Brown was call

FROM SUNDAY-SCHOOL
TO COMING OPERA
WHO is there that has ever seen
Hattie Bell Ladd in the many
different characters which
she has been so successfully
playing at the Grand Opera
house who does not wish to
know more than can be gained from
"the front" and the librettos and pro
grammes attainable there, of the his
tory and personality of this charming
little singer and actress?
The little New England girl who grad
uated from Sunday-school entertain
ments to the comic-opera stage Is still
as simple and unspoiled as one of the
sweet May-flowers of her native State
when first the soft mantle of spring
snow Is brushed aside from Its fragrant
pink-and-white beauty.
Our recent fogs and winds having
played havoc with the pretty contralto's
vocal cords, she was, after valiantly
carrying out her role of ' Carmen ln spite
of acute physical suffering, compelled
during the run of "Olivette" to resign
the part of the Countess Rousillon and
appear in the less exacting but, from a
merely visual standpoint, quite as fas
cinating character of Moustique. Ar
rayed in the by no means superabund
ant but decidedly becoming garments of
the gay young midshipman, she re
ceives a. favored caller with al! the gra
cious and gentle dignity of a high-bred
BostonCse.
A beautiful Pomeranian puppy lying
on the lounge amid a swirl of satins and
lacesâ a fluffy bundle of soft, white hair
out of which pokes a long, fpxy nose

eningly, and is only quieted when his

ately. Above thai head, in bold relief
against the gray shadow of the wall,
appears a large placaid on which this
futile mandate is set forth in large
black letters: "No dogs or any other
animals allowed in the dressing-rooms."
Miss Ladd glances up at it and smiles
serenely, and her reigning pet yawns
unreservedly and snuggles down into
his comfortable nest again.
"Dogs and horses are my twin weak
nesses," declares Ihe singer. "I am a
friend to all dogs, blue-blooded or mon
grel, and pride myself upon being able
to drive, and drive well, anything in the
shape of a horse that ever wore har
ness. Ride? Xo; queerly enough, I do
not ride at aii. for all I am so fond of
horses. Eastern girls do not go In for

go on again in the part. She awoke next
morning to flnd the critics telling her
with one accord that It was the very best
work she had done and that she had
proven herself to be one of the foremost
emotional actresses of the day. She
smiled a little, ate her breakfast with
Increased appetite and went back to duty
and her part as meek as a lamb.
The reception of "The New Magdalen"
is another surprise. After each rehearsal
a despairing hand would prune and cut
and rewrite and alter the action with a
view to bringing the play within the ap
preciation and approval of an audience
of to-day, and many were the predictions
of failure. Miss Roberts is a master hand
at cutting, and will never, if possible,
speak an unnecessary line. At the close
of the scenic rehearsal they had not yet
decided what the ffnal speech, known to
the profession as the "tag," was to be,
and after Mr. Moore had exhausted his
patience waiting for a decision he said:
"Well, Miss Roberts, when you want the
curtain rung down to-night just wave to
me. I'll be on the lookout for the signal."
I haven't found out yet whether it was
waved or winked down, but I do know
that the speech served to put a tired set
of mummers 1; a royal good humor.
Miss Roberts has a keen sense of humor
and has many a good story to tell ln con
nection with her stage Ufa. Here is a
h|attie Bell Ladd as Moustique ir) "Olivette."
choice morsel. At a certain "one night
stand" where the stage manager was
more energetic than intelligent "the gar
den scene for Faust was set with a bril
liant red carpet." When Miss Roberts
reached the wings ano was confronted
with Its gaudy patterns the shock almost
made her forget her lines. Rising to the
occasion, however, she entered and threw
poor Faust Into merry confusion by the
following enlarged speech: "Father left
us something to possess, this pretty house
and garden and (with an elaborate
gesture) this beautiful carpet!" Faust
went up stage in a panic. Marguerite filled
in the gap of glee with a few extra lines
and the audience was none the wiser.
Mme. Modjeska was in the habit of
drawing queer caricatures on the letter
she sends to Nichette in the last of Ca
mille and Miss Roberts, while all tho
world is in tears, herself included, writes
the funniest of letters. Here la the one
she wrote at the Sunday night perform
ance:
"My Dear Nichette: I am dying to
night for the last time. I cannot come
to church, but I will meet you revivified
to-morrow at 11 o'clock. Yours miracu
lously, MERCY MERRICK."
Those who sit in front of the footlights
know but little of the weariness of con
stant rehearsal. At 4 o'clock on Tuesday
I found the Frawley company still re
hearsing "Sans Gene" and they had been
hard at work since 9. Even then Miss
Bates was merry as a cricket and full of
enthusiasm, cheering the company to a
good humor with her happy voice and
bright smile. Not till rehearsal was over
did she realize how tired she was and
collapse and a paltry two hours'
rest against a trying evening's perform
ance. "The Dancing Girl"' has played to
a most satisfactory week's business and
the staircase fall is eagerly applauded.
To my mind it has absolutely nothing to
recommend it. It is simply a piece of
daring gymnastics, without beauty, with
out reason, without need, and the strain to
save one's neck and limb must be fear
fully trying to the nerves of an actress.
No author has the right to demand such
a sacrifice to make his play a success.
"The i Dancing Girl" sets us moralizing.
"I'm the topmost rose of the topmost
branch and I love the sun!" says Dru
silla. So do. all the topmost roses of the
topmost branches and ln their triumph
they forget that "roses must live and
love, but winds must blow," and how the
wind can toss and tear and scatter such
to the dust. It is the old story; carefully
insulate a girl from life and one day when
the woman In her wakes she will feel
herself bound and her chief concern will
be that the bonds be broken, not how
they should be broken, and on she rushes
through experience, too often to ruin.
The play is a lesson to many a parent
who feels himself wise in his rigid au
thority. -
"Mmc, Sans .Gene" Â»r _______ ea to ba
a fine performance. We have not seen
it for several years, but we still remem

role of Napoleon. From observation at
rehearsals, I predict that Miss Bates will
be a delightful Sans Gene, and she does
not in the least suggest Kathryn Kid

Another California girl ls about to have

incident of San Francisco morals and
manners which Is perhaps without pa

fall of the Bastile may not be pleasant.
The facts, however, demonstrate -Â»-.__
existence of an evil, and their exposure
may suggest a remedy.
The fall of the Bastile was in ex
cuse a few days age for a dlt justing,
outrageous org.-. In which men of
prominence and women, clinging still
to their thought of self-respect, partici
pated. Men that deal justice in local
courts sang ribald songs and clinked
glasses with women whose acquain
tance they would not dare admit in the
light of day. "Women, whose sober m -
stinct prompts them to draw their
skirts In hasty repulsion from possible
contact with some of their sex whose
skirts are soiled, danced on an equality
c* sham* with abandoned creatures of
the tenderloin.
Lawyers, Judges, business and pro
fessional men were there cheek by jowl
with the human refuse of the..clty. The
celebration in honor of the fall of the
Bastile had ended at midnight. Until
that hour the French citizens of the
city, their friends and sympathizers
had obeyed the dictates of a worthy
sentiment and worthily honored a day
that marks an e^och In the history of
the French people. After that hour the
place became the scene of incidents, the
description of which could not be Justi
fied except as an exposure of a shame
ful evu.
- At midnight thrones passed in and
... of the gates of the Chutes. Those
that were going had remembered a day
sacred to them It. their traditions and
ln their love of their mother country.
Those that were coming were eager for
a night's debauch. It was not long be

level for the revelers. All classes min

The gayest among the drunken
throng was a petite, black-eyed, pretty
girl, richly gowned. There was no - ---

that did not meet her approval. She
was rating the fall of the Bastile
as the closing incident of her life, which
had known nothing of care, nothing

This girl mingled with every crowd-
She sat at a table in the drinking pa
vilion, touching glasses in reckless
good fellowship with men who would
r.ot admit her acquaintance, except
after midnight. She brushed against
women whose veiled faces indicated
that either their position or their pre

a confusion of sights ar.d sounds. Mu

glasses were clinking and crashing.
Now and then sorr.^ cf the revelers
would divide themselves from the
throng nnd an indecent dance would
mark another incident of the night.
Loud voices would grow louder, laugh
ter and merry words would turn to
curses, caresses change to blows and
friends would supplement with their
fists the arguments of their drunken
tongues.
Police officers, conveniently deaf,
dumb and blind, would recover their
senses, separate the quarrelers and ac
cept again the hospitality of the bar.
The girl, whn was spending her last
hours of life in the midst of scenes that
still possessed an attraction but no nov
elty, watched 11 all. As the night ad
vanced all restraint was discarded. AH
classes were mingling in riotous un
concern. The girl and her chaperone,
who happened to be her mother, left
the drinking pavilion, where the lights
burned brightly and the babel of voices
confused.
Outside in the dim g-Is i - grounds
the throng was as great as it was In
the pavilion. The girl stopped at the
merry-go-round. Music, woefully and
discordantly metallic, was sounding a
popular march. Couples breast to

Slayton appeared in their midst
and announced that he had come

ln 1850, was composed of a select few of
the worst characters In California: and
it was not long before the minister found
that the weapons wherewith he had com

parish were insufficient to do battle with
his hosts in the mining camp.
Among those who despitefully useo
him none was more active than a certain
tall, dark risaged miner, who, unluckily
for Slayton, possessed an almost phen

men. King was his name, and the Rev.
Francis sometimes half believed that the
name was significant and that he was In
very truth the incarnate "King" of Dark

There was only one person In camp
who dared to question this man's right
to tyrannize and this was a tiny, fair

"My son Joe." And "My son Joe" feared

the fun. With a sigh he closed the

face distorted by passion and his black

Her voice was loud in hysterical
laughter, and as she stepped from the
merry-go-round eh*Â» reeled. Her chap
erone caught her and led her toward
the Saucing pavilion. The band was
blaring a waltz. The air was thick
with smoke and the place reeked with
the fames of liquor. A broad avsnua
had been opened In the middle of the
pavilion by the crowd. A man and a
woman were dancing a vulgar dance.
Hands were clapping, voices were
shouting in encouragement, the danc
ers were excited and flushed- The
scene was not a pleasant one and the
police in the pavilion declined to watch
It. They had only one duty to perform
at the ball â they were deputized only
to prevent people from killing each

way out of the dancing pavilion. As
they left the place their attention was

formed a short cut to a distant camp. He
was tired and sat down to rest. His eyes
wandered idly along the trail that crept
upward past a solitary pine tree and was
lost to sight as it descended on the other
side of the. hill.
Something moving near the tree arrested
his glance, and, looking more attentively,
be saw a man leaning against it, with his
face turned In the direction of the gulch.
Presently the figure disappeared and at
almost the same instant King came strid

At this interesting juncture there was a
sharp wh!r-r-r in the air. a noose de
scended over Markley's head and tight
ened relentlessly about his throat, while
his arms sprawled out and his hand
dropped the knife and clutched the empty
air. Released, Slayton sprang to his feet
and saw Joe, who had turned the end of
his lasso about the trunk of the .pine tree
and was tugging away with a will. He
snatched his late adversary's knife, re

called upon the boy to slack the lasso.

insolently given. A woman, who might
have been judged pretty were it not
for her drunken leer, was reeling to re
tain her place on a table. She was
disheveled, intoxicated, pitiable. She
held a beer glass In her hands and with
dimming eyes tried with a glance to
answer her escort's toast. She raised
her hand, and as she toppled from the
table her companion caught her.
In the center of the tent a young fel
low was playing upon an accordion a
ribald tune. Two women, surrounded
by a group of roistering, applauding
loafers, were stepping vulgarly to the
music. The orgy had reached its cli
max. The police looked on and were
satisfied that beer glasses were not fiy-
Ing through the air and that no heads
were being smashed. The tent was al
most suffocating In Its heat. Men and
women, who have been seen elsewhere
and under other conditions In the city,
Jostled each other in eager rivalry to
watch the dancers. Chairs were over
turned and women Jumped anon tables
to secure a point of advantage.
As the music progressed the applause
became more riotous. Drunken voices
shouted words of encouragement and
the dancers became bolder. For a mo
ment It seemed as If an unexpected in
cident would Interrupt the revelry. A
party of four â two men and two wo
men â had been seated at a table In th*
tent exchanging maudlin compliments.
Suddenly there was a scuffle. Soma
word- not particularly pleasant, had
been passed. The women were in each
other's hair. They were scratching.
pulling and swearing. Suddenly one of
the combatants was forced backward
against a table. She received a vicious
blow and attempted to recover. The
effort cost her more than she expected.
She toppled forward and fell heavily.
"When they picked her up her face was
spattered with blood. A long gash in
her forehead explained the cause. A
police officer rushed to her assistance,
. her woman friend was hustled away
and the dance was not interrupted. The
music seemed to spread a contagion of
recklessness. In a few minutes most
of the men and women in the tent were
dancing..
The women dancers were becoming
tired and a child took their place. He
-i! a boy who said that he was 12
years of age, but looked older. In his
manner there was something that
should not have been there. He knew
too much of the vicfousness of the
. night. His face was prematurely old,
and as he danced he winked knowingly
to an unhealthy looking young fellow
who nodded persistent approval of the
dance.
The music became -wilder. The ap
plauding spectators become more dem
onstrative. The boy entered with nerv
ous excitement into the spirit of ths
revelry. He was intoxicated. He was
one of many boys, every one of whom
was in knickerbockers, who had been
allowed to enter the grounds and then,
under the very eyes of the police, had
gone from table to table. drinking the
dree.? of whisky and beer glasses.
These boys staggered from table to
table. One of them sought to 'climb a
pole of the tent and sank helplessly to
the floor. BBs boy companions reci'vi
toward him, the roisterer of the night
applauded and the police saw nothTns..
It was a scene that probably nevor had
a parallel in San Francisco.
While the orgy was at Its height, ths
woman, who had determined to _nd he
existence with the night, gave to the
scene Its dramatic climax. As the boy
was dancing to the quick mover of
the music a waiter, tray laden with
glasses, passed into the tent. The girl
saw- him. She raised her skirts, her
foot shot toward the tray and the
glasses crashed to the floor. For a mo
ment there was confusion, but out of
it appeared the figure of the girl She
was on the table dancing the cancan.
She was the brightest, most reckless
being In the place. She had in her
pocket the poison that was to end her
life.
In a few moments the music ceased.
The girl was lifted from the table and
the boy, under the searching espionage
of his unhealthy looking preceptor,
passed his hat among his drunken ad
mirers for vagrant nickels. The girl
left the tent. She took a lingering look
at the glistening lights, heard the hum
of music and laughter and saw th- reel
ing figures of men and women. In the
morning her mother found her dead.
will leave this vicinity and never again
make an attempt to injure King?"
"He wronged me." said Markley sullen
ly, dropping his eyes.
"You promise â remember, lt may mean
life or death to you."
There was a pause. Then Markley
raised his head and said:
"I promise."
"Will you take this?" asked the minis
ter, offering him the only money he had.
. Mark.-;- half smiled and showed a hand
ful of- gold coin. Then without a word
he walked away along the trail.
For some weeks before Christmas the
men at Camp Ugly had been at work upon
a new cabin. They observed a strange
reticence as to who the future occupant
was to be and the Rev. Francis Slayton,
who had lately become a popular man
in camp, had received very unsatisfactory
answers to his questions res... rding it.
On Christmas morning, however, all
doubt was dispelled. A delegation of
men, headed by King, arrived at Slay
ton's cabin and escorted the minister In
triumph to the new edifice. Here King
made a speech to the effect that the men
regarded Slayton as a brave man and a
gentlemanâ a parsonâ and that by
a unanimous vote he had been elected
"Parson of Camp Ugly," to preach the
Gospel at any time he saw fit and that
the new cabin was herewith presented to
him out and out to ba used as a church. .

How It Feels to Fall
Ten Thousand Feet
By Slgoor Mirigi, tbe Italiai) Aerooaut.
VIENNA, July 6.â lt was the last
of June, shall I ever forget that
day!
An aeronaut reads time by as
censions, not by the calendar.
To me lt was earlier, for, by a strange
list of fatalities, I had not made an ascent
this year. Once, when I was about to
ascend a hurricane struck the mountain
on which I stood; again the Alps were
burled in fog; three separate times my
assistants failed me and I could not get
gas generated; and so the spring passed
away, until June, when all things pointed
to a successful sail.
My balloon on that day was my silk
bag which is the largest of the three
balloons I possess. It ls very light and
very strong. It Is covered outside with
a coating of varnish, laid on many times
and recoated with wax; and Anally cov
ered with a patented preparation to ren
der it perfectly air-tight. The silk was
woven specially for my balloon and to
the best of my knowledge there was not
a flaw in lt. To be perfectly positive I
hired a silk maker of Lyons to go over
the entire surface of the silk with his
light and dark tests and he reported every
fiber exact.
In case of a leakage in a large alr
fllled bag like a balloon there is always
serious danger. The break, however
small, will quickly spread, and the air
rushing out will break a great rent in
it before the balloon can be lowered, a
rupture In the balloon means a fall for
the aeronaut. And few have lived to
describe a fall.
On this day, accompanied by no one,
I resolved to take a sail from a moun
tain and, having gone for the summer to
the Rhine country, I selected one of the
small hills of the Pennine Alps as the
best place for my sail.
The day was clear, with a slightly up
ward current of wind coming from the
west and blowing toward the north at a
not very rapid rate, though there was a
tendency toward a south wind which I did
not like. It Intercepted the west wind and
created a whirlwind about a thousand feet
above the earth in a way that might
throw me out of my course. But I re
solved to go on Just the same, trusting to
my skill to steer the balloon and get above
the intercepting currents.
With my balloon fully Inflated and
packed, if I may use the expression, with
wind enough to last three days. I ordered
my assistants to await the signal, then
cut the ropes and let me ascend.
Though I have made thousands of as
cents I never remember to have started

children.
At the first hint of gray in the east
ern sky, at the first crow of the cock,
the farm household is up and stirring,
and breakfast, with the Usual strong
coffee the Boer loves, is over by the
time the sun rises. The men are out
and about at once, looking after just
the same chores . as on an American
farm in the West, save those who are
off to replenish the larder by shooting
a springbok, a hartebeest or some
such species of deer. The women have
plenty of work about the house. The
genuine old Boer farm furnishes itself
every necessary to its occupants. The
furniture is often made by the farmer,
or he has great, unwieldy, . carved
chests and bureaus which have come
to him from his ancestors. He can
upward with the velocity of this one. It j
was positively bewildering. If I had been
propelled from the mouth of a cannon
pointed directly up into the air I could
not have shot upward with half the speed
or directness. In an instant I knew the
truth. I had miscalculated the distance
at which the westerly and southerly cur
rents intercepted each other, and I had
voluntarily launched myself in a whirl
pool. Never mind! As long as the current
bore me directly up all would be well. But
how high would it carry me? On and on!
Up and up I went! It was alarming
though delightful. So rapid was my pace
that the balloon could scarce keep .pace
with. the car dangling underneath. The
light little vehicle danced at Its ropes as
though it were a pleasure craft at Its
moorings upon the bay of Venice.
Once or twice I felt the car suddenly
shift, as though It were ln a swirling cur
rent and were about to wheel rapidly
around. But no, lt always . righted itself.
Its ropes, twisted for the moment, would
straighten and a little tug at the basket
would tell me that I was again being
drawn along by the balloon.
I remember measuring the wind then
and taking my chart. The figures now
show that I must have been at that mo
ment exactly 10,000 feet above the level of
the sea. While I was setting down the
figures and congratulating myself that we
were now in a smooth sea of air, a
strange thing happenedâ a wonderful
thing. Up, as I was, above the reach of
the cloud mists, there came a great loud
report, like a peal of thunder!
1 glanced upward; the sky was smiling;
the great sun standing sentinel over a
pleasant day. The thunder earns again,
this time a long, rolling report like a
rumbling from heaven. At the same time
I noticed that we were sinking.
In an instant the truth became clear to
me. The balloon had burst and we were
falling to the earth. I say .we. because
the entire car becomes human to a bal
loonist, like a locomotive to Its driver;
or, to be more commonplace, a bicycle to
its rider.
I looked down involuntarily, which was
a foolish thing to do. We were descend
ing rapidlyâ so rapidly, in fact, that as I
looked I saw. a tall tower come in sight,
next I saw another and another. We were
dropping Into a city. I afterward learned
that it was Vienna, but at that moment
I could only see the spire pointing straight
upward toward me as though it were
waiting to receive us on Its steel-tipped
point.
I thought Instantly of throwing my bal
last overboardâ a desperate thing to doâ i
make his own shoes. His women dress ,
and weave his own sheep's wool, and .
make their and his clothes from it.
During the day he works leisurely,
content to make a living out of the
ground. He has been seen sitting in
his wagon for hours watching an enter- |
prising, hustling Uitlander with won- \
der, as the foreigner worked continu-
o usly, with all kinds of new-fangled i
machines, producing far more from
the earth than his wants required, be
cause he wished to market the surplus
and make money. He has been seen
thus shaking his head In pity, not un
mingled with contempt, at ' such folly,
, for the Boer Is not a money-maker.
|He does not want a b*ank account. So
!he drives his slow-moving ox wagon
! away on the hot and dusty trek, mcdi
i tating on the want of faith these Uit
i landers have, who cannot trust the
j future to God and be content with to
! day.
He dines heartily at noon and sups
! heartily at evening. His day hardly
differs from that of any farmer in
any country, only, if he sings at his
work, it is likely to be a psalm that
he sings. He smokes a great deal
while he goes aboutâ a habit derived
! from his forebears in Holland. He is
fortunate in having no winter â no
frost, no snow, only the dry season
when his cattle suffer and the rainy
season when the rivers and ponds are
flooded.
His house and barns are low and
j roomyâ furnished as to the
house rooms. The great feather bed is
usually the most noticeable feature, un
' less, perhaps, he glories in a little har
| monium for his daughter to pick out
hymn tunes of a Sunday. Just before
1 the sun goes down, at a time which var
j ies very little all the year around, the
I Boer calls his family together, and they
have household prayers and pious sing
ing. No lights are needed, or if one is
| it is an old-fashioned lanthorn, or, more
I likely, a rush dip floating in a cup of
! home-made tallow. Ere the daylight
has fairly gone the farmer has bolted
I the door and everybody is in bed.
Three or four times a year he goes to
Nachtmaal, which is equivalent to the
Scotch "Fast day or communion. In
the little market square of the nearest
little burg there will stand a modest
whitewashed building like a barn. This
is the church of the district, and here
at stated periods the farmers gather
from all about. â  They -don't take their
families to hotel, though some may stay
with friends, but drive the two or three
days' journey in the big white-can
vassed wagon, drawn -by from twelve
to sixteen fat, wide-horned oxen. They
make camp near the town, in a meadow
probably by the stream, and live in
and under the wagon during the Nacht
maal, cooking for themselves the food
they have brought along. The congre
gation gathers, during this time, day
and evening. Their neighbors meet be
tween whiles â¢ and gossip and perhaps
transact a little business. They would
not belong to the human family if, of
course, the lads and lassies did ' not
walk and exchange vows. These are
the great outings, the picnics, of the
year, and small tradesmen and Jew
peddlers are on hand with knickknacks
and trumpery to sell to the young folks,
so that, outside the services, the meet
ing is a kind of fair. Sometimes also
there may be a wrestling match or
jumping match between young men, in
which all, old and young, will take a
deep interest. . . *
Although the Boer has proved that
he can be longheaded and shrewd in
political and other grave matters in
some of the ordinary matters of life he
is remarkably simple. There are many
stories told of his unsophisticated ways.
A prospector for gold found signs of it
on a farmer's land, and, after great
effort, succeeded in buying the portion
he desired. A check cm a bank In Pre
toria was offered in payment, but ths

extra weight, the balloon rose slightly
for a minute, then began to sink more
rapidly than ever. I thought of my para
chute. It was at home. I thought of
everything. But what can a man do when
a burst balloon is above him and he is
dropping to earth in his basket?
I looked down again. The steeple was
taking form. Its ribbed sides showed tiny
windows and through the top one I fan
cied I could see the bell. In my hand was
still the pencil with which I had made my
record, and, taking it between my fingers,
in a cold clutch I wrote the words, "I am
dying happily. I have reached my term.
Science triumphs." There was time for no
more. In the new horror of the situation
taking on momentarily newer and more
awful phasesâ l saw my end. There be
fore me stretched an open lake. To fall
in it would mean death by drowning, for
I could not hope to save myself with the
ropes so twisted around me!
The lake was still a little way off, but
the car was heading for it.
There was no alternative now. Though
ready for death, I must escape if I could.
We were low enough now to see the
houses well, and I resolved as we were
passing over the city to make a Jump. It
was my only hope.
I cannot tell now why I did it, but I
involuntarily reached in my pocket and
stopped my watch. It had pointed to ex
actly 2 o'clock when I was taking my ob
servations at the time the balloon burst.
What time lt was now I could not tell,
but to Judge from my impressions we had
been two hours in falling. -Taking my
hand off my watch I climbed to the edge
of the basket and waited. On we sped,
dropping into the city; now we were over
a public square; people were beginning
to look up at us. There was an open
grass plat. Now would be the time to
Jump.
Closing my eyes I gathered my legs in
under me and made the leap. Next thing
I knew I was lying on the grass, with
people bending over me, and pouring
whisky down my throat. A stinging sen
sation in my left arm and leg told me I
was hurt.
Well, next day, when I had recovered
my senses enough to ask questions, they
told me that I had landed on the grass
plat and that my only injuries were a
wrenched leg and a sprained arm.' Small
indeed for a man who falls 10,000 feet!
On looking at my watch I found that I
had been exactly two minutes in falling,
the enormous weight of the ballast before
I threw it out having made my descent
the swiftest on record.
. farmer had never been inside a bank
! and did not know what a check was.
He would take nothing but gold, and
cold, a considerable amount, . was
' finally handed over to him. The cx
i citement of the transaction over, and
i his bewilderment at possessing so much
I wealth past, the farmer began to fear
i what he had never had to trouble him
| self about before â robbers.
He slept .on his money, and, as he
! could not take it out with him to his
work, he either sat at home watching lt
with a gun, or else had one of his stal
wart sons do the*same. When occasion
demanded that he should visit the
town, he drove in with an armed son.
: and while one of the two did business
in the market place, the other sat on
I the box containing the treasure warn
: ing off all comers. It was only after
! his pastor had reasoned with him for
' months, and then with a great deal of
' doubt and nervous, cautious questions,
â  that he was persuaded to put his for
i tune in the Standard Bank.
So the Boer farmer and hunter pur
sues his even way, as his people have
] ever done, and if (what he considers
the accursed) gold had never been
found in his land, he might so pursue
!it to the end of the chapter. It is to
i be feared, however, that foreign capi
: tal and railroads, and telegraphs and
; lightning-rod agents have broken up
his idyllic life forever, or, rather, will
, soon do so. It was, Is not, however,
all peace. As the American backwoods
: man was continually on his guard
! against Indians, so the Boer is ever
! ready to take the field against a Kaffir
, tribe or â British.
Then the plow and the hoe are laid
! aside and the rifle is cleaned carefully,
but not now for a pleasant hunt after
; game. The call to arms is simple;
mobilization is primitive. It amounts
to little more than if Kruger, or Gen
eral Joubert, were to shout at the top
j of his voice, so that the whole country
; would hear him: "All hands on deck
i for action!" At the warcry the pa
! triots know they have been "com
mandeered." There is no squabbling
about volunteering, or enlisting, or
drafting. Except the women, the very
old and the very young, everybody
responds, even boys of 13 and 14 â but
the average Boer boy is a pretty stout
and healthy kid, and has been taught
to shoot since he was 10 or 11. Each
man takes his horse and his rifle and
proceeds to the rendezvous of the dis
i trict. The pastors are with them, and
| with prayer and psalms the farmer-
I soldiers march out to defend their
J country.
With all his ignorance and unpro
gressiveness, it is difficult to contem
plate the scattering of such a people
with mere philosophic serenity.

WHAT AUTHORS ARE DOING Illustrated Works for the Children IN THE LAND OF BOOKS
IN E. Demou.ih's famous work.
'a - _ ----- Superiority." he teiis
us that one of the chief reasons for
the deterioration of the- French as a
nation is that the children are never
thought of. There is r.o true sympathy
with childish whims and fancies, with the
tender requirements of simple childhood:
There are no children ir. France. They
pass from thÂ£ ..mocehce of babyhood into'
a set sophistication and premature old
womanhood.
He compares the Anglo-Saxon and
French schoolroom, and contrasts the
methods of development used. We are
shown that the French child 'is taught
to suspect and not to know, whereas the
English child is taught to know and never
to suspect. He has told the French peo
ple many a wholesome truth and for his
pains was almost run out of the country.
A year ago I sent to France asking for a
collection of books, pamphlets and other
wise. for young children. Nothing of the
least value wa_s sent but the books of De
Monvel. and they are r.ot for the poor.
If we would build a nation we must look
to the children. We must see that their
books as well as their companions are

The figure is represented is wearing the
very clothes in which Mr. Davis was
dressed .when he was captured by a de
tachment of Michigan cavalry. Mrs.
Davis carefully preserved these inter .st

at Mr. Zolnay's disposal. Indeed, she fur
nished him with all the available mate
training as the text This is pre-emi
nently the age of child literature, ar.d
from the motley output it is difficult to
choose the best. One of the most famous
raters of juvenile books was Ran
dolph Caldeeott. whose early art career
is interestingly described In a personal
memoir by H. Blackburn. He was a
bank clerk in Manchester. England, and
his love for children, his knowledge of
their needs, prompted his work In the field
that has mad. his name beloved. Curi
ously enough, he died in the same year
with Juliana Horatio Ewing. whose series
of delightful book 3he illustrated. Per
haps the most famous is "The Story of a
Short Life." but "Jsr-kanapes" and
"Daddy Darius' Dovecote" find a ready
sale. The Society for the Promotion of
Christian Know-edge in England has is
sued an edition of the books to sell at a
shilling apiece. Caldecott's Panjandrum
picture book is a never-ending delight to
the tiny folks. We must love the children
if we would find the key to their joys.

Probably no book published recently for
children has had a larger sale than Bel
loc's "More Beast! and from my point
of view It is morMd and strained to the
limit of ugliness. The drawings, from the
standpoint of art. are decidedly vulgar,
and it is altogether about as worthless

could find among the popular books of
the day. The children will laugh over it.

is given his environment, and in his ac

Howard Pyle Illustrates his own text
and many are the children who have been
made happier and better by acquaintance
with him. In the preface of "Pepper and
Bait," the giddy fated jester says, "one
must have a little pinch of seasoning in
this lull, weary life of ours one should
never look to have all the troubles, the
labors and the cares, with never a whit

During her recent trip to New York
Mrs. Davis paid many visits to the stu
field of illustration. Hawthorne's "Won
der Book" has a new meaning when bound
with his desicns. and who would purchase
a copy of Grimm's fairy tales without his
magic pictures?
Another 1393 publication is a whimsical

mind, is the verse about Spain, and here
It is:

iike many a famous person was forced
into his field. Illustration was to be merely
a means. of livelihood while greater pro
jects were brewing, but he has become
so notably Identified with the work that
he cannot separate himself from it. "La
Cavilite" tells In the ' simplest way
what is best for little folk's to do. and
when they look at the pictures of naughty
little people side by side with the well
behaved they choose in a trice to be good.
De Mom-el's studies of children's legs
are an Inexhaustible source of amuse
ment to their elders, who are. of course;
hotter able to appreciate the humor of the
thing. All the books?â "La Civilite."
"Jeanne D'Arc," "Chanson? de France,"
"Vellles Chansons" and others of equal
interest â have been carefully translated,
and with his illustrated edition of the
fables of La Fontaine they form almost
a child's library In themselves. De Mon
vel visited America some months ago and
the result of his observaton and study
will no doubt be giver, us In future books.
How few books really furnish the enter
tainment and instruction for which they
are ostensibly bour.d and how careful we
should be that In the purchase of litera
ture for the verj' young we look earnestly
and critically at the Illustrations, for they
far outweigh with them, ln both Interest
and influence, the value of the text. De
Monvel still clings to his desire for
greater things, and as a result has a por
trait In this year's salon. Whatever fame
his work in portraits may bring him, it
can never carry him away from the
hearts of thousands of children who have
rained so much by the need he had for
the wherewithal to live. And what great

children to one day find 'he best that life

The nineteenth century Is looked upon as
a period of transition in fiction, no school
seeming to obtain. The idealistic novel
is written of as quite out of date, the
naturalistic as fast losing hold upon the

seems to predominate; nevertheless the
horizon of the novel writer is generally
narrowed down to dissolute and Idle Pa
risian society.

This is the fourth of a series of revival
sermons by the same author, who is most
prolific in revival literature. The bock
contains thirty or more sermons, which
were flrst preached In the Methodist
Episcopal church of Cleveland. Ohio, at
a serie.. of evangelistic meetings. In his
preface the author tells us that "a very
gracious revival of religion was awakened
by their delivery and a large number of
persons were converted and received into
the church as the result." The sermons
are practical in character and full of
well-chosen Illustrative material. The
anecdotes are always exactly relevant to
the moral lesson to be taught and help
to give the sermon a hold upon the mem
cry and the heart. The titles of the ser
mons, too, are chosen with a view to find
ing readers. Here are a few: "Loves
Easy Harness." "A Prosperous Soul," A
Candlestick ln Danger. "The Bright
Heart of the Universe," and "The Poorest
People in the World." In "A Candlestick
in Danger", we are told: "Anything that
is applicable to the church, as a church,

while the church is represented as a great

ON THE BIRDS' HIGHWAYâ By Regi
nald Heber Howe Jr. Small, Maynard
._ Co.. Bostor. Cloth, illustrated. $2.
The book Is a narrative description of
the habits and ways of our Eastern birds,
personally observed by the author ir. their
various localities and presented to the
reader in a simple, interesting form. He
carries his reader with him through many
of the picturesque bird haunts of Rhode
Island. Maryland. Massachusetts and New-
York, and creates so lively an interest ln
the feathered tribe that a desire for fur
ther study is quickly awakened. His lan
guage is gracefully descriptive and never
â  too elaborate. He closes a chapter on
"Winter Birds" thus: "The sun is sink
ing slowly in the west, the bleak March
wind is driving song sparrow and junco
to cover and the great oaks stand out
against the tinted sky. This last fierce
battle of winter does not suggest the
awakening of spring on the morrow, but
the next moon will shine on a new world,
"While through the veins of earth riots
the ichor of spring."
Of the woodcock he says: How many of
the sportsmen of the Eastern United States,
who consider the woodcock their favorite
game bird, and who have bagged many a
brace, know of or have listened to their
love song? I think we could count them
on our fingers. Their flight song Is one
of the most wonderful of bird utterances,
and sun we are wont to cry out to the
bird as he springs upward again,
"Teach me half the gladness
That thy brain must know.
Such harmonious madness *
From my lips would flow;
The world should listen then
As I am listening now."
The book contains excellent photo
graphic illustrations by the author and a
frontispiece In color from a painting by
Louis Agassis Feurtes. Credit is given to
George R. Shattuck of Boston for certain
species he has allowed the author to add
to the list personally observed. .

by The Emporium.
The book Is a collection of lectures on
"Raja Yoga," the ancient system of In
dian philosophy, and other subjects of
kindred application. Swaml Vlvekananda
was the representative of the Hindu re
ligion at the World's Parliament of Re
ligions held in Chicago in 1593. and became
a familiar figure in several American cit
ies during the three years following the
parliament. His teachings are universal
in their application and only vary in their
details to suit the ldiosyncracy of race and
individual. The book also contains
Patanjali's Yoga aphorisms and a copious
glossary of Sanskrit terms. On a page
before the preface the key to the teach
ings of the text is thus given:
"Each soul is positively divine.
"The goal is to manifest this divinity
within by controlling nature, external and
internal.
"Do this either by work, or worship, or
psychic control, or philosophy, by one or
more or all of these, and be free.
"This is the whole of religion. Doctrines
or dogmas, or rituals, or books, or tem
ples, or forms, are but secondary de
tails."
We are told that "a Yogi must avoid
the two extremes of luxury and austerity.
He must not fast or torture his flesh; he
who does so cannot be a Yogi; he who
fasts, he who sleeps much, he who works
too much, he who does no workâ of

COMILLE FLAMMARION, THE
CELEBRATED FRENCH AS
TRONOMER, FOR YEORS A
PILLAR OF MODERN SPIR
ITUALISM, GOES BOCK TO
HIS FORMER SKEPTICISM.
THERE ls no scientific problem of
the century more complex in its na
ture and more baffling to all at
tempts at solution than that pre
sented by the recent change of at
titude of Camlllc Flammarion and
Professor Hy.lop toward what is ordi
narily known as spiritualistic phenom
ena. __ . __
Flammarion. the famous French as
tronomer who two years since becameâ
after years of extraneous and perfectly
unprejudiced investigation of medlumlstic
manifestations-one of the strongest pil
lars of modern spiritualism, and Profes
sor Hyslop of Columbia College. Wash
ington. D. Câ who has been noted for
his somewhat intolerant skepticism in the
premisesâ have almost simultaneously
changed places.
The French scientist, who after his con
version through the instrumentality of
Eusapia Paladino. gave to the world nu
merous works which he has firmly be
lieved were written under the guidance
of a deceased astronomer communicating
with him under the name of "Lumen"
through a medium In whom he had the
greatest faith, has announced unequivo
cally that he has gone back to his pre
vious state of unbelief.
The college professor, who has been
from his youth a pronounced skeptic in
all such matters and was only by much
persuasion induced to countenance the
idea of possibly existing supernatural
forces to the extent of becoming a mem
ber of the Society for Psychical Research,
has almost at the same moment an
nounced his conversion to the belief that
there Is a life beyond the grave, and
that the spirits of those departed are not
only conscious, but are capable of hold
ing intelligent communication with us
who still remain in this material world.
The dual aspect of the position of these
two stars in the intellectual firmament
is a strange one indeed. Both being men
of unusual brain power and of position
high enough to give assurance that they
express only their own honest convictions,
utterly uninfluenced by any material con
siderations whatever, Their exchange of
beliefs has had no real effect upon the
equation over which humanity is forever
puzzling in a more or less vain effort to
find the unknown quantity.
The defection of the astronomer, which
would ordinarily have been considered a
most serious blow by all the adherents to
the spiritualistic belief, is quite compen
sated for, in their estimation, by Professor
Hyslop's most unexpected desertion from
the ranks of their enemies. The divine
religion of true spiritualism, say they,
though sorrowing for the backslider, has
really lost nothing by the transaction.
The story of the conversion and retro
gression of the one scientist and the un
willing convlncement of the other is an
interesting one not only to those who feel
vitally concerned as to the truth or falsity
of spiritualism's claims, but also to those
who look upon the whole question with
calmly impartial eyes.
Camllle Flammarion's reputation is
world wide. Born in Haute-Marne fifty
seven years ago. he was educated for the
priesthood, but never took the vows. In
stead of thus securing for himself a sure
place in a spiritual heaven, he felt more
drawn toward the work of solving, as far
as in him lay. the mysteries of the ma
terial heaven which surrounds his earthly
home: and. therefore, as soon as he was
able to do as he wished, he enrolled him
self as a pupil at the Paris Observatory.
That he had perfectly diagnosed his own
qualifications and capabilities was soon
made clear by his rapid advance in the
mastery of his chosen science, and before
he reached the age of 30 he had delivered
several series of lectures on astronomy
which attracted the attention and com
mendation of the entire scientific world.
It was he who first /suggested the prac
ticability of the use of balloons in the
study of upper atmospheric strata, and
his maps Illustrative of this subject have
never yet been improved upon in any
way: while his books on various astro
nomical subjects are used as guides by
many other renowned students of the
wonders of the firmament.
Practical as was and is his strictly pro
fessional career, Flammarion has always
been peculiarly drawn toward the realm
of mysticism and speculation. Of a tem
perament almost Oriental in its charac
teristics, he from childhood was possessed
BANK DEFUNCT FOR TWENTY
YEARS PAYS DEBTS AND
LARGE DIVIDENDS.
nORE than twenty years ago the
Third National Bank of Chicago
formally closed Its doors and
a receiver was appointed. To
day this stock is held at
nearly double its par value; and it is
regarded as "gilt-edged" security. With
in five years, although the bank has re
ceived no deposits, made no loans, issued
no currency, sold no drafts, it has paid
two substantial dividends to its stock
holders and promises many more. More
over, it is unique in being a corporation
having large assets and no liabilitiesâ
beyond the obligation to its stockholders.
The circumstances which led up to
these peculiar, even unprecedented con
ditions, make a story probably without
parallel in the annals of national bank
nsrior to the panic of 1873 the Third Na
tional Bank ranked as one of the stanch
est financial institutions in the West. It
had a capitalization of $750,000 and its di
rectory Included some of the most prom
inent names in Chicago â such men as
George M. Pullman, J. Irving Pearce. Jo
seph Medill. C. H. Curtis, C. M. Hender
son C. R. Steele, John H. Thompson,
William T. Allen and S. S. Benjamin.
When the financial crisis of 1873 was at
its height the Third National Bank sus
pended payment for a single week as a
precaution against a threatened run.
Then it opened again and prepared to re
sume its old place in the business world.
But a bank Is like a man. It is trusted
implicitly until it reveals some inherent
weakness. ___.___._. __
The Third National Bank had the finest
officers ln Chicago, the largest force of
clerks, the longest list of country corre
spondents, but it also had the single slip
from the path of financial rectitude to
live away. Some of Its officers, knowing
the need of unusual efforts to maintain
Its business supremacy, signed the bonds
of the Treasurer of Cook County, thereby
receiving large deposits of the public
money to swell the quarterly reports. The
bank also appeared as the main deposi
tory of a Board of Park Commissioners,
of which its president had become the
treasurer. Other bankers, looking on, saw
the signs and understood them.
In 1873 the deposits exceeded $4,000,000,
but they kept creeping down until late in
1877 they were only $1,164,000.
In September, 1877. an extensive hotel
property owned by President Pearce and
one of the other directors was destroyed
by fire It had no connection with the
bank, and yet the bank felt the shock.
A few weeks later President Pearce called
on the New York correspondent of his
bank and asked for a temporary loan to
be used in case the heavy deposits of

by a vague yearning after the seemingly
unknowable ln life here and hereafter.
Strangely enough, though, he never al
lowed his temperamental desires to influ
ence or cloud his judgment. His self^
recognition of his mystical tendencies
made him, indeed, particularly discrimi
nating and critical under all circum
stances that appealed to the other side
of his dual nature.
Earnestly desirous always of journey
ing beyond the limit of ordinary human
knowledge, he yet insisted upon going
every step of the way upon solid ground
and with his very bright and observing
eyes wide open. He was always seeking
information and looking for new light,
but the slightest shadow of fraud or hy-
pocrlsy was sufficient to disgust him, and
his peculiar investigative methods and his
intolerance of sham made him dreaded
by all the so-called mediums whom he
chose to honor with his personal atten
tion.
Much interested at first by the "won
derful Buguet," whose photographic neg
atives bore impressions of the spirits of
the dead, he soon declared publicly: "I
have with my own eyes caught sight of
his (Buguet's) previously prepared
plates."
The famous medium, Slade, came very
near making him a convert, but he pur
sued his Investigations so unremittingly
that one day he announced that he not
only had detected him writing beneath
the table on a concealed slate, but had
also given him a very simple task which
he had been unable to perform. Admiral
Mouchez, director of the Paris Observa
tory, had. together with Flammarion,
sealed together two slates with observa
tory paper in such a way that if tam
pered with the fraud could not have been
disguised, and Slade had been obliged,
after having them ten hours in his pos
session, to return them unwritten on.
Such experiences, while they did not
lessen Monsieur Flammarion's eagerness
to know more of the mystic side of life
and death, naturally increased his skep
ticism as to humanity's power in the
premises. He declared himself not only
open to conviction, but more than desir

public money should be withdrawn sud
denly, and the New York bank hesitated
and hedged.
On President Pearce's return to Chicago
he found that some of the directors of the
bank were losing confidence ln Its ability
to meet the demands which might be
made upon it.
In spite of the loss of confidence, there
was no regular run on the bank, and yet
it was suffering from a wasting disease
known to financiers as a "vest pocket
run." Depositors drew out their money
and it was not replaced. A St. Louis paper
printed a brief telegram hinting at the
condition of the bank and every mall
brought drafts that helped to drain its
reserve.
One day the County Treasurer gave
notice that he would want a half million
dollars. He was very agreeable about lt,
but he must have the money. He, too,
had heard the rumors and he must protect
himself.
A half-million dollars is a very large
sum of money to ask instantly from any
bank's reserve cash. The officers of the
Third National Bank ran here and there
for help, thereby spreading the odium of
their distress. The First National Bank,
fearing a general financial disaster,
agreed to lend a helping hand if the
Union National Bank would do the same.
The Union National Bank, after question
ing and delaying, agreed by its president,
W. F. Coolbaugh. to advance $300,000 in
case of emergency. With this money and
other promised assistance, President
Pearce was sure that he could make his
bank stand any strain. The First Na
tional Bank was ready to do anything in
its powerâ it only awaited a formal re
quest. Other banks also expressed their
friendliness.
One hundred and fifty thousand dollars
of the borrowed money was to be deliv
ered on November 14. That morning Pres
ident Coolbaugh was found dead at the
foot of the Douglas monument with a bul
let hole ln his temple. His bank, fearing
for its own safety, refused to advance the
promised money. The First National
Bank followed its example. New York long
since had refused a friendly handâ
the Third National Bank found itself
deeper than ever in the meshes of mis
fortune. ':-.%: .'..
About this time. the Park Commission
ers discovered suddenly that there was a
large block of bonds not yet due which
they could pay. Of course they wished to
save the interestâ and they withdrew
more than $200,000 all In one day.
On October 1 the bank had cash re
sources amounting to $966,530 with total

Paladino made her abearance in the
spiritualistic world tha!* he declared him
self subjugated.
Eusapia Paladino was a small trades
woman residing in Naples in the early
part of the present decade. She was an
Illiterate person, unable to read or write,
and with absolutely no ideas outside the
dull routine of her small business and
daily life, but she developed, quite unas- p
sisted, an apparently mediumistlc power V
which made her for some years one of
the greatest wonders of the age.
She was a woman of ordinary appear
ance, rather small, of dark complexion,
40 years of age, and of somewhat phleg
matic temperament. A woman neither
brilliant of intellect nor even commonly
educated, she yet managed to utterly con
fuse and puzzle some of the most eminent
scientists of our century, such as Lom
broso, Schlaparelll, Darieux, Charles
Richet and the Comte de Rochas, and

assets of $3,910,891. By November 21 the
cash had shriveled away to $283,903, and
the total resources to $2,742,907.
On November 21 the Clearing House
Association wrote Its death warrant, and
Jackson, showed that the nominal assets
were about $1,800,000 and the debts were
nearly $1,000,000, leaving a nominal $800,000
to pay the stock liability of $750,000. On
paper this looked most encouraging, but
a close examination showed that there
was too much "slow" paper and not
enough "short."
Of the real estate, one tract of a hun
dred acres lay on a barren sand ridge near
the lake shore and nearly ten miles south
east of the City Hall. Another tract of
forty-five acres was nearly as far to the
west of the city on the bare flat prairie,
where there was little prospect of Its ever
being anything more than a cabbage
patch. Still another piece of property lay
far out in the southwestern portion of the
city, and it seemed to some of the ninety
stockholders that it would hardly pay
the bank to retain Its property and meet
the expenses of management. _? ' Â
But the receiver was a man of wide
resources and unbounding faith, and had
faith In Chicago.
Three months after the closing of the
bankâ on Janury 31. 1878â the depositors
received a dividend of 45 per cent. . A
month later 10 per cent more was paid,
and before the close of 1879 35. per cent
more had been distributed, and the re

dends of 5 per cent each before the close

make a complete convert of the eminent
and previously invincible Camille Flam
marion.
In company with M. and Mme. Block
and the two daughters of M. de Fontenay
and M. Koechlin, Flammarion attended a
seance given in the Bleck parlors by
Eusepia, who was their guest at the time.
The Blecks were earnest searchers after
truth and very anxious to observe the
medium's manifestations in surroundings
and under circumstances which would
preclude any possibility of the woman
receiving the slightest assistance in her
work from any material outside source.
During this meeting the medium sat at
the end of a common kitchen table be
tween M. Flammarion and M. de Fonte
nay, M. Bleck and his two daughters oc
cupying the other seats, while Mme. Bleck
and Mme. Koechlin sat on a sofa facing
the table, about six feet away.
At the end of three minutes the table
moved. A minute later It rose entirely
off the floor and remained for two seconds
suspended six inches above it. Two flash
light photographs taken on the Instant
show that this was an actual fact and not
a physical or mental illusion.
During the evening Flammarion felt a
hand passing through his hair, his chair
was violently pulled and shaken and his
ears sharply pinched. The table at the
conclusion of the seance was in full light,
raised twenty Inches from the floor *a.nd
remained suspended for five seconds.
As Flammarion kept his right hand on
Eusapia's knees and held her left hand
ln his left while his feet were placed firm
ly on hers and M. de Fontenay held her
right hand he was firmly convinced that
here at last was a medium who had some

the face value of their claims. A year
later they received their interest in full

five years after the close of the bank, with
a score of pieces of expensive real es
tate, most of which had comparatively
little present cash value, and a quantity
of doubtful claims and costly lawsuits,
the legacy of the panic. ."
At the time of the bank's failure Chi
cago's population scarcely exceeded 4.0,
--000, and there was no reason for arguing
that in twenty years' time it would be the
second city in the country, with a popula
tion of more than 1.700,000. with real estate
appreciated in value on a scale commen
surate with the growth of the city.
In July, 1891, the receiver made the

thing besides natural forces at her com
mand.
In writing of this evening's experience
afterward he summed up his impressions
and convictions as follows:
"I believe we can affirm the undoubted
existence of unknown forces capable of
moving matter and of counteracting the
action of gravity. It is a combination dif
ficult to analyze of physical and psychic
forces. But such facts, however extrava
gant they may appear, deserve to enter
the domain of scientific Investigation, and
It is even probable that they may power
fully contribute toward the elucidation of
the problemâ us supremeâ of the na
ture of the human soul.'*
This seance was but the beginning of
a series which led Flammarion gradually
but surely from the foregolnr qualified
admission of the existence of supernor
mal powers to not only a firm belief ln
the existence and consciousness of the
soul after death, but an equally flrm be
lief In the possibility of the soul's return
to the plane of this world and Its power
to communicate more or less directly
with still living beings.
In fact, Flammarion became a spirit
ualist of the most advanced and earnest
type, and although he was subjected to
the severest criticism by the world at
large for his change of opinion and was
indeed ridiculed by many, he persisted in
declaring that he had at last found the
truth and was content with it. He be
came a member of the English Society
for Psychical Research and organized a
circle, or investigation society, of seven
teen members, all men of his own nation
ality and of high social or scientific
standing.
He carried his spiritual beliefs and
theories into the practicalities of his life
also, for after his conversion he wrote
several books which he stated were really
the dictated works of disembodied spirits..
All cf them, however, were of such a na
ture as to add to Flammarion's own repu
tation as a scholar and a thinker in the
estimation even of those who regarded
with disfavor his spiritualistic views and
declarations.
And now, after years spent in the quiet
harbor of satisfying and happy belief;
after years spent in endeavoring to induce
other storm-tossed mariners on the raging
ocean of Doubt to come and anchor be
side him. Camille Flammarion has put
up sails and gone straight out to sea
again. fy.ff-i
He has discovered, he says, that the
harbor was full of shoals and hidden
rocks, and that he was utterly deceived
by the pilots who towed his bark there
to. There is no safety there, he affirms,
but instead are dangers worse than those
of the open main, however stormy, be
cause they are secret and hidden under
the deceitful smoothness of treacherously
quiet waters.
He had found flaws in the ostensible
communications from the other world,
and while he does not dispute the .xist
ence of all occult phenomena he gives no
further credence to the assertion that
stockholders an offer of $1,000,000 for the
despised 100 acres of land, and the stock
holders rejected it. In a manner hardly
less remarkable the forty-flve-acre cab
bage patch became valuable. Car lines
passed it, the suburb of Oak Park grew
out around it, and ever.- year has added
thousands of dollars to its value.
Under the receiver's care the bank has
been as marvelously fortunate as it was
unfortunate while it was still In the hands
of the directory.
In 1898 the receiver 'was able to pay a
dividend of 10 per cent, to the stockhold
ers, and he followed it ln 1595 with a sec
ond dividend of 5 per cent.
When the receiver had finished the pay

required him to resign in favor of an

As he made public his conversion to the
belief in spirit existence, return and com

later conviction that it was all a wretc ted

its highest capacity.
Always skeptical of everything which
was not susceptible of material demon
stration, did not agree with known nat
ural laws, or honestly own that its only
foundation for existence was simple faith,
Professor Hyslop decided some time since
to join the American Society for Psychical
Research, his motive seeming to be at the
time to lend his best endeavors to the
unmasking of charlatanry and the ex
posing of what he. considered the auda
cious humbug of spiritual seances.
Being an earnest man In all things. Pro
fessor Hyslop devoted himself lndefat-
Igably to the work he had taken up. and
soon became one of the most executive
and efficient members of the organization
in the work of which all the civilized
world is deeply Interested. His attitude
of mind was such that he could not be
easily deceived even by the most expert
tricksters. But at last Professor Hyslop,
like his distinguished fellow searchers
after facts beyond the seas, discovered a
medium who met and refuted all his ob
jections to the belief of which she ls the
exponent, and made him a convert .here
to. What Eusapia Paladino waa to
Camllle Flammarion, Mrs. Piper of Bos
ton now is to Professor Hyslop. She ls
his Moses, leading him out of the wilder.
ness of skepticism into the happy land
of certainty and peace.
Mrs. Piper herself enjoys the distinc
tion of being one of the most phenomenal
mediums of the century. She is what is
known as a "trance" medium, and has so
far shown extraordinary powers In her
own peculiar line. In the early years of
her trances her voice was usually con
trolled by a personality who went under
the self-given name of "Doctor Prinuit."
but for some time past she has seemed
Independent of his influence and different
persons have spoken through her In a
manner to puzzle even the most stubborn
of unbelievers.
The communications received through
Mrs. Piper, which have been of the most
value, are ostensibly from George Pel
ham, at one time an enthusiastic member
of the Psychical Research Society, who
met an accidental and instantaneous
death in the city of New Tork in Febru
ary 1592. He was a lawyer by training,
but devoted himself chiefly to literature
and philosophy. Boston had been his
home during nearly all his lifetime, but
for the three years just preceding his
death he had been a resident of New
Tork.
Always Interested, as all Intelligent per
sons are, in the question of possible fu
ture life, young Pelhamâ was but 32
when he was killedâ often discussed the
matter with his friends, always, how
ever, taking the position that such a hy
pothesis was not only incredible, but in
conceivable. About two years previous to
his decease, however, he made a solemn
vow that if he died before his friend Dr.
Hodgson and found himself "still ex
isting" he would certainly return. If it
were possible, and let him know the truth
of the matter.
That promise Dr. Hodgson and Pro
fessor Hyslop. and many others who were
previously anti-spiritualists, firmly believe
he kept four weeks after his sudden tak
ing off, and has been keeping ever since.
On March 22, 1592, while Dr. Hodgson
and Mr. James Hart, a warm personal
friend of the dead lawyer, were sitting
with Mrs. Piper, she began to speak with
the voice of George Pelham, and after
greeting them warmly proceeded to de
clare in the strongest terms the fact of
an after existence and explained the man
ner in which he awakened to its reality.
Later Professor Hyslop, also a friend
of Mr. Pelham, received communications
from him which have had the effect of
uprooting the convictions of a lifetime,
and have brought him Into the positive
belief that the actual spirit of the lawyer
hasXbeen able to return and has told htm
Important truths concerning the world
beyond this.
The medium while in her trances has
shown the most perfect and intimate
knowledge of the life of George Pelham,
and has always recognized persons at her
sittings who are utter strangers to her
self but who had known or met George
Pelham in life, calling them instantly by
their names and telling them of circum
stances known only to themselves and
him. Every friand of Pelham who has
talked with her under these circum
stances has been entirely satisfied that
it is his own active personality which
carries on the conversation.
Professor Hyslop, astonishing as the
whole affair was to him, was not easily
persuaded of its scientific truth. He at
tended Mrs. Piper's seances from time to
time for a period of several years, and
always In an interrogative and doubting
rather than a receptive spirit. But at
last his prejudices have been conquered
and his determined will vanquished. He
has become convinced not only of the pos
sibility, but of the certainty of a spiritual
existence and of direct spiritual commun
ication, and he declares that henceforth
his mission Is to be to spread with tongue
and pen the knowledge that has come to
him so clearly and irrefutably, and has
brought with it so much of solace and of
joy.
Professor Hyslop, the thinker and edu
cator, has found and rejoices over what
Camille Flammarion, tne scientist, has
cast aside as worthless.

It is a settlement which has grown
with almost the rapidity of a mining
camp, where the fortunate first-com
ers have been unselfish enough to.an
nounce that they have "struck it rich."
Six months ago in this locality the
ever-shifting sand mounds lay bare ar.d
-smooth along the line of shore, un
marked by human habitation save a
roadside refreshment place or two, and
one house of a style of architecture so
odd as to make it a special object of in

Street cars of the type superseded by
cable and trolley were the foundation
of this residence, which was the practi

progressive physician who was and is a
firm believer in the efficacy of sand
baths in assuaging divers ills of poor
humanity.
Two of the large "double-enders"
which used to bear amusement -seekers

as dining hall and kitchen, formed a
nucleus around which has been built a
commodious summer cottage, which.
painted white and surrounded by a bit
of garden coaxed into being in spite of
sandy discouragement, forms a gra

To own or rent a house at the sea

charming than to live under the hos

agreeable of seaside bonifaces. but
houses in desirable localities, whether
owned or rented, usually come high.
When, however, one can, without going
through the agonies of house-hunting
or the miseries of house-buildir.g, order
a cozy yet commodious "hand-me
down" residence one day and have it
delivered on the lot the next, ready for
occupancy, one of the problems of civ
ilization seems to have been solved.
A mild boom in sandy real estate and
discarded street cars followed public

MIMIC OCEAN FOR EXPERIMENTING WITH MODELS OF UNCLE SAM'S BATTLESHIPS
HO?, over fifteen years Rear Admiral
Hichbofn. Chief of the Construc
tion Bureau of the navy, has been
endeavoring to secure the building
of an experimental naval basin.
He was sent abroad by Secretary Chan
dler as far back as ISS_ to see what im
provements had been devised In shipbuild
ing by other countries, and came back
with the idea for this in his brain. But
it was not until the close of the Fifty
fourth Congress , hat he was able to se
cure an appropriation of the necessary
$130,000 to put his plans into operation.
The need of such tanks has been recog
nized abroad for a still longer time, but
the Governments have hesitated to go
into it sufficiently to attain the - est re-
Bults. William Denny, the most progres
sive of the Scotch builders and the owner
of the only private basin In the world,
said recently in discussing the question:
"Of all the problems about a steamship,
the only ones incapable of being solved at
the present moment by a priori method
are those relating to speed and power.
Nn ability and no energy will ever enable
even the most skillful naval architect to
overcome the want of an mental
tank in coping with these questions."
It is to find out this ideal hullâ the one
that will attain the maximum result of
speed, of carrying power or of whatever
other quality that may be desiredâ that
the United States has erected, after many
years of solicitation on the part of the
Bureau of Construction and Repair, this
enormous basin.
The basin was authorized by Congress
two years ago. .-._ already partial experi
ments have been made with a model of
th"- lowa, and the basin has been proved
to be thoroughly accurate ln Its predic
tions in regard to speed. Very soon ex
haustive experiments will be begun to
determine the best shapes for the hulls
of the new "warships authorized last
March.
The tank has a length of 500 feet, and
along each of Its long sides is laid a
railway on which runs a "towing car

With a grown daughter to support
and numerous other calls upon her
generous but slender purse, this lady
had yet managed to save enough out
of her earnings to buy a soul of the

prove to have been a profitable invest

thought of its present possibilities.
When; however, It became impossible
to collect the moneys justly due her
from the city; and the question of pay
ing rent out of an invisible income be
came a serious one. the teacher took a
Saturday car ride out to the Cliff House
with a vague idea of putting up a tent
on the one spot of earth that she couid
call her own. and living there In primi
tive fashion until right conquered might
and she cam: into her own.
She came back to the city with a new
idea which she had gathered by the
wayside, and she put that idea into ex
ecution without delay. From the win
dow of the eiectric car she id seen the
house of the disciple of Esculaplus nest.
line among the sand hills, and the sight
had been an inspiration.
A day or two later another car made
its unwilling appearance in the soli
tude of the sands, and then on the next
Saturday an express wagon came from
the city loaded with a few simple arti
cles of furnishing ami a fiat-topped
trunk, and on the next car out came the
teacher and her daughter and took pos
session of their new- home. There was
r.o rent to pay now. nd for a little
while the heroic daughter bravely sold
papers to heip out household expenses
and the mother's necessary car fare to

erative. work. These two live in Car
ville still, but under happier auspices
and their home, beautified inside and
out by the exercise of woman's wit and
wisdom, is one of the "show spots" of
the locality â a monument to the re
sourceful bravery of a thoroughly inde
pendent and self-reliant human being.
The two houses made a brave show
ing from boulevard, beach and car line
and awakened envy in many an erst
while peaceful and city-contented
breast, and soon the tide of urban emi
gration turned that way.
At first the plain and simple car.
made stationary by certain mysterious
â to the lay mmd â bracings and com
plications of timbers, was considered
perfectly satisfactory as a residence.
The interior of a street car ls far more
spacious than such persons as have
only tenanted them for purposes of
travel can easily realize.
When one rides on vehicles of this
description only during the crush of
morning and night and holiday the pre
dominant impression retained by the
mind is of their cations rather than
of their true dimensions. A double car.
freed from its late and early tangle of
uncomfortably crowded passengers and
their bristling array of encroaching
knees and elbows ar.d baskets and bun
dles, is a pretty good sized apartment
after all when it comes down to a mat
ter of actual measurement. By a little
arrangement of portieres two people,
and possibly three, can dwell in one
quite conveniently and pleasantly, pro
vided always that they are of amiable
dispositions to begin with, and this fact
has been proven by the Inhabitants of
Carvil!e-by-the-Sea time after time.
At first where the family to be shel
tered was actually too numerous to be
tucked away anywhere inside one car
another was wheeled alongside and an
aristocratic double house was thÂ» ad
mirable result. This idyllic simplicity
of thought expression, however, did not
long satisfy the vaulting ambition of
the progressive beach dwellers. At

When the great weisrht of the carriage

it moves and the perfect control under

In fact, the motor carriage of the model

again and again until the very best shape
for the purpose intended is resolved upon.
When one is finally adopted the resist
ance of the water to its progress at vari
ous speeds will be carefully noted, and
from this it will be very simple to calcu

greatest speed. Hereafter there will be
no danger that the engines will be found

The now old-fashioned span of cars
placed soberly side by side is not par
ticularly popular now, though this
method of arrangement still has Its
conservative adherents. Common vari
ations are cars set tandem fashion,
with a canvas -covered passageway be
tween, and cars set end to end, form
ing three sides of a hollow square, with
a garden, or a chicken yard, or a swing
ing hammock in the sheltered space be
tween.
The prevailing idea, however, seems
to be to see in how many varieties of
ways a car may be used ln the con
struction of a building for either use
fulness or beauty, or both. The curv
ing top of a car, its dashboard and
storm shelter and its rows of sliding
windows, make it ornamental wherever
it may be placed in the construction of
a building once the mind resolutely puts
away the thought of what it really is.
Used as a mansard roof, they lend a
distinct touch of dignity to the plain
board structure beneath. Grouped to
gether and piled upon each other, they
make, with the addition of a little paint,
wonderfully attractive dwelling places,
far and away better, even from a pure
ly artistic standpoint, then the swell
fronted, gingerbread decorated mon
strosities that offend the eye on many
city streets.
and the larger will be her displacement.
For Instance, the coast defense vessel
Monterey, when running at full speed,
plunges her entire bow under the water,
thus offering a much greater surf to
the water and increasing the resistance
to her passage. It is evident that por
tions of the bow which are well out of
water at ten knots the maximum speed
attainable In any of the European tanks
will be submersed entirely at twenty
knots, and that much care should be
taken to design so as to offer the least re
sistance of the upper portion to the water
as is taken with the lower portions,
which are always submersed. Yet never
ln the history of the world has it been
possible to ascertain the best shape for
them in advance of actual test after the
ship has been completed, when, of course,
lt Is too late for alterations.
Objections may be made that the tank
offers, after all. only smooth water facil
ities', and will not give evidence as to work
In a sea way. Such, however, is not the
case. At one end of the tank is to be
placed a powerful propeller, which will
send waves to meet the model quite as
strong proportionately to the size as are
likely to be encountered by the ship in the
open sea. Further, in one corner of the
building which incloses the entire tank
will be placed a powerful electric fan,
which can pet up a very good imitation
of a gale of wind.
Ail these points were worked out very
carefully by Naval Constructor David w.
Taylor before the building of the plant
was begun, and there was theoretically no
doubt that all would work correctly. Still,
careful tests were determined upon to
show that these calculations were accu
rate. In other words, to make everything
perfectly safe, the "sum" had to be
proved."
For this purpose models have been or are
being constructed of the lowa, the Brook
lyn, the Raleigh and other vessels at pres
ent in existence. Abundant records, of
course, exist as to the speed of these act
ual vessels in all sorts of weather and
under all conditions. If when their models
are tested in the tank they should give

At present the machinery is so new that
it is not thought prudent to make too

contemplated ones. It is not proposed to
try any of the latter class for two months

be a public test of the tank and an official
explanation of Its uses. At present the
officers are somewhat close-mouthed in
