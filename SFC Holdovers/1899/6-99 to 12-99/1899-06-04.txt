PARIS. June 3.â The Court
of Cassation to-day rendered
a verdict in favor of a revision
of the Dreyfus case, and order
ing a new court-martial to sit
at Rennes, sixty miles from
Nantes, for the trial of the
prisoner.
PARIS, June 3.â Count EsterhasVe
Bsion that he wrote the Dreyfaa
bordereau has fallen like a thunderbolt
It la true that his word has not
mucb value, in fact, the only doubt
about his authorship of the document
fa that he admits his guilt. At any
i;it-\ nobody bejievea that Dreyfus was
a traitor. I say nobody advisedly.
Those who refuse to admit his inno
cence now are simply bound hand and
foot to their party.
As cabled yesterday, the Cabinet
council decided to placard the lu<dg
ment of the Court of Cassation in all
French communes. This decision has
not yet been made official, but a num
: Deputies intend to move on Mon
day that the Government take this
step. This shows which way the wind
blows, and it is blowing in favor of
Dreyfus' rehabilitation.
Then again, it is fairly certain that
the accusation Âf forgery trumped up
against Lieutenant Colonel Plcauart

cntoc
Dreyfus baa also been informed
that the Court ..f Cassation has de
cided to Bend hie case for retrial before
a ficsh court-martial. This means his
acquittal, and after this is the Question
that is gripping the people's hearts
will the guilty be punished?
Esterhazy has declared to the cor
respondent of the Matin that he will
td himself, teeth and daws. He
declares that he wrote the bordereau
upon the order of Colonel Sandherr.
just as Lieutenant Colonel Henry com
piled the forged proofs of the guilt of
Dreyfus upon command, and he adds.
terribly: "Henry died a victim of his
obedience."
You will remember that Ilenrv was
found dead in a cell in Mont Valerien
fortress on the night his arrest was
reported. He had killed himself, but
sinister rumor has it that both carotid
arteries were cut, which, as a diplo
matist said to me a few days ago, was
one too many for a good suicide. You
will remember that 1 cabled you these
rumors at the time, and Esterhazy's
remarks bring them up again.
When the Matin correspondent asked
Bsterfaasy what he, supposed the gen
erals would say, he replied: "They
will lie, as usual."
What appears certain, however. ia_

that the great washing day is dawn
ing. The judgment of the court was
awaited this afternoon with tense
nerves.
It is said that the majority of the
magistrates have decided that there are
two new facts to be exacted by the law
before any judgment can be revised.
These are, first that the document
"Cc Canaille de D.," which was shown
the court-martial in 1894. and which
decided its verdict, does not apply to
Dreyfus; and, second, that the border
eau, for the writing of which Dreyfus
was convicted, was not written by him
at all.
This reminds one of the Governor of
Calais, who gave thirty-nine reasons
why he hadn't fired a salute, the thirty
ninth being that he had no powder.
THE DECISION THAT
GRANTS A REVISION
PARIS. June 3.â ln the Court of Cas
sation to-day, previous to the an
nouncement of the verdict in favor of
Dreyfus, crowds assembled at the
Palace of Justice and in its neighbor
hood awaiting the decision. Perfect
calm prevailed. The decision, which
was pronounced at ":40 p. m., says the
prisoner is to be re-tried on the follow
ing question:
'â¢Is Dreyfus guilty of having, in 1594,
practiced machinations, or having had
communication with a foreign power
or its agents with a view of facilitating
acts of hostility in the case of a war
with France, or of having provided the
means then-tor by furnishing notes or
documents retraced on the bordereau?"
The audience received the decision
with cries of "Viva la Justice."
When the doors of the Court of Cas-
Bation were opened an immense crowd
of people attempted to rush through the
entrance, and for a time there was
great confusion and uproar. The ses
sion opened at 3 o'clock, when the
president of the court, M. Mazeau, after
reminding the audience that all demon
strations were interdicted, gave judg
ment in the following tenor:
'"The court, after heaving th<- report
of the premier president of the Civil
Chamber, the Public Prosecutor's find
ings, and the application of Maitre
Mornard (counsel Cor Mme. Dreyfus)
under the new article. 443, of paragraph
4, of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
to the effect that a revision of judg
ment can be demanded when new facts
are produced, or documents show
ing the innocence of the con
demned, and in view of the judgment
of October 2f>, 1898, rendered by the
criminal chamber, ordering an inquiry^

of the Dreyfus case unless presented
in proper form, and in view of the re
sults of said inquiry, in view of the
presentation to the court-martial of a
secret document bearing the words
"Cc Canaille de D â ," and seeing that
the communication of this document is
proved by the depositions of M. Casi
mir-Perier, General Mercier and Gen
eral Boisdeffre, and seeing that M.
Casimir-Perier has declared he heard
from General Mercier that the docu
ment bearing the words "Cc Canaille
de D â ," submitted to th.c court-mar
tial, was believed to implicate -Drey
fus, and that in addition Generals Mer
cier and Boisdeffre, who were invited
to say whether they knew If said com
munication had occurred, refused to re
ply, thus acknowledging it; seeing that
by the revelations subsequent to the
verdict the communication to the court
martial of a document capable of in
fluencing their minds and now not
regarded as applicable to Drey
fus, constitutes a new fact cal
culated to establish the inno
cence of Dreyfus; seeing that
the crime charged against Dreyfus
consisted of furnishing the secret docu
ments connected with the national de
fense, accompanying which was a mis
sive styled a bordereau, undated, un
signed and written-on ftligraned paper
which was no longer manufactured,
and that two authenticated letters,
written on the identical paper, dated
contemporaneously with the bordereau,
were discovered in the house of Sster
hazy, the writing upon which experts
have declared to bJ the same as that
of the bordereau, which fact was un
known to the court-martial, tend to es
tablish the innocence of D^eyfua; aee- .

NEW YORK, June 3.â "Grant us in
stant relief or give us independence!"
is the cry of the starving natives of
Porto Rico, according to Drs. Julio
Henna and Zeno Gundis, Porto Rican
Commissioners to Washington.
"The situation has. become intoler
able and the hour of. deliverance can
not be long def<^p*d," they declare.
"Military rule is oppressive and uncon
stitutional. The people are not gov- j
erned by the laws of the United States, j
but are under the sword of a military
Governor, whose dictum is absolute and
without appeal. The islanders are de
nied the rights of citizenship, and
having broken with Spain and not yet
being recognized as citizens of the
United States are a people without a
country. Even the Spaniards on the
island have more rights and privileges.
They can take out papers and become
American citizens, a privilege not ac
corded to the Porto Ricans.
"Instead of absolute free trade be
tween the. United States and Porto
Rico, as on interstate and inter
territorial principles, a high tariff is
kept up, unlawfully and without mercy,
impoverishing the. island, for when the
customs are paid all the profits are
gone.
"Whereas, the people of the island
hailed the advent of their deliverers
from the Spanish yoke with joy and
gratitude, they now feel deeply ag
grieved and enraged at the manner in
which the Government has abused their
rights and privileges and are ready to

GOLD SEEKERS PERISH
At Mud River Settlement a Large
Party of Scurvy- Stricken
Miners Are Starving.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C, June 3.â The Ed
monton trail has been called a '.'trail of
death," and according to the story, or
collection of stones, of privation and
suffering in a vain search for gold and
a desperate struggle by brave men
to get back to civilization, told by the
twenty-nine passengers from the Up
per Cassiar country who arrived by the
Danube, death still lurKs on that trail.
The returned miners tell of death and
disaster, of the finding of dead miners,
of the skeletons lining the trail. They
tell of threatened starvation in the
camps where melancholy and emaci
ated unfortunates are still stalled,
many suffering from Â»curvy and many
from frozen limbs, which some are like
ly to lose by the surgeon's knife as
soon as they can be brought to a camp
where a physician can be found.
At Mud River the greatest number
of unfortunates are to be found. There
starvation is pending and unless the
relief which already has been sent from
Glenora soon arrives the remaining
pack mules and any wandering Siwash
dog or other animal that may be cap
tured are likely to become food for the
men. At least a dozen men are en
camped there, some suffering from
scurvy and others from frostbite.
At McDames Creek and De&se Lake
there are more unfortunates, but there
starvation is not su near: for although
the Hudson Bay post has long since
sold out all its stores, many of the min
ers have still some supplies, which are
being pooled and which will keep them
in food until more arrives.
The returned miners tell of deaths by
drowning,. yn the 'ireat Slave Lake, a
big expahae of wind-swept waters
which has swallowed 'up many unfort
unates owing ti> the capsizing of their
boats since last winter. News is
brought of mysterious disappearances,
in one case a party of ten or twelve
having dropped out of sight com
pletely.
The most disquieting news concerns
the loss of a party of ten or twelve men,
who doubtless have perished in the
now-covered mountains in the vicinity
of Upper Liard post. In December the
party started from Fort Liard for
Upper Hard. The snow was heavy and
traveling conditions dangerous, but the

return the volunteers here as rapidly
as possible the War Department pro
poses to send reinforcements to General
Otis with all dispatch and (,-rders to
the regiments selected will probably be
issued next week. There is no expecta
tion on the part of the authorities that
the insurgents will lay down their arms.
What is expected is that they will en
deavor to recruit thrfr ranks and pre
pare in every possible way for the dry
season, when the grand campaign of
the Americans will occur.
It is the expectation that filibustering
expeditions will now be put under way
for the purpose of getting supplies and
munitions, of war to Aguinaldo, and it
will devolve upon the navy to maintain
an effective patrol. The issuance of a
proclamation declaring a blockade of
the ports Is not for an instant thought
of by the department, but Captain Bar
ker, now commanding the Asiatic
squadron, and his successor, Commo
dore Watson, will take measures for
covering the important harbors and
capturing any vessel which may have
arms and ammunition aboard for the
Filipinos.
A RECORD FOR
GOVERNOR GAGE
TO PONDER OVER
Long List of Predictions
Fully Verified.
ACCURACY OF THE CALL
Appointments, Bad and Indiffer
ent, Published Ahead of Ex
ecutive Announcement.
Governor Gage Is not highly pleased |
with The Call's expose of the extra '
session scheme. In an interview he is
quoted as saying:
"That yarn in The Call to-day
that I intend to call an extra ses
sion is characteristic of the ac
curacy of The Call's statements
relative to my office, and in this
respect I only need to cite the in
correct announcements of the ex
ecutive appointments that paper
has made from time to time."
The record of The Call's announce
ments regarding executive appoint
ments and other affairs connected with
the Governor's office can easily be pro
duced. If the extra session predicted
is as accurate as the predictions were
of executive appointments, the Legis
lature will surely be convened in spe
cial session.
In the first place. The Call named in
advance the entire Republican State
ticket nominated at the Sacramento
convention and predicted the election
of every nominee on the ticket.
Before Gag>- wuv inaugurated Th->
Call announced that W. I. Foley would
be appointee private secretary < tVu-
Governor. He was appointed. .>
On December 2, a month prior to
Gage's inauguration. The Call an
nounced that William H. Davis would
be appointed executive secretary. The
picture of Mr. Davis was printed with
the announcement. Mr. Davis was ap
pointed.
As early as January 2. 1899, The Call
announced that Gage had promised the
j State patronage to promote the elec
tion of D. M. Burns as United Btati I
Senator. On January 7 The Call agal n
asserted that Gage was promising State
patronage to assist Burns.
Before Daniel Kavane and C. J- Fox
were appointed to office by the Gover
nor, The Call published the dispatch
under date of Sacramento, January 3,
1899:
"The law office that was formerly
Henry T. Gage's in the city of Lfls An
geles is now without occupants. The
two remaining attaches of the Ciover
nor's law office arrived in the cky this
morning and soon it is expectei their i
names will be entered upon the payroll
of the State. The two latest arrivals
were Daniel Kavane and C. J. Fox. As
soon as Governor Gage provides for his
stenographer. C. J. Fox, and for his
general factotum. Pan Kavane, he will
have given places to every individual
who had any connection with his law
business in Los Angeles."
Several days after the publication of
this dispatch Fox was appointed sten
ographer of the Governor, which posi
tion he now holds, and Kavane was ap
pointed secretary of the State Board of
Examiners, which place he still occu
pies. Does the Governor challenge the
accuracy of The Call's predicions re
garding the inside patronage?
On June 2, day before yesterday, the
Governor announced that Dr. Payne.
Dr. Barbat, Dr. Keeney and Dr. Coffey
were appointed to constitute tne San
Francisco Board of Health.
On the twelfth page of The Call of
April 29, under the heading, "Gage Se
lects Men for the Board of Health,' the
following was published:
Word went out last night that three
members of the local Board of Health
had been selected and that the others
would Vie named by Monday at the lat
est. The three who have already been
appointed are Dr. Barbat, Dr. W. B.
Coffey and Dr. J. W. Keeney.
Dr. Barbat is- the family physician of
D. M. Burns, while Dr. Coffey is chief
surgeon for the Market-street Railway
Company. Dr. Keeney is a stepson of
Police Commissioner Alvord and is ex
amining physician for the Police De
partment.
Of the aspirants for the remaining
positions on the Board of Health there
are four whose prospects are conceded
to be exceptionally bright. These are
Dr. Henry Meyer, who has been iden
tified with local politics for years and
was at one time chairman of the Re
publican County Committee: Dr. R.
W. Payne, a relative of John I. Sabin
of the telephone company; Dr. Wins
low Anderson, who has long been af
flicted with an ambition .to hold office,
and Dr. W. I. Terry, whose residence
is at the Occidental Hotel.
Politicians who are thoroughly con
versant with the situation will readily
understand that these gentlemen need
have no great cause for anxiety over
the outcome. But the appointment of
Drs. Barbat, Coffey and Keeney is set
tled and there need be no further dis
cussion around the hotel corridors as
to their chances.
The Governor, in the light of the
record, will hardly dispute the charac
teristic accuracy of The Call in respect
to the Board of Health.
The appointment of Martin Aguirre
to the position of Warden at San Quen
tln did not surprise the people of Cali
fornia, but the announcement made on
the seventh page of The Call of Jaau- v
PKICE FIVE CENTS.
ary 19 last that Gage had selected
Aguirre for "Warden to succeed Hale
did cause some astonishment.
Regarding the appointment of Regis
trar of Voters, The Call on March 14,
1899, published a picture of Jake Step
pacher, and below the picture a dis
patch bearing date Sacramento, March
13, was published as follows :
"It Is announced on good authority
that Governor Gage will appoint Jake
Steppacher Registrar of Voters to suc
ceed W. J. Biggy."
The fact that Governor Gage subse
quently caused certain members of the
executive committee of the Republican
State Central Committee to hope and
believe that such a rank appointment
as that of Steppacher for Registrar
would not be made does not in any
sense weaken The Call's characteristic
accuracy.
When Joseph L. Maude was on his
way from Los Angeles to Sacramento
some weeks since and some days be
fore he was appointed Highway Com
missioner The Call predicted that he
would be appointed to that office.
The Call accurately published the
original slate for the Paris Exposition
Commission â M. H. de Young, Mark
L. McDonald and B. C. Truman. Mr.
de Young was offered the place but de
clined to accept it. There was a good
deal of talk about tendering the posi
tion to W. H. Mills, but before definite
steps were taken the programme was
changed by designating a Democrat
from San Francisco, and dropping
Mark L. McDonald {Democrat) of
Santa Rosa to make way for a North
ern California Republican.
The fact that Gage tendered the
office to ex-Mayor E. B. Pond was
mentioned in The Call, and the predic
tion made that W. W. Foote would be
appointed. E. W. Runyon was ap
pointed from Northern California after
it was learned that General N. P. Chip
man would not accept.
The Call has announced accurately in
advance of executive announcement
every important appointment made by
Governor Gage except that of Captain
Seamans for adjutant general. This
appointment was thought to be too bad
for even Gage to make, and The Call
did not predict it.
The appointments for the Code Com
mission have not been announced by
the executive, but The Call predicts
that Gage will appoint his law partner,
Denis of Los Angeles, and W. C. Van
Fleet of San Francisco.
Fully conscious of the fact that Gage
was reputed to be a man of unbounded
couragf, The Call predicted that he
would not have sufficient courage to
reappoint Mose Gunst to the office of
Police Commissioner. The Call's pre
diction was verified. The Governor re
treated behind the provisions of the
law*under which an otflcer may serve
until his successor is elected or ap
pointed. He did not have the courage
to appoint Mose, but allowed him to
serve.
Since the statement published exclu
sively in The Call to the effect that
U. S. Grant had withdrawn from the
Senatorial contest has been verified by
Grant himself, this paper is prepared
to make another characteristic an
nouncement, to- wit:
Governor Gage will call an extra
session of the Legislature as soon as
he is convinced that D. M. Burns can
be elected to the United States Senate.
Notwithstanding Gage's repeated de
nials, The Call during the last session
of the Legislature predicted that the
patronage at the disposal *of the ex
ecutive was to be used to-Jfceward the
supporters of D. M. Burns. Were not
The Call's predictions correct? Can
you. Governor Gage, dispute the ac
curacy of The Call's statement in this
respect?
In conclusion. The Call predicts that
Governor Gage will make some more
bad appointments, but none worse than
he has made, and will retire from of
fice the most unpopular man that ever
sat in the Governor's chair?

NEW YORK, June 3.â lnterest in the
coming Fitzsirnmons-Jeffries fight will
be Increased by James J .Corbett's an
nouncement made to-night that he is
convinced Jeffries will win. Corbett
seemed willing to support his belief in
the boilermaker with cash. He offered
to back Jeffries for any amount, pro
viding odds of two to one were . given
by Fitzsimmons' admirers.
"I have always had confidence in
Jeffries' ability as a fighter," said Cor
bett. "The only thing I feared about
Jim was that he might lose his confi
dence as the date of battle drew near.
Now that I know he is absolutely con
fident of success, 1 have no hesitation
in backing him."
"How do you figure Jeffries a winner
over a man with Fitzsimmons' ring '
record?" was asked.
"Easily enough," said Corbett. "I
have never considered Fitzsimmons a
clever man. He is a slugger and de
pends entirely on his strength to win.
I outpointed him easily enough, but I
am not a strong man. Jeffries is a much :
stronger man than 1 am. He can hit a
much harder blow than I ever could. :
Nature has been kind to him. He is
naturally a strong fellow, unlike any .
man Pitzsimmons has ever fought."
Do you believe Jeffries is a cleverer
man than FitzÃimmons?" j
"Yes, I do," replied Corbett, with em
phasis. "I have sparred with both
men, and I think I ought to know. :
Jeffries can slug just as well as, and hit
harder than, Fitzsimmons. I'll bet Fitz
will stop slugging before Jeffries does."
Evidently believing he is still quali
fied to battle successfully against
heavyweight pugilists of the first class,
"Kid" McCoy announces he will be at
the ringside on Friday night to chal
lenge the winner of the Fitzsimmons-
Jeffries mill. McCoy left Denver for
New York to-day. He is quoted as say
ing that his health has improved con
siderably of late and that he feels con
fident of success against any man in
the prize ring.
Interest in the coming fight increases
as the date draws near. Every day
crowds of admirers of the pugilists
journey to the respective training

How the Boys of the California Heavy
Artillery Keep the Filipinos at
Bay.
Sergeant Thomas J. Fitzpatrick,
serving with Battery Ff First < 'alifor
nia Heavy Artillery, at Cavite, has
written to his father, M. I. Fitzpatrick
"f 11<Â»" Bhotwell street, giving come in
teresting- details of Hi', on the tiring
line in and about Manila.
"We are doing outpost duty at Fort
Rice, which is one of the mosi impor
tant posts on the Island of Luzon in
that it commands the only overland
road fr<mi the arsenal at Cavite to Ma
nila. Tb t -re is but one night in the
week I can undress and so to bed. The
â¢ <â  ' !' time, when not actually on
outpost duty, we must sleep in the
trenches so as to act as ;t reserve guard
in case the post is attacked.
"It is no child's play here. Yesterday
after I had posted my squad of men,
each in his own place, I thought I
would look at a copy of The Call which

him. ]{â¢â  receives them pleasantly and
gives them every opportunity to fee
how he is getting himself into shape
for the big battle.
"Fitz" has introduced many novel
and surprising, features in the prize
ring, but it remained for his coming
contest with Jeffries to give him an
opportunity to show original ideas In
the way of training. Iload work by
Btarlight and training in a tent are
novel features that will mark the re
maining preparation of the champion
for the battle on Friday m'irht. These
features "Fitz" will Introduce in his
work beginning to-morrow. Running In
the i lof the evening, "Fitz" believes
will have a more beneficial effect on
his system than in the hot sun of the
morning and afternoon. The introduc
tion of the tent idea is due to the
smallness of the barn in which he
spars. He has been unable to get th^
proper amount of foot work necessary
when training for battle, and. as he In
tends t<> devote considerable time to
that form of exercise from now on, he
decided to erect the tent.

the general feeling throughout Brittany |
is hostile to Dreyfus. However, acquittal
is certain, since there was never any case
against him save the bordereau and the
"Canaille de D " letter.
We know now that the documents are
Inapplicable to Dreyfus. What has caused
surprise is the form of the judgment. M.
Ballot de Beaupre rested the whole case
of revision on the bordereau being writ- '
ten by Esterhazy. He was of the opinion
that the court would not entertain facts
tending to annullation. inasmuch as the
Minister of Justice did not move in the
matter and that he alone could demand
proceedings for annullation. The Court of
Cassation goes on two new facts, namely
that the bordereau was by Esterhazy and
the secret communication to the court
martini of the "Canaille de D " letter.
The latter is extremely grave for Gener.il
Mercier. and, indeed, for M. Dupuy. He
was Prime Minister in 1894 and was in
formed of all that went on. It was possi
ble to regard in good faith Dreyfus a"
the author of -the bordereau. It waa
vamped up In conditions that probably
will ever be a mystery.
Esterhazy again Impudently declares
himself the author. He says that Colonel
Sandherr ordered him to write it. Gen
eral Mercier, M. Dupuy and the court
martial might have been deceived about
the authorship, but the secret communi
cation betrays the cloven foot of a devil
ish agent somewhere. This new fact is
not denied, Generals Merrier and De
Boisdeffre refused as witnesses before the
Court of Cassation to answer questions
thereupon: and their silence was inter
preted as assent, particularly as ex-Presi
lent Casimir-Perrier deposed that General
Mercier told him of the communication.
The "Canaille de D " could afford
cause for annullation; and it ought to be
brought Into the judgment and enable
Dreyfus hereafter to pursue before the
law courts both* generals and other mem
bers of the general staff. Proceedings in
criminal law can be taken and pecuniary
damages claimed.
It is a terrible outlook for the threat
ned generals, even though the Czar pro
tects De Boisdeffre.

WHEAT IN ENGLAND AND
ON THE CONTINENT
In Many Countries the Conditions?
Are Favorable for a Large
Crop.
Special Cable to The Call anil the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1599, by James Gor
don Bennett.
LONDON, June 3.â The hot summer
weather which has recently set in has
been very beneficial for wheat in Gica.l
Britain and on the Continent. R<
n ived at the close of the week from
the principal grain producing centers are
favorable for good crops. The English
market during the week was restrii ted to
the immediate demands. Foreign prim
has been (irmly held, and American
grades being scarce, a shade more money
has been asked. Australian moved slowly
at easy rates, while N\w Zealand spot
attracted no attention.
According to the Mark Lane Express '
the condition of crops In various gram j

fields. Earing will take place under nor
mal conditions in south and central de- \
partments. In the north and west the i
crop is a little backward. Germany, line J
growing weather prevailed, and crops are '
nil making satisfactory progress. Hun
gary, crops are generally good. In some
districts the growth Is almost too
luxuriant. Switzerland, cereal crops are
uniformly satisfactory. Italy, the out
look Is very encouraging. It is the same
in Holland and Belgium. Spain's crop in
the aggregate will be inferior to last
year's. Russia's winter wheat and rye
are sadly in need of rain in the south and
southwest. In Koumania the grain crop
is almost a total loss, owing to the
drought. :
STRANGE NEWSPAPER ENGLISH.
Busy Journalist Culls a Few Choice
Specimens.
The telegraph editors and ropy readers
| of newspapers run across a great many
\ remarkable statements In the copy r< -
celved from country correspondent.- and
even frum tho press associations. Trite
expressions become a habit with corre
spondents and it is one of the duties of
I the copy reader to eliminate these when
he ruiirf across them. A "desk man" on
I the Kansas <'ity Star took the trouble to
] jot down such of those as he came across
' from day to day. Some of them are actu
i ally weird, as follows:
"He was overcome by smoke in the up
pr-r story."
"The man was fatally wounded. il<>
â  may die."
"Thâ¬' supposed to be dead Jones stabbed
the alleged murderer twice, inflicting; fa
: tal wounds which be cannot survive.
".Icrrel was blown about thirty feet. He
| leaves a family."
"Smith was shot twice by the nllccred
i slayer, one ball entering the Intestines,
: the other penetrating bis right lung. The
! Coroner is Investigating. Bloodhounds.
have beeen put on the trail."
Writers often have things occur In the :
j most remarkable places. The following
instances have actually appeared in news-
I papers or have been dragged out of copy
| by editors before they gut into print:
"The man was shot twioe In the saloon."
"He fell upon his being shot."
"He was snot i n the suburbs."
"He was Injured in the fracas."
"She whipped him upon his return."
"He kissed her passionately on her re
appearance".
"He kissed her back."
"He walked in upon her invitation."
"She seated herself upon his entering."
"She fainted upon his departure."
"Ho clung to her weeping."
"They gossiped upon his downfall."
Dead persons often do stranger things
than one would suppose. Witness the
following:
"The suicide on reviving saidâ"
"Refore he died the deceased saidâ"
Triteness, however, is the besetting sin
of untrained correspondents. The ' fol
lowing are old friends and will be'recog
nized readily by newspaper readers:
"It If reported on the highest authority
by one who has the ear of the president
but whose nam<' is suppressed for obvi
ous reasons, thatâ" The Information that
usually follows a statement of that kind
is as valuable as its introduction is au
thoritative.
Th' correspondent who concludes his
story by Baying, "It is said the story can
bo supported by facts," seldom sees tho
story in print.
Seme of the most common examples of
triten< : ; s arc:
"It was a gala day, " or red letter day
as the case may ho.
"Tho police are in suspense."
"H*-. broke down and confessed."
"The distracted husband," or wife.
"A well known citizen." ' On one occa
sion the c.orrespoi%dent put it "A well
known citizen, who is also a well-to-do
farmer. "
"There is general alarm hem (iwing to
indications of a recurrence of the dis
turbances."âChicago Chronicle. "

JOCKEY SLOAN FAST
LOSING POPULARITY
Yet the American's Percentage Is Far
Ahead of That of English
Riders.
LONDON, June 3.â The fickleness of
popularity is beginning to demonstrate
itself in the case of Tod Sloan, whose re
cent failures have wrecked many of his
supporters. His big backers, like Riley
Orannan and the Dwyers, have pocketed
their losses like truo sportsmen, and have
returned to America. It is the small fry
who, while Sloan succeeded, reaped a'
harvest and arp now losing, who cannot
find words to denounce him. One of these.
on returning from Epsom last night, filled
the corridors of the Hotel Cecil with
rantinra nirainst the honesty of Sloan's]
Oaks Failure, until the hotel officials had
to remonstrate. Colonel Tom Ochiltree
declares himself a heavy loser, and says
Sloan Is a great jockey for five furlongs, '
but when every one expects him to whi j
and hacks him heavily, he is left at the
post, and that in no other way in the
world could he have lost the Oaks.
In spite of the clatter of disgruntled
losers, Sloan maintains' hope of ultimate
success this season. Of 103 mounts he baa '
won 37, while Madden heads the list of
English jockeys with 50 winnings out of
2fil mounts, and Loates has 43 wins out
ot 201 mounts. So Sloan has won 35 per i
cent of his races. ,md the best English i
jockey ha? won only 19 per cent.
INTERCOLLEGIATE GAMES.
University of Chicago Easily Gains
the Victory.
CHICAGO. June 3.â The annual field
games of the Western Intercollegiate
Association took place to-day. The
University of Chicago team won a
rather easy victory, a total of 46 points
being placed to its credit. Notre Dame
College was second with 33 points,
chiefly through the efforts of its cap
tain, J. F. Powers, and Michigan was
third with 27. The Wisconsin men failed
to live up to the expectations of their
admirers, scoring but 14 points. Other
colleges receiving credit marks were:
JOHANN STRAUSS,
WALTZ KING, DEAD
Y^ IKXNA, June 3.â Johann Strauss,
the famous composer, is dead.
Johann Strauss, the younger, the
Austrian music composer, known as the
"Waltz King," was born in Vienna,
October 85, 1825. Notwithstanding the
opposition of his father he began hts
musical studies early in life and in 1K44
made his debut as a conductor, and the
success of that occasion attended him
throughout his career. He combined
his own and his father's orchestras
after the latter's death and toured the
continent of Europe. But it is on ae
inuni uf his compositions that he was
iv_:uded us a master. He composed
his first waltz, "First Thought," when
he was but six years old. From that
time until 1870 he composed over four
hundred waltzes. At that time he re
tired from public life and devoted him
self entirely to the composition of
operettas. Of his waltzes perhaps the
most popular is the "Beautiful Blue
Danube." Of his operettas the better
known are "Indigo" (1871), "The Car
nival of Rome" (1873), "The Merry
War" and "Jabuka" (1894).
Illinois, 9: Drake University (Iowa), 5;
University of lowa, 4; Grinnell College
(Iowa), .1. and Northwestern Univer
sity, 3. The meet took place on Ravens
wood field, midway between Chicago
and Evanston.

i men engaged Indian guides and ati
i tempted the hazardous journey. While
I on the divide of Hay Mountain they
! were cought in a snowstorm and be
! came lost. Indians were sent to search
for them, but after two weeks of pain
ful toiling through snow up to their
hips they were obliged to give up and
return, which they did with difficulty.
The probability that the ten or twelve
men perished in the snow is rendered
almost a certainty.. Although the ac
cident occurred in December ther<> had
been no tidings of them up to May 15,
They wore lightly provisioned and had
no snowshoes. The names of ortly five
could be learned: "Jack" Payne, Lome
Hutton, C. Dunn, R. Taylor and
Leighton.
The Danube rassengers report the
rinding of a body in a cabin near Mud
River. From a diary found by its side
an account of the unfortunate gold
seeker"s sufferings was learned. Brielly
the story the book tells is that the un
fortunate man â MacNealey of Sault Ste.
Marie â got his feet frozen on the trail.
With his partner, Graham, he reached
the deserted hut and MacNealey could
go no further. He crawled into the
cabin and there his partner left him â
not only left him, but took all the pro
visions. The last entry is made in
January. It reads:
"Pain unbearable. Can stand it no
longer. Graham is leaving me; taking
all the grub. God help me."
The body of a German, W. Zengler,
was found in a deserted cabin. He ha.i
starved. Other miners found a skele
ton under a fir tree with a paper above
reading: "Here the trail ends."
P. Johnson, a mining engineer of
Edmonton, who spent several weeks at
McDames Creek this winter, says Val
entine Wendler of New York, a Ba
varian, and one of a party of Philadel
phians, was found dead in his cabin
twelve miles from McDames.
The body of James Mowat, a miner,
who started from Telegraph Creok for
Atlin with his Mippli^s on a handsled,
was found on the top of Egner Sum
mit, fifty miles from Telegraph, about
the end of March. He was suffering
from scurvy when he started and it is
supposed he succumbed to it. His body
was placed on a sled and brought back
to Telegraph, where there are twelve
cases of scurvy in the hospital.
Last summer, while c-rossing Toad
River on the Edmonton horse trail, one
man was drowned and.another was lost
subsequently in the Cranberry Rapids
just above Mud River. Captain Mason
is said to have been lost on Nelson
River. Charles Helmet, a Brooklyn
hotel man. has been laid up with frozen
feet at Laketon.
J. W. R. Irving tells of the capsizing
of a number of boats in Great Slave
Lake. He says about fifty men were
drowned since last summer.
Simondson, a Swede, was shot and
killed by La Chapeile, a Frenchman, at
Dease Lake.

Special Disrat.-h to Th>i Call.
[ CHICAGO, June 3.â The Times-Her
ald prints t h e following from Dean C.
Worcester, a member of the Philippine
â  Commission, under date of Manila,
June 3:
The statements made by the New
York Evening Post in an editorial pub
lished April 17, and similar statements
published in the Springfield Republi
can, are in the main grossly .-xageer
ated, and in some casH absolutely
false.
An instance of the latter kind is the
story of Anthony Miohaea, who is re
ported as saying we bombarded a
place called Malabon and then w>m In
and killed every native we met â men,
women and children.
I was personally present on the oc
casion in question. The truth of the
matter is that Malabon was never h
barded, despite the fact it was in easy
reach from the fleet and field guns.
The town had been abandoned by the
natives before our approach except for
a lot of sharpshooters, who had posi
tions in a swamp on the outskirts
j One Hotchkiss and one 3.2 inch gun
] were fired on them. Our troops first
moved to the north without entering
the town. The insurgents were driven
i out the following day while trying to
burn the place. No women or children
were killed. There were none there to
be killed.
I have personally inspected all the
[ battlefields from Caloocan to Malolos.
; Once I was on the field before the
! wounded were removed and repeatedly
! I was there before the dead were bur
j ied. I never saw a single woman or
child wounded or dead. I have found,
on the contrary, wounded rebels whose
injuries had been dresser! by the Amer
ican surgeons before the firing had
ceased, and who had also been pro
vided with food and water.
The insurgent wounded were brought
to Manila and tended In our hospitals,
OP even taken care of in private hospi
tals, the Government paying all the
expenses.
When cured the wounded can hardly
be driven away. All the prisoners are
well fed and well treated, and I may
say they are glad to have had the ex
perience, and learned to know the
Americans. Released prisoners and the
recovered wounded are our best mis
sionaries, but many of them are unwill
ing to return to their own people.
It is absolutely false that any order
was ever issued looking toward the
killing of men who might be captured.
The American soldiers have repeatedly
; taken prisoners under circumstances
affording abundant excuse for killing,
with a provocation very strong. T know
positively the city guards have been
ordered to fire on soldiers caught loot
ing if it was not practicable to make
arrests.
The natives themselves report thnt
our troops have saved property and
protected life during recent operations,
and the effect of their conduct has been
excellent. It is a great mistake to sup
pose we are fighting the Filipinos as a
whole. At least SO per cent of the pop
ulation detests war, and the only seri
ous trouble is in a few Tagallo prov
inces in Luzon.
The other provinces in this island
are now compelled by the armed force
of the insurgents to submit to the Ta
gallo rule. The people in them are
praying for the coming of the Amer
icans. The present rulers are hated on
account of their robbery and oppres
sion, and even among the Tagailos the
common people want peace.
Aguinaldo and his congress recently
appointed a commission empowered to
negotiate peace on the terms offered in
our proclamation. The military leaders
interfered, however, ami dissolved the
commission.
The war is kept up by a few leaders.
and only with the greatest difficulty.
The heads of the natives are constantly
filled with lies, and the wildest tales
are circulated by the insurgent leaders.
False and slanderous reports are man
ufactured in Hongkong and Singapore
and scattered broadcast.
Accounts of alleged atrocities printed
in the American papers are copied by
the insurgent press and cause in
calculable harm. They cost good *
American lives.
Nevertheless the situation is stead
ily improving. The war is being most
humanely conducted: the hungry are
fed; the families of the insurgent lead
ers' are granted protection in Manila,
and even allowed to enter through the
lines. About 200 persons are coming
daily into the city from the insurgent
territory, and thousands are eager to
come.
Every one here is working in the in
terest of justice, order and lasting
peace, and all are anxious for the best
good of the country and people. To
this end lawlessness must be put down
with a firm hand and armed oppression
must be made to cease.
The Juniors.
The State councilor has appointed new
deputies for the various councils of the
Junior Order of American Mechanics in
the State, and the officers chosen are very
satisfactory to the membership. With
these deputies, who are all live, energetic
men, an increase in membership and in
the number of councils during the com
ing year is looked for.
The committee on bay and river excur
sion to Stockton presented its first re
port to Abraham Lincoln Council last
Thursday. The excursion is an' assured
fact, and, realizing the pleasure and ben
efits of such a trip, the members are all
lending their assistance t" make the af
fair one worthy of the order.
â¢In view of trie fact that the California i
boys will soon return from Mar.rjn, Lin- A
coin Council appointed a committee to "^
act in the matter of taking part In the
reception of the soldiers, and the surplus
from the Washington birthday celebra
tion fund was voted to that end. The
other local councils were invited to ap
point like committees to act in conjunc
tion with Lincoln Council in this matter.FOUND NO CURE

.M.V June 3.â Nov.- that the Tu
berculosis â¢'-:â â  is over .the natural
question is, "What results has it ac
complished?" Has it come, to any prac
'i cal conclusion as to what Is best to
tie done to avoid the most stealthy,
deadly and â  : Ible of all the diseases
known to man?
It was -thought the wise heads who
assembled here during the past week
and exchanged notes upon their knowl
edge of tuberculosis wouid arrive at
some definite agreement aa 10 what
was a cure for consumption. Such,
however, has not been the case. Some
of those present we're for a i old, dry
and rareniid atmosphere, like that of
Daves in the Engadine. â¢ there were
for the balmy climate of the lilviera.
But by far t,he most, important sub
ject which came up was in â  question of
the treatment: of the great' masses of
the p.-nr, who cannot afford long jour
neys, it would appear ; ..:i t for general
treatment on a large scale, wnich â¢is
neetied by the yearly increasing num
ber of the people who suffer fiom tu
berculosis, the one plan available ts the
sanitarium. On this and other Bub
jects one of the principal United States
delegates, \\ ho I uses to allow his
name to be printed, ays:
"The Germans at present have by far
the best system of sanitariums. This
system; we all agreed, is the best with
which to meet tuberculosis. The plan
was conceived by the grandfather of
the present Emperor. All the working
men of the country were compelled to
contribute a trifle toward the building
and maintenance of tuberculosis sani
-4 taria. It will be seen from this how
much it is recognized that tuberculosis
is a national scourge. One hundred and
lifty thousand deaths in a year is the
record in Germany."
In reply to the question as to whether
the treatment of phthisical patients in
sanitaria had given favorable results
he said:
"The results generally have been fa
vorable. The prime necessities are a
dry climate, situation In the country
near a forest and southern exposure."
"What are the comparative results
Â» obtained between sanitaria winter re
sorts and the Riviera?"
"Sanitaria give the best results."
"Has the discovery of the Koch ba- :
cillus realized the hopes based upon
it?"
"Without the discover} of the tuber
culosis bacillus by Koch the results in
the treatment probably would have not
been secured."
"What role does the meat from ani- i
mals affected by tuberculosis play in
the development and propagation of
tuberculosis in man?"
"The meat from animals used for
food is nearly always cooked and plays
little or no role in the spread of tuber
culosis."
ADVEKTISEMENTS. â¢
A wreck at sea is not the only place
where a life line is of importance.
There is a life line for the sick, as well as
|->r the drowning man. It is Dr. Pierces
Golden Medical Discovery. It is not a
cure-all, but it is a scientific medicine that
goes to the fountain head of a number of
serious and fatal diseases. When a man
gets seriously sick, he can generally be
cured by the right course of treatment.
The treatment that cures many obstinate
chronic diseases consists of pure air, good
food, rational exercise, and the use of a
remedy that will: strengthen the weak
stomach, correct the impaired digestion,
invigorate the liver and promote the as-
similation of the live-giving elements of
the food. The "Golden Medical Discov-
ery" accomplishes all these things.'

I Beaie of. Marysville, Cal., ha.s just come
j out of Atlin and is on his way home.
JHe has had enough of it. Mr. Beaie
I thinks the Atlin country has- been
greatly overestimated. Whether his

â  'cold feet" is not known, but with the
latter Mr. J:<-ale admit.-; he is suffering.
iHe pays he prefers to prospect in
i Southeastern Alaska for sold quartz
i than to chase the placer phantom all

I chances for finding paying ore are
' about even with that of locating good
; gravel, to say the least, and the ex
( pf-npf- is loss by half.
Hundreds of people have left Atlin
and more are leaving daily. This is en
account of disappointment in the coun
try and prospects. Mr. Beaie says the
population of Atlin City is reduced to
about ir>o<). whereas about four weeks
ago the inhabitants of the town num
bered about 3000.
The few claims that are being worked
; are on Pine Creek. Kwi ywher.e else the
snow is too deep, being from three to
six feet deep. Three claims are being
: worked on Pine Creek close to discov
ery, but these are the only ones. Mr.
Beaie says they are paying about an
ounce a day to the man. This is a good
Btarter above bedrock.
It is exceedingly problematical that
this season will show the extent of
â  placer gold deposits in the Atlin coun
! try. The season is already a month
i late both in the Interior and on the
coast among the stamp mills. It will
be about the middle of July, unless un-
I usually warm weather sets in, before
the snow will permit work on all the
creeks that have been located, and de
velopment of the locations will also be
delayed by the complications arising
out of the passage of the anti-alien act,
the failure of locators to record in
tlmÂ«, and the neglect of young Mr,
Kant, ailing for his father, th" former
Qoid Commissioner, to make entries of
'the claims presented for record. It is
improbable that these numerous com

Surplus Product of the
June 3.â A report of
Interest to beet sugar growers has been
received by the State Department from
Consul Henry Dicdrich at Magdeburg.
It is a collection of the most Tillable
statistics -obtainable since 1877. Tt is al
most entirely composed of tables show
ing tli' development of the industry in
Germany, but of particular interest enly
to those engaged in the business. In
closing Consul Diedricn says:
â¢'The future of the German export trnde
in stiKai- has of late been engaging many
minds, and I would call special attention
to the above figures bearing on this ex
port up to the present date. These dearly
slmw that Germany must tind an outside
market lor two-thirds of fier production
and that most of this surplus for the past
live years has been sold to England and
the United States. It also will be seen
that in 1W nearly double the quantity
was rushed to our country in anticipation
of the enactment of the Dingley law, but
that the following year showed, again a
fair Average of exports. The first three
months of the present calendar year
seem to furnish no reason for complaint
to the German exporter of sugar. Krom
January 1 to March ft, 1899, the values of
sugar declared at the United States con
sulates at Magdeburg, Hamburg, Da-.ix.ig
and Stettin for export to the 1 nitea
States amounted to $:'.,7:59,934. an Increase
of $3,455,695 over those reported during ihe

to a letter from a Washington volunteer

MRS. MAYBRICK
MAY BE FREED
Likely to Be Released at
Any Moment.
Copyrighted, 1899, by the Associated Press.
LONDON, June 3.â A representative
of the Associated Press has made In
quiries with the result that he is able
to confirm the report that those who
have been working in favor of Mrs.
Florence Maybrick will not be sur
prised at her release at any moment,
now that the United States Embassa
dor, Joseph H. Choate, has had two in
terviews on the subject with the Mar
quis of Salisbury, at which his strong
representations of the American view
of the matter met with a most prom
ising reception.
Mr. Choate, since his arrival in Ena
land, has taken the liveliest interest in
the case. He has received every shred
Of information in the matter, has asked
for higher judicial opinions, and bis
own legal knowledge has given him
exceptional facilities in dealing with
the intricacies of the case. One of Mrs.
Maybrick's advocates, a well-known
worker of the Liberal party. J. H. Levy,
provided Mr. Choate with a specially
compiled dossier of the whole case, in
the collation of which he received the
advice of the highest legal authorities
in the kingdom, including the Lord
Chief Justice, Baron Russell of Kil
lowen, and Lord James of Hereford,
Attorney General to the Prince of
Wales, one of the calmest judicial
minds, who definitely states that the
position as left by Henry Matthews
(the former Home Secretary, now Vis
count Landaff) is absurd and shows in
the strongest light the present con
fused state of the English criminal law.
Mr. Choate received the most definite
instructions from Washington, the gist
being that he was to press for an im
mediate revision of the case, as the
United States Government considered
the time had arrived for an immediate
consideration of it. To these instruc
tions and the spirit in which they are
being carried out by Mr. Choate. who
said "I will see this thing through."
Mrs. Maybrick's pending freedom will
be largely due.

SANTA BARBARA. June 3.â This was

libel trial. The proprietors of the local
papers wore on the stand to prove the
authorship of letters supposed to have
heen written by the defendant. Mrs.
Storko worked on the papers. The pro
prietors gave testimony regarding her
handwriting. Postmaster Maulsby was
on the witness stand. - Through him the
anonymous libelous letters were called to
the attention of the Postofflce Depart
ment. The trial will probably last all of

CHICAGO, June 3.â John P. Altgeld not
only confirms the report that he Intends to

mittee of the Democratic National Com
mittee, but made the announcement that
Senator James K. Jones is also thinking
of severing his connection with the com
mmee. He said to-night: "The only rea
son why I wish to be relieved of the duties
pertaining to that committee is that I
have enough other work to do."

PRIVILEGES FOR
CABLE STATIONS
Can Be Secured From
Germany.
INFORMAL UNDERSTANDING
- â¦
SO UNCLE SAM IS NOT WORRIED
AS TO CAROLINES.
Naval Officers Think, However, That
America Should Have Trik^n All
of Spain's Isj rinds in the
Pnciflc.
Special nispatch to Th<> Cjall.
NEW YORK, June 3.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the, Herald tele
graphs: By Germany's acquisition of
the Caroline Islands the United States
can get without cost the cable station
privileges for which Spain demanded a
big price when the matter was under
consideration by the Peace Commission
in Paris. There is good reason for be
lieving that there is already an infor
mal understanding between the two
countries whereby Germany stands
read; to grant tht- United States privi
leges regarding the landing of an
American cable at some desirable point
in tha Caroi-r.es similar to those we re
cently granted for the German cable
in the United Suites. It cannot of
j coin so be officially -stated that Germany
formally altered ;u the time she asked
to be allowed to land the German cable
I in the vicinity of New York to return
the con phnieni by giving us a cable in
the Caiolines when she got them. I
have reliable Information ihat the ad
ministration authorities have not only
know.. Lor a long time in it Germany
w:is going to purchase Spain's remain
ing Pacific Islands, bu: that the United
States couid hnvo cable privileges in the
Islands under the wev; sovereignty if
this country desired them.
It h;;s not yet 'developed that the
United States will avail itself of a ca
ble concession. In the surveys of a di
rect cable mute to Manila thus far
I made the Carolines have not been in
cluded, ths policy being to avoid if pos
sibl â¢ making landings in any foreign
territory.
I talked to-day with a high official
of the administration, who said: "No
concern Is felt by tins Government at
the acquisition by Germany "i" the re
mainder <-f Spain's island possessions in
the Pacific. Although the monetary
consideration is not lar,Te, other conces
sions are given, and that under which
Germany" guarantees to protect Spain's
coaling station in the islands in the
event of war might be construed in the
nature of an alliance with the Madrid
| Government. ( Â»f course a nation at war
with Spain would at once endeavor to
obtain her outlying possessions, and
<;>-!inany's objection in the case of Pa
; cific stations would probably embroil
the Berlin Government."
Tn naval circles considerable disap
pointment has been expressed at the
failure of the United Sta.tes to demand
all of Spain's islands in the PacifleftUld
it is recognized that their purchase has
given a formidable power a splendid
naval base from which to operate in
case of war with this country. They
point out that all of those islands are
in proximity to the Philippines.
Rear Admiral Bradford, chief of the
Bureau of Equipment, who was the
naval attache to the Peace Commission,
strongly urged upon that body that all
of the Spanish islands be taken. He
gave it as his opinion that if the United
States did not take possession of the
Carolines Spain would sell them to Ger
many, and the latter, he declared, was
the most troublesome neighbor we
could have.
TEN MILLION PESETAS
FOR THE CAROLINES
BERLIN, June 3.â A high official tells
the correspondent here of the Associated
Press that the acquisition of the Carolines
is a valuable rounding' of the German pos
sessions, at the same time injuring- no
other power, but rather the contrary. He
added: "The negotiations began as soon
as. it became known that the United
States would obtain the Philippines. The
United States and Great Britain did not
raise any objections."
Officials of the United States embassy
state that the United States Government
has been kept informed of every step
taken by Germany since the autumn and
that German ownership of the islands in
no way interferes with American plans
and policy in that quarter.
It is reported in diplomatic circles that
Germany pays ten million pesetas for the
islands. â  . *â  '
Responding to the statement of the Lon- |
don Standard that the cession' of the Caro- j
lines Is Germany's reward for diplomatic
service rendered by her to Spain, the Ber
liner Neueste Nachrlchten says the . insin- j
uation is more than counterbalanced by |
the much more reasonable utterances of
the Times and ,' Morning Post ; regarding
the cession. : . ' â  -
It adds that the assertion that Germany
did not show equal honest neutrality to
either side during the Spanish-American
war, as well as the "untrue supposition
that Germany had intended to acquire
possession of the Philippines or part
thereof, have been refuted by . the Minis
ter of Foreign Affairs. Baron yon Bulow,
in his speech in the Reichstag -when he
was applauded by all parties."
The same old Bismarck organ, being
also the. organ of the German Colonial
party looks upon the cession of the isl
ands* as a symptom ; of the existence of
very friendly relations between the United
States and Germany.
The Post of this city,. a strong govern
mental paper, writing in a similar strain,
thinks the cession is "an indirect proof of
the restoration of. the most cordial terms
between the . two countries," > pointing out
that a treaty by- which Germany becomes
a neighbor to the United States in the Pa
cific Ocean "would hardly have been con
cluded if Germany had not been perfectly
assured that the appearance of her Hag
in 'the Caroline archipelago would not
create any kind of bad feeling in "Wash-
The extenslon of German sovereignty in
The extension of German sovereignty in
the neighborhood of the Philippines, the
Post also says, is the "best refutation of
the alienations which have been made,
as pertinaciously, and- unsucessfully, as
to the disturbance of the good relations
between the United States and Ger
many." â¢' . â  : , ' .

An Insane Domestic Attempts to
Atone for an Imaginary Sin,
but Her Life Is

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. June 3.â A Burlington,
Vt.. special to the Herald says: _ Pos
sessed with the idea that she 'must
i ruclfy herself, after the manner of
Christ's crucifixion, Delia Dutelly, 42
I years old, a domestic in the family of
C. A. Barber, drove, in succession, a
s]>ikc ihrnugh both hands and both feet
j yesterday and lay down to die. She
! was taki-n to a hospital and will prob
: ably recover.
The woman has not been herself for
\ several days. She went to her room
i about 10 o'clock Thursday morning.
; Sc-on afterward Mrs. Barber heard
| pounding, but thought nothing of it.
Luter she heard a call from the woman,
; and, gmng to hvr room, found her lying
on the floor. In each hand and foot was
1 a wour.d made by a spike and blood was
flowing from small wi.-unds in her fore
head. Deliy calmly announced to her
mistress that she had crucified herself
and was going to die.
:*l is. Barber hurried her into bed and
later had her taken to the hospital. She
refused to have a physician, and said
â  !:â â  only wanted to see Father Barrett.
She said she had known for several
days she must do this thing. It was her
atonement for sin.
The deed was planned with great care
and executed- with entire disregard of
pain. But one nail was used and it was
therefore necessary to pull it from the
flesh for each new driving. The woman
had taken a bath and nut on clean
Hothing before she began her crucifix
ion.

BATTLE FOR LIFE
WITH TWO WOLVES
Kansas Man Barely Escapes Being

Beasts.
BURLINGTON. Kan*.. Juno 3.â A battle for life with wolves in Kansas in
is an occurrence so remarkable as to be almost beyond belief; but,
ng i' the story of several reputable citizens, that is what befell a man
from Guthrie, Oklahoma, one of the last days of May.
Wo was traveling overland in a covi red wagon, and the adventure occurred
between the towns of Burlington and GrMley, In the eastern portion of the State.
In approaching a ravine spanned by a culvert he was startled to see two large
gray wolvef es almost extinct in the settled prairie country coming
toward him at a run. They plunged under the culvert and the man drove across,
and went back to Investigate their strange conduct.
He had pcarc< ly ,â  .1 the m.nith of the culvert when both wolves sprang

the attack, he defended himself with his hands as well as possible while retreat-

The recent neglect <>f the Bank of
England to protect its gold reserve has
leep and unfavorable impres

are said to be greatly dissatisfied with
th'- recent management, during which
th" bank concentrated its; whole atten

ness, neglecting its duties as the
holder of the country's ultimate bank

The Statist in a strong article on the
subject this week says: "England is
absolutely depend* ni on the amount of
gold held by the bank, which is over
D millions less than the amount
held by ih>- associated banks of New

danger and humiliation it had to face

giving in detail the proceedings of thai
Joint High Commission In Washington on j
February 18 relating to the British pro
posals for arbitration on the Alaskan |
boundary. It says the British Commls- j
sioners proposed the Immediate appoint
ment of a tribunal of arbitration to de
termine the boundary between Alaska'
i and ' lanada from the southernmost point
at Prince of Wales Island to Mount St. .
Elias, in accordance with the Anglo- |
Russian treaty of February 28, 1825, cha â¢
I tribunal to ctmsist of three jurists, one >
j nominated by the Privy Council, one by |
President McKlnley and the third to be |
selected by the two nominees.
The ruhs governing the arbitrators
were as follows:
A. Adverse holding of prescription dur- j
ing a period of fifty years shall make good
the title. The arbitrators may deem ex
clusive political control of the district, as
well as settlement 'hereof, sufficient to
constitute adverse holding or make pre
scriptive title.
B. The arbitrators may recognize and
Heel to rights of claims resting on |
any other ground valid according to in
ternational law or principles of Interna
tional law that the arbitrators may deem
1 applicable to the case which arc not in
; contravention of rule A.
C. in determining; ihe boundary, If the
territory of any one party shall be found i
: bi th.> tribunal to have been at the date ,
of this treat;/ in occupation "t' the sub- '
jects or citizens of the other party, such
effei ts shall he given to such occupation
: as reason, justice, the principles of inter
national law and the equity of the case
| require.
The other articles provide for a meet-
Ing sixty days after the printed articles ;
are submitted; that all questions, In
cluding the final Judgment, shall be de- j
termined by a majority of all the arbitra
tors, the decision, If possible, to be ren
dered within three months of the clos<
of arguments; and the employment of j
necessary assistance of scientific experts, :
each Government to pay Its own expenses j
and the other expenses to be equally di- '
Vided.
The concluding article provides that the
high contracting parties shall engage to
consider th<- result of the proceedings as
a full, perfect and final settlement of all
questions referred to the arbitrators.
The Americans accepted the proposals
as the basis of adjustment, hut they pro
posed in addition to the Anglo-Russian
treaty that the boundary should be :Ic
fined in accordance with the Russian-
American treaty of cession or as tne
same shall be established by -the tribunal.
under rules hereinafter provided, ttte
tribunal to consist of six impartial jurist.-^
of repute, three to be nominated by the
Privy Council ajjd> three by. the President
of the l nited, States. The America^
;ils'i proposed ah amendment to rule A,
as follows:
"In considering the 'roast'- referred to in
said treaties, it is understood that the
â¢ continent is intended and that all
towns and settlements on tidewater set
tled under authority of the United States
and under jurisdiction of the United
States at the date of the treaty shall
remain within the territory and juris
diction of the United States."
The Uritish Commissioners regretted
that they were absolutely unable to ac
â¢!:â¢ suggested modification to their
proposition, because the suggested Ameri
can tribunal did not provide a tribunal
which would necessarily and in the pos
silile event of dlff< r< nc< I of opinion finally
dispose of the Question, and because the
amendment to rule C marked an import
ant departure from the rules of tho \ ene
zuelan boundarj :â¢ ference, which left all
BUCfa questions to be determined by the
tribunal, and because the words added by
tin (Jnited States claim that an effect
Bhould be given to their occupation of
land In Jlriiish territory, which justice,
reason and the equities of the case re
quire.
The British Commissioners also ob
i that the language used with refer
ence to the coast was open to miscon
struction, and they were of the opinion
that it was useless to further press the
negotiations at present and that they
must refer the matter to their Govern
ment for an exchange of views in re
spect to the constitution of thij tribunal.
The Americans inquired whether the
British Commissioners had considered
the question of selecting an umpire from
the American continent. The British
members replied in the affirmative, add
ing that they thought it most objection
able, in view of the policy long main
tained and recently asserted by the Gov
ernment of the United States toward
other nations on the said continent. The
ion of an umpire by any such na
tion would not oiler a guarantee Of im
partiality, which waa the first qualifica
tion requisite.
The Americans then proposed to proceed
to settle the remaining subjects, as they
thought it would be unwise to defer ad
justments so nearly concluded. Several
subjects were so far advanced as to as
sure the probability of a settlement. If.
then, all the differences except one could
now be adjusted would it not be most
commendable to advance neighborly
friendship and could not the respective
Governments be trusted to settle the
principal remaining difference by direct
negotiations? The British Commissslon
ers replied that all questions should be
deferred until the boundary was disposed
of either by agreement or by reference to
arbitration, because the manner In which
they were prepared to adjust some oth->r
important matters must depend upon
whether It would be possible to arrive at
a settlement of all questions which might
at any time occasion acute controversy
and even conflict.
VETERAN FIREMAN RETIRES.
Served on the San Francisco Depart
ment in the Sixties.
STOCKTON, Juno 3.â Charles McGhan,
' for seventeen years a member of the
Stockton Fire Department, has resigned
|on account of advancing: age. Previous
to his connection with the Stockton de
partment McGhan was a member of the
I San Francisco department, having seen
1 service there &a early as 1869. He was an
! active participant in the trouble between
; the rival chiefs. Scannell and Whitney
l lr- was much attached to the cause of
the former, and when the Whitney r'om
-1 mission came in he and several others
were thrown out. They subscribed to a
I fund and helped Scunnell make his fight.
i In a few weeks things came their way
and they had the satisfaction of seeing
the other fellows take a walk and were
reinstated at their old posts.
In San Francisco McGhan waa discip
i lined but twice. Once was for taking a
run over to Oakland for the purpose of
attending B picnic, in which lark he was
accompanied by two other members of
the department. On the boat over he saw
, smoke toward the Mission and, believing
tt waa a fire, he returned on the next
boat and was able to nut in two hours'
' work. He was laid off for fifteen days,
while the firemen who went on to the
picnic escaped with thirty days' suspen
sion.

THEORIES AS TO
CAUSE OF WRECKS
Disasters on the Manacles May
Have Beer) Caused by Chaog
iog Lizard Lights.
LONDON, June 3.â The wreck of the Mohegan and the grounding of
the Paris on almost the same spot of the dreaded Manacles have caused
much discussion in the London papers. The Phoenix, a weekly review,
published a sensational story to the effect that while both disasters ap
parently cannot be explained, a possible solution could be found in the
theory that the Lizard lights were inaccurate. It points out that
these lights are so screened that only portions of them are visible, and
that Admiralty directions state that when steamers coming down the
channel get these two lights in line,' then the course would clear the
Manacles. But the Phoenix points out that should one of these lights
be tampered with and the screen be shifted so that the light would be
expospd more than usual, a vessel steering for these lights would be
brought upon the Manacles. Of course this is merely a supposition, but
as there appears to be no satisfactory explanation for these (wo disas
ters this hypothesis attracts much attention.

LONDON, June 3.â For some time there

the rumors that they Beemed doubtful. A

that a great cause celebre was likely to

ARTICLES ON
ARBITRATION
Several Agreed to With
out Modification.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
THE HAGUE, June 3.â The drafting
committee of the Peace Conference
to-day held an important meeting, at
which M. de Staal. head of the Russian
delegation; Sir Julian Pauncefote, chief
of the British delegation, and Count
Nlgra, chief of the Italian delegation,
were present.
Articles 7 to -12 of the Russian pro
posal bearing on arbitration were
agreed to almost without modification,
though the American delegates declared
that they could not admit the provis
ions of article 10 that monetary ques
tions and questions concerning inter
oceanic canals should be compulsorily
submitted to an arbitration tribunal.
The entire commiitee on mediation
i and arbitration will meet Monday to
i review the work accomplished by the
' drafting committee. The latter will
; take up on Wednesday the most impor
tant question of article 13, which deals
with the establishment of an arbitra
tion court.
It is expected that the American,
British and Russian proposals will be
welded into one. and there is every in
dication of a universal desire to reach
the establishment of a system of per
manent arbitration, the German dele
gates, whose opposition was formerly
feared, declaring themselves as desir
ous as the other members of the ('in
ference to arrive at such a conclusion.

Mare Island.
U Dispatch to The Call.
YALLKJo, Juno ;?.â John M. Gregory
Jr.. eldest son of Judge Gregory of
Bulsun and a Stanford graduate, was
drowned this afternoon off Mare
Island. Hf was one of a party of seven
on a cruise in the yacht Nellie, a large
Bloop belonging to the Corinthian, club.

- ripps, sons of K. \V. Scripps
<â  Mlramar, San Diego County, Mil-
Roberta, a Stanford student, and
Torn Gregory, also a Stanford man
ami a brother of John.
All the party, except Mr. Gregory
and the Chinese cook, hat] gone ashore
t Bee the wonders of the navy yard.
At about 1 o'clock men working on the
McCullofch saw Gregory, clad in a light
Ing suit, dive from the bow of the
yacht. He had suspended a rope from
the stern, and it was his intention to
â â¢ this as the tide swept him down
and pull himself aboard. He missed the
rope. The current swept him down
ird the Speedwell, another yacht
ired seventy-five yards astern of
Nellie. He tried to catch the an
chor rope of this but failed. He then
: sperately for Mare Island,
calling for help.
A boat was lowered from the Mc-
Culloch, but before it could touch the
v sank from sight and
: no more. He drowned In sight
â  : ixty persons. The body
iol yet been recovered.
â¢i - yacht will be sailed home to
Tiburon to-day and th" cruise gives
up. At the time of the accident prep
iirati tade to take out a party
of Vallejo 'lies for a sail.

llejo, Bcnicia and Suisun. He had
established in law with his father
In Fairfleld ever Bince his graduation
from Stanford i:; '06. His parents and

He was an cxperi yachtsman and a!
irery caution:.

POWDER USED TO

Business Portion of Re
public Burned.
il Dispatch to Tho rail.
REPUBLIC. Wash., June 3.â Fire
broke out here at 6 o'clock this morn
ing and before the flames were brought
under subjection the damage amounted
to a quarter of a million dollars. At
noon the business portion of the town
was a mass of smouldering ruins, while
on three sides were rows of scorched
buildings marking the path of the
flames. Tho fire fighting apparatus
could not check the blaze, and it was
used only to save some of the build
ings outside tho fire zone that were
smoking and breaking into flames at
times.
The fire was started by the explosion
of a gasdine stove in the Seigel build-
Ing on Clark avenue, where some men
were cooking breakfast. It spread on
the west side of the street to Brown's
restaurant and south to tho Republic
Trading Company's store. On tho \vst
side two.entire blocks were destroyed.
Powder was used to blow up the
building occupied by Alexander's law
office. Then tlv- Perry building was sent
skyward and the fiying brands scatter
ed the fire to the buildings on the east
side of ('lark avenue.
It is rumored that two opium "fiends"
were burned in one of the buildings.
It is impossible, however, to learn
where the supposed victims were lo
cate.l.
Twenty-eight buildings are ruined.
Tiny were occupied by these firms:
Republic Trading Company, Coeur
d'Alene saloon, Manila saloon, Spokane
Candy Company, Spokane cigar store,

FOUNTAIN FEARED
ASSASSINATION
Suspected Men Who Are
Now on Trial.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ° Call.
HILLSBORO, N. M.. June 3.â The State
in the Fountain murder trial this morning
bolstered up the corpus delicti, which was
somewbai crippled i>y the failure to es
tablish the fact that it was human blood
found near Colonel Fountain's buckboard
through Professor Crosson yesterday, by
tho evidence of Captain Thomas Branni
gan, an old BCOUt. He first, told that there
w( re evidence a of the party having carried
a heavy object <>ii .1 horse and deposited
it on a blanket at night. This was givi n
foundation yesteday by evidence of the
trail of a bloody lilinket. Tracks of a
child's shoe were light, only of one foot.
and two to four fe-.-t apart, as if it had
been made with the shoe on a hand.
â 'I measured the tracks of three men
about the bloody camp and at the other
camps, along the traii of Beven horses
from this point," said the witness, "and
the next day found tracks on Lee's dirt
roof exactly like one, having the heel run
over, I had found in the camps. I pre
served the measurements. Whin MeNew,
was originajly charged with complicity,
ciime to Las Cruces a short time later,*!
waited for a chance and measured his
tracks. These gave . the same measure
ments as one of those about the camps.
The tracks of Lee*s horses also cor
itsponded with thor-e of the largest horse
on the trail from the bloody camp."
On the cross-examination of Captain
Brannigan a fruitless attempt was made
to show that Major Llewellyn and others
v.i re persecuting Lee and Gilliland. The
witness could not he shaken, and after a
two-hours' tire of questions, was released.
Hrannigan, while on the stand, said he
would tell something that would make.
Attorney Fall sick. Fall has for years
been a bitter political enemy of Major
L.ewellyn of the Rough Riders, who is
the most important witness for the State
yet to come, he having led the searching
party and directed the investigation of
the murder of Colonel Fountain and son.
Major Llewellyn was called this after
noon, but counsel decided they could not
finish with him and he will go on Mon
day.
Others were called to testify a~s to the
suspicious actions of I>ee and Gilliland,
and the attorneys got into a warm dis
cussion as to the competency of the evi
dence of a conversation between MeNew
and Charles Lusk. The latter 1 .-; testi
mony was to the effect that McXew de
clared enmity for Colonel Fountain near
the place where the trailing party were
baffled by a herd of Lees cattle being
driven over the trail of the party going
from Fountain's last camp. MeNew was
implicated in the murder, but was dis
charged before Lee and Gilliland were
apprehended. Colonel Fountain disap
peared while returning from their prose
cution for stealing cattle.
The evidence was finally admitted.
Humphrey Hill testified that Colour!
Fountain feared assassination on ac
count of the enmity of parties indicted for
cattle stealing. The court ordered testi
mony as to the cause of this fear stricken
out.
Lusk, who is a Deputy Sheriff, then told
of a conversation with MeNew, quoting
him as follows: "Fountain had told some
parties he had no hope of convicting us,
but he was going to break us up. It looks
bad to be chased around that way when
he has no hope of convicting us."
Witnesses for the defense are arriving
on every stage. I.ie town Is crowded to
night and there are varied prognostica
tions as to the result of Major Llewellyn's
cross-examination by his political enemy.
Attorney Fall; also as to the probable
outcome if the factions come together
after the close of the trial. So far they
have been kept well apart. Lee. who is
known as a cattle king, and Is very
wealthy, is sparing no expense to secure
the. acquittal of himself and his friend.
THE EMPORIUM.
POWER BROUGHT
FROM THE SIERRA
The Blue Lakes Plant
Successful.
Bjifcial Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON, June 3.â The powerful
voltage of electric power generated by
tli' Rlue Lakes /plant in the Sierras,
forty-five miles away, was sent over
wires to-day and the ponderous ma
chinery at the local powor-house sprang
into life. The trial of the line was in
the eyes of the experts entirely suc
cessful, but because everything did nut
move as smoothly as on an old line
others were inclined to be dubious of
the success of the venture. C. P. Gil
bert, general manager of the Standard
Electric, said this evening the tests de
veloped all that could be expected and
the frequent shutdowns were not un
usual, as there were many things that
could be adjusted only after an actual
trial showed where and what was lack
ing. He predicted everything would be
humming within a short time.
It is forty-live miles from the local
power-house to the main plant in the
mountains of Amador County. A feat
ure of the line which makes it unlike
any other in the United States is that
the wires are aluminum. Copper wire
is just as good, but aluminum costs but
half as much. The success of the \in>
probably will revolutionize many old
time ideas concerning the supposed in
dispensable requirement of copper
composition in all wires for heavy
voltage.
As soon as the local- lines are in
working order power will be delivered
to the Sperry Mills and other big fac
tories, contracts having been obtained
months ago. The Stockton Gas and
Electric Company takes a large amount
of power.
Mr. Gilbert says the division to
Stockton would never have been con
structed if that was all the company
had in view.
"ThÂ£ line to Stockton is only a step
to the bay cities," he said. "We have
entered Into an agreement with the
Oakland Gas and Electric Company to
supply it with power for illuminating
purposes and are now engaged in ne
gotiating with the railroad companies
of that city to furnish power for ope
rating the car systems. In San Jose
we are negotiating with the Electric
Improvement Company and the rail
roads. Incidentally along the line to
the bay towns we will light Livermore,
Pleasanton. San Mateo and the string
of settlements in that vicinity, drop
ping illuminating power as we go
along."
Mr. Gilbert was not definite as to
when San Francisco would be reached,
but he thought it would be by next
June at the latest. The preliminary
surveys for the line to the bay are al
ready beinfr made. As the plans of
the company have been materially en
larged since contracts were let for this
division, additional wires must be
strung on the poles and other additions
made to insure the prompt delivery of
15,000 and more horsepower the com
pany expects to contract to deliver.

NINE STUDENTS
RECEIVE AWARDS
Graduate From San Ra-
fael High School.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, June 3.â Nine happy
graduates of the San Rafael High
School sat on the platform at Gordon's
Opera-house last evening, and with the
cheers of a large audience ringing in
their ears received from President
Wlckman of the City Board or Educa
tion the diplomas they had earned by
faithful attention to their books. The
large hall was transformed for the oc
casion into a lioral bower, and the pa
triotic sentiment of students and fac
ulty was shown by a liberal decoration
of American Hags, the largest of which
was draped across the back of the
stage. The distribution of diplomas
was the sign that started a caravan of
boys laden with huge bouquets toward
the stage, and in a short time the grad
uates were almost hidden beneath their
fragrant burdens.
On the platform with the graduates
were seated the members of the City
Hoard of Education and the High
School faculty. County Superintendent
of Schools Robert Furlong presided,
and after Introductory remarks in
which a welcome was extended to the
parents of the graduates and the visit
ing public, he introduced Miss P. Clif
ford, who rendered a selection on the
piano.
Little Kathleen Parlow, the well
known musical prodigy, followed with a
violin solo, after which the address of
the evening was delivered by Professor
R. C. Bentley. the principal of the
school. '
For his theme Professor Bentley
chose "The Place of the High School
in the Community." His speech dealt
first with the science of municipal gov
ernment, during which he advocated
centralization of power as a remedy for
the numerous evils now existing. In
his opinion the high school was not
meant to fit pupils for a business life,
but to prepare them for the university.
He did not believe education to be a
preparation for any life at all. but tfÂ»
be life itself, the power to grasp and
comprehend intellectually being repre*
sen.ted as the keenest enjoyment known
to mankind.
A vocal solo by Miss Rose Caesar
was followed by the valedictory ora
tion, delivered by Reginald G. Clifford.
Dr. Wick man then awarded diplomas
to Anita J. Bain, Reginald G. Clifford,
Henry M. Hansen, Mary J. King, Elsa
A. Lichenberg, Marguerite M. Nagle,
Ersilia M. Sartori. Martha M. Smith
and Agnes M. Watson.
The exercises concluded with a violin
solo by Kathleen Parlow.
Trustee Sylva Apologizes.
SAN RAFAEL, June 3.â Contrary to ex
pectation, no blood was shod when Dis
trict Attorney Mclsaac ami Trustee Bylva
of Sausalito met to-day in Justice Rod
den's court when the case of Joseph Har
\i y, charged with having employed a
gambling device in his poolrooms was
heard on demurrer. Sylva came to this
city yesterday and publicly apologized to
Mclsaae for the foul language used on a
former occasion, excusing himself on the
ground that he was drunk when the of
fense was committed. The demurrer was
overruled and the case set for trial on
Monday, June 12. Knight & Heggerty
appeared for the defense: Mclsaae and
Daniel A. Ryan for the prosecution.

Emperor William Shows
Great Activity.

BERLIN. June 3.â Throughout the week
the Emperor has shown extraordinary ac
tivity. On Sunday he received the Ger
man and foreign delegates to the tub.-r
--culosis congress and conversed with them
several hours, showing an intimate
knowledge of the proceedings and demon
strating that he has an accurate idea of
the whole subject. To a German dele
gate he said tersely: "More soap, and
still more Boap; that is what is needed to
check the advance of infectious diseases."

The two groat spring parades. Tuesday
on the Templehof and Wednesday at

owing to the presence of many distin
guished guests, including Archduke Fran

throne, Duke Nicholas of Wurtemnerg,
Prince John George Of Saxony and a score
of others. There were more Americans
present than on any former occasion. Be
sides the personnel of the I'nited States

Sherman and his niece. Mrs. Wyberg: Dr.

â  Willard Merrill of Milwaukee; George

i Behler were among the guests at the "pa
rade dinner" in the evening at the royal
castle. Lieutenant Commander Behler
was also present at the launching of the
warship Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse at
i Kiel on Thursday. On both occasions the
Emperor went out of his way to show
him attention.
A guest at the Kiel festivals tells the
correspondent of the Associated Press
that one of the incidents was the visit of
the Emperor to the new gunboat Jaguar,
which is leaving to-morrow for the pur
pose of joining the German fleet in Chi
nese waters. Assembling the crew, his
Majesty addressed them, saying he hoped
they would try to rival the glorious crew
of the lltize in fidelity to country and
Emperor, adding: "And don't let the
Chinese out there spit in your faces."
The crew responded with tremendous
cheering.

knowledged that Sir Julian Paunc'efote

such a sweeping nature as Great Britain
proposed was untenable and out of tho

<imil>ts the correctness of the version

going too far beyond the Czar's instruc

Irish questions, and expresses the belief
that neither power is willing to accept
in principle such courts as Sir Julian

This article has attracted much atten
tion, as it is believed it reflects the opin
ions of the Government.
The correspondent learns from an ex
celent source that the interview between
Dr. J. W. Leyds, the Minister of the
Transvaal here, and Baron yon Buelow.
the Minister of Foreign Affairs, was not
of a very cordial nature. The Foreign
Minister emphatically told the Transvaal
representative that the wisest and best
course for the Boer Government was to
make peace with Great Britain, and.
above all. to speedily grant reforms. This
did not leave a doubt in Dr. Levels' mind
that Germany also wishes to see the re
forms introduced.
IMPRESSIVE SERVICES
IN THE GREEK CHURCH
NEW YORK, June 3.â Beautiful and
impressive in color, strange Oriental
chanting and incense burning, was the
service celebrated yesterday in the Syrian
Arabian church by the Russian Bishop
of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands,
whose seat is at San Francisco.
Bishop Tikhon is visiting New York for
a few days on business connected with
the orthodox Greek parishes in this city
and vicinity, which belong to his vast
diocese. During his stay he will cele
brate three pontifical services, to which
such of the public as are interested in
the ceremonies of the Greek church are
invited.
The first service was that of to-day. It
was a celebration of the pontifical lit
urgy, and was most beautiful and pictur
esque in its solemnity. . the magnificence
of the Bishop and priests forming a strik
ing contrast to the crowd of poorly
dressed, dark-faced Syrian men and
women in the room, for the church is in
one of the poorest districts in the city.
The priests and choir-boys wore gorgeous
robes, and yet more beautiful was the sil
ver colored robe which was placed on the
shoulders of the Bishop by the attendant
priests, a gift of the Czar.

THE NEXT SPEAKER.
THE choice of a Speaker to succeed Mr. Reed is
of very great importance to the country, and is
to he influential in determining the future of
the Republican party.
The candidates are Sherman and Payne of New
York. Bingham and perhaps Dalzell of Pennsylvania,
Hopkins of Illinois, and Henderson of lowa.
The Republican strength in the House consists of
fifteen votes from the South, sixty-six votes from the
East, and one hundred and four from the West;
necessary to a choice in the caucus, ninety-three.
The East enters four candidates, the West two, the
South none.
Since the adoption of the constitution thirty-seven
ficn have held the office of Speaker of the House.
It was originally estimated the third place in the Gov
ernment. By development, use and prescription it
has in some important respects become, the first
place. It has been occupied by Pennsylyanians four
times. Connecticut once, New Jersey twice, Massa
chusetts four times, North Carolina once, Kentucky
six times. New York twice, Virginia four times, Ten
nessee twice, Indiana three times, Ohio once. Georgia
twice. South Carolina once, Maine twice. The office
has been held, therefore, fifteen times by the East,
seventeen times by the South and five times by the

Now. as the center of population and of party
has shifted to the West, it is natural that that
section should look to possession of the Speakership.
As the West has only two candidates, it is natural
that one of them should succeed. The two Western
candidates are men of note. Mr. Henderson has been
nine times to the House from the Dubuque
District. He is yet a young man. born in IR4O. Ho

private iri the Union army, was advanced to a second

THE RAILROAD AND THE SANDLOT.
THE Evening Railroad Placard is at it again.
On Friday last it had much to say about mob
law and personalities. In neither article, one
of them a quotation, is there anything to provoke
discussion, but in both there are some passages that
l invite reminiscence.
The Sandlot is a favorite allusion of this turgid
resentative of the railroad monopoly, when it re
to the resistance of the decent press to railroad
corruption and to railroad exactions. Evidently it
possesses a poor memory or its sources of informa
tion are defective. The sandlot is vividly recollected
San Francisco. Its. temporary' home was part of
â¢tin natural frontage of the new City Hall facing on
Market street, that was stupidly sold and must speed
i ily be repurchased. Its chief production was fleas.
It was long occupied by a turbulent crowd, many of
them honestly misled, but also embracing the most
vicious and "the laziest elements of our population.
These agitators called themselves workingmen. but
â¢ only industrial distinction was the eriormou
â¢y and toughness of their lungs. Their manage
j ment was trinitarian and embraced a tallow-faced
English chartist, a Missourian who Had ungracefully
j retired from his native State, and last, but not least, a
! hard-faced demagogue from the western coast of one
oi the finest islands in the sea, whose mob government
ceased about the time that John Hayes pushed him
from the stage of Platt's Hall into the orchestra
space beneath. The occasion was a forcible attempt
to take possession of a public meeting, and when, to
borrow an apt simile of the day, the ungrammatical
leader of the proletarians landed "like a bullfrog in
a Spring Valley reservoir," the collapse of the sand
lot was assured.
But while it lasted it was mischievous. It produced
much noise, many parades and considerable violence.
It reveled in coarseness, in profanity, and in denun
ciation of law and order. It greatly reduced the value
I of property, because for a while reputable citizens felt
â¢ i hey were in danger of homicide and arson. Its
I favorite designation of a taxpayer was that he was a
It caused destructive fires in various parts of
the municipality. It ceaselessly threatened extensive
conflagrations. It abused merchants and capitalists
by name. It advocated lynch law as the birthright of
non-producers. At one period it compelled the or
ization of the "Pick Handle Brigade"' at Horticul
-1 tural Hall as an aid to the authorities in extinguish
ing torches and suppressing the fury of assassins..
The sandlot enforced the adage that "extremes
meet" Its raids upon property were marked by one
conspicuous exception, Chinese laundries were
burned and Chinese maltreated. The solid business
of the community was endangered. Residences were
filled with trembling women and guarded by indignant
husbands and fathers. But after a few preliminary
demonstration? Nob Hill was safe, and railroad
tracks, cars, engines and offices were untouched. In
fact, it became apparent before and when the sandlot
sed its boisterous existence that between it and the
railroad monopoly there was a reciprocity of protec
tion. The subsequent careers of the most aggressive
â  â  monstrated" the friendly relations that
been predicted long before they were revealed.
The analogy between the objects of the railroad and
the sandlot was striking. The difference consisted in
methods and in results." Like the marauding barons
; ;c Middle Ages, the railroad marched upon the
people arid appropriated their substance. Its descents
Its collections, however, were noiseless and un
ompanied by banners, by artillery and by clanking
â  tor. It preferred the gentler processes of bossing
md buying Supervisors and Legislatures, and
cf silencing competition and clamor by strategy and
by fraud, skillfully operated through a trained army
erccnaries. The sandlot merely substituted force
for management. Both equally aspired to overrule
the law and both equally despised the restraints of
: order and of justice. Each aimed at the accumulation
'oi unearned increments. But the railroad believed in
nitration, while the sandlotters howled for dis
tribution. Of the two institutions, united by a com
mon purpose, it was difficult to determine which was
the worse in principle, while it became easy to award
the palm to railroad success and the cypress to sand
lot failure.
The infelicity of allusions to the sandlot in rail
road organs is apparent. The comparisons they sug
gest are too odorous. Most of the sandlotters are
dead or scattered, and many of them, temporarily de
ceived, have reformed and are now sturdy workers in
the ranks of genuine industry. The survivors of the
unfittest, however, are still obstreperous and blatant
in those legislative and municipal lobbies which toil
I for Mr. Huntington when Dan Burns runs for Sen
i ator or half of a city is to be grabbed.
The personalities of the sandlot have ceased, but
the railroad personalities, with its ledger accounts and
j its balances of hostility and subserviency, remain.
Still the monopoly pursues its ancient methods, and
t still it deludes itself with faith in its capacity for uni
; versal dominance. But the world has grown larger
than it was in the days of the sandlot. San Francisco
has ceased to be an overgrown village and enjoys
| the self-consciousness of metropolitan strength.
There are capitalists lure allied to American industry
and who can infuse vigor into competition. At the
East there are Vanderbilts as well as Huntingtons.
The young giant of Western Americanism is inhaling
Strong air of the Pacific and swelling his power
ful muscles as he confronts the shrunken figure of
â¢ ased monopoly. It would be safer for Mr. Hun
tington to restrain the yellow platitudes of his literary
i bureau and to pay strict attention to his solar plexus.
OPPORTUNITIES FOR LAW OFFICERS.
ALL other appropriations of illegal authority,
by direct and indirect usurpation, have been
dwarfed by the intricate records of the
Huntington monopoly. And the history of the
Market Street Railway Company is another
nant example of the same illegal and in
jurious assumption and extension of chartered
rights. That monopoly, which consolidated eleven
street railway companies, which has since acquired
other properties and which has just fraudulently
sought to steal what there was left of our local streets
and easements, filed its certificate .of incorporation
October 13, iK<j,?. It^- watering of stock and its issue
of bonds are not pertinent to this discussion. But,
by the enumeration of powers in its certificate, it was
I limited to the acquisition and operation of street
I railways in San Francisco and in the county of San
Mateo. In various ways, and with utter disregard of
legal disabilities, it has usurped privileges to which
it had no more claim than to the running of steam
ship lines to the Philippines.
One illustration will serve our purpose: Its ad
vertising business alone, over its entire network of
railway lines, is so extensive that it must net an
enormous yearly profit. Without even the pretense
of legality, it competes not merely with the press but
with every other recognized mode of attracting busi
ness. Its cars are advertising booths, requiring the
services of a special agency, and it carries bands on
some of our principal streets as musical solicitations
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JUNE 4, 1899.
to the public. This usurped extension of its legiti
mate functions it has deliberately adopted, with the
same indurated disregard for law as it manifested in
the exactions it thrust before the people through its
special agents in the Board of Supervisors. -
Near Chicago, in the State of Illinois, the Pullman
I Palace Car Company, for the exclusive accommoda
tion of its own employes, built a town of two thou
sand houses. Within a few months, under quo war
ranto proceedings, the Supreme Court of that State
has withdrawn the legal foundation from that private
j municipality, because, notwithstanding the plausible
j reasons assigned by the company for its assertion of
the right to house, feed, clothe and amuse its ser
vants at their own expense, the authority for the
claim did not exist in its charter. The opinion of the
court, published in volume 175 of the Illinois Reports,
J pages 127-165, is solid in every line, and emphati
cally declares that the Pullman Company could not
incidentally monopolize receipts and profits that be
longed to the people.
A little of this drastic treatment extended to the
State and municipal despotism of Mr. Huntingdon
would probably induce him to concentrate his atten
tion upon the preservation of what he has and to re
lieve our citizens from the need of constant watchful
ness over such public rights and property as have
not been already appropriated.
THE STANFORD ENDOWMENT.
\A RS. STANFORD'S gift to the university
/ \ founded in memory of her son is undoubtedly
the most munificent act of liberality in Ameri
can history. It has no equal in any land except that
recently made by the will of the late Baroness de
Hirsch, and in history will be even more notable
than that, for the Hirsch millions are to be scattered
far and wide and* will have no great name anywhere,
while those of Mrs. Stanford will be centered in an
institution destined to become one of the most re
nowned seats of learning on earth.
It is well known that for some time past the growth
and development of Stanford University have been
seriously retarded by lack of means to provide for
them. The vast fortune now placed at the disposal of
the president and trustees will enable them to enter
at nnce upon every important work the university re
quires. New buildings are in process of construction,
new equipments can be obtained, the faculty enlarged
and the whole institution animated to an increased
activity in all its departments.
So marked will be the change produced in the af
f;iirs of the university by the gift that something like
a new departure in its history will he dated from this
ume.- We are now to have the satisfaction of watch
ing the development of a "Greater Stanford," and
from what has been accomplished in the past ample
n-^urances are given that the results of the future will
be notable for successes in many ways.
The munificent gift is the more interesting because
it coincides in point of time with the movement now
.mder way to build up a "Greater University of Cali
fornia." The magnificent plans outlined by the Re
gents of the State University, and SO generously sup
ported by Mrs. Hearst, hardly surpass those actually
undertaken and now well advanced at Stanford. We
fire, therefore, in the near future, t<l have in California
the two most beautiful and most stately university
seats in America, if not in the world. Nor will their
eminence lie dependent upon their architecture and
equipments only. It cannot be doubted that they will
attract the most gifted teachers in all -departments of
1< ;u -ning, and from them will radiate an intellectual
light even more luminous than that which in times
past has proceeded from Harvard and Yale and made
New England the center of American culture.
Mrs. Stanford has followed the example of her
husband and bestowed her gift during her lifetime,
instead of waiting to 'leave it by will after her death.
In doing so she has acted not only wisely but with a
true liberality of soul. The people oi California owe
her much, and the debt will increase from generation
to generation.
TESTIMONY FROM THE ISLANDS.
AMONG the imperialists and the annexationists
it is a favorite boast that by making Hawaii
and the Philippines a part of our territory we
shall open up new fields for white labor and provide
American workingmen with opportunities to make
homes for themselves in the islands of the ocean and
i erect there commonwealths as noted for liberty, law
1 and prosperity as are tin we that make up the Union.
The Call has repeatedly exposed the folly and in
sr:mc instances the criminal falseness of these state
: ments. We have now to add to our argument testi
ttiony on the subject, direct from the islands. In the
course of a review of the labor situation the Honolulu
'independent of May 17 says: '"Mr. Damon is one â 
1 of the kindest and most conservative employers of la
bor, and yet we are told that a number of his re
cently impoj-ted Italian laborers tried to 'clear out' in
the Australia yesterday, and that Mr. Damon had to
use the existing laws' and the police to stop the men
who are under contract to him."
In another note on the same, subject, and dealing
always with specific instances and not with abstract
propositions, the Independent says: "We daily sec a
lnrce number of Galicians in the chain gang working
at the quarries and on the roads. They are white
men; they are the class that our philanthropist of the
official organ wants to make the sinew and bone of
these islands as 'small (d â â d small) farmers,' and yet
they prefer to remain under the tender care of Mr.
Dole's jailer to returning to slavery on a plantation."
Return-ing to the subject on the following day, the
Independent declares the .Government is doing all in
its power to force planters to inveigle white laborers
to the islands, and it then goes on to say: "The day
is gone by when that could be done, because the slav
ery on Hawaii's plantations is known all over the
civilized world. L'Orange years ago induced a num
ber of Norwegian laborers to come here by telling
them that gold was lying around the roads â and he
had to flee the country while the Norwegian Govern
ment rent a special commissioner to Honolulu. The
poor Galicians who are parading our streets in prison
pirb came here under equally false pretenses."
That is the record of white labor in Hawaii as it
stands now. Italian workingmen who were induced
to go to the islands are seeking to escape from the
employ of one of the kindest of Hawaiian employers,
while others are working as prisoners in criminal garb
on the streets. Whether that of white workingmen or
! Chinese coolie, the labor is hardly better than that of
serfdom, but still, as the Independent puts it, the cry
goes on: "Send for more laborers! If we can't get
I Japanese get Italians, and if we can't get Americans
let us have Spaniards â anything will do as long as
more plantations are promoted."
The dispatches announce that General Merriam
may now do as he pleases, as the courts of Idaho have
refused to recognize writs of habeas corpus. The
autocratic soldier seems to have been enjoying the
privilege of doing as he liked ever since he placed a
censorship on the press.
Herrin and his hirelings* can put those rejected
franchises in their pipes and str.oke them.
EDITORIAL VARIATIONS.
BY JOHN McNfJUGHT.
According to one of the laborious cor
respondents to whose toll the people of
this country are indebted for their
knowledge of European affairs, the
Czar of Russia is not satisfied "with
either his empire, his epoch, his work
or himself. He is reported to have re
cently said that civilized man has
woven around him in his civilization so
many customs, conventionalities, pro
prieties, etiquettes and artificial re
strictions of all kinds that he no longer
has freedom either for good work or
Joyous pleasure; that all he undertakes
Is sure to end in failure and that no
life worth living Is possible for serf or
sovereign.
About tho time that report concern^
ing the Czar was tilling space in the
papers there came a story of a Denver
man who, having been told by his
physicians that one lung is gone and
his days of life are few, turned all his
property into cash, left his beloved wife
and hastened to Chicago to have a good
time before he died. When found by
the pursuing wife he was in a glorious
state of hilarity, with dancing girls
around him, singing gay songs over the
remnants of what had been a delectable
feast.
The two stories taken together form
a good basis for a merry philosophy.
The first teaches that if one submit to
the bondage of society he can have no
fullness of life, even though he wear
a crown and be an autocrat; while the
second shows that even a one-lunged,
dying man may find his short life a
continual round of varied joys if he
break away from duty, as a butterfly
breaks from a chrysalis, and emanci
pate himself tj do what he will, when
he will and how he will to satisfy his
thirst and gratify his soul.
Count Leo Tolstoi has told us there
are three religions in the world and
only three; there never were any more,
there never can be any less; and every
intelligent being is compelled by the
very law of his intelligence to believe
one of the three. The dogma is based
upon the self-evident truth that every
intelligent being is conscious of the ex
istence of itself and of something which
is not itself, and necessarily forms
some Judgment concerning the relation
which the one bears to the other.
The self is th'? soul, and that which is
not self is the universe, and there are
but three conceivable relations between
them. It may be assumed that the soul
is supreme and has a right to use the
universe for its pleasure or Its profit;
or that the established order of the uni
verse is supreme and the soul must con
form to its laws; or that there is a
power above both the soul and the uni
verse, to which the soul must surrender
itself and which it must obey though
such obedience imply not only the sac
rifice of the desires of the heart, but
the breaking of all laws of existing in
stitutions.
The Czar believes his soul to be sub
ordinate to the established order of
things; he will bear life as a weary
burden rather than be false to his duty
to his crown, his station and his state.
The Denver man believes the world to
be a garden wherein his sovereign soul
has right to every fruit and flower it
can gather. Tolstoi believes that both
are sinners, for he would sacrifice em
pins arid pleasures, duties and drinks,
to divinity with an equal willingness.
There is no need for any one to fret
this Sunday morning in trying to de
termine which is right. Let us re
member the saying of the prayer book:
"\W are all miserable sinners," and
put away any si ggostion of the devil
that while each is a sinner the Denver
man is having the best time.

Mrs. Stanford's decree that the num
ber of wn.ncn students at Stanford
University shall never exceed f>oo at any
time is one of the most curious re
strictions that has been placed in these
days upon the aspiring ambitions of
nur girls. There is danger it appears
that Stanford might become something
like a woman's college, with girls
enough to form a woman's rights con
vention every day, but not men enough
to organize a football team once a year.
The right of Mrs. Stanford to regulate
hor family monu.nent in any way that
suits her taste is not to be questioned.
Those who have swag may swagger as
they please. The public interest in the
question lies in the new proof thus
given of the force with which women
are pushing their way into the more-
Intellectual walkc of life. They are not
crowding men out, for the paths of
learning are oper. to all and are broad
enough for all but they are Hocking in
while the men are staying out. Just
why that should be objected to is not
so clear to tho < utside world as it is
to those within the charmed university
circle. That ho institution would lose
prestige if it lost its football team Is,

of course, very well understood in
sporting circles, but why should it lose
its team? Why not fill the faculty
with football men? The thing is
feasible.
The first effect of the restriction will
be to make every girl in California
more eager to so to Stanford than ever
before. Tho style of the Four Hundred
of New York will be as nothing to tho
amount of â¢'queen" that will be swung
by the Five Hundred of Falo Alto. As
there will be a Hmit on the number of
campus belles and promenade chums
the rivalry among the unlimited males
will be keener than ever, and the last
state of that co-educating monument
to railroad opportunities will be worse

The story of Mark Twain's interview
with the Emperor of Austria, as given
In the cable dispatches, may be ac
curate enough, but it bears the ear
marks of a Mark Twain Joke. The
story goes that Mark prepared in
choice German a pretty speech to make
to his Majesty, but when ushered into
the royal presence became so much em
barrassed he forgot what he was going
to say, fluttered in the tongue of him
and stood flabbergasted and dumb.
It is to be remembered the story Is
founded upon a report given by Mark
and not by the Emperor. Hence the
ample justification for all the incredul
ity the public 'may choose to indulge.
Mr. Twain is the man who told us long
ago that truth is the most valuable pos
session we have, and therefore we
ought to economise it. It is a maxim
he has practiced more diligently than
he has preached It, and it is probable
he has never given away a truth in tho
whole course of his humorous career.
If Mark fluttered in the presence of
the Emperor it is safe to say he did so
for the purpose of concealing the New
Haven accent or his German speech
and was playing it low on his Majesty â
running a bluff on a King as It were â
but the chances are nothing of the kind
occurred. When we get to the end of
the episode we shall probably find Mark
has been playing the press and the
public and has worked a thrifty scheme
to get an advance advertisement for a
forthcoming 1 magazine article. The
gentle joker is a creature who always
bears watching, for there is never any
telling when his joke is on you.
For many days we had with us a con
vention of Baptist ministers, exulting
in the consciousness of an overruling
Providence, 'preaching eloquently the
tenets of a sublime faith and filling the
city with prayer and holy song for the
edification of all. From height to
height the convention mounted until at
last it reached a climax and culmin
ated. The next day we had a north
east storm, an earthquake, a suicide
and two murders; and immediately
thereafter, perhaps by coincidence
merely, the teachers of trust in Provi
dence who had come to us from a dis
tance took their gripsacks and shook
the dust of the city from their feet.
The latest novelty In applied science
is a new trifk In Parisian dueling. M.
Catulle Mendea and M. Georges Vanar
agreed to fiVht with rapiers about
something which is not interesting in
asmuch as the name of the woman has
not even been hinted in the reports that
come to us. They further agreed that
while willing to risk the rage and the
skill of one another, they were not will
ing to risk microbes. Accordingly it
was stipulated that the weapons were
to be thoroughly subjected to antisep
tic treatment before the fight began,
and that whenever one of them touched
the pround the combat was to be Im
mediately suspended until the blade
had been passed through the flame of
an alcohol lamp so as to destroy any
stray germs of tetanus that might ad
here to the steel.
It is not worth while to consider what
Cyrano de Borgorac or d'Artignan
-would have thought of puch duelling
regulations as that. The point of in
terest is. that the French are more
careful of health in their dueling than
we are in our dining. There are more
dangers in American canned goods than
in Parisian challenges, and they have
better cause to smile at us than we to
laugh at them.

At the risk of bringing down upon my
head the manuscript versos of all the
singers of the commonwealth, I sub
mit a bit of rhymed unreason which
for sheer audacity is equal to anything
ever done in English since the days of
Blake. It came to me without a title,
and I will give it none, but it Is surely
entitled to a reading":
There was a man all warped and gnarled
Who nosed about and growled and
snarled:
"The worlds all made of sin," he said,
"We'll go to hell when we are dead;
Roses really smell like skunks;
Women are fools and mea are drunks."
And then he shriveled up and died.
Hell laughed, but all the angels cried.
There was a maid just like a flower.
Who sang glad songs each passing hour.-Â«
"Oh, what a glorious world is this,
Where all is love, and love is bliss;
Not one soul but's really true;
All do the best they know to do!"
Then hell to heaven quickly sprang.
And devils and angels together sang.
The audacities of those versos are
many. In the first place even the poet
who described a woman as "a rag and
a bone and a hank of hair" would
hardly venture to use such words as
"drunks" and "skunks" in serious
verse, and the assertion, "the angels
cried." is bad enough to make the an
gels weep: but tho crowning audacity
of the whole, and that which gives it
the glow of something liko an inspira
tion of true genius, is the declaration
that the song of a girl who had just
discovered that love is bliss caused all
holl to rise and join heaven in a grand
song and dance of jubilation.
Truly there is much merit in the
verses, Danton has told us "audacity,
audacity and always audacity ' is the
essential element of eloquence in ora
tory: and why is it not equally so in
verse? One thing is certain: If the
anonymous writer of that rough and
ready rhapsody have many more such
happy audacities to fling in the face of
critics and sing into the hearts of lov
ers, California will awake some fine
to the knowledge that she has another
poet. /

IT CAN'T BE DONE.
No One Can Remain Well, No
Chronic Disease Can Be Cured
Unless the Stomach Is
First v a de Strong and
ViÂ£orou<*.
This is plain because every orÂ£an in
the body depends on the stomach for its
nourishment. Nerve, bone, sinew, blood
are made from the food which the sto-
mach converts to our use.
How useless to treat disease with
this, that and the other remedy and
neglect the most important of all, the
stomach.
The earliest symptoms of indigestion
are sour risings, bad taste in the
mouth, gas in stomach and bowels, pal-
pitation, all-gone feeling, faintriess,
headaches, constipation; later comes
loss of flesh, consumption, liver and
heart troubles, kidney diseases, nervous
prostration, all of which are the indirect
result of poor nutrition.
Any person suffering from indigestion
should make it a practice to take after
each meal one of Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets, allowing it to dissolve in the
mouth and thus mingle with the saliva
and enter the stomach in the- most nat-
ural way. These Tablets are highly
recommended by Dr. Jennison because
they are composed of the natural di-
gestive acids and fruit essences which
assist the stomach In digesting all
wholesome food before it has time to
ferment and sour.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are sold
by druggists, full sized packages at 50
cents. They are also excellent for in-
valids and children. A book on stomach

DR. LORIMER CONTRADICTED.
Alleged False Statements Made by
Him on Missionary Questions.
Dr. George C. Lorimer, the Eastern
Baptist divine who was recently in this
city, made some statements which have
been emphatically contradicted by com
bined forces of Presbyterians and Congro
gationallsts. He has been accused of man
ufacturing data with which to embellish
his speeches arid render them more at
tractive to his audiences. Not only does
the wave of indignation created by his
statements roll from congregations pro
fessing beliefs at variance with his own,
bin Dr. H. C. Mabie, the secretary ot'
the American Baptist Foreign Missionary
I'iron and an adherent of his own laith,
tiikej. him to task for his assertions.
:>r. Lorimer declared that it cost the
Piesbyterians (232 to convert a heathen,
the Congregatlonalists $176 and the Bap
tists only $17 52.
!\ the layman these figures would seem
to Indicate that the Baptists are valiant
champions in the art of bringing the gos>
p< 1 into the heart of the savage, or That
other religious denominations squander
tile money which has been collected at
home for the propagation of Christian

Dr. Mabie, the Baptist Missionary Un
ion's secretary, does not think that his
denomination is much in advance of other
on the Side at the Annual
religions in dealing with savages, and Dr. |
Ira M. Condlt, superintendent of the Pres
byterian Chinese Missions on the Pacific
Coast, has this to say regarding: Dr. Lorl
mer's conclusions:
It Is a shame for him to quote such fljnires.
They do the other denominations an injustice
and misrepresent us before the public. It Is

Sarah Carrolson, a widow, and the
mother of nine children", the young
est 15 months and the eldest 15 years of
age, was brought before Judge Cook yes

charge of mayhem. All of her youngsters
occupied a bench near the dock, and wept
:in unison when their childish minds
j finally grasped their mother's plight.
A few months ago Mrs. Carrolson be
| came the enemy of Mrs. Mary Maddigan,
i who resides on Natoma street. The more
i Mrs. Carrolson thought of the comely
looks of Mrs. Maddigan the more she re
solved to put a blemish on the same. A
few weeks ago she called on Mrs. Maddi
gan and without explanation assaulted
her. A rough and tumble fight ensued,
and at the end Mrs. Maddigan found that
she was minus a large portion of her up
per lip. Mrs. Carrolson had bitten it
away, and for the shocking crime was
forthwith arrested and charged with
mayhem. She was convicted, and yes
terday Judge Cook pronounced sentence.

EMIL SAUER AND THE PIANOLA
THE GREAT VIRTUOSO PREDICTS
A FUTURE FOR THE AGE-
END PIANO PLAYER.
The Famous Pianist Visits the Ware
rooms of the Aeolian Company
to Hear the Pianola.
Mr. Saver, accompanied by Mr. Ernest
Knabe, Mr. William Knabe and Mr. Vic
tor Thrane, after listening to and playing
the Pianola, submitted to an Interview
which is accurately reported as follows:
"It is really wonderful. I can freely say
the Pianola gives me more pleasure than
I have had from thousands of so-called
treats of pianistic effort.
"I have heard a great many musical in
ventions, but the Pianola is the first
which has a reason for existing.
"It is sure to ha%-e a future. This is my
candid opinion. You know an artist often
has to assist a struggling brother with
words of praise a little exaggerated, but
in this case it is different. When I say
that the Pianola has a musical future I
am talking about something I really be
lieve in.
"It plays 'La Campanella' of Liszt, and
other pieces which call primarily for tech
nical evenness, in really good style and
with a technique fairly astonishing. No
pianist could approach it.
"Of course in romantic or sentimental
music, in what I should call erotic music,
it must he less satisfactory, as the per
sonality or individuality of the player
Counts for so much more in music of this
class.
"As I say, it will have a musical future.
I want you to send one to my home in
Dresden. Here is a card which gives my
address: Hahnelstrasse 8, Dresden, Ger
many. As soon as it arrives I shall give
a reception to all the best musical people.
No musician can help admiring it."
Do you think there is anything to be
said about its usefulness to musicians and
composers and for musical purposes gen
erally?
"I certainly do think there is a great i
deal to be said. Why. it will be of prac
tical service to me, and I fully Intend to
employ it in that way. You see, 1 often
have to practice a piece for two weeks
and get it well under my hands before I
can tell whether or not I can create an
effect with it. Sometimes I find that no
satisfactory effect can be produced, and
so lose my time and labor. For it is la T
bor. Now. the Pianola would tell me this
in two minutes."
Mr. Saver was much pleased with the
rendition of his "Am Bache." but com
plained that the "Espenlaub" could not
be played rapidly enough. It was then
tried oh another instrument with a faster
motor and plaÂ«ved at correct tempo.
"I wish you would cut my 'Murmures
de Vent'"' added Mr. Saver. "and also
my 'Galop de Concert.' They ought to be
just the things to be effective. You also
ought to have Balakirew's Oriental fan
-1 tasie, 'Islamei.' It is a horribly difficult
i work, but the Pianola would play It beau-
Mr Saver was asked what he thought
about the usefulness of the instrument to
composers.
"I can see how your instrument must
ai.l the cause of the composer," he re
plied "In disseminating a knowledge of
his music. As it is now, hundreds of mer
itorious compositions cannot gf>t a hear
ing consequently no one knows anything
about them. Some of these pieces get one
hearing. But that is not enough. Real
! music to be appreciated must be heard
! again and again."
Before leaving Mr. Saver expressed his
appreciation again, congratulating the
' company for having produced the first
successful musical invention, and added,
humorously. "You American inventors
will kill our profession. The artists of the
future will have a hard time of it. In ten
years there will be no more virtuosi. No
"player can do what that instrument has
just dene. It is not possible."
On Sunday afternoon a representative
of the Aeolian Company played for Mr.
Saver in his moms at the Hotel Savoy
and strengthened the impressions of the
previous day.
Statement of Kmil Saver:
"I have examined all the pages of this
article with care. With some alterations
in the order of the statements, it agrees
with my recollection of the interview. At
any rate it expresses my views with ac
curacy " (Signed) EMIL SAUER.

LAWYERS' FEES
WILL BE PAID
BY DEPUTIES
Preparations for the
Charter Suit.
SCHEME TO RAISE FUNDS
AN ASSESSMENT WILL BE LEV
IED SOON.
Some Believe That a Full Month's
Salary Will Be Demanded by
the Officials, but This
Is Denied.
The firm of Rodgers, Patereon & Slack
and Attorney George D. Collins have been
retained by County Clerk Deane, Sheriff
Martin, Recorder Berthier, District Attor
ney Murphy and other members of the
combine organized to test the validity of
certain measures incorporated in the new
charter limiting the tenure of all the
county office holders. Just what figure
these attorneys will demand from the
office holders for representing them in the
important litigation remains to be seen,
but various rumors are causing consider
able anxiety among the host of deputies
at the present time. By some it is said
i that each and every deputy in the various
offices will be taxed one month's salary to
meet the expenses of the litigation! but if
such were the case the attorneys for their
labors would receive a sum that would
reach in the neighborhood of 125,000, the
County Clerk's office alone representing
$8000 of this sum.
Those best in a position to know, how
ever, say that the alarm of the deputies
is premature. That an assessment will
be made none deny, but it will be far
below the figure named. Five thousand
dollars will amply meet all court expenses
and attorney fees, they say, and on this
basis a 10 per cent assessment on all sala
ries will net sufficient funds to liquidate
all obligations arising out of the litiga
tion.
In defense of the proposed assessment
levy the officials point to the fact that
it is as much to the interest of the depu
ties as to the officials to test the validity
of the measures limiting the tenure of
the officials, for, they say, if the officials
must step out. so must the deputies. An
other campaign must be made, and cam
paigns are more expensive than reasonable
litigation. If the outlay of a few dollars
on the part of each deputy is required,
none, the officials say, can complain, for
th*>ir interests are centered in a final de
cision on the involved issues. Whether it
will please them, or not, or whether or not
any man among them is unwilling to give
up a few dollars to possibly secure a posi
tion for himself for three more years, an
assessment will be levied, but it will not
be as large as some fear. It will not de
prive them of thPir gold earned by the
I labor of thirty days.
GRIGSBY WRITES TO
HIS LATEST VICTIM
THE EX - SOLDIER BIGAMIST
PROMISES TO RETURN.
Sends a "Barrel of Kisses" to Wife
Number Three From Denver â No
References to Charges
Against Him.
Ex-Sergeant Willis O. Grlgsby, late of
the United States array, who is warned
by the authorities of two counties for
bigamy, has been heard from again. His
third victim. Miss Nova Wood of Bakers
field, who is at present stopping- in this
city, and who enjoys the unenviable dis
tinction of being Mrs. Grigsby No. 3, re
ceived' a letter from Grigsby yesterday
and promptly communicated the fact to
Postal Inspector Irwin, who Is anxious
to locate the ex-soldier in order to ask
him a few questions concerning his llli
gal use of Government stamped envelopes
in his private correspondence.
The letter was dated Denver, May 31,
and bore a Denver postmark, in addition
to the postmark of some small town in
the vicinity of the Colorado capital, which
could not be deciphered. The recreant
husband wrote gushingly of his love tor
his "little wife," and inclosed the usual
"barrel of kisses" with which he seema
to have impartially favored all his dupes
whenever he communicated with them.
He made no reference to the charges
against him. but said he intended to con
tinue on his journey to Covington, Ky.,
where he was going to "close up his
father's estate," and if all went well ho
expected to return to San Francisco in
about ten days.
Inspector Irwin took possession of the
letter and telegraphed to the Inspector at
Denver immediately. The police of that
city were also notified to arrest the man
if he could be found. He is hardly likely
to be in that city now, however, although
Miss Wood believes he has spent all his
money by this time and re-enlisted in the
army. Inspector Irwin thinks that the
letter was mailed from some small town
near Denver. It is believed that Grlgsbv
will be apprehended before many days
and brought back to the coast to face his
victims and perhaps answer to chargers
to be preferred against him by the postal
authorities.
SUNDAY-SCHOOL PICNIC.
Presbytery of San Francisco Gives
Little Ones an Outing.
Several hundred youngsters had a gala
time at Fairfax Park yesterday. The oc
casion was the annual outing of the Pres
byterian Sunday-schools of San Fran
cisco, and the early trains were taxed to
their utmost capacity in handling the
crowds of little tots who held tickets for
the day's pleasure. An early start was
made and most of the children departed
on the 7 o'clock boat. Those who left on
the 8 o'clock boat were obliged to stop at
San Anselmo until 9:30.
Each child was provided with a lunch,
and the arrival of the noon hour was re
garded as one of the principal events of
the -trip. During the day games of all
descriptions were played and many of the
merrymakers carried home valuable
prizes, the result of their superiority in
the contests. Running races and all ath
letic sports composed a large part of the
programme.
The picnic was given under the aus
pices of the Sabbath-School Association
of the Presbytery of San Francisco and
was under the direct supervision of a
committee headed by Rev. R. W. Rey
nolds, the pastor of Lebanon Presbyterian
Church. It was more than a success and
praise was showered on the management
for its clever arrangement of details.
Each class was chaperoned by its teacher,
the list of which is as follows: First

ANOTHER LIEBES SUIT.
Decedent's Divorced Wife Alleges
That She Was Victimized.
Suit was filed yesterday afternoon by
Mrs. Hannah Liebes against George. Syd
ney and Herman Liebes and Nathan
Meyer, executors of the will of the late
Herman Liebes. the deceased divorced
husband of the plaintiff, to recover $80,726,
alleged to be due her from decedent's
estate.
In her complaint Mrs. Liebes alleges
that in February of 1892, while divorce
proceedings she had instituted were pend
ing, an agreement was entered into be
tween herself and her husband by which
the deceased agreed to divide all of the
community property and give her one
half, to which she was entitled under the
law. A statement was made her by
Liebes. she continues, in which he placed
the value of the community property at
$125,545, among the assets being two shares
of the capital stock of the firm of Herman '
Liebes & Co. The division was made
and through the California Safe Deposit
and Trust Company she was paid $60,000,
the balance of her share going to pay
expenses of the transaction.
Mrs. Liebes says that she now finds that
her. divorced husband fraudulently repre- J
sented the value of the community prop
erty, which in fact at the time of the I
agreement was worth $290,000, and in
cluded 1650 shares of the capital stock of
the firm of H. Liebes & Co. Hence she '

was conversing with a female com
panion in Smool a saloon at McAllister
and l^arkin streets last Thursday even

The latter was standing against the bar,
and as Jackson emerged from the rear
room he claims he was assailed by a vol

son, so he asserts, called the policeman
to account, whereupon the latter struck
him in the face with his clenched list,
knocking him against the wall. Bruised
and bleeding, Jackson Quickly regained

was no â ;,..â  for his assailant, lie

charging Pendergast with having assauit

sent for Pendergast and asked for an ex

Jackson. He declared he was not even
acquainted with him and did not meet
him on the night that he claims he was
assaulted. Convinced that Jackson was
mistaken in the identification of the as

and asked him if he was positive that
Pendergast was the man who bad as
saulted him. He explained that he had

A PLAIN ROMANCE IN
SPIRITUALISTIC CIRCLES
I ROMANCE in spiritualistic circles was uncovered yesterday through the
A marriage of Dr. Charles H. Rines to Countess Cary M. Peterson. The
f-\ ceremony was performed by Justice of the Peace Dunn at his cham
â *â  â *â  bers in the City Hall, and was unattended by any of the pomp and
ceremony that ordinarily marks the nuptials of a Countess. When all was
over and the Ju<it-^ had pronounced them man and wife the aged bridegroom
went back to his office and resumed the business of reading the past, pres
ent and future through the medium of the forearms of his clients, and his
the Countess, sat for company in the antechamber to the consulta
tion room.
"He likes me and I like him, so we got married," was the simple expla
n given by the Countess when asked to relate the details of her ro
mance. It may be to her credit that it was not she that made known the
that may be hers by right of birth. It was the proud and happy hus
band who revealed this secret. To be sure, he explained that his wife was
In Norway, where titles are plentiful and money scarce; but he was
rtain that she was a Countess.
Dr. *Rlnes is 66 years old and his wife is just forty years his junior. They
met some months ago at a spiritualistic seance. During the intervals of
their communion with the spirits of another world they had time to think
â¢ Time, Cupid Danforth and Judge Dunn did the rest. The Countess
,i widow, and this is her husband's third matrimonial venture.
Dr. Panes is- the president of the Independent Free Thought Bible Spir
itualists. He is also an ordained minister and a "magnetic and spiritual
r." The newly married couple will reside at 261 Arlington street, which
may be reached by obeying the following instructions copied from the
doctor's business card:
Take the Mission street cars; pet off at St. Mary's street; cross over the
railroad fence; third house on tli. left. Or take the San Mateo cars; get off
at No. 2 switch; t;' l down the bill; turn to the left; first house on the right.
PEACE REIGNS AGAIN
AMONG LOCAL EAGLES
THREATENED SECESSION DID
NOT TAKE PLACE.
The Trouble Caused by a Handful of
Members Who Desired to Run
Things to Suit Them
selves.
The threatened secession in the San |
Francisco Aerie. Fraternal Order of]
s, did not materialize at Friday
night's meeting. When it came to a
"show-down" the Becessloi "cold
feet," to us.- the language of one of the
loyal Eagles, and th< question was not
. lit up. I' appears that the or
der al asj lal meeting held a few days
since decided bj a majority vote to remain
with the Beattle Grand Lodge, the per
sonnel of wnose members had been re
i as not what it should be. At all
events the bolters have become subdued
and the defection, if any, will be very
small.
nd L-cturer H. H. Thompson arrived
from Seattlt and attended Friday's meet
ing. He was given a cordial reception, and
to offset the unfavorable report of the San
Francisco delegates stated that Seattle
Aerie, the mother lodge, numbers among
Its members ~t> Masons, 08 Odd Fellows, all
the Red Men ii) Beattle excepting five, 12
Elks and 275 professional men, artisans
;uid laborers.
As an evidence that the local aerie i 3
not on the verge of dissolution seventeen
new members were initiated, and there
are a score of applicants for admission.
Charges of treason are pending against
several of the intending bolters, and it Is
probable that they will not be given the
opportunity to resign, but will be expelled
from the order.
According to one of the prominent mem
bera who was at all times opposed to the
ndment proposition Ban Francisco
Aerie is on a solid and lasting basis.
"The withdrawal of a few members,"
he says, "who signally failed to run
things to suit themselves and for their
own personal advancement 1b to be re
garded more in the light of good news
than a possible disaster."
All for Charity.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JUNE 4, 1899.
KILLING OF SEALS
SUDDENLY STOPPED
HUNTERS RECALLED FROM GOV
ERNMENT RESERVATIONS.
Federal Officials Induced to Revoke
the Permission by a Number of
Eastern Scientists.
A halt, as sudden as it was unexpected, I
has been called in the destruction of the
sea lion herds on the Government light
house reservations. A month or co ago
the authorities at "Washington granted
permission to the California State Fish
and Game Commissioners to land d-eputies
on the big island rookeries for the pur
pose of thinning out the vest seal herds
which are destroying so many thousands
of fish every year. Yesterday this per
mission was withdrawn, the commission
nng the following letter from Cao
t:un Bebree, the Lighthouse Inspector of
this district:
The following is a copy of a telegram
received this day from the Lighthouse
Board:
'â¢WASHINGTON, D. C. May 31. 1599.
Lighthouse Inspector, San Francisco,
< .1!.: Board suspends authority con
tained in letter o, April 27 to land dep
uties to kill sea lions, till further or
ders. PERRY, Naval Secretary."
In compliance with tne above you
are Informed t.iat the authority to
keep deputies mi the lighthouse reser
vations at Farallon and Âuevo islands
for the purpose of killing a part of the
sea lions is suspended and you are re
quested to recall the deputies as soon
as they can be notified. I will notify
the keepers to send the deputies off
the reservations upon the tirst oppor
tunity.
Tho Commissioners are satisfied as to
the persons who inspired this action on
the part of the Lighthouse Board at
Washington. For the past two weeks a
1 number of letters have been received from
: a Mr. Shields, the editor of an Eastern
Journal, and others, protesting against the
destruction of the sea lions upon purely
sentimental grounds. These protests were
seconded by Dr. C. Hart Marriam, a sci
: entist and vice president of the League of
American Sportsmen at Washington
These gentlemen compared the destruc
tion of the sea lions to that 01 the buf
falo and antelope. President A. T Vogel
sang answered the letters politely hut
I forcefully to the effect that the protest
, ants were evidently not well Informed
!on tho subject of their concern. This Is
1 no doubt the hand that wielded the club
t President Vogelsang yesterday wrote a
, long letter to Secretary of the Treasury
j L. T. Gage, calling attention to the ex
pense that has entailed in fitting out the
expeditions against the sea lions, with the
permission of the Government. Also that
the movement against these sea animals
has received the indorsement and approv
al of the commercial and scientific men of
the coast. And further, that the State
and the United States are spending thou
sands nf dollars every year to foster and
i build up the salmon industry. Into which
the sea robbers are ma>x.n -"â  such disas
; trous inroads. He concluded by request
ing that the order of revocation' be recon
sidered and permission again granted
Deputy Al Wilson and an assistant are
on the Farallones and Captain Scott and
two assistants are on the Ano Nuevo
Islands, but so far they have not been
able to destroy many of the seals. They
have been recalled.
Mrs. Clark's Death.
Denis Kearney called at the Morgue
yesterday to make arrangements for the
interment of Mrs. Dorothy Clark, who
committed suicide last Friday by taking
carbolic acid in the Mansfield House at
210 Post street. Mr. Kearney informs* tli^
Morgue officials that she was the daugh

Her mother died In this city^everal years

Federation of Improvement Clubs
Wants Southern Pacific to Build
Its Bay Shore Line.
The Federation "of Mission Improvement
CluhÂ£ will not permit any grass to grow
under Its feet in tightening the screws
on the Southern Pacific Railroad Com
pany. At the meeting of that body held
last night at Fairmount Hall a resolu
tion was passed instructing the District
Attorney to at once commence proceed
ings against the monopoly to remove its
tracks along the line from Third and
Townsend streets to the county line.
The following is the resolution as
passed: -;â  -<
Resolved, By the Federation of Mission Im
provement Clubs, representing the whole of
the Mission district, that we respectfully re
quest the Board of Supervisors to Instruct the
District Attorney (Judpe D. J. .Murphy) to
immediately institute legal proceedings in the
name of the city and county of San Francisco
to abate the nuisance now being operated by
the Southern Pacific Railroad Of Kentucky;
also the rock crusher and quarry now Mine
operated by Gray Bros, at the corner of Doug
lass and Clipper streets, as both of these
nuisances are being operated without the sh;id
i'\v of legal right and are detrimental to the
best Interests of the residents Hnd taxpayers ot"
the Mission district.
Resolved, That our secretary prepare a peti
tion to tie presented at the next meeting of
the Board of Supervisors, and that a com
mittee of seven LÂ»- appointed to wait on the
District Attorney and the Board of Supervisors
and explain the wishes or the people of this
district, and be it further
Resolved, That we request the press of this
city to use Its jrreat Dower to assist us In
our efforts to recover the use of our streets
and the enjoyment of life, health and the
pursuit of happiness,
Following in the wake of this scorcher,
which was introduced by Captain Ander
son, Gustave Schnce. chairman of the ex
ecutive committee, introduced the follow
ing on the Geary street franchise, which
wenl through without a single vote in
opposition;
Resolved, That the Federation of Mission Im
provement Clubs Is of the opinion that It is
against public policy to grant a new franchise
on Geary street at this time, and believes that
the interest of the entire people will be best
subserved by allowing the present franchise to
expire before any action is taken by the Board
of Supervisors on this most Important question.
Resolved, further. That this federation com
mends his Honor Mayor Phelan and the press
for their assistance in defeating the- boodle
scheme of the railroad company and those Su
pervisors who Bought to barter away valuable
privileges belonging to the people without any
Just return.
Resolved, further. That we pledge our assist
ance to defeat the Geary-street frnnchlse Job
and would urge the people to take charge of
this road on the expiration of the franchise In
1903 and operate It in the Interest of the city.

Nemesis of bad luck which pursues some

diversity of opinion as to their retention,
it is certain thai we as a nation an> in

PAX FRANCISCO, June 1. 1599.
To the Honorable Board of Supervisorsâ
Gentlemen: We very much desire to bid on
the lumber that you require for the Fire
Department if we could tlo go Intelligently,
but the specifications are made out so in
definitely that no one can bid on them in
telligently .-in i know what he has to fur
nish. The first article calls for clear,
vertical train one-inch thick, from two
Inches wide to twenty inches wide and from
twelve to forty feet long Now a one-inch
by thfe-inoh twelve i>et long would be
worth probably $15 per 1000 feet, and a one.
inch by twenty-inch forty feet long would
be worth at least $35 per 1000 feet. In fact.
it would not be practicable to pet it at all.
and the same thing would ajply to othtr
items in the specifications. It makes a great
difference whether the lumber is narrow or
excessively wide or whether the lumber is
shr.rt or very long. Then â -â â -, call Tor
all clear, vertical grain lumber, when yon
use a lnree part of merchantable. Merchant
able lumber is worth from $7 to $!â â  per lO**)
feet less than dear, and you certainly would
not want to put clear and select stock into
ordinary work and pay from $: to $10 more
per IW>> feet for it,' yet 'your specifications
df-man<l it. Then in redwood the specifica
tions call for T. at G. from four feet to
twenty feet long. Now â¢me of the bidders
may know just what may be required, but
we i-nnnot tell from the specifications
whether we will have to fifrnish lumber
that is worth $15 per 1000 or whether we
will have to furr.leh lumber worth twice
that amount. Respectfully yours.

APPEAL OF A MOTHER.
Writes to the Mayor .Protesting
Against the Reopening of the
Coursing Park.
The proposition to repeal the .>â ;,-â ] i ing
ordinance which prevents th" selling of
pools on horse races and coursing matches
has called forth many protests, but none
mere affecting than the following:, which
was received by Mayor Phelan yesterday:
BAN FRANCISCO, June 1. 1859.
Hon. James D. Phelan â Your Excellency,
Sir: I take the liberty to peal to you
in regard to the repealing resolution of .
the coursing law. I am sure that you are
opposed to it, but no one that has never
vlfited the coursing park can realize what
tt is like. Coursing is far worse than the
horse races: men are admitted for 25 cents,
an enticement for young boys and men to
gamble. The ladies are admitted free,
which induces the poorer class o? people to
patronize them who oannot afford the horse
races. I live in sight of the coursing park
and witness all that occurs. The sight of
women taking their children into this pool
sflling place and into back entrances of
the saloons, and the language of these
Intoxicated mothers brings the blush to
my cheek, as I am a grandmother and
have brought up children in the right path.
J deem It my duty to pray to you to do ,
all in your power to prevent this -evil in '
this city. All the neighbors are In Fym
pathy with me. but are afraid of giving
voice for fear of making enemies of the
coursing people. Most respectfully.
A MOTHER.

SOUTHERNERS AND
COFFEE.
Cooking School Teacher From
the South.
My father was a Southerner, and
therefore we always had coffee three
times a day, and as a result are a very
nervous family.
I could not break off from the coffee
habit until I found a delightful bever-
age in the Postum Four] Coffee.
I have, learned to lik<; it better than
coffee.
We did not like it at first, because it
was nut made according to directions;
but since we have come to know that
it must be boiled we are enthusiastic
in its praise.
I give lessons in cooking and am nat-
urally brought in contact with a great
many people whose habits of food and
drink I learn. I find that many fami-
lies have come to know of the advan-
tages of Postum Food Coffee and have
abandoned common coffee altogether. I
could send you a long list of these if
you care for it.
I cannot epeak too highly in praise
if Postum. I have often wished I could
afford to buy a few dollars' worth and
pive it to those who are suffering from j
the drug contained in ordinary coffee
and who would be glad to know that j
they could have a delicious cup of
health coffee. Mrs. Myra J. Tuller, 302

TWO YOUNG GIRLS TIRE
OF THE PACE THAT KILLS
Mary Hottua and Blanche Dickey Drink to
Death in Chloroform â Only One Sur

a
PRI\CIP.ALS IN THE TRAGEDY AT THE ROY4L EAGLE.
TWO vounsr piris. jaded from the
pace that kills, attempted sui
cide tog-ether yesterday in the
d( sire for rest. One found it.
th<> other lives to tell the Btory
of th<Â» tragedy.
Mary Ellt n Hottua, known among
her pay companions as May Ward,
was the poor unfortunate whOÃe life
la ended. Blanche Dickey is the sur
vivor. Neither pirl had counted more
than 20 years of ape, but both had
lonp been familiar with the nifcht side
of life. Weariness of It all had pre
them for the deed, whi<-h was
undoubtedly Inspired by Mary Hottua.
through dread of the next step in both
careers propow '1 by her companion.
The double suieiri.> was deliberately
planned. Hours before they took the
poison with which they hoped to <>nd
their lives the uiris had made up their
minds to die together. They rehearsed
the. details of death Friday morning
and before 3 o'clock that afternoon
they had procured enough chloroform
to kill half a dozen people. They were
seen by any number of their aCQUaLnt
while they were going from
store to stor* in quest of the. drup.
They appealed to he in pooii spirits and
stopped more than once to tell friends
that they were K'.irit; away. They bade
several a cheery good-by, but refused
to divulge their destination. At four
different places they purchased as
many one-ounce bottles of chloroform,
under the pretext that they wished to
use it In cleaning gloves.
Krom resort to resort around the
town the two girls then proceeded.
takinp good-by drinks with more
friends, more than once laughing at
the baffled curiosity of those who in
quired concerning their stopping place.
They took dinner together about 6
o'clock in the evening and then took
another long walk in the district
where they hnd known so many gay
times. They drank considerably and,
when they called at the Royal Eagle
lodging-house, over the Pah-u Cafe,
P iwell and ElliS Streets, they werÂ»
distinctly under the influence of liquor.
It was 1 o'clock yesterday morning
when the girls were shown to room 61.
They had no poonor pot inside and
taken off their wraps than Mary Hot
tua sat flown to write farewell letters.
This occupied her almost an hour, dur
ing which time she and Blanche Dick
ey, according to the survivor, talked
Over the things that had happened and
the step they were about to take.
Having sealed her letters in black bor
dered envelopes and stamped them,
Mary Hottua took the elevator to the
street and mailed them at Powell and
Ellis streets. Upon her return she pro
ceeded to make ready the Last drink.
The chloroform in the bottles she
poured in equal portions into two
whisky glasses.
"Here's looking at you, Blanche,"
she said to her companion, raising the
plass to her lips.
Blanche Dickey took the other glass
and made a similar move.
"Now 1 ." said Mary Hottua, and suit-
Ing the action to the word, she tossed
off the poisim. Her companion tried
to do likewise and got some of the
liquid down her throat, when her
stomach rebelled and she was not only
unable to swallow more but what she
had taken came up. The chloroform
had puch a powerful effect on her,
however, that she reeled and fell on
the bed, barely conscious enough to
hf-ar'her companion scream and to see
her run for the door, which she threw
open.
The shrieks of Mary Hottua aroused
Several roomer? in -the house, who
found her leaning against the wall In
the hallway. With the help of the
colored porter they carried her back
Into room 61. where Blanche Dickey,
apparently dead, was still .stretched on
the bed.- the glass, yet half full of
chloroform, which she had returned to
the table, indicating the poison that
had been used.
â¢'My God, she's dead!" exclaimed

Miss Hottua. Then, before any one
knew what she was about, she reached
for the remaining glass of chloroform
and drained It at a gulp, dropping to
the floor before any person could roach
her.
Dr. C. A. Mueller was summoned
from his office and several of the
crowd that had gathered in the room
ran for the police. Officers Mulcahy
and Bylvester and Dr. Mueller arrived
almost simultaneously, Harry Thorn,
who had been telephoned for. coming
in just aÂ« Blanche Dickey began to
show signs of returning life. The phy
sician gave it as his opinion that her
life was in no Immediate danger, but
ordered that Mary Hottua be taken to
the Receiving Hospital, where it was
possible she might be saved.
The ambulance with the dying girl
reached the hospital at 2:80 o'clock,
and Dr. Tormey went to work to save
h< r lite. His efforts proved unavailing,
and she expired within an hour, never
having regained consciousness. Her
body waa taken to the Morgue. The
efforts to revive Blanche Dickey were
rewarded In a short time, and before
E o'clock she was none the worse for
h'-r experience than the possessor of
a bad headache. She left the room she
had entered to die a few hours before
and twice during the day she called at
the Morgue to weep over the body of
her dead friend.
Mary Hottua, while a frequent visitor
to the reports and a participator in the
revels that mark the tenderloin, was
i ...i an abandoned woman. Sly was
the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Nicko
laiis Hottua, with whom Bfce resided at
1:711: Hush street until last Tuesday.
That morning she. left home, and com
ing downtown she met several com
panions, with whom she proceeded on
a picnic to a suburban resort. On her
return to the city in the evening she
met Blanche Dickey, who had fre
quently been her companion around
town. She desired to get home at mid
night but forgot herself and remained
bo late that she resolved she would
make a night of It, which she did. A
year ago she had run away from home
and remained away some months.
When she returned, her father, who
is a wagon-maker at 715 Folsom street,
informed her that she could remain
if she would make it a rule never to
be out later than midnight any night.
The infraction of this rule Tuesday
night led to her doom.
Upon awakening in the morning
Mary Hottua confided to her frfend
that she could never go home again,
and the two began casting about for
some way out of their difficulty. Noth
ing presented, itself until later in thÂ«
day, when Blanche Dickey suggested
that they could go to Sacramento and
enter fully into the life upon the edge
of which they had been for so many
months. The, other demurred at this
and suggested that she had an offer
from a young commercial traveler to
go to Denver. She said she would see
him and if he would consent to take
herself and Blanche they both would
go. Blanche Dickey consented, and
the other girl went out to flnd the
man. She returned several hours later
with the information that she had
found him and that he had consented
to take both of them.
Thursday Mary Hottua, who had
been staying with Blanche Dickey, re
ceived a note from her male friend
that he would be unable to take the
contemplated trip for several months.
Tho girl became. de3pondent and spoke
to her chum of suicide. The latter
laughed at the idea and re
newed her suggestion that they
had better go to Sacramento.
Mlbs Hottua reluctantly consented that
evening, but when she awoke in the
morning she had changed her mind
and so told Miss Dickey. The ta,lk of
suicide was resumed and it was de
cided by both that, rather than take
the downward step contemplated,

death was preferable. They acted on
this decision, and r.ow Mary Hottua

she had desired to lie by the side of
her erring slÃter.
The father <>t Mary Hottua was notl
fli <\ during the morning of the suicide
of his daughter and called at the
morgue. He did not seem to be sur
prised at the fate (hat had overtaken
her. and left a few minutes after he
had called to consult with the mother
of the dead eirl as to what disposition
would be made ol the remains. Late
yesterday afternoon the father or
flered the unfortunate girl's body re
moved to the California Undertaking
Parlors.
Blanche Diekoy, who claims to have
come here from Portland. Or. . win-re
Bhe claims her parents reside, was
glad lasi night she was alive, although
sorrowing deeply for her <1< :nl chum.
"May and I were both tired of life,"
she said. "I knew her from the time
when we were little girls together, and
when I met. her on Market street the
other day we grew confidential. I had
been blue and sick of the life I was
leading for some time, and I told her
all my troubles. She was not in the
best of spirits. Things were not going
right at home. She had no love affairs
to bother her. She simply wanted to
get away from the city and her home.
"Well, we stayed downtown together
that night, and May, of course, could
not go home the next clay, as her
father had told her if she ever stayed
away from home over night s.he need
not come back. Thursday we decided
to leave the city, and a young man,
whose name I will not give, promised
to take us to Denver. Of course we
were both delighted, and we went
about town bidding all our friends
good -by.
"After we had made all preparations
to go to Denver and had hidden all
our friends good-by the young man
who promised to take us sent a note
stating that he could not go. This
broke us all up. and May suggested
that we commit suicide. I foolishly
consented to do so, and we visited
four different drugstores and pur
chased an ounce. of chloroform in each
place. We could not buy four ounces
at one place, but an one, ounce was
hardly enough to kill anybody
the drug clerks sold it to us.
"AH day Friday we had suicide in
mind, and both myself and May
talked about the other world and spec
ulated on what was In store for us
thÂ»Â»re. We had several dollars, bo wo
went to the Royal Ea^le and hired a
room. May sat down and wrote for an
hour. She wrote letters to at least
forty friends, bidding them good-by,
and sealed each one in a black-bor
dered envelope. Thpn she went out
and posted the letters at the corner.
"When she came back we bade each
other good-by and drank the poison.
May <lrank two ounces at one gulp. I
rained the glass to my lips and drank
some of it. The rest refused to go
down. I really tried hard to gulp the
horrid stuff, but my stomach rebelled.
In the meantime May had opened the
door and ran screaming Into the hall.
Several of the roomers in the house
heard her cries and they c.ime rush
inp in. Then I became pnrtly uncon
scious. While they were working over
me May reached over and drank the
remainder of the chloroform in the
bottle which I only partially emptied.
"I am glad I did not end my life.
When I went down to the Morgue and
was ushered into that ill-smelling
hole where poor little May lay on a
cold, stone slab it all came back to
me. Tht-re the element of the serfous
n. ss of it all dawned upon me, and as
I looked on her features cold in death
I thought of the world that I would
give were the stern realities of the
night previous but idle creations of
fancy."

9 Dear Sir: It is proposed to give to every man who volunteered in California for

58 been appointed to call upon the citizens of Pan Francisco and we bespeak for them a
â¦ favorable reception. We make no apology for asking your co-operation. Our citizens
2? should be honored by the opportunity afforded them to decorate the brave you men
â¦ who at the call of country, went to the front, ready to sacrifice" their lives. For
88 all their privations and hardships we will confer upon them a medal, of no Intrinsic
â¦ value, but which, coming (;om the" people, will be a distinction which they will
iS appreciate, and to which, tney are so well entitled. It will speak for the gratitude
4 of California, and inspire others to follow their example, thus worthily recognized,
Â£â¢ when our country is In peril.
a" They were enthusiastically sent on their Journey; now. with equal enthusiasm, let
<Â£ us welcome the survivors home. You need not wait the call of the committee if you
A are prompted to send a contribution. Respectfully,
cÂ» FRANK B. RYAN, Secretary. JAMES D. PHELAN, Chairman.

OAKLAND TAKES
A SLOW GAME
FROM SAN JOSE
Almost a Riot On the
the Diamond.
DO W OVAN CAUSES TROUBLE
TRIES TO BLOCK HANLON AND IS
CALLED TO ACCOUNT.
Prune-j. lckers Have a Hard Time of
It All Around and Narrowly
Escape a Shut-
Out.
Nine Oaklanders and the umpire, to
r w itli tluir own bungles, sent the
wn to defeat a( Been a
li'in Park yesterday afternoon by o score
to l.
Aside from some rough work on the
if Donovan, that came near break-
Ing up the game in a free-for-all light,
w< r< few thrilling episodes during
the afternoon. The prune-pickers were
badly handicapped even before the game
commenced. During the Memorial day
ween the same teams. Ham
mond of Oakland ran into Hanlon, cut
ting the big first baseman's leg so badly
that he could hardly hobble around. An
other draft was made on Santa Clara Col
ud Kelly was secured for the pres
eries. He was to play right, with
Graham at first Kelly had never played
â  grounds before and consequently
was unable to make allowance for the
wind sheering the ball off to one side, so
misjudging two easy Hies he was
m finished the game.
Kelly distinguished himself, however,
EPISODES OF THE GAME.
by scoring the only run for his side. In
the second Inning, with two men out, he
caught the ball fairly on his bat and
lifted it over the right field fence for a
home run. It was no reflection on the
young man to be called in where he was;
it -was merely owing to his unfamiliarity
â¢with the ground and the high winds.
Leake, the colt shortstop for the Gar
deners, was afflicted with stage fright in
the early part of the game, making two
costly errors in the third inning. After
that he steadied down and played a bril
liant fielding game, though he- was un
able to hit safely. He covers almost as
much territory as Schmeer, is a strong,
accurate thrower, a good runner and
handles himself in a most" creditable man
ner, Once he pulled down a fly away back
of third that ought to have gone to Dal
rymple by rights.
Graham is another good man, and when
the members of the team become a little
more familiar with each other they will
make the leaders hustle.
O'Connell was awful in his decisions,
He seemed unable to Bee any ball that
either Andrews or Borehers put over the
plate unless the batter actually swung
his blirtigeon, while some of his
decisions at the bases were fright
ful. Once Hammond came from
second almost across the pitcher's
box to the plate, â  leaving third
bast far to the Bide, but the run was al
lowed. O'Connell said he had forgotten
about the runner on second and was
â watching the ball. Another time Donovan
was on secondhand started to steal third.
Kent threw to ODea, who held the ball
and had Donovan easily. The Oaklander,
however, ran full speed into ODea,
knocking him down and sending the nail
out into the Id. Donovan kept on home
and O'Conneli allowed the run, which ne
cessitated charging ODea with an error
in the score.
Again, in the eigth inning McGucken
singled. Leake smashed the ball to Mcs
kiman, who threw to Schmeer to head
Unhappy off. Schmeer got the ball,
but he was not near second base, and
â without touching the bag at all threw to
first and Oakland was credited with a
double play.
It was in Oaklands 1 half of that inning
that a riot almost broke loose. Donovan
was on first when Borchers snapped tne
ball over and caught him off the bag.
Donovan started for ' second / and was
chased up and down the line by Ander
son and Hanlon. Donovan worked back
toward first, and just as Anderson threw
the ball the Oaklander made a dash at
Hanlon, throwing his forearm across hrs
face with such force that Hanlon was
half blinded for the instant, although he
managed to hold the ball and put Dono
van out. Borchers, white with, rage,
walked over to Donovan and would have
put him out of business had Donovan not
discreetly dropped back. .Lange seized
a bat and led the other eight Oaklandcrs
to the rescue, while the prune-pickers
rallied to Borchers' support in double
quick. For a time it looked like a general
mix-up, but O'Connell finally managed to
restore order. Lange was hooted by the
crowd for arming himself with a bat and
became involved in a dispute with an oc
cupant of the grandstand^ during which
some language never learned in Sunday
school was indulged in.
Oakland played an errorless game,
Bchmeer's work at short being the great
est exhibition even that star has given
yet. Moskiman kept the seven hits made
off his delivery well scattered, and had
Kelley'B shot been anything less than a
homer San Jose would have been shut
out. Score:

CYCLERS DISCUSS THE
RECENT RELAY RACE
VIGOROUS PROTEST OF ACME
WHEELMEN OF OAKLAND.
The Much Discussed Local Rider
Clause of the Associated Clubs
Is Again Upheld.
The board of governors of the Califor
nia Associated Cycling Clubs met last
night in the rooms of the Cycle Board of
Trade. Parrott building. The old Bght
over the "local rider" clause in the con
stitution was renewed. The previous ac
tion of the board was upheld.
In effect this, is that racing men can
only represent a club from the city and
county in which they live. This is to pre
vent the large clubs from gathering all
the fast riders throughout the State and
using the pick of them in Interclub con
tests. The vote was twelve t.. ten in fa
vor "f the old order, those in favor being
the delegates from Capital City Wheel
men, Sacramento; Garden City Wheel
men, San Jose; Olympic club wheelmen,
San Francisco, and Stanley (J. Scovern
and Professor J. J. B. Argenti, repre
senting the unattached. Opposed to them
were the Acme Wheelmen. Oakland; En
cinal Wheelmen, Alameda; Hay City
Wheelmen, San Francisco, and Paul N.
Nipper) of the unattached.
Tlie protest of the Acme Wheelmen
against their competitors in the recent
one hundred mile relay race was pr< -
sen ted Informally, ft consists of three
counts: That the Garden City Wheelmen
started without a packet;- that they ap
propriated the Acme packet within the
first ten miles, and that there was indis
criminate pacing throughout The board !
of governors will meet again on the 14th
inst. to hear the report of the racing
board as to its findings in the premises.
I^eon f'arru and Professor J. J. H. Ar
genti. of the touring committee, reported
that they were at work outlining some
tours to interesting points of the State.
The question of changing the member
ship of the organization from clubs to in
dividuals, as proposed by T. A. Woodson
of Sacramento, was not discussed. A
committee to which the matter was re
ferred for investigation was not ready
to report. The delegates present were:
President Paul M. Nippert, Secretary
Stanley G. Scovern. T. D. Whitman, W.

that from the time ne left New York un

started the topsail halyards. The last
time he was herp in the Iroquoia, he had a
similar experience, so that for two con-
Fecutive voyages around the Horn Captain
Taylor has not experienced weather that
would cause him to take a topgallant

executed on the Kenllworth during the,
voyage that should prove an object les

NO TRACE OF
THE ALAMEDA'S
MISSING GOLD
The Detectives Are
Nonplused.
CANNOT SOLVE THE MYSTERY
THINK THE SOVEREIGNS WERE
STOLEN AT SYDNEY.
A Cabin Boy Who Was Sent Into the
Specie Tank Soon After Sailing
Says There Were Only
29 Boxes.
The excitement over the loss of the box
containing i*â¢ lo sovereigns has not abated
one whit aboard the mail steamer Ala
meda. or on Pacific street wharf. An
extra searching force of Custom-house of
ficers were at work all day and every
nook nnd cranny on the big liner is being
limbed. So far not a trace of the miss
ing money has been found and the man
ner of its disappearance Is still as much
a matter of conjecture as ever. Purser
Thomas Smith Is confident that the mnnpv
went into the Bpecie tank. Others again
think that it was juggled Into the little
alley that runs bark Into the steerage
and so on deck, Instead of into the steer
age dining-room ami thence into the
vault.
Purser Smi'h says: "The poid camp
down to the ship in three trips, each
wagonload consisting of ten boxes. When
the wagon arrived I went on the duck
and counted the boxes in the presenci ol
! the bank clerks. Each box is marked and
numbered, and the. clerks gave me the
' numbers on \\'jÂ± boxes. I wrote them
, down in my book and we then Btarted to
place the gold on board. I stood just
Inside the hatchway, and Third Officer A.
M. Smith stood by my side. As the steve
dores came up the pans plank and passed
; me 1 stopped them, took the number on
the box and drew a circle around the
Bame figure on my book.
"From where I stood to the door of the
steerage dining-room is ten feet; and the
men passed into the room, where chief
Officer Rennle stood beside the open trap
door leading to the vault/ In the vault
Second Officer Mekkleson was stationed
to tally the boxes. I. am sure thirty
boxes passed by me, and [ receipted for
them. I did not see the boxes again until
May 29, when 1 went into the vault to
k<-i sonic supplies of wine. I counted the
specie boxes and found but twenty-nine
there."
The remaining twenty-nine boxes were
removed yesterday to the Parts and j
American Bank. Captain Howard, super
intendent of the Oceanic Steamship Com-
I pany, and Detectives Gibson, Eigan and
Sllvey then made a thorough examina
tion of the Bpecie tank. l>ut nothing that
could throw any li^ht <>ti the mystery
was discovered. Among the police offi
cers the opinion seems to be that the
box of sovereigns never left Sydney.
Their convictions are strengthened by the
story which H. Cook, one of the cabin
boys, tells. He Bays that when the Ala
meda was three flays out from Sydney,
N. S. w.. he and some others were sent
into the Bpecie tank to get out a quan
tity of wines and liquors. While the
other boys were at work he walked hack
and forth over the boxes of sovereigns,
thinking how few people in the world had
trod gold under foot as he. As he walked
he counted the boxes and says positively
there were only twenty-nine. He is sure
of that, because he figured out how much
twenty-nine boxes, each containing ."â nun.
sovereigns would make in American !
money. At that time ne did not know
there should have been thirty boxes and
the matter passed out of his mind until
the discovery of the loss was made by
I'm.-, purser.
An almost Identical robbery was com- i
mitted '.iii the Peninsular and Oriental
Steamship Company's Oceana In Sydney;
harbor not very long ago< A shipment
of gold was being made to England and
on f the boxes disappeared. The most
diligent search failed to discover any i

LOS ANGELES WINS
ITS WATER CASE
THE RIVER MAY BE DIVERTED
TO SUPPLY THE CITY.
No Extra Damages in the Condemna
tion Can Be Enforced for Sup
posed Subterranean
Streams.
A decision favorable to t ho city of Loa j
Angeles In its action against A. E. Pom- ]
eroy. Hooper et al., was handed down :
yesterday by the Supreme Court in bank, j
The case lias been fought through the
courts for the past three or four years,
and in the last two years it lias haÂ«l two
hearings in the higher tribunal. Jt was
a contest ut the riparian owners of the
water of the L<>s Angeles River or creek
and the needs of a great city. In orier
to secure a sufficient water supply for
the Inhabitants of the city it was neces
sary to obtain possession and control of
the headwaters of the stream. HÂ«re the
contest began, for a' number of property
owners living along the stream resisted
th( efforts to divert the water from Its
natural course Into flumes, etc., contend
ing that their riparian rights superseded
any rights set up by the inhabitants of
the city. The latter had but one recourse,
and that was to the courts in condemna
tion proceedings, and some of the best
legal talent in the southern part of tho
State was engaged in the case.
Many intricate and puzzling questions
of law and equity were involved In the
litigation, and even the Justices of the
Supreme Court were unable to ail agree
on the issues presented. For instance,
the old city of Los Angeles covered four
leagues of land, and under the old law
by which its inhabitants obtained their
water the supply that could be drawn
from the stream was limited to the pe< -
pie living within the four leagues. Now
that the city extends over a much great* r
territory the proposition was put forth
by the riparian owners that no more
water could " be taken from the stream
than was necessary to supplj those liv
ing within the original four-league limit.
The Supreme Court decided that the city
has a right to water for its entire popu
lation.
The same line of argument was set up
with reference to the water for the main's,
artificial lakes and pleasure resorts, ana
again the Supreme Court decided in favor
of the city. Another point also related
to the stream. It was known thru there
Is what may be called :â¢. double flow of
water, that of the surface over the bi i
of the river, and another, a subterranean
stream below the bed of the river. Are
thry on'- and the same streams, or shoi ! 1
they !"â¢ considered as separate? The
lower court held that it is all one stream,
which appears and flows and disappears,
but still (lows, according to the nature ..f
the ground along Its course. This cut no
i small figure In determining the amount
of damages in the condemnation proceed
ings. The city would pay the value of the
land, but the owners demanded more.
Their contention was that the land pos
sessed a greater value than what ap
peared upon the surface, namely, the
subterranean stream which flowed there
under, and they were entitled to extra
damages. This was fine point on which
the upper court was divided, but the ma
jority decided to uphold the lower court
against the contention.
Th< property involved is estimated at
from $30,000 to J40.000. The decision up
holds the decision of the lower court, hut
had the opinion written by Chief Justice
Beatty prevailed the <ii\- would have lost,
for he disagree^ with the majority upon
the four-league proposition.
MEANS CITY OWNERSHIP.
LOS ANGEL.ES, June 3.â The effect <>f
the decision given out to-day in the Su

best he has h.ard for n long time, and
that municipal ownership or the water

HID HIMSELF AWAY
FROM SIGHT OF MAN
Death Draws Near a Former Contra
Costa Official Who Became a Her-
rait Thirty Years Ago.
SAN RAFAEL, June 3.â ln a little ram
shackle cabin on which fhe boards and
shingles rattle in the wind, a place where
the breezes seem to whisper of ghosts
and fairy lore as they sweep down the
Nicasio Canyon, lies an old man whose
head has been whitened by the frosts of
more than seventy winters. Henry Hazen
Abbott's candle of life is about snuffed
out and with his demise will be written
the concluding page of a tale that in cer
tain ways is as wonderful as anything
ever penned by a Verne or a Stevenson.
Thirty years ago Abbott, who was then
Deputy County Recorder of Contra Costa
County, became involved in a broil with a
maji named Gilbert over the latter's wife,
and in order to save his life fled, with
bullets singing a merry tune of vengeance
about his ears. A week later a body was
washed upon the banks of the Sacra
mento River and identified as that of
Abbott. Thousands of dollars worth of
property belonging to him finally went
to the State.
For over thirty years nothing further
was heard of the man and nobody ques
tioned the report of his death, but a few
months ago he was met by an acquaint
ance while chopping wood on Paper Mill
Creek, where he lived in a hollow tree.
Abbott said he had concluded to bury
himself alive in the redwoods and cared
nothing for the loss of his property. Up
seemed eager to hear of his old friends
and laughed heartily at tie opinion pre
vailing regarding his death.
Now he lies ill and the story of his
peculiar life is about ended.

WITH THE FEVER
Texas Shuts Out Mail From New Or
leans That Has Not Been
Fumigated.
AUSTIN, Tex., June 3.â The United
States postal authorities and the State
Health Department of Texas are at log
gerheads over the fumigation of mail
originating or passing through the Now
Orleans postoffice and destined for Texas.
State Health Officer Blunt established a
quarantine against New Orleans on May
29 on account of a yellow fever case there
and has permitted no mail to enter Texas
from that city since that date. The
Marine Hospital service surgeons have re
ported to the Postoffice Department at
Washington that there is no yellow fever
in New Orleans, and that fumigation of
the mails is unnecessary, and up to this
time Dr. Blunts requests for fumigation
were not respected. Jn the meantime no
mail from New Orleans has been allowtd
to enter Texas, and business interests are
suffering greatly on account of the ex
clusion. Dr. Blunt stated to-day that he
would stand firm and that he will con
tinue to shut out all New Orleans mail
unless it has first been fumigated.
Governor Sayers wired Surgeon General
Walter Wyman of the Marine Hospital
service at Washington, D. C. as follows
to-day:
"Please see Postmaster General and get
him to order mail from New Orleans to
Texas fumigated. If no other case of yel
low fever occurs in New Orleans wiliun
the next six days, quarantine regulations
will be relaxed. Private but reliable in
formation leads us to doubt the accuracy
of official reports as to yellow fever
situation.
â¢'JOSEPH D. SAVERS, Governor."

NEW HAVEN, Conn., June 3.â Yale signally

WITH THE CORSET
nAKIaAND, June 3.â Dr. Rowe, at the Receiving Hospital, was startled out
of his usual placidity to-night by a discovery that came near upsetting
his theories of sex. For a few minutes, the popular surgeon was in doubt
as to whether a patient he was treating was man or woman, or
whether the patient was masculine In feminine undergarments, or a woman
in masculine outergarments. The subject was registered at the Receiving
Hospital as "John Fox," laborer, aged 66 years; left hip broken in runaway."
It appears that Fox was driving one of Lund's delivery wagons to-night,
when the horse became fractious and threw him from the vehicle. He was
promptly carried to the Receiving Hospital, where after his outer garments
had been removed Dr. Rowe was horrified to find that beneath a flannel shirt
the aged man wore a woman's corsets and the usual feminine paraphernalia
even to the minutest details.

It Is expectad Connemara, Lowlander
and Luxor will be the principal contend
ers as the final round of the stake is ap
proached. They are all in splendid con
dition, being fast and strong.
The preliminary round of the open stake
yesterday was pronounced hard to pick
by the bettors, but the favorites won with
but few exceptions. The upsets were
generally severe ones. Prince. Hal, a -6 to
1 favorite, was beaten by Ida. Lowe and
Thompson's big dog had the speed, but
could not turn quickly enough in the
twisting course he had to run. Koolawn,
another 5 to 1 shot, lost to F. Moran's
Snapshot. Pretender was made a 2 to 1
favorite over Belle Clan. They had a
short four.se and were ordered back to the
slips by Judge Bell. The Belle had
shown such speed that she was Installed
a warm favorite, justifying the confi
dence placed in her by winning handily.
Van Knapp proved a disappointment
in the extra stakes. He met Baby King
in the preliminary round and was made
a 2 to 1 favorite. After scoring five
points he wont to pieces and after that
was not in the running. The last of the
big upsets of form was the defeat of
Lottie M by Benicia Boy. She was 5 to
1 in the betting.
In two of the courses it was found
necessary to release extra dogs to kill
the hates and thus prevent injury to the
other dogs. The hare ran two minutes
and twenty-five seconds in the course be
tween Mountain Beauty and Las Palmas,
while it required two minutes and fifty
seven seconds to kill in the course be
tween Commodore and Beau Peep.
The course between Statesman and
Dempsey Lass aroused the interest of the
spectators, as it seemed for a time that
Dempsey Lass, the shortender. would get
the ting. The favorite. Statesman, finally
won. The detailed result of the sport fol-

Commission Merchants Claim the
Corporation Refuses to Deliver
Goods Promptly.
The commission merchants in the
wholesale district are protesting loudly
against the methods of Wells. Fargo &
Co., the corporation which refused to pay
its share of the war tax. The trouble
this time is not over any war tax how
ever, but another little scheme which the
heads of the corporation have hatched
out to help fill their coffers. Just at th.s
time of the year large quantities of pei
ishable goods are being shipped into the
city by farmers through ells, Faigo &
C These goods should all delivered at
or about 5:30 in the. morning, but it is
alleged by the commission men that the
ml waeons of the express company ha\ c
r been W dS S ing the consignments , in ron
of the stores at any time from 1 to v
a. m., or long after the heaviest tooying
of the day has been done. Many lf
merchants have for some time past b. en

goods which Wells. Fargo & Co. have
been paid to deliver, and the offl< â¢

OAKLAND, June 3.â The heirs made
devisees under the will of the late Mar
garet Williams, through their attorney,
W. H. Payson. to-day filed exceptions to
the final account of the executor, Erin
Williams. "The account," they allege,
"does not show the receipts and income of
the property nor the expenditures. The
account charges all of the expenses of
administration against the principal of
the estate and apportions no part of said
expenses as against the income of said
estate, whereas the expenses of adminis
tration should be charged against the in
come of the estate while the same is in
the executor's hands." The balance on
hand as stated in the final account the
objectors regard as incorrect.

Although the confession, assuming it to
be true, is practically useless, Mrs. Wag
ner's mind is almost unhinged over the
suspense, and she declares that she would
die contented if she knew the truth.
The confession said to have been made
by Showers was the suit of Abe Majors'
going to Folsom for the burglaries com
mitted in Oakland. From the time of the
lad's arrival he was made .acquainted
with the fact that Showers was the man
who had sent his father to the g.illows
Abe saw Showers twice a day, and each
time his hatred of the man naturally in
creased. George Putnam, a convict with a
hard reputation, heard Abe's story and it
is said swore that he would have venge
ance on Showers in I . half of the young
convict. March 15 Abe Majors was on
trial in Box Elder County, Utah, for the

was killed at this spot, and The Call reiterated its evidence of the violation
of the' law by the Southern Pacific.
This has now had its effect, and General Manager Kruttfcehnitt will have
a system of safety gates erected at this highly dangerous curve, in an in
view Mr Kiuttschnitt said:
"There is an optional feature to the franchise, and the company decided
that it would take advantage of the option and keep the approach clear
within the distance specified. If this haa not been done I am ignorant of
ii what way it hai been violated, r have discussed the matter with Di
vision Engineer Curtis, and he has told me that he does not believe the
lumber piles there obstruct the view, ar.d if there bo a flagman's house it is
o small to be much of an obstruction. However, the company is now
. id* to 'tut in a safety BVsWm., and th<- apparatus, including the gates, has

Majors was arrested, had a preliminary
examination, was tried In the Superior
Crurt, sentenced to death and chose to
be shot. His mother declares it to be im
pcSÃible that hr should have had a fair
trial and have taken advantage of all his

assured his mother of his innocence, and
Mrs. Wapner firmly believes him.
The unhappy woman was stricken down
with partial paralysis when she received
the news of th- death of one son and the
arrest of the other, and she is still in a
very precarious condition. To add to her
life of agony, she fs not able to procure
one cent with which to take a trip to
Box Elder County |ai] to see her boy
before he forfeits his life. Her friends are
almost as poor as herself and cannot
raise sufficient money to buy a ticket to
Utah. This last sorrow, the fear that
her boy may pass away without her being
ajjle to embrace him once more., is daily
crushing the life out of hrr. She has con

that if she cmilii know the truth one way

her earthly career should then close.

Sheriff H. 11. Cordon of Box Elder County
Bays that "Majors' behaviour is excellent,

Referring to the manner in which sen

Sheriff Cordon said: "Our statutes do
not define any mode of procedure regard

condemned to death. It has been custom
ary to use from four to six pruns. nne of

case the only plan laid out is the custom
of the past. I have not made any de

Mayor Snow was very much amused

J that he would act as Chief of Police, es

Works, stated to-day that he will leave
Monday morning for his farm in Sutter
County. He declares he is not trying to
avoid the question of police changes, Lut
i Intends to take his family away for some

The Mayor says: "My attention has

conveyed the impression that the Mayor
had induced Chief Fletcher to ask to be

BIGAMY CHARGES
MAY BE DROPPED
MRS. MINNIE AMES NOW SUES
FOB, DIVOKCE.
Alameda's Vanished Library Trustee
Will Make No Contest and the
Criminal Charges Will
Not Be Pressed.
Oakland Office San Francisâ¢ Call
WR Broadway, June 3.
Oeorj?e Spencer Ames, former Alameda
Library Trustee, who suddenly disap
peared one day last September and who
is wanted on clfargea of bigamy, was to
day made defendant in a divorce suit
filed by Mrs. Minnie A. Ames, his second
wift , who resides in Alameda.
It is currently rumored that since Ames'
first wife recently secured a decree of di
vorce a compromise had been effected
with Mrs. Ames No. 2 whereby the latter
will also be allowed to secure a decree
uncontested, and that then Mr. Ames will
be given an opportunity to start life anew
with his third wife, formerly Tessle Skel
ly, whom he married in Santa Rosa. In
the divorce complaint filed to-day Mrs.
Ames sues on the ground of infideiity and
failure to provide, and no stress is
laid upon the iact of bigamy, this proba
bly being part of the consideration in the
supposed compromise. The complaint
was prepared and filed this afternoon by
Senator E. K. Taylor.
The disappearance of ex-Library Trus
tee Ames last September created a de
cided sensation and preceded only a few
days the discovery of his bigamous ca
reer. Ames was also formerly chief en
gineer at the Alameda Electric Railway's
plant. His whereabouts is â¢ still un
known, though it is supposed that he is
in hiding in San Francisco or has gone to
Manila. Wealthy friends are said to
have been at work for a long time past
In efforts to effect a compromise with
Mrs. Ames No. 2, whereby she should t>
allowed to secure a divorce and at the
same time drop all further prosecution of
the bigamy charges. This, it is believed,
has been accomplished.
Li la Gertrude Brearty also filed suit for
a divorce from Francis W. Brearty tor
day. alleging failure to provide, and pro
ceedings were also commenced this after
noon by Adele Thomas for a legal sepa
ration from N. Thomas on the grounds
of desertion and neplect. The Thomases
also reside in Atemeda.
MRS. STORM FOUND GUILTY.
She Bravely Admits Having Thrashed
Alameda's Poundman.
ALAMEDA, June 3.â Mrs. Delia Storm,
| the little woman who whipped Poundmus
| ter Ewing when he undertook to impound
her cow, was found guilty of battery to
day by a jury in Justice Morris' court.
She was recommended to the extreme
mercy of the court, and the Judge fined
i her $1. The defendant was not at rII !
; backward in telling how she had knocked i
the poundmaster's front teeth out of
place.
"I did slap his face. Judge: I can't lie
about it." she said; "and I would do it
again if he attempted to take my. c<>-?c j
1 am a widow, but I feel able to take
care of myself. T am sure Mr. Ewlng will
admit that. I was peeling; potatoes for :
dinner When he took t-he cow, and I .iust
dropped the pan and went after him. <
Blood began to flow from his mouth and
nose after the second slap, but I did not '
think that a little hand like mine would
hurt such a big man as the poundman."
The jury was out three hours before it
reached a verdict.

EVIDENCE OF
MURDER FOUND
IN A CELLAR
Grewsome Relics of
an Old Crime.
A CLEW TO A MYSTERY
BLOODSTAINED HAT AND A
DENTED SKULL UNEARTHED.
Discovery That Is Thought to Ex
plain the Sudden Disappear
ance of an Aged Mexican
Half-Breed.
ALAMEDA. June 3.â Workmen who
were engaged yesterday demolishing the
old Bisset House, corner of Encinal ave
nue and Grove street, brought to light the
grewsome evidence of a crimp committed I
so long ago that but a faint iflea of its ,
nature and but a meager clew t"
identity of the victim are possible. That
murder was done and the unforn:
dragged beneath the house and uuriel j
there can be but little doubt.
Yesterday afternoon, while the men
were removing the flooring from the first
story of the annex an end of one of th,
bu;iri!s caught on some projection in the
dark space between the joists and the
ground. An Investigation disclosed an
old felt Mi xican sombrero, on one side of
which was a hole apparently nrnn.
si>n;<- dull instrument. Around the hole
was a dark discoloration not unlike h.i
man blood. The basement where the flnd
was made was Inaccessible, and it bad
never been thought that any human ha !
been in the place since the building was
erected away back in 18S3.
The finding <1f the hat and its suspicious
marks puzzled the workmen. They fas
tened to rip up the flooring, and when day
light was let into the chamber there was
found near the chimney of the annex a
mound resembling a grave, at the head
of which was a small cross roughly hewn
from two pieces of redwood. It was i n
top of the mound that the old sombrero
had. rested. There were unnl^taktbl? evi
dences of a tunnel leading uVier the side
wall of the annex, through v*hieh a nan
| might have gained entrance mto the cel
lar from the outside, but the opening of ;
which had been carefully closed and en
tirely obliterated by the changes of time.
Fritz Boehmer Jr. excavated around the !
mound, but unearthed nothing but a few
pieces of decayed planks. Still suspicious
that the cellar held a secret, he dug
around in other sections and unco
a short-handled spade of rather ancient j
pattern. It was buried about half a foot i
beneath the surface. The shortness of
the handle indicated that it was the in
strument used by the party who had been !
working beneath the floor of the old house
where there was barely a clear space of j
two feet. The end of the spade handle i
rested near the head of the mound, while I
! the blade pointed in the direction of an
i unexplored section of the cellar.
Acting on the theory that It was the
! secret mark indicating the location of \
â  some hidden treasure, young Boehmer
began to excavate in the direction to
which the old space pointed. He had
worked but a short time when at a dis
tance of three feet beneath the surface
! he turned up a human skull and the bones
i of an arm.
On one side of the skull was a ragged
I hole corresponding with the position of
the rent in the blood-stained sombrero, j
j The condition of the bones and the shovel j
I woulfl indicate that they had been under
I ground for a great number of years.
Many theories are advanced to account
I for the mysterious manner in which the
j grewsome relict found their way into the
j almost inaccessible basement. Old resi
; dents who live. in the vicinity of the Fisset
House tell queer stories of the sudden dis
appearance years ago of a mysterious
Mexican. Those who believe in spirits
tell in all seriousness of ghostly noises
about the old building and about the
statement of a spiritualist who asserted
that the basement of the structure was
'â â  studded with dead men's bones.
| The story of the old Mexican is given
. most credence, ami is borne out by ihe
I statements of Mrs. W. H. Waltz of 2846
; Van Buren street, who has lived near the
building almost since the time it was
erected, back in is.">::.
It was first occupied as a seminary for
young ladles, and was conducted by Dr.
Deal, a Methodist minister. The semi
nary proved a failure after an existence
of. three years, and the building became
j vacant. Early in the sixties an old half
breed Mexican made it his headquarters.
He was a surly old lellow. threacherous
! and quarrelsome, and was feared by the
f f w people who then li\ed on the Encinal.
! He was reputed to i ossess considerable
W< ulth.
A few days before ho disappeared he
i was visited by a Spaniard, who came from
San Francisco. Th" fellow hung about
the place, but did ''verything possible to
avoid attracting attention. One night the
sound of loud voices was hoard emanating:
from the old seminary. There was the
{ roise of a scuffle, a suppressed groan and
I all was still. None ol the old residents
remember having seen the old Mexican
after that night.
The following day Mrs. Waltz, then a
girl of fourteen, had an experience that
made an indelible impression upon her
mind and enables her -at this time to
i t!l vividiy the occurrences of so long
; ago.
She was being visited by a girl friend
i who had been a student at the seminary.
1 Desiring to take a look at the room she
bad occupied in the school, she requested
Mrs. Waltz to accompany her through
the woods to the building.
The girls found the door open and werÂ»
about to enter when they were hailed by
the Spaniard, who was running toward
them threatening their lives if they en
ten l the bull din^r.
"We were nearly scared to death," said
Mrs. Waltz in relating the story to a re-
Porter, "and, running through the door
way, we closed the door and bolted it
b.-forp the Spaniard reached us. He tried
to get in one of the windows, but we
fastened it also. We noticed that he was
much agitated and as pale as a ghost.
"Finally we made a noise in the rear
of the house as though we were going
out through the kitchen, and when hft
ran around to stop ns we hastened back
to the front door and made our escaue.
He chased us through the woods lor
<iuite v distance, but finally gave up and
returned to the seminary.
"I have never seen him since. I al
ways believed he was bent on mischief,
and' the finding of the bones and hat un
der the seminary floor convinces me that
he murdered the old Mexican and hid his
body where the bones were found."

MAYOR PHELAN WILL NOT CALL
THE SUPERVISORS TOGETHER
MAYOR PHELAN conferred with Supervisors Byington, Deasy,
Perrault, Lackmann and Heyer yesterday In his office. It was
the unanimous sentiment that the public business did not re
quire a meeting of the Board of Supervisors to-morrow, and
the Mayor derided not to call one. The adjournment of the
board last week without fixing a day on which to meet leaves the mat
ter in the hands of the Mayor under the consolidation act, which pro
vides for only four meetings a year, the next one being Monday,
July 3.
i they were not only not consulted in the I
matter but were ignored absolutely.
There has been ho secret about the I
fight for the Health Hoard appointments
that was being made by OrimmtoÃ and
Kelly. They brought every possible in
fluence to bea* on the Governor, even in
cluding Sam Uainey, who churned the
right to be heard because he had exerted
his influence among the Democrats of nan
Francisco to aid in the election of Gage.
T!u Governor listened attentively to the
arguments, but when it came to making
the appointments it appears that he chose
to repudiate ihe Crimmlns and Kelly out
tit and any promises he may have made
!,. them and accept the advice and dicta
tion of Bums and the railroad. This is
i not the lirst time Orimmlns and Kelly
' have been ignored by the Governor and
the Mexican, but it is the most bitter dose
' they have been compelled to swallow, and
hence they determined to be rev.nged.
The fact that a number of the mem
bers of the Hoard of Supervisors are prac
: tlcally controlled by Kelly and Crimmina
will furnish them the means to retaliate
with effect on the Governor and those
who are figuring on feeding on the politi
cal pap to be distributed by the Hoard of
Health. Aside from the statutory ap
pointments, which are comparatively lew
in number and importance, the plaei B at
disposal of the board are at their
discretion. The salaries of the statu
tory officers are provided for by law, and
City and County Auditor Is com
manded to audit them and the County
Treasurer to pay them without awaiting
any special appropriation by the Board
Supervisors, the money being taken
either from the general fund, the hospital
fund or the almshouse fund.
But the great bulk of the patronage of
, the board is in the way of voluntary ap
pointments, and the compensation de
i pends almost entirely upon the willing
ness of the Board of Supervisors to grant
the necessary appropriations asked for by
| the Board of Health. The Board of Su
pervisors, according to the programme of
revenge outlined by Kelly and "Mrntnins, ;
will refuse to appropriate money for the
payment of thes-- appointees of the Board :
of Health, and the result will be that :i?
a patronage proposition the Board of
Health will bring little profit to those :
ri sponslble for the snub to the bosses.
whose wrath hns been incurred by the al- j
l< pjed perfidy of Dan and the Governor.
Of course such a programme will seri- |
ously cripnlo the effectiveness of the
Hoard of Health and react upon the city,
but that fact will not be allowed to Inter
fere with the desires ot Crimmins and
Kelly. They â¢want revenge, and they are
; bound to have it. no matter at whnt cost
toothers. Fortunately the appointees of
the Governor go out of office when the
new charter goes into effect at the begin
ning of the new yar.
VISITED THE PRESIDIO.
Cadets of the Japanese Training' Ship
Inspected the Army Post.
The cadets of the Japanese training ship
Have) visited the Presidio on Friday
morning and were extended every facil
ity for Inspecting the post. There were
fifty-eight of the young midshipmen, un
der the command of J. Klyokawa. who is
the senior officer of the cadet?. The young
Japanese officers were met at the Clay
street wharf at 9 oclock by Captain No
ble of General Shaffer's staff. It was
originally intended- that they should be
taken to the Presidio on the Government
steamer McDowell and around the bay
to visit the different posts, but the Mc-
Dowell was being used by the Medical
Corps for the transfer of sick soldiers
from the City of Puebla. so th- party
took the Union-street cars to the Pre
sirtin.
When they arrived at the post they
called on Colonel Freeman, who is now
in command, to pay their respects. The
officers of the post then took the young
foreigners in hand and showed them
around. They inspected the barracks
with particular interest, and made many
inquiries about the things they saw. Cap
tain Noble -said that most of the young
men spoke excellent English, and that
nothing seemed too small to escape their
notice. The cadets were profuse in their
thanks for the courtesies shown them.
They informed Captain Noble that at the
Japanese Military School they have four
classes as at Annapolis. The cadets now
on the Hayei are classmates; The offi
cers of the Hayei will return the courte-

THE BAl* FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JUNE 4, 1599.
SOME FACTS FOR
AUDITOR WELLS
TO PONDER OVER
A Business Man for
License Collector.
FRED LEES' QUALIFICATIONS
INCIDENTS OF HIS FORMER AD
MINISTRATION.
Large Corporations Permitted to Es
cape Payment of Their Just
Obligations During His
Term.
Only a few days ago Auditor Asa R.
Wells stated in a printed interview that
bo far as he was concerned nobody but
a thorough business man should receive
the License Collectorship.
At the time he made that statement
Auditor Wells was pledged to vote for
Vred W. Lees for the position. Mr. Lees
has already tilled the office of License
Collector, and here is a small portion of
the record of his administration, show
ing his extraordinary' capabilities as a
"business man":
When Lees went cut of office two years
ago his successor found in checking up
the books that many of the largest busi
ness firms in the. cityâ wholesalers having
large interests and equally great influence
âwere the recipients of material favors
at the hands of the License Collector in
asmuch as they had not been paying the
municipal tax required by law. Their
licenses had been reduced, while the
smaller firms were compelled to pay the
full limit. This differential was speedily
corrected and the bunks of the license
office will show that these linns are now
paying $I.VKI v year more than they did
during Lies' term.
But the biggest hole In the office into
which the city's money was permitted to
pour was that connected with the opium
selling business. Lets' -successor found
hundreds of places In the city where
opium was sold which paid absolutely no
license, while many others only paid a
portion of the amount lixed by law. The
correction of this evil enriched the city
$1700 a quarter, <>r $6800 a year.
Another Instance ef Lees' remarkable
business ability was discovered when his
successor looked Into the accounts of the
Market Street Railway Company. The
books showed that for the quarter ending
in July 1897â that being the time Lees sur
rendered the officeâ the t>lg corporation
paid license on :>? large and twenty-four
small cars, makirie a total of H13626 a
quarter. Lees' Buocessor had an idea that
the Market street company had more cars
than that number, so nu made an investi
gation with the result that during the
lirst quarter of his incumbency the com
pany was compelled to pay a license on
)â¢:.'. Large and twenty-six small cars, bring
ing the total up to $io^> 7;. a auarter. a
difference in the city's favor of $022 50 a
quarter, or $2090 a year.
It will be remembered that this investi
gation brought the wrath of E. P. vining
down upon the head of the new Collector,
the railroad official making some very
significant statements about a "ncv,
broom" being "too fresh," and the. like.
Vining also in retaliation refused to allow
the outside deputies ><t the license office
to ride free, a privilege all of Lees' dep
uties enjoyed.
The law provides that all theaters shall
pay an annual license of $301, and that is
what they have been paying for the past
two years, but Lees' successor found that
under the old regime they had been pay
ing only $201 a year. There is no record
in the office to show that the other $l<>o
was offset by free theater tickets, al
though Lees has always had a fondness.
for the show.
These are some of the more notable in
stances of Fred W. Lees' business saga
city, not to mention the discovery of one
defaulter in the office at the time it
changed hands, and which was quickly
hushed up. There are innumerable in
stances Involving smaller amounts where
in, it is needless to Bay, the city invari
ably suffered.
Is this the kind of "business man" Audi
tor Wells had in mind when he pledged
his vote to Lees and announced himself
in the press, and knowing now some of
the secrets of the license office during his
former administration, is Mr. Wells still
prepared to place this "business man"
again in control of the office?
Auditor Wells, it is for you, sir, to an
swer.

PORT WARDENS
REFUSE TO GIVE
UP THEIR JOBS
Recent Appointees
Will Have to Fight.
BRAUNHART WILL NOT VACATE
INCUMBENTS PLAN A FIRM RE
SISTANCE.
They Claim That Governor Gage's Ap
pointments Are Illegal on Ac
count of Want of Senato
rial Confirmation.
Some rare political sport is in store for
the recent appointees of Governor Gage
to the four port wardenshlps of San
Francisco. The present occupants declare
that the Governor's appointments are il
legal, and that they will resist all at
tempts to oust them from their offices.
The four incumbents are Samuel Braun
hart, State Senator as well as port
warden; Henry R. Atwood, Nelson
Provost and Percy Henderson. Governor
Gage's appointees, announced Friday, are
Charles F. Kenneally. F. W. Burnett, R.
E. Nickells and Charles Spear. The first
quartet have determined to stay in office
despite the Governor, and in no smiling
way refuse to surrender their seats of
power to the new appointees. The rea
sons for the intended resistance to the
gubernatorial powtr of the in
cumbents are founded on what they assert
to be an illegality in the appointment of
the new port wardens. They claim that
an appointment by the Governor is not
legal unless the Senate confirms it by
open and express ratification. With the
Political Code and the Supreme Court
decisions in their hands, they wave de
fiance at the chief executive of the State,
and will hold on tenaciously to the offices
which ex-Governor JBudd placed within
their grasp.
Samuel Braunhart is of firm mind in re
gard to his newly-formed resolution to
defy the Governor. "There are many and
valid reasons why the recent appoint
ments should be rented," he said last
night. "In the first place. Gage's men
can not qualify under the law, and con
st Quently the appointees would not be
port wardens. Section 368 of the Political
Code declares in positive terms what
omi ers must hold by gubernatorial ap
pointment with the consent of the Senate,
l-ntil the Senate ratifies these appoint
ments they will not stauid under the law,
"It is the duty of the incumbents to re
fuse to be unseated when their successors
cannot hold. On this ground alone I will
still refuse to surrender my position, for
I cannot as a good citizen yield my office
to one who is unable to qualify. The con
sent of the Senate not having been se
i .!â¢â  <!, and, following a number of Su
preme Court decisions which hold that
mere expiration of term does not create
a vacancy, we feel that we are acting in
consonance with good citizenship and our
duty to the State if we refuse to relin
quish what we hold by authority and'
right. "â¢
There is another code section which ap
plies directly to Governor Gage's ap
pointees, and that is section 250, subdivi
sion v, which, declares in mandatory terms
that two at U ast of the port wardens of
thia city must be master mariners:
Charles Kenneally is tee keeper of a livery
stable; T. W. Burnett is a photographer;
R. E. Nickells is a farmer, and Charles
Spear was fi former County Recorder of
Alameda. This selection will at least nul
lify two of the recent appointments.
Another mooted point relates to the ex
piration of the term. The commission
reads that tne port warden shall hold
office for four years from the time of the
Issuance <>f the commission. Braunhart's
term is the only one which expires at this
time, the others having some period to
run. At any rate, there is a tangle and
a fight brewing as well. The courts will
undoubtedly lie called on to settle the
difficulty ami untie the knot.

BURIAL OF INDIGENT DEAD.
Finance Committee Makes Provision
for Burials Pending a Read
justment of Funds.
A representative from the Board of
Health appeared before the Finance Com
mittee of the Board of Supervisors on
Friday afternoon and asked that funds
be provided to defray the expenses at
tending the burial of the indigent dead,
the contractor having refused to make
further burials until his bills, which have
been held up for several months because
of lack of funds, are paid. Auditor Wells
was consulted about the matter and after
a consultation it was agreed to pay for
present burials out of the urgent neces
sity fund pending a readjustment of the
funds now available in the city treasury
so as to provide for the payment of the
overdue demands of the contractor.
The Health Department was instructed
to arrange and provide for the burial of
the indigent dead until this readjustment
is made.

A Tale of Mother's Love.
It Is a story of love cast asideâ ambition, despair, neglect, wrnnc,
Imprisonment, discovery, forgiveness, repentance and a second love.'
It is as true as truth and tho last Bcene of this drama in real life
is set within the walls of San Quentln, where two souls, who traveled
the bewildering by-ways of ih" world, at last entered the prison
gates to pay the penalty of ilirir pins.
Tt is a talo of lost love and ;i love that was found within th^
prison walls.
A story of how "Cupid" triumphed over bolts and bars under the
surveillance of turnkey and guard. And of how, even in this criminal
quarantine, where love's shut out and strife's shut in, a billet doux,
wrapped in tinfoil and tossed over the prison wall, changed the whole
prospect of four lives.
In the woman's ward at San Qirentin a happy prisoner Is count
ing time by the minutes to her day of freedom, Just a few weeks
hence; the day that will see her united to her mother and child, who
have mourned her an df-ad all thes^ twelve silent years.
Her name Is Mr*. Jennie Hastings, and she has nearly finished
hT term of two and a half years for grand larceny.
And her prison lover, who has been discharged and is impatiently
waiting to marry her?
He was known in San Quentin merely by his number, 14,604; but
his name is R. N. Cook, and his sentence of twelve years for robbery
terminated only two months since.
And thereby hangs this tale.
It is a genuine romance of the wild "West kind and begun nearly
seventeen years ago on a ranch near Santa Monica.
It began at the altar, when Jennie, the rancher's only daughter,
plighted her vows with the man whose name she still bears.
The happy bride was as talented as she was pretty, and .two
years of city life had added much to her charm of manner: but, alas,
twp years had done even more, for It filled her home with admirers,
who predicted for her a wonderful stage career. But in two years
Hastings had deserted her and she was left with a wee, helpless baby
girl, who instead of a blessing proved only a burden to the now
thoroughly ambitious woman, who from the stage had determined
to win the plaudits of the world. So she carried the child back to
the old ranch home that she had left but two short years before.
She remained with her mother until Baby Frances Xvas one year
old and then she returned to San Francisco, filled with the hope of
an earnest heart and unsophisticated ways.
But where were the friends who had encouraged her, the
memory of -whose words still rang sweetly upon her ear? She found
them now strangely silent. They had only praised her .while she
entertained them. This also she remembered.
The Path to the Penitentiary.
One day she awake to the fact that her purse "was empty and
that her promise of a theatrical engagement, like the rainbow's pot
or fold, was ever Just ahead. The first thing her friends did was
â¢ â¢ â¢

to advise her to pet a place as nurse, or else take plain sewing, and
not one, of all she had known, even cared that her heart was break
ing for a word of < lfort.
Her spirit was crushed, mit her pride arose: She would never
go back to the old folks until she had fought and fought bravely for
tho place that she was sure to win. Sh<> continued to write home to
her mother, but the dates of her letters grew wider and wider apart.
Finally they ceased altogether. Weeks and months passed by and
at last word came that she was dead.
The tidings were sent from a hospital in a far-off Eastern town.
Jennie was dead, bui the other daughter was at home to cheer the
sorrowing mother, and oh, how jealously she was guarded with her
protecting love.
What was the true story of the supposed dead daughter?
Over this broad land she struggled with life's changes, tempta
tions and troubles. Youth was taxed, money gone, and the buffets
of the world crowded her at last Into devious paths until she stood
alone with her burden of crime ai the threshold of San Quentin.
She stood alone, because she would not acquaint her mother with
her life of shame. No one knew who she really was; she simply
bore a number and was convicted of a crime for which she was
paying the penalty.
â¢ * *
One day there came into the woman's ward a messenger in
convict garb from the commissary department. This messenger was
Trusty <v.ok. Jennie Hastings was in the yard.
Tiny simply stood stock still and stared at each other.
it was a case of love at firs! sight.
It was the only spark of divine hope that had ever come into
her troubled life.
There was never much change for conversation because Prisoner
Cook was always chaperoned by the watchful guard, but a nod and
a glance were sufficient and served to strengthen the bond of sym
pathy that drew tho two prisoners closer day by day. But they
found means to communicate without being detected, as ingenious
prisoners will.
Srcret Correspondence in the Prison.
Then came long letters, â¢â â  litien previously, and exchanged while
the guard's back was turned.
High noon was the unusual hour chosen by them for their court
ship. At that hour the matron went to lunch.. On either side of the
high separating prison wall they wrote their letters, then wrapping
them in tinfoil they tossed them over; to be caught, unwrapped and
read by the rover on either side.
This was the way they courted each day until they were dis
covered. It was a wooing wholly suggestive of martial times; the
bombardment was real and the surrender mutual. Meanwhile they
had become engaged and the wedding day was set for the early fall.
In a few weeks Jennie Hastings will be free.
Two months ago Convict Cook's term of twelve years expired.
He passed from the prison's hateful shadow with far less Joy than
he had measured would be his, years before, because he was leaving
his sweetheart behind.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Now comes the strangest and most dramatic part of the whole
story, and it all ramp through the discharged convict trying to get
â work and prepare a home for his bride against the day when she
also would be discharged from Pan Quentin.
The people whom Cook had known at the time of his arrest no
longer trusted him.
Who would employ a convict?
There was but one thing to do; he would go to some place where
he was unknown and begin fife all over again.
After repeated efforts to obtain work and failing utterly he
mounted his wheel and started for Southern California. He had
something to live for now. He would work and save and make a
home for his promised wife.
He stopped at every ranch on his way to inquire for work and
he applied at every town through which he passed.
At every turn he was informed that ranchers were laying off
their men and merchants were discharging their clerks.
Then Fate, with irresistible purpose, guided his steps aright.
She led him straight to the hearth of Jennie Hastings' home. Straight
to the mother who believed her daughter was dead. He had no idea
it was the home of his promised bride, and they, of course, had no
suspicion that he was an ex-convict and had met the supposed dead
daughter.
Strange Caper of Fate.
With them the ex-convict found rest from his travels, employ
ment and most of all â a blessing denied him for many years â a home.
It was a home of peace, and to the man who had rested uneasily
from the jutemill labor, It was like a glimpse of Paradise.
The saint-like face of the grandmother and the innocent prattle
of Frances, the girl, hallowed the hours after work and slowly but
surely softened his nature.
He had been in this home but two weeks, when one night, after
the chores were done, Frances whispered in her grandmother's ear:
"Liet us ask the new man into the parlor; he looks so hungry for
sympathy. Perhaps he would like to hear me play and sitig."
"Yes, yes," sanctioned the grandmother. "Who knows what his
lot in life has been? Ask him in, my child."*
When the stranger entered the parlor that evening his roving
eyes lighted on a portrait on the wall. Under his breath he said:
"Jennie! What is she to them?"
The brother noted his look of recognition and said: "You have
met my sister! Where?"
It was a question of man to man.
"Yes, where?" echoed the anxlons, white-haired mother.

"One moment." pleaded the mother, "tell m<\ Isn't she really

Slowly the answer came, as if drawn against his will: "She Is

Very early the next morning Jennie Hastings' brother started
for San Quontin; there might be some mistake after all, the family
thought, and he would be able to learn the truth.
The Telegram Told the Truth.
On the following day the telegraph wire ticked out the glad
tidings to the anxious mother:
"It is our Jennie; we have found her at last."
That night, when all had gone to sleep, Frances crept from her
bed and wrote a letter to the mother who had abandoned her so long
ago, and it read:
My DaTling Mamma: We are so happy that you will h* with us

ask him to let you come? If you think it will make any difference I
will writs and tell him that you intend to he good now. and perhaps
ho will let you go. I will tell him what an angel grandma is, for I

I can hardly wait until you come. Just to think! [ was only a

We are all going to love you so much. Poor Mr. Cook wipes his
eyes whenever he looks at grandma's radiant face, and she says we
must love him for telling us of you. and that we can help to make
him good by our prayers and kindness.

A SON FRANCISCO FLAG
HOISTED AT MALOLOS
IT Is not generally known that an ex- |
San Francisco boy was the first to
hoist the Ftars and stripes in Aguin
aldo's capital city of .Malolos or. that
a San Francisco lady furnished the
banner which proclaimed the sov
ereignty of the United States In the rebel
capital; but the distinction of raising the
first flag undoubtedly belongs to Lewis
Hoffman, who for seven years was a resi
dent of this city, and the flag In question
was the gift of Mrs. C. C. O' Donnell.
Lv Hoffman is a soldier In the First Mon
tana Regiment, now doing duty In the
Philippines. He Is not a shoulder
strapped officer; does not even sport the
chevrons of a sergeant or corporal; but is
Just a plain private and Is proud of It.
A friend In this city recently received a
letter from him and his description of
scenes In the troubled Islands are de
cidedly graphic ; v >
Private Hoffman Is the cook of Com

lay in front of Caloocan within 500 yards
of the Insurgent trenches. He says. "the
niggers used to drive me oat of the kitch
en every morning with their Mausers and
I never got to cook a meal in peace."
Lv Is a patient chap and never put up a
protest until one day the Filipinos shot
a hole through his coffee pot Just as he
was about to take It off the fire.
In his letter he gives the facts concern

The melancholy youth blushed to his hair. Whack exclaimed:
"The girl you met at Narragansett that summer, two years ago? Jee

Here Van der Ruytcr made his first remark:

Tom shook his hand gratefully.
"She's a corker and no mistake," announced Whack, "that fa, if fÂ»he

"Let us understand the facts of the case," saJd Barton, with his slow
deliberation. "1 ti ink I recall them. Twrt years ago, during your fur
lough, you met Miss OBbourne at Narragansett. pp e r and fell in love with
her. She was pretty, moderately well off, indifferent and ambitious She
refused you. and you came back with a face as long as the one you've Kot
on now, and drove ua nearly frantic for two months. Then her imaee
seemed to fade, and wo, aJso, were allowed to forget her. Now after this

GOOD NEWS FOR
STAMP GETTERS
ANEW postage stamp has Just been
Issued by the Government of New
Zealand, and It la one which 1b
likely to prove of special Interest
to philatelists. The Government
decided some time ago to establish
a pigeon messenger service between Auck
land and Great Barrier Island, which Is
several miles from the mainland. This
service was the more necessary as there
was neither a cable nor any other.regu
lar connection between the Island and
Auckland. ;V.- :'^:
The experiment was tried and proved
so successful that It. was decided to send
letters regularly by pigeons, and It Is for
this purpose that the new stamp has been
Issued. Letters or dispatches sent in this
way will be known a* "pigeongrams" and
each must be written on a small, thin,
sheet of paper. The address must be
written at the top of this sheet and the
stamp will be affixed to the right hand
corner.
On the stamp appears the picture of a"
pigeon on the wing and carrying an en
velope in Its beak. Above the picture are
the words "Great Barrier Island" and be
low are the words "Special Post," while
at each side are the words "One Shilling. "
Letters can be sent by these swift mes
sengers twice each month. Even at this
slow rate the first issue of stamps will
soon be exhausted, as It consists of only
1800.

NOVEL COURT
SHIP IN JAPAN
A JAPANESE girl who desires to get
married does not hesitate to in
form the public of her desire. In
a recent Issue of the Japanese Jour
nal, Kanazawa Bhlmbum, one of
these girls, who signs herself "Ho
suljoshi," Is very outspoken on this point,
as the following notice shows: "I, the un
dersigned, am a pretty . girl with " abun
dant hair, .flowerlike fÃce, perfect eye
brows and a good figure. I have money
enough to take life easy and to enable
me to spend my years with some beloved
man who will ever be my companion and
who can admire the flowers with me by
day and the moon by night. If any clever,
accomplished, handsome and fastidious
gentleman Is disposed to accept this of
fer, I can assure him that 1 will be true
to him for life, and that after life Is over
I will be ready to be burled with him In
one grave." -
It Is not an unheard of thing for Euro
pean or American girls to advertise for
husbands, but it is very doubtful if any
European or American naper has ever
contained such a poetical matrimonial ad
vertisement as this one. Moreover, It Is
very doubtful if any European or Ameri
can girl would ever think of offering to
share the same grave with the gentle
j man who might accept her offer or mar-
I riage. Verily, they do things differently

SUICIDES AND
THE WEATHER
GOOD suicide weather," the gTizzled
old sergeant behind the desk of one
of the East Side police stations ob
served, as he glanced out at the
dull, overwhelming clolds from whlchHH
rain sifted down In a never-ending
drizzle.
"A good day for suicides over there,"
he continued, musingly. "If a German
1b going to kill himself he waits for just
such a day as this. Even If he don't In
tend to kill himself, three or four days
like this will drive him to It. We'll be
apt to have three or four cases reported
before roll call.
"Now, it's different with a Frenchman.
When a German feels blue It makes him
all the bluer If the weather's bad. But
a Frenchman, when he Is crossed in love
or has gone broke, thinks the weather is
sympathizing with him If It rains when
he is feeling badly. When he makes up
his mind to commit suicide he'll Invaria
bly carry out his Intention on a sunshiny
day. The world's brightness seems only
to mock him." " y â 
"And what about the Irishman, Ser
geant?" aeked the new policeman.
"Look here, young man," Bald the Ser
geant, with Just a suggestion of Lim
erick In his tone, "Irishmen don't commit
suicide. 1 When an Irishman gets broke
and blue he don't kill himself. Not
much! He goes home and beats his wife
every time. ' ' â¢ " . '

I suppose you want to know how she received me.
I stood before her for about forty seconds before she looked up. Finally
her eyes traveled slowly from my shoes to my face acd rested there with a
look of blank unrecogrUtlon.
"Don't you know mo?" I stammered. I was ready to cry.
"Why of course," she said, with her delidoiuj draw!. "It's Tommy
Van der Ruyter. You've grown."
I collapsed, but on the sand, and at her feet.
She did not addreep another word to me for five minutes, but permitted
ft ridiculous youth with a pereweaty face, as my little niece would say, to
relate a stupid anecdote while she looked out over the water. When Â»ne
ppoke It was to me. The youth might have been babbling to the breakers.
"What a hideous object a man In a bathing suit Is!" she said.
I assented eagerly, registering a vow that she should never see me In a
bathing suit.
"Theee sands are full of graves," she continued, "graves of burled
sentiment. The convex ones look like Jelly fish, the scrawny ones like the
punishment of Adam. Those that happen to be well built are merely re-*,
pulsive." y~
"We were all In the water yesterday ," one of the five murmured feebly. |
"My remarks applied to you. Fortunately. I have no sentiment to
bury."
I pitied those poor men.
A great flounder of a man came out of the water and flung himself
down before her.
"The siren of the sea cannot hold me while youâ" he began.
Bhe rose. She took her skirts with an expression of disgust which
made even Innocent me shiver. She turned her back on the purpling, stam
mering offender (who, after all, had plenty of examples all round), and
said in a cool voice:
"Mr. Van der Ruyter, you may walk with me till It is time to go to the
Casino."
Boys, I'll tell you the rest to-morrow.â T.
Wednesday Morning.
Tm up again at 7 to write to you. I was getting writer's paralysis last
night. I'm going to make this letter like a conversation In a novel.
We are strolling up the beach (Just after I left off In my last).
Myself: "How awfully JoUy this Isâ to be walking all alone with you.
These last two years have been like two centuries. But now It seems Ilk*
the same old summer."
She: "What a kid yon are!"
Myself: "I know; but then, you see, I'll grow. You have. You're ten
years older than you were two years ago. Now, don't get angry â you re
more beautiful than ever. What I mean is that you have the air of one
who has exhausted the world. It's tremendously fetchingâ though, to be
sure, that first Indefinable charm has gone forever. (Catch on, boys?) But
It Isn't every woman who can be three or four women In one lifetime. I
should say you could be five or six a year If you liked."
She; ""iou seem to have an analytical turn of mind. So had I at your
age."
Myself: "That's a good pot shot. If you ever did consent to marry
me I should feel as if I were taking a sort of BHIS to wife. And If I re
member aright, I am three days older than you are. But such Is the un
even gait of the sexes. It is Just about time for you to get over being pro
posed to and for me to begin proposing."
She: "You'll do the bullyfng-Josslng act better when you're had two
years' hard practice."
Myself (hurriedly): "Look at that big fellow rolling in. Whs,t a life
of pleasure it Is here. People seem to forget when they come to Narragan
pett that there i? any other object but pleasure In life. What an awful set
of jays tlmse men were you were talking to. Don't wonder you looked
bored. Suppose New York society men are the same."
To which brilliant series of remarks she made no reply whatever.
Myself (after a painful pause): "Have you been here long 0 ' i
She: "Two weeks."
Myself: "Like it?" ,
She: "As well as anything."
Myself: "Going to stay a" summer?"
She: "I never make plans.
Myself: "You drift?"
She: "I drift."
Myself (feebly): "Think you will ever drift Into matrimony V
She: "Certainly."
Myself: "Engaged?"
She: "No."
Here she turned and gave me the look and the blase. I proposal.
She: "It's time to ero to the Casino."
We went to the Casino Ever seen it, boys? If s like Americaâ a little
of everything. Shingle roofs above Btone walls. Romanesque towers and
Moorish corridors. Pillars of cobblestones and varnished wooden ceilings.
Still, it is pretty, and when swarming with people looks very brilliant.
\W sat ourselves, with the rest of the crowd, on the inner veranda
overlooking the lawn and the sea. The music played; the people Jabbered.
Every third girl had a boy. Bo did the young matrons. The coming man
should be something remarkable, his education begins so early.
There are any number of good looking men here; but they are not In
it with the beardless youths. Half a dosen girls were pointed out as belles
from various Stnt.es. They had several boys apiece.
She was surrounded, of course, but I managed to plant myself at her
ear.
'â 'Why do you treat my proposals with contempt?** I murmured under
cover of tho music.
"Why have vnu the audacity to propose to met"
"What you don't try for you don't get. I want yon. and how to thun
dpr nm I to set you If I don't propose? You wouldn't propose to me, X
suppose?"
"I certainly should not."
"â \Vhv nm I po audacious? I am as good as any of this lot."
"Rather better. Your name is good, but you haven't any money f
I Bhwrtflered, hut resolved to admiro frankness in woman.
"T Intend to he a rich man inside of five years."
â  â  :"opment she treated with silent contemptâ the contempt of
the longf-headed nineteenth century American maiden.
After a lons interval: "Will you think it over?"
"Think what over?"
"Mv proposal."
"My dear Tommy, you don't expect me to think about that. Fancy \
exercising one's Rray matter over a proposal â and from you!"
â  T jumped up iVi a huff and went upstairs, determined not to look at her
attain for twenty-four hours. Alas! I found myself gazing down upon her
from the upper gallery, which overlooks the lower at right angles, inside
(.f five minutes. I assured myself I was admiring the charming: spectacle â
th<> irregular rows of pretty faces and gay gowns and bright parasols, set
off by the polished wooden background and the green lawn In front. But
I wasn't. I was staring straight at her, and I knew that she knew It, al
though she never looked up. I jerked about and walked clear out to the
i rid of the lonir gallery, hetween the pillars of cobblestones, sat down by
the parapet and gazed out upon the ocean. But I wasn't admiring the
water-scape. I was meditating. The result of my meditations was this:
T must da as Barton suggestedâ l must dazzle her. I couldn't go to the old
lady and tell her I had a fortune because, like Q. W., I never He, but I
must make her think so by inference. Of this my conscience approved.
All's fair in love. T shall entertain her, devote myself to her amusement,
m;ike her conspicuous by my distinguished attentions, and perhaps her
heart and ambition will he touched.
Boys, how do you think I'm getting on?â T.
Friday.
I've made my first deal. Oave her a dinner at Sherry's last night.
It costâ But never mind, IvÂ« got enough left to Ret'married onâ
that Is if she doesn't insist upon too mnoh style. Not that she has
accepted me yet. Well, that dinner was ffiven in style. You can bet
your chances of a war on that. There were eight of vs â she. me, her
mother, my sister and four of her friends, that I told her to invite.
I carried it yff like a lord. The old lady beamed and paid me marked
attention. I heard her whisper to one of the party, "One of the old
Van der Ruyters of New "iork. you know." My sister, who over
looks the Oshourne pedigree because she's dead fond of me and is
fnsrinated by her, is helping me alonjr beautifully. The old lady
tried pumping her to find out if I'd inherited a fortune, and my sis
ter. wi;h reserved and modest mien. Intimated that I had unexpect
edly come into a neat little sum. Whirh Is true; you who are vege
tat inn at West Point being- painfully aware of the fact. I saw her
look surprised once or twice, ami then she put on added Indifference,
so I shouldn't think she was impressed. The other men looked
glum, which I take as a good sign.
We had driven out in great state, but when we had sat round on
the veranda for an hour or two after dinner we young folks con
cluded to walk home In the moonlight. I walked with her, you can
bet your hopes of a silk hat on that. And she thawed, hoys! by
heaven, she thawed! Her eyes blazed with a soft, dreamy blaze for
five consecutive minutes and returned to the charge later. And there
was a sort of gulf stream through the cold depths of her voice.
How's that? II Is true she didn't pay the slightest attention when
I proposedâ but, boys, I'm getting there.â T.

down to the bearh to where the snip was
purely approaching her doom. There was
no wind, but the never ceasing swell of
the Pacific was i ling vast rollers on
the rocks and carrying the vessel with

When but a few feet oft the shore the
ship struck on the sunken rocks and
commenced to fill. The crew, seeing
their danger, attempted to come ashore
in the ship's boats, and some were over
turned. The islanders worked like, heroes,
and In a few hours every man was safe
on the island. Borne had met with very
narrow escapes, having been dashed
ashore on pieces of wreckage from the
fast-breaking ship.
Among those who had the hardest time
in reaching the shore was Coffin, who
was the boatswain. Several times it was
necessary for the islanders to rush out
into the angry breakers to secure the

EL MAHDI:
REGARDING the disintejment and
mutilation of ihe remains of the
Mahdi by the English after the bat
tle of 6mdunn<a.n, the Mai
Guardian has a story fr.>m Its spe-
cial correspondent. The story was
pleaned from sonip of the non-commis
sioned officers on the Nile gunboats, who
put it from the men who actually en
gaged In this place of diplomatic barbar
ism.
The day after the Omdurma.'i battle,
v.h.re the dervish.s died in their thou
sands. Major Gordon, they say. went on
board one. of the gunboats and then took
with him a small party of Royal Marine
artillerymen to the land. None of the
Egyptians on board were taken. "They
chatter too much..." explained a sergeant.
â¢â¢When you have experience of them they
are a poor race of beings. A dervish i* in
ail parts altogether more of a man. The
Egyptian cannot stand alone. 1
The little party marched directly to the
tomb of the Mahdi. The tomb was â de
scribed as "like a big square barn, built
of half-baked bricks and slabs of mud
mortar."
It had a round dome on the top, which
had been so worked as to fit the square
buildmg below. The body of the ftfahdl
lay on what the artillerymen ternnd "an
erection," perhaps half the height of a
man. Bet i:p in the. middle, of the tomb.
It had an encircling rail made witn pieces
of brass taken from English implements
or furniture, and was decorated with
. n her trinkets, perhaps religious symbols.
The body was wrapped in white and col
cloth, sewn together. "Hut whether
it had been embalmed." said another of
the artillerymen! "I could not say, hav

ship off the island gave all an opportu
nity to leave. Hy this time- Coffin was so
desperately In love with thf> little widow
that ho r>|poted to remain, and when the
island authorities concluded that he had
resided there long enough to know his
own mind he was married In the little
banana-leaf barn that did duty as a
chapel.
The Island life suited Coffin Immensely.
Pitcairn Is an ideal honie for a sailor with
a wife. Lord Byron beautifully told the
story "t existence on this is.and when
he wrote:
New Story of How He Met
HisEndand
What Became of His Body.
I ter for those In authority," one was told.
However, It was presently said that the
order was Riven to take the body from
where It lay and to- sever the head from
the trunk. "The corporal went to that
end. On lifting the head It broke clean
away from the body, and he heli. It In his
hands."
The body was then wrapped up. weight
ed and carried across the thr.ee, mile*
that lay between the tomb and the Nile
and at once cast Into the river. "I never
beard that anything was seen of. It
again." said one artilleryman, "and the
fart Is it must have been washed away
along the bed of the river." Another
added that the dervishes are. .of course,
i essentially superstitious, and. that they
i might in the. future, no doubt, be Im
posed on by the production of another
dead body. "But," he added," "whatever
may be said of the body, they will never
get the bead of their Mahdi."
"What became of the head?"
"It is a very short story. The head was
carried on board the gunboat and put in
to an empty kerosene can one of those
square cans, you know, that oil is kept in.
It stopped there a few days. The other
officers used to come aboard and say,
'Gordon, show us that head,' and the cor
poral, under orders, would then lift it out.
None of them would touch it. It was not
nice. l might say that the Mahdl must
have been a fearfully ugly man. The
lower jaw protruded further than in any
man I have ever seen. The forehead was
not particularly highâ an Arab. His
hair was jet black. The lower part, of
one side of the face was gone decayedâ
and we took off part of his beard. It is
hero In Eastney. I have a piece myselfâ
a fine, glossy, black, apparently the hair
of a man in his prime.
"Aftor the head had remained a few
days, in the can B wooden box was made
and it was packed in that. It was sent

After a. few years the secluded Mfc on
the Island began to i>e irksome to Coffin,

By this time there were two or ttir hll

Coffin would look with wistful eyes at
their departing sails.

IN a recent number of Rt. George, the
organ of the Birmingham Ruskin

writes an interesting article on Mr.
Knskin as he is to-day. As to Mr.
Ru^kin's condition, physically, he is
"very weak and frail, but mentally he is
quite Clear, and though unable \.q do any
work whatever he still takes a lively in

Mr. Whitehouse says that his face "has

It is still the face which Professor Her

The only difference is a long 1 white beard.

one of them. He confided to me the little
romance of his life and also the fact that
some of the leaders of the little com
munity "kept an eye on him." Coffin's
remark made It very clear that a dozen
years on Pitcairn, with the prospect of
being buried there, was not all that an
American could desire. He hinted very
strongly that if a good opportunity were
to present Itself he might leave the island
without going through the formality of
saying good-by.
"It was all very well at first," said Cof

four children and to his cottage which
was "a little more comfortable than any
other shanty on the island," and where
there is no need of work to secure a liv

plainly be seen that poor Coffin would
willingly have changed places with any
body on board the Florence even with
midnight wheels, reefing topsails off the
Horn, holystoning decks and swinging
yards in the doldrums, and .all the other
discomforts of a deep-water voyage
ahead of him if he could only once more
reach port.
Nor was it any imagination of Coffin's
that caused him to think the Islanders
were suspicious of his desire to leave his
family behind him, for while he walked
about the deck, went into the cabin or
the foVsl, one or two of the island crews
always followed his movements with their
eyes.
As the length of Coffin's term on the
Island increased so old his family, and
now there arc six little Coffins, some of
them well alonp in years, running around
on Pitcairn. It is probably duo to the
fact that the older boys are now able to
support their mother that madÂ© it com
paratively easy for Coffin to return to his
native country. Early this year tho mis
sionary schooner Pitcairn made its annual
visit to the island. The Pitcairn Is the
property of the Seventh-day Adventists,
whose headquarters are in Oakland. In
1886 the islanders, who had up to that time
been following the tenets of the English
Episcopal church, joined themselves to
the Seventh-day Adventists, and Coffin
was among those who concluded that the
si v< nth day of the week (Saturday) is the
day hi 1 "" which all true Christians should
worship, ami not Sunday, as taught by
tin- English church.

lowed to drink no alcoholic liquors. Con
stantino's father is a portrait painter in
Switzv I'land, and neither of his parents
is over the normal size.
Another well-known eight-footer was
Chang, "th<- Chinese giant," who at
tracted much attention in this country
and Europe a few years ago. It was said
that Chang had a sister who was eleven
inches taller than her big brother, but
she died young.
In the old days it was believed that the
size of man had gradually decreased
since the flood. One Henrion. a French
man, evolved a "comparative scale" hy
which Adam stood 123 feet 9 inches: and
Eve was a sweet little person only lis
feet 0 inches high.
Grandfather Noah was twenty feet
shorter than Adam, and Abraham was
only 28 feet tall. Moses was set down as
being l.'J feet high, and Hercules as \<>
feet. The "comparative scale" of this
learned man is only a subject for laugh
ter now. hut it was accepted seriously
in the days in which he wrote. The
height of Goliath has been estimated va
riously. The best authorities, such as
Josephus and the Vatican copy of the
Septuagint. set the Philistine champion
down as being "four cubits and a span"
tall, which would make him a little over
S feetâ about the size of Chang and Col
onel Goshen.
A tall story of a tall man is that told
by Boccaccio. He says that the remains
of this monster were discovered in his
own lime in a cave in Sicily, and were
those of a man 400 feet high. The learned
Athanaslus Kircher. a Jesuit priest, vis
ited the scene of the alleged discovery
and found that the cave was only 30 feet
high, while the only remains which could
be shown to him were the fossil bones of
an elephant.
The first modern giant of whom there is
authentic record was the porter of Queen
Elizabeth, whose portrait by Zmchero
hanj;s in Hampton Court Palace. He was
a Dutchman and was 7 feet H inches tall.
James 1 had a porter, Walter Parsons,
who was of the same height. Will Evans,
who succeeded Parsons and served as
porter for Charles I, was 7 feet 8 inches
high. Cromwell also had a giant porter,
one Daniel, who stood 7 feet 6 inches.
Coffin is destined to have an important
part in the lineage of Pitcairners. There
are but seven family names among the
120 inhabitants. They arr Young, Mc-
Coy. Christian, Buffett. Warren, Butler
and Coffin, and only Coffin of the original
families now lives.
When the Pitcairn was ready to leave
the Island, her captain desired a man to
Bail before The mast. None of the island
ers were willing to leave, but Brother
Coffin Just longed for another trip to sea-
He consulted with the powers of the
island, and to his great delight he was
permitted to go as an able seajnan in the
Pitcairn to Tahiti, the general impression,
being that he would return to Pitcairn
v.-hen the missionary ship made her next
call.
The Pitcairn went 10 Tahiti, and there
Brother Coffin bade her good-by. The
San Francisco brig Galilee was about to
leave for California and Coffin left with
her. On the brig was also a missionary
returning from Pltcairn, and he and
Brother Coffin frequently discussed the
pest and the future. Coffin always as
sured his friend that it was his Intention
to return to Pitcairn after he had spent
a goodly period among the enjoyments of
' his native country, but the missionary
pays It will not be sui prising If Coffin
never goes back.
Coffin is now 63 years old. Over thirty
years ago he was a sailor on board one
of the United States vessels at the cap
ture of Fort Donelson in the Civil War.
On this particular occasion Coffin -was on
one of the river boats acting In conjunc
tion with the land forces under General
Grant. He declares that he is entitled to
a considerable amount of prize moneyl
and that tho matter was being adjudi
cated when he sailed on his last voyage
which ended so abruptly at Pltrairn. HÂ«
has now gone East to look up the record
and see If he be rich or poor. In any
event, he insists that he will have no dif
ficulty in proving his right to a pension
because of injuries received during tha
Civil War.
"Coffin is a pretty good fellow," eai<f
the missionary who arrived in Oakland
last week, "but his nature is not such as
to cause him to fall in love with the con
ditions on Pitcairn Island. He assures me
that he is a sincere Seventh-day Advent
ist. but if so. Brother Coffin has a few
ideas of his own about Adventlsm. He
cannot rid himself of his family obliga
tions, because there is no such thing as
divorce in the social economy of Pitcairn
Island. He always professes great affec
tion for his family, but the position of
Coffin is perhaps absolutely unique. Ho
has had a rare experience and it cannot
be compared, so far as I know, with thÂ«
experience of any other man living. He
was certainly a good husband and looked
well after his children. He was always
doing something for their comfort, but
it could plainly be seen that there was
always within him that irresistible de
sire to return to where life was more
pleasant to a man brought up as he Was.
It may be possible that after a few years
( offln may actually long to return to his
island home and those he has left there."
It is not surprising that Coffin found life
on Pitcairn burdensome. It Is perhaps
the only perfect altruistic settlement on
earth. Its people cannot, even if they
would, go outside the closely drawn lines
of government which regulate that social,
political, civil and religious life. The
island is but three miles one way and a
half mile the other way, and there is no
moans of leaving it and returning at
pleasure. There is almost an utter ah
sence of amusement as Americans under
stand the word, and there is absolutely
no field for ambition. Everybody shares
alike, and when a passing ship gives a few
sacks of flour or wheat or a few barrels
of pork or beef to the islanders it is all
put in a common storehouse and distrib
uted equally.
In many instances, when there are not
wives or husbands enough on the island
to fill the demand communication Is
opened with the friend? of the islanders
on Tahiti, which is KM miles to ihe west
ward. When the City of Florence railed
at Pitcairn on the occasion to which I
have already referred a mail was made
up, consisting of eighteen letters, all of
which were addressed to Tahiti. These
letters were carried eastward around the
Horn and landed at Southampton. The
letters, after going to London, were sent
to New York, thence to San Francisco,
thence by steamer to the nearest island
to Tahiti and finally were carried to their
destination by schooner, having traveled
2."..iK)0 miles and taken nearly six months
to reacts h point 1306 miles distant from
where they were written.
Five years later Governor McCoy visited
Oakland and told me of the safe delivery
of the letters after their, long journey.
This incident conveys some idea of tlie
isolation of the little home on which Cof
lin spent twenty-flve years of his lifetime.

FOUND A RICH MINTE
THROUGH A DREAM
Has Just Sold It for Half a Million Dollars â Strange Experience of a Southern
Calif ornian.
LOS ANGELES, April 17.â Cave J. )
Couts of Becondldo Is known all \
over Southern California as the
man who dreamed, himself rich.
He discovered a wonderful gold
mine through a dream.
Cave Couts was a surveyor. He j
came from Indiana to California and ;
bought a ranch at Escondido in one of
the prettiest inland valleys of Southern
California, Several yearÃ ago, when
Major Harry Patton of this city was ap- i
pointed by th,Â» Government as agent to
allot lands to the Mission Indians, he se- ,
lected Cave Coutfl to be hiÃ engineer.
When he was ready to begin the work of
surveying the lands Major Patton went
to the CoutÃ ranch at Eecondldo and re- '
mained over night, and the start for the
Indian reservation waa made from there. ;
"My dear, this will be my last Burvey
lng trip," said Couts to his wife, as the
party was about to leave on the follow
ing morning. "We are soon to be rich,
and I shall give up surveying forever and
enjoy the blessings which richoÃ can
bring us. We will have more money than
we know what to do with, for I have
discovered a gold mlr.e."
There were no gol<s mines in the Escon- !
dido Valley, and of course the members
of the party were anxious to learn how
Mr. Couts could have made hiÃ dlscov- ;
cry. When he told them that he had dis
covered the mine in a dream they laugh
ed at him. but he assun-d them that he
considered it no laughing matter. He
had dreamed that he was going through
a wild, mountainous country and that in
one of the most inaccessible places in the â 
whole region h>; unexpectedly came upon
a little cabin, built of adobe bricks and
brush. There he found an old Mexican
woman, thi upant of the place,
and she directed him to a spring, where '
I â¢ went to sink** hie thirst. As he kneeled )
over the water and gazed Into Its clear,
depths he saw glittering particles in the
t^ir.'ls at I ... When he went
back to the cabin he asked the old woman
if there wai fvud in those mountains, and
ehe told him there was gold there in !
abundance. Then he woke up.
Several years after thatâ a little over |
three years, to be exactâ Mr. Couts was j
one day riding through the mountains j
the Julian mining district, in San i
Diego County, and lost his way. He had
followed a winding mountain trail for
â J miles, hoping it would bring him
to some habitation where he might in
quire his way. Suddenly he came out
upon a little clearing, in the center of
which was a cabin. There was a famil- i
iar look about the place, though Mr.
a was certain he had never been in \
those mountains before. But as he '
â  I around him at the rough and deep- ;
eoamed mountains and saw the forests
of pine above him and the rushing stream
below him in the canyon, he recognized
the scene.
"My dream!" he exclaimed. "This is
the place I saw in my dream." For dur
he three long years he had never
given up the hope that he would one day
find the golden mountain of his sleeping :
vision. And now it stood". before him!
Efe rode to the door of the cabin. An
old Mexican woman appeared. His voice
trembled as he asked her in Spanish if
there was not a spring near where he 'â 
could find a cool drink. She motioned '
with her hand, and he. went directly to I
tne spring. All happened exactly as it |
had in hln dream.
Hack ho went to the cabin and asked
the old woman tho very samo question
many lives, the determination of the
Arctic currents. If these casks emerge
some day, as It Is believed they will,
from the Arctic Soa and find lodgment
on the shores of Greenland, the scien
tists believe that this will be conclu
sive proof that it is possible for a yes
he hod asked in his dream: "Is there
any gold in these mountains?"
"Plenty," Bhe said; "It is In all the
rocks."
Then the old woman told him that her
husband had taken a great deal of gold
out of the mountains and that after he
wae dead her son had also found many
of the precious particles; but he, too, had
died, and she was all alone. She showed
him the hole they had dug in the moun
tain side, and the rough arrastra where
fhfy had ground up the ore and taken
out the metal. She ww waiting to sell
the little mountain ranch, she said, so
that she could go to San Diego and spend
the rest of her days there in comfort.
In ten minute? mnrp i "a\-p ("outs had
started for San Diego, and he rode there
as fast as his pinto pony would carry
him. He borrowed $5000 of friends, and
with that he bought the little ranch and
hired men to go there and open up the
mine.
The "Ranchita" mine was sold by Cave
Couts a few days ago to Gail Borden. the
condensed* milk millionaire, for half a
million dollars. Cave Couts dreamed
himself rich.

HeW Qovr\od Became a J*l\jsiciar\.
SHORTLY before his death Gounod
wrote a brief sketch of the manner
In which he became a musician, and
this has just beer, published for the
first time by the Petit Bleu of Paris.
It Is wholly from Gounod's pen, and as
an autobiographic fragment will surely
prove of much interest to all admirers of
the famous composer of "Faust."
"I was 13 years old," he begins, "and
was* a pupil at the Ifarcourt School. My
mother, a poor widow, was obliged to
1 work hard for her living, and had to
trudge through snow and sunshine in or
der in obtain the means for her children's
education. I was continually worried
over the thought that she was sacrificing
herself for me, and I longed for the day
when I could set her free from her un
worthy labor. Her views, however. In
regard to mine, differed from mine. She
had destined me for a university career,
whereas I ever heard an enticing voice
saying, 'You must be a musician.'
"One day I told my mother about my
heart's desire.
" Are you In earnest?* she asked.
" 'In dead earnest'
" 'And you will not go to the univer
sity?'
â â  'Never!'
" 'Where will you go then?'
" 'To the conservatory.'
"It was now her turn to say 'Never.'

FARMS WITH ELECTRICITY
NEAR St. Johnsvllle, N. V., Is a farm
of 350 acres belonging to G. R.

the current for lighting and heating as
well as supplying the power for other

This electric installation is the first of
I its kind ever used for doing the work of
farm hands.
All the mechanical energy' Is supplied by
nature, and the cost and maintenance of
the plant is inexpensive. It has demon

"My Dream." HÂ« Exclaimed as Soon as He Set Eyes on the Old Mexican Woman,
â dentist who delves in such matters
for the love of science and not money,
is an enthusiast. A man of means, he
is paying the entire expense of this
trial of casks out of his own pocket.
I asked him what he thought would be
the practical result of the experiment.
He said:
"What we hope and believe is, that
â ozne of the casks will find their way
to Greenland and be thrown upon
either the west or east ooast by that
current whloh first sweeps down on the
west side of Greenland, curves about it,
and then trends along; the eastern coast
for a distance. If these casks, or any
of them, Bucceed In making this trip
Intact, it is fair to draw the deduction
that a vessel, If she were properly
built, oould do the same thing.
"The oasks are the Invention of Chief
Engineer Melville, and I regard them
as furnishing the most common sense
and practical plan for getting at the
secret of the Arctic drift and current
yet devised. I have thought enough of
it to pay the expense myself, and be
lieve that eventually by means of this
experiment we Â«.re more likely to find
a way to reach the pole. Every one
knows what Nansen achieved with the
Fram. He believes If he had drifted
with the current Instead of with the
loe, he would have been quite likely to
drift directly across the pole.
"Here is what Engineer Melville has
to say about the casks: 'It will be ob
served that the casks are made after
the ordinary manner, with solid wood
en ends, fitted to bear on the ends of
the staves, not on the heads, held in
place by a brass rod, with conical
brasÃ nuts to hold the cone ends in
place. The cask is painted a heavy
black to preserve It from decay and to
help keep it watertight â black, that it
may readily be seen.
" 'If thrown into the open water,
they are apt to be drifted with the
winds. The deep ice, being affected by
under currents, will probably carry the
casks on a more correct drift. The
customary bung hole and bung are
fitted, the Intention being to place In
each cask a bottle, tightly corked, to
preserve â in case the cask should leak
âsuch records as It may seem proper
to place therein.
" 'The casks being properly prepared,
should be carried on a Government
vessel through Bering Strait, and set
adrift in sets of five, numbered con
secutively, commencing with the first
five at or near Herald Island, then pro
ceeding to the northward, along the
eastern edge of the Ice pack, until the
highest safe latitude Is obtained â say
latitude 75 degrees north, longtltude 170
degrees west from Greenwich. I sug
gest this latitude and longtitu/le be
cause the polar pack in the above lati
tude commences to crowd well over to
the eastward and toward the North
American archipelago, where other cur
rents are known to exist.
" 'There is no doubt the casks will
come out somewhere. Siberian drift
wood has been found on the northeast
erty. These waterfalls, one of which Is i
sixty feet and the other 180 feet high, fur
nish the power.
The owner of the farm employed the ;
Westtnghouse Company to put this
scheme in operation.
The smaller fall was used as the operat
ing power, and near it was built a power- i
house in which was placed a ISO-kilowatt !
WVstinghouse generator, connected with a
horizontal turbine operated by the water. |
From this central power-house the cur
rent is transmitted by wires to the dwell

era shores of Bennett Inland, on the
northeast point of Nova Zembla, on the
eastern coast of Franz Josef Land, on
the eastern shores of Spitsbergen, and,
possibly, In the drift of the eastern side
of Greenland.'
"We placed some of these casks
aboard whalers which started north
before the Bear. Our Idea is to place
these casks en the Ice floes at different
points, covering 1 quite an expanse of
territory, and In this way we shall not
be apt to miss anything;."
One of the men who has been very
active in assisting Mr. Bryant in car
rying out the cask project is Professor
Angelo Heilprin. Speaking of the pro
ject and its possibilities, he said:
"Be far as the northeastern er North
American drift Is concerned, It is very
likely- that the casks, if gains; through
at all, will fellow the Una mere er less
closely which was the path of the
famous expedition of MeClare over
forty years ago, which solved the
northwest passage. "
"Again, with regard to the northwest
ern or Siberian drift, whioh would.
naturally be taken to be In the main)
coincident with . the line that was fol
lowed by the FraiH, it is proper ta say
that despite the absolutely positive
confirmation ef the existence of such a
current, which the successful voyage of
the Fram gave, there aro some even
to-day who look upon the drift of this
vessel as not being borne by a perma
nent current, bat by a combination ef
temporary enes. Chief Engineer Mel
ville himself has at various times ex
pressed a doubt upon the existence bf
such a permanent current, and it was
probably largely this doubt which in
fluenced him more particularly toward
the present exploration.
"In singular confirmation ef Mel
ville's views is the testimony which
has been recently published by the sec
ond officer of Nansen's expedition, whe
was on board the Fram during the
memorable drift, to the effect that in
his belief the current which bore the
Fram northwestward in such close
proximity to the pole was, contrary to
the opinion expressed by Nansen him
self, not a continuous one. but one ac
cidental and brought about by the con
currence of interacting, temporary and
local ones.
"In evidence of this he says that at
various periods of the drift hawsers
that were dropped from the stern of
the Fram, instead of following: in the
course of the boat, were drawn in
tension In the direction opposite to It,
showing that In those parts of the
water which were some distance from
the surface there as an oceanic cur
rent tending: In a direction contrary to
that which the Fram itself was making:.
"This view, which seems not. general
ly to be known, has recently been pub
lished as a brochure in Norwegian and
German, as a supplement to Nansen's
exploration, and In German as a sud
plement to his work. It carries also
the further information that the Frara
did not go through her Journey un
scathed, as Is also currently believed,
but with such Injuries to her as were
at one time considered to be almost
fatal to a further continuance of the

DR. JOHN DUNCAN QUACKENBOS of Columbia University has cured STEALING BY HYPNOTISM, IMMORALITY AND DRUNKEN
NESS BY HYPNOTISM, THE CIGARETTE HABIT BY HYPNOTISM.
Ever since the announcement was made a few days ago that this physician could overcome crime and vicious habit? thnuph sug
gestion his house and office have been In a state of siege. Day and night appeal haa been made at his door by those who insist that they
have no strength to resist thieving or strong drink. Young boys and little girls are brought to this man by unhappy father*- and mothers,
who have about lost hope seeing their sons and daughters weakening slowly into cigarette funds. But to one and all Dr. Quackenbos has
givn the cheering counsel that there is no crime or sin, no matter to what degree of viciousness the victim has fallen, but can be overcome by a
hypnotic sleep, when high moral alms are suggested to the patient's mind.
It was early In the winter Just passed that Dr. Quackenbos began his self-imposed task upon the young boys who lived In thd Newsboys'
Home. New*Yock. One or two of the little fellows at first rather timidly presented themselves to the doctor to be cured of the excessive use of
d were treated with such success by this physician that it was not long before dozens of these small chaps were urging the doctor to
enable them to do without the cigarettes which were shown to be Injurious to their strength and lives.
While petty stealing has been cured In many cases by Dr. Quackenbos since he began to use suggestion for the correction of crime among
Lthful "offenders, the case In which he takes the greatest pride and upon which he bases the theory that even an habitual criminal may be
reformed Is the case of a young fellc vho for five years had stolen right and left. He had been arrested, and was in a fair way to spend a part
of his life in the State reformatory, wnen his case was brought to the attention of the doctor.

three times. The rewards of honesty, moderation and devotion to em
ployers interests were then pictured, and the patient was told to wake
up at a designated time, feeling encouraged, ambitious and happy. These
suggestions are always fulfilled. A disgust for tobacco is produced; some
times so strong that after the first treatment the patient will almost en

twenty -two cigarettes a day, dropped to four a week after a single sitting.-

and then that he would not steal, each being repeated emphatically three
times. He was then told that he lived in a country where an honest boy
was sure to rise and an honorable career was suggested to him dependent
on his respect for the property of other people.
The final suggestion was to lay aside his hang-dog guilty look, to put

The sexual I'crvrsions that have been successfully treated are many.
Ungovernable abuses have been controlled and patients have been obliqued
from sexual manias which no appeal to self-respect, fear of physical or

effect on. Animal standards have been displaced from some boys' minds,
and intellectual, moral and spiritual ideals substituted therefor. The
thought of marriage with an honorable woman, who would be In sympathy

hypnotism. Boys addicted to the cigarette habit, to profanity and the

able through hypnotism. Stammerers may be relieved of their defect.
High resolve may be made to take the place of sordid and sensual aims,
lofty ideals of low standards, mental brilliancy and Interest of stupidity

The Santa Fe Railroad Company has
had four different sets of cowboys and
plains detectives each employed for a
month at a time in pursuing "Black
Jake" and hie gang on a dozen different
dews. Marshals of Arizona and New
Mexico have been equally vigilant, and
have been active in sending sagacious
peace officers of the plains to catch the
bandits, and the United States troops
have galloped here and there along -the
frontier in vain quests of "Black Jake"
and his followers. A reward of $5000 if
offered Jointly by the Executives of the
Territories for the capture of "Black
Jake" dead or alive, and even now a score
or two of men are searching over the
wild, dreary and uninhabited mountain
chain which stands on the border between
Mexico and the United States, in the hope
of earning the tempting reward offered
for the taxing of the outlaws.
The rlae of the notorious gang dates
from the early days of August, 1596.
"Black Jake" is the frontier name for a
former United States scout named Jacob
Emmona. He enlisted in the military ser
vice at Fort Whlpple, near Prescott,
Ariz., after he had been "a cowboy in the
Territories foe eleven years. He came
originally from the vicinity of Vineland,
N. J., and the cowboys and hin comrades
at the garrison say he had an unusual
education.
But he was a born tough. He shot and
killed a barkeeper at Willlamp, Ariz.,
when he was but 20, and narrowly es
caped hanging. As a scout he was a fail
ure, because no one had confidence In
him. He was left fISOO by a New Jersey
relative In ISS3, and when he got out of
the service he spent all the money In a
month in Phoenix and Yuma. Then he
drifted down to Sonora, Mexico, and the
few people who remembered him thought
he was probably dead down there until
the news came that he was th<=. head of a
reckless band of bamiits who were after
gold coin at the sacrifice of any life that
baffled their efforts.
On or about August 8, ISOi'., several men
employed In the general merchandise
â tore of the Hualapi Mining Company, two
miles north of Kinginan, Ariz., were
roused from their noonday siestas behind
the counters one hot, blistering day, by
four cowboys who walked in and asked
to see some saddles. One of the store
men started to go upstairs to show the
strangers his stock of saddles. The others
were too warm and sleepy to move, but
the moment they saw each of the suppos
ed purchasers whip out two long, mur
derous revolvers at full cock they were
Instantly very much awake.
When each of the store men looked Into
the muzzle of a pistol as if into the mouth
of a railroad tunnel, he knew that he and
his store companions were in the hands of
bandits. While one bandit, a tall, dark
complexioned fellow, with deep-set eyes
and mammoth tattooed st;irs on his hands,

transportable valuables, the store men
"HOW I WON SUCCESS AS AN AUTHOR."
The Stirring Story of Poor Frank Bullcn, Whose Talc of "The Cruise of the Cachalot" Mas
Just Brought Him pame and Fortune. Klpi'o9 Praised His Work-
I HAVE just received .rom a friend in
London some passages of autobiogra
phy lately communicated to him by
Frank T. Bullen. the author of "The
<ruise of the Cachalot." which so
many readers are now pronouncing
the most enthralling narrative of true
sea adventure that has ever rome into
t)i<ir bands. These passages indicate
that, if anybody wants to repeat Mr. Bul
lÂ°n's literary achievement In kind as well
as in measure, he will have' to begin early
in life- ; for Mr. Rullen's own career was
one unbroken succession of unusual ex
periencea from the moment of his birth
down to about his twenty-fifth year,
since when it has had a rather more nor
mal course.
"I was born in London In 1R57." he says,
"my father being a Journeyman stone
mason. My mother I never know, for
while I was an infant my parents sep
arated, leaving me, their only child, to
the mercy of my father's sister, a poor
dressmaker who never married. To her
tender care I am Indebted for seven
happy years."
Of his life with this aunt he adds: "Her

lay soundly sleeping til) 0. the bright
summer mornings were almost intermin

were kept looking at very close range into
the imizzlcs of cocked revolvers. In ten
minutes, perhaps, some $1400 in coin, was
taken, for there is not the convenience of
bank deposits in frontier settlements.
Then the storekeepers were bound and
gagged. One of them, John A. Bishop, re
sisted, and in the scrimmage was stabbed
to death. The bandits bound the other
men tighter, nnd, hastening; out, wore
poon on their broncos outside. Before
any of the men in the store could get
loose and give the alarm the bandits were
miles away on the alkali desert, where no
one but a few poor starved Hualapl In
dians live in a territory of about 700
square miles.
The Sheriff ' had no sooner set out to
seek the bandits than the information
came that the office force of the Resolute
Mining a Company, fifty miles over toward
Ash Fork, had been held up, bound and
gagged by the same gang on the day pre
vious to the robbery and murder at King
man. Some ' thirty ounces of gold and
coin to the amount of $100 had been stolen
from the safe. v.;-'. -
In the latter, part of the following
month "Black Jake" and his gang robbed
the bank at the rich cattle and mining
town of Nogales, Arts. It was a very
bold deed. Three entered the bank. One
covered the president, who was outside
the railing; another stepped to the win
dow and called the teller, who was sitting
at some distance, and ordered him to hold
up his hands., The teller promptly obeyed,
and started to walk to the window, but
was stopped . before , he . could get there. .
The third man went down to the end of
the railing to get behind it and at the
cash. At the end he saw an open door
leading Into a room Where several men
were planning an irrigation scheme. He
promptly held them up. Each man was
thus. busy holding some person with his
six-shooter,, and there was no onÂ© left to
shovel the money into. the bag.
Realizing that something must be done
to change the combination, the man who
had the irrigation convention at bay
promptly shut the door on It. The slam
ming of the door attracted the attention
of the gentleman at the teller's window,
and he turned to see what the trouble
was. The Instant the robber turned the
teller made a Jump for his window, under- ,
neath which, on a shelf, reposed the bank
six-shooter, which he grabbed and began
shooting.
Over 100 shots were fired Inside of three
minutes. Every man who could get a gun
and a horse took the trail. A skirmish

Animas Canyon. "Black Jake" lost his
horse, but got the one ridden by the
Sheriff of Pima County, and escaped into
Sonora, Mexico.
Three months passed and the Arizona
people began to hope and then to think
that the Black Jake band had decided to
remain permanently In the republic of
Mexico. Late one night in January, 1897,

like a drifting ship out of the peaceful
haven of my aunt's home. Education,
love and sympathy all disappeared. In
their place came hunger, blows, severe
exhausting labor from 6 In the morning
till 11 at night, and an atmosphere of vile
language. At last, when I was In my
twelfth year, after an experience of life
in London that would fÃound Incredible if
it were detailed, I escaped to sea as cabin
boy In an old tub of a bark bound to
Pemarara."
From this followed ten or twelve yearn
of almost constant seafaring, marked for
the most part by nothing but hardships
and dangers. At 22, with an all but
empty purse and nothing better in pros

to find employment on land. "But things

New Mexico. While four of the masked
men covered the/ eleven gamblers and
kept their hand? away above their heads,
the tallest of the masked men gave his
whole attention to the cashier of the lay
out. That official reached for his pistol,
but he was too slow. He was shot in the
face and he dropped forward on the green
table. The robbers were gone in a twink
ling.
Three murders were added in 1898 to the
catalogue of crimes attributed to the no
torious band. One was the shooting of a
passenger on the stags from Tombstone
to Grant Springs, In Arizona, when that
vehicle was held up, and the passengers
piled their watches, purses and other
valuables In a heap for the use of the
bandits. Another murder was that of a
switchman for the Atlantic and Pacific
Railroad Company at NaPmjo, because,
probably, he was suspected of having
recognized the gang and of having plans
for telling his suspicions to the Sheriff.
The Santa Fe west-bound overland was
held up by the gang west of Gallup last
June. The express messenger was shot,
the safe was dynamited, and a sack of
gold and currency was secured. Sheriff
Lawrence and twenty carefully picked
men chased the gang for two weeks.

clew remained for trailing the outlaws

soil In an uninhabited region. The gen

November while two employes there were

Others are living on exposed ranches,
where the robbers can come in, if they
are revengeful, and kill the man who haa

"This fa-ct Ftniek us as somewhat cu

coincidence."
How to Make Gold From Silver.
And how does a man go to work to turn
silver into gold? Of course, it is more or
less a seere/t, btit the genial inventor
kindly volunteers many tips in that direc
tion.
i i"i way to increase the small amount
of gold already in a ivlcxican silver dollar
is to hammer tho coin at a low tempera
tureâas far below zero as you can freeze
it.
On this point Dr. Kmmens writes In the
Anglo-American Matrazine:
"Let us consider fir a moment what
cold and impact mean from a molecular
point of view. To abstract heat causes
matter to contract, or. in other words, to
become of greater specific gravity. To
hammer a piece of metal causes its mole
< ules to approach closer and. for ausht
we know, to pulverize each other.
"We are, moreover, aware that parti
cUs of matter which adhere together
very slightly may by vÂ» Infinitesimal ad
ditionaJ convergence become so closely co
herent thai an extraordinary .legree of
force is required to subsequently tear
them apart. The [process of welding is a
case in point.
Sort of Cold Welding Process.
"I, ay two pieces of redhot iron in con
tact and you can separate them with the
utmost ease; strike them while In con
tact and they form one rolid body. Sure
ly, then, it is conceivable that an aggre
gate of any silver molecules exposed to
cold and impact may be partly resolved
Into urstoff. which in turn becomes weld
ed into molecules differing In structure
and specific gravity from the original sil
ver.
"Such a result is more than conceivable:
It Is probable. Instead of being surprised
at Sir William Crookes being so simple as
to try to make gold, our wonder should
rather be that the *na;iy eminent chem
ists of the present century have been so
simple as to overlook the argentaurum
method of molecular disaggregation and
rearrangement.
"Here, however, an objection at once
presents itself. Why gold? Admit that
the silver molecules become pulverized,
and that the fragments become welded
Into fresh molecules, it is unlikely that
these will be all of one kind.
"Why should not copper, iron and other
substance* be produced instead of gold?
The answer is twofold. In the first place,
the contractive action of cold will prob
ably prevent the formation of molecules
having a less specific gravity than silver.
"In the second place. Sir William's ex
periment showed that very few of the
rearranged molecules took the form of
gold. If my worthy friend had com
menced by making a complete analysis of
his Mexican dollar, and had subsequently
made a complete analysis of the ham
mered and frozen cuttings, he would have
found many changes in addition to the
augmented percentage of gold."
Here is what Dr. Emmens says of his
latest improved process:
"The gold producing work In our ar
gentaurum laboratory is a case of sheer
Mammon dealing.
"It is not being carried on for the sake
of science, or in a proselyting spirit. No
disciples are desired and no believers are
asked for.
"Our gold process has become modified
since the announcements made last. When
work on a microscopical scale advanced
to commercial dimensions it was found
possible to dispense with the tedious and
costly preparation of so-called 'allo
tropic* silver as raw material. We now
use Mexican dollars, and the operation
consists of five stages,. as follows:
"(a) Mechanical treatment. . }
"<!>) Fluxing and granulation!!
"(c) Mechanical treatment.
"(d) Treatment with oxides of nitrogen
â i. c., a modified nitric acid.
"(e) Refining.
"We regard the mechanical treatment
as the causa causans. The fluxing and
granulation serve, we think, merely to
render the molecular aggregates suscep
tible of displacement and rearrangement.
"If you will try the combined effect of
Impact and very low temperature you can
easily produce some gold.
"1 don't promise that you will make It
at a commercial profit, but I doubt not
you will be well pleased to produce it at
all. irrespective of cost.
"Take a Mexican dollar, a coin which,
as now minted, is certified by the United
States Assay Office here to be free from
STOCKTON'S FAMOUS BACHELORS CLUB
THE young men of the Naomi Bach
elor riub of Stockton have demon
strated that there can be at least
a degree of assimilation between
domesticity and bohemianism.
While enjoying all the' freedom of
the man-about-town they have also man
aged to provide for themselves many of
the comforts of a home. The club has
become one of the fixtures of Stockton.
But the wise young marriageable
women of Stockton declare most emphat
ically that it won't live long. They have
Joined hearts and hands to disrupt it, and
the married women are with them. With
such a combination against them the
chances of bachelorhood and club life
seem to be wholly against the members
of this Stockton club.
The bachelors' club was formed over
two years ago by the ten young men,
with a view of combining social pleasures
with hotter living comforts than they
could obtain in boarding-houses. The
charter members of the organization were
Harry H. Hewlett, with the Thirst Na
tional Bank; J. A. Edwards, with Hale
& Co.: Horace Vincent, of the Savings
and T>oan Society; A. T. Baum, A. P. op
erator; A. H. Harlin, advertising solic
itor; W. H. Harrison, photographer; E.
H. Oharrette. druggist; R. W. Elsom, pos
tal '-lerk; H. J. I^ewis, merchant, and J.
J. Campbell, musician.
A "comfortable place to roost, good
grub and plenty of latch-keys" is one way
of summing up the desires of the young
men. They made no vows against women,
drew no iron-clad rules for the operation
of their club, and while never overstep
ping the bounds of good form, the dining
room has been the scene of some merry
gatherings. The members figured out
how much the per capita cost would he
to run the establishment, the assessments
were agreed to, and the handsome Berg
mann house on San Joaquln street se
cured for the club. A man to act as
chambermaid wns secured, and a Japan
ese cook Installed In the culinary depart
ment.
The members learned early the trials
and tribulations to be encountered In the
management of servants. They finally
solved the problem by getting Japs in
their "raw state" and taking them
jroldâ c. f not to have more than a traceâ
and dispose It in an apparatus which will
prevent expansion or flow.
"Then subject it to heavy, rapid and
continuous beatings under conditions of
cold such as to prevent even a temporary
rise of temperature when the blows are
struck. Test, the material from hour to
hour, and at length you will find more
than a trace of gold.
"Whether, the experiment would prove
successful with pure silver or a silver
alloy other than a Mexican dollar I can
not say. It is to my mind very possible
that there are. several varieties of silver
considered with regard to their molecular
equilibrium.
"I do not even Insist that the metal .
obtained In the experiment or produced
under better economical conditions in the
Argentaurum laboratory is gold. I choose
to call it so, but this is not binding on
you or any one else."
Is It a Golden Keely Secret
It is claimed that Dr. Emmens has pre
sented a problem even more difficult to
solve than the Keely, motor. In the first
place, he is in absolute control of hin
secrets and laboratory. He is a man of
prepossessing appearance and manner, his
"dome of thought" Is Shakespearian, his
countenance pleasing and his language
pimple and well expressed and his delivery
forcible, magnetic and exceedingly plausi
ble.
He has scientific terms and data at his
fingers' ends. The learned gentlemen in the
Assay Office arlmit that his claims cannot
be controverted beyond answer.
He sits at his desk, on the seventh floor
of a big, . many windowed building on
Broadway, looking down on Bowling
Green and the business center of New
York beyond. He answers questions In
stantly and reassuringly..
He says the subject of transmuting sil
ver into gold is too serious to be consid
ered in a frivolous way so often exhibited
by newspaper- writers. His figures are
modest and he keeps his statements with
in reasonable bounds., if his claim is to
be admitted as ' possible.
He says: "We are unable to manufac
ture gold in large quantities at present.
To do so would require numerous and ex
tensive duplications of our limited appli
ances, which can handle but a few ounces
of silver at a time. The present profit is
about 30 per cent. It has required a great
deal of thought and hard, exacting toil
to bring the process to its present state of
development. Really, we are but oh the
threshold of manufacturing gold on a
almost unlimited â scale. I estimate
that we have made about $15,000 worth of
gold from silver thus far.

dub's ideas of what arc ideal servant
should be. The larder and sideboard were
stocked with the best the market afford
ed* and an tnvitation to dine with the
bachelors soon became a coveted pleas
ure.
A year ago the club Increased its mem
bership and secured more spacious Quar

in the elite residence quarter of the city.
By good business management the bach
elors have never hud any trouble with

Raymond M. Laughton. who was with
the Oregon at Santiago, is one of the new
members. Four of those who have been
members have, with the aid of brides,
"gone to housekeeping for themselves."
The club motto is "Enjoy yourself while
you are single." and frequently some of
the benedicts drop in to spend an even

new member comes in he may be sure
that he is welcome, as a single vote
against granting his application for mem

: which has been my belief since forty

"This seems to me a perfectly straight

In this organization of convivial spirits
fire many young men who have or will
distinguish themselves in business, art
and the professions.
The entertainments given by the club
are always on an elaborate scale, and
there is no lack of beauty to grace surh
occasions. The success of this club nat

men of other cities do not effect similar
organizations. Such an association gives
an opportunity for the members to enter
tain their friends, secure the best of liv

dreaded "boarding-house hash."

INGENIOUS TRICKS OF CARD SHARPS.
IT Is not very remarkable that con
firmed gamesters should stoop to
fraud as a means of enhancing their
chances of winning, says Pearson's
Weekly; but It Is remarkable that
other gamesters should bo so blind
to the devices Invented by more ingenious
fellows, and fortunes have been won by
clever sharpers, from nxen and women
who have been well alive to their own
interests and not wanting In cunning sus
picion, by clever contrivances of their
own construction. It is not often that a
gambler is sufficiently enterprising and
moan as to have a cardroom specially
constructed to facilitate his fleecing his
â¢victims and visitors; but to even this
length went a man, now deceased, who,
despite his vast private fortune, syste
matically preyed upon the pockets of his
wealthy acquaintances.
The room was constructed so small that
only a sufficient space was allowed for a
square table and the chairs of four play
ere, the object of this being to prevent
onlookers or any one standing behind the
particular chair which the host always
took.
The room was magnificently decorated,
and hidden In the deeply carved black oak
paneling were two spy holes, from which
a person on the other side of the wall
could see every card of the person sitting
opposite the host. When cards were being
played a confederate of the host was al
ways watching, unseen, from these holes,
having his finger upon an electric button.
This button communicated with a large
button hidden under the carpet just In
front of the host's chair, and by this
means the confederate was able to com
municate to his master what cards were
hi the hand of his tete-a-tete player.
Sitiinp down In his chair, the arch
pcoundrol put his toe on the Invisible but

frightened ghosts v/ere materialized, the
stories of which kept the superstitious
people of Paris indoors on dark nights.
The cellars of the old house are dank
and noi.Â«om<\ and there are several large
holes In the floor that remind one of
oubliettes. The courtyard has a morose
and solemn aapect. At one end, under a
flagged porch, there is a stone staircase,
worn by time. It does not require a
vivid imagination to fancy the hosts of
beautiful women who walked up those

the promises of the old wonder-worker.
And up thfse stops walked the pompous
Cardinal de Rohan to discourse with
Count Cagllostro on such subjects as
necromancy, metallurgy, cabala and
oneirocritic, which constituted the
four elementary divisions of the
great Cophta's art. Cagliostro'a
career in France was a flamboyant
one, and for a time all Paris flocked to
his soirees and seances. He was as prodi-
hearts, two clubs, three diamonds, and
four spades. It wm the confederate's
duty to first wire what was the strongest
suit In the "hand" before him. Thus,
one push of the button Informed the arch
thief that his tete-a-tete's strongest suit
was hearts, and so on. When It had been
communicated how the suits stood in
strength, it was the confederate's duty
to wire what the cards were, starting
with the highest In the highest suit and
going to the lowest in the lowest. So
quickly could this scheme be worked that
very often the host knew his tete-a-tete's
cards before the latter had properly ar
ranged his "hand."
After the strength of the suits had been
communicated In this way the host feit
twelve rapid taps on the sole of his shoe,
and he knew this meant the queen of
hearts. A Hhort pause, and then ten rapid
taps told him the next highest card was
the ten of hearts. And so on. It is said
that, thanks to this ingenious scheme,
which was never discovered during the in

A somewhat similar, but less success

which a certain Continental dressmaker
was detected. This woman, like many
others of her calling, made it a custom
to entertain her customers at gambling
in the secrecy of her private apartments,
and she probably found it infinitely more
lucrative than her professed trade, to
which it attracted customers. Her plan
was to stand her husband outside the

The life of Count Cagliostro makes fas
cinating reading, and Thomas Carlyle re
morselessly dissected his character In that
remarkable essay, "Count Cagllostro,"
which is so. Carlylrsrjue and consequently
not entirely accurate. Joseph Ralsamo
was the Count's real name, btÂ»t it did not
pound mysterious enough when ho became
more than an amateur sorcerer, so he
chose a high-sounding title, just as the
fortune tellers, clairvoyants and mediums
of our own day change the name of
Thomas Smith or Maria Jones to Slgnor
Patzulosi and Mme. Zella. Human nature
has not changed so materially In 150 years,
and people still believe in witchcraft and
sorcery, and young fdrls give up hard
earned savings for amulets and love po
tions. People laugh at the pretensions of
eighteenth century soothsayers, forget
ting that never in the history of the world
did empiricism thrive as it doea at the
present time.
lialsamo was born of a merchant fam
ily in Palermo, Sicily, In 1743. He received
the rudiments of an education, and be
ing naturally hright he made good use
of all his learning. He was such an apt
student of chemistry that he was sent to
a monastery near Palermo to pursue the
study under the direction of learned
priests. It was an age of Ignorance and
PiiperÃtition. and the- acdle mind of Ral
samo detected great possibilities in per
forming tricks based on this science. He
was naturally a trickster, and so, after
completing his course of study, he started
out on a career of deception. He began
omined the cards of the unsuspecting
players, and, opening a small trap In the
wall, exhibited similar cards drawn from
a pack he carried. Owing to the light,
which was thrown down upon the table
and Into the faces of all players but the
dressmaker, the exhibited cards could be
seen by her only. Her eyes, shaded from
the glare of the lamp, were accustomed to
the dim light In which the cards were
exhibited, but to the other players, glano
iiiK from the glare, such dimness would
have been as impenetrable us t:.r- dark
ness of niKht. In this way fchÂ« man was
nble to show his wife exactly what cards
were in tho "hand" of the player behind
whom he stood, and when one hand had
been disclosed in this manner he moved
on to the next.
But it was too clumsy to bÂ« entirely
successful; victims became suspiclpus of
the dressmaker's extraordinary runs of
luck and her habit of constantly looking
up at the walls, and one day a victim
contrived, during her host's absence, to
fix the gas shade to suit her own eyes,
and during the game followed the schem
er's eyes the moment she saw them rise.
Then the dressmaker vanished.
Many attempts have been made to in
vent a system of ornamenting the backs
of cards in such a way that a person
knowing the secret can read them. But
the difficulties in the way are manifest,
and gamblers who have attempted such
frauds have generally beÂ£n speedily de
tected.
It Is a pretty well known fact, however,
that a 1 notorious American "crook," who)
died In jail not long ago, was successful]

rano of a Bum of money. Balsamo pre
tended that a secret treasure lay burled
In a certain rocky chasm just outside the
city of Palermo, and that he, for a con-
sideration â of courseâ was able to unearth
the gold by means of certain magical In
cantations. The goldbeater was a sim
ple man, and like a grudgeon swallowed
the bait, hook and all. He paid the re
quired fee. and accompanied by the ama
teur sorcerer paid a visit on a certain
dark night to the lonely spot where the
treasure was supposed to be.
The necromancer drew a magic clrolft
of phosphorus on the ground, pronounced
Borne cabalistic words and bade the gold
smith to dig. Marano went to work with
pick and spade. Suddenly terrific yella
were heard, and a troop of devils (Jo
seph's boon companions in disguise)
rushed from behind the rocks und pounc
ed upon thÂ© hapless goldsmith. They
pummeled him with their flats and prod
ded him with pitchforks, and left him in-
BÂ«nÃible among the rocks. For this act
Baleamo was forced to flee from Palermo
to escape the vengeance of the furious
goldsmith and punishment at the hands
of the authorities. He was not loath to
leave thÂ« city, for he had the heart of a
rover.
In company with a Gree-k named Al
thotas he visited Greece, Egypt, Arabia,
Persia, Rhodes, Malta, Naples, Venice
and Rome. According to his own account,
he studied alchemy at Malta in the lab
oratory of Pinto, grand master of the
Knights of Malta and Bt. John. During
the course of his wanderings he became

The new Park Row building In New
York is undeniably the tallest office
building in the world, and with very
few exceptions the tallest work of
human hands to be found anywhere
on the earth's surface. A passing glance
at the sky line of T^ower Manhattan
chows how de.cidedly it towers above its
near neighbors and closest competitorsâ¢

high, and the American Surety building,
rising 312 feet above the street. The Man

long time the highest In the city, is.

summit of the new building. How long
the I'ark row building will enjoy Its pres
ent pre-eminence is, of course. Impossible
to Bay. Th-- very conditions that have
made it ma\ cause it to be excelled within
the next few \ears.
To begin with, its height from the side
walk to the tops of the cupolas on. the
towers is 890 feet. Thus it is over 100 feet
taller than the dome of the Capitol at
Washington. So feet above the ex
treme height of the Pyramids. Even
these figures do not represent its
full proportions. The flagpoles on top
of the building are 57 feet In height. The
foundations i rtend 54 feet below the sur
face. Therefore, from the base of its
foundations to the top of Its flagpoles the
new building spans 501 feet How fcreat
this distance la one may realize by Pa
fleeting that it is equal to thn length of
two city blocks or by measuring on, the

more and more versed In natural magic,
and his talents In that line, were so great
that he soon won a reputation as a mas
ter of miracles. He perfected his dex
terity and became proficient In tricks in
volving the use of sleight of hand. He
also learned the art of forging documents
and seals, and practiced with zeal the
profession of the Idea of "mine and
thine."
In Rome he met a beautiful girl, Im
renza Feliciani, daughter of a girdle
maker, and a<? she was dexterous in the
practice of sly arts and promised to be a
good assistant to him and helpmate, they
wore married. She was, In fact, more
original and inventive than himself, and
they traveled over Europe in a eoaeh-in
four with a retinue of servants in gor
geous liveries. He played the part of a
magician, prophet and exorcist so well
that his fame spread over Europe and peo
ple of the better elites, scholars and writ
ers, met him with great deference. The
ladle* wore fans, hats and souvenirs a la
ragiiostro; his wife"s picture and his own
were worn in lockets. Marble busts of
the couple were to be seen in the parks
and palaces, and under the picture of the
charlatan were inscribed the words, "The
Divine Cagliostro."
One of his famous arts was the prepar
ation of a reiuvenating tincture, by
whoso use old and wrinkled ladies might
obtain a smooth skin and the various
charms of youth. ''At Strasburg," says
one of his biographers, "he reaped an
abundant harvest by professing the art
of making old people young." Cagllostro
himself pretended to be of great age, and
declared that he had hobnoubed with Al
While there are a few structures that
exceed the new building In vertical dimen
sion. It is by all odds the tallest lnhahlted
building in the world. The restaurant on
top of the main building is 208 feet above
the street, while the topmost offices, largo,
i r table rooms, are 84 feet In the air.
Their windows command a view of over
forty miles. The two lofty tuwers of the
building may Ik.- si en from nearly the.
entire distance across the State of New
Jersey.
The new building h::s a frontage of 193
fVet on the street winch it faces, of 2Z
fi-t mi a aide streel and of 17 feet on a
rear alley. It n:;iy therefore he said to
look in three directions, it is nearly four
times us high as its main frontage. The
difficulty presented by that proportion is
an architectural problem of some magni
tude In itself.
The lot on which the building stands
contains l"," 1 "* square feet. Considering
this fact and the great height of the
structure, it netil not be said that a vast
amount of steol and stone and other
material enters into Its construction. As
a matter of feet, it weighs about 20,000
tons. If all the. material were loaded
upon heavy street trucks it would require
;i procession of teams and wagona nearly
three miles long to oonvey it. It would
build all the houses of an ordinary subur
ban town, with enough left over to con
struct a good Bizi d church.
It may surprise those who are not fa
miliar with the art of modern construc
tion to know that this towering Btruo-.
exsrder and Julius Caesar; that he was
present at the burning of Rome under
Nero, and was an eye-witness of the
crucifixion of Christ. As the founder of
a certain mysterious lodge Cagliostro
gained many adherents. He led his
brotherhood back to Enoch and Ellas,
and promised the members that they
should be born again, morally and physi
cally, and In that way they could live
5000 years.
Count Cagliostrif was at the perihelion
of his fame when he first appeared in
Paris, In the summer of 1781. His record
had preceded him, and all Paris was on
the qul vive. Cardinal de Rohan of
France, who was a firm believer in the
pretensions of the charlatan, entertained
him in Paris, introducing him to that gay
world of the old regime which went out
forever in the French Revolution. He cap
tured Paris as easily as ho had the other
capitals on the Continent, and he literally
coined money.
Imbert Sainte-Armand, the author of
"Marie Antoinette and the End of the Old
Regime," say?: "The mania for the
Evpernatural, the rage of the marvelous,
prevailed In the last years of the eigh
teenth century, which had wantonly de
rided every sacred thing. Never were the
Roslcruciana, the adopts, the sorcerers
and prophets bo numerous and respected.
Serious and educated men, magistrates,
courtiers, declared themselves eye-wit
nesses of alleged miracles."
When Cagllostro came to France he
found the ground prepared for his magl
<al operations. A society eager for dis
tractions and emotions, indulged to every
firm of extravagance, necessarily wel
r
ture, with all Its welrht, rests upon a
foundation of land. It Is as secure, bow
ever, an though Its base rested upon the
most solid rock. In fact, a foundation
equal if not superior to rock was made
for it.
This was done by driving timber* a
foot in diameter and forty feet long Into
the sandy boII which forms the site of
the building by means of a twenty-ton
pile driver. These piles are in rowÃ two
fÂ°et apart and sixteen inches from cen
ter to center under the vertical columns
which support the structure. There are
some 12.000 of them under the whole build
ing. Several acres of Georgia timber land
â KPre denuded to furnish the foundations
almie of this big building.
The piles were driven Into the gTound
as far as they would go linger the blows
of the twenty-ton pile driver. They are
thus prepared to sustain a weight of
twenty tons. As the most that will be
put upon them Is about seven tons it
will be seen that they form a tolerably
bi cure foundation. Moreover, they are
below the water line, so that they are
indestructible by the ordinary process of
decay.
"When the piles were driven in their fun
length the sand was cleared away for a
foot down around their tops and concrete
was poured about them, forming a solid
rock surface, resting securely upon their
caps. On this concrete base were laid
large blocks of granite and above them
the brick piers of the building.
Tho weight of the building 1Â» not al-
corned euch a man and hailed him as It 3
guide. "Whence did he come? What was
his country, his age, his origin? Where
did he get those extraordinary diamonds
which adorned his dress, the gold which
he squandered bo freely?" It was all a
mystery. So far as was known, Cag-Ilostro
had no resources, no letter of < rer'it, and
yet he lived In luxury. He treated and
cured the poor without pay, and not satis
fied with restoring tuem to health he
irade them large presents of money. The
Germans, who lived on legends, imagined
that he was the Wandering Jew. Speak
ing a Btrange gibberish, which was
neither French nor Italian, with which he
mingled a jargon which he did not trans
late but called Arabic, he used to recite
with solemn emphasis the most absurd
fables, and he. found the people ready to
listen and beltev* him.
The Count dressed In a manner that be
flted his calling. According- to the most
authentic records he was rather a badly
built man, clad in poorly cut blue taffeta,
laced on the borders. He wore his hair In
a startling and most ridiculous style, with
powdered plaits bunched in cadencttep.
His silk stockings were embroidered in
gold and the buckles of his velvet Bhoes
sparkled with precious stones. The dis
play of diamonds on his fingers and watcn
chains went beyond the line of vulgarity.
His headdress was a pointed hat orna
mented with white plumes. During eight
months of the year he wore a great blue
fox cloak. On the street he was a walk-
Ing scarecrow and the children fled from
him In terror. His features were regular,
his complexion clear, his teeth superb and
his eyes were of marvelous brilliancy.
Hia wife was a woman of bewildering
beauty, realizing the Greek lines In all
their antique purity and enhanced by an
Italian expression. Duals were fought
betwe*n gallants over the color of her
eyes and the dimple in her chin.
It wu the Cardinal de Rohan himself
who Installed Cagliostro and his wife in
the home of Hme. d'Orvilllers, and which
is now to be torn down. He used to visit
the sorcerer almost every day, arriving at
dinnertime and remaining until late In
the night. It was bald that the
great Cardinal assisted Cagliostro In his
labors, and the people of that time spoke
of the mysterious laboratory where gold
bubbled and diamonds sparkled In cruci
bles brought to a white beat.
The Queen of France bad a strange an
tipathy toward the charlatan, and It was
forbidden to mention his name In her
presence or at court. The wife of the
Comte de la Motte, an adventuress of the
first rank, boasted of her ability to con
quer the Queen's dislike. Bhe first made
the acquaintance of Lorenza and after
ward that of Cagliostro, who introduced
her to the Cardinal. Then followed tha
well-known Intrigue of the diamond neck
lace. The Cardinal, the "woman La
Motte" and Cagllostro was Imprisoned In
the Bastile. Here is the Count's own
statement of the affair:
"On the 22d of August a comrnissalre
and eight policemen entered my house.
The pillage began in my presence. They
compelled me to open my secretary.
Elixirs, balms and precious liquors all be
came the prey of the offlceru who came
to arrest me. I begged the comxnissaire
to permit me to use my carriage. Ho re
fused. The agent took me by the collar.
He had pistols, the stocks of which ap
peared from the pockets of his coat. They
hustled me into the street and scandal
ously dragged me along the boulevard to
the Rue Notre-Dame-de-Naaiareth. There
a carriage approached, which I waa per
mitted to enter to take me to the Bas
tile."
While in the Bastile Cagliostro made
the remarkable prediction that one day
the Bastile would be razed to the ground.
How well that prophecy was realized his
tory relates. AJfter ten months' imprison
ment the necromancer was released and
he received a triumphant welcome home.
Ten thousand people crowded the boule
vard near his house. They cheered him,
kissed his hands and carried him on their
shoulders.
But his triumph did not last long. An
order was Issued by the King command
ing the Count Cagiloetro to leave Paris in
twenty-four hours and France before the
end of two weeks. He bowed to the man
date of the sovereign and with his wife
visited BwlUerland and afterward Eng
land, but he had little success.
In 1789 he went to Rome, where he en
deavored to found one of his Egyptian
lodges, but the Holy Inquisition pro
nounced him guilty of Freemasonryâ a
particularly heinous offense in papal ter
ritory â and condemned him to death. The
sentence, however, waa commuted by the
Pope to perpetual Imprisonment in the
gloomy fortress of San Leon, Urbino.
The manner of his death and the day of
it are uncertain, but most authorities
agree that be died on August 28, 1795, from
apoplexy.
His wife, the beautiful Ix>renza Fell
danl, ended her days in a convent.
For eighteen years after Cagliostro had
closed the doors of his laboratories in his
Parisian home the old place waa undis
turbed.
It was not until 1805 that the doors were
opened, for the purpose of auctioning off
the furniture and rare belongings of the
Count. Slrfce then the gloomy house has
had no history, and now it, too, will pass
away.
lowed to comÂ© directly upon the granite
capstones which surmount these piers.
Instead, It is distributed by the system
of steel girders which is familiar to all
engineers. These girders are from eight
to 47 feet In depth. They are in effect
big bridges placed between the founda
tions and the footings of the vertical
columns of the building to carry the
weight evenly. The heaviest of these,
beneath one wall of the building, weighs
over fifty-two tons.
Above the eurface the method of con
structing the building has been the one
that must be tolerably familiar to all res
idents of the larger cities who havo
seen tall buildings in process of erection.
It consists of a steel framework, bulit
span above epan as ia done in the build
ing of a cantilever bridge. The walls
are merely the Bheathlng for this skele
ton structure.
It 1b interesting to turn from the con
sideration of the vast proportions of the
building Itself to the human Interests
that It will serve. It was to accommo
date the constant demand for more room
in the busiest section of the metropolis
that this expenditure of time, money
and effort, amounting altogether to Home
$2,400,000, was made. And the addition
which It makes In this direction is by no
means insignificant.
There are 950 rooms In the building on
the twenty-nine floors. Counting four
persons to each office this will make the
permanent popualtlon of the building
nearly 400 | i, or equal to that of many a
flourishing county seat.
To this must be added a large tran
sient population amounting probably for
one person to each resident at any given
time during business hours. This would
make an ordinary population, resident
and floating, of 7500 for this one building!
If 20 persona visit each office during the
day we have the result of 25,000 persona
using the building every day. In other
â¢words, an army as large as that of the
T'nited States will march in and out of
the building every day. The various ele
vators will bave daily pa^sons;er traffic
of over 60,000, or more than that of many
an important railway line.

some years after that before I began to
think it was something to develop into
many. But it is not so pen^rally known
that the making of them is very largely
a cottage and not a factory industry.
The cheaper ones come almost entirely
from the agricultural districts of Coburg,
the peasants tilling up their intervals of
fli 1.1 work with dollmaking, the dolls
being collected at regular intervals by
n. busings?. Then another author came
to me and asked me to sell a hook for
him, and I gradually went on until at
the present time the business has become
so extensive as to include the handling
of the work of the most prominent writers
in Knpland. I think it was in 1579 that
Wilkie Collins came to mo and asked me
to dippoSe of his hnoks for him. For ten
years we worked together in this way,
and upon his death, in IRS9, I was ap

tremendous advantage."
To-day Mr. Watt has among his clients
Kipling, Anthony Hope, Conan Doyle,

short, about every well-known writer
of stories in England, as well as promi
nent writers of other kinds. With these
men, publishers and editors in England
or in this country have now no direct
business dealings; such dealings are all
conducted through the agent. And all
that this means is not obvious at first
view. One thing it means is that the
leading writers of England are in what is
practically a sort of "trust;" their
affairs being so largely under the man
tlip factors -who trade in and export them.

â with a view to the advantage of all. It
hns meant gradually increasing- prices to
Hi" authors; and It has meant, and means,
the opportunity to sell their product more
"cleanly." so to say. than ever before.
As to this latter advantage, even such
men ns those I have named have their
lapses, and produce '.hings that editors
and publishers. If they could always have
a free choice, would certainly leave on
the author's hands. 3'he literary agent.
In the control he has of the market, and
his business shrewdnessâ his "clearance
s;ilos" senseâ saves the author of good
commercial najne almost entirely from
this form of loss. It would be an inter
esting story If one could tell of the work
by men of big names that American edi
tors and publishers nave bought in Eng
land at a pretty good price, and not
known quite how to use when they get It.
Ultimately such work gets published In
one form or another, but often not until
It has been sniffed at and sworn at or
groaned over for months, and may be for
j i nr*, ;is it came into x-iew on the editor's
or publisher's manuscript file.
But what- promises to be the most far
reaching effect of the authors' agent Is
one. that is at present only just coming
into view/ I have said that the business
dealings are now with the agent, and not
with the authors. As yet this has not re
sulted in a dissolution of the old ties b-.
tween author and publisher. It is still
"good business" for publishers to be in
close personal relations with authors, and
authors with publishers; and an impor
tant part of the good will of a periodical
or a publishing house is still its acquaint
ance with the leading authors. And prob
ably this will never cease to be the case,
in considerable measure. But any. one can
see that the growth of the authors' agent
must. tend finally to make*it less the case.
Already any one in this country who has
the money to pay for it can get a story
or novel from a well-known English
â¢writer. He needs no "connections," no
special reputation as a publisher. And
this is likely to become more and more
the "condition of the market" as time
goes on. As yet, however. It la only in
placing the work of English writers that
the authors' agent hap had any --->ally de
cisive effect. The better known American
writers still do their business direct with
the editor or publisher, in the old way.
Bui there are unmistakable signs of 3
change.

that she is engaged to be mar

love with another.
She has not seen the man she
loves for several years. He left her with
no avowal of affection, but she believed
he cared for her and had been estranged
by some circumstance or person un
known to her. She says:
) "After three years I wrote, but received
no reply. Since that time I can safely
say that he has not been out of my
thoughts for one whole hour at a single
time. My every desire, every thought,
has been associated with him. I love
him with a deep, pure love, and I am so
afraid I shall never be happy if I marry
the gentleman to whom I am engaged.

any reasonable advance if necessary if I
thought 1 would not be repulsed or ig

immediate success. Within a few weeks

th~ announcement made by the pas
tor of a suburban church in a small
Western city one Sunday early in
the winter of ISS6-97. Little did he th.ir.k
as he made the announcement that with
in a comparatively short time the news
boys on the streets of London would be
crying the same story along, with their
daily papers, and that the people of two
continents would be discussing it. Tet
that is the history of "In His Steps." a
&ook which has had a sale unparalleled
in the history of literature â three million
copies in the first four months of I>Â£<9-
The Story of -'In His Steps."
"Ir. His Steps"' deals with serious prob
lems. The city of Raymond is typical;
the leading church, with its ease-loving
and fashionable members, is common to
every community; and the pastor. Henry
Maxwell, is a good representative of his
profession. Any congregation would have
been disturbed by the circumstance which
is the basis of the problems in the narra
tive. Henry Maxwell has just completed
a vigorous sermon on Christian duty
when a poorly ciad and Hl-appearing
young man walks out before the audi
ence and begs for a chance to speak. He
is worn out in his search for work, and,
nncomplainingly. wonders what Christ
would do in similar circumstances. The
Etrange incident changes the pastor's con
ception of duty, and the next Sunday he
ask? all who are willing to join him in
making it a rule to ask before every ac
tion the question, "What would Jesus
do?"

been made aware of the difficulty of her
wonderful performance, and. echoed â  the
admiration of the others.
Miss Ada Killey is the acknowledged
champion lady high diver on this coast.
But the people who have watched 'her
remarkable aquatic strides are anxious
that her reputation be not bounded on the
east by the Rocky Mountains and on the
west by the Lurline Baths. Therefore,
they have induced Miss Killey to show-
Newport thi* summer her really wonder,
ful feats in swimming and diving. Sna
will leave for New] this, week.
Miss Killey swims just as well in the
surf as in the tank. La.= summer she
swam three miles out into "the ocean as
easily and lightly as a mermaid. When
she reached the boat, after a few mo
ments' rest -. declared her ability to
make the distance back aerain. but" her
friends would not permit the attempt.
Miss Killey has been swimming Just four
years. She declares that swimmers are
as often made as born.
"I was not particularly brave the rtrst
time I went in the tank," she said. "I
had made up my mind to learn to swim,
and I went again and again until I had.
mastered the A B C's of the art. When^J

'How much do I practice? Well, I go
in the water about five days of the week
for varying lengths of. time. I feel more
at home now in the water than I do' on
land. A fish out of water is not more
uncomfortable than I am if I am deprived
of my swim.
"It all looks very easy to the spectator,
but dry land spectators have no idea of
the work that it means before success
comes. I am devoted to aquatic sports
of all kinds and determined to excel in
them. The harder the proposed feat
is in the beginning the greater the pleas

are any joys on land compared to those
in water I have not discovered them."

v "I want yon to issue a paper edition of
this story, so that the price will not stand
in the way of people buying it." was the
instruction which Mr. Sheldon gave to the
publisher. The publisher demurred. It
would make the book appear "cheap." he
said. 1 and his house conkS not afford to
g"<=-t a reputation for publishing "cheap"
books. Mr. Sheldon insisted and the pa
per-bound edition was published. In just
one year it was selling at the rate of 1100
copies a day.
It found its way to England and met
with immediate favor; â â¢ ; twenty different
publishers "pirated" it, as it was not
copyrighted in England. Its sale far ex
ceeded even that in America, and a re
cent letter from an English publishing
house says that S.OOO,SÂ»>: copies 'of Mr.
Sheldon's books, have been sold in Great
Britain during the last, few months," the
greater part of them being "In His
Steps." which has been issued in twenty
editions,, ranging in price from a penny
up. ' . >
In ' a, 'twelvemonth Charles M. Sheldon
has leaped from obscurity to a position
as one of the foremost religious authors
of the day. But notwithstanding the
honors which his admirers have attempt
ed to heap upon him he Is unchanged in
all respects. He has received repeated
calls to rich Eastern churches, but in all
of his work he puts to bimseif the ques
tion made prominent in his book, "What
would Jesus do?" and he has preferred to
remain with his own little congregation.
Mr. Sheldon is still a comparatively
young man. He is a native of Wells
ville. N. V.. where he was born in 1557.
A large part of his early life was spent
on a Dakota farm, and he has much of
the spirit and dash of the West. His
father, who is also a minister, farmed
during the week days and did missionary
work on Sundays. He attended school at
Yankton, and when about 15 wrote several
lies, loung: ladies bold beyond their ca
pabilities who attempted the deep water
nave often been rescued by Miss Killey
it the critical moment. "She would be
strung 1 with medals from head to foot if
she made, any fuss about the number of
people she has rescued." said a friend.
Miss Killey Is a firm believer in wo
men learning to swim. "Half of the la
lies when they first try to swim," said
Miss Killey, "wear corsets to go in the
water, and a wet strand of hair is re
garded as a calamity. They declare they
would 'give anything to learn how to
swim,' but refuse to more than wet the
soles of their feet, because a dripping
bathing suit is so hideous!.
"There is only one way to learn how to
swim. That
is to leave I
your va.r.ity^_
and cor- t-H
in the â 
dressing- I
room
MJP^~ and to
be will: n ?
to wet your
hair anti you
have learned the
ru'iim-r.ts. After that
-he hair can be kept per-
dry while enjoying an
ordinary swim.
"To w-ar corsets in the
water is absurd.
"Swimming with the head well
out of the water is the effect which
most of the ladies like. It is very
W- pretty to look at, but is out of the
? question for long-distance, fatiguing
swimming. However, I encourage the
. ladies to swim in that fashion since it
| pleases them, and for their purpose It
meets- all the requirements."
Miss Killey herself swims in all the va
rious fashions. For the accompanying
illustrations she went to Xorth Beach and
despite wind and breakers dove a dozen
times. The springboard is just about one
fourth the height of the one from which
Miss Killey usually dives. Her diving is
exceedingly graceful and correct. She has
stories wtiich were published in the Yank
tan papers. . j . ; I â¢ ;. ;â¢ ,
"And those youthful stories." said his
father recently, '"are just as interesting
in my opinion as the ones he writes now."
Mr. Sheldon was educated at Phillips
Academy. Andover. Mass.; Brown Uni
versity, and at Andover Theological Semi
nary, graduating from the latter institu
tion in 2SSS. After a summer in Europe
he entered the ministry and began
preaching at Waterbury. Vt. But the
spirit of the West was in him. So when
he received a call to become the pastor
of the newly established Central Congre
gational Church in Topeka in ISSS he glad
ly accepted it as the opening he had been
waiting for. His church began with
sixty members, now it numbers more
than SCO. His first work was to build i
modest little church, in which he began
his strikingly original career. He was
dissatisfied with the quality of Chris
tianity.- he saw in many professed Chris
tians. He wanted to know what ideas
the. masses of the people had on the sub
ject: cf Christianity, and he wanted to
find. out; about their daily lives and occu
pations.
With -.this, desire in his heart he asked
his congregation* to excuse him from pas
toral work- for three months, and his con
gregation â  saw . little of him except dur
ing church services. He -was at home
scarcely any of the time, hut very few
people knew what he was doing.- It was
characteristic of the man. He was "get
ting acquainted." " . â  . "

Hundreds of men are employed in the
railroad shops, and hundreds of train

was among these that Mr. Sheldon spent
much of his time. He obtained an em
ploye's pass from the railroad company,
and dressed, as an employe. He made

An Eastern professional diver and
swimmer who saw Miss Killey's perform
ance the night of the entertainment said
it ' was the most clever and by far the
neatest thing of its kind that he had ever
witnessed.
This praise is reiterated by all the local
crack, miners There may be a lady
in the East who can swim is well as Miss
Killey, but you can only make them be
lieve it by optical proof.
There is no fear that Miss Killey will
no: acquit herself as well in the East

other nigTht.
That was her first appearance In pub

and dflpwins out their ideas on evÂ«-rj

with the physicians -of. Topeka',- studying
them. He read their books and visited
their patients with them. * Another week
was spent with the lawyers in their of
fices and in court. Again he spent hours
riding on street cars, talking with motor
men and conductors.
The immense sale of "In His Steps" in
England is doubtless due largely to the
fact that twenty English firms were push
ing the book at one time. An English
publication says that in four months its
circulation has far surpassed the total
circulation of all of Mrs. Henry Woods*
novels in forty years. '"East Lynr.e," which
has had a larger circulation than any
other English copyright novel, has only
reached 450.0G0 copies, and it is said that
the total number sold of William Black's
novels is not more than 300,000; "Three
Men in a Boat." a remarkably popular
book, reached 160.060; "Beside the Bonnie
Briar Bush," 90,000: "A Prisoner of Zen

II \\ a gown. Moreo%-er. a parasol is
// V alwavp one of two things â either
/â  A a flattering background for the
Jj V> face or tha most unbecoming
svttinsr imaginable.
One must consider the complexion when
ehoosir.s a parasol. Hold it up in the sun
ligbt to see whether the shade changes
and then notice whether it gives the com
plexion the tint of the rose or that of
parchment. It Is an important point to
try the parasol in the sunlight. The
color very often proves to be quite dif
ferent than when in the shadow of me
shop.
A wonderful assortment of parasols Is
aiways displayed in ihe spring. For in
the sprir.g a young giri's fancy lightly
turns to parosals as a preventive for
freckles. Every color and variety of
shape is to be found in the shops. The
wails and counters blossom as though
â¢with huge mushrooms and fungi.
Parasols are not so berutlied as they
w-re last year, but have gained some
thing in point of workmanship. They are
light and transparent and the way that
the sun shines through them in tickle.
shifting lights and shades is enchanting.
A <Ja:nty sunshade brought from Paris
by one of cur society belles is covered
t";r?t with pick moussoline de soie. Over
this :-5 smoothly drawn a tine piece of
openwork silk embroidery. The em
broidery reaches within a few inches of
the ef:ee and a band is placed around it
of white taffeta edged with a ruching cf
the mousseline.
The short handle Is of natural wood and
at the end is a piece of Ivory delicately
carved in the shape of a swan's head.
The joint of the handle is hidden by a
huge triple chou of mousseline de" sole:
and the price of this beautiful parasol?
Fifty dollars, please.
But there are numberless dainty sun
shades that are inexpensive. Grass linen
makes a jvery serviceable parasol. Avoid
chiffons if your number of parasols must
be limited and you intend devoting them
to hard service. Very pretty ones come
in summer silks.
A stylish sunshade Is of royal blue
corded silk, lined with chiffon of the same
peculiar shade. The silk is cut in deep
scallops bt-tween the ribs of the frame,
and the trimming consists of three nar
row rows of lace.
A gorccous affair is of pale blue silk
with endless billows of lace and a handle
of rosewood, which ;Â« the most popular
handle of this season. Natural wood han
dles are in High favor and next to rose
comes citron wood in point of popularity.
Another striking parasol is of blue and
while checked taffeta. Checks and stripes
are very fashionable, for the taffeta sun
shades.
A sunshade designed for dark beauties
Is of pale yellow chiffon, over which is an
applique of black lace. â¢
For street costumes there is displayed
a stunning little umbrella of a black and
â¢white plaid silk, with a deep plait border
of black.
Now. here Is a way to have all the para
sols that you crave without going into
bankruptcy. In purchasing material for a
pown buy an extra amount for your para
sols. Take all your o'ids and ends of
laces. Insertions and chiffon, with' this ma

Is Bfusfiing a Disease?
Singular Theory of a Frerjch Expert Who Has Made a
Study of Blushes.
THE ger.era! Idea that blushing Is
due to fullness of blood in the brain
is Incorrect, according to the new
theory of a French expert. It
arises from the relaxation of the
arteries of the face, neck and
breast, thus allowing- an extra, quantity
of blood to rush to the skin. Those ar
teries have in their walls a layer of rings
of muscular fiber, which contract or re
lax according to the condition .of the pa
tient, and so permit the arteries to^ be
come more or less full of blood. When
they are extra full, which occurs In weak
ness, the patient blushes.
Blushers are more liable to redden in
damp or stormy weather than in the cold
days of winter or the hot days of. summer.
If "this glowing of ihe face were the re
sult of emotion; why this difference? if
it be due to weakness the fact assumes
the appearance of probability.
Th^re are two closely allied causes of
blushing. One is named "ereuthophobia."
that is the ordinary causeâ weakness and
the extreme sensitiveness and other con
ditions caused by it. The other is desig
nated "erythopholiia." and is the fear
that one will blush unconsciously at awk
ward moments.
The latter is a peculiar form of the dis
ease. The individual in question, although
not given to Mushing, becomes gradually
possessed with a fear that ho will do so
at some inopportune time, and this fear
grows upon him until it completely mas
ters him and makes him grow red In the

TO Jump from the crown of the head
I to the soles of the feet. A secret
j| breathed in the boudoirs is that
stockings this year must have longi
tudinal stripes as they tend to make the
ankles look smaller than the horizontal
lines hitherto worn. A pretty stocking is
of black lisle thread, with vertical stripes
In Roman colors.
A pair of stockings so fine that they
could easily be drawn through a ring were
made for the last society bride. They are
of white silk, with an elaborate pattern
over the instep In real round point lace in
a butterfly design.
Some stockings are of an all-over open
work design in black silk, with colored
vertical stripes, while others have s.^-lld
uppers with fancy openwork over the
ankle. A jockey effect called the "Mas
cot" is grained by a stocking with a plain
red silk per half and black lower.
Plain stockings exquisitely woven are
generally preferred by fastidious people
who eschew these gaudy innovations.

ATHLETIC sports have had their
effect upon the footgear of the
modern young woman. The nearer
she can get her shoes like those
of her small brother the better fie is
pleased. In fact, It is whispered that she
often goes to the boys' department and
buys her boots there*.
Low shoes are almost universally worn
for the summer. A tan shoe of soft calf,
with round buildog toe and low tlat heel,
is much liked. The sole is heavy and ex
tends beyond the shoe to a truly mascu
line degree.
A similar shoe with elk skin sole Is
worn for the bicycle.
Golf shoes are laced and are not worn
so high as last season, as the skirts are
longer, even on the golf Inks. The tops
of all high shoes are cut straight.
A pretty little boot for street wear
Is made with a patÂ« nt leather lower and
calf upper. The toe is round, sole moder
ately heavy and extended. : .
For dancing and housewear, however,
the fascinating Louis Quinze heel and
more pointed toe are still in evidence.
A popular shoe of this description is of
patent leather, with a high flap extending
up from the ankle and a large buckle.
This shape is also made up in a soft red
leather, which is most fascinating in ap
pearance. A delicate tan In soft Dongola
kid Is also made in this popular shape.
An attractive little slipper is mad*: for
mourning costumes of a dull kid embroid
ered in dull jet.

It is English to speak now of chemi
settf-s worn by women as "bibs."
"Madrid" is Spanish red now adopted
without compunction by our dark beau

The revival of point d'esprit as a fash
ionable dress material helps out the
scheme for transparent effects, and when
it is decorated with real lace ap-iique de
signs It makes charming gowns. With
out the lace applique it is very pretty
trimmed with Insertion* and lace, edged
plaitings on frills of satin ribbon, and is
especially desirable for young girls.

Neither is the summer girl to be desti

quite the thing:, and Is meant to show in

of one or more men who have in the

ance. the second the diary of their case,
the third his presents and compliments
and the fourthâ alas! the fourth is meant
for the record for the way it all ended.

It remains to be seen how popular this

POOR old Dame Nature is the
most maligned, the most put upon
old lady In the world. Wherever
there is a lack of physical love
liness, be it owing to squinty
eyes, pigeon toes or a hand that
positively refuses to be pushed into a 6*4
glove, the blame Is straightway laid at
nature's door.
For the sake of Justice I would like to
remark to the army of women who are
trailing around in the world hugging the
notion to their breasts that nature has
absolutely nothing to do with the unat
tractiveness of many of the members of
the race feminine. Woman's bump of lazi
nessâwhich in some cases is abnormally
developedâ and her utter and entire dis
regard of all the laws of good breeding
and good taste are alone responsible. You
have all seen, have you not, the woman
who goes trapsing through the streets
with a yard and a halfâ more or lessâ of
skirt, bedraggled and worn at the hem,
sweeping up the germ-laden dust from
the sidewalks, or with long, scraggly pen
nants of loose tresses and scqlding locks
palling along* behind her; the woman who
administers heart-crushing doses of abuse
and advice to meek and silent husbands
when out in company; the girl who cari
catures the real beauty of a healthy,
wholesome' body and an interesting, in
telligent mind by artificial complexions,
false "frizzes" and an unnatural figure;
the rotund ladies whe persist in draping
their barrel-like proportions in plaids and
"baby waist" effects, and the willowy sis
terhood who go in for stripes and long
tailed coats and tailor gowns?
And then there is the girl who is con
stantly airing her views and talking over
her private affairs in public conveyances
or places of amusement; the young wo
man who is constantly picking up with
some new fad and who insists upon eter
nally holding forth upon the subject; the
young woman who raises a handsome silk
lined tailor-made over a rustling petti
coat only to display to the multitudes
scrubby, run-down-at-the-heel shoes, and
the gum-chewing girl! .
Dear: Dear! I falter and grow pale at
the mere thought of enumerating all the
rest of these distinctly unpleasant types
of femininity. From all these -In the
words of the good old ritual, "Good Lord,
deliver us:"
Now. I leave it to you whether nature
or the women themselves are to blame in
most cases? There is an exquisite charm
about a neatly and tastily dressed woman,
be her features ever so plain, whose hair
is not twisted up carelessly, as if just
about to fall over her shoulders; whose
gloves are not ripped at the seams, nor
any buttons missing from her boots, and
whose veil does not display any holes or
ragged ends living to the breezes.
It is in all these little details that
women show their tidiness, and it means
a lot of work. too, for there must be the
tepid or cold sponge bath every morning,
the. v.arm. soapy bath twice a week, and
the shampoo every two weeks. There
must be a careful brushing of the tresses
each day, the nails must be manicured,
gowns must be cleaned and renovated,
broken skirt bindings attended to, but
tons, 'tapes and chiffons and a thousand
other details looked after by the woman
who wishes to present the "well
ployed. These bow? and end? are not at
all In keeping with the tailor-made ef
fect of the shirt waist, with which they
are too often worn, but fashion Is a
strange inspiration and combines the
most unlikely caprices of toilet with the
utmost disr^-sjard for seeming. The long
bows and Â»:r.ds have certainly the merit
of covering deficiencies, which is perhaps
their reason for existence.

School Self-Government failed.
Self-government in the public Bchoola
of Milwaukee has come to grief. The
children were not equal to the responsi
bility, and the boys particularly wen
troublesome, being especially restive un
â¢ le surveillance of girl "policemen."
The girls who served in this capacity
were scoffed at by the boys: out of school,
and naturally they watched closely In
school for opportunities to get even with
their tormentors. Parents complained
that the system made spies of the chil
dren, caused them to be watchful of pet
ty shortcomings, revengeful when ar
rested, and degraded when brought into
the school "municipal court." Another
complaint was that the time occupied by
members of the court in trying offend
ers could be employed better in studying.
The climax came when the fact was dis

tices of his elders in politics, had been
trying to buy votes with pencils to com
pass his election as an alderman in the

it. and besides I fear a slight operation
will be necessary.
MRS. H. T. G.â You can add a little
powdered borax to your skin food if you
I wish, but I think you will find it suf
j ficiently whitening without. Fifteen
I grains would be about the proper propor
tion. Almond meal is too coarse to- be
i used as face powder. A bit of parsley
: dipped in vinegar is said to destroy the
unpleasant odor attendant upon eating
fresh young onions. Cold sores can be
cured the quickest by constant applica
tions of rosewater to which a few drops
of spirits of camphor have been added.
,W. W. A.â lf you will beat up the yolks
of two eggs until light and frothy, add
one ounce of spirits of rosemary and
one pint of warm water, and use as a
shampoo, rinsing your hair afterward in
several clear waters, you will, I am sure,
be delighted with the result.
A. T. ,R.â Those hard, geedlike white
pimples are a form of acne, and are due
to the obstruction of the sebaceous
glands, which, unable to rid. themselves
of their contents, distend and become
! hardened and prominent. Have you ever
. tried picking them out with a fine needle?
| Sometimes such treatment will take them
i away, especially if a toilet vinegar or
| good cold cream is immediately applied.
Never use a face bleach which removes
the skin. Such bleaches are made of
.corrosive sublimate, a deadly poison.
BROWNETTEâ I have not the slightest
doubt In the world that your variegated
complexion comes from one of two if not
from both causesâ poor circulation or a
torpid liver. The liver Is probably the
prime offender. Get your physician to
give you something that . will put this
organ into good working order. Do you
walk to and from your office each day?
That would do you a world of good. And
cannot you manage to have the room
heated in some way? Aside from the
damage to your complexion, it is very
wrong to undermine your health, a- you
surely will, by sitting in a room day after
day the temperature of which causes
your fingernails to become blue. Advice
contained in foregoing letter to N. E. S.
will help you also.
VIOLETâ Applications of pure lemon
juice, if followed immediately by a thor
ough smearing with cold cream, will not
dry the skin. I cannot testify a3 to the
wrinkle producing qualities of gum chew
ing, but I do know v.hat it is an unlady
like habit as well as a beauty destroying
one, for I cannot Imagine a young lady
looking pretty with .her jaws forever
working and twisting like a cow chewing
her cud, can you? For the flabby skin
use the astringent wash suggested to
Magnet in last Sunday's Call.
IDA R.â Massage will help you if it is of
the right kind, which is picking up of the
flesh between your fingers and rolling it
thinly. This treatment dissolves the tis
sues. Bathe afterward with warm water
in which is a dash of salt. It would be
wise for you to go in for light gymnastic
exercises and to confine your diet to non
fattening foods. An exercise that is par
ticularly excellent for reducing a large
stomach-is to lie. flat on the back on the
floor, with the arms out straight at the
sides. Ra^se. the body to a sitting pos-
i ture, then drop gently back on to the
floor again: Repeat this ten or fifteen
times night and morning and you will be
surprised to Bee what a difference it will
make in a short time.
FORGET-ME-NOTâ For freckles that
are of long standing :ake one teaspoontul
at powdered borax and dissolve it in one
j pint of soft water. Add one cup of butter
milk. Bathe the face with it at night be
fcre retiring. Wash it off the next morn
ing in clear tepid water. Avoid washing
i the face immediately before or just after
being in the open ,iir. I have several
times since your letter was- written given
directions for removing moles. I feel sure
you must have seen them. '
DAPHNE E.â l do not think the hair
pins had anything in the world to do with
your hair falling out so peculiarly. There
â  must be some other cause. i do not ap
prove of vaseline for the scalp, as all
such greasy applications collect dust and
i irritate the cuticle. The following tonic
i is particularly good for dandruff and will
â  stop the hair from fading: Forty-eight
! grains resorcin, one-half ounce glycerin,
and alcohol enough to fill a two-ounce
bottle. Apply every night, rubbing it into
] the scalp. Shampoo every two weeks with
' the following- egg shampoo: Shake the
yolk of an egg in a pint of alcohol, strain
; and bottle. To a bowl of warm water
add two teaspoonfuls of the liquid. Braid
the hair loosely at night. I prefer pure
white castile soap for the face to any
other. A large amount of washing soda
in the shampoo water will certainly
lighten the hair. A very small quantity
j will not have that effect. It is apt to
make the hair dry and harsh, though.
When the hair first begins to turn gray,
I look well to your health. Eat nourish
i Ing foods, get all the rest possible, â  x-â¢-
--cise in the open air. and see to it that the
! hair and scalp are kept thoroughly clean.
> Another preventive is keeping the hair
i clipped or singed. Bicycle riding is very
â¢ healthful exercise If indulged in moder
ately.
IMOGENâ Patience Is necessary when
: starting in to develop the neck and bust.
Exercise with dumbbells and swinging
; Indian clubs will help, and a nightly mas
. sage with cocoanut oil or lanolin will
certainly end in giving the desired plump
! ness. Bathing the neck and breasts In
I cold water the following morning will
also help.
PANSYâ I really have never heard of
' the mixtures you mention, so cannot give
!an opinion as to their virtues. I think the
â¢ cucumber milk, formula for which is
given in reply to N. E. S.. will work like
: a charm with your skin. Massage with
i lanolin or cocoanut oil will rill out the.
hollows in the neck. Touching the warts
with lunar caustic will remove them.
Touch the center of the wart lightly with
a lunar caustic pencil once a day. 'it will
turn black and gradually disappear. Be
careful not to get the caustic on any other
part of the skin. Binding the corn with
a slice of lemon for several nights will
I soften the growth so that it can easily
be scraped away. Use white wine vinegar
with the rose leaves.
MAY B. SMITHâ The cream you men
tion contains a small quantity of corro
sive sublimate and acts as an impercepti
ble blister on the skin, gradually removing
the cuticle. It agrees excellently well
â  with some skins. Whether or not it would

Women Should Ride Astride.
Letters Frorr) Experienced HÂ°rscbacK Riders Vigorously
Endorsing tr;e Opinion of Mrs. Walter Magee.
VieW of an Experienced
â 
j
Physician
EDITOR of The Daily CallâDear
Sir: The question "Shall women
ride astride on horseback," Is apro
pos, but should not- be handled so
lightly as was done In your issue
of Sunday. May 21. Society an
swers this question in the negative, and
society is excusable for its answer, for
that uncertain quantity known as "so
ciety" cares little and knows less as to
what is most proper, from a healthful
standpoint.
Thousands of women, innocent of any
knowledge of physical damage to them
selves from this pernicious posture, have
been, killed by the fashionable side-sad
dle, and the majority of such female rid
ers of to-day are food and fortune for
the modern gynecologists; hence "doc
tors are divided" in their opinions on this
subject, but modern physicians are not,
nor will they be. None other than the
women themselves (and their physicians)
know the miseries and troubles which
are produced and nurtured by" this fash
ion, and women should know the origin
of â¢ this practice, which, however, need
not be mentioned here.
Mrs. Walter Magee. and others who
have endeavored to do away with this
worse than stupid fashion deserve the
highest praise for their clear perception
of woman's needs for true reform in this
direction, and their decision that "tire
side-saddle must go" is a wise one. .X
As to the "physiological and artistic
part," it must be admitted that the long
riding skirt, as an accompaniment to the
side-saddle, together with the high silk
hat. has had some charms for the femi
nine devotees to this pastime; but this
skirt has been the cause of so many ac
cidents . by entanglement in gates,
fences, horses' hoofs, etc.. that it has
generally been discarded and the short
one substituted- But what an unenviable
sight is a lady when clad in the present
short riding skirt, "humped up" on a
side-saddle and busily engaged .in trying
yourself some bags out of cheesecloth, fill
them with the oatmeal and use in the
bath. The least harmful liquid rouge is
made by filling a widf-necked bottle with
the petals of dark red roses and covering
these with the best wine vinegar obtain
able. As a general thing liquid rouge is
not -particularly desirable. Pansy, like
yourself, suffers from a "big ache that
from a little toe corn grew," so please
read what I have said to her on the sub
ject.
ANXIETY â I fear I can suggest no
means by which a receding chin may be
made to appear less so. Apply a little
cold cream to the skin at the base of the
nail each night. If you will soak your
fingers in warm water every day and
press back the cuticle with an old piece
of linen you will have less trouble with
your ails. I feel certain.
MAY W. â The only way that you can
darken your hair is by means of a dye.
Henna will not injure your hair and will
color it a bright red. Do not. I beg of you,
attempt any of these things on your "hair
yourself 01 you may emerge with a head
of more varied hues than was Joseph's
coat. If you will send me a stamped ad
dressed envelope I will send you the ad
dress of some one who will do it for you.
M. F. S. â Almond meal is very good for
the skin and can be used in place of soap.
The nicest way to use it is to put it Into
little cheesecloth bags, wet one of them
and with it wash the face, rinsing after
ward in clear water. Treatment for facial
eruptions calls first of all for careful, hy
gienic living. Never eat rich pastries,
fatty foods or sweets. Live on a fruit and
vegetable diet as much as possible and be
sure that the digestive organs are kept
free an- :.cf>ve. Take your bath daily,
exercise regularly and have your sleeping"
room wen ventilated. Then get a little
bottle of peroxide of hydrogen and apply
to the bothersome little pimples with a
spor.sre. Us? cold cream also. As soon a3
the skin is perfectly free of the eruption,
besin with a complexion brush of firm
white bristles to do away with the black
h^ads. Scrub the face thoroughly with,
the brush every night befpre going to bed,
using warm vr&ter and pure castile soap.
If the blackheads are very bad add a lit
tle alcohol to the water." That is very
cleansing, but as .t is also drying, a face
cream should 'â â¢ rubbed on immediately
after the face has been rinsed and wiped.
If this does not help you. write to me
again, and I will suggest something elsÂ»Â».
The hair tonic you mention is very good,
as far as I know. As your hair is so very,
oily I would suggest the following tonic:
One-half pint alcohol: one-half pint wa
ter; SO grains of quinine. Apply every
other night, rubbing it into the scalp.

BUSTER JOHN SEES
HODO
Copyrighted, 1599, by Joel Chandler Harris.
NOW the lucky chance which gave Buster John opportunity to see
the fox hunt was both curious and interesting. The date was
fixed upon, and the children's grandfather invited the hunters to
spend the night with him. bo as to have an early start the next
morning. So, one Friday afternoonâ the hunt was to take place
on Saturdayâ hunters began to arrive, some singly and some In
couples, until all had arrived except young Maxwell and his hound Hodo.
Mr. Kilpatrick came, bring Music and "Whalebone, and Tip, with others.
Mr. Collingsworth brought Fanny, and Rocket, and Bartow, with their
chorus; and Mr. Dennis brought Rowan and Ruth and Top and Flirt.
There were other hunters with their dogs, and one or two gentlemen
who had no dogs, but who wanted to see the sport.
But these hunters, their friends and their dogs, were not the ones
Bnster John wanted to see. So he continued to watch the big gate at
the head of the avenue. Sweetest Susan watched with him, Drusilla be
ing nusy helping their mother, who as a good housekeeper looked after
her dining-room and was not afraid to go into the kitchen. Buster John
was anxious lest young Maxwell would fail to come, and said so many
timpr.. He had once heard his grandfather reading something that Max
welinad written in the county paper, and he had also heard the negroes

his horse. Butterfly, and his hound, Hodo! What wonderful tales old

. But when the sun was about an hour high, and just as Buster John
had giyon up all hope, he saw the big gate swing open. A large dog
camo through and after him a rider on a sorrel horse. Without alight
ing from his horse, the rider pulled the gate to, and, leaning down until
Buster John could see nothing but one of his feet pressing against the
saddle fastened the catch. Buster John had never seen the gate opened
and * h ut In this fashion before, fcr the latch had been purposely fixed
low so that the little negroes could open the gate for vehicles going out

these inarticulate clamors into articulate
form. The dumb and soulless majority
claim him as their spokesmen. Q
honest, easy men of the present may faJI
t<> recognise in his audacious utterance
the tocsin r,t the past, the alarum of the
future. They continue their pathway to
and fro upon the crust of present conven

fool, or. worse still, as an anarchist, per
versely and wickedly seeking to overturn
the t.-aablished order which brings plum
pudding to some and bread to many.
But the folly of one generation becomes
the wisdom of the next. The French Rev

aristocrats who turned a deaf ear to the
former and continued their mad dance
over the prostrate form of the plebeian
woke to see that form resurgent, and
ended by finding themselves strung Tip to
lanterns to the music of me latter.
Is such a revolution Impending in Amer

fought not with bullets, but with ballots?
If so, Edwin Markham will prove to be
at once its despised prophet and its ac

Hang my saddle and blanket on the side fence yonder. I'll go in and tell

He wont in the house with each of the children holding him by a
hand. He seemed to b3 a child with them. He shook hands with th*
host and with the other guests, and excused himself on the plea that
he wanted to have a frolic with the children. He was seventeen, Â»ut
had none of the characteristics of that age. He was even more Juvenile
in his actions than Sweetest Susan. He made the children call him
J<*. and asked them where there was a shelter where he could put his
saddle to keep it out of the dew.
"Make Johnny Bapter hahg it up with the rest in the carriage house "
suggested Buster John.
"No," said young Maxwell. "This is a peculiar saddle. It has a'dog
tlod to it by an invisible string." Sure enough! When they reached the
side fence there was Hodo lying directly under the saddle and blanket
which Johnny Bapter had placed on the fence. "You can see the do
and saddle," remarked Maxwell, " but you can't see the string "
Buster John suggested the old carpenter shop, which was a long shed
room, the entrance to which had no door. There was a pile of shavings
in the shop, and Joe Maxwell said it was the very place of all others
So he placed his saddle on the workbench, kicked the shavings together
and told Hodo he could go to bed and pull the cover over his head when
he pot ready.
"Will he stay?" Buster John asked. The other dogs were all fastened
up in the blacksmith shop to keep them from going home.
Young Maxwell laughed. "He'll stay there till I come after the sad
dle, unless 1 call him out."
He was for returning to the house, but just then the children saw
their grandfather and his other guests coming in their direction.
"Maxwell," said Mr. Collingsworth, "I've heard a heap of loose talk
about this wonderful dog of yours. I lay you I have two can outfoot
him: Dennis has another and Kilpatrick another. Where' ve you hid him?
I don't mind dark horses in politics, but 1 don't like dark dogs in fox
chases."
"Then you'll not like Hodo." remarked Joe Maxwell, "for he's very
dark, almost black. Come. Hodo."
The hound instant. y came from the shed and stood looking at his
â  r, his hfad turned expectantly to one side. This gesture, as you
may call it. was somewhat comical, but it was impressive, too. Hodo
was large for a bound, but very compactly built. His breast bone and
fore houlders were very prominent, his chest was>deep and full, hid
hams were almost abnormally developed, and his tail ran to a keen
point. His color was glossy black except for a dash of brown and white
on his breast and legs and a white strip between his eyes. His ears were
shorter than those of the average pointer. His shape and build were on
the order of a finely bred bull terrier, only on a very much larger scale.
"You call that a hound?" remarked Mr. Collingsworth, jokingly.
"If the Birdsong dogs are hounds." responded Joe Maxwell.
"He's a pretty dog," said Mr. Kilpatrick, "but he'll have some warm
work cut "Ut for him in the morning. '
During this brief conversation Buster John had approached dose to
Hodo, and now laid his hand on the dog caressingly. Hodo flinched as if
'â  had been stung, and snarled savagely, but instinct or curiosity caused
him to nose the youngster, and then he whined and wagged his tail joy
ously, as if he had found an old friend.
"Well, well!'.' exclaimed Maxwell; "this is the first time I have ever
known him to make friends with a stranger. He has two faults, a bad
temper and a hard head.'- 1
Hodo fawned on Buster John, and whined wistfully. fm<- ( . he curved
his tail in peculiar fashion, and ran around and hither and yonder as
if hÂ»- were keen for a frolics/Maxwell was so astonished at these mani
festations that he could do nothing but laugh. Hodo's antics, however
had attracted attention another quarter. A brindle cur belonging to

Western Poets and Critics.
The fecund West, which spawns great
poets i>y the scores and follows ihim up
with great critics by the hundreds. In
â  re). t that the latter may discover the
former has derided that here is the
greatest of all the great Western poets.
Borne great critics go further. One as
thar "The Man With the Hoe"
touches the high water mark of Ameri
can achievement in verse. Another, more
modest, but p;t ill a master of ill consid
ered superlatives, thinks it the .best thing
written by an American author in a quar
ter of a century. A third holds that it
stamps the author as "one of the great
est thinkers in the world." A fourth,
more weirdly impressionistic in his lan
guage, declares that "he goes down into
;])â¢â¢ dim places of the dead; he reaches
in heart-warm prayer to the Father of
Life." A fifth says. "This poem comes as
the cry of the ZHtgr ist."
A large number of great Western critics
join in agreeing that Markham is the
foremost name in poetical literature since
Tennyson and Jirownlng.
"Where's your Wully Shak< speare

of the Edinburgh Theater, rejoicing over
the Buccess of John Home's "Douglas."

Man With the Hoe" is not a great poem
in the st-ns^ that the. masterpieces of
Tennyson or Browning, or even Kipling,
are great poems. One may still hold to
the comparison with "The Marseillaise"
and the "Â©a Ira." But neither "The Mar-
Beillaise" nor the "Ca Ira" Is a great
poem. Both were great rallying cries, as
"The Man With the Hoe" may prove to
be. They voiced a prevalent and event
ually dominant mood. They possessed the
stormfu] energy of passionate protest. All
this is true likewise of the newer lyric.
But of all three it is true that they have

AJtamont Parlor of Occidental, Sonoma
and came rushing: toward him, barking ferociously. The cur was as
large as Hodo and quite as formidable looking. The hound heard the
challenge and rushed to accept it, and the two dogs came together some
distance from the spectators. There was a fierce wrangle for the ad
vantage, and then those who were watching the contest saw Hodo
dragging the cur about by the neck and shaking him furiously. When
Hodo finally gave him his liberty the cur ran toward the negro quarters.
"I told you he wasn't a hound!" exclaimed Mr. Collingsworth. "If
he is, he's not a common hound."
"I agree with you there," said Joe Maxwell, laughing.
Returning from his encounter, Hodo went to Buster John and rubbed
his head against the youngster and followed him about. This, of course,
was very pleasing to Joe Maxwell; for ordinarily Hodo was very vicious
with stra/igers. and especially with children.
When supper, which was a very substantial meal, had been discussed,
Joe Maxwell railed for Buster John and the two went to the lot. On the
way there they were joined by Johnny Bapter.
"Show me where my horse is, Johnny Bapter," said Joe Maxwell.
"Ho right yonder, suh, in de best stall dey is. His legs all clean."
"Well, then. Johnny Bapter, I want fifteen ears of corn, not the big
gest, with sound ends, and two bundles of fodder. Put the corn in the
trough, untie the bundles of fodder outside, and whip as much of the dust
out of it as you can. And then place a bucket of water in one end of
the trough."
This was all very quickly and deftly done, for Joe Maxwell's tobacco,
as Johnny Bapter described it, "tasted like mo'," and the way to get
more was to look after that sorrel horse.
"I hope you are going along with us in the morning," said Joe Max
well to Buster John as they were returning to the house.
"Oh, I wish T could!" the boy exclaimed; "I'd give anything to go, but
mamma says I'm too young. She's afraid something will happen to me."
Young Maxwell laughed. "Why, I went fox-hunting before I was as
old as you. Mr. Dennis took me behind him twice, because I promised I
wouldn't hunt rabbits with his fox hounds."
"Please toll mamma that!" cried Buster John.
"I certainly will," said Maxwell.
And ho did. As soon as they went in the house he took Buster John
by the hand and went into the parlor where the lady was entertaining
her guests with music and conversation. She was in high good humor.
Her eye sparkled, and her laughter was pleasing to the ear.
"Come in, you two boys," she cried merrily. "Here's a comfortable
chair by meâ shall I call you Mr. Maxwell? I used to call you Joe when
you were younger."
"Everybody calls me Joe," said Maxwell. "T have come to ask you a
favor. Will you allow Buster John to go hunting with us to-morrow
morning?"
"Why, who ever heard of such a thing?"
"Mr. Dennis, there, has heard of itâ twice."
The lady looked at Mr. Dennis, who gave an affirmative nod. "How
would he go?" she asked.
"On my horse, behind me."
"What do you think of it, father?"
"Why. I think he will be perfectly safe with Joe."
"Let him go. by all means," said Mr. Dennis emphatically. "It wiil
help to make a man of him."
"But two on a horse in a fox chase? Why, it's ridiculous!" exclaimed
the lady. "The horse would break down in hali* an hour. "
"How much does Buster John weigh?" Joe Maxwell asked.
"Fifty-five," said Buster John, proudly.
"Then the horse would carry a hundred and forty pounds. Mr. Pen
nis weighs at least thirty pounds more than that, and .he's the smallest
man in the party."
There was nothing for the mother to do but give her consent, though
she gave it with many misgivings, as mothers will, and with many ad
monitions to Joe Maxwell to take care of the boy, which he faithfully
promised to do.
To make sure that he would not be left behind. Buster John begged
to be allowed to sloop in the room with Maxwell. This point was easily
carried, and the youngster went off to bed triumphantly, an hour earlier
than usual. He was asleep when the hounds were fed on warm corn
bread, fspeeially prepared for them; and he was far in the land of dreams
when, n little later, Joe Maxwell carried Hodo his supper, which Jemlmy
(bribed with tobacco for her pipe) had "saved out" for him. It was not
large in amount, but carefully selected, and no doubt Hodo enjoyed it,
for he made no complaint about it.
Bustor John, as has been said, went to bed happy and triumphant,
and it seemed to him that he had been in bed but a few moments when
he fill Joe Maxwell shaking and rolling him about in bed, and hoard
him cry out:
"Where's this famous fox-hunter who was to go along and tako .care
of me this morning? The horses are all ready, breakfast is ready (so
Jemlmy saysi, and everybody is ready except the Great North Ameri
can Fox-Huntor, known far and wide as Buster John. What can ba
the matter with him?"
In this way Bustor John was aroused to the realities, and he romem
bered with a thrill of delight that this was to be the day of .lays, ho
far as he was concerned. He leapt from the bed and was dresssed in a
jiffy.
"Don't wake the house, my son," said Joe Maxwell, solemnly. "There's
your overcoat your mother Bent up last night; the air is chilly this
morning. There was a cold rain during the night."
"But you have no overcoat," remarked Buster John.
as he used to sign himself, was a name
familiar to Eastern editors lons before
his Western critics discovered him. He
is now more than 50 years of age. and has
been contributing to Harper's and Scrib
ner"s and the Atlantic for nearly a quar
ter of a century. But not until the ap
pearance of "The Man With the Hoe" did
he wake up to find himself famous.
This fame has not turned his head. FT"
speaks modestly enough of his own per
formance to the reporters who flock to
him for Interviews.
"I am a man of the hoe." he said to one
of these. "1 am a child . > f the furrow.
All my youth was paused on a farm and
cattle range, am nfi thi hard, severe con
ditions thai pro with thai â  fe. So when I
write of the man with the hoe 1 write to
sum.' extent of my own experience."
Mr. Markham has been for many years
the principal of a school in Oakinnd. Cat.
Ten years .-ig-i. he tells us. he made a visit
to a loan exhibition In San Francisco, and
then for the lirsi 'yie- saw Millet's paint-
Ing, "The Man \Vi:h the. Hoe."
Millet's Painting.
"I sat for an hour before the painting,
and all the time the tenor and power if
the picture was growing upon me. I saw
that this creation of the painter was no
mere peasant, no chance man In the
fields, but. he was rather a type, a symbol
of the toiler, brutalized thrcuph ' ing ages
of industrial oppression. 1 saw in this
peasant the Blow but awful degradation
of man through endless, In peic'sa and joy
less labor. I saw in the peasant betrayed
humanity, for, Cain to the contrary, we
are all more or less our brother's keeper.
This picture stuck in my mcmoTy for ten
years, until my Christmas vacation, and l
wrote out the impression of it that had
been springing up through my soul all
these years." ,;?
But we who now have a chance to read
Mr. Markham's verse in- its entirety can
recognize that in many a prelude to the
final utterance he breathed the same spir
it of altruistic love for the oppressed and
hatred for a system which produces un
conscious and .unintentional oppressors.
Here, for example, Is a little waif now
housed in his palace of art: '"/
Armageddon.
We sit here and whisper and wonder
Of tho woes that are coming: on earth.
When the stooped, silent tollers In thunder
Shall ask what" the ages are worth.
There'll be curses and cries for the reasons,
And a tempest of- feet on the stairs;
Anil klnK;< will turn white In their treasons
And prelates grow pale at their prayers.

NATIVE DAUGHTERS.
The anniversary ball given by Golden
State Parlor in Vnion Square Hall on the
night of the 25th of May was one of the
delightful events in the history of the
parlor. There was a good attendance of
members and their friends, who, under
the supervision of the committ.ee. consist
ing of Misses M. Tietjen. A. Ackman. L.
Fahrenkrug, Rosa Day, L. Meyer and F.
yon Staden, enjoyed a very fine pro
gramme of dances. Golden State is a
live parlor and always has a host of
friends.
The members of Alta Parlor had a night
at the Steeplechase last week, and it was
such an enjoyable event that there is not
a member who is not glad that she did
not stay away.
Calaveras Parlor has elected Miss M
McFarland as its delegate to the Grand
Parlor. This parlor, which was instituted
but a few months ago, has now a mem
bership of thirty-five, and it is expected
that at the next meeting five more will be
initiated. At the last held meeting the
parlor was visited by Mrs. Lena Hilke
Mills, the grand president, and for her
benefit there was an exemplification of
the ritualistic and floor work. The visiting
ofllclal was loud in her praise of the work
of the officers, it being as perfect as any

"Oh. T'm tough," replied Joe Maxwell. "I've been out to look after
my horse and dog. They are both prime, and the weather is primp. If
the fox we are going after is a friend of yours, you may as well bid
him good-by this morning-"
"He's very cunning," explained Buster John. "A great many dogi
have chased him. He is called Scar-Face."
"I've heard 'of him many a time," replied Joe Maxwell. "That's thoj
reason I'm here to-day. If he's in the neighborhood this morning, and Â»
you get a chance, tell him good-by."
"I think he knows all about this hunt," Buster John ventured to say.
"Oh, does ho? Well, it will be a mighty good, thing for him if he haa
moved his quarters; but we'll beat around and about and see if he won't
eive us a dare."
"I know where he used to stay," said Buster John. He didn't know
whether he was doing right or wrong. "Aaron showed me."
"Aaron? Well, Aaron knows all about it, and he knows a good deal
more than that. Some of these days I'm going to write a book about
Aaron."
"Sure enough?" cried Buster John. "I can tell you lots of things to
put in it. .1 can tell you things that nobody would believe if they hadn't
seen 'em."
"Well, I'll tell you what we'll do," said Joe Maxwell; "we'll make a
bargain:. You shall tail the fox to-day if you'll tell me all about Aaron."
Buster John agreed, and the two shook hands over the contract in thfe
most solemn fashion. In a few moments they were eating breakfast,
which was a very good one for that part of the country, even if tho
coffee was made of parched rye and sweetened with honey. Shortly
afterward the hunters were ready to ride to the field. It was still dark,
but dawn was beginning to show itself, and by the time the final start
was, madeâ the children's grandfather having to give some directions to
Aaronâ dawn wits fairly upon them, and the chickens, were fluttfrir?
from their roosts.to the ground and walking dubiously about in the half
lifjht. '
Now old Scar-Face, confident of his powers, had done a very foolish
thing. During the night, and while the rain was still falling, he had
ventured to reennnoiter the Abererombie place. He came out of the
sedge field through the bars, crossed the road, and went sneaking as
far as the gin-house. Here he stopped and listened. The night was
still, but his quick ears heard noises that would have been Impercep
tible to human ears â the playful squeak' of a rat somewhere In the gin
house, a Held mouse skipping through the weeds, the fluttering of wings
of some night bird. He heard the barking of dogs. too. but not a strange
voice among them. He heard the Spivey catch-dog, with his gruff and
threatening bnrk. Far away he heard a hound howling mournfully. The
hound was evidently tied. Close at hand barked the cur that had chal
lenged Hodo; he had not yet recovered his good humor.
But not a strange voice came to his ears. This was easily accounted
for. The hounds that were to pursue him had been comfortably fed *
and were now fast asleep, while Hodo was curled up in shavings, dream
ing that be had bis mouth right on a fleeing fox. but couldn't seize him.
He whined and moved his limbs as he dreamed, and a prowling cat that
had paused to investigate the noise in the shavings flitted away. All
the sounds that came to old Scar-Face's ears were familiar; so, from
the gin-house he sneaked to the barn, as noiselessly as a ghost, pausing
on the way to listen. Hearing nothing, he went further until he was
under the eaves of the barn, in one end of which the horses of the hunts
men were stabled. Here he stopped and listened for some rime. What
could the silence mean? Peeping from the sedge-field during the after
noon he had seen more than one horse and rider pass along the road,
and several whiffs of strange dogs came to h!s sensitive nose. He con
cluded that these men and dogs meant another chase after him; but he
was not certain, and so came forth in the dark to investigate.
Usually when hounds are taken away from home and fastened up out
of sight of their masters some of the younger ones will get lonely anÂ«l
begin to bark and howl. Old Scar-Face knew this well, but he didn't
know that seasoned dogs rarely ever make such a demonstration unless
thej are hungry. Consequently, when he heard no barking and howl
ing-, he was almost convinced that, after a night's foray, he could return
to the sedge-field and sleep undisturbed the next day. Still thero was a
doubt, nnd to rase his fears he decided to test the matter more fully.
On a fence near him a hen and half a dozen pullets were peacefully
roosting. Me crept up directly under the hen, gathered his strong legs
under him. leaped upward, and the next mompnt was cantering through.
the dry. weeds dragging the squalling hen by the wing. Surely the racket
was sufficient to alarm the plantation. At the bnrn he dropped the hen,
placed a forefoot firmly upon her, and held his head higli to listen.
There was certainly a loud response to the hen's alarm. The geese in
the spring-lot made a tremendous outcry, seconded by the guineas, but
the only dog that barked was the cur that made a mistake by attack
ing Hodo.
This certainly seemed to be a fair test, and old Scar-Face was satis
fied. He crushed the poor hen's neck in his cruel jaws, and put an end.
to her appeal for help. He was not very hungry, but hf> carried the hen,
home, promising himself a hearty breakfast in the morning. Ho ate a
good ration, however, and then curled himself snugly together until he
looked like :i big ball of yellow fur.
He was awake early the next morning, but before be was half through
his breakfast the light of day was beginning to creep under the briars,
when he heard a long, mournful wail at the Abercrombie place, followed
by another. How often he had heard this wail! It w;is the cry of fn\.
hounds. He stayed not to hear it repeated, but skipped out into the gray
dawn, like the shadow of fear stealing away from the light.

sence, while the giddy fairy may not
dominate the chorus, and while the
Btage manager may not have received
his education at the London Lyceum,
the hone and sinew of an operatic com
pany is all there." Bone and sinew
sound well and are good things to
have; and Mr. Wyatt, the' manager,
promises me that the homeliness of the
chorus will be diluted by a handsome
bunch of damsels from the local Italian
colony; and as there are several shops
in town that make a business
of renting decent opera costumes,
it is possible to triumph over
some of these material difficul
ties. And the orchestra, which here
tofore numbered a beggarly dozen
instruments, will for us be swelled to
thirty. However, to-morrow night will
tell the tale. 1 am not much given to
booming the unknown and unheard,
but from all signs it seems to me that
the town ought to turn out to-morrow
night and find out for itself of what
stuff these modest Lambardisare made.

takes a particularly sensitive ear to
find how much worse is oni recent

good music, but in the next bar it is

its enterprise in producing pieces that
are new to us, but as l live I would
rather sit to a revival of even "The Bo

"Nicotine."
Besides singers yet unheard we are
promised on Monday night in the Co

titled, from the pen of Mrs. E. F. Rigrgs,
a Southern woman. Herbert Kelcoy and
EfTip Shannon will produce it and a
prize of $100 will be given the lucky

the theatrical business the name of a

the contestants for the title prize I ana
come to the conclusion that either I am
;i very bad reader or the m; n who
K"t it up a very bad writer; and with
all modesty I am Inclined to give my
self the !)â¢ nefll of the doubt. The most
of this printed story deals in events

curtain rises cm the first act. A simple
intelligence like my own finds much
difficulty in mastering the complica
tions that follow this "period of titn<>
elapsed," as they are set forth in the
documents, but I dare say that Mr.
Kelcey, Mips Shannon and their asso
ciate players will puncture th-so mys
teries very nicely iii the performance.
As I try to make it out. one of the big
situations in this new comedy is where
the young woman mistakes the man
who subsequently marries her to be her
long-losi father. [ may be wrong, but
T think that is what la Intended by the
BcenaHo. Certainly it is a novel com
plication. It docs not pay tÂ«, trust ton
much to the public, and I ima.gino that

lowing Blanche Bates' triumphs in New

Fadden." During the stork season in
Baltimore she lias played all sorts of
parts, from the flip to the emotional, and
the Baltimore critic; fcive her as much
praise In serious as in comedy work. One

Outer World
The Washington papers are thick with
compliments of Frank Mafhieu, who is
playing with the Frawleys In the capital
city. In a recent production of "The
Wife" Myron Calico was taken ill and
Mr. Mathieu had to take his part, that
of Matthew Culver, the villain, at short
notice. He was nervous at first, hut be
fore- the night was over achieved a dis
tinct success.
Charles Krohman is reported to have
said, after the curtain fell on the first
performance of the Adams revival of
r 'Romeo and Juliet," on Monday evening
of last week: "T am going to make a bid
for the Western riÃhts to that play. I
think it would be a hit in that section
of the Country." Maude Adams is to ap
pear in New York January 1 in a new
Barrie play. Mr. Frohman thinks of let
ting her try "As You Ltke It" or
"Twelfth Night" next season.
, Sarcey came out on top in his ex
change of wit with Coquelin. Hlfl first
article said: "Coquelin finds that I am
growing old. Alas, we all grow old, my
poor friend. You have just discovered
that for yourself in playing Bonaparte.
You divide my life into two parts; up to
1880 I was the national critic; after that I
became foolish. I think you an' mistaken.
The lines of division are not so simply
drawn. I have my days, like everybody,
and. which is extraordinary, my days cor
respond with yours. When you played
Petrucio in Mejfere apprivoisee I waa the
next day full of talent and Intelligi
You no sooner played Fanfan de Tulipe
than I became an idiot. You playpd
Labrissiere in "Thermidor" and 1 again
became the national critic. You played
Ohnei's Colonel Roquebrune and again I
fell. You played Cyrano de Berger.ic and
I reached theclouds. You play Bonaparte
and I become an old fool. Oh, my
Coquflin; I pray you, play only fro. mi rod -.
and play them always perfectly. If you
will not do this for your sake, do it for
mine."
Mrs. Craigie's three-act blank verso
tragedy, "Os-born and T'rsyne," which has
been bought by George Alexander, is
published in the June number of T^ady

DRIED FRUITS IN NEW YORK.
The New York Commercial nays:
"Special reports from sixteen counties in ;
Texas received up to date are to the effect
that there will be few poaches raised there .
this season. Th estimates vary with different j
locations, but in no case will they be above j
three- fourths, while in many cases the trees j
did not bloom at all. Conditions are favorable |
for the growers who have a small crop. |
"Lest year tho yield of the same counties j
â was some thousands of cars, which shows
what thÂ» less to producers will be' this seiison.
While drying has not been carried an very ex
tensively' a* regard* Texas peaches, the short- ]
otre th( re will create a fctrongrer demand lur i
fresh fruit from the drying sections, and thus
roduce the supply available for drying. Spot
stocks an- practically exhausted, and it would
be difficult to secure any considerable blocks
lrom llrst hands. Prices rule firm, and con
cession thouch frequently asked, â¢-â  nearly
always refused. Tre.de is Quiet, and limited
to only small lots. Stocks on the coast are out
of first I Binds and all supplies are held stiff.
"Apriccts passed from lirst hands si me j
wseks ago, anc: second hands are very mm |
In their views regarding the price to be paid. j
Buyers are not anxious, because it will be
only a short time when the new crop will come
in and the supply of fresh fruits prevents any
special demand for ild goods 'â¢ â 'â â â  So far as
known, no sales of new crop foods have re
sulted from reported offers of >'.â¢<â¢, or there-,
abouts, for export. Lower quotations are ex- ;
pected later, aa offerings so .lar have been lor
speculative purpoees alone.
"Prunes are unchanged. It Is practically Im
possible to make any definite statement, but it i
Is quite ICk-Iy that many holders would dis
pose of supplies below the market to save the |
expense of carrying over until next seat*, a
"Raisins are quiet, after the reported sale of
a number of cars tor outside dealers. Condi
tions otherwise are unchanged, the market be
ing held steady by Short supplies and a dis
position to prevent price cutting so far as I
possible."
FRUITS AND SALMON IN ENGLAND.
California fruits continue to move off stead
ily into consumption, and prices are well main
tained, says the London Grocers' Gazette of
May 20. For the 1599 pack some amount of
business has been done at high prices; pack- !
ers generally are at present, however, disin- !
clined to make firm offers. The only ship- ;
ment of Frnser River salmon to London this
season has arrived this week, the Celtic Race
bringing 80.0SS cases, of which a considerable
proportion has been sold to arrive. The mar
ket remains In much the same condition as |
reported during the past few weeks, buyers :
and sellers continuing to hold aloof.
CANNED FRUITS IN NEW YORK.
Mall advices from New York say; "Trade in
California canned goods continues heavy, even
though prices were withdrawn some tlma ago
and no new quotations have been given out.
There are many conflicting stories regarding
the combination of packers on the cnast, but
aside from the preliminary deals nothing has
leen arranged as yet. and, according to the
t est Information obtainable, nothing will be
pllshed before fall. The discussion has
feet on the market, but probably does not
limit sales In any degree."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW TOUK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, June 3.â Yesterday's sharp up
turn In prices haul tha effect of encouraging
the formation of ,a bull party In the stock
market, and they ma.de It sufficiently ob
vlotiH at the opening of the trading and even
before that they had fixed upon the storks
of new steel combinations and a few other
Industrial specialties us the most promising
fltld for operations. Tips were disseminated
through Inspired sources and by pub
lication of coming: dividend declarations
on several of these properties and
their fries were bid up In an unosten
tatious, way at the opening. There was not
the expected enthusiasm, however. In sup
porting prices, either by the outride demand
or by the professional traders. The higher level
of prices Invited profit-taking by some of the
buyers of yesterday, and the advance came
to a standstill. There was a hardening of
prices on covering by shorts In expectation of
a favorable bank statement. But the statement
wan, on the contrary, unfavorable, and the
Ealns which had b"i?n established by the bull
clique were quickly marked out. -There was
very little liquidation Induced by the decline,
nnc the closing was quiet and somewhat Ir
regular In tone and stowed net losses In the
majority of cases. The holiday In London
deprived the market of what has been a
so-.irce of strength In the last few days. West
ern Union, Brooklyn Transit and Sugar showed
evidences or rather acute weakness, and In
the railroad li** Northern Pacific and the coal
ers were centers of depression. Fractional
gains were retained In a few stocks, *uriy ad
vancen not being entirely wiped out lii the
Iron and steel group. The bank statement was
v. surprise, as It was expected that the liquid
ation In the stock market would have resulted
Jr. a contraction of loans and a decrease in de
posit liabilities. Instead of this there was
a Fir>all Increase In loans.
'Die decrease in cash was expected, and was
flue to the engagement of gold for export and
to losses to the banks by reason of the small
r::ccss .if revenue returns over Government ex
penditures which Is now the rule. | There was
very little business transacted In the bond
market and price changes were small.
â¢Mi- short week on the Stock Exchange has
bf?n characterized by a dazzling campaign and
quick retreat by the bear* They found a
number of conditions in their favor when they
returned to the BtrÂ«t on Wednesday after the
throo days' holiday, and they sold stocks with
great confidence and soon broke the market.
The exhaustion of margins on the decline
brought out a flood of lone stocks which en
abled the shorts to cover extensive lines at Ii
yoo<l profit. Probably the most Influential fac
tor In determining the bear attack, woe the
abandonment if the purpose to sustain the
prices of the new Amalgamated Copper stock
at or above oar. The 575,0b0,000 of stocks of
this organization was largely oversubscribed at
par and the payment of subscriptions was com
pleted a week an â¢ Monday. The subscribers
wore understood to Include some of the most
powerful interests In the country and the new
Ftorl: was supported at or above par oil last
week in face of a very languid public demand
When the price was allowed to slump to B.'. on
Wednesday and Thursday in the outside market
it was Interpreted to mean that the powerful
backers were not- disposed to combat the reac
tionary tendency la prices for the present.
Fortified by acquleecenoe on the part of the
element which bad frustrated previous attempts
to force down prices, the powerful bear party
i'receeded to work their will with no Important
opposition. A larce body of security owners'
bad lor some time been In the position of in
ertly holding on waiting for a further rise In
prices. When the bears began to , offer prices
down by wide taps â¢ and the owners, taw the |
>ulue of their holdings beinar Cut away from
under them they became alarmed and threw '
over their holdings .Indiscriminately. Among i
the causes contributing to the break
were showings of reduced net earnings i
for April by the St. Paul, Burlington, Northern '
Pacific and Union Pacific systems, for which
subsequent plausible explanations were of
fered, but which were on their lace evidence of
:t decrease in the .sums available for distribu
tion among the stockholders. Tl'ere was a
hardening tendency in exchange, foreshadow
ing an outward movement of cold, which came
in the announcement after banking hour* on
Thursday of an - engagement of $1,000,000 for
shipment to Europe. The fact that this engage
ment was made after an easing Of the rate for
sterling exchange led some exchange bankers
to question whether the operation could yield
a profit p..-- an ordinary transaction.
The fact that it was made by the Institution
that financed the Amalgamated Copper Com
pany and also the payment of the Philippines
indemnity may serve as an explanation. The
purpose was to provide for the payment to
Spain, BO as to avoid the export of gold, and
a sufficient amount of foreign exchange was
accumulated to cover the amount due to Spain,
so that the cold (or- certificates of gold) could
be transferred from the sub-treasury In New
York to the banking Institution. It was ob
viously a corellary of the plan to set off for
eign obligations . to the bank, including; pre
sumably i. -reign "subscriptions to the new cop
per company, to make up the foreign credits
turned over to the Government. But the opera
tions seem to have Induced a plethoric condi- |
tion in the local money market and a hardening
tendency in the London money market, which
were nut counted upon, ana which made the
outward movement of gold necessary to restore
the balance. The relief to the London money
market gave strength to the stock market
there, which spread to Americans Â«nd was re
flected back upon the New York stock market.
This, with the fall in wheat, the subsidence of
the yellow fever scare and good prospects in
the coal carriers, led to good recoveries. Prices
recovered to last week's level or above all
around.
Bonds sold off In sympathy with stocks, but
they were later in yielding and declines were
much lets marked.

ASSOCIATED BANKS' STATEMENT. <$>
NEW TORIC. June 3.â The Financier says:
The changes in the statement of the Associated
banks 'of New York for the week ending- June
I are almost trivial Compared with the heavy
fluctuations of the past few weeks. It would
seem that the culmination of a number of !m
--liortnnt matters had at last been passed, leav
ing the banks only to report routine operations
of" a comparatively dull week. The two holi
days, coupled with the comparative quietness
in stock exchange for the reiSalnder of the
week, are reflected In the sliÃht changes in the
loan item, but the gain, small as It Is, possi
l>ly indicates that the period of heaviest liqui
dation is over. If this is true there is reason
to believe that some use will be found for ..he
arcumulatlon of surplus funds at this center
and that rates may be maintained at something
like a reasonable figure, although no advance
of any significance is anticipated. The hanks
lost in cash during the week, according to the
statement, $1,134,000, all of which was In specie
Operations with the treasury are known to have
THE SAjST FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY,. JUNE 4, 1899,
resulted In a decrease about as stated, but
no account has been made of a much heavier
gain from the Interior, and the real facts are
that the reserve is heavier than is to be In
ferred from the statement. Deposits remain
almost stationary, so taut the reserve reduction
Is due entirely to the loss In cash. 'The ship
ment of j1.000.000 In gold to Europe does not
figure In the averages. This incident â¢ had no
effect whatever on the money market, as the
transaction 1b understood to have been of " a
special nature. It Is doubtful If. gold in any
quantity will go abroad this summer. Cer
tainly- If the loans of the banks begin to In
crease, exports will be checked unlera there
arises In domestic and foreign markets a situ
ation that now appears Improbable. The banks
ought to continue to Rain from the interior
for some time to come. Tho July disbursements
will "be unusually heavy this year and as there
in nothing that will entail an unusual demand
on the banks It appears that fluctuations In
the money rate will depend solely on a revival
of speculative activity, which now Is regarded
as certain. \

LEGEND
OF THE
GINGHOTREE.
I- India's mystic land
Is the roast of Trincomalee,
Near which; a thousand years ago.
Grew a beautiful Glngho tree.
Its fruit was large and rich and sweet.
Its perfume tinged the air.
And many a traveler, "neath its shade
Would rest the noontide there.
There came a King of the farther East,
Who had journeyed over and through
The mountains high and the vales so deep.
When the Gingho came In view.
"Here will we rest, my weary men;
All praise to God I" said he.
"He has sent us f"or] and wat*r to drink
â  pr< ading tree!"
they pitched their tents,
thankful that they wept;
They ate an.) <lr;.nk most heartily,
And soundly then they alept.
An t!v King awoke,
And In hi- seiiisli brain
Evolved thf thought, "I've no such tr*e
in all my Vast domain.
"I'll have it torn up. root and branch,
And in my garden there

portunity and for quite a distance be
yond the pond could be heard merry
of laughter and the shouts of the
skat- rs. Little Tessle Murray heard
these sounds and longed t" join in
them.

'Now," said Frank to Tim, exult
ingly.
"Now," answered Tim In a hoarse
whisper.
Wheel what a cry little Sing Hop
pet up when he started down the grade
alone! In less than half a minute he
was trio worst-scared boy on tne ra
cific Cirast. The barrel stave fell from
his hands and he clutched both sides
of the coaster. He had a clear course
and a speedy track S] eedy? His flight
down Telegraph Hill will be historic for
at least a year on the hill, which is a
long time for boys to remember any
one thing keenly.
One hundred feet down he found him
self chasing closely a cur dc-g, which
was more scared than he was. "Xi yi!"
yelled the dog.
"Xi yi!" yelled Frank Kelly and Tim
encouragingly.
Tt was a bad day for the '!"j- r . The
coaster ran as if to make a coast record
for speed. Little Sing Hop felt the
wind sweep his face as If it were a hur

His courtiers rose and hurriedly
Prepared to journey on,
And fast of all, to feasi once more,
But lo! the fruil was gone!
The tree had withered in the hour
That daylight Ailed tlit- sk\ ,
And all his men despairingly
Saw, too, the stream was dry!
"Q. King! O. King! the tree is dead!"
< 'ned t hi y In Loud alarm ;
"What evil spirit hath dime this â
Hath dune the Gingho harm?"
The Kins bethought the sin was Ids.
And a voice came from the tree:
"God placed mo here for man and beastâ
But not for such as ye!"
They left the spot; they journeyed on
And on. beyond the plain;
Then from the tree the f"liago sprung
And rich, ripe fruit again!

THE BAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY. JUNE 4, 1899.
coaster, as if racing with it.
The two hoys at the top of the hill
and a passing man saw Sing Hop speed
ing <>n with the fury of a cyclone. Then
came a collision. Another hark was
wreckedâ that is, the coaster hit the
cur dog and threw it into the air with
such force that it turned half a dozen
somersaults before it struck on its feet.
Then the coaster made a sudden curve
and ran right in the direction of the
passing man.
Biff! Crash! The passer is down!
His hat is tossed in the air. His teeth
are jarred. He can hardly realize what
has happened to him.
"Go it, '"hina!" yells Tim from above.
Frank also lends his yell of encourage
ment.
I am sorry to tell what happened
then, hut I must. There was an ash
barrel in the street into which the
ci aster had suddenly turned. Sing Hop
saw it; perhaps the coaster had a
grudge against that barrel. At any
rat< the barrel was in the path. An
oth< r flash Â»f time and the coaster has
Struck the barrel. Then, for the first
lirii'' since he started to "coast," Sing
Hop loses his lurid. The coaster rises
lik.' a skyrocket. Will it never come
down? Sing Hop rises even faster and
falls as suddenly. Head first he strikes
dolls. At fi o'clock Mr.' Murray and
T-M'li.' <;:t]ic- home. When they were
seated at the table .\irs. Murray ran
to Tessle's playhouse i" call h-T to sup
per. To h^r great surprise the play
house was all in confusion, but no lit
tle girl was i" he seen. She ran from
room i" room calling her. Receiving no
answer, she grew alarmed and atartled
her husband and sun by running sud
denly int-r the dining-room.
"What's the matter?" they asked.
' < >h, I can't find Tessle anywhere."
she answi v d. "I'm afraid Bhe has gone
to th( pi nd and been drowned, or some
thing else, oh, dear, dear!"
"Surely Tessle wouldn't have gone,"
paid Mr. Murray. "Why d<> you think
that?"
Th.-n MrÂ«. Murray told how badly
Tessie had felt when she was refused.
IM'iw assured his mother that he had
not seen Tessie at all at the pond.
Mrs. Murray suggested forming a
search party, but her husband Paid
they must search the house first. So,
forgetting suppf-r and all else but their
dear Tessie, they went from room to
room, looking in every corner and
crevice, calling their dear one, then
listening for a reply. Just as they were
examining one of the bedrooms upstairs
a shriek rose on the air. It was Tessie'a
voice and it came from the spare room.
What could have happened? Filled
with th- greatest anxiety, and .hurrying
lest a moment lost should prove fatal.
they reached the door and threw it
open. A little figure sprang from the
liln.r.
"Oh, mamma!" it cried, rushing into
.Mrs. Murray's arms. "I've had the aw
fullest dream!" Mamma claÃped her
pel to her breast with a silent but
heartfelt prayer of thanksgiving. Tes-
Bie t"lil them how she had pone up to
this room to rry and had cried herself
to Bleep. She dreamed that she had
disobeyed mamma and had pone down
to the pond. There she had a fine time
skating.
All of a sudden every one disappeared
;u.'! Bhe was left alone on the pond.
She cried, but no one came to her. She
ran off the icp, 'and immediately the
pond became a great giant. "You have
disobeyed your mother." it said, "and
you must be punished."
"So, mamma," added Tessie, when
Bhe had finished her Btory, "he was
coming t<; eat me when I yelled and
woke up. Oh, I am bo glad I didn't
disobey you and go to the pond."
"So am I, dear. I hope you never
will, for a bad end always comes to a
child whu is disobedient."

PUZZLERS AND WRITERS.
ONK of tho puzzles presented this
morning was designed by one of
our young friendsâ Jennie R.
Pulsifer of South Vallejoâ *nd it
is numbered 2. When ycm have
guessed the answer try to do as well.
Perhaps you can. There was more fun
than a little last week when the an-
Bwers to puzzle No. 7 were looked over.
Many children found that the answer
>\;is tomato (Torn-ate-o) â but there
were others who found that the an-
Bwer was u-m-ate-o and letters (let
in- â¢ ) and tomato and catsup. These
Ingenious children ought to be coneid
ered as doubly honorary and would be
bo oredited if there were any way to
indicate the fact in the Roll of Honor;
but it is much to get o-n the Roll, as
may be seen by the comparatively small
number enrolled. The answers to the
puzzli s appearing last Sunday morn-
Ing are as follows: Nectarine, cookies,
dumpling, butter, bologna, sugar, to
mato. This morning we have some
California towns not named in the puz
-3l( b before. The towers are getting few
that arc available for puzzle making.
But there are many familiar objects,
and these will let us keen right along
with ii:" pictorial puzzles for some time.
How would it do to tell you a short
:t 'TV -very short, of courseâin that
way' some Sunday morning soon? That
will lie n< w. Look out for the pictorial
Btory. The usual list of our guess
â¢ rs who deserve honorary mention, al
though not on the Roll of Honor this
\v. < k. is as follows:
Anna Vnlkinann, 514 Castro street, Rnn
Francisco; Veatino Smith, 227 Montealm
street, San Francisco; Amy Robinson,
1016 East Sixteenth street. East Oakland;
in the ba-rrel. which is not very strong.
There has never been a barrel that
could stand such a shock and come out
as good as new. Sing Hop acts like a
battering ram. A Chinese laundry
man's horse that sees this part o-f the
scene runs away in fright.' The cur
dog thinks that Sing is after him again
and flees with his tail between his legs,
howling dismally.
You may not believe it, but Sing Hop
broke through the side of the barrel,
which was nearly empty. There were
just enough old cabbage leaves In the
bottom of the barrel to save his life by
furnishing a soft cushion for him t'->
strike upon.
"He's killed!" yells Tim in horror.
"Sure!" is the fearful answer of
Frank.
The two white boys ran to a place of
hiding, thinking that they already hear
the policeman on the beat chasing after
them.
Sing Hop managed to get out of the
barrel. A Chinese laundryman, after
he had caught his runaway horse, came
to his rescue. Sing Hop had a ride
homeward in the laundry wagon. He
no more cares to play with the two
white hoys, nor has h* ever been known
to play hookey since. They say that
they cured him of the bad habit.

NATURE'S RED ROSES WERE COAXED
TO BLOOM UPON A CHILD'S PALE CHEEKS
IT was a fine summer morning and the old farmhouse looked beautiful, with
the honeysuckles climbing up on the kitchen windows. The roos.ters were
crowing and the hens were clucking in the farm yard. The good old house
cat lay stretched out on the front porch in the sunshine. The growing
grain and the flowers waved gently to and fro in the soft wind.
In a big hospital, in a large, hot city a little girl lay on a white cot. She
was- sick, but the doctor said that if she could go Into the country, and get out
among the hay and flowers, and take long country drives, she would get well
and color would come back to her cheeks. Her parents were poor. They had
barely enough to keep her in the hospital. If she should go alone to the country
she would be among strangers. So it seemed that she -would not get the change
that she needed.
One day a farmer and his wife came to the city to sell butter. They owned
a nice farmhouse. When they had sold their butter they went to the hospital
and there saw this little girl. .She was asleep, but they could Bee that she was
pretty, and both fancied her and asked the doctor about her. The farmer went
to see her mother while his wife remained in the hospital to await his return.
The farmer was surprised when he visited the mother's house to see how
neat it was. He had been told that the mother was poor and he had expected tu
find the house dirty. He had another surprise when he saw the mother. She
was a nice little woman. She had no fine clothes, but her dress was neat. She
said "Come in!" in a pleasant voice and took the farmer into the parlor and
asked him to sit down. He told- her why he had come and talked a long time
with the mother.
Meanwhile the doctor and the farmer's wife talked at th<=> hospital and Ethel
awoke and looked around. She had just paid that she would likf to go to the
country when her mother and the farmer came in. Ethel was told that she
could go, and soon she was in the surrey and on her way to the farm. They had
a pleasant ride and a pleasant talk. Pretty s .on they came to the farm. Ethel
was given a nk'e room and when she was ready she had dinner.
Ethel has been on the farm now about a year. She does not look like the
girl who was pick in the hospital. Her parents will soon move to the country.
Ethel wears a little white pinafore sometimes. She looks very nice.
Among the toys that Christmas brought her was a box of paints. She
thought that she would paint a rose red. She did this very well. That night,
as Dame Nature was looking over the flowers, she noticed that the painted rose
looked very pretty. The next morning Ethel found that there were red roses
where there had been only white roses before. Ethel thinks that Dame Nature
heard her wish that there might b? more red ropes and that Nature so painted
them to make a little girl happy. Perhaps Nature did. for the new red roses are
on Ethel's cheek?. BEATRICE ST'RRHYUE.

TOM And Retta and Marjory,
Held by the rainy weather
Threi 1 prisoners fast, make up at
last
The jolliest game together,
For they pose as "living pictures"
In the nursery corner, playing
It's either a stage or a circus cage
Or a word with fairies straying.
Then the wonderful lion tamer.
Where chairs kept safe each growling
And savage beastâ l know at least
One throat was sore with howlingâ
But Marjory calmly tamed them
With a tennis racket, tapping
Each furry head till they begged, instead.
She'd feed and lea\-e them napping.
But the fjre.it parade of the circus
Is the funniest thing-, for walking
In twos along the animals throng.
The elephant oven talking;
Why. you'd think a dozen monkeys
Some show were kindly lending";

Dear Editor: I will write to tell you
about the club which was organized on
The History of the Father of His Country Made Trouble.
JOHNNY had been a good boy for
a Ion? time and received from his
teacher a book on the life of George
Washington. He read the book
over until he came to the part
where George Washington rut down
the cherry tree and never got whipped.
So Johnny thought ha would try and
cut down his father's tree and he said
to himself when he went to get the
hatchet: "Of course I won't get
So Retta smiles as Beauty sweet.
While Tom. the B^ast, quite gravely
With a mighty hug and a wolf skin rug
Makes love and faces bravely.
But you'd laugh to see his Bluebeard
With a yellow turban nodding.
And bluing streaks on his rosy cheeks
From whiskers of cotton wadding.
Then up in a big clothes basket
On the high sea's raging billows
Drifts fair Elaine, who'll be. it's plain
Soon swamped in sofa pillows.
Next, Indian Pocahontas
In beads and feathers mainly.
Poor Smith to save from Tom, who gavift
His "hatchet act" too plainly.

Will two writers furnish their ad

entitled "The Enchanted Lake"; the other
wrote "Foxey." The authors failed to
place their names on their manuscripts.
THE TALK OF THE TREES.
I THINK," said Little Nell, "that
everything that lives has a lan
guage of its ownâ even the flowers
and the trees, and now if you will
listen I will tell you a short story
about some proud young, jealous trees.
"Away off in the country there is a
group of trees, and this is what they
said to a poor old broken-down hollow
tree:
" 'If only a woodman would come
along and take you homely old shriv
eled up thing away! You are really
disgusting.'
"But little thought these hateful
young trees what a help this old dis
gusting thing as they called it would
pome day be to any one. Days and
weeks passed by in the same dismal
way for this old hollow tree.
"But one dark dreary night a little
wandering child came by shivering
with the cold. She looked up at these
tall jealous trees and said to herself,
'What ugly straight trees these are.'
"Then finally she glanced around and
saw the old tree and said, "Oh, what a
lovely tree,' and then she ran to it for
shelter.
"The young trees were so jealous
afterward that they never said any
thing to the old trep again."

whipped because George Washington
didn't."
The tree was soon chopped down and
he went into the house and his father
said: "Johnny, my boy, who cut down
papa's cherry tree?" Johnny said:
"Father. I cut it down with my little
hatchet."
"You did, " said the father, "then I
will whip you." So Johnny was fooled.

Luck in the
Finger Nails
IN early times it was considered that
bad luck would certainly attend any
person who neglected to either burn or
bury the parings of his finger nails.
Among the Hebrews it was the custom
to pare the nails on a Friday, and the
operation had to be conducted in a cer
tain manner. The little finger on the loft
hand had first to bdoperated on, then the
middle finger, followed by the fourth
finger, thumb Mid forefinger. The nail
of the middle finger of the right hand
had next to be cut; then came the thumb,
then the forefinger and afterward the
fourth and little finger.
When fortune telling was more in vogue
than at present the shape and appearance
of the finger nails were looked on as hav
ing reference to one's destiny. The nails
were first; rubbed over with a mixture of
wax and soot, and, after being tnus pre-
Fared, were held so that the sunlight fell
ull upon them. On the horny, transpar
ent substance were supposed to appear
signs and characters from which the fu
ture could be interpreted.
Persons, too, with certain descriptions
of nails were supposed to possess certain
characteristics. For instance, a man with
red and spotted nails was of a fiery, hot
tempered disposition, while pale, lead
colored nails denoted a melancholy tem
perament.
Ambitious and quarrelsome people were
distinguished by narrow nails, while lov
ers of knowledge and liberal sentiment
had round-shaped nails.
Conceited, obstinate and narrow-minded
persons were possessed of small nails;
lazy, indolent individuals of fleshy nails,
and those of a gentle, timid nature of
broad nails.
Those persons whose nails grow into the
flesh at the sides are generally luxurious
ly Inclined, while those with very pale
nails are subejct to both bodily and men
tal suffering.â Woman's Life.
