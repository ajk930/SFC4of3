Distance Travel.
j \J Mr. and Mrs. June 28.â
Mr. and Mrs. John D.
Davis will start from this
city in a motor carriage bound
for San Francisco on Saturday,
July i. ' .It will be the longest au

sides requiring endurance, skill
and nerve, it. will be the test of
â an American-made self-propell

Nothing to compare with the
trip has ever been attempted in
this country, where the sport
termed â  "automobihsm is yet
in its infancy. In- Europe the

stretches of road in the East, and
some fair roads in the Middle
West; but he will have to follow
â  stage coach routes through the
Rocky Mountains and the cattle
trail used by the forty-niners

I he progress of Mr. Davis and
his wife in their automobile will
be reported in the San Francisco

across the country described.
If Mr. Davis succeeds in reaching
his destination according to pro
gramme he believes thai his trip
will demonstrate the possibilities
of long distance touring, even in
the absence of good roads, and
-should be a strong argument in
favor of the improvement of the
main highways of this country.

JULY 11TH CANNOT BE CELEBRATED IN IDAHO

the local men of prominence. This year,
in view of the persecution practiced
on members of the Miners' Union, it
was not proposed to generally observe
the day. The wives and daughters of
â¢rimers had. however, intended to
place flowers on the grave?, as for
merly, but their intention becoming
known to Attorney General Sinclair,
the following proclamation was issued
to-day:

what is described by the makers
a.s a "continental touring cart."
It has been built in Stamford,
( '<-nn.. by the National Motor
Company, specially for this trip
to San Francisco. Its parts are.
stronger than in the same types
of vehicle made for use on id
roads, and everything has been
dene to insure safety and com
fort on so long a journey. A
_.-"line motor concealed in a
box beneath the seat furnishes
the power, and sufficient fuel can
be carried to run 240. miles.
Mr. Davis expects to have no
number of residents of Phoshone Coun
ty propose to celebrate on July 11 cer
tain acts committed in violation of
law and order and to incite rioting and
resistance to the laws of the State and
the f'nited States, now, therefore, this
is to notify all persons that no

ply of gasoline in the cities and
more important towns through
which he may pass. The carriage
has three gears, giving three
different speeds of ten. twenty
five and thirty-five miles an
hour. It is said to able to climb
a 25 per cent grade at the rate of
five miles an hour. Mr. Davis
expects to maintain an average
speed of fifteen miles an hour for
the entire distance, doing better
in the East than west of the Mis
sissippi.
The start will be made from
the Herald building, in this city.
In the removal rase against County
Commissioners Simpson and Boyle this
morning, the defense filed an answer
denying that they knowingly or cor
ruptly performed any material acts
charged in the information, but alleged
that all their official acts as County
Commissioners were performed in the
best Interests of the people of Sho
shone County and without profit to
themselves. The State offered in evi
dence the record of the Commissioners,
showing the number of votes cast on a
proposition of the removal of the coun
ty seat from Murray to Wallace: also
a certificate of the result filed with the
County Recorder, and vouchers for al
lowances made Sheriff Young as com
missions on license collections.
The afternoon was spent by the State
in presenting evidence in the case.
Most of the time was spent examining
witnesses regarding the bonds of the
Sheriff, Assessor and Tax Collector.
and the finish will be at the San
Francisco Call building. In
choosing the route good roads
have been the firsi consideration.
and so little is known here of the
condition of the roads we^t of
Denver that Mr. Davis may
change his plans when he reaches
the Rockies. From this city he
will run up the Hudson Valley
to Albany, where his road turns
to the westward, following- the
course of the Mohawk River.
Passing through Utica, Syra
cuse and Rochester, the route
then leads around the south
shore of Lake Erie, through
RIOTERS IN STREETS OF BRUSSELS
CHARGED BY THE POLICE.
HURRYING GENDARMES FROM THE PROVINCES.
BRUSSELS, June 2S.â A disturb
ance occurred in the Chamber of
Deputies to-day when the order
of the day of the Right was
adopted, expressing confidence in
the president of the house against the
vote of Socialists. The announcement
of the vote was the signal for a general
uproar, all the Deputies rushing to the
center of the floor, where a free fight
took place. M. Guchtenacre, Catholic-
Labor member from Ghent, was badly
beaten by Socialists. A guard of sol
diers on duty finally cleared the gal
leries and the session was suspended.
The Minister of War. M. J. H. P. Van
den Peereboom, was the object of great
abuse by the Socialists, who blamed
him for originating the uproar.
BRUSSELS, June 29, 1 a. m.â At a
late hour demonstrators assembled in
the neighborhood of Parliament House,
the Government offices and the palace,
Cleveland and Toledo and across
Indiana to South Bend, and
thence to Chicago.
Leaving Chicago the route
will be across* the prairies to the
Mississippi River at Davenport,
and due west to Dcs Moines.
The ' Missouri River will be
crossed at Omaha, and the
course will be southwest through
Nebraska and on to Denver.
Mr. Davis expects to take the
pass near Boulder, Colo., and
work through the mountains,
going to the north of the (ireat
American Desert and turning
south after passing Palisade,
all of which were protected by the
police. The efforts of the latter and of
the civic guard to disperse the people
were fruitless. Finally a mounted body
of gendarmes repeatedly charged the
croud, greatly incensing the demon
strators, who hurled stones and other
missiles at the gendarmes, who there
upon discharged their revolvers. This
failed to scatter the crowd and the
gendarmes finally charged with fixed
bayonets and drawn swords. Two
gendarmes and several rioters were
wounded and many arrests were made.
Numerous windows and street lamps
were smashed and the scuffling con
tinued until after midnight, when. a
heavy fall of rain dispersed the demon
strators.
At the hour of filing this dispatch the
streets are still held by the police and
civil guards and detachments of the
gendarmes are arriving from the pro
vinces.

again in the late afternoon
and early evening. Accommoda
tions will b-e sought at hotel- and
road inns until the plains are
reached, and then Mr. and Mrs.
Davis will put up at ranches over
night. In the mountains a tent
may be used for camping out in
case it is found that roadhouses
arc lacking. (iood roads maps
of the League of American
Wheelmen will be consulted in
all States in which they have
been issued. Mr. Davis ha< had I
some experience on the plains. 'â¢
but with all of his efforts to
gather information concerning
the roads, he admits that for a
long stretch in the Far West they
are an unknown quantity to him.
He is determined, however, to
get through to the coast in the
shortest possible running time,
and is confident of arrival there
early in August.
PACKING HOUSE STRIKES
CONSIDERED AT AN END
CHICAGO. June 28.â Wifh the exception
of the trouble at the Vilas & Robbing
plant, where about 500 men ami boys re
fused to work to-day, the epidemic of
strikes at the packing houses appears to
be at an end. In every plant notices have
been posted warning employes that any
one quitting work before the regular hour
would be discharged. The notices wco
the result of a conference held by the
packers on Tuesday and were effectual in
putting an end to the strikes.
Morris & Co. claim to be running aU
right, but despite the claims of th-- firm
thai it has replaced all its striking em
ployes, it has only been killing less than
half the usual number of hogs. The
strike center has jumped frcm the yards
to the plant of Vilas & Robbing at the
Halstead street bridge of the Chicag .
River. The killing gang and unskilled
laborprs went, out and operations j?er<
suspended. About 500 men and boys are
involved in the strike. They demand the
restoration of the 1593 scale.

Assessor Berkey of Sacramento Coun
ty Starts a Crusade on Fruit-
Sliipping Companies.
SACRAMENTO, .Tune 2S.â Assessor
Berkey of this county has announced his
â  â â rmination to assess tliÂ» refrigerator
cars of the larg". fruit shipping compa
nies, which, it is claimed, have heretofore
; ed taxation. In accordance with this
design, the Assessor this afternoon caused
to appear before him C. B. Dewees, secre
j tary of the Continpntal Fruit Express.
: whom he subjected to a series of ques
tions relative to what numbers of re
frigerator cars of the company he repre
were located in this county on
March 1 last. Dewees said that the state
ment which he had previously rendered
the Assessor was correct, so far as he
knew. This statement made it appear
that the only property of the Continental
Fruit Express in Sa--rn.mento County on
March 1 last was as follows: Office furnl
; Hire, $7.'; safe and fixtures, $50: ice house
; $250; total, $875. He said he knew of no
way to o'etermine where the cars of his
company were on March 1. He said he did
not know whether or not his company
taxes in this State on its cars. He
; added that he did not know in what State
such taxes were paid, or whether they
were paid at all; that was outside his line
ol business.
After some further questioning, which
elicited no important information," the rep
resentative was excused. The agents of
! the other refrigerator car lines will be
called at different dates and similarly
questioned. Assessor Berkey said that no
matter what county of the State the cars
are located in he proposes to see that they
â do not escape taxation. He says that he
j has learned that most of the fruit-grow
ers express. cars were in Los Angeles on
March 1 and that he will notify the
Assessor of that county of that fact.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JUNE 29. 1899.
CONFINED IN A
MEXICAN JAIL ON
A MURDER CHARGE
H. C. Faulkner, an Engineer,
Formerly of Redwood City,
Being Persecuted.
REDWOOD CITY. June 28.â A sensa
tional letter has Just been received by J.
j V. Swift of this place from H. C. Faulk
; ncr, who is confined in Jail at Ixtlahuaca.
Mexico. Mr. Faulkner has been confined
since April 25 last in a cell Bxlo feet, along
j with eight' other prisoners, the latter of
i the lowest type. The charge against him
is murder, and grew out of a most
lamentable accident, which occurred at
the Nolan mine at El Oro, where he was
employed as engineer, for which he was
entirely blameless.
It appears that the superintendent of
the mine together with an employe were
j let down a shaft in the mine in a cage,
their object being to take the water level.
Before going down the engineer was given
instructions to stop on signal.
The cage was lowered and no signal
I given to stop. Finally Faulkner thought,
! from the indicator,' that the cage must
be near the water, and of his own accord
stopped it. He received no signal even
then, and as It was against the rules to
raise the cage without orders from be
j low, he sent a man down to investigate,
who reported that the top of. the cage
was under water. The men had been
drowned like rats in a trap.
The letter, which was dated the lPth
inst., was smuggled out of prison and 13
as follows:
Dear Friend: You will no doubt be surprised
to hear that I am down here, and more than
that, I am In jail and unjustly held by the
authorities for an accident which occurred on
the 25th of last April at the Nolan mine at
El Oro, where I was employed. The casualty
resulted in the death of two men, and al
though I am entirely blameless, I have been
thrown into, prison at this place and have
since if confined In a cell not larger than
Bxlo with eight prisoners of the lowest type
j Imaginable. There is no ventilation and the
j stench of the place is terrible. My friends
i have done all they could to secure a trial for
I me, but have not yet succeeded, and it Eeenis
; all I can do is to Walt in silence in this hor
; rible place, for God knows when I will get out.
: The lood given us is not tit tor a dog, and
I what makes it harder still is that my health
' is about ruined from Bleeping on the damp ,
y stone flQgr, Ji -_.vfi\ili! jyu^Uje strongest, njej;.
' so you can imagine the cruelty iff. these Mexi
cans, especially when they have an American
!in their power. If the authorities would only
investigate the charges made against me they
; would at once see that I was powerless to pre
i vent the accident, or to save the lives of the
'â¢ men.
I will tell you briefly how the accident oc
curred, and every word of my statement can
i be proved by the most unimpeachable testimony
in the town of El Oro: I was running the
: hoisting engine at the Nolan mine, and on â¦he
i date mentioned the superintendent. Frank
Lloyd, stepped into the cage to descend, ac
: companied by a peon, to take the water level,
I giving me orders to lower -him until he sig
, naled me to stop. I let the cable out until
the cage had reached the 600-foot level and
' then slowed down to allow them to take the
bell rope. I still kept on paying out the cable,
expecting every moment to get the signal, but
no sign was given. The indicator showed that
! the cage had reached the end of the guides so
j I stopped and waited lor the signal, but re
! ceived none. I could not hoist the cage without
orders, so I Bent men down the main way of
the shaft to find out what was wrong, and
! when they returned they told me that the cage
was under water and both men were drowned.
My friends have appealed to the American
i Embassador at the City of Mexico, but he
| would do nothing for me. I have forwarded
i a statement to Secretary Hay at Washington
and hope he will Investigate the matter and
have my case investigated. I Intend to try
and make the Mexican Government pay for
their unjust and cruel treatment.
I write this letter principally to warn my
friends In Redwood who may think of com
ing to this country what they may expect
from such laws as exist here. I hope this
communication may reach you, yet I fear that
it never will. I have to depend upon the kind
ness of a prisoner who has the run of the
yard to address and mall it for me. I want
LEADS UP TO A
FORGERY CHARGE
Sensation Sprung in a
Petty Civil Case.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDDING, June 28.â A sensation was
sprung in the trial of a petty civil case
before Judge Cunningham at Balls terry
to-day. It will result in a prosecution for
forgery of W. Ford Spencer, a prominrnt
farmer, or his wife, or both. Suit was
brought by Mrs. Spencer in the Jutftic-'j
Court of Shlnpletown Township against
Joseph and Antone Martin to prove i
debt of $178, including a note for $25. The
Martins are widely known and respectc-d
sheep men. During the trial to-day
Colonel C. A. Garter, ex-United States
District Attorney, as attorney for the de
fendants, demanded to see the promis
sory note, denying I,he existence of the
samp. To the amazement of the defence
a note for $25, payable to Mrs. Spencer
and signed with the name, of Joseph
Martin, was produced. Martin was
dumfounded and stoutly denied the au
thorship of the note.
Judge Cunningham stopped the trial
and announced hi.s Intention of taking
proofs on the authenticity of the promis
sory note. A continuance was taken in
the case until July 10, at which -time both
sides of the case will have handwriting
experts up from San Francisco to pass
on the- note. The Spencers are known
throughout the State. Mrs. Spencer was
a witness on the Yon Tiedeman forgery
case in San Francisco recently. Spencer
himself ia best known in this county by
the numerous times that his name adoiiifc

courts. ____________
MRS. LETERBANDT WINS.
She Gets $4500 to xieal a Heart
Broken by Jean Sorg.
SAN JOSE. June 28.-Mrs. Bertha Lieb
brandt was given a verdict against Miner
Jean Sorg this afternoon for $4500 ' for
breach of promise ' of marriage. Thirty
thousand dollars were asked in the suit,
but the little bathhouse proprietress of
the Surf City evinced considerable pleas
ure when the verdict was read. The jury
was only out a couple of hours. A ten
days' stay was granted and the case will
undoubtedly go to the Supreme Court. â¢
The verdict hinged solely on the testi
i mony of Mrs. LelDbrandt and Sorg. The
plaintiff testified Sorg was an ardent

In addition to his letter Mr. Faulkner

It bad been stated by Mr. Faulkner's
â persecutors that the "indicator on the
engine showed him plainly that the cage
was from fifteen to twenty feet below the
water line," while the truth is. and it can
be established by unimpeachable testi
mony, that the top of the cage was sub
j merged in but six inches of water.
-Mr. Lloyd before starting down loosen
i ed the needle of the indicator on the en
; gine that the engineer might Ret it in the
proper place on the indicator when he
should receive signal to do so. Mr. Lloyd
! marked a spot on the indicator to which
I the engineer with perfect safety might
' lower him.
The engineer lowered him inch by inch,
waiting for Mr. Lloyd's signal. Befojy
reaching the spot on the indicator mark
; ed by Mr. Lloyd he stopped the c aKe cn _

"When the night engineer Arrived he did
not immediately hoist the cage, as stated,
but they decided to send a man down the
ladder, which Is In a chamber parallel to
that in which the cage runs, to see if all
were well, as *- iC (Faulkner) had begun
to be anxious.

In the clipping sent.it is said:
In none of the reports la the reason given
to the public why the engineer heeded not the
Blgnals of heard them not. Why? Because
there were never any given. It Is claimed
that the engine was* in good running order,
the boll rope and bell Intact. Verily, the en
gineer himself admits that this time the en

it certainly was intact, colled up and thrown on
one â¢â¢! the timbers of the mine, well out of
reach of the occupants bf the cage when near

be mure Bpeclflc. Why was it there? HecauÃe
on a previous trip it had become entangled in
Mr. Lloyd's legs and he himself had thrown the
end of it over one of the timbers, a fact the
engineer did not know till a week after the
accident, and which Mr. Lloyd deemed so un
important that apparently he forgot all about
It.
As for the engineer not using any Judgment.
this Is all twaddle. An engineer on a hoist
ing machine is not supposed to operate the

tice of using Judgment instead of signals
mines would be the scenes of even more acci
dents than they are. His signals are his or

and implicitly as the soldier who receives nis
orders from his officer and obeys without ask

that a cage shall never be lowered nor raised,
once it has been stopped, without the proper
signalftbeing given.

MANILA, June 28.â One of the most
prominent Filipinos in Manila received
a verbal message this morning direct
from Aguinaldo, who is at Tarlac. in
structing him to make as complete a
report as possible regarding both the
military and political situation in Ma
nila, Aguinaldo wants to obtain from
a Filipino source knowledge concerning
the strength of the American army, the
health of the troops, and what Otis'
intent;,, 7>s ,:;-e regarding the carrying
out of operations u^rillg U\e rainy sea
son.
.The Filipino to whom the message
was sent has been steadfastly friendly
to the Americans. He has been fre
quently requested to join Aguinaldo,
but always refused to do so.
The fact that the rebel leader has
sent such a request is capable of dou
ble interpretation. Possibly Aguinaldo
desires to know what his chances
would be in the event of his surrender,
or it. is possible that he wants to obtain
information as to ports opened by or
der of General Otis, through which he
might obtain provisions and other sup
i plieÃ for his army and at the same time
' ship the produce of tne country.
The request for the information,
coming as it does direct from Agui
naldo, settles the reports that have
been circulated to the effect that he
has been assassinated by the friends of
General Luna, in revenge for the kill
| ing of the latter by some of Aguinaldo's
j men, presumably by his order.
Under General Otis' instructions the
! gunboats engaged in blockading duty
â¢ now allow vessels with regular clear
j ance papers to pass the blockade, but
; the issuing of an order to this effect
I was delayed, owing to the fact that the
j opening of ports would enable the in
surgents, who are in control of them, to
collect duties on articles imported.
There was great distress at several of
i the closed ports, owing to the lack if
! food, and business was at a complete
I standstill, owing to the merchants be
â  ing unable to obtain supplies.
These facts influenced General Otis
to issue the order, he considering that
I the situation is now sufficiently favor
j able to permit restricted business being
done at the ports. The order simply
permits the landing of food, and a clO3e
watch will be kept to prevent filibus
ters from landing arms, ammunition
and other supplies for rebels.
A severe typhoon is blowing arid this
is delaying the sailing of vessels which
â v^ant to take advantage of the opening
of the ports. The situation remains
comparatively quiet to the south and
east of Manila, where recent lighting
took place. A rebels' scouting party
to-day met a patrol of the Wyoming
regiment, and in seeking escape, fled
Into the arms of a battalion of the
Fourth Infantry. Two of the insur
gents were capturpd with their arms.
There is increasing activity among
j the Insurgents at San Fernando, and
i they apparently are anxious to resume
' hostilities. It is reported to-day that
j General Pio del Pilar, with 200 D men,
has joined the main body of the insur
gents there.

EXEMPTS REFUSE TO
MARCH WITH CHINESE
Veteran Firemen of Stockton May
Not Participate in the Fourth
of July Parade.
STOCKTON, June 2S.â Discord has
broken out among the exempt firemen
over the action of the Fourth of July
committee in inviting__ local Chinese to
contribute, a feature to the parade. The
local exempts are comprised of influential
citizens, and on parade they are always
one of the best features in a local pro
cession. Ben F. Kohlberg, president of
the company, announces that sinre the
Chinese have been asked to join in the
celebration and are preparing to do so
he wili fall a meeting of the company
and do ail in his power to keep the oid
vets out of lire.
"It think a man whp will turn, out with
a Chinaman is a Chinaman himself," says
Mr Kohlberg. "A few years ago we
were trying to get rid of the Chinese, and
now we are asking them, to turn out la
our patriotic celebrations."
Numbers of other exempts express
themselves the same way. The Fourth of
July committee Is left in a bad fix. It
does not like to notify the Chinese 'that
they cannot parade after extending them
a pressing invitation and can hardly daie
to offend the exempts. Diplomacy is be
ing tried, but it is doubtful whether it
â¢will work in this Instance.
WANTS MONOPOLY OF TRADE.
Mountain Copper Company's System
of Forcing Its Currency Into
Circulation. â¢.
REDDING, ..June' -25.â 111-feeling has
been caused at Keswick by the action of
the Mountain Copper Company in issu
ing currency of its own. The copper com
pany. which operates great smelters, also
has a large-store at Keswick. When an
employe applies at the office for money
. before .payday; he js given funds in the
Ktnley has definitely decided to increase
the military forres in the Philippines to
at least 40.000 men. This decision was
reached at a conference tin's morning be
tween the President, Secretary Algfr and I
Adjutant General Oorbin. The details as
to the organization of additional regi- !
ments and appointment of officers are
matters for future consideration. The only :
order which the President has given on '
! the subject is that recruiting shall con
| tinue at all of the present recruiting sta
tions until further orders. The 65.000 quota
for regulars has already been exceeded, !
so that new recruits will have to be
charged to the provisional army of So.O'JO
! men.
Word was received from General Otis
to-day that he had a skeleton organiza
tion for two volunteer regiments in the
| Philippines, but he did not state the rium
: ber of men he required. He has been
asked for a statement of the exact num
ber that he will need to complete
these two regiments and till up the com
panies of the regular regiments under his
command. When he replies the depart
ment will decide as to the exact number
â  of additional volunteers to be enlisted.
â  The general idea now is that about IT. .<kmj
volunteers will be enlisted and a sufficient
number sent to t ha-. Philippines to increase
; General < >tis' force to 40,000 men. This will
alloy. ]iim a large margin over the mirn
tier he requestedâ 3o ,000â for invalids,
wounded and other non-combatants.
Recruits will be enlisted without \: r e".
for the next two weeks. By that time it
is expected that a sufficient number will
have been obtained to fill two volunteer
regiments being organized by Otis, and
fiye to seven additional regiments in this
j country. The selection of officers for ad
ditional regiments is an embarrassing fea
ture in connection with the organization
of new regiments. This, more than any
other thing, has delayed the decision as
to recruiting more men. Thousands of
applications for commissions are already
on file in the War and- they
continue to pour in in great number.
Realizing that he is likely to make more ;
enemies than friends by the appointments;
In- makes, the President would like to I
shift the responsibility upon other shoul- |
ders. if it were possible to do so.
Officers for two volunteer regiments '
will be appointed <>n the recommendation
of General Otis. In selecting officers for ,
I the regiments to be organized in this j
country, the President's intention is to !
be guided largely by efficiency reports on
those officers, regulars and volunteers,
who participated in the war in Cuba and
Porto Rico, but there is such great pres
sure in behalf of men who did not nave J
an opportunity to display their qualities
last year that the President will find it i
very difficult to confine his selections to
those who fought in the West Indies.
FILIPINOS ACTIVE IN
SOUTHERN ISLANDS
VICTORIA, B. C, June 28.â The steam
ers Tartar and Glenogle arrived to-day
from Hongkong, bringing an interesting
story from Hakodate, where the steamer
Hokoku Maru had just returned from the
Philippines. Her master. Captain Kawa
mura Sakichi, reported that in the south
ern islands the young Filipinos are con
structing fortifications against emergen
cies. Every port is garrisoned by a thou
sand or so volunteers, whoge weapons,
however, are very crude, only about 20 per
cent being armed with rifles (Reming
tons). They are, however, full of pa
triotism and state that they will not yield
to the Americans, though the whole cf
the islands are destroyed. The photo
graphs of Aguinaldo are to be seen on the
walls of all the huts in the camps, and
his influence is great.
The Hokoku Alaru was warmly wel
comed by the Filipinos, who considered
the Japanese to be of a kindred race and
hoped for assistance from them. The
officers in the camps entertained the
ship's officers and crew, and endeavored
to make arrangements for a supply of
arms and ammunition from Japan, for
which they said they were prepared to
pay a large sum of money. They further
stated that they could supply large quan
tities of hemp as a return cargo for
Japanese vessels visiting the islands. The
Hokoku is believed to have done a prob
able trade in Remingtons and ammuni
tion, but her master naturally denies the
charge, asserting that all he sold were
two revolvers and the cook's knives.
There was no question but that the in
surgents are well supplied with gold coin
| shape of aluminum checks in denomina
j tions of 10. 25 and 50 cents, good for mer
chandise at the company's store. Saloon
Keepers and others- are forced to accept
these checks or lose trade. The checks
can be redeemed only by purchasing at
the company's store. Business men of
Keswick are complaining and are trying
to devise some means to obviate the ne
cessity of accepting the aluminum checks

NEWCASTLE, June 28.â The fruit
growers met in Fraternal Hall at 3
i o'clock this afternoon. The attendance
was very small. C. H. Kellogg was ap
! pointed chairman and G. Geraldson see
, retary. W. R. Fountain suggested a
I rereading of the articles of incorpora
tion, stating that many growers were
: laboring under a false impression of the
sense of the Placer County association,
Bupposing that it did not favor an in
dependent car line. Mr. Fountain said:
"We wish it distinctly understood
that we do favor sucK a car line and
. will assist the State organization in
this regard. Although my proposition
was voted down in the State conven
tion I do not feel sore over it and am
â  willing to stand In on the majority re
port. Let me say, however, that if by
owning or leasing the refrigerator cars
every cent of th" refrigeration charges
were removed, the fruit growers would
secure one-tenth of one per cent
â¢>! it, but would exactly add to his
losses every dollar of the money he in
vested in the purchase or lease, main
tenance and operating expenses of the
1 refrigerator car line.
'Trace back and see if you can find
one instance wherein a reduction in
transportation charges brought the
growers any increase in their proceeds.
The trouble lies in having the other fel
low do your business. Fellow-growers,
do your own business and own a re
frigerator-car line and you will then be
the painer."
F. C. Miles referred to the actions of'
the State directors, and said that other
districts were prepared to follow Placer
and help the State association. After
considerable debate on what the future
actions would be, the proposition of
Wells, Fargo & Co. was mentioned by
J. F. Maden, but it was decided that
the proposition could not be properly
dealt with at present. An incorporation
was effected and W. R. Fountain, G. L.
Threlkel. C. H. Kellogg. C. L. Adams
and G. Geraldson were elected trustees.

COLUMBIA AGAIN
BEATS DEFENDER
Race From Brentons
Reef to New London.
SHOWS WINDWARD POINTS
ENTHUSIASTIC OVER EXHIBI
TION OF THE NEW BOAT.
The Weather Was Very Bad, but the
Columbia Floated Like a
Cork on Heavy
Seas.
Eueeial Dispatch to The Call.
NEW LONDON, June 2S.â ln a thir
ty-mile beat to windward to-day, the
new yacht Columbia heat th>' old cup
champion, Defender, eight minutes, be
sides giving her a two-minute handi
cap. Yachtsmen from New York and
hereabouts are jubilant, for the yacht's
Bterling qualitie must come out in a
race to windward. The race was from
Brentons Reef Lightship, off Newport,
to New London, a good thirty-eight
miles. The Defender was given a two
minute start. Thirty-two miles "f the
long stretch of water was a beat t"
windward, with bu< b a stiff breeze
blowing that neither yacht cared to
.any a working topsail, and it was in
this "kind ft' work that the Columbia
pained such a lons lead, averaging
nmn than a quarter of a minute faster
each mile than the Defender. Tha
water was very rough, but the new
boat rode very easily, and did not buffet
tlu- waves as much as the Defender.
A stifl breeze from the southwest kick
ed up quite a squall outside this morn
ing and put white crests on the waves
in tlu- inner harbor. The Defender
hoisted anchor shortly after 10 o'clock
and ran down the east passage under
her jib. Her mainsail was hoisted on
the way out and Captain Rhodes sawed
down as far as Castle Hill to get a look
at the weather outside and knocked
about the bay while awaiting the Co
lumbia.
The crew of the Columbia hauled
anchor at 11:15 o'clock, and she was
towed down as far as Castle Hill,
where the hawser was cast off and the
yacht beat out to sea under three lower
sails. The Defender was inside Bren
tons Reef lightship, loafing along under
a jib and mainsail waiting for her
rival. There was a pretty heavy sea,
and as the two yachts plunged along
clouds of spray were thrown into the
air from under their bows and fell
away to leeward. The weather was
rather threatening at the start and a
light rain compelled the crews of the
two yachts to don thir oilskins. The
showers were not heavy, but lasted
nearly all day. The Columbia ran up
to the Defender rapidly and continued
on the starboard tack until the light
ship was passed. The Columbia ' as at
that time 300 yards to the leeward of
the Defender and half her length
ahead. At 12 o'clock both boats tacked
around the lightship. They continued
along In this stretch for about five
minutes, the Columbia lufling up to
take a haul on the jib halyards. At
12 20 the Defender broke out her stuy
sall and the race was on, with the De
fender to the windward. At 12:30 both
ships tacked to port, heading toward
Point Judith and footing very fast. At
first the Defender gained a tritle, but
as they continued on this hitch the
Columbia crawled up slowly and but
f' r a shift of the wind more to the
south would have crossed the De
fender's bow on the next tack*.
ThTe shift in the wind helped the De
fender considerably and when at 1
o'clock th" Columbia tacked to star
board, about a mile off the Point Judith
whistling buoy, she could have almost
forced the Defender about, but the lat
ter tacked within a hundred feet of the
former under her lee bow. Captain
Barr could not stand having his wind
taken by the Defender long, so he
fetched about at 1:05 and stood up
along shore on the port tack. Then the
Columbia began to gain slowly on the
Defender and at the same time got
into the wind better. In twenty-five
minutes the new boat had worked
across the Defender's bow and was to
the windward of her. With plenty of
wind the Columbia and Defender held
down the shore on the port tack, the
former continuing to gain. Off Noyes
Point, at 2:20, the Columbia was over
half a mile ahead and steadily in
creased her lead and when she finally
came about off the end of Fishers Is
land, the distance between the two was
nearly a mile. At 3:2* the Columbia
took her final port hitch, this time
fetching well by Race Rock. The De
fender held on the starboard tack and
then turned in after the leader. The
boats proceeded up the harbor and
anchored.

FERRY FIGHT
AT SAN PEDRO
C. P. Huntington on the
Losing Side.
DEFEATED AT EVERY TURN
SUCCESS WOULD KILL OTHER
ENTERPRISES.
People. Backed by Judge Stephens,
Appear to Hold Winning Hand
in the Struggle That la
Going On.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS AXOELES, June 28.â The con
tention between the Terminal Raihvay
and the Southern Pacific Railroad that
is being fought out at San Pedro, that
In its eTSect seeks to prevent the Hunt-
Ington interests from obtaining a ferry
franchise and a foothold on Terminal
Island, this morning received a new
impetus in the hearing before the
Board of Supervisors. The seaport
town of San Pedro entered the arena
ami jumped with bewildering sudden
ii.ss into the very thick of the Im
broglio and made an unexpected slash
at the Huntington corporation that
proved disastrous to the octopus.
Judge A. M. Stephens, on behalf of
the people of San Pedro, led the cru
sa>!e. In his statements before the.
Supervisors the Judge referred to the
ii gal Features of the case and cited the
law to show that in the event of the
ferry franchise being granted another
terry could not be operated within a
mile above or below, which he asserted
in considering the topographical feat
ures of San Pedro harbor amounted to
handing over to the Southern Pacific
Company an absolute monopoly. He
said further that San Pedro wished to
i | crate a ferry across the bay and is
about to begin proceedings to condemn
a landing place on Southern Pacific
property. The granting of the proposed
franchise would, lie nUd, Interfere with
this project.
"This ag.-," Judge Stephens said, "is
supposed to be fighting monopolies, not
fostering them. This franchise would
absolutely exclude any other ferry,
even a free one. Another could not be
granted unless the grantee owned the
landing places."
Opposing counsel regarded the grant
ing of this franchise a,s one of a public
character.
"I do not," replied Stephens. "I
should not consider It public unless it
were open to all the public all the time.
I think that a ferry operated for the
benefit of the passengers of one par
ticular railroad could not be considered
as public."
The efforts of the San Pedro people
availed and thf hearing was set over
until Friday. So far in these many
contests for this franchise the Hunting- j
ton effort has at every stage been de
feated.

Ppeclal Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, June 2S.â The fight be
-1 tween the Croker and Sheehan forces has
| become so bitter, it was learned yester
| day, that the legal machinery of the
| county may be invoked to see that both
' sides have fair play.
It is openly asserted by Mr. Sheehan's
friends that they are being threatened
i with removal from office unless they join
! in an effort to depose him as Tammany
â  leader in the Ninth Assembly District.
The same methods, it is added, are being
resorted to by Croker men in other dls
i trict*. where the fight is on.
Vnder the corrupt practices act, as it
1 now stands, it is a crime to attempt to
! dictate the action of a voter In a primary
election by using influence either for or
against t hat voter with those who control
the city departments. Mr. Shechan's
i friends declare that this is being done so
I openly, however, that they feel compelled
I to invoke the prosecuting power of the
j county to interfere.
If colonel Gardiner as District Attor
ney refuses or fails to prosecute the com
; plaints that will be made against Tam
i many officeholders and leader- it is :is
! Betted positively that Governor Roose
velt will be asked, to remove the District
Attorney for neglect of duty.
Friends of Mr. Sheehan are actively en
gaged in the work of obtaining docu
mentary evidence against Tammany lead
; ers and' office-holders. It is their purpose,
I learned yesterday, to prepare for the
Grand Jury's consideration affidavits of
many persons who declare they were or
dered to join in the fight against Mr.
Sheehan's friends under penalty of being
dismissed from public service if they fail
ed U> do so.

WILL FULLY TEST
SARANELI'S SERUM
Louisiana Health Board
to Use It.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, June 28.â Through the !
agency of the Herald experiments of
world-wide interest will be made in this
country with Dr. Giuseppe Saraneli's
serum for prevention and cure of yel
low fever â experiments the usefulness
of -which are doubly great from the
standpoint of the United States now i
that it is necesary to keep American
troops in islands where yellow fever
may be a greater menace than a hos- i
Mle army.
The Herald received some days ago j
a cable dispatch from Count Malherbe, ;
Russian Consul at Montevideo, who !
has acquired Saraneli's serum, and
offered to the Herald 300 or more bot- I
ties of it to be used in experiments in :
Louisiana with a view to having its
properties subjected to a test under
proper auspices, and in hope that the
great claims made for the serum might
be justified and great benefit conferred
upon the world at large.
Realizing the importance of the mat- ;
ter the Herald at once accepted Count
Malherbe's offer and communicated in j
turn with the Louisiana State Board
of Health.
Dr. Edmond Souchon. president of j
that board, it is said, will accept the
serum and use it when an opportunity i
affords. He does not believe, however, !
that yellow fever is a great menace i
this summer, and that if the fever
does break out there may be a diffi- I
culty in properly testing the serum's I
efficiency, since he regards it as a pre- |
ventive only. Nothing would be
proved in case the patient to whom it \
was administered escaped the scourge. !
In view of the importance of losing no
chance to enter upon experiments I
which might prove of priceless value, I
he says the board for which he speaks :
will undertake the work.
When Surgeon General Wyman of i
Washington was interviewed by a i
Herald reporter regarding the use of
the Saraneli discovery as a protection \
against and cure for yellow fever he !
expressed great interest. As to the effi- !
cacy of the serum he does not feel at
liberty to speak in advance of the Yel
low Fever Commission appointed by
the President, consisting of two bac- i
teriologists of the Marine Hospital ser- I
vice, who have just completed their i
work and are now preparing their re- j
ports.

CHINESE TAKEN
AS HOSTAGES
German Officers Fear a
Breach of Faith.
Special Dtspetch to The Call.
VICTORIA. B. C. June 28.â News was
brought by th. steamers Glenogle and
T rtar, which arrived from the orient
this morning., of a high-handed ruse per
petrated by the officers of the itlis at
Jlhchao to obtain hostages, so as to in
sure the settlement of the Stenz outrage
In that city.
The Chinese Government having guar
anteed th<> Germans in Bhang Tung from
further attacks, the Governor of Tsing
tao decided to recall his troops at Jih
ohao, whither they had been specially
Bent to obtain satisfaction for the attack
on St. nz and the punishment of the cul
prits concerned. Thi? not having been
done, ;:. was determined to take hostages
prior to the departure of the troops,
with this in view, Captain yon Falken
hayn, commanding the German detach
. asked the local mandarin to ar
g for him with the princi
pal literary- ami business men of the city.
This was accordingly done and the time
fixed for the meeting was the 25th of May,
at ll o'clock, un the morning of that day
rerman gunboat Itlis came over from
Tsingtao and anchored off the harbor of
Jlhchao and immediately all the baj
and Impediments of the troops were em
barked on tho gunboat, the men them
selves remaining on shore to await fur
ther developments.
When Captain yon Falkenhayn met the
Chinese, he asked them what they ln
tended to do about the Stem rase. As
itlsfactory answer could be obtained,
Captain yon Falkenhayn informed them
that he would tak-- five of their number
with him to Tsingtao as hostages. The
consternation which this declaration
l was very great ai 1 they with one
rd rose up against â¢ man
darin, accusing him of being privy t" this
breach of faith; but apparently n
was more astonished at this result of the
conference than the mandarin himself.
H< .â  once begged of Captain yon Falk

flphter who died on Saturday In St. Luke's

It is a wonderful soap
that takes hold quick and
does no harm.
No harm ! It leaves the
skin soft like a baby's; no
alkali in it, nothing but
soap. The harm is done by
alkali. Still more harm is
done by not washing. So,
bad soap is better than
none.
What is bad soap? Im-
perfectly made; the iat
and alkali not well bal-
anced or not combined.
What is good soap ?

Yale and Harvard headquarti rs to-night
â¢ the possible outcome of the three
races which the rolhiii crewa will row
to-morrow. Both agree thai Yale, 'mt
ring a< â  id. tits, lias a better chance In the
varsity race that will he rowed for
f"ur miles down the Thames just before
sundown.
It is also admitted by b"th that the Yale
freshmen crew will not have thÂ»' same rui
vantage over Harvard In the race of two

The facilities for vlew(*ig the races are

The police arrangements this year are
also Improved, through the kind offices of
the Treasury Department, and there will
be but little crowding of boats at the
finish near the bridge, a disagreeabli :'â¢ -

To-nignt the odds on Yaleâ thai 'were 5

RIVAL BASEBALL
LEAGUE PROMISED
There Will Be Competition Next Year
at St. Louis, Chicago, New
York and Philadelphia.
.ST. INCUTS. June 2s.â The Post-Dispatch
to-day printed this: A well known hasp-
I ball man of St. Louis said this morning: i
I "A story comes from Chicago to the ef- j
] feet that a new association on th* lines I
of the American Association is to be
formed, the National League folks being; '
.in with the play. As a matter of fact,
the Chicago story is the first bluff pent
out by the National League to head off a
movement that has been on foot for some
â  time, and which means that the National
i League is to have a competitor in all its
leading cities. The National Iveague to
' day la a house divided against itself.
Freedman hates Brush, and Brush hates
Freedman, and Boden and Rogers have a I
; thorough contempt for Hart and the Rob- ]
insons, and the feeling is reciprocated by
; the latter trio.
"There is planning and scheming on all I
Fides, and out of i? next year will come a I
rival association to the present National
; league. This, in fact, will be the last j
year that any set of men will have a j
mortgage on the national game, and there j

FITZSIMMONS WILLING
TO FIGHT KID M'COY
But the Middle-Weight Champion Is
Not Beady to Divide the
Purse.
NEW York. June 28.â "1f McCoy is at
all reasonable in his demands, Fitzpim
mona will light him for tho middle-weight
championship of the world." Bald Martin
Julian, manager of thy; middle-weight
champion, when asked to-day if Fits
would consent to meet McCoy in thfÂ» rinp.
It was evident from Juiian'-s remark that
Fitz had mad* up his mind to fight again
and that McCoy would be given th-
chance h<Â» has so long waited for. But
Fitzsimmons will not consent to give Mc-
Coy 50 per cent, win or lom -. as the "Kid"
received in th p battle with a certain
heavy-weight pugilist. ThÂ«- middle-weight
champion will allow for a liberal lohi r's
end to the purse, but it will bo a long way
from being half the amount of the purse, j
Julian said he had bt-en informed that
Ben Benton. McCoy's manager, who is
now on his way from Denver to see him.
would insist upon 50 per cent of the purs
going to the "Kid." whether he won or
lost. "If such is Benton's ultimatum." j
said Julian, "he had bettor save his car- !
fare and remain in Denver."

LOS ANGELES PEOPLE
TO WELCOME JEFFRIES
Preparing- a Big Celebration for the
Home-Coming of the Cham
pion Pugilist.
LOS ANGELES. June 2S.â The Jeffries
family is in Rood humor to-day. as word !
has been received from the champion
pugilist that on or about July 13 he will
step Into Los Angeles to enjoy a -quiet
rest for a week under the parental roof
on the Arroyo Seco. This information
also is to the effect that Jeffries will
leave Kansas City to-night and that he
may airive in San Francisco July 6. after
giving boxing exhibitions en rout-? in
Denver and Salt Lake City. . The sport- I
ing fraternity here, under the leadership
of John Brink, is preparing a reception
for the champion at the athletic club.
It has not been decided on what date I
he will give a sparring exhibition, but ad- i
mirers of the champion to-night Insist
that the largest hall in the city must
be secured to accommodate the crowd.
The character of the reception at the club
will be informal, permitting every one
to clasp the hand that gave the antipo
dean his quietus.
While the mother of Jeffries is modestly
proud of her bis: hoy, she recognises that !
in taking on-Steark-eyj during October and
In Jim's sailing for Europe late in July
the lad has entered the prize ring
to stay, and that he will make fighting |
his business. The greatest regret that ;

see Jim until a late date in his new role

is being written for the champion.
Star Fistic Combination.
WHEELING, VV. Va., June 2S.â Oscar j
Gardner has received n letter from Hilly
Delaney. ''h.impion Jim Jeffries' trainer,
frnm California, asking if he would con-:
senl til join a star fistic combination
which will do a tour of the country after
September. Tommy Ryan, the welter
weight, was to be one of the party and
was to divide the honors with Gardner in
meeting all comers in their classes alone:
the road. Jeffries and Ed Dunkhorst, his:
sparring partner, were to complete the
aggregation. Gardner wrote to Delaney i
his willingness to X" with the party.
Tommy Ryan and Kid McCoy.
SYRACUSE, N. V.. June 28.â Tommy
Ryan to-day expressed his willingness
to right Kid McCoy, but said he -would
not accept the offer from Denver If some
ntnor club should offer a. larger purse
than the Colorado Athletic Club. Ryan
said he would post a forfeit with Lou
Houseman of Chicago which McCoy could
cover if he wished. Of McCoy's willing
ne:-s to fight Ryan professed to be skep

Here This Weekâ Why John
son Is Out of the
Game.
Santa Cruz ha? taken another firm hol.i
on first place, with San Francisco well
up. Watsonville and San Jose are on al
most, even termÂ«, while Sacramento has
crawled out of the hole, leaving Oakland
to carry the target. The club percentages
are as follows:

Dissension among the members, with a.
propensity to ply their steam hammers
upcn each other's heads, together with
an all too lenient management, has
landed the Oakland team at the bottom

Crack Shortstop.
of the list. The claim is raised that the
element of "bard luck" hns had much to
do with this deplorable Btate of affairs.
That is rankest nonsense. At the b.-g,ii
ning of the season there was not a more ;
promising team in the league than Ew
ing's hunch, but he has ruined it by too )
much leniency. A few words of praise
for good work has swilled some of the I
men so that they have got it into their
heads that all they have to do is to wa'k
out on the diamond and pose. They want
to get away from that impression with i
OUt delay. Then an element of discord ,
has been Injected, which, if not promptly
suppressed, will disrupt the team com
pletely and work irreparable injury to the
game. Manager Ewing is aware of thu
soiine of this discord and he should weed
it out without a moment's delay. It does
not comprise the best players, and even
if it did it would be better to get rid or j
them than to let them continue to have
full swing. Ewing is away just now and
the process of partially reorganizing tho I
team has been left to Ed Johnson anrl
Fred Lange. For a starter, they have ro- :
leased Russell and McGuire, two moves
that could not be worse. Russell was Im
mediately snapped up by Tuttle, who will
find him a worthy successor to Donlin.
Russell is lazy (the ball player never
lived who was not), and as long a:' h"
could escape practice he did so. Tnste.ul
of adopting disciplinary measures. Ewing
fooled along, with him until it was im
possible to get anything out of him, and
then let him go. Tuttle will have Rus
sell up with the best of them within two
weeks.
After Sunday's game McGuire was re
leased and Ford, who caught for the Ath
letics last year, has been signed In his
place. Ford is a good little player, but ;
there were enough midgets in the team
without him. What ought to have been
done was to place Hardie at first and send
McGuire into the field, for a time at least.
McGuire is a terrific batter ordinarily, and '
It was not to be expected that he could
get into the game after two years' ah- ,
sence and hit it out at the start. Hardie
could play the initial position second to!
none, but naturally he is not considered
when it is remembered that it is toward
him the hammers are aimed. If Ford
doesn'l fill the bill. Dunlcavy will be ;
brought into first. Efforts are being made
to find another pitcher, which looks as
though Shea would continue to be over
look- d . an Russell was as well. Mean
while Moskimmi continues on his own
Bweel way. not a word of reprimand hav
ing been administered to him for his de
liberate shirking a week ago. He de
served to be fined a month's salary.
Mike Donlin started East on Tuesday
night to join the St. Louis team. His
California admirers are anxiously await

opponents. Andrews' work was simply

Oakland will go to Santa Cruz this week, |
and a large party of excursionists will
accompany the team. The railroad has ]
made special rates, tickets being good

the excursion.
The new Watsonville management is '
' casting about for new material. The ,
j te;im as now constituted is playing a ]
. great fielding game, but is weak at the
bat. and it is the intention to get two :
or three good stickers for the team.

The San Francisco Athletic Club's
Regular Monthly Exhibition
Gives Promise of Usual
Exciting Sport.
The absence of the bookmakers and
other followers of the turf is noticeable
in the decreased attendance at the big
boxing meetings these summer months, i
This does not apply to the exhibition of
the San Francisco Athletic Club, as i
nvmth in and month out the number of
spectators is limited only by the capacity j
of th gymnasium on Sixth street.
The programme for to-night is miule up
! of five eight-round bouts, each pair of
1 boxers being especially selected in order ;
|to prepare against nny misfits. Alex ;
I Greggains is the official referee. He has
incorporated in the Queensberry rules !
Hume ideas of his own which seem to
lpring out all the combativeness of the
boxers.
The men matched for to-night are: Kid j
Johnson and Jack McMahon, 12T> pounds; I
Ben Lewis and W. Ingham. 145 pounds; '
Jack Dean and Ed Toy. 133 pounds; Tom \
; Monihan and Joe Kane, 150 pounds, and ]
George Dodson and James Crawford. As
â  it is the exception to have an uninter
, esting bout, this fine bunch of boxers
: should show excellent sport. Being In the :
embryo state, they have no reputations
as fighters to lose, and will mix matters

SAN FRANCISCO POLITICS.
HE new charter gives extraordinary power* to
"""I 'the Mayor of San Francisco. He will abso-
T" control f the School, Fire He Police de-
Intely control the S Fire 2nd Police de
: p.irtments. He can dictate from the selection oi
j school books, their use or exclusion, down to the pur
\ chase of fire hose and the assignment of beats to
â¢ roundsmen. . This city is naturally Republican. On
i a straight patty division we undoubtedly have a ma
â  iority. When a Republican candidate is of undoubted
I character and popularity he is usually reinforced by a
i large independent vote. When the whole Republi
! can ticket offers a decided preference to those who
i seek the best men to administer public affairs, it gets
! independent aid and succeeds.
The ' tor; of San Francisco proves that a man's
! politics and party connections do not afreet his char
â  acter and standing. A man is not honest because he
is a Republican, or Democrat, or Populist. The
bosses have habitually nominated bad tickets and have
aÂ«ked votes for them by proudly biting the party
I label. Mayor Phelan has personally selected a School
i Board and Supervisors, rounded them up and
i branded them with his crest and coat â â  ; arms, in al
dition to their party tap, and they proved the worst
....... has had out of a long line of bad ones.
The Republican party can win San Francisco, but it
must do it by nominating men who re something
more than Republicans. When their party skin is
scratched, ...... be found ber.eath it.
[ : The Call has stood by the Republican party in good
j report and ill, nd will be found abiding by Re; . -
! lican principles and to the front when and where they
; arc to be battled for. But The Call will not support
j a ticket in this city because it is called a Republican
' ticket. The men upon it must in their high character
| â¢ resent the great principles which they profess. II
i they do the party will win. If they do not. The Call
| will render the best sen-ice which can be given the
party, by defeating them. The Republican party is
stronger to-d because The Call ha; smitten, and
spared not, the tncKsters, ringstei and rascals who
seek to use the party as a train robber uses dynamite.
We propose thai its gain in character and in popu
lar confidence, by reason of its resistance to the cor
rupt forces which are always thin every, party seek
ing its control, shall not be lost by any retreat from
the position we have taken. If an honest Republican
ticket cannot be elected in this city none shall be.
We have no favorites to urge, no candidates to ad
vance for nomination. We only ask of those who will
â  direct affairs that they make a ticket that is above
\ suspicion. If they do this the party will come to its
i own in San Francisco. If they do not, the hungry
and dry Democracy will do some high looting, fcr
which the Republican party will be primarily respon
sib'e by us fa re to nominate good men. As lor us,
iif rascals must be elected they must be from the

HAWAIIAN '-GOOD GOVERNMENT."
AFK :ans in Hawaii are asking them
â  . _ ment" mÂ« v
â  â¢ ' {sessions. Two white laborers, bound
tract with a penal clause to labor on the
Honomu plantation, found tl subjected to
treatment as made negr - â  in this country
â¢ g and ran away. â  -as our s
used to depart by the underground railroad. They
were pursued, hunted down, and by a district magis
- â  â¢ â  until they would return to bondage.
They demanded a trial by jury, their right under the
constitution of the United States, and were refused,
and, when they appealed to the Hawaiian Supreme
; .una! anirrr.ed the court below and de
prived them of constitutional shelter by holding their
tary servitude legal, and they must either rot
in jail or go back to bondage. Remember that these
bondmen are white men. lured to the Paradise of the
Pacific to find it a hell.
The constitution of the United States say?:
"Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall exis:
within the United States or any place subject to their
jurisdiction."
By joint resolution of Congress Hawaii was an
nexed to the United States and made subject to their
jurisdiction nearly a year ago. The laws of the
United States forbid contract labor and the constitu
tion forbids involuntary servitude.
Since Hawaii became subject to our jurisdiction
about 30,000 Asiatic coolies have been imported to the
islands under contract, and some white laborers lured
there have been constrained to accept contract bond
age with the coolies. When Senator Morgan was
! iked by the native Hawaiians what they would get
for merging their sovereignty in the United States
and coming under our jurisdiction, he replied that
they would get '"good government.''
It appears, then, that good government in our dis
tant possessions consists in denying the right of trial
by jury and the enforcement of involuntary servitude!
Is it possible that the American spirit which was
roused by the return of negroes to bondage has so
completely died out that we ail consent to the return
of fugitive white men to slavery? When the militia
</. Massachusetts -,vcs called out to execute the writ
of the courts of that commonwealth and return the
negro, Anthony Burns, to slavery. Wendell Phillips,
addressing a great audience in Faneuil Hail, said:
"At the head of every judicial writ issued by a court
, in this State runs the legend, 'God bless the commou
vvealtfa of Massachusetts.' But if these writs are to be
1 used to return human beings to slavery, let the legend
be changed to read, 'God damn the commonwealth of
. Massachusetts." "
That climax roused the nation like a tocsin, and
; the current of feeling arose until, under the leadership
j of Lincoln, slavery was swept away and the constitu
: tien of the republic was made to canonize against in
voluntary servitude in any place under its jurisdiction.
The Call persistently warned the people of this
country of the results of Hawaiian annexation. When
â  President Dole said that after annexation "a way
would be found to get satisfactory labor for the plan
tations," we foresaw just what is happening now and
warned our readers of it. Unhappily, the most im
portant guarantees of the constitution, trial by jury
and prohibition of involuntary servitude, are abro
gated in the good government we have established
; there. An election being ordered for members of the
I local Legislature, the men who conspired for annexa
tion, being in fear of the reaction which appeared
among those who love liberty, induced President Mc-
Kinley to forbid such election. So we have another
I American constitutional right denied to Hawaii.
; Could any Asiatic despot do more? When one re
j fleets that there is no war in Hawaii, no resistance to
: authority, but, on the other hand, a patient subjection
i to annexation, there is absence of any legal reason
j for denial of jury trial and refusal of the habeas cor
! pus and destruction of personal rights. In the ab

A DAY AFTER THE FAIR
THE iixaminer, as is usual with that redoubtab'.:
:ate of "an internal policy/ 1 in the matt
- : the military excesses in the neighborhood of
tdner Idaho, is a "day after the fair."' In its
I :iay and Tuesday it devotes its fr
fa^re to the subject, which, in every conceivable a;- â¢
the amplest details, of fact, has been
- ; explained and is fully comprehended by
: the United States.
The attack upon property at Wardner by a number ]
of disaffected miners, supposed to be connected with j
the Miners* Union, occurred on April 29, 1899. . On j
May 3 The Call expressed the opinion that the law \
should be vindicated and the. guilty rioters punished j
on the ground that, in the United States, there is but;
one law for rich and poor alike. On May 14, under â 
the head of Military Imperialism," The Call, adher- ]
ing to its uniform position in favor of equality before .
the law. expressed the popular indignation bee. i
'under the pretext of suppressing riotous demonstra
tions, the Federal and the State constitutions." within
the r district around Wardner. in the county of Sho- j
shone, Idaho, had been "substantially trodden under
foot nd a practical illustration of imperialism fur
nished within the limits of an autonomous State.'' It
further brought to the notice of the authorities the
provisions of the Federal constitution relating to the 1
writ of habeas corpus, and, while relieving the Wash- |
ington ..... from ar.v possible complicity in
the intolerable despotism that had been temporarily
estabiished in Idaho, demanded its interference, to j
the greatest practicable extent, in order that the u?ual I
conditions mieht be re-established and the - rem
acy of the ordinary law of the State restored.
In these references The Call has no desire to vaunt
itself.' It simply performed its duty to the public, not
only in the expression of opinion but in supplying
the' news, not a single item of which of any mate
riality, in spite of the censorship of press dispatches,
has failed to reach it; columns.
There is also reason to believe that the administra
tion u a? performed its constitutional obligations, thai
I the military situation has been gradually ameliorated
and. that even the State authorities have been made
to comprehend that there are limits they must not
pas;.
After all this work has been done and these re
sults achieved through an independent and enterpris
ing press, voicing the true sentiments of American
! citizenship, the fossilized Examiner has discovered
! that there are a few questions to be settled in the
neighborhood of Wardner .-. I has twice devoted its
first page to a rehash of facts which every one has
I known for weeks. Indeed it is now probable that the
, redress of the grievances of various sorts that have
been so glaring in Idaho for nearly two months has
become part of the "internal policy of the organ of
Bourbonized fusion that has recently discovered the
illegitimacy of the political abortion it produced last
year. The ordinary reporters of the press having
completely gleaned the Idaho field and now simply
. fun -shine the fresh news of each day. a "commis
sioner" haÂ« been dispatched who has succeeded, after
much labor, in verifying the historical records con
tained in the columns of The Call, and, it may be
added, a large part of them original and exclusive.
Examiner, i
had any. is about gone. Its relation to the world of
rapidly accumulating news seems to be also in pr
of dissolution.
OUR HOME-COMING VOLUNTEERS.
SENATOR PERKINS' dispatch to the Presi
dent requesting information as to the
when the First California Regiment would em- :
j bark to return home has not brought forth any deft
nite information on the subject. Adjutant General ;
Corbin, replying for the President at the instance of ,
j the Secretary of War. does no more than direct the j
â  attention of the Senator to that portion of a recently
published cable from General Otis in which it is
' stated: "Nebraska. Pennsylvania and Utah now I
'taking transports, and Sixth Infantry sent to Negros
to relieve California."
From this information it appears the work of re
' lieving the volunteers is going forward about as rap
idly as can be effected under the circumstances. The
California regiment, however, instead of being first.
or among the first, to be relieved, is to be one of the .
hlast The Oregon volunteers are already on their way ;
; home, those of Nebraska. Pennsylvania and Utah
were embarking at the time Otis sent his cable, but '
the Californians were still at Negros waiting for the
Sixth Infantry to relieve them.
While the delay in the home-coming of our vol
tecrs is not according to our hopes, it is still one :
; which the people of the State will bear with the loy- ,
: alty of patriotism. It was a high compliment to the
Californians that they were intrusted with a separate
duty in distant islands far removed from the main
, command. They won that honor by distinguished
service and discipline, and the State, has reason to be i
â  proud of it. That separate command, however, de
| lays them at the front while others come home. High
. duties impose high responsibilities, and honors, like '
; everything else, must be balanced in the scale of com- j
: pensations.
It is now assured, however, that in a time compara
tively short our toys will be sailing home. Then will ;
! come an occasion for San Francisco to make a gala |
i day and invite all Californians to come to town and |
help in the grand reception of the home-coming he- j
j roes. That day is now not distant. Once relieved at
! Negros the volunteers may embark immediately for j
j home, and it is. therefore, none too early to begin j
â  preparations for making their welcome a festival of !
more than ordinary brilliance and enthusiasm.
Professor Gayley says apologetically that the Uni- i
verity of California is suffering from growing pains. \
'. Is it possible that the learned gentleman would wish
' to see the institution in the agonies of the rheumatism ;
i of old age?
So far friends of the British royal family have been â¢
able to keep from the poet laureate the knowledge \
that her Majesty ha? entered on the sixty-third year \
,of her reign. They fear it might provoke him to in- |
flict the public with one of his poems.
The other day a Columbus centenarian was di
vorced and was then almost kidnaped. He probably
thinks that he escaped two phases of the same fate on 'â 
the same day.
It is stated as a fact not to be doubted that there are
fortunes in oil in California. None of the painters
hereabouts seem to have found them.
SUGGEST OF OF NAP AS MAYOR
FOR THE DEWEY MONUMENT
MAYOR I. A. FULLER OF NAPA.
IF anybody thinks that Napa win lag behind her sister cities of
Si â  'n aiding the I - â¢:â  â¢ eminent let him, or her, read
the . oylng lettei ft Mayor I- A. Fuller:
NAPA. June 28.
To the Editor of The Call â Sir: In erecting a monument to
Admiral Dewey and the American navy, the people of Califor
nia have adopted the most worthy means of perpetuating his
memory. When a man reaches the pinnacle of fame it is natural
that his countrymen should seek some such means of honoring
him. It is my hope that this tribute to the great sea captain
â¢will surpass that erected by the English people to Lord Nelson,
both in proportions of architecture and elaborate design, as the
battle of Manila Bay surpasses the battle of Trafalgar.
Other States may follow the footsteps of California, hut I
want to see our own State outstrip all the others, and I would
suggest that every county in the State not only subscribe to
the fund, but also contribute a block of its most durable mate
rial to be used in the construction of this tribute of our appre
ciation of the matchless courage of this man. whose incentive
was fealty to his flag, whose hope of reward was the approval
of his conscience and of his countrymen.
I. A. FULLER. Mayor.
LAST OF THE
FOURTH SAILS
FOB MANILA
Presidio Changing Its
Garrison.
Another installment of troops went j
from the Presidio yesterday on their way
to the Philippines. The headquarters,
band and Troops B and M .of the Fourth j
Cavalry and Companies E and H of the â 
Twenty-fourth Infantry made up the de- :
tachment. The whole was under com- j
mand of Major Morton of the Fourth :
Cavalry. Companies E and H are new
arrivals at the post, but the two cavalry
troops had been there for a lons time. :
As a consequence when they started lor
the McDowell, in which they were taken j
to the Valencia, there were scenes very
similar to those which made the going
away of the First Infantry such Â«i
memorable event.
All departments at the Presidio are
bending their energies toward preparing
for the reception of troops, both coming
from and going to the Philippines. The
last of the Fourth Cavalry has gone. and
it will not be long before the Twenty
fourth Infantry will A>e away, but
there is no diminution in the num
ber of men quartered at the post. j
They are arriving by hundreds, and
the "parade ground is filled with drill
ing recruits every morning and after
noon. Tents are new being erected to re- i
ceive the Oregon Volunteers when ifcey
come, but if space is needed before tnat
time the tents will be used for recruits. It
is expected that the permanent canps
will be able to accommodate ten or twelve ;
thousand men when they have all been
finished.
Colonel Freeman, commanding the
Twenty-fourth Infantry, was expected to
sail for Manila on the Pennsylvania; then
he was changed to the Valencia, and
now it looks as if he would have
two or three weeks more here. It is
probable that he will remain as long
as there is any of his regiment left and
that he will go out with the last of it.
In the meantime who his successor as
commander of the post will be is a mat
ter of conjecture.
It seems to be the intention of the Gov
ernment to make of the Presidio a cav
alry or an artillery post, as it was before
the" war. Two troops of the Sixth. Cay- '
airy came in last Monday and more are
expected, while the Third Artillery, the
old garrison regiment, seems to be drift- .
ing back again. Light Battery C is al- !
ready there, and there/ is a detachment
of Battery B at Yosemite and another at
Alcatraz. The detachment at Yosemit?
will be relieved by Troop F of the Sixth
Cavalry within a short time.
Lieutenant Thomas F. Slavens has been
ordered to duty as quartermaster and
commissary on the freighter Weyfield,
which will take down the horses for the
cavalry men Â» going on the Valencia. A
non-commissioned officer and ten troopers
from each troop have been ! detailed to
care for the horses.
Company X of the Twenty-fourth In
fantry is reported from Assinaboine as;
having started for the Presidio. It will :
probably arrive to-day.

WARDEN AGUIRRE
BUMPS INTO THE
PRISON BOARD
A Clash Over Certain
Appointments.
From the common talk indulged in by
politicians,- it would seem, that Martin G.
Aguirre, the new Warden of San Qui
Prison, Intends trying things all
his own way as regards the matter of
appointments and conduct of the prison
generally. If what is said by several who
are in a position to know whereof they
sirak is to be relied upon. Aguirre has
already clashed with the Board of State
Prison Directors and will r.c: :' :
take his seat as Warden until July L'
The inception of the trouble between the
board and the new Warden, it is said, is
due wjiolly to an attempt on the part of
Aguirre, acting as the agent of Dan
Burns, to place ex-Supervisor Ed Smith
in the position of commissary at the
prison. This was the original intention,
but when Aguirre made known his desire
to make Smith commissary be m< I
decided opposition. The Directors voiced
their unanimous sentiment thai for vari
ous reasons Smith was
office and should never receive UK
dorsement.
Finding that argument and other de
vices were unable to gain his end. Aguirre
finally declared that he would appoint
Smith whether the board liked it or
But when he thus laid down his hand in
perfect confidence Aguirre found that ht
had been euchred. He was not politician
enough to cope with the veteran board
and was soon made to realize ::. Wli
a moment's hesitation he was informed
that as Warden he had a right to appoint
whomever he might wish, but that the
board controlled the salary of the posi
tion, and if Smith was appointed would
reduce it to $25 a month. Staggered at
this reply, Aguirre came to this city and
held a consultation with his political" mas
ters, the result of which was that it was
finally admitted the board held the whip
hand and must bo respected. So Smith
was not appointed.
But Aguirre felt so angry and chagrin
ed over his defeat that he immediately
laid plans to be revenged. He did not
have to nurse his wrath long, for a short
time afterward the board requested
Aguirre to retain Captain J. F. Biriem as
captain of the guard, and Indorsed him
as perhaps the most efficient officer at
San Quentin. Aguirre sweetly acquh -
but winked the other eye, at the same
time leading the board to believe that
Thomas Wilkinson should remain as com
missary. In fact, it is stated that the Di
rectora felt so positive of the retention of
these two men that President Fitzgerald
sent Wilkinson a telegram no later than
last Tuesday telling him to be at his ease
â everything had been fixed nicely.
On the same day Aguirre introduced ex-
Chief of Police Russell of San Diego to
Biriem as his successor and notified Wil
kinson that on the first of the month
Thomas Foley. the father of Gage's pri
vate secretary, would be made commis
sary. To complete his pleasant work the
wiseacres say. Deputy Sheriff McCiure of
Los Angelt-s was appointed turnkey to
succeed J. C. Jamieson. and Deputy Sher
iff Barnhill of the same place front gate
keeper to succeed Fred Woods. Captain
of the Yard Edgar, generally admitted to
be the most unpopular official at San
Quentin. has been retained for the sime
reason, but it is believed that even for the
purpose of revenge Aguirre cannot afford
to keep Edgar long.
The feeling is represented to be so keen
that the board will not let a long time
elapse before it will endeavor to make the
Warden realize that it is a large factor In
prison affairs and must be respected.

IN DAUGHTER'S SIGHT
Mrs. Kopp Sends a Bullet Into the
Brain of the Man Who
Scorned Her Love.
After Making Sure That He Was With Another Woman,
She Taxed Him With Infidelity and He
Laughed in Her Face.
CHARLES KOPP, a retired res
taurant keeper, was shot and
killed last night by his wife", Mrs
Louise Kopp, in the presence of
their 14-year-old daughter. The shoot-
Ing took place in the parlor of the fam
ily residence, 18 Lewis place, off Tay
lor street, between Post and Putter.
Leaving the body where it fell, blood
oozing from the death wound over the
left eye, mother and daughter left the
house, locking the door on their dead.
They visited the house of near relatives
in the Mission, informed them of the
tragedy and returned to their own
home, where Mrs. Kopp surrendered
â herself to the police.
"I did it," she exclaimed, dry eyed,
"because I wanted him for myself."
That short sentence told the whole
story. Kopp loved another than his
wife.. Jealousy seized the neglected
;cyo man./ already tottering to the grave
with consumption. She taxed him
with 1. .- infidelity, and he boastingly
ridmatted^t.- because she wanted
him for. herself, she shot him dead.

Under the name of Virginia Drew and
unknown to her husband Mr?. Trescott.
wife of Charles B. Trescott, the milllon
' aire fish packer of Portland, Or., made
| Jier debut on Monday evening at the Al
; cazar.
Mrs. Trescott has been In the city for
the past six months, presumably for her
health, but in reality giving all her time
and attention to fitting herself for the
Stage. No one about the theater nor any
of the people the lady has met during her
stay here had any idea that the woman
j who was making so many sacrifices in
; art's name was the wife of a millionaire.
She made no use of her social position to
help hrr in her artistic career, preferring
to stand on her own merits.
On Monday evening a well-known Port
land gentleman in the audience recognized
Miss Virginia Drew as Mrs. Trescott, and
yesterday the escapade of the mlllion
. aire's wife was the sole theme of gossip
both in social and theatrical circles.
â \Vhon Mrs. Trescott was confronted

have felt the desire to go upon the stage.
It Is in my blood. My mother was a
Drew. Mr. TreÃCOtt ami I were not con- j
genial. He does nothing but sleep and
Count his money. I long for an artistic \
atmosphere. I
"When I cime to town last winter," the
lady continued. "I decided to prepare my
self for the stage. I had been studying
for years to thai end, but lacked the tech
nical training. I went through a most
rigid course. I took up psychical re
search, theosophy, Christian Science and
hypnotism with the intention of learning
to establish an electrical current between
myself and my audience and thereby
draw them toward me.
"Mr. Trescotl made me an allowance â a I
very small one when considered In pro- j
portion to his vast wealthâ but my studies
came high, and many times the taking of
a lesson has meant for me privation."
Mrs. Trescott explained that she had
not told her husband of her Intentions in
regard to a theatrical career, for she :
knew he would not approve of it and that
his disapproval would probably take the
inconvenient form of a failure to send !
remittances. "When I won fame, as I 1
feel 1 must, I intended to tell him." said ;
the would-be debutante. "He Is a sure- ;
thing man. and if he -saw I was a winner I
he would hank on me."
Mr.--. Trescott has the physique critics
are pleased to describe as that of a trag
edy queen. She pays she longs to play
Berntfardt roles ;ind that the glove and
boot that fit the divine Sarah are of the
size she herself wears.
"Emotional is my forte." said Mrs.
Trcsoott. "In that way I feel I can pive
vent to all the suffering I have endured
for years."
Mrs. Trescott is well known In Port
land, Or., and has for many years been
a recognized social leader there. She is
a Southern woman of excellent family
and was wedded to Trescott six years ago.
Her uncle. Ethan Allen, is one of the mil
lionaire merchants of Portland.

THE DIRECTORS
HOLD ANOTHER
SECRET SESSION
Discussing the Text
books.
NOT MANY CHANGES MADE
HEAD WAS NOT CONSULTED ON
JANITORS.
He Made Complaint and an Interest
ing Report Was Referred
Back for Consid
eration.
The Board of Education hid its face
agrain last evening and discussed text
hooks behind closed doors. Textbooks
were what caused a good part of the
scandal in the administration of the last
board. The executive session was not
called without a protest from Director
Head, however, but the board preferred
secrecy and sought it in adjoining
room.
When the motion to discuss the text
books in committee of the whole was
made by Stow, Head grew suspicious and
demanded to know whether the conven
tion of the committee of the whole would
be secret. President Bergerot said he
could not guess at the intentions of the
board. Head declared the subject of text
books was a most important one, and one
in which every parent had an interest,
and he believed the matter should be dis
cussed in public. The motion to go into
committee of the whole prevailed, how
ever. Head was called to the chair, and
then Bergerot himself made the motion
to go into executive session.
Head got in another protect on the re
port of the committee on janitors. Head
is a member of the committee, and when
he found a report had been submitted he
got up and declared there had been no
meeting of the committee, for he had
never been notified. The names of Cole
and Kemp were signed to the report, but
Cole, the committee chairman, was forced
to admit that he had called no meeting,
and so the report was sent back to the
committee until it could be presented in
proper form. The report was as follows:
Your Committee on Janitors respectfully
recommends the following chÃn*es: Mrs. Kate
Halnes. vice Mrs. J. M. Murphy, Bernal
School- Mrs. M. McClellan, vice Mrs. J. Hun
ter Cooper School; Mrs. Shields, vice Mrs. M.
Manning. Hancock School; Mrs. small, vice
Mr? it Hcaphy. Uincon School; Mrs. Bacon,
vice Mrs. M. Murphy, Hamilton School: F.
Jack-Ron, vice J. O'Farrell, Horace Mann
School.
The Finance Committee recommended
that all demands for June he allowed and
ordered paid, and that the 5 per cent de
ducted from January demands and sal
aries he also allowed. The recommenda
tions were adopted.
Leave of absence from July SI, 1899, to
August 18, 1899. was granted Miss Lillian
O'Nell of the Peabody School.
Miss Caroline M. Biason made appli
cation to be placed on the pension roll.
On recommendation of the Committee
on Buildings and Grounds, it was decided 1
t<> grant the use of the school lot on San |
Bruno avenue, near Twenty-fifth street,
to the City for Fire Department pur- i
poses
On recommendation of the Committee
on Salaries, the salary of Miss P. M. No
lan secretary of the City Board of Ex- ;
amination. was lixed at $37 50 a month I
from July 1, 1*99. The salary is the same
as heretofore.
The Committee on Judiciary recom- !
mended the granting of the petition of
Mrs M. E. Caldwoll to be placed on the :
retired list, with the understanding, how
ever, that the board would in no way be
responsible fÂ»>r any money she might
claim under the annuity fund act.
The following were granted grammar
grade certificates on their diplomas of
graduation from the San Francisco Nor
mal School: Miss Joanna Zelinsky. Miss
Harriet V. Rooney and Miss Florence C.
Snnkey of the class of 1897, and Miss
Mabel A. Newman of the class of 1898.
The grammar grade certificates of Miss
Elizabeth Dennis. Miss Ellen R. Downey,
Mrs. George A. Mullln, Miss Alice J. Yin- I.
cent and Mrs. Josephine Wickstrom were '
renewed.
The following were recommended to the
State Board of Examination for life di
plomas: Mrs. C. B. Coons. Miss Hettie M.
Corlett, Miss Theresa E. Derham and Miss
Emma Elliott. *
One hundred graduates of the San Fran
cisco Normal School, class of 1899, were
granted grammar grade certificates.
A protest from Brown & Power
against the awarding of the ink and pa- j
per contract to Payot, I'pham & Co. was i
referred to the Committee on Supplies.
Bids for school books for the coming
year were received from Potter, Putnam
& Co.; D. C. Heath &. Co.: Educational
Publishing Company; American Book
Company; Prang Educational Company;
Silver. Burdett & Co.: Butler, Sheldon &
Co.; Maynard, Merrill & Co., and Ginn &
Co.
These bids' were taken up under the
head of new business and were considered
in executive session. The result was these
resolutions:
\\ hereas. There is almost unanimity of opin
ion among the teachers anil principals, and
also among the parents of pupils, against
changes in text hooks now In use In the de
partment; and wherea;-, the hooks now in use
are satisfactory. Therefore be it
Keeolved, That no change in the system oi \
music books, business forms, mental arithmetic, â¢,
bookkeeping literature now in use, with the '
exception of select American classics, be made
Resolved. That the following srhoolbooks ir. :
French be recommended to the Superintendent

Lecture."
That for the purpose of use as a text-hr>ok

'Page's Heart Culture" be distributed only to
the teachers of the department.
That the Prang system of drawing now in
use in the department be readopted; that the
Snaylor system of "vertical round handwrit
ing' copy books be adopted: ' V : i
That the successful bidders on .text-books pay
the cost Qf advertising as apportioned by the
secretary before the contract is signed.
In the executive meeting it was also
decided that Rose Lewis should.be trans
ferred from the evening unassigned list
to the day unassifmed list; also that the
salary of E. C. Kirkpa trick, principal
of the Business Evening School, for each
month from February, 1896, to February,
ISD9, should be allowed, and that the bid

ber will be readvertlsed for.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. June 28.â Conditions at the open
ing In Wheat favored higher prices. Liver-
I pool showed a liberal response to yesterday's
! advance here, opening V'<-V; higher and main
tained most of its advance. Continental mar
kets were also higher. A decidedly bullish
feature was- the falling off in Northwest re
ceipts and influenced the market enough to !
keep prices >n the upgrade for about half an
hour alter the opening. Then the weakness
at St. Louts which wan thought to be due to !
expectations of larger receipts of new Wheat '
in the near future and weekly crop reports
started a moderate felling movement which
carried prices considerably below the opening
point and gave the old familiar appearance or
weakness to things in general. September
; opened at "i'^fi'^c. compared with yester
day's closing price of 74^c. It advanced to
74\'</74\i . then gradually slid off until Tl I*'1 *'
had been reached. At this point the market
took another turn and until within about half
an hour 'of the close, though extremely quiet.
1 was strong. . St. Louis' weakness was said to
be due entirely to local elevator difficulties'
and not to fear of heavy new Wheat receipts.
Crop advices from all sections of the spring
Wheat country told of damage from rust and
from wet weather followed by the heat of last
Sunday. The Illinois State report estimated ;
that 1 per cent of the crop was lost and the ;
condition of the rest only 38 per cent. Sep- !
temper advanced to 74V"""<\ when a realizing
movement set in which carried September to
. 74V. where It closed.
: Corn was dull and heavy. The market started
with Wheat, but liberal receipts, favorable
crop conditions and heavy estimated receipts
to-morrow started liquidation. September
closed %'s>-ic lower.
Cats were dull but firm. September closed
with a gain of %c. Crop damage reports and
foreign advices were the bullish features.
Provisions were strong. Hog prices were '<
higher and this with the strength of Wheat
and the good shipping demand kept prices firm
and a little higher. At the close September
Pork was 5Â©7Â«4c higher. Lard 5c higher and

HAT AND FEEDSTUFFS.
There is a fair demand for â¢ Hay at prac
tically unchanged â  quotations. Receipts are .
light, but are expected to be heavy after the
Fourth-. * '-: '
The circular of Somers & Co. says: "We
have a very uninteresting market to report at
the present time, and we may reasonably ex
pect .but little to he done with hay for the
next week or ten days. Very little if any of
the new crop hay now being marketed has
been through the stack and much Is, there
fore, improperly cured. We are con
stantly hearing complaints from apparently
dry looking hay which proves to be oftentimes
sour and sometimes hot. Shippers of hay are
probably satisfied that theirs Is well cured he
fore marketing; same, but after being con
fined In a close car for a few days It com
mences to sweat in the bale. Consumers will
not buy this kind of hay to lay away; there
fore same has to be sold for Immediate con
sumption. Until we can be reasonably as
sured that everything marketed Is in good
shape and is fit to be stored away for winter's
use. we will have no well-established market
here. Much of the crop In the country Is now
In the stack, and the farmers are all busy har
vesting. When they are through . with â¢ their
grain they will prepare to market their hay.
and we may then expect free shipments of
well-cured hay on the San Francisco market.
"Receipts are not very heavy for this time
of year, and yet they are ample for all de
mands. Alfalfa is scarce and in good demand.
There is scarcely enough being marketed for
a well-established price."

The accident happened about dusk, last

Call correspondent. The eminent educa
tor was gratified when he was told of
his election, but he said nothing to indi
cate whether he would accept or decline.
i A definite answer by wire from Dr.
' Wheeler is dally exported. Last evening
a_ message came that he had pone to New
York to meet Mrs. Hearst on her return
, from Europe. It is supposed that he Is
1 withholding his reply until he has had an
. interview with Mrs. Hearst, whose gen
' erous support of the university has given
, the institution special prominence. Mrs.
Hearst, although a regent, did not desire
, to participate In the election of president
of the university. On the contrary, she
expressed a wish that the question might
settled during her absence. To ,x
--; Governor Budd and several of the regents
t she has spoken of plans for the extension
- of the university and of her readiness to
: contribute means from her own fortune to
advance the development. It may be as
isumed. therefore, that Dr. Wheeler de-
Sires to l>t- fully informed regarding the
measure of support which she has in view.
Her attitude toward the university will
probably Influence his course. â¢
The constitution of the State of Cali
fornia declares that the university shall
constitute a public trust, and that it shall
be entirelj Independent of all political or
sectarian Influence, and kept free there
: from In the appointments of its regents
1 and in the administration of its affairs.
The law of the State provides that an
annual tax of two cents on each $100 shall
be levied for the support of the uni
ty. The declaration of the constitu
tion should dispel all doubt as to the
permanency of the institution, and the
provision In the statute should give as
surance of its future financial support,
i These pledges of maintenance would al
lure an ordinary president, but I>r.
Wheeler la said to possess m.ire than or
j dinar>' accomplishments, and therefore
has a right to expect more than ordinary
Inducements.
Regi â  â¢ Rodgera may be able at the
meeting next Saturday to produce positive
assurance "f l>r. Wheeler's acceptance.
The salary was fixed at Jin.ivyi per annum,
so that the new preside nt may have Buffl
â  : ey to entertain his friends. In
East Dr. Wheeler is in demand as a
irer, ills salary at Cornell Is less
than (19,000, but his lecture receipts make
fference between his regular
tlon and thr> sum of $10,0*
annum. No reason exists why Dr. Wheel
bould not lecture In California and
gather In a f. w thousand dollars on the
Dr. Jordan occasionally giv< a a
breezy talk on the lecture platform, and if
ea not get paid for hi.-- discourse it
is because he lacks sagacity In the field â¢>(

ANGELS RETIRE
AND
LAMBARDI REIGNS
Back to the Alhambra Go
the Italian Singers
Under Their Own Man
agement.
BY fISHTOI^ STEVENS
MOROSCO has rnme into hia
own and bo has T-ambardl.
The Lambarrlis are now
Lambardis Indeed, for the
good sipnor whose name they hear has
parted oompany with his Los Angeles
(translation: those angels) managers
and rented the Alhambra for a term of
days. Once again will these amiable
Italians pack up their clothes and
scenery and move int i the Eddy-street
theater. In the Alhambra to-night the
removal will be celebrated by a per
formance of "Mignon." So far the
Lambardi engagement has been a
hard-luck story, the result of wild man
agement. Good singers galore are in
the company. Such a bunch of princi
pals we never have heard outside of the
big organizations. Put the chorus is
bad, the orchestra worse, st.^.- man
agement still worse, and the leader
lacking in magnetism and authority.
We have been willing t<Â» applaud the
individual artist but not the ensemble.
The productions have been wanting in
distinction; they have i>>-.-n crude and
provincial. The company has needed a
manager, a weeder, a sorter, a chorus
master, a disciplinarian. Had the right
man with the right capital behind him
presented this company to San Fran
cisco there might have been another
story in the box-office. As it is, the
Lambardis have suffered pecuniary
disaster for which the town will be held
in blame by the musical enthusiasts.
The truth is there is too much opera
for San Francisco to support. Compe
tition in this line has not stimulated the
crowd, only bored It Walt a little while
and in the survival find the lit t â¦ - s t .
"Manon Lescaut" was the opera in
which the Lambardi company sang
farewell to the California last ni^ht.
A beautiful piece it is, Bcored in the
musical dialect of the day and full of
moving moments. In its class in
ferior only to the same composer's
"Boheme." How my colleagues fought
this opinion of mine when the two
were first produced here by Del Conte!
But time lias vouched the supremacy
of the "Boheme. '' "Manon" is ur
gently dramatic at times, Binashingly
orchestrated, but strenuous, too stren
uous on the whole, and too saccharine
in the last two acts. "Boheme" is a
masterpiece without an effort. But
why argue at this time of day?
"Manon" was very prettily sung and
very badly produced in the California
last night. The orchestra was better
than usual and still bad, the chorus
was the awful same. The principals
had the triumphs, which is all wrong
when Puccini writes the music and the
opera is the thing. Miss Sostegni was
almost thrilling in Manon; she missed
a lot of the part's caprice and humor
and she was anything but musical in
some of her top notes; but she gave
the character, a tremendously difficult
(.lit-, a fair Identity and easily merited
the shouts of approval that followed
her efforts in the passionate scenes.
Badaracco was exorbitantly good as
the Chevalier, much more successful
than AffOStinl of the Del Conte com
pany, for his voice was fresh and free
in the final scenes that always ex
hausted his predecessor in the part.
As the tenor role of "Boheme" belongs
to Agostini, so does this one in
"Manon" belong to Badaracco. The
rest of the cast was in no manner re
markable.
Want a Place on the Ticket.
The Social Ivabor party yesterday filed
with the Registrar of Elections a petition
for a place on the ticket at the coming
election.
The registration office will be open this
evening from 7:30 to 9:30. The Election
Commission will meet at B o"ciock to
night to examine citizens of the Twenty
eighth, Twenty-ninth and Thirty-fifth
districts as to their qualifications to serve
as election officers.
A Gun Parted Them.
' F. Calonge, 1005 Franklin street, and S.
Delote, who is employed in the Alameda
stock yards, have been friends for years.
About Six weeks ago Caloage loaned De
lote a gun valued at $200, as be was to
go hunting, and when Calonge asked for
l's return he could not get it. Yesterday
he swore" to a complaint in Judge Tread
well's court charging Dilute with felony

THE SAN FR AX CISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JUNE 29, 1899.
CHURCH BURNED
TO THE GROUND
AT HAYWARDS
Grass Fire Spreads to
the Building.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
SOS Broadway, June 28.
The Methodist Church at Haywarda was
sacrificed this afternoon to the desire to
have a glorious Fourth. Haywards is
preparing a great celebration for next.
Tuesday, and this afternoon some young
fellows were busy burning sections of dry
grass in different parts of town; this is
being done as a precautionary measure
against possible dangers from fire during
the celebration.
One of the largest of the grass plats is
on B street, near the Methodist Church.
The trrass was set on fire, and it was
thought a careful watch was being kept
to prevent it reaching any of the adjoin
ing buildings. The insidious flames, how
ever, crept along the undergrowth and
soon reached the church and burned their
way through the walls. The fire was not
discovered in the church until it hud a
good start, and the wood being so dry the
progress of the flames was very rapid.
The Volunteer Fire Department re
sponded to the call, but could do noth
ing, as the church burst into flames on
all sides. A stiff breeze ad. led to the dif
ficulties of the firemen. Bom* 1 of the
church furniture was saved, but the
building Is a total wreck. It was valued
at 12000, and was built only a few years
ago.
The question is being discussed as to
whether the church has not a claim
against thus..- who started the grass lire.
It Is not known whether they were em
ployed by the celebration committee Âr
whether they were acting independently.
SNOW ABOUT READY

Many Matters Till the New

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
r*"iS Broadway, June 2-.
Tho Board of \\ orka will prohaMy re
appoint Mr. MiiK-r Superintendent of
Streets within a couple of weeks. The
Mayor ha? boon making some inquiries
into the conduct of the Street Department
and is apparently satisfied that Mr. Miller
is competent. All kinds of pressure has
!.. en broughi to bear on the Mayor to
force him to vote for Mr. Miller, and Mr
Snow has refused to be hurried. It now
looks as though the Mayor ia ready to
act.
At this morning's meeting Mr. Dow
moved that the Miller resolution be re
ferred back to the committee of the
whole, ami this was done. This means
that the Mayor is ready to reconsider his
former action on thÂ»Â» plan to support
Miller. There was a caucus of Council
men last evening for the purpose of try-
Ing t<> induce the Mayor to vote for
Miller. It ended satisfactorily, though
with nothing definite on the part of the
r. He has state,) positively that he
not be a puppet In the hands of any
political clique, and he Is taking his own
time.
On motion of the Mayor S. H. Hare
was appointed to keep In condition the In
tersection ot Seventh and Market Btreets.
Several of the Improvement clubs have
advocated the keeping of men at certain
points for the purposi of attending to the
Btreets continually, and this la the
move in the establishment of
"c. nters."
When the members met as Police ami j
Fire Commissioners they carried out the
mmendationa discussed in committee
; ly. M. Hallahan was appointed an
extraman on No. 5 engine; the appoint
ment of Charles Hammerton as detective
is laid over; the rescinding of the ap-'
ment of the Chief of Police's clerk
is laid over; the resolution referring to
William Quigley of the detective for."
was laid over; the cases of John Rohan
and James Brannen will be discussed in
the committee of the whole; the recom
mendation of Chief Hall that extraman J.
B. Kramer l>e removed for neglect of duty
and that George Planer be appointed to
thi vacancy was also referred.

HOW TO STOP HEMORRHAGES.
Professor , Senn Explains the Best
'â¢ â¢' Technical Methods.
The lecture-room of Cooper Medical Col
lege was filled last night with a select
gathering of ladies and gentlemen, mostly
interested in the medical profession, to
hear a lecture by Professor Nicholas Senn
of the Rush Medical College. Chicago, one
of the most eminent surgeons and path
ologlsts of the present day.
The subject was "Prophylactic Hemo
stasis." or in plain words, the best means
of stopping hemorrhages. The eminent ;
lecturer talked for over an hour and was j
listened to with the closest attention.
In Introducing his subject he said: "The
intelligent selection and employment of ap
propriate and efficient prophylactic meas
ures are as important and of as far-reach-
value in surgery- as tomedjclpe.'^and 1
he went on dividing it into different heads,
including elevation, elastic constriction,
the elastic constrictor and its application,
special localities for elastic constriction
as a prophylactic hemostatic, hip joint,
shoulder joint, head, manual compression
of the aorta, digital compression, prelim
inary ligation of arteries in their contin
uity, temporary ligation of arteries, per
cutaneous temporary ligation of arteries
and veins, galvano and thermo earner and
angiotripsy.
At the conclusion of the lecture a large
number of physicians were introduced to
the lecturer by Professor Lane, and the
hope was expressed that he would permit
them to see him operate before taking his
departure from the city.
HEROIC RESCUE OF
A BRAVE YOUNG WOMAN
BOLiINAS, June 2S.â That Miss Mary
Stephens, a handsome young lady who
Is spending the summer, here, did not lose
her life in the treacherous waters of Bo
llnas Bay yesterday was due solely to her
presence of mind. Her rescue from a
perilous position was barely effected, but
without the coolness she herself mani
fested no rescue could have been possi
ble.
Miss Stephens is a girl of splendid phy
sique, an excellent swimmer, and fre
quently while bathing goes a good dis
tanve out into the surf. Yesterday after
noon shf swam as far out as the channel
and floated with the current.
When she started to return she found
that she had made no allowance for. the
strong tide running, and battle as she
would, she was slowly swept out toward
the ocean. As her strength was fast fall
ing she ceased to struggle, and, turning
on lier back, floated along crying for help.
Her shouts w.re heard by Charles Cline.a
Mill Valley painter, who rushed into the
surf, but could not overtake the girl.
Walking back to the shore, Cline ran
along the beach to a point 2(JO yards ahead
of Mis- Stephens and swam out in time
to reach her as she was being swept
across the bar. After a struggle lasting
ten minutes the brave rescuer reached
shore with his almost unconscious burden,
and sank exhausted on the sand.
The heroic act was witnessed by a large
crowd, who cheered heartily when both
were safe.

NEW YORK, June 28.â Collis P. Hunt-
Ington has undertaken another philan
thropic enterprise in the South. Within
the last fortnight he has purchased in
Hanover County, Virginia, some little,
distance above Richmond, a tract of 135>)
acres, on which he will have erected the
first reformatory for negro children In
Virginia. Save for an institution at Bir
mingham. Ala., t he entire South is said
to be barren of such institutions, and the
thousands of a race that furnishes more
than its proportion of offenders to the
Jails and penitentiaries are being cor
rupted by the contact and influence of
hardened adult negro criminals of both
Bexes.
The land lies along the Pamunk^v
River and adjoins a pk>t of about W0
acres already owned by the reformatory
association. Huntington Is careful, how
ever, to retain the title to the land "un
til such time as the institution appears
to t>e on a correel basis."

A NEW THEATER
TO BE ERECTED
FOR BELASCO
In the Heart of the
City.
Manager Belasco of the Alcazar Is to
have a new theater. He said last night
that he had signed an agreement with a
prominent business man for the erection
of a handsome building, up-to-date in
every particular, in which would be dedi
cated a grand temple of the drama.
"Last week," said Mr. Belasco, "I re
newed my lease on the Alcazar for three
years, beginning the first of August. At
its expiration I will go into a new theater,
which is to be erected for me. It will
be within a block of my present location.
I have inspected the site and looked over
the general plans. The theater will be
ready for occupancy the minute the Alca
zar lease expires. I have signed an agree
ment to that effect with a prominent busi
ness man of this city, whose name is a
sufficient guarantee that he means busi
ness. In addition to the theater the build
ing will contain a large number of lodge
rooms, and wtll be a handsome addition
to the architectural beauties of the city."
In speaking of the renewal of the lease
of the Alcazar, Mr. Belasco confirmed the
report that M. H. dc Young had doubled
the rental. In almost the same breath
he denied the equally nersistent rumor
that the hand of S. H. Frledlander of the
California Theater could be seen In the
Increase.
"If I thought that was so," he said;
"well, I will not say what I'd do. But
it isn't true."
The rumor was to the effect that Belasco
and Frledlander. who do not speak us
they jmss by, were collaborating well if
unwillingly in a new theatrical comedy
with the old title', "He Laughs Best That
Laughs Last." The first act was pre
sented to the public several weeks ago,
and made an instantaneous hit.- In it
Frledlander was discovered making his
exit P. D. Q., from the Alcazar. Belasco,
in a" towering rage, following, intent on
planting patent leather where it would
find the softest mark on the fugitive's
rear view. The prologue, unseen by the
audience, showed to the satisfaction of
Belasco that Frledlander had sought to
engage two youthful stars at that time
touring in the interior with the Belasco
& Thall company. A slap in the face,
according to all accounts, Is said to have
hastened Frledlander*s exit from the pain
fulness of the prologue Into the presence
of the public in the tirst act. The curtain
on that part of the comedy went down on
a rapidly lessening perspective of Fried
lander's coattailÃ as he outfooted the
portly Belasco.
A period of six weeks, filled by Fried
lander with a cram of Machiavelli, is sup-,
posed to have elapsed between the first
and second acts, in which M. H. de Young
a]. pears for the first time as a star come
dian. M. H. is discovered in his office,
softly cussing the Geary-street turntable,
when enters Friedlander, bearing a silver
platter, on which he makes an offer for
the Alcazar somewhat in excess of the
rental paid by Belasco.
"Hum," cou-ghed the director general,
eying it.
Exit Friedlander. chuckling. De Young.
solus, at the 'phone a minute later. "That
you, Fred? Yes? This is De Young.
I'll have to raise your rent. Got a dozen
offers for the theater. Yes. Just make it
double. Yes. 1 said a dozen. You know
me. You do. Well, that goes." Hangs up
the telephone, and scene changes to the
swearing-room in the Alcazar, where Bel
asco is making rasping noises with his
mouth as a curtain rolls up, hack, show
ing Friedlander in a blue light on a fence
smiling sardonically at his vanquished
enemy.
None of the principals, however, will
father this act. Belasco save he does not
believe it and Friedlander says he never
made an offer fur the Alcazar. The only
grain of truth, therefore, that seems to
be in the rumor lies in the fact that Bel
asco's rent has been doubled, and there's
no comedy in that, except tor De Young.

AGAINST MILITARY RULE
NEW YORK, June 2S.â That labor's
' protest against the arbitrary course
pursued by General Merriam during the

j telegram from Chicago:
Will your people join the union men of \

CHARGES MADE AGAINST
PROFESSOR M'NAUGHTON
SAN JOSE, June 28.â The investigating ;
committee of the Normal School Alumni
Association has sent a letter to Professor
MiXaughton, the new principal of the ,
school, asking- him to appear before the !
committee Saturday morning at in o'clock
and explain certain charges that have
been anonymously made against him. The '
communication states that the committee
Is Investigating the matter and would likÂ«
to have' him meet with them.
Professor MeNaughton stated this even- ;
ing he had not yet deceived the letter,
but when he did he would consider the
request. He refused to state whether he i
would appear before the committee or not,
but denounced the charges as false and j
malicious. Dr. Brown, chairman of the

charges had been preferred against Mc-
Naughton. and until the matter came \
properly before the Trustees no attention i
would be paid to the Investigation being
conducted by the Alumni Association.
OXNARD BUYS A LARGE
TRACT IN VENTURA
OXXARD, June 28.â Henry T. Oxnnr.l.
president of the American I>'<'! Sugar
Company, to-day confirmed the purcha -â â 
of tli'- Patterson Ranch tract of 5000
acres of the most fertile land in this sec
tion of Ventura County. The price was
$600,000. This will make 12/100 acres m
land owned here by the company, and
renders it independent of farmers for
beet culture. The tract will not be oper
ated by the company, but leased to small
holders.
FAVOR THE SHORT TERM.
SUISUN, June 28.â The proposed change
in the course of study in the normal
schools of the State, changing the course
from four years to two years, is excit
iiiK the intf-rfst of educator? and the â¢sub
ject is ln-itig much discussed here and
there
The members of the Board of Educa
tion of Solano County were interviewed
by Thp Call representative regarding the
matter and found them unanimously in
favor ot the change. One member re
marked "that under the present system
the normal schools are the weakest- of
all the schools of hipher education in the
American school system." It was Â»ug
g-ested that the chancre would result in
great benefit to the high schools of the
St:ite, as under the two-year course none
but high school graduates could be ad
mitted to normal schools. This, natural
ly, will cause an increased attendance in
high schools and place them on a more
substantial basis tdan many have hereto

GENERAL EAGAN REALIZES
A FORTUNE IN HAWAII
s He Sells Uncultivated
Land Bought for a
Song at $100
Per Acre.
THE Roderick Dhu brought up
a lively budget of news from
the Hawaiian Islands yester
day. There is a boom in sugar and
sugar lands there. Coffee planta
tions are being torn up and sugar
e.me planted. Land that was pur
chased from the Government for
$3 an acre is selling at from $80
to SI SO an acre. A railroad to
corrxicet the various sugar indus
tries is being built. Major Gen
eral Egan, who went to Hilo pre
pared to "haul his son over the
coals'' for selling the family cof
fee plantation, gave the young
man his paternal blessing in
stead. The son had sold the un
cultivated portion of the land,
which rost his father $3 an acre,
for SIOO an acre, and the family
still possesses the 200 acres un
der cultivation. There is no
eruption of the volcano, but there
was a cave in of the ''pit," and
for several days the people of
Hawaii had "great hopes." The
most valuable collection of bird
skins ever made in Hawaii came
up from Hilo on the Roderick
Dhu. The collection is practically
priceless. It is consigned to the
National Museum in Washington.
Several planters who sold their
holdings for fortunes came up on
the Roderick Dhu.

DODGE ADDS
TWO MILLIONS
TO THE ROLLS
Corporations to Pay
Franchise Tax.
Assessor Do<lge yesterday added over
two million to his list of taxable values |
and he performed this praiseworthy feat I
without turning, a although there is
liable to be a great deal of perspiring on :
the part of those who will be called upon
to pay the taxes on this big sum. Re- j
cently Assessor Dodge received notice ;
from the Assessors of Alameda and San j
Joaquln. counties that certain corporations |
doing business in those counties refuse j
to p.ay a franchise tax on the ground that ,
they were incorporated in San Francisco
and the tax could be levied only In this
county under the law.
The companies referred to are the re
cently consolidated water companies of
Oakland and the Stockton Gas Company.
These companies claim San Francisco as
their home, and while they have never ;
paid any franchise litre they manage to j
escape the tax in the counties where they |
Â«lo .business on this ground alone. The
Assessor of s.i Joaquin County recently
brought suit to compel the Stockton Gas
Company to pay a franchise tax, and the,
answer ot the defendant sets up that such
a tax can only be collected In the county
of San- Francisco. Mr. Dodge proposes to :
Bee that these taxes are paid.
The Spring Valley "Water Company will
also be called upon to- pay taxes on an
additional JIw.OOO. The fact was brought
to the attention of the Assessor yesterday
that the water- company had never been
a-s=rs<sed for the reservoir known as the
JJernal Heights reservoir, located near
Thirtieth street and the old Mission road.
The reservoir was promptly assessed at
the rate of $f>o,ooO valuation for two years,
last ear and this year.
Another matter of importance that has
been acted upon by the Assessor is the
wiping out "i all assessments on personal
property which is valued at less than $50. â 
Hlfl reason for doing this is that it costs
the city more to collect these taxes than
It receives Consequently, in all cases
lierenftrr where the personal property tax ;
amounts to less than 51 the tax will be 'â 
remitted, this being, regarded by the As
sessor as \ more economical than paying.
52 or $3 to â -â â  -i the money into the treasury.
Fully 3000 families are benefited by this
action on the part of the ctly, and the
Assessor, and the city is none the loser,
as the 1120,000 which these poor people
have heretofore paid Into the treasury
is more than covered In. three separate
instances by the increase in the assess
ment of commercial firmsâ increases
which have in every instances been ac
i epted without a- murmur of protest. Dr.
Dodge Bays the. city really loses- money
by collecting taxes where the amount
falls below $4. as the cost is more than
the amount turned into the treasury.

concern and has come to California to

"Everybody in Hawaii wa? selling
their land whrn wo left," said -Mr.
Hitchcock on board the Roderick
Dhu, yesterday. "Land that people
had purchased from the Government
at $3 an acre was bringing all the way
from S^'i to $l. r io an acre. General
Charles V. Eagan is down there and is
very well satisfied with the deal his

came to Hilo prepared !â â  rep

long to learn, however, that only the
uncultivated portion of the place had
been sold, and that at 41'*i an acre.

days at peace with all the world, bar

"It is not so lojik ago that General
Eagan bought that land fur a son*;,

"Two new plantations have been

Consul, and yesterday two complaints
were sworn to "in Judge Treadwell's court
for the arrest of the swindler, whose
name is Kokaku Mltsuse. The complaints
charge him with obtaining money by

The complaining witnesses are Mume
taru Hamada and Huichi Hamamaru.
From the former he got Sl* and from the
lati.-r $24. They arrived by the steamer
I'matilla on April 12, and the defendant
immediately came on board and opened
negotiations with them.
MINNIE ADAMS' TRIAL.
Prosecution Introduces Very Tame
Testimony Against the Alleged
Murderess.
The evidence against Mrs. Minnie !
Adams, accused of the murder of her In- |
fant son, John Richard Gray, is now ,
purely circumstantial. Up to date not a I
bit of direct evidence has been produced j
against the accustyl and the prosecution
is apparently becoming desperate, as
every move In the trial is warmly con
tested.
Yesterday various witnesses were
placed upon 1 the stand, but their evidence
did little toward strengthening the theory
of the prosecution. J. J. FTannagan, t<
deputy employed in the Coroner's office,
testified to finding a piece of paper in
the out building at Mrs. Adams' honjQ
which bore the odor of carbolic acid. It
is claimed that the woman took the child
into the building and held it on her knee
while she poured the acid down its throat.
Mrs. Adams claims that the child had
found a bottle of carbolic acid in the
yard and had drank it.
Frank T. Green, chemist of the Board
of Health, testified that the carbolic add
from which the child met its death was
poison and gave considerable technical
testimony.
Detective Graham and Police Officers
Armstrong and J. P. Hurlihy also testi
lied. Hurlihy was called to Identify the
accused as' a woman who had purchased
carbolic acid in Loehr's drug stort at the
corner of Geary and Devisadero streets
the night preceding the murder. When
Hurllhy left the stand the case went over
until this morning.
DESERTERS DROWNED.
Japanese Sailors Lose Their Lives At
tempting to Escape From
Quarantine.
The bodies of two Japanese sailors wore
found on the t>each near Fort Point yes
terday foreno/m tied together with baling
rope. They each wore a life preserver
marked "Nippon Main," and were evi
dently members of the crew of th.it ves
sel, which Is detained in quarantine, and
had been drowned while attempting to
escape.
Coroner Hill, assisted by Drs. Zabala
and Lawlor, performed an autopsy at the
Morgue. No evidences of disease were
discovered except a slightly swollen condi
tion of the axillary glands cm one of the
bodies, and in order to prevent the possi
bility of the bubonic plague being Intro
duced into this port the bodies were im
mediately consumed at the Odd Fellows'
Crematory.
Only Durable Inks for Invoices.
H. A. Taylor, -assistant Becretary of the
â Treasury, has notified Port Collector
Jackson and all others in the United
States that .the Secretary of State has
beÂ«n requested to instruct consular ofii
cers to refuse authentication to invoices
made in any Kind of ink except the most
durable.
Suit to Quiet "title.
Laura G. Delaney, S. W. Hoiladay and

"There has been no eruption of the
volcano. There Is plenty of smoke but
no fire. About two months ago
there was a caving In of the walls of
the pit, and there was considerable
excitement In consequence. Many
people thought there was going to be
an eruption, but they were dlsap
polnted. Th.it is probably what gave
rise to the story that the volcano was
active again.
"There is a great future for Ha
waii, but nobody seems to see any
thing .but sugar. Coffee is being rooted
up and sugar enne planted, but I
think the coffee trade will be flourish
ing when the sug;tr business is lan
guishing."
The rush of travel to the islands Is
on the increase. For the return trip
every Inch of cabin room on the
Roderick Dhu Is taken, and on the
Santiago, now daily expected, there
is only one spare berth left.
The Roderick Dhu brought up one
of the most valuable collections ->f
bird skins ever sent from the Islands.
It is consigned to the National
Museum at Washington and has taken
I 3SOI Henshaw nearly five years
to gather. Every bird that makes its
home in trTe Hawaiian group is repre
sented, and the collection is almost
priceless. It is packed with the
greatest care, and will go East by ex
press. It was watched as carefully
during the passage as it would havo
been had it been specie.

Navy Transport Solace Sails for the

for the Fleet.
The transport Valencia mailed for Ma

art-streel wharf and there was no means
of keeping the soldiers on the vessel after
they had been put aboard. In consequence
a number of them made their escape to
the neighboring saloons and when the
transport sailed a dozen of them were left
behind. An attempt was made to stop the
vessel at Meiggs wharf, but it failed, so
the deserters will be sent to the Philip

The navy transport Solace will sail for
Manila Saturday. She will carry forty
seven officers f"r the fleet in Manila Bay.
Lieutenant Cooper, with a draft of naval

in a storm, but whether Captain Henry
was killed during the gale or died from
natural causes is not known.
The deceased's family lives at 708 Golden

WORTHY OF ASSISTANCE.
Sad Case of Margaret Finney, a Dis-
charged Insane Patient.
A woman named Margaret Finney, who
has been in the Napa Hospital for the In
sane for the last twelve years, was dis
( harped as sane on Friday, June 23. She
was put on the boat, and on arriving in
this city Immediately went to British
Consul General Pickersglll and made a
pitiful appeal for assistance.
It appears that the asylum authorities
had sent her away without making any
provision for her future. She did not have
a cent of money, was without relatives or
friends and her clothes were in rags.
Consul Pickersgill had her taken to the
office of the British Benevolent Society,
which took steps to have the unfortunate
woman taken care of. She is perfectly
rational now. The society paid for a
week's room and board at the house of
Mrs. Wright, corner of Folsom and Sixth
streets;,, and that will expire to-night. She
will be cared for, however, until she can
obtain a position.
I. P. Nieto, chairman of the board of
relief of the benevolent association, In dis
cussing the case yesterday, said:
"Miss Finney is a most deserving
woman, and I am sure that if some ladies'
aid society were to take her In hand
she would appreciate it and be in every
way worthy of it. She is a native of
Kdinburgh, 32 years of age, and was com
mitted to the asylum in 1887 while she
was in the employ of Rev. Dr. Mackenzie.
She has never been violent, her dementia
being of a mild form. Our society will
not desert her in her trouble, but it seems
to me that it is a case for some ladies to
take up.
"I must say it is a shame that the asy
lum authorities should turn a poor woman
adrift without giving her some means to
get along for a short time, at least. Why,
convicts are given a suit of clothes and $5
when they are discharged from prison.
Dr. Mackenzie is out of town at present,
but I have no doubt that he would inter
est himself in the case if he were here."

But the delicate work required by th>'
railroad is not performed by the mem

' has frequently consulted with Dr. Cof-

i testimony has been invariably in favor
of the corporation. Dr. W. H. Dorr, an

son of the surgeon employed by the
Smter Street Railroad Company. The
elder Dorr was to have been a member
of the board, but he did not care to
assume the duties and secured a posi
tion for his son.
Assistant Police Surgeon Cluness is
also a surgeon in the employ of th*-
Sinter Street Railroad Company. As
sistant Police Surgeon J. 1. Stephens is
related to Dr. Barbat and may be ex
; ted not to disgrace the relationship
by any indication of independence.
The people of the city may thus si â 
the terrible network of relationships
and corrupt combinations formed to
protect the railroad from the conse
quences of any of its acts. There have
been Instances in this, city where men
and women have been run down and it
seemed alftiosi maliciously maimed or
killed by the. operators of street cars.
Witnesses have sprung up on every
side, under the spur of a brib<
swear that the railroad was n<>t i><
blame.
It is TV! difficult to tell now what
the result will be when the Receiving
Hospital Is guarded by railroad doctors
appointed to perform a certain duty
and ready to obey Instructions. The
records of the hospital are at the com
mand of these doctors. A scratch of a
pen v, ill make out of a bleeding victim
of the railroad a drunken wayfarer,
mangled through his own negligence
and by no fault of railroad employes.
A field for corruption in affairs touch-
Ing life and death has been opened to
the railroad. The men that could make
Dennery their fellow may be expected
to be easy of conscience. They have
placed the people of the city at the
mercy of the railroad. The Receiving
Hospital has been made a railroad hos
pital. Men and women may be maimed
or killed in the streets und at the Re
ceiving Hospital is a serviceable guard
of doctors who are paid by the munici
pality to protect the criminal interests
of the Southern Pacific Company.

BARBAT HOLDS
THE EDGE ON
THE OTHERS
Health Board Is All
Split Up.
RIVALCOLLEGES RESPONSIBLE
A PRETTY FIGHT TO OUST DR. G.
E. SUSSDORF.
Keeney, Coffey and Payne Ready to
Do It, but Burns' Family Physi
cian Has an Ax to
Grind.
As pretty a fight as one would wish to
see in a. lifetime is now being waged in
the now Board of Health. On the surface
it appears to be Dr. Barbat against his
colleague?-! >rs. Payne, Coffey and Kee
iuy. As a matter of fact, it is the united
faculties df the Cooper and University of
California medical colleges against the
College of Physicians and Surgeons. In
the preliminary sparring so far the "P.
and 5.," as the Fourteenth-street insti
tution is called, has had all the advan
tage. Latterly, however, its united op
ponents have developed wonderful recu
perative powers and the contest promises
to go the limit to a draw.
In such an eVent one man will be happy.
He is Dr. <;. E. Sussdorf, the present
superintendent of the City and County
Hospital. The longer the fight lasts the
i r he will hold office, and should it
end up with no decision he will continue
in his place. Three members of the Board
of Health have intimated their wish to
create a vacancy by disposing of him. the
intention being to appoint as his suc
cessor Pr. David E. Hodghead, who has
an office In the McNuti Hospital on Sut
ter street and 1b the candidate of I>r.
Wlnslow Anderson, dean of the faculty
of the College of Physicians and Surgeons.
The fourth niemli. r of the board, Dr.
Barbat, Is perfectly willing to pet rid of
lorf. but refuses to budge in that
direction until he is absolutely certain
that !.â â¢ candidate of the "P. and S." will
get the place.
Barbat announced himself to that ef
fect a week ago last night. At a secret
meeting of the board to oil the toboggan
â¢ â¢ doomed employes of the Health
Departmeni it was proposed to oust Suss
dorf. Keeney, Coffey and Payne voted in
the affirmative; Barbat in the negative,
stating that he knew it to be the purpose
of his colleagues to elect Hodghead. He
said he had nothing persanalh against
Hodgnead, merely opposing: him as the
candida!. of a college. Dr. Barbat's stand
d it. It takes four votes to create a
vacancy, and only three to elect Without
1: :ii at's vote the other three had nothing
to nil, and there they stand and are likely
nd until Dan Hums cracks the whip
and makes his family physician hunt his
hole.
Had Dr. Barbat been candid with his
CoHeagues h< would have told them that
he opposed Hodghead not because h<- was
the representative of a college but be
cause he was the representative of the
College of Physicians and Surgeons
which is largely Dr. Winslow Anderson.
Fie could have told them also maybe th"y
know ii that the mere mention of the
name of Dr. Anderson in the presence of
Barbat Is like flaunting a red ran In front
"J a bull, ii makes Harbat bellow.
This may be because, while Hart. at Is
physician to the family of Dan Burns Dr
Anderson enjoys the full confidence of the
Mexican and has been called In on extra
ordinary occasions. It may he. that the
jaundice of professional jealousy has col
ored the feelings of the family physician
to Buch an extent that they Influence hi?
action In the Board of Health. However
that may be, it remains of record that
Bafbat, who agreed with bis colleagues
in putting a clothespin on the no.s<-> of thÂ«
Board of Health while the Hums off
scourings -were being passed into office,
does not agrei with them on the man to
be elected superintendent of the City and
County Hospital.
For the present Barbat Beetns to have
th^ whip hand: His colleagues have the
three votes necessary to elect Hodghead,
but not the four needful to oust Sussdorf.
The principal Interest th<> Cooper and
California college faculties have in the
fight is against further encroachment of
the College of Physicians and Surgeons
on what they have considered their par
ticular preserve. For that reason they
support Barbat in his opposition to Hodg
head. who rr presents the P. and fi.
They know that with Sussdorf out' of the
way. Dra Keeney, Coffey and Payne
would put In, If not Hodghead, some other
P. and S. candidate: The action of
ih^ three physicians at a meeting on tho
very night on which they first tried to
oust Sussdorf, Barbat showed that. Dr.
Payne introduced an Innocent looking res
olution to the effect that the College of
Physicians and Surgeons be allowed equal
privileges at the City and County Hospi
tal with the medical department of the
University of California and Cooper Med
ical College; also that it have the privi-
Lege of appointing one visiting physician
and one visiting Burgeon without pay;
and. further, to appointt an equal numbi r
Of graduates as internes.
The resolution was adopted with only
one dissenting vote (Barbat's)/ but the
fact that the triumph was not without op
position made it none the less bitter for
the opponents of the College of Physicians
and Surgeons, which had at lÃst won Its
long fight and was finally on equal foot
ing wiih the others.
Wiih Sussdorf out and Hodghead in the
I", and S. would be cock of the walk, with
the . others nowhere. It remains to be
seen whether or not Barbat can hold the
fort.

The first witness to be callpd was A. S.
Baldwin of the Glen Park Company,
whose letter acted as a reveille to Robin
son and the Bleeping committee â out of
session. Up told a plain, unvarnished and
unimpeachable tale, of how- Chretlejn had
come to him. saying that Robinson had
sent him for the $50 draw-down, which
was his due for work done in securing- the
fireworks show for Glen Park. <'hfeii-n
said, according to Haldwin, that if Robin
son was to get $.V). why he deserved ten
times as much. Thia statement took
Baldwin's breath away. He .saw th.athe
was up against one who dared and h3
begged a stay of proceedings for a day.
Baldwin told the Inquisitors-' that â 'Chretien
took alarm at this and sought subterfuge
hy requesting Baldwin, to Rive the $f>o in
form of a check payable to Robinson, If
he intended to give it at all. .
This Chretien said would cinch Robin
son and expose his vile and corrupt
methods. Witness said he Immediately
Hales.
wrote Robinson the letter which was pub
listu'i] yesterday.
Robinson turned it over to Fletcher.
With Chretien, these two called upon
Baldwin Tuesday night. The latter then
told his Btory to Fletcher In the presence
.of Robinson and Chretien. Robinson
claimed thai Chretien had repeatedly ap
proached him. adjuring a collection of $50
from Baldwin, but the colonel thought he.
referred to the subscription as moii'-y to
be paid in the general treasury of the
committee. Chretien's story was that
I Robinson goaded him on to get the rake
: down which was due him personally for
I work done.
"With those varying tales," Paid the
witness. "I could see no other outcome
than a mingling of fists. I told them that
the He had been passed and that there
was but one possible thing to do. I of
fered my parlor, sitting and dining rooms
as an upholstered ring, but they both sat
there, mute and Inactive. I then sug
gested the back yard or the street, neither
of which places seemed to suit their fan
cies. One was certainly lying."
.Colonel Rohiifson was called in and told
his story, â which was to the effect that he
thought all along that the money which i
Chretien referred to was to go into the
Fourth of July fund. Chretien then testi- j
Bed and his version made- himself the |
emissary of Robinson to secure the $50, I
which he admitted was to be given for a .
personal end. This point he could not .
explain. : Cross examination and other
testimony added cumulative. facts to Bald
win's evidence. -;It' was ; also Intimated
that Chretien' had ' secured $1.0 from â  a

The upmar that ensued upon the ron
.cluslon of the reading of the report re
pembkd an anarchist riot,, and compara
tive quiet was restored only after th^
chairman had demolished his' mallet rap
pinp for order. . '
â  There had- been no stenogrraphlc report
of the investigating' c<immlttee's labors,
so the trial had to practically bo repeated
â before the executive committee. The first
two findings were disposed of. Raabe
Hales.
was exonerated and the Robinson clause
was adopted, but Chretien's case had to
be wholly retried. The witnesses were
again examined in toto. Fight as they
would, Chretien's followers could not
stem the tide, and Chretien's head came
off.
Then occurred a piece of fierce jugglery.
The report as prepared by the Investigat
ing committee was thrown aside and on a
motion by James O"Gara Colonel Robin
son's head fell into the basket.
Robinson was deposed as chairman of
the fireworks committee and Chretien as
vice president of the executive committee
and member of the fireworks committee.
Both were then expelled bodily from the
general Fourth of July Committee
GONE TO HER REST.
The Passing Away of Mrs. Lillian A. ;
Carlie, a Prominent Member of
the Native Daughters.
A wreath of beautiful flowers and along
streamer of purple ribbon hung: on the
: door of the Native Daughters' Home yes
terday, an emblem of sorrow for "the
; death of one of the prominent members of
; the order, of Native Daughters of the
I Golden West, Mrs.. Lillian. A. Carlle. The
. deceased, who was a sister, of the late
Frank J. Higgins. the first president of
the Grand. Parlor of the Native Sons of
the Golden West; had . for a Jong time i
prior to her demise been a great sufferer ;
; from a disease, which she knew was in
curable, Despite her Illness, she was an
ardent worker;, for the advancement of
: the order, which, 1 next to her. only son,
: she loved with an ardor, that has seldom,
if .ever, been equaled by any one in that
.organization,. and so long as she was able <
to attend the meetings of La Estrella. j
Parlor, of which she was the founder, |
she, was present to assist in the upbuild- j
ing thereof. -A' few weeks ago she at- |
tended a social function given by ; her par- ;
lor and to an intimate friend she said.;. '
"This, ;i. feel, will be the last time that I
.will see my girLs enjoy themselves. I al
ways call them 'ray girls,' for I. am their
; t'rat'-rnal mother. I feel that I am soon
to go. and while I hate to leave my darl- |
ing son and : these lovable girls, . I am j
ready -when the summons comes. 1 " A few ;
days after that she became. so ill that she
was taken to the home, where at 5. .o'clock
on last Tuesday afternoon she -peacefully
passed away. \ .., â : â  â  .; . .':' : .â¢ '
Mrs. I'arlie was an unusually ' bright
'â  woman, highly educated; one of high ar- :
tistic taste, a fluent writer and possessed
of fine voice,' which she frequently' used 1
to charm the members of the parlors. She
â was a regular attendant at all the grand i
parlor sessions;' and. being well versed in
legislation rendered valuable assistance in
framing laws for the order. She was the
composer of one of; the odes now in use,
and for which she was awarded, a prize. ]
i But owing to her illness her absence at
the last held Grand Parlor.was noted, and
many were: the words of sympathy ex
pressed.- For several terms she was one
of the grand trustees of tho Grand Parlor. .
Shortly before her death she called to
â¢ her. bed.slde some of the sisters in th.3
I order and gave them directions as to how
her funeral should be conducted, and her
wishes will be carried out under the
auspices of the members of La Estrella
Parlor. She was a native of Columbia,
Tuolumhe. County, and was In the forty
third year of her age. The funeral will
be held from the home at 2 o'clock this |
afternoon.
