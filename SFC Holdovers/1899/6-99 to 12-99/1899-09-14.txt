killed. Engineer E. XV. Wright was
fcadly burned and scalded. The fireman
is not expected to recover, and a track
walker, name unknown, was also badly
injured. One woman was also slightly
injured.
The caboose belonged to the Porter
vflle freight. It was standing on the
main line when struck, where it had
teen switched a short time before. It
appears that the passenger train was
going at full speed when it struck the
caboose. Famoeo is a Sag station, and
the train had no occasion to stop there
-
The mail and bag-gage cars were
badly wrecked and the caboose smashed
to Cinders.
Fireman Keeler Jumped and was se
verely injured. Engineer Wright was
pinioned against the head of the en

man in the front end of the caboose had
a splinter run through his wrist.
Mrs. Haggle llajora was instantly
killed; also llrs. Ross, her mother. The
other woman who was killed is un
known, but she is believed to be ilrs.

ROME. Sept. 13.â An official note an- ;

The arrangement, which comes Into
force forthwith, caused various comment. \
It is supposed that the decision is due to
the advice of his physicians. One of the

THERE WAS NO NECESSITY FOR
WAR IN THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS
General Reeve
Says Otis Was
Inconsiderate
Natives Were Ignored
and Made Enemies
Instead of Friends.
PEN'ERAL. C. lIcC REEVE, who
| sailed from San Francisco June 27.
I _ :â â¢â  as colonel commanding 1 the
I 7- ----- Minnesota Volunteers,
V_-^ and who was subsequently pro
moted to the rank of brigadier general for
meritorious conduct in action, 13 a fre
cjuent and welcome visitor in the camp
of -he aOnnesotaa at the Presidio.
Shortly after the occupation of Manila
by the American troops General Reeve
was assigned to duty as chief of police,
and while serving in that capacity met
many of the leading merchants and pro
fessional men of the city of Manila.
At the Occidental Hotel yesterday the
general was asked on behalf of The Call
to express his opinion touching 1 the situa
tion of affairs in the Philippines. He re
luctantly consented to an interview, but
desired at the outset to disclaim any in
tention to criticize the national policy of
dealing with affairs in the archipelago, or
to pass judgment on the direction of mil
itary operations on the island of Luzon.
He was willing to speak of what he saw
and heard while on duty at Manila and to
express his judgment regarding the capa
city of Filipinos for self-government.- On
these topics he remarked:
""When 1 was appointed chief of police
of a city of 320.000 inhabitants I deemed iz
wise to ascertain as soon as possible
somekfns definite and to the point re
garding the character, traits, disposition
and intelligence of the natire population.
Accordingly I sought the counsel of the
leading English. Scotch and German mer
chants. They told me that the Filipinos
were intelligent, industrious, peaceable
and fond of home life. Personal investi
gation convinced me that the natives
were engaged in all branches of industry.
In the professions at law and medicine
were many of the natives.
"The best dentist in Luzon was an
oScer in Aguinaldo's army. In tie
field :: mechanical and rail-way pur
suits the Filipinos were active and
promisine. I ~as surprised to ascer
tain that the diffusion of knowledge
was general. The percentage of na
tives able to read and write was large.
The enrollment of students in the
San VoaÃÃfl and Dciiin::T a
ties and the attention paid to such
branches of knowledge as law, medi
cine, liberal arts and civil engineer
ing excited ny surprise. Five thou
sand students were enrolled at the
Dominican University. I mention
these facts to dispel the impression
that the Filipinos are ignorant and
unlettered savages. Throughout the
provinces in the island of Luzon good
common schools and high schools are
maintained, the teachers being 1
native priests."
General Reeve was asked what was the
disposition of the natives toward Ameri
cans, and what progress the Filipinos had
made in the direction of self-government.
"In the provinces." said General Ri?-?ve.
â¢â¢â w* found courts and schools established
and fnund local authorities administer
ing affairs of government. Hen? was a
system of collecting taxes and disbursing
the money so collected in the interests of
the governed. The disposition of the na
tives was that of extreme friendship
toward Americans. In the city of Mi
nila the Filipinos, especially those who
were wealthy, were anxious to remove
the impression that they were ignorant of
the requirements of modern life and the
usages of civilization. They readily ex
tended the hospitality of their homes to
American officers of the military and civil
- -
"Did General E. 8. Otfs object to the
interchange of social amenities?"
â¢There was no official objection, but it
wa3 well understood at headquarters that
these social visits excited the displeasure
of General Otis. One incident I particu
larly recall. General Garcia, though an
officer of Aguinaldo's army, invited me
to a fitsta at CaloocaTi. yaite a number
of officers accepted the invitation, among
them Colonel Frost of the South Dakota^.
Vv"e were entertained most hospitably.
The after dinner speeches evidenced many
sentiments of friendship. A full account
of the function was published in the Ma
nila newspapers. The topic was discussed
at headquarters and the officers who at
tended were not commended. Thereafter
it was chilly for those who exchanged
social greetings with the Filipinos.
"While I was General Garcia's
guest," resumed General Reeve. '-I
met an officer of his staff who spoke
English fluently. Naturally the fu
ture of the islands was the topic of
conversation, which brought forward
the question whether the natives were
capable of self-government. General
Garcia's talk was interpreted. He fa
vored a policy of permitting the na
tives to test their ability to govern
themselves under the protection of
the United States. The same senti
ments were expressed by Aguinaldo.
At Maiolos in October I saw Aguin
aido and had extended talks with him.
Then he did not signify r desire that
the Filipinos should have absolute
independence at once, but expressed
the thought that protection guaran
teed, by the United States would be
acceptable. He had in mind that
the natives should conduct the local
government and the United States
should protect them against foreign
oppression or interference. When
Aguinaido was asked if the Filipinos
were united on that point he frankly
said no. but assured us that he could
bring the dissenters into line. He
said one party was for absolute in
dependence while the other party fa
vored a protectorate."
General Reeve was asked if thÂ» blood
shed â the conflict of armsâ could have
been averted by an. intelligent policy of
conciliation, and to the question he re
plied: , - :â :â :;;â¢;:;

the proposition that the insurrection must '

ciliatory course was net adept*-!. General :
Otis' unfortunate proclamation at Jan- !
vary 4 rendered conciliation almost irn
â  possible. He adopted the policy of pa r- J
ing the natives, of treating- them as half
civilizfid savages. No indication wa:s jriv^n j
to the Filipinos as to the future intentions j
of the Government. In August, September :
and October immediately following the j
capture of Manila the Filipinos kept in- i
quiring what we were going to do. and our â

Filipinos would ask," 'What will you do If !

hint was given to them by General j
Otis until it was too late. He ' IÂ«
--nored them completely. At every step
at thÂ« pÂ«?ace negotiations he stipulated
that nothing should be considered until
the Filipinos laid down their arms. Here
in is where the natives mistrusted the
Americans. The Filipinos had many les
sons from Spain in the folly of laying
down arms. They were not a. - to com
prehend the difference 111 I win â  Spanish
and American promises.
""While Agninaldo was seeking to
obtain from General Otis some outline
cf the future policy of the United
States the war party in the Cabinet,
headed by General Luna, was gain- j
ing strength daily. Instead of Aguin- j
aldo controlling those who demanded
absolute independence the parties â 
making the demand succeeded in get
ting him tinder control.
"Admiral D*;*"- entertains a high opin
ion of the industry a: I intelligence of rhe
natives. He employed many of them st
Cavite Arsenal and spoke highly of them.
The natives expressed great admiration
for the admiral. He holds to the opinion
that the Filipinos are capable of self-gov
ernment and in my judgment he firmly
believes that the war could have been
honorably avoided by an enlightened pol- â 
icy of conciliation In dealing with the na- â 
tives. The Filipinos are much better fit
ted for independence and self-government
than, are the Cubans. It is my under
standing that Admiral Dewey has on sev
eral occasions stated that the Filipinos
were capable cf setf-govemmer.t and that
a wise policy of conciliation would have
averted the war against the natives."
Doubtless . the American public j
would read with much interest a dis- <
patch which Admiral Dewey cabled to .
the President last December in re
sponse to a message wired by the
President requesting the . admiral's :
views of i the situation in the Philip
pines".
Regarding the apprehension that the na
tives were bent on pillage, riot and murder i
in Manila, General Reeve said there never |
pas tee sugntest danger m that direction.
There were five, thousand insurgents- in
he city at the time qt the American, cc
rupation. On the Calle ReaL they had as
iiany posts as the" Americans had and not
in aet^f rioting or pillage was reported. â¢

NEW YORK. " Sept- 13. â The funeral
of Cornelius Vanderbilt, who died yes
terday morning. is to be held at 10 â 
o'clock on Friday morning: in St. Bar

The main body of the church, includ

to be reserved for the members of the
family and -the associates of Mr. Van

charitable institutions in which he was
directly i-'erested. The pew 3 opening

The. music at the church will be fur

mediately after the service the casket
will be taken to the foot of Forty-sec
ond street, where a boat is to be in
waiting' to convey the funeral party to
Staten Island for the burial at New
dorp in the Vanderbllt tomb. The
party is to be numerous enough to SO
twenty coaches.
Senator Depew to-night denied the
report which had gained currency that
Mrs. Vanderbilt was dangerously ili.
Mr. Depew said that she had suffered
from shock, as was natural, but was
in good health to-night.
A death mask was taken to-night by
a representative of Augustus St. Gau
dens, who will make a bust.
There has been no word from Alfred
G. Vanderbilt. who was cabled to at
Yokohama. Japan.
"Mr. Vanderbilt's death will have no
effect on the Vanderbilt properties/*
said Mr. Depew to-day. "William K.
Vanderbilt, w?lth his brother's consent,
took his position at their head two
years ago. Nothing will have to be
sold in the settlement of the estate. Mr.
Vanderbilt's life was not insured."
The friends of the family are yet la
ignorance of the provisions of the wilL
Mr. Depew said that William K. Van
derbilt i 3 in charge of everything, aa
he is the head of the family.
A gentleman familiar with the Van
derbiit interests said to-day: "No on<s
knows the exact value of Corneliu3
Vanderbiit's estate. Although he kept
his properties carefully itemized he
could not tell their value, as the values
fluctuated. His estate increased about
one- third in value during the last eight
een months. I do not think the sen
eral public will be made familiar with
the items of his estate. some time the
gross value of it may be known, so as
to comply with the law concerning the
inheritance tax. but I don't believe the
estate of Cornelius Vanderbilt will be
laid bare as was that of Jay Gould. It
is also probable that several trust funds
have been formed under the will, so
that the estate may be entailed for at
least two generations. Mr. Vanderbilt
left some large sums to charitable pro
jects, undoubtedly, and these figures
may be made public. I would not be
surprised if a special trust fund had
been formed for the benefit li the in
fant son of Cornelius- Vacderbilt Jr."2

NEW YORK, Sept. 13.â General
Howard Carroll and Lieutenant
tnander Fremont returner! to
day from Washington, whither
they had gone to consult with the Navy
Department and the Secretary of the
Treasury regarding the participation in
the parade of ships of war and revenue
cutters.
General Carroll Eaid that the Treas
ury Department would assign as many
revenue cutters as the commission
wantedâ up to six or eightâ and that
Captain Hodgson, commander of the
Mc<*ulloch a t Manila, would be In com
mand of the revenue cutter division.
The warships are to proceed in single
column formation. The yachts division,
being commanded by Eldridge T. Gerry,
wIH proceed in single column forma
tion and small yachts will follow in
double column formation. Large ex- !
curslon steamers will come m-xt in sin
gle column and tugs and smaller ex
cursion steamers in double column.
Much anxiety has been felt over the
possible inability of thp naval commit
tee to keep the excursion boats in line.
This haa happily been settled. Lieu- |
t'-nant Commander Fremont, who is!
supervisor of the harbor, hap unearthed j
mi old law that provides for the con
lUCt of captains of craft during a re
, iow or parade. Under that law a mas
; who disobeys the orders of rightful
i uthortties is subject to arrest and re
â¢ion of his license. In case of the
ait parade the proper authorities
uill be the police patrol boats.
General Roehn has not yielded his
position in regard to the line for the
l;ind parade. He still holds that Fifth i
avenue is the only street, and will try 1
arid convince the other members of the
plan and scope committee at a meeting
to decide the question on Friday.
Captain Dulicken of the British
steamer Clan Robertson, which arrived
from Glasgow to-day, is an enthusias
tic admirer of Admiral Dt-wey. and of
ihe reception committee sixty of
Beers and men to participate in
the parade. The Clan Robertson is
ned by natives of India, who will
nt a novel appearance in their
uniforms, with chiefs of different
astes in red sashes,
"In February last," says Captain
Dulicken, "we met the United States
transport Grant bound to Manila with j
troops. One of my officers dropped
over the side and there painted on her
side in letters two feet high. 'Good
Luck,' at which the troops cheered us
heartily."
In response to an official invitation
of toe city, Sir Thomas .Upton to-day
Ff-nt a letter' of acceptance. He has
planned for_the lighting of his yacht
Erin on the night of the naval parade
with 3000 Incandescent lights. Swung
between two masts the word "Erin"
will be spelled in big letters made of
incandescent lights. At the foremast
the. Shamrock's flag will be set up flat
as a transparency, and at the main
mast head will be a like transparency
of the stars and stripes, both of which
will be lighted from within.
GIBRALTAR, Sunday, Sept. 10.â The
flagship Olympia, with Admiral Dewey
on board, left to-day for New York di
rect. On Friday the admiral, accom
panied by Flag Lieutenant Brumby
I visited the srhoolship Saratoga, where
thÂ« apprentice boys received him with
j due honors and on his departure gave
three hearty cheers.
The admiral then visited the training
ship Alliance. Commander Albert Ross
and the other officers, in special full
drt-Hs uniform, received him on the
quarter deck, after which Admiral
DeWejj Inspected the crew at quarters.
j He was very much pleased with the
fine nppearance of the ship and its
I fivw. The admiral quite won the hearts
of t"he boy?. This was especially il
lustrated by one incident which, while
a lad one, brought out the admiral's
Interest in them. o n the morning of
his visit, while lowering a boat, the lan
yard oh the detaching fork parted and
one end of the boat dropped into the
water, throwing a boy from the boat
overboard and breaking his right
leg badly below the knee. The boy's
name is Ritchie s. Maddock, and it was
I with rare nerve that he swam to a

being taken into the boat he said his
leg hurt and it was then discovered
that the limb was broken. The boy
was taken to sick bay. The doctor
asked if he wanted anything and the
boy, looking around, said:
"1 want to see the admiral when he
comes on board."
The doctor told him he would ask
the admiral to come to the sick bay
When the admiral went around the ship
he saw the boy and told him it was
too bad he had had an accident, but
that they would take him home on the
Olympia. The boys face fairly beamed
with pleasure. Later some of the other
boys told the doctor they would like
to have their legs broken, too, if they
could go home with the admiral.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 14, 1599.
GOLD PLENTIFUL ON THE
BEACH AT CAPE NOME
Mining Is Carried on in a Primitive "Way, but
Hundreds of Inexperienced Miners Are
Making a Good Living.
This view Is taken from the west bank of the Snake River, and shows the business section of the town In the distance.
ANVIL CITY. Alaska, Aug. 21.â Upon
Interviewing miners, merchants
and professional men, I find that
they all agree upon one point and
that is that the Cape Nome min
ing district is the richest place on
the Pacific Coast, if not in the world,. for
where is there another place where an
inexperienced miner can take an old-fash
ioned rocker and take out from the sands
on. the beach "from $10 to $100 per day?â
such is the case here. There are 1000 or
1200 men now working side by side on the
beach, near the mouth of Snake' River.
How long this will last is a speculation,
but as the beach prospects good for
many miles in each direction it is natural
to suppose that it will hold out for two
or three years, at least, but that depends
also on the number, of men and the means
employed In working it. The deposits of
gold lie in "pockets" in the richest spots
and are also scattered freely ; among the
sands in other places, as though it has
been thrown up by the action of the
waves. ':?â â .â ".
The miners are a good-natured lot of
men and all classes and nationalities are
represented, with the exception of Chinese
and Japanese. Men who " come here .to
practice law or medicine are found among
them working with the pick, shovel, rock
er and pan. There has been but very lit
tle trouble among them and this i.-' re
markable from the fact that they are as
"thick as bees" at the richest points, and
one man Is allowed only as much ground
as he can compass with his shovelâ when
this is worked out he finds another place.
In most instances \ the pay streak is
found, from five feet to seven feet from
tin* surface In a ruby sand deposit ' and
agMn deeper on a clf/y formation, which
acis as a bed-rock; there is no. gold found
pnder this Quicksilver, copper . plates
arid blanket s are used to catch It, as the
gold is very fine and the sand extremely
heavy; much gold is lost by being washed
over and in time this ground will be all
reworked.
A week ago Lieutenant Wallace M.
Craigie, who is stationed here with twen
ty men of Company E, Seventh Infantry,
from Fort Sheridan, 111., arrested '.'-â¢;
beach miners on a complaint sworn out
by the Cape Nome Mining Company, who
claimed the beach where the miners were
at work. The men were placed in the
unfinished barracks .now being built for
the soldiers, but were soon released and
returned to their work, as the Cape Nome
Mining Company was not ready to prose
cute them and had not figured on feeding
puch a body of men at Alaska prices, and
It is now thought that there will be noth
ing further done, for as Lieutenant
Cralgie Informed be. he had received in
structions from Captain Walker at St.
Michael that the beach was open back to
high-watermark. -. '--, â¢â "':â .â - -..<
Too much cannot be said in praise of
the manner in which Lieutenant Craigie
has managed affairs here. He is a very
intelligent young man, anil with the men
under him Is held In high esteem by all
classes here. He informs me that there
PRUDENCE
NOW URGED
BY IRELAND
Has Sympathy for Dreyfus,
but Would Not Unjustly
Criticize France.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ST. PAUU Minn., Sept. 13.âArch
bishop Ireland to-day, asked for his
opinion on the meeting to protest
against the verdict of the Renneg court
martial, said:
"It is my belief that public meetings
in America such as it is proposed to
hold for the puipose of protesting
against the sentence of the Rennes
court-martial are untimely, unfair to
France and likely to breed regrettable
ill-feeling between that country and
our own, I shall not deny that I had
always in my heart deep sympathy for
the unfortunate officer who has been
under trial in Rennes, and that I had
wished and hoped that the sentence of
the court would be one of acquittal.
Hut it is another question to face the
verdict of the court the moment that
verdict has been declared with the as- i
sertion that it 1*? plainly against truth
and that the court from which it is
sues is guilty of base injustice and sac
rilege â perjury. And it is still more so
another question to lay upon Franco
the crime of the verdict, if crime there
be in it, and to throw at a whole people
and at their government insulting epi
thets. Let us wait.
"This whole matter belongs to the in
ternal life and to the Internal adminis
tration of France, and international
courtesy as well as justice bids us talk
about it very carefully and very slowly.
France is a proud, sensitive nation. She
will deeply resent, as it is her right,
undue criticism and hasty judgment of
her acts by a foreign people and es
pecially will she resent, as it is surely
her right, any uncalled for interference
with her internal administration and
any imprudent challenging of her na
tional honor. France has been our
friend for ages. She was our friend
when no other nation befriended us.
She is our friend to-day. She is a sis
ter republic. We should pause long and
\ Spei Correspondence of The Call-
View of Anvil City, Alaska.
i is but little sickness, there being but
; ! three men now in the hospital and their
complaints being nothing worse than
dysentery. Thlfl speaks very well for a
community of 4000 people.
Ah f< r the claims on Anvil, Snow Dex
ter and Glazier creeks, I can only Bay
, that they are fulfilling the highest ex
pectations. Dr. Kettleson, who owns sev
eral rich claims, showed me a pretty nug- i
I get worth $91. He found it on the riffles |
in the sluice boxes on his claim at No. i
"7 above on Anvil." He would not state
what he had* taken out, but gave me to
understand that H was no small amount.
He Is working twenty-five mt-n on No. 7.
M- ssrs. Lindblom and Linderberg own
the richest claims so far developed. They
have takes out over $100,000 already and
i have six weeks' time yet before the Bea
; son closes. Mr. Lindblom arrived at Kot
i zebue Sound last Bummer as a common
sailor. Here he parted company with his
: ship In the manner sailors sometimes do
' and afterward drifted over here in time
â¢ to stake several claims on the best creeks.
He has a nugget, picked up on his claim,
"Discovery on Anvil." that weighs $312 06.
Three lucky boys from Stockton, Cal.,
are F. \V. Butters, who lives at 1236 Bast
Webber avenue, and Charles and Foster
Peake. They came here on the Garonne,
June 22 last, and on July i) took a three
years' "lay" on No. y Dexter. Up to date
they have cleaned up $SOOO. Of this
1 amount they get about one-half, the bal
ance goinK to the owner of the claim,
i They have had only three hours' sluicing,
there being not enough water In the creek
: to work the sluices. Since then they have
carried the pay dirt on their backs in
ttve-gallon cans Pun feet to water, where
1 they rocked it out. From August 16 to
]s they took out eighty ounces or $1289.
: Tb.e pay streak is about two feet from the |
surface. Mr. Butters says that they have
$6000 to $7""" now on the "dumps" waiting
for i']Â» September rain. The claim 1k
owtifd by Leo lioewenberg, who at one
i time was gardener for Adolph Sutro at
i the Heights. The largest nugget taken
! from tins claim weighed $2>Â». The boys
have the most comfortable and best ar
ranged camp in the district.
Mr Streeter, formerly a bank employe
at; San Francisco, has a "lay" on 5 and S
on Dexter. He is also doing well. These
claims are about, six miles from Anvil
City.
Anvil Creek derives its name from a
large anvil-shaped rock which stands out
very prominently on the top of a moun
tain at the hr-ad of the stream.
There are a number of other claims be
ing worked, but. owing to the great ex
pense attached to taking in supplies to
the creeks in summer over the "tundra,"
a wet, spongey combination of moss, soil
and rank vegetable growth, there will not
be much work done until next summer.
This winter supplies of all kinds will be
taken In over the snow by dog and horse
teams and then work will be done on a
much larger scale. Many claim owners
an now waiting lor the winter's Bnow
before doing anything more than pros
pi cting.
Wages are good, laborers on the claims
getting $7 to $8 per day with board. In
town they get $1 per hour for such work
as unloading freight from vessels, which
is done by means of barges or lighters.
Such work as carpentering demands $150
seriously before blaming, suspecting- or
offending France.
"I can well understand and explain
the present happenings in America. The
American people are most easily
aroused to sentiments of justice and
humanity. Prudence, however, is the
queen of all virtues, and we should
strive to make it ours.
"In what I say I speak as an Ameri
onn, for what I believe to be the good
of America. I make no plea for France,
although, because I know France, I love
her, despite her faults, and I hope for
her despite her perils."

Anvil City lias grown from a few Indian
huts found here In June to a population of
something like 3000, and every boat brings
fresh annals from up the Yukon River
or the States. There are supplies enough
now in sight to last through the long
eight months' winter. The Alaska Explo
it tion Company has two large buildings.
100x40 feet each. One is to be used for v
warehouse and tli" other as a retail store,
The company has at present a $30,000
stock. The Alaska Commercial Comapny,
the North American Transportation and
Trading Company, Clafiin Bros, and
Simpson <V Co. will car*- large stocks of
supplies, which, with the smaller stores.
Will be sufficient to meet the demands for
this winter.
There will bo about 2000 people who will
winter here and the remainder will look
for a warmer climate. Here the ther
mometer drops to 60 degrees below
zero and has a tendency to stay
thÂ°re for many days at a time,
which, with the heavy winds that
come in from the ocean, makes this an
undesirable winter resort. For fuel drift
wood Is found in abundance along the
beach. This, with a eood supply of coal,
will keep tho people comfortable in prop,
erly constructed hnus. s. This is the main
feature and should be looked to more
carefully than it is at present. Some are
now putting up winter quarters, others
promise to fin so later on.
Lan* & Price, who own some very rich
claims, haw put up a large warehouse
for their own use besides cabins to live
in. These people took out the first cold
from Anvil City. Mr. Price arrived at St
Michael with $in.mo early in the season.
Since then they have been working a large
body >>f men, and have apparently been
wfll satisfied with the returns. "Young
Mr. Lane is a ?or\ of a part owner of the
Utica mine In California.
There is a good opening here now for a
bank, water works and an electric light
ing and power plant, all of which we will
surely have before another year passes
The larger streams are well Btocked
with such fish as salmon trout and grail
ing. Grouse are plentiful on the low hills
which helps out the frenti meat supply
Rev. Mr. Wlrt, a clergyman well known
throughout California for the good he has
done, spent several days here in company
With Captain Hihbard. He held services,
visited the mines and made himself quit*
popular wiht the people. He intends
building a church and hospital, which the
town needs badly.
For several days we have been having
heavy winds and rain, which have playen
havoc with the vessels in the harbor and
the tents and goods along the beach. The
smaller craft have gone to Sledsre Island
about thirty miles distant, for protection.
This island is about ten miles off shore
and thirty miles southwest from Anvil
<"ity. It contains about 200 acres. A num
ber of times this summer the small pas
senger and freight vessels plying between
here and St. Michael have been compelled
to seek shelter for a few hours.

TALENT HAS
GOOD DAY AT
SACRAMENTO
First Choices Gain a Clean
Sweep Excepting the
Double-Team Event.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 13.â The card this
afternoon was a trifle off color, but the
usual large crowd was In attendance, spec
ulating quite as freely as if the fields were
composed of stake horses instead of plat
ers. First choices in the betting almost
â¢ scored a sweep, taking all but the double
team event.
This latter' number, the first called,
proved quite an attractive feature. Mar
guerite and Fanny Putnam, driven by
Jeffries, enjoyed the honors of favoritism
when the horses lirst scored up for the
word, but never cut much of a figure in
the race. The Sacramentans strung their
coin on the chances of "Vet" Tryon be- j
hind Primrose and Regina F, and it was !
liko receiving a legacy from a long lost
uncle, for the pair cakewalked in two
straight heats. George Berry held the
reins over Dr. Frasse and Mamie Riley
hooked to an "ordinary" and his pair, the
only duo using the diagonal gait, made a
brilliant showing, twice finishing a credit
able second,
There were but five contestants for the
2:IS class trot. Before the first heat, a
light plunge chopped the 4 to 1 chalked
against Lynall from fours to 2 to 3 and
the mare turned up the ultimate winner,
after losing the second heat to the cranky
going Azalea. The latter rocks and sways
like a scow schooner with a broken rud
dor, but did manage to win the second
h^at from the favorite, both running un
der the wire. Maud Newman made quite
a bid for the final heat, but became be
calmed in the sail home to the wire. Best
time 2:22? 4 .
The first run was a six and a half
furlong sprint, for which Alaria, with
Tommy Butler up, closed a top-heavy fa
vorite. Alter indulging Shellac and Ma
jor Cook with the Lead to the stretch, But
ler let out his wraps and the first choice
rolled in five lengths before the ;W to 1
shot Jack McCabe, with Mounce in the
saddle. Nonchalance ran third.
A dreary-eyed looking bunch of maid
ens, two years old, followed in a five
furlong dash. The Boots entry, Enjoy
ment, was a pronounced favorite and
strangely enough Morse landed the filly
winner over Mandamus, after Tres Jolie
had cut out the pace for two-thirds of the
journey.
The event following was also a five-fur
long spin for two-year-old maidens, with
a Bit better assortment lining up. At post
time Flamote had a slight call over El
Arte in the ring. Sullivan on El Arte suf
fered from heat prostration or bookmak
ers' fright while at the post, allowing
Macklin. astride of Flamote, to beat out
Tagalog in a drive. Fairfax led Into the
stretch and then blew up.
Harry Whitman finally managed to get
his sprinter Chihuahua In with some of the
lower set. and the concluding six-furlong
run proved easy for the gelding. Under
restraint to the stretch he soon assumed
the lead, winning cleverly from Rapido.
Morse, the wizard of the saddle, with the
leg on Donator, the heavily played sec
ond choice, pulled his mount up without
apparent cause at the start and should
have been summarily punished.
The following are the entries for Thurs
day, September 14.

MEN OF THE
DIAMOND IN
GOOD FORM
Percentage of Four Baseball
Teams â Senators Still
Lead Their Rivals.
During the last few weeks the Senators
have forged to the head of the column
and they now occupy a safe first place, at
; least for some few weeks. Their strong
: opposition to leadership has been the
! local aggregation, but Hank Harris' men
have not demonstrated any great power
;of late. The blanketing hoodoo which
1 covered the Wasps for several weeks and
brought them from ilrst place to second
with a big drop was removed last Satur
i day, but it returned the day after with
: awful persistence.
! Santa Cruz and Oakland have been play
: ing most exciting and interesting ball
i ever since the beginning of the four-team
: league. Ewing kept his eyes peeled for
1 the best men of San Jose and Watson
| ville teams and the Dudes now present
i a strong front. Within a month they
have advanced up the column at a sur
prlslng rate of speed and if the late buc
\ cess continues the Crabs will have to
I fight a hard battle for third place. San
i Francisco is by no means certain of its
I hold in the place position. The next few
I weeks may see some pronounced changes
right down the line of percentages.
The standing of the teams in the Cali
fornia league is as follows:

A league whose games are attracting
attention all o\er the Tehachapl district
!is the San Joaquin Boseball Association.
: There are siv clubÃ, representing Merced,
Bakersfleld, Fresno, Visalia, Hanford and
Selma. At present Merced has a big lead,
but the rivalry among the clubs is cer
tainly intense if the enthusiasm of the
townspeople is any criterion.
An unverified rumor has beon floated
that Manager Tuttle of Santa Cruz may
take his team to Vallejo, changing the
franchise. There does not seem to be
much foundation for the story, however.
Jack McCarthy and Pat Meany will
soon be grabbed by local teams.
An interesting match will be that be
tween the HeeÃemana and the California
Volunteers, which will be played next
Sunday at the Presidio grounds. Tho
teams will line up as follows:

HELPED HIS MASTER
TO BREAK THE LAW
THE DOG RETRIEVING DYNAMITED FISH.
WORD was received yesterday at the office of the State Fish and Game
Commission that E. Mecheli had been arrested for destroying fish in
Russian River by means of dynamite. The fellow was arrested near
Cloverdale by Constable "Wilson, who caught him in the act of Violating
the law. It transpired that the man was one of four who were arrested
a year ago for a similar offense. Three were fined $230 each, but this one
escaped
A peculiar feature of the lawbreaking of the fellow was that he had an accom
plice in the ahape of a big dog, which had been trained to gather In the fish that
had been destroyed by the explosive. The animal would Jump into the river and
bring the dead fish to Its master. Constable Wilson had suspected that Mecheli
was engaged in this illegal occupation, and he resolved to watch. By a cir
cuitous route he managed to reach a clump of bushes that grew near the river
and waited for developments. The dynamiter was at his favorite pool and placed
the deadly charge in the water, where It was exploded. Dozens of fish immedi
ately floated to the surface of the water and at the command of the man the
dog plunged in and retrieved the fish, big, little and all. Wilson watched until
the fellow's basket was full and then placed him under arrest. Deputy C. A. Vo
gelsang took the illegal fisher to Ukiah for trial. The dog accompanied the pris
oner. Â»

BROOKLYN, Sept. 13.â With one run scored,

out in the ninth inning to-day, Swartwood
called the game on account of darkness. The
score, therefore, reverted to the eighth and
Pittsburg was euchred out of a hot flnis-h. The
visitors were partly to blame, as they delayed
matters by Indecision as to whether Leever
should bat or not. Sparks pitched great ball

kept the hits scattered. Attendance 2200.

BRYAN AND IMPERIALISM.
OF all public men in this country Bryan is the
least entitled to a hearing against imperialism.
When the Spanish war was being urged and
the President and nearly all others were absorbed
and anxious, wishing that honor and humane duty
only be consulted in its avoidance or precipitation,
Mr. Bryan advised his party in Congress to the ad
vocacy of measures that would bring war, "because
it would be good politics." Alter the war was on
and after it had been brought to such a speedy, satis
lactory and successful end, Mr. Bryan's principal
mouthpiece on this coast, Hon. J. Ham. Lewis of
Washington, lamented that its political benefit had
inured to the administration, saying. "We digged a
pit for our brother and have fallen into it ourselves."
In his speech in this city Mr. Bryan approached
the discussion of imperialism by saying: "I don':
want to argue this question upon the low conception
of dollars and cents. I want to declare that this na
tion cannot afford to sell its birthright for a mess of
pottage, no matter how valuable the pottage may be."
That is a very high-sounding expression: But there
is "ne conception lower than coin and pottage, and
that is the advocacy of a war because it would "be
good politic?." and in the expectation of merely par
tisan benefit. Money, in the sense of profits brought
to the country, will buy food and shelter, and we
beheve that pottage is something to eat. Battle and
â¢dshed for gain in coin may have such excuse,
though it is a poor one; but what is to be said for
war and woe. hard death on the field and harder life
under the weakness and burden of wounds, all for
tics, in the sense of gaining party ascendency, the
pleasures of power and the profits of office? That
was Mr. Bryan's conception in the crisis of 1898. It
was his idea when wise men. looking forward on the
line so far projected in history, were expressing
doubts whether our institutions would survive in their
strength a victorious foreign war. In that time of
trial, when the President was seeking to avert the
remote consequences of a war by honorably avoiding
its onset, Mr. Bryan was with those who were holding
the President up to popular contempt as too cowardly
to make war and too incompetent to carry it to vie
â 
When the Â«econd crisis came in the ratification of
the treaty of Paris, and Republican Senators had de
termine! to amend that feature. Mr. Bryan again ap
peared on the scene and in writing and speech urged
the ratification of the treaty without amendment. His
influence upon Senators of his party secured enough
Democratic votes to ratify the purchase of the Philip
p-nes.
Nothing i- more common than the amendment of
treaties, even treaties of peace. The be^t Republican
sentiment of the country was against the purchase of
the Philippines and in favor of amendment. Mr.
Bryan urged the purchase of the Philippines and
opposed the reasonable and proper policy of amend
ment. Yet. in his speech he said: "I know we can
whip the Filipinos, because Spain was a much smaller
nation than ours and she had almost finished the
job, and she had only been at it 300 years. And then
she got twenty millions of dollars for an option on
the fight when she went out."
Again, he said: "The Declaration* of Independence
says that governments derive their just powers from
the consent of the governed. If that doctrine is true
then this nation cannot acquire title by purchasing
domination from an alien monarch whose rebellious
subjects we ourselves armed to fight against that
monarch."
But when he advocated the purchase of the Phil
ippines for twenty millions, last winter, and induced
his supporters in the Senate to support it, he knew
that the Paris treaty ceded to us Spain's sovereignty
there for the price paid. He knew that we had armed
the Filipinos; he knew all that he knows now. If the
treaty conveyed no title, why did he advocate it? If
lie is so devoted and awake now to the Declaration of
Independence, why was he so oblivious to it eight
months ago? Taking him at his word that we |
pjiid the money for an option on a fight and got no i
\alid title, why did he. an aspirant for the Presidency â 
and an assumed popular leader, advocate the paying
of that high price for an option on a war and for an ;
invalid title?
It is this record deliberately made by Mr. Bryan 1
that catises his rejection by the anti-imperialists to 1
whom he stood in opposition last winter. Had he ]
then come to the assistance of Senators Hoar and ]
Wellington and other Republicans who opposed the ]
Philippine purchase on the very ground he now occu- ;
pies, there would have been no purchase of the isl- <
ands, no conquest in action now. and no occasion for i
his acute change of front on that issue. Nothing that ]
he has done more exposes his rattle-headed incon- |
sistency, his lack of principle, his truffle-hunting in- 1
stinct for expediency, than his Janus-faced course on i
this issue. whic"h he now seeks to use for his selfish <
benefit and to gain the object of his raw ambition.
THE SITUATION IN FRANCE.
â ""T^HE world never loses interest in a mystery, or !
H a semi-mystery, and about a national prisoner
I * condemned to solitary confinement in a frown-
Hing fortress or on a far island there is always mys- ;
â tery. The Man in the Iron Mask, the Prisoner of^
HChillon, Napoleon on St. Helena, and even the suc
â cessor to the Great Moguls, and Arabi Pasha isolated
lon islands in the Indian Ocean, excite and will con
â tinue to stimulate the imaginations of men and to
Hinspire prose and poetic literature.
I The worldwide interest in the case of Dreyfus has ,
Hts metaphysical origin in the secrecy of his first trial,
â the tragedy of his military humiliation and the pitiful
Incidents of the execution of his sentence by solitary
Mconfinement and non-intercourse with the world on j
HDevils Island. If he had been guillotined on his first j
Hronviction the world would have forgotten him. But j
It he press of many nations kept the solitary prisoner,
Mc'.esiccating on a torrid island under a vertical sun,
Hcontinually before the millions. So it came to pass
Hthat men and women, on their quiet pillows, around
Hthcir tables and firesides, at labor, recreation and wor-
Hship, found the appalling and pitiful figure of this
Hdoubtfully convicted and over-punished man more |
Hind more invading their thoughts and tugging at their ;
Hsympathies. Without going into the occult it may be â 
Htruthfully declared that when the minds of millions j
Mengage themselves with one thought it comes finally
Hto be concreted in some form of action, and to this ,
influence must be attributed the revision, the recall of |
Dreyfus, the retrial at Rennes and such universal at
tention to every detail as to make it the leading news
feature in the press of the world. The wish of mil
lions was transformed into their expectation. The
icquittal and vindication of the prisoner were expected. :
There was no effort made to establish in the minds
of men the difference between a court-martial and a
civil court, and so, everywhere, men are disappointed
by the absence at Rennes of the application of the
fixed rules of evidence under either the civil law and
Code Napoleon, operative in France, or the common
law of England.
It is true also that the court-martial at Rennes ad
mitted a class of evidence that would be inadmissible ;
under the articles of war of England and the United
States. These incidents, taken in connection with the
confessed forg^eVy of incriminating documents used on i
tht. first trial, the dramatic suicide of Colonel Henry,
the attempt to assassinate Labori and the violent effu
sion of the hatreds of race and religion, have com
bir-ed to intensify the feeling of the world for the
prisoner and against his judges.
Some things, however, must not be forgotten. The
Government of Loubet has not been unfriendly to i
Dreyfus. France has been so long in pursuit of glory
on the military road that the army is singularly
seated in the fancy of the people. In the cafes and
the crowds on the boulevards the name of Bonaparte
conjures more powerfully than any other, because it
is identified with military glory transcending that of
Alexander or Caesar. France would to-morrow rush
to the standard of his peer as a commander and a
conqueror, eyes shut to the consequences in the form
af her civil government.
Therefore. Loubet must move in the shadow of this
sentiment in France. The worldwide impulse, which
we have attempted to describe, must be made mind
ful of its own cause and of its own wish. Its motive
i> to benefit in some way the solitary prisoner of
Devils Island. Let those whom that impulse domi
nates consider wisely their purpose. It should be to
nake easy of execution every friendly and humane in
tention of the President of France. Passionate de
nunciation, and above all the proposition to boycott
the Paris Exposition of 1900, only make it harder to
do justice to Dreyfus. It is highly probable that
should Loubet attempt it to the limit of his authority
a revolution would result which would involve Drey
fus and his friends and republican institutions in a
:ommon carnage. Such a result in France would not
urther the ends of justice nor in any way benefit man
viml. We know by certain experiences in this coun
try that a suspicion of foreign interference in our
liTairs is far more likely to confirm even our steady
going people in the wrong than to turn them to the
right. This is much more the case with the French
jeople. The court at Rennes did for France what no
nation can afford to have done for it. It forfeited the
respect of the world. But the world must not inflict
further injury by exhibiting the same order of un
thinking passion which it has hastened to condemn.
Rather should the attitude of the nations now,
toward France, be expressive of confidence in her
national conscience and in her capacity to do justice
to the weakest and most forlorn, and to bravely cor
rect mistakes and right wrongs.
In fine, the world owes to France a duty which
erithet and invective do not express. The nations
should go to Paris in 1900 in the spirit of good neigh
bors to one needful of instruction by example, that
her people may see that the wreaking of race hatreds
and religious animosities is not the path to a high
place in history or the respect of the generations to
come. Especially does this republic owe this form
of duty to her younger sister in the family of the free.
Delegates to the Democratic municipal convention

THE STATE FAIR.
rROM the patronage thus far given to the State
Fair the conclusion may be drawn that the re
sults on the whole will amply repay the directors
for their work in making it generally attractive and
will encourage them and their successors to further
efforts in the future.
The gate receipts show a handsome increase over
those of the previous year. According to the reports
the receipts for the first week at the park amounted
to $5184 25, as against $3227 50 for 1898. The receipts
at the pavilion for the first week of the present fair
were $5672 75, as against $181.3 85 in 1898. The entire
receipts at the park for the two weeks in 1898
amounted to $9187 and the pavilion to $5408 85.
Much of the increased attendance is of course due
tc the general improvement in the conditions of the
people. We are having a season of abundant pros
perity, and all classes of workers have been more or
less benefited by it. They are better able to take a
holiday and make a trip to the fair than for some
years past. Nevertheless, the fact remains that if the
directors had not provided superior attractions at the
fair the holidays would have been spent at other
places. Justice therefore demands that due credit for
the large increase in the receipts be given to those
who have done so much to awaken popular interest
in the fair and to make it a comprehensive exposition
of the industries of the State.
The indirect benefits flowing from the fair are cer

tain to be many and important. Almost every obser
vant man who visits it will find some exhibit in his
line of industry which will stimulate him to stronger
efforts and at the same time inform him of better
methods of management and operation. In every
respect, therefore, the success of the fair is gratifying,
and it is to be hoped the patronage will continue to
increase in extent and liberality.
General Otis has been playing the game of war with
Aguinaldo for a long time without any decisive re
sult. Now that the American has decided to appoint
"Fighting Joe" Wheeler to an important cavalry com
mand it is probable that he will soon have a horse on

The exact dimensions of the Shamrock have at last

ONCE more the question in dispute between the
people and the tax-shirking express company
over the meaning of the war revenue law has
been heard in the courts, once more a decision has
been given in favor of the people, and once more the
corporation has shown its contempt of the court and
its disrespect of law by continuing to practice the old
extortion with all the old-time bravado.
The case just heard and decided by Judge Troutt
is notable because the express company presented a
new argument in defense of its extortion. The cor
poration lawyers contended that as the law did not
specifically state whether the company or the
consignor should bear the burden of the revenue law
as relates to the affixing of stamps to bills of lading or
other manifests, the matter should be left to the par
ties in interest, and the matter of affixing the stamp,
and its attendant expense, left to agreement reached
by argument or barter between the shipper and the
carrier.
Had that contention been sustained by the court
the tax-shirkers would have attained a complete vic
tory, for, as the express companies by their combi
nations with one another have a monopoly of the ex
press traffic of the country, it would have been easy
for them to compel the shipper to pay the tax. The
shipper, in fact, would have had no alternative. If he
declined to pay the tax, the company would either re
fuse to accept his shipment or would have charged
him so high a price as would have made the shipment
unprofitable.
Fortunately, the contention could not be sustained
in law. In the course of his decision Judge Troutt
said: "By schedule 'A' of the act it is declared that
it shall be the duty of the express company to issue
to the person from whom any goods are accepted for
transportation a bill of lading or other .memorandum
of receipt, and that there shall be duly attached to the
same a stamp of the value of one cent; and that any
failure to issue such memorandum shall subject the
company to a penalty of $50. This court has not
changed its opinion as expressed in writing in the
aforesaid Costley ca?c, but assuming, as defendant
claims, that the aforesaid act of Congress does not
declare whether the express company or the con
signor shall provide the aforesaid stamp, still I am j
satisfied that under sections 2169 and 2173 of our Civi
Code the defendant, as a common carrier, is obliger
to accept and transport goods under the circum
stances as they here appear. As the defendant upor
acceptance of the goods would be obliged under bot!
our statute and the aforesaid act to issue a memoran
dum of receipt, it follows that to avoid the commis
sion of a crime it would be obliged to attach the
stamp to the memorandum, even at its own cost, if th<
consignor refused to pay for it."
In all other cases arising under this clause of the
revenue law the express companies have managed tc
obtain delay by appeals taken to the United States
courts. It is believed that in the present case, how
ever, the appeal will go to the State Supreme Court,
and that further delay will be impossible. Of course
every day of delay is of advantage to the express com
panies, as it enables them to continue that much
longer the practice of tax-shirking and extortion.
There is one feature of the issue that is deserving
public attention. When a question was raised con
cerning the validity of the income tax the great cor
porations of the country were eager to get a prompt
decision so as to be relieved at once from paying the
tax. They got it. The courts made way for the test
case. It went from one to another with the rapidity
of a well -arranged programme through a disciplined
party convention. Within a few months it passed
through all the routine of law, reached the United
States Supreme Court and was promptly decided.
Very different has been the conduct of the United
States courts in dealing with the present issue. No
speed has been made in getting a decision on this
case. On the contrary, there has been delay after de
lay in every United States court, whether the ques
tion came up in California, in New York, in Illinois
or any other State. From this very delay the people
will draw the sure conclusion that the corporations
know they have not a good case. They know the
decision must be against them. They fight for delay,
and the courts grant it.
In the issue as now made up there are two things
for the people to do. First, let them make protest
whenever called upon to pay the stamp tax â let them
bring suits and multiply actions against the tax
shirkers; and, second, let them demand that Con
gress at the coming session revise the law, clear it of
all ambiguities and impose a heavier penalty upon the
shirkers. The extortionate corporations have gone
too far. It is now time to show them that law must
be respected and the decrees of the courts obeyed.
Kentucky authorities are greatly concerned over a
desperate renewal of factional and family feuds in the
State. The officers might not unwisely take the
philosophic view that an elimination of certain ele

it out.

LARGEST CRAB IN THE WORLD.
Eleven-Foot Crab Compared With a Man.
THE largest crab In the world Is now on exhibition at Rutgers College
Museum, New Brunswick, X. J. It Is known as a Japanese spider crab and
measures eleven feet from tip to tip.
The crab was presented to the college by the late Robert H. Pruyn,
who was United States Consul to Japan. Its value was appreciated upon
Its discovery, but not until some time afterward did this peculiar thing begin to
receive any great amount of attention.
A short time ago W. A. Roebling. an alumnus of Rutgers College, offered to
defray the expenses of having the crab mounted. The offer was immediately
accepted and the giant shellfish turned over to the care of Mr. Roebling.
The shell of the crab containing the body measures 12x14 inches. The pinch
ers are armed with teeth that resemble human molars and the Jaws at the ends
of the tremendously long fangs or legs are six Inches long. The ten legs re
semble greatly bamboo fishing poles. They are five feet long and vary from three
to eight inches in circumference.
It is said that there are only five of this species of crab in existence. The
next largest is in Germany. That one is six feet from tip to tip. All of these
five crabs were secured in Japan or vicinity.
The crab is being daily viewed by people from all parts of the country.
FRAUD CHARGED
TO CAPITALIST
MARTIN CARTER
Accused of Withhold-
ing Properties.
Martin Carter, as executor of the will
of his deceased brother, Thomas Carter,
the millionaire carbuilder of Newark, has
been deposed by Judge Troutt and he now
rests under the stigma of being the per
petrator of a fraud against the estate of
the deceased. For the time being at least
he has lost his office as executor of his
dead brother's will, and unless on the 22d
inst. he can bring proof that he is wrong
fully accused letters testamentary held
by him will be revoked and the manage
ment of decedent's estate will pass into
other hands.
Yesterday morning Attorneys Stone &
Stone and Thomas D. Riordan appeared
before Judge Troutt and asked that the
power*; of Martin Carter, as executor of
deeendent's will, be suspended and that
a special administrator be appointed. In
support of the motion an affidavit was
lii>-d by William G. Black, making specific
charges of fraud again9t the executor.
After a brief hearing Judge Troutt
granted the motion, suspended the pow
ers of the executor and appointed 0. C.
Colton special administrator, fixing his
bonds at $25,0w.
In his affidavit Black alleges that on
January 5. IW9, Martin Carter, executor
of the will of the late Thomas Carter, re
turned an inver.torv and appraisement of
what purported to be all the properly be
longing to said estate, wherein the prop
erty of the estate was appraised at $11,
--646 01. This Inventory, he alleges, is not
a true inventory of all of the estate of
the deceased which has come to the
knowledge and in the possession of the
executor.
In the order made by Judge Troutt sus
pending the executor he says:
It appearing from the affidavit of William
G. Black that the Inventory and appraisement
was not a true inventory of all the property
that has come into the hands of the executor
and it appearing therefrom that Martin Carter
has concealed properties belonging to the
estate of the deceased.
And It further appearing therefrom that Bald
Martin Carter has in his possession and knowl
edge bonds, contracts and writings which con
tain certain evidences of and tend to disclose
the right, title and interest ami claim of ue
cedent to certain property which Martin Carter
failed and neglected to Include in the Inven
tory riled herein:
And it appearing that decedent and Martin
Carter were at the time of his death partners,
doing business under the name of Carter Bros.,
and that said Inventory contains no mention
of decedent's interest in said partnership:
And It appearing from said affidavit tha,t
decedent just prior to his death was seized
an.l possessed of valuable real estate in the
oountlea of Alameda, Santa Clara. Kern and
th.- city ami county of San Francisco, and that
Mil i Martin Carter is claiming title thereto,
adversely to said estate under <Wds from said
decedent dated a few days prior to his death,
which said d.^ds were not delivered t" said
Martin Carter, and which said renl estate was
n"t delivered to Bald Martin Carter Included
in said Inventory, n<>r was any part thereof.
Now, therefore, by reason of the ab?ve
charges, the court having reason to believe
that said Martin Carter has eommlttpfl a fraud
upon deopiient's estate and has n^pleoted to
perform his duty as executor in failing to re
turn in the Inventory property known by him
to belong to the estate of the deceased,
It is hereby ordered that the powers of said
Martin Carter as executor of thÂ« will of the
late Thomas Carter are hereby suspended until
the further investigation by this court and
until the further order of this court.
It is further ordered that notice of such
suspension be given to said Martin Carter by
service upon him of a copy of this order and
that he bo cited to appear before this court
on the 22d day of f-eptcmher. ISffl. at the hour
nf 10 o'clock a. m.. then and there to appear
and show cause why the letters testamentary
heretofore Issued to him should not be revoked.

A STOCKHOLDER-S. S.. Wrights, Cat
This department has not been able to find
any California case which affects the
right of a stockholder in a suspended bank
to Bell all of his property while the affairs
of the bank are in liquidation. As a
stockholder is liable for the debts of the
concern, such a sale would undoubtedly
be looked upon as fraudulent, for the pur
pose of evading liability. Tfce position of
a purchaser under the circumstances
would depend if he was an Innocent pur
chaser or whether he knew of the fraud
practiced by the seller.
THE STAR SPANGLED BANNERâ R.
8., East Oakland, Cal. The "Star
Spangled Banner" was written during the
bombardment of Fort McHenry, near
Baltimore, by the British during the war
of ]Sl2. by Francis Scott Key, a lawyer of
Frederick, Md., who had gone on board
of the British flagship to solicit the re
lease of a friend, who had been carried
on board a prisoner. The British, as they
were on the point of attacking Fort Mc-
Henry, detained Key, and he as well an
his friend and another American were
transferred to another vessel lying near.
They watched the tight and it wan during
the bombardment that Key was inspired
and wrote the words of the hymn.
BOERS AND ENGLISHâ S. 8., City.
The trouble between the Poers and the
English is of long standing. Twice the
Boers moved on account of British en
croachments. First the Orange Free
State was founded to avoid the British
and the Transvaal republic. Since the dis
covery of gold in the Transvaal there has
been an Influx of English-speaking and
thinking miners, which reduces the Boers
to a minority, but these outsiders or Ult
landers, as they are called, cannot vote
nor can they become citizens until after
fourteen years' residence. The British
want to obtain the right to vote in the
Transvaal without giving up their British
citizenship, and it is chiefly over the sub
ject of double citizenship which the Brit
ish desire that there is trouble in the
Transvaal.
GOLDEN SHOWER
DESCENDS UPON
LUCKY WORKERS
Ship Carpenters Pile
Up Eagles.
Ship carpenters and joiners in this city
are having a season of high-earning ca
pacity that is reminiscent of the golden
days of '49. Those who are in a position
to know say that there are no ship car
penters out of work in the city to-day.
Not only is that the fact, but it is also
true that there is a demand for more.
But this will not draw in workmen from
the outside for the reason that the ex
traordinary demand, which has created
the present unprecedented condition, un
precedented at least in recent years, is
only temporary. The large fleet of Uni
ted States transports to be fitted out has
made the situation.
There are eighteen transports, on all of
which more or less carpenter work and
joining must be done in haste, for the
reason that the entire fleet must sail
within a period of eighteen days. The
fleet is composed of the following named
vessels: Belgian King, Aztec, Relief,
Grant, Centennial, Tacoma, George W.
Elder. Sikh. Sherman, City of Rio Janeiro.
Sherician, Glenogle. Valencia, Charles
Xflson, Zealandia, Hancock, L,ennon and
Victoria. Ten of these vessels must be
fitted entirely for transports and on the
others there is more or less work to do.
When a vessel is taken on as a trans
port she has to be refitted, and this was
thÂ»> condition of ten of the foregoing list
that have been chartered for the Philip
pine transportation service. There are
between 300 and 400 carpenters and join
ers at work on the transports. Probably
there are none who are not working over
time. The reason is plain. For every
hour of overtime the worker gets $1. The
regular price for a day's work of eight
hours is $4. The carpenter who' works
sixteen hours a day gets $12. No one is
discouraged in making time. The longer
he will work the better he suits all con
cerned, for the greatest speed Is needed
to push the work to completion. As a
consequence there are many carpenters
who are earning from $r>o to $60 per week.
Some experts have earned as high as
$100. Contractor Whalen says that he has
paid expert carpenters recently as high
as $100 per week. This sort of news has
spread among the joiners of the city.
Builders complain that many of their
best men have been taken away from
them to work on the United States trans
ports, ar.d they will have to wait to
complete some of their jobs until the
rush is over. In the golden days of Cali
fornia it was not unusual for a skilled
man with tools to make $100 per week,
but that has probably not been the case
at any other period in the history of the
State.
"I have taken on all the ship carpenters
and joiners that I could get, said Con
tractor Whalen yesterday afternoon.
"All the ship carpenters in the city
who arc not working on the
transports are employed upon the regular
steamship lines' vessels."
One result of this activity upon the
transports is evident upon Bast street,
which is now about the busiest thorough
fare in the city with the exception of
Market street. The carpenters are look
ing forward to a continued season of
trosperity, as there are repairs to be
made on all the transports wnen they re
turn fiom the Philippines.

Chief Clerk Ed Williams of the Jus

(loclcion of the Supreme Court cutting

"Tho cutting down of fees." said Mr.
Williams yesterday, "does not lessen the

nro not paid out of the feeÃ collected, but
from the appropriation by the Super
visors. Tho feef that have been cut off
by tho decision nro thoso for writs of at

"We have in the past interpreted the

diminished."

CONLON DENY CHARGES
Accused Members Appeal to
the School Board.
The Tooth Carpenter Was Calm, While His
Colleague Wanted Blood-Grand
Jury to Investigate,
SCHOOL DIRECTOR GEDGE says
he didn't, didn't, didn't. There,
now! In open meeting of the Board
of Education last night he arose to
_ a question of personal privilege, and
â with his voice toned 'to the "softness of
the passage of a new-laid egg through
t l>oillns water said he never, never, never,
in all his official life, received $2000 for as
sisting in the award of school contracts
â to certain named arms.
One of the main points he mad,* in sup
-port of this denial was the fact that he
had lived in this community for more
than twenty-four years. This, it was
suggested, could also be taken as proof
that the doctor is no spring chicken. He
â said he wished to present "other facts,"
-which developed into letters from Payer.
I'pharn & Co. and A. C. Smith, agent for
Ginn & Co.. in which were the statements
that these firms had not paid to Gedge or
Â«.ny other member of the board money for
school contracts.
Director Conlon. who has carefully re
frained from opening his head since the
â¢statement was made that he had received
$SOO of the money said to have passed to
-Influence the contract for school supplies,
followed Gedge on the floor. He had not
"iortined himself with a typewritten ad
dress, and as a consequence floundered
somewhat in his speech. It was short and
bloodthirsty. He denied the allegation
B.nd defied the alienator, apostrophizing as
â¢he went the good old days when life was
cheap and newspaper? were not such
thorns in the flesh of careless public serv
ants.
It was nearly 9 o'clock before the board
â was caiied to order by President Bergerot.
iAII the members but Director Head were
present, and considerable "connubiation"
was going on in the various anterooms.
Gedge and Conlon held several earnest
confabs with themselves and other mem
bers, Kemp communing with his inner
consciousness, utterly indifferent, appar
ently, that there was somethin' . In".
It took ten minutes fnr the reading of
the minutes, at the conclusion of which
proceeding Gedge secured the eye of Pres
:.i.-nt Bergerot.
"I arise to a question of privilege." he
said. "I have been assailed in the press
In regard to my conduct as a city official,
and I have prepared a very brief state
m-.-nt which I would like to read to you."
ihe chair having recognized the right of
the speaker to the floor, Gedge read as
follows:
SAN FRANCISCO. Sept. 13, 1899.

secretary, which I would like ala to hayÂ« i
filed. All I ask In this matter Is that the
board Investigate the charges. This I !
have also asked of the Grand Jury. Re
â¢pa trolly submitted. H. E. GEDGE.
In company with this statement Gedge '
read and submitted the letters from
Payot, Upham & Co. and S. C. Smith,
for â  on & Co., denying charge? of the
payment of money, and offering assistance
to refute the reports. He also read a let
ter from Mr. Simpson, secretary of the .
board, to the effect that the specifications
were not changed. The statement and let- ;
ters were filed, and Gedge sat down. All
?yes were turned on Conlon. He arose to
his feet.
"In regard to the newspaper notoriety !
that has been given to me lately," he !
said. "I would like to state that the as
sertions are false, and can be proven
false: and I wish to say further that Dr. i
Gedge and myself have acted in the way
we thought was for the best interest of j
the School Department. As chairman of l
the supplies committee I will ask this
board to investigate each and every con
tract that has been awarded and sift it to
the bottom.
'â¢I am sorry," he continued, somewhat
at a loss for breath from excitement, ]
"that things are not as they were in the
early days, when .i man who made an as
sertion had to back it up with his life, i
I don't care what man m.*le it; he's a
coward, and he dare not come before the
public and prove it!"
President Bergerot said he did not think :
it within the province of the board to in- ;
vestigate the charges, and thought the
best course to pursue would be to refer j
the matter to a disinterested body, sug- j
gesting the Grand Jury.
Director Armstrong offered the follow- .
ing resolution, in line with the sugges
tion:
Resolved, That the Grand Jury Is hereby
respectfully requested to make a moat 'â â 
thorough Investigation of the cfcaree of i
corruption preferred apalr.st certain mem
bers of the beard by the Morning Call, and j
that the board offer the Grand Jury every '
facility to get at the truth of the whole
matter.
And the incident closed.
TEACHERS MUST FIGHT
School Board Dec ares War on
the Dollar Limit.
The schools will be closed on Friday at
noon in order to permit the teachers to
get together in mass meeting and protest
agair.st the "dollar limit.'" President
Bergerct announced when he opened the
meeting of the Board of Education last
night that the Supervisors would allow
the schools no more in the levy than the
$1,125,000 laid down by Mayor Phelan un
less either the teachers or the Mer
chants' Association advised them to ig
nore the limit.
"I am. sorry to inform you." said Mr.
Bergerot. "that I have been informed by
a person who is very close to the Super
visors that contrary to our expectations
the Supervisors are going to allow us no
more than $1,123,000, the amount fixed by
Mayor Phelan. They say they cannot
Sive us more unless they break the dollar
limit, and that they will not do unless
asked by the Merchants* Association or
by the teachers in mass meeting assem
bled. I would suggest that the schools
close on Friday afternoon so that the
teachers may meet.
â 'It will be evident to them that it Is
better to take this course than that we
be compelled to adopt some other," add
ed Mr. Berg-erot. significantly, and upon
motion of Director Stow the suggestion
was placed formally before the board and
adopted.
The consolidation of evening school
classes, which has for some time past
been discussed as one feasible method of
retrenchment, was begun by Superintend
ent Webster, who offered the following
resolution:
Resolved, That the following appointments
made by the superintendent o" Schools, ren
dered necessary by tbe consolidation and re
c'.as?iScatlon in the -evening schools, be con

Brock and Mrs. M. Watson <date of appoint
ment January 12, lSSn>. from the evening sub
stitu'- list to the evening unaasigned l.at, with
out ray.
The board in executive session adopted
a resolution that the transfer of pupils
from one school to another be suspended
pending the fixing of district lines. A
second paragraph provided that no
teacher shall teach in any school the
principal of which is related to the
teacher by blood or marriage within the
third degree. A third section increases
the pay of substitutes in the day service
to $1 per day when reporting to the sec
retary's office, and $2 50 per day addi
tional for services performed when enÂ«
I In actual work as teacher. All
three sections of the resolution will take
effect October 1.
The secondary education committee
recommended the abolition of the position
of head of department in all public
schools. Director Stow said In support of
the resolution that the position was
purely honorary although the salary is
$15 per month higher. Brandensteln op
posed the measure, but when it came to a
vote it carried.
Tracy R. Kelly of the University of Cali
fornia was appointed teacher of Latin In
the Lowell High School during the ab
sence of W. E. Blanchard, the present in
structor, who was granted a. year's leave
of absence.

THE SAN FB AN CISCO CALL, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 14. 1599.
FASTING AND PRAYER MARK YOM
KIPPUR`S SOLEMN ATORNMENT
VOM KIPPUR. the Jewish day of
atonement, began last night at sun
j down and will continue for twenty
-*â  four hours. At 6 o'clock to-night the
blast of the shofars in the synagogues
Rill signal the end of the rigid fast which
ill Jews are commanded to observe dur
ng this period of- expiation and humility.
Then will the houses of worship be de
serted and the hungry mortals, who have
seen, doing penance before God for their
â ins. will repair to their homes and feast
xrith a clear conscience and a health; ap
petite.
Yon: Kippur is the only fast day or
iained by Moses and. although additional
fast days have been added from time to
Lime by the modern Jews, they have not
succeeded in displacing Yom Kippur from
ts pre-eminent position. It has been ob
served yearly for more than five thousand
ears by the Jews Pharisees and Karites
alike, with a steadfast faith th it neither
persecution nor prosperity has had the
power to break. It is the one day in the
rear when all Jews may have their sins
forgiven if they are truly repentant, and
'x is the day when a!! Jews are expected
to extend the forgiving hand to their
snemies. It is, as the name implies, the
lay when man prostrates himself before
Sod in an attitude of supplication, con
fessing his shortcomings and praying for
forgivenessâ a forgiveness that will be
forthcoming If the applicant is sincerely
penitent.
In preparation for the fast, the Jews of
->an Francisco yesterday entertained and
feasted one another. Just before sun
down they sat down to a substantial
meal, which is to last them until after the
guardians of the education of the children
of the people. Evil Influences, not greater
than have been known to swerve the ac
- of other bodies, but more contempti
ble in that they are p^tty, have long t-x
--their powÂ»r over the greedy who
occupied the chairs in the Board of

IMPRESSIVE SERVICES IN THE JEVMSH SYNAGOGUES.
final blast of the shofar to-night. No
food or drink must pass their lips during
the intervening twenty-four hours, while
business and labor of every description
are forbidden. ; '.â â ;'
The services in tne synagogues began
at 6 o'clock last night, consisting of ad
dresses by the officiating Rabbis and
special musical programmes. In the Fra
ternity Hall of B'nai B'rith building ser
vices were conducted by Rabbi H. J.
Abraham of the Sepharim congregation,
composed of orthodox Jews from coun
tries of the Orient, who came to San
Francisco during the Midwinter Fair and
concluded to make their homes in Cali
fornia. The ritual, while not differing
materially from that used by the Rabbis
of the strictly local, or American, con
gregations, still had a touch of the far
Kast that lent to it a peculiar charm.
In the strictly - orthodox Jewish syna
gogues located south of Market si reet the
elden ritual was also closely adhered to.
Rabbi Voorsanger officiated at the
Temple Emar.u-El and a special musical
programme prepared by Cantor E. J.
Stark and Organist 'â¢V. I. Sabin was ren
dered with pleasing effect. At Sherith
Israel on Taylor street Rabbi Nieto de
livered an address on "Is the Goal in
Sight?" and music was rendered by an
augmented choir and an orchestra of
stringed instruments. Rabbi Meyers offi
ciated at Bush-street Temple and Rabbi
Levy r â¢ Beth Israel. At the latter place
a special musical programme was pre
pared and rendered under the direction
of Cantor Joseph Rabtnowitz and Organ
ist H. J. Stewart.
Services in the synagogues will b? re
sumed this morning at 10 o'clock and will
continue until sundown. The morning ser
vices will consist principally of sermons
by the Rabbis and in the afternoon me
morial exercises for the repose of the
dead will be held. At intervals during
the day the shofar will be sound and as
the sun disappears again beneath the
horizon the most rigid and most strictly
observed fast in the Jewish calendar and
the one that practically marks the close
was turned and their names drawn. The
Jury drawn. Judge Daingerlield appointed
John Bennett foreman. Mr. Bennett was
given the oath. Judge Daingerfieid out
lined the sections of the Code which are
to govern their future investigations and
actions and then the charge upon matters
demanding immediate attention was
given. With the brief charge above given
the court disposed of the School Board
scandal. The attention of the Jury was
then called to the fact that in next No
vember a public election was to be held.
Judge Dair.gerfield informed the body that
crimes against the ballot-box would
doubtless be attempted, and he charged
the members to be prepared to Indict that
all such criminals might be punished for
their offenses.
The Grand Jury then retired to its
rooms and the work of organization was
taken up. "W. S. Gage was appointed sec
retary, after which the matter of selecting
an official stenographer occupied the jury.
Owing to the efficient manner in which
she has conducted the work In the past
and her superior knowledge of Grand Jury
matters. Miss Clara Stockton, who has
occupied the position of official stenog
rapher for some time past, was unani
mously appointed.
The jury then adjourned, but to-day it
will meet and in obedience to the charge
given by Judge Daingerfleld will com
mence the investigation into the charges
of bribery that have centered upon Dr.
H. E. Gedge of the Board of Education.

of the Jewish new year's observances will
** have ended.
â¦ The Geary Street Synagogue was crowd
-1 ed last evening. The Jewish soldiers in
the city, of whom there are a iarge num
â¦ ber. were present, and Rev. M. S. Levy.
<*> the rabbi. In his address spoke of them
and extended them a welcome. He aJso
â¦ announced that the young ladies of the
S congregation would entertain the soldiers
this evening and said that he was proud
of them for doing so. In the beginning of
his address Rev. Dr. Levy explained the
â¦ significance of the Day of Atonement and
i inculcated the lessons to be derived.
Men. he said, might be forgiven for sins
â¦ against God by reason of the Day of
4 Atonement, but to be forgiven for their
sins against men they must atone by their
actsâ by a long series of acts. After en
forcing the lessons he would teach, the
speaker took up the subject of the patri
otism of the Jews. All nations acknowl
edged the great influence the Jews have
had upon civilization and their great work
for morality and religion. But when the
patriotism of the Jew was mentioned
many shrugged their shoulders. The Jew
should assert himself. He had been mis
understood long enough. His patriotism
was of the highest order. The tablets of
Egypt. Assyria. Phoenicia. Babylon, Rome
and Greece told of his patriotism; of his
heroic struggles to preserve national exis
tence. No other people had given such
proofs of patriotism as the Jews. In the
terrors of the Coliseum, at thousands of
pyre?, the Jew had asserted his religion
and his nationality.
Then Dr. Levy "spoke of the Jewish
patriots of the present time. A few days
ago a regiment from New York arrived
in the city and a large percentage of the
members of that regiment were Jews.
They had expressed regret to him that
they had been unable to celebrate .he
New Year. They had wished to be in the
synagogue to observe Yam Kippur. and
they were present. They would go abroad
and would bear arms side by side with
those of other faiths. The loyalty that
they had for their religion indicated the
patriotism that they would display for
their native land and its flag. "While there
have been many courts-martial since the
war began, he was pleaseu to say that
not one had been held on account of a
Jew.
Dr. Levy personally addressed the sol
diers present. <;<><! only knew what would
befall them within the next year. They
were away from home and parents and
were going to a land far away. God be
with them. Dr. Levy made his remarks
to the soldiers with a show of deep
feeling.
The music during the services was of
a high order. Professor H. J. Stewart was
at the organ. The cantor was J. Rabino
witz. The choir consisted of eight singers.
ATTACKED THE MATE.
Disgruntled Sailor Makes a Commo-
tion on Board the Dauntless.
Charles Jacobin, a saii^r on the Daunt
less, was arrested by Officers Maekey and
Callahaji yesterday evening on the com
plaint of F. H. Cruthers. pilot of the
vessel, and charged with assault with a
deadly weapon at the Harbor police sta
tion. It is alleged that Jacobson. who
has been on the Dauntless for several
weeks, wanted to draw his wages yester
day, and that upon being refused he drew
a screwdriver, the blade of which had
been sharpened, and made a savage at
tack upon the mate of the ship. The
blade cut a large gash in the mate's side.

EASTERN MARKETS.
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Sept. 13.â recuperation of
the money market by means of the severe
liquidation of the last two days was reflected
In a much Improved tone in the stock market.
Prices were little inclined to advance in the
early dealings. In spite of the buoyant tones
In the London market and the vigorous
strength shown by a few specialties. Early
loans on call were maile at "<&VA per cent
and a decline set in soon after the opening, j
which carried the level generally below that
of last night. The rate in call loans then fell i
to 3 per cent, and after stiffening again spas- j
modically eased off In the latter part of the j
day to 2 per cent. About midday there came j
the announcement that the Treasury Depart- j
ment had decided to anticipate by about ten
days the October payment of interest on Gov
ernment bonds, which will amount in the ag
gregate to over $5,000,000. The shorts took ,
alarm at the steady advance which set in and i
rushed to cover, bidding up prices In the clos- !
ing dealings by wide advances to the top level
of the day. The closing was very active and
buoyant and shows net gains ranging from
one to six points. To-day was the fortnightly
settlement on the London Stock Exchange,
where quite a large short interest Is said to
have existed in Americans. The decline here I
therefore was very opportune and London
bought to the extent of about 25,000 shares. :
Tennessee was strong from the outset, ami
after moving- in an erratic way closed the day '
with an advance of 8% points. American :
Tobacco also developed early strength and left
off over 3 points higher. Brooklyn Transit
wag down nearly to yesterday's lowest point
and shows a fractional net gain. The new United
State* Milling stocks moved up all day and
show net gains of over I points each, and Colo- j
radn Fuel as much. There â â .... active upward j
movements In the Leather stocks. The demand :
for the railroads generally gained in volume
as the day advanced and the upward move- i
ment was quite uniform In the principal ac- !
tive Issues, which have net gains of between
1 and 2 points In many instances.
The movement of money on balance con
tinued in favor of the Interior to-day, but a
debit balance at the clearing house by the
Sub-Treasury relieved the pressure somewhat.
So far as Is known there was no fresh sup
ply of money In the market, though the sharp
break in the call loan rates suggested that
some hidden reserve might have been brought
forward. Sterling exchange fell an additional
fraction for actual rate? and posted rat. - were
reduced % cent, but the fact that discounts
In London were easier indicated that no gold
movement is In prospect from that quarter.
Bonds were inclined to cover In sympathy
with stocks, the speculative Issues leading.
Total sales, par value, $2,473,000.
United States bonds were unchanged in bid
quotations.

Chicago Grain Market.
Â« *
! CHICAGO, Sept. 13.â Wheat opened very dull
j and weak, September at %c decline and De
| cember %c below yesterday's close. The bull
! ishness caused by the Government report had
I entirely disappeared. Foreign markets were
j weak and lower and local and Northwest re
j ceipts were heavy. The market, with those
conditions prevailing, was apparently in a ses
sion of dullness and further decline. But
shortly after the opening some sharp bidding
for September brought to light a condition of
! affairs in that option that indicated a war
1 among prominent elevator Interests for cash
: wheat, with the Weares and Peavey on one
side and Armour on the other. In August,
when September was 2%Â®2%C under December,
Weare and Peavey are said to have changed
a large line, selling December and buying Sep
tember. Armour held the bulk of the cash
wheat and Is said to have sold In the expecta
tion of getting a larger carrying charge later.
Instead, however, the difference has steadily
narrowed, and efforts to-day on the part of
shorts to cover a rather small line were unsuc
cessful. Then prices began to Jump. The mar
ket suddenly became very active, with big and
little shorts bidding for September wheat but
securing little until the price had Jumped from
the opening figure of 70% cto 72'i(g72%c. At
that price elevator people holding the wheat
let go in sufficient quantities to relieve the
pressure, but the evident unwillingness of
longs to sell except at enhanced values made
the shorts decidedly nervous and kept the mar
ket stirred up during the entire session. The
strength of September put shorts in the more
deferred futures on the anxious seat also, and
business in December and May was active all
day, with a steady advance in values. Sep
tember reacted to 71 7 and closed at that price.
December opened at 70%<g70%c and advanced to
71% C, where It closed.
Corn was strong, though not especially active.
The strength of wheat was a factor early, and
later the good cash demand and some pros
pects of frost to-night stiffened the market still
more. September was especially strong. De
cember closed %<fi '4c higher and September
'â /a r up.
Heavy selling by longs caused a Blight de
cline in oats. The market early was firm, but
liquidation, which â¢ became general, made a
heavy market later. December closed a shade
lower.
Provisions were weak early on a fairly liberal
run of hogs, but rallied later on the strength
of wheat and on the excellent cash demand.
There was a cessation of the recent selling and
the general demand Improved. At the close
October pork was 5c higher, lard 10c higher
and ribs 2%Â«?5c higher.

Boston Wool Market.
BOSTON, Sent. 13â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow: The wool
market is very active and strong. Several of
the largest mills have been represented in the
market during the past week and they have
contracted for hutre blocks of wool, covering
a number of varieties and grades. Large lines
of Territories have b<?en taken in million
round lots and over, one house reporting a
sale nf 2.000,000 pounds and a sale of 1.500.000,
while several others report large transactions,
aggregating in each case a half million pounds
or more. Fleeces have been in large movement
and the demand for pulled wools also has im
proved. A decidedly better demand for me
dium wools is noted. In addition to the busi
ness reported as having been consummated,
there has been an almost unprecedented inquiry
for sample bags, which it is believed will result
in further large transactions in the course of a
week or two. Prices continue strong, with an
upward tendency. The sales of the week in
Boston amounted to 8.4G1.6C0 pounds domestic
and 4.55.000 foreign, making a total of 8,056.600,
against a total of 6,648,500 for the previous
week and a total of 2,376,000 for the correspond
ing week last year.
Sales since January 1. I SS9 . amount to 200,
--334.100 pounds, against 52,180,010 pounds last
year at this time.

Hay and Feedstuff s.
Bran and Middlings continue firm at un
changed prices.
Receipts of Hay suddenly fell off, but the
I market showed no Improvement. The circular
;of Somers & Co. says: "Matters continue
along in a peculiarly uninteresting condition,
' especially as much of the Hay now arriving is
; of a medium grade rather than what might
; be termed good or choice, as has been noted
quite freely on the market during the months
of July and August. In a few districts, where
pressing was commenced early, the fields are
about cleaned, although In many other places
they are not more than half through with
threshing and baling. Warehouses are filling
rapidly all over the country, although In many
places it will be well into October before all
the available space Is filled. There has been
! some little Inquiry on the market during the
| past week for Hay for shipment south, but the
I small difference in the range of prices between
the Los Angeles market and the San Francisco
i market does not allow any shipments there for
the present, at least. The general inquiry is
for Barley Hay, which is not very plentiful
and which sells very slowly on the San Fran
cisco market. We think that during the winter
rome Hay will be shipped south from this mar
ket, but the demands for the Los Angeles and
San Diego markets will hardly be enough to
make any appreciable effect on our market or
prices here."

END OF FIGHT
OVER BURIAL OF
LITTLE ALMA
County Will Not Be
Asked to Pay.
Oakland Office Pan Francisco Call,
Broadway, Sept. 13.
There will be no bill filed with the coun
ty for the expenses of the funeral of little
Alma Christiansen. At the last meeting
of the Supervisors a very interesting let
i'i from a firm of Berkeley un
dertakera complaining that Coroner Mehr
m.inn had taken the funeral out of their
â  by offering the bereaved but Indig
nant parents the attraction of a couple
of hacks, in addition to a free grave and
tasket.
The Berkeley undertakers complained
that the order that was given them by
â ip^r Mitchell to provide a county
burial was ignored and overridden by the
Coroner. Tht- complaint was read to the
board and tiled with the county expert
for the purpose of being held till the Cor
-uould file a bill charging the county
with what lie had promised to provide
free.
The bill had been paid. It was paid by
â ri.ia. and Nevada Railroad Com
and the little incident which threat
ened to have much political significance
will never be heard of officially. Coroner
Mehrmann will of course charge his fee
:' Â»r the official part of the work, but the
y will hear nothing of the cost of
the funeral.
The burial of the five-year-old girl, In
cluding the two hacks about which so
much was said, cost just $47, and Albert
Brown, the undertaker, provided all the
necessary material by order of the rail
road company.
Alma Christiansen was playing in a
it lot when Home sparks from an
16 of the company set fire to the dry
grass. She was burned to death, and al
though the coi: ; idiatea any sug
n that it might be responsible, by
contributory negligence or anything else,
for the chilli's death, it decided as a mat
ter of de< â¢ ' 'hristianson6 being
very poor, that it would provide the fu
neral
The trouble apparently occurred because
. puty Coroner, Henry Quellin, is also
mploye of l*nd>Ttaker Brown, and
when he took â¢â harge of the little girl's
burial he was acting in accordance with
the railroad company's orders and with
the consent of the little victim's parents.

of th<* well-known grocers in

something 1 In the dessert line â dried
fruit, prunes, raisins or the like, and
when I put it in the store a giance at
the label persuaded me to make a trial
personally.
"I had at the store for my supper a
dish and a half dish, and was im-
pressed, perhaps unfavorably, with its
richness, perceiving at the same time
l;..\v very appropriately the new food
was named. Strange as it may appear,
its effect was almost at once apparent.
Seated that evening at my home I re-
marked to the family that it was the
tlrst time in a whole year that I had
felt like myself. I was much elated and
naturally attributed the change to

. for the reason. The man or
woman worn out with overwork or
>UB prostration will .md an im-
mediate gain in strength by the use of
Grape-Nuts and cream, because of the
fact that the natural phosphate of
h obtained from certain parts of
the prams Is one of the strong ele-
ments In Grape-NtttÂ«, and this is pre-
sented to the system In the form de-
manded by nature; not as a drug.
The system takes up the needed
particles of phosphate of potash and it
is now known that the soft gray mat-
te: which fills the delicate nerve cen-
Throughout the body as well as
rain and the solar plexus, can
only be made and renewed from day to
<!ay by the action of phosphate of
potash on albumen. Albumen is one
principal elements of all food.
Jut unless albumen has with It in the
i a sufficient amount of phos-
nf potafh it cannot be trans-
.l Into brain matter without the
action of this particular element, for
there is no known way to make gray
. ; except by the combination of
men and phosphate of potash.
Therefore, when one uses Grapp-
NutH he makes use of the best scien-
knowledge of the day in the selec-
tion of food for Invigorating and j
revitalising the body. This food has
me famous throughout the world,
it is to be found in every flrst-
class grocery store. Grape-Nuts are I
made by the Postum Co. at their fac-
tories in Eattle Creek- J
HAUNTED TO DEATH BY
PHANTOM "HELLO" BELLS
Nettie Friebel, a Telephone Girl,
Succumbs to Brain Fever.
Raving of Imaginary Messages, She Dies
Under the Eyes of Her Distracted
Mother- -Switchboard's Work.
NETTIE FRIEBEL, A VICTIM OF THE TELEPHONE SERVICE.
OAKLAND, Sept. 13.â Nettie Friebo!,
but 15 years old, lies dead at her
home to-night, a victim to the re
markable effect exercised on her
brain and mind by fivÂ« months' work
at a telephone switchboard. For several
days before her death she was engaged In
fierce combat with a phantom receiver
that would convey imaginary messages
to her wrecked mind.
"Five months ago," said Mrs. Friebel
tn-night, as she s-at In their cozy but
humble little h"ine. surrounded by two or
three sympathetic friends, "Nettie begged
to be allowed to help earn something tor
the house, and said that she could get
work at the telephone company. We did
not want her to go there, though, and
only consented after she ha<l begged hard.
For at first, until she was broken in, she
would receive nothing, and after that only
very small wages.
"We let her go. She was so tall and
strong ajid well, every one thought her
much older than she was, and we did not
believe that the work would hurt h*r.
But a few w.-eks ago we saw that it was
making her sick, and soon afterward she
came home, after staying at her desk as
long as possible, and never was out of
bed again.
"She went to work each morning at
half past 7 arid came home at 2 o'clock.
Then she returned at j and was due back
here at 10. but oftener at 11 or half-p;ust.
She had so little sleep, her meals wure bo
Irreguiax and the work was so hard, with
the roar In her ears that, strong as she
was, it killed her."
\fter the delirium began two weeks ago
the child rarely regained consciousness.
Day and night she raved, lx-Kging that
the man who was shouting into her poor
ears be taken away and answering hour
In and hour out countless imaginary tele
phone messages. Her strength ebbed fast
and gave out sooner than her family In

JOHN NICHOLL
FAINTS AND SO
DELAYS TRIAL
Aged Defendant Not
So Very Spry.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. Sept. 13.
The spectators who crowded Judge Og
den's courtroom this morning to listen to
the trial of Jane Hodge's $60,000 breach
of promise damage suit against the aged
capitalist, John Nlcholl. were Badly dis
appointed in their hunger or thirst for a j
sensation.
No sooner had the jury been polled, and
juror O. C. Hyatt reprimanded by the
court for being tardy on account of the j
absence of a clock at his home, than Ma- j
jor J. B. Mhoon, chief counsel for the de- â 
fendant, pprung a surprise by moving for j
a continuance. Major Mhoon declared
that his aged client had been seized with
a fainting spell yesterday after court haÂ«i
adjourned. He went on to recite that Mr. .
Nlcholl had collapsed at the office of Dr.
E. H. Wonlsc-y while the latter was con- I
ducting an examination on the capitalist.
The result of the examination, it is un
derstood, was to have played an important j
part at the Bensatlonal trial.
To support the motion Dr. Eastman of ;
Berkeley was called to testify that he j
had afterward been called to treat Mr. j
Nlcholl. and later Dr. Frank Adams, ;
the family physician, was called in. Dr. i
Adams was also called as a witness, and j
testified that the capitalist was resting
at his home comfortably, but that an
examination showed that the patient's
lower limbs were suffering a dropsical
condition. In the opinion of the doctors
Nlcholl would hardly be in a fit condition
to reappear at the trial before a week.
Attorney Foote. on behalf of the plaint
iff expressed briefly some doubt as to
whether the aged capitalist might not be |
"faking " but Dr. Adams tried to dispel i
this idea. Nevertheless Mr. Foote "thought !
it seemed singular."
Major Mhoon, however, pressed the is- |
sue, declaring It would be impossible to |
oroceed without the presence of his client.
"No prudent attorney would proceed. ;

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 14. 1899.
At the very beginning of her illness a
physician was summoned. The diagnosis
waa brain fever. As she grew worÂ«-? other
physicians were called In for consulta
tion. One of these was Dr. J. J. Dunn,
who declarea then that the ravages of
typhoid had been added to those of the
nuntal malady. ] >r. W. ML Reckwith was
summoned, too. and. like Dr. Dunn, de
tected the presence of the second disease,
nut all that skill and medicine could do
was of no avail
Mr. and Mrs. Friebel declare that their
child ip not the worst sufferer from the
severe demands of the telephone service.
Nettie's chum, a Miss Campbell of East
Oakland, was taken recently to the insane
asylum at Napa, her mania being the
perpetual ringing of the telephone in hr-r
ears and the nevor-eeas ing answering of
calls. The two girls were great friends
while employed by the company, and went
back and forth to and from their work
topether. When Miss Campbell was
stricken Nettle sorrowed deeply. and
spoke again and again of the awful test
> f strength imposed in their employment.
"My child." sobbed Mrs. Friebel last
evening, "gave her life for a mere nothing.
The first month she was paid she brought
me horn* 1 $7. Then she came home with $9.
The most she ever received was $17 75.
They docked her little salary of $20 per
month on every possible excuse. She
told me once that she couldn't complain,
because Miss Campbell had only received
$3 for a whole month's work at the build
ing on Twelfth street. Miss Campbell
told Nettie that she was ashamed to tell
her folks how little she had received."

she took to her bed. Nettie Friebel suffer

The girls when they complained. Nettie
told her bother, were informed that they
"would have to stand it until new parti
tions were put In," the old ones having
been taken down.
The dead girl was a pupil last year at
the Oarfield Grammar School, where she
was considered a bright student and ex
ceedingly strung physically. She waa
known to some of her friends as Agnes,
that being her name and not Nettle,
which was her pet and home name.

the major.
. "Well, do you mean to say that counsel
for plaintiff wishes to execute the defend
ant?" queried the court, and the major re
plied that "they would do It if they
could."
"It may be," interrupted Mr. Foote.
that that was what was the matter with
the defendant yesterday."
Major Mhpon looked daggers as he re
plied: "Well, if you were <6 years old and
were drawn into a scrape like this you
would not like it very well. 1 think"; but
Mr. Foote objected to the irrelevancy of
the confab, though his Honor decided its
pertinence.
"W hen Major Mhoon gets to be 76."
continued* Mr. Foote. "I would like to
hear him speak for himself."
It was, finally decided to grant a contin

SONS CONTEST WILL
OF ANNEY SWEENEY
OAKLAND, Sept. 13.â Edward M. Swee
ney, a San Francisco attorney, and John
J. Sweeney to-day filed a contest and
opposition to the probate of an alleged
will of their mother, Anney Sweeney, filed
a few days ago by B. McFadden. who is
named as executor. . The estate is valued
between $6000 and $10,000, and by the terms
of the alleged will the bulk of the estate,
mostly money on deposit in the Hlbernia
Bank, Is bequeathed to J. J. Sweeney, one
of the sons. To Edward M. Sweeney
originally $1000 was .bequeathed, but a
codicil reduced this â¢to $500, and to the
pastor of Sacred Heart Church $50 was
bequeathed for masses for the repose of
testatrix's soul, $50 toward a new church
building and $25 for the altar society.
In their contest, prepared by George D.
Collins, the two sons allege that their
"mother was of unsound mind and that
the execution of the alleged will was In
duced and procured by the Rev. Lawrence
Serda. pastor of Sacred Heart Church,
actively aided and abetted by B. McFad
den; that the latter drew up said will at
the request of the pastor In whom tes
tatrix, as a member of his church for
years, had implicit confidence." That the
will was not subscribed by decedent nor
by any person in her presence or by her
direction. In short, that the document
was not executed by decedent freely or
voluntarily. - ' 'â  _

LIFE'S SECRET
REVEALED BY
TUCKER'S DEATH
Was Once a Noted St.
Louis Crook.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Sept. 13.
"Earnestly hoping that you will
remain where you are and fight un
der your banners for the good cause,
I am very truly yours,
"WILLIAM DESMOND,
"Chief of Detectives.
"P. S. â Did you know that your old
chums, High Gorham and Jen Mc-
Cann, had a 'difficulty' a few months
ago, resulting in Gorham being shot
dead by McCann, who was arrested?
"W. D."
William Desmond's hope can never be
broken, for Dennis Tucker, to whom the !
St. l>ouis chief of detectives wrote the .
letter from which the above is an ex
tract, has just died at San Jose.
It was always known that Dennis, who ;
for nine years had been a shining light
in General Booth's army, had a very dark
past, but not until the contents of his :
trunk were scrutinized by friends was '
it known that Tucker had served more '
than half his lifetime in jail and was |
really an outcast from Chicago.
One of the letters in Tucker's trunk tells |
the whole story. It is from Chief Dcs- i
mond, and while containing expressions
of encouragement, also teems with sar- \
casm not very adroitly veiled. Desmond
says:
"Dear Dennis Tucker: I received your
letter a few days ago informing me ;
that you are a member of the Salva- ;
tion Army. I am very glad to
hear that you have found a post
tion where you can do an immense j
amount of good by showing the depraved
element (of which you were once a prom- i
inent disciple) what can be done by self
denial and a resolve to do right.
"The criminal element in St. Louis is ;
about the same as it was when you were
here, possibly it is a little improved for
the better since you left, but not much.
"There are quite a number of what you
might facetiously call the gang still work- j
ing at their old tricks in this city, and ,
if a company of them could be shipped ;

would be for all concerned. They would
be leaving here 'for their country's good,'
and under your especial tutelage they
would be worthy followers of the Lord.
Very truly yous.
"WILLIAM DESMOND."
In a letter that Tucker wrote to Chief
Desmond he said: "You remember when
I was in the Dewdrop saloon what a
scoundrel I was? I would rob the pennies
off a dead man's eyes, but the Lord has
forgiven me and now I get out on the
street with the army and tell the life I
have led."

BIGAMIST C. L WOLF
WEPT LIKE A CHILD
OAKLAND, Sept. 13.â Charles L. Wolf
pleaded guilty before Judge Hall to-day
to the charge of bigamy, waived time and
was sentenced to two years' imprisonment
in San Quentin. When sentence was pro
nounced he blubbered like a child. He
explained to the court how he had been
deceived by Rosle L. H. Wolf, who pre
ferred the charge, also by his first wife
back in New Jersey, but Judge Hall re
minded him <>f his wrongdoing. "No doubt
you now realize," said Judge Hall, "what
it is to get married too often."
When seen in the County Jail this after
noon Wolf's tears had dried away and he
expressM himself as fortunate with the
light sentence. He reiterated his defama
tory words about the women he had mar
ried, and exhibited a letter received yes
terday from Mattie Tyrer, with whom he
had eloped to Tesla, where he was ar
rested. In the letter the girl asks for a
lock of his hair and promises to visit him
at San Quentin when he gets there.
Mattie Tyrer has been missing from her
home several days. Her father, W. At
wood. is greatly worried over her where
abouts, but the letter in Wolfs possession
shows that she is in Stockton, whither
she went last Saturday in the company of
a colored man, with whom she became ac
quainted at Tesla.
"I have bepn a victim of conspiracy "
said Wolf this afternoon. "But for my
tender heart I never would have married
my second wife. I meant it all for the
best. My attorney produced a letter
wherein It stated 1 was in a New York
hospital, and he tells me that letter he
got up as a blind to throw the authorities
off my track. Well. I have always been
a law-abiding citizen, but perhaps It
would have been better had I been born
In Utah or Turkey. I go to San Quentin
with a clear conscience, and when I come
out I will prove myself as good a man as
when T went there."

SAID TO HAVE
PAID MONEY TO
"FIX" HER CASE
Ruby Raymond Sur-
renders Herself.
Ruby Raymond, the woman from San
Jose whose bonds of $10,000 were declared
forfeited by Judge Mogan Tuesday be
cause she failed to- make her appearance
In court, surrendered herself to the
police yesterday morning.
She told two or three tales as to why
! she nad not appeared in court. One was
that John Madden, a teamster in the em
' ployment of E. Martin & Co.. wholesale
I liquor men. had got $150 from her Monday
night to "fix" the case so that she would
not have to appear In court. Then she
| told other tales, but Judge Mogan, on
- being informed as to Madden, issued a
bench warrant for his arrest, and he will
', have to appear in court this morning: to
' explain. Attorney Mack, who is defend
' ing the woman in conjunction with Louis
O'Neal of San Jose, says that Madden
; brought her to his office Monday night
\ and she paid him $150 as part of his fee
lof $250. Any talk of "fixing" the case
; bo far as Mack is concerned, he declares
! absurd, as he told the woman that on the
I contrary the case was a very strong one
i against her.
The woman is charged with taking
â  Nathalie Danforth and Daisy MlHer,
two girls under 18 years of ape to her
house In San Jose for immoral purposes
1 without the Consent of their parents or
guardians. The charges were altered
yesterday to come under section 267 of
the Penal Code, and when they were
; called in court the defendant's attorney
; pleaded hard for a continuance, as they
had been unable to subpena their wit
| nesses. The Judge held that although
the section under which the charges were
] made had been changed, the facts wore
the same and he did not think the de
fendant was entitled to a continuance, as
; she had ample time to get her witnesses,
i but he would continue the case after
i hearing the witnesses for the prosecu
-1 tion, so that the defense might get their
1 witness. Maude Burdette then testified
i to having met the defendant in this city
i and arranging with her to send the two
'^â¢irls to San Jose. The case was con-
I tinued till to-morrow.
An application was made to recall the
; order declaring the bonds given for the
defendant's appearance forfeited, but the
Judge would only agree to stop proceed
ings for the recovery of the amounts in
i the bonds till the cases were concluded
in his court. The defendant is In the City
â¢ Prison, as the Judge ordered that she
should be held without ball.
WILL SEEK TO HAVE
INCREASED APPROPRIATIONS
CERTAIN DEPARTMENTS IN
NEED OF MORE MONEY.
The Supervisor Bases His Action on
the Need of Improvements of
All Kinds in the
City.
When the question of the tax levy
comes up for final consideration before
the Board of Supervisors at next Mon
day's meeting Supervisor Holland will
submit several amendments increasing
the appropriations as already decided on
In certain departments. Holland bases
his proposed course on the need of im
provements in this city and believes that
his reasons will be found logical.
The amendments contemplate additional
appropriations for paving streets, the
proper care of Golden Gate Park, the
building of a new City and County Hos
pital and various other propositions
which he deems should have more money
than has been already appropriated under
the pledge of the dollar limit. "I am a
firm advocate," said Holland yesterday in
discussing the subject, "of Improvements
in our city, and my amendments will be
almost entirely based on the idea of put
ting our streets and public parks in the
best of condition. The recent welcome
to the First California Volunteers prob
ably did more to advertise the city than
any other project, and I am of the opin
ion that we are on the eve of a great fu
ture. San Francisco is destined to make
rapid strides from now on. The increase
in the appropriations which I will en
deavor to bring about Is warranted in
every instance.
"For example, I am In favor of afford
ing proper protection to the property of
our citizens, and therefore have added
$50,000 to the sum already set aside for the
Fire Department. I believe in having all
possible safeguards around the public
health, therefore I have added $70,000 to
the Board of Health figures. In view of
danger from Infectious diseases, now that
we have acquired new Oriental posses
sions. I allow $5000 for a smallpox hospi
tal, $50,000 for a new hospital and $10,000
for improving the old one, which are new
items. Regarding the item of $6900 for
the Board of Public Works, I find that
no allowance has been made for it, though
the new charter provides for Its crea
tion No appropriation has been made for
salaries of the Panhandle Commissioners,
and I allow them $8000."
The increases in detail are as follows:
Repnving accepted streets, $105,000; Gold
en Gate Park, $70,000; public schools, $70,
--0- Board of Health, $70,000; City and
County Hospital (new), $50,000; improving
old hospital. $10,000; smallpox hospital,
$:,in)- Fire Department, $50,000; election
expenses $30 000; park Panhandle. $8000;
Board of Public Works, $6900; bond elec
tion, $5000.
A TANGLED CASE
Three Men of the Same Name Figure
in a Story of Bobbery.
A peculiar case came under police ob
servation yesterday, and It is now in such
a tangled condition that the officers do
not know what to make of it. It is one
of alleged robbery, and apparently three
men of the same name figure In Jt.
Yesterday afternoon John La Grange
called at police headquarters and stated
that he had been robbed of considerable
money and valuables by two men repre
senting themselves as police officers.
He stated that he was asleep in a. house
at Sn7 Pacific street and that a short time
after 12 o'clock on Tuesday night both of
the fake officers entered his room. One
of them drew a revolver and forced him
to hand over $14 in coin, a diamond ring
and a silver watch. Detective Wmn ,was
detailed on the case and he located a man
hv the name of John La Grange in the
house at the above address, but this party
disclaims all stories of any robbery. The
detective also ascertained that another
man of the identical name had been found
in a drunken condition on Bacon place at
about 3 o'clock yesterday morning and
locked up in a police station. This latter
La Grange was released as soon as he was
sober The detective is still working on
the case and expects to secure additional
light upon it to-day.
In the Divorce Court.
Margaret Martinetz was granted adi
vorce yesterday by Judge Belcher from
A R. Martinetz on the ground of deser
tion.
Frederick Querren was granted a di
vorce from Nellie Querren on the ground
of desertion.
Suits for divorce were filed yesterday
by Josephine Kean Hughes against T. G.
liuehes for failure to provide; William
P Hfrman against Alwlne Herman, for
desertion; Sarah E. King against George
King for desertion; Hulda Meyer against
Oustave Meyer, for cruelty; Emma M.
Brown against Joseph A. Brown, for fail
ure to provide; Jessie Hopkins against
Charles C. Hopkins, for failure to pro

Peters, for cruelty.
Volunteer Baseball.
The boys of the First Regiment are
taking a great Interest in the baseball
game to be played next Sunday between

Oakland Heesemans.
The volunteers are hard at work every
day. The game is to come off next bun
day at the Presidio athletic grounds.
A MELODIOUS
COMIC OPERA
WELL STAGED
MEMORY started a rumor that "Fati
nitza" Is merry in music and bright
in dialogue. Place no credence in
the latter half of the rumor and
you have the truth. The dialogue is
puerile, formless and full of superflui
ties. Printing the argument on comic
opera programmes is a necessary con
cession to the intelligence, for the best
eye cannot see in the dark. To be sure,
the dramatic form, which I shall ever in
sist should come first in any operatic
work, never lives up to the argument and
hence recalls forcibly the billboards of
a circus, but the argument throws a cer
tain necessary light. And why always
seek the impossible and unreal for comic
opera inspiration? In the words of Locke,
let our librettists occasionally "cross
their own inclinations and follow the
dictates of reason"â write a good comedy
in rhyme and have it set to music whose,
glee has a leaving to the cla-sslc. The
music of "Fatiriitza" is in the true Yon
Suppe spirit. Melodious and tuneful.
Scarcely any one can help yielding to the
current infatuations of his neighbors, and
so I left agreeing with the audience that
William Wolf was a joujr, blushing Kant
chukoff, Arthur Wooley a clever German
dialect artist, Thomas Persse a trim, in
sistent war correspondent, Edith Mason
a sweet voiced Manova, Hattie Belle
Ladd a picturesque lieutenant, the chorus
in its first act disguises quite astonish
ing and Interesting enough to be worthy
the second trip round the stage that the
gallery demanded and the whole opera
well worth the time ppent. There is a
profusion of simple melody for the prin
cipals and most of it exceedingly well
sung, but not as much work for the
chorus as one likes the Grand Opera
house chorus to be given. May that cho
rus never grow less in numbers or value.
That is a good snow scene in the first
act, on the lower Danube. A little
stretching of the mental vision, a little
closing of the eyes to the manner of
snowfall and it is a very good substitute
for a first-hand observation of the re
ality. Comic opera is often more satis
fying, musically, than its more ambitious
sister, for since the demands are lighter
it is likely to be the better sung, just as
a simp'e song that i? perfect of its kind
stands higher than an epic of inferior ex
ecution. There was a good house and
generous applause. Next week "The
Drum Major's Daughter" will be sung.
CHARLOTTE THOMPSON.
Midweek Notes.
"Othello" has proved so successful at
the Tivoll that it will be sung again next
week, alternating with "La Traviata."
"The Wages of Sin" at the Alcazar has
played to the capacity of the theater.
"Too Much Johnson," with some wonder
fully realistic scenery, is the attraction
next week.
The excellent bill at the Orpheum has
crowded the theater nightly. Next week
four new attractions will be added.
It Is probable that the first week of
the Modjppka engagement at the Colum
bia will be devoted to "Marie Antoinette,

WILL COLONIZE
ON SAN CLEMENTE
Party Organized to Take
Up the Land.
Special Dispatch to The Call,
PASADENA, Sept. 13.â San Clemente, &
desert island so called, which lies in the
Pacific In the Santa Barbara Channel
group, is to be colonized, if the plans of
Mr. Bolton and forty odd families of thla
neighborhood he has interested do not
fall through. These families have pooled
their belongings and propose to squat on
160 acres each.
San Clemente is about seventy miles off
the coast from San Pedro, lying between
San Pedro and San Diego. It is a portion
of Los Angeles County, and is about
twenty miles long. Its widest place is six
miles across. For thirty or forty years
sheep have wandered about the island.
Tom Gallagher, who died recently,
watched these sheep for over twenty
years. The sheep lived off the brush. The
winds tore down the trees and the sheep
herders have frequently had to dig into
the wind-blown sand for wood. But in
the sheltered canyons and valleys there
are wild cherries and on the plains to the
north grain of all kinds will grow pro
fusely.
San Clemente is frcstloss. There is water
standing in pools in the canyons. \Yild
goats and quail are there in abundance.
Years ago a sheep herder brought over
three brown goats and left them corralled
while he visited Los Angeles a hundred
miles away. When he returned to the
island the* goats had broken away and
were never caught. They multiplied and
to-day hundreds of them dwell in thÂ©
ca% - es or rock shelters and scurry up the
canyons.
The only inhabitants of San ClementÂ©
are a few sheep and cattle herders and a
hermit. Aleck O'Leary, who lives with his
goats and cat and dog miles from human
beings. Sometimes he comes to the main
land, making the trip in a skiff with a
flour sack for a sail.
The climate of the place is excellent and
the soil good. There is but one obstacle
In the way of settlement by farmers. This
island, together with Santa Barbara and
San Nicholas Island and several of the
Santa Cruz group, was set aside by the
Government for lighthouse and naval pur
poses. A very plain title cannot, there
fore, be secured by the settlers, but the
would-be colonists think that their rights,
if they cultivate the soil, will receive as
much respect as those of the sheep herd
ers and eventually the Government will
grant them titles.
THEATER WAR TAX.
Commissioner Heacock Decides That
the Proprietors and Not the
Lessees Must Pay It.
Proprietors of theaters and not the les
sees will be required to pay the war rev
enue tax of $100 per annum. This was the
purport of a decision given yesterday by
I'nited States Commissioner Heacock in
the case of the United States against
Henry McDonald, lessee of the Alham
bra Theater.
Judge Heacock said that it was unmis
takably the intention of the lawmakers
to tax the proprietor, not the lessee of a
theater, for the statute itself provides
that the tsCx on any theater under lease
prior to the time the statute went into
effect must be paid by the lessee.

BELVEDERE WILL

Water Carnival an
Assured Success.
AOvUI w d x^ wi www OO â¢
Next Saturday night the Venetians of
the Pacific, for the second time in the I
history of Belvedere, will decorate their s
homes with pyrotechnic' splendor to cele- â 
brate the nuptials of the Doge of Shag
Rock to the waters of San. Francisco j
Bay. There have been weddings before, !
and if humanity continues to jog along in )
the same old way there are likely to be j
weddings in the future. But nothing in J
the past has reached the magnificence of j
the splendor which will attend Belvedere's j
Saturday night marriage, and in the |
future it will keep coming generations j
guessing to outdo the munificence of their i
progenitors. ;
The cruiser llarblehead and the tor- ;
pedo-boat Farragut will reach the cove
Friday nigh: ' or Saturday morn- j
ing and anchor in deep water, where i
their searchlights will have a full sweep 1
during Saturday night's display. The I
barge upon which the Doge will go in j
state will be a dream of beauty. On the j
quarterdeck will be a column sur
mounted by the Golden Lion of St. Mark, j
In front of this will be the throne, under !
a canopy of crimson and gold. The Doge j
will be surrounded with his senators and !
embassadors. The barge will be towed j
by a gondola.
The parade of decorated boats will
start from Wheeler's Point, sweep around |
the rove, until it reaches the hotel where j
it will meet the barge of the Doge, which
will then lead the procession. A3 the line
starts the senators and embassadors will
chant an original ode, set to the music of
the national hymn of Hawaii. Following
this they will sing the Alton waltz, and at
the close they will sing "Lovely Night."
The procession of small boats will pass
before the committee of awards, which j
will be stationed on the ark El Piza. The
committee as soon as it arrives at its de- j
cision will announce the result through a
megaphone. The members are Hon.
Jauifa D. Phelan, Irving M. Scott. Robert
Howe Fletcher, Vanderlynn Stow and J.
A. Stanton.
Five thousand seats have been con- .
structed on the hills back of the Corin- :
thian Yacht Club, forming a perfect
amphitheater above the cove.
So that every one may know exactly
"what's doing" and that all the necessary
information may be easily acquired, the
following answers to these questions
which are most likely to suggest them
; selves are here published:
The Venetian Water Carnival at Belvedere
will take place Saturday night. September IS.
It will begin at 5:30.
You can see it without trouble.
You can see it without crowding.
Tou can ?ee it without danger.
You can see it without inconvenience.
You can see it without the annoyance of j
rough ar.d pushing crowds. .
You can enjoy a reserved seat. All this will j
cost you only $1.
The arrangements made by the committee of
Belvedere citizer.3 and the Corinthian Yacht
Club for your accommodation are perfect.
For s" you will be taken from San Francisco j
or San Rafael and given a comfortable re- ;
sen red seat on Valentine's Island.
No more tickets will be sold than seats are
provided. _.
Your seat will give you a perfect view -.'.
every part of the performance on the water. I
of the fireworks, the lights and decoration?, j
The path to the seats on Valentine's Island :
will be illuminated with electric lights. On ;
the island every arrangement has been made :
for your comfort.
Xo Intoxicating liquors will be sold.
There will be an ample force of police an.l I
members of the Corinthian Yacht Club to see i
that the ladles and children are treated with j
deference and courtesy.
The boats of the California, and Northwest- t
em Railway are among the finest and safest j
on the bay. They will leave the Tiburon ;
wharf at 7:15, 7:^o and 7:13.
It will not be nece-jsary to take the earlier '
beat to avoid the rush, as accommodations will |
be ample. But ii Is necessary to buy tickets at
once as their number is limited.
Th- boat of the North Pacific Coast Railroad ,
will leave the ferry slip at ' HI and will leave
BaaaaUto at 8:1s. Thts boat will not land iv
passengers on Valentines Island, but will lie :
outside the cove during the performance, giving .
Its passenger? a magnitlcent view. Price of !
tickets on this boat will be tl.
If ycu live on the line of the broad-gauge
road "you can -take this, boat from Sansallfn
ferry at 8:15 and the Jl ticket will Include the j
fare down to Sausalito and back to your home, j
If you live on the line of the broad-gauge
r-:ad "north of Tlburcn the â : ticket will In
clude fare from your home and back and a ;
reÂ»erve<! seat on Valentine's Island.
If ycu lire in San Francisco the 51 ticket will
hicl-de fare on the broad-gauge boats and a
r<;s<?rved seat on Vaiontine'3 Island.
Aii of these boats are. specially, chartered by
the B'elredere committee, and no other boats
will t>e allowed inside the cove.
No boats can land at Tiburon or Belvedere, i
excepting the boats of the California and !
Northwestern Railway, commonly known as
the Tinuron ferry.
Intending visitors are specially cautioned
against paying money for seats on boats other â 
than those chartered by the committee.
The Inspectors of Hulls and Boilers, warned ;
hy cast experience, will not permit any over- i
crowdinl prasoline launches, tug boats or river ;
bcat3 to l^ave th<?ir siips.
No launch' towiiv? barges will be permitted j
to carry passengers.
If ycu pay your money for any accomma
dation of that you will surely lose it.
By special permission of Assistant Secretary I
of the War Department Meikiejohn. the waters j
of Belvedere Cove have been placed under con- I
trol of the committee for the time of the en- j
tertainment, and no boats or craft of any de
scription, except such, as they charter, will
be permitted Inside.
Th'.s has been done because the explosion of :
submarine mines of dynamite, throwing enor
mous volumes of water In the air. will be a !
feature of the entertainment, and it would !
bÂ° dangerous to trust outside boats Inside the j
cove.
Persona intending to visit the residents of !
Belvedere should go over not later than the
6:30 o'clock regular boat. After that there
will be no buses to convey them up the hills,
nor will the roads be passable.
The roads at BelvadÂ«rÂ« are only the width
or a single vehicle. It Is impossible far ye- !
hicles to pass in safety except at the regu
lar switches, and this arrangement has been
made to Â»vent accident.
Buses will be provided by the committee to j
bring ladies visiting residents down the hill
to meÂ«Â»t returning boats to San Francisco. '
Gentlemen will be expected to walk, as bus
accommodation is strictly limited. i
The programme will Include the beautiful
anil picturesque ceremony of wedding the
Doge of Venice to the Sea, a male chorus of |
f_rty voices, a band of forty pieces, explosion I
of submarine mines, a magnificent display of
aerial fireworks, burning red fire on the ad- I
jacent hills and a display of not less than |
30,000 Japanese lanterns amid the trees and ,
houses of Belvedere Island.
If any funds remain unexpended after _Â»,â
ryinir out the celebration they will be &*â¢ j
voted to dredging the channel In front of
the Corinthian Yacht Club.

ness office, in the Claus Spreckels building;

ASK MONEY FOR
PROPOSED PARK
IMPROVEMENTS
Commissioners Ap-
peal to Supervisors.
The annual report of thÂ» Commissioners
of Golden Gate Park was filed with the
3pard of Supervisors yesterday afternoon
md a copy forwarded to the Governor.
Ihe report, which is signed by Commis
sioners A. B. Spreckela, Fred W. Ze'le and
W. H. Bfetson, is a voluminous document
md contains a vast amount of informa
:ion concerning the work done in main
lining- and beautifying the big pleasure
rround during the fiscal year ending June
!0. The opening- paragraph is an appeal
to the Supervisors to appropriate suffi
cient money to keep the park up to its
standard and to complete the im
provements already under way.
A great deal has been accomplished dur
ing the last year in constructing new
Irives and roadways and the Commission
?rs strongly recommend that means be
provided for the continuance of this work
on a larger scale. The Commissioners
especially urge that a boulevard be con
structed connecting the Presidio Park
system with Golden Gate Park: also that
1 boulevard or approach to the park be
:arried to Van Ness avenue. Here is an
other recommendation that is presented
lor the consideration of the Supervisors:
"Not less than fifty acres of land should
it once be purchased between Mission,
Twelfth and Townsend streets and the
water front, where children from the con
rested districts may exercise and play,
fhis park should not be created for the
purpose or' containing flower beds or ex
pensive improvements, but should be In
:he nature of a common. North of Mar
ket street the city is well supplied with
jpen spaces, parka and playgrounds, but
south of Market street, where the most
congestion exists, practically no provision
las been made for breathing spots or rec
reation grounds. The two small squares
:here situate are entirely Inadequate to
:he demands of that section of the city.
Children are compelled to resort for rec
reation to vacant lots and dusty or muJ
iy streets."
In support of the plea for these im
provements the Commissioners cite the
fact that thirty years ago the lands for
Irolden Gate Park were purchased for
Â£00.000 and the property is now worth $11,-
Ktt.QtjO. It is claimed that the increased
-ment on adjoining property by rea
son of its enhanced values, would net suf
icient revenue to pay interest on the in
vestment. The proposed boulevard to
:onnect the Park with the Presidio would
,n the opinion of the Commissioners, be
1 source of great value to San Francsico,
3y attracting the attention of the enure
:ountry.
The Commissioners also give a detailed
iccount of the work done on the proposed
:hain of lakes which is destined to prove
ane of the most attractive features of the
Park. The largest lake of the system, 1500
feet long, with a width varying from 400 to
UX> has already been completed and a
-oadwav built around it. These lakes are
to be studded with Islets and otherwise
beaurified. The work of beautifying
Buena Vista Park, which was beg dur
ing the past year, is also treated at con
siderable length.
The table of receipts and expenditures
shows that the amount of money from all
sources received during the year was
C5L095 o*s. while the disbursements foot

the Grand Hotel and secured rooms. Day
alter day passed and, although fully de
termined to die, she could not make up
her mind what route she should follow.
Wednesday last she secured a bottle of
chloroform and hid it In her room. That
evening she and Miss Denny went out and
! called upon some friends of the latter, but
returned to their rooms early. Soon aft
: erward Miss Prue swallowed nearly half
I the bottle of the drug she had brought
! home in the afternoon and was soon un
! conscious. Her condition was discovered
I by Miss Denny, who gave the alarm, and
L>r. Alfred J. Noble was summoned iroin
his rooms in the Palace Hotel. After
some hard work the life of the- young
woman was saved. â¢ ..
All night Miss Denny kept watch over
her friend, but yesterday morning MISB
Prue made an excuse to go into the bath
room and there she swallowed the re
mainder of the bottle of chloroform. As
soon as she was discovered the ambulance
was summoned and Miss Prue, accom
panied by Miss Denny, was hurried to the
Harbor deceiving Hospital. She reached
there about 11 a. m., and when placed on
the operating table went into hysterics.
The drug soon began to tell, however, and
then all the energies of Drs. Robinson and
Murphy were directed toward keeping her
awake. Until 1:15 p. m. they worked over
her unremittingly and then with a sigh or
relief were able to say "she is out of dan
ger."
Miss Prue was not a bit pleased at get
ting a new lease of life and said so. "The
greatest kindness you could have done me
was to have let me die," she said, to Dr.
Robinson. "I am only 20 years old and
have a good home, the doors of which are
open wide for me. but 1 won't go back. I
am weary of living and am going to die.
It may be to-morrow or it may be a week
hence, but die I will. The next time I'll
shoot myself."
Miss Florence Denny Is related to some
of the wealthiest people of Humboldt
County. She arrived hero from Eureka
on the steamer Pomona on August 25 last
and part of the time has lived at the
Grand and part of the time with friends.
When she went back to the hotel about
a week ago Miss Prue was there and their
acquaintance began then. Wednesday
Miss Prue ' received a letter from her
mother and in It was an urgent request
for her to come home and a notification
that a certain sum of money had been
forwarded to her through one of the
banks.
Miss Denny is of the opinion that Miss
Prue Is insane. She thinks tnai n m
nursing will do her good, and as
: ed will take her back t
llumboldt with her.

Organized Labor Metini^s.
At a meeting of the District Council
of Carpenters and Joiners last night the
rjuestion of the appointment of a special
agent to look after the fxcHisive interests
of the members of these branches was
discussed.
The increase of workmen together with
the magnitude of the council, it was
stated, would justify the appointment of
such an agent. This appointment, if made,
will be subordinate to and In conjunction
with the office of general agent, held by
Harry ..i. Saunders of the Building Trades
Council. The consent of the various
unions will be asked before the agent is
appointed. A like consent from the unions
will be requested in a communication
from the parent body regarding the call
ing of a union mass meeting looking to
an increase of wages of the carpenters
throughout the. city.
A petition was received from the stair
builders requesting that the council or
ganize them into a union. The applica
tion wan referred to Harry Saunders, who
is acting secretary, for his Investigation.
The Granite Cutters' Union elected W.
F. O'Donnell, P. C. Russell and Joseph
Prader as delegates to the Labor Council.
The electricians decided to affiliate with
th>- Labor Council and will elect delegates
at their next meeting. This union has
progressed rapidly during the past six
months. At the mooting last night eight
men were initiated and seven applications

BRAUNHART HAS
SURRENDERED TO
THE AUTHORITIES
Absurd Chase After
the Accused.
THE POLICE PLACED ON GUARD
PRELIMINARY HEARING TO BE
HELD TO-DAY.
Ex-Senator Dunn Intends to Prose
cute the Port Warden Vigor
ously â Local Politicians
Interested.
Samuel Braunhnrt, accused of perjury
, by ex-S^nator William J. Dunn, surr.-n-
I dered himself to the police yesterday
morning and was immediately released on
\ bonds. The accused man attributes his
arrest to spltework on the part of Dunn,
I but the interesting fact remains that two
reputable men of the city swear that the
i Port Warden used their names without
warrant and represented under oath
j scenes that never happened. The arrest
lof Braunhart has created considerable
: comment in political circles and the trial
j promises to be interesting-.
The arrest of Braunhart has provoked
from the police a series of explanations.
The warrant charging Braunhart with
'. perjury was placed in the hands of Police
Captain Spillane at 4:30 o'clock on Tues
j day afternoon. Braun hart's address was
: given and the question of arrest seemed to
i be one easy of solution. Acting Sergeant
| O'Meara was commissioned with the duty
of service and left the City Hall to bring
! Braunhart into custody. Sergeant O'Meara
had undertaken a serious clias.-. H.
hunted everywhere in the city, but the
accused man could not be found. Braun
hart was in his usual haunts, but the
police officer was always before or behind
him and could not find him.
As the hours wore on the chase became
amusing. In the different rendezvous of
politicians it was known that an officer
was seeking the Port Warden and wagers
were made that Braunhart would prob
ably prove the captor instead of the cap
tive. Sergeant O'Meara was doing his
best not to find the politician. It seemed
a? if the absurd game wire to be repeated
yesterday, but Braunhart took consulta
tion with himself and early in the morn
ing surrendered himsflf at police head
quarters. His bondsmen came with him
and he was immediately released.
The affair had become so serious from a
police point of view that at midnight on
Tuesday every police officer who left the
Central station at the c ';ty Hall was or
dered to be on the watch for Braunhart
and to bring him into custody if lie were
found. The Port Warden s;iwd th^ trouble
of a g( neral police raid by surrendering
himself.
His bondsmen are J. J. Harrigan, sec
retary of ttif Board of Port Wardens, and
Philip Cohen, a merchant residing at 729
Golden <;at.> avenue. Both qualified for a
| sum far In excess of the amount of the
I bond. Police Judge Conlan accepted the
bond and Braunhart was released.
His case will be called this morning by
Police Judge Thomas !â¢'. Graham, w\ â

ident haa announced that Colonel
Hamilton would receive tho appoint
ment.
Collector Jackson has the power to
fill the vacancy in tho cashiership
caused by the promotion of Colonel
Hamilton. The ofiice is excepted from
the olvll service regulations.
( 'ii! lector Jackson professed to be
Ignorant yesterday of the intention of
t)i>- President with regard to the pro
motion of the Naval Officer and the
cashier, and while he admitted that he
would have the power f> till the va
cancy in the cashiership and would
exercise that prerogative should a
vacancy occur, he declined to state
whether lv- had any one in view.
Colonel Hamilton was notified yester
day of his appointment by a dispatch
from Washington.
Colonel Irish would not talk on the
matter, beyond saying that he did not
know anything about the report that
he was to be appointed. The report
from Washington that Colonel Irish
was to be promoted is corroborated
by the fact that President McKinley
is grateful to him for not supporting
Bryan at the Presidential election, and
as he has an opportunity to select a
Democrat for the important position
of General Appraiser he knew of no
Democrat that he liked better than
the colonel.
The Board of General Appraisers
consists of nine numbers, each of
whom is placed in charge of one of the
nine districts into which the United
States is divided for the purposes of
the board. Colonel Irish will have
charge of the Pacific Coast division,
with the affairs of which he is well ac
quainted. He will continue his resi
dence in this State and will handle all
cases of disputed appraisement that
may arise on this side of the continent.

THAT DERELICT
RAFT HAS BEEN
SIGHTED AGAIN
Showed No Signs of
Breaking Up.
The tug Fearless returned to port yes
terday aft'-r H fruitless search of nearly
B w"k for the big log raft. The sooner
the derelict is picked up the better ship
ping men will be pleased, a.s owing to ti.e
dense fog that has hung over the ocean
for a wci'k past, it la one of the greatest
menaces to navigation ever adrift on the
Pacific.
There is now some hopes that the big
mass of logs may be brought in. Yester
day the bark Ferris S. Thompson arrived
from Chignik Bay, and Captain Murk re
ports Bighting the raft some miles above
Point Reyes. This was early in the day,
and in the evening the Czarina wasspcKen
and Captain Seaman was given the exact
position of the derelict. Everybody is
now hoping that the collier has once more
got iiold of the ran and will bring it into
port.
When Captain Murk saw the raft it
was intact and the American flag was
still flying. The Thompson nearly ran it
down in the fog, and it was only clever
seamanship that averted a collision that
might have proved fatal to the cannery
vessel.
The raft is just about in the position
where seafaring men said it would be
found. It drifted in a southeasterly di
rec fon until last Saturday, when the cur
rent took a northwesterly set, thus carry
ing the derelict back over its course.
Captain Marshall of the Fearless reports
a northwest current on Saturday. The
i Fearless went about forty miles off shore '
and cruised over 500 miles up and down
the coast at half speed. The tug was
stopped during the night and drifted with
the current. The fog was very heavy
all the time the vessel was out, and from
Saturday afternoon until Monday even
ing there was a dead calm.
The log on the bay yesterday morning
was very heavy, and all the ferry boats
were delayed in consequence. There were
some narrow escapes, but luckily no acci
dents.
Admiral and Mrs. Kautz gave a recep
tion to about twenty friends aboard the
lowa yesterday. Among those present
were Lieutenant and Mrs. Muller, Lieu- ;
tenant Sellers and the Misses McCalla,
daughters of Captain McCalla of the
cruiser Newark. The lowa's band dis
coursed sweet music throughout the after
noon. Owing to the reception no visitors
were allowed aboard the lowa, much to
the disappointment of a. crowd of people,
all of whom expected to get a close look
at the battleship.
The Harbor Commissioners let the con
tract for building the Santa Fe ferry slip i
at Main-street wharf to the City Street
Improvement Company yesterday. Its
bid was $30,890. while the highest was j
$34,814, that of Healy. Tibbitts & Co. These j
were the second lot of bids opened, the I
llrst lot having been rejected. On that oc
casion the lowest bid was $33,467. put in by ;
the Dundon Bridge and Construction Com
pany.
The auxiliary cruiser Badger returned !
from Eureka yesterday with the Naval ;
Militia The boys have been out a week,
and had a splendid practice cruise. They
had to live on naval rations and do all j
the work of a man before the mast. Yes
terday they had some splendid target
practice off Point Reyes, and good scores
were made. The boys disembarked last
night, well satisfied " with their week's
training.
Pat Meegan. a coal passer on the trans- |
port Sheridan, was nearly killed yester
day. A lump of coal fell from the bucket
on his head and nearly cracked his skull.
A badly lacerated scalp was dressed on
the hospital ship Relief, after which Pat
was taken to the Harbor Receiving Hos
pital. .

AT THE MECHANICS' FAIR.
The pupils of the Lowell High School
and the John Swett and Humboldt schools
attended the fair yesterday, and were ac
corded a hearty reception. To-day the
pupils of the Hearst Grammar, Moulder
Primary and the Peabody Primary
schools will be the guests of the institute.
To-morrow night the feature of the
musical programme will be the organ re
cital of Dr. H. J. Stewart. One or the
interesting additions to the exhibits at
the fair is the saddle of General Monte
negro, captured by Sergeant Fred Boyd
and companions of the American volun
teers at the battle of Malolos. General
Montenegro was wounded in the knee and
his horse was wounded also. The general
was taken fron\ his horse by his com
rades, but died from the wound before
the insurgents could move him from the
scene of action and his saddle was taken
from the wounded horse.

SUTRO HEIRS ARE ANXIOUS
TO SELL ELECTRIC ROAD
DENY TKAT SUTTEE, STREET
COMPANY HAS THE CALL.
The administrators of the Sutro estate
expect to dispose of the Sutro Electric
Railway on October 6, at which time bids
for the property will come before the
Probate Department of the Superior
Court. Rumors that the road was as good
as sold to the Sutter-street Railroad Com
pany are strenuously denied by represen
tatives of the corporation as well as the
administrators of the Sutro estate.
A bid of $IW,OOO has been made by a
broker, whose name is withheld, but V* .
R. H. Adamson. special administrator
of the estate, says positively that the
oiter is not made by the Sutter-street
Company. ,
The Probate Court granted permission
to Bell the property more than a month
ago and on September 5 an order was
Issued to show cause why the power
house should not be leased for a term of
five years at the nominal rental of $5 per
month. This order will be disposed of
October 6.
The Sutro road is looked upon with
covetous eyes by the Market street, Cali
fornia street and the Sutter street rail
road companies, and it is certain that one
of the three corporations has made the
bid now in the hands of the administra
tors, and that all of them will make offers
for the property when the matter reaches
the Probate Court.
Referring to the sale, Mr. Adamson
said:
"The estate has been anxious for some
time to sell the electric line and the ad
ministrators applied to the court about a
month ago to dispose of It. We have re
ceived a bid of $140,000 from a broker, but
1 can state positively that we have not
negotiated for the sale of the road to the
Sutter-street Company. All of these
matters have to go before the Probate
Court and we cannot dispose of the road
excepting to the highest bidder and then
only upon the court's approval of the pur
chase price."'
The Sutro Electric Railway is a stock
company, a majority of the shares being
held by "the Sutro estate. There are 40.000
shares altogether. Sixteen thousand of
them were never disposed of, 3000 were
sold off In small blocks and the balance
is owned by the Sutro estate. The cor
poration owns only the right of way,
tracks and rolling stock of the line, the
power-house not being included In the
company's property. At present the Sut
ter-street Company has a transfer agree
ment with the Sutro Company which the
California-street line is said to he anxious
to secure, and shut the rival concern out
of one of its most valuable privileges.
This would leave the Sutter-street Com
pany in the predicament of practically
commencing nowhere and ending at the
same place, up against the cemetery
fence, as was Its condition before the
Sutro road was built.
This situation would Indicate that there
will be a lively contest for possession of
the property when the sale comes before
the Probate Court October 6.
