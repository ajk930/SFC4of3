The San Francisco Call
The most sensational report
has obtained currency in Durban,
| Pietermaritzburg and Lourenzo
; Marques that General Joubcrt.
| commander of the Boer forces, is
dead, but a dispatch from Emit
court, ted Wednesday, says
that the Boers who captured the
wounded men from the armored
; train refused to give then) up tin
! til they have consulted Joubert.
Wednesday's fight between the;
| armored train from Estcourt and
i the Boers between Freere and
Chievcley stations, was a lively
aftair. The train was practically
destroyed. Fifteen men were
wounded on the British. side and
, about one hundred are missing
I or prisoners,. Including Lieuten
ant Winston Churchill, son .of
. Lady Churchill, who; displayed
Krcat bravery, encouraging the
men and assisting the â wounded.
t This' reconnoissance shows .that
; the r'ocrs. either because^hey^arc
tired of hammering away at
Ladysmith, ox because it is part
of their settled policy, are creep
ing south in tbe hope of cutting
British; communications. They
are at Chievelcy, the first station
out ,of CoJenso. They are below
Estcourt and not far from \Ves
ton en the Mooi River; : V . â¢ : '
Probably the Hoers with whom
the armored train fought are part
ofjottbeit's investing force, who
recently been at Pieters.

can be understood. On the west
ern frontier a r.ew stage of the
campaign is about to begin. Ma
feking has resisted the Doers so
successfully that General Cronje
is now reported t<Â» be directing
his efforts against Kimberley. It
is now kn<Â»wn that the relit f
movement toward Kimberley
commenced some time ago. The
Ninth Lancers. Northumberland
Fusileers, Minister Fusileers and
part of the Lancashires, who
some time ago were concentrat
ing at I )e Aar Junction, were on
Saturday last within fifty miles of
Kimberley. It was this column
which fought an en^a^ement on
the ioth i Friday) which resulted
in the loss of Lieutenant Coionel
Keith-Falconer.
The West Yorkshire Regiment
has arrived at Estcourt, being the
first of the reinforcements which
are being rushed up from Dur
ban. Everything- indicates the
eve of very important develop
ments in the region of the Or
ange River and along the line of
De Aar Junction. Colesburg.
Burghersdorp and Aliwal North.
In an official statement issued
by the War ( )ftice it is stated that
the arrangements for the relief of
Ladysmith are completed and
that the remaining troops will be
utilized in accordance with the
original plan of campaign arid
that (ieneral Buller has left Cape

Government, the Premier pointed out,
had to l>e juÂ«'j;ed on Its acts and the
projects before the Chamber. He do
noumed the machinal at of the Â«ucjnles
of the republic, and Justified the trial of
crnsplracy case? by the- high court on
thÂ» ground that evorythlrg was preparing
for an insurrection, and paid:
"We did not think we ought to wait
until the coup d'etat wo* accomplished.
In fact, the Chanihor will do us Justice.
The Government in respect the concor
dat, lint will never confuse the state and
recopnized clergy with certain religious
order*, which are Increasing in power and
mine more and more menacing."
These rt marks were greeted with re
newed Leftist cheers and. Rightist pro
tests. The Premier concluded with saying
the Government's pi aronM was ln>
Fpixvd by tho wish to constitute society
strong Â«noujth to Insure respect for the
oj>lnion of every one. and impt:sÂ« respect
for republican insiitutlotip, The pro
pnunme â¢ would serve as a rallying flog
for :UJ Republicans.
Former Premier Mellne snld he desired
BClther reaction nor revolution, and con
demned thtÂ» policy of the Government In
jriviiiK the Socialists access to power. He ,
then asserted that the high court, trial
could have bet;n svÂ«t before the ordlnarv
| courts, which drew forth violent Leftist
i protests. The speaker also said â  a op
posed the programme of the Government
and the treatment of General NegTlcr,
r.r.d said he wanted a conciliatory and not
an aggressive policy, as the country need
ed an Interim! peace In order to turn its
attention to foreign nations. Centrist' ap
! pla'.ise followed this remark. *
Several orders â¢ â ' the day were then pre- I
sent*.-d, and M. AVhldccli-Rousseau accpt

MRS. MAYBRICK MUST
SERVE HER FULL TERM
English Government Has Refused the
Request Hade by Secretary
of State Hay.
WASHINGTON*. N ,Â«. IS.-Hope for the
liberation of Mrs. Maybrick, confined In
an Knp:ish prison, has been given up by
tl><Â» State Department and her friends in
Washington. The British Government had
made an adverse repiy to the representa
tion? of Embassador Choate, declaring
that the case Is not one In which clemen
cy should be exercised and that Mrs. May
brick must, continue, to serve- her term of
lmj>riÂ»ioi:ment.
This reply Is very discouraging to the
onici.i!*. as the proposition for her release
had been advanced after iro.u earnest
pressure had been brought to bear upon
the British Government by Mr. Hay when
he was Kmbassador In London and "as Sec
retary of State and by Mr. Choate. The
officials believe that thÂ« publicity that has
been given to the matter, especially
through spetchts made by Michael Da
vitt. is responsible for the j>osition as
rurrf A by the British Government.
Secretary Hay will continue to do all he
can to sreure Mrs. Maybrlck's freedom,
but his efforts will probably prove futile

THE SAN FRANCTSCO CALL, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 17, 1899.
MODUS VIVENDI IS NOW
WORKING SATISFACTORILY
Indications Decidedly Against Reopening in the Immediate Future of
Negotiations Looking to a Permanent Adjustment of the
Alaska Boundary Question.
WASHINGTON, No*. Hâ The Indications are decidedly against any reopening In the Immediate future of negotia
tion! looking to a permanent .adjustment <>f the Alaskan boundary quefltlon. . It can be stated positively that then- has
lately BO Â« n this subject between the two governments since the return to u^s country of I>ord
fote. The Inodus vlvendl, which was adopted to define temporarily, the respective rights of the two parties, is
working satisfactorily. The Administration has convinced Itself that there Is little chance of securing th<- pproval of
Senate to any permanent treaty defining the boundary line which would secure the adhesion of Canada, and It Is
feared that even a moderate proposition looking to a compromise could not be framed that would meet with th<- approval
of birth parti'-s. This Is believe.". ' * true only of the prOOUIII time. The recent extraordinary development of the CapÂ©
Nome gold field* at the expense of the population of the Klondike may poaalbty make the question easier of adjustment
In the future by dlmtnlshlng the value of the Issues b.-tween the two countries. Once the Klondike in relegated to Its for
mer eondttloa and the Incentive to reaoh it froni the sea is removed. It Is felt that there will be a dlmlnisUea Interest on
tin- {.art Df I'anada In Its claims to that seaport:
MBaretto as liÂ« thought, and It went off.
The particular* of tin- sad affair, wore
told in Vhe Call exclusively last May.
Captain Buckley was burled at Ht.
Lawrence Island.
A couple of .v? before li.-Â» captain ac
cidentally shot hlmFelf Gns Smiley, one
of the sailors, fell overboard and was
drowned. It was pitch dark at the time
and though a boat was lowered ana the
poor fellow's cries could be heard for
several minutes he could not be round.
The John and Winthrop had a most un
eventful cruise of ten months. Only one
whiile was taken. The vessel was oft
l'uint Arena on the lUh lust., and ever
since Captain Macomber has been trying
to beat hie way Into port There were
no casualties during the voyage.
On the steam whaler Thrasher the men
complain that they were not properly
treated by Captain Sherman. They as
sert that one of the crew was unmerci
fully beater, and that none of them had a
too pleas.-uit cruise. Th. captain denies
the stories in toto, but the sailors assert
that they nro I ng to complain to the
United States District Attorney. The
Thrasher lost one. of tho blades of her
propeller in the Arctic and came home
the greater part of the Journey under
.'â¢ill.
i The Belvedere broke her crank shaft
and had to drag her propeller home She
Kavesjill i;.-: coal to the steam whaler
Fearless, and that la how Captain Mr
! Kenna was able to spend another winter
:In the Arctic. The Belvedere took five
i whale*? 'luring the season, and would
â  have don* better had It not been for the
breakdown In her machinery.
ThÂ» is a romance mixed up with
the stories of disasters and death
brought nby th*> whaling tleet. Two
1 young men have bet-n malting cruises to
the Arctic for several years in the hopes
: of making enough money to Ret married
j und settle down. lacy are Antone Mar-
Kariilo, second mate of the bark Cali
fornia, a.nd Joe Avel'.ar. boatheader of
the Charles W. Morgan. Both vessels
â  have had vtry siucrsfÂ«l â¢"'â '> ' and â â 
soon as Antone and .! â¢â¢ are paid off they
are Ing to New Bedford, where they'll
"set the clerk a-slnging and the wedding
bells a-ringing."
MUCH WRANGLING OVER
KENTUCKY'S RECOUNT
Work Proceeding Very Slowly, While
Charges and Counter Charges
Are Uc.de.
LOUISVILLE] Ky.. Nov. 16.â The work
of tabulating thÂ«Â» elections in Louisville Is
progressing *Â«o slowly that.it is hardly
poobable that all of tho precincts of the
city will be counted before next Tuesday
or Wednesday. Numerous wrangles uoour
daily at the sessions of the Board of Elec
tion Comnuhsloner:* which delay the
progress of the count. The Democrats
nave given notice that they will contest
the vote in several precincts on account
of the fact that the lJeini.cr.itic otlicers
of ihe precincts as well us Democratic
voters nad been intimidated by soldiers.
When the vote of the Twentieth Precinct
of the Ninth Ward was readied by the
Commissioners to-day It was found that
there wan no complete record of the vote.
Jc'i.f Harris, Democratic counsel, said
he would produce affidavits to prove that
it.-- Democratic officers In this precinct
were frightened away from the voting
places by the report that Governor Brad
ley's soldiers wire coming. On this ac
count they had been unable to make out
the returns. Mr. Kink' a. 1. for the Re
publlcans^ald he would produce evidence
to show that the soldiers were never
within a mile of the precinct and that
the Democrats had other reasons for not
r'.pning the returns. The board voted to
pass the precinct until later.

their complicated nature. He thought
the United States should train Its men to
build emerj vessels, as they were
more to tie depended upon than those It
tcik two or three years to build.

them." he said; "but can we? The ability

waiting for two hours another Boer came
and Informed Dr. Brlsloe that as General
Joubert was very far away no answer to
the request could be furnished until to
morrow morning." The Boer said that If
Dr. Hrl.-slue would then return with n
white flag he could count upon a reply
from General Jpubert. Dr. Brlsloe In-
Quired whether there were many wound
ed. The Boer replied that he had heard
there were about seven. Ho declined to
give ;:ny Information regarding Lieuten
ant Winston Churchill. It haa rained all
day and Is still raining.
ESTCOURT, Nov. 16â Seven of the Dur
bans have Just come In, making twenty
three missing. Only fifteen of the Dubllna
have returned. The Natal seven-pounder,
which was In front of the true*, had fired
three shots when It was shattered by the
Boer artillery. The -armored engine has
many bullet marks and Its dome cover Is
smashed, as also is Its automatic exhaust
pipe and twenty-five ton screw Jacket.
The tender is also pitted with bullet
marks. It Is rumored that Lieutenant
Churchill Is a prisoner.
DURBAN, Natal. Nov. 16.-The Natal
Advertiser has a dispatch from Estcourt
which says:
"When part of the armored train was
overturned by the Boers turning up tho
rails the British alighted and exchanged
volleys with the Boers. The engine-driver,
when the rails were replaced, seeing the
position was hopeless, steamed back to
Estcourt with a few of the Dubllns and
fifteen of the Durbons, including Captain
Wylle, who was wounded, on the tender.
The fate of the remainder of the Durban*
and Dublin! and of Lieutenant Churchill
Is .unknown."
The Natal Mercury, describing the en
gagement, says:
''The enemy apparently opened fire with
a Maxim and two nine-pounders, getting
tho. range accurately. The lire was so
severe that telegraph wires and poles
were destroyed. Their guns were posted
on a kopje covered with brushwood and
their sharpshooters were hidden behind
bowlders. The Dubllns and volunteers,
lighting an unequal battle, thrice drove the
enemy back, but the fierceness of the riflo
and big gun fire was too much for the
brave little party, which was weakened
at the outset by the overturning of the
trucks hurting several.
"Lieutenant Churchill's bravery and
coolness were magnificent. Encouraged
by him, all worked like heroes In clearing
tho line to enable the engine and tender
to pass." .
Later details show that a heavy rain
and mist compelled a cessation of firing.
Lieutenant Churchill bravely carried the
wounded to the rear under fire. While the
Boers were destroying the train their
scouts pushed In and exchanged shots
with the British pickets a few miles from
Estcourt. It appears that the Boers were
in ambush. As soon as the train had
passed up they emerged from cover and
dislodged the sleeper bolts.

SKULL FRACTURED

Raisin Inspector Sims
Dying in Fresno.
Sperlal Dl*pÂ»tch to The CalL
FRESNO, Nov. 16â W. Sims., an inspec
tor In the; employ of the California. Raisin
Growers' Association and a .well Known
resident of this city. v.as taken; to. the
County Hospital to-day suiTerinÃ -from
what Ma physicians declare is a" : fracture
of the .skull. He Is sinking irapMly, and
little hope Is entertained for his recovery.
; Sims was in Los Angeles In company
wlthThomas Eagan of this city last Sat
urday evening. While walking along a
street they met a man who. : appeared to
be Insane. : He asked Sims a number <?{
foolish questions, which the latter., fulled
to answer. The crazy man then became
exasperated , and picking up a 'cobble
stone hurled it at Sims. "I'll not leave
you to tell any tales either," said he,
turning to Eagan. The latter, however,
took to his heels and escaped the lunatic.
As soon as possible help was summoned
and Sims was taken to a drug store near
by. In about an hour he regained con
sciousness and the wound over- hU car
was dressed. Blood flowed from his ears,
mouth and nose. On the next 'train he
was brought to Fresno by Eagan and felt
much better after reaching home.
On the day^ following his arrival he
called on Dr. Davidson, who examined the
wound and pronounced it serious. He at
tended to it and told Sims to call on him
apaln the next day. The raisin Inspector,
however, went about his business and
disregarded the advice of the physician
about calling nÂ»Â»xt day. Yesterday morn
ing 1.l- eyeldls und cheeks began to swell
t.nd he complained of dizziness. : Several
dot-tors expressed the opinion :ha.t the
base of his skull had been fractured and
that the chances for his recovery were
very remote. ;~ â :. â  ; ,
It is not known here whether the Los
Angeles lunatic has been arrested or not.

iron. Bird B. Colrr, Controller of Greater
New York, discussed 'The City's Power
to Incur Indebtedness Under the Pro
posed .Municipal Programme."
Mr. Colfr. after referring to the early
financial dlHlculties of Greater New Tori:,
referred to the restriction of Indebtedness
of cities, and said:
"A city issues bond* only for perma
nent improvement, the benefit* of which
Inure to posterity. But there are two
classes of these improvements, easily dis
tinguishable from one another, and be
tween which a sharp distinction should
M drawn. In one of these clauses are im
provements which. white adding to th.Â»
beauty and healthfulness of a city, brine
In no direct financial returns. This is by
far the more numerous clans and Include
such ordinary works as the erection of
public buildings, the acquisition of parka
and the repaying of turrets.
"The expense Incurred Is unquestiona
bly a financial burdtn upon thÂ« taxpayer
In regard to such expenditures there can
bÂ«? no doubt as to the wisdom of estab
lishing an arbitrary constitutional limit.
since otherwise the burdens that might
be thrown upon succeeding generation*
by excessive issues or bonds would be
come intolerable.
"There Is another etaM of Improve
ments, however, far less commonly met
with, which either results in casting no
burden whatever on the taxpayers or else
brings In actual profit to the municipal
ity. A dim recognition of this truth
seems already to have found expression
in State constitutions, which specifically
except from the operation of thin limi
tation bond* Issued to provide for the sup
ply of water ajid require only that a spe
cial Sinking fund be established for thHr
ultimate redemption."
Mr. Coler held that the bond Issues In
such cases were not a real burden since
water nts pay the Interest and reduce
the principal. Under no conditions did
he favor buying franchises to further mu
nicipal ownership, advocating the Idea of
waiting until they run out and then tak
ing them. In case of perpetual franchises,
ho did not believe they would stand ih
test of the Supreme Court of the United
States.
Following Mr. Color's address there was
a general discussion of the subject. In

pated: Hon. William Dudley Foulke of

MORE TRANSFER TROUBLES.
R. V. Emerson Ejected From a Mc-
Allister Street Car by Triple
Alliance.
R. V. Emerson, residing at 433 Guer
rero street. Is the latest victim of the
Market-Ptreet Railway Company. Mr.
Emerson last evening boarded a Powell
street car at SarramÂ«-nto street. . At
Powell and Market streets he transferred
to a car of the McAllister street line.
When called upon for his fare he tendered
the green pasteboard. This was refused
<<n the ground that the time limit allowed
by tho company had expired.
Upon his rÂ»-fu.'ir.K to pay another fare
hÂ« was told to get off the car. This he
refused to do. The conductor then un
successfully uttempted to throw him. oft.
By this time taÂ»* car had reached the
point where it leaves Market street, and
the conductor stopped it while 'he called
on the gripman to aid him in throwing
Emerson off.
Th* gripman. flourishing a long iron
bar, stepped threateningly toward Erner
pon. who started to get off. Not content
with this, the -conductor took a hand in
the (tame and grabbÂ»-d him by the arm
to accelerate his movements. Thlp Em
erson nsented and. thereupon was set
upon by the conductor, who. beat him
about . the face. .â  Emerson retaliated
and victory was within his grasp
when the Fwltehmnn who Is sta
tioned at that corner Joined In
the me!Â«H\ and before the triple
alliance Emerson wns forced to' beat a
retreat. He will, however, fight the case
with the more subtle weapon.* of the law,
and s.ays that if there is justice in the
land Conductor 209 and Gripman _â  . uf the
McAllister street line will pay dearly for
their victory.

Wednesday afternon J. J. Groom was
seen to emerge from the bathhouse ac
companied by v woman. As they started
up tne street Mrs. Groom rushed from a
doorway where she had been concealed
and struck a vicious blow at either her
husband or Mrs. Hetherington, it was not
possible to tell which. At any rate Groom
was the first to realize the danger, and
warded off the blow with his arm. The
weapon used by Mrs. Groom was a heavy
handled umbrella, and as it struck ti:-Â«
arm of her husband it glanced upward
and struck Mrs. Hethenngton on the
forehead, cutting an ugly gash. The cries
of the injured woman soon brought a
crowd to the scene of action.
Mrs. Groom was expressing her opinion
of her husband in no very mild tones,
while her husband, although he made no
direct reply to her reproaches, tried in
every reasonable way to ijuiet the infuri
ated woman. He was much handicapped
on account of his companion, ho re
quired his constant protection, but by
careful tactics he managed to keep him
self between his angry wife and Mr?.
Hethennsrton until a policeman eared
on the scene. . .
The officer; who selmed to understand
the situation, used the best of judgment
when he removed the cause of ail the
trouble in the person of Mrs. Hethering
ton. This gave the husband a chancw to
reason with his wife. He told hor how
foolish she was to make such a scene on
a public street, and how much better it
would be if they were to defer the matter
until tht-y could converse in private. By
this time the policeman had returned to
the battlefield and demanded to know
what all the trouble was about and who
had been guilty of the assault on Mrs.
Hetherington.
This scorned to anger ' the wronged
wife anew. "I did it." she exclaimed. 'I
am Mrs. J. J. Groom: this man is my
husband. You know who I am; now why
don't you arrest me? I want to be ar
rested. Now. why don't you arrest me?
1 want the world to know just what kind
of a man my husband Is."
Through the diplomacy of the officer
and Groom the lady was at last Induced
to leavo the place and return to her
home. Nobody was able to tell what be
came of Mrs. Hetherlnsrton. except that
she made her escape through the back
door of the grocery-

The chairman announced that the
meeting was in' accordance with me reso
lution adopted by the orticers of the First
California Volunteers oh board of the
United fe tales transport Sherman on me
way me irom. Manila, and he men call
ed attention ti> the order of me com
mander in chief, directing that tne tie.d,
start ami line officers ana the men wno
entered from the Natlunal Guard from
the First Infantry report bat X lor duty
by the 3'Jth inst.; also to the fact that
there are canteens, haversacks' and leg
gings for tne regiment, and that rines
enough can beoDC-ained on short notice
from the United States arsenal at Be
nlcia. â¢
lie also stated, that eaon company com
mander had been furnished wlin a muster
roll and duplicate which must be rilled '
out as soon as possible and returned to
regimental headquarters before the 2Uh
Inst.. 10 that there may be a transmission
to superior headquarter! at Sacramento
by the 30th inst. *. , . w
The otlicers will report back In the po
sltions they held prior to enlistment in
thÂ« volunteer service, and all the men
who did not enlist in the volunteers, those
who did enlist and those who were not
members of the guard, but volunteered in
the regiment that went to Manila, are to
sign the muster roll if they desire to re
enler When this shall have been done
the regiment will receive btllclal recogni
tion, and that â rill be in the early part of
December. â 'â , â 
After this h.i - been accomplished all
men who remained behind and whose
term of service expired since June. 198,
will be discharged from the service, and
if they desire to re-enlist they will have
to undergo physical examination, but
those who were In the volunteer service
will not have to undergo such examina
tlon.
A question was asked if men who have
already served two terms of three years
and would have put one more year to
serve to entitle them to exemption certifi
cates and whose second term expired
Bince June. IS'jS. would have to undergo
the severe physical examination pre
scribed.
The answer was that no provision had
been made for that, but that in all prob
ability that could be arranged In a sat
isfactory manner.
Five of the companies have already
held meetings and a number of men have
signed the rolls. The other seven com
panles will meet during the ttrst days of
the coming week, and all will be In readi
ness to make the reports on time.
The regiment, it is expected, will be
fully equipped In January if the uniform.-*
are ready by th;: - time, but that is
t.iin. as the matter of the double contracts
for r.; .-*- ti now I-- :'or<- th.- Governor
and there is a possibility that it will not
be allowed to stand, and to rcadvertise
for bids will cause delay.
HONOR THEIR PASTOR.
Rev. G. G. Eldredge Tendered a Re-
ception by the Ladies of St.
John's Presbyterian Church
One of the most delightful receptions of
the Season was that tendered last night
by the ladles of St. John's Presbyterian
Church to the Rev. and Mrs. G. G. Eld
radge. Mrs. N. G. Kittle, at whose beau
tiful home on the corner of Stelner street
and Pacific avenue the affair was held,
acted as hostess. She was assisted in re
ceiving by the following members of the
Ladies' Aid Society of St. John's: M M
H. L. Reed, Mrs. C. Taylor. Mrs. M.
Boyd. Mrs. Craig. Mrs. Boiler and II -
M. McLaln. The parlors, thronged with
guests, were beautifully decorated with
white chrysanthemums and violets, the
corners being converted Into' bowers of
living preen with fragrant boughs of the
pepper tree. After being presented to
their pastor the nests were entertained
with music and singing, the following la
dies and gentlemen giving their services:
H. Bradley Smith. Mrs. G. F. Sham Mrs.
R. M. Gllchrlst and a quartet comprising
Mrs. Roller, Miss C Weir, C. Somers and
Mr. Balnaves; Several of Mr. Eldredge's
fellow-ministers were present, among
them being. th. Rev. J. B. Roberts. Rev.
D. James and Rev. J. Woodworth.
When Mr. .Eldredfte undertook the pas
torate of the church some months ago It
was a question as to whether or no it
should be kept up. But since he has been
at the helm the parochial affairs have
assumed a much brighter aspect, and the
reception was held partly as a means of
showing him the gratitude felt by the
congregation for his able management of
the church affairs. â

THE W^TER CONVENTION.
' I "II X conclusions reached by the convention as
i 10 storage ar:d <liÂ«tribuuoa of ''(V.'i water for
* irrigation and power prove to be a compromise
between the national 'and State plans, in which the
stockmen, who dotftwant irrigation,- but who do

The resolutions propose that Federal efforts be
supplemented by such State appropriations as may be
useful and necessary, and a divided jurisdiction is
provided for ihst will probably prove a failure if it is
ever tried. Such division usuiHy results in neither
jurisdiction doing anything, and laying its failure on
the ether.

In fairness; to the managers of the convention it
must be" said that the subordinate position finally as
sumed by all propositions that the State shall; help;
itself 1 -was due .to the attitude, of the ticqf leading
political panics of the State, In their platforms, both
parties have â¢canVinirjrd. strongly., against /any.- State'
appropriation ' whatever' \ for â¢ .irrigation . purposes.
Knowledge of this made it evident ; ; tp the convention
that i a prcliminanv period ': o{-> .education.;, must- btf
passed in which the politicians. would see a light jus
tifying a change in the attitude of parties in that re
spect before the State . ccn be put â¢in ; a : : position to
stop the waste of its propettyin the llood water and
convert it into. one of the most important and pro
ductive <yl utilities. " 'â '.'/:â â .:. ';:.â â â -. â¢'â¢"â '' : .' ; :.' .:'â¢â¢â â¢â â¢'; v"' ' ' â  , . : -
One feature in the Federal plan was lost -sight of.
Public improvements by the Federal Government are
slowly and wastcfully accomplished. : Its jurisdiction
over harbors and havi gable rivers is suprcmej- and scj
erratic are the appropriations and their administra
tion that it is probable that every dollar spent pro
duces only fifty cents' worth of results. The harbor
work in California, from San Pedro to. Kureka, illus
trates this vexation of Federal delay. Another mis
taken idea wrnt unconnected in the convention.
Storage reservoirs created by the State would proceed
upon the idea that each individual enterprise should
stand upon the revenues it would derive from the use
of the water. If a reservoir were to be constructed
its creation would be preceded by an exact ascertain
ment of the acreage it would serve. The various
qualities of the land in that acreage would be known,
foreshadowing the most profitable use to which it
could be put, and the maximum price for water pos
sible to each of its uses. The amount of water re
quired for its service would be ascertained by a study
of the porosity of the soils and the rate of evapon
tion. Then the watershed draining into the reservoir
would be delimited, the average annual rainfall
thereon weald be known, nd the capacity of the
reservoir for the service required would be found.
With these engineering facts at* hand it would be
easy to find the cost of the reservoir and of its main
tenance and of the distribution of the water, and
then if the revenue would provide for the annual in
terest on the bonds issued and produce a sinking
fund to take up the principal at maturity that indi
vidual reservoir would be carried by the land which
it serves, and there is no charge upon the general
taxpayers of the State for either interest or principal.
As there is no doubt that the State must do, even
tually, anything useful or significant that is done in
this matter the permanent organization created by
the convention will do well to begin immediately the
process of education in line with the. foregoing idea.
The operations of the iron and steel trust as re

the extension to them of the equality for which this

The New York Pres-s, one of the most intolerant

through the mediums; of expositions lias long since
been pointed out. and strenuous efforts have been
made on this coast to educate the East and the Gov
ernment on the subject. It is therefore gratifying to
know, that at last some results have been, accom

There are not likely to be many expositions of
note in the United States during the coming year,
for Paris will attract too much attention for an or
dinary exposition to prove profitable. After Paris,
however, we shall have expositions on a grand scale
and considerable numbers. Buffalo. St. Louis am!
New York arc already preparing for such enter
prises, and of course they will seek to get conces
sions for Chinese.. It is pleasing to know thÂ« Treas
ury has its mind on the problem of preventing the
enterprises from resulting in a permanent addition

to the Chinese population of the country. It will be
better to have fewer oriental features at the exposi
tions than co many Chinamen.
A clever swindler, who graduated in this city and
took an Eastern post-graduate course in crime, ha 3
been caught telephoning to himself all sorts of prop
erty belonging to other people. He might have saved
unnecessary annoyance and reached his present end
by telephoning directly to jail.
TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES.
NO feature of the prevailing prosperity of the
United States has attracted more attention or
is more worthy of it than the extent to which
tiie demand for transportation has outrun the supply,
and the efforts now being put forth to meet the in
crease in the demand which is certain to come next
year. According to reports that come to us there
were placed during the month of October with a
single car company orders for 21,100 cars to be de
livered by next May, and with another company up
ward of 12,000 cars to be delivered by the same date.
These are the orders received within the space of a
single month by two car-building corporations alone.
It is said the New York Central will expend in pre
paring for the transportation demands of the coming
year upward of $8,000,000 for rolling-stock, and the
expenses of the Pennsylvania Central will not be far
short of that sum.
This enormous increase in the railway facilities of
the country will be required to carry the produce of
American farms, mines and factories down to the
seacoast, for a very large and increasing proportion
of that produce is intended for foreign markets.
When it has been carried to the sea, then what?
While we are making such preparations to transport
the freight across the continent, why not finish the
work by providing transportation to carry it across
the sea?
This is the only great nation In the world that neg
lects its shipping interests, and yet there is no nation
that would derive a greater benefit from the promo
tion of those interests. As has been repeatedly pointed
out, Great Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Russia,
Spain, Holland, even Japan, now expend from two
millions to six or eight millions annually for this
purpose. Norway, which long stood alone in
Europe, has lately established a bounty for domestic
ship-building. The United States, the chief expo
nent in all the world of the protective idea, is the only
nation which now adheres to a non-protective policy
toward its merchant marine.
There was a time when persons directly -interested
in the shipping Industries -stood almost alone in ad
vocating : a policy of protection jto our . merchant
marine;. :i It is for that reason mainly that such pro
tection has not. yet been accorded. ..; Of late, â¢ how
ever, the -manufacturers are perceiving that their in
terests arc to be served by liberal shipping laws. and.
their influence is added to that of sbip-builders and
ship-owners in urging the importance of the subject
upon Congress.; Â"V-;j â¢' â -"-. â :â  .-; '..â¢;â¢ â 'â  ~ : 'i '.' â 'â  "â 'â 
A recent number of the American Manufacturer, in
discussing the enormous export trade of the country.
said: "It is estimated that $200,000,000 i* annually
paid for transportation of American goods from
American ports in foreign bottoms. We are selfish
enoug â¢ â¢ that if Congress should enact legis
lation to enable American vessel-owners to handle
the bulk of this enormous tonnage. Which is increas
ing, a ship-building boom would be started
which would continue for a decade or more that
would tax the capacity of all the steel and iron plant-?
and the shipyards of the United State*, together with
hundreds of new enterprises that would be born
from such a necessity as the building of American
vessels. A subsidy paid to American vessel-owners
would bring on a boom that would totally eclipse the
wonderful prosperity the country is enjoying."
Such are the transportation problems which our ex
panding prosperity has brought about We are to
have a vast increase in our rail; \ ay facilities and ought
to have a proportionate increase in our shipping.

MARCONI'S EXPLANATION
OF THE HERTZIAN WAVES.
MARCONI'S II>EA OF THE WAT THE HERTZIAN WAVES TRAVEL.
MR. MARCONI was asked to express In a rough way on paper: his con
cept Jon of the Hertzian wave that. conies from the vertical wire bunging
from the mast. A card had t><s en prepared with a pencil sketch of: the
. diagram he-re shown In the figure, supposed .to represent an Upright polo
or mast from which hangs the Marconi vertical conductor.. Quick asÂ» a flash
Marconi seized thp pencil and by a single; down-and-up stroke made the two
"wave marks" shown In the Illustration, and/ with the words "1.,0ng wavesâ
like that "was off. - : . -.'â 'â  â .:â â 'â '/ 'â â â  â¢?-''.-VÂ»i ' : -.".' - â â¢.'â¢':â¢â  .â¢. . : ':.-.â â  â¢â¢'. .
;â¢. As Mr,". Marconi, was ..not, available; Mr. Densham was afterward aaked to ex
plain this diagram more fully, and : he stated that the .figure to the right of
the diagram 'gives. 'a- more correct, idea 7 of the way the Marconi people con
ceive, the theoretical appearance of the wave. '.- '-But '"â¢i'ii.st how the wave mUht
start from the wire was a question. Mr. Densham stated further that practice
seemed. to prove that the wave was about four times the' length of the wtre. aj
ln<!!'iited in. the diagram. Remembering,. therefore, that the general standard
height of the vertical wire, now employed by Marconi Is IK) feet, this would
make the wave, say, 600 feet as It leaves: the 1S&- foot^vertlcol conductor.;
. â¢:-. Mr. Donsham was asked "what waM. the. efTect of an Increased spark length
or. electromotive force; whether the length .-of a spark gave an Increase of the
distance reached; by;. a message.' His answer was to the affect that It made very
little ;differcnce : after. certain points. ;â¢â¢ "â¢ -..â .:â¢ : .-i-.':- â¢â¢:'â¢; â "â¢.â¢.'.'.: â <.â ;' V â¢

ployed by Mr. Maro.nl In- the^ "lino pi directing Hertzian waves, but the an
twer came with a smil* that on. this subject '.they "had nothing to say." ' \
'.. In view of the tests to which the Marconi system has thus far been submitted
It seems safe to assume that It has 1 reached an entirely .practical stage, and is

HOW CARPETS ARE CLEANED-H..
Oakland. Cal. Carpets are cleaned on the
floor, but the result is never as satisfac
tory as when the carpet Is tlrst taken up
and thoroughly shaken. It is asserted
that a handful of salt sprinkled on a car
p i.v. . n the sweeping carry the dust
with it and make the carpet look brlpht
and clean. A very dusty carpet may bo
cleaned by dipping the broom In cold
water, shaking off all drops from the I
broom, sweeping a yard or so at â  time.
:iii en .. wasnln * th#Â» broom and repeating
till all is swept. It is said that to Improve
tli.- appearance of a carpet, ii pint of ox
gall should be used to a pailful of water.
After the. use of this mixture rinse with i
a sponge dipped in cold water to remove '
the ox-gall, then sponge oft as dry M
possible and wipe with dry raj to ab
sorb the moisture. In sweeping Axmln-
Bter carpets brush always the way of the
pile: by so doing the carpet may be kept
clean for years. If the broom Is used in
a different way all dirt will enter the car
pet and soon spoil It.
FOUR-LEAVED CLOVER-S. T. W.i
Byron. Cal. Among the uneducated
classes, any strange or unusual forma

more or less superstition. A double nut,

these thlriK* are always plucked when
found an'lkpp" "for luck." Hut the Â«v

STOLEN JEWELS

MANGLED BODY
Delia Tracy's Hus
band Is Missing.
SAID TO BE A BOLD BURGLAR
HIS PAL NOW AN INMATE OF
FOLSOM PRISON.
Charged With Breaking Into a House
on Oak Street â Detectives
Anxious to Apprehend
Him.
The detectives are satisfied that the va
rious articles of Jewelry which were found
on the body of Delia Tracy, who was
foully murdered In a Turk street lodging
house last week, did not rightfully come
Into hi â¢ ;nn. They claim with con
siderable poslti\ en<*ss that the Jewelry
wh-s stolen by the man who she claimed
wus her husband. The jewelry Is now
In the hnnds of the police and they are
making â¢ v. ry t ffort to llnd the owner of
the property.
According to the detectives who are
working '>n th<? ease, Tracy and a former
Lined Mason, who Is now serving a
Qve-year tern In Folsom, some time ugo
robbed the safe In the Louvre at the in
tlon tif OFarreU and Market
rtrecti .:â â¢ -i some valuable pa
m dajra after the n
i letter to Schwartz, the proprietor,
telling him that they would meet him at
at the ferry and n turn
the papers to him providing he gave them
â¢
Schwartz went to the ferry and was
met by a stranger, who whispered to him
that he had thÂ»Â« stolen documents. The
proprietor. at the Louvre foolishly gave
the stranger, the amount asked for and
was handed over the papers. . After re
turning: to his place of business he noti-
Jieil the police of his transaction and two
detectives were at once sent to the ferry
to apprehend' the mysterious stranÃcr.
i After a -diligent search they failed to mid
i him. â¢ . -.> â¢â¢
The detectives also claim that Tracy
w:is witlv -Mason when the latter broke
into a hou*Â»e on Oak 'street and got away
with considerable jewelry. As. they were
leaving: the house one of th? occupants
opened (|rd-"on them; but failed to stop
their, flight. /Mason was shortly after
word arrested for the prime, but for lack
nf : evidence he Was acquitted, a few
weeks later, he broke into the room of a
Mrs. Hill in the Parmalee House and stole
several hundred dollars' worth iof Jew
elry. It claimed that True was with
him at the time, but -did not enter the
room. Subsequently Mason was. arrested
and charged with burglary. He was con-,
victed-of the. crime in the Superior Court
and waji sÂ«it to Folsom for (Ive x;ears.
The unfortunate woman had been living
with Tracy for some time, and It in
claimed isho was .â¢ (liar with his nefa
rious calling. The ilndfng of the stolen
Jewelry on her body exposed her bus
pahd'i character, and now the police are
looking for. Tracy. : : - â¢ â '. â  'â 
Since : the jewelry was turned over to
the police Tracy, evidently fearing arrest,
has lÂ«ft the city. Last night Captain
Hohen had Detective Kd Gibson scouring
the city for Tracy, as he is very anxious
to interview him in regard to the sup
posed stolen Jewelry. Gibson visited the
various haunts of criminals in the ten
derjoin district, but failed to get a trace
of the much sought for man.
To-day the police will redouble their ef
forts in apprehending Tracy. "

DENOUNCES SLANDERS ON
THE AMERICAN SOLDIERS
Chaplain McKinnon Defends General Funston and
Declares That Churches Were Desecrated
by Filipinos and No One Else.
SANTA CLARA, Nov. 16 âRev. Father William D. McKlnnon delivered
here on Wednesday night a lecture that In many respects possesses
national Interest and Importance. The reverend gentleman's words
should settle once and for all the malicious slanders and venom
ous clatter ( .f the yellow Journals against the conduct of American
soldiers In the Philippines. There Is no one better qualified to know
than Father McKlnnon what has been the conduct of American troops In
reference to churches In the Philippines. There Is no one more deeply con
cerned In telling the true story of what has happened than he, and last
night he declared with solemn emphasis that the American troops have not
looted churches, nor stolen vestments and precious relics, nor desecrated the
sanctuaries they encountered in their campaign.
Father McKlnnon delivered his lecture to a large and appreciative audi
ence In Santa Clara College Hall. Considerable Incidental Interest was given
to the affair, as the reverend speaker has recently been appointed by Presi
dent MiKinley a chaplain In the regular army, and, after a splendid service
with the First California Regiment, will return to the scene of the war. The
tA&nm last night was profusely Illustrated and was given for the benefit of
the Young Men? Sodality Club.
As already Indicated Father McKlnnon emphatically denied that Amer
ican soldiers had looted or desecrated churches. He asked no one to under
stand him to say that churches had not been looted. He said they had been
desecrated and robbed of their costly vestments and valuable ornaments,
but In every Instance he declared the outrages had been committed by the
Insurgents. Further than this, he said, no falser charge could be made
than to accuse General Funston of having stripped vestments from a statue
to adorn his wife. This charge, the reverend speaker said. Is absolutely
false a? are all Othen with which unscrupulous newspapers seek to malign
and dishonor American soldiers.
Father McKlnnon described General Funston as a brave, liberal-minded
man and a brave general, who was more strict, perhaps, than any other
general of the Eighth Army Corps in regard to the desecration of sacred
places. In conclusion the reverend gentleman paid an eloquent tribute to
the soldlftrs with whom he has served and to whom he has served when
death was to close the scene of the battleiield.
THIEVES TUNNEL
TO A WAREHOUSE
Much Wheat Has Been
Stolen in Stockton.
Er*clal Dispatch to The CalL
STOCKTON. Nov. IS.â The other day a
large tier of wheat In one of the water
front warehouses suddenly collapsed and
upon Investigation it was found that the
warehouse had been undermined from
Stockton channel, and that thieves had
be>en stealing wheat on a .largo . scale.
During the summer and autumn, when so
much wheat Is left upon . the wharves,
there la always BOOM loAs by petty thiev
ing, and It was known that now and then
a sacK or two had been taken, but no one
had any Idea that; such extensive opera
tions were contemplated. â¢â â  : . â¢. . :
The work had been cleverly done. The
warehouse stands back some distance
from the channel and the' thievea â  had
rowed under the wharf and run a tunnel
to the warehouse, and through the brick
foundation of the' building. â  A hole was
then cut in the .floor of the warehouse,
.sacks cut "I" and the grain run down a
chute Into a boat and taken away. It is
not known exactly how much- was taken
In that way, but it must have boon con
siderable. When the sacks collapsed the
tunnel was discovered. The sacks were
replaced and the- matter kept quiet. In
the hope of landing the thieves, but they
did not attempt any more operations. It
Is supposed that they found out that their
work nad been discovered..'. â  â¢ â¢ . ;'..
IN LONDON'S TOWER.
Some Curious and Interesting Discov-
cries Made. ... â¢ ...
The building of the new guard-room In
the inner bailey of the tower of London
has led to a strange and Interesting dis
covery, and enhanced the mystery and
romance which have gatnered for Cen
turies around Its gray walla and battle
ments. The new guard-room occupies
the space between the bloody tower and
the white tower upon tne right as you
enter the Inner ward, and in preparing
Its* foundations a subterranean passage
was uncovered (or, to bo accurate, redis
covered, for Its ex.stence was known be
fore), extending 'from the. moat near the
traitors" gate beneath St. Thomas' tower,
in the direction cf the southwest angle of
the white tower. The passage is lined
throughout with Norman masonry and
has a level lloor. It was evident at once.
therefore, that it was not a drain or cul
vert, for In that Case It would has- had
a rounded bottom; and It became a mat
ter of Interest to follow It both ways,
toward the moat and toward the white
tower, for the purpose of ascertaining
whether it communicated directly with
the Interior of the white tower, forming
thus an outlet to the moat from the lower
portion of the keep where the dungeons
are situated. â¢ -','â .â ..
It seemed most likely that this should
be the case, but expectation has been dis
appoint o<l. The passage â ^indeed, lead
to a dungeon, and a most horrible one,
but there li no communication with the
white tower. It runs straight from, the
moat into the dungeon, but --.the dungeon
is completely -Isolated from all parts of
the fortress, and its* communication with
the upper air Is. by a shaft which do
scends into the passage. .. :.- : ".-â¢ .
â  By permission of the office of works a
representative of. the Dally Graphic was
allowed to descend the shaft and inspect
the passage and, the dungeon under. the
guidance of Mr; 1 May. th.- clerk of â¢ the
works. Arriving at the tower and pre
senting Ms pass at th'- ottce of Mr. May,
that gentleman exhibited to his visi
tor In. the little yard bchit'td his - olllce . the
objects discovered in '.' clearing out the
shaft and passage.' These consist. mainly
of masses of green-giazoiV ware such i<s
waft- common throughout the Middle Ages:
several. broken brown jugs,- Known as ocl-:
iarmlnt's, and pieces of colored delft: and
Fulhcun wart all, no doubt; fragments
of the broken - utensils Â«if the garrison.,
thrown down the : shaft after the dungeon
had .ceased to be used .In Elizabethan
times and later. '. â  . ' .- - : â¢,
More interesting": than those relics; are
numbers of Cannon balls of ston6' and. of.
Iron which Were found in the excavation.
Some of the iron balls have- marks on
them; One has been found marked with
the letter "It." To others pieces of bone
and timber are still adhering. It is 1,.-
lieved,: with great probability, that some
at least of these round shot were li red at
the tower by the Protestant rebels under
Sir Thomas Wvatt. . The "It" mark on
one of the balls may be that of the ar
â enaj at Rochester; to which the rebels
had access' before marching on London. '.'
\v>.itt. as is well known, beaded a re
bellion of Kentish men when the fear
spread that the Spaniards were coming to
conquer the realm after the Queen hail set
her heart oh -thÂ«. marriage with Philip of
Spain. The stirring tale, is briefly told by
ThÂ« ships In the Thames. Bubmltted to
be seized by the insurgents. A party of
the train band.* of .London, .who marched
under the Duke of Norfolk against them.
deserted to thÂ« rebels in â  mass, with
shouts of â¢AAVyatt! a Wyatt! We are all
Englishmen.' Had the Insurgents moved
quickly on- the capital : Its:, gates would
have been flung open and success would
have, been assured. But in the; critical
moment Mary was. saved by her queenly
courage; â¢ Riding boldly- to the Guildhall
Â«he appealed, 'with a man's voice.,' to the
loyalty of the citizens, when \V>att
a;. p. red " or) the South bank the
bridge was secured. Wyatt pushod.on
up the river, crossed at Kingston, turned
back on London and was finally defeated
and inside prisoner, at Temple -Bar. "I'
have .kept touch. . he cried at the- (rate,
but his adherents within were unable to
make, the promised diversion In his favor,
and Wyatt was sent to the tower and be
headed. â¢ â¢â¢; â¢ .â¢ â¢ -. â¢
It seems probable that the cannon balls
now discovered, were tired either by the
ships In the river or from the other side
by the artillery- w:hloh "Wyatt had with
him on- his march. But the tower;-even
on Its most . vulnerable -.side, the . river
front, "was impregnable to any. force of
foot or artillery which WA'att cogld bring
against it. The bones which- adhere to
some of the. cannon shot seem to tell of
.pome execution dnne^-ghastly reltes may
be, of some of the garrison who fell In
the bombardment. .. . â¢ â¢
One. of the most. Interesting finds was a
ma.!<s.of Roman cement in which was- im
bedded three of the well-known tile's with
which the Roman architects handed.- their
walls. The cement Is as Usual, of extreme
hardness. With this were portions of the
flues of hypoeaust and a brnken vessel of
Roman earthenware.. There never wan
. any real doubt that a Roman fortress ex
isted on the site of the tower; tradition
has bven constant to that effect.
The Roman wall of Ix>ndon touched the
rlvef at the point where the tower
stands, the Roman masonry undoubtedly
lies at tlie bass of some of the existing
mediaeval walls. The discovery of inese
Roman remains close to the white tower
is Interesting, as showihg that it was
there probably that one of the principal
dwellings of the Roman garrison stood.
Anotht-r interesting object is the wooden
handle of a dagger of the fifteenth cen
tury, of the type which has a lobe on
each Fide rif the guard.
These relics inspected, the p.issapr* and
dungeon were next visited. Mr. stay's
WorKmen having lighted the Interior with
candles, totne Idea could be formed of Its
size .ml aspect. The bottom of the sub
terrnnenn passage Is seventeen feet be
neath the i. â¢â < \ of the ground, and ti.e
shaft by which access to It Is gained, and
by which, nu doubt, the prisoner who \ as
doomed to suffer In it was lowered, de
sends straight into It.
Toward the moat the passage waa closed
by a strong iron grille firmly imbedded In
the masonry; at its other end Is the dun
geon, :t horrible black cell, oval in shape.
originally vaulted, nnd measuring about
seven feet across. When the opening of
the shaft above was closed no ray of light
could penetrate Into this terrible prison
save that which came â If. Indeed, even
that could romeâ from the opening far
away }n the moat. The exploration of
the passage nas revealed the fact that
another subterranean passage leads Into
it at right angles from the Traitors' Gate,
so that it Is probable that a prisoner
brought Into the tower by water through
that, gate could have been put Into the
passage without setting foot on the
grV)utid. However this may he, n Is cer
tain that no man condemned to the oubli
ette of the t'iwer-f.T MH-h this dungeon
could hay lived long. Tht daraii,
darkness and the rats must have macio
short work of him.â l^ondon Graphic.

EFFECTS OF ACIDS USED
IN PRESERVING BEER
Salicylic Brtards BigeEtion. but No
Bad Effects Have Been Noticed
From Eoracic Acid.
NEW YORK. Nov. -16.â Senator Mason of
Illinois, representing the United States
Senate committee on manufactures, con
tinued his Investigation to-day into the
adulteration of food products. Professor
Kussell H. Chlttenden, prafensor of physl
olnKical chemistry at Yale University. Jl
nvior.of tho Sheffield School of Science,
and president of the American Physiolog
ical Bocit-ty. was the llrst witness. He
testified that salicylic acid, which is used
as a preservative In beer, retards diges
tion.
Itorax has a like effect, but he had
found no deleterious effect from the ust
of boraclc add in small quantities,
though In largo quantities it produces
nausea. Very few of the general food
prcductÃ on the market analyzed by Pro
fessor Chlttenden showed the presence of
antiseptics as preservatives.
The witness said he had analyzed all
sorts of domestic liquors, including beer.
and that the only . adulteration he" had
found was an addition of water In
whisky.
Prompted by Dr. H. "W. Wiley, the
I tilted States chemist. Senator Mason
asked Professor Chlttcnden about all the
food products that other witnesses have
told the commission are adulterated and
the witness declared none of them harm

COFFEE-MAKING A FINE ART.
It Is Easily Acquired, However, by
â¢ â¢ All Housiwives.
"Good coftec olid good blends are neces
sary In all cases where a good cup of eof
; fee Is expected," said a well known chef,
who has for years had â  reputation for
the excellence of the coffee served to his I
customers. "Java gives the best satisfac
tion. The tern 'blend' rÂ«f<is to the dis
trict from which the article comes, not
the grade. Even the best of blends may
at times lose their character by being un
der-roasted or over-roasted. It Is also
true that grinding affects the product.
When the coffee li ground too line or pul
verized a drink is made quicker from It,
perhaps, but It loses its character to some
extent. It Is best to have the bean ground
medium. In this state the deleterious ele
ments are not thrown off as In others,
and the bitter flavor sometimes encoun
tered is not found.
"It is too often' true that the reason
poor coffee Is served in households where
in all other respects the best cooking is
exacted is because the servants are care-
I less and the mistress of the house does
Dot herself know how to brew a cup of
the beverage as it should bo prepared.
To secure the best results in the kitchen
It Is necesnnry for the mistress to teach
the cook the art of making coffee. This
1 can be done by applying the formula
which I u?e. Once learned it Is never for
gotten, and If there Is any variation It
can be detected by the mistress. When
a new I'sill comes the lesson should
l>.< taught over again. Considering the
large amount of the bean that is con
sumed In every household it seems right
that above all else the women of the
land should know how to prepare the
most popular of drinks.
"Take a granite coffee pot, free from
Â»ny abrasion where the Iron may be ex
posed to the coffee. The contact of these
two Is ruinous. This applies to tin pots,
too: In fact, where any metal Is used
and Is exposed to the action of the cof
fee, or where the bottom of the pot or
the surface edges are worn. The vessel
should be a drip pot. Whether it be â 
cloth, china or metal sieve, It la best to
have a drip arrangement. A cloth drip
or bag, or such a percolator ns has a
cloth attachment Is recommend( d.
"It is most essential nt tho start to
have positive knowledge that the water is
not only filtered, but boiling hot. Water
should never be added afterward, once
the coffee has been made. It will not
stand changing.
"Place In the granite saucepan one
heaping tablespoonful of medium-graded
conee for each cup and a half you make.
Pour enough hot water on it and stir with
a spoon until all the coffee has been
moistened. This procedure will take
about one minute, in the meantime thÂ«
pot must be ready to receive this moist
ened coffee, which la poured into the
percolator or bag. To this li added suttl
cient boiling water to make the number
"' cups of coffee to correspond with the
spoonfuls of ground coffee used.
"Alter tii- â¢tfee has drippod into the
pot through thÂ« has. draw the coffee -.Â«â¢
Into another vessel, remove the ltd from
the top of the pot and pour this coffee
through the grounds nn ,j let it cirir.
through again. Continue this at least
three times, allowing it to fuliv drip
through; then set the coffee pot on your
stove, where it is hot enough to have
your â IT.- boll not less than throe min
utes or more than live. After it baa
Dolled, place it in such a position on the
stove that it will keep ready for service,
Better results are obtained by allowing
the coffee to stand in this position at
least half an hour before using it The
percolator or bag should remain In the
po is ill toe tine, and only bo removed
when the pot la sent to the table.
A delicious cup of Vienna coffee can
be obtained and the full strength and
color Insured by pouring sufficient cream
â¢ V? ne bottom of the cup, according to
hni^iJfi taÂ«te. Then fill it up to the
brim with the coffee made after the for
mula given. Place the coffee and cream
together In a granite saucepan and let
the mixture come to a boil, pouring It
back Into the cup at this stage ready
for serving This Vienna coffee is â¦>Â«

Many Upsets in the Sloppy

The slaughter of the favorites con-
Untied at Tunforan. Park yesterday, and
for the time being the bookmaklng fra
ternity appear to bo masters of the sltua*
tlon. The races broke m i nicely for the
layers of odds that even the field books
made money, for a change. Of six choices
sent to the post, Aborigine', a most shaky
one; and Tullnmore were the only ones
to safely navigate the Juicy going.
The menu Contained no notable turf
delicacies, thÂ« seven furlong handicap
alune possessing any pretensions as to
class. There wore seven acceptances,
and It was a most open betting affair.
At post time Silver Tone. with pounds
up, had a slight call over Morlnel, carry
ing Tommy Burns and 102 pounds.
Spencer had the mount on Ostler Joe, the
tup- weight, and the black horse seemed
well thought of, ruling third choice.
When sent away King Carnival, a well
touted one, hurried away In the lead,
which he held for half the distance, fol
lowed by Ostier Joe and Morlnel. Less
than three furlongs from the stand Burns
on the latter mare' made an early move,
quickly followed by Spencer with JoÂ«.
Weight told the last sixteenth and the
blacK fellow under hard urging was
beaten out a length cleverly by Mat
Storn's game. mare. .Silver Tone found
all the wash-outs in the track, and John
son on Potente lost his bearings alto
gether at the stretch turn while taking
aeep water soundings.
A shabby bunch Bturted in the half mile
scramble for two-year-olds. After a zig
zag Journey Thorpe on Aborigine man
aged to down March Seven a length.
St. Agnes, at one time favorite, wan
third.
Thorpe alsÂ«o piloted Pat Murphy over
the mark winner of the live furlong dash
following. Third choice In the ring, the
roan horse under persuasive riding out
gamed Torlbio, the favorite, winning by a
neck. Ricardo, a well-played starter,
took the show.
Forte, with Hullman in the saddle and
favorite for the mile and a furlong run,
at no time seemed afnicted with speed,
finishing third behind Jennie Reed and
Coda. It was only a gallop for the first
named mare, which won all the way.
Reolla was caught by the webbing at the
start, never being prominent.
Billy Randall's patched up sprinter
Tullamore captured the fourth event at
six furlongs. Jack Martin rode him to
perfection, and stalling oft the challenge
of I, da. beat that gelding out a neck,
drawing away. Eddie Joins on Campus
had to be content with third money.
Tommy Hums sat astride the winner of
the afterpiece â Lothian. Montallade, a.
IS to 1 outsider, nearly made a runaway
race of It, leading to within forty yards
of the wire, where Burns and his mount
came up, downing the long shot a head.
Spencer on the even money favorite
Lodestar ran into the show.
Track Notes.
Thirteen book* cut In yesterday.
Barney Schrelber, who was warmly
greeted by his friends, chalked up prices

The Judges suspended Mounce for what
was considered a wenk effort on Reolia,

Charley Thorpe piloted the first two

Charles F. Price, presiding steward at
Oakland track, has wired to the American
Turf Congress nil acceptance of a
place on the license committee. Captain
Reel will retire on the first of the year
In conformity with one of the laws of the
congress.
The plunge on Kay Heath, a starter In
the second event, began In the hand
books the night fore. The mare was
touted at "'it as â  "moral," her odds he
lm: hammered down from 15. At the
track sho opened at 6 and was backed to
13 to 5. Hullman was away badly and the
good thing never had a chance.
In some Instances Mr. t'aldwell Is In
altogether too much of a delay to dis
patch his fields. The public do not fancy
rielnys. but would like to get a run when
coin Is heavily Invested. Tanoka. well !
backed to win the opening scramble, was '
not given a chance to get up to the bar

After dismounting from the back of
Forte, liullman was taken Pick and his
Other mounts were canceled. He has i
heart trouble.
Little Jack Martin Is rapidly becoming
as big .1 favorite an Johnny Relff, and Is j
no doubt a better rider than that promis
ing youth. He can kick 'em nearly as
hard as Hullman. sit Mill as long as
Spencer, handle th*> bat like a Slmms and
finish the same as a Garrison. This may
of course, be drawing It a little broad

D AN HALIFAX
A SURPRISE
The California took no chances In book
ing "What Happened to Jones." The
management knew the play, the player
and the combination. The whole affair
Is as smoothly professional as Broadhum
and Harry Corson Clarke, which is very
much so Indeed. The gaunt, square
shouldered comedian of the Yankee
shrewd eyes is exactly what he was of
oldâ not one whit more or less. He never
lags In his rattling par,.; he never rises
to brilliancy. He has always a fund of
wholesome humor to draw from. it is
cold, clean, shiny humorâ a neat varnish
on the surface of things.
" The surprise of the play is Daniel Hall
fax as Richard Heatherly. Mr. Halifax
has been a pleasant member of the Al
cazar company, and so far so pood. But
he barely hinted at what was coming.
His new environment had a startling ef
fect. It drew the cork of the champaign.
âa champagne full of quivering lights
and shifting colors. Mr. Halifax is of a
positive temperament; high strung, en
thusiastic. Hitherto wo have known him
merely as a young gentleman who could
wear a dress suit without bidding for a
tip. That fact alone made him something
of a rarity on the stage. In his part of
Richard his spirits nave risen like a colt's
In new meadows, and his little scene with
the old professor, where he coaxes, urges
and finally bears him away to the prize
tight, Is the gem of the tlrst art.
Miss Laura Crews Is another young San
Franciscan who Is blossoming. "She Is
very pretty," said the gentlemen In the
loge at the end of act I. "She Is a good
actress," they added after act 11. "ThÂ«
best woman In the cast," at the evening's
close.
The much advertised Miss Banning
plays her old maid part In a common
place way. The professor, an excellent
opportunity, fails to score, although flaw
leas. More faults and more merits might
win where dull faultlessness passes un
noticed. Wherein lies a nice little moral
for him who a moralizing would go.

JV\7AE. BISHOP PROVES
J\ SIFTED VCOLIST
Owing to the Inclement weather there
was not as large an audience at Sherman
& Clay Hull last evening as Mme. Gen
evra Johnstone litshop deserved. Mint.
Bishop possesses a natural dramatic
soprano of much forceâ voice which
.-â¢ am created for the grander composi
tion, and it must be a veritable treat to
listen to her in oratorio recitals. This
came specially Into evidence while she
rendered Gounod's "Jerusalem," wher*
the fervor of the composition demanded
Ju>t a voice of such strength as that of
lime. Bishop.
Surely this able artiste, with her mag
in:. i nit soprano and tine presence, should
never fall to gain enthusiastic applause
from an admiring public. The Baa Fran
cisco Philharmonic orchestra played some
â elections and also the accompaniment to
th. soloist. An orchestra of this Kind
should not attempt to play accompani
ments for an accomplished singer, ft In
Impossible that such short experience as
that of the Philharmonic can achieve sat
isfactory results In accompaniment They

Mr. Howe may risk bringing them out
but as matters stand now this sort of
thing Will never do. There Is considerable
vim and dash to be observed and the
strings and wood wind are good. : The
brass, however, needs a little Improve

few violin solos excellently, and Mrs. \V.

Apropos of the proponed "Anglo-Ameri
can alliance.' in.- story of Horace Gree
ley's neat rebuke of the Englishman who
once acreed with him too literally may
be worth telling. Mr. Greeley was dJS
cussinK in a â¢ leral company the faults
and in eds of i v own nation.
"What this country needs," said he, in
his piping roll I and Yankee accent. "Is
a real good licking."
It happened that there was an English
man present, and he promptly said, with
unmistakable English accent:
"Quite riKht. Mr. Qrefley; quite right.
Th- country needs a 'licking.' ''
But Mr. Greeley, without glancing In
the Englishman's direction, or seeming
to pay any attention to the Interruption,
went on In the same squeaky tone:
"Hut the truth Is. there Is no .nation
that can Rive It to us."â Youth's Compan

THE SAN FKA>" CISCO CALL, FRIDAY. NOVEMBER 17, 1899.
FRAGLEY COULD
SEE PROFIT IN
A BAD DECISION
A Little Graft That
Did Not Work.
HEAVY ASSESSMENT ORDERED
HARD WINTER AHEAD OF THE
STREET DEPARTMENT.
Superintendent Said He Would Carry
Charter Case Up, but the
Clerks Would Not Put
Up the Stuff.
Notwithstanding early rains and every
assurance of abundant feed there are
evidences that the grass is getting short
in the. Street D paftment. In fact, it is
said that Farmer Fra^ley, who conducts
that end of the municipal ranch, has
been : similarly troubled Hint- and Again
during his administration' and on each
occasion has. tided over by appealing for
assistance on one plea or another to his
over-generous help. That his employes
have each lime responded is a matter of
City Hall history and general knowledge.
They, could not well do otherwise con
sidering jobs were scarce with plenty of
takers.
â  On this latest occasion, however, It
looks as though Fragley were up against
the real thing. At other times when the
word baa (one duwn the line be has had
hm littie without a murmur, but that w.us
before the Supreme Court charter decis
lon knocked him out ot office and reduced
his hiring â¢capacity to .111 unproiitablu
minimum. Twenty-live, per cent or even
â more; of a month's salary was a mere
noihiuK if it assured the well-touched
deputy of the balance.. Where Fragley
B<ji on' wmng, according to three or tour
of his deputies, won in trying to mako
money. on his adverse decision.
Not many days after that had been
handed down he made boml-onicial an
nouncement that he would carry his case
on up to the i uited States Supreme Court.
He was particular to inform his deputies
of his Intention and, through hie lieuten
ant lit the department, spread before them
glowing pictures of the absolute certainty
of success and also gave them assurances
that : they would be retained in cilice
"when the old man wins out." Even If
he old not win, was argued, the char
ter, could not go into effect until a de
cision was handed down and no one could
say how long that would be. Fragley
handed these packages out for the belter
part of a fortnight, but made them m
strong that the old hands lost Interest in
everything else and waited only for the
inevitable touch.
According to one of the Superintend
ent's well-Known clerks it came In the
shape of a suggestion that as the. "old
man" was to carry his case up In the In
terests of all every one should share In
the expense. "That kind of graft worked
bet'orr, but we were waiting for It this
time," said The Call's informant yester
day. "We had been given to understand
that when we didn't -come to the front
we could begin working on our resigna
tions, and we generally anted, but when
It came this time wo wouldn't stand for
it. It was too near the end of the year
and the end of the otlice, so we passed
the old man up like a white chip and
you .n't hear yourself think out there
now- for the roar that is Inc up. I
don't think he would have carried the
case up. anyway." Despite hard times,
however, Fragley Insists that he will not
give up his ollice md he will probably
dfcllne to turn over his books at the end
of the yÂ«-ar.
NIPPON MARU'S FOURTH

tine .:!.' â  r. Dr. Matheson, that death was
not caused by some infectious disease.
The steamer arrived Inside the heads
shortly after 1 o'clock, but It was not
until â¢> o'clock p. m. that Dr. Matheson
bad convinced himself that Ishikawa died
of heart failure. The Marti was then al
lowed to proofed to the Pacltlc Mail dock,

entire voyage boJng twenty-eight days,
twelve, hours and twenty-six minutes.
Pleasant weather prevailed during thÂ«
whole trip and the only Incident that oc
curred to mar the pleasure of the voy
age was the untimely death of the Japan

cabin and eighty steerage passengers, the

THE PATHETIC HUMORISTS.
Howard Malcolm Ticknor Dellg-hts
Large Audience With Touch
ing Extracts From Humor
ous Authors.
The last but ono of Malcolm Tlcknor's
readings was given by him at the First
Unitarian Church. Frnnklln ami Geary
streets, yesterday afternoon. The lec
turer took for his subject "The Pathetic
Humorists." In his Introduction he In
stanced "David Harum" as one of the
most pathetic (to those who read be
tween the lines) books ever written.' "It
represents tho Hgonlzlng effort of a man
who Is strusEllmj against sickness, who
knows that bin death warrant Is signed,
to hide his mental torture under the mask
of comedy. And so In many of the ureat
humorists there Is a vein of sadness, of
pathos, all the more beautiful and touch-
In? for Its unexpectedness." Mr. Ticknor
Illustrated this fact with extracts, grave
and Kay, from John O. Saxe,
who he said was once the equal
of Holmes; from Barrle, and from
Lamb, whose humorous essaya the
speaker contrasted with his terrible "Con
fessions of a Drunknrd." Bret Harte, he
was inclined to think, had fallen off since
the days when he wrote of the life of
Jolm Oakhurst, Rambler, whose career, as
told by Harte, embraced many episodes
far more traffic than death Itself. Field's
humor was well Illustrated by the story
of his suppressed book. "Culture's Gar
land," In which an essay appeared on
"Hamlet." In which photos of tho legs of
the various enactors of the role served
K8 Illustrations, and the essaylsl treated
the. subject as though the essence of the
part lay below the equator. During the
reading of "Little Boy Blue" many fur
tive handkerchiefs bore witness to the
reader's skill In rendering the pathetic
little poem. At the opening of the lec
ture Mr. Ticknor contradicted the story
In an Oakland paper to the effect that he
had stated that "an actor and actress
separated by their professional duties had
a right to live their own lives Irrespective
of convention." and said It was a gratu
itous misconstruction. The lecturer
speaking of the separation of Julia Mar
lowÂ© and her husband, had said that
"though to be regretted from a social
point of view, a professional couple were
justified in severing their conjugal rela
tions In order to fulfill their professional
engagements." Next Thursday Mr. Tick*
nor will apeak of "Shakespeare as a Dra
matic Constructor." Miss Katherlne
Oliver, well known to local people by her
Scotch and Irish readings, will on Mon
day afternoon recite scenea from tne
"Little Mlnietor" In the parlors of the
church. ...-

DEATH OF CAPTAIN
HENRY INVESTIGATED
SWEPT FROM THE POOP DECK
BY A WAVE. ' '
Seamen Spun Their Yarns at the In
quest Yesterday and Told of
Blood on the Carpenter's
Hammer. ' . .
Sailors* yarn* were spun yesterday In
I Coroner Hlll\s ofiiee with the usual salt
I sea elaboration by the bronzed tars who
i came to this port on the 111-fat ship
! Cyrus Wakefleld, whoso master, Captain
]F. T. Henry, was killed while gong
around the Horn.
The Coroner was holding an Inquest to
determine the cause of death. It having
been generally rumored among the crew
i that ho had been the victim of foul play.
I The person hinted at in these rumors Is
j First Mate Frederick Wllllajn&on, now on
j his way to this city by rail to vindicate
I his reputation from the charge or inslnua
! tion, whatever it may be termed. Mr.
Williamson has begun suit in a New
I York court against the Associated Preai
for libel in having published rumors con
! necting him with the death of the cap
tain.
All the witnesses agreed on the follow
ing state of facts: At 7 o'clock on tho
evening of June 14 of this year, while the
i ship was rounding Cape Horn, a heavy
pea truck the vessel and caused her to
lurch heavily. Members of the crew on
' deck were swept from their feet and
! washed from bulwark to bulwark until
I they were dashed against something of
which they could take hold. Among the
t persons being tossed by the sea around
! the deck was Captain T. F. Henry. Sailor
â  Frank rUllow, who seemed to be an
: honest and truthful witness, had been at
I work on the pumps and was caught in
I the big wave and swept from one part of
! the dock to the other.
While holding on to a part of the rig
; King he saw a black object which looked
like the form of a man whirling past him
!In the water. He waited until it returned
I with the next roll of the ship and caught
j hold of It. thinking that It was the dead
body of Sailor Grant, who had he,-:: swept
away with him from the pumps. It proved
however, to be the unconscious body of
the captain. â¢ â¢ -
Billow raised an alarm after tho ship
had been righted, the whole affair occupy
ing probably half a minute, and the mate.
Fred Williamson, who was below at the
time, called up through the companion
way to put the body on the poop deck.
Th* unconscious form of the captain was
taken down to the cabin, where the mate
forced some whiskey down the throat of
the injured man. The captain died shortly
afterward. There was a crescent shaped
mark on the back of the head, Just below
the neck, looking like the mark of a ham
mer.
The hammer formed an important
feature of the testimony. According to
two witnesses. Thomas Vlalga, the Fili
pino steward, and Fremont wash, the ap
prentice boy. the mate had borrowed tho
hammer from Carpenter C. J. Carlesoen
before the wave struck the ship, his ob
ject, as stated by him. being to nail up
the shutter of his cabin to keep out the
water. When the witnesses saw the ham
mer the next morning there was blood I
upon the ton of It.
All the witnesses agreed that the mato
was not on deck twenty minutes before
the wave struck the ship. They said fur
ther that the captain was popular and the
mate very unpopular. Captain Johnson :
the second officer of the ship, thought
that the f.iptnln was killed by the sea
dashing him against some part' of tho
deck, the deceased being on tho elevated
poop deck nt the time the bin wave came I
lie paid also that the captain and Mate
Williamson quarreled frequently and had
hot "words, hut never came to blows. The
mate, he paid, wanted to sew the body In 'â 
a pack and throw It overboard, but the
Witness and the remainder of the crew â¢
would not allow that disposition to be
made of the body.
An autopsy will be made to-day and
the Jury will be summoned to hear th<^
result and to deliberate upon" their
verdict.-' â¢

SUIT FOR SALVAGE.
Property Valued at f470,000 Al-
leged to Have Been Salved.
P. C. Harrison and Alexander McGee
filed in the United States District Court
yesterday a suit for salvage against the
Alaska Commercial Company. The com
plaint recites that on August 1 of this
year the defendants steamer Louise left
St. Michael, Alaska, en route to Juneau,
with three barges In tow laden with
canned provisions, boots, shoes and cloth
ing, and that within twelve hours there
after a heavy storm arose and the barges
wore cut loose from the steamer, which
had sprung a leak and was stranded on
the Island of. St. Michael. One of the
barges was sunk by the violence of the
storm and â  part of Its cargo was cast
ashore. Most of this cargo as well as the
two other barges with their cargoes were
saved by the hi. .hints. - -V
After the barges and the cargoes had
been in possession of the libelants for two
clays thirty employes of the defendant
forcibly seised and carried away tho
barees and their cargoes without giving
the libelants any compensation whatever.
The libelants ask for salvage, and fix
the value of the two barges at $10,000 each
and the value of the cargoes of the three
barges at $430 .000: â 
Plasterers Protest.
At a reo.nt meeting of the Plasterers"
I Union held in this city a set of resolu
tions was adopted protesting against cer
tain statements made. by Smith Brothers
regarding the plaster of the Marine Hos
pital at Mare Island. Smith Brothers
made the complaint that the material
used in the work was not pood, for It Is
already in need of extensive repairs, and
the hospital has only Ju.= t been finished.
The plasterers answer. that the material
is the same that is proving satisfactory
hero In San Francisco, and that the
trouble lies â¢ In â¢ the fact , that Smith
Brothers employed unskilled workmen.
They will send a copy of tlfelr resolutions
to the Secretary of the Navy.

THE CALL'S
HOME STUDY CIRCLE
BENJAMIN FRANKLIN BY DR. SMITH OF YALE.
Copyright, 1890, by Seymour Eaton.
OREAX A/V\EHICÂ£\IN STATES/WEN.
V. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN.
Benjamin Franklin was the fifteenth J
child of â  New England family of seven- |
teen children. He was born In Boston in I
1703. and when 10 years old assisted his }
father at his trade of a tallow chandler j
and soap boiler. At the age of 13 he was
apprenticed to his brother and learned i
from him tho trmle of a printer. Four [
years later he went to Philadelphia; where i
hi.M Intelligence and skill soon brought mm ,
Into notice. Following the urgent advice
of the .Governor of Pennsylvania, he went
to London) where he remained a year and
a half. But no more promising openlr.j?
appeared for him there than that of a
teacher of a swlmmlng school, which he
was urged by an influential friend to ac- i
BENJAMIN FRAM<LIN.
eept. Fortunately he hart higher Id.-nls
fnr a Ilf'- work, so he returned to Phila
delphia in 1726. Here he settled m â  print
er, married and lived for nearly thirty
y*ars before making his first long sojourn
abroad.
It was during these years that lie dis
played those qualities and achieved those
results â¢'.which -have given him an ac
knowledged place among the wisest of
mankind and the benefactors of th- rare.
In his business affairs he was shrewd and
far-sighted and prospered, first In the con
duct of his printing office, then as pdltor
and publisher of the Pennsylvania Ga
zette. In the latter he Introduced the
novel feature of advertisements, and â¢Â«<>.
as Parton says, "originated the modern
system of advertising." While always
thrifty, and with a keen eye for the profit
of an enterprise, he was never forgetful
of the higher utilities, and evidently val
ued his personal successes for the oppor
tunities they brought him to be useful to
others. The ruling motive of his 111 *vas
to benefit mankind, and to this his efforts
were chiefly directed.
As a conspicuous illustration of this
should be mentioned his publication of
"Poor Richard's Almanac." This hi com
menced in 1722 and continued for about
twenty-five years. The distinguishing
feature of It was the collection of short,
pithy maxims which each number con
tained, and which were Intended to com
mend the homely virtues, such si Indus
try, sobriety and economy. A few speci
mens will show their flavor. "Tongue
double brings trouble." "He that drinks
fast pays slow." "Would you live with
case, do what you cught and not what
you please." "No man yet was glorious
who was not laborious." "Three may
keep a secret if two of them are dead."
"Early to bed and e,arly to rise, makes
a man healthy, wealthy and wise." "Dil
igence Is the mother of good luck." "God
helps them that help themselves." "None
preaches better than the ant, and she
aays nothing." "The noblest question in
the world Is. What good can I do In it?"
."Oh, lazy-bones! Dost thou think God
would have given the.- arms and legs If he
had not designed thou pbouldsi use
them?" "An empty bag cannot stand up
right." "Well done Is twice done." "Trie
sleeping fox catches no poultry. Up! Up!"
"Keep thou from the opportunity, and
God will keep thee from the Â»in." . "lie
ware of little expenses: a small leak will
sink a great ship. Tls easier to pre
vent bad habits than to break them."
"rtllks and satins put out the kitchen
fire." "A plowman on his legs Is hlgner
than a gentleman on his knees." "Haute
makes waste." "Virtue and a trade are
a child's best portion." "Content Is the
philosopher's stone that turns all It touch
es Into gold."
Concerning this famous almanac, Morse
In his life of Franklin says:
The publication ranks as one of the most In
fluential In the world. Its "proverbial sen
tences, chiefly such as Inculcated Industry and
frugality as the means of procuring wealth
and thereby securing virtu*." were sown like
seed all over the land. The almanac went
year after year, for a quarter of a century. Into
the houses of nearly every shopkeeper, planter
and fanner In thÂ« American provinces. Its
wit and humor. Its practical tone. Its shrewd
maxim*. Its worldly honesty. Its morality of
common e*nse, Us useful Information, all
chimed well with the national character. It
formulated in homely phrase and with droll
Illustration what the colonists more vaguely
knew, felt and believed, upon a thousand
points of life and conduct. In so doing it
greatly trained and Invigorated the natural
mental traits of the people. "Poor Richard"
was the, revered and popular schoolmaster of
a young nation during Its period of tutelage.
His teachings are among the powerful forces
which have gone to shaping the habit* of
. Americans.
It was not la the giving of good advlco
only that Franklin sought to benefit his
fellow men, for his busy brain was ever
suggesting: practical devices for increas
ing the comfort of Ufa or widening its
outlook. One of his best known Inven
tions was the stove which bears his name,
which was a great improvement on the
open fireplace. On this he refused to take
out a patent, considering that whatever
advantage might come to the public from
Its use was only part recompense for the
many benefits conferred by society upon
him. He devised and established the firm
circulating library. He founded an acad
emy which later became the University
of Pennsylvania. He reorganized the tire
department of Philadelphia, with the re
sult that loss by fire was greatly dimin
ished. As Postmaster he made the post
office far more efficient than It had ever
seen before. He interested himself deeply
In scientific problems of various kinds,
bringing to bear upon them the penetra
tion of his keen, ongnlal mind. His most
famous discovery was made when he es
tablished the identity of atmospheric elec
tricity with that obtained artificially In
the laboratory- The kite which brought
down lightning from the skies raised him
in the sight of all the world to a place
among the great scientific lights of the
age, so that when he went to Europe he
was a famous man and the best known
of living Americans. - : /.â¢Â« :.-.*
The first of his two most important
missions abroad was In 17C4. That year
opened a period momentous In the history
of our country. The French and Indian
war had been fought, and had ended with
the expulsion of the French from the
North American continent. The peace of
Paris had closed one war. but it prepared
the way for another, for It left the. British
Government free to turn Its attention to
the colonies as n source of revenue and
at the same time made theÂ£colonles lesm
than ever/willing to submit to external
control. Franklin was now 58 rears. old
and the most Important part of his nubile
life was still before him.
The coming storm Df the revolution was
not for the moment seen, and Franklin
went, to England as the agent of Penn
sylvania to look after her Interests In a
contest with the proprietor. He expected
to return In a few months, but startling
events jioon came, .completely over
shadowing 'he original object of his mla
slon. and keeping him several years at a
post which hail grown to be one of na
tional Importance. Flmt came the stamp
act, and :n connection with It Franklin
made one of the first blunders of his life.
Me mistook th. eourite of public opinion
in the colonies, believing that they would
sulimlt to *he tax. and accordingly recom
nw-ndeil a person for appointment as sell
er of the stamps In Philadelphia. Great
was the math Â».f his cnuntrymen. who
were led to believe that he had approved
the tax and had even advised It. But ho
had from the first protested against It.
and continued to point out the dangers
of the course which the Government wa s
taking. As h!s true attitude became bet
ter known his popularity returned.
One of -.he conspicuous Incidents of tho
stamp-act controversy was the examina
tion of Franklin nt
the bar of thu
House of Commons.
Friends and foe:*
alike plied him with
questions concerning
the resources of tho
colonies, their attt
tuile toward th-i
mother country,
their pro bab 1 a
course If Parliament
continued to tax
them. Never did
Franklin show mini
plainly his wealth
of information, hi*
mastery of claar
ptatement. his tact,
and kÂ«enness. Burka
â¢Hi. l <>? the proceed-
In? that It was liko
"an examination of
a master by. a par
cel of schoolboys."
An English peri
odical said: "From
thla examination of
Dr. Franklin tha
reader may form a
clearer and more
comprehensive Idea
of the state and dis
position of America,
Â« f the expediency or
inexpediency of tho
measure In question,
and of the character
and conduct of thÂ»
Minister who pre-
pared It, than from all that ha* been
written upon the subject In newspa
pers and pamphlets, under the titles of
essays, letters, speeches and considera
tions, from the first moment of its be
coming the subject of public attention
until now."
The repeal of the stamp act, which fol
lowed, was believed in America to bo
largely the result of Franklin's efforts, so
that his popularity was greatly Increased.
During the yrurs that immediately fol
lowed the repeal he was appointed agent
In England for New Jersey. Georgia and
Massachusetts, so that he represented at
the same time four colonies, two of them
of th. tlrst importance. These appoint
ment!", his thorough acquaintance with
colonial affairs and his great personal
Â£! him to be regarded In
ngland as the representative of all
America. He continued to labor for a
friendly adjustment of difficulties on a
basis satisfactory to the colonies until It
bÂ«came evident. In 1774. that no such set
tlement was possible. Then he returned
to Philadelphia, after an absence of ten
year*.
Events followed each other In rapid suc
cession, culminating In the declaration of
liulf i-endence In lTTtj. Franklin waa now
7') years old. and might well have claimed
exemption from further service. Hut tho
new nation needed her greatest and wid
est citizen to represent her at the friend
ly court of Louis XVI. Franklin cheer
fully undertook the tusk, and so entered
upon what proved to be the most dim
cult and perplexing period of his life.
i he Importance of his mission was clearly
seen. Lord Rocklngh declfr*d that
"the presence of Franklin In Paris much
more than offset the victory of the Eng
lish on Long Island and the capture of
New York." The people of Paris wcro
greatly moved by the arrival of this ven
erable man, whom they knew by reputa
tion as one of the world's sages, ana fol
lowed him about with reverent admira
tion, much as if Solon or Socrates had
suddenly appeared In their midst. Frank
lin shrewdly made the most of this and
turned It all to account for helping his
country's cause. For nine years he re-*
malned In France, doing a work therÂ«
which In Importance was little If at all
behind that of Washington himself In
bringing the revolution to a successful
Issue.
Among the greatest difficulties of tha
war were the lack of money and of credit
by which money could be obtained.
France was well disposed, but what se
curity could the young and struggling
nation give for loans? At this junctura
Franklin's tact and persuasiveness, hli
personal prestige and the confidence ha
Inspired actually supplied the place of
credit and drew forth those generous sup
plies of money which were essential to
the prosecution of the war. This con
stitutes Franklin's unique contribution tr*
the success of the American cause, for wo
must believe that a task which even ho
accomplished with dlfSlculty would have
been Impossible for any one else. Of thÂ»
constant harassment to which he was
subjected by the Jealousy of colleague*
and the Inconsiderate demands of Con
gress them Is not room here to speak.
Relief came In 1753, when the, treaty of
peace was signed, and two years later
he was permitted to return home.
Surely now the arel man would be al
lowed his well-earned rest. But his fel
low-cltlzens could not yet deny themselves
the benefit of his services. lie was elect
ed chief executive of Pennsylvania, and In
1757 was sent as a delegate to the conven
tion which gave us our constitution. Ho
was the Nestor of that famous body, but
aside from exerting his Influence for har
mony took little part in Its proceedings.
His work was done, yet he lived until ltV>
long enough to see the establishment of
firm government under Washington In tho
country he loved so well and to whoso
welfare he had devoted the best energies
of his long and wonderful life.

claimed, he had misrepresented matters
financially when he married her. Practic

Commissioners, and Brown took the stand
and frankly admitted that he had fre
quently borrowed money without any idea
as to how he was ever going- to pay it
back: also that he had been in the habit
of making worthless checks.
Judge Hall intimated that the purpose
of having a guardian appointed might be
a ruse b* which Brown hopM to avoid ar

false pretenses: and he refused to issue
letters of guardianship until some exp* rt
testimony as to Brown's lncompetency

After going East Mr. Bra^efleld gave up anti-saloon w ; ork and accepted

actively engaged in, the healer'a work. X; ; '.â .â¢'
Th. unpleasant reputation that DowieWt behind hi] in Oakland and thÂ«Â»

hands â¢ and order the City Council, as.
Mayor, of the city, and command- City
Attorney Dow. likewise as Mayor, to Im
mediately bring a suit to determine the
legality of the action' of. the ex-Auditor.
It was expected that Mr. Snow- would
have administered a coup to his political
opponents and have, appeared armed with
the .fcecessary resolutions to immediately
carry out his : dictation. That he did not
do so.but adi'pcated. delay and In a meas
ure temporized, was a- great. disappoint

aiders, he 1- Justified in -changing his mind
ahd" In demonstrating the truth of his
statement that he was entitled to .every

HER ABSENCE
INDUCED JURY
TO DISAGREE
Attorneys Dispute as
to Gallantry.
Oak: - run,
â 
Harry Jurgens. who sold a (lass of beer
to a lady In the Watts Tract, and who
was arrested because he did not have a
license, was discharged to-day because
the Jury could not understand why the
lady In the case was not put on the
stand. The lady Is the wife of Tom Ma
rine. License Collector Maloon's deputy.
The defendant Is a German, and the dep
uty, having a wife who can talk Ger
man fluently, concluded it would bÂ« a
good piece of work to take her to Jur
gena' saloon and lay the foundation for
an arrest. The beer was brought, the
lady drank "and paid for It. but was not
put on the witness-stand.
The propriety of putting a lady on th*
stand In a llqucr case caused a bitter ar
gument between Prosecuting Attorney
Beach and Attorney Tom Oarrlty. Gar
rlty repeated many times the statement
that the. absence of the lady was & con
fession of weakness en the part of thÂ»
prosecution and also cast many slurs on
a license Inspector who would resort to
such v means to catch a poor old man
selling 1') cents' worth of root beer with
out a license. Again and again did Qar
rlty demand that the woman be produced
or the old man released.
Prosecutor Leach, the Beau Brummel
of the Alameda har., warmly came to thÂ«
defense of the lady. He charged Mr.
Garrltywlth lack of gallantry and chiv
alry and. extraordinary bad taste la even
hinting that a man's wife who had merely
helped her husband In his lawful bust
ness should be dragged into a policÂ«
court and made to tell of purchasing and
drinking that glass of beer in the Watts
Tract a month ago. Mr. Garrlty and Mr.
Leach exchanged many left-handed com
pliments over the delicate question, and
finally the Jury's sympathies were with
Mr. Oarrlty to ti;*Â» extent of tÂ»n to two.
for they d}sa?reÂ«>d and were discharged,
while it !s hardly likely that Jurgens
will have.anoxnor trlaL
EARRINGS IN FAVOR.
History of the Pretty Baubles Sinco
Ancient Timer
There -are Indications that earrings are
about to ,cbmÂ»Â» Into favor once more a*
articles of feminine adornment.
'â  Periodically the susceptibilities of our
prim public opinion In this country ar<Â»
sorely. shocked at the vulgarity and bru
tality of wearing: Jewelry In the ear. Yet
the practice 19 of great antiquity, anil
rccur9 'with qnlte remarkable regularity.
Its manifestations generally lllustrattr.s
the dominant artistic note of th day.
Jacob gave Rachel an earring of half a
shekel, or nearly half an ounce In weight,
and In th* 1 days of the prophtt Isaiah ear
rings were a prominent characteristic of
feminine ornamentation. Among many
Eastern nations earring."" were worn by
men Â«s well as women, and In our own
land the ornament was the common char*.
actertstlc of both n-?xes In Elizabethan
times, and even later M. Salzmann dis
covered Phoenician earrings li the ruins
of Camyrus. on the island of Rhodes,
which he attributed to the eighth century
before Christ. These are not funeral Jew
el*, such as were commonly made to or
nament the features of the dead. They
are of fine gold, with delicately embossed
work, and tassels of exquisite delicacy.
The Egyptians, history tHls us. used
Jewell primarily as symbols of spiritual
things, and the richer classes used gold
'Sometimes stuck up Into small figure*
with an economy of material rivaling th>j
skill of Birmingham."
In its gradual evolution the earring
?aÂ»se<] through many and curious phase*,
"requently It claimed closa friendship
with the nosering, to which appendage,
revolting as It Is to our conceptions, much
tender romance has ere now dune. Ar
vleux. who was sent by Louis XIV to>
make observations of the custom of tho
Arabs, recorded that It wan â  piece- of
gallantry among the natives to kiss their
wives through the rings hanging from
their nostrils, which rinre werÂ« some
timv* large enough to admit the whot* â 
mouth. â  Under the voluptuous reign of
Rom"? earrings and other personal Jewelry
were Indulged In to satiety, and the orgyo
culminated In a Queen swallowing a pearl
valued at â¢f25.(W in a contest of extrava
gance with a Roman noble.
Turning to "thÂ» spacious days of great
Elizabeth." we -find. It rioord-d that her
Majesty outshone, all rivals of other lan<ls
Int. magnificence. Ony historian describes
her wearing In her ears "two pearls with
drops"; another .and more Impressionable
writer details how. that "diamond stnlac
tltca- gflttered from her: ears." And so

DIVINATION
BY RAILROADS
Give Rebates to Secure
Protection.
â  â¦
Special Dispatch to The CalL
CHICAGO, Nov. 16.â Evidence of rebates
granted by certain roads to favored par
ties was offered before the transportation
sub-commission of the United States In
dustrial Commission to-day. H. E. Dous
man. a retired member of the Board of
Trade, was the principal witness of the
morning.
Host of his testimony referred to the
discrimination of railroad and elevator
combinations against private individuals
who are trying to carry on business, but
are deterred by the action of the concerns
1 rum which they refuse to accept rebates.
Tho witness also gave lt as his opinion
that the principal effect of the Interstate
Commerce Commission has been to put
valuable favors in the hands of fewer
persons than before Its passage and he
explained this broad statement by saying
that the railroads now feel it necessary
to give rebates to persons to whom they
can look for protection.
A. A. Kennard of the Butter and Egg
Board, who testified at the afternoon ses
sion, said there was much complaint
among commission men because of bur
densome rates by telegraph and telephone
companies. He said the general feeling
among commission merchants was in fa
vor of Government control of the tele
graph and telephone. Mr. Kennard also
cited Instances of discrimination in the
distribution of cars for shipping- fruits
from California to Chicago, He claimed
small tirms and private individuals had
frequently to pay a heavy bonus to secure
cars and said live firms In this city prac
tically had control of the refrigerator
cars.
B. H. Greely of the Chicago Board of
Trade testified during the afternoon. He
announced himself In favor of Govern
ment ownership of railroads.
FRENCH POLITENESS
That Could Not Be Ruffled Under
Trying Circumstances.
The car was crowded with a typical lot
of 11 o'clock passengers. It was tha one
warm evening which the weather man
had sandwiched In between his showers
ami frosts. It was rather close Inside
and the young man, who looked as
though he might have been working
overtime checking stock at tha stl*c
counter, had yawned two or three times
and been promptly followed in kind by
all the passengers within Bight of him.
The ventilators were open: so was Iho
rear door, through which the conductor
monotonously called the streets.
"Congress!"
A in. tfÂ»c seven people who climbed
aboard at this stop were two men with
opera coats and crush hats. They had
been makin? adieus at a' carriage door
an the- car cune up. They stepped lnslda
and half unconsciously obeyed the re
quest to "move up front, -please," uiÂ»tll ,
at Harrison .--!r.'<.-t they found them
selves just In front of the stove.
One of them appeared to be a visitor to
the city. The younger man, who called
htm -iinclc," â wng HJiytng unmn very
initiated things about the performance
Just witnessed to which the older man
responded with a decided Parisian ac
cent. Before many minutes they had M
cured the attention of almost the entire
car and were earnestly discussing the out
look for the coming opera season, com
menting upon the Wagnerlan virtues of
the lamented Klafsky, whenasudden lurch
threw the older man violently forward.
He pressed his equilibrium and his good
nature pr#r.-ftilly, and when the car
stopped at Michigan avenue and Twenty-
Eecond street a lady and gentleman
alighted from the rear platform, leaving
a vacant seat. Observing this the young
man urged his companion to be seated.
"Non, non; I am not \veariÂ«'e, " and as
be cast a quick glance around to see If
any ladies were standing, he added with
an emphasis on "some one," "Let some
one occupy ze place."
His manner and speech were no easy
and deferential that the eyes of every
woman In the car were cast admiringly
upon him an the men regarded his vi
cinity with something like curiosity in
their faces.
However, the seat was destined to be
occupied and by a personage upon whom
no one bad counted. A bulky colored
woman bearing: a basket which smelled
suggestively of cold victuals had entered
from the front platform, where she had
evidently been standing at the tit: tho
two fares pot out at Michigan avenue.
She wore Immense soft soled felt shoes
and stepped In noiselessly Just as the
young man asked the elder to be seated.
Although the latter had not seen. her at
all the tlamo took his courteous remark
to herself as she rolled Into the seat and
ejaculated:
"Lands 8.-ike. honey, but I"mÂ» obleeiced
to vehl it â¢Â« easy seetn' you dohn't stick
no hogs nor welch In at de stocky&'ds "
At sound of the voice and feeling the
nudge the woman gave him. the gentlo- i
man turn..!, taking In the situation at a
glance. Dotting his hat very gravely, ho
replied in a most polite tone that was
evidently Bincere:
"Ah. madameâ non, I have not zat
honeur." â Chicago Chronicle.

Destructive to Young Lobsters.
That cod eat younp lobsters Is a fact
established to the satisfaction of a writer
in an exchange. He says: "The codfish
are feeding on the young lobsters to such
an extent that it will not take lon* to ex
terminate them. Through the efforts of
the United States Fish Commission cod
fish stem to ha.ye Increased greatly in
numbers. The fishermen around block
Island and Watch Hill say that cod are
growing more plentiful every year, and
they say further that when dressing cod
llsh they frequently find young lobsters
whole inside of the larger fish. Evidently
young lobsters are becoming a delicate
morsel for some of their companions of
the sea. There Is a problem for the shell
fish commissioners to solve In the artifi
cial propagation of the lobster. Old fish
ermen about Watch Hill and vicinity tell
me that when they haul their lobster pots
now they get fifteen and twenty pounds
where they used to get one hundred."
The fishermen have no one to blame but
themselves. When lobsters were plentiful
they would kill the egg-bearing lobsters
as nuisances and bait destroyers. If they
had thrown them overboard the result
might have been different.â Ga

F. A. HYDE,
night Father VVyman of St. Mary's
Church, of which Murphy was a member,
received v coil by telephone to hasten to
the hospital to administer the last eacra
luems to the dying man. When Father
Wyman had gone through the red tape
necessary to pass through thÂ« outer doora
uf the hospital he askeU to be conducted
to Murphy's room.
"You cannot see him," was the reply
of a brusijuu attendant, "lie died half
an hour ago."
Ass Father Wyman passed out of the
hospital some friends of the- dead man,
knowing the priest's mission, expressed
their Indignation ut the manner in which
Murphy nud been treated. They were
his Irk-nds and had been trying in vain
to learn of la* condition. They did not
know that be was dead until they were
told by Che priest.
"We claim mat a priest has just as
much right to see any member of his
flock who is sick and dying as a physician
has." s*ld Father Wyman last evening.
"Any truo prleÂ»t would go through lire
nr.d water to reach the bedside of a dying
Catholic, even if he had heard from a
hundred outsiders that the man had re
fused to see him. Dr. Cheney prevented
Fatht r Hickey from doing what his con
science prompted on the pretext that a
lons time previous Murphy had been
.- 1 .- tt Â« â¢ : by some one- net mentioned If he
wishvd to see a priest and had said "no.*
How did Cheney know that Murphy had
hot or would. n<Â«t have changed his mind
after seeing Father key? His true
condition had. probably been kept from
him. I do not believe, however, that
Murphy e-yer refused to see a priest or
had boon nsked- If he wanted to see one.
H* was a regular attendant at our church
arc! took n dorp Interest in his relislon.
"It is evident that l>r. Cheney thounht
_tha_L^li>' nri(?orsirvÂ»l â - --. -- - Im^iiu-ss
bcttvr than the priest himself. Priests are
educated- geTiTlerm-n. 'who virit the sick
and the dying with Just as definite a pur
pose in view as the physician, and they
know" better than nny one else can tell
them whom they ought and whom they
oujtht nut to f>v.
"I. feel in conscience bound to Inform
all of my parishioners, and the Catholics
In general In-, this community, how Dr.
Cheney has acted In this matter, in case
any. of th. m should have the terrible and
Irreparable.m isfortune of.dying without
the Inst fcacrament while under his treat
ment.
Dr. . Cheney explained last night that
Father Hickey had boon refused admis
sion to the Bi<*k room at Murphy's re
quest, and that, he (the doctor) had had
nothing to do with the case.
"Tho priest applied for admission to one
nf the attendants, who asked Murphy If
he desired to fco him. He replied that he
was not a Catholic and did not .nt to
see any one from that church."
The docjnr does n-Â»t explain how It was
that tho attendant did not go to Murphy's
room with any such message; how It was
that thÂ© attendant told the priest that
Dr. Cheney had issued the orders some
time before the visit r.f the clergyman;
how It was that he himself attempted to
throw the blame for the affair on Dr.
Hunt!- . and how It was. ... was
cornered, that he admitted that the Cath
olic priests hnd been barred out of the
sick room In obedience to his commands.
on every corner dlsoussnlg the outrage.
Threats of lynching are heard on all sides
and despite the advice of cooler heads an
attempt may. be made to deal out sum
mary Justice. It Is probable that before
morning Jason will be secretly taken to
Point Reyes and ther* put on board the
train for San Rafael in order to Eave his

Line His Purse.
TRIED TO WORK FRUIT MEN
PARIS COMMISSIONERS WOR
RIED OVER EMPLOYE'S ACT.
Circular Letter Sent to Growers by
Head of the Horticultural De
partment Soliciting Com
pensation.
[Â» A. Emlay, head of the department of
horticulture erf th-3 California-Paris Expo
sition Commission, has succeeded In
bringing serious discredit on the work of
the commission by the peculiar methods
he has pursued in seeking to induce the
fruit growers of the State to exhibit their
products at the great International expo
sition. Whether Mr. Emlay erred through
ignorance or whether his action was the
result of a deliberate attempt to use his
official position to line his purse la not
a question of great moment. The fact
remains that he has succeeded In creating
a feeling of distrust among the grower*
which threatens to seriously Interfere
with the success of the California exhibit
at the French capital in I>jO.
A short time ago Emlay sent out a cir
cular letter to the horticulturists of <'all
fornla, In wliich he practically offered to
â¢i.-ir Interests at the â¢
Miion for a consideration, citing bia po 1

Intention of â¢â¢grafting" when he formu

â¢'1 understand," said Mr. Itunyon yes
terday, "that one of the leading horticul
turist.-, of the Btate, after making ar
rancements to send an exhibit to Paris,
ted Mr. Emlay to dispose of the
HUM at the clone of the exhibition, at tin
s:ime time informing him that he would
. I t..r US trouble. The exhibitor's
Idea was that this would be morÂ»' desir
able frojn his point of view than to Incur
the expense of shljiplng the stuff back to
California. Mr. Emlay accepted the prop
osition and after thinking the matter over
came to thÂ»' conclusion that it would be a
good Idea to make similar arrangem> nts
with other exhibitors. H<- accordingly
Bent out the circular, which has â 
ail the trouble. It was a bad mistake,
Very much regretted, which we had pectl
i far us possible as soon as the
n. alter was called to our attention, but I
do not think Mr. Kmlay had any criminal
Intent to mulct the growers."
Â» if course the Commissioners would
have demanded the resignation of Mr.
Emlay at once had they thought for a
moment that lie was "grafting." Some
people there are, however, who think that
If Emlay Is not guilty of "'grafting" hi*
action oertalnl] proves him to be wholly
unfitted i<-r the important position he
holds, because of his want of tact and
luck of Intelligence. In either case they
believe thai the Interests of the State de
mand his removal. It is paid that other
subordinates on the commission, holding
similar positions to that of Mr. Emlay,
have shown an Inclination to use their
positions to their Individual profit, but
Emlay is the only one who has come bold
ly out with a letter soliciting patronage.

GULL KILLING STOPPED.
Women's Hats Will Have No More
Sea Fowl Quills on Them.
The recent fashion of wealing a long
feather in the up-to-date female head
covering has attracted the attention of
the officers of the Society for the Preven
tion of Cruelty to Animals, who were
curious to know from what particular
kind of bird the long quills come. Th.-re
were turkey and geese feathers and a few
that might have once been a part of the
make-up of eagles and hawks, but the
most common quills turned out to be the
feathers of the seagulls. The question
arose M to where these feathers wore
coming from, and the mystery was solved
yesterday by the statement of Dr. C. E.
Case, secretary of the Mann County
branch of the organization. Dr. Case
learned that there was a man making a
business of slaughtering seagulls in ;ir
Sausalito for the San Francisco market.
The long feathers of the wings were kept
Intact to be used upon the golf and
soldier hats of the ladies of this city,
while the birds' heads and plumage were
converted into various shaped ornaments
for the milliner to use. Dr. Case stated
that one man. Christianson Auk. had a
monopoly of the business, and was mak
ing considerable money by killing these
harmless and useful sea fowls at the
price of 15 cents each. Whether improper
uso was made of the carcasses of the
slaughtered birds is not known, but 15
cents gave the hunter a good profit on
his efforts. Dr. Case determined to put
a stop to this business, and on Wednes
day he arrested the man, and prosecuted
him under the very broad Marin County
game ordinance, which covers all kinds
of birds excepting pests and game birds
in the open season. Auk pleaded guilty
and was glad to escape as easily as ho
lid, the punishment being light on ac
count of the man's age. He at once com
municated to a number of crab fisher
men the experience he had with the
ofllcers of the society, and the entire crew
pulled up stakes and moved out of the
county. It seems that they also had been
slaughtering seagulls to bait their nets
with.

WMDDING TRIP
Miss Shipley and L, A. Lar
sen Combine Business
With Pleasure.
The music loving people of the city, and
the State as well, will be surprised to
learn of the marriage of two favorite mu
sicians. It was generally known for many
months that I* A. Larsen of the Knicker
bocker Quartet and Miss Nellie Shipley,
the gifted cornet player, were engaged but
no date had been set for the happy event
to take place. The quartet recently made
an arrangement to tour the State with
the Knickerbocker concert company, and
Miss Shipley's name appeared as one of
the attractions on the bills. Three days
ago Mr. I.ar.s. n had a bright thought and
that was that the tour of California would
be Just the thing for a bridal trip, and he
communicated his thought to the lady. Of
course such a move would be a little sud
den, but the lady was equal to the occa
sion and gave her consent.
It took just two days to make the nec
essary arrangements, and forty-eight
hours after the proposition was made the
young people were made man and wife.
The ceremony was performed by the Rev.
Mr. Lion in St. Stephen's Church, on Ful
ton street. Wednesday evening, and only a
few immediate friends and relatives of the
contracting parties were present- The
quartet was there and sang several appro
priate piecea, M. McCurrle taking the sec
ond bass in the stead of the regular song
ster, who was engaged in getting married.
Professor Lucy of the company mentioned
presided at the organ. Thus passed from
itatchelordom the last member of the well
known quartet. The newly wedded couple
and company will start on their wedding
trip to-morrow. â¢ .

The Teacher Body Will Attempt, to
Arrange an Amicable Adjust

Union Trust Company.
Yesterday's ma.*s-meetlng of school
manns and masters at the Obis' High
School was productive of not much in the
way of business and of a good deal In
the way of good, warm wrangling. The
litigation committee, which for the past
six months has had charge of all n itten
looking to the collection of back claims
and salaries, was continual In Its ofllce
and given increased powers, but !t was
not done without considerable heated dts
cusslon between the members of the com
mittee and their supporters and that
other division of the teacher body which
has lately had much fault to find with the
manner in which the committee business
was being conducted.
Professor Elisha Rrooks acted as chair
man and C. EL Ham as secretary. The
opening statement was made by C. <j.
Murphy, chairman of the litigation com
mittee, who read and submitted the re
port without making any recommenda
tions. The report recited the history of
the compromise made with the merchant
creditors of the School Department, by
which the payment of the teachers'
salaries for January and June, IM9, was
assured, and also suggested two courses
by which the teachers' share of the $27.
831 balance, now In the hands of tho
T'nlon Trust Company awaiting distribu
tion, might be collected. These sug
gestions were:
Firstâ To make a settlement with the
Union Trust Company.
Secondâ To refuse to make a settlement,
and thereby compel the I'riion Trust Com
pany to bring suit and distribute the
money in that way.
The submission of tho report was *he

Murphy came to the front of the stage
at this and turned Bturgla over a time or
so on a redhot grill. He referred to the
circular which Sturgls s.-nt broadcast
through the department ten days ago. in
which the litigation committee was
sharply criticised and accused of neglect
of duty, and asked the teachers sa
sembled to enher accept or reject the re
port upon its merits and not consider for
the time any other questions. After the
report had been disposed of,
would be time enough to attend to the
rest Of tho committee's affairs.

was shut off by the putting of the ques

A Fall of Eight Inches Reported in
the Vicinity of Summit.
The Southern Pacific Company's weath
er reports ft>r the last twenty-four hours
show but little change throughout the
Slat.-. In all sections the skies remain
overcast and threatening, while here and
there email showers have fallen to damp
â¢â¢ii things a little more. In the vicinity of
Santa Barbara, where the rainfall this
year has been the slightest and where the
â¢ farmers could, very well stand a little
more wetting, there lias been no rain at
all during the last day or two. though the
weather has been promising, a downpour
for some time. . . .
Up in the mountains the small showers
have been condensed into snow, with the
result that the Summit reports a fall of 8
Inches. Cascade 7 inches and Cisco 4
Inches, which is the first news of the kind
this season. Luckily th.- snowsheds that
wore burned down some time ago have
hern so repaired that, come what may,

Cognet was recently arrested at the in
stance of Ollva Muyot on the charge of
assault with a deadly weapon. She had
been living at De Klvas* residence. 5 Birch
avenue with her slater, and Coghet was
accused- of driving her out of the bouse
at the point of a. revolver. Tho reason.
Khe alleged, was because Cornel wanted
to get her away from the City, as De
Rivas owed her $400 in cash, and ha.l also
obtained from her $300 worth of Jewelry.
Cognet wanted De Rrraa married to his
in.law, as De Rtvas had sent to
Spain for $1000 to pay off Oava's claim,
and Cognet did not want her to get the
money.
The case against Cognet I* "till pending
