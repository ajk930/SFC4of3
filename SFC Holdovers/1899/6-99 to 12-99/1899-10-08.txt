WAR PRACTICALLY ON
IN THE TRANSVAAL
Great Britain Restrained From Beginning
Hostilities by Her Claim of Suzerainty
Over the Boers.
Old Fort at Mafeking, Where the Boers Are Concentrating Troops.
LONDON, Oct. Judging from the
reports from South Africa a state
of war practically exists between
Great Britain and the Transvaal.
This seems almost paradoxical in
conjunction with the fact that the British
diplomatic agent. Conyngham Greene, still
remains at Pretoria, and the further, fact
that the negotiations continue.
A solution of this apparent paradox
probably lies in an understanding of the
curious relations between the two Gov
ernments. Great Britain is not likely to
make a formal declaration of war against
what she considers a dependent nation,
the process being a mere Issue of orders
to a military force to restore the state of
sovereignty which she alleges originally
existed. Were England similarly at log
gerheads with a power recognized by her
us equal, pride and precedent would some
time ago have compelled her to break off
diplomatic intercourse. It Is this legend
of suzerainty that enables her to palaver
without loss of self-respect, and at the
amÂ» time to run a good chance of plac
ing the onus of beginning hostilities upon
the Boers, or, failing in that, to delay ac
tion until she has in the field a sufficient
force to overrun the Transvaal.
This Is the only ground on which It Is
possible to reconcile the Government's
passive reception of palpably hostile acts
on the part of the Boers, for it Is now
Impossible to believe that the Transvaal
forces are massing rely for defensive
purposes. Thus war appears to be the
only possible outcome. If the Boers are
determined to participate in the conflict,
hostilities are only a question of days. If
England is allowed to take her own time,
then two months may elapse before the
first blow is struck.
Though the week has produced no ne
gotiations tending to thro.. light up<.n the
merits of the case, it Is evident that ne
gotiations had not ceased so far as diplo
matic correspondence Is concerned.
The pith of the whole dispute, however.
Is dally becoming clearer. The Boers are
thoroughly convinced that their freedom
Is menaced] and England is convinced that
her supremacy in South Africa is threat
ened. This constitutes an Impasse,
against which pacific measures can
scarcely be effective.
As the possibility of war increases Brit
ish conjecture as to the unfriendly atti
tude of other European powers increases.
Reference is frequently made to probable
Russian aggression In Asia; while it is
thought that France, in the evei of hos
tilities, is sure to become active i 1 North
ern Africa. Interference at the seat of
â¢war itself is not contemplated; for th ''
apples which France and Russia wish to
pick do not grow in South Africa. Dela
goa Bay is naturally closely watched in
thi6 connection: The Gorman press is
making capital out of the report that
Great Britain is sacrificing her friendship
with the United States in the Bamoam af
fair In ord.r to gain Germany's support in
the settlement at Delagoa Bay.
It seems "tain that an entirely new
plan of government is being con*idereÂ«l by
the European powers interested In San
but the? Associated Press is able to astcrt
authoritatively that such negotiations vill
in no way result disadvantageously or

in the insinuation that 'l)" attitude of tie
British Foreign Office toward Washington
has been altered by Great Britain's dÂ»
eire to secure Germany's co-operation at
Delagoa Hay.

tho matter to-day, said: "Germany it

Many officers believe that President

this view. He said to-day: "1 do not con

The Government Is much criticised by
many of the papers of their own follow
i Ing, as well as by the military assemblies,
j for tardiness in sending out the army

: if Majuba Hill repeats Itself, Lord Salls-
I bury will have only himself to blame.
i The Admiralty Is also coming In for a
share of cr.iicism over the length of time
required to get transports. Incompetence
and bungling are alleged. Lieutenant J.
C. Colwell, United States naval attache
in London, when asked regarding this
charge said:
"I believe that the Admiralty has done
splendidly, fully maintaining the reputa
tion of the British navy. I am fairly ac
quainted with the details of the present
operations, and I believe they are a proof
oi the great advantage to be gained by
having the navy control the transporta
tion of troops."

â¢ of Great Britain's military
preparations 'an scarcely be grasped by
the more reading of individual items as
they appear from day to day. A fair no
tion of their immensity can be gained from
j the semi-official statement that for the
transport of the army corps about seventy
ships of from 2000 to 4ijOO tons burden are
required, not Including a score or more
j of transports already on the way to the
Cape. If these vessels effectively disem
bark their cargoes of men, horses and
I equipment within five weeks from their
; date of sailing, the programme will have
fulfilled the forecasts of the most opti
mistic British military experts. If all the
I troops are able to lake their places as
component parts of the army corps by tho
1 end of November they will have done, ac
cording to the best available opinion, re
markably well. The disembarkation of
1 General Shafter's army from its thirty
i seven transports Is not forgotten by Brlt
i ish officers. Although the vessels to be
! employed In the Cape service are larger
on the average than those which carried
the Americans to Santiago de Cuba, the
admiralty, In accordance with the exist
ing regulations, is supplying them all and
taking complete charge from water's edge

BOERS REPORTED TO
BE ABOUT TO YIELD
LONDON, Oct. 7.â The most important
' news comes from the Transvaal to-night,
which, if true, probably indicates that the
South African republic is about to yield,
. or in any ca.ie that the Boers have aban
< doned all ideas of invading Natal.
The news is comprised In a cablegram
from Newcastle, Natal, which says that
the farmers who arrived there to-day j
from the Buffalo River state that the
B';--rH are returning to their homes, leav
ing patrols along the river. The comman
i ders still remain on the Free State bor
der.
The dispatch also says that the feeling ,
i at Newcastle now is that the Boers do not
I Intend to attack that place and that the
i evacuation of the town was premature.
! A dispatch from Durban also states that
j the excitement there has abated, owing to
I the Hours holding back from the frontier.
This retirement of the Boers is what the
I British war authorities have exp?-cted, as
j their defective commissariat would pre
vent â¢ them from long remaining massed
along the border. Telegrams received here
lately have made frequent reference to the
scarcity of forage and supplies in the Boer
laagers and have stated that many of
those in the camps were inclined to strike
for their homes unless active operations
were undertaken Immediately.
The dispatch from Newcastle looks as
though they had done as they threatened
and had abandoned the idea of fighting.
Meanwhile further transports from India,
j with two field hospitals and hussars, have
arrived at Durban and the men and ma
| terial were forwarded to Ladysmith in
stantly. General Sir George Stewart
White, V. C, who will command the Brit
ish forces in Natal, has also arrived and
landed. He was greeted by a large crowd.
General Sir William Symoris, his second
In command, came from Glencoe to meet
him, showing that he does not fear a
Boer incursion into North Natal. A num
ber of other officers were present and the
whole party left by train for Ploter
! maritzburg amid great excitement and
j cries of "Remember Majuba."
ANTI-BRITISH SPIRIT
OF THE GERMAN PRESS
BERLIN, Oct. 7.-Affalrs in South Af
rica are still commented upon in the press
hero and elsewhere in the same anti-
British spirit. Even the Liberal press !b
now hostile to England. The Frankfort
Zeitung says:
"It is a regrettable face that even in a
constitutional country like England the
Cabinet is enabled to put Parliament in
the presence of accomplished facts in a
way that makes it almost impossible for
Parliament to do anything but consent to
warlike measures."
The Cologne Gazette calls the coming
struggle of the Boers "heroic, with the
same heroic thought as inspired their
struggle in 18S1."
"They go Into the fight fearlessly," says
tho Rhenish organ, "and the world may
hear of their losing battles, but never of
thoir loping courage or hope."
The influential Hanover Courier consid
ers that Germany's chances will be very
poor if England vanquishes the Boers, as
then German Southwest Africa will be
lost.
The papers are also considering the
military probabilities, the general opinion
being that England will not be ready to
take the offensive until November. In
the meantime, it is believed the Boers
will do England rral damage. The mili
tary expert of the Cologne Gazette's staff
says: "German and French artillery and
the Mauser will be opposed to English
weapons. Both sides, are good shots and
military experts will follow the duel,
which will be mainly decided by the rifle
with keen Interest."
Some of the papers discuss the eco
nomic consequences of the war. The Ber
liner Tageblatt believes that a diminu
tion of the gold output would seriously
affect business. The Government press
remains mute, with the exception of the
North German Gazette, which recalls the
fact that the Transvaal has no right to
expect German Outlanders to render mili
tary service.

PONCE IS IN A COLLISION
Sending Vessel Stniok by a Drifting Steamer,
and Signor Marooni Is Enabled to G.ve
an Additional Example of the Value
of His Woncerful Work.
Special Dispatch to The CÂ«Jt
NEW YORK, Oct. 7.â Ag-ain to-day
did. the Marconi system of wireless
telegraphy meet every demand
made upon it. All during- the day
Signor Marconi kept the yachts in
view, at the same tim<' giving those asbcre
i almost as plain an uruierKtandlng of the
' maneuvering that was being done as was
] enjoyed by the excursionists.
Unfortunately for those on the steam
j ship Ponce, the view of the start of the
| yachts, which was a magnificent one, was
i marred by what for a moment promised
' to be an accident of serious results. The
Cambridge, a light-draft steamer from
Baltimore, was caught in the current and
drifted across the bow of the Ponce. Cap
tain Lloyd was on the bridge with "Dyna
i mlts Johnnie" O'Brien. Both saw that a
' crash was imminent, and in a moment the
; great whistle of the Ponce sounded a ter
! rifle warning, while the signal to the en
] gine room set the propeller in motion for
1 a sternway.
The momentum of the Ponce, however,
j was too great, and she went crashing Into
! the smaller craft, whose railing was
crushed in and a hole made in her hull.
; For a time it was feared that the Cam
i bridge would sink, and her captain asked
the Ponce to stand by ready to take off
', the passengers should it become neces
sary. All was excitement on the Ponce,
I and" for a few momenta a panic was nar
: rowly averted on the Cambridge. Had
there been a larger crowd on the unfortu
nate boat there certainly would have been
! loss of life. As it was, several women
; falntt-d, while others were restrained
; from hurling themselves overboard into
' the water.
The Ponce did not have time to hnck
out of the hole her nose had made in the
j Cambridge before Signor Marconi was
: giving the news of the accident to the
I operators at Navesink. Fortunately It
â  was learned before great excitement could
! be caused ashore that the damage to the
Cambridge was Blight and the passengers
were in no dang-r.
While all this was going on the final
i signal for the rn.ee had boon given, and
i the Columbia and the Shamrock went
I over the line with as pretty a start as has
ever been seen in any race for the Amer-
I ica's cup. Just as soon as it was di ter
mlned that the Cambridge was in no dan
ger all eyes were again turned on the
yachts, and bulletins of the race, which
| had been Interrupted, were resumed.
I The attempt of the Shamrock to blanket
and take the wind from the Columbia was
flashed to the bulletin boards in New York
City long before it was known by those
; who were watching th<; maneuver Whether
: it would be successful. Again, the experi
'. mentlng with the sails which was going
on was fully described by Signor Marconi.
Often as a certain sail would be carried in
â  the stops into position, those on shore
â  watching the race through Signor Mar
coni's eyes knew what was being at
! tempted before the canvas was given to
: the wind. Finally, when about a mile
' from the start, the Columbia gradually
drew away from the challenger, the suc
cess of the American yacht was bulletined
before half the boat's length separated
the two contestants. As usual, the ap
paratus employed by Signor Marconi was
i accurate in its work, and was watched by
' all who could crowd near the chart room.
I Aboard the Ponce was Lieutenant
Commander Hubert yon Rebeurpaschwltz,
naval attache of the German Embassy in
Washington, who officially represented
his Government in watching the opera
tions of Signor Marconi. Although the
German was Intensely interested in tlv>
contest going on between the Columbia
and Shamrock he seldom took his atten
tion from the apparatus used in sending
messages ashore. At the close of the day
he expressed himself as more than pleas
ed with what he had seen.
"The Herald is to be congratulated."
said the lieutenant commander. "This
has been the ilrst time that I have seen
the Columbia and Shamrock together, but
on Tuesday and Thursday Signor Mar
coni, through the Herald, made it possi
ble for me to watch the yachts almost as
well as I havo been able to do to-day.
However, 1 had no adequate idea of the j
importance of the work being done until ]
I saw for myself. The world will accept
this discovery just as it has accepted
everything else, and in a very short time
the people will cease to wonder. But it
Is all really marvelous. Signor Marconi
has gone far in advance of his contem
porary workers in the field of practical
science as applied to electricity. No
doubt England is already making ar
rangements to use wireless telegraphy in
the war which Impends in South Africa.
There it will be given a severe test, which j
I have no doubt will be successfully met.
Here we are away out on the ocean with
out tangible connection with the land.
and yet the Herald is enabled to tell us ,
that Queen Victoria has called out the
reserves. Her Majesty's action makes j
it appear as though peace is now im
possible yet. Important as her act is it '
is not. In my mind, of so great importance
as In the discovery which has made it !
possible for us to know that it had been j
taken. Of course It Is impossible for me j
to say how much importance my report I
to the German Government will have, !
but 1 venture the assertion that the ex- !
ample of the Italian Government, using
tho Marconi system on all its war vessels, j
will speedily be followed by every other !
naval power."
From the Ponce upward of 2000 words I
were bulletined ashore during the yacht '
race, and more than the usual number of !
private messages were sent. Some of the
latter were cabled to England, while oth
ers were intended for friends in distant
cities in the United States.
In addition to sending to the Ponce
news of Queen Victoria's action in call-

GRAND STRUGGLE FOR
THE AMERICA'S CUP
Columbia and Shamrock Fight Gamely
for Supremacy, but the Wind Fails
and the Third Race Is a Fizzle.
Steamers Ponce and Cambridge in Collision.
ON BOARD THE STEAMSHIP PONCE, OFF THE HIGHLANDS OF NOVESINK, Oct. 7-
Another fizzle, but a grand struggle. A race which was a fight fron) gun to gun.
A finer struggle for the cup was never witnessed. The yachts got off nearly to
gether. Each at times had an advantage over the other, but neither was able to shaKe
off her rival. The turn of the staÃeboat was the closest ever seen- The Shamrock led
around it, but the Columbia almost lapped her, and when around can)e into wind
ward position and stood off shore to begin tt)e long, hard fight for home against the
wind. But there was not wind enough to tal^e the rivals home. They were still sev
eral miles from the Sandy HooK lightship when the gun ended the struggle The
ShamrocK did remarKably fine windward worK- The Columbia was handled splen
didly, but she did no 1 : do as well In reaching as on Thursday, owing to the roll of the
sea. Her satis suffered by comparison with the Shamrock's. The question of which
is the better boat in light weather is still a matter of opinion.
Three efforts at a decision in this cup
keeping ,ir cup-losing matter and the tale
Is yet to run. Three attempts at racing
and throe resultant flukes, and all that is
known of tho ability of either yacht to
hi ;it tho other is that on the first occasion
the Columbia had a slight advantage at
the inconclusive ending of the contest:
that on the second trial the two finished
on even terms, and In yesterday's unsat
isfactory bout the American boat quit
with a slight lead. The averaged-up prob
lem stands where it rested before the con
testants met.
lint it is not so much a question as to
which yacht is the speedier in a race. It
is when there is going to be one. That'B
it. That's the problem which overshad
ows that other one regarding relative
merits. What the people are asking now
is: "When is the wind going to blow long
I'lmtitrh for one to see which of these
j yachts is the better boat?"
"White folks and women," the Southern
j darky says, " Is mighty onsartin'." The
I same may be said of the New York
wp.it her. The Weather Bureau promised
' a wind that would send the yachts kiting
| over tho course, and during the early
morning and forenoon there was every
sign that the promise would be fulfilled.
But a change came as the day wore on.
The wind weakened as the hours went
by, and the heavy sea, which had been
rolled up by the gale of Friday and Frf
dny night, moderated to a long rhythmic
swell.
It was blowing a good twelve to fifteen
miles an hour breeze when the yachts
stood out to the starting line. It was
from the north-northeast, and the course
was laid 'south-southeast to the turning
mark, anchored fifteen miles down the
coast. The sea was rolling in a heavy
swell from the northward and eastward,
so heavy that the yachts would frequently
disappear to their main booms behind the
bulky rollers.
There was but little maneuvering for
position before the start, and the starting
gun found both yachts near the line. To
observers it seemed that they crossed it
in company, the Columbia setting her bal
loon jib as she went over it, the Sham
rock luffing up under baby jib and jib top
sail, seeking to gain the weather berth.
To prevent that the Columbia also stood
away to the westward, and the first part
of the race was merely a luffing match
for windward position.
Neither gaining any advantage in that
direction, the Shamrock took in her baby
| jib topsail, set a lug foresail in place of
j the staysail, and breaking out her bal
' loon Jib as the Columbia set her spinnaker
i aloft, the two settled down to plain sail
! ing. Meanwhile the wind was gradually
1 dying out, and before the first hour went
i by both yachts were dipping their balloon
jibs aback with every pitch of the sea.
They had plenty of room on that race
; down the wind, the lane they traveled be
i ing a full four miles in width. On their
I starboard hand was a line of torpedo
boats, under command of Lieutenant Com.
! mander John C. Fremont, which kept the
i excursion fleet on that side well clear of
j the course of the racing yachts. On the
! port hand was a line of revenue cutters,
; commanded by Captain Robley D. Evans,
i guarding the seaward side of the pre
scribed course.
As the yachts were midway In the run
to the turning point, a nomadic freighter
came blundering up the lane from the
southern end. The cutters tooted warn
ing signals, but the stranger kept on, and
not until the auxiliary yacht Allen had
fired two shots did the vessel sheer out
of the course of the racers.
The spectacular feature of the race lay
at the outer mark and at a time when
the yachts were rounding It. That was
the turning point of the race, but it was
no turning point in the fortunes of the
contestants.
One may live long and never again 6ee
such a spectacle as was presented when
the two yachts swung- around the stake
in company and so close together that
one was sailinc in the other's shadow.
There was hardly a second's difference
between the two and to an unofficial ob
server of the race the contest might yet
I be in doubt, so close were the yachts to
j gether when they made the turn.
The manner in which they approached
the mark was almost as exciting as the
way in which they rounded it. The Sham
rock, which had stood a few hundred
yards to the westward of the line, gybed
around to the starboard tack and headed
straight for the mark, intending to keep
it on her starboard hand in turning and
intending, moreover, to get around it
first. That well laid plan of hers went
all aglee through a clever maneuver of
the Columbia's captain. That vessel, hur
rying to the mark, managed by a fine
bit of seamanship and a quick shift of
the helm to interpose between the Sham
rock and the stake boat just at the mo
ment when that point was bobbing past
the Shamrock's bow.
Round went the wheel of the Columbia,
up went the tiller of the Shamrock, and,
turning on their heels, the two boats
| swung around the stake, beam to beam,
and so close together that a penny might
havo been flipped from one deck to the
other. Around they came with tho Co
lumbia's bowsprit slightly overlapping
that of the Shamrock. But so slight was
the lead of that vessel with its narrow
margin of Inches or of seconds that no
one could tell by what distance she led.
Trimming the sheets flat aft as they came
into the wind the two headed back to the
finish line, close hauled and with booms
to port.
Then followed a series of tacking and
reaching In search of the wind or In an
effort to blanket each other or to get the
best position. As far as one could see
there was nothing to criticize in the
handling of either boat, both being man
aged with a skill that compelled the ad
miration of all who followed the contest.
The wind grew steadily lighter, and
owing to its fluky character, which
worked alternately to the advantage of
one and then to the other, first one yacht
had the lead and then its rival. And as
the hours wore on it began to look as
though the history of the two preceding
races would be again repeated.
This feeling became conviction when, at
4 o'clock, tho finish was still three or
four miles away and the yachts were
bobbing about in a breeze that was not
very far removed from no breeze at all.
Then boomeu a gun announcing that the
race was off, the Columbia then being ap
parently about 250 yards nearer the goal
than was her rival.
The excursion fleet was out in as great
a force as in any of the preceding days,
and in the drunken beam-sea roll many
of the excursionists discovered what sea
sickness is, if perchance they had not
made the discovery before the boats did
some wild reeling in the sea that surged
about the lightship while waiting for the
start of the race.
Dipping their noses deep in the sea.
Racking their stays and stanchions free;
In the wash of the wind-whipped tide.
The wallowing as exceedingly uncom
fortable and the rolling was but little
lessened when the fleet Rot under way
and stood down the course in company
with the racers. The run back was not so
disquieting, the sea then having moder
ated so much that but little motion was
felt on the larger craft.
TECHNICAL
VERSION OF THE
THIRD FAILURE
NEW YORK, Oct. 7.â There was a
spanking breeze from the northeast and
a heavy swell from the eastward when
the yacht Columbia, under mainsail and
jib, filled away from a point oft the south
west spit at 9:25 to-day and, with sheets
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
! eased a trifle, headed for the Sandy Hook
| lightship at a twelve-knot clip.
I Besides Managing Owner Iselin and Mrs.
i Iselin, there were on board Herbert Leeds,
; Captain Nat Herreshoff, who when the
; yacht passed the Associated Press boat
j John Nickols was lying on the weather
I side of the deck watching the sails
through a pair of green goggles; Captain
Woodbury Kane, Newbury Thorne and
Hugh Kelly, the la:~t named representing
j the Royal Ulster Yacht Club. Captain
; Barr had the wheel to windward, one of
the crew assisting on the lee .side. The
rest of the crew was distributed along the
weather rail. The Columbia was carrying
the same mainsail as on Thursday.
The Shamrock made an early start from
Sandy Hook Bay. She passed out by the
point of the Hook at 9:06, carrying the
same sail as the Columbia, arriving off
the lightship at a few minutes before 10.
On her deck were seen Henry F. Lippett,
the New York Club's representative. Sail
! maker Ratsey, Hugh McGill Downey,
j Sherman Crawford and Captains Ben
j Parker, Hogarth and Wringe. At 10:20
I the Columbia sent up her working topsail
;in stops, the wind being strong enough
at that time to warrant the Betting of
' that sail, but even while they were hoist-
I ing it the wind lightened considerably.
| and fifteen minutes later the No. :> club
topsail was bent on. The Shamrock a^so
j bent on a No. 2 club topsail, and both
; yachts set these sails at almost the same
â  time.
j At 10:50 the tug which was to drop the
i outer mark started to log off the course
;of fifteen miles to leeward. Pour minutes
; later down came the Shamrock's club top
sail, and in just nine minutes her big
jackyarder was mastheaded and si
i out. The Columbia kept her No. l
i sail on. Captain Barr probably hoping
j that it would be a more d^esirable sail in
i the windward work and that it would not

11:20 the gun to start. When the warn
\ ing signal was given both yachts were on
the starboard tack, east of the committee
boat, the Columbia to windward, and both
J heading to the southwest. The wind was
! then light from the north-northeast, with
, little promise ot freshening. The Colum-
I bia luffed first of the two, until she was
j close on the wind on the starboard tack,
! heading as if to cross the committee
I boafs bow. The Shamrock stood on a
i little longer, then jibed and came up on
the same tack, setting her staysail as she
did so. Captain Barr, to fill in the time
kept the Columbia off for about thirty
seconds, then luffing her sharp on the
wind again headed her to fetch close by
the committee boat's bow on the way to
the line. Her staysail had not been set,
and the Shamrock was traveling with bet
ter headway toward the same spot. Skip
per Hogarth, seeing his chance, it now
being less than a minute before gunfire,
sent the Shamrock's bowsprit close along
the Columbia's lee quarter, ready to luff
out at gunfire if the opportunity came.
Both yachts were running parallel to the
line, neither daring to keep off until the
signal. They were able to be at the cen
ter of the line at gunfire. Quick as a flash
Skipper Hogarth put her helm down, shot
the Shamrock across the Columbia's wall
and as he straightened her up asain tier
bowsprit overlapped the Columbia's
weather quarter. He was able to accom
plish this by reason of the Irish boat
having better headway than the Colum
bia. Captain Barr held his course almost
over to the lightship at the w^ath^r Bide
of the line before sweeping off, thus try
ing to force Hogarth out of the command
ing position which he had so cleverly ob
tained, but in vain. The Shamrock not
only held her position, out began to over
haul the other and blanket her.
The official time at the start was: Co
lumbia, 11:21:02; Shamrock, 11:21:19.
As on one of the previous races Hogarth
did not set his balloon jib topsail, being
better prepared with the No. 2 lib toDsaJi2

waa the crowd in Herald Square to watch

gather there at 10 o'clock this morning;
an hour before I ha yachts were scheduled

tho end of the contest he kept th.> public
accurately Informed of the exact position
of tho two yachts.
It was demonstrated during- the trial
on Thursday that wireless telegraphy is
of Inestimable, vttiuo for reporting events
at sea during 810 weather. It waa
demonstrated to-day that when tha nlr ia
clear as In Juno the wonderful system Is
equally valuable. Through the Krrrat na

sword. As Is the opinion of Germany, so
is the opinion of the world, nt least In so
far as the world la still anti-British. The
victory of Great Britain will Induce Rus
sia and Franco to make headway In Asia
ugrnlnst her. This is a necessary outcome
of the situation. The Boers have only
themselves to rely upon In a hard light.
Time baa Irretrievably gone by when
other countries would nave Interfered out

risk Its resources or the lives of its peo

that all, nave under such conditions,
should leave to God the adjustment of the

AN UNSOPHISTICATED
MAID AND A STRANGER
FURTHER ADVENTURE OF C. H.
JONES OF PORTLAND.
Attempting to Relieve Beauty in
Distress, He Succeeds Too Well
for His Own Finan
cial Good.
Clarence Tl. Jones, the ynunsrâ very
young theatrical manager from Port
lnrnl. who is Btaying at the Palace Hotel,
seems fated to play knight errant to
(lams. 'is in distreaa and get little thanks
tor his gallantry.
The story of hla Anpel Island episode,
which was published In yesterday's Call,
la but one of several adventures that
have befallen this romantic Individual
since his advent hi this city some eight
days nffo.
Shortly after his arrival Mr. Jones
thought he would take n little walk. He
left the hostelry ut its Market street en
trance and had gone but half a block
or BO toward the ferry when lie was ac
i by a young and beautiful female
who begged him to stop and harken to her
tale of woe.
Many men would have passed on un
heeding. Not so tho chivalrous Jones.
Distressed loveliness was to him some
thing sacred, nnd every fiber of his being
tingled With sympathy as lie listened to
the story of misfortune that the poor, un
sophisticated young thing poured Into his
ears.
She was a country lass who had come
to this great city In the hope of beini?
able to get something to do which might
help her to support a widowed mother
and three paralyzed brothers whom she
had left at home.
She had applied at place after place for
a position, but all her efforts to tlnd em
ployment had proved futile. Little by lit
tle her slender stock of ready means bad
drifted away until now she found herself
alone on the streets at night with no
where to go to lay her head. She was
also sick and faint from want of food.
Did Mr. Jones know where she could go
and get some good advice?
Jones did. She could get all the advice
she wanted from him, but first she had
better step Into a near-by cafe and get
something which would serve to brace up
her shattered system. With charming
simplicity of manner and complete truth
fulness of disposition the maiden stepped
In. She seemed to feel â¢ that she was un
der the guidance of a man of honor and
that all would be well.
What would she take? She did not
know, so Jones ordered two whiskies
one as a stimulant for the maiden and
the other to make the quarter even and
relieve the waiter of the necessity of
bringing any change.
Tho liquor was brought and the maiden
took hers without water, which only
served to further accentuate her charm-
Ing simplicity.
"Now, little girl," said the sympathetic
Jones, "place your head on my manly
shirtfront and pour out your troubles to
one who will do all that he can to re
lieve you."
The maiden did as she was bid. hut,
becoming overcome with the magnitude
of her misfortune, could do nothing but
weep. ; Finally her sobs ceased and she
excused herself while she went out to re
arrange her golden tresses and dry her
deep blue eyes.
Jones waited, but the maiden never re
turned. Possibly the $25 she took with
her. and which had previously rested In
the Jones vest pocket, relieved her from
the necessity of trespassing further on
the kindness of a stranger.
Jones now realises only too well that
the maiden actually was looking for
something to do. It was the unhappy fate
of the man from Portland to be that
something.

EXCURSIONISTS AND GAMBLERS
BATTLE ON THE GEORGEANNA
Boat Started for the Yacht Races, but When a
Few Miles Out the Engines Were
Stopped, Games Opened and a
Free Fight Ensued.
NEW YORK, Oct. 7â With band play
ing and flags flying and a merry party of
men find women aboard, the steamer
Georgeanna started this morning osten
sibly for the yacht race. With flag at
half-mast, union down, she returned
about 3 o'clock to be welcomed by a big
crowd of police.
It was a most thrilling story that the
Georgeanna's passengers had to tellâ a
story of a battle with gamblers on the
boat In which the gamblers were badly
worsted. The signal of distress was hoist
ed with the result that there was a return
to the city without even a glimpse of the
yachts. The Georgeanna had been adver
tised to carry passengers at $1 a head, but
some well dressed men found that even
a dollar was not needed to get aboard.
The Georgeanna waited a long tlm -
for* she started and her managers seemed
anxious to till the boat. When she did
leave her dock the passengers say she
steamed very slowly. Moreover they al
lege that, it was soon discovered that the
Georgeanna was not going in the direc
tion of the races, but was hugging the
Shore. Excursionists began to think they
saw a reason for this when faro tables,
roulette wheels, sweat boards, whe<
fortune and similar games of chance were
opened up In various parts of the boat.
Just off Sandy Hook the engines stopped
and the boat began to drift. Indignant
ticket holders began to gather on the up
fie.r deck. The ripple of grumbles grew
nto tidal waves and some one proposed
an Indignation meeting and named one
Captain Norton as chairman. Capta>:i
Norton is a one-armed veteran and events
proved a good organiser. He took hold
promptly and a set of resolutions express
ing indignation were drawn up. A com
mittee was appointed to wait upon the
captain. According to Captain Norton he
was hiding in the hold. lie was fright
ened, but said he could do nothing as the
boat was out of coal.

Much Excitement Caused
in Sacred College and
Among Churchmen.
ACTION OF THE POPE
An Inventory of the Vatican's Art
Treasures Place Their Vaiua-
tion at $120,000,000.
Special rvispnteh to The Call.
ROME, Oct. 7.â The Pope has recently '
Inaugurated certain reforms appertaining
to church customs that have caused a
flutter of excitement in the sacred col
lege, and among all of the higher prel
ates. The innovation of his Holiness af
iv, ta the incomes of cardinals and the ;
exalted churchmen. For years it has been
the custom to permit these to hold three !
and Bom times as high as five posts, from
each of which more or less remuneration
was derived. Of course, this has permit
ted cardinals to obtain incomes far in
excess of their actual salaries. Now the :
P ipe has abolished all this. He has is
sued an edict to the effect that the high
est salary of a prelate shall not exceed
12,000 lires and a cardinal must content
himself rfth not more than ffi.OOO lires
The surplus revenues of those holding ex
tra offices shall be paid into the Vain an
treasury for the general use of the
church.
When it is remembered that some of
the cardinals enjoy an income of I
lires and Borne prelates as much a-s 70.000
it is evident that the treasury will I
tit by hundreds of thousands per year
It is confidently reported that this swe< p
mg reform is due to investigations made!

I Once more the indignation meeting as
sembled and Captain Norton declared it
time for action. "I move we haul down
: the flag, hoisi a signal of distress and
I head the boat for home." shouted Benja
! mln Lockwo id of Norwood, Conn. The
motion was carried with a rush. Before
; any one could interfere the flag was at
! half-mast union down. Then there was a
1 rush for the gamblers, and according to
! all witnesses the light was beautiful.
! Camp stools were used as weapons. Cap
| tain Norton seems to have directed things
i In military style, and the men who werÂ«
!at the gaming tables were routed. Some
I of them hid below.
The passengers seized wheels, layouts,
i tables and dice and hurled them over
board. Then the fiarht centered about tlm
Bag on the upper deck. Peter Purdue had
'< been left to guard the drooping colors by
Captain Norton. Some one hit him on
the head with a camp stool and he fell
1 senseless. Some one else cut the ha. yards.
When the excursion boat touched the
wharf a dozen nun made a dash for Hb
ertv. but in vain. One of the las- men to
', be taken out was the captain of the boat.
He was hooted as I â¢â  Left the pier and hÂ»
1 as though he was scared to the
verge of nervous prostration.
Captain Norton and the members of the
Indignation committee followed the pris
oners to the police station. After the ex
citement on the pier was over the police
hack and rounded up about fifteen
men, mostly members of the crew, whom
i they found hiding in various parts of Lie
boat. They also discovered some gam
bling implements.
The Georgeanna is one of the boats or
th< Lincoln Park Steamboat Company of
Philadelphia. She was sent here during
â¢ the yacht races to do an excursion busi
i ness.
One old Scotchman who was among trm
passengers was nearly heartbroken. H*
sobbed, "I saved up for a year to take my
I family to see the Shamrock race and now
1 am cheated out of it all."
church has lately been benefited by the
wills of certain wealthy cardinals. In
quiry Is said to have elicited the fact,
which the P^pe at first refused to believe,
that for twenty years past, during which
a number of cardinals had left large for
tunes, not one member of the sacred col
lege had bequeathed any money to t.Â»a
church, while bequests to hospitals werÂ«
made on a most insignificant scale.
The Pope has further shown his Inter
est in the financial affairs of the church
by having the Vatican's art treasures
valued by professional experts, who have
j just completed their labors. The contents
I of the gr-?at picture gallery were valued
at 70,000,000 lires. Raphael's "Transfisr
i uration" vat reckoned to be worth I
000 lires; Egyptian Museum. 56,000.000 lires;
I Numismatic collection, 22,000.000 lires; Pnr
! ghia Museum. 16,000,000 lires; various other
collections, 40,000,000 lires; and the Vatican
library, 200.000,000 lires. What is described
as the church's secret archives were
placed at 5.000,000 '.ires. In short, the
whole art tr> asures within the Vatican
are declared to bo worth 600.000.000 lires
I about $120.'MX>.0<XÂ». Ancient furniture was
i valued al â¢ 'â cs and tapestry and
: other stuffs at 6,000,000 lires. Sacred ob
were placed at 50,000,000 lires and
ry and precious stones at 70
; of which 12,000,000 lires' worth is the per
property of the present Pope. St.
: Peter's, with its statuary and other mar
j bles, its mosaic, sacred obiects, etc., was
valued by the same experts at 100.000.0ij0
lires.
CONCERNING FLOOD WATERS.
People of Los Angeles Take an Ac
tive Interest in the Matter.
LOS ANGELES. Oct. 7.â The San Fran
cisco representatives of the California
iation for the Storat. |
Waters arrived in Los Angeles this after
noon. The visitors are William Thomas,
W. H. Mills, General J. M. Gleaves. F. J.
Bynames, Hugh Craig, J. A. Filcher, T.
C. Fried lander and F. W. Dohrmann
William Thomas presented the case for
the San Franciscans. In part he said:
â¢Our Idea is to have this State take up
the work :or itself, supplement.;
work done by the Government. The entire
matter is a business proposition, and is
resolved into nothing more than owner
ship of water by the State. Not one cent
of money shall be spent until we know
what the whole thing will cost, and to
this end a survey is proposed to secure
the necessary data."
J. A. Filcher, secretary of the associa
tion, read a printed address to the citi
zens of California, declaring the need for
the conservation of the flood waters of the
State and calling a convention to meet In
San Francisco on November 14 to devise
ways and means to this end.
It was moved and carried that the rep
resentatives present from the Los Angeles
organizations be authorized to select del
egates to the San Francisco convention
after which action the meeting was ad
journed.ADVERTISEMENTS.

PRESIDENT THE GUEST
OF THE MARQUETTE CLUB
Archbishop Ireland Present and Speaks of
the Advent of the Flag in the
Philippine Islands.
CHICAGO, Oct. 7.â Thlrty-flve hundred
men gathered around the tables in the
srea.t banquet hail of the Auditorium to
night at the annual banquet at the M.vr
quette Club. This banquet is a regular
event and although corning at tho same
time as the fall festivities is not distinc
tively a part of it. The festival banquet,
under the auspices of the committee, will
be held Monday nipht.
The guest of honor was PreHident Mc-
Klnley, who sat at a raised table on tho
e^ist side of the hall. On the right of the
President sat Archbishop Ireland of St.
Paul. Others at the table were Secretary
GaÂ»?e, Attorney General Griggs, Post
master General Smith, Secretary Hay,
othÂ«r membere of the President's party
and officers of the Marquette Club. There
wore no special decorations at the ban
quet, a preat mass of roses in front of thi
President being the only display.
It was beyond the appointed time when
President Wickersham, after the remains
of the banquet had been removed, called
the gathering to order and introduced
Addison BaJlard, an old settler of Chicago,
who gave a humorous description of Chi
cago in its early days in speaV-lng of the
sentiment "Old Chicago." He was fol
lowed by Archbishop Ireland, who rose to
speak of "The American Republic." The
Archbishop was given an ovation as he
rose and his speech was an eloquent
tribute to American manhood and to the
republic, which he declared to be "the
best form of organized democracy re
vealed in humanity's history." The Arch
bishop's closing words were:
"With anxious eye and throbbing heart

it. Some say it means In Asia the re
pression of liberty. God forbid. It means
tn Asia the Institution of civil order, bo
that America, to whom the f:\tes of war
have brought the unsought duty of main
taining order in those islands, may Bee
ioid know who are the people of the Phil
ippines, who there have the right to speak

added:
"Now what are these men fighting: for?
Are they fighting a Filipino nation? No.
There la no such thing. There are there ,
sixty different tribles, speaking sixty dlf
ferent languages, and or the3e all but one !
wish to come under tha control of the
United States.
"Are we fighting all this one tribeâ the
Tagalos? No; we are fighting no more
than one-half of this nation. We are !
fighting against the selfish ambition of a
military dictator who has been permitted
to gather all the men In the Island discon- !
tented with Spanish rule and array them
against our Government, while we
wrested the Islands for them from th* I
domination of Spain.
"The title we have to the island of
Luzon is better than our title to Louis
lana or Texas, and it rests upon a higher
duty to humanity."
Senator Fairbanks of Indiana, was the
next speaker. His response to the senti- \
mont "The Present Administration" was
received with great demonstrations of ap- !
proval. James E. Boyd spoke- upon "Re- i
publicanism in the South." President |
YVickorsham then brought the assembly i

speech the President, who was gTeeted
with frantic cheers, said:
"I rise only to express my warm appre
ciation of the affectionate salutation of
the Marquette Club and to say that I
reciprocate it with all my heart.
"You have not only been my friends, '
fnithfu! and unfaltering at all times, but,
what Is of more moment and what Is i
much noblor, you have been at all times
faithful to your country, true to the in
violability of public faith, standing al
ways for honost government and honest
money (applause), and forever standing
for the honor and integrity of the flag
wherever It floats, carried by our soldiers
or our pailors on land or on sea." (Great
applause, lasting for several minutes.)

made by Judge Howland J. Hamlin of |

PRESIDENT'S SPEECH ON A
FAMOUS DEBATING GROUND
GALKSBURG, Til., Oct. 7.-On the ram- j
pus of historic ICnox College, -where.
forty-one years ago, Abraham Lincoln
and Stephen A- Douglas met In one of a i
memorable series of debates to determine
which should occupy a seat in the I'nited
States Senate, President McKlnley and j
Postmaster General Emory Smith this
morning delivered stirring- addresses,
commemorative of the contest between ',
the two great leaders of former days. j
The citizens of Galesburg turned out en
masse to honor the President and the j
members of his Cabinet.
Congressman George "W. Prince wel
comed the President to the Tenth Con
gressional District, and the greeting on
the part of tho people of Illinois was
spoken by General Shelby M. Cullom. The
brief speech of the President was listened
to with the closest attention and punc
uirued throughout its delivery with out
bursts of applause. The President said:
"Mr. Chairman and My Fellow Cltiz-?:is:
The time and place make this meeting
.noinnrable. Forty-one years ago on this
Bpot two mighty leaders representing op
posing ideas contended for ina-uery before
! the tribune of the people. It was a contest
which history wlil n.)t fall to record and
some are yet living to tell of its interest-
Ing- and thrilling story. It has been re
cited around the family fireside until to
the people of Illinois it has become a
household tale, inspiring love of liberty
and devotion to free institutions. Here,
therefore, are sacred memories which will
.âºâ rished by this community for all
time and are permanently incorporated in
iho lite of the nation. Lincoln and Doug
las are inseparably connected with the
public mind. Their association began in
conflict and ended in co-ODeration. They
wert; in antagonism for more than
a generation over the interpreta
tion of the constitution, and were
united at last when the consti
| tution itsolf was assailed. They might
I differ as they did over the meaning <>(
some of its provisions, but when the crisis
came they stood together for Its In
violability and for the inseparability of
the Union it established. The one assert
ed the light of slavery under certain com
ditions to enter tne Territoriesâ the otuer
disputed that right under any conditions;
hut both agreed that the slave power
should not divide the Union. The debato
was national and historical. It com
manded profound attention. It interested
all sections. It was watched with deep
est anxiety by the followers of both. It
was read and studied as no other public
discussion before or since. It presented
the host of two conflicting? schools of
thought. It was epoch-making and marked
an '-;>och in our history. It touched th"
public conscience. It influenced public
thought and purpose. It nimld the issue
Impossible or escape; it could be no
longer avoided or evaded. It united the
friends of liberty as well as those of
slavery. It hastened the 'Irrepressible
conflict.' It was not the beginning of the
agitation, but it carried it into the lives
and homes of the republic, and no issue
is ever rightly settled until It is settled
there. It is no little source of satisfac
tion that upon tho great question present
ed In these debates while Douglas car
ried the Legislature Lincoln had a
majority of the people. The torch of lib
erty was not lighted here, but it flamed
forth with a broader, brighter, bolder
light, as it was lifted up by the strong
arm of Abraham Lincoln.
"Three years â only throe years â inter
vened, and tho debate was removed from
the arena of peaceful dlscuspion to that
of war and carnage. And then Lincoln
and Douglas stood no longer divided,
fiumter wns fired on April 12, 188 L On the
l&th of that month Lincoln Issued his call
for 75.000 troops. The position of Doug
las at this critical juncture was that of
a patriot. Without halting or hesitating
he aligned himself on the side of the
National Government and threw the force
of his great In support of the
executive. Lpon the occasion of his mem
orable visit to Lincoln, immediately aftÂ«r
the first call for volunteers, he dictated
to the representative of the Associated
Press a dispatch In these words:
â¢' 'April 18, 1861.â Senator Douglas called
on the President and had an interesting
conversation on the present condition of
the country. The substance of it was, on
the part of >Ir. Douglas, that while he
was unalterably opposed to the adminis
tration in all its political issues, he was
prepared to fully sustain the President, in
iho exercise of all his constitutional func
tions to preserve the Union, maintain the
Government and defend the Federal capi
tal. A firm policy and prompt action were
necessary. The capital was In danger and
must be defended at all hazards and at
any expense of men and money. He spok?
of the present and future without any
reference to the past.'
"He no longer considered party. His
sole consideration was for his country.
He had no sympathy with our enemies in
the North who openly or secretly coun
seled the dissolution of the Union. He
was for the flag, and for its cause and the
brave men -who carried it had his blessing
and prayers. His patriotic course wan a
mighty factor in molding Union sentiment
and in uniting the patriotism of the
country and should serve as an example
of good citizenship and an inspiration to
duty.
"Though Douglas espoused a cause
(loomed to defeat, yet his name Is cher
ished by patriots everywhere, because
when the test came he was found sup
porting the Government and advising his
followers to uphold the constituted au
thorities. It Is the cause which lives and
it Is the cause which makes the men iden
tified with It Immortal In history. Lin
coln was the leader of the triumphant
cause. Douglas, though opposed to him
for a lifetime, supported and strength
ened his arm. Both will be remembered
longest, not for the debate, but for their
part in the mighty events which ensued.
They will live because the Union which
was saved and the liberty which was es
tablished will endure to perpetuate their
names.
"To Lincoln, who In 1858 was strngr
rllng here apalnst the encroachment of
slavery, not for Its destruction where It
existed, but against the further exten
sion, was finally given by the people un
der the providence of God the opportuni
ty and the power to enthrone liberty in
every part of the republic."
Then followed the oration of the day by
Postmaster General Smith. Mr. Smith's
eloquent/tributes to the character ana
service of both Lincoln and Douglas and
his reminiscences of old days in the Illi
nois political arena were much appre
ciated by the Immense crowd of listeners,
some of whom had been among the audi
ences which in 1858 witnessed the polemic
j warfare between the great emancipator
and the champion of popular sovereignty.
At the conclusion of the exercises short
ly before noon the Presidential party
boarded the train for Chicago.
JOLIET, 111., Oct. 7.â A pleasant inci
dent of the stop at La Salle was the pre
sentation to Mrs. McKinley of some beau
tiful flowers by a group of little girls.
The President was Introduced to an im
mense crowd at La Salle by Senator Cul
lom. He spoke as follows:
"I never journey through the East or
the South or the West that my pride ;n
my country is not increased. My love of
it is enhanced and my confidence in its
noWe mission and its permanence firmly
I re-established in my heart. We are a na
| tion of seventy-five millions of people, all
i of thftm possessing equal opportunities In
I the race of life, with public schools and
other schools open for the education of
the boys and the girls freely and without
! pride; with hope put in the heart of the
I humblest boy in the land, and the right
, of that boy to aspire to the highest place
.in the gift of this free republic. And If
j you needed any example of the glorious
opportunities of American citizenship,
! you have them here in your own great
I State of Illinois. Lincoln, Douglas, Lo
' gan, Lovejoy, Oglesby and a long list be
. sides, coming from the humblest walks of
i life at last reached the highest summits
'of fame and fnvor In the republic. And
now to us, for this government rests upon
the people, and all the people, is commit
ted this great fabric of government. Shall
I we maintain it in its Integrity? (Prolonged
I applause and cries of '^es.") Let your
I boys and mine be educated in patriotism.
j and If so educated no harm can befall the
j republic."
At Ottawa, the next stop. President Mc-
Kinley spoke as follows:
"My fellow-citizens: I very much appre
ciate the fact that at this busy period so
many of you have left your accustomed
occupations and assembled here to give
ime welcome and cheer. I rejoice at your
; prosperity. I re.ioice at the prosperity
! which is everywhere observed through
: out our country, and I wish for you and
I all the people continued blessings under
a government which we love and believe
is the beat in the world."

WHAT BRITONS THINK OF
OUR POLICY IN THE EAST
BOSTON, Oct. 7.â Senator George Prls
bie Hoar, who has spent the summer In
Kurope, arrived to-day on the Canada,
When asked what the British, as a rule,
think of our policy in the East, Senator
Hoar replied abruptly:
"They think we are making big asses
of ourselves, but are very anxious that
we shall do it. They think that it is an
abandonment of our old attitude regard
ing the question of public liberty and the
taking up of theirs, and that we are not
doing it well. But it is very easy for a
man traveling abroad to get in a plane of
sentimtm that agrees with his own."
Senator Hoar said he had never heard
an Englishman speak in private with
anything but amusement at our attitude.
"They think It to their advantage,"
he added, "to have us in the East mak
ing a league of otiier nations against
them impossible."
Being pressed as to his personal vlew3
In the matter. Senator Hoar said he be
lieved the feeling of regret was strength
ening that we did not make the treaty
provisions relating to the Philippines like
those which relate to Cuba.
"It seemed to me at the time," said he,
"and all my reflections since has con
firmed me in this opinion, that if we had
precisely the same provisions In the
treaty as regarda the Philippines as wÂ«
have in regard to Cuba we should have
had no war. Instead of a lasting enmity,
we should have had the undying gratitude
of that people. We should have aided
them in keeping order, and there would
have been a new nation in the East, dif
fering from Japan, in fact it would have
been a republic, and we should have had
the glory forever of having been their lib
erators and benefactor*.
"Undoubtedly the Republican party is
attached to the President. Ha deserves
the attachment. Republicans desire to
sustain his .administration. They do not
lind anything attractive in the alternative
of Mr. Bryan. They hope when Con
gress meets some solution of this C'ffl
culty may still be found upon which the
President, Congress and all lovers of lib
erty among the people may stand to
gether."

Its Golden Jubilee.
SAN JOSE, Oct. 7.â The First Presby
terian Church of this city began the
golden jubilee celebration of Its organiza
tion to-day, it having been organized Oc
tober 7, 1849. The edifice was beautifully
decorated and there was a large attend
ance both in the afternoon and evening:
Dr. Dinsmore, the pastor, presided. Pa
pers on the history of the church were
read by Mrs. M. H. Field and Rev. Dr.
yesterday with 105 sick and 100 discharged
men. The Garonna will sail to-day, and
the Indiana will sail to-morrow with tha
Tennessee troops. General Otis says:
"The Indiana was sent south early in
September to collect the Tennessee regi
ment at Iliolo, in Cebu. She picked up a
portion at Iloilo, and then proceeded to
Cebu, where the regiment volunteered Its
services to assist to drive off the insur
gents from the mountains near that city.
The services were accepted by General
Snyder, and the insurgents were over
whelmingly defeated, the Tennessee men
taking a prominent part. They then re
embarked at Cebu, reaching- this harbor
on th elst inst. They were detained to
complete the necessary discharge papers
and will sail in the Indiana to-morrow."
REINFORCEMENTS SENT
TO ADMIRAL WATSON
WASHINGTON, Oct 7.â "Four addi
tional men-of-war have been ordered to
join your fleet, four more will be ordered
next week, and four more the week after
if it Is found necessary." This is the
substance of a cablegram sent to Rear
Admiral Watson by the Navy Depart
ment. Dissemination of this news,
i coupled with the additional information
that Admiral Dewey heartily supports the
President in his purpose to crush the re
bellion â¢will, the authorities believe, have
a very wholesome effect upon the Fili
pino army.
! Official information received here shows
i that Aguinaldo has been keeping a large
I number of malcontents in check by as-
Hurlnsj them that Admiral Dewey was the
j friend of the Filipinos and that when he
j reached Washington his influence would
; suffice to bring about arbitration. Ad
i miral Dewey himself knew of this talk,
j and in his first interview with the Presi
â  dent made it plain that he fully agreed
with the chief executive that a sound
thrashing of the rebels was necessary in
order to secure an early peace in the
Philippines, and that the islands should
Ibe permanently held by the United
' States. When it becomes generally known
to the insurgents that Admiral Dewey in
dorses the administration policy the au
thorities, including the admiral, expect
I that Aguinaldo's army will become so
demoralized that surrender will be in
', evitable.
Babb. This evening there was a social
and reception. The Second Presbyterian
Church is joining in the celebration. To
morrow will be the principal day. In the
morning Dr. Minton, a former pastor,
will preach. At l.oon the Sunday-school
will hold anniversary exercises and at 7:30
o'clock there will be a special song ser
vice and addresses by several ministers.

causes of a sound currency and of a
stable standard of value when it means
bo much to our common country. It is
evidently the plan of those conducting
the Democratic campaign to Ignore for
the time being the money question and
distract the attention of the people from
what is so vital to their happiness and
prosperity. But these tactics are but a
shield to cover the real purpose, which
is to secure the ultimate triumph of the
doctrine of sixteen to one in this country.
"I predict that a Republican Congress
will legislate at the approaching session
bo as to Increase the confidence of the
people, establish firmly the Bold standard
of the civilized world and let the people
know that all of their obligations will be
discharged on a safe and firm basis, mak
ing contracts to pay the laborer, to pay
the inner and to pay the pensioner, and
to pay for every product of this country,
stable only on a just and fair basis,
admitting of no doubt or uncertainty as
to the adjustment between man and man.
It will be seen, therefore, that while the
Democratic party is still trying to destroy
the money of the people the Republican
party is ever on the alert to protect it
and their sacred interests. My country
men, do you -want a change? Are you dis
satisfied with the management of affairs
under McKinley and Republican legisla
tion?
"Under our modern civilization and
throughout the world capital is helpless
without labor. Labor is helpless without
capital. It is the combination of capital
and labor which gives the great poten
i tial force which we are considering.
I Whatever legislation is passed should
keep both partners in the combination
steadily and firmly in view.
"There Is not a single foundation for
the statement that there is an alliance
between the United States and England.
The man who makes that charge is either
densely ignorant or willfully wicked.
There is absolutely no proof of such an
alliance and one has never been contem
i plated by the administration or any man
i in this country outside of an insane asy
| lum. This country needs no alliance- with
I England or with any other nation, nor
| have we any interests that can be ad
vanced by any such alliance. The United
States has hewn, can and will how. out
its own great and mighty destiny with
out an alliance with any other nation
upon earth. I hope and believe, that the
i citizens of the United States who hail
from Germany or from Ireland will in
every way rebuke this attempt to play
j upon their prejudices and to discredit
their intelligence.
"Why don't these gentlemen who com
plain about the Philippines also give
I vent to their indignation about our hold
ing Porto Rico and the Isle of Pines and
Guam? Does it require a rebellion to
point out a right or a duty? Ah, gentle
! men, who are pressing yourselves in the
, pathway of civilization, are you honest
I with us, with yourselves?- Do you know
I that Porto Rico Guam, the home of pi
-1 rates, and the Philippines each and all
of them will within a few years be like
j new worlds in the presence of the influ
ences of the United States and the civ
! ilization which is flowing Into each and
all of them? . .â  t '
"Nothing will prevent me or any Amer
ican citizen in the hereafter from listen
ing with open ears and glad hearts to the
appeal of those islands for the highest
form of liberty when their progress and
advancement indicate that they are ripe
for and capable of a larger liberty, and
until such time shall come, and that is
far in the future, the Philippine Islands,
being ours of right, must not be surren
dered to any earthly power. Do the pres
ent and growing interests of this republic
command us to run from these acquisi
tions which destiny has forced upon us?
j In my opinion the great market of the
I future for the United States will be Asia.
Already the quickening trade with that
region is manifest. Undoubtedly the Phil
ippine I3lande are a rich Held for trade
and are full of promise for the future
under the protection of i a government
which will protect life and the oppor
tunity for honest effort. v
"Under the American policy of protec
tion we are not only able, to feed and
| clothe and supply most of our own wants
but we are rapidly reaching a point in
our development when we must reach out
I more ana more to supply the wants of
other countries. Every thinker sees this
:to be our futnrÂ« destiny. Our. welfare
points in that direction. Without violat

sibilities are upon US, opportunities are
1 with us, and it only remains to be seen,
: whether we will fail our country in meet
ing these grand opportunities, when in
; doing so we will not only bless our own !
people but carry blessings into other
i lands. Let us not run from our clear
duty. Let us not run from the true in
terests of our people. Let us not run
from the higher command, which orders
I us to aid in the civilization and advance

Just returned from the reindeer expedition
tv Siberia in the revenue cutters Bear and
Thistle. He said this evening:
"We did not increase our own herds this
year by purchase. "We bought reindeer
to replace those borrowed last year and
which were so successfully used in going
t<> the rescue in the winter of 1537-9 X of the
whalers imprisoned In the ice off Point
Barrow. This Is also tin same occasion
on which Mr. John D. Spr^kels, proprie
tor of the San Francisco Call, gave such
a handsome sum of money in fitting out a
ship to go to the rescue of the whalers.
We bought over 7<'O in one place and over
300 in another, making over 1000 In all,
which we returned deer for deer. Some of
them â¢ "h. If ttiere is a failure of
a reindeer exnedl'ion or purchase we are
always certain to hear of It, but if there
Is a slgniticant success very little Is said
about it. 1 cite the great work of the
n scue of the Point Harrow whalers,
where hundreds of these animals traveled
day after day for weeks and found their ;
own food by the way. Reindeer as fat as
butter have furnished Juicy steaks at i
Cape Nome. The Swedish Evangelical
Mission last winter used Ita herd in pack
ing merchandise, outfits, etc., around by
the shore from St Michael to Cape Nome
and cleared over {2000, 1 believe.
"The peopleâ or a large part of them â are
skeptical of the reindeer in the Arctic
and lower latitudes of this country be
cause they don't know the facts. After a
while will com.- the awakening. They
laugh at me now; it will then be my turn
to laugh, if I want to. But I am pleased
nowâ pleased with the reindeer experi
ment, so culled, for it Is a success.
"The United States Government lias had
men all over Alaska since 1892â for nearly
eight vcars- looking into the matter nf
reindeer moss. It is found almost every

some places on the coast. Why, I saw
some growing in the military yard at
Dyea when 1 was there last year. The
caribou is nothing but a wild reindeer.
!!â¢â¢ iiv^s on the same vegetable matter
that the reindeer does. Everybody knows
that great herds of caribou roam the in

and grow fat in winter, don't they.'"

with the Pyramid Harbor failure. lie

When the subject of the hot report of
the last United States Grand Jury <>n the

SOME DISCORD
IS AHEAD FOR
THE ADMIRAL
Dewey and Crowninshield
Do Not Speak as They
Pass By.
Head of the Bureau of Navigation of
the Navy Department Not For
given by Hero of Manila Bay.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLING
TON HOTEL, -WASHINGTON, Oct. 7.-
Conjecture as to Admiral Dewey's future
seems popular just now. Some of those
who have been most eager, to define it for
him have already created a new office and
have appointed him to the position of offi
cial counselor to ', the Secretary of the
Navy. Nothing of this sort has even been
considered by the Navy Department. But
those who know Dewey doubt very much
if he will consent to accept any duty
which will put him in the position of the
administration's advisory counsel on na
val matters.
It is understood in naval circles that
Dewey may not find official connection
with the department altogether pleasant
Just at this time. ! If he is to be in the
department at all he will, of course, be
referred to above all others. But this
will be far from agreeable to Admiral
Crowninshield, head of the Bureau of
Navigation, who ever since the beginning
of the present administration has been a
power in the department, subject only to
the supervision of the Secretary. Any
change in present conditions would be dis
tasteful to P him. He would chafe under
the restraint if another officer were to
enter the department and assume some of
the duties which he has been accustomed
to exercise. Dewey's supremacy in par
ticular, would be apt to lead up to un
pleasant results, for Crowninshield is one
of the few officers in the navy not person
ally on friendly terms Â» when
Crowninshield was overridden jnen
Dewey was sent to command the Asiatic
sÂ£sr Â«.â ?Â«, ft ssSsSe
day to this the two men have had no re
lations. After the battle or Manila
Crow^nshield sent Dewey an effusive let
ter of 'congratulation. Dewey ignored t.
There have been other efforts at reconcili
ation on crowninshield's part but .Dewey
has paid no attention to them, The two
men will probably never come together in
a friendly way, for Dewey Is one who
?W p 0 r O sors 0r o g f 1 Dewey in the office
of admiral of the navy experienced no
trouble with the Bureau of Navigation.
While Farragut was admiral the chiefs
of the Bureau of Navigation were Rear
Admiral T. A. Jenkins, from August 1565
until April. 1869, who was succeeded by
Rear Admiral James Alden The latter
was the personal friend of President
Grant and Secretary Robeson of the navy,
and while there was no love lost between
Alden and Farragut the former did not in
any manner interfere with the admiral.
The petty annoyances to which he was
subjected came from Vice Admiral Por
ter who for some time was the de facto
Secretary of the Navy. Porter became
admiral on the death of Farragut on Au
gust 10 ISTO. The Bureau of Navigation
was for a number of years a power for
good or evil in the hands of its chief, for
the assignment of officers afloat or ashore
was the principal function of that bureau,
but the Bureau of Yards and Docks had
in reality more power, as its chief be
came Secretary pro tern, during the ab
sence of the civil head of the navy. The
powers Of the two bureaus mentioned
have however, been greatly curtailed
since' a civilian Assistant Secretary has
been appointed, and with the introduc
tion of a civil engineer as chief of the
1 Bureau of Yards and Docks this branch
of the Navy Department has lost Its for
! mer prestige and power.
In the absence of the Secretary and the
â  Assistant Secretary the chief of the Bu
reau of Navigation succeeded to a tem
i porary regency, which, however, is al
ways brief, and the orders emanating
from its chief are subject to approval of
the higher civilian heads. It is no longer
the terror to officers it was under Alden,
Arnmcn and Walker, and no chief of that
bureau, however envious he might be of
the admiral, has it in his power to make
It disagreeable lor that distinguished of
ficer. The duties (if the latter will be such
as he may be assigned to directly by the
Secretary of the Navy; the admiral is the
1 first of the naval officers on the list, and
he is preceded only by the civil heads of
i the navy. It is not likely that Dewey will
DR. KILMER'S SWAMP ROOT.
DO YOU GEfir
WITH A LAME BACK ?
Do You Have Rheumatism ?
Are You Sleepless, Irritable, All Run Down ?
Kidney Trouble Makes You Miserable.
SWAMP-ROOT is the Great Remedy for Kidney.
Bladder and Uric flcid Troubles. To Prove
for Yourself Its Wonderful Merits, You May
Have a Sample Bottle Sent FREE by Mail.
You are in no danger of being sick if
you keep your kidneys well.
They filter your blood and keep it
pure and free from disease-breeding
germs.
Your other organs may need care, but
your kidneys most, because they do
most.
If you are sick, begin with your kid-
neys, because as soon as they are well
they will help all the other organs to
health.
The treatment of some diseases may
be delayed without danger, not so with
kidney disease.
Swamp- Root is the great medical tri-
umph of the nineteenth century; dis-
covered after years of untiring effort
and research by the eminent kidney
and bladder specialist, Dr. Kilmer, and
has truly wonderful healing action on
the kidneys and bladder.
It will be found by both men and
women just what is needed in all cases
of kidney and bladder disorders, lame
back, dull pain or ache in the back,
gravel, catarrh of the bladder, rheu-
matism, sciatica, neuralgia, uric acid
troubles and Brighfs disease, which is
the worst form of neglected kidney
trouble.
If your water when allowed to remain
undisturbed In a glass or bottle for
twenty-four hours forms a pediment or
experience any difficulty with either Long
or Allen; they are apparently in thorough
! sympathy and accord; and there is no ;
likelihood of a repetition of Porters de
feat in his engagement with the Irascible \
Secretary Chandler. Admiral Porter al- j
â¢ways chafed under the restraint imposed
by tli' presence in the navy <>f a civilian
as Secretary. His recommendations re- j
ceived but 'scant attention and he was t
I frequently snubbed. Porter had offices In
the same buiUUnp. hut some distance :
I away from those of the Secretary of the
! Navy, and the latter, with a retlnement of
| cruelty, determined to put Porter in a
I position where he would be made to real- I
lse that a civilian ruled the navy. One
nvirTiinK when Porter came into his ofHee
he found a workman busy putting in an !
electric wire and other accessories to a
telegraph call from the Secretary's office. ;
Porter was disgusted and swore that he
waÂ« no lob-lolly boy nor lackey, and that
the Secretary might ring- and be blowed,
but that he would not stir in obeilience to
! a summons of that kind. In due time the
! call bell was in working order and soon ,
' after its ting-a-ling indicated that the :
â  Secretary desired Admiral Porter to come
! to his office. The old salt scowled at the
i offending bell, made some irrelevant re-
I marks unfit for publication andâ hurried I
as fa.st as he could to Secretary Chand- j
ler"s office. It was hard but necessary
treatment, and there is not the remotest j
j cause of apprehending a similar incident j
to be possible with such men as Long,
Allen and Dewey, and the otherg don't
count. __ - __^_______

James Clarke, a prominent attorney, was i
convicted here last night, after a five
weeks' trial, ot" being an accessory to the
murder of W. C, Hoy.l a year apo last

murder because he objected to Boyd'fl at

swore that Clarke, who was his attorney, ;
advised the murder and furnished the I
weapon. CUrke was convicted <>n this
testimony several weeks ago, but the Su- !

I ground that Postlethwalte, who was a i
convict, was incompetent to testify. In i

Swamp- Root has been tested in so
many ways, in hospital work, in private

BERLIN CONGRESS
American Geographers
Are Criticized.
Copyrighted, 1898, by the Associated Press.
BERLIN, Oct. 7.â Public opinion has
been much more deeply engrossed this
week In following the proceedings of the
International Geographical Congress and
the sensational developments of the trial
of the persona accused of gambling at the
Club dor Harinlosen than with the Trans
vaal situation, although South African
affairs are being followed by keen solici
tude by the Government and political
men. There was considerable comment
among the delegates to the Congress, as
welJ as on the part of the public, during
the sittings regarding the relatively un
important share taken by the United
States. While the whole body of dele
gates numbered some 1300, those from the
United States were fewer than a dozen,
of whom General Greely, though repre
senting the United States Government,
did not present a paper and took only an
Insignificant part in the transactions.
Major H. X. Alien, attache of the United
biates Embassy, who was an official dele
gate, was too busy In making his prep
arations to return home to devote himself
to tile business of the congress.
Arthur C. Jackson, the explorer, and
Professor Ross, of New York did not put
in an appearance, while Marcus Bauer
only appeared at the last moment. Pro
fessor Davis of Harvard University was
obliged to leave in the very miast of the
proceedings. With the exception of the
paper of Mrs. Zelia Nuttal, which was
presented in the choicest German, and
that of Poultney Bigelow on "Colonial
Administration," which contained some
startling assertions, there was no strik
ing American feature throughout the sit
ting.
It Is largely due to this that the next
congress will not meet In Washington, as
Proressor Bryant of Philadelphia pro
posed. His suggestion was not backed up
â¢with any vigor nor by the requisite num
ber of delegates. Among its supporters
the Americans, half of whom were women,
â¢were quite lost. Several members criti
cized the fact that the United States did
not present a report of the doings of the
Hydrographic Omce, especially regarding
Its unrivaled polar charts, which are the
best of their kind in the world, and about
â which the congress had been anxious to
hear. The expectation was that a detailed
report on this subject would be the feat
ure of the American share in the proceed
ings. The Americans, however, partici
pated fully In the social attentions shown
the congress.
The sensational trial of the Club der
Harmlosen has stirred, fashionable and
sporting circles to the very depths.
A peculiar feature of the case Is that
come of the witnesses belong to the im
mediate entourage of Emperor William.
Moreover, officers of garrisons all over
the empire and many who belong to the
guard regiments are implicated, as well
as experts on the correct way of playing
baccarat, and men of the highest fashion,
like Count yon Henventlow of the Union
Club.
There was considerable difficulty in get
ting the experts to appear. One of the
most notorious gambling houses in Ber
lin, when asked to furnish experts, re
plied that this was impossible, as its
members were not allowed to gamble.
Many important witnesses were absent.
Some excused themselves on the ground
that they had gone bear hunting in Nor
way or were about starting for Africa for
a > ear, or had sudden illness. Others, like
Lieutenant yon Schrader, committed sui
cide, or like Count yon Stosh and Baron
yon Nelmps fled to the United States. Two
prominent men of the club. Count Eglof
stein and Count yon Kusserow, arÂ« ac
cused of defalcations.
Wolff, the founder of the club, has n-.nÂ«
to parts unknown. It was proved that
he had been convicted of theft and had
served a term in prison, although most of
the witness asserted that he was a man
of excellent demeanor and perfect man
ners, whence his nickname "Gentleman
Wolff." Count Flatten, although his evi
dence would have been of the most im- !
portant character, was excused from tes- !
tifying. General yon Kroech, father of
one of the defendants, the commander of
an my corps and an intimate adviser
of Emperor William, refused to appear.
His sun admitted that he had been guilty
of fleecing-.
In well informed army circles it is as- '
serted that Emperor William not only
wants the matter thoroughly sifted but
Intends that the trial shall be followed by !
an extensive weeding out of gamblers and j
otherwise undesirable officers. It is as
serted that there are 270 of this stripe
quartered In sixteen garrisons who will
come within the category of offenders.

MASCAREL LEFT
TWO FAMILIES
Contest Promised Over
His Estate.
Special I>lÂ«pÂ»tch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 7.â By the death
of the old-timer, Jose Mascarel, once
Mayor, and for two terms a member of
the City Council of this place when it
was still a struggling adobe pueblo, the
courts again will be called upon to settle
the vexed question of plural marriages,
rights of heirs who may or may not
rightly have called him father, and to
accord the peal of wifehood to some wo
man who row does not s^em to bear it.
As is usual in BUch rases the male actor
in the domestic drama left a large for
tune. When the value of the estate of
the house of Mascarel is established it
will bo found to run toward one million,
and of this amount one hundred thous-ana
is in cash in tho I. W. Hellman banking
house, known as the Farmers' and Mer
chants' Bank.
i.'arel hailed from the south ot
France, and as a sailor drifted into this
.-<Â» tlon fifty years ago, never quitting the
old home for a day. Mascarel invested in
rcaJ estate and cattle, bought, trafficked
and sold, became wealthy and figured as
an active stockholder in the Hellman
bank. He married in this country and his
known heirs are a wife and three children
by a former marriage and a flock 01
bairns estimated at a baker's dozen. All
of these reside in Los Angeles.
Added to this record Is the link in the
Mascarel chain that Is found in the south
of France in the form of a wife and chil
dren whom he left to find a new home in
the new world.
The dead ex-Mayor will bo burled on
Monday, the ceremonies being held in the
at Plaza Church, but even now, aa
these facts have been known for a score
of years, lawyers are preparing the pa
pers that shall divide the remnants of a
me among heirs if possible and surely
among themselves.
STIRRED UP A NEST
OF RATTLESNAKES
Workman at Schuetzen Park Has a
Lively Battle and Narrowly
Escapes Being Bitten.
PAN RAFAEL, Oct. 7.â While four
workmen were engaged in digging a
trench for the new gravity outfall sewer
system near Schuetzen Park to-day they
invaded a nest of rattlesnakes and in a
twinkling had seven of the poisonous rep
tiles crawling and hissing around their
feet. Three of the men fled, leaving
"Jack" Smith behind, who seised a shovel
and started in to kill the snakes.
Though he managed to exterminate
them all. Smith narrowly escaped being
n by one huge specimen, which
struck at him twice, on one occasion fas-
S its fangs in his rubber boots. This
the last killed, had eighteen rat
tles, and was nearly four feet long. The
oldest settlers here state that this is the
first instance in which they ever heard
of a rattlesnake inhabiting the marsh re
gion around San Rafael.

>n in the matter which Is in favor

to Â«et up a revolutionary government and cherish an

upon then our birthright in a government by consent,
and there was neither protest nor resistance on their
part. Mr. Blame, who will be accepted by the Her
ald as good Republican authority, said: "At this day,
when the right of people to govern themselves, the
fundamental basis of republican institutions, is so
widely recognized, nothing is more difficult or more
dangerous than the forced transfer of territory, car
rying with it an indignant and hostile population.
The Government of the United States believes that
territorial changes should be avoided as far a>
possible and that they should never be the result of
mere force."
The Mexicans on this territory were neither indig
nant nor hostile. The Herald will observe that Mr.
Blame was guilty of using the same "demagogic hal
lucination and political makeshift" as Mr. Short.
As it has answered Mr. Short so successfully, will it
now proceed to refute Blame's position?
The whole history of our Government confirms the
that Blame took, that "such territorial changes
should never be the result of mere force." The rea-
Republican institutions can in the
nature of things be propagated only by example and
consent. Monarchical and despotic institutions can
not be propagated by example and consent, and -o
have always depended upon force. Therefore it is
difficult to differentiate a republic from a despotism
when it abandon* example and consent and resorts
to force.

FINANCIAL LEGISLATION.
"T~*HE San Francisco Chronicle antagonizes, with
some asperity, the proposition to have any
financial legislation at the coming session of
Congress. Its ?ir.-t reason is that "what one Con
gress can do another can undo," and, secondly, that
'as long as we maintain our present tariff system we
shall be all right."
As the existing tariff is nothing but legislation by
one Congress and another may undo it. it would
seem that there is a flaw somewhere in the Chronicle
logic.
The Republican '/arty came into power in 1896 to
do two thingsâ reform the currency, establish
Â«ound finance and pass protective tariff. The mem
ory of men run- easily back to the campaign of that
year and recalls the pledge for sound money and the
g'>]<! standard n ade on every stump and in every Re
lican paper between the ocean-. Each pledge
made by the party had tÂ«> be redeemed by legislation.
but-' â  hronicle is that neither should
have bee!! redeemed, because "what one Congress
can do anothei can undo." Therefore ; - Re
publican \:i both branchi â . should not do anything to
carry out part) â¢ â¢ I 1 .- ause it will not
be a finality and may be undone by another Congress.
In this country parties struggle for supremacy and
power in ;' â  ' solely for the purpose of
impressing their policy upon its legislation and ad
ministration. According to the Chronicle idea it is
usele*< to add anything to the legislation of the first
â  [789 because subsequent Congresses
wouid undo it!
The Chronicle says there is a growing feeling that
"it is inexpedient to precipitate a debate on the sub
ject of monetary reform at a time when all of the best
arguments of those who are advocating the necessity
of an immediate recognition of the gold standard can
be refuted by the presentation of a few facts."
These facts are stated to be the balance of ti
our favnr and plenty of gold in the country. The
Arkansas traveler found a man with no roof on h'.s
house who excused himself for not putting one on by
the presents few facts. The-e were that when
it rained lie couldn't put on a roof, and when it did
not rain nn roof was needed. It was raining from
:Bq.> to iB</i. The panic was on and it was found
to be impossible to secure the treasury against the
depletion of the endless chain and to protect the pub
lic credit by efficient recognition of the gold stan
dard. The necessity for doing both was clearly seen,
but neither could be done, and the result was the load
ing the people with the burden of an interest charge,
tens of millions greater than it should be, to prevent
public insolvency. The panic is over now. Times are
good. There is abroad a tendency to speculative in
flation, and the conditions are such as lead to panics.
The wise man in private business looks ahead and
secures his credit against what may come. A wise
Government should do the same. To definitely ac
cept the gold standard and entrench it in the law and
the treasui -t another depleting run is
to be wise. But in this situation the Chronicle ad
:e Republican party to adopt Arkansas
economics and finance and not precipitate a discus
sion of governmental wisdom!
- m it- outstanding pledge the party owes i f
to the country t . well and wisely toward a
more sound, safe and scientific system of public
finance, a= it owe- to the country good and wise, gov
ernment in all things. No doubt the Republicans
who â .vere shouting for free silver up to the holding
of the National Convention, and who despaired of
success when Teller. Stewart, Jones, Dubois and the
silver Republicans bolted at St. Louis have yet in
their political veins the septic influence which induced
hundreds of thousands like them to swell Mr. Bryan's
vote. But there are others. The victory of 1806 was
a distinct triumph for the sound money men of the
country. These are now sneered at by the Chronicle
a* "alleged monetary reformers."
But in their ranks are such eminent Republicans as
ex-Senator Edmunds, Stuart Patterson, Colonel
Higginson. 11. H. HSnna, Secretary of the Treasury
Gage. Governor Shaw, and the leaders in all the
States of the Upper V Valley, who have re
covered or held their States from I'ryanarchy by de
manding just what the Chronicle says they should not
have.
The very fact that a change may occur in the par
tisan majority, which the Chronicle admits when it
:''ir non-action, is a reason for action carried
as far as it can po-sibly go without getting out of
sight of public opinion. It is hardly possible that the
country will elect a President who would sign a bill
to substitute the silver basis for the gold standard.
But under the declaratory resolution of the last Con
gress under existing law such basis would be reached
when the strain on the treasury made it necessary to
redeem public obligations in silver.
Preventive legislation now will empower a Presi
dential veto to protect the public credit against any
thing but a two-thirds majority in Congress

RESULTS OF THE TRUST CONFER
ENCE.
JOHN BATES CLARK, professor of political
economy at Columbh University, who was one
of the delegates to \\:r Chicago Trust Confer
ence, has recently made public his opinion concerning
the results accomplished by the discussion. Like the
rest of the world, he regards the work of the confer
ence as valuable only so far as it was educational, and
notes that it deserves to be considered satisfactory,
inasmuch as it gave the public an opportunity to
learn the best arguments current on the two sides of
the great issue.
According to the professor, some of the most ear
re-t students on the subject at the conference took
no part in the debates. He quotes one of them as
saying. "I have been soaking in public opinion."
That was probably the condition of the professor
himself, for he has drawn from the discussion only
! the most conservative of views, and comments upon
I the problem with no little caution.
Judging from what wr.Â« brought forth at the con
ference, Professor Clark says that as a rule the oppo
nents of trusts are the small capitalists and the agri
culturists. He notes that the small body of social
ists in the country look upon trusts with favor in the
belief that their tendency will be to educate the gen
eral mass of men in the economic, advantage of large
combination*. Speaking for himself he says: "We
can crush trusts if we really decide to do it. but we
can do something that is better than that, for we can
study the natural forces that are already working
i against true monopoly, and by removing the obstacles
that are in their way preserve, in spite of vast con-
solidations of capital, the principle of competition
and freedom."
Such a conclusion seems to be amply justified by
all the facts thus far made known. Of course trusts
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY. OCTOBER 8. 1899.
being a? yet in but an early stage of their development
it is not possible to perceive clearly in what they will
help and in what injure the world of industry and
commerce. A careful supervision to remedy abuses
is all that is needed at this time. There is nothing
to afford a foundation for a fear that any possible
combination of capital can ever effect a monopoly of
a considerable industry in a nation so large as the
United States, if individual enterprise be left free to
combat it.
James W. Girvin, formerly of San Francisco, now
of Hawaii, has a double whose affairs are constantly
being mixed with his. This alter ego always turned
up where the original James W. was expected, in
variably managing to get there first. The only satis
faction the present sufferer has is the hope that the
other fellow will answei the rollcall when his own
time on earth is up.
THE MUNICIPAL CAMPAIGN.
nC) RACK DAVIS in addressing the convention
upon his nomination for the office of Mayor
very clearly vet forth in a few words the issue
of the contest and his own relation to it. His state
ment merits the attentive consideration of all voters,
for it contains at once a declaration of the policies
which should now he pursued by the municipal ad
ministration, and a pledge to undertake them with
fidelity and zeal. '
Mr. Davis said: "The position of Mayor of San
Francisco is at all times one of responsibility, but
this year it is more responsible than ever. We have
come to the parting of the ways, where the city shall
cast off its swaddling clothes and come out into the
grace and majesty of civic maturity. Your platform
sets forth the principles upon which you ask and have
a right to expect the support of the people. I accept
the responsibility imposed upon the nominee for
May->r by that platform. I am in favor of and have
had some experience in the work of municipal re
form. I had the honor to preside over a preliminary
convention looking to the framing of the new charter,
and I participated in several ratification meetings, be
lieving that the charter opened to us a new era for
municipal reform. I shall endeavor, if elected, to
carry out its provisions faithfully and honestly."
From that short but comprehensive statement the
voters of the city can learn the nature of the issue
before them. San Francisco under its new charter is
about to enter upon a new era of progress, provided
the incoming administration be one devoted to muni
cipal improvement on lines of true economy and be
in the hands of men in whom the people have enough
of confidence to give warm and genuine support.
The character of the men who compose the tickets
of the rival parties constitutes, therefore, a potent
factor in the campaign. There cannot be a good
administration except in the hands of men who are
not only honest but who are upheld by the better
elements of the community, and are not in any way
allied or in collusion with the old bosses and their
gangs of tax-caters who in the past have been so per
nicious to our politics.
Mr. Davis is himself one of the most eminent men
who has ever consented to serve an American muni
cipality in the office of Mayor. He has had a dis
tinguished career both in public and in private life.
At every period of his manhood he has taken a warm
interest in the larger affairs of the city, the State and
the nation, and in all disputed issues before the people
has always been on the right side. He was one of the
â¢ to perceive the danger to California in unre
ted immigration of Chinese, and was foremost in
making the fight against it at home and in Congress.
That is but one incident in a long career of public
service, but it reveals the foresight and genuine pa
triotism of the man, his careful regard for the inter
ests of labor and the general welfare of all. .
It is to be noted, moreover, that the whole ticket
is strong. The candidates for the various judicial
positions and municipal and county offices are all
excellent. The city has in the past had experience
with a Board of Supervisors virtually selected by
Mayor Phelan, and the result of the experience is still
freshly remembered. The Democratic majority of the
body was so corrupt that even Phelan himself tried
to oust them from office. Since that time a Repub
j lican board has been in office and the party can safely
challenge an inspection of its record. The Repub
licans of the board have fulfilled every pledge they
made and have given the city as good a government
as is possible under a Democratic Mayor animated by
ambitions for another term.
The issue is before the people. The desire of all is
for progress and improvement undertaken in hon
esty and carried out with economy. The Republican
party presents a ticket which assures the fulfillment of
that desire and can with justice claim the support not
only of all its own members but of all independent
voters who have sufficient civic patriotism to seek
the true welfare of the city.

tion of the series of home studies which The
Call has arranged for the fall and winter,
popular interest in them increases. That much is
made evident by the large number of inquTries con
cerning them and by the warm approval given to the
plan by the foremost educators of the State.
These studies, as has been pointed out, will appeal
to even' family and to every member of the family.
The courses are so varied as to afford gratification to
the different mental inclinations of the readers, and
each course is to be contributed by men or women
who are everywhere recognized as established au
thorities on the subjects with which they will deal.
It is certainly to be accounted a gratifying fact that
the readers of The Call are without additional cost
to have the pleasure and the benefit of studying
Shakespeare under the direction of srteh teachers as
Professor Dowden of Dublin University, William J.
Rolfe and others; American history in the form of
life studies of its greatest men, by historians of the
rank of John Bach McMaster and Albert Bushnell
Hart; the great artists of the world and their mas
terpieces by critics of eminence like John C. Van
Dyke and Russell Sturgis: home science under the
instruction of women like Mrs. Helen Campbell. Mrs.
Margaret E. Sangster and their colleagues; and that
the boys and girls of the family are to have the ad
vantage of weekly counsel and education in studies
important to them in the practical affairs of life.
Hardly any feature of the paper will be more im
portant than these studies, and those who look for
ward to them with most expectancy will be fully re
warded.

By all odds the most interesting event
of the past week has been the triumph
ant demonstration of the efficiency of the
telegraphy. It appeals not only
to the reason, but to the imagination. It
peems as If fancy itself could not set
bounds to the potences of the new mar
vpl. To be ablo to direct electric currents
through the air with such certainty as to
compel their services gives to humanity
something of the attribute of a demigod.
There exist recording instruments in the
great observatories of the world of such
c "rlloacy that whenever a spot appears on
the surface of the sun the instruments re
cord a change in the magnetic equilibrium
of the earth. If such records can be ob
tuiiud of what is going on at the vast
distance of tho sun, it is not unreasonable
tÂ«. believe that since we have now tho
iicwer to direct electrical energy without
wires we may yet be able to start a cur
rent at any given point on the globe which
will le recorded by Instruments at any
other point. It Is even possible that here
afte" battles may be reported as the yacht

Out of the popular enthusiasm In the
welcome to Dewey there has come some
thing which promises to be of permanent
aii'l inestimable value to the republic. The
grand triumphal arch erected in his honor
in New York has been found to be so no-
Mo anÂ«l so beautiful that with one accord
the rress. the people, the critics and the
artists urge its perpetuation In enduring

\V( hayÂ« accomplished In this country
so littlf- in the way of pure art that the
very promise of a really fine monumental
I s-tru< ture in the chief city of the country
is ,)lia^;i!b. it might be said of us, with
a fair degrep of truth, that we have pro
duced a trillion books, but no literature,
| and achieved a thousand artisan suc
j cesses without accomplishing art. There
i are scoffers who declare we cannot attain
| to genuine art, and the scoffing hurts a
i little because there la almost as much
; truth In the words as there is spleen In
i the men who utter them. The superb arch
j in New York holds out a hope that wo
â¢ shall have a monumental refutation of
such mockers hereafter.
If New York fail to carry out the In
spiration 'f the time, we might get the
models and raise the arch in marble
here. It wi."] be remembered we have a

i and as many K-ntlomen to dine with him
| after the celebration of the distinguish^;
; nuptials. The most elaborate prepara
tions were made for the feast. The table
was beautifully decorated with flowers of
i pure gold in vases of dec-ply chased sil
i ver, and diamonds were sprinkled about to
! give a pleasing appearance of dewdrop
1 freshness to the petals. The hour came,
the dinner wns ready, the wines were
cooled to the exact temperature that you
get when you pay most for it; but the
guests did nut come. The host, with one
lone friend, a masculine friend at that,
waited and waited. By and by he started
the telephone to going. The ladies re
sponded promptly. They were ready, they
â were waitlnp, but th^ir escorts did not
come. More telephonps failed to rouse
j the escorts, but did bring responses from
] persons having them in charge. The es
corts were all Indisposedâ suffering from
symptoms of blind drunk. About 10 o"clock
the host and his faithful friend essayed
to finish the dinner themselves. They
made but a stagger at the viands, but
j with the wines they got along swim
! mingly, for a time that is, but In the end
were drowned in a sea of champagne and
weni down umW the table lamenting the

A leader of Washington society Is
quot>-ri as having said she knew Dewey
would become a great and famous man
because when a comparatively subordi
nate officer and stationed in that city he
wan never neglectful of social courtesies.
; Evidently the praise was intended to be
i high, and Just for that reason it conveys
an intimation that as a rule the naval
officer in Washington is not noted for
courtesy. It is probable that in their
' cruising about the seas the gallant fel
lows become IndinVrent to the observ
ances expected of educated men by the
American woman. At any rate a lack
I of social courtesy so uniformly marks
' them that a lady of light ami leadership
discerns true genius In any one of thun
who distinguishes himself by actions of
politeness.
The experience of the Washington lady
recalls an Incident in this city. Not long
ago certain ladies went to visit the lowa,
bearing with them a letter of introduction
to the captain from an official of high
rank. The letter was duly taken by an
officer on deck and possibly conveyed to
the captain, but probably to the petty
! officer who commands the apprentices, for
1 an apprentice came tip and showed them
| about the ship. Neither the captain nor
any officer received them, nor spoke to
them, nor sent word to them of excuse or
regret. The letter of introduction was
I ignored as if it had not been. Judging
' by the standard set up by the experl
! enced woman in the national capital there
' are no Deweys on the lowa. The lncl
-1 dent is trifling and goes as it came, but it
! is likely the ladies of Washington may
yet have to exert thflr influence to have
a professorship of manners established
at Annapolis.

The campaigns of off year? are always
dull and those of this particular one are
i duller than ordinarily by reason of the
! fact that the parties having no distinct
fssue to fight over are skirmishing for
positions in a fog and are moving cau
tiously. All the more credit ia therefore
due to Governor Stephens of Missouri
who, not being able to give us an issue,
j has furnished our oratory with a now
phrase. He recently addressed a Missouri
audience as "Sapient sons of sainted

your country are upon you to-day." What

Admiral Dewey is a most excellent ad
miral, an honor to his country, an ideal
popular hero and tin ornament to thn
Dewey family; but the way in which he
is not acting on political issues with the
: vigor he showed in war is a caution to
statesmen. Whenever any one has said
I anything to him about Presidential possi
bilities be has smiled and put the ques
tion by. When told the other day that
the politicians are planning to nominate
him, ho replied, "They don't know me "
To another questioner who asked him if
he were a Democrat he said, "I am going
to whisper a great secret-! don't think
anybody knows my politics."
AM of which may mean nothing. In the
meantime it is to be remembered that in
the early days of the republic I.angdon
, Cneves said. "The Presidency of the
T'nited States is an office which no citizen
has a right to seek or to refuse." Admiral
Dewey is about to undertake a tour of the
country. AYe may be sure he Is not mak
ing it solely for the sake of receiving ova
tions and getting his hand shaken. It
looks as If the hero had his ear to the

When lynching has ceased In the United
States and the history of it is to be wrtt
j ten, here is an item from a paper In Ar
< kansas that will merit a record:
"The lynchers had forgotten to bring a
rope with them, but the victim had 40
cents in his pocket, and that was just
; enough to purchase a good, strong rope,
which was soon produced from a store
near by. The money, however, was con
sidered us a loan, and was returned to
I the victim's family after the ceremonies
were over."

An invention likely to prove of value to
the musical world is reported from Berlin,
where it la said a certain Dr. Moser has
. devised a sounding-board for the piano
which will improve with age like the body
of a violin and be better after a hundred
i years than when first put together.
The story as it comes from one who
. was present at a test of the "resonance
1 piano," as the inventor calls it. Is interest-
Ing. In the course of his narrative he
says:
" 'What is the first thing a master
1 teaches you to-day?' asked the genial
' doctor. 'It 1s touch. Without touch you
might as well play the xylophone. The
! first time that you put a finger on my
piano you will recognize that it is not the
touch but the instrument that does the
work. You can put your foot on the key
board, and beautifully round, full tone
will ensue. Listen!' The doctor struck
! the middle C smartly with his whole
hand, held like a hatchet, and it may be
I confessed at once that ail present were
surprised, to use no stronger expression,
I at the strength and beauty of the tone.
I The doctor folded his arms and looked on
i triumphantly, while its tones reverberat
i ed through the room as if they would
! never stop, and all the time the overtones
| were clearly and easily distinguished from
the ground tone. A layman might de
scribe it by savins that he had never
heard such a full, round, sweet tone hold
out such a very long time. The doctor
struck the common chord of C major, ana
the effect was certainly marvelous. He
modulated into the minor and then struck
in the bass a palpable discord: but lo ana
bÂ»hold: it sounded actually pleasant. It
was, in a word, orchestral, musical. The
dissonances were like those of the orches
tra in a Wagner score; they seemed to
nave their place, their raison d'etre.'
All of which is very fine and belongs to
the category of things "important if
true." Of the construction of the instru
ment it is said: "The sounding-board of
the modern piano is never thicker than
three-eighths of an inch. Dr. Moser's is
about two inches in diameter. Boards
composed of several pans, joined together
In one way or another, are nothing new in
the history of pianoforte manufacture,
but have always been abandoned. Moser,
however, heLl fast to the idea, and finally
hit upon the right way of combining the
several parts. His first piano was made
in the year 189 S. Now any piano can be
! made over and furnished with a Moser
apparatus."

ROYAL FLUSH AND STRAIGHT
FLUSHâ M. D., City. The American
Hoyle gives the following definition of
j "royal flush" and "straight flush" in draw
1 poker: "A royal flush is a straight or se
; quence, all of the same suit, as ace, two,
three, four and five of diamonds."
"Straight flushâ the same as royal flush."
On the subject of straights, sequence or
rotation, the same authority says: "These
are five cards following in regular order
of denomination, as ace, two, three, four
and five, and the cards may be of differ
ent suits; a straight will beat triplets. In
a straight the ace plays both ways, but its
value is different. When with the king
i queen, knave and ten it makes the highest
1 straight; when with the two, three, four
and rive, the lowest. In some coteries a
royal or straight flush outranks four cards
of the same denomination, but this, like,
j all other modifications not strictly legal,
i must be agreed upon before commencing
the game. It is strongly urged by some
players that the strongest hand at draw
poker should be a straight or royal flush,
i for the reason that it is more difficult to
i get than four of a kind, and removes from
! the game the objectionable feature of an
! invincible hand. It is impossible to tie
four aces or four kings and an ace, but It
is possible for four straight flushes of the
same value to be out in the same deal.
No K-pntleman would care to bet on a sure
i thing, and we therefore think that the
j straight flush should be adopted when
gentlemen play at the game."
A. Howard Gady, in a book on poker re-
I cently published, says: "The straight or
; royal flush is the highest of all hands. It
must consist of a sequence of five cards,
I all of the same suit. The value, of course'
I is determined after the same manner the
straight is, the higher or highest cards
winning."
Robert C. Schenck, in his world-re
nowned book on poker, says that the high
est hand in that game is "a sequence
flushâ which is a sequence of five cards
; and all of the same suit."

SOLDIER SHOOTS
A COMRADE AT
ANGEL ISLAND
Result of an Old Ken-
tucky Feud.
TWO BULLETS TAKE EFFECT
Quarantine of Thirty-First Infantry
Will Be Raised To-Morrow, but
the Regiment Will Remain
in Its Present Camp.
Two soldiers of the Thirty-first Volun
teer Infantry became involved in a shoot
ing affair in the camp at Angel Island
yesterday morning, in consequence of
which one is lying in the regimental hos
pital badly wounded, while the other is in
i the guardhouse. The belligerent privates
; are said to belong to the notorious Hat
, field and McCoy families of Kentucky, be
tween which a bloody feud has raged for
the last twenty years.
When the regiment arrived in San Fran
cisco the fact that members of these fac
tions were serving In the same regiment
was published, but at the same time the
I statement was made that they had agreed
i to bury their differences while wearing
I Uncle Sam's uniform and to satisfy their
desire for fighting by chastising the Fili
plnos. If appears, however, , that the
quiet of Angel Island, where the regiment
has been quarantined almost ever since
its arrival on the coast, was too trying
to the nerves of the fiery Ken tuck fans,
and yesterday they quarreled. They were
separated, but a little later one, a mem
ber of Company K. observed his enemy
examining his gun. He at once jumped to \
the conclusion that, it was either shoot or
get shot, and ho rushed to his tont for his j
I Krag-Jorgensen. Having secured his !
weapon, he returned and at once opened I
fire.
At the first shot the bullet passed
through the arm of the soldier with whom ,
the Company X man had quarreled. As I
the victim turned, us though to return the i
ilre, another bullet from the Krag-Jorg- '
enson struck him in the leg and brought
him to earth. This ended the light. The. !
wounded man, who is a member of Com
pany I, was removed to the hospital, I
where an examination showed that his i
: wounds are serious but not necessarily
fatal. His assailant was promptly placed
under arrest, and will probably spend a
few years at Alcatraz, even though his'
victim should recover.
The quarantine of the Thirty-first Regl
ment will be raised on Monday, but the '
! regiment will probably be detained at
i Angel Island until ordered aboard the I
i transport for Manila ten days hence.
! About ten privates who are still suffering !
i from a mild form of smallpox will, of I
course, be kept Isolated from their com
rades until they have entirely recovered.
The volunteer camps at the Presidio j
have a decidedly desolate appearance just
now. With the exception of the Montana I
Regiment, which occupies a camp on the
hillside Just south of the railroad track
the Twenty-eighth Regiment of Volun
teers, which is encamped on the other i

Sensational Performances at
Academic Athletic League
Championship Meeting.
The athletes of >.:.Â« Oakland High School
again asserted their supremacy on field
and rath yesterday on Berkeley Oval by
scoring the greatest number of points in
the eleventh semi-annual field day of tho
Academic Athletic League. Representa
tives of the school won the quarter-mile
and mile runs, the high jirmp and the re
lay race. Throughout the afternoon the
athletes from Uklah held first place. They
had no men for the relay race, however,
and were compelled to stand idly by at
the last moment and see the championship
which they won at the spring meeting
â wrests from them.
The contests were all spirited ones, be- |
ing bitterly contested from start to finish. ;
Two new stars were developed In Stephen '
Asblll, Lowell High School, and Robert i
Thomas, Uklah High School. The former !
â won the classic "hundred" and the 220
-yard sprints, while Thomas had no com
petitor capable of making him extend j
himself In the 120 and 220 hurdles. He j
ran the shorter distance in 16 1-5 sec- ;
onds, as against the former record of
17 1-6. He â¢ ran the 220 In 27 3-5, taking
a fifth of a second off the record. Had |
he been pressed in competition he would
have reduced the time in both races ma
terially. ;V
Asbill gives promise of developing Into
a great sprinter. He has immense i
etrength and a big, open stride by which
he covers a lot of ground. His home is
in I^ake County, but he is attending
Lowell High School in this city. Up to a
week ago lie was training with the foot
ball team of the school. He then dropped
this heavy work and was given a hasty
preparation for the spjint racing.
Tlie fourth academic record of the day
fell to Irwln; Berkeley High School. He
clean 10 feet, tf?* inches in the pole vault,
the former record being 10 feet 3% inches.
This is not a full measure of Ms ability,
as he has done much better in practice.
Both the distance runs provided desper
ate struggles in the last lap. In the half j
mile Heaiey of Petaluma went out as i
though to make a runaway win of it. He
led by ten lengths the â :: st lap, maintain,
ing this advantage until the beginning
of the last lap. Graves began to cut down
his lead gradually and they rounded into
the finishing straight together. They ran
Etrlde for stride toward the tape, but the
terrific pace told on Heaiey near the end.
He faltered ten yards from homo and
fairly staggered over the finishing line. I
Graves winning a clever race. The mile
was almost a repetition of this except
that four men were struggling to catch
the judges' eyes.
The spectators, the majority of whom
were students, in the various schools,
knr\v the re-lay race was the decisive
ev^nt on the programme. Upon its out
come depended the first three positions
in the table of points. The representa
tives of the Oakland High School took
the lead from the start and try as they
would their opponents could not gel near
them. The Berkeley foothills resounded
with the mad cheering of the students
from the start of the race to its finish.
After It was over the blue colors of Oak
land High School were; cast to th.j breeze
while the athletes who carried them to
victory' were carried off the field In tri
umph.
The day was a trifle warm for severe
competition, but the athletes were able j
to sit about in their abbreviated oosl Limes
without Inconvenience. The attendance
was chiefly made up of young people who
ntti-nd the high schools. John Elliott
made an efficient referee, running off the
track events in good time. Herbert
Hauser, chairman of the committee in
charge of the field day, was congratulated i
on all sid^s on its success. The score of
points before and after the relay race Is

HIGH SCHOOL BOYS PERFORM WELL AS SPRINTERS AND HURDLERS.
THE eleventh semi-annual championship field day of the Academic Athletic L*agrue was held
yesterday on the grounds of the University of California. Two new athletic wonders were
developed in Stephen Asbill of L,owell High School and Robert Thomas of Uklah. The
former won the hundred yard dash and the 220, while the latter proved the greatest
hurdler that ever performed at an Academic League championship meeting. He ran both

May W Fast as a Ghost.
Southern Girl's Debut.
Xot unlike stars of the thpatrical -world,
the first appearance on the local turf this
id of May W, as well as the Call
fornia debut of the fast filly Southern
Girl, was the occasion for a large out
pouring uf racegoers to Oakland yester
day. Both of the equine performers men
tioned wore returned winners, but the
talent suffered some severe reverses dur
, ins the afternoon. Monrovia, Humidity,
â  ante, Horton and Alaria, all pro
nounced choices in the ring, were rocked |
in the cradle of defeat. Money there was ;
in abundance In the ring, and the layers j
of odda enjoyed a prosperous day of it.
The win of the Calgary wonder, M y
W, was the most sensational of the card, j
Whenever she starts an air of deep mys
tery seems to permeate the air, arid
day's race was no exception. May
started In the fourth event, over a mile,
for which Rosinante was a piping hot
choice. Many Inquiries were made as to
the Calgary mare's condition, and reports
were conflicting. On the level, though, it
Id she stepped a mile at Oakland
some weeks ago in 1:40 flat- That she was
fit and ready her race demonstrated..
Heavily played at 9 to 5, T. Walsh, who
had the leg up, sailed away in the lead,
and. catching a land breeze at the stretch
turn, blew in by herself, a length bo-
Core Morinel, in 1:40%. The favorite grew
dizzy trying to catch the flying leader,
finishing an ordinary third. Keolia.
i somewhat out of her class, ran a good

Southern Girl, one of the stars of tho
Burns & Waterhouse stable, made her
j initial bow in the second chapter, a five
furlong sprint for two-year-olds. Bogus
j Bill looked the most likely of those op
posed to her, and the ring held the filly
!a 1 to 4 chance. Getting away from tho
post lirst, the odds-on choice early placed
daylight between herself and the field,
winning eased up. Bogus Bill was ridden
1 out to down The Scot for second place.
The first severe rebuff the crowd re
ceived was when, in the opening mile-and
' a-sixteenth selling affair. Snips, a well
â  turned Fellowcharm mare, turned down
Monrovia, the extensively backed 4 to 5
: favorite. Meadowiark, with the first
choice in close waiting, cut out the pace
i to the stretch, with Snips In fourth posl
j tion under wraps. Headed for the wire
I Buchanan on the last named entry gave
! the mare her head and she won cleverly
by a length. The favorite was second,
about the same distance in front of Mead
owiark.
At the close price of 1 to 8 Humidity
let the short-end players down with a
''- thud In the third event, a seven-furiong
jaunt. The filly acted sour and muleish
at the post, and after leading into the
stretch went all to pieces, finishing In
; the show. Anchored, a 10 to 1 shot, per
] fectly ridden by Postel, disposed of
| Faversham by a neck. The latter should
'â  have won.
Bookmaker John Humphrey's filly, Mid
' lty. scored a pronounced hit in the six
' furlong handicap. Her price was forced
1 down from threes to 7 to 5, but toward
| post time, as the coin went in on Horton,
the favorite, her odds went to 2. She'was
in front almost from the jump and won |
with considerable to spare in 1:14 flat.
Frawley on Horton managed to get cut
off a couple of times and was probably
fortunate to lead Loving Cup out for the
place. At the first false breakaway Bam
boulia, coupled In the betting with Olin
thus, ran away with little Johnson, which
trick he later repeated and was eventually
left at the post.
The closest finish of the day occurred

and the brace of sprinters named fought
it out. Fauntleroy, astride the favorite,
Alaria, managed to get himself beauti
fully cut off and pocketed as the far turn
waa neared, ceasing to be a factor there
after.

WARRING
FACTIONS
AT PEACE
Oakland, Ingleside and West
ern Turf Associations
Arrange Dates.
The war clouds have disappeared from
the local racing horizon. The "peace
committee" from the American Turf Con
gress, comprised of Captain J. H. Recs
and "W. IT- Shulte, yesterday brought
about an amicable understanding be
tween the California Jockey Club, the
Pacific Coast Jockey Club and the new
Western Turf Association, whose plant
at South San Francisco i 3 now in course
of construction.
The knotty problem, which nearly pre
cipitated a war, was the refusal of the
California Jockey Club to exchange an
equal division of dates with the Western
Turf Association and the Ingleside Asso
ciation as well, it being claimed that the
controlling powers in each were Identi
cal In order to fortify itself for the im
pending conflict the California Jockey
Hub threw open to the public the gates
c*f its Oakland track on September 23, an
nouncing at the time that racing would
be continued without cessation until
May, 1900. This brought matters to a
risl iS? nd at a meeting of the American
Turf Congress, held in Chicago in Sep
tember, an effort was made to outlaw the
Oakland track. The motion was tabled,
and as a last effort to bring about peace
a committee was appointed to visit Cali
fornia and try and bring about an ad
justment of the points in debate that
would be satisfactory to all parties con
cerned.
After two or three gatherings at which
nothing was accomplished, the confer
ence met yesterday and the threatened
clash has been averted. The California
Jockey Club was represented by Thomas
11. Williams Jr., the Pacific Coast Jockey
Uub and Western Turf Association by
Henry Croclwr. Captain Rees and W. P.
Sehulte were of course the mediators
T nder the terms of a contract drawn up
and signed, the life of which Is for a te rm
of five years, the California Jockey Club
will get 5u per cent of the racing dates
that may in future be agreed upon, and
the Ingleside and Western Turf associa
tions the other 50 per cent. In the in
terim elapsing before the opening of
Tanforan Park, the date for which has
been set November 5, the racing will con
tinue at Oakland track, Mr. Williams re
fusing to close as he considered It would
work a hardship on the horsemen now

BETTER THAN THE KNIFE.
Pyramid Pile Cure Cures Piles Quick-
ly, Painlessly, Without Danger.
People go along for years, suffering with
piles. They try this, and that, and thÂ«
other thing:, from carrying- a buckeye to
getting treatment from a physician. They
obtain temporary relief maybe, but they
are never quite cured. A little strain in
lifting, excessive fatigue, a little consti-
pation, or a little diarrhea, and the piles
come back.
They don't seem to amount to much,
but they banish sleep and appetite No
position Is comfortable. There is intense
local pain and that dreadful, agonizing
feeling of weight in the perineum.
Maybe in the early stages some of the
many salves on sale will afford tempor-
ary relief. If the case is of long standing
there is only one speedy and sure remedy.
It is Pyramid Pile Cure. Even in light
cases it is the safest thing to use. Other
applications may cure and may not. Py-
ramid Cure Is always certain, always re-
liable, always brings comfort at once. It*
prompt use saves months of severe suf-
fering. In extreme cases it will save
surgical operations and their attendant
dangers and comforts. It is better than
a knife. Will cure easier, quicker and
safer. Thousands have used it. Thou-
sands have been cured by it. The cost
is trifling compared with what it does.
The price is one dollar. Most anybody
would gladly pay ten dollars to be rid of
piles.
Druggists sell Pyramid Pile Cure. If
yours hasn't it, he will get it for' you from
the Pyramid Drug Co., Marshall, Mich.,

OLYMPIC WAS
A TIE GAME
Football Match in Which
Neither Scored â Heat
Makes c. : iow Piay.
Olympic 0, Stanford 0.
On hastily constructed stands running
parallel with the side lines .1 slim crowd
b,,-,v the game between in i Olympics and
Stanford yesterday afternoon on the new
gridiron at Sixteenth and Folsom streets.
Neither team scored after battling
irough twenty-minute halves in a heat
â¢..hat was intended by Providence for
fruit;Urylng purposes.
The game was painfully slow to the
Fpi-ctaii'r and torturing to the player,
who purled and sweltered with every
-..;.,,; effort. It was certainly not the
' weather for football and the snappy,
gi:igery, ..:..â¢ ; -a:. .1-'., work that
characterizes the game as a rule was neg
atively represented in the match yester
day between the clubmen and the cardi
iiai-shirted Stanfordites.
L'wlce the Olympics might have scored
and twice did a relentless fate prevent.
A fumbled ball alter a gain of fifty yards
by clean, persistent bucking wa^s chance
number oi.e gone a-beggiiig. Tne second
setback was Stanford's . iaden stiffening
along me line wnen He Olympics had but.
ten yards to cover ior a. touchaowu and
victory.
Very iittle enthusiasm marked the prog
ress oi * tiie game. Chamberlain; with a.
stack of rea shirts, arrived some half
hour before game was called. "King"
Kelly; Princeton's famous back and couch
of tr.e California team for this season,
was on the tide lines, drinking In the
strength and weaknesses of. the two
teams. To point a niuial and adurn a
tale luge Law lor tola w::at he know of
other days, and Howard Taylor delivered
lectures on the automobile. All this was
on the side lines and did not delay the
game. _
The game started when Chet Murphy's
foot switched the ill into Olympic tor
ritory. Yard by yard the clubmen ad
vanced the plgÃKln into the Stanford ter
ritory. First Carter wuuid plunge, through
the opposing line, then Sheehy, â  rka.uf
or Code, and every dash meant a gain.
Down the rield the Olympic team came,
moving within danger distance of Stan
ford's goal, when a fumble made the ball
Stanford property. With a feeling of re
lief Murphy punted far down the Olympic
territory and Carter, in his eagerness to
do something, fumbled, the ball - Ing to
the college men lifteen yards from the
Olympic goal.
Fearful of results. Murphy tested his
own skill as a drop kicker. The try was
unsuccessful, the ball going into the
crowd and rebounding into Murphy's
hands. Another drop kick was attempted,
but it failed, and he ball was brought
out on the twenty-five yard line by Cad
wallader, from which spot it was punted
toward Stanford's goal. Rudolph fumbled
it and Olympia had another chance to
work for a score. To Stanford's twenty
five yard line the clubmen moved with
persistent gains, but three, times did the
college men hold them without a gain on
this spot, and Stanford recovered the ball.
This is where the first half ended.
Second halfâ CaiUvallauer, mighty and
puffing, kicked off. After a try or two
ihat were fruitless, Murphy punted to the
center of the field. The Olympics, taking
heart and attempting to forget about the
weather, began to work a degree or two
faster, and slowly the ball moved toward
the Stanford goal. Twenty-five yards
from that point the-y again lost the pig
skin by the splendid work of the Stanford
defense, and a punt to the center again
saved the Cardinal. From the center to
the five-yard line the Olympic backs,
dashing, plunging and running, brought
their team within five yards of a touch
down, but again Stanford made a gritty
defense and Olympia could not cross tho
line. Murphy punted to the center.
The time was fast being consumed and
the Olympics were thirsting for a touch
down. ' Dinsmore, by a splendid run of
twenty yards around the Stanford right
end. put life into the clubmen, but at the
same time the college boys braced them- j
selves and the Olympics advanced no far- i
ther. Felton Taylor was put in the game, j
but. nothing was done and the pigskin was j
the property of tho red. Regaining pos- !
session of the ball, Murphy punted and
the whistle blew, which ended the game. j

THE LOCALS
AND CAPITALS
PLAY A DRAW
A Highly Interesting; Contest
Closed by Darkness When
the Score Stood 8 to 8.
Umpire O'Connell called the pame be
tween San Francisco and Sacramento, the
leaders in the race for the pennant, at the
end of the tenth inning yesterday on ac
count of darkness and the first game of
their series will have to be fought over
again to-day. When O'Connell declared
the game a draw the score stood 8 to S
and there was every possibility of it con
tinuing for many more innings, as the
players, imbued with the enthusiasm of
th>ir profession and the shouting of the
hundreds of spectators present, were
playing the national game as it should be
played.
It was regretted when the red ball of
fire that stood menacingly over the field
throughout the afternoon sunk in the
West. The game, which was notable for
heavy batting and startling plays, was
one of the best seen on the grounds in
many days. Although there was an abun
dance of errors on the part of the local
men nearly every mistake was excusable,
as the chances of stopping the hard hit
ball were extremely slim. Thrice was ihe
score tied during the ten innings played
and only by the narrowest margin.
Doyle was put Into pitch for Sacramen
to, but after being hammered for two in
nings he gave way to Harvey. The au
burn-haired twlrler had his speed with
him, but the local team had their lamps
trimmed and they connected with his
shoots, for nine good hits. One, a
home run strike by Krug over the center
field fence, scored Brockhoff and gave the
Friscos a slight lead, and the others were
pretty singles well placed. Iburg was also
touched up hard and often, the Capital
City team batting up to its usual high
standard. Clever fielding by Pyne, Muller
and Hildebrand saved the local pitcher
from annihilation. Many of the "flies"
the three players got under had every
Indication of being safe drives.
Umpire O'Conneli earned the enmity of
the crowd by Judging a palpably foul fly
a safe hit, on which two Sacramento men
scored. This so disheartened the locals
that they played loosely until fortune
smiled on them late in the game and they
took on a new lease of life. "Heney r *
Krug shut off a run in the ninth by mak
ing a pretty one-hand stop, touching the
second cushion and doubling a man on
first. Following is the score:

HUNGER STALKS
THROUGH PEST
HOUSE WARDS
No Food Remains for
the Unclean.
Â«. â .
Official neglect is responsible, for 8 con
dition of affairs at the Pesthouse, which
has developed into one of the greatest
public outrages committed In the annals
of the municipal government. All day
Friday, It became known yesterday, the
unclean and dying lepers at this institu-
Uon, which has long been a disgrace, lay
picking at their coverlets, hungry and
miserable. Nine of these unfortunates,
burning away with the most loathsome
a afflicts the human flesh, had
to be content with a meager portion each
of mush of poorest quality, while the
samt lot fell to Mrs. A. G. Gilson, confined
in the institution with smallpox, and four
teen attendants. These people, all of them
unfortunate, the attendants martyrs to
their calling, the smallpox patient pitiful
in her distress, and the lepers, the ac
cuisfed of Hit) earth, are all prisoners be
neath thÂ« yellow flag. Friday, when all
the food had been consumed, an effort to
reach the officials was made that their
plight might be made known. As usual,
the critical period found the telephone
out of order. It was finally repaired yes
ty and Dr. Lawlur of the Board of
Health notified. After being notified,
hi v>. \ er, there was nothing to be done.
The physician's hands were tied, as only
lu.->i week the Board of Supervisors gave
notice that all creditors of the city would
be hold strictly within the reading of the
one-twelfth act. The merchant? who
supplied the City and County Hospital
and the Pesthouse have as yet received
no money for the months of August and
â September, mid naturally they refused to
Bend out necessary supplies. As a last
resort a subscription was taken up among
the attaches of the Board of Health. Each
subscribed to the good cause, several
pieces of gold were raised and a man was
Immediately dispatched to the home of
the- lepers with provisions. He was met
at the gate by one of the attendants, who
gladly accepted the food, which will last
until this morning. Another subscription
must then be taken up unless some chari
tably inclined citizen comes forward,
takes hold of the matter and supplies the
inmates with food.
Another part of the outrage is that the
coal with which to keep the suffering in
mates warm is about exhausted. There
seem? to be no hope for replenishing the
supply in the near future and the outlook
is rather hopeless. Dr. Lawlor of the
Board of Health is disgusted, and rightly
so, at the action of Mayor Phelan and the
Board of Supervisors in neglecting the
public institutions. Receiving hospitals
have been closed, medicines have been
begged and there Is no food for the starv
ing inmates. Dr. Lawlor has done all he
can, he says, on behalf of the suffering
poor, but now the Board of Supervisors
must show that it is not afraid to do
right, although It would be contrary to
usual practice, and see that the wrongs of
the past are unknown in the future.

Presiding: JudÃe Trearlwell of the PoMce
Courts has Issued a circular containing
Shortly after 1 o'clock yesterday Barne
! son went to the bank and drew the
amount which was afterward stolen from
; his buggy. It was intended for his broth
| er, who was anxious to consummate some
; mining deal. The money, which was in $20
gold pieces, was placed in a canvas sack
and deposited under the seat of the buggy.
; Barneson, after leaving the bank, drove
up Market street. When in front of The
' Call building his attention was attracted
to the immense crowds that were reading
the bulletins of the great yacht race. Aiix
i ious to see how the race was troing.
Barneson pulled up his horse and eagerly
i scanned the bulletins.
While he was thus engaged an unknown
thief climbed Into the buggy and got away
with the sack of money. * Barneson dis
covered his loss a few minutes later arid
at once notified the police. Several de
tectives were immediately sent to hunt
< for the culprit, but up to a late hour last
night they had not succeeded in getting a
i trace of him.
Mrs. John Drake, who Is employed in a
i photograph gallery at 3 Brook place, off
Market, between Kearny street and Grant
i avenue, says she saw the thief steal the
I sack of coin. She describes him as being
: about 35 years of age, 5 feet 10 or 11 inches
I in height and having a light mustache.
He did not wear a collar and looked like
ian opium fiend. Immediately after steal
ing the money, she says, he quickly
1 walked up Market street.
The police are inclined to think that the
I bold thief followed Barneson from the
i bank and waited his opportunity to steal
i the sack of coin. It came when Barneson
; stopped to read the bulletins of the yacht
I race.
In many respects the bold thief is sim
ilar to the one by which Wells, Fargo &
Co.'s wagon was robbed of $f>ooo. It Is
claimed by the police that that crime was
committed by Casey and Kelly, members
of the Howard pang of Australian crooks,
but for lack of evidence to convict the sus
pects were not arrested.

A meeting of the Finance Committee of
the School Board last Friday evening de
veloped another scandal in the board, In
volving Directors Conlon and Gedge, and
which may have serious results so far as
city finances are concerned.
In auditing the various bills presented
to the board the committee discovered
that the Supplies Committee, of which
Conlon and Gedge are members, had is
sued requisitions for school furniture
amounting In value to more than $10,000.
The requisitions had been recommended
by Conlon and Gedge, but had never been
authorized by the board.
Conlon was brought before the Finance
Committee and positively denied all
knowledge of thematter. According to one
of the members of the committee, how
ever, this denial was a lie, for an inspec
tor examined the requisitions and discov
ered that Conlon authorized them and
placed them with the firm of C. F. Weber
& Co., who furnished the goods to the
various schools. The inspector was sent
to the different schools of the city and
found that the sunnlies had been deliv
ered and were in use.
A special meeting of the Finance Com
mittee has been caled for Tuesday night
when the matter will be carefully looked
into and a report will be made to the full
board setting forth the facts.
Since the School Board is in difficulties
regarding finances and can scarcely carry
on the schools from month to month the
present exposure of a debt of $10,000 will
bring grave trouble to the school system
of the city, and may have serious results
that will be more far reaching than the
mere expenditure of so large a sum would
Indicate.
FREE BAPTISTS IN SESSION.
Mrs. Frances Pugh Elected Moder-
ator of the State Association.
The State Free Baptist Association met
yesterday with the congregation of the
Bush-street Baptist Church. Mrs. Frances
M. Pugh of Oakland was chosen mod
erator of the State Association. The
Pacilic Coast Union, an auxiliary body,
composed of Free Baptists whether or not
church members, elected the following
trustees: Q. C. Stillman, Petaluma; E. K.
Abbott, Salinas; Clark Hill, Corralltos;
Edwin Bothwell Jr., Oakland; Clark
Blethen, J. H. Norri% and Rev. Neil
Brandt, San Francisco.
Rev. Mr. Brandt, the new pastor of the
Bush-street church, preached the associa
tion sermon in the afternoon. His subject
was "The Christian Race."
The following resolutions were unani
mously adopted:
"Resolved, That we extend our heart
felt sympathy to the First Baptist Church
of this city In view of their great loss and
sincerely hope thnt the catastrophe may
open the hearts of the many friends of
the church to aid them in rebuilding, so
that the glory of the second house shall
exceed that of the former.
"Resolved, That we regard the 'canteen
derision' of Attorney General (Jriprgs nul
lifying a law of Congress as the most out
rageous decision made by either court or
interpreting official since the days of the
Dred Scott decision. We earnestly request
the President of the T'nited States to en
forpe tho law of Congress against thÂ»
army grogshop, according to the evident
intent of the law."
HIS HONOR CONGRATULATED.
When Judge Conlan took his seat on the
bencli yesterday morning he was present
ed with a beautiful bouquet of flowers
from some of the members of tlir> b;ir.
Attorney Mark said that he had pleas
ure in extending his congratulations to
the Judge on his renomination and
thanked him for the uniform kindness
and courtesy shown by him to the mem
bers of 'he bar irrespective of their polit
ical principles. That induced all to Join
in their congratulations.
Ex-Judge Ferral said he Indorsed heart
ily everything that had been said by At
torney Mack and thought the Judge's re
nomination showed that the people, irre
spective of party politics, found him a
tried, true and efficient Judge.

cables are famous, and one of these cables
carried on one of Its cable steamers will
be '"raid out" as the vessel followÂ» the
racing yachts. The cable will connect at the
land end with wires running: directly to the
New York Journal office and thence by spe
cial leased wire to the Examiner office in
Son Francisco. In this manner there will
be uninterrupted communication between
the cable steamer and the Examiner. Those
â who watch the bulletins will have the news
within a few seconds after It Is noted by
the correspondents who are watching the
race. There will be no need of waiting:
for from ten to twenty minutes after the
race 1* over or after It has been declared
oft to learn the facts. Just as on Thurs
day, the reading public will be informed of
what has happened without delay.
Plainly the Examiner bad boy Is a per
sistent brat. Undeniably his conscience
cannot be quickened by punitive appli
cations to his mendacious understanding.
Strap oil Is wasted upon him, shingles
sting him in vain. Only onÂ« remedy ap
pears to be left. Make him swallow his
own lies, and, on the principle that like
cures like, or kills It, the Examiner yellow
kid may yet become a truthful boy or an
excellent fertilizer for the daisies.
The last lie of the Examiner bad boy did
not fool many people. Some few â very
few at that, made up of those who could
not get close enough to The Call board to
read the Marconi bulletins of the great

SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 8, 1899.
Call photographers went out yesterday
morniriK during the progress of the great
race between the Columbia and the Sham
rock. They had been directed to take
photographs at 10:30 o'clock and at 11:30
o'clock of the crowds In front of the office
of this paper and of the Examiner. They
did .-is Instructed. The photographs they
took are published herewith and speak for
themselves. They show undeniably where
the crowds were, and it goes without say-
Ing that, where crowds congregate, there
something is happening.
Look at the photographs. Count the
onlookers at the bulletins of the shame
less yellow kid, still smarting from con
tinued applications of the slipper. Try
it on the photographs of The Call crowds.
What? You give it up? You would think
the shameless examiner brat would do
the same, wouldn't you? Well; the
chances are that he will do nothing of the
kind. The little beggar must be wrong in i
the head. That would explain it. Noth
ing else can make clear any claims he :
may make to excellence for the miserable
showing he made on the third attempt to
sail he great yacht race.
Thousands and thousands of people in
this city had another opportunity yester
day to compare the bulletin service faked
and furnished by the yellow kid and that
sent out by Marconi on the wireless tele
graph to The Caii. As on the two ouier
occasions .when attempts have been made
to sail the yachi. race the great Italian
did all and more than he promised. â  From
start to finish every movement of the
racers was follow"., in a running story,
lucid, Interesting and truthful. There was
no padding. Every word was intended to
count. There was no "perhaps" about it,
no "It seems" and "it appears," or "It
looks like," as the Examiner yellow kid
was forced to use in a fatuous effort to
deceive.
The Examiner bad boy, it will bo noted,
said in his matutinal lie: "Watch the
Examiner bulletins on the yacht race!
They will give the news most accurately,
most fully ami most rapidly." A few sam
ples taken at random, almost before those
who had been lured on the rocks of dis
appointment by the "dulcet" shrieks of
the Examiner's siren had time to recover,
will show how the bad boy fulfilled the
"most rapidly" part of his promise.
At 11:20 a. m.. New Fork time, the yel
low kid posted a bulletin that the starting
gun had been ftred and the yachts were
off. At 11:35 he posted anoth.r that the
wind had shifted and decreased to about
nine miles an hour. Ten minutes later,
apparently to show that the Shamrock
wasn't using her sails, he posted this:
"11:45 a. m.â Shamrock lowers her spin
naker and hoists it again after shaking it
out."
Andâ now note the "most rapidly"â at
11:55 a. m.. New York time, it posted the
following:
"Columbia's spinnaker flaps, somewhat
In the lightening breeze. The smoke of
excursion craft goes straight up out by
the yachts, which are now about five
miles from the starting point."
"Rapidly!" "Most rapidly!" You Just
wager it is. Poor Marccni, a stranger in
a strange land, could not keep up with
that sort of pace. Figure it out for your
self: Yachts started by the Yellow Kid
PHOTOGRAPHS SHOW WHICH WAY THE CROWDS GO.
Above are two photographs taken yesterday morning in front of The Call business office during the progress of the
great yacht race. The upper one was taken at 11:30 o'clock from the entrance of the building. The lower one was
taken at noon and shows the crowd directly in front of The Call's Marconi bulletins. Another photograph, reproduced
on tills page, will allow the reader to count the number of people In front of the Examiner's "perhaps" bulletins.
at 11:20 a, m., breeze nine knots an hour;
11:35 Shamrock takes in spinnaker, dusts
it and hoists it again; 11:55 a. tn.,
yachts about five miles from the start
ing point. Five miles in thirty-five min
utes in a nine-knot breeze, is a mile every
seven minutes. At tnat rate of "most
rapid" bulletins the entire course of fif
teen miles could be Kalleil In the same
breeze in 3 hours and 30 minutes.
â .Most rapidly!" Well, rather. Too
rapid for the managers of the race, who
allow the boats live hours and thirty
minutes to finish. Ton rapid, it seems, for
Columbia and Shamrock on two former
occasions to complete the course. Un
doubtedly rapid. The Yellow Kid must
have been traveling with the Prince of
Wales' set.
In another section of the matutinal lie
the Yellow Ki<l said he was trusting to no
( xporitnent, and furl her on, although he
refrained from referring to Marconi as
"Macaroni," ho sitick his tongue in his
sallow cheek ah<i Intimated unkind things
about the distinguished Italian whose
coming i i this country has resulted in the
yellow Infant's sore lambasting. H
he was i n Ihe Mackay-Benneti boat, get

of the race. The <'all had the same thing,
i; also ha I the Associated Press bulletins,
and II had the Marconi service, which the
Yellow Kid pretends to look upon as an
experiment. The <"ai! received and still
has the Mackay-Bennett cable bulletins;
it also got and har the Associated Press
bulletins. It used neither for the very
good reason thai it had the real and only
things â the bulletins seni by Marconi's
own hand. The Examiner bad boy wan
I forced to use the others -when he did not
i fake, a brit t comparison of the two will
j not be amiss.
Af;.-r b few preliminary bulletins an
nouncing the maneuverings of the yachts
and the Intelligence thai the wind was,
blowing, with gi.od promise of a race, The i
<'ull at 8:15 a. m., San Francisco time,
posted a bulletin announcing that the pre- :
paratory signal gun had been tired. The
Yellow Kid posted similar Intelligence nine
minutes later. At 8:20 a. m. The Call
announced the start, and at 8:25 a. m. the !
Examiner's bad boy Mew his tin whistle
to Indicate thai the race was on. At the
same time The Call posted a bulletin that j
the Columbia had crossed the line, and
four minuti s later tho Yellow Kid repeated
the news. Then again, at 8:38 o'clock, San
FranclfcCO time, he posted this, to make
sure, possibly, that his first bulletin had j
not been misunderstood: "They are offâ
Journal." He might as well have included
himself with the Journal to make the
plural of those off.
At 9:56 a. m., Saji Francisco time, as
another instance of the Examiner bad
boy's "most rapidly," he put the Sham
rock 200 yards ahead on the bulletin
board. Two minutes later he put out a I
bulletin that the yachts were on even |
terms, raring neck and neck. Pretty rap
idly itself, but nothing to the next one.
At 10:55, San Francisco time, the Yellow
j<i(i posted:
ASBURY PARKâ Columbia now
appears to be gaining on Shamrock.
The boats from here appear to ba
about a quarter of a mile apart.
Three miles from stakeboat.
Three minutes later the Examiner Yel
low Kid, baring Mown on the sails,
caused both yachts to turn the stakeboat,
Columbia leading, a minute ahead of the
Shamrock. Accornlnp to the yellow Ex
aminer's own bulletins, just quoted, the
Columbia had in three minutes not only
overcome the Shamrock's lead of one
quarter of a mile, but both yachts had
sailed three miles in three minutes.
A mile a minute. That beats Southern
Pacific time all hollow. "Most rapidly."
thanks to the Yellow Kid. Undoubtedly
he must have been traveling with the
Prince.
For all the "most rapidly" of the Yel
low Kid, he could not manage to make It

at critical times. Mr. Marconi, strangor
as he is in a strange land, sent a bulletin
at 1:40 p. m., New York time, posted here
at 10:41 a. m. by The Call, to the following
effect: 1:40 p. m. â Shamrock turns. Co
lumbia turns a few seconds later." On
The Call's mimic ocean, in accordance
with Marconi's bulletin. Shamrock was
ahead of Columbia, In a bulletin some
fifteen or twenty minutes later the Ex
aminer corrected its chart and put the
Shamrock where Marconi said she was.
Quite a concession from the perverse yel
low Examiner kid.
At 11:16 a. m., San Francisco time, he
was at it again, posting a bulletin. "Co
lumbia appears to have regained ilm
lead." The Call, a minute before posted:
"Columbia goes on port tack. Has not
succeeded in reducing Shamrock's lead."
At 11:17 the Examiner boy put m;t this
one: "1:52 p. m., Columbia has lead and
is outpointing Shamrock"; and at 11:19
a. m. this <m>/: "2 p. m.. Shamrock gains
a trifle in tacking-, but is still behind."
How do these bulletins compare with
this one from Marconi, posted by The
Call at 11:22 a. m., San Francisco tlmo:
Columbia has not been in the lead
since the yachts turned the stake
boat.
It's Marconi and the Examiner bad boy
for it. Which will you believe?
The bad boy. a few minutes later, evi
dently believed Marconi, for at 11:30, San
Francisco time, he put the Shamrock
ahead on the cornice, in utter disregard
for another of his bull. -tins that read:
"Now York, I'io.'i p. m., Columbia out
pointing Shamrock and sailing like a
witch in the light breezes "
But what's the use of sroing- further?
What's tlip use of catching the yellow
kid in lies out of his own mouth? What's
the use of showing the slips he made, like
this ridiculous one, for instance:
"N. V., 12:28 a. m.- Mr-. Iselin comes on
deck cf Columbia. Wind is ten miles an
hour at the Hook."
If the Mackay-Bennett was near enough
to the race to see Mrs. [selin come on
the Columbia's deck how in thunder could
even a pig see the wind blowing ten miles
an hour at Sandy Hook?
It would tire a horse u> show the ridioti
lousness of the yellow kid's preti â :
and the hollowness of his perform..:
but a brief glance at the conclusion will
do no harm:
At 1:31 p. m.. San Francisco time, The
Call posted the announcement, "Race
off."
At 1:34 p. m. the Chronicle followed
suit.
At 1:43 p. m. the Examiner bad boy did
likewise and two minutes later he blew
his tin whistle to emphasize the fact that
the racb was off.
Shame! shame! little yellow boy! to let
your granny on the Chronicle beat you
out that way. Shame!
The superiority of The Call's service
was so marked that comparison is hardly
necessary to convince the people of San
Francisco that wireless telegraphy is an
adjunct to modern journalism that places
it far and away ahead of the old method.
What Sanarelli did for humanity Marconi,
his distinguished countryman, has done
for the progressive newspaperâ made it
immune to the ravages of the yellow mi
crobe. In San Prancisco the people have
seen it tried, and any number of them
stand ready to testify with The Call that
wireless telegraphy is no experiment.

ANOTHER HEROIC ACT
BY ENGINEER WILLS
DISTRICT ENGINEER JOHN

heroism yesterday, an act none
the less heroic because the sub
ject was a Chinese woman, who died
after having been taken out of a
burning building by the brave fireman
at the risk of his own life in trying
to save her?.
The fire broke out at 8:45 o'clock in
the morning in the second story of a
ac lodging-house at X' : v Bartlett
alley. Between twelve and f< â¢
Chinese lodgers were asleep a 1 the
time, and they would have been suf
focated by the smoke had it not been

employed by Ah Chut, the lodging

mates, and these abandoned the
woman to her fate and escaped

After all the bids had been read the

blouses and trousers, and they were re

The representative of the Pettibone
Company objected to the bids being
changed after they had been opened. The
board ruled that it had a right to order
such a change. The representative said it
was not fair to allow bidders to make al

A YEAR OF GOOD WORK.
Annual Meeting of the Local
Red Cross.
The San Francisco Red Cross Society
held Its annual meeting yesterday after
noon at the rooms of the Philomath Club,
Van Ness avenue. Reports of the years
work were made by the offlrers and a
new board was elected. President Mrs.
John F. Merrill stated in her opening re
marks that few of the members thought
: at the last annual session that when the
! next year rolled around it would find the
country ptlll involved in war.
"Unfortunately for us and our institu
tion this mest harassing, perplexing and
irritating cenflict is still upon us with no
prospect of speedy peace. Through all
this trying year we of the Red Cross have
felt with ever deeper convictions that so
i long as our soldiers are passing back and
I forth through our Golden Gate that we
too, cannot lay down our arms, for there
must always be something that we can do
for those who are doing so much for us
I across the seas."
She said that the work of the ladies
I which was formerly endured by the army
I officials, was now invited, and as a fur
' ther proof of the high esteem In which
tho society is now held it was announced
! that Mrs. Merrill had had conferred upon
, her the honor of being elected a corre
j epondlng member of the National Asso
: elation of Military Surgeons.

SERIOUSLY HURT
Accident to Eleven-
Year-Old Boy.

HIS RIGHT FOOT CRUSHED
â¦
FRANK SMITH MAIMED BY A
FREIGHT TRAIN.
â : â Â» .
Through Rare Presence of Mind the
Boy Managed to Escape Being
Mangled Into a Shape
less Mass.
Frank Smith, aged 11 years, narrowly
escaped being killed by a freight train at
Twentieth and Illinois streets late yester- \
flay afternoon. As it was, he had his
right foot crushed to such an extent that
amputation may be necessary.
Shortly after 5 o'clock the unfortunate
boy was returning to his home at 908 ll
linoia street, and as his progress was
blocked by a freight train he started to j
cross between two of the cars. Just as
he placed his hands on the iron coupling
that held the cars preparatory to jumping
over it the train started. The hapleas j
boy was knocked down, the wheel crush- '
ing his right foot.
How he escaped being Instantly killed
seems miraculous. After the train had :
gone on for a short distance one of the j
members of the crew saw the boy lying
on the road and he at once signaled the
engineer to stop. With the assistance of
a bystander the unfortunate child was
carried to his home, where a doctor was
summoned. Subsequently young Smith
was sent to the City and County Hos
pital and treated by Dr. Onesti.
The boy claims that after he had started
to cross between the cars the man in
charge* gave the signal to the engineer to
proceed:
"Seeing my danger," he said, when giv
ing his version of the accident, "I en
deavored to jump over the coupling that
held the cars, when I was knocked down
I had the presence of mind to quickly re
gain my feet and tried to get out of the
way or the cars. The next instant the
front wheel of the last car struck my foot
and passed over It. Stunned from the
I shock, I threw myself off the track, which
act saved my life."

DECISION OF THE
SUPREME COURT
ON THE CHARTER
Report of a Peculiar
Compromise.
COUNTY OFFICERS ARE SAFE
THEY MAY SERVE OUT THEIR
FULL TERMS.
San Francisco May BÂ« Compelled to
Jfodst Under a Confusing Com
posite Government for
Three Years.
Rumors were rife yesterday that the
Supreme Court had rendered its decision
I in reference to the legality and constitu
; tionality of the charter, and that the
opinion of the court would be handed '
down when the tribunal assembled at I
Los Angeles. The members of the court
1Â« ft yesterday afternoon for the southern
I city and no absolute confirmation of the
i reports could be obtained. Those that
1 are perhaps in a position to know declare,
however, that the decision has been writ
ten and is essentially a compromise opin
ion sustaining the constitutionality of the
i charter and establishing the legality of
I Its adoption, but granting to the county
S officers the full term for which they were
elected.
This means that purely county officers,
such as the Sheriff, Coroner, County Clerk,
I Recorder, District Attorney and Public
! Administrator, will hold office for four
years from last January. Not long sinco
the Supreme Court decided that the coun
ty officers under the provisions of the
county government act held office for
four years. It is presumed that this act
I is superior to the charter, which would
possess a retroactive power if it nullified
the law under which the counties of the
State are governed.
If the opinion of the Supreme Court be
as it has been represented the officials
that have a purely municipal power must
be elected at the approaching election, it
being assumed that the people of the city
have the right to dictate their own affairs,
where that dictation is not in conflict
with the organic law of the State. San
Francisco would tuen have a composite
government for at least three years, when
the terms of the present county oflicr-rs
would expire and their successors would
be elected under the provisions of the
charter. This would necessarily involve
some confusion, which would have to be
endured until the charter became fully
operative.

SPICY COMPLAINT FILED
â¦
TELLS A STORY OF VIOLATION
OF MARITAL VOWS.
, â¢
Alleges That for Some Time Past He
Has Been Lavishing His At
tentions on Miss May . ,
Scribner.
Josephine S. Curtaz yesterday filed a
spicy suit for divorce against her hus
band, Benjamin A. Curtaz, vice president
of the firm of Benjamin Curtaz & Son,
piano dealers, 18 O'Farrell street. Adul
tery is the ground upon which Mrs. Cur
taz seeks for a decree of court granting
her an absolute divorce, Miss May Scrib
ner being named as corespondent.
The complaint, if borne out by facts, re
veals a condition which indicates that the
defendant in the suit is lost to all honor
and decency, for it is charged that he not
only violated his marital vows, but did it
in such open and notorious manner as t'i
bring public humiliation and disgrace to
the woman he swore to honor and protect.
By way of introduction to her complaint
Mrs. Curtaz seta forth that she married
her hnsband in Oakland on July 5, 1893.
After a short residence in the city across
the bay they moved to this city and be
gan housekeeping at 1307 Waller street.
They have two children, Benjamin F., 5
years of age, and Albert H., who was
born in March, 159f<. In March, 1597, Mrs.
Curtaz alleges, her husband engaged in
scandal with Miss Scribner in Napa. Sub,
sequently, in this city, he kept her at tfr-' ;
Recamier, 632 Post street, she avers, aid
then, to place a fitting climax on the scan
dal, took the woman to his home during
the absence of Mrs. Curtaz. Miss Scrib
ner acted in such a bold, notorious man
ner, Mrs. Curtaz continues, that she was
the common talk of the neighbors, which
was a cause of great mental worry to the
plaintiff.
In addition to the household furniture,
which she values at $2000, Mrs. Curtaz
says her husband has in his possession,
stock in the corporation of which he i.-j
vice president which is worth $75,000. Sho
asks for the furniture and an equal divi
sion of all other of her husband's assets
and the custody of hoth her children, as
j she avers that her husband is not. a lit
; and proper person to retain their custody.

her arm was so pore that she could not
raise it. On the 4th instant, ac
cording to Mrs. Tray's allegations, a
quarrel occurred over me trivial affair,
and on this occasion the husband caught
".he wife by the hair and pulled and

TWO MEMBERS
ARE EXPELLED
FOR HERESY
Methodists Drop Two
Pastors.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, j
90S Broadway, Oct. 7.
The question as to whether ministers of !
the Methodist Episcopal Church South !
should circulate literature written by the
divine healer Dowie came before the corN
ference this morning. Rev. Mr. Taylor of
Willows and Rev. Mr. Reeve of Orland
were callad to account for having circu
lated such literature.
The tracts complied by Dowie contain
S'inie very satirical references to the po
sition of the Methodist church regarding !
divine healing, and Bishop Duncan asked
the two clergymen whether, after taking
the vows of the church, they thought it
r ghl to circulate literature In which the j
Bgq of the church were reviled. The j
p suggested that if the two pastors j
felt called upon :<â¢ follow the teachings
of Dowse, they should sever their connec
tion with the church and ally themselves
with the exponents of Dowie's doctrines.
Presiding Elder Emery, who brought up |
the matter, said he had done everything
In hl^ power to show the two pastors their \
error, and failing in that had requested j
them to withdraw from the church, but i
his overture was not favorably received.
After a discussion the Bishop appointed j
a committee of investigation, consisting of
Kcvs. A. Odom, R. K. Alien and W. E.
Vaughan. The committee presented a re- |
port to the Bishop asking that a trial
committee be appointed.
Rev. J. J. M. Kenney -was appointed
prosecutor, and the Bishop announced the
following trial committee: W. J. Mahan >
(chairman i. \Y. A. Booker. 1. F. BettS,
J. A. Batehelor, D. Bauer, F. M. Staton,
W. B. Phillip*, C. E. Clark, Z. J. Need
ham and H. W. Curran.
Thf> trial committee at once went into
secret session, no time fur delay being
permissible, as this is the last day of the
conference.
The committee appointed to Investigate
the charge uf heresy has, under the policy
of tlv Methodist Church South, extra
ordinary power?, and its decision is final.
The trial was narked more by sympathy j
than by other features, every member "f
the committed being more than anxious to
bring about a char.ge of heart in the two
pastors at the bar.
When the charges and specifications
were read both pastors pleaded guilty. !
Rev. T. H. B. Anderson of Missouri, who
was present, pleaded hard with the two
ministers to Ignore the teaching of Faith j
Healer Dowie, who has recently become
involved in a serious scandal in Chicago,
but without result.
The trial was very brief, as there was
nothing to d?> but h'-t on the pleas of the
arraigned. The report presented to the ;
conference stated that the committee had
Investigated the conduct of Revs. Mesnrs.
Reeve and Taylor and had found them !
both guilty of all the charges and speci
fications, which consisted of allegations
tliat the two pastors had. en their own
confession, sown dissension In the church,
contrary to the tenets of their religion.
The committee expelled both pastors >
from the conference. One reference of
Dowie'a to Methodists was held to be par- !
irly offensive.. It reads as follows:
"There was one thing' made me laugh at !
the whole Methodist position. I can un- ;
derstand a man some time in uncertainty
Bitting astride a fence with one leg on
each side. He will come down. But when
I found the Methodist church sitting not
on top of the fence but underneath it and
on both sides of it in regard to the funda- |
mental ordinance of baptism It struck !
me as the most Idiotic performance I
had ever seen.
"They were quite willing to sprinkle
you; that was all right. They wore quite j
willing to pour on you; that was all right.
They would dip you once; thnt was all
right. They would dip you three times.
They would take all these four forms of
baptism. They would do it any way you
likeâ only become a Mah-hah-bone Meth
odist."
The expelled pastors dix-lare that they
are acting in accordance with the dic
tates of their consciences. To-morrow
i.iirht the ISishop will announce the ap
pointments for next year, and the con
ference will elope.
ANOTHER MRS. M'NEVIN

OAKLAND, Oct. 7.â The complications

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, y SUNDAY, OCTOBER 8. 1899.
ALAMEDA COUNTY
PLANK'S DESIRE
MAY BE OBEYED
OAKLAND, Oct. 7.â Some of the
old printers of Oakland are
anxious that the wishes of the
late Ed Plank, an old-time
coast printer, be carried out.
only the question of expense prevent
ing them taking action at once. Plank
died a few di'.ys a#o in Boise City.
Idaho, after a long illness. Every
member of the craft as late as 1892
knew Ed Plank, who was twice presi
dent of the International Typographi
cal Union. When he first came to
California in Nevada's booming day
he worked in Virginia City, and for
two years represented Storey County
in the Nevada Legislature.
"When business left Nevada, Plank
went to Ban Francisco, and was well
known In the printing offices on Clay
street. He was always faithful to the
rules of labor unions, and after his re
tirement as president of the Interna
tional Typographical Union he took
editorial charge of a paper in Idaho.
Things prospered for a while until by
some unlucky chance the county seat
was moved away, from .his town and
business went with it.
Mr. Plank frequently expressed the
wish that his remains might be laid to rest in the printers' plat at Laurel
Hill Cemetery. He had been present at funerals of many members of the
craft and had chosen a spot under a tree at the southwest corner of the
plat as the scene of his last resting place. It is probable that a subscrip
tion will be taken up to have the remains removed to a place that will bÂ«
shaded by Ed Plank's favorite tree.

third annual doll show, which will be held u:ider the auspices of the
Doctor's Daughters In the maple room of the Palace Hotel on Friday
and Saturday, November 17 and 13. These affairs have attracted un
bounded interest In the past, and the one to come will certainly equal,
If not surpassall previous attempts.
The principal milliners and modistes of the city have expressed their in
tention of entering daintily chid model dolls for competition, and a spirited
rivalry is sure to result. The prizes will be (26 for each class of dolls. A spe
cial feature will be the exhibition of ro'f gowns.
The lady patronesses who have already vclunteered their valued assistance
are Mrs. -William G. Irwin. Mrs. John D. Spreckels. Mrs. Joseph Tobin. Mrs.
M. H. de Vcung. Mrs. William Kohl. Mrs. George Crocker, Mrs. Ira Pi.rco,
Mrs. Henry J Crocker, Mrs. Charles Alexander of New York and Mrs. Will
lam H. Crocker. Additional acceptances from other Indies prominent in social

active members, besides innumerable associate members, who administer to
the wants of the poor and sick, buying food, clothing, medicines and other
necessities. They make no distinction of race or creed, expend vast sums of
money In their Rood work and are therefore entitled to the substantial sup
port of the public. It was through the Doctor's Daughters that the city was
presented with the first fully equipped modern ambulance, by Mrs. Herman
Oelrichs and Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt Jr., then Miss Fair.
The present officers are: President, Miss Susie McEwen; vice presidents,
Mrt=. Chauncey R. Wlnslow and Miss Jennie Blair; treasurer, Mrs. Alfred S.
Tubbs; recording secretary. Miss Bruce; corresponding secretary, Mrs. Ed
ward A. Belcher.
HE MAY BE INTERSTATE
COMMERCE COMMISSIONER
ALEXANDER MACKIE, Secretary of the Valley Road.
THE Pacific Coast Is out for an Interstate Commerce Commissioner to fill
the place left vacant by the resignation of Calhoun, and If the merchants
and business men of the coast are successful It Is more than probable
that Alexander Mackle, secretary of the Valley road, will be the fortu
nate man who will secure the coveted position.
When seen yesterday regarding his reported candidacy Mr. Mackle admit
ted that he was after the office, and his backing- gave him bright promises of
success. Further Inquiry among the business men of the city elicited the fact
that Mackle Is their almost unanimous choice. He not only has all the larger
business concerns with him In his fight for the office, but has the backing of
the Merchants' Association, the Chamber of Commerce and the Board of Trade
as well. This influence is enough to easily give him the place unless Califor
nia is left out altogether, and the office goefe not by merit or fitness, but by
political pull to reward some old henchman of the administration who Is out
of a Job.
There was some suspicion that the Southern Pacific had Its eyes on some
one who would be subservient to Its will In all matters that might come up be
fore the commission In which the great railroad corporation would have an
Interest. This report can safely be said to be without real foundation if the
expressions of J. C. Stubbs, third vice president of the road, may be taken
as an Indication of the policy of the oompany.
"There are five Interstate Commissioners," said Mr. Stubbs. "They have
heretofore been divided, so as to give every portion of the country except the
far West a representation. One has come from New England, one from New
York, two from the Middle States, one from the middle West and one from
the South. Now that one of these gentlemen has created a vacancy by re
signing it 1b only right that the Pacific Coast should be given the spare place.
"The commission Is of much more importance to the people of a commu
nity than It is to any railroad, and every section of the Vniterl Suites that Is
distinctive In Its people, its commerce and its products, as California, should
have a representative on the commission who thoroughly understands the
ne^4s of the section of the country from which he Is appointed, and who will
honestly work for the good of the community as a whole.
"This appointment should be based entirely on fitness for the place, and
should not be made a reward for any political services in the past, present or
future."
COOPER MAY
HAVE PERISHED
IN THE FLAMES
Hotel at Lafayette in
Ruins.
OAKLAND, Oct. 7.â Joseph Cooper's
hotel at Lafayette was burned to the
gTOund early this morning, and it is
feared that Cooper and his cook perished
In the flames, as neither can be found.
The fire broke out soon after midnight
and burned continuously till this evening,
| as there were absolutely no appliances
I with which to fight the blaze. The hotel
was a big two-story building and Cooper
and the cook lived in it. There was a
saloon on the ground floor and when it
closed Cooper used to retire upstairs. Oc
casionally he went to Oakland, but no one
saw him go last night, and nothing hns
been heard of him. It is paid to be cer
tain that he would never leave the hotel
unless some one were in it.
To-morrow a search will be commenced
to settle the fate of < "ooper and his cook.
SUDDEN SUMMONS OF
FREDERIC ALLEN POOR
OAKLAND, Oct. 7.â Frederic Allen
Poor, secretary of the State of Maine
Society, died very suddenly at the homo
of his daughter, Mrs. A. G. Davis, 12^5
Adeline street, early this evening.
He had been working among the flow
ers in the garden at the rear of the Davis
residence, and while walking toward the
house in response to the supper bell sud
denly faltered and fell to the ground. Dr.
Akerly was promptly summoned and ad
ministered powerful restoratives, but to
no avail, for death had intervened.
Deceased was a native of Portland,
Me., aged 63 years, and came from his
native Maine over twenty years ago and
settled in Oakland. He was a newspaper
man of considerable ability, having been
at various times connected with the Oak
land Tribune and Enquirer. He was also
at one time employed in the Oakland
postoftice. Of late years he had devoted
most of his time, outside of his secretary
ship duties, to life insurance. He was
well known throughout this State not
alone for his abilities but also for his
cheerful and genial manner, his kind and
sympathetic heart and ever readiness to
do a friend a good turn.
Deceased leaves a widow, a daughter and
two sons, Fred A. Poor of the Connecti
cut Fire Insurance Company, and Joseph
Poor, who is a railway engineer in
Oregon.
An inquest will be held next Monday
evening, and the funeral arrangements
will be made in the meantime. â¢
KELLEY OF PRINCETON
REACHES BERKELEY
BERKELEY, Oct. 7.â Kelley, one of
Princeton's star football men, arrived at
the University of California this morning.
He was met at the Sixteenth street sta
tion, Oakland, by Garrett Cochran, the U.
C. football coach, and by Al Lean, trainer
of the Berkeley men. CochranT.ook him
over to San Francisco at once and the two
attended the Stanford-Olympic game this
afternoon. i. ,
Kelley is hardly second to Cochran in
his fame as a veteran of the gridiron.
When Cochran was at Princeton Kelley
played halfback on the varsity, team. His
work at the U. C. will be principally in
training the halfbacks on the Berkeley
varsity.. Kelley will make his first ap
pearance on the football field next Mon

work of the halfbacks until the end of the
season.
DEMURS TO SIMONS'
DIVORCE COMPLAINT
OAKLAND. Oct. 7.â Mrs. Augusta Si
mons to-day filed a demurrer to the com
plaint of her husoand, Anthony Simons,
In his suit for a divorce brought on the
grounds of cruelty. A motion was simul
taneously fik-d t" strike out portions of
the complaint. The case has been as
signed to Judge Greene's department of
the Superior Court, and the trial prom
ises to prove decidedly interesting, for
while Mrs. Simons admits that she is no
longer in love with Mr. Simons, and
though she Is not averse to a legal sep
aration, she does not propose to rest un
der the stigma that she has been cruel to
her husband.
CARS BLOCKADED BY
A HOLOCAUST OF HAY
OAKI^ANT*. Oct. 7.â An alarm rung In
early this evening was for a blaze of two
carloads of hay on the California and Ne
vada Railway at the crossing of Fortieth
street and San Pablo avenue. The de
partment responded promptly, but It re
quired some time to subdue the flames.
The hay was practically a total loss. For
over half an hour the San Pable avenue
electric cars were blockaded at the cross-

MORRIS A GEM
IN BAD SETTING
There's a gem of an old daguerreotype
at the Orpheumâ Felix Morris.
The costume matters not at all. It 1b a
gentleman-of-the-old-schocrt picture al
waysâa clearly outlined bit of aristocracy
treasured in the gilt and red velvet case
of quaintness.
The Hawaiian queens are painting* on
ivory â sweet pea colored miniatures. And
there the pleasure ends. The others on
the programme are harsh daubs splashed
in lurid pictures that "hurt." They
are better forgotten.
When Mr. Morris came westward the
last time he brought a support that was
positively bad. This season it is nega
tively good. May luck bring him hither
again with the kind of people he deserves.
His company handles "Behind the
Scenes" in a commonplace way and leaves
the fineness all to Morris. It is not an
aggressive group, though. They appear
comfortably reconciled to the fact that
the audience pays no attention to them,
and they go dutifully through their linos
in a way that bespeaks non-French chops
honestly earned.
There is to be a special season of farce
comedy at the Columbia, opening to-night
with "Hotel Topsy- Turvy." The farce
brings along with it Eddie Foy and a 100

the posted pictures Eddie is the same as
ever. "A Milk White Flag" and Mat
thews and Bulger will come later.
Nance O'Neil is back from London,
where she failed. She was the victim of
McKee Rankin and her own obstinacy.
I Even temperament needs wisdom at the

RULES FOR HEALTH AND BEAUTY
WHEREAS creams and lotions are
\, /? If frequently necessary adjuncts
\V\ff to one's beauty-getting efforts
there are other things quite as
Important.
There .are three great rules for beauty
1 and each rule consists of Just one word.
Diet is the first, bathing is the second and
exercise the third. These three combined
mean health and beauty .-is we all know
i la but a pleasanter word for this state.
Another thing to remember Is that the
truest, best beauty comes from within.
80, while you are correcting facial de
fects at the same time correct those of
the character and disposition. Cheerful
ness and a merry heart will do more than
i all the cosmetics in the world toward
beautifying the face and retarding the
approach of those horrors of the whole,
. petticoated race â wrinkles.
â¦ â¦ â¢
There has been such a demand for the
I formulas of the skin food and lotion for
I the hands that I will print them again
to-day for the last time, where all may
see them.
ORANGE FLOWER SKIN FOOD.
Spermaceti, one-half ounce.
white wax, one-half ounce.
Sweet almond oil, two ounces.
Lanolin, one ounce.
Cocoanut oil, one ounce.
Simple tincture of benoin, ten drops.
Orange flower water, one ounce.
Melt the first five Ingredients in a por
celain kettle. When thoroughly incor
porated remove from the lire and add the
orange flower water and the benzoin,
beating briskly with an egg-beater until
cold. Put in a little porcelain jar and
keep in a cool place.
This is to make wrinkles disappear. It
should be applied with the pYoper mas
sage just before retiring and after the'
faco has been bathed with warm water. ;
LOTION FOR THE HANDS.
Boak thirty grains of gum tragacanth
in seven ounces of rose water for forty
eight hours. Then strain forcibly through
I muslin an/1 add one-h;i!f ounce of
glycerin and alcohol which have been
previously mixed.
There is nothing better than this for the
hands. It dries immediately after being
applied and leaves the hands not the least
Lit greasy or etlcky.
I have also been asked for the recipe for
VIOL.ET SOAP.
White castile soap. 8 ounce*.
Honey, 1 ounce.
Spermaceti. 1 ounce.
Oil of sweet almonds. IV2 ounces.
Essence of violet, hi ounce.
Shave the castlle soup very fine. Put
the honey in a double boiler and when hot
i add the soap. In another double boiler
1 put the oil of almonds and the spermaceti
! and the wax, which have been grated fine.
When the soap is entirely melted pour the :
; oils and the soap together. Some-times it ,
may be necessary to add a little hot water
to the honey and soap, but be very spar-
Ing of it lest you weaken your soap so
: that it will not harden. Two tablespoon
fuls. at most, is quite enough. After the
! oils and the soap have been in the hot
water bath, which should be kept boiling
briskly for ten or fifteen minutes, remove
from the fire, add the essence of violets,
stir and then pour into teacups If you do
j not happen to have any molds handy.

Los Angeles.
Society suffered a great disappointment
on account of the wedding of Miss Mar
garet Winston of this city and William
C. Woodward of Chicago, which took
place on Thursday morning. It was ex
pected that there would be a big wedding
With a gr^at display, but instead the
couple, with a few of their nearest rela
tives, went to the residence of Rev.
Father Liebana. at the old Plaza Mission,
and were quietly married. After th<- cere
mony an elaborate wedding breakfast wai?
served by Mrs. Arcadia de Baker In her
apartments in ih<- Baker block. The bride,
who is a daughter of Mrs. Margaret Win
ston, is a native of Los Angeles and be
longs to one of the old historic Spanish
without In any way bleaching it Th.->
most delightful lotion In the world for the i
hands is made by soaking thirty grains 1
of pum tragaranth in seven ouncefl erf
rose water for two days. At the end of/
that lima strain it forcibly through I
cheesecloth or muslin, and add half an I
ounce each of glycerin .and alcohol, pre
viously mixed. However, it will be Im
possible for you to keep your hands in
good condition unless yon wear loose
gloves when obliged to work at the black
board.
ALI DA N.â lf the superfluous hair is
dark in color I would advise you to bleach
it with a little peroxide of hydrogen and i
ammonia. This will make it so lit<ht in .
color as to be scarcely noticeable. The <
electric: needle Is the only thing that will !
remove the hair permanently, and this
Is only practicable when the hairs are.
coarse and scattered. Boys who make
such remarks are rude and should be ig
nored. Increasing the size of the hu.-*t
and reducing are two entirely different
matters. The first can be done with per
fect safety, but all sorts of In furies can
come about by trying the remedies that I
are said to make the bust smaller. There j
is only one wholesome method of elimin
ating: fat, and that is by rigid dieting and |
proper exercise. A simple exorcise that I
will reduce the size of the stomach is to
lie flat on the back on the door with the
armr- folded, then raise the body to a sit
ting posture and let it fall back again
slowly. Repeat ten or fifteen times every
morning. Fastening the garters to the '
front of the. corset will also make the j
stomach appear less prominent.
ESSlEâ Nightly scrubbing with a com- j
plexion brush of good firm bristles, tepid I
water and castile soap followed by an ap- i
plication of cold cream, is the best treat- j
nient for blackheads. The following 10- j
tion is good also: Half pint of rose '
water, half a pint of orange flower water,
add drop by drop, half an ounce simple ,
tincture of benzoin, six minims tlnctun of
myrrh and a few drops of glycerin. :
Merely sponge the surface of the skin
lightly with the lotion. I fear I can sug
gest nothing for the down-growing locks
except persistent brushing upward.
CJENEVIEVEâ There Is no change more !
difficult to bring about than that of re
ducing the size of the hips. Electric
massages is perhaps the best way to over
come the trouble. If you cannot get the i
electric massage, then try the mechan
ical, which should he followed by a gen
tle rubbing with alcohol or salt and water.
K. E. O.â l think the following tonic
will help your hair: Witch hazel, one
ounce; alcohol, one ounce; water, half I
an ounce: resorcin, forty grains. Rub I
Into the scalp every night.
IDA S.â There must have been some ;
chemical in the stuff with which you w^re
scalded to have left brown blotches. A
physician could advise you better on this
point. I do not approve of epsom salts |
for the complexion. However, as you ask
for a formula, here is the only one I
have: Half a pint rain water, half a pint
rose water, two drams epsom salts, one <
dram aqua-camphor. Apply after bath-
Ing with a soft sponge.
BLACK-EYED SUSANâ The formula
for shampoo given in the foregoing letter
to Ruby A. is excellent for dandruff.
B. B.â Peroxide of hydrogen will bleach
the hair to any desired tint. Each appli
cation makes it lighter. Cocoanut oil will
not change the color of the eyebrows al
though it will give them a slightly darker
appearance.

the best-known Italian residents of this
city, and is in the form of a message of
congratulation from Marconi's country
men resident here to the great inventor.
It was telegraphed to the Ponce during
the course of the race, as was another
AGAINST OCEAN RAFT 3.
Ship-Owners and Pilots Will Fight
the Menacing Evil.
If It Is possible to serure legislation to
prevent the construction and towing of
log rafts the California Association of
Masters and Pilots of Steam Vessels will
do so. It will be remembered that the
last r.-tft from up the coast got adrift near
Eureka and was not sighted until found
down the roast near Port Harford, San
Luis Obispo County. During the two
weeks of its irresponsible drifting it was
a nightmare to the shipping community,
owners of vessels expecting to hear at
any time of their boats being wrecked
or foundered in consequence of a collision.
This raft was not the rlrst to be a menace
to navigation, for every one that has been
sent down the coast from the northern
ports has caused trouble of some kind.
The association mentioned, a year or bo
ago, attempted to secure legislation, but
was not successful. Two weeks ago a
meeting was held and preliminary steps
were taken to make an organized light
against the evil. During the past two
days the special committee has sent out
invitations to all of the commercial bodies
in this city asking that delegates be sent
to a meeting to be held on next Wednes
day eveninj in the ferry building at 8
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 8, 1899.
STANFORD AND
BERKELEY ABE
HAND IN HAND
Fraternize Over the
Festal Board.
A dinner was given last evening to
President Benjamin Ide Wheeler of the
State University at the Merchants' Club i
by President Jordan and the faculty of j
Stanford University. All the full and
associate professors of Stanford and the
State University were present and also
the following: Professor Henry Rolfe of
the University of Chicago, Timothy Hop
kins and Judge Leib of San Jose, trustees j
of Stanford; Lester F. Ward, the famous
sociologist and biologist of Washington,
D. C, and Mayor Phelan. There were
about eighty persona present. President
Jordan presided. All the speeches re
ferred to topics interesting especially to
university men.
Midway in the evening President Jor
dan arose and said: "I will request you
to drink a toast to Mrs. Heafst and Mrs. I
Stanford in silence, for I do not know of j
any words to express our sentiments
toward them." All drank in silence, j
When President Wheeler was introduced |
and arose to respond a rising toast was j
aiso drunk. Professor Joseph Le Conte â¢
was received with applause so long drawn i
out that he could not speak for several I
minutes. The speakers of the evening |
were: President Wheeler, Professor J. if. '
Stlllman of Stanford, Professor Joseph Le
Conte, Mayor Phelan, Professor W. H. i
Hudson and Professor Bernard Moses.
President Wheeler was in humorous :
mood and kept hla listeners laughing |
much of the time. He also called out j
enthusiasm when he spoke of beautiful
California and of the warm greeting that I
has been his. While the two university
presidents sat side by side at the head !
of the tables the professors of the two !
universities fraternized at various tabled. I
"There can be no enmity between the ]
University of California and Stanford j
University," said President Wheeler, j
"The only enemy that both must oppose I
is barbarism. There is rivalry between '
the two universities. I hear that there
Is a faculty baseball team at Stanford.
Very well, If President Jordan is good for
first base perhaps I can do the first base i
act myself. It might be a good idea for !
two faculty teams to give an exhibition in
San Francisco." This sally mightily j
pleased the younger Stanford professors ;
who play baseball.
"When I was about to come to Califor- j
nla," said President Wheeler a little far- ;
ther on, "I was told that what would
most impress me was the extent of the
country' I would pass over. 1 was Im
pressed also by the sage brush and the
great quantity of sand. It may be a good j
thing to persuade our faculty to devise a j
way to stimulate the use of sand and '
sage brush: the practical side of things
must be observed. A man crossed the :
Dakotas, climbing up one side of a de- '
tile and falling down another: crossing I
numerous streams; meeting all sorts of .
obstacles. }â â¢â  was heard to say, 'If the
world Is as uig t'other way as it Is the
way I came, then It Is a whopper.' I am I
so far away now that perhaps I will not
think of going back." All applauded this.
"This lovely land of Cnlifornla." con
tinued President Wheeler, "with Its
cheery sympathy and warm welcome,
seems like a well lighted room In a com
fortable home; and I feel at home in it
already."
President Wheeler told of humorouÃ al
legrd happenings among the faculty of
Cornell years ago. He thought that ho j
from Mayor Phelan. in response to the
one he received Thursday.
The second testimonial was in the shape
of a letter to The Call from Secretary Em
ery of the Merchants' Exchange, testify
ing to the completeness of the Marconi
bulletins posted by this paper at the ex
change.
Now will the yellow kid be food?
o'clock. The purpose Is to organize a
regular campaign against the rafting of
lumber and timber along the coast, and to
do this it will be necessary to take the
matter to Washington.
B/Â»staurant Man Dead.
Frank BisazzJ. a restaurant man, whose
j place of business was at S2l Kearny street,
and whose residence was at 728 Vallejo
street, died last evening at the Harbor
Hospital of apoplexy. He was found in a
! state of collapse in the ferry building
yesterday morning. Deceased had $700 in
Bold coin on hip person when he was
taken to the hospital.

TRANSATLANTIC STEAMERS.
LlZARDâ Passed Oct. Bâ Steamer La Tour
alnÂ«, from New York for HavrÂ«.
had never seen such an interesting collec
tion of wild animals. There was one pro
fessor who decided on the basis of figures
whether a student had passed the inebri
ety line by ascertaining how many drinks
he had had; then by figuring out the num
ber of ounces of alcohol and other in
gredients that he had absorbed; then by
estimating the effect upon the human sys
tem thai must ensue. When he had ftp
ured this all out with pencil and paper
he would vote to discharge or retain a
student suspected of being drunk entirely
an the basis of his mathematical totals.
One man judged whether the Glee Club
should be allowed to leave town on the
basis of science; another discarded sci
ence and determined wheth.-r a student
should go home to see his sister married
on the basis of researches in medieval
ism. No two professors were ever known
to agree on anything, and that made them
enjoyable to contemplate.
In serious mood President Wheeler
spoke of Andrew D. White of Cornell as a
shining light. Yesterday he had a letter
from Andrew D. White. One' passage in
the letter was: "If you and Jordan stand
together, Wheeler, you may be able to
do a great deal of good for civilization."
On this text President Wheeeler dwelt
long.

preliminary steps to properly arrange for
the celebration on the 9th of next Sep

A member of Halcyon Parlor asked that
the parlors of Alameda be represented In
the celebration.
It was stated that the meeting was one
of the presidents of the local parlors, and
that the matter of inviting representa
tives of other parlors was a matter of
consideration at a later date.
A motion prevailed that the president
of each parlor appoint a committee of
five to a convention to be held on the first
Saturday in December, when arrange- j
ments will be made to perfect a perma- !
nent organization.
It was also suggested that a presidents'
association should be organized, and to
that end M. A. Devine, F. T. Finch, G. B.
Stangenberger, J. M. Hanley and P. P.
Maussang were appointed a committee to
report a plan of organization at a meet
ing to be held on the 20th inst. -

Exports of Specie.
â Exports of specie from this port during: the
first nine months of the year were $16.775. 557,
against 139,396,24! for the same time In 1898,
and included $13,000 In gold bullion, $2,961,683
In stiver bullion, (1,891,573 in Mexican dollars,
1314.85S in silver coin. $11,361,200 in gold coin
and $177,197 In currency. Of this year's ship
ments $4,503,000 went to China. 717 to Japan,
!2."1C. 160 to Honolulu and $9,298,662 to New
York.
Dried Fruit and Salmon in London.
The I/^ndon Grocers' Gazette says: There has
been a fair amount of activity in Callfornian
fruits, especially in pears, which have appre
ciated considerably in value, Small overland
lots of Callfornian arriving, and quality is very
satisfactory- Quotations are well maintained.
The demand for salmon has been well main
tained, and Inquiries from distributors indi
cate that the stocks in their possession are get- I
ting low. Prices are firm, but half fiats are j
scarce, and likely to be dearer, while avail
able supplies of Fraser River tails are also
getting: short.
The Hay Market.
The circular of Scntt & Manner Fays:
"During the past week consignments of Hay j
have continued heavy and tne total receipts
here in the city foot up 6947 tens. What
changes there have been recorded in the market
since our last advices have all been against
the selling interests. Many of the city ware
houses, as well as the majority of the larger
consumers, are pretty well filled up. In view
of the Tact that there Is very much Hay in
the fields awaiting shipment to this market,
many of the interested parties look for lower
figures to prevail during the next few weeks.
We are still laboring under the disadvantages
of the scarcity of both rail and water freight
facilities, which is occasioning much annoy
ance and uneasiness to Loth the farmers and
the merchants here.
"Compressed Hayâ There are no changes to
note in this style of Hay. Arrivals have been j
coining forward fairly rapid, but the Hay hav
ing been arranged for before arrival, has been
taken enre of without burdening the market.
"Alfalfa Hayâ We quctod this cla.-s ot Hay ;
last week as being n. little lower. Since that
date rivals have continued to be very heavy,
and the market at this writing is lower arid
the feeling decidedly weak. It is calculated j
that large quantities of Alfalfa will continue to
arrive for some little time yet. Under the
present conditions unsatisfactory sales may be
anticipated."
Barley and Oats.
The circular of George Morrow & Co. says:
"Barleyâ Receipts for the week, 9?.C63 centals.
So far the exports of Barley exceed those of
Wheat for this season to date, and the outward
movement continues in a quiet way, although i
It iB, of course, hammered by the scarcity of
â¢hips. Exporters will still pay a slight ad
vence for very desirable lota of heavy bright ;
Barley, but the market for either brewing, ex- I
pvrt or feed Bariey cannot be called either
active or satisfactory to the holding Interests, I
nor can we discern anything In the near future
t> make It so. Certain It is, that California
raised a large crop of Barley this year, and a
good portion of it is yet to come in the mar
ket.
"O ATPâ Receipts for the week, 30,315 centals,
an increase of 10,000 centals as compared with
the previous week. The new crop of Oregon
Oats have at last made their appearance and a
fairly good line can be had upun future ship
ments. Almost all the valley Oats are more
or less stained. Eastern Oregon and Eastern
"Washington escaped the rain damage to some
extent, and we may expect some good Oats
from there. To holders of both stained and
bright Oats we would say that two things
must bo borne in mind, viz.: The stained Oats
are merchantable on this market and will sell
at a price, and secondly, the volume of stained
Oats shipped this way must of necessity nerve
a depressing effect upon the value of better
Oats.
"It is time for the seed demand for red and
black Oats to set in. and we do not look for
any decline in prices of same. On the con
trary, It would not surprise us to see a Blight
advance."

EASTERN MARKETS
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Oct. 7.â The stock market wai
much neglected to-day, tho yacht races prov
ing the eatMt fcttractlon. Prices moved
narrowly except in a few industrials aa! the
email traders had the market all to themselves.
They bid up prices after the opening In ex
pectation of a favorablo bank statement.
Prices declined when the statement appeared.
but there was no urgent liquidation and the
bidding up of Louisville to a point over last |
night steadied the market. The closing was
rather irregular. Attempts to still further de
press Brooklyn Transit met with resistance '
; and the stock gained a point. Changes gener- j
; ally are small and mixed, but the majority
; were gains. The bank statement failed to ;
] show large relief as a result of expenditures
by visitors to the Dewey celebration, which
had been much harped on by speculators all i
the week. Not more than a million dollars off- i
set to the drain to the Interior and to the |
BUb-treasury can be detected from the bank
returns. The reduction in the reserve require
ment by reducing loans (3,500,200 was not sum- i
cient to offset the loss In cash and the surplus ]
falls to $643,200. To-day's clearing-house state- .
ment shows the sub-treasury a debtor to that I
Institution for $2,091.3!Â»0.
Coupled with the receipt of gold by to-day's !
incoming steamers, this had the effect of j
contracting to a slight extent the unfavorable I
statement.
Prices of stocks arrived at a condition of
! stability during the week as compared with the
| violent fluctuations for some time past. This
condition represents the adjustment of values
! between the conflicting influences of stringent
money and prosperous business. What with
unwillingness to sell at present prices and
usual readiness to buy, the market has been
remarkably dull. It has not been narrow,
though the number of different issues dealt In
has increased and buying of odd lots has In
| dicated the presence of the bargain hunter.
Pressure to liquidation has not been heavy,
even when money rates were highest. ThÂ»
amounts loaned at the high rates, which were
40 per cent on one day and 35 per cent on an
other, were a small proportion and were caused
by eager bidding of belated borrowers who
had been dilatory about supplying their
needs from the early offerings, hoping for a
break In rates In the day.
The problem for the future Is, how much
farther the demand for crop moving purposes
will encroach on deposits of the Interior banks
with New York banks and on call loans of in
terior banks placed In Wall street. With the
Hank of England's official rate advanced to 5
per cent and weak returns from the great con
tinental banks, no further hope is entertained
of relief by gold Imports. Indeed, the convtc- j
tlon is general that any relaxation of the local j
money rate would result In a prompt demand
uprn is by London for gold. The movement of
the crops will continue to absorb money for
several weeks to .â¢â  me and the United States
Treasury's surplus of revenue over expendi
ture will continue to take money from the
open market unless means are taken to pre
! vent it.
Fionas have been dull and have moved In
sympathy with stocks. United States 3s de
cilned V new 4s *Â«. 5s J-, and old 4s % In the

Associated Banks' Statement.
NEW YORK, Oct. 7.â The changes In the
statement of the Associated Hanks of New
York for the week ending October 7 were
not as marked as had been anticipated. Instead
of average loss In loans of nearly seven mil
lions, and a decrease of ten millions In deposits
wn in the totals extending over the last
twelve weeks, the banks contracted loans for
th-^ current week ot only $3,590,200 and del
of $4,205,400. As the bank? have i st about $128,
-000,000 in deposits and $Ss.ooo.oCm In loans from
the high point attained in Jim- 5 tlu-re Is some
I for the belief that the period of ex
cessive liquidation is at an end. Still, the de
man 1 f r cash for Interior requirements
tlnues heavy, while the banks seem unaM-- I i
their resources from usual available
quarters. The gold engaged in London does
â  â  unt In the present statement, although
receipts from one or two other quarters ure
included. The receipts of sold on Saturday
alone were over $2,000,000. The Kreat difficulty
experienced this fall In financing- the crop
movement ran be traced to rhe losses which
the banks have sustained to the Treasury and
the bI wnees of the Continent to respond t >
- of gold to the usual Incentive of ris
ing interest rates here. Conservative opinions
favor the statement that the tide must turn
Boon, and that the general situation will im
prove, but there are bankers In New York
who aspert that even though the interior move
ment ceases soon, the flow of money on this
center asaln will be much Biowi r than usual
since business requirements warranted It 3 coÂ«-
I employment elsewhere. The gran I
m new on win be a factor
n it to be Ignored, and it is difficult to F"e
how the Bhlpment of gold this way is to he
avoided, even under the strain of untoward
circumstances abruad. As It is the banks
here are carrying a double burden and as
liquidation has ! â  I to an extreme
point there Is reason for expecting a change
soon. The operations of Â«n<s bank account
large part for current decreases. The pain In
Iprsls doubtless represents the heavy payments ,'
.ink following the holidays. The ap- :
parent reserve ever requirements Is at present ;
only $643,000, but this, of course, ts exclusive |
of the $2,000,000 of gold received Saturday, as
stated, but nut included In the averages.
London Market.
NEW YORK, Oct. 7.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says: |
The stock market here to-day was fairly brisk j
and cheerful owing to the slackness of news

Liberal party.

agreement with Portugal, in connection with
Qtrol of Delator Bay. lias been signed
and sealed and is to be submitted to I'ailia

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAQO, Oct. 7.â Some uncertainty was
rlio-wn by wheat at the opening. There was
nothing In the news to Justify a strong move
ment in either direction and the heaviness of
Friday's close was in consequence felt a lit
tle, though opening prices were unchanged. A
little later more disposition to buy developed
and the market gradually took on an appear
ance of firmness, prices advancing slightly and
maintaining the small advantage to the close
of tho short session. At the start there was
a little selling by the seaboard. As this Indi
cated lack of export demand it induced some
liquidation by local operators, but shorts cov
ered immediately at the slight decline that
resulted. The covering by shorts was one vi
the few important features of the session.
Though never heavy this buying was sufficient
to maintain prices. Another sustaining feature
was the lightness of Northwest receipts. ' The
market was also helped a little by the firm
ness of corn. Business dropped off greatly as
the session progressed and at the close the
market was almost at a standstill, but prices
were well maintained. World's shipments
were expected to reach 8,000,000 bushels and the
visible supply was expected to show a heavy
Increase. Winter wheat points reported a good
cash demand, with light country offerings. De
cember opened a shade higher at 72} B e. It sold
at 72%Â®72%c shortly after the opening, then
advanced to 72% c and was bringing 72% c at
the close. May ranged from 75%Â®75%c to 7534 c
and closed %@%c higher at 75%575%c.
Corn was rather quiet but firm. Offerings
were light and the demand followed, with more
outside trade. The falling off in receipts was
a bull factor. The trade is gradually getting
over Into May. December closed %c higher at
30*i@30%c. '
Oats were dull and about steady. Most of
the trade was in the way of evening up tran- ;
sactions. December closed a shade lower at j
22*45'22T4c. May closed at 24',4Â®24%c.
Trading In provision* was almost without in- |
cident. The general tone was steady and prices |
ruled a little higher. January pork closed 2%c j
hlrher and January lard and ribs a shade j
higher.

with the outside markets leading. There was
a good shipping and speculative demand. I It

Yesterday's reports from the pump were as
follows: "No. 1 elevator has been running con
tinuously. At 6:30 o'clock this morning the wa
ter was 24 feet 6 inches below the 1950-foot level
station. The new castings have arrived. Will
start this morning- taking out No. 2 elevator."
"There is net any danger of the water reach-
I Ing the 1960-foot level. To prevent wastage of
the pressure water we are required, when we
desire to stop pumping for two or three hours,
to give the water company two hours' notice,
that they may store the water. By the stop
pages made lately there has been a saving of
pressure water, and the water company desired
this. We will not permit the water to reach
the 1950 level."

DEMOCRATIC AXES ARE
OUT FOR MAJOR GEARY
Protests Against His Nomina
tion Filed With the Mayor.
Disaffection in the Local Party at the
Domination of Phelan Develops Into
Ugly Charges,
THE local nomocracy was in a I
trance yesterday. The roar and '
rowdyism of the closing scenes of (
the municipal convention were still
In the ears of the delegates and j
they were wondering how it happened
an.l what it was all about. Upon one
point, however, many of them ha.i i
reached an emphatic conclusion. hey â¢
are determined if possible to have Major
Dennis Geary dragged from the ticket. |
The opposition to the Democratic nomi
nee for County Clerk is bitter. The dis
affected delegates are circulating all sorts
of stories mid insist that for the sake of
the rest of the ticket Geary should be
compelled to retire He was stubbornly
fought in and out of the convention, and
now that lie has snatched the victory of
a â¢ mi Lion from his enemies they are
more than ever determined to make his
political horizon a gloomy one.
Major Geary is a political expedient. Ha
was nominated for County Clerk not for
any qualilicatior.s which he may possess,
but for certain vote-possessing elements
which he Is supposed to represent. When
liia name was first suggested by Mayor
PhAlaxi and Gavin McXab there was a
howl of Indignant protest, which the
Mayor and McXab ignored. Petitions
were sent to Mayor Phelan, but they were
of no avail: Democrats, seeking nothing
and asking nothing but the success or
their party, pleaded against the nomina
tion of Geary. But Mayor Pheian would
not listen. His friends argued with him,
but to no purpose. Ha had settled upon
Geary and hi a word was law.
The Mayor, as prime manipulator or
the affairs of the local Democracy, con
tended that the slate as arranged was
sadly deficient In two respects. As a vote-
Inducing instrument it was defective in
two particulars, which his Honor, in his
political wisdom, determined to correct.
He prklos himself upon his political abil
ity and he arrived at a conclusion, satis
factory to himself, that a Jew and a mili
tary man should be placed upon the mu
nicipal ticket as vote catch, Geary
was the military man chosen and Mayor
Phelan and McNab slated him for the
nomination of County Clerk.
The news of this arrangement was no
sooner circulated than protests began to
arrive at headquarters. The objections
were rot made in behalf of any other
candidate-, although there were several.
The objectors presented themselves as
Democrats to Mayor Phelan and pleaded
that Geary's record would not bear in
spection, and that any decent man would
be acceptable to them.
One of the first to file a protest was
Martin \V. Fleming, who was a supporter
of M. C. Haley, but for no stilish pur
pose. Fleming had been Chief Deputy
County Clerk under Haley, but now he
seeks no public office and will accept
none. Knowing Geary well, Fleming went
personally to Colonel â William P. Sulli
van, the secretary of Mayor Pheian, and
protested against the nomination of
Geary. Not satisfied with this, Fleming
sent i. letter of protest to Mayor Phelan
and gave what he believed to be good
reasons why Geary should not be placed
upon the municipal ticket.
"As a Democrat and a citizen," said
Mr. Fleming yesterday, "I protested in
person to Colonel Sullivan and in writ
ing to Mayor Pheian against the nomi
nation of Major Geary. I was in favor
of no particular candidate for County
Clerk. Brown, Baldwin, Haley or any
other decent man would have been ac
ceptable to me, for my only Interest in
the matter was a desire to see nominated
a good, clean ticket. I objected there*
fore to the nomination of Major Geary
because of my knowledge and estimate
of his character. My protests were ig
nored."
Mr. Fleming was not by any means the
last of the Democrats to plead with
Mayor Phelan not to force Geary upon
the convention. On Thursday last Mau
rice P. Loewensteln, one of the promi
nent younger men of the Democratic con
vention, called upon Mayor Phelan nad
gave his Honor an insight into Geary's
career as an insurance agent. Loewen
stein begged Pheian for the sake of the
local Democracy not to nominate the
major. The pleading fell upon deaf ears,
and on Friday night Geary was still the
slated candidate for County Clerk.
Mayor Phelan was In the convention
hall, and again Loewensteln and his
friends begged that Geary be withdrawn.
They insisted that his nomination would
be a serious Injury to the entire ticket.
But the Mayor was obdurate. He had
placed Geary on the slate and there he
would remain. The Mayor stood in the
wings of the stage and met the objectors.
Dr. Washington Dodgw, the nominee for
Assessor, pleaded with the Mayor to lis
ten to reason. Loewenstein threatened to
take the stage and ten what he knew
Isidor Gutte voiced his protest. Franklin
K. Lane, City and County Attorney,
begged, but it was all to no purpose, and

Of which saving seventh sense Mr.

The first thing I knew hi says. 'Here, I'll
have you arrested for doing that.'
"I wasn't conscious of spitting. But
there was some saliva on the floor about
as big as a 10-cent piece. I suppose I
must have put it there, but I'll be blessed
if 1 knew it. I told the fellow I didn't
mean to, but he called in a policeman.
"The policeman had to squint pretty
hard to find thp drop, but between the

Mr. Bradbury has your true disdain for
material wasted. Once on a time, he Jour
neyed to New York and registered at tha
Waldorf-Astoria. He was taken to a
room by a clerk. The room had a wains
coting of wood so highly polished that it
smudged It you looked at It. It pained his
carpenter instincts to see such wood
wasted on the human potpourri of. a ho
tel. "The clerk punched a button and a

bury. "You'd of thought he was dressed
for the opera, 'The gentleman will dine.'

button and swallow-tail number two

, "I looked at It and calculated that I
couldn't get my three square meals for
twenty dollars. There's been a time In my
life when I've spent less than that for a
month's living.
"I pass!" said millionaire Bradbury of
the West to the astonished swallow-tail
flunkeys of the East, and bag and um
brella he straightway moved from thÂ«
Waldorf-Astoria.
: Mr. Bradbury is not the only member
of his family who has diamonds. Not long"
since he acquired by right of mortgage a
pawnshop. The jewelry which ho could
not dispose of he gave to his wife- and
niece. They have a heterogeneous collec
tion of jewels found only behind the threÂ«
golden ball?.
Mr. Bradbury loves the spark 1 of thÂ«
diamond when It is clear. Bat unhappily
he cannot prevail upon his wife and niecÂ«
to string themselves on the flotsam and
jetsam that floats pawnshopward.
All of which has nothing to do with Mr.
Bradbury's sojourn in jail, but tells much
of the man. For William B. Bradbury,
ex-carper.ter. anti-Spring Valleylte and
millionaire expectorater, Is not cut altar

upward and outward. Wrinkles that
make a deep cleft in the flesh should be
lifted up and gently ironed with the tips
of the fingers.
The small vertical lines that com- be

'â "were necessary.
The balloon was built for the purely
scientific purpose of the trip. The diam
eter of the balleon when filled was about
sixty feet, Its circumference was 190 feet,
capacity 3000 cubic feet. It was made of
; Japanese pongee silk of great strength,
and â¢".as built in forty-eight meridional
chambers, consisting of no less than 3168
pieces of silk. The interior received six
coats of varnish and the exterior four
coats.' The covering net was made of
Anjou hemp treated with rubber, -with
21,504 meshes. The weight of the balloon,
with anchor, ropes and all, was 934 kilo
grams. The ballast, scientific Instruments
and passengers added 3096 kilograms, so
that the balloon had to lift 8090 kilograms
as It ascended in air. It required five days
to fill the balloon with gas, and then there
was a delay of three days before the
'â  weather appeared favorable. The wind
must be in the proper direction, and the
' air not too cloudy to prevent exact ob
servations. Pilot balloons were sent up
finally and showed that the wind set in
the proper direction to carry the. balloon
directly over the Alps and the Jura, I. c.,
southwest.
Four men held the ropes of the captive
balloon, ready to loose them at the sig
nal. The passengers climbed into the car
that swung beneath It and threw out
Hacks of ballast equal to their weight.
Captain Spelterinl cried "lachez tout"
(let go all) and the huge balloon majes
tically rose amid the shouts of thou
sands of spectators, for scientists had
come from all over Europe to see this
experiment. But let Professor Helm tell
of It In his own words:

when we would see the end of our mis

I endeavored to quiet them with inge

we were as I'ar as ever from escape. The

his men were losing their patience.
Of course, bad these fanatics not ob

In which a balloon had remained above
19,000 feet for hours at a time.
"The trip of the "Wega over the Alps
â was the 50"<1 successful ascension con
ducted by Captain Spelterini without ac
cident.
"We did not even feel dizzy." says
Professor Heim, "and our trip proved
that dizziness is not one of the ac
companiments of traveling by balloon, a
long mooted question. The most wonder
ful thing of all to us was the perfect
quiet and sacred silence of the heights.
Whether the balloon went up or down,
or ruEhed through the air with railway
speed, we felt none of it. "We were in ab
solute quiet. Then we knew what quiet
is. About 15,000 feet you hear the blood
rushing through your ears; at 18,000 feet
the noise of the circulation of your
is unbearable. It is altogether differ* I
from the stillness on a mountain top.
There is still the noise coming from be
low, even though brokenly. Bui with us
the silence was absoluteâ oppressive.
"Until we had ascended to 12,000 feet all
felt well. At 14.000 feet Dr. Biedermann
complained of palpitation of the heart.
At 1:^,000 feet Dr. Maurer- complained of
severe sticking pains in the back of his
head and of nausea.
. "At 18,000 feet and 20,000 feet I felt
â wonderfully well, sitting in one corner of
the car on a sack of ballast. Half dream-
Ing 1 looked out over the shining clouds,
or at the yellowish horizon, or upward
at the black- sky. I did not want any
oxygen, I felt no difficulty in breathing,
no uneasiness whatever, no *air hunger.'
But the ability to work was gone, my
energy was lost. It required a great ef
fort for me to take ray note book up and
write in it. My pulse was very weak, I
could hardly find it, but it was quietly
beating 60 to 63 times a minute. At all
once I felt freezing cold. But ie was so
delightful to sit there quietly. Better
to freeze than take the trouble to put
on the cloak that lay at my side. But my
conscience spoke, saying - iou ought to
observe, look around, note what you see!'
and I looked out, but I noticed nothing
and wrote not a word. Only to sit quietly
and ; let the balloon ascend to heavenly
heights, that must be a beautiful end!
"But â¢when we had descended 1500 or
1600 feet we were as new born. The -ef
fects of the rarefied air were felt only
while .we were in it. l . ;
faithful dogs were compelled to fast,
otherwise these Turks would have killed
us on the spot.
The eighth day ai rived, and after three
hours' walk the corporal, backed by his
rs, stopped and, addressing me
y. said: "Where are we and where
are we going to? We cannot resist any
mor< ; v.c are worn out. But before we

for our suffering." I realized then In a
glance my hopeless situation, but I re
plied to them with a bold voice: "I know
very well where we stand, and I can as
sure you that by to-morrow morning we
will reach our destination; if not, I leave
to your discretion my life."
The corporal and all the men accepted
these conditions, and we proceeded dcs
; our way.
The next day we were marching pain
fully along, making hardly one kilometer
per hour. I was completely exhausted.
My eyes were veiled by dizziness and in
a moment of extreme exhaustion I swayed
and almost fell.
The corporal Aly saw his opportunity.
A motion of his hand warned me of what
coming; nor was I mistaken. "This
is your last moment. Christian dog," came
in infuriated accents to my throbbing
lie drew his sword, but I was pre
pared. A bullet from my revolver passed
through his shoulder, felling him to the
gr. und.
That moment, as if in answer to the
shots, a trumpet's blast rang out on the
affrighted air. It 6tayed the murderous
hands of the corporal's soldiers, who were
red to avenge their leader. A few
â is later we were surrounded by a
B irian detnehmer.t of twenty soldiers,
commanded by Lieutenant Pennlff. who
was sent by the authorities to our res
cue.
We were at a distance of five kilomet
ers from Allar.-Kairak, where we ob
tained food and shelter.
"Strange to say, during all our trip
none of us felt the least desire for food.
"To describe the view from the balloon
is like trying- to describe a' symphony to
a deaf man. The woods Innked llkÂ« the
softest moss. The varying colors of the
foliage were clearer than ever, melting
into wondrous harmony. The lacework
of field and meadow, of fruit trees and
forests wove a woof of beauteous color.
All of the colors seemed far brighter from
the balloon, far fresher: and as we rosa
higher and higher ali took on a beauti
ful violet tint. The cities looked like mas
ter paintings, the streets like white
threads holding all together. If I could
tell all that I saw it would be my greatest
earthly pleasure, bur* language is all too
The coloring of the clouds, the
shadows on the mountains, what word*
can tell their beauty!"
"The birds, which appear from earth
to be near the highest mountain peaks,
never really fly very high. The atmos
above 7000 fret appears to he with
out a single inhabitant. There was not
a bird to be seen when we rose to 19,000
although we were over the valleys
in which the ravens are most common,
and I watched intently for a glimpse <rf
one.
"Above 16.000 feet the coloring of the
balloon and ourselves appeared to change.
The sun cast no warm yellow light on
us, but a pure white light, white to
ghastllness. All of the shadows were a
deep black. I noted the depth of this
shadow when I had to look for some
thing in a shaded corner of the car.
"If we looked first at the horizon and
then at the earth the former seemed to
be blue-vioitt, the latter a bright yellow.
The blue-violet coloring of the earth ap
peared at 16.000 feet and over. This was
explicable by the fact that the yellow
rays of the sunlight were absorbed in the
atmospheric covering of the earth as we
looked toward it. leaving the violet rays
in the ascendant. Seen from the moon,
the earth muit look violet. Looking at
mountains, distant not less than fifty
miles, they appeared a bright yellow. la
this case the white surfaces act as sources
of light behind the thick layers of at
mosphere, and the penetrating yellow
red light (reflected as blue) made the
distant mountains appear yellow to our
eyes,"

THE STRANGE STORY OF A MOST REMARKABLE FUGITIVE
I WAS getting tlr^d of the superiority
which I could not help feeling accrued
to Clarence from his posstsslng so
large a stock of personal reminis
cence and meeting with so many
strange adventures. His telling of nil
tlio.se wonders was interesting, no doubt;
but It seemed to me that adventures and
reminiscences of my oÂ«vnâ lf I could only.,
get themâ would be just as interesting
and might help to put me on a footing
of more equality with this remarkable
globe-trotter.
At last I thought I had hit upon some
thing worth tellingâ something thai Clar
ence would have to listen to, if only out
of sheer curiosityâ something I had <juite
recently found, and which would offset
that wonderful Australian yarn he ha>l
last told me about an old hat.
Accordingly 1 walked In on him one v,'f:t
Sunday afternoon, trying to assume the
very same air of nonchalant fullness of
matter with which he had introduced thai
Australian hat story. The attempt was
a failure.
"What's the matter with you?" Clar
ence asked; rubbing his eyes and stretch
ing hi legs; as he awoke from a nap in a
long reclining chair. "Been seeing the
thost of a Spanish grandee In armor W
"Something rarer than a ghost," 1 said,
trying to be calm.
"What is rarer* than a ghost?" be
asked. "Come to think of it, ghosts are
getting Quite common nowadays. Before
long you 11 be able to buy them in a de
partment store."
"That's right." I said. "My friendâ
our friendâ Simcox will turn them out by
the dozen. Bui I bet I've found some
thing you can't duplicate.' 1
"I take you," said Clarence, briskly
lumping up. "I take you, sight unseen.
Make it a hundred Havana fillers."
"Done," I . aid. "It's a man I hat really
doesn't want to make money."
"Oh, Lord!" said Clarence, contemptu
ously. "Have you found one of those
freaks? Well, you're getting on. my boy.
Only don't go and think the thing's alto
get her unique."
"1 suppose you met lots of them, eh?
In Ceylon; for instance?"
"Oh, ii" you're going to talk about Cey
lon," ho said, shrugging his shoulders,
"1 can find you scores of them there.
Why, look at nil the yogisâ [ thought you
meant in the civilized nationsâ the nations
that grab money as a steady thing."
"Such as?"
"Such as the American and the English,
where a man who really doesn't want any
more than he has is a freak. Even in
those countries I can match you."
I was so taken aback by Clarence's as
surance that for the moment 1 had noth
ing to say. He saw his advantage and
let fly his story at me before I could got
mine going.
"Why," he said, "I can tell you onÂ© in
stance right here in New York â or he was
here until he went to Nevada or some
Buch far country.
"It was through my name that I be
came acquainted with him. My name is

for a larger building-. It used to be called
the Sutherland; you may remember It.
There was a good billiard-room there and

ping tradr. Reduced In this manner many
times in hulk and weight they are sent
to countries both hot and cold for con
sumption there. The gold diggers of
Alaska are largely fed by these products;
an ever-increasing demand is coming from
that territory, and as the country opens'
up and becomes populated with Ameri
cans an enormous quantity will annually
lÂ»:-. sent there, sufficient to maintain many
farms in this State.
The same is true as regards the South
and the Orient. When the gold strikes
were reported in the Sierra Pinta country
in Lower California recently the miners
who left San Francisco for that place
supplied themselves liberally with evap
orated vegetables; parties who left about
the same time for Cape Nome did the
same, and the transports which sailed
out of the Golden Gate to furnish food
to the officers and men in the Philippines
had stored among their cargoes boxes and
catties of this same character of prod
ucts.
Owing to the increasing demand selec
tions have been made by individuals who
devote their time to growing a specimen.
This specialization is favored also by the
fact that when large areas of vegetables
are required particular localities of the
State and peculiar soils arc essential to
success. A soil that would grow lima
beans would grow celery, but it would
not grow celery successfully on a large
scale, and tho same thing may be said of
lima beans on celery soil. Consequently
it is found that the. celery growers gather
upon the heavy, moist peat lands about

'From his sick bed the patier; arose,
a crippled mass, a:. calmly looked at
the grave which had been dug for him
with cruel, unseemly haste. "It will fit
some other fellow," he said, and started
on the self-imposed journey that proved
him the pluckiest pedestrian that ever
stalked this or any other State.
Martin Low Is the name of the man
who took this journey under difficulties
that would have daunted Hercules. His
abode is here, there or anywhere that
his fancy leads him. He lives by rod
and spin: a crack fisherman and sure
shot, to which facts several medals at
test. At a meet for Santa Barbara, San
Luis Obispo and Monterey counties,
where were gathered the mighty hunts
men, this modern Robin Kood carried
of! all the honors for wing and target
shooting.
Martin Low was not born to the life
of the woodsman. His is a family that
has helped carve the destiny of the
State. The Lows have been influential
in political and social circles. His
uncle, Frederick Low, was Governor of
the State during the Civil War. Gov
ernor Low was noted as a man of stub
born, unyielding will. He used the veto
power to the full limit of the law. When
he started out to do a thing it was as
good as accomplished.
Martin Low is not less determined
than was hia distinguished uncle. He
?aid he wouldn't die, and he didn't: he
declared he would walk from Placer
viile to Tahoe City, and he did.
Time was when Martin Low was
himself a power in the little world in
which he lived. The Lows had inherit
ed from their father some money and
more real estate. His two older broth
ers bought cattle ranges in Arizona
and are r.w wealthy ranchers. Martin
had always been an unruly, adven
turous lad. At 13 he ran away from
hcme. and periodically thereafter they
killed the fatted calf for the return of
the prodigal son. However, his wild
oats were sufficiently tame to be for
givable and his' slice of his father's
estate was not withheld.

Martin Low was held a model young
man of the country round. He was a
happy enough cross between saint and
sinner not to be ruled out of any class.
He was superintendent of a Sunday
school, president of athletic societies,
paid his monthly dues 10 the temper

respects to a glass of lager. He made
no pretenses and a host of friends.
Mrs. Low converted her acres into a
seed and flower nursery and quaffed
the sweets of content. The youngest
darling of her. heart had forsworn his
Allan-a-Dale existence and was putting
his shoulder to the sober spokes in the
wheel of life.
One May morning Martin told his
mother that he was going to bring
home a daughter to the household.
Just over the edge of the county line,
a wee bit on the Monterey side, lived
the maiden of his choice. They were

him with tremendous force under the

between the wheels. The truck railed
pitilessly over his prostrate body.
They pulled him out, crushed and
mangled, the flesh on one leg ground
out deeply enough for a man's arm to
rest in the hollow. Death seemed so
certain that it was not thought worth
while to carry him to the nearest hos
pital at Placerville. At the end of a
week he was still breathing, so they
moved him to Placerville.
There the doctors and nurses did their
best, though they had no hope for his
- ry. He a: red that he was
not rea '.' t ~ kingdom come. So close
was he to death that the: - - -rave
for him. Martin Low heard that they
were preparing for his end and all the
stubbornness in him rallied to defeat
their purpose. From that day he began
to mend. In a month he was out of
the hospital, weak and limping.
His plans had been made to spend the
fishing season at Lake Tahoe. All his
money had been used paying hospital
expenses, and he was too proud to write
to his family or borrow from strangers,
blared his intention of walking
from Placerville to Tahoe. People said
he would never get there alive. That
settled it with Martin Low. He started
out to show them that he could.
For seven weary days he walked over
the rough mountain roads. Wagons
passed him now and then and a "lift"
was offered, but the jolting made walk
ing preferable. He fished and hunted
â I. ~x. "hanging some of his game
for milk and bread at the mountain
dairies he passed. He was not strong
enough to pack a blanker, so at night,
like the babes in the woods, he crept
under a covering of leaves.
Near the end of his journey he fell ex
hausted by the roadside a stone's throw
from a tollhouse. Mrs. Shaw, the toll
house keeper, was busy with her house
hold duties, while her two little girls
played outside. One of them discov
ered the prostrate form and peered into
his face with childish curiosity. "Why,
it's Martin." she cried, and his tired
eyes opened to her sweet, wondering
ones. She kissed him and then ran for i
"mamma."
Three months before Martin Low had
generously used his last cent to save j
the poor widow from being ejected from |
her house by a heartless landlord. Mar- j
tin How, In San Luis Obispo, had helped
the widow in her need, and on the dis
tant shores of Tahoe the bread which
he had cast upon the waters returned
to him. Friends had obtained this posi
tion of toll-keeper for Mrs. Shaw, and
she had never expected to see Martin j
Low again. She nursed him for a day ;
or two, and then he insisted on com- 1
pleting'his journey.
He finally' reached the popular resort
on the lake whither he had planned to
go against such terrible odds. His fame !
had traveled ahead of him and he was j
greeted with bonfires and wonderment.
Several physicians who were staying
there examined his thigh and leg and
declared their condition would make
twenty yards impossible to the average
man, yet Martin Low had "journeyed j
for a week.

/few Zealand Jfas
Some Strange
Customs.
New Zealand thirty years ago was
divided into six provinces (states).
There was intense rivalry between
them and between sections, which, led
,to subdivision of provinces.
Ten years ago began a bad financial
panic. Since then the whole tendency
has ' been toward centralization. The
state lines, so far as legislation is con
cerned, have been practically wiped
out, though the names are retained to
use for convenience.
No man, it is claimed, can starve la
New Zealand. An old-age pension pro
vides absolutely for the support of
every person of either sex past the a-ga
of working.
Any man can have land, by a law
somewhat similar to our own home
stead act. He does not have it in fee,
but upon a long lease.
For some time after the settlement of
New Zealand the natives were exter
minated like our own Indians. Thera
are only 41,000 left, but they are now
increasing somewhat.
New Zealand .- an agricultural
country of sparse population. Th- new
I legislation of lS'il and succeeding years
, : has levied taxation of two sorts on
land and on incomes. No attempt is
! made to collect tax on personality.
; The land tax is levied only on estates
\ worth $2500 or upward. Mortgages
' and some improvements are exempt.
On landed properties worth from $2500
I to $25,000 a tax rate is levied, varying
each year according to public needs. On.
estate worth more than $25,000 and up
to $50,000 an additional tax of .005 per
cent Is levied (one-eighth penny In the
pound). This differential tax increases
by a sliding scale until landed estates
worth $1,050,000 pay annually 1%. pence
to the pound, or about $7400, more in.
proportion than the estate of $25,000,
while the estate of less than $2500 paya
no-thing.
This law was made to break up largÂ»
landed estates and it has done it. They
cannot exist. As land becomes naorÂ©
valuable by the acre, estates of rnodr
crate size will be similarly broken, up*
As the price of land grows in proportion;
to density of population, this legislation
will subdivide the land more and more.
The law forbids the sale by auction^
of more than 320 acres in one plat.
â  The compulsory arbitration law, to*
troduced in 1891, was bitterly opposed*
It passed in 1894. It seema to work well.
There has been but one strike since.
Unions, of workmen and employers,
which register for the purpose, can vota

Arrangements for wages are made for
two years, so that employers know,
what they can figure on.
Union labor is not insisted upon In all
eases, but is favored by the arbitrators.
If a business has employed non-union
men they are neither forced out nor
compelled to join the union. Nowhere
else, however, are labor unions
stronger.
New Zealand has an eight-hour day,
a half -holiday every week, a dozen full
holidays in the yearâ all at full wages.
Less drunkenness and more thrift are
said to result from this law.

-# I beth Klurrpke, has fallen luir to
Iâ l the proparty of Rosa Bonheui the
V, I famous rainter of animals. A
X warm bond of affection existed
between the two for many years, which
was severed only on the death of the'
famous Frenchwoman! During th( last
two years of the lattor's life Mi:-s
Klumpke was her constant companion at
the. Chateau de By, a magnificent resi
dence on a commanding eminence In the
famous forest of Fontainebleau, for gen
orations the chosen haunt of landscape
painters. About the chateau which the
Calif or nlaq inherits roam the dumb beasts
that Rosa Honheur used as models In her
lifelike paintings.
That Rcsa Bonheur was an admirer of
Miss Klumpkt's ability as an artist was
borne out by the deep interest she mani
fested In the studies and career of the
American artist. Shortly before her death
she consented to sit for a portrait of her
self by her pupil. When finished the
pain:.. was exhibited in the last Salon
and received high . commendation. This
portrait of the renowned animal painter,

palette, was photographed and published
In the leading': illustrated periodicals
throughout the world. Rumor has it that
the French Government Intends buying it.
as it is the last and best picture made of
Bonheur.
Miss Klumpke is one of a group of re
markable sisters. She Is the eldest and is
considered by her brilliant sisters the
it.of: distinguished in the family. Anna
is said to be CO years old and Is the eldest
daughter. Augusta is two yearn younger
and is ... physician of high standing and
the wife of one of the most distinguished
practitioners in France. A third sister,
Dorothea, Is emulous of the fame of Mrs.
Somerville. the celebrated English mathe
matician and astronomer. Matilda, who
â¢was next in point of age, but who is now
dead, would have created a name for her
self In the musical world had she lived,
as she was a piano player of exceptional
ability. While attending the Conserva
tory of Music in Paris she won second
prize In competition with a score of
other clever students and was also the fa
vorite pupil of one of the masters. The
youngest of this quintet of marvelous
girls, Julia, who has Just reached her
twentieth birthday, has won celebrity as
a virtuoso. For many years she was a
pupil cf Tsaye and was highly praised by
him for her playing on the violin. She Is
also a clever performer on the zither. The
mother of these girls is a sweet-faced,
gray-haired woman, who Idolizes her
children. She has devoted her fortune to
their education and she has lived to sco
the fruition of her labor of love. She Is
now residing in Paris with her children,
who are devoted to their parent.
California enjoys the distinction of being
the native State of this famous family.
John <;. Klumpke, who now resides on
the corner of Chestnut and Larkln streets,
is the father of these girls. He was sep
arated from his wife many years ago.
The girls were born near the Mission and
left San Francisco in 1871, since which
time they have lived in Germany and In
Paris, where they finished their educa
tion.
The history of Miss Anna Klumpke's
Buccess Is one of indefatigable study and
hard work. On leaving this country Miss
Klumpke pursued her studies In Germany
for a number of years, and then, accom
panied by her mother and sisters, Jour
neyed to Paris. She there entered the
famous Jullon Academy and received in
struction from "&. iTe Vfllerroy. Jony-
Robert Fleury. Jules Le Febvre and Wil
liam Bouguereau. That she profited by
their teaching was apparent by the rapid
strides :-he made in her chosen profession.
One of her drawinps was exhibited in 1882,
and won her a silver medal and praise
from her critics. During the next four
years she bent all her energies to her
work, and as a result success followed
success in quick order. In 1885 she re
ceived honorable mention at the Paris
Salon, a silver medal at Versailles, grand

In IS-:' Mi:;.- Klumpke visited her native
country and exhibited a splendid picture
at the Academy of Arts in Philadelphia
entitled "In the Washhouse." This pic
ture, which took ttau gold medal, shows a
proup of industrious workers in quaint
costume, with earnest faces, intent on
their Kabor. , Another picture painted by
the artist is called "Scheherazade," which
was hung at the salon last year and won
the highest praise from art connoisseurs.
The figure In the picture is a striking- one.

Among the special and other exhibitions

were as follows: Annual exhibition at
Rouen; Versailles Museum; St. Botolph
Club and Art Museum. Boston; World's
Fair, Chicago; Nashville Exposition, and
the Mark Hopkins Institute of Art in
July, 1897.
A great deal was said in the papers
when Miss Augusta Klumpke was ap
pointed an interne In one of the' Paris hos
pita!?. At that time there were 108 women
studying medicine in Paris. .Of these,
curiously enough, more than half were
Russian", while not half a dozen were
Americans. Despito this fact Miss
T^t
Klumpke was the successful competitor.
She was established in a hospital of
ninety patients, making two visits a day
and her night watch at stated intervals,
at which times she was entirely respon
sible for the management of the placs.
Her advent was not hailed with acclama
tion by the male intern* s, because of the
prejudices that then existed against wo
men entering the profession, but she ma
terially decreased this feeling by her ac
tivity and ability. She received her edu
cation in Switzerland and completed it in
Paris. She was the nrst woman to be
received as an interne in a French hos
pital and won a gold medal in competition
with three hundred students by writing
an able treatise on nervous diseases. She
was married to Dr. Dejerino, a member
of the faculty of medicine in one of the
leading institutions In Paris. Both are
now practicing their profession and have
a long list of patients.
Dorothea Klumpke won her way into
the Paris AFtronomlcal Observatory over
the heads of fifty Frenchmen who were
competing, and she now has charge of the
department which computes the measure
ments of the stars in the Paris belt. She
works eagerly from 9 o'clock in the morn
ing till 5 o'clock in the afternoon, and
frequently at night she stays up in the
round tower with her telescope turned
searchingly upon the stars. Miss Klumpke

"My bad hsa'.l for figures has always

Miss Dalglish's eyes flashed and she

"It must be born in usâ this age ques

aftor having a quarrel with a little friend.
She described t.*e disagreement and
wound up by saying: 'I wouldn't have

goesâ yes, she certainly is .i good actres.-,

usually is possessed of, if nothing else can
be found against her, the years of Methu
selah, or some other petty deficiency. I
wonder sometimes if women hate to see
a sister climb to the top of the ladder:
To hear her lauded and praised and ad

that in our eyes greatness is dimmed
by It?

"Yes. and the beginn'ng of a new era
My professional career up to now has
been thorough, bufinsignificent of inter

greatest privilege, the greatest privilege
any one could have, to continue it under
Modjeska. To meâ yeaâ there are stars
many, many stars, but there Is "but one
Modjeaka. To excel her impossible â to
equal her the dream of my life. From
now on I owe everything to her. The tri

make, will be due to her. Due to my fol

woman and our greatest artist.
"My future? My future Is simply, a mat
ter of destiny. I drift. I make no plans.
Accept what comes and work to do what
1 may do. I leave it to the stars," laughed
Miss Dalglish. "I driftâ we all drift."
"Brilliant, talented and will make a
great name for herself," Is what people
who know say of Modjeska's leading lady
â Kate Dalglishâ and I believe them.

MARJORY WATXYVRIGHT falla In love with Rufus Coleman, Sunday editor
of the New York Eclipse She tolls her father. one of the most learned
professors In a srect Eastern college, of her Intention to marry Coleman.
and in spite of tie fact that â¢â -.r.an was at one time a favorite pupil the
match la moat bitterly opposed by him. He arranges a trip to Greece, hoping to
prevent the wedding. Coleman call? on Marjory for en answer to his suit. To
try his affection she treats him coldly and announces her trip to Greece. He
misunderstands, and the result is they say goo<l-by in a most matter of fact
manner, but. Marjory rushes in tears to her father, fully convinced that Coleman
doe^ not love her, while Cole! (toes to the chin and drowns his grief in
drink. The professor arranges to ta!;e some o( ills students with his family to
Greece â among them a young Bophomore named Coke, v.'ho has distinguished him
self In a freshman rush and is regarded by Coleman in the light of a rival. Cole
man gets an appointment as war correspondent of the Eclipse for the war In
Greece and sal.:! via London. On the steamer he meets Nora Black, a celebrated
dancer and en old friend, who pays him marked attention. .
Coleman rather slights tl;e attentions of the fair Nora and In turn Is himself,
snubbed, lie leaves London without telling her good-by, although she Â»lts Rear
him at Buppfr, an 3 from remarks she ikes to her party he knows ehs is fond of
him. In Greece he learns that the Walnwrlght party aie at Nlkopolis and In dan
ger, so hÂ« sets cut for that point at once.
Colernun llr.is the approach to Nlkopolis surround' i*. with difficulties and no
trace of the Wainwishts. He receives a cablegram from the Eclipse to ascer
tain the whereabouts of the party at all hazards, as their position had already
created considerable comment in America.
He proceeds with a portion of the Greek cavalry toward Nlkopolis. The Greeks
hear of reverses and suddenly retreat, leaving Coleman and his dragoman to get
back the beat way they can. Night cornea on. and by a queer chance the Wain
wrights overtake Colf-man on the road. They are unarmed and in a state of
trepidation. All are In danger of massacre by either Greek or Turkish hillsmcn
and the burden of taking the party to safety falls on Coleman. Thf- party proceeds
on Its way to Ana and meet.-' the Greek outpost, but learns of further dangers
ahead. To the surprise of all they meet Nora Black with a party on the road.
Ccleman and party reach" the Grecian settlement in safety. Nora Black begins
to mcks trouble. Oman dines alene with her and is afterward accused by
Coke of having made love to her and been repulsed. A row ensues, which la In
terrupted by the Interference of the professor and the college students.
The professor and students take Colemar.'a rart. Coke sulks and will not
breakfast with the party. He meets Nora Black and Is asked by her to ride in
her carriage to Athens.
The party proceeds without Coke. They have a skirmish with peasants outside
of a roadside inn. Coleman is s-Hghtly wounded and in consequence he and Mar
jory again declare th Ii love for eaoJi other. Coke and Nora Black arrive at the
Jnn and Nora assumes propri<toish!p of leman In such a way that he becomes
enraged, pettishly lea-yes the Wainwrights and proceeds on his way alone to the
railroad. At the station he is delayed and sees the other party drive up, with his
rival, Coke, by Marjory's side.
Coleman is forced to travel with the party to Athens'. On the way he endeavors
to explain to Mar; â  The result is a misunderstanding. Marjory confides to her
father that she Btill loves Coleman devotedly and is heart-broken.
-.. . _
Once at dinner the Minister launched immediately into the subject of
Colcn.an. "lie must be altogether a most remarkable man. When he told
me very quietly that he was going to try to rescue you I frankly warned
him against any such attempt. I thought he would merely add one more
to a party of suffering people, But the boys tell me that he did actually
rescue you."
"Yes, he did," said the professor. "It was a very gallant performance
and we are very gratefuL"
"Of course," spoke Mrs. Wainwright, "we might have rescued our
selves. We were on the right road, and all we had to do was to keep
going on."
Yes-, but I understandâ" said the Minister. "1 understand ho took you
Into a wood to protect you from that tight, ana generally protected you
from all kinds 01 rouble^ 11 seems wonaerful to me not bo much because
it was done as because it was done by the man who me time ago calmly
announced to me that he was going to do it. Extraordinary."
"Of course," said Mrs. Wainwright. "Oh, of course."
"And where is he now?" asked the Minister suddenly. "Has he now
left you to the mercies of civilization?"
There w:m a moment's curious stillness, and then Mrs. Wainwright
used that high voice whichâ students believedâ could only come to her
when she wa.s about to say something peculiarly destructive to the sensi
bilities. "Oh, of .course, Mr. Coleman rendered "us a great service, but In
his private character he is not a man whom we exactly care to associate
with."
"Indeed!" said the Minister, staring. Then he hastily addressed the
students. "Well, Isn't this a comic war? Did you ever Imagine war could
be like this?" The professor remained looking at his wife with an air of
stupefaction, as it she bad opened up to him visions of imbecility of which
he. had not even dreamed. The students loyally began to chatter at the
Minis! "Yes, sir. it is a queer war. After all their bragging, it is
funny to hear that they "are running away with such agility. We thought,
cf course, of the old Greek wars."
Later the Minister asked them all to his rooms for coffee and cigar
ettes, but the professor and Mrs. Wainwright apologetically retired to their
own quarters. The Minister and the students made clouds of smoke,
through which pang the eloquent descriptions of late adventures.
The Minister had spent da: of listening to questions from the State
Department at Washington as to the whereabouts of trie Wainwright
party. "I suppose you know that you are very prominent people in the
United States just now? Four pictures must have been in all the papers,
and there must have been columns printed about you. My life here was
made almost insupportable by your friends, who consist, I should think,
of about half the population of the country. Of course they laid regular
eiego to the department. I am angry at Colt-man for only one thing. When
he cabled the news of your rescue to his newspaper from Arta he should
have also wired me, If only to relieve my failing mind. My first news of
your escape was from Washingtonâ think of that." ,
"Coleman had us all on his hands at Arta," said Peter Tounley. "He
was a fairly busy man."
"I suppose so," said the Minister. "By the way," he asked bluntly,
"what is wrong with him? What did Mrs. Wainwright mean?"
They were silent for a time, but it seemed plain to him that it was not
evident that his question had demoralized them. They seemed to be delib
erating upon the form of answer. Ultimately Peter Tounley coughed be
hind his hand. "You see ,sir," he began, "there isâ well, there is a woman
in the case. Not that anybody would care to speak of it excepting: to you.
But that is what is the cause of things, and then, you see, Mrs. Wain
wright isâ wellâ " He hesitated a. moment and then completed his sen
tence In the ingenuous profanity of his age and condition. "She is rather
an extraordinary old bird."
"But who is the woman?"
"Why, it is Nora Black, the actress,"
"Oh, cried the Minister, enlightened. "Her? "Why, I saw her hare.
She was very beautiful, but she seemed harmless enough. Sha was some
whatâconfident, perhaps, but she did not alarm me. She called upon
me, and I confess Iâ why, she seemed charming."
"She's sweet on little Rufus. That's the point," said an oracular voice
"Oh," cried the host, suddenly, "I remember. She asked me where he
was. She said she had heard he was In Greece, and I told her ho had gone
knight-erranting off after you people. I remember now. I suppose sh<"
posted after him up to Arta, eh?"
"That's It. And so she asked you where he was?"
"Yes."
"Why, that old flamingoâ WalnwriÂ»htr-inslsts that It was a ren
dezvous."
Every one exchanged glances and laughed a little.
"And did you see any actual fighting?" asked the Minister.
"No. We only heard itâ"
Afterward, as they were trooping up to their rooms, Peter Tounley
epoke musingly. "Well, 11 looks to me now as if Old Mother Walnwrieht
was just a bad-minded old hen." â 
"Oh, I don't know. How is one going to tell what the truth is?"
"At any rate, we are sure now that Coleman had nothing to do with
Nora's debut in Enirus."
They had talked much of Coleman, but in their tones there always had
been a note of indifference or carelessness. This matter, which to Â«ome
people was as vital and fundamental as existence, remained to nthers~who
knew of it only a harmless detail of life, with no terrible powers and Its
Significance had faded greatly when had ended the close associations of
the late adventure.
After dinner thÂ© professor had gono directly to his daughter's room
Apparently she had not moved. He knelt by the bedside again and took
one of her hands. She was not weeping. She looked at him and smiled
through tha darkness. "Daddy, I would like to die," she said. "I think
âyesâ l would like to die." â -â â¢.â¢-. .
For a long time the old man was silent, but ho arose at last with a
definite abruptness and said hoarsely, "Walt!" .
Mrs, Wainwright was standing- before her mirror with her elbows
thrust out at angles above her head, while- her fingers moved In a disar
rangement of her hair. In the glass she saw a reflection of her husband
coming from Marjory's room, and hiÂ« face was set with some kind of
alarming purpose. She turned to watch him actually, but he walked to
ward the door into the corridor and did not in any wise heed her "Harrl
eon!" ("he called. here are you going?" ;â¢
He turned a troubled face upon her and as if she had hailed him In his
Bleep. He vacantly said, "What?"
"Where are you going:?" she demanded with increased trepidation.
He dropped heavily into a. chair. "Going?" he repeated.
She was angry. "Yes! Going! Where are you going?"
"1 arr goingâ' he answered. "I am going to see Rufus Coleman."
Mrs. Wainwright gave voice to a muffled scream. "Not about Mar
jory?" .'â >
"Yes," he said, "aTTout Marjory."
It was now Mrs. Wainwright's turn to look at her husband with an
air of stupefaction as !f he had opened up to her visions of imbecility of
â¢which she had not even dreamed. "About Marjory!" she gurgled Then
suddenly her wrath flamed out. "Well, upon my word, Harrison Wain
wright, you are. of all men in the world, the most silly and stupid You
.- n absolutely beyond belief. Of all projects! And what do you think
Marjory would have to say of it If she knew it? I suppose you think she
would like it. Why, I tell you, she would keep her right hand in the fire
until it was burned off before she would allow you to do such a thing"
"She must never know It," responded the professor in dull misery
"Then think of yourself! Think of the shame of it! The shame of it!"
The professor raised his eyes for an ironical glance at his wife "Oh
â¢ â¢ I have thought of the shame of it!" â¢ '
"And you'll accomplish nothing," cried Mrs. 'Wamwriirht. "You'll ac
complish nothing. He'll only laugh at you."
"If he laughs at me he will laugh at nothing but a poor, weak un
worldly old man. It Is my duty to go." " '.., .-.-.! ? Â« - â <;
Mrs. Walnwrlght opened her mouth as If she was about to Â«hrtek Vfter
choking a moment she said: "Your duty? Your duty to go and bend the
knee to that man? Your duty?"
" 'It Is my duty to pro.' " he repeated humbly. "If I can find even one
chance for my daughter's happiness Ii a personal sacrifice. He can do no
more thanâ ho can do no more than make me a little sadder."
His wife evidently understood hla humility as a tribute to her areu
ments and a cleer Indication that she had fatally undermined his orljrlnal
Intention. "Oh. he would have made you sadder." she quoth grimly. "No
fear! Why. it was the most Insane lflÂ«*a I ever heard of."
The professor arose wearily. "Well. I must be going to this work It
Ib a thing to have ended quickly." There was something almost biblical in
his manner.
"Harrison!" burst out hiÂ« wife in amaaed lamentation. "You are not
really going to do it? Not really?"
"I am going to do It." ho answered.
"Well, there!" ejaculated Mrs. Wair.wrtght to thÂ© heavens. She was so
to speak, prostrate. "We!!, there!"
As th" professor passed out of the door she cried beseechingly but
futilely after him. "Harrison!" In a mechanical way she turned then back
to the mirror and resumed the disarrangement of her hair. She addressed
her Image. "Well, of all etupid creatures under the Bun, men are thÂ»

very worstl" And hr-r Imago said this to lur even as she informed It, and
afterward thej stared at each other in a profound and tragic recep-tion
ceptai â of this great truth.
Presently she begun to consider the advisability of going to Marjory
with the whi le story. Really Harrison must not be allowed to go on blun
dering until the whole world heard that Marjory was trying to break her
heart dv< r th it common scamp of a Coleman. It seemed to be about time
for her, Mrs. Wainwrfght, to come into the situation and mend matters.

out his hand. He had laid aside his pipe and had also been very success

was a feat of deference to the professor's well-known principles.
"Won't you sit down, sir/" said Cult-man cordially. His quick glance
or surprise had been immediately suppressed and his manner was now as

"Thank you, Mr. Coleman, yes, 1 will sit down," replied 'the old man.

"Yea, Blr." v
He halted then and passed his hand over his face. His eyes did not
seem to rest once upon Coleman, but they occupied themselves in furtive
and frightened glances over the room. Coleman could make Neither head
nor tail of the affair. He would not have believed any man's statement
that the professor could act in such an extraordinary fashion. "Yes, sir?"
he said again, suggestively. The simple strategy resulted in a silence
that was actually awkward. Coleman, despite his bewilderment, hastened
Into a preserving gossip. "I've had a great many cables waiting for me

night. You have no Idea of the row in America, professor. "Why, every
body must have gone wild over the lost sheep. My paper has cabled some
tilings that are evidently for you. For instance, here is one that says a
new puzzle game called 'Find the Walnwrlght Party' has had a big suc
cess. Think of that, would you?" Coleman grinned at the professor.
" 'Find the Walnwright Party.' a new puzzle game."
The professor had seemed grateful for Coleman's tangent off 'into mat
ters of a light vein. "Yes?" he said, almost eagerly. "Are they selling a
game* really called that?"
"Yes, really," replied Coleman. "And of course you know thatâ erâ
Well, all the Sunday papers would of course have big Illustrated articles
full pagesâ your photographs and general private histories pertaining
mostly to things which are none of their business?"
â¢'Yes, 1 suppose they would do that," admitted thÂ« professor. "But I
dare say it may not be as bad as you suggest."
"Very like not," said Coleman. "I put it to you forcibly so that in the
future the blow will not be too cruel. They are often a weird lot."
"Perhaps they can't ilnd anything very bad about us."
"Oh, no. And besides the. whole episode will probably be forgotten by
the time you return to the United States." y
They talked on this way slowly, strainedly, until they each found that
the situation would boon become insupportable. The professor had come
for a distinct purpose and Coleman know it; they could not sit there lvine
at each other forever. Yet when he saw the pain deepening in the pro
fessor's eyes the correspondent again ordered up his trivialities "Funny
thing. My paper has been congratulating me, you know, sir, in a whole
sale fashion, and I thinkâ l feel sureâ that they have been exploiting mv
name all over the country as the Heroic Rescuer. There Is no sense in
trying to stop them, because they don't care whether It is true or not true
All they want is the privilege of howling out that their correspondent res
cued you, and they would take that privilege without in any wav worry
ing if I refused- my consent. You see, sir? I wouldn't like you to "feel that
1 was such a strident idiot as I doubtless am appearing now before the
public." .
"No," said the professor absently. It was plain that he had been a
very slack listener. "Iâ Mr. Coleman â " he began.
"Yes, sir?" answered Coleman promptly and gently '
It was obviously only a recognition of the futility of further dallvln*
that was driving the old man onward. He knew, of course, that If he 'was
resolved to take this step a longer delay would simply make it harder for
him. The correspondent, leaning forward", was watching him almost
breathlessly.
"Mr. Coleman, I understandâ or at least lam led to believeâ that youâ
at once time proposed marriage to my daughter?"
The faltering words did not sound as if either man had aught to do
with them. They were an expression by the tragic muse herself. Cole
man s Jaw fell and he looked glassily nt the professor. He said, "Yes 1 "
But already his blood was- leaping as his mind flashed everywhere in specu
lation. . â  â 
"I refused my consent to that marriage," Bald the old man more easily.
THE SUNDAY CALL.
"I do not know If the matter has remained Important to you, but at any
rate Iâ l retract my refusal."
Suddenly the blank expression left Coleman's face and he smiled with
sudden Intelligence as If information of what the professor had been say
ing had just reached him. In this smile there was a sudden betrayal too,
of something keen and bitter which had laid" hidden in the man's mind.
He arose and made a step toward the professor and held out .his hand.
"Sir, I thank you from the bottom of my heart!" And they both seemed
to note with surprise that Coleman'a voice had broken.
The professor had arisen to receive Coleman's hand. His nerve was
now of iron and he was very formal. "I judge from your tons that I have
not made a mistake â something which I feared."
Coleman did not seem to mind the professor's formality. "Don't fear
anything. Won't you sit dow>n again? Will you have a cigar? â¢ â¢ No, I
couldn't tell you how glad I am. â  How glad I am. I feel like a fool. â¢
But the professor fixed him with an Arctic eye and bluntly said, "You
lovÂ« her?"
The question steadied Coleman at once. He looked undauntedly straight
Into the professor's face. He simply paid, "I love her!"
"You love her?" repeated the professor.
"I love her," repeated Coleman.
After some seconds of pregnant silence the professor arose. "Well, If
she cares to give her life to you I will allow It, but I must say that I do
not consider you nearly good enough. Good-night." He smiled faintly as
he held out his hand.
Good-night, sir." said Coleman. "And I can't tell you howâ"
Mrs. Walnwrlght, in -her room, was languishing in a chair and apply
ing to her brow a handkerchief wet with cologne water. She kept her
feverish glance upon the door. Remembering well the manner of her hu3
-1 anil when he went out, she could hardly identify him when he came In.
Serenity, composure,' even self-satisfaction, was written upon him. He
paid tio attention to her, but going to a chair sat down with a groan of
contentment.
"Well?" cried Mrs. Walnwright, starting up. "Well?"
"Wellâ what?" he asked.
She waved her band impatiently. "Harrison, don't be absurd. You
know perfectly well what I mean. It Is a pity you couldn't think of tha
anxiety 1 have been in." She was going to weep.
"Oh. I'll toll you after a while." he said, stretching out his lego with
the complnrency of a rich merchant after a succi ssful day.
"No! Tell mo now." she implored him. "Can'i you see I've worried my
self nearly to death?" She was not going to weep; she was going to wax
angry.
"Well, to tell the truth," said the professor, with considerable pompos
ity, "I've arranged it. Didn't think I could do it at first, but it turned
outâ"
" 'Arranged it'?" wailed Mrs. Wainwright. "Arranged what?"
It here seemed to strike the professor suddenly that he was not such a
flaming example for diplomatists as he might have imagined. "Arranged,"
he stammered. "Arrangedâ"
"Arranged what?"
"Why. i fixed â r fixed it up."
"Fixed what up?"
"Itâ itâ " began the professor. Then he swelled with Indignation. "Why,
can't you understand anything at all? Iâ l fixed it."
"Fixed what?"
"Fixed It. Fixed it with Coleman."
"Fixed what with Coleman?"
The professor's wrath r.ow took control of him. "Thunder and light
enln'! You seem to jump at the conclusion that I've made some horrible
mistake. For goodness' sake, give me credit for a particle of sense."
"What did you do?" she asked in a sepulchral voice.
"Well," said the professor, in a burning defiance, "I'll tell you what I
flirt. I went to Col-man and told him that onceâ as he of course knew â I
ha"d refused his marriage with my daughter, but that nowâ"
"Grrr!" said Mrs. Wninwrlght.
"But that now" continued the professor "I retracted that refusal."
"Mercy on v: â '." ni -<l Mrs. Walnwright, throwing: herself back in the
chair. "Mercy on us: what fools men are!"
"Now, wait r. minute â "
But Mrs. Walnwrljrht began to croon: "Oh, If Marjory should hear of
this! Oil. if shr> should !:<;.;â  of it! Just let her hearâ "
"But i-ho must not," cried the professor, tlgerlshly. "Just you dare!"
And the woman saw before her a man whose eyes were lit with a ilame
Which almost expressed a temporary hatred.
The professor had left Coleman so abruptly that the correspondent
found himself murmuring hr.lf-coherent gratitude to the closed door of his
room. Amazement soon i r-jran to be mastered by exultation. He flung
himself upon the brandy and soda and negotiated a strong- glass. Pacing
thÂ« room with nervous steps, he caught a vision of himself in a tall mir-
ror,
yir.d he
halted
before It.
"Well," he
sain, "Ku-
fus, you're a
fraud man.
There is not
your equal any-
'whore. luu are a
great, bold, strong
player, fit to sit down to
H^ a game with the best."
a moment later it struck
him that be had appropriated
too much. If the prolessor haa
paid him a Visit and made a won-
derlul announcement, he, Coleman,
had i.ot been the engine of it. And then
he (â¢:;;..Â»â ,.. led clearly something in his
mind which even in a vague I orra had
been responsible far much or his early ela-
â  tlon. Marjory herself bad compassed this thing.
With shame he rejected a llrst wild and prepos
terous idea that she baa sent her father to him.
He reflected that a man who for an instant could con-
ceive sucn a thing was a natural-born idiot. Wnn an
equal feeling he rejected also an idea that -sue could have
known anything of her father's purpose. If she had known of
his purpose there would have been no visit. What, then, was
the cause? Coleman soon decided that the professor had wit
nessed some demonstration of Marjory's emotion which had teen
sufficiently severe m its character to torce him to the extraordinary visit.
But then this .also was wild and preposterous. That coldly beautiful god
dess would not have given a demonstration of emotion over Kutus Cole
man smticlent alarming to have forced her father on such an errand. That
was impossible. .No he was wrong; Marjory even Indirectly could not be
connected With the visit. As he arrived at. this decision the enthusiasm
passed out of him and he wore a doleful monkish face.
"Well, what, then, was the cause?" After eliminating Marjory from
the discussion aging in his mind he found it hard to hit upon anything
rational. '1 he only remaining theory was to the effect that the professor,
having a very high sense of the correspondent's help in the escape of tne
Wainwright party, had decided that the only way to express his gratitude
was to revoke a certain decision which he now could see had been unfaiy.
The retort to this theory seemed to be that if the professor had had sucn
a line conception of the services rendered by Coleman h had had ample
time to display his appreciation on the road to Axta and on the road down,
from Arta. There was no necessity for his waiting until their arrival In.
Athens. It was impossible to concede that the professor's emotion could be
a new one; If he had It now he must have had it in far stronger measure
directly after he had been hauled out of danger.
So it may be seen that after Coleman had eliminated Marjory from the
discussion that was waging in his mind he had practically succeeded In
eliminating the professor as well. This, he thought mournfully, was elim
inating with a vengeance. If he dissolved all the factors he could hardly
proceeed.
The mind of a lover moves In a circle, or at least on a more circular
course than other minds, Borne of which at times even) seem to move almost
in a straight line. Presently Coleman was at the point where he had
started and he did not pause until he reached that theory which asserted
that the professor had been inspired to his visit by some Bight or knowl
edge of Marjory in distress." Of course Coleman waa wistfully desirous of
proving to himself the truth of this theory.
The palpable agitation of the professor during thÂ© Interview seemed to
support it. If he had come on a mere journey of conscience he would have
hardly appeared as a white and trembling old man. But then, said Cole
man, he himself probably exaggerated this idea of the professor's appear
ance. . It might have be^en that he was only sour and distressed over thÂ©
performance of a very disagreeable duty.
The correspondent paced his room and smoked. Sometimes he halted
nt the little table where was the brandy and soda. He thought so hard
that sometimes it seemed that Marjory had been to him to propose mar
riage, and at other times it seemed that there had been.no visit from any
one at all.
A desire to talk to somebody was upon him. He strolled downstairs
and into the smoking and reading rooms, hoping to see a man he knew,
even if it were Coke. But the only occupants were two strangers furiously
debating the war. Passing the Minister's room Coleman saw that there
was a light within, and he could not forbear knocking. He was bidden to
enter, and opened the door upon the Minister, carefully reading his Spec
tator, fresh from London.
He looked up and seemed very glad. "How are you?" he cried. "I was
tremendously anxious to see you, do you know? I looked for you to dine
with me /o-night, but you were not down."
"No; I had a great deal of work."
"Over the Wainwright affair? By the way, I want you to accept my
personal thanks for that work.. In a week more I would have gone de
mented and spent the rest of my life in some kind of a cage, shaking the
bars and howling out State Department messages about the Wainwrights
You see, in my territory there are no missionaries to get into trouble and
I was living a life of undisturbed and innocent calm, ridiculing the senti
ments of men from Smyrna and other interesting towns who maintained
that the diplomatic service was exciting. However, when the Wainwright
party got lost my life at once became very active. I was all but helpless
too, which was the worst of it. I suppose Terry at Constantinople must
have got grandly stirred up also. Pity he can't see you to thank you for
saving him from probably going mad. By the way," he added while
looking keenly at Coleman, "the Wainwrights don't seem to be smothering
you with gratitude?" &
"Oh, as much as I deserveâ sometimes more," answered Coleman "My
exploit was more or less of a fake, you know. I was between the lines by
accident, or through the efforts of that blockhead of a dragoman I didn't
intend it. And then in the night, when we were waiting in the road be
cause of a fight, they almost bunked into us. That's all.
"They ten it better," said the Minister severely. "Especially the young
sters."
"Those kids got into a high old fight at a town up there beyond Agrln
ion. Tell you about that, did they?' I thought not. Clever kids. You havo
noted that there are signs of a few bruises and scratches?"
"Yes, but I didn't askâ"
"Well, they are from the fight. It seems the people took us for Ger
mans, and there was an awful palaver which ended In a proper and hand
some shindig. It raised the town, I tell you/V.-i-;-,

Coleman laughed, and they smoked for a time. That s a cnarmn Â«

Coleman answered calmly: "Well â¢ â¢ â¢ I think I'll take your ad
vice." '
CHAPTER XXIX. , ,
The next morning Coleman awoke with a sign of a resoulte decision on
his face as if it had been a development of his sleep. He would sco ->^^f
jory as soon, as possible; see her despite any barbed-wire entangiemeiius
which might be placed in the way uy her mother, whom he regarded as
his strenuous enemy. 'And be would ask Marjory's hand in the presence
of all Athens if it became necessary. __ . . .â 
He sat a long time at his breakfast in order to see the TN alnwrtg hta
enter the dining room, and as he was a.bout to surrender to the win ot
time they came in, the professor placid and self-satisfied, Mrs. v ainwrignt
worried and injured and Marjory cool, beautiful, serene. If there had oeen
any kind of a storm there was no trace of it in the white brow or tne gir*.
Coleman studied her closely but furtively while his mind spun arounu n.B
circle of speculation. '
Finally he noted the waiter -who was observing him with a paineti aar
as if it was on the tip of his tongue to ask this guest if he was going Â«>
remain at breakfast forever. Coleman passed out to the reading J^ 111 '
where upon the table a multitude of great red guide books were c-rusniny
the fragile magazines of London and Paris. On the wails were various de
pressing maps with the name of a tourist agency luridly upon them, ana
there were also some pictures of hotels with their ratesâ in. francsâ yruuea
beneath. The room Vas cold, dark, empty, With the trail of the to-unai
upon it. , . ti . ____
Coleman went to tho picture of a hotel in Corfu and stared at it pre
cisely as if he was interested. He was standing before it when he neara
Marjory's voice just without the door. "All right! I'll wait." He did not
move for the reason that the hunter moves not when the unsuspecting
deer approaches his hiding place. She entered rather quickly and was well
toward the center of the room before she perceived Coleman. ' Oh! snÂ»
said and stopped. Then she spoke the immortal sentence, ;l sentence wmen,
curiously enough, is common to the drama, to the novel and to life. I
thought no one was here." She looked as if she was going to retreat, but
it would have been hard to make such retreat graceful, and prooabiy lor
this reason she stood her ground.
Coleman Immediately moved to a point between her avid th^ o.oot.
"You are not going to run away from me, Marjory "Wainwright. he cried
angrily. "You at least owe it to me to tell me definitely that you don t lovÂ»
me â that you can't iove meâ" -
She did not fare him with all of her old spirit, but she faced him. ana
In her answer there was the old Marjory. "A most common question. Da
you ask all your feminine acquaintances that?"
'â¢I meanâ" he said, "I mean that I lov^ you andâ"
"Yesterdayâ no To-dayâ yes. To-morrow â who knowa. Really^ yon
ought to take" some steps to know your own mind."
"Know my own mind," he retorted in a burst of indignation. Tfou
mean you ought to lake steps to know your own mind."
"My own mind! You â " Then she halted in acute confusion and all neÂ»
face went pink She had been, far quicker than the man. to define the
scene. She lowered her head. "Let me pass pleaseâ "
But Cok-man sturdily blocked the way and even took onÂ© of her strug
gling bands "Marjory l -" And then his brain must have roared with a
thousand quick sentences, for they came tumbling out, one over the other.
â¢ â¢ Her resistance to the grip of his lingers grew somewhat feeble, OneÂ«
she raised her eyes in a quick glance at him â¢ â¢ Then suddenly Â»hÂ»
wilted. She surrendered, she confessd without words. "Oh, Marjory, thank
God, thank God â " .. â¢ _ .
Peter Tounley made a dramatic entrance on the gallop. He stopped,
petrified. "Whoa!" he cried. "My stars!" He turned and fled. But Cole
man called after him in a low voice, intense with agitation. 'Come back
here, you young scoundrel! Come back here!'' " â  â 
Peter returned, looking very sheepish. I hadn t the. slightest Idea
''Never mind that now. But look here, Jf you tell a jingle soulâpar
ticularly those other young scoundrelsâ l'll breakâ"
"1 won't Coleman. Honest, I won't." He was far more embarrassed
than Coleman and almost equally so with Marjory. He was like a horsÂ«
tugging at a tether. "I won't, Coleman! Honest!"
"Well, all right, then." Peter escaped.
The professor and his wife were In their sitting room writing letters.
The cablegrams had all been answered, but as the professor Intended to
prolong his journey homeward into a month of Paris and London there re
mained the arduous duty- of telling their friends at length exactly what
had happened There was considerable of the lore of old^n Greece In the
'professor's descriptions of their escape, and in tho3O of Mrs. Wainwxight
there was much about the lack of hairpins and soap.
Their heads were lowered over their writing when the door Into the
corridor opened and shut quickly, and upon looking up they saw In the
room a radiant girl, a new Marjory. She dropped to her knees by her
father's chair and reached her arms to his neck. "Oh, daddyl I'm happyl
I'm to happy!" .
"Whyâ whatâ " began the professor stupidly.
"Oh I'm to happy, daddy!'
Of course he could not be long In making- his conclusion. The onÂ« who
could give such joy to Marjory was the one who last night gave her such
grief. The professor was only a moment In undemanding. He laid hi a
hand tenderly upon her head. "Bless my soul," ,he murmured. "And â
and â he â "
At the personal pronoun Mrs. Wainwright lumbered frantically to her
feet. "What?" she shouted. "Coleman?"
"Yes," answered Marjory. "Coleman.", As she spoke the name her
eyes were shot with soft yet tropic flashes of light.
Mrs. Wainwright dropped suddenly back into her chair. ""Wellâ ofâ
things!"
The professor was stroking his daughter's hair, and although for a
time after Mrs. Waimvright's outbreak there was little said, the old man,
and the girl seemed In gentle communion, she making him feel her happi
ness, he making her feel his appreciation. Providentially Mrs. Wainwrfght
had boon so .stunned by the lirst blow that she was evidently rendered in
capable of speech. Â» "â  .â  T
"And are you sure you will be happy with him?" asked her father
gently.
"All my lift; long," she answered. ->. -
"I am glad! I am glad!" said the father, but even as he tpoke a gTeat
sadness came to blend with his joy. The hour when he was to give this
beautiful and beloved life into the keeping of another had been heralded
by the god of the sexes, the ruthless god that devotes Itself to the tearing:
of children from the parental arms and casting thorn amid the mysteries
Cf an irretrievable wedlock. The thought filled him with solemnity.
But in the dewy eyes of the girl there was no Question. The world to
her was a land of glowing promise. :.,;: , ;; . i; -Â _- . . â .::..
"I am glad," repeated the professor.
The girl arose from her knees. "I must go away andâ think all about
It," she said, smiling. When the door of her room closed upon her the
mother arose in majesty.
"Harrison W.ilnv.right," Ehe declaimed, you are not going to- allow
this monstrous thin;?!"
The professor was aroused from a reverie by these words. â¢ "What
monstrous thing?" he growled. â¢ â  â  /â¢
"Why. this between Coleman and Marjory."
"Yes, he answered boldly. '". ~
"Harrison ! That man who â " â¢,' â¢; . . â¢ :
The professor crashed his hand down on thÂ» table. **Maryl I â will not
hear another word of it!"
"Well," said Mrs. Walnwright, sullen and ominous, "time win telll
Time will tell!" Â,...â.
When Coleman had turned from the fleeing: Peter Tounley again to
Marjory he found her making the preliminary movement* of a flljrht.
"What's the matter?" he demanded, anxiously.
"Oh. it's too â¢dreadful!"
"Nonsense," he retorted stoutly. "Only Peter Tounleyt He fion't
count. What of that?"
Oh, dear!" She pressed her palm to a burning cheek. She save him a
starlike. beseeching glance. "Let me go nowâ please."
"Well," he answered, somewhat affromed, "If you likeâ"
At the door she turned to look at him, ami this glance expressed In ItÂ»
elusive way a score of things which she had not yet been able to speak.
It explained that she was loth to leave him, that she asked forgiveness for
leaving him. that even for a short absence she wished to take his image
in her eyes, that he must not bully her, that there w r as something now In
her heart which frightened her, that Bhe loved him, that she was happyâ
When she had gone Coleman wrnt to the rooms of the American Minis
ter. A Greek was there who talked wildly as he waved his cigarette.
Coleman waited in well-concealed Impatience for the evaporation of this
man. Once the Minister, regarding the correspondent hurriedly, inter
polated a comment. "You look very cheerful?"
"Yes," answered CoU?man; "I've been taking your advice."
"Oh, ho!" said the Minister.
The Greek with the cigarette Jawed endlessly. Coleman began to mar
vel at the enduring good manners of the Minister, who continued to nod
and nod in polite appreciation of the Greek's harangue, which. Coleman
firmly believed, had no point of interest whatever. But at last' the man
after ah effusive farewell, went his way. '
"Now." said the Minister, wheeling in his chatr, "tell me all about tt.**
Coleman arose, and thrusting his hands deep In his trousers pocket's
began to pace the room with long strides. He said nothing, but kept hit
eyes on the floor.
"Can I have a drink?" he asked, abruptly pausing.
"What would you like?" asked the Minister, benevolently, as he touched
the bell.
"A brnndy and soda. I'd like It very much. You see," he said as he
resumed his walk, "I have no kind of right to burden you with my affairs!
but 10 tell the truth if I don't get this news off my mind and Into some
body's ear I'll die. It's thisâ l asked Marjory Wainwright to marry me
andâ she accepted, andâ that's all." '
"Well, I am very glad," cried the Minister, arising and giving hlÂ»
hand. "And as for burdening me with your affairs, no one has a better
right, you know, since you released me from the persecution of Waahlnjfw
ton and the friends of the Walnwrlghts. May good luck follow you both
forever. You, in my opinion, are a very, very fortunate man. And for her
partâ she has not done too badly."
Seeing that It was Important that Coleman should have his Bolrtts
pacified in part the Minister continued! "Now, I have got to write an
official letter, bo you Just walk up and down hero and use up this surDlu*
Bteam. Else you'll explode."
But Coleman was not to be detained. Now that ho had Informed the
Minister he must rush off somewhere, anywhere, and do â he knew not
â what.
"All right." said the Minister, laughing. Tou have a wilder head than
I thought. But look here," he called, as Coleman was making for th*
door. "Am I to keep this news a secret?" "*â¢
Coleman, with his hand on the knob, turned Impressively, hÂ© bdoltÂ«
With deliberation. "As far as lam concerned I would be glad to sea aCÂ»
paint it in red letters eight feet high on the front of the Klnrs palace."
The Minister, left alone, wrote steadily and did not even look uo Â«*Â«,
Peter Tounley and two others entered In response to hiÃ cry of permlsalnn
However, he presently found time to speak over hiÂ» shoulder to thilm*

there was no crow or cackle. One young man blushed scarlet and in nk Â«*

nN"E w-ornan driven almost to desperm
j tlon by odors of cooking in her
N^_ ;i/ I housekeeping rooms invented this
window kitchen. She had struggled
along-, taking all sorts of care to get rid
of the cooking that would linger, and that
perfect cyclones of fresh air would not
blow away, and finally was forced to ad
ir.i: that light housekeeping left heavy
odcrs. That they could net be get rid of
as lons as cooking was done in the room
she had discovered; but what to do and
how to do itâ how not to cock In the only
room she had, where she had to eat and
live, made her thinking apparatus go at
a two-forty gait:
'â¢Necessity Is the mother of Invention,"
and the window kitchen Is what shÂ«
thought out. had made, and proved It to
be a. success. The simplest thins tmagia
abl'?, and yet the odors that had staid and
made so painfully evident the fact that
pots and pans and dinner dishes were all
carefully hidden out of sight were done
away wtthJ A clever plan, you will 3oca
see.
Outside of the lower sash cf the win
dow she had built a miniature bex-shaped
kitchen. The roof was slanting: and tha
bos securely fastened to each side of thÂ«
window. Inside were two compartments,
the lower cne for the gas stove and tha
upper one for cooking utensils. In each.
compartment eight or ten holes wÂ»rÂ»
bored to admit air and carry out the
steam and odors. In the window sash a
hole large enough for the gaspipe or tub*
was cut, so that the window could ba
closed or raised at will.
In front of the window inside of tha
room a long chest was built. The chest
had shelves and doors, and in it were kept
the cooking utensils.
When the m*al was over the dishes
washed and put away, the chest is trans
formed Into a coach by upholstering and
pillows, the curtains are drawn together
in front of the window and the room,
cdorless and spic-span. is ready to receive
visitors. The ventilation cf the room is in
no way interfered with, as both upper and
tower windows m^ve up and down with
out "hindrance. This little kitchen- doea
for one cr two, but would cot be practical
for more. _

"FOUND IN THE PWWPP^NES"
A New Novel by GENERAL CHARLES KING,
After his rsturn from a year's hard service, broken down in health. General King became a novelist
again, and has written a romance cf American army life as he himself had just been experiencing it un-
der the entirely new conditions of warfare in a far-off land. The opportunity cf being the only practiced
novelist of army life in the fighting seems to have been a special inspiration to him. for a stronger, more
interesting novel than this one he has never written. THE STOSY OPEXS AT SAN FRASTCT3CO, amid
ail the confusion, bustie and excitement of assembling large bodies of troops and great bulks of stores
preparatory to embarkment. It moves at a pace accordant with the stirring times; telling incidents follow
each other in swift succession, and there is an involvement and complication of people and circumstances
as dramatic and absorbing as war itself. It is thus one of those stories that leave the reader in the
greatest impatience for the next installment. It is safe to say that it iÂ»â and will always remainâ THE
novel of the Philippine war.

jtanging Pictures.
"To hang and properly group pictures
Is not an easy matter," writes Maria. Par
loa in the September Ladies' Home
Journal. "To succeed one must have a
good eye for distances, tot straight lines.
and for harmony in grouping, as well a3
a fund of parience â putting up and taking;
down Â»Â»a<:h picture, or set of pictures, until
the position, height and grouping are per
fectly satisfactory
"There are two kinds of picture wireâ
one Is gilt, the other la silvered. Tho gilt
is more flexible, and remains untarnished
and flexible longer than the silvered, but
it Is also more expensive. Extremely
heavy pictures should be hung with cop
per wire.
"The picture hcoks should be broad and
well curved, that they may hold firmly
to the molding- and be a secure support
for the wire. A yardstick or tape-meas
ure is Indispensable, as careful measuring
-will lessen the labor and assure accuracy
of position
"A picture should be so hung that the
bottom shall lie Bat and the top be
thrown forward slightly. The manner in
which the screw-eyes are put In produces
this effect. For a small picture they
should be fastened two or three inches
from the top of the frame; the larger the
picture the greater should be the distance
of the screw-eyes from the top.
"If the room be high it is easy to make
It appear lower by fastening the picture
molding two or more feet below the
celling. Thfs can be done only when the

Relishes.

luncheon table and should be served a3
daintily as possible. They must be varied

ffev COay to Make Coffee.
The latest word of those who know is
that to be perfect coffee must never, while
it is making, come In contact with any
metal. For the breakfast table, at least,
it should be made in glass.
First buy from a depot of medical sup
plies a flask of annealed glass which looks
like an ordinary water bottle. The price
is 30 centsâ no great outlay considering
the bottle will stand boiling water with
cut breaking. Then pay 5 cents for a
glass funnel to fit Into the bottle neck,
and 10 cents for a dozen round bits of
clean, coarse white muslin.
Coffee itself la tUe next thing. It is real
Java, bought green of a dealer who has
regard to his word, at 50 cent 3 to 60 cents
the pounds It is roasted to a nicety at
home, half pound at a time, and ground
just as it is anted. It may go into I
chased silver lidded bowl without the least
harm. The water may likewise boil in a
silver kettle, over a brass-mounted spirit
lamp â or even on the plebeian gas stove â
before It cornea in sight. The one essen
tial thing is to have it in plenty and
freshly boiling. , . â, â , â.
First pour a cup of boiling water In the
flask and turn it deftly about, heating the
fiaÂ«k all the way up. Then, pour it out.
whip the funnel in the flask mouth, line
the funnel with on* of the muslin rounds
and put into it three heaping tables]
fuls of the ground coffee. Then slowly,
steadily, gracefully, pour on the waterâ
which has been kept bubbling over the
spirit lamp. As It begins to drip through
stir the wet coffee lightly with a teaspoon.
More water goes in as the first pouring
filters through. Three spoonfuls of try
coffee ought to yield three cups of the
coffee essence.
It is really coffee essence which comes
out of the flask. It Is almost black, per
fectly clear, full of coffee flavor and
aroma. Only the most confirmed coffee
toper can drink It neat. Other folk re
quire the cup to be half filled with boiling
water. Those who like whipped cream in
it make the water a third. Thus a single
filtering will serve a considerable tea
party. ThÂ« muslin and the spent grounds
are thrown awa.y after each filtering.

NEXT to bedrooms, kitchens are I -Â»
most abused room 3 In a house.
J^ People seem to think that any old
sort of a room will do and any old
thing good enough to be pat In it.
To my mind a kitchen should be tha
room of a house. Much attention should.
be paid to every little detail, and above
all to light and ventilation. Everything
should be built and placed so as to save
steps. The kitchen walls should be
painted white and be washable, the floor
linoleum or hard wood and with, a drain.
so arranged that it may be flushed Â»fter
It has been scrubbed.
The range should be placed at ore side of
the room where plenty of light can be had
and where an iron ventilator will be over
It to carry out the steam. The sink;
should be placed to the right of tha
range and be of galvanized iron and have
open plumbing; the grooved drainboard
for the dishes will be to the left and to
the right a plain board to hold the un
washed dishes. At the back of the sink
hooks should be placed to hold the cups,
spoons and 3ieves. which are constantly.
In use. The table should stand in tha
middle of the room, have four drawers,
and be solid and stationary. Chopping
knives and a chopping board should hangr
at one side. Suspended over the table a
rack to hold the saucepans, broiler, fry
ing par.3 and strainers. Shelves should
be built near the stove and over the atni
to hold porcelain bowls. baJtmjr disnes
and the articles used for seasoning.
A small rack for the kitchen towels,
dlshtoweis and stove pads should be near
the stove, the roller towel rack hanging
rear the sink.
The refrigerator should be on the porch
In a cool place or built in the wall of the
kitchen and have a sliding door. In an
ideal kitchen vegetables are never kept
In one compartment In the iceb ox; a bin

Fortunately for most or us, ncnes arÂ»
not needed to mast this accomplish
ment, but it is a -wise woman, a very
wise woman, who knows how to mak*
the very best of everything which comes
her way.
The woman who "makes the beat cf
things" ha 3 a home In every sense of the
word. Her house is furnished in such a,
way that no great amount of work La
necessary to keep it in perfect order. The
burden of many a housekeeper will be
lightened as soon as she realizes the beau
ty of simplicity in rooms which are in
constant use. Heavy draperies and up-,
bolstered furniture will keep one pair or
bands busy freeing them from dust.
As a rule there ia but one maid in the-;
house of this woman who knows how to*
live well- but she has been taught tha;/
to always appear in one's best ia an ac-*i
complishment, and consequently dons a,
sunny apron before leaving the kitchen;,
to answer a ring ai the door. She does;
not work all the time, her mistress ha*

necessary for tnat domain. Pot 3 an<i.

â¢or a cup of tea to be made in a hurry
and nobody can get tired or cross by
having to wait.
It i 3 a delight to be a guest in such a
home. You will find each little detaiL
complete. Tour choice of a smooth or
rough towei, castile soap or a scented
bar, a nice, big wash cloth in the bath
room or a small one, and. best of ail, aÂ«
tooth brush to take the place of the one*
you left at home. Pins of all sizes and
sorts you wiil find on your dressing table:
all the little details so carefully looked,
after that the mistress of the house is
not disturbed at your coming, or you so
uncomfortable that you long to be homeÂ»
So- many women neglect these little de
tails in housekeeping and for an excua*
claim that these little comforts are ex
pensive; it is not so, they cost a mere
nothing. It !s simply the lack of
thought and not of money that is re
sponsible for so many upset, shiftless
households.
The woman who knows how to- lire well
makes everything count. She sees pos
sibilities in everything, and best of all
can carry the i-eas out. Even an old
lace curtain, with ragged, sorrowful look
ing edges, has possibilities in her eyes.
It is not relegated to the attic or given.
to the ash man. ah no. The worn edges
are trimmed off, it is cut down to tit a
smaller window or perhaps made into a
dainty table cover. Her income is not
half as Large as a friend's, and yet she
has gathered about her all those little
conveniences that add so much to the
comfort and pleasure cf home life.
She isn't snobbish. Never. Snobbish
ness cuts off here and there to make
one big showing; stint 3 where money
should be expended just to outdo some
one else In the neighborhood. It is never
snobbery to do the best it all times, to
make the most of one's circumstances
every day one lives.
The woman who knows how to live well
is so thoroughly mistress of her home
and all its little details that she never
worries other members of her family with,
the litle ups and downs. She has tact,
tact in great bucketfuis; she avoids tha
discussion of domestic affairs at the
table. Negligent servants or a burned
steak are not pleasant topics for din
ner, and what man wants to come from
a busy office to be burdened and bored
with horrid little household troubles.
The women who understand the art of
living well are far and few between. If
you realize you are not among her num
ber, go and learn of her who is. Life' 3
so short, and most of its misery, we. our
selves, are to be blamed for. To be
happy la to make others happy. But

polished top of the- dressing case is often
marred by the spilling of perfumes or .
other liquids. In order to- prevent this
make an enamel cloth to fit the top and
spread it under the fancy cover.
STAINSâ One reason why fruit stain*
and other stains b*?come set in. a. fabric i 3
because soap is usert on them. Always
take out the stain before the article of
clothing has been washed and. if possible,

remove any fruit stain. Oxalic acid or*
chloride or lime will remove the most ;

on white goods, as they remove the color-'
from other materials. When chemicals
are used rinse ir. four or five waters.
REFRIGERATORSâ Are very hard
things to keep clean and about tha best
thing to use is common sand soap. The
lining of the refrirerator is usually zir.r.
and zir.c is attacked by acids and alkalies
if they are Ptrcng, so sand soap is the
beat and safest cleanser. In buying ice
for the refrigerator It la cheaper to get

ice is wasted if the door of the ice cham

A CALIFORNIA GIRL VISITS SARAH BERNHARDT AT HER HOME.
Interesting Bits of Home

ARAH BERNHARDT, the triple
V^X genius, actress, pointer and

N-"^ ed about and written about in al
most every language and in the

Luxurious. I have said, yet the word is
woefully weak for the home of Sarah
Bernhardt. It may fittingly be used to
describe the palace of a king or the col
lected comforts of a Croesus, but alone
it givss no idea of the indefinable "at

apartments.

17 T Is pome time since the publication of
Mr. Hai ling's 1 1
[I Rod's "La Silence" ("The
Sileice"), yet even now a few words
about this remarkable book may be of in
terest.
"Kermoysan," the first of the two
stories of silence which the book contains,
springs up spontaneously from one of
those exquisitely natural conversations
with whjch French novelists sometimes
Introduce their works. One of the speak
ers affirms the paradoxical and dangerous
belief that there are cases when "thanks
to the aberrations of the social organiza
tion and to social prejudices, lying, deceit
and hypocrisy almost become virtues;
â¢when the concealment from the world of
a love which cannot be avowed is a. hero-
Ism." He adds: "When this love goes
through one of those crises In which the
heart is breaking, in which cries rise to
the lips and choking aoh:-i to the throat,
yet all must bo suppressed -think what
In such a moment the ma of Cerence
costs, think of the tortures It hides, Tell
me if then the hypocrisy Of silence, the
lie of the quiet, calm voice, the dissimu
lation of living the life that others live
does not constitute a sacrifice, too, the
most painful that we can exact of a man,
and consequently the most noble."
This is the underlying thought In "Ker
moysan." Andre Kermoysan and Mine,
Herdevin are a man and a woman whom
the author represents himself as meeting
wfcen he first goes into society. Each is
c person of singular distinction and at
tractiveness, and to each the young man
Is drawn. Led by iis Interest In them to
observe them attentively, he thinks he
perceives that some subtle bidden bond
connects the two. They seem never to
meet except casually, there is no sign
of love that the world can see, yet the
eyes of the young man who tells the story,
opened by affectionate Interest, come by
little and little to see in details barely
noticeableâ a glance, a movementâ praofa
that force on him and on the reader the
conviction that these two proud and dell
cate- souls axe concealing from all the
â¢world with incredible self-command a
passional* love which consumes their
vrhoie being. Mme. Herdevm is a wile,
the wife indeed of a vulgar libertine, but
a wife; she is the mother of children
â¢whom bho adores; above all, sue is a
woman, with a woman's instinctive re
serve. To protect her from the anguish of
scandal, from the desecration by public
ity of the inner sanctuary of her life, she
and hen lover sacrifice their peace to hide
tho culpable love which is the one joy of
their lives. To the last, beyond the
tomb, Kermoysan kept her secret, and
â¢when ho stood beside her coffin only the
deepalr ii! his eyes spoke his desolation.
The subtlety with which the author
conveys the vague yet inevitable certain
ty of the strange relation is in singular ac
cordance with the conception which cre
ates the novel. No less remarkable is the
character of refinement and dignity given
to Kermoysan by Indirect suggestions
even less palpable than the circumstan
tial evidence of his love for Mme. Herde
vin.
The 6ocond tale, a less powerful
ore and one of a lower and
less delicate type, Is on a sim
ilar theme. Two lovers, bound togeth
er not only by their passion, guilty in lt
eelf. but by the fact that the man has
the husband's blood on his hands, flee
together to live in isolation from the
â¢world. The woman's beauty. is destroyed
by an accident. The lover, against all
the struggles of his will, loses bis love
but not his tenderness, his pity, his affec
tion, his devotion. "He lives a lie to her,
with bia words, his looks, his kisses,*'
diles. The wall of this savage alcove is
also covered with curious skins and the
- of grinning hyenas, while above
the couch two dragons support a bro
caded canopy, by means of which the
iight may be regulated.
Here it is that Mme. Bernhardt iloes
. and takes her ilaily
siesta preparatory to the evening
ertion. A large golden cage filled with
brightly colored birds faces the \v< nder
ful couch. Formerly it was occupied t>y
two baby tigers, bul they became too

Appleton & Co. have published two little
popular manuals of Information, one on
the army and one on the navy. The books
are written primarily for young i pie,
but will l>e of interest to ninny older ones.
In each the most impressive fact is the
evolution of the gunâ 'â '-â â¢â  ch-'oading
rifled musket and the breach-loading
rifled cannon.
A man need not be very aged to re
member tie flintlock. To load, a soldier
took up 'iis powder-horn, drew the- stop
per with his teeth, measured his powder,
poured It Into the gun, replaced the
Stopper and the horn, tore oft a piece of
cloth for a wad, if necessary greased It,
drew a soft round bullet from the pouch
and put It in the wad, rammed the bullet
to place, took up the gun, picked the
vent If It was foul, opened a little pan on
top of the gun near the breech, poured
powder In and closed the nan, and if
need be sharpened his flint, ills gun was
good for 150 or 200 yards, and it was only
after long improvements that it could be
fired once a minute. Now a soldier claps
live cartridges Into his rifle, and every
minute can send twenty-five or thirty
long, hard projectiles, carrying death a
mile or more. What would happen to an
army In these days which should wait for
a sight of the whites of the enemies'
eyes.' or even of their brass buttons? or
which should advance with a solid front?
Mr. Austin's little book gives a vivid
picture of the modern . tacticsâ of the
troops scattered, crouching, crawling
from cover to cover, or dashing a few
yards on. He explains clearly how the
soldier, thus left to himself, must be more
intelligent and independent, even more
genuinely courageous in some ways than
of old.
The history of the navy has the same
central facts to presentâ development
of the modern gun and its effects on
tactics. Ships no longer can close with
their antagonists muzzle to muzzle and
send cannon-balls crashing into each
other's sides until victor and vanquished
both drift from the fight. Nelson once
lay alongside a beaten vessel and led
his men across her deck to an enemy be
yond. . Contrast this with Santiago, where
the two fleets, were not within a mile of
each other.

authors have meant to write only of the
changes in the art of war on sea or land

The Rev. C. R. Brown, pastor of the
First Congregational Church, Oakland,
has recently published a book entitled
"The Main Points," i. Â .. of the. Christian,
religion. The book which is a very short
one, is a revision of ten addresses on such
themes as: "The Divinity of .Jesus
Christ," "The Atonement," "The Philoso
phy of Prayer," "The Hope of immortal
ity," "The Last Judgment." Dr. Brown's*
purpose is to give to some of the cardinal
beliefs of Christianity a statement con
sonant with modern habits of thought.
He disclaims any pretense to originality
of substance and puts his book forwara
simply as a brief popular exposition, nd
dressed to busy people, of the ideas con
tained in some of the profounder theo
logical works of the time. â¢ -
In the history of the Christian church
two tendencies are constantly at work,
one Baying: "This is just; it must be God's
will," the other, "This is God's will; it
must be just." One is the voice of con
ildence in the reasonableness of God's
world, the other the expression of the
sense of Its mystery. , One looks toward
science, the other toward revelation.
It is in this second spirit that the tra
ditional theology of evangelical Protest
antism was built up. Accepting certain
dogmas as divinely taught this theology
rigidly deduced their logical conclusions.
The result was a philosophy of life the.
simplicity and logical consistency of
which have given it a power which fas
cinates and controls the mind. Cold,
calm, logical, attacked as mechanical,
cruel and even devilish, this theology
stands as the opposite of Dr. Brown n.
Where the Calvlnist elaborates a system
Dr. Brown refuses to take a step beyond
the plain words of Scripture, Where a
doctrine Is taught he interprets it in its
happiest form. Nowhere does Dr. Brown
seem to depart from orthodoxy as it is
conceived of In evangelical churches. He
believes In the divinity of Christ, in an
atonement by him, in the propriety of
praying for some temporal goods. In Ir
remediable moral degradation, and hence
In an everlasting state of lostnesa for
some sinners. But his doctrine 1* at low

For religious minds who feel the oppres

comfort, its honesty and courage, its
frankness and sympathy, must command
respect from all, whether they need its
message or not.
The book is wisely addressed not to
logic, but to a prevailing sentiment or
way of thinking. Logic has but little to
say on such questions. It is fortunate for
the world that, there are clergy who
preach in such Â« temper. By their agency
the Inevitable advance of science and
speculative philosophy may be assimilated
into the traditional belief, profoundly
modifying it, but in no sense destroying
or diminishing the religious feeling ex
pressed through it.

A second edition of Captain Mahan's
"Life of Nelson" has just been published.
The author has amplified his treatment
of some disputed points and added some
curious information, but he has left the
second edition substantially the same as
the first. It would be impertinent' to write
at length of this already celebrated book.
The reader does not know at which to
feel the greatest surprise*; the literary
faculty of so accomplished a naval tac
tician, or the technical thoroughness with
which so sympathetic and skillful a writer
treats naval questions. Nelson's career
had the unity and intensity of a great
drama; but the treatment of the great
mass of records In which Milton's life lay
buried in such a manner as to reveal this
unity and intensity required literary art
of no mean order. The American navy,
distinguished alike for scientific attain
ments in peace and for valor and skill In
war, has received new honor from Cap
tain Mahan's books. The "Life of Nel
son" is one of several Important biograph
ical works to be published this fall in new
and cheaper editionsâ Mrs. Browning's
"Letters" and McCarthy's "Gladstone,"
for instance. The first edition of the
"Life of Nelson" cost $8. the second costs
$3 and is a fine piece of bookmaking.

have had their attention fixed upon what
the Dreyfus case meant for France, it
is well to be reminded that the cause of
human freedom has found its embodiment
in thÂ» j person of a Jew. This is not by

B. C. The history of this cameo i? known from the year lnoO
A. D., but there is a difference of opinion as to its origin.
Some scholars believe It to be a product of the Renaissance,
others that it is Grecian. Mr. Robinson believes it to be a
product of Greece, and the trend of opinion seems to be In that
direction.
The first figure to the left bears aloft a dish containing
probably what in a wedding gift, or food for the nuptial feast.
Next on the left nre Cupid and Psyche, the central figures, the
faces of both veiled from curious eyes, as custom prescribed.
Cupid bears a dove. The next tiny figure bears a torch over
nne shoulder and leads the couple by a cord. Still another
winged little fellow, with an open-handed posture, welcomes
them to what may be either a couch or a table for the feast.
The muscles of the body are depicted skillfully.
The hear 1 ? of Li via and Tiberius are carved in green tiir
quoise on another cameo. Unfortunately, only the upper part
of the .aem was found; what remains had to be patched to
gether, but the work was done so skillfully that it is scarcely
noticeable. The Ivad of Tiberius and the head and breast of
I>ivia remain intact. A small portion of the woman's drapery

THE American millionaire in London who gave th* moat
notable entertainment of the seanon has surpassed all
records for lavishness in offering: artist? for the pleasure
of his guests. King Ludwlg of Bavaria', who had an
opera sung for his Bolitary amusement, seems economical in
comparison With this latest list, and an nll-st;ir performance
at the Metropolitan could be undertaken at no greater cost.
Piidorewski, Sarah Bernnardt, Melba and Plancon, not to mpn
tion Ancona and Ronnard, were the artists engaged at this
entertainment. The musicians performed in a drawing room,
and for the actress, who appeared with s^me members of her
company in a little play, a Stage had been arranged. More than
$5000 was paid to these entertainers. Only the foreign actors
ar* engage.! for those drawing room appearances, and it is
curious to read tiv.t one of the best known women on the Paris
stage has juft gone to London with no idea of acting in a thea
ter, but with a list of engagements for private houses long
enough to keep hei employed tor three weeks. The difT.
in the value set on such forms of entertaining here is shown by
the compensation paid to n h'v nch actress of real fame who
acted here in private three years arro. She was the last to act
under these circumstances In New York, and gave a little play
in a Madison avenue drawing room after her regular per
formance. Only 1500 u-hÂ« paid t<> her for that. The pxplanation
used to he that the comparative smaliness of New York draw

that no longer holds, since so many among the persons- who
