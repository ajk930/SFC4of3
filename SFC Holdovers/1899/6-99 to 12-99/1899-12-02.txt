The train had Just left liranehvllta
when Messengers Ramsey and Rhodes

messenger was made to stand with his

compelled to hand over the money pack

Â«-<'iigers not to put a foot outride of the
car until the train had cÂ»t under way
jipaln. the robber pulled the bell and
jumited off a.* the train slowed up. The
conductor saw the roblÂ»ei escaping
â¢â¢ilotur.vjde the track, but. thinking him a

Whf-n the train Rot under way the mes

The car was a combination baggage

opened t<Â» permit the conductor to reach
the bacffaue Fectlon. which won in the
forward cad at j&o cor.
The san Francisco Call

and crew were taken aboard the
lifeboat by means of a slincr.
From the lifeboat they were
transferred to the tug and
iught to this city.
Rom members of the crew of
the W'eeott it was learned that at
about 5:30 o'clock the captain
headed his vessel toward the en
trance to the harbor. The bar
heavy, but all went well until
a point near the outer end of the
th jetty was readied, when a
giant sea swept over the steamer,
I ing her from <tern to >iem.
Water poured down the compan
ionway and flooded the engine
and fire rooms. The tires were
quenched and the vessel, her up
per w.rks wrecked, drifted help
. le>sly i n the heavy sea. A few
minutes later she struck the
r- >cks ..f the jetty and each suc

With life preservers strapped
about their bodies, the thirty hu
man beings aboard awaited the
arrival of the life-Saving crew. It
than an hour after the
steamer struck when the last Mir

I wo fatalities occurred during
the work of the rescue. Mrs. Car- i

SAN FRANCISCO, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 2, 1899.
Several of the crew suffered se
vere injuries. (, aptain Burtis was
; badly bruised while rendering as
sistance to the passengers. His
, injuries are not believe. l to be se
rious. Fireman Patrick Quirai of
Eureka suffered fractures of both
and some*of the passengers
were more or less injured, but
none seriously.
Al MoCann. a well-known Eu
rekan, who was purser of the
Steamer, was instrumental in sav
ing the lives of many persons
aboard. He describes the work
of the captain and other officers
â¢tremely heroic.
Captain Burtis was the last
man to leave the ship, and before
leaving he superintended the
placing of those who had become
his charges in the sling and see
m- them start safely for the life
boat. The first mate and chief
engineer stood nobly by their
captain, and but for their cour
age and coolness the list of fatali
ties would have been much
greater.
Scarcely had the work of res
cue been completed when the
steamer swung partly around on
the rocks and commenced going
to pieces. It is expected she will
entirely break up during the
night.
The Weeott was owned by C.
A. Doe & Co., and was com
manded by Captain S. H. Burtis.
She carried besides her regular
crew of twenty officers and men
the following passengers: Mrs.
Cannkhael, D. R. Carmichaei,

NEXT BIG BATTLE TO
BE AT TUGELA RIVER

THE RED CROSS IN SOUTH AFR.CA.
LONDON, Dec. 2. â The
week which lias l>een
marked by the brilliant ad
vance of LÂ«Â»r<l Methuen's column
closes in profound and remark
able silence. ( hrders seem to
have gone forth from military
headquarters in South Africa t<>
maintain silence. As there is n<>
great delay in telegraphing, de
spite the breakdown of one ca
ble, nothing else will explain the
absence of news. There is almost
no new information this morning
from any <>f the British i-<mi
mands in South Africa. The in
ference to be drawn is that the
generals are maturing plans,
which it would be improper at
this moment to disclose.
. It is not known yet how the
nattle of Modder River was
fought; whether Kimberley has
been relieved; whether General
Hildyard has moved forward
from Frere since last Tuesday, or
whether ( ieneral Gatacre has got
any closer to Stromberg Junc
tion.
The latest dispatch from Frere
states that on Tuesday the Brit
ish drove back the Boers, who
were trying to destroy a big
bridge near Colenso. If this was
the great structure over the Tu
gcla River, the fact of its being
intact is of great importance to
General C'lcry's advance. It is
uncertain which bridge the dis
patch refers to. There arc two,
a railway and a road bridge to
Ladysmith, crossing the Tugcla
at this point. The railway bridge
has already been reported to have
been destroyed. It is quite likely
that this report was false.
To make this bridge, which
ever it is. absolutely secure, a
British force must cross the river
and entrench itself on the further
bank at the bridge. It is not
stated whether General Hildyard
is able to do this. Undoubtedly
ii the advance troops have
crossed the river and entrenched
very importani success has been
gained, ;mrl a great obstacle in
Clery's way has been removed. It
is possible that the bridge has
been mined and may yet be de
stroyed.
There is every probability now
that the Boers will dispute the
passage of the Tugela River by
the British column. With White
in their rear they will run extra
ordinary risks. They are said to
be concentrating at Grobler*!
Kloof, do>c to Colenso. British
movements in the direction of i
Weenen look like an attempt to :
get around the enemy's flank.
Despite the silence, the situa
tion in Natal is regarded as won
derfully improved. There are at
present (juite 30.000 British
troops in that district. Reinforce
ments are being rapidly pushed
to tht front. A good many guns
of great range are now added to
Hildyard's armament. His delay 1
must be owing to the breaking
down of bridges or his relative
paucity of cavalry, just as General j
Gatacre is delayed by the n<
sity of safeguarding Lord Methu
en*> communication from Boer
attack from the Orange Free
State.
Sir George Stewart White is
still more than a match for his
foes at Ladysmith. Much firing
was heard from the besi.
town in the early part of the
week.
That no news has arrived for
twenty-four hours from Moddcr
River may signify that Methueu's
telegraph wires have been cut.
This does not of necessity mean
that there is any danger of his
communications being perma
nently interrupted. It has not
been Methuen's business to clear

the country Â«Â«f l;i> a<lversaries,
but simply to ,u retr ct t<> Kiml)erlev.
From Boer sources comes the
information that on Saturday last
the defenders of Mafeking made
a sortie and attacked ElofTs
Fort; that several ambulance
trains left Pretoria on Sunday
last for the Free State, as though
hard fighting was expected,
owing to the British advance, and
that Fort Tali, on the Rhodesian
frontier, where Colonel Plummer
is in command, was to be at
tacked.
No news of any kind has come
from Xauwpoort or Qn
town. TheÃritiah (orces are be
lieved to he on the eve of strik
ing a blow. Probably they are
attempting to catch the Boers â

INSULAR POLICY AND
ARMY REORGANIZATION
Two Important Subjects Dealt With
in Secretary Root's First
Annual Report.
WASHINGTON. Dec. I.â Dealing as It
does with large questions of Insular pol
, Icy, of army reorganization, of the future
' of Cuba and of the campaign in the Phil
ippines, the first annual report of Secre
tary Root. Just made public, is of excep
tional Interest.
Frequent reference is made to the re
port, of General Otis to show the magni
| tude of the task set for him in the Philip
pines with the inadequate forces at his
: command when the outbreak came, and a
high tribute Is paid to the courage of the
troops, which, in the face of great hard
l ships, voluntarily consented to forego an .
Immediate return to their homes upon the !
; expiration of their terms of service. The
i history of the operations of the past sea
, son Is recounted, and the Secretary out
\ lines the plan of the present campaign,
which began In October. This Involved
the movement of three separate forces.
i One was to proceed up the Bio Grande,
along the northeastern borders of the
plains, and strike across to the Gulf of
LJngayen. Another was to land on the
| gulf short by transports and proceed
along the coast road to .unite with the
first force. A third column was to strike
- straight along the railroad to Dagupun.
The Secretary says these movements were
executed with energy, rapidity and sue
cesa, notwithstanding deluges of rain.
A chapter tells of what has been done
In Cuba by the army during the past yÂ«ar.
Order has been maintained, social dis
tress has bÂ«en alleviated, sanitation has
I been instituted, and in all respects satis
factory progress has been mode, and the
part played by our troops now is but the
restraining influence of their presence.
As order has been restored the force of
troops has been reduced and orders have
been given recently for the withdrawal of
; eight companies of infantry and eight
troops of cavalry.
In Porto Rico the year has â¢ been de
voted to administering and improving the
clvi; government of the Island and in
structing the people In the rudiments of
self-government, at every step in confer
ence with leading citizens.
A compliment is paid to General Lud
ington's administration of the quarter
master's department, and it is said that
owing to the experience acquired the' en
tire movement Involved in the transpor-
I tation of a large army: to the Philippines
has been accomplished practically with
out lot's of life, disease or injury to
health. The clothing of the army, too,
was satisfactory, and the food of good
quality and furnished promptly. The health
of the army has been remarkably good,
and the report shows that the death rate
among the soldiers in the Philippines from
disease is only 17.20â considerably lees
: than In Washington. Hoston. San Fran
cisco, New York and Baltimore. The sol
' diers killed in battle and dying of wounds
numbered 477. and the entire mortality
was Â£43 rÂ«r the past ten month*.
The Secretary deals at great length with
! the problem of Insular government. He
recalls the fact that tho treaty of Paris
1 places in Congress alone the determina
tion of the civil representative* ana po
litical status of the native Inhabitants of
the territories ceded to the United States.
He argue* that this limitation completely
deprives these people of the right to have
! the Islands treated as States, or as terri
tory previously acquired ha* been treated,
or even to assert a legal right under the
! provision of the constitution which was
established for the people of the United
States themselves. Nevertheless, he as-
I sumes that the Intention la to give them,
to the greatest possible extent. Individual
: freedom, self-government In accordance
with their capacity, Just and equal laws
> and an opportunity for education, for
profitable industry and for development
j and civilization. He takes up Porto Rico
| first, as presenting the simplest problem,
and after discussing the present condi
tions there, emphasizing the ignorance of
the people of any modern system of gov
ernment, he holds that they should be
provided with the kind of administration
' to which we have been accustomed, with
Just as much participation on their part
: as Is possible without enabling their in
! experience to make it ineffective, and with
opportunities for them to increase their
I capacity for government. The Secretary
I lays stress upon past failures because of
j the refusal of a defeated minority to par
, ticipate further in government, which he
says Is precisely the cause of the con
tinual revolutions In the West Indies and
Central America, and marks a rudimen-
I tary stage of political development
To meet the case, he suggests a statu
tory declaration as to what laws shall be
; extended to the Porto Ricans. with pro
vision for Federal officers to execute
them. and. for a Federal Judiciary, with
appeal to the United States Supreme
Court. There should be a form of local
i Insular government subject to Congres
sional limitation, a Governor appointed
by the President and confirmed by the
i Senate, the chief officers appointed In like
, manner, and a legislative council com
posed of the chief officers of the State
and a minority selected by the President
from the citizens of the Island. The mu
nicipalities are to be governed by May-
I ors and Councils elected by them, with
.officers subject to removal by the Gov
: ernor. It would be better to wait for a
i time before an elective Legislature be
permitted. Suffrage should be limit. to
â  those who read and write or own a small
amount of property. Porto Ricann should
be chosen for offices they are able to nil.
American officials should be limited in
; number to the barest necessities and
should then be chosen by civil service
methods. Education should be nt the cost
of the community, defrayed from the in
sular treasury, and if necessary assisted
by the United States. The Spanish Civil
Code should be continued in force, with
such radical modifications as experience
suggests. The Secretary says that the
trouble has not been that the law was
I defective or vicious, but that It was never
fairly and honestly administered. Any
I attempt to substitute In these 'southern
I Islands a system of laws based on the
1 experience and characteristics of a New
j England community would be both op
pressive and futile. ' i
It Is pointed out that a similar course
to that Just outlined was successfully fol
lowed by ourselves In Louisiana and by
the English In Lower Canada.
Much stress Is laid on the Industrial dis
tress resulting from the inability of the
Porto Ricans to market their goods, ow
ing to the withdrawal of the Spanish
market, which was their former reliance
and to our own tariff. The secretary says
It is essential that Porto Rico should re
ceive substantially the same treatment at
our hands V* she received from Spain
wfcil* a colony, and that the markets of
the United States should be opened to
her as were the markets of Spain and
Cuba before the transfer of allegiance.
Concerning Cuba, the report says the
control which we are exercising in trust
for the people of Cuba should not, and,
of course, will not be continued any
longer than Is necessary to enable the
people to establish a suitable government
: to which the control shall be transferred,
' which shall really represent the people of
Cuba and be able to maintain order and
discharge International obligations. That
government, when established, must solve
or Cubs the problems we are to solve as
to Porto Rico.
The conduct of the Cuban people Is said
to be admirable. There have been.agita
: tors, but the substantial body of edu
cated Cubans has shown Itself to be pa
triotic, appreciative and . helpful, while
the treat body of uneducated Cubans has
been patient and law-abiding. It Is point
ed out that the Inability of two-thirds
of the people to read and write, their lack
of experience In government and the fac
tional feeling left by bloody conflicts
make it necessary to proceed somewhat
Slowly In the formation of a government.
It Is said that by the termination of the
year allowed by treaty for the Spanish
population to. elect whether to become
Cubans or remain Spaniards, It will be for
the first time possible to determine who
are Cuban citizens entitled to take part
In that government. By that dateâ April
11 nextâ the census will have been com
pleted and we shall be ready to provide
for municipal elections, placing local gov
ernment In the hands of th.- citizens, and
these local governments will form a rep
resentative convention to frame a consti
, tution and provide for a general govern
' ment of the island, to which the United
States will surrender the reins of govern
ment. - â . ~ : , , .
The Secretary devotes some attention to
j the unfortunate plight of. the Cuban bu
j gar producers, owing" to the competition j
of Euiopean beet sugar, with possible
free sugar from Porto Rtco and discrimin
ating duties In favor of West Indian su
gar He shows that, paying our duty, the
t Ã¼ban sugar would realize but 2.69 cents
per pound for the producer, against 2.71
cents for the German, and suggests as a
curative measure some tariff arrange
l by which Cuban products may be
imported Into the United States on the
same term? as those proposed for Ja
maica in the pending reciprocity treaty.
tx tended statements as to government
in the Philippine* are waived because of
t ie full r.] I( ,rt whkh will be presented by
â¢ Rtlfppine Commission. Reference is
ie negotiations between General
and the Sultan of Sulu, and it is
pointed out that it is not only subjeot to
resslonal approval but the Sultan has
Informed that such approval should
with it the cm, sent of the
I nlted States to the existence of slavery
fn the !'-'.;ir..l.s.
A strong recommendation Is made for i
the laying of a Pacific cable as a matter
of great military and political importance.
The cost of such a cable Is placed at not :
exceeding $8,500,000. running by way of
Hawaii. Wake Island and Guam, from
San Francisco to Manila.
The Secretary deal* In a forceful man
ner with the subject of post exchanges.
He expresses hi* agreement with the con
struction of the statute on this point as
laid down by the Attorney General, and !
produces statistic* from the United States
forces at posts and elsewhere to show
that the overwhelming testimony of
the army Is to the effect that
the present regulation has promoted
the temperance, discipline, morals and
1 health of the enlisted men and that in the
Interest of morality and effective service
it should be retained. The Secretary
says:
The political question to be eonuldered It not
whether folders .-!. uld drink or not drink but
whether they should be permitted to drink beer
in camp, surrounded by the restraining influ
ences of discipline ,in. i pood association, or
w i!* t , hrh ' r thÂ»v -no uld be driven to drink bad
wnlskjr In the vile reports which clutter around
the limit* of every military pom and camp and
especially around those in which prohibition la
maintained. I have no doubt that the present
regulation furnishes thÂ« wise answer to this
question.
Under the head of river and harbor
improvements the Secretary. while
characterizing these estimates as gener
ally meritorious, say* that he has felt it
necessary, in view of the extraordinary !
appropriations for military purposes, to
reduce the estimates of the chief of en
gineers from 121,908,821 to $14,593,741.
â¢nlier recommendation* are that Gen
oral Shaftor should be retired with the
rank of major general, and that a statute
01 General Grant should be erected in the
national capital.
one of the most Important chapters of
the â  port deals with the subject of army
reorganization, and on this point the Sec
retary makes some radical recommenda
tions, pointing out the Inadequacy of the
present system and Insufficiency of the
force. Starting with the promise that the
real object of having an army is to pro
vide for war. and thai the regular army
would never be by Itself the whole ma
chine with which war would be fought,
the Secretary proceeds to outline a
scheme of reform supported at each stage
by Huecinct argument to demonstrate Its
necessity. He first lay* down the neces
> sity of a systematic study by responsible
ofllcers of plans of action under all con
tingencies of possible conflict, and point.*
out the lamentable disadvantage we are
in in this respect, as shown by our past
experience, more especially with regard
to the mobilization and encampment and
training of volunteer troops. Next there
should be ample preparation of material
of war, keeping pa. with the progress
of military science and avoiding the state
of unprepared ness in which we were
found at the outbreak of the last war.
This should be thew business of competent
men. There should be an adequate
process of selection according to merit
and effectiveness among the officers of
the army, so that men of superior ability
and power may be placed in position of
responsibility and authority. Fourth.
; there should be ample exercise and train-
Ing of the army in the movements of
large bodies approximating war condi
tions. -V â¢â¢'
lt Is recommended that an army war
college i"- established. Including the major
general commanding and composed of the
heads of staff departments and a number
of the ablest high ranking officers In the
army, and to this college should be en
trusted the execution of the plans laid
out under the foregoing four heads. Every
officer below the field officers not a grad
uate of the service schools should receive
Instruction at this college. All staff ap
pointments should thereafter be made
from the line of the army for only a fixed
period of say four or live years, the older
to return to the line at the end of that
period, and these staff appointments
should be made on the war college records
of efficiency and fitness, making allow
ance for gallant conduct In the field, and
excepting only tho technical branches of
engineer, ordnance and signal service.
The present system of promotion by sen
iority should be modified as to officers be
low field rank by dividing the promotions
between those based ' on seniority and
those based on efficiency and gallantry.
Staff appointment* and line promotions i
other than those for seniority should be
made by board officers based on efficiency
and records.
There should bo active co-operation be
tween the army and navy In the matter of
their respective war colleges to provide
for Joint defense and action.
The artillery branch of the service
should have a head, a member of the war
college, and on the staff of the major gen
eral commanding, and the Inspection
corps should be Increased.
Turning to the volunteer element, which
must be relied upon to supplement the
regular army in case of war, the Secre- .
tary lays stress on the Importance of pre
serving the same forms of discipline, j
using the same arms and generally Insur
ing that the united body shall be homo
geneous when assembled. ' This matter j
should receive the especial attention of i
the war college, which should invite the I
confidence and co-operation of state and
military authorities, and open Its courses ,
of Instruction to national guard officers. I
In this way. the Secretary foresees, an
elastic machinery will be provided, so that
when war threatens and long before It is
declared the multitude of men who are to j
do the work of organization may know i
without waiting for an act of Congress ]
what will be required, of them when the '
hour striken and may be engaged In the '
quiet and deliberate preparation for neces- i
sity in advance of action to prevent con- '
fusion and mistakes.
The Secretary declares that the faith
ful and efficient services of the West
Point graduates -since the declaration of
war with Spain have more than repaid
the cost of the military academy since Its
foundation, and he asks for a consider- ,
able Increase i n the capacity of the Insti
tution and the number of Its graduates.
The. report draws to a conclusion with a
splendid tribute to the army's showing
during the past two years and irlves credit
to the officers of the volunteer force for
a large prÂ»Â»Â»r<Â» ln*thtn Tht*vÂ»ment.

Head of the Interior Department Rec
ommends That the Government

Irrigation.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. Dec. I.â The annual
report of Secretary of the Interior Hitch
cock, made public to-night, while sum
ming up the work In all the bureaus, is
of especial Interest by reason of Its state
ments regarding pension policies. At the
close of the fiscal year there were 3?1,r>19
pensioners, a decrease of 2195 during the
year. The average annual value of nil
pensions was $132 74. The Spanish war
probably will Increase the pensions dur
ing the coming fiscal year. The Secretary
concurs In the recommendations provid
ing that no pension be granted to com
mence prior to the date of filing the
claim, and urges legislation to definitely
construe the act of June 27, 1890, relating
to widows' pensions. Regarding this he
says:
In order to more exactly define the
word* "means of support," I approve the rec
ommendation of the Commissioner of Pensions
that the act of June 27, IS9O. be so amended
that a pensionable status be granted to widows
whole income. Independent of the proceeds of
their dally labor. is not in excess of {250 per
annum.
The report recommends legislative au
thority for biennial examinations of pen
sioners; legislation prohibiting the ->ay
ment of "any compensation whatever 10
pension attorneys and agents for any
service in connection with any claim or
proceedings under the pension laws, ex
cept as such may within certain limits be
fixed by Congress."
Secretary Hitchcock makes public an
advance report of the Maritime Canal !
Company of Nicaragua dated December
4 next, setting forth that since the or
| ganization of the company 10,145 shares of
the capital stock have been subscribed
for at par, amounting in the aggregate
to the sum of $1,014,500, of which amount
H,008,8)0 has been paid Into the treasury
In cash; that there has been paid Into trie
treasury from other sources $155,776 51.
making the total amount of cash received
1,161.600 61. The company has paid for
property', work and labor done and ma
terials furnished In the construction of J
the canal and in administration $1,601.
772 70 in cash, 31.9 M share* of the full paid
capital stock of- the company of the pÂ«tr
value of $3,199,000, 1150.000 of its first mort
gage bonds and its obligations for $6,7u.>.
uMt of tin- said first mortgage bonds. It
has also issued 180,000 shares of Its capital
stock of the par value of $1fc.000.000 in pay
ment for coneâ rlÃhts, privileges,
franchises and other property.
The liabilities of the company consist of
amounts still due under the concessions
granted to the company, of the $5,71)5.000
of bonds before mentioned, the said bonds
being due to the assignee of the Nicar
agua Canal Construction Company for
work and labor done and materials fur
nished in the execution of the work of
constructing the canal, and other such lia
bilities outstanding and unpaid, to an
amount not exceeding $200,000,
The assets of the company consist of 1U
unused capital stock, the $.*>IS.DOO flrst
moitgage bonds and the 2420 shares of
capital stock received In liquidation â¢ as
aforesaid, the concession, rights, privi
leges and franchises which it now owns,
and the plant, equipment and other prop
erty In Central America.
The Congressional assertion of its right
to determine the' line of canal - through
Nicaragua and Costa Rica under the con
cession of the company, according to the
company, caused uncertainty as to the
location of the rrtute, and. with other
causes, has made the resumption of the
work of construction Impossible. The
company incloses two formal protests, one
dated December 2. 189S, and the other Sep
tember R. 1599. to Secretary Hay. against
the agreement by the Nicaraguan Govern
ment for another canal concession, in vio
lation of the rights of not only the com
pany but of the United States and Costa
Rica. . .-
The report estimates the Irrigable area
of the arid region of the Unltod States at
74,000,000 acres, capable of comfortably
supporting, under a proper Irrigation sys
tem. 50.000.000 people. Reasonable expend
itures by both the Federal and State Gov
'. ernments looking to a well-defined irriga
i tion system are urged. Nearly fifty pro
posed new forest reserves or additions to
thoje already established are under con
sideration. VÂ»
! The Dawes commiPslon reports that the
time has not yet arrived for the installa
tion of a Territorial or State Government
In Indian Territory, owing mainly to lack
of uniform land tenures.
Attention Is called to theÂ« phenomenal
Increase In railway traffic In the last two
years, amounting approximately to an In
crease of earnings In 1R99, over 1599. of
$<Vnon <y>o. and of the previous year to $23.

the lack of cars to carry products.

GAME BIRDS ARE
FAVORED BY THE
PRESENT WEATHER
Quail. Grouse and Ducks Will
Not Suffer Much at the Hands
of Sportsmen.
DUCK shooting, hns boon almost
at a standstill for Â»>ome weeks
past, the- weather conditions be
ing against good sport on the
marshes. Birds are simply not to be
found in districts whore in former years
they were plentiful. Clubmen go to their
preserves regularly week after week and
return with little or nothing to show for
their trip. They ail have faith in the
birds coming later in the season and ex
pect to make up for lost time then.
The pport of the quail shooters has
also bern of poor quality, taken from a
broad j>olnt of view. In some instances
Individual bag* have been good, but the
average sportsman not affiliated with the
clubs has found little to tempt him into
the field week after week. This will work
a bv.nt.flt to the bird.-, as they have not
bfren subjected to the bombardment they
would receive if they were easily secured.
They will be. afforded an opportunity to
grow up and multiply, and ttius till the
gaps In their ranks. The same holds good
of ducks and grouse, which aro also
keeping away from the man with the
gun. 'i he quail slay In the. trees, as they
uo not like the wet ground, and dogs have
no opportunity to work them.
Achllle Koos and other sportsmen who
ehoot in the vicinity of San i'ablo Hay are
watching the methods of a market hunter
who has his headquarters there. He sent
to market recently 14a birds as the result
of a day's work, and the report has
gained currency that he uses illegal
methods. It in intimated he Is netting
Borne birds, and tbat what shooting he
dot-* is with an eight-bore gun. a size
not countenanced by law. Mr. Koos, who
is a thorough sportsman, has had but lit
tle shooting on his San Pablo preserve,
there being no birds on the ponds.
Three member of the Black Jack Club
â Fred Johnson, "Billy" Swain and Uert
Patrickâ shot over the club's Sherman
Island preserve last Sunday. A total of
nineteen birds fell to the three guns. They
were made up of widgeon, mallard and a
few black jacks. A heavy fog obscured
the ponds for a time, the birds being se
cured as It lifted for a â¢â¢ â .% minutes.
On Tuesday John Uemmer was in the
neighborhood on business, and after dis
posing of the work on hand had a try at
the ducks. He secured thirteen, mostly

unusually large flocks of ' "cans" llying

NAVAL MILITIA

Against "Midget" Crew at

NAVAL. Militia men on the Marlon
will organize a cutter crew, which
will issue challenges to the crews
of any foreign man-of-war that
may visit this port. The crew will bo
made up from all three divisions of the
Naval Battalion and will he. trained by
Henry Peterson. Tho Marlon has one of
the fastest racing cutters In the United
States navy and a new sot of cutter oars
has been purchased and specially trimmed
for racing. It is possible the officers may
organize a six-oared gig crew to pull
against the officers or visiting men-of
war.
Dr. C. C. Dennis, believing that racing
is the soul of any sport, Is in favor of
establishing regular races tO be held each
month among the members of the South
End Rowing Club. He thinks that prac
tice by oneself over .1 course is by no
means the same thing as rowing a race
and that the only way to pare satis
factorily for open races Is by holding club
regattas.
Now that the narrow-gauge mole at
Alamcda has been so much Improved it
will be easy to bold rowing races on Oak
land Creek. The dressing room for the
oarsmen, the grand stand for spectators,
the starling and finishing points can all be
on the mole. The contestants can step
from the dressing tent into their boats.
Kaces can be run off promptly and spec
tutors can return to San Francisco or to
their homes in Oakland or Alumeda di
rectly the events are over. THe railroad
company will lend a liberal support to the

The National Baseball League
Star Will Be Pitted Against

ALTHOUGH the Sacramento
champions met defeat In their
first game with the all-star aggre
gation of high-salaried ball- toners
from National League cities, they have
the satisfaction of knowing they were
not outclassed. .There is do telling what
might have happened if Stanley had â¢ â â¢â¢'.
missed thÂ« train. Stanley is the main
stay of tho champions and his absence
proved disastrous. Captain Sullivan of
: the Friscos, who oitlciated behind the
bat, is a gcod backstop, but â¢be never
handled Harvey's delivery before, and.
besides, the team work of the Sacramci
tos was all now to him. As a conse
quence he was responsible for a least
two of thÂ» runs scored by the All-Call
fomions. Stanley will be in the game to
day and to-morrow and his fellow-cham
pions are confident the] will capture a
majority of the series. The Sunday game
is of course the one that will attract the
most attention, as It will be a content
between ray Hughes, the kingpin t wirier
of the country, and South Paw Harvey,
who has been drafted by Chicago for
next season. The 5000 people at the ball
game Thursday went wild with enthusi
asm over Harvey's work in :he box. lie
struck out such men as Van Haitre'i.
Reltz, Lockhead and Hughes, and held
the whole team down to three weak bits,
two of which were of the scratch order.
Harvey is a star of the first magnitude
and is capable of making even Hughes
look to Ills laurels.
"Kid" Hulen, who was to have played
with the â¢ All-Callfornlans Thursday,

OAKLAND GOLFERS
WILL QUALIFY AT
PRESIDIO LINKS
Final Rounds of Thanksgiving
Day Handicaps to Be Played
at San Rafael.
SEVERAL. Oakland golfers visited
the Presidio links on Thanksgiv
ing day with the Intention of try
ing to qualify for the opÂ«n com
petition, match play, to be given under
the auspices of the Oakland and San
Francisco clubs on the r .Â»th Inst. Vice,
Captain P. E. Bowles and another Oak
land pliiy.r went around the course with
David Suphenson (who has returned from
San Jose) as scorer. E. It. FotgOT and K.
M Fitzgerald also played over the I*re
sidio course, but decided to wait until
Sunday before trying to qualify for the
open tournament. Several ladles were
out on the links, amung them being Mrs.
Chcnery and Mrs. \V. G. Miller. The qual
ifying rounds for the open tournament aro
at eighteen holes, medal play, and It I*
likely many players will endeavor to qual
ify this afternoon and to-morrow. Secre
taries H. M. A. Miller and S. I* Abbot Jr.
have received replies from several clubs
on the Pacific Coast to the circulars in
viting members to enter the tournament,
and hope to have golfers from Portland,
Tacoma and Southern California among
the competitors. The sixteen players who
make the lowest scores In the qualifying
rounds, which must be played beforo tho
9th last., the first day of the tournament,
will be eligible tv play in the tournament.
In the opening and second rounds the play
will bo over eighteen holes, but In the
seml-llnal and final rounds ii wIU bo over
thirty-six holes.
So many of the Oakland golfers wero
attracted to Son Francisco to witness the
Thanksgiving day football match that the
handicap mixed foursomes tot stiver
trophies were not pluyed. and even the i- -
ceptlon and musicule in the clubhouse did
not take place. The Oakland schedule of
events has not been lived up to for the
past two months, the players having Â»Â»- Â« i>
more anxious to improve their game un
der the tuition of Anderson and Itawlins
than to play in competitions.

"THE LEADING PEOPLE."
T â VEPEATEDLY from both army and navy of-
Ly iiccrs and from -many in civil life has come the
* * rtatefnent that in Cuba only "the leading peo
ple" shouid be consulted about the fate of the island.
c are described as the wealthy people, who lead
only ia the sense of having property. They are rep
resented M wishing annexation to the United States
land the advice is not lacking that we maintain mili
tary government of th* island, exclude all but "the
. . " from the franchise and then take a
vi te on annexation. We do not hesitate to denounce
this scheme as a national crime of the first order.
Were these "leading people" in arms righting for in
! dependence and enduring the sore persecution of
I Spain? No. Are "they people in whose behalf we
I declared war? No Are they the patriots who
'. were eulugized in our Congress as the equals of our
j revolutionary forefathers? No. Were they the
I starving recoticentrados who were the victims of
Weyler's decree? No. Vet we propose to disfran
1 rhise the entire class of people who made the insur
rection, did the fighting, furnished the martyr*,
aspired to freedom and had so cemented Cuba libre
' with their blood that our Congress declared it to be,
j and to be of right, independent. All these are to be
t Ragged, their voices are to be silent, their wish
i ignored, their sacrifices forgotten and the country they
bled for and the independence for which so many
died are to be sold out from under them by the votes
bf "the leading people."
We raise the voice of warning and alarm against
the United States assuming anywhere to base policy
, and government upon the foundation of "the leading
Thi-. republic was founded mainly against this same
â¢f "lrading people." The plain and largely un
lettered folk fought for it and won its independence.
Israel i'utnam couid barely write his name, but his
â  â¢te liberty so large that the far nations
. it. John Starke was not one of the lead
a rough, unlettered man. but he expressed
his opinion of liberty at Bennington in a way that
l the hearts of the plain people to this day.
There has been too much of thiÂ« preference of the
01 of "the leading people" in diha .md the
Philippines ami Hawaii If we create government
d D the lines of wealth and position, ignoring
we are establishing an an.-tneracy as
' is any in the world ( >ur plain people at
home will not fail t<-> see that government by. for and
; le" anywhere is the deadly enemy
â¢ the whole people.
;n.; n. lei u< remind the men who are planning this
cr:m< â¢ that the iwie will finally go to judg
â¢ in this country nnd will be passed upon not by
"the leading people."' but by the whole people, and in
that day of judgment it may go hard with the men
the nine-tenth* of plain people
"the leading people** only, take their
wiÂ»h as ample reason for committing the crime of
breaking our wnfd to the world and violating our
<c of independence to the Cuban patriots.
Another accident that would have been frightful in
its sacrifice of human life hai been narrowly averted
on the Oakland mole. If this sort of thing continues
local poolse'.lers will be selling mutuels on the chances
of a safe ride on Southern Pacific trains.
HON. BRIGHT ROBERTS.
>Â« R. RORF.RTS of Utah ha? the rare distinction
/ \ of being a national issue. As such he is
* * "viewed with alarm." and. as far as is known,
is not pointed to with pride outside his several do
mestic esr. ts, where his record as a father
i to be first c!. I lia> put up money
enough to hire the best lawyers in the country, who
will submit a list of the Mesdames Roberts to Con
and appeal to that t>",!y to avoid the contami
nating contact of such a niultiwived member. As two
of these lawyers, Mr. Edmonds and Mr. Carlisle, have
been in Congress, they urill i i unore to the
of keeping pure the reputation ot that vestal
Various defenses are being put up for Mr. Roberts.
The best of them is in the form of a legal argument
made by himself. He says he married his fine string
rea before tit admission of Utah as a State under
a constitution forbidding sm-h marriages. He denies
having married any more since that time and defies
any one to point out any prohibition in the Utah
constitution that forbids him living with the wives
he married before. There is in this argument a
question of very serious weight The Utah constitu
tion is not retroactive: therefore it does not affect
Mr. Roberts' several weldings. Just how it treats
his living with more than one woman we don'i know,
but we doubt whether the fact of such association it
adequate legal ground for refusing him a seat in
â¢ : for expelling him when seated.
If Mr. Roberts have a lawyer he may bring among
hiÂ« authorities the case of the woman taken in adul
tery and about to be stoned to death, but who was
saved by confining the execution to such in the
crowd ts were themselves without sin. It may be
that if the Speaker of the next House should (ling a
bo hit Roberts for the offense charged a ma
jority of the members would duck their heads â but,
then, public opinion must and shall be respected.
Senator Rawlins of Utah has made a less strong de
fense of Roberts, in which he denies that polygamy
is tolerated in Utah.
We outsiders are well aware that the heart of man
is prone to evil as the sparks to fly upward, and we
We outsiders are well aware that the heart of man
is prone to evil as the sparks to fly upward, and we
also know that punishment of plural marriages in
Utah, whether called polygamy or unlawful co
habitation, is in the hands of juries, and we very
much douhf whether testimony enough ran ever be
produced in such cases to prevent a Mormon iury
giving an ?.ccused polygamist the benefit of a doubt.
An anti-polygamy amendment to the Federal consti
tution is the proper remedy, but as that would con
tlir* with our pledge to our new fellow-citizen, the
Sultaii of Sulu, we doubt whether Congress will pro
j o*e it.
If Governor Gage could hide himself from public
view as successfully as he hides public documents
from inspection it is not likely that any one would
demand an order of court for him to show himself.
THE COMING CONGRESS.
WHEN the determination of Tom Reed to retire
from Congress was announced and it became
known that a new man would have to be chosen
for the Speakership of this Congress a movement was
started to bring about a change in the rules under
which the Imvine.-s of the House is carried on It
was well known there had been a good dea] of objec
tion to the vast powers given to the Speaker under
the Reed rule^nd it was believed the objectors were
sufficiently strong to make pure of a change
Later reports from Washington show it is by no
means certain that the advocates of the old system of
leaving the House to govern itself will succeed in
their efforts. Their campaign of last summer against
THE SAN FRANCTSCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 2. 1899.
the Reed rules was, it appears, much more declama
tory than effective. .Mr. Henderson, the prospective
Speaker, is said to have declared himself in favor of
retaining the Reed rules and his voice will go a long
way toward deciding the question.
There are very strong reasons why the rules
under which Mr. Reed managed to enable the House
to attend to business despite the efforts of a turbulent
minority to prevent it should be continued at this
session. There is a great deal of business that ought
to be attended to and much of it is of urgent import
ance. The money question presents two distinct
issues, that of fixing the standard beyond the power
of a President to tamper with and that of reforming
our banking and currency system, and each of these
should be dealt with promptly. To these may be
added as matters of urgency the passage of a mer
chant marine bill, a_j-evision of the war revenue act,
the establishment of a form of government for Hawaii
and Porto Rico, the enactment of the Nicaragua
Canal bill and a bill providing for more stringent re
strictions upon immigration.
Each of these measures is sure to meet with strong
opposition. There will be a fight made against evcy
one of them and in the contest the opponents of the
measure will not hesitate to make use of all means of
delay which the rules of the House may place in their
power. It is certain then that if the Reed rules be set
aside the new Speaker will be seriously handicapped in
his efforts to keep the House in order and hasten the
accomplishment of public business.
General Henderson can be safely trusted with all
the powers given to Speaker Reed. He has attained
the position of prospective successor to Reed with
out having to resort to any intrigue or wire-pulling to
accomplish it. As soon as it was known that Reed
would retire the thoughts of a majority of the Re
publicans of the House turned to General Henderson
and he became their candidate without solicitation on
his part. Under these circumstances he enters the
contest for the Speakership with such assurances of
support as will enable him to attain the office un
hampered by any pledges which would interfere with
the just and right fulfillment of its duties. There can
therefore be no valid reason for taking from him any
of the powers vested in his predecessor and it is to be
hoped no effort to do so will be successful.
British generals continue to claim victories in their
reports from South Africa, but still there is nothing
in them which inclines the folks at home to have a
season of thanksgiving.
WHILE we recognize the need of wisdom and
conservatism in expenditures ffto t public im
provements, we also recognize the right of
the people to act directly upon the issue of bonds for
purposes that are beyond the reach of an immediate
tax icvy.
San Francisco has enjoyed the distinction of beinÂ£
the only large city in the Union with practically no
bonded debt. Thanks to the wisdom of Frank
McCoppin and other early administrators of
city aftairs, the government of San Francisco
has never gone far astray from the interests
of the people, and such charges as have been brought
against any part of the city government have rarely
related to vicious handling of public money. With t
good reputation, as the reputations of cities go, San
Francisco may well add thereto a Character that comes
from adequate public improvements.
The plans now proposed for additional park facili
ties, more sewers and better and schoolhouses that
are modern are not of recent origin. Hon. Frank
Xewlands, a dozen years ago. published a compre
hensive essay on what might be done to make the
best use of San Francisco's climatic and scenic ad
vantages, in which all that is now proposed was
pointed out, and many more improvements were sug-
gcÂ«t< â¢â ! .md discussed. Mr. Newlaadf still shares in
the control of large properties here, although now a
citizen and public character of Nevada. Since he has
represented that State in Congress he has been a
large investor in Washington City and is competent
to speak of the effect of fine public improvements,
parks, sewers and public buildings \ipon real estate.
Washington, though in a trying climate, has of late
years become the fashionable residence city of the
East, because of its beautiful boulevarded and
smoothly paved streets and its large number of parks,
pleasure grounds and fine public drives. If it is said
th.it people go there to live, drawn by the fact that, it
is the capital of the republic and the center of all the
attractions and pageantry of government, an error
is uttered. Everything iliat Washington City has now
of pomp and circumstance she had when Pennsyl
vania avenue was a mudhole in which inaugural pro
cessions mired down unless the mud were frozen hard
enough to bear a load on the 4th of March. But no
one then chose it as a place of residence, and the
officers of the Government spent as much time out
side the District of Columbia as possible. But
Washington has changed since then. It has been
made one of the most beautiful cities in the world,
and people who are able to live where they please go
there. Mr. Cleveland while in his first term changed
the Presidential custom of living elsewhere, and
bought a charming place within the District as a pri
vate home for his family.
The hundreds of rich families which have made
homes there within the last twenty years make the
city a better business place than it used to be when
its retail trade depended solely upon the Government
officers ajjd clerks in the departments.
San Francisco, with everything desirable in cli
mate and set in the midst of the most inspiring natu
ral scenery, owes it to herself to make better use of
her many natural advantages by calling art to adorn
her with proper public improvements. The effect of
such improvements cannot fail to be good.
The trouble with the Harpers seems to have been
due to a belief that they had a sure thing and so they
neglected to keep up with the age in the way of
machinery and business methods. The new manage
ment purposes to begin by equipping the business
with an up-to-date plant and may therefore be ex
pected to flourish, for a plant suited to the age is a
plant that will grow.
There is a disposition on the part of Washington
officials to make General Wood the surgeon generil
of the United States army. This seems ominous
in conjunction with the report that the Cubans are
determined to revolt. Their anatomy has not been
studied for nothing by General Wood.
There is a rumor that the President will send to
this Congress one of the longest messages on rec
ord, but as the rumor is not based upon absolutely
sure authority we can still hope for better things.
The piemakers of New England and New York
have organized a trust. This ought to bring the
pains and discomforts of dyspepsia within the reach
of even the poorest.
It is about even betting whether the Boer besiegers
or the British relievers will get into Ladysmith first.

to mind his own business, and after
threaienir.sr to notify the Police Commis
sioners of his strange conduct boarded
an electric car intending to go to her
home at S Roscoe street. When within
*/Â«*" te * 1 ct her domicile the man whom
v ollwebber desired her to sp^ak to ac
costed her and grabbed her around the
waist. Miss Young lustily screamed for
neip and as her assailant refused to re
lease hÂ«r she struck him across the face
with an umbrella. As hÂ« stajreerM from
the afreets of the blow Miss" Young 1 ran
toward her home.
When near the irate leading to her house
the fiend overtook her. and grabbing her
by the throat attempted to strangle h*r.
Realizing she was in the bands of a des
perate man Miss Young successfully
struggle to frÂ«HÂ» herself from his grasp
and again raising her umbrella she
brought it down on her assailant's head.
"lth a cry of rage he renewed the at
tack and again grabbing the brave wo
man by the throat tried to strangle her.
After a short struggle Miss Young,
with the aid of her umbrella, which sh.Â»
St^i wUh " ns =S effect, succeeded in
Â».ghtir.g of? her desperate assailant. V
citizen who was pa^sir.^ at the time
heard her screams and quickly went to
r.^r assistance. The man. becoming
alarmed, took to his heels and was soon
lost in the darkness. Miss Young was
then escorted to her home and a doctor
sent for. Beyond a few slight bruises
on her throat and arms It wa3 found
that she was uninjured.
The_ following day. Miss Young visited
the seventeenth-street station and re
ported the occurrence to Captain Glllen.
HÂ». S rt:iff of, Woll Webber's connection
with the assault Glllen w?nt for the ac
cused officer and demanded an explana

to M!ss \our.g and claimed he knÂ«w
nothing of the assault on her. SatisflM
that the young woman was telling the
truth Gillen had Wollwebber and six
ti*?a other oGlcers stand in a row while
Miss Young Inspected them. She was told
to pick out the policeman who had
spoken to h<r on the night that she was
assaulted, and after glancing down th->
line she readily recognized Wollwebber a*
the man who had first insulted her ThiÂ»
matter was reported to Captain Bohen
and he detailed Detective Crockett on
the case.
By dint of investigation Crockett
learned that the young man who as
saulted Miss Young is named Forsytbe
and that he Is on very Mindly terms
with Wollwebber. He lives in the vicin
ity af Miss Young's home, but has dis
appeared sine* the assault. To-day
charges. will be filed against Vollwebber
with the Police Commissioners.
The accused officer was formerly a
sergeant of police, but was dismissed
from the department for neglecting his
family to live with a creature of the ten
derloin. He was reinstated as a patrol
man only a short time ago and assigned
to duty in the Mission.
SHOT HIMSELF WITH A
SHOPKEEPER'S PISTOL
SHORTLY before " o'clock last evening, a man giving the name of John
Smith and claiming to be a recrnt arrival from I-o<3i. Cal.. shot himself
in the left breast in the gunatore of L Bachmann. at 723 Clay street.
The wound was inflicted with evident intent to commit suicide, although
the man persists that he shot himself accidentally. It is doubtful whether he
will survive his injuries.
Bachmann's attention was first attracted to the man when he entered the
store and asked to see a pistol. He spoke deliberately and appeared to be In
trouble. During the conversation he stated that he had lost a pistol belonging
to one of his friends and was required to purchase another to replace it. He was
handed a large forty-four Colt revolver and asked that it be loaded. "When
this was done he requested that Bachmann find him a cartridge belt. The lat
ter turned his back for a moment to go to a drawer and while he was making
a search for the belt he heard a shot and saw the stranger drop to the floor.
At the Harbor Hospital Dr. Thompson found that the bullet had entered
the left breast and passed entirely through the body. When the man was asked
for his name he replied that It was John Smith and that he came from Lodi.
It is thought that this reply was simply an attempt to conceal his true iden
tity. The man was about 40 years of age and appeared to be a laboring man.
No papers of any description were found en his person.
THE PAX FKA^CISCO CALL. SATUEDAT, DZCEMBEE 2, 1899.
LUMBER COMBINE
TO CONTROL THE
REDWOOD FOREST
Many Local Dealers
Interested.
â â¢
WILL HAVE CLOSE MONOPOLY
â¦
CONTROLLING INTEREST HELD
BY EASTERN MEH.
â¢
For many years capitalists of thÂ« Pa
cl*g C?3.?t ha.vg mr|Â« va!*^ fÂ»Tnr< til
organize a combination with sufficient
capital to control the vast redwood lum
ber Interests of this State, the enormous '
amount of money required being the ,
great rock on which every venture split. ;
A few months ago Volney Foster of
Chicago came to this coast and secured
options from all the large lumber com
panies and land-owners and then started
East to organize a company and float
stocks and bonds.
The securing of capital was an under
taking of no little work, as at the time
the boom in trust organizations was fit
a low ebb and money scarce. About a
week since the options expired and Fos
ter was compelled to ask for an exten
sion of time. With the assurances given
by Foster of ultimate success thÂ« option*
were in nearly all cases renewed, and It
Is almost a certainty that in the course of
a few days the redwood lumber trust will
be a matter of record.
It Is open talk among the lumber men
of th:- city that George D. Gray of the
firm of Gray &. Mitchell, and E. J. Holt
are the reprsentatlves of the combination ;
for the Pacific Coast.
Mr. Gray admits that he and practi
cal^ all the big dealers are Interested in
the "deal, but refeses to speak further of
the matter, saying that the doings of the
combination are as yet not of public
concern. . .
If the Foster syndicate succeeds tn
buying out the California lumber men
It will become the owner of a splendid
domain and will have a close monoply.
All the redwood timber In the world
U grown in an area of 2000 . .are miles,
or iSO d*) acres, and this area Is In the
form of a long. Irregular belt, ranging
In width from ten to twenty miles, and
extending through the northern coast
counties of this State. The redwood
grows only wh*Â»re It Is encompassed by
the fogs and damp winds from the Pa
rirtc Ocean. Henry Gannett of the United
States Geological Society has estimate
the amount of standing timber In the red
wood forests at T3.000.000.G00 feet.
IRELAND REVISITED.
Father Peter C. Yorke to Deliver a
Lecture at St. Peter's To-Mor
ro-v Evening.
"Ireland Revisited" is the title of a
lecture to te Riven in St. Peter's Church
to-morrow evening. Owing to the silence
of the telegraphic agencies little is known
In this country of recent developments in
the "Old Land." Wltn the-je develop

Ireland the well-known priest lectured to
large au.ller.ces and his lectures are still
the subject of much discussion through
out the country-
An attempt is being made at present to
awaken n<Â»w interest in tha Irish strug

there are many Irishmen who are anxious
to hear from the lips of an Independent
witness tiie value of the claims made
by the propagandists of these new move
ments.
Father Y<vke will discuss tiiese. claims
in his lecture and from M standpoint of
ar.e who is not ashamed of his native land

DESIGNER OF UNIVERSITY
PLANS HERE FROM PARIS
MONS. E. BENARD, THE GREAT ARCHITECT.
mONSIEUR E. BENARD, the row world-renowr.ed architect, who
//\ff\ was awarded the flrst prize for his plans for the college buildings
f M.\ of the University of California, arrived In this city last night from
' Paris. France, via New York and Chicago. He took up quarters In
the Palace, where he was met by Mrs. Phetxj Hearst. Professor William
Carey Jones ar 4 d Professor Maybeck. professor of architecture at the uni
versity.
Mons. Benard. who is a pleasant looking gentleman of medium build, not
stout, did not tarry long with those around him. as he expressed himself
as fatigued after his trip across thÂ« continent. He. however, stated that
he had remained a short time in New York and in Chicago, and In reply to
questions, stated that he did not admire the tall buildings In the cities
named, as their effect was to shut out the sunlight and make the streets
gloomy. Such a building Isolated served well as a landmark and was well
enough, but a whole row of them was not up to his idea of propriety. The
architecture of New York did not evoke his admiration, except as to the
residence district. As to his own work, he said that the one of which he
Is the proudest Is the Young Men's Christian Association structure erected
with money contributed by an American. To conform to the Ideas of the
donator he came to the United States to study the gymnasium hall of like
buildings. When required to furnish the details of one structure in connec
tion with the plans for the university he turned his attention to the gym
nasium. He will remain in this city about three months, during which
he will devote his time to explaining in the fullest details the plans for the
college buildings and examining California architecture.
ARTISTS HAVE A
NEW GRIEVANCE
TO TALK ABOUT
The Art Association Is
Criticized.
LOCATION OF THE INSTITUTE
ONLY ONE ARTIST IS ON TEX
BOARD OF DIRECTORS.
Artists, like other men of talent and
genlu3. hive their troubles. The srief.
that vexes the spirit of the San Fran
cisco artist is caused by the management
of the Art Association. The Mark Hop
kins Institute of Art Is not exactly in the
place where a majority of artlsw would
have it, but Its location has less to do
with the general grievance than one
would conjecture.
When the picture painters are asked to
give the rea-son why the Art A
fails to meet the â¢xpaetattoOfl of artists
they reply: "'What can you expÂ«ct for

The artists cast no reflection on the In
telligence. Integrity or public spirit of the
directory, but simply Inquire, "What can
you expect from a board of directors bo
constituted?' The argument Is advanced
that an association to promote art should
be directed by artists, otherwise tt will
fall to fulflll the purpose of Its creation.
A3 the holiday season is near the artist*
are anxious to sell some of their pictures.
A few months ago a common agreement
waj made between the Bohemian Club
and the Art Association that the clubs
annual exhibition of paintings should be
postponed or canceled In order to give '
the right of way to the Art Association
exhibit in the new gallery. This decision
did not meet with anything like universal
favor in the studios. The painters main
tain that the pictures exhibited at the
club are seen by men who have the money
to buy work! of art. but not the leisure to
pay a visit to the institute on California
street hill.
"When the artists ascertained that th
new gallery on the hill would not be ready
for picture displays before next February
they applied to the directors of the club
to reconsider the proposition to cancel this '
year's club exhibition. In order to give
the painters belonging: to the club a chance
to get Che holiday breeze the club direct
ors rescinded the previous action.
An exhibition of the work of the &jt2j~
members of the club will be held In the
high Jinks room, commencing Monday.
December 4. and closing Saturday. De
cember IS. The directory has named four
public day?, when the friends of the mem
bers can enjoy the privileges of the exhi
bition. These days are: Wednesday, De
: cember 6: Saturday. December 9; Wednes
day. December 13. and Friday. December
14. Special tickets of admission for ladles
only will b*i Issued for Wednesday, De
cember 6.
There Is no friction between th<Â» Art
Association and the Bohemian Club, but
many of the artists belonging to the club
hold that false notions of courtesy should
not preclude the painter from the oppor
tunity of selling a picture before Christ
mas.

ent Ueputy Superintendent Marks has
r.ot Leon in hljrh favor with his super.or
for some months past and was told early j
in the campaign thut he coulci begin look- '
iiih' for another Job and take all the unit !
he nteded !rnm hi? current iuties .Since
that time Marks has been exerting every";
pull he wuld line up for an pppointme.u I
on the new School Board. He ha? at vim
time and another materia'ly assisted
Mayor Plulan In creating political capl
tal, artlcularli In numerous ca^es In j
which school affairs wen concerned, and '
it Is said that ha will be rewarded accord- ,
Inaly.
James renrr.an Is confident thnt he has
a lead pipe cinch on one of th. Democrat
ic jobs on the board and the friends he
has had working for him are folly as c<Â»r.- i
tident. Among the "pollles" his appoint- !
nient is considered a certainty. M. Green- )
t)latt. who was l'helan's candidate for I
Treasurer In the election of IS!* I*.1 *. Is lined I
up for the second Democratic appoint- '
nient. Joseph O'Connor, principal of tt c '
Mission H'.trh School, is said to have
withdrawn from the debt, as he would j
not aceÂ«:it the short term In oHlce and i
would accept none at all unit â¢â â¢.-â¢ he should :
also be given a guarantee that he would '
be reinstated in his present It lon upon i
the expiration of his ortlce.
Mayer Phelan was obliged Â»o forego his |
trip to Los Angeles by reason ct the -â¢ : i- i
oui illne.-js of his mother. Mrs. James ]
Pholan. who â - Mid to have been it j
death's door these last few days from a
Middrnly Â«!< veloped congestion of *he
lungs. During her illness the Mayor has
neglected all political matters and given ;
her his undivided attention.
It is r.ot >et announced whether or not
the banquet he was to tendir the new
Board of Supervisors tn-nighÂ« has been
postponed. However, If the Improved con
dition of Mrs. Phelan's health which was
noted yesterday afternoon continues to- !
day there will probably be no alteration i
of the original plan. Although th.> board !
has not yet fixed a day for caucus it will â¢
meet with the Mayor on next Tuesday i
night to discuss a plan of organization i
and any otlier matters that may present i
themselves, including the much-fought- '
for rhairmnnshlp of the Finance i om- i
niHtee. j
DRYDOCK TO BE BUILT
FOR THE LARGEST SHIPS
! EXTENSIVE IMPROVEMENTS AT
HUNTERS POINT.
New Dock Will Be One of the Largest
in the Country and Will Be Con
structed in Solid Rock.
One of the largest drydocks ever built
I in the United States Is soon to be con
structed by the California Drydock Com
pany at Hunters Point. Some time ago
, the company became aware that Its old
! drydock was inadequate to accommodate
modern shipping and determined to en
large the present structure Bngtn >er
Holmes of the Harbor Commissioners
was called Into consultation and after
pome investigation reported that tiie
i proposition to enlarge th.- old dock was
j Impracticable and recommended that the
most feasible plan was to construct an
! entirely now and separate drydock
His suggestions met with the company's
; favor and he was Instructed to proceed
I with the surveys and prepare plans. Mr.
Holmes completed his surveys a few days
. ago and '.s now at work oti the plat:B.
The dock 1? to be 780 feet long, 80 feet
wide at the bottom and 120 feet w!d<j at
the top. It will have 2S feet of water
over the hills at low tide. It will be
1 si Igh 1 1 y I:\ rcer than the (iurk ut the â --
| ton navy-yard; which is said to be one
of the largest and best In the United
States. The new Hunters Point drydo.'k
will be designed with the Idea In v>\v
of accommodating any vessel that enter*
tho harbor of San Francisco.
It is estimated that It will cost between
J500.tÂ».K) and J7M.GX) and work will be com
menced on It as soon as the plane sire
I completed and approved by the stork
i holders of the drydock company. The
outlay will be comparatively small o.v
i Ing to the natural advantages of the pite
i chosen. The basin will bo built In the
; solid rock south of th.- old drydock. This
â¢ rock. Mr. Holmes s;iys. is of peculiar fnr-
I matlon, being extremely soft and yet lin
! pervious to the action of water. The
masonry v.ork will be built over the nat
ural rock basin, making the dock as sub
stantial and solid as possible.

MORRIS' NARROW ESCAPE.
Falls From a Bridge Into Seven Feet
of Water.
SAN RAFAEL, Dec 1â Jame* Morris.
a clerk In a well known San Francis.
mercantile establishment, very nearly met
death yesterday under circumstances that
would have rendered his fate doubly hard
for his relatives to bear. Young Morris
almost drowned while his brother stood
tifty feet away, blissfully unconscious
that danger was near one of the family,
and it was only by the veriest good for
tune that be became aware of the fact in
-time to- render mMHlful^apslKJmvees â
The young man who is no thankful to
day that he is still In the land of the liv
ing is only i;< years old. He came to this
city yesterday to vi*it his brother. W. L.
Morris, and at the time of the accident
the two were walking Into town from
Bchuetaen Park, where they had been
gathering mushrooms. The eider brother
was a few yards In the lead us they pro
ceeded along the railway track, and upon
addressing a question to his relative and
receiving no answer turned round to see
what was the matter.
Young James was nowhere in sight,
though the two had stood in open terri
tory and been In conversation a minute
previously. While Morris was wondering
what had become of his brother the train
thundered by and immediately visions of
hi* brother being killed flashed across hi*
mind. Rushing back along the track he
frantically called the boy's name, but re
ceived no response. Reaching a cattle
guard he perceived the youth flouting un
derneath in the water. It was the work
â¢â I a few minutes only to drug him out
unconscious. Ho recovered his senses In
a short while and was able to relate what
had happened.
Turning round on hiring the whistle
of the train he had stepped through thÂ©
cattle guard bars and struck his head
heavily on a beam In falling. The blow
rendered him insensible and stopped res
plratlon otherwise he woui.l have
drowned in the seven feot of water under
neath the rails like â  rat in â  tran. An It
was the delay of a few minutes would
brought d e^ Ilfe - Younff clothing and
brought to town, given dry clothing and
a nÂ° Â«cÂ« c of brandy, and this morning felt
well enough to return home.

THJE CAT ESCAPED.
NOVATO, Dec. I.â Francis Pelky. a
young son of Thomas Pelky of Klondike
fame. Is now a firm believer In the theory
that a cat has nine lives, and it would
take a Rood argument to convince him to
the contrary. The boy tried to kill one
of the feline tribe yesterday while the
animal was suffering from a fit. and In
stead of accomplishing what seemed a
: pimple enough deeil sent v. bullet through
, bis own foot and Inflicted a bad wound.
The antics of the poor cat and Its evi
dent pain touched the young man's heart
, and he procured a. rifle with which to end
Its agony. He leveled the rifle at the oat
| and was In the act of pulling the trigger
when the cat gave a spasmodic leap and
I struck the end of the barrel In time to
' depress It sufficiently to send a bullet
Plowing through Pelky's left foot. The
boy. dropped the gun and gave a cry of
pain, which brought friends to his asslst
ance. Dr. Kuser was . summoned and
thinks he can save the foot from ampin i
tlon. though the great toe may have to
be lopped off.
Hardly had the rifle exploded when the
cat recovered from Its fit and took a beÂ©
line for another part of town. It baa not
been seen since tho accent. . â¢
ARCHITECTS'
FEES VETOED
BY THE MAYOR
Plans for New Hos
pital Involved.
The Mayor yesterday sent a veto to the
Board of Supervisors which may Bertously
affect the holding of the bond election
with regard to the proposition of building
n new t'ity and County Hospital. He re
turned without approval Urn resolution
allowing Martens &: Coffey and Mooâ r &
architects for the new building,
whose plans wen accepted, "the usual
it;,,! CMtOWlrl fee allowed to architects
upon acceptance of their plans." This ac
tion qn the part of the Mayor may cause
the urchitects to withdraw their plan*,
and the time will tx> too Â»li< >rt to allow the
adoption of new plans.
The Mayor ODjCCtI M the passage <-f the
resolution nrst on the ground that no
amount is spe< i â 
"The architects,',' he says In his veto,
"stated In open board that they would
accept 1 per cent on the estimated cost of
the building a.- a preliminary fee. which
would amount to MHO, When plans were
Invited it was Mated that the architects
should receive .'â  per cent of the cost of the
building, to be paid out of the proceeds
of the bonds Issued or as may hereinafter
be determined by the board. The alter
native was given to the board because
when some twenty plans were submitted
In March. UM, It was discovered that the
board had no power to construct the hos
pital out of the proceed* of taxation nor
could it levy a tax for the purpose. The
plans were never opened, but the archi
tects claimed remuneration from the city,
and they were paid the Hum of $"> Â»i, with
the understanding that the plans should
be at the disposal of the city at any time
called for." The Mayor .says further:
"When the advertisement for plans was
made this year the estimated cost was In
creased from $300,000 tw ' 10.000, yet most
of the old plans, with slight modifications,
were re*ubmitted. Including those of Mar
tens & Coffer. As the time allowed was
necessarily short, it was expected by the
board that the old plans would be pre
sented and that an award would then be
made. The architects have therefor- been
In part compensated and they were asked
to abide by the decision of the people nt
the special election to be held on Decem
ber 2'j and receive their full compensation
In rood season out of the proceeds of the
bonds, provided the buildings were con
structed. If new competitors Insisted on
payment in advance the advertisement
was so worded as to give the board dis
cretion. No such demand was made.
"'I think, therefore, that Martens & Cof
fey and Mooasr & Son, whose resubmitted
plans have been accepted, should not be
now paid any sum further on account. I
also object to the payment at this time on
the ground that no money was appro
priated In the tax levy for that purpose
and no funds are now available. The ar
chitects should be satisfied with having
had their plans adopted and should now
await the decision of the people before re
ceiving further compensation."

VIGOROUS OLD AGE.
Mr. J. B. Potter, Centreville, R. L,
80 years old, writes, Sept. 15, 1899,
of PAINE'S
Celery Compound:
"Fifteen years ago I had to give up
business on account of very poor health. I
was suffering from a number of old chronic
diseases and had complete nervous prostra-
tion. In 1891 I commenced taking Paine's
Celery Compound and soon found that I was
getting the better of my complaints. I con-
tinued using it until I was restored to good
health. Believing that an ounce of prevention
is worth a pound of cure, I take the Com-
pound in the spring and fall, and it keeps me
well. Patne's Celery Compound has made
almost a new man of me, and I have gained
twenty-eight pounds of good, solid flesh and
blood, thanks to its use."
Strong:, vigorous nerves keep the stomach, liver
and kidnevs active. The ills of old age caused by
the breaking down of th se great nerve centres are
prevented by Paine's Celery Compound.

MISSING FRENNA CASE
WITNESS BROUGHT HERE
MESSENGER BOY WILLIE WALSH.
WILLIE WALSH, the messenger boy who Is wanted as a witness !n
the Frenna murder case, arrived In this city from San Bernardino
last night and Is confined In the Broadway Jail. Walsh Is 17 years
d age and claims to have seen the pistol In Frcnna's hand before
any shots were fired on the day of the murder. He left San Francisco about
September 2*. An effort was made by the attorneys in the case to subpÂ«na
him, but without success. He was located In the Jail at San Bernardino a
few* days ago. where he was serving a term for vagrancy.
Walsh was Interviewed last night by Detective Dillon. He says that he
was coming downstairs In the Mills building after having delivered a message
on the ninth floor, when he met Frenr.a. with a pistol In his hand, on the
third floor. The messenger boy claims that he was so frightened at the sight
of the weapon ho rushed up the stairs again and did not stop until he reached
the ninth floor. â¢ '-:
Ha says he did not see Turner and saw no shot fired. The first report he
heard sounded after he bad started up the stairs.
Walsh lives at 644 Jersey street. He Bays he left home because he had
been discharged by the telephone company for overcharging a patron He
was employed by a grocer In Woodland and later came to San Bernardino,
where he was found by a constable under a barn and arrested as a va
grant. Walsh evidently heard some conversation between Frenna and Turner,
but seems very reticent about speaking before he is put upon the witness
stand He claims that he heard angry voices before he reached the third
landing.

COURT-MARTIAL
CONVENED FOR
SHIELDS' TRIAL
Counsel Assigned the
Accused Chaplain.
LIEUT. ELTINGE WILL DEFEND
FORTY-NINTH TO BREAK UP
THIS MORNING.
Two Battalions of the Colored Men to
Sail on the Warren and the
Third Tuesday on the
Sherman,
The trial of Chaplain Shields, charged
with Intemperance, opened before the
court-martial ordered for yesterday morn-
Ing, but It got little further than
the mere opening. Colonel Freeman,
president of the court, had not returned
from Los Angeles, so Major Harvey pre
sided. It was found the accused bad not
secured counsel, and the Judge advocate.
Major Groesbeck, asked that the court
adjourn until Monday morning, when the
trial could proceed. In speaking for the
adjournment, Major Greenback suggested
that counsel be assigned to the accused,
and after some consultation the court 11
rected First Lieutenant Ei tinge of the
Sixth Cavalry to take charge of the de
fense.
On Monday all the officers of the court
I will be present and both sides of the case
â  will be ready to go on. The charges and
! specifications will be read to the accused
and he will plead to them. It Is not ex
pected that the trial Will be a long one.
The Forty-ninth Infantry will break up
i this morning. ' Two battalions will march
. down to the transport dock and will em
bark on the Warren, which will sail in
the afternoon. The third battalion will
sail on the Sherman next Tuesday. The
headquarters .1 band will also go nn
the \\ arren and the Sherman will partial
ly fill up her berth space with I*o recruits
' In addition to the four companies of the
Forty-ninth.
The regiment spent its last day together
In matters of discipline. One of Its men.
Private Hall, was on trial for murder,
he being accused of killing a comrade in
a drunken row in a saloon in Jefferson
j Barracks lust before the regiment started
! out for this coast. There were several
' minor cases also before the court.
Captain Patrick of the Forty-nfth and
Captain Wlggln of the Forty-fourth will
fit on the Sherman with the recruits,
, They are officers wno were detained after
I their regiments sailed to allow of their
examination before a board of inquiry.
I They were found capable of the duties of
j their rank and so were ordered on to the
} islands. There were others not so lucky,
however. Lieutenant Castle and Lieuten
ant Jones of the Forty-fifth, Lieutenant
Drown of the Forty-fourth and Captain
Paul B. Lino of the Thirty-eighth failed
to secure the recommendation of the
board, and so their military career will
be cut short. They will not be allowed
to rejoin their regiments, but will bÂ« mus
i tered out.
The stockshlp Centennial will sail Tues
day In company with the Sherman. She
will carry a full load of mules and their
j equipment.
Troop X of the Sixth Cavalry returned
to the Presidio yesterday, weary a: very
i willing to rest. The troop has been for
several months on guard duty at Yosem-
Ite Park, but the winter's approach drove
the men out and they marched from the
i park home. There were fifty-one troop
ers in the guard, under command of Cap
tain Wllcox. They started from the park
November. 13 and met all the hard weather
there has been since then. Frequent stops
had to be made to dig out wagons that
had become mired in the soft roads. The
men return .well and rugged, however,
for though the work is hard it is all out
In the air, and it is not the kind that does
men harm.
Lieutenant ITarbeson of the Twelfth In
fantry and Lieutenant Leopold Thun of
i the Forty-sixth Infantry will sail on the
! Sherman to Join their regiments in the
; islands. Lieutenant Thun Is the Austrian
Count who was commissioned an otficer
I of the United States army out of courtesy
! to his Government, who wished him to
j represent it.
I The band of the Forty-ninth Infantry
( gave a farewell concert yesterday after
j noon which partook of the nature of a
serenade to Mrs. Ducat, wire of the lieu
j tenant colonel of the Forty-ninth.
Lieutenant Frank C. liurnett of the
Thirty-ninth Infantry reported for duty
at the Presidio yesterday. He was as
signed to the recruits.
ORDER PUZZLING TO
OIL LAND LOCATORS
WILL PROBABLY HASTEN THE
BORING OF WELLS.
Many oil men In this city are much in
terested. Some days ago mention was
made In a telegraphic dispatch that the
Secretary of the Interior had made a rul
ing to the following effect: "In order to
prove that the land is valuable as petro
leum producing land a well must be bored
and surface indications are not to count
as evidences of oil in paying quantities."
There are several hundred oil companies
in this vicinity that have been incorpor
ated during the past year. Some of them
have taken up Government land. Many
others have secured land by patent; oth
ers by lease for a term of years, paying a
royalty to the owner; others still axe un
der the placer mining law. which was
amended Ur include oil iaittis soma years
ago. Several classes of these oil men
have little if any interest in the decision
alluded to. But there are others who are
much concerned. Inquiries have been
made at the United States Land Oflic*
in this city for a copy of the decision, but
MMM has arrived yet.
On the face of the decision it teems to
say that the surface geological evidences
of oil are not sutnclent. When. then. It
Is asked by the locators, must the well
alluded to be bored to get a title from the
Government? No one here knows. in the
past few months there have teen several
Instances of claim-Jumping in the new oil
district. dome speculators think that the
present condition of uncertainty may In
crease the "jumping." Perhaps this first
man or company who gets a well in op
eration In the lands which have been
taken up solely upon tho surface indica
tions may be found eventually in posses
sion of the land, although others may
have been thÂ« first to tile. This consid
eration, In the opinion of some parties In
terested in the oil situation, will hasten
the development of the whole oil district.
An outfit to bore 1000 feet, with the
tubing necessary, costs about $7000 laid
down in California. Under the placer
mining law twenty acres can be riled upon
by any citizen. Eight persons can rllo
upon ICO acres, and the advantage of this
plan has been that It was necessary to do
only |1O) worth of work per annum to
ultimately prove up on the land and get
the title from tho Government. The time
for completing the transaction extends
over a period of years.
Copies of the decision of the Secretary
of the Interior have been sent for by oil
men. There is an opinion generally enter
tained that Judge Rom may take this
phase of the oil matter Into consideration
in rendering his decision next week on
the Home Oil Company rase at Los An
geles. _

VII. VISITING AND ENTER
TAINING.
I sometimes wonder If organized phil
anthropy and hotels are not doing awiy
with Individual hospitality. Th- old
fashioned Quaker quarterly meetings
were abundant evidence of the past gen
erous way of crowding, but now it is
often difficult for families with small in
comes to be as hospitable m people were
even thirty years ago. when single bed
rooms were not deemed hygienic necessi
ties.
We do not take to hospitality naturally.
Joyously, Inevitably; we hayÂ»Â» to weign its
pros and cons. We do not dare to Invite
our superiors lest we seem arrogant, so
we get conscientious and ask those whom
we do not want as a matter ol duty. But
when hospitality Is thus branded and
when one Is Invited as to a philanthropic
caravansary scant pleasure is felt by
either visitor or visited.
"Be sure you never put a guest roo-n
to rights till your guest has been pone

appeared, saying she had missed her
train. I suppose I must have shown my
dismay, for she told me she did not ralnd
sleeping in the same sheets one rr rt
night, as it would save washing, and that
she always took her own pillowcase
wherever she went from a labor-saving
regard for her entertainer." Not all vis
itors are as frank, far-seeing and con
Â»sdeiateâthat is, if Mrs. were really
considerate.
It Is not merely the cost of a guest
that has to be reckoned, but also tiie
amount of time she consumes, since the
modern woman does not sit down to talk
and sew. Of course, there are many
kinds of visitors. Those with a hobby
know how to take care of them
provided they do not lay every one else
under contribution to It. There is tne
shopping visitor from the country; let
her hunt for bargains by herself. There
is the aged or lonely relative with nerve*
and feelings and the general utility vis
itor whose services one unconsciously Â«c
cepts. and thÂ«Â» gay young srtri with her
trunk of bewildering vanities, who mikM
ye . happy Just because she Is. and the
celebrity visitor, whom thÂ» papers inter
view. Each one is to be entertained ac
cording to her kind, but on them all rets
the same sense of obligation, since It Is
always an honor to be Invited Into any
body's home life, no matter how sirrple
the home.
A guest from tne moment of her arrival
till that of her departure should know
when to kpeck and when not to sptik.
when to Jo and when not t<Â» 60. when to
?pr.'nr ar<l when to disappear. There are.
moreover, two or three misdemeanors
which visitors of high breeding nev*r
commitâ such as for-- platonlc frlcnl
ships with one's host or hostess when
staving Act their roof. receiving from
or making offers of marriage to members
of the family, indulging In lengthy moon
light flirtations on piazza* or parlor <Â»â *
a-tetes, gaping when one Is bored or Im
posing upon or Ignoring servarts and for
getting to compensate them for special
personal service, and lastly, the ml?Â«>
meanor of tetng unpunctual. Little awk
wardneÂ«s3s are to be avoided and ex
planations are always disastrous. Atwre
all, the well-bred guest, after a visit Is
ended, never gossips about the amusing
weaknesses of the family In which she
has been either a welcomed or tolerated
visitor.
Of course, a hostess Is responsible f">r
the good times of her visitors an" must
not calculate on leaving them alone too
severely, as each one likes to f**el she
is of some consequence. In olden days a
visitor shared the family life, Its Joys,
economies and WOrt To-day her hos
tess miv greet her on her arrival and not
?ee her again till 5 o'clock tea or late din
ner, and whether or not they may meet
more than casually at the breakfast table
depends upon the peripatetic ability of
the hostess for clubs and committee
work. It Is much plea*.. Ito visit in
and much easier to entertain In a large
family where there are children, who
transform the house Into a variety show.
than In a home where the hostess Is by
herself, for a family nursery or grown-up
children make the delight of a visit.
On a visitor in any kind of a home,
wealthy, medium or economical, always
rests the Invariable task of making her
self agreeable, so perpetual a bondage
that many persons prefer the Independ
ence of a hotel to being on steady family
dress parade. Just be natural, say the
guidebooks anent visiting. All very well
If that means being always charming and
never aggressive, no matter how old and
privileged nor bow youthful and de
bonair one may be. Yet too often being
natural means being rude and selfish.
Said a polished hostess of a yoeng girl:
"She had so many resources within her
self and she was interested in so many
things that she was a delightful visitor;
she enlivened us when we were together,
and she was never a weight on our minds
when she was alone." And another l^idy
remarked of her visitor: "He was so
thoughtful of my comfort, so sunny In his
greeting, that I knew I needed him ail
the time."
Personality and point of view enter In
to the mutual relationship of visitor and
ThÂ«rÂ« Is as little sense in setting
â hotdfl ajar by friction of unassimll
atlng guests as there Is In being so ex
clusive that no one in\"ites anybody to
stay over ntght. Some people take apart
ments Just to condone their mental lack
-ptiality. It Is often said that the
West, is ny-re easily hospitable than the
East. It is If emphasis be laid on the ad
verb in making such a statement. Still,
throughout the country, if summer houso
parties and their like are expected, mod
ern conventional demands, public duties
and troubles with domestics have less
ened that ready, easy hospitality which
did not mind letting Its affairs b* known.
When summer comes, fortunately, we
relax our housekeeping rigidity and con
sent to fill our cottages with guests and
to drive three in a bupgy.
One very noticeable change tn the meth
ods of hospitality is the extent to which
Sunday has become a gala day. Unex
pected guests are expected to constantly
I . in tn lunch or dinner: girls are at
home in the afternoon to young oien ca>i
ers; musicales are In order in the even
:r I
8:111. all this Is different from thi dear
bygone way of making visits, when one
became part of the family and shared
Its joys and sorrows. Such familiarity
has gone jut with hand-sewing and let
ter-writing, and we now entertain instead
of having visitors.
In entertaining, the first encounter with
difficulty lies in making out "the list."
That conquered, th* menu steps into Its
prescribed place with the nv<le of enter
tnlnment. but "the list"? The people to
whom one owes a return Invitation; the
people whom It pays socially to tnrlte.
the people whom one must Invite, tnt!
mat* friends, relatives, etc.; thos* whom
no one wants but who will feÂ»l s'lghted
11 not asked. Only a huge reception can
Include them nil. and then If all come the
grcgarlousnesa cf the affair â poUl II all.
The reception In the form of a cru*h at an
aftÂ«?rmon tea. th* most Inclusive nnd thÂ«
cheapest way of er.tertalnlr.fr. Is deserv
edly popular, but It 1Â» nnt elegant, for no
personal compliment Is conveyed by being
in\-ltcd to It. though If one Is omitted
there is legitimate cauÂ«e for personal
grievance. Urea If a hostess could bÂ« iurÂ«
of carrying out a progressive social series
of u&s. offense is often taken at not
having been summoned at the *ame tltna
when some one else was bidden, and so
she has recourse to naming several days
on the wrne card, trusting to the law of
averages to distribute her friend* lmpÂ«r
tonally.
Oh, the folly of It . -I! When It Is only
l a matt-r uf personal Independence- which
j can be sheathed in grace. Why not dare
! to Invite at different times those whom
â  one wishes, and then make each one feet
shÂ« is especially desired? Practically this
Is done at dinner parties and lunches. thÂ«
dinner party being the most rigorous la
etiquette, the most complimentary In form
to a guest and the most disturbing of so
cial forces to the average American
household. But of all social absurdities
the notion that the essence of honor to
a guest lies in the expense of a dinner Is
the most unflattering .o. the dignity of
human nature, it Is the ;^opie whoa
one meets, not the menu, neither the flow.
cr 3 nor the service that makes the charm
or a dinner.
T So back We are driven to "th- "*â¢"
Just because most persona do not know
, now to be brilliant In general conversa
, ucn are most dinner parties stupid, while
a dinner of tete-a-tetes is abominably bad
manners. A hostes3 should always piaa
0 seat her gut-* Â«o that there will bÂ«
two or three etarters of general talk. Do
not put a monoiogist where he can com
rnacd attenUon. Quench h!m between
two gossips. Do not avoid earnestness.
; even seriousness, but know when to re
liuve It by anecdote, graceful and sliding
changes of conversational base, us it is
ominous of trouble to swerve off from a
1 topic abruptly. Each guest must fee) a
; personal responsibility for the good times
of others, Lot so much by shining herself
as by drawing oat others.
Thf *ecrÂ«t of success in entertainicr lie*
in this rower over others. A certain Bos
ton husband and wife were much sought
i for at dinners because where they were
I alt *-r.t delightfully : only a few knew
that the couple deliberately planned at
tack ar.d resistance In talk, for of cours*
| married people are always placed at op
i pos.te ends of a table. The fashion of
dinner parties for "bud." is amusing
since buds* and college lads do not know
bow to talk. Early middle age. say 2S â¢â ,
soon enough to begin as a dinner de
butante. uc^
Why raw oysters, soup, fish etc.
.should follow each other with gastron
omic Inflexibility is again amusing it
I would be a relief to have baked bean. a.
an entree rather than a vol-au-vent. out
, whether the dinners be Utue and Li
; formal or tig and formal the one Inrt!*-
Pe -ests rCqUiÃlte ls that of *Â«Â«-MlÂ«cted
Leisure is another Ingredient In enter
| tainment which not even rich people no*
, Bess If they are philanthropic. It takes
i up time to have a succession of small &%.
UTltles. whether balls, dinners, lunches
j or teas, and yet to acquire fame as an
entertainer one must be constantly at it
on a limited scale, as far as nimb-r of
I guests Is concerned. Disagreeable as !s
the cant phrase "small and select" It tx
! presses Just what is necessary for ele
gance and Intellectual pleasure. The
t habit of mere lionizing is noxious to both
! the h*ro and his clientele. Emerson
! avoided being a lion, whereas Dr. Holmes
I took it kindly and facetiously. Lowell tt
i garded such servility as a passing show
I and Whlttler negatived It Indefinitely.
â¢ Why must one always be invited to meet
â¢ somebody? Why cannot we go into so
i clety to meet ourselves. Just as we do at
| clubs, church sociables and young peo
! pie's associations, where we are always
I sure of having a good time a- equals)?
If. however, we are bent on lionizing
then we must remember that shaking
hands with an unknown crowd does not
! convey the same sense of adulation to
| the distinguished guest as when a greater
person than one's self la humbly pre
sented.
A third requisite In skillful entertaining
lies In this very matter of Introductions.
j Not merely to pronounew the name, but
to give some clew as to who la who- to
| linger an appreciable second, thai as
hostess one may be sure that the tÂ»o

It comes that It Is a fallacy to suppose
brilliancy rather than sympathy and

Bradstreet's Financial Review. !
NT3W TOHK. Dee. 1.-nradstreefs financial
review "-morrow will ray:
Money continues to be a pre-eminent factor
In determining the character anil tendency of
current peculation In securities at New Tork.
'Die tavoratle batik statement which appeared
lust Saturday, when the Stock Exchange had
adjourned out of respect to the memory of
the late Vice President Hobart. however, had
been expected and In part discounted l>y the
strength of prices during the final days of
last week. The fact that some money hod re
turned from the West and that the rÂ»-e*tnr>
11-hment of a $6,000,000 nut-plus over the legal
requirement of the banks in place of the
deficit in reserves shown by the two preceding
weekly statements was not entirely due to
l>urchnws of government bondi by the treas
ury had a favorable effect on sentiment
Nevertheless, when the market reopened on
Monday It . bwam* apparent not only that
speculative Interests which had been support-
Ing prices were Inclined to realize on the de
velopment of any public demand for stocks
but that while stringency In the loan market
win Improbable there was still no likelihood
of a return to easy monetary conditions. While
money Is beginning to return to New fork
from the West the South In drawlnc conKld-r
bbw amounts and it was a!*. noted that for
eign exchanges advanced In a way which cave
rupport to the Idea that sold mlrht be shipped
to London. This tendency was checked by
the renewed and somewhat, unexpected firm
ness of call loan rates, which were only tem
porarily below 6 per cent and particularly on
Tuesday were ns high as 8 pÂ«r cent. The turn-
Ing In of some fairly large blocks of Kovern
ment bonds at the treasury on Wednesday and
the extension of Secretary Gage's offer so that
the $7,000,000 more of bonds the treasury had
not obtained out of the $25,000,000 will be taken
prior to December 13, had. however, a coo.l
effect on the tore of the money market and
arrested any expectation that rates would . be
allowed to rea> h a higher level than Is needed
M act as a preventive of irold exports. On
I'rlil.v. when the market reopened after the
Thanksgiving holiday, with on advance in the
Bank of England rate In the meantime ex
change was firm and money was held nt 6 per
cent, a further disinclination for speculative
activity being apparent. The action of money
â wan therefore not favorable to bullish activity
but th- market found 1% simulant In another
direction. Following the sharp advance In
Baltimore and Ohio securities at the close of
last week there wa* unusual activity In New
lork Central, and more particularly the Penn
sylvania railway stocks The rise of the lat
ter to over 140 was accompanied by reports of
111 agreement between thÂ« two eonpanlrs ju.it
, named regarding the maintenance of rates and
1 the division of territory where their competi
tion Is likely to lead to disagreements. ThÂ»s
view of tha matter wa s naturally made thÂ»
basis for more elaborate rumors denllng with
the possibility of closer relations between all
the trunk lines, while one nt.ry which found
Its way Into print was that the Pennsylvania
had acquired a controlling Interest In the Ual
tlmore and Ohio and that a deal had been con
summated by which the VnnderbiU party ao
gulrrd a majority of the ntocks of the U!ff
Four and the Chesapeake and Ohio roads for
the purpn-e of connoll.lntln* these latter two.
The reported acquisitions were denied with con
siderable emphasis, but not before Baltimore
and Ohio stocks, which had at first reacted.
j rn*tle new price record*, the common rising to

Bradstreet's on Trade.
NEW TORK. Dec. I.â Bradstreet's to-morrow
will say: Warm weather and a holiday have
Imparted an appearance of Irregularity and
even dullness to some lines of distributive
trade, completing a month which has been on
the whole quieter than was the preceding
month, but one which still makes satisfactory
comparison with M corresponding period a year
ago. when the Weather conditions particularly
favored distribution. The price situation gen
erally is apparently one of notable strength, in
; view of the* conditions. Farm products. It la
\ true, notably wheat an.l corn, have been weak
and lower un unsatisfactory foreign demand
and a bearish influence exercised by increasing
piles of the former grain. Other cereals are
stronger, however. Provision* have been lower,
largely on Increased receipts â¢>: hogs, but lard
has been steady on good export demand. Wool
en go â :* have been strong, also, despite unfa
vorable weather, Raw wool has again ad
vanced on heavy trading, and what is addi
tionally Interesting, rice* at the latest London
wool ttnlS appear to have gained to a parity
with recent advance* here.
Crop damage reports from Brazil have been
a moving feature In coffee, which started from
I a very low price level anil with large stocks
I carried over from previous years. The price
of this (.tuple advanced nearly one cent In
; November. Iron and bteel are even quieter
! than they were a week ago, and some shading
I of prices, Bora In the nature Of readjustment.
I however, than of weakness, have xiven an
I appearance of Irregularity to the market, and
the feature of the week lias been the agree
ment upon Iron ore prices, placing the price
for the cumins season, as was Intimated In
this column laÂ«st week, at nearly double that
paid at the opening of the present year. <)thÂ»r
metal* have been fairly steady In sympathy
with London, A marked tendency toward
higher prices for hardware is reported at a
number of. markets. Holiday business in this
line baa opened well, and the proa] set for
spring trade 1a regarded as encouraging. Coal
remains strong In price, the chief difficulty, as
heretofore. bving question* of transportalon.
The Industrial situation ha* improved. Some
further advances In wages of railway people
and of laworkers are to be noted, and some
strikes of coal miners have been settled.

week aggregate 3.639.400 bu'hels. against 3,6>3,

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO. Dec. I.â At thÂ« cpening to-day
the wheat market derived a bit of steadiness
from the light deliveries of the contra-t ar

Minneapolis and reported damages fr >m flies
In Michigan. May opened a shade over
Wednesday at 69V ( j63 t Â». and Mr y touched 70c.
Business was stagnant and the markÂ»t turned
speedily weaJc upon the receipt of a discourag
ing Modern Miller report and the lack of cut
side demand. The flour trade was reported
anything but satisfactory, the weather good
for fall plant-i and crops and thÂ» frost said to
have killed the Hessian fly. The slump thuÂ«
started was boosted al.n;; as many stop orders
were touched, thus putting considerable long
wheat on the market. May nagged down t.)

while suiter fcr her hand had built In the

promptly cenfesied that her mother had

BOSCOWS DIVORCED.
Granting of the Deere* Recalls Spicy
Stories of Their Differences.
OAKLAND, Dec. I.â A decree of divorce
was granted oy Superior Judge Ellsworth
late this afternoon In the suit of William
A. Boscow against his wife. Amelia A.
Boscow, brought on the ground of ex
trome cruelty. The custody of the three
childrenâ Pearl. < trace and Ethel, aged 12
9 and 6 years respectivelyâ is awarded
to the defendant until the further order
of the court, and Mr. Boscow is directed
to pay her $9 a week for their mainte
nance and support.
The domestic troubles of the lioscows
date back only a few months, at a time
when Dr. H. Anderson occupied rooms
at their residence In East Oakland.
Rumors floated about Mr. Moscow's ears
to the effect that his wife had become
i enamored of their star boarder. As a
result the husband complained bitterly
to his wife. A controversy followed, and
the wife threatened to sue for divorce
However, Dr. Anderson quitted his rooms
, and moved to another part of town. Bos
cow, who is manager of the Excelsior
, Redwood Company, afterward created a
mild sensation by declaring openly that
his wife was under the hypnotic influ
ence exercised by Dr. Anderson, who later
1 was arrested on a charge of practicing
', medicine without a license. At tho doe
' tor's trial It developed that the only
medical treatment he had ever extended
' to Mr. Boacow was once when the latter
was very ill the doctor had bathed his
enemy's : feet. Shortly after the contro
versy the Boscows kissed and made up
but their happiness wan brief, and soon
the husband filed the divorce suit
Schmidt's Second Trial.
OAKLAND, Dec. I.â The second trial of
Jncob O. Schmidt, charged with an ns
eault with a deadly weapon In threaten
ing to shoot his mother-in-law. Mrs H
M. Meinert, at her home in East Oak
land last September, was commenced to
day before a Jury In Judge Hall's court.
At the former triaJ the Jury diaa*n-eed.
REAL ESTATE MARKET QUIET
FOOTBALL games and turkey dln
n. r* received rather mor.e attention
from the public during the pant
w^ek than real estate transactions,
but this was to be expected, and
the broken are more than satisfied
with the situation. No exceptionally
large Bales have \<>-<n reported during the
closing week of November, and those best
informed on the subject say that no large
Bales should bu looked fyr now until after
the holidays. This is of course by no
means a prophecy and the prediction may
)>e upset before the end of the coming
week, as it is known that MTenU big
deals are being negotiated and arc liable
to be consummated any day. Still the
market is usually quiet during the holi
day period and there appears to be no
special reuaon why an exception should
be noted this year.

The next largest was that of the estate
of Alfred T. Moss with C. If. Depew for
two separate dwellings, each of two
stories and attic, on the west line of Sev
enth avenue, BE feet north of Lake street,
for $4300. ' Joseph Goetz contracted with

contracts of the week ranged in value
from $1142 to $2570.
Savings banks, building associations and
private capitalists loaned an aggregate of
1156,935 on local real estate security dur
ing the week ending November 25. The
total amount loaned for. the previous week
was 1622,000. The savings banks last week
loaned a total of $12'J,i'.50. as follows: Hl
bernla. $54,500: German. $24,700: San Fran
cisco Bavinn Union. $2250: Savings and
Loan, $2000; Humboldt. $15,200. and Mutual,
ROM. The loans of the building associa
tions amounted to $25*."> and those of pri
vate capitalists and others were $24,785.
The bulk of the money put out by the
savings banks last week was at 6 per cent.
The Hlbernla made one loan of $23,000. No
other loan exceeded 18000. Business for
the week was quite light. Releases were
$155,275, or practically the same amount
as loaned out, so there was little new
money lodged against this form of se
curity.

It wus whispered in Berkeley that
W nipple would play whether the facult>
wished It or not. Wherever a party of
htu<lt-:its collected Professor Edwards was
condemned fcr his Interference, which the
football enthusiasts claimed was uncalled
for and unseemly. W hippie wished har
mony and did nothing to provoke the pro
fessorial wrath, resting quietly and
nxvaitlng the ultimate turn or things. It
Is 6aid that at a faculty committee meet
ing the president of the university was
called in and when asked advice on the
muitÂ«-r said some strong things about a
too close observance of a law that was
palpably Unjust and ridiculous from a
practical point of view. At any rate, all
the college nun assert that Whlpple has
ftrong support from the president.
A t<mall-*i7.ed riot will break out at the
university If Whlpple Is suspended on ac
count of his playing with the team. The
students are t-trong in their opposition to
Colonel Edwards, and show no hesitation
in expressing it. When the team Jumped
on to the field 'Thursday afternoon a cry
went up from the bleachers that showed
plainly the attitude of the student body.
â¢We want Whlpple! we want Whlpple!"
floated over the gridiron, to the annoy
ance of the faculty committee. But this
wa* not all. At the banquet held at Del
menico's Thursday night the name of
Colonel Edwards was mentioned, and the
team rose up in a body, and for a time It
looked as if some "rough house" would
result.
The faculty athletic committee will
consider Whlpple's case next week. The
students anticipate the worst If the strict
letter of faculty law in observed. Many
Interesting things are promised over the
entanglement, and President Wheeler may
be called in to make order cut of the con
fusion.
j young fish In Fmall-mesh nets. In taking
the shrimps tons of small flsh have been
destroyed. All fishes not large enough to
soil were dried and converted Into a fer
tilizer, which was Bent to China. As a
result bay fishing has become very poor
for anglers fur years past.
The Chinese, however, risked arrest and
I fines to continue the business, and dozens
I have been caught and heavily punished.
| The loss did not fall upon the actual nsh
ers. but^upon the wealthy Chinese for
whom they were working. The latter
stood the strain for a time, and at last
dtvlsed a scheme evidently looking to
ward Intimidating the deputies of the
commission. From what can be learned.
King Owyang, ex-Vice Consul, endeav
ored . to drive one of the â¢â¢tongs" out of
the shrimp-fishing business unless It sold
all of its product or a part of It to his
compuny. To accomplish this, he stated
j that unless the rivals agreed to his terms
! the deputies of the State Commission
would never allow them to do any more
fishing. The threat had some effect, for
;i part of the tone threatened sold out to
Dun.
Had the matter ended there the outside
; world would have known nothing about
; the trouble among the Chinese; but it
happened that the very fishermen who ex
pected protection were soon after arrested
r y H e P '.)â¢ John Davis, who was assisted
P y Pl> of>sÂ»or .Scot, eld and Engineer Web
ber. Then a howl went up and King evi
dently saw- that he had to play the game
to the end. An attorney for the Chinese
made charges at the office of the com
mission that reflected discredit upon the
honesty of the deputies. In a letter the
attorney asserted that when King went
to the fish camp on San Pablo Bay to
bulldoze the rival fishermen to selling to
Kings company the latter was accom-
IÂ»anlÂ»-d by Deputy Davis, whose presence
teemed to back up King's assertion. The
Â£?*?. of the alleged Interview was October
J2 (Sunday), and It was said that the two
went to the camp la the Commissioners'
launch.
Until yesterday Davis was up the bay
on the launch and was unaware of the
rhargra made against him. At the office
yesterday he stated that he never was on
i the bay in a launch with the Chinese ex-
Consul and that he never visited that or
any other Chinese ramp with him. On the
day In question (October 29) the launch
*'?%?} i. 1 MS 1 " 00 *** he WUH a his home
nt fcan Pablo, on the opposite side of the
bay from the camp. He has plenty of wit
nesses to nrove the truth of this. On the
next day fie went to Stockton. The Com-
S,rte cr "t have the greatest confidence In
\*>l :^ x l Â°} 'V r - Davls and the rest of
the crew, and there seems to be no fear
that the true Inwardness of the charges
will prove that the Chinese used the
names of the commission's officers to fur
ther their own business Interests.

POLICEMEN KDWARD STAN
TON, popularly known as "Cas
tle Garden." and ErneÃt Alexan
der dispute with each other the
honor of having served as a target
Thanksgiving day for one of the sable
hued privates of the Forty-ninth Vol
unteer Regiment, now encamped at the
l'r.sidio.
Th" naypur chot at me free
i<'lrn. *," hi' explained yesterday morn
ing to Warrant clerk Lyons of Police
Court 2. "ol cud hear th' lidden mis-
Ringers Iv death Kinging 'Oh, Mollle,
oh," as they wint slzzln' pasht me
Th' captln" towld me to git a
warrant and arrlst "im."
" }!.: shot at me, not yo\i." inter
rupted Officer Alexander, who seemed
anxious to put his Hat to the com
plaint.
"Chot nt yir. diddy!" exclaimed
Stanton, his disgust at the other's
claim being emphasized by the rich
ness of the brogue that has earned for
him the nickname he bears. "Chot at
vizâ lnd fy wud he choot at viz? Didn't
th' black divvle butt at me lolke a
billy goat, md didn't Oi flure 'im wf
me fist? Gowan, Illic, yer Joshin'."
Alexander was sincere, however, in hli
claim to the ticklish honor. The con
sequence was that Lyons was com
pelled to listen to a long argument
from each, freely interrupted by the
other, of hit* undeniable right to sign
the complaint. lietween the two he
managed to get the story of nearly a
tragedy turned Into a comedy.
About 10 o'clock Thanksgiving nlpht
Stanton and Alexander, while patrol
ling their beats near the entrance to
the Presidio, heard a disturbance in
the saloon of Al White, curnur of
Greenwich and Lyon streets. Entering
they found a dusky volunteer of the
Forty-ninth staggering under more
than the black mail's sh*xe of the
white man's Thanksgiving burden. He
was muklng enough noise for a regi
ment. The officer* went up to him and
told him he would better go to cujiip.
"Got'ell," shouted the volunteer, as
he bent his head and started full tilt at
the middle of "Castle Garden," with
intent to butt that officer off the map.
Btanton was too fast for him, how
ever, and sidestepping he "landed wan
on th' naygur's p'lnt." Down and al
most out went the soldier, but he loon
recovered and got on his feet. He had
enough apparently for the time being
and made unsteadily for the door.
"You Jes wait a minute," he re
marked as he passed out the door. "I'll
be back an' fix you!"
"All rolght," replied Stanton. never
dreaming he would again sÂ«a the vol
unteer, "we'll wait."

business men of the city to petition the
Governor to call an extra session of the
legislature, and woefully failed In his
efforts. Ostensibly the purpose of the ex
tra session Is the enactment of laws per
mitting much needed improvement* on
the water front, but some of the gentle
man who have a greater Interest In the
advancement of the city and the State
than they have In the election of Dan
Burns as United States Senator saw a
Joker In the memorial and would not
stand for It.
Mr. Kllburn sprang his surprise, at a
meeting of the Harbor Commissioners and
committee* from the North Central Im
provement Association and the Chamber
of. Commerce, called for tha purpose of
and Shoot at Human Targets.
The two officers saw the soldier enter
the Presidio gate as they passed on to
the street and Immediately made up
their minds he would remain in camp.
What was their surprise a few minutes
later when the report of an army rifle
and the "rip" of a bullet close to their
heads warned them that some one was
shooting at them. Knowing their Up
ton they deployed In time to escape
two more bullets. By this time Alex
ander, having unllmbered his Betsy,
fired three shots at the disappearing
figure, in the darkness.
"All coons look alike to mÂ«," said
Alexander as he put up his revolver.
"I don't think Pd be able to recognize
him. Would you" 1 "
"Oi dlnno." Bald Stanton. "D'yis
fink ylz hit 'im?"
"1 think 1 pinked him" replied the
other.
"Thin, be hivins." exclaimed Ptan
ton. "we shud hey no trouble at all, at
all. Pink naygurs are scarce as flte
blackburnls or hlns 1 tathe. He'll be
the' only wan in camp."
Th<- two arms of the civil law walked
on their four feet Into the reservation.
Alexander looking for a trail of blood
find Stanton keeping his eyes open for
a "pink naygur." They failed to find
him. and so reported, along with the
story of the assault, to their captain,
who ordered them to get a "John Doe"
warrant for the arrest of the blood
thirsty unknown.
Warrant Clerk Lyons decided that
Officer Stanton was entitled to the call
and allowed him to swear to a com
plaint charging the unknown negro
with assault to murder. Alexander
still Insists that he. not Stanton. ww
discussing the extension of the wharfoK*
facilities* along the water front and of
arriving nt the best plan to carry the Im
provements Into execution. Matters were
proceeding very satisfactorily, when the
extra session petition .was Introduced,
From that on until the adjournment there i
, was a chill.
Bumming up the entire meeting, there
was nothing tangible accomplished. The
North Central Improvement Association
advanced one plan, the Chamber of Com-
I merce another, while the Harbor Com-
I mission<is favored something almost en
tirely different from either. All three
agreed, however, that If San Francisco
expects to hold her shipping trade and
secure the Increase that rightfully belongs
to her, she must build more wharves and
, increase the capacity of the water front.
It is expected that their different Ideas
as to how to accomplish the desired re
sults may become crystallized , and tha
Improvements be made.
j H. P. Sonntag, who acted as spokesman
for the Improvement Association, stated
that what It wanted was the lengthening
i or the wharves to 800 feet, the completion
of the seawall and the building of the
! belt road. He said that he had heard
that the Governor was going to call an
extra session of the Legislature to elect
a^unlted States Senator, and he suggested
that Gage be requested to embody in l.!s
call the undertaking of the proposed har
bor improvements. Secretary Painter,
Mr. Strauss, E. Scott, T. C. Frledlander
and several others spoke along the same
lines, giving forcible expression to thÂ«
absolute necessity of - something being
done. Their suggestion was that the Leg
;*>lature he asked to submit to the voters
the issuanc: of bonds for the work.
Commissioner Harney said that the
work could be accomplished without rais
ing the funds by bonds, provided certain
amendments were made in the existing
laws. When the discussion reached- this
point Mr. Kill. urn pulled from his pocket
a roll of typewritten documents and dis
tributed them among the visitors, saying
that as the Legislature would have to do |
something before the Harbor Commis- i
sioners could undertake the proposed Im
provements, the proper thing to do would
be to let the Governor know what W9M
wanted. The document he distributed is
printed above. . William Dolbeer of the
Chamber of Commerce said that the In
stitution he represented would not tfve
the Governor an excuse for calling an
extra session to elect Dan Rums undor
the cloak that It was being called for
harbor improvements. Mr. Kllburn be
came somewhat wrathy at*, the opposi
â¢ tion.
"Do you want to say, then," he re
marked, addressing Dolbeer. "that !t
would be a high crime to call an extra
session to elect a Senator, but that If It
Is called you want to perpetuate the
crime by asking the Governor to take up
this question of harbor improvements?
Have you courage enough to say so?
How anxious are you for improvements,
anyhow? Are the Interests of the front
to be secondary to the interests of a few
men who want to prevent v the election of
a Senator?"
There was no reply. Mr. Sonntag said
that if thÂ« Senatorial proposition was em
bodied in the petition no one would sign
It. but that If it was left out and the
water front business substituted v every
one would sign and the Governor would
be free to add the Senatorshlp deal to
his call if he saw fit to do so. He alÂ»o
announced that such a petition was be
ing drawn, by the legal representative of
the Improvement Association together
with a bill covering the harbor matter,
which It was proposed to submit to the
Legislature. '
The Harbor Commissioners' â¢ plan Is â¢to
have the laws changed bo that GOO - feet
thÂ© target. Up to date they have
failed to locate the bloodthirsty pri
vate, who. It Is suspected. Is safe in
the guardhouse on a plain charge of
drunk, from which he will not be freed
until he Is far on the seas on the way
to the Philippines.
The "pink naygur" was arrested last
evening at 426 Pacific Â«Â»treet by Ser
geant Christesen and positively identi
fied by his targets a.s being their man.
He gave the name of Andrew Jackson.
Officer Stanton's "pink naygur" was
not the only private of the Forty
ninth who carried a white man's pack
age Thanksgiving night and exhibited
and shot deadly weapons within the
city. Twoâ John Wyatt and J..hn
Wood, of Company Xâ were before Po
lice Judge Conlan yesterday morning,
the first to answer a charge of carry-
Ing concealed weapons, the second for
discharging firearms. Wood was ar
rested in Chinatown for shooting a re
volver, narrowly missing a passing
Chinawoman and her baby. He said
be ilidn't know the weapon was loaded.
"1 sw'ar to Gawd," Jedge," he said,
lifting his left arm high in the air, "I
didn't know dat gun was loaded; 'deed
I didn't. I hope I nevah take dls arm
down If dat ain't de truth. "
John Wyatt told the court that the
revolver the policeman found on him
was his brother's. He said he had
found that relative, also a private In
:).<â  K<Tiy-nlnth. Intoxicated and quar
relsome in a saloon near the Presidio
and had taken the weupon from him to
prevent bloodshed and had put it
away down his trousers leg out of
sight.
"I didn't want him to disgrace hts-
Bt-lf, Jedge, by killln' nobody an" den
gettln' kick oute.n de regiment foh
whisky. Das why I hud dat gun â
hones', Jedge."
The court said he would decide their
raMs to-day, and they were taken
back to prison.
Private William Ammors. also of
Company X, was arrested at an early
hour yesterday morning in front of the
Hoffman cafe. Just after he had taken
four shots at the moon. He was doing;
a pand Jig and flourishing his revolver,
purrounded by a circle or yelling colle
gians, when Officer John O'Connor
gathered him In. Ammors explained to
Police Judge Graham yesterday that
the weapon was not his and that he
had not discharged It. He said some
of the college boys were Just shooting
a few highballs into the man in the
moon and had handed him the revolver
Just before the officer arrived on the
SV>'!ie.
Judge Graham believed him, but or
dered the police to return him his re
volver and allowed Ammors to depart.
The remainder of the Fortv-nlnth will
get away to-dag nnd Monday for Ma

the board, in Its expenditures, to antici

than one year. It is claimed that with
these changes, arrangements can be
made to raise all the money that will \,<*
necessary for the proposed improvements
without calling upon the State to Issue
bonds for the purpose. The g.ntlemen In
terested expect to get together a*aln
some time next week and discuss the
matter further.

an estate valued at 1800,000, to file her
final account on or before December 15.
A few days ago the heirs of the deceased

that the assets were gradually falling Into
the hands of the lawyers and the estate
would soon be absorbed. Mr. Rowc hus

Endowment.
>
I Attorney Russell J. Wilson, who has
been In New York as the representative
of Mrs. Jane L. Stanford, returned home
yesterday. During his absence he has ar
ranged the big deal by which the Immense
holdings of Mrs. Stanford in the Southern
and Central Pacific Railroad companies
were disposed of. although Mr. Wilson
will not confess that ho had much to do
with it.
"I cannot enter Into a discussion of that
transaction," said Attorney Wilson, "be
cause I would prefer that Mrs. Stanford
gave her own version of the affair. Before
leaving New York Mrs. Stanford told me
that she would leave for San Francisco
and would come across the continent by
eaST stages. I understand that a. great
deal about the alleged sale of Mrs. Stan
ford's railroad properties has been sent
here from New York, but I am not suffi
ciently acquainted with what has been
published to say how much of It is cor
rect. As a matter of fact, although I
have been asked scores of times. I have
not yet conceded that Mrs. Stanford has
transferred her stock.
"Although I am Mrs. Stanford attor
ney. 1 paid little attention to the manner
In which her attitude may have affected
the market or the possible bearing It may
have had on the balance of the Southern
Pacific stock. My client will be here In a
few days and will not spend the winter
In the East. I have no doubt she will be
pleased to talk about her future plans on
her arrival. Just what she may Intend to
do concerning the welfare of Stanford
University I cannot state, and doubtless
she will not outline her plans until after
her arrival."
It was generally supposed that Mrs.
Stanford would not come to the coast
until after Christmas, and her early re
turn is taken to indicate that there am
likely to be some Interesting developments
lit Palo Alto. With the conversion of her
immense railroad holdings into cash Mr?.
Stanford Is now In a position to carry
out her great desire to endow the
institution founded by her late husband.
Just in what manner she may decide to
invest her fortune for the benefit of the
university is a matter of great public in
terest and concern, and Attorney Wilson
says that she has not divulged any of her
Intentions. Mrs. Stanford will arrive here
the latter part of next week.
KEMP A POOR WITNESS.
Does Not Enlighten the Grand Jury
on the School Scandal.
It was expected that some sensational
testimony would be glv.Â»n by School Di
rector Kemp before the Grand Jury yes
terday afternoon relating to the J3UOO
scandal In which his colleagues, Conlon
and Gedge, were mixed up. It wan
thought that Kemp, who had been made
the catspaw in the scheme to appoint a
batch, of new teachers, was going to re
taliate on n. certain member of the minor
ity who had promised to make the sev
enth vote necessary to pass the resolu
tions presented l.y Kemj> at the last
meeting of the board. This seventh mem
ber, whose r.anif 1r kept lift, bad
promised to vote with K<mp 'f the latter
would give testimony against Conlon and
Gedge Defer* the OnUM Jury.
Expect. itions were not realixed. how
ever, as Kemp proved to he a very poor
and DBWillinff witness and he did not
enlighten the Grand Jury to any great ex
tent as :â > 'hi- methods emi>l>>; â¢â¢<! l>v Coa

the inquisitors. In the mutter of the
contracts awarded to the Weber Furni
ture Company for $*Â»J" for desks the
Grand Jury gathered from the replies of
| Kemp that the Supplies Committee had
awarded ;lie contract to the company nnd
that the rest of the board kn?w nothl.ig
about the matter until after It waa all
over. K?mp, when asked what ha.i In
come of rlie old desks, answered that he
did not know. and. in fart, all of hi* an

Grand Jury was obliged to excuse him.
Child Was Not Poiioned.
Anita Rothschild. aya v six-year-old child,
died under suspicious circumstances at
her home. Â»15 Polk street, last Thursday.
It was believed that the child had eaten
some cheap French candy which con
tained poison. Dr. Ward, who attended
the case, could not positively determine
the causa of death and the body was
turned over to Coroner Hill. The remains
had been embalmed, but Dr. Zabala nev
ertheless performed an autopsy, and found
th.it death had been due to pleural pneu
