Pietennartizburg are too weak to attempt
to reopen communication. Artillery an^
cavalry especially are badly needed, and
it necessarily will take a long time to ob
tain either, owing to the difficulty of en
training and the necessity of allow: the

From the Indiscriminate distribution of
the various divisions at unexpected points
it seems clear that the original plans of
GonÂ»raJ ttullcr ha.vj b*Â»Â»*n wholly t>.h.u)Â£e<L.
Not ieÂ« slightest word regarding thÂ» new
plans has been allowed to escape.
It has been reported that the Belmont
fight arose owing to the advance of a
British column to relieve Klmberley. but
this seems Incorrect, all of the most re
liable accounts representing the engage
ment as growing out of a reconnolssanco.
The announcement of the arrival of Gen
eral Methuene at Orange River, however,
doubtless means that arrangements are
In a forward state for an advance from
that point. If the advance has not already
b*>gun.
Klmberley was safe on Friday. Novem
ber 10. Last Tuesday a Boer force of GW
entered Allwal North, Cape Colony, hoist
ed the flag of the Free State and declared
the town and district to be part of the
republic. The activity of the Boers In
this locality would almost point to the
necessity of Insuring the safety of the
column marching to the relief of Klmber
ley from attack from this direction or
from iiioemfonteln.
In view of the reticence of General Bul
ler It Is almost useless to speculate re
garding the report of a movement to re
lleve Kimberley. It can only be Intended
to draw the Boers, If possible, from
Natal. The object of the occupation of
Allwal North. It is understood to be to
prevent the large quantity of ammunition
at HerÂ» f>Â»-ing forwarded to James
town and thence to the Queen's Own.
The Boers have notified the inhabitants
that no looting will bo allowed. There are
reliable reports of mysterious movements
Of Free State commandos along thÂ« Or
ange River, and Important developments
are expected. Everything tends to show
that the relief of Klmberlev could only
be *afely undertaken by a strong column.

â¢ \t of the conclusions and reeom-
Uon of the b..ard which witnessed
The Call ar.d Herald naval trials of

The board is highly enthusia.-t
the results r.f the experiment and has
recommended the system be given a trial

Lieutenant Ommander J. T. Newton and
OIL WORKS MARKED FOR DESTRUCTION BY OAKLAND DYNAMITERS.
Lieutenants J. B. Bllsh and F. K. Hill,
and their report was submitted to Rear
Admiral Bradford. These are their con
clusions and recommendations:
"It Is well adapted for use In squadron
signaling under conditions of rain. fog.
darkness and motion of speed. Wind,
rain, fog a- other conditions of weather
do not affect transmission through space,
but dampness may reduce range, rapid
ity and accuracy by impairing the insula
tion of the aerial wire and instruments.
Darkness has no effect.
"We have no data as to the effects of
rolling and pitching, but excessive vibra
tion at high speed apparently produced no
bad effect on instruments, ana we believe
the working of the system would be very
little affected by the motion of a ship.
"When two transmitters are sending at
the Fame time all receiving wires within
range receive impulses from transmitters,
and tapes, although unreadable, show un
mistakably that such double sending is
taking place. /
"In every case, under a great number
of varied conditions, attempted Interfer
ence was complete. Mr. Marconi, although
ho stated to the board before these at
tempts wore made that he could prevent
Interference, nrver explained how. nor
made any attempt to demonstrate It could
be done.
"Between large ships (heights of masts
130 and 140 feet) and a torpedo boat
(height of mast 45 feet), across open
water, signals can be read up to seven
miles o nthe torpedo boat and eighty-five
miles on" the torpedo boat and eighty-five
be Interrupted altogether when tall build
ings of Iron framing Intervene.
"The rapidity is not greater than twelve
words per minute for skilled operators.
The sending apparatus and wire would in
juriously affect the compass if placed near
it. The exact distance is not known, and
should be determined by experts.
"The system Is adapted for use on all
vessels of the navy, including torpedo
boats and small vessels, as patrols, scouts
and dispatch boats, but It is Impracticable
in a small boat.
"For landing parties the only feasible
method of use would be to erect a pole
on shore and then communicate with the
ship.
"ThÂ«Â» system could be adapted to the
telegraphic determination of difference of
longitude In surveying.
"The board respectfully, recommends
that the system be given a trial In the
navy." _____^__^^___

SURVEYING PARTY SAFE.
Mrs. Stocker Receives a Telegram
From Her Husband.
LOS ANGELES. Nov. 17.â That the sur
veying party believed to have been lost In
the Gulf of California Is safe It indicated
by this telegram, received late this after
noon by Mrs. Ada B. Stocker:
"CII. A BEND. Ariz.. Nov. 17.â Repret

Mr. Stocker was a member of the parly

that there was no foundation for the
story that the party was carried out to

ATTEMPT TO DESTROY

of dynamite. The successful consumma
tion of the plot, whatever might have
been Its underlying motive, was .nipped
in the bud through the accidental discov
ery by two smoll boys of the dynamite
that was to have been used In the de- .
structive work.

Chief of Police Hodgklns. his captains
and sergeants. A. Edward Cushing. su
perintendent of the works, was exceed
ingly loth at first to discuss the affair
or give out and particulars. He expresses
the opinion 'that perhaps the. motive of
the dynamiters was I ft the destruction
Of the big plant with its huge, oil tan*Â». :
but robbery, burglary and safe-cracking.
However, if the latter theory proves ten
able then it would appear that the m!d
night marauders, who, in the late hoid
ups. terminating In the cold-blooded mur
der of John Thomas, a West Oakland |
saloon-keeper, and who have thus iur I
successfully evaded the police. Duve
adopted a new method of piyins" luetf
criminal occupation.
It appears that yesterday afternoon,
shortly after 5 o'clock, two small boys.:
whose names Superintendent Gushing. In
the excitement of the moment, failed to
learn, found two sticks of dynaroli con
cealed beneath a small pile of two-Inch
planks on an inclosed lot in the rear of
the oil plant and facing Dalton's foun
dry. The boys were playing hide at. I seek
at the tlmo and one of them, crouching
behind the lumber pile nearest Certar
street, discovered the sticks. Whether '
the boys Intuitively suspected the dan
gerous nature of their find or regarded It
as valuable material mislaid and belong
ing to th* oil works Is not known.
However, they promptly carried, the
dynamite around the corner to the oil
company's ofllce. where rhey apprised
Superintendent Cushlng of what they: had
found and how and where.
A hasty Inspection, and the superintend- I
ent, realizing the character of the sticks,
divined the criminal purpose with which
the dangerous things had been concealed.
Visions of the ruined plant, of the big ell
tanks blown up. of the ofllce safe cracked
and the day's collections therein deposits
gone, filtted through Superintendent Cuah-
Ing's mind, and he promptly sent word to
police headquarters.
Chief of Police Hodgklns early in the
evening detailed Sergeant McKlnley, Of
ficers Pardee and Murray and two others
on the case. The officers were Ml out
to keen a sharp lookout in the neighbor
hood for any and all strange and sus
picious characters and report at Intervals
to Sergeant McKlnley at Dalton's Foun
dry, opposite the oil plant, on Cedar
street. The district Is an extremely de
serted one at nlicht and Is poorly lighted,
the oil works being scarcely 150 feet from
the bay shore. All through the cold night
the ofllcers patrolled the district, eagerly
watching until 3 o'clock this morning, by
which time five suspects had been' round
ed up and landed In the City Prison As
for absolute clews. It Is not known -wheth
er the police discovered any: but at my
rate the police In th. zealous vigilance
succeeded In frustrating the plot that un
questionably involved criminal motive
"Just what the motive of the plotters
who concealed the dynamite beneath the
lumber In the unlnclosed lot back of our
works might have been.'" said Superin
tendent Cushlng to-day, "we do not know
but there was the dynamite, discovered

tain Wilson stated this afternoon that

last night were released during to-day
without divulging the cause that led to
their arrest.
The local plant of the Standard Oil
Company is for the most part a briric
structure. The office is located in the
southwest Corner and toward the reir of
the works and nearest the spot where the
dynamite was found tower three hue*
Iron tanks usually holding from 12/u) to
IS.ouO gallons of oil each. The. plant Is
one or the most- valuable of the com

destruction by dynamite would have In

CHURCHILL REFUSED TO
ESCAPE FROM THE BOERS
After Having Been Carried Out of Danger He Picked
Up a Rifie and Returned Alone to
Attack the Enemy.
ESTCOTJRT, Natal. Nov. 16.â A correspondent who has Just visited the Santorlum Hospital says all the armotvd
train wounded are doing well.
Captain Wylle, in an Interview, oald Sergeant Tod deserves special menMon for having surrounded him with bowi
<Vrs to protect him from the rifle fire when lying wounded anÂ«l helpless, r ><1 even lay down beside the officer to
'ilm up. A shell landed amourf the protecting bowlders. BD&ttertng them with earth, but Cnptaln Wylle sustained
no further Injury. But for Tod he won: n kill.d. Beveral men escaped marvel :>usÂ«ly. When Winston t'hurch

train 'â¢like ruin." The m<>n throughout stuck to their work, res] tog to the noble example set by Churchill and LJeu
tenant Frankland until the lino was etear.
Churchill actually lÂ»Â«ft with the engine, but he got out at the next Btatlon. There he took, a rifle from a soldier,
saying he could not leave the wouml.il, ;tn.l walked away in th<- direction of the Boers.
Sergeant HaÂ»sett of the Dublin Fus.;..-rs behaved with the greatest guilantly. He took charge of the firing
party and Stood up unflinchingly during the Boers' hot fire. His example electrified the Fuslleers, who kept the Boers
at bay by volleying.
CaptSin Haldane fell early In Â»he engagement, shot through the shoulder.
.Lieutenani Frankland's conduct is highly praised. He exhibited great coolness during the critical period. He Is
reported missing.
Copeland of -Che Purbnn volunteers was crushed to denth by the derailed track, and Godfrey, a plate layer, was

Ootjttnurd from First Pur*.
continually demonstrating their superior
! cunning.
The official account of the disaster to
the Esicourt armored train, showing that
i a hundred missing men are now probably
! already on their way to Pretoria to swell
the large number of British prisoners al
ready there, besides a score of wounded,
. demonstrates, it is claimed, that the Brit
ish must have encountered big odds, as
I all accounts agree that the small British
force fought with the utmost bravery.
Winston Churchill's brilliant behavior is
compared with the gallant action in thÂ«
; Tirah campaign which won Lord Fincas
tlr, there also acting as a newspaper cor
respondent, the Victoria Cross. The rail
road men of Estcourt have already for
j warded a dispatch to the general manager
j of the railroad expressing admiration for
i the coolness and pluck of young Church--
I i11,. t0 whose c Hurts they attribute the
i raving of the engine ' and tender and
' wounded, and asking. the manager to con
vey their admiration for the brave man.
There are rumors of another disaster to
an Eateourt train, and it is reported that
twenty-five volunteers who formed the es
cort are missing. There is no continua
tion of these reports.
When drflnlte news from LÂ»adysmith Is
available ?t will doubtless be found that
i the- garrison has been having a lively
time. Nevertheless, not much credence
should be paid to the stories of train
loads of Boer wounded taken toward
j Pretoria as the result of the crushing de
feat at the hands of the British. Experi
; ence has shown that those Kafllrgrams,
even though emanating from missionaries,
, are not . trustworthy. However, there
seems no doubt that there have been some
sharp- affairs. Heavy rifle firing, follow
ed by an explosion, was heard in the di
rection .of I>adysmith before daylight
j Thursday, indicating a night surprise, and
i possibly tije explosion of a magazine.
The transports, officially announced to
day as having arrived at Capo Town, car
ried the following troops:
The Maltaâ Mounted Infantry Reserves
and the Coldstream Guards, total 75 of
j fleers and ILB7 enlisted men.
The City of Viennaâ cavalry brigade
staff. Twelfth lancers and a field hos
pital; total, IS Officers and 310 men.
The City of Cambridgeâ The Second
Scottish Rifies and a field hospital; total,
40 officers and 9Â£5 men.
A dispatch from Pretoria gives the Min
ister of Mines interim announcement of
| the gold output for October as a total of
â  17.545 ounces, against 426,556 In September
and 452.108 in August. The dispatch adds,
i somewhat Ironically, that some of the
companies have not worked the full
month.
The Standard and Diggers' News an
i nounces that 6000 Boers are marching
I through Zululand. It says that a deserter
â¢ from I^adysmlth reports some anxiety
among the troops to escape, and that the
provisions are loaded on wagons ready for
the flight of the British.

FICKLE AH QUAY
CAUSES TROUBLE
Elopes With Her Lover
From Angeles.
Special Dlspatrh to The Tall.
ANGELS CAMP. Nov. IT -Th- local
Chinatown Is at a high, pitch of excite
ment and the trouble will probably sprrad
to other Chinese communities. The cause
of all this disturbance Is pretty .little Ah
Quay. Some time ago she went to. Tu r
lare to live and there she met How Toy.
an almond-eyed Celestial.', who married
her. Life In Tulare was too tame for. Ah
Quay and her Indulgent husband moved
to San Francisco, . where he. opened ; a
tailoring establishment at 10Q4 Duporit
Street. About this time Ah Tom, 1 .. .m
other Chinaman, with an eye /or beauty,
fell a victim to the Chinese maiden's lov
ing glances and shortly afterward they
shook the dust of the - metropolis from
their feet together and went to San An
dreas, this county, where the father of Ah
Tom la a prominent merchant. '.' Again Ah
Quay's love grew cold and she left her
lately acquired protector and went to
Sonora, Tuolumne County, and later to
this place.
In the haunts of Chinatown she reigned
as the belle. Her admirers were many
and more than once a bitter fight between
rival suitors was barely averted. This
was the case about three weeks ago
when the young Chlnamt-n who consider
ed themselves ellgil â  for her smiles de
clared themselves, and for a time It look
ed as though a bloody battle would be the
outcome of their declarations. This state
of affairs has continued at Intervals ever
since, but the climax was reached lately
when her legal husband made his appear
ance among am. He expressed hw In
tention to regain his. lost spouse and take
her to his home In San Francisco.
It was only a matter of a short time
before Ah Qua.] was advised <â ( How
Toy's Intentions, and abe prepared Aer
self to meet htm. She consulted with a
favorite lover. Lorn Loon, the Cook at a
hotel, and they decided that the place
was too uncomfortable for. them and they
would Keek more agreeable dimes. Mean
while the husband was bringing all this
Influence to bear to the end that he might
regain his wife. He proposed to her to
accompany him back to his home, but she
did not agree to his proposition. How
Toy was determined, and decided to use
force. He told of the great amount of
money Ah Quay had cost him and he
wanted satisfaction in some way. Stormy
Interviews took place between them fre
quently. Finally, on last Tuesday morn-
Ing. An Quay lied to her lover In dfftpsJr
and together Lorn Loon and his iWMt
heurt took â  carriage and drove to Valley
Springs. From there they went to l. Â»il
and disappeared to the world. When How
Toy discovered that he had been outwit
ted he was furious, and started in hot
pursuit.
He has declared that he will recover his
lost property or wreak vengeance on the
head of the despoiler of his domestic life.
It la thought that he has invoked Jhe
assistance, of the highbinder element, nfM
the outlook is bad for Lorn Loon. . Ah
Quay Is a very handsome Chinese girl
and has attracted a great deal of atten
tion among the white people here. China
town Is In an uproar, although the wily
Celestials are apparently Ignorant' that
an elepement of more than ordinary color
has occurred in their- midst. .

WASHINGTON, Nov. 17. TIM President
has refu.Â«ed to accept the resignation of
Mr Damon, the Hawaiian Minister of
Finance, and that official will remain In

such outside matters. The resignation
was tendered under those conditions, but
as. Mr. Damon has nines .terminated thÂ«
connrctlon between hlnisÂ»tfi Â«nd thw or
ganization referred to. tho reason for Its

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LINCOLN, Nob.. Nov. 17.â Rumors
started upon the announcement that Sen

cover from his present paralytic stroke,
ih.it Qorarnor Poynter w^uui appolnt-\W
J. Bryan to nil the term between now
and the assembling of the next Legis
lature, one year hence, have grown. Mr.
Bryan is In the mountains of Southern
Missouri, but several telegrams of mys
terious Importance have been exchanged i
between Mr. Bryan and Governor Poyn
ter In the last twenty-four hours.
Another feature of the situation Is the!
presence In Lincoln to-day of former Sen
ator \V V Allen. He culled upon the
governor, but JuÂ«t what the purpose of
his trip wan Is not dear Then* is ne
doubt that Mr. Allen would view the ap
pointment ol Mr. Bryan to the position at
ii.is time very pleasantly.
Many fusion leaders here insist that
Bryan ought to be appointed at this time
and not wait until next year, when If he
is defeated for the Presidency he might
and undoubtedly would accept the posi
tion. His friends argue that he could
accept the position and use it legitimately
to promote his Interests as a Presidential
candidate.
N â¢ oouiit iÂ« expressed by either sl<iÂ«*
that Mr Bryan will develop Into an ac
tlve Benatorfal candidate Immediately af
ter the elections next fall, provided he in

MRS. GRIFFIN WAS
OF UNSOUND MIND
Testimony of Dr. Steph
ens and Others.
â¦
Special PiFpatr-h to The Call.
PAN RAFAEL.. Nov. 17.â "You can't
bulldoze me. sir. and you might as well
cease trying. I have been on the witness
stand too many times not to know what I
nm doing. The woman was crazy, and
her own relatives knew It better than
anybody else."
These angry and emphatic words were
spoken by Dr. J. I. Stephens to-day while
testifying in the Griffin will contest In re
sponse t<Â« an attempt of Attorney Mullany
to browbeat bin Into an admission, that
certain statements the physician had lust
made were, not supported by facts. The
answer of Dr. Stephens, which provoked
the scene, was given to a question Incau
tiously asked by the lawyer for the dej
fendaut Mrs O Connor, and was of such
â  vital nature that consternation pre
vailed amonc the cohorts for the defense,
Attorney Mullany tried hard to rectify
tils error, hut merely succeeded In arous
ing the Ire of the witness oy his eavape
verbal assaults.
Dr. Stephens hi an assistant Police BUT
sreon of Ban Francisco, a member of the
Sonoma County Insanity Commission and
an assistant In the medical clinic of the
University of California. On account of
his high "professional standing the de
fendant's attorneys endeavored to dis
credit his testimony, an endeavor that
ended disastrously. The query of Mul-
Inny was hypothetical, the lawyer wish
inK to know" if Mrs. Griffin's delusion that
she saw the visions of her 'â¢ eased hus
band and daughter tended to show that
she was Insane.
"Without a doubt." was the ready an
swer "Everybody knew Mrs. Griffin was
mentally unbalanced, and her relatives
best of "all." . ,
As Mullany had asked thÂ» question
for the <lefei.se and there bad been no
objection from the plaintiff** counsel the
answer hs 1 to stand. There were other
sensations sprung during the lad day of
the plaintiffs inning and Dr. Winn of
Tomales pgain made himself conspicu
ous by Ms failure to appear in court.
Dr Winn was arrested last evening at
Tiliuron by officer . Cottlngham on a
bench warrant issued by Judge Am/el
lottl and â¢ n being haled before his Honor
promised to appear In court as a witness
for the ,-i.iintiff at 9 o'clock this morn-
Ing but failed to keep his promise. Af
ter' a consultation between plaintiff's
lawyers it was decided to carry on the
case without Winn's evidence.
Dr. Jul-s Simon, the well-known insan
ity expert, was placed on the stand, and
In reply ; " hypothetical questions gave
It as his opinion that the actions of Mrs.
Gritlln proved she was mentally unlal
.,,,,.,,] Dr. C C Wadsworth of the Ban
Francisco Lunacy Commission testified
to the same effect. William Vanderbllt
also gave st as his opinion 'hati Mrs.Grif
tin was not of sound mind. 1
Cashier Thomas Abies of the Tomnies
bank testified that thÂ«; deceased woman
was feeble-minded and that the bank
treated her and looked out for her inter
ests the tame as If she had been a child.
Me started to mention the fact that three
years ago the relatives had petitioned
that a guardian be appointed for her
when he was stopped : by an objection.
Mrs. O'Connor was then sworn and de
clared that all Hhe knew of the existence
of a will had been told her by a female
acquaintance. She had. taken no Interest
In thÂ» will whatever. The case was ac
cordingly closed for the plaintiff and the
defendant will begin the Introduction if
evidence :n rebuttal next Tuesday: The
way the case looks now the general trend
of opinion is that the testament will be
set aside. . ____________

COMMERCE COMMISSION ADJOURNS
TO MEET ON THE PACIFIC COAST
Delegation From West of the Rockies Pleased With the
Result of the Showing Made Against the
Claims of St. Louis Jobbers.
I ST. LOUIS. Nov. -The testimony
L before the. Interstate Commerce
Commission this forenoon was very
ij Interesting and Instructive, treating
of ocean competition with railroads
on business between the Atlantic and Pa
' cific coasts.
It was shown that large quantities of
i nearly all staple articles were now being
carried by water at rates ranging from
130 to 50 cents per hundred pounds. R. 1,,.
I Walker, the tratnc manager of the Pana
ma Railroad and Steamship Company,
testified that his company controlled the
Panama Railroad and the three steamers
connecting with it from New York to
Colon and was entirely independent of nil
other carriers by water or rail; that It
connected with the Pacific Mail Company
hi Panama, but had the absolute power to
fix rates on all goods going to the Pacific
Coast and did so with an eye single to
Its own Interests. Mr. Walker added that
it carried at least MM tons a month of
goods bound to San Francisco and some
times more: that he made the rates so as
to secure that amount of tonnage from
. the railroads and reduced them at times
so as to attract business If he needed It
to till his steamers; that he expected the
number of steamers would be increased
SAN FRANCISCO THE BUTTLE GROUND OF THE JOBBERS.
San Francisco will be the ground on
which the contest for the trade of the
Pacific CMS! Will be fought out by the
St. Louts Jobbers and the business men
of the coast. W. R. Wheeler, who has
closely watched the proceedings -at St.
Louis before the Interstate Commerce
Commissioners and who has a complete
I knowledge of all the points at issue, said
yesterday that nothing new has been
brought ''i' at St. Louis'. The conditions
are the same so far as the showing of
facts and the equity of the case are con
cerned as they were fore the St. Louis
people Instituted the pending suit. All *he
facts now known were fully developed at
St. Paul when the matter was threshed
over before representatives of the north
ern transcontinental railways last Ms;
The Pacific Coast had not developed Its
case In evidence at St. Louis. : ut would
do that In San Francisco. A singular i d
mission had been made by the head of
one of the largest business houses In St.
Louis In his testimony, which was to the
effect that his concern had been able to
' do buslnoss on the coast under the ex
isting conditions; also that while he had
established a liranch house on the coast
the expense ot the enterprise was about
the same as the amount of the differen
. tials would be In a year. The person who
made this admission was Mr. Nelson,
president of the N. O. Nelson Manufac
turing Company.
CORAL REEFS ON
BRAZIL'S COAST
The Brauner Party Com
pletes Investigation.
Special Dispatch to The CnH.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Nov. 17.â
Dr. J. C. Rrauner. vice president of I
Stanford University and head of the de
partment of geology, arrived here to-day
on his return from Brazil, where he has
been for the past Mix months studying the
geological conditions of the country and
Islands along the coast. The expedition,
of which Dr. Brauner was the head, was
sent out by Professor Agasslz of Harvard.
The party left Stanford on the 12th of
last May, going Immediately to Rio,
Brazil, by way of New York. In the
party there wen seven undergraduate I
I Stanford students, besides Dr. Brauner,
who was chosen for this Important work
both on account of his high standing in
the scientific world and his thorough ac
quaintance with the geological conditions
of Hrazii. where he resided for eight
years.
Dr. Brauner has a report of his obser
vations almost ready for the printer. It
will cover over GOO pages. Most of this
work on this report was done before he
left Rio.
In commenting upon the geological con
ditions of the coast. Dr. Brauner said that
while most of the reefs were of coral
formation, many of hardened sand beds
and old sandstone were found. Over 320)
miles were traversed In Brazil. 1300 of
i which were along the coast and 11*00 In the
interior. Few specimens were collected.
as the prime object of the trip was y>
make â  study of the coast history.
Sixteen years had elapsed since Dr.
Brauner had been In Brazil, hence he was
much Interested In the economic and so
cial changes that had taken place. Brazil
is a country of almost Inexhaustible re
i sources and boundless domain, the chief
Industries being the gathering of rubber
and the raising of sugar cane, tohacco.
coffee, cocoa and cattle. Borne gold and
manganese mines are quite productive.
i but diamonds are very scarce, except the
| black diamond, which Is used in drilling.
' The competition of the Klmberlev mines
'â  in the caus" of the Blackness of diamond
mining In South America. Dr. Brauner
paid Brazil was a good place for am
bitious young Americans to keep away
from unless they went there under con
tract.
The most notable change that has taken
place In social conditions In South Amer
ica during the last sixteen years Is the
i advancement which the women have
I made. Now they appear on the main
I streets of the larger cities unattended,
while formerly they were never seen In
public unless accompanied by chaperones.
Rio Janeiro, the largest city and capital
of the Brazilian republic. Is a city of over
000.000 Inhabitants, with all the modern
Improvements. Dr. Brauner says that
the Brazilians as a people dislike walking
so their cities are well supplied with
streetcar systems.
Several Stanford graduates have located
In Brazil. H. K. Williams 'Â« is head of
the geological survey of the State of Sao
Paulo. Charles Dulley 'M Is electrician
for a lighting company In the city of Sao
Paulo, while Fred Duller '97 and Miss
Adams '00 are employed as teachers In
the city schools there.

"With a view to securing a good place to

sent from lounger shortly after noon oil
il>e ]2th to reconnolter the town of pato
about four miles farther on the lak 'â

Immediately opened flre from behind an
almost Impenetrable undergrowth on the

tOlinajre for them. He said htÂ» had If mod
a good deal about the freight situation
v.'hlle attending the sessions of the com
mission and was already planning to get
additional business from the Middle West.
The witnesses for St. Louis have been
trying to make It appear that many of
the classes of goods which they dealt In
are not subject to sea competition, such
as bar and sheet iron, brass goods, earth
enware, cartridges, plumbing materials
and the like. Mr Walker said he had
been carrying and was ready to take all
these commodities on his steamers In
large or small quantities and at any time
with the exception of a few things like
gunpowder, which the law prohibited
from Ix-lng carried on passenger steam
ers. This completely exploded the theory
of complainant and established an active
and exciting competition on all the goods
generally carried by rail from this sec
tion.
[Tpon cross-examination the complain
ants tried to show that the Panama Com.
pany was tied up with the Pacific Mall,
(â â¢it Mr Walker was emphatic and ex
plicit that the only arrangement with that
company was that of connecting carriers
by which the Pacific Mall took their
freight and carried It to San Francis,
for .1 fixed percentage of the whole earn
ings, while his company took that going
to New York on a similar basis, but he
was absolutely free to make rates on
The significance in this admission was
the tin contradiction that it made t" the
claim upon which the complaint in thÂ»*
St. Louu jobbers' suit was based, Dime*
ly. that the present conditions had shut
St. Louis and the Middle West out of .he
trade of the Pacific <""ast. Th< fad m.iy

hearing it St. Paul the neisons who
heard the testimony were representatives
of the Great Northern and the Northern
Pacific Railways.
"Reading of the â¢ viAt nici c t. li graphically
reported,* said Mr. wheeler, "shows thai
no new contention has been raised. To
me it seems â  repetition of the hearing
at St. Paul so far as the Middle VV.-t
jobbers an concerned. The same people
nave talked tor th.m and the testimony
for them is Just iixiut the same. Equity
and Justice and logic have no ni"re place*
in their rlalm a*. St. Louis than they had
at St. Paul. They are simply trying to

nothing for the i<<bj>er of th>- Pacific
' 'â .;,-(. As 't appears n>i\v. the Middle

an- surprised that the Middle \v. st i-v

disposed his command to execute a flank

ing a heavy fire Into the advance guard.
Four of them were killed and three
wounded, one mortally. Of these the lat
ter and three killed belonged to â  party
'â  of five flankers who had been sent up the

Initial Boxing Tournament Before
the Reliance Club Proves a Great
Success â Simpson and
Tye Draw.
OAKLAND, Nov. 17.â The first boxtng
tournament at the Reliance Club since It
Ã¼bsorbed over half the membership of the
late Acme Club produced some splendid
sport, and there was not the least fault to
find with any of the decisions. President
Fitzgerald congratulated the members of
the club on the great crowd present, ami
his timely suggestions were cordially re
ceived and cheerfully complied with.
Pete Recount of the Olympic Club re
peated his success of a few weeks ago,
when he knocked out Billy Springfield in
the same ring. He was matched to tight
ten rounds with Ed Smith of this city,
but two was enough. Smith, although a
very clever boxer, was plainly outclassed.
In the first round Reconnl was hit a few
times, but he was only sizing up his man.
In the second round Reconnl let himself
out and in the second half knocked Smith
down three times, and when the gong
sounded Smith was completely beaten.
His seconds were inclined to throw up
the sponge when Captain Peterson signi
fied that the contest was over.
Charlie Tye and George Simpson of the
West Oakland Club fought a pretty and
lively battle for ten rounds, and the con
test was declared a draw. Both men
were in splendid condition and fought
gamely from start to finish. Tye. as
usual, did all the leading, but received thÂ»
most of the punishment. Simpson was
least tired at the end. but the decision
was eminently fair.

City Prison, suspected of being a coun
terfeiter and an escaped felon. He was
arrested late last night by Officers "Winz
ler and Galloway and Secret Service
Agent Cronin, who, despite his protesta
tions of innocence, unceremoniously
dragged him from the Wiehman House on
Mission street and placed him in a cell
until to-day, when an Investigation will
be made to discover whether he is the
bold criminal who has successfully evaded
the United States authorities for two
years.
Boehlman is 35 years old and a brewer
by occupation. He is believed to be a
clever counterfeiter and to have escaped
from a steamer while in the custody of
an officer who was taking him from Lor
Angeles to San Quentin. Boehlman would
not have been captured but for Informa
tion given Officer Winzler by a "mess"
boy, who asserts that he Is sure that the
prisoner is the man he served with meals
en route from Los Angeles. Boehlman
denies the charges made against him, and
is confident that he will prove his inno
cence at the proper time. He will be
handed over to the United States Mar
shal this morning.

TAX COLLECTOR SHEEHAN RE
FUSES TO ACCEPT.
The Offered Amount Over $9000 Less

Calls For.
Yesterday morning the Market-street
Railway Company, through Its agent, E.
B. Ryan, tendered to Tax Collector Shot
han the sum of $228,256 95 as payment for
the company's personal property taxes,
the said sum representing the amount cal
culated on the assessment as returned by
Assessor Podge. As this assessment had
been raised by the Board of Super-.
sitting as a Board of Equalization, to an
amount which increased the taxes J97SO,
which Ryan refused to pay, Tax Collector
Sheehan likewise refused to accept th*
check unless It was raised to correspond.
to the figures on his books, which ere
$233,036 82. Ryan contended thai the
original assessment of Dr. Dodge, which
was $14,047,569, should stand and that the
Board of Supervisors had no right' or au
thority to increase the assessment to $14,
647.5C9, but that It is merely empowered to
reduce upon the sustalnment or a protest.
Upon Bheehan's refusal to accept
anything lest* than the amount the bill call
ed for, he wrote the following refusal
upon the reverse side of the bill at the re
quest of Ryan:

HARVARD'S CHANCES GOOD.
Probabilities That Yale Will Win the
Football Match.
BOSTON, Nov. 17.â A1l interest of the
football enthusiasts centers in to-mor
row's Mr Rame between Yale and Har
vard on the Harvard gridiron. The talk
of the conflict among .Harvard rooters to
night is that only a chance fumble can
allow Yale to score. However, the Yale
men are more confident than the earlier
form of the team would seÂ»-m to warrant.
Most Â«>f them pay Yale will rarely win:
more conservative ones hint at such a
result, while no one l- willing to admit
the probability of defeat. Yale did not
engage In any practice to-day. Harvard
put in twenty minutes of light signal
practice.

FOOTBALL MEN PREPARING
FOR THE GREAT STRUGGLE
On Form, as Shown in the Field, the University of Cal
fornia Eleven Should Repeat Last Year's
Victory.
ANOTHER week of practice and then
the college football teams will have
finished their heavy work prepara
tory .to the big- Thanksgiving day frame.
This coming. week is perhaps the most in
teresting of all the (season, for every day
.}Â» watched with nervous anxiety both for
Improvement In play and. for accidents.
â 'â  â¢ The situation at present is jus: what it
was two yeats ago. . In H% Stanford de
feated California to the tune of 20 to 0.
and in the â¢.r.ollLiwir.g season the Mue and
gold could' not get together, Try as it
would.: nothing attempted seemed to suc
ceed. As a laM resort the team went to
Del Monte fur the â¢ final practice, but. of
what avail this .proved to be the score of
that year C| to 0) shows. Last year Stan
ford was aii the cipher end of a 22 to 0
.score. To offset the possibility of a repe
tition this season the cardinal secured the
services of Chamberlin. Yale's captain of
I *'.">, and brought him out early In the.
season. Stanford's team to-day is nut
much better than California's two years
ago. Will Del Monte prove a panacea for
tne football ills of trie cardinal: is the
question asked by all.
As far M Stajilurd's playing in this city
goes, the team is in baa snape, not phys
icaily but .Â».- a team. 1 tie material is
light and with few exceptions inexperi
enced when compared with the eleven
on the other side of the bay. Every dis
advantage possible ftjemeii to thrust it
self upon Captain Murphy In the organi
zation of his team ana everything favored
captain Whipple trom the beginning or
the season, r.lnere coulu not ue a more
perfectly defined parallel with the names
of the teams reversed man the season of
two y^-ars ago.
The best criterion to base a Judgment
upon the relative merits of the two col
lege teams la the games of the Last two
weeks. Stanford met' tne Olympics two
weeks ago on a muddy field ajid scored a
touchdown, which wa-s earned. â¢ Captain
Murphy kicked a field goal and the score
stood â¢< to 5 at the end of the game In
favor of the Olympics. A week later Cal
ifornia met the Olympics on a field that
was the most poorly adapted to the blue
and gold style of play, yet three touch
downs were scored on the clubmen, and at
no time were the Olympics within possi
ble range- of point-makiug. While this
game was. in progress in this city Stan
ford and the university. of Nevada were
trying conclusions on the Palo Alto cam
pus. Stanford defeated the visitors, but
it w;as a game In which there was a con
test, the. score, of. 17 to 5 not being indica
tive of thÂ«-. playing. Four days later the
University of California eleven met the
University t>f.- Nevada' team and 24 to 0
!' was the â¢re.
; Thus everything points to another vic
i tory for California on. a purely form
tbasuu Of course much will depend upon
the work done during the present week.
j There have been occasions when over
i confidence has wrought defeat for a
[.clearly superior team-, and the blue and
gold. eleVtn.is certainly suffering from
this destructive bacillus. One thing the
I -Stanford team possesses and that is spirit
| ; and determination. . Not a man on the
â¢ team. lags, in -his work, and every effort
Is being made- .to bring together a team
that will make a showing 'for itself.

STANFORD MEN ARE HOPEFUL.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Nov. 17.â
The past week of training has been rather
a disappointment to the coaches of Stan
ford's football squad. The rains have
been too frequent to allow the grounds to
dry sufficiently for fast practice, while the
bad footing in the field may be blamed
for the injuries received by some of the
men.
The younger McFadden is still out of
the game on account of the sprain which
his knee ."tallied In the Nevada game
last Saturday. This leaves the fullback
position without it moat promising candi
date, all of the work now falling upon
Horen. who, though a good line-bucker.
has neither the weight nor the strength of
hia unfortunate predecessor.
The most serious accident of the season
has been the injury to Captain Murphy.
Just what this injury Is or how serious
it may become the doctors are yet unable
to say. The fact remains â¢ .-..-â¢ even
breathing la painful to the gallant quarter
back, and at th.- time when he is needed
most upon the field he is confined to the
side lines. With the loss of these two
men from the field the past week has In
deed been an unfortunate one for th. car
dinal.
With these exceptions the men are in
excellent condition and show as much zest
for the game as at any time during the
season. Smith and Fisher have shown
l they can be depended upon to make
; gains through a formidable line, as was
i Instanced last Saturday, when they
plugged holts in Nevada's lines or circled
i her ends for large gains. This ability
I to advance the ball anu finally carry it
I over their opponent's goal line Is the
| mo.Â«t encouraging feature of the last few
I practices. It moans that the Stanford
I boys are rounding Into form and appre
l date the value of team work.
The same three-cornered contest for end
I positions is being carried on between
Parker. Rice and T. McFadden. with the
probability that th- . result will not be
I known before th- team lines up on
! Thanksgiving day. There Is little worry
I over these places, as every one iâ ls that
however the struggle Is decided the ends
| will be well looked after.
, Center Is still a position of concern.
i Hayden. Ed Gllman. LÂ»-e and Johns arc
i In the race.' with chances about as in the
] order named.
At right tackle "Babe" Burnett is show-
Ing well. His work improves dally,
especially his block and breaking through.
Hentley. who has been playing the other
tackle position, has shown "little improve
ment In the last week. being often put out
, of the play by his opponent. Unless he
braces up it is likely that one of the men
now playing on the second team will fill
! left tackle in the final match.
â  Do Forest is a fixture at left guard and
I is the best man there since Fickert gradu
ated. The other guard win be either
Tra^ger. Cairns or Gllman. All three of
thÂ»-se men have the weight and action
necessary to fill the position.
With Captain Murphy Injured Erb and
Raitt are the prominent candidates for
quarterback, with the chances probably in
favor of the former.
One week from this morning Manager
Berry takes his team to th* seclusion of
Del Monte, where they will receive the
finishing touches Of the. coaches, at whose
head Is the redoubtable Chamberlin The
men have every confidence In him and he
! will bring them through to victory if it
can be- done. Those who are figuring up
the final score for Thanksgiving day must
remember that Stanford will be repre
sented by ateam or woll-tralned and per
fectly conditioned men who will not give
up â  gam*Â» while there remains In them
â  the strength to put up a formation.
The last game between Stanford and
Olympic will be played at the Sixteenth
and Folsom streets grounds to-day at 3
p. m. Stanford will line up the same as
In former games, with the exception that
Erb will be seen .at quarter. Bor'-n at full-
J back and either Cairns or Traeger right
i guard.

SAN RAFAEL GOLF COURSE
TO HAVE A WATER HAZARD
Los Angeles Country Club Golfers Play Over the Only
Full Eighteen Hole Course in This
State.
I Â» FEATHER permitting, the sixth i
fortnightly tournament the sixth i
fortnightly tournament of the San
Rafael Golf Club will be held to
day, the. principal events being a men's
handicap at eighteen holes and a women's
handicap at nine holes. The event pet
down on the schedule of the Oakland Golf
Club Is the fourth contest for the cap
tain's cup. but the Oakland goffers are !
devoting their attention so exclusively to
the teachings of "Willie'! Anderson and
Horace Rawllns that It is probable the
competition will be deferred. On Thanks- i
giving day there will be music and a re
ception at the clubhouse at Adams Point.
The San Rafael Golf Club on Thanks
giving day will hold a general tourna
ment, open to members of any golf club.
Members from other clubs who may wish
to enter the tournament should send In
entries, accompanied by three detailed
scores, signed by one or more members
of their club, and stating on what links
and dates the scores were made.
A circular announcing the conditions of
the open competition, match play, to be
held under the Joint management of the i
Oakland and San Francisco golf clubs, I
is being sent out by the secretaries to all
the golf clubs on the Pacific Coast from
Victoria. B. C, to San Diego Inviting en
tries. The first tournament will be held
on the Presidio links on Saturday, Decem
ber 9.
The work of Improving the San Rafael i
golf course is going on steadily. In front I
I of the fifth hole a water hazard is being i
made in a natural hollow. in which there .
will be plenty of water during half of the j
year. The water will be about fifty feet
across and on the banks will be planted
wild rose bus-he* to give the hazard a
; natural and pretty appearance.
In Mill Valley a few enthusiasts have
Improvised a golf course, which, so far
as the obstacles and diiTlcultles to be en
countered are concerned, leaves nothing
to be desired. The first hole Is 275 yards
long, and as the play Is along the county
road a pulled or sliced ball will go over
the fence and get the player into all sorts
of trouble. To the second hole the course
Is across a field, with rough ground and
trees. The distance Is 190 yards. The third
teeing ground Is beyond a grove of trees,
and from it the player must drive over a
five-board fence, up a hill eighty feet high
and down the opposite slope, the length
Of the hole being 420 yards. The fourth
hole Is protected by a natural hazard in
the shape of a creek fifteen feet deep and
nearly fifty feet wide from bank to bank.
Then the player proceeds up a little valley
for 301 yards, after which he returns and
I works his way back to the starting point.
It requires good golf to get safely across
the creek. in front of which there are two
ditches and rolling ground. The course
Is Interesting, and though it owes little
, or nothing to art Is decidedly sporty. The
principal players on It are J. 11. Faraday.
H. G. Playfair and T. T. Greaves.
The new links of the Los Angeles Coun
try Club, w*.lch were formally opened
by the big open tournament of the 4Â»h
Inst., provide the only full eighteen-hol<Â»
course to be found In California, and it Is
said that the new clubhouse surpasses

The name Escondldo. or hidden, is given
to the first hole because it is concealed
from the teeing ground near the club
house by an interposing hill. The third
hole. Terrace. Is on an elevation, and the
fifth is called Dinky, from its short dis
tance. El Puente means the bridge, and
Longacre is the longest hole . on the
course, being- nearly COO yards. Round
Top, Hillside and Mesa are named from
the nature of the ground in which they
: are situated, and El Rlncon (the corner)
I is In a corner of the links.

A new golf club lately formed near Los
I Angeles is the Coles I ove, which opened
its links two or three months ago. Cole
grove Is distant half an hour's ride by
electric car from the < enter of Los An
geles, and the first teeing ground of the
links is within a hundred yards of thÂ« sta
tion. The course was laid out a year ago
by Seward Colo, and has been greatly Im
proved under the directions of Dr. Allen.
E. Templar Allen and other golfers. The
course consists of nine hole*, each of
which la protected by a hazard. The nat
ural conformation of the ground provide*
several bunkers, and there are trees and
fences to supply the requisite further trib
ulation for the ardent golfer who pulls,
slices, tons or foozles his ball.
The wide spread of golf threatens to
absorb the world's available supply of
gutta-percha. The present price of golf
balls la from J3 50 to $4 a dozen, and would
be advanced if the supply of raw material
fell short. Chemists have repeatedly tried
to find a cheaper material for the. manu
facture of golf balls, but so far unsuc
cessfully, the balls they have made lack
ing durability and resiliency. Celluloid
balls have been tried, but they are. too
heavy and do not carry well Next to
new balls, old ones made over are best,
but they require time to season. A good
golf ball should keep Its shape, keep its
paint on and keep its line on the put when
. it is hit straight.

stronger than he was when he and Green
met before. Green is anxiously await

the decision given against him in his
fight with Nelll was unjust. Me hopes to
prove this by a decisive victory over his.

The Sacramento and San Francisco
baseball teams are to play their final me

th<? coming: contests la Intense. Although
It la generally conceded that the local ag

second place, still the member* of thÂ«
team retain a flickering ray of hope, and
they will have many followers on hand

I .-hip tlÃht the final games wll! no doubt â¢
I attract both the "fans" and thn-j* who
i like the came, as they can depÂ«-nd or. the
Friscos and the Sacramentos for good and
exciting exhibitions, as both teams have
never yet failed to keep the spectators
guessing from start to finish. There Is al
ways a prospect of an extra Innlrjr con
test when they meet, and In nearly every
series they have played It has been neces
sary for them to play more than the reg
ulation limit to deÂ»ide th* winner.
The most remarkable of their extra In

THE STANFORD ENDOWMENT.
â¢^pHE conversion of her various railroad holdings
THE money by Mrs. Stanford is of the highest
[n -
*. significance not only to California but to the
whole world's educational interests.
It brings in sight a final endowment of the T-e'.and
Stanford Jr. University amounting to thirty millions
of dollars. Safely invested at a minimum rate of in
terest this will yield an annual income sufficient for
the administration of the greatest university the world
has ever seen. Such an income can easily be the
means of transferring to California the highest teach
ing talent on the planet. Teachers and facilities for
original investigation make great universities, \\ ben
the Moorish universities in Spain were keeping the
lamp of learning aflame in the middle ages the work
depended upon the possession of means to command
the best teaching talent of that dark age. Their man
agers did not confine them to Mahometans in the
faculties, for Tew and Gentile alike were welcome to
their, ranks if they brought learning a:^l the gift of
imparting it What was true then as a factor in uni
versity policy is true now, and has been true ever
since. A university that could command the services
of Lavoisier, Humboldt, Agassiz, Huxley, Dar
win, De Laplace, Kepler or ... peers would
always have been great, no matter where lo
cated. The discoveries of science have so im
measurably enriched the modern world with
facts, with things known within the physical
universe, that there is on hand material to be men
tally digested and applied that will occupy the bright
est minds for generations to come.- The ancient
teachers, outside the school of Aristotle, had an easy
t2sk compared to that which is set for their modern
successors. Their labors were largely in the field of
metaphysics. The problems they had in hand were
largely psychological. But the world of those
problems has been circumnavigated and thoroughly
charted. Its winds and currents are mapped, its
shoals, reefs, capes and headlands are all as familiar
â  â :-:â¢â¢â â 
as the terms in which they are expressed.
The modem problems are physical. They concern
the origin and properties of .... and sound;
the effects of gravity, the origin and properties of
cosmic matter, and all the physical phenomena which
concern all forms of life. The modern student delves
in the mad slimes, and the relation of every physical
force to the development therein of primordial life.
He watches the hesitant stage of that life in which it
debates a choice between the animal and the vege
table form, and he seeks for the forces which, in either
conflict or concurrence, determine its final selection.
The university of to-day is the prompter of all im-r
provements in the application of natural energy to
the use of man. Chemistry and mechanics, analysis
and synthesis, the correlation of force, all of the
problems of matter and motion, re known to be con
vertible to economic use. The modern field and or
chard and vineyard, the method of convening their
product to human the means of its distribution to
the distant consumer; the study, of the rocks to de
termir.e the best purpose of their formation, and the
reduction cf ores that the imprisoned minerals,
precious and useful, of which they are the matrix,
may be freed, are all the vital concern of the modern
Everything, from a drop of rain to a grain of dust,
; is within the scope of scholastic inquiry.
j . It is plain, then, that a university for to-day and
i the future, if it propose to cover the vast field of
human interest, must have the amplest means o
, adapt it to us purpose. â¢
The Alexandrian Museum, with its library and
academic organization, which is the model of our
present day universities, had royal origin. Alexander
the Great and his half-brother, Ptolemy Sotei were
\ pupils of Aristotle, and both put the wealth of the
I Alexandrian conquests into the equipment of the
; Alexandrian school, to which the world owes a debt
; impossible of liquidation. The two Macedonian boys
i were moved by the noble sentiment of gratitude to
i their teacher, and to that the world owes an enlighten
! mer.t that will never be quenched. It is probable that
i from that far time until now no school has arisen
, equaling in the force behind it the one they founded,
I with the single exception of the Stanford University.
â  Its founders built and dedicated it to be the monu
; ment of a holy sorrow. In its development of all
that Aristotle dirr.ly sax, of all that was then inchoate
; and inceptive, this great university will light a lamp in
the world that will blaze undimmed in fellowship with
that which was lighted by the conquest of the world.
In a wonderful way Mi Stanford's energies have
I broadened with the burden laid upon them. She has
now greatly released herself from the distraction of
energy and attention inseparable from the manage
ment of her large investment in railroad property, and
i has in hand the immerse resources which are to be
j devoted to the one object and great work of her use
' ful life. What she has done and proposes is great not
: only in itself but in its example. Her work is a moral
1 spur to others v.ho cherish plans of the highest use
j fulness to man. But California, as the immediate
: beneficiary of her great motives and their conversion
j into great acts, salutes her with feelings inexpressible.
THE PflNflMfl CfINAL SCHEME.
PANAMA has applied for annexation to the
United States and the application has been de
nied. The reports from Washington, which
â  deal but briefly with the negotiations considering
i their importance, state that while Panama for some
time past has endeavored to maintain an indepen
dence, no Government has recognized her as a nation.
| She continues in the eyes of diplomacy to be one of
! the United States of Colombia, and it was to avoid
endangering our friendly relations with that republic
that our Government declined to consider the pro
posed annexation.
It is probable the movement for annexation on the
part of Panama is a part of the plan devised by the
| Panama Canal Company to induce the United States
to back up that enterprise and abandon the plan for
constructing a canal at Nicaragua. If by any means
the territory of Panama could be brought under the
control of the United States and our Bag be raised
there the victory of the Panama canal over the
Nicaragua canal would be virtually won. A waterway
through a country completely under our control
would be so much more advantageous than one
across the country independent of us that Congress
would hardly hesitate in making choice between
them.
Abundant evidences exist to show that the pro
moters of the Panama, project are making earnest ef
forts to have their enterprise taken up by the United
States. Some of the most influential papers in the
Eaft have .given expressions to opinions more favor
able to Panama than to Nicaragua and have backed
them by arguments of no little force.
The Baltimore American, after pointing out that
! neither of the rival companies claiming Nicaragua
i concessions has done anything to construct- a canal
by that route, recently said: "The Panama canal is
built more than a third of the way. There is no ob
stacle to the construction of it at any point along the
j route, and it is in the ; hands of a perfectly safe and

sand at night or in the early morning and leaving
the sand upon the streets so long as it remains moi<t.
That remedy works a double benefit, for it not only

T~^> RITISH military authorities have complete con
j â¢â¢ i over the telegraph lir.es connecting South
Africa with the rest of the world, and accord
can regulate the transmission of news to suit
themselves. They have established a censorship
which amounts to an almost complete suppression of
news, and as a result very little is known concerning
the progress of the war and the comparative suc
cesses of the two forces.
When a pre^ censorship was established by our
military authorities during the war with Spain the
British never wearied in pointing out the folly of
suppressing the truth. They condemned the cen
sorship with all the warmth and zeal of candid friends.
They informed us again and again that no such cen
sorship would tÂ»c permitted to British generals by
the truth-loving British people. Very quickly the
tune of the critics has changed. American censor
ship was mild in comparison xith the extent to which
the suppression of news has been carried out by the
orders of General Buller. and yet the British public
that was so clamorous against the American military
authorities is silent or impotent under the denial of
any comprehensive information concerning a war
in which that public is far more interested than it was
in the fight between ourselves and Spain.
What the British officials hope to gain by depriving
the world of any but the scantiest bits of information
about the wnr is not wholly a matter of conjecture.
It is very well known that at the start the conflict was
not popular. A strong party in Great Britain, com
prising rot only the Liberals, who were naturally
ed to the Si!i<;bury Ministry, but a host of men
of eminence in science, art and letters, was by do
means pleased with the aggressive tactics of Chamber
lain, and was engaged in an active campaign of edu
ction among the people when the Vtrfaoke out U
has therefore been felt necessary by the Ministry ro
avid anything likely to make the' war unpopular.
When Parliament was called together to vote sup
care was taken not to ask for an increase of
regular taxes or the imposition of a wnr tax lest that
â¢ :he taxpayers unwilling to prolong the
conflict. A victory would of co,:r-e -tirrnilate en
thusiasm and make the war popular as nothing ehe
: If the Government had anything like a vic
tory to report the news would be given out promptly
enoupii. About the only conclusion to be drawn
from the enforcement of the censorship, therefore is
that the British are being beaten. Why else should
the news be suppressed'
If the election tragedy in Kentucky reaches it,
threatened climax there will probably be fewer votes
to quarrel over at the next election.

PRACTICAL USES OF WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY
Bulwer, In one of his novels, takes his hero to a region. underground .where the

ables them by wafting the hand- to kill their ...enemfea . at. any
distance. It is a plausible- inference that he had. . at ; . the ..â¢â¢.time
he â 1 writing, some vague presentiment of wireless . telegraphy, and..- that
electricity was the mysterious force. The successful experiments thus far made in
wireless telegraphing have been in a narrow compassâ not more than forty or fifty
miles having been covered; but It la given out that Marconi will now endeavor
to "Send messages five hundred miles. lie believes that this can. "be done. .Â«nd :It
does seem that if a message can be sent fifty miles by. this process there ought to
be no diillculty in sending it farther, provided there Is some one at the other end
to receive it. - ' ..'â 'â â :'â 
Marconi Is talking of being able to destroy fleets In time of war., but man')' have
regarded his predictions as dreams. If. however, his invention can be perfected
bo as to send electricity to any distance and in any quantity, there does not ap
pear to be any obstacle to the realization of Bulwer's fancy given to. the public
nearly forty years ago. . . â¢ â

The now system of wireless telegraphy will be put to a practical use. for the
first time In actual war, by the British in South Africa. Even If :\\ floes not ac
complish all that la claimed for it. the invention is undoubtedly superior to any
methods of signaling hitherto available for military purports. -Its adoption by the
British War Be* for the South African campaign explains the hurry .call", re
ceived by Marconi at New York to return at once to England, and. nti . was
obliged to go without completing the promised, series of experiment* under the
auspices of the United States Navy Department. ; ' . '. .'-...â  '.".
There will be much interest on the part of electrical experts, and aU who
are watching the developments of the new system to see how far It can be- utilized
advantageously In connection with military operations on a large scale. Some of
Marconi's assistants have already started, for South Africa with thirty-tvro -sets
of Instruments, and others will follow. Marconi is represented as anxious to go
himself, but is held back by the directors for his company, for the very'good
reason that his life is too valuable to be exposed to dancers incident to the' cam

GIFT OF STOCK
NOT COMPLETED
Ivy Leach Gets an Ad
verse Decision.
Special Dispatch to The Call. . â¢
SANTA ROSA. Nov. 17.â An Interesting
case was decided in the. Superior Court
here to-day by Judge Dougherty of De
partment No. 1. The case was that of
Ivy I^each versus the California Safe De
posit and Trust Company .of Sari Fran
cisco, and Involved, the ownership of $25.
(XÂ«i worth of the capital stock of that cor
poration.
Ivy Ivoach. plaintiff In the action, live*
In Canada. She was the niece of the late
Mrs. rrUcllla Wilson, or. eccentric and
wealthy old !ady who lived in Petaluma j
end died In January of last year. When
the estate came to be settled up Ivy
Leach allrgod that her aunt had made |
h*r a prepont of the contents of her box '
In the *a{" dejxusit vaults, which amount
ed to $10.y>J in cash and the 225 shares of
the. stock In question.
Phe was In possession of both the Stock
and the caÂ»Â«h. but the former has never j
l*Â»en tranfft-rred on the books of the cor- j
poratlon. and It *as to compel this to be I
Cone that the suit was brought.
During the trial of the case much Inter
esting testimony was. introduced, and the
opinion wan freely expressed that while
the plaintiff hod perhaps failed to show
thnt her aunt had actually given her the
ftock. she had shown that such was her
lntrntlon beyond any. doubt.
The opinion of the court, as filed to-day,
decides that the stock remains the prop
erty of tbe estate. The fineness with
which the points arÂ« drawn Is well lllus
tratÂ«Â«d in the following extract from a
closing portion of the decision: â¢
"It must be admitted that the testimony
of the plaintiff. Curtis, and Mr. and Mrs.
Mills present* a case that. In the absence
of other farts, might be sufficient to es
tablish a valid gift. It Is when the rase.
ir.ade by plaintiff Is contrasted with these
other facts mentioned and contrasted
vlth her own conduct with reference to
the property, that the court feels that she
has not proven it clearly ami satisfac
torily. All the declarations of Mrs. Wil
ron are capable of being construed as ap
r>lvln* to a gift contained in a will. It Is
true sh< said. "This stock is for you.' but
tjo present purpose to give or any words
of rift or donation are used. The mere
rutting the stock Into her hands would
riot be sufficient- There must be a pur
pose expressed, followed by a delivery and
a partlne of all dominion. "

more or less. During the last three years
he had met him almost every day. He

land. .The latter said. "Now I've caught
you." to which witness replied, "Yes. Mr.
Coburn, I guess you have." "Oh, well,"
says Coburn. "that's all right."
At another time witness was going Into
town and passed burn's place. It was
beginning to rain and Coburn stopped him
I and asked him to assist in getting a num
; ber of bales of straw Into the barn, which
he did.
When asked if this was the whole of the
; conversation witness replied that It was.
He denied that on this last occasion Co
burn pointed to the sky and remarked
how bright the stars were shining, or
that he had acted in any way peculiarly,
He said he had told counsel and Carl
Coburn some things that were not true,
but that as he was now on the stand lie
would tell the truth and only the truth.
Counsel asked him if he formed an
; opinion as to the condition of Coburn's
mind from his frequent conversations
with and knowledge of him. Having an
swered In the affirmative he was asked.
"What Is your opinion as to the mental
competency of Mr. (.'.burn to take care
of himself and to manage his property?"
The answer was: "I think he Is all
' right."
This was more than counsel could
stand, and he openly charged witness
with having been bought by Cob's: for
the sum of $5.
The examination was dropped and wit
ness allowed to go.
TO INVESTIGATE

I Vancouver, has received Instructions from
I Washington to proceed at once to Re
public, Wash., to Investigate thoroughly
the case of Martin Everett, the man now
{ held by the Canadian authorities at K.uu
' loops. It is not unlikely that the outcome
of this ra*Â« will be a demand on the
Canadian authorities for the extradition
of Everett, as It Is alleged that he was
! brought over from the American side Into
j Canadian territory without the proper
ht-arlng on the southern side of the- boun
i dary line ...
It was alleged that Everett held up a
! stage near Grand Forks, and In order to
| *Â«ye the trouble there would be about
the mutter the American omcers simply
handed Everett over to the Canadian au
thorities, and It Is even said that the ar
resting officers disregarded writ of habeas
I corjÂ»tis and other Interferences of tho law.
Consul Dudley expects to set to the root
of the whole matter.

At the meeting of the Health and Po
lice Committee yesterday afternoon
Health Officer :.awlor presented the draft
of an ordinance recently adopted by tin
Hoard of Health which has for its ob
ject the regulation of cremation In this
city and county. Dr. LÂ»awlor explained

provides for a certificate from the Board
of Health, inspection by the Dlsinter
ment Inspector or other health officer,
and the permit for cremation, which
must not take place until twenty-four

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 1899.
NEXT SESSION
AT MILWAUKEE
Selection of Municipal
League.
Bpeclal Dispatch to Th* Call.
COLUMBUS, O. Nov. 17.â The executive
committee of the National Municipal
League selected Milwaukee as the place
of the next meeting. The meeting of
the league to-day opened with an address
by Professor L. S. Howe of the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania on "Public Account-
Ing Under the Proposed Municipal Pro
gramme." Professor Rowe said:
On the subject of public accounting the rec
ommendations of the committee deal with four
distinct 'Uesttons:
Firstâ The contents and aÂ»TÂ»iiÂ«;etnent of finan
cial reports.
Secondâ Financial control over receipt* and
expenditures.
Thirdâ Accounting of municipal industrial
enter;
Fourthâ Account of grantees of franchises.
In the management of public as well as pri
vate corporations the determination of official
responsibility Is largely dependent upon the ac
curacy, ready Intelligibility and unequivocal
character of the financial statements. The
hop<-l<-*(Â«ly complex r>-|" rtÂ» of such cities as
-New York make It Impossible for any one ex
cept an expert to ascertain the financial situ
ation .if the city. I*ublic opinion, unlnstructed
and nt a loss to form definite conclusions,
lapses Into Indifference. In order to remedy
this evil the proposed constitutional amend
ment and municipal corporation* act provides
for regular financial reports arranged In ac
cordance with forma prescribed by the fiscal
officer of the State. The further advantaee of
uniformity obtained by this system makes the
experience of every city readllv available and
constitutes an Invaluable safeguard against
blunders In financial policy.
The Comptroller Is given Indefinite tenure and
stands but second to the Mayor in Importance.
The accounts of public works should be com
pletely separated from the general treasury ac
count.
On the question of the accounting of grantee*
of municipal franchises your committee ha*
been anxiuus to secure to thÂ« city the most
complete data concerning the franchises of
public service corporations. To this end the
Comptroller is required to keep a separate rec
ord for each grantee, which shall contain every
Item of Information necessary to form an esti
mate of the value of the franchise.
Walter S. Allen of Bo6ton, speaking
upon the subject, "The Accounts or
Grantees of Franchises," said:
A prim* e-sentlal of public control of fran
chise companies ts an accurate system of book
keeping which will show every detail in such
a way a* to enable d. true value to be placed
at any time upon the business. In order to â¢â¢
cure this ii system of bookkeeplnt must be
arranged and Us ure. enf >reed by iÂ»ome public
authority, and in order to secure uniform meth
od! this should be drue. by State, authority
rather than by municipal.
The whole object of accurate methods of
bfiokkeepinjj and of public supervision and con
trol of the accounts of franchise companies la
to eecure a:i equitaMe division uf protlte among
the three parties interestedâ that Is, the users
of the tervjee. the Invert on of the capital em
ployed and the community at large.
The discussion of the topic was opened
by Dr. K. \V. Hartwell, secretary of the
Boston Municipal Statistical Committee,
who spoke on the financial reports of
municipalities, with special reference to
the requirement of uniformity. Dr. Sam
uel E. Sparling, secretary of the Wiscon- :
sin league of Municipalities, discussed
the same phase of the- subject.
"The Financial Control Over Receipts
and Expenditures" was the theme of A.
E. Crosby, former l '<;.â¢:â¢;.â  Auditor of the
city of Cleveland. Mr. Crosby said:
The necessity of financial control over In
dustrial receipts and expenditures haÂ» been
demonstrated time anil acaln In every muni
cipality of any tiz*. an.l the question is not
at this time whether such control should ex
ist, but how and by what authority should It
bÂ«Â» conferred and In whom should It he vested.
What Is want Is an ifbsolute, standard au
thority of financial control based upon a fixed
quantity and subjected to no fear of overthrow
so long an such authority is executed within
proper and legitimate limits. Such authority
can only be conferred by Plate law.
In order to fix the responsibility in ease of
neglect or failure to properly carry forward
the legitimate functions of a municipality
there should and must be an Individual headâ
one en whom may re?t either v ibllft approval
or public censure, and who must consequently
have the r<-iuisi;e authority to compel atten
tion to duty and ot>edience to rules laid down
for the rulJar.cr of all public officers In the
transaction of city business.
"Th* Accounts of Municipal Industrial
Enterprises" was treated on by Profes
sor C. W. Tooke of the University of Illi
nois. Professor Tooke said In part:
The prime purpose of municipal bookkeeping
Is Lo s>.-cuie sucoessful financial administration,
but we must rÂ«*cognlze an essential to this end
th.it the system of accounting should be de
*l*ned to give to the public thoroughly relia
ble, and Intelligible Information of the finan
cial standlnc of the enterprise from a strictly
business ; >!nt at view. A separate account
should be kept for each public service Industry
operated by a municipality. The adoption of
these suggestions would nvold thÂ» concealment
of the true financial conditions. All companies
operating under municipal franchises should be
compelled to keep similar accounts and to make
annual reports to the State authorities.
The afternoon was devoted to a general
discussion of the report of the committee
on municipal programme, looking to the
final adoption of the model charter, which
completed the work of the league for thin
session.
NAVAL ARCHITECTS
DISCUSS WARSHIPS
ArgTiment Over Efficiency of Some
of the Vessels That Formed
Dewey's Squadron.
NEW YORK. Nov. 17.â "Designs for the
Denver Class Sheathed Protected Cruis
ers." was the subject of a paper read by
Chief Constructor Philip Hlchborn, U. S.
N.. before the meeting of naval architects
and engineers to-day.
Walter M. McFarland. passed assistant
engineer, read a reply to the paper of
Constructor Hlchborn In behalf of Hear
Admiral Melville, chief of the Bureau of
Engineering, criticizing Constructor
Hichborn for selecting the Raleigh a.- a
â hip that might have been improved by
sheathing. Naval Constructor Capp.i, who
raised the Spanish vessels at Manila after
Dewey bad sunk them, supported Con
structor Hichborn.
Constructor Bowles said: "I have an
Interest In the Raleigh, and I am very
glad that she has some friends here. I
think that to select the Raleigh as an ex
ample of what might have been done by
sheathing is rather unfair." Constructor
Bowles Eald that if the Raleigh had failed
to come up to expectations it was because
she was hampered in other ways rather
than by a lack of sheathing.
Admiral Melville in his paper said In
part:
In rending over the Interesting paper of the
chief conilniclor_ "f the . navy on thÂ» D*nver
clays of cruisers, it occurs to me to Â«ajr that I
think ho need not have felt called ui>on to de
fend the design. Inasmuch as It m decided
upon after careful consideration by the board
of constructors, which had full knnvrledKe of
the needs of the denartment. and I ana sure
that "we all aj;reÂ« that the experts of this de
partment know the needs of the service and
how to nil them better than any newspaper
writer, however clever he may l>e.
I regret to notice some remark* on the Cin
cinnati and Raleigh, which certainly have a
tendency to create an /%rronct>us Impression
with respect to those V*l*. I>>t me nay that
the Cincinnati and ItaleipliLwere designed at a
time when there was a perfect craze, for hl*h
FlÂ»ril In all clasÂ«e* of vessel*. The statement
had been dinned Into our ears so much that
â¢we muit cet at least as rood results from
every !Â«hlp as were obtained from foreign ships,
and must. If possible, do better, that our de
signers were working, as one inleht say. under
the la?h.
He proceeded with a defense of the.
Raleigh as to her conduct en route and
returning from Manila. He thought the
efficiency of the two vessels named would
be improved if they were lengthened fif
teen to twenty feet. The meeting ad
journed for one year.

ASTRONOMERS CHAGRINED.
NEW " HAVEN. Conn., Nov. 17. -The
Tale astronomers this afternoon decided
to give up further observation* on the
Hhower of Leonids. Dr. F. 1.. Chade, ob
server, said:
"We have made several pictures during
our observation! of the meteors, but are
not sure that we have been able to photo
graph any meteors whatever. We think
that the shower must be over, and we
shall take no more observations at pres
ent. We have observed a large number
of sporadic meteors, but have apparently
caught no glimpse of the Leonids."

BRIBERY CASE
HEARING AN END
Senator Clark Placed
on the Stand.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HELENA. Mont., Nov. 17.â the Well
come disbarment caae before the Supreme
Court to-day the prosecution introduced
, about a dozen witnesses in rebuttal,
among them being J. H. Toole, State Sen
ator W. A. Clark and Governor Smith.
Wellcome, the defendant in the case, was
practically a lost factor In the proceed
ings to-day, and the scope of the exami
nation widened out into a general discus-
Fion of matters leading up to the alleged
bribery case of the last Legislature.
John R. Toole, a mining expert and for
several years In the employ of the Ana
conda Company, and said to be one of the
leading men of the Daly faction, was the
most Important witness. The prosecution
sought to show by this witness that there
was no preconcerted effort on the part of
the so-called Daly faction to defeat Clark
' for the Senate, while the defense on cross
examination sought to develop the exist
ence of a conspiracy or combination to
prevent Clark's election.
Slate Senator Clark testified and made
explanation of his business and other re
lations with the several witnesses who
testified to' his bad character yesterday.
Witness was asked if he had received a
check from Mr. Daly for $5200, and said
he had, but explained that it was In pay
ment for the sale of a newspaper in Madi
son County, which sale the witness had
negotiated.
Henry lulling, a banker of Virgnia
City, testified to the good character of
State Senator Clark. Governor Smith
testiried that the reputation of Clark for
truth and veracity was good. Judge
Parker testified to the same effect. Col
onel W. F. Sanders also considered
i x'lark's reputation good. Several other
' witnesses testified to Clark's good char
acter.
Andrew J. King. Treasurer of Flathead
County, testified to the good character of
Clark, but on cross-examination said he
had heard a great many persons say his
reputation was bad and that they would
not believe him under oath.
John 11. Toole was questioned as to the
charges that he (Daly). Whlteside and !
others entered into a conspiracy to spring
the bribery exposure for the pur; of
accomplishing Clarke's defeat. lie denied
: that there was such a conspiracy. The
, attorneys for the defense questioned the
witness on nearly every point relating to
factional fights in the Democratic party
and covering every political convention
during the history of the State. The wit
ness in a general way denied the exist
ence at any time of a conspiracy to defeat
, Clark, and thought that Marcus Daly was i
I not so strongly identified with the politics
of the State as was generally believed.
When asked about Daly and others con- j
: spiring to put $30,000 in Whlteslde's hands i
for the exposure and Clark's defeat, wit- ;
; ness said:
"I cannot find words too 6trong to re
pudiate that."
Toole denied any arrangement with
Whiteslde for ptMtijig up an exposure.
Several attempts wore made to Inject
tho polltii-il features of the State capital
contest into the case, hut the court dÂ»Â»
ci<ied that such testimony was irre;-
Two mor* witnesses are to be examined
to-morrow morning, and then an early
decision is expected. It is not believed
that there will be a:i extended arg-ument
of the case before the court.
FATHER YORKE RELIEVES
AN AILING COLLEAGUE
Takes Charge of St. Peter's Parish to
Give a Fellow-Priest a Needed
Best.
Rev. Father Peter C. York* has been
appointed pastor of St. Peter's Church,
'corner of Twenty-fourth mid Alabama
streets. The announcement of his ap
pointment as the successor to nev. Fa
ther Peter B. Casey, the popular pastor
of the well-known parish, will be a great
surprise 10 Catholics. According to Vicar
General Prendergaat Father Yorke's ap
pointment is but temporary, as there was
no other opening for him In this city at
the present time. Father Casey's cm
Unued 1:1 health makes it imperative that
he take a rest, and at the urgent solici
tation of a. number of his parishioners
ho will go Into the country to recuperate.
Father Casey has worked hard for the
past live years and has succeeded In
building' up the parish until it now is
considered one of the largest and most.
Important parishes In the city.
Father lorke will assume charra of
the church on Sunday next and will very
probably preach his initial s<-rmon on
that day. The mere mention that the dis
tinguished priest will occupy the pulpit
on. that .lay will crowd the sacred edi
fice to the doors. His fame as a speaker
is too well known to the people of this
State and every opportunity Is taken by
them to hear him talk. It is understood
that Father Torke, who is an old and in
timate friend of Father Casey, used his
eloquence to get the latter to retire for
a short time and try and recover his
health. Father Casey was at first loth
to do so, as he did not like to leave his j
parishioners in strange hands, hut the
Knowledge that Father Yorke would min
ister to their needs was enough for h'm
and he pratefutly accepted the opportu
nity of going into the country.
Manufacture of Acetylene Gas.

r?F YOU don't* believe It. go to the
II Doctor's Daughters' doll show at
j[ the. Palace Hotel. It Is a liberal
education to any man Inclined to
kick over the traces at dressmakers'
and milliners' bills. Just one ewift
lÂ«*p at the model dolls and all *111
become clÂ«-ar as mud to h!m. At a
glance, of course, he will be able to
take la all the frill? and flounces and
flares;, the pores and yokes and fur
below*; ' the spangles and bows and
fringes; the nete. ihe cunning little
bands, the ruffles and cascades, the
edgings and lares, the saucy little
dobs of fur and featherâ "the tout
ongsomble of the whole," as one Kreat
ptatÂ»*srflan hap" it. In the one rapid
survey' he can notice, too., the latest
agonies in tulle and chiffon and
taffeta and moupsefmeâ whatever In
heaven's name that is â and then can
pass swiftly on to the shroud eft. cts
and the ribbons scrambled in cream;
he can be carried from something
crriee to- fomething e^pe n>Â»t quite so
cerise, andâ well, when he comes to.
he can make bia* escape, thankful that
he ha* only to foot the bills.
To the ladies, of course, the doll
show is a fairyland of fashion, the
show-window of swelldom, with pur
ple end fine linen cut to the hour and
fitted to perfection, represented by the
doll slajrs. To the dressmaker ar.d
the milliner It is the yearly oppor
tunity to vie for the plaudits and the
patronage of the swagger set. using
their own pweet wills, pouring out
their . artistic souls as the fancy
strikes them, untrammvled by the
whims of clients. They are on their
mettle this year more than ever. The
result Is a. doll show bewildering In
beautiful variety, smart in every sense
. of the word, successful even at the
present hour beyond any previous
similar, display in this city.
The show is divided Into two sec
tionsâthe model dolls, dressed as lat
est fashion dictates. In maple hall
proper; the salable dolls^sd those for
â  raffle In what was marble* hall. Here,
too. Is the refreshment stand, pre
sided over by buds of this and last
year. From 10 o'clock yesterday
morning until 10 last night the shovr
was crowded with ludfes and chil
dren, many of the In: ones so
strictly up-to-date and so pretty that
they appeared to be models on a stroll.
The greatest interest, of course, was
manifested In the fashionably dressed

POVERTY CLOSES
NEW CALEDONIA
CONSUL'S DOORS
Honors of office as United States Consul
in far away New Caledonia have the
emptiness of a vacuum In the mind of
Paul Eugene Wolff, who has ' occupied
that diplomatic position from June of MM
until the lack of fees reduced him to pov
erty and closed the doors of his consulate.
Although the miseries attendant upon
poverty, and especially poverty found In
an effort to serve the Government, are
causing Consul Wolff considerable worry,
they do not bother him to that great de
gree as do his thoughts regarding his
right to become, a full-fledged citizen of
the United States by legal process, which
is necessitated through the fact that he
was not born under the stars and stripes,
although from youth to manhood he dwelt
within the confines of this nation. Consul
Wolff, held a prisoner In New Caledonia
through want of sufficient funds on which
to return, has appealed to the presiding
Judge of the Superior Court of. San Fran
cisco for legal advice and aid. His letter
Is now In the hands of Presiding Judge
I>aingerneld for consideration and will be
given Immediate attention.

SUPERVISORS TO

Trustees of the Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Animals
Strongly in Favor of Safe
Pavements.
Resolved, That the Superintendent
of Streets be and is hereby instructed
to sprinkle Market street fromGoldeu
Gate avenue to Second street with dry
beach sand at least twice a week dur
ing the winter months from Novem
ber 16 to March 31, unless otherwise
ordered.
Resolved, That the expense there
for shall be paid out of the general
fund.
The danger to horses on Market street
has been called to the attention of the
Supervisors. Resolutions wer*- yesterday
recommended by the Street Committee of
the board for passage providing for me
sprinkling of Market street with sand.
from Golden Gate avenue to Second
street, at least twice a week between No
vember 31 and March 31. the money to
pay for the sprinkling to come from the
general fund. Three members of the
Street Committee considered the matter,
Messrs. Algeltinger, Collins und Attr. .!*â¦-.
They unanimously approved of thÂ»-
Their recommendation probably makes It
certain that the resolutions will be adopt
ed by the Supervisor* at their nexi
Ing. and that the horsemen will SOOO feel
safer when they have occasion tv pass
over the city's principal thoroughfare.
This matter was first taken up by The
Call. Reporters were sent to interview
leamsleis. drivers of all classes, keepers
of stables and others briefly, represents^
tlve borsemeo. With one. accord and with
n<> dl.st^^ntlng voice they hailed the pros
pect of help whi<h The Call extended to
them to have the pavement made more
safe for their usÂ«-.
At the same time the officers of the So
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to An
imals were called upon to express their
opinion. Secretary C. B. Holbrook prom
ised to Introduce the subject lit a subse
quent meeting of the society, and sold
that he would favor any measure that
would save the horses from injury. Trie
meetings of the society take place only
once a month. A meeting of the trustees
was held Thursday afternoon. A discus
sion took place, and several of the gentle
men present expressed the opinion that
not only Market street, but, ultimately,
other streets., should be treated in some
way to make them safer. No definite ac
tion wan taken, but individual trustees
promised that they would ask the Super
visors to permit them to have an experi
ment tried upon one block with sand, and
also with salt water. Action will probably
be taken fore they have a chance to
meet again. It Is of Interest to know that
all the expression of opinion was favor
able to pome action providing relief for
the endangered animals.
The resolutions before the Street Com
mlttee of the Supervisors were introduced
Iby Supervisor Aigeltinger. He remarked
that streets In New York were sprinkled
| with sand whenever the conditions made
It desirable, and that It would be a good
thin* to sprinkle Market street during the
period indicated in the resolutions. Many
horses fall dally upon the slippery Market
Street pavement. The existing conditions
made it necessary to provide some relief.
Supervisor Collins spoke in the same
way. Els was aware of the dangers that
attend driving on Market street when the
pavement is slippery, and had knowledge
of many accidents due to that cause.
Concerning the proposition to sprinkle
th* Market strew pavement with sand, he
said: "I think it Is a splendid idea."
Supervisor Attrldge said that he thought
I it would be wise to try In San Francisco
I the sand-sprinkling plan that had worked
! successfully elsewhere The Market street
i pavement at certain times was dangerous
to horses. Jt was dangerous to human
beings also. He strongly favored trying
the remedy proposed to bring safety to
; man and beast.
Counting in all the teamsters and the
drivers or and owners of tine horses, and
of the thousands of animals used for va
rious purposes in connection with trie
; business and the pleasure of the city, also
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
i to Animals, the Supervisors will see that
â  they are not alone in thinking that Mar
ket" street should be made safer. Had 't
been known that the resolutions were to
be presented yesterday they would have
been advocated by many.
The trustees of thÂ« Society for the Pre
â¢ vention of Cruelty to Animals were pre
vented by lack of time, as explained by
Ur. DaJxfel. from taking definite action at
their meeting. Dr. Dalzlel Is a trustee.
Ho said last evening that he was very
plad that the matter had been put in
shape to come before the Supervisors. "I
had intended," paid Dr. Dalzlel, "to ask
permission of the Supervisors to have one
block of Golden Gate avenue, between
Market and Jones streets, treated experi
mentally. I am of the opinion that the
1 use of coarse sand would work splendidly,
â¢ and I am heartily In favor as a lover of
good horses of the proposition. I had It
' in mind also that salt water might bÂ«
used advantageously. Salt water makes
I the pavements sticky. 1 am convinced
; that coarse sand is Just the thing."
C. S. Crittenden. also a trustee of the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
i Animals, Is earnest In wishing that the
pavements may be made safer on Market
street. He said yesterday to a reporter
for The Call that sand is an excellent
thing to try: probably the very beÂ« that
could be used. Some of the trustees had
favored experiments with salt water, and
he personally thought that salt M .ir
would be of some benefit. It had been
advocated by some on the ground thai it
was cheaper than sand. The iHwiiseliiii
before the trustee* had been quite gen
eral. Not one of the trustees thought the
existing conditions were right, for they
all know that there were many accidents

WAR TAX CASE
SENT BACK TO
JUSTICES' COURT
Elaborate Opinion by
Judge Morrow.
United States Circuit Judge Morrow re
manded yesterday to the Justices' Court
the suit of B. Johnson against Wells,
Fargu & Co. Johnson refused to pay for
a revenue war stamp and the company
NfttMd to accept from him a package
for delivery.
Judge Morrow delivered a lengthy and
exhaustive opinion, from whicn are taken
the following extract* on salient points:
B. Johnson va. Wells, Fargo & Co.â This
la an action to recover damages In the
â urn of fifty dollars lor the alleged neglect
of the defendant, as a common carrier, to
receive and transport a certain package of
photographs offered and tendered by plaint
iff for conveyance and transportation. Ttia
case wait originally removed to this court
under the act of Mar. li 3. I&S7 -\ Stata.
112). as corrected by the act of August 13.
1&&S (25 Stats. US), and the Jurisdiction of
thlM court wrma Invoked by the defendant
under section 629 of the Revised Statutes
providing that the Circuit Courts shall have
original jurisdiction of all suits at law or
In equity arising under any act providing
for revenue. The court held that although
the court might have such original Jurisdic
tion of the cose. It could not acquire that
Jurisdiction under the act of removal where
it did not appear from the plaintiffs state
ment of his cause of action that It was one
arising under the constitution, laws or
statutes of the United States, and that
more than J2uOO, exclusive of Interest and
coats, was Involved. The case was accord
ingly remanded to the State court.
The case Is now here upon a writ of
certlorari, under section Â«43 of the Revised
Statutes. When the writ was granted upon
the petition of the defendant the question
of Jurisdiction was reserved to be further
considered upon a motion to quash the writ.
That motion having been made by the
plaintiff and also a motion to remand, the
question of Jurisdiction Is now before the
court for determination, and the solution
of the question depends upon the construc
tion to be given to section 643 of the Re
vised Statutes.
This section relates to the removal of
milts and prosecutions against officer* and
persons acting under authority of â¢ such
officer*, on account of acts done under the
revenue and registration laws of the United
States. â¢ â¢ â¢
It Is clear that the writ of certlorarl
provided for in section 648 of the Revised
Statutes Is not common law writ, but a
statutory writ performing the office and
function of an order of removal, and the
Jurisdiction of the Circuit Court to Issue
the writ and entertain the milt after such
removal is dependent entirely upon the pro
visions of the statute as applied to the
facts of the OSvM â¢ â¢â¢-.-,.
The first part of the section points out
distinctly the two clashes of persons who
are entitled to have certain suits against
them removed from any State court to a
United States Circuit Court, namely (1) any
officer appointed under or actinic by author
ity of any revenue law of the United States,
and (!) any person acting under or tv
authority of any such officer. The char
acter of the Rultx i* then described, and
removal limited to those units against the
officer or person acting under his authority
on account of any net done under color of
office or color of law. and on arc.unt of
any riirht. title or authority claimed by
such officer or other person. Clearly the
"other person" lnst referred to Is a person
noting under the authority of a revenue
officer, since only met) a person Is men
tioned In the first part of the section as
being entitle^ to have suits which may
Â»-c brought against him removed to the
Federal court. The fact that the revised
section Introduces the person actlnr under
authority of a revenue officer and gives
him the right of removal of a stilt aÂ«ainst
him and omits the "other person" pro
vided In the corresponding part of section
X of the net of March X. lÂ«r appears to
).,Â» a clenr sad consistent revision of that
section. Th.' purpose of the statute In *>

V. ARTISTIC FURNISHINGS.
(Concluded.)
If the general principles laid down In the
last paper be applied to the details of
house furnishing we shall nnd it neces
sary to vary frequently from common
practices. The first effort of a good
housekeeper is to keep dirt out of the
house, the second to get It out. From
either point of view carpets are unsani
tary, while they have the additional dis
advantage that they Involve the periodic
bus/bear, house-cleaning. Goo.) Boon are
now to be easily and cheaply obtained; if
properly painted or (preferably) finished
with oil and wax they form the best foun
dation for sanitary and tasteful house
keeping. Even when the floors are old
and rather defective the space around the
edge of the rug may be puttied and paint
ed so as to look very well. Often the
price of a handsome carpet would better
be spent in laying a new floor on top of
the old one. By rugs Ido not mean sev
eral little rugs, placed like oases on a
slippery floor or at a doorway to trip the
unwary, but good, generous-sized rugs
which will JuÃt escape the edges of the
stationary furniture around the sides of
the room, rugs which are substantial
enough not to "kick up" and yet small
and light enough to be handled by any
person. Rugs of this sort have the
warmth and stability of carpets combin
ed with all the hygienic advantages which
carpets lack. No such terrible upheaval
v the semi-annual housecleanlng Is nec
essary If now and then the woodwork and
pictures be wiped with a damp cloth, the
windows washed, the floors dusted and
the rugs beaten out of doors. They may
be had In all sorts of materials ready
made or may be made to order from vari
ous carpetings. Among the varieties may
be mentioned Japanese cotton and Jute.
Ingrain. Brussels, Smyrna, Axminster,
Wilton, Moquette and Oriental rugs of
many kinds. The least expensive, the
Japanese rugs, fade rapidly, though they
are substantial and come In charming de
signs; Ingrain, though more durable. Is
almost too flimsy to be used as a rug; but
anything from Brussels up will generally
give satisfaction In proportion to the
amount of money Invested.
If. however, the floor be too old and
poor to be made prt-sentable and a new
one cannot be laid on top of It, It must be
wholly covered. If one still wishes to
use large rugs the floor may be covered
with denim or burlap In neutral tints, or
with matting or woolen tiling. These
Bhould be lined with carpet or building
paper for warmth and softness. If the
rug be of proper size the floor covering
need show only about eighteen Inches
around the sides. This device, however.
and regularly laid carpets are only alter
nate evils.
All the furniture that Is Intended to be
movedâ that Is, which la not actually
built Into or fastened to the walls and
floorsâ should be easily movable and
easily cleaned. This at once precludes
the purchase of large upholstered chairs,
heavy sofas and tables. Wicker and rat
tan furniture, though not so artistic, Is
lighter and much less costly than antique
wood. With good removable hair cush
ions It can be made quite as comfortable
and far more cleanly than upholstered
plush and damask. The cushions may be
beaten at the same time as the rugs,
and the dust thus taken out of the house.
For bedrooms white enamel and brass
bedsteads and washstands are rapidly
superseding the old heavy wooden bed
room sets. Curiously enough, many
house furnishers still buy chairs by the
set, without reference to the fact that
the persons who are to sit upon iheip
are of various ages and sizes. Fairly
well designed chairs In hardwoods and
rattan are now to be found In the shops
In great variety, yet the prime test of a
chair Is whether It Is comfortable, not
whether It is ornamental. It Is not well
designed unless It be really comfortable
for somebody to sit upon. Dining rooms
and reception rooms may have rather
formal, straight chairs. The dining
room chairs should have rather high
backs for support, but the tops should
never have any kind of projecting orna
mentation which may Impede the waiter's
movements. In providing chairs, cush
ioned window seats and small sofas for
sitting rooms one cannot go amiss In
choosing such designs as will secure ease.
If furniture be chosen with these simple
principles in mindâ l. c. . freedom from
dust, minimum of labor for the house
wife and ease for those who are to use
Itâ there remains only one other way In
which to go astray: it may still be su
perlatively ugly. It should be decorative
by Its graceful form. Its coloring or by
the charm of the design upon It. Nowhere
is the principle of subordination more ap
plicable than In decoration; all ornament
must be wholly subordinate to the use of
the. object which it adorns. For Instance,
windows are for two purposes, to light
the house and to see out of; If a window
opens on an unpleasant prospect sash
curtains of muslin or silk are both useful
and decorative, since they shut off the
view and yet admit light. Hut If you wish
to see from the window, sash curtains
are an absurdity rather than a decora
tion. In the ordinary private house slab
orate heavy curtnin draperies are out of
place both for artistic and hygienic rea
sons. Wherever cleanliness Is an Im
portant requisite draperies should be
easily moved and cleaned. Silk, wool and
velvet hangings are only to be tolerated
when there is ample service to keep them
clean.
The facility and cheapness of mill work
and lathe work in wood has vitiated the
taste of Americans to a terrible degree.
Nearly all ready-made furniture Is
grooved, machine-carved and ornamented
In a way to violate not only the principles
of beauty. but of strength and cleanliness
as well. Ornament that Is meaningless 's
vulgar. In the room where 1 Bit there are
four chairs of different patterns, costing
from $1 50 to $15; all of them have legs.
Now. legs are Intended as a support, yet
all of these are grooved and beaded and
hollowed out in spots, so that twice as
much material as Is necessary to Insure
support ha* been used. The ornamenta
tion is not pretty, the depressions are in
evitably full of dust and the whole de
sign means absolutely nothing to any one
who sees it. By way of ornament there is
glued on the front crossplece of one large
chair a design in oak leaves. If these
had been carved upon a beautiful strip of
wood by the hand of a cunning workman
they would have expressed a man's
thought nnd skill. Ah they are, they sug
gest merely a machine and a glue pot.
Contrast with this gingerbread furniture
the plain, substantial colonial chairs, ta
bles and sideboards, made of beautiful
wood, almost without ornamentation, with
slender, tapering, strong legs, beautifully
polished by hand. There Is no reason why
machine-made furniture should not be as
well designed, and at least as simple and
dignified, as hand-made furniture. But ho
long as there remains a large class of
those who think that the more grooves
and oak leaves they get for their money
the more beautiful their furniture will be
It will continue to be made In large quan-'
titles.
Patterns of every sort, whether for car
pets, wall paper, drapery or china, must
be very carefully used that they may not
be more conspicuous than that which they
decorate. The floor and wall are the basis
both of color scheme and decoration, as
well as the background of the ipeople who
are to live there. Especially tn ordinary
small dwelling houses-, pattern* â¢ should,
therefore. bÂ« rather Inconspicuous. Indefi
nite In design arid the color tones either
neutral or rich in effect. If the cllmato
be sunny and the room well lighted, tho
walls and floor may he. dark and rich;
If the climate be. uncertain: : and often
cloudy, or the room badly lighted, thÂ» ef
fect should be light and jay. Color â ,Â» the
chief means of producing this result: thÂ«>
walls and. floors of ' living rooms shouM
be In soft rich brown, --yellow/ red. green
or warm gray tints.- Blue, thouih very
lovely when artistically used, absorbs th<Â»
light. Is cold In effect and Is seldom sat
isfactory for living rooms, while the blue
grays are positively chilling. Yellow In
paler or deeper shades, depending on the
lighting of the room, is uniformly cheerful
and satisfying; next to it rank the various
terra-cotta shades and the richer greens.
Neither floor nor wall ' covering should
have, large, striking designs, but should
rather. If having pattern at all. have a
wandering, indefinite design or small con
ventional patterns.
The furniture and decoration of bed
rooms can scarcely be too simple. The
wall and floor coverings may be lighter
and gayer than those of living rooms-
Blue and white or pale green and white
may be used as a color scheme for any
sunny rooms: yellow or pink and white.
for less sunny ones. One or two single
white Iron and brass bedsteads and wash
stands, a bureau. or a chest of drawers
with glass above, two or three low. light
chairs and a desk or tabl* large enough
to write upon, a hassock and a wasto
basket make ample furnishing. If there.
be a good closet Or wardrobe, a calendar,
writing materials, a warm dressing gown
and a pair of bedroom slippers and a
furnished sewing basket add much to the
comfort of a guest room. The rug need
only be large enough to cover the space
In front of the bed. bureau and stand. If
the floor be well matched and painted M
oiled. A bedroom should give the Im
pression of spotlessness and inviting com
fort; everything In it should bo readily
cleaned, and unless It must be used also
as a study or sitting room It should con
tain only strictly necessary articles. Mats,
bric-a-brac, superfluous fancy work, even
many pictures, are quite out of place.
Most buyers must take what Is offered
In the shops; they have neither the money
nor time, nor Indeed, perhaps, the taste,
to find that which Is choice and which Is
perfectly adapted to their circumstances.
Many of the most cbvlous mistakes In
such matters are the result of mere help
lessness In the presence of the dealer and
the manufacturer. So many very ugly
things have been made by man since the
era of invention began that one must
spend either much time or a great amount
of money to secure that which is really
tasteful. Unless one Is conscious, then
of a matured and cultivated taste which
may be safely trusted, it is always better
to buy plain, substantial, well made arti
cles; they at least will be only negatively
ugly. As one's taste becomes more and
more trained by observation and experi
ence, and the amount of money which Is
available for this purpose increases, It la
very easy to add more costly and artlstlo
furnishings. But If a mistake Is made la
the beginning in buying ugly things which
are rather costly, there is growing dissat
isfaction In living with them. Striking
patterns and fashions are safe only in
the hands of very well trained persons,
inconspicuous designs, soft colors, plain
surfaces are very seldom Inartistic. Sim
plicity, appropriateness and genuineness
are always safe. There are now to be
found In all the large cities a few shops
where expert advice may be obtained on
points of taste, but unfortunately the
goods sold In these places are often so
costly as to be quite beyond the ordinary
purse. Meantime the average buyer can
at least cultivate his taste by observation,
and as his Income permits may add to
the house furnishing articles not only
useful and hygienic but beautiful as welL

Bradstreet's Financial Rez'iew.
NETW YORK. Nov. 17.â Bradstreet's financial
i review to-morrow will say: Speculation this
w.-ek has hinged almost entirely on the money
markÂ«t and the development. connected with it.
I.h*i Saturday's unexpectedly bad bank state
ment, showing that the New York Clearing
house Institutions were about J2.700.000 below
the leiral reserve limit, created on unfavorable
1 Impression about the probable course of prices
at the opening of the week. Hut In place of
the expected selling movement the market from
Monday onward developed support of an ex
cellent quality, while at the same time large
supplies of funds c*me Into the call loan mar
ket. While rates touched I>>.. per cent these
were the extremes and the bulk of the bor
rowing at the Stock r?x<-hnnic.- was on a lower
I level than for a fortnight or so. Large amounts
were loaned at I per cent or less and the money
wjÂ»* offered In such a way as to Indicate that
the Intention waa to ease the market. The sen.
eral Impression, furthermore, was that there
i was a close connection between the appear
ance of these supplies of money and the break
of exchange rate* elsewhere described. In fact
It was understood that certain Institutions had
made large sterling loons and had use.l the
money derived from the Â«ale of bill* In the
loan market.
There was, It must be noted, little expecta
tion of cold Importations, but the decline In
exchange was a factor of considerable assist
ance to the stock market, which was more
j active and broader than It has been lately and
i generally advanced during the early part of the
week. These tendencies were of course lntensl
ned and Increased by the news made public
on Thursday that the United States Treasury
would buy $15,000,000 of gold bonds at the mar
ket price for the 4 and 6 per cent Issues. This
was almost unexpected, though it had been
stated that cert sin bond dealer* hayÂ« been ac
cumulating bonds In view of a possible call
of thla description, and among the reports on
Thursday wwoa o one. that this block, aald to be
some $10,000,000 in amount, would be promptly
tendered. Both practically and sentimentally
tbe Secretary of the Treasury's action had an
excellent effect and measurably dlaslpated any
subsisting' feeling of disquietude in regard to
the money situation. Prices therefore advanced
throughout the list, though one of the reatures
of the week was the extent to which activity
seemed to be confined to lower-priced atocks,
like aome of the Pacific group. At the same
time the higher-priced railroad stocks wie
not totally neglected, considerable strength de
veloping l n that quarter. London was a pur
chaser of our stocks, but the foreign Influence
on the. speculative situation was not at all
marked.
Bradstreet's on Trade.
NEW YORK. Not. 17.â Bradstreefa to-mor
row will nay:
General trade and Industry continue at a
maximum volume for this season of the year,
while prices, as a whole, manifest a strength
unapproached in recent year*. Strength of
values Is still most notable among manufac
tured textiles, but cereals, hides and leather
and manufacturers thereof have also strength
ened slightly. On the other hand pork, pro
ducts and tin are slightly lower. Tha great
majority of prices, however, remain firm ut
unchanged quotations. An active consumptive
demand for wool Is reported at leading mar
kets, accompanied by a fair export demand and
a further reduction in stocks,
Cereals do not manifest any striking change
this week, but the resisting power of the mar
ket is apparently greater, more moderate re
ceipts of Â«i,.., at the West Inducing some
covering, and corn Is sympathetically stronger.
Another feature naturally attracting attention
at this time of the year Is the active demand
ror coal, but generally reported small stocks
of coal available, both East and West.
lumber displays continued strenuth. and ad- 1
vices are of an expected very heavy cut this
winter, both in the Northwest and at the
South. Some shading In provision prices is
nn # ot v ' largely as a result of heavy receipts
of hogs. Sugar Is In rather slow demand, not
withstanding reiterated reports of the i>ettle
ment of the war among refiners.
The market for Iron and stÂ«el la rather quiet
at the East, but a heavy demand both for
plglron and steel Is reiM.rted at Chicago. While
export business has been reported checked. It
Is Interesting to record a very heavy order for
steel rods for export placed this week. He
Â»orts are also that a large foreign contract for
rails has been secured. Some shading In prices
of plates and steel billets in reported, but
bessemer plglron Is higher. In other metals a
feature has been a decline In tin, both at home
and abroad (partly recovered later, however),
while copper remains unchanged. In hardware
2. further decline In builders' grades Is reported,
but already some orders for next spring's de
livery are being placed.
Wheat, including flour shipments for th*
week aggregated 4,640.007 bushels, against 4,
650.842 t uÂ«hels last week. 6.679.141 bushels In
the corresponding week of IS**. 6,630.792 bushela

Dun's Reiiew of Trade.
NKW TORK. N", v. IT.â B r. Pun & Co.'s
weekly review of trade to-morrow will say: r
The signs of the Â«hrlnka*e for the new de
mand for Iron and steel products become mow
clear, and while prices of pig are maintained
without change and billets are quoted lower
only because premiums for early deliveries ,
are no longer paid, plates are quoted lawer at '
the East, with some "mall mills selling at 25c
at Pltt!<burg. and sheets are sold by some
works there at S3 less than the regular prlci-s.
Strength of bars at the West Is largely due
to the great demand for cars, of which It Is
said that 1000 per day are ordered, but at the
East prices are a shade lower.
A new demand does not make up for the
rapid completion of old orders In some lines, to
that competition of works weakens prices. In
minor details the collapse of- London specula
tion depressed tin to Me on Wednesday here,
but subsequently an advance of 4s per ton In
the foreign market brought the New York
prices up to 2$ cents. A sale of copper by the
Calumet .V Hecla. said to t>e of 20,(X)0.000
pounds, lowered the price to 17 cents. Spelter
is weak at i* â  with lead and tin plates un
changed.
Textile manufactures are doing well. al
though/In woolens the speculation In material
threatens to cause some embarrassment. Sales -
of wool were again heavy. 21. â¬12,311 pounds at
the three chief markets, making In two weeks
41.623.811 pounds, against 17. 437. KG pounds last
year, when the mills were v**Â«-ll employed.
Clearly a large â hare of the transactions has
been for speculation, but the mills have been
buying also, and especially those recently
started atler long Idleness. Prices are a shade
stronger for fine washed Eastern fleece and for
fine and medium delaine, so that the entire list
averages about an eighth of a cent higher.
Wheat declined a fraction, but fully recover
ed, although Atlantic exports were only 2,9?6,
:..'.l bushels, flour Included, against IVSWLIii
bushels for the same week last year, and Pa
cific exports 720.793 bushels, against 1.955.093
bushels last year. The course of the market
Is the more noteworthy because Western re
ceipts are much reduced, being only 5.837,867
bushels. agalnEt 10,337,311 bushels last year.
Corn declined a fraction with heavier exports
than last year and smaller receipts.
Failures for thÂ» week were 219 In the United
States, against HI last year, and 20 In Canada,
against 26 last year.

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO. Nov. 17.-Wheat opened V9\c
under yesterday. December at 66Â»;e66% and
May at T-j-,,:i,. The break In the Liverpool
market was the factor. That grain "center
weakened on the Argentine situation. The visi
ble of that country showed little de
-nTVhi" l Â£* ff K Cc of recent llberal Â«hlpmentÂ».
and there has been no modification of the orel
diction of a large crop. The market here how
ever, was not affected directly by the ' South
American conditions. The opening price was
under puts. The market rallied some on buy"
Ing against this privilege, hut the main sup
port came as a result of the small receipts.
December advanced to 67*6Â«r$ic and May to
.I{j.UÂ»c. a spread of 4Â«c between the two op
tions. It became evident that the market ha*
t>Â«>en over*.. l, l to some extant, a condition the
discovery of which added to the desire to cover
shortages. The early irain waa all lost late in
the session when It was reported that within
the next ten days boats carrying 1.000.000 bush
â¢ln of wheat would clear toT this port from
Duluth. Both options declined sharply toward
the end. December closing "iÂ©4o lower at
676674 c and May He under at 71Sc.
The trade was moderately active, a fact at
tributed by some to the crusade begun against
the bucket shops affecting: some largo Board

Harrison's circular says:
"During the week there have been three de
liveries of coal fnim Oregon. 19W tons: five
from Washington. 12,3!>4 tons; one from lirii:Â«h
Columbia. 2 1 7.". tons; three from Australia. 7W
tons; total. M.C7I tons. The xlim arrivals th:*
week are still further diminishing our small
reserves In yard. If our count mines do not
largely Increase their shipments, we may be
somewhat short of fuel for the winter months.
They can at any moment enlarge their output
to keep up with any possible demand we may
make on them, but the difficulty Is to find
transports for It. Carriers are not procurable
at the moment. The Government I* absorbing
a large amount of coal. Of course their urgent
requirement* must be looked after Ural this
create* a big deficit in our local supplies. Prlc^i
remain steady. The situation could easily be
utilized for an advance of values; so far. there
is no disposition to do so. This should prove
the banner year for our coast collier*. as they
sell all they can land here at lull figures, frcm
ship's side, thus avoiding yard charges. ' This
Is very evident. judging from the avidity which
dealers display on the arrival of every cargo
with long lines of teams awaiting their turns'
Australian and English freight rates on coal
for this market do not show any weakness"

near Carpentaria. The buildings and pip
lnc near the Los Conchas asphnltum and
oil iiiine* are being taken out. All of the

has been moyod lo the S:squoc mineÂ» on
the oiher tide of the mountains. There

The causes given for the abandonment
of Jhe lÂ«as Conchas and La Patera mines
is !hat the expense of mining is becoming
too great- to be protltabie. and also
that they. wish t<. put all th< ir energy at

EXCELLENT WORK OF THE
ARMY TRANSPORT SERVICE
TT~*EW people have any conception of the work performed by the army
M transport service at this port since the war in the Philippines broke out.
I The task has been an herculean one. but nevertheless it has been per
formed with promptness and dispatch and at no time has the dispatch of
troops bff-n delayed through the transport not being ready.
The lirst transports left here on May 25, ISf-S. They were the Australia,
City of Poking (carrying the California boys) and th. city â â¢! Sydney. Since
that time the different vessels of the Beet have left Ban Francisco 116 times
and have carried over 100,000 soldiers, besides 2.70.000 tonu of freight and
over 3000 horses and mules. Of course tho soldiers who came home from
Manila and their baggage are Included in the freight and number of men
carrini, but they all had to be bandied by the oflicers of the transport serv
ice All this mass of business has been carried to a successful issue In eight
een months; and many a weary night have the men at the head of the
service had to work in order to accom plish it.
The men who come most in contact with the public at the transport
wharf are Captains Batchelder. Uarn<-.Â«on and Matthews. They are all cour
teous and able gentlemen, and to them in a great measure is <Jue the buc
ctss achieved by the transport service. Everything of course is done under
the supervision of Colonel Long, and the colonel is blessed with able assist
ants. Messrs. Humphries and Lyman have done yeomnn's service during the
past lx mom and It li safe to say that neither of them wants a repeti
tion of the experience.

BROWN MUST CEASE
HIS PECULIARITIES
OAKLAND, Nov. 17.â Edgrar D.
Brown, whose bride of one month haled
him before the Lunacy Commissioners
last week to be examined for insanity
because he misrepresented his matters
financially at the time he married her. is
really incompetent to manage his affairs,
and If he Is Irresponsible when making
worthless checks and borrowing: money
without reason or Idea of when he can
pay back, he had better have a care for
his future transactions.

letters of guardianship over Mr. Brown,
who its her brother, came up before Judge
Hall again to-day for further luailrr.
and Dr. Webster, the family physician,

on the question of Brown's Incompetent
The doctor related many peculiarities ne
had noted In Brown, also that Brown's
mental condition had been brought about
years ago, when he was kicked by a
horse, and a month ago, when he injured
oil spine.
Judge Hall, however, was far from sat
lsfled with the testimony, and denied '.he
sister's petition, moreover admonishing
Brown to cease his Irresponsible flnanc'al
transactions, advising that should he con
tinue his peculiar course* he would be
promptly brought before the bar if a
criminal court. Th.- court also advised
Brown's relatives tfc cease making <ood
his shortcomings by coming to his relief

RAILROADS BUYING REALTY
ANOTHER tig sale of real estate '.=.
the neighborhood of thÂ« proposed
depot for the Santa Fe Company
was made this week ar.d, although
it is given ou: that the purchaser
intends to improve the property by the
erection of a - -.-.--â¢ to cost
160,000 and retain possession of the same
as an inves:mÂ»nt, the general belief
amor.g brokers is thtt the deai was mado
!n the '.merest of either the Santa Fe or
the Eouthera Pacific, as haÂ« been (he
case with a great mcjorlty of the recent
realty transfers In that locality during
the past few months. It Is a well-known
fact that the Santa Fe people have Lad
agents tjul'tiy at work ever slr.ee the uc- '
QUisition of the San Joaquln Valley Rail
road and the determination to build into
San Francisco gathering up all available
property fcr yard purposes. The South
ern Pacific Company has also been pur
suing a ".imiiar course and the supposi
tion is that it intends In the near future
:o extend its tracks to the water front
and remove its freight de-pot to a more
convenient location near the shipping â  â Â»
trlct. It is hardly too much to say that
very nearly every piece of property wuh
in naif a "dozen blocks of the .Santa Fe
depot site that ha* changed hands Â«.his
last spring and summer has passed into
the hands of either the Santa it or
Southern I'acif.c or will ultimately do so.
The sale above mentioned, uhlch is the.
largest re-ported for some time past, was
negotiated by Benjamin Guno & Co.. who

connection # It may be noted that ware

two dajs.
"Wo ran through as pretty a country

the l^ast trouble In gittlng rights of v:ay.

We do not look for any inconvenience In.

Mr. Common further sÂ«Jd that the new

New Ho;<Â» the Mokelumne : Klver Is
crossed Just below whoro it forks with

Engineer Compton said to-day that as

Colonel Thomas F. Harry has announced
that he will not accept the deputyship
tendered him by iMstnct Attorney Lewis
r. Hyinjrton and that ofllcial has decided
upon Livingston Jenks in his stead. As
si-mblyman James M. Hanley. who made
an excellent record at the last â¢ton of
the Legislature, Is slated for one of the
court appointment*, .'us also axe R. V.
WhitinK and J. J. Greeley. A. W. Thomp
son, who was yesterday paid to be Plated
as one of the Civil Srrvlce Commission
ers, will In all likelihood Just miss potting
that Job. as it is *aid by the Mayor's Â»up
porters that he has not been in the party
loiik enough to have won that distinction
and reward. It Is also said that A. S. Halli
dte and Joseph Urltton. who played
"hookey" from the Republican party dur-
It:k the campaign, and when sought for
wÂ«-re found whooping: It up In thÂ« Phelan
camp, will be rewarded with well-earned
political obscurity.
For Board of Education appointments
there are almost as many candidates us
there are principals In the depaxtmet.t.
President Jlergcrot has been laying his
wlr*Â»s for six months payt. and has at
every opportunity played as close to the
Mayor and his political connections as he
oould get. There are thnse. however,
who consider that he has played too close
to suit Phelan's new ideas, and they are
prone to believe that the board will Â».<Â»
made up from among practical educators
of lor.p standing in the city's schools.
Among those who are mentioned are Pro
fessor Joseph O'Connor of the Mission
Hlfyh Fohool, James Denmnn and Pro
fessor G. F. A. Herbst of the Cosmopol
itan Grammar. C. W. Mark, the present
assistant superintendent, would also like
to break In. but It is paid that tho first
named will have the call.
The chances that Charles Wesley Reed
will be chosen as chairman of the Finance
O<Â»minittt-e of the Hoard of Supervisors
aro about one In a preat many. The con
servative members of the brvardâ and
there ar* many of them â obiect to the
torchlight campaign he Is making: for the
place. Oomte, who has also been men
tioned, does not want tho position, and
has said 50. and thÂ«nÂ» Is a strong Incli
nation on his part and that of many of
the others of trie, board to ask either â
peph Tobln or H. I". Urandonsteln to ac
cept the leadership. â ;.-... not
as y*Â»t beÂ«Â«n consulted upon the matt
nor for that matter has Mr Brande
who. althoueh he would not make a flpht

HERO BLONDEL GETS THE HA, HA,
FROM THE GIRL HE LEFT BEHIND
MAT COLS, a blonde young
woman with high cheek bones,
was in the Police Court yester
day morning to admit that aha
had broken the heart of a hero. His
name is William Blondel and he Is out
now somewhere on theboundmgbosom
of the broad Paciilc greasing the ma
chinery of the transport Senator,
plowing its way to the I'hillpplnes'.'
Miss Cole turns absolutely cerise in
the faco when she speaks of him and
proclaims loudly that sho don't care
If he never comes back!
William Blondel was not a hero
whÂ«-n he first met Mles Cola. Ho was
only an oiler on tho battleship Oregon
before the pride of San Francisco
made bar famous run around the
Horn to adnHnTsTcr llie^ coup to Cer^
vera'l fleet. He was not a hero, but
he had the makings of one In him.
as hubsequent events showed. Ho had"
a big heart in him. however, and it
went out to Miss Cole, who. freph
from- Santa Rosa, had the bloom of a
pf-ach on her cheeks.
Blondel had small time for court
ship, for the very next day after he
had met his ideal orders came for the
Oregon to sail. To another man in
love this would have b*-en a grievous
blow, but, being a follower of the
B*a. his ardor was of the rapid-fire
order and Miss Cole capitulatedâ
that la, ehe admitted that he was
pr, distinctly the whole thing with her
that she would consent to draw and
use on herself half of his salary dur
ing his absence. Blonde) wrote her
out an order to that effect and, with

soon Hucceeded by anticipations of
the oodles of letters he was to receive
from Miss Cole at various Atlantic
ports.
The records at the Navy Pay Office
In thin city show that Miss Cole re
ligiously drew down six monthly
shares of Blondel's salary while ne
was oiling the wheels of war around
the Horn and Into the thick of the
battle off Santiago. The records of
the PoatoAea do not show that the

PLUNDERED THE
DEAD AT THE
PUBLIC MORGUE
Scandals About the
Coroner.
EVIDENCE IS ACCUMULATING
ELECTRIC COMPANY EMPLOYES
TELL WHAT THEY KNOW.
State That a Watch Was Stolen From
Body of L. C. Starr While Re
mains Were in Coroner's
Charge.
Storm clouds and scandals are gather-
Ing with imuHual rapidity around Coroner
Hill and his ofllce. The notorious lack of
respect shown by the- Coroner to the un
fortunate dead who fall Into his clutches
Is the leabt of the offenses that are
charged against him. Stork's rellecttng
on his management of the public enamel
house are accumulating dally, and each
(succeeding tale adds force to tlm Impres
sion of the community that the conduct
of the Morgue was never before bo dis
graceful and disgusting. It would appear
that a human vulture had fattened and
thrived by plundering the bodies of the
unfortunates whose remain! found a rest-
Ing place on the Morgue slabs.
Employes of the General Electric Com
pany are the latest to contribute their
testimony against the Coroner, and they
boldly and bravely stand ready to sub
stantiate all that they charge. In a bust
ness of the kind In which these men are
engaged there Is more than tin average
number ol accidental deaths, and us a
consequence they have had man) oppor
tunities of observing the methods em
ployed by Coroner tillL Their greatest
indignation arises from the mysterious
manner in which the bodies of a number
of their fellow workmen who met violent
deaths have been plundered while they
were In charge of the Coroner. Watches,
jewelry, money ami even clothing have
been taken from the dci*], according to
the- statements of the electrical company's
employes.
One case In particular In which the
workmen are extremely bitter is that of
l>. C. Starr, who was electrocuted by a
live Wire last March. Shortly before he
met with the accident that resulted in
his death one of his companions asked
him the time of day. He produced an ele
gant gold watch and chain, which at
tracted attention at the time on account
of its beauty, and was commented upon
by those who saw it. While his body was
lying in the store of ClutT Brothers await
ing the arrival of the Morgue wagon live
of his fellow workmen noticed the watch
again and remarked about it. ThÂ«y state
with itositlveneiM that it was on â¢:â  body
when the Coroner took possession of the
remains. That li the last any of the dead
man's friends or relatives have seen of it.
The day following the accident they
went to the Morgue to arrange for the
funeral and take possession of the man's
property. The watch was gone, and not
a trinket of value remained on the body.
They made Inquiries and were referred
to a burly deputy, who cut their conver
sation short by the statement that there
was no watch on the remains at that
time, and wanted to know what the
friends of Starr proposed to do about It.
Many other cases of a similar nature
have been reported and all are equally
revolting. It Is predicted that if Coroner
Hill keeps up his record until the end of
his term he will go out of oflice the most
disgraced and most disgraceful man that
ever fattened at the public expense on
the San Francisco Morgue.
A committee of the Grand Jury, consist
inK of John I. Wolf and Pierre Drydenl.
visited the Morgue yesterday to investi
gate the Coroner's office. The Jurors ex
amined the books of the institution and
found them to be kopt as they have been
by former Coroners.
Juror Drydoni said that he had not been
ordered to make an investigation. He
said be was chairman of the committee
that looked after the Morgue, and as *
number of complaints had been made h.
wanted to know the condition of affairs
as they existed. Ho expects th*Â» Grand
Jury to make a demand on him for a re
port on tho matter. Tho Jurors left the
Morgue without serins Coroner mil or
Dr. Zahala, The complaints of the under
takers will be taken up by tho Grand
Jury In a body. *

for Maternal Sympathy,
Killed Herself.
When Frederick Rippon railed at Mrs.
Dora Hawley's room early yesterday
morning he received no response to his
repeated knocks, and the door being
forced open the dead bod) of the woman
was found lying upon the floor. Her
burned lips and chin wore evidence, that
her life had been taken with corrosive poi
son, and a bottle which had contained
carbolic acid lying beside the body told
mutely, but no less tragically, the story of
suicide. ..".
The woman and Kippon had been living
In the France House, at 14 Third streot.
She was about 40 years old and ha been
divorced from her husband. Had health

cause of her mode of life prompted her
about tive months ago to swallow car
bolic acid.
At the city Receiving Hospital on that
occasion restoratives were applied and her
llYe was saved. She denied having will
fully swallowed the corrosive, and gave
the explanation that she had mistaken
the bottle of carbolic acid for a bottle con
taining medicine.
