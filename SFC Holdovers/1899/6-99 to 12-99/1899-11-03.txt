BOERS REMOUNT BIG GUNS AND RESUME THE
BOMBARDMENT OF LADYSMITH.
Britons "Wondering if General
White Can Hold Out for Ten
Days or Two Weeks Until
Aid Arrives.
LONDON, Nov. 3.â Special dispatches From Ladysmith,
dated November 2, give Further details regarding the
bombardment. The Boers, having reoccupied their old
positions, remounted big guns. Their Firing was accurate,
but almost harmless. Some oF the troops were slightly
injured by splinters.
The real question now for the British public is, can
deneral White hold out another ten days or two weeks
until the army corps arrives? Less anxiety would be
felt on this account were it not every day seems to bring
fresh lists of casualties, proving that much has been
concealed as to the real state of aFfairs, At the best the
coming week must prove a critical and anxious time.

at Ladysmith, telegraphing Tuesday,
"Dr. Hornabrooke, while searching for
the body of Lieutenant Clapham on T'm
bulwena Hill, which was in possession of
the enemy, met many Boers. On stating
the object of his quest he was kindly
received. The consensus of opinion among
the Boers, he thinks, is that they are
Rick of tenting and would like to throw
up the sponge.j They said their loss yes
terday was heavy and due chiefly to our
artillery fire."
All was quiet at Buluwayo, in
Khodrsia, according to dispatches re
ceived this morning, up to October
27. There has been some skirmish
ing on the border. Apparently ex
tensive preparations are in progress at
De Aar, Cape Colony, for the concentra
tion of Lieutenant General Buller's army.
Th.rjp.inas of mules are corralled in that

According to another dispatch the naval
brigade at Ladysmlth has mounted four

The report comes from Rome that Port
ugal, will permit the landing of British
troops at Lourenzo Marques. This coin
cides with the view strongly prevalent in
Eome quarters here, that the British inva
sion of the Transvaal will be made from
that point.

PUGILISTS READY FOR THE WORLD'S CHAMPIONSHIP
NEW YORK. Nov. 2.â With hi? skin I
heavily browned, his face looking
a trifle drawn, his eyes clear and
bright, James J. Jeffries to-night
nimbly stepped off the train at the
Pennsylvania' Railroad station in Jersey
<"lty.
Having exchanged greetings with his
friends the broad-shouldered California!)
walked briskly toward the ferryboat and
came over to this city. On his arrival at
the Twenty-third street ferry he and his
trainer Jumped into a cab and were driven i
to the Vanderbilt Hotel, where he will !
remain until 10 o'clock to-morrow morn-
Ing, when he will leave for Coney Island.
Aa Jeffrie? walked into the hotel the
comment on his appearance was favor- j
able.
Ills shoulders appeared to be broader
than ever, but his limbs appeared rather
small. After entering the hotel Jeffries
partook of a hearty supper and said that
he felt in excellent spirits.
The Call correspondent asked him if hi 3
I face was not a trifle drawn. He admitted
; that it was. "The fact is," said the cham
â  ; pion, "although I look thinner than When
; I fought Fitzsimmons, I am more solid,
. and strange as it may seem, weigh four
pounds more than 1 did when I fought the
! i Cornishman. I now weigh 212 pounds. ;
â¢ My li-^s and body are considerably thin
â  ncr than they were six months ago, but
I have filled out about the chest and
â  ! Bhoulders. All the extra weight I have |
â  gained has centered in those parts, and |
; as a fighter I know that is the proper i
! place to have extra weight. The best j
" j proof that I am right is that 1 feel so
â  I well."
"Do you think your battle with Sharkey
, will be a long or short one?" was asked.
"That is a hard question to answer,"
, ! said Jeffries, thoughtfully. "The length
> j of the battle will be determined very
. j largely by the tactics Sharkey employs."
â  I It was suggested to the champion that
â¢ I the sailor would likely pursue his usual
â¢ rushing tactics.
"Well, if ho does," exclaimed the cham
pion, "the fight will be over Inside of five
i rounds. Fitzsimmons used rushing tactics
j when I met him, and everybody knows j
', how hard he tried to knock me out, but j
i failed. Now Fitzsimmons Is a much j
j more clever man than 6harkey, and with !
! all his knowledge of ring generalship he j
! failed to accomplish his object, so what j
: eha-nee has Sharkey got? As a matter ;
; of fart, I don't care how Sharkey fights, j
; He can fight any old way he wants to. |
I will be prepared for him at any and all
stages of the battle."
"That's right," said Tommy Ryan: "and j
I'va bet $500 to $300 that you'll beat him,
Jeff."
"How about your ability to take pun.
ishment?" was asked. "Men who are
backing Sharkey believe that you cannot
take hard thumping."
"I don't know how they form that opin
ion," said the big r 'allfornlan; "I've bnen
hit very hard in all my battles, and yet
I I've never been knocked down. Fitzsim
mons gave me some pretty hard blows,
and he didn't succeed in doing very much

LORD LANSDOWNE
TALKS OF THE WAR
LONDON, Nov. 2.â The Marquis of
Lansdowne. Secretary of State for War,
was the chief speaker at the Cutlers'
feast in Sheffield this evening, the func
tion being attended by the usual distin
guished assemblage. Replying to a toast,
"Hher Majesty's Ministers." he went over
the usual ground in explaining the cause
of the war and defended the Government
against the charge that the military
preparations were not abreast of the ne
gotiations. He said:
"The diplomatic messages went by wire,
tht reinforcements by ship. Moreover, in
took a leisurely Btroll from Allenhurst to
Long Branch, along the ocean front, and
return. He then loafed around for a
while, joking with his trainers, and at
half-past 4 o'clock bade good-by to his
acquaintances and boarded the train,
leaving at that hour for New York.
Although Sharkey had planned to come
to the city to-night, he changed his mind
at the last moment and decided to remain
at his training quarters at Newdorp
until to-morrow morning, when he will
leave for the battleground.
Sharkey said that he did not think Jef
fries could take a good hard punch suc
cessfully. He said that in the only really
j difficult fight the Californian has had â
that with Fltzsimmonsâ he received only
j a few hard blows, owing to Fitzsimmons'
â  wild delivery. Somebody called Sharkey's
I attention to the fact that Jeffries had an
extremely long reach and asked If Fitz
simmons failed to get inside the big
Californian's guard, how could he (Shar
key), a smaller man, hope for better re
sults. Sharkey pointed out that he had
never yet failed to get inside the guard of
any man he had ever fought. He said
that he had successfully got past the
guards of such clever fighters as McCoy,
Corbett and Fitzsimmnns, and not only
succeoiloil In hitting them, but landed with
sufficient force to score a knockdown in
each instance.
Sharkey not only believes that he is a
much stronger man than Jeffries, but that
he can deliver a blow with much greater
force than the champion.
A comparison of the style of fighting of
the two men is interesting. Jeffries, who
is acknowledged to be the more scientific
fighter of the pair, assumes a low,
crouching position when in action. He al
ways keeps his left on guard, ready to
meet an opponent with a left hook or a
straight jab. His low position makes it
easy for him to move his head out of the
way of swinging blows. His footwork is
also excellent, in fact remarkable for a
man of his physique and weight. He is as
nimble on his pedal extremities as a light
weight. He hits straight from the shoul
der, and when he lands squarely generally
staggers or sends his opponent to the
boards. Jeffries' ability in this direction
was clearly demonstrated in his fight with
Fitzsimmons, from whom he won his pres
ent title of heavy-weight champion pu
gilist of the world.
Sharkey's style of fighting is very unlike
that of Jeffries'. The sailor is by no means
as finished a boxer as the Californlan. He
is, however, fairly clever, but in the heat
and excitement of battle usually forgets
hi# knowledge of the finer noints of box
ing. He is an aggressive, rough and ready,
"get there" sort of fighter. He keeps af
ter his man while swinging his right and |
left, and is not discouraged if he receives
a hard blow or fails to land. He will take
two or three blows in order to land one.
In point of physical perfection, no two
better pugilists ever fought for the heavy
weight championship. In former intes-ts
the question of dissipation and youth
against age has figured conspicuously, but
in to-morrow nlght'a battle honors are

order to keep abreast, the army and navy
would have had tn commit most provo
cative and threatening acts. The Boer
ultimatum followed British mobilization
and if Great Britain had mnhilized earlier
the ultimatum would have been earlier."
Lord Lansdowne explained the
promptness of the mobilization which
had enabled five cavalry regiments, ten
batteries and thirty battalions to get far
away on the sea. During the earlier ope
rations the enemy, he said, had great su
periority of numbers and choice of
ground. This phase of the situation, he
hoped, was approaching its conclusion,
for in less than a week the first install
ments of Sir Redvers Buller's force would
arrive at Cape Town, to be followed at a
steady rate by the iemainder.
"I do not think," continued the Secre
tary of State for War. "that there need
be any anxiety for the result. There has
been nothing in history to compare with
the patriotism of our colonies, who will
take no denial. Their attitudes will im
prtss on the civilized w*rM two great
truths-first, that Great Britain is not an
empty phrase, and second, that such a
large measure of voluntary support would
not have been accorded unless we were
fighting In a just cause."
In conclusion. Lord Lansdowne ex
pressed, on behalf of the Government
"profound admiration for the heroism of
our troops, who have rehabilitated the
reputation of the British soldier in South
Africa-a great gain, which to my mind
outweighs the heavy losses we have sus
tained, and outweighs even the sad dis
aster which was due to an accidental
cause."
Rear Admiral Lord Charles Beresford
replying to the toast, "The Imperial
Forces," praised the transport arrange
ments. Referring to the surrender of the
Irish Fusileers and the Gloucestershire
Regiment after their ammunition was ex
pended, he said it was an honorable sur
render. He expressed the opinion that the
Government was not sending men enough
to South Africa, in view of the probability
that the Cape Dutch would join the Boers.
Discussing the general question of mili
tary arrangements, he observed that there
were only two really patriotic nations in
the worldâ the British and the Americans
âbecause they alone had volunteer
armies.
THAT MULE STAMPEDE.
LONDON. Nov. 3.â A dispatch to the
Daily Telegraph from Ladysmith, filed
Monday night, giving a description of the
battle says:
"A similar mule stampede occurred to
Lieutenant Colonel Grimwood's column on
the Buluwan side. The ammunition was
lost, but our infantry quite h*ld their
own. It was a serious misfortune that
the Powerful's bluejackets were not sum
moned sooner, as the result of the en
gagement would have been different."
The Daily News has a dispatch this
morning from Ladysmith, dated Tuesday
at 10:30 a. m., which gives the first inde
pendent account of the cutting off of
Lieutenant Colonel Carleton's column In
the engagement at Farquhar's Farm.
The correspondent says:
"The column was sent out Sunday
night, made, a wide detour and reached
the spurs of the Drakensburg before
dawn. Colonel Carleton stormed the
hoights with the bayonet and made his
position against great odds, until his am
munition was exhausted and surrender
had become inevitable. Nearly 200 had
then been killed and wounded."
GERMAN CORPS' APPEAL.
BERLIN. Nov. 2.â The Vossische Zeit

committee of the German corps In the
Transvaal calling upon Germans to con
tribute to the support of the families of
"those German volunteers who have

The Hamburgische Correspondenz. in
the course of a semi-official article which
cautions "those who desire to embroil

"Germany is not going to pluck chest

Upon the subject- of receiving-ships
Admiral Crownlnshield points out the
great expense of maintaining such ships
in condition, with the result that after all
they are nothing more than floating
bouses. They should give way. he says,
to permanent barracks on shore. For the
health of the men, for sanitary
and hygienic reasons, for drills and
discipline, for economy of administra
tion . for the proper recreation
of the men and for reduced cost of main
tenance and repair and care-taking, per
manent buildings for the men should be
constructed at the larg_e naval stations.
It is estimated that should the c.angebe
made the Government would save $148,
--600 per annum. The reports show, as the
i result of Admiral CrowninÃhield's in
: spection visit to Europe, that not only
! England, but France, Germany, Italy,
Austria, Russia and Japan have con
structed such barracks. . Therefore,' it Is
proposed to construct barracks at the
New York Navy-yard, at League Island
(for the accommodation of the reserve
crews it !a proposed to. hold for the care
of the ships to be laid up in reserve there),
at Mare Island and at Boston.
Upon the subject of training of lands
men, the report states that the depart
ment was led to undertake this by reason
of a shortage of men to meet the demands
of the navy. It is hoped that in the
future the inflow of apprentices will be
sufficient to meet such needs, but mean
time the department -has been obliged: to
enlist several hundred young men who. it
is proposed to train for five or ten months
on board of training-ships. With .this
object the Hartford has been com
missioned at San Francisco, and with 850
young men will come around Cape Horn
:to the Atlantic. The Lancnstershire will
â  make a similar cruise from New York to
the West Indies, and the steamer Dixie
will take on 400 men from the League
Island yard for the same purpose. It is
calculated In this way to provide tor The
needs of the service for the next two 'or
three years.
The report calls attention to the failure
of the personnel hill as amended to pro
vide officers sufficient to do the work of
the navy. It Is said that there are not
nearly enough officers available to train
the men In gunnery. Had the course at
Annapolis been reduced from six to four
years, as proposed In the original bill,
this fault, the admiral says, would have
I been overcome. It is also submitted, In
conclusion, that the naval pay should he
equalized with that of the army corps,
and that the State militia be federated
into a national naval reserve.
BOLD ATTEMPT
TO ROB A BANK
Robbers Try Twice, but
Fail Each Time.
Special Dispatch to The Cntl.
VANCOUVER. B. C, Nov. The
steamer Miowera from Sydney to-day
brings a sensational story of the attempt
ed robbery from the Bank of New South
Wales In Melbourne of Â£10.000..
Chief Cashier Pearson was temporarily
absent from his desk when two men en
tered the bank, one of them asking the
sub-teller for change for half a crown. As
the teller turned to procure the change he
was confronted with the head and shoul
ders of a second man, who was half over
a wooden barrier with Â£10,000 In his hands.
The teller forced the thief to drop the
money and both robbers hurriedly left the
bank, but had the effrontery to return to
the bank within fifteen minutes and make
mother attempt to capture the money. In
this they were not successful. Two men
named Vergt and Harris have been ar
rested for the attempted theft.
FILLING STRIKERS' PLACES.
Italian Laborers Are Brought to
British Columbia.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Nov. 2.â A special
from Sandon. B. C. says: "The strike in
the Slucan country lias reached a crisis.
and the Silver and l^ead Mine Owners'
Association has commenced the importing
i f Italian laborers from Pacific Coast
. The ttrst consignment arrived to
ri,-, v !â > work in the I'ayne mine. The
striking miners are excited over tho arri
val of the now mine workers, but no vio
len^e was offered to the latter when they
appeared here to-day.
The trouble between the mine owners
and mine workers is of six months' stand
ing rind upon the adoption of the new
hour law, the mine owners reducing
.â â  ng^s from $850 to $3 per day. the
minors refusing to accept the reduction.
There have benn many conferences, but
neither side would yield, and the mines
have been entirely closed down during the
controversy.

PUGILISTS READY FOR
WORLD'S CHAMPIONSHIP
Continued From First Page.
easy as far as these points are concerned.
Jeffries is the bigger man of the pair;
he weighs at least twenty-seven pounds
more than trie sailor, has a longer reach
and Is taller by at least four inches. Both
men are familiar with the rules under
which they are to fight. The straight
Marquis of Queetisberry code will govern
the battle. This gives either man the
right to hit with one hand free, and on
the breakaway.
George Siler, who will referee the bout,
says that as both men have fought and
won victories under these rules, he does
not expect to experience any difficulty
with them.
The pale of seats for the contest has
been enormous, and indications point to
the largest assemblage ever seen aâ¬ the
ringside in this country. Every box and
half the reserved seats had been sold up
to midnight to-night. As tho managment
of the Coney Island Club is charging $10
more for box seats than was ever asked
for a championship battle in this vicinity,
all concerned will reap a rich harvest.
Tlie winner of the contest will receive
three-quarters of the 66 2-3 per cent of
the gross receipts.
It is estimated to-night that the
] winner's share would be about $30.00),
quite a snug sum for an evening's work.
Special trains for the ringside will bo
run on the eievated road.
Jeffries and Sharkey are scheduled to
enter the ring at 9:45 o'clock.
The amount of money being placed on
the fight, is, comparatively speaking, very
small. A prominent man uptown, who
is in the habit of holding a great many
bets, said to-night:
"There seems to be a lack of sporting
I blood, so far as bets go, on to-morrow's
: fight. Interest seems to be at fever heat,
' and yet men will not wager their money.
i Queer reports in the respective training
i quarters . f the fighters as to their inabil
ity to put v:, a good argument seem to
; have had a deterrent effect in the bet
i ting market To my mind both men are
lin the best possible condition. The most
conservative and well-informed patrons of
the ring agree with me that the contest
ants will have a hard battle for eight
round- and if it lasts longer it will be
a question of the man with the stamina
to win out."
AT THE LOS ANGELES
HOME OF JEFFRIES
I OS &.NGELES, Nov. 2.â While In this
oity much Interest is manifested in the
Jeffries-Sharkey light on account of its
being the home of the champion. little bet
ting has so far been done. Jeffries is fa
vorite but LosAUgeleÃ people want longer |
odds than those ruling In New York. For!
some reason Bharkey has a strong folldw- |
Ing but they are not putting up any great
Bums of money. What money bet will
pr bably change hands on the night of
the fight. The ruling odds are 10 to 7.
Some small bets have been placed at 5 to
4 The Largest bet so far reported is that
of Colonel Robert Kern, who placed an
even thousand on Jeffries against eight
hundred on Sharkey. For the second time
tills year the home of the Jeffries lam
il\ on Arroyo Seco is the center of at
tention on the part of the curious and
idle A S in former times Mrs. Jeffries
spokesman of the family. She was
n>-night and in answer to a question
Bald: "Whoever says I want my b

is talKing about. I did not want him to
enter this business. But since he has
chosen this vocation I cannot li^lp it. and
of course 1 do not want him to lose.

boy is not honorable. 1 have known men
who stood high in the church to do worse
things than Jim has ever don> 1 wanj
I him to succeed. Any mother would,
I would she not?" â 
The pugilist's sisters, Mrs. Southwick,
Mrs. Rover and Miss Ada Jeffries, with
ti ; .' three brothers, echoed the mothers
sentiments, as the entire family, Includ
ing Rev. Jeffries, desires that Jim shall
1 to-morrow night knock Sharkey out. The
; women folk do not have a very clear idea
of the preparation Jim has been making
as preliminary to the great .-vent. They ;
evidently are not readers of the sporting
columns of the daily press. T> y only
know that It is Jim who is to light and
I they want him to win. In tact, although
, they are shy about saying it, they know
In reason (woman's reason) that he must
win.
HEAVY BETTING HERE.
Money Flowed Steadily Into the Pool
Boxes All Day at 10 to 7.
The betting on the Jeffries-Sharkey fight
in this city lias been greater in volume
than on any light ever held in this coun-
I try. From all indications over $100,000 will
have been wagered on the outcome of the
battle before the gong signals the begin
| ning of hostilities. At Harry Corbett's a
I steady .stream of money poured into the
' strong box throughout the day. The odds
I were 1" to 7. with Jeffries favorite. The
I majority cf the small bets were on Shar
kÂ» y, while the big money went in on the
; champion.
I The biggest bet of the day and the
I largest ticket ever written at Corbett'a
i called for $?HiOO to $3000. "Jerry" Driacoll
j took Sharkey, whilf Henry Harris, the
basebafl magnate, secured the ticket on
Jeffries.
In the mutuels a total of 3099 $1 tickets
have been sold up to the present time.
Jeffries is most in demand on every line,
but is pressed closely by tho sailor. The
tickets sold calling for the men to win in
various rounds are as follows:

MANILA, Nov. 2.â Agulnaldo has
issued a proclamation announcing that
the American Congress will meet in
December to decide whether the "impe
rialistic policy" and "this bloody work"
are to be continued. He exhorts his sol
diers to conduct themselves co that Con
gress will consider them worthy of inde
pendence, and requests the priests to ab
ptain from politics and to redeem the
church from the bad name the misdeeds
of the friars have given it.
A crisis in the Filipino Cabinet Is pre
dicted as a result of the resignations of
Paterno and Buencamino, two Filipino
leaders who have lost tho confidence of
the rabid revolutionists.
Some Filipinos who attempted to come
to Manila with the Spanish Commission
received a message from Major General
Otis saying the women and children
would be given American protection, but
the men who had cust their lot with the
insurrection must remain with it. The
party included a brother of General Luna,
who was assassinated by the guard before
Aguir.aldo's headquarter.-;, with his fam
ily. ;uid the Filipino Secretary of the
Treasury. The families returned' to Tar
lac.
Lieutenant Slavens nf General MacAr
thur'a staff, recoimoitering with eighteen
wnen In front of Angeles, discovered a Fili
pino outpost in a trench. The Filipinos
numbered about forty men. As the Fili
pinos had sighted the Americans, Lieu
tenant Slavens' only course was to
charge, and his party rushed to the
trench, shooting and yelling. They killed
three of the insurgents and wounded sev
eral, who, however, succeeded in escap
ing. Not one of the Americans was hit.
The lieutenant secured valuable informa
tion about the enemy's position.
Thi- feeling of disquiet aroused at Iloilo
by the arrest of Santiago, the wealthy
Filipino who is charged with forming a
revolutionary Junta, has subsided. The
natives in their Quarter of the town were
BUllen and restless and were heard chant
ing the death song at night, with the re
frain, "The Americans Bleep." A provost
marshal's force Burtounded the quarter
and drove the suspicious-looking natives
outside the lints.
The Americans occupy Iloilo and the
adjoining towns of Jaro and ftfolo with
: en, consisting of the Eighteenth and
Twenty-sixth regiments, two battalions
of the Nineteenth regiment, a â¢ i.;-o'h
ment of the Sixth regiment and a battery
of the Sixth artillery.
The Insurgent force is now supposed to
be between 2000 and 6000 armed men and
many more unarmed. Their lines are
about 900 yards from Jaro, which is oc
cupied by the Twenty-sixth regiment.
The insurgents are reported to have five
smooth-bore cannon. For a long time
past they have been building trenches be
tween Jaro and their stronghold, Santa
Barbara, eight miles north.

POLITICAL.
CITIZENS 5
NON-PARTISAN
PARTY.
FOR GOOD GOVERNMENT.
To the Voters of San Francisco: The Non-
PartlFan party was organized Beven years ago
to wrest from professional politicians the con-
trol of municipal affairs and to separate en-
tirely from national politics the selection of
city and county officials.
It has at all times opposed machine politics,
and soukM to elect worthy men to ofnee toy in-
dependent nomination or indorsement.
The last Legislature passed a law expressly
aimed at the "unwelcome interference in
1 puhllc affairs of non-partisan organizations.
! The Rlckard act forbids any Information on the
i ballot concerning the Indorsements that a can-
! dldate may receive and makes It impossible for
â  a man tn"be nominated by two parties such
I a creditable occurrence as the nomination last
I year by the two great parties of John Lack-
! Mann "for Supervisor could not be repeated,
i We regard this law as pernicious in principle
I and against public policy, and we intend to
; vigorously contest It.
i the adoption of a non-partisan charter, tne
i result of the last primary election, and the in-
â  dependent character of the recent Republican
i and Democratic conventions, clearly Indicate,
however, that the friends of good government
i have awakened to their duties. ...,.*
With these changed conditions we feel that
there is no occasion for an entire Non-Partisan
ticket at this election.
It is however, a fundamental principle of
this party to support those nominees who have
faithfully and fearlessly filled their offices and
are r?nominated for the same office. "S\ c would
fall in our obligations were we to leave this
I work undone. *
We therefore unqualifiedly recommend for
your Suffrage at the coming election:
For Mayor JAMES D. PHELAN
For Assessor. WASHINGTON DODGE
For Auditor ASA R, WELLS
! For City and County Attorney-..
FRANKLIN K. LANE
To each of these faithful servants of the
people there Is certainly due a generous meai-
ure of credit and encouragement, for the able
and h.mest manner In which they have ful-
i filled their public trust.
i This committee, furthermore, realizing the
: difficulty for each Individual voter to inform
himself as to the qualifications of the many
I candidates for the Board of Supervisors, has
given careful and Impartial study to the rela-
i tive merits of the nominees on the several
! tickets.
As the result of continuous work by this
! committee, extending over a month's time, re-
i gardlng this Important department of the city
government, we feel Justified In recommending
for your support and vote, irrespective of
party line?, the following eighteen citizens, se-
lected from the Republican and Democratic
tickets, to constitute the first Board ot Super-

DECLARES THE FILIPINOS ARE
INCAPABLE OF SELF-GOVERNMENT
Commission Submits a Preliminary Report to the President
Stating That No Promises Were Made to Aguinaldo
and Praising the Work of General Otis.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 2.â ln ac
cordance with the understand
ing reached at the conference
at the White House yesterday
the Philippine Commission sub
mitted to the President the preliminary j
i report which It had promised to prepare, j
The report appears to be a compact i
summary of conditions on the Islands a3
j the commission left them; of the histori
cal events which preceded the Spanish
war and led to the original Filipino in
surrection; of the exchanges between Ad-
I mlral Dewey and the other American
commanders and the insurgents, and the
i breaking out and the progress of the
I present insurrection, and finally a state-
I ment of the capacity of the Filipinos for
self-government. A notable feature of the
j report Is a memorandum by Admiral
I Dewey explanatory of his relations with
j Agulnaldo.
The commission tells briefly how It con
ducted the task entrusted to It. hearing
â¢ statements from all classes of people In
Manila as to the capabilities of the Fili
pinos for self-government, the habits and
customs of the people and also the estab
lishment of municipal governments in
many towns. All this matter is to be
included In the final report.
Turning to the history of the islands
the commission attaches little importance
to the divers rebellions which had pre
ceded that of IS%. As to this movement
i hey declare that it was in no sense an
attempt to win independence, but solely
to obtain relief from intolerable abuses.
To sustain this statement they quote
from an Insurgent proclamation, showing
, that what was demanded was the ex
pulsion of the friars and the restitution
to the people of their lands, with a di
vision of the episcopal sees between
Spanish and native priests, it was also
demanded that the Filipinos have par
liamentary representation, rreedum
press, religious toleration, economic au
tonomy and laws similar to those of
Spain. The abolition of the power of
banishment was demanded, witn a legal
equality for all persons in law and equal
ity In pay between Spanish and native
civil servants. The commission declares
> that these uemands had good ground;
that on paper the Spanish system of gov
ernment was tolerable, but in practice
â¢ every Spanish governor did what h<_- saw
1 lit and the evil deeds of men In the gov
ernment were bidden from Spain by strict
presd censorship.
Allusion is made to the powerful K^iti
punan Society, patterned on the Masonic
order, and mainly made up ot Tagalos, as
powerful revolutionary force.
Ihe war begun In Lsyti was terminated
;by the treaty of Biac-Na-Bate. The Fili
pinos were numerous, but possessed only
about &*) smallarms. The Spanish f.-it. that
it wuuld require 100,000 men to capture
their stronghold, a-nd concluded to resort
to the us' 3of money. Certain conces
were also decided upon, including n pre
sentation of the Filipinos in the Cortes,
the deportation of the friars, which was
the principal question; the grant of the
right of association and of a frea press.
Governor General Rivera wat; willing to
PÂ«Ly $2,000,000 In Mexican money when
AguinaJdo and his Cabinet and leading
officers arrived in Hongkong. It appears,
however, that Paterno only offered the
latter $400,000, $200,000 to be paid when j
Aguinaldo arrived at Hongkong and the
! balance when the Filipinos had delivered
Jup their arms. The arrangement was not
acceptable to the people.
The promises were never carried out
and Spanish abuse's began afresh in Ma
nila, at one time more than 200 men being
executed. Hence sporadic revolutions oc
curred, though they possessed nothing
Ilk* the strength of the original move
| ment. The insurgents lacked arms, am
munition and leaders. The treaty had
ended the war, which, with the exception
of an unimportant outbreak, has been
confined to Luzon, Spain's sovereignty in
the islands never having been questioned
and the thought of Independence never
having been entertained.
The report then tells how General Au
gustine went to Manila as Governor Gen
! e-ral at this Juncture, and when war broke
; out between Spain and the United States
j Augustine sought to secure the support
i of the Filipinos to defend Spain against
I America, promising them autonomy, but
j the Filipinos did not trust him. Then
: came the Ist of May and the destruction
j of the Spanish fleet by Dewey, with the
resulting loss of prestige to Spain. Then
in June Aguinaldo came. On thi3 point
the commission says:
The following memorandum on this Fuhject
; has bean furnished tho commission by Admiral
i Dewey:
I Memorandum of relations with Agrulnaldo.
! On April U. 1698, the following cipher dispatch
was received at Hongkong: from E. Spencar
: Pratt. United Btates Consul General at Singa
pore: "Agulnaldo. Insurgent leader, here.

dore for general co-operation Insurgents Manila

; On the tamo day Commodore Dewey tele
graphed Mr. Pratt: "Teli Agulnaldo come as
coon as possible," the necessity for haste being
' due to the fact that the squadron had been
notified by the Hongkong Government to leave
the waters by the following day. The squadron
! left Hongkong on the morning of the 2r,th, and
1 Mlrs Bay on the 2.th. Apulnaldo did not leHve

IHE SA^T FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 1899.
Plnpaporp until the 26th. and so did not arrive |
In Hongkong In time to have a conference with
the admiral.
It had been reported to the commodore as |
early as March 1 by the United States Consul
at Manila and others that the FlMplni* had
| broken out In Insurrection against the Spanish
authority In the vicinity of Manila, and on
| March 30 Mr. Williams had telegraphed: "Five
j thousand rebels armed In camp near city. Ixiyal
to us In case of war."
Vpon the arrival of the squadron at Manila
| it was found that there was no Insurrection to
speak of, and it wns accordingly decided to al
low Agulnaldo to come to Cavite on board the
MoOuliorh. He arrived with thirteen of his
staff on May 19 and Immediately came on board
the Olympla to call on the commander-ln-hlef.
â  after which he was allowed to land at Cavite '
! and organize an army. This was done with the
; purpose of strengthening the United States
: forces and weakening those of the enemy. No
I alliance of any kind was entered Into with
i Agulnaldo, nor was any promise of independ
, ence made to him. then or at any other time.
I The commission's report then rapidly
i sketches events now historical. It tells In
substance how the Filipinos attacked the
Spanish and how General Anderson ar
â  rived and Agiilnaldo, at his request, re
' moved from Cavite to Bakoor. Saya the
; commission: "Now for the first time rose
the idea of national independence. Aguin
aldo issued a proclamation in which he
took the responsibility of promising It to
his people on behalf of the American Qov
i ernment, although he admitted freely in
private conversation with members ot his
; Cabinet that neither Admiral Dewey nor
; any other American had made him any
j such promise."
The report states that Aguinaldo wished
to attack the Americans when they landed
at Paranaque, but was deterred by lack
of arms and ammunition. From that point
"ii there wad a growing friction between
the Filipinos and the Amt-rk-an troops.
"There was no conference," says the re
: port, "between the officers of the Filipinos
and our officers with a view to operating
* against the Spaniards, nor was there co
operation of any kind. â¢ â¢ â¢ There
[ never was any preconcerted operations or
: any combined movement by the United
! States and Filipinos agralnst the Span
' iard."
Reference is made to Agulnaldo's de
mand that he be allowed to loot Manila
; and take the arms of the Spaniards. The
latter demand is said to confirm the state
; ment that he intended to get possession of
[ the arms to attack the Americans. Fur
ther evidence of the hostile Intentions of
the Filipinos was found in the organlza
| tion of "popular clubs." which later on
j furnished a local militia to attack the
! Americans. The decrees of the Filipino
Congress are also cited, as well as the
making- of bolls (knives) In every shop in
Manila. It is Bhown that a consid
â¢ erable element in the Filipino Con
gress wished to address to President Mc-
Kinley a request not to abandon the Phil
ippines iat this stage the Paris conference
was discussing the future of the Philip
: pines). The President was also to be
: asked his desire as to tho. form of govern
: ment he wished to establish. But all this
I time Aguinaldo was preparing fur war
I and delaying these messages, and it was
understood that the attack would come
i on the lirst act by the American forces
| which would afford a pretext.
A brief chapter tells of the lack of BUC
a attending the effort made at this
i time by General Merrltt, through a com
mission, to arrive at a mutual under
standing with Agulnaldo, as to the inten
tions, purposes and desires of the Filipino
people. This brings th>- story up to the
outbreak on the evening of the 4th of
February, with the attack upon the
j American troops following the action of
j the Nebraskan sentinel. The commissicni,
! in concluding this chapter, says:
After the landing of our troops Agulnaldo
made up his mind that It would be neo*;Â«i<ary
to flght the Americans, and after the making
\rt the treaty of peace at Paris this determina
tion waÂ« strengthened. He did not only openly
dw lare that h<Â» Intended to fight the Americans,
but he excited everybody, and especially the
military, by claiming independence, and It Is
doubtful whether he had the power to check
or control the army at the time hostilities broke
out. I">ei'lorable as war is the one in which
we are now engaged was unavoidable. We
were attacked by a bold, adventurous and en
thusiastic arniy. No alternative was left to us
except Ignominious retreat. It is not to be
conceived that any American could have
sanctioned the surrender of Manila to the In
yurpTits. Our obligations to other nations and
to the friendly Filipinos and to ourselves and
jur flag demand that force should bÂ« met
with force. Whatever the future of the Philip
pines may be thpre Is no course open to us
now except the prosecution of the war until
the Insurgents are rpduc^d to submission. The
commission is of the opinion that there has
been no time since the destruction of the Span.
ish pquadron by Admiral Dewy when It was
possible to withdraw our forces from the
islands either with honor to ourselves or with
safety to the Inhabitants.
The commission then takes the condi
tion of the country at tho time of their
arrival, comparing it with conditions <x-
Istlng at the time they left it a short time
ago. A vivid picture is riven of the nn
archy existing among the inhabitants in
and about Manila during the early spring.
"The situation In the city," says the
commleslpn, "was bad. Incendiary flr>-s
occurred daily. The streets were almost
deserted. Half the native population had
fled and most of the remainder were shut
in their houses. Business was at a stand
still. Insurpc-nt troops everywhere faced
our lines and thf Pound of rifle firing- was
frequently audible in our house. A reign
of terror prevailed. Filipinos who have
favored Americans feared assassination,
and few had the courage to come out
openly for us. Fortunately, therp wore
among this number some or the best men
of the city."
The report then speaks of the issuance
of the commission's proclamation and the
rood -effects It had on public sentiment.
The natives, accustomed to Spanish prom
ises, urged the commission that acts In
stead of promises should be givnn them.
As a result native law courts were estab
lishf-d. and this greatly aided in tho resto
ration of public confidence. The flow of
population soon bogan to set toward tho
city. Natives who had fled from their
homes returned. As showing the limited
scope of the rebellion the commission
states:
Wo learned that the strong anti-American
feeling was confined to the Tagalo provinces,
namely, Manila, f'avlto, Laguna, Batangas,
Morons;, Bulucan, Nueva Eclja, Principe, In
fanta and 7.amba!es. It was strongest In the
first six named ar.rt hardly existed In the lest
four. Thp population of these provinces Is es
timated to be about 1,500,000, but It should not
be supposed that even In the blx provinces Im
mediately adjacent to Manila the people were
united In their opposition to us. Even here
there was a strong conservative element con-
Bistlng of people of wealth and intelligence
opposed to the war.
Under the heading, "The Rebellion Not
a National Movement," the report treats
of the rebellion out of Oio provinces of
Luzon, where It Is stated the uprising was
viewed at first with Indifference and later
with fear. Throughout the archipelago at
large there was trouble only at those
points to which Tagalos had been sent In
considerable numbers. The machinery of
the Insurgent "government" served only
for plundering the people under the pre
text of levying war contributions, while
many of the Insurgent officials were rap
idly "accumulating wealth.
Ap to the state of affairs when the com
mission left, the report says:
Baton the commission left the Philippines
nearly all the Inhabitants have returned to
. ruined villages. Many of the houses bad
li-en rebuilt. Fields that had lain fallow for
three years were green with growing crops.
Municipal governments had been established
and the people, protected by our troops, were
enjoying p*ace. security and a degree of par
ticipation In their own government previously
unknown In the history of the Philippines.
Attempts of the Insurgents to raise recruits
and money In the province of Bulucan were
proving abortive, except when backed by bay
onets and bullets, and even in such cases the
natives were applying to us for help to resist
them.
The chapter devoted to "establishment
of municipal governments" gives In detail
the offorts in that direction. There wore
many difficulties encountered. The condi
tion of the people was found to be most
pitiable. They had been plundered by the
insurgent troops, who had robbed "them
of jewels, money, clothing and even food,
BO that they were literally starving.
Peaceful citizens had been fired on;
women had been maltreated. There was
prnernl satisfaction that the Americans
had come at last and conditions seemed
favorable to the American propaganda.
The towns of Bacoor and Imus were se
lected for the purpose of experiment and
4fter talks with the local "head men," a
local form of g-overnmfnt was established.
Encouraged by thr result, the work was
continued at Paranaque, Las Plnas and
other towns, with similar good results.
At the request of General Lawton, who
had been assigned to this work by Gen
eral Otis, the commission prepared a sim
ple scheme of municipal government,
similar enough to the old system to be
readily comprehensible to the natives, but
giving them liberties which they had
never before enjoyed. This scheme was
adopted and gave general satisfaction. In
every instance enthusiasm ran high be
fore the Commissioners took their depart
ure and cheers were raised for General
Lawton and for the country which he
represented.
The commission states that a large
amount of supervision over the affairs of
our new municipalities proved necessary,
as the officials were timid and slow to
comprehend their new duties. At many
of the elections the voters went about
"asking whom they would vote for," and
it was only with great difficulty that they
were persuaded to exercise the right of
free suffrage.
The commission sums up the situation
at the time of their departure as follows:
AVhen we left Manila a lurgre volume of busi
ness was being done and the streets were so
crowded as to be hardly safe. The native pop
ulation was quiet and orderly and all fear of
an uprising had lonpr since passed. An efficient
corps of native policemen was on duty. A
system of public sehon!.* In which Enitli. J h was
taught had bÂ°en advocated by the commission
an.l established by General Otis. Sume 6000
scholars were In attendance.
In the Tagalo province of I^uzon. where the
anti-American feeling- had been strongest, pub
lic sentiment had greatly changed, aB evi
denced by the fact that the military Governor
of HnlaEana-s had offered to surrender his
troops and his province If we would only Bend
a small force there. The Hlools, In Southern
Luzon, had risen agrainst their Tapalo mas
ters. The Macabebes wore clamoring for an
opportunity to fight In our ranks and native
Â» Idlers and scouts were also serving- under
General Lawton. Stories nf the corruption of
lnsurÃf-nt officers were becoming daily more
common and the disintegration of the enemy's
forces was steadily progressing. The hope of
assistance from outside sources seemed to be
all that held them together.
Having given so much attention to the
Island of Luzon, the commission then
takes in detail the condition of the other
islands. On this point it is stated that
the rebellion Is essentially Tagalo, and
when it ends in Luzon It must end
throughout the archipelago. The situa
tion Â« -lsewhere than Luzon is summed up
as follows:
The only Island, apart frnm Luzon, where
serious trouble threatens Is Panay, to which
a considerate- force of Tagalo soldiers were
sent before an outbreak of hostilities. Many
of the Vtsayana of this Island are opposed to
Tagalos, however, and It Is not believed that
the latter can make a formidable resistance.
In S;itnar, Leyte and Masbate the Tagalo in
vaders are numerically lew and are disliked by
the natives of these islands, whom the- have
oppressed. We were a^ured that 200 men
w.>uld suffice to restore order In Mandoro.
Bobol was asking for troops, the Calamianea
Islanders had sent word that they would wel
come us. There can be no resistance in Pala
wan. Satisfactory relations had already bepn
established with th<> warlike Moros, whose '
Pultan had previously been conciliated by a
member of the commission and in Mindanao,
this tribe had even taken up our cause and
attacked the insurgents, of whom there are
very few in the Island. In Cebu we have only
to reckon with the lawless element, which has
never been very formidable there.
Special attention is given to the island
of Negros, as this seemed a field well
adapted to the extension of an American
system. Here the natives had adopted a
local form of government. Including a
Congress, and had raised the American
flag. They believed themselves capable
of managing their own affairs and asked
for a battalion of troops to hold In check
a mountainous band of fanatics. The bat
talion whs furnished, but the people
proved unable to carry out their pro
gramme, owing to ill feeling among their
own ofilcials. The Americans remained
popular. At the request of General Otis
a new and simplified scheme of govern
ment for the island, giving the people a
large voice in their affairs, but placing an
American in full control, was put into
operation. It brought about satisfaction
and public order is better in the Island to
day than at any time during the last
twenty years. Slimming the failure of
tho native form of government and the
success of the American control, tho com
mission says:
The flat failure of this attempt to establish
an Independent native government In Negros,
conducted as it was under the most favorable
circumstances, makes It apparent that here,
as well as in the less favored provinces, a large
amount of American control Is at iirom-nt abso
lutely essential to a successful administration
of Diibllc affairs.
The efforts at conciliation with Aguln
aldo and his various commissions are set
forth in detail. These commissioners
were assured of the beneficent purposes
of the I'nited States, and the President's
readiness to grant the Filipino r-eople as
large a measure of home rule and as
ample liberty as was consistent with tho
ends of Government, "subject only to the
recognition of the sovereignty of the
United Statesâ a point which " being es
tablished, the commission Invariably re
fused to discuss."
The commission adds that nothing came
of the negotiations, as Agulnaldo's emis
saries were without powers and merely
came and came again for Information.
Courteous reception was accorded to the
insurgent commissions and earnest ap
peals made to stop further bloodshed, ail
witnessing "the spirit of patient concilia
tion" exhibited by the American com
mission In endeavoring to reach an
amicable adjustment with the insurgents
as well as the obduracy of Aguinaldo.
The report sums up the result of these
fruitless exchanges as follows:
No better proof could be furnished that the
primary object of this struggle Is not. as Is
pretended, the liberty of the Filipino peoples,
but the continuance of his own arbltary and
despotic power. In any event, the American
people may feel confident that no effort was
omitted by the commission to secure a peace
ful end of the struggle, but the opportunities
they afforded and urged were all neglected, if
not. Indeed, spurned.
The chapter devoted to "capacity for
self-government" is the result, the report
states, of diligent inquiry for several
months, 'n the course of which a great
number of witnesses were examined of
all shades of political thought and va
rieties of occupation, tribe and locality.
The moat striking, and perhaps ihe most
significant fact In the entire situation is
the multiplicity of tribes inhabiting tlu
archipelago. the diversity of their
languages (which are mutually unintelli
gible) and the multifarious phases of
civilizationâ ranging all the way from the
highest to the lowest. As to this the re
port says: "The Filipinos are not a na
tion, but a variegated assemblage of dif
ferent tribes and peoples, and thtir loyal
ty is still of the tribal type."
Concerning their intellectual capacity,
the commission said:
As tr> the general Intellectual capacities of
the Filipinos the commission Is disposed to rate
them high. But excepting In a limited number
of persons thpse capacities have not been de
veloped by education or experience. The masses
of the people are uneducated. Intelligpnt pub
lic opinion on which popular government rests
does not exist in the Philippines. Ami !t can
not exist until education has elevated the
maÃses. broadened their intellpctun.l horizon
and disciplined their faculty of Judgment. And
even then the power of self-government can
not be assumed without considerable previous
training and experience under the guidance and
tutelage of an enlightened and liberal foreign
power. For the bald fact Is that the Filipinos
have never had any experience in governing
themselves.
The report shows that this inability for
pelf-government is due to the old Spanish
regime, which gave the Filipinos little or
no part In governing themselves. Afier
reviewlng this Spanish system the com
mission sums up on this point:
Tills is all the training in self-government
which the inhabitants of the Philippine Islands
have enjoyed. Their lack of education and po
litical experience, combined with their racial
and linguistic diversities, disqualify them, in
sptte of their mental gifts and democratic vir
tues, to undertake the task of governing the
archipelago at the present time. The most that
can be expected of them is to co-operate with
the Americans in the administration of general
affairs from Manila as a center and to under
take, subject to American control or guidance
(as may be found necessary) the administra
tion of provincial and municipal affairs. For
tunately there are educated Filipinos, though
they do not constitute a large proportion of the
entire population, and their support and ser
vices will be of incalculable value In inaugu
rating and maintaining the new government.
As education advances and experience ripens
the natives may be entrusted with a large
and more Independent share of government,
self-government, as the American Ideal, being
constantly kept in view as the goal. In this
way American sovereignty over the archipelago
will prove a great political boon to the people.
Should our power by any fatality be with
drawn the commission believe the government
of the Philippines would speedily lapse into
anarchy, which would excuse, if It did not
necessitate, the intervention of other powers
and the eventual division of the Islands among
them.
Only through American occupation, therefore.
Is the idea of a free, self-governing and nnlted
Philippine gommonwealth at all conceivable.
And the Indispensable need, from the Filipino
point of view, of maintaining American sover
eignty over the archipelago is recognized by all
Intelligent Filipinos, and even by those Insur
gents who desire an American protectorate.
The latter, it is true, would take the revenues
and leave us the responsibilities. Nevertheless
they .recognize the Indubitable fact that the
Filipinos cannot rtiind alone. Thus the welfare
of the Filipinos coincides with the dictates of
national honor in forbidding our abandonment
of the archipelago. We cannot, from any point
of view, escape the responsibilities of govern
ment which our sovereignty entails, and the
commission Is strongly persuaded that the per
formance of our national duty will prove the
greatest blessing to the peoples of the Philip
pine Islands.
One of the closing chapters of the re
port is devoted to a tribute to
"our soldiers and sailors in the
war." The commission dismisses the
reports of the desecrating of churches,
the murdering of prisoners and
the. committing of unmentionable crimes
and say they are glad to express the be
lief that a war was never more humanely
conducted, saying:
If churches were occupied it was only as a
military necessity and frequently after their
use as forts by tne insurgents had made It
necessary to train our artillery on them. Pris
oners were taken whenever opportunity afford
ed, often to be set at liberty after being dis
armed and fed. Up to the time of our depart
ure, although numerous spies had been cap
tured, not a single Filipino had been exe
cuted.
The commission gives a general view
of the value of the islands, their general
richness in agricultural and forest prod
ucts, their mineral wraith and their com
manding geographical position. They
state that the Philippines should soon
become one of the great traders of the
East. Manila is already connected by
new steamship lines with Australia, India
ami Japan, and she will become the nat
ural terminus of many other lines when
a ship canal connects the Atlantic with
the Pacific. It cannot be doubted that
commerce will greatly increase and the
United States will obtain a large share in
this treatment. The report concludes:
Our control means to the Inhabitants of the
Philippines Internal peace and order, a guar
antee against foreign aggression and against
the dismemberment of their country, commer
cial and industrial prosperity and as large a
share of the affairs of government aa they
shall prove fit to take. When peace and pros
perity shall have been established throughout
the archipelago, when education shall have be
come general, then. In the language of a lead
ing Filipino, his people will, under our guid
ance, "become more Americans than the Amer
icans themsel\-es. "

man, George Dewey, Charles Denby and

WILL NOT GIVE
UP A MURDERER
Costa Rica Refuses Wish
of England.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
KINGSTON, Jamaica, Nov. 2.â The
Government of Costa Rica has definitely
refused to surrender Rutherford, the man
charged with the murder of the American
citizen named Archer unless the British
Government guarantees not to inflict cap
ital punishment, to which the Govern
ment cannot accede, thus closing the case
so far as Jamaica is concerned.
Early in 1537 an American named Post
Harding Archer arrived In Jamaica for
the purpose of taking up land and engag
ing In fruit cultivation. 'Jo all appearances
he possessed considerable means both in
ready money and personal effects. Archer
secured a property known as Elervale, in
the parish of Portland, a most valuable
place for his purpose, situated on the very
outskirts of civilization and reached by
a road that led no farther. As a compan
ion and partner in his venture Archer se
cured the services of a Jamaican named
Rutherford.
On October 22, 1897, the body of Archer
was found in an unfrequented spot in a
pool of blood. The body showed two pis
tol shot wounds, one through the brain
and one through the heart. There was no
weapon found, and the flannel undershirt,
shirt and coat were buttoned up and
found to be unperforated by the bullet
that entered the heart.
The body also lay face downward on a
Cile of broken stones, yet the face was not
rulsed. The effects of the deceased were
found to have been stolen.
In spite of these facts the police of the
district, after a delay of a week, set up a
theory of Buicide, with which they went
before the Coroner's jury. The Coroner,
who was the resident magistrate, refused
to allow such a verdict on the evidence
and the recorded, verdict was that "the
deceased came to his death from the ef
fects of two pistol shots, but by whom
discharged does not appear from the evi
dence. The circumstances surrounding
the death of the deceased are so suspi
cious we should suggest that the police
be instructed to Institute further vigilant
investigation."
In Junuary, ISOB, the Government for
mally notified the United States Consul
that "Archer had committed suicide. Mean
while Mr. Elworthy had kept up a lively
correspondence with the Colonial Secre
tary, pointing out the criminal negligence
ami incapacity of the people, but his rep
resentations had no effect.
Early in the present year there was a
shuffling of police, and one result was the
transfer to Portland of one of the shrewd
est and most active inspectors on the
force, Inspector McLeod.
In the interim Mr. Elworthy, a Justice
of the Peace and friend of Archer, had
quietly been carrying on a private inves
tigation with a view to the ultimate clear
ing of the memory of his friend from the i
stain of suicide and to bring the murderer i
to justice. He placed the results in the !
hands of McLeod, and after considering i
them that officer united with Mr. El- !
worthy in urging the Government to order
a reopening of the inquiry.
This was done. Rutherford, who Imme
diately after the holding of the inquest
disappeared from the island, was located
In Costa Rica, where he was arrested on
an extradition warrant from the Jamaican
Government.

STRIKERS' TRIM
NEARING A CLOSE
Prosecution Has Put in
All Evidence.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MOSCOW, Idaho, Nov. 2.â ln the trial
of the Coeur d'Alene miners, for interfer
ing with the mails, the prosecution closed
its case at noon yesterday. During the
proceedings the defense made a motion
to strike out all the testimony by wit
nesses who had testified before the Coro
ner's Jury on the death of Smith and
Chevne the men who were killed on April
29 the day of the alleged obstruction of
the malls. The ground taken was that
the defense had been refused access to
the records of this proceeding, and there
fore the defendants were deprived of the
opportunity to use evidence given prior to
the present testimony for purposes of im
peachment. It was maintained that if
the records were on hand they anticipated
no trouble in showing that some of the
witnesses were false or mistaken in the
statements made in the court. The de
fense introduced ten witnesses who at
tempted to prove alibis for cue prisoners.
To-day many witnesses were introduced
by the defense and the testimony was pre
sented to show that all the prisoners ex
cept one were engaged in other business
and were not present when the mill was
blown up and that they were not a part
of the mob that delayed the mail train.
The defense will put three more wit
nesses on the stand to-morrow and this
will finish the evidence.

ROSINANTE
CAME HOME
ON THE BIT
The Chestnut Mare Displayed
Rare Form â Satsuma
a Bad Ac'Or-
> If her race of yesterday at Oakland is
) any criterion, the dainty Rosinante will
Â» be a strong factor in the purse events and
I | handicaps to be contested for during the
' ! season now in progress. Formerly, she
| ; had the reputation of being a stretch run
â¢ ! tier, but in the mile and a sixteenth sell
| i ing affair the chestnut mare picked up
J ' 104 pounds, and, after making all the pace,
[ ! won easily in 1:47V4, over a slow track. It
| was a remarkably fine performance. In i
! | the betting 6 to 5 was laid about her j
> | around post time. Satsuma was a starter j
i ! in the race, ruling a strong second choice.
v ; At the post Dr. Rowell's horse delayed
i ; the start some minutes, kicking at any
[ thing and everything in sight, as well as
' ' refusing to break. Finally his blinkers
1 were removed, and he sailed away with
I i the field. Running In second position un-
I til over a furlong from the start, he then
I began to tire, and was beaten out lor
. â  the place by Plan, a 12 to 1 shot.
. The card was better than an average
' one, and the attendance large. First
' ! choices made a stand off of it, taking ;
I i three purses. Tommy Burns and JacK |
I i Ward each piloted two winners.
I ; No doubt the most unexpected happen-
I ] ing of the afternoon was the defeat of the
1 to 3 choice Rosormonde, with Piggott
1 I up, by Chihuahua, a 10 to 1 outsider, rid
-1 : den by Thorpe. The latter was In front
Â» when a quarter had been covered, and In j
I a long, punishing drive, got the verdict
i by the shortest of heads, In the fast time
;of 1:01 Vs. Sallie Goodwin led six others
over the line foi third place.
1 The Echo was installed favorite for the
> I two-year-old sprint over the Futurity
I i course, which opened the racing. The Ar
l I tillery filly had considerable speed in the
I first stages of the running, but tired as
. ! the stretch was neared. Daniel, the sec- t
' end choice, with Ward in the saddle, then
1 : disposed of Aborigine, with pounds to
1 spare.
> Tiburon looked the best of the five
I starters in the dash following, closing a
i ' pronounced choice. Tommy Burns had the
, leg up, and breaking in front, won in rag
! time from Jack Met 'a!..'. O'Connor, the
i second choice, ran an indifferent third.
1 i The free handicap, at seven furlongs, !
i I proved a Cakewalk for Faversham, the
i 8 to 5 choice. His 110 pounds did not
i : bother the black horse any more than a i
i mosquito bite, for he cantered home two
lengths in advance of Lodestar. With 125
1 pounds in the saddle, Wyoming ran like
a scuttled ship.
1 j Tommy Burns was again very much in
evidence when the closing mile soiling
handicap was called. He tossed the leg!
over Monrovia, an 8 to 1 shot, winning all
I the way. Dr. Bernays," the 7 to 10 favorite, i
I had a sturdy following, but betrayed his :
friends, running second in slow time.
Lothian finished a close third.

DIXON IS
GIVEN THE
DECISION
Splendid, Game Fight With
Curley, the i: nglish
Featherweight.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Nov. 2.â George Dixon, j
feather-weight champion of the world,
more than held his own to-night against
Will Curley of England, and after fighting
I twenty-live rounds, many of which were
I rather tame, the American was declared
I the winner and no one complained.
Curley is a clever, game boy, but Dixon
is a little bit cleverer and none the less
game. Dixon's victory was well earned
and by his defeat of Curley he re-estab
lishes what has always been claimed, that
he is the superior of Jordan. Palmer and
all Englishmen who have been defeated
by Curley. Curley has no excuse to make
for his defeat to-night other than that he
was outclassed. Dixon was a big favorite,
as much as 100 to 30 being wagered on
him. Before the Englishman donned the
gloves he demanded an assurance that the
purse of $4500 was guaranteed.
In the opening round Curley shot two
hard lefts into Dixon's mouth. Dixon
swung lefts on body and head. There were
light exchanges in the second round, and
in the third Curley had the better of the
fighting, though Dixon was the aggressor
at. the opening. Curley planted a terrific
right straight over Dixon's heart.
Dixon forced matters In the fourth, but
Curley was very clever In dodging his as
saults, ami rurley's blocKlng was almost
perfect.
'The fifth round was Dixon's. He brought
Curley to his tiptoes with a hard left In
the stomach. Curley weakened and Dixon
bored in with a right on* jaw. Curley
clinched, but Dixon fought him off, send
ing In hard ones on the wind and was
forcing Curley all over the ring when the
gong sounded.
Dixon continued his rushing In the
sixth, landing a hard right over the ear.
Curley landed a right on the body, right
on the ribs and, just before the bell put a
stop to the round, a left on Dixon's nead.
Dixon bored in In the seventh, landing
his left on the jaw and right on wind. ;
Curley blocked prettily, but landed only
onceâ a left on the body.
A straight lefi and a left hook sent j
Curley' a head back in the eighth. Curley |
was cautioned for "mugging" in a clinch, i
Near the end of the round Curley put '
straight lefts on the face and sent his
right on the jaw In a breakaway.
in the ninth Curley put his left to i
George's eye and landed a triple chopping !
blow on the chest, neck and head. Dixon !
rushed amj met with right on the body, ;
nd right on the face and right on i
wind. Curley was cautioned again for
"mugging."
Curley opened the tenth with a right to
the ribs and ;i left chop on the ear. Dixon j
put a hard Wt on the stomach, which i
made Curley wince. Dixon landed several
light body blows and Curley put a hard
right on the eye. Dixon failed to laini In
the eleventh until the bell rang and was!
evidently willing to let Curley tire himself j
by continuous leading. Curley landed a '
I right jolt on the body.
George opened the twelfth with a sting-
Ing left swing on the ear. Several light j
angea followed, and In close quarters!
George planted bis right on the body and '
hooked his left to the head, dropping
Curley to the floor. The Englishman
struggled to regain his feet, but the bell i
saved him after three seconds.
Curh-y came up groggy in the thirteenth
and Dixon fought to finish him. but Cur
ley improved fast. He put a left to Dix- j
fact and body and right over the '
i heart, and was in good condition at the !
I bell.
lii the fourteenth Curley put a straight
left to Dixon'B face and George put two
rights to the Jaw.
Cur!. . i . ! the fifteenth with a left
to face and Dixon jabbed left to Curley's
right eye, which was swollen from Cur
fall In the twelfth. Dlxon landed a
hard left on the stomach that seemed to
cause Curley great pain.
The exchanges in the sixteenth were
light. Curley struck Dixon from a clinch,
but immediately apologised.
The seventeenth, eighteenth and ntne
rounds were tame. Both men were
tired, Curley more so than Dlxon. Cur
ley made ;>n effort in the twentieth, get
, ting his left to the body, and though
Dlxon kept going to his man, his efforts
were Ineffective.
Dixon had a shade thp better of the
twenty-flnrt, but Curley put a left hook
to the jaw find woke Dixon up.
Curley began the twenty-second with a
rl^ht drive to Dixon's body. Dixon looked
, but hlfl expression did not scare
the ''.riton. who blocked and gnarded
;. H>- chopped a left to Dixon's
face and George sent a right to the body.
in the twenty-third Curley got his right
over to Dixon's jaw hard, but after this
effort his defense weakened. At the close
of the round Dixon landed a blow in the
wind that mnde Curley vomit as he went
to his corner.

Good Catches Made by
All the Vessels.
MORE MILLIONS FROM NOME
PORTLAND HERE WITH THREE
HUNDRED MINERS.
Charles W. Morgan Arrives From
Okhotsk Sea â Found Sixty-
Pounds of Anibergrii Dur
ing the Cruise.
Another vessel of the Alaska Commer
cial Company's fleet arrived from Cape
Nome, tit. Michael and Unalaska yester
day. Shortly alter daybreak the Portland,
wilh 304 returning miners, put in an ap
pearance and waa ducked at Fremont
street wharf. There was aboard ten
boxes of gold dust, each valued at about
Jlixi, UtKJ, for the company, and each miner
had all the way from $200 to $StWO worth
of dust in his possession.
Among those who came down on the
Portland was J. A. Dexter, who has been
on the Yukon and at Cape Nome since
1890. lie has done remarkably well and Is
considered one ol the wealthiest men that
has left the Â«oiu lields this year. Some
time ago he injured his knee, and li is
for a surgical operation thai he has come
to San Francisco. Â±Ie is accompanied by
his wife, who Is an Indian woman, and
his two ehliaren.
Louis siloss Jr. also returned on the
Portland. He has been on the- different
gold iieids for several months, looking
after the vast Interests of toe *. ummercial
Company, tie is in good health, but is
very much thinner man when he left
San Francisco.
The crew ot the Portland confirm the
stories ot typhoid fever, and some of the
passengers " were sick with vne disease
when they left Cape Nome. James K.
Girling, wnose death was reported by the
RoanoKe, passed away on the Portland in
Unalaska Harbor, lie was taken aboard
suffering from typhoid. There were ten
other fever patients on the Portland when
she left Nome, but five of them recovered
sufficiently during the passage to be able
to leave the ship when she docked. The
others were removed to the various hos
pitals during the day. The steamer was
examined by the quarantine officer, but
after a searching investigation into the
cases he allowed her to go to her wharf.
Captain Lundquist reports that the
steamers Cleveland. Alona and Albion,
the schooner Vega and bark Alaska were
at Cape Nome on October 18, while the
steamer Homer was off Cape Nome,
bound for St. Michael, on October 10.
There were at Dutch Harbor on October
23 the schooner Thomas F. Bayard and
; the steam whaler Kariuk. The latter was
to sail for San Francisco on October 24.
The catch of the whalers Is reported as
follows: Alexander 7. Balena V, Alaska
1, Belvedere 5. Howhead 6, Thrasher t>,
Kariuk 7. William BayliÃÃ 9, .Mermaid -'
and Fearless clean. The latter vessel has
â¢ not been spoken since last August, when
: Bhe was going to the eastward and was
to winter off Herschel Island.
The whaling bark Charles W. .Morgan
arrived from the Okhotsk Sea during the
afternoon. She brought into port
barrels of sperm oil, 200 barrels of whale
: oil and 2600 pounds of whalebone. On
mber 3 the Morgan spoke the whal
ing bark California, with %*) barrels of
sperm and 400 barrels of whale oil and
SUOO pounds of whalebone.
It was one of the Charles W. Morgan's
boat crews that picked up sixty pounds of
ambergris, valued at Jjm.Ow, in the Ok
' hotsk Sea.. The boat was chasing a whale
when the valuable fine! was made. Since
i then the ambergris has been sold .;.>d the
! money is in the pockets of the agent of
ih.' vessel. The story of the nnd w<l.~, iuid
in The Sunday Call a few weeks ago.
The Morgan lost one of her boats dur
-1 ing the cruise. Tin- Becond day out of the
1 Okhotsk Sea a whale was sighted and two
boats were lowered to give chase. First
Mate Morgan was in command of one and
: Fourth Mate Thurston of the other.
j Thurston harpooned the leviathan and a
I few minutes later Morgan put another
steel barb into it. The whale became in-
I furiated, and making for Morgan's boat
! smashed it like an egg shell. The men
i saw the monster coming and saved them
selves by jumping overboard.
In order to save his shipmates Thurston
I cut loose from the whale and it escaped i
I with two of the Morgan's harpoons sttck
! Ing in its body. The men were picked
1 up and put aboard the whaler and the
Morgan proceeded on her way to San
, Francisco.
The schooner Maggie C. Rups is coming
i here for repairs. While passing out of
! Tillamook Baj last week, bound for San
i Pedro, she struck on the bar and sprang
a leak. The captain at once put back to
port, and rinding his vessel more severely
damaged than he at first suspected wired
to San Francisco for instructions. He was
advised to k<> to Grays Harbor, where the
steamer National City will pick her up
and tow her to this port. On arriving here
the schooner will be discharged and put
on the drydoch for repairs.
The transport Leelanaw will sail to-day
for Manila with 27j horses, and the Cone- j
maugh to-morrow with 280 horses. Both j
ve:-<. -is will stop at Honolulu. The City ;
of Puebla went to the quarantine hulk at
Ansel Island yesterday to be fumigated, !
and the Senator took her place at Fol- i
fom street wharf. The Duke of Fife
docked at Harrison strr-et and will be got
ready for carrying troops as rapidly as
possible. The Ben Mohr will probably
sail on Saturday.
There was a very pleasant entortain
ment at the Seamen s Institute on Steuart j
street last Wednesday night. There was \
a big gathering of sailors from the coast
and geodetic steamer Pathfinder, training
phlp Pensacola and the various British
ships In port. Among: those who helped
entertain the audience were the families
of Captain John Leale of the Bay City
and Captain William Leale of the Caro
line. Captain William Leale grave a num
ber of very funny character sketches, and
Mrs. John Leale and the Misses Marion.
Edith and Elsie Leale. as the Hawaiian
quartet, made a most decided hit with the
sailor boys.

WELCOME TO THE
GALLANT KANSANS
Topeka Streets Crowded
With Visitors.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TOPEKA. Kan., Nov. 2.â Returning
warriors never received a more fitting
welcome home than that accorded to-day
to the soldiers of "Kansas' Famous Fight-
Ing Twentieth" on its arrival from San
Francisco. General Frederick Funston
came in for the lion's share of attention
shown the officers, and the "little hero of
Manila" was literally taken oft his feet
by his admirers In their eagerness to dis
play their regard for him.
At every station in Kansas, after the
Colorado line was crossed early this
morning, cheering crowds met the sol
diers and greeted them in unstinted fash
ion. Schools and colleges along the line
were closed, business was practically sus
pended and the people nocked to the
trains by the thousands.
Snow in the mountains had delayed the
trains and it was 12:55 this afternoon be
fore the first -section reached Topeka.
The three other sections followed closely,
the last squad of soldiers being landed
shortly before 4 o'clock.
So many thousands of people were on
the platform and the railroad tracks that
the train had to fairly crawl into the de
pot. Whistles screeched, cannon boomed,
dozens of bands played and the cheers
were almost deafening.
From every car window leaned soldiers,
waving hats and yelling and whooping
shrill hoorays. They leaped from the car
steps before the train stopped, and fell
into the arms of friends, who grasped and
hugged them and passed them on to eager
relatives and sweethearts.
Fathers and mothers pushed through
the crowd in a frantic endeavor to find
their boys." Many affecting scenes were
enacted.
General and Mrs. Funston were In the
rear Pullman of the first section. When
the train came to a stop there was a rush
to g't to them, and It took half a dozen
strong men to keep the people off the car
platform. A woman spied Mrs. Funston
at a win low and pushed her baby up to be
kissed by the generals wife. Mrs. Fun-
Bton complied promptly, arrd immediately
dozens of mothers reached forward with
their babies to be kissed.
Funston was hardly off the cars before
he was half-dragged, half-carried, up
stairs into the dining room.
Solid blocks of people tilled every street
leading to the depot, and the city was
taxed to its utmost to care for its guests.
It Beemed as if the whole State of Kansas
had come to town, and It Is estimated
that fully 60,000 outsiders were here. Tons
of bunting had been used in decorating
the buildings, and electrical and other
decorations were used with a lavish hand.
With the exasperating and unavoidable
break in the arrival of the trains bear
ing the .-oldier?, it was after 4 o'clock
when the parade began.
A guard of honor for the boys of the
Twentieth wns the Civil War veteran's,
the members of the National Guard and
many civic organizations. There were
thirty-two bands in the parade, the per
formers numbering nearly 1000 musicians.
The entire parade line, over two miles,
was a mass of cheering humanity.
General Funston with his wife rode in
the carriage of honor, while Colonel Met
caif. on a white charger, and Lieutenant
General Little, on a prancing black, took
their appointed stations at the head of
the regiment. All received ovations at
every point of the line.
At" the State House the military orders
were drawn up in line at the south steps.
chief Justice Doster in a brief Bpeech
introduced Genera] J. K. Hudson, who, on
behalf of the people of Kansas, presented
the beautiful $1000 sword to General
Puns ton.
In a short speech of acceptance General
Funston paid he predicted that in one
year's time the island of Luzon would
be as quiet as Massachusetts. "I return
to Manila," said he, "and unless I get
sick or Usabled, I will not return until
the war Is over. "
Colonel Metcalf followed General
Funston in a brief speech. Later in the
evening an elaborate banquet was served
in the new State library rooms to the
soldiers and officers of the Twentieth.
! The day Â« losed with the most magnificent
! display" of fireworks In the evening ever
| given in the State's history.

MUST ALL PROVE
THEIR RIGHT TO
RETAIN COMMAND
Six Volunteer Officers
in Trouble.
ORDERED FOR EXAMINATION
THREE RESIGNED WHEN THE
OBDEB WAS ISSUED.
Weeding Out Men Who Have liearned
Nothing From One "War and
Wish to Fight in An
other.
Those officers of the Forty-sixth Regi
ment who have not taken the pains to
qualify themselves for the positions they
hold are having a hard time. Six of them
have been ordered before a board of reg
ular cfflcers to be examined as to their
ntness to perform the duties of their
rank. Three of the officers resigned as
soon as the orders for the board were
issued, but the other three are going to
take the risk.
The six officers of the Forty-sixth or
dered up for examination are: Captain
William B. Thomas, Captain Lewis Pate
bone, First Lieutenant Wallace W. Batch
elder, First Lieutenant Benjamin P. Luk
ens, Second Lieutenant George W. Earl
and Second Lieutenant Carlos W. Pierce.
Batchelder, Lukens and Pierce resigned,
and Thomas was up before the board yes
terday His examination was not con
cluded! but it will be this morning, and
then the board will take up the others.
The board is composed of Lolonei Â±i % ts.
Freeman, Twenty-fourth Infantry; Co -
onel Jacob B. Rawles, Third Artillery;
Captain Sedgwick Pratt, Third Artillerj,
ana Second Lieutenant William i orse,
Third Artillery, recorder.
In each case there is some specific
charge of incompetence or neglect of duty
preferred by the colonel of the regiment,
and this particular charge, as well as
their general ntness, will be gone into by
the board. Â
In the formation of all the second call
regiments the colonels were notified that
the officers would be assigned to the regi
ments without examination, the only
qualification being that they had served
in the war with Spain. If, however, at
the end of a certain time any officer
showed that he was incapable of perform
ing the duties he had undertaken the
colonel was directed to apply for a board
..I examination and have the officer or
dered to appear before it. This is what
the colonel of the Forty-sixth is doing.
The report of the board will be sub
mitted to department headquarters and
from there it will be sent to Washington.
The â officers examined will probably re
sign if they believe the report of the
board will go against thorn; but at any
rate, if it he not favorable, General Shaf
ter will not allow them to proceed to
Manila before army headquarters has
been heard from.
It is the intention of the department to
establish a permanent, hospital at the
Presidio in place of the general hospital
now there. This does not necessarily
mean that the buildings will be changed,
but they will be fitted up with all the
modern appliances to make them more
comfortable. It was not intended in the
ftrsi place to establish a permanent gen
eral hospital at the Presidio, but that is
now the intention.
Private George Burr. Company C of the
Forty-nfth Infantry, was seriously
wounded Wednesday night by the acci
dental discharge of his rifle. It was loaded
and It- was cleaning it. and the cartridge
was exploded, the bullet passing through
his left arm at the elbow. The arm was
amputated at the general hospital yes
terday.
HIS BRILLIANT RECORD.
Alfred P. Black Has Proved Himself
to Be the Right Man for Dis
trict Attorney.
Alfred P. Black is remarkably well
equipped to serve the people of San Fran
cisco as District Attorney. He has had
â  wide experience, having been identified
' with the District Attorney's office for a
I long time, and at present he holds the
position of Chief Deputy District Attor
ney. Mr. Black has conducted at least
1000 criminal trials in the city of San
â¢ Francisco and has been remarkably sue
; cessful. During the present year he has
I rendered characteristic service's. Out of
eighty-six important cases committed to
! his charge he has secured sixty-six con
victions, which Is a noteworthy record.
Mr. Black is possessed >>f a rare judicial
â  quality which is so important in the men
tal make-up of a public prosecutor.
While he does not wish to see a guilty
man escape, yet if there is the slightest
doubt in his mind with regard to the cul
pability of the prisoner he is inclined to
lean to mercy's side and will not insist
on the extreme penalty, except in cases
which seem to demand it. If he thinks
the defendant Innocent he win say so and
end the prosecution. Alfred P. Black de
serves and will receive the support of the
good people of San Francisco for the of-
Bee of District Attorney. His splendid
record in the past is a guaranty for the
future.

also been granted to Sylvia Neuman from
Walter S. Neuman on the ground of de
sertion and Franz A. Uenkel from Hen

Judge Cook Discharges Him From
Custody and Dismisses the
Jury.
Dr. Christian C. J. Wachendorf, who
has been on trial for the murder of John
Kchlenbeck, was ordered discharged from
custody and the jury dismissed by Judge
Cook yesterday. Some of the stars of the
detective department reached the conclu
sion that Kehlenbeck came to his death
through the administration of morphine
by his roommate. Dr. Wachendorf. They
based their conclusion on the facts that
Kehlenbeck was dead, and that as he had
a few hundred dollars it was sufficient
motive for Wachendorf to murder him In
hopes of getting the gold.
Expert witnesses, however, were una
ble to ascertain the cause of Kehlen
beck's death. District Attorney Solomons
passed several days in an endeavor to
prove that Kehlenbeck had died other
than a natural death, but *falled. Judge
Cook then toÂ«k tbe matter in his own

DEMOCRATS ON PHELAN.
THERE is something direct and potent in the
expression of their opinions by the straight
Democrats who support Dr. Cleveland for
Mayor and reject Phelatt. At their meeting in Met
ropolitan Hal! a spade was not called a teaspoon
nor a pickax a toothpick. Their principal speaker.
Mr Harris concluded his arraignment of Pheian by
asking his hearers to "save this city from bossism
infinitely more absolute, vicious and intolerant than
, any which has ever reared its hydra head in San
Francisco. Do this by voting against the
Phelanistic-Examineristn, which is an unequivocal
ety, dangerous to public florals, an in
to the public conscience, to clean journalism,
clean government and genuine progress, and is op
posed to commercial and industrial enterprise, to
true Democracy and in general to that fair fame of
San Francisco, which all good citizens desire to up- j
hold." .
In quoting this we cannot say the ' italics are
--." for in accent and emphasis it is all the work
recent political associate and supporter of Mr.
Pheian. If it cast a light on the situation which
makes men blink, it is not from Republican but
Democratic sources.
These gentlemen have grown familiar with the
Mayor's methods by intimate association with him
in the same party, and they are supposed to testify
from abtindance of knowledge. They have the nat
ural feeling of party men who desire that party vic
tories shall be properly credited, and the proposition
to have a personal victory for Mr. Pheian, ignoring
the party, is repugnant to them.
From their frequent and frank expressions it is evi
dent that they not only resent his assumption of
being better than his party, if not. too good for it
altogether, but they regard him as not as good as
the party, and put forward his methods as evidence
â¢' it
Nothing done by a common, unshaven boss was
ever grosser than Phelan's forcing of Geary's nomi
nation and his remark that "Geary may be a scrub.
,bi:t we must have a soldier on the ticket."
In ridiculous background to this is Geary's declara
tion that Pheian is "our war Mayor" and his intima
tion that the war Mayor's influence reached the Phil
ippines, and was more potent than the Federal Gov
ernment in nerving our soldiers to pursue the Fili
pino skedaddlers. No wonder there is some nau*ea
in the pit of the old Democratic stomach at the
spectacle of a war Mayor and a scrub standing as
candidates of the old party while denying its existence
and ignoring its principles. Dr. Cleveland, Mr. Tlar
-lis and their colleagues are certainly entitled to pub
lic respect for their attitude on straight politics.
The Pheian leadership by Gavin McNab suggests
other funny combinations and strange bedfellowships.
When McNab controlled the committee for the cele
bration of the Fourth of July he was so rancorous
against union labor organizations that he prevented
the employment of union bands to play for the pro
>ii. The result was that no labor organizations
appeared in the parade, and Barry's Star opened
every vial of its celebrated wrath on him and changed
his name in its columns to "Gavin McScab." Now
McNab is pulling the stroke oar for Pheian. and
the Star i* in noisy accord with the combination.
Such a mixture of fish, flesh and fowl makes the
gorge rise in the throat of old-fashioned Democ
racy, and its representatives are warranted in oppos
ing such a political burgoo.
One of the surprises of the Ohio campai^^ has
been the success achieved by Senator Ilanna as n
stump orator. It was known that he is a good or
ganizer, but doubts were felt concerning his ability
to make a speech and mix with the people. These
have now been dissipated and it appears there arc
no mass-meetings of the canvass more largely at
tended than those at which he is announced as to
speak.
The announcement of further difficulties in the way
of the settlement of the Samoan question is a matter
of no surprise. When three great nations like the
United States, Great Britain and Germany try to get
on to so small a group of islands with both feet there
is bound to be trouble.
A NOTABLE PETITION.
NF.YF.R before did there go from the people of
rnia so strong a petition for the appoint
ment of a particular individual to a political
office as that which will request President McKinley
to appoint William R. Wheeler to the vacancy in the
Interstate Commerce Commission. That much can
he safely said, for among the organizations signing
the petition through their officials are some which,
like the Merchants' Association of this city and the
Chamber of Commerce of Los Angeles, have never
before urged upon an appointing power the selection
of a particular candidate for any office.
The extent to which all the commercial and in
dustrial organizations of the entire Pacific Coast have
united in supporting the candidacy of Mr. Wheeler
is not only complimentary to him but is significant
of the prevailing feeling of the people of the coast
States upon the issue at stake. Our merchants and
manufacturers have now to meet the aggressive
claims and demands of Chicago and St. Louis and at
the same time guard against the schemes of the
Southern Pacific Company. Just why the Southern
Pacific should be at this time antagonizing
the coast is not clear, hut the antagonism is mani
fest, and in defending our interests before the Inter
state Commerce Commission as -.veil as in seeking
to obtain the appointment of a Pacific Coast repre
sentative on the commission, the merchants and
manufacturers have to beware of railroad hostility at
home as well as the open contest made by the big
cities of the Mississippi Valley.
The petition to the President sets forth that the
delay in it-; presentation has been due solely to the
determination of the signers not to indorse any one
for the place until such time as they could indicate
to the President "the unanimous choice of the busi
ness interests of the whole coast." They are now
able to do that. As the petition says: "A conven
tion has just been held in this city of the Pacific
Const Jobbers' and Manufacturers' Association,
which was attended by representatives from every
line of business from the States of Washington, Ore
gon and California. At that convention the matter
of indorsing some one for the vacancy caused by the
resignation of Mr. Calhoun was taken up, and Mr.
W. R. Whfe'er of this city was the choice, without
c-nc dissenting vote."
The organizations which unite in the petition in
clude almost every important commercial or indus
trial association on the coast. Mr. Wheeler therefore
st.'.nds as the representative of the business interests
of this section of the Union, and those who oppose
his candidacy are virtually opposing the selection of
any man from the coast at all. Fortunately no op
position has thus far manifested itself except that of
the Southern Pacific and the organs of that com
pany. Even that opposition ought now to cease. It
TIIE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, NOVKMItEK 8, 1899,
has been declared over and over again that in the
movement for protecting the trade interests of the
coast there is designed no injury to the railroad. It
will, in fact, serve the welfare of the roads to build
up the trade of California, Oregon and Washington.
Mr. Wheeler represents a force which is working
for the benefit of all, and his indorsement by the
people of the coast should be made unanimous.
Congressman Roberts, the polygarnist, against
whom the shafts of scores of societies are aimed, has
at last found a champion. She is a woman, lives in
Chicago, and insists, with a woman's logic, that
Roberts ought to be seated as a member of the House
of Representatives. Her rftasoa is the customary
ladylike one of "simply because."
IU R. E. L. COLNOX of the Stockton Mail
/ \ goes to the trouble and expense of lampoon
ing the proprietor and manager of The Call.
He indulges in most extraordinary statements of his
code of ethics and exudes malice from his intellectual
pores until the result makes him appear like a hip
popotamus indulging iji a red sweat. In defense of
his code of morals Mr. Colnon says: "What would
be grossly immoral in one country might be quite the
proper thing in another." And to this he adds: "A
newspaper is not an agency for the elevation of the
morals of a people and cannot be made such."
We are sure that all readers of the Stockton Mail
acquit it of any attempt to elevate morals, or even
to let them stay as good as it found them.
Because The Call has said that certain leprous
practices can be limited by letting the light of pub
licity fall upon them Mr. Colnon is sure that we in
tend to blackmail somebody. We don't know what
he has been doing lately that he ducks his head when
ever expo-nre is mentioned.
His reference to the proprietor of The Call in con
nection with the subject of blackmail sug-gests the
attempt he made to stand up the Valley Railroad for
a large sum of money and its exposure to the direct
erf, by the proprietor of The Call. Mr. Colnon has
certainly lived down to his code of ethics, not only
in journalism but in office. While people were com
pelled to do public business with him as secretary to
the Governor of California they were not long in
finding out that he held peculiar views as to the op
portunities of his position. When application was
sent through him for removal of penal disabilities,
with full explanation of the case, he did not con
sider the reasons sufficient for consideration and re
quested the parties concerned to "dig up" sufficient
testimony in the case to justify his attention to it.
How many may have "'dug up" and who, during his
term as Secretary, are things unknown to the pub
lic. But as he considers what is immoral in one
country may be highly moral in another, the transfer
of that idea to official life is easy and he would find
no difficulty in making it. As he stood at one end
of the process of "digging up" and the digger stood
at the other, what to the digger seemed highly im
moral, to Mr. Colnon may have seemed moral and
proper, as he insists that right and wrong are not
actual, but are interchangeable according to the
point of view.
When the "digging up" probably Rot bad, Colnon
\va=i transferred to the Harbor Commission and be
came its president. His record there i< written in
the judicial findings in the case of Irwin vs. the
commission. From the testimony in that case it is
evident that the water front was in luck that it did
not get carried off. It was said that even the clock
in the ferry tower, having its good manners cor
rupted by evil associations, was frequently seen to
hold one hand behind its back, and the time ball
bn athed freer every day when it slid up the pole pre
paratory to it? meridian fall, for things that could
rcost high were safer.
We have no doubt that Mr. Colnon's secret soul
utters itself out of hi; personal experience when he
- in his lampoon: "Publicity of crime increases
crime. The Call's fool notion that the fear of pub
licity will deter those wrongly inclined is all that
could be expected from a man with half a head."
We admit that from the standpoint of our ex
perience with Colnon he i-- right. We have no rea
son to believe that any fear of publicity, or even the
glare of a judicial exposure, ever made him bat an
eye or drove him off the trail of a job that he had in
sight or scent.
Our only justification is that we believed him to be
the exception that proves the rule. We do not pre
tend that any publicity would affect him. but we
hope there are others, whose good name has not yet
become a reminiscence, who would turn away from
the lure of passion or greed and put temptation be
hind them for sheer pride in a good reputation which
exposure and publicity would destroy.
In this world, where traps arc set on every hand
and where the steadfastness of men is often shaken
by the example of flourishing iniquity to which Mr.
Colnon has been a contributor, society requires that
no influence should be omitted that will keep men
in the straight path. If the fear of publicity is one
such influence, the newspaper which holds it over the
man that is poising between right and wrong, uncer
tain whether to take the plunge or stand upright, is
a proper agency in the elevation of morals which
prevents transgression by the certainty of exposure.
While publicity did not succeed in reforming Col
non, the fear of it may so deter others as to leave
him the distinction of standing alone, a monument
of incorrigibility, standing on his reputation like a
crow on a carcass, cawing his belief that all meat is
carrion.
A late dispatch from Ladysmith announcing that
a number of stragglers from the regiments captured
by the Boers have made their escape and returned
to that city, adds: "A number of mules with a por
tion of the mountain battery have also come in." It
is therefore evident the mule has not been so pesky
as was reported. By bringing back some of the gins
he has done something at [east to atone for stam
peding and upsetting the ammunition wagon.
When the United States acquired the Sulu Islands
there was a distinct understanding that the re
ligious beliefs of the natives were to be respected.
Among the beliefs thus honored is one which makes
the killing of Christians a passport to paradise. This
very interesting fact may suggest, perhaps, that the
Sulu Islands are first-class places for enthusiastic
missionaries to shun.
The Republican party lms put a clean ticket in the
municipal contest, and if the voters give it a clean
victory they will receive in return a clean adminis
tration in every branch of the city government.

THE COLOSSAL STATUE
DESIGNED BY A QUEEN
R<~>ME, Sept. 10.â The colossal statue of the Virgin, designed by Queen Mar
gherita herself, has been unveiled and dedicated. This enormous bronze
rests on a massive pedestal on inaccessible Rocca Melone, one of the hlgh
fst peaks in the Italian Alps. The statue was paid for by the contributions of
150.000 school children, their tribute to the Virgin Mother in grateful commemora
tion of the rescue of the members of a company of Alpine militia from an aval
ancheâa rescue so remarkable that the soldiers ascribed it to the direct influence
of the Virgin, to whom they prayed in their strep?.
Graven in the pedestal is an invocation from the Pope praying the Virgin to
guard the frontier of Italy.
BLACK AND WHITE

: There is an old theory, upheld by Mr.

fnr behind a burnt cork performer, but
the theory isn't worth a dumb canary
while Miss Dresser's pickaninnies can Itb
s.-...n upon the same as Jack N"r
worth. The first glimpse of the little
brown boys conjures up visions of melon
patches and chicken roosts such as burnt
cork never suppist?. And there is a
whip-noor-will tone in the genuine ncj*rn
voice, a jgueer little wall that is the ripht
ful heritage of these same youngsters and
that can no more belong to the fairer race

Ada Palmer-Walker la "The Bohemian

It is a case of cold-blooded murder. She

Caroline Knowles, the new comer, >s a

The bitterest disappointment Is Alf

NEW COURT RULE.
! Supreme Court Changes the Order for j
Holding Examinations.
At every quarterly examination by the
Supreme Court of applicants for admis
sion to practice the number of would-be -
lawyers is astonishing , and the number !
seems to be increasing. The Justices have !
j decided to change the mode of holding ex- ,
' aminations, for yesterday they issued the
following new order:
Order Amending Order Relating to Examina
tions of Applicants for Admission to Practice |
| Law â Applicants for admission to practice law
| will not hereafter be examined in open court
I at the sessions held in Sacramento and Pan !
i Francisco. In pursuance of the amendment :
; to section 27C of the Code of Civil Procedure |
the Commissioners of the Supreme Court or!
any three of them are hereby designated to |
j conduct public examinations of all persons who
present applications filed in due form. Such
; examinations will be held at the Supreme Court
rooms In Ban Francisco on the second Monday :
' in March, June. September and December of
. each year. No person rejected shall be at
I liberty to renew the application earlier than \
' the second regular examination next after such :
â  rejection. ! Until otherwise ordered applicants
; who are bona fide residents of any of the
' counties of the I,os Angeles district will, if i
; they so desire, be examined at the beginning
i of each session of the court In Los Angeles
!as heretofore. The next examination will be :
j held December 11, 1599.
ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
JACK DEMPSEY'S DEATH-Reader,
City. Jack Dempsey. the pugilist, died on
the Ist of November. 1595.
GOLDENSONS CRIMEâ J. H. M.. City.
Mamie Kelly was shot and killed in San
Francisco by Alexander Goldenson on the
10th of November, 1886.
THE PALACE HOTELâ W. W. N.,
City. The cost of erecting the Palace Ho
tel, in San Francisco, was between three
and one-half and four millions of dollars.
MANILA CIGARSâ B., City. Ninety
twn brands of cigars are manufactured in
the city >f Manila, P. 1., and thirty of
these have bands, or rings, around them.
JOHN DAVIS AND WIFE-W. T. H.,
Stockton. Cal. John Davis and wife, who
attempted to run across the continent in
an automobile, returned to the point
whence they started.
AGAIN THE CENTURYâ An Old Sub
scriber, City. The next century will com
mence on the Ist of January. 1901. Why,
is fully explained in an answer to another
correspondent in this department Octo
ber 22, 1899.
LOS ANGELES' DIRECTORYâ A. O. S.,
City. A copy of the Los Angeles Direc
tory may be seen in the office of th^ City
Directory in this city, in the lfuilding on
Rush street, near Sansome, occupied by
Crocker & Co.
A SMALL BOOKâ L. C City. A book
"one inch long, three-quarters of an inch
wide, containing illustrated fables and
song? in French, printed in Paris, France,
in 1R24." is probably one of the smallest
books ever printed." Such a book has no
market value, but is worth just whatever
it will bring from one who may wish to
buy it as a curiosity.
WHlTEWASHâ Subscriber, City. The
following' receipt for whitewash is the one
sent out by the Lighthouse Board of the
United States Treasury Department. It
has been found by experience, to answer
on wood, brick and stone nearly aa well
as oil paint and is much cheaper: "Slack
one-half bushel of unslacked lime witn
hoilintr water, keeping it covered during
the process. Strain it and add a peck Oi
salt, dissolved In warm water; three
pounds of ground rice put in boiling wa
ter and boiled to a thin paste; half a
pound of powdered Spanish wniting and a
pound of clear glue, dissolved in warm
water; mix these well together, and let
the mixture stand for several days. Keep
the wash thus prepared in a kettle or
portable furnace, and when used put it on
as hot as possible with a painter s or a
whitewash brush."
SOUTH SEA ISLANDSâ M.. Placerville,
Cal. Any first-class bookseller can fur
nish literature on the South Sea Islands
and books on boatbuilding. The question
"Are the South Sea Islands a good place
for a young man to go for business? is
too broad to admit of a general answer.
You should select the island you would
like to go to, and if there is a I nited
States Consul thf-re. write to him, tell ng
him what line of business you would like
to engage in, and he will advise you.
MAN-OF-WARâ S., City. Man-of-war
is a phrase applied to a line-of-battle ship,
contrary to the usual rule of the English
language by which all ships are feminine.
Talbot in "Words and Their Origin"
"The use of this term probably ar
the following manner: Men-of-war were
heavily armed soldiers. A ship full of
them would be called ;i man-of-war ship.
In process of time the word ship was dis
carded as unnecessary, and there re
mained the phrase man-of-war." After
the "ship"' was dropped from the phrase
man-of-war became the appellation of the
vessel instead of the man. as originally,
and now the individual is known as a
man-of-war's man. The plural of man-nf
war. either individual or vessel, is men-of
war.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 1899.
HORACE DAVIS' GALLANT LEADERSHIP
OF THE MUNICIPAL REFORM FORCES
Phelan Appeals to Boss Rainey for Help From the
Fire Departmentâ Demoralized Democratic
Nominees Ready to Knife One Another.
i INCREASING strength of the Davis
I column alarms the bosses.
Yesterday Boss Ralney passed the
I word along the line directing the Fire
â *â  Department to set out and save Phe
lan from defeat.
There Is no longer the shadow of doubt
that Mayor Phelan has committed, him
self to Ralney's management of the de-
I partment. The firemen have received In
! struction from their master to line up for
: Phelan and the nominees for the Board
I of Supervisors on the Democratic ticket.
As a Bure sign of the demoralization !n
; the Democratic camp, the- fact can be
; stated that messages on the quiet were
j conveyed yesterday to several nominees
i on the Republican ticket Indicating that
! the Fire Department boys would not
I stand out for the entire Democratic
ticket. As the election of John I^ackmann
j for Sheriff and Asa R. Wells for Auditor
; Is already conceded, by politicians of both
â  political parties. Boss Rainey Is anxious
1 to be in a position to aek for Republican
I favors.
The knifing of the Democratic ticket by
Ralney is already proposed. A straight
out Democrat with ordinary perceptive
i faculties ought to understand the drift of
â  things. Phelan is up against the hardest
I fight that ever confronted him. and he
j will leave no resource untouched to win
j out. If it becomes necessary to knife men
i on the Democratic ticket to secure a Phe-
I lan triumph, the knifing will be done by
Ralney and his gang without any qualms
of conscience. -When a Democrat as high-
I ly esteemed as Judge Magulre was knifed
to his political death in the house of his
pretended friends, does any one suppose
J that the political heelers and their leaders
' would hesitate to knife the Democratic
i nominees for Sheriff and Auditor. Re
publicans should beware of all trading
i overtures. A sweeping victory may be
won by Republicans if they will resolutely
j resolve to stand by the ticket from top to
, bottom.
It is perhaps unfortunate for the honest
j Democrats of San Francisco that they
! have no great morning newspaper to spe-
c ially advocate their cause and tell them
the truthâ the inside regarding the
' attitude of Phelan, Rainey and McNab.
If such a newspaper were published it
would tell the Democratic voters that a
campaign on behalf of the Democratic
1 ticket is not being conducted at the head
quarters of the Democratic County Com
'< mittee in the Columbian building. A few
j old-timers go there, sit around or move
; about leisurely from one chair to an
! other. There is no bustle or activity at
i the place. Throngs of workers, animated
' by party zeal, do not come and go. Ap
i parently no effort is being mud.- to elect
the ticket. It must not be supposed that
Phelan is idle. He Is conducting a bureau
of his own creation, and In connection
j with the Phelan bureau, the Fire Depart
! ment, mastered by Boss Rainey, is work
ing. The scheme Is to elect Phelan, Dodge
! and Lane. Agents employed by Phelan
are making house to house visits to as
certain the names of electors in each dis
trict that intend to vote for or against
Phelan. _â¢ . ..]
The Call, a Republican newspaper, num
bers among its subscribers thousands of
good Democrats, and therefore it becomes
a duty to point out to Democratic readers
that the Committee of One Hundred, with
headquarters in the Columbian building,
is not making any fight to speak of for
the Democratic municipal ticket. Rainey
at the St. George stables is giving out in
j structions to the Fire Department to
work for Phelan. Gavin McNab, in the
Mills building, is working for Phelan and
I Dodge, and bo it goes along the line. Poli
i tical principle Is thrown to the winds.
I The campaign has degenerated so far as
I the Democratic leaders are concerned to
; a mild and demoralized chase for public
office.
Every hour adds to the strength and
confidence of th. Horace Davis legions.
Retail merchants of Republican faith
who voted for Phelan in 1806 and again
in ISPS were somewhat Indifferent at the
beginning of the campaign, but It is grat
ifying to observe that the merchants are
awakening to a sense of their obligations
to the Republican party for the unexam
pled prosperity which the city enjoys.
The example of wholesale merchants In
the Indorsement of Horace Davis for
Mayor is being emulated by the retail
dealers.
The worklngmen of the city are all right
for Horace Davis. His leadership is wel-
I corned by the masses. South of Market
street he' will get a tremendous vote, In
i the Republican districts north of Market
street he will receive old-time Republican
â  majorities.
Mayor Phelan Is not so haughty and
domineering as lv was early in the cam
paign, when he denounced as traitors all
Republicans who discussed national is
sues. In his talk to, the Monticello Club
at Metropolitan Temple Friday evening,
I October 27, he gave notice in effect that
he considered as traitors all Republicans
! who could not vote the Phelan ticket, and
then proclaimed that such treasonable
Republicans should not be appointed to
| any governing commission under the new
charter if he were re-elected Mayor. In
that speech Phelan proclaimed himself too
small for the high office of Mayor under
the new charter.
The rallies last night In support of the
i Republican cause were enthusiastic. Pop

DETHRONED BOSSES
INDORSE PHELAN
W11..L, the property-owners of
Ban Francisoc bear in mind
that the bosses of both politi
cal parties are shouting for Mayor
Phelan? Among the bosses re
cently dethroned was A. J. Ralsch,
chairman of the old Crimmins and
Kelly Republican County Com
mittee. He Is connected In busi
ness with Street Contractor J. \V.
McDonald. These contractors ex
pect that the public treasury will
be opened to pay for extravagant
plans of street extension if Phelan
shall be allowed to appoint the
Board of Public Works. Therefore
the Raisch & McDonald wagons
are placarded with Phelan signs,
and the contractors themselves
are throwing up their hats for
Phelan.
The Call desires to bring the
subject directly home to the tax
payers that the Fire Department
bosses, the rapacious street con

BUSINESS MEN TURN
OUT TO HEAR DAVIS
issues of \\i% Campaign Made
Cleir at Pioneer Hail.
The issues of the present campaign were
never more clearly presented than at the
meeting held last night at ~ ioneer Hall,
nndt-r the auspices of the Horace Davis
Business Men's Club. S. H. Kent presided
and the hail and gallery were filled and
standing n >m was a 1 a premium long be
fore the lirsr speaker was announced.
\Viil San Francisco, which has profited
SO largely from the policy of the Repub
lican administration, slap that administra
tion in the face and say that It disap
proves that policy by electing the Phelan
ticket? That was the question put by
every speaker to every man in the audi
ence. That was the question each speak
er answered with a rousing "no," and the
applause that greeted the answer was
proof that it was the heartfelt sentiment
of the meeting.
"No!" thundered the speaker. "San
Francisco will not be so foolish as to do
anything of the kind. She will elect the
ticket beaded by Horace Davis and flash
the answer back to McKlnley that the
people of Ban Francisco, Idle when he
went Into office, approve of his policy that
has set them at work in the van of pros
perity."
Chairman Kent was in the midst of his
opening address, when Horace Davis en
tered the hall and ;h>- meeting broke otit
Into applause, to which tin- candidate for
Mayor bowed right and left as he walked
to the platform, where he was given three
cheers more. He was introduced almost
Immediately afterward, and began an ad
dress which showed that the campaign
was not wearing on his powers. He began,
addressing his hearers as business men,
by talking business. What the city need
ed, he said, was a business administra
tion.
"If I am elected Mayor," he said. "I
would first attend to what I deem to be
the essential requirements of the city, and
my first desire would be that the city
should have good Bewers, good hospitals
aiid good schools. The city government
is a great corporation and requires to l><
managed with the same prudence and
economy we practice In our own affairs.
1 do not believe it is good policy to run
the corporation Into debt. I do not believe
It Is good economy to spend money unless
you know what you are spending it forâ
unless you can pet quid pro quo."
After eulogizing his colleagues on the
ticket Mr. Davis had something to say of
the administration's anxiety concerning
the San Francisco election.
"Now. my friends." he said, "the pros
perity of Ran Francisco is the result of
the wise policy of the Republican admin
istration. 4t is the wise protective policy
In the case of the manufacturer and the
expansive policy in the ease of the com
mercial interestsâ and I want to say to
you that the administration is asking you
to hold up its hands. It is looking with
anxiety to the result of elections in dif
ferent States and this flection far away,
the only sign to be seen on this coast
as to whether the people are in sympathy
with the policy of the administration. It
is looking: with anxiety to see whether
you are holding up its hands or whether
you are turning your backs upon this
prosperity and turn down the adminis
tration.
"Now, my friends, It Is not a matter of
indifference if it is telegraphed across the
continent on November 8 that San Fran
cisco has gone Democraticâ that the city
that stood nearest to our new possessions
and profited most from its policy had
turned down the administration. I can
never believe that this city will be guilty
of such ingratitude and such lack of com
mercial intelligence as to put the Demo
crats in power on the 7th of November."
After three rousing cheers for Mr. Davis
D. E. MeKinlay was introduced to the
audience. He devoted himself, when not
interrupted by applause, to pointing out
the uses to which Mr. Phelan and Mr.
Davis had put their wealth. In the rec
ord of the present Mayor he found that
no industry had been started to help
labor. In that of Mr. Davis he found all
the capital Invested in enterprises em
ploying labor.
Attorney General Tlrey I^. Ford made a
telling argument in favor of the return of
the Republican candidates.
"The verdict of San Francisco on Tues
day next," he said, "will be heralded
throughout tills country either as an In
dication that San Francisco favors the
expansion of her commerce or that she
would join with Mr. Atkinson and Mr.
Bryan and others who would withdraw
from the Philippines and. cowardly, trail
back to our own home again. I do not
believe that the business men of San
Francisco are going to permit it. I do
not believe that the wage-earners are go
ing to permit it. I do not believe they
are going to turn hack the hands of pro"
grosy on the dial of events."
â¢>â  L. Nagle, candidate for Police Judge,
and G. Golden also made addresses.
MISSION DISTRICT
SOLID FOR DAVIS
Thirty=Fiftli District Republi
cans Hold a Housing Rally.
The Republicans of the Thirty-fifth As
sembly District gave evidence last night
that the Mission Is going to roll up a
rousing big vote f<ir Horace Davis. The
rally held at Twenty-lifth and Valencia
streets was one of the largest, most
earnest and most enthusiastic political
gatherings ever hold in that section of the
City. I-tmg before the .speakers appeared
it was evident that the hall would not be
large enough to accommodate the citizens
who were anxious and proud to show
their fealty to the Republican cadidates
and Republican principles. A large
crowd, unable to find room inside, or
ganized an overflow meeting on the side
walk. When those inside applauded the
outsiders took the rue and made the Mis
sion ring with their cheers and shouts for
DaViS and good municipal government.
Tiie reception given Mr. Davis took on
the air ot an ovation.
W. Warren, president of the Thirty
fifth Assembly District Republican Club,
under whose auspices the rally was given,
presided. Without any preliminaries he
Introduced as the first speaker of the even
ing Lucius Solomons, who placed Horace
Davis in nomination before the Republi
can Municipal Convention. He Impressed
upon the audience the fact that the ap-
H< aching election Would be the most im
portant e\er held in the city, and dem
onstrated by an able argument that the
election Of Horace Davis was necessary
to show that the people of the West ap
prove the administration of President Mc-
Kinlfey and the principles of the Republi
can party. Mr. Solomons asserted that the
reason Mr. Phelan fought shy of national
politics was because lie had none. No
one, according to the speaker, had been
able to tell whether he was a gold or a
free-silver Democrat, ;; tree trader or a
protect irfnist, an expansionist or an antl
exjiansionist.
John Murphy, who was in the employ of
Horace Davis for eight years, said that
he felt it was a duty of gratitude he
owed the Republican candidate to rec
ommend him to his fellow workingmen.
"I am working for t'ncle Sam now,"
said Mr. Murphy. "You know he is a
pretty good boss, but from my experience
I know he is not a bit better than Horace
Davis. " He said that the Republican can
didate has always stood up to elevate
labor.
Colonel T. V. Eddy followed and made
an address that aroused all the enthu
siasm and fire in the audience. By way
i of Introductory he said that he never felt
' smaller in hts life. He had, by mistake,
found his way into a nearly Democratic
meeting and was preparing to make an
address when he discovered His error. He
said the issue of the campaign was not
home rule, as claimed by the Phelanites,
but as to who should rule.
HORACE DAVIS THE
CHAMPION OF LABOR
If the workingmen of San Francisco
have not forgotten the great work done
in behalf of organized white labor by
Horace Davis in years gone by his elec
tion as Mayor of this city is certain, for
they will vote for him almost to a man.
It is nearly twenty years since Horace
Davis served in Congress, and the record
he made while representing the people of
this section of the State in the national
capital lor four years made him the idol
of the white laborers of the coast.
That was when California was con
fronted with the problem at protecting
the labor of its wnite citizens from the
disastrous competition of swarms of Chl
i;. .-â¢â  coolies who were pouring into this
country from the Orient. In the great
battle for the restriction of Chinese labor
Horace Davis loomed up as the champion
of the laboring man, and it was through
his diligent and aggressive work that the
passage of the Chinese exclusion act was
linally secured.
Horace Davis was at that time fully
appreciated by the workingmen, and no
man in all California was more popular
cr better loved by the men who earned
their bread by the sweat of their brows,
Practically every labor organization in
til'- city adopted resolutions indorsing
him and praising him for the good work
he had dune and which he continued to
do as long as he remained in Congress.
The workingmen of San Francisco or
ganised torchlight parades and marched
"through the streets of the city shouting
the praises of Horace Davis With wild,
enthusiasm. In countless other .ways they
gave expression to their gratitude and
appreciation. Horace Davis was their
idol. .
Even before he was sent to Congress
Horace Davis was universally recognized
as. the true friend of the workingman; a
man whom they could trust and whose
word was as good as his bond; a man in
the wisdom of whose friendly counsel
they placed absolute faith, a faith that
was never shaken.
It is possible that time may have dulled
the memory of some . of those who knew
Horace Davis in those- days, but when
these incidents are recalled, to them they
will not fail to recollect that he was their
benefactor and their friend at all times
and under all circumstances.
The Horace Davis of to-day is the same
Horace Davis of twenty years ago. The
Intervening years have but added to his

111. JOHN RANDOLPH.
(John Randolph of Roanoke was for
many years the most striking figure in
American political life. So great were
his vagaries that many believed he was
not wholly sane. He was born In 1773 and
died in 1533. In early life he gave signs
of his unbalanced nature, for before he
was five years old he would give way to
ungovernable fits of anger, swooning
from the violence of his passion. As a
boy, in a Southern slave-holding; com
munity, he grew up with little restraint
upon his naturally Imperious will. In
public life he placed little if any check
upon his temper, which manifested Itself
in Invectives of wonderful violence and
insolence, showing an utter disregard of
the feelings of those who were the vic
tims of his tongue lashings. Probably no
man in American public life has ever sur
passed him In rancorous abuse of politi
cal opponents. When a member of the
House of Representatives he would enter
the hall, tall and gaunt of figure, booted
and spurred, whi ;.'â â â â â â â â â â â â â â

The period was al

course. This oppor-B
tunity they had â â â â â â â â â 
foolishly thrown away by passing the
alien and sedition laws, which at once
brought into play the determined ' hos
tility of the Republicans. The latter had
from the first dreaded the establishment
of a national government strong enough
to control and perhaps subvert the State
governments, and they believed that
these laws were a long stride In that di
rection. To meet this bold move of the
Federalists, and at the same time bring
Into prominence the State as an essential
factor in our scheme of government, the
Republican Legislatures of Virginia and
Kentucky, under the lead of Madison and
Jefferson, issued the Virginia and Ken
tucky resolutions. These resolutions de
liberately ignored the Supreme Court,
and proposed that the constitutionality
of an obnoxious law should be submitted
for decision to the several States of the
Union. This evidently transferred the
final exercise of sovereignty from the na
tion to the States. Had it prevailed the
national edifice reared by the convention
in 1787, and strengthened with such care
by Hamilton and the Federalists in Con
gress, would have fallen to the ground.
Washington, seeing the danger, prevailed
upon Patrick Henry to come forward in
defense of the national authority, and
this he did. though Teak from sickness
and years, with an outburst of patriotic
ardor which brought to mind his ancient
fire. This speech was answered by Ran
dolph, who upheld the sovereignty of the
States as against the nation, and this
was the first important occasion on which
he displayed that eloquence which was
always po effective with a Southern audi
ence.
He -went to Congress and was several
times re-elected by his faithful constltu
: ents. Once also he wns sent to the Senate
:to complete an unexpired term. The most
i important part of his Congressional ca
| reer began in 1801. The Republicans had
elected Jefferson and a majority of the
; House of Representatives, and so had
j come "into power," as we use the term.
! Macon of â¢ North Carolina was chosen
I Speaker, and he appointed Randolph
' chairman of the Ways and Moans Com-
I mittee. In that position he was, as Trent
says, "one of the most efficient and thor
â  oughgoing party leaders on the floor of
' the House of Representatives that have
been produced since the birth of the na-
I tion." Later, during Jefferson's second
' term, he went Into opposition and became
the leader of a small faction called the
'â  "Quids," and thenceforth, in the words of
Trent, "was the most pertinacious and
personally dreaded free-lance in politics
1 that this country has ever known."
In ISOI the great obstacle in the way of
' the Republicans, who wished to keep the
| nation from gaining ground at the cx
i pense of the States, was the national
Judiciary, for as long: as the Federal court
i could interpret the laws of Congress and
! pass upon their constitutionality it had
the advantage in determining the relation
which national and State forces should
' bear to each other. Quite at the close of
John Adams' administration Circuit
I Courts had been organized and Judges
from the Federalist party had been ap
, pointed to rill the new places. To get rid
i of these Judges was the effort of the Re
! publicans, assisted by Randolph. It was
'- conceded that they could not be disposed
of by direct removal, nor by reduction of
I salary. The constitution too plainly for
i bade a resort to either method. But could
I not the Circuit Courts themselves be
I abolished? Such a question might have
i been expected from the Federalists, who
I stood boldly for a broad construction of
the constitution and for limiting the gen
eral Government to the exercise of those
'â â  powers alone which were plainly given to
it in the constitution. The right to abol
ish a Federal court could be found only
among those "implied powers" for using
! which the Federalists had been attacked
Iby the Republicans. But party expedi-
I ency prevailed over consistency, the Cir-
c uit Court system, in so far as it called
for a separate grade of Judges, was abol
ished by the repeal of the judiciary law
of 1801. and so the most important of
I Adams' "midnight appointees" were re
i turned to private life.
The next important administration
measure was the purchase of Louisiana,
and in supporting this Randolph went
even farther than Jefferson himself, for,
while the latter desired an amendment
to the constitution to legalize the pur
chase, Randolph considered an amend
ment unnecessary. That is to say, the
Republicans were at liberty to stretch the
constitution, although the Federalists had
been roundly denounced for doing the
Hrimo thing- while they were in power.
Furthermore, he approved of making the
purchase without any reference of the
matter to the States, although the large
increase in the number of the latter,
likely to be carved in future out of the
immense Louisiana territory, made the
purchase a matter in which the existing
Statea had the most vital interest. Hence
i in these two great mattersâ the repeal of
I the judiciary law and the purchase of
. Louisianaâ Randolph's action contradicted
his avowed principles in the matters of
State sovereignty and a limited national
â  government
Courts of the lower grades might be
abolished by act of Congress, but the
Supreme Court could not be disposed of
â  in such an offhand manner, for it came
i into being not at the discretion of Con
gress but by express mandate of the con
: Ptitution. It was thus protected by the
very principle which had been used to get
rid of the Circuit Courtâ i. c., that the
i power to create carries with it the power
,to destroy. Accordingly, unless the eon
; ptitution were changed, the only way In
! which a Supreme Court Judge couM be

and misdemeanors, and they were not
ready to use the serious process of im
peachment as a purely political weapon.
So they turned instead on one of his col
leagues, whose course had furnished some
basis for an attack.
Justice Chase of the Supreme Court wa3
a learned and upright Judge, who dis
charged his duties well in ordinary case: .
| But he was a violent partisan Federalist,
and permitted his party bias to be plainly
seen when matters involving party ques
| tions came before him. He thus incurred
| the hatred of the Republicans, and they
I set to work to remove him by the pr
of impeachment. The House appointed
managers, chief among whom was Ran
i dolph, and upon him fell the principal
I burden of conducting the prosecution. He
! could not have undertaken a task for
: which he was less fitted. The occasion
called for a thorough knowledge of law,
; and this Randolph did not possess. It
! also called for good judgment in deciding
j on the line of attack, and a dignified,
! forcible presentation of the case, and here
; again he was deficient. None of the arts
: of the political stump orator nor the pow
i ers of invective which he used so much
in the place of argument could serve him
now. At the bar of the Senate his au
: thority as leader of the House availed
! him nothing. Opposed to him as counsel
) for Chase were some of the foremost
! lawyers in the country, among them Lu
ther Martin, "the Federal bulldog," who
! enjoyed nothing more than exposing Ran
dolph's weaknesses. It was a rare oppor
j tunity for the Federalist champion to pay
I off old scores for his party. Randolphs
discomfiture was complete. Toward the
close of the trial he broke down, wan
i dering aimlessly in his talk, frequently
; complaining of the loss of hi? notes and
; practically throwing himself on the pity
| of those whom he had set out to instruct
I and convince. A more humiliating posi
tion could hardly be imagined for a man
of his imperious nature, accustomed to
rule and to bear down without mercy
upon those who came in his way. Judge
Chase was acquitted, the attack on the
Supreme Court failed and Randolphs
prestige received a blow from which It
did not recover.
For the sake of Randolph's reputation
it is pleasant to turn from his defeat to
his manly contest against the Vazoo
frauds. Theso constituted, in the early
part of the century, a famous political
scandal in which marly all the Legisla
ture of Georgia was implicated. Tho mat
ter at stake was the disposal of certain
great tracts of public land, in which It
turned out that the members of. the r.p-j>
lature had a pecuniary interest. Rand
exposed the scandal fearlessly. Into the
fight against corruption he threw himself
with fierce energy. When ho wished to
ruin a man politically ho would hring
against him the charge of being a "Ya
: zoo man." Indeed, in his bitter hostility
to everything "Yasoo" be wi nt too far,
for he opposed, and for a while prevented
a settlement of the matter by Conr
which aimed to protect innocent pu:
era of thÂ«* hinds. But on the whole, this
part 01 his career showed in a favorable
light his personal honesty and the high
standard of service for men in public life
Upon which he then insisted.
His constructive work aa a statesman
consisted in laying tho foundations of
Southern political supremacy in national
(iffaira. This he did by making a skillful
| use of adherrneo to Stato sovereignty and
devotion to slavery, which were already
; characteristic of his section. Altta
' there was no necessary connection be
tween the two, yet on the whole they
wnt together, both growing stronger at
the South, while they were disappearing
at the North. Randolph saw that the two
could be made to support each other and
become the basis of a controlling force,
afterward called from its most obtrusive
i element the "slave power." In building
up this power Randolph was the forerun
ner of Calhoun. who elaborated his views
j and became tho chief agent in developing
at the South that attitude toward national
affairs which led for awhile to the dom
inance of that section, but eventually to
secession and the civil war. That, as we
know, led to the destruction of sla
and the doctrine of State sovereignty and
so to the complete overthrow of that
school of statesmanship which Randolph
| did so much to establish.

EASTERN MARKETS,

NEW YORK, Nov. The stock market took
on a show of great animation and strength to
day and some very striking net pains resulted.
The general list, however, though higher in
price at the close, developed little activity.
The operations which totaled 9.10,206 shares
Bold, were largely confined to the professional
element. The upward movement was obviously
based upon the notably easier tone of. the |
money market. The largest operations were
ny powerful pools and strong financial interests
which have command of money resources out
side of the usual money market circles. The
prevailing opinion in Wall street Is that prices
of stocks would move upward easily If the oh-
Btacle of stringent money were removed. The
large outstanding short interest In stocks has
been palpably uneasj- for some time past and j
any indication of relaxation In the tightness
of money makes them inclined to cover their
short contracts. The professional pool oper
ations in a number of prominent stocks to-day
were obviously directed against â¢ ':â¢â  bear con

probable, however, that the large buying at
other points is based on expectation of a rise
,in prices on account of a growing Interest in
stocks.
It is the period of the year in -which, under
normal circumstances, the extra uses for
â money In the moving of the crops begin to
show diminution, releasing large funds from
employment in stock speculation. Expert opin
ion, however. Is by no meanp unanimous that
funds will be released in the usual volume this
fall, owing to the marvelous expansion In busi- j
ngs. Outside the highly speculative indus- !
trials the movement in the railroads centered In j
the Southwestern group. The. special strength l
and activity In Southern Pacific helped the i
Southwestern and was based on current ;
rumors of readjustment of control. :
The belated movement in cotton was â  factor
'of strength among Southern and Southwestern
railroads. There were special movements be
. Hides In Big Four and Che^peake and Ohio,
and some demand for the coalers.
The upward movement In the Iron and steel
Ftocks encountered difficulties hs did that In
Brooklyn Transit. Speculation in Leather con
tinued on an enormous scale, the stock rising :
an extreme 3%. Sugar was also very prominent
and rose at one time five points. There were
notable movements in Standard Rope, People's
Qua' and Manhattan. The extent of the ad
vance Invited heavy realizing, especially dur
ing the last hour and some stocks showed re
actions of between 1 and 2 points from the
highest, The general tendency was yielding.
In spite of a fresh advance In Southern Pacific
to 11% and in Chesapeake and Ohio to 23. ThÂ«
upward Impetus nt the opening was caused by
higher quotations from London, and the effect
was exaggerated by the. circulation of a canard
alleging a disastrous defeat of the Boers at
Ladysmlth. Manipulation for the rise was very
apparent all day.
The bond market was active and strong, thÂ»
demand being well distributed. Total sales,
par value, $3,395,000.

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, Nov. Wheat opened weak and
' showed very little recuperative power. Prices
i remained below yesterday's level throughout
! the session. Nearly everything was against
: the market and long Wheat came out In large
quantities. The principal weakening Influence
was the excess of visible stocks this year com-
I pared with last and the fact that dally ad
â¢ ditions are being made to the oversupply. At
j this time last year there were but 15,000,000
bushels in the visible, whereas now there are
40,000,000 bushels. Of this amount 20,000,000
bushels are stored in Chicago against only 3,
--000,000 a year ago. Heavy cables and the
promising condition of the winter Wheat, to
gether with an excessively slack cash demand,
encouraged the selling movement. Near the
end of the session covering by shorts started
a slight rally, but the market closed weak
within %c of the bottom. December opened
%c lower at 69 1 ,t,'569%c. sold sparingly at 69% c,
declined to 6S%e and closed with sellers at
68 7 /t,c.
Corn was active but weak with Wheat.
Light clearances, a slow cash demand and an
estimate by a prominent statistician that the
world's corn crop would amount to 2.605, 000,000,
against 2,446,000,000 bushels last year, also en
couraged selling, under which the market de
| clined steadily until late in the session, when
claims of disappointing husking returns, to
gether with covering by shorts caused some
reaction. December closed at 307b<&'31c.
Sympathy with the other grains and heavy
commission-house selling of the December op
tioned weakened OatÂ«. New estimates which
! made a considerable Increase In the world's
I supply of Oats also had a depressing influence
December closed at 22%@22%c.
! A larger decrease In stocks than expected
I strengthened Provisions early, but the market
! finally yielded under heavy selling by pack
j ers. 1 The weakness In grains was also a handi
cap. January Pork, after an advance of 10c
closed a shade lower at $9 60. January Lard
a shade lower at $5 25 and January Ribs a
shade higher at $4 90Â®4 92%.

Hay and Feedstuff
There Is no further change in Feedstuffg, ex- I
cept a slight decline in Rolled Barley. Hay
continues firm for choice dry stock. The cir
cular of Somers & Co. says:
"Again we note a week of light receipts, j
even lighter than for the week preceding, the |
total amount received for the week being about
2500 tons. There Is still the cry from all sec
tions of the country for cars for the shipment
of Hay. and, no doubt, if plenty could be se
cured shipments would be heavier.
"Much of the Hay now coming in Is re- ;
ceived In a damaged condition, and is being j
worked 'iff with much difficulty and then only
at very low prices. Good Hay in a dry condi
tion Is selling fairly well, and for choice Hay
we note a very good market with prices some- j
what higher. We think that after the damaged
Hay is cleared oft the market we will
tee somewhat better prices for all grades of
Hay, although we do not expect any material
advance.
"About 600 tons of Alfalfa have arrived dur
inK the week, most of which has been received
In a damaged condition. It is very hard to dis
pose or this Hay, even at very low prices, but
sound Alfalfa Is bringing good figures. When
the damaged Alfalfa has been disposed of we
expect the market for this grade of Hay to ad
vance somewhat."

UNCONFIRMED HERE.
Reported Sale of the Stanford_South^
em Pacific Stock a Surprise.
As was the case when the sale of the
Crocker interests in the Southern Pacific
Company was first reported, the utmost
secrecy is maintained regarding the saie
of the Stanford interest.- which was re
ported yesterday in the dispatches from
New York. Mrs. Stanford is in New lorK
with her attorney. Mr. Huntingdon is out
of town, and Charles Lathrop, brother to
Mrs. Stanford, says he knows absolutely
nothing about the reported sale save that
which he bus seen In the newppapern.
The report may be true, and it it is.
Mrs. Stanford Bhould have received some
thing like SH.iKm ' â¢*Â»Â«" ''â 
stocK in the Southern Pacific i pmpany.
besides the money she would get from tne
sale of her interests in the Pacific Im
provement Company.
It was generally believed that Mrs.
Stanford had gi\en her railroad sto
the Leland Stanford Jr. University
time ago. Jn fact, the statement was
made to that effect and accepted as true
by every one. I: that was so, it is rather
hard to conceive how she could have so.d
that which she no longer possessed.
The sale of the Stanford stot k will make
but little difference in the policy of the
road. The Stanford and Crocker lnt<
combined were Btrong enough to glvi
shrewd old -entleman at the head of the
corporation all he could do to mal
his sway. But with the Crocker shares
not only out of the way but in the hands
of the enemy, Mrs. Stanford was prac
tically powerless t.. make her in!'
felt In the management of the company
in which she had so much capital in
vested.
If the stock has been purchased, it is
almost ;>. certainty thut C. P. Huntington
is the man who has bought it: and this.
together with the Crocker interests, which
are now his. and his own original hold-
Ings, makes him I i all intents and pur
poses the sole owner of the largest rail
way system in the world.
REMEMBERED HIS EMPLOYES.

H. H. Dunlap, proprietor of a lodging

THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 1899.
ALEXANDER COULD NOT
STAND FRIEND'S CENSURE
Death Was His Ref
uge From Attacks
of His Superior.
â Â« â
Drowned Himself While
His Case Was Being
Defended.
OAKLAND. Nov. 2.-Chas. O. Alex
ander, Assistant Postmaster, con
cerning whom rumors of a short
age in the Oakland Postoffice have
been circulated widely the past
few days, committed suicide late this aft
ernoon by drowning in the estuary of San
Antonio.
The suicide was very determined, and is
particularly sad, from the fact that he
died in total ignorance of the fact that
his two most influential friends, Senator
Perkins and Congressman Metcalf, were
.'ding with the postal authorities at
Washington, while he was wallowing in
the mire, to defer any action in the mat
ter of the shortage until they should
reach Washington.
Alexander's body was found lying on
the mud ilats oft the foot of Seventeenth
avenue, East Oakland, shortly after 5
o'clock by Thomas Weingart, residing on
East Fourteenth street. Weingart had
gathering drift wood on the incom
ing tide. His little boat was loaded and
as he pulled toward the old Derby wharf
near the East Oakland tanneries he saw
a row boat adrift and near it what ap
-1 pea red to him to be a dog. Investigation
revealed the object to be the body of a
. man, and lie quickly hauled the remains
aboard his craft and rowed to the wharf.
; The Coroner was immediately summoned
te body taken to the Morgue.
The boat from which Alexander leaped
to his death belonged to Captain Kred
Fa Ikm an of the schooner Charles Levy
Woodberry, lying in the estuary. Captain
: Falkman "had rowed to the foot of Thir
i teenth avenue.
There he tied up his rowboat and went
on business to Bast Oakland. When he
returned he found his boat floating out
toward the stream and opposite the
] (erby wharf. Falkman procured another
craft and secured his boat. In it he found
a hat and coat, which were late to-night
turned over to Sergeant Clarke of the Po
lice Department and taken to the
Morgue. But In its pockets nothing was
: In the way of a farewell message
te touching upon the cause for the
suicide.
Alexander was seen on Broadway at 1
k this afternoon by F. A. Wasley of
\\ . st street. The two men conversed
. and Wasley states that Alexander
set mcd down-hearted, but he will not
state the nature of the conversation.
Later Alexander visited the Macdonough
Theater bar.
Prom there he Is supposed to have gone
to Blast Oakland. Firemen at the Thir
teenth avenue engine house say they
saw him walk down toward the foot of
the avenue to the water about 3:30 o'clock.
It is presumed that the dreadful impulse
Of self-destruction seized the unfortunate
man, for he untied Captain Falkman's
boat and rowed out into the stream. The
DINSLAGE MAY GET
A DIVORCE DECREE
OAKLAND, X'>v. 2â The divorce suit of
Mary Dinslage against Herman Dinslage,
brought on the ground of cruelty, has
. ci upled nearly a week of Judge Greene's
' attention, and while his Honor has de
i that -Mrs. I>inslage is not entitled
to a decree) the court is rather In a quan
i dary as to whether the husband Is
: entitled to a decree on his cross-com
plaint, for Dinslage has admitted that on
two occasions he had slapped his wife's
face.
Mrs. Dinslage Is of French extraction
the husband of Herman, and the fact
that the latter frequently conversed with
i hts brother In German added to the wife's
, troubles.
Judge Greene has now given the attor
-1 . ys until next Monday to look up the law
to whether under the circumstances
Dinslage Is entitled to a divorce.
SOUTHERN PACIFIC HAS
ACKNOWLEDGED ERROR
OAKLAND, Nov. 2.â The Southern Pa
cific Is anxious t" make a better showing
and lias issued the following order to
trainmen:
I am inclined to believe that there is not
proper attention given as to the merchandise
that your train contains when leaving terminal
points. Also, when picking up loads, some of
you are not giving attention so that you may
know whether your engine is loaded to its ca
pacity or overloaded. On receipt of this I want
you to check up the merchandise before leaving
terminal points and note the same on your
train register. If you discover that your train
contains more merchandise than your engine
Is rated for, you will request trainmaster or
yardmaster to reduce your tra.n to rating of
your engine, providing you do not have to set
out perishable or rush cars. I ask that special
attention be given to 'his, bo that we may
bring our tonnage up and make a better show
ing than in the past. In case your engine can
not handle the train and make its time. I want
full particulars wired why.

lervices, paid a fitting tribute to the rec
ord of the deceased and in his remarks
said: "The modesty and the simple life of
our departed brother would not allow o,f
my applying in any extended eulogy to
him these considerations. It therefore
only remains to say that he lived n use
ful life, along with many other of these
pioneers, In upbuilding the community
and laying the foundations of a health
ful civic life. His gentleness of nature
was shown by his Insisting upon having
each in turn of ninny of his associates

him at his bedside for a last farewell "
After Burris' Scalp.
OAKLAND, Nov. 2.â Miss Jane Kellev
a domestic, is out after Attorney J [>'
minis' scalp. She applied to Deputy Dis
trict Attorney Samuels to-day for a war
rant against Burris, alleging that he had
obtained tV< lrom her under false pre
tences. Sue said she had nlaced a claim
for wages with a collection agency and
once, when she visited the agency's
headquarter*, she found Burris there 1
that he represented himself a member of
the agency and she paid him $10 for serv
ices in connection with the claim, and
that he never performed any services. In
asmuch as the receipt read "for services
to bo performed," Samuels did not believe
the false pretense charge would stick.
C. O. ALEXANDER.
i tide still coming in carried the craft east
-1 ward and when opp >Bite Seventeenth ave
nue Alexander, divesting himself of his
coat and hat, jumped Into uue water.
! Though shallow water. Alexander must
: have become very determined now, for
i presently the tide begat] to ebb, and. ac
cording to P. Deick of the union Hotel,
| Charles Magnes of 916 East Fourteenth
i street and Joseph Elliott of 1109 Sixteenth
i street, they saw Alexander wallowing in
Â» he soft mud. frequently throwing his
' body forward as if diving, and thus he
struggled until, exhausted, death came to
his relief.
It was impossible for the Coroner's
! deputies to secure Alexander's coat. Cap
! tain Falkman had taken it In his boat to
! his schooner and the tide had ebbed until
j several hundred feet of mud stretched
! from the wharf to the water's edge and
I the coat was not secured until late to
i night.
All evening and until nearly midnight.
I the Morgue was thronged with visitors
jto view the remains. Among them was
! Postmaster W. 11. Friend, who express-. 1
â  his deepest sorrow. A bunch of keys be
! longing to the Postoffice found in one of
; the dead man's pockets was turned over
i to Mr. Friend and lie did not tarry long.
Later Senator St rat ton and F. E. Brig
' ham, brother-in-law of the deceased,
I called at the Morgue, and they suhse
' quently broke the news to Mrs. Alexan
-1 der at her home. 1440 Bast Sixteenth
i street. The unfortunate woman had sur
i mised the end. Her husband had spent
a restless night. At breakfast he had
agreed to accompany her to luncheon at
the Brighams' on Oak street, and his ab
sence had s.i worried her that she had
| feared the worst.
Of the many friends who called at the
Morgue none but expressed the deepest
Borrow and attributed Alexander's rash
act to temporary insanity.

County politics for many years. In 1592
he was nominated by acclamation for

NEW SYMPHONY
CLUB RESUMES
WORK AT LAST
Mrs. Pheba Hearst the
Patroness.
HOLMES CHOSEN LEADER
PROF. WILLIAM CAREY JONES
IS PRESIDENT.
â â¢
A few weeks aco The Call made the
announcement that there was trouble in
the Symphony Society and that the mem
bers were highly indignant because of > ie
carelessness of the officers in m king ar
rangements for a new series of concerts.
The article further stated that in case I
nothing: Is done within a reasonable time, j
preparations will be made to organize a I
separate body, whose purpose it shall be
to commence a movement to reorganize
the symphony concerts. The meeting has
finally been held, and the following com
mittee has taken charge of affairs. It
must be understood that this commutee
is in no way connected with the old |
Symphony Society, but will direct matters j
according to its own ideas.
The committee consists of Professor
William Carey Jones of the University
of California, chairman; H. B. Pasmore,
Robert Tolmie, J. N. Odell, W. A. Sabln, !
and Mesdames J. N. Odell, A. r". Morri- â 
son. J. N. Goewey, James Tucker, C. O. ,
Richardson and J. J. Price. Mrs. Phebe
Hearst, in accordance with her usual
desire to aid beneficial movements, i.as
kindly donated the sum of $2000 for 'he
purpose of commencing the concerts.
And her main desire in acting thus
generously was to enable the new society
to defray expenses so that the musicians
may receive their price of $8 per concert,
which she claims is by right due them.
The conductor will be Henry Holmes, a
musician who has had a great deal of ex
perience in this kind of work, and i/bo
possesses exceedingly flattering tesi.
monlals from the foremost musical
authorities. He was until recently a
member of the Royal Conservatory of
Music in London, and has a splendid
record In Europe. He recently organized
a chamber music quartet in 'his city
which will begin concerts next Tuesday
at Century Club Hall.
Mrs. Hearst hopes that her donation
will create an interest among he sub
scribers to the old symphony conceits,
and spur them on to encourage a move
ment which is so essential to musical
progress in San Francisco. The .Irst
symphony concert will take place at the
Grand Opera-house on Thursday. Decem
ber 7. at 2:30 o'clock p. m. Professor
Jones, who was very prominently men
tioned for president for the University of
California a short time ago, is a man of
great executive ability, and will no doubt
prove a iplendid presiding officer. The
committee put Itself on record as an able
body of people by arranging a scale of
prices which will enable every student, bo
he every so deficient of means, to attend
them. The seating capacity of tne opera
house permits a 25-cent admission fee,
and for this purpose the family circle or
balcony has been selected. The other
prices will range as usual.
MILES IN WASHINGTON.
SEATTLE, Nov. 2.â General Nelson A.
Miles and party arrived here at noon to
day and left this evening for an inspec
tion of the new army fortifications at i
Port Townsend. He declined to discuss j
the Philippine situation further than to
say that peace depended upon circum
stances and that he would, go to the Phil
ippines if ordered. Of Puget Sound he
"This section is not only desirable but
suitable and favorably looked upon as a I
base of supplying the needs of the I nited :
States army in the Philippines. There Is |
no route that is superior for the shipment |
of both troops and animals on account
of the cooler atmosphere that prevails on
this Sound. More shipping will be done
from here and return shipments will prob
ably be made to Puget Sound at no dis
tant date. The westward posts I have
visited I have found satisfactory."

strong position he took for making teach
ing a profession. He said the schools are
no place for women to rest awaiting mat
rimony, or for men hoping to get into
law or business. Teaching must be the
end and aim of teachers.

HORACE DAVIS
LABOR'S CHAMPION
Continued from Seventh Page.
experience; they have in no degree im
paired his energy ur dulled his apprecia
tion of the rights and needs of the labor
ing man. If the labor organizations have
ceased to pass resolutions praising him
for his good work in their behalf it is be
cause he has during the past few years
withdrawn to a great degree from active
participation in politics, and not because
be has ceased to be deserving of their
good will. If Horace Davis was deserv
ing of the enthusiastic support and praises
of the worklngmt.'ii of San Francisco
twenty, fifteen or ten years ago he Is de
serving of them now. If the hardy toilers
who delighted to honor their champion
in those years when he was battling for
them in "the halls of Congress and who
has always shown a kindly interest in
their welfare as an employer and as a
citizen still retain the old feeling of af
fection for the man Horace Davis will be
elected. He has never done anything to
mar his splendid record as the true friend
of the laboring man. and if he is placed
in the Mayor's chair he will give San
Francisco an honest, capable administra
tion, and the rights of tho toilers will re
ceive as much consideration as those of
any other cla.^s of citizens. No one who
knows Horace Davis doubts this.
HON. HORACE DAVIS
AMONG HIS FRIENDS
Honest Workingmen Cheer the
Republic n Nominees.
The workingmen of the Twenty-eighth
District filled every inch of sitting and
standing room in the large hall at Folsom
and Second streets last night. The meet
ing was presided over by Thomas Bryant,
who in a few well-chosen words intro
duced the speakers of the evening, the
first of whom was Hon. Horace Davis.
The appearance of the next Mayor of San
Francisco was thfr-occasion for an ovation
from the hard-working men of the section
of the city where Mr. Davis had given
employment to thousunds of laborers for
a number of years and where every man
and woman in the neighborhood was
ready to vouch for kindness of heart and
liberality to such as needed his assisU
ance in the days gone by.
In the few remarks made by Mr. Davis
ho was applauded to the echo, and on his
departure from the platform he was
stepped in the body of the hall by hun
dreds of the men who knew him personal
ly and assured of their votes on next
Tuesday.
Among the Republican nominees who
made short addresses were: C. L. Nagle,
W. Watson, Judge JT. L. Joachimsen, C.
A. Low, W. '/.. Tiffany. W. A. Deane and
J. H. Scott. Alfred J. Morganstern, R.
B. McClellan and Major C. W. Kyle spoke
for the general ticket. The appearance of
Martin Kelly in the body of the hall
br< ught forth a round of cheers, which
would not down until he was forced to
ascend the rostrum, where he said: "I
am out for the Republican ticket from top
to bottom. I have been a Republican all
my life, and tho Examiner cannot drive
me out of the party. I ask you one and
nl! to vote the entire Republican ticket."
(.Cheers.)
REPUBLICAN RALLY
IN THE THIRTY-THIRD
Plain Exposition of the Issues
of the Present Campaign.
The Republicans of the Thirty-third
Assembly District held an enthusiastic
rally at Mission Opera Hall last evening.
The fact that competent and interesting
speakers would speak on the vital issues
that affect the present campaign served
to attract a large and intelligent audience,
among which were a number of ladies.
Seated on the stage were Martin Jones i
chairman. Secretary Ralph Nathorn and i
Z. I. Dodge; County < 'ommitteemen J. j
K. C. HobbÃ, M. V. Taylor, Z. T. Barber!
and H. C. Henderson, and several gentle- j
men who acted as vice pfesidi ots, be
sides several candidates who appeared
during the evening.
The first speaker was Hon. F. X.
Schoonmuker, whose able and convincing i
talk on the prominent part which national j
issues play in this election won for him
earnest attention and hearty applause, j
When he f aid that it was "not a question ]
of men. Imt of destiny, and the election
of Horace Davis meant a continuation of |
McKlnley'fl policy, which has placed Call- I
fornla on the very pinnacle of prosperity,"
tho applause was deafening and continued j
for some time.
Irving M. Scott was the next speaker, !
and his appeal for the earnest support !
df the itiz^ns of the community for !
Horace Davis, whom he regarded as the ;
highest type of American manhood, also j
met with the deserved plaudits of tho
gathering.
I'.ivid .1. Murphy told of the good deeds
of the Republican candidate for the j
Mayoralty in aiding tho poor pÂ«-ople in !
dark timiÂ»s of poverty, and the following
candidates prumised to properly carry out j
the duties of the respective offices for j
which they aspire: Dr. A. D. McLean, G.
H. Jackson, Douis Feusier, John Farn
hnm, represented by R. 1.,. Hathorn;
Judge Joachimsen, George Shaw, Dr. E.
N Torello, S. Foster and Colonel T. V.
Eddy.
SHOUTS AND CHEERS
FOR REPUBLICANS
Horace Davis' District Turns
Out in Large Numbers.
Plxley Hall, on the corner of Polk and
Pacific streets, was packed to the street
| last night when Chairman Brandt called
the meeting to order. It was a Repub
lican gathering of the Forty-first District,
j the club of which has for its president
Horace Davis.
No band or bonfire was needed to fill
i the hall with eager, enthusiastic voters,
yet both of these political adjuncts were
furnished. According to the programme
the candidates were to start from Pixley
Hall and then go the rounds. There was
some delay in their arrival, but the crowd
which filled every nook and cranny of the
hall manifested no Impatience and lis
tened with rapt attention to the district
orator, Sidney M. Ehrman.
When Mr. Davis arrived the enthusiasm
knew no bounds and the shout of wel
come was carried down the hall and out
on the street, where many who could not
be accommodated with seats were stafld
lng. Not for some time has there been
I such a spirited meeting in the Forty-first
and everything presages a return to the
old-time Republican majorities.
JAMES H. BUDD AT
B'NAI B'RITH HALL
Eulogized Democratic Candi=
dates at the Reed Meeting.
Friends of Charles Wesley Reed, of
Pholanism and others convened at B'nai
B'rith Hall last evening, as Presiding
Chairman Jamefl O'Brien put it, "to listen
to words of wisdom on municipal Issues
and to listen to a Bpeech by the superb
r.-f'Ttner on State lines, who was a re
former before reform was thought of. ex-
Cowrnor Budd. " Mr. Budd was warmly
greeted by the crowd and then began to
assail those who hud Incorporated na
tional issues wi'h local Issues during tho
campaign. He eulogized Heed to some
extent, dwelt at length on his statement
thai the â¦government of San Francisco
cost the people ft sum as large as that
required to conduct the State government
ami rt-tired. _,
In his address Governor Budd said:
The 'only mistake I think our democratic
brethren madeâ and I am frank enough when I
think a ihlnp to say Itâ is in that portion of
tin- jilatfnrm Whers 'hey try to draw in State
Issues. This Is Inconsistent with our attitude
In this fiÃht and entirely outside the limits of
municipal concerns. Now, we are not on a
State platform. We are on a local platform.
With the exception of myself all the speakers
here to-night are citizens of San Francisco.
The portion of the platform which invaded the
province of the State on the water front Is
that portion which essays to criticize the port
charges. This criticism is unfounded. It was
therefore politically unwise and logically In
correct. It is a fact susceptible of the most
positive proof that the port charg-es of San
Francisco will compare favorably with tfeOM of
any large harbor in the world, and I desire to
say that the management of the present Board
â¢if Harbor Commissioners Is economical and
efficient. Under a law passed by the last
Legislature, reinforced by the wise action of
the present executive and the other members of
the Board of Examiners, greater economy Is
practiced than ever before. The present reform
movement In San Francisco In the Democratic
party Involves citizenship in its highest and
besi sense, and we cannot afford to be either
unjust or unfair with ourselves any more than
with our Republican neighbors.
Mr. Reed then addressed the gath- I
erlngr, saying in part that after the
Democratic Board of Supervisors came
into power the school children would not ;
be forced to walk over rotten boards and i
go home a walking pestilence, but true to |
their pledge the Democrats would spend
$1.000,<M) on new schools, $150,000 improving j
others, $5/>OO.OOO on sowers.
John J. Barrett and Peter J. Curtis,
Democratic nominee for Supervisor, also
addressed the meeting, after which the
crowd, rilled to the brim by words of
wisdom delivered by men who were re
formers when reform was unknown, filed
out into the open.
FORTIETH IS STRONG
FOR HORACE DAVIS
Spirited Meeting of Republicans
at Franklin Hall.
Franklin Hall, on Fillmore street, near
Bush, resounded with cheers for Horace
Davis last night. The citizens of the
Fortieth came early, and before the meet
ing 1 was called to order by Chairman J.
T. Williams the large hall was packed
with voters.
Men flocked from all over the district
to hear the speakers, and they did not
stint applause or enthusiasm. Edmund
Tauszky. Lucius Solomons and Myron
"Wolfe entertained the audience by bright
speeches in which campaign issues re
ceived a fair and honest consideration.
Horace Davis entered the hall later in
the evening and was cheered to the echo.
If the Fortieth District meeting last night
is a criterion there will be a Republican
sweep there next Tuesday. The candi
dates dropped in from time to time and
spoke for themselves and the ticket. The
enthusiasm, which was at no time lack
ing, was spontaneous and expressive.
PHOENIX CLUB HOLDS
A ROUSING MEETING
Horace Davis Enthusiastically
Received by a Big Audience.
. The Phoenix Republican Club held a
rousing meeting last night at Scottish
Hail. Tne spacious hall was crowded to
the doors and the enthusiasm ran high.
General A. 1... Hart presided. When Hon.
Horace Davis arrived the audience rose
and cheered him to the echo. Mr. Davis
discussed the issues of the campaign and
was heartily applauded from time to time
during his remarks.
Among the candidates who addressed
the meeting were Edwin M. Sweeney,
Charles G. Nagle and L.. G. Carpenter,
candidates for Police Judge; John Lack
mann, candidate for Sheriff; Albert
Heyer, candidate for Assessor; William
A.'Peane. candidate for County Clerk,
and Joseph 11. Scott, candidate for Tax
Collector.
PHELAN SPEAKS AT
POTRERO MEETING
Mayor Phelan spoke nt the open air
meeting held near the Union Iron Works
last night and was well received. In his
speech he told how he had visited the
camp of the enemyâ the gas company â
and found Intelligent men employed there
who coincided with him and his political
views. He said that he felt satisfied that
with the assistance of the Australian bal
lot system the laboring men's votes would
be cast for the Democratic party.
''The opposition, the Pie-publican party,
says that the Mayor will have 6000 posi
tions to fill, and they try to prove it with
I figures," said the Mayor. "I say that
I there are but thirty-three appointments
to be made, and three of these are posi
tions in the Mayor's office. While it is
true that this is a source of weakness, I
would like to have those 6000 appoint
ments. When the opposition dwells so
strongly on the matter of immense power
of the next Mayor, I think that under a
Republican administration the office
would be one of danger. It is right that
I municipal elections should be (Separated
| from national ones."
After leaving the open air meeting, the
Mayor spoke at a meeting at Eighteenth
| and Florida streets. During the Mayor's
j speech, and after a burst of applause
' which greeted a remark of Mr. Phelan
had subsided, a voice from the back of
the hall shouted, "Never mind, we'll
â  make you Senator yet!" to which the
i Mayor replied that natioual issues should
â¢ be eliminated from municipal affairs.
Mayor Phelan also spoke at the Y. M.
C. A. gymnasium at Hill and Valencia
streets.
PANHANDLE PROJECT
MEANS CONFISCATION
Continental League Voices the
Protests of Citizens.
The Continental League of Republican
Clubs, voicing the opinions of hundreds of
voters and property holders along the line
and within reach of the results of Mayor
Phelan's panhandle scheme, have drafted
and adopted the following resolutions:
Whereas.' Lnet year Hon. James D. Fhelan
was a gold bug. this year a conundrum, some
kind of a Democrat, partly gold, partly silver,
a mixture of a non-partisan, a clalmer of Re
publican Ideas and measures -while fishing for
Republican votes; and
Whereas. Mayor Phelan. with an eye to wind
ward looking for the main chance recommends
the Issuance of $10,000,000 worth of bonds by the
people to continue the park panhandle, and in
our opinion the immediate extension of the
park panhandle to the Intersection of Market
street and Van N'ees avenue will materially
enhance the value of his large holdings of real
estate on Market Btreet cunt of the proposed
terminus of said park panhandle, while It will
throw a cold froet over the property of the peo
ple on Market street west of the proposed pan
handle and thÂ« entire Mission belt; therefor*
Veaolved. That we, the members of the Con
tinental League, will work for and vote for
Hon Horace David for Mayor because he is
a statesman, a stalwart Republican, a manu
facturer and employer of worklngmen; because
he favors a bond issue for the following needed
public Improvements:
Firstâ Needed hospitals for the care and com
fort of sick patients. â â¢- â¢:.'â ..
Secondâ Needed new sehoolhouses and large
yards and the Improvement of the sanitary and
other conditions of the old ones. .
Thirdâ New and Improved pavements on our
public streets, kept clean, and the abandonment
of the cobblestones.
Fourthâ Needed new, complete and effective
sewer system. â 
Fifthâ A salt water plant for the purpose of
extinguishing tires, flushing and purifying the
new sewer system, without which the system
would be of little value from a sanitary point
of view. .
Sixthâ The purchase of the garbage cre
matory and allowing the garbage gatherers to
dump their garbage free of cost, thereby lessen
ing lite expense to rent payers, nnd before It
waters its stock, floats it among the people and
charges the municipality five times Its value,
which Infant corporation has been nursed and
allowed to grow under Mayor Phelan's admin
istration, to enrich a few non-partisans favor
able to his nomination and election.
Beventhâ Purchasing or building other public
utilities, such as water, eaa, etc., whenever
bonds are Issued and It can be done to the
advantage and betterment of the city, j

GAMBLING Is again a recognized
industry of s.iti Francisco. Not
verj long ngo Chief of Police Lees
and Police Commissioner Gunst
quarreled over the expediency of
throwing the Town "wide open" and per
mitting the gamblers to ply their truffle
at least unmolested if not under thr
actunl protection of the police. The Chief
of Police objected then, but now his ob
jections have been silenced and his threat

a new and dangerous gambling house
established, He knows that under the
protection of certain State laws other
laws nnÂ» viHnted and that on one of the
mopt prominent thoroughfares of the city
a gambling house is bein^ conducted ut
terly without molestation. Its cappers
are abroad on every avenue inviting
trade. Its games are run "wide open"

and l..se their money .in any game that
strikes their fancy. Faro, roulette, per
centage poker, craps and other sanies
called by courtesy games of chance are

Visiting: horsemen, returning and com
ing soldiers, civilians. countrymen
and resident gullibles are victims of
the new robbery, and the police can nnlv
Bhrug their shoulders and ask an inquirer
mrhat they shall do. The history of the
new gambling venture is an interesting
one. Several months ago The Call ex
posed the fact thai a coterie of gamblers
Were conducting a Rambling ouirn in the
Palace Hotel. The proprietors wore reap
ing a rich harvest of ill-gotten gain. Men
of wealth and position were their patrons.
Their rooms were crowded nightly by men
â¢who had money to lose, and lost it cheer
fully.
The police were thoroughly informed of
the existence of the gambling house, but
Ihey saw fit to do nothing. The offense
against the laws was committed nightly
under their very eyes, but they saw noth
ing and did nothing. Joe Harvey, the
â wf-11-kno-wn gambler, was the master
spirit of the affair, and gossips said ritrhT
ly that he was a close and personal
friend of the Chief of Police and would
not be molested. When The Call made its
expose there, was a scampering for dark
ness and the Palace Hotel gambling house
became a lamented memory.
For pome time after its collapse no ef
iort was made to revive it. There was
trouble in the Police Commission. The
Commissioners and Chief Lees had trou
bles of their own, and the gamblers who
relied upon the good â will of the Chief
did not care to interject themselves at po
critical a Juncture. They decided to await
developments and to watch an opportun
ity to Invade again the local field. Their
lawyers delved deeply Into the law and
strove in many ways to discover a mean?
by which through the law they could
â cheat the laws. At last the avenue was
opened and the gamblers lost no time in
accepting its advantages.
The gamblers received their inspiration

from the Chinese. This perhaps is the
most curious feature of the whole affair.
The white gamblers were at their wits'
end until they saw what the cunning
Mongolians had done, and then they saw
that the opportunity for which they had
been seeking had come. It appears that
some time ago the gamblers of China
town discovered by some lucky chance a
cloak of protection in tho State laws.
Representatives of fraternal and benevo
lent Institutions had gone to Sacramento
and had induced the Legislature to en
dow societies and clubs, which were not
organized for gain, certain privileges
which protected the favored organiza
tions from tax and police espionage. The
clubs thus favored were permitted by
:;iw to Incorporate and under an amend
ment to the Civil Code were freed from
investigations and inquiries which, under
certain conditions, would have been dis
agreeable.
PHELAN'S TALES
QUEERED BY HIS
OWN WITNESSES
â¦
Grand Jury Vindi
cates Supervisors.
Another of the cheap political tricks
with which Mayor Phelan li;is character
ized his present campaign has fallen of
its own weight, and fallen hard. A com
mittee appointed yesterday by the Grand
Jury will call upon him to-day or to
morrow to apprise him of that fact. The
charges of wholesale fraud and knavery
recently brought by his Honor against
the Hospital Committee of the Board of
Supervisors have proved so utterly
groundless that the Jury has thrown the
whole case out of its calendar and
turned In disgust to matters of more
merit.
When a few weeks ago it became appar
ent that the City and County Hospital
could not be maintained upon the
amount set aside for It In. the tax sched
ule submitted by the Mayor, and that un
less more funds were immediately forth
coming it would have to close its doors
to the indigent sick of the city, his
Honor attempted to shirk all responsibil
ity for that deplorable condition and at
the same time make a bit of cheap politi
cal capital by setting up a cry of fraud.
He sought Ills typewriter and framed
charges of jobbery and extravagance
against the Hospital Committee, and he
set it forth clearly that if there had been
no jobbery the hospital could be run upon
the amount he had allowed It. These
statements, together with a list of wit
nesses, whom he sufgesied, would be com-
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 1599.
Attorneys employed by Chinese gam
| biers saw the tremendous advantage
j which this amendment to the law K-'ive
j them. Social clubs without number were
organised in the Chinese quarter. Chi
nese gamblers saw themselves liberated
| from the dominion of the police. They
I saw that an Incorporation as a social club
exempted them from the attacks of the
police and gave them an opportunity to
ply their gambling trade without inter
ruption. Their spike-studded doors were
removed Their close and careful watch
ing of the police was removed. Glass
doors were substituted for iron and steel
barricades, and under the protection of a
law that was intended to be a henefit to
fraternal and benevolent institutions the
Chinese plied their gambling trade.
The police were at a loss what to do.
But they took tho law into their own
bands and raided the new Chinese "so
cial" clubs. The glass doors were broken.
petent to point out just tho transactions
in which his alleged crookedness had oc
curred, lie laid before the Jury.
Believing that he acted in good faith
the jury at once instituted a most search
ing inquiry. One by one Mayor Phelan's
witnesses were called up, catechised and
turned loose again. Assessor Washington
Dodge, the Mayor's star witness, was one
of the first to be placed on the stand.
Mr. Podge was chairman of the Finance
Committee of the last Board of Super
visors, and if crookedness existed would
be well able to say when and where it
existed. Mr. Dodge, however, told
neither. His evidence consisted solely of
an admission that as chairman of that
committee he had violated the provisions
of the one-twelfth act about twelve times
in every year of his administration and
that at the end of the fiscal year he beat
even that by carrying over a deficit of
J2500 in the hospital fund. Mr. Dodge
went further than this. In answer to
direct questions be admitted that the hos
pital could not be conducted decently
upon the amount fixed by Phelan and that
it was one branch of the city's govern-
RECKLESSNESS OF A BOY
COST HIM HIS LIFE
HERCULES SCHWARTZ, a 14-year-old errand boy, employed by the
Wagner Leather Company at 306 Clay street, lost his life yesterday
morning while attempting to alight from a freight elevator In the build
ing at 27 Jessie street, occupied by the KaHt-Glanville Shoe Company.
Willie Miley of 621 Girard street was in char X( > of the elevator. He said
that young Schwartz, a stranger to him, came to the elevator door very early
in the day and asked whether he was going up with the elevator. Willie re
plled that he would start in a few moments, and went after a can of oil. As
soon as he had turned his back Hercules got upon the elevator and started
up. A moment or two later Miley was horrified by the sight of Schwartz's
body falling down the elevator shaft.
atiley gave the alarm and the body of the unfortunate boy was taken out
of the well and carried to the Harbor Emergency Hospital. He was uncon
scious, and shortly after the surgeons had shaved his head in order to dress
a fracture of the skull he expired. Young Schwartz's destination was the
third floor, and it is surmised that ho attempted to jump off the cage, not
knowing how to etop it, and fell down the shaft.
He was an industrious boy and was residing with his parents at 305 Eddy
street. Three weeks ago he went to work for the Wagner Leather Com
pany.
Jabbering Chinese were sent scampering
over roofs and into cellars. Gambling
games were broken up. although the po
lice paw that the ostentatiously placed
placards heralded the fact thru the raided
clubs enjoyed State protection and the
framed certificates of incorporation gave
them protection from police interference.
With consummate cunning the Chinese
had found in the laws of the State r right
to violate, other laws without molesta
tion.
After the raids the Chinese showed their
teeth. They resented the interference of
their traffic, and Patrick Crowley, who
was then chief of Police, was sued for
heavy damages. The case Is still pending
In court, but lawyers who have reason to
be well informed express the opinion that
the Chinese will win and that the law
which gives to social anil fraternal so
cieties the right of incorporation protects
them from police interference.
ment in which economy would work
nothing but harm.
Dr. Clinton, chairman of the hospital
committee of the last board, testified to
about the same thing, and like Mr. Dodge,
failed absolutely to point to any act to
the discredit of the Supervisors against
whom Pheian had laid charges. Will D.
Griffin, the Mayors $125 expert, failed as
blankly, notwithstanding he was hired by
his Uonr.r to expert hospital accounts anil
find anything that would make political
capital. The members of the Grand Jury
body realized at last that they had been
bunkoed; that his Honor, the Mayor, had
used them simply as agents In his pecu
liar campaign and had fooled away two
weeks of their time In doing it. Then
they got mad and yesterday appointed a
committee which will call upon his Honor
and inform him of that fact. The com
mittee will not only express its indigna
tion, but will offer Mr. Phelan transcripts
of the testimony of his chosen witnesses
upon whom he relied to make good his
charges. That will be the end of the jury's
business with his Honor's charges. No
further investigation will be made.
When the gamblers of the Palace Ho
tel found themselves without a scene for
their operations they looked around for a
new field or a new subterfuge for playing
again in the local field. Joe Harvey was,
the master spirit of the combination. He
had behind him the moral and, if neces
sary, a more substantial support from
Charley Fair. He enjoyed the friendship
of Chief of Police Lees. He was favored
with the patronage of local gamblers and
was assured of the trade of horsemen,
blacklegs and roustabouts of the race
track. The racing season was approach
ing. If money was to be made it must
be made quickly.
The town was flooded with soldiers com
ing and going. Harvey racked his
brains for an opening. He had with him
Charley Asher, the factotum and sub
servient agent of Moses Gunst, Police
Commissioner. Max Katzenstein, another
of the old Baldwin Hotel contingent, was
ready for any duty, but Harvey could not
see, even under the favored condition of
police connivance, an opportunity to open
a new gambling house.
After a deal of trouble and discussion,
the success of the Chinese offered a sug
gestion. Harvey decided to establish a
social club, and under the shadow of a
law which was Intended as a boon to
worthy institutions prostitute the laws of
the State. The Inspiration was not by any

suggestion and looked for a suitable lo

ago the gambling den was opened. It is
perhaps the worst house of its kind that
was ever opened In San Francisco. Its
cappers are abroad upon the streets in
viting the unwary to visit it. Its agents
are in the tiubs, on the streets and in
saloons advancing its interests. Its games
of faro, poker, roulette, wheel of fortune
and craps are conducted without inter
ruption. It exists as a menace not only
to people of the city, but to visitors and
strangers who. have the right to expect
police protection.
Harvey was altogether too clever to per
mit his own name to be known in the
combination. Alter consultation with his
friends, among whom was Chief of Police
Lees, Harvey secured a lease of the
premises at 143 Mason street. The con
ference with Lees took place at Farley's
saloon and Harvey was assured that the
police are powerless to act. The gambler
then lost no time in perfecting his plans.
The Mason street house was renovated
from top to bottom. It was superbly
furnished with every possible incident to
luxurious surroundings. Word went forth
that It was to be the most exclusive
gambling house ever established on the
coast and particular stress was laid upon
the fact that the police, with convenient
ignorance, would not know that It was
in existence.
On October IS a strange document was
filed with the County Clerk. It purported
to be the articles of incorporation of the
California Club. The California Club, so
the articles read, was organized for purely
social purposes, for the entertainment of
Its members and for the promotion of
their social intercourse. The document
read, with delightful untruth, that an
election had been held and the following
had been elected directors for a period of
one year: A. P. Culver, W. H. Roach,
Ray Mead, W. S. Ferguson and J. F.
Powers. The writer of the document must
have been seized with an after thought
for he scratched out the name of Roach
and substituted H. W. Orear.
These directors are not particularly well
known. Orear has the honor of being the
dispenser of cigars at the Union ferry
depot and J. F. Powers is his clerk. Raj-
Mead, as far as the directory gives in
formation, may be a vaquero, and he may
not be. The other directors have r.ot
had the consideration to give the directory
freight they now land in this city. Al
though it is known that some of the large
force of clerks and other employes now
employed in this city by Goodall, Perkins
& Co. will be taken to Seattle, a greater
number of them, it is understood, will be
thrown out of their positions on the first
of the year.

and Disappeared at 10:30
O'Clock at Night.
Mrs. J. A. Crounse of 12 Oak street re
ported to the Coroner yesterday that Mrs.

that Mrs. Gleason had a quarrel with her

parted from her at half-past 10 o'clock in
Scottish Hall on Larkin strefet. That was
the last time that she was seen by any of
her relatives.

John A. Russell Improving.
John A. Russell, the clerk of the Board
of Supervisors, who suffered a stroke of
paralysis last Wednesday afternoon, is
rapidly approaching recovery in his
apartments at the Lick House. Mr. Rus
sell Is still a very sick man and needs
careful nursing and constant attention,
but his condition has so materially Im
proved that those in attendance feel con
fident that he will pull through all right,
notwithstanding his advanced age.
This news will be a source of great sat
isfaction to the many warm friends Mr.
Russell has, not only in this city but
throughout the enure coast.

people nny information in reference to
themselves.
This gambling club has been organized
to run for thirty years. A copy
of its articles of incorporation
has been filed with the Sec
retary of State. The rooms of the club
are open for business. Its patrons are
already numerous. Its walls echo to
the clink of coin and the sound of many
excited voices. It permits no one not a
member within its doors, but everybody
is welcome as a member. One need but
ring the doorbell, hand $5 to the negro
attendant rind receive the mock ceremony
of initiation. In consideration for this
$5 in gambling checks are given by the
club.
Plainly speaking, the club is an outrage
upon the city. It is a menace to young
men and strangers, but it is unknown to
the police aftrr the conference in Farley's
saloon. Tf the police, however, are un
able to locate 143 Mason street, and are
powerless to place an officer at the faro
table. The Call will show them the house
and instruct them how to get in.
MARKET STREET
MUST BE SANDED
TO SAVE HORSES
Wet Pavements Traps
for Drivers.
It is not uncommon in the early morning
to see half a dozen horsiis lying on the
pavement helpless in the space of two
blocks on Market street. A slight mois
ture or a fog makes the pavement almost
as slippery as glass to the feet of horses
not shod with rubber. Hundreds of driv
ers avoid the bituminized pavement, be
ing actuated by fear for their horses. So
many accidents take place that the need
of some public action is evident. The Call
this morning offers the suggestion that
Market street should be sprinkled with
-sand whenever it is necessary to make
the pavement safer to drive on. Yester
day many persons who have a wide
knowledge of horses and are largely con
cerned in the use of them were inter
viewed concerning the necessity of using
sand freely. One and all declared that the
remedy needed to improve the lot of
drivers had been discovered by The Call.
Secretary Charles Holbrook of the So
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals was enthusiastic for the use of
sand. He had seen six horses lying upon
the pavement in one Market street block.
The only way that the animals could rise
was by having a blanket thrown down to
give them a chance to get a footing. They
would try repeatedly to get upon their
feet unavailingly. Much time would be
lost, much unnecessary suffering inflicted
upon the horses by the repeated falls fol
lowing their struggles to get up. It had
been necessary to kill some horses because
of such accidents on Market street.
No less emphatic in indorsement of lac
plan was "W. H. Fuller of the Overland
Freight and Transfer Company. "Sand
would save the lives of many horses,"
said Mr. Fuller. "Every morning, he
teen Third street and the Palace Hotel,
I see three or four horses lying down on
the pavement. All sorts of business men
are seriously inconvenienced. You see,
when the pavements are wet there is
nothing for the horses' feet to take hnM
upon. I am heartily in favor of vie plan
suggested by The Call and it will be very
popular with all owners of horses in the
city."
John Peterson, foreman for McNab &
Smith, draymen, said: "Sanding MarKet
street when it is wet is just what ought
to be done. There is plenty of sand at
the beach and it ought not to cost much
for carting in. I know all about the
danger and inconvenience of the pave
ment -\\nen It is damp. I live out on
Octavia street and comÂ© down Golden
Gate avenue and Market street early every
morning. Some days I have to get off
the street to be safe. We lost one horse
that fell when the pavement was slip
pery."
Thomas F. Noonan is the president of
the Draymen and Teamsters' Union,
which has a membership of 175 and em
braces very large concerns. "We all con
sider Market street very dangerous,"
said Mr. Noonan, "when it is wet and
when it Is only a little damp. One valu
able horse, to my knowledge, injured by
slipping on Market street, had to be shot.
The Call has struck a good idea in sand-
J.'w. Murphy, proprietor of St. George's
stables, on Bush street, said: "Sand is the
only possible remedy for the slippery
footing on the Market street pavement
when it is wet." -
J H. Leary of the Olympic Club sta
bles, 503 Sutter, said: "Sanding would be
a very good thing, for it would let the
horses' get a foothold. By all means let
us have the pavement sanded when it is
most needed."
W. Garhart, foreman of the St. Law
rence stables, said: "The idea is a first
class one. The horses can't stand with
out having something done. Sanding is
the proper act. One of the valuable
horses stabled here fell and was injured.
I saw four horses down on one block this
Alex McCord of the Fashion stables
said: "I saw four or five horses down on
the pavement on one block to-day. I
heartily indorse the idea of The Call
about the use of sand. It will do the
business." . Â
Sand is employed successfully to make
pavements safer in London. There is no
reason why it should not do well here.
