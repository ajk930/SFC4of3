GATACRE BEATEN AND
FORCED TO RETREAT
British Led Into Ambush and Suffer a
Decisive Reverse.
Turned Back by a Withering Fire, the Column Is
Raked by Shot and Shell as It Retires
Toward Molteno.
MQLTENO. Cape Colony. Dec. 10.â Genera! Gatacre left Puttecolumn. It is believed here that
he proceeded by forced march twelve miies toward Stcrmberg. He had 4000 men, includ
ing the Northumberland Fusiliers, the Rcyal Irish Rifles and two batteries of field artillery.
The British were unmolested by the Boers until the Boer position was reached, when a hot fire
was unexpectedly opened upon the advancing column. The engagement began at 4:15 a. m. At 7
a. m.. after a sharp artillery duel, the British retired. They are now marching toward Molteno.
General Gatacre found the enemy's position impregnable. It was impossible for the British infan
try to get at the Boers.
The British column had arrived safely within a couple of miles of its destination, the only
incidents of the march being an occasional sudden caii of "halt!" under the belief that the Boers
were near. Suddenly a terrific fire opened simultaneously on the British front and right flank,
he Royal Irish Rifles, which formed the advance, sought shelter behind a neighboring kopje and
were speedily joined by the remainder of the column. It was soon found, however, that this po
sition also was covered by Boer guns, which were more powerful than had been supposed. The
troops, therefore, sought a safer place about half a mile away, two batteries in the meantime
engaging the Boers and covering the troops in their withdrawal.
The action now became general at long range, and a detachment of mounted infantry
ioved northward with a view of getting on the enemy's right flank. Suddenly a strong com
mando was seen moving from the north and the Royal Irish Rifles and the Northumberland Reg
iment was sent out to meet it.
It was soon discovered, however, that the Boers had machine guns well placed and the Brit
sn were compelled to face a terrible fire. Finding it impossible to hold the position in the face of
i enemy apparently superior in position, numbers and art-llery, the British retired on Molteno,
Beers following up the retirement closely and bringing two big guns to bear on the retiring
column. It s beneved here that thhe British casualties were not serious.
LONDON. Dec. IT.â The Times publishes the foliowina dispatch from Molteno: "Genera!
oatacre attempted to assault the Boer oosition at Stormberg at dawn to-day (Sunday). The
gu-des led us wrong and we were surprised while in fours and after a very trying night march.
Our retirement was effected in excellent order, there being no hurry even at the most critical
. The Northumberland and Irish Rifles behaved as if on review day. I fear our losses are
heavy. One of our guns we had to abandon."
CAPE TOWN. Dec. 9.â lt is rumored here that the Boers attacked Kimberley at close
quarters last night, but were repulsed with heavy losses.

was for their combined forces to relieve

The Pretoria reports of renewed fighting

that the British, with a team of thirty
two oxen hauled a naval gun to the top of
a high ridge north of Modder River,
whence they fired lyddite shells
on the Boer position at a range of 6500
yards, where the enemy was apparently
constructing an emplacement for â  forty
pounder. The lyddite shells appeared to
do Immense damage. The Boers retired,
but the Incident Is Interesting as showing
that the Boers are still In position quite
close to Modd'-r River.
The engineers report that It would take

Lord Methuen is still compelled to ride

FEARS FOR THE SAFETY
OF GATACRE'S FORCE
LONDON. Dec. 11.â Upon the heels of
yesterday's newÂ« of the gallant sortie
from Ladysmlth this morning comes In
telligence of the practical defeat of Gen
eral Sir W. F. Gatacre In his first en
gagement with the Boers. While this lat
ter reverse, though serious enough, is re
garded as only an elementary check, still
Its effect upon the morale of the Boers
and the minds of wavering Dutch farm
ers In Cape Colony will undoubtedly ren
der the task of the British much more
difficult and drawn out.
General Gatacre, moving out Saturday
with 3000 men and two batteries of artil
lery from Putter's Kraal in the hÂ«pe of
surprising the Boers at Stormberg, wÂ»d
misled by his guide and found himself in
an untenable position, with the result
that he was obliged to retire with se
vere losses upon Moltena. He reports
over 630 officers and men missing i:: addi
tion to a small list of killed and wounded.
Reinforcements will doubtless b<Â» s^-nt
up with all wgmtA to make General Gat
acre.s p. sition <Â»-.-ure. but the fact that
he has gravely underestimated the
strength of the Boers opposed to him Is
responsible for a feeling of considerable
uneasiness aa to the immediate future of
the campaign In that section of the coun
try.
News from I.adysmith created great en
thusiasm. General White evidently has
not forgotten the art of delivering a
smashing blow at the enemy, nor have
his troops lost their wontÂ«ni dash through
the haruameiits of a prolonged siege.
General Hunter, who was one of the Sir
dar's right-hand men in the Soudan,
proved the right man to lead the sortie.
The destruction of two big guns and the ;
capture of a Maxim was the severest
blow the Boers have received in the ope
rations at Ladysmith.
From the fact that the correspondent's
telegram reached Frere on Saturday night
describing the fighting on Friday, it is in
ferred that the investment of Ladysmlth
is not so strict as it was.
fiffnic was he*rd yesterday'" morning,
hut it was pi-ohably only a continuation
of the futile bombardment. News of the
beginning of a general advance from
Frere Is momentarily expected. The tres
tle bridge over the river has been fin-
ishfd and the only anxiety of the troops
is to hear the word of command to go
'1 t^ hard, stubborn fighting, which
there Is very likely to be.

This magnificent piece of work hn:- <-vi

their guns on Mount Bulwan huve prac

of the attack cannot fail to have un im

At daybreak a sjnart skirmish took

the Boers thought that all our troops
were engaged at Lombards Kop. They
therefore tried to get near the town, but
the movement was checked in capital

WHITE THANKS HIS MEN
FOR BRILLIANT WORK
LONDON. Dec. ILâ A special dispatch
they require for the treatment of gold
deposits. Tho "total amount of silver bul
lion refined In the United States last year
was in round numbers 91.0UU.000 ounces.
The superintendent of the New York
assay office, the report says, has called
attention to the fact that, although
about $30,000,000 In United Statw? coin was
exported last year, no bars were taken
for export, and suggests that the "export
charge" of one-tenth of 1 per cent, which
Is exacted.'. ls operating to our disadvan
tage. There is no object, says Director
Roberts, in forcing the public to take our
coin out of the country- by making It
more expensive to take bars. We had
better furnish the raw material than the
manufactured article. These bars have
to be shipped from New York to Phila
delphia and worked into coin at some
waste and considerable expense to replace
the coin exported, while the bars would
have served every purpose for export.
The export charge was nut on bars sev
eral years age, when gold exports were
heavy, and some means to discourage
them was sought. When the current coin
is abraded exporters will pay a slight pre
mium to get bars, which are full weight,
but our current gold Is now largely new
and on the average close to standard and
exporters are preferring to shin it rather
than to pay the bar charge. The follow
ing data Is given:
Th* total gold import* of the year amounted
to 5&5.978.W2. and exports to Â»:<7.r.:.'\773. The to
tal Silver imports were $31,110,578. commercial
value, and sliver exports $56,651,335. The stock
of bullion in the mints and assay offices on
July 1. IMB, was as follows:
Gold. J119.55J.77J: silver (cost). $55,575,898. ;
During the year 11.1W.W1 In worn and tin
current gold coins were received, with a loss of
nO.Mt, and $>.r.SS.<i76 of worn and uncurrent
pubsldlary sliver was recolned. with a loss of
J455.7V7. The seignoragc* on the coinage of sli
ver dollars during the year amounted to $0,520,
145: on subsidiary silver. fSG,S3S; on nickels and
pennies, M9C.18 The coinage of all nations.
Including recoinagea. in IS9S was:
Gold. CTT.MS: silver. J149.252.935.
The Government haÂ« now. practically no bul
lion available for the coinage of subsidiary cur
rency. It has bullion purchased for the coinage
of silver dollars, but this cannot bo used with
out authority from Congress. The needs of the
country for fractional currency are increasing,
and legislative authority for new coinage la
imperatively demanded.

position Btill strongly held. The Eight

four killed and seventeen wounded.
"The Boers fired incessantly as the
British slowly retired. At a special pa

General Hunter and all engaged, espe

work."
METHUEN RECEIVING

than haÂ« bean an Increase In the general
amount of gold In the country."
The reduction shown in the stock of tliÂ» Im
perial Bank has been brought about by the
monetary reform. The enormous stock- In the
bank at the close of 1897 vai provided for
the purpose of bringing the paper currency of
the country to par with gold and establishing
Its tnterchangahllity. During the past year
the bank baa been paying out gold freely and
gold coin, lure absent from the circulation of
the empire, has a Rain entered Into Common use.
The Bank of England and Imperial Bank of
Germany both show a loss of gold during the
year, but the record of the exports and im
ports of Great Britain and Herman show that
each of these countries received about $50,000.
000 more gold than It parted with. Trade was
very active In both countries and apparently
drew on the reserve, stocks of the two leading
banking institutions. The money stock of
those countries was. In a larger degree than
the year previous. In movement among people
and In the local banks. It Is of special Inter
est that thÂ«? mock of uncovered bank notes
In Germany was 124,000.000 greater on Decem
ber 31 ISSS. than on December 31, 1897. and was
$36,000,000 greater in France. That Illustrates
the elasticity which enables the monetary sys
tem* of those countries to *a*e off such an
extraordinary demand for goli as the united
States made on the world last yar. The Aus
tro Hungarian Bank had $17.000.00\> more of un
covered paper out at the end of the year than
at the beginning. The three countries had out
about $78,000,000 more of uncovered bank notes
than the year before, a fact which doubtless
contributes much to ease the financial situa
tion. The ability to thus enlarge the stock of
paper currency Is valuable to a country In the
event of any sudden call upon It for heavy pay
ments In gold. The issue acts as a buffer be
tween such demand and the commercial Inter
ests of the country, protecting the. latter from
sudden and sharp pressure. It is a legitimate
u>-r of credit by the country, through the agency
of banks of issue, to meet a passing demand.
The most notable change In gold stocks during
Urn year was In the United States. The stock
Of coin In the country. Including bullion in the
mints on January 1. IS>9B. was estimated at
$7U.245.!C3. and on January L ISM. at $?45..98.

The production of gold In all of the Important
gold fields of the world Is Increasing rapidly,
and with prospects of continued gains for years
to come. The yield in the world In the calendar
year 1838 wan $357,000.0C0. against $338,000,000 In
1697. The production In Australia to date In
1899 has shown a gain of 25 per cent over the
corresponding months of 188S, which Indicates
a probable gain fur the full year of $16,000,000.
The United States. Canada and Mexico will
doubtless Increase their production $18,000,000.
In South Africa the production In the first half
of the year was 35 per cent above the yield of
the same months In IS9*. and If the Industry had
been undisturbed the gain for the year would
probably hn\-*> been above $20, 0^0.000. A* all these
principal districts are now In condition to pro
duce, at a higher rate than at the opening of
the present year, and all are preparing for
larger yields, It Is not Improbable that when
operations â¢ are fully resumed In South Africa,
the world's output will quickly pass $400,000,000
per annum. The world's stock of coin Is now
Wing Increased more rapidly and by a higher
annual percentage to the existing stock than i
during the period from ISSO to 1860. when the I
great output of gold from California and Aus
tralia, startled the economists of all countries
and gave the world a depreciating standard of
value. The effect of this new flood of standard
money upon the markets, the Industries, tht
earnings of those who work for wages, and all
of the various relations of the people : In our
present highly organized society, will be a
most Interesting study. It will Inevitably be a. A
potent factor In affairs. J
CAUSTIC COMMENT
ON CUPID'S WILES
F^ev. Father Phillips Strides a
Blow at the San Rafael
Marriage Bureau.
SAN RAFAEL. Dec. 10.â Rev. Father Phillips, pastor of St. Raphael's <
Catholic Church, has net his priestly foot on the practice of Catholics
marrying outside their own parishes. Incidentally the priest has registered
an emphatic protest against secret marriages generally, these two topics
forming the burden of separate sermons to-day, which have excitod lively in
terest even in San Rafael, and will doubtless create a flurry in San Francisco j
and Oakland.
For several years this city has been the Mecca of persons rtesirlous of I
having tho nuptial knot tied with as much secrecy as possible, and the fact j
that the newspapers have never failed to print all about such unions when i
the contracting parties were of any prominence in the social or business world
does not seem to have interfered in the slightest with the county exchequer
as tallied by County Clerk Graham. Not a few of these people have been
married by Rev. Father Phillips during his pastorate, while Rev. Father i
Lagan used to deem It a dull day when he failed to officiate at a marriage I
or two. But this beatific state of things has received a rude shock by the !
decidedly antagonistic attitude of Father Phillips, and hereafter when the
priest officiates at the nuptials of other than his own parishioners the path- â 
way to hia action will have been plentifully decorated with red tape.
"I desire to give notics that I will marry no more couples from outside '
parishes." said the priest, "unless they present dispensations granted by the ;
Archbishop. Heretofore I have received dispensations by telephone or tele- '<
graph, but I do not think that the proper method of conducting such affairs.
Moreover. I must have three days' notice in all cases.
"People often leave their own parishes to get married and come to San
Rafael because they harbor petty spite against the priest of their own
parish, or because they want to keep the marriage a secret. The marital
bond establishes a holy relation anu\ln my opinion, secrecy can bÂ« desired
for no good reason.
"There is nothing in It for the priest, anyway, because all fees have to be
returned to the parish from which the contracting parties come, and offlclat- i
Ing at such marriages at a moment's notice frequently becomes' a nulÃance." !

Finance Committee to
Be Reorganized.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 10.â The week
does not promise to be a busy one In the
Senate, the Indications being for routine
business and short sessions Inside the
chamber with much preparation for fu
ture work in the committee-rooms. Sena
tor Mason will open the week with a
speech on his resolution declaring the
sympathy of this country' with the Boers
In their war with Great Britain. There
may "be other brief speeches upon this
and other questions, though there is a
general disposition on the part of the
Senators to postpone speechmaklng until
after the holidays.
The Republican Senators generally fe.-l
that the most Important work for thÂ«
present is to secure the reorganisation of
the committees, especially the Finance
Committee, as preliminary to other work.
An effort will be made to complete the
reorganization during the present week.
The Finance Committee may meet on
Tuesday for preliminary consideration of
the finance bill, but this is not yet decided
upon. The expectation now is that this
bill will not be taken up in the Senate un
til after the Christmas holidays.
The Committee on Foreign Relations
will take up the reciprocity treaties on
Wednesday. The Committee on Privi
leges and felections will consider the testa
over Senatorial F^ats In a desultory way,
but the real work on these will not begin
until Saturday. when opposing counsel will
be heard In the Quay case.

NEW YORK. Dec. 10.-A dispatch

firmation of the story that Rosser
Is the name man who killed Henry

haps fatally wounded Fred Slater In Mad
â¢ lson Square Garden Just at thÂ«Â» conclusion
of the Fix-day bicycle ra<e Saturday
night, was arraigned before Magistrate
Maya in Jefferson Market Police Court
this morning. I>r. Wynkoop of ltellevue

condition, though comparatively frt*e from

Although he tried to keep his pa*t in
thÂ© background and even assured his
counsel. Mark Alter, th.it he had never
before been In trouble, it Is known that
Rosscr already has one life charged to
his account. While a member of the Tir^t

Rower's behavior at the time was Â«imi

deep feeling of disgrace and of his flnÂ«Â»
:._-:;!!> connection. Just a year ago iie
threatened to commit suicide., but only
succeeded in convincing the police of Ills'

Seidom has a tragedy In real life been
enacted with more sensational surrour.d

were strangers to each other and. by the

NEW YORK. Dec 10â "v^orld to

Senator William P. Frye, president pro

ply to the question why it was neces

Commerce, they were of the utmost Impor

thought by those who hei-<i It to bo a
part of the programme. Friends of the
Injured man. who sat within twenty feet
of him when ho was wounded, knew noth
ing of the affair until they read It in to
day's papers.
"I never saw Rosser until I met him
In the garden on Saturday night." Said
Slater. "We made a small bet if $5 At
the tlnish we were all standing up and
yelling at the riders. Just then 1 heard
an usher shout: 'Lookout; he's .â¢ ing for
you with a revolver.'
"1 turned and was surprised to see Ros
sor right next to me with his revolver lev
led at my breast. Instinctively 1 grappled
with him mid tried t.Â» wrench" the weapon
fr.m Ms hand. Uefore 1 had hardly lime

bÂ»- absolutely mad with passion because
of the lo*s of his bet. H. face was pur
ple and his eyes were ablaze. I bore him
no malice, had not quarreled wit him nor
annoyed him In any way. Why ue wanted
to kill me I don't know, but he did want
to and said so even after It waa all over.
When he was under arrest he taunted me
and said: "I am a doctor and I can tell
you that you look like a dead one.' "
After his arrest Rosser broke down and
sobbed, but it seemed to be from excite
ment rather than 'â  row. He said that
his disgrace would kill his parents and
that he would not live to face them. He

tunity. He was taken to the West Thir

CMef Devery everything which he could
possibly use to assist in self-murder was
taken trom him. â¢ â¢
After being locked in his cell a guard
was placed outside to see that he did him
self no harm. Rosser. however, evidently
changeo his mind about suicide.
The physicians have succeeded in keep-
Ing down Slater's fever, aud unless septi
caemia sits In he will have about an even
chance with death. To-night his condi
tion 1 ecame more alarming, but the case
was not considered hopeless. One of tho
saddest features of the shooting of Slater
is that he was toon to marry a charming
young woman of Wcstfield, N. J. She is
now prostrated with grief.
Chief Devery had a talk with Rosier to
day, ar.d from him received a full and
frto crnfo-s.-ion. Later in the day the
Chief .said:
"Rower Is a remarkable man. I don't

ST. PAUL. Dec. 10.â Rev. Dr. 8. G.
Smith, pastor of the People's Church In
this city, whose recent statements In re
gard to women wage earners and their
Interference with men workers, have at
tracted wide attention and criticism, to
night replied to his critics in a sermon.
Dr. Smith said In part:
"It was In savage times that woman
was the slave and served her master in
mcnl.il tasks. We are fast on the road
to a new savagery- The problem be
gan when the discovery of machinery and
the factory system took the place of the
man and tool. Greedy employers bade
the delicate lingers or woman and the
dimpled hand of childhood to grasp the
fallen task.
"Economic conditions have no chivalry
arid human avarice has no sense of honor.
Th^ majority of worklngwomen in this
country, now 4,000,0u.-, of them, are be
tween the apes of 14 and 25. The great
fact of the last decade, however, is the
enormous Increase among the number of
girls under 16 years of age.
"We are devouring the possible
strength of the nation by draining the
life of Its future mothers. Forty-five per
cent of the manufacturing in the United
States Is now done by women.
"Make our women beasts of burden and
the doom of our strength is at hand. No
army is any more vigorous than themo:ti
ers who bore them. The enormous In
crease of woman labor and of Immature
young â¢ women Is the economic, social,
moral and physical evil of our time, and
is the most serious menace to the na
tion's life."

GOVERNMENT MAY BUY
WEST INDIAN ISLANDS
Denmark Anxious to Dispose of a
Group and President May Recom
mend Their Purchase.
. WASHINGTON. Dec, 10.â unofficial
proposition has been made to this Gov
ernment for the sale to It of Islands In
the West Indies owned by the Danish
Government. The price asked is $3,000,000,
and the administration now has under
consideration the advisability of recom
mending an appropriation for effecting
their purchase. Before taking any definite
steps In the matter there Is reason to be
lieve that the President will confer with
the members of the Foreign Relations
Committee of the Senate, and should they
approve of the plan ho will probably
direct that the purchase be made.
The proposition submitted to the Secre
tary of State has not come direct from the
Danish Government. A corporation has
secured an option on th.> Islands, and its
representative haÂ« indicated to "he de
partment that it is willing to dispose of
the tvrriury for the price stÃtÂ«?<l above.
These islands were the subject of discus
sion in the Benata Just before the war
with Spain, when S*Â».;ator Lodiro of. Mas
sachusetts introduce-! .â  resolution for the '
purchase of the lsÂ»'"inÂ«ls. The prioo then
suggested was $3,QOO.XKW. Tin* noject of
acquiring the Islands at that time was
In i rdÂ«-r to provide this Government with
coaling stations for war purposes as well
as to prevent their sale to any I^'iropean
eminent. No action, however, was
:; ' * 11.
Denmark is still anxious to dispose of
the Islands, but realizes that this Gov
ernment would consider their transfer to
any European nation as an unfriendly act
and in violation of the Monroe doctrine,
and therefore prefers to sell them to the
United States.

INTERESTING VERSION
OF THE IRENE INCIDENT
MANILA. Dec. 10.. 4:30 p. m.- -Colonel
Julio del Rio, who Is among the releis.d
Spaniards that have just arrived here,
gives an interesting version of the famous
Ir.ne Incident In Sublg Hay in July of
la*t year Be was formerly In command
of the Spanish troops In the Olingano
district. His narrative Is corroborated
by Sennr Rafael Rosello. a wealthy Span
ish merchant who also fell Into the hand:*
of the insurgents.
Both declare that the Spanish surren
dered to Captain Coghlaa of the rnited
States cruiser JTsjUiisj.il on an ex-
SgraillllSlll that they w m not to be
given tip i(, the Filipino?, and they as
sert that the Spfinish Qovernmrtit pro.a
lsed to Press their claims against the
United States for their long imprison
ment. Â»
According to their story, a thousand
Insurgents were besieging Olinsapo. where
there were two companies of marines and
a battalion of artillery, together with
m:tny civilians. The " Gorman cruis-r
Irene entered the harbor to take ihe
women and children on board At this
Juncture the insurgent steamer Fiiiptnas

i The Irene threw a shot across her bow,
claiming the right to stop her. M Ger
many had not recognized the Insurgent
flag. Tne Filipinos then raided a wnite
flag and departed. When she i.turn- 1
6he was flying the Insurgent Hag and was
accompanied by the United States war
ships Concord and Raleigh. r lho Irene
was then leaving the harbor with non
combatants.
"Without the least warning." says
Colonel del Kio and Bejnor X Â»ello, "me
American warship* began to bombard us,
Unrig about twenty-flve shots. Seeing that
resistance was useltss, as our gun* had
never been mounted, we raised the white
flag. Captain Cogbian came ashore with
several i Ulcers and It was expressly
stipulated that the surrender was to the
Americans alone. Captain Coghlan waa
asked to promise that the .Spaniards
should not be delivered to the Insurgents,
and when he had given his pledge the en
tire garrison surrendered.
"The Americans galled away on the
evening or the 7th, leaving the garrison
practically unarmed. They returned on
the Bth. Meanwhile the insurgents had
repeatedly tired upon the town. Captain
Coghlan now ordered the Spaniards to
embark on the Filipinos. When they
protested he said that, although In the
hands of the insurgents, they would be
treated as American prisoners.
"Nine civilians, all merchants, were
placed on board the Flliplnas, and. despite
their protests, were kept Imprisoned on
the vessel at Ollngapo until their recent
release."
Benor Rosello, who Is chiefly r^spon
slble for the foregoing statement, admits
that, except for one attempt to rob the
merchants, for which ARUInaJdo punished
the ofllcera of the Filipinos by reducing
them, all were well treated.
Colonel del Rio, In a subsequent state
ment, said:
"Captain Coghlan gave his word that
our capitulation, would be accepted as It
was made, that Is, to the Americans. He
promised that we should not be given Into
the hands of the lmmrgents, and I believe
he was sincere.
"Loiter the Concord went to Cavlte for
Instructions, returning with an order from
Admiral Dewey that we were to be hand
ed over to the Insurgents."
Colonel del hi.i and amor Rosello de
clare that the Irene left her anchorage si
6 o'clock In the morning and the American
warships arrived at 10:30, passing the Ger
man cruiser as she was leaving the bay.
They express surprise at the popular be
lief that the Irene slipped her cable on
the appearance of the Concord and Ral

> throughout tiie entire
1
Xor has any former year ever closed with such
uniform firmness in prices. Quotations for pig iron,
while already high, are fully maintained, though some
descriptions of manufactured iron are lower. Pro
ducers of iron and steel are generally sold well up
into the middle of next year, so no decline in the
iron industry need be expected for some time to
come. The recent famine in cars has not yet been
fully relieved, and the demand for iron for this ac
count continues enormous. Lumber, too, shows con
tinued activity, with no loss in firmness. Colder
weather has stimulated the demand for boots and
shoes, and hides and leather, already "high and firm.
:>rc still stronger in consequence, the former having
zip.iin advanced during the week. Shipments of boots
and shoe* from Boston have been 37.2,000 cases, or
0.3 per cent larger than in 189 S. and 937.000 cases, or
27.8 per cent larger than in 1892. the year preceding
the panic. Wool has again gone up under a strong
speculative demand, though manufacturers are not
buying much row. having filled their most urgent
Heeds. Almost all the large New Kngland cotton
mills have granted their operatives an advance of 10
per cent in wages, which does not look much like
depression in this industry. Another very favorable
feature is the improvement in wheat, which, though
flight, is stimulating, as it has broken the monotonous
decline of the past several months. The commercial
failures, too, which increased a fortnight ago, again
show a decrease, those last seek being 221, against
248 for the same week in 1808. When we look at
these figures, and add advances of 10 per cent in the
wages of cotton operatives in Georgia and mine
workers in West Virginia, it will be seen that 1899 is
making a brillinnt exit.
Wall street is quieter, as ufual at the cloÂ«e of the
year, when the public investors generally withdraw,
waiting for the January disbursements. The con
tinued stringency in money there also operates against
any activity, hut it is hoped that the market will
get easier after the turn of the year. At present
the professional traders have the street to themselves.
Agkin; it is believed in New York that a critical point
in the foreign money market is approaching. Neither
the Bank of France, the Bank of England nor the
8.-uik of Germany has any gold to spare, and the
slow advance and lack of success of the British ar
mies in South Africa make financiers timid about
r.per.Ming. All three hanks have recently advanced
their rates of discount to keep their gold from slip
ping through their fingers, but the doubtful condition
of affairs in the Transvaal is against much improve
ment in the gold supply for some time to come.
In California the prospects continue flattering. We
have had a very fine year in 1899, but unless present
indications are misleading 1900 will be a still bettor
one.

THE PfINhfINDLE EXTENSION.
/ N PPOXENTS of the proposed park improve-
OPPONENTS the proposed park improve
ment? have seemingly abandoned the conten
tion that the cost would be excessive, and of
late have put forward the objection that the construc
tion of the panhandle would require along a consid
erable part of the route a deep cut which would be
injurious to property and entail upon the city a heavy
expenditure for the remuneration of property owners.
It has been argued that unless the deep cut were made
the grade of the roadway would.be so steep as to
render it unfit for driving purposes. The opponents
ot progress have therefore presented what they regard
as a dilemmaâ either a grade too steep or a cost too
1 steep to be undertaken.
The new objection is not any more valid than that
1 which was first put forth. There is nothing in the
condition of the district to be traversed by the pan
handle extension that will require an excessive Â«x
penditure to render it fit for a grand driveway and
promenade from the city to the park.
In a letter discussing the subject Superintendent
McLaren of Golden Gate Park points out that the
deepest cut necessary to give a 6 per cent grade,
which should be the maximum,. will be only twenty
six feet, and that for only three -blocks; that it is not
desirable to give a uniform slope along the whole
distance, as the effect should be undulating; that the
width of the blocks, 275 feet, allows ample oppor
tunity for curving drives; that grades and bridges
: could be so arranged with reference to the present
i grade of cross streets that in driving along the pap
j handle from Van Ness avenue to the park it would
not be across any car lines on the level with the cars;
, and he concludes by saying:
"Once the land is acquired it is a matter for an
I engineer and landscape gardener to devise the best
plan for its improvement. Winding roads may follow
[ the present elevations or the twenty-six-foot cut be
made. In either event the great purposes of the pan
! handle extension will be served. Out of the thirteen
! blocks only three will be affected by the cut suggest
j ed, and that will enhance rather than diminish the
effect."
In presenting their various objections to park ex
tension, the opponents of the improvement are really
aiding the campaign of education on the subject. It
is desirable to have all the problems of the under
taking thoroughly thought out, discussed and under
stood from the start. There is no intention on the
part of the nio^t enterprising citizen "to go it blind,"
in the way of municipal progress. Every phase of \
the issue should be duly considered, and when that
consideration is given fairly, the conclusion will be
more favorable than ever to the projected improve
ments. â¢
The extension of the panhandle is a necessary ad- l
junct to the park. It is the connecting link which is :
to join the two stateliest thoroughfares of the city
with the great park, which is now one of the most
beautiful and extensive in the world. With the newly
awakened spirit of progress and civic patriotism a
provision for the establishment of the boulevard
should be promptly made. Let us vote it this year as ,
a holiday gift to ourselves and to future generations
of San Franciscans for all time to come.

THE KENTUCKY CONTEST.
OF the three members of the Board of Election
Commissioner- m Kentucky, two have reached
the conclusion that the lawful vote of the peo
ple in the recent election for Governor was 193.714
for the Republican candidate, Taylor, and 191,331 for
Goebel. the Democratic candidate; and accordingly
they have issued the official certificate declaring Tay
lor to be Governor-elect. The third member of the
commission refused to sign the certificate and has
filed a minority report.
Thr decision of the Board is not final. There is
still an avenue of appeal if Goebel chooses to make
11, and it is probable he will do so. It appears that
on the very day the Election Commissioners issued
the certificate to Taylor, the Court of Appeals de
two election cases in a way that is regarded as
favorable to the chances of Goebel should there be a
recount. In one of these, the court held that all bal
ibotlld be printed on white paper, sufficiently
that the printing cannot be distinguished from
the bark, and if ballots are used at an election which
do not substantially comply with the law the election
1- not conducted as required by law, and is invalid.
In the other case the decision was a ruling making
perpetu.il the writ of prohibition issued against
Judge Tony of Louisville restraining him from in
terfering with local elections by writs of mandamus.
Ht was charged by the Democrats with arbitrarily
issuing the writs.
With that much in the way of encouragement Goe
bel will doubtless make up his mind to continue the
contest. He is the more likely to do so by reason of
the fiery zeal with which his partisans are urging him
on. Throughout the country' generally political issues
have been so comparatively unimportant this year
that few people realize the bitterness which animated
the fight in Kentucky. An illustration of the spirit
of Ctocbel's followers is to be found in a recent utter
;Â«nce of the Louisville Courier-Journal. It declares
the fight against Goebd was made by a combination
of railways, trusts and other corporations with the
blicans of the Str.tc. and says:
la the day of election approached ominous mut
tering! of daughter were Riven out by the oracles of
ihe railway- Republican trust. Senator Deboe began
it. He was followed by the trust newspapers Rivers
of blond flowed through the columns of these. Citi
zens of the best repute were singled out and men
tidrcd by name for massacre. One newspaper, which
'â we its existence directly and solely to the trust.
advocated the burning of the Courier-Journal build,
ing and the lynching of the responsible owners of
the property. The Saturday night before the election
the orators of the trust made the air livid with their
prr.fanity and lurid with their threats. The Governor
of the State came here and sat upon a platform and
liftcned to talk that would have disgraced a Tagal
Prince Albert frocks and rifle hats, calling
themselves gentlemen but putting all Christian man
hood to shame, went about with their pockets stuffed
with trust money and trust votes to corrupt, while
the drag! of the trust, with Whallen at their hea-l.
were preparing to spring at the opportune moment."
Now. it is safe to say that these assertions contain
exaggeration! carried to the verge of complete false
hood. That they have been set forth by a paper of
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, DECEMBER 11 1809.
the standing of the Courier-Journal is the only thing
which gives them significance, but that is significance
enough. It is a warning of the evil passions whioh
are aroused when such men as Goebel get control of
the political machinery of a great party in a State,
and should set the people everywhere on guard
against bosses of that kind.
POSTMASTER GENERAL'S REPORT.
rROM the summary sent from Washington of
the annual report of the Postmaster General it
appears the public expectation of a recommenda
tion for the establishment of a domestic parcels post
system is to be disappointed. In the summary there
is no reference to the subject, nor to that of postni
savings banks. The recommendations are, in fact,
extremely conservative and hardly go beyond what is
required in the way of extending facilities to meet
the growing demands of the country and for remedy
ing abuses which have developed under the existing
law.
The Postmaster General commends the bill intro
duced by Mr. Loud in the last Congress t<>
put an end to the misuse oi the privilege
of second class mail matter by persons who are not
entitled to it. The public is fairly familiar with the
facts of the case. Congress designed to give to news
papers and other periodicals a rate of postage which
would enable the people to obtain such educational
and news publications at a comparatively small cost.
The publishers of cheap novels and of advertising cir
culars adopted the scheme of issuing their publica
tions as "periodicals" and by that means procured the
ri.L.'ht of mailing them at'secood class matter. The re
stilt has been that the Government has been carry in:;
tons of that kind of stuff at a loss every year, and as
a consequence there has been an annual deficit in the
â¢ ffice Department.
From this condition of affairs the Postmaster Gen
eral makes three deductions. Firstâ That more than
one-fourth of the entire volume and .veight of matter
carried through the mails is rated and pays as second
class matter, when, under the spirit and intent of the
law. it ought to be rated and to pay as third class
matter. Second â That while this wrongly classe 1
matter amounts to more than one-quarter of the
whole volume of mail transmitted, it furnishes only
one-fifty-fifth part of the postal revenue. Thirdâ
That the expense of transportation being reckoned at
8 cents a pound, the mere carrying of this matter costs
$14,108,129 04. while the revenue from it was only
$1,763,516 13. involving a loss to the Government of
$i2,.U4.6i2 01.
These abuses have been repeatedly pointed out, and
they would have been put an end to lotifr ago but for
the existence of a strong lobby interested in main
taining them, and for the widespread opinion that the
deficit in the Postoffice Department is due less to the
carrying r.i second class mail at a lose than to the
cm essive prices which are paid to railroads for car
rying all clashes of mail. In the last Congress many
Representatives voted against the Loud bill on the
express ground that they believed postal economy
should begin by reducing the rates paid to the rail
roads and not by depriving publishing homes and
advertisers of the second class mail privileges.
It is gratifying to note that the Postmaster General
urges upon the attention of Congress the need of an
immediate reorganization and reclassification of the
railway mail service. The two things, in fact, shoulj
he undertaken together. In the last Congress the
effort to put an end to second class mail abuses syaj
defeated by men ;vho said the railway abuses should
be remedied first, rind then when a bill to remedy
that evil was introduced it was defeated by members
who said the second class mail abuses ought to have
been first remedied. It is not worth while having
that farce repeated again. There is no use dealing
with the evil by piecemeal. Let the whole postal law
be reconsidered and all the abuses and defects be
abolished at one reform.
WHEN Edward Atkinson, by way of arousing
popular sentiment against the conquest of the
Philippines, began to circulate through the
mails copies of certain speeches made in Congress
against annexation he was roundly denounced as a
traitor, his pamphlets were excluded from the Phil
ippine mails and some of the more exuberant jingo
journals demanded that he be arrested by the mili
tary arm of the Government or lynched by the
people.
The British jingoes appear to be less rabid than
our own by a great degree, and their postoffice
authorities arc negligent of the duty of suppressing
treasonable documents. There exists in Manchester an
j organization calling itself frankly the "Manchester
, Transvaal Committee." which is engaged in circula
ting far and wide documents of various kinds calcu
lated to give aid and comfort to the enemy. The
issues which led up to the war are dealt with vigor
oasly, and the British Government is assailed with
something of the ardor which marks the conduct in
country of a Presidential campaign.
In one of these pamphlets, recently received, the
j Boers are described as "a people passionately seek
ing freedom from British control, cheated out of ter-
I ritory by British arbitration, once already robbed of
; independence by British force, and the recent victims
; of a foul plot hatched by the man whom the British
Ministersâ and. so far as they know, the British na-
I tionâ love to honor." The Outlanders in the same
pamphlet are depicted as "a medley of gold-seekers,"
who have swept upon the Transvaal "in sudden tor
rents, crowding into a single district and a single in
! dustry, seeking not a permanent home, but a preda
lory sojourn in a foreign land."
Commenting upon the assertion that the Outland
ers have been nnjmtly taxed, the Manchester com-
I mince says: "Thf gold law of the Transvaal is the
most liberal in the world, and. as might be expected.
I the progress of output and of profits has been phe
; r.omenally large. Compare with the Rand the condi
tions imposed 'by the speculators who own and rule
Mashonaland; there it is ordained that 50 per cent of
all gold mining profits goes to the Government and
that all diamonds are a Government monopoly."
Carefully and elaborately the arguments of the
committee go over every claim made by the British
Government and by the Otttlanden and show the
weakness or injustice of each. Coming at last to the
! question of the right of Great Britain to interfere in
the internal affairs of the Transvaal the committee
says! "A war in order to compel another state to
give to British aliens a share of the government is
lan act without precedent in the annals of public
: crime.*' nnd the pamphlet closes by saying: "To in
sist that we have su7erainty implicitly contained in n
j convention from which it is explicitly excluded, to
, read into that suzerainty an utterly unprecedented
power to interfere in the internal government whose
independence xc had expressly guaranteed, and to
refuse arbitral investigation of these claims, constitute
an aggravated insolence of demeanor which, if per
; sistcd in. can hardly fail to bring its own punishment
if the government of this world rests upon any foun
1 dations of morality."

HOW MINES FLOURISH.
One or the biggest possibilities to bo

California petroleum industry Is Just now

for the future of the Industry. But Mr
Cooper thinks that he has solved a chem
ical, laboratory and Industrial problem
the solution of which would mean more
than the discovery of several oil fields
of the magnitude of the Los Angeles
field.
As is well known, the California min
eral oils have been good for little else
than fuel. As fuel California petroleum
In supplying better than anything else the
crying need of the State for a cheaper
source of power. California oils so far
produced in commercial quantities have
Jin asphalt base, while the Eastern and
Russian oils, which practically supply the
oil lamps of the world, have a parafllne <
base. Mineral oils always vary in vari
ous ways according to the districts from
which they come, am! California oils are
peculiar and are differentiated even In
this State.
The mineral oils which flow or are '
pumped from the ground all over the
world have varying chemical character-
iptlcÃ and are complex In composition.
From the "crude nil" which comes* from
the earth com** â erica of products, as dls
tillntlon Is carried on at varying tempera
tures and by varied processes. From all
such nils naphthas, benzines, etc., are
first recovered by distillation. These are
the most volatile elements. They are
produced In California oil refineries.
OH flt for Illuminating uses Is a sort
of midway product. How much Illumin
ating oil can "be distilled from a certain
crude oil depends, of course, on the
chemical composition of the crude oil.
After the illuminating oil has been dis
tilled at the requisite, temperature there
remain various kinds and grades of oil
useful for lubricants. In recent years
mineral oils have largely superseded ani
mal and vegetable oils for this purpose
But i small part of the California oil
product is refined. The Kreat bulk of
thÂ«Â» product Is burned up under steam
boilers, and the demand for this purpose
exceeds the supply, as It is cheaper than

lubricating oils, vaseline, paralllnc, as
phalt, naphtha, gasoline, etc.
This is one of the preat Industrial se
crets of the State. California oil was not
put In the ground by the Almighty to b'i
burned In ordinary "coal-oil" lamps as
the refineries of ISM are able to monkey
with it Nobody can burn distilled Cali
fornia oil in a lamp without i.. ins driven
out of the house by the odor and having
a lamp chimney to clean In a short time.
It smokes and smells. Up to date it is
better used in h furnace.
Hut some people do not think so and
this will be news to many Californians.
The Standard Oil Company controls the
Illuminating oil market out here as else
where. There Is no war between it and
the Union or any other California oil com
pany. The average householder knows
that the corner grocery soils oil at vari
ous prices. Good oil that neither smokes
nor stinks costs so much. Cheaper oil
smokes and stinks In either â  lamp or a
coal oil stove. That cheap oil Is a mix
ture of California and tern oil. Hun
dreds of thousands of barrels of this mlx
ture are sold on this coast yearly. Men
who know the business say that Califor
nia burns on an nverapo a lower grade of
illuminating oil than any part of the dv
ilized world. The best Eastern oil is in
the market, but the cheaper oils described
are largely supplied and bought.
The reason why California petroleum
does not afford a K'-^'i Illuminating Â«>n \\,-.a
In its chemical composition. Petroleum,
which scientifically includes natural put,
mineral oils and .-..!' i] iis^'mlt, parafllna,
etc . Is a. hydrocarbon, i'nrbon and hy
dropen finer In greatly varying propor
tions into thÂ»* composition of thÂ» hydro
carbons. The Pennsylvania Illuminating
oil, constituting about sÂ»t per cent, of the
crude product, lias won tlxi world because
the proportions of carbon and hydrogen
gave a comparatively perfect combustion.
When distillation, us now known. ,i
best with California oil the illuminating
oil produced burns with an ill-smelling,
sooty Ilame been use there Is a treuter pro
portion of carbon, ami hence not enough
hydrogen to maintain complete combus
tion. That is the re. is. >ri why the cheap
oil of the corner grocery smells.
Mr. Cooper ha* been wrestling with this
problem for some years, and his labora
tory experiments have been lesion li â

which a hlKh-grado of illuminating Â1]

FOR WELL PEOPLE
An Easy Way to Keep Well.
It Is easy to keep well if we would only
observe each day a few simple rules of
health.
The all Important thing is to keep the
stomach right and to do this it la not
necessary to diet or to follow a set rule
or bill of fare. Such pampering simply
makes a capricious appetite and a feel-
Ing that certain favorite articles of food
mu.-t be avoided.
Prof. WlechoUl gives pretty good ad-
vice on this subject. II" say.-: "I am 63
years old and have never had a serious
Illness, and at the same time my life
has been largely an Indoor one. but I
early discovered that tho way to keep
healthy was to keep a healthy stomach,
not by eating bran crackers or dieting of
any sort; on the contrary I always eat
what my appetite craves, but for the past
eight years I have made it a dally prac-
tice to take one or two of Stuart Dys-
pepsia Tablets after each meal and I at-
tribute my robust health for a man of
my ape to the regular dally use of Stu-
art's Tablets.
"My physician first advised me to use
them because he said they were perfect-
ly harmless and were not a secret patent
medicine, but contained only the natural
digestives, peptones and diastase, and af-
ter using them a few weeks I have never
ceased to thank him for his advice.
"I honestly believe the habit of taking
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets after meals Is
the real health habit, because their use
brings health to the sick and ailing and
preserves health to the well and strong."
Men and women past fifty years of age
need a safe digestive after meals to in-
sure a perfect digestion and to ward off
disease, and the safest, best known and
most widely used is Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets.
They are found in every well regulated
household from Maine to California and
in Great Britain and Australia are rapidly
pushing their way into popular favor.
All druggists sell Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets, full sized packages at 60 cents
and for a weak Ftomnch a fifty cent pack-
ago will often do fifty dollars' worth of
good.

was washed Into the scuppers while try-
Ing to take a picture of a big roller that
was coming up astern, and had his back
hurt. Chief Officer Deering was thrown
against a stanchion, and still walks with
a limp as a consequence. One of the fire
men had his scalp cut, and the firemen's
mess boy still carries his arm In a sling
by having been thrown across the meas
room. Ons of the quartermasters was
also hurt.
Dr. Beverley Clark lost his pet monkey
overboard. The little animal escaped from
the doctor's room during the storm, and
Eomo of the sailors attempted to catch
It. The monkey got on the lee rail and
seemed fascinated with the bight of the
raging waters. As the men made a grab
at It the monkey put Its paws together
and, taking the attitude of a diver ready
for the plunge, went overboard. Dr. Clark
threw his pet a rope, but, although it
could be seen swimming In the heavy sea,
it could not reach tho rope, and was
drowned. That was the only fatality dur
ing the voyage.
Chief Steward James has a snap shot
of the wave that nearly cost him his
life. He had Just pressed the button when
the sea broke aboard and carried "Tom"
and his camera into the scuppers. The
same wave carried away two of the ship's
boats and smashed thorn Into kindling
wood; so everybody aboard Is anxious to
see that negative developed.
The full' wing puijSfneers came up on
the Zealandla.: Major Charles McClure,
paymaster, U. S. A.; Captain C. L. Pot
ter. Engineer Corps, U. H. A.; George G.
McClure, George Gibson McClurt-, B. J.
Slttig and J. R. Dv Chaucy, pay clerks,
I. fc>. A.; Captain T. P. Dorrls, master of
tho wrecked transport Morgan City; J.
J. Kenney ami William Keemer, dis
charged soldiers, and C D. Robinson. The
latter gentleman is in the contracting and
stevedoring business at Manila, and has
for a partner Fred Macondray, formerly
purser of the transport Valencia. They
had the contract to get the United States
cable ship Hooker oft the rocks at Cor
regldor, but failed, and the wreck has
been abandoned.
The Hooker was formerly the Spanish
steamer Panama, but was capturea soon
after tho outbreak of thw war and turned
into a United States trans-port. She was
sent to Manila with a cable for an lnter
lsland service, but was wrecked. All the
cable was got out of her by Robinson
A Macondray's men. but an examination
by divers showed that there was a hole
thirty feet long In The hull, and that the
machinery and boilers and everything else
In the hull were loose. The vessel was
then left to Its fate. Mr. Robinson says
that the Filipinos are beaten, and that
several of the captured Insurgents so ac
knowledged to him before he left Manila.
"They told me when talking about the
fighting." said Mr. Robinson yesterday,
"that they had been 'beaten good.' From
now on I think there will be little else
but guerrilla warfare. Lawton and Mac-
Arthur hayÂ© the island divided between
them, and Agulnaldo was in a corner
when we left. The cavalry has done
splendid service in Luzon, but there are
not enough horses down there. Uncle
Sam should send horÃes artd not men
from this time on. as the mounted troops
will end the warfare and not the In
fantry."
< "aptaln Dorrls of the wrecked Morgan
City comes home completely exonerated
from all blame by the Japanese court of
Inquiry. "Going through the Inland sea
I had a pilot who had been twenty years
in the business," said he yesterday,
"nevertheless he lost his way and r;in
the Morgan City hard and fast on the
beach. 1 had been continuously on the
bridge for twenty-six hours and went be
low to get a mouthful to eat. Twenty
minutes later the crash came. The offi
cers of the regiment we had aboard kept
splendid discipline, and there was no
panic. Everybody was landed and no
one hurt." While the court exonerated
Captain Dorrls the pilot lost hia com
mission and will never be able to navi
gate the inland waters as a master again.
While the Zealandia was at Manila Cap
tain J. Wallace of the American ship J.
R. Walker was married to a Miss Mo-
Kenzie of Yokohama. The young lady
went to Manila, and there the ceremony
was performed. Mrs. Wallace Is now on
her way to New York with her husband
on the J. B. Walker. Captain Wallace
Is the son of the well-known San Fran
cisco pilot.
The hearts of the priests at Malate
were made glad by the return of over
$12,000 worth of valuable relics while the
Zealandla was In Manila Ray. A com
pany of engineers drove a body of in
surgents out of a small town and there
found a lot of loot which the Filipinos
wero preparing to turn into rash. First
S-'rpeant Reardon of Company A, Knsrl
n< <r Â«'orps. was sent to notify the fath
ers that they could have the church
property whenever they wanted It. The
â¢ the priests was very great . as they
never expected to see the relics again.
The bodies of Captain H. J. McCrath
of the Fourth Cavalry. H. H. Hopkins.
Company F, First California, and Frank
J. Murray, Company A. First California,
arrived on the transport. Captain Mc-
Grath was killed a few days before the
Zealandla reached the Philippines. He
was out on the south firing line and was
shot In the leg. The wounded man was
tak<n to Manila and operated on, but
Oied n few days later Hopkins and Mur
ray were shot early In the war and were
burled In Manila. Their remains came
home consigned to Mayor Phelan.

AGAIN TO THE FBONT.
He Effects Another Compromise With
the Gas Company and Lighting
Contracts Go Over for
Six Months.
The attempt of P. A. Bergerot, Presi
dent of the Board of Education, to make
a postal card canvass of the School De-.
partment, In order to fix himself more
tirraly In the good graces of Mayor Phe
lan, has got the dapper little head of
things educational Into several different
temperatures of hot water. Ills fellow
members on the School Board, who are
not out for office, are giving him the
laugh In liis discomfiture. The teachers
among whom Bergerot tried to do his
politics, and the members of the women's
clubs who have been agitating the project
to have Mayor Phelan appoint two women
educators to the Incoming School Board,
havo risen In their Indignation and are
hurling at the Bergerot bead large and
well-seasoned bunches of criticism and
accusations of varied character.
To the postal cards which Bergerot sent
out the other day. In which he demanded
that every teacher In the Department de
clare herself either for or against the
proposition, Bergerot attached his official
signature as l'resident of the Board of
Education. It was a clever device, for It
gave to Bergerot's private political aspi
rations the semblance of ofllclai authorix
aticn. The only drawback to it was that
every teacher who got a postal discovered
the scheme and then got mad.
So far Mr. Bergerot has received only
forty odd replies to his list of questions
and according to a prominent teacher In
the department who was speaking of the
matter yesterday he can expect few more
Referring to the feeling against Bergerot
she paid:
"President Bergerot has Bimply used his
ofnVial position in an attempt to curry
fav.-r with Mayor Phelan. lie has not
only done that but he has tried to make
his capital out of us. I hope he Is sat
isfied with the result. If Mr. Bergerot
wants a position on the next School Board
he has no right to attempt to use the de
partment to further his personal ends. If
we want women on the next board we
will Inform Mayor Phelan and not Mr
Bergerot, of whose appointment as the
Mayor's agent we have not yet had no
tice."
The forty and odd postals received In
reply to Bcrgerot indicate a mixed desire
Some favor no women, others one woman
and others two women. Nearly all of
them, however, agree that Superintendent
\\ eÂ»>:-tcr should appoint a woman as one
of his deputies. A campaign with that
object in view has been started and the
opposition to W. D. Klngsbury's appoint
ment, which has already developed ia
strengthening. Klngsbury is in disfavor
with many of the leading lights of the
department and many wires are being
pulled to compel Webster to give that
particular dt-putyshlp to some woman
teacher. Otherwise the Board of Educa
tion plate stands v when last announced.
Mayor Phelan's singular silence regard
ing' "I 'polntments is worrying the Job
chasers. It Is already near the middle
of the last month and the Civil Service
Commission, upon which so much de
pends, is not yet announced, and the
"pollles." who have lately accustomed
themselves to a polish of grammar and
simple arithmetic, fear it will all wear off
before they have a chance to use it.
The bond elections are dividing interest
with the main question and the light that
was started against them has resulted in
bringing the Mayor into the arena, pan
handle in hand, to direct a counter cam
paign. Registration for the panhandle
election will close to-morrow night and
the sewer and schoolhouse bonds on
Thursday night of this week.
Mayor Phelan has finally had a talk
upon the street-lighting contracts with J
B. Crockett, president of the Gas and
Electric Company, and In a letter which
he has addressed to the Board of Su
pervisors, says that the company has
Bjrrmd to furnish street lights at tho com
promise price fixed last June, until the
end of the next half of the fiscal year
Mayor Phelan has agreed on his part to
have the late bids or the company either
laid on the table or rejected until the rate
Is regularly fixed by the charter Board of
Supervisors. k

VIL THE FOOLS OP SHAXES
PEABE.
(Concluded.)
It Is evident then, that Bhakespeare
places even the lowest order of his clowns
In Intimate relation to the main actions of
the plays. In their simplicity they not
only throw light on the conduct of the
main characters and unwittingly let out
the truth about these, but they keep the
principal Idea prominent by their actions.
Even their vulgarity counts. Of only two
of the early comedies can It be said that
the clowns are without appreciable Influ
ence upon the plotsâ the "Comedy of Er
rors" and "The Taming of the Shrew."
These show the 'prentice hand. In them
the clowns stand apart from the action of
the plays. Yet it Is to be remembered
that In all cf the plays preceding Shakes
peare the clown parts furnished notrlng
but Irrelevant buffoonery. The wonder Is
that he discovered so soon the dramatic
possibilities of the fool and made him
mean something In the dramatic scheme.
We may notice, too, In the early comedies
REDUCED FAC-SIMItB OP TITMJ PAQB OF SECOND QUARTO
F.I;ITION.
how the poet Is developing that mastery
over word and phrase, that facility of ver
bal invention, to which the adjective
"Shakespearean" Is applied. In the two
plays last named he seems to revel In now
found powers and to set no bounds to
their exercise; profusion of epithet de
lights him. It can be easily understood
how the fool element gave free play 10
his language Inventiveness. The fool
might be gorrulous. Inconsequential, In
exact and reckless In speech, but he was
expected to be ready and venturesome.
The fool-speeches may be regarded In
these early comedies as so many experi
ments In language. They test and try
one phrase after another to find out how
much It will yield. The fool seems to lis
ten to his own words In order to discover
their remotest suggestions as a basis for
his new ventures In wordy warfare.
Much of Shakespeare's later Ingenuity in
phrasemaking and much of the ease and
scope of his later diction con be traced to
the freedom with which he was permitted
to manage the language of the fools In
his earliest plays.
Leaving the Instinctive fools, like Cos
tard and Launce. and the mechanical buf
foons like Grumlo. and Dromlo of Ephe
sus. we reach the plays tn which Shakes
peare has presented fo>ls of a higher or
der, the fools of conscious wit and wis
domâlike those In "Lear." "Twelfth
Night" and "As Tou Like It." These men
know what they are about; they are In
line with nature, but they are playing a
part, however much they may dissemble.
Kent discovers that Lear's boy Is not all
fool, and although Cella refers to Touch
stone as x "natural." Jaques finds In him
the real character of humorist and phi
losopher. Either Touchstone Is wondrous
skillful In the first act In passing for a
pure fool or there are two fools In the
play. Dr. Furness puts the question thus:
"Is the 'clownish fool" and the 'roguish
clown' of the first act. with his bald Jests
of knights and pancakes, the Touchstone
of the fifth act. who has trod a meas
ure, flattered a lady, been politic with his
friend and smooth with his enemy? U
the simpleton of the first act 'nature's
natural' as he Is In truth, the same with
the Touchstone who can cite Ovid and
quarrel In print by the book? Are there
not here two separate characters?" If
there are two fools It cannot be doubted
which of the two Is the real Touchstone,
the real tester of human quality and char
acter and social situation, as the name
Touchstone Indicates. When Rosalind
says: "Thou speakest wiser than thou art
'ware of." Touchstone humors the belief
that he Is an Innocent: "Nay, I shall
ne'er be 'ware of mine own wit till I
break my shins against It." lie Is willing
to please and to be pleased, whatever es
timate may be nut on his abilities. He Is
content with the world, though he does
like to parody Its shams. Society does
not believe more strongly than Touch
stone. In talking with Cnrln. pretends to
believe that bad manners mean damna
tion. "Why, If thou never wast at court,
thou never sawest good manners; if thou
never sawest good manners, then thy
manners must be wicked, and wickedness
is sin. and sin Is damnation. Thou art In
a parlous state, shepherd." Touchstone's
alliance with Audrey is his humorous sa
tire on 111-mated couples and marring.**
not based upon true love. It Is "a poor
humor" of his to take 111-favored Audrey
because she Is honest.
The etiquette of quarreling and other
overwrought schemes of etiquette were
never treated with such delicious satire
as Touchstone's In the famous dii
tlon on the "seventh causo" <A<-t V
scene 4). And how ridiculous does this
wise and pleasant fool render those ever
dreary and ever-renewed discussions of
the relative merits of city and country
life, which usually come to naught h.
cause they assume that real happln.
pends on where a man lives rathrr than
on what he Is! Touchstone iln<ls tho
shepherd's life "In respect to Itself a
very good life: "but In respect that It is
a shepherd's life. It la naught"'â and with
mock seriousness he continues to paly <fr
thÂ© advantages and disadvantages (Act
111, scene 2> as his betters have done be
fore and since, purposely missing the
main points that would have made the
dlscuselon worth while. Jacques Is sup
posed to Interpret aright Touchstone's
character (act 11, scene 7), but the Duke
Senior Is also right when hÂ» Bays Act V,
seenÂ© 4) that Touchstone "uses his folly
like a stalking horse and under the pre
sentation of that he shoots his wit."
Touchstone* wit and satire Is. however,
of the kindly sort; he has no serious
complaint to make after all; he Is but
one In a world of Irresponsible*- a world
that la very pleasant with all of Its faults.
He breathes the romantic air of the for
est, like his betters, and is kept In har
mony with the prevailing mood of thÂ«
play, to which he Imparts a humorously
moralizing element.
Feste, the fool in "Twelfth Night." Is
not so wise as Touchstone, but he Is
more quick and facile. Shakespeare per
mits him to enjoy and understand almost
all of the other people In the play, an
advantage which Is denied to all save
Feste. If he Is not so Intimately wrought
into the texture of the plot as Touch
stone In "As You Like It." he seems to
preside over It everywhere. He con hard
ly be blamed for feeling his superiority,
for he Is the keenest of observers, ana
of ail Shakespeare's fools the most versa
tile. He feels both the comedy and the
romance of the changing situations, and
adapts himself to all of them with easÂ«
and geniality. The brightest of fools. he,
is usually "In very gracious fooling." Is
ready with "a love song or a song of
food life" for Sir
Toby, and can as
easily please the,
duke's lovesick hu
mor (which hn
knows to bo half
fudge) with a senti
mental song of woe.
The chief function
of the Shakespear
ian fool as crttlo
of the other char
acters is exemplled
In Feste more
plainly than in the
fools of the other
comedies. For In
this play the other
characters are so
engrossed with love
or wine or self-con
celt that the fool
may criticize them
impartially and
boldly, without dan
ger to himself. Ho

MOSES AND DARWIN.
Isaac Selby Contrasts Their Teach*
ings at Y. M. C. A. Auditorium.
Isaac Belby contrasted tho teachings of
Moses and Darwin yesterday afternoon
before a largo audience In the- Y. M. C.
A. auditorium. He contended that Dar
win's theory of the origin of man was
absolutely false find that the only true
solution of the problem of man 1 existence
lies In his creation by God. who had con
tided to Moses by revelation.
"Darwin comes to us." said Mr. Selby.
"with certain speculations of science
while Moses comes to us with thÂ© word
of God regarding man's creation, and the
latter Is entitled to our fullest credence
"While we must credit Charles Darwin
with all ho has contributed to natural
science and placo him among the. great
men of the world, we need not Indorse his
speculative opinion.
"Darwin Introduced thÂ© subject of evo
lution and based It on the similarity of
structure in the animal world, but this
similarity only goes to show that th.- *amÂ«
mind created both tho lower and hltrher
Sl JVh i.i ii l man , lf '"' ? Ood ' s uniformity

prove too mui'h.
"All that Darwin has discovered Moses
told many years before In thÂ© Book of
Life and It proves only that God created
the simpler forms of life ilrst. and tho
complex later, llnlshlng up with man on
the sixth day. Darwin's confessed Im
perfections In his genealogical record cer
tainly disproves his other reasonings by
analogy and demonstrate th.it Moses*
story of the creation was the only logical
and correct one."
Appeal for Hospital Donations.
In view of the near approach of Christ
mas. when everybody is supposed to bo
engaged In preparing a happy surprise
for some relative or friend. It has been
suggested that the Inmates of the City
and County Hospital should not be over
looked by th. charitably inclined peopla
of the city. Donations of old linen,
clothes, lint, easy chairs and blankets
will bo gratefully received for thÂ© we
and comfort of the patients of that In
stitution. An Insufficient appropriation
for the proper conduct of the hospital Is
said to have compelled the most rigid
economy In its management, hence do
nations such as those referred to would
be particularly acceptable at this time.
Miss May Patton, head nurse at the hos
pital, also suggests a theater party for
the nurses.

STARS TOO
MUCH FOR
THE LOCALS
Close Score in an Unexciting
Game at Recreaiion
San Francisco 2, All-California 3.
Thin is the sad story of a baseball game
in which tho local team worked oft
eight hits on the stars, scoring only
twice, while the men with polished ii.i
mond training hit only three times and
made a trio of run*. Johnson twirled for
the star men and was touched for a .
few choice strips of leather. I burg's slow
curves were not straightened very often,
and When they were they were of the
heaven-seraplnK Kind that do not fall to
â¦ arth. but in a. cradle of mitts
At the very start â¢ Brockhott purloined
first baM on I.r ad's error. "Heine"
K nig helped him around the bags with a
swift two-base lilt. For a time things
looked sky-rockety, but nothing of mo
ment happened, and the locals were re
tired with one tally to their credit."
Jealous of this overture, the "lamps of
heaven" began shining and when they
took the Held again Uncle Hank's cal
cium was dimmed by their greater re
fulgence. llertet had an honest ing to
first, skipped to second and third on a
paKsed ball and scored on Chance's hit.
Hulen walked, sending Chance to second.
Hoth these first magnitude shiners ad
vanced a base by theft, but Sullivan took
aversion to Hulen and threw to second,
trying to catch him off his bag. Josh
Rally Juggled the spheroid and Chance
went over the rubber.
The third Inning brought All-California
another run. thÂ»-lr last. Chance Jogged
to first and scored on a hit by I^ockhead.
In the sixth Pan Kranelsco added a stripe
to the *<-. re. Josh Rellly swatted a two
bagger to far center, quietly m.i<le third
base on Pyne's hit. and then Iburg got
into the game and started a fireworks
â hop of hip. own. sending Rellly over the
rubber to the benches far awny. That
was all the locals did In run-making, but
orn-e or twice t-hey were on the edge of a
precipice to tie the score. They leaped
not and lost.
Som* pretty fielding In the outskirts
was the feature of the day. Lockhead
showed himself to good advantage on
several occasions, eating up some buzz-
Ing, speedy files In voracious fashion.
The score was:

STATE FAIR
PROTEST IS
PASSED UPON
Naticnal Trotting Asscciation
Board of Review Decides
Some Racing Questions.
The board of view of the> National
Trotting Association, at Its recent session
In New York, decided two protests, which
were entered during the State Fair at
Sacramento. Involving questions which
have excited considerable Interest among
horsemen In this State.
The first protest was against allowing;
the mare Dr. I'r.t- â¢ plater, ownnl by
James W. Kea of San JoÂ«e. to start Ira
that stake because vhe wore hopplv*. At
the time the stake closed and this mar*
wan entered hoj>ples were not prohlbttril
by the National Trotting Association.
Subsequently and before the race that as
sociation adopted a rule prohibiting hop
ples. President A. H. Spreckcls ami
Director P. W. Covey of the BtatÂ»- Agri
cultural Society held that the conditions
of the race at the tlmo the stako clo.h.ml
should govern, and the mare was per
mitted to start. The board of review .it
New York has affirmed this ruling and
hereafter it will be the law thnt stakes
trotted on National Trotting Association
tracks , will be goverened nnd controllt-d
exclusively by the published conditions
and the rules us they existed at the tlmo
the stake closed.
The other protest was ngalnst permit
ting the colt Director Heir, own^l by A.
C Severance of Los Angeles to start. It
appeared that when th. third payment
was duo on entries In this stake. Mr*.
Severance wrote saying that she wixhi-d
to make third payment on her entry
Dlrectus, and that she wished Dlrert
Heir to be dropped from the stake. It ap
peared that this was a mlÂ«taki> of hÂ«-r
stenographer and that her intention was
to drop Dlrectus and pay upon Direct
Heir. She had no knowledge of the mis
take until a few days before the met was
trotted at the fair, and the protest was
made, aft her fourth and fifth payments
were made upon Direct Heir. The board
of review decided that she should be held
to the terms of her letter, and that a
mistake having occurred, the person who
made It should bear the -consequences
rather than third parties who probably
continued payments In the faith that the
colt Direct Heir had been dropped.

OAKLAND. I>ee. 10.~Another life was
added to-night to the long list of those
[raved from a watery grave by Charles
Kmlrvy. whose deeds of heroism while
tender of the Webster street bridge won
'for him the title of "Hero of the estuary
'cf San Antonio."- In fact, he ha* saved
two lives within the past twenty-four
hours.
Errlay at present Is tending Alice

i:ight. t-hortly afttr * o'clock, while seat
ed in his cabin, he hÂ«*sird a loud splash,
.followed Immediately by the voico of the
Harrison strvet bridge tender calling
"Man overbonrd." Emlay acted prompt
ly. Running out and plunging into the
water, he soon found a man floundering
and gasptaf as if about to sink for the
last time. With his usual prowess, the
heroic bridge tender swum with his hu
man burden to the nearest landing place,
.end after following the usual method for
resuscitating: such victims, pent the man
on his way.
The rescued man. hnwrn-or, was so much
under the Influence of liquor that he could
scarcely give hi* r.nme. which sounded
like Hans Nelson. From his Incoherent
mutterirjgs was gathered the fact that he
i.- a Swede employed on a vessel in the
harbor, and that lie fell off the bridge.
Only last night ESmlay rescued a drown
ing mnn from the water. On that occasion
Jilso the victim was intoxicated and had
fallen off the bridge. His name was not

ONE FINAL EFFORT
OF EBELL LADIES
Oakland Offlo* s.in Francisco Call, 90S Broadway, Dec. 10. (
The ladies of the F.bell Society
announce one final effort to com
plete the library site fund and It
will \>e â  .-!<> on Thursday even
ing at th<* First Presbyterian Church
and r-it Hamilton Hall, as at first an
n'ninrÂ«' when librarian Greene will
give nn illustrated lecture on libra-
Tim. There will be an excellent mu
sical programme and a few addresses
by prominent Oaklandcrs. The pro
ceeds will bo devoted to the site fund.
A little less than $3000 Is needed ard
it Is certun that the ladies will achieve
success alter their earnest efforts.
While efforts are bring made to
raise the money necessary fcr the site
the frontleman who secured from Mr.
CarnÂ«*pie the donation to Oakland hie
kept modestly in the background, sim
ply doing what he could to advance the
Interests of thÂ« fund. The man Is
Henry A. Chlttenden. for many years
a New York newspaper man. who
made the acquaintance of Andrew Car
negie and who conceded the thought
of writing and placing the neÂ«ds of
Oakland for a public library before him.
For the first time since the arrival of Mr. Carnegie's letter Mr. Chltten
den has made a statement.
"Now that Oakland's Four Hundred of the. Ebell Society are assured of
(success in their undertaking to raise twenty thousand dollars by popular sub
Brriptlon for the Free Public Library site," he says, "there Is hope of a speedy
settlement of that vexed question.
"What is wanted now. before all thingsâ may I be pardoned for calling It
our ling-felt want?â ls a proper housing of Oakland's library and the speedy
materialization of Mr. Carnegie's <lft. That devoutly wished consummation
is offered by the Ebell ladles' fair hands, upheld by a popular demonstration
that is creditable alike to Oakland, to the Ebell and to Mr. Carnegie.
"One word more This determination of the site question is far more be
coming to Oakland, as It must be more, grateful to Oakland's benefactor than
would have been any scheme to procure a costlier site involving the Indeli
cate nÂ«king of Mr. Carnegie to so partners In a tax levy or a bond scheme
or even In a people's subscription for the erection of a statelier library." â

MELROSE PEOPLE OBJECT.
They Complain of Neglect on the
Part of the Southern Pacific.
MELROSE. Dee. 10.â The people resid
ing In this vicinity have twice petitioned
the Southern Pacific Company to extend
Its local trains to Bather .station. A large
number of men reside with their families
in the neighborhood of Melrose, Sather
and High street, and It would save them
much time and inconvenience if the local
train could extend to Bather instead of
running only to Frultvale. It takes at
least twenty minutes to walk from their
residences to the Fruitvale station,
and on the cold. rainy mornings
of the winter months It is any
thing but a pleasant tramp. The dis
tance from the Prultvale depot to that at
Sather Is only a mile, and there is ample
t'me to makw the run and run on the
fame schedule as at present. The regular
commuters contend that it would be for
the financial interest of the company to
make this extension and carry psssfligf l%
through to Pan Francisco at the rates
which are now charged from Frultvale.
They argue that it would not work any
detriment to Frultvale and way stations
to make this change, but on the other
hand would serve to materially increase
the number of subruban residents around
th* neighborhood of Bather.
Several very fin* tracts of land have re
cenly been subdivided and placed upon
the market, and were a regular train
service established to that point many
families would locate upon lots which
they have purchased there.

OAKLAND
VINCENT MAY DE FROM
THE HOLD-UPS' BULLETS
Oakland Office Ran Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. Dec. 10.
THE carefully planned hold-up and attempted
cold-blooded murdrr of Robert Vincent last night
in front of his residence. 5C2 Sixth street, to
pether with all of Its sensational details, added
one more chapter to the Startling scries of rob
iwrifF that have been attempted in O.iklnnd of
late. That this was not another chapter of murder Is
due only to a miracle. The men who fired at Vincent
last nipht fired to kill, and they only missed their de
npn by one-sixteenth of an Inch. Had they struck that
dteta&ee to the rlÃht they would have cut Vincent's
spinal cord and cauÃed lnatant death.
The general opinion Is that the work Is that of the
same Rang that on the night of November 12 last mur
dared John Thomas in hie saloon at Campbell and Pa
treeta, when he refused to comply with the order
"Hands up!**
Oakland had scarcely recovered from the recent epi
demic of midnlKht hold-ups which ntarted with the job
at Peter Chrintianson's saloon, corner of Second and
Washington streets, on the night of October 31 last,
until it wus followed on November 4 by the bold If un
saecessful attempt to loot the safe and cash box at the
power house of the Alameda Electric Railway. On the
same ni^rht there was the more successful hold-up at
Coyne's saloon at Fifth and Peralta street, culminating
Â»n the cold-hlooded murder of John Thomas. Then the
Startling discovery was made four days Inter of several
â ticks of dynamite In the rear of the Standard Oil Com
- plant at Ninth and Campbell streets. Imperiling
â  d property in a large resident district in West
Oakland.
The signal success of the Police Department In frus
trating this last attempt at crime was marked hy a
sudden cessation 'Â»f operations on the part of the enml
and t=lnoe then, in the vernacular of the Htreet,
th.-y have been "lying low" until last midnight, when
â¢ Vincent was stood up und shot while fleeing
from the thug*.
Vinoent is the proprietor of a market at Wnshine
tfin strt-et. near Seventh. His place of business, as well
as his resilience. 5Â£2 Sixth street, only three blx-kH f r >m
hlsÂ« shop, are located In the very heart aud buslne^Â«Â» cen
ter of < 'akland. As was custnmarv on Saturday nights.
Vlnceat's market remained open very late, and when he
left he had In his possession the receipts of the day's
sales. siÂ«me $50. As usual. Mr. Vincent walked down
Wa.-hlnKton to Sixth strÂ«-et, thence along the n'Tth Hid.
of Sixth to <"lay, but <>ne block west. It was just after
he tiu'l crossed Clay street, and being perhups MVentr-
Bye fÂ»-et from his own home, when two masked men.
heavily armed, who had been lying in wait In a yard In
the rear of â  vacant two-story hou^e, corner of < "lay
and Sixth streets, sprang out in front of him and ordered
him to throw tip his hands.
The proximity of his home and the belief that he eouM
roach It before the thugs could Inflirt any Injury, prompt
ed Vincent to take to his heels and ret] at the t"j, of
bis vi>ic<*. As h*> left the sidewalk to reach the street.
one of the masked men leveled his revolver, took steady
aim and fir^d. The accuracy of the film Is evidenced by
the fart that the bullet penetrated Vincent's neck, and. as
h.Â» fill moaning, his assailants took to their hf-els, run
ning alÂ«'iiÃ (May stnet to tuke refuge along the water
front. They made no further attempt to secure Vincent's
money.

THE FRAWLEYS IN
WEAK MELODRAMA
mH. FRAWLEY knows his public;
p<. (!<,<Â»s li;ulilen Chambers, the
author Of "The Fatal Card." Mr
Krnwley befran by giving us good
plays with good companies, resorting oc
caxionally to melodrama as a spice to the
season; now he gives us melodrama with
an occasional good play as a sop to Cer
Â»Â»-nas and the companyâ well It is not
good. "The Fatal Card," by C. Hadden
Chamber*, is unblushing in its appeal to
the gallery. It lujrlns with an aborted
lynching and ends with an explosion of
dynamite and possesses throughout the
ira*s chanu fTI-tits of a "penny-dread
ful." No element of the true melodrama
Is omitted. There is the gentleman
rogue, the confederate sleek and slick,
the adventuress, the hero and the heroine
und the boy and the girl, the wily detec
tive, the injured innocent, the comedy re
lief and the slow musicâ the nlom 1 music
we have ulwnys with uk. The dialogue
Is as Imposstbl* en* George Meredith's, but
in another way. It is sententious or sen
timental. <oy or cunning, as the case de
niamlh. and always hustling with lighten
ing rods to catch applause.
I do not see how actors of intelligence
can be at any pains to perfect themselves
in such a play and that Is pornaps one
reason why Mr. Frawley's players are bo
ineffective. The other reason Is that
most of ihtm don't know how to act. lt.ir
NEWS
of the Bay Cities
It Is evident that the hold-up was carefully planned. i
as nave been all the recent hold-ups, for the thugs must '
Y e known that Vincent carried his day's receipts home,
and the vacant house near his residence afforded them ,
an excellent hi.llng-placo wherein to waylay their victim.
They had. moreover, figured out the time of Vincent's
arrival and the time that Officer Flynn usually reaches i
sixth and Jefferson streets on his patrol, which was not
many minutes prior to the shooting.
The shooting aroused the neighborhood. Lee Gilbert, '
Mr. Vincent's next-door neighbor, was Just retiring when i
he heard the one shot tired. He peered out through his
front bedroom window, and says he saw two men of *
medium height run toward Clay street and turn the ,
corner.
"I did not kndw what the shootlp** was about," he '
said to-day, "but I saw Mr. Vincent stnegerlng toward his <
â¢fate next door, and I instantly realized that he must Â
have been shot."
p At the Receiving Hospital, whither John Rohan and *
W. H. Houghton. who were attracted by the shooting. -<
immediately carried the Injured man. Dr. W. 8. Porter i
extracted the bullet. Vincent's escape from death was
of such narrow margin that the extraction of the bullet <
required a most careful and delicate operation. The <
bullet had penetrated just one-sixteenth of an inch to the
left of the spinal cord, and taking an upward course, '
Imbedded Itself In the left jaw. Mr. Vincent has been .
removed to his home and Dr. Porter continues In attend
ance. The Injured man Is not out of danger by any
means, the fear of blood poison setting In being the most â¢
impending.
The police have been at work on the case all day. Just
an soon as the affair was reported to headquarters squads
of officers and specials were detailed to scour the whole
district below Seventh street, including the entire south ,
water front, and every belated pedestrian was halted
and had to give a satisfactory account of himself. The
open boldness of the hold-ups strikes terror not only to â¢
the citizens, but to the police, for notwithstanding the
utmost diligence the criminals implicated have evaded
â¦ very avenue that might lead to their capture. It Is '
apparent, too. that the murder of John Thomas and his
murderer's successful concealment of Identification has
tended to embolden the criminals in their work.
One clewâ and only one. though It may prove invalua
âwas found to-day. The police have In their posses
sion two hats that no doubt were worn by the foot- -
pads Just prior to the hold-up. Mr. Vincent has Stated
his belief that hi.* assailant! were young men, and the
hats found are such as would most likely be worn by
young men. The hats, one an ordinary black derby
and the other a plain Fedora, were found In the yard 1 at
the rear of the vacant house. 19 Clay street, where the
footpads had been lying m wait for their victim. These
hats had been left lying In the corner of the yard near
est Sixth street, and the footpads during their actual
work had substituted ordinary black slouch hats, which
could be pulled 'down well over the eyes to hold their
masks perhaps. The appearance of neighbors on the
scene so soon after the shooting no doubt hastened the
footpads in taking to their heels and prevented them
from reclaiming their original head covering.
Chief of Police Hodgklns expresses the belief that the
assailants of Vincent are new at the business.
"I really believe that these two fellows are novices. No
professional crook would have found any reason to shoot
at a man under the circumstances in Vincent's case. He
was running away from them and was yelling and one
pistol shot would Instantly arouse the whole neighbor
hood. I moreover believe that the assailants were young
men and. If a strong effort will land them where they
belong, we certainly have hopes.

HIGHWAYMEN ARRESTED.
Deputy Sheriff Howell Captures Them
After a Desperate Fight.
PORTLAND, Dec. 10.-A special to the
Oregonian from The Dalles nays:
Deputy Sheriff Howell of Pasco County
had an exciting experience to-day with
two men. Brown and Wilson, whom he
had arrested on the Canyon City road
on charges of horsesteallng In this county
and highway robbery In Portland. Deputy
Howell arrested the men, who were on
horseback, near the top of the Deschutes
grades, and having only one pair of hand
cuffs put them on Brown. He tied the
horses' bridles together and started hln
prisoners ahead of him. Wilson, with his
pocketknife. cut the bridle, and both men
started down the grade at full speed
Howell In pursuit. After a chaae of a mile
he shot Wilson's horse from under him
and without further difficulty recaptured
his prisoners. Wilson has a gunshot
wound In the back, which he Is supposed
to have received In a fight with officer*
In Portland a few days ago.

THERE WILL BE
SOLDIERS FOR A
YEAR TO COME
Thousands Still for
the Islands.
WHERE THE TROOPS ARE NOW
NOT ENOUGH ARTILLERYMEN
TO MAN THE GUNS.
Army of 100.000 Renewed Within
Twelve Months â Congress
Expected to Increase
the Force.
As soon as the weather permit*
tents at the Presidio will h.- taken down
and everything movable will |
from the camps and will b.^ Stared
to be In readiness for another cmi ri
PUc-h as caused thrlr first .... uj
The buildinÃs. the piping and the .s.wr
)ng will be left, but everything else will i
be cleared away.
It will not be for very long, however. '
for within a few months the tentd will
again have to be put into us.-, for until
the muster out or the votonteen now ir.
the Islands the Presidio will be as big a |
military post as ever It ha* been.
By July 1, 1901. twenty-four rt-glments
of Infantry and one regiment of cavalry
will have to be mustered out. and every
one of them will have to be brought back !
to this country. There will !).â¢ m. â¢
ports to spi-ak of on the Atlantic
ut that time, and as a consequence ti. y
will all have to come back through this
port. Besides that, of the twenty-nv.
thousand regular Ir. the Philippines two
thirds of them will have been mu>
out within the next Â»ight#'.n months and
they. t0... wi1l have to be brought Lack
through the Presidio. In all th. trooos
moving eastward through San Francisco
from now until July of 1901 will amount
to more than forty-five thousand.
In the meantime, hnwÂ»*v.T. the force in
the Philippines must be kept up and con
servative estimates put five hun.lr. 1 men
a month as the very smallest possible
number with which the present force can
be recruited. It iÂ« believed thai th. >;..\
ernment will not attempt to maintain ;hÂ»
volunteer commands at th-tr original
strength, for it would not be worth v/hile
term. As a consequence, the volunt.-.-r
to enlist men for the remainder of their
regiments will probably Â»>^ left to flit up .
their own ranks by consolidating bat- j
talions and companies, perhaps, until the â 
time comes for them all to go.
Five hundred men a month means
twenty-five hundred applicants a m.'t'th
for enlistment, but the rrcrultin* offices
can get that number easily. As a n
of fact, nearly thi- entire strength of the
present army of the I'nlted States, prac
tically a hundred thousand men has been
recruited since the beginning of January
jsvs. Before the Spanish war th>- compa
nies of the regular army rarely numbered
more than sixty men. and the regimt-nts
were of only two battalions. Wh. n the
war opened the companies were recruit- i
ed up to one hundred and six men. md
ai. other battalion, four companies, wa..* ;
added to each regiment. Nearly all I
new recruits were men enlisted un I
order Shat allowed them their diii-har*e*
upon application ar soon as thi
closed. As soon as peace was declared
they commenced to apply for their Jl.Â«
charges. and since then they have all
been M go Yet the regular army la still
at its full strength. m..rÂ»- than a bo I

that, the State volunteers hnv.- all been !

ments of volunteer infantry, making
al'.ne a force of more than thirty thou

since last June, and all hut sown of thÂ»se
regiments have gone to Manila through

There Is a force In Manila now of close

to the Forty-ninth are all in Mnnlla. with
the exception of the Forty-ninth, which
Is on Its way there, and the Forty-eighth,
now In quarantine at Angel Island, which
will start for there as soon as It is freed
It can he seen from this that practi
cally all the Infantry and a good part of
the artillery is used In garrisoning for
eign possessions that two years ago this
country had no Idea It would ever own.
It will be seen, too. that all the troops at
home are no more than enough to keep
the posts regularly manned, and there 1*
hardly enough artillerymen to keep the
guns clean and free from rust, let alone
keeping them In proper condition. For
this reason It Is becoming more evident
that th*Â»re will be no Increase of garri
sons at the Presidio or anywhere else.
It Is this condition of affairs which
leads army officers to hold the opinion
that there will b# a great deal doing In
the military line at the present Congress.
If th* volunteers now In the Philippines
are let go without something to supply
their places there will hardly be 1.-ft h
soldier In this country. It will take *s,i>>)
men to garrison properly the Philippines
for some years to come, and there Is not
much more Infantry than that In the
army now. As to artillery, there is n>t
enough In the whole corps to man the
guns now mounted for roast defense.
It Is expected that. In view of thÂ»sÂ«
facts. Congress will Increase the army,
but by how much Is still a problem. If
It does not. and by July 1. WH, the army
in the Philippines has not (fuelled the In
surrection, there will be a peculiar staie
of affairs. The volunteers fust sent over
will have to be returned to their homes,
and there will be nothing for the >J..\
ernment to do but to provide for mor*
Sooner than do this, and In view of the
Increased territory to be guarded. It Is
expected a substantial Increase In th*
army will be made At any rate, for an
other year and a half San Francisco wIU
hold the new and suddenly attained posi
tion of the foremost military post In the
country, and soldiers will continue to
throng the streets of this city for a long
time yet.

from you by mall, much to my surprise, give
me perfect satisfaction. When I ordered them
I very much doubted your ability to suit me.

them. I have Just had three sets of glasses
made to order, but since I have been using
yours I have filed the others away on a back

Mr. George Mayerle, San Franciscoâ Dear Sir:
I received your glasses about August 14. Just as
we were sailing (ran Guantanamo for New

Journey before reaching me. which they did In
good order. They fit beautifully, and I have
been using them constantly since they came.
Yours sincerely, W. T. SAMPSON.

Mr. Mayerleâ Dear Sir: My eyes have been
watery and were Inflamed and very painful a
long time. The glasses that have been prescribed
by doctors and opticians seemed to suit me fine
when I first put them on, but caused awful
pain after using them awhile; but your glasses
have entirely cured my eyes. I can use them
with comfort. JOHN SETINPFLE,

FATHER GRANT
DEFENDED HIS
ABSENT FRIEND
Openly Criticized the
Monitor.
CONGREGATION IS SURPRISED
Rev. Father James A. Grant, assistant
pastor of St. Peter's Church, which Is
now presided over by Rev. Father Yorke,
has taken umbrage at an editorial which
appeared in the last issue of the Monitor.
It was entitled "A New Head for the
Church?" and reflected on his friend, Rev.
Father \V. D. McKinnon, chaplain in thÂ«
United States army. Father Grant took
occasion to make a statement to his con
gregation before delivering his sermon at
the 10:30 o'clock mass yesterday, declar
ing in unmistakable terms that the edi
torial was such that it called for an em
phatic repudiation. His re-marks created
a mild sensation among the parishioners.
In explanation of his action In criticiz
ing the- tdltor of the leading Catholic
organ of thlÃ city. Father Grant informed
his auditors that some time ago the
jirh sts of the archdiocese were asked to
engago the people to subscribe to the
Monitor, and. In doing so, engaged them
selves to a certain extent to accept opin
ions expressed therein. He took It that
the priests might therefore be supposed
to indorse what had been said editorially
concerning Father McKinnon. Father
Grant then stated that the editorial which
appeared In last Saturday's issue was
particularly offensive to the friends of
the absent army chaplain. He said
further that, although Father McKJn
non's name was not mentioned, the edi
torial was a comment on a dispatch
printed lately In the San Fraiicvlsco
papers, purporting to have come from the
chaplain and addressed to the Archbishop
of Manila. He then read the alleged dis
patch and part of the editorial accom
panying It:
About the middle of last month the fol
lowing cable message was received at Ma
nila and published In the local newspapers
there:
"We leave In a few days. His Holiness
appointing me as coadjutor under you. Im
pressions are false. My letters will precede
me and come direct fn.m Rome to you.
Archbishop Ireland Indorsed the same.
President McKinley knows of the present
steps being now taken by the hierarchy of
the church."
The message was read by the direction of
the Archbishop of Manila, to whom It was
directed In the form of an encyclical, and
the Archbishop announced that be Intended
to remain In his place In Manila, unless
silenced. He expressed a longing for an
ending of the n-belllon.
Father Grant continued, statin?, that
the editor of the Monitor made a protest
against State interference in the appoint
ment of Catholic prelates. Aa the dis
patch, he i-aid, was supposed to have
come from Father McKlnnon. It lo>Toa
upon the reafler the Impression that
Praaident McKinley had interfered in tho
supposed appointment of the popular
pijirltual adviser of the California Volun
teers as coadjutor of Manila.
"Aa there is no possible reason to sup
pose the dispatch is true," said Father
â¢ Irant, "and as there never was a ques
tion of Father McKlnnon being appoint
ed coadjutor to the Archbishop of Manila,
and as the article leaves upon the reader
the impression that Father McKlnnon
consented to State Interference In this
supposed appointment, I think a great In
justice has been done him."
In concluding his remarks Father Grant
said that, as an old friend of the absent
priest, he wished to mate that this opin
ion expressed in the Monitor was such as
called for an emphatic repudiation. Hav
ing delivered himself of the foregoing re
marks, the ppeaker proceeded to preach
on the gosptl of tho day.
REV. DR. WOODS PRAYS THAT
POLYGAMY WILL BE REMOVED
In a prelude to his regular sermon Rev.
E. A. Woods of the First Baptist Church
last night dwelt on "Bigamist Roberts and
Congress. " lie said:
Salt Lake City was founded by the Mor
mons In 1848. Polygamy was prohibited In
Utah by an act of Congress called the Ed
munds bli In I*B2. By a constitutional con
vention in Utah polygamy was prohibited in
UST. Utah was admitted as a State in IW6.
with a euk-mn agreement that polygamy
wa6 and forever should remain unlawiul
It Is in evlde'.n.- th;it Mr. Robatta, who
now asks to be admitted to Congress,
pleaded guilty to the charge of polygamy In
Ând wan Imprisoned lor a period of four'
months. It Is also In evidence that Rob
erts, in violation of the law of Utah and
of the United States, has continued to live
with three wives up to the present time and
haÂ» a number of children born by such
union.
Mr. Roberts' claim Is that he has been
regularly elected to Congress and therefore
hu-H a right to hlg seat, and ttiat any action
t.y 1 ungress can only be by expulsion and
not be by refusing him admittance; also
that the proclamation of President Harrison
cranted pardon to those who had broken
thl.Â« law. The plea, is also made that he Is
morally bound not to turn adrift his wives
and children. It Is said In reply that Con
gress must decide whether the legal method
of dealing with his case tihall be by action
to prevent his taking his seat or by expul
sion afterward. As to the pardon by the
1 l^nt the fact that he has continued
his lift of polygamy forbids his claim. He
ouÂ»!Â»t. of course, care for hU wives and
children, but he can do this without a con
tinued Violation of the law of the land.
Let all good people bopa and i<ray that
the curse of polygamy, which haÂ» disgraced
our nation for a half-century, be entirely
removi.-J.
REV. DR. BEYIER GLORIES IN
BIGAMIST ROBERTS' DOWNFALL
Row Herbert N. I<< vi.r, pastor of Me
morial Presbyterian Church, lv his sermon
yÂ» st<rday on the text, "I^pt God arise;
let his 1 1.. mies be scattered, ' alluded to
-h.Tts case. He said In part:
"This text has had notal.l â  vimlicat'cn
in the course of recent events. God ins
grandly arisen in hit* mlgi.r. The pubic
conaciencc has UMtted Its divine rro
roffallve and the menaced American hume
Is sivi'il. COUW anything be more rnag
niflcently eloquent than thf.se seven
rolls of petitions with their 700.000 names?
Was It not like bringing the law Into the
â ynagOKUa aid appealing unto the testi
mony? It was the state, the divine intti
tutinn of government rlsl g to the pro
tection of the home, which is Its divine
unit. Once again we have abundant evi
dence that <>n vital mural questions thÂ©
heart of the nation is right.
"From 1 his hour, then, let polygamists
beware; from this hour let all moral
plagfM npots clean up. Are we not on the
threshold of a new revival of vtrtuo?
Surely Moses and Sln.il and the religion
of Christ, who came not to destroy but
to fulfill the law, are still the II Ing spir
itual forces of the nation. All this is but
another indication thatâ
â¢â¢ 'God is on the throne;
All's right with the world.' "
DR. NELANDER DISCUSSES THE
MISSION OF THE FAIR SEX
Rev. E. Nelander of the First English
Lutheran Church last night addressed his
congregation on "The Mission of Woman
Under the Gcspel." In part he said:
It Is frequently said by way of criticism
that the majority of members of the Chris
tian church are women. It Is true that two
thirds <f church membership Is of the
gentler sex. It Is also true that seven
eighths Of the Inmates of our prisons and
penitentiaries are men. It Is not easy to
see how any fair deduction from those two
premises can place any discredit upon the
church for her preponderance of female
mt-mbt-rfhlp. It would seem, on the con
trary, to speak well for her purity of char
acter. Nowhere can fry produced such f.-
niMle portiiiits as adorn the pages of the
Bible.
Jesus Christ opened a new and brilliant
career to the female race. The birthright
of women under the gospel does not con
sist in vague and distant adoration, nor in
extravagant and romantic Kallantry. but it
ambraoM the intelligent compaoloaablp of
man and Intrusts her with every blessed
agency of usefulness. The obligations of
gratitude alone shuuld bind every woman
to Jesus Christ In a willing and faithful
devotion.

PLUNGING HORSE
IMPERILS LIVES
OF THREE PEOPLE
Accident in Golden
Gate Park.
WILLIAM MATHEWS HJURED
An accident in which Miss Morie. who
resides at 239 Powell street, and Mr. and
Mrs. William Mathews of 257 Twelfth
avenue, narrowly escaped serious if not
fatal injury, occurred shortly after 4
o'clock yesterday afternoon in Golden
Gate Park, near the Cyclers' Rest.
Miss Morie wai mounted on a spirited
horse. When near the Rest the animal
took fright and plunged across the road,
colliding with terrible force with a horse
driven by Mr. Mathews. Mr. Mathews 1
animal was almutt thrown from its feet
end in whf-eling to save itself fell, upset
ting the huggv and hurling Mr. and Mrs.
Matlu-ws headlong to the ground.
The Mathiws" horse then took fright,
and, drugging the upturned buggy, dashed
into the cycle path. After :i run of about
a hundred yards the horse became entan
fled in a wire turf protector and fell,
'wo cyclers, one a Mr. Hanque, held
down the animal until the police relieved
them.
Mrs. Mathews. after being thrown from
the buggy, immediately Jumped up, hav
ing fortunately escaped uninjured, and as
sisted Borne friends to place in a buggy
her husband, who was suffering from
concussion and a laceration of the scalp.
Mat hews was removed to his home, and
although painfully is not seriously in
jured. Miss Morie got her horse under
control and continued unassisted to her
home.
Lewis Michelson, who said he resided at
209 Post street, and Harry Wilson of 49
Stockton street attempted to run the park
v.stÂ«rday afternoon and fell into the
hands of the police. The two young men
were out driving, and when their horse
developed too much speed Mounted Officer
Manuel de la Guerra rounded them up.
Michelson got angry and threatened to
kill the officer if he touched the horse.
Wilson contented himself by cursing De
la Guerra. The officer, however, took them
to the station, where they remained un
til Michelson deposited $40 and Wilson $20
bail.
Later In the day Lewis Michelson's
brother. Bill Michelson. went to the sta
tion and started to roast the police. On
the order of Captain Thompson he was
thrown out without ceremony.
During the afternoon a party of four
driving in a rockaway had one of their
trart-s broken by a fractious horse. The
damage was repaired by I'.iptain Thomp
son and the party drove on.
A man whose name could not be ascer
tained received a fracture of the Jaw
while wielding a baseball bat. He was
taken to the Receiving Hospital.
Yesterday was feature day at the
Chinos. Major Mite, in hts laughable imi
tation of Cornille singing coon songs, and
Frank Hall, in his daring act with Wal
lace, the big lion, were the attractions in
the theater. Miss Ella Burt coasted the
chutes on a bicycle and took away the
breath of the crowd. The high divers add
ed to the excitement, and to finish the day
of pleasure Emil Markebeurg made a bal
loon ascension and parachute drop. The
aeronaut went up about .VÂ«1O feet before
cutting lnofe in hts parachute and landed
without injury in the panhandle of the
park.

REED'S WILL LIKE A

It into his will, for in more than one
way it is a curiosityâ not so much
fur what is in It. but for the effect it will
have upon his estate and upon any legal

Garcia girl lias not come forward for her
share yet. lut she will, and it louks as
if s-he would git what she is after. Tor
the will was ::ot drawn by a 'prcnticu

It is the r.enrral belief that th* child to
whom RÂ«Â«d left so much of his fortune
was his own natural child, but there is
no one to say to, and. what is more, it
cuts no licure in the probating <<t the

to her; :h'. re is n<> attempt to say who n'nvi

ho was fon<l of her mother: because he
had taken a fancy to her; because he had
any one of. â  dozen reasons, any one of
which was nobody's buslnes but his own.
Ho may have left uer the property be
cause ne wished to, and so far as the
lawyers can po, that must suffice, for the
old man knew how to express what ho
wanted without saying too much. The
question of a contest of the will is. there
fore, a debatable matter.
Should there be a contest there will
probably be a scandal. Everybody ex
pects it. and they would not be disap
?>ointed. but in the end It will.} be but
little use, for the scandal would n< ' hresV
Lt>e will, and the legacy would still be is
pood as gold.
Mrs. Garcia has already started on the
business of securing to her child me
fortune in store for her. She called on
Orestes Orena; of the firm of Hlshop .V:
Wheeler, last Friday, and told him who
she was. She wished particularly to
know what was the prospect of getting
an allowance for the child, as she wanted
above all things to have her properly
educated. On the question of allowance,
however, there is a line point. If the al
lowance is to come from the estate the
child will have to prove that the is the
child of the testator, for otherwise she
can have no family allowance, If. how
ever, she wishes to pet it from her own
part of the estate it is different. The mat
ter was not detlnitely settled, however.
In the meantime the trustee, Justo Vl
dal. baa dropped out of sight. He was a
frequent visitor at the Reed home during
the life of John Reed, and at the timo of
his oVath was staying there. Since then,
however, he has left; and sine.- the pub
lication of the peculiar terms of the will
he has not been heard of at the old lib., c.
Mr*. Garcia told Orena that she had
known Vi.'.ul for a lons time. She gave,
the lawyer the Idea, too, that neither she
nor her* child had seen or had had any
thing to do with Reed, and the presump
tion is that si:, kept track of Reed
through his friend Yidal. She Is a small
woman, apparently about 40 years of age,
good looking, well dressed, and has not
the appearance of a woman who has had
to work hard.
The property 1. ft to the child Is vari
ously valued at from $13,000 to $25,000. 'It

may be sold and the proceeds turned over
to the child, or at least an Income from

without issue before she is 21. the prop
erty is tÂ£Â» go to the members of the Reed
family. if >:..- die with Issue before she
is 21 the property will en to her children.
If she reach the age of D she will be Riven

will be hard work for the lawyers to find
a loophole; so far the only one' is: "Is the

mentioned In the will of John J. Reed?"

CRIED OUT "THIS ENDS ALL"
HE WENT TO HIS DEATH NEAR
FISHERMAN'S WHARF.
Two People Saw the Well-Dressed
Stranger's Plunge, but Were
Tardy in Giving an
Alarm.
Ab the *t earner San Rafael was making
her last trip from the Marin Shore to this
city last evening an unknown man com
mitted suicide when the Vessel was oppo
site Fiphermuns wharf by jumping from
the rail Into the waters of the bay. Th?re
were only two witnesses to the scene, a
small boy, whose name the pssscinfi rs
forgot to as' â¢ rtaln, and a person who
sis name as Boyle ami told captain
McKenzle that ho was employed In the
business office of the Kxamlnt r.
According to Captain McKensto, the
suicide might have been prevented had
it not been for Boyle's stupidity in fall
ing to Kive a prompt alarm.
The Ban Rafael was making the swing
toward her slip when Boyle rushed into
the pilot bouse and said that a man had
| jumped overboard near Fisherman's

against a Bagpole In the stern and watch

the news around that city and San Ra

BOLD ROBBERS
ATTACK A GROCER
I Â«=jr=3HE fact that th. police have not yet captured the robbers who have
been operating In the city for the past two or three months was forcibly
j[ brought Saturday night to the attention of F. L. Rahn, proprietor of a
grocery and saloon on the northeast corner of Sacramento and Taylor
streets.
,'Â« About 9 o'clock Rahn was in the grocery alone when three strangers en
, tered. One of them ordered three beers. Rahn went to draw the beer and as
> he turned to serve It he saw a revolver In the hands of th. oldest-looking of
' the trio. The man slipped it Into his pocket, crossed to the lunch counter
â  and suggested to Rahn that he should get them some cheese and crackers.
', Rahn went Into the grocery and returned with the crackers and cheese, which
, ho placed on the lunch counter. As he turned he looked into the muzzle of a
â¢ revolver in the hands of the man who had done all the talking.
[ ' "Now. you keep quiet." said the robber, in a determined voice, "or It will
" be the worse for you."
\ Rahn, who is stockily built, al once showed fight. He attempted to grap
, pie with the robber, when another of the trio pulled a revolver out of his
âº pocket and. cautioning his pal not to shoot, struck Rahn a heavy blow on' the
' back of the head with the butt end of his revolver. Rahn yelled for the po
l lice, while he was again and again struck on the head with the revolver. His
> cries for help alarmed the robbers and the trio finally rushed out of the gro
. eery without getting any booty.
âº A few minutes later Rahn was found lying on the floor of the grocery In
| â¢â  pool of blood by M. 1.. Ahllnger and Fernando Loualzo, who happened to
i drop Into the store. They, immediately notified the police. Yesterday morning
, Captain Bobcn detailed Detective Ed Gibson oh the case. Rahn told Gibson
â â  that he thought he was attacked for revenge, as he had had trouble with a
Â» man on Thanksgiving night and the man declared he would get even with
I him. but Gibson found that the suspected man was a carpenter In the
Â neighborhood and was above suspicion. He was satisfied that the three men'
> were robbers and not new to the business.
âº . Rahn described the trio as follows: No. 1. 34 years of age. dark sack suit
: soft dark hat. small light mustache: No. 2. who struck .him with the re
> volvcr. 21 years of age. smooth face, dark sack coat, dark soft hat: No. 3 who
> appeared to be the lookout, 27 years of age, smooth face, dark clothes and
> hat.
âº When peon yesterday Rahn.- who bears souvenirs of the affair In the
â shape of a large plaster fore and aft of his cranium, gave the following ac
âº count of the fracas:
> "About 9 o'clock three men came Into the barroom through the door com
> munlcating with the grocery and ordered beer. When I had served them
â ' one, a tall man, with a black mustache, walked over to a shelf where
' crackers and cheese are generally kept, and after raising a screen which is
> kept over the dishes, asked me to get some cheese. I went into the store and
âº returned with some and walked over to the corner to place It In the plate.
- While I was doing this I was struck a terrific blow on the back of the head!
' and on turning around the man who had made the request for more cheese
, struck me again, this time on the forehead with the butt of his pis
- tol. At the same time the other, a clean-shaved man of about 30. covered
> mo with his pistol and told me to keep quiet. Instead of complying. I shouted

"Just before the hold-up I had emptied the till and had some hundred dol

DR. RADER EXPRESSED HIS
VIEWS ON THE GOLDEN RULE
Rev. William Rader's sermons on the
tragedies of Shakespeare are attracting
unusual Interest and every Sunday even
ing the Third Congregational Church Is
Crowded. Last night seats were hard to
obtain and the regular congregation gra
ciously Rave up Its seats to Strangers. Dr.
Rader spoke on "The Merchant of Venice
â the Drama of the Golden Rule." In part
he said:
The "Merchant of Venice" In not a trag
edy, but a catastrophe. It Is located In the.
Rlalto of Venice, immortalized by KuÂ»kln.
and associated with the dissipation of Lori
Hyron. It I* composed of two stories, that
of the pound of flesh and the three boxes.
The play centers In Jessica, who ran away
with a Christian ami broke her father's
heart; In Antonio, meek and gentle, and
!'â  rtla, who In a new woman of Intellect
rather than feeling, fascinating, eloquent
and audacious. Shylock Is probably not
meant to he a universal type of lletii-Hw.
He represents Judaism without Its (<â .â¢..â .â¢!
ness. The Jew has been the victim of con
siderable criticism from Marlowe to Mark
Twain. He was a fanatic holding tn the
Mt.lical law of an eye for an eye and a tooth
lor a tooth. He hated Antonio, and his
si*-ei-h is unanswerable irom ShylÂ«.k Â»
standpoint.
Both Antonio and Phylock indicate a la
mÂ«ntable lack, nf the spirit of the gulden
rule, which unites the elements at Justice
and mercy. I'ortia Is the mediating prln-
In her speech HhakÂ»-H|>eare shows
that the admlnl- tratlon of the universe Is
not on a basis of Justice, but Justice sea
s'. ne,l with mercy. The world is not ruled
In Justice a i >art from mercy, and If It were
so ruled, what would become of mnÂ«t of us?
Mr llader warned his hearers to be care
ful about the David Harum rendering of the
gulden rul-: frlio unto the .â¢th-r fwlow as
he would <io unto JTOU, but do it first."
SHE WAS POISONED.
Lizzie Kiesel of Fruitvale in Convul-
sions Crossing the Bay.

cars to be sent to the Oakland Keceiving
Hospital.
Several times before the train reached
Broadway, about 1:20 o'clock this morn
ing, she was convuised with agony. At
the hospital the doctors said she was suf
ft-rtiiK from poison of some sort, whleh
they could not then determine. The pa
tient said she had been put on the boat
at San Francisco by a man named HÂ»ll.
She will probably recover.
The woman stated that she had been In
the company of Gilbert Bell, ;i letter-car
rier of San Francisco, but would give no
further information.

sel of the new Interisland shipping com
pany that Is to run schooners between the
Islands of the Hawaiian group.
' The vessel is the gasoline schooner
Surprise, launched at Benecia last Thurs

anil the usual crowd of well-wishers and
the christening went off as successfully
as It was possible to make It. The bot
tle broke, just on the bow and as the
wine foamed over the stem Miss L,indÃey
